00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome to a special, I guess a bonus episode here on the Pro Crastinators channel.
00:00:06 Today, me and my airmanos are going to be talking about a little story you might have heard of called The Triflers.
00:00:14 That's right, it's the world famous earth shattering book by our friend Mumkey Jones here.
00:00:20 And we're just going to talk about it. I just read it on the plane from Anime Expo and I finished it.
00:00:28 And I'm bursting with things to say about it and points to make and brilliant bits of rhetoric to expunge for my being.
00:00:37 So that's why I'm here. I don't know what their excuse is for being here.
00:00:40 Oh, Mumkey for book sales. For book sales, of course.
00:00:43 Yeah, I'm just here to sell books. I don't give a shit about you guys.
00:00:48 Jesse just read it last night, right?
00:00:50 Last night, I bought it months ago. I read 10 pages. I got to the part where Don gets locked in the freezer and that's where I stopped.
00:01:01 It's like 10 pages to half way through the book.
00:01:04 That's pretty far. I couldn't pick the book up anymore because I just hate Mumkey so much.
00:01:11 Last night, because Nate had posted about it on Twitter, I'm like, oh god, everyone's still reading that damn book. I better finish it too.
00:01:20 And then it was said that we do a podcast today and I was told that we might get a new member of the procrastinators and I had to put a stop to that.
00:01:29 Because every time we have a guest on the show, he becomes a real procrastinator. That's how I ended up with Mumkey in the first place.
00:01:37 So no more new procrastinators. I had to put a stop to it. I said, god damn it, if it'll stop someone else from being on this podcast, I will read the book tonight.
00:01:45 Well now we're going to start all these rumors. We might as well save who this mystery man was who we wanted to prevent from joining the show.
00:01:52 It was our good friend and horrible collaborator, the mysterious rhinoceros.
00:01:56 He'll never be a real member.
00:01:58 There but for the grace of god. There but for the grace of god goes a new addition to our merry brood.
00:02:02 So I stayed up all night reading the book. I pulled a Mario Quintanilla only instead of teaching I was learning.
00:02:09 We should say that Tom wanted to be here but he's out of town right now so he couldn't.
00:02:14 That's true. In all fairness, he's the one who read it before any of us.
00:02:18 Not before me. What the fuck are you talking about? I read it first.
00:02:22 Oh shit, you're right. I totally forgot because you don't matter.
00:02:25 But Tom's the first real person. He's the first real person who read it.
00:02:29 So we're all up to speed. We've all fucking read this book and we've got the author here.
00:02:33 So let's just dive the fuck in.
00:02:36 I don't know. Should we just talk about our general thoughts on having finished it?
00:02:41 I've certainly got some strong feelings.
00:02:44 Why don't you go ahead since you're like swimming at the fucking...
00:02:47 You were remarkably affected by it it seems on Twitter.
00:02:51 Real quick before you start, I do want to say that since I was a young boy,
00:02:56 my dream of being an author was to like go on book tours and shit.
00:02:59 But now just sitting in my bedroom with three of my friends online,
00:03:04 my stomach is in knots and I feel physically ill.
00:03:07 So maybe I don't have what it takes to go on a book tour with all these fucking people.
00:03:12 Well, that's what Maddox was like during his first book tour as I remember in some interview.
00:03:16 But then he became the God we all know today. So don't worry about it.
00:03:19 It's all part of the growing process.
00:03:21 As long as my fall from grace is 15 years out, I think I'll be fine.
00:03:26 You know what? In all fairness, I should say,
00:03:28 Monkey, is there any sort of preamble you want to give?
00:03:31 Anything we should say before diving into it just since you're the main man?
00:03:36 I mean, I guess I'll just say we're going to go into heavy spoilers probably,
00:03:40 but really that shouldn't bother you too much.
00:03:43 And if you've already read it, then you should especially enjoy the podcast.
00:03:47 And yeah, I'd say if you can, I'd say go read it before listening to this.
00:03:50 If you can, go buy it and then read it and then come listen to this in that order.
00:03:54 That would be best. But if you want to listen, hey,
00:03:56 you're going to get some interesting shit out of this anyway.
00:03:59 So right off the bat, it's very interesting the way that you've structured the book.
00:04:06 I'm just going with the super basic details here,
00:04:08 but the way that you structured it from the perspective of multiple different protagonists,
00:04:12 they all count as protagonists, right?
00:04:14 Is that accurate? Is that the book lingo to use here?
00:04:16 Whatever, it doesn't matter.
00:04:17 The point is you've got Don, you've got Mason,
00:04:21 and you've got Mario as the main guys who are speaking here.
00:04:24 So you've got Mario, the school shooter,
00:04:26 Don, the sociopathic manipulator evil character,
00:04:30 and Mason, kind of the didn't do nothing good guy.
00:04:33 Ganky.
00:04:34 Sorry about that.
00:04:36 Yeah, you should be sorry. This is professional work we're doing here.
00:04:39 So, I mean, immediately, it took a while for me to figure out
00:04:43 kind of what Don's character was going to play into.
00:04:46 She's kind of like the main driver of everything that happens in the story,
00:04:49 for the most part, except obviously some shit goes down with Mario.
00:04:54 I mean, the book begins with we know he's the shooter,
00:04:57 so it's not like that's a spoiler or anything.
00:04:59 We know he's doing the shooting, it's just building up to that point.
00:05:02 And so it's kind of learning backwards how things got to that point,
00:05:06 and really what Mario might have done it regardless of what happened.
00:05:11 In fact, he probably would have, but it's the way that Don manipulates him
00:05:15 and encourages him and makes things worse for him
00:05:17 when it was entirely possible that things could have gone better.
00:05:20 I have a gigantic written-up analysis of Don's character here
00:05:25 in this notepad document that I wrote while we were waiting to get together here,
00:05:30 just going into specifically the ending and why she is writing,
00:05:34 because for her part, Don's input in the story is from the perspective
00:05:38 of a letter written to her mother after all the shit has gone down.
00:05:42 And so I put together this whole big analysis of like,
00:05:45 okay, so Don is a sociopath who manipulated all these people in the triflers
00:05:51 into doing some fucked up shit.
00:05:54 But it's very interesting because every account that we've got here
00:05:57 is in the form of sort of a journal entry or Mario's manifesto,
00:06:02 or in Don's case, it's that letter written to her mother.
00:06:05 But the thing is that we learn at the very end of the fucking book
00:06:09 is that her letter was written, and I actually suspected this from the very beginning,
00:06:13 Don's letter was written with an agenda.
00:06:15 It's full of at least several notable lies, and it's possible the entire thing was a lie.
00:06:21 So just for example, because Don's one of the characters that I am the most fascinated by.
00:06:27 I kind of relate to Mason the most, of course, as I'm sure everybody does.
00:06:31 And do you relate more to Mario?
00:06:35 I mean, I don't know if I relate to any of the characters in the story in the slightest.
00:06:41 Mason's a totally normal kid, except for the fact that he's got severe depression.
00:06:44 The one who I felt like I understood the most was probably Don,
00:06:50 though because of the twist at the end, it's hard to say,
00:06:55 because it's hard to say how much of what she portrays about herself is actually what she's like.
00:07:01 The character that's portrayed in her story felt like someone I went to high school with,
00:07:08 but a more clever and more sociopathic version of that person.
00:07:13 But seeing the big twist at the end kind of puts it into this perspective
00:07:18 where she has to be a lot smarter than the character she portrays.
00:07:22 Because I think that the character that I was reading out of Don,
00:07:28 some of the stuff she would focus on in her letter is like,
00:07:31 you have to be a fucking retard or some kind of weird autist to focus on these things.
00:07:37 But then you see at the end, well, okay, if it's all for a purpose,
00:07:40 then maybe she was doing that just to fuck with people.
00:07:43 Well, see, it's interesting, and I could tell that what Munky was going for
00:07:46 was trying to make Don, at least in her own eyes,
00:07:49 seem like she's the smartest dude ever and that she's got all her bases covered.
00:07:53 But I actually made a list of all the ways that she is weak and has made mistakes
00:07:59 and all her failings.
00:08:00 A categorical spreadsheet of her failings.
00:08:03 I did, because I have great hope at the end of the book
00:08:07 that Don is not nearly as smart as she thinks she is.
00:08:11 If the story that she wrote is mostly true,
00:08:19 then she definitely is not as smart as she thinks she is.
00:08:22 Well, I'm aware that it's entirely possible.
00:08:24 Literally everything she wrote was a lie or fabricated,
00:08:27 which I found very interesting,
00:08:28 and I suspected that from the beginning when she insisted that everything is 100% true
00:08:33 because nobody ever is, I don't know,
00:08:36 she's too smart to realize that she isn't coloring things with her own bias.
00:08:39 So that stands out to me immediately as something notable.
00:08:44 So at the end, when she has the big bait and switch where Truman,
00:08:51 probably the worst character in the book in terms of the worst person,
00:08:55 the worst person, because he's just such a weak, disgusting piece of shit,
00:08:58 possibly even worse than Don.
00:09:00 I will say, you don't really hear from him until the very end
00:09:05 where we get some parts from his perspective.
00:09:08 And I loved his character once we did just because he...
00:09:14 I think of all the characters in the story,
00:09:17 the one that you did the best job capturing is the semi-retarded beta male orbiter.
00:09:23 He was perfect as that.
00:09:26 I actually have some criticisms there.
00:09:28 I thought it went a little too far.
00:09:30 Like the childish writing, the spelling mistakes,
00:09:33 he seemed like he was literally retarded.
00:09:35 That's the thing, he probably is literally retarded.
00:09:38 Wait, isn't that the whole point of the book is that every character is literally massively retarded?
00:09:44 Well, there are plenty of mental illnesses to go around,
00:09:47 but I think only Truman descends into actual much dumber than the average person.
00:09:52 The thing about this book is that all the characters really did remind me of people I knew in high school.
00:09:58 And him especially.
00:10:01 I had a face I could put to that guy.
00:10:04 Yeah, I read Truman's lines, I see Jesse Wood's face.
00:10:08 It's just a one-to-one correlation.
00:10:12 Bam, got him.
00:10:14 You got me.
00:10:18 Bury me with my money.
00:10:22 But that aside, at the end,
00:10:25 as soon as the shit went down,
00:10:28 we're going all over the place here,
00:10:30 so eventually we'll probably flesh out the plot more.
00:10:33 But at the end, after Mario has gone off to do his shooting spree,
00:10:37 and Dawn has kind of,
00:10:41 she's gathered the trifles the day afterward for a meeting,
00:10:44 the way she is described,
00:10:46 and this is why I'll go through my list,
00:10:48 but this is one of the many ways I don't think she's as smart as she pretends to be.
00:10:52 Or she thinks she is.
00:10:54 Because according to her letter,
00:10:57 the day after a school shooting,
00:11:00 Chao's uncle, Tao,
00:11:03 brings home a fucking dude for them to do their evil human experiments on.
00:11:07 And it's like, how could he possibly think that was a good idea?
00:11:11 And of course, it's all a cover for smuggling out Truman
00:11:14 and explaining how people died,
00:11:16 and not pretending that it wasn't her.
00:11:18 I mean, it's, yes.
00:11:20 Yeah, I remember Digi pointed out almost immediately
00:11:23 when I went to his house the first time,
00:11:25 like, that's just the plot of a Serbian film.
00:11:27 Dawn is clearly writing out the plot of a Serbian film,
00:11:29 because it's even the same name as the character.
00:11:31 Yeah, the guy who he captures
00:11:33 is literally the main character of a Serbian film.
00:11:37 Like, it's literally that character
00:11:40 is written into her story.
00:11:42 So she has, like,
00:11:44 that's why I'm inclined to believe
00:11:46 that that's the only part of the story
00:11:48 that's like an outright lie,
00:11:50 because of the fact that she's basically
00:11:52 just borrowing from a movie she saw,
00:11:54 like, you know,
00:11:56 it's just so blatant that, like,
00:11:58 which leads me to believe that, yeah,
00:12:00 she's not as smart as she thinks she is,
00:12:02 because this one little chunk of story
00:12:04 is so incongruous with everything else
00:12:06 that sounds realistic,
00:12:08 and then this part just sounds completely batshit-insane,
00:12:10 and also it's named after a movie character,
00:12:12 which surely the police could figure out
00:12:14 before too very long.
00:12:16 And that's totally in character with her,
00:12:18 because at the end, we see that in her notes,
00:12:20 she's thinking of just naming herself after Lily,
00:12:22 which is Mason's little sister,
00:12:24 so obviously she is just pulling names
00:12:26 for things she knows for all kinds of stuff,
00:12:28 so totally, totally consistent with
00:12:30 the shit that she does.
00:12:32 Yeah, fuck Don.
00:12:34 You know, just for the sake of clarification,
00:12:36 so Don is basically the ringleader
00:12:38 of the triflers,
00:12:40 and as the story progresses,
00:12:42 she makes it quite clear,
00:12:44 who's goal in life is to
00:12:46 not really go out of her way to hurt people,
00:12:48 but what she's going to do with her life
00:12:50 is perform a human experimentation,
00:12:52 like the Nazis,
00:12:54 and sort of test the limits of
00:12:56 human pain endurance,
00:12:58 and what they'll do before they accept death,
00:13:00 and just all that kind of stuff
00:13:02 that's not particularly useful,
00:13:04 but she's very interested in,
00:13:06 and she spells it out quite clearly,
00:13:08 that there's no moral implication to it.
00:13:10 She doesn't give a fuck if she's hurting people.
00:13:12 And we'll do whatever it takes to get there.
00:13:14 So she kind of harangues the whole
00:13:16 all the triflers. She gets rid of
00:13:18 guys like Mason, who are a moral impediment,
00:13:20 who would stop her through,
00:13:22 and that process of doing that
00:13:24 was to me, by far,
00:13:26 the most disturbing part of the entire
00:13:28 book, but like way worse
00:13:30 than human experimentation, kind of because
00:13:32 I mean, maybe it's just me being selfish,
00:13:34 but whole like, kidnapping people,
00:13:36 chopping them up, making them kill themselves,
00:13:38 that kind of stuff, that almost seems
00:13:40 cartoonish to me, whereas
00:13:42 women, you know,
00:13:44 false rape allegations, doing the kind
00:13:46 of things that she's done, I could totally
00:13:48 see happen, probably happen every single
00:13:50 day, ruin innocent men's lives,
00:13:52 and terrified me to my core
00:13:54 that it could someday happen to me. So
00:13:56 I'm totally, you should have seen me on the plane
00:13:58 as I'm reading this book, surrounded by a grandma
00:14:00 and some, and some
00:14:02 some hot little number on my other side
00:14:04 as I'm just, my face is going,
00:14:06 ugh!
00:14:08 Sitting on the plane
00:14:10 raping this grandma, thinking, oh, I hope
00:14:12 she doesn't falsely accuse me.
00:14:16 Exactly, exactly.
00:14:18 Yeah, I mean, that part of the book had the most impact
00:14:20 by far, not only because it
00:14:22 felt more real, but also just
00:14:24 it was such a perfect
00:14:26 like, because the thing is, to me
00:14:28 at that point in the book was
00:14:30 where I was starting to get bored
00:14:32 and particularly
00:14:34 of Mason, because Mason's
00:14:36 thing is that he's kind of a normie.
00:14:38 Like, he's not a normie
00:14:40 normie, and this is another character
00:14:42 again, while I don't connect with
00:14:44 Mason personally at all, he was another one
00:14:46 I could put a face to from my high school
00:14:48 years, because like, there was always
00:14:50 like, that guy who hangs out
00:14:52 with kind of the freaks and weird...
00:14:54 And that face is the face of Davoo.
00:14:56 Not at all.
00:14:58 And of course, Mario would be monkey,
00:15:00 of course, of course. Yeah.
00:15:02 Well, I imagine Mario looking like
00:15:04 a munchie, actually.
00:15:06 Wait, that cut out, looking like who?
00:15:08 Like munchie, but like a short
00:15:10 version of munchie.
00:15:12 Half Mexican, yeah, it's the whole thing.
00:15:14 But anyways,
00:15:16 Mason, you know,
00:15:18 I knew kids in high school who kind of like
00:15:20 hung out with the freaks and weirdos
00:15:22 because their life wasn't really
00:15:24 like, normal, but
00:15:26 it's not that they thought the same way.
00:15:28 You know, like, Mason doesn't have
00:15:30 any like, mental disorders,
00:15:32 he just has a shitty home life.
00:15:34 So like, he connects with these people
00:15:36 who are much weirder than him
00:15:38 because he doesn't feel normal
00:15:40 because his home life is so shitty,
00:15:42 but like, the way he actually acts
00:15:44 is not like these other people who are all like,
00:15:46 you know, actually crazy.
00:15:48 But like, as you go through,
00:15:50 I kind of got that point, at first,
00:15:52 like learning about his home life and stuff, I was like, okay,
00:15:54 you know, I've seen this story before.
00:15:56 I know people who've been through this.
00:15:58 But that was the point of the character.
00:16:00 Eventually, though, it kind of starts to get to like,
00:16:02 okay, I get Mason,
00:16:04 because he doesn't really have a goal
00:16:06 the way that Mario and Don do.
00:16:08 Just by the end, baby!
00:16:10 Yeah, well, that's the thing.
00:16:12 At some point, I'm like, okay, I'm kind of sick of hearing
00:16:14 from Mason, and it's right as I'm starting
00:16:16 to really get sick of him,
00:16:18 that the tables turn on him,
00:16:20 and he gets written out in a big way.
00:16:22 And like, the second that thing happened
00:16:24 where they say like, the police go to pick him up,
00:16:26 I immediately flipped through the rest of the book
00:16:28 to see if Mason's name was at the top anymore,
00:16:30 and I saw that it wasn't, and I was like,
00:16:32 fuck!
00:16:34 Just that realization that his story
00:16:36 has just ended, like,
00:16:38 75% of the way through the book
00:16:40 was probably my favorite moment in the whole book.
00:16:42 It was by far the best.
00:16:44 Most disturbing, terrifies me to my core.
00:16:46 Yeah, that's the real shit.
00:16:48 Turn your fucking audio down.
00:16:50 Well, let's see here.
00:16:52 You know, if you like, I would love
00:16:54 to go through all the reasons why I think
00:16:56 Dawn is a piece of shit retard, faggot bitch.
00:16:58 By all means.
00:17:00 Okay, just dwell on that for a moment.
00:17:02 Okay, so I wrote this down,
00:17:04 so forgive me if I'm just reading off my page here.
00:17:06 The content of her letter.
00:17:08 What utility is served by Dawn
00:17:10 sending the letter? Why would she do it?
00:17:12 Ego and nothing more. She's still human
00:17:14 and has weaknesses. Now, I'm aware
00:17:16 of the list that is composed
00:17:18 by Truman.
00:17:20 There are exactly four reasons given
00:17:22 to why she would do it.
00:17:24 I divide them into two categories.
00:17:26 One, emotional reasons
00:17:28 that add risk to her doing so
00:17:30 and add nothing other
00:17:32 than fulfilling her own ego.
00:17:34 And those are freeing Mason
00:17:36 and taking credit for the Ricardo Fire.
00:17:38 Why in the fuck would Dawn do
00:17:40 something that in any way
00:17:42 makes her life more risky
00:17:44 just to help Mason? It doesn't make sense.
00:17:46 But putting that aside, there's also
00:17:48 two good reasons to do it.
00:17:50 I thought it was being implied,
00:17:52 especially through Truman's dialogue at the end of the book,
00:17:54 that Dawn actually did like
00:17:56 Mason. Like, she's actually
00:17:58 in love with him, I thought.
00:18:00 Unacceptable. There's no way that this...
00:18:02 If she loved him, she... Okay, I mean
00:18:04 that is unfathomable to me.
00:18:06 Any feeling she has
00:18:08 cannot be equated to love.
00:18:10 I think she lied
00:18:12 about the sex being terrible
00:18:14 and that she actually had
00:18:16 a thing for him. Because Truman's getting...
00:18:18 Truman keeps saying how
00:18:20 she'll get like...
00:18:22 Oh, she's getting way into writing
00:18:24 about him or that she's ignoring Truman
00:18:26 and stuff. Truman who she's obviously using
00:18:28 and doesn't give a fuck about.
00:18:30 Here's where the black pills come out
00:18:32 because love isn't a real thing.
00:18:34 Especially... What does that have
00:18:36 anything to do with...
00:18:38 You're saying that she likes him.
00:18:40 What does it mean to like someone?
00:18:42 To be willing to frame them for rape
00:18:44 of you or her little sister
00:18:46 or his little sister and send them to jail?
00:18:48 She needed to do that to get out of
00:18:50 what she... She needed to get him out of the way
00:18:52 but then she still cares about him
00:18:54 enough to free him.
00:18:56 That seemed obvious to me.
00:18:58 Mumki, do you want to pitch in on this?
00:19:00 Do you have an opinion?
00:19:02 I mean, of course I do have an opinion
00:19:04 because I know what happens
00:19:06 but I don't like to
00:19:08 answer questions in terms of
00:19:10 people trying to like
00:19:12 translate the book or interpretations
00:19:14 because it ruins people's
00:19:16 interpretations so I'd rather sit out on that one.
00:19:18 That's fair.
00:19:20 Well, okay, I guess we'll just have to have a disagreement there
00:19:22 but I don't see how you could possibly claim.
00:19:24 Was either of those an interpretation that you had not even thought of though?
00:19:26 Like...
00:19:28 Is the possibility that Don
00:19:30 is in love with him intentionally
00:19:32 written into the book as a possibility?
00:19:34 Even Al can see there's a possibility.
00:19:36 I just find it ridiculous.
00:19:38 Because I think a lot of the last part
00:19:40 of the book is clearly
00:19:42 throwing in lots and lots of implications
00:19:44 so that you can come to different conclusions
00:19:46 but without it being
00:19:48 ever, you know.
00:19:50 Like, how much of the stories lie,
00:19:52 how much of this and that. There's deliberately no answer
00:19:54 but there's lots and lots of implications
00:19:56 that could drag you in different directions
00:19:58 and I just thought there was a lot of implications suggesting
00:20:00 especially in what Truman was saying
00:20:02 about Don writing the letter
00:20:04 that she is in love with Mason
00:20:06 and won't admit it because she's too proud.
00:20:08 What...
00:20:10 Okay, here's the thing though. I literally don't care
00:20:12 about the answer to that question.
00:20:14 Whatever her feelings are
00:20:16 we're done with her feelings.
00:20:18 Her feelings don't matter anymore.
00:20:20 Not interested. She has done these things
00:20:22 I'm just trying to explain that this is why
00:20:24 I mean I'm not saying it was a good idea
00:20:26 for her to...
00:20:28 What's the relevance here?
00:20:30 I'm saying this is why she incriminated herself.
00:20:32 It's not that it was a good idea to do so
00:20:34 but she wanted to get him off the hook
00:20:36 because they're already after her.
00:20:38 That's fine.
00:20:40 She's not as the bad guy
00:20:42 but so why not just stack the extra allegations
00:20:44 on herself and let Jason skate
00:20:46 if she likes...the Mason skate if she likes him.
00:20:48 Well that's fine but she is now
00:20:50 unleashed what she must have known
00:20:52 would be at the very least a vindictive agent
00:20:54 someone who's not going to be too thrilled
00:20:56 about the shit that just went down.
00:20:58 I don't think she's smart enough
00:21:00 to realize that he would like
00:21:02 become a fucking...
00:21:04 Vigilante hero, man.
00:21:06 Exactly.
00:21:08 Yeah okay maybe
00:21:10 but see that's exactly what I wanted to get to.
00:21:12 In this way Don has shown that she is weak
00:21:14 and that she has flaws
00:21:16 and that she is not an impenetrable
00:21:18 logical fortress. I mean that's obvious.
00:21:20 She has these kind of flaws.
00:21:22 It just gives me hope.
00:21:24 It just makes me happy about the ending
00:21:26 because we've got, I forget what the guy's name was,
00:21:28 Grimes, the crime guy.
00:21:30 The true hero of the book, the only character
00:21:32 who I found remotely relatable
00:21:34 especially is Ron Clacker
00:21:36 who's going to bring justice to the world.
00:21:38 He has a lust for justice.
00:21:40 He's going to take her down
00:21:42 in the sequel written by me.
00:21:46 I can't wait, I can't wait.
00:21:48 I actually would kind of love
00:21:50 a trifle sequel written by Jesse
00:21:52 about like Mason and that agent
00:21:54 trying to take down Don.
00:21:56 He teams up with Truman Sinclair
00:21:58 who was the real mastermind all along.
00:22:00 He was playing that bitch for a fool the whole time.
00:22:02 Now he's just using her.
00:22:04 Now he's got this hot blonde girlfriend.
00:22:06 He just wanted her to be blonde the whole book.
00:22:08 That was the whole plan.
00:22:10 That was the gambit.
00:22:12 He's portraying himself like a humble beta orbiter
00:22:14 but in truth he's the fucking Omega male.
00:22:16 It's all part of his
00:22:18 Machiavellian schemes
00:22:20 to slam that plus.
00:22:22 When a beta goes that beta
00:22:24 it goes all the way to Omega. His power
00:22:26 circles around and becomes infinite.
00:22:28 My god, yes.
00:22:30 It's kind of like retard strength only socially applied.
00:22:32 Same kind of shit there.
00:22:38 I read the ending as
00:22:40 personally I don't feel I need a sequel at all
00:22:42 because in my mind I now know
00:22:44 that it was clear all along
00:22:46 but I know that Don has flaws
00:22:48 and that there are two hot
00:22:50 male heroes on the case
00:22:52 to take down this weak
00:22:54 cowardly woman. And if Ronda Rousey
00:22:56 can't take Jesse
00:22:58 then we know
00:23:00 that Don cannot handle these two men.
00:23:02 Two men.
00:23:04 I would kick Don Bracken's ass.
00:23:06 She's like a 15 year old girl.
00:23:08 I'd throw her in the fucking toilet.
00:23:12 So yeah, I mean
00:23:14 my impression of Don throughout the story
00:23:16 is that the way she's meant to be
00:23:18 is just extremely pretentious.
00:23:20 Like she really thinks she's hot shit
00:23:22 but it's constantly evidence
00:23:24 that she is not.
00:23:26 Not just in her actions
00:23:28 that she's petty and retarded.
00:23:30 Because she's a fucking teenager
00:23:32 and she acts like a teenager.
00:23:34 The things that she thinks are a big deal
00:23:36 are just not.
00:23:38 She's so obsessed with those swearing.
00:23:40 And I knew girls like that in high school.
00:23:42 I knew people who were like
00:23:44 swearing is for
00:23:46 uneducated people.
00:23:48 I know that kind of pretentious bitch
00:23:50 and she totally reminded me of that.
00:23:52 So the whole book I always saw her as
00:23:54 this grating pretentious asshole
00:23:56 who was just
00:23:58 who thought she was hot shit
00:24:00 and the only reason that she succeeds
00:24:02 is that everyone around her is even more retarded.
00:24:04 That's right.
00:24:06 In that moment when she meets
00:24:08 the detectives
00:24:10 you definitely have this sense of
00:24:12 these people are fucking adults
00:24:14 and they're way beyond her
00:24:16 and they're going to
00:24:18 there's gonna be a way
00:24:20 they can get her.
00:24:22 The end of the book doesn't really leave her
00:24:24 in the context of winning this one.
00:24:28 She's got all these things she's trying to do
00:24:30 while she's on the escape
00:24:32 but none of it is very convincing
00:24:34 that it's gonna work out for much longer.
00:24:36 They've figured out
00:24:38 who she is.
00:24:40 They're gonna chase her down. It can't be that hard
00:24:42 to catch this girl
00:24:44 who has no fucking idea what she's doing.
00:24:46 She thinks she does but she's a fucking idiot.
00:24:48 That's what I love so much about her.
00:24:50 The fact that she...
00:24:52 Just to go back on that
00:24:54 because I love shitting on this fucking bitch
00:24:56 as I'm sure everyone does
00:24:58 she just represents everything evil.
00:25:00 Forgive me for getting a little redpilled here
00:25:02 but she's like evil femininity at its worst
00:25:04 or at least she uses the tools at her disposal
00:25:06 particularly with Mason
00:25:08 and manipulating Truman
00:25:10 and the whole fucking thing there.
00:25:14 The way that she's so
00:25:16 cataclysmically does not
00:25:18 understand Mario
00:25:20 does not know that one of her pawns
00:25:22 is about to go commit a fucking
00:25:24 school shooting tomorrow.
00:25:26 That's how you know she...
00:25:28 She sees herself as in control
00:25:30 but she does this thing
00:25:32 and this I can relate to
00:25:34 because I kind of do the same thing
00:25:36 which is that when things
00:25:38 don't go your way at all
00:25:40 you just reframe it as though
00:25:42 but she does that
00:25:44 so much that it's obvious
00:25:46 that she doesn't really have any control.
00:25:48 She finds out that Mario's doing this thing
00:25:50 and she's like oh well
00:25:52 okay that's fine
00:25:54 I can plan...
00:25:56 it's actually like this
00:25:58 this all works out.
00:26:00 This is exactly what I had in mind
00:26:02 this is okay
00:26:04 but the reality is that her plans are completely fucked
00:26:06 and that she's getting foiled left and right
00:26:08 and having to change everything
00:26:10 and you can do that for some time
00:26:12 but how long before
00:26:14 it just pulls
00:26:16 the rug gets pulled out from under her
00:26:18 This bitch didn't even think
00:26:20 she was so
00:26:22 fucking dense. She didn't even realize
00:26:24 that Joe was in the restaurant before the thing got burned down
00:26:26 didn't have any idea
00:26:28 that there was a possibility that somebody would be there
00:26:30 and that's just one of her many
00:26:32 many mistakes along the way
00:26:34 and yeah she doesn't know what the fuck's going on
00:26:36 Well you know we're talking about
00:26:38 what a monster Don is
00:26:40 but we're not talking about
00:26:42 the other actual monster in the book
00:26:44 that committed the shooting
00:26:46 Mario who is
00:26:48 just as much if not more of a retarded faggot
00:26:50 and represents everything wrong with the
00:26:52 entire world all at once
00:26:54 he's a stupid
00:26:56 like uncreative, unoriginal
00:26:58 he only speaks in like
00:27:00 4chan copy pastas
00:27:02 which...
00:27:04 I'm not sure
00:27:06 he just speaks in
00:27:08 monkey videos
00:27:10 is what I'm trying to say
00:27:12 two of my videos are just
00:27:14 direct cold from Mario
00:27:16 I recognize a few passages
00:27:18 of just being your videos
00:27:20 well you know if we're segwaying from Don
00:27:22 he's basically a mumkey jones fan
00:27:24 is what he is
00:27:26 he's mumkey's entire fan base
00:27:28 in one wretched body
00:27:30 well you know the thing is
00:27:32 even though I'm fascinated by Don
00:27:34 the great thing about that is
00:27:36 the reason I even wanted to do this
00:27:38 and I was tweeting about this before
00:27:40 Don is pure evil and is basically
00:27:42 irredeemable by her own account
00:27:44 maybe she's
00:27:46 talking herself up, she's not actually sociopath
00:27:48 but according to her account
00:27:50 she's not changed anytime soon
00:27:52 she is a constant evil force
00:27:54 Mario on the other hand
00:27:56 that's something we can do something about
00:27:58 Mario is someone who could have been saved
00:28:00 by society
00:28:02 well stick with me
00:28:04 I'm just saying that
00:28:06 Don frames herself as like
00:28:08 in the end of the book she talks about how
00:28:10 there's a passage about how
00:28:12 what were the trifle is, what makes a trifle
00:28:14 or a trifle and she thinks about
00:28:16 oh were they all lonely, did they all have the same fascination with the macabre
00:28:18 no it wasn't any of those things
00:28:20 it's just that they were manipulable by me
00:28:22 and I agree that that was the real problem here
00:28:24 these people had psychological
00:28:26 vulnerabilities that she exploited
00:28:28 and so the way we can help that
00:28:30 and we can talk about Mario specifically
00:28:32 cause he's obviously the biggest one
00:28:34 though Truman's no spring chicken either
00:28:36 the murderer himself
00:28:38 yeah like that's what opened them up to this shit
00:28:40 to being able to be manipulated
00:28:42 by things that we cannot change
00:28:44 we cannot change what's going on inside Don's head
00:28:46 she's always going to be evil
00:28:48 but we can help with guys like Mario
00:28:50 and if he just had had some fucking friends
00:28:52 he wouldn't have done this shit
00:28:54 and you know like I rewatched
00:28:56 Mumkey's um
00:28:58 Elliot Roger, notice I didn't say Rogers
00:29:00 Elliot Roger, I'm learning
00:29:02 I'm getting better
00:29:04 I watched that video beforehand
00:29:06 and it was the two questions
00:29:08 that he brought up at the beginning of that
00:29:10 why did this happen
00:29:12 and how can we prevent it in the future
00:29:14 yes that's pretty much what was running through my mind
00:29:16 the whole time thinking about Mario
00:29:18 well obviously Mario is based on Elliot Roger
00:29:20 and so you know
00:29:22 the parallel is obvious
00:29:24 what were you saying Jesse
00:29:26 well like Mario doesn't have any
00:29:28 real problems
00:29:30 all of his sadness
00:29:32 and depression comes from the fact that he is
00:29:34 an obnoxious little spurred idiot
00:29:36 shit retarded butt boy
00:29:38 who can't make any friends
00:29:40 because he sucks that's no one else's fault
00:29:42 true I mean
00:29:44 I think it's um unrealistic
00:29:46 to say like how do we help these people
00:29:48 oh we gotta we gotta go we gotta
00:29:50 find the weird little depressed people
00:29:52 who are mean to everyone and who suck and just be friends with them
00:29:54 so they'll be better that's ridiculous
00:29:56 some people just suck and they're evil
00:29:58 well even if
00:30:00 the answer is that we can't do anything
00:30:02 about it until we have some sort of
00:30:04 I don't know brain scanning
00:30:06 psychopath technology and then we can know
00:30:08 ahead of time what people are gonna do
00:30:10 I would just like to know if there's
00:30:12 anything we can do
00:30:14 and you know you're right you're right
00:30:16 because especially the way Don frames it
00:30:18 I love the way in this book the way
00:30:20 there are different accountings
00:30:22 of different events and that the way like Don
00:30:24 I love how Mario goes into detail
00:30:26 about like all the conversations he had
00:30:28 with Don about like oh how I want to like
00:30:30 massacre everyone in the school and Don was totally like
00:30:32 yeah I want to fucking you know hang him up
00:30:34 by meat hooks and carve out their innards
00:30:36 or whatever it was but Don leaves that out of
00:30:38 her story entirely yeah clearly framing
00:30:40 herself as like oh I would never
00:30:42 delve into that kind of like bullshit
00:30:44 I fucking love that that's that's that's
00:30:46 really great she's a pretentious bitch and Mario's
00:30:48 Mario has no reason to be he's
00:30:50 completely Mario is just as pretentious
00:30:52 and deluded I mean he has these fantasies
00:30:54 that he's going to kill a bunch of people
00:30:56 and all the betas will be alphas
00:30:58 now and no one will ever be depressed again
00:31:00 he's going to create a utopia I mean like
00:31:02 where do you even start with
00:31:04 what could fix that nothing can fix
00:31:06 that that's a that's a deep fucked up
00:31:08 idiot delusion yeah
00:31:10 well that's what I
00:31:12 you're not wrong personally like Mario's parts
00:31:14 are my favorite parts of the book because
00:31:16 they're hilarious like nothing causes
00:31:18 something like that that's just there's something fucking wrong
00:31:20 with you go to you belong in the trash
00:31:22 yeah I we that's not
00:31:24 good enough damn it that's good enough
00:31:26 I kind of
00:31:28 I kind of agree with
00:31:30 Jesse because like we wouldn't know
00:31:32 like a guy like this
00:31:34 it's like like Jesse just said
00:31:36 we can't just like find a depressed guy
00:31:38 be like I'm going to be your best friend
00:31:40 we've been at antidepressants
00:31:42 and you can debate about
00:31:44 you know the ethics or the
00:31:46 value of antidepressants but they don't
00:31:48 make an antidepressant for stupid there's no
00:31:50 anti-stupid look look it's like
00:31:52 but but he clearly
00:31:54 illustrates several
00:31:56 points in the story where I mean we're just going from
00:31:58 his words here obviously but there were ways
00:32:00 that things could get better Mario was never even
00:32:02 on medicine at any point there's
00:32:04 ways that things could have gone
00:32:06 differently but no one could
00:32:08 ever possibly recognize that
00:32:10 like there's no way you can know when the doctor
00:32:12 in the when Mario talks about how the doctor
00:32:14 just blew him off and didn't take him
00:32:16 seriously and said just go talk to your general
00:32:18 practitioner whatever yes Mario should have
00:32:20 followed up with that but there were
00:32:22 there were moments where things could
00:32:24 have gone differently if the system was
00:32:26 more you know like the system is always
00:32:28 imperfect and that's the the problem
00:32:30 with all this stuff is that they try to
00:32:32 fix them yeah well
00:32:34 but the thing is the problem
00:32:36 isn't that nobody helped Mario
00:32:38 the problem is that the system itself
00:32:40 needs fixing like it's
00:32:42 not that he needed fixing it's that the system
00:32:44 needs fixing is that you need to have the doctors
00:32:46 not be shit you know and stuff
00:32:48 like that I agree and so
00:32:50 yeah but
00:32:52 personally reading Mario's parts
00:32:54 if this is
00:32:56 my biggest criticism of this book
00:32:58 and this is something I told
00:33:00 to monkey but I tried to avoid talking about it
00:33:02 online so it wouldn't color anyone's perception
00:33:04 who hasn't read it yet
00:33:06 it's just the fact that
00:33:08 it slips into self-awareness
00:33:10 sometimes in ways
00:33:12 that I think work against the
00:33:14 characters because with Mario
00:33:16 sometimes he reads like a parody
00:33:18 of a school shooter
00:33:20 and sometimes he reads like a school shooter
00:33:22 and so
00:33:24 even though that makes this part of the book hilarious
00:33:26 at times it also
00:33:28 kind of deflates parts of it where
00:33:30 there's moments I love
00:33:32 like okay when he goes on and on about how Death Note
00:33:34 inspired him that was like
00:33:36 the perfect combination of hilarious
00:33:38 and also totally I could see it
00:33:40 but then there's other times where he
00:33:42 goes on a rant that yeah does sound
00:33:44 too much like a monkey
00:33:46 video but I know monkey videos
00:33:48 when I watch them I can tell it's self-aware
00:33:50 and it's not a fucking school shooter
00:33:52 writing it so when he
00:33:54 is able to have that level of cleverness
00:33:56 or to tell a funny joke
00:33:58 I think well
00:34:00 Elliot Roger couldn't tell a funny joke
00:34:02 Elliot Roger's fucking retarded
00:34:04 his book reads like an insane person
00:34:06 wrote it you know Mario
00:34:08 sometimes seems retarded sometimes
00:34:10 he seems too clever and so
00:34:12 when he comes down to the end where he just fucks everything up
00:34:14 and dies it's like this should
00:34:16 have been a more retarded character
00:34:18 I think you know
00:34:20 I mean I see
00:34:22 what you're saying I don't know if I
00:34:24 necessarily agree yeah there were
00:34:26 times where I thought
00:34:28 I don't think anybody who commits
00:34:30 a school shooting is a funny guy
00:34:32 because funny people have friends
00:34:34 and it won't happen
00:34:36 well but that's part of the delusion
00:34:38 what if the Joker committed a school shooting
00:34:40 the Joker
00:34:42 yeah I'd be all smiles
00:34:44 I don't know if the Joker is actually a funny guy
00:34:46 like
00:34:48 has the Joker ever actually said like
00:34:50 a joke that makes you laugh
00:34:52 I thought the Joker said what he finds funny
00:34:54 I would put Mark Hamill and Cesar Romero
00:34:56 in the funny category of jokers
00:34:58 but that we're getting off on a tangent about with jokers
00:35:00 rating the funniness of jokers
00:35:02 I feel that like the point of
00:35:04 the Joker is not so much that he's funny
00:35:06 to other people but that what he himself
00:35:08 finds to be funny is
00:35:10 you know
00:35:12 terrorism I guess whatever he does
00:35:14 what does he consider it
00:35:16 I think the Joker is a terrorist
00:35:18 I mean in the animated series
00:35:20 he's a crime lord but he's also a murderer
00:35:22 yeah all those things
00:35:24 all those good things
00:35:26 well uh yeah
00:35:28 alright that's fair you know I'm pretty good
00:35:30 at just diving into something
00:35:32 and this is probably a negative on myself as like a critic
00:35:34 I'm pretty easily able to get
00:35:36 absorbed in worlds I'm reading so there weren't
00:35:38 many times where I had difficulty
00:35:40 separating like the monkey
00:35:42 well I think it's I think it's the reason
00:35:44 I felt this way is because I felt
00:35:46 so strongly that these characters reminded me
00:35:48 of people that I've known
00:35:50 before that like when they did something
00:35:52 that was incongruous with that then it would
00:35:54 it would take me out of it a little like with
00:35:56 with Dawn because she's
00:35:58 so pretentious and so up her
00:36:00 own ass and focuses on so many
00:36:02 weird details in her story there were
00:36:04 times where I thought she was too clever
00:36:06 as well where like she does something that I'm
00:36:08 like okay I don't believe
00:36:10 that the person who thought that explaining
00:36:12 every fucking detail of her
00:36:14 work shift at the stupid goddamn ice cream
00:36:16 place was necessary is also
00:36:18 clever enough to write
00:36:20 this other sentence you know it's like can I
00:36:22 like like like monkey himself
00:36:24 is better at English
00:36:26 and in creative writing than
00:36:28 the characters that he's portraying
00:36:30 even though he sometimes is trying to portray
00:36:32 the story like
00:36:34 sometimes he tries to write like a retard
00:36:36 and sometimes he writes clever and
00:36:38 the two can compete is what I mean
00:36:40 to say you know I the only time
00:36:42 I really felt like that was with Truman I mean
00:36:44 unless I never got the sense this character was actually
00:36:46 retarded I definitely
00:36:48 for a loop got the sense that
00:36:50 um that that monkey had stumbled
00:36:52 upon a great scheme
00:36:54 of making his book impossible
00:36:56 to criticize because it's written from the
00:36:58 perspective of three terrible writers
00:37:00 yeah true true
00:37:02 but that's again that's what I
00:37:04 mean when I say that sometimes the writing was
00:37:06 too good like it's
00:37:08 it's just inconsistent where sometimes
00:37:10 it's like it's clever and
00:37:12 funny and it feels like a dark comedy which
00:37:14 is how it kind of builds itself and then at other
00:37:16 times it feels like you're just looking into
00:37:18 the like when again when Don goes into
00:37:20 like everything about her work routine it was so
00:37:22 fucking unnecessary and I thought that part
00:37:24 of the book was completely boring because
00:37:26 it it's not
00:37:28 it's not funny it's not
00:37:30 really relevant she's just going on
00:37:32 and on about everything they do
00:37:34 but it does get you kind of more into
00:37:36 like I'm looking at it and I'm thinking this
00:37:38 is what a fucking 16 year old would write though
00:37:40 like she would think that this is all
00:37:42 necessary because I've read lots of stuff
00:37:44 written by teenagers because people
00:37:46 teenagers constantly submit to me their
00:37:48 work for my review
00:37:50 and it's always full of unnecessary
00:37:52 bullshit information so reading a part
00:37:54 like that was more
00:37:56 boring as a story but better as
00:37:58 this is something a dumbass
00:38:00 16 year old pretentious bitch would write
00:38:02 whereas other parts where it's
00:38:04 like really you know there's like a clever twist
00:38:06 and there's like a just right timed
00:38:08 piece of dialogue or something that's really funny
00:38:10 I'm like okay that was great
00:38:12 oh what was the one I wanted to make them
00:38:14 look like you oh
00:38:16 got them fuck wheelchair
00:38:18 people oh yeah yeah that whole
00:38:20 big dramatic twist part
00:38:22 that was that was I died inside
00:38:24 really bad I wanted to die I definitely
00:38:26 felt I like how he put her
00:38:28 on the school shooting list by the way
00:38:30 like she did anything fucking wrong
00:38:32 fuck you Mario you piece of shit
00:38:34 alright what did Marissa do
00:38:36 what did she do she did
00:38:38 nothing she did nothing wrong
00:38:40 you're the bad person okay alright
00:38:42 go on yeah I definitely
00:38:44 um I felt far more
00:38:46 disturbed I guess you'd say
00:38:48 with Mario's chapters than with dawn's
00:38:50 chapters because
00:38:52 actual psychopaths like dawn
00:38:54 the job something
00:38:56 actual psychopaths like dawn are you know pretty far
00:38:58 and few and far between and
00:39:00 they're not as smart as they think they are and they usually
00:39:02 get caught but people like Mario
00:39:04 are fucking everywhere
00:39:06 um he is every
00:39:08 4-channer in the world he's every internet commenter
00:39:10 in the world and every redditor in the world
00:39:12 they're all over the place they're all
00:39:14 too stupid and deluded
00:39:16 to know how evil they are and how malicious
00:39:18 they are and they're the real
00:39:20 problem we need to take them out we need to put them
00:39:22 in a fucking meat grinder
00:39:24 just like you know Mondo Burger you mess with Kurt
00:39:26 you go in the grinder that's what I say
00:39:28 what the fuck is
00:39:30 Mondo Burger
00:39:32 is that the prequel to Good Burger
00:39:34 yeah it's the evil fast food chain
00:39:36 in Good Burger
00:39:38 that's right that's right
00:39:40 I haven't seen Good Burger in 15 years
00:39:42 can we just talk real quickly
00:39:44 about do you think it is
00:39:46 I was just wondering about this so nobody
00:39:48 at any point ever
00:39:50 like provided evidence
00:39:52 besides Dawn's written word
00:39:54 that there was actual like human
00:39:56 experimentation that happened in that basement
00:39:58 with like the first guy we know the second guy
00:40:00 was fake obviously but the first guy
00:40:02 I found myself re-evaluating
00:40:04 whether or not that was even true and if so
00:40:06 because this goes into like why
00:40:08 she even wrote this letter like why give them
00:40:10 all this material to like
00:40:12 look into the fact that yes I am a
00:40:14 super psychopathic monster
00:40:16 I want you to know about the fact that
00:40:18 I've committed these atrocities
00:40:20 like what good is served by that
00:40:22 other than just ego it was just ego
00:40:24 we can just write it off as we go
00:40:26 well that part is corroborated by Mario's part
00:40:28 I mean a lot of what Dawn says is
00:40:30 can be called true because
00:40:32 yeah Mario did say that they started doing that
00:40:34 he said something about that yeah
00:40:36 yeah the FBI even brings it up he says
00:40:38 Mario says he was responsible for two deaths
00:40:40 and blue bitty blue
00:40:42 oh shit that was two deaths
00:40:44 fuck okay yeah I fucked that up
00:40:46 incidentally I wonder about if
00:40:48 why the fuck did she tell anyone though
00:40:50 how many of the kids
00:40:52 videos had you guys seen
00:40:54 because I'd seen one man one jar before
00:40:56 so that was
00:40:58 another interesting aspect of the story
00:41:00 is how much of it is just real
00:41:02 well sometimes it's
00:41:04 interesting because some of them are monkey made up
00:41:06 and some of them are real videos
00:41:08 and it's because I've seen some of the real videos
00:41:10 that it actually enhanced
00:41:12 how disturbing the made up ones were
00:41:14 because like because I can't
00:41:16 tell I can't tell how many things I just
00:41:18 haven't seen before so as I was reading this
00:41:20 book probably the part that
00:41:22 disturbed me the most was just
00:41:24 monkey describing
00:41:26 video tapes that the characters were watching
00:41:28 that was extremely disturbing for sure
00:41:30 and again I could never tell which ones are real
00:41:32 and which ones aren't because there were so many
00:41:34 or at least a few
00:41:36 that I knew were real that I had seen
00:41:38 like one man one jar which is the one where the guy
00:41:40 puts a jar of bazaar and it breaks and he has to pull
00:41:42 all the shards out
00:41:44 fucking disgusting video
00:41:46 but like I've not seen that one
00:41:48 yeah it's on like porn
00:41:50 sites but
00:41:52 yeah it's
00:41:54 just knowing that that was real
00:41:56 and then thinking about like okay
00:41:58 well if that one's real then maybe this one's real
00:42:00 my mom just showed up with a bunch of food
00:42:02 and drinks you know what a bitch
00:42:04 I'm so sick of her one of these days I'm gonna kill her
00:42:06 and I'm gonna kill the whole world too
00:42:08 and make it a better place for
00:42:10 podcasters like me
00:42:12 that one moment where Don
00:42:14 describes you know Mario's mom
00:42:16 is just being such a nice lady that one time
00:42:18 really really added a lot
00:42:20 to when Mario just shows up to school with like her fucking
00:42:22 blood all over his hands
00:42:24 what did she do Mario did she deserve that is this justice
00:42:26 guess so
00:42:28 casualties of war I guess
00:42:30 it's kind of funny that Jesse made that joke because Jesse
00:42:32 does actually complain about his mom
00:42:34 all the time and I have met his
00:42:36 mom and she's an extremely sweet woman
00:42:38 so
00:42:40 that's why he hates Mario hit
00:42:42 too close to home hey Jesse
00:42:44 oh boy
00:42:46 like I remember
00:42:48 when you told me or you were on
00:42:50 some stream and you were saying that um
00:42:52 that uh that that boozy floozy
00:42:54 was like friends with your mom and I was like
00:42:56 huh I always thought Jesse's like
00:42:58 I imagined your mom is like I don't know
00:43:00 like a total bitch or something
00:43:02 and then I met her and I was like oh she's just like
00:43:04 a mid-western
00:43:06 house mom she's just a mom
00:43:08 yeah my mom
00:43:10 is a saint and I always feel bad when I complain
00:43:12 about her
00:43:14 yeah well that's good you see
00:43:16 shout out to Jesse's mom
00:43:18 and Jesse's mom yeah
00:43:20 and Jesse's whole household is nice I stayed there for a week
00:43:22 had a good time
00:43:24 aside from the shit rot that I caught
00:43:26 in the uh
00:43:28 baby Groot
00:43:30 baby Groot
00:43:32 the real hero of this book baby Groot
00:43:34 as he is the real hero of every book
00:43:36 ever written
00:43:38 uh yeah
00:43:40 he's gonna be a essential character in
00:43:42 my sequel it's gonna be a buddy
00:43:44 cop movie with uh special agent Dale Cooper
00:43:46 from Twin Peaks and baby Groot
00:43:48 and they're gonna take down Don
00:43:50 they're gonna trap her in the black lodge
00:43:52 where she belongs I gotta
00:43:54 watch the new Twin Peaks I just remembered about that
00:43:56 apparently it's shit so
00:43:58 oh no
00:44:00 have you been watching it Jess
00:44:02 I have been watching it
00:44:04 because Victor was just telling me
00:44:06 that he just marathoned all of the original
00:44:08 it's very
00:44:10 very slow and very methodical
00:44:12 and they're really taking their sweet time
00:44:14 with everything that you want to see but I wouldn't
00:44:16 call it bad
00:44:18 the people on the Twin Peaks
00:44:20 Reddit board are all of course kissing
00:44:22 every episode's ass and calling them a genius
00:44:24 I'm not like
00:44:26 I can see where they're coming from
00:44:28 I can also see where people would say it's boring
00:44:30 but I don't know I'm invested I like it
00:44:32 to be fair
00:44:34 I thought that the original series
00:44:36 has a lot of moments where it drags and gets
00:44:38 pretty boring I thought so too Victor said
00:44:40 he just like completely loved the
00:44:42 entire thing like both seasons
00:44:44 the whole franchise is something that you just
00:44:46 like you stick to the bad parts because the good
00:44:48 parts haven't of trying to make up for it
00:44:50 all right well now we're reviewing
00:44:52 like that we're on the Twin Peaks
00:44:54 all right we're off all right we're off that
00:44:56 now let's talk about
00:44:58 let's talk about Mason
00:45:00 just to see what we can get out of the character
00:45:02 of Mason so it was interesting to me
00:45:04 that you said did you that you couldn't really relate
00:45:06 to the guy because to me he was painted to be
00:45:08 basically the normal everyman
00:45:10 well I'm not a normal everyman am I
00:45:12 so well I wouldn't really consider
00:45:14 myself to be one either but just as like a moral
00:45:16 agent you know what's interesting actually
00:45:18 I would I would I actually love the character
00:45:20 of Dawn because Dawn is exactly
00:45:22 the opposite of me because while she is
00:45:24 an amoral unfeeling
00:45:26 psychopath wanting to hurt and kill people
00:45:28 I am an amoral
00:45:30 unfeeling psychopath whose only desire is to
00:45:32 make the world better for everyone that is what
00:45:34 I am this is my I don't
00:45:36 give a fuck who I have to crush on my way
00:45:38 to make their life great I will do
00:45:40 it and I will I will take hostages
00:45:42 I'll do whatever is necessary to make the world
00:45:44 better for everybody and
00:45:46 so and and you know Mason just as like
00:45:48 the maybe it's just
00:45:50 that my connection to him as like this guy
00:45:52 being you know strung along
00:45:54 by Dawn I don't know dude
00:45:56 this shit really gets to me any of this
00:45:58 kind of shit about an innocent guy
00:46:00 just being I
00:46:02 I know I'm gonna go off your red pill
00:46:04 migtown date we understand
00:46:06 I I I have such deep
00:46:08 fear of the of the real power
00:46:10 that women have socially over men and it
00:46:12 it haunts me it haunts me all the
00:46:14 time it doesn't you know why it doesn't haunt
00:46:16 me because I'm not a rapist
00:46:18 well that was
00:46:20 was he a rapist was he a rapist Jesse
00:46:22 yeah lock him up here's
00:46:24 an accusation no actual proof what's
00:46:26 that a bunch of hearsay throw him away
00:46:28 fucking lock him up I just fuck what do you
00:46:30 mean there's a little girl come all over
00:46:32 her that's proof that doesn't matter
00:46:34 if it's true or not it's still
00:46:36 she she she literally could have gone into
00:46:38 the bathroom after he jacked off and rubbed
00:46:40 it on herself there was no proof that he
00:46:42 ever do that that's ridiculous
00:46:44 that would never happen it would never
00:46:46 happen would never happen
00:46:48 incidentally by far my favorite thing
00:46:50 that happens in the book is uh is really
00:46:52 rubbing come all over her so let's
00:46:54 let's talk about that because this
00:46:56 that's a shitty meme that's a shitty meme
00:46:58 look the incident is fine
00:47:00 it's cool that people bring up that as
00:47:02 like an interesting outstanding
00:47:04 moment it's just me it's just me
00:47:06 who brings it up all the time because
00:47:08 it's well what I consider
00:47:10 maybe it is just you I mean when I sell
00:47:12 the book to people I tell them
00:47:14 there's an 11 year old rubbing come on
00:47:16 herself okay see
00:47:18 a thousand times more interesting to
00:47:20 me than that is just the fact
00:47:22 that a man is being destroyed for
00:47:24 having done nothing wrong well sure
00:47:26 that's the emotional content
00:47:28 of the book that's not that's intellectual
00:47:30 content rubbing come on your body
00:47:32 is not intellectually interesting it's
00:47:34 viscerally interesting I don't know
00:47:36 I don't know if I agree that
00:47:38 Mason is totally innocent
00:47:40 or totally like a nice guy
00:47:42 not bad at all I mean he's not
00:47:44 so he's not as evil as the other
00:47:46 two but he's pretty
00:47:48 annoying yeah and he's complicit
00:47:50 in a lot of which is
00:47:52 black him out he's a dumb teenager
00:47:54 he's pretty cringy yeah his desire
00:47:56 to fuck Don does
00:47:58 make him complicit in a lot
00:48:00 of bad activity what the
00:48:02 fuck are you even talking about it's
00:48:04 clearly painted in the story that
00:48:06 everything okay I mean the fact that
00:48:08 Mason take her words as joke the fact
00:48:10 that they're just that's true
00:48:12 the triflers at all
00:48:14 makes him a fucking retard
00:48:16 like all right you personally have
00:48:18 admitted to watching that that clip
00:48:20 of the guy in the ass are you
00:48:22 are you first of all are you as
00:48:24 evil as true I mean I never said
00:48:26 I wanted to watch that video or that
00:48:28 I enjoyed it in any way in fact
00:48:30 by society I guess
00:48:32 I
00:48:34 think that if you're too stupid
00:48:36 to notice that the people
00:48:38 you're hanging out with our weird
00:48:40 gross grimy greasy pieces of shit
00:48:42 then you're probably just as bad
00:48:44 yeah I mean like he
00:48:48 look he got played I will fully admit
00:48:50 he's weak I mean he's definitely weak
00:48:52 you're not you're not evil
00:48:54 but being a certain level of stupid
00:48:56 to me is complicit
00:48:58 in evil
00:49:00 I just think I think Mason
00:49:02 turned a blind eye
00:49:04 to a lot of things because
00:49:06 of the fact that he wanted to fuck Don
00:49:08 I think there's a lot of shit he could
00:49:10 have recognized he could have seen
00:49:12 where things were going but he let
00:49:14 himself be blinded because all he cared
00:49:16 about was how badly he liked this girl
00:49:18 and it's because it was an escape
00:49:20 from how shit his life is you know
00:49:22 his he hates his dad he's trying to get out
00:49:24 of the house he's you know trying to finish
00:49:26 school and all he's thinking about is like
00:49:28 this sort of fantasy this escapism that
00:49:30 he gets from imagining that he's gonna get
00:49:32 to fuck this girl you know and hoping
00:49:34 that she'll like him and like that
00:49:36 it's an escape from his life but it's allowed him
00:49:38 to turn a blind eye to all the bullshit
00:49:40 going on in the triflers you know oh yeah
00:49:42 it's not like he had any desire to like move
00:49:44 away and save his little sister he only
00:49:46 cared about fucking this guy you guys are
00:49:48 totally blown away
00:49:50 why do you keep putting words in my mouth
00:49:52 you just paid it that you just
00:49:54 when did I ever say that
00:49:56 when did I say that I did not say that
00:49:58 I said that he's so
00:50:00 worried about it he's so concerned
00:50:02 about it I didn't say it's the only thing
00:50:04 he's thinking about I said
00:50:06 that he is blinded because
00:50:08 his life is shit and he
00:50:10 can't do anything about it so he's
00:50:12 obsessed with this girl and
00:50:14 he's thinking about her all the time
00:50:16 and he's turning a blind eye to all the
00:50:18 bullshit just because he can't you know
00:50:20 he's doing it because
00:50:22 he can't get away he can't
00:50:24 escape yet he wants to but he can't
00:50:26 so he needs something to keep him
00:50:28 fucking sane and that thing
00:50:30 is obsessing over this girl but he
00:50:32 should recognize at some point that
00:50:34 A, Don is a piece of shit who doesn't
00:50:36 give a fuck about him and that should have been obvious from the beginning
00:50:38 he should have recognized that all of her friends
00:50:40 are pieces of shit that the kind of videos they were
00:50:42 watching is fucked up I mean
00:50:44 this guy is not into this stuff
00:50:46 he's admits himself you know he doesn't
00:50:48 find these videos interesting he's concerned
00:50:50 about these people but just because he wants to
00:50:52 fuck Don so badly he'll just
00:50:54 go along with all of it just keep saying yes
00:50:56 and that's a dangerous kind of thing that
00:50:58 totally happens you know
00:51:00 he'll go along with it is just
00:51:02 continue to show up to meetings and watch stuff
00:51:04 it's not like he ever agreed like because that's the
00:51:06 thing he had to go because he was too good
00:51:08 because he would have stopped because he has a moral
00:51:10 compass whereas the others are you know
00:51:12 too weak I found
00:51:14 a lot of Mason's chapters to be
00:51:16 pretty uncomfortable and particularly
00:51:18 cringy because I could
00:51:20 relate to them they did remind me
00:51:22 of stuff that I said back
00:51:24 when I was in high school like the parts where he's
00:51:26 talking about you know
00:51:28 girlfriend and Don and like
00:51:30 you know trying to like scheme his way
00:51:32 you know out of one relationship
00:51:34 it really reminded me of like the way I used
00:51:36 to think about girls all the time
00:51:38 when I was in high school so that was
00:51:40 really cringy of me because you know relating to it doesn't
00:51:42 make me not able to see that it's fucked up
00:51:44 and evil and stupid just like the other
00:51:46 two's behavior um I
00:51:48 what would stop stop
00:51:50 it's like you're putting him on the same level
00:51:52 as the other people I'm not I'm not
00:51:54 okay we're talking about look let's
00:51:56 put him on a scale all right I'm
00:51:58 complimenting
00:52:00 he's writing you Claude by
00:52:02 saying that fucking all the characters
00:52:04 were equally uncomfortable
00:52:06 which I think was the intent for different
00:52:08 reasons and and Nate you
00:52:10 you gotta understand it's like saying
00:52:12 you know you got you got
00:52:14 you got Don she's like
00:52:16 Aromanga sensei level bad
00:52:18 right and you got Mario
00:52:20 Kintania and he's like the asterisk war bad
00:52:22 and then you've got you've got
00:52:24 mason and he's like re-zero bad
00:52:26 you know he's re-zero
00:52:28 bad but they're there's a sky
00:52:30 whale of a human being I
00:52:32 I will masquerading as a man
00:52:34 I legitimately think it's unfair
00:52:36 to call Mason a bad person I don't
00:52:38 know a bad person I'm
00:52:40 just saying that he's a little
00:52:42 complicit and not totally innocent and that
00:52:44 I think that he's
00:52:46 an annoying teenager which you know
00:52:48 fuck and he's boring which is the worst thing
00:52:50 that a person can be look look
00:52:52 I just want to be like if you're saying that he's
00:52:54 I question that like I question
00:52:56 whether
00:52:58 I think he I question
00:53:00 whether he's also a sociopath
00:53:02 like Mario and Don I mean
00:53:04 you could almost call the book two sociopaths
00:53:06 and a psychopath I think I think Don
00:53:08 is the psycho but I but I
00:53:10 you know Mario's obviously a sociopath I
00:53:12 you know I wonder if he really
00:53:14 gives a shit about anyone but himself
00:53:16 because all of his writing and everything
00:53:18 his narration is all very focused on
00:53:20 himself what house
00:53:22 how are things going to turn out well for him
00:53:24 he doesn't really go with a teenager dude he's
00:53:26 15 exactly all
00:53:28 just like sociopaths yeah
00:53:30 oh wait he's he's a he's a he's a
00:53:32 whether he really even cares about his sister
00:53:34 or whether he's just you know he wants
00:53:36 to help her to feel better about himself
00:53:38 or something because he the way he
00:53:40 literally antagonizes dad doesn't
00:53:42 give a shit about his girlfriend he doesn't
00:53:44 really give a shit about Don other than he's
00:53:46 infatuated with her because he wants to fuck her
00:53:48 and that puss it's ridiculous
00:53:50 to say he doesn't care about his sister he would
00:53:52 literally antagonize his dad so that he would
00:53:54 beat him instead of the sister
00:53:56 how can you argue that he doesn't care about
00:53:58 are you and he doesn't I'm just saying I wonder
00:54:00 I'm saying I wonder I'm
00:54:02 being well here's a proof to the contrary
00:54:04 all right fine I just
00:54:06 and for what it's worth the second
00:54:08 that Lily did something
00:54:10 of her own accord that
00:54:12 he completely turns on her like that
00:54:14 yeah as soon as she takes a look at pictures
00:54:16 he starts sounding exactly like Mario
00:54:18 oh yeah yeah he was mad at her
00:54:20 and then he got over at the next
00:54:22 entry what a bad person
00:54:24 to be mad at someone
00:54:26 blowing this way out of proportion nobody
00:54:28 saying you're a bad guy we're saying
00:54:30 that he turned on her like that's some sort of
00:54:32 like yeah he broke up all
00:54:34 time no one said it was
00:54:36 irritable you mother fucker
00:54:38 yeah it's normal normal people suck
00:54:40 normal people are horrible it's
00:54:42 normal for people to be shit half
00:54:44 the time half of their lives
00:54:46 what context are we coming at this from
00:54:48 from having normal human expectations for
00:54:50 characters or expecting them all to be
00:54:52 literally perfect paradise of goodness
00:54:54 look worse things happen
00:54:56 to Mason than he deserved but he's
00:54:58 not a great guy he's just
00:55:00 a shitty teenager like every other one
00:55:02 you knew in high school he's no
00:55:04 look Mario and Don are worse than
00:55:06 anybody I've ever known yes
00:55:08 nobody I well okay that's not fair because
00:55:10 I knew a school shooter so Mario
00:55:12 was as bad as the worst guy I've ever
00:55:14 known and Don's may be a little bit worse
00:55:16 but Mason is just like
00:55:18 a lot of kids I knew in high school
00:55:20 who were just fucking dumb burnout kids
00:55:22 who didn't know what their lives
00:55:24 sucked so they had no plans
00:55:26 and they just fucked around and they made a lot of bad
00:55:28 decisions he didn't deserve to have
00:55:30 the things happen to him that did but
00:55:32 he's not a good guy he's not someone you root
00:55:34 for he's just kind of a shitty
00:55:36 little teenager who gets a lot worse
00:55:38 than he deserves you know but like at
00:55:40 no point was I like yeah Mason
00:55:42 you go until the very end where he gets
00:55:44 like a and it's only because he becomes
00:55:46 the punisher yeah it's only
00:55:48 because like so severe
00:55:50 of stuff happens to him that yeah he
00:55:52 basically has like a superhero backstory
00:55:54 now and now he's interesting at the very
00:55:56 end but like throughout the book he's fucking
00:55:58 completely lame and that's kind of the point
00:56:00 that's why it's actually kind of cathartic
00:56:02 when all the bad shit happens to him
00:56:04 because it's like oh thank god we wrote out
00:56:06 the boring guy and now we get to focus on the cool characters
00:56:08 for a while you know
00:56:10 like fuck Mason
00:56:14 you guys are ridiculous
00:56:16 I disagree that his chapters are boring
00:56:18 I think they were
00:56:20 you know just as interesting as the other two characters
00:56:22 I thought they were interesting at first
00:56:24 but eventually I just
00:56:26 but I do definitely think fuck him
00:56:28 yeah when he
00:56:30 writes when he confesses
00:56:32 in his entry I mean of course
00:56:34 of course he's the normie of course he's got the least
00:56:36 interesting thing his
00:56:38 you know it's not like his problems weren't the worst
00:56:40 his problems actually were the worst
00:56:42 of any character and yet
00:56:44 he puts up with it the most
00:56:46 he is the best person despite having the worst
00:56:48 situation you know what Nate you've swayed me
00:56:50 what I agree thank you
00:56:52 thank you I mean that's objectively true
00:56:54 I mean again like it's just that
00:56:56 his problems are all real stuff that
00:56:58 most of the people I know have gone through
00:57:00 and like it doesn't
00:57:02 most people don't
00:57:04 go through most people who are in that situation
00:57:06 don't then get put into a far worse
00:57:08 one like he does and most people
00:57:10 don't become a vigilante superhero at the
00:57:12 end of their story
00:57:14 but you know Mason's
00:57:16 started Will Smith
00:57:18 Mason's problems were stuff that I was
00:57:20 like okay yeah this is what most of
00:57:22 my friends were going through in high school
00:57:24 they had shitty home situations
00:57:26 I mean I hung out with a bunch of fucking
00:57:28 you know like potheads and stuff who were just trying
00:57:30 to do anything to get away from the house because their lives
00:57:32 fucking blue you know they had shitty
00:57:34 parents who didn't know how to take care of
00:57:36 them because they had kids when they weren't ready
00:57:38 and they lived in the ghetto like that was a lot of
00:57:40 my friends so Mason to me was like
00:57:42 yeah I know this guy I know this story
00:57:44 but he's not my friend
00:57:46 so I don't care about him the way I care about
00:57:48 my friends you know I agree
00:57:50 he had the least interesting things to say up
00:57:52 to when things turned but the point of
00:57:54 the character is that he represents
00:57:56 normalcy yeah and of course that's not
00:57:58 going to be fascinating relative normalcy
00:58:00 so I don't disagree with you at all
00:58:02 but to say that he's like well
00:58:04 I mean okay we already talked about like
00:58:06 if he's complicit and yes I will 100% agree
00:58:08 his own idiocy
00:58:10 you know everyone's idiotic to a degree
00:58:12 if they couldn't see what was going on here
00:58:14 obviously shot him in the back
00:58:16 but like the
00:58:18 the impetus I mean obviously
00:58:20 if you're dividing this up by percentages
00:58:22 I'm just saying he's gotta be like
00:58:24 tiny compared to what's going on with these other people
00:58:26 obviously
00:58:28 we're comparing again
00:58:30 re-zero bad
00:58:32 which is to say 5 out of 10
00:58:34 you know strong 5 light 6
00:58:36 if you're lucky
00:58:38 to guys who are bottom of the barrel
00:58:40 worst scum of the earth
00:58:42 you know a school shooter
00:58:44 and a fucking mass killer
00:58:46 like these are the worst that we have to offer
00:58:48 any big brother who protects
00:58:50 his little sister from abuse from an abuse of father
00:58:52 I would put above a fucking like
00:58:54 average he's better than average but okay
00:58:56 did he really protect her though
00:58:58 or did he just get her beaten up more
00:59:00 oh
00:59:02 whatever let's move on
00:59:04 we know the answer to this question
00:59:08 how about
00:59:10 Doreen
00:59:12 Dobson I believe was the male name right
00:59:14 is that the
00:59:16 the pretentious asshole trans person
00:59:18 again very
00:59:20 character I've seen
00:59:22 I'll tell you man
00:59:24 you portrayed an obnoxious
00:59:26 SJW pretty accurately
00:59:28 with that character
00:59:30 like in the name I think was
00:59:32 Doreen and Donovan
00:59:34 Donovan was like
00:59:36 I want someone to make a Dobson joke
00:59:38 as in the little blue bear guy
00:59:40 I mean it's easy enough to make fun
00:59:42 of like a you know SJWs
00:59:44 and stuff and say
00:59:46 okay they're all obnoxious pretentious
00:59:48 shitheads but like it's not even
00:59:50 that I think there's plenty of SJWs
00:59:52 who are like fine this person
00:59:54 though I have this is exactly
00:59:56 the type who
00:59:58 gets on you on Tumblr
01:00:00 you know like this is the
01:00:02 the portrait of the stereotypical SJW
01:00:04 but they do exist there are real people
01:00:06 like that and well you know this is the
01:00:08 character I this is the character
01:00:10 I think I most felt the hand of
01:00:12 Mumpkin as in like yeah by the way
01:00:14 fuck these people don't like
01:00:16 they're totally real like
01:00:18 they are real and
01:00:20 and I thought he did a good enough job of
01:00:22 like making it it didn't feel like
01:00:24 um it didn't feel
01:00:26 like just a parody because of the fact that he
01:00:28 addressed the backstory that
01:00:30 that he became this way
01:00:32 that he wasn't always like this but like
01:00:34 now that he's learned the rhetoric of
01:00:36 this movement of the social justice movement
01:00:38 he's developing these feelings
01:00:40 so even though he still hangs out with the fucking triflers
01:00:42 who are like these terrible
01:00:44 terrible people watching horrible videos like
01:00:46 you know he's still hanging around but he's trying to like convert
01:00:48 them to his new age like beliefs
01:00:50 and stuff and I thought that was totally believable
01:00:52 like I've seen people make that transition
01:00:54 before that is very interesting
01:00:56 and that it no pun intended
01:00:58 right true it kind of shows
01:01:00 the characters like deference
01:01:02 to power in that you know once once
01:01:04 you know because in her life obviously
01:01:06 she's following trends that's that's what
01:01:08 she's all about um which
01:01:10 you saw like oh I can get attention if I'm trans
01:01:12 so I'll do that I mean just not that old
01:01:14 actually but that's what this character was and
01:01:16 not to distract from you too much
01:01:18 sorry but um I actually
01:01:20 thought I felt the hand of monkey
01:01:22 perhaps too much just in the fact
01:01:24 that the characters
01:01:26 like like Don goes on this whole thing about
01:01:28 how she's like you know oh I don't have any problem
01:01:30 with trans people it's just the way that this
01:01:32 character has to do that
01:01:34 that felt a little too defensive where I was
01:01:36 like why not just make her hate trans people
01:01:38 or something or like Mario when he
01:01:40 I think he has a part where he does
01:01:42 something like that with either trans
01:01:44 or like blacks or something he has
01:01:46 some kind of like defense
01:01:48 logic and I was like no
01:01:50 just let him be a fucking racist he's already
01:01:52 a school shooter you know
01:01:54 it did kind of great on me
01:01:56 after a while and annoy me that all the
01:01:58 characters sort of talk in youtube
01:02:00 videos yeah like
01:02:02 they'll be like in the middle of a conversation
01:02:04 and Don will just lapse into like an editorial
01:02:06 on you know
01:02:08 Mario does it too and you know it's
01:02:10 like I said before about not really
01:02:12 being able to criticize it because
01:02:14 I don't know if that's intentional
01:02:16 or if that's just the way that like Don
01:02:18 writes but doesn't actually speak
01:02:20 I mean it felt a little too
01:02:22 it's true it really felt
01:02:24 a little too editorially at some
01:02:26 parts I agree there were I noticed
01:02:28 that in moments and
01:02:30 yeah like she would literally in her
01:02:32 dialogue suddenly transform into
01:02:34 a youtube video sometimes and
01:02:36 I think that's I mean
01:02:38 you can defend it all you want I think it's clumsy
01:02:40 writing monkey was 20 that's how 20
01:02:42 year olds write so
01:02:44 you know I'm gonna blame monkey for
01:02:46 that one yeah you swayed
01:02:48 me I'm gonna blame nobody to
01:02:50 the one time yeah it was definitely during the
01:02:52 the train I mean don't get me wrong
01:02:54 I'm saying that because if you go read
01:02:56 my light novel that I wrote when I was 20
01:02:58 that happens all the time
01:03:00 characters will lapse into an editorial
01:03:02 because I was used to editorial writing
01:03:04 so you know like in the middle
01:03:06 of a conversation a character will like
01:03:08 psychoanalyze himself to explain
01:03:10 to another one so
01:03:12 you should be nisei oisin
01:03:14 you're a genius nisei oisin does the same
01:03:16 shit and he started when he was that age
01:03:18 so yeah he never
01:03:20 grew out of it they only
01:03:22 whatever I don't it's silly to go back to
01:03:24 but I'm just gonna finish my point anyway it was just that
01:03:26 Dorianne she was
01:03:28 a bitch to social pressure decided to be
01:03:30 a cool trans person and then
01:03:32 when Dawn asserts herself
01:03:34 as the leader of the group she
01:03:36 notices she bows to the
01:03:38 new authority in her life which is Dawn
01:03:40 so shows that she is a weak, spineless person too
01:03:42 there you go that's just the character
01:03:44 how about
01:03:46 I mean there's not a lot to say about
01:03:48 Chao or Chao's uncle
01:03:50 cause Chao's uncle first of all
01:03:52 but the more interesting of the two
01:03:54 just like a war vet who got a taste for blood
01:03:56 wants to kill people thinks it's really cool
01:03:58 those two also fascinated me in a way
01:04:00 and I have to ask Mumki did you have
01:04:02 Asian friends like that before
01:04:04 are you talking to me you cut out
01:04:06 yeah yeah did you have Asian friends
01:04:08 like the two
01:04:10 the brothers
01:04:12 every single person in the tribe
01:04:14 is based off of one of my high school friends
01:04:16 yeah I figured because
01:04:18 that particular brand of Asian
01:04:20 household is familiar to me
01:04:22 of like
01:04:24 the kids
01:04:26 the younger generation of the household
01:04:28 just being super disaffected because
01:04:30 their parents are from a completely different culture
01:04:32 and they just don't even know what's going on with their kids
01:04:34 like
01:04:36 there's a level of disconnect
01:04:38 like you can tell the mother
01:04:40 just literally does not understand her children
01:04:42 cause they are American and she's not
01:04:44 you know and so like
01:04:46 she just tries to be the default mother
01:04:48 because she does not understand what the hell
01:04:50 well when's her brother right
01:04:52 yeah but the brother
01:04:54 is younger than her I think
01:04:56 by a good amount and he being
01:04:58 ex-military he kinda reminded me
01:05:00 of like an evil version
01:05:02 of
01:05:04 my friend
01:05:06 my Asian friend Donson who has a cousin who lives with them
01:05:08 who's like that age and he's like
01:05:10 similarly a very like physically active
01:05:12 outgoing guy you know mostly kinda quiet
01:05:14 but like watches a lot of movies
01:05:16 and does a lot of travel and like lots of interesting
01:05:18 random weird things and like
01:05:20 this the you know
01:05:22 the older guy kinda reminded
01:05:24 me of that a little bit
01:05:26 like they just everything about
01:05:28 the way that house was described and the way the kids act
01:05:30 and everything I was like
01:05:32 yeah I've been in that house before
01:05:34 and to some extent like not that exact
01:05:36 one but it's like an accumulation
01:05:38 of different Asian households I've been in
01:05:40 and I totally got it
01:05:42 I thought it was cool because
01:05:44 the whole time I was picturing
01:05:46 this veteran chow's uncle as Rambo
01:05:48 you know the returning vet
01:05:50 he's back
01:05:52 hey man this is really bad enough Casio but I'm back
01:05:54 and I just wanna hurt people now
01:05:56 look at my fucking youtube videos guys
01:05:58 yeah that's my Rambo impression
01:06:00 that's um
01:06:02 I don't know I was picturing like imagine
01:06:04 you know that scene where Don walks into his room
01:06:06 to like tell him like hey let's start experimenting on people
01:06:08 imagine like Rambo in the corner just like
01:06:10 sitting there all bunched up just like
01:06:12 I love that she pretentiously
01:06:14 criticizes him for having
01:06:16 a pulp fiction and fight club poster
01:06:18 that really stuck with me
01:06:20 cause I would totally have
01:06:22 those you know like
01:06:24 I it was
01:06:26 yeah that's what that guy would have
01:06:28 of course he would you know like
01:06:30 yeah he's gonna have two
01:06:32 good hyper masculine films in his fucking
01:06:34 you know well one's a hyper masculine
01:06:36 film at least and the other one's comparable
01:06:38 like yeah why wouldn't he
01:06:40 it just a lot of the character details
01:06:42 in this book really definitely
01:06:44 resonated with me like every character felt like
01:06:46 somebody who I kind of knew
01:06:48 and you know uh I feel like
01:06:50 Mumkey's high school friends are probably not
01:06:52 similar from mine in
01:06:54 in that case
01:06:56 mm-hmm
01:06:58 I do want to mention about Chao
01:07:00 was that his character was an experiment
01:07:02 on my part to see
01:07:04 how full fledged of a character
01:07:06 I could create who has zero
01:07:08 lines of dialogue in the whole book
01:07:10 I was going to comment on that
01:07:12 yeah I was going to see if you guys even noticed
01:07:14 that he didn't say a single word
01:07:16 I did but only towards the end
01:07:18 like there was a moment where I suddenly was like
01:07:20 he's never spoken has he like
01:07:22 uh yeah I thought you did a pretty
01:07:24 okay job like I mean he's obviously like
01:07:26 the least interesting character because of it
01:07:28 but I felt like I understood
01:07:30 his character in spite of it I sort of like
01:07:32 spaced out
01:07:34 his entire existence in the story
01:07:36 yeah like I thought like the Chao's uncle
01:07:38 was just a guy called Chao's uncle
01:07:40 it's
01:07:42 isn't it fascinating though that the more active
01:07:44 interesting character there would be referred to as Chao's uncle
01:07:46 while Chao was just the non-entity
01:07:48 in the in the situation
01:07:50 and one moment that really stuck
01:07:52 out to me was when
01:07:54 after the meeting after she and Tao
01:07:56 you know the uncle talk
01:07:58 and they announced their plans to the group
01:08:00 and Chao just looks bored
01:08:02 yeah very very interesting
01:08:04 very interesting response I want to know what's
01:08:06 going on with this guy I like that because I feel
01:08:08 like he's just
01:08:10 so utterly doesn't give a
01:08:12 fuck that it like none of it
01:08:14 matters like he's just he's a super alpha
01:08:16 he doesn't give a fuck about anything
01:08:18 I mean I feel again like I've known
01:08:20 I've known people who are
01:08:22 kind of like I assume he's probably a pretty
01:08:24 smart guy who does well in school
01:08:26 and like but
01:08:28 but doesn't give a like has no particular
01:08:30 opinions about anything just doesn't care
01:08:32 just let's life pass by because he doesn't
01:08:34 he has no aspirations
01:08:36 and no nothing to care about
01:08:38 he's just letting the people around him control
01:08:40 and he hangs out with these with the triflers because
01:08:42 probably his options are
01:08:44 hang out with Asian kids or weirdos
01:08:46 because you know as an Asian
01:08:48 kid you're probably not going to hang out with like
01:08:50 Jax and all the like white kids
01:08:52 or whatever you know so you're going to end up
01:08:54 hanging out with like the either the freaks
01:08:56 or the other Asians and he ends up hanging out
01:08:58 with the freaks you know
01:09:00 yeah I love casual racism
01:09:02 Chinese people can't do anything
01:09:04 not being racist I'm anything being sympathetic
01:09:06 towards this is what like
01:09:08 towards the weaker race of Asians
01:09:10 my group of friends I was
01:09:12 the freaks in high school you know
01:09:14 and like that's who are you
01:09:16 saying that Asians are the freaks of society
01:09:18 I'm saying that
01:09:20 like for instance my friend Brandon
01:09:22 Tolentino he hung out with this guy
01:09:24 aren pretty much exclusively because
01:09:26 both of them were Filipino and
01:09:28 so they hung out together even though
01:09:30 they weren't necessarily friends
01:09:32 they just hung out because they were the
01:09:34 Filipino kids and that's what
01:09:36 you just end up gravitating to people who are your race
01:09:38 my high school is extremely mixed
01:09:40 so we had like probably half the school
01:09:42 was black half the school was white
01:09:44 and you know some percentage of other
01:09:46 ethnicities and like
01:09:48 the black kids all hung out together and the white
01:09:50 kids all hung out together and the ethnic
01:09:52 kids all hung out together and the only
01:09:54 group that was like super mixed
01:09:56 like you know they'll be mixing here and there
01:09:58 but it was the freaks and weirdos who
01:10:00 was a true
01:10:02 multicultural group because we're internet denizens
01:10:04 and stuff we don't give a fuck you know
01:10:06 we're outsiders we don't feel like we're part
01:10:08 of our race so that's how a kid like that
01:10:10 ends up with a group like that I think
01:10:14 yeah yeah
01:10:16 he was in a bit of an enigma to me um
01:10:18 well shit
01:10:20 what else we got have we talked enough about
01:10:22 Mario specifically because I feel like
01:10:24 we might have glazed over him
01:10:26 a little bit in our in our rush talk
01:10:28 about other guys I love the way
01:10:30 he's fat he is fat
01:10:32 unfortunately I think the the best thing
01:10:34 about Mario um in his
01:10:36 presentation in this book is that
01:10:38 this book shits on him in
01:10:40 a big way like
01:10:42 because I know he's based on Elliott Roger
01:10:44 and monkey's done he's read the entire
01:10:46 Elliott Roger um you know
01:10:48 uh manifesto and all that
01:10:50 and one of the things about
01:10:52 monkey's relationship relationship with Elliott Roger
01:10:54 is that he does make fun of the guy
01:10:56 and point out that he's a fucking retarded idiot
01:10:58 and that's a big part of this
01:11:00 book is that Mario spends this whole
01:11:02 book building himself up and having all
01:11:04 these grandiose opinions and in
01:11:06 the end he accomplishes almost nothing
01:11:08 you know he just he goes
01:11:10 in he he kills one
01:11:12 guy who is the guy who stopped him
01:11:14 who becomes a fucking martyr and a hero
01:11:16 for all time you know his target
01:11:18 as one of these people that have to be disposed
01:11:20 of was the hero and
01:11:22 save people the real the real lesson
01:11:24 to take away from it is thank god that
01:11:26 mass killers are always the weakest
01:11:28 most beta pathetic people in society
01:11:30 because if they were strong like
01:11:32 me we'd all be doomed
01:11:34 right well you know if they if they had avenues
01:11:36 if they had levers at their disposal to climb
01:11:38 social ranks and alleviate their issues they probably
01:11:40 would but they that's the thing I just push to
01:11:42 the point of desperation I love it because I feel
01:11:44 like most people if they heard
01:11:46 about a mass shooting book
01:11:48 they would assume it's going to
01:11:50 in some way glamorize it
01:11:52 or painted as like this big epic thing
01:11:54 and the book there's a lot of build up
01:11:56 to this school shooting so you're thinking
01:11:58 it's gonna be this like huge epic
01:12:00 bloodbath or a big action scene and instead
01:12:02 the book goes way out of its way to undercut
01:12:04 it as harshly as possible and so
01:12:06 if you you know let's say someone
01:12:08 tried to read this book thinking oh
01:12:10 I'm like some edge lords like oh I
01:12:12 want to read about a fucking school shooting yeah
01:12:14 and then they get to that part and it just
01:12:16 slaps them in the face with how retarded
01:12:18 a school shooter is and how badly
01:12:20 he fucks up you know I hope
01:12:22 the school I hope that edge lords the world over
01:12:24 read this book and realize how that's not
01:12:26 yeah you got to be a little bit like dawn and realize
01:12:28 that school shootings are highly inefficient
01:12:30 at changing the world and god
01:12:32 their beta depression
01:12:34 Mario's plan will finally be fulfilled
01:12:36 we'll have a college school after all
01:12:38 Mario's biggest problem to me I think
01:12:40 was a lack of self-awareness and even when
01:12:42 done clearly point out that every school
01:12:44 shooter is a lack of self-awareness
01:12:46 they don't realize it's just not realizing
01:12:48 that it's your fault not the world's or
01:12:50 or that the people who
01:12:52 it is their fault you're completely misguided
01:12:54 on who they are like Elliott Roger
01:12:56 there's people he could have blamed but he
01:12:58 didn't blame those people you know he
01:13:00 blamed the girls who wouldn't
01:13:02 sleep with him
01:13:04 because they literally he just never even
01:13:06 asked so because he never
01:13:08 like so Mario you know his rage is
01:13:10 completely misguided and the book
01:13:12 points that out and shows
01:13:14 it this book paints Mario as a fucking
01:13:16 idiot and it paints his
01:13:18 revenge is pathetic and it paints him as
01:13:20 a failure and I think that's
01:13:22 great because I don't think
01:13:24 a lot of I don't think there's a lot of people who could have
01:13:26 written that and still made it feel
01:13:28 real like there's people who would have
01:13:30 you know imagine like
01:13:32 a normie guy writing this book like
01:13:34 someone who like heard about a school shooting who's just like
01:13:36 some guy that read fucking 13 reasons
01:13:38 why or some shit like that you know and that's
01:13:40 the problem with 13 you know there's a
01:13:42 Netflix series airing right now and Victor
01:13:44 pointed this out that in that show
01:13:46 there's a character who they're building up to be a
01:13:48 school shooter but he doesn't have the personality
01:13:50 of one he doesn't act like what
01:13:52 a school shooter would act like that any
01:13:54 anyone could point that out Mario
01:13:56 is a completely realized school
01:13:58 shooter but the book still
01:14:00 shits on him for being that you know and I
01:14:02 think that's a cool aspect of it
01:14:04 that uh was it was definitely
01:14:06 one of the funnier twists in the book to
01:14:08 read him just like utterly get shit on
01:14:10 and fail horribly and it was
01:14:12 like ah you dumb fuck
01:14:14 which I mean I mean
01:14:16 agreed the guy who I know the school
01:14:18 shooter that I grew up with
01:14:20 who was a friend of mine when I was a little kid
01:14:22 um he didn't even get
01:14:24 to accomplish it because he made youtube videos
01:14:26 bragging about all his guns and how he was going to shoot
01:14:28 up a school and so he got busted because
01:14:30 he's a fucking retard so
01:14:32 man what about that American
01:14:34 hero who tackled Mario
01:14:36 and wrestled the grenade out of him and blew up
01:14:38 that's Bryce
01:14:40 Bryce whatever yeah and
01:14:42 what's great about that is that
01:14:44 Bryce Dallas thundercot
01:14:46 what's great about that part is you know Mario
01:14:48 had portrayed that guy as like
01:14:50 this asshole normie piece of shit
01:14:52 but he's clearly like
01:14:54 yeah a total hero like he saves
01:14:56 well that's kind of
01:14:58 that's kind of what Jesse says all the time
01:15:00 about he was spires to norminess
01:15:02 yeah norminess is next to godliness
01:15:04 when you're an outsider of society
01:15:06 it's easy to just demonize everybody
01:15:08 or view them as you know
01:15:10 because they're ostracizing you and they must be evil
01:15:12 and you know to a certain extent it's kind of like
01:15:14 um uh you know like
01:15:16 uh an outsider mentality like if you're not one
01:15:18 of us uh you know we're gonna treat you like
01:15:20 shit but at the very least
01:15:22 at the very least these people are they're pretty good
01:15:24 to each other you know they they want to protect
01:15:26 each other guys like Bryce
01:15:28 not a bad guy certainly not a bad guy
01:15:30 probably has parents in the
01:15:32 he probably has like parents in the military
01:15:34 who while strict with
01:15:36 him and therefore he acts out
01:15:38 they nonetheless are like very proud
01:15:40 people like very America's
01:15:42 beautiful place you gotta protect your citizens
01:15:44 you know I bet that's the house he grew up
01:15:46 see that that's the thing about guys like Mario
01:15:48 or even guys like you know Isis or whatever
01:15:50 like they they're viewing
01:15:52 individuals as part of like
01:15:54 guys like Isis
01:15:56 not a not a fan
01:15:58 of that guy uh yeah
01:16:00 like these they they paint
01:16:02 you know like they're the whole terrorist and Mario
01:16:04 is literally a terrorist like he's hoping to
01:16:06 inspire terror to make society
01:16:08 change that's literally what what terrorism is
01:16:10 and um
01:16:12 like you have to view people
01:16:14 as part of a collective because he's just
01:16:16 Mario had specific targets right of course but Mario
01:16:18 didn't care to like look into their stories
01:16:20 and and you can see this clearly
01:16:22 that he was not even interested in diving
01:16:24 deeper when he starts painting people
01:16:26 like Marissa this angel who
01:16:28 gave him a chance and was such a wonderful person
01:16:30 him that he did everything wrong to
01:16:32 and destroyed his own chances with he says like
01:16:34 I would have loved to have killed her too
01:16:36 but she's not at this school because it's all about
01:16:38 him and how he's the sad one and how
01:16:40 you know the why hasn't life
01:16:42 and that's exactly what Elliot Roger was like
01:16:44 that he was he wanted to kill his own little
01:16:46 brother who he literally
01:16:48 loved and who never did anything wrong
01:16:50 and he wanted to kill him so he wouldn't turn out
01:16:52 because one day he will have sex
01:16:54 one day he'll have sex and that's
01:16:56 unacceptable that cannot happen
01:16:58 what a fucking monster
01:17:00 not
01:17:02 a fan of that guy
01:17:04 um which is why you know
01:17:06 just on a little rant here I get pretty pissed
01:17:08 when people like lion eyes Elliot
01:17:10 or like celebrate him in any way
01:17:12 because he's just a monster
01:17:14 that no one should like
01:17:16 admire in any way
01:17:18 there's probably I'm sure there's a great deal of irony
01:17:20 going on here but
01:17:22 you know the water's getting muddy to some points
01:17:24 so I guess I'm just saying don't get carried away
01:17:26 with it folks he's not a good person
01:17:28 he is a literal murderer
01:17:30 if you saw you he would kill you
01:17:32 so keep that in mind
01:17:34 do we have anything else to say about the book?
01:17:36 any untapped
01:17:38 any um shit
01:17:40 monkey is there anything you want to hear us
01:17:42 talk about about your book?
01:17:44 uh no nothing specific
01:17:46 I was just gonna say I've been waiting over a year
01:17:48 to hear people have an actual conversation
01:17:50 about this and I thought it would
01:17:52 like when I was writing and I thought it would never happen
01:17:54 I thought nobody would read it so this last hour
01:17:56 has been like pretty fucking great
01:17:58 for me like even even the parts where you're
01:18:00 shitting on some of the writing I'm thinking
01:18:02 finally somebody is acknowledging
01:18:04 what I did
01:18:06 that's great that's great all it takes is a hero
01:18:08 like Nate Bestman to read your book
01:18:10 and bam instant well instant celebrity
01:18:12 yeah I mean I talked to monkey
01:18:14 about some of my issues with it back in
01:18:16 March but I again
01:18:18 wanted to hold off till more people had read it
01:18:20 because I was literally the first person to
01:18:22 read it because I got an early copy
01:18:24 um so I didn't
01:18:26 want to like air any of this out and like
01:18:28 you know when people get it in their heads
01:18:30 they're gonna read it that way like if anyone
01:18:32 listened to this podcast before reading the book
01:18:34 they're going to now read some of our criticisms
01:18:36 into it but uh but they'll also
01:18:38 read our more in-depth analysis
01:18:40 into it so you know
01:18:42 I just want to say that I'm uh
01:18:44 I'm immensely proud of you monkey
01:18:46 that you actually
01:18:48 wrote this book and published it yourself
01:18:50 and that you have an actual
01:18:52 like a real novel under your belt
01:18:54 that's amazing to me it's um
01:18:56 it's a thing that I haven't done and it's a
01:18:58 thing that I respect immensely far more
01:19:00 than any ridiculous retarded
01:19:02 YouTube video
01:19:04 of course
01:19:06 I would say this book
01:19:08 is the only thing I've ever made in my life
01:19:10 that I'm proud of like all the YouTube is
01:19:12 just like a fucking joke to me compared to this
01:19:14 thing
01:19:16 well that's nice
01:19:18 I'd say that just on a
01:19:20 I don't know a literary note I guess
01:19:22 this thing was an absolute page turner
01:19:24 and consumed it
01:19:26 uh voraciously
01:19:28 and and loved reading it and it was really
01:19:30 really good and
01:19:32 I read this book at night because
01:19:34 I was trying to read it before monkey got to my house
01:19:36 um incidentally
01:19:38 I read the entire book while non-stop listening
01:19:40 to slipknot corn and
01:19:42 Marilyn Manson um and I would
01:19:44 highly recommend you do the same so you can get into
01:19:46 the school shooter mindset but uh
01:19:48 I read the entire book listening to the
01:19:50 Stone Cold Steve Austin podcast
01:19:52 talking about wrestling
01:19:54 um and doing it for the working man
01:19:56 give me a hell yeah
01:19:58 I will say that I think the
01:20:00 early part
01:20:02 there's like this book has a lot of build up
01:20:04 and I do think it's probably
01:20:06 longer than it needs to be
01:20:08 um I think that the mid
01:20:10 section is the weak point when we
01:20:12 get to dawn working at the ice cream
01:20:14 place like up and like
01:20:16 when she gets locked in the freezer pretty much
01:20:18 everything from that onwards is
01:20:20 great like that's where the book really takes
01:20:22 off is after after she gets out of
01:20:24 the freezer and all of her schemes from then on
01:20:26 all of that is fantastic
01:20:28 um and the early part where the setting up
01:20:30 the characters is good but just that mid section
01:20:32 when she gets the job and she goes into so much
01:20:34 fucking detail about working there
01:20:36 I like had I not been trying
01:20:38 to finish the book that night I would have been at risk
01:20:40 of not finishing the book just because
01:20:42 I read books while I take a shit
01:20:44 a lot of the time I try to get through
01:20:46 like one chapter per shit and
01:20:48 if I read a whole chapter of just dawn
01:20:50 book and describe your workplace I would have been like
01:20:52 okay and my name is
01:20:54 Don Blackie I work at
01:20:56 Jerry Queen I like to be mean to people
01:20:58 and torture people I'm a really
01:21:00 smart girl
01:21:02 that's the whole book
01:21:04 I want the Jesse Wood audio
01:21:06 book of the Triforce
01:21:08 yeah that'd be great because that is Don's voice
01:21:10 at all times through all her narration
01:21:12 I wear pig socks because I'm
01:21:14 a girl
01:21:16 well fucking exposed
01:21:18 I
01:21:20 I wanted to say that I
01:21:22 yeah like I loved reading this
01:21:24 I tried my best to finish it
01:21:26 in one sitting but I am a genius
01:21:28 but I could not finish it in the four and a half
01:21:30 hours of my first flight so I took till I came
01:21:32 home from the trip I was on
01:21:34 it was wonderful I
01:21:36 was thoroughly entertained the whole way
01:21:38 I did not find
01:21:40 like I was
01:21:42 in hard enough by the point where she got to that
01:21:44 where I was totally willing
01:21:46 to take the journey that Don was providing
01:21:48 me of like exploring her workplace
01:21:50 because I knew that it was leading to something
01:21:52 and when the place burns down and you
01:21:54 get to think about all the details that she gave
01:21:56 us all going up in flames I enjoyed that
01:21:58 immensely and I don't know
01:22:00 maybe I had more patience or something for better or ill
01:22:02 I was I was disgusted
01:22:04 on deep levels but in the right
01:22:06 ways I was I was provoked
01:22:08 I was I was made to think about
01:22:10 real things and I'm a very
01:22:12 I don't know very like issues driven kind of guy
01:22:14 and you really presented things in a way that
01:22:16 that that that as you've
01:22:18 shown that you're quite capable of doing
01:22:20 you know really made me think
01:22:22 about the real issues going on here behind
01:22:24 the scenes not just a fucking
01:22:26 puff piece about school shooters now cool
01:22:28 they are you really got down to the
01:22:30 deep issues and I could it seemed
01:22:32 to me that a
01:22:34 lot of it came from
01:22:36 you know that not to go
01:22:38 crazy with conspiracies here but like
01:22:40 like you you really understood
01:22:42 you know like the the the motivations that would go
01:22:44 for a character like Mario
01:22:46 and and the way they're able to construct this
01:22:48 you know not not like a complete rip off
01:22:50 of Elliot or anything but like this new character
01:22:52 you know having all the
01:22:54 just a real clear understanding
01:22:56 of why someone would be driven at this point
01:22:58 I thought was fascinating especially as someone
01:23:00 who has probably never had anything
01:23:02 close to clinical depression for me
01:23:04 it was a very educating experience
01:23:06 to just kind of dive down into this world
01:23:08 and see what it's like down there and
01:23:10 to to I don't know maybe
01:23:12 hopefully be able to use this experience
01:23:14 to do what I think you want people
01:23:16 to take away think about how to actively
01:23:18 avoid this shit in the future
01:23:20 and see what we can do but
01:23:22 that's that's where I'm at it was great
01:23:24 loved it to summarize my thoughts
01:23:26 I mean I think this is a really
01:23:28 impressive book and piece
01:23:30 of work especially for having been written
01:23:32 by a fucking 20 year old
01:23:34 because again
01:23:36 I get inundated with people sending me shit
01:23:38 they've written all the time I usually can't make it
01:23:40 past the first paragraph or the first page
01:23:42 this is from people who you know
01:23:44 tout themselves as writers like
01:23:46 people who really think oh my god
01:23:48 this is what I'm gonna do and I love writing
01:23:50 and they send me something and it's bullshit
01:23:52 you know I expected it to not be
01:23:54 shit because your videos aren't shit
01:23:56 but when I was started reading it I didn't expect
01:23:58 to be like hooked and actually want to read
01:24:00 the whole thing and I did
01:24:02 you know it's obviously
01:24:04 it's interesting if we could get this much fucking
01:24:06 conversation out of it which is more than I could say
01:24:08 for a lot of stories and
01:24:10 you know
01:24:12 I had a good time I would say
01:24:14 you know weak parts aside it's still
01:24:16 a really interesting book lots lots to
01:24:18 relate to lots to connect with and
01:24:20 for what it's worth I'm extremely excited
01:24:22 to see where you'll go later because
01:24:24 writing unlike any other
01:24:26 medium is not something that anyone
01:24:28 is a master at young
01:24:30 there's never been
01:24:32 a like world famous author
01:24:34 who got world famous
01:24:36 before their 30s like everyone
01:24:38 has to work up for that
01:24:40 what about the famous author
01:24:42 Harry Potter
01:24:44 his series of autobiographies
01:24:46 sold up trillion copies
01:24:48 I think the only outlier would be
01:24:50 Essie Hilton who wrote
01:24:52 The Outsiders when she was like 16
01:24:54 but otherwise you're pretty much right
01:24:56 yeah authors never blow up huge
01:24:58 when they're young it's one of the only mediums
01:25:00 where like you really have to study at it
01:25:02 for for a long time and so
01:25:04 to be putting out something impressive
01:25:06 enough that three
01:25:08 relatively harsh critics mind you
01:25:10 are I mean
01:25:12 I at least I'm a relatively harsh critic
01:25:14 if this was interesting you'd know
01:25:16 yeah you would definitely know
01:25:18 I'd let you know so to have written that at
01:25:20 20 I can't wait to see what you will
01:25:22 be writing by the time you are 30 if
01:25:24 you're still writing fiction
01:25:26 and if you still have ideas that are at
01:25:28 least you know half as interesting as
01:25:30 this one
01:25:32 I can only assume you'll get better as a writer
01:25:34 as time goes on so yeah
01:25:36 you know I think I'm with didgy
01:25:38 on the fact that I think simplicity might be key for your next
01:25:40 work so when you're writing that and you say goodbye
01:25:42 cruel world and you're heading out to that rope
01:25:44 hanging in your closet that
01:25:46 you know just just leave it at that you know
01:25:48 just leave it at that
01:25:50 what
01:25:52 kill yourself I'm saying kill yourself
01:25:54 that's what I'm saying it's my next big magnum
01:25:56 but it's your suicide
01:25:58 that's what I'm kidding that's the joke
01:26:00 that's the joke okay good
01:26:02 bam closer
01:26:04 nailed it I think we should all agree
01:26:06 that next week we'll come back together
01:26:08 and review that anime snobs
01:26:10 book in the same way
01:26:12 someone should
01:26:14 read that and let me know how it is though
01:26:16 I was told it's an autistic version
01:26:18 of dune
01:26:20 that sounds like what you would write
01:26:22 so I'm not surprised at all by that
01:26:24 when did he write this when did he write it
01:26:26 like a year ago
01:26:28 oh we should have had him on this right now
01:26:30 to review the book what were we thinking
01:26:32 did he read it
01:26:34 I came in for the last part of the podcast
01:26:36 he's never going to read it because I won't send him
01:26:38 a pdf
01:26:40 what a piece of shit
01:26:42 well
01:26:44 so long
01:26:46 go buy the triflers on the link in the description
01:26:48 if you haven't read it yet and you'd like to
01:26:50 um
01:26:52 written by monkey jones
01:26:54 we're proud of it
01:26:56 and we're not just saying that
01:26:58 and maybe someday
01:27:00 we can be proud of him too
01:27:02 yeah
01:27:04 that's the whole point of my life
01:27:06 is to make my parents proud
01:27:08 I haven't done it yet but hopefully someday
01:27:10 well here's hoping
01:27:12 thanks for listening everybody see you next time
01:27:14 bye
