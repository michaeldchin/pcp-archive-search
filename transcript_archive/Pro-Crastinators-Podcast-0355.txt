00:00:00 Hello, welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. It's ya boi Ben Saint and ya girl Gibbontake.
00:00:19 Hi-ya! Hi-ya!
00:00:26 I don't know, okay. I don't know if this might be a voicemail. I haven't checked, but I want to post something that was posted in The Pro Crastinators Patreon Lounge.
00:00:40 And I just thought it was epic. So if you'll indulge me.
00:00:47 Yeah, dude, I don't think I may have seen this.
00:00:52 I probably did.
00:00:54 I don't want you to see it. I want you to hear it.
00:00:57 Oh.
00:00:59 Here it is. It's a little soundbeat from I'll Die.
00:01:06 Oh, yeah.
00:01:08 Yeah, you saw this, dammit. 3, 2, 1, go.
00:01:11 I'm only the only thing I'm a slave to.
00:01:18 Is the grind.
00:01:19 Is the grind. Is the sigma grind. Is the rhythm. Is the rhythm of the jungle beat.
00:01:28 I'm also a slave to such beats.
00:01:31 That little, that little, what is it, like a little cat's meow?
00:01:34 Ow, in the background.
00:01:39 That's exactly what I'm talking about. This guy fucking gets it.
00:01:45 I think that noise is like Diddy Kong going, ow.
00:01:49 Yeah, I think it is. Yeah, I think it is.
00:01:52 Ow.
00:01:54 All right. That was pretty cool. The discord.
00:02:01 Did I say on the show what I want to do with the discord?
00:02:04 Or do we just talk about that? Because I might mention it now.
00:02:09 I can't remember.
00:02:11 Well, I'll just say it.
00:02:13 When we release the Perfect Comic Party, I think I would like,
00:02:17 maybe we'll just make a new channel for people to do dedicated comic discussion.
00:02:23 Just the new comics that are in this, the latest episode of the,
00:02:27 of the Perfect Comic Party.
00:02:30 Maybe that would also be where people might do like,
00:02:33 reader surveys.
00:02:35 Or something, you know?
00:02:36 Yeah.
00:02:37 Talked about like doing like Shonen Jump style reader surveys.
00:02:40 But at the very least a channel for like,
00:02:42 discuss the comics in the thing.
00:02:46 Yes.
00:02:47 I have, I have about eight and a half pages of Beescapades done now.
00:02:54 Yo, nice.
00:02:56 Yeah, it's coming along.
00:02:58 Maybe I can get the rest done this week.
00:03:00 It's a bit ambitious, but you know, I'm going to,
00:03:03 I'm going to keep trying and keep trying my way at it.
00:03:05 What is your goal for pages?
00:03:09 Around 20.
00:03:11 20, okay.
00:03:13 Around 20, I think, because I feel like a page of Beescapades
00:03:14 is a little less substantial than a, than a Clarissa page.
00:03:18 So I thought I should have at least as many as there are Clarissa pages.
00:03:21 Probably more.
00:03:23 I mean, I don't know about substantial.
00:03:25 Like it's hard to, it's definitely a single page of Clarissa takes longer to draw.
00:03:32 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:03:34 There's a lot going on with all the text and stuff.
00:03:36 I watched a bit of your stream when you were drawing it.
00:03:38 Yes.
00:03:40 Yeah, that was this week.
00:03:42 I did my first draw stream in like years.
00:03:44 And I got like, I got like, I think I got like three pages done.
00:03:48 On that one stream, which is pretty good.
00:03:51 That's, that's pretty good.
00:03:53 As I've said, over and over again, Beescapades.
00:04:00 I'm, I'm not going to, I'm not going to say what it is,
00:04:04 but like I was working on it like yesterday and this morning.
00:04:07 And I'm, I'm, I'm introducing some stuff that is not going to be relevant
00:04:12 for a long time.
00:04:14 Beescapades has room to grow, let's just say as concepts.
00:04:21 That's all I'm going to say about it.
00:04:24 I'm pretty, I'm pretty excited about it, but like there's a lot of like,
00:04:29 there's a lot of like setup that needs to happen.
00:04:34 And I'm not sure, I'm not exactly sure what is going to happen in the rest of this first chapter.
00:04:42 Right now he's, it's been Bees, Bees hustler exploring like the town.
00:04:47 And then where he goes after he fully explores the town.
00:04:51 It's like, I don't know, I could, I could take it in like one or two different,
00:04:55 I could take it in one or two different directions.
00:04:57 I guess that's the beauty of being able to ask people to do the decision making part.
00:05:04 Yeah, I kind of miss it.
00:05:06 I kind of miss it because I have not had consistent like reader suggestions.
00:05:10 Like a lot of my, I kind of just, a lot of panels just, just drop like the command format.
00:05:17 Like he just, it's like a real comic.
00:05:20 He just does something instead of like there being a text command that he then follows,
00:05:25 which is, it's fine.
00:05:27 It's fine, but it feels a little, there's just like less text.
00:05:31 And I, I don't know.
00:05:36 I kind of, it's sort of a, it would sort of be nice to just have someone tell me like,
00:05:42 have him do this next. And I'll be like, okay.
00:05:44 Kind of takes the pressure off me a little bit.
00:05:48 I don't have to construct anything.
00:05:51 I just need to do as I'm told.
00:05:54 Well, it's like this. Well, it's like this.
00:05:56 I know there are several things he could do and I'm not really committed to like,
00:06:00 oh, he should do them in a particular order.
00:06:01 So I guess it's just kind of nice to have the audience be like, oh, do that, do that.
00:06:05 Oh, what about that thing?
00:06:07 And then it's like, okay, I'll follow the direction that, that someone is telling me,
00:06:10 that someone's interested in seeing it.
00:06:12 Now, without that, I have to decide what the most interesting order is.
00:06:16 And it's like, I can't be trusted.
00:06:19 That level of responsibility.
00:06:21 I need to go back to my old Baaljape draw streams because I can't remember
00:06:28 how much it was like, I didn't stream drawing the entire comic, but a lot of the beginning,
00:06:36 when I was just like making stuff and there was a few people in chat and I know there was this idea
00:06:43 that it would be like, you'd say something in chat and I'll see if I could see what happens.
00:06:48 But I don't know if much of it was like that.
00:06:50 I think a lot of it was just sort of, and then they go here and then they go there.
00:06:54 And it was kind of fun just making stuff up.
00:06:57 And it was like serendipitous how it came together at the end with all the little stupid things,
00:07:05 all the things I'd just drawn in the background, like the big wooden slingshot outside became like,
00:07:14 the snakes got stuck to it and then it became a slingshot and then the ball came and it smashed through the wall.
00:07:23 It's like, oh wow, I made it all fit.
00:07:30 But it's hard, it's hard to think so far ahead that you know that that's how it's going to be
00:07:36 and that that's going to be left there.
00:07:39 That's a, what's the thing, the gun, the Chekhov's gun?
00:07:44 Yeah, yeah.
00:07:48 Oh sorry.
00:07:49 No, no, that's the main point, it's hard to do that.
00:07:52 Did you know how jailbreak, I mean, Bale-Jape was going to end?
00:07:58 No idea.
00:07:59 You had no idea?
00:08:00 Okay, because like I pretty much-
00:08:01 I didn't even know what the location was until I drew like, oh, what if it's like in a big lava place,
00:08:09 like she looks out the window and there's lava and then you look out, you believe the window
00:08:15 and then it's like a big cathedral and it's like, and then there's ostriches.
00:08:19 I don't know why I put that in there.
00:08:22 I know the kind of general arc of Beescapades and I think there's only one way it really can end,
00:08:31 so that's like not really-
00:08:34 Consider this Beescapaded.
00:08:37 So that's not really up for debate and like how he gets there is kind of not, you know,
00:08:42 there's room for fucking around on the way there, I feel like, is why, you know, the reader input format there,
00:08:50 it's like, yeah, let people just tell me, like, oh, do this, do that, and we'll just see what happens.
00:08:55 Because like, it won't affect the ultimate end.
00:09:04 I mean, I don't want to go, I guess I shouldn't say anymore.
00:09:08 You're in that artistic state where you really want to tell everyone, you really want everyone to know like how cool this is going to be,
00:09:16 but you can't say anything to anyone at any point.
00:09:18 If I say anything about it, it'll spoil everything.
00:09:22 If I said like, you know, Beescapades, it has concepts, it has guiding principles,
00:09:30 and if I said what those principles are, it would be like, I think it would spoil like, it would spoil where it's going.
00:09:38 There's going to be some reveals, and I want those reveals to be surprising and make people go, hmm.
00:09:48 You know what I mean?
00:09:49 Yes, I do know what you mean.
00:09:51 There's like, I have ideas for Belle Jape too, that I'm cooking right now.
00:09:58 Cooking, cooking.
00:10:00 Let me cook, as they say.
00:10:02 Let them cook.
00:10:04 And the larger, like for Belle Jape too, what happens is just stuff.
00:10:13 Like there's no huge revelations, but the idea that there are revelations is like, oh yeah.
00:10:20 I don't want anyone to know exactly what could happen, but it's not like one piece, right?
00:10:28 You know that the idea is that pirates are searching for treasure.
00:10:32 Obviously, the end of the thing is going to be they find the treasure.
00:10:36 It's all of the things that happen in between that is like, are they going to make it through this obstacle on the way to their ultimate goal?
00:10:44 Yeah, is this guy going to join the crew?
00:10:46 Is that guy going to join the crew?
00:10:48 Yeah, and it's like the journey is what's interesting and the ultimate goal of like, you know, will they find the treasure?
00:10:57 You know that there is a treasure that is not aimless.
00:11:00 I think in Belle Jape, they're sort of aimless.
00:11:03 And so I should reveal some sort of a goal, but I don't want to show my hand as to all the lore that I've been building up.
00:11:10 I don't want to have like a, I want to have it like come out in a sort of, I can't think of words.
00:11:22 This is why I'm a writer.
00:11:27 To be revealed at a pace where each, if you take the whole thing, each individual part of the lore, part of the story is not interesting necessarily all by itself.
00:11:43 But if you know everything, like if you know the big secrets, the smaller secrets aren't as interesting, but you want to start with the smaller secrets because they'll be like, oh, interesting.
00:11:52 I didn't know that.
00:11:53 And then you like, and then it causes more questions.
00:11:57 I'm really explaining this badly, but you know, you know,
00:12:04 You lost me a little bit.
00:12:06 I mean, I get to start with the small stuff and build to the big reveals.
00:12:10 That makes sense.
00:12:11 Start with the small stuff, build the big reveals.
00:12:15 Nah, I honestly have lost myself.
00:12:18 I don't know where I was going.
00:12:20 I was trying to relate to you as an artist.
00:12:25 I couldn't do it.
00:12:26 Impossible.
00:12:29 I'm not a real artist.
00:12:30 I'm just pretending.
00:12:32 All this art that I'm making, fake.
00:12:34 It's me.
00:12:35 It's mere artifice, actually.
00:12:39 You there?
00:12:40 Yeah.
00:12:41 I don't know why I'm out of breath.
00:12:43 Is it COVID?
00:12:45 No.
00:12:46 That's my first thought.
00:12:47 That's my first thought is it's COVID.
00:12:51 I don't know.
00:12:52 Maybe it's just the room is stuffy.
00:12:53 I'm going to open a window.
00:12:54 It's cold, but like, it's not that cold.
00:12:57 It's the sun's shining.
00:12:58 I'll be in a second.
00:13:04 Sorry.
00:13:05 Did I talk last week about my licorice experiments?
00:13:08 You did.
00:13:09 Well, they've continued.
00:13:11 I continue, I continue to get a result that is either too,
00:13:18 too soft and chewy, like an airhead,
00:13:21 or too stiff and almost like if you chill it in the fridge,
00:13:26 you can actually snap it into like a hard candy.
00:13:30 So I continue to, I think the missing ingredient might be
00:13:36 like palm oil or palm kernel oil.
00:13:38 I think that might be what lets it get so dense and chewy,
00:13:43 but not hard and crunchy.
00:13:46 So I might have to get, or maybe glycerin.
00:13:48 So I might have to get some of that and fuck around.
00:13:51 I'm getting closer.
00:13:52 I made one yesterday that was pretty close.
00:13:54 It was pretty close to a Twizzler.
00:13:56 It was just a little too firm and you kind of had to melt it
00:14:01 in your mouth for a minute before you could chew on it,
00:14:03 but it was like 85% there.
00:14:06 And that was pretty cool.
00:14:08 That was, that was pretty exciting.
00:14:10 I would like to make a licorice flavored one.
00:14:12 I'm going to get some, some licorice extract.
00:14:16 And I got that, I got that the ammonium chloride.
00:14:19 I got the salomonia, which apparently is used
00:14:25 in licorice flavoring sometimes.
00:14:28 I tried tasting it.
00:14:29 I put a little bit on my finger and I tasted it
00:14:31 and it was a little bit painful.
00:14:33 It hurt my tongue a little bit.
00:14:35 So don't.
00:14:37 That's the right stuff.
00:14:38 It's like, that's, that's how you know.
00:14:40 It's got the, it really packs a punch.
00:14:43 Yeah, it tastes, tastes weird, weirdly enough,
00:14:48 just putting a weird powder on my tongue tasted pretty bad
00:14:51 all by itself.
00:14:52 So, but you know, yeah, it's just a little surprising.
00:14:56 That's all I have to say about that.
00:15:03 It's fun.
00:15:04 I like making various goose in the kitchen.
00:15:08 Hell.
00:15:09 That is good.
00:15:10 Hell fucking yeah.
00:15:15 Sorry, it is, it is just sort of like stuffy in my room.
00:15:20 There's no oxygen here.
00:15:23 Even though you open the window.
00:15:24 Now don't worry everybody.
00:15:25 There is a carbon monoxide detector.
00:15:28 It would be going haywire and it cut, cut, cut to the thing
00:15:32 with no batteries are working.
00:15:34 It's not working.
00:15:35 That's, that's Chekhov's, that's Chekhov's.
00:15:38 Chekhov's carbon monoxide detector.
00:15:41 Chekhov's depleted batteries in the carbon monoxide detector.
00:15:44 Yeah.
00:15:45 Okay.
00:15:46 Chekhov's gun, Chekhov's bullet currently flying through the air.
00:15:50 I have, I have a horror story from this week to share with you.
00:15:56 Do you want to hear the worst thing ever?
00:16:00 I don't know.
00:16:01 It sounds pretty bad.
00:16:03 You know how in, you know how in Beescapades, the beast hustler
00:16:07 occasionally learns baleful secrets.
00:16:10 That's what you're about to hear.
00:16:12 Oh no.
00:16:13 No.
00:16:14 Okay.
00:16:15 This is so fucked up.
00:16:16 I can't believe, I can't believe I have to say this.
00:16:18 I can't believe this is my life.
00:16:21 One of my roommates has seen my videos.
00:16:29 He like knows who I am.
00:16:31 Oh dear.
00:16:32 Yeah.
00:16:33 That's the price you pay for making a big Mega Man lecture.
00:16:37 Yeah.
00:16:38 He came to my room the other day and he asked me if he could use my printer
00:16:41 and I was like, yeah, sure.
00:16:43 And he was wearing a Mega Man shirt and I was like, nice shirt.
00:16:46 And he was like, yeah, cool.
00:16:48 And then he said, he cosplayed as Mega Man at PAX East like last week
00:16:53 and I was like, lol.
00:16:55 And then he asked me about my like setup.
00:16:58 He asked me about my dual monitor setup and my tablet.
00:17:02 And he was like, are you an artist?
00:17:04 And I was like, yeah.
00:17:05 And then he asked me like, what do you do?
00:17:07 And I was like, oh, I make comics and I make YouTube videos sometimes.
00:17:09 And he was like, do you make like long form content?
00:17:13 And I was like, yeah, yeah.
00:17:15 And he was like, I think I might have seen your video.
00:17:18 I was like, no, no.
00:17:21 So it was only like a, like he wasn't familiar enough with the video.
00:17:25 Okay.
00:17:26 And you in it to know instantly that it was you.
00:17:29 He, yeah.
00:17:31 But he has seen it?
00:17:33 He didn't explicitly say he'd watch the video.
00:17:36 I think he might have.
00:17:37 I'm not sure, but he pulled it up YouTube and he showed me the thumbnail of the Mega Man video.
00:17:41 He was like, is that you?
00:17:42 I was like, yeah, that's me.
00:17:44 And he spat at you.
00:17:50 He slammed the door in your face.
00:17:53 Okay.
00:17:54 So I was surprised by that, but I was more surprised by what happened next because he asked, you know,
00:18:01 I was trying to print a document for him and he asked me like if I was making any new videos.
00:18:06 And I told him, like, yeah, I'm kind of working on, I want to do a battle network follow up,
00:18:12 but I have to play the games first.
00:18:14 So in the meantime, I thought I was going to do a history video about the history of this podcast I'm on.
00:18:19 And he was like, oh, you mean the, uh, the, uh, the procrastinators.
00:18:23 And I was like, I can't fucking believe you know what that is.
00:18:27 This is a nightmare.
00:18:29 Wait, wait.
00:18:30 Did they, how did he learn, did he learn about the Mega Man first and then the procrastinators?
00:18:35 Or is it unrelated?
00:18:37 I think so.
00:18:38 I think he might know that just because I mentioned the procrastinators in the Mega Man video,
00:18:44 I think that might be why he knows what it, which is.
00:18:46 You do that right at the beginning, right?
00:18:48 Yeah.
00:18:49 I'm surprised he would retain that information unless he was familiar with it.
00:18:54 But I mean, yeah, that's probably where he learned it from.
00:18:58 But like, I don't know, terrible, just, just terrible.
00:19:02 I don't know this guy.
00:19:03 This is a total stranger.
00:19:04 I've been living with him for six months.
00:19:06 He knows my YouTube channel.
00:19:07 He knows about my podcast.
00:19:09 He's at the door right now listening.
00:19:11 I'm going to, I'm going to die.
00:19:12 I'm going, I'm going, I'm not going to make it.
00:19:14 This is it.
00:19:15 This is it.
00:19:16 Some toast.
00:19:18 It's over.
00:19:19 Do you think, I mean, what was the, what was the body language expression?
00:19:24 Was he excited by this revelation that he was living with a YouTuber?
00:19:29 Oh, he was ecstatic.
00:19:30 No.
00:19:31 I mean, he was, he was just surprised.
00:19:32 He was just kind of like, wow, I can't believe I've seen your videos.
00:19:36 And I was like, yeah, I can't believe you've seen that either.
00:19:40 Oh, he asked me, he asked me if I made one about Kingdom Hearts.
00:19:44 And I was like, no, that was my brother, Lamal.
00:19:47 And he had, he had seen, he had seen the Animorphs one, but not the, um, oh no, he was, because
00:19:54 he'd seen the other lectures when he knew about the procrastinators because he'd seen
00:19:57 at least some of the other lectures.
00:19:58 He'd seen the Kingdom Hearts one and he'd seen not the Guilty Gear one, but he'd seen
00:20:03 the, the Animorphs one.
00:20:06 How fucked up?
00:20:07 How fucked up is that?
00:20:08 I mean, I, it's, it's not that fucked up.
00:20:13 No, shut up.
00:20:14 No, shut up.
00:20:15 It's fucked up.
00:20:16 It's so fucked up.
00:20:18 You put those lectures out to be seen by thousands and thousands of people.
00:20:22 No, I did not.
00:20:25 I didn't, I didn't ask for this.
00:20:30 Do you think he's going to listen to the podcast now?
00:20:33 Do you think, do you think he knows?
00:20:35 No.
00:20:36 Or is he just not going to be that interested?
00:20:38 I, I sincerely, I mean, that's a big leap.
00:20:41 That, that's a big leap from, I've seen a couple of the posts you made on YouTube too.
00:20:47 I'm going to become a regular listener of your podcast.
00:20:51 I, I would, I would sincerely doubt it.
00:20:54 Unless he's like, what if, what if he feels like, unless he has like a morbid curiosity,
00:20:57 which would, yeah, he might have morbid curiosity.
00:20:59 I wonder if, I wonder if that Ben guy like shit talked me on the podcast that he does.
00:21:05 Sam, go to hell.
00:21:07 Don't listen to that.
00:21:08 I hate you.
00:21:09 You shouldn't be hearing this right now.
00:21:11 This is a betrayal.
00:21:14 That guy's fine.
00:21:15 He's my, he's my, he's the, I would say of the current crop of roommates that he's the only one.
00:21:20 He's pretty much the only one that has not annoyed me at all.
00:21:24 None of my roommates are that bad or even particularly bad at all.
00:21:28 But you know, once in a while I'll have a little annoyance with one of them.
00:21:33 This is, this is the least he's the least annoying of a mostly not very annoying group.
00:21:39 So until now, until now.
00:21:42 Yeah.
00:21:43 This is the sin of watching your YouTube videos that you post publicly.
00:21:47 Yeah.
00:21:48 That's terrible.
00:21:49 I really, I really resent that.
00:21:52 Anyway, that was a nightmare.
00:21:54 Yeah.
00:21:55 I know.
00:21:56 I can imagine.
00:21:57 It's over.
00:21:58 But like if somebody, if somebody knew, it's like the same feeling I get when I remember
00:22:02 that my mom follows my Twitter and I'm like, oh, mom.
00:22:07 Does she follow big girl squish?
00:22:09 No, she has no idea.
00:22:10 Okay.
00:22:11 That's, that's a lot of the reason why I don't do that stuff on my main.
00:22:15 I see.
00:22:16 I see.
00:22:17 Even though I do post like weird stuff on my main.
00:22:21 So it's still, I guess she reads it, but she doesn't use Twitter.
00:22:25 Yeah.
00:22:26 Just every so often.
00:22:27 Yeah.
00:22:28 But still it's like, oh God, I know that's who I really am, but I don't want you to know.
00:22:31 About it.
00:22:32 Yeah.
00:22:33 Um, I remember, um, I remember like Nate said that like a kid at like his school like
00:22:44 knew about a best guy ever.
00:22:46 He got recognized by like a kid in a class with him or something.
00:22:51 And one time, uh, I remember when I was living in Georgia at a party, there was a guy who
00:22:58 came over to my house and he was just a friend of a friend who didn't had never met me.
00:23:03 And he was like, are you that son of a shoe guy?
00:23:06 And I was like, yeah, that's me.
00:23:08 Uh, and now it's, it's happened again and he's my fucking roommate.
00:23:11 And he lives in my house.
00:23:14 Terrible.
00:23:15 Wait, what was the thing with a Nate in the classroom?
00:23:17 I just, I feel like I remember that Nate said that he was going to like a college class
00:23:24 and a kid in the class with him like recognized him as best guy ever.
00:23:29 Oh, so it's, hmm.
00:23:32 Wonder when that would have been.
00:23:34 I don't remember Nate talking about going to a college thing.
00:23:37 What?
00:23:38 I think he was still doing, or he, or he was like doing like, he was like finishing school.
00:23:45 Oh, that's right.
00:23:46 He had some sort of school thing.
00:23:48 And yeah, he had to like complete his degree.
00:23:52 Yeah.
00:23:53 Yeah.
00:23:54 That was must have been like five, would have been like five years ago, I think, four or
00:23:58 five years ago, maybe more.
00:24:00 Crazy.
00:24:01 Yeah.
00:24:02 Um, so, you know, very strange, very, very strange.
00:24:08 Oh shit.
00:24:09 Speaking of, hang on, I need to check a number, but I think this year is my, my 10 year anniversary
00:24:16 of having posted videos on the internet.
00:24:19 Uh-oh.
00:24:22 As Gibb and take as like the pony.
00:24:26 Yeah.
00:24:27 Yeah.
00:24:28 As the pony.
00:24:29 This December, 10 year anniversary of my first Gibb and take analysis video.
00:24:33 That's what it is.
00:24:34 So it'll be 10 years in December.
00:24:38 Wait.
00:24:39 Since I first made my analysis assemblage in fucking, I guess 2013.
00:24:45 Hang on.
00:24:46 Hang on.
00:24:47 My first TBAP in like 2014.
00:24:52 I don't, I mean, there was my little pony season three and then season four and you started
00:24:57 on season four.
00:24:58 And maybe you're thinking of that, but it would have been, yeah, I think I, my first
00:25:03 video was like December 13th.
00:25:05 So it was right at the end.
00:25:07 2013.
00:25:08 Oh my God.
00:25:09 It was nine years ago.
00:25:10 Wait, wait, wait.
00:25:11 Okay.
00:25:12 Wait.
00:25:13 Oh no, it was the end of 2013.
00:25:14 Yeah.
00:25:15 Yeah.
00:25:16 The first, the first TBAP was, yeah, December 9th, 2013.
00:25:20 Which means it's coming up on, on the 10 year anniversary of the horseshoe crew.
00:25:26 Jesus fuck.
00:25:27 Cause that wasn't that much longer.
00:25:29 Yeah.
00:25:30 Yeah.
00:25:31 You're right.
00:25:32 It would have been sometimes in the next year.
00:25:34 Oh my God.
00:25:36 Well, perfect time for a PCP retrospective by yours truly.
00:25:45 Are you doing that?
00:25:46 Are you doing like a lecture about that?
00:25:47 People have been saying you should do that.
00:25:49 Oh, have I, have I not mentioned it on the, yeah, I said it in my Patreon podcast.
00:25:53 I, yeah, I think I'm probably going to do a lecture about the history of the PCP.
00:26:00 Yeah.
00:26:01 I think that's the plan.
00:26:02 Are you going to try and keep it like bio-free, spite-free?
00:26:05 Yeah.
00:26:06 Okay.
00:26:07 I'm not going to, you know, like a historical.
00:26:12 It's, it's, you know, I can't, I can't say it's impossible to, to do anything completely
00:26:17 bias-free, but like, yeah, my goal will be to recount the history more or less factually.
00:26:23 You know, I might, I might let an opinion slip in here and there, but no, the goal, the
00:26:31 goal will be to like, if you don't know what the PCP is, here's, here's what it was and
00:26:37 what it is now and the, the story of how it happened.
00:26:40 You know, it's, it's, it's meant to be genuinely educational for someone who, because I mean,
00:26:45 a lot of people that have started following, there are a lot of people who have started
00:26:49 listening to the PCP, believe it or not, like post pony and then like post rad con.
00:26:56 There, there's people who still find it through like the Mega Man lecture, for instance.
00:27:01 Yeah.
00:27:02 That's, and those people need to be brought up to speed.
00:27:07 They need to be brought to justice.
00:27:09 They need to be, they need to be stopped at any cost.
00:27:12 Yeah.
00:27:13 Uh, so, yeah, I think that's what I'm going to do.
00:27:19 Uh, as soon as this freaking comic is done, as soon as this freaking periodical is published,
00:27:26 uh, that'll be my next, it'll be my next priority after the perfect comic party is.
00:27:32 I've got to, yeah.
00:27:35 Uh, I mean, I want to get ahead on Clarissa chapter five just because it will take probably
00:27:42 a little longer.
00:27:44 Well, I want to be, I want to give myself plenty of room to like fuck up a bit so that when
00:27:51 it's next month, we're not pushing it back.
00:27:54 Yeah.
00:27:55 Um, but yeah, I haven't done any of the other things like the, the contents page or whatever.
00:28:00 Um, I, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm working on my pages.
00:28:04 So, I mean, if you, if you've got time and you want to, you know, uh, do some like layout
00:28:10 stuff on some of those pages, you know, it would be, uh, helpful.
00:28:15 But, uh, you know, I'm going to, I'm going to keep getting my stuff done and, uh, and
00:28:20 then we'll, you know, we'll see what, what has yet to be finished when, when I'm through
00:28:24 with that.
00:28:25 Uh, uh, we need, um, I don't know.
00:28:30 I don't know if you want to do anything fancy for like page layout.
00:28:33 We can, we can always, we can, we can, we can always get fancier later.
00:28:38 We can.
00:28:39 I'm notoriously bad at choosing fonts.
00:28:42 I hate typefaces because there's so many of them.
00:28:45 I mean, I like them, but there's all, there's too many and I never know which one to pick.
00:28:50 And so I always end up using many different ones and it's just not, it's never cohesive.
00:28:56 And I'm like, uh, if only I knew about 7,000 different fonts that I could choose from, but
00:29:03 I only know these ones.
00:29:04 We should use the defaults.
00:29:06 Well, since we're, since this is a comic publication, we should use a font designed for comics.
00:29:13 The Garfield font.
00:29:15 I was going to say comic sans.
00:29:17 Uh, there's the anime ace that comes with like Clip Studio.
00:29:23 Yeah.
00:29:24 I mean.
00:29:25 And I think, I think that for like a letter from the editor, I feel like a pretty, like
00:29:32 a pretty normal freaking career.
00:29:36 Honestly, courier.
00:29:38 No.
00:29:39 Well, maybe, maybe, maybe bold courier.
00:29:41 I mean, I was just going for a letter from the editor.
00:29:44 I was going to say like fucking Times New Roman.
00:29:47 Uh, is that boring?
00:29:48 I mean, I'm sorry.
00:29:49 Sorry.
00:29:50 Sorry.
00:29:51 That's not quirky enough.
00:29:52 But like the, like a normal font with it is normal.
00:29:57 Ariel's pretty normal.
00:29:58 Times New Roman just, it feels, although it is a newspaper font, I guess it would fit.
00:30:06 I mean, for something like a letter from the editor, I feel like the font should be more
00:30:10 or less invisible.
00:30:11 Uh, shouldn't, shouldn't draw attention to itself.
00:30:14 No.
00:30:15 Yeah.
00:30:16 Yeah.
00:30:17 Um, maybe, maybe something like, uh, well, hang on.
00:30:21 Well, hang on.
00:30:22 Let me, let me, out.
00:30:24 Are we gonna go font th Haven.
00:30:26 Yeah.
00:30:27 Yeah.
00:30:28 Yeah.
00:30:29 Yeah.
00:30:30 We're doing this.
00:30:31 We're doing it.
00:30:32 Um, all right.
00:30:33 What we got?
00:30:34 We got courier new de chavoux, uh, cracked Johnny.
00:30:39 Oh, yeah.
00:30:40 That's a winner, uh, oh doc Champa.
00:30:43 Oh, what the hell, uh, ethnocentric sounds good.
00:30:50 Fighting spirit. I've never even heard of any of these.
00:30:54 Bonshrift is a good one.
00:30:57 Bonshrift.
00:30:59 No, Bonshrift, like German, B, A, H, N.
00:31:03 Bonshrift. Yeah.
00:31:06 Pretty good. I use that, I think, for Clarissa Gunsmoke book.
00:31:12 Honestly, Calibri.
00:31:16 And that's all websites use that.
00:31:18 Wait, what's Calibri?
00:31:19 What's Calibri look like?
00:31:21 Oh, this is pretty normal.
00:31:23 Yeah, something like Calibri would be fine.
00:31:25 Yeah.
00:31:27 I mean, you know, we can get we can get a little funky with
00:31:32 what about Karima, you know, Karima?
00:31:37 You'll know, you'll know what it is if I tell you.
00:31:41 Oh, the fucking.
00:31:43 The like Tim Burton kind of looking.
00:31:46 Wait, no, that's the death note.
00:31:48 Is it?
00:31:49 No, Karima is the it's the font.
00:31:52 It's the prospect and derse like titles.
00:31:54 It is. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:31:56 Of course, I have that font block.
00:31:58 That one's pretty good.
00:31:59 We should use Karima.
00:32:02 Karima is a good, good meme, good meme.
00:32:04 Yeah, prospect, derse, who's who?
00:32:07 I think I'm Derse.
00:32:09 I mean, yeah, you got the color palette for it, I guess.
00:32:11 Yeah.
00:32:12 I always liked how
00:32:14 Prospect is not just the good characters on in Homestuck,
00:32:17 like risk is on Prospect.
00:32:21 Yeah, I mean.
00:32:23 Gamsie as well.
00:32:24 There's not.
00:32:25 There's not really any like real.
00:32:29 There doesn't seem to be any real logic to like who's a
00:32:31 Prospect dreamer and who's a derse dreamer.
00:32:34 I mean, with the humans, it kind of is just because it's like,
00:32:38 oh, look, the sweet, innocent.
00:32:41 Idiots and nerds are on Prospect
00:32:43 and the edgy, rebellious, like we don't give a fuck.
00:32:47 Kids are on Derse.
00:32:49 It might also be because like they're related, like like like
00:32:52 Dave and Rosa are siblings sort of.
00:32:55 So maybe it's maybe it's their bloodline.
00:32:59 Probably not.
00:33:01 Yeah, they would be together either way.
00:33:03 But like, yeah, I think that's the idea of like, oh, John,
00:33:07 because we learn about all these things from the humans,
00:33:11 John and stuff.
00:33:11 And they'd like, oh, John's a good boy, Jade's a good girl.
00:33:15 They're on fucking Prospect.
00:33:18 Therefore, the dark one is the other ones.
00:33:22 True.
00:33:25 Oh, yeah.
00:33:25 But then with the trolls, it's not it's not really like that.
00:33:28 The trolls, it seems kind of pretty random.
00:33:30 I mean, I mean, I wonder if you could read stuff into it.
00:33:34 I don't really know.
00:33:35 I mean, I never tried.
00:33:37 Vriska is a light player.
00:33:39 So wait, but Rose is a light player.
00:33:41 And she's and she's a dirt streamer, so never mind.
00:33:46 There's probably some sort of Tumblr theory somewhere.
00:33:49 Yeah, I'm sure the guy I'm sure I'm sure a blade kind eye wear
00:33:53 who wrote all the articles about type inversion
00:33:57 probably has a I'm sure I'm sure.
00:33:59 Dersen Prospect dreaming ties into it somewhere.
00:34:04 Type inversion.
00:34:05 You mean like Karima.
00:34:07 Yeah, give.
00:34:09 Yeah.
00:34:11 Type inversion inverted to Cooper.
00:34:16 Let's see. All right.
00:34:17 Let's let's all right.
00:34:18 Karima, that's that's a winner.
00:34:22 Oh, Charlemagne.
00:34:23 Oh, yeah, Charlemagne STD.
00:34:27 And by STD, I mean standard.
00:34:30 Oh, ethnocentric again.
00:34:31 Why do I keep seeing that?
00:34:32 That's why do you have those?
00:34:34 I don't know.
00:34:34 I don't know.
00:34:35 I didn't I didn't.
00:34:36 I must have downloaded a pack or something.
00:34:39 Silphane is my favorite like normal looking font.
00:34:42 I don't exactly know what's different.
00:34:44 It looks like Times New Roman, but it's not Times New Roman.
00:34:49 Franklin Gothic medium.
00:34:51 Oovani.
00:34:52 Oh, yeah, font script.
00:34:54 Be feel free to look up all these things we're saying at home
00:34:58 and be like, oh, yeah, I like that.
00:35:00 Eleazar, Eleazar, throw up.
00:35:01 Eleazar, throw up images of all these fonts as we would cut a whimsy
00:35:07 Waverly, Vrinda, go, go, go.
00:35:09 No, no, no, no.
00:35:10 Oh, Hope Gold.
00:35:12 That's that's something I got from.
00:35:14 That's Homestuck.
00:35:15 No, well, yeah, it is a Homestuck looking.
00:35:19 I forget where I think I got it from like a pack of fonts from.
00:35:24 What's itch here?
00:35:25 Itch.io.
00:35:30 OK, I mean, whatever.
00:35:32 Fucking we don't really need to get we don't really need to get that weird with it.
00:35:39 You know, for like letter from the editor page, a patron, thank you page.
00:35:43 But now I'm thinking of like Prospect and Duris.
00:35:46 We should have our own Prospect and Duris and you're the Duris.
00:35:49 I am the Prospect.
00:35:50 And that's how we slice the editor page in half.
00:35:53 OK, sure.
00:35:55 Yeah, but yeah, let's just let's let's just do that for no reason.
00:36:00 Let's just do it.
00:36:01 What if there are two things and they had a line in the middle
00:36:05 and they were different just like that thing that remember those images
00:36:09 with the pony smiling and then angry on the other side.
00:36:12 Oh, sure.
00:36:13 I can be your angle or your devil.
00:36:16 Yes. Yeah.
00:36:17 That's that can only be done with two people.
00:36:20 True. We should lean into who is the angle?
00:36:23 Who is the devil?
00:36:24 We should lean into the fact that there's two of us.
00:36:28 That's like our that's like our bit.
00:36:30 That's like our thing.
00:36:31 Yeah, what's what's our gimmick?
00:36:33 Well, there's two of them.
00:36:38 Maybe on the maybe on the submissions page.
00:36:43 Biblically, biblically accurate, give sorry.
00:36:46 So I was thinking angle and devil biblically accurate, give I.
00:36:51 OK, I'm thinking about submissions.
00:36:55 And I'm thinking how are we just going to have people like send an email?
00:37:02 I want I just I want people to have to like click a box or something.
00:37:06 Maybe maybe we'll have a form.
00:37:07 I think maybe we'll have like a form that you can fill out that's like
00:37:10 your name, the name of your submission.
00:37:13 I think I think I took some notes here.
00:37:14 I wrote down some crap.
00:37:19 Let me let me get my document.
00:37:21 I wrote down some notes make a specific email for it.
00:37:24 I think there should be a form and you should have to include this filled out
00:37:28 form with your submission.
00:37:31 And it would just be things like, you know, you you you agree that like,
00:37:35 you know, you own all the relevant copyrights to all the content you're
00:37:38 submitting, you know, you you grant us permission to feature your content on,
00:37:41 you know, digitally and archive it.
00:37:44 And this.
00:37:48 Let's see, sir.
00:37:50 Yeah, methods of contacting you just is is the is the work already
00:37:54 published on some other site, you know, include links to where it's published.
00:37:58 If so, is it based?
00:38:00 Is it cring check a box?
00:38:02 Check. Is it a dirt?
00:38:03 Is it a dirt streamer?
00:38:04 Is it a prospect dreamer?
00:38:07 And I think that's pretty much there is a prospect.
00:38:09 We'll have to come up with our own names for these stupid things.
00:38:13 I want this and.
00:38:15 Uh, poor, I can't think or bus.
00:38:19 I porpoise porpoise porpoise like a dolphin.
00:38:23 Yeah, I just think, you know, we should this.
00:38:28 This when you submit your thing, you should have to submit it along with a
00:38:31 thing that's like, you know, acknowledging I grant, you know, I affirm
00:38:37 that I am not stealing this content and it is mine to submit.
00:38:41 And I am I, the copyright holder, am granting you permission to feature
00:38:45 it in the thing and, uh, you know, it's not it's my fault.
00:38:50 If this turns out to be stolen, it's not your fault.
00:38:54 I assume all liabilities therein.
00:38:57 You know, uh, so we'll probably just have like a link to a page on the website
00:39:05 that has the form and it's like download the form, fill it out, send us an
00:39:09 email with the form attached, set the, the, the, the, the email, uh, we'll
00:39:15 have a certain include a certain something in the subject line that's
00:39:18 like perfect comic party submission, name of submission.
00:39:22 And that's, and that'll be how you submit.
00:39:24 I feel like that's probably the easiest way to do it.
00:39:26 Um, sure.
00:39:28 I think it's like a Google forms thing.
00:39:31 Oh, they can like automate that instead of having them download an image, you
00:39:36 know, yeah, there probably is like cheesy uses Google forms to like do pre-orders.
00:39:43 Yeah, I think that would be, yeah, that's probably making it a lot easier
00:39:46 for the, for everyone.
00:39:48 Yeah, I've never, I've never used that, but you're right.
00:39:50 That probably would be easier.
00:39:53 That's probably easier.
00:39:54 Okay.
00:39:54 Well, maybe we'll do it.
00:39:55 Maybe we'll do it like that.
00:39:57 Um, but, you know, we'll have a page being like submit your comic.
00:40:02 Maybe we'll feature it in the next issue.
00:40:04 Um, and that's pretty, and that's pretty much it.
00:40:06 And then maybe in the second issue onward, we will have another page for
00:40:09 like, you know, reader response where like readers can like write us a letter
00:40:14 or something or write us an email or maybe even just like add us on Twitter
00:40:18 or something and we'll, we respond to those feature of Q and a page or something.
00:40:26 And that'll be, but that's, we don't have those for the first one.
00:40:30 Oh, and like a link to like on the thank you page be like, you know,
00:40:34 support us on cofire, patreon and get your name featured.
00:40:37 And yeah, yeah.
00:40:39 What if, what if all the submissions are bad?
00:40:43 What if everything sucks?
00:40:46 Then we put a red man comic in its place.
00:40:50 Yeah.
00:40:51 Okay.
00:40:52 Okay.
00:40:53 Yeah.
00:40:54 If there's no, we're not like guaranteeing people be on the comic.
00:40:58 We are just sort of like, we are publishers now.
00:41:03 Yeah.
00:41:04 You must be good enough or we will smite you down.
00:41:07 Yeah.
00:41:08 But that's not like a nice thing to say.
00:41:10 So we'll say, no, no, no, no, no, this is good.
00:41:12 This is good.
00:41:13 We should include that as a clause in the form like check the box.
00:41:16 You will be smote if your stuff is not, it's not good.
00:41:20 Uh, you know.
00:41:22 I like the idea of encouraging people to draw if they haven't tried to draw
00:41:26 like a comic before and they just want to start and it's like a good thing to
00:41:29 like a good reason to try.
00:41:30 Yeah.
00:41:31 Um, but yeah, the, I don't know, there will be, there will be possibility
00:41:37 of destruction that comes with that.
00:41:40 I, I, you know, I don't, I don't require that everything be like drawn by a,
00:41:47 you know, a professional draftsman.
00:41:49 I don't, I don't require like everything be executed at the highest level.
00:41:54 No.
00:41:54 But I'd only feature something if I thought it was good and had some quality
00:41:59 to it, some kind of hook to it, something to latch onto to be like, oh,
00:42:03 this is a good comic.
00:42:04 It has such and such going for it.
00:42:06 And if the, and if the submissions don't meet a certain level of that,
00:42:11 then, uh, we just won't feature any stuff and it'll just be you and me.
00:42:16 Yeah.
00:42:17 And that's, and that's okay.
00:42:19 We can have a thing as well.
00:42:20 If we disagree on a submission, you don't like it.
00:42:23 I do.
00:42:23 Or the other way around, uh, we can have it as like a Gibb pick or a Ben pick.
00:42:28 Sure.
00:42:28 So, so that the other is not, um, not, yeah, not liable, not, no, no blame.
00:42:35 Okay.
00:42:36 It's like Gibb endorses this, this comic.
00:42:39 Ben withholds his endorsements.
00:42:44 Well, I think, well, I think we should.
00:42:47 I'm thinking maybe like, maybe like once a month, like after, if we get, if we get
00:42:53 into like a monthly release schedule, maybe once a month, like the PCP of that
00:42:58 week is like, it's the perfect comic party episode of the procrastinators
00:43:02 podcast where we talk about the content.
00:43:06 So wait, PCP episode, something PCP episode one.
00:43:10 That's right.
00:43:13 Correct.
00:43:14 It's, it's, it's the PCP.
00:43:17 PCP.
00:43:17 It's the PCP.
00:43:19 PCP.
00:43:20 PCP PCP.
00:43:22 It's the perfect comic party procrastinators podcast.
00:43:26 One.
00:43:29 So PCP, PCP, PCP, PCP, PCP.
00:43:34 It's, it's, it's PC, it'll be PCP three, five, six, PCP one.
00:43:40 Perfect.
00:43:41 Perfect procrastinators podcast episode three, fifty six, perfect comic party episode
00:43:45 one and I'll be the subject line and and and like cowboys or something.
00:43:50 You know.
00:43:51 Yeah.
00:43:53 I like the idea of it being like episode one of a different podcast
00:43:57 called the PCP, PCP, PCP is not PCP, PCP, PCP, PCP, PCP episode one.
00:44:10 And then in small writing like procrastinated podcast episode number just so just so people know the number like
00:44:18 It's a different show. It's exactly the same show and it looks like that's the same show, but it's about a comic
00:44:26 Right, I mean a naming convention is fucked. It's funny. I mean it's still a podcast
00:44:30 It's just on this episode of the podcast. We will be discussing the comic the the the cut the comic. That's that's my idea
00:44:39 And then I thought I don't know if we if we feature certain artists, maybe we
00:44:45 We might have some of them as guests and like talk about their submissions. Maybe I don't know
00:44:50 If they're if you'll be a more of a themed episode. Yeah, and that's good. Yeah. Yeah
00:45:00 Well, but but but you know good good good comics only please good comics only, okay
00:45:07 It's an amateur amateur hour. It's an amateur hour. All right. This is serious business
00:45:13 You the the viewer listener will do not know what good comics means. So just submit anyway, and then
00:45:19 You know find out fuck around and find out. Yeah, please. Yeah, please. That's the that's how you do life. You'll know
00:45:25 You'll you'll know
00:45:28 You will find out. Yeah, that's good. I yeah, you're encouraged to fuck around
00:45:36 Okay, well, I I
00:45:38 Don't know if I can get all of Biscopades done this week, but maybe and probably by next week
00:45:44 I feel like I can crank out another
00:45:47 12 pages
00:45:48 12 pages. I mean, I mean, like you said, I guess it's not that hard to draw. It's it's mostly um
00:45:56 Yeah, just thinking about stuff
00:46:00 The it's fucking around with the layouts and
00:46:04 And uh, just like
00:46:06 Getting it on to like a page because I'm still kind of figuring out like how to arrange it in page format
00:46:12 I kind of miss the gifs. I actually really miss the animated gifs
00:46:16 Uh, there's like a bunch of panels so far that I'm like, I wish I could just animate this
00:46:21 Hmm
00:46:23 Do you think you would make it gif version for your website?
00:46:27 Yeah, yeah, some parts some parts I I might go back and gifify them
00:46:32 Do you think all right, here's a
00:46:34 Suggestion because I know how it feels to have to go back to something and you never get around to it
00:46:39 Do you think it would be better to make the gif version?
00:46:43 While you're making it so that you're you know, the idea of how the motion goes
00:46:48 Then exists and can be put on your site whenever
00:46:52 And then you just take a still from it to put in the the the perfect comic party because
00:46:57 When I feel like oh
00:47:00 Yeah, I'll do that later for lots of things but in it definitely with comics
00:47:05 And stories writing lore and stuff. I'm like, yeah, I'll like I'll elaborate on that later
00:47:10 I'll I'll do that later and then I come back to and I'm like, I don't really remember what I was thinking
00:47:15 Yeah, oh no, I can't make it now. It's gone. You know
00:47:19 Maybe you're right
00:47:21 But I kind of thought of that and I thought yeah, I sort of wish I could animate it
00:47:26 But like if I just have to accept well, I can't
00:47:29 So I'll just do it
00:47:31 in a in a static image and just just make it the best static image I can
00:47:36 and
00:47:38 Part of me is like I'll come back. I should come back and animate this later
00:47:41 But on the other maybe I should just resist that urge and just accept that like, you know what this this is a comic of static images now
00:47:48 So I'll just draw it as static images
00:47:51 And I can I can I can tell myself. Oh, I'll come back and animate it later as cope
00:47:56 But it's maybe it's better to just accept that like
00:48:00 This this is the form it's in now, but the the gifts were good. They were they were good
00:48:07 Some of them were good
00:48:08 yeah
00:48:10 I know but like
00:48:12 Is it worth is it worth
00:48:15 the stress of having to be like
00:48:17 Keep it in my head. I must come back to this and I must
00:48:21 Well, that's why I'm suggesting. Yeah, like take a little longer with it and then maybe make less pages, but then get the gifts ready
00:48:32 There are
00:48:34 I think people would appreciate the gifts
00:48:37 If and and would be happy if you took the time to make them
00:48:41 I mean I would I mean
00:48:44 uh
00:48:46 I don't know because it's like the people that are the people that read it in the perfect comic party are not
00:48:51 Going to then need to go to my website and read it on my website where they'll see the gifts. They'll they'll have already read it
00:48:57 So who is it for?
00:48:59 um, well, it's
00:49:02 I mean, okay. Here here's how it is, right? Bale jpe has gifts
00:49:08 Yeah, if I make a physical print version of bale jpe, which I probably will do at some point
00:49:13 um, well, it's I'll definitely do at some point because right now I can put it on amazon. There's no hassle, but
00:49:19 um
00:49:21 It's going to be static. I'm gonna have to un-giftify all these things. Yeah, and so
00:49:26 The reading experience is going to be different reading it physically than it is on the internet
00:49:33 uh for
00:49:34 so
00:49:35 There will be a reason to go to your website
00:49:37 Even though they have the perfect comic party because it's a different experience. It's it's an it's an additional
00:49:43 layer to the images that they can't get on the pdf. I
00:49:49 I I I get what you're saying
00:49:52 I just
00:49:54 That it's I get that
00:49:56 Are you
00:49:59 Okay, what's your angle here is your angle that the comic is just better with gifts because I don't disagree. I like the gifts
00:50:07 uh, I I mean, I think the
00:50:11 Uh for the for the fact that it needs to be
00:50:15 Uh, you know a singular document and you can't put gifts into a pdf
00:50:20 Then it's just like an unfortunate reality. If you could put gifts in a pdf
00:50:25 I would say make gifts and put them in the pdf. Yeah
00:50:28 Um, you can't print a gif obviously
00:50:31 And those are like limitations. I don't think
00:50:33 The biscuit page needs to now be limited because of one publication when the original
00:50:39 You know how as you would making it
00:50:41 Is so cool with the gifts. I don't think it needs to I don't think you need to like
00:50:47 To alter it permanently. I don't know. That's what I'm saying
00:50:53 I don't know. I I kind of think that like if I'm if I'm publishing biscuit page in the perfect comic party as a pdf
00:51:00 I should make it for that
00:51:02 format
00:51:05 I
00:51:06 Kind of feel like yeah, some of these images might look nice with a little bit of animation
00:51:13 But
00:51:15 It sort of feels like
00:51:18 It's putting effort in someplace that there's like little return
00:51:24 I can appreciate that I can I can appreciate
00:51:28 that like
00:51:29 It's more work, but like
00:51:32 I don't know
00:51:34 A lot of things are a lot of work
00:51:36 Phantom's revenge was a huge amount of work and that's really cool
00:51:40 Yes, but you can't put that but you can't put that video game in the book
00:51:44 I know but it wasn't made
00:51:46 Well, I I tried to translate it as best as I could to the book
00:51:49 But it wasn't made for a book. It was made as a game
00:51:53 But if biscuit page is made for a pdf
00:51:58 Then it's made for a pdf
00:52:00 and and
00:52:01 Maybe and I and I feel like the thing to do
00:52:05 Is to be like well, this is now a comic of static images. I'll make it out of static images
00:52:09 I
00:52:10 and
00:52:12 If I'm doing if I were to do the thing where I okay, I'll make static images for the thing
00:52:15 But then I'll make I'll gifify them for the website. It's like I'm making two
00:52:19 Different comic. I mean, that's not entirely true
00:52:23 I just feel like why re why make it twice
00:52:27 Uh, if I can just make it once and put it in one place so people can just read it there
00:52:32 I'm otherwise I'm like splitting the audience
00:52:35 Yeah, sort of
00:52:37 I don't think yeah, that was the thing
00:52:38 I don't think you're splitting the audience because people who read it in static form
00:52:43 Will be encouraged to go to your site to see it animated. Here's
00:52:47 I
00:52:48 I think
00:52:50 Most people are only going to want to read it once. I don't think most people
00:52:55 Who are going to read it on the thing are going to be like, oh, let me go see how it looks animated
00:52:59 I think they're going to read it once and and so I feel like it should just it should be in one one place
00:53:06 Uh, so in other words like go here. This is where to read it
00:53:11 I don't know. Um, it's
00:53:15 I mean commenters, let me know what you think
00:53:19 There are
00:53:20 Yeah, there are there there's a there's a there's a one particular there's one or two
00:53:25 Okay, in the old
00:53:27 Chapters of Beescapades, uh seeing the like the the shopkeepers behind their desk with a little like bobbling animation
00:53:33 I thought that was nice. I thought that was cute
00:53:35 Uh, and there's there's a couple of scenes in the new ones where things are like sparkling
00:53:41 And a little like and a little like shimmering sparkling animation. I think would have added a lot to it
00:53:47 But it can live it can I mean it it it it doesn't like ruin it that it doesn't have those things
00:53:55 And I guess it doesn't ruin it
00:53:58 But I still I'm gonna I'm gonna champion gififying or or making gifts first
00:54:04 And then static making you know making a taking a screenshot whatever
00:54:09 single frame because um, but
00:54:12 Yeah, I mean, you know my opinion now. Yeah, I mean, yeah
00:54:15 When you talk about like there's one place to go to see the thing
00:54:19 I was always thinking about
00:54:21 My comic in terms of like it it can like it'll be on my website for free
00:54:27 So therefore there's no reason it can't be on every comic hosting site. There is I just haven't gone around to all that
00:54:34 but um the idea is to get as many eyeballs in many different places as possible to read it wherever they are
00:54:41 so that then I can funnel them towards maybe being interested in buying the volume or
00:54:47 You know following my social media so they can keep track of new ones
00:54:50 And so it's like I think I see what you're getting at large large web and then all follow coming towards me
00:54:57 So that then I can say hey, did you like that comic you read on all those different websites or like one of many different websites?
00:55:04 You can buy it now and then more customers potentially you're saying
00:55:09 That even if I even if it's in the pcp in a non-gift form if I have it in gift form on my website
00:55:17 some people
00:55:18 Might check it out on my website as well. And that's a way to funnel an audience from
00:55:25 To my other stuff because they'll be yeah website. I mean that's that
00:55:29 That's true. That's it's not it's not it's not about like as well
00:55:34 It's like some people will only find it from your website because they'll go to your website from watching a youtube video
00:55:39 And they won't go to the pcp potentially and they won't find the perfect comic party
00:55:43 Like there's there's no reason for it to be all over the place
00:55:47 if it's online for free anyway, I
00:55:50 I don't think a substantial amount of people are going to discover Biscopades through my website. I just I just don't think that's gonna happen
00:55:58 Oh, how do the people discover your website like?
00:56:01 Through they they they find my website through my twitter or my youtube channel
00:56:06 Nobody finds me through my website
00:56:09 No, no, no what I mean is
00:56:11 Uh, they'll follow they'll see you make a man lecture. They'll see you do stuff. They'll go to your website
00:56:17 instead of
00:56:18 Going to the podcast
00:56:21 so if
00:56:23 I mean if you're gonna post it on your website anyway in non-gift form that would be fine, I guess
00:56:29 I just like the gifts
00:56:31 you know
00:56:33 I think
00:56:35 Maybe if I you know, uh, maybe if I just
00:56:39 Rain it in a little bit and just do very specific
00:56:43 gifts
00:56:45 for very very particular scenes
00:56:47 Just just in moments when I think it's like most appropriate just it would just take just one every here in there
00:56:53 uh
00:56:55 I mean when I used to post it on twitter
00:56:57 There was the limitation that I couldn't I would normally post it in like four image
00:57:03 Sets because a twitter lets you post four images at a time
00:57:06 But I couldn't post four gifts at a time if I had a gift I could only post one gift at a time
00:57:11 So it was kind of limited in that way. So already like most of the images were not gifts. Most of them were were pngs
00:57:18 um
00:57:20 Yeah, there's I'm thinking of one or two panels that I'm like that that could be
00:57:25 That could be a gift
00:57:26 uh, so
00:57:27 Yeah, I don't know maybe
00:57:29 I just um
00:57:32 You know, I really like to not
00:57:35 Create work for myself
00:57:38 True. No, I'm only saying I'm only uh sort of pressuring you because it's because you seem like you like the gifts
00:57:45 You wanted to keep them. I do
00:57:47 like them
00:57:49 I think I was a little bit
00:57:52 I think the I mean it was kind of part of the format of
00:57:56 Biscopades the first time
00:57:59 Is like
00:58:00 It's sort of made to be that I can like simply like make these somewhat simple assets
00:58:05 And put them together into an image and and animate them lightly
00:58:10 And that was kind of like the mission statement of Biscopades, although I don't know it's not like key to the story or anything
00:58:15 It was just a format thing
00:58:17 uh, you know if Biscopades is
00:58:22 on the
00:58:24 In a pdf form then, you know, it just has to it has to lose that aspect and
00:58:30 That's mostly okay
00:58:32 Yeah, there's trade-offs. There's trade-offs that come with it and those trade-offs could be
00:58:38 mitigated with extra effort of making of gififying them for my website
00:58:44 I mean, there's some
00:58:46 audio elements to it that
00:58:49 Are
00:58:51 Going to have to be on the website and will not be able to be heard in pdf form
00:58:56 obviously
00:59:00 So like the jungle beats like the jungle beats. I mean I'm talking about the song of longing you remember the song of longing
00:59:07 I actually haven't reread Biscopades in a while. Well, there's um
00:59:11 There's a song that he attempts to sing and he fails
00:59:16 But that's cute. Yeah
00:59:21 Uh, so that'll that'll come back at some point
00:59:24 Uh, so yeah, that's that's that's that's not gonna be that's not pdf friendly
00:59:30 Um, you know our art
00:59:34 Is so hard and it's impossible actually
00:59:38 I might as well not do any you simply can't you simply you simply can never fully
00:59:44 Actualize any artistic vision you will ever have in your entire life. You'll maybe your entire life will be lead
00:59:53 Giving into a series of trade-offs and compromises
00:59:57 True true
01:00:00 Negotiating
01:00:03 How much of this is is reasonable to actually do and is it still worth doing if that's all I can make happen
01:00:09 And you just gotta and you just gotta make those choices you make those hard choices sometimes
01:00:15 Uh, and that's what I'm freaking doing
01:00:19 Uh
01:00:21 Life's hard
01:00:22 I feel real busy these days. I'm drawing and I'm and I'm streaming and like I'm lifting and like every fucking day
01:00:29 I've got
01:00:30 Shit to do
01:00:32 That's good though
01:00:33 Better than having nothing going on. I mean it's kind. Yeah, it is better than having nothing going on but
01:00:40 I kind of sometimes I wish
01:00:43 I just want to sleep. I just want to stay in bed all day
01:00:47 You're allowed days like that
01:00:49 but it's it is good to be busy with stuff because then
01:00:52 uh
01:00:53 I don't know the mind likes to be occupied. Yeah, it's true
01:01:00 It's true, but then I'm always like
01:01:02 Every day I'm always like I could be doing one thing. Do you have the days off?
01:01:07 I I purposefully do not work on a weekend
01:01:11 I do not allow myself to do work on a weekend and that's very that's allowed me to be like
01:01:16 Pretty fine with with all the amount of stuff I do
01:01:19 I mean, I mean lifting is not like an all-day activity. So I mean
01:01:25 the well
01:01:26 I mean, I don't have really have any days. I don't have designated days off
01:01:31 I have days where I have no
01:01:34 Particular responsibility and those are just the days that I'm supposed to draw on
01:01:39 uh
01:01:42 I I don't have designated
01:01:45 I don't have designated we've talked about this before you give yourself designated days off. I
01:01:50 just
01:01:52 feed
01:01:54 Feel like I should be drawing whenever I have anything else that I shouldn't that I don't have to do
01:01:59 I know but that that's entirely the problem because it's not designated you could feel that stress at all times
01:02:07 You're maximizing stress potential. It's no it's not it's obviously
01:02:12 Bad for for for burnout and stuff
01:02:18 Oh god
01:02:23 Um, yeah, you should have you should have a day and just say that's my self-care day
01:02:28 And I'm just gonna do whatever I want
01:02:33 But no work, I guess because you might want to work
01:02:36 I mean
01:02:38 You should resist the urge
01:02:41 genuinely
01:02:44 Do you find that resisting the urge to work on your day off
01:02:47 Increases your motivation to get your work done on your day's on
01:02:51 well, I think
01:02:54 now that I'm into the in the
01:02:57 I'm used to it. So it's like it's not even a question
01:02:59 It's not like I wanted work, but like early on it was like, but I could get work done
01:03:04 Uh, you know, I feel that stress that anxiety about like I'm supposed to be enjoying myself and relaxing
01:03:10 But like this is a whole day. I could be doing something
01:03:14 And that sort of goes away after a while after a routine is set
01:03:19 Um, I mean and yeah, it does I as to answer your question. It does help
01:03:23 I mean, I definitely I definitely waste days. I'm I don't work every day
01:03:27 There are definitely days that I don't do any work, but they're not days that are designated to not work
01:03:32 They're days when I think I could work today and maybe I will but then I just never do it
01:03:37 Yeah, I think that having a day where you're not allowed to work
01:03:41 goes a long way to making
01:03:43 Waking up on a Monday and being like, all right, let's get some stuff done that that that's so much easier for me now
01:03:49 than it used to be
01:03:51 Even though sometimes I still just have like a I can't fucking think of anything and it's just nothing nothing happens
01:03:56 It's still easier to wake up and be like, all right, let's have some breakfast. Let's get a coffee. Let's go
01:04:03 Let's do something I get a little bit done. Even if it's not a lot
01:04:07 It's it's always like possible to for that to happen. Well, I mean
01:04:11 um
01:04:13 I don't I mean, okay. I guess uh, I guess to be like
01:04:17 I mean, I guess I'm like my Saturdays. I don't really have I mean I I lift on Saturdays, but other than that
01:04:22 I don't like do anything
01:04:25 Uh, there's nothing like I don't know
01:04:29 I I have I have no particular thing that I like want to be doing on my day off
01:04:35 uh
01:04:37 Other than just like fuck around
01:04:39 Just just waste time
01:04:41 Fuck around play a video game play. Yeah, I mean, that's the thing like you can have
01:04:47 If you get like obsessed with a game like noita if you have your designated no work day
01:04:52 It'll be like, well, I know what to do today. I want to play that game. So I'm gonna play the game all day
01:04:58 Hmm. Yeah, so it's like easier to like slot that activity into that time slot
01:05:04 And then the work into the work time slot so that you're not
01:05:07 thinking about doing two things
01:05:09 For the rest of the week. I've been um
01:05:12 I've been playing a rain world if you played rain world
01:05:15 Is that the one where you're like a little liquefied rabbit?
01:05:19 A slug cat. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
01:05:22 I haven't played it, but I seen the clips it looks it's very tough. I think
01:05:27 Yeah, it's pretty tough
01:05:29 And it's very like it doesn't tell you what
01:05:33 You need to do you you have to like figure out stuff through experimentation
01:05:37 And the world is very much like kind of doing its own thing
01:05:40 Regardless of what you do like there's an ecosystem of all these creatures and the creatures just go around hunting on their own
01:05:47 And some of them will hunt you and some of them will ignore you and and just hunt each other and stuff
01:05:53 Uh, I'm about like three or four hours into it now and I feel like that's not long enough to have really like figured it out
01:06:01 um
01:06:02 I'm getting a little bored of it
01:06:05 uh
01:06:06 Everyone tells me it's really good and really deep and stuff
01:06:11 And I feel like maybe I'm just bad, but I'm starting to get bored because
01:06:17 I think every every I'm just like wake up go out
01:06:21 Hunt around
01:06:23 Oh, there are animals avoid them eat food
01:06:27 Maybe I'll maybe I'll get killed and then it's like okay. Well, I didn't make any progress
01:06:32 Maybe I'll find a door that I can get through and then it's like okay. Here's a here's another ruined area
01:06:39 Oh, okay. I'll find a new place to sleep. Oh that now that's my nest now. Okay, cool and then repeat and
01:06:46 I don't know. I have I have yet to feel I've I've found new areas
01:06:50 I have yet to feel like I've made any significant progress
01:06:54 of any kind other than moving to different places
01:06:58 And that's not a good feeling and I don't like it and I get that the game is like not holding my hand
01:07:04 but I
01:07:06 I'm I'm really I'm really hungry. I'm really needing the game to give me some glimmer of like what am I doing here
01:07:13 What's the point? I get that I'm hunting my buddy or my brother or whatever he is
01:07:19 uh
01:07:21 Just feels like
01:07:24 No progress has been made
01:07:26 And I don't like that
01:07:28 Uh, I'm more like lame world. I'm getting a little fed up. I I want I don't want to write it off
01:07:33 I want to keep giving it a chance because I really like a lot of stuff about it
01:07:37 It's just not giving me anything
01:07:39 Uh, but maybe I need to keep at it a little longer
01:07:43 I'm sure I think I feel like
01:07:46 Tio is always in my stream asking me how's you played rain world you're playing rain world. He's gonna be so mad
01:07:51 He's gonna be so mad that I said I said this
01:07:54 Um
01:07:56 I'm not I'm not gonna give up
01:07:58 I'm not gonna give up
01:08:00 You're not gonna give up just like I did with inscription
01:08:04 Ah, it's so good. You were you were getting there. There's there's secrets
01:08:09 The secrets give you don't even know you understand. Are they baleful then?
01:08:14 Um, yeah, some of them are a little bit. Yeah, some are a little bit baleful. Um
01:08:20 Are they bale shape?
01:08:23 They are not
01:08:26 I'm sorry. Oh
01:08:28 Uh, yeah, they should have been. Um
01:08:32 I try I tried to play noida the other day and then I realized I have a save file going where I have like an all-powerful god build
01:08:40 Made I have a wand
01:08:42 That simultaneously teleports me and for one frame creates a giant black hole
01:08:48 Where I teleport to and then deletes the black hole before I can do anything
01:08:53 So the wand like rapid fire machine gun shoots out teleport spells that travel instantaneously
01:09:01 Create a black and so they it deletes any matter that's in front of me
01:09:05 So I can just travel in a straight line through anything through like a mountain
01:09:09 Just dig right through it and like it like it's not even there
01:09:12 Uh, it's pretty funny
01:09:15 It's it's pretty cool. But uh, you know, I'm at that point and I'm like, well, I pretty much built the ultimate wand
01:09:22 Uh, I could just go win the game. I guess but
01:09:26 But it'd be such a shame to end the save file when I'm so powerful
01:09:30 So I like booted the game up and then I remembered. Oh wait, I have like a god mode run going
01:09:33 Ah, never mind games boring games sucks. Don't want to play it
01:09:38 Played rain world instead was like, ah cool game. But what am I doing here exactly gave up on it? Stop playing it
01:09:45 Uh
01:09:47 You know, there's just nothing good in the world on on earth. Yeah
01:09:51 Video games are the worst thing
01:09:53 That anyone ever thought of what if you went outside?
01:09:56 That don't even get me started on going outside. You think video games are bad
01:10:01 Don't even freaking talk about that. Uh, Jesus
01:10:06 There's so much to be found in nature. There are birds and rocks
01:10:11 Who cares who cares genuine genuinely who cares? Um, who gives a fuck me?
01:10:17 Stupid annoying. I like I like the nature. I like seeing
01:10:21 The sunshine dance upon the leaves
01:10:25 I'm shaking my head in shame in shame and bemusement and confusion. I
01:10:34 We're just not gonna we're just not gonna agree on this one. We're not gonna make it
01:10:39 We're not we're in gmi
01:10:44 No, I hate outside
01:10:47 There's COVID out there
01:10:49 There is COVID out there
01:10:51 I'm surprised I haven't gotten COVID again. Well, actually, I'm not that surprised. The only place I would get it would be on the bus
01:10:57 Uh, but I haven't gotten it. So that's pretty good. I thought I was getting sick the other day
01:11:03 But I it was fine. Didn't didn't come down with anything
01:11:07 I um, I'm expecting a sickness
01:11:10 People were coughing my dad was coughing and he's like, oh, yeah, there's this thing going around and I hadn't gotten anything yet
01:11:15 So I'm like, fuck. I'm the last one who's gonna get it
01:11:18 Oh, well, it's not COVID. I probably not nobody's having a problem
01:11:23 Yeah
01:11:25 Cases are really cases are quite low in my area right now. So I seem like like I'm pretty unlikely to get it
01:11:33 soon
01:11:35 Even in the worst case scenario
01:11:37 So that's nice, I guess
01:11:39 Um, well then if you don't like video games if you don't like the outside, what about anime?
01:11:45 Uh
01:11:47 What about it, uh
01:11:51 Uh, what do you want to watch some?
01:11:56 No
01:11:59 Why do you is there one in particular your no, well, I um
01:12:04 Somebody asked me
01:12:06 I think it was prince isolation and on my stream
01:12:09 Asked me what my favorite anime was and it seemed like just a genuine question
01:12:13 Uh, yeah, and I'm like I I couldn't answer immediately. So I went today
01:12:18 I tried to figure out all the animes that I've seen
01:12:21 Uh, all of or most of which is not that many
01:12:25 And I put them in a tournament bracket and I tried to figure out who is the best of my favorites is animes
01:12:30 Which is my favorite anime here's an image of the tournament. Yeah, I was gonna say show me
01:12:35 I mean
01:12:37 Monster, okay
01:12:40 So what's your thoughts on these these choices?
01:12:44 Uh, there's a there's a bunch here. I haven't seen
01:12:49 I have not seen monster. I have seen a little bit of inferno cop
01:12:53 I've never seen onigai teacher never seen revolutionary girl utina never seen bleach
01:12:58 Never never even heard of wait kenpu denki berserk. What is that? Is that like berserk?
01:13:03 That's the berserk from the 90s. It means like the
01:13:06 The the you know the golden age arc or whatever
01:13:09 Because the the the the more recent one is just called berserk and it's the one that sucks
01:13:15 I have not seen oh the 3d one. Yeah, 3d one. I guess there's another one as well. I don't I don't know what that's called
01:13:22 Never seen hands off isa can never seen sungatsu no lion
01:13:26 Sungatsu no lion is so good. You would like it because the guy is uh, uh, he's got glasses and he's sad
01:13:33 That's all I need. That's all I need
01:13:35 Uh, never seen I've seen some of the melakara of hara hara isusami
01:13:40 I've never seen gun demore in the pocket pocket. I've seen all of
01:13:45 I've seen all of uh
01:13:47 The rest I think you've seen space runaway idiom
01:13:52 There's a few in the second round that weren't in the first round. Oh
01:13:56 Death note space
01:13:58 runaway idiom
01:14:00 Gorin lagann and lucky star
01:14:03 No, I've never seen space runaway idiom
01:14:07 I think I've seen all the all the rest um
01:14:11 so
01:14:14 Did you so
01:14:16 Am I reading this right? Did you say that sungatsu no lion is your favorite anime?
01:14:20 Uh, no berserk is my favorite sungatsu is very good and it's second place
01:14:26 And then in the bronze the third third the best is kari kano the the romance one
01:14:33 Kari kano is really good and it's so
01:14:36 Doesn't it just end like it doesn't have an ending right? Yeah, it just sort of ends. I think the manga
01:14:42 Goes on a bit longer, but it's sort of also it just ends
01:14:45 Can't remember if I read all of it
01:14:47 Have you you have not seen um
01:14:50 Samurai shampoo. No, that's one of those ones I kept hearing about and I just never go around
01:14:55 I think it's better than cowboy bebop if I'm if I'm well honest if I'm honest with myself
01:15:02 I like it more
01:15:04 um
01:15:06 I mean, yeah, these are
01:15:08 pretty good
01:15:10 pics I guess
01:15:14 I
01:15:16 I don't know
01:15:18 I don't really have uh
01:15:21 Don't really have okay. You thought you thought cowboy bebop was better than kill a kill
01:15:25 No, I guess I'd agree with that. It's it's close. You know cowboy bebop. I love it. He thought cowboy bebop was better than
01:15:30 diebuster
01:15:32 I
01:15:33 I know I you know, you know, I'm a little I'm a
01:15:36 I love diebuster
01:15:37 I'm a little bit of a cowboy bebop hater
01:15:39 Like I don't like it as much as everyone else does like I just think it's kind of good. Uh, you know
01:15:45 It's hard on reflection. There's so much about cowboy cowboy bebop that I like that is
01:15:50 mostly vibes
01:15:51 Rather than like oh this episode. So there are a few episodes. They're just sort of like I don't I don't really
01:15:57 I don't really vibe with it. I don't really love the vibe cowboy bebop. I know I I
01:16:03 I feel like it's heresy, but
01:16:05 I don't know. It's it's cowboys in space. It's it's exactly those vibes combined in a very brown
01:16:12 great
01:16:13 the the kind of like
01:16:15 Jazzy noir vibe is just not my
01:16:19 It's not super my cup of tea. I think the I like I like shampoos viable a lot better. Mm-hmm
01:16:26 Where is um
01:16:28 Where's gun buster on here? Oh gun buster
01:16:31 Gun buster lost to one piece which is you fucking idiot you fucking moron. Fuck you
01:16:38 I was waiting for you to find that one
01:16:40 One piece beat death note. What's wrong with you because I just I like on reflection all of it like one piece is
01:16:46 Got a good anime actually. It's actually very good. Nothing doesn't it's it's good in places. It's good in parts
01:16:53 Yes, I think that's not really falls off after L's death and it's just sort of like yeah, it does
01:16:59 Okay, but the first half of death note is like
01:17:02 I don't know. I mean it's a good anime. It's it's
01:17:06 Obviously the manga is better as it almost always is yes if this was a manga thing
01:17:10 It'll be different. It would be different very different. Although. I don't know one piece might
01:17:15 Soundcaster no line also has a manga and it's also very good
01:17:19 Die buster and gun buster for me would make it like all the way at least to the semifinals
01:17:25 For these wait a fucking second. Do you think try gun is better than fully cooly? Oh, no
01:17:31 You're fucking cracked. You're fucking cracked in the coconut. All right. I I had I thought about it and I'm like
01:17:38 Fully cooly is pretty cool. It's not like I didn't like anything. I think I like basically everything except like
01:17:46 pokemon
01:17:48 and a lot of bleach and Naruto are lame
01:17:51 um, yeah
01:17:52 But like fully cooly is great. Try gun is it edged it out?
01:17:57 I don't know what to say. I couldn't think of like a smart reason
01:18:00 You
01:18:03 You just don't know I don't know just like oh my god. Is it just because there's more of it? No, no, no
01:18:09 That's not I haven't even finished try gun
01:18:13 I just really like the the aesthetic
01:18:16 I I I get that I do like the aesthetic of try gun
01:18:19 I'm with you on that try gun's a fucking mess like the original try gun show like it's a total
01:18:25 It's a total mess. Maybe maybe
01:18:27 I it's it's it's all aesthetic
01:18:31 And I I don't know honestly try gun try gun does have a good aesthetic. I I I strongly agree
01:18:38 But so does fully cooly. It's so does fully cooly. It's hard. I think I think the thing about fully cooly
01:18:43 Was just I was completely confused and I need to rewatch it
01:18:46 I need to rewatch it and then I'll I'll I'll put a higher up
01:18:51 Yeah, I mean sure true true. I watched it and I was like, huh?
01:18:56 Oh, it's over. Wait a minute. You think neon genesis even galleon is better than bleach?
01:19:02 What the fuck?
01:19:06 They don't they don't even have a single giant sword in neon genesis eva and galleon
01:19:11 They do they have like a like a they just have a big lance. Yeah, it's uh, it's basically a sword
01:19:17 It's basically a bank. Hey, you know, it's in that's incorrect. It's not it's not accurate. What if shinji was a shinjigami?
01:19:27 Oh my god, what do you what would I don't know what I would do in that scenario?
01:19:32 I just I just I've been I've been like getting further and further for my microphone
01:19:36 I'm sorry if my voice has been getting quieter and quieter. Well, you're screaming you're screaming about anime and it's it's
01:19:41 I've just been leaning. Yeah, I
01:19:44 I gotta say I do now that you say I do strongly disagree with a few of a few of these match-ups
01:19:50 I really don't know
01:19:52 What is going on with you dog?
01:19:57 Well, that's the reason I brought it into the show
01:19:59 Viewers at home, please seize and cope
01:20:03 and rage against me
01:20:06 Also, um, I
01:20:07 I like I do like I like the karekano beats melancholy of haruhi susumi agree agree with that. Yes agree with that one
01:20:14 Where's utena? I was I was annoyed that utena went up against gurren lagann immediately because I really like utena
01:20:21 And it's stopped to the first round
01:20:23 You you think you think eva you eva beats gurren lagann for me gurren lagann beats eva no question
01:20:29 But I mean it's a little hard. I understand I understand why someone would like eva better. It's a it's a different sort of feeling
01:20:36 Um, obviously eva is very dark
01:20:39 Shinji's a little fucker little fuck boy
01:20:41 and he's
01:20:43 life sucks
01:20:46 And I think oh, you know what I was going through my head as I was doing this
01:20:50 I was like I clearly have a preference
01:20:54 um for four by three like
01:20:57 drawn on cell animated shows
01:21:00 Things that are like hd digitized stuff
01:21:03 I tend to not like the look of them so much
01:21:06 Which is why san katsu no line getting all the way to the finals is quite good
01:21:11 I really like that. I I I I understand that aesthetic preference. I I really do
01:21:17 um
01:21:21 I mean, okay
01:21:23 I try to rewatch gurren lagann not too long ago. It's not like I it's not like I don't understand
01:21:29 What there is to like about
01:21:31 These shows even the ones that I don't think should have made it so far
01:21:36 Uh, I mean, you know pretty good. You know what I like you know what I like about this list is that there's not too many
01:21:42 Items on it. It's comprehensible if you'd seen like 40 anime this list would be a nightmare. Oh, yeah
01:21:47 I would have multiple different images. I suppose there'll be like brackets
01:21:52 It'll just be like, you know, what's funny. I realize I had not seen a single dragon ball, you know anime
01:21:58 I've only read the manga
01:22:00 Maybe I should make a uh
01:22:02 A tier a thing like this because I haven't seen that many anime. Yeah, I would love
01:22:07 I would love to see probably seen more than you but not by like that much
01:22:10 I would love to see you do a tournament bracket anime thing. How did you?
01:22:14 How did you make a list of of anime you see?
01:22:17 I google's tournament bracket generator and this website came up
01:22:21 But it was really annoying because it asked me to sign up so that I can start the tournament
01:22:25 Um, I've you I've used this website before this this tournament
01:22:29 Yeah, I remember it not being quite as annoying the last time I used it
01:22:33 But yeah, you have to sign up now. Um, I can't remember what website it was on and I closed the tab
01:22:37 But how did you come up with your anime list? Did you just think of them off the top of your head?
01:22:41 I thought of the ones I could think of and then I went to my anime list and I scrolled down
01:22:46 Did the top most popular animes and I was like every so often I'd be like, oh, how did I forget space dandy got to put that on there
01:22:53 Things like that. Yeah
01:22:54 I haven't really seen any like super obscure stuff other than like garzi's wing. You didn't put garzi's wing on here
01:23:01 I don't think I actually watched the whole thing or like a lot of it. You didn't put mad you didn't put mad bull on here
01:23:05 Oh mad bull. Yeah, we watched that how much did we watch all of it? We I
01:23:11 We watched a couple episodes. I don't know how much of it there actually is
01:23:15 Mad bull mad bull should be on this if it's like an ova
01:23:19 Which plebeian weave episode what what what plebeian weave show did you watch?
01:23:24 I watched the k-lon movie and this this doesn't include animated
01:23:29 Anime movies just ova's and yeah serialized tv
01:23:34 Yeah, one of the ones that I would have to put on my list would be I think it was called planetarian
01:23:39 The show that I watched for that. Oh, I guess that I guess that's a good time to mention that
01:23:44 I have I have made the plebeian weave blu rays. I'm no longer selling them. They're free now
01:23:49 They're on my website. The files are downloadable
01:23:52 stcomics.com
01:23:54 Slash store.html the iso file is just up for download and if you have a burner you can download it and you can
01:24:01 Burn your own plebeian weave blu rays
01:24:03 If you I've the power to the people
01:24:06 Uh, they're democratized now lol
01:24:10 Uh, okay. Yes, uh, there are four episodes of mad bull
01:24:16 And I think we would have watched the whole thing. So I should have put mad bull. I forgot mad bull that mad bull was great
01:24:23 Mad bull was pretty good. It was pretty
01:24:25 I don't know if I would I don't know if I would have liked it as much if we didn't watch it in a big room with people yelling
01:24:33 And getting drunk and getting drunk
01:24:37 Yes, um, it definitely benefited from that
01:24:41 But I think it's I mean we were all like cynical at the beginning like uh, this is
01:24:45 Is this like a really cheap shit thing?
01:24:48 And then and it kind of was it kind of it was it's pulpy. It's like really like pulpy
01:24:54 I would maybe maybe say exploitative exploitative and like, um
01:24:59 Um
01:25:00 We we really came to like it because it was insane
01:25:04 But then it became self aware about how insane it was and it just kept going and it was like, oh now it's now it's now
01:25:10 We can like it normally
01:25:12 And we're not laughing at it. We're laughing with it now that that now that they have shown
01:25:17 That they understand that this is like
01:25:20 You know
01:25:21 It it is silly, but like it insane and cool and mad bull himself
01:25:26 It's like the coolest guy
01:25:28 He's so cool
01:25:30 He loves the ladies
01:25:33 Just like me
01:25:36 It's like he's an american
01:25:38 And then the the little guys like a japanese transfer or something
01:25:42 Wait, does the show take place in like new york?
01:25:46 Yeah, yeah, he's I think it's in new york and his the main character is like a japanese
01:25:51 Officer that's on like fucking exchange program or something
01:25:55 Yeah
01:25:56 See to see how the real cops do it in nypd
01:26:01 A cab includes mad bull, but you know what I still support him
01:26:07 He's he is a bastard, but he's a he's a lovable bastard, you know, he's just you love to hate him
01:26:13 Uh, what was what was this website used to make this tournament? Um
01:26:18 Mad bull monument
01:26:21 He could vor the little guy so big
01:26:23 Jesus
01:26:25 tournament
01:26:26 Bracket generator. Yeah
01:26:29 Challenge is it challenge? Yes. That was the website. All right, cool
01:26:35 Well, I won't I won't make it now. Um, but that will be fun. I will try and make one of those for the next episode
01:26:42 Yeah, once I finished utena, I will be looking for a new
01:26:46 Like cool anime to watch that's
01:26:50 Uh, give her watch, uh, give her watch. Okay, should I include anime that I've seen like two episodes of?
01:26:55 I could have added so many to this if I included like one or two or three episodes
01:27:01 I've seen like two episodes of i've seen like two episodes of musishi
01:27:05 I don't know if I should include that one
01:27:07 Oh
01:27:08 Fuck what was the what's the what's it called?
01:27:13 Um, oh
01:27:16 No, I can't remember it. Um, munchie loves this. It's a cg anime
01:27:22 With a guy with wearing a red and white stripes like full body something or other
01:27:28 And there's a little dog demon guy with a mask on her face
01:27:33 Chainsaw man
01:27:35 No, not chainsaw man. It's it's like a kids show like 3d animated
01:27:41 But like creepy looking
01:27:43 And it's kind of insane like are you talking about like poppy the entertainer poppy? Yes
01:27:49 That's not an anime
01:27:52 That's an anime. That's not japanese
01:27:55 Isn't it?
01:27:56 No, that's like an adult swim original poppy the performer
01:28:01 Is a series of 3d cg shorts produced for kids nation one of the old time
01:28:07 Well, the all anime satellite stations in japan. Yeah, no, there's japanese
01:28:11 Oh, what the fuck poppy the performer the show is produced by husband and wife team ryuji misuda and waka
01:28:18 Wakako misuda
01:28:21 Okay, well shit
01:28:23 Maybe it counts as an anime. I would say it counts because it's like it's I mean, it's an odd sort of thing
01:28:29 But like it doesn't it doesn't feel like an anime. It doesn't
01:28:33 Feel like it should count. Uh, well, I I feel I feel like it should count
01:28:39 Yeah, I mean, yeah, yeah, okay. I I get it
01:28:43 Okay, so poppy the performer mad bowl. I'm gonna do like right now who wins. Oh, no, that's too difficult. Ooh
01:28:50 poppy versus mad bowl
01:28:53 Who could who will survive
01:28:55 the battle
01:28:57 I've actually seen a lot of
01:28:59 I've probably seen a lot of like crappy anime like if I if I combed through mal
01:29:02 I could probably remember a bunch of stuff that I like completely forgot that I
01:29:07 Watched once upon a time like show bits. I've seen show bits for some reason
01:29:12 Yeah, on a guy teacher was one of those like steel angel karumi
01:29:16 I I I learned about anime and I watched like Naruto on some site and then I was like, oh
01:29:22 What's these other things and I think on a guy teacher was one of them
01:29:27 And I was wait, have you know?
01:29:28 Oh, sorry
01:29:30 Yeah, I've never seen on again. I don't I think it's just sort of like
01:29:34 Oh wait, no, I remember the guy there's a man boy teen boy
01:29:39 Um, he wakes up man boy teen boy. Gotcha. He wakes up from a coma and he is
01:29:46 A teenager on the inside
01:29:50 Or something. No, I can't remember Conan detective Conan
01:29:55 No, no, I read detective Conan for a bit
01:30:01 There's something something
01:30:04 like
01:30:05 Waking up out of a coma and being like too old for all the people around you or something
01:30:11 I don't remember I hate that's how I feel every day when I wake up one day K Kusanagi notices a strange glowing woman by the lake
01:30:18 What he discovers that the woman is actually an alien officer from the galaxy federation. Hang on. This isn't the right thing
01:30:25 She's also his teacher and in spite of the setback he and his teacher gradually get to know each other romance blossoms
01:30:30 What
01:30:34 They get married
01:30:36 There's no way I watched this doesn't seem right
01:30:39 Have you have you not seen full metal alchemist?
01:30:42 No, I did
01:30:44 There's two shows and I didn't know which one to pick because they people say oh, they're both good in their different ways
01:30:49 And I'm like, okay. Yeah, I've I've only seen the old one
01:30:55 Okay, there's lots of like things I've heard about and I'm like, oh cool
01:31:00 Never did you did you never watch Yu-Gi-Oh?
01:31:03 I I caught like an episode a hero there
01:31:07 I actually caught an episode of like Yu-Gi-Oh gx or like some Yu-Gi-Oh movie
01:31:11 I actually watched a somewhat can I would probably have to include Yu-Gi-Oh not like gx or any of the sequel series
01:31:17 But the original series I watched a bunch of it just because it was on
01:31:25 I'm getting distracted if I if I let myself all oh just make my list right now
01:31:30 Oh ichigo marino. She is uh, yeah, I remember now. It's the loli character, but with the she's aged up
01:31:39 mentally
01:31:40 She's young. She's not a kid, but she's 15 outside and she's been in a coma
01:31:47 For a long time and her real age is 21 wait, huh?
01:31:51 Wait, how does this make sense?
01:31:54 She resembles a 15 year old
01:31:56 But her real age is 21
01:31:58 Her physical development was stunted due to stand stills
01:32:02 To the same way they affected k
01:32:05 stand still
01:32:06 What the fuck is that?
01:32:08 You know
01:32:09 I guess I remember it making sense while I was watching
01:32:13 Is that like a magic thing?
01:32:14 No, no, I think it was I think it was
01:32:17 It was all well the teacher's an alien. I don't remember that part. I guess it is my teacher is an alien
01:32:24 Oh, do you mean the series of children's novels by bruce coville?
01:32:27 That I read when I was a little kid and that taught me to be a communist before I even realized it
01:32:32 Yes
01:32:35 That's what you're talking about, right? Yes. Yes
01:32:39 um everyone everyone everyone should go read we should we should have a
01:32:43 We should do a podcast. We should make a new podcast
01:32:46 We should make a new podcast where we just read my teacher is an alien
01:32:49 You know, you know the animorphine time guys. It was tyler who was a big animorphs fan making nate
01:32:55 Read animorphs for the first time. I should do that to you. I should make you read my teacher's an alien for the first time
01:33:01 He's like third grade reading level children's novels and be like, yeah, yeah
01:33:08 Isn't brach's home based and you'll be like yes, and I'll say thanks
01:33:13 Yes, it's brach's home kreblem
01:33:17 There was the blue one
01:33:20 And I think that's it I think there were just three aliens
01:33:23 I may have also watched
01:33:25 Onigai twins. I thought it was maybe part of the same series
01:33:30 Might be but it's like a different guy
01:33:33 So so anime movies don't count like paprika doesn't count a millennium actress is not no
01:33:38 I mean, I think they count in like my anime list people would say. Oh, what's your favorite anime?
01:33:43 And they say spirited away and like it's something about it feels wrong just because like I associated with like a serialized long running
01:33:49 Or other ways multi-episode little thing
01:33:53 Okay, I won't I won't yeah, no no if I included movies there would be like a lot more
01:33:58 Yeah, and how do you how do you compare spirited away to like uh inferno cop
01:34:04 To inferno cop. Oh, you know what I watched uh like this past week in a call in the in rfck
01:34:11 Uh, I watched porco roso for the first time
01:34:14 Yo, that's a great one that one. It was great. It was awesome. It might be my new favorite ghibli
01:34:19 My old one was kiki's delivery service, but the porco roso might be better
01:34:23 It's it was so good. It was awesome. It ruled. I love how he's he's not recommended enough
01:34:29 He's a piggy
01:34:32 Okay
01:34:33 So I'm not supposed to understand why he's a pig, right?
01:34:37 I think it is theme. Well
01:34:40 That it's not like it's
01:34:43 Only we can see it people do refer to him as a pig. I think the girl the girl asks him. Why are you a pig? Yeah?
01:34:49 I think um, it's a thematic reason
01:34:53 Like he like yeah
01:34:54 Something something pig. I I don't actually know why something something pig. Yeah
01:34:59 But I think if you analyze that you could come up with a good, you know theory as to why
01:35:04 Well, well when she asks him why he's a pig
01:35:08 He says
01:35:09 Basically, he tells that story about how his whole squadron was shot down and he basically he told he should have died
01:35:16 He had a near-death experience where he saw his whole squadron
01:35:20 Go to heaven basically and he was like on his way to heaven
01:35:24 or maybe hell
01:35:25 But then like god sent him back and I guess
01:35:30 He was a pig after that
01:35:32 I guess is is what i'm supposed to take away from that
01:35:34 I love that scene by the way of them rising up through the clouds
01:35:38 Yeah, I just kept
01:35:40 I just kept wanting him to reach down
01:35:42 And scoop up some of the cloud
01:35:44 Like liquid that he's like floating on in his plane. He was it was like right there. It's just just scoop up some in your hand
01:35:52 um
01:35:53 Yeah, it was a good scene, but
01:35:55 Is it is it like a is it like a joke about pigs fly is is that it?
01:36:01 I mean if it is a joke it would be a japanese joke
01:36:04 So it might be something that doesn't make sense in English. I wonder if I wonder if they have that expression in japanese
01:36:13 It's something about like almost going to heaven but being turned away turned him into a pig
01:36:20 Maybe like and then okay, but then it feels like he's not good enough to be alive
01:36:25 And like god has rejected him like he should have died with his people
01:36:30 Yes, he said he said loathing. I'm a pig like it's sort of something he said all the good. He said all the good ones died
01:36:38 Yeah, and like maybe god would reject you if you're like a little beastling a little pig guy
01:36:44 And so he sees himself like that and it's manifested physically literally just the plot of that of that bones in the ocean song
01:36:54 same
01:36:56 Same story. I was like as a shanty. It's not a real shanty. It's a it's a it's a modern
01:37:05 It's a modern band made it in the style of an old shanty. So it's not like a genuine worker's song
01:37:11 Uh, but it's the same the plot is a guy like has like survivor's guilt basically over the fact that his whole crew drowned
01:37:19 And he was the only survivor
01:37:21 Uh
01:37:22 There's this scene. Okay at the end the end credits though. They show all those like
01:37:28 drawings of a whole squad
01:37:31 of pigs
01:37:32 and I I think
01:37:34 I I wonder
01:37:36 If that's his his crew in heaven
01:37:42 That's the only thing I can think of is that when you go to heaven you become a pig and he
01:37:46 Went but was turned away and he became a pig
01:37:50 But he didn't go to heaven and now he's just he's a he's a heaven pig on earth
01:37:56 Hmm
01:37:57 Like like the idea that he sees himself as like a worthless guy who you know, he's not one of the good ones
01:38:04 He should have died then
01:38:05 Um, he sees himself as a pig. It's like like on the face of a derogatory
01:38:10 But then it turns out
01:38:12 God loves pigs more than anyone else. I kind of feel yes
01:38:16 That's kind of what I came is that it's some sort of like weird like heaven blessing
01:38:21 Yeah, is that his like his brush with heaven turned him
01:38:23 Maybe he comes back. This is what an angel looks like. He came back with an angelic glow and he doesn't realize it
01:38:29 That's what I think and I might be reading too much into the like
01:38:32 I feel like the drawings at the end of like the whole like everyone's a pig
01:38:36 That might just be like concept art that they use and they didn't mean for you to like
01:38:40 Read into it that much but like reading into it is like who are these people
01:38:44 And the only thing it's they show a whole squad of pilots and they're all pigs like is this his
01:38:49 Or is this his squadron? And that's the only that's the only thing I can think of unless it's like
01:38:55 No, that's the that's the only thing that makes sense
01:38:57 I I if I either I discount that as like not canon or
01:39:02 What what else could be that's my interpretation
01:39:05 And it's very it's very smart. Thank you
01:39:09 Uh, good good good movie though and now I understand
01:39:13 You remember mr. Boop
01:39:17 Yes, did he do a porco rosso thing?
01:39:21 Yeah, the gina gina from porco rosso is like his ex-girlfriend
01:39:25 And when he's like and when yeah when he's um
01:39:29 I think it's when mr. Boop or it's when betty gets kidnapped by her dad mr. Boop
01:39:35 Uh, he like goes to see his ex-girlfriend gina from porco rosso and it's like I don't know what to do about my marriage
01:39:42 And she's like if you love her you got to go after her
01:39:45 Uh alec and he's like, yeah, thanks gino from porco rosso
01:39:50 It's too bad our relationship didn't work out because you don't like having orgies and I love having orgies and she's like, yeah
01:39:56 Okay
01:40:02 Good old mr. Boop
01:40:05 And I was like now I get it now I get who gino from porco rosso is she's a nice lady. She's a nice lady
01:40:11 Yeah, like a little
01:40:13 Weird world war two speakeasy sort of place
01:40:17 She like a server or like a singer or something. I don't remember. I think she was a singer
01:40:24 I I wasn't sure if porco is supposed to be like an old guy, but I don't think he's not like that old
01:40:28 And he's like 30 or something because like he's a world war one pilot and this is like
01:40:34 The interim in between world war one and world war two. So like it hasn't actually been that long
01:40:39 Since world war one at first of the movie began. I thought he was supposed to be like an old old guy
01:40:44 But no, he's just a somewhat his his little
01:40:49 He looks old being a pig being a pig really really puts years on
01:40:53 in photographs
01:40:55 on film
01:40:57 It has that effect. Yes
01:40:59 Yeah, okay. Well, I'm glad we anyway. I just wanted to talk about how good porco rosso is. Um
01:41:05 Just the the the the exuberant joy of flying really comes through and
01:41:11 porco is just a very
01:41:14 Fun and funny and likable
01:41:16 Dude and just the vibe of the film is immaculate
01:41:20 Yes, I always loved the uh
01:41:23 the way it's I mean the
01:41:25 The vistas and the
01:41:27 The the shots of like of like the clouds
01:41:31 Um casting shadows on the ocean flying through that like that's
01:41:35 That's real shit. That's what I like to see in real life
01:41:39 Yeah, the the vistas and just how like you you're always seeing you're always seeing just like people in town
01:41:45 Just like going about their lives and doing stuff and like the whole team working on the plane. It's just like
01:41:51 What a nice time everybody's having
01:41:54 Yes, just great
01:41:57 um
01:41:58 Yeah, well, I won't put that on my tournament list because it is a film
01:42:05 But it was good, uh, okay
01:42:08 I have another thing to say about this week and it's uh another horrifying
01:42:15 terrible nightmare
01:42:17 Uh, so there was like a an april fools video from gino samuel
01:42:22 You know
01:42:23 Do you know about this? Do you see this? No, I didn't see anything about that
01:42:27 Yeah, well, they they recently uh got to the part where I have the conversation with chris on twitch about
01:42:33 the merge and stuff
01:42:35 and uh
01:42:37 I guess the april fools video includes like an ai generated conversation between me and chris
01:42:43 And I guess it ends with like chris
01:42:45 gets the good good it's like good ending
01:42:48 And I I I didn't watch that. I just heard second hand, but uh apparently good ending is like
01:42:54 Fully transitions gets bottom surgery goes on to become a you know a fully realized
01:43:02 woman leading a in the big city leading a
01:43:06 Prosperous life or whatever, uh, and it's a you know
01:43:10 Whatever they they aide me is the is the point the ai convote me over on gino
01:43:16 And that's fine
01:43:18 And that's fine
01:43:21 I I guess it's fine
01:43:24 It's fine. It's fine
01:43:27 That's the worst part
01:43:29 No, it's okay. Everyone told me like it's someone told me that like it's it's obviously a joke like nobody's gonna watch this
01:43:35 Yeah, I mean, I I think it just sucks that like
01:43:38 people who have interacted with chris chan are gonna be part of those
01:43:43 3000 hour documentaries on youtube
01:43:46 it it it does
01:43:49 Make me look a little escance that like
01:43:53 Yeah, gino
01:43:55 It seems like he'll just read any series of tweets that like anyone had at any point with chris
01:44:01 And like that's a video like that's a dot in goes into in the documentary
01:44:06 uh
01:44:07 How on earth could really really feels like scraping the bottom of the barrel for like relevant content
01:44:12 How is that the the big playlists that gino samuel?
01:44:16 I guess
01:44:18 It's like 70 episodes now 78
01:44:21 How is there like a like a thing you can do to see how long a playlist is?
01:44:28 Uh, I think it says if you click on the playlist and it and it opens it up in its own window
01:44:33 Like the playlist list on the right side should have the number of videos in it
01:44:37 But I mean like the the watch time like how long have people I've been watching this for
01:44:44 How many hours of their own lives have they wasted?
01:44:47 I mean
01:44:49 I mean by that metric lots of things have wasted huge amounts of
01:44:53 Yeah, but like the chris chan documentary does not like you could tell that story so much more succinctly
01:44:59 Like it's so bloated whatever it's going. Yeah
01:45:03 It's it's bloated
01:45:05 I I get it. I I get
01:45:08 I get that like you can continue to make content
01:45:11 So why not just continue to make content and I get that like people just want stuff to listen to
01:45:17 I get it
01:45:19 But it it it really does feel like scraping the bottom of the barrel
01:45:23 like it's it there there's not actually 70 episodes worth of like
01:45:29 Explanation required to understand this we're just kind of we're just kind of rolling in the slop now
01:45:35 We're just kind of reveling in in the same old shit, which is okay. I'm not judging anyone
01:45:40 I don't I don't even I don't even begrudge it. I mean I I get it
01:45:44 I get I get the appeal from both the creator's perspective and the audience perspective of you know, pretty repetitive
01:45:50 Not particularly edifying. We're not actually gonna learn anything from this. Whatever. We're just here to waste time. That's fine
01:45:56 Well, yeah, um, yeah
01:45:58 That style of content. I guess it's just the fact that it's like it sort of betrays the real reason
01:46:05 people
01:46:06 like
01:46:08 Think about chris channel all the time is not to
01:46:11 Answer questions like wow wonder what's going on there and then they need a like a explained video
01:46:16 It's just to like revel in the slop
01:46:19 forever
01:46:20 That playlist will never end. I don't think
01:46:23 People will will want to just think about how much chris is cringe
01:46:28 Over and over again for the rest of their lives and it's the fact that it's the fact that it's made it to 70 episodes
01:46:34 Yeah, tells me that there's pretty much no bottom to like how irrelevant something has to be in order to like be included
01:46:42 I guess he's going in like roughly chronological order. So I feel like it's
01:46:47 It has to run out at some point
01:46:49 I mean when they get to the the trial
01:46:53 Or the you know the incarceration. Oh, she's out. She's she's free. Did you know that?
01:46:59 And I think that was mentioned last episode. Oh, sorry. I think so. I can't remember
01:47:04 It all runs together. Yeah, okay
01:47:07 I I got a little boost to my chris chan videos because she was in the news
01:47:10 Well, you know on twitter a bit
01:47:12 Uh, because she's fucking been bailed out
01:47:15 No word on like what she's doing or I don't think there's been any further details about it
01:47:22 I mean, I I'm kind of curious like who bailed her out. Where is she?
01:47:26 Uh, I'd like to know
01:47:29 but
01:47:30 But uh, you know, we'll probably won't know until she gets back on twitter or something if if that even happens
01:47:38 I've soured on it
01:47:40 I was curious when I heard about sonichu for the first time. It's like wow, this comic sucks. What the fuck?
01:47:46 But I always felt like it really does. I always felt like it was kind of like
01:47:51 You know
01:47:52 um endearing in a way that somebody has this little idea and they just keep drawing a comic and I'm like
01:47:57 That reminds me of when I was like five. Yeah, I like that
01:48:01 But then it became so much more horrible
01:48:05 Over time, you know, I like the outsider art aspect of it. I like to think about like, you know
01:48:13 It's it's interesting to read this comic and be like this this comic is so weird and then to understand like
01:48:20 You know what the thought process was behind why the comic is this way. It's like, well, that's interesting
01:48:26 Uh, yeah, and that's why, you know, my videos about it are about the comic and like they reference the author and they talk about
01:48:33 What was going on with her at the time? But that's not
01:48:37 You know, you can't avoid talking about that, but that's not like the focus
01:48:40 Now the focus is clearly
01:48:43 Oh, yeah. Yeah, you're talking about your thing. Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, but you're saying yeah the focus of like on
01:48:49 on her personally, I mean, I'm just curious because
01:48:53 Like where she is now because like, you know, the the bad
01:48:57 thing is that like did a troll bail her out is some troll like
01:49:01 Holding her hostage or something. Uh, it's possible
01:49:05 I think it might be more likely that some relative might have might have bailed her out
01:49:10 I don't know. I I'm genuinely just I'm shocked that she was bailed out on on the charges
01:49:16 I'm shocked that like that that was apparently not supposed to be an option
01:49:19 But somehow it became one and it's very strange and uh, you know, it doesn't seem
01:49:26 Like that should be
01:49:28 the case
01:49:29 Seems dangerous. It seems like a dangerous situation
01:49:32 I don't know. I feel like I don't care
01:49:36 All right. All right. I get you. It's it's just like the only reason we're hearing about any of this
01:49:41 is because of the
01:49:44 status of chris chen as a
01:49:46 Public figure that everyone's paying attention to
01:49:50 Yeah
01:49:51 Otherwise it would have been it would have been this, you know, we like the comic and if if chris chen wasn't well known
01:49:57 This may have happened anyway, and it would have been like a small article
01:50:00 and we've never heard about anything and
01:50:03 This all could have happened the exact same way
01:50:05 And we just would not be none the wiser
01:50:08 And I think that's that's just, you know
01:50:12 Doesn't need to be looked at honestly
01:50:16 Uh, I guess I guess you got a point
01:50:19 um
01:50:22 Well, I mean, I'm not like
01:50:25 I'm not like looking into it, but I assume that someone will tell me
01:50:29 Like people just messaged me to be like did you hear did you hear chris chen?
01:50:34 Was bailed out and I was like no wow
01:50:36 Wow damn
01:50:39 Uh-oh
01:50:41 So I'm sure I'm sure bailed back in did you hear she was bail japed?
01:50:48 Now you're interested. Uh, I'm not interested in a heartache. Yeah
01:50:53 Uh to beat bail japed is to be put in a prison surrounded by lava
01:50:59 That's probably what should have been done
01:51:03 Uh, but I just uh, yeah people said gino samuel ai'd me and I was like, okay. All right fine
01:51:10 Just have just have your way with me then
01:51:13 If you do it do what you must
01:51:16 Uh
01:51:18 It's fine
01:51:20 Uh, it seems it seems like there was no like uh, the the particular
01:51:26 The mockery or humiliation perpetrated so can't really complain
01:51:31 Uh, and that's all I had to say
01:51:33 About my week really that's the end of my
01:51:36 List of things
01:51:38 All right, I think I had something else to say but I forgot it
01:51:43 Uh-oh
01:51:44 I was talking about anime. Oh my oh my yeah, it's a gun smoke
01:51:49 Uh, I got oh, I got mine mine arrived
01:51:52 During the stream. I think it was during the draw stream and you were there in the chat and I said
01:51:56 I found it in a box on my
01:51:59 counter in the front hall
01:52:01 I have it right here. I can see it right now. It's on my table. Have you read it? Have you read the new chapter?
01:52:06 Read the new chapter. Yeah, it's got the first four chapters in
01:52:13 That's the that's the idea is that you can see I thought
01:52:18 The fourth chapter if you pay early
01:52:21 That that was my my relationship. I didn't I didn't realize there was new content in in the book
01:52:26 I wonder how many people didn't realize I didn't realize that. Okay. Well, I'll have to read it now. Okay. Um, yeah, it's it's
01:52:33 The way I'm gonna do things going forward is gonna be like I'll make the chapter
01:52:38 Post it on, you know, amazon
01:52:41 pdf kofi so people can pay for the privilege to see it first
01:52:46 And also that's just nice. Thank you. Um, and then
01:52:50 Uh, it'll come out on the perfect comic party and then it'll come out on my website
01:52:55 So it'll be like staggered release
01:52:59 Okay
01:53:01 That's the way I want to do things. Oh also my patreon. I guess I don't know how that's gonna work. I want to give them something for it
01:53:09 But I don't know if I want to just give them the chapter maybe like
01:53:14 To get it before my website
01:53:17 or something
01:53:23 Anyway, uh, I got some new orders today just I refreshed I got two more
01:53:29 Based total orders 33 33 books. I got four books today
01:53:35 You know, I hope I hope they continue to to trickle in
01:53:39 Oh, we got a new one from canada. So canadian's gotten a getting gonna get a print clorissa gunsmoke
01:53:46 Uh-oh
01:53:47 uh-oh
01:53:49 We got united station at a kingdom australia germany japan and canada those are that's uh six countries
01:53:56 That my book is in it's so cool and so easy
01:54:01 I know
01:54:03 Did I did I complain on here that amazon doesn't let me print in landscape format?
01:54:08 I don't know if you mentioned it. Uh, I remember you're saying that somewhere
01:54:12 I I might have said it in the stream or I might have just messaged you about it because like yeah, uh, I looked into the amazon printing and
01:54:20 Printing my book would cost it would be about 19
01:54:25 19 to 20 dollars
01:54:28 Just like to print and ship it which is like
01:54:32 Say it does that saves me money
01:54:36 If I if I if I only printed a certain amount if I printed enough it would eventually become cheaper than that for me
01:54:43 To ship to america, but not to ship abroad
01:54:47 It would never it would never become cheaper than that to ship abroad
01:54:50 But so there's like a potential monetary benefit there to using the amazon and of course the the fact that it's just easier
01:54:57 but
01:54:58 They don't give me that much freedom in terms of choosing like book size
01:55:03 That so that I can't print in the size and landscape configuration that I wanted and there's a couple other little
01:55:08 Niggling issues too like the fact that they don't let me uh, they don't let me put
01:55:14 Uh, they don't let me print on the inside cover
01:55:18 Which is I mean, it's not that big a deal, but like, you know, the other company will let me
01:55:23 Oh, yeah
01:55:26 The back cover of the things. Yeah. Yeah the the interior side of the of the cover is just you know in in mine
01:55:33 That's where I put like, you know copyright information and like a little bit of credits stuff and
01:55:39 You know just looks nice
01:55:40 it looks nice because like in because uh
01:55:44 Simon punishment like the pages are black like everything is black and it's it's like colored print on black
01:55:49 Background so, you know, it just looks nice to have the inside cover black as well. I can't do that on amazon
01:55:55 I see yes
01:55:57 I guess that's just because i'm very like
01:56:00 particular with how uh, I set this
01:56:03 book up
01:56:04 No, yeah, the amazon is is like it's quality
01:56:09 To a point. I don't think you can really do like bespoke luxury goods in terms of print on demand
01:56:15 Yeah, you can make
01:56:17 Books honestly printed somewhere else and then sell them through amazon
01:56:21 I think if I didn't if if I if my book were a little more normal looking
01:56:25 I I think I probably might do it like like for the vapors or something
01:56:30 Like if I ever made like maybe a vapors volume
01:56:34 You know, uh
01:56:35 Put them all together. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
01:56:42 Because that I wouldn't care about like printing on the inside cover or landscape orientation or whatever
01:56:50 Oh, I think I may have already mentioned this but I can't wait
01:56:54 I can't wait to be able to make a volume in the same shape as all the manga volumes
01:57:01 If I have enough pages of like Clarissa
01:57:04 Probably Clarissa at the end like I'll just have a little tiny baby version
01:57:09 If you want a tiny baby manga version of Clarissa gunsmoat, I want to make that
01:57:14 Because I just want to have that I just want to have like it with like the the low quality paper as well
01:57:19 Isn't it just the same but smaller
01:57:21 It would be the same but smaller. No, well, it would be not just volume one
01:57:24 I would do like all the volumes like the whole Clarissa every all the chapters together
01:57:29 So you would so you if you made like an omnibus, you would just make it small
01:57:34 Well, I would probably make like a large one or the one that's the same size as like the other ones
01:57:40 But then I just really I just really want a small like the idea of a manga size. That's funny
01:57:45 Yeah, I get why not. Yeah, maybe some people would prefer it in manga size
01:57:49 Yeah, and the the fun thing about that is that I can just put it on Amazon for no
01:57:54 Like I don't have to pay a commission for it to be listed. I just put it up there
01:57:58 So even if nobody buys that one, I can buy it and I can have it and it's like it's for me
01:58:06 Okay, I get you I get you dog. Uh, yeah, why not?
01:58:13 Why not have it in multiple sizes?
01:58:16 um
01:58:17 It'll also be very cheap because like the the manga
01:58:19 volumes they use that slightly
01:58:22 Lower grade like cream paper instead of white paper. So it'd be like a little rougher
01:58:28 And it'll be like a little I don't know nostalgic. I guess I've got like manga volumes from years and years and years ago
01:58:35 of like Dragon Ball and I'm like, ah
01:58:38 The the ink's fading. This is so cool
01:58:43 Uh like an ancient tome
01:58:46 The pages they're they're all dog-eared and fallen out like oh, but that's just the authentic manga experience
01:58:51 They're they're all going like crusty brown-ish
01:58:55 Sun baked a little bit
01:58:59 More like sun-based hot hot. Yeah
01:59:03 Yeah, that's right. So yeah, I'm gonna I have been sort of using my kindle
01:59:08 um management thing
01:59:10 Link in the description to buy gibbs book Clarissa gunsmoke volume one get a copy get a copy and if you don't
01:59:19 If you don't want a if you can't afford or you don't want a physical version you can go to the co-fi
01:59:25 Right. I also have if you go to gibb and take that site you can there's like links for for both versions
01:59:34 I don't know where I'm gonna put it. I have I have like a drawer that I keep a bunch of like
01:59:39 Comics that I've purchased from people's kick starters and stuff. So I'll probably put it with those
01:59:44 Along with my problem sleuth volumes, etc. Yes when I make a bell jpeh book
01:59:49 I'm also going to make it similar science to problem sleuth
01:59:53 And even if nobody buys that it's like I mean it's a lot of work to make it into a book
01:59:58 So I hope people buy it when I do that, but it's
02:00:03 uh having
02:00:06 I finished I finished organizing the book version of slime and punishment and like I I still don't feel like I'm done
02:00:12 I'm still thinking like maybe I should shrink it a little more like maybe I should uh
02:00:18 Maybe maybe I should add a couple more like pieces of like fan art in the index that I forgot to include
02:00:23 Uh, maybe I could shrink the text more and and squeeze it into fewer pages
02:00:27 uh
02:00:30 It's literally harder than drawing the panels is just putting the panels on the page is the actual hard part
02:00:37 And as my biscuit page is hard even though I draw it like a fucking baby scribbling
02:00:44 It's because the scribbling is the easy part
02:00:46 Yeah, I I I reference the homestuck volume and the problem sleuth volumes
02:00:50 I have a lot to figure out when I when I was doing the pages I have like a
02:00:57 Like a photoshop document of like bell jpeh in book form
02:01:00 But I'll need to check with amazon what the sizes are so I can I'll have to move everything around probably
02:01:07 Yeah
02:01:10 Oh, it's exciting though. I love books. I love physical media
02:01:15 Uh, I feel you know, I had to I had to put I had to put my printing aside for a moment
02:01:21 For the slime and punishment to get the perfect comic party set up, but that's okay
02:01:26 Uh, biscuit page is all important too. And now that I'm back in the swing of it. I'm glad that I did
02:01:32 uh, but
02:01:35 I'm excited for my book as well. Uh, that'll be pretty cool
02:01:40 Maybe they'll sell a million copies. Maybe I'll make a hundred thousand dollars on Kickstarter
02:01:46 Oh, thank god, and then maybe I'll finally like the face that I see in the mirror
02:01:53 Nah, you'll be able to plate it gold. Hmm
02:01:57 gold face
02:01:59 Hey guys notice anything different about me. Hey, homa. You're the biggest man in the world now and you played it in gold
02:02:08 Remember that
02:02:10 Yes, that iconic simpson scene great. Yes. He said he first says like, uh, I don't know homo. You got a new haircut
02:02:17 Look closer, Lenny. Oh, yeah
02:02:21 The biggest man you're the biggest man in the world
02:02:24 Because you got lots of money and now you're huge
02:02:30 Uh
02:02:35 I have food now there was food given to me. That's great. So I will make noises with my mouth. I will mute myself a bit
02:02:43 Uh, I don't really have anything else to talk about for this. Yeah. Um, I think maybe we could go to voicemails
02:02:50 Okay, uh, but let me go to the bathroom real quick. All right. I'm gonna take a hiatus
02:02:59 So
02:03:13 All right, uh, I'm back
02:03:17 You there. Mm-hmm. I am still here. You're still here. All right. Well, hey, we're
02:03:23 damn
02:03:25 Depending on how long these voicemails take we're on track for an under three hour episode if you can even believe such a thing
02:03:31 You know what that'd be great. That's horrifying. I can't I I I don't I don't even know our audience will riot
02:03:38 Our audience and we will feast we will feast on all the free time that we've saved for ourselves
02:03:44 Yes, I need that. I need so much free time. I'm I know no more seven hour episodes, please
02:03:52 Translate it it literally translates directly into like more biscapades done. Yeah, more biscapades. That's what I'm gonna do. Yeah
02:04:00 Uh, all right more healthy hearty happy hosts
02:04:05 And you want that don't you?
02:04:08 No, they want us to suffer. That's that's why they watch
02:04:12 All right first voicemail
02:04:15 Oh
02:04:17 Gotta open up speak pipe
02:04:20 Okay
02:04:22 Well, the the first one is just a twitter meme
02:04:25 Say the line luffy
02:04:30 What does what does that mean? I'm gonna be the pirate king probably kaizuku is the pirate
02:04:35 king
02:04:36 Yeah
02:04:38 Oh, or it doesn't mean pirates kaizuku is pirate
02:04:41 I feel like the funny the funniest part of this meme is the fact that luffy's iconic like bursting out of the barrel
02:04:47 Like is posed in the same way as all the kids in the classroom. That's the only that's the only thing that saves this meme
02:04:54 The fact that the he's they're asking him to say the line and he's just happy to do so and he's happy and everyone's happy
02:05:00 I love to say the line
02:05:03 Uh
02:05:05 Next one is oh
02:05:08 Sorry, no good voicemails this week either. Who is this?
02:05:12 Is it a postman could this be could this be the voicemailer?
02:05:19 Is this a self portrait maybe
02:05:22 What had it what hat is that?
02:05:25 Where who wears a hat like that?
02:05:27 Um, now we'll see now. We'll get some good ones. No, no, no, we're we're we're gonna make it
02:05:32 Uh, next one is
02:05:34 Write a tweet in the style of act drill about ben saint
02:05:38 I asked ben saint what his favorite color was and he said the void
02:05:42 This man is a walking black hole and I mean that in the best way possible. Hashtag bless hashtag ben saint
02:05:52 That's good void void void void. Yes. I'm into it. This man is a walking black hole
02:06:02 I don't I have no idea what that means
02:06:06 It's pretty drill like
02:06:09 Um, uh kind of yeah a little bit. Um, it's a little out uncharacteristic of drill to be so positive about someone
02:06:17 Yes, it's also like a little bit too coherent
02:06:21 It's a little bit too like spelled correctly and like sounds normal
02:06:26 Um, but um hashtag blessed hashtag ben saint. Yeah, true other with that true
02:06:32 Uh, okay next one is called mad from cars suck at gmail.com
02:06:39 three two one go
02:06:42 Hey, so y'all were always or are always like oh post food post leave can't wait to change my body to
02:06:52 robotics stuff
02:06:54 Iro guys post car too
02:06:56 Because a lot of younglings of my age like have no interest in owning a car and stuff
02:07:03 Like I hate traveling too. I
02:07:08 I'm never traveling again. Fuck you mom. I'm never going
02:07:13 I have no interest in cars
02:07:15 Yeah, I hate cars
02:07:17 I'm I'm happy to that's literally why I live in boston is so I don't need a car
02:07:21 I feel like I can just take the bus everywhere. Yeah, that's why I like living in london as well
02:07:25 It's like yeah, there's buses everywhere. There's trains like so far into london beyond it's like
02:07:32 such a hub such a hub of
02:07:34 Going to places like literally almost I mean not every day, but like most days I hear
02:07:40 Not not the roommate that knows my videos
02:07:43 But two of my other roommates I hear one of them come upstairs and knock on the other one's door and be like
02:07:48 Hey, man, can you move your car so I can pull out
02:07:51 And it's like I would kill myself. I couldn't I couldn't deal with that every imagine
02:07:56 It's like one of them has to move their car for the other guy or the other guy has to move it for the one guy
02:08:01 They're just they're big and cumbersome. They're expensive. So if something happens to them, it's really bad
02:08:06 You have to pay insurance just to own them
02:08:09 You have to pay more money just to operate them in gas
02:08:12 You have to get them in for repairs every now and then I can't even be bothered to get my human body in for repairs
02:08:18 As often as it needs
02:08:20 I don't need a freaking mechanical thing dragging me down even more. I I would I I hate I literally hate cars
02:08:26 I hate them. I'm so grateful that I don't have to be fucking yoked with one
02:08:32 I feel sorry for anyone that does
02:08:34 And if I want to like feel the experience of driving
02:08:39 Um, I could just play a video game that does that and I can drive off a cliff. You can't do that in real life
02:08:45 Uh, if I that's what I would do if I were a dirty filthy car owner
02:08:50 I would drive up a mountain
02:08:52 And like in gta and I would and I would jump out of the like I would drive off cliff jump out of the door
02:08:59 And I would get my parachute when my bazooka
02:09:02 when I was at
02:09:04 astro camp
02:09:05 Uh, the drive up the mountain to astro camp. I mean some parts of it had guardrails on it
02:09:11 some did not and like
02:09:14 Some parts you were kind of close like the road went kind of close to an edge that like
02:09:19 You would die you would go over the edge and you would fall a long way and die
02:09:24 And it was really scary
02:09:26 uh
02:09:27 That's not really the car is fault, but i'm gonna blame the car for that anyway
02:09:32 I do like the the um the experience of being driven sometimes like on like a cool
02:09:39 I don't like country trail that you couldn't reasonably walk to
02:09:43 And there's no trains like when when infrastructure falls away
02:09:47 It is nice to have a little bit of a car moment, but like
02:09:52 Not for the not like you don't need them in the city
02:09:55 We don't need motorways as much as we think we do
02:09:59 I don't I don't really like the car moment. I don't really like the experience of being in a car with people
02:10:06 Honestly, I guess right driving by myself is like it's okay. I've done it before and
02:10:11 It's not that bad other than the fact that driving is dangerous
02:10:15 And I feel like I am extending my potential life expectancy by avoiding it as much as possible
02:10:20 The experience of driving by myself. Okay the experience of being in a car with people. I don't like it. It's awkward
02:10:27 I I would agree. I think it's it's just the sort of like um
02:10:32 The the independence you have with a car to go to various locations is cool
02:10:38 Yeah, it's just the fact that
02:10:41 it's so
02:10:43 Like people who own cars don't all go on cool road trips off-road to amazing places
02:10:48 They usually just have a car and then they use it to go to like go and yeah to go into normal places
02:10:54 It's a waste if you get a car you should have an adventure
02:10:58 You should not replace your
02:11:01 Like use it as a replacement for a bus because buses is easy. You just get on
02:11:06 And I mean I get my groceries delivered and that costs me more than buying groceries regular
02:11:12 I guess theoretically I could save money on groceries if I drove to the store and bought them myself
02:11:17 But then I'd have to pay for car insurance and gas to do it. It would probably like not even make up the difference
02:11:23 Uh
02:11:25 I think if you're in a car you should go on like the cool you could go on on a magical adventure
02:11:29 I think that's the only reason you should have a car
02:11:32 You should go on a fucking jeep drive through the Sahara desert or not
02:11:38 Sahara desert as savannah african savannah and see the lions
02:11:42 I feel like there are other kinds of magical adventure
02:11:46 That I could do carless and I think I would probably pick one of those
02:11:50 Oh, yeah, I mean there's lots of adventures you could do but if you if you had a car
02:11:56 That's that's the that's the morally correct way to justify it for you
02:12:00 If they used it for that if they if they said they were gonna do that and they just never did then it's like
02:12:06 Oh, yeah, well, you're wasting a lot of money betrayal betrayal
02:12:11 Uh, okay, I guess we're I guess we're pretty much on the same page. Yep. Fuck cars
02:12:17 Wars walk wars
02:12:19 Fuck fuck fuck and fuck you
02:12:23 Uh listener, uh the next one is uh from prince isolation. It's an image
02:12:28 Sorry pinkie, but I just don't get what's so darn funny about a farm supply store
02:12:33 What does it matter what the previous owner was called? Uh
02:12:37 Uh, oh is that the
02:12:40 The chuck suck and fuck. Yeah. Yeah, you mean sneeze feed and seed. Uh, whoops whoopsie
02:12:48 I saw I saw a chat gpt to failing to explain why sneeze feed and seed joke is funny
02:12:55 Uh, that was kind of that was pretty good. Uh, okay next one is from prince isolation
02:13:04 Okay, so this is this is me
02:13:09 I was asking people in my discord like
02:13:12 I I asked you the same thing about like shipping to the uk because I thought it might save money to have the books
02:13:17 Shipped to a country or to the eu or to south america and then have a guy
02:13:23 Or somebody in that region who would then
02:13:26 Send the individual ones for me and I maybe I could just pay someone to do that. So I was asking around in my discord
02:13:34 And then uh, okay
02:13:36 So, uh, here here I am you're in chile, right? I got a question for you
02:13:39 How much would it cost you to mail a one kilogram package from where you are to someone in another country in south america?
02:13:46 I asked alias. I said it would cost him like 50 plus from argentina, which is insane
02:13:51 I guess anyone in south america could theoretically answer this question
02:13:55 we've got the
02:13:59 I'm making drugs. I'm making drugs
02:14:02 Yeah, you know, uh, was it gustavo fring is from chile, I think
02:14:07 Uh, is that right? I don't remember
02:14:10 well
02:14:11 Here I am making drugs with slime gusts and slime jesse and slime waltz and they're they're jealous
02:14:18 And this is what my room actually looks like pouring like liquids into beakers
02:14:22 That are glowing. Oh, um, yeah, uh, one of those beakers that had the um
02:14:29 The alcohol solution of the glowing, uh, quinine that I had extracted from the
02:14:36 That I had extracted from the diet tonic
02:14:39 Uh, one of the the alcohol eventually evaporated off and it started growing mold
02:14:43 So that I need to get rid of that. Uh, I just noticed that yesterday. It's like dammit
02:14:48 Dammit, but I got to examine it under the black light. I wonder if the mold would grow would glow
02:14:53 Probably not there'd probably like a layer of the of the glowing stuff underneath it and the mold is just like on top of it
02:14:59 is this slime to be
02:15:02 What was the slime for just it was that to put on your teeth or like the stuff you were gonna put in the bottles
02:15:07 The original idea was that I was going to cook it down into something that I could paint my teeth with to make them glow
02:15:13 Uh, that is like not
02:15:15 There's such simpler ways of doing that so I'm not gonna do that anymore now
02:15:20 I was just like cook it down to just see what happens and
02:15:23 turns out what happens is
02:15:25 Uh mold starts to grow on it when you let it grow until the alcohol evaporates. Yep
02:15:33 Now I know, uh
02:15:36 Next
02:15:38 Next one is uh another image. It's an album
02:15:42 Uh, I love images. Oh wait, wait, wait, wait. That one had an audio with it. I forgot. Oh, okay. Three two one go
02:15:49 Yeah, this is the most shy drawing I've ever done, but I just needed to get the thought out there
02:15:54 Okay, it's fine. I am not sorry
02:15:59 It's a good drawing prince. Uh next one is um an album
02:16:05 Let's see
02:16:08 Uh
02:16:11 No, Ben sainte supports non consensuals
02:16:18 You do
02:16:21 It's not for me to have sex with someone it's two other people
02:16:27 You do this is exactly
02:16:31 It's exactly what happens. It's exactly how I would act in that situation. Yeah, I would think
02:16:36 Let's let's let's let's intervene and fix this problem. We got a problem here and I got the solution
02:16:42 Something funny just about the because these two people they're lying down on the bed
02:16:47 And but you're standing straight up like next to the bed. I just walked past them
02:16:53 You do actually actually, uh, I think uh
02:16:57 Uh
02:17:00 Thank you for that. Uh next one is called pretty good at I love card games at gmail.com
02:17:06 three two one go
02:17:09 You two are probably already occupied with trash. I mean games like fire and the mega man
02:17:15 But if anyone wants to ruin their own life
02:17:18 Check out monster train
02:17:22 No, so train
02:17:23 No
02:17:25 I've already got a bunch of bad games that I don't like
02:17:28 Even aside the ones that i'm contractually obligated to play monster train. Uh, it's got like it's got like the the the color
02:17:36 red and blue
02:17:38 Is that a problem?
02:17:40 Well, it's it just sort of is the the main thing that every
02:17:45 video game looks like on the cover
02:17:49 Of this one's this one's a better image
02:17:51 My first impression is oh, it's home. It's hearthstone and it's also generic in other ways
02:17:56 It does look generic. It does look like hearthstone. I mean the yeah, I know a lot of people use the orange and blue like whatever
02:18:05 I'll never use orange and blue ever. This is a terrible voicemail. This is a terrible voicemail
02:18:10 Just like hey, have you heard of this game?
02:18:13 One no and you didn't even tell me what I why I should care about it
02:18:18 Why even why?
02:18:20 Oh
02:18:23 We're in your life
02:18:25 This is an awful voicemail. It's a waste of my time. Um, next one is uh called
02:18:31 Well, it's uh god. It means a youtube link. Um, I said
02:18:36 Hey, you missed one. There's another image. Wait, did I? Oh, yeah

02:18:51 No, not the pretty dress. I guess in my coco pomel
02:18:56 Uh, give and take review
02:18:59 Uh, where I had a little of something guesting. I think
02:19:04 They did the art
02:19:06 And there was a joke about a pretty dress and I said no
02:19:09 Oh
02:19:12 Well now yes, yeah, I get it
02:19:14 This is just like the end of the witch when the devil asks would you like a pretty dress?
02:19:19 Would sell like a pretty dress
02:19:21 Would sell like the taste of butter would sell like to see the world. I think that's what he has. Yes to all three
02:19:28 Yes, please
02:19:29 I love butter
02:19:32 I do
02:19:33 I wonder how many other things like that there are of me saying no, I would never be a female
02:19:38 Uh, I don't remember that video in particular
02:19:44 But I would never want to wear lipstick
02:19:48 True
02:19:49 Okay, next one is uh
02:19:53 It's a youtube link. It's a it's a it's a geo center. It's a seven
02:20:00 Okay, it's a it's a it's a flat earth conspiracy thing. Who cares? Okay
02:20:04 Uh, next next one next one is goku sucks three two one go
02:20:10 All right, you guys are artists, right? No
02:20:14 The real question is
02:20:16 How many of our original characters can beat goku? I have
02:20:21 at least
02:20:23 Five so so
02:20:27 None
02:20:29 None of my original characters can be goku
02:20:32 Yeah, I guess I can't mine can't either so but but Clarissa has a gun she can shoot him
02:20:39 She could just shoot him
02:20:42 You ever think about that? It's true. Mm-hmm. It's like launch
02:20:46 Yeah
02:20:47 Did you I was looking at launch talking about baby goku?
02:20:51 Yeah, baby goku. I mean if you got the if he got the right beast the beast hustler could maybe give baby goku a run for his money
02:20:58 Yes
02:20:59 But like launch in in dragon ball the lady who sneezes and changes her personality in her hair color
02:21:05 Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I love I love launch
02:21:08 She I realized uh, not too like just the other day when I was looking for some reason at at her
02:21:15 I was like wait, that's the reason I like girls with guns. That's the reason I like like the idea of gun girl
02:21:21 She's blonde and she's got a gun and she hates you. That's funny. I like blue hair launch
02:21:27 I don't like blonde launch
02:21:29 I I like both of them
02:21:31 They're so pretty. I like I like the I like the blue one. I like the one that's nice
02:21:36 Actually, I have just like marge simpson just like just like marge simpson. Yes
02:21:42 What if marge simpson sneezes and turns into
02:21:47 Lisa uh lisa lisa's blonde. I just I just I just now have realized that
02:21:53 Why are they blonde are the simpson's are the simpson's kids blonde? Is that what they're
02:21:58 I mean, they they do not have a different color from their skin color
02:22:04 Hair, they do not have brown hair. Homer had brown hair
02:22:09 They do not have a marge had blue hair so marge was it
02:22:13 Yeah, when she was a teenager it was blue
02:22:16 But did she always dye it? I forgot if that was ever like established that she has a canon real hair color
02:22:22 Uh, she dyes it blue now, but when we see her as a kid, it's still blue. So I mean
02:22:30 I don't think she was dying it ever since she was a kid
02:22:33 Oh, yeah, and our dad had blue hair. Yeah, so that that's just a thing not not not in every time we see him
02:22:38 I think there's at least one time we see him when he had although that might have been when he was old his hair might
02:22:44 I feel like the one where we see him and he's an a flight attendant. He had brown hair
02:22:49 But I think there's another one where we see him with patty and selma and he had like you had like light blue hair
02:22:55 I feel like it's inconsistent with with mr. Bouvier
02:22:58 I am pretty sure the flight
02:23:01 Oh clancy Bouvier. He's got orange hair
02:23:04 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, that's true. Yeah, and I'm seeing the different images now
02:23:09 knew it
02:23:11 Because I watched I watched that uh, that uh, who's that one simpsons tuber?
02:23:16 Real gyms. I'll watch the real gyms video about the mr. Bouvier
02:23:21 So I know this look at the back of my hand
02:23:25 Um, yeah, but gun girl is his lunch
02:23:29 She shoots you she doesn't change her personality. I guess she does. I guess she does shoot me
02:23:34 Yeah, she shoots you with angry eyes. It's like the perfect woman
02:23:40 True
02:23:41 I love a girl who'll
02:23:43 shoot me
02:23:44 Uh, next one is called. Um
02:23:48 Wait a second. I didn't download that one. Next one is called a lost vagrant husk
02:23:52 3 2 1 go
02:23:56 When I saw the ova
02:23:59 I thought that what I desired was
02:24:03 Nate
02:24:05 But I realized something
02:24:09 Nate has not been here for years
02:24:13 What I saw it was
02:24:17 nearly a
02:24:18 simulacrum
02:24:20 The memory of him
02:24:23 Is dust in the wind
02:24:25 being grown away
02:24:28 Where they ever crushing
02:24:30 obsession of
02:24:32 time
02:24:34 I
02:24:36 Had an epiphany
02:24:38 I no longer crave
02:24:41 for
02:24:43 succulents
02:24:46 Ben
02:24:48 I have lost
02:24:50 my purpose
02:24:52 What am I to do now?
02:24:54 That I no longer desire to
02:24:57 fuck
02:24:59 a member
02:25:00 of
02:25:01 the
02:25:02 PCB
02:25:04 Well, you better figure it out before find purpose november rolls around. Oh my god. Yeah, remember that
02:25:10 Wait to find my purpose. Yeah
02:25:12 It's a few months away. So you got time, but uh
02:25:16 Don't dilly dally because if you end no no find purpose november with no purpose
02:25:22 The freaking uh, the the collectors come around like in homestuck and they say spit your purpose into this bucket
02:25:28 And if you don't they kill you
02:25:31 Uh true true
02:25:33 So, you know, I I thought he was gonna say he wanted to fuck you
02:25:37 Yeah, but now now he now he just has no one to want to fuck. No, it was it was it was Nate or nothing
02:25:46 As the saying truly a tragic tale
02:25:50 Uh, next one is called hey gibb comma three two one go
02:25:55 Hey gibb, how do you feel when people sexualize you on the internet?
02:25:58 I would ask ben but he already violates enough social contracts that I have no respect for him. Mm-hmm
02:26:04 I
02:26:06 Honestly don't like it all that much
02:26:09 Hmm. I think
02:26:11 It's it's fine up to a point
02:26:14 But like weird comments. I've actually got a few weird comments. I just like
02:26:19 so like
02:26:21 You're a little presuming that I would be like just fine with you saying that
02:26:26 Are you talking about on twitter or in youtube comments on twitter? I don't think I've seen that many youtube comments
02:26:32 maybe a couple um
02:26:35 And I guess I guess the the guy who does the voicemails where it's like whenever
02:26:40 It's like oh, I saw gibb on twitter and he does like a oh come thing. That's his voicemail gimmick
02:26:46 Uh, not a big fan of that but like
02:26:49 It's obviously a goof. It's just sort of like ick
02:26:52 A little bit achy. Yeah
02:26:54 Yeah
02:26:56 I feel you dog
02:26:59 um
02:27:00 Okay, and that's the answer next one is how to penetrate a social group
02:27:08 Uh, wait, let me download that last one. Okay download how to penetrate a social group three two one go
02:27:14 Okay, so let's say
02:27:17 you um are
02:27:18 know somewhere
02:27:21 And you don't know anyone there and everyone there knows each other like
02:27:25 How are you supposed to um
02:27:28 Interact in such a scenario like
02:27:33 Um, are you supposed to like I don't really
02:27:38 I mean, so it's a tough
02:27:40 Question you just got it. You just got a pipe. You just got to find something to say
02:27:44 You just got to think of something. I mean a lot of the time
02:27:47 I have a lot of trouble with this when like everyone knows each other and I'm like, okay
02:27:51 I know what I should do is like engage with a conversation. They're already having
02:27:56 um
02:27:57 But then they end up talking about nothing that I care about and I'm like, you know what I don't care
02:28:01 Like it's I should I should try a little harder. I guess if if they're already having a conversation
02:28:07 I wouldn't necessarily say like butt into it
02:28:10 Well, no, but like sometimes they're always they're always having a conversation with each other and you're never like considered
02:28:16 so
02:28:17 Yeah, you have to try and worm your way in somehow by either
02:28:21 being something like a subject of the conversation or by just
02:28:24 Having a quip having a point on what they were saying. Oh, I heard you were talking about this
02:28:29 Did you know or like just I don't know. It's difficult
02:28:32 It sucks
02:28:34 you you kind of yeah, you kind of just got to try and uh
02:28:39 You kind of just got to look for an opening and just say something
02:28:43 And uh, you know, I guess if you're there for like first impressions
02:28:48 Yeah, first impressions are like people say first impressions are very important
02:28:52 and the reason I
02:28:54 I don't think people like say this part because I didn't get it for a while
02:28:59 The reason the first impressions are important is that's the only time that it seems normal
02:29:04 to talk about yourself
02:29:06 And what you do and who you are and what you like because if you know them from like having seen them already
02:29:12 And you just sort of say hello every so often
02:29:14 It is weird to suddenly come up to them
02:29:17 Unprompted and start talking about what you like and asking them questions. I mean, it's not impossible
02:29:22 But it's sort of the weird, you know, it's weirder to say it after you've met them
02:29:26 Then well while you're meeting them, you know, I guess so. Yeah
02:29:30 um
02:29:31 Because once they know things about you they can think about you
02:29:36 um
02:29:37 When topics of conversation come up and think to include you or like to talk to you about something because they already know stuff
02:29:43 I would say that if you're talking about be you're in like a I don't know maybe like you
02:29:48 just
02:29:49 Joined a new school or something or you're in a new job or something
02:29:53 uh, I would say
02:29:56 First thing is is don't be weird
02:29:59 and don't
02:30:01 Like you do want to like eventually break into the conversation and think of something and say something
02:30:05 But you don't want to be weird about it
02:30:07 So like I would say just be chill and like if there's if if they're not talking about anything you have anything to say about
02:30:14 And there's nothing and you don't see any natural
02:30:19 Way of like opening a conversation
02:30:21 Don't force it
02:30:23 And because you'll be weird about it if you just like be okay with like not saying anything
02:30:28 Because it's normal to not have anything to say to people you don't know just be fine with that
02:30:33 But if you see an opportunity or you see something you have an observation to make about or they're talking about something you have an interest in
02:30:39 It's okay to pipe up and be like, hey, I have a thing to say about that
02:30:44 Yeah, don't yeah
02:30:46 It's it's always weird when the person is hovering because nobody draws attention to it
02:30:50 But everyone can know
02:30:52 Everyone notices when somebody's hovering around a conversation and not involving themselves
02:30:57 If you're just chill and doing your own thing like I was imagining it like a work environment if you're at a new job
02:31:03 You're all there to do work. So it's not weird that you're in airshot of whatever they're doing
02:31:09 Yeah, but like if it's more of a social setting
02:31:12 It is odd to just go up to the group and
02:31:17 Hang around
02:31:19 Yeah, you definitely do not want to be some freaking uh silent orbiter
02:31:24 That's not good
02:31:26 Uh next one if you're gonna orbit you should do it in outer wilds
02:31:32 Hey, honey, uh, did you bathe you smell great? Did you bathe? No, I used the Orion scent
02:31:39 Well, may I orbit your belt?
02:31:42 Sonichu
02:31:44 next one

02:42:49 Hey, come on.
02:42:51 Hey, come on.
02:42:53 Who among us?
02:42:55 Who among us has not been cringe in the past?
02:42:57 Right.
02:42:59 True.
02:43:01 I do not say it anymore.
02:43:03 I don't say it anymore.
02:43:07 We left it behind.
02:43:09 It was everyone else's fault.
02:43:11 Everyone else was just a bad influence on me.
02:43:13 Ben, you're like the oldest.
02:43:15 You're like the oldest one.
02:43:17 Yeah, but that doesn't mean I'm the smartest
02:43:19 or that I have the most
02:43:21 resilience to peer pressure.
02:43:23 Certainly not.
02:43:25 None of us have like the we were just too young to understand.
02:43:27 No, we don't.
02:43:29 Except for Munchie.
02:43:31 Except for Munchie, yeah.
02:43:33 And none of us stopped him.
02:43:35 Well, hey.
02:43:37 I'd live and learn.
02:43:39 Live and learn.
02:43:41 As I go.
02:43:43 Hanging on the edge of tomorrow.
02:43:45 No, the sonic one.
02:43:47 Yeah, live and learn.
02:43:49 Yesterday.
02:43:51 Yeah.
02:43:53 I forgot that part.
02:43:55 If you beg or if you borrow,
02:43:57 something find a way.
02:43:59 Right?
02:44:01 I'm pretty sure.
02:44:03 I don't know these things.
02:44:05 I'm a big sonic fan.
02:44:07 That's more sinful
02:44:09 than having said the N word a bunch of times.
02:44:11 I would agree.
02:44:13 Agree.
02:44:15 Did you see the sonic, the visual novel
02:44:17 that they just
02:44:19 released on April Fool's Day?
02:44:21 Yeah, the murder of Sonic.
02:44:23 I thought it was pretty funny.
02:44:25 Yeah, it was pretty funny.
02:44:27 I like when they do an April Fool's Day
02:44:29 and then they actually do it.
02:44:31 They didn't just do it.
02:44:33 Say it as a joke and then not make it.
02:44:35 No, they actually made a little game.
02:44:37 And that's cool.
02:44:39 I think I've had my April.
02:44:41 I hate April Fool's rant before,
02:44:43 so I don't need to say it again.
02:44:45 I don't really hate it so much
02:44:47 as I'm just
02:44:49 apathetic to the whole thing.
02:44:51 Just like, yeah, okay.
02:44:53 I don't think it's super amusing
02:44:55 to just see someone
02:44:57 and like, oh, hey, they posted a thing
02:44:59 that they would never say.
02:45:01 They're pretending they're going to do a thing
02:45:03 that they would never do.
02:45:07 Oh, it's misinformation.
02:45:09 Yes, I love the April Fool's.
02:45:11 Like, April Fool's,
02:45:13 even though some people just do
02:45:15 things that suck
02:45:17 and all that,
02:45:19 I do generally enjoy
02:45:21 the feeling that it's
02:45:25 a time where
02:45:27 everyone is on board with this one thing
02:45:29 and they're all doing something.
02:45:31 You know, it's a holiday
02:45:35 and everyone's taking part
02:45:37 and it just feels nice, I guess.
02:45:39 The only thing that sucks about April Fool's
02:45:41 is that for people
02:45:43 who don't upload a lot and then they suddenly upload,
02:45:45 it's just disappointing.
02:45:47 And then the next day,
02:45:49 all of the things in your feed are like,
02:45:51 oh, yeah, that was from yesterday.
02:45:53 That's a joke. Don't need to click on that.
02:45:55 It's probably not going to be funny.
02:45:57 That's a joke. That's a joke.
02:45:59 There's nothing to watch today.
02:46:03 Yeah, exactly.
02:46:05 When it's fake content,
02:46:07 when there's not real content,
02:46:09 people will say,
02:46:13 if they just said, oh, what if we made
02:46:15 this visual novel where you
02:46:17 solve the murder of Sonic the Hedgehog
02:46:19 as a joke, that would be lame.
02:46:21 It's cool that you can actually play it.
02:46:25 But I didn't play it because I don't care
02:46:27 that much, but I just thought it was nice.
02:46:29 And that's the last of the voicemails.
02:46:31 We're done.
02:46:35 Oh my goodness.
02:46:37 Plebenweeb.
02:46:39 Underneath three hours.
02:46:41 Plebenweeb, Blu-rays, they're free now.

02:46:51 Jesse and Trixie both have my permission
02:46:53 to make their own Blu-rays with the work
02:46:55 that I did for them. They will not
02:46:57 because they do not care.
02:46:59 Lamal.
02:47:01 I'm still looking at this version
02:47:03 in Saint vs. Chad Endless One and just seething
02:47:05 because it wasn't funny.
02:47:07 I thought it was going to be funny jokes, but no.
02:47:09 It's just some cringe, Lord.
02:47:11 Genuinely coping and seething and
02:47:13 malding about my
02:47:15 own, about my savage
02:47:17 own of their favorite idiot
02:47:19 that they probably
02:47:21 give money to on Patreon for some reason.
02:47:23 For 18 Let's Plays a Month.
