00:00:00 Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemail for the Minecraft stream.
00:00:08 I really want to have Redcon funded by you. We can be procrastinators.
00:00:18 Hello everyone. Welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm Ben
00:00:28 Saint and Gibbontake is here as well. I'm here. I'm also here. It's the two casts. We haven't had
00:00:36 one of these in a while. For some reason. It feels like we have had two casts. It hasn't been,
00:00:42 actually. There's been a guest or there's been Tom. There's been three for a while.
00:00:48 I think you're right. I think you're right, but I don't know why you would be right. Why would
00:00:56 you do this? I have to make up for last episode for being slightly wrong.
00:01:07 Too much benefit of doubt. I'm still not convinced Riley is like an evil mastermind.
00:01:16 I definitely gave him too much credence. I was too on the fence on that one, so that is my bad
00:01:22 a little bit. I think it's maybe giving him too much credit to think that he is like some kind
00:01:29 of mastermind or whatever. On the one hand, I am completely right and therefore the best thing
00:01:40 to do is agree with me unconditionally. On the other hand, I can't. I mean, agreeing with Ben
00:01:46 saying, could you imagine? On the other hand, every single comment,
00:01:51 every hundreds of comments in the last episode saying, God, I hate Ben, but he's so right.
00:01:57 Every single one. Yeah, those are funny. I have issue though. Here's an issue I got.
00:02:05 Wait, let me let me send it. I was going to say, on the other hand, I kind of understand if you
00:02:13 feel like you don't have all the sides, then don't not coming to any conclusions. I feel like you
00:02:19 should have had all the information. It was all there, but if you didn't have it, you didn't read
00:02:23 it, you never got around to it, then okay, fair enough. If you're like, well, I'll withhold judgment
00:02:30 until I'm satisfied. I don't think I was totally wrong, but I can see how people are like, oh,
00:02:35 that's cringe game. I'm like, yeah, sure, sure. Yeah, I can see both sides of that issue.
00:02:45 But yeah, the issue I have was with the group of commenters who were being like
00:02:52 outwardly, openly transphobic towards Trixie wanting to even towards me.
00:02:59 There were a handful. There were a handful of those and they were all bad.
00:03:03 I don't like that they're mixed in there. They're embarrassing. They're embarrassing when I see
00:03:09 that. It was really quite, you know, because they hear like, oh, a trans person doesn't like
00:03:16 people who are being transphobic or saying things and like, haha, whatever.
00:03:20 But like, there's two things to it, right? There's one, it's despicable, die, but also,
00:03:27 it sort of ruins their own argument against Trixie. Like, if you have problems with her,
00:03:35 like the trans stuff, it sort of like to include transphobia in there is like,
00:03:44 antithesis, it goes against your own argument because you're sort of muddying the waters with
00:03:49 stuff that actually doesn't have anything to do with it. Because they don't know what
00:03:54 people are, right? Did you even listen to the episode? Do you even know what's going on? Do you
00:04:00 even know what the actual problem is? Were you even paying attention? Yeah. Well, I think they
00:04:06 all know, right? It's just that they ascribe like being trans equals bad to that whole thing as well.
00:04:13 Like, oh, did you know Trixie? They kept saying did you? So I'm thinking about it. But like Trixie's
00:04:19 trans, therefore, she's stupid and would do all these things. Oh, that's why. Oh, that's why.
00:04:26 That's why she did all these stupid things and is a bad person.
00:04:29 It's like, it's, it betrays a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding of Trixie and also of,
00:04:36 you know, they don't know like the transfer perspective of trans people is just that they
00:04:43 don't understand what it is. Like, it's, they don't care to know what it is. And so they make
00:04:48 big assumptions, usually very negative ones about the, you know, trans people in general.
00:04:54 And it's like, if you know your shit, you realize that it has nothing to do with
00:04:59 the arguments against Trixie. And so it allows people who do know their shit about trans people
00:05:05 to dismiss arguments that include transphobia in them. So you're doing yourself a disservice.
00:05:10 Also, fuck you, because that's horrible. You shouldn't be your bigots. It's kind of a bad
00:05:15 thing to do. It's not great. It frustrates me because Trixie is legitimately delusional.
00:05:26 But when I say that, those people think I mean something else. They think I'm agreeing with
00:05:32 them about something that I do not agree with them about. It's just, it just comes from a
00:05:40 place of ignorance. And that's cringe, like on its own, aside from all the political stuff
00:05:45 around, you know, surrounding it. It's just stupid. It's just cringe on its own. Imagine,
00:05:52 imagine being like, they just don't know what words mean. They just haven't thought it through
00:06:04 and are like angry that like the world is more complicated than their sixth grade understanding
00:06:10 of things. That's, I feel, I would feel pity. I would feel pity if I didn't find them so
00:06:16 despicable and want them destroyed. Yeah. Yeah. And it's been like annoying because I like, I want
00:06:24 to like say yes, I agree with Ben. Yes, Trixie is bad. And then that's right. It's all the
00:06:33 things that people associate with that are assumed because a lot of this drama around Trixie,
00:06:38 if you didn't watch the last episode, go watch the last episode of the Progress News podcast
00:06:41 where we talk all about it. But like a lot of that stuff is on Kiwi Farms, which is like, you
00:06:47 know, like literal like scum fuck place website. Like you don't want to be there.
00:06:54 Those guys, it's, I've said, I've said this before, but those guys are so embarrassing because
00:06:59 like they pretend they have this very, very thin pretense of like, we do not take a side.
00:07:06 We do not, we are above petty concerns of like whether you call this person a he or a she.
00:07:14 It's totally fine to call them a he, even if they're a trans woman, because it doesn't matter.
00:07:18 Like call them whatever you want. But if you do that, if you don't do that, if you call them a
00:07:22 she, people in the thread will lambast you and make fun of you and demand that you stop. They get
00:07:28 upset, which is pretty cringe, pretty cringe, pretty cringe to be triggered by pronouns bro,
00:07:39 in my opinion. Yeah, that was basically it. It's just sort of like, I don't like that there's that
00:07:46 element of it. And I would encourage everyone who has a problem with Trixie to, you know,
00:07:52 not hold back just because you're afraid of being called a transphobe, just leave the transphobia
00:07:57 out if it's in any point part of your reason why Trixie is bad, because it's stupid. You don't know
00:08:03 what you're talking about with regards to that. It's, it's, yeah, it's, it's, it's, you're, I don't
00:08:13 know, if you think that's the problem, then you're just, you're just confused. You're just,
00:08:18 you're just confused because two things like happened at the same time. I don't know.
00:08:23 I mean, it's not like being trans is, is like, like, it's not like being trans is like,
00:08:36 like not indicative of anything like this completely the same. Like obviously,
00:08:40 she's changed a lot through going through this transition. She's changed her mind about certain
00:08:45 things. She's changed her perspective. But that's not like a blanket thing that is like, oh, trans
00:08:51 people, they change always for the bad. And that's why trans people are stupid and insane.
00:08:56 And it's like, no, that doesn't, it doesn't track in any way. Lots of people transition
00:09:01 in different ways. It's a very personal thing. It really has nothing to do with anything other
00:09:06 than the specific person that you're talking about. You know, anyone could be trans and they
00:09:11 will all transition in the way that they would, you know, because that's who they are.
00:09:16 I'm glad you brought this up. Most, most people commenting seem to be on board, but definitely,
00:09:22 definitely a handful were confused. They were confused. And, you know, it's good,
00:09:28 it's good to set them straight, set them on the right path, the far right path again.
00:09:34 No, that was so fucking funny. I listened back to most of the episode and that joke is like,
00:09:41 I don't know. So right. So right. So I'm so right. I'm alt right now. Dab, dab, dab.
00:09:51 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:09:57 I don't know. Yeah, that's about it. That's all I had to say on that topic. I didn't really want to
00:10:01 talk about drama all over again because it's like, no, not really. What else is there? What
00:10:06 else is there to really say about it? voicemails? No, Ben. Yes. Yes. What have you been doing the
00:10:15 past week? What's been going on in the same past week in the cathedral? Well, I mean,
00:10:22 I haven't really been. Oh, wait, Ben, happy birthday. Oh, yes. You had one of those. It was my
00:10:28 birthday four days ago as of this recording on the seventh. Yes. That was pretty, pretty good,
00:10:38 I guess. That was, yeah, they confined me now. I got a lot of, I got a couple of nice pieces of
00:10:47 birthday fan art on Twitter. Thank you to the people who made me those. I really liked all those.
00:10:54 I don't know. That was fine. I didn't really, I didn't really do anything. I did go and see
00:11:05 Munchy and Kazzy as a sort of late birthday hangout yesterday, and that was fine.
00:11:15 I don't know. I'm 33 and I'm dust and bones. I'm 33 and I'm drinking pee.
00:11:24 Yes, please. Ben, you look, you don't look a day over, you don't look a day over 32.
00:11:33 What's your secret? Well, zip, zip down and grab a, grab a bucket and a bucket.
00:11:43 Well, yeah, because you got to store it. You got to store it over long periods.
00:11:48 It, you know, you got to age it. I see. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it gets more powerful the longer it's,
00:11:55 it's steep. Terrible. Oh God, I'm gonna throw up. I'm gonna throw up just thinking about it.
00:12:03 Fuck, I don't even, what did I do? What did I do on my birth? Did I do anything? No. Did you wake up?
00:12:09 I did. I, unfortunately, I did. I feel like I'm forgetting something.
00:12:19 Oh, whatever. I got, I got that. Oh, Nate and Michelle called me. That was, that was cool.
00:12:25 I don't know. Whatever. It's fucking, I didn't do anything.
00:12:31 I found some new, there are some new energy drinks, though, that are, that exist now and
00:12:37 being out yesterday. We found some and I tried some and I didn't, I didn't love any of them. I was
00:12:45 really disappointed. Some of them had really cool flavor names, but they weren't that good.
00:12:49 Rain has a new flavor called white gummy bear, which is like a great idea and was very exciting.
00:12:57 But it was just okay. It wasn't like my favorite or anything. It was just fine.
00:13:02 There's a, there's a new, there's new monster ultra. There's ultra gold and ultra watermelon.
00:13:10 What does the ultra do? Is it just the ultra? No, the ultra is the, it's the different flavors,
00:13:16 but they're all like zero sugar, like zero calorie. What is there? There's white, there's
00:13:23 ultra white, ultra, ultra black, ultra violet, ultra blue, ultra sunrise, ultra, there's ultra red.
00:13:32 Ultra brown. Now there's ultra, now there's ultra gold and ultra watermelon. Oh, there's ultra rose.
00:13:41 No, Rosa, Rose, whatever. Oh, ultra paradise. Ultra paradise is the one that looks like slime
00:13:50 because it's like super bright green. And I, this blew my fucking mind. I was so sure that
00:13:56 ultra paradise was green apple watermelon flavor. And I remember thinking to myself,
00:14:01 ooh, green apple watermelon, that sounds really good. I can't wait to try that. And then trying it
00:14:06 and thinking, hmm, that's really good. And tastes just like green apple and watermelon.
00:14:11 Everything's, everything's coming up millhouse. And, but I was looking up what the new flavors are.
00:14:18 And apparently ultra, ultra paradise is not green apple watermelon. It is kiwi cucumber
00:14:24 lime flavor. And this is, this has changed everything for me. Nothing will ever be the same.
00:14:33 Maybe, maybe it's all in your head and it's actually just a bunch of sugar and you just think it's
00:14:39 a fruit when it's just sugar. It's just, it's just, it's just the color of the can that tricks me
00:14:46 into thinking they taste different. Yeah. I could believe it. I could believe it.
00:14:54 I don't know. None of the, none of the new flavors blew me away. I was a little disappointed.
00:15:00 There were opportunities there. Wasted opportunities.
00:15:06 It's just, how, they didn't fill the void. The, the, the new, the new monster ultra
00:15:11 colors didn't fill the void inside me. What, what should I do?
00:15:17 From being one year older, you have an extra year's worth of voice to fill. You've been collecting them.
00:15:25 I've been, I've been void gazing. I've been chasing it. Yeah.
00:15:32 I just, I just gotta find something else. Gotta find, gotta find meaning. I can't,
00:15:39 I think, I think I, I've said this before, but I think I've finally hit the point where I have no
00:15:44 more joy. I have no more joy to extract from Noida anymore. I, I'm just, I've got a game going
00:15:52 right now. My wand is amazing. I'm at the last boss and I'm like, well, I could go and collect orbs,
00:15:59 but what's the point? You know, what's the point? I know that feeling right now. It's,
00:16:08 it's in Minesweeper. Even though Minesweeper is like endlessly fun, I'm like, I can just complete
00:16:15 like an evil sized board in no guessing mode. Evil sized. Yeah. And it'd be like clickity,
00:16:21 clickity, clickity, clickity, clickity, clickity, clickity, clickity, clickity, clickity, clickity,
00:16:24 down the track, down the Minesweeper track. And I completed it and I was like, ah, yeah.
00:16:30 Well, I can do that now. It's no longer that much of a challenge. Yeah. Just the times I lose is
00:16:34 usually just when, oh, it's very difficult and, like, I can't do it, and then I lose. Or I just
00:16:42 slip my finger, but if I can, you know, if the, if there's no, like, big guess work,
00:16:48 I'll just go all the way through and I'm like, okay, I've spent so long listening to
00:16:53 YouTube videos and playing this game. I don't care about what I'm doing, but I guess I'll
00:16:59 do another one. Oh, yeah, I guess I'll just do another, I guess I'll just start up a new
00:17:07 Noida because I beat the last one. Okay. I've been playing Dark Souls as well, that sort
00:17:12 of thing where I got the Black Knight Greatsword early on. I was like, oh, I guess I should
00:17:17 do a strength build. And I just played the game with a strength build, one-shotting most
00:17:21 things. It's like, this is so boring. I've played the game like this at least two times
00:17:27 all the way through. And it's not fun. Dark Souls 1 is very slow. The Black Knight Greatsword
00:17:35 is extremely slow. But I know all the enemies, I know all the places, I know everything. I
00:17:41 can just run through it, kill everything, grab everything, kill the bosses. I'm like,
00:17:47 I spent like three, four hours to last, you know, that day just doing that. And I didn't
00:17:52 enjoy myself. I was just on autopilot. I was playing the thing.
00:17:57 Yeah. Yeah.
00:18:01 Why go to be like that?
00:18:03 Where am I going to get? The dopamine well has dried up. We got to find more. We got to
00:18:10 migrate somewhere. We got to be nomads and roam somewhere to find new supplies.
00:18:17 I think it's just because it was so easy to click on. I've been, we wanted to get into more
00:18:24 into Subnautica. And that was pretty cool. Subnautica seems scary.
00:18:32 It is. That's why I liked it. I played it and it's big and scary and wet and it's an ocean,
00:18:40 you know, like a big scary wet ocean. And the day-night cycle causes it. Because it's
00:18:46 you know, an alien planet. There's no artificial light anywhere. As soon as the sun sets,
00:18:52 underwater is like almost completely pitch black. And if your torch or your flashlight, I
00:18:57 should say, that can run out of battery and you have to like collect materials to craft
00:19:03 batteries. So you could be out in the middle of the ocean. The sun could set. Your torch would
00:19:08 be out of juice. And then you'd be right at the deep down and scary. There's big scary monsters
00:19:15 making noises. And it could be anywhere 360 around you because it's, you know, water. It's great.
00:19:21 The idea of a giant like beast looming up out of you, at you out of the depths of the sea is like
00:19:30 one of the scariest things I can even imagine. Oh, dude. There was this one bit
00:19:36 where I, you can only go so far down with your regular like mask, what do you call it? O2?
00:19:47 The thing you breathe, canister, you need like to upgrade it so you can dive deeper and stuff.
00:19:54 So I can go down a certain way. And then I got that upgrade and then I found a cave. And I was
00:19:59 like, oh, let's go down into this cave now that I can. I went really far down and then it opened up
00:20:04 into this gargantuan like underground cavern with very strange, completely new foliage and
00:20:12 flora and fauna and like different fish I'd never seen before. And it was all just this
00:20:17 out of reach. And then there was big scary screaming noises. I was like, ah, no.
00:20:23 Like it was very, very, very dark because the sun can reach down there. So I was like,
00:20:28 I had to throw a flare down and it just kept going down. I was like, no, no, no, no, no.
00:20:32 If this is the next part of the game, I don't want to play anymore. I don't want to go down here.
00:20:37 Yeah. Yeah. Wait, you have a VR?
00:20:42 It's not VR. Maybe it is VR, but I don't have one. You can just play it with a controller.
00:20:46 Oh, I thought Subnautica was a freaking VR game. There's a non-VR version?
00:20:54 I don't know. It definitely is in VR. You can play it that way, which would make it so much
00:20:59 scary. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You have a VR, so you could play that version if it exists. I haven't
00:21:05 seen it. But I won't. But I fucking won't do it. I mean, it's very satisfying overcoming these fears
00:21:15 because when you're first plunked into the ocean, you don't know anything. So anything could be
00:21:20 like, you're thinking, okay, sharks, are they going to come? How am I going to respond to that?
00:21:25 Oh god, I don't know how to play. I don't know how to move. Left, right, up, down. Oh my god,
00:21:30 what the fuck is that? And then you're constantly running out of food and water. You have to find
00:21:38 materials to cook things so that you can live, so that you can disinfect seawater, so you can drink
00:21:44 it. So there's a time thing. You can't just relax. You have to keep going out into the ocean to get
00:21:50 things. It forces you to face the scariness of the unknown until you're comfortable in a certain
00:21:59 area and then you branch out a bit and then you get more materials. You find secret materials,
00:22:03 special materials. You get gold and you can make super computer chips and you can craft vehicles
00:22:08 that can go even further. You make beacons and you can build underwater bases.
00:22:16 Can you build a chainsaw wand, though? I didn't think so.
00:22:25 Noida 1, Subnautica 0.
00:22:28 I don't know about a chainsaw, but you can definitely get a drill at some point to drill
00:22:32 through big veins of iron or it was not iron. I think it's not iron. That's pretty good.
00:22:39 Yeah. Very nice. Impressive.
00:22:47 So are you saying, so is it terrifying or no?
00:22:51 It is terrifying, definitely at first.
00:22:54 I feel like it's not supposed to be like a scary game and yet I feel like just the feeling of being
00:22:59 in that in the sea with the possibility of monsters is just, it's too scary even though it's not
00:23:06 trying to be. I think it is trying to be pretty scary. Because it's the unknown and you can't
00:23:15 see you very far because it's murky and there's these big huge kelp. I don't know. They're not
00:23:22 called kelp because this is an alien planet. Everything has a funny name. There's these
00:23:26 huge forests of kelp and you can swim through them, but obviously they block your vision and then
00:23:31 you hear a weird snarl from some predator and it could be attacking you, but it also could very
00:23:39 easily be attacking some other fish. So you don't know whether a prompt from an audio cue is
00:23:46 something that you should be wary of or something that you could get used to just happening because
00:23:51 some creatures, they just make noises. So you have to get used to all of these things. It is
00:23:57 supposed to be like venture into the unknown and figure it out because you crash landed and
00:24:03 nobody is there to help. You have to get your scanning thing and you craft a scanning thing and
00:24:12 then you can scan items like creatures, but you have to hold the scanner on them. So if I needed
00:24:18 to scan a predator to see what its weaknesses are or whatever, I would have to get in range of one
00:24:25 to scan it for long enough and hold the scan beam on it while it chases me and I was like, no, no,
00:24:31 no thank you. But yeah, you can build up your knowledge database of all the things you've
00:24:40 scanned and things you understand. It's such a satisfying progression of that kind of survival
00:24:47 game. I think you really would enjoy it. Yeah, I could see there's aspects of it that I do think
00:24:55 seem pretty cool. And I think I watched Joseph Anderson review of it. Do you know him? I think
00:25:04 I saw that as well. Yes, I know him. He's the project methematosus lol. He pretty much is,
00:25:13 who actually makes videos, Lamal. But yeah, it seemed cool and I considered playing it for a
00:25:21 little while, but I never got around to it. I think maybe the reason is because my current set
00:25:28 up in my room is like, it's not quite big enough to make VR work. I can use the headset. I can just
00:25:40 barely sort of make it work, but it's a little smaller than is optimal. And I have a problem
00:25:49 with, I set up the sensors and they work and they have enough space, but I can move in ways where
00:25:59 the table will clip between me and the sensor and it'll stop sensing me because the line of
00:26:05 sight is interrupted and stuff. It's just a little bit inconvenient. It doesn't quite work as well as
00:26:10 it should, which is a bummer. I think I watched a video at the Xammon Life of Gaming, talked about
00:26:20 Subnautica in a best of 2018. I think that's why I was so interested in it because he really
00:26:26 sold me on how it works. Xammon Life of Gaming was that channel that Jesse liked or he knew the guy
00:26:32 who made it, right? Jesse knew the guy, yeah, and friends, I assume, they're like forum friends.
00:26:39 I met up before, but yeah. Xammon Life of Gaming was that guy. He was very nerdy looking and
00:26:46 sounding, but he seemed to really like guns and most of his videos were about FPSers.
00:26:53 Yeah, he's a good boy. He would always take special mention of how the guns work in the
00:26:59 game and whether they're accurate and so on, which I thought was pretty funny.
00:27:04 He's got really good content. I have subscribed and it's been good.
00:27:09 I liked his old stuff. Does he still make videos?
00:27:13 Yeah, I have so often. I haven't checked his channel in a long time, but I would.
00:27:24 He went through Marathon, which is a franchise I hadn't heard about.
00:27:27 Yeah, he makes videos about things and I'm like, I never have heard of many of these things,
00:27:35 but I like that he's so into them and he cares about these types of games so much that he can
00:27:41 really praise something done right in a certain way for shooter games and stuff.
00:27:48 His last video was five months ago.
00:27:55 So he makes them occasionally. Oh yeah, I haven't seen any of these.
00:28:03 These are all new since the last time I checked. Awesome.
00:28:09 This is my bread and butter. It's just a YouTube video where a guy talks about a video game.
00:28:18 I have endless appetite for this. I cannot stop watching this genre.
00:28:24 It's just there's an infinite amount of it and I can just put it on
00:28:30 and I can pay attention or not pay attention and that's what I do all day every day.
00:28:34 It's fucked up, honestly.
00:28:38 Truth? I've talked about this. We've talked about this.
00:28:44 Put on a video to ignore, but then sometimes I get distracted by it and I do pay attention
00:28:49 and it does distract me from what I should be doing, even though I didn't want it to.
00:28:53 Did you see the red letter media best of the worst supercut of really memorable moments from
00:29:04 almost a hundred episodes? The hundredth episode is coming out soon, apparently,
00:29:08 of best of the worst. Oh no, I didn't see this. This montage, I guess it came out yesterday?
00:29:15 Yeah. No, I haven't seen it. It was just so... I don't know.
00:29:20 I had seen all of those videos multiple times and to see so many of those moments,
00:29:27 I'm like, oh, that was a great episode. Oh, that was a great episode. Oh,
00:29:30 that was in a great episode. All of these were in so many great episodes of best of the worst.
00:29:36 How many fucking hours of content have I watched of that?
00:29:40 There's a hundred episodes of best of the worst. Soon to be 100 episodes, yes.
00:29:45 That's insane. It doesn't seem like there's a hundred. I would have guessed there were maybe
00:29:50 like 20 or 30. Oh no, wow. Way more than 20. What? What? I just... I don't... I can't believe it.
00:30:04 Also, I can't believe this best of the best of the worst. It's only two minutes long, like...
00:30:10 It's a very short... Only two minutes. They definitely would have cut out the things.
00:30:16 They can't have like... I just feel like there's more than two minutes worth of memorable highlights
00:30:23 from that. It's not like highlights from the show. It's like highlights of movies they've
00:30:28 watched on best of the worst, like little clips, like exploding environments, like a
00:30:32 environment explodes, like that part. And then there's things like that. Remlazar is on there
00:30:37 for like a frame. So it's like... One frame. Yeah, just little bits of all of these things. Like,
00:30:43 how do I remember this? Oh my god, I do. I can get of them. The guy blows up at the end.
00:30:50 I don't even... I don't remember some of these. Like, I don't remember the movies themselves.
00:31:00 This one, it's like really at the beginning, it's like a guy with a beard and a mohawk
00:31:03 getting his head chopped off. I don't remember that at all. I have no clue what movie that was from.
00:31:10 I guess I like don't remember the movies as well as I remember the discussions, because I mean,
00:31:14 a lot of the time I'm not even looking at the screen, right? I'm not like watching it. I'm
00:31:19 listening to it passively. Wait a minute, it says... I guess I forget the Raiders of Atlantis. I forget
00:31:26 that one, yeah. Is that the one with... The mohawk guy's head chopped off? Yeah, Raiders of
00:31:32 Atlantis. No recollection of that whatsoever. Red Letter Media. What a franchise. What an
00:31:42 unlikely story. A bunch of fucking weirdos from Milwaukee. They said they'd never amount to
00:31:50 anything, but they made a couple of shitty movies and then they made a YouTube channel and now look
00:31:56 at them. Have you seen any of their movies, because I actually have not seen Space Copper?
00:32:03 I haven't, no. I've heard they're bad, so I'm like, I'm not that interested. It's a movie,
00:32:09 it's different. What's the one about a gorilla? They had an old movie they made that's something
00:32:15 about a gorilla. I don't know. They made a lot of old movies, like little fun film,
00:32:23 student projects stuff. Space Cop. Hold on. No, Revenge...
00:32:38 Low budget features produced by and starring Stoklasa and the Red Letter Media affiliates
00:32:43 have been largely horror and comedy, such as Feeding Frenzy, The Recovered,
00:32:49 Orange's, Revenge of the Eggplant, and Space Cop. I swear to God, they have one about a gorilla
00:32:56 and there was a... if you like a patron or something, you could get a behind-the-scenes
00:33:02 documentary. Am I having a stroke? I was 100% sure of this, but maybe I'm confused. I don't know.
00:33:14 And I think I wanted to watch it, but it cost money and I said, no. Oh well.
00:33:23 Yeah, I haven't seen Space Cop or any of that. It looks like... I'm sure it's fine.
00:33:32 I'm sure it's fine. I think these guys are funny, but I don't necessarily trust
00:33:38 that they have immaculate filmmaking sense. I've seen a bunch of their old sketch comedies on the
00:33:45 channel. You left? I left to pee. Oh, lol. I didn't hear what you said. Have you ever gone back and
00:33:53 watched their oldest videos in chronological order? No, not all of them. I think I've watched the
00:34:00 making of some of their old films, which were interesting. If you... If you go back and...
00:34:10 I mean, I'll look right now. If you go to their channel and just sort their videos oldest to
00:34:16 newest, you get their fucking fruit pal puppet shorts. Oh, Gorilla Interrupted. Gorilla Interrupted
00:34:27 is the monkey movie. And there's a trailer for it posted nine years ago.
00:34:33 I remember Dale Jackson reporting. I see. I've seen that one.
00:34:38 Like their movie reviews don't even start until... Well, I guess it's the Plinkett reviews. Yeah.
00:34:45 Or like the oldest stuff, the oldest like review content that they have on here. You know? But
00:34:50 yeah, it's all these fucking puppet shorts with fruits. What was up with the fruit? I've never
00:34:55 actually looked at these. They just are like... It's like a satirical sitcom about a sassy black
00:35:05 apple married to a cowardly bitch of an orange man. I think I've seen one of these, the bitch orange,
00:35:15 I remember. Oh, dear. Oh, I'm still... I can't look for a job, sweetheart. I need to spend that
00:35:27 time finishing my ice sculpture. Yeah, that... Wait a minute. All right. I just think it's pretty
00:35:35 funny. So the star was Phantom Menace Plinkett review. Seems to have come out after a Star Trek
00:35:44 review. I never saw that. Is it a Plinkett review? Well, I'm going to click on it. I don't know. I
00:35:53 think these are... I think a lot of these are reposts because like the channel has existed
00:35:58 for 16 years and the oldest videos are only nine years old. So I don't know if these are
00:36:05 necessarily chronological. Yeah. Like I know Mr. Plinkett, I think he existed before the Plinkett
00:36:18 reviews. Yeah, 2012. No, it definitely came out before 2012. Nine years ago. This thing about
00:36:29 the Olsen twins movie, this little skit of him like getting a phone call from the Olsen twins,
00:36:35 Plinkett's in that. And even back then, Rich was playing him in the live action bits.
00:36:48 Yeah, I think there was older stuff on here that has been removed and I don't know what it could
00:36:54 have been. I wonder. Maybe some like internet historians. No, maybe it's a cataloged somewhere.
00:37:05 The shameful history. Oh, yeah. Orange's revenge of the eggplant. So many of their old
00:37:15 projects were about like puppets with fruit. Oh, wait, wait. Stoklasa created his first
00:37:21 video review for Star Trek Generations after watching the film in 2008. Stoklasa believed
00:37:30 his own voice sounded too boring for the review. I remember seeing this in an interview actually.
00:37:35 Are you reading this on Wikipedia? Adopted the persona of Harry S. Plinkett, yeah, Wikipedia.
00:37:43 Thought his voice was too boring. Man. Imagine if every fucking YouTube video essayist.
00:37:52 Because that's basically what it, imagine if every one of them was like, my voice is boring.
00:37:57 I'm gonna like adopt a wacky character. Yeah, it was great. It could be great. It could be great,
00:38:04 but it could be, it could probably get pretty annoying too. Well, sure. But like, I think
00:38:11 it was his like creativity to even think that, oh, I don't want to just be a guy,
00:38:16 a shleby guy talking about a movie because that's a stupid crazy thing to do. That's the worst thing
00:38:23 you can be. So I'll just like play into like the crazy old, shleby, insane nerd thing and be like,
00:38:30 oh, oh, this movie sucks. So I like to fuck my cat, you know, like that's, it was the stereotype
00:38:37 that's playing into. That's the natural progression of ideas. Yeah. Yeah. It's the only, it's the only
00:38:44 way. Everyone knows. It's the only way. Everyone knows red letter media is good. I don't know why
00:38:48 even bothered saying anything. Sure. I just went one time on a lark. I was like,
00:38:55 let me look at their oldest shit. And I was like, what is all this fruit doing here?
00:39:01 Some of us funny though, the orange Apple bits are like funny enough, I suppose. Holy shit.
00:39:08 Space cop trailer nine years ago. When did they make space? What?
00:39:15 I'm looking at nine years. I mean, maybe they were making it nine, but it probably didn't come out for
00:39:23 a while after that because like, I'm sure they made the trailer like well before the movie was done.
00:39:30 What is the 2012 same as all the other things early on in the channel? So it could be a reupload
00:39:36 in fact, you know, I think I was six years ago. I'm so raisey for space cop. That's an old
00:39:42 I think I was thinking of guerrilla interrupted, but I think it's space cop that has like the
00:39:47 making of documentary that you can like buy, I think somehow on their fucking, I don't know,
00:39:54 gum road or some shit on a gum road, please, please and thank you.
00:40:04 Um, yeah, red letter media. Good channel. What more can I say?
00:40:13 God, this is so weird. I'm scrolling. I'm like, haha. Yeah, I remember that. That wasn't that long ago.
00:40:18 Eight years ago, eight years ago, seven years ago. Yeah. Yeah. Best of the worst episode one,
00:40:23 eight years ago, almost 10 years old. No, not almost, but eight years is a long time.
00:40:30 It's so January 2013. It's so unsettling. I mean, you can see in the old old videos,
00:40:38 like they look so much younger, but like even even just over the course of best of the worst,
00:40:43 they look a lot different. Like Mike's hair is going like has recently started to go gray at a
00:40:50 rapidly accelerating rate. Mike looks Mike looks the same as ever, but better. He just like learned
00:40:58 to comb his hair and trim his beard. And now he looks perfect. And he used to look like a fucking
00:41:03 chipmunk. But other than that, he hasn't changed. What did I say? Did I say Mike? Yeah, I meant Jay.
00:41:08 You said you said yeah, yeah. Josh has just gotten Balder. Mike has just gotten fatter and grayer.
00:41:19 Rich, I guess, looks rich, looks pretty much the same. Like when he was when he was like young,
00:41:24 young, like in his twenties, he looked he looked different. But at some point,
00:41:28 he just got kind of like fat and stupid looking. And he has just kind of stayed the same.
00:41:36 Classic, good old reliable, not to be cruel or anything, not to be mean.
00:41:44 Josh looks the same because he has no hair to change. So he's just like a smooth egg
00:41:53 unaffected by the passage of time. Wait, no, I meant Jack. I meant Jack. I'm so. And also
00:41:58 Jack did used to have hair like really early on. He yeah, he had but he looks really funny with
00:42:03 the hair because he's like a ginger. And he but he's like bald, but his hair is like fluffy
00:42:09 on the side. So he looks like a clown.
00:42:13 He had clown hair. I can totally understand why he would why he would trim it. He looks much.
00:42:19 You know, he kind of the old clown look, it has a certain appeal. If he was if he was some sort of
00:42:25 like if he was playing some kind of character, like some kind of wacky scientist for children
00:42:30 or something, I think that would be a perfect look. But if he's not going for that, then probably
00:42:36 shaving it is the right thing to do. Lamal, you know, it's a little bit of bold. Yeah, in general,
00:42:42 I think so. Yeah. God, you know, who looks Josh without his beard? That's a mistake.
00:42:50 He should. Yeah, it's good. He should keep the beard. It's it's much better.
00:42:55 I did wonder about like whether it's like a like more of an objective thing or like a
00:43:01 perceptual thing. If you see someone with a beard more than you see them without a beard,
00:43:07 then obviously it's going to be different when they are without the beard. But can you get used
00:43:12 to it? And is it better? Like, is there a clear judgment able to be made with regards to beer
00:43:18 and hair and stuff? I mean, everyone might have their own opinion. In my opinion, it's not it's
00:43:24 not merely that like I was used to him with the beard, seeing him without it makes me go makes
00:43:30 me feel weird. It's that like beardless, you can just see his face and his his jawline is just is
00:43:39 so like pudgy. And and he's got like a very pronounced shadow anyway, even when he's
00:43:48 shaved the beard. So like just have the fucking beard. And it looks like it looks like deliberate.
00:43:55 I don't know. The with the beard he looks. I don't know. I guess it makes you look
00:44:02 like I guess a little more badass, I guess a little more hardcore in a way, whereas like
00:44:08 beardless his jawline and his chubby cheeks just make him look like a soft
00:44:15 a soft fucking. What's the word? Potato man, puke. Oh, potato man. Did you say potato man?
00:44:26 Yes, I think something like that. The roundness. Yeah, something like that. Yeah,
00:44:32 you get what I'm saying. You got you got to you got to play to your strengths. You got to you
00:44:38 got to do you got to do an assessment, a frank assessment of like, all right, what do I look
00:44:47 like? What are my problem areas? How can I how can I how can I mitigate? How can I mitigate these?
00:44:57 In Josh's case, a beard is is necessary in Jack's case, shave in the head. That's what you got to do.
00:45:04 In Jay's case, it's to, I don't know, change everything, grow the beard a little bit, but
00:45:13 sort of not the way all Jay needed to do was just have his beard be normal. Like the reason
00:45:19 he looked bizarre before was because he did his beard like weird, like he would have like,
00:45:26 he would have like weird like sort of semi mutton chops, or he would have like just like
00:45:31 just the the mustache and it was like, what are you doing? And his hair would be all messy,
00:45:36 but now he's got the nice like comb to the side. He's just got like the nice normal beard on his
00:45:42 like pretty normal face and it just looks good. And he's improved his dress sense to I think he
00:45:47 wears like he wears like, I don't know, like leather jackets now and it just works. It just
00:45:53 works for him. He's still a manlet, but he looks like a manlet who knows what he's doing.
00:46:00 Good for him. Good for him. I'm looking I'm looking through Jay footage.
00:46:05 Well, so this is the the the boy judging corner of the procrastinators
00:46:09 podcast. The boy judge, maybe the past judgment on boys.
00:46:15 Then I don't know about this boy right here.
00:46:19 Which yeah, wait, which you got a particular one? No, no, I was just saying that like this
00:46:24 the boy in general just in general. Yeah, this this boy is this boy is not is not living up to
00:46:32 his boy potential. Is there a way to boy potential and potential like boy potential? No, that doesn't
00:46:41 really work. No, I'm sorry. You fucked up. Fuck. I didn't fuck up. I was experimenting and it
00:46:48 blew up in my face. But you know what? At least I tried. No, no, you shouldn't have.
00:46:56 You shouldn't have done that. No, he's right. He's right. I should have. If you hadn't tried,
00:47:01 you wouldn't have failed. So but let this be a lesson to you.
00:47:07 Yeah, red letter media, movies, boys. It's all it's all good. It's all good. Have we forgotten?
00:47:15 Have we forgotten any boys that need judgment? There Oh, there's that. Well, there's that one
00:47:21 guy who wears like the flannel shirts and he has the mustache and he's bald. And he's like
00:47:27 Tim Tim. He's he's new regular, I think he was there before. But I think lately he's been
00:47:36 around a little bit more often. Yeah. Yeah. He's fine. I don't know, whatever. He looks like how
00:47:43 he looks. I mean, obviously, like a bold, bolding is like difficult to make look good. So it's,
00:47:49 it's like, you know, whatever. His mustache thing is a bit was distinctive, at least. I don't know
00:47:57 where I hate it. It's distinctive at least. And I don't have any strong opinion about it. And I
00:48:00 like him being like a really weak drunk, like he can't take his liquor and he goes like really
00:48:05 slurry really quickly and everyone laughs at him. That's really funny. I guess, was he just
00:48:12 doing that that one time as like a bit? No, I think he really can't hold his liquor very well.
00:48:18 Maybe. I think they all drink about the same amount and he starts going, well, a lot quicker.
00:48:24 I mean, they all drink about the same amount, except, I mean, Mike, Mike seemed to get like
00:48:31 kind of hammered sometimes. Like Mike seemed to be drinking like the heart stuff and like
00:48:39 actually confused. Mike is a real alcoholic. I don't, I think. No, literally, I guess. I
00:48:46 shouldn't say real, like I know anything. I think, I don't, I mean, I don't know. They make fun of him.
00:48:50 They poke fun at his drinking a lot. They make fun of him for getting drunk, which,
00:48:54 which he definitely does. I feel like, and maybe I'm jumping into conclusions here,
00:48:57 I feel like Rich might be like an actual alcoholic. And that's why like a lot of the time,
00:49:01 like the other guys will have a beer, but he will have like something else. I feel like at some
00:49:06 point they were like, Rich, you are actually an, he's like, you know what, I'm actually an alcoholic
00:49:10 and I probably just shouldn't drink. That's, I don't know that for sure. I just, I've noticed,
00:49:16 I've noticed that I never see him with it with a drink. And I think like, there's got to be a
00:49:20 reason for that. They do like mention it at some point. Yeah. Why Rich is having energy drinks or
00:49:27 like water instead of beer. I think. Yeah. And it's because he doesn't want to have alcohol,
00:49:33 which is like, so there must be a, there must be an issue there, which like, if so,
00:49:38 I thought it was a medical thing, but maybe it's just like basic alcohol. I guess it could be like
00:49:43 a medicine interaction. You know what? It could totally be that too. I didn't even think about
00:49:48 that. I just jumped to conclusions. That's a real boy judged right there by Benson.
00:49:56 That guy's probably alcoholic. I mean, it's one explanation, but I guess it's not the only one.
00:50:04 So yeah, shows what I know. Thank you. Thank you for broadening my, my, my mind. Thank you for
00:50:10 expanding me into new ter, unexplored territories of the human condition. Speaking of medicine,
00:50:19 so I'm on the, I'm on the vaccine waiting list now. I think I should, I think I need to go and
00:50:27 redo my application to let them know that I'm a former smoker, because apparently
00:50:34 that is considered a co-morbidity and can get you moved up to the priority list, lol.
00:50:41 Very funny. Well, it is a long thing. So. It is a long thing. I gotta admit, I'm embarrassed to
00:50:47 admit this. This is going to be very cringe, but I am scared to get it.
00:50:55 Where do they stab it? Do they stab it in your shoulder? Cause that's fine. There's plenty of
00:51:00 flesh there. My, my roommate got it in the, yeah, in like the upper arm. Yeah, that's easy.
00:51:05 Cause it's, no, it's, I mean, I don't, I don't even see it. No, no, no, no, that's not what I mean.
00:51:11 I mean, I don't like the shot. I am scared of, of needles and such and like, that's bad, but
00:51:16 it's okay. I can take that. No, I'm, I'm scared of like, I'm scared that it's going to do something.
00:51:23 Oh, it will. It'll, it'll probably make you sick for a bit. That's cause it's like a small,
00:51:28 it's a baby coronavirus in there. Essentially. Something like that. I mean, I've heard people
00:51:34 say that like, I don't know, apparently it's very rare and like there's only, only one brand has
00:51:41 done this and it's not even the kind you can get in a marriage. There was one brand in other
00:51:45 countries that gave some people blood clots and like, I guess. That was bullshit. That was
00:51:52 bullshit. It was like, well, I guess nobody knows for certain, but the tests were done.
00:52:01 The amount of people who got blood clots after getting the vaccine is so low that it could
00:52:07 easily have just been normal instances of having blood clots. Like people were getting very scared
00:52:14 about it. I think it was in Europe, right? It's the AstraZeneca, a vaccine. That's right. That's
00:52:19 the one. It was sort of fear mongered like that because in Europe, a lot of people,
00:52:26 a lot of people in Europe don't trust vaccines for some reason, or at least in France, I've heard.
00:52:32 So it's sort of a political thing to like, not seem like you're trying to push vaccines too
00:52:37 hard because the public won't like that. They won't vote for you or some bullshit. So there's
00:52:41 lots of, oh, we got to ask as many questions as possible. Is this causing blood clots? Like,
00:52:46 if somebody brings that up, a politician in one of these countries can't just dismiss it,
00:52:52 it's kind of like, oh, they have to address these concerns because even though the concerns are
00:52:56 probably bogus, they would look bad if they don't follow it up. And so in the UK, nobody cared
00:53:04 that scientists said, no, there's probably another thing. And we got the vaccine. We kept
00:53:10 getting the vaccine for our people. Then everyone in Europe was like, oh, we're all busy with
00:53:15 bureaucracy and paperwork because we're trying to discern whether this blood clots are actually
00:53:19 like a real threat. And it turns out, really, no, it's so little evidence to suggest that that's
00:53:26 true. And then so many people just waited too long to get their vaccine, lol.
00:53:32 It's not, it's not, it's not rational. It's, it's genuinely just that like, I know that there are
00:53:39 other people that are like, scared and don't want the vaccine. And even though like, it's not,
00:53:45 those aren't even like people who I agree with. But I know that they exist. And my animal instinct
00:53:50 is like, if they're afraid, I should be afraid. You know what I mean? Understandable, yes.
00:53:58 I'm not so, I haven't been, because like, I've been told, they'll call you when you're ready.
00:54:04 So everyone's somewhere on the list. It's not like you have to sign up to get one. They'll just
00:54:09 I had to, I had to sign up. I had to sign up somewhere.
00:54:13 So like, they say they'll call me when it's my turn. And I haven't really thought about it.
00:54:20 And I never really like considered anything potentially going wrong.
00:54:25 I just be like, yeah, now I've got the thing. Eventually I'll have the thing.
00:54:30 It's just, you know, I've heard, I've heard, even though I've heard that like, oh, it makes your
00:54:34 arm hurt. It's like, oh, it makes you feel like it gives you like a mild head cold or something.
00:54:39 And I'm like, even though those don't seem like a big deal, it's still like
00:54:44 scary because it's like, wait, I'm putting something in my body that's
00:54:48 that's fucking with me even a little bit like Jesus. And it's stupid because like,
00:54:53 obviously coronavirus would fuck with me more. But still, but still it's like to
00:54:58 voluntarily like fuck with my body is like, yeah.
00:55:05 But I'm, but I'm kind of like, I think I'm kind of just like scared of like doctors and medicine
00:55:12 in general. This is a thing that I have been like in the last few years. And I never used
00:55:19 to be like this. I think I've become, I've become paranoid, terrified.
00:55:25 It is. It is. I told you it was going to be cringe and then here it is that I'm right again.
00:55:33 Far right. Yeah. Scary. It's scary. I'm so scared. I'm so fucking scared. I'm so fucking scared.
00:55:43 You're going to go to the doctors, the hospital, whatever they're going to say. All right, Ben,
00:55:48 Saint, sit down here. We're going to, we're going to, we're going to throw this needle at you.
00:55:55 You're going to take it. You're going to, we're going to, we're going to, we're going to
00:55:59 tie you to this wheel and spin it. And then we're going to throw syringes at you like a dartboard.
00:56:04 And, and you know, one in five of these syringes has syphilis on them. So you better watch out.
00:56:10 No. Not, not syphilis. I'm so scared to even exist in a human body.
00:56:18 You know what really? Such a terrifying state of affairs. Yeah.
00:56:21 What really does scare me is like medical trash cans, like the bins that they throw,
00:56:30 used needles, things that have been in other people, things that are like not, not disinfected.
00:56:36 They just throw them in like a medical waste bin. I've seen those bins sometimes like just
00:56:41 open top and I'm like, God, if I just put my hand in there, I could have every disease on earth
00:56:45 and I would die instantly. I don't, I don't like the idea that I could potentially fall into that.
00:56:50 And then, oh, the needle with the aids on it got onto my face. And now I have face aids.
00:56:58 That sucks. I really, really unnerve me when I see like a medical waste disposal thing.
00:57:04 Sure. Sure. I mean, true. But I mean, there's so many things that could kill you in so many
00:57:10 different ways. They're all over the place. I mean, you could just walk out your window
00:57:15 and you fall. If you're on the second floor of your house, you have enough fucking potential
00:57:22 energy to kill yourself instantly. You just walk out the window and that's it. You did it.
00:57:26 Oh, there's an electrical socket. Oh, there's enough voltage there. There's enough voltage
00:57:33 there that like, you know, if you fucking stuck two tongs in there, the amps going through your
00:57:38 body would fucking kill you. There's like, there's a potential drop there that's lethal.
00:57:41 Yeah, you just take the toaster and the bus. Dude, have you ever thought about like how in like
00:57:47 thrillers or whatever, there's like the torture scene or like there's a bad guy and he's got a
00:57:52 weapon and he's in your house like, oh, shit, what am I going to do? He's got a weapon in my house.
00:57:57 Nobody needs a weapon. You just like, you just get like, you go to the house like the cupboard
00:58:02 under the sink, you get like, some sort of like, you know, cleaning thing, and then you force it
00:58:08 down someone's throat, you get bleach and you put them like household objects are so dangerous.
00:58:14 Well, I mean, yeah, but you would have to I mean, to do that, you would have to,
00:58:20 he would have to like wrestle me first, he would have to like dis, what's the word, he would have
00:58:27 to like, disable me some or hold me down in a way to kill me with that. Yeah, I mean,
00:58:33 there's kitchen knives and stuff as well. It's just sort of the idea that like a weapon,
00:58:41 like somebody brings a gun, I mean, a gun is long distances, very loud and dangerous and obviously,
00:58:46 but like so many things in your house could kill you right now. So easily if you just fell into
00:58:53 like a strange mindset where you're like, what if I just did this and you idiot die?
00:58:58 Sure. I mean,
00:59:00 that there's a there's a word for that, like the idea that you can see that a train is coming and
00:59:05 you're thinking, hmm, you know, if I did walk off, I would die right then. God, I sure hope I don't
00:59:11 do that. I better sit down, I better clinch my my legs together so that nothing moves.
00:59:17 I think about that all the time. And I think about being hit by a train. I think about having
00:59:21 my head crushed. I think about having my head crushed every day and what it would feel like.
00:59:27 And it's a horrifying thought that I keep having and can't stop myself from having and sometimes
00:59:33 I'm just sitting or I'm lying down alone and I think about it and it's so unpleasant to even
00:59:41 cross my mind the possibility that I like bad and sometimes I like involuntarily like scream a
00:59:45 little bit because I thought about it too hard. This is true. This is true about me. No, I understand.
00:59:53 I feel I feel similar. It's like when you something has like fucked with me that I've seen,
01:00:03 maybe just in a video even. I'm thinking about it now and and and then it like beyond that point,
01:00:09 it's like, it pops into my head randomly and I'm like, oh shit, I should not think of that. And
01:00:14 now I'm thinking of not thinking about it, which causes me to think about it.
01:00:18 I'm having like an anxiety attack. I'm thinking about what it would feel like to have my head
01:00:21 crushed and it's so bad. I hate that I exist in a universe where not only can this happen,
01:00:31 it has happened. It has happened to other people before. How fucked is that?
01:00:35 I wonder what like therapeutic methods there are because I've because
01:00:43 like to like guarantee getting over something like that because I've heard, you know,
01:00:48 you've all heard of like, oh, if you expose yourself to the things you don't like,
01:00:53 you'll realize it's so bad. But it's like getting your head crushed is a little different. How do
01:00:58 you expose yourself? Do you watch like horror movies? Would that make it worse or better? I don't know.
01:01:03 I don't. It would probably just make me think about it more. Yeah. I don't know.
01:01:09 I don't know. What can be done? I don't know if there's any solution to this problem.
01:01:14 Dude, what if COVID cures your ability to get your head crushed?
01:01:19 I read, okay, I read that apparently a large number of people who had COVID develop
01:01:30 like neurological or mental issues afterwards. Wait, large amount? How many?
01:01:40 I think it was something like, oh, God, I'd have to find the article, but I think it was like 40%.
01:01:45 Which, yeah, they develop like- That seems impossible. How could a vaccine do that?
01:01:51 And it does 40% of that. No, no, no, not the vaccine. Not the vaccine that having COVID,
01:01:57 having full-blown COVID, and you develop these. And by neurological or mental,
01:02:03 includes stuff like depression or chronic anxiety or something, right?
01:02:10 Not like brain damage, but some. I mean, some people's brains are damaged by COVID,
01:02:15 but it's other things too. Depression is- But it's like a large percentage more than
01:02:22 other things. More of a percentage, significantly more people who were treated for COVID
01:02:29 would go on to develop issues like that than people who were treated for, say, the flu
01:02:35 or something by a percentage. And this is very bizarre. This is a very bizarre piece of information,
01:02:44 but I had to wonder what if the vaccine does the same thing? What if the vaccine does it too?
01:02:50 What if the vaccine will give me depression or anxiety or something?
01:02:56 That sounds crazy, I know. It seems like if it's something that happens with COVID,
01:03:01 it could happen with the vaccine, because the vaccine would be like a small dose of
01:03:07 the disease to get your body immune system able to recognize it so that you can fight it in the
01:03:12 real world. So it might make you depressed for a bit. I don't think anything would be long-lasting,
01:03:19 from a vaccine. It doesn't seem like it has the power to do anything.
01:03:25 Okay, I don't know. I might embarrass myself by not knowing what I'm talking about, but I don't
01:03:31 think that the vaccine is just a small dose of the virus, because the virus itself does not
01:03:41 create immunity to itself, because you could get COVID and then recontract it and get it again.
01:03:47 It's something else. It's some piece of the genetic material that causes you to create a
01:03:55 certain spike protein. I don't even know what that means. I don't know either, because I haven't
01:04:00 read up on it, but I just understand vaccines to be the purpose of them is to get your body's
01:04:07 immune system. Give it the data. It's like a data download. Here's the cheat codes for when this
01:04:13 enemy you're supposed to roll. This Dark Souls boss enters the body. You roll here. This is the
01:04:19 eye frames, and it's like, okay, thanks. It's basically a little tutorial for your body's
01:04:26 immune system. That's what I think of it as. Now that I've thinking about it like that, it's kind
01:04:31 of cute. It's your body's immune system. It's a little Dark Souls guy, and he's rolling around.
01:04:37 He's like, oh, I died. All right, let me try again. That's you feeling a little bad after
01:04:40 taking the vaccine, but then he gets it, and then the real thing comes, and he can roll.
01:04:44 He can do all the rolls. He can do a soul level one, fists only, attack, and win.
01:04:51 I know that some people who got COVID got what was called long COVID, which was when
01:04:58 you don't actually have COVID anymore, but your immune system over responds to the virus,
01:05:04 and it continues to do its thing even after the virus is gone, and it gives you symptoms
01:05:10 that last for months or a year, where your immune system is just making you sick continually,
01:05:18 which is fucking cringe. I heard some people speculating that could the vaccine,
01:05:26 since it's just about your immune response, could the vaccine trigger a similar thing?
01:05:32 To the best of my knowledge, it seems like the answer is no. I haven't seen any reports of
01:05:37 long COVID being brought on by the vaccine, which is good.
01:05:44 I mean, I don't know. Nevertheless, it's scary because I don't understand.
01:05:49 Sure, sure. I think the important thing to understand is that all of those
01:05:55 potentials are very, very minor. Otherwise, it would be a very big story.
01:06:00 In the grand scheme of things, COVID itself is a much more...
01:06:05 Vaccine, yeah. You want to take the vaccine over getting COVID, so it doesn't really matter
01:06:12 what the potential bad things are. You'll probably take the vaccine on the off chance
01:06:17 that it will save you from COVID, and the side effects of the vaccine are largely lesser and
01:06:25 rarer than the side effects from COVID, which can lead to death, and it's worse.
01:06:30 COVID is the more dangerous danger, it seems. I mean, not that I would even expect to die if
01:06:40 I got COVID. No, yeah, that's even the thing. I guess neither of us know exactly how these
01:06:47 side effects would manifest in a person like us. We don't know whether we have the exact wrong
01:06:54 set of characteristics that would lead to the most rare, terrible of circumstances from the
01:07:01 vaccine, but I don't know. Whatever. Whatever, yeah. I guess I must have been a little,
01:07:13 little kid when I got my other vaccinations, and I wonder if like, did I get mildly sick
01:07:19 from those vaccinations, too? And I just don't remember. Did they cause my autism? Is that where
01:07:25 it came from? Makes you think, makes you wonder, hmm, two things happened. Yeah, I was just a
01:07:31 perfectly normal kid. One must have caused me. Socializing. I walked into the playground,
01:07:37 and I did the finger bang like, I was talking to everyone. I was the king of the castle, got my
01:07:45 flu jab, and I became a social introvert. I was star quarterback. I was star quarterback
01:07:51 before I got vaccinated. Yeah, I took that. I took that and I became a social intro, and
01:07:58 I lost all of my memory of my Chad's days, and everyone also lost their memories because they
01:08:02 also took the vaccine. Nobody remembers when I was a Chad. That was the big, that's big pharma
01:08:10 doing that. Big pharma wants everyone to forget that they can be Chad's. They want them to be
01:08:16 cringe, cringe, autistic consumers. I used to be a Chad, but now I'm a queen. I guess it's better
01:08:22 lol. It's, it's more, I don't know. I'm sure, I'm sure George Soros is happy about that for some reason.
01:08:31 The, I don't know. I don't know, man. I just, everyone I know is getting it. Like, one of my
01:08:38 roommates is, is vaxxed. I think, like, I know a couple of people who are getting vaxxed. They're
01:08:44 all, they're all, they're probably, they're all gonna be fine. It's all gonna be fine. The worst
01:08:49 thing, the worst thing about people getting vaxxed is that we're gonna run out of the ability to
01:08:54 sell, I have COVID shirts. No, our markets. Have we even sold one of those? I am really curious.
01:09:02 We sold a couple. No, we did. We did a few people.
01:09:05 Oh my God. Incredible.
01:09:07 I know. Imagine someone out there, maybe you listener, own that shirt. It's gonna, it's only
01:09:17 gonna, it's gonna age like fine white. It's gonna get funnier and funnier as the years go by.
01:09:22 It's an investment in the future. Honestly, now is the time. If you haven't done it already,
01:09:28 click the link in the, the T-Spring link in the description. Get your own I Have COVID shirt
01:09:32 before it's too late, before your vaxx and you can never again claim to have COVID. You should go
01:09:36 out right now and get COVID just so you can wear that shirt because you'll, this is a chance that
01:09:40 will, that will pass you by and never come back. This is, this is a moment in time and you don't
01:09:45 want to miss it. That's, that's all I'm saying. That's all I'm saying. Oh, fucking boy. Um,
01:09:56 well fuck. Yeah. You want to go to voicemails? I, well, I got one really for voicemail. Oh,
01:10:03 sure. Go on. No, it's not too early, but I got one little thing to say. Um, so, all right, you
01:10:07 might not have anything to say about this, but I was watching Buffy, um, season, season five.
01:10:13 Classic Gib. Yeah. Classic Gib, watching Buffy, enjoying it, but I had noticed something. Um,
01:10:21 in Buffy, it's like, not a kid's show. It's sort of teenage young adults. So there's blood,
01:10:27 there's gore, not extreme gore, but like, you know, 90s gore. Um, the, you know, vampire's blood,
01:10:35 there's quite a few sex scenes. There's a known like explicit nudity, but there is like suggestive,
01:10:42 like, you know, back of, you know, you know, back nudity and stuff like that. So it's like,
01:10:47 gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. There's been, there's been love interest stuff in the show.
01:10:53 And there is a new couple that have is two, two women, two ladies. No fucking way. And they are
01:11:01 together. They are, they are canonically going out with each other. They're girlfriends. What the
01:11:06 fuck? And it's like, ah, cool. You know, television show in the 90s, they had a lesbian couple that
01:11:11 wasn't like a joke and it's cool and it's cute and it's wonderful. And I love it and it's great,
01:11:16 but my mind, my mind is blown. But here's the, my head has been crushed by this information.
01:11:24 But the thing that fucking pisses me off so much is that they will not let these lesbians kiss
01:11:33 on camera or at all. They just really, they will not let them kiss. There is so, it was this one
01:11:41 particular episode where this couple, there was a thing with one of the parents and they were like,
01:11:48 I don't like you doing stuff. Your new friends are a bad influence, you know, stuff like that.
01:11:54 And she's like, the episode was about her. And then her friends, you know, the main cast were
01:11:59 like supportive of her as against her family who are shitty. And it was like, this is when she came
01:12:06 out as a lesbian, you mean? It was more that she came out as like a witch because, you know, allegory.
01:12:13 Oh, sure. But that, yeah, they didn't really talk to the parents about the gayness, but
01:12:21 lesbian is, it's known by everyone else. And there have been like a few like funny jokes
01:12:27 about like people's reactions to like, oh, oh, you've, oh, like girlfriend, oh, like it's,
01:12:35 it's surprising. But nobody like makes fun of it. So that's nice. It's a good show in that regard.
01:12:40 But they just won't let them kiss. They won't let them kiss. Despite the fact, despite the fact
01:12:44 that in this episode, it was the perfect romantic moment. They were dancing together. It was a
01:12:49 slow dance. And it was like, I'm so happy and you're stood up for me and you, my girlfriend are so
01:12:57 wonderful. And they'd hug. They hug on the dance floor. They hug on the dance floor. And it's
01:13:03 so. They hug zone each other. It's so actually cringe inducingly like unsatisfying. Everything
01:13:09 was leading up to a kiss. We hadn't seen a kiss up to that point. And other characters kiss
01:13:15 constantly. Buffy. I was going to ask, do other characters kiss? Yeah. Buffy kisses her boyfriend
01:13:21 so much. She has so much kissing. Nice. And it's like, oh, okay, I see what it this is.
01:13:29 Now, I'm pretty sure, I'm pretty sure it's the show runner, not the show, like creators, but like the
01:13:35 like TV, like saying, no, no, you can't have them kiss. Sorry, you just can't do that.
01:13:41 Like, I'm pretty sure the show runners would have wanted them to be able to. But no, TV says no.
01:13:47 So that's fucking a lot. I mean, I mean, if if they're if they're just dating, like if they're
01:13:53 just straight up fucking dating each other, like I don't why, why not? What's the problem? It was
01:14:01 so confusing. It's because they they've even had like scenes in that. Unless they're trying to keep
01:14:07 if they're trying to keep plausible deniability, I would at least get it. But if they're not doing
01:14:12 that, then why would it be an issue? It's so strange. Like there's innuendo, you know, because
01:14:19 it's like ha ha witches. Like what are the witchy things they're doing together? It's like, ah,
01:14:25 that sex like implied sex, but they haven't confirmed sex. But they did. Okay. In that very
01:14:31 episode I'm talking about, they had a scene where they were snuggling together in bed together,
01:14:37 talking about stuff. Yeah, like really cute and romantic and like, you know,
01:14:41 they're overtly going out. Everyone knows they just lips on lips. I don't know why. Imagine
01:14:49 you're you're you're a Christian soccer mom, and you're flipping through channels on daytime TV,
01:14:57 looking for something that you don't want your kids to see. And you flip, which are you going
01:15:03 to be more upset by? You see the two girls kiss or you see the two girls snuggling in bed together?
01:15:07 I feel like they're equivalent at the very least. I don't know. It's bizarre. It was so it was so
01:15:17 like bizarre is the right word because I felt so like it was one of those like moments that I
01:15:23 don't doesn't happen often with me. But I was it was like, oh, come on, like throw popcorn at the
01:15:29 screen. We like, what the fuck? They couldn't do it. I just had a thought. I just had a thought.
01:15:35 But I don't think it's true. My thought was what if the actresses just didn't want to do it. But
01:15:40 like, no, that's no horseshit actors are fuck actors are perfect actors will kiss whoever you
01:15:45 fucking tell them to kiss. These are pros. There's no way there's no way I doubt it. No, I doubt that.
01:15:51 I guess I could look into it. But they're quite young. They're not I would be shot. I would be
01:15:57 shocked if that was the reason like young hip 90s kid actors doing like, which is which is more
01:16:02 likely which is more likely to not to be against it, though the actresses or the fucking or the
01:16:08 cigar chomping execs at the yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Easy, easy choice. The worst thing ever cringe.
01:16:18 Let them kiss. Let lesbians live.
01:16:25 Let them live. Maybe they I don't know maybe they maybe they will later. I don't know your
01:16:29 significant other than why live exactly. Maybe I mean maybe as they stay on the show for a while
01:16:36 and the audience and they it becomes clear that the audience accepts them maybe they will
01:16:42 be allowed to do that eventually. I don't know. I could I could see it. Well, the thing is they
01:16:46 have been they've been like girlfriends for a while. It like started off as like a weird thing
01:16:51 like the one character used to be used to have a boyfriend. They were like, I actually find that
01:16:57 I like this person more means more to me. It's like, okay, that's been set up. It's been building
01:17:01 up. It's gotten to a point where they had an extremely romantic moment and they didn't do it.
01:17:07 And it's like, if not, then when would the right person the time be? It's like,
01:17:12 there's an episode about one of them.
01:17:18 Yeah, I'm working record about it. But yeah, yeah, you're all torn up inside. Yeah, damn.
01:17:26 Why don't they fuck? Where's their vaginas? Where's the where's the where's the what's the
01:17:33 what was Plink Plinkett say in the in the Force Awakens like there's something missing. Where's
01:17:40 the sacks or whatever. Yeah, I don't think that fuck. I don't think they can't fuck a black guy.
01:17:49 What the fuck? Oh, yeah. Yeah, that is a thing. Like, like, why wouldn't they?
01:17:58 They just didn't. They just didn't they just didn't they just didn't think Finn was an
01:18:03 appropriate male romantic lead for no particular reason. All right, I haven't seen the fucking
01:18:12 Star Wars. I haven't seen any of the new ones. I saw like Force Awakens because it's like, oh,
01:18:18 like a new Star Wars. So I was like as an event. Sure. Sure. I haven't seen the other ones, but
01:18:25 like, yeah, it seems like there's just no romance in those. I'm like, I mean, that's what Plinkett says.
01:18:32 It definitely would have helped. Yeah, I wonder I wonder if there's like a, oh,
01:18:37 I can't have sex in a thing. We just can't have that. I think I don't know. I don't know if it's
01:18:46 a J.J. Abrams thing. Maybe it's like, wait, no, that kind of it can't be a J.J. Abrams thing.
01:18:52 It was like a weird thing with Spock and that black lady in the Star Trek movies.
01:18:58 Oh, I didn't see that, but maybe.
01:19:01 It's like Spock was like getting his bone on with some lady and Kirk is obviously a sex boy.
01:19:10 I don't know. I'm tempted to say that like culture, like I'm tempted to say that like
01:19:17 youth culture these days is like more squeaky clean, no sex, please. But I don't actually
01:19:24 know if that's true. Sometimes I feel like that's true and maybe they just thought it wouldn't play
01:19:30 well with an audience. I don't know. I would say it's definitely the group that are mostly online
01:19:41 of the new generation. I don't know what percentage of the new generation is like
01:19:47 too online like Twitter online. But those that crowd seems to be very squeaky clean,
01:19:55 puritan, weirdos. I don't like it. Yeah. You know, I say that, but I was honestly,
01:20:03 I was kind of like that as a kid. I had sexual thoughts, but I was very much like,
01:20:14 no, I'm not a person who has sex. I'm not like, I'm not like horny or anything like,
01:20:20 like publicly I was very much like, no, no, no, that's not for me. I'm not interested in that
01:20:24 kind of thing. Yeah. Yeah. I guess I can't judge. I guess I really can't judge.
01:20:31 Yeah. It's like, even though now I see it and I'm like, I don't know. I was definitely,
01:20:39 well, I definitely was fucking wanted to look at adult content when I was under the legal age to
01:20:45 do so. I remember this one time when I was very scared of being caught seeing boobies
01:20:56 where I think it was, I didn't want my parents to find, I found an image, right? It was just
01:21:04 like a very tame image. It just happened to be anime. I didn't know what anime was.
01:21:09 Because I typed in boobs into Google and I saw them and I was like,
01:21:13 you know, oh my God. Holy fucking shit. I could just, if I wanted to, I could just
01:21:18 see these things that I heard about. Oh my God. I got this really, really tame anime.
01:21:25 It's like really like covered up, but you know, it's kind of, it's obviously supposed to be sexual,
01:21:31 but it's very covered up anime image. I got the file, I put it on a USB, I took it to school,
01:21:37 and then I printed it out on the school computer so that my parents wouldn't find out.
01:21:43 That's so fucking funny, but I know I am completely, I would have done, no, I fucking print it out.
01:21:51 Not, I didn't take it on my school computer, but I secretly printed out images onto,
01:21:57 on my fucking inkjet printer. It was, it was only because the printer in my house was like,
01:22:04 you know, right next to mom's computer or the family computer at the time, and I knew in the
01:22:11 school, in the art department at school, there was a printer that was like easily accessible
01:22:15 in a computer area that nobody really went to, and I could easily get in there and be like,
01:22:20 yes, nobody will find out. I can do it during lunch, I can do it during, during, during break,
01:22:27 or whatever, and nobody will find me. And it was just such a bad, like not even good image.
01:22:33 I just like, it was just, it was boobs, I googled it and I have it now.
01:22:37 And you found it and you were like, oh my god, I have to save this, otherwise it could slip
01:22:41 through my fingers. I might never, I might never find these again.
01:22:45 It's true, I might never find it. If I type in boobs now, the whole, the whole games changed.
01:22:51 I'll never see those again. The meta game has shifted.
01:22:57 War, but war never changed. Oh wait, no, it wasn't that. It was, you, you would type boobies,
01:23:01 because, and then you would get the bird. Remember that? No. The blue-footed booby?
01:23:08 I mean, I know, I know what the bird is, but I never had that experience.
01:23:13 That was the first, that was the first word I typed in was boobies, which is adorable.
01:23:20 Very funny, funny, funny that you remember. I don't remember what I, what specific, what terms
01:23:25 I was searching for. Who knows, who even knows? It's fine. It's whatever. Late at night,
01:23:34 fucking one in the morning, parents asleep, dial up internet is
01:23:39 pbbang logging on and I'm like, I'm gonna, I'm on a fucking question.
01:23:44 Go to Google.com, type in girl. Sorry, no, go to fucking yahoo.com type in whatever,
01:23:52 because this was a female. Go to ask. Go to ask jeves.com, and ask, where
01:23:58 is the pornography sticker? He directs you, you like, he, he ushers you in his hands like,
01:24:05 Oh, this way, sir.
01:24:06 Follow me, follow me, my lord.
01:24:09 Right, right this way.
01:24:11 Right.
01:24:17 Better, simpler times, better times.
01:24:21 Ask Jeeves.
01:24:23 I can ask Jeeves.
01:24:25 What the fuck?
01:24:26 Before we reinvented racism, we'd solved racism back then,
01:24:30 but then we had to go and re-invent it.
01:24:34 And now, and now there's no more boobs on the internet.
01:24:38 Nah, well gone.
01:24:41 What did you say?
01:24:41 Where is the pornography?
01:24:43 Yes.
01:24:45 Where is the pornography?
01:24:47 Sir.
01:24:50 I shouldn't call, why would I call my manservant sir?
01:24:54 We call him Jeeves.
01:24:56 Where is the pornography, sir?
01:24:57 On askjeeves.com.
01:24:59 Oh.
01:25:01 Oh.
01:25:02 Oh, what happened?
01:25:04 Oh, it's news articles about people getting caught on child pornography.
01:25:11 Yeah, I don't think I want to be on askjeeves anymore.
01:25:14 I'm going to exit out of that.
01:25:16 Bummer, bummer.
01:25:18 Jeeves, why did you send me to this place?
01:25:20 Jeeves, that's not.
01:25:21 What were you thinking?
01:25:24 You're fired, Jeeves.
01:25:25 The first thing that comes to his mind.
01:25:27 You're fucking fired.
01:25:29 You think your pension?
01:25:31 Forget about it.
01:25:32 Nah, you're done.
01:25:34 You're out in your ass.
01:25:35 No more fucking, no benefits for you.
01:25:38 You're going to have to fucking, you're going to beg in the streets.
01:25:42 You're going to say, I was Jeeves once upon a time, but not anymore because you fucked up.
01:25:47 Ah, okay.
01:25:51 That's all well and good.
01:25:53 That's fine.
01:25:54 That's cool.
01:25:56 I'm out of shit.
01:25:58 I don't have anything to say.
01:25:59 You want to go to voicemails or no?
01:26:02 Well, I can, one last thing.
01:26:06 My pee is a strange lime green color.
01:26:12 I was a little worried, but then I looked up.
01:26:15 You know what I bet it is?
01:26:17 Okay, I think I know what it means, but go on.
01:26:21 No, no, no.
01:26:22 Tell me what you think.
01:26:23 I think it's vitamin B, right?
01:26:27 Yeah, you got it.
01:26:29 Yeah, I'm a genius.
01:26:31 I'm a penis.
01:26:33 It's a penis.
01:26:35 I've been having multivitamins for like, you know, food supplements, vitamins, voetamines.
01:26:42 Just get them in me.
01:26:43 Just get them in me.
01:26:44 But I drank one today and I'm like, pee in green.
01:26:47 I guess I have enough.
01:26:48 I don't really need to take that, actually.
01:26:50 Yes, if you.
01:26:51 Which is good.
01:26:52 This means my urinary tract is all functioning and it's doing its job of getting rid of the
01:26:57 excess bullshit.
01:26:58 If you have excess vitamin B, it makes you pee.
01:27:00 I mean, it's not like green green, but it's like neon yellow to almost like a highlighter
01:27:05 yellow, like.
01:27:06 It's like Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club band, John Lennon, yellow, green.
01:27:14 Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club band.
01:27:20 Oh, his suit.
01:27:22 Yeah.
01:27:23 Yeah, I see.
01:27:24 I see.
01:27:25 Yeah, I'm pretty much like a word, yellow, green.
01:27:28 Some people just see it as one or the other and I don't get it.
01:27:31 I mean, honestly, like, I mean, different, different photos of these, it looks different.
01:27:41 Like in some of the more, the more like saturated, like high contrast ones, it looks yellow, but
01:27:46 the less saturated, like group shots of him, it looks green.
01:27:50 I think it's like, I think it's green though.
01:27:53 It's green.
01:27:54 It looks more green when it when it's shot on the yellow background, but on a blue background,
01:27:59 it looks more yellow.
01:28:00 You know, because that's how colors work.
01:28:04 Oh, God, it's so confusing.
01:28:08 Wait, is this is this dress white and gold or black and blue?
01:28:14 This is your eye black and blue.
01:28:17 Yes.
01:28:18 Based.
01:28:19 I'm, I'm, I'm so proud of myself.
01:28:24 I'm so proud of myself for identifying the pee.
01:28:28 No, because I've had, I've had that.
01:28:32 I also was taking multivitamins and was like, why is my pee greenish?
01:28:36 And I looked it up and was like, oh, it's vitamin B.
01:28:38 Okay.
01:28:39 No problem.
01:28:40 No problem.
01:28:41 Too much of that shit.
01:28:43 I took, oh God, that reminds me.
01:28:47 This is so embarrassing.
01:28:49 The other, it was for, for Christmas.
01:28:52 My parents, no, it wasn't for Christmas.
01:28:54 It was for, it was more recent than that, whatever.
01:28:57 I saw my parents not too long ago and they gave me a bottle of gummy vitamins and these
01:29:04 gummy vitamins were incredible.
01:29:07 They were so good.
01:29:09 They were the most delicious gummy vitamins I've ever had.
01:29:13 And in case you're curious, these are, the brand is Welby, W-E-L-B-Y.
01:29:18 Welby adult gummy multivit, they taste incredible.
01:29:23 They taste so good that I couldn't stop myself and I ate like half the jar all at once because
01:29:31 they were like too fucking delicious.
01:29:34 That's the stupidest thing you could have done.
01:29:36 I, you don't understand.
01:29:39 You don't understand how good they taste.
01:29:41 You fool.
01:29:43 Well, it's one, if you like the taste, you should have spread it out over less times
01:29:49 so you could enjoy the taste more.
01:29:51 And also, I don't think you're supposed to take so many vitamins at the same time.
01:29:55 You're not.
01:29:56 You're not.
01:29:57 But as soon as I had done it, I was like, I was like, oh my God, what have I done?
01:30:02 And I started Googling like, how many,
01:30:05 can I overdose on multivitamins?
01:30:07 The general consensus seemed to be that no, the only thing that would be in any multivitamin
01:30:14 that can actually be toxic is iron.
01:30:17 And these don't have iron in them.
01:30:19 So the worst that was going to happen, I mean, they all said, okay, some vitamins are water soluble.
01:30:26 Those, no problem.
01:30:27 You will just pee them out easy.
01:30:29 Some of them are fat soluble.
01:30:31 And those, you might get kind of sick if you take too much of them.
01:30:34 Yeah, you can over-saturate yourself with them and it'll make you sick.
01:30:39 It's not so bad.
01:30:41 Iron, too much iron can actually be poisonous, so that might be a problem.
01:30:45 So I'm like, okay, some of these vitamins, there's no iron, but some of them are fat soluble.
01:30:50 And I was very scared.
01:30:52 And I went and I induced vomiting.
01:30:56 I spent like an hour making myself throw up so that I could get these gummy vitamins out of me.
01:31:02 And I'm like, oh, they were so good.
01:31:04 Why did I do this?
01:31:05 Why did I turn something so good and beautiful into something so horrible to such a nightmare?
01:31:12 Literally, why the fuck did they make them so tasty, though?
01:31:16 They only need to be a little bit sweet so that it doesn't, it isn't bad.
01:31:20 They don't need to be like delicious.
01:31:22 These are, I mean, I appreciate the deliciousness I do, but, you know, it backfired.
01:31:30 It backfired in spectacular fashion.
01:31:33 I'm so stupid.
01:31:35 I don't know.
01:31:36 I just love gummies so much.
01:31:38 And I'm not kidding.
01:31:40 I have had so many different gummies.
01:31:42 These were not just some of the best multivitamin gummies.
01:31:45 They were some of the tastiest gummies I've ever had.
01:31:48 They're shockingly good.
01:31:50 Do you still have the...
01:31:52 I have the bottle.
01:31:54 Yeah, I have the bottle.
01:31:55 Maybe you could reverse engineer why the gummies taste so good from the ingredients.
01:32:00 Dextrose, sucrose, pectin, citric acid, sodium citrate, natural peach flavor, natural orange flavor, natural strawberry flavor, vegetable oil, beta carotene, or purple carrot juice concentrate.
01:32:14 The carrot juice might have something to do with it.
01:32:19 I don't know.
01:32:20 The dextrose and sucrose pretty standard, pretty standard main ingredient for a gummy.
01:32:27 Maybe it's the natural fruit flavoring.
01:32:29 Maybe.
01:32:30 I mean, it was the flavor and also the texture.
01:32:34 They had a perfect gummy texture.
01:32:36 They weren't, they were juicy.
01:32:38 They weren't too chewy.
01:32:40 They weren't rubbery.
01:32:41 I don't know.
01:32:43 It's so hard to describe them.
01:32:45 They were just chewy enough.
01:32:48 There's...
01:32:49 I don't know.
01:32:53 The other...
01:32:54 It was also bad because like I'm trying to do keto and I can't eat half a...
01:32:58 I can't be keto and eat half a bottle of the...
01:33:01 Even if they weren't vitamin, I can't eat that many gummies.
01:33:04 Honestly, I feel bad even.
01:33:06 I'm sort of glad that they're gone because now I'm not eating them anymore.
01:33:10 Because now I'm eating like normal vitamins that are not gummy vitamins that don't have any carbs in them.
01:33:15 Because carbs bad for keto.
01:33:18 So, you know, problem solved.
01:33:20 But I think...
01:33:21 I keep thinking like, damn, I mean, if I'm ever...
01:33:24 If I'm ever wanting to have gummy vitamins in the future, I want these.
01:33:29 I want these well-bees.
01:33:31 These are just shockingly good.
01:33:35 Everyone, I cannot...
01:33:37 I cannot recommend well-bees gummy bites highly enough.
01:33:41 Really, just 10 out of 10 is my review.
01:33:46 Let me know in the comments.
01:33:48 The active vitamin I was having was like a dry pill that you put into a glass of water and then it fizzes up.
01:33:55 It turns a blood red, which is kind of cool.
01:33:58 Does it taste like...
01:34:00 Does it have like a flavor in it?
01:34:02 Yeah, it tastes like cranberry, raspberry a little bit.
01:34:04 Okay.
01:34:05 Quite nice.
01:34:06 I just take a pill.
01:34:08 I think I have like spectrovite when I got from a CVS.
01:34:13 I need a fucking effervescent beverage.
01:34:20 Okay, so that's my fucking story of why I had to puke.
01:34:25 It's so...
01:34:26 Puking is so bad.
01:34:28 And when I do it, when I do it, it like fucks up my face.
01:34:34 Like after puking for a while, I looked at my face and my eyes were bloodshot.
01:34:40 And there were like spots on my skin, like little tiny blood specks on like around my nose and eyes.
01:34:50 Like tiny capillaries had burst.
01:34:53 And I'm like...
01:34:54 Oh no.
01:34:55 And I'm like...
01:34:56 Are you straining that hard?
01:34:58 You know, I didn't feel...
01:35:00 I mean, it was a bit strenuous, but I didn't feel like I was like pushing myself to the breaking point.
01:35:05 And yet I must have been because I was clearly like bursting capillaries in my fucking face.
01:35:10 And I'm looking at this and I'm like...
01:35:12 I look like a nightmare.
01:35:14 I look like...
01:35:15 I look like decrepit and like sickly and like a mutant.
01:35:20 Like I just aged like 30 years just by doing this.
01:35:24 God, no.
01:35:26 I should avoid doing this at all costs in the future.
01:35:30 It was very, very unpleasant to see that.
01:35:35 Yeah, I've been vomiting recently because of the sickness that I'm not quite over.
01:35:40 I'm still like this whole last week I've been like...
01:35:43 Oh, I feel fine today.
01:35:44 Wait, no, I don't know.
01:35:45 I don't.
01:35:46 I'm feeling terrible and fine and sort of bad and fine.
01:35:50 So I think I'm on the mend, so that's good.
01:35:53 Like the vomiting days are...
01:35:57 They're so annoying.
01:36:00 Like it's like a combination of...
01:36:03 I feel like the world is going to crumble around me because I feel so weak that it can't move.
01:36:08 And I know that I need like sustenance in order to live.
01:36:12 And I'm like, am I going to be able to make breakfast today?
01:36:14 I don't know.
01:36:15 Oh, God.
01:36:17 Because I don't know that I'm going to vomit until it's too late and then I'm vomiting.
01:36:22 Because I feel sick and I'm like, I hope it just goes away.
01:36:25 Sometimes it does.
01:36:26 Sometimes it doesn't.
01:36:28 I've never had my fucking eyes bloodshot from puking, though.
01:36:32 That sounds so scary.
01:36:34 This...
01:36:36 Yeah, no.
01:36:39 That is consistent.
01:36:41 Whenever I throw up my eyes get bloodshot.
01:36:44 The burst capillary spots on my face, that was new.
01:36:48 I'd never noticed that before.
01:36:50 Very creepy.
01:36:52 I don't know if that's normal, but I mean...
01:36:55 That's not normal.
01:36:57 Oh, God.
01:36:59 What do you want me to do about it?
01:37:01 I don't understand.
01:37:03 I don't know, Ben. I think you're fucking falling apart.
01:37:05 I think we should...
01:37:07 I don't see...
01:37:09 I don't see why it would put like enormous strain on my face to be doing that.
01:37:16 Like my fucking diaphragm maybe, you know?
01:37:20 Like why my face?
01:37:22 I don't know.
01:37:25 It wasn't...
01:37:27 It was oddly satisfying when I...
01:37:30 I mean, it hurt and it felt bad,
01:37:32 but it was in a way oddly satisfying to, you know,
01:37:36 attempt to throw up and finally get it.
01:37:41 Oh, yeah.
01:37:43 I finally got it.
01:37:44 I think there's definitely a part of the brain that's like,
01:37:46 oh, you successfully expelled the poison from your body.
01:37:50 Good job. Now you feel good, you know?
01:37:52 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:37:54 Which is sort of abstractly enjoyable,
01:37:59 even while the process is like nightmarish and suffering.
01:38:03 Oh, definitely the worst part about vomiting is the...
01:38:07 I'm not literally vomiting yet, but it's getting close.
01:38:11 It's getting closer and I can't do anything about it really.
01:38:14 I just have to sit by the toilet and wait and there it comes.
01:38:18 And then it's gone and then it's like,
01:38:20 oh, it's a great start to the day and I feel full of women vigor
01:38:25 and I can do everything.
01:38:26 I mean, what I did, because I needed to throw up,
01:38:31 what I did was I just drank tons of water, like too much water.
01:38:35 Oh, no.
01:38:36 Like make myself bloated by like drinking like half a gallon
01:38:43 or a gallon just like right there.
01:38:45 And then it's like my stomach's so full it needs to expel
01:38:48 and it like kind of like forces the issue and it made it like,
01:38:52 that was how I, if I was feeling like,
01:38:54 okay, I'm kind of feeling like I'm going to puke,
01:38:56 but I'm not quite there yet.
01:38:57 I would just like chug some water and then it would like get me closer.
01:39:02 This is disgusting.
01:39:03 No, this is the worst podcast ever.
01:39:05 Vomit, vomit talk with Ben and G.
01:39:09 Well, you know, everyone knows how it feels.
01:39:12 Everyone knows how this is a relatable gamer moment for everyone.
01:39:17 We've had shitcast.
01:39:19 We talked about pee.
01:39:21 We talked, in previous episodes, we've talked about shit.
01:39:24 This is the pee episode and the puke episode.
01:39:27 So you can double your money.
01:39:29 The vaccine and some other stuff.
01:39:35 The transphobia.
01:39:37 That was the first thing.
01:39:38 Oh, sure.
01:39:39 Right.
01:39:40 Yeah.
01:39:41 But mostly the gross shit.
01:39:42 All your favorite things.
01:39:47 Cool.
01:39:48 Cool.
01:39:51 Okay.
01:39:52 Well, you want to go voicemail?
01:39:54 Okay.
01:39:55 We actually have a lot.
01:39:57 So let's try and be fast.
01:40:00 Yeah, I know.
01:40:01 Let's try and be fast.
01:40:03 Yeah.
01:40:04 You have to go all the way back to page three.
01:40:07 The first one is called.
01:40:09 I know the first one is called who is Yig even for.
01:40:13 Do you see that one?
01:40:14 Yep.
01:40:15 Okay.
01:40:16 Three, two, one, go.
01:40:19 Hey guys.
01:40:20 So while we're shitting on Yig studios and don't get me wrong,
01:40:23 we definitely should keep this up.
01:40:25 I just got to ask.
01:40:27 Who is it for?
01:40:29 Like what audience are they trying to court?
01:40:32 I legitimately don't understand it because they're always going
01:40:35 on about how much they hate parasocial relationships.
01:40:38 Fuck parasocial relationships.
01:40:40 I don't know you anything.
01:40:42 You don't know who I am, but it feels like their entire
01:40:44 business model is built around it.
01:40:47 Like having meetups and.
01:40:50 Constantly making videos of them just getting high and shit
01:40:53 like anyone cares.
01:40:55 I don't know if I agree with that.
01:40:57 Think that they're friends.
01:40:58 I just legitimately don't understand.
01:41:01 I mean, it's not like you have casual fans because you're not
01:41:04 making anything that's worth watching at all.
01:41:06 And it's not like you're making your old fans happy because
01:41:10 you're constantly shitting on them.
01:41:13 Calling them entitled and not giving them blue rays that they
01:41:16 paid for.
01:41:17 So I just really don't understand what Trixie is trying to do.
01:41:22 You guys can enlighten me.
01:41:24 Let me know.
01:41:25 But I don't think you don't either.
01:41:27 I think you are wrong.
01:41:28 Anyway, PCP forever.
01:41:30 Tom will never die.
01:41:33 Tom will outlast all of us.
01:41:36 I think you are wrong to say that Yig is about like courting
01:41:40 parasocial relationships.
01:41:41 I don't think it is.
01:41:43 The meetups they talk about doing are not with like fan.
01:41:47 They're not fan meetups.
01:41:48 They talk about meeting with like other, you know, people that
01:41:53 make creative.
01:41:54 So people like noise.
01:41:56 Raps.
01:41:57 Yeah.
01:41:58 It's like other other people who make who make raps.
01:42:01 They talk about like meeting up with those people on their bus
01:42:06 tour, which for the record is never happening.
01:42:08 There is no RV.
01:42:09 I think the stuff is that it's it's weird because it's like it's a
01:42:14 Trixie project with music and and I don't know how much of the
01:42:20 direction like obviously Trixie wants to do a lot of this weird
01:42:23 music stuff.
01:42:24 And that's fine.
01:42:25 That's cool.
01:42:26 I guess.
01:42:27 And the anime is fine.
01:42:28 It was fine.
01:42:29 It was fine when it was on when it was on the after dark channel.
01:42:32 Yeah.
01:42:33 The there was a comment or something that somebody was
01:42:37 complaining.
01:42:38 Nobody minded the idea that this this channel that she's had
01:42:41 with 300,000 subscribers who subscribed for a particular type
01:42:45 of content are like they're obviously not going to be happy
01:42:50 with like the majority of the things that is anime analysis
01:42:54 still being made.
01:42:55 But like they're obviously confused and like, oh, OK, what
01:42:59 what the fuck and they're leaving and and Riley was like,
01:43:03 yeah, well, if you don't like it, you can leave.
01:43:06 We're definitely trying to bleed subscribers who don't care
01:43:09 about what we're doing.
01:43:10 Yeah.
01:43:11 And I'm like, if that's the case, why did you want to then why
01:43:14 did you put it on this channel?
01:43:16 Yeah.
01:43:17 Then if you even what what was the point of starting here?
01:43:21 Like it seemed to be working fine.
01:43:23 Like you had the void gazes chases on the after dark thing
01:43:26 that could be the whatever did you know nobody minded nobody
01:43:30 minded when it was on that channel.
01:43:32 It wasn't like because people who were subscribed to that
01:43:35 channel already wanted to see like the side content the other
01:43:39 stuff besides the anime analysis.
01:43:41 That's what that channel was for.
01:43:43 You put it on the main channel and it's like, well, this isn't,
01:43:46 you know, most people are like, this is not what I signed up
01:43:49 for.
01:43:50 I don't know the who the who the intended audience is.
01:43:56 I mean, it's it's a little.
01:43:59 I don't I honestly don't know other than like they're making
01:44:04 stuff that like the stuff they make.
01:44:06 Well, sure.
01:44:07 But like, what does that mean?
01:44:09 I don't I think they're just making it for themselves because
01:44:12 they like it, which on the one hand is like, I guess that's admirable.
01:44:18 If you're not like catering it to anyone, but at the same time,
01:44:22 no, I also don't really know who it's supposed to appeal to other
01:44:27 than maybe if you if you knew these people and by people,
01:44:31 I mean Trixie because nobody knew these other people before.
01:44:33 If you knew them and you're invested in whatever they're doing,
01:44:36 then maybe you're interested in these videos that she's making
01:44:40 with these other people.
01:44:41 And if not, then you're probably not.
01:44:43 I guess that's mostly just like on the off chance that the people
01:44:48 Trixie has as followers also like her music.
01:44:53 That would be that's what they're looking for.
01:44:56 I just want to.
01:44:58 You know, hope they have enough people into interested to like
01:45:02 survive with the money they could get from that.
01:45:05 So yeah, sure.
01:45:07 I just I just.
01:45:11 OK, yeah, it's bizarre.
01:45:15 Next voicemail is called protagonist three, two, one, go.
01:45:20 Who do you think in your opinion is the protagonist
01:45:24 of the PCP me me?
01:45:27 I mean, what sort of question is that?
01:45:29 I don't see anyone else is like more important.
01:45:32 I'm the protagonist of my own story and the PCP is really a thing.
01:45:38 I feel like I feel like.
01:45:42 I mean, I don't know for sure, but I feel like everyone should
01:45:46 feel like they are the protagonist.
01:45:49 I would I would hope that everyone involved.
01:45:54 Sees it sees it sees it as their project sees it as their
01:45:57 project to an extent.
01:45:59 Yeah, yeah.
01:46:00 If it's not me, then it's nobody.
01:46:03 Like like from the outside looking in, maybe if it's a show,
01:46:06 you could you could just you could like ascribe a protagonist
01:46:10 onto the podcast from the outside.
01:46:13 But from the inside, I can't think of anyone other than myself
01:46:16 because that's it.
01:46:18 I don't I see my own perspective way more than anyone else's
01:46:21 because I'm me.
01:46:22 So yeah, I don't know.
01:46:24 Yeah.
01:46:25 I don't know.
01:46:26 I don't know.
01:46:27 Funny question, but I don't know if it really has a great
01:46:30 answer.
01:46:31 Sorry about that.
01:46:33 Next voicemail is called return of a hilarious gimmick.
01:46:37 Three, two, one, go Beatrice more like but yeah.
01:46:45 Yeah.
01:46:47 More like nice.
01:46:50 But I like it didn't it sounded like there was more more like
01:46:55 but.
01:46:57 Okay, cool.
01:46:59 Next one is called sad, but surprisingly sexy boy.
01:47:02 Three, two, one, go.
01:47:07 Holy fuck.
01:47:11 Movies.
01:47:12 People movies are videos where real people are the primary focus
01:47:16 sort of like reality.
01:47:18 I hurt myself.
01:47:20 You know, I do have a sizable chip on my shoulder and I always
01:47:25 have had a chip on my shoulder about the fact that I am not
01:47:29 more widely known on YouTube.
01:47:31 People movies are not more successful.
01:47:34 I'm not, you know, a member of the glorious 100k subscriber
01:47:39 clock.
01:47:40 I allowed myself to be fired from the show so that it could be
01:47:42 allowed.
01:47:43 I might never have 100k subscribers.
01:47:45 I've never even had 10,000 subscribers.
01:47:48 I was also until recently a member of a podcast called
01:47:50 The Procrastin Interest.
01:47:52 I deserve a lot more recognition than I can.
01:47:55 That's not me being arrogant.
01:47:56 I mean, it's just a fact.
01:47:58 I've been doing this for so long and I've been doing it for so
01:48:01 well.
01:48:02 I decided to formally leave the podcast because this would be
01:48:04 insane.
01:48:05 And it's just one of those, you know, random, deep and sad truths
01:48:09 of being an artist that I haven't, you know, hold on like wildfire
01:48:13 and playing other channels and other things have been lucky
01:48:16 enough to do it.
01:48:18 You heard some legal people move video logs.
01:48:24 I...
01:48:28 I don't really get the Jesse, like, a bit.
01:48:34 Okay.
01:48:35 What did it say at the end?
01:48:36 We were in a people movie all along.
01:48:38 Okay.
01:48:39 Sure.
01:48:40 It felt like what was supposed to be happening here is that we
01:48:44 were supposed to be contrasting what Jesse was saying with
01:48:48 what Trixie was saying.
01:48:51 But I don't really see them as like...
01:48:54 I don't see the connection.
01:48:55 I don't see the connection.
01:48:56 Jesse's saying I should be more famous.
01:48:59 Trixie's saying...
01:49:02 I mean, she's saying I'm what, like...
01:49:05 That I was...
01:49:06 Describing what people movies are and saying that she quit
01:49:11 CanTent and the PCP.
01:49:14 Man, maybe I'm missing...
01:49:16 Yeah, I don't know.
01:49:17 Maybe the song is like, oh, like, you could have it all.
01:49:21 Like, oh, the all AK 100,000 subs.
01:49:25 Is it just saying subs go down?
01:49:27 I think we might be just saying that.
01:49:30 I mean, maybe.
01:49:33 I don't know if it's if it's if there's a message here.
01:49:36 I'm afraid it flew over my head.
01:49:38 I apologize.
01:49:40 People at movies.yig.
01:49:43 Next voicemail is called pure Shadden Freud pumping through my veins.
01:49:48 Three, two, one, go.
01:49:51 Here comes Trixie, worse teeth in the game, looking just as
01:49:54 unattractive on the outside as she is on the inside, burning
01:49:57 bridges left and right.
01:49:59 The PCP knows she's untrustworthy and ungrateful.
01:50:02 The dick show things.
01:50:03 Yeah, you're a bunch of drama whore and cowards, which is true.
01:50:06 Not to mention they still think she's a pedophile.
01:50:08 Nate Baseman laying down the ultimatums because he's not
01:50:11 blind and he knows a train wreck when he sees one.
01:50:14 Just to think that this man quit his job and moved to Virginia
01:50:17 just to make content with her.
01:50:19 Bad role, dude, bad role.
01:50:22 Also, what the fuck are movie movies?
01:50:24 Didn't she ditch the Digi branding to make herself more appealing
01:50:27 to advertisers?
01:50:28 If so, excellent job, honey.
01:50:30 You're really killing it.
01:50:32 I only got one last thing to say.
01:50:34 Brush your teeth, bitch.
01:50:37 I mean, I believe she's brushes her teeth now.
01:50:41 I believe that's canon.
01:50:44 Other than that, I agree.
01:50:48 Yeah.
01:50:49 Thanks for the voicemail.
01:50:51 Next one is called, next one is called
01:50:55 Gibbtfo love jelly beaner.
01:50:58 How much do you want to bet?
01:50:59 He will mention the Jews.
01:51:00 Odds on the odds on admission of the Jews.
01:51:03 100%.
01:51:05 100%.
01:51:06 Here we go.
01:51:07 Three, two, one, go.
01:51:09 I don't like Jews.
01:51:11 Oh, you said it.
01:51:14 I said it.
01:51:16 It was you all along.
01:51:19 No, that can't be.
01:51:21 I kind of said that.
01:51:23 Maybe I blacked out for a minute there, but I'm pretty sure.
01:51:26 I'm pretty sure I didn't say that.
01:51:28 I, you know, I think you probably did say it.
01:51:32 Actually, I don't know, but I just think you would and did for sure.
01:51:39 Sorry, but it's true.
01:51:42 You got to look yourself in the mirror.
01:51:43 Take a long, hard look.
01:51:45 Okay.
01:51:47 Next voicemail is called Digi bro.
01:51:50 Three, two, one, go.
01:51:52 Tricksie has spoken.
01:51:54 Digi bro is dead.
01:51:56 Well, not anymore.
01:51:58 Fuckers.
01:51:59 Guess what?
01:52:00 She transitioned to Tricksie and I'm transitioning to Digi bro.
01:52:05 My pronouns are autistic and pedophile.
01:52:09 My gender is human content machine.
01:52:13 I'm going to make anime videos while wearing women's sunglasses
01:52:17 and nobody can stop me.
01:52:20 If you ever want your name back, Tricksie, you're going to have to
01:52:23 liquid Chris style rap battle me for it.
01:52:26 I don't think she wants it back.
01:52:28 More like a golden snitch.
01:52:30 Ha, got him.
01:52:32 I'm a fucking legendary PCP music intro creator.
01:52:36 I'm unstoppable.
01:52:39 Also, if you want a new co-host for content.
01:52:44 I can even pronounce it right.
01:52:47 Content.
01:52:49 Do you say content?
01:52:51 It's canton.
01:52:53 Canton.
01:52:55 You have to say it exactly like that.
01:52:57 I don't think you're going to get liquid Chris style challenge
01:53:03 to a karaoke battle.
01:53:06 I think she's happy to leave the name, but enjoy it, I guess.
01:53:13 Enjoy yourself with it.
01:53:16 The next one is called...
01:53:19 It's a link to a YouTube channel.
01:53:22 The link goes to a channel called DITRH, which appears to be a
01:53:28 Flat Earth Truth video or channel.
01:53:33 Alright, let's give this a listen.
01:53:36 Three, two, one, go.
01:53:38 David Weiss is the greatest Flat Earther of all time.
01:53:43 He's really cool and he goes on lots of podcasts.
01:53:46 He'll give you a Bitcoin if you can prove the Earth is round.
01:53:50 Dude, a whole bit.
01:53:52 But the Earth isn't round. It's flat.
01:53:54 Nobody can prove that it's round.
01:53:56 Because when they never went to space, it's all fake.
01:54:00 And the world is not spinning. It's stationary.
01:54:04 Whereas the Coriolis effect?
01:54:06 Well, you can't prove that it's real because it's bullshit.
01:54:09 I've never seen the Coriolis effect.
01:54:11 The Sun is spinning overhead.
01:54:13 It's spinning around the disk.
01:54:15 And the Moon is also doing that.
01:54:18 And the Sun goes in and out between the tropics and stuff.
01:54:21 I know that.
01:54:23 You can circumnavigate, but you can't go north to south.
01:54:26 Because if you go south, you end up beyond the Ice Wall.
01:54:31 Who knows who's there?
01:54:32 It could just be New Tartaria. Who knows?
01:54:36 All I know is that the Great Pyramid of Chihulu, Chathula,
01:54:40 or whatever you say, is covered in mud.
01:54:42 Why is it covered in mud?
01:54:44 It's covered in 20 feet of mud.
01:54:46 Why is it covered in mud?
01:54:48 Because there's ruins everywhere.
01:54:53 Have you ever heard of the wow lines?
01:54:55 They're called wow lines because they make you go wow.
01:54:58 There's ruins everywhere, man.
01:55:00 There's an ancient civilization.
01:55:02 Rome was a worldwide phenomenon.
01:55:04 They don't want you to know this.
01:55:06 They don't want you to know your history.
01:55:08 The Civil War was a cover.
01:55:10 Like the bit of just being a big conspiracy weirdo
01:55:13 and not thinking Ireland and Scotland are different places.
01:55:17 No, that was a different guy.
01:55:19 That was the same guy.
01:55:21 Was it the same guy?
01:55:23 Maybe it was the same guy.
01:55:25 I wasn't convinced until you told me about the mud
01:55:29 on the Great Pyramid of Chihulu.
01:55:31 Why is it there?
01:55:33 Why is there mud on Chulula?
01:55:35 Maybe there is an ice wall.
01:55:37 Why else would there be mud?
01:55:39 Why can't they ask the question?
01:55:41 Why can't they say where the mud is from?
01:55:43 A simple question should have a simple answer.
01:55:45 Am I right?
01:55:47 And it does.
01:55:49 No curvature, baby.
01:55:51 Well, you know what?
01:55:53 I believe all saw it.
01:55:55 Oh, my God.
01:55:57 We got four more voicemails
01:55:59 while we've been listening to them.
01:56:01 No.
01:56:03 We got our first the page.
01:56:05 Rapid fire.
01:56:07 The next one is called
01:56:09 Hi Ben smiley face.
01:56:11 Did you see that one?
01:56:13 Three, two, one, go.
01:56:15 Hey, Ben.
01:56:17 I heard you weren't
01:56:19 invited to Radcon 5.
01:56:21 So I'm thinking 4.5.
01:56:23 Maybe you can make the next one.
01:56:25 You know, Radcon 6.
01:56:27 We're going to have a
01:56:29 Golden Witch 101.
01:56:31 People have floated this.
01:56:33 Nice lecture.
01:56:35 I miss those.
01:56:37 Those are pretty cool.
01:56:39 People have floated the idea.
01:56:41 I think it has.
01:56:43 I think it's not.
01:56:45 I mean, I don't know.
01:56:47 I mean, I don't know.
01:56:49 There's enough there to talk about, I guess.
01:56:51 But do I actually want to do it?
01:56:53 I don't know.
01:56:55 The next one is called
01:56:57 Gaming 3, 2, 1, go.
01:56:59 Hey guys, it's me.
01:57:01 It's that Mario Kart guy again.
01:57:03 Oh, fuck yeah.
01:57:05 I'm actually playing Mario Kart right now.
01:57:07 I'm listening to the new episode.
01:57:09 I'm in the middle of it.
01:57:11 Incredibly through base.
01:57:13 It's real interesting so far.
01:57:15 It's a little bit of a bummer, but it's also really great.
01:57:17 There's a lot of back and forth.
01:57:19 A lot of different viewpoints.
01:57:21 Ben is right.
01:57:23 There's lots of different viewpoints.
01:57:25 There's Ben, right, and others wrong.
01:57:27 No.
01:57:29 But I found out something crazy about the switch.
01:57:31 And this one's going to be the end of me.
01:57:35 You can actually take it out of the dock.
01:57:37 And it still plays games.
01:57:39 No kidding.
01:57:41 It's like a Game Boy.
01:57:43 But it plays video games.
01:57:45 Dude, this is a game changer.
01:57:47 How did you do that?
01:57:49 Like, literally what the fuck?
01:57:51 What do you mean what the fuck?
01:57:53 What's so confusing about it?
01:57:55 This changes everything.
01:57:57 Bro!
01:57:59 The entire console is the thing.
01:58:01 And then the stand is just a stand.
01:58:03 Console out of the stand?
01:58:07 That's...
01:58:09 I'm sorry, but why aren't more people talking about this?
01:58:13 Why aren't more people talking about this is all I'm saying.
01:58:15 Why is there mud there?
01:58:17 Let me know.
01:58:19 Why is the mud?
01:58:21 Why is there mud on the chinchalula?
01:58:23 Okay, next voicemail is called
01:58:25 Hey Look It's a doigazers.
01:58:27 I gotta say, doigazers needs
01:58:29 to get some fresh material
01:58:31 because it's wearing a little thin.
01:58:33 Like, I get it. They do drugs.
01:58:35 Alright, let's give it a shot.
01:58:37 Three, two, one, go.
01:58:39 Hello, welcome to doigazers.
01:58:41 This is your host, Dee.
01:58:43 And today we're going to be smoking some weed.
01:58:45 And then we're going to be
01:58:47 debunking Ben St.'s claims
01:58:49 that we don't have
01:58:51 an RV using facts and logic.
01:58:53 There's no RV.
01:58:55 Benjamin, I correct to inform you
01:58:57 that we do indeed have an RV.
01:58:59 It is almost...
01:59:01 It's almost done being complete.
01:59:03 We just have to make a few calls
01:59:05 to the Lego Corporation
01:59:07 about some missing pieces.
01:59:09 And then, you know, after that, we're ready to roll.
01:59:11 The numbers just don't add up.
01:59:13 There's simply no way they can afford one.
01:59:15 After that, we're going to release our diss track.
01:59:17 To say nothing of the fact that
01:59:19 living in an RV is difficult
01:59:21 and wouldn't work.
01:59:23 And she's been quite a thorn in the matter of fact.
01:59:25 They wouldn't be able to hack it.
01:59:27 But they can't even get that far.
01:59:29 They simply can't afford it.
01:59:31 So she really needs a diss track made about her.
01:59:33 And Riley will be in it.
01:59:35 My best friend.
01:59:37 And after that, we're going to smoke some more weed.
01:59:39 So stay tuned.
01:59:41 And give me some more money.
01:59:43 You know, I'm making $900 a month.
01:59:45 Right away.
01:59:47 But, you know, that's all getting smoked away.
01:59:49 So...
01:59:51 I need more.
01:59:53 Thank you.
01:59:55 You're welcome.
01:59:57 Patreon thing also.
01:59:59 Side note is almost up to
02:00:01 $8.
02:00:03 Great.
02:00:05 Okay, next voicemail is called
02:00:07 Watch Out 3, 2, 1, Go.
02:00:09 I'm pretty sure Tommy J.
02:00:11 is at large.
02:00:13 I'm pretty sure he's sending in voicemails.
02:00:15 No.
02:00:17 I'm like 100%.
02:00:19 It's impossible.
02:00:21 I'm pretty sure some of these guys are Tommy J.
02:00:23 Putting on a funny voice.
02:00:25 It can't be true.
02:00:27 Oh, no.
02:00:29 You've reached our defenses.
02:00:31 Maybe it's coming up.
02:00:33 Tommy J's. But you know what?
02:00:35 You know what? If he is,
02:00:37 it hasn't been a problem.
02:00:39 Whatever.
02:00:41 Maybe you're right. Maybe this wild
02:00:43 conspiracy theory is true.
02:00:45 We can never truly know.
02:00:47 Okay, the next one.
02:00:49 Watch Out.
02:00:51 Watch Out, the voicemail is called
02:00:53 Tommy J is at large and on the loose.
02:00:55 He's on the lam.
02:00:57 Next voicemail is called

02:01:01 Sclerosis Man, 3, 2, 1, Go.

02:01:29 Ernest for your brother.
02:01:31 Are you going to fuck him?
02:01:33 Ernest for your brother.
02:01:35 Yeah.
02:01:37 That's right.
02:01:41 Okay.
02:01:43 Good. It's fine.
02:01:45 It's not multiple sclerosis.
02:01:47 Just the one sclerosis.
02:01:49 Singular sclerosis.
02:01:51 Okay.
02:01:53 Next voicemail is called
02:01:55 Sclerosis Man, 3, 2, 1, Go.
02:01:57 Sclerosis Man, 3, 2, 1, Go.
02:01:59 Sclerosis Man, 3, 2, 1, Go.
02:02:01 Sclerosis Man, 3, 2, 1, Go.
02:02:03 Hey!
02:02:05 Give and take this track.
02:02:07 Let's get it.
02:02:09 Get it. Hey, give and take.
02:02:11 You're really a fake.
02:02:13 I don't like your hair or your glasses.
02:02:15 You're a snake.
02:02:17 I came to drop rhymes about all your
02:02:19 crimes and all of your projects.
02:02:21 You keep clandestine.
02:02:23 Here's Riley to take you to school.
02:02:25 Yeah.
02:02:27 Get him, Riley. You're my new best friend.
02:02:29 Yeah, golden bitch.
02:02:31 I'm going to get this guy
02:02:33 give and take.
02:02:35 I have a girlfriend.
02:02:37 I'm the fizzier.
02:02:39 Yeah.
02:02:41 Yeah.
02:02:43 Yeah, brother.
02:02:45 Yeah.
02:02:47 Okay.
02:02:49 Give and take. You're a real bad girl.
02:02:51 Every time you speak, it makes me hurl.
02:02:53 Every breath you take, I wish you was your last.
02:02:55 I drove your ass to school,
02:02:57 so pay attention in class.
02:02:59 Riley!
02:03:01 Riley!
02:03:03 Oh, god, I feel so fucking owned right now.
02:03:05 Yeah, get it, Riley.
02:03:07 This was a Doidgazer's original.
02:03:09 Name Ben, you're still not cool.
02:03:11 Holy shit.
02:03:13 You're okay.
02:03:15 Shout out to everyone who gets me money.
02:03:17 I don't owe you anything, though.
02:03:19 Get me more money.
02:03:21 Okay, that was a winner.
02:03:23 That was a real climb.
02:03:25 That was a real high point in the Doidgazer's side.
02:03:27 I really got stabbed through the heart
02:03:29 a couple of times.
02:03:31 Honestly?
02:03:33 Those bars right there.
02:03:35 You know, I'd unsub, but I think I might go back.
02:03:37 If this is the kind of quality
02:03:39 that the channel is dropping, I might have to go and resub.
02:03:41 I'm interested now.
02:03:43 They pulled me back in.
02:03:45 Next...
02:03:47 Next phone.
02:03:49 That's really good.
02:03:51 It's genuinely funny.
02:03:53 Next voicemail is called
02:03:55 the plural word for mice.
02:03:57 Three, two, one, go.
02:03:59 Mouses. Hey, Gib, obviously
02:04:01 the plural to mouse is
02:04:03 meese, like, jaw.
02:04:05 Right, because Goose and Geese.
02:04:07 Right.

02:04:13 Moose and Mese.
02:04:15 Moose and Mese.
02:04:17 Moose and Mese.
02:04:19 Mox.
02:04:21 Mox and Mese.
02:04:23 What about an ox?
02:04:25 What about an oxen? Ox?
02:04:27 Eeks.
02:04:29 Eeks.
02:04:31 I believe you. What about a moose?
02:04:33 What about a cat?
02:04:35 No. No more questions.
02:04:37 No more questions. Only voicemails.
02:04:39 Next voicemail is called
02:04:41 Bees.
02:04:43 Bees in my eyes
02:04:45 and bees everywhere.
02:04:47 Three, two, one, go.
02:04:49 Oh!
02:04:51 Konnichiwa.
02:04:53 Konnichiwa to you as well.
02:04:55 This is Ninja-sama.
02:04:57 Peno-Sento-san.
02:04:59 Resist.
02:05:01 Tretel.
02:05:03 We asked once more
02:05:05 the ninja's just
02:05:07 higher register.
02:05:09 Ninja scroll.
02:05:11 This is the last time
02:05:13 we request
02:05:15 return of the scroll.
02:05:17 Ninja is not civil.
02:05:19 It calls me a racist.
02:05:21 We'll be declared next week
02:05:23 Peno-Sento-san.
02:05:25 Tushio,
02:05:27 the Tokyo Ninja
02:05:29 Chrono. Serious.
02:05:31 Se, Konnichiwa,
02:05:33 to you as well.
02:05:35 Peno-Sento-san.
02:05:37 Peno-Sento-san.
02:05:39 Peno-Sento-san.
02:05:41 Samurai-sama.
02:05:43 Samurai-sama.
02:05:45 My god, no!
02:05:47 Oh god.
02:05:49 Unlikely allies.
02:05:51 Peno-Sento-san.
02:05:53 I never thought I'd miss the old best too.
02:05:57 No.
02:05:59 Sayonara.
02:06:01 That can't be true.
02:06:03 This is so bad. This is so fucked up.
02:06:05 I can't do it. I'm sorry.
02:06:07 I just don't have it in me.
02:06:09 It's going against my nature.
02:06:11 It's my nature to steal
02:06:13 and hoard scrolls.
02:06:15 I'd be living a lie.
02:06:21 I just want to say
02:06:23 it's not cultural appropriation
02:06:25 when I steal samurai
02:06:27 and or ninja scrolls.
02:06:29 It's cultural appreciation.
02:06:31 I love them so much.
02:06:33 It's cultural appreciation
02:06:35 and value when I sell them on.
02:06:37 I love the Japanese people
02:06:39 so much that I will
02:06:41 keep the scrolls
02:06:43 even though a Japanese man
02:06:45 will be killed over it.
02:06:47 That's just the level to which I
02:06:49 appreciate their culture.
02:06:55 I'm so right.
02:06:57 I'm so right. I'm far right.
02:06:59 Fuck the Japanese.
02:07:03 Next voicemail
02:07:05 is called Riley Killed Pizza Party
02:07:11 Man this is bullshit.
02:07:13 Pan pizza suddenly decided
02:07:15 I don't want to do pizza party anymore.
02:07:17 Is that true?
02:07:19 We finally got a man in.
02:07:21 It's all a lie.
02:07:23 Somehow this is Riley's fault.
02:07:25 I fucking know it.
02:07:27 He's got his fingers in every pie.
02:07:29 Just keep making the show.
02:07:31 He's got his fingers in every pizza pie.
02:07:35 Get it? It's a joke.
02:07:36 He's got his fingers in every pizza pie.
02:07:38 Huh? Yeah? Pretty good.
02:07:40 I've got my fingers in every one of your eye holes.
02:07:44 Ow. God.
02:07:46 No, don't crush my skull.
02:07:48 And then I use your head as a bowling ball.
02:07:50 How about that?
02:07:51 No.
02:07:53 I saw Cheezy saying that he had killed the Pizza Party podcast.
02:07:58 I thought it was just an off-handed like Cheezy just likes to say that.
02:08:03 I thought it was just a joke, but I mean, it would make sense if it were true.
02:08:08 They realized we had that they've been compromised by Cheezy.
02:08:12 That the PCP had an in and then they shut the whole thing down to get us off.
02:08:17 I want, it's time to dance in their grave.
02:08:20 It's time to dance in their grave.
02:08:21 We got you got to go to the last episode and comment and say the PCP one.
02:08:25 PCP beat the Pizza Party podcast.
02:08:27 We subverted it from the inside.
02:08:28 We took it down and we didn't survive.
02:08:31 Not a single drop of blood was shed.
02:08:33 We did it all through intrigue and subterfuge.
02:08:36 The gentlemen's right.
02:08:37 Gentlemenly war warfare, psychological warfare with our clown secret agent.
02:08:44 Our psychological guerrilla warfare.
02:08:46 Sewing discord.
02:08:48 Speaking of clowns, I'm behind on.
02:08:51 I'm behind on.
02:08:52 Cycloneos.
02:08:53 Cyclone.
02:08:54 I'm way behind.
02:08:55 I'm like three weeks behind.
02:08:56 Three weeks of shit.
02:08:57 You got to get on that.
02:08:59 I know.
02:09:00 The clown designs.
02:09:01 The clown designs.
02:09:02 There's more of them and they look cool.
02:09:04 Really?
02:09:05 I got spoiled a little, but not too much.
02:09:07 I know that someone dies, but that's not much of a spoiler because it could be anyone.
02:09:12 So.
02:09:13 Yeah.
02:09:14 So it's fine, but I should catch up before I get genuinely spoiled.
02:09:17 Okay.
02:09:18 Next voicemail is called doid gazers finale.
02:09:21 I'll go going out of the high note.
02:09:23 All right.
02:09:24 Three, two, one, go.
02:09:28 Hello and welcome to another episode of doid gazers.
02:09:31 This is your host, the and today we're going to be, of course, smoking some more weed.
02:09:37 As we do.
02:09:38 And then we're going to be talking about the fire disc track that we released against
02:09:43 give and take who is the catalyst to everything genuinely fire in the world.
02:09:49 And then we're going to be talking about how my RV totally exists.
02:09:54 It's not a ban.
02:09:56 I found that out because Riley told me so and, you know, he knows everything.
02:10:02 And then I just wanted everyone to know that the baby's all right.
02:10:06 You know, baby's cool.
02:10:07 I was worried about the baby.
02:10:09 Baby don't want to say nothing, but you know, he's cool.
02:10:16 He's like halfway across the tub and he he's like so scared to get in.
02:10:27 Oh my God.
02:10:29 Sorry.
02:10:30 This is the last door.
02:10:33 Oh my God.
02:10:34 Sorry.
02:10:35 This is the last door.
02:10:36 But Ben, Tom, given like just continue what you're doing, please.
02:10:44 Or just switch to a different like podcast.
02:10:47 If you have to work brand do it because like you're the you're the best.
02:10:52 And I love y'all like you guys.
02:10:55 Thank you.
02:10:56 No.
02:10:57 That's nice.
02:10:59 Oh shit.
02:11:00 I didn't expect that because there was a baby involved.
02:11:02 There was a baby, which means I like I feel sympathy.
02:11:06 I'm ambivalent.
02:11:07 I'm ambivalent about the baby.
02:11:09 But I mean, you know, someone mentioned the idea of a rebrand.
02:11:15 And I don't think it's too stupid an idea.
02:11:18 I think it's so different now.
02:11:20 We may as well, but I just don't know how to do it exactly.
02:11:23 Like what?
02:11:24 Yeah, I agree.
02:11:25 Like, I mean, we did the rebrand with like the graveyard stuff as a bit of a like mini rebrand.
02:11:31 It's true.
02:11:32 The show is so much different than what it used to be.
02:11:34 I don't know.
02:11:35 It's not a crazy idea.
02:11:37 But I have at the same time, I have no clue what we would change it to or what.
02:11:42 We could change like the name of this podcast to not be called a podcast.
02:11:47 It'd be called The Procrestinated Show.
02:11:50 So it was the PCS.
02:11:52 But what?
02:11:54 I like procrastinators.
02:11:56 I don't want to get rid of that.
02:11:57 But I guess, you know, what would be like an appropriate name, do you think?
02:12:06 I mean, wait, why would we start calling it a podcast?
02:12:08 It's still a podcast.
02:12:10 Because the acronym PCP is like the thing people think of.
02:12:13 So if we change that, everything will change.
02:12:15 Even if it's still called a procrastinator something.
02:12:19 I mean, honestly, I would think that if we change the name but kept the abbreviation PCP,
02:12:26 that's probably what I would do because PCP is...
02:12:29 Well, no, because the point of a rebrand is to like, you know,
02:12:34 not associate with what people think of the previous thing, right?
02:12:38 Necessarily.
02:12:40 People have like negative opinions of...
02:12:42 Because I've heard some people think of that PCP show as, oh,
02:12:49 the show that hosted that person who was a pedophile.
02:12:56 And that's the only way they know the PCP through like Dick Masterson area of things.
02:13:01 I'm like, ah, that sucks.
02:13:03 I don't like the fact that some people know that acronym as that.
02:13:08 So rebranding would be to get rid of that association at least.
02:13:13 I mean, I'm not that worried about it.
02:13:16 I guess neither am I, but like, it's something.
02:13:19 Like, if there's a reason to rebrand, I would think that would be changing to something different.
02:13:27 I'm not...
02:13:28 I don't know.
02:13:30 I'm not worried about like, Trixie Stigma exactly.
02:13:36 Like, that doesn't make me worry at all.
02:13:40 But the idea that like the show is different and therefore call it something different,
02:13:46 if only to just distinguish one era from another is like, makes sense to me.
02:13:52 I don't know.
02:13:53 I would have to think more about it.
02:13:55 I would need a strong idea of like, this is what the new show should be called.
02:13:59 You know, I would need something that's like, ah, that's a good idea that would be cool,
02:14:04 but I don't have any ideas like that because I'm stupid.
02:14:07 Maybe we could just have like a formal rebranding.
02:14:11 Like, it's the new arc that keep the PCP like procrastination or whatever,
02:14:16 but it's now like just golden age or something.
02:14:19 Golden age.
02:14:21 We just call it PCP2.
02:14:25 An ironically could work.
02:14:27 Just from now on, it's called the PCP2.
02:14:30 It's just a little sillier.
02:14:32 Whatever that means.
02:14:34 It means whatever you think it means.
02:14:36 You do the homestuck thing, the homestuck symbol thing.
02:14:41 We should rebrand.
02:14:43 We should stop coming on the show.
02:14:45 We should just hire like, we should just hire like ghost podcasters.
02:14:50 We should hire two people to like be on the show instead of us.
02:14:55 I don't know.
02:14:57 Wouldn't that be wacky?
02:14:59 Okay, whatever.
02:15:01 Okay.
02:15:03 Next voicemail is called Pover D.
02:15:08 Three, two, one, go.
02:15:10 Hello, I'm a party cast patron.
02:15:12 I pay like a dollar a month for that show.
02:15:15 I'd like more.
02:15:17 Also would be cool if then you caught up on one piece.
02:15:23 Then maybe you could have some of those dollars.
02:15:26 Some of those cents per month.
02:15:28 Maybe like 10 of them.
02:15:30 I don't know what the split is like.
02:15:32 I have no idea.
02:15:33 That's all.
02:15:34 Just, you know, keep up the good work, boys.
02:15:36 At this point, it's such a meme that I need to kick.
02:15:40 No, I'm just saying we, I should get talking to Nate too.
02:15:44 Because we haven't done a party cast in a while.
02:15:46 Keep, we keep leaving it.
02:15:49 Well, I keep leaving catching up on one piece.
02:15:53 I need, I'm, I'm, I had almost caught up at Radcon four.
02:16:01 And then I like haven't read since then.
02:16:03 So I'm like, I'm a year behind again now.
02:16:06 Yeah, I have a lot to catch up on.
02:16:10 I don't know.
02:16:11 God, I'm always just like, yeah, I should catch up on it.
02:16:15 But like, I can always do it later.
02:16:17 Like it's not, it's not going anywhere.
02:16:19 I don't feel any urgent need to catch up on.
02:16:22 Unless I wanted to be on the, on the POTY cast.
02:16:26 Ultimately, like when one piece ends, you'll be like, oh, well now I should.
02:16:32 Cause, you know, if it, if it does like get to the point where you
02:16:36 haven't read it since that point, that point.
02:16:39 And then it ends.
02:16:40 It's like, well now I got to read all of it.
02:16:42 So it's really just in postponing the inevitable.
02:16:46 Yes.
02:16:47 That's, that's exactly how I feel about it.
02:16:50 But I do think it's cool.
02:16:52 So you just, just should read it.
02:16:56 Maybe after I, cause then, cause then you can like reread it.
02:16:59 You can reread it later.
02:17:02 I haven't even considered that possibility.
02:17:06 As it comes out slowly and then you can blast through it as well.
02:17:10 You can have both experiences.
02:17:12 It'll take a lot of time.
02:17:13 Maybe after I finish my secret project and I have some,
02:17:17 and I feel like I have some more time that I'm willing to spend on frivolous
02:17:22 activities, I will do that then.
02:17:25 Perhaps, perhaps.
02:17:27 Next voicemail is called Researching Flying Submarines voicemail movie.
02:17:33 Three, two, one, go.
02:17:44 We've saved the peg, so it's time to go.
02:17:49 I was at the beach, watching a sunrise.
02:17:55 The orange ocean glow brought a tear to my eye.
02:18:01 Until I saw a plane flying up so high.
02:18:05 There's more planes in the sea than ships in the sky.
02:18:11 We need a billion glad to make submarines fly.
02:18:20 These are so weird.
02:18:22 Yeah.
02:18:23 These are so odd.
02:18:24 I can't really grasp what the vibe is going for.
02:18:27 Like I felt like this one was supposed to be poetic.
02:18:32 I mean, I think they're all, they're all rhyme.
02:18:35 They all rhyme, but like some of them feel like more obviously comedic.
02:18:40 Yeah.
02:18:41 Some of them feel like I don't know whether it's supposed to be comedic or a rap or a poem.
02:18:47 I think they're all mostly supposed to be silly to one degree or another.
02:18:52 This is like, this is like an opera.
02:18:55 This should be, I feel like this should have, there should be like a band camp album that
02:18:59 is just each of these in order.
02:19:02 If you ever wanted to just listen to the whole saga from start to end.
02:19:09 Yeah.
02:19:10 It feels like a piece of a larger thing.
02:19:15 There are like elements that recur like pigs, but in this one, like the pig was only like
02:19:23 in the figure of speech about pigs flying, which I think that was a reference to the
02:19:28 last one.
02:19:29 I think a pig did fly.
02:19:31 I think.
02:19:32 Am I crazy?
02:19:33 Yeah, it did.
02:19:34 Okay.
02:19:35 So it's like obliquely referencing it, but like, I guess nothing really happened in this
02:19:42 one.
02:19:43 He just watched a sunset and contemplated flight, which is, uh, these are, these are,
02:19:52 these are, these are, these are like, these are like nothing I've ever heard before.
02:19:55 I can say that much about them.
02:19:58 Okay.
02:19:59 Next voicemail is called doid gazer's finale part two.
02:20:04 Okay.
02:20:05 Three, two, one, go.
02:20:07 Also, these have all been people movies.
02:20:10 Um, Ben and Nate, you're still not cool.
02:20:13 Thank you.
02:20:14 Give me money.
02:20:15 Of course.
02:20:16 Uh, next one is called part three, I guess.
02:20:19 Three, two, one, go.
02:20:21 Also, that this track was a music movie.
02:20:25 Fuck you.
02:20:27 Yeah.
02:20:28 All right.
02:20:30 Yeah.
02:20:31 Got a hand.
02:20:32 What about a regular movie?
02:20:34 What, what, what about a regular movie?
02:20:36 I don't know.
02:20:37 What about a regular movie?
02:20:39 No.
02:20:40 I guess there are regular, I guess movie movies are movies about movies.
02:20:45 So movies are just movies.
02:20:48 Wow.
02:20:49 Makes sense.
02:20:51 It does.
02:20:52 Unless it's an animated movie and then it's a cartoon movie.
02:20:56 Wait, wouldn't, wouldn't a cartoon movie then be a, a movie about, about cartoons?
02:21:03 But no, a cartoon.
02:21:04 No, be a cartoon about movies.
02:21:07 Oh God.
02:21:10 Jesus.
02:21:13 Uh, next voicemail is called the real best guy ever.
02:21:17 Three, two, one, go.
02:21:19 Yo, it's the real best guy ever here.
02:21:22 Hey, good to hear from you.
02:21:24 You know, Riley best to me cause I'm five eight, but you stand no chance pal.
02:21:30 Bring it on.
02:21:31 I give you a little kiss.
02:21:34 I'm, I'm too scared.
02:21:36 Yeah, trust me, they're stupid.
02:21:40 I'm too scared.
02:21:41 I'm too scared.
02:21:42 I think you would crush my head and I don't want that.
02:21:45 So I'm going to have to, I'm going to have to cowardly refuse with my tail between my
02:21:51 legs.
02:21:52 I'm sorry.
02:21:53 Next voicemail is called for jelly beaner.
02:21:55 Three, two, one, go.
02:21:57 Oh my God, baby.
02:21:59 You want me to fry you up some fucking potato pancakes?
02:22:02 Some latkes?
02:22:03 No, just.
02:22:04 Cool.
02:22:05 It would be the anti-semitic remorse.
02:22:09 Delicious.
02:22:10 I couldn't even hear that.
02:22:12 Next voicemail is very quiet, but whatever.
02:22:14 It was quiet.
02:22:15 It was, he was frying, he was frying up latkes for jelly beaner, but it was offended by the
02:22:22 anti-Semitism.
02:22:23 I think that's, he won't do it because it, whatever.
02:22:29 Yeah.
02:22:30 Next voicemail is called Ben Pilled.
02:22:32 Three, two, one, go.
02:22:34 What is it with you people in the comments going on about bad Ben politics?
02:22:40 What are the bad Ben politics?
02:22:42 I know.
02:22:43 Socialist ideas don't like that.
02:22:45 You're real, not a fan of that.
02:22:48 Imagine.
02:22:49 Is it respecting people's identities?
02:22:52 Don't like that Ben takes the side of trans rights and doesn't, dead name, Trixie?
02:23:00 Honestly, it's us.
02:23:01 What was the bad Ben politics?
02:23:03 I'm out of a loop.
02:23:04 Honestly, it's us that there are a number of people like, I disagree with Ben on politics,
02:23:09 but he's right.
02:23:10 Like, what do you disagree on exactly?
02:23:13 There was a, it was similar.
02:23:14 It's a common sentiment.
02:23:16 It was like, oh, that Ben, he's being based right now by hating Trixie.
02:23:21 A shame about his dumb lefty positions though.
02:23:24 I wish he was stopped being a dumb lefty.
02:23:26 It's like, what?
02:23:27 Okay.
02:23:28 I guess I can see where you're coming from.
02:23:30 Okay.
02:23:31 Okay.
02:23:32 I guess.
02:23:33 Yeah.
02:23:34 Wait, wait, I want to read.
02:23:37 There was, there was a comment.
02:23:39 This is from the Kiwi Farms thread that I saw and I just wait.
02:23:45 I want to find it.
02:23:47 I just, I just, this one, this one really, it really struck me that this guy completely
02:23:52 gets me.
02:23:55 Eleazar.
02:23:57 Cut out this awkward sound.
02:23:59 Oh no, here it is.
02:24:00 Here it is.
02:24:02 Ben, Ben Saint is a literal Jew commie bottom feeder.
02:24:07 Yet he appears like a fucking chad to these people because at least he has a spine and
02:24:11 isn't afraid to tell someone to fuck off.
02:24:14 Literal Jew commie bottom feeder.
02:24:17 Ben Saint.
02:24:18 Absolutely true and, and valid and accurate.
02:24:21 And I thank you.
02:24:22 I feel seen.
02:24:24 LeMau.
02:24:26 Yeah.
02:24:28 Anyway, a fucking vote, vote Bernie fucking losers in the comments.
02:24:33 LeMau.
02:24:34 Bernie 2020, 2024.
02:24:37 2020, 2024.
02:24:38 That's very fun.
02:24:39 2020, 2020.
02:24:40 We want to run on a, we got to run on the fucking the Cor, the Corbin, the Corbin Sanders ticket
02:24:47 for president of the, of the United Nations.
02:24:52 Next voicemail is called ideas man.
02:24:56 Three, two, one, go.
02:25:00 All right, guys.
02:25:03 Hear me out on this one.
02:25:04 What if you made one more episode with a topic now hold on.
02:25:09 I know what you're thinking.
02:25:10 Unthinkable.
02:25:11 But this one's a good one.
02:25:14 Voicemailer rules.
02:25:16 Get it done.
02:25:17 Come on.
02:25:18 Just one topic episode.
02:25:19 Come on.
02:25:20 You can do it.
02:25:21 I believe in you.
02:25:22 I feel like we have been over the voicemail rules.
02:25:25 We have talked, we have talked many times about what makes a good voicemail.
02:25:30 It's, it's only, it's only when it comes up that a voicemail sucks so bad and we say,
02:25:34 ah, this sucks.
02:25:35 And sometimes we give a reason why, but a lot of the time we just say stupid, lol.
02:25:38 And move on.
02:25:39 So I don't know.
02:25:40 Maybe there's a topic in there.
02:25:42 I don't know if there's a full episode.
02:25:44 I don't, I don't know if there's a whole episode.
02:25:46 Maybe part of an episode.
02:25:47 I mean, we've, it's, I don't want, I don't, I don't want to get into it now.
02:25:53 I, I, I guess.
02:25:56 Hmm.
02:25:57 I think a reason like a topic episode would be more difficult now is because there's only
02:26:03 two of us, maybe three of us.
02:26:05 Yes.
02:26:06 Like in the day when there's a single topic and six of us or seven of us were on an episode.
02:26:11 Sure.
02:26:12 Everybody would have one thing to say in a half long episode.
02:26:15 Yeah.
02:26:16 Yeah.
02:26:17 And it would fill out the episode if people just had their one thing to say about that
02:26:20 one topic.
02:26:21 One topic between you and me wouldn't last nearly as long.
02:26:25 No.
02:26:26 No, I don't think so.
02:26:27 No, I agree.
02:26:28 That's totally true.
02:26:31 Next voicemail is called inexplicable.
02:26:34 Three, two, one.
02:26:36 Go.
02:26:37 So do you guys know about the pool multiple and the stop to flow model?
02:26:42 So the pool multiple or P, U, E, L multiple.
02:26:46 It is a formula and the output of that formula, whenever it gets to a range of above like
02:26:55 four, Bitcoin tends to reach its peak.
02:26:59 Whenever the pool multiple reaches something like 0.5, that's when Bitcoin reaches its
02:27:06 lows.
02:27:07 So this pool multiple, it seems that it hasn't reached eight yet.
02:27:11 So that means that Bitcoin still has a lot more to go before it reaches its peak.
02:27:16 And the pool multiple has been pretty accurate so far.
02:27:19 There's also another thing called the stock to flow model.
02:27:23 It's just a price prediction for the, for Bitcoin until the end of time.
02:27:27 And it's been pretty accurate.
02:27:30 And Bitcoin also has a four year cycle, right?
02:27:33 Every four years it reaches a new peak.
02:27:35 And so if you add four years to the last peak, the next peak should be around like, I don't
02:27:43 know, February of 2022.
02:27:45 And I think the price is going to reach something like 100,000.
02:27:49 So that's my prediction.
02:27:51 $100,000 Bitcoin, February 2022.
02:27:55 Yeah.
02:27:56 Peace.
02:27:57 I have not heard of those things, but it's interesting.
02:28:02 I mean, I, huh, I have heard that there was an idea that you could out like guess where
02:28:09 it's going with an algorithm, but I have heard that maybe there's something to that.
02:28:15 I have heard that there are models like this.
02:28:18 I haven't really looked, I probably should have looked into them before I got into it.
02:28:22 I made me Bitcoin investments, but I didn't.
02:28:27 Maybe I will.
02:28:29 And then once I understand them better, I will maybe consider, if I were to read these
02:28:35 and it was like, okay, the math is rock solid.
02:28:38 Bitcoin is like very likely to continue to grow for the next year or so.
02:28:44 Then I think I would be like, well, I might as well trust the math.
02:28:50 I would, I would consider it a stock to flow model, well multiple.
02:28:56 And then you also mentioned a four year cycle.
02:28:58 Do they do all three of these things like agree with each other in terms of their predictions?
02:29:04 I mean, hopefully.
02:29:06 Interesting.
02:29:08 Good thinking.
02:29:11 Next voicemail is called a thing not shit on enough.
02:29:15 Three, two, one, go.
02:29:17 A thing not talked about enough with all this is why the hell did B decide to become a touring artist
02:29:23 during the pandemic?
02:29:25 Who the hell thought that was a good idea?
02:29:28 That is true.
02:29:30 Yeah.
02:29:31 I feel like she's been very lax on believing COVID is that big of a deal, but I don't know
02:29:37 exactly whether she's had a statement about that.
02:29:40 I just get a feeling she doesn't think that is that.
02:29:43 Well, she was scary.
02:29:44 Well, she was on.
02:29:46 She was on the Bill Gates did COVID thing for a while.
02:29:51 Yeah, that was strange.
02:29:53 Very bad.
02:29:55 Stupid.
02:29:56 It's one of those like, I can't tell if you're joking, but you see.
02:29:59 She wasn't, she wasn't joking.
02:30:01 Yeah.
02:30:03 And which, but I don't know how you could do that.
02:30:08 And also think she, I haven't heard her say like.
02:30:13 COVID is not a big deal, but she doesn't act as though she thinks it's a big deal.
02:30:18 Case in point that she's going on supposedly going on tour, which again.
02:30:23 I mean, she was doing road trips.
02:30:25 There is no.
02:30:26 Like with the Yig gang, she's been driving around.
02:30:30 It's like, I don't know.
02:30:32 I feel like before that, maybe she was a little more reserved.
02:30:35 Maybe they've sort of convinced her that it's fun.
02:30:38 You should really get out in the world.
02:30:41 And it's like, cool.
02:30:43 Maybe.
02:30:44 Cool.
02:30:46 Who knows?
02:30:48 Who knows?
02:30:49 I mean, I mean, get vexed first.
02:30:51 Get fucking vexed.
02:30:53 It's not going to.
02:30:54 I'm expecting to be vexed probably within like maybe a month or so.
02:30:59 I don't know.
02:31:00 I don't actually know, but you know, other people I know are getting it.
02:31:03 So it seems like it's, it's, it's basically, we're basically there.
02:31:07 Yeah.
02:31:09 Yeah.
02:31:10 No, I agree, voicemailer.
02:31:13 Next voicemailer is called Sorry If This Is Too Serious.
02:31:17 Three, two, one, go.
02:31:19 Yig Studio is comprised of violent and shady people.
02:31:22 Yes.
02:31:23 Riley is a compulsive, manipulative, sociopathic opportunist who abuses drugs.
02:31:26 Probably.
02:31:27 She is an emotionally vulnerable person that's slowly retracted from a friend group
02:31:30 after attachment issues with a romantic partner and after breaking up.
02:31:33 Yes.
02:31:34 Some distance from their former support group of friends in the middle of an identity crisis.
02:31:38 Riley has convinced Trixie to overtake her once popular channel with his group.
02:31:42 To leech what money Trixie had, convincing her to let the Yig crew attempt to invade every other content creator group Trixie was a part on.
02:31:48 To attract attention for financing their awful and sustainable lifestyle.
02:31:52 When Trixie splits with Yig Studio, because her online identity has crumbled into irreparable ruin,
02:31:57 financially useless, Trixie will have nobody.
02:32:00 I'm afraid if nobody can help her.
02:32:03 She's got, she's got well off parents.
02:32:06 People are too worried.
02:32:07 She'll, she's fine.
02:32:08 Yeah, I don't know.
02:32:09 She'll be fine.
02:32:10 Even if her, even if her, even if her internet income became zero, she wouldn't die.
02:32:15 Like, I, I, I see this a lot.
02:32:18 I don't know how much of like, if there's a, like a blame for this.
02:32:24 Is it, oh Riley's a super manipulator or is it Trixie making the gross decisions ever?
02:32:29 I think it's both.
02:32:30 I, I don't think you can say that Riley is completely like, like being, I don't know.
02:32:36 I don't know.
02:32:37 Swept up by Riley to a point where she's completely vulnerable.
02:32:42 Maybe she, I don't know.
02:32:43 I think that Riley, I don't know enough, but I feel like it's the same.
02:32:46 Yeah.
02:32:47 I think that Riley is an opportunist who is encouraging this because it is to his benefit.
02:32:53 But I also feel like Trixie is probably to some extent also encouraging him.
02:33:00 She's encouraging, she encouraged the whole thing of it.
02:33:03 Maybe like, she allowed him and them into her life in the first place.
02:33:08 Now, I mean, Trixie, she, I mean, she wants this.
02:33:11 Like she wants this all to be happening.
02:33:13 She is enthusiastically going along with it.
02:33:16 So, you know, I don't like, I feel bad like saying this stuff like I know anything about
02:33:25 what's going on in their heads.
02:33:27 So from an outside perspective, this, this voicemail is like, yeah, I can see that.
02:33:32 It's just about as, as valid as anything I could imagine.
02:33:37 It's, we cannot agree that it's not, doesn't look good.
02:33:41 Doesn't look good.
02:33:42 Yeah.
02:33:43 This is, this is similar, this voicemail is similar to my take on the situation.
02:33:47 Similar read to my own.
02:33:50 With a few, a few little nitpicks.
02:33:54 And next voicemail is called Razzmatazz Bean.
02:33:57 Bring back the PCP cock discussion arc.
02:34:00 Three, two, one, go.
02:34:08 Holy shit.
02:34:09 Oh boy.
02:34:11 I sure do wish the PCP would stop talking about foreskin for every episode.
02:34:16 Said the listeners.
02:34:19 And then a finger on the monkey's paw curl.
02:34:24 This is, this was it.
02:34:27 This was, this was when we entered the dark timeline.
02:34:30 We stopped talking.
02:34:31 I like that.
02:34:32 That's an arc.
02:34:33 That's an arc of the show where foreskin just kept coming up.
02:34:36 It was.
02:34:37 It kind of was an era.
02:34:39 Yeah.
02:34:40 It's, it's in the, it's in the, it's in the, the, the early late stage, whatever.
02:34:47 There should be a timeline made of all the stupid PCP arcs.
02:34:52 Oh yeah.
02:34:53 Yeah.
02:34:54 With like over overlapping like, like lions that denote like when a thing was happening.
02:34:59 They all like kind of overlap with each other.
02:35:01 You know what I mean?
02:35:02 Yeah.
02:35:03 There's like times when.
02:35:04 Along the timeline.
02:35:05 Yeah.
02:35:06 Like, like, oh, Final Fantasy 7 came out and then like seven episodes were about that.
02:35:11 Yeah, true.
02:35:13 Pokemon was a thing for years.
02:35:17 I guess it was, it wasn't like every episode though, but there was constant.
02:35:21 It just kept coming up.
02:35:22 Like every other episode.
02:35:23 It just kept coming up and kept coming up.
02:35:27 Next one is called Guerrilla Sausage.
02:35:30 Three, two, one, go.
02:35:33 Yix Studios is super fucking gay.
02:35:37 And so is Ben St.
02:35:39 But at least he's cool.
02:35:41 Also, isn't eating Guerrilla meat basically just the stones throw away from cannibalism
02:35:46 or am I just like.
02:35:47 That's what I, that's why I feel like it's gross.
02:35:51 When I learned that like, oh yeah, people hunt Guerrillas for bush meat.
02:35:55 I was like, God, imagine eating a Guerrilla.
02:35:58 I would feel really fucked up about it.
02:36:04 I mean, yikes.
02:36:06 It's like you get a hand and it's a human hand looking thing, but it's a Guerrilla.
02:36:11 I mean, if the only thing we should be hunting Guerrillas for is for monkeys paws for their
02:36:16 fingers to curl when we make ill advised wishes about foreskin.
02:36:21 Next voicemail is called Sad but surprisingly enticing boy.
02:36:26 Three, two, one, go.
02:36:29 Hey Ben, I was watching your old lectures again.
02:36:32 You know how it is needed some background noise when Jack hammering my cock to incest head high.
02:36:37 Absolutely.
02:36:38 And I noticed something.
02:36:39 I couldn't help but ask myself whoever allowed you to exist on this astral plane without a beard.
02:36:44 Don't get me wrong.
02:36:45 Today, you're a pretty boy.
02:36:47 Wouldn't say no to messing with that chocolate starfish, but back then you looked like one
02:36:51 of those dudes that import dirt poor Thai women to date on reality TV shows and bragged to
02:36:55 them about their 2009 Subaru.
02:36:57 Anyways, say I love her and stop talking about Drixie all the time.
02:37:01 Don't burn all the bridges.
02:37:03 Save up that spy for the eventual RV fallout.
02:37:06 Puts me kisses.
02:37:08 That's a fair point.
02:37:09 No, what I said about Josh and how he needs to have a beard is like true not to the same
02:37:15 extent, but it's also true of me.
02:37:17 I looked just much better with a beard, which I'm growing it out again now.
02:37:21 It's coming along.
02:37:22 It's coming along.
02:37:24 Yeah.
02:37:26 Next voicemail is called Hi Ben.
02:37:28 Three, two, one, go.
02:37:30 Hey, so a couple quick questions about Nate.
02:37:36 So his content can't shit.
02:37:40 Is that why he left the podcast and is not coming on?
02:37:45 He's focusing on that.
02:37:47 But also aware of the league and their shenanigans.
02:37:51 He is aware of the league.
02:37:53 He knows of them.
02:37:55 Yes.
02:37:56 Oh, did he talk to him about it?
02:37:58 He meant he was sort of jokingly mentioned it.
02:38:01 Yeah.
02:38:03 He's aware.
02:38:05 But I, I can't, I can't comment any further.
02:38:09 I don't know.
02:38:11 We didn't like talk about it at length or anything.
02:38:14 He's just, he's just frozen with fear about the idea.
02:38:18 He's got a chastity like shorts, shorts.
02:38:21 There's no, there's no reason why Nate could, why can't tent would keep Nate from being
02:38:27 on the PCP.
02:38:28 I've said, he just doesn't want to come on for whatever reason.
02:38:31 He just doesn't feel like it.
02:38:33 And that's, that's literally it.
02:38:35 That's all there is to it.
02:38:37 Yep.
02:38:38 Next, next voicemail is called fuck Trixie three, two, one go.
02:38:44 Also, fuck Trixie.
02:38:47 Trixie's a shit.
02:38:48 Yeah, I agree.
02:38:49 Has never made good content.
02:38:51 Didn't involve other PCP members such as Nate and Tom because they're great.
02:38:59 They think that Ben may have done something with Trixie at some point and that may have
02:39:03 been good.
02:39:04 I don't know.
02:39:05 I have to disagree.
02:39:06 A few of her videos in the past were genuinely interesting and informative.
02:39:12 That one about main six's ages.
02:39:16 That one and that one retrospective on the career of the your name guy.
02:39:20 I really liked that one.
02:39:22 So I wouldn't go quite, I wouldn't go quite that far.
02:39:25 So there's a lot of good anime stuff that is now gone.
02:39:28 Yeah, all based.
02:39:32 Next voicemail is called slowly three, two, one go.
02:39:37 Hey, so about like Trixie and again and all that isn't like separating people from their
02:39:47 other relationships and being like, oh, it's us or them isn't that kind of isolation sort
02:39:54 of classic abuse tactic?
02:39:56 Should we be worried at all?
02:40:00 It is.
02:40:01 Yes, it is potentially worried.
02:40:04 I feel like I couldn't do anything from over here.
02:40:09 Some people have speculated that what's going on over there is like really dark and I don't
02:40:17 feel like there's any like strong evidence for that.
02:40:20 No, I've looked for it.
02:40:22 It can't really be ruled out as a possibility.
02:40:25 I haven't seen anything that's like isolating from like clips of like Riley shouting at
02:40:32 Digi on live stream.
02:40:34 So telling you shut the fuck up.
02:40:36 I don't know if that's like indicative of anything other than Riley just being a loud
02:40:41 mouth.
02:40:42 It's hard to say.
02:40:43 It's hard to say.
02:40:45 I would say it isolating from other social groups is an abuse tactic, but it's just it's
02:40:54 just hard to say like to what what is the intent here?
02:40:59 Like who is who is doing this to who?
02:41:03 I don't think it's that much of a stretch to think this Trixie just is self isolating
02:41:09 from other groups because she likes this new one better for whatever reason.
02:41:17 So yeah, who knows.
02:41:21 Next voicemail is called what a tragedy.
02:41:24 Three, two, one, go.
02:41:27 The real tragedy of this whole scenario is that the alias Digi bro was just so phonetically
02:41:31 satisfying to say and the only people who would really say it nowadays are those who
02:41:35 are out of the loop or intentionally trying to misgender her.
02:41:38 And as neither of those people, what am I supposed to do?
02:41:40 Just sit in the corner of my room with Digi bro to myself in repetition until I meet my
02:41:45 daily quota, hoping that someone else takes the name for themselves.
02:41:50 I'm well that other guy took the name.
02:41:53 So you can call him that now.
02:41:57 You problem solved easy.
02:42:00 It's kind of a little shame that it's like it is a shame.
02:42:04 It was a good name.
02:42:05 It sounded good.
02:42:06 Yeah, I agree.
02:42:08 Next voicemail is called Jebediah goes international three, two, one, go.
02:42:15 Hello, this is me, Jebediah Pritikson.
02:42:20 I don't really know what to ask today.
02:42:25 Because did you hear about this news about fucking pooping?
02:42:33 You know.
02:42:35 We're having up to 100,000 troops on the border of Ukraine.
02:42:40 I can't say that I did.
02:42:43 Sir.
02:42:44 Sir.
02:42:45 Give me your education.
02:42:50 Shut up.
02:42:53 Bye.
02:42:54 Fuck you.
02:42:55 I like the sort of like aesthetic of Jebediah Pritikson just sort of slumber like slumbering
02:43:02 and lumbering into like a voice call.
02:43:05 He's like not prepared for it.
02:43:06 She's like, oh, hey guys, like he walked into a room and just saw us.
02:43:11 He knows what he's doing.
02:43:12 He knows exactly what he's doing.
02:43:15 Next voicemail is called Jebediah can't find the them three, two, one, go.
02:43:22 Oh, so I gotta say I don't know how to find the leak.
02:43:28 I guess.
02:43:29 What?
02:43:30 And I'm not as gay as them, so.
02:43:35 No, please.
02:43:36 How to find the leak?
02:43:39 What?
02:43:40 Do you know what he's saying?
02:43:43 Let me do it again.
02:43:47 We got a hurry, by the way.
02:43:49 We're at like, we've only got 10 minutes before we hit the three hour cap.
02:43:52 Oh, fuck.
02:43:53 That was our asses not to go over.
02:43:54 Oh, shit.
02:43:55 Is this the last page?
02:43:56 All right.
02:43:57 Keep going.
02:43:58 Yeah, we're on the last page.
02:43:59 Next one is called a shambling zombies.
02:44:00 Last coherent words to this world.
02:44:02 Three, two, one, go.
02:44:04 I've heard that one before.
02:44:11 Yeah.
02:44:12 Oh, there we go.
02:44:19 There we go.
02:44:28 Okay, got it, got it.
02:44:44 Next one is called canned tent.
02:44:46 Three, two, one, go.
02:44:48 Hey, everybody, and welcome to this week's episode of canned tent.
02:44:52 And that's going to do for this week's episode of canned tent.
02:44:57 Thanks for the voicemail.
02:44:58 Next one is called.
02:44:59 You didn't even on can it.
02:45:01 Next one is called give diss track emotional warning bad word piss.
02:45:06 Three, two, one, go.
02:45:09 So on the last episode, you said that give should have a diss track done against her
02:45:14 because it, it builds character.
02:45:16 That's right.
02:45:17 I thought I should build my flex my creative muscles and try my hands.
02:45:23 So here I go.
02:45:24 Okay.
02:45:25 All right.
02:45:26 One, two, one, two, three.
02:45:30 My name is me and I'm here to say I'm going to diss you give in a big way.
02:45:38 You are a girl on the internet.
02:45:42 There's nothing on void.
02:45:43 You talk about things on this podcast with your friends.
02:45:48 You make funny jokes and cool art.
02:45:54 I've got something to say to you.
02:45:58 You suck.
02:46:00 That's my diss.
02:46:02 How does it feel?
02:46:05 I'll bet it feels like this.
02:46:08 Oh, there's the bad word.
02:46:10 Okay.
02:46:11 That's it.
02:46:12 Thank you.
02:46:13 Thanks for the voicemail.
02:46:14 Next one is called Noi to good three, two, one, go.
02:46:17 Hey, Ben, you know what Trixie's opinion on Noia is?
02:46:21 No.
02:46:22 Next one is called a good idea three, two, one, go.
02:46:27 All right.
02:46:28 This one's for free.
02:46:30 PCP DND.
02:46:33 Yeah.
02:46:35 We floated this idea.
02:46:36 I wanted to do one at Radcon.
02:46:38 We just didn't have time and it didn't happen.
02:46:40 What if we just did DND instead of a regular podcast for a few weeks?
02:46:45 Okay.
02:46:46 Or like alternating.
02:46:48 We could try that.
02:46:50 Okay.
02:46:51 Okay.
02:46:52 Yeah.
02:46:53 Let's do that.
02:46:54 Let's just fucking do that.
02:46:57 Why not?
02:46:58 I'm down.
02:47:00 I'm fucking into it.
02:47:02 Yeah.
02:47:03 I always wanted to do like a DND with the PCP and it just has never materialized.
02:47:08 It takes so much, it takes work though is the thing.
02:47:10 And I hate work.
02:47:11 Yeah.
02:47:12 And I guess if we're just two of us, it would be like, well, I do this and then you do that.
02:47:16 Yeah.
02:47:17 You can't do it with just two people.
02:47:19 We would need Tom in there.
02:47:21 We would need regular attendance because you can't.
02:47:27 I mean, you can sometimes miss a sesh, but you shouldn't be missing seshes.
02:47:32 Next one is Margar.
02:47:34 Oh, there we go.
02:47:35 Three, two, one, go.
02:47:38 Margar here.
02:47:40 As it turns out, I play a lot of Dungeons and Dragons, both as a dungeon master and a player.
02:47:47 And I have a number of opinions about some of the stuff you guys have talked about in terms of DND.
02:47:54 Namely, Ben and your opinion on players asking to make roles.
02:48:03 I think that a core aspect of Dungeons and Dragons is using the mechanics and abilities that your characters have to solve problems.
02:48:15 And I don't think that it's inherently a bad thing to ask DM to, you know, use your abilities in that way.
02:48:23 But it might just be a case of you having a different expectation of the game than it is sort of capable of providing.
02:48:31 And there are a number of games that you might prefer that aren't as sort of mechanically focused that I could maybe recommend to you.
02:48:41 Because there's a lot of games out there and they're all pretty different.
02:48:44 I generally do like role-playing games that are less mechanical than DND.
02:48:48 So I do think if you like the mechanical part of it, then maybe there is just a difference in expectation.
02:48:56 I really do think, though, that like, I really do think it's, I mean, you can have your own opinion,
02:49:04 but it's not the way that I want to play is not to be being like, hmm,
02:49:09 my character has seven ranks in a climb.
02:49:15 Hmm, can I make a climb check to ascend to heights of dazzling intellect? Hmm, DM, please?
02:49:26 You know, that's stupid.
02:49:29 A terrible example, but hopefully you understand what I'm saying.
02:49:34 Next voicemail is called Based Ben Believer, 3, 2, 1, go.
02:49:39 You know, I never thought it would happen, but a lot of people have been saying it lately and it's really true.
02:49:44 Ben truly is the most based member of the PCP now.
02:49:48 Thank you. I know.
02:49:49 All it took was Nate the Voo, Mage, Munchy, and Nate leaving the podcast, Tom not being on half the episodes,
02:49:54 and Gib being milk toast and never having a stance on anything.
02:49:59 And so that leaves Ben as the only person with actual informed opinions on things.
02:50:04 And just by default, he is the most based person on the podcast and it's just incredible, you know?
02:50:08 I really think the transition from Old Ben to Communist Ben was really rough and there were some real lows there.
02:50:14 He was maybe only slightly better than Munchy, you know, in the PCP member rating.
02:50:20 But overall, I mean, on the other side of it, Ben is more based than ever,
02:50:25 and I couldn't be happier for it, keeping based.
02:50:28 I have stances on things.
02:50:31 Thanks? I don't, I don't, I don't feel complimented.
02:50:36 No, fuck you. Fuck this guy. No.
02:50:41 No, fuck you.
02:50:44 Next voicemail is called Based Joker 3 3 2 1 Go.
02:50:48 When I tell my friends that I listen to the PCP, they say, hey, that's pretty based.
02:50:55 But when I tell my friends that I listen to the PCP, well, suddenly I'm cringe.
02:51:02 But see, that's the thing you people don't understand. I'm, I'm not cringe.
02:51:08 I'm just ahead of the turd.
02:51:11 Wait, that's it. That's the rebrand, the PussyPoo.
02:51:15 No.
02:51:16 Yes, that's it.
02:51:19 The PussyP, the PCP.
02:51:23 He said PCPoo, but I say why not change both?
02:51:27 The P-
02:51:28 The P-
02:51:29 Twice?
02:51:30 The P-E-E-C-P-O-O.
02:51:33 Perhaps.
02:51:34 Also, I should, I will say, I keep forgetting that this guy exists, and then he makes a voicemail as really, really good.
02:51:41 Voice Grail, I think.
02:51:42 Voice Grail for Based Joker?
02:51:44 Yeah, Based Joker.
02:51:46 You know what? He's had too many hits. I'll give him.
02:51:49 A Based Joker ascends to the Voice Grail. Congratulations.
02:51:53 First in a while, first in a while, but I think he's earned it.
02:51:57 Yeah.
02:51:58 Next voicemail is from Cross, and there's a YouTube link, and the link is to a video of like a, of like a, a no, like a, like a synth music setup.
02:52:08 Playing some synth sounds.
02:52:10 Three, two, one, go.
02:52:12 My friend Jake Ellis made this sick-ass space shanty.
02:52:15 It's like a sea shanty, but it's a space shanty.
02:52:18 Listen to it, please. He deserves it.
02:52:21 Here's a clip of it.
02:52:35 Pretty based. Pretty based.
02:52:38 Pretty good.
02:52:39 I guess I'll put, um, I guess I'll put the link in the description.
02:52:44 Yeah, in the show notes.
02:52:45 In the show notes.
02:52:46 Jake Ellis space shanty number one.
02:52:49 Sounds pretty based.
02:52:51 Next voicemail is called Put, Put, Prince.
02:52:53 Three, two, one, go.
02:52:57 Uh, third week now, I've had some ideas, but I don't think they're funny enough, even though I know these things aren't the highest.
02:53:07 But instead of like leaving a three second voicemail, I'll put my phone in and I'll leave it in song.
02:53:12 So, uh, kick it, Bonnie.
02:53:14 One, and a two, and a three.
02:53:17 This is...
02:53:26 I mean, as a big Simpsons fan, I have to appreciate it.
02:53:29 I appreciate the reference. It's classic.
02:53:45 Cool, man.
02:53:48 Nice voicemail. You're ascending the ranks.
02:53:52 Uh, uh, adding music is the first step towards becoming a classic voicemailer.
02:53:58 Historically speaking, it's true.
02:54:00 Next voicemail is called Really Quick Question, three, two, one, go.
02:54:07 Hey, PCP, it's me, Max Clutch.
02:54:10 I just wanted to get a quick...
02:54:12 This guy makes me nervous.
02:54:14 Is that Trixie?
02:54:26 See you next time, boys.
02:54:28 Okay.
02:54:29 What was the question?
02:54:30 I don't know.
02:54:32 Is that Trixie?
02:54:33 So Trixie, and he just gunned it.
02:54:35 The question is, is that Trixie?
02:54:37 The real question is, was he driving towards or away?
02:54:41 That's what I assumed a hit and run, but we just don't have enough information.
02:54:49 Next voicemail is called Fuck PCP Callers, three, two, one, go.
02:54:54 Alright, so I've started to catch back up with the PCP episodes as I rage at online Smash Bros.
02:54:59 And I just finished what I hope is the last of the Tommy J arc.
02:55:03 And this got me thinking about a rant that I've had brewing in my head for a while.
02:55:06 I fucking hate the PCP voicemail callers.
02:55:09 Why do they think that anyone gives a fuck who they are?
02:55:12 The sheer you on these people is insane.
02:55:14 I think it all started back with Riddle My Ass Batman.
02:55:17 Because when he became a recurring caller, everyone thought,
02:55:19 Ooh, her there, I'm gonna do that.
02:55:21 Except that they couldn't do that because they aren't creative or funny
02:55:24 and they don't have any sort of production value.
02:55:26 And then Samurai was the second wave of this.
02:55:29 And now all these obnoxious Kretans tried to rip him off.
02:55:32 You know why the Samurai works and you're a larping dozen, you fucks?
02:55:35 It's because the Samurai didn't make it about him.
02:55:37 It was always about Ben stealing the Skrull.
02:55:40 It's like if I felt the need to leave a voicemail every week going,
02:55:42 Hey guys, remember me? I'm fuck Dibuster.
02:55:45 I said that Dibuster is bad. Isn't that so cool how I said that Dibuster is bad?
02:55:49 By the way, I also write novels and draw.
02:55:52 That's so unique. You guys should follow me because I'm a one of a kind person.
02:55:56 And also please have me on the podcast.
02:55:58 No, no one gives a shit.
02:56:00 Anyway, I'm not actually that upset.
02:56:02 But hearing Ben rage at Tommy J was pretty funny.
02:56:05 Okay, then yeah, that should be the end of the Tommy J arc.
02:56:08 I think there is a lot of truth in what this guy is saying.
02:56:13 Yeah.
02:56:15 Yeah, like the whole league of Nate fuckers is kind of funny.
02:56:20 Nate isn't here to feel the brunt of the tidal wave of all of these funny things.
02:56:28 Yeah, but that's not that's not their fault.
02:56:31 No, but like some of the characters are just just explicitly made for that purpose.
02:56:36 And there's multiple of them.
02:56:39 Yeah, but each one is its own gimmick and it's it's just there for one call and then it's dropped.
02:56:45 Yeah, so I don't hate them or anything.
02:56:48 But like I feel like that that joke has sort of run its course.
02:56:52 I bet. Yeah, I mean, what more can you really do with it? I guess.
02:56:57 I guess we'll see.
02:56:59 The next voicemail. I think the last voicemail.
02:57:02 Thank Christ is called Mr. Suck and Fuck 3, 2, 1.
02:57:06 Speak and go.
02:57:08 Trixie, my golden princess.
02:57:17 I have such wonderful plans with her.
02:57:26 She still has her decadent vimosis.
02:57:33 No stop, please.
02:57:40 That excess for skin.
02:57:45 That hollow poop of blood.
02:57:49 This is like being in a fucking haunted house.
02:57:52 You feel it with strawberry ice cream.
02:58:00 Top it with sprinkles and chocolate syrup.
02:58:06 I'm getting hungry.
02:58:08 And then I'm going to...
02:58:16 Yeah, go, go, go, go, go.
02:58:19 Get it. Get it, Mr. Suck and Fuck 3.
02:58:25 Itadakimasu.
02:58:30 Gross. Terrible.
02:58:32 Itadakimasu.
02:58:35 Oh God, why? Why does it end like this?
02:58:40 Decadent. Well, I think that's a great note to go out on when you say.
02:58:45 Yeah, I think we fucked up.
02:58:47 We went over the limit.
02:58:50 Eleazar, just maybe you can snip out a minute here or there or two to get it under the three hours.
02:58:55 Sorry, fucked up, fucked up. So sorry.
02:58:58 Okay, that's it. Patreon.com slash the procrastinators bonus episodes.
02:59:02 Speakup.com slash PCB voicemail.
02:59:05 I think that's it.
02:59:07 Get the I Have COVID shirt and goodbye.
02:59:10 Goodbye.
