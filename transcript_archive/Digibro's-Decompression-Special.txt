00:00:00 You all thought Digibro's decompression chamber was cancelled, didn't you?
00:00:05 Well it is.
00:00:06 I stopped doing them.
00:00:07 This is the special edition, yay!
00:00:11 Special depressing podcast, just for you guys.
00:00:15 And to see, I love this idea that the PCP is becoming this mishmash of hilarious comedy
00:00:23 shows and then just utterly, gutturally depressing solo podcasts.
00:00:28 So this one is going to get extra meta, because this is kind of a response to the second episode
00:00:34 of Tom's hyperbolic wine chamber.
00:00:38 And if you didn't listen to that one to summarize it, essentially it's Tom, as usual, being
00:00:42 very hard on himself and talking about his need to earn his keep in The Pro Crastinators
00:00:47 by feeling like he's under-talented and not doing enough, I don't know why he thinks
00:00:52 he has to earn his keep, no one's ever said anything of the sort, but you know, Tom's
00:00:57 always pretty down on himself.
00:00:58 Personally, I think Tom will always be in the PCP because I like Tom, I like having
00:01:03 him around, I hope he keeps living, um, might be selfish of me to say so, but uh, but anyways,
00:01:12 I want to respond to it, because in it, Tom has some admiration for me and Jesse and
00:01:21 Monkey Jones.
00:01:23 And this is not just about Tom, this is also about a lot of The Pro Crastinators fans,
00:01:29 a lot of my fans in general, a lot of people who look up to us, um, you know, even within
00:01:36 our own group, I mean, just as Tom looks at, you know, looks at us and feels like he's
00:01:40 not doing enough or isn't, isn't talented enough, I've always felt the same way looking
00:01:44 at Jesse, I've always felt Jesse was exponentially more talented than me, and you know, I really
00:01:49 struggle with the idea that the videos I make aren't really doing anything artistically
00:01:55 in comparison to what Jesse's doing, you know, and I mean, I have a lot more self-confidence
00:01:59 and I enjoy my own content a lot more than I think Tom enjoys his own content.
00:02:04 So like I'm able to find a reason for it to exist, uh, but you know, I still feel it
00:02:09 pales in comparison to Jesse, but I think the difference I have in mindset here and
00:02:14 that like the perspective I want everyone to keep, everybody, everybody in our audience,
00:02:18 Tom, myself, everyone, is that nothing about this is admirable, nothing about what any
00:02:25 of us is doing is admirable, and none of us is really happy doing this.
00:02:33 I need, I need to stress this.
00:02:36 If you look up to us because you want your life to be like us, what you're going to
00:02:41 get is not going to be a life of satisfaction and happiness.
00:02:47 You're not going, if you're trying to pursue, I want to have the exact same career that
00:02:51 those guys have or the same art that they have, like none of us is someone who sits
00:02:58 around being satisfied with our lives and, and is like, and is like super okay with the
00:03:06 way things stand or the way they are, you know, and maybe you think it'll be different
00:03:10 for you, maybe you think it's not going to turn out the same way, but I just want you
00:03:15 to like before you go looking up to what we do, just remember that we're doing this largely
00:03:19 out of being broken people who can't function normally in society, either because of the
00:03:26 circumstances surrounding us, or just because I don't know, I don't know what's wrong
00:03:31 with us.
00:03:32 I mean, Monkey Jones has a channel called Monkey's Countdown to Suicide in which he
00:03:37 is constantly reassuring everyone of the fact that he will kill himself.
00:03:43 He hates being alive.
00:03:45 He is a depressed suicidal man.
00:03:48 You know, it's cool that he got a book written, like I know that's what Tom was admiring
00:03:53 about him is that Tom, you know, also wants to write a book and he read Monkeys and he
00:03:56 really admired Monkeys writing, but writing that book has not made Monkey not suicidal.
00:04:03 And all he's gotten out of it is that it paid his rent for one month.
00:04:06 You know, it's sold incredibly well for a self-published book, which is to say it made
00:04:13 like $600, you know, and paid his rent for one month at a crucial moment when he was
00:04:19 in between moving and, you know, needed that money because he couldn't get a job during
00:04:23 that month.
00:04:24 So it's not like he's got spending money as a result of the book.
00:04:28 It just covered his living expense.
00:04:30 You know, his Patreon's not super successful or anything.
00:04:33 He's not living off of it.
00:04:35 He hopes to be possibly, but I'm pretty sure when he moves to North Carolina, he's going
00:04:40 to get a normal job, you know, writing that book.
00:04:43 That book will never be publishable.
00:04:45 He knows it himself.
00:04:46 The book has an 11-year-old rubbing cum all over her body.
00:04:50 Spoilers.
00:04:51 He doesn't like it when I tell people that.
00:04:55 So that's, you know, being Monkey Jones, you might see it as artistically fulfilling
00:05:05 because you admire his art more than your own, but Monkey Jones himself is not happy
00:05:11 with it.
00:05:12 Like if you were in his shoes, you wouldn't be happy.
00:05:15 He's not a happy person.
00:05:18 If you were Endless Jess, Endless Jess, his art comes almost exclusively through adversity,
00:05:26 through just the horrible things that are happening to him constantly.
00:05:31 This is a man who was already depressed and didn't want to fly across the country to make
00:05:37 a bunch of videos at the time that he, you know, that we did a Kickstarter, so he kind
00:05:42 of had to, but he flies down here, you know, works through his crushing depression for
00:05:47 just long enough to finish these videos, goes home, and his fucking house is flooded and
00:05:52 everything's ruined.
00:05:54 And he's sick and he's just like, you know, sifting through the ashes of his dead life,
00:06:00 trying to harness nuggets of art out of that just to make money to live.
00:06:06 Jesse doesn't want to be doing YouTube videos.
00:06:09 He's doing it because he's broke and he has no other choice, you know?
00:06:14 I just, he's not happy with it.
00:06:18 He doesn't like his work that much.
00:06:21 He's usually dissatisfied with his videos.
00:06:23 He's looking back at them, you know, like, as much as we look up to it, as much as we
00:06:28 look at it and go, wow, Jesse, the stuff you're doing is so amazing, I admire you so much.
00:06:33 None of that matters to him because where that art is coming from is a, you know, it's
00:06:39 a place that's, it's a dark place.
00:06:42 And this is sort of the subject of this song that me and Jesse made called Paradise recently,
00:06:48 because a while back, me and Jesse made this song called Get Action.
00:06:52 And the point of this song was to shit on everybody who wasn't putting in as much work
00:06:59 as we were, but it was not necessarily meant to inspire people, which is what it did.
00:07:06 And we both saw it as kind of ironic and maybe even dangerous.
00:07:10 I mean, I do say in the song, you know, you have to get action, you got to put your life
00:07:13 on the line, you got to go all out if you want to be as good as us.
00:07:17 But it wasn't my intention to suggest that you want to be as good as us.
00:07:22 I was merely like, like the anger of that song is in people looking at me like I don't
00:07:28 know what I'm doing.
00:07:29 You know, like the point of it was to say, I am amazing at this, I'm built for this,
00:07:33 I've done nothing but practice this, this is my life.
00:07:36 So don't, don't try to say, like don't even look at me for advice unless you're willing
00:07:42 to put this level of insane effort in.
00:07:44 But it's not me saying that you should put this level of insane effort in, that you
00:07:48 should become this person.
00:07:51 Because when I look at what I am, I spend 50% of all my time sitting around wondering
00:07:58 what the fuck am I doing with my life.
00:08:00 You know, I sleep for ridiculous amounts of my day.
00:08:04 I sleep through as much of the day as possible and the only way that I manage to get through
00:08:09 because of the fact that there's nothing happening in my life.
00:08:13 The reason I'm so productive is not because I have a great work ethic, in fact I don't
00:08:17 even think I have a good work ethic because actual work, like work that, like if I wanted
00:08:22 to be making money and doing like the right kind of videos and like putting out stuff
00:08:28 that's gonna advance my career and stuff like that or like sometimes I write, I have a main
00:08:33 series video that needs to get done and I put it off for days to just go make a bunch
00:08:38 of bullshit and I'm not making the bullshit because I think it's good work, I'm doing
00:08:42 it because I'm fucking bored and I don't know what else to do with myself, I don't
00:08:45 know how to live a normal life, I don't know how to do anything other than make YouTube
00:08:49 videos, I'm just a machine built for this.
00:08:52 It's not admirable, it produces fun art for all of you but like wanting to be like me,
00:08:59 I don't think you should and keep in mind because in everyone else's case I can say
00:09:06 like they're throwing themselves against a brick wall with maybe seemingly no reward,
00:09:12 no matter how much Jesse works he can't get himself out of that shitty house, no matter
00:09:15 how much Tom works he can't get himself out of his shitty house, no matter how much
00:09:19 Monkey works, well we don't know, Monkey's kind of up in the air because he's about
00:09:23 to move, Hippo just wants to have a breakthrough, he's making all these videos, just trying
00:09:29 to have one of them get big enough that his channel can actually sustain, Hippo's talking
00:09:34 all the time about how he's not sure if he should keep doing YouTube forever because
00:09:37 it just hasn't fucking broken through, it's been three years you know and for all of them
00:09:44 there's that aspect but that's not true of me, I am successful, I made $50,000 last year,
00:09:53 I made more than a lot of your parents probably made, you know I made a lot of money, I had
00:09:58 a successful year, this is a career, this is a real career for me, that hasn't made
00:10:04 it happy, it's given me lots of perks, it's given me great ways to get through this crushing
00:10:12 nihilistic depression, you know, I'm able to survive and to come off as like you know enjoying
00:10:22 myself because I constantly distract myself, I constantly make videos because when I'm
00:10:27 not making videos I'm just sitting around with myself and the only ways that I know
00:10:32 how to escape that are to just go and eat, you know I go out to a restaurant and I try
00:10:37 to waste as much time as I can, I go out you know I fucking drive across town, go to some
00:10:43 far flung restaurant and I have a nice meal and I enjoy myself, yeah that's cool, it's
00:10:47 a perk that I get for having so much money and being successful on YouTube but it's just
00:10:52 there to make me not think about what I'm doing at home, you know I've developed a shopping
00:10:58 addiction because every day I want to go out and go somewhere and be not at home for as
00:11:04 long as possible so I feel like I'm doing anything with my life so I'll go out to just some store
00:11:10 and just wander around until I buy something, you know just to just to have that thrill of
00:11:15 purchasing a thing and taking it home, you know, I'll, I drink all the time, you know I get bored,
00:11:24 I can't stand being alone with my thoughts so I just start drinking, you know, or I make another
00:11:30 video, just do anything to distract me from the fact that I'm not doing anything and I don't know
00:11:34 how to do anything, making all this money hasn't taught me how to do that, it hasn't taught me
00:11:40 how to get out of the house, how to how to meet new people, how to like make connections, how to
00:11:44 figure out what's wrong because this is not how I envisioned my life was going to be when I was
00:11:51 growing up, you know, like I always thought that the road towards success was going to be from
00:11:59 escaping this, like I thought when, because this is what I've been doing since I was a teenager,
00:12:04 I've been locked in my room, you know, sitting on the internet talking about anime for over 10 years
00:12:10 now, this is all I've ever been doing and back then when it didn't seem like there was a career
00:12:15 to be made out of this, when it seemed like this was just this was just throwing shit into the void
00:12:21 that no one would ever care about, you know, which is how it was for over five years, may I remind
00:12:26 everyone, I have only been successful for as long as I was doing this completely unsuccessfully
00:12:33 to an audience of no one, you know, I started anime writing in 2007, I spent five years before I even
00:12:39 had a YouTube channel, you know, and even then another year before it was successful enough to
00:12:44 consider a job, you know, and another two years after that before it was a job that that was
00:12:48 above minimum wage, but like in all that time, I always thought that the road to being successful
00:12:58 would mean getting out of the house, going out and finding something to do out in the world,
00:13:04 and so the fact that I found work here that I was able to be successful without changing anything,
00:13:11 what that feels like it's telling me is that I won't ever change anything, like why
00:13:17 why would I change if I can be successful just staying here, but this kind of success,
00:13:23 this doesn't feel right to me, like I'm not happy with the idea that I'm a guy who just
00:13:29 lives in his room all the time, I want to be someone who goes out and does things and has
00:13:34 stories to tell, who meets people, who goes places, like I really admire and look up to people who
00:13:42 have like a storied life, you know, and I don't have that, all I have is, I mean I do all these
00:13:49 fucking podcasts and let's plays where always the story is, well I watched a lot of anime this week
00:13:54 and I made a whole bunch of videos, that's what I was up to, you know, like I can't tell stories
00:13:59 about what's happened in my life, because nothing's happening, and like there's a huge part of me that
00:14:06 always thought things would be different, and I'm standing here like, but how do I even justify it,
00:14:11 how do I even justify leaving the house, you know, and it's not like I want to do something else,
00:14:17 because I love doing this job, but I could, like I just don't know how to branch out, I don't know
00:14:23 where to go, because I'm just broken, I'm broken in the mind, the reason I'm able to have such
00:14:30 an amazing work ethic is because I am broken in the mind, so before you go looking up to me
00:14:38 and what I do, take a step back and ask yourself, do you actually want this life,
00:14:45 because this is what it will cost you, you'll have to spend five plus years working in complete
00:14:52 obscurity just to hone your skills, that's what it took, I've been doing this non-stop for 10 years,
00:15:01 I started my anime blog in 2007, I was writing, there were times in 2009, I had a post out every
00:15:07 day, sometimes three posts a day, you know, I had 59 posts in the month of February 2009,
00:15:14 I remember that, no one read any of those, I was just grinding material, and then finally it got good
00:15:21 enough and I figured out a platform where people would actually watch the shit, and then another
00:15:26 five years to get actually successful, you know, I've got 10,000 hours in this shit, that's why
00:15:31 I'm good at it, so first you gotta be willing to just waste years of your life, and I got lucky
00:15:37 in that I got to waste those years young, you know, if you're already my age, get ready to
00:15:42 waste the next 10, I mean you probably have a leg up on 15 year old me who was just garbage
00:15:49 at writing, you know, it had no worldview whatsoever because I was so young, you've got a leg up on
00:15:54 that, but expect to take some time, you know, now the next thing you have to be ready for is to lose
00:16:01 all social connections in all of your friends, I used to have a group of friends who was at my
00:16:06 house all the time, none of them are here anymore, I don't talk to any of them because we have nothing
00:16:11 in common, because all I do is work, this is my whole life, I don't relate to anybody, the only
00:16:18 people I relate to are other people doing the same thing, which is why I'm in the PCP and why
00:16:22 those are my only fucking friends, so you have to be ready to burn away your social connections,
00:16:29 to spend all your time on this, to burn away your health, because in the process of trying
00:16:34 to make videos constantly, you will sit in a chair for, you know, dozens of hours a day,
00:16:43 I know there's only two dozen in a day, but you know, I sit in this chair 12 hours a day,
00:16:49 that's a fair statement, you know, assuming I'm awake for that long out of a day, I am always
00:16:56 here working and I just don't, you know, I don't really find time for health and upkeep and personal
00:17:05 fucking like grooming or anything, like that stuff doesn't come naturally to me, all of my teeth
00:17:11 are falling out of my fucking skull, I keep getting fatter, I've become an alcoholic, I was addicted
00:17:16 to cigarettes for a little while, you know, I'm trying to keep away from that, but I'm fairly
00:17:22 certain I'm gonna end up smoking again before too very long, because it just looks too cool not to do
00:17:27 it, like, you know, I quit smoking and I quit caffeine for the last few weeks, because of the
00:17:36 fact that I started having anxiety attacks and, you know, I looked up what causes anxiety and it
00:17:42 was a lot of the things I was doing, so I cut those things out and I have stopped having anxiety
00:17:46 problems since doing that, it's just made me incredibly lethargic and I've just been laying
00:17:51 around staring at the ceiling all day, you know, like, I'm always bouncing between those two extremes,
00:17:57 it's always either I don't want to do anything or I want to do everything and it's driving me insane
00:18:01 and why do I still live here and why am I still acting this way and am I ever going to be normal
00:18:05 because even when I find myself in situations where I should be able to talk to people,
00:18:10 I completely fail at it, you know, I just, I don't want people to look at me and think that
00:18:18 because I'm making videos all the time and I'm making lots of money that you want that life,
00:18:25 because what that life comes with is just this constant feeling that you're doing something wrong,
00:18:33 that this wasn't what you were supposed to be doing, that like this isn't what the world,
00:18:40 you know, told you you were meant to be doing growing up, you know, and it's not that I don't
00:18:48 like this job because I do and this job is what's keeping me from being completely depressed because
00:18:54 anytime I try to just say I'm going to put distance between myself and this job,
00:18:59 I just do nothing, you know, I don't know how to do anything else, this job is the only thing I
00:19:03 have, but I don't think it's something to seek out, you know, if you have the opportunity to go
00:19:08 do something interesting and normal, I would encourage that, you know, normalcy is not a
00:19:15 bad thing to pursue, it's stability, it's like the idea of normal is that there's nothing wrong
00:19:23 with you, you know, like to do this kind of job you have to have something wrong with you,
00:19:30 something kind of broken, you know, and I mean not to say that it can't be fun, it can be and
00:19:39 if you do get really successful, like I totally encourage best guy ever to keep going on the
00:19:44 path he's going to eventually get successful at YouTube and to, you know, make enough money
00:19:48 out because he's going to treat it like he treats his job anyways, you know, it's just going to be
00:19:53 a more creatively fulfilling version of what he was doing and I kind of almost admire all these
00:19:58 YouTubers who do just like treat it like work, you know, these guys who are just doing it as a
00:20:03 job because the way people consume it doesn't change if you do it as a job versus doing it as
00:20:09 art, you know, and I worry that guys like us are just inspiring a whole a whole fucking group of
00:20:17 people who are setting themselves up for disappointment because either you're going to go down the
00:20:22 road of constantly straining yourself trying to become an artist and failing and getting depressed
00:20:27 over it or actually becoming an artist and realizing that it doesn't bring you any more
00:20:33 happiness than what you already had, you know, except in the the mere pride that you can eke
00:20:40 out of the fact that you did what you wanted to do, which I guess is what keeps us all going in the
00:20:45 long run. Anyway, yeah, that's that, I guess.
00:21:15 Nice.
00:21:28 Give me an mentor to all who admire me. I know it fired me if I had ever hired me.
00:21:33 And I mean by firing squad. I'm gayer than God and deserve to be deader than a door now.
00:21:39 That's love but I quit smoking so I won't be choking on anything other than dick for a while.
00:21:44 Never been in style. They didn't like something of a prick in its wild or some punk to act like
00:21:49 I stabbed someone just because I gave a one to their favorite show. Do you even know what is
00:21:54 an opinion? Objectivity doesn't exist. I told you a million times. There is no rule to write no
00:22:01 design. Only what you decide you like at this time and I hate myself. So don't emulate me unless
00:22:07 you're better with self-help.
00:22:29 Trillion fans ain't worth a damn. They ain't worth one friend. I can't call my man.
00:22:34 Ambition is living how others won't floor a vision and a mission. Getting what others don't but
00:22:39 that's missing the mark. Given every spark makes your heart dark because ambition is a prison.
00:22:43 Not a walk in the park. I've had best friends tell me that they envy me and look with jealousy
00:22:48 like I'm the enemy, like I'm a rival. But when you ain't a rival to me, I'm rival. My survival
00:22:53 two miles of trials would be tragedy if not for the fact that I'm getting back to my family.
00:22:57 Nothing else helps or is held to have you mad at me because I'm broken. I don't know how long
00:23:02 you've spent. Since I've seen the sun or put my lungs with oxygen, I'm too far gone. I take
00:23:06 norminess over this. Gotta check the pulse of my wrist to know I exist.
00:23:32 I go wild, I go wild, I go wild.
