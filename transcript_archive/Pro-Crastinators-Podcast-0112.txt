00:00:00 Hello and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:28 I am the best guy ever, and today we're joined by Lethal Aurora Mage.
00:00:54 Today's PCP is brought to you by My Burning Rage, aka Fighting.
00:01:20 That's what the topic is.
00:01:25 My deep frustration at the female gender for not condescending to have sex with me.
00:01:30 I will fight them for this.
00:01:36 Where is it?
00:01:37 Why is it?
00:01:38 What could it be?
00:01:39 You're the worst.
00:01:40 You're so bad at intro-ings, topics that you didn't think was good.
00:01:44 This is a real shit.
00:01:45 What do you mean where is fighting?
00:01:47 Let's just fight about this right now.
00:01:49 Where did it go?
00:01:50 Why is fighting not a thing we can just do in society?
00:01:52 It sounds like you want to fight about it.
00:01:54 Why are we all trying to be fucking civilized and advanced?
00:01:57 Why aren't we supposed to address the previous episode thingy segment, or do we do it?
00:02:02 Actually, that happens after our main section here.
00:02:04 We do the whole big topic and then we do that thing.
00:02:07 Now I have to remember for like an hour.
00:02:08 Is there something special you want to mention though?
00:02:09 We could do it.
00:02:10 Yes.
00:02:11 Is something important you want to bring up?
00:02:12 Yeah, because I was contacted by a concerned Lithuanian because of the last episode and
00:02:18 he was concerned that I painted a poor image of Lithuania.
00:02:23 What do you mean poor?
00:02:25 It sounds like a fallout for Radioactive, awesome.
00:02:29 I just want to clarify, you know, that was, I'm picturing Mad Max basically, like Mad
00:02:34 Max, Lithuania.
00:02:35 I haven't seen Mad Max, so I can't confirm.
00:02:39 People can use their imaginations.
00:02:41 Yeah, just keep in mind that was back when I was a little kid and I was born just a year
00:02:45 after Lithuania got its independence.
00:02:48 So it was kind of a little bit in chaos and I'm not sure maybe in the capital it was
00:02:53 better than it was where I lived, but those experiences, you know, those are, that's
00:02:59 how I lived.
00:03:00 I lived in a poor family in a poor neighborhood and that was my experience.
00:03:05 However, I want to make note that like today, Lithuania has done a lot of work to be a lot
00:03:11 more presentable and it's all pretty and nice and even where I live now, it's like
00:03:15 super nice.
00:03:16 I even see tourists.
00:03:17 That's so weird.
00:03:18 Tourists.
00:03:19 Imagine that.
00:03:21 My little town.
00:03:22 That's so weird.
00:03:24 This was before they came to see all the fighting.
00:03:26 That's what they came to see.
00:03:27 Yeah.
00:03:28 They want to see the roaming gangs.
00:03:30 This is before Mage, quote unquote, painted the town purple, if you will.
00:03:33 I was going to say, the Lithuania was independent and then its new savior was born to bring
00:03:38 it into a new age of purple and greatness.
00:03:41 The Lithuanian warrior who would bring the super predators to heal, the violent violence,
00:03:48 if you will.
00:03:50 Well, the rebels.
00:03:51 Oh my God.
00:03:52 The violent violence.
00:03:53 Dude.
00:03:54 That's fighting.
00:03:55 Fighting guys is real and here it is.
00:03:58 What is fighting?
00:03:59 I'm going to tell you.
00:04:00 In some countries such as South Korea, fighting is used as words of cheer.
00:04:05 The meaning of fighting is similar to the meaning of let's go or do your best or good
00:04:09 luck.
00:04:10 Oh my God.
00:04:11 Fight on.
00:04:12 This is like, you ever see an anime when like you'll see like sexy anime girls will
00:04:16 like be cheering on their friends and they'll go, fight all, fight all.
00:04:20 I think that's, and that just means like do, like do your best, do some, do some work.
00:04:25 Urban dictionary.
00:04:26 This is actually the worst definition you've ever forced me to read.
00:04:28 I'm going to beat the shit out of this master and work.
00:04:31 Yeah, I was going to say definitely.
00:04:33 And it's holding a gun to your head.
00:04:34 Here's a better one.
00:04:35 Here's a better one.
00:04:36 Definition two, fighting, physical contact, or in other cases arguing or disagreeing with
00:04:40 others, including teammates like dance groups, soccer clubs, what the fuck.
00:04:46 I don't know why it brought these up.
00:04:49 It's such a weird way to put it.
00:04:51 Like fighting is like a disagreement between human beings such as dance groups.
00:04:56 Yes.
00:04:57 Like, are you aware of these types of groups of, are they just like really a big, big fan
00:05:02 of like fucking like dance off movies or something and they're just like, yeah, yeah.
00:05:06 Okay.
00:05:07 It's like, bring it on.
00:05:08 Bring it on or something.
00:05:09 Yeah.
00:05:10 I mean, okay.
00:05:11 Okay.
00:05:12 All right.
00:05:13 We're fucking entries on Urban Dictionary.
00:05:14 That's a little terrible.
00:05:15 Yeah.
00:05:16 The right kind.
00:05:17 Man.
00:05:18 All right.
00:05:19 I want to start.
00:05:20 Okay.
00:05:21 Go for it.
00:05:22 Go for it.
00:05:23 I want to start by saying the, the fights that I've had in my youth and adult life, which
00:05:27 are like innumerable.
00:05:29 I kill everyone I see.
00:05:31 No, it's actually, it's actually, I've never really had a proper fight.
00:05:34 I've been in lots of like little boy scuffles in the playground where you sort of push
00:05:38 each other and sort of grab at things, but you don't really do anything and, and you
00:05:43 know, kick.
00:05:44 But like, um, I've never punched someone in, in the jaw, like a good old fisticuss, except
00:05:49 for that one time D'Vu asked us all to do that to him for a, for a, for a meme, a rad
00:05:55 car.
00:05:56 And I was like, one of the most uncomfortable moments of my entire life, I remember that.
00:06:00 The way I saw it was like, Oh, D'Vu, are you sure?
00:06:04 Because I want to do that.
00:06:06 Not because it's you, but because I just want to know what it feels like to really punch
00:06:10 someone in the jaw.
00:06:11 And he was like, yeah, go on, go on, do it.
00:06:13 And I'm like, all right, this is going to be cool.
00:06:15 And I did it.
00:06:17 And now I know what it means to be a fighter.
00:06:18 I'm a fucking UFC champion.
00:06:21 How hard did you hit him?
00:06:22 Um, I didn't go like as hard as I possibly could because you did not clean his clock.
00:06:27 No, I didn't actually want to hurt him, but like, I wanted to make him like, because he
00:06:31 was saying explicitly, I wanted to make him regret this decision.
00:06:35 And he explicitly said, no, as hard as you can, I'm like, all right, I'll hit you hard
00:06:38 then.
00:06:39 I will hit you hard.
00:06:40 Well, that's because he's a madman.
00:06:41 Yeah.
00:06:42 And so I, you know, I put pretty, you know, I've never punched someone.
00:06:44 So I don't know whether it was actually a strong punch or not.
00:06:47 Probably wasn't.
00:06:48 Yeah.
00:06:49 But like, yeah, that's, that's my, that's my, it feels satisfactory.
00:06:51 Was your curiosity sated by this blow?
00:06:54 Um, I mean, if you crave more bloodshed, you want to wake in the beast within, you know,
00:07:01 what it did.
00:07:02 And I pushed everyone in the chin every single day.
00:07:06 Hand shakes are just too beta now.
00:07:08 It's a punch in the jaw.
00:07:10 That's how you say hi.
00:07:12 I distinctly remember that.
00:07:13 Uh, and I, if who asked me to do, I mean, you know, everyone who was there did ride
00:07:17 con too.
00:07:18 Uh, I gave him like the lightest of taps because it was just so, just strange situation
00:07:22 to be in.
00:07:23 Uh, but anyway, but anyway, getting away from that, um, I also have never, ever been in
00:07:29 a proper fight.
00:07:30 But when I was young, I did do, I took like a handful of karate classes.
00:07:34 I, I'm pretty sure I did that.
00:07:35 I might even be wrong.
00:07:36 No, no, I'm pretty sure I did.
00:07:38 Um, I went there and we like grappled a little bit.
00:07:41 I mean, because I was like really young when I did it, like, like 10, maybe.
00:07:46 I can remember 10 years old.
00:07:48 10 years old was when I started my Pokemon journey and I've never stopped ever since.
00:07:51 I do remember playing Pokemon.
00:07:52 I remember a D this made me want to fight.
00:07:55 I remember the deep frustration I had at not being able to figure out how to leave the
00:07:59 first house in Pokemon red, because you have to walk down on the carpet on the bottom
00:08:04 of the house.
00:08:05 Why the hell would that mean you have to leave?
00:08:06 And to that day, I've hated Pokemon forever.
00:08:08 Well, I mean, that took me all of like 15 seconds to figure it out.
00:08:12 Well, fuck you.
00:08:13 It didn't make any sense.
00:08:14 I know the feeling because I think I made that mistake as well in Pokemon blue.
00:08:18 Bad conveyance.
00:08:19 Bad conveyance.
00:08:20 That's what it was.
00:08:21 Get out of here.
00:08:22 You go after it.
00:08:23 Um, yeah, exactly.
00:08:24 I, I know I was, I went to karate classes.
00:08:26 I played Pokemon at the karate classes.
00:08:28 I went there all the time.
00:08:29 We did sparring.
00:08:30 It was cool.
00:08:31 And I fought and it was sick and it's, and it was like with pads and stuff.
00:08:35 I got into one fight in school and it was the, the, the, I didn't, I didn't get to hit
00:08:40 anybody, but I did have an awesome shown in the anime moment.
00:08:43 Um, so, so the whole, the reason there was like backstory to this fight is that there
00:08:47 was this kid who constantly picked on me and gave me shit.
00:08:52 And I was like a fat tubby beta bitch back in the day.
00:08:54 Okay.
00:08:56 So I would just like fucking roll over and let this guy steam roll over me and it pissed
00:08:59 me off more and more.
00:09:00 Like, and this went on for like two or three years.
00:09:02 He would like steal all my stuff and like all this crazy shit.
00:09:06 And then one day just like in gym class, I forget something, something happened, something
00:09:09 snapped and we got into like a legitimate like fight and, and, and, and I just like
00:09:14 got up in his face and I do just fucking leave me alone.
00:09:16 I'm sick of this shit.
00:09:17 And he just cold cocked me right in the face and I can fucking like my lips started bleeding
00:09:22 and everything.
00:09:23 And it was like, everything froze for a second and everybody stopped and I just stood there
00:09:26 like totally unfazed by his blow and just wiped the blood away.
00:09:29 And then he immediately ran like fucking bolted.
00:09:33 And so he was much faster than me.
00:09:35 So I could not catch up to him, but, um, he ran.
00:09:38 I thought you ran.
00:09:39 No, no, no, no, no, no, I was ready to fucking lay this guy out because like I'm a big fat
00:09:44 guy. So I'm twice his size, but he's twice as fast.
00:09:47 So I'm trying to chase after him and he's running away.
00:09:49 And then the gym teacher breaks us up right as I'm about to lay into him because he like
00:09:53 got to the door and was too scared to open the door.
00:09:55 And I was about to fucking unload.
00:09:57 And then we got sent to the principal's office and I got suspended too.
00:10:00 If we're getting punched in the face, that's so strange the way that works.
00:10:03 That seems to be like how it works.
00:10:05 Like when there's a fight, they suspend both people, even if one like is the obvious
00:10:09 aggressor, I guess it's because.
00:10:13 Well, they think you're a fucking pussy.
00:10:14 I mean, I don't actually know.
00:10:16 I don't know if it does happen to me when I hear something funny.
00:10:19 Yes. OK, so like in my childhood, there was
00:10:22 a kid that I would fight a lot with and he was a cubby boy as well.
00:10:26 And his name was Tom. Oh, oh, oh, my God.
00:10:30 You cold cocks me and J-Class mage, mage.
00:10:35 And then you ran away to Lithuania.
00:10:36 This is what was a purple blur. I never knew.
00:10:39 Deep floor.
00:10:40 I was a boy then, apparently, as well.
00:10:43 Jesus.
00:10:45 Damn, well, that's fascinating.
00:10:46 We've had trans representation of the PCP this entire time.
00:10:50 That's true. That's true.
00:10:51 For all of our horrible comments.
00:10:52 Well, I'm a trans anime girl.
00:10:54 But beyond that, like, Tom, did you?
00:10:57 So like, do you remember at all what sparked that?
00:11:00 Like, what finally made him hit you?
00:11:01 I think I think it was just some stupid, like, bullshit about whatever we were
00:11:05 doing in gym class.
00:11:06 But it was like, it was it was just like a thinly veiled excuse for everything
00:11:10 that had been building up over these last two or three years to finally.
00:11:13 The straw that broke the camel's back. Correct.
00:11:15 So that's that's how that's how it happened.
00:11:17 And you know what?
00:11:19 That that is that, you know, that it's very interesting.
00:11:22 There was a similar story that did not happen to me,
00:11:25 but happened to one of my close friends.
00:11:26 Let's call him a rocket.
00:11:28 I've decided I want to start not saying people's actual names.
00:11:30 OK, so. So rocket raccoon was your buddy.
00:11:33 Basically, yeah. OK.
00:11:34 So so so rocket here.
00:11:37 There was this guy.
00:11:38 We were, you know, this was a freshman year in college, as I recall.
00:11:41 And I got to know this guy like halfway through freshman year.
00:11:45 And we became great friends.
00:11:47 But like later on in freshman year, there was this guy.
00:11:51 I believe his name. I'm going to say his name.
00:11:53 I believe his name was Rishi. I believe his name was Rishi.
00:11:56 He was like an Indian name or something.
00:11:57 I don't remember.
00:11:59 But it was something like that Rishi.
00:12:00 And so this guy was just like an IRL shit poster
00:12:05 who would do things like you'd be getting food with the guy.
00:12:09 And he'd say something.
00:12:10 He'd be like, oh, man, I really want like vanilla ice cream.
00:12:13 And you'd be like, oh, yeah, I really like vanilla.
00:12:15 He'd be like, haha, I hate vanilla. It sucks. It's shit. Got you.
00:12:20 And then you're like, oh, OK.
00:12:22 No, it was things along that line.
00:12:24 Like he would simply like just say falsehoods
00:12:27 and then catch you in believing his lies.
00:12:30 Just a very mundane things like that.
00:12:33 Just and I guess it gave him some sort of jolly, some sort of thrill.
00:12:37 But so the point is just like he would he did this like for this
00:12:40 for the whole year.
00:12:41 He lived on the same floor as Rocket.
00:12:43 And Rocket is this short Jewish kid,
00:12:48 whatever, like good friend of mine.
00:12:49 But the thing is he had done Krav Maga, I believe was Krav Maga.
00:12:52 I might just be saying that because he's Jewish,
00:12:53 but I'm pretty sure it was Krav Maga.
00:12:55 What is that?
00:12:55 And so he knew he knew his shit.
00:12:57 He knew how to handle himself.
00:13:00 Oh, Krav Maga is like the Israeli martial arts.
00:13:02 They do the army gets trained.
00:13:04 So it's it's serious.
00:13:05 It's like this is how Gal Gadot took out those Palestinian children.
00:13:09 Krav Maga.
00:13:10 So we're talking about the serious shown in shit.
00:13:12 All right.
00:13:13 And so what one day Rishi, just for whatever reason,
00:13:18 to be the hilarious madman that he was simply stood in front of of Rocket's
00:13:23 door with his hands like across like blocking the door and just said,
00:13:27 ha, ha, you can't come into your room like Rocket's room.
00:13:31 Rishi, who did not live with him, was just standing there
00:13:34 saying you can't come into your room.
00:13:37 And Rocket is is is is a is a small, calm, peaceful creature.
00:13:41 But at this something snapped, something snapped at this moment.
00:13:45 He had simply had enough.
00:13:47 So so my boy Rocket just calmly lifts his fucking leg,
00:13:53 twist himself sideways and just fucking donkey kicks him right in the fucking
00:13:57 chest and sends him a hurdling across the fucking room, crashing into a pile
00:14:01 on the other side of the fucking room and has vacated the doorway now.
00:14:04 Let's go.
00:14:06 That's how you handle problems.
00:14:07 That's how you handle fucking people giving you shit.
00:14:10 And so Rishi just stands up, goes, what the fuck, dude?
00:14:12 And then just runs away and that's that's what it was.
00:14:16 That that's what that kind of leads me into something I wanted to bring up
00:14:19 and kind of you're a hero rocket.
00:14:20 But God, the main reasons I decided to be on this episode.
00:14:23 Do you think?
00:14:24 Because I do think I think that we have we have unjustly banished fighting
00:14:29 from our our culture.
00:14:31 I think absolutely.
00:14:32 I think I think it's I think there's just something primal in us
00:14:35 that like physical conflict can solve problems and strengthen bonds and make
00:14:39 and clear things up quickly and efficiently through physical combat.
00:14:42 And I think exercising that for more sophisticated means of conflict
00:14:47 resolution has made us worse as a species.
00:14:50 Yeah, I definitely agree.
00:14:52 I just think I definitely I feel like you know what's interesting,
00:14:54 mate, I was going to say, I bet this issue is a very male, female divide.
00:14:58 I was everybody.
00:14:59 I kind of I kind of agree with that, mate.
00:15:02 It's just the way the brains work and stuff.
00:15:06 I feel like there's definitely male bonding that I've never truly experienced
00:15:09 by eating a shit out of somebody and then coming to resolution.
00:15:14 I think I think we're all going to have to fight at RAGCon four.
00:15:18 So we're going to strengthen our bonds.
00:15:19 Mage versus the world.
00:15:21 I tell this for a while in the way that, yes,
00:15:24 it is more of like a female thing to not use violence.
00:15:27 But people are like generally scared of violence because you could get a medical
00:15:33 bill if you get hurt badly and it's like, oh, I don't want to be responsible
00:15:36 if I could go to jail.
00:15:38 But it's like it's turned like most men into like weak soy boy
00:15:43 pussies who don't do anything like they like not to make fun.
00:15:46 We are not immune from this.
00:15:48 We are just as guilty as we don't like not to like belittle women necessarily.
00:15:52 It is just like the other women are weak in the way that they don't fight.
00:15:57 But like fighting does like.
00:16:00 I don't know.
00:16:01 Is there's like a biological primal?
00:16:03 Yeah, there's a biological reason that like it's self preservation.
00:16:08 Like males used to fight for dominance, for attention,
00:16:11 whatever females have to preserve themselves because they bear children
00:16:15 and harm to them, harm to the whole, you know, species.
00:16:19 Yeah.
00:16:19 And it's like a lot of people.
00:16:22 Well, yeah, but like men, they they they they fight like that
00:16:26 and they communicate through physical violence and grandstanding
00:16:29 and being like, oh, look at me, I've got ripple dabs and giant penis.
00:16:33 And I'm really tall and I'm a snushew.
00:16:35 Yeah, yeah, we got to communicate so much back to the ancient Greeks.
00:16:39 We got to just strip naked and go into the arena.
00:16:41 But like, yeah, but what I'm getting at is like
00:16:45 men aren't as good at expressing emotions in other ways with with like speech.
00:16:51 It's like a lot of enemies, a lot of guys just, you know, fight it out
00:16:55 and then become best friends.
00:16:57 Yeah. Exactly. Yeah.
00:16:58 That speaks to something inherent in our brains.
00:17:01 And it's not like every man has to be like that.
00:17:03 But every man at the moment is like forced to be like that
00:17:06 because if you do anything, you're going to jail and nobody wants that.
00:17:10 So nobody ever works anything.
00:17:12 And it's like, I mean, fuck, you know what it is.
00:17:15 There's been a trend these days.
00:17:16 And this is a real fact that it's a real fact that these days
00:17:19 women do much better than men in like the school system.
00:17:23 Oh, and I was having at least a little conversation with a friend about this.
00:17:27 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
00:17:29 And like the reason that people bring up a lot, you know, this has been said a lot,
00:17:32 but that we we have sort of catered our educational system
00:17:38 to cater to girls because girls are more peaceful.
00:17:41 They are like more calm.
00:17:42 They learn model student, you know, and they say boys are treated as defective girls.
00:17:48 Yeah, I feel like I feel like you watch the same videos I did.
00:17:52 Probably. Probably. I've seen quite a few about this.
00:17:55 Well, I mean, like even like, you know, back in like the 80s and shit,
00:17:57 if you got into a fight in school, like the gym teacher would ref it
00:18:00 and then you just fucking hash it out.
00:18:02 And then when you're done, like you just parted ways.
00:18:04 Like, you know, you know what it is?
00:18:06 That's how shit used to get settled, man.
00:18:08 It's also that's the thing.
00:18:09 It's also the helicopter parents as well.
00:18:11 Like, you know, they don't want their kids to get hurt.
00:18:13 Right. Right.
00:18:14 That's exactly what I was going to say.
00:18:15 It's just it seems to me it's it's this it's a risk aversion
00:18:19 that I think is the is the main like driving factor here.
00:18:21 It's that, like, if you're like the baby boomer generation was a
00:18:25 generation that had like they had like a million siblings.
00:18:28 And that was still that was like right after World War Two.
00:18:32 And those guys were like, like the times hadn't changed it.
00:18:35 But with the baby boomer generation, with like all the civil rights
00:18:39 stuff happening and like the way the world's changing and everything's
00:18:41 becoming like safer and more like organized and neat.
00:18:43 I feel like the baby boomer generations because this is definitely
00:18:46 my experience with my parents.
00:18:47 My parents are maybe it's just the world like the way the media has changed
00:18:51 things, the way we were aware of so much stuff that's happened.
00:18:53 For example, like child like like kidnapping, you know, like rape,
00:18:58 molestation, all that stuff has plummeted.
00:19:01 And yet concerned from parents is that an all time high and and like
00:19:05 parents don't want their kids like it feels like it's bigger than ever
00:19:09 because we get more coverage for the small events that do happen.
00:19:12 Exactly. And just like in the same way that this gives us a blind spot
00:19:16 with stuff like that, like you'd be very safe, much safer than you've ever
00:19:19 been in history to let your kids play outside, even at a young age.
00:19:24 But like it we don't we don't perceive it that way.
00:19:27 Exactly because we hear more about the same things that does happen.
00:19:31 Like I said, like last episode, I was just like it's the last episode,
00:19:34 you know, when I was like six, five, six years old, and I was allowed
00:19:38 to go play alone in the neighborhood, even though, as I said, toxic dump.
00:19:43 Yeah, you said like the neighborhood was terrible with like lots of terrible people.
00:19:46 But, you know, I wasn't looked after.
00:19:49 But like nowadays, my sister has a child that's my nephew.
00:19:53 And she probably wouldn't let him go play without supervision,
00:19:57 even even though the neighborhood is very small and very easily monitored.
00:20:01 And the weird thing is, though, like if you if you are the one parent
00:20:04 who like breaks this trend and decides to let their kid run around outside
00:20:08 like in America, you get fucking arrested or like neglect or something.
00:20:11 It's the whole culture is shifting a huge way.
00:20:14 The thing it's the same as like as like, you know,
00:20:19 letting your kids like fall over and graze their knees or like bruise themselves
00:20:24 or and do all this sort of stuff.
00:20:26 You're supposed to let them, you know, catch colds and and run around in mud
00:20:31 occasionally, not all the time.
00:20:33 You're not supposed to encourage it.
00:20:34 But like if you let them make mistakes like that, they then learn by themselves
00:20:39 instead of being told and you can't go outside in the woods.
00:20:42 It's it's full of bugs and bugs are scary.
00:20:45 You are scared of bugs.
00:20:46 And then it like it it ends up with like, you know, people my age
00:20:51 are like, they're so sheltered that they like a bug.
00:20:55 I can't I can't deal.
00:20:57 I mean, I know people can't deal with bugs, but like so many people can't deal
00:21:00 with any bugs and in any capacity.
00:21:03 And I'm like, yeah, you are an adult and you are a hand for my friends with them.
00:21:08 It's like like we have a bunch of adults who are like need babying.
00:21:14 They they are a handful and I can't imagine like getting along with them.
00:21:19 Yeah. And you know what?
00:21:20 This reminds me, I think the real problem here is utopian thinking.
00:21:24 And it reminds me of like my current like favorite phrase in the world.
00:21:27 It's a popular one, but it's still my favorite.
00:21:29 It's the perfect is the enemy of the good.
00:21:32 And this is what like society, I think we would all agree would be better off
00:21:36 if we are a little bit less helicopter parenty over our kids.
00:21:40 But the thing is, though, if you are less helicopter parenty
00:21:45 and you are the one in a million parent who gets your child kidnapped
00:21:49 and like killed or whatever, then like even if on a utilitarian perspective
00:21:55 that the greater good has gained more than has been lost by this one child
00:22:00 who was just, you know, by freak coincidence happened to be the one
00:22:03 who was kidnapped and like destroyed and fucking destroyed in a game of Pokemon Smash.
00:22:09 Then, you know, like then you'll feel like, oh, no, like this was a huge mistake.
00:22:13 What I have done and it's a risk aversion.
00:22:15 That's why I keep saying it.
00:22:16 And like our perfect society, everyone wants like the utopia
00:22:20 where no one's ever hurt.
00:22:21 Everyone's perfect all the time.
00:22:23 We all grow up into perfect people and there's never any suffering.
00:22:26 But that's not real life.
00:22:28 Suffering is an inevitable, unescapable part of being a human.
00:22:32 I think we should we need to be exposed to it to toughen us the fuck up.
00:22:35 The thing is, though, a lot of these laws and enforcements of this sort of behavior
00:22:39 is because people look at like the worst case scenarios.
00:22:43 And if we are even more lenient than the people who are actually terrible
00:22:48 to their children and stuff would get away with it.
00:22:50 And that's what we're trying to prevent, but in doing so,
00:22:53 we're also enforcing the sort of helicopter parenting.
00:22:57 It's kind of sad because like if you if it's a group
00:23:00 we're trying to prepare kids for a perfect world, you know,
00:23:03 you want to give them that perfect world, you want to give them that perfect life.
00:23:06 And because you're sculpting them for this like kind of utopian life,
00:23:10 they're too free to deal with what actually is.
00:23:12 But if you prepare them for what actually is a world where like you're going to get hurt
00:23:16 and you're going to get fucked up, you're going to be better equipped to deal with the world.
00:23:19 And you will have a better life.
00:23:21 So like it's counterintuitive.
00:23:23 But like you got to like let your kids know that shit's not going to work out all the time.
00:23:27 You really do.
00:23:28 Like there's a there's a fantastic episode of Star Trek The Next Generation.
00:23:32 I can't remember the name of fans, one of the most famous.
00:23:34 But the premise is just that I know this is fiction,
00:23:37 but it's that Cap'n Picard gets to relive a moment in his life.
00:23:41 One of his defining moments where he he got stabbed through the heart.
00:23:44 And I mean, he got he was saved because they live in the future
00:23:46 and they had technology to save him.
00:23:48 But he got his fucking heart stabbed and he almost died.
00:23:51 And like he gets he goes back and he changes that history so that that never happened.
00:23:55 And what it made what it did to him was it made him like much more of a pussy
00:24:01 and like much less like he had never been exposed to that kind of danger and like overcome it.
00:24:06 So he just was more of a pussy.
00:24:07 And so he was like instead of being like a fucking badass captain that everyone loves,
00:24:11 a philosopher god king, he is like just some pussy researcher
00:24:15 who like he has a fine life, but it's nowhere near as like amazing
00:24:19 or as like beneficial to the world or the universe as like the Captain Picard
00:24:23 that did exist who went through this like it was a it was a dumb thing he did.
00:24:27 He like fought a guy in a bar.
00:24:29 He got fucking stabbed through the heart.
00:24:30 And like if he had lived in the past, he would have died.
00:24:32 But it's those experiences that made him like such a fucking badass.
00:24:36 And you know, like that's really just what we're talking about here.
00:24:40 And it reminds me that.
00:24:41 Oh yeah, go on, go on.
00:24:42 I'm absolutely convinced that if I grew up in a more like
00:24:47 not necessarily a violent world, but like a world that allowed expression
00:24:51 through physical stuff rather than speech,
00:24:53 I would like be a much more confident, you know, person in general.
00:24:57 Because as a shy boy, talking is always like my least favorite thing to do.
00:25:03 But like action wise, I'm always the sort of person who would like,
00:25:08 you know, if there's something that everybody notices,
00:25:10 but nobody wants to do anything about it because they're like,
00:25:14 I would be the one who just does the action to get things rolling.
00:25:17 Like at the airport just recently, there was like a big old,
00:25:20 when you go through security, you got all the trays and stuff,
00:25:23 and they keep piling up.
00:25:24 And I just like, I get involved and I want this thing to move,
00:25:30 not just for me, but for everyone.
00:25:32 I grab the empty trays and I stack them in the thing
00:25:35 so that everybody can move along.
00:25:37 And I'm just, I work it like, I do more through my actions
00:25:42 than I could ever do through my words, because I'm not a talkative person.
00:25:46 Doing podcasts has turned me into somewhat of a talkative person.
00:25:49 But in real life, I would just rather,
00:25:52 I would rather be like, I would rather not be able to talk.
00:25:56 You know, it's the sort of like, I'm so much more physical.
00:26:00 It doesn't come across at all in my YouTube work, obviously.
00:26:04 But like, I'm so much more physical than I am vocal.
00:26:08 And in a world where-
00:26:10 Ibsby's talk is let's get physical, the little facts.
00:26:13 But like, in a world where like, I could, you know,
00:26:18 if a bully was fucking roughing me up and I couldn't like,
00:26:23 there was no system in place to tell him off.
00:26:25 Or like, if it wasn't scary for the bully to try and attack me
00:26:28 because he doesn't want to get detention.
00:26:29 I mean, obviously you would get in trouble if you try to fight someone.
00:26:32 But like, there was never any like, proper fighting
00:26:37 or like, resolving of conflict.
00:26:39 It was all sort of, you know, people yelling at me.
00:26:41 And I'm like, I don't want to yell back because I don't do that.
00:26:44 I would rather they punch me so that I can know for sure.
00:26:48 How they feel about me so that I can punch them.
00:26:50 And I'm like, I wouldn't love that.
00:26:51 But I never had any opportunity like that to like-
00:26:55 For you, for you, the ideal world would be to be like that manga called Gone.
00:27:01 Are you familiar with that one?
00:27:02 Yeah, the guy.
00:27:04 It has no words.
00:27:05 And you're just a badass little dinosaur guy,
00:27:07 just like going about world, kicking ass and just being cool.
00:27:11 I mean, yeah, it's, I'm sure like a lot of shy boys love Shonen
00:27:15 for this escapist fantasy of-
00:27:17 Doing violence to do, you know, to do anything.
00:27:22 For me, it's a little difficult to really say either way,
00:27:27 because like, for my story, as you could tell,
00:27:29 I was a very extroverted, very sort of fight person.
00:27:32 Mange did fight people.
00:27:33 She didn't fuck around.
00:27:36 I was very extroverted.
00:27:37 Like I said, I greeted strangers.
00:27:39 I fought with people when I needed to.
00:27:41 I wasn't afraid of anything.
00:27:43 But then I got a bully.
00:27:46 And the thing is, up until that point,
00:27:49 all my fights were more or less fair.
00:27:51 It's usually one-on-one.
00:27:53 Someone else maybe was watching, maybe not.
00:27:57 It's just, it's, you know, it felt fair, winner-lose.
00:28:02 But with this bully, she always, she was, I think, my age,
00:28:08 but she looked older due to makeup and clothes and stuff.
00:28:12 And she always hung around with guys much older than her.
00:28:15 Like, I was like 13 or so when I first met her,
00:28:18 but the guys hanging around with her were like 18 or so, probably.
00:28:22 Okay.
00:28:23 Much taller, much bigger.
00:28:24 Was she fucking, was she fucking them?
00:28:25 I'm just curious.
00:28:26 I don't know, but she probably was,
00:28:28 because why else would they hang around with her?
00:28:31 That's true.
00:28:32 No, but seriously.
00:28:33 My fellow big towels, hell yeah.
00:28:36 Again, it's a little hard to talk about this,
00:28:40 because it was very defining.
00:28:42 Hard in my life.
00:28:42 But yeah, she, it was never a fair fight.
00:28:45 She always had them around and she mentally harassed me,
00:28:50 I guess, verbally abused me before fighting.
00:28:54 But the thing is, I didn't have a chance to necessarily fight back.
00:28:58 I did try once, but that didn't end well.
00:29:02 And I was scared because those guys were around,
00:29:04 and even if I were to defeat her, you know, they're gonna beat me up.
00:29:09 And she was never alone.
00:29:10 And the thing is, she was-
00:29:11 Well, my guess is that, I'm guessing those guys never actually beat you up,
00:29:14 but it was that the threat was there.
00:29:16 Yeah, well, I was a little kid, I didn't know.
00:29:18 And I fought with guys before, I never really had the mentality,
00:29:22 oh, they're not gonna beat me up just because I'm a girl.
00:29:25 You know, I fought with everyone who would fight.
00:29:30 So yeah, and the thing is, she wasn't in my school,
00:29:32 she wasn't in my neighborhood.
00:29:33 She was kind of like the neighborhoods,
00:29:35 well, not even the neighborhoods, the town's boogeyman for me.
00:29:38 I didn't know where she would pop up, but if she did,
00:29:42 and if I was alone, I'm screwed.
00:29:44 And even if I was with a friend,
00:29:45 I couldn't really trust my friends to help me out because the first,
00:29:49 maybe I think the first and second time I met with her,
00:29:51 I was with a friend, the same one as well.
00:29:53 She wasn't really helpful, let's say.
00:29:58 And because of her, because of the unfairness and injustice,
00:30:02 I became very reclusive and shy.
00:30:05 And I think because of her, in a way,
00:30:08 because of the whole situation started just avoiding outside
00:30:12 and started being scared of people, strangers mostly,
00:30:15 I became very self-conscious, just fearing people.
00:30:20 And now I became the weenie I am today.
00:30:24 That's very interesting.
00:30:26 I mean, I can totally see why it would lead to that.
00:30:29 I mean, for me, my experience was definitely more like Gibbs.
00:30:32 I mean, I think it is an interesting phenomenon.
00:30:36 You know, they say that, what's the generation after millennials?
00:30:38 Gen Z, is that what they call them, right?
00:30:40 I have no idea.
00:30:40 Is that the right one?
00:30:41 The last one, the last generation before we all care.
00:30:43 The munchies, the Christ consciousness generation.
00:30:47 Yeah, whatever it is, whatever it is they call it.
00:30:49 The post jobs, the one after millennials.
00:30:52 They say that that generation is much more conservative.
00:30:55 That's what they say.
00:30:56 And I think I know why.
00:30:58 I think that, in America, the political landscape is divided
00:31:03 in such a way that the Democratic party just owns a set of ideas,
00:31:09 the liberal side of things, and then the more conservative,
00:31:11 including the Republicans, I guess the libertarians,
00:31:13 and that sort of group, that encompasses a different batch of ideals.
00:31:19 And going back to, so there was the greatest generation
00:31:23 who fought in World War II, then there was the baby boomers
00:31:26 who were their kids, our parents.
00:31:28 And the baby boomers were the free love movement
00:31:31 in response to their hard ass World War II fighting parents
00:31:34 who were the most badass people ever.
00:31:36 And so our parents, they rebelled against that.
00:31:41 And they felt like, no man, it's all about freedom
00:31:45 and treating people great and everyone being equal.
00:31:48 And everyone's a winner, everyone gets a gold sticker.
00:31:51 Exactly, because their parents were such hard asses
00:31:53 in the changing world of all this new technology,
00:31:57 and radio, well radio had been a while,
00:31:59 but all this new stuff that was happening.
00:32:01 And then our generation is the children,
00:32:03 the millennials, the children of those baby boomers.
00:32:06 And so most millennials were coddled, without a doubt.
00:32:10 We're the coddled ones who were raised by,
00:32:14 are caring and protective parents.
00:32:16 Yeah, and it's not just a normal generation switch
00:32:21 where you rebel against the previous generation
00:32:24 because it's just how it is.
00:32:25 But with the internet coming in and connecting the world,
00:32:29 it's sort of combined with people being soft.
00:32:33 It just sort of made it so that there was no way to become tough.
00:32:39 That's true.
00:32:40 Because you could hide it at home,
00:32:41 and laws will pass when people bruise their knees
00:32:45 or cut themselves on a piece of glass.
00:32:46 Like no more glass in the city, like what are you talking about?
00:32:49 Like all these weird things are coming up.
00:32:51 And it's like, if we had the capacity to rebel
00:32:55 against our soft parents, we would have.
00:32:58 But we just got sort of trapped.
00:32:59 Your kids, you can't do shit.
00:33:01 All you can do is become an adult.
00:33:02 All you can do is just sort of put on a balaclava
00:33:05 and say, Antifa, and be a big old crazy,
00:33:09 throwing rocks, molotov cocktails.
00:33:11 But like, there's so much police, they're so big.
00:33:14 They got truncheons and guns.
00:33:16 What are you going to do about it?
00:33:17 The problem is that we get involved.
00:33:18 They're going to slice us in half,
00:33:20 and we're going to die.
00:33:21 To me, the problem is seriously
00:33:22 that we've involved the government
00:33:23 in so much of what should just be private interactions.
00:33:27 Yeah, like small towns are now, you know, worldwide.
00:33:31 The whole state, it's fucking crazy.
00:33:32 Yeah, and it's kind of just a natural consequence
00:33:35 of globalization and just the increased reach
00:33:38 of through fucking telecommunications.
00:33:39 It's just a psychological reaction to the fact
00:33:41 that we're so hyper aware of all the minutiae of bad
00:33:46 that it feels like it's on our doorstep,
00:33:47 even if it's half a world away.
00:33:49 That's for sure.
00:33:50 But I think that the Generation Z,
00:33:52 or whatever it is, after the millennials,
00:33:53 those guys, and the reason they're conservative,
00:33:55 or getting more conservative, I think, is because-
00:33:57 The parents are all pussies and they hate it.
00:33:59 Yeah, they are the reactionary generation
00:34:02 who have recognized the damage that's been done by-
00:34:05 Mom, why are you so goddamn gay?
00:34:08 Yeah, why are you so gay, mom?
00:34:09 What the hell?
00:34:11 Mom and mom.
00:34:12 Like, it's just that, and it's that the right owns,
00:34:15 like the right just owns the ideas of freedom.
00:34:19 And the ideas of personal responsibility.
00:34:21 Those are just ideas that belong to the right in America.
00:34:25 And because of that, the whole generation
00:34:27 has been pulled in that direction.
00:34:29 And you see that with the whole, like, I don't know,
00:34:31 like the whole anti-feminists on YouTube and the-
00:34:33 How did this get political?
00:34:34 Or are we just gonna have to talk about fighting?
00:34:36 Well, it's all real.
00:34:37 I mean, fighting is quite-
00:34:38 I'm just talking about generational issues.
00:34:40 Politics is all about fighting,
00:34:41 but it's like the most boring kind with outlets.
00:34:44 But speaking of politics being fighting.
00:34:46 I've been in so many fights, dude.
00:34:48 I like Quarter Circle and Hadouken, so I'm the best fighter.
00:34:52 It's fucking sick.
00:34:53 I was gonna say, that's a good one too,
00:34:55 but speaking of political being a fight,
00:34:57 let's talk about like verbal online badass,
00:35:00 you know, urban warfare on Twitter fighting.
00:35:03 Before we do that, I wanna say a very quick story,
00:35:07 because I didn't get to talk much about my fighting days this episode.
00:35:12 A fun thing that happened that I had completely forgot,
00:35:15 but I remembered for this episode,
00:35:17 that used to happen is like,
00:35:18 my neighborhood would have fights with another neighborhood.
00:35:21 So it was kind of like-
00:35:23 Gang warfare!
00:35:24 The cop killers versus the rowdies!
00:35:26 The violent violence and her gang going against the fucking interlopers.
00:35:30 No, no, I was-
00:35:31 The indigo interlopers.
00:35:35 Violent violence versus the indigo interlopers.
00:35:37 The war of purple, which hue is best?
00:35:39 Fan art now, get on it.
00:35:42 Young mage with a fucking spiked baseball.
00:35:44 The fucking magenta mobsters.
00:35:49 Was there a leader of the opposition, mage?
00:35:51 Your indigo parallel?
00:35:53 I wasn't even the leader, guys.
00:35:56 I don't believe you.
00:35:57 No, revisionist history, you were definitely the leader.
00:35:59 Continue, please.
00:36:00 I'm sorry, mage, please.
00:36:01 I never really met the leader.
00:36:04 I saw, you know, I think our neighborhood won,
00:36:06 just because of the-
00:36:07 Who a shadowy figure.
00:36:08 The neighbors, because numbers, we had the numbers on our side.
00:36:13 The neighborhood was a lot smaller than ours,
00:36:16 so, you know, we had more people.
00:36:18 We still had fun with the fights.
00:36:21 I barely got to participate, because I didn't won.
00:36:24 I was still, I think, six or seven when they were going around.
00:36:29 The fights were mostly between teenagers, like 14 and up,
00:36:33 so I only got to participate in a few of them.
00:36:36 What kind of fights?
00:36:37 Are we talking weapons or just fist fights?
00:36:39 It was like, now I have to, like, dig back in my memories.
00:36:43 How was it?
00:36:45 Broken bottles.
00:36:46 They're just like, literally, shooting each other.
00:36:48 Just fucking gunfights.
00:36:50 Oh, wait, when the craze happened with the, like,
00:36:53 the, what do you call, those P-shooters or something,
00:36:56 those guns?
00:36:57 Like a BB gun or something?
00:36:58 Yeah, I didn't own those, so I didn't participate in those.
00:37:00 Those happened later.
00:37:01 But they used BB guns against each other?
00:37:03 Yeah, they used BBs.
00:37:04 Dude, this is sick.
00:37:06 That's pretty serious, all right.
00:37:08 The age was literally in a shonen anime.
00:37:10 This is insane.
00:37:11 But before that, but before that, I remember, like,
00:37:15 I was part in one where we were, like, devised a plan.
00:37:18 It was like, okay, guys, you take this route
00:37:20 and you guys take this route and we're going to surround them
00:37:23 and we're just going to beat the shit out of them.
00:37:25 And like, oh, they have, like, people watching over there,
00:37:27 so be careful, they'll see you coming.
00:37:29 Kind of striking for real life.
00:37:31 So this is, like, a lot of tactics for, like, little kids.
00:37:33 Yeah, and it's like, ah, we'll lead them
00:37:35 into our neighborhood's old Soviet minefield,
00:37:37 and we'll have them in there.
00:37:40 The closest my life ever came to stuff like that
00:37:43 was, like, snowball fights, which is lame.
00:37:46 I mean, it's kind of cool.
00:37:47 We're talking about how millennials
00:37:48 are all fucking pussies, but Mage over here,
00:37:50 six years old, was drafted into a conflict.
00:37:55 Child soldiers.
00:37:56 She's the real child soldier.
00:37:58 Fuck, Munchy, it's Mage.
00:37:59 It's fucking Mage.
00:38:00 We're not giving Mage enough credit.
00:38:02 The violent violence is fucking on the prowl.
00:38:05 You know, I just, when I was young,
00:38:07 like, the closest thing I had to anything like that
00:38:09 was when I was at summer camp,
00:38:11 I know I told the story last time,
00:38:12 but, like, my mom would roll up
00:38:14 and she'd find me, like, with, like, dual-wielding sticks
00:38:17 and, like, having pine cones in my belt as grenades
00:38:19 and, like, ready to fucking kill.
00:38:21 I, like, I don't know what we would do.
00:38:22 We would divide up into teams,
00:38:24 and this is at the YMCA summer camp in the woods.
00:38:25 It was fucking sick.
00:38:26 This is instantly less impressive than Mage's.
00:38:29 I know, I know.
00:38:30 Like, we didn't even really fight.
00:38:31 We just, like, got geared up and then just, like, felt cool.
00:38:34 Like, that's what we did.
00:38:36 Well, that sounds like the American equivalent
00:38:39 of fucking war-torn Lithuania.
00:38:41 Who wants to hear a story of how I got banished
00:38:43 from my own neighborhood?
00:38:45 Oh, I do.
00:38:47 How did that, how is this possible?
00:38:48 Okay, so...
00:38:50 Their own leader.
00:38:51 My neighborhood.
00:38:52 I wasn't the leader, oh my god.
00:38:55 That's what you say now.
00:38:56 My neighborhood got together to, like,
00:38:59 build a little base for, for itself,
00:39:01 like, a little house or whatever,
00:39:03 and they were building nearby my house,
00:39:06 because there was a really good spot,
00:39:08 and it was sort of like, it wasn't necessarily...
00:39:10 When you say neighborhood,
00:39:12 do you mean, like, all the kids and teenagers from around?
00:39:16 Yeah, it's like...
00:39:17 Just like...
00:39:18 I can't really describe it.
00:39:20 It's like, I live in this area that's like, it's sort of like...
00:39:24 There's a group of houses,
00:39:29 and they're kind of surrounded by streets,
00:39:33 or like, the city centers, or stuff like that,
00:39:36 and like, it has its own little area
00:39:40 that's kind of disconnected from other areas,
00:39:42 so I call that the neighborhood.
00:39:44 It wasn't like, you know, blocks or whatever.
00:39:46 Yeah.
00:39:47 It's a little hard to describe.
00:39:48 Oh, so like a cul-de-sac or something?
00:39:49 Is it like, like a road,
00:39:51 like one road that goes in and out?
00:39:52 Road street, home.
00:39:55 I guess kind of, it could maybe something like that.
00:39:59 It's, I mean, whatever I can describe...
00:40:00 A similarly kind of like...
00:40:02 Okay.
00:40:02 I don't think it's anything equivalent to American layout of houses or whatever.
00:40:08 Okay, that's fine, but how did you get banished?
00:40:09 I need to know.
00:40:10 Yeah, so yeah, so they came off the group project
00:40:13 for that little base and stuff,
00:40:14 and they were building near my house, near to my house,
00:40:19 and the thing is, I was really excited about it,
00:40:22 because, you know, I was sort of part of it,
00:40:23 and I was, you know, very excited.
00:40:25 Oh, hey, a base.
00:40:26 It's neat.
00:40:27 And the problem was, though, they were making a lot of noise,
00:40:30 so I think it was my parents or someone living above,
00:40:35 like, somewhere from my house,
00:40:37 because we didn't own a house,
00:40:38 we were living in an apartment,
00:40:39 and they were like, you know, sort of,
00:40:41 somewhere from that area,
00:40:42 complained and had all the progress sort of like,
00:40:48 told them to take it down,
00:40:50 but then like, for some reason,
00:40:53 the neighborhood kids, some of them,
00:40:54 got this idea that I was responsible for it,
00:40:57 like, I complained to my parents or something.
00:40:59 Oh, they thought you were a rat.
00:41:00 Yeah, they, yeah, and they blamed me.
00:41:03 An adult informant.
00:41:04 And they blamed me for it,
00:41:05 even though I was super excited about the whole project,
00:41:08 and they were like, you're not allowed to like,
00:41:10 go into the neighborhood for a month,
00:41:12 and if we see you, we're gonna beat you up.
00:41:14 And also, oh, Jesus, all right.
00:41:16 So I had to sneak around to go see my friends and stuff.
00:41:20 So you still went, you risked it all?
00:41:23 I wouldn't mind fighting the younger kids,
00:41:25 but like, the teenagers were a bit tougher,
00:41:27 especially since they never went around alone.
00:41:29 Fucking, now this is Metal Gear solo.
00:41:31 This is still famous, well.
00:41:33 This is like the main character gets fucking ostracized arc
00:41:38 of like a shonen manga,
00:41:39 where it's just him against the world for a while.
00:41:41 Mage is going through all the motions.
00:41:43 Mage, you should definitely make a manga about your life.
00:41:47 My life is a great idea.
00:41:48 It wasn't even all that exciting.
00:41:51 But you made it exciting for the narrative.
00:41:53 Yeah.
00:41:53 Mage, right now you're just like hiding,
00:41:55 you're in hiding just like being like the hermit weeaboo.
00:42:00 We're in the middle of a time skip.
00:42:02 So in like two or three years,
00:42:03 the time skip's gonna end,
00:42:04 and like you're gonna come out of hiding
00:42:06 more powerful than you ever were.
00:42:07 Mage knows, the Geneva boys, the fucking UN,
00:42:11 will convict her for crimes against humanity
00:42:13 if they find out that the leader of the violent violets
00:42:15 is in fact still alive and not dead.
00:42:18 Like, you know, as the Osama bin Laden ally
00:42:20 that she is in real life, you know, don't,
00:42:23 so she's gotta lay low, gotta lay low.
00:42:26 Yeah, I'm picturing you as solid snake violets
00:42:29 on top of Metal Gear Rex, shirtless, bare knuckle boxing,
00:42:34 like a snake, you know, who's the indigo,
00:42:38 what is it, ingrate, the indigo ingrate,
00:42:40 that's what his name is, that's what I'm calling him.
00:42:42 Beautiful.
00:42:42 Just like this,
00:42:43 Mage with this long flowing purple bandana,
00:42:46 the exact hesitalism of value we need.
00:42:48 Okay, so since we're really, like,
00:42:51 since you guys seem to like this narrative,
00:42:53 I'll tell you one more thing.
00:42:55 From the opposing, like, the neighborhood guys, people,
00:43:00 this was before I went to school,
00:43:02 and so when I started going to school,
00:43:06 I had this classmate and I had a crush on him
00:43:09 and it turns out he was from the opposing neighborhood.
00:43:13 Oh, my head hits all the beats!
00:43:15 Fuck!
00:43:17 Dude, how did it go?
00:43:18 What happened?
00:43:19 He didn't go well, he liked to-
00:43:20 You had to kill him in the end.
00:43:21 No, he had to murder her.
00:43:23 I actually confessed to him that he liked another girl
00:43:26 in the class that everyone liked, so-
00:43:28 Oh, but you knitted out-
00:43:29 Disgusting.
00:43:29 So he had to die.
00:43:30 No, I'm just joking.
00:43:33 Now he's dead.
00:43:34 Hell yes, that's fucking awesome.
00:43:37 Incredible, incredible.
00:43:38 Fucking, the rat is in cop killers embarrassing,
00:43:40 not even real.
00:43:41 No.
00:43:41 The violets and the indigos.
00:43:43 Clearly not even, like, we have a whole
00:43:45 untapped potential lore over here
00:43:47 that we've never even touched on.
00:43:49 It's true.
00:43:49 We need a dramatic retelling
00:43:51 of your entire childhood mage.
00:43:53 I want a graphic novel on my desk on Monday,
00:43:56 monochromatic purple, start to finish, go.
00:44:00 Yeah, you should re-tool the bot that's in your Discord
00:44:04 to make it turn it into, like, Endless War 2,
00:44:07 but, like, purple version.
00:44:08 Yes.
00:44:10 No.
00:44:11 The Violet Violets.
00:44:12 I don't like fighting anymore, though.
00:44:15 That's so sad.
00:44:16 You need to be reawakened.
00:44:17 Like, you're, like, basically,
00:44:19 literally Unohana from Bleach,
00:44:20 which I think is what you said last time.
00:44:22 I know, I know.
00:44:23 But that's pretty much exactly it.
00:44:24 You just need to reawaken your bloodlust.
00:44:26 No, I was gonna say, I was gonna say,
00:44:28 she's more like Simone right now,
00:44:29 because she's had a traumatic experience
00:44:31 that has made her sheltered.
00:44:32 She needs someone to come along
00:44:33 and reawaken her vigor for life.
00:44:35 Fair enough, fair enough.
00:44:36 Hey, I like drawing.
00:44:39 Yeah, just like Simone,
00:44:41 like staying in his room and sculpting communes.
00:44:43 But we all know Mage,
00:44:45 because the things you draw
00:44:46 are always, like, super creepy and bloody.
00:44:48 We know what's really down deep inside.
00:44:50 There's a killer that lives.
00:44:51 You just need some super sexy anime chick
00:44:53 to come into your life and, like,
00:44:56 worship you, and you'll feel so much better.
00:44:58 She needs a commune.
00:44:59 A new commune.
00:45:01 Commune 2, aka Nia.
00:45:02 All right, anyway, hey, hey.
00:45:03 Let's talk about fighting on the Internet
00:45:06 with people who give you shit.
00:45:07 No, it's lame.
00:45:08 No, that's good.
00:45:09 But that's how most fighting is done in the world.
00:45:10 Can we talk about how that is not real fighting
00:45:13 and it is gay and it's stupid?
00:45:14 Okay.
00:45:15 I want to say before we go on to that,
00:45:16 just one little thing.
00:45:18 Sure.
00:45:19 I went to, like, I forgot to say this.
00:45:21 I went to Taekwondo practice once,
00:45:23 and I thought it was really lame.
00:45:25 And I realized then that I don't care
00:45:27 about, like, being able to fight.
00:45:29 I just like being in danger.
00:45:31 It's so cool to be in a dangerous situation,
00:45:34 like, to do something you're not allowed to do,
00:45:36 to jump over a fence, to get a ball,
00:45:38 when there's the possibility of a CCT camera getting you.
00:45:41 And then you're getting put in jail,
00:45:43 and when you're a little kid,
00:45:44 that's what you think can happen.
00:45:45 Yeah, doesn't that mean you thrive in our current society?
00:45:47 Because literally everything has a risk of punishment now,
00:45:50 because everything's stated off.
00:45:50 Yeah, I mean, well, I mean, not really.
00:45:52 But, like, when I was young, and I thought,
00:45:54 I would go, like, there was this time a ball
00:45:56 went over the school fence, and I was like,
00:46:00 it was after school, and the school was closed.
00:46:04 And I jumped over it, even though I knew
00:46:07 that there was a camera there,
00:46:08 and that I could get in trouble next day.
00:46:10 And nothing happened.
00:46:11 But I was like, nobody's going to get this ball.
00:46:13 Everyone's scared.
00:46:14 But I'm the guy who would, like, silently do the cool thing.
00:46:18 And then everybody would be like, whoa.
00:46:21 That's why talking sucks.
00:46:23 I like jumping over fences and punching people.
00:46:26 I want to be a fucking gremlin.
00:46:27 I want to be a fucking real-life gremlin man.
00:46:31 And I'm not allowed to, and it sucks.
00:46:34 Speaking of Taekwondo, going to a practice and sucking,
00:46:38 it's definitely true that martial arts is so much
00:46:41 about the fundamentals that do not look cool.
00:46:43 And fighting really, even the coolest UFC matches,
00:46:47 look pretty basic and not anime, which is unfortunate.
00:46:51 But I've been watching a lot of Joe Rogan's podcast
00:46:54 for the last, I don't know, a couple years at this point.
00:46:55 And he's obviously a fighter, a trained fighter,
00:46:59 and he still has UFC people on all the time,
00:47:02 because that's one of his jobs to commentate or whatever.
00:47:04 And it's given me an appreciation.
00:47:05 I haven't watched any of the fights,
00:47:07 other than the really big ones,
00:47:09 of CM Punk getting his ass handed to him several times
00:47:12 at this point.
00:47:14 But it's just cool to hear an expert like him talk about it.
00:47:18 And just on a technical level,
00:47:19 to describe getting people into fancy holds and arm bars
00:47:24 and get their fucking neck in a chokehold or some shit,
00:47:27 it's cool.
00:47:28 And I'm sure for the people watching,
00:47:30 it doesn't look that cool to just watch two people like Bob
00:47:33 and weave and throw out a jab and then run away.
00:47:36 But that's just how a soccer game doesn't look cool
00:47:39 until they get a goal.
00:47:40 But once you understand it more,
00:47:42 you get that every little thing is part of a grand plan
00:47:46 to conserve energy.
00:47:47 Only you expend as much as you need.
00:47:49 I watch so much anime that when I watch UFC,
00:47:51 it eventually just turns to a ground game.
00:47:53 And it's two guys in swim trunks fucking each other.
00:47:56 And it's just too gay for you.
00:47:59 It's just like gay porn and not fighting.
00:48:04 I'm sure all the coolest things I've ever thought I've done
00:48:07 looked terrible and really cringy.
00:48:10 But the feeling of doing them was the main thing.
00:48:12 The feeling of other men's ballsack against my face.
00:48:16 The highest form of art is the male form.
00:48:20 So did you all try to take martial art classes?
00:48:25 I went for a while.
00:48:26 I went to a Taekwondo class
00:48:29 and I just didn't like it immediately.
00:48:33 That's not bad, Tom.
00:48:34 That's cool, Tom.
00:48:36 I only went to one class.
00:48:37 I don't even remember which martial art it was.
00:48:39 It was in the sort of gym.
00:48:42 So there were a lot of other activities
00:48:43 that other people were doing.
00:48:44 I didn't like my class.
00:48:45 So I just kind of pissed off to go lift weights.
00:48:49 Because I like lift weights.
00:48:51 So I've done that.
00:48:52 That's what I've done.
00:48:53 Yeah.
00:48:53 It's a lot easier.
00:48:54 If someone's going to kill me, then what am I going to do?
00:48:58 All you need is a gun and any amount
00:49:00 of martial arts training I've got.
00:49:01 I mean, yes, you could be smart
00:49:03 and maybe just harm them or something.
00:49:05 My dad's like a trained fighter.
00:49:07 He knows all this crazy shit.
00:49:09 And he's just like, martial arts is great.
00:49:12 But at the end of the day, you really
00:49:13 have to know how to like a street fight is totally different.
00:49:16 And all the forms and condoms and shit you learn
00:49:18 don't really mean things.
00:49:19 You have to know how to fight for real.
00:49:21 Sure.
00:49:21 The fact that policemen can fail to stop a guy
00:49:26 from getting them, even though they have a gun,
00:49:28 is just sort of like, even if they're trained in martial
00:49:31 arts or hand-to-hand, something or other.
00:49:33 Policemen have very low standards for physical combat,
00:49:36 which is why they go straight to the gun every time,
00:49:38 which is unfortunate.
00:49:38 Maybe in America.
00:49:39 I don't know how it is.
00:49:40 Yeah, OK.
00:49:41 I mean, in America, we have lots of guns,
00:49:43 so it's different from, you know.
00:49:44 Yeah, there's no guns in the UK except for special types
00:49:47 of policemen who are allowed to have them.
00:49:49 Really?
00:49:49 So even your normal policemen don't
00:49:51 have, normally, don't have guns?
00:49:53 I think they have like stun things and batons and whatever.
00:49:56 OK, we have a baton.
00:49:57 But like, pathetic.
00:49:59 And, but like, they're trained to use the hands
00:50:02 and to say, stop, or stop doing that really loud.
00:50:05 I mean, that's how it should be, you'd think.
00:50:08 Yeah, yeah.
00:50:09 Do you think?
00:50:10 I don't, I don't want to say something.
00:50:10 Well, I mean, OK.
00:50:12 I shouldn't have said this.
00:50:13 OK, if you're like robbing a thing.
00:50:14 I retract my statement.
00:50:15 You're right.
00:50:15 Let's move on.
00:50:17 OK, fine, fine, fine.
00:50:19 Yo, Twitter is lame.
00:50:21 Twitter is dumb.
00:50:23 Everything that happens on there is a waste of time
00:50:25 and a problem.
00:50:26 Do you want, do you want to know why Twitter is a problem?
00:50:29 Why it's gay and why it's dumb?
00:50:30 It's because all of us have this urge
00:50:33 to settle our conflicts physically and we can't.
00:50:35 So this is how we get it out of our system,
00:50:37 inefficiently and pathetically.
00:50:40 You know, I definitely agree with that.
00:50:41 But and I was also going to say that I don't think Twitter,
00:50:44 like when you're man to man with someone,
00:50:46 you're a face to fucking face.
00:50:47 And you've got a grievance.
00:50:49 Like all I'm going to say is that like it's so different
00:50:52 than like tweeting with somebody back and forth.
00:50:54 There is a threat of physical violence.
00:50:57 Yeah, there's no threat of physical repercussions on Twitter.
00:50:59 You can say whatever you want.
00:51:00 And it's because of this.
00:51:00 If you go have your coffee and nobody gives a shit.
00:51:02 Because Twitter is so immediately,
00:51:04 Twitter is consequence free.
00:51:06 Things can really snowball
00:51:08 and like they can get way out of proportion
00:51:10 and especially because the fucking media and like I get why.
00:51:13 But people take tweets as like gospel
00:51:16 and they like if you use a word on Twitter,
00:51:18 that's offensive or whatever, like, I don't know, faggot,
00:51:21 then like, oh, well now you are officially a homophobe
00:51:24 because you use the word faggot on Twitter.
00:51:27 And like maybe you are a homophobe.
00:51:29 Maybe you're not.
00:51:30 But like the Twitter shouldn't be the arbiter
00:51:32 of whether you are or not.
00:51:33 You know, I agree.
00:51:34 And like I hate that we use Twitter as like a,
00:51:37 it's like the official, it's like we treat someone's Twitter.
00:51:39 The same as we treat like a published book they've written.
00:51:42 They're like equally valid a representation
00:51:44 of like the arguments of this person.
00:51:46 You know what it is?
00:51:46 It's like being a homophobe is only like,
00:51:51 I mean, I don't think being a homophobe is illegal at all.
00:51:54 So like the only thing that people have
00:51:56 to like leverage that like, oh, I don't like homophobes.
00:52:01 Like what are they, what can they do?
00:52:03 They can't punch you because everyone's a fucking pussy on Twitter.
00:52:06 Nobody's gonna actually beat you up.
00:52:08 The actions are illegal, but the stance,
00:52:10 the personal thoughts in your head so far
00:52:13 have yet to become illegal.
00:52:15 So far, so far.
00:52:16 There's a lot of thought policing been going on.
00:52:19 But yeah, but like since people can't like,
00:52:22 if somebody says yes, I think because I'm, you know, maybe,
00:52:26 I'm a Christian and I think gay people are wrong.
00:52:29 Like that guy, everybody know, like he's saying it outright
00:52:32 and people are like, oh, I hate that guy.
00:52:33 He's a homophobe.
00:52:34 What can I do to fuck with him?
00:52:36 I can't punch him.
00:52:37 I can't like physically do anything.
00:52:39 You fucking don't shop at his place.
00:52:40 That's what you do.
00:52:41 Well, you know, yes, that, of course,
00:52:45 but like people don't do that.
00:52:46 They sit on Twitter and try to ruin people's lives in other ways.
00:52:50 Yeah.
00:52:50 Well, like, for example, like that guy,
00:52:51 because they have, they have, they have like, you know,
00:52:55 an urge to fight, but they have no way to actually relieve the stress.
00:52:59 Right.
00:52:59 So your first, your first reaction in your body
00:53:02 is to physically lash out when you see something that embrages you.
00:53:05 Like how many times have you got a really retarded comment
00:53:07 and the first, your first reaction is like,
00:53:09 I just want to lay this person out.
00:53:11 That's just, it's biologically ingrained in us.
00:53:13 I mean, that's, that's true.
00:53:14 Just want to punch shit, dude.
00:53:16 We have to appear to our better angels and recognize
00:53:18 that like when you get a really mean comment,
00:53:20 it's more than likely this person was at their worst
00:53:23 when they wrote that comment.
00:53:24 And, you know, I mean, it's just to your benefit
00:53:27 to try not to flip out.
00:53:28 You know what I mean.
00:53:29 But what I am, what I was getting at is that people,
00:53:33 they, they, they're lobbying, no, not lobbying,
00:53:37 I don't know the word, but like they're trying to get
00:53:39 like more and more restrictions put on what people can say.
00:53:42 So that they're making things more and more illegal,
00:53:46 you know, for like less and less things.
00:53:46 Because people think the fucking government
00:53:48 should dictate personal interaction
00:53:50 instead of just like, if you don't like a guy,
00:53:52 don't shop at his place.
00:53:53 They want, they want to be able to ruin this person's life
00:53:56 for doing this thing that makes them upset
00:53:58 because they can't fight them.
00:54:00 So they have to make it illegal somehow.
00:54:01 But of course, the tool that put, yeah.
00:54:04 The, you know, the, the more it is just,
00:54:08 it just leads to like, where does the line get drawn
00:54:11 for like what a person can be.
00:54:12 And that's the problem.
00:54:13 Because these people go and jail at birth.
00:54:16 Yeah. And like, when you, when you make a speech,
00:54:19 like fucking criminalized or whatever, like, okay,
00:54:22 we've outlawed saying like, you know, racist stuff.
00:54:25 So like, you can't say that like, I hate all, you know, Hispanics.
00:54:28 Like that, that is like racist or something.
00:54:31 Okay. But apparently it is legally acceptable
00:54:34 to say like, I hate all white people.
00:54:36 And it's like, okay, let now logically speaking,
00:54:38 that doesn't make sense why you can do that.
00:54:41 But it seems to be sort of, it's just like, okay,
00:54:43 if the government institutes a policy where like,
00:54:45 you can't discriminate based on race
00:54:46 to stop people from being racist or Hispanics,
00:54:48 then like, let's assume a right wing government
00:54:50 takes over later.
00:54:51 Well, now you've given them the ability,
00:54:53 especially if you ignore that previous thing about like,
00:54:56 you didn't criminalize when people said that,
00:54:58 you know, like white people are all bad or whatever.
00:55:00 Like now you've put a system in place where like,
00:55:03 the attorney or whatever, the district attorney or whatever,
00:55:06 can like, choose to now we can criminalize people
00:55:08 who say they hate all white people.
00:55:10 And let's just let off people who say they hate all Hispanics.
00:55:12 Like the problem is that we put any of these rules into place.
00:55:16 You just need to let people sort out amongst themselves.
00:55:18 And that's exactly what the Supreme Court itself said
00:55:21 when they just fucking put that decision down.
00:55:23 And they said that that guy who didn't,
00:55:25 that serious Christian,
00:55:26 who didn't want to make that wedding cake
00:55:28 for the gay couple or whatever,
00:55:29 they could not compel the him to make that cake.
00:55:32 And damn right.
00:55:33 Cause fuck though, that would be such a fucked up precedent.
00:55:36 I want to say something about that case.
00:55:37 You have to force people to do shit like that.
00:55:38 Now, this could be just a rumor.
00:55:40 I don't remember where I heard this,
00:55:42 but these people who, you know, asked for the cake,
00:55:46 they deliberately went around every single cake shop,
00:55:51 cake shop, looking for someone who would refuse them.
00:55:55 So they were out looking for trouble rather than like.
00:55:59 That is interesting context as well.
00:56:01 No, I heard, I heard from DeVoo.
00:56:03 Like I saw a video he posted,
00:56:06 he was talking about this on Twitter a while ago,
00:56:08 where the lady who was like being charged said
00:56:11 that she knew the guy who asked for the cake and like very well.
00:56:16 And he was, he was okay with it,
00:56:17 but it was like the, you know, one of his friends
00:56:21 that made it a thing that became viral
00:56:23 and then everybody got outraged and neither party,
00:56:27 like the guy who tried to buy the cake
00:56:29 and the person who was selling the cake,
00:56:30 they were on good terms,
00:56:31 but it was like it blew up on the internet
00:56:33 and then she was like fucked over by the government,
00:56:37 which is the reason it's so fucking terrible.
00:56:39 Even assuming that's completely true,
00:56:41 which I would believe that's true.
00:56:42 I, you know, I haven't looked it up myself,
00:56:43 but like assuming that's all true,
00:56:45 I don't even care because I totally believe you should,
00:56:48 if you just are a sincere racist
00:56:51 and you don't want to make cake for whatever race you hate,
00:56:54 you 100% should be allowed to not do it
00:56:57 because you just don't want to.
00:56:59 There was no, I see no reason to force people to do that.
00:57:02 And just as everyone else is trying to think
00:57:03 you're a fucking douchebag
00:57:04 and you get all the social consequences that come with it.
00:57:05 Exactly, because what you do is,
00:57:07 you tell everybody that he did that
00:57:09 and then you stop shopping at his place.
00:57:10 And you know what, you know what,
00:57:11 I would prefer a world where somebody could like punch you
00:57:15 in the face for you being a bigot,
00:57:18 then go to jail over something that goes viral.
00:57:21 About the whole,
00:57:22 because you know what, going to jail does nothing to fix.
00:57:24 It does not fix the person's racism at all.
00:57:27 It doesn't do anything to fix it.
00:57:29 Whereas if you punch the guy in the face
00:57:30 and you have a man-to-man moment about like,
00:57:32 oh shit dude, I guess the Hispanics can punch good.
00:57:36 I respect you now.
00:57:37 Then you've maybe, maybe this person
00:57:38 is not ever as simple as that.
00:57:40 I mean, I mean, something like.
00:57:42 This is, yeah, yeah, but like I just wanted to quickly say
00:57:45 about the whole, you know, not,
00:57:47 if you don't want to sell to these people,
00:57:49 you're free to do.
00:57:50 I think that only for like maybe personal businesses,
00:57:55 like for like, I don't know, like what do you guys have?
00:57:58 Like we have ASDA, you guys have like, what sort of like.
00:58:02 I'm not following that.
00:58:04 Yeah, yeah, Walmart.
00:58:05 Like a Walmart or something.
00:58:05 Oh yeah, okay.
00:58:06 ASDA is owned by Walmart, I think.
00:58:08 Oh, is it?
00:58:08 Okay, well now I know.
00:58:09 Well, yeah, like shops like that should, you know,
00:58:13 accommodate all people of all walks of life.
00:58:15 I only like.
00:58:16 I kind of disagree.
00:58:17 I mean, I kind of disagree.
00:58:19 Well, yeah, I would say that there should be no restrictions
00:58:23 in place about that.
00:58:25 But like, obviously, if you are a supermarket
00:58:27 and you don't let a certain amount of people in,
00:58:29 that's a certain amount of customers you're not getting
00:58:31 and money runs everything.
00:58:33 So like, why would you not?
00:58:34 There's no reason as a big corporation to like deny
00:58:37 a certain group.
00:58:38 If there's no motive for a corporation to do it.
00:58:40 That's just less money for you.
00:58:42 That's just all that it does.
00:58:43 Like a big corporation, like you have this chain sort of
00:58:48 places and stuff like that, you're everywhere.
00:58:51 It's not just one person having their own private little shop
00:58:55 of their own private little things.
00:58:57 So I think.
00:58:59 I think it's the same thing though.
00:59:01 I feel like both the corporations and the personal people
00:59:04 should be able to choose whether or not they sell to anyone.
00:59:07 You can definitely have a situation where like,
00:59:09 let's say a Walmart comes into like a small ish town
00:59:11 and because Walmart can undercut the prices of all the mom
00:59:14 and pop shops, like they all go out of business.
00:59:17 Let's say like they were all ruled, you know,
00:59:18 by fucking Mexican people who, you know,
00:59:20 live in America, whatever, Mexican, you know,
00:59:22 historically, their ancestors.
00:59:24 And like, so all those shops closed down.
00:59:26 There's only Walmart.
00:59:27 Oh, and by the way, Walmart refuses to sell to Mexican people.
00:59:30 Like I get why that's a problem.
00:59:33 That makes sense to like be wary.
00:59:35 But what I would like is that the Mexican community or whatever
00:59:39 makes their own grocery store that does sell to Mexican.
00:59:42 And then they like, because they're such a large population,
00:59:45 they make all the money.
00:59:46 I mean, hopefully.
00:59:47 It sounds like a terrible like idea to have, you know,
00:59:51 just Walmart that only Mexicans can't eat.
00:59:54 And it's like, well, what the fuck are we gonna do?
00:59:56 And it's not necessarily possible for them to just suddenly
00:59:59 make a rival supermarket chain.
01:00:01 But like in like, hypothetically, they would make that
01:00:05 and then they would get so much like,
01:00:07 like a hundred percent of the Mexican profit from that area.
01:00:10 Right.
01:00:10 It's just, when you think about what it means,
01:00:13 like what we're saying is we are going to force people
01:00:16 in businesses to do what the government tells them to do.
01:00:19 We are, and like Walmart doesn't owe its customers anything.
01:00:23 Walmart existing is a pure boon to you.
01:00:26 Walmart could close down and leave today from anywhere it wants.
01:00:30 And like they were 100% in their rights to do so.
01:00:33 So like you're asking Walmart to basically like give you
01:00:37 something it doesn't have to give you if you're, you know,
01:00:39 like imposing.
01:00:40 The thing to understand about Walmart is that you can't,
01:00:43 you can't have a one Walmart decide,
01:00:45 I'm just not going to sell to Mexican people.
01:00:47 Like Walmart has a corporate policy that every Walmart has to abide by.
01:00:51 So if Walmart decided tomorrow they're not going to sell to Mexicans,
01:00:55 every Walmart would have to fucking abide by that.
01:00:57 Well, yeah.
01:00:58 Walmart corporation would not survive a move like that.
01:01:01 Like the backlash from social media would tank the entire company.
01:01:05 Capitalism is absolutely shown.
01:01:07 The whole point of capitalism is to get as much money
01:01:09 from as many people as possible.
01:01:10 So it's a great engine to fight against that stuff.
01:01:13 And also imagine that Walmart tried, like they said,
01:01:17 they had that policy.
01:01:17 No Mexicans allowed.
01:01:19 And then the entire country of Mexico is like,
01:01:22 they can't build there anymore.
01:01:23 That's like.
01:01:24 They just lost a country worth of revenue.
01:01:26 Yeah.
01:01:26 Yeah.
01:01:26 It's like, it's just, it makes no sense.
01:01:28 And it doesn't seem like it would ever happen.
01:01:30 But in the hypothetical that a company did decide to do that,
01:01:34 I would let them.
01:01:35 I wouldn't be like, I mean, I would hate them.
01:01:37 I think that was the stupidest and most horrible thing you could do.
01:01:40 What the fuck?
01:01:41 You know, it'll be all in the news.
01:01:43 But like, I don't think there should be a law that says
01:01:45 you have to cater to every person that comes in.
01:01:49 That's what I think.
01:01:50 That's what I think.
01:01:50 And I'm totally for, I got no problem with any race
01:01:53 or any social group or whatever, sell to everybody.
01:01:55 But if like, if I really believe in a principled way in freedom,
01:02:00 and I believe in, you know, being consistent here,
01:02:03 I think it is morally wrong to compel someone's labor
01:02:07 at the point of a gun as the state does.
01:02:09 And by that same token, like as much as I think
01:02:13 it's stupid and retarded, I would say the exact same thing
01:02:16 to like, you know, those small businesses that charge white people
01:02:19 more for things to try and like redistribute wealth
01:02:22 for like black communities and stuff.
01:02:23 They're like small businesses that do that.
01:02:24 I wouldn't shop there.
01:02:25 That's fine.
01:02:26 I mean, of course.
01:02:26 It just makes sense to not shop there.
01:02:27 Yeah.
01:02:28 Like, I'm not going to do it because like,
01:02:30 why would I shoot myself in the foot like that?
01:02:31 But like, you're free to do that.
01:02:32 If you want to discriminate against me, that's fine.
01:02:34 But I'm never going to buy a coffee.
01:02:35 Or you know what, there was a,
01:02:36 like, I heard something on the news recently
01:02:38 about like a business that like, they just had like,
01:02:41 something like a reparations day.
01:02:43 But like, all it was was they just collected money
01:02:45 and then just like gave to like the local African American community.
01:02:48 But like, this was just their money.
01:02:50 So like, that's fine.
01:02:51 That's no problem at all.
01:02:52 They just wanted to give money to people.
01:02:54 That's totally cool for whatever fucking thing they wanted their money.
01:02:57 Yeah.
01:02:57 Exactly.
01:02:58 I just believe in freedom, man.
01:02:59 That's all.
01:03:00 I mean, we're kind of on a huge tangent here.
01:03:02 I forget how we got here.
01:03:03 But no, we're talking about Twitter fighting, dude.
01:03:05 Fighting, fighting.
01:03:06 That's the problem right there.
01:03:08 Uh-huh.
01:03:09 Disagree with the whole.
01:03:11 I mean, I believe in, you know, in the whole freedom.
01:03:13 Maze doesn't believe in freedom, guys.
01:03:15 I don't believe in freedom.
01:03:17 I just, I don't see a reason not to sell to a group of people things.
01:03:23 But Maze, you see what you're doing there.
01:03:24 As you're saying that you don't see a reason,
01:03:26 you're imposing your thought process on other people
01:03:29 by saying that because you don't see a reason,
01:03:32 everyone should do what you think they should do.
01:03:33 No, I never said that.
01:03:35 I'm just saying I'm so...
01:03:36 Well, you're implying it.
01:03:37 I'm explaining what that's implying.
01:03:38 Well, no, I'm not.
01:03:40 I want to say, I want to say, I like this, this, this, this,
01:03:43 this is a difficult topic.
01:03:44 And I, I've yet to set my opinion in any which way.
01:03:48 It's just, it doesn't sound right to me.
01:03:51 So I'm just like, I'm, I'm mildly disagreeing.
01:03:55 But I'm not, I'm not, I'm not agreeing.
01:03:57 It doesn't sound good to say.
01:03:58 I'm not agreeing with the opposite side either.
01:04:00 That's the thing.
01:04:01 I'm just sort of like on the fence, I guess.
01:04:02 I'm not sure.
01:04:04 I think, I think the problem is that like to hold the position
01:04:06 that we're talking about is letting the opportunity
01:04:10 for horrible things to happen.
01:04:11 Oh, yes.
01:04:12 And like that's, that is, that is the price you pay to let,
01:04:16 to, to, to be 100% free.
01:04:18 It's like, you have to give people the opportunity
01:04:20 to do fucking terrible things, like offensive things,
01:04:23 but they also get to reap all the rewards
01:04:26 of doing those terrible things,
01:04:27 which is to piss off everybody who's not a fucking retard.
01:04:30 I feel like there should be some sort of solution,
01:04:32 like a middle ground, like a golden mill between these,
01:04:34 but I can't find it.
01:04:35 The middle ground is that people have money,
01:04:40 and the more people you are nice to,
01:04:41 the more money you will get from your people buying stuff.
01:04:44 Yeah.
01:04:45 So like the more palatable you are,
01:04:47 the more, you know, open you are to anyone and everyone,
01:04:51 the more money you'll make.
01:04:52 So there's an incentive to be nice in a,
01:04:55 in a world where you can do that.
01:04:57 Yeah.
01:04:57 So that, we would, one would hope that that is the compulsion.
01:05:00 By the way, that is the compulsion that a lot of these
01:05:02 huge companies like Walmart are absolutely driven by.
01:05:05 Walmart wants to get money from everybody.
01:05:07 So that's, that's the policy they've adopted.
01:05:09 Seems that way to me anyway.
01:05:11 Anywho, that's my point.
01:05:12 Well, okay, issues noted, issues noted.
01:05:15 Um, all right.
01:05:17 Any, what else do we have to fucking say
01:05:19 about fighting and shit?
01:05:21 Why don't you just die if you fight me?
01:05:26 That's what I have to say.
01:05:28 I, I don't want to punch you.
01:05:29 I just want you to fall down.
01:05:31 Um, I, I've had like a number of like little boy fights.
01:05:35 Like when I was just, you know, I didn't know how to,
01:05:39 because people would, you know, how kids, they,
01:05:42 everyone's scared of actually doing anything
01:05:44 when they're the same age, same height, you know,
01:05:46 they're not bullies, they're just being brats to each other.
01:05:49 And they're like, you know, they say mean things
01:05:52 because they want you to do the first move
01:05:54 because then you're the one who gets in trouble.
01:05:57 And I'm like, I, I don't have a diss track.
01:05:59 I don't know how to say fuck you in any other way.
01:06:02 Or like if I was a rapper, I would just say fuck you
01:06:05 as the, my diss track.
01:06:06 And then bam, bam, you know, that's, that's all it would be.
01:06:10 It was just like, I just want to deck here
01:06:12 because that's all I need to say.
01:06:14 And that's, I didn't really like have like the,
01:06:18 the gumption to do it a lot at school.
01:06:21 But I would always like resort to shoves and like, you know,
01:06:25 being like a weirdo.
01:06:26 I guess it was just like, I was a shovy boy.
01:06:29 I was a weirdo.
01:06:30 I would be like excessively violent at sports.
01:06:33 Like in soccer, like I was, I loved playing defense
01:06:38 because I could kick people.
01:06:39 I think I've said this a bunch of times, like.
01:06:41 See, we're all looking for an outlet, dude.
01:06:43 We all have, you know, we need, we need to bring back duels,
01:06:49 but they just have to be non-lethal.
01:06:50 We have to have like, on the book, duels.
01:06:53 I'd love to slap a guy with a fucking glove
01:06:55 and say duel right now.
01:06:56 I'd challenge you to a duel.
01:06:57 And then it's, it's, you get, there's like regulation for it.
01:07:00 There's like a way that it's, it's, it's, it's designed to be done.
01:07:03 And we can just fucking throw down with people.
01:07:05 And then it's decided to be legal.
01:07:08 Oh, that's a good one.
01:07:09 Ring top hats.
01:07:09 Yes.
01:07:11 Radcon for dual.
01:07:12 Literal duels.
01:07:14 All right, all right.
01:07:15 We should literally kill each other in the ring.
01:07:18 Yeah.
01:07:19 Dude, Radcon four should be, we should hire out
01:07:21 like a wrestling ring and just do that.
01:07:23 Oh man.
01:07:23 Like easy to wrestling.
01:07:24 If we can have some sort of IRL wrestling thing.
01:07:27 Guys, you're missing the most of, we need to,
01:07:29 we need to have Radcon four be in Lithuania
01:07:31 in mage's hometown so we can join the violent violence and fucking throw down.
01:07:36 Like I said, it's a lot nicer now.
01:07:39 Yeah, we're going to bring it back.
01:07:40 As tourists.
01:07:41 We're going to bomb it the fuck out.
01:07:42 So you can bring back.
01:07:43 Mage, our arrival is going to be the end of your time skip.
01:07:46 And that's going to be the next chapter in your manga.
01:07:48 Yeah.
01:07:49 That's good.
01:07:49 When the B cash.
01:07:50 So it's all, it's all nice, it's all nice and presentable now.
01:07:53 But when we're there, well, things are going to go down.
01:07:57 You said you weren't much of a, like a verbal fight boy.
01:08:03 You just, you wanted to get physical.
01:08:04 I would, I would scowl and like want to kill them.
01:08:06 And that's all I would do.
01:08:07 That's understandable.
01:08:08 I was definitely more of a like, I was never good at it.
01:08:11 And I would get really sweaty and nervous and uncomfortable whenever someone like
01:08:15 dissed me via verbs as a young man.
01:08:18 And still to this day, like if somebody comes up to me and starts talking smack.
01:08:22 Oh, get a little hot under the collar when I realized the shit is going down.
01:08:26 And now girls are watching and I need to impress them with my, with my responses.
01:08:31 It's just like, I don't know, I've enjoyed those in history and it feels really good
01:08:38 when you're able to like bring a sick comeback like George Costanza and just like, you know,
01:08:43 defeat someone through a verbal confrontation like that.
01:08:46 I like those.
01:08:48 I enjoy those on the, on the occasions they happen.
01:08:51 But they were unfortunately rare.
01:08:52 A linguistic kill shot.
01:08:53 I was.
01:08:53 Oh, guys.
01:08:54 That's right.
01:08:55 Speaking of stuff like that, what do you think about like the phrase, be the bigger man?
01:09:01 Like in terms of like not resorting to violence and just letting people shit on you.
01:09:07 The thing about being the bigger man is I never really liked that.
01:09:10 It's useful up to a point, like because there is a time if you just continue to be the bigger
01:09:15 man forever, then you're just being a pussy and you're letting people like steamroll you.
01:09:20 So that's no good.
01:09:21 Like, but the thing, I would, I would argue that the idea of being the bigger man,
01:09:24 like we all recognize that at a certain point, like if some dude like punches your sister
01:09:30 and you are the bigger man and don't like confront and you're like, oh, he's not even worth.
01:09:35 Well, at that point it's like, well, now you're just like being a bitch.
01:09:39 Being, being the bigger man is also, it's like a subset of choosing your battles.
01:09:43 It's, it means don't swing wildly for no reason.
01:09:46 But sometimes you do swing.
01:09:48 Sometimes it is a problem.
01:09:49 Sometimes you gotta swing.
01:09:51 I was, I was sort of taught that eventually because like I said, I was, I was the tallest
01:09:56 kid around usually in my age group.
01:09:59 So, you know, for me, like for onlookers, it just looked like I was beating up little kids.
01:10:07 Yeah, that's true.
01:10:08 It's tough to be a big boy because you always look like the bully in a situation.
01:10:12 And it's, it's weird.
01:10:13 It seems like there's a pattern of like small, skinny kids, like bullying, larger,
01:10:17 generally fat kids.
01:10:19 It seems like a pattern.
01:10:20 And then I don't know, maybe it's cause like, I don't know.
01:10:23 I've seen this, like there's that one famous video of like the skinny kid,
01:10:27 like bullying this like bigger, fatter, taller guy who was just like quiet and timid.
01:10:31 And then he fucking like, he like, he picks him up and he like slams him on the ground
01:10:35 because he just had enough finally and it's awesome.
01:10:38 I mean, the reason that happens is I'm sure is because like the young, the small weak kid
01:10:45 is too scared to actually fight the people who are like the real problem.
01:10:50 So they go for, they go for the easier target.
01:10:53 So it's like, it's easy to say someone's fat when they are fat and that's what they do.
01:10:57 I have two more stories I can tell.
01:11:00 Okay, shoot.
01:11:01 Quickly in the neighborhood, like a lot of the fights I noticed I would have like consensual,
01:11:10 like it wasn't like no one was bullying anyone.
01:11:13 We were just fighting because it was cool and fun and we sort of picked fights with each other.
01:11:17 You just wanted to fight.
01:11:18 You kind of, yeah.
01:11:19 Literally a show.
01:11:19 We were not being, you know, watched by any parents or anything and fighting was a past
01:11:25 time I guess.
01:11:26 But anyway, like I think we used to do, the guys of the neighborhood would pester the girls,
01:11:33 but like this is sort of like, it's a, it was an agreement between us.
01:11:37 It was like a sudden agreement.
01:11:38 We all knew this.
01:11:39 We'd never really talked about this, but the guys would pester us.
01:11:42 They would call us names, a specific name actually.
01:11:45 They called us tigers.
01:11:46 I'll explain that later.
01:11:47 And whenever they would do that, the girls would chase after the guys and if they caught
01:11:51 up to the guys, they would beat the guys up and they would come back for more later.
01:11:57 So, you know, it's not like, you know, we were bullying them or anything.
01:11:59 They specifically sought us out to be beat up.
01:12:04 Damn, maybe it was like a fetish thing for them.
01:12:06 They were into it.
01:12:06 And the reason they...
01:12:07 That opens up a lot of doors, mage.
01:12:09 I'm very...
01:12:09 Yeah, it's true.
01:12:10 That's interesting.
01:12:11 And the reason we would call tigers, it wasn't like, it seemed a lot less weird than it does
01:12:19 now is because like, in a way it was for them to tease us.
01:12:24 And but at the same time, we sort of accepted the name and whenever we would like, hear that
01:12:29 and like, sort of like, to signal that we're about to chase them, we would let out a growl.
01:12:36 And so, you were literally a purple tiger.
01:12:40 Kind of, I guess, yeah.
01:12:41 Later on...
01:12:42 So, I'm just...
01:12:43 There's a character in one piece who's called the purple tiger, Fujitora.
01:12:46 I think you are that guy.
01:12:48 I don't know how they look like, but...
01:12:50 That's what I have to say.
01:12:51 Okay.
01:12:52 He's an old man who's blind.
01:12:53 Yes, that's me.
01:12:54 Uh, that's it.
01:12:55 Yeah, sounds right.
01:12:56 Sounds about right.
01:12:57 Yeah, one of my friends got a different name later on because there was a TV series about
01:13:03 like, Xena warrior princess.
01:13:06 And she could do like a similar kind of jump that she did and also the noise she did,
01:13:11 like the work writhing.
01:13:13 And because of that, she got started being called Xena.
01:13:17 The rest of us stayed just tigers.
01:13:20 That's pretty sick, dude.
01:13:22 And the last...
01:13:23 That's so funny.
01:13:25 Like, I just really like that.
01:13:27 How young were you when you were doing that sort of stuff?
01:13:30 No, it was definitely before Xena.
01:13:33 Before eight.
01:13:35 Because like around...
01:13:36 So yeah, it's just sort of a really cute, like child kids running around saying tiger,
01:13:41 because as like a, as like a known, um, initiation of like, let's play...
01:13:45 Yeah, like, let's play tag and then you get to beat me up if I lose.
01:13:50 How do you say tiger in Lithuania?
01:13:52 Tigris.
01:13:52 But that's like the male version.
01:13:54 So the, um, uh, and the general version for the tiger, but we were called Tigris.
01:14:00 That's the plural of tiger for females.
01:14:04 Cool.
01:14:05 And that's...
01:14:06 Yeah, like...
01:14:08 So next time we get to Radcon and Major doesn't show up, we just got to Skype her
01:14:12 and be like, and just call her out and she'll come running and like three hours,
01:14:16 four hours later, she'll be on the plane and then in the middle of the night,
01:14:20 she'll jump across the ocean.
01:14:23 You call me and then you call me tiger and I hang up and like 12 hours later,
01:14:27 you all get punched out of nowhere.
01:14:29 Yeah, exactly.
01:14:30 Out of nowhere.
01:14:31 The violent violence comes through town.
01:14:33 Yeah, exactly.
01:14:34 Just fucking wretches all our shit.
01:14:35 Oh, yeah.
01:14:36 Good to know.
01:14:37 Yeah, I stopped fighting around 12, 13 years old, by the way.
01:14:40 That's when I got bullied, uh, just for the reference.
01:14:44 So all these fighting stories was roughly 10 or younger.
01:14:49 I see, I see.
01:14:50 Yeah, one story, uh, it was around the time I sort of stopped liking to fight.
01:14:56 Around 12 years old, I think.
01:14:58 I think one of my last battles, I guess, so to speak, was in my friend's neighborhood.
01:15:05 The friend was like, she was the daughter of my mom's friend.
01:15:08 So we were friends just because our moms were friends,
01:15:11 but she was like six years younger than me.
01:15:14 And we were playing outside and she got bullied by these group of guys.
01:15:19 And so I stood up for her because, you know, she was a little kid and they were like,
01:15:25 sort of my age, a little bit younger, I think, you know, one or two years off.
01:15:31 So there were three of us girls and three of those guys,
01:15:34 but those two girls just watched, thanks.
01:15:38 And so it was supposed to be one-on-one with me and a guy.
01:15:43 And I remember, you know, throwing punches and punches,
01:15:46 and he sort of blocked by doing like an X in front of him with his arms
01:15:50 because he saw it in Dragon Ball Z.
01:15:52 And remember, specifically, he said, it's like,
01:15:55 hey, guys, this actually works.
01:15:56 And they punched him in the gut while he was distracted.
01:16:01 Why? What? Oh, because he was blocking like too high?
01:16:03 Yeah, he was, yeah.
01:16:04 And then like, because, yeah, because he kind of sort of moved his arms or something like that.
01:16:08 I remember I punched him in the gut because he got distracted.
01:16:11 So I was winning the fight, but then the other guys sort of started hitting me from behind.
01:16:16 But they were all being a little bit chicken about it.
01:16:20 They didn't like pile on top of me.
01:16:21 They just like hit me and then like went back again.
01:16:24 So I wouldn't hit them.
01:16:26 That's even worse.
01:16:27 That's even worse.
01:16:27 I know.
01:16:28 And like, I wasn't getting any sort of backup from my friend or her friend's friend.
01:16:32 I hope they're dead.
01:16:33 Fuck.
01:16:34 No, it's okay.
01:16:35 But I...
01:16:35 Disgusting.
01:16:36 But yeah, like, I think I eventually did win the fight.
01:16:39 I don't remember how, but I remember I won the fight.
01:16:42 And then I told him to leave us alone.
01:16:45 And I told my friend I'm going home, well, her home because I was in her neighborhood.
01:16:51 And as I was walking up the stairs, I started crying.
01:16:54 Even though I won.
01:16:55 You did or...
01:16:56 I did.
01:16:57 I started crying.
01:16:58 Were you just...
01:16:58 Did it just hurt or something?
01:16:59 No, I was sort of frustrated mostly because I won all that fight all by myself.
01:17:05 And, you know, those girls didn't help me win any...
01:17:09 You know, at all they were just there watching.
01:17:11 They didn't even go...
01:17:12 Betrayed.
01:17:12 They didn't even go ask for help from like our parents or anything.
01:17:16 And, you know, it could have gotten a lot worse.
01:17:18 I was happy I won, but I was mostly frustrated that I wasn't helped.
01:17:23 But that was usually the case whenever I did fight and I had friends with me.
01:17:26 My friends never intervened, even though the guys would sometimes...
01:17:29 Bitches be trifling, man.
01:17:31 Bitches be trifling.
01:17:34 But yeah.
01:17:34 Well, what a world.
01:17:38 What a life.
01:17:39 What a life.
01:17:40 And now it's over.
01:17:42 And we've got a new anime life lying before us.
01:17:46 Uh, well guys, I'm out of fucking stories.
01:17:49 How about we just get to the next fucking part?
01:17:50 How about we just fucking fight right now?
01:17:53 Let's just fight.
01:17:54 I'm punching my microphone.
01:17:55 Die.
01:17:56 Die.
01:17:57 I'm killing you all.
01:17:57 Fucking idiot.
01:17:58 I'm not his microphone.
01:18:03 All right, let's get the fuck out of here.
01:18:05 Okay, so we're done with the main thing.
01:18:07 That was good.
01:18:07 That was good.
01:18:08 Let's...
01:18:09 So we're in our next little section here.
01:18:11 Anything to say about our last episode?
01:18:13 So everybody listen out there.
01:18:15 When you're here in this...
01:18:16 So we recorded this two days after the last episode came out.
01:18:20 And we did this.
01:18:22 The way we changed the whole schedule was so that we have time
01:18:25 to like look at the fucking comments of the last episode,
01:18:27 see what people are saying,
01:18:28 and just see if there's anything to be revisited
01:18:31 with that little extra window.
01:18:33 So what the fuck was last week's episode?
01:18:35 I can't even remember.
01:18:36 Childhood?
01:18:36 PCP.
01:18:37 It was the one with all the stuff.
01:18:38 Childhood.
01:18:39 That's the one.
01:18:40 Childhood, yes.
01:18:41 Which I think everybody loved and was great.
01:18:43 Not a lot of people because I think...
01:18:45 I saw a few people be complaining
01:18:47 because we had a lot of people on again, but...
01:18:50 That's true.
01:18:51 That's true.
01:18:52 We might be slightly overdoing it.
01:18:54 But there were people who were saying that they liked the fact
01:18:56 that there's a rowdiness when there's a lot of people.
01:18:58 A lot of people, yeah, you can't please all of them.
01:19:00 So I'm sorry, you know, people sometimes
01:19:03 are gonna have a few episodes where there's a lot of us
01:19:05 and sometimes we'll have episodes like this.
01:19:06 Well, you know what I would say, though?
01:19:08 I would say that it is...
01:19:09 It's more accessible.
01:19:11 Like the people who are gonna listen
01:19:12 will listen anyway because they like the PCP.
01:19:14 But we should cater to the possible outsider
01:19:17 and do the thing that the outsider would like
01:19:19 because we've already entrapped the general reader.
01:19:23 But it's bringing new audience members is the priority.
01:19:26 You don't think so?
01:19:27 I mean, I agree that that is a priority.
01:19:30 I think that there's no reason to never do a big thing again
01:19:33 because clearly people do like that.
01:19:35 And if we stop doing that for the benefit of the normie crowd
01:19:40 coming in, then the people who did like that
01:19:43 are just gonna be pissed off and annoyed that we're not doing it.
01:19:45 Personally, I like the idea that a few episodes are like,
01:19:48 you know, just four of us and a few episodes are like,
01:19:51 you know, most of us.
01:19:52 I like the variety, I like the randomness.
01:19:56 PCP is like a box of chocolates.
01:19:59 You never know what you're getting.
01:20:00 You never know whether it's got...
01:20:01 You look at the labels and talk and you know exactly what you're getting.
01:20:03 Well, I mean, you know, if you're in the PCP fan discord, you know...
01:20:07 It's true.
01:20:09 Give us your money.
01:20:10 PCP is like a box of chocolates.
01:20:12 You never know whether it's too expensive or not,
01:20:15 and you don't want to buy it really.
01:20:17 Hey, here's the thing.
01:20:17 Here's a comment that somebody left.
01:20:19 EatSumoListless left this.
01:20:21 This is mildly amusing.
01:20:23 This guy says,
01:20:23 I got your Christian names here, fam.
01:20:25 So this is in response to the whole like middle name
01:20:27 that you guys named with your Christian.
01:20:30 Let's see, Nate, not a cog in the machine.
01:20:33 Best man.
01:20:33 Good.
01:20:34 Yes.
01:20:34 Digi played with sticks until 17, bro.
01:20:38 Uh, Mage...
01:20:39 Christianity is a fairy tale.
01:20:41 Purple.
01:20:42 It is.
01:20:42 Mage purple.
01:20:43 Or it was a fairy tale, whatever.
01:20:45 Ben, daddy watched me on cameras.
01:20:47 I like that one the most.
01:20:49 Munchy cartoons weren't cool until My Little Pony, Tiny Hats.
01:20:55 The dad raised us to be happy.
01:20:57 Davoo.
01:20:58 That's a strange one.
01:21:00 And hippo school was fun.
01:21:02 Correct.
01:21:02 Why is everyone, everyone you have like your username sort of divided up
01:21:06 that mine has purple?
01:21:08 I mean, I'm not complaining about the purple part,
01:21:10 but he could have had like...
01:21:11 I don't know, dude.
01:21:11 Lethal or at the end or something.
01:21:14 I guess because he would have had to start with lethal
01:21:16 and then put like something, something Aurora Mage,
01:21:18 and he wanted the Mage to be like the first part.
01:21:20 No, no, no, no.
01:21:20 He split up someone else oddly enough as well.
01:21:24 Well, he split up the Davoo weird the,
01:21:26 then like middle name Davoo.
01:21:28 I don't know.
01:21:29 In any case, like I'm not complaining about the purple.
01:21:31 It's a good enough word to use for me.
01:21:35 Just, I just found it as weird.
01:21:37 Indeed.
01:21:38 And instead of that was episode 111,
01:21:40 I see the memes, I see the ones spammed in chat.
01:21:43 They have been noted, observed, appreciate.
01:21:46 I kind of don't like that sometimes.
01:21:48 Because I feel like some people didn't give actual comments
01:21:52 because they wrote a one comment.
01:21:53 Well, maybe, but this is episode 111.
01:21:56 It's, if there was ever a time to spam that one in chat,
01:21:59 it had to be this time.
01:22:01 And what about the 1111?
01:22:03 Well, we'll get there one of these days.
01:22:04 That'll take eight years, I think, or is it 10 years?
01:22:07 10 years, actually.
01:22:08 It'll take to get there.
01:22:08 Hey, maybe the potty cuss will be over by then.
01:22:11 Maybe, it might be.
01:22:12 We'll see.
01:22:14 All right.
01:22:14 I mean, I got nothing to say about that episode.
01:22:16 Yeah, let's just move on.
01:22:17 Let's move the fuck along.
01:22:18 Let's go, let's do questions.
01:22:19 It's time for the questions, everybody.
01:22:21 It's time.
01:22:23 Let me, let me go to this whole, this whole Twitter over here.
01:22:27 All right.
01:22:27 What do we got?
01:22:28 What do we got?
01:22:29 Questions, please give us a good fucking question.
01:22:32 Um, here we go.
01:22:33 At Captain Thought One asks, uh,
01:22:36 what's the cure for cynicism, my boys?
01:22:38 That's a thought-provoking question.
01:22:40 Uh, cure for cynicism.
01:22:42 Season one and two of My Little Pony.
01:22:46 There you go, guys.
01:22:47 Oh, he's right.
01:22:48 Oh, he's right.
01:22:49 I'm trying to think, cynicism, like, in what sense?
01:22:52 Well, okay, let me think.
01:22:53 Like, is that, um, like a nihilist sort of cynicism?
01:22:56 Yeah, like, I'm interpreting this the way that I understand it,
01:22:59 but it's like, okay, let's say you've been watching anime for a million years
01:23:03 and you get older and you're like, uh, anime isn't good anymore.
01:23:06 How do you, how do you enjoy, how do you love anime again?
01:23:09 Or, or insert media of your choice here?
01:23:11 I mean, according to Ratatouille, you gotta just go back to your past
01:23:16 and remember why you started, what you started.
01:23:18 Like, what, what, how did I get here?
01:23:20 Why do I do anything?
01:23:21 You know what?
01:23:22 You're right.
01:23:23 That was the message of, of yesterday's new My Hero Academia,
01:23:27 the fucking hypest moment ever.
01:23:29 Was it the manga or the, the anime episode?
01:23:31 It was the anime episode.
01:23:33 Okay.
01:23:33 Well, why would I have actually read most of that?
01:23:35 Was it when the, the big guy jumped around and he smashed the guy
01:23:38 and he said, fuck you, bitch.
01:23:40 And then everyone was like, whoa, he's so strong.
01:23:43 And that, I agree.
01:23:44 Help me out, Tom.
01:23:44 What happens?
01:23:45 I've actually read most of that.
01:23:46 Well, what, which episode was that?
01:23:47 This was the episode with the United States of Smash,
01:23:50 when All Might has to remember his past and where he came from
01:23:53 to fucking beat all for one.
01:23:54 It was fucking insane.
01:23:55 Is that, did he, so he'd just beat, uh, what was it?
01:23:57 It's all for one.
01:23:58 All for one, right?
01:23:59 Yeah.
01:23:59 He just beat those the last episode.
01:24:01 That is like the best moment in the fucking series.
01:24:04 It is.
01:24:04 Dude, they animated it so well.
01:24:06 Oh, it was delicious.
01:24:07 Oh, it was great.
01:24:07 I kind of want to watch My Hero Academia.
01:24:09 Like I've read the manga mostly, uh, but-
01:24:12 It's fucking great.
01:24:13 It's a lot of episodes.
01:24:13 It's, dude, it's like-
01:24:14 I hear it's animated so well, though,
01:24:16 that I kind of want to watch it just for that alone.
01:24:18 Have you, have you watched any of it?
01:24:20 I've seen like a couple, like, what do they call it?
01:24:21 Saka burros.
01:24:22 Like that one moment where like Ice Fireman,
01:24:25 like snaps his fingers, there's some sparks
01:24:26 and then like a big explosion of flame.
01:24:28 It's like the best anime thing I've ever seen
01:24:30 in my fucking life.
01:24:30 The whole show is like that, dude.
01:24:31 This is so fucking good.
01:24:32 Like, like-
01:24:32 Well, it sounds incredible.
01:24:34 The anime, the anime is better than the manga.
01:24:36 Like, it is unquestionably a better experience.
01:24:40 Have you read the manga, too?
01:24:41 Yes, I'm caught up.
01:24:42 Well, shit, dude.
01:24:42 Uh, I mean, that's a pretty good fucking sell.
01:24:45 Why don't we go to start My Podcast Academia?
01:24:47 My Podcast Academia?
01:24:50 Dude, um, no.
01:24:52 That could be the, that could be the Tom show on the PCP.
01:24:55 That's a terrible idea.
01:24:56 That's a humble bring on people and talk about that show.
01:24:59 I like, mechademia.
01:25:01 I can't wait to talk about how mediocre I find that show to be.
01:25:04 Well, I will hate you forever.
01:25:06 We'll have to fight about it if that's the case.
01:25:07 We will fight about it.
01:25:09 That's true.
01:25:09 I mean, I might be on that as well
01:25:11 because I generally, everything I see about my hero academia,
01:25:14 I'm like, ehh.
01:25:15 That's pretty much how I feel.
01:25:17 And I read like the whole thing.
01:25:18 Uh, but the anime, the anime is just better.
01:25:20 I mean, that's a plus.
01:25:21 The anime is better.
01:25:24 Okay, whatever, enough about bullshit anime.
01:25:25 It doesn't meander.
01:25:26 It's just like, every fight is like.
01:25:27 Okay, well that's good.
01:25:28 Until you guys get like murdered for saying that the anime is better.
01:25:32 I haven't read, so I-
01:25:33 I'm on record as talking about how mediocre I find the series overall.
01:25:37 Like, mostly to be.
01:25:39 I mean, Nate, you're full of terrible opinions.
01:25:42 So I'm not surprised there's another one on the table.
01:25:44 Yeah, fair enough, fair enough.
01:25:46 Um, what else we got?
01:25:47 I mean, here's a question for me, but let me put it at everybody.
01:25:49 At Diploid39 just asks,
01:25:51 Nate, oh, I forgot.
01:25:52 These are the pity questions on the Twitter.
01:25:53 So this will be our last one.
01:25:55 Hashtag asked PCP to at TP Crasnators.
01:25:59 That's the Twitter, but just use the hashtag, whatever.
01:26:02 Nate, how would you want the world to end?
01:26:05 How would you want-
01:26:05 Wait, didn't we answer that before?
01:26:07 I think we did.
01:26:08 Did we?
01:26:09 I don't know.
01:26:09 I- Meteor, smashing into the planet just blows the whole thing up.
01:26:12 That's definitely what I would want.
01:26:14 If I could just choose any of them.
01:26:15 That's the coolest-
01:26:16 Yeah, we definitely answered this before.
01:26:18 But whatever, maybe other people are here.
01:26:20 Any other good ones?
01:26:21 Frozen solid instantly in a block of ice.
01:26:23 That's also a pretty good one.
01:26:23 Heat death of the universe.
01:26:25 We should make it all the way to the end.
01:26:26 Oh, but that's like a slow, scary way to die.
01:26:29 I'd rather just explode all at once in my face, and then it's over.
01:26:32 Think of how-
01:26:33 Actually, a different kind of heat death.
01:26:34 I would rather it blink out of existence, and I feel no pain.
01:26:38 Then it doesn't matter.
01:26:39 That's what I want.
01:26:39 If it's a heat death of the universe, not going to be our problem.
01:26:42 That, I mean, yeah, yeah.
01:26:44 But like, the reality of the heat death of the universe happening-
01:26:46 Think of how far beyond Starfleet we could get to,
01:26:49 if we get all the way to the heat death of the universe.
01:26:51 Well, sure.
01:26:52 But the people who are alive then will be really scared,
01:26:54 and then they'll all die, and they'll be really sad,
01:26:55 because they won't-
01:26:55 That's welcome.
01:26:57 Yeah, fair point.
01:27:01 Mage, how would you want the world to end?
01:27:03 I said this before.
01:27:05 Meteor, quick, quick, quick, and destroy everything.
01:27:11 Okay, we definitely answered this.
01:27:12 All right, give just to reiterate.
01:27:13 I want a big space dog to come up and just take a bite out of the earth.
01:27:20 And then the core will be exposed,
01:27:22 and then it'll crumble into nothingness.
01:27:25 Okay.
01:27:25 That'll be pretty cool.
01:27:26 Well, fuck you.
01:27:27 Space dog.
01:27:28 Fuck you, Diploid, for asking an old question,
01:27:30 making me read it like an asshole.
01:27:31 Fuck you.
01:27:32 All right.
01:27:33 And he has a fucking micro-academia fucking icon.
01:27:36 What a fucking shock.
01:27:38 I have a good question from the patron-
01:27:40 Typical brainwrit.
01:27:41 Yeah, okay.
01:27:42 From Happy D.
01:27:43 He says, when you were a child slash young adult,
01:27:46 did you ever get in any really big fights with your parents or close relatives?
01:27:52 Not generally.
01:27:55 I, one time, I kicked Ben in the stomach for no reason,
01:27:58 and my dad got really mad,
01:28:00 but that wasn't really if, like, he just yelled at me for doing that.
01:28:03 I got screaming master with my mom a lot.
01:28:06 Yeah.
01:28:06 I was very...
01:28:07 About what topic?
01:28:08 Just, just, just everything.
01:28:10 We still butt heads to this day, so.
01:28:12 Yeah, okay.
01:28:13 I just realized that I forgot to...
01:28:15 Non-confrontational, so I never fought with anyone in my family.
01:28:21 All right.
01:28:21 You got it all out on the streets.
01:28:23 That's true.
01:28:25 I am, I didn't talk about this,
01:28:28 but, like, I did have fights with my brothers, like physical fights,
01:28:32 and since I was the oldest one,
01:28:33 I was kind of always the wrong guy,
01:28:36 even though, even though they would do, like,
01:28:38 the classic little brother thing of being an annoying piece of shit,
01:28:41 because they knew that if I fought back,
01:28:43 they would get me in trouble, for sure.
01:28:46 Yeah, they do all that stuff, but, like,
01:28:50 man, I, I was not a good brother sometimes.
01:28:54 Sometimes I was kind of a terrible and evil.
01:28:57 How so?
01:28:58 How so?
01:28:59 Um, I mean, it's not like they, it was out of nowhere.
01:29:04 Like, I wouldn't just come home from school
01:29:05 and then punch my brother in the face.
01:29:07 It wouldn't be like that,
01:29:08 but it would be like, we would be arguing about something,
01:29:11 and, you know, maybe one of my brothers had had a bad day,
01:29:14 and I had had a bad day,
01:29:15 and then we'd argue about something,
01:29:17 and then it would turn into, like, a scuffle,
01:29:19 and then a punch, and then a throw things across the room,
01:29:22 and then screaming, and it's like, oh, God.
01:29:24 Oh, not good.
01:29:26 That sounds hilarious.
01:29:27 I mean, it, we are, like, really close now, because, you know, we're just...
01:29:32 Brothers get closer, they get older, I think.
01:29:35 And I think a part of it is because we had fights.
01:29:38 If we never talked to each other and we just kept to ourselves,
01:29:40 we'd probably be like some of those weird, like,
01:29:43 estranged siblings sort of deals where, like, nobody talks to each other.
01:29:47 Like, I've seen that in media, and I'm like,
01:29:49 that doesn't make any sense.
01:29:50 My brothers are in a mere fucking tight...
01:29:52 Like, Ben and I fought, and, you know, I didn't think of this either.
01:29:54 Ben and I definitely fought sometimes.
01:29:56 We had, like, these trampoline battles
01:29:57 where we'd, like, do flips onto each other and stuff.
01:29:59 Those are pretty cool.
01:30:00 Oh, that's funny fighting.
01:30:02 Yeah, that's not, like, rage fighting.
01:30:04 Only once in a while.
01:30:06 Like, Ben historically was known...
01:30:08 Or my sister historically was known to, when aggressed,
01:30:11 curl into a ball on the floor and just, like, lie there
01:30:15 and attempt to just, like, you know...
01:30:17 Like, when she did that, like, you couldn't hit her
01:30:19 because, like, she's being too pathetic.
01:30:21 So you couldn't punch her no matter how bad you wanted to.
01:30:25 And I wanted to a lot all the time.
01:30:28 You know, it's where my addiction to beating women
01:30:31 really kicked into high gear.
01:30:33 You know, it's just, like...
01:30:36 And Ben and I, the thing was, it was mostly passive-aggressive
01:30:40 in my family.
01:30:41 Like, the biggest grievance I have with my family growing up
01:30:44 was that, like, I was sad we didn't, like,
01:30:46 do more stuff together.
01:30:47 And I was, like, lonely in my room.
01:30:49 That's, like, my biggest, like, I don't know,
01:30:52 thing I didn't like about growing up
01:30:53 that I remember the least fondly.
01:30:55 Like, I wish we'd gone out and, like, done more stuff together.
01:30:59 So, like, would that just create this, like,
01:31:00 weird passive-aggressiveness of, like,
01:31:02 everyone would be in their room,
01:31:03 and I'd just be, like, lonely, sitting in mine,
01:31:05 like, wishing we could, like, hang out and do stuff.
01:31:07 But, like, when you're, like, a kid,
01:31:08 and, like, your older brother is, like, doing his own stuff,
01:31:10 it's, you know, it's just, like, of course,
01:31:12 he's gonna be hanging out with his friends,
01:31:14 not his little brother.
01:31:15 That's gay.
01:31:16 You know, I'm sure I felt the same way
01:31:18 about my little sister, too.
01:31:19 So the cycle continues, and will continue forever.
01:31:22 So...
01:31:23 But occasionally, Ben and I would get mad,
01:31:25 and I remember running from Ben while he chased me
01:31:27 quite a few times.
01:31:29 And, you know, just doing whatever I could
01:31:32 to avoid this rain of blows.
01:31:33 Imagine that today.
01:31:34 Nate running from Ben.
01:31:36 I know.
01:31:36 Now Ben has learned to fear me and laugh.
01:31:41 Yeah, that's all I got.
01:31:43 I just remembered in terms of talking
01:31:45 about the fighting thing.
01:31:47 I think I've heard this, again, not confirmed to be true,
01:31:51 but little kids don't feel pain quite as much as adults do,
01:31:55 because I'm guessing it's because, you know,
01:31:57 they're in the stage of, like, learning and whatnot.
01:31:59 So, you know, they're supposed to, like,
01:32:01 get scuffs and scrapes and whatnot.
01:32:03 So pain isn't registered so much,
01:32:07 or at least it's not that big of a deal to little kids.
01:32:10 That's why I was so...
01:32:11 Maybe.
01:32:12 Maybe that's why I was so rowdy when I was a little kid,
01:32:15 because pain didn't scare me as much.
01:32:18 Mages confirmed for a row.
01:32:20 Listen to this question from AJ Shoup.
01:32:26 All right, get ready for this one.
01:32:28 Brace for impact.
01:32:29 You're fighting a dude slash gal
01:32:31 who is evenly matched with you,
01:32:32 and they straight up poop on their fucking hand,
01:32:35 smear it in, and get back into fighting form.
01:32:38 Do you continue with the shit show,
01:32:41 or choose to lose the fight?
01:32:43 What do you do?
01:32:44 It depends entirely on the stakes.
01:32:47 Yeah.
01:32:47 The smart man would run, or, like, just...
01:32:50 No, like, I don't...
01:32:51 Okay, like, sometimes it's okay to admit defeat.
01:32:55 I don't want poopy on my hand.
01:32:57 I don't want poopy on my face.
01:32:58 Right.
01:32:59 No way.
01:33:00 No, sir.
01:33:00 I feel...
01:33:01 Did this come from personal experience?
01:33:02 Is this, like...
01:33:04 This is an oddly specific question.
01:33:07 I'm just saying.
01:33:09 It is quite specific.
01:33:09 I feel like he might be the aggressor in this case as well.
01:33:12 I can say that I would...
01:33:13 I would basically do anything to avoid contact
01:33:18 in this situation.
01:33:19 I would not let that happen.
01:33:21 That is so disgusting.
01:33:22 Oh, my God.
01:33:24 All right, I now know how to beat all of you in a fight.
01:33:27 Noted.
01:33:28 That's true.
01:33:28 That's true.
01:33:29 Like, I mean, could you live down the fact
01:33:32 that you pooped in your hand to win?
01:33:33 Depending on what I needed to get done,
01:33:35 and how badly I need to beat you,
01:33:37 I might have to...
01:33:38 Mistakes might have to be made.
01:33:39 Do you remember that...
01:33:40 This reminds me, like, it's like a game of chicken.
01:33:42 You remember that fight in, like, the last season of Game of Thrones,
01:33:44 where Theon, like, is exerting dominance?
01:33:47 And, like, this big boy, this big other, you know,
01:33:49 Iron Islands guy, like, he's trying to, like, take over.
01:33:53 Theon's trying to become a man at last.
01:33:54 And so this guy, like, punches him.
01:33:55 He falls down.
01:33:56 He gets back up.
01:33:57 The dude's, like, stay down, punches him.
01:33:58 He falls back down again.
01:33:59 Theon gets back up.
01:34:00 He won't stay down.
01:34:01 He keeps getting up.
01:34:02 Imagine if the man had dropped Trow, pooped on his hand,
01:34:05 and then said, like, what now, Theon?
01:34:07 What now?
01:34:08 Theon would have wilted, like, a fucking flower, you know?
01:34:11 Like, a flower in winter.
01:34:12 But no, he didn't take it to that level.
01:34:15 Theon probably would have done that, though,
01:34:17 because he would do whatever it takes.
01:34:19 He doesn't have much further to fall at this point, you know?
01:34:21 That's true.
01:34:22 That's very true.
01:34:23 Okay, done with that.
01:34:25 Next question.
01:34:26 You know what?
01:34:27 This is kind of just a public service announcement, actually.
01:34:29 Oblivion Fall here.
01:34:31 This is, okay, says,
01:34:32 Is there a deadline for the PCP intro contest?
01:34:35 I've had something written for a while,
01:34:36 but I'm having trouble getting musicians together,
01:34:39 and Fiverr is giving me trouble with PayPal.
01:34:41 I don't want to miss out.
01:34:43 This guy is getting serious about this shit.
01:34:45 I feel like if there is a deadline,
01:34:47 I want to give him an extension,
01:34:48 just because I want to see where this madness leads.
01:34:50 I feel the same way.
01:34:52 I don't know.
01:34:52 I don't really want to put a deadline into place,
01:34:54 but I feel like it would actually be helpful to do that.
01:34:56 I feel like we definitely should put a deadline.
01:34:59 We'll just get answers for everything.
01:35:00 But it shouldn't be soon.
01:35:01 It wouldn't be soon.
01:35:03 Maybe like a month?
01:35:03 Like a month?
01:35:05 From today?
01:35:05 From now?
01:35:06 Maybe a month when this episode goes live.
01:35:08 The end of the summer?
01:35:09 I mean, just have it be like a summer?
01:35:10 End of the summer.
01:35:11 You know, I really don't want to make it stretch out too long.
01:35:14 Like maybe we could say,
01:35:15 what if we said the end of July,
01:35:17 which is a month and a half basically?
01:35:18 I'm chill with that.
01:35:20 Okay, that's fair.
01:35:21 All right, guys, you heard it.
01:35:22 We are assigning a deadline right now.
01:35:24 July 31st is the final date.
01:35:26 That is the last day we are accepting applications.
01:35:28 If you send something,
01:35:30 August 1st, it will not be accepted.
01:35:32 We will not put it in the ranking.
01:35:34 It will not win.
01:35:35 July 31st, there's your fucking deadline.
01:35:37 It's in stone.
01:35:38 Don't forget to actually post it.
01:35:40 There you go.
01:35:40 Because, you know, some people...
01:35:41 Don't forget to post it.
01:35:43 If you send it,
01:35:43 if you've finished it July 1st,
01:35:45 and you forget to send that shit till August 1st,
01:35:47 you're banned.
01:35:48 And don't forget to use the hashtag.
01:35:49 Use that hashtag PCP theme, people.
01:35:51 You've got to use that so we can see it.
01:35:52 That's how we're looking for them.
01:35:53 So if you don't hashtag it, we don't see it.
01:35:56 Nate, Nate, I meant you.
01:35:57 Don't forget to post it on Twitter and stuff.
01:36:00 Because, you know, some people might want...
01:36:01 Yeah, if you posted to Twitter,
01:36:02 hashtag PCP theme, you got to do that.
01:36:04 You got to get it to do it in some way.
01:36:06 So, I mean, you could even...
01:36:07 Don't email me.
01:36:08 Give me a link on Twitter.
01:36:09 Do that.
01:36:09 That's what's helpful.
01:36:11 Some people actually did, like, email me links,
01:36:13 and I just asked them to post it on Twitter.
01:36:15 And then they did.
01:36:16 But speaking of which...
01:36:16 It's that way all of us can see it.
01:36:19 That's right.
01:36:19 And so we can easily use it here.
01:36:20 Plus, like, if you give me an MP3, again,
01:36:22 like, we can't listen to one on the show,
01:36:23 you got to give me a link to listen to it
01:36:25 so we can all listen on the show.
01:36:26 And speaking of which,
01:36:27 do we want to do any more questions
01:36:28 or shall we go to our...
01:36:29 I've got a pretty good one.
01:36:30 All right, let's wrap it up.
01:36:31 By Axelran, what is your favorite anime fight?
01:36:35 Oh, for fuck's sake.
01:36:36 That's almost as bad as what's your favorite anime.
01:36:39 Rock Lee vs. Kara is a classic.
01:36:41 You might say it's supposed to be that.
01:36:44 I mean, it's not...
01:36:45 It's not a traditional...
01:36:46 I mean, I don't know,
01:36:47 like, the final moment of Gurren Lagann
01:36:49 is sort of a battle.
01:36:50 Like, that's one of my favorite moments of all time.
01:36:52 Sort of a battle.
01:36:52 It's definitely a battle.
01:36:53 Okay, it's definitely a battle,
01:36:54 but it's not like a normal, like,
01:36:55 slug fest shown in Naruto-style battle.
01:36:58 It's like a mech, you know,
01:36:59 doing something at the size of the fucking universe,
01:37:01 like, continually being broken down
01:37:03 as, like, a guy, like, keeps plunging forward
01:37:05 through the other carriers.
01:37:05 Yeah, it's a hell of a time for shit.
01:37:06 I mean, it's, like, the coolest thing ever.
01:37:08 But I think I'm actually gonna say it if I want, though.
01:37:10 It is basically the coolest thing ever.
01:37:13 Like, Bellamy vs. Luffy in one piece
01:37:16 is definitely one of the greatest...
01:37:17 And again, that's also kind of a subversion of a fight,
01:37:20 but it is one of the most...
01:37:21 Like, I've read so many shounen,
01:37:22 and seen so many shounen fights,
01:37:24 that the subversion with the Bellamy moment
01:37:26 is, to this day, one of the most amazing moments
01:37:29 in all of one piece.
01:37:30 It's unfortunately...
01:37:31 Well, no, I'm just gonna say
01:37:32 that it's one of the best moments ever.
01:37:34 That's all.
01:37:34 It's great.
01:37:35 I don't like fights in media.
01:37:38 Like, it's not like, I don't...
01:37:40 It's not like I'm not against them, it's just...
01:37:42 Nate, you've said that yourself multiple times.
01:37:44 No, it's just like...
01:37:45 I don't like...
01:37:46 I don't like watching the fights.
01:37:50 Like, I don't find them entertaining.
01:37:51 I guess that's what I mean.
01:37:53 You want to be there.
01:37:54 Yeah, she's frustrated.
01:37:55 She can't actually be killing someone right now.
01:37:57 My brain just starts tuning out.
01:37:59 If it drags on for too long,
01:38:01 I stop paying attention to what's happening
01:38:03 because I'm just...
01:38:04 I don't...
01:38:04 I don't...
01:38:05 I don't know why I just don't.
01:38:06 I can't pay attention too long.
01:38:10 As Tom was saying, I actually sort of agree
01:38:12 because the thing with fights that I always say
01:38:14 is that anime fights,
01:38:15 or any fights in any...
01:38:16 including like Game of Thrones, whatever,
01:38:17 I don't really care about the fight.
01:38:21 I care about who is won at the end.
01:38:23 That's like, narratively what matters.
01:38:25 It doesn't really matter how they got there.
01:38:27 But like, fights are just like fun in anime a lot of the time.
01:38:31 I'm like torn on it because like,
01:38:33 I definitely like the spectacle pieces
01:38:34 of like really crazy choreographed fights.
01:38:37 But at the same time, like there's...
01:38:39 I have like a hard limit, you know?
01:38:40 Because eventually, like Dragon Ball Z,
01:38:42 I don't know how I made it through Dragon Ball Z as a kid.
01:38:44 Like, it's so hard.
01:38:45 How did I...
01:38:45 I don't...
01:38:46 How did I...
01:38:47 Wow, it's sorry.
01:38:48 Realization just hit with me.
01:38:51 That's what I like about my girl.
01:38:52 Did you watch Dragon Ball Z, bitch?
01:38:52 I watched Dragon Ball Z.
01:38:54 I cried when they stopped airing it on TV.
01:38:59 I put the date on my phone that I don't have anymore,
01:39:03 exactly the date that they stopped airing,
01:39:05 and I cried and I said,
01:39:06 every year I'll cry on this day.
01:39:09 Damn, dude.
01:39:11 That's incredible.
01:39:12 That's hardcore.
01:39:13 That's so anime.
01:39:15 That is so anime.
01:39:18 My favorite anime fight is from Dragon Ball.
01:39:22 Tension Hand, as it's written in the manga.
01:39:28 No, versus Goku.
01:39:29 Yeah, okay.
01:39:29 But when, you know, Tension Hand was still like a villain,
01:39:33 and Goku was a little boy,
01:39:35 that fight between them is like one of the most...
01:39:38 Like, it's...
01:39:38 I've never seen a reddit.
01:39:40 I gotta do that, man.
01:39:41 You gotta read it.
01:39:42 It is better than Dragon Ball Z in every way.
01:39:44 Dragon Ball, I believe, is infinitely better than DBZ.
01:39:45 Like, by a titanic margin.
01:39:47 Okay, quickly.
01:39:49 The thing is, like, with the fights...
01:39:51 Fuckin' general blue as well.
01:39:52 Holy shit.
01:39:53 I'm gonna Google him.
01:39:53 I don't know who he is.
01:39:54 Yeah, I don't...
01:39:55 Like I said, I don't like watching the fights,
01:39:57 but I do like certain fights,
01:39:59 like, aren't necessarily just pure action.
01:40:02 Like, you know, they pause,
01:40:04 and like, maybe, you know,
01:40:05 have a narration of what's going on,
01:40:08 or something that will what it means,
01:40:09 what this means, and stuff like that.
01:40:10 It's a little hard to explain what exactly.
01:40:14 Do you mean like an ongoing struggle?
01:40:16 I guess, kind of, like...
01:40:18 I guess a fight I like,
01:40:19 not necessarily my favorite,
01:40:20 but one I can actually remember,
01:40:22 was the last few episodes of this anime.
01:40:25 Now I don't remember how The Enemy was called.
01:40:27 It was this anime where, like,
01:40:29 creations came into the real world,
01:40:32 and sort of fought the Hatsune Miku of that world.
01:40:36 What?
01:40:38 Wait, are you talking about...
01:40:39 Is that the one with Saiyan the Cat girl?
01:40:42 You know, no one talking about?
01:40:45 Show by Rock?
01:40:46 No, no, no, no, no.
01:40:46 The anime was like these characters
01:40:50 from animes, mangas, and games, and stuff like that.
01:40:52 They were brought into the real world, quote, unquote.
01:40:56 Is that Gate? Is that Gate?
01:40:58 Is that the one?
01:40:59 Not this and something.
01:41:00 Okay, I don't know.
01:41:00 I'm just fucking guessing.
01:41:01 I don't have any fucking idea.
01:41:02 But yeah, the main antagonist was sort of like
01:41:06 the representation of Hatsune Miku.
01:41:11 Because of the backstories,
01:41:12 and a lot of the characters are resemblance
01:41:14 of other anime characters, or several anime characters.
01:41:17 It was like this little boy that had like a huge mech.
01:41:21 It was like a huge mech pilot,
01:41:23 and there was this girl with red hair,
01:41:25 and she also had a mech,
01:41:26 but she came to the world without the mech.
01:41:28 And it was such a fun anime.
01:41:31 It was an original anime as well.
01:41:32 It doesn't have a manga,
01:41:33 but I think the manga is going to be published.
01:41:37 But yeah, it was a really fun.
01:41:38 It was a really nice anime.
01:41:40 I quite liked it.
01:41:40 The pacing was a little bit off,
01:41:42 but I think it dragged on someplace.
01:41:45 I liked the final battle,
01:41:48 because in the end,
01:41:49 like the Hatsune Miku,
01:41:51 she was like all-powerful,
01:41:53 and they tried to defeat her,
01:41:57 but they couldn't,
01:41:58 and they tried different ways,
01:42:00 and they had all these plans built up,
01:42:02 and the way she got defeated,
01:42:04 in a way, it felt like a cop-out,
01:42:06 at the same time, it felt fitting.
01:42:09 I quite liked it.
01:42:10 I liked the whole segment of them fighting against her,
01:42:15 and losing, and it's just,
01:42:17 I don't know, it was neat.
01:42:20 Fucking Hatsune Miku,
01:42:22 god-level power.
01:42:23 That sounds pretty cool.
01:42:24 I want to watch this,
01:42:25 whatever it is now.
01:42:25 You've been treating me.
01:42:26 She's a god-level meme in real life.
01:42:27 It has my husband in it,
01:42:28 so it's like my husbando,
01:42:31 my guy food.
01:42:32 I liked episode three of Kill La Kill,
01:42:35 Satsuki versus Ryuko.
01:42:36 It was one of those fucking things.
01:42:38 There are so many good fights.
01:42:39 I'm such a sucker for anime fights.
01:42:41 They make me so happy.
01:42:42 I mean, they're so good.
01:42:43 They're really just the coolest thing ever.
01:42:45 I mean, I guess just some off the top of my head,
01:42:48 I really like the ending to Guren Lagin.
01:42:51 G Gundam, that shit was hype as fuck.
01:42:55 I love G Gundam.
01:42:56 I really like, I mean, I've watched this one,
01:42:58 I rewatched the most recently,
01:43:00 is the All Might versus No Move Fight from the first season
01:43:03 of My Hero Academia.
01:43:04 It's so fucking hype.
01:43:04 You just punched him so many times, dude.
01:43:06 It's only three minutes.
01:43:07 It's three minutes,
01:43:08 and it's exactly as long as it needs to be.
01:43:10 It's so nice.
01:43:11 If you want to rewatch the Frieza fight,
01:43:13 it's like seven hours.
01:43:14 You rewatch the All Might versus No Move,
01:43:15 it's three minutes,
01:43:16 and it's fucking tight, and it works, and it's dope.
01:43:19 Oh, and one last one for me, Bellamy versus Luffy.
01:43:23 Indeed.
01:43:24 In the Jaya arc.
01:43:24 So you agree with me.
01:43:25 So that was my, that's why I said it.
01:43:26 Recreators, there we go.
01:43:28 Oh, did you say that?
01:43:28 I did say that exact one, yes.
01:43:30 Sir, and guys, recreators, that's the anime.
01:43:34 Recreators, oh, okay.
01:43:36 I've heard people say that was good.
01:43:37 Also, people say that was shit, but fair enough.
01:43:39 No, it's just as good.
01:43:39 It has my husband in itself, of course it's good.
01:43:42 So it must be good.
01:43:43 Makes sense to me.
01:43:44 By the way, I just want to say that when you mentioned
01:43:47 that General Blue was like the best fight ever, Gib,
01:43:51 I googled General Blue,
01:43:53 and I think that you must definitely be right,
01:43:55 because look at this image.
01:43:56 Please edit this in, sir.
01:43:57 It's in the main chat.
01:43:58 Look at what's happening at this moment
01:44:00 between these two heroic characters.
01:44:02 This is clearly the best shonen fight of all time.
01:44:05 I like where this is going.
01:44:07 This is one of his,
01:44:08 I mean, this is when guns were still useful in Dragon Ball.
01:44:12 Yeah, yeah.
01:44:13 Would that have killed Goku?
01:44:14 Because he's like resistant bullets, isn't he?
01:44:15 That's a shotgun to the face.
01:44:17 He probably would have been hurt, I'm not sure.
01:44:20 Pull the fucking trigger, General Blue.
01:44:22 I want to see a boy die.
01:44:24 Don't quote me on this.
01:44:25 This is during the Red Ribbon Armour, right?
01:44:27 Yeah, that's right.
01:44:27 Yeah, this is the Red Ribbon in general.
01:44:28 Well, at this point, isn't Goku tanking like rocket launchers?
01:44:31 Yeah, yeah, don't quote me on this,
01:44:33 but I think Goku did take a shotgun to the head
01:44:35 and it hurt him like a peace shooter.
01:44:38 Bullets hurt him.
01:44:39 Oh, you know what?
01:44:42 He may have shot it,
01:44:43 and then his head was knocked back
01:44:45 and then he moved his head back like, ow, my nose.
01:44:48 Yeah, like bullets, he feels bullets,
01:44:50 but it's like when we get smacked.
01:44:52 Don't overanalyze it.
01:44:53 Just enjoy it for what it is.
01:44:55 No, no, no, no, this is a serious analysis
01:44:58 of this one frame of Dragon Ball episode 240, whatever.
01:45:02 What a fucking badass, I have to,
01:45:03 I need to go read Dragon Ball.
01:45:05 I've been meaning to for like a fucking decade.
01:45:06 All you gotta do is change his hair to brown.
01:45:07 It's basically you.
01:45:10 Okay, so moving on from there, we're done with questions.
01:45:13 It's time for the PCP theme contest portion of our program here.
01:45:17 So as we said before, hashtag PCP themes,
01:45:21 send us on Twitter using that shit.
01:45:23 I mean, that's really the only way that we'll get them.
01:45:25 If you're in the fucking Discord, the fan Discord,
01:45:28 or the patron Discord, you can submit them there
01:45:30 in like the fan art section, but the Twitter is even easier.
01:45:33 And you gotta give us a link to either a SoundCloud
01:45:36 or a YouTube link, and maybe something else,
01:45:38 but we can't play anything else on the show.
01:45:40 So SoundCloud or YouTube, please, sir.
01:45:43 We got a couple that weren't that, and they had to fix them.
01:45:45 So just letting you know.
01:45:47 All right, so let's see what we got here.
01:45:48 Our first one up here, let's see who's first.
01:45:51 Okay, first is from John J. Renz.
01:45:55 This is a theme called Let's Jack Off.
01:45:59 It's the name of it.
01:45:59 Wait, okay, hang on.
01:46:00 Okay, all right.
01:46:02 And here, we fucking, hang on, go.
01:46:17 Whoa.
01:46:18 You know, this is my genius.
01:46:23 Wait.
01:46:33 Oh, shit.
01:46:39 This is great.
01:46:40 This is an excellent shit.
01:46:44 Oh my god.
01:46:48 Jesus Christ.
01:47:10 I mean, this is, this is pretty great.
01:47:12 I mean, it is.
01:47:12 It's, I feel like his words are like indecipherable.
01:47:17 Oh my god.
01:47:18 Okay, that was incredible.
01:47:20 John J. Renzel.
01:47:23 But like, I really couldn't fucking tell what you were saying.
01:47:27 He did include the lyrics in his SoundCloud link.
01:47:29 So if you, if you go to that here, I'll just paste in the thing here.
01:47:33 You can see like what they were.
01:47:34 I, this was clearly like mostly based on,
01:47:36 wait, I pasted the wrong chat.
01:47:37 This is mostly based on the like, the Jesse's theme that he made.
01:47:41 Correct.
01:47:42 I could tell that much.
01:47:43 I mean, that sounded cool.
01:47:46 There was a lot going on there, but like the fucking,
01:47:50 like, are you a native English speaker, sir?
01:47:52 I love the piano like diddly doodly.
01:47:54 What was that good one?
01:47:55 I love the, the, the, you know, the sort of like, you know,
01:47:59 what's the word to describe the haphazard piano doodly.
01:48:03 Yeah.
01:48:03 Yeah.
01:48:04 That was great.
01:48:08 I'm kind of at a loss for words, uh, after listening to that.
01:48:12 That was so much like fighting.
01:48:14 You can't really respond to that with words.
01:48:16 It's true.
01:48:16 That would act.
01:48:17 It's true.
01:48:18 I mean, could you hear that like being at the beginning of the show?
01:48:21 I think I could.
01:48:22 Good question.
01:48:23 I mean, I'm, I mean, that is pretty good.
01:48:26 I'm leaning towards no personally only because it's so strange.
01:48:31 I like the music.
01:48:33 Like it's really, dude, just like us.
01:48:35 Oh my God.
01:48:36 That's like perfect and stuff.
01:48:38 Uh, I mean, I prefer it to a generic rock beat.
01:48:41 It certainly has personality.
01:48:42 I mean, I agree.
01:48:43 I agree with that.
01:48:46 I'll give you this.
01:48:46 It's definitely better for the next one to be a generic rock beat.
01:48:50 That's way better than like, uh, just the, one of these like boring, like no words.
01:48:54 Like there was way more heart in that.
01:48:56 Um, but it was like kind of just strange and hard to understand what the hell was going on.
01:49:01 And also, I mean, this is totally subjective, but it didn't sound like to me the kind of tone
01:49:07 I would want to like kick off a show.
01:49:09 That's, uh, that, that, that is what I have to say about it, I guess.
01:49:12 But like, none of these are getting like ruled out immediately.
01:49:15 We'll like confer on these just as time goes.
01:49:17 And after we reach the deadline and we'll like listen back.
01:49:19 When we get closer to the deadline, we'll be like, uh, so what are the contenders?
01:49:22 Yeah, we'll probably make a fine.
01:49:23 We'll go over them.
01:49:24 Yeah.
01:49:25 We'll, we'll do something where we like talk about like the final ones and review all the
01:49:29 finalists and stuff and see what was, what's the best one.
01:49:32 Um, and then completely ignore all of them.
01:49:35 Definitely possible.
01:49:37 As just like Digi drops some fire and makes his own theme.
01:49:41 Yes.
01:49:41 Well, okay.
01:49:42 I mean, that's it for that one.
01:49:43 Okay.
01:49:43 Next one is what the fuck is it?
01:49:46 All right.
01:49:47 Themes.
01:49:47 Here we go.
01:49:50 Fucking.
01:49:51 All right.
01:49:51 Hang on.
01:49:52 Okay.
01:49:52 Here we go.
01:49:53 Next theme is from, uh, Das Exemptionist Biggles.
01:49:57 Oh, he's an exceptionist like, like made famous by the PCP in that episode of pyramid schemes.
01:50:03 Remember that one?
01:50:03 I remember that one.
01:50:04 I don't.
01:50:05 I don't.
01:50:05 PC, hashtag, PCPermits scheme.
01:50:07 Still, still in effect.
01:50:08 It's still in effect.
01:50:08 Still give us all your money.
01:50:10 Uh, patreon.com.
01:50:10 Slice the burqrassinators.
01:50:12 Uh, okay.
01:50:12 Here we go.
01:50:18 Okay.
01:50:23 This is an art house, uh, film.
01:50:27 I like it.
01:50:28 Oh, it's called a Das article.
01:50:29 Is the name of the song.
01:50:30 It's German.
01:50:33 Yeah.
01:50:33 Definitely a German boy.
01:50:38 Hmm.
01:50:40 This.
01:50:40 It's interesting.
01:50:42 Oh, is it already going?
01:50:43 It's fading out now, I think.
01:50:47 Oh.
01:50:49 No, it's just getting quiet.
01:50:50 All right.
01:50:50 It's just getting quiet.
01:50:51 That's part of the theme.
01:50:52 It's fading to the words, I guess.
01:50:56 Whoa.
01:50:57 Um, okay.
01:50:58 That was a little, that was a little scribbly scrably for me.
01:51:01 Uh, I agree.
01:51:02 I agree.
01:51:02 It was definitely a little.
01:51:04 Yeah, go on.
01:51:05 Fucking out there, but it also kind of felt PCP-ish to me.
01:51:09 Like that, that.
01:51:11 No, not for an intro to the, to the episode.
01:51:13 It's just, it doesn't want to have this intro, but it definitely,
01:51:16 I felt like it kind of hit on our eclectic.
01:51:19 I do like all these people having.
01:51:20 I definitely like that.
01:51:21 Interpretating the PCP in music and having their own takes on
01:51:26 how the PCP sounds is music.
01:51:28 Me too.
01:51:28 It's really fun.
01:51:29 That's pretty dope.
01:51:31 Yeah.
01:51:31 This, this one definitely felt like like an, an RT like
01:51:35 noise experimental animation or something.
01:51:38 Yeah.
01:51:38 Like I could see like squares and lines like moving across
01:51:41 and going all bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop.
01:51:43 I, yeah, definitely.
01:51:44 Uh, but I, I, I've been generally with, I liked it,
01:51:46 but I'm not sure it works as a theme.
01:51:48 That's, that's what I'm saying.
01:51:49 Uh, okay.
01:51:50 Let's do, let's do one or two more here.
01:51:52 Uh, one's from at Captain Thought One.
01:51:54 Captain Thought One, or whatever, Captain Thought.
01:51:57 Uh, this is one called, uh, this is called Cursed Video.
01:52:01 Cursed, or Cursed Videos.
01:52:03 Okay, here we go.
01:52:04 Let's see what you got, Captain Thought.
01:52:06 Welcome to the PCP.
01:52:08 Grab your boys and grab some beans.
01:52:11 Hope nobody interrupts me.
01:52:13 Ben is always squeaky clean.
01:52:18 Is that it?
01:52:20 Okay.
01:52:20 Just said prep training.
01:52:23 I did like that, to grab some beans.
01:52:25 Now the old, okay.
01:52:25 Here's what I'll say about that.
01:52:27 If you, if you, if you mentioned specific things about like
01:52:31 individual members of the PCP, I immediately have a problem.
01:52:34 If you only mentioned like two people and nobody else,
01:52:37 you know what I mean?
01:52:38 It's like, I feel like there should either be like
01:52:41 group references, uh, or it should be like everyone gets a mention.
01:52:45 You think, you know what I mean?
01:52:46 You think of like the anime openings, like you always have
01:52:49 all the characters come across, uh, with their face at least once,
01:52:53 at least a little bit.
01:52:53 That's, yeah, that's how I feel about that.
01:52:56 Also, that was definitely, uh, not hype enough to be an intro theme song.
01:53:00 But, uh, I appreciate the work.
01:53:02 Thanks, buddy.
01:53:03 Let's see.
01:53:04 Tom, any thoughts?
01:53:05 Any thoughts?
01:53:06 Uh, plus one for bean reference.
01:53:08 But yeah, I agree with what you said about it.
01:53:10 But that, I did like beans.
01:53:12 Beans are good.
01:53:13 Okay.
01:53:13 You know what?
01:53:14 There's three more.
01:53:14 I'm having a great time.
01:53:15 Let's just listen to the next three.
01:53:17 Let's fucking go for it.
01:53:17 Yeah.
01:53:18 Let's go for it.
01:53:19 All right.
01:53:19 Let's, let me pull this up.
01:53:20 Okay.
01:53:20 This is from Augie Main.
01:53:23 And it's called, I just want to die.
01:53:25 Same.
01:53:26 Oh God.
01:53:27 This is a PCP theme, not my theme.
01:53:29 What the fuck?
01:53:29 Yeah, I know, right?
01:53:30 Okay.
01:53:31 Here we go.
01:53:33 Play now.
01:53:40 Okay.
01:53:41 It's like Ape Escape.
01:53:42 Is that what that is?
01:53:44 No, it's, it sounds like an Ape Escape song.
01:53:51 Maybe a bit chiller than Ape Escape.
01:53:55 This is quite chilly.
01:53:56 Ooh, I gotta put on a sweater.
01:54:03 Okay.
01:54:10 Hilarious.
01:54:12 And then he died.
01:54:13 I loved it.
01:54:14 Then he died at the end.
01:54:15 I liked it.
01:54:15 I liked it too.
01:54:16 I feel, I feel, I feel kinship to it.
01:54:19 Yeah.
01:54:20 Yeah.
01:54:20 I mean, I liked it, but you know.
01:54:21 It's like hype enough.
01:54:22 The hype, not what I'm looking for,
01:54:24 not what I'm looking for.
01:54:25 And that could be like the intro to like,
01:54:28 hello and welcome to the suicide cast.
01:54:30 That's true.
01:54:31 That's true.
01:54:32 That's tall.
01:54:33 I'd use that as an outro theme for Wine Chamber.
01:54:36 Makes sense.
01:54:36 Yeah.
01:54:37 That'd be good.
01:54:37 That'd be good.
01:54:38 Yeah, definitely.
01:54:39 I wonder if these guys would mind if we just like
01:54:41 use these for other stuff.
01:54:43 Probably not.
01:54:43 I don't know.
01:54:44 Ask me if that's okay.
01:54:45 I love the creativity here.
01:54:46 Yeah.
01:54:47 I mean, I think I said something about like,
01:54:50 we don't have to use any of these if we don't like them.
01:54:52 We should also add a clause to like,
01:54:54 but we can use them for whatever we want.
01:54:55 They, oh, we own them now.
01:54:57 I do.
01:54:58 If you tweet us with that hashtag, it's over.
01:54:59 You signed away all your rights by using the hashtag.
01:55:02 That's right.
01:55:03 They signed their rights away as soon as they opened Episode 1.
01:55:06 They just haven't realized it yet.
01:55:06 That's true.
01:55:07 That's definitely true.
01:55:09 I did love that one, but it was more of an outro than an intro.
01:55:12 Yeah.
01:55:13 Yeah.
01:55:14 Well, I definitely thought that was cool and chill.
01:55:16 I like it.
01:55:16 I do like it.
01:55:17 For a theme, for an opening theme.
01:55:19 It sounded like a Steven Universe song playing in the distance.
01:55:22 Whoa.
01:55:23 Yeah, it did.
01:55:23 That is on point.
01:55:25 Yes.
01:55:25 Totally true.
01:55:26 You know those meme videos that are like,
01:55:28 Redbone, but it's playing one room over.
01:55:31 And it's all like muffled sounding.
01:55:33 I remember that.
01:55:33 It's kind of like, I love that.
01:55:35 It's like, it's like Steven listening in on his dad saying,
01:55:37 oh, just from a guy like, dad, no.
01:55:42 Okay.
01:55:42 What do we got here?
01:55:43 Another one from Robert J. Lazarus.
01:55:45 And this is called PCP Theme RJL.
01:55:49 All right then.
01:55:50 Here we go.
01:55:51 What do you got for us, Rob?
01:55:59 Okay.
01:56:01 By the way, wait, what?
01:56:09 Do you say Ben's usually wrong about most things?
01:56:13 Because if you notice, the album cover for this is Ben's face with the words PCP just all around it.
01:56:19 Amazing.
01:56:19 Oh, amazing.
01:56:20 If you go to the Robote Nazi Techno state thing where I'm playing all the bots,
01:56:24 you can see the album covers for like each of these.
01:56:27 They're pretty.
01:56:27 Maybe we should edit these in.
01:56:29 I don't know.
01:56:29 I did last time.
01:56:30 I'll edit them in.
01:56:31 Oh, you did?
01:56:32 Oh, that'd be cool.
01:56:32 That'd be cool then.
01:56:33 This Ben, I really love this Ben's face.
01:56:36 This whole thing is excellent.
01:56:38 What an expression.
01:56:40 What a face of disdain.
01:56:43 I'm not going to bullshit it, Rob.
01:56:44 That was a little amateurish for a professional operation like the PCP here.
01:56:48 We're looking for a little bit higher standards.
01:56:51 I mean, I could tell that was the point.
01:56:53 Just like, Ben sucks.
01:56:55 Like that was the thing.
01:56:56 Yeah.
01:56:56 I mean, I did love that.
01:56:58 Message received, man.
01:56:59 Message received.
01:57:01 Hardly agreed with.
01:57:03 Okay.
01:57:04 And we got one more here.
01:57:05 And this guy submitted actually 36 minutes after we started recording.
01:57:09 Oh, this is some cool album cover.
01:57:11 It's like, oh fuck, stop, stop.
01:57:13 This is like, I mean, you'll see when I paste it there.
01:57:15 It's like this blue version of the PCP boys.
01:57:18 Oh, I think you actually redrew them.
01:57:20 Okay, whatever.
01:57:20 Let me paste this shit.
01:57:21 So this is from Artur.
01:57:23 Artur, I believe his name.
01:57:25 And this is PCP theme demo.
01:57:28 All right.
01:57:28 Here we go.
01:57:31 Begin.
01:57:36 Oh.
01:57:38 Ooh.
01:57:39 Okay.
01:57:52 Yeah.
01:57:58 Okay.
01:58:07 All right.
01:58:07 I did not understand a single word.
01:58:10 But that was hype.
01:58:12 That was hype.
01:58:12 I want to go back and look at the words.
01:58:14 They're not posted on the SoundCloud, but that was pretty sick.
01:58:16 That's yeah.
01:58:17 And I like the mixing.
01:58:19 I like the voice, how it sounded compared to the guitar.
01:58:22 And I like the thumbnail.
01:58:23 This guy put some work into this.
01:58:26 Yeah.
01:58:27 Good.
01:58:27 Yeah.
01:58:27 If I knew the lyrics, I mean, I don't really care to know what the lyrics are,
01:58:33 as long as it sounds pretty cool.
01:58:34 I'm serious though.
01:58:34 But I would like them to be like, understand them.
01:58:36 Yeah, I'm a lyric.
01:58:37 That is true.
01:58:37 He says this is a demo, so he might be able to like, make it better.
01:58:41 That's true.
01:58:42 If I have any criteria at all for like the opening, what I always look for like,
01:58:48 it wouldn't be startling and it wouldn't hurt people's ears.
01:58:52 That's what I usually look for.
01:58:54 And this is both startling and with
01:58:57 probably be a little obnoxious to listen to.
01:59:00 I mean, I like the way it sounds, but like as soon as it starts playing,
01:59:04 I feel like if I was a listener, I would just probably want to click away.
01:59:10 We shouldn't forget that the PCB is a cold-blooded capitalist engine.
01:59:14 It's a cold machine for profit exclusively.
01:59:18 So we're looking to appeal to that mass demographic on a wide audience.
01:59:22 If that's our game plan, we've got a lot of adjustments we're going to make.
01:59:26 It's true.
01:59:28 We're going to have to fire everyone.
01:59:30 All of us will be fired immediately.
01:59:32 Only the logo will live on.
01:59:35 Yeah, well, I don't know.
01:59:36 I liked it, but I do think, I mean, this is a demo.
01:59:40 I don't know if there was an updated version.
01:59:44 I don't know if I'm alone in this,
01:59:45 but I would be interested in hearing an instrumental version as well.
01:59:49 Yeah.
01:59:50 Well, I mean, my favorite part about this is like the difference between like the guitar
01:59:54 and the voices.
01:59:55 You work well together, too.
01:59:58 I like it.
01:59:58 I'm curious.
01:59:59 It's well produced or whatever the word is.
02:00:02 I want some more development on this.
02:00:04 I want some dialogue.
02:00:05 I want some refinements.
02:00:06 I want the demo dropped, and I want the final dropped in,
02:00:09 and I want to check back and want to see how it goes.
02:00:11 I want some diagetic music that is like it's real.
02:00:16 And we are singing it every time.
02:00:19 Every time we record, it's like it's...
02:00:22 A catchy melody.
02:00:22 And this didn't put much emphasis on the melody,
02:00:25 you know, as a hip hopper type track.
02:00:28 It does feel a bit like a digi thing,
02:00:30 or like not as a digi.
02:00:32 I mean, I don't even mind this.
02:00:35 Like I could see myself using something along these lines,
02:00:37 but I don't know.
02:00:40 It's pretty good.
02:00:41 Pretty good.
02:00:41 That's what I say.
02:00:42 Pretty good.
02:00:42 That is pretty good.
02:00:43 I'll definitely keep this one in mind as we progress.
02:00:47 All right.
02:00:47 You got one more?
02:00:49 That was the last one.
02:00:50 Oh, that was the last one.
02:00:51 All right, we're good.
02:00:52 We're fucking...
02:00:52 We did it.
02:00:52 So we're all done with the fucking PCP themes.
02:00:55 So we'll keep them coming, people.
02:00:56 July 31st, Harry Potter's birthday.
02:00:59 That's on purpose.
02:01:01 That's the finale.
02:01:02 Voldemort killed Harry on that day.
02:01:04 Who will be the PCP boy who lived?
02:01:07 And their theme?
02:01:08 Exactly.
02:01:08 Only one of you get to live.
02:01:10 It's the one we choose to put the theme.
02:01:11 The rest of you are murdered by Voldemort, a.k.a.
02:01:14 Much.
02:01:14 A.k.a. Davoo.
02:01:15 Mage.
02:01:15 Oh, right, Mage.
02:01:16 That's true.
02:01:17 All right.
02:01:18 Well, the last part of our fucking show here
02:01:20 is due to the little fan art corner.
02:01:21 So let's see what we got here.
02:01:23 Let's take a look over at our fucking fan art.
02:01:25 We got a couple good ones.
02:01:27 We got this first one by Link's.
02:01:29 Oh, yes.
02:01:30 Now, Davoo asks us to read a statement regarding this.
02:01:35 Davoo says that this depiction of him is in his top 20
02:01:40 of Davoo depictions, and he really likes it.
02:01:43 And this art style is cool.
02:01:45 And I agree with Davoo.
02:01:46 It is very fucking sick.
02:01:47 Yeah, it's got a good aesthetic.
02:01:49 I do like it.
02:01:50 I do like it.
02:01:51 I like how Munch is sort of like doing a weird stance
02:01:54 and wistfully looking off into the distance.
02:01:56 It feels very album-focused.
02:01:57 Oh, yeah, it does.
02:01:58 It does.
02:01:58 Now that you mention it, yeah.
02:02:00 I wonder if it's based on, oh, maybe not.
02:02:02 Also, I love the Kirby face.
02:02:04 It's just kind of floating there.
02:02:06 I like how the Kirby face is so happy,
02:02:08 as opposed to everyone else looking so mellow.
02:02:11 Right.
02:02:12 Everyone else is very melancholy.
02:02:13 That album cover, Disinterest, Don't Want to Be Here,
02:02:16 but Buy Your Shit kind of thing.
02:02:18 Gibbs Lyons being there is looking pretty good as well.
02:02:21 It's pretty dope.
02:02:22 Oh, yeah.
02:02:23 That's a zero out of 10, because I'm out there.
02:02:25 Oh, no.
02:02:28 All right.
02:02:29 What do we got?
02:02:29 Now, we got one that was just munchy,
02:02:31 but it was just munchy, so banned.
02:02:33 Remember, people, it's got to be either,
02:02:35 like, if it's one of us,
02:02:36 it's got to be PCP-related in some way
02:02:39 that's clearly communicable.
02:02:41 Like, maybe Munchy and his gesture outfit
02:02:43 that he wore at his lecture, that I could see.
02:02:46 If it's just munchy, though.
02:02:47 What if we just got all fanartididgy?
02:02:49 You know, like, nobody wants that.
02:02:51 Nobody wants that.
02:02:53 Or me, or Gib, or anybody.
02:02:56 PCP, PCP themes.
02:02:57 That's the thing.
02:02:59 But so, look at this one.
02:03:00 From I'm a Big Boy Yeah, Caleb Adams.
02:03:04 Okay, now, these are fascinating.
02:03:06 So, it's me and Munchy, drawn individually,
02:03:08 only it's drawn on those weird,
02:03:11 like, children magnetic-filling draw paths.
02:03:15 The, yeah.
02:03:16 I don't know how those work.
02:03:18 I don't know whether it's, like,
02:03:19 iron filings.
02:03:20 It probably isn't.
02:03:20 It's sort of, like, you push down,
02:03:23 and, like, the contact of the top layer
02:03:25 and the bottom layer creates a line.
02:03:26 Yeah.
02:03:27 But, like, you have to, like, shake the thing,
02:03:29 to, like, make them go away, or something like that.
02:03:31 Right, yeah.
02:03:32 It's pretty...
02:03:32 I mean...
02:03:33 No, no, I think what it is,
02:03:35 it's one of those, like, it's, like, a vacuum almost,
02:03:37 and then you, like, twist a knob and it lets air in.
02:03:39 No, it's not a vacuum. They have, like, a little handle
02:03:41 with the magnet thing, and it wipes it clean.
02:03:42 Like, you, like, you swoop, you squish it down,
02:03:44 and it wipes it away.
02:03:45 Oh, yeah.
02:03:46 Yeah, I think he's right.
02:03:46 I think he's right.
02:03:47 Yeah.
02:03:47 Yeah.
02:03:48 Well, whatever, man.
02:03:49 I don't fucking know.
02:03:50 They're fucking sick.
02:03:51 It's all bad.
02:03:51 I know that I'm looking at angry as fuck,
02:03:53 probably for excellent reason.
02:03:55 Someone has wronged me this day.
02:03:57 Maybe Ben looked at me,
02:03:58 and I, he challenged my authority.
02:03:59 I mean, I have to destroy him.
02:04:00 The fact that he drew both you and Munchie,
02:04:02 it seems to be, like, you got mad at Munchie,
02:04:05 and then crucified it.
02:04:06 I crucified it.
02:04:07 No, he's dead.
02:04:07 I think Munchie crucified himself to save us all.
02:04:09 That's what I think happened.
02:04:11 And, like, how, like, square, and, like,
02:04:14 it's all sharp and pointy your images,
02:04:16 but, like, Munchie's, like, a soft, round boy.
02:04:19 Munchie's just all wiggly wobbly.
02:04:21 I think this is an angry, distraught,
02:04:25 Nate looking at his life companion,
02:04:29 Munchie J. Trump, on the cross,
02:04:31 and he's put his shades on
02:04:33 to hide his single tear of regret.
02:04:35 Oh, you know, you're probably right.
02:04:37 You're probably right.
02:04:38 And again, I just love the fucking gizomed
02:04:42 of Munchie crucified on the cross
02:04:44 with that happy-smiling Kirby shirt.
02:04:47 It's truly transcendent.
02:04:48 I absolutely love it.
02:04:49 It literally is.
02:04:52 Well, team, I think we've reached the end
02:04:54 of our show for today.
02:04:55 Hope you had a heck of a time.

02:05:47 Last one's sitcoms, it was incredible.
02:05:49 It was the best one.
02:05:50 The best episode of the PCP, basically.
02:05:52 In terms of editing, for sure.
02:05:53 Yeah.
02:05:54 Divu went crazy.
02:05:55 He edited like a sitcom.
02:05:57 It was so good.
02:05:58 It was so good.
02:05:59 Audience laughter and all that cool stuff.

02:06:33 I'm supposed to be working right now.
02:06:39 But I'm not working.
02:06:41 I'm doing nothing.
02:06:44 My dick, I'm jerking.
02:06:47 Myself, I'm sucking.
02:06:49 I am an asshole.
02:06:52 I am a stupid.
02:06:55 I've got a deadline.
02:06:57 Don't want to do it.
02:07:03 What the hell is wrong with me?
