00:00:00 Donald J. Trump is now president of the United States.
00:00:03 Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:12 I am the best guy in the motherfucking game.
00:00:16 And I'm here once again with all your favorite internet shenanigan boys.
00:00:21 Here's Hippocrit.
00:00:22 Everybody is a human being.
00:00:26 But some are gayer than others.
00:00:28 Mumkey Jones is here.
00:00:29 I just saw the Japanese film Your Name in theaters, and then I went and watched The
00:00:33 Pleeve and the Weep episode, and I thought it was very funny and well-edited.
00:00:37 Oh, well, go on to, uh...
00:00:39 It's only we knew the name of the genius who edited those episodes.
00:00:43 Who could have?
00:00:44 It's only he had a Patreon.com slash Endless Jess that we should know about.
00:00:50 You have co-opped this intro segment.
00:00:53 It's garbage now.
00:00:54 Endless Jess is here as well, as you heard.
00:00:56 I'm wearing slippers.
00:00:59 Nice.
00:01:00 Tom Oliver.
00:01:01 Sup?
00:01:02 Uh, yeah.
00:01:03 I'm here.
00:01:04 He's not on the podcast.
00:01:05 I'm just asking him what's up.
00:01:06 I got nothing.
00:01:07 He's in the room.
00:01:08 He's in the room.
00:01:09 I'm eating my blue pills.
00:01:10 I'm eating my blue pills.
00:01:11 I'm eating my blue pills.
00:01:12 Is he saying he's eating his blue pills?
00:01:13 I'm eating my blue pills.
00:01:14 What on earth else could he be eating?
00:01:15 That's a good question.
00:01:16 I'm hoarding those blue pills.
00:01:17 You son of a bitch.
00:01:18 Leave some for me.
00:01:19 I'm eating my blue pills.
00:01:20 Oh my god.
00:01:21 In that new Rick and Morty episode, is that what they were feeling?
00:01:22 What on earth else could he be eating?
00:01:23 What on earth else could he be eating?
00:01:24 That's a good question.
00:01:28 Are we feeding everyone?
00:01:29 Is that the pills that everyone was surviving on?
00:01:30 Oh my god.
00:01:31 And Ben St.
00:01:32 The most blue pill man the world is here.
00:01:34 That's right.
00:01:35 I'm here to show y'all how it's done.
00:01:37 Because today's topic is SJWs.
00:01:40 Uh-oh.
00:01:41 It's a spicy topic.
00:01:42 It's a heated topic.
00:01:43 It's gonna get crazy.
00:01:45 This will be the end of the PCP.
00:01:47 Most likely it'll terrace in Twayne and will never be whole again.
00:01:51 Today's special episode has not one, but two,
00:01:56 urban dictionary definitions that we're reading,
00:01:59 which means you have to go to patreon.com
00:02:01 slash the procrastinators and double your Patreon amount.
00:02:03 I find the term urban is totally rad, so keep going.
00:02:08 I thought you were gonna say racist as a SJW.
00:02:11 Way to explain the joke, Nate.
00:02:14 I fucked it up.
00:02:16 Well, rad is a very white word as far as I'm concerned.
00:02:18 Read your fucking definition.
00:02:21 Here is what he's the definition of SJW.
00:02:23 Social justice warrior, a pejorative term for an individual
00:02:27 who repeatedly and vehemently engages in arguments
00:02:30 on social justice on the internet,
00:02:32 often in a shallow or not well thought out way
00:02:35 for the purpose of raising their own personal reputation.
00:02:38 And that's the important part.
00:02:39 And here's the special bonus definition today,
00:02:42 because I thought it behooved us to define specifically
00:02:46 social justice itself, to be a little clear
00:02:48 as to what we're talking about here.
00:02:49 So here is the urban dictionary definition
00:02:51 for social justice, promoting tolerance, freedom,
00:02:55 and equality for all people regardless of race, sex,
00:02:58 orientation, national origin, handicap, et cetera,
00:03:02 except for white straight cisgendered males.
00:03:04 Fuck those guys, they're overprivileged no matter what.
00:03:06 That's true.
00:03:07 That's the deal, that's where we're starting.
00:03:09 I wanna start off by saying I don't agree
00:03:10 with that definition of social justice.
00:03:12 It's a meme.
00:03:13 It's a joke.
00:03:14 Yeah, so everything except the fuck white guys.
00:03:18 Ben does agree with that, though.
00:03:19 He's like, yeah, that's me, that's me, right, Ben?
00:03:22 As a cis white male, I know that I deserve no rights
00:03:25 and no consideration.
00:03:26 Good, good, good, good.
00:03:28 Yes.
00:03:29 You there, boy, what day is it?
00:03:32 Why is Mon Luther King Day, sir?
00:03:36 Mon Luther King Day, bring me some social justice.
00:03:42 Here's a tuppence, my lord.
00:03:45 For the sake of organization,
00:03:47 I think we should start off
00:03:48 when everybody goes around the horn and says,
00:03:50 you know, what's your stance on social justice warriors?
00:03:53 That's a good way to start.
00:03:54 Probably evolve a debate from that.
00:03:56 That's probably a good call.
00:03:58 Monkey, why don't you start us off?
00:04:00 Well, I think it's no secret that I'm not a fan.
00:04:04 Yeah, okay, I'm a racist, it's fine.
00:04:06 I'm also a sexist, a misogynist.
00:04:08 Just anyist that's negative, you can say I am.
00:04:11 So I'm pretty much against the idea of,
00:04:16 the social justice warrior who like innate definitions,
00:04:20 who was very loud and obnoxious,
00:04:22 but in a way where it's hypocritical,
00:04:24 not in the good hippo way,
00:04:26 but how are the good gibbon way, I should say,
00:04:28 but in the way where they want equality in quotes
00:04:32 and their version of equality
00:04:33 is special treatment for people like me
00:04:36 and disregard the issues of others.
00:04:38 That's what I think the modern day
00:04:40 social justice warrior is.
00:04:41 Can I insert my little definition in there?
00:04:44 I was reading about it ahead of time
00:04:46 just to make sure I was sort of up to snuff
00:04:48 on sort of the more accurate definition.
00:04:50 And it's kind of this Leninist, Communist sort of idea
00:04:55 in terms of society where there is,
00:04:57 the goal is an equality of outcome for all
00:04:59 in terms of society, as opposed to eliminating the barriers.
00:05:03 No, it is equality of outcome.
00:05:04 That's what it's about.
00:05:05 Equality of outcome in terms of society
00:05:07 in a social context, which necessitates
00:05:10 a large degree of control on people
00:05:12 to force the people above down
00:05:14 and lift the people below up to get the same right.
00:05:17 Okay, so that's-
00:05:17 Social Marxism as the buzzword is.
00:05:21 Yeah, yeah.
00:05:22 I like Leninist though,
00:05:23 because it makes me sound smart.
00:05:23 It does sound cooler, I'll give you that.
00:05:27 Okay, monkey, have any further?
00:05:29 I have a lot more to say, but I'll save it for later.
00:05:32 Okay.
00:05:33 How about you, Munchy?
00:05:33 What are you, where are you at, brother?
00:05:35 You're Californian, so you're gay, right?
00:05:37 I'm a Californian.
00:05:38 One time, Bernie Sanders actually ate my poop.
00:05:42 He actually came into my house
00:05:44 and he actually ate my poop,
00:05:46 so that changed my fucking life.
00:05:48 Were you that bird that landed on his podium that one time?
00:05:51 Was that you?
00:05:52 Yeah.
00:05:53 Okay, cool.
00:05:54 If we're gonna be serious about Bernie,
00:05:56 I actually shook that man's hand.
00:05:58 It was an honorable moment in my life.
00:05:59 Really?
00:06:00 What was that?
00:06:01 He came to my college.
00:06:01 What?
00:06:03 I stopped trying to call it my social movement, Munchy.
00:06:05 Anyway, I think, while their efforts are noble,
00:06:10 they're debatably noble.
00:06:13 No, they're fucking noble, they're great.
00:06:15 However, they're also bad.
00:06:16 Well, they are mean, and I don't like that part of it.
00:06:22 So you think that they got their hearts in the right place,
00:06:25 but their tactics are mistaken?
00:06:29 Their tactics are that of a fucking boy.
00:06:33 I hate boys.
00:06:34 Uh-oh.
00:06:36 Yeah, that's a no-no.
00:06:38 How about Tom?
00:06:39 What do you think about all this?
00:06:41 I think my opinion is probably pretty close
00:06:43 to what Munchy was talking about.
00:06:45 I'm really not a huge fan of the hypocrisy of the movement
00:06:48 and the people in general.
00:06:49 There seems to be a lot of, instead of raising people up,
00:06:53 it's trying to push people at the top down.
00:06:55 Right.
00:06:56 And just like, I think this way about one thing,
00:06:59 but not about the other thing,
00:07:00 and I'm sure I can probably get into specifics
00:07:01 as the debate will continue.
00:07:03 I'm not a huge fan of social justice warriors.
00:07:05 It's interesting, back in 2012, 2013,
00:07:07 I was more on board with it
00:07:09 because I just kind of heard the service arguments
00:07:11 and it seemed to make sense,
00:07:13 but the more I digged into it,
00:07:14 the more I realized that a lot of it was bullshit
00:07:16 and based on false arguments.
00:07:18 So now I'm definitely more on the red pill side of things,
00:07:22 but I'm not super invested in any of it.
00:07:25 It's just kind of what I hear and stuff.
00:07:28 Yeah, so it's done.
00:07:31 Jesse, what are you saying?
00:07:33 Well, the PCP has slowly morphed over the years
00:07:37 or the last year into more and more
00:07:39 of the Jesse is Right podcast.
00:07:41 And I think this episode is going to be the most
00:07:44 Jesse is Right episode in quite some time.
00:07:49 Because everybody's wrong about social justice warriors.
00:07:51 Everybody's wrong about what a social justice warrior is.
00:07:54 Everybody has an idea in their head
00:07:55 of what a social justice warrior is.
00:07:57 And most of us picture the militant left,
00:08:01 but I say the term needs to be expanded
00:08:03 in people's minds to encompass people
00:08:05 on both sides of the extremist fucking spectrum.
00:08:08 Because I think if you're the kind of person
00:08:10 who is up in arms about social justice warriors,
00:08:12 then you are yourself a social justice warrior.
00:08:15 You're all the same.
00:08:16 You're all polarized, you're all politicized,
00:08:18 and you're all a fucking militant, tribalistic,
00:08:20 primitive cancer on this earth
00:08:21 that is holding us back as a species.
00:08:23 And every single one of you, all of you people,
00:08:25 all of you social justice warriors on the left,
00:08:27 all of you social justice warriors on the right,
00:08:29 you all need to be fucking terminated
00:08:31 and executed immediately.
00:08:32 Because you're destroying everything.
00:08:34 You're choking the empathy out of the human race,
00:08:37 and you all need to be fucking dealt with.
00:08:40 All right, Jess, no time out.
00:08:42 Jess, you just said if you're against social justice warriors,
00:08:44 then you are one, and then you say
00:08:46 they should all be exterminated.
00:08:48 So does that make you a social justice warrior?
00:08:50 It makes me the one true social justice warrior.
00:08:53 The only one in the world, everyone else is doing it wrong.
00:08:56 There's one social justice warrior in us, me,
00:08:57 because I'm the only one who really cares about justice
00:08:59 and social progress for both sides, for all people.
00:09:03 I'm the only one who's not sitting
00:09:04 in my own little fucking corner saying,
00:09:06 you know, rah-rah for the home team, fuck the other guys.
00:09:09 I'm the only intelligent person,
00:09:10 the only one standing against this wave of retardation
00:09:13 that is just drowning the entire world.
00:09:15 I'm the only smart one,
00:09:15 and more people need to listen to me,
00:09:17 and no one else, fuck all of you.
00:09:18 The end.
00:09:19 I think more positively about the kind of,
00:09:24 what's the word I'm looking for, benevolent despot,
00:09:26 you know, that seems more and more appealing to me.
00:09:28 But okay, got it.
00:09:30 Note real quick, I should factor into my ideology
00:09:32 that I also find the opposite, well, yeah, as Jesse said,
00:09:37 just the same people on the right side,
00:09:39 almost more infuriating to me specifically.
00:09:42 I mean, like, what is really the difference
00:09:45 between this group of people who, you know,
00:09:48 everyone who disagrees with me is a Nazi?
00:09:50 What's the difference between that
00:09:52 and everyone who disagrees with me is a cock?
00:09:54 They're exactly the fucking same mentality.
00:09:56 I see what you're saying.
00:09:57 I think that they sort of have come from the same place.
00:10:00 More, in recent history, it manifested more.
00:10:03 It's the same sense of sort of, you know,
00:10:06 fighting back against the ideology
00:10:08 that you feel is becoming too entrenched.
00:10:10 It's all, it's just, it's fighting fire with fire,
00:10:13 because like the social justice movement
00:10:14 hit the mainstream, it got a lot of attention,
00:10:16 and like, you know, you have like governments
00:10:18 and companies kind of capitulating to that ideology,
00:10:21 and you have people who are against it,
00:10:23 basically saying like, okay, if you wanna be tribalist,
00:10:25 we're gonna be a tribe and fight you with tribalism,
00:10:28 which is kind of like the natural reaction,
00:10:31 but not the one that's very well thought out.
00:10:33 So like, they're both, they're both operating
00:10:35 using the same tactics, but with different ideologies
00:10:37 and different value systems.
00:10:38 So they're both wrong in their execution,
00:10:40 despite having different kind of motivations for doing, so.
00:10:44 If you're talking about like, yeah,
00:10:45 these kind of political activists,
00:10:47 SJWs on both sides, then yeah, you're totally right.
00:10:49 So Hippo, what do you think, dude?
00:10:52 I think the clue is-
00:10:54 As the only non-American, I'm curious
00:10:56 what you have to say.
00:10:57 I mean, it's the same over here
00:10:58 because the internet's everywhere, but-
00:11:01 What?
00:11:02 The clue.
00:11:03 You guys have the internet?
00:11:04 Yeah, dude.
00:11:06 Whoa, okay.
00:11:07 Fuck that joke, it's stupid.
00:11:08 All right.
00:11:09 I think that the clue is in the name.
00:11:14 Social justice warriors, they fight in wars with weapons
00:11:18 and they're brutal and they're clan based
00:11:20 and they attack people.
00:11:21 And social justice, I think, is a neat idea
00:11:26 that warriors have taken and used
00:11:29 to bludgeon people to death with.
00:11:30 It's just sort of, if you're fighting for a cause,
00:11:34 it's an okay cause, it shouldn't be ignored.
00:11:37 It's not the biggest problem in the world, social justice,
00:11:40 but it shouldn't be ignored, it's real.
00:11:42 And it's good to have more representation and stuff
00:11:46 and their quality and all that, people being good.
00:11:50 And then we've got all these warriors and a war
00:11:52 and it's like everything that's called a war.
00:11:55 It's like everyone gets hurt and nobody's happy
00:11:57 and everything's shit.
00:11:58 So I think the warriors is the main part
00:12:01 that sucks about it all.
00:12:03 That's my stance.
00:12:06 Okay, I'll say mine before we get to Ben's
00:12:08 because I think his might be the most different.
00:12:12 I agree with most of you guys.
00:12:13 I don't care for a lot of the tech.
00:12:15 I mean, if we're talking about not people
00:12:17 promoting these kinds of ideas,
00:12:19 but specifically the SJW people.
00:12:22 Yeah, not a fan of what seems to be,
00:12:26 I see this happen on both sides a lot,
00:12:28 the kind of willing to ignore facts.
00:12:31 Like the goal is to promote the ideology
00:12:35 as opposed to intellectually honestly pursue
00:12:40 what appears to be correct and then operate based on that.
00:12:44 That's where I really, that's where I get my most annoyance.
00:12:48 When I see things like, just to bring up one big example.
00:12:50 Just monks, then it might be better.
00:12:53 That's true, that's true.
00:12:55 Like one thing that infuriates me that gets brought up
00:12:57 is the way that the gender pay gap
00:13:01 gets brought up repeatedly.
00:13:03 And it's not inaccurate to say that men overall
00:13:06 earn more than women overall,
00:13:08 but it's in the nuance of that point
00:13:11 where either deception or the actual truth lies
00:13:14 because the truth is that,
00:13:16 they say 77 cents on the dollar.
00:13:18 It is that men overall, in total,
00:13:22 all people, all men in America make like 100 cents
00:13:26 compared to the average woman's 77 cents,
00:13:28 but that's during net earnings for a year.
00:13:31 So it's just that women are in different jobs
00:13:33 and there may be a small pay gap,
00:13:37 but it is not the massive,
00:13:39 like almost 25% people talk about.
00:13:41 And it's when people bring up that idea,
00:13:44 like Obama himself did it.
00:13:45 And I'm sure people have heard this a thousand times,
00:13:47 but like Obama said sense,
00:13:49 we have to pay women the full amount that men get paid.
00:13:52 It's just not fair.
00:13:53 It's me, President Barack Obama, this is how I am.
00:13:57 It's in the way that he presented that point,
00:14:00 which made it look like your average business
00:14:02 gives a woman 77 cents and a man doing the same job,
00:14:06 one dollar, which is factually inaccurate.
00:14:09 And it is by saying things like that,
00:14:11 that people are deceived and you create this kind of outrage
00:14:14 about things that aren't real.
00:14:16 So like when you've got people who are outraged
00:14:17 by things that aren't true,
00:14:19 fighting people who are aware of the truth,
00:14:21 like I don't really blame the people getting mad.
00:14:23 They've just been filled false information
00:14:26 and they're confronted with conflicting information.
00:14:28 Of course there's gonna be a conflict.
00:14:29 Like what else could you expect in a situation like that?
00:14:31 So it comes like the responsibility is on everyone
00:14:34 to be truthful and honest and accurate.
00:14:37 But people aren't capable of pursuing
00:14:39 that responsibility or holding to it.
00:14:41 People are, they're not looking for nuance.
00:14:43 They're looking for an excuse
00:14:44 to justify their own bitterness
00:14:46 and everything that they do.
00:14:47 It's all that people care about because like,
00:14:50 you should be able to say,
00:14:52 any intelligent person should be able to say,
00:14:54 well, obviously the wage gap is not a real thing
00:14:57 because I work with women and they don't make,
00:15:00 you know, more or less than me, you know.
00:15:02 Everyone should be able to, but people can't,
00:15:06 people have this like conflation they do where like,
00:15:08 if one thing supports their side,
00:15:10 then everything must support their side,
00:15:12 even if it doesn't.
00:15:14 Well, the wage gap isn't true and that's bullshit.
00:15:16 So, you know, everyone who believes in that is dumb.
00:15:18 Yeah, okay.
00:15:19 It's not true and it's dumb.
00:15:21 And also this stuff about, you know,
00:15:23 how women might sometimes like get harassed in the workplace.
00:15:27 That's also not true because the wage gap, like, what?
00:15:29 No, you can have both.
00:15:31 You can have a brain and have empathy,
00:15:34 except you can't, only I can.
00:15:35 Going back to what you were talking about.
00:15:36 That's why everyone hates me.
00:15:37 The left hates me because I have a brain
00:15:39 and the right hates me because I have empathy.
00:15:42 Well, it just goes back to what you were saying earlier
00:15:44 about how both sides are dumb.
00:15:46 It's because there seems to be no room in people's heads
00:15:49 or this discussion in general, you're aside for nuance.
00:15:52 You know what the problem is?
00:15:53 The problem is, I think, I see this all the time.
00:15:55 And God, I see this with guys like Sargon.
00:15:58 They just like block out things that look like they're correct
00:16:01 and they're just not focused.
00:16:02 There's this problem of focus where people just do not
00:16:07 emphasize the things that are true,
00:16:09 but don't help their argument.
00:16:12 It's not like you're lying, but this is the whole problem,
00:16:14 that it's so hard to be intellectually honest
00:16:17 and accurate with your information.
00:16:18 And there's this additional problem
00:16:20 that I think people have such a hard time
00:16:22 relating to things that don't,
00:16:23 and I don't blame them at all.
00:16:24 I'm like this too, everyone's like this.
00:16:26 People have such a hard time processing macro issues
00:16:29 as opposed to specific issues in their life.
00:16:32 Like if you have a job and the women there
00:16:37 aren't sexually harassed, it is your experience in life
00:16:40 that women never get sexually harassed ever.
00:16:43 So you're like, why is this a problem?
00:16:44 It never happens.
00:16:45 Look at my life.
00:16:46 This has never happened to me.
00:16:47 Like I understand why that guy would think that way.
00:16:51 It's, that's right.
00:16:52 It's when you live in a bubble, when you live in a bubble
00:16:55 and you've never seen discrimination
00:16:59 or you've never seen what you considered re-discrimination
00:17:02 and you've never seen inequality,
00:17:05 it's easy to tell yourself that it doesn't exist.
00:17:08 That's why people talk about white privilege
00:17:12 and the thing about white privilege
00:17:13 is that white people can deny that it exists
00:17:16 because they don't have to deal
00:17:18 with the ramifications of not having it.
00:17:20 And what they say is that if you don't,
00:17:23 like only if you don't have white privilege
00:17:25 do you need to acknowledge it, you know?
00:17:27 Like if you've got white privilege,
00:17:30 the part of that privilege is the privilege
00:17:32 to pretend that there is no white privilege.
00:17:34 And to take it one step further,
00:17:36 I would say that like,
00:17:37 I'm talking kind of about that bubble as well,
00:17:39 but about like a bubble that is unavoidable for anyone.
00:17:42 And that is that like we observe the world
00:17:44 through our individual perception as one human being.
00:17:47 But like the most accurate way to like deal with this problem
00:17:51 is to look at things like mass gathered statistics.
00:17:54 It's like the only way to accurately assess like,
00:17:56 okay, how much of a problem is like workplace sexual harassment?
00:18:00 Like no one's individual account
00:18:02 is going to help us solve that problem particularly much.
00:18:05 You have to aggregate like all the information.
00:18:07 And it's so easy to just look at that and be like,
00:18:10 ah, fuck it, I don't care.
00:18:10 I don't care about that.
00:18:11 Even if you aggregate like the statistics,
00:18:13 you then have, well, okay, but what is the actual like cost
00:18:17 of that?
00:18:18 Like how like, like, like no two,
00:18:20 no two harassments are like the same.
00:18:23 You can't put like a dollar amount on them.
00:18:27 Yeah, yeah, that's another problem.
00:18:29 Experiences are the same, no two people.
00:18:31 That's why the whole privileged, you know,
00:18:33 genre of arguments in general is fucking goofy and retarded.
00:18:37 Well, I think like the whole thing is that you can have,
00:18:41 like I don't think there's like people who say
00:18:43 there's no such thing as like racism or discrimination
00:18:46 or like white privileges and the thing.
00:18:47 I think that's stupid.
00:18:49 Of course there is, you know,
00:18:50 there are people out there going to think that my problem
00:18:52 is when you have social justice worries saying
00:18:54 that all of this is systemic,
00:18:56 which I don't think there's really any basis
00:18:57 for saying there's systemic.
00:18:58 Can you define systemic for everybody?
00:18:59 Cause that seems to get fucked up a lot.
00:19:01 Well, I mean, as far as I can understand systemic,
00:19:04 when social justice refers to something as systemic racism
00:19:07 or systemic privilege and stuff like that,
00:19:09 it's talking about a concept that is pervasive
00:19:14 throughout all of society
00:19:16 or is like ingrained in law somehow.
00:19:18 Yeah, does it necessarily imply that it's baked
00:19:20 into law specifically or can like?
00:19:23 Sometimes it sounds like that's what they're,
00:19:25 I mean, again, like I'm not a social justice warrior.
00:19:27 I think the problem here is that it's a little bit too vague
00:19:29 and like we can, we can have different meanings.
00:19:32 The interesting thing with the social justice argument
00:19:35 is that it kind of like points at a boogeyman sometimes.
00:19:37 It's like, okay, cause like you have people saying like,
00:19:40 we need to end, we need to end white privilege.
00:19:43 It's like, okay.
00:19:44 Does anyone really think,
00:19:45 does anyone who knows what white privilege is
00:19:48 and understand what it actually means,
00:19:50 does anyone like that actually think we can just end it?
00:19:54 Well, that's the whole thing.
00:19:55 It's like, what do you, why,
00:19:57 that's what they want to do.
00:19:58 They want this equality of outcome.
00:20:01 And they want, we can't, we can't just end.
00:20:04 Okay, good.
00:20:05 Can't we just all get along?
00:20:09 No, well, can't we all just Pokemon go to the polls?
00:20:12 I mean, yes, queen.
00:20:14 That's the solution to all of our problems.
00:20:17 It's her time.
00:20:18 It's her time.
00:20:19 Hi, here's my second Hillary song.
00:20:21 What up, wow, Hillary.
00:20:23 You make my ass whole flame, Hillary.
00:20:27 I got AIDS, thank you, Hillary.
00:20:30 Wow.
00:20:32 Hillary Clinton, widespread AIDS support.
00:20:34 Hillary Clinton, everybody, she'll be here all week.
00:20:36 Yeah, all right, thank you, Hillary, thank you.
00:20:38 No, it's Hillary fan 306.
00:20:41 Oh my God.
00:20:44 I was gonna say Hillary fan 666, she's the devil.
00:20:48 She's my queen, I worship the devil.
00:20:50 But anyway, so we didn't get to Ben.
00:20:52 So Ben, why don't you tell us your stance on this?
00:20:54 I need to get in the bra, what's up?
00:20:56 Well, I really believe, I really believe in all the ideals
00:21:03 that I think the SJW movement is, like, wants.
00:21:07 Like, everything that they want, I think would be great.
00:21:11 You know, equality, representation, egalitarianism,
00:21:16 everyone gets a fair shake.
00:21:18 But like, okay, I don't believe that equality of outcome,
00:21:23 like, to bring about equality of outcome,
00:21:28 you would just have to take away everyone's freedom.
00:21:30 Like, you would just have to dictate
00:21:32 exactly what everyone gets and make sure
00:21:34 everyone gets the same thing.
00:21:34 State-enforced communism is what that amounts
00:21:36 to all times.
00:21:37 Yeah, that's what it would be.
00:21:38 State-enforced homosexuality.
00:21:39 It's coming, dude, it's coming.
00:21:40 So like, I'm all about equality and SJW bullshit
00:21:47 and all that crap that sucks, but I stop short
00:21:51 of being willing to like call for like...
00:21:54 Equality for everyone but Pokemon.
00:21:55 They're not people, they're not people.
00:22:00 Yeah, but like, yeah, I also don't believe
00:22:02 in telling people what to do.
00:22:03 Like, I kind of think that like, if an employer is racist
00:22:07 and hates Mexicans, like, if he starts his business
00:22:09 and is like, well, I'm not gonna hire any Mexicans,
00:22:11 I mean, that sucks, but I kind of think
00:22:13 that's his prerogative in a way.
00:22:15 Yeah, you would think like, really,
00:22:17 ideally the free market would just be like,
00:22:18 well, fuck that guy, we're not gonna, you know,
00:22:20 if you can deal with that.
00:22:21 Like, one of the things that, one of the stories
00:22:23 in a couple, in recent years that really got to me
00:22:26 was for this issue, like, there was a baker
00:22:31 who was asked to make a cake for a gay wedding
00:22:33 and they're religious, I hate all religious people,
00:22:36 by the way, but they didn't want to
00:22:37 because of their religion and, you know,
00:22:39 because they're Christ fags or whatever.
00:22:41 And so they didn't want to.
00:22:42 And then later on, like, they were sort of,
00:22:45 they were forced to do it, like, they were sued
00:22:48 or whatever and they were forced to do it.
00:22:49 Well, that's some bullshit.
00:22:50 That's where I hit a fucking, that's where I get mad
00:22:54 because to say that you're not allowed to, like,
00:22:57 hurt people, totally on board, makes sense to me,
00:22:59 but to force people to do things
00:23:03 that they don't want to do, that's, like,
00:23:06 that's a whole nother ballgame, to impel action
00:23:09 at, like, otherwise you'll go to jail or whatever.
00:23:11 Yeah, like, saying, like, if these people were straight,
00:23:15 you would have done this, therefore, you have to do it.
00:23:18 Yeah, right, that's not.
00:23:20 I think a lot of the social justice,
00:23:23 there's like this, they don't understand that
00:23:26 even if, like, people hate people, like groups of people,
00:23:29 they all, even if race wasn't a thing,
00:23:32 we would hate each other based on what town we came from
00:23:34 or, you know, what street you came from,
00:23:36 like, various things we would divide ourselves up into
00:23:40 and say, well, I don't like those people,
00:23:41 they're from the next town over.
00:23:42 If it wasn't race, it would be something else.
00:23:44 So you can't ever end, like, subjugation of a group.
00:23:47 Yeah, it's never, it's impossible to do.
00:23:48 That's an interesting point,
00:23:49 because I think that a large,
00:23:51 I think a lot of it comes from, like,
00:23:52 a base-level ideological difference between,
00:23:55 between, like, more, I guess, conservative is the word to use,
00:23:57 conservative versus, like, SJW people,
00:23:59 which is that SJW people, in general, or, like, the left,
00:24:03 seems to have their mind, have in their mind,
00:24:06 and I kind of agree with this,
00:24:07 that people will be able, like, humans as a species,
00:24:10 will be able to overcome, like,
00:24:12 our generic kind of prejudices,
00:24:14 and we will be able to solve these kind of issues
00:24:17 as time goes on.
00:24:17 And so they're kind of working towards that,
00:24:19 whereas conservative people more accept
00:24:21 that that's a reality, that they can't change,
00:24:23 and are sort of comfortable trying to just deal with that
00:24:26 as far away as possible.
00:24:27 I would like it if people didn't care so much about race,
00:24:30 but I understand that there's always gonna be groups
00:24:33 dividing people up, you know,
00:24:35 even if we finally end, like, racism of skin color,
00:24:39 it's gonna be something else.
00:24:41 And I don't, I don't think, you know,
00:24:43 we're all ever gonna be on the same page ever
00:24:45 as a species.
00:24:46 I don't quite agree, but that's interesting,
00:24:48 that's interesting.
00:24:49 Well, I mean, you know, there's always,
00:24:51 I'm thinking about Starfleet Dog,
00:24:53 I'm thinking about Starfleet.
00:24:53 There's too many people to get, like, on the same page.
00:24:57 I disagree.
00:24:58 Well, you know what, you know what's a great example of this?
00:25:00 I think the ending of Watchmen is a really cool
00:25:03 example of this sort of issue,
00:25:05 because at the end of Watchmen,
00:25:06 like, the world is about to be destroyed by these,
00:25:08 these kind of like, you know,
00:25:11 country-based divisions between, you know,
00:25:12 like, it's the Cold War,
00:25:13 it's a Russian America in the 80s,
00:25:15 and like they are on,
00:25:17 they are one minute from midnight,
00:25:18 which means like a nuclear war is like about to happen.
00:25:21 And so, Vite, or Ozymandias,
00:25:25 like the quote-unquote villain,
00:25:27 like he staged this whole operation
00:25:29 to basically trick humanity into not destroying itself
00:25:32 by uniting it against an interdimensional alien race
00:25:35 that they, that he like,
00:25:37 sets the situation up as invading Earth.
00:25:39 We don't have any of those.
00:25:39 And almost immediately, well, that he made one up,
00:25:42 he invented a false one,
00:25:43 and that at least temporarily solved the problem
00:25:46 of like humanity about to destroy itself.
00:25:48 And I sort of think that for just for one crazy example,
00:25:51 if we had something like, you know,
00:25:53 space travel and relationships with other alien life forms,
00:25:56 all of humanity would look at each other
00:25:58 and be like, you know what?
00:25:59 I guess we are pretty similar compared to these guys.
00:26:01 They're a bunch of weirdos that we don't understand,
00:26:03 but we, you know what I'm saying?
00:26:04 I think that perspective-
00:26:05 I think that perspective, like if we had that,
00:26:09 would definitely help.
00:26:10 But I mean, the whole thing is that like,
00:26:12 for example, like we still hate people.
00:26:14 Like, even-
00:26:15 Of course.
00:26:16 I hate Ben Stain, for example.
00:26:17 You just said you hate all religious people.
00:26:18 Well, Nate, you just said you hate all religious people,
00:26:21 you know?
00:26:22 I do.
00:26:23 I do, I want to say that.
00:26:23 Like you thought it was a joke,
00:26:24 like you still, there's still some disdain
00:26:25 for religious people.
00:26:26 They're holding us back,
00:26:27 and I, oh my God, you totally got me.
00:26:28 You're absolutely right.
00:26:29 So, I'm a total hypocrite.
00:26:30 It's just like, we're always gonna have like prejudices.
00:26:33 And like, the thing is that like these prejudices,
00:26:36 they don't always come into play, you know?
00:26:38 Like, it's, I think it's less about our thoughts-
00:26:40 I like to think that this is a very
00:26:42 parental brain.
00:26:43 Oh, sorry, sorry.
00:26:44 Go ahead.
00:26:45 You can dislike somebody,
00:26:46 but as long as you don't let that,
00:26:47 like affect your day-to-day interactions,
00:26:49 that's what true tolerance is.
00:26:50 It's not about like loving everything.
00:26:52 It's just about like, you know,
00:26:53 letting bygones be bygones.
00:26:54 Like, you know?
00:26:55 Yeah, the best case scenario for the future
00:26:58 is that when somebody is like racist or whatever,
00:27:01 or dislikes a whole group of people,
00:27:03 they would just, they would channel it into apathy.
00:27:06 They would just be like,
00:27:07 oh, fuck that guy, I don't care, whatever.
00:27:08 It does, because it tends to not affect you directly.
00:27:11 Most of the time.
00:27:13 You know what this reminds me of?
00:27:14 This reminds me of my award-winning video on T-Bap.
00:27:18 Keg reviews, putting your hoof down.
00:27:20 The world-famous My Little Pony episode.
00:27:22 Speaking of people I hate, fuck Bronies.
00:27:25 They're the worst.
00:27:26 It's just, Fluttershy is this cute little pony,
00:27:29 but in that episode, we learn that deep down,
00:27:31 she has a burning hatred for everyone in her life.
00:27:34 But what makes her the fitting element of kindness
00:27:36 is that she is able to suppress that rage.
00:27:39 Is that she looks past her friends,
00:27:40 horrible inadequacies.
00:27:41 Yes, that's right.
00:27:41 And she pretends to like them anyway.
00:27:44 And that's why she's the best guy ever.
00:27:48 She is the best.
00:27:49 She is the best.
00:27:50 Yeah.
00:27:51 Oh, I like that one.
00:27:52 I'm gonna put that in my book.
00:27:54 It's funny that you bring up My Little Pony,
00:27:57 because, and this sounds like a non sequadar,
00:28:00 but I'm gonna make it make sense.
00:28:03 Recently, they released on YouTube the teaser
00:28:05 for the My Little Pony movie.
00:28:09 Is this the real one with the actual ponies now?
00:28:12 Oh, that's exciting.
00:28:13 What are you talking about?
00:28:13 Well, you know, as opposed to like the humans,
00:28:15 as opposed to equestria girls.
00:28:16 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:28:17 It's the real.
00:28:18 That's not the movie.
00:28:19 But the teaser on YouTube has like mostly thumbs down.
00:28:24 And at first I'm like,
00:28:25 why the fuck does this teaser have so many thumbs down?
00:28:27 And then I realized, oh,
00:28:28 it's because people still hate bronies.
00:28:29 And like, this is like putting bronies
00:28:31 in the forefront again, I guess.
00:28:32 And it's like, yeah, and it's like,
00:28:34 how can people still be invested in like not,
00:28:38 like how can people still give a shit
00:28:39 about bronies like existing?
00:28:41 And it's the same thing with social justice.
00:28:44 Like when I hear people complaining
00:28:45 about social justice warriors now,
00:28:47 I just roll my eyes like,
00:28:48 how the fuck can you still care?
00:28:49 That you've been, you people have been circle jerking
00:28:51 about this supposed problem with social justice warriors
00:28:54 that's gonna destroy society for fucking like,
00:28:57 like almost 10 years now.
00:28:58 And you just, it's never gonna stop.
00:29:00 It's just gonna go in circles forever and ever.
00:29:02 And both sides are gonna continue destroying society
00:29:04 in tandem because they're never gonna stop
00:29:06 fucking throwing shit at each other.
00:29:07 And everyone in the middle is going to get rained on
00:29:10 by all this fucking poo punch from the sky forever.
00:29:13 How can you still fucking care?
00:29:15 That's the problem.
00:29:15 It's people caring too much about stupid bullshit
00:29:18 that doesn't matter.
00:29:19 People care too much about the president.
00:29:21 They care too much about, you know,
00:29:22 whatever goofy social issue scandal of the day is going on.
00:29:24 People posting on Facebook,
00:29:25 arguing with their friends and family members
00:29:27 about everything.
00:29:28 Everyone's a fucking social justice warrior now
00:29:29 about something.
00:29:30 Everyone's got a fucking hill to die on about something
00:29:32 and fucking argue with everyone about something.
00:29:34 And it's just like, you know what the problem is?
00:29:36 It's that people are fucking empty and bitter
00:29:38 and sad and pathetic.
00:29:39 They hate their lives.
00:29:40 They hate themselves and they can't admit it.
00:29:42 And they've never fucking loved anyone.
00:29:44 That's what the problem is.
00:29:45 I think if you've ever just cared about another human being,
00:29:49 then you would have some kind of fucking empathy
00:29:51 or compassion inside you.
00:29:53 And you would realize that all of this fucking
00:29:55 tribalistic shit is fucking goofy, man.
00:29:58 It's that the problem, people are stupid.
00:30:00 They have no lives.
00:30:00 They don't love each other.
00:30:02 No one has ever fucking loved anyone.
00:30:03 No one loves themselves anymore.
00:30:06 They're all cancer.
00:30:07 Everything is cancer.
00:30:08 Everything is bad and nothing is good.
00:30:10 The world is irreparably broken.
00:30:11 And I'm the only one who fucking sees it.
00:30:13 No one else can see it.
00:30:15 You know what you remind me of, Jesse?
00:30:17 You know that comic of XKCD about all the people on the bus
00:30:20 having the same thought about how they're the only
00:30:22 smart one in the world.
00:30:23 Yes, and I'm all the people on the bus
00:30:25 and nobody else is on my bus.
00:30:26 Exactly.
00:30:27 That's right.
00:30:28 Hey, Jesse, you know who you were on me of?
00:30:30 Have you ever seen a little show called
00:30:32 Bojack Horseman, bro?
00:30:34 LOL.
00:30:38 You're like that one.
00:30:39 You know, I think, I understand why it's gone like this.
00:30:43 It's because the internet is based mostly in text.
00:30:48 And through text, you can't ascertain someone's
00:30:52 like real mood or the way they're saying something.
00:30:55 And we've seen it in our chat.
00:30:58 Like sometimes we'll be arguing and we won't actually
00:31:01 be as mad as we seem like we are.
00:31:03 And then on the internet, people,
00:31:04 they see these things on Twitter,
00:31:05 they argue over forums and Facebook and stuff.
00:31:08 And they come away thinking that these other people
00:31:11 are way angrier than they actually are.
00:31:13 And that's sort of like, it's gone in circles
00:31:16 and cycles and cycles and circles.
00:31:17 And to the point where people themselves
00:31:20 are in general being angrier.
00:31:22 There's a great communication is on the internet.
00:31:25 It's just people accusing each other of being mad
00:31:27 over and over again in a circle.
00:31:29 There's this great little flash game on Newgrounds
00:31:31 called You Become What You Behold.
00:31:33 Oh yeah.
00:31:34 And it's like a bunch of little stick figures
00:31:36 running around a room and you have like a camera.
00:31:39 And you can take pictures of things
00:31:41 and they show up on the TV screen in the middle of a room
00:31:44 and all the stick figures look at it and they react to it.
00:31:47 And basically what the point of the game is that
00:31:49 like they only care, like the stick figures only care
00:31:53 if you photograph something like bad happening.
00:31:55 So you'll photograph people that like bump into each other
00:31:58 and fight each other like a square and a circle
00:32:00 because they have different shaped heads.
00:32:01 Like a square and a circle will get mad at each other.
00:32:04 You photograph that and you put it on the screen
00:32:06 and then more like squares and circles
00:32:08 get mad at each other.
00:32:09 And you just like take more and more pictures
00:32:11 of like the people being mad at each other
00:32:13 because it keeps happening until everyone's mad
00:32:15 at each other and then it erupts.
00:32:17 And it creates this like sort of racist thing going on
00:32:20 between the squares and circles.
00:32:22 Yeah, everything was fine before.
00:32:24 Everything was fine before but because the racial tension
00:32:27 was so like brought to the forefront of media,
00:32:30 everyone like perceived it to be a bigger deal
00:32:32 than it was and then it got worse as a result.
00:32:34 Yeah, and the thing I really like about that
00:32:36 is that once it starts getting bad
00:32:37 and you try taking pictures of nice things happening,
00:32:39 it doesn't help, it just always continues to be worse.
00:32:42 Yeah, that's so, that's, that is an absolutely brilliant
00:32:45 representation.
00:32:45 It's true, I retweet wholesome memes every day
00:32:47 and the world still isn't fixed.
00:32:50 You're doing your part too.
00:32:51 You're doing, so, Jess, I don't want to misinterpret
00:32:54 your argument before I go against it.
00:32:56 So are you saying we shouldn't be talking about SJWs
00:33:00 in the first place because they aren't causing
00:33:02 any real harm?
00:33:04 No, I think that they are causing harm,
00:33:06 but I think that, you know, if you give a shit, fuck you.
00:33:10 So what harm, what harm would you say that they're causing?
00:33:14 I don't understand a question.
00:33:16 I don't understand a question.
00:33:16 You literally just said they're causing harm,
00:33:18 so what harm are they causing?
00:33:21 What do you mean?
00:33:22 What are you talking about?
00:33:23 Maybe you can give an example.
00:33:25 Okay, sure.
00:33:26 Job lynch mobs, that's an entirely SJW run thing.
00:33:29 People losing their jobs for having the wrong opinion
00:33:31 for saying the wrong word.
00:33:33 These SJWs are dangerous because they'll go after
00:33:35 these people online, they'll contact their employer,
00:33:37 they'll contact their family, their friends,
00:33:39 do whatever they can to ruin their lives.
00:33:41 Just because they have the wrong opinion politically,
00:33:43 or they say a word out of context or something.
00:33:46 So that's an example of how SJWs cause harm.
00:33:49 You're ascribing a philosophy to behavior,
00:33:53 but the behavior is done by people with all manner
00:33:57 of political and social stances.
00:34:00 I mean, it's not just social justice warriors
00:34:02 harassing people or setting out to fuck with people
00:34:06 or ruin each other's lives.
00:34:08 Everyone does that.
00:34:10 I mean, are you gonna tell me that?
00:34:11 Are you gonna tell me that polox don't go around?
00:34:13 Not polox the country, I mean like 4chan kids.
00:34:16 Are you gonna tell me that people on the right
00:34:18 don't do the same thing?
00:34:19 Yes, you've already defined for all of us
00:34:20 that social justice warriors are both into the spectrum.
00:34:22 So let's say I automatically agree with you.
00:34:24 If I'm saying social justice warriors
00:34:26 means angry idiots who care too much about stupid shit
00:34:30 and fight each other, then they, yeah, they just.
00:34:33 Oh yeah, well then that's definitely the,
00:34:35 yeah, that's the problem,
00:34:36 but the way to fight that problem
00:34:37 is not by caring more in response.
00:34:41 I think the way to solve it,
00:34:43 not that I would know,
00:34:45 but I think is just to be a nicer person in real life
00:34:48 and leave the internet alone a bit more.
00:34:50 Yeah, I think the problem in general
00:34:51 is just to leave the internet.
00:34:53 Everyone, okay, the thing is we can't leave the internet
00:34:56 because that is real life now.
00:34:57 The internet is like the essential highway
00:34:59 through which everything important is done now.
00:35:01 You can't just, you know, ignore it.
00:35:04 You can't ignore it, but you can't listen it,
00:35:06 you can't like forget about Facebook.
00:35:08 Even if you, okay, I mean like if everyone did this,
00:35:11 then okay, that would make a difference,
00:35:12 but not everyone is going to be able to do this.
00:35:14 And currently, if I write a story saying, you know,
00:35:17 PewDiePie is a Nazi,
00:35:18 here are a bunch of screenshots that prove that,
00:35:20 no one knows.
00:35:21 I mean, immediately, they will first of all,
00:35:23 just see the headline and that will already,
00:35:26 like a billion people see it if I'm someone important,
00:35:28 like the fucking Wall Street Journal or whatever,
00:35:31 that will already make people flip out.
00:35:33 And it's just the reaction to that
00:35:36 without looking into the details,
00:35:37 which were 100% false in this case about PewDiePie.
00:35:41 It was just a bunch of stuff that were,
00:35:42 I mean, you could call it bad jokes,
00:35:44 but at no point was he ever advocating
00:35:46 for any of this stuff.
00:35:47 It was all just, in fact,
00:35:48 much of the time he was making fun of Nazis.
00:35:50 That is true, I mean.
00:35:51 Nonetheless, it's the response that is inevitable
00:35:55 in the day and times that we live in right now,
00:35:58 that people will flip out and corporations are forced,
00:36:01 as money-making machines, to react to it,
00:36:03 no matter what the actual truth is,
00:36:04 just if people are mad, they have to act
00:36:07 if they want to keep their problems up.
00:36:08 Well, on the PewDiePie thing, I mean,
00:36:10 I think we all agree that it's trumped up charges
00:36:13 and it's fucking ridiculous and false claims
00:36:14 and it's retarded. Of course, it's been proven many times.
00:36:16 You know, it's just people lying for clicks
00:36:18 and they should all be hung.
00:36:20 But it's not as though the people on that side
00:36:25 or whatever don't have a point at all,
00:36:26 because the idea that a guy with PewDiePie,
00:36:32 with all this reach and this young audience,
00:36:34 this impressionable audience,
00:36:36 the idea that joking about Nazis and stuff
00:36:40 and joking about rightist ideas, right ideas,
00:36:44 is seeping into young, impressionable minds
00:36:47 and making them who might not be as in tune
00:36:50 with satire or the memory behind it all,
00:36:53 that they might grow to honestly believe it.
00:36:55 I mean, that's obviously true.
00:36:57 That does happen.
00:36:59 I mean, that's what memes are.
00:37:01 Memes are just thought control.
00:37:02 It's just the way that people spread their message
00:37:04 in a humorous way.
00:37:05 It is impressioning minds to feel a certain way.
00:37:08 I mean, I don't think that that's
00:37:10 the entertainer's responsibility at all
00:37:11 to give a shit about that,
00:37:13 but I mean, it is a valid point in some small way.
00:37:17 You know, I kind of do think it is,
00:37:19 I sort of agree actually on the,
00:37:21 I do think that you have a responsibility as PewDiePie,
00:37:24 like legally you're not going to be held
00:37:26 to any kind of standard, like, oh, you have to,
00:37:28 you know, make people smart or whatever,
00:37:30 but there's definitely a responsibility
00:37:33 if you're reaching millions of people every single day
00:37:35 with the things you say to not be a monster,
00:37:38 which he's not, but like the worst thing he did,
00:37:41 the objectively worst thing he did was make a joke
00:37:44 about like, wow, will these guys on Fiverr
00:37:46 actually write a sign that says death to all Jews
00:37:49 or like kill all Jews or whatever it was,
00:37:50 even though it was that followed by subscribe to Keemstar.
00:37:53 I mean, I definitely think that like PewDiePie
00:37:56 was like the wrong target to make that point with
00:37:59 because all he does is make silly jokes.
00:38:01 But any story about PewDiePie gets views,
00:38:03 so that's the perfect one to do it about.
00:38:04 I mean, like, if they were saying that like,
00:38:05 that like, Sargon of Akkad is the problem,
00:38:08 then maybe they'd have more of a case.
00:38:10 I, I, okay.
00:38:13 I don't really watch him,
00:38:14 but I assume it's, he's basically the amazing atheist,
00:38:17 but different slightly.
00:38:20 What does he talk about?
00:38:21 Sargon has transformed.
00:38:22 I admit, I watch Sargon and he has,
00:38:25 he has transformed over views.
00:38:27 He just talks about social justice issues,
00:38:29 just like, you know, free speech and shit like that, you know?
00:38:32 Yeah, that's true.
00:38:32 He was speaking to Brexit because he's in England.
00:38:35 Yeah.
00:38:36 That was the thing that we talked about.
00:38:36 I think, well, we tend to bash Sargon.
00:38:39 He's very, he's very evidence-based.
00:38:40 I mean, he definitely has his agenda
00:38:42 in that he has his opinions and, you know,
00:38:44 presents them where appropriate.
00:38:45 We tend to bash Sargon a lot on this show,
00:38:47 but it's mostly because I can't think of any other names
00:38:50 that are in that genre.
00:38:51 Yeah, like, I have famously feuded on Twitter
00:38:55 with Sargon of a kind.
00:38:56 Yes.
00:38:57 Earning Ben swaths of Patreon bucks, right?
00:39:00 It's not that I think that Sargon is the worst of his kind.
00:39:03 It's that, it's that I hate his whole kind
00:39:05 and he's just the one that comes to mind the easiest.
00:39:08 He's just the first, he's just the first name I think of
00:39:10 when I think of like right-leaning internet pundits.
00:39:14 I, yeah, I hear what you're saying.
00:39:15 I do think, just, I don't know,
00:39:17 this is even appropriate to say now.
00:39:18 It's just that I do think that he's gotten more concerned
00:39:21 about providing factual like reasoning
00:39:24 behind what he's saying and he does a lot of reading
00:39:26 and presents like, oh, well, I read this book, you know,
00:39:28 fucking The Republic by Plato or whatever
00:39:30 and it has this idea.
00:39:31 I'm applying that to this thing I see happening.
00:39:33 So I don't know why I'm defending the guy.
00:39:35 Yeah, I mean, and obviously if there was like a,
00:39:38 like a left-leaning pundit that I could equally think of
00:39:41 to name and shit on him that I would, you know.
00:39:43 Anita.
00:39:44 Anita's the one.
00:39:44 I hate that, I hate the fact that
00:39:46 in order to shit on someone,
00:39:47 you have to find someone on the opposite end of the spectrum
00:39:50 to also shit on or else everyone's going to accuse you
00:39:52 of being on that side.
00:39:53 That's, yeah, that's true.
00:39:55 That's where we're at.
00:39:56 Well, it's the cultural binary.
00:39:57 It's always been there, that's bullshit.
00:39:59 You're right on.
00:40:00 There's a guy I found recently called Quinton Reviews
00:40:02 who he made, he's made a couple of drama videos about,
00:40:06 but he, and a few reviews and stuff.
00:40:08 And he seems like really nuanced.
00:40:10 Like he's like exactly in the middle
00:40:12 in terms of being a totally reasonable human being.
00:40:15 And I kind of really love that because he's like,
00:40:17 he's actually kind of, he's got a hundred thousand subs
00:40:19 and he's like doing decently well
00:40:21 and he's not crazy on one side or the other.
00:40:24 Like he did a review of Ghostbusters
00:40:26 and he actually talked about, you know,
00:40:28 the new one.
00:40:29 Mofeminism, Mofeminism!
00:40:30 But he actually like went into it like,
00:40:33 like as a normal person, like a real human being.
00:40:36 And he said, well, you know, it's just an okay movie
00:40:39 and all this and that.
00:40:40 And then he explained what it was, you know,
00:40:42 cause like every other video about Ghostbusters
00:40:45 that I had seen was like, oh my God,
00:40:47 I can't believe everyone likes it
00:40:49 or I can't believe anyone hates it.
00:40:51 It's like, whatever.
00:40:54 I mean, I'm not trying-
00:40:55 And his video is really nice.
00:40:56 I mean, I'm not trying to say that like it's impossible
00:40:59 to examine these issues from an unbiased
00:41:01 or at least from a nuanced perspective
00:41:04 or that like, you know, opinions are just bad
00:41:06 and nobody should say anything about any social issue.
00:41:09 I just, I'm just so like wary of people who care too much.
00:41:13 I don't trust them.
00:41:14 When I feel like someone gives too much of a shit
00:41:17 about these issues, they just come off like they're just like,
00:41:21 they must be like an empty, bitter weirdo to me.
00:41:23 I mean, I think-
00:41:24 I guess there's just people who are into politics
00:41:25 and social issues.
00:41:26 I think that's what makes an SJW
00:41:29 is someone that cares too much about it.
00:41:31 Yeah.
00:41:32 To an unhealthy level.
00:41:33 And I think we should bring back you, Mad Bro.
00:41:36 That should really like grow.
00:41:38 I don't know about that.
00:41:39 That's the equivalent of get good.
00:41:41 It's a discussion ending.
00:41:43 It's like they are mad and they'll be like,
00:41:44 I'm not mad and then they'll feel stupid for being mad
00:41:47 and then they'll try and be normal.
00:41:49 I suppose that's true.
00:41:50 Yeah, you can tell a gamer goes into an old spaghetti factory
00:41:53 and breaks all the dishes.
00:41:55 What are you gonna do about liberals?
00:41:59 He, that munchie really leveled up.
00:42:02 No!
00:42:03 No!
00:42:04 Oh God.
00:42:06 Guys, Gamergate.
00:42:10 Gamergate was cool, right?
00:42:11 Remember that?
00:42:12 Guys, look at how fucking Gamergate.
00:42:15 Well, I don't know what there is to say.
00:42:17 Gamergate was a bunch-
00:42:18 No, no, it was a joke, Nate.
00:42:20 It was a joke.
00:42:20 No, actually, don't actually start talking about it.
00:42:22 Okay, abort, abort.
00:42:23 Okay, DeVoo, you know, here's something
00:42:25 that's interesting.
00:42:26 DeVoo, I see this-
00:42:27 Wait, have we done a PCP on Gamergate yet?
00:42:28 We told you!
00:42:29 We have!
00:42:31 No!
00:42:32 At least we are firmly post Gamergate
00:42:34 so we can kind of assess it.
00:42:36 Gamergate PCP, it'll be a bonus episode.
00:42:38 I'm gonna kick that bonus episode.
00:42:40 Gamergate, what's the problem?
00:42:41 The next bonus episode, Gamergate,
00:42:43 starring only Munchie.
00:42:44 You know what, that could be plain everyone else.
00:42:46 We should do it as a bonus episode.
00:42:47 That would be pretty funny.
00:42:48 It would be a fucking bad idea.
00:42:50 The only reason I don't want to do it
00:42:51 is because I had never looked into any of it
00:42:54 and I don't care so much.
00:42:56 I, that's the exact right perspective.
00:42:57 It was, I feel like, not until months after it ended.
00:43:00 Did I even begin to understand what Gamergate referred to?
00:43:03 I was very invested in it for like the first three days of it
00:43:07 and then it went on for like seven more months
00:43:09 and I'm like, what is wrong with you people?
00:43:11 What's going on?
00:43:12 Why do you care?
00:43:14 Hey, you know, I wanna talk about...
00:43:15 It's because that slut Zoey Quinn
00:43:18 slept her way to the top of the video game
00:43:20 and I am insane!
00:43:22 I'm a Gamer!
00:43:23 I pricked my bones!
00:43:26 I, man, I know a lot of shit about her that I read.
00:43:28 But anyway, so Davoo mentioned something else.
00:43:32 In the chat, he just said like,
00:43:33 the Young Turks was all the time posted.
00:43:35 Yeah, that's an example of like a left-leaning pundit
00:43:37 on YouTube.
00:43:37 The interesting thing about the Young Turks is that,
00:43:40 I'm coming out.
00:43:41 I'm going like the Young Turks.
00:43:42 I'm coming out of the closet.
00:43:44 I watch the Young Turks all the fucking time.
00:43:47 All the time, I watch the Young Turks.
00:43:49 Among the most politically invested among us.
00:43:53 I mean, I think Monkey might also be, but...
00:43:55 That's possibly true.
00:43:56 Here's the thing about the Young Turks though.
00:43:58 Cenk Yuger, the main guy.
00:44:00 I fucking love Cenk Yuger as a person.
00:44:03 He is like the most fun and the most goofy and silly
00:44:07 and I love everything he says until he starts talking
00:44:10 about his SJW shit when I want to kill myself.
00:44:13 Like the left-leaning Alex Jones a little bit.
00:44:17 Oh, he would get so mad.
00:44:19 I was thinking that same thing the other day.
00:44:20 He would flip his shit because he hates Alex Jones.
00:44:23 Did you ever see that video where they fought?
00:44:24 It was great.
00:44:25 Of course, of course.
00:44:26 It was nuts.
00:44:27 Have you ever watched Karen Strone or whatever?
00:44:30 Strone?
00:44:31 Strone?
00:44:32 The fucking Gourds, what?
00:44:32 The short haired lady.
00:44:33 She's like an anti-feminist talker
00:44:36 and she's very articulate and, you know,
00:44:38 among the least retarded ones, I think.
00:44:41 But she was on there, like that guy was just yelling at it
00:44:45 like, shut up!
00:44:46 Yes, you are oppressed, you fucking idiot!
00:44:48 You stupid idiot!
00:44:49 You so oppressed!
00:44:50 Shut up!
00:44:51 That blows my mind.
00:44:53 It's so weird to see a fucking straight,
00:44:56 almost white male telling a woman how oppressed she is
00:44:59 when she's arguing against that.
00:45:01 It's just, I mean, I get what's going on here.
00:45:03 He might as well be hitting on himself.
00:45:05 And I gotta say, one of the things,
00:45:07 the biggest problem for me with Cenk in general
00:45:09 is that he has this fucking retarded feud
00:45:14 with one of my favorite people on the internet right now,
00:45:16 Sam Harris.
00:45:17 He has been fucking, just the other day,
00:45:19 I'm watching the show,
00:45:20 I'm watching the stream on like Friday or something.
00:45:22 He just, he brings in a little joke
00:45:25 just to shit on like Sam Harris out of nowhere
00:45:28 because he just fucking hates the guy
00:45:30 after he's the one who took all his arguments out of context
00:45:32 and just doesn't understand what it is he's being.
00:45:35 It's so fucking weird that he still is doubling down
00:45:37 on that after Sam Harris fucking destroyed him
00:45:39 for like an hour.
00:45:40 I get it, he doesn't like it.
00:45:42 Like now they're just fighting,
00:45:43 now they just hate each other.
00:45:44 But he got to that place,
00:45:45 there's such a fucking retarded clusterfuck
00:45:47 of his own circular, I'm sorry, I'm going on a rant.
00:45:50 It sounds like you care a lot about it.
00:45:53 I'm invested in that.
00:45:54 And that means you're social justice,
00:45:55 you're social justice warrior.
00:45:57 I can't watch these fucks.
00:45:59 And that means you need to Pokemon go to the polls
00:46:02 to cleanse yourself.
00:46:03 I need to vote for Hillary like 20 times
00:46:05 to cleanse myself of this.
00:46:07 That's my ablution.
00:46:09 Memes are cool, I like the jokes,
00:46:12 but I don't like the political ones.
00:46:14 Hey, you know who doesn't like jokes?
00:46:15 SJWs, those are offensive.
00:46:19 Hey, let's talk about cultural appropriations.
00:46:20 Let me talk about what I want to talk about.
00:46:25 I go on YouTube and I go to my subscriptions
00:46:27 and I have like, oh, there's another tab, trending.
00:46:29 Let me reconnect with my fellow humans.
00:46:31 What do they think is popular right now?
00:46:33 It's all like anti-Donald Trump shit
00:46:35 and I always watch it.
00:46:36 Oh God, I hate the trending hashtags so fucking much.
00:46:39 It's the worst, it's the worst.
00:46:41 You guys don't like that shit?
00:46:43 I almost always agree.
00:46:44 And yeah, I basically always agree.
00:46:46 I watched Donald Trump's stuff
00:46:47 and I wanna know why is there not stuff
00:46:50 like this for the right,
00:46:51 because I want to watch every political opinion
00:46:53 and then forward afterwards.
00:46:55 I think we know why.
00:46:56 They don't want you to see that shit.
00:46:57 They are controlling it.
00:46:58 There's no, all they have to do is add one tag
00:47:01 about whatever to flag things as offensive
00:47:03 and it won't, you know,
00:47:04 because they control the system.
00:47:04 They control it, right.
00:47:05 You know, there's no doubt in my mind.
00:47:07 I have been enjoying like Razorfists' rants
00:47:09 about Donald Trump, people who hate him.
00:47:13 Cause Razor, you know, what is the rageaholic guy?
00:47:16 Yeah, Razorfists is great.
00:47:17 Yeah, right, right.
00:47:18 I like the fact that he's quick with his videos.
00:47:21 So I don't have to sit
00:47:22 through a 40 minute lecture or a podcast.
00:47:25 That's kind of the problem with a lot of the alternative media,
00:47:28 quote unquote, is they tend to be very long-winded
00:47:30 because they're exhaustive in their points and stuff.
00:47:33 Yeah, Saigon of a card.
00:47:35 I think I've watched one video of Saigon's
00:47:37 and it was just him sentence by sentence
00:47:41 reacting to someone's video
00:47:42 and it was like a 40 minute video.
00:47:43 And I can't imagine unless I was already invested
00:47:46 in his content that anyone would like
00:47:48 I think that's kind of the problem
00:47:50 with the alternative media and what's kind of happening.
00:47:52 Like a great, a great channel
00:47:54 if you want something that's like really unbiased
00:47:56 for that is the Rubin report.
00:47:58 I don't know if you guys ever, you've been heard about it.
00:47:59 Oh yeah, I'm familiar with him.
00:48:00 But he just interviews people from like all sides of.
00:48:03 You know what they say, never rub another man's Rubin.
00:48:07 He is gay.
00:48:09 That's true.
00:48:09 He would rub his own Rubin.
00:48:13 I don't get it.
00:48:14 But I think the problem is that
00:48:16 when you have someone like a Saigon of a card
00:48:18 and guys like that, is that because it's become their job
00:48:21 they have to kind of keep placating to their audience.
00:48:23 So I think that's a real thing.
00:48:25 That's a real thing.
00:48:26 Oh man, even if they don't realize it, that happens.
00:48:28 That fucking steams me up.
00:48:29 That fucking, yeah, because like,
00:48:30 because their commenters are all people
00:48:32 that agree with them and are in their fucking echo chamber
00:48:35 and they, and because they're surrounded by people
00:48:38 that like love them and believe in what they're doing,
00:48:40 they're like, yes, what I'm doing is good.
00:48:43 I'm making a positive contribution to this world
00:48:45 because all my followers and fans think so.
00:48:48 And I don't want to have to stress.
00:48:50 I don't mean to.
00:48:51 Now they're trapped, they're trapped in the cycle
00:48:54 where the way that they make money and be popular
00:48:57 is by hating on the other.
00:49:01 And they're like, they couldn't,
00:49:03 like they have no motivation to do anything else.
00:49:06 They have a monetary incentive not to change their mind.
00:49:10 Yeah, yes.
00:49:11 It doesn't have to be necessarily malicious.
00:49:12 That's so fucking much.
00:49:14 Like imagine a situation if you're any of these guys
00:49:16 and you have two stories to talk about,
00:49:17 one that is like a vindication of Hillary in some way
00:49:21 or one that's about her fucking up in another way.
00:49:23 Like what do you think your audience
00:49:24 is going to want to hear more?
00:49:26 Like that's all it comes down to.
00:49:26 That's like the big problem.
00:49:27 And I mean, it's hard to put the blame squarely on them
00:49:30 just because like, again, like that's how they make their money
00:49:33 and they can't control their audience.
00:49:35 It's not like when your audience is whipped up
00:49:38 into a frenzy, how is it like, you know, like that's,
00:49:40 I agree with the fact that they should be unbiased,
00:49:42 but I never, I've always gotten upset
00:49:45 when people have blamed them for like,
00:49:46 your audience is just circle jerking in the comments.
00:49:49 How dare you?
00:49:49 It's like, well, there you don't control
00:49:50 what the comments are, you know?
00:49:52 It's not something that they do, but unfortunately,
00:49:55 like it's interesting.
00:49:56 There's a guy who does this kind of videos.
00:49:58 His name's Harmful Opinions.
00:49:59 And he-
00:50:00 Yep, I know him.
00:50:01 That guy is a fucking maniac.
00:50:02 He's pretty, he like went against the whole grain
00:50:05 and people have been giving him shit for it,
00:50:06 but he's slowly starting to get people back to his side
00:50:08 because like, there was that app, that candid app,
00:50:10 that everyone was like, this is like a free speech app,
00:50:12 and it wasn't, and he was the only one talking about it,
00:50:14 but everyone else was under contract.
00:50:16 He seemed to be right in the end.
00:50:16 He seemed right.
00:50:17 So, I don't know.
00:50:19 I know way too much about all these people.
00:50:21 Jesus Christ.
00:50:21 Yeah.
00:50:22 Well, you know, it's drama.
00:50:24 It's interesting.
00:50:25 You can't help but admit that, you know,
00:50:28 you click on it because, ooh, what's all this about?
00:50:31 Actually, I wasn't subscribed to drama with these guys
00:50:33 until like three days ago,
00:50:34 and I just unsubbed from everyone.
00:50:36 So I was like, I have more important things to do
00:50:37 than watch all this stuff,
00:50:39 even though like, I'm kind of invested in like,
00:50:42 the whole like social kind of game going on right now,
00:50:45 because I just find it interesting.
00:50:47 Well, see, that gets back to kind of Jesse's point
00:50:49 about like, you know,
00:50:51 should you really concern yourself with it too much?
00:50:53 And like, I say, you know, I don't quite agree.
00:50:55 I don't quite agree.
00:50:56 I think that, I am concerned about like,
00:50:59 yeah, I am concerned about the future
00:51:01 and the way things are going.
00:51:02 And like, this back and forth, sorry to just interrupt,
00:51:06 but I mean, my whole thing is like this,
00:51:08 this cultural back and forth is just perpetuating itself
00:51:11 because everyone's fighting fire with fire, you know,
00:51:13 they're fighting the extremism with more extremism.
00:51:16 Everyone, I mean, I guess your instinct is to think
00:51:19 that the way to combat all these people being wrong
00:51:22 is to be right, but it doesn't matter.
00:51:25 You're not gonna affect anything.
00:51:26 All you're gonna do is make more people go back and forth.
00:51:28 The only way to solve what you do.
00:51:30 The only real solution is to find the people in your life
00:51:34 that you care about and just hang out with them
00:51:37 and be nice and be normal and take yourself out
00:51:39 of this fucking insane war zone of shit-flinging.
00:51:44 Just take yourself out of it.
00:51:45 Oh yeah, see, what if I haven't got any friends?
00:51:49 Then you should die.
00:51:52 Oh no.
00:51:53 Yeah, I think you're right though.
00:51:54 And I can easily see like all these,
00:51:55 oh yeah, all these things,
00:51:56 these people like pawning each other
00:51:57 and coming out with videos,
00:51:58 like whoever you're already on the team of,
00:52:00 you're just gonna get more polarized.
00:52:02 There is not a lot of course correction
00:52:04 so much as deepening of adherence
00:52:07 to one side of the other.
00:52:08 This whole meta-narrative could be solved
00:52:11 if there was just compromise.
00:52:12 Compromise, if both ends of the extremes
00:52:16 could just sit down and just give a little ground,
00:52:18 get a little ground and just like, okay.
00:52:20 You don't have to do that.
00:52:21 But there's no incentive to do that.
00:52:22 Yeah, you know what, there's no financial incentive,
00:52:24 there's no cultural incentive.
00:52:26 Because that's the whole problem
00:52:28 with having this all broadcast on social media
00:52:31 is that shitting on the other person
00:52:33 gets you more attention than trying to solve the problem.
00:52:36 Like does anybody on either side invested
00:52:38 in solving the problem anymore?
00:52:39 Yeah.
00:52:40 Well, I've noticed this, I mean,
00:52:41 it's this kind of like this neutrality shaming again
00:52:45 to get back on that old fucking topic.
00:52:46 Oh dude, yes.
00:52:47 Yeah, it's because, you know, like Centrist
00:52:49 has been made into like a dirty world now.
00:52:52 And it's like, you never see people
00:52:54 just like coming down from like their extreme.
00:52:56 If you see anyone change their mind at all,
00:52:58 it's always I was one extreme and now I'm the other.
00:53:01 I see articles all the time of like,
00:53:02 I was on the alt-right and now I'm fixed
00:53:04 because I'm on this side or I was a social justice ward
00:53:07 and now I'm fixed because I'm on the other side.
00:53:09 And it's like, no, you're not fixed.
00:53:10 You just look like to another cancer.
00:53:13 You just treated one cancer for another.
00:53:15 Dude, it's that horseshoe theory, dude.
00:53:16 It's that horseshoe theory that you offer
00:53:18 the size of the spectrum resembling.
00:53:19 It all comes back to drowning in horseshoes,
00:53:22 the greatest YouTube channel video thing of all time.
00:53:25 It all comes back to that.
00:53:26 Horseshoe will never finally be solved.
00:53:28 The most fucking prophetic, brilliant,
00:53:31 artistic vision ever created by mankind.
00:53:35 There's this thing that if you're a centrist,
00:53:37 then what you are to the left is too far right and a racist.
00:53:41 Or if you're a centrist to the left,
00:53:43 then you're a fucking Nazi.
00:53:46 It's almost as if like the horseshoe is endless.
00:53:51 I'm a bitch!
00:53:54 The war is finally coming together.
00:53:56 We finally are cracking the code.
00:53:57 But yeah, it's like, because I mean,
00:54:00 if you're a centrist, then you're both sides' worst enemy.
00:54:03 You're everything to everybody that they,
00:54:05 you're every villain they want to paint you as.
00:54:08 Because I mean, I make a lot of opinion-based videos,
00:54:10 not because I particularly care about my opinion,
00:54:12 but because it's like a launching pad for comedy for me.
00:54:16 But you know, I can't help but have opinions.
00:54:19 I can't help but say stuff.
00:54:20 I fucking say things.
00:54:22 But because I am more towards the center,
00:54:25 I guess, on most things.
00:54:27 It's like, you know, I'm hated by everyone in the world.
00:54:31 That's why people fucking hate me so much.
00:54:33 I've been called a social justice warrior.
00:54:36 More times than I can count,
00:54:37 I've been called a fucking whatever the opposite-
00:54:39 You said that being puppy cat comic.
00:54:40 That was pretty-
00:54:41 I've been called an alt-right, like a Nazi.
00:54:44 More times than I can.
00:54:44 I've been called everything by both sides.
00:54:46 Yeah, fucking, I've been called the social justice word
00:54:48 because I did a video complaining
00:54:50 that there was a page bent in my being puppy cat comic.
00:54:53 You're a monster!
00:54:54 Like half the comments were like,
00:54:56 Oh, you read that fucking SDW trash unsubscribed.
00:55:00 What the fuck is this?
00:55:00 It's a comic about a girl with a cat.
00:55:02 I just wanted to read it.
00:55:03 It's because, all right, that's the thing.
00:55:04 That's what happens to all conversations.
00:55:06 They boil down to like the most like drama-y issue
00:55:10 about that thing.
00:55:11 Like what do we, what do you think of when you think of like-
00:55:13 Nobody is talking about the real issues,
00:55:14 which is that I was sold a comic
00:55:15 with a fucking weird bent page in it.
00:55:17 That when I unbent it,
00:55:19 it was like longer than the other pages.
00:55:20 How did it even get printed that way?
00:55:22 I don't know.
00:55:23 It's a mystery.
00:55:24 This is a thing that's very much on my mind these days.
00:55:27 Like the new Ghost in the Shell movie came out recently.
00:55:30 Like all anyone ever fucking talked about
00:55:32 was that Scarlett Johansson was cast as Motoko Kusanagi
00:55:35 or as the major whatever.
00:55:36 Like that drives me up the fucking wall
00:55:38 because the intellectual content of Ghost in the Shell
00:55:42 is the most interesting thing in the world.
00:55:44 And all anyone's fucking talking about
00:55:46 is the race of the main character.
00:55:48 You're missing the entire fucking point of the thing.
00:55:50 I do think it's saying-
00:55:51 It really fucking sucks and makes me mad
00:55:53 that they made them all white, but whatever.
00:55:55 That's not important.
00:55:56 That's not important.
00:55:56 Well, I just think it's far, far more important
00:56:00 to talk about transhumanism.
00:56:02 I would kind of find it hilarious.
00:56:04 Her name's fucking Kusanagi.
00:56:05 Why the fuck is she white?
00:56:06 Never mind.
00:56:07 Look, I'll tell you all about it.
00:56:09 Shut up, I will say something.
00:56:11 Yeah, okay.
00:56:12 That fucking once you're training, it's paying off.
00:56:14 Yes, yes, yes.
00:56:16 Breathe in, son.
00:56:18 All right, I was gonna say it was just a joke,
00:56:21 but I was gonna say it would be legitimately hilarious
00:56:24 and I would love it if they went too far with the thing
00:56:29 and they made the entire Avengers,
00:56:31 but everyone's a black guy or everyone's a black woman.
00:56:34 And it would just be like-
00:56:35 Dude, give Marvel the Avengers,
00:56:36 they're working on this to comics.
00:56:38 Yeah, they can make a Ghostbusters remake with all the women.
00:56:42 Oh, God, that would never work.
00:56:43 That wouldn't make any sense.
00:56:45 It's a man's story about a man's business
00:56:47 and a man finding a place in the world.
00:56:50 Women have no place in the workforce.
00:56:52 That movie would never work.
00:56:53 Yeah, you know, really?
00:56:54 I would just plain the legend of Zelda.
00:56:56 You may have heard of it
00:56:57 and when you said that, the controller dropped out of my hand.
00:57:01 What do you think you're talking about?
00:57:04 But games.
00:57:08 I am the most blue-pilled.
00:57:09 I am the most blue-pilled.
00:57:11 Ghostbusters, the remake is my favorite movie.
00:57:15 Coming soon, the Avengers, the Spike Lee joint.
00:57:18 What do you think about the whole thing
00:57:22 where if you've got a team of dudes, it is now-
00:57:25 Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's a real problematic premise
00:57:28 for a movie.
00:57:29 That doesn't pass the Bec Del Test,
00:57:30 even one little bit, buddy.
00:57:32 I didn't even mean all men, I just meant people.
00:57:34 I just used the word dudes.
00:57:35 Well, that's problematic too.
00:57:36 I know that's problematic.
00:57:37 So if you've got a bunch of people in any group or whatever,
00:57:41 it's now expected that the ratios will be like,
00:57:45 okay, you can have one white guy,
00:57:47 and then you want one of each race.
00:57:48 Yeah, tokenism.
00:57:50 Right, tokenism, but the thing is,
00:57:52 well, what I'm talking about, tokenism is one issue,
00:57:53 but I'm just saying, the fact of the matter is,
00:57:56 like white people are roughly 60% of America right now,
00:58:00 so you'd expect there to be
00:58:02 roughly 60% representation in whatever.
00:58:05 But that doesn't seem to be acceptable anymore.
00:58:07 You know what I'm saying?
00:58:08 This gets to the heart of the issue of representation,
00:58:12 which is like, I think that it would be pretty swell
00:58:15 if everyone was more or less equally represented,
00:58:19 but I also think that it sucks when people are like,
00:58:22 let's have our cast of characters, they're all white.
00:58:26 We gotta make some black ones.
00:58:27 We gotta make some gay ones.
00:58:29 We gotta do that.
00:58:30 Like, I hate that, and it's terrible.
00:58:32 I hate when those decisions are made for a good reason
00:58:34 that isn't artistic.
00:58:35 Everyone thinks that everyone, yeah.
00:58:36 Everyone, no, no, no, wait, wait, let's talk, let's talk.
00:58:38 Let me see, let me see.
00:58:39 I'm just saying, I hate it that the playing field is skewed,
00:58:41 but I think that the measures taken
00:58:44 to deliberately unskiew it are skeevy and almost worse.
00:58:47 It just seems like everyone thinks the way to empower
00:58:50 one group is to disenfranchise or tear down another.
00:58:54 Could Tom repeat a statement,
00:58:55 because that's like my favorite thing.
00:58:56 Can you say that again, Tom?
00:58:58 I forgot what I said.
00:58:59 Well, you just said like, you hate that any decision
00:59:02 is made for a good reason.
00:59:03 Oh, any decision and anything is made for any reason
00:59:04 other than artistic reasons.
00:59:05 And that's, you know what?
00:59:06 It almost, it's almost like this makes me
00:59:09 almost like approaching racists sometimes.
00:59:12 That sounds terrible, but let me explain.
00:59:14 When they take something, you know,
00:59:19 like when they recast a character
00:59:22 and make always a black guy now,
00:59:23 or they just have like a black guy in like something
00:59:26 or any sort of like non-white person.
00:59:28 Now, because like social justice is everywhere
00:59:30 and I know about and I can't get out of my head,
00:59:32 I always have to think, was this an artistic decision
00:59:35 or are they playing the fucking SJW card?
00:59:37 Yeah, that sucks because sometimes.
00:59:38 And I can't appreciate their performance anymore.
00:59:41 I just want to appreciate art.
00:59:42 Fuck you for making you have to even think that shit.
00:59:44 I know you're gonna say it.
00:59:45 I want to say it.
00:59:46 Let me say it.
00:59:47 I'm gonna say the exact same thing you're gonna say.
00:59:48 Fine.
00:59:49 Thank you.
00:59:51 Okay, there are some times we're fucking like,
00:59:54 oh, like, oh, I'm a corporate exec.
00:59:56 I have money in my pockets.
00:59:58 Let's go do it.
01:00:00 Put the black people there.
01:00:01 Well, most of the time I would argue
01:00:04 is that that's what the guy, he wants it to do.
01:00:07 Like, I like black people.
01:00:08 I'll put a black guy here.
01:00:09 Yeah, sometimes it's good.
01:00:11 Sometimes it's good, but the times.
01:00:13 Because that's what Hillary wants.
01:00:14 Sometimes it's good, but then like,
01:00:16 there's the other times when like,
01:00:18 it's clearly tokenism and that makes it all bad.
01:00:21 But Jesse, let me break up an example.
01:00:23 Let me break up an example real quick.
01:00:24 And it's one Jesse told me about.
01:00:25 So in the Dark Tower movie they're making,
01:00:28 like they're making the main character dude
01:00:30 played by a black guy, but in the original,
01:00:32 and so I guess they're making a change artistically.
01:00:35 And that's not a big deal in and of itself,
01:00:36 but like, there are issues
01:00:38 where there is a black female character
01:00:40 that has very specific race-based relations
01:00:43 with the main character that are now fucked.
01:00:45 Like what is the, the entire arc of like the third book
01:00:48 is Dettel Walker and Odetta Holmes.
01:00:53 She's like, she's two people.
01:00:54 She's a split personality.
01:00:55 But like the whole arc of her character
01:00:57 in the third book is her, you know,
01:00:59 kind of getting over her prejudice and racism
01:01:01 because she grew up in fucking like segregated
01:01:03 60s world against Roland, this old white ass
01:01:07 Clint Eastwood looking motherfucker gunslinger.
01:01:09 And like that's her arc.
01:01:11 I mean, I don't even know if she's gonna be in the movie,
01:01:12 but it's-
01:01:13 Wait, the black person has to get over their racism
01:01:16 towards the white person?
01:01:17 Yeah, we can't have that.
01:01:18 That doesn't make sense.
01:01:19 That doesn't make sense.
01:01:20 That doesn't make sense.
01:01:21 Guys, the obvious answer is we're just gonna make
01:01:23 the black girl a white girl
01:01:25 and then it'll be exactly as good.
01:01:27 Whoa, whoa, no, no, no, no, no.
01:01:28 You cannot have a white woman or any white character
01:01:30 ever upset with the race of another person.
01:01:32 That's not allowed.
01:01:33 It's not allowed.
01:01:34 What I hate about the, like the race-baiting
01:01:37 in like Hollywood casting,
01:01:38 because I see it a lot and it's not just that they do it,
01:01:41 but like the dishonesty and the like outright lies
01:01:45 from everyone involved, like you'll have like,
01:01:48 like when they cast Hermione as a black chick in the-
01:01:51 I was just gonna bring that up.
01:01:52 Yeah, like-
01:01:53 I was just gonna bring that up.
01:01:54 Like J.K. Rowling being like,
01:01:55 well I never said she wasn't black.
01:01:57 Like, yes you fucking did!
01:01:58 You literally slid the buck.
01:02:00 Yeah, it hurts you really?
01:02:01 I think she tweeted.
01:02:02 I think she tweeted like, you know,
01:02:04 it never says she's not black.
01:02:06 Yeah, but you know, because she's,
01:02:08 all it says is like she's got frizzy hair.
01:02:09 Shut up, J.K. Rowling.
01:02:11 Like, there's other characters in the book,
01:02:13 like Blaise Zambini and that guy who fucking,
01:02:16 the Gryffindor who reads the fucking announcements
01:02:18 at the Quidditch, that's explicitly called them black.
01:02:22 If Hermione was black, you would have said black,
01:02:24 because you said that about other characters.
01:02:26 Don't fucking lie to me.
01:02:27 Yeah, you're right.
01:02:28 Yeah, and I kind of should be raising my thing for you.
01:02:30 She did the same thing with Dumbledore.
01:02:31 She did the same fucking thing with Dumbledore,
01:02:32 pretending that he was gay all along.
01:02:34 No, he fucking wasn't.
01:02:36 You don't even know what being gay means, J.K. Rowling,
01:02:38 because Dumbledore is clearly asexual,
01:02:42 and he had a crush on a guy one time like 70 years ago,
01:02:45 and you're like, oh yeah, he's gay.
01:02:47 He's always been gay.
01:02:49 J.K. Rowling, you-
01:02:50 That's just so they can check the gay character box.
01:02:52 That's what they want to do.
01:02:53 Exactly, that's what they want.
01:02:53 You fucking cuck.
01:02:54 Don't pretend like this was your grand plan.
01:02:57 You, ooh, I love your work, but I hate you so much.
01:03:00 Hey, guys, I'm excited to meet you.
01:03:02 Can I just bring up one more example?
01:03:04 Wait, it's kind of, it's kind of gone.
01:03:07 That kind of reminds me of a, of a, of a-
01:03:10 Fuck, kill me.
01:03:12 I feel so Caucasian.
01:03:14 Shut up.
01:03:15 I'm sorry.
01:03:16 Homestuck's important.
01:03:17 Homestuck, right?
01:03:18 Like, fan art, I've seen like, like every single character
01:03:21 in every single color.
01:03:22 And at first I was like, ah, that's, I thought,
01:03:25 mm, I didn't, mm, I guess that, ooh.
01:03:27 It's like, I wasn't sure about it,
01:03:29 and they hadn't been explicit,
01:03:30 because like, all the characters are like,
01:03:32 literally like, ff, ff, ff, ff, ff, white.
01:03:34 Right, right.
01:03:35 Because that's just the, the style of the thing.
01:03:37 But then the-
01:03:37 They're supposed to pay respects, ff, ff.
01:03:38 But then there are the, yeah,
01:03:40 then there are the trolls, which are like gray,
01:03:41 so they have a skin color.
01:03:43 Right, right.
01:03:44 And then is, are all the other characters white?
01:03:46 And some people say, well, it's up to interpretation.
01:03:48 And then it's like, I guess.
01:03:51 Hussey says like, yeah, you know,
01:03:53 I never said they're white,
01:03:55 like it's open to interpretation.
01:03:57 And the response, like the shitty response to that is like,
01:04:00 oh yeah, but they're white-coded.
01:04:02 And then, and then that gets into like,
01:04:04 okay, well what is white-coding?
01:04:05 Like, what is a white person supposed to be?
01:04:07 What behaviors signal a white person to you?
01:04:10 And like-
01:04:11 Oh, you know, I'm a superior intellect.
01:04:13 It's just that I remember that it sort of,
01:04:15 it sort of rubbed me, rubbed me the wrong way initially,
01:04:17 but now I'm totally cool with it.
01:04:19 Like, if I see like, somebody does a fan out of sands
01:04:21 or something, and he's like, he's a human sands,
01:04:23 and he's like, you know,
01:04:24 he's got all these weird tumbler things.
01:04:26 Oh, are you talking about human tail?
01:04:29 Yes, that's a similar sort of thing,
01:04:31 where people tumbler things,
01:04:33 they love attributing characters for things,
01:04:35 making them human, and then giving them a bunch of shit,
01:04:37 and it's like-
01:04:38 You know what fucking grinds my gears anymore?
01:04:40 About human tail, what grinds my fucking gears
01:04:43 is how they do this thing where they're like,
01:04:44 assigning sexualities to each character,
01:04:47 where like, that's not evident in their,
01:04:49 like, okay, like-
01:04:50 Well, here's the thing, here's the thing with that.
01:04:51 Pretty clearly gay, or bi, or something.
01:04:53 But like, we don't know that Frisk
01:04:55 is a weird pansexual demi-
01:04:57 Demi-boy.
01:04:57 Demi-boy.
01:04:58 That's not evident.
01:04:59 Yeah.
01:05:00 My point is that it used to rub me the wrong way,
01:05:02 but I realized they're just having fun,
01:05:04 so I don't really care.
01:05:05 So I just let them have their fun.
01:05:06 Yeah, I mean, to that extent, yeah.
01:05:08 Real quick, I'm rereading it as we speak,
01:05:11 and the only character so far
01:05:13 that has been canonically white has been Bro.
01:05:17 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:05:17 I mean, he's been stated that he's been white.
01:05:19 Yeah.
01:05:20 Oh, okay.
01:05:21 That does happen.
01:05:21 So, Dave-
01:05:22 From that, we know that his genes were given to both,
01:05:25 you know, Roxy and-
01:05:26 Spoilers.
01:05:27 Oh, yeah.
01:05:28 Spoilers.
01:05:30 Homestuck, guys.
01:05:31 Welcome to the Homestuck PCP.
01:05:33 So we know that Dave and Rose are both at least half white.
01:05:38 This is what we know.
01:05:39 What the fuck is homestuck?
01:05:41 No one knows, dude.
01:05:43 Can I just bring up-
01:05:44 Good.
01:05:45 Let me bring up just one more example
01:05:46 that always bothered me, and then we can move on.
01:05:48 And it was just in The Witcher 3,
01:05:50 The Witcher 3, I'm a Pollock.
01:05:52 I'm a Pollock.
01:05:53 My people are from that land.
01:05:56 It's a story made by Polish people about Polish lore,
01:06:00 and there aren't, I mean, in the 16th century
01:06:03 or whatever the fuck,
01:06:04 there were not a lot of non-Polish people,
01:06:07 non-white people,
01:06:08 and when people see that game,
01:06:10 so imagine you're playing this game,
01:06:12 you play through it,
01:06:13 and all you see are white people,
01:06:14 and imagine getting mad that this game
01:06:17 did not have people who don't belong here historically?
01:06:20 This leads in directly to what I wanted to say.
01:06:22 You know what fucking pisses me off
01:06:23 and what I hate about people?
01:06:25 SJW or otherwise.
01:06:26 I hate, fucking hate, how for some reason,
01:06:30 some people have to be like,
01:06:32 I can't relate to anything unless they look like me.
01:06:35 What the fuck is wrong with you?
01:06:37 Yeah, I know you're 100%.
01:06:38 Those people need to be beaten up badly.
01:06:40 I don't know if I agree.
01:06:44 I mean, yeah, I think you probably,
01:06:46 I mean, I think you should be able to identify-
01:06:49 Ben!
01:06:49 Let me finish, let me finish.
01:06:50 I think you should be able to identify
01:06:52 with a protagonist of any race.
01:06:54 But I think if you lived in a world
01:06:57 where like all the movies you watched,
01:06:59 like everyone was Asian and you were a white guy,
01:07:01 like even if there were other white guys around-
01:07:03 I watch fucking anime.
01:07:04 I think you would feel, well, that's different.
01:07:07 I think you would feel weird.
01:07:08 I think it, I really think it would affect
01:07:10 how you saw yourself.
01:07:12 You know what, okay, here's the thing.
01:07:14 I don't know if people might get mad at me about this.
01:07:16 Well, it's related.
01:07:17 It's that I think, yeah, I think you should be able
01:07:21 to relate to a protagonist of any race in theory,
01:07:23 but it's like when it's systemic
01:07:25 and when it's like, when there's broad trends,
01:07:28 like broad trends affect in this sort of thing,
01:07:30 affect how people feel and think.
01:07:32 Okay, well-
01:07:33 So you're saying it's okay for them to get mad
01:07:35 at something that's historically accurate?
01:07:37 What?
01:07:38 No.
01:07:39 I'm talking like the Witcher 3, like the Witchers, yeah.
01:07:41 Cause it's like the Bechdel test, right?
01:07:43 Like the fact that a movie does not pass the Bechdel test,
01:07:46 does not in and of itself make it a bad movie,
01:07:49 it's the fact that like so few movies
01:07:51 pass the Bechdel test.
01:07:52 That means that none of these individual movies
01:07:54 are necessarily damned and like a bad movie
01:07:56 because they don't pass it,
01:07:57 but it's the fact that this widespread trend
01:08:00 is like speaks to like a systemic problem.
01:08:03 Well, all right.
01:08:04 Same with like, and same with the overwhelming whiteness
01:08:07 of like protagonists in movies, that's what I'm saying.
01:08:10 Okay, but like, all right, with Witcher 3 specifically,
01:08:14 would you say that the solution to that anger
01:08:17 is to let them be angry and not change it
01:08:19 or to change the game and add different races in
01:08:21 even though they wouldn't make sense?
01:08:23 No, you should let them be angry
01:08:24 because in that case it makes sense
01:08:25 that everyone would be white.
01:08:27 Yeah, okay.
01:08:28 Right, right.
01:08:29 Well, here's the thing.
01:08:31 I don't know if I'm gonna get in trouble with saying this,
01:08:33 but like I sort of agree with Ben in at least a sense
01:08:39 because I mean, just one way I think about this
01:08:42 is I watch movies about, you know,
01:08:45 people who are from different cultures than me
01:08:47 and like I definitely can relate to it less
01:08:49 than I do to like a middle American, you know, story
01:08:52 or whatever, and as well as like,
01:08:54 I've moved to a mostly black neighborhood now
01:08:57 and like it's just like a sort of a different culture
01:08:59 around like, I grew up around like 99% white people.
01:09:03 Yeah, I'm a little white boy.
01:09:05 And like the neighborhood I live in now is just different
01:09:08 and it's not that the people are necessarily different,
01:09:10 it's just like when I'm in this neighborhood now
01:09:12 and if I see a black person, I just,
01:09:14 I know that they're like, or I don't know,
01:09:17 but like it's an indicator
01:09:18 because I'm a visual oriented creature as a human being,
01:09:21 it makes me think like, okay,
01:09:22 this person is from like a different culture than me
01:09:24 because this place I live now is different.
01:09:26 They're not the same sort of thing
01:09:28 that I've known my whole life.
01:09:29 So like there, and I'm, yeah, like I'm assuming
01:09:32 because I don't actually know this person,
01:09:34 but it's just sort of a hint
01:09:35 that there's a difference here.
01:09:36 And yeah, that's probably not, you know,
01:09:38 I hope I don't sound horrible here, but it's just a fact.
01:09:41 Like, you know, I agree.
01:09:42 Like, like, I'm like, I don't really feel,
01:09:45 I don't really feel like I'm racist at all,
01:09:47 but like, with it, when I feel a cultural,
01:09:50 well, like it's not about how people look,
01:09:51 it's about when I feel a cultural difference.
01:09:53 Like if they're speaking in a way
01:09:55 that is like not how I'm used to speaking,
01:09:56 then I'm like, well, that's different.
01:09:58 I don't know how to relate to that as well, you know?
01:10:00 I don't think there's anything,
01:10:01 is there anything wrong with that though?
01:10:03 I don't, there really is, I don't think so.
01:10:05 Like, I know it's probably, I think it's good,
01:10:08 it's good to be multicultural.
01:10:10 It's good to be multicultural, but like if you're not,
01:10:13 like, I don't think you're a bad person.
01:10:15 Yeah, Ben, what's the point you're trying to make?
01:10:17 Are you saying we, like, I agree with Tom.
01:10:19 I was just agreeing with Nate
01:10:20 that I feel that same way about cultures.
01:10:22 If I agree with Tom and that the artist is always the one
01:10:25 who should decide what the races are, we shouldn't,
01:10:27 like, do you want us to force more races?
01:10:30 He already said no, he already said no.
01:10:31 I said no to that.
01:10:32 Well, then what's the point?
01:10:35 I feel like, what are we even talking about?
01:10:37 Wait a minute, so we're talking about
01:10:40 having more representation in media,
01:10:42 and I think the point right now is that if there's,
01:10:45 but like, my point is that I think that no change
01:10:49 to be made that isn't done for artistic purpose.
01:10:52 And if for whatever reason, all these creators are just like,
01:10:55 this is how we think about it.
01:10:57 I don't think it should be arbitrarily changed
01:10:58 because, well, we need more black people.
01:11:01 I would, I don't, I'm not disagreeing with you
01:11:03 saying that like more, like, diverse cast
01:11:06 would necessarily be a bad thing.
01:11:08 All I'm saying is I want to be done
01:11:09 for natural organic reasons and not to check boxes off.
01:11:12 Here's what I think, I, this is, this is,
01:11:15 this is my opinion on this issue,
01:11:16 and this applies, this applies.
01:11:17 Hippo's been trying to say something, Ben.
01:11:18 What?
01:11:19 Let him say, let Hippo say something,
01:11:20 he's been trying to again.
01:11:22 I mean, it's like too late now, almost,
01:11:23 but I wanted to bring up the fact again,
01:11:26 like you said at the beginning,
01:11:27 I'm the only English guy in this American-centric podcast,
01:11:31 and that the whole thing of like things being unrelatable,
01:11:35 the vast majority of media that I've ever consumed
01:11:37 has been from America and with American things
01:11:40 like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches,
01:11:42 like that, I don't know what the fuck that is.
01:11:44 Taco Bell, we don't have that.
01:11:46 You don't have Taco Bell?
01:11:47 Oh, God.
01:11:48 You poor bastard.
01:11:49 I'm never moving there.
01:11:49 You know, that's Munchie's dad.
01:11:50 Munchie's dad is Taco Bell.
01:11:52 It's like all these American things that have been in like,
01:11:54 you know, every cartoon I've ever watched,
01:11:55 like Rugrats, I don't understand most of the things in that.
01:11:58 I mean, they're babies and they're weird,
01:11:59 but like there's, there's American things in there.
01:12:01 There's American references in all things that I've seen
01:12:04 to the point where I don't find it like,
01:12:08 I don't find it that I can't relate so much
01:12:10 if something is a different culture
01:12:12 because it's just, it's just one of many cultures
01:12:14 that I can relate to in, in that I know that they're different.
01:12:18 I don't really know what like not being,
01:12:20 it not relating to me.
01:12:22 I don't know what that does.
01:12:23 I don't know whether, like if I watch an anime
01:12:25 and it's got Japanese buildings and stuff,
01:12:27 like what does that mean if I can't relate to that thing?
01:12:29 I know, if I see enough anime,
01:12:31 I will be able to relate to it.
01:12:32 If I see enough American things,
01:12:34 I will be able to relate to it, you know, through that.
01:12:37 And then I don't even know what it means
01:12:38 to not relate to something.
01:12:39 What does it even do?
01:12:40 Yeah, Ben, could you,
01:12:41 could you maybe speak to like the damage you see being done
01:12:44 by there being a lack of representation?
01:12:46 Like is it just the level of comfort or something?
01:12:48 No, it's not the, it's not the level of comfort.
01:12:50 I think, I think that if when there's not enough,
01:12:54 when there's not diverse representation,
01:12:56 then it just contributes to an othering effect wherein,
01:13:00 wherein the inside group and the outside group
01:13:02 see themselves as distinct and opposed to one another.
01:13:06 So, okay.
01:13:07 I think that more, I think that,
01:13:09 I think that when media, if media was more inclusive,
01:13:12 then it would mean, it would, it would lessen,
01:13:15 it would lessen that like in and out group psychology.
01:13:18 So how do we do this, Ben?
01:13:20 Do you want, do you want like a government forced diversity
01:13:23 in your TV show or what?
01:13:24 No, here's, here's the best thing.
01:13:26 Here's the best solution I come up with.
01:13:29 No, I wouldn't, I don't think anyone should be,
01:13:32 compelled to do anything or make art any way
01:13:35 that they don't want to.
01:13:36 I think that the only viable solution to this at all,
01:13:39 and it's not great, but it's the best I can come up with is,
01:13:41 I just think that people should try to have,
01:13:45 should try to view novelty like positively
01:13:48 in a way that like, you know, like if you've got two,
01:13:52 I don't know, movies you wanna watch,
01:13:53 and one is like an American film,
01:13:55 and one is like a Pakistani film,
01:13:57 and you've never seen a Pakistani film before
01:13:59 or a film with like, with like a Pakistani director.
01:14:02 Maybe you could be like, oh, well that's neat.
01:14:04 You know, I just think, I think we should look,
01:14:06 I just think, I wish we just looked positively on that,
01:14:08 and I think if societally, we looked positively
01:14:11 on things that come from like diverse cultures,
01:14:13 and a novelty, and a novelty in that way, then I-
01:14:16 Only white movies win Oscars, like Moonlight,
01:14:19 that was an all white movie, just won the best picture.
01:14:21 Well that was like, it's like one dude, it's like one.
01:14:23 Are you fucking kidding me?
01:14:24 Look through the Oscar list of the last 50 fucking years, dude.
01:14:27 I think that should mostly be due to the fact
01:14:30 that the Oscars are bullshit,
01:14:31 and nobody should care about it.
01:14:32 Are you making an argument that they're just,
01:14:33 I'm just wondering, that there is
01:14:35 proportional representation in the Oscars for-
01:14:37 I'm not saying, I'm not saying-
01:14:39 Not you, I'm asking monkey.
01:14:40 Okay, are you saying that society on a whole
01:14:44 doesn't like things that are different,
01:14:45 and I just proved them wrong with the Oscars, I guess.
01:14:48 Well, you didn't actually present anything to say that.
01:14:50 What do you mean, what do you mean,
01:14:51 what is the trend in the Oscars that you're talking about?
01:14:52 I mean, the idea is that if society
01:14:55 doesn't like things that are different,
01:14:57 then the very white Oscar voting people
01:14:59 would only vote for the white movies,
01:15:01 so clearly they do have some-
01:15:02 So, hang on, are you saying that because Moonlight won,
01:15:05 that alone proves that there is no problem?
01:15:07 No, it's an example that shows that Ben
01:15:10 isn't entirely right in what he said.
01:15:11 I think-
01:15:12 I don't think that's true,
01:15:13 because a very small number of people actually decide
01:15:15 who win, and those are big lip cucks,
01:15:16 so first of all, they don't represent America in general,
01:15:19 and that doesn't solve any kind of problems.
01:15:20 It's not just about whiteness,
01:15:22 it's not just about blackness.
01:15:24 I don't know what movies won the Oscars
01:15:26 for the last 50 years,
01:15:27 but I'm betting that there's some noticeable trends
01:15:31 in what kinds of movies win Oscars.
01:15:33 I think-
01:15:34 For instance, they're all self-important and awful.
01:15:37 People like things that are familiar,
01:15:40 like in general, like on a human level,
01:15:42 I don't think you can ever change the entire universe.
01:15:43 And that's not a crime.
01:15:45 Yeah.
01:15:45 Well, I think it should be.
01:15:46 They're gonna like, I mean, yeah,
01:15:48 you can have ideals that we should all be introduced,
01:15:51 mixing and trying out new things,
01:15:55 but the fact of the matter is,
01:15:56 people generally don't care to do that,
01:15:58 and it's hard to try and convince them,
01:16:00 and I don't even know what the problem is anymore.
01:16:03 Okay, Beth, I have a question for you,
01:16:05 since you're kind of a social justice guy,
01:16:07 I wanna kind of satisfy you, okay?
01:16:09 Cause, no, because maybe you'll be on board with me on this
01:16:11 and thinking this is stupid,
01:16:13 because you're saying right now,
01:16:14 people should definitely try and experience more culture,
01:16:17 and go look at other stuff outside of their sphere
01:16:20 and bubble that they're familiar with.
01:16:22 Yeah, it would be nice.
01:16:24 Why is it that the same people who talk about that
01:16:27 also say that cultural appropriation
01:16:28 is the worst thing ever,
01:16:29 and you should stay inside your bubble
01:16:31 and never touch anything?
01:16:31 Cultural appropriation is the best thing ever.
01:16:33 Yeah.
01:16:35 Because it doesn't make any sense
01:16:38 that to get back to social justice worries in general,
01:16:41 I guess, is that, again,
01:16:42 they want all this more representation
01:16:44 of people to understand things outside their culture,
01:16:45 but then as soon as you touch anything else,
01:16:48 they're just like, that's mine, you can't have it.
01:16:50 They're just like, well, you're just raising the barriers
01:16:52 and bitching that there are barriers.
01:16:53 So what the fuck?
01:16:54 Yeah, I hate that.
01:16:56 I think we should all culturally appropriate all the time.
01:16:58 It would be, I wish I culturally appropriated more.
01:17:01 Sometimes I feel bad.
01:17:02 Sometimes I feel bad, like just how fucking white
01:17:05 me and my upbringing and my culture is.
01:17:07 But then I think about branching out,
01:17:09 and I'm like, that sounds hard,
01:17:11 and not doing that is easy.
01:17:14 I would really like more toast in my movies.
01:17:17 You want the government to force people to eat toast?
01:17:21 No, I just think that societally,
01:17:25 we should agree to give toast more money in the box office.
01:17:29 Hey, you know, I had an uncle Phil, right?
01:17:33 And he was white, because, you know,
01:17:35 my family's white, I'm a white boy.
01:17:38 Unfortunately.
01:17:39 Yeah, but I had an uncle Phil,
01:17:41 and that means that I could technically be
01:17:45 a white Will Smith in the Fresh Prince of White Bel Air.
01:17:51 Could I, would it be cool?
01:17:53 Imagine a reboot of Fresh Prince of Bel Air.
01:17:56 Yeah, would it be like cool?
01:17:58 Well, it would not be allowed.
01:18:00 What do you mean it wouldn't be allowed?
01:18:01 My whole thing is like, I don't think that's cool or uncool.
01:18:04 It should just be a thing that happens.
01:18:05 It should be completely neutral.
01:18:06 There should be no, it's just like, whatever.
01:18:08 The thing about that is that the point of Fresh Prince of Bel Air
01:18:12 is that they're an upscale black family
01:18:14 living in a white neighborhood.
01:18:17 Okay, well, for the audience,
01:18:19 but if you switched it,
01:18:21 then it's like a poor white family
01:18:24 moves to a rich black neighborhood.
01:18:26 Is that, that's not a thing.
01:18:28 Well, I don't know.
01:18:29 Maybe nowadays it's a little different,
01:18:30 and maybe it could happen.
01:18:31 That was just being a stupid joke, sir.
01:18:34 Well, I'm fucking, well, I'm taking it way too seriously.
01:18:37 You're welcome.
01:18:38 I do find Carlton a fascinating character though,
01:18:40 because God, one of the best scenes
01:18:42 is when him and Will got pulled over one day
01:18:46 when they were just driving down the road.
01:18:47 And you know, Carlton's been sheltered his whole life,
01:18:49 so he doesn't know about the shit.
01:18:50 And like they were pulled over for driving like too slow
01:18:52 on the side of the highway and like got arrested
01:18:54 and some real shit went down.
01:18:55 And then afterward, like Carlton's just like, Will,
01:18:58 like we were, like, of course the police pulled us over.
01:19:00 Like we were acting suspicious.
01:19:01 And Will's like, dude, if we were white,
01:19:03 never would have fucking happened.
01:19:04 And Carlton, Carlton just does not understand.
01:19:06 Like it's not in his worldview
01:19:08 that the police are discriminating against
01:19:11 in a particular race.
01:19:12 And that is a very interesting phenomenon.
01:19:14 Cause to Will, this is just life.
01:19:15 This is every single day, you know,
01:19:17 he just thinks that that's just how he thinks about shit.
01:19:19 Cops are out to get him.
01:19:20 And Carlton does not process, like his dad's a judge.
01:19:22 So, you know, probably has a more favorable view
01:19:24 of the law system in general.
01:19:25 Cause he, cause Carlton's,
01:19:26 Carlton's got fucking privilege, man.
01:19:28 He's got privilege and he's been sheltered.
01:19:29 And his privilege allows him to,
01:19:31 his privilege allows him to ignore and deny
01:19:34 that privilege exists.
01:19:35 I'm just saying, I would sure like it
01:19:37 if everyone could was in a position with Carlton,
01:19:40 with like, yeah, this doesn't happen.
01:19:41 It would be great if we all could ignore
01:19:44 fucking societal bullshit.
01:19:45 I wish we were all like Carlton.
01:19:46 I wanna, everyone in the world should be like Carlton.
01:19:49 We'd have the best dance moves.
01:19:49 You're that big of a Michael Jackson.
01:19:51 That's true.
01:19:52 That one commercial.
01:19:56 Did Michael Jackson get more privilege
01:19:58 when he turned white?
01:19:59 Did that happen?
01:19:59 No, he actually got more privilege when he turned rich.
01:20:03 Got way less.
01:20:04 I mean, hey, that's how it happens.
01:20:06 Where were you when Michael Jackson died?
01:20:08 I was doing 9-11.
01:20:09 I was doing 9-11.
01:20:16 That's a good one.
01:20:17 Uh-huh.
01:20:19 I actually do remember where I was,
01:20:21 but I don't remember when I was.
01:20:22 If anything disproves the concept of white privilege,
01:20:26 it's that, I mean, Michael Jackson,
01:20:27 he was black and he was successful.
01:20:29 He turns white.
01:20:30 Next thing you know, he's fraying for pedophilia.
01:20:31 He's being assassinated by Sony.
01:20:33 You know, all this horrible stuff is happening.
01:20:35 His legacy is tarnished forever.
01:20:37 Oh, because he was white.
01:20:39 Michael Jackson, yeah.
01:20:40 He had the audacity to turn white.
01:20:43 You know what the real problem with that guy was?
01:20:45 He fucked with Paul McCartney.
01:20:46 He bought a lot of the Beatles music
01:20:48 that Paul wanted.
01:20:49 He was not still alive.
01:20:50 He said he was the Beatles hit squad.
01:20:53 Wait, he bought the Beatles music?
01:20:55 Like he just purchased the albums?
01:20:56 He bought the rights to a lot of the album records music.
01:21:00 And he was like, I don't know,
01:21:01 but I read about it the other day.
01:21:02 And I know that him and Paul McCartney
01:21:04 were not such good friends after that.
01:21:06 But they made a song together.
01:21:08 That was beforehand.
01:21:09 That was beforehand.
01:21:10 Say, say, say, what the fuck?
01:21:13 Do, do, do, oh, yeah, you're a black man.
01:21:18 I'm black.
01:21:20 Da-boo-dee, da-boo-dah.
01:21:21 I'm black if I was white.
01:21:23 I'd have privilege if I was white.
01:21:26 We should make a remix.
01:21:27 So listen up.
01:21:28 Here's a story about a little bitch who fucks with a bitch.
01:21:33 Hey, Nate, do we have any Twitter questions this week?
01:21:36 No, no, no, no, I know.
01:21:37 I have a closing statement.
01:21:38 I want to, I want to, I have a closing statement.
01:21:41 The closing statement of this is,
01:21:44 just know that whatever side you fall on,
01:21:47 there is no, in the words of my personal savior,
01:21:50 Jan Rynkowski, a.k.a. actor of Parkour, dude 91,
01:21:54 there are no anime villains controlling everything.
01:21:56 And everything is, every movement is not a result
01:22:00 of one person maniacally cackling.
01:22:03 They, there's just people reacting
01:22:05 to what they see in the world,
01:22:07 maybe immaturally or maybe materially.
01:22:10 But it is all, it is all people just like you
01:22:12 making decisions to act the way they do.
01:22:15 I just want to say, as a final statement
01:22:18 on the matter of SJWs, that I agree with everyone
01:22:23 and everyone is bad also.
01:22:26 Those are two things, not necessarily conflicting.
01:22:28 And I think in general, people should take themselves
01:22:31 out of it and not give a shit.
01:22:32 But I also think that maybe, and this is something
01:22:35 that I almost wish that I was more capable of doing,
01:22:38 is just go with it, man.
01:22:41 If all your friends are libtard cucks, be a libtard cock.
01:22:44 If all your friends are fucking alt-right,
01:22:46 be an alt-right, doesn't matter.
01:22:48 None of this really truly matters.
01:22:50 Just be what your friends are.
01:22:51 That's all that matters.
01:22:52 And if I could get a baby, fine.
01:22:55 But that's what got us all into this situation
01:22:58 to begin with.
01:22:59 If I could give a final, final statement.
01:23:02 Tonight, we talked a lot about why we shouldn't talk
01:23:05 about SJWs, we had a lot of derailing.
01:23:08 So look forward tomorrow to me and Tom
01:23:10 having a real podcast about SJWs.
01:23:15 What name is it for, Jack?
01:23:16 I want to say, as a final name, this coffin here.
01:23:19 Oh my, I'm with the king day.
01:23:21 Wait a minute, what made this not necessarily
01:23:23 a real conversation on the topic of SJWs?
01:23:25 I think we covered a lot of ground.
01:23:26 I did my level best, Mumki.
01:23:28 I did the best that I could with what I had at the time.
01:23:32 I think it was very early derailed into why
01:23:35 we shouldn't talk about SJWs and how now suddenly everybody
01:23:38 uses the SJW.
01:23:40 I was hoping to get a little bit of nitpicking
01:23:42 into what it actually is, but me and Tom can do it later.
01:23:45 It's been the whole time talking about what it is.
01:23:47 An SJW is like a work of pornography.
01:23:49 You can't define it, but you know it when you see it.
01:23:52 I agree, I agree.
01:23:55 Okay, let's go to the questions.
01:23:58 Okay, what do we got here?
01:24:01 Okay, here's one, just a fast-filler
01:24:02 until I find a good one.
01:24:03 I think Mumki's a little sad that this didn't turn out
01:24:05 to be the echo chamber he particularly wanted.
01:24:09 I just thought we'd have multiple perspectives
01:24:11 represented in, you know.
01:24:13 I think we certainly have multiple perspectives.
01:24:15 We're too intellectually honest,
01:24:18 and we understand each other too well
01:24:20 that we don't devolve into a bunch of shouting and bullshit.
01:24:22 Like, what would you, what would you want to talk about?
01:24:25 This podcast has already been derailed.
01:24:26 We'll do it another time.
01:24:28 The rage, the quietly simmering rage of Mumki.
01:24:32 I don't have time for a three-hour podcast.
01:24:35 I have a date tonight.
01:24:36 Well, congratulations, Destin.
01:24:39 Do you have a time for a two-hour podcast?
01:24:41 It's only been going for like an hour and a half.
01:24:43 Yeah, I'll save it for later, it's fine.
01:24:45 All right, there we go.
01:24:47 Let's go to the fucking questions.
01:24:49 All right, Jesus Christ.
01:24:50 Okay, here's one.
01:24:51 Edwin at Edwin Jart asks,
01:24:54 hey, TB Crasnayers, you become God for exactly 45 seconds.
01:24:58 What do you do?
01:25:00 Make racism legal.
01:25:01 Who else has a good idea? Come on.
01:25:11 Sex isn't legal.
01:25:15 Makes sense.
01:25:16 I remake Evan Almighty and make it good this time.
01:25:20 That's, yeah.
01:25:21 Why are you guys fucking around with laws?
01:25:23 You became God, not like the president.
01:25:25 That's not a law.
01:25:26 Black political.
01:25:27 Black political.
01:25:29 I would buy up all the land in Missouri and then nuke it.
01:25:36 Oh, you know what I do?
01:25:37 Oh, that's a good idea.
01:25:38 Why in Missouri?
01:25:39 What did they do?
01:25:40 I don't know.
01:25:41 I was just thinking of a state.
01:25:42 I don't know what states are.
01:25:43 I'd go for Rhode Island.
01:25:44 Liquid?
01:25:45 I would probably like share.
01:25:46 I would probably like fucking share the secrets of like faster than light travel with humanity
01:25:51 or something.
01:25:52 I was just going to say, what I would do is I would have an alien race like the Vulcans.
01:25:56 I would instruct them to visit Earth because that's what started Starfleet in like the
01:26:01 original.
01:26:02 Right as humans did their first warp drive test.
01:26:04 The Vulcans happened to see them and then they became best friends and everything started
01:26:07 from there.
01:26:08 I think I'd give myself abs.
01:26:09 What hippo were you saying?
01:26:15 I was going to say, if you ask God, your plan was to tell people about the light speed travel.
01:26:21 What if, as God, you realize that it's completely impossible?
01:26:25 Do you tell them?
01:26:26 Yeah.
01:26:27 Oh, absolutely.
01:26:28 Yeah.
01:26:29 Tell them that their dreams are crushed.
01:26:30 Yeah.
01:26:31 I would prove it to them that it's impossible so that they would stop working on it.
01:26:35 Yeah.
01:26:36 Yeah.
01:26:37 I would do that.
01:26:38 It would be great.
01:26:39 Some include things like wormholes though because wormholes aren't really travel.
01:26:40 They're just kind of jumps between pockets.
01:26:41 Whatever steps were necessary to make it happen, I would share them if there were some and
01:26:46 if there weren't, I would let them all know.
01:26:48 Excellent.
01:26:49 Good.
01:26:50 You know, actually I retract all my statements.
01:26:51 I would ask God, I would go around the world and make geography, I would get rid of all
01:26:56 the weird geography related things like Portugal, that should be all Spain, it would look better
01:27:01 on a map, basically, I would get rid of all the small countries because they look bad
01:27:07 on maps.
01:27:08 That's true.
01:27:09 And we'd just simulate them in the bigger countries.
01:27:10 Fuck Luxembourg.
01:27:11 Yeah, exactly.
01:27:12 Like what the fuck?
01:27:13 Luxembourg sounds like some fucking, like a Power Rangers knockoff.
01:27:17 Like the Beetleborgs.
01:27:18 The big bad Luxembourg.
01:27:19 The bad Luxembourg.
01:27:20 The bad Luxembourg.
01:27:21 The bad Luxembourg.
01:27:22 To make racism real.
01:27:23 I thought it was pronounced Luxembourg.
01:27:24 It's fucking Luxembourg.
01:27:25 Get out of here.
01:27:26 The original character Luxembourg.
01:27:27 The cool new character Luxembourg.
01:27:28 Here he comes.
01:27:29 Yeah, fuck yeah.
01:27:30 I thought it was pronounced Luxembourg.
01:27:31 Yeah, but I think Luxembourg.
01:27:32 Lord, naked, you hit me with another.
01:27:33 Yes, okay, here you go.
01:27:34 Let me slang this one for you.
01:27:35 Fuck where'd it go?
01:27:47 Oh, here it is.
01:27:48 At Swagdude.
01:27:49 Yeah, at Swagdude.
01:27:50 Oh, it's Swagdude.
01:27:51 Yeah, I know him.
01:27:52 What's your favorite soda?
01:27:53 And I just want to quote Anthony Fantano and say, soda's piss water is bliss.
01:28:01 Don't drink it.
01:28:02 It's garbage.
01:28:03 Poisons your body.
01:28:04 I hate soda.
01:28:05 True that poisons your body, but it tastes very good sometimes.
01:28:09 If monster counts as soda, then monster.
01:28:12 But only the zero calorie.
01:28:13 It doesn't.
01:28:14 It's an energy.
01:28:15 Okay, then Coke zero.
01:28:16 It's clearly lead.
01:28:17 Hey, that's a great, you know, topic for this podcast because we were talking about SJ
01:28:21 Doubles at CWs.
01:28:22 You know, it would solve all the social ills of the world right now is a nice cool bottle
01:28:27 of Pepsi, you know.
01:28:29 Topical.
01:28:30 Topical.
01:28:31 Give me that Pepsi.
01:28:32 I'm CEO of Pepsi.
01:28:33 I'm a baby.
01:28:34 I have millions of dollars.
01:28:35 I'm your Pepsi.
01:28:36 Yeah.
01:28:37 That's what the riot control police say when you bring them a Pepsi and, you know, they're
01:28:46 beating on the blacks and they're beating on the everyone.
01:28:49 I hate blacks.
01:28:50 But I kill people until I get my Pepsi.
01:28:54 Someone give me a Pepsi and cut this hatred out of me and wash my hatred away in an ocean
01:29:04 of Pepsi inside my body.
01:29:06 We made a terrible mistake.
01:29:10 What we should have done at the beginning of this podcast was so that we know how important
01:29:13 everyone's points are, is compare ourselves on the, what is it, the progressive stack?
01:29:17 On the Pepsi scale, which we are.
01:29:19 Yeah, that's what I wanted.
01:29:20 I wanted us to be ranked, but it'll never fucking happen.
01:29:24 That's a number bonus episode.
01:29:26 Yeah.
01:29:27 Five dollars, motherfuckers.
01:29:30 I'm going to say that I think the number one would have to go to Munchy because he's
01:29:33 the most non-white.
01:29:34 So that puts it up pretty high.
01:29:36 But he's also the least gay.
01:29:38 So that's pretty, that's pretty serious.
01:29:42 You know, Ben, I think I might be the least autistic.
01:29:46 Yeah, well, somebody's got to.
01:29:48 Just maybe, just maybe.
01:29:50 Okay, what do we got here?
01:29:51 Oh, wait, no, no, no.
01:29:52 I have to say my favorite sodas because I'm a soda enthusiast.
01:29:55 I like to try, I'm very cultured.
01:29:57 I like to try a bunch of different sodas.
01:29:59 I always compare tastes.
01:30:00 I'm very into suicides.
01:30:02 Like as in like mixing drinks, not as in killing yourself, which I am staunchly against.
01:30:07 What the fuck is this?
01:30:08 I don't know.
01:30:09 What?
01:30:10 The sodas?
01:30:11 Yeah.
01:30:12 Oh, I'm way into that.
01:30:13 That sounds cool.
01:30:14 That's when you mix all of them like at McDonald's.
01:30:17 Yeah.
01:30:18 Oh, all right.
01:30:19 And I say, I say that the best, the best soda in the world is as follows.
01:30:26 All right, 60% Dr. Pepper, 30% fucking root beer, and the rest Sprite.
01:30:34 Hmm.
01:30:35 It's pretty good.
01:30:36 Did you know that if you mix Coke and Sprite, you get ginger ale?
01:30:40 How would I have any way to test that, Jerry?
01:30:44 I'm fucking gay.
01:30:47 Kill me.
01:30:48 I'm gay.
01:30:49 I want to die.
01:30:50 Oh my god.
01:30:51 I know they said it on Seinfeld.
01:30:52 That's why I know it.
01:30:53 What of it?
01:30:54 What of it?
01:30:55 Yeah.
01:30:56 I'm Seinfeld.
01:30:57 And there's George, too.
01:30:58 I'm Seinfeld.
01:30:59 I lie, I'm a Jew.
01:31:00 And there's George.
01:31:01 Okay.
01:31:02 Wow.
01:31:03 He's not a Cuban, Homer Simpson, just Undertale.
01:31:07 Nice.
01:31:08 Did you guys, did you guys, wait, are you guys talking about Simpsons Meet Undertale?
01:31:13 Yep, I am.
01:31:14 Yep, yep.
01:31:15 Is that a real thing?
01:31:16 Is that real?
01:31:17 It's the worst.
01:31:18 It's the worst.
01:31:19 Oh my god.
01:31:20 It's so bad.
01:31:21 It's fucking dumb.
01:31:22 I'm ashamed, I'm ashamed that we've mentioned it on the hallowed halls of the PCP.
01:31:25 It's wrong.
01:31:26 Just tell me what meat, is it a video?
01:31:27 Is that what it is?
01:31:28 It's just like a little like one minute shitty animation.
01:31:30 Okay.
01:31:31 Okay.
01:31:32 It's fucking amazing.
01:31:33 Oh shit.
01:31:34 I'm subscribing.
01:31:35 I'm subscribing.
01:31:36 So Monkey Away at Monkey Away asks, is watching shit in a theater ever worth it?
01:31:42 That's an interesting question.
01:31:44 I would have to say yes.
01:31:45 Totally.
01:31:46 Because I enjoyed my time in a theater just the other day.
01:31:48 Yeah.
01:31:49 If you're with friends.
01:31:50 I was alone.
01:31:51 I'm always alone.
01:31:52 I guess it could be.
01:31:53 It's not a joke.
01:31:54 I wouldn't do it alone, but I guess it could be fun.
01:31:56 I mean, you should definitely go at least once to get the experience of a huge screen
01:32:00 with a loud speaker in a big old dark room.
01:32:02 Dude, if you wait a couple of weeks, so there's no one else in the theater, it's the best
01:32:06 possible way to watch a movie.
01:32:08 That is totally true.
01:32:09 I agree.
01:32:10 I think the percentage of worth it your theater experiences is directly proportional to how
01:32:17 good or shitty your TV setup at home is.
01:32:20 I agree.
01:32:21 I like the emcee of the theater.
01:32:23 I like movie dogs.
01:32:24 I like watching people, like with people around.
01:32:26 I like watching, you know, I like having, it's a full ritual.
01:32:29 They've ruined, like, 80% of the movies.
01:32:33 Here's what I would say.
01:32:35 Yeah, I'm kind of a solitary watcher myself.
01:32:37 The optimal, like, movie going experience.
01:32:39 Like, unless it's like something that you want to page engine to and like analyze and
01:32:43 it's like, oh, it's a really heady fucking, like Scooby-Doo or something.
01:32:46 Like, you want to watch that alone and get the bullshit.
01:32:48 But if it's just some bullshit like Ghost in the Shell, you can go with your friends.
01:32:53 And if we live in a perfect world, then I think the perfect place would be like a movie theater,
01:32:59 but only you and your friends are allowed.
01:33:01 So you can like scream and like make fun of the movie for bullshit.
01:33:04 But you still get all the comfort and like the movie dogs and like the blackness.
01:33:07 I see what you're saying.
01:33:09 Yeah, I don't ever do anything with my friends.
01:33:11 The theater experience can also sort of revitalize an old favorite.
01:33:14 You know, if you have one of those movie theaters that play old movies in your town, you know,
01:33:19 like you can go in there, you can watch like The Room, or you can watch like The Pals.
01:33:22 Yeah, that's the one.
01:33:23 Me and Nate went with some people to a screening of The Room one time.
01:33:27 And it was fucking great.
01:33:29 That was fucking downtown Boston.
01:33:31 It was the best atmosphere.
01:33:32 At the Coolidge.
01:33:33 I had the most fun.
01:33:34 At Coolidge Corner.
01:33:35 At Coolidge Corner.
01:33:36 Yeah.
01:33:37 And we fucking, we threw spoons at the screen.
01:33:39 That was so much fun.
01:33:40 It was great.
01:33:41 I loved every second of it.
01:33:42 It was great.
01:33:43 It's like one of those Rocky Heart Picture Show things.
01:33:46 Yeah, it was so much fun.
01:33:47 Everyone there was into it ruled.
01:33:49 Ruled.
01:33:50 Yeah.
01:33:51 Give me another one, Nate.
01:33:54 Okay, here's an appropriate question for now.
01:33:56 I'm your commentator.
01:33:57 I eat questions and comments.
01:33:59 At Cloudy Chain asks, are you planning on ending the PCP anytime soon?
01:34:04 Yes, I know.
01:34:05 I've been fucking begging.
01:34:07 People don't even know.
01:34:08 I've been like bringing this up every week begging.
01:34:10 Please guys, can we vote for it to end?
01:34:12 Please, let it end.
01:34:14 The Patriot has only just begun.
01:34:16 We have to keep going forever.
01:34:18 All artistic integrity has to be sacrificed.
01:34:20 It should be our last Patreon goal at the end of the PCP.
01:34:23 Just when I...
01:34:24 We should set that like a hundred grand.
01:34:27 Yeah.
01:34:28 Just when I thought I was out, they started the Patreon and now I'm still here for them.
01:34:33 The PCP is voluntary, Jesse.
01:34:35 That's the only reason we're here.
01:34:37 The fans of the Skriller are too important to me.
01:34:41 He's...
01:34:42 What a hero.
01:34:43 I'm a true martyr for this fucking podcast.
01:34:47 Okay, the rest of these questions are shit.
01:34:49 At JerJot...
01:34:51 Wait, JerJerRod asks,
01:34:53 Best Gavra, do you recommend the can of beans lunch diet?
01:34:55 Absolutely.
01:34:56 It's fucking awesome.
01:34:57 Just eat a can of beans.
01:34:58 That's the worst.
01:34:59 That is the worst.
01:35:00 This is coming from me.
01:35:01 This is coming from me who will eat anything.
01:35:03 I would never eat a can of...
01:35:05 I would never eat a can of uncooked kidney beans.
01:35:08 That is the grossest thing I can imagine.
01:35:10 It sounds awesome.
01:35:11 Nate, I have a can of black beans for lunch on the regular.
01:35:14 Pretty awesome.
01:35:15 Good.
01:35:16 You gotta have representation for those black beans.
01:35:19 Yeah.
01:35:20 Baked beans are good with tomato sauce.
01:35:23 Baked beans are good, but they got sugar and shit in them.
01:35:27 We're talking about un-topped, undressed, straight out of the can with nothing.
01:35:33 That's right.
01:35:34 Stop turning the camera around.
01:35:35 In the perfect world, we'd all eat for survival and nothing else.
01:35:37 This whole eating for pleasure...
01:35:39 I disagree.
01:35:40 We're gonna have to bring that into the food cast though.
01:35:42 Oh my God.
01:35:43 I'm very much a pro food.
01:35:45 I didn't even get to talk about how much I fucking hate fat people.
01:35:48 God damn it.
01:35:49 That's the biggest thing.
01:35:50 That's true.
01:35:51 I'm also pro hating fat people.
01:35:53 It's very complicated.
01:35:55 Yeah, so fucking fix your diets people.
01:35:58 Okay, well, that's it.
01:36:00 All the other questions are garbage.
01:36:01 Thanks for watching everybody.
01:36:03 I am an SJW.
01:36:04 I take all the blue pills, but I've also taken red pills.
01:36:07 I'm dying inside.
01:36:08 There's an internal conflict within me.
01:36:09 Thanks for watching everybody.
01:36:10 Everybody sing.
01:36:11 I need my blue pills.
01:36:12 Bye.
01:36:13 I need my blue pills.
01:36:15 I need my blue pills.
01:36:16 I need your pro pills.
01:36:17 Oh my God.
01:36:22 No, we can go for days.
01:36:26 You can leave your kids.
01:36:28 I can't...
01:36:29 I can't do the Loudspeakers anymore.
01:36:33 Hilary?
01:36:34 I'm supposed to be working right now
01:36:39 I'm supposed to be working right now
01:36:44 But I'm not working
01:36:47 I'm doing nothing
01:36:50 My dick I'm jerking
01:36:52 Myself I'm sucking
01:36:55 I am an asshole
01:36:58 I am a stupid
01:37:00 I've got a deadline
01:37:03 Don't wanna do it
