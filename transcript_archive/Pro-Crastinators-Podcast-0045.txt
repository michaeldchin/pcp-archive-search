00:00:00 Hey, what's up, everybody? It's Digibro. I'm not in this episode. I don't even know what this episode's about, but here's a rant I gotta give you.
00:00:07 I'm sick of half measures by society when it comes to germs. Everyone washes their hands all the time after they take a piss.
00:00:16 You don't even really touch anything, but you feel the need to wash your hands. People wash their hands after they touch this and that, when they touch trash, they touch this.
00:00:22 But yet everyone goes to the grocery store and pushes around carts that a thousand other people's hands have been on, and no one washes their hands afterwards.
00:00:29 Or even worries about it. No one puts shit on their hands to grab the cart, even though every fucking sick motherfucker who's been in that place has touched that cart.
00:00:39 If you're touching carts, then you're doing it wrong. You're fucking up, and you're washing your hands after... I don't know what I'm talking about. Here's the episode.
00:00:46 Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Procrastinator's Podcast. I am back. It's just me today. Nobody else is here. I'm the best guy ever.
00:00:56 Creek, it's me. I just walked through the door.
00:00:58 Oh, I didn't... Oh, hey, what do you know? It's, uh...
00:01:01 Don't tell me, but I'm hiding under the table. He doesn't know I'm here. I'm here with the fool.
00:01:06 Oh, is that him? Are you under the table? Is that you?
00:01:09 No, no, I'm not.
00:01:10 Oh, you up-ended the table, god damn it.
00:01:12 Yeah, I see you guys.
00:01:15 Here comes the crappy pants, man!
00:01:19 Everyone's favorite character.
00:01:21 I'm a superhero. No one knows my secret identity. You don't know who I really am. I'm the crappy pants man.
00:01:27 Who could I be? Which mysterious member of the PCP is actually me?
00:01:33 AKA the Pooper Tailor.
00:01:35 Fill it with a shit. The crappy pants man can't do that.
00:01:41 Hey, you kids. What are you all getting up to? It's me, your dad Ben... Your dad Ben St. here, and I've got my... I'm getting my fucking belt off, kids.
00:01:50 No. Okay dad, I'll do our homework. Don't take my belt off. My pants are the only things keeping in my crap.
00:01:59 My pants are the only thing that set me apart from the animals in the field. Please don't take my clothing. They're my badge of honor.
00:02:07 Okay, anyway, we're here at Procrastinate's podcast, and we're talking about some shit.
00:02:15 Okay, so we got a topic to Justin from a while ago. Oh, and DeVoo too. Of course. DeVoo encompasses the rest of us.
00:02:22 The furtive DeVoo.
00:02:24 So easily forgotten.
00:02:28 That's actually hilarious.
00:02:30 Except I made that same fucking joke about myself last week, and no one left any of us.
00:02:34 It wasn't hilarious when it was about Ben, because Ben's not cool.
00:02:39 No, that was a lie.
00:02:41 It was harsh, harsh justice.
00:02:44 Okay, we got a suggestion here for a topic from our buddy. It's Mun Keh at Mun Keh Away, who I think has asked a question before.
00:02:51 Is that my secret evil twin brother?
00:02:54 Probably, probably. But here's what they got to say. It's not Mum Keh Jones, it's Mun Keh Away.
00:03:01 He says, are there any art mediums you think are crap? I, for instance, share Digi's views of disliking visual novels.
00:03:10 So this guy's asking a question about the inherent worthiness of different artistic mediums, basically.
00:03:16 And a couple of us had been discussing this topic amongst themselves already, so this was a very apropos of a suggestion.
00:03:24 So Ben and Mun Chee, I believe. You got things to say about this, right?
00:03:28 Well, kinda. Kinda.
00:03:30 Like, okay, if by medium you mean like film, the pros, then I would say no. Probably not.
00:03:39 Well, I would say yes. However, continue Ben.
00:03:42 I was gonna say, but there are, I think there are genres that are inherently worthless.
00:03:48 Okay.
00:03:49 Yeah.
00:03:50 Well, this guy's talking about like visual novels, so I think we can define it however we want, it doesn't matter.
00:03:55 We'll run the entire game, but we'll go medium or genre.
00:03:57 We'll go fucking art itself being worthless, which is nice.
00:04:00 I'm just saying.
00:04:01 I'm gonna jump right into this and say that I think any medium or genre can be good, but not necessarily any...
00:04:07 Yeah.
00:04:08 Like, there may not be a good one in that genre yet, so they are using that.
00:04:13 I think anything can be good, but I think that being good, I think that like a porn, for example, that is good
00:04:20 is just inherently worthless than like a real book that is good, or a real movie that is good.
00:04:26 There are definitely tiers of goodness, depending like a sign to each class or medium.
00:04:32 Well, hang on.
00:04:33 Yeah, it's interesting.
00:04:34 And you will not go above that stat.
00:04:35 What if there's a book and there's like six in it at some point?
00:04:42 Yeah.
00:04:43 Well, it's not primary purpose is to be porn then.
00:04:46 What is it?
00:04:47 There's this really great anime called Kite, I think, and it's by some director who's really famous, who I forget.
00:04:53 And it's beautifully animated, and he's got a couple things like...
00:04:58 Nezo Forte is another one that's like that, that has some of like just the best hentai fat material in the game.
00:05:05 And yet, it's just in the context of this other story where there's just like...
00:05:09 It's like a detective sort of story where there's, you know, spies and it's adventure.
00:05:12 And yet, there's just these incredibly detailed sex scenes that are...
00:05:16 They're just super fappable.
00:05:18 They're just incredibly fappable.
00:05:19 And they're just in the context of this bigger piece of art.
00:05:22 So I don't even know...
00:05:23 It feels kind of separate.
00:05:25 It's almost like in Fate Stay Night, like the sex scenes feel very like removable from the story.
00:05:30 In the same way, these scenes...
00:05:32 Like, it's funny because most of them are just like dream sequences, at least in Mezo Forte.
00:05:36 So they're like completely removable.
00:05:39 But in Kite, the other one, they are actually kind of a characterization of this woman who like...
00:05:45 She's like a secret agent spy lady, and she is, you know, being controlled by this like evil policeman.
00:05:50 And you know, he has sex with her.
00:05:52 I feel like we're getting a little off topic here.
00:05:55 What exactly is it to you, Ben, about porn that makes it not valid?
00:06:02 It's not that it's not valid at all.
00:06:05 It's just less valid.
00:06:07 Because it all falls back on the same fucking...
00:06:11 It all amounts to the same thing in the end.
00:06:13 It all comes down to the same exact emotional response being evoked in it basically the same way again and again.
00:06:19 And it's cheap and it's tawdry, and nobody learns anything.
00:06:23 But if you, in theory, if you want to make like an artistic porn and try to evoke like other emotions, why can't you?
00:06:32 And also, I disagree.
00:06:34 It all comes down to the same feeling.
00:06:36 Like, sometimes I feel it more in my ass sometimes based on the context of the porn.
00:06:42 That's gross.
00:06:44 You feel it in your ass when you're watching the porn.
00:06:47 The idea of porn is to usually get your rocks off.
00:06:51 And if it's distraised from that, then it's not really porn.
00:06:54 Yeah, if you take a porn and you fucking just...
00:06:56 Well, that's like a no-true Scotsman for artistic mediums.
00:06:59 Yeah, you know, I guess it is.
00:07:03 And yet, if you take, I don't know, fucking, I don't know, porn of the week number 77
00:07:11 and you slap fucking Catcher in the Rye in the middle of it.
00:07:14 Like, have you made, have you then created a thoughtful and engaging work of pornography?
00:07:20 I would say no.
00:07:22 So you're saying that what you don't like about pornography is that it's just, you know, it doesn't matter how it gets there.
00:07:29 If it gives you an erection, then it's done its job and that's what it means to be a porn.
00:07:33 Yes.
00:07:35 Well, it just so happens.
00:07:37 That in itself is not artistic.
00:07:39 In order to be artistic, but to have something else would change it from porn into something that is not porn.
00:07:44 Look, that's an important question because the question here is, are there art mediums you think are crap?
00:07:50 If porn serves one, if it is a tool with which to get off as opposed to learn anything, then it's just not art.
00:07:57 It's not art if all you're getting from it is this one function.
00:08:00 It's very simple, please.
00:08:02 There is an artistic quest in making something that you can enjoy and also fab to at the same time.
00:08:09 I agree.
00:08:11 Why did my game keep going up?
00:08:13 I don't know.
00:08:15 It is art and there is artistry involved in it and I have read porn that has impressed me artistically
00:08:22 and yet I just don't think that it can ever exist and be worthy on the same fucking level as, you know, other stuff.
00:08:30 I'll tell you why.
00:08:32 It just so happens that there is a porn that was specifically made to confront this theme of whether or not porn should be considered art
00:08:40 or should be discussed in artistic circles and it's a comic called Lost Girls by Alan Moore, the creator of Watchmen.
00:08:47 And then the premise of the story is that all these public domain characters, Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz,
00:08:54 Alice from Alice in Wonderland and Wendy from Peter Pan, is during that era of like World War One,
00:08:59 they meet up together in a hostel somewhere in Europe and they get to talking and they talk about their sexual awakenings
00:09:04 and the whole story is about, you know, the stories of these characters retold through the lens of pornography of them
00:09:11 finding out about their sexuality and getting fucked and sucking cock and it's these underage girls sucking cock
00:09:16 and that's the porn aspect and it's hot and sexy.
00:09:18 But the whole reason that it was written is because Alan Moore felt like sex is underrepresented in literature
00:09:27 and he felt like it should be...
00:09:29 Because sex is...
00:09:31 What is like...
00:09:33 Even if it's just there to come, what's invalid about that?
00:09:35 Like coming is the most important part of human existence.
00:09:38 It's just as human as any other emotion.
00:09:40 You know, I kind of agree and like I think that like a work of fiction or like a work of prose or literature
00:09:47 can have like explicit sex in it and be good.
00:09:51 I don't think that makes it porn.
00:09:53 But it is porn.
00:09:55 Jack off to run and it's cool.
00:09:57 If the purpose of it is to make you jack off...
00:10:00 The purpose of it was to have sex in it.
00:10:02 Listen, if the purpose of that, of Lost Girls...
00:10:05 I've heard about Lost Girls, I haven't read it.
00:10:07 If the purpose of it is to get you off, then it's porn.
00:10:09 If the purpose of it is to confront themes of is porn art and it's not porn, it's art.
00:10:13 Why can't the purpose be both?
00:10:15 I guess...
00:10:17 I guess it can be both.
00:10:19 I think it's just how you're defining porn.
00:10:22 I have a question for Ben.
00:10:24 Is part of this resentment towards porn part of...
00:10:27 Is it your virgin rage?
00:10:29 Well, no.
00:10:31 Maybe.
00:10:33 No, is it part of like your disdain for artists who just make loads of money by just appealing to the lowest common denominator
00:10:41 slacking tits and making the tits bigger and then they get millions of pounds?
00:10:45 Is that the thing?
00:10:47 Yes!
00:10:49 Yes, that makes it mad and I think it's wrong and a sin.
00:10:51 Making something that I find hot enough to want to download is like...
00:10:55 Everyone should be in jail.
00:10:57 Everyone should be in jail and in hell.
00:10:59 Everyone should go to jail and then be put into hell jail.
00:11:02 You know, making something that I find hot enough to actually want to download is like always an exciting thing.
00:11:09 Like, wow, this is a thing that really appeals to my interests and aesthetic sensibilities so much that I'm going to revisit it.
00:11:15 And it's like they have so many specific tastes and interests that are like so underrepresented
00:11:21 and I find that finding people who actually make that product to be really exciting
00:11:27 just as much as someone making a video game that does what I want a video game to be.
00:11:31 I don't even disagree with any of that.
00:11:35 But it doesn't change how I feel.
00:11:37 What about for example...
00:11:39 For example, Playboy has always made it a sticking point of having tasteful nudity
00:11:46 as opposed to porn, like hardcore pornography, which is so prevalent.
00:11:50 Like, Playboy always talks itself up as a little bit artistic
00:11:55 and it kind of is.
00:11:57 I don't believe anyone has jacked off to a Playboy since the internet was invented.
00:12:00 It's the most unarousing, like, tame.
00:12:02 It's basically like looking at a girl's ankle at this point.
00:12:05 But like you still...
00:12:06 You can rip out pages from a Playboy and you can plaster them all over your wall.
00:12:12 I have a wall of beautiful naked women.
00:12:14 What's wrong with that?
00:12:15 It's tastefully nude photography and it's artistic because I say it is.
00:12:20 Well, this really all hinges on the definition of art.
00:12:24 What purpose does art serve and does porn meet the qualification?
00:12:28 Enough!
00:12:29 I've held my tongue for too long.
00:12:32 Welcome back to Listen Buddy Episode 3!
00:12:35 Sex Redux with your host, Munchy wears tiny hats.
00:12:40 As you all know, I hate sex with the passion.
00:12:44 And you will learn soon enough, sex is gross and I hate it with all my bean.
00:12:52 That's why I hate porn because it makes me think about sex.
00:12:55 I hate it so much and you don't even know.
00:13:00 Are you just being selfish and short-sighted, Munchy?
00:13:07 Because other people might enjoy porn.
00:13:09 No, I hate sex.
00:13:10 No one can like sex because it looks gross and it feels gross.
00:13:17 It's not even good.
00:13:18 It doesn't have any artistic merit and it's not cool.
00:13:22 I don't think people are cool who have sex.
00:13:25 Anyone who's ever had sex isn't cool.
00:13:27 Every time I go down in a woman and I get over zealous and I get way too toothy,
00:13:31 she goes, I hate sex with all my bean.
00:13:34 That's disgusting.
00:13:36 Overall, I'm sort of on the same wavelength as Ben is.
00:13:41 In general, with thinking of certain mediums as superior to others.
00:13:44 The whole everything is art and it's all subjectivity and stuff.
00:13:51 That is really fascinating and really inspiring when you're 15 learning about art and shit.
00:13:58 By now, I'm totally bored of all that subjectivity.
00:14:03 Everything is relative stuff.
00:14:05 At this point, I just have to come out and think that video games and animation
00:14:09 are two mediums that are cut above the rest.
00:14:12 And sequential art is a cut above the rest.
00:14:15 When Munchy is talking about how he's planning on making a comic or something,
00:14:19 I'm like, yeah, when you make a comic,
00:14:21 you will have produced a work that is of significantly more value
00:14:24 than any individual set of drawings that you could make.
00:14:27 And like me myself, I'm working on learning how to make video games
00:14:31 because I think video games as just the most powerful medium in existence.
00:14:35 Why would I not want to do that?
00:14:37 Why would I be stuck just making YouTube videos?
00:14:39 I agree, kind of.
00:14:41 Well, I don't agree with all of your categorizations,
00:14:43 but I do believe that there should be a hierarchy.
00:14:46 And you know what?
00:14:48 I honestly think that sequential art is at the top
00:14:52 and then animation is below it
00:14:54 and then video games are way below that.
00:14:57 What a surprise.
00:14:59 The comic boy thinks that comics are the only thing there.
00:15:02 Yeah, I know it's obvious.
00:15:04 Wait, no, no, no, pros.
00:15:06 Pros is better than video games, but below animation.
00:15:08 This is the stupidest shit I've ever heard.
00:15:11 I don't know.
00:15:13 We should get too much into the hierarchy
00:15:15 because I have a very well-defined tier list that I will bring up.
00:15:17 Well, hang on. What was Hippo saying?
00:15:19 Well, I mean, if we're going to just say,
00:15:21 well, I like this one more than that one
00:15:23 and then just have a list and then we're all going to disagree.
00:15:25 I mean, what's that going to do?
00:15:27 Yeah, that's bullshit.
00:15:29 It's going to be fun and we're going to argue about it.
00:15:31 We're going to yell, we're going to scream,
00:15:33 we're going to cry about it for an hour and a half.
00:15:35 No, are we done?
00:15:37 Are we done with porn?
00:15:39 Because I wanted to talk about porn.
00:15:41 I like really, really cool castles.
00:15:43 I like architecture.
00:15:45 I like medieval architecture.
00:15:47 That's my favorite art form.
00:15:49 Castles are way cooler than Homestuck.
00:15:51 Architecture is the lowest.
00:15:53 Castles are fucking gay. They're overused.
00:15:55 They aren't even cool.
00:15:57 They're always gray and dusty.
00:15:59 That's why I hate Dark Souls.
00:16:01 Architecture is the best man and utilitarian.
00:16:03 Yeah, that's the thing.
00:16:05 Dark Souls is only one step above analysis.
00:16:07 Really, architecture is just pornography for manual labor.
00:16:09 Here's the fucking...
00:16:11 There we go.
00:16:13 Animation, video games, movies, comics.
00:16:15 Munchy, calm the fuck down from it.
00:16:17 Let Hippo finish this goddamn thought.
00:16:19 The only reason Dark Souls is good is because it evokes
00:16:21 imagery of castles and medieval weaponry
00:16:23 and I really like all those things.
00:16:25 So people who make physical, real things,
00:16:27 3D sculptures, sculptures, architecture,
00:16:29 that's the best, that's the coolest stuff.
00:16:31 Physical objects are the worst.
00:16:33 Physical objects are the worst.
00:16:35 Do you ever just go on the internet
00:16:37 and shut the fuck up
00:16:39 and never speak to me ever again?
00:16:41 There's no internet.
00:16:43 Physical objects are inherently inferior
00:16:45 to digital and intellectual.
00:16:47 This infuriates me about
00:16:49 fucking art fags.
00:16:51 You're always thinking about if I just draw all these great pictures
00:16:53 think about all the great things I'll be able to do.
00:16:55 No, don't you understand that the entire purpose of art
00:16:57 is to make real life better
00:16:59 to improve our actual tangible lives?
00:17:01 That's the whole point.
00:17:03 The purpose of art is to be itself
00:17:05 and be cool.
00:17:07 We're gonna run up against a wall.
00:17:09 We're gonna reach the end of that journey one day
00:17:11 and then we're gonna say,
00:17:13 well, let's make some more pictures.
00:17:15 I don't give a fuck about pictures anymore.
00:17:17 We're gonna reach the end of the journey.
00:17:19 We're gonna hit, we're gonna be Starfleet
00:17:21 and then everyone's gonna be like, there's nothing left to do.
00:17:23 There's nothing left.
00:17:25 There's no point.
00:17:27 So life, humanity is doomed.
00:17:29 There's no point to anything.
00:17:31 Art is meaningless.
00:17:33 We're gonna get to the end.
00:17:35 We're gonna be Starfleet.
00:17:37 There's gonna be nothing left to do except fucking art
00:17:39 and it's just gonna exist for its own sake
00:17:41 because there's gonna be no other purpose
00:17:43 that it needs to fulfill.
00:17:45 I like standing in a place
00:17:47 that's really cool.
00:17:49 Looking at a mountain range is cool to be there
00:17:51 but it's not cool to look at a picture of.
00:17:53 It's cool because you know how cool it is to be
00:17:55 looking at a mountain range in real life.
00:17:57 Feeling that wind on your face.
00:17:59 Art replicates life, right?
00:18:01 Art is just derivative.
00:18:03 Art is all not real.
00:18:05 Everything that's real is cool.
00:18:07 I like going outside, I like looking at mountains,
00:18:09 I like seeing bricks, I like looking at rocks.
00:18:11 Literally nothing that is real is cool.
00:18:13 Nope.
00:18:15 I love everything that's real.
00:18:17 Never before in the history of the PCP
00:18:19 have I felt more like I'm just in a room
00:18:21 with insane people yelling at me.
00:18:23 Everything that's being said by everyone
00:18:25 is completely insane.
00:18:27 Like you yourself consider the mediums
00:18:29 YouTube and critique to be inferior
00:18:31 to almost all the other ones
00:18:33 and you dislike having to work within those mediums.
00:18:35 You make the same value judgements.
00:18:37 Yeah, obviously
00:18:39 it's all relative
00:18:41 there's no medium better than the other
00:18:43 but on a day by day basis
00:18:45 everyone has these preferences.
00:18:47 I hate YouTube because everyone on it sucks.
00:18:49 It doesn't mean I don't think it can be great.
00:18:51 YouTube can be just as great as any other medium.
00:18:53 Every medium has potential to be
00:18:55 astounding.
00:18:57 The medium of web video
00:18:59 is just as good as any other medium
00:19:01 but the format of
00:19:03 for example
00:19:05 video game analysis
00:19:07 or anime analysis
00:19:09 or any form of video criticism
00:19:11 is inherently low and piss porn.
00:19:13 I believe that criticism is not art
00:19:15 and should never be considered art.
00:19:17 Of course.
00:19:19 This is why I didn't give a fuck
00:19:21 about the whole discussion of porn really
00:19:23 because
00:19:26 is like a bullshit
00:19:28 genre of film
00:19:30 that we arbitrarily have decided
00:19:32 what defines a porn
00:19:34 and as we just saw with our whole argument
00:19:36 people value those things differently
00:19:38 and our definition can change
00:19:40 but none of that matters
00:19:42 because the point is
00:19:44 it's communicating things
00:19:46 and it's either going to do that or not
00:19:48 and then each of those ideas can be weighed for their value
00:19:50 or if they don't fucking accomplish anything
00:19:52 then obviously it's not worth having it
00:19:54 saying that like
00:19:56 French 19th century film
00:19:58 about the Alps
00:20:00 are like
00:20:02 that's my favorite genre
00:20:04 that's the best art form right there
00:20:06 that's equally arbitrary to me
00:20:08 is saying porn is all
00:20:10 whatever
00:20:12 but we can fucking define
00:20:14 we can define what porn is
00:20:16 even though the lines can be blurred
00:20:18 we can say porn is art
00:20:20 whose purpose is to get you off
00:20:22 and like we can take that
00:20:24 and go from there
00:20:26 and let me talk for a second
00:20:28 you know how like movies
00:20:30 are like they do like shit
00:20:32 and you're like happy about it
00:20:34 and you're also sad sometimes
00:20:36 they can make you feel different emotions
00:20:38 porn only makes you feel one emotion
00:20:40 and if it doesn't then it's not porn
00:20:42 I've decided
00:20:44 you know what
00:20:46 I don't know
00:20:48 I feel like there's a lost art to porn
00:20:50 I feel like there are things
00:20:52 I feel like what I value in a porn
00:20:54 is a rare is rare
00:20:56 and might actually be art
00:20:58 is it blacks?
00:21:00 no
00:21:02 I just go to black.com dude
00:21:04 I think that like the ultimate porn
00:21:06 would probably involve
00:21:08 some like deeply personal
00:21:10 emotional arc
00:21:12 that led you through all these characters
00:21:14 like innermost feelings and like culminated
00:21:16 yeah but Ben
00:21:18 if they made that you would just say
00:21:20 well that's not porn then
00:21:22 you're right
00:21:24 I think the ultimate porn
00:21:26 is the one that most speedily and most efficiently
00:21:28 gets you to orgasm as quickly as possible
00:21:30 that would be the ultimate porn
00:21:32 and whatever that requires
00:21:34 it's cheaper to have any merit cause it's gay
00:21:38 if there was porn
00:21:40 that made me like literally fall in love with people
00:21:42 and then like
00:21:44 just made me like cry tears of joy
00:21:46 seeing them have sex with each other
00:21:48 I would be like this porn is art
00:21:50 even the greatest film ever made
00:21:52 has never achieved that
00:21:54 there are some that aspire to that
00:21:56 but dude even the greatest drama
00:21:58 that's not what porn is at its core
00:22:00 even the greatest film
00:22:02 has never achieved that for anyone ever
00:22:04 so how could like porn
00:22:06 a sub genre
00:22:08 a small niche thing within all the film
00:22:10 possibly accomplish that
00:22:12 like I think you're setting your expectations way too high
00:22:14 through the media
00:22:16 my point is what it aspires to
00:22:18 most porn at its core
00:22:20 doesn't try to do that
00:22:22 porn at its core really just tries to get you off
00:22:24 every single artistic medium
00:22:26 or format
00:22:28 is all just a set of guidelines and boundaries
00:22:30 of what we decide that that format can be
00:22:32 and sooner or later by the very nature of it
00:22:34 someone in that little
00:22:36 in that box of guidelines
00:22:38 is going to make something that pushes on those boundaries
00:22:40 and possibly even breaks them out
00:22:42 so you can't just sit there
00:22:44 and as soon as something breaks those boundaries
00:22:46 say that it's not that thing anymore
00:22:48 if it started as that thing and pushed on those boundaries
00:22:50 then that makes it totally
00:22:52 just as valid as anything outside those boundaries
00:22:54 you fucking clods
00:22:56 it can still be valid without being
00:22:58 the thing
00:23:00 it's like a similar thing
00:23:02 but it's not quite the thing
00:23:04 but it's so easy to say that I don't think that this medium
00:23:06 is as valid as that medium
00:23:08 but then when this medium impresses you
00:23:10 that's not this medium anymore
00:23:12 that's completely recocculus and cockamamie
00:23:14 I have a very narrow definition of porn
00:23:16 any sex ever
00:23:18 so that can be applied to any movie or comic
00:23:20 and I'll always be upset
00:23:22 and when they leave those peer views
00:23:24 then I'm happy about it
00:23:26 and then it's fine
00:23:28 Game of Thrones literally shows you goose dicks
00:23:30 that's porn
00:23:32 yeah
00:23:34 I'm just saying you see
00:23:36 no one hates a sex as much as me
00:23:38 they get known throughout the land
00:23:40 I am the ultimate anti-sex crusader
00:23:42 does that make you redpilled
00:23:44 or bluepilled
00:23:46 have we discussed before?
00:23:48 I'm a green pill
00:23:50 Munchy is the leader
00:23:52 ever since Count Graduon was defeated
00:23:54 Munchy is the new leader
00:23:56 of the private villa of corrupted citizens
00:23:58 preventing Christian West and Chandler from getting laid
00:24:00 of course
00:24:02 I've expanded the group's ambitions
00:24:04 to not only Christian West and Chandler
00:24:07 but the entire universe
00:24:09 you're doing God's work
00:24:11 I really feel like I can't relate to this whole
00:24:13 talking about the
00:24:15 artistic endeavors of porn
00:24:17 because most porn is about sex
00:24:19 and sex is very normal
00:24:21 it happens a lot
00:24:23 so it's really easy to justify a context for it
00:24:25 I seek out porn where not normal things happen
00:24:27 so there's a lot of questions about how to make that
00:24:29 narratively occur
00:24:31 and so I get really excited with
00:24:33 this is an incredible context
00:24:35 to make this, that and that
00:24:37 happen all in the same narrative
00:24:39 god damn
00:24:41 I completely get where you're coming from
00:24:43 but does that have to occur in porn then?
00:24:45 is that related to the act of having sex?
00:24:47 it sounds like
00:24:49 let me backpedal
00:24:51 and be like okay
00:24:53 there have been pornographic stories
00:24:55 and materials that have actually really impacted me
00:24:57 and left me with a lasting impression
00:24:59 and been like wow that was art
00:25:01 but
00:25:03 there have been way more
00:25:05 that has just been hot
00:25:07 and has gotten me off
00:25:09 and what I would consider
00:25:11 good porn
00:25:13 and yet I don't think it's art
00:25:15 so it's like porn was just
00:25:17 an extra layer that may as well
00:25:19 didn't have to be there for that story to be told
00:25:21 it was just there
00:25:23 exactly
00:25:25 there have been some that have done both
00:25:27 it has happened
00:25:29 would it be smarter of us to define porn
00:25:31 to use what the word porn
00:25:33 as sort of an attachment
00:25:35 to a piece of artwork that can exist independently
00:25:37 or with this extra label of porn
00:25:39 it's obviously not a medium
00:25:41 no I don't think so
00:25:43 we'll see where that's what we're arguing about here
00:25:45 it's much more genre
00:25:47 I think it's a porn if it's purpose is to get you off
00:25:49 it can be anything
00:25:51 it can even be actual sex
00:25:53 and I will consider it porn
00:25:55 like medium I believe used to mean literally
00:25:57 are you using a paintbrush or a chisel
00:25:59 so obviously porn is not a medium
00:26:01 real life for example
00:26:03 is a totally crass
00:26:05 and commercial and artistically
00:26:07 worthless work of pornography
00:26:09 of course
00:26:11 you guys are overcomplicating it
00:26:13 it just has sex therefore it's shit
00:26:15 well none of us agree with you on that
00:26:17 you're all just weird puritans
00:26:19 I can't believe I've been friends with you this long
00:26:23 now I mean
00:26:25 we're arguing about artistic merit
00:26:27 what is the
00:26:29 I don't even know
00:26:31 I don't know what art even means
00:26:33 what has more artistic merit than fucking
00:26:35 in life nothing
00:26:37 define art as you say it
00:26:39 artistic merit
00:26:41 what does that mean
00:26:43 art is stuff that's good and I like
00:26:45 sex
00:26:47 anyone if you want
00:26:49 if you have something that you want to create
00:26:51 and then you create it then you have made art
00:26:53 and if that art
00:26:55 if I watch that art
00:26:57 and I go wowee
00:26:59 you've made great art and there you go
00:27:01 holy shit Jesse thank you
00:27:03 that was a definition I've always come with
00:27:05 by that definition are fruit roll-ups also art
00:27:07 because they make me say wowee
00:27:09 made of fucking like melted shoe bottoms
00:27:11 I know but I love that
00:27:13 that's my favorite thing
00:27:15 if two people come together to create human beings
00:27:17 is that art
00:27:19 that's building art
00:27:21 I would say yes
00:27:23 the fact of raising a child could be interpreted
00:27:25 raising a child
00:27:27 we're getting off top
00:27:29 we're not supposed to be talking about what is art
00:27:31 because that's a nebulous fucking means nothing
00:27:33 we're talking about like the hierarchy
00:27:35 if one exists
00:27:37 let's talk about other things
00:27:39 like we've touched upon
00:27:41 the medium of web video
00:27:43 and whether it's valuable
00:27:45 and we've touched upon
00:27:47 oh god what was that other thing
00:27:49 there were some other things that was brought up
00:27:51 I don't know
00:27:53 I guess I've been arguing
00:27:55 analysis and critique
00:27:57 it is analysis and critique art
00:27:59 yes it is
00:28:01 it's definitely art
00:28:03 you know what it's exactly like porn
00:28:05 you can have an analysis
00:28:07 or a critique
00:28:09 that has elements
00:28:11 that are artistically valid and valuable
00:28:13 but the critique itself is not art
00:28:15 well okay I guess if critique
00:28:17 literally just means placing judgment on a thing
00:28:19 like if you do it with no creativity
00:28:21 whatsoever
00:28:23 then it's not artistic
00:28:25 but any review is going to be artistic
00:28:27 on some level so that's why it's called a medium
00:28:29 well any pornography is artistic
00:28:31 on some level you kind of like where do you put the camera
00:28:33 what music do you put over it etc
00:28:35 there's this general sense of
00:28:37 if a medium is largely bullshit
00:28:39 then it's lower on the hierarchy
00:28:41 because like porn
00:28:43 a lot of porn is shit a lot of reviews
00:28:45 are complete garbage
00:28:47 that are good so like the medium itself
00:28:49 is fine all the mediums are fine
00:28:51 no it's not what I'm saying
00:28:53 I think that it's not about the
00:28:55 it's not just that most of it is bad
00:28:57 I think that it is inherently less valuable
00:28:59 yeah I agree
00:29:01 when I watch a really great anime
00:29:03 porn and criticism this is true of both of these things
00:29:05 okay you know what we should frame this
00:29:07 the idea of them isn't good
00:29:09 I think we should frame this
00:29:11 I think it makes a lot more sense
00:29:13 we're going deep but it makes a lot of sense
00:29:15 to do it from the way that Ben was initially talking about it
00:29:17 like there are people out there
00:29:19 who make tons of money drawing porn
00:29:21 and then there are people who make
00:29:23 you know like much more
00:29:25 I just like there's much more
00:29:27 thought put into like your average
00:29:29 comic of you know X amount of like
00:29:31 they're just like a picture
00:29:33 of a porn that is drawn with great technical skill
00:29:35 like I drew a monster girl she has big tits and a big dick
00:29:37 give me a hundred thousand dollars
00:29:39 that person is rewarded more by society
00:29:41 in the form of they get more money
00:29:43 to make an impact of porn
00:29:45 as opposed to just porn itself
00:29:47 well that's the whole thing the artistic mediums
00:29:49 that we think are crap is the question
00:29:51 so it's about our perception of
00:29:53 I just think that
00:29:55 medium is
00:29:57 it's just a way of expressing yourself
00:29:59 and you have preferences
00:30:01 depending on who you are and what you like
00:30:03 here's what I think about
00:30:05 well here's what I think about
00:30:07 criticism
00:30:09 aside from any other like artistic
00:30:11 considerations or additions
00:30:13 to a work of criticism the criticism
00:30:15 itself derives
00:30:17 all of its value from an existing
00:30:19 work of art being criticized
00:30:21 therefore it can't
00:30:23 the criticism itself yes
00:30:25 therefore it can't ever be
00:30:27 as valuable as the work of art from which
00:30:29 it derives its value it has to
00:30:31 be inferior
00:30:33 listen Ben listen to this great example
00:30:35 right here I forget what but there was some
00:30:37 movie you'll probably know the name of this
00:30:39 there's some movie that was made
00:30:41 it was like a Hollywood movie it was a complete
00:30:43 bust everyone working on it got fucked over
00:30:45 and nobody liked it
00:30:47 maybe you've heard of it its name was Star Wars
00:30:49 there was a
00:30:51 there was a documentary made about
00:30:53 this film that I can't remember the name of
00:30:55 that is like
00:30:57 much more celebrated
00:30:59 of a piece of
00:31:01 of art that was about
00:31:03 the making of this film
00:31:05 that details like the crazy experiences
00:31:07 that were had by the people trying to make
00:31:09 it was a troll too
00:31:11 it's very similar to that I think it's a
00:31:13 different movie but it's
00:31:15 talking about the making of
00:31:17 it's like the artistic value
00:31:19 of this no no no
00:31:21 yeah that is right that is not
00:31:23 a criticism of the movie
00:31:25 it is in part that is one of the things
00:31:27 that's when it started out as
00:31:29 now we're talking about all the other stuff
00:31:31 that's ancillary to the actual criticism
00:31:33 here's a here's how I think
00:31:35 I can't add anything to a criticism
00:31:37 other than just the criticism of the piece
00:31:39 which is obviously not true
00:31:41 that's not true
00:31:43 specifically in the case of Sonic the Hedgehog
00:31:45 a series where
00:31:47 god damn it Tavu we're not talking about Sonic the Hedgehog
00:31:49 we're talking about this other example
00:31:51 about uh
00:31:53 you know
00:31:55 has resulted in lots and lots of amazing reviews
00:31:57 and analysis from which I derive
00:31:59 so much enjoyment and indeed
00:32:01 all of the criticism that that franchise has seen
00:32:03 it all comes from details present
00:32:05 in the games themselves
00:32:07 if you want to use a metaphor you could say it's like
00:32:09 um cooking raw ingredients
00:32:11 that have these like flavors
00:32:13 that are trapped inside of them that you couldn't just
00:32:15 eat right off the shrub
00:32:17 it wouldn't be able to get the enjoyment but when processed
00:32:19 correctly by a critique
00:32:21 it draws out those uh those ingredients
00:32:23 and that's
00:32:27 that's something that was in the original piece
00:32:29 similar stuff like
00:32:31 the huge uh analysis
00:32:33 of the enchanted series
00:32:35 is much more entertaining than playing any of the
00:32:37 uncharted games
00:32:39 at least the first one
00:32:41 and also the game grumps let's play of Sonic 06
00:32:43 is obviously much more entertaining
00:32:45 than playing the game
00:32:47 so derivative things can be better
00:32:49 than the original
00:32:51 I think there's something misguided
00:32:53 about trying to argue this on the basis of
00:32:55 you can make a good criticism
00:32:57 of a bad game
00:32:59 that doesn't really seem to be answering the question
00:33:01 I have solved this
00:33:03 dilemma about critique and criticism
00:33:05 and everyone needs to not say a single
00:33:07 goddamn word until I finish making this
00:33:09 point
00:33:11 we're all talking about critique and
00:33:13 criticism as though it has
00:33:15 lower value as art than other art
00:33:17 but the fact is critique and
00:33:19 criticism should not be considered art
00:33:21 and therefore it's worth
00:33:23 is irrelevant to this conversation and also
00:33:25 fucking
00:33:27 ugh
00:33:29 the way I see it
00:33:31 I agree that it's not art
00:33:33 you can't disagree
00:33:35 because the point is not finished being made
00:33:37 I thought you finished
00:33:39 rather than
00:33:41 seeing critique and criticism
00:33:43 as
00:33:45 artistic mediums we should see them
00:33:47 as what they are which is artistic
00:33:49 tools they are not art they are tools
00:33:51 to make art with
00:33:53 every work of art has some element of criticism
00:33:55 or critique or satire already in it
00:33:57 as part of its creation
00:33:59 so talking about criticism as though
00:34:01 it's a medium of art unto itself
00:34:03 is misguided and flawed and stupid because
00:34:05 critique and criticism
00:34:07 is essentially a paintbrush or a pencil
00:34:09 it's just another tool to make art with
00:34:11 okay yeah
00:34:13 okay with that
00:34:15 would you say that
00:34:17 wrestling isn't wrestling
00:34:19 that's a youtube video
00:34:21 that's a man making art
00:34:23 with the tool of critique
00:34:25 yeah so
00:34:27 would the medium be a film or a youtube video
00:34:29 or something what would you call that
00:34:31 any
00:34:33 great analysis video that you've seen
00:34:35 like a matthew matosis he's just making
00:34:37 he's making art
00:34:39 with the tool of critique
00:34:41 nice
00:34:43 if I make
00:34:45 if you make a parody of something
00:34:47 or a satire or something you're making
00:34:49 your own work of art with
00:34:51 your critique of another thing
00:34:53 I agree with this
00:34:55 so the art itself is the video
00:34:57 that's being made
00:34:59 the critique is just
00:35:01 something you're using to make the video
00:35:03 I agree with this but
00:35:05 and I guess the way to differentiate
00:35:07 videos from one another is to use genres
00:35:09 so analysis would also be
00:35:11 a genre of video
00:35:13 my point is I just don't think that it's relevant
00:35:15 or fair to
00:35:17 I mean I don't think the hierarchy idea is fair
00:35:19 in general but to put like critique
00:35:21 and criticism like at the bottom of the hierarchy
00:35:23 is not fair because it shouldn't be even
00:35:25 in the hierarchy at all it's a tool
00:35:27 well it's funny is that
00:35:29 to devils advocate this
00:35:31 as I said a little bit ago that
00:35:33 originally like medium meant
00:35:35 what tools you used
00:35:37 like the medium of a painting
00:35:39 versus a sculpture
00:35:41 so like you know
00:35:43 anyway I actually agree entirely
00:35:45 with your point based on the current definition
00:35:47 of medium but I just figure some people
00:35:49 are going to be pedantic about this
00:35:51 that's fair so it's like
00:35:53 saying that like if I am a
00:35:55 landscape painter
00:35:57 and I make the best landscape
00:35:59 paintings I can and you know people like them
00:36:01 or they don't that's one thing but then
00:36:03 if fucking Ben St
00:36:05 landscape painting critic
00:36:07 Waltz is by my booth
00:36:09 at the local art
00:36:11 landscape convention
00:36:13 yeah the landscape convention
00:36:15 is a youtuber who makes videos
00:36:17 in which he analyzes landscape paintings
00:36:19 that is like a whole different medium
00:36:21 that should obviously not be
00:36:23 directly compared to me
00:36:25 as a landscape painting creator
00:36:27 those are two very different types of art
00:36:29 they are very different
00:36:31 well yeah they're completely different
00:36:33 no they're yeah but they're not different
00:36:35 in the same way like a painting
00:36:37 and a work of prose are both
00:36:39 you know they're both aspiring to create
00:36:41 can you compare a sculpture to a video game
00:36:43 I think you can
00:36:45 I think you can
00:36:47 I think you can more than you can compare
00:36:49 a criticism to
00:36:51 a book
00:36:53 it's just gonna be hard it's just gonna be really
00:36:55 like like state your case that
00:36:57 like the Venus de Milo
00:36:59 is a better piece of art than
00:37:01 Undertale you know whatever
00:37:03 like you know you can you can
00:37:05 I think you can argue that
00:37:07 the thing that we just just you know
00:37:09 discussed is that critique is not
00:37:11 an art form it's the medium
00:37:13 in which you're explaining
00:37:15 your critique is the art
00:37:17 so if you're making a YouTube video
00:37:19 you can compare a YouTube video critiquing
00:37:21 something else because it's a video
00:37:23 it's a thing in itself it's part of a
00:37:25 right right well anyway obviously
00:37:27 and I think it would and I think it would
00:37:29 come up short because
00:37:31 what it amounts to
00:37:33 is criticism
00:37:35 which is not artistically
00:37:37 on the same fucking wavelength
00:37:39 it's a video which means it can have more
00:37:41 than criticism in it it can have visuals and stuff
00:37:43 and it's gonna be really good it's gonna be the best video
00:37:45 you've ever seen so like there's no
00:37:47 you're right you're right and therefore it's not the
00:37:49 criticism that you like or that you
00:37:51 this is why and going back
00:37:53 criticism itself that's the art
00:37:55 right and going back to it like
00:37:57 a porn as in
00:37:59 a film with you know
00:38:01 sex for the viewer's sexual
00:38:03 gratification can in fact be
00:38:05 the best art piece in it because that porn
00:38:07 element is one element of it
00:38:09 and therefore as we've just discussed
00:38:11 it can have other elements as well
00:38:13 that may elevate it may synchronize with the porn
00:38:15 elements I actually think that
00:38:17 I would say that the porn
00:38:19 part is art whereas the criticism isn't
00:38:21 like I think that I think that
00:38:23 I think that like the sex part is like it's
00:38:25 more it's more comparable to other art
00:38:27 criticism is we need to
00:38:29 to make sure we understand
00:38:31 the difference between a tool used
00:38:33 to create art
00:38:35 you know a medium of art
00:38:37 if everything is a tool
00:38:39 to use to make a video like
00:38:41 the camera, the lighting, the people
00:38:43 having sex
00:38:45 the size of the penis, is that a tool
00:38:47 in the porn
00:38:49 it is
00:38:51 if those all go into a video
00:38:53 are we
00:38:55 arguing what tools
00:38:57 are better than others or what
00:38:59 whether videos are better than music
00:39:01 or whatever
00:39:03 like the current definition of medium
00:39:05 is the delivery method like if you were
00:39:07 to print out all of the assembly
00:39:09 code for Super Mario World on the paper
00:39:11 it would no longer be a video game though
00:39:13 it would technically be the same work
00:39:15 made with the same tools plus a printer
00:39:17 I'm lost
00:39:19 well anyway the argument is over
00:39:21 because video games are the best medium
00:39:23 because they have all the other mediums
00:39:25 but also interactivity argument over
00:39:27 that's dumb there's no the best medium
00:39:29 totally disagree
00:39:31 I'm lucky of mediums where I very clearly
00:39:33 well define
00:39:35 it's time for me to bust out
00:39:37 my fucking fallacy
00:39:39 I'm gonna bust out the fallacy of
00:39:41 saying that Davoo is wrong because he agrees
00:39:43 with someone who is bad
00:39:45 you know who else thinks that same exact thing
00:39:47 fucking Phil Fish, Davoo
00:39:49 therefore you're wrong because I've
00:39:51 associated you with a bad person
00:39:53 guilty by association
00:39:55 I've done it, I've succeeded
00:39:57 every single time I've heard people talk
00:39:59 about these terrible Phil Fish quotes
00:40:01 I'm like this guy is hilarious, this guy kicks ass
00:40:03 yeah
00:40:05 Phil Fish literally says in Indie Game the movie
00:40:07 that video games are the ultimate medium
00:40:09 because it's all the other mediums plus interactivity
00:40:11 yeah
00:40:13 I mean it doesn't like some they have the same
00:40:15 stupid facial hair
00:40:17 me too
00:40:19 I don't agree with that sentiment logically
00:40:21 it just like
00:40:23 emotionally it makes perfect sense to me
00:40:25 because that's why I like video games the most
00:40:27 it's like you know when I
00:40:29 I don't agree because interactivity can come between
00:40:31 an artistic message
00:40:33 as easily as it can
00:40:35 things will come between things in porn too
00:40:37 some games can use the interactivity
00:40:39 to make it better, some games have
00:40:41 an interactivity because it's a game
00:40:43 which makes the experience worse than if you're just watching it
00:40:45 yeah
00:40:47 it's true
00:40:49 I disagree
00:40:51 I want someone to program
00:40:53 the godfather with cut scenes where
00:40:55 you push like quick time events to make the scene
00:40:57 continue
00:40:59 interactivity is another tool
00:41:01 you can't like mathematically say
00:41:03 that a medium is better than others
00:41:05 because it comprises elements
00:41:07 of those other mediums
00:41:09 the best work of art
00:41:11 in any medium
00:41:13 is better than all the mediocre works
00:41:15 of art in every other medium
00:41:17 yeah
00:41:19 I know
00:41:21 I know you're right Jesse I just don't want to
00:41:23 quit being mad
00:41:25 well okay we've been talking about this a lot
00:41:27 I think that's the theme of this entire episode actually
00:41:29 starting from the
00:41:31 topic
00:41:33 it's animation, video games, movies,
00:41:35 comics, lists
00:41:37 wait much you start over please
00:41:39 start from the top and then going down
00:41:41 animation, video games
00:41:43 movies, comics, music
00:41:45 books
00:41:47 and then I would put
00:41:49 our books even above
00:41:51 zero or they under the zero level
00:41:53 I would say they're
00:41:55 they do more damage than good
00:41:57 oh oh oh sculpture is below book
00:41:59 I'm going to go with
00:42:01 so is individual paintings and drawings
00:42:03 okay
00:42:05 video games, then animation
00:42:07 then sequential art, then live action
00:42:09 film, then music
00:42:11 then books actually probably put music
00:42:13 above live action film
00:42:15 and I sort of think of youtube videos
00:42:17 as sort of like it's own like zero
00:42:19 place it's like I don't care about it
00:42:21 as much as any of the others and yet I care
00:42:23 about it more than any of the others it's like it's own
00:42:25 dimension
00:42:27 okay cool well I don't actually want to hear everybody
00:42:29 I want to say mine I want to say that
00:42:31 sequential art and pros are at the top
00:42:33 I would say that I would say animation
00:42:35 is underneath both
00:42:37 pros why the fuck would you put animation
00:42:39 below comics how can you defend that
00:42:41 I have my reason because it's gay
00:42:43 music is at the very bottom
00:42:45 music is at the very bottom
00:42:47 yeah for some that I just feel that
00:42:49 I just feel that in my heart and so I'm going
00:42:51 to go with it uncritically
00:42:53 I would like to say that when I say sculpture
00:42:55 it's not just like things in museums
00:42:57 and whatever it's just like
00:42:59 the feeling of being in the presence of
00:43:01 something physical and real which no other
00:43:03 thing has
00:43:05 yeah Ben's talking about those 2D bullshit
00:43:07 that isn't even real
00:43:09 you know what
00:43:11 actually that's not sculpture and individual
00:43:13 paintings and drawings are the worst
00:43:15 yeah I agree with that
00:43:17 I just want to say that
00:43:19 I can't upload those to my soundcloud account
00:43:21 you know what true art
00:43:23 the highest form of art has an emotional
00:43:25 arc to it and a static
00:43:27 image I mean I guess it can
00:43:29 have an emotional arc to it but it usually
00:43:31 doesn't it doesn't lend
00:43:33 it doesn't lend itself to the having
00:43:35 of an emotional arc same with the sculpture
00:43:37 this whole conversation
00:43:39 music can have an emotional arc to it
00:43:41 and therefore it's better
00:43:43 this whole conversation is completely insane
00:43:45 there's no hierarchy
00:43:47 every artistic medium has the same
00:43:49 amount of prestige and value
00:43:51 which is no prestige and value
00:43:53 the mediums themselves have no goddamn value
00:43:55 the works of art within said mediums
00:43:57 are what have the goddamn value
00:43:59 this whole conversation is goofy
00:44:01 well the reason why I like to
00:44:03 hierarchy things like this is because it helps me
00:44:05 in making decisions as to what media
00:44:07 I want to consume and also create
00:44:09 and also promote it just makes it
00:44:11 like easy shorthand it makes it very
00:44:13 convenient for me I don't agree with that
00:44:15 because I don't actually want to consume
00:44:17 any works of art even in the mediums that I
00:44:19 purport to like so
00:44:21 well it's all fucking shit
00:44:23 there you go
00:44:25 good then you're a reasonable person
00:44:27 I just wanted to explain that I like
00:44:29 being in physically around stuff
00:44:31 rather than looking at a screen
00:44:33 that's just generally my preference
00:44:35 I think most of the art I consume
00:44:37 is manga
00:44:39 that's good that's high tier
00:44:41 that's high tier you're doing it right
00:44:43 hooray for me I'm glad I'm on your
00:44:45 that's around mid tier
00:44:47 you know what you know what it is you know what it is
00:44:49 you know why I put animation below sequential art
00:44:51 is because it commu
00:44:53 okay okay
00:44:55 you can communicate like
00:44:57 a little more through
00:44:59 animation you can communicate
00:45:01 stuff in a moving picture
00:45:03 than you can in a static one but not
00:45:05 enough more to justify
00:45:07 like the fucking like the amount
00:45:09 of extra work that it takes
00:45:11 oh so now it's an equation you have to do
00:45:13 of effort input versus what you're able to get
00:45:15 the work it takes to do something
00:45:17 and how much money it costs it doesn't matter to the art
00:45:19 whatsoever
00:45:21 okay that's true
00:45:23 fuck shit dammit
00:45:25 there goes your
00:45:27 I would say that like yeah animation
00:45:29 is like it has to like
00:45:31 it's sense of time has to be more realistic
00:45:33 which can be good but you know
00:45:35 when something is sequential art it can like
00:45:37 tell stories with a specific kind of
00:45:39 pace that doesn't have to make complete
00:45:41 considerations for the sense of time
00:45:43 digi actually has an old video about this
00:45:45 called the problem with adapting
00:45:47 shown in fight manga where it's like
00:45:49 the problem with pacing and so much anime
00:45:51 is that manga isn't written to like
00:45:53 make sense with time and that's a power
00:45:55 that sequential art has it can just sort of exist
00:45:57 in this nether realm of time
00:45:59 yeah that's an advantage I
00:46:01 acknowledge that that's true though I think you probably
00:46:03 could animate it
00:46:05 I don't know you have control
00:46:07 it wouldn't take too much to just make a brand new
00:46:09 medium by just changing a few of the rules
00:46:11 of any given thing that already exists
00:46:13 well like there's only so many senses
00:46:15 that you can appeal to at once
00:46:17 I mean we could add smellovision you know
00:46:19 suppositories
00:46:21 like animation and film
00:46:23 let's not smell them they all have like rules
00:46:25 they have like things they need money they need to be
00:46:27 on tv they need to be made for certain
00:46:29 things
00:46:31 and you can just take a medium
00:46:33 and fuck it up like that book that's like
00:46:35 all fucked up you know that one the house
00:46:37 leaves or whatever house leaves yep that's a
00:46:39 book that's not really a book
00:46:41 you just make it it's a book well guys
00:46:43 I know your point though
00:46:45 to I have actually
00:46:47 been lying this entire time
00:46:49 oh yes because
00:46:51 is that the kayfabe commander because
00:46:53 you there is
00:46:55 a specific medium of art
00:46:57 that I detest so much
00:46:59 that I view it as having inherently
00:47:01 less value than
00:47:03 any other artistic medium
00:47:05 is it and that medium
00:47:07 is slam poetry
00:47:09 yep yep yep
00:47:11 yep
00:47:13 now I've never
00:47:15 defined slam poetry I'll define it
00:47:17 for you and I'll clarify that I think
00:47:19 that poetry
00:47:21 itself is invaluable as art poetry
00:47:23 is
00:47:25 demonstrably valuable
00:47:27 but as a raps man I thought you would be
00:47:29 sort of in tune with your
00:47:31 poetic side slam poetry is not rap
00:47:33 slam poetry is a perversion of poetry
00:47:35 and rap it's like you took the worst aspects
00:47:37 of rap and poetry and combined them
00:47:39 into one and the one
00:47:41 depressing stew with a disgusting
00:47:43 the toxic brew that turns you
00:47:45 into a that video
00:47:47 I hate religion but I
00:47:49 love Jesus that's I'm gonna get to that
00:47:51 yeah that's what slam poetry
00:47:53 is poetry
00:47:55 which is fine which is which is beautiful
00:47:57 it's art there's plenty of room to
00:47:59 you can make a man cry with a good poem
00:48:01 someone writes a poem
00:48:03 but that's not good enough for them
00:48:05 they have to they have to get up
00:48:07 and they have to speak this poem
00:48:09 with all the all the bad acting power
00:48:11 they can possibly muster to try to
00:48:13 to try to force an emotion into you
00:48:15 by way of their voice yelling
00:48:17 it at you and they put
00:48:19 they put it on YouTube they put some cheesy
00:48:21 like some public domain music behind
00:48:23 to make it seem more inspirational
00:48:25 and they just recite their bad poetry
00:48:27 but they recite it in this arrogant
00:48:29 aggressive pseudo-intellectual
00:48:31 pompous pretentious way
00:48:33 that's just this is my poetry
00:48:35 and you will love my poetry
00:48:37 and you have to feel something because
00:48:39 I'm smart there's this one motherfucker on
00:48:41 YouTube who he does
00:48:43 this slam poetry shit about like
00:48:45 Christianity and God and shit
00:48:47 he's hugely popular he's got like
00:48:49 you know he's on Facebook all the time
00:48:51 by everyone's crappy religious relatives
00:48:53 every day on Facebook
00:48:55 it's just this like this
00:48:57 this dweeby fucking this douchey looking
00:48:59 motherfucker with like a buzz cut
00:49:01 he looks like fucking the main
00:49:03 character from the Assassin's Creed games
00:49:05 not any of the assassins I mean the guy who's sitting
00:49:07 in the fucking the the animus that fucking
00:49:09 loser he looks like that guy
00:49:11 and he stands in front of like some
00:49:13 government building
00:49:15 in like a hoodie with like the color saturation
00:49:17 way down so it looks like it's like a gray
00:49:19 a sad day
00:49:21 and he's just brightening your life with this
00:49:23 these words of wisdom and he stands there
00:49:25 and he starts talking about Jesus people don't
00:49:27 believe in God anymore
00:49:29 well I don't believe in people who don't
00:49:31 believe in God because
00:49:33 Jesus came to take my sins
00:49:35 and make me and it's like shut up
00:49:37 you're ruining poetry you're ruining
00:49:39 rap you're ruining human discourse you're even
00:49:41 fucking ruining religion you stupid
00:49:43 smug pretentious motherfucker I hope
00:49:45 you get crucified you faggot
00:49:47 I I hate to be
00:49:49 nitpicky but is this
00:49:51 it sounds a little bit like it's criticizing
00:49:53 you know like I don't know like
00:49:55 like new metal
00:49:57 for being like a shitty version of a
00:49:59 particular genre of music
00:50:01 is that wrong is that wrong
00:50:03 hey hey I don't know about slam
00:50:05 poetry on YouTube I don't know about that but I will
00:50:07 say that I have been severely annoyed by poetry
00:50:09 that I have heard like at parties
00:50:11 that I have been to where like someone
00:50:13 there is a poet and like they've like
00:50:15 read their poetry out in a fucking
00:50:17 thing yeah I have been severely
00:50:19 annoyed by the way in which
00:50:21 all so much poetry that people
00:50:23 write and that read and that they take so much
00:50:25 pride in just sounds like it was written
00:50:27 for the purpose of sounding like poetry
00:50:29 and it's all delivered in this very
00:50:31 like this very like quote-unquote
00:50:33 poetic way yeah and it's just like a
00:50:35 series of lofty and evocative
00:50:37 images like you know with some kind of emotional
00:50:39 just add water
00:50:41 poetic cadence that's like
00:50:43 it's like it's like it's like yeah
00:50:45 it's yeah it's like they're doing it
00:50:47 just because they think it's supposed to be
00:50:49 that way it's like it's like bag serial
00:50:51 depth yeah can there be
00:50:53 no good slam poet though
00:50:55 I listen to a poet I listen to
00:50:57 someone reading their poetry like that and I think
00:50:59 doesn't this fucker know that
00:51:01 art is meant to engage
00:51:03 the audience and like I'm sitting
00:51:05 here being bored out of my mind by this
00:51:07 cookie cutter bullshit you've written and I
00:51:09 feel like no effort has been made to engage
00:51:11 me the audience which is what it's supposed
00:51:13 to do and it's never even like clever like it's
00:51:15 never cleverly put together there's no clever
00:51:17 like structure or rhythm or wordplay
00:51:19 to it it has it's always right and it's not
00:51:21 even like clever like topics it's always like
00:51:23 my dad beat me or I'm a feminist and here's
00:51:25 why or I love Jesus and here's
00:51:27 why there's there's no attempt at just
00:51:29 the corny is shaken up and like surprise
00:51:31 the corny's mother fuckers there's no surprise to it
00:51:33 you know what I hate it there has to be
00:51:35 there has to be something in there that will like
00:51:37 surprise me or else why do I bother listening to
00:51:39 you know what this sounds to me like it sounds like
00:51:41 these people have been doing this and they
00:51:43 they have been told that their performance is
00:51:45 sufficient for the effect they're trying to
00:51:47 achieve of connecting to the audience when
00:51:49 actually that was people just telling them that
00:51:51 it was sufficient when actually it's clearly not
00:51:53 complete like people that write this kind of
00:51:55 cookie cutter poetry that you hear at any
00:51:57 fucking bullshit party of some assholes
00:51:59 getting together and reading their shit it's
00:52:01 they're just complacent here's what it is
00:52:03 they're not they're not they're just not trying
00:52:05 hard enough here's what it is to me it's
00:52:07 a good poem does
00:52:09 not ever need to be
00:52:11 spoken to someone
00:52:13 you read a poem and you feel something if
00:52:15 it's fucking well if it's a good poem if it's
00:52:17 a good point or it's well put together
00:52:19 you can just read it if you
00:52:21 have to like force if you
00:52:23 have to audibly force an emotion into
00:52:25 the audience then you have not written a good
00:52:27 poem you've written a bad poem and you
00:52:29 should be ashamed of yourselves
00:52:31 you know what I got a poem for you guys
00:52:33 tell me tell me I know
00:52:35 this you see this is what a good poem is
00:52:37 and you're you're gonna resonate with this
00:52:39 okay here we go this is called Malia's
00:52:41 poem
00:52:43 dear dad I mean dear president
00:52:45 24 65
00:52:47 always on the job wait who's that
00:52:49 woman and where's my
00:52:51 Malia fuck that's
00:52:53 it that's the whole poem say all of it
00:52:55 there you go that's that's the important
00:52:57 part that's my favorite part
00:52:59 making fun of it
00:53:01 it's the best I don't get it
00:53:03 this listen buddy
00:53:05 episode with your fucking
00:53:07 with your crass
00:53:09 derivative artwork
00:53:11 that doesn't have any value
00:53:13 outside of just referencing
00:53:15 another video
00:53:17 it's like this piece down
00:53:19 and I'm not saying that like
00:53:21 I'm not saying that like reading a poem
00:53:23 invalidates the poem
00:53:25 I'm saying that if a poem has to be read
00:53:27 to have value then it's not a good
00:53:29 poem like no one would read that
00:53:31 ever like read that Jesus guys poems
00:53:33 and think they were deep unless you were like already
00:53:35 your religious moron so never mind
00:53:37 but like for example
00:53:39 I've I've done like open
00:53:41 Mike and I've read poems that I've written
00:53:43 on most of my you know the poems
00:53:45 that I that I there's a video of me doing it
00:53:47 but like the poems that I had written to recite
00:53:49 there were like meant to make people laugh
00:53:51 and like each line was a little punchline and like
00:53:53 you know like who invented the fart
00:53:55 he must have been awfully smart as hard to define what a glorious
00:53:57 time we have in the flatulence starts that's just like
00:53:59 it's just people just hear that and they chuckle
00:54:01 it's just like a little belly laugh like a little belly
00:54:03 laugh lyric and that's fine or like the poem
00:54:05 that I wrote about the newlyweds and there they're both
00:54:07 gross and I'm just like describing
00:54:09 like gross people fucking and each line
00:54:11 makes people laugh that's not what I'm talking about
00:54:13 I'm just talking about like the pseudo
00:54:15 deep pretentious fucking
00:54:17 my my father beat me and I'm a feminist
00:54:19 who believes in Jesus too much
00:54:21 kind of like yeah with the with the
00:54:23 inspirational music the inspirational
00:54:25 music is what gets me the most it's so fucking
00:54:27 transparent
00:54:29 I hate all inspirational music all the time
00:54:31 but you use it
00:54:33 all the time in your videos
00:54:35 I make it inspirational
00:54:37 by the way I use it
00:54:39 it's me with the I'm the one
00:54:41 who supplies the inspiration not the music
00:54:43 but anyway
00:54:45 in fact I'm the one making the music
00:54:47 inspirational when I put music
00:54:49 in my videos
00:54:51 books are not sharing great books are high tier
00:54:53 books are the lowest tier
00:54:55 God damn it that's ridiculous
00:54:57 books are fucking how can you
00:54:59 books are pure books are artistically pure
00:55:01 how can you not place value
00:55:03 on like the the inherent
00:55:05 unique intonation and rhythm of the
00:55:07 written word by various different authors
00:55:09 it's obvious
00:55:11 because mum because fucking
00:55:13 munchy can't read
00:55:15 you can't fucking speak bitch
00:55:17 I just got it right I fixed
00:55:19 my yeah okay yeah
00:55:21 I bet you got it right
00:55:23 we've been talking about mediums as the modern
00:55:25 definition of them is the you know partly it comes
00:55:27 down to like the the means by which
00:55:29 the information is delivered
00:55:31 to the to the consumer and
00:55:33 Jesse himself has a video
00:55:35 criticizing heavily the medium with
00:55:37 which prose is usually
00:55:39 delivered to the consumer in the form of a book that you can't
00:55:41 really hold in any one position
00:55:43 that will be comfortable for that video is retarded
00:55:45 it should never be taken seriously
00:55:47 by anyone who's gonna make
00:55:49 that video yeah obviously physical
00:55:51 media is terrible but like what
00:55:53 that what a book is is getting
00:55:55 to you like the pros contained within
00:55:57 a book is artistically pure
00:55:59 and pros and the written word is like it's the
00:56:01 most efficient way
00:56:03 of fucking taking some intellectual
00:56:05 idea or concept or opinion you have
00:56:07 and fucking communicating it to an audience
00:56:09 and it's beautiful yeah I can
00:56:11 pick in moment minute that's right
00:56:13 it's no no it's not pros is
00:56:15 not pros a tool then
00:56:17 because you can use pros to write scripts
00:56:19 for videos exactly
00:56:21 that's what I'm trying to say
00:56:23 what the fuck off what are you talking about
00:56:25 the way you consume a book is different
00:56:27 the way you consume a book is different is worthless
00:56:29 pros is a medium
00:56:31 critique is not a medium
00:56:33 yeah we know critique is not a medium
00:56:35 but however like if you put a critique in a word
00:56:37 visual is good Ben if you put a critique
00:56:39 as a like a book
00:56:41 a book a physical book or a digital book
00:56:43 or whatever and it is a critique of something else
00:56:45 yeah yeah the tool is critique
00:56:47 yeah that's yeah you know Ben
00:56:49 the tool of critique in your fucking
00:56:51 the medium is a book it's not pros
00:56:53 because pros you can fucking
00:56:55 you mean it's not pros Ben if you love
00:56:57 pros so much why don't you go start
00:56:59 the pros crastinators
00:57:01 got em
00:57:03 oh boy
00:57:05 the reason why that whole how
00:57:07 video games encapsulate all the other
00:57:09 mediums and that's why it's the best it's because
00:57:11 when you're reading a book it's like I'm only
00:57:13 the reading part and like there's only
00:57:15 certain parts of my brain that are being in your
00:57:17 dry side when you're playing a video game
00:57:19 all your senses are being done
00:57:21 every that's gay
00:57:23 I have a problem
00:57:25 I have a problem reading books
00:57:27 I know it's probably stupid
00:57:29 to say this out loud
00:57:31 but I just I can't pick up a book and read it
00:57:33 it's too hard
00:57:35 here's why I'm retarded and Jesse's been
00:57:37 here's why I'm retarded
00:57:39 and Jesse's been right all along
00:57:41 wait let me get it real quick
00:57:43 no I need to hear this it's important
00:57:45 alright alright like
00:57:47 sure yeah like maybe
00:57:49 there's more tools
00:57:51 to use in a video game
00:57:53 comics have art in addition
00:57:55 to pros so they're better
00:57:57 but what it really comes down to is that
00:57:59 great art is made
00:58:01 for its medium and if you
00:58:03 make a work that just
00:58:05 takes the medium you're using
00:58:07 and rings every
00:58:09 bit of meaning and feeling and value
00:58:11 out of it then you've got
00:58:13 a great work of art and it doesn't matter
00:58:15 that like pros is a more limited
00:58:17 work or a medium than
00:58:19 sequential art like if you have
00:58:21 fucking used it to its fullest extents
00:58:23 then you've made a great work of art
00:58:25 and in that and so obviously all mediums
00:58:27 are fucking Jesse was right
00:58:29 Ben admitted it Jesse was right everybody
00:58:31 the day is finally come
00:58:33 when fucking everyone admits that I'm
00:58:35 right and always have been about everything the fucking
00:58:37 confetti the balloons are coming down from the
00:58:39 ceiling I was right twice in this podcast
00:58:41 I was right about everything that I said about
00:58:43 every artistic medium they're all having
00:58:45 the same value and I was also right about
00:58:47 slam poetry having even less value
00:58:49 somehow I was right about both of those
00:58:51 I was right about both things somehow
00:58:53 even though they contradicted each other it doesn't matter
00:58:55 that's why I didn't get into the whole hierarchy
00:58:57 I didn't have a hierarchy I didn't give
00:58:59 anything there's no
00:59:01 smart boys there's no hierarchy
00:59:03 but slam poetry is
00:59:05 still at the bottom of it
00:59:07 yeah and that's what I call
00:59:09 a slam dunk of an argument
00:59:11 that no one can fucking topple
00:59:13 it's uh I just noticed that
00:59:15 after I asked for questions on
00:59:17 Twitter at TP Crasinators
00:59:19 one of the first ones was our friend
00:59:21 mumke at mumke away
00:59:23 who asked the question is analysis
00:59:25 an art form so he's still on this topic
00:59:27 and it has been a drag
00:59:29 I was obviously not one
00:59:31 well he can
00:59:33 just listen back I don't care
00:59:35 to repeat all that shit again
00:59:37 okay I think we're done let's go to questions
00:59:39 we've only been going for like 45 minutes
00:59:41 I just said let's go to questions
00:59:43 thoroughly analyzed analysis as well
00:59:45 as Jesse's
00:59:47 inspirational rightness about all
00:59:49 things I think we can move on to questions
00:59:51 now I know I still watch
00:59:53 how much I hate books I have
00:59:55 we get it dude I hate books
00:59:57 I want to hear it I want to hear it
00:59:59 because I like looking at like
01:00:01 colors books usually aren't in colors
01:00:03 like black and white and they're
01:00:05 hard to look at and they're like
01:00:07 they're like gay ones
01:00:09 what about coloring books
01:00:11 nooooo
01:00:13 nooo
01:00:15 that's three
01:00:17 that's a hat trick
01:00:19 I kind of agree that books are hard to look at
01:00:21 I like books to have
01:00:23 at the beginning of the chapter they have a nice little image
01:00:25 and I'm like aha that's nice
01:00:27 then I continue reading
01:00:29 that's because drawings are better than words that's true
01:00:31 It's nice to have a mixture. It's nice to have a mixture of books.
01:00:33 Nope, nope. You were at the first time.
01:00:35 Yeah, you did it.
01:00:37 I love Killers books. I love color books.
01:00:39 They're so good. I love adding red and green.
01:00:41 I love coloring books. They make me feel smart because I'm three years old.
01:00:43 Yeah, dude.
01:00:45 Woo!
01:00:47 Alright, let's go to some questions here.
01:00:49 Hopefully, we'll find some that aren't retarded.
01:00:51 Now remember, everybody,
01:00:53 Santa's questions all the time.
01:00:55 Did you mean to say art retarded or did you mean to say art related?
01:00:57 Who? Me?
01:00:59 Yeah, you.
01:01:01 You said art retarded.
01:01:03 You said art retarded.
01:01:05 Well, whatever I said, make it the good one.
01:01:07 That's what I intended to say.
01:01:09 Right.
01:01:11 Yeah, everybody, make sure you ask us questions
01:01:13 at tpcrastinators on Twitter.
01:01:15 Everybody, remember, don't be retarded.
01:01:17 Before we do that,
01:01:19 we should mention that this podcast,
01:01:21 this PCP is now on patreon.com.
01:01:23 Oh, you're going to say that at the end.
01:01:25 This week,
01:01:27 we're putting up the patreon.
01:01:29 No, you're underplaying this, guys.
01:01:31 Huge announcement, everybody.
01:01:33 There is in the description
01:01:35 a link to the
01:01:37 procrastinators podcast
01:01:39 patreon link.
01:01:41 We're doing a thing.
01:01:43 We're all of our main weekly episodes like this,
01:01:45 or perhaps the drawcasts when we do them,
01:01:47 or the races, any of our main PCP content
01:01:49 is going to be added to that patreon.
01:01:51 We've got to stretch that.
01:01:53 We're definitely not putting the podcast on there.
01:01:55 Do not worry.
01:01:57 It's only going to be
01:01:59 major PCP
01:02:01 group things
01:02:03 like this main podcast.
01:02:05 The drawcast and races.
01:02:07 Basically, if you like hearing us talk,
01:02:09 but you hate all of us individually
01:02:11 and all of our individual creative endeavors,
01:02:13 you don't have to pay for that bullshit.
01:02:15 I've seen people.
01:02:17 I've seen quite a few people wanting to give money
01:02:19 directly to you.
01:02:21 Word on the street is...
01:02:23 Look at this little fucking bird.
01:02:25 It's dead now, but look, it had a message.
01:02:27 What? Okay.
01:02:29 If you donate amount of money
01:02:31 that I forgot, you're going to get in your
01:02:33 fucking little inbox. You're going to open it.
01:02:35 What's in here? Any more procrastinators?
01:02:37 It's a fucking bonus episode.
01:02:39 It's a bonus episode.
01:02:41 Oh, that's right.
01:02:43 Bonus episode.
01:02:45 $5 at the $5 Patreon amount.
01:02:47 You get access to extra
01:02:49 episode of PCP.
01:02:51 More content that you can literally even
01:02:53 suck.
01:02:55 Is it one a month?
01:02:57 Is it one extra per month?
01:02:59 We're going to do one a month.
01:03:01 This is just an
01:03:03 extra thing that we're going to do
01:03:05 to get people to give us money.
01:03:07 There's a hugely
01:03:09 important factor that needs to be said.
01:03:11 This is not
01:03:13 replacing any of our own Patreons.
01:03:15 If I hear of one goddamn one of two motherfuckers
01:03:17 who unpledged to any of us to pledge to the
01:03:19 PCP, then we'll shut it all down.
01:03:21 We'll shut the whole thing down.
01:03:23 We might.
01:03:25 No one unpledged
01:03:27 from anyone.
01:03:29 We would really prefer that this be
01:03:31 a secondary concern, I think,
01:03:33 for our individual ones.
01:03:35 I would just like to say that
01:03:37 the money from the Patreon
01:03:39 is going to be divided amongst the members
01:03:41 based on how many appearances
01:03:43 they make in the podcast.
01:03:45 On some level, it will also go
01:03:47 to enhancing infrastructure.
01:03:49 For example, we're actually
01:03:51 going to pay someone to edit
01:03:53 so as to stick to a schedule.
01:03:55 We're also in the near future.
01:03:57 Behind the scenes is too much information.
01:03:59 I think that's appropriate to say,
01:04:01 but as soon enough, we'll be working on trying
01:04:03 to get it up on iTunes and shit.
01:04:05 I'm going to pocket all that money.
01:04:07 Everybody!
01:04:09 Skimming a little off the top.
01:04:11 Basically, all that matters.
01:04:13 We're looking to expand and this money
01:04:15 is the way that we can make some
01:04:17 infrastructure enhancements that would
01:04:19 have just come out of our pockets, but otherwise
01:04:21 there will be ways to do it.
01:04:23 Listen guys.
01:04:25 You fans, you all know
01:04:27 that I'm God
01:04:29 and that if you press one
01:04:31 to me right now in the comments
01:04:33 I get even more
01:04:35 power.
01:04:37 But here, if you donate one
01:04:39 dollar,
01:04:41 that's the equivalent of a thousand
01:04:43 times.
01:04:45 I can't believe I didn't think to make
01:04:47 the one dollar pledge like a
01:04:49 monthly related one thing.
01:04:51 I got to do that as soon as we're done.
01:04:53 That's the important thing to remember.
01:04:55 Everyone give us money,
01:04:57 but also still give me money
01:04:59 on top of that.
01:05:01 Patreon.com
01:05:03 Slash.
01:05:05 The pro and fascinators part.
01:05:07 There we go.
01:05:09 Thank you.
01:05:11 There we go.
01:05:13 I think is what it's called.
01:05:15 It's patreon.com slash the
01:05:17 procrastinators.
01:05:19 If that doesn't work
01:05:21 just click the link in the description.
01:05:23 It might change, but I think that's what it's going to be.
01:05:25 This is going to be the death of us.
01:05:27 That's fucking all
01:05:29 sorted and done with.
01:05:31 We've done it everyone.
01:05:33 It's been a long time coming.
01:05:35 Let's go to some questions.
01:05:37 Here is a one for Munchie
01:05:39 to the group.
01:05:41 What level of Christ consciousness
01:05:43 are you all on?
01:05:45 I'm at the highest level baby.
01:05:47 I'm level 7 bro.
01:05:49 By the way that's by
01:05:51 Chiaro333.
01:05:53 Munchie can you scan me?
01:05:55 I don't know how to figure it out.
01:05:57 Alright.
01:05:59 Let me see.
01:06:01 You got that nice pale skin.
01:06:03 You got those fucking
01:06:05 oh yeah bro.
01:06:07 Alright.
01:06:09 2.
01:06:11 Are most people at 2?
01:06:13 What are most people at?
01:06:15 The default if you're like
01:06:17 if you're like Ben St.
01:06:19 you're at 1.
01:06:21 Man I'm down with
01:06:23 the Christ consciousness.
01:06:25 Ben St. the default man.
01:06:27 What the fuck?
01:06:29 That's like the worst thing anyone's ever said to me.
01:06:31 You open the character creation menu
01:06:33 and just the default
01:06:35 he's just the template
01:06:37 from which you add shit.
01:06:39 That's fucking hilarious.
01:06:41 Here's a question from
01:06:43 our old friend Onwe.
01:06:45 What's our Christ consciousness?
01:06:47 I mean how deep do you want to go?
01:06:49 Give us all a first score.
01:06:51 Alright Jesse
01:06:53 you're at a 4.
01:06:55 Yeah!
01:06:57 That's pretty good.
01:06:59 Your chocolates are moderately aligned.
01:07:01 Nate
01:07:03 You're
01:07:05 you're at a 2.
01:07:07 You have room for improvement.
01:07:09 I agree. I hate Jesus.
01:07:11 Ben is at a 1 of course.
01:07:13 I'm at a 7.
01:07:15 Davoo is at an 8.
01:07:17 Oh shit.
01:07:19 Oh my god.
01:07:21 Does that mean Jesus is his son?
01:07:23 He just edited his own consciousness
01:07:25 to be Christ low light.
01:07:27 Yeah I know it's fucking cheating
01:07:29 but you know I have to abide by the rules.
01:07:31 It's not a game, not the player.
01:07:33 I love this saying.
01:07:35 I love the fucking Christ consciousness.
01:07:37 That's how you know that
01:07:39 Nate is a fucking zero.
01:07:41 You're a fucking zero.
01:07:43 I'm such a disgusting piece of cake.
01:07:45 We'll have to ask the slam poetry Jesus guided
01:07:47 to know what Christ consciousness truly means.
01:07:49 Yeah.
01:07:51 Christ consciousness is how many dimensions
01:07:53 you can travel basically.
01:07:55 It's high how your consciousness
01:07:57 and how
01:07:59 so I'm a 4 dimensional being
01:08:01 is what you're saying.
01:08:03 And Hippo are you saying?
01:08:05 No I was just
01:08:07 remarking on the fact that Jesse is half the amount of God.
01:08:09 That Davoo is.
01:08:11 Ben's a 1 dimensional being.
01:08:15 I'm a 1 dimensional character.
01:08:17 I'm a flat character.
01:08:19 He's just a line.
01:08:21 Yeah just a line.
01:08:23 Here's a silly question.
01:08:25 Yes.
01:08:27 Here's a silly question,
01:08:29 but it might be interesting to hear.
01:08:31 Anui on me asks,
01:08:33 at what point did you realize you were internet famous?
01:08:35 Right now.
01:08:37 When you asked that question.
01:08:39 I know exactly when I realized it.
01:08:41 Her name was Caitlyn.
01:08:43 None of us are.
01:08:45 I don't think any of us really are.
01:08:47 I realized I was internet famous
01:08:49 when Jesse made cruising with Munchie.
01:08:51 That's when I realized.
01:08:53 Wait what was cruising with Munchie?
01:08:55 It was all the Munchie isms
01:08:57 from the memes that need to die podcast
01:08:59 in its own video with Vaporwave in the background.
01:09:01 I felt internet famous
01:09:03 as soon as Gibb and Take featured
01:09:05 Kagan Phantom in an analysis assemblage.
01:09:07 I agree.
01:09:09 I think generally being put in someone else's video
01:09:11 or someone making a video about you
01:09:13 makes you internet famous.
01:09:15 But the moment
01:09:17 I can definitely
01:09:19 I also felt pretty famous
01:09:21 in my current nonpony incarnation
01:09:23 when
01:09:25 Joji's Magic Supplies made an analysis video
01:09:27 fucking analyzing my comics.
01:09:29 Go watch that.
01:09:31 It's like comparing the Vapers
01:09:33 to Watamote and
01:09:35 one other thing that I forget.
01:09:37 Some wrestling guy recently made
01:09:39 a top 5
01:09:41 he made a top 5 AMVs of all time
01:09:43 even though he's not really an anime guy.
01:09:45 He put MyGurr and Login1 at number 2.
01:09:47 He was weird.
01:09:49 He started it off and was using mine
01:09:51 of how you can make a genius one
01:09:53 in this thing he was doing.
01:09:55 Mine was only number 2
01:09:57 and some Run of the Mill
01:09:59 Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood one
01:10:01 was number 1.
01:10:03 I don't understand why he set it up that way
01:10:05 if I wasn't going to be number 1.
01:10:07 That was cool. That was nice.
01:10:09 Second best guy ever.
01:10:11 I don't know about...
01:10:13 I just thought that was a weird way to structure it.
01:10:15 That's kind of harder to wrap my head around
01:10:17 but having fans
01:10:19 that actually appreciate me
01:10:21 I remember that first happened as a moment
01:10:23 when some comic was like
01:10:25 I'd be sad if DeVoo stopped making videos
01:10:27 and I'm like whoa
01:10:29 someone would be sad if I didn't exist.
01:10:31 That's way more meaningful than someone being happy
01:10:33 that you do exist.
01:10:35 I agree.
01:10:37 I think of internet famous as something a bit bigger
01:10:39 than just having fans that are in a group
01:10:41 that can be...
01:10:43 It's still thousands of people
01:10:45 I think internet famous is when
01:10:47 you haven't satisfied
01:10:49 some incredibly specific standard
01:10:51 that they think you are obligated to follow
01:10:53 because of your level of fame.
01:10:55 Internet famous truly
01:10:57 is when the first time you get laid
01:10:59 from being a fan.
01:11:01 That's exactly what I was going to say.
01:11:03 I remember the moment where I truly felt
01:11:05 like wow I've made it
01:11:07 was in 2013
01:11:09 when the first time that I fucked a fan
01:11:11 when she got on a plane
01:11:13 and came all the way here
01:11:15 to my dingy little basement
01:11:17 just to cuck her boyfriend
01:11:19 and get the endless D
01:11:21 for three days.
01:11:23 I looked up at the stars
01:11:25 the night that I dropped her off at the airport
01:11:27 to send her back on her way home
01:11:29 because I was done with her.
01:11:31 I went out and I laid in the grass
01:11:33 and I looked at the stars
01:11:35 and I looked at the Big Dipper
01:11:37 and I reminisced about my Big Dipper
01:11:39 going into her.
01:11:41 I said I truly made it
01:11:43 part of the story as well.
01:11:45 Everyone was there.
01:11:47 Donatello was there
01:11:49 and Commander Shepard won
01:11:51 the whole gang.
01:11:53 Did Donatello get a turn?
01:11:55 No. None of my retarded characters
01:11:57 are allowed to encroach on my fornication activities.
01:12:03 I've seen your sex tape Jesse.
01:12:05 I've seen Cole Corona's sex tape.
01:12:07 I know the truth.
01:12:09 He's uploaded it
01:12:11 on every streaming site known to man.
01:12:13 He's been blocked from
01:12:15 every web hosting site ever.
01:12:17 He's a monster.
01:12:19 Here's one that's kind of relevant
01:12:21 to our discussion today.
01:12:23 Donovan at Donovan on Guts
01:12:25 asks, what's the most
01:12:27 out there or difficult to get into
01:12:29 piece of media that you enjoy?
01:12:31 We're just kind of relevant to our discussion about media.
01:12:33 Homestuck, easy.
01:12:35 Homestuck is super fucking easy.
01:12:37 It's literally like this.
01:12:39 Homestuck is hard to get into
01:12:41 because I hate it and I have no desire to get into it.
01:12:43 Homestuck's fucking easy.
01:12:45 Everyone who says it's long or hard to do is gay.
01:12:47 That's like saying fucking and handling a hard media.
01:12:49 It's not just that it's long though.
01:12:51 It's that it's long and also queer as fuck.
01:12:53 Hold on. Very important difference here.
01:12:55 Hard to get into for you
01:12:57 back when you first got into it
01:12:59 or hard for people to get into in general.
01:13:01 That's a very important distinction.
01:13:03 That's pretty hard to get into.
01:13:05 For you.
01:13:07 Also, oh, you know what?
01:13:09 Fucking dwarf fortress.
01:13:11 Yeah, you know what? Actually,
01:13:13 I really enjoyed dwarf fortress.
01:13:15 I know I would love it. Yeah, I have not yet
01:13:17 succeeded in getting into it, so I'm going to go with that too.
01:13:19 I have one.
01:13:21 It's the hardest thing for me to get into
01:13:23 was the Legend of Zelda franchise
01:13:25 because I always hated Link from Plain Smash
01:13:27 and everyone liking Link more than Samus.
01:13:29 And that's why
01:13:31 I didn't want to get into it. That's really hard.
01:13:33 I think
01:13:35 that any anime
01:13:37 is just like chink shit going on.
01:13:39 And it's like...
01:13:41 You're right about that, dude.
01:13:43 Okay, here's a juicy question.
01:13:45 At
01:13:47 Varamir9 wants to know
01:13:49 are there any new memes that need
01:13:51 to die?
01:13:53 Any big ones that people
01:13:55 have been burning to see
01:13:57 executed? Well, the Undertaler needs to live.
01:13:59 Yeah, he has to live.
01:14:01 He must live. Yeah, he's got a bright future.
01:14:03 Oh my gosh, it's been
01:14:05 a freaking other day. Did I miss the
01:14:07 PCP recording today?
01:14:09 Oh, I'm sorry.
01:14:11 Okay,
01:14:13 I'm leaving now.
01:14:15 Bye.
01:14:17 He was banging his chest on the way out
01:14:19 in case he didn't hear.
01:14:21 What a good man.
01:14:23 He was so polite.
01:14:25 He just wanted to know.
01:14:27 When he knew his service wasn't easy to do that.
01:14:29 We're never mad at the
01:14:31 people there.
01:14:33 It's hard to be, because you're so oppressed
01:14:35 in our, you know...
01:14:37 Never mind, moving on.
01:14:39 I mean the need to die.
01:14:41 I didn't have the wherewithal to follow through
01:14:43 with that statement. I think I'm the only one
01:14:45 that this question is relevant to, but it's
01:14:47 quick and I thought I'd answer it.
01:14:49 At MichaelCera4 just asked,
01:14:51 for those of you who have taken Nihongo,
01:14:53 or that's Niponese, for those of you
01:14:55 who don't speak the devil's tongue,
01:14:57 who've taken Nihongo class,
01:14:59 what was your experience like as Japanese?
01:15:01 Talking about Japanese.
01:15:03 I listened to some
01:15:05 learn Japanese tapes on tape that I got
01:15:07 from the library one summer, and it was kind of fun.
01:15:09 I would say, I really enjoyed it.
01:15:11 I enjoyed learning the alphabet.
01:15:13 It was like a transforming experience
01:15:15 once I was able to read the letters
01:15:17 of the Japanese language, the hiragana and katakana,
01:15:19 and I was never very good at the speaking,
01:15:21 but I think it's really fun, so I encourage you to do it.
01:15:23 Wait, wait, wait, wait, Nate,
01:15:25 why do you think this doesn't apply to me?
01:15:27 Fluent fucking Japanese.
01:15:35 We don't all have that level
01:15:37 of Christ consciousness.
01:15:41 Yeah, when you hit Christ
01:15:43 consciousness level 5 and above,
01:15:45 you automatically unlock speaking Japanese
01:15:47 as a bonus fee.
01:15:49 I've been trying to get into Japanese for a long time.
01:15:51 There's a great website,
01:15:53 JapanesePod101.com
01:15:55 who's just like so fucking,
01:15:57 he's so goddamn enthusiastic.
01:15:59 We're like, guys, now we're going to talk about grammar.
01:16:01 I can't wait.
01:16:03 And the Japanese people
01:16:05 who we co-host with are like, yep,
01:16:07 and it's cool, so that was my experience.
01:16:09 It's cool, I just need to...
01:16:11 It's simply a matter of prioritizing
01:16:13 it over other things I can do,
01:16:15 so once I'm out of other things to do,
01:16:17 I'll get back to that.
01:16:19 I'll prioritize you over other things I can do, you fuck.
01:16:25 What's, do you know what that means?
01:16:27 It means Naruto.
01:16:29 Yeah.
01:16:31 Oh wait, I was thinking of a different word.
01:16:33 Yeah, weird Narutoism.
01:16:35 Itadakimasu.
01:16:37 Itadakimasu.
01:16:39 Oh wait, what are you talking about?
01:16:41 I know perfect Japanese.
01:16:43 Sakurakangikimasu.
01:16:45 Sakurakangikimasu.
01:16:49 Smile DK, that's the only Japanese word I know.
01:16:51 Smile DK for the camera.
01:16:55 It's me.
01:16:57 I'm back to smile for the camera.
01:16:59 It's me, the Donkey Kong trailer.
01:17:01 I'm a fucking
01:17:25 You guys, should we open up the suggestions
01:17:27 ideas for draw casts?
01:17:29 We should, yes,
01:17:31 actually we should, because I really want
01:17:33 to do more of them.
01:17:35 Tweet that right now and we'll think about it.
01:17:37 Yeah, yeah, yeah, do it, do it.
01:17:39 Don't tell me it'll live my life.
01:17:41 Draw casts, draw cast suggestions,
01:17:43 because we're all just completely at a loss
01:17:45 for what to draw.
01:17:47 Who will draw favours YouTube?
01:17:49 No.
01:17:51 We'll draw cubes, we'll draw
01:17:53 rectangles, we'll draw
01:17:55 cones.
01:17:57 I have no original character who is a box,
01:17:59 so that would work out.
01:18:01 Does the box have any distinguishing characteristics?
01:18:03 Her name is Mrs. Box,
01:18:05 and she's a dolled up gal.
01:18:07 That sounds awesome.
01:18:09 That sounds rad. Hey, Munchy, when's
01:18:11 fucking Investigator coming out? Shut the fuck up, Ben.
01:18:13 You fucking black sympathizer,
01:18:15 it'll come out when you're around. I really want it.
01:18:17 I want it right now.
01:18:19 You're dead. I love you.
01:18:21 Thank you, I love you too.
01:18:23 I care about you, and I just want the best
01:18:25 for you.
01:18:27 I'll renounce my devilish ways
01:18:29 and get back to work.
01:18:31 Thank you.
01:18:33 That's all I wanted.
01:18:35 That's all I wanted to hear. You got to retake that
01:18:37 Christ consciousness and put it to good work.
01:18:39 Okay, I think we're done. All these questions are bullshit.
01:18:41 Ask better questions next time, you idiots.
01:18:43 You can't be coming on for anything.
01:18:45 Okay, thanks for listening, everybody.
01:18:47 www.picture.com.
01:18:49 Yeah, make sure to go to
01:18:51 $1 for Munchy, $1 for $1, $1, $1, $1.
01:18:53 Click the link in the description.
01:18:55 The patreon.com
01:18:57 slash procrastinators meme is going to
01:18:59 slowly push out the patreon.com
01:19:01 slash ben saint meme.
01:19:03 No!
01:19:05 And make sure that you
01:19:07 ask us more questions
01:19:09 and give us topics at TPCrastinators
01:19:11 so go follow us on Twitter and shit.
01:19:13 And suggestions for drawcasts.
01:19:15 And drawcast suggestions suggest everything.
01:19:17 Whatever.
01:19:19 Easily.
01:19:21 That's the good one.
01:19:23 It definitely has the least artistic value
01:19:25 of any content.
01:19:27 Oh, yeah.
01:19:29 We need to discuss how much value podcasts have.
01:19:31 Wow.
01:19:33 Zero.
01:19:35 You really are the least
01:19:37 artistic value.
01:19:39 That's what you say.
01:19:41 No, but you know what?
01:19:43 That makes this episode self-referential
01:19:45 and we're going to be doing it high.
01:19:47 This is the best podcast.
01:19:49 Okay, yeah, all right.
01:19:51 It's confirmed.
01:19:53 All right, thanks for this everybody.
01:19:55 We're going to see you next time.
01:19:57 Go fuck yourself.
01:19:59 Bye bye.
01:20:01 $1 for Munchy, $1 for Munchy, $1 for Munchy, $1 for Munchy, $1 for Munchy, $1 for Munchy, $1 for Munchy.
01:20:03 I'm shit supposed to
01:20:05 be working
01:20:07 right now.
01:20:09 I'm supposed
01:20:11 to be working
01:20:13 right now.
01:20:15 But I'm not working.
01:20:17 I'm doing nothing.
01:20:19 My dick I'm
01:20:21 jerking.
01:20:23 Myself I'm sucking.
01:20:25 I am an asshole.
01:20:27 I am a stupid.
01:20:29 I've got a
01:20:31 deadline.
01:20:33 Don't want to do it.
01:20:43 What the hell is wrong with me?
01:20:45 I'm supposed
01:20:47 to be making
01:20:49 money.
01:20:51 I'm supposed
01:20:53 to be creating
01:20:55 funny.
01:20:57 Think that the people
01:20:59 gladly will pay
01:21:01 for artistic
01:21:03 genius.
01:21:05 That's what they came for.
01:21:07 Instead I'm tweeting
01:21:09 hashtag repeating
01:21:11 That's why
01:21:13 there's no heat
01:21:15 and holes in the ceiling.
01:21:19 Yeah.
01:21:21 It's quite the burden.
01:21:23 It's a hard knock life.
01:21:25 Being
01:21:27 a genius.
