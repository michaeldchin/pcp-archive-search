00:00:00 Hello and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I am your hero and God Emperor, the best guy ever, Bestie Boy.
00:00:07 Thanks for joining us once again. And today, we've got, in addition to our regular Digibro over here.
00:00:13 Hey buddy boy.
00:00:14 My partner in crime. We've got two outsiders, two guest people as we like to have some times, who in recent times, I've become friends with who I really like.
00:00:24 And I think make great videos that you guys should definitely check out. And you probably already have, to be honest.
00:00:29 So first is The Gaming Brit.
00:00:31 I hate these things because this is why I've got to introduce myself and sound all charismatic just by saying my name.
00:00:37 It's okay. The only goal is to let people hear your voice so they can distinguish you later.
00:00:42 My name is Charlie. I do The Gaming Brit on YouTube. I review games.
00:00:46 Yeah, like Hyperbit Hero is here with us. He was the one who said, yo, yo Charlie, I'm gonna be on PCP tomorrow.
00:00:58 Yeah. That's right.
00:01:00 And he was like, you're not invited.
00:01:03 And I was like, yo, you've watched this podcast before, right? Things get savage. You're gonna need someone in there backing you up, man.
00:01:09 Like, you got him. You got him. You got him.
00:01:12 So he was like, okay. You don't just do PCP without a partner. It's a dangerous drug.
00:01:18 This is a tag team match. So let's hear from you Hyperbit Hero. What's happening?
00:01:23 Not much.
00:01:25 Well, there you have it. All right. All right. So we're doing things a little differently today.
00:01:32 So we're gonna start with one topic. And if things go long, which they probably will, if we run out of stuff to say for the first one,
00:01:39 we still need to fill some fucking time. We're just gonna go into our second one.
00:01:42 But our first one is a sort of, it's sort of nebulously defined right now. We're gonna flush it out.
00:01:48 But the word that I want to use, the word that I want to use is cred fags. You know, cred fags.
00:01:55 There is no Urban Dictionary definition for this because we just made it up. In fact, we should enter this into Urban Dictionary,
00:02:00 our own definition we come up with. How full circle will that be? So why don't, was it Charlie?
00:02:07 Charlie came up with it, right?
00:02:09 Yeah. Why don't you tell us about this?
00:02:11 Well, I just find that today on the internet when, you know, we all tweet, we all do our YouTube videos,
00:02:17 and we all meme it up. Sometimes we're all a bit guilty of doing that. And sometimes, obviously, you know,
00:02:23 people want to be in on the popular things and what other people are playing, what other people are talking about.
00:02:29 And sometimes they go out of their way to try and weasel their way in to these popular things.
00:02:39 Yeah.
00:02:40 Obviously not that interested in just being part of the franchise, the anime or the game.
00:02:47 And it's like so annoying because you get so many questions on YouTube and Twitter and stuff about which parts of this franchise
00:02:53 can I skip and like where should I start. When obviously it's just if you're interested and you care and you want to have
00:02:59 lots of entertainment, just start from the beginning and wake your way up. Like what's the big deal, you know?
00:03:05 I know Hayden gets this a lot as well, especially with the...
00:03:08 The thing is like, you know, they do want to get into it. They just want to get into it as quickly as possible,
00:03:15 as easy as possible. They don't want to fucking experience the story or anything.
00:03:20 Like of course, talking about the Yakuza franchise, that's where I get to ask this all the time.
00:03:26 Listen, you want to get into Yakuza, there's one just called Yakuza. That's the fucking one to do.
00:03:33 Dude, oh my god, I gotta tell you, fucking, I can't tell you how many times I've gotten this question and it baffles me
00:03:40 that anyone has to ask this, which is, what order do I watch Neon Genesis Evangelion?
00:03:46 There's only one order!
00:03:49 There's a TV series called Neon Genesis Evangelion, a movie called The End of Evangelion,
00:03:58 and then a TV show called Rebuild of Evangelion, or a movie series called Rebuild of Evangelion.
00:04:05 I'm not following, you need to break it down.
00:04:07 The watch order is in the title.
00:04:09 And, you know, even a lot of the times you can kind of follow a progression of, you know, one, two, three, four.
00:04:15 They're structured, you know?
00:04:17 Like Charlie's saying, the best advice is usually go to Wikipedia and look at the chronology and watch them in the order they released it.
00:04:25 If you want to be a serious investigative journalist, you can put in the extra mile and go to Wikipedia and look it up, you know?
00:04:32 It baffles me, because even with like the smallest of franchises, it happens, you know, I'm big into my Devil May Cry,
00:04:40 and I get questions like, can I skip to three? Can I just skip all these?
00:04:46 Because I know three is the one with the memes, right? That's the one with all the jokes that I want to be in on.
00:04:51 But the biggest joke is Devil May Cry 2, though.
00:04:54 It's like, there are four games, guys.
00:04:58 You don't, like, that's what confuses me, right?
00:05:01 And numbered for your pleasure.
00:05:03 Hold on, Charlie. Are you saying you think everyone should play DMC 2?
00:05:06 Like, even knowing that it's...
00:05:08 You know, I am two ways about that, actually, because it is a terrible game,
00:05:11 but at the same time, if you play two and then you play three, it's like, whoa, you're experiencing this jumping quality, you know?
00:05:17 I have a lot of sympathy for that viewpoint.
00:05:19 I agree. I would like everyone to play.
00:05:21 If they, like, you know, people bring up Final Fantasy as an example of games that you pretty much can skip,
00:05:27 but I would really like it if people would, when they get into the series, play all of them in order,
00:05:31 because that gives you so much context and, like, a lot can be lost if you don't...
00:05:36 And I didn't. I started with Seven, it was my first Final Fantasy,
00:05:39 but I look back at what old fags have done when they've played through the whole series in order,
00:05:43 and seeing that growth happen is such a beautiful thing.
00:05:46 And that's when, like, they talk about, like, classical long-term fans.
00:05:49 Yeah, then the disappointment when you get to 13 can be all the more sweet.
00:05:53 Yeah, that's right.
00:05:54 If you boot up Devil May Cry 3 and experience that opening after playing through two
00:06:00 and the way far that it was, it's like, like, it intensifies the passion of that scene, you know?
00:06:05 And you know what else it does as an ancillary benefit is if you start...
00:06:09 Let's say, like, a new person started playing Final Fantasy when 13 came out,
00:06:12 and they're like, I'm gonna play 13. It's numbered 13 of the series, but I'm gonna start with this.
00:06:16 And if they don't like it, they're like, well, Final Fantasy's done, you know, I'm done with it.
00:06:20 Like, Hayden, tell them how silly it is, especially with Yakuza,
00:06:26 how people want to start so much with Yakuza 3.
00:06:30 Because 3 isn't that good compared to 2 at all.
00:06:34 Well, it's because Yakuza 3 literally begins with the ending of Yakuza 2.
00:06:39 Like, it's a continuation of, like, the same cutscene?
00:06:44 I think, no, I think, because especially with Yakuza, it's such a seasonal series, really,
00:06:50 when you think about, like, each game is like a season, really, and like a long-running crime drama.
00:06:54 So it's like the silliest series.
00:06:56 Hey, there's some people who jump into TV shows like Season 5.
00:07:00 You know, I'll say, I mean, for some defense of this, I do think that it's entirely possible
00:07:07 to play one of the later ones, and then, you know, that makes you want to go back and do the rest.
00:07:13 And I think, depending on the series, it can be fine.
00:07:17 Like, you know, the Souls series, for instance.
00:07:20 Like, Demon's Souls was not very widely known, because it was a PSD exclusive,
00:07:26 it was a, like, not an indie game, but it was like, you know, not, well, it's a weird obscure Japanese game.
00:07:33 Dark Souls then blew up super huge, and I do think a lot of Dark Souls fans went back and played Demon's Souls,
00:07:40 you know, and like, and most people got into it through Dark Souls, but it also wasn't even presented as though it were a sequel.
00:07:47 That's fine though, it's like, it's when people like with Yakuza start asking, is there a recap of two and one in three?
00:07:54 Can I just read it?
00:07:56 Yeah, it's when you start to ask the questions, like, what can I do to make up for the fact that I haven't played the first games?
00:08:01 It's like, just fucking play them, dude.
00:08:03 I would never tell people to not jump into a series at any point.
00:08:08 I have to play Devil's Advocate here, because my brother Victor is a hardcore cred-fag.
00:08:15 I think we're using this term correctly, but he, because me and him have gotten into arguments over this,
00:08:23 specifically because of me following Charlie and Hayden on Twitter,
00:08:28 because I've seen these guys make this argument over and over again that like,
00:08:32 if you want to get into a franchise, play them all, right?
00:08:35 And I've thought about it and been like, yeah, you know, I kind of agree.
00:08:39 I think it's the healthiest way, you know, I've never played through like Metal Gear, for instance,
00:08:44 but if I did, I would want to start from Metal Gear Solid because,
00:08:47 Oh yeah, for sure, for sure.
00:08:49 For what it's worth, technically you should start from Metal Gear, but you know, like,
00:08:54 I would like to play all of them in order if I was going to.
00:08:57 And my brother Victor, who has only played through Metal Gear Solid 4,
00:09:03 Oh no, the worst one.
00:09:06 But it's one of his favorite games ever.
00:09:10 And here's where we get into something complicated, because Victor's argument is,
00:09:14 yeah, but you'll never play them, which is a sound argument.
00:09:19 Because for instance, okay, the Witcher series, right?
00:09:22 Super Bunny Hub did this whole video series on the three Witcher games and I was like, cool.
00:09:26 Now I kind of understand them and stuff and it really seems to me like the Witcher 3 is the only one I'm going to really get into.
00:09:33 Because the Witcher 2 seems like it's too hard and the Witcher 1 seems like the controls suck.
00:09:38 So like, why not just skip to Witcher 3, but at the same time,
00:09:41 I know that there's a lot of references to the past games,
00:09:44 that there's a sort of an ongoing narrative through all three games.
00:09:47 And so I keep saying to my brother, like, I'd really like to play through Witcher 1 and 2.
00:09:52 And he's like, yeah, but you'll never do it.
00:09:54 You will never play through Witcher 1 and 2.
00:09:56 And there's a chance you'll miss out on what could be one of your favorite games, Witcher 3, if you just play it.
00:10:02 But you'll never play it because you're waiting for Witcher 1 and 2.
00:10:06 And I don't think he's wrong, because I don't think I'll ever play through all three of them.
00:10:10 But why won't you play them?
00:10:12 Because I don't really play a lot of video games in the first place.
00:10:16 So it's like a time management thing.
00:10:18 But when I look at myself with that argument, like, I played all the Final Fantasies
00:10:23 and there's a million of them.
00:10:25 And it's, you know, I think that that kind of argument.
00:10:27 I played them all in high school, didn't you, when you had like lots of time
00:10:31 and like you could just do that.
00:10:33 But all that is, is that's making concessions.
00:10:35 You're making concessions to not take on a responsibility to do something.
00:10:39 And like, if you're willing to compromise, then okay, you can go be a guy who manages his time efficiently,
00:10:45 but you're also a cred fag.
00:10:47 That's the trade I've been making.
00:10:49 That's what it is, you know?
00:10:51 Yeah.
00:10:52 Oh, sorry, go on.
00:10:53 No, you can go ahead.
00:10:54 No, I was just going to say that I feel like whenever I'm like,
00:10:56 because I'm in the same position with the Witcher,
00:10:58 I feel like the third game looks really interesting
00:11:00 but I want to play the other two first and I'm going around to it.
00:11:02 But I feel like when I don't get around to it, I'm just going on to play another thing.
00:11:06 And the thing that weirds me out about cred fags is, you know,
00:11:13 it seems like people just want to have, like, to me, playing a long series, playing a lot of content,
00:11:21 it's still content and entertainment.
00:11:23 And that's why I really don't get why you'd want to sort of spend more money on more products and more things
00:11:32 when you have a few that can sustain you for a long time.
00:11:35 Yeah, that deeply fascinates me as well.
00:11:38 And I, from observing my brother, who at this point I'm thinking of as the ultimate cred fag,
00:11:43 because he does everything that we're insulting here.
00:11:47 Fuck you, Victor.
00:11:48 Like, watching the way he plays games, like, he can seemingly only get excited about a game
00:11:54 if there's some kind of hype, you know?
00:11:57 Like, even if it's just him, even if no one else cares about the game, it has to be, like, new and fresh.
00:12:03 Because, like, he has all these...
00:12:05 He sounds like a big LMFAO fan.
00:12:07 He has so many games that he has never beaten.
00:12:10 Which I am too, by the way.
00:12:12 Shut up.
00:12:13 He has so many games that he's never beaten, that he'll never go back to,
00:12:17 that he has, like, you know, this huge stockade of games.
00:12:19 But for some reason, it'll be like, you know, a new game comes out and he's like,
00:12:22 I'm gonna go buy that.
00:12:23 And I'm like, well, what about the last game you never finished?
00:12:26 And he's like, yeah, but I'm not hype about that.
00:12:28 This one's a new game.
00:12:30 And so it's new and now I'm excited, you know?
00:12:33 And it's like, if he doesn't play through a game when it's new and all at once,
00:12:38 and, like, beat it, then he'll never beat it, you know?
00:12:41 If it stops being new and it fades into the background of his collection,
00:12:45 he'll never finish it.
00:12:46 It'll just sit there forever.
00:12:47 You know, I can't, like, say that that's wrong or anything,
00:12:49 but, like, that's just, that's a very emotion-driven reason to play games
00:12:53 as opposed to any kind of intellectual reason, which is, you know, it's fine.
00:12:56 There's nothing wrong with that, but I feel differently.
00:12:59 It's just weird to watch, because I'm always like,
00:13:01 there's, because for me, I get excited to go play a bunch of Super Nintendo games.
00:13:06 You know, like, for me, the idea of spending $60 on a new game is such an ordeal,
00:13:12 because, like, you know, newer games are longer,
00:13:16 and they really ask for more, like, investment on your time and energy,
00:13:20 and, like, I don't have patience for, like, the cinematic games that come out these days.
00:13:25 You know, we're like, if I'm gonna have to sit through, like,
00:13:28 10 minutes of, like, them taking control away from me, the game's not worth my time anymore.
00:13:33 Like, I need to be, you know, I like Dark Souls and Doom.
00:13:36 Like, those are the recent games that I've enjoyed,
00:13:38 and so, like, and even Doom fucking pissed me off when it did take control away from you.
00:13:43 How long were those sections that it did that? That was too scary.
00:13:46 I would say there's probably grand total 10 minutes of, of, like, forced cutscene.
00:13:52 Yeah, I didn't find it too much.
00:13:53 Compared to what's out there, that's great, but in a game like Doom, it's gonna be annoying.
00:13:56 Yeah, it's still annoying.
00:13:57 And you can't skip it even when you replay the levels.
00:14:00 That's what's particularly annoying.
00:14:02 It's like, guys, look at us being so cheeky, saying fuck, being forced to watch cinematic sequences
00:14:06 through a forced cinematic sequence.
00:14:08 Yeah, that was really obnoxious.
00:14:10 But, but anyways, like, you know, for me, the idea of, like, going out, spending $60 on a game,
00:14:15 that's gonna go down to 20 bucks in six months anyways.
00:14:19 You know, like, for me, it's like an anti-hype cycle.
00:14:22 A new game comes out and everyone gets hyped about it, and I take one look at the price tag,
00:14:25 and I'm like, I don't want to play that for a year.
00:14:28 That's a very, that's a very interesting point, because I think something me and Hayden find
00:14:34 when we're recommending PS2 games that are hard to find, it's like that, like, they find the PS2 game on eBay,
00:14:39 and it's like $40, and it's like, ugh, I don't want to pay $40 for a PS2 game,
00:14:43 but you'll go out and buy the latest shitfest for, like, $50.
00:14:47 Yeah, I love that argument when you made it.
00:14:50 This PRR, thank you.
00:14:53 Yeah, well, like, the, yeah, and I went out because, like, based on Hayden's videos,
00:15:00 I've bought, like, Folklore, which was like 20 bucks, and it was, you know, an older game.
00:15:05 It shouldn't probably be $20, but I wanted that game.
00:15:09 I didn't want to just own a game because it's new.
00:15:13 Like, it's, like, like you said, these are classic games.
00:15:16 It's like if someone was saying, I don't want to pay $15 for Super Mario RPG,
00:15:22 it's like, but you think it's going to be one of your favorite games?
00:15:26 You know, like, that's the funniest thing to me is I'll have people say, like,
00:15:30 oh, that game is a classic, and I've wanted to play it for 10 years, but it's 20 bucks,
00:15:35 and that's too much, and it's like, if it's a classic, it's going to be worth more
00:15:39 than any of the new games that you play.
00:15:42 To play Devil's Advocate, maybe they just feel that way because they have been told
00:15:46 that old games are cheap, and having to pay more money for an old game just conflicts
00:15:50 with what they expect to, you know, do for that.
00:15:53 So, but whatever, I agree.
00:15:55 I agree.
00:15:56 Me and Aiden, here's the thing.
00:15:58 The ultimate cred-fag move is to buy a game because you heard it's good,
00:16:03 just to own it and not play it just to have it on your shelf like a figure or something like that.
00:16:09 So when people come over, they look at your shelf and think, oh, where?
00:16:12 This guy's got a music case and video game.
00:16:15 God, I wish I could believe there's no one like that,
00:16:18 but I know there's people like that.
00:16:21 That's like on another level.
00:16:23 That's like a level where it's like none of us would ever know a person like that.
00:16:26 You know what's like a more reasonable...
00:16:28 Like a woman in disguise, man.
00:16:29 I can see something like that happening when like, you get it.
00:16:32 Like, if you're like a rich kid that your parents just buy shit for you
00:16:35 and they give you a bunch of games and stuff, you know, like FIFA, 2,000...
00:16:39 Aiden's in the military.
00:16:41 I could see this happening there.
00:16:43 In fact, my ex-girlfriend was a little bit like this
00:16:46 because she was in the Air Force and she would just spend lots and lots of money.
00:16:50 And so she would buy a lot of games that she would just never actually play
00:16:54 because she just bought them to spend money, you know?
00:16:56 You gotta spend your money.
00:16:58 Steam has kind of caused that with Steam sales because prices get so low,
00:17:03 you can't afford not to buy these games.
00:17:05 I remember years ago, years ago, Hayden, you told me that one of your friends was like,
00:17:09 I'm gonna buy all the Metal Gear toys even though he hadn't played any of the games.
00:17:14 That was a friend, he said he was gonna buy like a giant couple hundred dollar
00:17:18 like Metal Gear Rex figure even though he's never played any of the games.
00:17:23 I mean, I guess if you really like the design, then that can, you know, exist outside the games.
00:17:29 I don't think he ever showed interest in Metal Gear Solid aside from that.
00:17:33 He's like, I'm gonna buy this shit, bro.
00:17:35 Interesting.
00:17:36 And you know, there's a whole other side to this that we haven't really talked about
00:17:39 which is when people buy specifically obscure things for the sake of them being obscure
00:17:44 and being able to tell on places like V on 4chan, like,
00:17:47 you guys, have you even heard of these fucking games I'm playing right now?
00:17:51 But they're obviously the best because you don't know about them.
00:17:54 And I think they're objectively right.
00:17:57 Yes.
00:17:58 That's my stance.
00:18:03 Yeah, I don't know, like, I don't know how, it's hard to gauge that.
00:18:06 That's really a music thing a lot of the time, but people do that music all the time.
00:18:10 I don't know.
00:18:11 It's hard to gauge with those things because there's, like, how do we know if they don't just like the thing, you know?
00:18:18 But I do, I mean, obviously posturing happens and I think it's a thing people do.
00:18:23 But I don't know.
00:18:25 Personally, I'm someone who loves seeking out obscure shit for real,
00:18:28 so I'll just go out and watch every weird fucking thing, you know?
00:18:32 What's the point of posturing to anonymous people?
00:18:35 To feel good about yourself.
00:18:37 Dude, you haven't gotten addicted to the use, man.
00:18:40 They don't know who you are, though.
00:18:42 Yeah.
00:18:43 But it doesn't, you're a person on the internet.
00:18:45 Well, that's what you have a 3x3 for.
00:18:47 You see, if you have a 3x3 that shows what your favorites are and you post it on 4chad
00:18:52 and it looks like you have great taste, then everyone will give you...
00:18:55 No, but Digi, you've created the opposite effects now when you were complaining about 3x3s
00:19:00 because now people are going to try and make 3x3s on purpose to get cred that aren't cred.
00:19:06 Because you...
00:19:08 You were complaining about too much.
00:19:10 3x3s became a fucking nightmare after I made that video.
00:19:13 Because now people are like, to get cred, I've got to talk about things that don't have cred.
00:19:17 Oh, shit.
00:19:18 On each of these sites, there's a different sort of internet currency.
00:19:24 And in the case of the 3x3s, there's a new currency which is like the Digi buck,
00:19:29 which is like, it's endorsed by the degree to which people are here.
00:19:33 Oh, god, I really never thought of it this way.
00:19:35 It's how I could trust any of them.
00:19:37 You can't trust any 3x3 again?
00:19:39 They've all been, they've all got ulterior motives, theoretically, so they cannot be trusted.
00:19:45 Well, I like to think the result of this is just that everyone is now willing to put kill or kill on their 3x3s.
00:19:51 I think that's the only major difference I've made and I think that's a proud thing to have done.
00:19:56 You know the worst thing about cred-fagging is when it backfires on people?
00:20:00 Like, I've seen people like on Twitter, they ask like, where should I start with JoJo?
00:20:05 And then someone in the comments will be like, that's the one.
00:20:08 That's the one I was trying to think of.
00:20:09 People always ask what they can skip when they're reading fucking JoJo.
00:20:12 Read the whole thing, you piece of shit.
00:20:14 They're like, but that's the thing.
00:20:16 Being a cred-fag can get you into trouble because then you can get replies from like, just like,
00:20:20 dunderheads who are like, start with part 3.
00:20:22 Part 3 is the best, because it has the radio.
00:20:25 Part 2 is objectively superior to part 3 people.
00:20:29 Accept it.
00:20:30 Accept it.
00:20:31 Well, that's the funny thing about JoJo is like, everyone seems to have their favorite part
00:20:35 and like, people talk about which ones are the best.
00:20:37 Personally, I think JoJo is always like, the same.
00:20:42 Like, there are differences in each arc, but the tone of the series is always the exact same.
00:20:48 It's always over the top, scatological, insane, you know.
00:20:53 I'm a JoJo savant expert, super empowered, brilliant man.
00:20:57 And I can tell you that when people are making that argument, what they're really talking about
00:21:00 are the characters and like, the specific stands and as well as the general slight difference in tone.
00:21:06 Like, part 4 is like, a slice of life with stands.
00:21:09 And that's really fun, which is why it's one of the better parts.
00:21:12 But it's also like, I mean, I don't think it's that, like in terms of what's going on moment to moment.
00:21:17 It's not that different from every other JoJo's.
00:21:20 That's entirely true.
00:21:21 If the tone is the same the whole time, that's all the more reason to start at the beginning
00:21:24 because it's not going to get a super different experience if you start at part 4 or part 3 or whatever.
00:21:29 But you see, that cuts to the nature of what crowd fagging is, which is,
00:21:32 they just want to get to the stuff that's most commonly discussed
00:21:35 so they can be a part of the conversation as quickly as possible.
00:21:38 I think the worst example I've ever seen is Link.
00:21:41 Hayden sent me to NeoGaff of some guy who played Dark Souls.
00:21:44 Do you want to explain it, Hayden?
00:21:46 I don't remember this.
00:21:47 Oh, you don't remember?
00:21:48 It was like, he's like, I've played Dark Souls and I've been told that a lot of the...
00:21:53 This is a NeoGaff Fred, so of course it's gonna be like,
00:21:55 I've heard that all these designs are from Berserk.
00:21:58 Tell me.
00:21:59 Oh yeah.
00:22:00 Which parts of the Berserk manga can I skip?
00:22:04 Oh my god!
00:22:06 Oh no!
00:22:08 Just to see the references.
00:22:10 The fucking Berserk manga.
00:22:12 Just read the whole thing.
00:22:14 Why would you do this?
00:22:15 The man doesn't want to get triggered obviously, which is understandable.
00:22:18 I mean, I kind of, like when something is broken up into parts,
00:22:22 it's a little easier to understand, right?
00:22:25 You got, you know, okay, there's the first game, the second game,
00:22:28 maybe they had different staff behind them,
00:22:30 maybe they're not quite the same type of game.
00:22:32 The Berserk manga is just one ongoing manga.
00:22:35 There's no like, you know, it's not like Gunsmith Cats
00:22:38 where there's like Gunsmith Cats and Gunsmith Cats Burst, you know,
00:22:41 like there's two different...
00:22:42 No, it's just all Berserk!
00:22:43 Why would you think it's okay to skip any of it?
00:22:46 And you know, I gotta tell you, the thing that I,
00:22:48 since we're talking about examples of this that infuriate us,
00:22:51 the one that really sticks out to me is people in all seriousness
00:22:55 will just, I don't know how they do it,
00:22:57 but they will just jump into reading one piece.
00:23:00 Like, and a lot of it happened during the giant war in the middle of the series
00:23:05 where all the characters were coming together throughout the series
00:23:08 to like, do something, and these people,
00:23:11 there is no way they could have known what the fuck was going on,
00:23:14 who any of these people were, what the stakes were.
00:23:17 Everything in one piece builds on itself because it's a story,
00:23:20 it's a continuous linear story.
00:23:22 No, it's just all all so random.
00:23:24 To me, to me, like, it excites me.
00:23:27 If I start something good from the beginning
00:23:29 and I know there's like hundreds and hundreds,
00:23:31 like loads of content coming up,
00:23:33 does that excite me?
00:23:34 I'm like, oh shit, I'm not like,
00:23:36 well, you see, I don't know who the characters are in Opening 14,
00:23:40 which I watched on YouTube, so I'm just going to skip to that part.
00:23:42 It's like, no.
00:23:43 It's like, I want to go on the journey, man.
00:23:45 I want to go on the journey.
00:23:46 The only argument I can even kind of accept is that like,
00:23:49 my life is too busy, I don't have time to do all this.
00:23:52 Like, it's not a good argument.
00:23:53 Like, you're being a cred-fag when you do that,
00:23:55 but it's like, I get it.
00:23:56 Well, here's the thing.
00:23:57 Here's another thing.
00:23:58 I think a big part of this is also that all four of us are
00:24:03 analytically minded YouTube journalists of a sort
00:24:09 about these mediums, right?
00:24:11 Right.
00:24:12 And I think the way that we, because how do I put this?
00:24:15 None of us give a fuck what's current and new,
00:24:18 and I think this really reflects,
00:24:20 because I've been following Hayden and Charlie here
00:24:23 for over three years on YouTube,
00:24:26 and neither one of them has-
00:24:27 I haven't been following myself that long.
00:24:30 Neither one of them has ever really been someone
00:24:33 who makes videos about new games,
00:24:35 unless those are games that are, like,
00:24:37 really relevant to the franchises that they talk about.
00:24:40 You guys have made a couple Uncharted 4 and, like,
00:24:43 DMC videos, but, like, you didn't cover fucking
00:24:46 BioShock Infinite when it came out, you know,
00:24:49 or, like, the last of us in any depth.
00:24:51 And even in that brilliant Metal Gear Solid 5 video
00:24:54 by our friend the Gaming Brick here,
00:24:55 a lot of that was about the context of the entire series
00:24:58 and why it, you know, it's legacy stuff, you know?
00:25:00 But these are guys who go back and do fucking
00:25:02 a bunch of Devil May Cry videos
00:25:04 at a time when, you know, like-
00:25:06 Bayonetta's the new thing.
00:25:07 No one would be talking about it, yeah.
00:25:09 Or just anything, you know, they talk about older games.
00:25:11 I go back, I talk about tons of older anime.
00:25:13 Nate, you've only so far covered shit that,
00:25:16 well, I don't know.
00:25:17 You did Monster Musume.
00:25:18 I did Monster Musume, that's the one.
00:25:19 I got one.
00:25:20 Oh, yeah, that's true.
00:25:21 Oh, yeah, and One Punch Man.
00:25:22 Well, that doesn't apply to you at all.
00:25:23 It was a little late on One Punch Man, but, like-
00:25:25 Ah, fuck you.
00:25:27 But the point is that we're the kind of people who,
00:25:30 I think we care about history and we care about classics
00:25:34 and we care about going back and finding the best stuff
00:25:37 of the medium, and I think that a lot of these credit fags,
00:25:40 all they care about, like Charlie said,
00:25:42 is being a part of the conversation.
00:25:44 It's all about, like-
00:25:45 They care about being in on the meme.
00:25:46 That's what it's about.
00:25:47 They see something trending on Twitter
00:25:48 and they want to, as quickly as possible, get it.
00:25:51 Whereas I see something trending on Twitter
00:25:53 and I'm like, I don't fucking care.
00:25:55 I'll get to it when I get to it.
00:25:57 If everyone's talking about, like, Metal Gear Solid 5,
00:26:03 I don't run out and go, I need to play Metal Gear Solid 5
00:26:06 so I understand what everyone's saying.
00:26:08 I'm like, one day I'll play all the Metal Gear Solid games
00:26:11 if I get around to it, and then I can know all the memes.
00:26:15 But I don't-
00:26:16 I mean, no hurry, because I'd rather-
00:26:18 I would much rather know the entire story
00:26:21 than know a part of it so that I can be-
00:26:23 So I can spit memes for the two weeks that the game is relevant
00:26:26 and then immediately fades into-
00:26:29 You can't play MGS5 and then just pretend to be mad
00:26:32 about the things they missed.
00:26:33 Right.
00:26:34 Yeah, yeah.
00:26:35 And you know, it's totally-
00:26:38 Oh god, I totally forgot what I was going to say.
00:26:40 God damn it.
00:26:41 And I think I satiate my desire to keep up with stuff
00:26:44 because I just watched tons and tons of analysis videos.
00:26:48 So I know a startling amount about Metal Gear Solid 5
00:26:52 because I watched, you know, I watched our good friend Jesse
00:26:56 play through like a lot of the game on the Blue Glow.
00:26:59 I watched Charlie's analysis of it.
00:27:02 Bunnyhop wrote a bunch of videos about it.
00:27:04 So like I get why everyone feels the way that they do.
00:27:07 And yeah, like Charlie said, like me jumping in now,
00:27:10 I would feel so much less than what Charlie felt.
00:27:14 You know, like watching his video, I understand,
00:27:17 okay, this is what the series veterans are feeling.
00:27:19 But if I play the game, I'm not going to feel those things.
00:27:22 I'm not going to feel anything.
00:27:23 I'm just going to be like, oh, it's a game.
00:27:25 You know, I don't know what the fuck-
00:27:27 I don't know what who these characters are,
00:27:29 who the fuck is Big Boss.
00:27:30 I don't know.
00:27:31 You know, I kind of think of it like,
00:27:33 I really do consider myself an educator, among other things.
00:27:38 And like, it's not like because someone came up with a new idea
00:27:43 that we like throw out the old one when it comes to like,
00:27:46 okay, your times tables, like those are fine,
00:27:48 but I've got like a new version,
00:27:50 and I'm going to teach everyone this.
00:27:52 It's like, you take the best ideas throughout history,
00:27:55 and that's really my interest,
00:27:57 is finding the things that are the best examples of what they do
00:28:00 and highlighting them so that we can improve them
00:28:03 and people can learn from them in various ways.
00:28:05 Well, you're talking about educating, Nate,
00:28:07 and the thing is never give the cred fag any leeway
00:28:10 just because you want somebody to be into something you like.
00:28:14 Because even in that Berserk example I gave you,
00:28:16 there were people with Berserk avatars in that post saying,
00:28:18 well, I guess you can skip this part of the thing.
00:28:21 It's like, no.
00:28:22 Oh, no.
00:28:23 Never give anyone else.
00:28:24 People just go with Yakuza saying,
00:28:26 yeah, you know, you can skip to three.
00:28:27 There are recaps of the first two games.
00:28:29 You don't need to watch them.
00:28:30 You know, you can just read a fucking Wikipedia article
00:28:32 about them and know the story.
00:28:34 It's like, that's the worst part.
00:28:35 It's like, each one of these games has its own story
00:28:37 and like, twists and...
00:28:39 And it's a real shame with Yakuza,
00:28:41 because like two is so good.
00:28:43 It's like, it's such a fun game.
00:28:45 Two is like the best story in the entire series.
00:28:48 After two, the entire storyline for each one of the games
00:28:51 fucking takes a huge dip.
00:28:53 But you know, I'm with you on this,
00:28:55 but just to play Devil's Advocate,
00:28:56 I do understand people's urgent desire.
00:29:00 It really ties back to the human desire to be loved
00:29:02 and be in a community.
00:29:03 They want to be in on the thing that everyone's talking about.
00:29:06 So there's a desperation to know,
00:29:09 the game of Thrones is talking about Game of Thrones,
00:29:11 which has happened to a lot of people out there.
00:29:13 It's like, oh man, I want to be in.
00:29:16 I want to know.
00:29:17 And so a lot of people, just out of sheer,
00:29:19 this is pretty philosophical now,
00:29:20 out of a sheer desire to be loved
00:29:22 and to be a member of the human species,
00:29:24 they will do, they will, as soon as possible,
00:29:27 cut to the chase of understanding the idea
00:29:30 that is, you know, caught on with the people they know
00:29:33 in their lives.
00:29:34 Well, guess what, bitch?
00:29:35 I'll never love you if you don't.
00:29:37 I think with video games, though,
00:29:39 there's this whole technology element where it's like,
00:29:42 I don't want to play on those old systems.
00:29:44 Me and Hayden talk about this all the time,
00:29:46 and it's the fact that, oh, that PS2
00:29:49 has this icky vibe to it.
00:29:51 I want the HD thing.
00:29:53 That's some bullshit, because the PS2
00:29:55 does not give me icky vibes.
00:29:57 Playing shit on the PS3 gives me icky vibes,
00:30:00 because it's just fucking all the games run like ass.
00:30:03 Yeah.
00:30:05 And it's the same for, like, you know,
00:30:07 old anime or something, like, the animation.
00:30:10 Oh, man.
00:30:11 And it's four by three.
00:30:13 Yeah, yeah.
00:30:15 There was another NeoGaff thread where it was like,
00:30:18 Hayden said, it was like,
00:30:20 when Yakuza 5 was getting localized and some guy was like,
00:30:23 well, if it's not on PS3, like, he owned a PS3,
00:30:25 but he was like, yeah, you're exciting, Hayden.
00:30:27 I already packed my PS3 up into the attic.
00:30:30 I ain't getting it back down.
00:30:32 Hello.
00:30:35 I've seen a lot of stuff like that.
00:30:38 But that's the real shit, dude.
00:30:40 Those are the real reasons people use to, like,
00:30:42 dismiss works of art or whatever,
00:30:44 because they don't want to fucking unpack their old TV or whatever.
00:30:46 That's always been funny to me, because, you know,
00:30:48 people talk about, like, backwards compatibility,
00:30:50 and I think that...
00:30:52 I think all these consoles should have it.
00:30:54 But it's always been really funny to me that people make,
00:30:56 like, such a huge deal about it,
00:30:58 because I still have all my consoles, you know?
00:31:01 Now, I wish I didn't have to, like,
00:31:03 when I went out to buy Yakuza as a result of Hayden's video,
00:31:07 I was sans PS2,
00:31:10 because seven of them have broken on me over the years,
00:31:13 so I had to go buy a new one,
00:31:15 but it was, like, $25, you know?
00:31:17 And it would have been nice
00:31:19 if I could have just popped that fucking disc into my PS4,
00:31:22 my fucking supercomputer sitting on my desk,
00:31:25 but whatever, you know?
00:31:28 This idea that you, like, have to pack away your old consoles
00:31:31 and never touch them again,
00:31:33 it just reeks of not giving a fuck about history
00:31:36 and old games and being, like, I'm never going back,
00:31:38 I'm never playing something old.
00:31:40 I do think the companies that make these things
00:31:42 should play a role in preserving that
00:31:44 with the backwards compatibility, though.
00:31:46 I agree, I agree.
00:31:48 But here's the thing, those people don't have those consoles,
00:31:50 because they're the ultimate cred fags,
00:31:52 and they didn't play games until recently.
00:31:54 Oh!
00:31:56 They were young for what it's worth.
00:31:58 They were fucking young.
00:32:00 But those old consoles, like I said, are fucking cheap.
00:32:02 I went out and bought, like, I literally went to,
00:32:04 I was at a used game store,
00:32:06 and it's like, oh, there's Yakuza, and there's a PS2,
00:32:08 and this is less than $50 combined, you know?
00:32:11 I mean, I guess if you're 10, that's a lot,
00:32:13 but that's less than what a new game would have cost.
00:32:16 A whole console and a great game for that console
00:32:19 was less than buying one shitty new fucking $60 game.
00:32:25 But I think this is particularly bad in gaming,
00:32:31 which is probably why we're using so many gaming examples,
00:32:34 and there's a great article that I read this one time
00:32:37 that I wish I could remember what it's called,
00:32:39 because I cite it all the time,
00:32:41 but there's this guy who was a professor
00:32:43 teaching game design at a college,
00:32:45 and he decided to run a little experiment
00:32:47 where he asked everybody in the crowd,
00:32:49 who hears the fan of the Elder Scrolls games,
00:32:52 and like 80% of the class raised their hand,
00:32:55 and he said, who all has played Skyrim
00:32:57 and all those hand-staters?
00:32:58 Oh, yeah.
00:32:59 Then he said, who's all has played Oblivion,
00:33:02 and like more than half of the hands went down,
00:33:05 and then he says, who's played Morrowind,
00:33:07 and it's like two guys left,
00:33:09 and then he's like, who's played Daggerfall?
00:33:11 Nobody, right?
00:33:12 And he's like, you know,
00:33:14 you say you're a fan of the Elder Scrolls,
00:33:17 but you're really a fan of Skyrim,
00:33:19 and you clearly have no context of the history
00:33:22 of this franchise, and it's like,
00:33:24 it's so weird that people seem to think,
00:33:27 especially when it comes to games,
00:33:29 that the newest one is just the best one,
00:33:32 just because it's the newest,
00:33:34 and they have no interest in looking back
00:33:36 and finding out if there's anything different
00:33:38 or interesting or better about the old games,
00:33:40 which in something like the Elder Scrolls,
00:33:42 a lot of people consider Morrowind the best one,
00:33:45 and these people will never know.
00:33:48 The advantages of that one,
00:33:50 because it doesn't look new like Skyrim.
00:33:52 I'm so glad you got to this point,
00:33:54 because at least for me, and maybe not everybody agrees,
00:33:57 because not everybody sees games the way I
00:33:59 and possibly the rest of you do,
00:34:01 it is not about the most polished presentation,
00:34:05 what matters about all art
00:34:07 is the density of valuable ideas,
00:34:11 and the density of artistic merit,
00:34:13 and that is what it's about,
00:34:15 and that's why a game that looks like,
00:34:17 just for example Final Fantasy VII,
00:34:19 it looks pretty ass, is so widely loved,
00:34:22 because it is so much density.
00:34:24 Don't say it looks ass, it has dated graphics.
00:34:26 I don't even agree with that.
00:34:28 The graphical design is fantastic,
00:34:30 it's just that it has dated graphics,
00:34:33 but that doesn't...
00:34:35 I think that that game looks better
00:34:37 than most modern games with state-of-the-art graphics,
00:34:40 because the art design is great.
00:34:43 You're shaming me, you're schooling me on my own game.
00:34:46 Let's not even get started on stuff like Silent Hill 2,
00:34:49 and 3 and stuff that look amazing on PS2,
00:34:52 and now the updates come along,
00:34:55 and that's the version I have to play,
00:34:57 because I don't want to PS2.
00:34:59 If you guys have seen the amazing videos
00:35:01 by the real Silent Hill experience,
00:35:04 the real Silent Hill experience by Twin Perfect,
00:35:06 the way that they so clearly lay out the case,
00:35:08 that in Silent Hill 3, for example,
00:35:10 every room had unique assets
00:35:13 that were specifically constructed
00:35:15 to evoke a specific scare and emotion for that room,
00:35:17 versus in downpour,
00:35:19 it's like the same fucking desk with pencil and paper
00:35:22 in the exact same location,
00:35:24 like a thousand times in an empty world
00:35:26 where there's nothing to do,
00:35:28 and not even random spawning monsters.
00:35:30 That's the difference between creating a piece of art
00:35:32 and creating a product, like downpour.
00:35:34 That's right.
00:35:36 But it's the newest one, so I gotta skip to it.
00:35:38 The gaming press perpetuates this,
00:35:41 and not just in the whole buy-the-new-game thing,
00:35:43 in the whole recent trend of people going,
00:35:46 finally, games are getting good.
00:35:49 And I'm not saying there aren't great games at the moment,
00:35:53 but there's this culture that...
00:35:56 Yeah, the whole Citizen Kane game
00:35:58 has become legitimized only recently.
00:36:00 Everyone was retarded before no one
00:36:03 you had to make a game for the PS3.
00:36:05 The fucked up part is in any other medium,
00:36:09 I feel like you would get laughed out of a room
00:36:12 if you tried to be a critic who hasn't seen the classics.
00:36:15 If you're a film critic,
00:36:17 and you haven't seen Citizen Kane,
00:36:20 then people are gonna be like,
00:36:22 what the fuck are you doing?
00:36:24 Why have you not seen the Godfather?
00:36:27 I've never seen the Godfather,
00:36:29 but I'm gonna review a gangster movie.
00:36:31 People are gonna be like, why would you ever do that?
00:36:34 You clearly have no context into what gangster movies are,
00:36:37 because you haven't seen what is considered
00:36:39 by many to be the greatest film of all time.
00:36:41 Did you? All old games are problematic,
00:36:43 so there's no reason to go back and watch them.
00:36:45 You know, guys, the real question I have here
00:36:48 is why are schools wasting our time teaching our kids
00:36:52 with these old-ass books for grandpas?
00:36:55 You know, like, Catcher of the Rye is a million years old.
00:36:58 Let's move on. We've got, you know...
00:37:00 Yeah, we got the right to.
00:37:02 We read an old book like Catcher of the Rye.
00:37:05 You know, Crime and Punishment was great.
00:37:07 Crime and Punishment was great, but we've got a new version.
00:37:09 It's called Death Note. It's better in every way.
00:37:11 Let's just all read Death Note instead.
00:37:14 It is replaced. It is superseded in artistic merit in every way.
00:37:18 That's what I'm saying.
00:37:20 People were fucking Neanderthals until recently,
00:37:22 when we got iPhones.
00:37:24 There's something so, like, sad to me
00:37:28 about the idea that we have, like, so much gaming criticism,
00:37:31 and none of it's looking back.
00:37:33 And, like...
00:37:35 You know, I've made this point before,
00:37:37 and Endless Jess had a great video
00:37:39 called Fuck the Citizen Kane of Gaming,
00:37:41 and both of us were kind of making the point that, like...
00:37:43 If there's a Citizen Kane of Gaming,
00:37:46 it's fucking Super Mario Brothers.
00:37:48 You know, like, that's a classic game.
00:37:50 Every element of it is amazing.
00:37:52 You know, it still holds up to this day.
00:37:54 People still play it.
00:37:56 It's been beloved for decades by people around the world.
00:38:00 How is that not, like, an impeccable classic game?
00:38:03 And how can you really, like, talk about games as a medium
00:38:07 without knowing about it, you know?
00:38:09 I agree. I completely agree with that.
00:38:11 It's the Gazomp-Gazverk, or whatever that word was.
00:38:14 Yeah, Gazomp. I'm not gonna try.
00:38:16 Watch that video by Mr. Beaton. That's the one.
00:38:20 Yeah.
00:38:21 Like, I find that this is just me personally,
00:38:24 but...
00:38:25 And, like, I'm becoming, like...
00:38:28 I guess maybe this even makes me, like, a cred-fag,
00:38:31 but it's, like, I find that, at least with me,
00:38:34 just in terms of this Citizen of Gaming as Super Mario Brothers thing,
00:38:38 I find, like, a lot of people love in America, like, Tatari,
00:38:41 and a lot of people in Britain, like, ZX Spectrum and stuff,
00:38:43 but, like, it feels like, to me...
00:38:45 To what?
00:38:46 The modern video game began with Super Mario Brothers.
00:38:49 Like, if you think about it, like, that's the point to me
00:38:51 where I'm like, damn, games got good.
00:38:53 Like, finally, you know, that's how I feel, at least.
00:38:55 Did any of you guys even beat the original Super Mario Bros?
00:38:58 Or am I hanging out with a bunch of cr-
00:39:00 I have.
00:39:01 I have.
00:39:02 I beat it on Game Boy in, like, the third grade.
00:39:04 I remember doing it well.
00:39:05 Dude, World 8 is no joke.
00:39:07 Like, World 8 is no joke.
00:39:08 That's a hard game, dude.
00:39:09 I have beaten Super Mario Brothers by use of save states.
00:39:13 Yeah, alright.
00:39:14 And by which I mean...
00:39:16 By which I mean, I save state after every jump.
00:39:19 Every jump.
00:39:20 Yeah.
00:39:21 That's how I got through that game.
00:39:23 Dude, yo, this neg over here maps save and reload save state
00:39:27 to the X and Y of his controller when he's playing.
00:39:29 You just don't know when you're going to run into a credit flag.
00:39:31 It's like every...
00:39:33 No, I said...
00:39:34 That game is fucking hard.
00:39:36 It's hard.
00:39:37 It's hard.
00:39:38 It's true.
00:39:39 And it's hard in a way that's in fear.
00:39:40 Like, the thing is, I mean, there's an extent to which I'm like,
00:39:43 alright, you have to see everything in order to talk about stuff.
00:39:46 But there's also an extent to which it's like,
00:39:48 I'm not going to play a game I hate, you know.
00:39:50 Yeah, yeah.
00:39:51 Mario Bros. is not my type of game.
00:39:53 Like, it's...
00:39:54 The fucking live system alone is enough to make me not want to play it.
00:39:57 It's designed to be played forever and it's like,
00:40:01 I now live in a world where there's a thousand games I could be playing
00:40:05 as opposed to one that was the one that came with my console
00:40:09 when I was eight and I had all the time in the world.
00:40:12 And I feel like Mario Bros. is a lot easier to play through
00:40:15 in that circumstance as opposed to, like, getting frustrated
00:40:19 and knowing that I could put it down and go do anything else, you know.
00:40:23 Yeah.
00:40:24 I say, like, saying that Super Mario Bros. is like,
00:40:27 where I think games got good makes me a cred fag
00:40:29 because now it's like, hey man, you didn't play Atari.
00:40:31 You don't know what it's like.
00:40:32 You can't appreciate Mario Bros.
00:40:34 Oh, yeah.
00:40:35 Well, you know, like, the distinction between the modern era of video games.
00:40:39 That's true.
00:40:40 I'm just distinguishing errors.
00:40:41 I will say, I feel like a cred fag now
00:40:43 because of the fact that I have always looked,
00:40:45 like, there's certain Atari games.
00:40:47 Like, Adventure is considered to be, like, the first, like,
00:40:51 adventure game, first RPG.
00:40:53 And, like, I always see it on lists of, like, the best ever
00:40:56 just because it's the first, so people feel the need to list it.
00:40:59 But I always look at it and I'm like, yeah, but it looks like shit.
00:41:02 So, obviously, who cares.
00:41:05 But then it's like, well, I haven't actually played it.
00:41:07 What if it's actually really great, you know, for reasons
00:41:10 I couldn't possibly foresee by looking at the graphics.
00:41:13 That's like the grand scheme of the medium, though.
00:41:15 Obviously, if you're looking at a franchise or a series,
00:41:18 like, isolated from the rest, it's like, obviously,
00:41:21 if you're skipping around, then obviously, you know.
00:41:24 It's tough, man.
00:41:25 You've gone full cred on that one.
00:41:28 But, you know, really, we should, like, we're all in the spectrum.
00:41:31 We're all in the cred fag spectrum.
00:41:33 We're all in the cred fag spectrum.
00:41:35 I haven't played, I haven't beaten Sound Hill 1,
00:41:38 but I absolutely love Sound Hill 2 and 3.
00:41:40 Maybe I'll get to 4 someday.
00:41:42 And, you know, I feel a little bad about that,
00:41:44 that I played 3 without playing 1, so I don't have, like, all the content.
00:41:46 But, you know, you only have so many hours in a day, you know.
00:41:49 I'll do it someday.
00:41:50 I want to play.
00:41:51 If I had to put up an argument to people who are, like, you know,
00:41:53 who never go back and who, like, just look at them as, like, old games,
00:41:56 it's like, dude, if they're made a franchise out of it,
00:41:58 chances are the first game was great.
00:42:00 Like, there's got to be a reason people liked it enough
00:42:03 that they could afford to make another one, right?
00:42:05 That's a good argument.
00:42:06 The reason these, like, I mean, people will say, like,
00:42:09 well, okay, but the technology's gotten better, but we've built on it.
00:42:12 But, yeah, but at the same time, those old games have,
00:42:15 they have an art to them.
00:42:17 It's not just about the technology.
00:42:19 And, like, you know, I went back a couple years ago and played Zelda 1,
00:42:24 and I thought it was fucking phenomenal.
00:42:26 And it's a style of game, no other Zelda game has been.
00:42:29 You know, they've all sort of, none of them have that same free form,
00:42:33 roaming, just exploring, having to find everything for yourself.
00:42:36 And, like, if you just look at a picture of Zelda 1,
00:42:39 it just looks like, eh, but the graphics are,
00:42:41 how am I ever going to feel a sense of adventure?
00:42:43 I had a similar experience with that,
00:42:45 because, like, I remember playing Zelda 1 when I was a kid,
00:42:47 and I was like, oh.
00:42:49 But then, like, I played it, like, recently, again, I'm like,
00:42:51 this is amazing.
00:42:52 Like, this is, like, open-ended.
00:42:54 People out there deeply misunderstand, you know,
00:42:58 it's just what we were saying before.
00:43:00 Yeah, they don't appreciate the way that it is the sum total of the parts
00:43:04 of a game that determined the quality,
00:43:06 which is why, you know, we've talked about this before,
00:43:08 like, they can show us all these previews for a game like Final Fantasy XV,
00:43:12 but ultimately, what do we really know,
00:43:14 not a heck of a lot about how it's going to be as a whole game,
00:43:17 which is what ultimately matters in the end, you know?
00:43:20 And, like, my brother, Victor, like, again, Ultimate Cred-Fag,
00:43:24 like, he's a huge die-hard Zelda fan, you know,
00:43:26 and we both got into Zelda through Ocarina of Time.
00:43:29 What is his title now? He's the Ultimate Cred-Fag?
00:43:31 Right.
00:43:32 He's going to listen to this, too.
00:43:34 He will.
00:43:35 But we both got into Zelda with Ocarina of Time,
00:43:38 and, like, you know, he's played all the other ones since then,
00:43:42 whether it's 2D or 3D,
00:43:44 he's played all the ones since Ocarina of Time,
00:43:46 but he's never gone back and played Zelda 1,
00:43:50 and he's barely played a Link to the Past, if at all.
00:43:53 And, like, to him, it's like he sees it as, yeah,
00:43:56 like, for me, Zelda is all about the big, the feeling of scale
00:44:00 and the bigness, you know, his favorite one's Twilight Princess,
00:44:03 because it looks epic.
00:44:04 And I'm like, yeah, but if you actually played Zelda 1,
00:44:07 what you'll find is that the graphics, that fades away,
00:44:11 and mechanically, you feel like you're on an epic adventure
00:44:15 because you have to find everything yourself.
00:44:18 And it's such an interesting feeling to, like, learn this map
00:44:22 to go back and forth to all these locations
00:44:24 and figure things out that, eventually,
00:44:26 it feels like an epic adventure,
00:44:28 and you can't get that through screen caps, you know?
00:44:32 I do sympathize with his position, just in the sense that it sounds like
00:44:36 he doesn't really experience what you're talking about.
00:44:39 Like, he's not really familiar with that particular motion.
00:44:41 But he has no idea, because he hasn't played Zelda 1, you know?
00:44:44 Well, sure.
00:44:45 That's an experience he hasn't had yet, maybe.
00:44:47 I'm not trying to show you, Victor, but he hasn't had it,
00:44:50 so if he had experienced it, that would open his mind to other things
00:44:54 that he can experience, but I get his argument.
00:44:57 It logically makes sense from his perspective,
00:44:59 but obviously, you know, there's more out there.
00:45:01 I think that there's an extent to which we've been playing these games,
00:45:04 like, we'll play these Zelda games on DigiBros,
00:45:06 and he never wants to play an older one,
00:45:08 because he's like, it won't, you know,
00:45:10 I'm just going to get bored, I'm going to zone out and stuff,
00:45:12 and I'm like, well, okay, I don't think we should play any of them first on there.
00:45:15 I don't think your first experience with the game should ever be on Let's Play Show.
00:45:19 Yeah, I agree.
00:45:21 If he sat down and played Zelda 1, I think he'd like it,
00:45:25 and I think you have to be willing to try, you know?
00:45:30 That's true.
00:45:31 I mean, if you're going to consider yourself a huge Zelda fan, why would you not?
00:45:36 Why would you not go back and do Zelda 1, you know?
00:45:38 Do you want to, every time that you say you're a huge Zelda fan,
00:45:41 Victor, put that little asterisk there, like,
00:45:43 oh, but I haven't played any of them before, link to the fucking Ocarina Time, you know?
00:45:47 Yeah, me and Hayden were actually talking about how Zelda is like the biggest
00:45:51 Kred Fag series of all time.
00:45:54 That's true.
00:45:56 It's got such like fake, complex lore, you know what I mean?
00:46:00 Yeah, like the timeline.
00:46:02 There really is no lore, it's just stuff they made up in the game,
00:46:05 but it's like, yo man, the timeline, like, it blows my mind when I see people talking about it.
00:46:10 I don't know why, people's investment in the timeline baffles me,
00:46:14 because it doesn't matter at all.
00:46:16 It has no narrative importance.
00:46:18 I find it so crazy when new Zelda gets shown,
00:46:20 and people are trying to decipher where it takes place in the timeline.
00:46:23 It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter!
00:46:26 It makes literally zero narrative difference.
00:46:29 The people who make the games literally gave you a timeline,
00:46:32 because you wanted a timeline, not because there was a timeline,
00:46:35 they made one up, because...
00:46:37 I'm sure they only came up with that as of Skyward Sword.
00:46:40 Right, but that's the thing, like, bringing it back to what we first said,
00:46:43 like, playing a series in release order,
00:46:45 like, where you're talking about how he doesn't want to go back and play the original Zelda's,
00:46:48 because they're not as epic as the new ones.
00:46:50 That's the problem, that's why I don't want people to go and play the more recent games,
00:46:54 because then it makes the original games,
00:46:57 which had the original ideas, which came up with these mechanics,
00:47:00 which started this all, which eventually led up to this game you love,
00:47:06 you know, like, that now looks like a piece of shit,
00:47:10 because now it's been topped by its sequels.
00:47:14 But I guess if you play it in release order,
00:47:17 you're going to be like, that was awesome, then play the next one, that was awesome!
00:47:20 Right, and that's such another great advantage to playing things in release order,
00:47:23 as you can see the progression of things,
00:47:25 and even if they're negative, ultimately,
00:47:27 like, to go, I think a lot of people who just blindly transitioned from pixels to 3D,
00:47:32 you know, there was obviously some sloppy shit going on there for a while.
00:47:36 It's interesting to see that.
00:47:37 I love it, because especially in games,
00:47:39 like, I feel like more than any other medium,
00:47:41 it's like you play a game on one console,
00:47:44 and then like years later, you jump to the next game,
00:47:46 and it's like the world looks different, you know, the characters look different.
00:47:51 You're experiencing this upgrade, because it's like,
00:47:54 it's like you're now seeing the vision of the creators
00:47:57 for a new lens of what they can now do, what they wanted it to originally look like.
00:48:02 That's what's so exciting about Yakuza 6,
00:48:05 that's what's so exciting about it.
00:48:07 And don't go thinking people that that means like,
00:48:09 oh, that means actually just play the lace one,
00:48:11 because it's the closest to their artistic vision.
00:48:12 No, that's not how it works.
00:48:15 You know, I want to speak directly to CredFags,
00:48:19 because I have two pieces of advice.
00:48:21 My first piece, because you all know who you are,
00:48:24 if you've been listening to this, you figure it out.
00:48:27 Two pieces of advice.
00:48:30 One, try them all even if you don't necessarily beat them.
00:48:36 Like you don't have to, like if you go back to Elder Scrolls,
00:48:40 like each one is unique and has its own pieces of intrigue.
00:48:45 If you start up Daggerfall and you immediately want to vomit, as I do,
00:48:49 because the way that the perspective is and the way,
00:48:53 not just that the graphics aren't good,
00:48:55 but that the way they're presented is like nauseating,
00:48:58 in a way that only a 90s first-person PC game could be.
00:49:03 Fine, at least give it a shot.
00:49:05 I mean, some of you might play it and realize,
00:49:08 hey, these graphics don't nauseate me at all.
00:49:10 Here's what you'll get out of it.
00:49:12 Daggerfall has the biggest map in any video game ever.
00:49:17 People talk about Skyrim has a huge map, right?
00:49:20 Skyrim has a six...
00:49:22 It's the size of Great Britain in Daggerfall, isn't it?
00:49:24 Yes, Daggerfall is actually larger than Great Britain.
00:49:28 To put that into perspective, Skyrim is about 16 square miles in size,
00:49:33 and Daggerfall is like 20,000 square miles or something like that.
00:49:38 Oh my God.
00:49:39 Well, games have just gotten better and better, guys.
00:49:42 Only today have they finally achieved that.
00:49:44 Well, look at these technological wonders we've got now
00:49:46 that can make such huge maps.
00:49:48 Fuck yourself, people.
00:49:49 I believe it's procedurally generated, I think.
00:49:52 But I think it might be in the same way as...
00:49:56 What's it called?
00:49:58 Oblivion, where oblivion was a procedurally generated map
00:50:03 that was then solidified and they put it in the game.
00:50:06 But oblivion was like 10 square miles or something like that.
00:50:10 Daggerfall is fucking massive.
00:50:12 So if that sounds interesting to you,
00:50:14 then if you play the game and then you find that out,
00:50:17 then there might be someone who starts off thinking,
00:50:19 well, this isn't going to be as good as Skyrim,
00:50:21 but then you find out that there's something so unique about it
00:50:24 that it ends up actually being your favorite one.
00:50:27 It's like such a fallacy that the newer stuff is better,
00:50:33 because it's like, oh man, when assets were more simple
00:50:37 and they didn't take as long to make and it wasn't as expensive,
00:50:40 we could make more game.
00:50:42 And now we can't.
00:50:44 You see so many sequels that are like,
00:50:46 we removed this feature and this feature and this feature,
00:50:48 because they didn't have time to do it.
00:50:50 And the real issue with this whole thing is that
00:50:53 it's a vicious cycle of, you know,
00:50:56 there is consumer, quote unquote, demand
00:50:59 for like higher resolution stuff as in the meme is
00:51:02 that it has to be, you know, like Square Enix's thing,
00:51:04 it has to be picture perfect,
00:51:06 like the best possible have to spend all the resources
00:51:09 making Lightning's tits move in a slightly more realistic way
00:51:12 than anything else.
00:51:14 And then the resources get diverted there
00:51:16 because there's this perceived demand for that
00:51:18 as opposed to artistic...
00:51:20 Well, part of the problem is fucking...
00:51:23 I think part of the problem is review scores.
00:51:26 Well, Lightning's tits, I mean, okay, we all want that.
00:51:29 Aside from that...
00:51:30 There's a lot of Japanese developers
00:51:32 who seem to perfectly understand this.
00:51:34 And when a new game comes out from like Nipponichi
00:51:37 or Falcom or like most of the things that are published by Atlas,
00:51:42 like those games tend to look old,
00:51:45 but they also tend to have way more content
00:51:48 than any newer games.
00:51:50 And you end up with a situation where like...
00:51:52 You can play Disgaea for literally forever,
00:51:54 as I recall.
00:51:55 Right, and they keep making new Disgaea
00:51:58 and they all look like Disgaea 1.
00:52:01 The textures are in HD now,
00:52:03 but they're still fucking the same pixel art drawings, right?
00:52:06 I think...
00:52:07 Oh, sorry, go on.
00:52:08 I think like, you know, those games are still as big as ever.
00:52:11 You can still play a new Disgaea for 80 to 300 hours, you know?
00:52:15 And I think that when these games get...
00:52:18 When you open up a game in former magazine,
00:52:20 the game they're going to give a 10 out of 10
00:52:23 is going to be the one, the BioShock Infinite,
00:52:26 the one that like looks beautiful
00:52:29 and looks like it's, you know, modern and cutting edge
00:52:32 and it seems to be saying something with its story, so...
00:52:35 10 out of 10, you know?
00:52:37 Like God of War 4, looking for that 10 out of 10.
00:52:40 So I think...
00:52:41 You've got Trails of...
00:52:43 Sorry, you've got like Trails of Cold Steel coming out
00:52:46 or something like that, which I haven't played this myself,
00:52:49 but like I've heard from our friend Mother's Basement,
00:52:52 like it's like one of his favorite games of all time.
00:52:54 And that game is like pixel art,
00:52:57 but it's like a huge, unbelievably massive world,
00:53:00 you know, with all these different moving parts.
00:53:02 Every NPC has a story and stuff
00:53:04 and there's side quests everywhere and like,
00:53:06 if that game, even if that game was perfect at what it wanted to do,
00:53:09 if you open up a Game Informer, that score will never be above an 8.5.
00:53:13 It will not happen because it doesn't look like a 10
00:53:16 and they won't give it a 10, you know?
00:53:18 And it's just all about the different standards
00:53:20 that they're using to judge versus guys like us?
00:53:22 Right.
00:53:23 They're only going to give the 10 to the big modern game.
00:53:26 I once went to like the library in my university
00:53:29 and they had like a bunch of old gaming magazines.
00:53:31 They had like reviews from like the 90s.
00:53:33 Ah, cool.
00:53:34 And they had like a big compilation of like loads of scores
00:53:36 they gave to games in like the end of the 90s.
00:53:39 And you won't believe it.
00:53:41 It's like, they like review like these polygon, like horrible messes.
00:53:46 Like, oh yes, Siphon, you know, I haven't played Siphon yet.
00:53:48 Maybe it's really good.
00:53:49 But it's like, oh, it's like this polygonal, like,
00:53:52 like terrible draw distance game, like 9 out of 10.
00:53:55 And then it's like, well, simply of the night,
00:53:58 it doesn't seem to really be pushing any boundaries here.
00:54:01 It just seems like a Super Nintendo game.
00:54:03 Nothing to see here.
00:54:04 Six out of 10.
00:54:05 And then it's like...
00:54:09 There's no X.
00:54:10 There's no X.
00:54:11 Yeah.
00:54:13 I do think the reviews have gotten slightly better,
00:54:15 because it used to be you'd read a review and it'd be like,
00:54:18 there'd be sections and it'd be like graphics,
00:54:20 five out of 10 gameplay.
00:54:22 And it's like, if the graphics weren't out of 10,
00:54:24 then it wouldn't be a 10.
00:54:25 It's like, at least now people are moving away a bit from scores
00:54:28 and that kind of rhetoric.
00:54:29 The thing is like, I've never read reviews.
00:54:32 I've never given a shit.
00:54:34 If there was ever a review, all I'd do is look at the pictures
00:54:37 and then be like...
00:54:40 Well, I grew up on reviews.
00:54:42 Like, how I got into doing this kind of writing
00:54:45 is that I would read like, Nintendo Power Magazine
00:54:47 and as a teenager, I read a lot of GameStop reviews
00:54:52 and I was always fascinated with the scores.
00:54:55 Because to me, growing up, it always seemed like
00:54:57 knowing what is the highest scored game
00:55:00 tells me what are the classics.
00:55:03 If I know that GameStop gave their highest score ever
00:55:06 to Metroid Prime for the longest time,
00:55:09 then I now need to go play Metroid Prime.
00:55:13 And when you find a reviewer who you really trust their scores,
00:55:17 then that can be really helpful.
00:55:19 Because I used to really trust...
00:55:22 Have I been saying stop? I meant spot. GameSpot.
00:55:25 I used to really trust the game in Britain, then he went to shit.
00:55:28 Well, you surely trust GameSpot because of the fact
00:55:31 that they were super strict with their scores.
00:55:33 They only gave the high scores to very rarely.
00:55:36 And so I always thought, cool, those must be the true classic games.
00:55:40 But then, over time, I realized that they fall into the same trap
00:55:43 everyone else does of if it's not new and modern
00:55:48 and a big fucking graphical powerhouse,
00:55:51 it's not going to get that 10.
00:55:52 Even if you make the best JRPG of all time,
00:55:55 it will not get a 10 because it's a JRPG.
00:55:58 The YouTube evolution of reviews is a really great thing,
00:56:02 and it's got positive and negatives,
00:56:03 but it's so great to really be able to get deep into like...
00:56:07 You don't have like one page to fill with text,
00:56:10 and that's all you get.
00:56:11 You can have a guy like, you know, a bunny hop
00:56:14 going into like the history and make a half an hour fucking video
00:56:18 about every little detail you could ever want to know
00:56:20 and why this game is an artistic masterpiece
00:56:22 for collecting all these various aspects
00:56:24 from all the different games in the series
00:56:26 and presenting them in this way
00:56:27 that will perfectly capture everything
00:56:29 that longtime fans of that series has wanted.
00:56:31 That's what's really valuable.
00:56:33 That's the kind of review that has real merit in the world.
00:56:36 Well, I think these journalists are like,
00:56:38 what the fuck?
00:56:39 I got to keep my finger on the pulse of the gaming landscape.
00:56:42 What am I doing wasting my time with this game
00:56:44 that looks like a fucking PS2 game or whatever, you know?
00:56:46 So they're like, fuck, just get it over with.
00:56:48 Yeah, whatever, 7.2.
00:56:51 They come in, I think it's like people who,
00:56:53 they jump in and then like, they just have to go,
00:56:56 because news happens fast, right?
00:56:59 I know a lot of anime fans who get into anime
00:57:02 because they saw one or two older shows
00:57:05 and then they start watching current stuff.
00:57:07 And if you're trying to keep up with current stuff consistently,
00:57:10 it can take up all your free time
00:57:12 because there's 45 fucking shows that come out each season.
00:57:15 And so I know a lot of people
00:57:17 who pretty much never watch older anime, you know?
00:57:21 I think Jeff somewhat falls into this trap
00:57:24 where like, I only ever hear Jeff talk about watching current shit, you know?
00:57:27 Kind of.
00:57:28 And like, to me, that stuff is,
00:57:31 like, because current anime lets you be a part of the conversation for now,
00:57:35 but what it doesn't do is give you perspective on what's been great, you know?
00:57:40 Like, if this current season that has just started,
00:57:44 there's not a single show on right now
00:57:46 that I like immediately think this is going to be talked about in five years,
00:57:50 you know, like, nothing gives me that impression,
00:57:52 whereas you can go watch a show that has been talked about for five years,
00:57:57 and now you're going to get like a new perspective on the history of the medium
00:58:00 and what, like, what highs it can reach and like, you know,
00:58:04 and that will enrich you for the future
00:58:06 when you actually want to talk about like, deeper shit.
00:58:09 You know, if you want to talk about a new game and be like,
00:58:11 this is how it reflects the state of gaming,
00:58:13 you need to know the state of gaming, you know?
00:58:16 Dude, that's really cool because in terms of games,
00:58:19 if you think back to like, from like just five years ago,
00:58:22 what are the games that have stood a test of time and are imitating now?
00:58:25 You think of stuff like Dark Souls,
00:58:27 which was like a low-budget JRPG made in like a million bucks
00:58:31 that like wasn't cutting edge, no one really knew about it,
00:58:34 had a small, had a slow sort of like, ascent into popularity,
00:58:39 and now that's the game everyone wants to be
00:58:41 and all the mechanics, loads of RPGs copy,
00:58:44 and that's why, and that's exactly why,
00:58:46 like just because the game is the prettiest and the most hype
00:58:49 doesn't mean it's going to be the most relevant.
00:58:51 That's a good point, man.
00:58:52 No one's going to fucking, no one's going to care about,
00:58:54 like, because that year, I think Dark Souls came out in 2011,
00:58:59 and so this would be before Bioshock Infinite and stuff,
00:59:03 but like, what would you say are some games from 2011
00:59:06 that were like big then, you know,
00:59:08 like Skyrim, Skyward Sword, Uncharted 3,
00:59:13 Deus Exe Revolution, Batman Arkham City,
00:59:17 does anyone still boot up Batman Arkham City, you know?
00:59:20 Right, baby.
00:59:21 Like, I think a game, I think a series like the Souls games,
00:59:24 like each one has been such a big deal that yeah,
00:59:27 it'll be talked about forever, it'll influence a million games,
00:59:30 there's been countless articles written on it,
00:59:32 it's studied in academia, you know.
00:59:34 You know what game came out in 2011?
00:59:36 Minecraft.
00:59:38 Oh, well that's, I mean, that is a big deal.
00:59:40 People are still talking about Dark Souls 1
00:59:42 more than they do fucking Dark Souls 2, Dark Souls 3,
00:59:45 or even Bloodborne.
00:59:46 I mean, I tried to, I was trying to like,
00:59:48 find something from 2011, but like,
00:59:50 even to use Bioshock Infinite from 2012 or 13,
00:59:54 it might have been 2012, now that I think about it.
00:59:56 I think it was 2012, I want to say.
00:59:58 That game was such a big deal when it came out,
01:00:00 and I don't think anyone cares anymore.
01:00:02 Like, no one goes back to play Bioshock Infinite again.
01:00:06 It's not going to be like...
01:00:08 Oh, thank God, yes, just waiting.
01:00:10 Like, you can buy that game for $5 at a bargain bin
01:00:14 at fucking GameStop, you know, but like,
01:00:16 that's a game that I don't think is going to have
01:00:19 nearly the cultural footprint that a Dark Souls has, you know.
01:00:23 It got exposed as the piece of shit it was right after it came out.
01:00:26 It got exposed quite a bit.
01:00:28 I think I saw someone link to an article the other day
01:00:30 where it was like, a reviewer for like,
01:00:32 Eurogame I think, taught like, he did an article on Bioshock
01:00:35 and I wasn't talking about how, man, I way overhyped this game.
01:00:37 I remember it today.
01:00:39 And now we're going to...
01:00:41 Every...
01:00:43 Does that mean...
01:00:45 Overhyped, yeah.
01:00:46 I think I get it.
01:00:47 I live in Britain, I don't get it.
01:00:49 You know, right now, we're going to get like,
01:00:52 No Man's Sky is like a new game.
01:00:54 Well, I don't know what it's even talking about it,
01:00:56 really, even though it's not.
01:00:57 People at my work are talking about it,
01:00:58 it's going to be the most epic game ever, dude.
01:01:00 Right, like, a game like that comes out,
01:01:02 and like, again, for a week,
01:01:04 it's going to be a big deal,
01:01:06 everyone's going to play that,
01:01:07 but imagine if all those...
01:01:08 Imagine, just for a second,
01:01:10 if everyone who played No Man's Sky
01:01:12 instead played like, Deus Ex.
01:01:17 Like, everyone just took a classic game
01:01:20 that everyone agrees is a classic,
01:01:22 and we all just decided to play that
01:01:24 instead of the one new game.
01:01:25 Because here's...
01:01:26 This was my other advice.
01:01:28 Back when I said I had two pieces of advice
01:01:30 to the people who are...
01:01:32 What's the word we're using?
01:01:34 CredFag.
01:01:35 The other piece of advice is,
01:01:36 like, and Charlie was kind of saying this before,
01:01:39 it's still the same amount of content
01:01:42 to play like an older one, right?
01:01:45 Like, people think of it as,
01:01:47 oh man, I have to play through
01:01:48 all these Yakuza games, right?
01:01:50 But like, you can probably beat a Yakuza game
01:01:52 in like two days,
01:01:54 and so playing through six Yakuza games
01:01:57 is going to take you like a week and a half.
01:01:59 How long did it take you to play through all of them
01:02:01 for your next favorite video?
01:02:04 It actually took me a while.
01:02:06 Over the course of like a year,
01:02:07 I recorded footage for that video.
01:02:09 Okay, but it's not like the games themselves are that long.
01:02:12 Hey man, Hayden gets distracted easily.
01:02:14 It's not like he was late playing shit back to back.
01:02:16 He also, he has a job and...
01:02:19 You know, point me.
01:02:21 Quick, backtrack!
01:02:23 Like, I mean, if it's all the Final Fantasy games,
01:02:26 that's going to take you a while.
01:02:28 But even then, like,
01:02:30 when I play through a game,
01:02:32 I usually play through it really fast.
01:02:34 I play through it in like one or two sittings.
01:02:36 I did all the Souls games in a week,
01:02:39 like at the start of this year.
01:02:41 I played through Bloodborne in three days,
01:02:43 then I did Dark Souls in two days,
01:02:45 Demon Souls in two days,
01:02:47 and Dark Souls three in two days.
01:02:49 Yeah, I did Bloodborne first.
01:02:51 I had played the other ones before.
01:02:54 I just never beat any of them.
01:02:56 Bloodborne is what made you want to play those other ones,
01:02:58 as I recall.
01:03:00 Well, it was that Bloodborne existed,
01:03:02 and Bloodborne is like perfectly my aesthetic,
01:03:04 and it was like a game that I felt I had to play.
01:03:07 So you were saying it was hyped up,
01:03:09 and you felt like you wanted to be part of the conversation?
01:03:11 Well, I didn't...
01:03:13 No, I played it a year after it came out,
01:03:15 so it was definitely not still hype.
01:03:17 I resisted hype forever,
01:03:19 because I actually wanted to play...
01:03:21 Like I said, I'd gotten halfway through Dark Souls 1,
01:03:23 and I'd played a bunch of Demon Souls.
01:03:25 I knew about the series since it came out,
01:03:27 and then everyone was hype about Bloodborne,
01:03:30 and I refused to play it because of the load times.
01:03:33 I was like, I will not touch this game until they fix the fucking load times.
01:03:36 I played that whole fucking game through with those load times,
01:03:39 and then after I beat it...
01:03:41 But the funny thing is, because I didn't...
01:03:43 I feel like, because I didn't ride the hype wave,
01:03:46 which would have done nothing for me to play it when it was hype,
01:03:49 it made no difference that I played it a year later.
01:03:52 I still loved the game,
01:03:54 and I feel like I got a better experience out of it for waiting,
01:03:57 and my brother Victor makes it out like I'm weird for that.
01:04:00 He was talking about Pokemon Go came out,
01:04:03 and I wouldn't play it because it was so fucking broken,
01:04:06 and Victor was like,
01:04:08 but it's what everyone's doing,
01:04:10 and I'm like, yeah, it sucks!
01:04:12 It's a shit game,
01:04:14 and then they finally made it playable,
01:04:16 and now I'm willing to play it.
01:04:18 And he was telling his girlfriend,
01:04:20 he even played Bloodborne just because of the load screens.
01:04:22 I'm like, that's what a sensible person does.
01:04:24 That's a pretty reasonable decision.
01:04:26 Victor clearly values the sense of community involved.
01:04:29 Because they said when they were going to patch it,
01:04:31 when the game came out, they were like,
01:04:33 yeah, we're going to have a patch at the end of the month,
01:04:35 and I was like, okay, I'll wait for the end of the month.
01:04:37 There you go, I can go do something else.
01:04:39 And that's what I mean when I'm saying that playing another game
01:04:42 takes just as long.
01:04:44 You're always thinking Deus Ex is this old game,
01:04:46 it's considered a classic, everyone loves it,
01:04:48 it's considered one of the best games of all time,
01:04:50 but I don't want to have to put the time into playing this old game.
01:04:52 It'll take you just as long as playing a new game,
01:04:56 which is a couple days.
01:04:58 Take out one of the new games you're going to play,
01:05:01 and go play Deus Ex.
01:05:03 Especially if you're just a regular person
01:05:05 who only plays games for entertainment.
01:05:07 I think this is something me and Hayden run into,
01:05:09 sometimes, where it's like,
01:05:11 we've got loads of video ideas we want to make,
01:05:14 and so whenever we're playing a game,
01:05:16 we're thinking in the back of our minds,
01:05:18 man, I could be playing a game
01:05:20 that I should be making a video on right now.
01:05:22 That's the trap I fall into.
01:05:24 The reason I haven't played the Witcher games
01:05:26 is that BunnyHup already did such a good job
01:05:28 of talking about them,
01:05:30 that I know I can't make a video about the Witcher games,
01:05:32 so it's harder to justify them.
01:05:34 That Hearthstone DLC looks tight as fuck.
01:05:36 I want to get into that shit.
01:05:38 How can I justify over 100 hours into a game
01:05:40 that doesn't impact my career at all?
01:05:42 It would just be leisure time.
01:05:44 Imagine that.
01:05:46 Just have an anime playing in, like, the background.
01:05:48 Adopt of course, so you can hear it.
01:05:50 Adopt of course.
01:05:52 You still play the game, obviously, you know.
01:05:54 Right.
01:05:56 If you watch the Tales of Zestiria anime,
01:05:58 you can review the game and the anime
01:06:00 at the same time.
01:06:02 Dude, I don't want to do that.
01:06:04 No one should do that.
01:06:06 So what you're telling me about Dark Souls is
01:06:08 you didn't play Kingsfield first.
01:06:10 Oh!
01:06:12 Let's leave over here.
01:06:14 It's funny you say that, though,
01:06:16 because I have always wanted to try to play
01:06:18 every From Software game.
01:06:20 That's how my mind works, is I play Dark Souls
01:06:22 and I'm like, I want to know everything
01:06:24 these guys have done.
01:06:26 Because surely they've done great shit.
01:06:28 Surely Kingsfield has awesome elements to it.
01:06:30 But it inspired Souls later.
01:06:32 I knew about Demon's Souls because
01:06:34 my friend was a huge Armored Core fan,
01:06:36 so now I want to play
01:06:38 all the Armored Core games as well.
01:06:40 I'm differentiating between two tiers of
01:06:42 Cred because when we're looking at
01:06:44 Cred as in,
01:06:46 there's a story and I want to
01:06:48 experience it, but then I want to jump around
01:06:50 and just get the important stuff and get the Cred.
01:06:52 And then there's this whole
01:06:54 in an analytical sense.
01:06:56 If you want to play the Dark Souls series
01:06:58 and play the Dark Souls series,
01:07:00 don't skip around, play the Dark Souls series.
01:07:02 And now if you want to have
01:07:04 an analytical idea of the
01:07:06 entire design of Dark Souls, then you should
01:07:08 play the Demon's Souls and all the other games.
01:07:10 I think we've stumbled upon a thing with Cred Fags.
01:07:12 There's actually two ends to
01:07:14 the spectrum of Cred Faggery.
01:07:16 And each end is actually
01:07:18 Cred Fags. Like going too far in the other direction
01:07:20 is also a bad thing.
01:07:22 If you're just playing anything just for the Cred,
01:07:24 you didn't play this,
01:07:26 you didn't play that.
01:07:28 I don't want to play them all
01:07:30 just so I can laugh at people, but
01:07:32 I do think some do.
01:07:34 Well, because once you start looking
01:07:36 into this stuff, and we've talked about it a lot
01:07:38 in this podcast, so now no one in our audience
01:07:40 can claim ignorance of this fact anymore.
01:07:42 That
01:07:44 the new ones aren't always the best, right?
01:07:46 And my friend who played
01:07:48 who was a huge Armored Core fan,
01:07:50 he always said that 4
01:07:52 toned it down a lot. It made it a lot more simple
01:07:54 and accessible because
01:07:56 they wanted the
01:07:58 Cred Fag audience. They want the people
01:08:00 who don't, because Armored Core
01:08:02 is never a super successful series, so
01:08:04 you obviously toned it down a little bit for new players.
01:08:06 And then Armored Core 5 came out
01:08:08 and my friend didn't even like it.
01:08:10 Huge fan of the franchise doesn't even like the newest one.
01:08:12 So really, you got to play 2 or 3.
01:08:14 Those are the most acclaimed ones.
01:08:16 And I can totally see people who
01:08:18 play Dark Souls going, I want to know
01:08:20 what From Software did before.
01:08:22 I'm going to play Armored Core 5.
01:08:24 That seems like, you can totally
01:08:26 see that you understand this happening,
01:08:28 but you should say
01:08:30 I want to know where Dark Souls came from.
01:08:32 I'm going to play Armored Core 1
01:08:34 on the PS1, or at least 2 or 3
01:08:36 because they're the ones that
01:08:38 at least look into it and find out which ones
01:08:40 people actually care about.
01:08:42 And that's the thing about us, because we're analytically
01:08:44 minded, bringing it way back
01:08:46 to what you were saying before. It's like we care about
01:08:48 the context of the series
01:08:50 as it moves forward.
01:08:52 We want to
01:08:54 criticize the story, its gameplay mechanics
01:08:56 and stuff like that. We want to see how it evolved
01:08:58 over the course.
01:09:00 It's like ignorant of a certain aspect of it.
01:09:02 What we're trying to say to people is that we're
01:09:04 smarter than you and you're all dummies.
01:09:06 And I don't care about your opinion.
01:09:08 That's the summary here.
01:09:10 Well, that's true.
01:09:12 I just think, I guess what we're really arguing for
01:09:14 is not so much to say that we're
01:09:16 necessarily better, but that we want
01:09:18 more people to feel the way we do
01:09:20 because it would make for
01:09:22 better conversations and
01:09:24 my brother being such a huge Zelda fan,
01:09:26 I would love to be able to talk to him
01:09:28 about Zelda 1.
01:09:30 He's never fucking played it.
01:09:32 I've begged him to for years now
01:09:34 and he won't play it.
01:09:36 I think we can have such a more interesting
01:09:38 conversation about Zelda.
01:09:40 We've got all these people like me
01:09:42 who played Zelda 1, who are so excited about
01:09:44 this new game.
01:09:46 Breath of the Wild, is that what it's called?
01:09:48 Because it goes back to that shit, man.
01:09:50 It's going to take it back.
01:09:52 It's using the Zelda 1 formula.
01:09:54 There's people like me
01:09:56 I know Matthew Matos has mentioned this
01:09:58 in his live stream
01:10:00 and someone else did.
01:10:02 Maybe it was one of you guys, but
01:10:04 we're all like, yeah, wow, this looks like
01:10:06 Zelda 1, that's really cool.
01:10:08 And people who, Jesus Christ.
01:10:10 Never played that.
01:10:12 I think a tree just got knocked down
01:10:14 right near my house.
01:10:16 Holy shit.
01:10:18 The cred facts are coming, man.
01:10:20 They're coming at you.
01:10:22 Somebody draw that.
01:10:24 Look out the window.
01:10:26 Okay, while you're doing that,
01:10:28 what I was going to say is
01:10:30 I really was...
01:10:32 It's not like I hate everyone who's a cred fact,
01:10:34 but it's their existence that encourages
01:10:36 things like
01:10:38 this trend of
01:10:40 casualization, that sort of thing
01:10:42 where people aren't really invested in
01:10:44 the things that made it great
01:10:46 so much as new stuff, new technology
01:10:48 and it really reminds me strongly
01:10:50 of a thing like the Final Fantasy 7
01:10:52 remake, which as a po...
01:10:54 We don't know yet, but the signs
01:10:56 are there that what they're going for
01:10:58 is this kind of, like you said,
01:11:00 homogenized experience of action,
01:11:02 RPG...
01:11:04 Final Fantasy XV style.
01:11:06 Almost a whole other can of worms, which is like...
01:11:08 Yeah.
01:11:10 It does encourage this, because every company...
01:11:12 The big problem is that all these companies
01:11:14 want to have the biggest game.
01:11:16 And we've talked about this before that,
01:11:18 again, with those Japanese developers
01:11:20 who are still sticking to their PS2
01:11:22 graphics and still making big, expansive
01:11:24 games with really unique systems.
01:11:26 Those people are making those games
01:11:28 because they know that there's an audience
01:11:30 who wants those systems.
01:11:32 Whereas Final Fantasy VII
01:11:34 was a great game,
01:11:36 and it had its own style,
01:11:38 and the problem is not that Square Enix...
01:11:40 The problem is they want a bigger audience.
01:11:42 They want Final Fantasy VII to be played
01:11:44 by everybody.
01:11:46 They have to sell 10 million units
01:11:48 because they're fucking in the red.
01:11:50 They're going to make it the most broadly appealing
01:11:52 game possible, which loses out on hitting
01:11:54 anyone deeply, because something that's
01:11:56 niche will...
01:11:58 The people who are into something niche
01:12:00 appreciate it way more than
01:12:02 the people who are into something strong.
01:12:04 Some of the decisions, though, on a logical level
01:12:06 just blow my mind.
01:12:08 When I played the Ratchet remake,
01:12:10 and I'm getting all these
01:12:12 tutorial messages on where to go,
01:12:14 like, you run out ammo, change weapons,
01:12:16 everyone's talking to you, and I'm like,
01:12:18 okay, this game is for kids, but I was a kid
01:12:20 when I played the original game.
01:12:22 I didn't get any of this,
01:12:24 and I beat the game, and it wasn't like...
01:12:26 I'm thinking, like,
01:12:28 what has changed?
01:12:30 Like, are kids dominoes?
01:12:32 Is that what they're trying to say?
01:12:34 Can kids not handle a more sarcastic narrative
01:12:36 with under-characters?
01:12:38 Can kids not handle good writing anymore?
01:12:40 What it really shows is that the adults
01:12:42 think that the kids can't handle it.
01:12:44 That's what it's really telling you.
01:12:46 No, because they probably did some, like, stupid,
01:12:48 like, study where they got a few kids in a room
01:12:50 to play the game, and then they were like,
01:12:52 I don't know where to go for, like, two minutes.
01:12:54 Which is, like, too much. You gotta know
01:12:56 what to do at all times. It's a larger issue, man.
01:12:58 It extends to a lot of the things in our culture
01:13:00 and the way society's changed.
01:13:02 But let me ask you a question, though, about this.
01:13:04 Is it even possible,
01:13:06 since we're talking about this, is it even possible
01:13:08 to avoid this kind of cycle of
01:13:10 small developer makes great game,
01:13:12 it does really well,
01:13:14 they grow in size, they
01:13:16 get more responsibility, forcing them
01:13:18 to achieve larger, more
01:13:20 mainstream success, and they will just begin
01:13:22 to pander, you know,
01:13:24 and lose their creative spark that drive them
01:13:26 in the first place. Is that an inevitable thing?
01:13:28 Can it be fought?
01:13:30 I don't know. I think, here's what I think
01:13:32 is gonna happen. I think Square Enix
01:13:34 is gonna burn themselves out.
01:13:36 Like, literally, they're gonna run out of money.
01:13:38 I agree. They've been losing money
01:13:40 on all these fucking games.
01:13:42 Every single day, a new promotional
01:13:44 Final Fantasy XV thing comes out
01:13:46 and I send it to Nate.
01:13:48 It's happening every day.
01:13:50 Guys, let me just set the stage.
01:13:52 Little while ago, there was this thing called
01:13:54 Uncovered Final Fantasy XV,
01:13:56 which was a big event for Final Fantasy XV,
01:13:58 which is coming out, it was revealed
01:14:00 when the release date was. At that event,
01:14:02 they revealed that not only
01:14:04 have they spent the money to make
01:14:06 this game over the course of ten years,
01:14:08 but they also
01:14:10 made an anime.
01:14:12 They paid for an anime. They made
01:14:14 a movie. They made a fucking car.
01:14:16 They've made
01:14:18 so much extra shit. Two fun games.
01:14:20 They didn't have to spend money on.
01:14:22 They chose to, and they have to make
01:14:24 that kind of money back.
01:14:26 And here's the question. Here's the question.
01:14:28 If Final Fantasy XV had come out five years ago
01:14:30 with PS2 graphics,
01:14:32 would it be a lesser experience?
01:14:34 No, it would have had gameplay.
01:14:36 It could have been a story or whatever.
01:14:38 It could have been just as
01:14:40 hard-hitting and just as good.
01:14:42 What I think is going to happen,
01:14:44 I think we're going to see,
01:14:46 I think Final Fantasy XV,
01:14:48 which it could sell five million copies
01:14:50 and still tank in terms of
01:14:52 what they needed to make, because the
01:14:54 fucking budget is crazy on this thing.
01:14:56 Because that's what happened with
01:14:58 Tomb Raider and Hitman
01:15:00 and whatever the other one was
01:15:02 that they had published that year, where they reported losses
01:15:04 of games that sold unbelievably well.
01:15:06 Tomb Raider sold
01:15:08 six million, not enough.
01:15:10 By the way, guys, the Final Fantasy XIII
01:15:12 trilogy as a whole has sold
01:15:14 only over 11 million copies.
01:15:16 And that's three games.
01:15:18 It's three games together.
01:15:20 15's not going to work.
01:15:22 I think once Square Enix
01:15:24 tanks and once we start
01:15:26 losing, because I feel like
01:15:28 all those big developers are
01:15:30 in trouble and it's only getting worse.
01:15:32 With this new generation
01:15:34 of games where no one can even
01:15:36 make fucking games for these consoles,
01:15:38 because it's too much
01:15:40 to try to make these games.
01:15:42 I think that eventually
01:15:44 Steam
01:15:46 is going to kill it all
01:15:48 because everyone loves indie games now.
01:15:50 Indie games are no longer
01:15:52 a thing that only
01:15:54 weird niche PC players
01:15:56 who are not
01:15:58 a part of the crowd play.
01:16:00 A game like
01:16:02 Minecraft
01:16:04 or even just Braid or Meat Boy.
01:16:06 These games are such huge successes
01:16:08 and there's more and more.
01:16:10 Every year there's more indie games
01:16:12 that everyone's talking about.
01:16:14 With YouTube reviewers
01:16:16 pumping out reviews of these games
01:16:18 where, again, if you follow someone
01:16:20 like Bunny Hop, an indie game
01:16:22 is being presented with the same amount
01:16:24 of care and seriousness
01:16:26 as a mainstream title.
01:16:28 As indie games become more mainstream,
01:16:30 more and more people are going to go,
01:16:32 why the fuck would we spend all that money
01:16:34 on a big game that's probably going to fail?
01:16:36 The change has started, the shift has begun.
01:16:38 You have to get all those people
01:16:40 and as soon as you have
01:16:42 like, if you need
01:16:44 7 million people to play your game
01:16:46 and your game comes out in the same
01:16:48 week as an indie game
01:16:50 that gets 3.5 million
01:16:52 players because it just sparks wildfire
01:16:54 and everyone plays it, your game's fucked.
01:16:56 I think that's what's going to happen.
01:16:58 YouTube has finally
01:17:00 it hasn't totally set us free
01:17:02 but it has created an environment
01:17:04 where you can get reviews of things
01:17:06 with the least possible amount
01:17:08 of corporate influence
01:17:10 of these people
01:17:12 are just doing it out of passion
01:17:14 and they turn it into a career
01:17:16 and there's going to be little things that creep in
01:17:18 but in the specific cases
01:17:20 Square Enix and more specifically
01:17:22 Final Fantasy XV has become
01:17:24 a forced meme at this point
01:17:26 it is an extremely forced meme
01:17:28 and every forced meme is doomed to die
01:17:30 a horrible death and like I've said before
01:17:32 like I said in my Final Fantasy VII remake video
01:17:34 I would really like
01:17:36 Square Enix to just die
01:17:38 in order for them to stop
01:17:40 raping their legacy just let it go
01:17:42 just break into small groups and make little games
01:17:44 you make Bravely Default
01:17:46 you can make games like that, make little baby Final Fantasy's
01:17:48 just do those
01:17:50 and we'll all be better off
01:17:52 what if the game is good
01:17:54 what if the game is good though
01:17:56 what if the best game will matter
01:17:58 mate, you haven't done your research right
01:18:00 Tabata is catering to the fans
01:18:02 I don't know what you're talking about
01:18:04 how could you say this
01:18:06 how could a fantasy Final Fantasy XV
01:18:08 could be the greatest game ever
01:18:10 and it still won't sell enough
01:18:12 to make back its money
01:18:14 it'll still kill Square Enix
01:18:16 isn't that funny though with Final Fantasy
01:18:18 the way the Final Fantasy franchise started
01:18:20 like they were dying
01:18:22 they created this one last game and it saved them
01:18:24 Final Fantasy XV is finally
01:18:26 full circle
01:18:28 it kills itself
01:18:30 I don't think it's going to die right after 15
01:18:32 because they've got their other
01:18:34 branches that sustain
01:18:36 they've got KH3 which will sell
01:18:38 KH3 will do fine
01:18:40 but will it make back its budget
01:18:42 the game's been in development for quite a while
01:18:44 it's going to be a long, every jug or not
01:18:46 when it begins to go away
01:18:48 it will kick and scream
01:18:50 it cannot do anything but resist
01:18:52 its inevitable death and decline
01:18:54 so there will be a long
01:18:56 if it does in fact die
01:18:58 which I mean everything dies eventually
01:19:00 it will be a very long drawn out painful process
01:19:02 for every party involved
01:19:04 and no one's going to come out good at the end of that
01:19:06 especially not my beloved Final Fantasy
01:19:08 I mean somehow Konami is still
01:19:10 kicking
01:19:12 for how much longer man who knows
01:19:14 they're Pachinko
01:19:16 they're a gambling company
01:19:18 that's the sad thing though
01:19:20 when these IPs die
01:19:22 they don't just die
01:19:24 they become chained
01:19:26 turn into a fucking Pachinko machine
01:19:28 it's like watching her
01:19:30 she was so much more
01:19:32 it's hard to even say it but
01:19:34 she was treated with more respect
01:19:36 by being a character in Metal Gear Solid 3
01:19:38 and now they're fucking slapping her
01:19:40 it's so disrespectful
01:19:42 it's like these franchises
01:19:44 they can't get off the ship
01:19:46 they got to go down with the ship
01:19:48 and drown in the water because
01:19:50 the companies aren't going to sell these giant IPs
01:19:52 it's all they got left
01:19:54 but what they are now is the ship has gone down
01:19:56 and the company is rapidly wrapping duct tape
01:19:58 where the water is coming in through the sides
01:20:00 and they're like oh god we got to hold it
01:20:02 we got to survive as long as possible
01:20:04 I think what all these companies are missing
01:20:06 like the forest
01:20:08 that they're missing for the trees
01:20:10 the trees being their big budget games
01:20:12 back in the 90's
01:20:14 a new great game came out
01:20:16 all the time
01:20:18 we keep saying our Final Fantasy
01:20:20 had a game every fucking year
01:20:22 in the 90's
01:20:24 when I looked at that Wikipedia page
01:20:26 sorry I muted my mind
01:20:28 who's got a dick in his mouth right now
01:20:30 I muted my mind to have a biscuit
01:20:32 but I had to jump in
01:20:34 so I unmuted it halfway through
01:20:36 it blew my mind when I looked at that
01:20:38 Wikipedia page of the Final Fantasy timeline
01:20:40 release dates
01:20:42 and it's like seven, eight, nine, ten
01:20:44 four games in like four or five years
01:20:46 one who's linked to that bitch
01:20:48 and tactics too
01:20:50 don't forget tactics
01:20:52 what is the benefit of waiting
01:20:54 five years for one first game
01:20:56 these people have not decided this model
01:20:58 it has been basically forced upon them
01:21:00 by perceived
01:21:02 demands
01:21:04 the thing is that the reason that
01:21:06 they're not getting that
01:21:08 why that's such a big problem
01:21:10 is that you look at your PS2 library
01:21:12 there's a million thousand fucking games
01:21:14 you look at your PS3 and even that
01:21:16 eventually it had a decent catalog
01:21:18 you look at your PS4, it's been out for years
01:21:20 there's nothing on it
01:21:22 the Wii U has been out for years
01:21:24 it has like ten great games
01:21:26 and they're all great but that's all there is
01:21:28 literally zero
01:21:30 I go to a shop
01:21:32 and look at the PS4 section
01:21:34 I don't see like
01:21:36 I don't see like this is like the game
01:21:38 of the generations
01:21:40 I guess Bloodborne
01:21:42 if you go to GameStop
01:21:44 they still have an Xbox 360
01:21:46 section that covers three fucking
01:21:48 walls because so many games came out
01:21:50 for that console
01:21:52 the PS4 section is so weird because it's like
01:21:54 like PS3 ports
01:21:56 a few new games and then loads of PC
01:21:58 indie games that have been ported over into boxes
01:22:00 it's the weirdest thing
01:22:02 it's so
01:22:04 like it's like maybe there'll be like ten
01:22:06 original PS4 owner of games
01:22:08 and the rest is like ports and
01:22:10 the fucking Wii U shelf is depressing
01:22:12 because I was there
01:22:14 I was there the other time, I was at GameStop just like yesterday
01:22:16 and it's just this one
01:22:18 little rat and I'm like that's it
01:22:20 you know that's the whole Wii U
01:22:22 and it's going out
01:22:24 the Vita section?
01:22:26 some stores don't have a Vita section anymore
01:22:28 it's like
01:22:30 I'm not surprised
01:22:32 why this is such a problem is that
01:22:34 people need
01:22:36 like people there is a huge demand
01:22:38 for there to always be a game to play
01:22:40 because people aren't going to wait around
01:22:42 and you know and this is why a game like
01:22:44 Overwatch is such a huge deal
01:22:46 because Overwatch is a game that will keep you busy
01:22:48 for indefinitely
01:22:50 you know like it's a game that because
01:22:52 people don't want
01:22:54 people want you know those big games
01:22:56 but they want them every weekend
01:22:58 because the way people play games is they go out
01:23:00 and they buy one and they play through it
01:23:02 and then they need something else
01:23:04 and that is why credit facts go back and play
01:23:06 the old games
01:23:08 there is one game that keeps me
01:23:10 plenty busy on my PS4 and that game is
01:23:12 Dead or Alive Extreme 3 Fortune
01:23:14 oh the only problem is it got
01:23:16 fucking banned in America so you had to
01:23:18 import it so it's not going to see that
01:23:20 on GameStop shelves
01:23:22 point being I think what will kill the big
01:23:24 industry is just the fact that people need
01:23:26 there to be people need another game
01:23:28 people are going to finish a game and they crave
01:23:30 another game and no games are coming out
01:23:32 from these big publishers and
01:23:34 you know when you have
01:23:36 a game like Overwatch come out and everyone can
01:23:38 play it then like they're not going
01:23:40 to bother with anything else they're just
01:23:42 going to all play Overwatch
01:23:44 they won't but what they really should do
01:23:46 is they should completely revamp their development
01:23:48 cycle have the hardware people work
01:23:50 with the software guys I don't know
01:23:52 it's obviously too complex to do easily
01:23:54 but reinvent the
01:23:56 idea of like a great game coming out from
01:23:58 your studio every year whatever
01:24:00 sacrifices you need to make do that
01:24:02 because that will make people buy your
01:24:04 consoles that will drive up
01:24:06 PS4 is like winning
01:24:08 I heard is like doing by far the best
01:24:10 somehow I don't know how but it
01:24:12 is it was all about
01:24:14 winning people got so fucking hyped
01:24:16 for being the console
01:24:18 to play that makes you sell
01:24:20 marketing did it I think
01:24:22 we ran into like a I think
01:24:24 the saddest thing about all this is
01:24:26 the loss of the middle ground
01:24:28 where we every every game is all or nothing
01:24:30 it's all either like a huge fucking
01:24:32 kind of like the loss of the middle
01:24:34 class know what I'm saying like a tiny
01:24:36 indie game and it's like what happened to a time
01:24:38 where we could have like a hundred
01:24:40 like what happened when there was a hundred
01:24:42 games that could come out they were all just the coolest
01:24:44 you know dude like it for the last
01:24:46 two generations everyone like
01:24:48 has been like yo Nintendo where the
01:24:50 franchises where the franchise is going
01:24:52 it's like you remember the GameCube it was like
01:24:54 and within three years it was like boom Mario
01:24:56 boom Zelda boom stuff
01:24:58 boom F zero boom like you know it was like
01:25:00 nothing is a better example of this
01:25:02 than what Matthew Matosis pointed out
01:25:04 in his Metal Gear Solid 4 video
01:25:06 when Otacon does his speech about
01:25:08 like snake you need to change the disc
01:25:10 and he's like Otacon what are you talking
01:25:12 about oh that's right we're on the
01:25:14 Blu-ray double technology
01:25:16 is so fucking amazing you don't
01:25:18 even need to change the disc cue the five
01:25:20 hour loading period
01:25:22 between when you feed fucking need to load
01:25:24 the next section of the game as opposed
01:25:26 to just swapping
01:25:28 yeah great it only takes ten hours to install
01:25:30 the whole thing fantastic just what I want
01:25:32 thirty minutes dude yeah right I'd rather
01:25:34 just buy a game with three discs
01:25:36 and swap them out in ten seconds each
01:25:38 I'm just saying to your next game you fucking
01:25:40 you know this
01:25:42 yeah
01:25:44 yeah yeah you should have to take longer
01:25:46 to play games like we did back in the day
01:25:48 no the point
01:25:50 is technology is
01:25:52 not doing it's not
01:25:54 helping uh
01:25:56 games achieve a better
01:25:58 I don't know it's not it's it's it's working counter
01:26:00 to the goals that I think we can all agree on
01:26:02 you know in a lot of ways
01:26:04 games wise is such a big problem to have to
01:26:06 install MGS4
01:26:08 because I'm a Nintendo
01:26:10 who can't construct his own computer
01:26:12 so you know I think
01:26:14 I think the Metal Gear Solid franchise
01:26:16 right there this like all I have to do
01:26:18 is say a few dates and we can put
01:26:20 everything we've just said into perspective
01:26:22 yeah the first three Metal Gear Solid games
01:26:24 are pretty much considered the best right
01:26:26 the fan favorites four is considered
01:26:28 kind of a let down by a lot of people five
01:26:30 is considered a huge let down by a lot of people
01:26:32 not saying this is true of everyone
01:26:34 because I'm the credit say that it's the
01:26:36 greatest game that's ever been made but like
01:26:38 fucking played that's right but I
01:26:40 think that I've never played
01:26:42 I think
01:26:44 I think if you really want perspective on
01:26:46 whether or not you like Metal Gear Solid 5
01:26:48 we can all agree that they're that
01:26:50 like Metal Gear Solid 1, 2, and 3
01:26:52 are not that contested
01:26:54 the way that 5 is
01:26:56 Metal Gear Solid 1 came out in 98
01:26:58 three years later we got Metal Gear Solid 2
01:27:00 well to be fair Metal Gear Solid 2
01:27:02 is a little too smart for a lot of people to get
01:27:04 initially
01:27:06 let me finish the states 1998
01:27:08 three years later we got Metal Gear Solid 2
01:27:10 three years after that
01:27:12 we got
01:27:14 three years after that we got Metal Gear Solid 3
01:27:16 then somehow it took another four years
01:27:18 before we got the next game
01:27:20 and it's somehow worse than the first three
01:27:22 and then it takes another
01:27:24 seven years
01:27:26 before we get the next game and it's somehow
01:27:28 worse than all of them
01:27:30 this is the trajectory we're on
01:27:32 it takes longer to make a game
01:27:34 and yet it somehow is worse
01:27:36 I'm just gonna put the rule out there the shorter
01:27:38 your development lifetime the better the game
01:27:40 will be I'm just throwing that out that's a rule
01:27:42 a week might be a bit
01:27:44 no that's it I've made great games
01:27:46 at Game Jams dude we have made great games
01:27:48 at Indie Game Jams over a 24 hour period
01:27:50 I'm just saying
01:27:52 in terms of Metal Gear I am
01:27:54 as if they come up behind you and say surprise
01:27:56 motherfucker and you go holy shit you know
01:27:58 you can't know the games come out
01:28:00 I do like that that's like you know like
01:28:02 hype is bad you know hype is real bad for these
01:28:04 sorts of things from this day forward I'm deciding
01:28:06 there are four Metal Gear Solid games
01:28:08 is V it's just V
01:28:10 it's just a spin-off called V
01:28:12 about a guy called V
01:28:14 and there's four Metal Gear Solid games
01:28:16 and it ended at Metal Gear Solid 4
01:28:18 Metal Gear Solid 5 starring
01:28:20 Big Meme
01:28:22 imagine though okay like Metal Gear Solid 4 gets a lot of
01:28:24 shit deservedly for a lot of things
01:28:26 but imagine if that ending of Metal Gear Solid 4
01:28:28 had come now
01:28:30 with Konami's death how legendary
01:28:32 that game would have been
01:28:34 it would have been the more
01:28:36 like it is it's already probably one of
01:28:38 the most legendary games ever but it would have been
01:28:40 like you know
01:28:42 it would have elevated it more than
01:28:44 this like going out on a wet
01:28:46 fart and like yeah
01:28:48 you know oh well hey you're forgetting
01:28:50 about Peace Walker dude
01:28:52 I like Peace Walker a lot
01:28:54 actually it
01:28:56 I'm a crit fag I didn't finish Peace Walk
01:28:58 Peace Walk is a piece of shit
01:29:00 the final boss the final boss against
01:29:02 pass with the J Rock
01:29:04 fucking 10 out of 10
01:29:06 don't listen to Matthew Matosis it's the
01:29:08 best final boss of all time
01:29:10 no Peace Walker is
01:29:12 inoffensive but it's only
01:29:14 offensive when it's combined with Metal Gear Solid 5
01:29:16 that's for sure
01:29:18 they become a duo
01:29:20 of destruction
01:29:22 towards the entire franchise
01:29:24 so we've kind of explored this
01:29:26 topic thoroughly I mean we had our second
01:29:28 topic I don't know
01:29:30 I don't think we need it
01:29:32 definitely I think this is a pretty good
01:29:34 place to wrap it up so anybody have
01:29:36 any final thoughts oh I've got okay
01:29:38 I've got some final okay final cred
01:29:40 thoughts sure
01:29:42 so I think
01:29:44 whenever I play a game and when I've
01:29:46 played series I really in my mind I really want
01:29:48 to recreate what like if I've missed a series
01:29:50 I want to recreate what it would have been
01:29:52 like if I'd played them in order and if I had
01:29:54 experienced them as totally as they came out
01:29:56 and I think in that sense
01:29:58 like because you can't really
01:30:00 match that kind of experience you can never
01:30:02 approximate what it would be I mean me and Nate
01:30:04 have talked about this multiple times
01:30:06 yep you know like when we played a series
01:30:08 like Kingdom Hearts growing up
01:30:10 and like you
01:30:12 you play that first game and then you
01:30:14 wait years and you play that second game
01:30:16 and it's like it's like meeting all the characters
01:30:18 again and like experiencing that full story
01:30:20 and then having payoffs that
01:30:22 you know were hinted at in the first game
01:30:24 and then years later like two is probably
01:30:26 is like a better game I guess
01:30:28 than one and you could tell someone to go play
01:30:30 two first it's contested
01:30:32 but I do think that like
01:30:34 you you will not
01:30:36 experience it you will have a much better
01:30:38 experience and at the end of the day that's what
01:30:40 that's what media is about it's not about
01:30:42 being on Twitter and knowing what happened
01:30:44 and being able to be in the conversation
01:30:46 it's about having a great experience and if you want
01:30:48 the best experience go to the
01:30:50 start start it from the beginning and
01:30:52 just incident and and immerse
01:30:54 yourself in that journey that's that's what I
01:30:56 say Kingdom Hearts 2 release 2002
01:30:58 Kingdom Hearts 1 2002
01:31:00 Kingdom Hearts 2 wait
01:31:02 Kingdom Hearts 1 2002
01:31:04 Kingdom Hearts 2
01:31:06 2006 so even that four years
01:31:08 at the time felt like forever
01:31:10 I know right and now we're like used to
01:31:12 like okay new Kingdom Hearts 10 years
01:31:14 alright let's strap in
01:31:16 that's normal that's
01:31:18 and by the way chain of memories came out
01:31:20 in the middle of that so there was a real
01:31:22 Kingdom Hearts game to say you're you know
01:31:24 hungry in the middle of that so man there's
01:31:26 been like 20 fucking Kingdom Hearts games
01:31:28 on DS in that time
01:31:30 and I've played literally all of them
01:31:32 and I'm still pissed that Kingdom Hearts 3
01:31:34 is taking this one
01:31:36 literally all of them people
01:31:38 I guess if I have parting thoughts two
01:31:40 credit fags which is probably going to be
01:31:42 most people listening to this because I think most
01:31:44 of us have credit fag tendencies
01:31:46 we've all credit fagged at least once
01:31:48 in our lives
01:31:50 and we probably will continue to do
01:31:52 so regardless of
01:31:54 knowing better but like
01:31:56 you know I don't I don't think it's
01:31:58 necessarily I mean you
01:32:00 you play games you watch shows or whatever
01:32:02 you do it because you just
01:32:04 want to in the moment right and for a lot of people
01:32:06 it's just I got home from work I want to
01:32:08 get excited about something that's not work
01:32:10 and I understand how hype can be
01:32:12 fun when you've got all your friends are doing it
01:32:14 you know but
01:32:16 if you're if you
01:32:18 have any interest in being a reviewer
01:32:20 or speaking about the medium at all
01:32:22 or if you're a fan who wants
01:32:24 to appreciate the medium at any depth
01:32:26 go back and play the old shit
01:32:28 because it will deepen your understanding
01:32:30 of the new shit to degrees
01:32:32 that you did not realize were
01:32:34 possible
01:32:36 and that goes for every medium
01:32:38 go back and look at the old shit even if you
01:32:40 don't like it it'll still in it it'll
01:32:42 make you like the new stuff more just
01:32:44 knowing how far things have come
01:32:46 you know yeah yeah in a big
01:32:48 way and being able to see things like
01:32:50 like like again to use
01:32:52 Zelda like just to be able to see how
01:32:54 the controls of
01:32:56 like the newer games evolve from the old ones
01:32:58 and like
01:33:00 I don't know there's a lot that fascinates me about like
01:33:02 playing Zelda one and then playing a newer one
01:33:04 and being like wow these
01:33:06 everything that's in this one is also
01:33:08 in this one but it's different
01:33:10 it's great go do it play
01:33:12 and you know
01:33:14 going to go I was just going to say you're never going to enjoy it
01:33:16 as much as those people who you want
01:33:18 to be part of the conversation with
01:33:20 if you're not watching the whole thing
01:33:22 yeah especially if it's a bunch of
01:33:24 if a bunch of Metal Gear fans are mad
01:33:26 about five you're not going to be as mad
01:33:28 about five by just playing five
01:33:30 it's not going to happen and you might start it
01:33:32 and go I don't get it
01:33:34 I don't like this like if you started with
01:33:36 Yakuza 3 just say
01:33:40 and I guess my only
01:33:42 thoughts
01:33:44 you know I was just going to say you might miss out
01:33:46 on like
01:33:48 your favorite game of all time
01:33:50 you might miss out on it
01:33:52 if you start skipping
01:33:54 that's true
01:33:56 don't let like the reviewers
01:33:58 and oh it's new so it must be good
01:34:00 determine whether you play
01:34:02 new games or old games because like what's to say
01:34:04 you won't enjoy those old games more
01:34:06 like you don't know you didn't play them
01:34:08 that's true man
01:34:10 and I guess
01:34:12 I just want to say that I
01:34:14 I think we're all cred fags at various
01:34:16 points in our lives like everybody said
01:34:18 and like did you said I think a lot of it
01:34:20 is just an issue of people
01:34:22 have different life experiences they go to work
01:34:24 they come home they've had a hard day
01:34:26 you know doing whatever that has nothing to do
01:34:28 with you know criticizing media in any
01:34:30 capacity they turn on the big bang
01:34:32 theory they turn on Metal Gear Solid
01:34:34 5 and they go to town and to those
01:34:36 people I empathize with you but I'd also like
01:34:38 to say fuck you
01:34:40 you gotta start
01:34:42 big bang theory from the beginning
01:34:44 and I gotta ask
01:34:46 what's the origin of
01:34:48 Bazinga I don't know I need to know
01:34:50 maybe you'll like the joke if you
01:34:52 see the origin
01:34:54 what if it's been this
01:34:56 watch as Bazinga has been like a brilliant social
01:34:58 commentary joke
01:35:00 like every time Sheldon experiences existential
01:35:02 pain when he remembers the death of his father
01:35:04 as a child he says Bazinga
01:35:06 reflexively oh my god
01:35:08 I'm a cred fag I didn't even know
01:35:10 didn't even know
01:35:12 did you be saying something
01:35:14 yeah just if you if you're
01:35:16 if you are a cred fag I have to ask
01:35:18 do you want to be this way forever
01:35:20 cause like that's whenever
01:35:22 there's someone who like keeps playing the new games
01:35:24 and you're like but what about the classics and they're like
01:35:26 oh I'll get to it someday it's like
01:35:28 you're never gonna you're never gonna get
01:35:30 to them if you keep following
01:35:32 the hype cycle and only playing the hype games
01:35:34 you're never gonna end up
01:35:36 like like Charlie said you're gonna end up missing out on
01:35:38 probably some of your favorite games
01:35:40 cause a vast majority
01:35:42 of the best games in existence
01:35:44 are old
01:35:46 and you know people if that seems overwhelming to you
01:35:48 like oh there's so many old games
01:35:50 they'll never be able to play them all
01:35:52 pick a series that you're most interested in
01:35:54 start with those and your life will immediately be more
01:35:56 even if it seems like it's on the
01:35:58 it's on the clunkiest oldest system
01:36:00 of all time just give it a go
01:36:02 just start it
01:36:04 to your friends oh no I'm encouraging people to
01:36:06 play obscure things just to brag about it
01:36:08 I take it back be a cred fag forever
01:36:10 another piece of advice

01:36:34 it's a lot of old games you can't find
