00:00:00 Hello everybody, PCP, hi it's me Gibb. This is The Pro Crastinators Podcast, we're here with Ben and no one else.
00:00:11 PCP, if indeed such a thing exists, hey, fuck, I just heard a beep in my headphones. I'm gonna fill a buster for like 30 seconds while I plug my headphones in
00:00:28 and try and kill some time where I'm talking before I can hear you again. Okay, I'm back, I'm back, good. Podcast works.
00:00:43 So yeah, this is the PCP, The Pro Crastinators Podcast, assuming such a thing exists as of right now.
00:00:52 Oh yeah, the channel's been destroyed, it's gone. Yet again, and nobody knows why, no reason given.
00:01:04 No reason given, I mean that's part of the course, if you're given a reason it's probably like a bad thing.
00:01:11 Yeah. They're actually paying attention like they're trying to kill you for real, but because they're doing their general thing of like, you're just gone.
00:01:19 Yeah. Submit like a thing like fine, I guess we'll be back in some amount of weeks.
00:01:26 Until then I guess this will be on my own, my own Ben's channel I guess.
00:01:29 Or maybe not. Maybe we won't be back in a matter of weeks. We just don't know.
00:01:38 God, I'm like nervous about uploading it. I'm like nervous that if we upload this they'll like take punitive action against wherever it's uploaded.
00:01:46 Why would they do that? I mean, I just don't know.
00:01:50 I mean, that's what they did like when Monkey got deleted, right? They just like deleted all the new channels he started to make.
00:01:58 Right, they also stopped doing that. I think that was because Monkey was being investigated for a specific reason, like oh he's making school shooters real again.
00:02:10 Like oh, he's the cause of it all. It's like that was like a strange thread they were following.
00:02:17 I don't think anything like that has got anything to do with us. I think it's just one of the generic
00:02:24 something or others happened and YouTube did not actually check to see if it was valid or not and they just said oh yeah, go on.
00:02:32 It's a bit weird though because it's like it wasn't a strike. It was just like termination immediately.
00:02:37 There was no strike. Just the channel is gone at about 4.30 in the morning
00:02:46 and then when you look it says it's the terms of service violation
00:02:51 and there's a little like form email saying should I read what the form email says?
00:02:58 Yeah, just if it's got no info that's important.
00:03:02 No, no, no, no. Let's see. It said something about like illegal activity.
00:03:10 Like encouraging illegal activity or
00:03:17 where was the other thing? Here, YouTube account notification. We'd like to inform you we've received a complaint regarding your YouTube account to the Procrastinators.
00:03:28 Upon review, we've determined that your activity, the activity in your account violates our terms of service linked to the terms of service.
00:03:34 As a result, we've terminated your account. We don't allow content that encourages illegal activities or incites users to violate YouTube's guidelines.
00:03:43 The only depictions of such activities that we may allow need to be educational or documentary in nature and it shouldn't be designed to help or encourage others to imitate them.
00:03:51 Um, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
00:03:53 Yeah, so I read that and I was like...
00:03:55 Wait, wait, wait. You are prohibited. You are prohibited from accessing, possessing or creating any other YouTube accounts.
00:04:02 I missed this part before, but it says that at the bottom. What the fuck?
00:04:07 That's, that's insane.
00:04:09 Uh, yikes.
00:04:11 I mean, when they say you, they don't know that this is a shared channel. Like, do they just mean
00:04:16 Nate or what?
00:04:19 What, what, what, I don't know that action. How could they take action on that?
00:04:23 Like if I posted this into one of my channels, well, but like I'm not the procrastinators. Well, but here's
00:04:29 Okay, I guess what makes me nervous is like they say here you are not allowed to
00:04:35 make new YouTube channels or own other YouTube channels. If we upload
00:04:40 some content that is clearly meant for this channel,
00:04:44 then that, I don't know. I don't think it's likely that anyone would like notice,
00:04:50 but I think there's,
00:04:52 I think that would be considered like we're getting around YouTube guidelines and they might take punitive action. I just, it seems plausible.
00:04:59 That seems plausible to me that they would take, they would punish us for the same no reason that they've given here.
00:05:05 Uh, uh, it encourages illegal, I mean, I'm not sure,
00:05:09 I'm not sure if this is specific to like our complaint. This encourages illegal activities or uses, incites users to violate YouTube guidelines.
00:05:17 That sounds like it was chosen specifically or auto-generated specifically based on what our, our crime was.
00:05:24 Um, I don't know that, but it seems specific.
00:05:28 It said, it said we received a report, right?
00:05:31 Uh, oh, well, reports. You're right. It said
00:05:36 we've received a complaint regarding your YouTube account.
00:05:39 Upon review, we determined
00:05:41 blah blah blah and we don't allow current, yeah.
00:05:44 Like had issue with something that was said on one of the many videos on this channel. I'm gonna guess it's more recent.
00:05:52 It could just be like you were puzzling. It could be like a holdover from when Brad had the channel.
00:05:58 But that was like content ID strikes, so that would be something different.
00:06:01 Um, but also there were a few people who were like flagging the videos in an attempt to get Brad off our channel.
00:06:08 Yeah.
00:06:08 So that could also still be it. It's like we don't have any information. We're just gonna
00:06:13 figure it out.
00:06:14 We don't know if like, yeah, we don't know when the complaint was filed. Could have been could have been two months ago, three months ago.
00:06:21 Don't know. We don't know what it was filed, what video was filed in response to
00:06:27 how many of them there were.
00:06:29 I mean,
00:06:31 apparently
00:06:32 they quote unquote followed up like apparently they quote unquote checked
00:06:37 and
00:06:38 agreed with whatever the complaint was, but I don't actually believe that any any human being like looked and checked at all.
00:06:44 No, absolutely not. No.
00:06:49 Uh, it's fucked. It's very fucked. Um,
00:06:53 I all right if if you're worried about like re-uploading we can just put this out as an mp3
00:06:59 We we have like an iTunes feed. We have we have a procrastinators website if like like
00:07:05 It before until we know exactly what the fuck is going on. We can release this in non-youtube areas
00:07:12 Yeah, sure. Yeah, true. Yeah, sure. Yeah, true. Yeah, sure. Yeah, true. Yeah, yeah, I know it's yeah true and sure
00:07:21 Yeah
00:07:26 Shut up. Okay, I'm sorry. Um, but yeah the the channel I mean
00:07:35 My my first thought was it was the um
00:07:41 The stream we did. Yes, where we talked a lot about killing cops in now
00:07:47 Uh, yeah, none of us advocate literal murder obviously
00:07:52 But it could be taken like that if you don't have any understanding of of like context
00:07:58 To be honest, it was my first thought too is is this about the charity BLM support stream? Which
00:08:07 Wouldn't that just be fucking amazing?
00:08:09 If that were if that were what did it? I mean, wouldn't that be
00:08:14 I mean, it would be a goal. It would be a great
00:08:17 Marketing ploy to get us back is saying. Oh, you think black lives don't matter. Huh, youtube?
00:08:23 Yeah
00:08:23 Huh, is that what you think we don't
00:08:26 But they won't they're they won't they we don't know we don't know if that's we don't know
00:08:30 I mean, so like if it's not that there's no reason to go down that
00:08:34 Path of like accusing youtube of something. They're not doing that's just gonna make us look stupid
00:08:39 inciting um
00:08:41 What what what was the description inciting something or um encouraging illegal activities or inciting users to violate youtube guidelines?
00:08:49 I mean, that's
00:08:51 That seems like maybe that would count maybe someone
00:08:56 thought it was terrorism
00:08:58 Thinks that like it's like an antifa terrorist stream or something
00:09:02 I mean, it wouldn't be that surprising to see antifa and they think oh, it's bad
00:09:08 Yeah, well, I didn't mean the stream didn't say antifa
00:09:11 I mean, I might have like joked about it in the stream or something. It wasn't like tifa blm
00:09:16 I mean some people think blm is a terrorism. Yeah
00:09:20 I don't know man. I I guess if I had to bet
00:09:24 I would say that yeah, it was probably that stream which is fucking amazing. Um
00:09:29 And like obviously should not have been flagged or such a thing
00:09:34 But
00:09:35 We just don't know
00:09:38 Nate has supposedly appealed the suspension, uh, which they gave you the option here to do
00:09:45 Um, he he didn't I kind of wish I could have seen what he submitted
00:09:51 Uh, oh
00:09:53 Well, what are you what are you just the same sort of stuff he posted the last time but the bread thing
00:09:58 It's like just as much information as you can. Please could you get back to us as soon as possible?
00:10:03 You know email shit. I don't know if they're
00:10:06 You know, I don't trust I don't really trust Nate to like be on top of this
00:10:12 I mean, maybe you don't
00:10:14 Well, I trust him to be on top of like administrative email shit
00:10:20 I
00:10:20 Well, I mean this is important for him as well. This channel is obviously it is but like he he was pretty
00:10:29 I guess it worked out in the end last time, but he was pretty like
00:10:32 he was pretty like lackadaisical about like
00:10:36 how many like
00:10:38 Like he he didn't want to make tweets about like the the the channel getting hacked for like a week
00:10:45 Last time. I don't know. Yeah, I still don't really understand why
00:10:50 Like something about like keeping his like his feed for the audience like clean, but it's like
00:10:56 I don't know. I mean of what?
00:10:59 Uh, of I don't know. Okay, I don't I don't know either. Um, so that's that's all I mean
00:11:06 That's all I mean when I say that we should um
00:11:10 I mean, we can do the tweeting ourselves. We can't we can do the tweeting we can do the tweeting ourselves, but like that's
00:11:16 uh
00:11:18 Lol
00:11:19 Pcp's dead
00:11:21 Nobody even shows up. This is just us. I was I was so hype
00:11:24 Like like not hype as in like a good just sort of like getting like adrenaline
00:11:29 Thinking like oh, it's just gonna be me. It was gonna be me until two minutes before
00:11:33 Like the the cutoff point
00:11:35 I'm I was thinking. Oh, okay. I'm gonna be I'm gonna be doing the thing myself. Okay. I'll
00:11:44 I'm sorry. I was gonna I was gonna have a whole spiel about like the pcp is just me now
00:11:48 Yeah, every like everyone like I don't expect
00:11:51 Like you were the only one I would have expected to show up tom isn't on that much munchies never on
00:11:58 Digi is very rarely on jesse is very rarely on yeah, and that's it
00:12:02 Uh, it's just me. It's it's you
00:12:06 I would say I would say I'm more on more often than you are right. Would you agree with that?
00:12:12 Uh
00:12:13 I guess I don't really pay you too much close attention to that. You're like usually on
00:12:18 um
00:12:19 I'm usually on I'm almost always on at least on the normal episodes
00:12:24 Is it Nate is never not here like that's so that's wild to me. That's wild to me that he's not here
00:12:29 When's the last time he's missed an episode?
00:12:32 It was a while ago. What's he fucking doing?
00:12:34 What I think I think it was it was a similar thing to this where I was here and then you were here and then
00:12:41 I think they came in late and so well, maybe jesse came in I can't remember
00:12:45 I feel like there was one time when I was in your position
00:12:49 And poised to be the only one
00:12:52 On an episode and I was like, oh, what am I gonna do?
00:12:55 What is this episode gonna be about? Yeah, one of these days it's gonna happen. Yeah, and it's gonna be a historic moment
00:13:01 And it's gonna be really funny. That'll be the straw that broke the camel's back. Um
00:13:07 Nobody. Yeah, nobody shows up
00:13:09 If the uh, we've we've been we've been dwindling and I don't know why I genuinely do not understand why why uh, uh
00:13:18 More people don't feel like
00:13:21 They ought to be here
00:13:22 regularly, I mean I can I I I can see why they don't it's like digi only comes on when she has something
00:13:28 she wants to talk about
00:13:30 and
00:13:32 You know, she doesn't like just
00:13:35 Casual chat. I mean she did but now she does that with me and that was like that was like when may appeared
00:13:41 Did you just stop talking to us a lot?
00:13:43 Uh, you think so? I don't know. It's been so long. I don't know if I even remember what that was like before
00:13:49 Well, I mean back in the old days when we were all cool
00:13:53 We would talk in the pcp chat so much that every single day would be like a like a fucking wave like a
00:14:00 10 hours of like discussion that I would I would wake up to and I'd scroll through it
00:14:04 Yeah, my thoughts at the bottom now. I do that in other discos the pcp chat is sort of
00:14:09 Completely dead and it's not a bad thing really. It's just that
00:14:14 um
00:14:15 There's there's not a lot of discussion going on between us. Um, I mean
00:14:21 Yeah, there's there's less. It's not that we like we
00:14:25 It's not that we never do that
00:14:27 Uh, it's it's it's gotten more rare though. I mean, it's definitely more rare than it used to be
00:14:32 I don't know if I would call like
00:14:35 May showing up the reason why it went from like more talking to less talking. I don't know if there was like a hard
00:14:41 Not not not like entirely just did you specifically? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, I guess so
00:14:48 I guess that's probably true
00:14:50 Man, you know munchie wants to focus on school. Jesse just wants to be away from the internet entirely
00:14:55 It's like people have reasons
00:14:58 I mean, you don't I don't understand the wanting to be away from the internet thing
00:15:02 You don't have to like look at the comments or anything
00:15:05 You can just show up and record an episode and then leave and like that's fine
00:15:11 That it takes like two hours out of your week. I don't know. I just don't know
00:15:17 What everyone's thinking what went wrong. It makes sense to me to me. It's obvious. I should be here and so I do
00:15:24 I can't empathize with other people's perspectives
00:15:29 That's a symptom of autism they say
00:15:32 Yes, so there you go
00:15:35 So to to save this podcast being about itself. I have a topic. Okay
00:15:41 Um, I am fucking
00:15:43 terribly
00:15:45 Fucking exhausted arguing politics in
00:15:49 The social media areas that I frequent. Yeah
00:15:53 It is it is a dreadful slog
00:15:56 And I I see now why people are so angry. It's not because they think other people are the devil
00:16:05 It's just that the small minutiae of like getting someone to
00:16:10 You know getting to the same page like getting to level one with someone
00:16:15 Is so fucking taxing because everybody is distrusting and antagonistic towards everyone else
00:16:21 Yeah, everyone assumes so much of your position based on what the talking points are
00:16:27 They they consolidate your you know, if you're saying a leftist thing and a moderate is like
00:16:33 I don't believe that leftists are good because of these various instances of leftism being bad
00:16:39 Therefore I am going to ascribe all of that bad stuff to you and I'm not going to trust anything you say
00:16:44 And I'm going to assume that you are going to be the worst kind of person
00:16:47 Yes, and they just don't read the thing I'm talking about. They don't read the words that come out of my mouth
00:16:53 And it makes it so fucking difficult to just
00:16:56 Converse people always talk about let's just have a discussion, but they don't want to
00:17:01 Even consider the idea that the person they're talking to is not the worst
00:17:06 type
00:17:07 It could be quite a nuanced person
00:17:08 It could be like a you know one of the good ones you could be talking to right now
00:17:12 But if you just go into it expecting to hate them
00:17:15 Then you will and I will hate you back
00:17:18 And I'm so fucking tired of trying to be the mediator the moderate man that gets people to talk to each other
00:17:24 I can't do it anymore. I quit
00:17:27 I got really mad at my roommate yesterday and I yelled at him and I was a big jerk
00:17:33 Because I was kind of doing that. I don't know. He said he we were having like a
00:17:37 Discussion about cops and he said one thing that was a little more that was a little like
00:17:44 It wasn't it wasn't even he wasn't even being pro cop that would be wrong to say
00:17:48 He he said like one thing about it that I didn't agree with and I like
00:17:52 Really lost my cool and made an idiot of myself
00:17:56 Uh lamal very funny very very epic. No, it's not funny or epic ben. You're a bad man. It's true
00:18:03 You gotta ran it in you gotta be like
00:18:06 Well, that's that's the problem is that if you it's so much less taxing
00:18:11 To go crazy and ballistic and just let whatever reaction comes to you immediately be the one that you go with rather than
00:18:19 Holding yourself back thinking about it and then approaching, you know with more neutral terminology
00:18:26 Because it just it just wears down on you if you talk to everyone like that everything becomes a long drawn out fucking
00:18:33 Everyone says
00:18:34 Ben instead of getting mad and being insulting. Why don't you just why don't you just like
00:18:40 Engage with them. Why don't you just like be nice and like show them they're wrong?
00:18:45 Why don't you show them they're like politely demonstrate how incorrect they are?
00:18:49 Like that's not really hard and and like taxing to do
00:18:53 Like really like annoying and difficult and doesn't work most of the time even no matter how well you do it
00:18:59 Uh
00:19:01 Anytime I don't do that. It's because I'm like, I'm just not willing
00:19:05 I'm just not willing to do that to put that work in for someone. I don't think deserves it
00:19:10 Uh, yeah
00:19:13 Yeah
00:19:14 It's hard. I just I I don't know really what
00:19:17 Like direction to take either. I just stay silent on issues and just let people do whatever
00:19:23 So that I don't wear myself out or I
00:19:27 Let myself get mad
00:19:29 And respond to people like no, you're so fucking stupid. I'm not even gonna talk to you like I don't want to say that
00:19:36 I don't want to be the guy that does that. No, I sometimes it feels like everyone hates me
00:19:40 Yeah, so it's like
00:19:43 I don't want to know what it wants to be. I've been sane. No, nobody does take my take my
00:19:49 Uh, uh heed my warning ebonyzer
00:19:53 These chains these chains were forged in life
00:19:57 Uh, yeah
00:20:00 Be nice kids
00:20:02 um
00:20:04 That goes for both sides. I like sure sure
00:20:08 Like a person on the right
00:20:10 Who who assumes that because I'm not on the right or I'm on the left or whatever
00:20:16 I mean such broad terms, but like yeah, generally speaking. They will like assume that I am like
00:20:22 a social justice warrior out to get a gotcha moment
00:20:26 and but
00:20:28 um
00:20:28 For me to assume that they assume that before they've shown their hand would also be wrong
00:20:34 I need to like and engage with people
00:20:36 normally
00:20:38 Uh and see if they they do things that are like, okay
00:20:42 He's not he's bad faith
00:20:44 argumenting right now
00:20:47 And sometimes I try to push through because a lot of the time you can't tell the difference between
00:20:52 you know someone who's
00:20:55 Legitimately only thought about it a little bit and they're just asking legitimate honest like uh sincere questions
00:21:03 about stuff
00:21:05 Like they've heard a thing and they're like i'm i'm not quite sure about this thing
00:21:08 and if you attack them
00:21:11 They're gonna have a bad experience with you and it's like it's just
00:21:15 You gotta you gotta handle everything you gotta walk around so many fucking eggshells
00:21:21 And then some of these eggs, they're not eggshells. They're just rotten eggs
00:21:24 Sometimes you step on rotten eggs and eggshells
00:21:27 You know and it's like you can't you can't win sometimes it sucks
00:21:31 You know it's a little related. Have you followed any of the shit that has gone down around jk rowling this week?
00:21:41 Uh, I followed it vaguely. I know that she is uh what you would describe as a turf lamal and um
00:21:49 I
00:21:50 But I can't like off the top of my head. Remember what she'd said about things
00:21:54 I've seen you responding to tweets. I hate that guy that guy that guy. Uh, what a guy
00:22:01 Uh, the the the reminds me
00:22:05 What what you were just saying reminds me of is that all right, so
00:22:10 I mean, I guess we can go over what happens if you think it's interesting to to mention but like
00:22:15 uh, Rowling
00:22:16 Rowling says like turfy stuff Rowling says like trans people are you know in so many words
00:22:23 Uh trans people trans women are just like perverted men with a vagina fetish who want to jerk off in bathrooms
00:22:30 Like let's cut to the fucking chase. That's what she's saying. Uh, uh, that's that's that's the effect of all her words combined
00:22:36 um, so she says this and then
00:22:39 everyone in
00:22:42 Oh, did I just do it? I don't I really don't think that's a straw man. I really I understand like maybe it might seem like
00:22:49 I'm complaining about oh people like making assumptions about what I actually mean and strawmenning me
00:22:54 I don't think that's what I'm doing genuinely. I think that's what she's what she's getting at
00:22:58 um
00:22:59 So she she says all this stuff that amounts to that basically and then
00:23:04 You show up and you you you criticize that or you criticize someone who agrees with it, right? Like this fucking loser
00:23:11 Uh, uh, uh, Graham Linnum Graham Linnum

00:23:47 Yeah, I mean you say innocently us, but you know
00:23:50 That you're you're you're poking a protodam to see how he'll react. It's sort of like a yes a joke stir innocent innocent question
00:23:58 That anyone would want to know the answer to could have happened could come up in any in any casual conversation
00:24:05 totally reasonable
00:24:07 And everyone
00:24:08 Everyone is just like it's amazing. It's amazing how instantly it's like oh another loser
00:24:15 Oh another loser incel guy who hates women

00:24:30 It's these white cairns who will who will descend and will respond like oh this guy. Oh, ha ha look how he hates women
00:24:38 It's like because you're criticizing jk or someone as a point like that's it. That's all it takes
00:24:43 They don't just they don't need to justify it at all. They can't conceive
00:24:46 They can't conceive that anyone would be would be here
00:24:50 Voicing any descending opinion unless you just thought that women were bad
00:24:54 And they and they shouldn't be allowed to talk if you think jk rallying is wrong about anything
00:24:58 The only possible reason would be that you are a misogynist
00:25:03 And I don't know whether it's literally that I think it's more that jk rolling
00:25:08 is framing whatever she's talking about as
00:25:11 you know
00:25:13 As like a women saying what I'm saying is a feminist women thing
00:25:18 And if you're against that position, then you're you know, you hate women if you believe
00:25:26 direct quote from jk rallying quote
00:25:29 If you think that trans women are women you are saying that
00:25:34 that that
00:25:36 quote that
00:25:38 natal women
00:25:40 natal women quote unquote
00:25:43 You want them to be molested in bathrooms
00:25:48 Jerked off over in locking rooms by creepy men who are just who are just pretending
00:25:53 Who are just like who just like went through all the trouble of getting like hrt and like an id change and a legal name change
00:25:59 And all that shit. They're in there
00:26:01 Just jerk to jerk it, right? That's the only reason they would be
00:26:05 Uh
00:26:07 And and and direct quote direct. Yeah, this is what she said. She said I am jk rallying and you
00:26:13 This is how I type are a rapist by proxy
00:26:17 comma
00:26:18 sjw's comma ben saint you that's what she said
00:26:23 um
00:26:25 And that's it and that's it. Um, I hate I hate jk rallying. She is bad. She's always been bad
00:26:32 Everyone knows that she
00:26:34 fucking
00:26:35 Poops her pants on twitter like every other month by saying some dumb shit that everyone hates
00:26:41 Uh about harry potter or about fucking genders shit
00:26:46 So, you know just another in a long in a long and very epic line
00:26:52 Of that kind of thing
00:26:54 Just and then this fucking guy graham linem is just like oh my god
00:26:57 Someone more famous than me is also a fucking piece of shit
00:27:01 Just like me that makes me look better in comparison on on this on this. Oh my god
00:27:05 People disagree with it. Look how many fucking bigots there are the hate women. I'm gonna fucking come
00:27:12 And and he's you know, he's got he's just he's just he has he's hiv positive is what i'm saying
00:27:20 What is that true? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
00:27:23 That's probably why that's probably that's probably why his wife is laughing
00:27:27 That's probably why his wife divorced him honestly is probably because he was hiv positive
00:27:32 um
00:27:33 Because from the brain damage she gave himself from like jerking off
00:27:37 Oh, that's that's kind of mean of her to do from like jerking off and eating and eating poop
00:27:42 He gave himself brain damage and got aids. That's I know it's sad
00:27:48 It's sad, but true
00:27:50 And I won't turn away from reality
00:27:54 You'd think uh a writer would be able to write good tweets
00:28:00 You might
00:28:01 You might think so
00:28:02 Graham is very funny. Graham is very funny and cringe. Yeah, this is like supposedly a comedian
00:28:09 What did he write? I think I recognize one of the things he wrote the one everyone knows was the it crowd, which I've never seen
00:28:14 Oh, yeah, that's funny. Uh
00:28:17 He didn't he co-wrote it didn't he
00:28:19 He he co-created it
00:28:21 He didn't co-write it at least that's not what I mean. Maybe he did that too. I don't know
00:28:26 Um wikipedia says he co-created it
00:28:29 Whatever that means
00:28:31 So he's an ideas guy. I don't know
00:28:34 could be
00:28:36 I guess I
00:28:38 I guess did you did
00:28:40 Did you see that um all three of the uh main cast of harry potter rupert grint emma watson daniel redcliffe?
00:28:47 They said trans lives uh trans trans rights
00:28:51 Trans lives matter. Fuck off joe. Fuck off joe. Get fucked
00:28:56 Um, so he said um jk Rowling died. He said the the which is pretty cool the the the
00:29:03 Uniformity with which those people step in line and claim to sincerely believe that someone saying jk Rowling can suck my dick
00:29:12 Is a threat of oral rape. They all say it. They all love it
00:29:17 They think it's totally reasonable
00:29:19 To say something like oh jk Rowling is getting rate oral rape threats
00:29:24 Be just just because she said that sex is real and and women are real
00:29:29 That's why that's why people people threatened her quote unquote threatened her with oral rape by saying jk Rowling can suck my dick
00:29:37 inexcusable
00:29:39 Unfathomable, I mean it's it's it's it's the reductionist argument. It's like
00:29:46 The the consolidation of everything into one point that you can easily tweet twitters that is hell
00:29:51 It's the thing that is destroying our society destroy twitter. I would invite anyone
00:29:57 I would invite anyone if you're bored and you want to see if i'm right just just respond
00:30:04 With something really mean to gram linen
00:30:08 Just just say like something just say the like the worst thing you can
00:30:12 Like just try and try and make him cry because if you win if you you win an argument if you make somebody cry
00:30:18 Just just say anything to him that you think would hurt his feelings
00:30:21 Right and just like wait how long until someone says that you are a that you hate women
00:30:27 or
00:30:28 Something like that right any of the things i've just described right that you're like an abusive woman hating like toxic
00:30:35 man
00:30:36 But also an sjw snowflake
00:30:38 Or something
00:30:42 I mean, it's it's funny in this context and i'm talking about doing this only in minecraft obviously
00:30:50 Yeah, this is true. Obviously, obviously
00:30:54 Guys, ben sain. I think I think I think i'm worried about you ben. Yeah
00:30:59 I'm worried about you. I'm worried about you. Where are you headed? Where are you where your heads?
00:31:02 I'm headed might be a dangerous danger to yourselves and the people around me. I'm headed to the fucking i'm headed to
00:31:08 Fucking the end to fight the ender dragon in minecraft
00:31:13 I'm i'm where i've got my i got my ender pearls. You don't understand and uh, you haven't been playing minecraft
00:31:18 You've been in a coma. No, I think that's not you're actually nate wake up mate
00:31:22 No, they added they added the dragon and the end and the withers and and these are new these are these are all things
00:31:30 They didn't exist before but now they've been here for years
00:31:34 And i'm playing minecraft. Okay. All right
00:31:37 Um boy, oh fucking boy. Oh, yeah, anyway, I did see that all the kids all the the kids
00:31:44 What are they like 40 now? Oh, wow
00:31:46 No, they're like all right. They're like 100 now. God. They're so old. God. They're like 30. They're like 28
00:31:53 Can you believe that like luna lovegood the actress is like a grandma now?
00:31:58 feel old yet um
00:32:00 She I saw I saw that um
00:32:03 I saw daniel radcliffe's response and I have seen pictures of emma watson saying trans rights stuff before I didn't see um
00:32:11 Um rippet grin. I didn't see rippet grin's response, but that's really funny that all three do dude. Everybody fucking hates her
00:32:18 Everybody fucking hates her except for like weird except for like weirdos like glinner and
00:32:24 and carons
00:32:25 like a couple of like
00:32:27 It's like the same it's like the same like older white women that you might see like on twitter
00:32:35 Like responding to you know blue wave democrats who respond
00:32:40 Who respond to trump tweets tweets by saying like by spelling his name lowercase t uppercase r
00:32:47 lowercase urmp
00:32:49 Or whatever or urmp
00:32:54 There's just like a there's just like a certain
00:32:57 Subset there's just a certain subset of a human female
00:33:01 It's it's just like the older you get the the the progression points the progressiveness points
00:33:08 The the progressiveness points you they have a half life and the older you get the less powerful and the less of them you have
00:33:14 You can only put them into so many things these people
00:33:17 They've gotten to the point where like feminism is good and like maybe gay marriage is good and things like that
00:33:23 Trans excuse me. That's a little too far. They don't have any more. I don't have any profession points
00:33:28 They don't have any more points to allocate, you know, they're their supply is dwindling as we speak
00:33:32 Pretty soon. They're gonna have to choose between like gay rights and feminism like they're gonna have to lose one or the other
00:33:38 They just don't don't have the stamina juice to sustain both
00:33:42 You know it's like flexing a muscle
00:33:45 Believing in rights is like flexing a muscle
00:33:48 You can't do it indefinitely
00:33:51 Yeah, it's like
00:33:53 To some extent it's understandable
00:33:56 But thank god grandma does not have a twitter account
00:34:00 Well, they do now, you know, that's who these people are
00:34:02 They're going to they're like getting to the age where they will be grandmas like like
00:34:07 You know the the the whole thing with like, oh
00:34:10 Grandparents they occasionally say the n-word and something like a little
00:34:14 A little bit of a oh, that's a that's a little bit of a racism there
00:34:18 Grandma grandma a little bit of a you know of the times remark
00:34:22 Um, but they say it in at like Christmas and Thanksgiving and like family gatherings
00:34:26 They say it in their own home. You never see him
00:34:30 Um, unless you do and even then you only see him a really big only see him at Christmas and Thanksgiving
00:34:34 And everyone agrees we don't talk about it when grandma says the n-word
00:34:39 We're just gonna keep going. We're just gonna keep barreling on through to the other side
00:34:45 And it's just imagine if all the grandmas and grandpas had
00:34:50 Twitter accounts and were engaging in all of these conversations along with everyone else
00:34:54 They do and the grandpas all have pictures of their dogs or themselves wearing sunglasses glasses or the american flag
00:35:00 I guess they do it's just not as many grandmas all have themselves
00:35:05 Wearing masks or I think I think the thing to do is to do a facebook and change twitter into like the young version of twitter
00:35:14 Which is better and let the old people take twitter and ruin it like they did with facebook
00:35:19 I mean facebook is fine. I guess it's just sort of we can't just we can't just keep losing ground
00:35:24 We can't just keep surrendering more and more territory. We have to take a stand
00:35:29 Now we got we got to innovate like the the whole idea of innovation is to make sure old people don't know
00:35:34 What the fuck is going on so we can sneakily just like plot their like uh mass genocide
00:35:40 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, it's tossing around the g word are we now that's the kind of thing that gets your channel banned from youtube
00:35:47 Oh, no youtube. I'm so sorry. I won't kill you. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry
00:35:54 Please let us let us have our channel back. Mr. YouTube man. Mr.
00:35:59 Susan Wojcicki. Mr. Mr. Man. Wojcicki
00:36:03 Oh, sorry. I don't believe that I don't believe that that autogynophilic men
00:36:09 Masculating as women should be invading women natal women spaces
00:36:15 Um lamal
00:36:17 That's what that's what you sound like twitter
00:36:21 Die, it's like it's like I don't want old people to die. I just know that I don't like anything they have to say
00:36:27 That's right. That's right. It's it's just an unfortunate like you're too old to pay attention to what is happening
00:36:34 And even if you did you would have really stupid old-fashioned takes because you're setting your ways because you're old
00:36:38 And that's just how it is. That's what human life is if you didn't want to die
00:36:42 You shouldn't have let yourself get old enough to start being wrong. I'm sorry. That's just the way these things work
00:36:48 It's it's the way of the world the the the master of the universe
00:36:53 Uh laws of the universe. Hey, yeah, if you
00:36:56 Uh, don't if you if you feel like speculating
00:37:00 I'm I'm thinking because we don't know if it was the black lives matter charity stream
00:37:05 That got us flag seems plausible, but we we can't we can't know for sure
00:37:10 Did we say
00:37:12 Did we do you think?
00:37:14 honestly
00:37:15 There was anything we said on there that was like
00:37:19 a a what what were the
00:37:21 the terms again
00:37:23 Encouraging illegal activities or inciting users to violate youtube's guidelines
00:37:30 I mean encouraging illegal illegal activities as in like encouraging rioting. I guess
00:37:36 We like looting we saying looting is based if it's against war not like things like that
00:37:42 I just feel like that's not that spicy a take and I've and I know that other I've seen other youtubers
00:37:49 put out videos
00:37:51 Who are in support of blm and who think that the rioting is who are who support that?
00:37:57 Right because they think it all like it's all you know riot is the voice of the unheard or whatever, right?
00:38:03 Like is the is is that it do you have to be just like like no riot is ever legitimate?
00:38:09 Is that the is that the implication here if if that's what it is?
00:38:13 I mean, I mean, I guess it would probably either be that we were not 100 critical of the rioting or
00:38:20 Like joking about killing cops
00:38:24 Now I now I I looked at the terms of service. Okay. This is this says encouraging illegal activities
00:38:30 or inciting users to violate the youtube's guidelines, so
00:38:34 It doesn't so it doesn't imply I
00:38:39 Mean it's sort of
00:38:42 I mean it does say that we we violated the terms of service
00:38:45 But the way that we did that was by encouraging an illegal activity or inciting users to violate guidelines and like
00:38:54 So that's really weird. That's like very weird phrasing and
00:38:59 Uh, uh, I looked at the guidelines and the guidelines do include like you're not allowed
00:39:04 You're like you you're not allowed to like say certain things about groups of people
00:39:08 You're not allowed to like compare a group of people to like animals. You're not allowed to call them subhuman
00:39:15 which
00:39:16 I guess you could maybe argue that we did like if we if we called if we called cops pigs
00:39:22 Or whatever or something or said like cops or bastards
00:39:25 Maybe but like the groups that you are not allowed to say that it it doesn't say a job
00:39:30 It does say that like based on a certain cast whatever that means arc is being a cop being a member of the cop cast
00:39:38 Um, I don't know
00:39:41 So if you construed it that way, maybe you could say that but like the wording of those of those words in there are clearly
00:39:49 Designed that it's it's like meant to like what it's meant to prevent is like racist speech
00:39:53 Like you know saying some saying nasty shit about like black people right not about fucking cops, right?
00:39:59 So if that were what did it it would obviously have been like taken out of the spirit of what the rule was meant to do
00:40:05 um
00:40:06 I I
00:40:07 I guess I mean, I think the most likely thing if it was a report on that stream is that
00:40:15 somebody said that we said um
00:40:18 Something that there was maybe a joke
00:40:21 Yeah, um, but it you know and then the youtube bought what skimmed through it
00:40:26 Found the words and said oh, they did say that and obviously doesn't realize that jokes exist
00:40:32 and so
00:40:33 maybe report plus like
00:40:36 Uh, just grabbing the the the transcript led to that
00:40:41 but
00:40:42 I mean
00:40:44 I don't know. I don't really want to assume that that's exactly what's happening. I I'm trying not to I'm trying not to jump to any conclusions
00:40:53 Um, I just you know, we both we both
00:40:56 Independently were like is that why is that what did it?
00:40:59 if I
00:41:01 I mean, I've seen people saying what do I see I've seen people saying
00:41:05 Uh, maybe it was a naughty edgy things. We've said that got flagged
00:41:09 Maybe it was you know, because like you're maybe it was like the fact that like mumki is banned and he's on certain
00:41:16 Uh, uh videos on our channel. I don't buy that. I don't I think that's his own channel back up
00:41:21 He's doing things. Yeah, that's that can't be it. I mean, I would say
00:41:26 I wouldn't say can't like obviously that shouldn't happen, but like
00:41:30 It I think it seems like a stretch, but it doesn't seem like 100 impossible that youtube would just be that stupid about it
00:41:37 Um, but it's probably not it. I think that one's a long shot. Um
00:41:44 I mean, we didn't get we didn't get banned
00:41:47 Or it didn't get banned when we up when we did the blm stream the charity stream
00:41:52 By the way, we fucking did a fucking charity fundraiser and we get fucking kicked off youtube
00:41:57 um
00:41:58 It wasn't that or it wasn't right when we uploaded it. It was after um, we the latest episode
00:42:05 Which I guess
00:42:06 Makes me think that it was something on the episode that went up and I don't remember what we talked about in that episode
00:42:11 Yeah, I can't remember exactly either. I mean, we have the mp3. We could go through it
00:42:15 I get a couple hours. Yeah, I mean I guess I don't want to even if we even if we like fight figure out exactly what it was
00:42:22 It doesn't mean the channel is going to come back any quicker
00:42:25 Yeah, even even if we even if we thought we could identify like oh that must be what it was. Oh clearly clearly
00:42:33 I don't think there will be a moment where it's like. Oh, I see. I see. This is exactly what we said
00:42:37 That was an unambiguous terms of service violation. There you go. Bam
00:42:42 Problem mystery solved
00:42:44 Uh, I don't yeah. No, it's not
00:42:46 What do we gain nothing?
00:42:48 Uh, right
00:42:51 so
00:42:53 Boy, I'm frustrated
00:42:55 I'm fucking frustrated about all
00:42:58 This all things. Yeah
00:43:01 Yeah, but you know what's good
00:43:03 Is that it looks like tom has made a lot of progress getting ready to start shipping out backer rewards
00:43:09 That's that is good. I like seeing those piles of merch. That's that's pretty cool. Um
00:43:15 You know, um
00:43:17 How's your how's things on your end? How's the many list of ben saint things that has to come out?
00:43:23 um
00:43:25 You know, I was um
00:43:27 Well, I think I mentioned last week that nexus did complete his vaporette and I have it. Oh, and I was gonna like
00:43:35 I was gonna like tweet about him. So I was gonna make a tweet and like hey guys
00:43:40 Here's another like like artist highlight for a guest artist. Yeah, you should do that
00:43:43 I should do that, but now everything's fucking falling apart. Oh, I can't I can't
00:43:48 Possibly now. It's just not the time
00:43:51 It's just one tweet. No, no, no, no, I have to keep my eyes on the prize. Um, no, but I will do that at some point
00:43:59 Um, kazzie says hers is almost done
00:44:02 Actually, she messaged me just like right before the the stream started or this podcast started to say like it's almost done
00:44:08 Lamal, which is cool
00:44:10 Um
00:44:11 Jade said she was gonna she was gonna maybe get it done this week
00:44:15 But I think she's like at camp or god she's I forget she told me she was going somewhere for a little while
00:44:20 So I guess she's must be up. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine
00:44:24 And then I'm just curious about like why to go somewhere during the pandemic
00:44:29 She I I don't remember
00:44:32 Um, I probably shouldn't like I probably shouldn't like read out what she said
00:44:35 She said she was going somewhere
00:44:38 And was gonna try and have it done before she left which was the end of last week
00:44:41 But the week has ended and it didn't work
00:44:44 But whatever so kazzie said she's almost done
00:44:47 So if she ends finish this soon, that'll be four out of six and then munchie says he is working on it
00:44:53 He says he's working on it every day
00:44:55 Which okay, uh, I don't know how close he is
00:44:59 Uh, how many pages are all these guys doing how many I don't remember how many yours was like what like six pages five
00:45:07 Something like that. Um, I mean nexus says is longer than that
00:45:14 Um
00:45:15 Munchies is shorter. Well, no, maybe it's similar. I don't know
00:45:20 Uh, I don't I don't I don't actually know how many pages it. Um, I think that
00:45:25 jades was was maybe a little longer than yours and kazzie's was also
00:45:32 longer, they're a little longer than
00:45:35 They're a little longer than like the two page ones from uh last time
00:45:39 So, I mean they're a little more substantial. It's good. The book is gonna be like half vaporette content
00:45:45 I think or pretty close to it
00:45:47 Um, so, you know, I mean they're doing they're doing work
00:45:51 Um, uh, how about the rfck pins? So, oh, oh, oh, you know, I have um
00:45:58 God
00:46:00 Really frustrating
00:46:01 So the pins I have um, I I actually have samples of
00:46:06 Six of them. I think I have the potrin. I have the map. I have
00:46:11 Endless not endless war. I have the slime corp. I have the slime heart. I have the lord of ghosts
00:46:16 And I'm missing one. I don't know. Uh, I have samples of those here right now and they are producing
00:46:23 I just told them to produce samples of the last like 18
00:46:27 Uh model so they are making samples of of a bunch more right now. They're gonna send them to me
00:46:32 It's gonna be pretty good. I will make like last minute color adjustments when I see how they look in person
00:46:37 Um, so the pins coming along really good
00:46:41 The patches the the the other company I found that makes patches
00:46:45 The woman I'm talking to is so fucking frustrating. She's so useless. I hate her
00:46:50 Like she made the sample pin the patches and like they looked pretty good
00:46:55 I had a couple of like things and I was like, hey, could you change this could you change this?
00:46:58 But they look really good. I was really happy with them
00:47:00 And she's so difficult like I make like really simple requests. I'm like, hey
00:47:05 What colors did you use?
00:47:08 And like she will take like two days to get back to me or until answer with like something unrelated and I'll be like
00:47:13 I just want to know what color please tell me what colors you use and I'll I'll I'll I'll have to ask multiple times
00:47:18 Or like, okay, can I see a picture of what the threads look like so I can compare colors and like
00:47:24 Again, like it's like a 50 50 chance whether she will actually like answer the question
00:47:29 I'm asking or like do the thing that I want her to do to help me make this fucking order
00:47:34 She's so dumb or like doesn't understand English or
00:47:38 Just like lazy and doesn't want to like it's I don't know what the problem is like I cannot tell
00:47:44 but she's so
00:47:46 awful and yet I have to fucking deal with her because
00:47:50 The pet that I've already paid for the patches to be made. They've already designed them. I like we're doing this
00:47:56 It's just like I literally just have to pick out
00:47:58 The only thing I have to do before they make another round of the of the things is like I just ask show me the colors
00:48:04 Please very I'm very polite. I'm very polite when to deal with her
00:48:08 Just said just please show me what the colors look like so I can pick which ones and she's like, okay
00:48:12 That was like three days ago
00:48:15 I hate her I fucking hate her Jesus christ
00:48:20 um
00:48:23 So that's what's going on with that
00:48:25 I went on fiverr and I paid somebody
00:48:28 to
00:48:28 Make a vector out of the slime coin
00:48:31 coin design
00:48:33 um
00:48:34 It looks pretty good
00:48:36 I spent a while like fucking around with it after I don't know
00:48:39 It's like
00:48:40 Little parts of it are like a little bit off-center and I feel like it's small enough that it wouldn't matter if I if I had it made
00:48:45 Right now. I don't think anyone would notice but I can notice that like the border is like not entirely uniform and thickness
00:48:52 But it's like really it'd be really hard. I'd have to like take move everything around in relation to each other
00:48:58 To get it and it's like, why?
00:49:00 Why couldn't you have just
00:49:02 Why couldn't you have just done it 100 percent?
00:49:05 Why couldn't you have just done it perfectly? Probably because she was some girl from pakistan and I paid her like $20
00:49:10 um
00:49:11 but still
00:49:13 Yeah, I guess you get what you pay for
00:49:16 And now I'm probably gonna have to like if I'm if I'm to be satisfied with the final product
00:49:20 I'm going to have to spend any turn of you fucking around with infinite tiny little
00:49:25 Little little like nodes and points in fucking inkscape get that friggin vector exactly how I want it
00:49:32 Um, what else am I fucking doing? What am I talking about after?
00:49:37 Talking about stuff. Oh the um your other lecture
00:49:41 Oh
00:49:42 Oh, that was right
00:49:44 the other thing
00:49:46 Actually, god, I really wish the thing with a channel didn't happen
00:49:50 Because I had just look it's fine. I'll I'll continue. I'll continue as as I was I had just
00:49:57 Finally kicked myself in the ass enough to get back to like
00:50:02 Doing the slime and punishment finale. I had finished the story. I had finished laying out the story board
00:50:07 All right
00:50:08 Like to to
00:50:10 Which was a necessary step in doing it which I hadn't completed yet. I had just kind of done little bits and pieces here
00:50:15 I have the story board laid out now
00:50:17 And I and I have started making assets for it again. I haven't started putting shots together again. I need assets. I'm making assets
00:50:24 and
00:50:25 so
00:50:26 I'm doing that partially because I am not going to release the chris chan 102
00:50:33 until
00:50:34 Slime and punishment finale is out. So oh, yeah
00:50:38 So me getting that done is like a prerequisite to me getting the slime and punishment or the the the
00:50:44 The the thing out the the lecture itself is like mostly edited. There's some stuff I need to add to it, but it's like
00:50:52 More mostly it's cut together
00:50:55 Not a hundred percent and like
00:50:57 There were some things I there were some things I wanted to do with it a little bit above and beyond
00:51:01 um just like
00:51:04 You know the pretty the pretty bare bones editing that I did with the um
00:51:08 With the other one, uh, so, you know, it's it's
00:51:11 That's gonna happen after the pen the finale which I was which I would have been working on
00:51:17 A lot more in the past day if I hadn't if this fucking news about the channel had not come to light and and
00:51:25 Divided my attention pretty heavily, but it's okay
00:51:29 It's fine
00:51:31 I'll get back to it. Damn. So you go um like a whole bunch of irons in that fire
00:51:37 Dude, I have huge amount. I keep thinking about I keep thinking about how many fucking irons I got and how they all
00:51:43 distract me from one another and I'm
00:51:46 Just so fucking bad
00:51:49 I'm just so fucking it's so fucking dumb. I'm I'm I've I've I've destroyed my my life by by not not having everything
00:51:57 Done the fact that there are things that I haven't finished the
00:52:02 I won't go through the list. I've gone through the list a bunch of times in various places. I just I just
00:52:07 I hate it. I hate that there are things that I started that aren't done
00:52:10 It's so fucking like draining it cause it saps my energy constantly
00:52:16 um
00:52:17 The the the the
00:52:19 I will I will receive a passive buff
00:52:21 I'll receive a passive buff to my life as soon as the slime and punishment finale is done because it'll be one more thing
00:52:27 That I can remove from my thought process that room that drains my mental stamina constantly
00:52:32 Knowing that it's that it's that the the promise was made that it would be done and I haven't delivered yet
00:52:37 Um, I will do my IQ will just raise by 10 points spontaneously
00:52:41 Promise if you think I'm stupid. I'm not that's why I I have
00:52:46 That's the reason don't it's not my fault
00:52:50 It's it definitely sucks to have a bunch of things hanging over your head. I mean
00:52:55 That's why I've made a
00:52:58 I guess not a habit, but I've like made um
00:53:01 who?
00:53:03 I me. Oh, I me. I have made a habit of of like cutting projects off
00:53:11 Like it's difficult to just do one thing like you're always gonna have
00:53:15 Other ideas distracting you while you're working on one thing. Yeah, um, which is why for the past well this year is like
00:53:23 uh, just like figuring out how to
00:53:26 Make myself do one thing so that it's done
00:53:30 Lord of ghosts was that um pretty pretty successful. Um, but
00:53:36 uh
00:53:37 it's
00:53:39 It's oh, I've just realized I'm about to talk about art problems. Gary hack it. Fuck you. I don't like you
00:53:46 You piece of shit you little choke for anyone wondering Gary hack it commented
00:53:52 You may I
00:53:53 commented on like why
00:53:56 Like can't wait. It was what was it like can't wait till gibb starts talking about he can't focus on his art or whatever
00:54:02 And I was like, why is this about him? Why why is this not about me? This is like describes me
00:54:07 This would be more appropriate to be said about me. I don't get it. Um, but it was funny
00:54:12 Yeah
00:54:13 Well, so I was thinking oh, I shouldn't talk about that next time but uh, you forced my handband now. I'm talking about that's fine
00:54:19 That's good
00:54:21 That's good
00:54:23 but yeah, I was
00:54:25 I was having because like with a lot of ghosts I had um
00:54:30 Done the sketching and dialogue well before I was drawing it and inking it finishing the pages and releasing them
00:54:37 So what the work was was entirely just sort of like workhorse work. I didn't need to think I just needed to do it
00:54:43 Yeah, so solving solving that problem was quite easy really
00:54:47 It's just a matter of focusing your uh, your your arm your your energy
00:54:54 But you don't need to I have something to say about and so you see
00:54:57 Yeah, did you find did you find it easier to work on like after the sketch was done?
00:55:01 And you just had to go in and do the mindless work of like inking it basically shading it. Yes
00:55:06 I
00:55:07 Okay, when yeah when I did the when I did the vapors or vapors one and two I sketched
00:55:14 And then I inked right
00:55:17 And and I did it like like I sketched it all out first and then I went back and inked it
00:55:22 and I
00:55:24 hated that
00:55:25 Because the inking was like so mindless. It was really boring
00:55:28 And I got like no satisfaction. I got very little satisfaction from it like every time every time I finished inking a page
00:55:34 It was like I hadn't really made anything. I had just done like some mindless busy work
00:55:39 Just some shit that's like required of me to you know to make this thing technically done
00:55:45 Even though like in my mind it had already been done before
00:55:48 um
00:55:50 But I say that I say that but then with like vapors three and champion chapter one
00:55:56 I
00:55:57 I didn't do that. I didn't pre-sketch it. I sketched and then inked each page eventually
00:56:03 Which like broke up the like more satisfying creative work of like laying out the page and like sketching the page and like and doing all that
00:56:11 But like it also it also it was harder. It was less
00:56:14 It was more satisfying work to do that, but it's also way harder. So
00:56:18 You know the end result is that both went very slowly and I suck
00:56:25 Lamal
00:56:26 lol
00:56:27 It's it's just sort of lol. I mean for me that the sketches were very basic very bare bones
00:56:34 And to to ink them makes them appear real and I'm like wow. I'm actually good at drawing. I guess, you know
00:56:40 um, so it was like more of
00:56:43 Appealing to look at once it was inked and I was like the after that shading it was just sort of like
00:56:48 I don't know fill tool gray here and here. I don't know if I can
00:56:52 um, you know
00:56:54 Yeah, my my my sketches for like those when I've done sketches like that sketch the page out first
00:57:00 Mine are pretty basic, too
00:57:01 But I I feel I still feel like that's when I try like I've already when I've done the sketch
00:57:08 Unless it's like
00:57:09 Unless I've left a lot of shit out like I've already translated
00:57:13 The the idea has already come out of my brain and onto the page like there it is
00:57:19 Like to my eye like it's there already
00:57:21 And I know that like it's not done, but like I feel like
00:57:24 I don't know that's the like yeah, yeah, I get that that feeling when I'm
00:57:30 Uh putting dialogue in like I've already written it in like a in a screenplay way and now I've
00:57:37 Putting deciding where to put the switch bubble in the panel
00:57:40 And I'm like and then you know, I sketch it like
00:57:43 When I'm when I'm sketching I just sort of scribble the words in so that I can see like roughly how much space it would need
00:57:48 To write all of those words. I I forget if we've talked about this before do you do you like write out a script before you start sketching?
00:57:57 Um for a lot of ghosts, which is really the only one I've done
00:58:01 Any sort of planning on?
00:58:02 Yes, I wrote an entire screenplay of the dialogue when it came down to doing this the page layout
00:58:10 I based it off of those like the the things that the conversation requires happen
00:58:15 Yeah, uh, but when it came to actually typing it up
00:58:19 I would tweak a few things if I felt like the delivery was sort of weird and not cool enough or just sort of
00:58:26 Wording could have been improved, but the the the focus of each speech bubble stayed the same
00:58:31 I
00:58:32 I have I have never done I have never done like a like a script treatment before
00:58:39 I will have like um
00:58:42 Well, I mean, I guess I like I wrote out the scripts for the vaporettes that the guest artists then you and the other guest artists
00:58:48 Then like I guess followed or whatever for the actual
00:58:52 drawing
00:58:54 Mine my comics. I've never done a script treatment before before drawing. I will have like
00:59:00 I might have the most I might have is like
00:59:03 notes
00:59:05 Even then I don't really do notes because like I know what the story is like if it's a if it like
00:59:10 If it's a short story and I've never really drawn like a
00:59:12 A protracted comic with like a really like long well for champion
00:59:16 I did have notes about like like what like but like whatever
00:59:19 um
00:59:20 For the other things I don't usually have notes or anything about what it is. I'll just know what the story is
00:59:25 I know like what the what the basic beats are and I'll have like scenes in my head
00:59:29 And I'll just and I'll just like I'll just draw it out
00:59:33 And like I'll have an idea like if there's going to be dialogue in a moment
00:59:37 And then like I won't know what it's going to be, but I'll draw it
00:59:40 I'll just think of like, okay
00:59:42 I guess they'll have to do this and I guess he or she will say something
00:59:46 And I'll know like the idea that they want to say but not exactly what they're saying
00:59:50 I'll draw it out
00:59:51 I'll like include their mouth being open leave space for a bubble and then I'll like it'll be done and I'll go back in and be like
00:59:56 Okay, I know the idea. She's expressing. How exactly do I word it? Like how exactly would she say it?
01:00:02 Let me figure out the exact words. Um, I guess it's like that. No, that's stupid. No, that's stupid
01:00:08 That okay done cringe move on don't think about it anymore
01:00:13 I mean the way I was thinking when I did this screenplay it was like
01:00:17 um
01:00:18 Screenplay as in like it includes like direction like character moves here grabs thing throws thing
01:00:25 Yeah, um, we see a shot of this we pan over like like as if it was a film
01:00:30 um
01:00:31 So I can like base the panel layout off of that
01:00:34 Like I know what needs to be shown as well as who needs to be saying what
01:00:39 Um, but when I write a dialogue scene
01:00:42 If it like ends in a punchline, I'm thinking in my head
01:00:46 like I have a some sort of a vision of
01:00:49 What the panel layout needs to look like in order to deliver this punchline or if it's a really cool thing like it zooms up
01:00:56 Like a close up of their mouth and they say fuck you like
01:01:00 Yeah, some sort of some sort of thing like that like silhouetted against an explosion
01:01:05 Um, and they say a one-liner like I I in like in my head. I imagine
01:01:10 Visually what that speech that that thing they say would be said against but I don't need to sketch it
01:01:16 When it comes to sketching I sometimes find that I'm not good enough at drawing to sketch the cool thing
01:01:21 So I have to like come up with something else
01:01:24 I yeah, sure. Yeah, sure. Sure. I've been there
01:01:28 Um, do you ever when you're when you're like writing out a script when you're coming up with the story?
01:01:36 Do you like see it?
01:01:38 Does it appear how to how does it how does it appear to you in your mind when you're like conceiving it when it's
01:01:47 The form it takes for me is generally a
01:01:50 an image or like a sequence of images
01:01:54 and then
01:01:56 I'll be like, okay
01:01:57 That'll happen that image happens that image happens
01:02:01 that image happens
01:02:03 and then the actual process of making the comic is like
01:02:08 just kind of
01:02:10 Making it up as I go along of like
01:02:12 thinking like
01:02:13 All right, so to get so to get to get the characters into the situation where that first image happens
01:02:19 Like what would they have to do? Okay?
01:02:20 I guess they do this and this and this and this and this and this and this and okay there and then then it happens done
01:02:25 Okay, and then to get to the next one. It's like, okay
01:02:27 Well, I guess they got to do this and this and say that and this and do this and this and this and then okay there
01:02:31 There it is there. It happens again, right? Yeah, it's it's like thinking in keyframes or key scenes
01:02:37 Like you know the the big moments that you want to explain and they need to be set up. So
01:02:42 Yeah, or like going from point a to point b
01:02:45 Uh, they need to like if they're in one location
01:02:48 You can just cut to another location
01:02:50 But sometimes you want to have a few panels to buffer it if if it needs like
01:02:56 You know, you'll you'll get a feel for how it needs to to look while you're sketching
01:03:00 Yeah, um, but a lot of the time if I have two cool moments and in between them
01:03:05 I'm not exactly sure how they get to the other cool moment
01:03:08 Um, I just know that they need to expose it something before the next action scene
01:03:12 I sometimes leave the sketch a little too loose and I find that that is sure
01:03:17 That's that's um, that's caught me in a few places, right? I've ended up having to like
01:03:23 um
01:03:24 Come up with something while I'm lining it rather than sketching it which is difficult like a background
01:03:31 Not not really just a background
01:03:33 I mean sometimes a background because I'm just like it's buildings. I don't fucking know. Yeah, but um
01:03:39 the
01:03:41 like
01:03:42 A transitional phase from one
01:03:45 Area to another. I'm not sure
01:03:47 exactly some type like
01:03:50 Yeah
01:03:53 Like it's just it's difficult. It's difficult trying to like because you don't imagine in your mind
01:03:58 The the mundane panels that don't really
01:04:01 Leave much of an impact. You always think of the coolest moments. Yeah
01:04:05 I I think that sometimes
01:04:08 sometimes
01:04:10 Making a story like that is just a matter of finding any
01:04:14 excuse just to move the story to towards where you want to go something like and sometimes
01:04:21 Sometimes it's okay
01:04:23 I know I've done it to just be like
01:04:25 Whatever just have someone say something just justify it in any way. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if it's bullshit
01:04:30 We just got to get we just got to get this
01:04:32 Wherever we're going as fast as possible make it as can make it as uh as efficient as possible
01:04:38 Even and just just get it there
01:04:40 Just stop drawing you don't like draw make it so you have to draw as few panels as possible
01:04:46 That is
01:04:48 I mean it didn't it didn't end up being
01:04:50 Uh a low amount of panels. No, but like chapter two of lord of ghosts where he's like traveling from
01:04:57 You know being in the ocean to getting to the you know endless mud and all that. Yeah, um
01:05:03 I knew that cuz rck is like the grand canyon of slime
01:05:08 It means he would need to go through that slime sea and then end up somewhere else on the other side of the grand canyon and from there
01:05:17 Uh, he needs to travel across the ocean because in my mind it was just like it's just like the earth
01:05:22 It's just real life. It's just is exactly the same as the earth, but like with weird shit in it
01:05:28 so, um, I knew that he needed to go from
01:05:31 Somewhere in the grand canyon to the
01:05:34 Uh east coast of america and then cross the ocean. Yes
01:05:39 Which is why I had the the the cow town
01:05:42 And then the the sea train, but like in those locations. I didn't really have anything for lord of ghosts to do
01:05:48 I just so uh, let's put a cowboy in here. They they say something like we don't like
01:05:53 Monsters around here and they the fucking shoot him. It's like, oh my god. I'm betting shut out and he runs like and it's just a
01:05:58 It's an excuse for a little comedy, but I also need to explain
01:06:02 In my head
01:06:04 It needs to be explained how he gets from one side of the slime sea to another side of the planet
01:06:09 I I really think that a lot of
01:06:13 I think it's underrated how much of like successful
01:06:17 storytelling or making any kind of narrative
01:06:20 content
01:06:21 is about
01:06:23 Like how little can I get away with showing without losing it without losing anything as I like progress the action from a to b
01:06:33 Uh, I think that's just good. It's just good storytelling to cut out craft and it makes it easier too
01:06:39 And it makes you able to to like tell more of the story you're trying to tell
01:06:43 The more efficiently you can do you can you can move the action along
01:06:48 The best thing to do is to have like the world
01:06:51 Because people love building worlds you build the world as
01:06:55 Completely as you possibly can you think of the absolute history of every location if you really feel like going in that that in depth
01:07:03 So such that when you come to deciding what to show from that world
01:07:08 You don't need to think of you don't need to make shit up. Everything's already there. You just need to show it
01:07:13 Yeah, you know you've built a world now just film what's happening in it and the the thing you're showing
01:07:18 is like
01:07:20 You know, um
01:07:21 It can be very brief. You don't need to explain what's going on in the world
01:07:25 You can leave it to people's imaginations to fill in but if you know
01:07:29 Then it's easier for you to structure everything. Mm-hmm. Yeah
01:07:33 if um
01:07:34 I'm uh, uh, if you've
01:07:38 Yeah, I get if you've got if you've got a really fleshed out idea of the world then like that can kind of
01:07:43 I don't know. I guess that can answer questions like if you're thinking like hmm. What happens between here and there? Well
01:07:50 I know this exists
01:07:52 Maybe that that's what happens. Yeah
01:07:54 maybe that's it
01:07:56 Because it's you you can tell sometimes where things are just
01:08:00 Made up out of nothing. They come out of the of the author's ass. They're just like, uh, then this happens
01:08:07 Yeah, and the reason the reason you can tell is that because is there was no
01:08:13 There's nothing possible that could have indicated that this was the case
01:08:18 You know, like it's it's a it's a common thing in one piece where like
01:08:21 um, it's it's not so much that odour
01:08:25 Deliberately puts things in one piece knowing that he will use them later
01:08:28 But he knows so much about the world he's created that he can pick and choose lots of things that he's already shown
01:08:34 Like as mundane objects in the background to become things that are relevant later and then people look back and they're like, oh my god
01:08:41 I think it's a rich tapestry. You know, I think that you know, there's like there's the architect and the gardener, right?
01:08:46 You know what I mean?
01:08:48 Oh, yeah, that's the I feel like king georgia or a martin conversation
01:08:52 Uh, yeah, I
01:08:54 I guess so there was a that's where I heard it on youtube. I I haven't yeah, maybe
01:08:59 I think I might have heard the two of them compared like that some at some point
01:09:03 I feel like odour does the gardener thing where like he will come up with some like weird device
01:09:09 To just like enable whatever he wants to have happen happen
01:09:13 Like the dials or whatever in in in a cloud
01:09:18 zone
01:09:19 My favorite sonic the hedgehog level skypea and and then
01:09:24 Oh, yeah, if he want if he like he'll just come up with that because it enables like, you know
01:09:29 Like usop to do all these weird combat things and like uh, uh, you know
01:09:33 Is it excuse for like long distance communication in a place without
01:09:37 No, no, they have to end in mushy. That's not right. Whatever it enables all these weird things to happen
01:09:42 He'll have to just have this idea for like what if these things did have these weird properties like that would be cool
01:09:47 Um, and then he'll just kind of go with it
01:09:50 Uh, like and that'll be and and if he wants he can he'll bring them back later
01:09:54 Like cuz dial cuz dials are like a pretty a pretty like, um
01:09:59 Versatile concept and like I guess because of that he'll just he can just bring them back and like make them
01:10:04 Show up later like maybe later usop puts them in his fucking slingshot or whatever they do they do a thing
01:10:10 Uh, I feel I feel like he's doing the gardening thing there where he's just he's just he is just kind of making shit up as he goes along
01:10:17 But then he'll like he's he's he's he's grown
01:10:20 He's grown so many fruits and veggies in his garden
01:10:23 That he can then like has a big stockpile of them too
01:10:26 Like he can take any of those seeds you see to continue the metaphor that he's already cultivated and replant them for next year's harvest
01:10:35 I'm getting hungry
01:10:38 Yeah, it's it's it's beneficial for him as well because it's like one piece is just
01:10:44 Anything you could think of there's an island about it. Yeah, there's a there's everything can exist
01:10:49 That's kind of what I want to do is just to have like
01:10:53 Everything that I could think of that's really cool is all in the same universe. There's all
01:10:57 They can all interact punk will meet everyone. It's all in c197, dude
01:11:02 It's all it's all in c197 the dimensional marriage is coming. Yeah
01:11:06 Fuck yeah, um
01:11:08 Anyway, what I was yeah, what I was talking about
01:11:11 um with regards to working
01:11:14 uh was
01:11:15 That
01:11:16 With the sketches a lot of ghosts. Uh, it was easy to figure out how to get myself out a little bit
01:11:22 And I haven't really heard like half of what you've been saying. Could you start over my robot?
01:11:27 For me. Sorry viewers. My I don't know if it was your connection or my headphones, but yeah, I missed a lot of that
01:11:33 sorry
01:11:36 The way to solve the problem of working on things without needing to think is just minimize distraction
01:11:42 Lower your expected dopamine level so that you're not constantly craving a certain amount of entertainment every day and
01:11:51 And you know, you can what you can barrel through and it's quite easy
01:11:54 But when I'm doing this tezuka manga thing. Yeah, um, it is it is a different
01:12:01 Feeling of work. You can't sit down at a nine to five and come up with ideas
01:12:06 It doesn't really exactly work the same way. You can get yourself in a good situation
01:12:11 but coming up with creative ideas like
01:12:15 So that it's it's difficult and it's a different process and I need to figure out how to
01:12:21 best
01:12:22 Make a situation where I can
01:12:25 Like thrive creatively
01:12:27 Have you so that I can have that as my creative way to do things and then my other way that I've already figured out as the
01:12:33 The production way you've you've seen you've seen that John Cleese lecture right about creativity. I have yeah, yeah
01:12:41 I need to rewatch it because I keep forgetting
01:12:43 I know that there's like the open and closed state the playful mind and the and the analytical mind or whatever he says
01:12:49 But I forget how to best get into the playful mind
01:12:53 Thing because I've tried like, uh, maybe if I just drink some alcohol that'll
01:12:58 No, no
01:12:59 Loosen my inhibitions just a little bit because and then once once my inhibitions are loosened
01:13:04 I'm not going to worry so much about the things I do. So I would just create right
01:13:08 Stuff and even if it's shit, I'll do it in any way and then I can look at it later and decide what is good and bad
01:13:13 Like that's not the stupid idea. Very stupid. It didn't really work very stupid. It doesn't it doesn't work. I think I think not for me
01:13:20 I think as a as a concept like
01:13:24 Loose lowering your inhibitions is a good way to get into a playful mindset where you just do things
01:13:29 It doesn't even matter. Just do them. Yeah
01:13:32 However, you can get to that you talked in the money spenders podcast about how like you you get into that when you're like really tired
01:13:39 And I made it and I commented like hey me too. Yeah when I get really tired my inhibitions are lowered and sometimes I'll just like
01:13:46 Draw a thing or write a thing because I'm too stupid not to do it lamel
01:13:50 Yeah, it's like you've got to lobotomize yourself. You've got to become the stupidest motherfucker so that everything you do
01:13:57 um
01:13:58 It is well you you do everything rather you just do anything that comes to mind and then
01:14:04 After that you have a whole list a whole big
01:14:08 Like spread of things that you've come up with
01:14:11 90% of them are gonna suck
01:14:13 But at least you will be able to like see okay, that doesn't work. That doesn't work. That doesn't work
01:14:18 That doesn't work. That's has potential
01:14:20 Keep that and then you just do that over and over again until you have like a like a pile of like
01:14:26 You know, it's like a panning for gold
01:14:29 Get a whole lot of dirt and eventually you'll find a tiny little nugget. Yeah
01:14:33 Yeah, but you got it. You've got to move a whole lot of dirt before you can find those
01:14:37 That's exactly right. I like that analogy
01:14:40 So, yo, not sorry sorry not to distract and we don't have to harp on this
01:14:44 But did you see John Cleese's stupid ass shit on twitter?
01:14:49 It's speaking of John Cleese
01:14:51 John Cleese, I mean he did it in that stupid like centrist way
01:14:56 But he was basically like what he was basically anti tearing down statues
01:15:01 um
01:15:02 He was he's been saying like uh the romans practice slavery the greeks practice slavery
01:15:07 Why don't we tear down statues of greeks and romans?
01:15:11 Like that's not fucking smooth as shit
01:15:15 um
01:15:16 Yeah, that's that's uh, that's a take that is
01:15:19 Uninformed that sucks ass dude very disappointing coming from a cool dude
01:15:25 A pretty overall I thought I think a pretty cool dude
01:15:28 Like like johnny boy honestly
01:15:31 I I yeah, it's I mean it's not a major
01:15:35 Infraction, it's not it's not a major infraction, but it's very cringe and I just I expected better of him, you know
01:15:43 Yeah, he does have old man brain now. He does but you know, he mean he's pretty fucking old in that lecture
01:15:51 Isn't like in that lecture that that that thing he says like I'm very old and I'll soon be dead
01:15:57 And that's like fucking 15 years old or maybe maybe not that old, but I think it's pretty old
01:16:02 like yeah, jeez
01:16:05 Funny funny stuff
01:16:09 Oh, no mortality help. Oh god, I'm afraid
01:16:14 Um gotta immortalize yourself in your creations real quick. Uh, I guess I guess in the absence of any better options
01:16:22 I better get on that
01:16:24 Uh
01:16:26 I have gotten to a point where um the oh am I a robot again for you for like a
01:16:33 Second you were but you're fine now. Yeah, like I saw the thing go red. Um
01:16:38 I have gotten to a point where I have a full outline of the comic
01:16:44 um, and I want to
01:16:46 to go over it
01:16:48 And maybe I don't know ask people what they think I might ask you what you think
01:16:53 um, it's it's fine. It's just sort of like
01:16:57 A lot of the a lot of what's cool about it is coming through my head and I'm aware of the
01:17:03 An outline doesn't really explain enough for a for a person to really get
01:17:08 What's going on you need to expand on each of the points and explain it in depth and at some point
01:17:13 You may you might end up writing a book
01:17:16 So like that's the point where you you don't do that and you instead start sketching because that's not what you're doing
01:17:23 But yeah, I've gotten to a point where I think I have something that is you know, it's doable
01:17:28 Oh for for tezuka you're talking about tezuka
01:17:30 The yeah, the okay, right. Yeah
01:17:33 Clarissa gunsmoke
01:17:34 I don't know whether gunsmoke is a good last name, but that's the the first name I came up with and I can't think of anything
01:17:40 Isn't gunsmoke
01:17:41 And this is not to say that no it's not a good name, but gunsmoke is the name of a show right like an old tv show
01:17:48 Maybe uh, yeah, I actually think it is. Yeah
01:17:51 Uh, I'm not familiar, but I've heard the name but like that's fine
01:17:54 I think clister gunsmoke is perfectly perfectly good name. It's very evocative
01:17:59 I I didn't uh
01:18:02 I don't know. I you probably don't want to give any spoilers
01:18:05 Otherwise, I would ask like give us some tidbits. What's the story about does she fuck?
01:18:12 No, no does she fuck though. No, she doesn't fuck just because she's a woman doesn't know she's a sex object
01:18:20 Does just does clarissa would you describe clarissa gunsmoke as having a big old mommy milkers?
01:18:28 No, no damn. All right. Well, I will be
01:18:33 I mean, she may be a cowgirl, but that's not that's not what it means consider yourself to have lost a fan today
01:18:40 Um, no, don't worry pumps doing that now. Oh, yeah, that's true. That's true
01:18:46 Oh, here's here's here's like some funny fucking
01:18:51 Uh inside of scoop. Let me find let me go to my only fans page
01:18:56 Oh, right
01:18:58 Uh, what was it?
01:19:00 Oh, yeah, pumps bra size. You want you want to learn pumps bra size cannon? I do I do
01:19:09 Uh 24 g 24 g
01:19:13 That sounds it's we that sounds that's a really small number in a really big letter
01:19:18 Lamal, yeah
01:19:20 The the the letter is like the
01:19:22 The the uh the amount difference between like around the the torso. Yeah, and then the bust. Yeah
01:19:30 And it's 24 because she's very small. She's like a tiny I based it basic
01:19:34 Like a little bit off of the the life size punk plushie that I have
01:19:38 Like this is almost like a cannon punk
01:19:41 I sized her up a bit and I figured it out
01:19:44 I spent a few days because it's really confusing
01:19:47 Looking at bra sizes because that's just what I'd like to do. Okay. There's nothing wrong with that. That's right. That's right
01:19:54 I'm I googled it. I googled a 24 g
01:19:58 And I know it does not exist. It does not exist
01:20:02 Unfortunately, everything starts at 30 or 32
01:20:06 Hmm
01:20:07 Let's see. Let's see. Let's see a 32 g
01:20:10 Um
01:20:12 No, that doesn't look right
01:20:15 Okay, I don't I don't think it exists. I don't think that I'm not sure that exists either lamal disappointing
01:20:22 Um, well, maybe oh boy. Oh boy. All right. Hey viewer. Hey, whoa. Hey shut up. Hey shut up a minute
01:20:31 Okay, cool
01:20:33 sick
01:20:35 Yeah, check out her only fans
01:20:37 Check out punk solo fans. There's uh, there's how much how much does it cost to be a to be an only fan of punk?
01:20:45 Um, if you go to the only fans it is five bucks a month
01:20:48 Or you can go to my patreon at patreon.com slash give and take to get it for also five
01:20:54 Dollars, right? That's why I've seen it five dollars per month. That's why I've
01:20:58 Wait, no, wait. No, that's not why I've seen it because I don't patient you for five patient you for one dollar
01:21:03 Yeah, you gotta up you gotta up for five
01:21:06 Five also gets you access to like sketches. I'm thinking of also doing like
01:21:12 The screenplay I have yo I'll patron you for five dollars and you patron me for five dollars
01:21:17 And then we'll both then we'll have added ten dollars a month the global economy
01:21:22 True
01:21:23 That's just true. Yeah, it is it is true. That's how money works
01:21:29 um
01:21:30 Facts, what were you saying?
01:21:34 Uh, I forget I think so. Oh, yeah closer. You are asking me about Clarissa. Um, right the gist is
01:21:42 The she has a gun
01:21:44 And she's a cowgirl and she rides into town
01:21:49 And something happens with the gun and Clarissa in the town
01:21:54 That's as much as I'm willing to give at the moment. There's obviously more to it
01:21:58 But I want to spoil
01:22:00 Until I feel like it's it's more robust and I can give like a cooler synopsis that is less
01:22:07 Like it has more to it, but also it doesn't reveal anything
01:22:11 Dude, that's pretty based
01:22:13 That's pretty based. All right. I'm excited
01:22:17 You think you think I'll have it done on time
01:22:20 Um
01:22:21 Yeah, I mean I've given myself till the end of june to get sketching done
01:22:26 Uh, which means I got like two weeks and a yeah, uh, and then uh
01:22:33 Depending on how many pages it's gonna be like pretty
01:22:38 Like the maximum I can do is 55. I probably won't go that far, but I might it depends
01:22:44 So I really need to to figure out at first
01:22:47 I need to
01:22:48 Do like extremely rough sketch like panel layout like stick figures
01:22:52 No information at all just so I can see how many pages it's gonna take up if I do it. Um, you know, just ballpark it
01:22:59 Um, if it's extremely low
01:23:02 Then I have room to expand things that maybe I rush
01:23:07 Like if I if I'm being conservative when I start sketching and I realize that it's only like 20 pages
01:23:12 I can be I can go over it again be more liberal be
01:23:16 Like have more space. Maybe one of the pages can be like a big one panel person shot
01:23:22 um
01:23:24 Something like that or like a double page berserk spread sort of thing
01:23:28 um
01:23:29 But if it's like like 60 70 80 pages, I need to cut it down and that's that's the the next step for me
01:23:35 Yeah, to figure out how much uh, I can work with
01:23:39 Yeah, I was I was gonna ask you so you don't know how long it's gonna be you don't have like a
01:23:44 Do you have like a ballpark?
01:23:45 Goal I I don't really I mean I don't have enough experience yet
01:23:50 With how this the amount of words or the amount of story translates into screenplay and then sketch will it be in color?
01:23:58 so
01:23:59 Be in color. Yeah, will it be in color?
01:24:02 The the the contest says it has to be in black and white. Oh, but I could easily make a color version later
01:24:10 Um, I kind of want it to be in color because her hair is is red. Yeah, that's the cool thing
01:24:14 She's got she has red fiery red hair like like
01:24:18 Completely red not even a little bit of orange
01:24:22 uh
01:24:23 dude
01:24:25 Let me complain about those pin the pins. Um
01:24:28 They I gave them the the pixelated uh, uh red man design
01:24:33 And they kept the pixelation, but they smoothed out the outer like corner or the outer edge of it
01:24:39 So it's like a a like round, you know over at like egg shape
01:24:44 Uh smooth on the outside and crunchy on the inside has the pixelated jagged edges and I was like, no, no
01:24:50 You must fix this. This is unacceptable
01:24:53 It needs it needs to be it needs to be painful to the touch
01:24:57 And uh, she said we're on it. We're on it, sir
01:25:01 Um, or at least they said that uh, yeah, I think they'll they'll fuck they'll fucking do it
01:25:06 They'll fucking do it. I'm paying money. I had to pay I had to pay $900
01:25:11 I had to pay $900 to get them the last like 18. Um, um
01:25:16 Uh, the last 18 pins like the molds created and a sample produced and then them shipped
01:25:22 It was like 950 or 60 bucks to get all that so fuck. Yeah, so that's fine
01:25:27 That's fine. But then the actual production of the thing will be like as one penny. Uh, it'll be
01:25:33 The the the place I found that I ended up going with is like, I think it's like five cents per
01:25:39 One made and we're gonna end up making like several thousand of them. So
01:25:44 You know, you know, whatever
01:25:47 Uh, it's not it's not that bad. Well, because we went with the chinese
01:25:51 A producer worse will will will end up turning a profit, which we did not expect to when we were when we originally planned it out and
01:25:57 Planned to go with the uk-based, uh, manufacturer
01:26:00 Um epic it's it is it's it's pretty epic. Um, fuck. Oh, no, I was gonna say
01:26:07 What was I gonna say? What was I gonna say? I had I just something popped into my head. Oh
01:26:12 Oh about the um
01:26:14 So about the the black lives matter charity stream, which may be destroyed our the the procrastinators channel
01:26:20 I don't know. Who knows who knows? Um, I did I guess I'm gonna have to wait until like
01:26:27 Channel ad revenue pays out for that assuming we even get it at all now
01:26:32 But like because I didn't want to wait. I already like paid out
01:26:36 Like people donated including like munchy
01:26:39 I've donated 50 and I said that I would pledge 50 and all and everyone else's pledges combined were like 702 dollars
01:26:46 So I went and just like pledged I went and like donated 752 dollars just out of my own money
01:26:52 Uh, uh, just like to before like, you know waiting to like hopefully get that paid out from the channel and get Nate to send it to me
01:27:00 I sure hope we're still getting it. Um, I mean I said I think we should I think we should because
01:27:08 We should because the the google account is not destroyed
01:27:12 Like the google account that's linked to the adsense account still exists
01:27:16 So I don't see why that money would not come through
01:27:20 Um, if it doesn't I guess I'm just personally out
01:27:24 750 but don't worry everyone your donations went through they might have and they I don't know
01:27:29 Hopefully they don't just come out of my pocket lemal. That would suck really hard
01:27:33 Um, but we'll see they've been they've been donated already lemal
01:27:38 Uh
01:27:40 That's a that's a nightmare potential. Um
01:27:44 Yeah a little uh, it's fine. Uh, it's okay. It's it's okay. I'm okay with whatever happens
01:27:50 Um
01:27:54 Well, well, um, shall we go to voicemail? I guess we could go to voicemails. I I feel was there one last thing
01:28:01 Is there any last thing that I wanted?
01:28:04 That I wanted to bring up before we go. You know what if I think of anything. I'll just fucking interrupts. Yeah, let's go to voicemails
01:28:11 Okay
01:28:12 So I've got one two three four five
01:28:15 There's there's five there's six, but one was for digi and digi's not here. Oh, so bummer, uh
01:28:22 Let the meat play
01:28:24 Let the meat cake
01:28:26 Uh, this is I think chad thunder cock. Nice. I remember what he was what he said, but he
01:28:34 Remakes are based and the original demon souls looked terrible. Um
01:28:40 That was that it was about the the the the demon souls remake
01:28:43 I mean, it was mostly directed to nate who apparently didn't like the
01:28:48 The the look of of the demon souls remake. I thought it looked pretty cool
01:28:53 Um, I haven't looked too much. I saw I saw matthew matosis saying
01:28:58 That he thought that like
01:29:00 He didn't seem to be a fan of the look of the new one
01:29:03 I don't know. I haven't seen it. I haven't looked into it. I
01:29:06 Super do not care. I I just think that this voicemail is a little dumb idiot because
01:29:13 Okay
01:29:15 For saying that the original demon souls looks like shit or looks bad
01:29:19 No
01:29:20 No, that's all I gotta say. No. No. No. No, it looks it looks great matthew matosis was saying everything everything old looks not
01:29:29 You you know matthew matosis was saying something about like
01:29:33 Okay, I know there's like the jail part
01:29:36 And there's a part that's a jail with the mind flayers
01:29:39 And he was saying that like the remake seems to be a lot of like
01:29:42 Have a lot of like extra detail in it
01:29:44 And he said that like it was like they added all this extra like detail
01:29:48 But in a way that makes it look sort of like ornamented and like fancy
01:29:52 But like it's not supposed to be a fancy place. It's supposed to be a very like
01:29:56 Drab and like utilitarian place
01:29:59 And uh, he I he didn't like that
01:30:01 Which sounds like a reasonable complaint to me, but I didn't actually see anything
01:30:06 And I've never played the game. So yeah, I've only I've only seen the trail. I haven't played the game
01:30:10 It's good. I have not played I've only played dark souls and part of dark souls
01:30:14 Two and a little bit of blood born and that's all the souls born. I've done
01:30:18 Yeah demon souls the the thing that is weird like about demon souls
01:30:24 is that
01:30:25 um, you know graphically whatever
01:30:27 It's an early ps3 game. They didn't have like a massive hit yet. So it's like certain things look a little cheap
01:30:34 You know, but the atmosphere they created with demon souls is like the best of the entire series
01:30:40 Yeah
01:30:41 Like the the feeling of the locations is just so
01:30:44 Perfectly crafted. That's why it's kind of almost my favorite. Yeah
01:30:48 So this guy's saying it looks like shit. You can go away. That's what people do. Cool
01:30:54 Uh, all right fair enough. Oh wait
01:30:57 I should say, um, we
01:31:00 I mean, who knows if it'll ever exist again
01:31:04 But uh, because we did we did free three people
01:31:07 We did pay the voice bail for three people in voice jail
01:31:11 So, uh, three of them are out on on bail right now. This is lore and it was um, it was uh, oops
01:31:19 Was it was it? Oh god. Oh no, I'm blanking. I'm blanking on who it was
01:31:22 I know it was the japanese man yuta who I guess was the first person we ever put in voice jail
01:31:28 It was um, yeah, nobody could remember. It was um
01:31:32 Oh, no
01:31:34 Who else who else got free? I don't remember. I don't even remember who's in who's in voice
01:31:39 Yeah, we can't even go and back and check. We can't I can't go back and check
01:31:42 I'm blanking. Hey reply in the comments if you were there remind us of remind me
01:31:47 Remind me of who got freed from who got their their bail looks like we're just gonna have to lock them back up again
01:31:52 Oh, no, no, we can't now. How how will we get them? How will we make sure they come back for their their court?
01:31:59 They're they're a trial
01:32:01 We've lost our records
01:32:04 Hey, help us help us enforce help us enforce our our unjust, uh, racist, uh,
01:32:10 Legal legal codes and penalties in the comments remind me of who got fucking freed
01:32:16 I know it was japanese man yuta and two other people
01:32:19 And I genuinely forget who the other two were
01:32:22 Wait, didn't didn't you make an image? What what didn't you save an image of like when you say you freed them?
01:32:29 Like you you had like a scratched off their name. It says free. Do you have that image still?
01:32:34 Oh, you know what I fucking do I fucking do it it
01:32:39 I'm so dumb. It was oh, it was mozilla fennekin and a well-researched thesis
01:32:44 Yes, mozilla. There we go. So the those have bail they're out bail has been posted still in there is um
01:32:52 lull pussies put here eating with spoons who apparently is teen cp

01:33:06 Rightly in there. We're still profiting off of their off of their slave labor
01:33:12 Uh, uh, just as just as planned. This is why we made voice jail to begin with
01:33:17 Um

01:34:42 Okay, this this next one is uh called from lecture hacks. Yeah, it's a short one. Okay go
01:34:50 I have a relatively serious inquiry that I want you all to discuss
01:34:56 Uh, I am looking for some lecture tips and tricks. You know what I'm saying
01:35:03 No, one aspect that I want to ask you guys about is
01:35:09 Titling the lecture. Uh, you all seem to have a different way of doing it
01:35:14 So I was hoping uh, you guys could maybe discuss your thoughts on that
01:35:18 Thanks. Um, just title it whatever you think is funny
01:35:22 But also explains what it is. That's it
01:35:25 I everyone told me
01:35:28 Everyone told me not to title the jennifer dayan writes lecture. Uh, um
01:35:33 Oh, what did I end up titling it? It's like jennifer dayan writes and the birth of a multiverse or something
01:35:39 Yeah, something something like that. I want I just I just thought it was funny to give it a title that sounds like a like
01:35:46 Like a freshman seminar course at like a liberal arts college like the like the class name is like this long like sentence
01:35:53 I just thought that was goofy
01:35:55 um
01:35:56 And uh, so I did it and that's
01:35:59 That's it. Was that seo optimized? No, not really. Um, but I didn't care
01:36:06 Yeah, I mean really the the subject matter is the most important thing
01:36:10 If you wanted to if you wanted to like succeed and be found by the most people then give it like a very utilitarian just just like have it
01:36:18 Have just just make sure the title says what it's about says that it's a lecture and if you can fit like a funny
01:36:25 I don't know
01:36:27 If put a lot of exclamation points in there, I don't know
01:36:32 Yeah, obviously I was I was hoping there would be at least one other person who's done a lecture in here to answer this question
01:36:38 my the the risk a lecture I think I called like
01:36:42 Risk a circuit 101 so like a an introductory course to what risk a circuit is
01:36:47 Which is seems all right
01:36:49 Like like what like the best character in how to appreciate the best character in Homestuck is like
01:36:53 You know that'll that'll get him if somebody doesn't believe that they'll be like what how could they how could they do this?
01:37:00 And then they click I mean, but like I don't know to me a title like that is interesting and like what is this
01:37:06 Like why would anybody make a video call this?
01:37:09 Uh, I guess like we got to check it out
01:37:12 um, so
01:37:14 Yeah, just like
01:37:16 Make it clear what it's about
01:37:18 Call it 101. I get I don't I to me just like calling it something 101 is just funny
01:37:24 It's just funny that there is a thing called like
01:37:27 Sonichu 101
01:37:29 And it's a lecture. So I don't know I could just lean into that I guess
01:37:32 um
01:37:33 Or just come up with something else funny
01:37:36 If you think you have the fucking chops for it you dumb piece of shit
01:37:40 um
01:37:42 That's it. Yeah, it's about it. That's it. Um
01:37:46 This next one this is the one I was talking about ben
01:37:49 Uh, the whereabout it's about Nate. Okay
01:37:52 I don't know should I play yeah fucking play it. Yeah fucking play it. Whatever
01:37:58 Okay, now that you said it that I am
01:38:00 Absoluble crimes they can respond they can respond next week if you feel so inclined
01:38:06 Yeah, so this is from a dramatic tweet reading. Yeah, uh go
01:38:11 In response to one Nate best man
01:38:17 I'm disappointed that I can't find a tweet post anything about blm from you
01:38:24 You've said the n word in videos
01:38:27 Claiming it's okay because you love boondocks rap music content from black creators, etc
01:38:34 And you don't get why people say you shouldn't say it
01:38:38 Because if you really loved black culture as much as you say you do
01:38:42 Now in times where black people need public allies you are a ghost
01:38:47 Being not racist yourself isn't enough you need to be
01:38:52 actively
01:38:54 anti-racist
01:38:55 You can reach so many
01:38:57 I just haven't seen you a creator. I love use their platform to support what he says he loves so much
01:39:04 Which makes me think you're scared to lose subs or you support how things currently are
01:39:10 Because being neutral allows this to continue which is supporting racism
01:39:16 Hmm
01:39:18 Yeah, um, so yeah
01:39:20 thoughts I
01:39:22 I I generally agree with the assertion
01:39:25 Yeah, but I think I I I feel like
01:39:29 It's it's definitely more of like I don't don't want to lose subs
01:39:32 By rocking the boat sort of thing if I don't if I don't say anything political then
01:39:37 Um, I can't lose anything
01:39:40 Um, or can you?
01:39:42 Um, uh, I mean
01:39:45 Like I I I I understand I mean the the
01:39:49 Approach because lots of people do it, but it's like yeah, I don't know you've got a lot of subscribers
01:39:54 You've got a lot of twitter followers. It would be nice does just to say a little thing. I mean
01:40:00 Does Nate I don't okay the one the one I agree with basically everything the one thing
01:40:06 I'm not sure I agree with is like
01:40:08 Is it is it?
01:40:10 I don't remember Nate saying like oh, I love black culture
01:40:15 He doesn't seem like a
01:40:17 Champion of that or anything. I don't know if that's quite fair
01:40:20 To characterize him as like oh you claim to love black culture so much. I mean, I know he does like the boondocks and maybe those other things
01:40:27 I don't know
01:40:28 But yeah, I do think it's I think he just likes things that he likes. Yeah, which are good. Yeah, um
01:40:34 I do think not
01:40:36 I do think not speaking out in support of blm is super cringe
01:40:42 uh
01:40:43 Very dumb and and lame
01:40:45 uh, and I um, so
01:40:49 I don't know I
01:40:50 There's not really much to say like I know that well, I don't I would encourage everybody just to say speak out about it
01:40:57 I think it's good to do that
01:40:59 I think
01:41:00 Like fuck anyone who would like unfollow you
01:41:04 For that like fucking get out of here. I don't know
01:41:08 Fuck youtube who will delete your fucking youtube channel
01:41:11 If you do it, I don't know
01:41:15 I just feel like it's a little hypothetically. It's a little unfortunate that Nate is not here to
01:41:19 I agree say what he would say so like
01:41:23 Nate, I'm sorry
01:41:24 Well, you know, I felt like this like I agreed with this enough to post to to play it
01:41:30 Yeah, I'd like to hear what you have to say. I would like I would I would like to hear
01:41:34 If Nate would like to respond to this next week. I'm sure that would be fine
01:41:39 If not, we'll all be judging
01:41:43 Okay, cool. Yeah, how many more we got one more
01:41:50 Classic Luke send yourself on a high note riddle my ass batman. Yeah, um, he's in parentheses. I recorded this drunk

01:43:55 And the baby was pissing and then I don't know I forget who it was
01:43:59 But he he did the shower speedrun so that he could get laid so that people would think he was cool
01:44:04 um
01:44:08 It was a little avant-garde a little
01:44:10 I don't remember the shower speedrun thing at all to be to be honest
01:44:15 For from last week the whole Nate was like going like the beginning of the other thing. He was like talking about speed running
01:44:21 Getting in the shower. Oh, yes. Lathering. Yeah. Okay. No. Yeah, I do remember. No. Yep. Yep. Got it. All right

01:45:07 But like that's fine. But like it's worth it. We don't know at the moment
01:45:10 It's worth the risk. We don't know at the moment people understand that like if it comes back then
