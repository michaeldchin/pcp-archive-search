00:01:00 do do do do do do do do do do it and that's the end of the podcast everybody thank you for watching.
00:01:08 So rude. Don't forget our good friend that's the Clay Saban.
00:01:14 Fuckbitch is podcast here is everybody.
00:01:20 Yay!
00:01:21 So today's topic is a technical one that some of us are more familiar with than others and
00:01:28 Cicely, but you know I should have beat around the bush for like an hour before I got
00:01:35 That's what it is. It sounded like munchie laughing
00:01:38 It did it did I like to booze like in the distant background laughing like he's off doing something else still listening
00:01:45 No, I pulled the fucking mic away for myself. Oh, it was a spike. Okay every time you've done that
00:01:50 I always assume it's it's quieter because you throw your head back and laugh as loud as you can
00:01:55 That's why it sounds like an owl DNA, man
00:01:57 I imagined he's like pacing in the back of his room whenever he's not talking trying to think of what to say
00:02:03 And then he bum rushes at the mic like oh, it's time to go. Exactly. Um, I
00:02:09 Yes
00:02:14 Hi, I'm close at the microphone now. Is that good? Yeah, I'll just keep looking at
00:02:19 Let's stop fucking around here people. Oh, we have to be as unconcise as possible. This isn't even non concise
00:02:25 This is just off topic completely totally irrelevant. Well, that's that is relevant to this point because I think people when they think of concise
00:02:35 They don't exactly know what it means, right? Okay, so when we talk about concise writing
00:02:39 It's about how quickly you can sort of make a point and like just
00:02:45 Clearly communicate your intentions without beating around the bush and stuff and like there's a there's a huge difference between
00:02:52 Going off topic or even being long-winded like you can be long-winded and concise
00:02:57 I think I haven't looked at the definition of concise recently. I don't know if it has to be short
00:03:03 But like for instance, I often get accused of
00:03:07 By that anime snob that that my hero
00:03:10 Yes, yes my hero, but that's an amazing app whose videos are all under 10 minutes long
00:03:15 And he gives me lots of shit for my videos being longer
00:03:18 And he often says that like, you know brevity is the soul of wit and stuff like wow
00:03:22 He's a smart dude. Yeah, his videos are just 20 second segments from other people's videos. Like what does he even do?
00:03:29 Well, that's the thing is that he he keeps his stuff so short that he never makes a point and it's not that he's
00:03:36 Necessarily concise. It's just that he's brief
00:03:38 And you know what? Yeah, that's interesting because I just went to urban dictionary comm our home base
00:03:43 To look up the definition of concise and it is relevant to this
00:03:46 So the other full definition of definition here is concise to be brief
00:03:50 But inclusive able to sum up a topic succinctly
00:03:54 succinctly without elaboration or superfluous detail
00:03:56 And so the point here is you have to be making a real point in order to concise and if that is lacking that you're just being brief
00:04:03 I guess it's it's how much useful interesting worthwhile shit is packed in per minute
00:04:12 Like whereas that anime snob will often try to he'll take a lot of different points and make individual videos about all of them
00:04:19 I'll just put them all in one. You know, it's not that my writing is not being more concise. Yeah, I'm not I'm not being
00:04:25 I'm not not being concise. I'm just making a lot of points in a row, you know
00:04:30 And that's what he doesn't seem to there can be a lot by the way
00:04:34 There could be lots of works out there that are really verbose and really long-winded
00:04:38 But don't come off like you're wasting your time as long as you're interested in all the material out there
00:04:43 You know, you know, maybe some is it? There may be some very popular
00:04:48 harem anime franchise out there that might have a lot of long-winded conversations or maybe some
00:04:54 I've been reading that might have a lot of long-winded conversations
00:04:57 But if all those conversations are really fucking interesting, then shut up is good as long
00:05:02 It's just that it's really hard for people to meaningfully fill large amounts of dialogue with actual interesting things to say and like anime often
00:05:08 I'll see like like any show in series
00:05:10 I was talking about this like a show in series will start off with a lot of interesting things to say because all the thought goes into the
00:05:15 premise of the show or the or the manga or whatever and then like they just get away from that like I don't know
00:05:20 I think that's part of what makes like Hunter Hunter special or even Yu-Haka show is that
00:05:25 Every battle is concise in those shows where like there's just a shit load of battles
00:05:31 Like you watch you Yu-Haka show or Hunter Hunter would always struck me about those shows is no fight ever lasts more than one
00:05:37 episode, well, that's not true of early Yu-Haka show, but
00:05:40 Hunter Hunter and what's another show? I was thinking of the
00:05:44 Dragon Ball Z
00:05:47 There's
00:05:49 Certain shows where yeah, like a fight is always like at most an episode to an episode and a half
00:05:55 And it doesn't give you time to get tired of it
00:05:56 It just gets in shows off these cool powers right and like makes the point and goes you know and like so many people will give
00:06:04 Showing an anime shit just for being so long
00:06:07 But like how is it long is it long like DBZ where it really is just wasting a lot of fucking time, right?
00:06:13 Or is it long like you Yu-Haka show where it keeps making new points?
00:06:17 Well, dude, there's there's shows I'm gonna bring out as great examples of I think is as great concise writing and one is of
00:06:22 Course Gern Lagen because so much happens every episode of Gern Lagen
00:06:26 It really moves the pace forward at a wonderful brisk pace does not waste your fucking time
00:06:31 And the other one is high school the dead and I really think high school the dead
00:06:34 You know, I made that me a mafia episode about it is really great
00:06:37 And I didn't talk about it as much but that show definitely makes a point in every episode every single episode like
00:06:43 There's probably like people would often think that because it's a zombie show
00:06:46 It's gonna like waste your time and be a bunch of faffing around like oh zombie fights all the time
00:06:50 But no like it's real human drama all these characters developing every single episode you can see them changing and evolving over time
00:06:57 And like the directing is great. It's super hype. There's intense moments all the time
00:07:01 It's got you know, the crazy fan service and action happening all the time
00:07:03 It really again, that's a show that does not waste a second of your time
00:07:07 You feel like you're learning something every time you're watching I I want to I want to say something about like Davoo was in playing that
00:07:14 No, I'm playing it saying users webcomic, right? It's it's Homestuck. He's been reading
00:07:19 Could you could could you say despite its length that Homestuck is concise?
00:07:23 I would not you could probably tell the whole the whole all the fucking conversations of Act 5 in a much more linear
00:07:32 Condensed fashion it just wouldn't be nearly as funny and you get to know all the characters
00:07:37 Yeah, I mean like because I'm what are the end of Act 5 now
00:07:39 And it's like it's like what actually happens in Act 5 gets summarized by the self-insert
00:07:45 Vector in like a couple of pages and it's like, okay
00:07:48 This is actually pretty straightforward plot. It's just told really fucking out of order, you know
00:07:53 Well, the thing that yeah, the thing that I'm thinking of is like it's it's not being brief
00:07:58 You know, it's different from just being brief. It's different from cutting things out
00:08:03 You know like you could you could argue that a lot of the things in Homestuck that seems stupid eventually become relevant
00:08:10 So like how much should like how much is I don't I don't get it
00:08:15 I'm very I mean you guys are talking about conciseness like, you know what it means. I don't really understand it
00:08:19 I don't think like I mean, it's essentially as I explained
00:08:23 It's just like not it's a consistent presentation of new ideas as opposed to reiterating the same idea
00:08:30 Give you ever what watch like Inuyasha or Rambo one-half. Nope any of that kind of shit. No, okay
00:08:35 Well, you've seen Dragon Ball Z, right?
00:08:37 I read it. I don't know if he has
00:08:39 Reading it's actually way better than watching it
00:08:41 So, okay
00:08:42 Well, there's like in Dragon Ball Z for example the classic thing is that like a single fight that maybe took out like a couple chapters in the
00:08:48 Manga like gets dragged out for like for the classic things the Frieza battles at the end of like the first arc of DBZ
00:08:54 Like it takes like so many episodes for just and barely anything happens in those episodes
00:09:00 It is such a waste of your time to like actually sit through
00:09:03 Yeah, that's the thing like that's why I'm thinking like Homestuck so much of it is so great and interesting and it's not
00:09:09 It doesn't feel like a waste of time. It's not like that Homestuck is actually making like like it goes on for so long
00:09:14 And it goes through things like, you know, in case we weren't clear
00:09:17 Davoo was arguing that Homestuck was concise. Yeah with good stuff
00:09:22 It's not concise with like a conventional normal like plot that you would understand as a normal thing
00:09:27 It's just concise with you know characters being manic idiots hours
00:09:31 I would argue that Homestuck does have moments where it does kind of just hammer on the same
00:09:36 Some of those conversations like the exact same conversation you read earlier, you know
00:09:41 Like there are moments where it's it does push it a little bit
00:09:44 But I do think the story has so much going on that like it deserves to be as long as it is
00:09:49 You know, it's appropriate to say that conciseness does not necessarily mean better in all cases, of course
00:09:54 Yeah, I would say that Homestuck really adds a lot of flavor by having like it is about a bunch of teenage drama
00:10:00 Stuff happening between kids it makes sense that wouldn't be concise these kids waste a lot of everyone's fucking time mostly their own
00:10:05 But yeah, and like I said, it's it's about what it deserves like yeah with Dragon Ball like
00:10:11 Because the manga exists and everything like we know Dragon Ball Z didn't need to be as long as it is
00:10:16 We know you could have told they may have improved that without exactly like we know you can do it without taking up that much time
00:10:23 So to me, that's what concise is it's like tell the story or or write your thing
00:10:27 Whatever you're doing just do it in the smallest amount of time that you need and that's
00:10:32 People don't understand that you do need some
00:10:35 Humanity in there you need some extra and like I talked about this in my video about how I learned how to write gooder
00:10:43 Where I in like 2010 I became obsessed with simplifying my writing and like I cut it down until it was like just the bare
00:10:51 Essential language needed to communicate the point, but it felt like a fucking robot, you know, yeah, so like I
00:10:57 So I started going back in and adding in phrases and like adding in stuff that just especially for my videos stuff
00:11:03 That just sounds right to somebody like it engages your brain in a different way
00:11:08 Yeah, you need to have some like you know we're nice and concise
00:11:11 You know those those videos Davoo keeps posting about like a robot obviously made this video
00:11:15 Yeah, those are concise and that's uh, they don't fuck around. They really tell you
00:11:21 Across the United States or whatever hold the fuck on they're not that size the robots don't know shit about fuck
00:11:26 They'll just be like number 12 number 12 person who obstinately refused to tear down their house as Chinese
00:11:33 Highways are trying to be built this person really stood up for themselves and didn't stand down to the man number 11
00:11:40 This guy really goes to show how much society can't progress when some people are stubborn like shut up
00:11:46 Robotic you're fucking boy. So, you know like I did you saying I think there's like four like steps that people go through to like
00:11:53 Master and art step one is you just learn how to basically do anything you learn how to basically write put together a little bit of music
00:12:01 Put together a little bit of painting it starts out small and then as you get more ambitious and more skilled you make something big and
00:12:08 encumber some and
00:12:09 Bloated and then you start learning how to refine your skills and and you just get smaller and smaller until it's this perfect condensed ball
00:12:16 That doesn't have much breathing room and then you use your newfound perfection
00:12:20 Skill to just slowly weave stuff back out
00:12:23 It's like watching like an explosion in like an anime where like it goes
00:12:27 Then it sucks back in and then it slowly wooshes out again. That's what I come for is yeah
00:12:33 Yeah, like like the like the the whole earth. Yeah, the whole the trees go like
00:12:37 It's either real or hey, uh, somebody made me always our good friend
00:12:49 Ukrainian the artist boy made a drawing of like someone when you were posting those pictures of oh, I was gonna say by the way
00:12:54 Did she's calling in live from Gaikon?
00:12:57 2017
00:13:00 Because it was called a Gaikon you don't need to change it to Gaikon Gaikon already sounds like
00:13:08 Gaikon 3 or Gaikon 4 that was the thing that somebody post this guy posted Gaikon 5 and then
00:13:14 Ukrainian drew a picture of me on of the fucking skateboard just being like
00:13:17 I only meant to stay a while as I was like wearing the bunny suit and flying through this guy
00:13:22 It's great. Thank you. You're a gift. You're a gift. Anyway, let's get back to so I don't know
00:13:29 Why don't we talk about like the way that we try to be concise writers? I want to say one thing
00:13:34 Like we're saying that conciseness can be bad
00:13:36 What is the the worst concise thing like the two concise the thing that is way too concise
00:13:42 What Ben would tell us a story and cuts out all the interesting parts of it and just tells you the facts
00:13:47 I went here. I fuck this dude. I went home done
00:13:54 Story was definitely too concise
00:13:58 Yeah, I mean it's just that
00:14:04 I was gonna say like going off of what Nate said if we're gonna talk about how we are concise
00:14:09 Or do you want to talk first about art or about analysis because I think if there's a fan at home of the PCP
00:14:14 They're probably high school or college age. They have to write a lot of essays and what's scary about being
00:14:20 Concise is in an essay as you usually have, you know, you have to do eight pages
00:14:24 So how can you be both concise and stretch that shit out to eight pages just worry about you guys have
00:14:29 To teach you to do is just to learn is just to get the basic discipline of typing shit out
00:14:34 It's only when you get into college that they start telling you to actually how to write good school
00:14:38 Well, that's school. Yeah, I would say your system of this world only once you have base level mediocre confidence by the time
00:14:44 You're 18 and maybe if you work really hard and put all of your future life savings and do this degree
00:14:50 Then you can be decent in your life. I'll tell you I'll tell you to do like well
00:14:55 You know, I because I learned how to be concise because of an English teacher
00:14:59 but I was taking a
00:15:01 Like that class was to learn how to be a better writer and most college classes won't teach you that
00:15:06 They want you to learn how to write a college paper, which means pumping in as much frivolous bullshit
00:15:13 It's humanly possible to reach 50,000 words like if you look at like cider
00:15:18 talking about his thesis like
00:15:20 Like you you inherently through working your way up through school. You will learn how to bullshit
00:15:25 You will learn how to stretch things out. I learned how to do that back in high school
00:15:28 And here's my advice if all they give you is a minimum word count
00:15:34 Don't try to be concise ever if they try if they give you a minimum word count
00:15:38 Write as many fucking like as many ways of saying the exact same shit as you can to reach that word Jesse
00:15:43 What the fuck are those clicking noises? I'm hearing in the background. What are you doing? What is that? It's Jesse here
00:15:48 Yeah, that's I see I am also in this episode everyone
00:15:51 Yeah, I wasn't going to say anything, but Nate revealed your mic, so we don't hear you chewing
00:15:58 It sounds like you're eating tic-tacs. It sounds like you're just down in tic-tacs. I'm fucking around with shit
00:16:04 Jesse's always done that. Welcome to the Procrastinator's podcast. He's always like flipping a screw around into other screws on his desk
00:16:12 We're just doing that. I don't know what the shit all the time. It's white noise
00:16:15 I'm fucking building infiltration tools. I'm fucking living Persona 5. That's what I do
00:16:21 I stay at my desk and I create tools to infiltrate people's palaces
00:16:26 Hey, I think you're the only person. I know who's played Persona 5. Is it good? How you how's it going?
00:16:30 It is good. It's pretty okay. That's a topic now. That's a
00:16:37 It could be
00:16:39 It could be except that you're the only
00:16:42 My favorite Persona is when in Apescape 3 you can turn into a knight. That's my favorite one
00:16:48 Yeah, so talking about before we
00:16:51 Saying if they give you a minimum word count, you should be as civil as is possible
00:16:55 Yeah, if they give you a minimum word count and no maximum go apeshit if they give you a maximum word count
00:17:00 That's where you guys start worrying about it because that's why I learned to be concise as I had gotten so used to trying to pump as many words
00:17:06 Into a paper as possible and just like writing, you know
00:17:10 My life have I ever had a maximum word count? I think that could be why I'm such a fucking ridiculously
00:17:15 Yeah, this never cut my words down. This teacher. I had he told us to write a story about a
00:17:22 What was it? It was like write a story about a some a teacher who you learned something from or something some shit
00:17:27 Oh, he's just trying to beat himself off everybody right about me. This was like brand
00:17:31 We just this first paper way to write for the class and it was something like that. I know that's what I wrote about
00:17:35 I don't know if that's what the topic was but he said like
00:17:38 700 to a thousand words and I wrote like 1300 and I turned and I'm thinking like ha I am I surpassed your word count
00:17:46 But he like yeah, I'm even better. I know a thousand words. That's nothing to me
00:17:50 And he's like no I wanted this to be
00:17:52 700 to a thousand like you went over you need to go through this and like simplify it and so I took out a bunch of words
00:17:59 I got it down to like just over a thousand and he reads it
00:18:02 He's like there's still a lot of stuff in here like like he points out some stuff
00:18:05 That's like unnecessary and I was like yeah now that I think about that is unnecessary and I work it down to like
00:18:10 700 words and it was like a tight little piece. It was much better like I'm reading over it
00:18:15 And I'm like wow my original fucking blue because I didn't do I didn't try to control myself ever ever ever go to school
00:18:23 So yeah, like the whole conciseness thing there's not like any like it's not like some sort of magic different way that things can
00:18:29 Be good or bad. It's just a different lens of how to approach
00:18:33 Removing things that are not good and adding only things that are good, you know
00:18:38 I think that that's I feel like that's part of what makes
00:18:40 Cartoons Western cartoons better now than they were like in the previous era
00:18:45 Where a lot of cartoons would just have a lot of episodes that don't matter much, but then you see the universe
00:18:50 But then you see oh no, no, I'm talking about you doing it backwards
00:18:56 All right, listen for a couple of minutes you have to all agree with me for the point to be made so
00:19:02 Like adventure time it feels like they're really trying to make only awesome stuff happen
00:19:06 Whereas I honestly feel like when I look at a lot of older shows they're like well
00:19:10 I guess this episode something just kind of okay will happen. They're just really
00:19:16 Man masters of the universe kind of just yeah, just just make only the cool stuff happen
00:19:21 Just try to cheat, you know, just just make a dessert. That's nothing but chocolate and vanilla
00:19:25 You know, not every guy tune has like a continuous storyline and character progression and shit
00:19:30 Like sometimes you just want to see SpongeBob hang out at the Krabby pad. Yeah, but do the best ones of that hang out at the Krabby pad
00:19:37 Yeah
00:19:49 Yeah, no, I totally agree with DeVue on that point because that's what I've always struggled with but like a lot of longer shows is like
00:19:57 For instance, Ranma one half as you brought up earlier as a show. That's not at all concise
00:20:02 There's just so much fucking wasted time in that show. It's a hundred and sixty episodes
00:20:07 And like the first like 20 tell this really like compelling
00:20:13 Romance story and then the last like like like throughout the show. There's about 60 episodes that are like great
00:20:20 Out of a hundred and sixty, which is pretty good
00:20:22 There's about 96 that like you like should watch and there's about 60 that you just shouldn't you know and like you have a
00:20:31 Actual posts
00:20:35 Yeah, I'm watching guide for Ranma like it's like, you know, here's like the minimum you should watch
00:20:40 Here's like each different tier of episodes essentially and the ones that you shouldn't watch
00:20:44 It's because they just boil it down to like the basically flander eyes the characters a perfect example
00:20:50 Is the second Ramo and half movie which is fucking dog shit and it like all the movie consists of is the most
00:20:58 Basic idea of what each character is like just using the most obnoxious running gags
00:21:03 Like the movie effect because movies are always afraid to like challenge the status quo
00:21:06 So there will be no development in a lot of movies like that and and just not even doing anything with the characters
00:21:12 Cuz like the best episodes of the show are where you see them change a little bit or you see some kind of small
00:21:18 Insight into who they are whereas the worst episodes are when they're just being like again
00:21:23 Flander eyes like just like what what is this character known for oh?
00:21:26 She she always she always trips and falls in the main character and calls him a baka Inu
00:21:31 You know like that's that's something that has to happen every episode so then you get a movie and it's just that yeah
00:21:36 It's just and it did it with like every character in the show, which there's a huge cast kind of a complete waste of time
00:21:42 I mean help fucking SpongeBob does the same thing the first three seasons have like say let's say 20 ideas
00:21:46 And then it's been like 50 seasons now and they're still just cycling through the same ideas for some reason
00:21:51 I just realized okay, but Spongebob's a little intro to this episode should be the the preparing the Krabby Patty dramatic intro thing
00:21:58 Cuz that's very unconcise. It's like just making you sit around but that's the point
00:22:02 That's like anti-humor. I know it's great. That should be the intro just saying guys, okay, okay
00:22:08 Tell that to whoever edits this see whoever at Ben I guess oh
00:22:13 Okay, there you go you and Ben are really fighting over this editing spot. This is good challenge Ben make Ben into a real boy
00:22:19 Please make him work for something in his life
00:22:23 Yeah, okay, cool, but I do like it though
00:22:26 Well, I think there's a place for shows like Spongebob that I mean they don't challenge their status quo at all like but they're completely focused on
00:22:33 Being you know sort of consumable pop entertainment that just brings you I don't know like there's you're not learning anything watching a
00:22:41 11 minutes of the episode rather than like a season-long story arc. Yeah, so it's not really comparable to like
00:22:48 I do think it's comparable and I mean like do you think it is?
00:22:51 I mean Ramo and half is the same story like it doesn't it doesn't really have an ongoing plot
00:22:56 It's that Ramo mixes in like that that character development stuff because there is like a thing
00:23:00 We're we're waiting for like relationship
00:23:04 16 episodes of Ramo is all the development in the show like after episode 16
00:23:08 It just cuts off and like because the development that happens supposedly it's just the same thing over and over again
00:23:15 It's just the characters
00:23:16 Realizing that oh, maybe we do love each other, but then it goes back to status. I mean I'm not as familiar with with Ramo
00:23:21 But here's a better example
00:23:23 Future Rama like there's certain episodes. We all remember a future Rama either because they're the really dramatic ones
00:23:29 Or they're the ones that are so hilarious and like over the top with their concept and really did something unique and interesting
00:23:34 but there's other episodes of future Rama that are just like
00:23:37 Just whatever dick around like do the same thing we've done in a million other episodes and like no one remembers those ones
00:23:43 I think you know those some people are annoyed by those
00:23:46 I love almost everything about future Rama and I think it's because again
00:23:50 It has a more comedic tone and it can get away like you're never gonna be super disappointed when there's just a future Rama episode
00:23:57 That's just if it's just hilarious
00:23:59 I mean even the baseline of the show is pretty good and like a show that I think is
00:24:04 Very close to all killer no filler is Rick and Morty right where like, you know, we've got two two seasons and
00:24:11 There's like maybe three episodes that I would be like, I don't know if I want to watch that one if I was Marathon
00:24:17 I don't even know if I go that high. I don't think there are any I'd love them all
00:24:19 I mean, I will rewatch all of them right right for sure
00:24:22 But like there's a couple that aren't as good as the other like raising gazorp is or not as many people are gonna watch that
00:24:27 Yeah, again, you know
00:24:29 But like so much of it is so strong because they really do approach every episode with like let's come up with another
00:24:35 Crazy-ass idea like let's always have it so it's something you never thought of that's always gonna be like a little bit of a mind
00:24:41 Blow even when it like repeats like, you know, the the whole marriage between
00:24:46 Jerry and
00:24:47 What's the name?
00:24:49 Yes, like Jerry and Beth's marriage has been it's it's kind of beating a dead horse at this point
00:24:54 That's true, but they still find new things to do with it, you know, so like even though it's kind of status Khloe
00:25:00 It's still like by the end of the episode you'll be like, okay, I guess you earned that one
00:25:04 How specifically are you relating this to being concise?
00:25:08 Well, just that I think that
00:25:09 Consciousness is about presenting new ideas like like like each I think it to repeat the same thing
00:25:16 You already said is to not be concise and like you can draw a parallel between this in like an analytical video where it's more
00:25:22 Immediate and in a long-form TV show
00:25:24 Does a long-ass intro to the video is like this show came out in 1994 and it's pretty good
00:25:29 Even that stuff's not so much a problem. It's when they say like
00:25:32 When I first watched this yeah, I didn't think it was good to be good
00:25:36 But then after watching it it turns out it was literally filler
00:25:39 You can literally just like the show the show is good. Yeah, and I did this in um, I
00:25:44 Showed there's a video of how I edited the writing for my Kemono friends video because the original opening sentence was like
00:25:51 Like if you just want to know whether or not I think this show is good
00:25:56 The answer to that is that yes, it is good, right?
00:25:58 And so I cut all that out and wrote Kemono friends is good
00:26:02 That's the edited version and it literally conveys the exact same meaning. Yeah, like it doesn't add or subtract anything
00:26:08 It's just the same sentence, but with way fewer words
00:26:12 I remember digi there was a time when you used to edit out
00:26:17 Literally every single gap between any words you said, you know any any any breasts that you you would cut them out
00:26:24 And you would delete them back in and yeah, because it became so dense with information that people
00:26:30 I mean, I'm not sure people had problems with it, but I did it was a bit. I still do that
00:26:35 Um, I just did it recently because I just uploaded a a big long ranting rambly podcast about Pirates of the Caribbean 5
00:26:42 Yeah, and um, you know when you're recording it
00:26:46 It's all coming off the top of your head and you're going on and on right, but I
00:26:51 Definitely I went through meticulously and shortened the breaths and put the sentences to each other like almost
00:26:59 Imperceptibly like just like you know like half a second closer to each other
00:27:03 But when it's an entire podcast and you're doing that between every sentence
00:27:07 You might shave off a good like half an hour of redundancy of just listening to me like breathing between sentences
00:27:14 And to be clear I mean I still cut out all breaths and all everything
00:27:17 It's just that what hippos referring to is if you watch my old pony videos the words literally run into each other
00:27:23 Like a sentence. There is no space
00:27:25 It will be like like one word finishes and like I would edit it that way
00:27:29 I would edit it so the words literally ran into each other and it's actually headache inducing to listen to like like when the videos
00:27:35 were like 15 minutes long and it was all like that and I'd be going between different points with no transition or anything
00:27:42 And so it was like it was hard to process even for me like I'd listen to it back and be like getting a headache
00:27:49 So I actually had an effect sometimes where I would feel suffocated
00:27:52 Because I don't hear any space to breathe and it's like it tricks my mind and like yeah
00:27:57 Like it fucked with me
00:27:58 I would actually feel like like loss of breath listening to some of this episode's back
00:28:01 I can't get another review show that does that's always done that to spectacular effect named that zero punctuation named after the gimmick
00:28:08 Yeah, and you know he just writes it around that gimmick
00:28:12 It's like almost ever the whole almost every video is like ten seconds of a point ten seconds of a joke
00:28:18 And it it's like peanut butter and jelly is from one to the other constantly
00:28:21 So you're you can generally I think the fact that those are only five minutes long helps
00:28:25 Yeah, you can generally get all the point if you just just just empathize with your audience all the time
00:28:31 That's sort of a higher level skill in any art medium thing is being able to constantly
00:28:36 Simulate what it's gonna feel like to the person who this is for watching
00:28:41 You know who didn't do that in a in a big way
00:28:43 I didn't when I was making my Lucifer video that video was not it was
00:28:49 Concise there you go. Yeah for sure dense with too much information that I when I was editing it in slow motion
00:28:54 I thought okay everyone's gonna be able to get this gonna be able to read it. No problem and
00:28:58 Yeah, that's that's the problem
00:29:00 I've always had with with edit like editors that you know the extra credits guys still do this
00:29:06 Occasionally which really annoys me because I used to do it and I realized it was terrible is to have like a pun image on the screen
00:29:13 Yeah, which relates to like a single word in a sentence and then you know the viewer is then looking at this image thinking wait
00:29:20 What's that got to do with it? Oh, I see and then they've missed like the rest of the sentence in the style the next one
00:29:25 I've done some of that and and not liked it in the long run as well
00:29:30 Extra craze is fucking dog shit. I hate them on every level imaginable
00:29:34 Anyway, when it when it comes to to making my own things concise
00:29:39 I find it very difficult to imagine
00:29:42 Like when when the writing is bad
00:29:45 Until I've recorded it and I'm listening to it and I'm like, okay that sentence is stupid
00:29:49 I can cut that out because it doesn't sound right. It sounds like what I just said, so I can't read it very well
00:29:54 I'm not like a word guy, but when I'm listening to it
00:29:57 That's when I usually cut down all the all the the the extra crap. I'm the same way give I do it the same way
00:30:03 I think perhaps the most important part of the writing process is to have somebody else read your work and tell you
00:30:08 Uh, yeah, you made this point like three paragraphs ago. Do you do you do that? I think you've talked about doing that
00:30:13 Mom definitely all of my videos I do for my main channel
00:30:16 I have one of my friends like Asperger or somebody read through it and that kind of thing
00:30:20 It's really have friends who are actually good who could actually I feel like 90% of people listening are gonna have friends who
00:30:28 Have no talent in this kind of thing at all and will never be good at all and so well
00:30:33 I think anybody can read something. Yeah, it's it's I don't think it's necessarily you have to be
00:30:38 You know a linguist or whatever to know that something is not concise if you just read it
00:30:43 And you're like I don't get this part that's it's weird and stupid
00:30:46 You know that's just what the viewer will think when they're listening to it
00:30:49 And did you bro has told me that in private?
00:30:52 He told me he loves it when fans send him work that they wrote and he loves to edit it for them and send it back
00:30:58 Oh, right
00:30:59 That you know, that's interesting because I I think I have a different mentality about it
00:31:03 And it's I'm probably not any better, but I have this weird
00:31:07 Fetishistic desire to be independent in everything I do or like have control over everything so I never ask anyone for help
00:31:13 Well, you can always tell them
00:31:16 With what they said like oh, yeah, I see your point
00:31:20 It's like an attitude where I don't want to ever have to rely on anyone's feedback ever
00:31:24 I want all the skills to be contained within me, but whatever. I mean, that's just small thing
00:31:28 I got it
00:31:29 I mean you can learn the skills by having some sorry give
00:31:33 Like if you know if you have a friend who can teach you those things and then you eventually learn it from them
00:31:38 Then you will have the skill for yourself
00:31:40 Well, like I mean, okay, that makes sense
00:31:42 But to me the way to do that is to make the video all the way and like if there's problems with it
00:31:46 Okay, I'll fix it the next round. Well, yeah, I would do that, too
00:31:48 I wouldn't I wouldn't give them like one paragraph and be like is this okay
00:31:52 I'd I'd give them the whole thing and be like what am I gonna do like I mean
00:31:56 I what am I gonna do like send you my scripts and be like digi is this concise tell me what do you think I don't want to do
00:32:01 What's wrong with that? Why are you proposing it like it's crazy? Well, that's a great thing to do
00:32:05 I guess cuz that cuz then it's not just mine anymore than someone else has done right like I know I've checked scripts for some of you
00:32:12 Not me nigga before but I don't know who I think I made hippo check one of mine one time
00:32:16 I know I've checked hippo stuff on his blog before incidentally any you guys could send me one
00:32:21 I'd be happy to do it if you ever want
00:32:24 The thing about that
00:32:26 I was gonna talk about is I don't like
00:32:29 Like the idea of giving anyone an entire script because then all my jokes are spoiled and especially any of you guys
00:32:35 I don't want you guys to to see my script and see what I'm going for and then you know not be surprised and laugh at a joke
00:32:42 I mean you don't laugh, but it's just I like keeping cool things to surprise and I don't really usually like asking for help for that reason
00:32:51 But it's spoiling it for one person to make it better for thousands, so he's got to get around that mental block
00:32:58 But then again, I really care much more about what you guys think of my content than any of my audience for sure
00:33:04 Of course. No, you're all
00:33:05 Okay, I don't I don't know that I would
00:33:11 Trust any of you guys or anyone at all sure like proofread
00:33:16 Like a YouTube video that I'm writing like if I'm writing a book or a novel then yeah
00:33:21 I'm gonna look for an editor or someone who knows about books and novels
00:33:25 But if I'm writing an endless Jess YouTube video nobody gets to fucking touch it, but me
00:33:30 I don't think anybody needs to touch yours because yours are perfect. Well, you know to be fair
00:33:36 You know Jesse is not as my only one like him to be and there are I'm sure there are some changes that Jesse could make or any of
00:33:43 Us could make. Oh, no, um, the thing is what Nate was saying is that we want it to be our own thing
00:33:50 So if we make a mistake, we want to we want to personally learn from that
00:33:53 And I guess asking for help if you have like a very specific
00:33:56 Like question like like sometimes I come into the chat saying I can't think of a word that means this because I just need a word
00:34:02 I need a word that describes something. Well, and yeah
00:34:08 Direct advice from people is not the right idea 95% of the time unless you are like just just
00:34:13 Starting out because really the best thing to do is just make it and then sense
00:34:18 Clues and tells and signs and subtleties from the reaction that people get like digi all the time
00:34:25 Well explain how he tools his videos to cater to the way that people are reacting
00:34:30 But scarcely does that come in the form of just doing what people say they want it comes in the form of analyzing their reaction
00:34:36 And coming to new conclusions that they didn't even realize
00:34:39 That that comes down to a lot of the the classic. What was it prego sauce? Oh, yeah
00:34:47 It's a principal in economics about pasta sauce about how
00:34:52 Like basically they were trying to find new ways to make pasta sauce and they like asked people what what should we do?
00:34:59 And people gave suggestions and those didn't sell it all instead
00:35:02 They just made stuff up and gave it to an audience and the audience ended up liking it
00:35:07 And it just goes to show how the audience does not know what they of course, of course
00:35:11 Like they know whether they like it or not, but they don't know what they want it to be
00:35:15 You're slightly confusing. I am jimquisition videos. He has one about pasta sauce about I don't know if I've seen either
00:35:21 Then he has the other one about he has the other one about coffee
00:35:24 Where in focus group testing if you do a forum if you give people you ask people directly what kind of coffee they want
00:35:31 They over well money say they want a rich dark roast because that makes you sound cool
00:35:36 But then if you actually observe buying habits people usually like a shitload of ice and milk and cream
00:35:41 Yeah, they like weak-ass water down shit
00:35:43 So like when I I mean I will all the time ask people like hey
00:35:47 What should I make a video about or something like that?
00:35:49 But I never do anything that suggested to me like I'll ask I'll ask like all the time
00:35:55 Like I'll go on Twitter and do like polls or like ask people and then not do any of it and and instead
00:36:02 What I'm really trying to get is more of like just a sense of what people think I do right, you know like almost like
00:36:11 Yeah
00:36:11 Understanding the nuances of what makes art good is sort of what we all specialize in and monkey parodies us for thinking
00:36:18 We're so good at specializing in because
00:36:21 Yeah, like you know, I've experienced this make a fucking video like hey guys. Here's this game
00:36:26 It's called Undertale and here's five reasons why it's good and then everyone's like that's not why it's good
00:36:30 It's good because good characters and the good music
00:36:34 It's got good music. I mean that's why I know that people don't know shit
00:36:39 What my audience thinks they want from me is like go take
00:36:43 Like just make another video about the next episode of Evangelion, you know like oh there's got it
00:36:49 You talked about the first nine
00:36:50 There's got to be just as much to say about episode 10 or like take FLCL and break it down
00:36:56 We know there's a lot to say about FLCL because of course there is you know, but like well
00:37:02 Is that what is that actually going to be what they want when I make it? You know, is it or am I going to go?
00:37:08 definitely like
00:37:09 judging by
00:37:11 Like a YouTube comments. It's clear that
00:37:14 Nobody knows how to scrutinize my work correctly
00:37:17 They all do it wrong. So I definitely and I think that is not just applying to me
00:37:22 I think that probably applies to most people
00:37:24 I think that you should definitely cultivate the ability to scrutinize your own work
00:37:29 Before you like you shouldn't have you shouldn't depend
00:37:34 That is true
00:37:35 That is true, but you are in the entertainment business
00:37:37 So if people are not appreciating on a high on a large enough scale at some point the responsibility does fall to you
00:37:44 Right, but what he's saying is that you don't listen to what they say is wrong with it
00:37:48 Oh, of course, right. They don't know anything about like I mean like I feel like when I'm going over my own writing and I'm you know
00:37:55 Editing it and taking out redundancies to make it into a video mode
00:38:00 I mean, I might make mistakes and as few redundancies might get by me even
00:38:05 But I would almost rather have my mistakes left in it than have someone else fix it and have their stamp on it
00:38:14 Yeah, you know like whenever I've made like a mistake
00:38:17 I would rather if I if I make like an mistake early on and like I say a word wrong
00:38:23 I'd rather use that as an opportunity to do a silly editing thing to show how fallible I am like something
00:38:29 Anything to make it like more like, you know, I would just work with what I have even if I made it
00:38:36 Yeah, in the event that someone gives you constructive criticism and it actually
00:38:40 Works it actually makes sense on its face then follow it in the event that happens
00:38:46 You know whole time. I was making videos Digi was the only one who ever gave me like constructive criticism that like made sense
00:38:52 And was correct and even then I always told him that he's wrong just for artistic integrity reasons
00:38:57 And then just silently fix the problems later. Oh
00:39:01 You've all done that to me. So it's fine. Don't worry
00:39:04 And I don't worry. This is how it's supposed to be. It's never said like oh, I changed my titles and thumbnails
00:39:10 explicitly because you told me to 500 times
00:39:17 One time
00:39:19 But I well, it's yeah, but I mean it's not like we talked about it behind your back
00:39:24 Give me a second here. It's not like DaVinci tells me Nate. Do something
00:39:35 I am the DaVinci of YouTube
00:39:39 Everybody at home
00:39:41 Hypothetically if you happen to not be a youtuber and maybe you're like a kid writing an essay
00:39:46 Don't be afraid to show it to people and get advice. We're not yeah, not all YouTube writers like we
00:39:50 Yeah, and I want to bring up like it's well. It's funny that no
00:39:54 We're not moving away until I clarify that it's not that Digi tells me something and I do it
00:39:58 It's that I have I saw the signs were all pointing that was me that was all me
00:40:03 I was explicitly saying to everyone guys, but I've done the research. I know the results
00:40:08 I don't do this. It's not like I'm there looking at your full month study. It's just a guy tell me what all right
00:40:13 Well, okay. I anyway made a realization. Okay, it's funny to me because Nate and Jesse and hippo are all very much like
00:40:22 Suggesting like I want it to be my product and like my it's it's all me and I don't want somebody else to like affect it
00:40:28 Yeah, I feel the total opposite. I will
00:40:31 Freely allow anybody's mark to be made on my video
00:40:35 I mean I blatantly copy other people's styles and tell like say so I do videos that other people suggested just recently I did
00:40:42 Why I dropped every anime I dropped because some guy on Twitter said it would be a good idea and I was like, hey
00:40:47 Yeah, let's do that and but the biggest way because I have to do edit my videos and I give him literally full rate like free range
00:40:54 You can do whatever the fuck he wants. I don't yeah, but I think the thing about that is that, you know
00:41:00 I will for me anyway is that a lot of the the comedy has to be like coming from me
00:41:06 Like if I think it's funny
00:41:07 It'll be like a thing like either I edit or I say it that way or like, you know
00:41:13 It's a different type of video too, you know
00:41:14 It's it's a different it's a different process because sure but like I mean I like
00:41:20 A lot of what happens in my videos now is just not my ideas or comedy
00:41:24 It's just devues and I like it more than what I would have come up with like yeah
00:41:28 But there's also the case that if I had if I say if I had an editor
00:41:33 He might do stuff that is worse than what I would have come up with and I would have to teach him at that point
00:41:37 Because like I know I'm very funny when it comes to things
00:41:41 Did you did you put in the time and you know, you know, the diva has been fully vetted at this point
00:41:45 So yeah, I mean if I had if I had a diva maybe but I don't have a diva. There's only one
00:41:50 I could be your diva tonight mom and dad will never know
00:41:55 I mean, I just yeah, like I constantly get offers of people
00:41:59 Why too sorry, did you know I constantly get offers of people
00:42:04 Like hippo said of like offering to edit my videos for me
00:42:07 You're like, you know, just decrease some of my workload and get more of my stuff out there, right, but like
00:42:13 If I have to train someone to edit the way that I would edit then that's like would take up just as much time
00:42:21 And be just as redundant as me editing it myself
00:42:23 It's a business cost, you know, like I when I was working on the galco video with this this new guy snooping turtle who is great
00:42:29 He's wonderful. Like I put out a Twitter like hey, I'm looking for a new editor
00:42:32 He was one of the guys who responded I checked out everybody's work his I like the best
00:42:35 So we ended up working together and you know, like we it took time like we went through and we went through the whole rigamarole
00:42:41 Of like going through like every bit submitting to me for approval. Okay, we'd work on in the next part submit that okay
00:42:45 These sorts of changes need to be worked in I need to do some editing and then stick it in and send it back
00:42:49 And but like I was willing to do all that not because it was super efficient at the time
00:42:53 But because I see a future relationship where we're doing more work together faster more efficiently better
00:42:58 And he's certainly he was interested in that and hopefully he still is hopefully hasn't changed his mind
00:43:04 So yeah, it's it's like an investment a sort of long-term investment
00:43:07 I'm much more interested in personally is
00:43:11 Trying to to make it so that I can get away with the least editing possible if you watch my my demon souls review that I made
00:43:18 It's basically it's there's nothing I put a few gifts on I put some video game footage that I recorded in a live stream
00:43:25 I liked your skeleton boys. They were yeah
00:43:28 And that was it. I just put relevant clips in and it was great and people's really like that because it you know
00:43:34 I didn't need to do
00:43:39 What just that that that one very simple
00:43:43 Editing choice right at the beginning of just having the skeleton gifts with the trombones along with the music
00:43:49 Those are trumpets you buffoon
00:43:51 Trumpets whatever
00:43:55 It's trombones because they're skeletons you assie. Oh
00:44:00 Jess to go back to the last point you made
00:44:03 You don't want somebody else to edit your stuff
00:44:05 I know I know there was some talk in this chat about having one of us help out edit the plebe in the weeb
00:44:10 Like what did you decide on that? Do you still think like you are the only one who can do that? Yeah, that's um
00:44:16 Well now it's well like in my mind the plebe in the weeb at this point has morphed into like another
00:44:22 Aspect of the endless Jess grand narrative. So now no one can fucking touch it. Oh now it's trapped in my brain
00:44:28 It is there is one episode that we had talked about having Nate edit for reasons that will become apparent when the episode
00:44:35 but like releases
00:44:37 the um
00:44:38 Yeah, like everyone I started to hear the rumblings like five months in like where the fuck are these episodes?
00:44:45 Yeah, and um
00:44:47 So the only reason you didn't hear the rumblings earlier is because people keep asking me instead of you
00:44:52 I guess but then they found out I didn't communicate well enough that Jesse was editing it
00:44:57 So everyone would just ask me where is the plebe in the weeb all the time
00:45:00 And I really love the clear I don't say as Jesse the artistic vision conveyed in the editing
00:45:04 It's so like it's all from Jesse's perspective and he just doesn't give a fuck. That's what's great. It's really great
00:45:09 It's really yeah, like that's the that's the reason because it's like how can I explain that idea to like an editor and have it
00:45:15 Make any sense like it can only be like how do I like how do I sit down the guy and be like, okay?
00:45:20 This this is not or this is not an anime talk show
00:45:24 This is a show about me ruining an anime talk show because I don't want to be there and it's all from my perspective and
00:45:30 When they talk about time slowing down
00:45:32 You're gonna slow time down and go into my brain and look at the French Revolution
00:45:36 Set to the music from cross and which was an anime that came out two years ago that nobody in the world watched
00:45:41 And also every time that Jeff coughs, I want you to zoom in on him coughing for no reason at all
00:45:48 To be an extended ten minute section at the end where everything that did you saying about directing an anime is
00:45:54 Reflected in like weird like filters on the screen and his head gets fucking stupid and weird when he says the word off-model and shit
00:46:02 Like I can't possibly it's someone down and explain it would be it would take longer than editing it myself
00:46:10 But that's a very visionary video, and I'm sure you could have likes like smaller shit that you could pass along
00:46:16 You know like it's funny for me because of my most like my big videos like the main channel
00:46:23 Highly edited stuff is the one I want out of my hands and in devues
00:46:27 Whereas the stuff that like I couldn't possibly give to him that like I have to put my creative stamp on would be like
00:46:33 Insomnia analysis because it's so fucking weird like my even I don't fully understand my intentions with it
00:46:40 But it has to be me because how could anyone possibly know like I mean I'd just be giving you like a bunch of
00:46:46 Completely meaningless footage and being like do something with this
00:46:50 It's like how do you know which rap song matches best with the emotion that's on my face in this granted this clip
00:46:56 Yeah, I mean that's entirely true
00:46:57 There's definitely projects that are for you and you alone to do but like I mean the reality still exists
00:47:02 Of course that there are plenty of projects that you can have other people do right like galco and one punch man
00:47:08 Like you didn't edit those those I just wrote the scripts
00:47:10 And I thought you know what these are cool and all but I don't really give that much of a shit about the things that I brought
00:47:16 Even though I you know those are all at the time. I thought hey
00:47:18 These are really cool thoughts. I want to tell a story about or whatever and but yeah
00:47:21 I was happy to pass them off to give somebody else to edit and came out good
00:47:24 Wow, this should have a lot to do with the topic conciseness. Yeah, well, I mean a conciseness
00:47:30 But the workflow that the thing about writing concisely is that it's not a topic you could talk about for an hour
00:47:36 I want to ask everybody like do you guys have any specific things that videos do that waste time that isn't hey guys?
00:47:43 Sorry, I haven't made a video in a while and also when I thought the show was gonna come out
00:47:48 I thought it was gonna be this but it turned out to be that any other specific things that you feel waste your time
00:47:53 I mean, it's just constant what I see in like especially analysis videos is constant redundancy and just
00:48:00 Saying the same thing three different ways and not seeming to realize that you're doing yeah, you know like hey guys
00:48:05 It's RC anime and like it's RC anime. Hi guys and guys. Hey, it's RC anime. Just stop it
00:48:11 We got the first you know like I remember going into making videos because I've always felt that making a point
00:48:17 Concisely is a thing like even back when I made videos in like 2008
00:48:21 I'm like I hated when people were like hi everybody. Hey guys. I never I've never started a video with hey guys
00:48:28 Sometimes I started a video with hello as dramatically as possible when I feel it's necessary
00:48:33 So I've always had a I've always been a stickler for not wasting time
00:48:36 I feel the same way about that specific thing. I always was like if you have to say hello get out, you know
00:48:44 But you know over time people have said well, I mean, you know, it's fine. It's good and it's good and it's fine
00:48:50 I'm like, I guess I guess it is good and it's fine and and sometimes I do it
00:48:55 I just you know when I'm recording
00:48:57 You know that guitar whole video or vlog right?
00:49:00 Sometimes I don't start with the point because I don't know what I'm doing. I'm just saying the fucking
00:49:05 Correctly, there's one video of yours where you're like this game is just
00:49:09 good
00:49:12 Capulary what's that?
00:49:14 My favorite of all time is hippo's line
00:49:18 It's got level design and like that was
00:49:24 Yeah, almost like any kind of setup at all is sort of
00:49:29 counterintuitive to
00:49:31 Like the the YouTube format as a medium like
00:49:36 Like in like in skits, for example, like you have a like a wacky character
00:49:42 showing up and
00:49:44 Something happens. You're having a conversation with like a cult corona and like
00:49:49 I like
00:49:51 Looking at it like as though it were like a movie or a TV show like
00:49:55 Screenwriting tells you that like there should like this this conversation needs to make sense
00:50:00 Yeah, yeah, and like the sentences need to flow together
00:50:03 But in a YouTube video that just makes it like long and take away from the point of the video and just boring and redundant
00:50:10 and what and what I eventually came to learn is to
00:50:14 Harness the inherent like popcorn II stupid stupidity of YouTube. So like
00:50:20 Cold corona doesn't need to come in and say this is why I'm here and this is what we're going to talk about
00:50:25 I can just like throw him in as a complete non sequitur for no reason but and just get to the goddamn joke
00:50:37 Tar like as in a centaur sequitur, what? Oh
00:50:42 Boy, oh boy
00:50:44 So as I was saying, you know, you can go into videos of going I'm gonna be concise
00:50:48 Well, I don't know if what I said made it's not necessarily easy
00:50:51 So when I started making videos like trying to do it professionally and all right what I'd come into is wow
00:50:57 I have this like interesting point to make how the fuck do I make it concisely?
00:51:00 So a lot of times I just didn't it took me like three paragraphs
00:51:05 But I could have written it in one paragraph
00:51:07 But I didn't know how to make that paragraph and what I there was one video in particular where I was talking about gravity falls
00:51:14 And shit and I was just like at the point. I was trying to make I felt like I needed
00:51:19 I needed three paragraphs to make the point because like
00:51:23 Basically, the first paragraph has the first 30% of the point then the second paragraph has the second 30% of the point and so on
00:51:30 But in order for those paragraphs to even make sense in the English language
00:51:34 I had to keep repeating the first percentages over and over again and just weaving more in each time
00:51:39 It's just it's just hard. It just takes a lot of legwork
00:51:41 You just have to listen to mr. B tongue videos on repeat every day. Yeah, I want to get into why I think it happens shit
00:51:48 And I'll also say of what Jesse was saying about cold corona like if you want to everyone should emulate
00:51:55 The existence of Cal Chuchesta as a side character in videos because you can watch any needle drop video and he never
00:52:02 Explains what the fuck Cal Chuchesta is he just shows up and says some weird shit in in like 30% of his videos
00:52:09 And you just kind of have to either know the lore of the channel or like you're just gonna go
00:52:15 Okay, well, I don't know what that was about, but it was funny, you know like
00:52:19 Because who cares what it actually is absent what who the fuck cares
00:52:23 But um the reason I think it happens where people repeat themselves so much is that
00:52:28 They feel like this point needs more weight than the amount of words
00:52:33 They can use for it and this happens to me a lot
00:52:35 Um and the biggest place I see this happening in anime analysis in particular is when trying to describe visuals
00:52:41 People will always say like the visuals of this show are really incredible
00:52:45 But they don't know how to explain that in more depth
00:52:48 So they say like the animation is really great the color design is really great
00:52:53 Yeah, the the way that things flow together is really great and they're basically just emphasizing again and again the point
00:52:58 They made already the visuals are really great
00:53:00 And it's cuz like
00:53:01 Unless you can pick apart like one moment to really dig into that then it's hard to
00:53:08 To describe that in broad terms, but there it's like you've got something in your brain
00:53:11 That's like no I have to make sure they understand they have to know how great the visuals are
00:53:17 This can't just be a flippant one-off point in the video
00:53:19 But you end up just repeating yourself ad nauseam and an example and like not to throw shade at this guy
00:53:25 Cuz I love him, but super eyepatch will just had a video about the newest season of samurai Jack
00:53:30 And he kind of does that with the visuals where he talks about it for like three minutes
00:53:35 Basically just emphasizing again and again how good the show looks and like the on-screen footage is doing all the leg work as it is
00:53:41 He didn't need to say anything. That's really the point that he's just trying to fill time so we can show you slides
00:53:45 It could very well be but like it obviously it doesn't that could be effective
00:53:50 But just make an AMV put an AMV in the middle of your video that'll do enough
00:53:55 Emphasizing one point over another doesn't can't just be made through the amount of words used it can be done through the tone of the words used like
00:54:01 Yeah, you know the character designers are fine
00:54:04 You know the locations are fine, but that mother fucking knows on the main character. So goddamn shoot moving on right
00:54:11 Forget that swears exist for emphasis. So that's why I like to use them to make things look
00:54:17 Yeah, I was actually just thinking about that from Homestuck after pages and pages probably novels worth of chat logs
00:54:23 There's one moment where the way that you read the chat log is slightly different to really emphasize an important sentence
00:54:28 And like obviously super eyepatch wolf does this because for him the most important thing is to say the title of the video
00:54:35 He's like why as dramatically as you should watch
00:54:41 Show
00:54:45 That shit cracks me up every time but like um, I think the best way to do it in is is to
00:54:53 Like what I do with my composer videos were like, I know I can't say seven minutes worth of shit about an anime composer
00:55:00 So instead I'm just gonna play the fucking music and pop in every once in a while and say that was good
00:55:06 Like canapa has almost done something similar with animators except he talks almost too much because he will just keep repeating like and the
00:55:14 Animation here is drop dead gorgeous
00:55:16 And then he'll like play a clip and then he'll say and then over here the animation is so incredible
00:55:22 I like play I like I get it dude. Just make it just make a sake of a mad
00:55:27 Just have like an intro to it or something which I did that too with my
00:55:33 Videos that I always forget exist because they weren't on YouTube
00:55:36 Where I just like showed off like the early work of a bunch of like or it was directors who had previously been animators
00:55:42 And I had this video where it was basically an AMV where every once in a while
00:55:46 I'd cut in and say here's this guy and here's the stuff he did and then it's just another short AMV
00:55:51 You know cuz like yeah, sometimes you don't have enough words to really describe it
00:55:56 So like don't try to force the format on it
00:56:00 Be an analysis this particular brand of decisiveness you're talking about does not actually save you any time
00:56:05 It's just saving you a number of words wasted on the page
00:56:08 Yeah, well because it just sounds like shit when someone just keeps
00:56:12 Over and over again, you're like I fucking get it
00:56:14 You know just I feel like it's more effective if you just show it and and the audience will feel it emotionally, you know like
00:56:22 The Lucifer in the biscuit hammer video where you at no point or better example the girl in the gun part one
00:56:29 Like the bulk of that video is just an AMV with images showing your emotional reactions
00:56:34 Imagine how fucking garbage that video would be if instead of all those reactions
00:56:39 It was you describing your reactions to each moment and then that moment was so sad
00:56:44 Like in this moment was so uplifting none of the words it would it would be terrible
00:56:49 It would be awful to just oh my god
00:56:52 And then they got like twice as cool and then I was like four times as cool
00:56:56 Yeah, and I mean that's all those visuals are really saying yes, but it makes you feel it the same way like you
00:57:02 You're just you're going from a face that looks shocked to a face that looks utterly shocked
00:57:07 Then a physical transformation of my body exactly a real man
00:57:11 And it's like we we feel what you felt we don't even have to see the show to understand what you were feeling and like it means
00:57:18 It just hits you way harder to see it that it would be to hear it and like that's
00:57:23 Perfect conciseness you basically summarized and reacted to an entire fucking show in four minutes
00:57:30 Presenting the full range of emotions you felt a video is a fucking masterpiece
00:57:35 Absolutely a fucking masterpiece
00:57:38 You know what I'm kind of tired of is
00:57:41 Blowing smoke up Nate's ass about his girl
00:57:46 Yeah, well
00:57:48 What I'm kind of annoyed with is people being you know, they got all their concise talking but now with
00:57:55 With more, you know super eye patch wolf nerd writer sort of breathy talkie sort of oh
00:58:02 Fucking so cool guys. They they give it
00:58:06 Just those two seconds of imitation were hilarious to me
00:58:10 Make a parody video give
00:58:13 Yes, but that there's never really enough breathing room for me to feel like any of it means anything
00:58:20 Oh, yeah, I agree because I'm editing a blood-borne video and I've I've got this whole big
00:58:27 Filmed live-action bit at the beginning and I didn't expect it to be like really long
00:58:32 But at the moment it's like literally the size of my actual analysis that comes afterwards
00:58:37 And it's so good just listen just watching it and seeing how slow it is
00:58:41 It sets the tone of the game and then also the review because I you know, I'm silly and it's like it's
00:58:50 It has I really like it. I was just watching it. I'm like, why don't why don't and that analytical videos
00:58:57 Have more than just a small pause and then a swell of music before going into a big old boring thing
00:59:03 Those guys are a little bit to one note like they really they stick in one emotional range when they don't understand
00:59:10 I mean if they're trying to make a grand point. I really think like my girl log in part two does that correctly
00:59:16 It's it's about building to a point and you could be silly and you want to catch people off guard and make them laugh
00:59:20 And surprise them and then at the end when you're making your grand point
00:59:23 It's at that point that you've earned the climax. That's when you hit them with like the big music
00:59:27 I literally can't watch Nerdwriter anymore because I feel like every video he makes is trying to make the exact same point
00:59:33 This thing is impressive. Yeah, or Captain Christian as well. Like it's always it's always just building up to like wow
00:59:41 They sure did think about that. They sure didn't work. They sure did their jobs and made something good, you know, like but um
00:59:49 someone who I think does that kind of dramatic presentation well is a
00:59:54 Um body video where like it actually sucks you into the world. He's describing, you know, like he because it is like like
01:00:01 Hippo said with a nerdwriter. He's not slow enough. He's being slow to sound dramatic
01:00:06 Right, but then it just creates this kind of white noise feeling because not everything he's saying is dramatic body
01:00:11 I just feel just describing what's good about this movie and it's like this doesn't need this dramatic emotional
01:00:18 Wait, I don't think I was like a story teller
01:00:21 Is it all the stuff he's talking about is just the souls games which never get tired some of hearing about how great they are
01:00:27 Yeah, well and they have a consistent tone
01:00:29 So he can apply the same thing to every one and it it makes sense because you're always listening to
01:00:36 Because he's always making all the edits slick and I'm sure it's just because I make videos
01:00:42 But it always distracts me
01:00:44 Everything everything about nerdwriter distracts me now like because all I see is the artifice
01:00:48 Like I can't I can't even understand what he's talking about anymore
01:00:51 Cuz all I see is the artifice of the shit that he's been doing for two fucking years and has changed none of you know
01:00:57 Yeah, but like he always tries to like adjust the settings ever so slightly you never see quite the same thing, right?
01:01:03 You can just look at his thumbnail. It's the same feel and he has like 20 different fonts, right?
01:01:09 He really puts a lot of effort into typography and it's really distracting the typography is really distracting
01:01:15 It is it is great as I it's great on its own
01:01:19 But it's great in a way that takes away from it, you know
01:01:22 Just like I remember the day that I found the font that I use all the time now
01:01:26 That was a good day never had to think about what font to use is that the TBAP one
01:01:30 No, showcard gothic that was the TBAP one, but now I use Microsoft Tiley Microsoft Tiley. I'm all blue highway, baby
01:01:37 I know you are and I don't even think it looks good. I just it looks nice. It's fine. I'm gonna hate fonts
01:01:45 I'm getting pretty sick of blue highway at this point, but that's how I should feel. I don't want to change the font. It's like
01:01:52 Yeah, sorry hippo
01:01:54 Just to just to finish the blue highway point. Yeah, I I also like I mean I again
01:01:59 I don't even think it necessarily looks good. It's just that no one else uses it
01:02:02 So like it's so definitively mine that like and I don't know a better one, you know, so it's like fuck it
01:02:09 Let's just stick with this might as well. Okay. What were you saying though?
01:02:11 I was well, I was just saying I hate fonts and every time I have to choose a font is the fucking worst thing because I can
01:02:17 Never remember what fonts I've used before I never keep a record of it because I can't be able to type it down and then save a file somewhere
01:02:23 And then you know go on and use it forever. I
01:02:26 Can't remember them. I can never remember what I have been used
01:02:29 I I would recommend doing what Munchie did which is genius which he has a font called my script where it's just you turn your
01:02:36 handwriting into a font and
01:02:38 We use that for the s4 diaries like all of the like title cards and everything because Munchie had designed
01:02:45 The backgrounds for that and so if you watch like the ending of those videos
01:02:48 It's a great-looking font that he had of just his handwriting and like it was
01:02:55 Making fonts at age like 14
01:02:57 Yeah, I remember as other children are just finger banging in the backseat of mom's minivan
01:03:02 Just get serious kids get on Munchie's level remember CGP gray talking about how he like has
01:03:08 Specific fonts for specific purposes like there's one font that always is used if the words represent his own statement
01:03:14 From his own mind then he has another font that represents the collective opinion and another
01:03:20 Font that represents like straw man or something. I don't remember it's an early episode of hello internet
01:03:24 Where he breaks down like the different fonts that have different voices and I thought yeah
01:03:29 Fonds the thing the thing about that is that when I'm when I'm trying to type it like I need some text and I just go
01:03:35 Okay, let's get a font. I've never really prepared to think for any sort of a length of time about what font will be appropriate
01:03:43 So I feel like if I don't sit down and think about all these different fonts and which ones work for different things
01:03:49 I'm just gonna pick a random one every time because I can't be bothered to think about it because I just need the words on the screen
01:03:54 Yeah, yeah, what you should do is you should decide when you like you should use it in a video
01:03:58 And then what you should do is next time you're making a video open up that old Vegas project be like
01:04:02 Ah, yes, this is the file or this is the font I use and then use that and eventually you will just remember forever
01:04:07 There are font finder software. I did that like a website for my
01:04:12 Different give finishes point. Yeah, what we're saying
01:04:14 Well, I did that for my my pony reviews, but I got bored of it and now I can't I don't want to use it anymore
01:04:20 So now I just have a font that I will never use as opposed to a bunch of fonts that I will just randomly use at any time
01:04:26 Hey, Nate, let me finish this point. I intend to I am suffering with three-second lag here, brother
01:04:32 Boy person, okay, but yeah, there was talking over each other going on
01:04:36 So somebody had to go first. Okay, but in any case, I feel like we're done. I feel like we've hit the wall here
01:04:40 We're just kind of rambling. Why don't we go to questions? What do you think? We I'm okay with that
01:04:45 Monkey, did you want to talk about concise writing in fiction at all since you're here and haven't said shit? Yeah
01:04:51 In fiction or non-fiction Jesse wants to say something to her, and yeah, what Jesse, what were you gonna say?
01:04:58 Jesse Jesse
01:05:01 Don't remember. God damn it. I felt like I had a lot to say about this topic, but then I got scared and became confused
01:05:07 Okay, well the monkey you can go on and then maybe you'll remember
01:05:11 Yeah, I mean just I've already kind of said it in terms of concise writing
01:05:15 You can never trust yourself because you know what point you want to make but that point not might not be clear to somebody else
01:05:21 Who is experiencing the writing for the first time so I would say
01:05:24 Always find a trusted friend or parent or teacher to just look over that shit and tell you if you sound like a retard or not
01:05:30 I don't have any friends and also maybe more than one because I've started to have some concern that
01:05:39 Because I pass all my scripts to DeVue and I just kind of count on like well if DeVue gets it
01:05:44 It's fine, but DeVue also will listen to my video over and over again
01:05:49 And is definitely gonna understand it by the time it goes out and then sometimes I think maybe both of us
01:05:56 Understand it better than the audience is going to yeah
01:05:59 Fair enough to be fair. I don't do that as much
01:06:01 I mostly listen to it like once and then I just sit on it for days
01:06:05 And then maybe I listen to it one more time and then I go into editing it the last couple of videos
01:06:10 I've done like that. So hopefully not I don't know
01:06:13 I just I do I worry sometimes that me and you are so steeped in my
01:06:18 Analytical voice that we will autumn like of course we get the point that I'm making
01:06:24 And then but I have some videos that I'll return to like six months later
01:06:27 Once I've forgotten what the point was that video and I watch it and there's certain parts or I'm like
01:06:32 I don't know if I was clear enough here
01:06:34 You know like oh, I don't know if I really like if the audience will really appreciate what I'm saying unless they watch the video twice
01:06:40 You know because sometimes I'm too concise and I guess we need a PCP editorial department
01:06:46 Yeah, well the funny thing is that I I think I am amazing at editing anyone else's stuff
01:06:54 Like if it would be you then yeah, it would just be me
01:06:58 But then somebody would have to do mine probably you know
01:07:00 And it would just have to be tell me if it makes sense or not and if not I'll go fix
01:07:04 I remember one time there is this website really ancient web
01:07:08 1.5 website that was like dude pay us to give you the service of us editing your
01:07:14 Writing your pros and it goes on and on about how you really can't notice the flaws in your own works
01:07:20 And it was just talking about how much you really needs to hire editors and we're here to serve you and the html
01:07:25 Was so fucked up that you couldn't even see half the text
01:07:28 It was like uncensored and all the buttons were too big and you couldn't it was like an absolute mess for website
01:07:34 They specced into editing too hard and didn't put it into web design. They thought that was just like huh irony
01:07:41 well, yeah, and it's funny too because
01:07:43 Because I used to always show my videos to Victor and I'd ask him like did you get all that like did you understand it and like
01:07:50 Half the time he's like yeah, of course because like Victor does think analytically too like a lot of the time stuff that I say
01:07:57 He thinks is obvious and he's like you mean to tell me that people wouldn't know this already and I'm like no most people are
01:08:02 Retard and don't think about anything
01:08:04 But then there's also stuff where I will present it to somebody and I'll say like did you get that and they'll say yeah
01:08:11 And it'll be like well, what what was the point I was making they're like, I don't know like I know I understood it
01:08:17 I just don't know what the hell it was about. I'm like, yeah
01:08:20 Understanding works. Well, it's kind of just consume stuff though. They don't really yeah
01:08:24 Well, I think there's a lot of people who like just like kind of watch the video and like they can tell that what I'm saying makes sense
01:08:31 Yeah, they just don't fully process it and like they just go. Yeah, that was smart like I can tell that was smart
01:08:38 Yeah, I don't know what you said though, you know, like well, that's the thing some people aren't
01:08:44 Analytically minded in that way and even if they did understand it like properly
01:08:47 They may not be able to communicate it because they're not good at that
01:08:51 Yeah, they wouldn't be able to tell you back at you. I think that's true Victor like I think Victor understands all my videos
01:08:57 And just can't explain it back to me
01:08:59 But I have had people who I know
01:09:01 Don't get it and and like cuz I could see it in their eyes. They have that deer in the headlights retard look, you know
01:09:07 It's kind of like me and me and Jesse were discussing
01:09:11 rap lyricists recently and how
01:09:14 We both think MF doom is overrated
01:09:17 Because everyone always talks about how amazing doom is for his like crazy rhyme schemes and stuff
01:09:22 But most of his lyrics are literal fucking nonsense
01:09:25 And I think it's just that people are so impressed by like
01:09:28 The fact that he's making all these rhymes and like in stuff that they don't like it just goes over their head
01:09:34 And they think well, I just don't understand it cuz it's too smart. That's a real a lot of a lot of rappers
01:09:38 I notice really
01:09:40 Tend to bog themselves down in the show-offy like internal rhyming
01:09:45 Right to a ridiculous point and it is you know, it is impressive
01:09:50 But a lot of them are also not saying anything. Yeah, like it's like rap like there's been a lot like yeah
01:09:57 Like some of the best rappers ever, you know weren't rhyming every single word
01:10:02 They were just saying statements that rhymed
01:10:05 Yeah, like shake your fucking rapper
01:10:07 Yeah, if you don't see the vision if you don't see the vision in over your head. I'm floating
01:10:12 I got your girl deep throat
01:10:14 You're just not you're not up to stop which one is that that's a drop God somewhere. I think I
01:10:19 Could be rap God is like I mean in fairness rap God is like about the idea that he doesn't have to make a point
01:10:27 He's just flexing nuts, but that's why it's an obnoxious fucking piece of shit song
01:10:31 Hey
01:10:35 Wisdom in what is a juggalo? I don't know but you ask what it is. Well fuck if I know
01:10:43 Like showing shit to our family, you know like I have some pretty decent resources for that because I could I have my dad, right?
01:10:50 And my dad is someone who is?
01:10:54 Intellectual and is analytical and open-minded
01:10:57 But is like a baby boomer who has literally no interest or point of reference for anything
01:11:03 I care about and always forgets everything that I tell him after I'm done explaining it
01:11:07 so basically I'm able to use him as like a
01:11:10 Mechanism to like if I can explain something in a way that he gets and is mildly interested by then I know I'm doing it correctly
01:11:17 Like one time I explained Sonic OCs to him, right?
01:11:21 So first I had to explain Sonic and then the adventure era and then the concept of fandom and then OCs and he was like oh
01:11:27 Okay, and I can tell in his face when he's getting something or not
01:11:32 So yeah, yeah, you can use your family
01:11:34 You can't bother them and waste their time and waste their life
01:11:37 To help my kids good for that as well
01:11:40 Except that he has such a short attention span that somewhere in the middle
01:11:43 He'll like notice something out of the corner of his eye and it'll completely make him wipe all memory of the conversation
01:11:50 He's having he's a squirrel like a human squirrel
01:11:53 My brother as well. My brother is I guess I'm going down the list here
01:11:57 Just so that you guys can compare it to your own families and think about what resources you have in them because like my brother is someone who
01:12:03 Can appreciate all the things that I appreciate in art, but has an
01:12:09 Unbelievably short fuse for giving for no longer giving a shit
01:12:13 So it's like if anything isn't perfect then he's gonna be like, okay, I'm done with this
01:12:18 So it's like he's a pretty good useful to I was like explaining to my brother a lot of my ideas for for a video game
01:12:23 And like he was on he was nodding his head at all of them
01:12:27 Unfucking presidented with me telling him my ideas. So that really was a good sign for me
01:12:33 Yeah, what are we still going to questions I
01:12:37 Still okay, I have two points two pieces of advice
01:12:43 Keeping it in the realm of like you writing concisely for YouTube because that's what I know
01:12:48 That's our area of expertise
01:12:50 I have two pieces of advice that I've thought of during this for writing concisely as I explained that I have these two pieces of advice as
01:12:59 Inconsisely as possible by repeating myself 50 times the first piece of advice is
01:13:06 Never write an intro don't do it intros are always bad
01:13:10 They're always a waste of time right just if it if you want to do like a like a skit
01:13:16 Or like a funny aside put it in the middle of the video because no one's going to sit through an intro to get to your point
01:13:23 But if you just start throw them right in there to the point then they'll see that and get to whatever else other
01:13:30 Tell them to not watch the video, which is what you do half the time just like this video isn't good. Don't watch it
01:13:35 Yeah, because yeah
01:13:38 Audience I warn them when a video is garbage to piggyback on that a little bit
01:13:42 I'll say I think I think a lot of why intros get written is that people don't know how to start their paper or whatever
01:13:49 Like they're just looking for a way to like get the juices rolling
01:13:52 So I'll say write an intro and then delete it like once you've got the ball rolling and you figure out what you're saying
01:13:58 Just go back and delete the intro. I don't I think it comes from that, you know
01:14:03 High school college you have to have this many words
01:14:06 You have to have a thesis that is three seconds long your thesis doesn't have to be so many sentences long
01:14:11 It can be one word you get one sentence this thing is cool the end then get to the fucking point
01:14:15 I mean if you saw like my last video
01:14:17 My last video had the thesis in the title and I don't even say it in the like the title
01:14:22 Yeah, like how much does
01:14:25 Visuals matter in anime and then the first sentence video is obviously it's a matter of opinion, you know
01:14:30 So I just didn't yeah never write intros don't waste anyone's time
01:14:33 It's just jump into it you you have the compulsion to think that you'll lose people by jumping into it
01:14:39 But you won't the opposite is true and this is um
01:14:42 This is something that I've learned by sucking at it for very long and very slowly coming to terms with how to write for YouTube
01:14:49 Particularly and the other piece of advice that that I've learned mainly by sucking at it myself for many years before I
01:14:56 Slowly got the hang of it. Um is not every video has to be mr. Plinkett
01:15:03 Yeah, there's the compulsion especially for like people who write analysis type videos of
01:15:12 This video about this thing has to say everything about this thing
01:15:16 I'm gonna encompass the entire scope of it. Sometimes it works out. Well, you know Nate's Gurren login is a great video
01:15:23 But even that's in two parts. Um, yep
01:15:25 Yeah, I used to do that all the time and
01:15:28 It would really hamstring me because I'd say this. Yeah, you know what?
01:15:32 You know what YouTube review show suffers for trying to make every episode mr. Plinkett same to me
01:15:39 What's that mr. Plinkett that's true
01:15:42 Mr. Plinkett show itself has all these episodes that are trying to be mr. Plinkett and don't need to be and I'm just like what's like
01:15:47 No, what are you talking about? I think he means like like babies day out didn't have to be a 45 minute video
01:15:54 No, that was a 23 minute video and it was freeing because they all thought he was gonna do episode 3 of Star Wars
01:15:59 Then he did a kids movie. Yeah, that was fine. That's a joke
01:16:02 But like you know like say the um the Indiana Jones one that was just like the only point
01:16:08 I can actively remember is they don't have any violence that that was the Indiana Jones video is very meandering and all over the place
01:16:16 I feel like he was trying to force an hour of content out of it
01:16:19 And it was just like exploring like what they can do in the future like what sort of content will work
01:16:24 Like are we really just gonna have to do Plinkett forever? I don't like that was early days
01:16:27 I think they were still
01:16:29 I mean it's my point is that you can really hamstring yourself by trying to put everything into a single video
01:16:35 And you won't get as much content out as fast as possible. You won't improve me a math of that
01:16:40 Yeah, and I'm you know like for example, I'm looking right now
01:16:43 And at like an old like a gun buster my Japanese anime is that I wrote two years ago, and it's like 25 pages long
01:16:50 Yeah, I never got around to actually making it because I'm looking at these 25 pages of words
01:16:55 And I'm like I don't want to edit all of this
01:16:57 But now I'm looking at it years later and just thinking well wait a minute
01:17:01 I can clearly split this up into like four different videos if I yeah, and that would be like way easier and actually getting made that way
01:17:08 So just just don't not everything else
01:17:13 And I think that's the problem with like the extra credits problem where we've explained all the shit
01:17:17 I don't need analysis to exist anymore. I know it all now
01:17:22 But the whole point of continuing to make pieces in an artistic medium for the incoming generations
01:17:29 Is you have to keep making the point to people so I feel like we just need kids analysis
01:17:34 We need like specifically PBS Nerdwriter that is just like telling you all the basic shit
01:17:39 The cartoon dog talks about ludonarrative dissonance and you have a fucking moose comes in and talks about Xomkin's work, right?
01:17:46 And that way like all the adults can just focus on higher-minded shit
01:17:54 I'm glad Jesse brought all that up because me and Nate were literally talking about this last night
01:17:58 I think during the interview that yeah
01:18:02 This will be out the Nate interviews gonna be out
01:18:04 So I interviewed me and we were talking about how there was kind of this perception that we all had back in 2015
01:18:10 Where like we all looked up to 45 minute long
01:18:14 hyper detailed analysis like you know like mr. Beaton on Mass Effect or
01:18:20 Mr. Plinkett or
01:18:21 Sequelitis and like we all had this idea like that's the ultimate video. That's what we should all be trying to do
01:18:27 That's what matters the most and Nate did Girl in the Gone Part 2 and Jesse did the drowning in horse shoes videos leading up to
01:18:33 Horseshoe finale and I did the SAO videos the the asterisk war which I mean asterisk war at least split into parts in like a
01:18:38 Big way, you know
01:18:40 But like we all had this idea of like it has to be the biggest possible thing
01:18:44 And what that it yeah what eventually happens is you never make it
01:18:48 And then you end up with like more than one of those like it's one thing if you have one
01:18:51 You know you have to do right girl in the gone. It had to happen to be done, you know and like
01:18:57 There's there's a couple that I think probably I still have to do
01:19:01 You know
01:19:01 But like one of the biggest hurdles I ever got over as a creator was deciding not to write a book about ava
01:19:08 And just to make videos about whatever ideas I had about ava and and now I have like eight hyper successful
01:19:14 Evangelion videos and I still could make like 20 more
01:19:18 as the ideas come to me, but
01:19:21 Those would not be out
01:19:22 Like if I was still in the mindset that I have to make one giant ava video there would still be no ava video
01:19:27 And it's question. That's how stuff becomes that's how stuff becomes too much of a burden
01:19:32 That's how you get buried under your own ideas. That's how a boy gets trapped in the furnace room
01:19:36 And you don't want that you don't want that you do not what there's a spooky pattern there. Watch out
01:19:40 That's spooky bad video actually freaked me out. Oh man that that that bad is so scary
01:19:45 You don't even know guys every day
01:19:48 I watched that I watched that video
01:19:50 I watched that video while I was alone in a hotel room
01:19:53 And like the the music kind of got into my head and I went outside to have a smoke and I was just kind of like
01:20:00 Guys, we should make this this kids analysis show the the subtext submarine the vinid the venetian
01:20:11 Go to patreon.com slash to procrastinators
01:20:13 Whatever the fuck you are ls if we get ten thousand dollars, we will get hippo to animate
01:20:18 Uh, the animated series talking about analysis that way everyone
01:20:22 From write out the fucking womb. It'll just be our animal characters. Yeah explaining at analytical points. That sounds great
01:20:29 Real quick just for clarification for audience members who may be feeble minded such as myself all the points you just made
01:20:35 How does that comparable to at the beginning of this when you said you put all your points in one video
01:20:41 Whereas anime snob separates them into separate videos like is that kind of the same idea?
01:20:46 Well, what what I mean to say is like
01:20:50 I it's not that I put every idea into one video
01:20:52 It's that my videos tend to go through various points like my videos go through stages. It's always like
01:20:58 However many points. I think belong in this video, you know
01:21:01 Like um, I recently did this video series about miss Kobayashi's dragon maid and it was planned to be three videos
01:21:08 And it's just because I had a shitload of points
01:21:11 And I said well, let's break like I don't want to make a 45 minute video because it's not cost effective
01:21:16 To do that. So let's split it into 15 minute parts
01:21:19 And I had just enough notes about the main character to make one 17 minute video about her
01:21:25 Then I had enough notes about the other characters to make one 13 minutes video about them
01:21:29 And then I had enough notes about the art and animation that I can make a third video whenever I feel like it, you know, so like
01:21:36 Like those videos are
01:21:38 Fairly long individually, but it's because they're going through all of the points that I thought needed to be in one video
01:21:44 Like everything about Kobayashi. So it's kind of like five that anime snob videos in one video
01:21:50 I mean the real problem at the end of the day with anime snob is that the entire video is a waste of time because he's just wrong
01:21:55 He is just wrong. That's I mean, that's the worst part
01:21:58 Like don't don't take this as me in in any way endorsing the way he does things like his style of video could make sense
01:22:05 It's just that he's literally retired. Yeah
01:22:10 Yeah, yeah good anime
01:22:12 So 17 a Pomeranian talks about post modernism. I'll work on my puns. Don't worry
01:22:19 Okay, I I have a tip for for conciseness
01:22:24 um
01:22:25 Stop writing clever youtube titles. I don't like it when
01:22:30 They there you just stop it. This is a personal thing. He's on the war. What does that have to do with conciseness?
01:22:36 Because if you just write the name of the thing plus analysis or review, I wouldn't I'm
01:22:41 Way more likely to click on it if I don't know what it is
01:22:44 If you're trying to convince me to click on a video about the 10 secret hidden things and subtexts
01:22:49 That nobody has noticed about this other thing or anime
01:22:53 I I don't know the anime to begin with. Honestly hippo at this point
01:22:56 I would prefer numbers and exclamation marks because I've at this point gotten
01:23:00 completely sick of the nerd writer style of like the eloquent sentence that sounds all dramatic and hyphalutin, you know like
01:23:06 How this thing captures that just shit, you know like
01:23:10 It seems to work though
01:23:12 Yeah, it seems like it but it works
01:23:13 It works on the sort of people who think they know everything and would like to know the secret special extra things that supers intelligent people
01:23:20 I just want to know stuff. I just want to know about a thing
01:23:23 We will our fans will watch our stuff, but if we want to bring in new people
01:23:26 We have to trick them into watching the video to give them good people. They think they're smart
01:23:30 Well, I do because I want to fucking survive on this shit patrons if you don't bring in new
01:23:34 I will kill all the people
01:23:36 I hate them. I mean hippo stupid. What do you think of my titles hippo?
01:23:41 I can't remember give me a title you have
01:23:44 How I learned to stop worrying and and skip a cashew records
01:23:48 Or uh, well that one's funny. That one's got like a yeah, that one's a reference. So
01:23:52 In a very well-known reference. What's the one I did on kimono friends the lucid dream world of kimono friends?
01:23:59 I don't know. What do you think? I mean hippo. What book are you more likely to read?
01:24:03 satire about women or men are better than women
01:24:07 Like do you want the honest title or the cool title?
01:24:10 I want the cool one. I'm sorry. What I'm saying is I think you're talking about something more specific than what we're
01:24:16 Saying you're talking. Well, what hippo is saying is like
01:24:19 We should name everything like avan galley in review number five like why not give it a no, no, no, no, no
01:24:25 No, no, no, no, no what I mean is that people
01:24:27 they I've just seen but just recently there's like every single type of video
01:24:33 in that in that of that ilk seems to be under the assumption that you already
01:24:38 know the basics and you're looking for some extra shit and I will never click
01:24:42 on anything that implies that I know what I what I you know like a nerdwriter
01:24:47 videos every title is trying to play into your desire to be smart right like
01:24:52 he's constantly trying to reassure you that by watching his video you are
01:24:57 gaining an arcane knowledge that will make you stronger or give you a deep
01:25:01 appreciation for this cultural touchstone that everybody already understands
01:25:04 give you that nerd credit is so valuable and today's social economy oh my like I
01:25:09 would much rather just watch a straight review of something that everybody is
01:25:13 seen but I haven't no no game reviews for you hug you
01:25:17 let's say like Seinfeld right and I have never seen like a normal straight
01:25:22 review of Seinfeld and but I have seen plenty of annoying like extra videos
01:25:29 about the subtext and the extra things that you you know Seinfeld everyone
01:25:33 know Seinfeld here's some more I will never never enjoy that people complaining
01:25:38 about things that everyone's talking about on the internet that I haven't
01:25:41 heard like you know my introduction to Ludo narrative dissonance was movie was
01:25:46 the game over thinker episode called stop talking to me about Ludo narrative
01:25:51 dissonance and my second exposure to it was someone else being like oh god yeah
01:25:56 it was Jimquisition talking about Ludo scabib disco biscuits like oh jeez so
01:26:00 much Ludo narrative dissonance out there since everyone just spent all their
01:26:04 day reading blog posts by shitty blog artists like me Jimquisition I'm like
01:26:09 no I don't know you're the only person I listen to that complains about this but
01:26:14 if we can't have an intro where we tell people the basics and we also like can't
01:26:18 assume everybody knows everything what are we supposed to do well I'm not
01:26:22 talking about intros I'm talking about entire videos like if you know they're
01:26:25 part of entire video simple this is what we need the fucking we have a
01:26:29 German chef about German expressionism we have a fucking monkeys looking sorry
01:26:35 sorry sorry whatever sorry simultaneously trying to say that you
01:26:46 should like not just do summary but that you should also in hippo wants like
01:26:50 standard reviews but what hippos means is that he wants there to be videos that
01:26:55 are just a actual review of the thing without assuming that everyone's already
01:27:00 seen it it's really all it is is that it's the the flowery and the insinuation
01:27:05 of the title that makes me not want to click on it like if you if you are
01:27:09 talking about say the content of the video is exactly the same if you just
01:27:13 title it Seinfeld analysis then I'm gonna click on it because I want to know
01:27:16 but I think most people wouldn't click on that you gotta play the game title well
01:27:21 I hate YouTube then fair enough yeah I think hippo would title yeah I think
01:27:27 hippo would click on it if you said like why is Seinfeld so well loved you know
01:27:32 if that was the title you'd probably click on that because that's what you're
01:27:34 trying to find out well maybe not at this point because I just I just generally
01:27:37 hate titles video titles they got to go they got to go yeah your channel
01:27:47 banner your channel banner for hypocrites should just be the words I'm gonna
01:27:52 kill you you know you are the hypocrites so it's entirely appropriate that you
01:27:58 make YouTube videos about how much YouTube sucks and is a piece of shit yep
01:28:03 well all right how about we go to the questions now team let's do it let's do
01:28:08 it here we go I feel no ill will towards anyone I am just I don't like
01:28:15 YouTube I don't like seeing titles I don't like seeing titles and reading
01:28:21 them and having to decide on whether or not I hate it I mean why would you want
01:28:25 to review a show you like like why would you want to Seinfeld review if you know
01:28:29 nothing about it anyway couldn't you just read a summary to see if you'd be
01:28:32 into because Gibbs heard a lot about Seinfeld over the years so they just
01:28:35 fucking watch it well I can't have a television I don't know I think of an
01:28:39 analysis is good and interesting you'll just sort of inadvertently get all the
01:28:43 shit and eventually know all the obvious stuff I'm not really I'm not really
01:28:46 looking for a Seinfeld analysis I'm just I just don't like people being smart I
01:28:51 don't like people having smart that's really my entire point if you're trying
01:28:54 to be smart I hate you in forever like after watching like a combined total of
01:28:58 like 15,000 hours of Roger Vanderweed analyzing Sonic I already I now know all
01:29:03 the basic stuff without him ever actually attempting to explain basic stuff
01:29:07 just through inference mm-hmm so here we go people question number one read this
01:29:14 question Nate here I go okay at our old friend ice killer 159 asks yo PCP you
01:29:21 get to experience a piece of media for the first time again what do you choose
01:29:25 between a attorney and death question oh man yeah where you go Elton whoa whoa
01:29:34 definitely lost that's my answer I already know it lost huh even with the
01:29:38 ending oh yeah that's that we know is bad especially oh is bad this is this is
01:29:45 my communist classes are not fucking orange anyone who says the ending of
01:29:48 losses bad I'll fucking find you and I'll kill your whole family Jesse I think
01:29:54 you are as passionate about every opinion you actually end up caring about as
01:29:57 much as Nate is about the glasses thing like I think for you it's like 99% of
01:30:01 opinions you immediately discard because you know that if you let your
01:30:04 opinions sit there for more than five seconds it's gonna become like a hill to
01:30:08 die on I'm passionate about all of my opinions equally until I remember how I
01:30:14 feel about lost and then I'm passionate about nothing
01:30:20 if I could read what I was sorry hippo go ahead now you go okay if I could
01:30:23 experience something for the first time again it would have to be the final
01:30:27 three episodes of season four of Breaking Bad I don't think anything has
01:30:30 enthralled me as a viewer more than what was happening so the first of the
01:30:35 three is the crawlspace episode which is very famous where he laughs at the end
01:30:39 and goes yeah yeah god damn I that that was the bingiest binge watch I've ever
01:30:44 been I'll tell you and that was the cringiest cringe watch I've ever cringed
01:30:49 oh your show sucks for my answer for this like going on most of the like with
01:31:03 most movies and TV shows I tend to like it more the more times I see it so like
01:31:08 most of those I feel like I wouldn't want to hear or see for the first time
01:31:12 but like any album that I like for me like the most magical time with an album
01:31:18 is when I'm first getting into it and it feels mysterious and like I can't tell
01:31:22 the difference between all the songs yet and it's just like like for instance
01:31:26 Rat King so it goes is a great example where I was like playing this album on
01:31:29 repeat while playing fantasy star online for a few days and it would just be like
01:31:34 you know as it's going I pick up on little things I'm like oh here's that
01:31:37 song I remember hearing this part and like it just feels like this endless
01:31:41 magical you know like just getting to hear all these different things that I
01:31:46 didn't know about and then eventually once I've heard the album enough times
01:31:49 and I know exactly what's where that's where I start forming opinions like oh
01:31:52 this song's a little weaker than the others so I might skip that track or
01:31:56 like oh this is the good verse this is the you know that part like oh now I
01:32:01 now I've got like all these opinions about it and I don't have that sheer
01:32:04 just wonder of experience something I don't completely understand yet so like
01:32:09 especially longer albums like third side of tape by Lil ugly main because that
01:32:14 one's like too over two hours long and it's just like a random compilation of
01:32:19 weird songs that that are like all completely different from one another
01:32:23 so it was always like this total mind-altering experience to listen to
01:32:26 it until I'd heard it like 30 times and now it's like oh okay this is the part
01:32:30 where the obnoxious 10-minute black metal song kicks in let's skip that you
01:32:35 know yeah yeah so yeah any album really okay okay
01:32:40 what about the human equation do you want to hear the human equation again
01:32:44 human equation would be yeah that's that's an example of one that in the
01:32:48 early days was like very mysterious I believe the human equation is pussy plus
01:32:54 my face a happy boy did you are we still doing a PCP episode over the human
01:33:04 equation it's on the list if anybody else fucking listens to it we'll get
01:33:08 the boo and Nate and that's all we need I'll listen to it listen to it we'll
01:33:12 fucking make you listen to it did you hear over at his house force him tie him
01:33:15 up clockwork orange style only price ears open instead of his eyes I'll knock
01:33:20 him out and then put it like tie him to a chair and then he'll wake up he'll go
01:33:23 I can't move I don't remember what's happening now I don't remember anything
01:33:31 you fucking pleb by the way my answer this question without a doubt without a
01:33:37 doubt is certainly one piece I want to take that journey again knowing nothing
01:33:40 and luckily for you it's not over yet so you still can that's the great thing
01:33:44 about it man you should you guys I want to tell our audience you have never
01:33:47 heard someone read something more enthusiastically than Nate rage one
01:33:51 piece I'm sitting in the other room and just hearing Naco oh my god go check
01:34:01 out the new episode oh my god I didn't finish this fucking video yet I have to
01:34:04 make it I totally forgot yeah make that shit I'll make it today go check out the
01:34:08 new episode it'll be up like last week at this point of the potty cast and like
01:34:12 the things that happen to this chapter really were yet again the most
01:34:18 blowing things of all time it really scared me I was actually terrifying and
01:34:23 like beyond it was a new fun level I'm glad to find out that I'm not the only
01:34:27 like the only the only loud reader who passionately I scream I yell I like
01:34:33 like when I read comics I like I do all the voices out loud and I like pace
01:34:37 around the room doing my Kevin Conroy voice and my fucking Joker voice and
01:34:41 like if anyone if anyone else is in the house and I don't know about it and they
01:34:44 hear me have to go out of the house screaming and never come back if you
01:34:47 read a comic quietly everything goes according to plan there's no problem
01:34:50 but but you read a comic and you get a little loud everyone loses their mind
01:34:54 if I read a comic quietly then it's not really happening it's just a fake made
01:34:58 up a little book for kids if I read it out loud and the characters are really
01:35:02 here then it's real then it's real hip-hop did you have an answer for this I
01:35:07 I do being a many years veteran of World of Warcraft I'm very I'm very
01:35:14 disillusioned with it I'm very like tired of the high what happens with
01:35:19 World of Warcraft the reason it grips so many people is because the initial
01:35:22 experience of seeing how big the world is in all the places there are is
01:35:26 absolutely fucking magical as the best part of love with it and you just you
01:35:31 want to live there you want to go you want to do everything and I have I've
01:35:33 done literally everything in that game aside from the current expansion and to
01:35:37 the point where it nothing excites me anymore and it really it really is sad
01:35:41 because it's like so much so so cool that's the my fucking that's a great
01:35:46 answer and I feel that way about every MMO I've played sure like with wow it
01:35:50 was specifically just the undead starting country because playing through
01:35:54 that was fucking magical and then I got to the next area which was like the
01:35:58 badlands that thought it was lame so I just restarted and played through the
01:36:02 starting undead place like three times and just until I completely knew it and
01:36:06 then it was not as interesting hey same goes for like Terra or Black Desert like
01:36:10 any of those games when you first started it's just like whoa this this world
01:36:14 it's so huge about the soul the soul starting area was great but I love that
01:36:19 fucking place fucking trolls are the best race everyone else is shit and wow
01:36:22 only trolls are good you have a you have an answer to do yes actually as I was
01:36:27 thinking about it everything that I liked at one point then over consumed I
01:36:31 don't want to regress to a point of not having ever experienced it because it
01:36:35 was instrumental in my understanding of what makes things good and you know I
01:36:39 use it as an influence so I don't want to fuck with the timeline that badly sure
01:36:43 my god you're right to who because if I went back in time to when I hadn't seen
01:36:46 lost I might listen to people who say the ending is bad exactly what I want
01:36:53 there's this stupid dumbass show called the pretender which is sort of like a
01:36:57 proto like like hour-long weekly American drama type of thing that like alias
01:37:02 and lost sort of followed up on and it's like a late 90s thing has a lot of
01:37:06 weird superficial similarities with alias actually and it has an interesting
01:37:11 sort of character premise but it is the Ranma one half of America because it
01:37:15 just it doesn't progress anything ever and it's four seasons long and I just
01:37:19 watched it because I was watching it with my family huge ways to fucking time so
01:37:23 if I it did not like you know there's other shows that like I didn't like and
01:37:27 like I regret watching but I don't regret watching because it was it's like fun
01:37:31 and I think it's interesting how they fuck up the pretender is just mediocre
01:37:35 and stupid and it was just the one time in my life or for whatever reason I was
01:37:39 willing to waste that much time and not expand my knowledge of anything ever for
01:37:43 any reason whatsoever so if I can erase my viewing from history and then have to
01:37:48 begin watching it again my current self will have no tolerance for it and turn
01:37:52 it off immediately and I'll have saved myself like a combined total of like 50
01:37:55 hours so you do it all for those 50 hours yeah use all of it on D you know
01:38:06 what he means yeah the D board okay so that's everybody right we've all gone
01:38:11 through this yep let's I've got here's another question that I absolutely love
01:38:16 okay here we go so this is at pond itator asks at PCP who is the hottest
01:38:24 sailor scout I've spent a lot of time you don't know the well enough it's
01:38:29 absolutely marz is not even a contest not even a doubt wait it's Mars the black
01:38:34 hair the sailor Mars is the black hair I thought it was the coolest guy you've
01:38:39 ever seen the only male one oh that's all that's obvious you're right but aside
01:38:46 aside from the coolest guy I'm looking at up I'm looking at a pop vinyl sailor
01:38:50 Mars right now yeah it's got a picture of all of them lined up next to each
01:38:55 other and Mars is like far and away the hottest the only other one that I like
01:38:58 I mean I do appreciate Jupiter but Mars is by far the best I never seen sailor
01:39:05 moon now I'm just kidding the hottest one is homura I don't know who that is
01:39:09 from come out of magic is that is that is that cat like like the cat from
01:39:15 Sabrina the teenage it's the same cat yes the same thing cool I like that cat I
01:39:21 will fuck that cat okay I still like Captain Crunch and I'll stand by that
01:39:28 okay here we go at solely claw asks if gay was a physical object musical genre
01:39:35 or food what would it be two balls touch gay if gay if gay I'm not I was
01:39:41 gonna say didgy it would be didgy is the by first okay was a food it would
01:39:44 definitely wait they got cut off say that again what my your audio my my my
01:39:53 brilliant corn dog joke oh my god you guys weren't laughing I thought it wasn't
01:40:03 funny I was just like through my fucking corn dog joke out there just like
01:40:09 dead silence like no it finally happened yep it's over for you dude time to walk
01:40:17 into the into the into the snow and die anyone have any of the suggestions for
01:40:23 what gay would be do they say genre of music yeah that was one whichever one
01:40:30 sucks a dad get it okay let's move on to this question this is dead air let's
01:40:49 okay here we go here we go at our hero monkey away asks a very apropos question
01:40:55 what's stopping the other PCB members from doing their own me a math of a
01:41:00 yes I don't know if this is supposed to be an insult he says standards or work
01:41:04 ethic like no one else has low enough standards or they don't have low enough
01:41:08 work ethic to make I came up with one concept where I do a video every day
01:41:14 all year called 2018 too cool zero fucks given one video a day you're going to
01:41:22 hate all of them which is pretty great I do like that a lot I did fucking me a
01:41:28 for three years ago you asshole you didn't brand it hard enough I didn't
01:41:32 brand it at all he didn't brand it all it was a secret it was a secret because
01:41:36 he had money on the line as to whether or not he would succeed and if you
01:41:39 fail a lot of money would have ran away with the money yeah Nate you had to pay
01:41:42 me for that right you bet against me and I think you gave me 10 bucks I don't
01:41:46 think I actually was in on that bet I would have bet against you if I know
01:41:49 you were in on the bet I don't know if you ever paid out but you were in on it
01:41:52 are you sure about that yeah I know you were because Ben Ben was the only one of
01:41:56 the PCP who wouldn't bet against me because he said he wanted to bet for me
01:42:00 and I was like you can't do that and I will give you ten dollars I think you
01:42:03 might have it's possible I really don't remember being involved at all but I'll
01:42:06 trust you here's my theory I'm talking about is in 2014 I made a video every
01:42:11 day in October and I made bets with like everyone I knew like to see if like you
01:42:16 know to incentivize me to do it right mostly it was my mom and dad who like
01:42:21 we're betting the most and and they're the only ones I like really hammered to
01:42:25 pay me but like yeah it made bets with like everybody but I didn't like announce
01:42:29 that I was doing it because I was scared if I did it wouldn't get completed as
01:42:32 tends to be the case when I announced projects so it was only like at the very
01:42:36 end of the month that I acknowledged that I had just done this thing whereas
01:42:41 Nate like made it very clear opposite because you'll get bored if I announce
01:42:45 it then I have to do it or else I won't yeah well speaking of that I had an
01:42:51 idea of doing a July me a math I don't know what I should well I mean in the
01:42:58 meantime you've got your I know it's demon dark blood month bro it's not
01:43:03 really the same but it's it's good similar I like it's more than one it's
01:43:07 more than zero videos I want to say what I usually record all of us are
01:43:10 insanely prolific in that kind of way of me a math of a like Gibbon has had months
01:43:16 where he puts out videos like almost every day on Gibbon take Jesse's had
01:43:20 months where he's put out a video almost every day just on random channels and I
01:43:24 do literally put out a video every day like hey there's the air a furnace room
01:43:30 has no breaks there's been a video every single day that's in addition to pony
01:43:33 cast it's in addition to other videos and other channels I also I did do a video
01:43:38 every day in October of 2013 and I'm still bearing the emotional stress from it
01:43:42 most of those are hidden now but that that was right right I had an idea to
01:43:47 like do like next year do like me a math of a to maybe I'll actually make a video
01:43:53 but like the joke would be that I don't make a video and like I said maybe right
01:43:57 you said maybe I don't actually have to do it great even that would have been too
01:44:06 much work for me I'll just say it here
01:44:10 let's say here's a simple matter of like crop rotation we're like going out into
01:44:15 the world and watching movies and like being a real person to like form actual
01:44:19 opinions is like planting cotton and then yeah making a video explaining your
01:44:25 shit is like planting corn and I think like someone like mr. B tongue right
01:44:29 spent like 30 years just being a normal guy probably writing a lot of college
01:44:33 papers or some shit but never airing out any of his thoughts and then over the
01:44:37 course of a couple years he just drops absolute gold and then he runs out and
01:44:41 he only comes back once a year to like have another little bit of corn yeah so
01:44:45 for me I'm just kind of that's why that's really why I don't have any problem
01:44:48 with not making any videos I'm just I'm just fucking planting cotton up my ass
01:44:52 guys and it's gonna all shoot out one day and incredible rainbow I think I think
01:44:56 everyone needs to understand about me a math of a is that that that thing
01:45:00 wouldn't have been possible if not for the fact that Nate had not been doing
01:45:05 that for the last two years because 30 ideas in a row is a hell of a lot because
01:45:10 our work is all based on other stuff like it's not like Casey Neistat where
01:45:15 he just goes out and literally films his day every day and half the videos are
01:45:19 the exact same like he goes to the airport he flies to another country he
01:45:22 goes somewhere like we have to every single time have something new to talk
01:45:26 about and it's one thing if you go two years making one video every two months
01:45:31 you've got this huge stockade of shit you've been planning to talk about that
01:45:34 you've never gotten around to and then just boom blow through a bunch of it in
01:45:37 a month but if Nate tried to do me a math of a again right afterwards then
01:45:42 suddenly it's gonna be oh shit I'm out of ideas you know that's absolutely true
01:45:46 I there were plenty in that October is that I fucking completely like at the
01:45:51 end of the month you'll see the last like five videos are just like really
01:45:55 struggling to come up with something I do have a bunch of ideas that I you know
01:45:59 was just stockpiling to put as potential stuff but I picked the ones that I
01:46:01 thought were the best but but more so than that what what is interesting to me
01:46:05 about me a math that makes it sort of special I guess is that it really was
01:46:10 very time-bounded and like a one-time thing and it was an event like I to do
01:46:16 it even to do it for a year I really think people would get bored even if I
01:46:20 was delivering content you know better than ever and just doing that same shit
01:46:23 I don't think people would give a fuck after a while which is for you know
01:46:27 variety people are into variety they want to feel like something special is
01:46:30 happening everyone was so hyped to be involved with this thing that was going
01:46:33 on during this time and it was it was very effective but to do it to like
01:46:37 immediately do like the same sort of thing even like two months later they'd
01:46:40 be like oh yeah like we got it here the cheers they'd be like yeah a little
01:46:43 quieter then like maybe a month later so yeah okay we're doing this again all
01:46:47 right same shit so I don't know like yeah yeah that's the only reason I'm not
01:46:53 sure about doing a July one I mean it's not gonna have the same pipe there's
01:46:56 gonna be a few people they'll be like oh you're doing one now that's cool but
01:47:00 really you know I don't really want it to be I don't really care too much about
01:47:04 it being like a big like oh yeah branding and everyone buys all about that
01:47:09 bright shirts mostly cuz I can't be bothered to think about that I just want
01:47:14 to make I just want to get into the habit of being able to make you gotta get
01:47:17 one videos in a month I think it's that that skill is something I need yeah and
01:47:22 I think it's important for everybody to realize that like all of that branding
01:47:25 and stuff is it's not just that that's a good like marketing decision it's that
01:47:30 that's what allowed Nate to do that I couldn't have done it if he didn't make
01:47:34 it a big deal it had to have lots of pressure it had to be like a lot of
01:47:38 personal responsibility on the line personally for me that wouldn't have
01:47:41 worked on me but having money on the line worked right because I am a fucking
01:47:44 Jew and I will not like the idea that I was gonna have to pay out a hundred and
01:47:48 ten dollars because that's about how much how many bets I made yeah the idea of
01:47:52 having to pay a hundred ten dollars because I failed to make a video every
01:47:54 day was completely unacceptable you know it was funny I don't know if I
01:47:57 mentioned this in the interview yesterday but like I had actually been
01:47:59 planning on one of the things I was gonna make as part of me in math but was a
01:48:02 deal with the audience where if I don't succeed at making all this I will like
01:48:07 give the money away that I make during this month to like whatever we'll have
01:48:11 like a poll like I was really considering that but then I just thought you
01:48:14 know what like that is unnecessary I don't think people the problem with that
01:48:18 is it would people would start holding you to like oh it has to be midnight yeah
01:48:22 like then it would have been weird standards for stuff whereas this was
01:48:24 better but yeah that was that was tossed around but yeah I don't know I
01:48:29 guess there's a place for me in math was in the world but I don't know like I
01:48:34 would love a give me a math of some kind I'd love like what I want from give and
01:48:37 that's what me a math was was an excuse for you to just make tons of content
01:48:40 fast I want to know what you're thinking I want to see you do goofy what I want
01:48:44 from given is just in the same thing that I was inspired up with by me a
01:48:49 math of which is a middle ground yeah between like the absolute like I made
01:48:54 this in 10 seconds but it is fucking great that is give and take and the like
01:48:59 this took a whole month that is hypocrite like I want that I'll be
01:49:02 essentially what minuscule reviews are but like without pigeonholing in it into
01:49:06 being called a minuscule review you know yeah so there you go there's your
01:49:12 answer I guess next question let's see here how deep in are we we are one hour
01:49:19 and 49 minutes okay let's we'll do a couple more of these and then we'll
01:49:23 wrap the shit up okay how do we how we got here oh at oh at rain snow hail hey
01:49:29 what's up dude asks a which member slash friend of the PCP if not already doing a
01:49:34 podcast together would you like to at least try to co-host a show with co-hosting
01:49:40 shows people outside the PCP outside the PCP or is that what they said what
01:49:45 member friend friend oh slash member PCP okay so it'd be I think I got the
01:49:49 impression he means like which other PCP member do we want to have an
01:49:53 individual show with right so like who do you want to do things with that you're
01:49:57 not already doing something did you did you has been saying that me and him
01:50:00 should do something but we have no real concrete idea of what exactly concrete
01:50:05 reviews review concrete there you go shows with I've got a show with monkey
01:50:10 and a show with Nate and hippos the last one who I also want to show with but
01:50:13 yeah it would have to be the right show like everybody else I love working with
01:50:18 but like for a weekly show most these motherfuckers are horribly unreliable
01:50:25 like if like Ben who was actually signed up for this episode and he did not show
01:50:31 we haven't started a weekly show with Ben I just like the reason why I'm on so
01:50:37 few episodes of this show is I'm really good at talking myself down from
01:50:40 thinking that I'm gonna have much to say that will be useful and like I'm the
01:50:44 only thing that really motivates me to like to do podcasting is if there is a
01:50:49 ridiculously unnecessarily elaborate plan like which is why I'm so into doing
01:50:54 commentaries with digi where the idea is that we commentary every single main
01:50:58 video and we say literally whatever we want that is what gives it the challenge
01:51:03 that entices me so I feel like if I was to do a podcast it would have to have a
01:51:07 lofty ridiculous plan like finding the bed like a narrative or some kind yeah
01:51:12 some sort of weird gimmick okay fair point and if you like shows with gimmicks
01:51:18 go listen to the insufferable shows social media argument the podcast of
01:51:22 Jones dot com so viewers do I actually do when they have
01:51:28 no but I'm hoping somebody buys it and just makes it porn or something
01:51:32 fucking give suggestions for some overly ambitious podcast concept that I could
01:51:37 possibly be skilled in in some way hit me up with that we had we had teased the
01:51:41 idea between ourselves are doing some sort of like debate or like idea
01:51:45 discussion thing so maybe at some point we'll do something like that I think me
01:51:48 and Nate are gonna end up with like a bunch of podcasts together yeah we got
01:51:52 Aromango has been going really well we've talked about doing I don't know if
01:51:57 we should talk about some other projects we have like several other
01:52:01 brilliant idea that I think it's one of the best I've ever had so I hope that
01:52:06 it we get it going at some point super secret super secret let's real quick
01:52:14 why don't we just talk about just let's just name the ones that exist already
01:52:17 just to run through real quick so there's the PCP of course there's the
01:52:20 pod D cast with me and give which is the one piece weekly there is the pony
01:52:24 cast which is Jesse and give you know my little pony every week what am I
01:52:29 missing out there's insufferable social media between monkey and digi
01:52:33 Aromonga sensei Aromonga sensei digi and Nate and the naru cost of the
01:52:38 naru cast with mage and mage we're working on an episode to hell yeah there's
01:52:42 rowdy fuckers cop killers which is Munchie and Munchie and Ben yeah there's
01:52:47 the stealing your dad's as if it was easy which is me and munchie yep yep there's
01:52:53 there's the the commentary is it me and DeVoo do which is once a month there's the
01:52:56 homestuck thing that munchie's doing on his channel now though that's none of us are really
01:53:01 it was on there but yeah that's mostly his thing there's a sigh tries to get
01:53:05 monkey into because I is an honorary member right you guys all like readies an honorary member
01:53:12 and uh he's he's what he's part of the uh the like the the sub PCP I have in my head
01:53:19 that there's like like there's there's a secret 10 person like PCP it's like the dark pcp it's
01:53:25 the dark pcp yeah it's like it's like it's like latin still sigh uh um uh who else would be in our
01:53:33 night of the nega yeah i know the nega pcb well don't call me negative that's not as would be
01:53:39 digi we talked about this in atlanta that like it's a fighting game and it's the pcp and then
01:53:43 there's all the like the assist oh yeah they're the color swaps right the color swaps or are you
01:53:46 on the summons yeah oh the summons yeah okay so sigh is an alternate skin for digi and like
01:53:53 nine is an alternate skin for nate which is not an insult anymore because sigh has lost a lot of
01:53:58 weight and probably weighs less than i do now so it's no it's an insult on you digi yeah we're
01:54:03 insulting you digi to compare you to sigh i'm saying that it's not an insult to me because
01:54:08 sigh is no longer fat sigh is even it's more of a personality thing wait well it's not insulting
01:54:13 it's perfectly politically correct all i care is that i'm not compared to a fat guy that's the only
01:54:19 thing that matters to me okay yeah what is it i've got the perfect the perfect podcast that needs to
01:54:23 exist uh munchie and jeff something with them something with munchie and jeff being overwhelmed
01:54:29 munchie would destroy his mind yes exactly exactly digi i just thought wouldn't be great in an alternate
01:54:34 timeline where your friend brandon tollantino kept doing podcasts with you and he was actually
01:54:39 known by your current fans because then he could be an alternate skin for hippo and the only one
01:54:43 i could think of oh yeah oh yeah yeah i was actually wondering who'd be the old skit for hippo but
01:54:48 um uh well i think divu and uh and lockwood skill and lockwood still would be monkey and
01:54:55 i mean monkey would be a main character as well but how isn't locklin tall i don't i don't how we
01:55:02 do in this this relationship okay it doesn't matter okay here's our i don't even topic are we on
01:55:06 right now okay we're still talking about podcasts sharing podcast i forget what question that was uh
01:55:10 doesn't matter here's our last question for the day okay benjamin whistle at benjamin whistle
01:55:15 ash what do y'all think of cars what do you think of our cars but i wish i wasn't bored by them
01:55:22 and whenever because like there was a moment where i was thinking about how there's like this subset
01:55:25 of people who are just like oh yeah that's a 95 honda sieve bitch something or other and i'm just
01:55:30 like man you know whenever i'm watching a show and there's a video game console and i and my eyes
01:55:36 light up and like oh what video game console is that and i can tell based on any subtle visual cues
01:55:41 and i'm like man people who are like that with cars get to be like that all day outside i'm like
01:55:49 that's ridiculous how could you possibly deal with that much stimulation of intrigue also what kind
01:55:54 of literally are you the like cars what else do you like pavement do you like unicycles just
01:56:03 i have what i call car dyslexia any two cars that look anything alike i cannot tell them apart
01:56:09 um which makes it difficult to find my own car because my i guess the the design of my car is
01:56:14 very popular in like modern cars so they all look like mine sure it's very very confusing but you
01:56:20 got the beeper the right that thing you don't have that problem when you only ever drive $300
01:56:25 cars from the fucking 70 yeah yeah but like good old inlet g but uh g brain i mean i can't like i
01:56:35 can't differentiate enough between cars to give a fuck about them but like there was a period where
01:56:39 because my dad runs a dealership he also doesn't give a fuck about cars he just is good at selling
01:56:44 but he hired a bunch of my friends and like you an animal somehow them starting to work with cars
01:56:50 made them suddenly like all about cars like all they talk about his cars it was really really
01:56:56 strange like to see a bunch of like like otaku guys suddenly become like these huge car otaku
01:57:02 and like fucking always like buying forza games and like listening to initial d mega mixes and
01:57:08 shit like the initial d thing is cool yeah like they just got way into cars and they
01:57:12 would like talk about it all day and i'm like how can you even tell the difference between
01:57:15 these fucking things my dad is sort of obsessed with cars um you know he's always he's usually
01:57:21 getting like a new one and like he's like he'll always have like a nice car um at our house so
01:57:26 he'll like be he'll sell the old nice one he'll buy a new nice one he wants a constant rotation
01:57:30 it's like what brings him the most joy in life so that's great and like after he retires he's
01:57:33 thinking of like working in it with a dealership in some way be coming like an amateur salesman
01:57:37 just to make a little money um but like he tells me these stories like when he was a little boy
01:57:43 i believe it was he would sit with his grandpa like on uh like the edge of the road they would
01:57:47 watch cars come by and like the grandpa would quiz him like based on the headlight shape of the cars
01:57:53 it'd be like what car is that and it was a game to see how quickly my dad could tell exactly what
01:57:57 like model make year was the fucking car that was coming and at some point he just completely fell
01:58:03 in love with cars and is just super obsessed what pisses me off is that you can be that
01:58:07 and people think that's like relatively normal yeah they do same with sports like like you can
01:58:13 you can know this like insane autistic level of shit about cars and people are just like
01:58:18 hey it's just a car guy this is just this is socially about anime it's like oh i bet that
01:58:22 guy's never gotten laid you know like those are the socially well i mean yeah that's true though
01:58:27 yeah well putting that aside well that's the reason it's a self-perpetuating prophecy like
01:58:35 the people who are like that with anime they think of themselves as guys who oh i'm into
01:58:40 something weird you know whereas everybody needs don't have to think that you know everybody needs
01:58:45 somebody who knows how to fix a car you don't need somebody who knows what fucking i'm not talking
01:58:50 about people who know how to fix a car i'm talking about people who who just memorize car
01:58:55 shit yeah that's not really much of a mechanic or anything he's mostly just an appreciator of
01:58:59 how cars look and shit yeah most car people don't know the first fucking thing and they all think
01:59:03 they do but they don't know how to fix a fucking car you know i'm a car person i've been this whole
01:59:08 time it's a secret yeah the most well-guarded secret of all time tell me tell me three things
01:59:13 about a car that are true tell me three you can't do it guys you can't do it a famous creator of
01:59:19 the video fuck cars a car person at least just well mate uh-huh i lied just now i lied three
01:59:30 times i love i lie i lie i lie i lie i lie i lie i lie i lie i lie i lie i lie i lie it's about it's
01:59:34 about what we wish we knew that's how you get farther in life that's how you progress as a person
01:59:40 i love cars i i i think they're cool i i i deeply envy people who understand them and know about them
01:59:47 Like I say, I watch like regular car reviews on YouTube. I watch top gear sometimes. I look at car
01:59:54 Like I look at cars that are for sale all the time and fantasize about being able to buy all the cars
01:59:59 If I had a million dollars, I'd be the guy who just like goes bankrupt buying like 20 cars
02:00:04 You know my my dream in life my ultimate goal in life is to someday own
02:00:09 The blue viper that I owned in Gran Turismo 3 when I was a kid
02:00:12 And that's what I've been working towards my whole life that goddamn Gran Turismo 3 car
02:00:16 I want it. I thought you wanted a Jeep Wrangler. The Jeep Wrangler has put a stepping stone
02:00:24 Add that to the wiki folks, that's Canon lore. Yeah, all right
02:00:28 The Aztec that you drove in Breaking Bad
02:00:31 You can do that. That's a cheap drink. Yeah, I
02:00:35 Think cars is a terrible movie. Yeah
02:00:40 I think that cars 3 is a step in the right direction after the
02:00:44 One of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I don't like it
02:00:48 Toy Story 3 was better. Incidentally Jesse mentioned regular car reviews that guys like to me like the asop rock of YouTube
02:00:55 Like a guy who's like so high-level that I can't even completely comprehend it and that think that might I don't know
02:01:01 I've never subscribed to him. I've only seen a couple of his videos, but he's like the most legitimate like
02:01:07 He like he writes like a real classic journalist like
02:01:10 YouTube analysis videos. It's like his stuff like makes me feel weak. It makes me feel like I'm not doing enough
02:01:17 Like I am not a good enough writer if this guy is out there or a good enough man because I don't have enough cars
02:01:25 Cars are cool. I need to get my I need to get my oil change
02:01:31 Should we describe what
02:01:33 I
02:01:35 Drive a drive a Honda Odyssey a gold Honda Odyssey
02:01:40 Shit bus yeah, I drive a 2015 BMW X1
02:01:47 Yeah, you're just helping people out when they're on the quest to rob you because all your shit's in your car
02:01:52 Did you nothing's in my car? I bring it all in everywhere. It's true. It's true
02:01:56 We got it protected
02:01:58 Did nobody hear my my car? Yeah, I just got why you were playing that I was just confused
02:02:14 Remember when John Chon was funny. I remember have we not had a remember when John Chon was funny podcast
02:02:20 You should do that. He's definitely had more than enough John Chon complaining material
02:02:25 I guess that's true. I guess that's true and others
02:02:33 We have some like meta podcasts that have like slowly pieced themselves together inadvertently like so fuck movie Bob cast
02:02:40 That's like five hours long, but it's never been made intentionally
02:02:44 If you're if you're a PCP fan who wants an excuse to listen back to every episode and find something creative to do with it
02:02:51 Snip together every time we've talked about John Chon or movie Bob or like anyone else
02:02:55 We bring up all the time and just make that a podcast. That'd be cool. That'd be cool
02:02:59 Yeah
02:03:00 Also string together all the times at me and digi privately in the car talked about movie Bob with no microphones because it's fucking hilarious
02:03:07 Yeah, it's like really the only thing like hundreds of hours banging on about the same points that he's made five times before with like no update
02:03:13 I just love shit talking people. Yeah
02:03:16 There's no need to hold back when you're not on fucking, you know
02:03:19 Well, I'm not that I would hold back on a microphone about movie Bob anyway
02:03:23 Sure sure like there's just certain people who you just get glatch on to and it's like you just want to shit on them all the time
02:03:28 I know what you mean
02:03:29 You know what you mean and movie Bob's a big one for especially me and DeVue because we have a lot of the same problems
02:03:33 But just to shit on John Chon one more time speaking of
02:03:37 Conciseness I feel like there's some point to be made with his ridiculously slow upload schedule. Fuck you John Chon
02:03:42 Get your shit together be funny again
02:03:45 Drive to that set. So anyway, we Bob guy
02:03:48 I want I want people to bought to bug me as much as possible
02:03:52 To do the game over thinker PZP lecture because I am qualified to do it
02:03:58 And I think I could and it's the only thing I could do a lecture on I only want to do it
02:04:03 If enough people want me to do it though. I'm not sure. Okay, if you press press just spoiler
02:04:08 It will be just me and spirited and bitter no matter how hard I try not to be it's not gonna be funny
02:04:13 Like well, he is fat. So it's okay. Don't worry about it
02:04:17 Well, we're still talking about the cars we drives. Oh, yeah, I have a I have a funny anecdote, you know
02:04:22 Uh-huh. I got the best car, which is also the worst car
02:04:26 I drive around in like a I drive around in an old blue police car from the 70s or 80s just like
02:04:34 Victoria, yeah, but like I don't have like insurance or like a license plate. Oh
02:04:41 Wait like every
02:04:43 So like I've gotten pulled over a bunch of times and now it's at the point where like
02:04:49 All the cops recognize my car. Everyone knows it
02:04:53 I'm the only guy I'm the only guy driving around in a fucking blue police car from the 70s
02:04:58 So every I get pulled over every day and I owe a lot of money to the courts
