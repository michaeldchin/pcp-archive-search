00:00:00 Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:09 I am the main dude, the guy who's the number one cool guy, that's me, best guy ever.
00:00:17 And who we got here today with us?
00:00:19 We have Hippocrit.
00:00:21 I'm the number two guy.
00:00:24 You're poop.
00:00:25 We've got Tom Oliver.
00:00:29 I was going to say number two guy, too.
00:00:32 Oh no.
00:00:33 You guys are both poop.
00:00:34 You have to fucking kill each other then to see who wins.
00:00:39 Actually, you already team up to kill me in the brawl.
00:00:43 Find out.
00:00:44 This episode.
00:00:45 Yeah, the brawl.
00:00:46 Go to the Redcon 2 Royal Rumble to find out who is poop.
00:00:49 You did fucking wreck my shit.
00:00:52 You know, I don't mean to.
00:00:53 Oh, you just spoiled it.
00:00:54 You idiot.
00:00:55 They may not have seen it.
00:00:56 They've all seen it.
00:00:57 They've all fucking seen it.
00:00:58 You know, there is a slight similarity between the ultimate victor and poop.
00:01:04 I do see some visual similarities.
00:01:07 But in any case, let's move on to today's topic.
00:01:11 So this is from a while ago.
00:01:13 It looks like during Redcon, people weren't asking us as many questions.
00:01:16 So come on, guys.
00:01:17 Keep asking questions.
00:01:18 But in any case, this is a topic I thought was cool.
00:01:20 And it is by, right here.
00:01:24 Yeah, okay.
00:01:25 Here we go.
00:01:26 Vitalis the Kid asks, Topic for PCP, what did you guys aspire to around the age of eight
00:01:32 to 14?
00:01:33 Oh, there was an age bracket.
00:01:34 This is like writer, game developer, or Spider-Man.
00:01:36 Well, he said that, but I don't care about that at all.
00:01:39 So just ignore it.
00:01:40 I just like to read the whole thing for fun.
00:01:43 So Gib, what do you think?
00:01:45 Well, I have a long list of things I wanted to be because I changed my mind basically
00:01:50 every time I find something cool.
00:01:52 Makes sense.
00:01:53 The very earliest thing that I wanted to be was, you ever seen Hercules?
00:01:58 Sure.
00:01:59 The Disney one?
00:02:00 Yeah.
00:02:01 You know, the big ice elemental, I wanted to be that because I really like him.
00:02:08 His legs came off every time he walked, but he would still grow him back because he's
00:02:12 so cool.
00:02:13 He's so cool.
00:02:14 He's really tenacious, willing to fucking break his legs.
00:02:17 He's like, ice cool, you would say?
00:02:19 Yeah.
00:02:20 Yeah.
00:02:21 Yeah.
00:02:22 Hey, did you know, Gib, you played Kingdom Hearts 1, right?
00:02:27 Yep.
00:02:28 And you play the 1.5, right?
00:02:31 Yeah.
00:02:32 Did you know that if you go back to the Colosseum at the end of the game, after you've beaten
00:02:36 like, I think like mostly everything else, that guy's a boss and you can fight that guy?
00:02:40 Oh, fuck.
00:02:41 Yeah.
00:02:42 And it's super fun.
00:02:43 It's super fun.
00:02:44 Oh, you can find Sephiroth 2 and he's like the hardest boss in the game.
00:02:47 He's gay.
00:02:48 I don't care about Sephiroth.
00:02:49 You gay.
00:02:50 I just care about the Isolamentals.
00:02:52 I love elementals in games.
00:02:53 They're my favorite trope.
00:02:56 They are?
00:02:57 Pretty great.
00:02:58 Oh, and just speaking of Kingdom Hearts, everyone, my Kingdom Hearts lecture is definitely going
00:03:01 to be out by the time this is out.
00:03:02 So make sure you go to the Radcon 2 playlist and watch all our shit.
00:03:06 There's a big Kingdom Hearts 2 lecture, so go learn yourself some knowledge.
00:03:10 Should I keep going with my list until I'm done and then we'll do the rest?
00:03:15 I think so.
00:03:16 I think so, if you don't mind.
00:03:17 Okay.
00:03:18 It's not too long.
00:03:19 The next thing I wanted to be was a wizard at Hogwarts, because I read the books and
00:03:24 I wasn't yet off age and I was like, well, maybe my parents are just really good at hiding
00:03:29 secrets about this or maybe they're muggles.
00:03:33 It could be.
00:03:34 Like Hermione.
00:03:35 Hermione's parents were muggles.
00:03:36 Yeah.
00:03:37 They didn't know shit.
00:03:38 Dude, I remember when I turned, I think like 10 or 11, I was just like waiting for that
00:03:42 letter to arrive.
00:03:43 I was like, I know what's going to happen to me.
00:03:44 I'm the special boy.
00:03:45 I'm the chosen one.
00:03:47 It's going to be me.
00:03:48 Didn't happen to Ben.
00:03:49 Fuck him.
00:03:50 Yeah.
00:03:51 Fuck Ben.
00:03:52 I'm the, I'm the Lily shit.
00:03:55 What was her name?
00:03:56 He's the Petunia.
00:03:57 Lily Potter.
00:03:58 Yeah.
00:03:59 No.
00:04:00 She had a different name originally before she, I'm trying to describe how I'm the cool
00:04:04 younger one with all the abilities and the prettiness and the cool sister.
00:04:07 And then Ben is Petunia, Vernon's wife, the horrible aunt, you know, that Harry grew up
00:04:12 with.
00:04:13 I don't know.
00:04:14 I don't know the last name.
00:04:15 Okay.
00:04:16 Whatever.
00:04:18 Lily.
00:04:19 Billy.
00:04:20 That works.
00:04:21 Lily.
00:04:22 Billy.
00:04:23 Yeah.
00:04:24 So after I turned whatever it was the age, I was like, oh, it doesn't exist.
00:04:28 Fuck that shit.
00:04:29 Yeah.
00:04:30 And then I wanted to be a drummer because my dad was a drummer and occasionally he
00:04:34 played at our school for various things and he's real cool and I was really proud of him.
00:04:39 And I wanted to be a drummer, but I didn't really express deep interest.
00:04:42 I was just thinking about it as, you know, a dumb kid.
00:04:45 You don't realize as a kid, you got to do things, you just think about stuff.
00:04:51 Then I would, I think it was like 13, 14 where I started reading Mango and I read like
00:04:59 volume three of Dragon Ball and I wanted to be Goku and I wanted to be a martial artist
00:05:04 and the way I thought about it was I would just train like Goku.
00:05:08 I don't need to sign up for like a training lessons or anything like that.
00:05:11 I would just, you know, get asked for Christmas some weights that I could wrap around my feet
00:05:17 and I'd put them on and if I keep them on for like a month and I take them off, I should
00:05:21 be able to jump real high and that was my...
00:05:22 Just like the turtle shells.
00:05:23 Yeah.
00:05:24 That's just exactly the same reasoning.
00:05:26 I thought it would work.
00:05:27 It didn't work.
00:05:28 That's too bad.
00:05:29 I was pretty sad.
00:05:30 I guess...
00:05:31 But after that...
00:05:32 Oh, sorry.
00:05:33 Go ahead.
00:05:34 Go ahead.
00:05:35 Well, I was just going to say, now seems like an appropriate time to say that that was
00:05:38 also my goal and I also bought a bunch of training weights and wore them throughout like most
00:05:43 of high school, little like two to five pounders on my wrists and ankles the whole time and
00:05:48 yeah, I just...
00:05:50 Actually they were kind of cheap and they would spring holes and just leak sand everywhere
00:05:55 sometimes so I would just leave trails of sand behind me wherever I walked and they'd
00:05:59 be like, whoa, there goes that swole kid.
00:06:01 Leave sand everywhere.
00:06:02 Fuck yeah.
00:06:03 One thing that was cool about those weights is that, I mean, they wouldn't let you jump
00:06:08 high but after you took them off, you felt like your knees could go to the ceiling.
00:06:12 You know, you could do like the, like, whoa, I am really, really strong now.
00:06:17 That's true.
00:06:18 Just for like five minutes.
00:06:19 It's cool.
00:06:20 It's kind of like that thing where, you know, if you stand inside a doorway and you try
00:06:23 to lift your arms up and then you just do that for like a minute and then you step out,
00:06:27 your arms just go up by themselves.
00:06:29 It's like...
00:06:30 Oh yeah.
00:06:31 I love doing that.
00:06:32 So I saw the manga was in the school library which is where I found it but nearby was the
00:06:39 how to draw manga and after learning that manga was a thing that you could do as a job,
00:06:43 I wanted to be a manga boy.
00:06:45 So I tried, this is the one thing that I actually tried doing.
00:06:49 I still have my original manga that I drew and I think I mentioned it on Twitter what
00:06:54 it was a combination of.
00:06:56 I made it like a strange Photoshop of everything that was in it and I actually, I kind of want
00:07:01 to redraw it at some point and put it out there.
00:07:04 It was never finished.
00:07:05 Was this an original story?
00:07:07 It was an original story but it was very derivative of a lot of different things which is, I guess,
00:07:12 the perfect recipe for a great, perfect manga that I would have made.
00:07:18 You should redraw it though.
00:07:19 That sounds cool.
00:07:20 I'd like to just see the original stuff.
00:07:21 I don't think I ever saw it.
00:07:22 The thing about the manga was I could not be bothered to start from the beginning.
00:07:27 Every time I thought of like a cool story or something I would just imagine how it would
00:07:31 get to the climax and then I would draw the climax.
00:07:33 I would write about the climax because that's the cool part and the setting up is like,
00:07:37 yeah, it happened, I guess.
00:07:40 That's hilarious.
00:07:43 So yeah, it's just a climax to a story that nobody is ever going to know about.
00:07:48 Then there was a time where my dad, being a drummer, being a rocker guy, he introduced
00:07:55 me to Led Zeppelin by playing the Royal Albert Hall 1969 DVD special thing where he would
00:08:03 show like John Bonham playing the drums real fast for freezes and it's like an amazing
00:08:08 thing and all the Jimmy Page stuff, it's just so mesmerizing.
00:08:13 I just wanted to be a guitarist after that and so I would play guitar from, I think,
00:08:18 age 17 till now.
00:08:21 That made a big impact on you, it seems.
00:08:24 I never really got good enough or confident enough to like write songs or talk to other
00:08:28 people who played music but I can play guitar so I guess that was one thing.
00:08:33 It's funny, my buddy is definitely worse at guitar than you and he is a very shy guy
00:08:40 but he knows a bunch of people and he just did a show is what I'm trying to say.
00:08:44 He was on, he just went to some like open mic thing, him and his buddies and they performed
00:08:48 a little bit and it was original songs actually and it sounds like it went pretty cool.
00:08:54 So you should do that too, it's cool.
00:08:56 I wish I could, I don't think I'd ever really get a band unless I just went out and did
00:09:01 stuff by myself.
00:09:02 You should play with your dad sometime.
00:09:05 I'm sure you'd be happy to do that.
00:09:07 I would want to, I don't know, it's hard to do stuff, you know.
00:09:12 I do know that.
00:09:13 Yeah, I think we are all aware of that for you.
00:09:16 I hate stuff.
00:09:18 I mean this is skipping ahead to the end of my list but I don't really know really what
00:09:23 I want to do at the moment but I'll continue your list for now.
00:09:29 After being a guitarist, I was still kind of wanted to be a guitarist but then obviously
00:09:33 YouTube was the thing and I learned that you could make money off it and my favorite guy
00:09:38 was AVGN so I was thinking, oh maybe I could one day make a video game review show and talk
00:09:44 about PS2 games because that's a thing that nobody does and I eventually have done that.
00:09:50 In between I did My Little Pony as a practice run which was pretty good and then sort of
00:09:58 in between all that, in between the pony stage and before the real video game stuff, I had
00:10:05 to go to university because my parents were getting mad at me for not choosing something
00:10:10 to do for my life so I decided, I like drawing and I like the idea of making a Hayao Miyazaki
00:10:19 movie and just drawing it and making the coolest world ever because I love all the Hayao Miyazaki
00:10:26 movies, the spirit and the way the Laputa Castle in the sky is probably my favorite
00:10:31 just because of the environment.
00:10:33 I just love the idea of just building a world and then being able to look at it and then
00:10:39 it being animated and that's like, oh yeah I could be an animator, obviously I'm not
00:10:43 that good and I probably never will be because I'm not Japanese so I did that for three years
00:10:50 and now I'm done with that and I don't really know whether I want to do animation and now
00:10:55 I don't know what I'm just doing YouTube because I do YouTube.
00:10:58 You kind of got a bunch of possibilities in front of you.
00:11:01 I've got a bunch of possibilities, I don't know what I want, which one I want to be when
00:11:06 I grow up and I'm already grown up just too late.
00:11:12 That's cool, yeah, that's pretty thoroughly answers the question, except Gib, you fucked
00:11:18 up because you specifically said 8 to 14, you wasted all of our time, thanks for ruining
00:11:23 this entire cast, Vitalis the Kid I'm sure is furious that you went outside of his predefined
00:11:30 age range, fuck you, Vitalis.
00:11:33 We're all still 14 at heart, so.
00:11:35 That's true.
00:11:36 Everything up to the manga stuff was 14, 8 to 14 I think.
00:11:41 Well that's cool.
00:11:43 Yeah, I was interested.
00:11:45 Okay, well hey Tom, why don't you tell us about your dreams as a child?
00:11:50 I think the first thing I was legitimately interested in being, I guess I have some
00:11:55 fictitional things too like Gib was saying, I definitely wanted to be a Power Ranger back
00:12:02 in the day because my name was Tom and then the green guy was Tom and that was the coolest
00:12:07 thing ever and I was like we could hang out and be Power Ranger bros and I definitely
00:12:11 had dreams and shit all the time of being a Power Ranger, it was the coolest thing ever.
00:12:14 You're still latching on to that to this day.
00:12:16 To this day, honestly, I still want to spend like $500 some day and get one of those really
00:12:23 good replica helmets of the green ranger and just wear it all the time in public, I don't
00:12:28 even care.
00:12:30 I still want to go to a con wearing one of those and then get the green ranger t-shirt
00:12:33 and just be a street version of a Power Ranger and just walk around like a boss, that's my
00:12:37 dream.
00:12:39 It's going to have attainable dreams.
00:12:41 Give me money, I need $500 for that.
00:12:44 I also like, but in terms of like serious things I guess, the first thing I wanted to
00:12:48 be as a little kid was the guys who drove the big fucking construction trucks.
00:12:54 I had this weird fucking obsession with those back in the day.
00:12:57 I guess it's not super weird.
00:12:58 I've given a lot of little kids like trucks and shit but I was like, that was my super
00:13:02 first like massive obsession as a little kid.
00:13:05 I had tons of like remote control trucks, like dumb trucks and like the front loaders and
00:13:10 the back hose, like all them.
00:13:11 I remember my parents got me like one of those, you kind of like sat down and you could like
00:13:17 dig up shit with it and put it in the backyard and I would do that for hours, like every
00:13:22 day just like in my head and be like, yeah, I'm fucking doing all this cool shit.
00:13:26 So we would see little Tom Oliver in his little drivable car thing, driving around his
00:13:31 own backyard digging holes with his child construction equipment.
00:13:35 Is that correct?
00:13:36 Awesome.
00:13:37 Awesome.
00:13:38 Some of them didn't move.
00:13:39 This one kind of just sat there and you could like dig shit but I had like a remote controlled
00:13:43 like bulldozer.
00:13:44 I remember it blew my mind because it was like super huge.
00:13:46 It had to be like at least $100.
00:13:47 It was so like dumb and I was like, this is the coolest thing and you like dig shit with
00:13:51 it and I had like an army of these things and that was like my thing forever and like
00:13:55 I had all these videos about like trucks and shit and I was like, it was autistic levels
00:14:00 of just like this is my jam.
00:14:02 For a long time, like through like, hmm, I guess once I started going into like elementary
00:14:07 school and started like actually learning actual things that kind of changed.
00:14:11 The next big thing I wanted to be was a scientist was my next thing.
00:14:17 I was super into science all throughout elementary school, specifically astronomy.
00:14:21 Astronomy blew my fucking mind.
00:14:23 Space was the coolest thing.
00:14:26 A child with his eyes on the stars.
00:14:28 It was, I guess so, but that was just like, ah, it was, I don't know, it just fascinated
00:14:35 me.
00:14:36 I liked learning about the solar system and like black holes and supernovas and all
00:14:39 that stuff.
00:14:40 And I guess like, I think Ben might have been in that, into that too.
00:14:43 Like, you know, he works at AstroCamp after doing physics stuff and he's kind of into
00:14:46 it now.
00:14:47 I wonder if he was into as a kid too.
00:14:49 I just wonder because he's not here, but sorry, go on.
00:14:51 Yeah.
00:14:52 I mean, I don't know, I was, I'd always look forward to science class as a kid and like
00:14:56 I guess also this time my dad like is like, dude, you should watch Star Trek and I got
00:14:59 into Star Trek, like the classic and so like space and then lost in space and so space
00:15:04 was a big deal as a little kid, big into like the sci-fi and then like science class always
00:15:10 talked about that a lot.
00:15:11 I remember one time I think it was in third, no, fourth grade, something like that.
00:15:15 We did, we did a project where you had to like create your own planet in the solar system
00:15:19 and like trying to explain like why no one had ever detected it until now.
00:15:22 I love it.
00:15:24 I came up with this planet that like its orbit instead of going like horizontally was like
00:15:28 vertically and it was like orbiting in such a way that our orbit never like crossed paths
00:15:33 with it and that was kind of the whole thing.
00:15:35 I had like this whole explanation for the project, it was pretty cool.
00:15:37 That is cool.
00:15:39 And I was totally obsessed with science and astronomy and shit up until I think middle
00:15:42 school when math started showing up in science, I was like, I'll fuck this and that killed
00:15:47 that dream right quick because math and me do not get along at all.
00:15:50 So that wasn't really working.
00:15:54 After that, there was a huge period of time where I didn't give a shit about the future
00:16:00 and just played video games.
00:16:02 So good, it did nothing.
00:16:05 Just played a lot of PlayStation 2.
00:16:08 Then at some point I was like, I think I got into new grounds and I was like, oh, you can
00:16:13 make video games.
00:16:15 I want to do that because we had this class in school where it was like multimedia design
00:16:19 and then you there's like this is flash, this is what they make all that shit.
00:16:22 And I was like, oh, so I started doing little animations and stuff and flash.
00:16:26 And I was like, all right, I want to go.
00:16:27 Was this in high school or was this in middle school?
00:16:29 This was still in middle school.
00:16:30 I think it was like eighth grade or something.
00:16:32 OK, all right.
00:16:33 So I think I'm already past the 14th.
00:16:35 So maybe this is the end of my journey.
00:16:37 But yeah, animators slash video game guy was the last big thing until like it became
00:16:44 comics and then writing stories and YouTube and all that jazz.
00:16:48 So well, you can keep going and like tell us when that happened because I'm still
00:16:52 curious if it goes past 14, it doesn't matter.
00:16:55 It kind of it kind of it started with with programming and making video games because
00:17:01 that was the big thing I was into is like, oh, I could make these things.
00:17:03 That'd be really cool.
00:17:04 And I had a friend in high school who already knew how to program.
00:17:08 He was making games for like the TI 83 calculators that everyone had to have.
00:17:11 Oh, yeah, yeah, awesome.
00:17:13 So like he knew all that shit is like you can put like a custom OS on this and then
00:17:16 you can load all these games.
00:17:18 You can play all these games.
00:17:19 So like we'd look like we're doing work, but we were just playing like Phoenix, which
00:17:22 is like this like schmuck game and they had like a Mario clone for it and like a
00:17:27 doom clone.
00:17:27 So you're just playing all these games on your calculator and the teachers are too
00:17:30 dumb to realize doom clone on the calculator.
00:17:32 Yeah, it was pretty cool.
00:17:32 That's awesome.
00:17:33 Those TI 83 inspired a world of hackers and late gamer MLG before the iPhone.
00:17:41 There was the TI 83, the original fucking gaming and disguise machine.
00:17:46 So OK, but seriously, I'm really wondering was it even possible to play
00:17:50 doom reasonably well on that thing?
00:17:52 How could it be?
00:17:52 It's no controller.
00:17:54 Well, well, they had they had a d-pad on it, which you can move around with.
00:17:57 And then you could use like the second button, which is like the function,
00:18:00 like a second one on the other side.
00:18:02 And there's another button under that they kind of was generally used for controls.
00:18:05 And they had an engine called the Raycaster engine that did pseudo 3D
00:18:10 like Wolfenstein 3D and doom did, but they somehow made it work on the calculator.
00:18:14 And so like they had 3D FPS games on there.
00:18:16 They worked reasonably well, which is really fucking crazy.
00:18:21 Our TI 83 calculators like standard issue for a lot of American schools.
00:18:26 So I've heard a lot of people talk about them, but I've never seen one.
00:18:29 It's like that just now.
00:18:30 Yeah, they're kind of like you're expected to buy one.
00:18:33 And I remember like parents got really pissed because like a hundred something
00:18:36 dollars and it's just like, I don't want to spend that much on my little kid.
00:18:39 But they're like, you have to.
00:18:40 We have to learn how to use grass.
00:18:41 I mean, I had to buy a calculator too, but they just called it like a scientific
00:18:46 calculator and it had like all the buttons, but it didn't have a screen like that.
00:18:49 Yeah. So the difference is that the the the step
00:18:52 above scientific calculator is a TI 83.
00:18:55 They're called graphing calculators and they have the dot matrix screen is
00:18:58 essentially for being able to plot graphs like you put in data points
00:19:01 and the screen lets you plot the the data and like map like the trends and stuff.
00:19:05 Because there was a lot of like, I don't fuck.
00:19:07 I didn't I never did any of this shit because fuck math.
00:19:09 But that was the reason that the graphing calculator did someone order pizza by pizza.
00:19:14 I mean, killing your orphans and also eating your babies.
00:19:18 How do I know just in time?
00:19:20 Hey, hey, you're just in luck.
00:19:24 All right, hang on.
00:19:25 Tom was finishing his explanation of scientific and graphing calculators.
00:19:29 Yes, super, super fucking interesting.
00:19:34 I wanted to be a scientific calculator when I grew up.
00:19:36 No, that's the reason they were made.
00:19:40 But then people like hacked them and you could put like custom software on there
00:19:43 because they ran programs and so people like, well, programs, let's make games.
00:19:46 So they had like a custom OS you could put in there called Mirage OS.
00:19:50 It was a launcher for launching games and then you could play like Mario
00:19:54 and Doom and bunch of other like shooter games and stuff like that.
00:19:57 And somehow it proliferated all throughout our school and everybody had those.
00:20:02 So my friend could code for this because it was all in basic and he knew basic and shit.
00:20:07 So I wanted to do that, too.
00:20:10 It was my friend, Stefano.
00:20:11 He'd actually he went after high school.
00:20:13 He moved to California and started making like iPhone games and stuff.
00:20:16 So he actually sounds like he was above the curve here.
00:20:19 He he was he could do like super like photo realistic art and drawing
00:20:24 and was super smart and was super rich.
00:20:26 He was like one of those guys like crit hit on life and I hate him.
00:20:30 Right. But he was a cool guy.
00:20:32 So he could do all that shit and I wanted to do that.
00:20:34 So I bought a book on doing programming and it was the fucking hardest
00:20:37 shit in the world. I couldn't understand it.
00:20:40 And I realized that like the thing I liked about games wasn't the gameplay.
00:20:43 It was like the storytelling.
00:20:44 And so that's where like, oh, I want to do comics and stuff came from.
00:20:47 And that is him lasted all the way through a couple of years ago when I realized
00:20:51 I just want to write and now I'm going to be an author and a YouTuber guy.
00:20:55 Word. And that's the story.
00:20:58 OK, cool. Good.
00:20:59 It's a sink.
00:21:00 You got the full picture. Yes.
00:21:02 Thank you, Munchie. All right, Munchie.
00:21:04 Well, Mr. Wise Guy, why don't you tell us?
00:21:07 Why don't you tell us about your dream so we can laugh and shit on them?
00:21:12 No.
00:21:13 That's right.
00:21:14 Tell us. Tell all much.
00:21:16 Reveal yourself. He's still like is in this age.
00:21:18 Well, Munchie is 16, so he's just barely outside the range of this thing.
00:21:25 Before I go into mine real quick, Tom, have you ever heard of Temple OS?
00:21:30 I have not heard of Temple OS.
00:21:33 It's it's an OS based deeply in the Bible and it's and and it's it's based
00:21:40 on two principles.
00:21:42 God is good.
00:21:43 And number two, I can code better than the CIA.
00:21:46 Wait, what what hardware does this OS run on?
00:21:51 The Bible. Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about.
00:21:55 I don't understand.
00:21:56 It's like a computer.
00:21:57 It's a computer operating system.
00:21:59 OK, so this is a computer that runs.
00:22:00 What was it, Mirage OS?
00:22:02 He said Temple, a temple, a temple, right?
00:22:05 Yeah, yeah, yeah, Temple OS.
00:22:07 Right.
00:22:08 Is there anything particularly special about this?
00:22:12 It can run fast and it's Christian.
00:22:14 OK, that's good. It's approved.
00:22:16 It's code here. OK, Munchie.
00:22:19 OK, well, I wanted I wanted to be
00:22:23 I wanted to be, you know, one of those video game.
00:22:28 You want to be a video game or OK.
00:22:33 Then like and I wanted to be that like up until like I was 10.
00:22:38 And then I like saw code and I was like, oh, never mind.
00:22:42 I make them. Yeah.
00:22:45 Yeah. More specifically, I wanted to like like draw the like.
00:22:50 Take that dick out of your mouth when you speak, Munchie.
00:22:52 All right. Oh, my God.
00:22:55 Oh, my God.
00:22:56 Got caught.
00:22:58 Damn it.
00:22:59 I was just sucking off my best friend for San Francisco.
00:23:03 Yeah, because because that's gay.
00:23:06 That's right. Yeah.
00:23:08 Well, you know, I got stay true to life.
00:23:12 I wanted to draw the like like the
00:23:15 sprite sheets for video games.
00:23:18 And now I was like, no, that's gay.
00:23:22 And then I was like, I want to draw like shit, like not like that,
00:23:25 but like still like that.
00:23:29 And then I was like, and here I am.
00:23:33 I've I've drawn both of those.
00:23:35 Sprite sheet art.
00:23:36 I mean, when I was working on Bell with my with my buddy Rich,
00:23:39 I did a bunch of sprite sheet stuff, and it was a big fucking pain.
00:23:42 And it really sucked.
00:23:44 And what I am I I used to take the sprite sheets from Fire Emblem.
00:23:49 The the portraits and the animations and just alter the colors
00:23:53 so they'd be different guys.
00:23:55 You're a D.A. color.
00:23:56 Fag.
00:23:58 Well, I didn't do it for like any reason other than I liked the idea of like,
00:24:01 oh, yeah, if I take the light blue in this guy's hair and change it to light green
00:24:05 and then take the light, the dark blue in this guy's hair and change it to dark green,
00:24:09 he'll have dark hair.
00:24:10 He'll be my original character.
00:24:13 Oh, I see what you say.
00:24:14 That's I was doing it just for myself.
00:24:16 And I was I was just fill bucket in paint like click, click.
00:24:19 Yeah, it's different now.
00:24:21 Hey, we didn't make some great comics with Kirby Super Star ultra characters.
00:24:25 Oh, I want to see those.
00:24:26 Was was that big bird a character?
00:24:28 I forget his name.
00:24:30 Well, you know.
00:24:31 Well, I'm a street.
00:24:33 No, no, this is a big bird and Kirby Super Stars.
00:24:36 Oh, oh, Dynablade.
00:24:38 That's the one fucking cock.
00:24:40 Yeah, it's Dynablade.
00:24:41 The little babies.
00:24:43 Yeah, I want to see it.
00:24:45 A Sesame Street Kirby crossover.
00:24:47 Oh, that'd be cool.
00:24:49 Kirby would suck up his big old going ads.
00:24:52 Kirby would eat all of Oscar the Grouch is trash.
00:24:56 Yeah.
00:24:57 And then Oscar the Grouch would be revealed to be a no-legged man.
00:25:01 Hey, so Kirby eats a lot of stuff.
00:25:04 Does he care about what he's consuming?
00:25:06 Like, does he taste it or does it just get absorbed?
00:25:09 Like, does he only explained in the anime?
00:25:11 Oh, really?
00:25:12 This is please.
00:25:14 There's like a like a black hole in his belly.
00:25:17 And that's that you're exactly right.
00:25:18 Yeah, well, whenever he eats something,
00:25:20 it's transported to a endless and infinite space dimension.
00:25:25 Does Meta Knight have one of these in this space dimension?
00:25:27 So he can never be full.
00:25:29 That's kind of tragic.
00:25:30 That's tragic.
00:25:32 Does Meta Knight also have that
00:25:34 because he's the same kind of being as Kirby, right?
00:25:37 Meta Knight is like a grown up Kirby.
00:25:39 So I guess they like lose that.
00:25:42 OK. Also, yeah, and then they they get on their mask
00:25:48 and then they're like, I got to fucking stop, dude,
00:25:50 like nightmares and shit through the play.
00:25:52 Hey, Kirby is male, right?
00:25:55 Or is it not specified?
00:25:57 No, it's male.
00:25:57 OK, they refer to him as a boy in like every game.
00:26:00 I was just thinking about it because, you know,
00:26:01 like Kirby's got this endless void to be filled
00:26:04 and Meta Knight's got this big rod to insert into things.
00:26:07 So I'm just wondering, you know,
00:26:09 if there's something going on here. OK, all right.
00:26:11 Well, well, well, if you think that stops people,
00:26:14 then you've got another thing to comment more
00:26:18 on what I wanted to be because that's what the podcast is about.
00:26:21 Yes. I also, like for a while, I thought that
00:26:27 I wanted to do claymation.
00:26:31 Oh, I had a phase.
00:26:33 I had I tried to arrange my Super Mario plushies together
00:26:41 and like like cut over and over again.
00:26:43 So I would have the perfect Super Mario plushie YouTube video.
00:26:48 Actually, if you go to the very beginning of my give and take channel,
00:26:52 you'll see like a few animation tests of like stop frame
00:26:56 where I turned my desk into a studio, put a blanket over the screen
00:27:00 and I would take pictures without knowing what I was doing.
00:27:03 That's cool. I did that, too.
00:27:04 There was like this guy on YouTube back in like the mid 2000s
00:27:08 who did a lot of like really crazy claymations
00:27:10 to like pendulum songs and stuff.
00:27:12 I watched that as like, this is the coolest shit ever.
00:27:14 I want to do it.
00:27:15 So me and my friend are going to start, but he never did.
00:27:17 I did a couple of experiments.
00:27:18 I'm just like, it's too hard to quit.
00:27:21 They are really hard.
00:27:22 I think I did a little at some point.
00:27:24 I don't know. This was like a recent thing.
00:27:25 I did one in college to take an animation class.
00:27:29 So I did do a couple stop motion animations in college
00:27:32 and they're actually kind of not shit.
00:27:35 That's cool.
00:27:36 All right, much. What else you got for us?
00:27:38 I also have. Well, the comment on that real quick.
00:27:41 I eventually got my friend on and I need two people to help me move around.
00:27:46 Munchie, I appreciate that you're trying to be interesting,
00:27:48 but making up things about how you have friends is just we're getting away from real life.
00:27:52 So just keep it real.
00:27:54 How like people die when they're shot with a video game gun.
00:27:57 Yeah, right, right. In real life.
00:27:59 Yeah. Well, I guess what I'm going to pull up my rocket launcher.
00:28:05 OK, I'm with you.
00:28:07 Why do you pull out your diesel?
00:28:09 No, I wanted to say that, but then I was like, nah.
00:28:15 Anyway, we were doing a skit where Peach was talking to Bowser,
00:28:21 and then I just say like in a gravelly voice as Bowser, I want to have sex, bro.
00:28:25 And he was like, he shut off the camera, looked me dead in the eyes
00:28:29 and screamed, why would you say that?
00:28:35 Why do you think idiot? All right.
00:28:38 Anyway,
00:28:40 other than that, I was really interested for some reason in the idea
00:28:44 that I could possibly do like be like of like a voice actor,
00:28:49 but not really like like like I didn't like actually like believe
00:28:54 I liked my voice whatsoever.
00:28:56 I just wanted to like be the Lion King.
00:29:00 Are you Mufasa or like the movie like a DVD copy of the movie?
00:29:03 You want to be that a VHS copy. OK, right. OK.
00:29:09 How'd that work out?
00:29:11 Pretty good. I'm halfway there.
00:29:14 I have a murdering part. How was your role?
00:29:19 You're halfway there.
00:29:21 Not bad.
00:29:23 You sound more like the bird.
00:29:25 Two K and Sam, my favorite guy.
00:29:29 I don't think anyone remembers that bird's name.
00:29:32 Oh, you ruined it.
00:29:33 I was trying to think of I was trying to think of what type of bird he is,
00:29:35 but I forgot because Tom's really into the extended Lion King universe.
00:29:40 So he knows all this shit.
00:29:42 That's my secret, Tism. I don't tell anybody about.
00:29:45 So what what type of bird is Zazu?
00:29:47 He's like a he looks like a two.
00:29:49 He looks kind of like a Toucan, but like smaller and weirder.
00:29:51 He's probably some crazy African species of bird that we don't
00:29:54 understand. Tiki Toko.
00:29:56 Yeah, I don't know.
00:29:57 African words, something.
00:29:58 Tell us in the comments what species.
00:30:00 Is a fruit loop.
00:30:03 He's a fruit loop.
00:30:04 Who's a fucking fruit?
00:30:06 In England, we call it toucans.
00:30:08 Really?
00:30:09 Yeah, we don't we don't pronounce it a toucan.
00:30:13 That's interesting.
00:30:14 Hey, why is re-tard England?
00:30:17 So like puns regarding two cans would be like two can play at that game,
00:30:23 not two cans of pecan's or whatever.
00:30:26 I see.
00:30:27 Interesting that in that particular example, he used can for both of those words.
00:30:31 Well, toucan fucking.
00:30:35 You know, I feel nobody, everybody hates a.
00:30:41 Agreed.
00:30:42 OK, I also figured when I would grow up,
00:30:45 I would just be rich not for doing anything.
00:30:48 But I just figured at one point people would recognize that they needed to give
00:30:51 me money. Well, that kind of they would proceed to give me money.
00:30:54 A kind of lifestyle is reinforced in our modern television programming
00:30:58 with expectations of wealth and riches and fame.
00:31:02 How's that working out?
00:31:05 Well, I started out my my journey in order to acquire money by selling
00:31:11 not drawing not like actual drawings I tried to do,
00:31:15 but I just like wrote down on like line paper smiley faces
00:31:20 and I charged them for six dollars a pop.
00:31:22 Dude, that's like paper.
00:31:23 That's like what Fantana was doing, selling his his.
00:31:26 What was it like images of Hillary during the campaign when he's,
00:31:29 you know, trying to be with her?
00:31:31 Please buy my art for thirty five dollars.
00:31:33 I'm a starving artist trying to survive.
00:31:37 And and and that that gumption,
00:31:39 that that that real that real fire in me transformed into nothing.
00:31:44 And now I don't care.
00:31:46 Good. And the world was better off.
00:31:49 Oh, there there was also a brief moment of time
00:31:51 where I wanted to make specifically apple and orange juice.
00:31:54 And I felt very passionate about this.
00:31:56 I like that.
00:31:57 Did you ever want to dabble in making apple butter?
00:32:02 You know what? No, I haven't.
00:32:04 But I don't know what apple butter is.
00:32:06 But I think you and me should team up, become the Hennessey brothers
00:32:10 and make apple butter.
00:32:12 That's been a dream of mine for a long time.
00:32:15 I did a real night.
00:32:16 Your real dream is to be brothers with someone other than Ben.
00:32:20 That's true. That's what I wanted most of all growing up.
00:32:22 One day I'll achieve that. I'm just looking for replacements.
00:32:26 Yeah, you're you're forever on the scale.
00:32:28 You have a very high expectation of your future brother.
00:32:33 Yes, I need you make sure you get the perfect one
00:32:36 because your first one was such a disaster.
00:32:37 That's right. You need to prepare yourself.
00:32:39 That's exactly right.
00:32:40 OK, so you got any other dreams when you think you do, you know,
00:32:45 any of that shit?
00:32:48 There is there is a brief moment of time
00:32:50 where I wanted to be a superhero farmer and kill the KKK.
00:32:54 Now, hang on.
00:32:54 Does that mean that you were going to be a farmer
00:32:56 and your crops were superheroes or you were both a superhero and a farmer?
00:33:02 Both a superhero and a farmer.
00:33:03 OK, I see, I see.
00:33:05 Like Superman.
00:33:07 Yes, exactly.
00:33:08 I'm not familiar with this character.
00:33:10 Fucking plagiarism.
00:33:13 Oh, yeah, he's from a farm.
00:33:14 I remember now.
00:33:15 He grew up in Kansas.
00:33:16 But does he does he like do shit?
00:33:18 Well, he's probably knows how to plant a tomato.
00:33:22 Oh, I don't believe this for a fucking second.
00:33:26 Put it in the ground, cover it up with the earth, done.
00:33:30 Put up with a water on it.
00:33:32 Hey, if there's farmers, if there's farmers on other planets,
00:33:36 instead of calling it Earth, do they call it like alien?
00:33:41 Is that we don't call?
00:33:43 Well, I mean, we call this planet Earth.
00:33:44 So if we call another planet Mars, they would call it Mars.
00:33:47 Oh, I think it's like two definitions for Earth.
00:33:51 Earth isn't soil and Earth isn't the planet.
00:33:53 I think we just called the planet Earth
00:33:54 because we didn't know it was a planet back in the day.
00:33:57 So maybe every alien planet is actually called
00:33:59 their equivalent for dirt, because back in the day,
00:34:02 they didn't know there was a planet either.
00:34:03 Here's a here's a thing, though.
00:34:05 Nobody fucking speaks alien because nobody exists.
00:34:08 Oh, that's not true.
00:34:10 Well, I mean, we don't know.
00:34:11 But I bet aliens be real if we aren't.
00:34:14 Yeah, I believe that there are probably some forms of life
00:34:18 out in the universe elsewhere as if there's big old aliens.
00:34:22 You know, I agree.
00:34:23 That's why you should get the news that there aren't aliens.
00:34:27 There's only Jewish people out there.
00:34:30 And the cause that's the difference is only.
00:34:32 You like because what's the deal with alien food?
00:34:36 Yes, they brought their alien humor to us on this planet
00:34:40 that we just can't understand.
00:34:41 But it fascinates us like Seinfeld, their leader.
00:34:49 The show is the leader of the people in it.
00:34:53 Oh, the show. Yeah, that's a shame.
00:34:54 I don't get on the mothership.
00:34:57 That's why I felt impressed.
00:34:58 That's a good one.
00:35:00 Right, Nate, you're fucking gay.
00:35:03 Shans, I can't think of what to say when I was growing up.
00:35:07 Shans, he was defeated in the in the wrestle rumble,
00:35:14 but he'll never be truly dead.
00:35:16 The under the spirit of the Undertale fandom will always endure.
00:35:19 There's no getting rid of it.
00:35:22 Fortunately.
00:35:23 OK, when I want to be a kid, you know,
00:35:24 you guys remembered a lot more details than I can.
00:35:27 So I can really only remember a couple of things I actually wanted to be.
00:35:32 Like when I was a kid, when I was in elementary school,
00:35:36 I found out about Dragon Ball, the show, actually,
00:35:39 not the manga like Gib did.
00:35:41 This is Dragon Ball Z.
00:35:42 And so like I just got really into being fit and buff
00:35:45 because I wanted to be like a super cool guy like Goku and beat up bad guys
00:35:49 and have all the ladies like me and stuff.
00:35:51 So so yeah, I started working out like an elementary school.
00:35:54 And I mean, I totally fell off the wagon for like years in between
00:35:58 and started seriously again, like way later in college.
00:36:01 But Goku was always my hero.
00:36:03 And I wanted to be Goku, like DBZ Goku specifically.
00:36:08 And like the only other profession I can remember
00:36:11 or really, I guess that Goku isn't a profession.
00:36:13 So the only profession I can really remember
00:36:16 wanting to be when I was that young was I really wanted to be a doctor.
00:36:20 And I believe that is mostly due to the fact that when I was a kid,
00:36:23 I saw Osamu Tezuka's Blackjack.
00:36:27 I saw like the OVA from the 90s.
00:36:29 And I thought Blackjack was the coolest guy and the doctors were fucking sick,
00:36:33 which they are.
00:36:35 But I just I really wanted to be just like Blackjack.
00:36:39 So I so eventually that just manifested in me going to
00:36:44 the school I went to for their biology program.
00:36:47 And I had the intention of eventually like going into med school afterward.
00:36:50 But when I got there, I realized like, oh, my God, this is going to take so fucking long.
00:36:53 There's no way I'm doing this shit.
00:36:55 So when I was in college, so you could because you had such reverence
00:36:59 for breast examinations. What a babe. Am I right?
00:37:02 She's pressure is kind of a babe.
00:37:05 Like she's got a weird mom babe body.
00:37:08 Yeah, I don't I was like, she's the hottest girl.
00:37:10 She's the hottest girl on Star Trek, for sure.
00:37:12 There's no girl hotter than Beverly Crusher.
00:37:14 I'm talking about fucking Stambame.
00:37:17 I don't know what the fuck that means.
00:37:19 We're talking about a second size.
00:37:21 No, shut up.
00:37:22 This is my this is my time.
00:37:24 This is my story.
00:37:26 I space road.
00:37:28 Yeah, I space.
00:37:29 Yeah, that.
00:37:31 All right, whatever.
00:37:32 Well, it doesn't it doesn't matter.
00:37:33 But when I was in college, like I decided not to be a doctor and I did like game design
00:37:37 and then later computer science and then just like
00:37:41 now I'm program and do YouTube stuff.
00:37:42 But that was that was way later.
00:37:44 But another thing I was really into when I was a kid.
00:37:47 This isn't really about like a career, but there was a character
00:37:50 who I emulated even more strongly than Blackjack or Goku or anyone.
00:37:54 This had like a huge impact on me in the way that I
00:37:59 carried myself until like college from from like middle school.
00:38:03 That was when I saw the movie Vampire Hunter D. Bloodlust.
00:38:07 Dude, I that was like my favorite movie ever.
00:38:10 It's it's fantastic.
00:38:11 It's the best animation version of like Yoshi Taka Amino's Hunter D.
00:38:15 You have the will of the D or is that just pretend?
00:38:19 He's well, yeah, I mean, say, yeah.
00:38:24 He's he's just like so that whole movie is.
00:38:28 And even like there was a I hadn't seen at the time,
00:38:30 but there was like a first Vampire Hunter D movie that had been made
00:38:33 as well as like the light novels or maybe they're just normal novels
00:38:36 with great art from Amino in them.
00:38:37 But like I hadn't read any of those hadn't seen the first movie,
00:38:40 but I had only seen this one and just like consistently.
00:38:45 And did you always tell us about this because he's read some of the books
00:38:47 like D is fond over by every character.
00:38:51 There is a scene in in one of the books that digits has told me about
00:38:54 where D walks into a room and it is described that all the women
00:38:58 instantly fall in love with them.
00:38:59 But he is so beautiful that also the men also instantly fall in love with D.
00:39:05 So it's where it wants the D comes from.
00:39:08 Is this where I mean, I I think so.
00:39:11 I think so. Clearly, it has to be the case.
00:39:14 Yeah, the Vampire Hunter D was a big inspiration for René Descartes,
00:39:19 who made famous the D meme.
00:39:21 But of course, it all comes from from Vampire Hunter D.
00:39:25 But all that matters is that he was super beautiful.
00:39:27 I wanted to be cool like him.
00:39:29 He had these awesome gothic clothes that I thought were super rad.
00:39:32 And like I was a little kid when I saw this movie.
00:39:34 We went to this thing in Massachusetts,
00:39:36 this big Renaissance fair called King Richard's Fair, which is pretty cool.
00:39:39 Have you been there, Tom? I have been there.
00:39:41 Oh, cool. It's it's a fun place.
00:39:44 And when I was there,
00:39:47 I happened to see a giant floppy leather hat just like D's.
00:39:51 And it was like a hundred dollars.
00:39:52 And I spent like my life savings of a hundred dollars
00:39:55 on this giant retarded floppy leather hat that I still have to this day
00:39:59 because it looks like D's. It's back in my parents' house.
00:40:02 Well, I can't wait to see it in best anime ever.
00:40:05 Vampire Hunter D.
00:40:06 Oh, I definitely will wear that exact thing.
00:40:09 Oh, my God, yes.
00:40:10 That I have to do that.
00:40:12 What?
00:40:13 If it's back at your parents' house,
00:40:14 Ben has already taken it for his own.
00:40:16 Oh, my God, he's wearing my hat and my shoes now.
00:40:18 Fuck you, Ben.
00:40:19 Give me my goddamn shoes back, you bitch.
00:40:23 And last thing about about D was that D is like a real
00:40:27 the whole movie is D kind of by himself doing shit.
00:40:30 And then he runs into people and he deals with it.
00:40:32 But like he spends most of his time alone and like his hand talks to him.
00:40:35 So like the movie is filled with like he's got a parasite in his left hand.
00:40:39 That's like his best friend and helper guy.
00:40:41 And it talks to him.
00:40:42 It's this weird face thing.
00:40:43 Yeah.
00:40:43 And it's kind of exactly like, you know,
00:40:46 the monk from New Yasha, who has like a wind tunnel in his hand.
00:40:49 It's just like Marocco.
00:40:50 Right. It's just like that.
00:40:51 Only this one's alive and talks to him.
00:40:53 It's it's way cooler actually than Marocco.
00:40:55 It is way cooler.
00:40:56 This guy is like personality and sass.
00:40:58 And he's like, oh, D, you fucking idiot.
00:40:59 I hate you, you little bitch.
00:41:01 But I'm going to help you because I actually like you so complex.
00:41:04 He's a very complex character.
00:41:06 But so like the whole movie, D barely speaks at all.
00:41:10 He's so soft spoken, but he's so powerful and he gets so much shit done
00:41:14 and everyone loves him.
00:41:15 This made a big impression on me as a kid.
00:41:17 And I I stopped talking in class
00:41:21 because I wanted to be just like D and just became a silent guy for like several years.
00:41:29 It lasted a while, actually, until like the start of maybe college.
00:41:33 I was all of high school and middle school.
00:41:35 I really tried to be reserved so people would think that I'm super cool,
00:41:38 but it did not work out.
00:41:41 The world does not work like an anime, unfortunately.
00:41:44 That's when I learned that lesson well years later.
00:41:46 But that's it.
00:41:47 I have a question. Sure.
00:41:50 If you don't have the story, I'm pretty much done.
00:41:51 Yeah. OK.
00:41:52 When did you become a gay faggot idiot?
00:41:55 I guess when I saw this movie.
00:41:56 That's when it happened.
00:41:58 We can isolate the incident right there.
00:42:00 But I watch that movie again.
00:42:02 That light novel Nate officially was gay.
00:42:05 I was just I was just one of these guys
00:42:08 charmed by D's beauty and wanted to be just like him.
00:42:10 But I went a step further and so like in high school,
00:42:14 I was this kid walking around with I had super long hair, by the way,
00:42:18 was down to my waist.
00:42:19 So that was another thing inspired by I've got some pictures,
00:42:22 but it's fucking weird.
00:42:23 I was this kid who wore like death note shirts.
00:42:27 I wore I wore Kingdom Hearts arm bands,
00:42:30 a heartless and a nobody civil on my wrist.
00:42:33 Yeah, dude. Yeah.
00:42:35 I and I wore like weights as well on my wrist in addition
00:42:39 and on my ankles, because I also wanted to still be Goku.
00:42:42 So I was like training this whole time.
00:42:43 I'm wearing all this shit. Oh, my God.
00:42:45 I was a God. I was a God.
00:42:47 I was a fucking king of that school.
00:42:49 As you can imagine, my mom would not let me be
00:42:51 because I wanted to do that.
00:42:53 My mom's like, you're not going out in public with that shit.
00:42:55 That's with this fucking death note shirt.
00:42:58 No, I don't think so, Buster.
00:43:01 If I saw you walking down the schools, the halls of my school,
00:43:05 I would have been scared from my point of view.
00:43:07 I thought you were going to say you'd beat the shit out of me.
00:43:09 But hey, you don't want to mess with a dude with a death note shirt,
00:43:12 dude, who knows what the fuck he's going to do?
00:43:16 All right, well, that's that's about it for me.
00:43:21 Yeah, did we miss anything?
00:43:22 I mean, if we don't have anything else,
00:43:23 we can just kind of jump into questions right away
00:43:25 and just start doing other questions from Twitter.
00:43:27 I mean, that seems like a fair idea.
00:43:29 OK, wait, go on, before you do that,
00:43:33 I forgot to mention that at one point I wanted to die.
00:43:37 You wanted to die.
00:43:38 Well, that persists to this day.
00:43:40 So that would be past it.
00:43:42 Anyway, I wanted to be in 1880s, like Pilgrim farmer.
00:43:47 OK, did you?
00:43:48 I just thought that would pay itself.
00:43:50 That would pay for itself.
00:43:52 Well, yeah, being a farmer is kind of cool if you can sustain yourself.
00:43:56 You know, I do worry a little bit about if society collapses,
00:44:00 that I personally will definitely not be able to survive.
00:44:03 I don't have the skills to do so, you know, that's a bit of a worry to me.
00:44:06 So I will long for that.
00:44:12 Sorry, I imagine myself going up to gang members
00:44:16 and and smart talking them when they pull a gun on me.
00:44:19 But like, yeah, whatever, bro, you're going to shoot me.
00:44:22 I don't even believe in bullets, dude.
00:44:24 Just try it. Just try.
00:44:26 I just have fantasies of that because, like, if I die, then that's what I want.
00:44:29 But if I don't, then I'm the coolest guy in the world.
00:44:33 So you want to die.
00:44:34 But if you live, it'd be cool.
00:44:36 So yeah, OK.
00:44:37 So I just need to find some black people, I guess.
00:44:39 Oh, no.
00:44:41 Oh, believe me, I can arrange that.
00:44:43 I believe Trump is going to ship them all out to England soon.
00:44:46 So don't worry.
00:44:47 Yeah, there will be plenty.
00:44:48 Cool. Nice. OK.
00:44:51 Frosch is not going to allow that.
00:44:53 OK, let's go to the questions here.
00:44:56 Let's go to the polls.
00:44:57 OK, here's one that I thought was.
00:44:58 Yeah, let's go to the polls.
00:45:00 Pokemon. I've been with her.
00:45:04 I don't. Is this question
00:45:05 retired or not? You guys left to tell me by at Josh rushing.
00:45:09 If you could be an anime protagonist or antagonist,
00:45:13 which genre would you want your anime to be?
00:45:17 Josh, you blew it, buddy.
00:45:21 I would want it to be a romantic comedy.
00:45:26 And I would want to be.
00:45:29 The janitor,
00:45:31 who peeps on all the girls and doesn't get anything
00:45:35 and also gets beat up by somebody.
00:45:38 I would want to be in one like Undertale and or.
00:45:43 She's not an anime.
00:45:46 She's not an anime.
00:45:49 That's all right.
00:45:51 That's a good point, though.
00:45:52 That's not an anime, you idiot.
00:45:54 Oh, I wanted to be.
00:45:55 I wanted to be one, though, so I'm going to be a sort of better.
00:45:59 OK, I'll make an exception.
00:46:00 You get to be Undertale, my friend.
00:46:02 Sick, bro.
00:46:04 Tom, this is the origin story of the Undertale.
00:46:06 He wanted to be an anime,
00:46:08 but he chose Undertale, which really fucked it up.
00:46:10 But it somehow worked out he got immeasurable powers.
00:46:14 OK, Tom, what about you?
00:46:16 Well, I mean, I think like the natural first inclination to say
00:46:18 you want to be in an harem anime.
00:46:19 But that's what I was thinking.
00:46:21 That's what I was thinking.
00:46:22 Anime never get laid.
00:46:23 Oh, no, no, no.
00:46:24 That's why you need to watch the best
00:46:26 harem anime of all time.
00:46:28 Anime, anime, anime, anime.
00:46:31 You got your fucking hand on your dick the whole time.
00:46:33 High school DxD is an anime where the guy,
00:46:36 I mean, I didn't finish it.
00:46:37 The guy has not fucked anyone yet.
00:46:39 I'm just saying.
00:46:40 What? Say that again?
00:46:41 DxD sounds a little gay.
00:46:42 I'm just saying.
00:46:43 No, that's true.
00:46:44 It does sound gay.
00:46:45 And now you say it like that.
00:46:46 But it's about this dude who's just got such lust for the puss.
00:46:52 And he's just all about it.
00:46:53 And the girls all get naked and they rub up on him all the time.
00:46:57 And I haven't seen him have sex yet,
00:46:59 but I think he's working towards it.
00:47:00 I think there's real progression.
00:47:01 That's why I just want to be in Vampire Hunter D. Clearly.
00:47:03 We've already established the best that he's like fucking
00:47:05 long-lived, super badass.
00:47:07 Everybody wants to fuck him.
00:47:09 Yes, that's true.
00:47:09 And his hand is always there for him in more ways than one.
00:47:15 You know what pisses me off, though,
00:47:16 when there's a harem anime and the main guy just
00:47:18 does not fuck all the sluts?
00:47:20 Right.
00:47:20 Like Tenchi, like Tenchi Muiya.
00:47:21 What a fucking cuck bitch.
00:47:23 I hate that guy.
00:47:24 Agreed.
00:47:25 Fucking.
00:47:26 That's why you can't be a harem anime.
00:47:27 Because for some reason, like you just,
00:47:29 if you're the protag of a harem anime,
00:47:31 you hate sex and you hate women.
00:47:33 That's true.
00:47:33 That's true.
00:47:34 Which is something that I believe strongly.
00:47:36 So I would resonate deeply with all the harem protagonists.
00:47:39 OK, let's move on.
00:47:40 Actually, I changed my mind.
00:47:41 I changed my mind.
00:47:42 I want to be a fucking, I want to be a porco rosso.
00:47:48 I want to be the pig and be his.
00:47:49 A pilot boy.
00:47:50 Because I like flying planes and I like snorting.
00:47:55 And also the girl's cute.
00:47:56 I think he gets with the girl.
00:47:58 I forget.
00:47:58 Doesn't he get like character, like beast, like beauty
00:48:00 and the beast rules or something at the end?
00:48:02 Yeah.
00:48:02 I think he does.
00:48:03 I can't remember.
00:48:04 But yeah, he's cool.
00:48:06 He has a sad moment with the flying boys.
00:48:09 He's a good boy, porco boy.
00:48:12 Oh, I was going to say, I'd want to be in a sci-fi thing
00:48:15 because I love sci-fi.
00:48:16 And that's it.
00:48:18 What?
00:48:18 Stimple Bible.
00:48:20 Yeah, yeah, that.
00:48:22 And also a witch.
00:48:23 OK, bye.
00:48:24 Anui on me again.
00:48:25 Hello there, Anui.
00:48:27 What procrastinator is the best dancer?
00:48:29 I got to go with Robo Gupta on that one.
00:48:31 He's a well-known, you know, professional
00:48:33 dancer.
00:48:33 I mean, he has shoes specifically made for tactical dancing.
00:48:37 That's exactly right.
00:48:38 How could you beat that?
00:48:39 I mean, maybe if I were to steal those shoes,
00:48:41 I might be able to beat them out.
00:48:43 But.
00:48:43 Well, see, here's what you have to understand.
00:48:46 He himself is already a professional great dancer,
00:48:49 but those shoes make him 12 times better at dancing
00:48:51 than the average robot.
00:48:52 OK.
00:48:54 Well, no one could compete with that.
00:48:56 Yeah.
00:48:57 Let's see here.
00:48:59 Um, some of these are just very vague.
00:49:03 Guys, that's specific questions.
00:49:04 If you ask, like, what's your favorite movies?
00:49:07 That's real vague.
00:49:08 Actually, you know what?
00:49:09 To be fair, those are better questions
00:49:11 for, like, a topic of an entire discussion for this part.
00:49:14 Favorites are not my favorite.
00:49:17 I hate having favorites.
00:49:18 My least favorite thing is to have a favorite of anything.
00:49:23 It's dumb and gay and stupid and list-enabling.
00:49:27 I hate lists.
00:49:28 Fuck you, Digi.
00:49:29 I feel the same way your life.
00:49:31 And I laugh at you.
00:49:33 Lol.
00:49:35 You're sick, Vern.
00:49:37 I do have one favorite, and that's
00:49:39 my favorite method of murder, is what's challenge pissing.
00:49:44 What's that?
00:49:46 You try and piss six feet straight up in the air
00:49:49 and not get wet.
00:49:52 Through what means is execution caused,
00:49:55 or is murdered, exercised in this method.
00:49:58 Well, if you get pee in yourself, then you die.
00:50:00 You have to kill yourself.
00:50:01 OK, all right.
00:50:02 That makes sense.
00:50:02 I wouldn't want to be tainted like that.
00:50:04 That's like, imagine pee roulette.
00:50:06 Oh, no.
00:50:08 Like, you got, like, six guys, each of which
00:50:10 has a drink of various.
00:50:11 May or may not have to pee.
00:50:13 Yeah, exactly.
00:50:15 OK, here's one.
00:50:17 By Elton or aticekiller159, who's got that really cool
00:50:21 escavelier Pokemon icon that I love.
00:50:24 When eating cereals, do you pour the milk first
00:50:27 or the cereal first?
00:50:29 Cereal first.
00:50:30 Always cereal first.
00:50:31 Does anyone do milk?
00:50:32 You have to be a fucking animal.
00:50:33 If you do milk first, you're a common, you need to be shot.
00:50:35 I suspect this.
00:50:35 If you do milk first, it's objectively worse,
00:50:39 because you don't know how much cereal meat.
00:50:42 Like, you might put, like, too much cereal in,
00:50:45 or not enough cereal.
00:50:46 But the point is, you don't know how much cereal you want to eat.
00:50:49 If you put in the milk first, the cereal
00:50:50 floats on top of the milk.
00:50:51 Like, every what I mean is what I mean is,
00:50:54 everyone has a preferred amount of milk-soakage-image,
00:50:58 right?
00:50:59 Like, everybody likes maybe a bit more milk left over,
00:51:02 maybe no milk left over, like me.
00:51:04 And the amount of cereal you're willing to eat
00:51:07 depends on how much milk you like
00:51:09 and how much the milk you need to put in.
00:51:11 True.
00:51:12 So if you put the milk in first, you
00:51:13 don't know how much you're going to have to eat.
00:51:15 And if you have to eat too much, then it's too much.
00:51:16 And you know, this guy at your very best bud,
00:51:19 Declan Khan, immediately replied to that,
00:51:22 what kind of a savage pours the milk first,
00:51:24 the very image has physically shaken me.
00:51:26 He's literally shaking, you guys.
00:51:29 But I was going to say, you know, we all kind of
00:51:31 do have experience with this horrible phenomenon.
00:51:33 Because once you're eating your cereal,
00:51:35 after you've eaten all the cereal, all that's left is milk,
00:51:38 if you want to pour yourself a second bowl,
00:51:40 you have no choice but to do it.
00:51:41 And so we all know what a horrible experience it is.
00:51:43 That milk goes everywhere.
00:51:45 It's a nightmare.
00:51:45 Nobody does that.
00:51:46 I don't know.
00:51:46 But if I have extra milk and I need more cereal,
00:51:48 I will usually always put in more cereal
00:51:50 and then add more milk to balance it out again.
00:51:53 So, well, yeah, but you still have to add cereal on top of it.
00:51:57 I don't actually have the splashing program.
00:51:59 I guess everyone else is just really vigorous with this cereal.
00:52:02 I just pour it in like a normal person.
00:52:04 I put more effort into pouring my cereal than I do
00:52:06 into being a decent human being, which is zero.
00:52:12 OK, here we go.
00:52:13 Here's maybe this will be our last question.
00:52:15 I don't know.
00:52:15 We'll see.
00:52:16 And this one is just a light topic
00:52:19 by Mr. Upload X XG Upload.
00:52:21 Oh, TP Crasnators.
00:52:23 What do you think of the current political climate?
00:52:25 I've got I've got a few choice words for you, my friend.
00:52:28 Pokemon, go to the polls.
00:52:31 It's up to you, my friend.
00:52:33 You decide.
00:52:37 I think Trump's going to be an all right president.
00:52:39 He'll probably not live up to everything that he said he would.
00:52:42 But, you know, that's just politics for you.
00:52:45 You're not in America.
00:52:47 I think that I'm going to think he's going to be, you know,
00:52:51 he's going to be a bit funny, but silly, but a crazy guy.
00:52:54 But, you know, nothing's right.
00:52:56 You are. You are so brits, blaming to me right now.
00:52:58 This is very offensive.
00:52:59 It's going to be pretty fucking shit and normal and normally shit
00:53:02 and shittily normal for everyone.
00:53:04 And it's the world's going to just slowly.
00:53:06 No, no, what are you doing?
00:53:07 You're scaring away our intense SJW audience
00:53:09 who think that Trump is going to be a nightmare.
00:53:12 I really hope Trump is actually going to blow everyone up
00:53:15 because I don't want to die.
00:53:20 Sam, sick, bro, sick.
00:53:22 I think the current political climate can be summed up in one way.
00:53:28 And that is shit is fucked up, but also not that bad.
00:53:33 It's pretty good. All right, sick.
00:53:35 I mean, you are a staunch SJW cuck.
00:53:38 So I know that's true.
00:53:41 The most blue-pilled person on the first of the earth,
00:53:45 the most blue-pilled person on the face of the earth
00:53:47 in the most red-pilled podcast on the face of the earth,
00:53:50 the procrastinator podcast.
00:53:52 It's a match made in heaven.
00:53:55 I got a fucking clear pill, dude.
00:53:57 Whoa, that's just iron-pilled, actually.
00:54:01 Go on. Make sure you research all the,
00:54:03 you make sure you research all the pills that you know.
00:54:05 Because you put the image in the chat, but I was on mobile
00:54:08 and I clicked it and I couldn't fucking see it
00:54:11 because it didn't show it.
00:54:13 Let's try to remember to post this intense pill image
00:54:16 somewhere in the comments or something.
00:54:19 I'll remember.
00:54:20 Okay.
00:54:22 God, we are floundering hardcore.
00:54:24 I think we're all done.
00:54:25 Anyone got anything else?
00:54:27 I could, let me grab one more question.
00:54:30 How about, God, these are all just so vague.
00:54:33 When I was a little kid, I really liked the idea of being God.
00:54:37 Interesting. Interesting.
00:54:39 You know, and I did it.
00:54:41 Hey, you know, I'm God.
00:54:43 The guys who made Death Note are making a new manga.
00:54:46 Oh, guys, it's called...
00:54:47 Life Note.
00:54:48 Nah, I forget the name of it.
00:54:50 I'm gonna look it up while I'm talking about it.
00:54:53 But they, oh, the premise behind it is that
00:54:57 it's kind of the opposite of Death Note
00:54:58 in that like a bunch of angels
00:55:00 that are invisible to most people.
00:55:02 Life Note.
00:55:03 They come down and they visit fucking,
00:55:07 just like how the Shinigami joined up
00:55:09 with an individual person.
00:55:10 Like the angels come down and they join another person.
00:55:13 But now they're all in, it's a competition
00:55:15 between, I don't know, there's like 30 of them
00:55:17 who have done this now,
00:55:18 and they all have to kill each other.
00:55:20 Cause whoever is the winner at the end
00:55:22 gets to become God, which is pretty fucking sick.
00:55:26 Oh, it's called Platinum End.
00:55:27 It's not Life Note, it's called Platinum End.
00:55:30 It's called Platinum End.
00:55:32 Is it the Japanese boat that you wanna be?
00:55:34 What Kim?
00:55:36 Is it like the whole, like the angels come down
00:55:40 and they're all in Japan?
00:55:41 Cause Japan is the only place that has God?
00:55:43 Well, you know, it's the only non-godless place left
00:55:48 in this corrupt world of ours.
00:55:49 I don't know, the only characters we've seen
00:55:51 have been like Japanese high schoolers and shit,
00:55:53 but I only read like 10 chapters, so.
00:55:56 Oh wait, no, there was like a serial killer.
00:55:58 There was a serial killer who got one,
00:55:59 who was a cute girl, who was, dude,
00:56:01 that was pretty sick.
00:56:02 Speaking of serial killers,
00:56:03 don't you hate it when people say
00:56:05 they put the milk in first?
00:56:06 Yeah, I feel like becoming a serial killer
00:56:08 against everyone who does that.
00:56:10 Yeah, dude.
00:56:11 Speaking of serial killers, hey guys, it's me, Munchie.
00:56:15 Hey, Munchie's on serial, dude.
00:56:19 I got you.
00:56:20 By the way, I wanna stop this meme.
00:56:22 We should bring Serial Experiments Lainan on this,
00:56:25 in her opinion, you know.
00:56:26 She's the expert, she's the expert.
00:56:28 That's like my most popular tweets
00:56:30 from last year. It's got like a thousand retweets
00:56:32 or something.
00:56:33 It's the best thing I ever did.
00:56:36 You'll never top it.
00:56:37 I wanted to stop this meme,
00:56:39 that of people not pouring a lot of milk
00:56:41 into their cereal, slurping up the milk
00:56:43 after you eat the cereal is the best part of cereal.
00:56:45 I pour a lot of milk myself.
00:56:46 I'm a milk boy, I admit it.
00:56:48 I admit it, I'm a milk boy.
00:56:49 Good dude, you're gonna drink that fucking milk, bro, yeah.
00:56:54 Okay, all right, we're done, that's it.
00:56:58 Thanks for watching, everybody.
00:56:58 No, you weren't gonna get a new question?
00:57:00 I thought I did, oh fuck, no, I forgot.
00:57:01 No, you didn't, you did. Right, one more, one more.
00:57:04 Let's see here, how about...
00:57:06 Dike.
00:57:06 God, these questions are all shit.
00:57:07 You guys need to step up your fucking game here.
00:57:09 These questions are gay, and...
00:57:11 Oh, okay, here it was.
00:57:12 I remember seeing this one before.
00:57:14 I thought it was a good meme.
00:57:16 Okay, so bye, at John Attenbury.
00:57:18 Clothes at the soup store.
00:57:21 Procrastiners, if you could inhabit the body
00:57:23 of another PCP member for a week,
00:57:26 who would you choose?
00:57:27 And my answer is obviously Mage,
00:57:28 so I could masturbate and then just sleep
00:57:29 for the rest of the time.
00:57:30 That would be all I do.
00:57:32 And I probably experienced female sex for a while,
00:57:34 you know, I'm into that, I definitely wanna do that.
00:57:37 Also, I could do that as much as...
00:57:38 I would be Mage so I could masturbate all day
00:57:40 and then sleep.
00:57:41 Well, you know what, you know what,
00:57:43 if you go into Mage, then I could become you,
00:57:46 and then I would also be Mage.
00:57:49 And then Munchie could be me,
00:57:50 and then he could also be Mage through that.
00:57:52 It would all work.
00:57:52 Let's all be one guy.
00:57:53 At the same time.
00:57:55 No, and then Mage becomes Davoo,
00:57:58 and then we're finally collective.
00:58:00 Oh, no.
00:58:02 That's how it happened.
00:58:03 That's the origin story right there.
00:58:05 I feel like there are a couple answers to this.
00:58:07 I would want to either A, B, Davoo,
00:58:09 so I can understand what the fuck is going up in there.
00:58:13 Yeah.
00:58:14 Going on.
00:58:16 Number two, I would wanna be...
00:58:20 No, that's it.
00:58:21 I just wanna be Davoo.
00:58:23 Yeah.
00:58:24 Well, I would say...
00:58:25 He's a mysterious man.
00:58:25 I would say...
00:58:26 I would wanna be Davoo,
00:58:28 been real quick because I wanted to ruin his career,
00:58:30 and then I would jump out.
00:58:31 It's a good idea.
00:58:32 Just delete his comics.
00:58:34 Oh, no.
00:58:36 Yeah, I would probably pick either Mage
00:58:38 for the reason you said,
00:58:39 just because it'd be interesting to be a girl,
00:58:40 and I don't know what that's like.
00:58:42 Or I'd be Digi,
00:58:43 so I could PayPal all of his money to me,
00:58:46 and then when I go back, I'll be rich.
00:58:50 You know...
00:58:51 I don't know.
00:58:52 I don't like any of you.
00:58:54 I don't wanna be anyone.
00:58:55 I don't blame you.
00:58:56 I don't blame you.
00:58:56 That would be a really good answer to give.
00:58:59 The most interesting person to be is me.
00:59:02 Not me, me, but as in me.
00:59:04 I would probably enjoy becoming Colt Corona
00:59:08 for a little while,
00:59:08 just so I could feel what it's like
00:59:09 to be a good person once again.
00:59:11 If we're opening up shit like that,
00:59:14 then I would definitely wanna be the Undertaler of 5.8.
00:59:16 What do you mean shit like what?
00:59:19 Well, you know, characters.
00:59:21 What do you mean characters?
00:59:23 What are you talking about?
00:59:25 Oh, this is awkward.
00:59:27 This is awkward.
00:59:28 I understand.
00:59:29 Nate, Colt Corona.
00:59:31 Colt Corona's gay.
00:59:33 Oh, no!
00:59:35 I thought he was a good person.
00:59:37 It's ruins it.
00:59:38 Oh, well, there we go.
00:59:39 Forget that plan.
00:59:41 Also, I like how you try to apply the Undertaler
00:59:42 of 5.8.7. It isn't real.
00:59:44 I would never apply that.
00:59:45 He's me.
00:59:46 He's me.
00:59:47 I can feel him growing.
00:59:48 He's with it all of us, really.
00:59:50 Every Undertale fan.
00:59:51 He's a collective tumor.
00:59:52 Every Undertale fan has a little piece
00:59:54 of the Undertaler 5.8.
00:59:56 In fact, there are 587 pieces of the Undertaler
00:59:59 scattered throughout the cosmos.
01:00:01 We have to reunite them like the Dragon Balls
01:00:03 to make the ultimate man.
01:00:04 Oh, no.
01:00:06 Oh, my God.
01:00:06 A goal that hopefully will never be around.
01:00:08 That's what happened after he was defeated
01:00:10 in the Royal Rumble.
01:00:11 He was shattered and scattered throughout the cosmos.
01:00:14 All of his atoms broke off into different arches.
01:00:16 He only has 587 atoms, yes.
01:00:19 He's very, very small.
01:00:20 He's very, very, very non-dense.
01:00:23 What's the, what is it, a dense?
01:00:26 I don't know.
01:00:26 Non-dense.
01:00:27 Non-dense?
01:00:28 No.
01:00:29 Vacuous?
01:00:30 I don't know if there's even a word for that.
01:00:32 Light?
01:00:33 Gay.
01:00:34 Okay, whatever.
01:00:34 Sea-worthy.
01:00:35 Boyant, yeah, buoyant.
01:00:37 Sea-worthy.
01:00:38 Things that aren't dense are buoyant, so there you go.
01:00:41 Okay, enough questions here.
01:00:43 Let's get the fuck out of here.
01:00:44 We're done.
01:00:45 All right, thanks for this, everybody.
01:00:46 Hey, make sure you go to fucking at TP Crasnators.
01:00:50 Yeah, first go to those polls.
01:00:52 Then head over to Twitter and tweet us questions
01:00:54 and topics and shit at TP Crasnators,
01:00:57 and we'll fucking do them just like we did today.
01:00:59 And we need more, so send them in, you little bitches.
01:01:03 Okay, thanks for listening, everybody.
01:01:05 Let's say goodbye.
01:01:06 Bye.
01:01:07 Bye.
01:01:08 Bye.
01:01:09 Bye.
01:01:11 Yeah.
01:01:11 Yeah.
01:01:12 Yeah.
