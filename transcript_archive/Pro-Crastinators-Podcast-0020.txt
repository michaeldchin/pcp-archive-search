00:00:00 Today we're going to look at the term plebeian, often shortened to pleb.
00:00:05 Plebeians or plebs were Roman citizens, and they're often disparaged for being a very low status.
00:00:12 However, this is not actually the case.
00:00:15 Plebs were much higher than slaves, for example, or even people who were not Roman citizens.
00:00:21 They were often looked down upon, especially in Republican times, by the much higher in status, patrician class.
00:00:30 Houses in the city were made of timber, mud brick, and later concrete.
00:00:35 Houses in the city were called Insole, and were 67 stories high.
00:00:39 Hello, are you a Roman citizen?
00:00:41 Yes, sir.
00:00:42 Drop and give me five push-ups.
00:00:44 Whatever you say.
00:00:46 In early ancient Roman history, women were strictly under the control of their husband or guardian.
00:00:52 They had very few rights.
00:00:55 Hey, you my wife, what are you doing out there?
00:00:59 I think I shopped a little too often.
00:01:01 No, no, no, no, no. Today I expect you to take care of the house and do all the chores.
00:01:06 But I was kind of thinking since you'd be home, you could take care of that.
00:01:10 No, you have no say in this family. I run it. You, back home.
00:01:29 I fucked up the first recording. I'm as bad as BenSaint at Patreon.com.
00:01:36 Yes. BenSaint, introduce yourself.
00:01:40 It's 10.50 a.m. I'm hungover, and I have not been awake at this time since I was a baby.
00:01:49 And hippo shit.
00:01:52 Hip replacement.
00:01:55 And, okay, let's get right into the news.
00:02:01 Our topic for the day was plebs.
00:02:04 Plebs, however you want to pronounce it, that's what it's about.
00:02:07 It's this word defined by Urban Dictionary as,
00:02:12 to bring it back, to bring back the old tradition,
00:02:15 one whose inferior intelligence results in them making a complete, complete,
00:02:19 I did that again, just like I did last time, what the fuck,
00:02:22 making a complete tit-face out of themselves in public.
00:02:26 This fails to go into the minutiae of the details, plebs.
00:02:30 So it's a Roman word that was like the opposite of patrician,
00:02:34 meaning one who's an idiot and a dumbass, and I don't give a shit about it.
00:02:38 Is that really what it means, idiot dumbass, or is it more specific?
00:02:41 No, I mean patrician meant like the educated aristocratic class of the Roman society.
00:02:47 Would it be a kinted peasant, like you're just a peasant guy?
00:02:51 That's pretty much exactly right.
00:02:53 Well, that's not how it's used now, and that Urban Dictionary definition
00:02:58 just means that it's stupid, and that's definitely wrong.
00:03:02 You know, I think I just realized that pleb was the wrong word
00:03:08 for us to all cling to, because Philistine is what we really mean.
00:03:13 The way pleb is used now is what Philistine actually means,
00:03:18 which is someone who doesn't understand the arts and is ignorant of...
00:03:23 Lacks appreciation for it.
00:03:25 Pleb implies some lack of appreciation as well.
00:03:29 Yeah, but that's not what it means originally.
00:03:32 I guess we use pleb more as noob, though.
00:03:35 I don't think it necessarily implies that you can't appreciate the arts,
00:03:39 is that you're just too noob.
00:03:41 When I see the thing of this word, I picture two people staying next to each other,
00:03:44 a patrician who's a gay art student at Rhode Island School of Design at RISD,
00:03:52 and the pleb I think of as...
00:03:55 Katy Perry posting rare pay-pays in her tweets.
00:03:59 That's right. That's exactly right.
00:04:02 Okay, so I wanted to say...
00:04:04 I think one of the things about pleb is that it's usually used against somebody
00:04:09 after they've formulated an opinion on something.
00:04:13 If somebody says, I haven't seen that show yet, you don't call them a pleb,
00:04:17 you tell them to watch it, and if they say, then you call them a pleb.
00:04:20 That's an important distinction that I was going to get into.
00:04:24 I wouldn't call them a pleb if they watched it and were like,
00:04:29 I thought that this part was out of character, and I'd say, you fucking pleb.
00:04:34 You don't understand character.
00:04:36 That's where I would say Palestine, though.
00:04:39 That's where I'd pull that one out.
00:04:40 Well, they're basically interchangeable in that level.
00:04:42 So, yeah, just to set it, it's distinct.
00:04:47 We were thinking that it might be a little too similar to Normie's,
00:04:49 but then I thought about it, and they really are totally distinct.
00:04:52 And I've got the perfect example.
00:04:55 As we in the storytelling game like to call it,
00:04:58 the inciting incident for this podcast was a conversation I had with my roommate,
00:05:05 who's coincidentally also named Ben, who I now hate.
00:05:09 Who you accidentally called instead of actual Ben.
00:05:12 Oh, yeah, this morning I was calling Ben.
00:05:14 I called the other one. He was still asleep, yeah.
00:05:17 Okay, so we were driving down the road, we were going to lunch,
00:05:23 and the topic of just anime came up,
00:05:26 which I don't talk about with these guys too much,
00:05:28 because, frankly, they don't know nearly as much as me,
00:05:30 so it's kind of boring for me to talk about.
00:05:32 It's like, have you seen Cowboy Bebop?
00:05:34 Yes, yes, I've seen Cowboy Bebop, I like it.
00:05:37 Yes, 15 years ago, I was a child, actually.
00:05:42 So we were talking about that, and to my amazing surprise,
00:05:46 he had actually watched Konosuba last season.
00:05:49 He had watched it on Netflix or something,
00:05:52 and I was shocked, I was shocked.
00:05:56 So this guy, I'm starting to think,
00:05:58 well, maybe this guy does get it,
00:06:00 because where's this Final Fantasy VII shirt sometimes?
00:06:03 He plays a lot of Vigia, we talk about games and shows,
00:06:06 and he's got decent, yeah, that's right,
00:06:08 if you weren't a Final Fantasy VII shirt, you're a smart individual.
00:06:10 So I'm thinking this guy's got some pretty decent taste.
00:06:12 But then, when I asked him what he thought about Konosuba,
00:06:15 my favorite show of last year, or the last season, whatever,
00:06:20 he just said, meh, it was okay.
00:06:25 He thought Konosuba was just okay?
00:06:27 He thought it was meh, he thought it was okay,
00:06:29 and this is what really did it, when he said,
00:06:31 it was like Sword Art Online only boring.
00:06:35 These are the words he said to me,
00:06:38 and he didn't know he was signing his fucking death warrant
00:06:41 when he said those fucking words,
00:06:43 it's like he put a curse on himself.
00:06:45 So I then tried to explain to him why Konosuba,
00:06:49 I mean, I didn't even get into the Sword Art Online thing.
00:06:52 I just tried to explain why Konosuba was better than what he thought,
00:06:56 because he was bringing up all these points,
00:06:58 and this is where the pleb factor comes in.
00:07:00 He was bringing up all these points about like,
00:07:02 dude, it's just another game, it's just another show,
00:07:04 where a dude gets sucked into a video game world,
00:07:07 and gets all these powers, and meets a bunch of girls,
00:07:10 and they have these silly adventures,
00:07:12 and the lighthearted tone is funny at times,
00:07:14 but isn't as interesting as something like a death battle
00:07:17 like in Sword Art Online.
00:07:19 This is exactly why Sword Art Online is,
00:07:21 I'm not gonna, you know what?
00:07:23 It's a big problem.
00:07:25 You know what he's doing? He's a big problem in the universe.
00:07:27 He's just latching onto the tangible details
00:07:31 of the fact that they both take place in a game,
00:07:33 so he's like, oh, they're similar shows.
00:07:35 That's what most people do.
00:07:37 And the reason why he's doing that is because
00:07:39 he doesn't have as broad an experience with these,
00:07:42 he doesn't understand what Konosuba is trying to do,
00:07:45 and that's what makes him a plebe,
00:07:47 and that's why plebes are the biggest problem in the universe.
00:07:50 And that's where I want to start.
00:07:52 I would agree with everything.
00:07:54 I'm just, I'm imagining myself in this scenario,
00:07:58 and my first reaction.
00:08:00 If he said that to me, I know the first thing I do
00:08:02 would be to burst out laughing,
00:08:04 like his sterical hyena laughter would be my first response.
00:08:07 And then I would probably insult him,
00:08:10 and his intelligence, because I'm a dick,
00:08:12 and I don't have that.
00:08:14 You know, when I'm on YouTube,
00:08:16 I can type the comment and delete it,
00:08:18 but in person it's just like the first thing that comes to mind
00:08:21 is like, ha, you're wrong!
00:08:23 And then I might, depending on how he took the insults,
00:08:29 I would then go into my 50-point breakdown
00:08:31 of why he's wrong.
00:08:33 Yes. That was the plan.
00:08:36 I mean, that also implies that he didn't find sort of online boring.
00:08:41 It's like one of his favorite shows.
00:08:43 He says it's one of his favorite shows he's seen.
00:08:45 So, you know, we got, there's a lot to sort out with this dude, you know?
00:08:48 Hey, I'm curious, have you actually seen Sort Out Online?
00:08:50 Nope. I've seen like episode one.
00:08:52 I have never seen any of Sort Out Online.
00:08:55 So you guys could be considered a little unfair.
00:08:59 Um, no.
00:09:01 Oh yeah, I don't have any, I can't judge anyone.
00:09:03 I don't even care about his opinion on Sort Out Online.
00:09:06 I only care about his opinion on Konosuba,
00:09:08 which I know for a fact is a great show.
00:09:10 And to say it's meh, it's unforgivable.
00:09:14 Like Sort Out Online only boring.
00:09:17 Yeah.
00:09:19 If you guys had seen Sort Out Online, you'd understand
00:09:22 that what particularly bothers me about that statement
00:09:25 is that Sort Out Online is fucking boring.
00:09:28 Like, by far and away, my biggest criticism of Sort Out Online
00:09:32 is that it's unbelievably and sufferably boring,
00:09:35 because it has like this really strong start
00:09:39 where the first two episodes set up this death game thing
00:09:42 and like set up all these high stakes and stuff,
00:09:44 and like episode three is dramatic,
00:09:46 and then after that the entire rest of the show is nothing.
00:09:48 Nothing happens, it's fucking boring, nothing matters.
00:09:51 I think he's one of these guys who is satisfied in a show
00:09:56 by it being, and we don't need to talk about Ben forever.
00:09:59 We can let him off the hook eventually,
00:10:01 but I think he's one of these guys who like,
00:10:04 like the show is about this death game
00:10:06 where like the stakes are really high, like that's true,
00:10:10 and so I think that's kind of enough
00:10:12 for them to be like carried through the show
00:10:14 just like sort of keeping that in mind, you know?
00:10:16 No, what I think about people who,
00:10:18 they don't see these sort of like the boring flaws and stuff,
00:10:21 is that they think that like,
00:10:24 if there's like boring talky scenes or whatever,
00:10:27 there's just exposition,
00:10:29 they've seen that in other things that they kind of liked,
00:10:32 and they just assume that for a show to be good,
00:10:34 it has to have you know, lulls and excitement and stuff,
00:10:38 and they don't realize that there's a difference
00:10:40 between something being like interesting,
00:10:42 but like low energy,
00:10:44 and something just being really boring,
00:10:46 they just assume that that's what this is supposed to do.
00:10:49 I think I know where it comes from,
00:10:51 and you know, because the red letter media videos
00:10:54 on the Mr. Plinkett reviews of the Star Wars prequels,
00:10:56 I think were integral to this,
00:10:58 because when I was a little kid,
00:11:00 I never saw-
00:11:01 The mind-numbing action that the Fran Boris brave.
00:11:03 Well, I never saw the original Star Wars as a kid,
00:11:06 and like I saw it like,
00:11:08 I think I saw parts of the first one
00:11:10 around the time the Phantom Menace came out,
00:11:12 but I saw Phantom Menace like probably in theaters,
00:11:14 and I was fucking bored to tears by that movie, right?
00:11:18 I thought it was the most boring thing I'd ever seen,
00:11:20 and for a long time,
00:11:22 I believed that I just thought like,
00:11:25 space and politics were boring,
00:11:27 you know, like the idea of space politics
00:11:29 was the most boring thing in the world.
00:11:31 I could see why that movie would do that.
00:11:33 Right, and I believed that all the way up until adult,
00:11:36 like I've never been into sci-fi,
00:11:38 I've never been into political stuff,
00:11:40 until I played Mass Effect at like age 20,
00:11:43 and completely changed my outlook on both things,
00:11:46 and now that's like my favorite genre is political sci-fi,
00:11:49 and then I watched the Plinkett reviews,
00:11:51 and I realized that political sci-fi was never boring,
00:11:54 the movie is just terrible,
00:11:56 and like, as a kid, I thought I just didn't understand
00:11:59 what they were talking about,
00:12:01 because it was too, like it was over my head, you know,
00:12:03 but then the reality of it is that it was just bad,
00:12:06 it was just badly written,
00:12:08 and that's why I didn't understand it.
00:12:10 I'll tell you, you know.
00:12:12 There's like, there's the fucking people that kill me.
00:12:20 I think what you're trying to,
00:12:22 or what you were at least trying to say last time,
00:12:24 is that people who watch those scenes in a show like Sword Art Online
00:12:27 think it's necessary for that to be there, you know,
00:12:31 like they think...
00:12:33 Yeah, what I was going to say is that people,
00:12:35 they sometimes feel like they might recognize
00:12:38 that something is like boring and stuff,
00:12:40 but they're scared of like whining about it,
00:12:43 they don't want to be that person who says,
00:12:45 oh, I didn't like it, and then everyone turns around and says,
00:12:48 but it's a great movie.
00:12:50 This kind of American anti-intellectualism,
00:12:52 they just accept that it's like really,
00:12:54 it's good even though they find it boring,
00:12:56 they say, no, it's a good, it's a boring,
00:12:58 but that's okay, you know, that sort of thing.
00:13:00 When you complain about something,
00:13:02 people can find it a real buzz kill.
00:13:04 I have a friend who like,
00:13:06 he asked me, he said, Ben,
00:13:08 you're the coolest guy ever,
00:13:10 what do you think about the new
00:13:12 Fully Coolie sequels coming out?
00:13:14 Oh boy, here we go.
00:13:16 And you know,
00:13:18 I didn't see this at the time
00:13:20 because I couldn't see through
00:13:22 just the red veneer of rage
00:13:24 that came over my eyes,
00:13:26 and I just went on this fucking
00:13:28 bender about how it's all just an
00:13:30 evil fucking...
00:13:34 how it's an evil corporate money grab
00:13:36 and everyone that is responsible
00:13:38 should be in hell and how I pray every night,
00:13:40 and I pray every night
00:13:42 for another tsunami to come
00:13:44 and finish the fucking job and wipe out Japan.
00:13:46 Just wipe out Japan.
00:13:48 Japan's done some good stuff,
00:13:50 but you know, it needs to die
00:13:52 right now before it ruins its honor
00:13:54 by destroying the best thing it ever made,
00:13:56 Fully Coolie with a sequel.
00:13:58 And you know, I could see
00:14:00 the childlike wonderment went out of his eyes.
00:14:02 This was a guy who really liked Fully Coolie
00:14:04 and was like, I like Fully Coolie,
00:14:06 I can't wait for the sequel.
00:14:08 And as I went on, I killed his joy.
00:14:10 I killed his joy.
00:14:12 I saw this so clearly
00:14:14 when I made my Final Fantasy 7 video
00:14:16 which is, you know, very divisive
00:14:18 among the people who've seen it,
00:14:20 where just to raise the idea
00:14:22 that the thing that you're talking about,
00:14:24 like, because my whole life,
00:14:26 me and my friend Colin, when we were kids,
00:14:28 made a pledge that we would do whatever it takes
00:14:30 because we were young, we didn't have any money
00:14:32 to get whatever money was required
00:14:34 to buy the console
00:14:36 or whatever we needed to play the Final Fantasy 7
00:14:38 remake when it came out.
00:14:40 And that was from a time...
00:14:42 A tall order.
00:14:44 At that time, we didn't know if that was even going to be fucking possible,
00:14:46 but we just like...
00:14:48 It was something that we just
00:14:50 blindly believed would be the best thing ever
00:14:52 because it was like our favorite game
00:14:54 and we trusted Square Enix
00:14:56 and we didn't understand how these things happen.
00:14:58 But now that we're older, I mean, I don't know about him,
00:15:00 but I understand
00:15:02 that's just not how things are going to pan out.
00:15:04 It's not going to be, you know,
00:15:06 what I expected to be.
00:15:08 It's going to be, you know, this whole other thing.
00:15:10 It's going to be its own thing.
00:15:12 You only know that
00:15:14 if you have the perspective
00:15:16 of someone who like understands how these things happen.
00:15:18 So that's where being a plebe
00:15:20 will shoot you in the foot because you encourage
00:15:22 bad things to happen without even knowing you're doing it.
00:15:24 Here's the thing that I think is
00:15:26 not necessarily the same as being a plebe.
00:15:28 And I'm aware this comes off as the most condescending podcast
00:15:30 that I've ever done, definitely.
00:15:32 I think Normies was pretty close, pretty up there.
00:15:34 Here's the thing that's not necessarily the same
00:15:36 as being a plebe, but I think it can be related.
00:15:38 A lot of people don't
00:15:40 want to
00:15:42 see anything negatively.
00:15:44 They want to be excited about things
00:15:46 and they want to like things.
00:15:48 We could just make this about
00:15:50 how people don't appreciate negativity enough.
00:15:52 That could be like the theme of this.
00:15:54 You know, I think if I wanted to speak
00:15:56 in defense of
00:15:58 like,
00:16:00 plebness is like ignorance is bliss, right?
00:16:02 That's right, that's right.
00:16:04 The less you think about it, the more you can enjoy it.
00:16:06 And I think that...
00:16:08 Well, I think there's a double-edged sword
00:16:10 with being a pleb.
00:16:12 Which is that if you just
00:16:14 like everything
00:16:16 because I see this sometimes
00:16:18 where there's people who aren't very critical.
00:16:20 People who give everything like a 7 out of 10.
00:16:22 Or a 10 out of 10.
00:16:24 They give everything this baseline.
00:16:26 It's either amazing or it's good.
00:16:28 But then the difference between those
00:16:30 isn't even that strong.
00:16:32 I feel like when people
00:16:34 aren't very critical of stuff, then everything
00:16:36 is just kind of the same.
00:16:38 They kind of watch something and they go,
00:16:40 oh, it was great. And then for all time,
00:16:42 they just go, oh, it was great.
00:16:44 But they never experience more.
00:16:46 Whereas for me,
00:16:48 because I'm so critical of some stuff,
00:16:50 then the stuff that I do
00:16:52 I like way more.
00:16:54 For something to
00:16:56 break down all those barriers
00:16:58 of things that it can do wrong.
00:17:00 For a show to just
00:17:02 not fuck up in any way.
00:17:04 And then to just excel
00:17:06 in certain ways is like mind
00:17:08 blowing to me. It's like I can't believe
00:17:10 this is really happening.
00:17:12 That genius and beauty
00:17:14 exist in the world.
00:17:16 You know what I am?
00:17:18 I am Matt
00:17:20 Genius and beauty is like a rare pepe.
00:17:22 Yeah.
00:17:24 Posted by Katy Perry for all to enjoy.
00:17:26 I can't believe.
00:17:28 Yeah, anyway.
00:17:30 I'm like Matt Damon from
00:17:32 Good Will Hunting.
00:17:34 No, actually I'm not Matt Damon.
00:17:36 I'm like Skarsgard.
00:17:38 I'm the professor
00:17:40 who discovered Matt Damon.
00:17:42 The genius kid.
00:17:44 Well, it's like this.
00:17:46 It's like there's only a few men in the world
00:17:48 who can tell the difference between you and me.
00:17:50 But I'm one of them.
00:17:52 And you know, it's like you gotta know
00:17:54 you gotta be able to see the difference
00:17:56 between Sword Art Online and fucking Konosuba
00:17:58 if you wanna survive meeting me.
00:18:00 You say that to me again.
00:18:02 I would
00:18:04 consider myself a bit of a
00:18:06 pleb in a
00:18:08 few ways. I mean,
00:18:10 because like I try to be
00:18:12 it's not that I try to be
00:18:14 optimistic all the time.
00:18:16 I actually enjoy being really critical
00:18:18 on things that people like.
00:18:20 But that's just because I'm
00:18:22 lost the word.
00:18:24 Contrarian, yeah.
00:18:26 But I do like
00:18:28 just giving things
00:18:30 letting things
00:18:32 you know, just
00:18:34 I'm accepting of things that
00:18:36 like people in this chat
00:18:38 in this group really
00:18:40 all rag on. Like I'm still
00:18:42 kind of like Nerdwriter and all that stuff.
00:18:44 I like Nerdwriter. Well, I know you do
00:18:46 but like everyone else. I don't care
00:18:48 for him personally.
00:18:50 And even though I hate Dark Souls 2
00:18:52 a lot, I still don't think I hate
00:18:54 as much as you do now, did you?
00:18:56 I don't think anybody hates as much as I do.
00:18:58 Yeah.
00:19:00 You've overtaken me there. I don't know.
00:19:02 I just I've considered myself
00:19:04 a pleb maybe because
00:19:06 as a defense mechanism.
00:19:08 Well, I don't want to be.
00:19:10 Here's the thing. Here's what I think.
00:19:12 There's no such thing as plebs
00:19:14 because nothing in this world
00:19:16 is truly worth appreciating at all.
00:19:18 All right.
00:19:20 So some people think
00:19:22 they have a real good nose or taste
00:19:24 or whatever for beer.
00:19:26 But they're wrong. They've been tricked
00:19:28 by big, by big alcohol companies.
00:19:30 The culture of
00:19:32 beer is one that's like, oh this,
00:19:34 I mean, beers do taste different, but none of them
00:19:36 taste good. And all
00:19:38 artists like that. None of it's really good.
00:19:40 You've just been tricked into thinking you like it
00:19:42 by the media and by marketing.
00:19:44 So plebs are...
00:19:46 To a certain extent. No, completely.
00:19:48 I like Guinness.
00:19:50 I think Guinness tastes good now. Now that I've drank
00:19:52 it so many times, I just like to drink it.
00:19:54 I guess there are better and worse beers.
00:19:56 I know what you're saying. For the most part,
00:19:58 it's about, I mean, you could like anyone.
00:20:00 People like getting tied to the railing
00:20:02 and raped. If you do it enough times.
00:20:04 They learn to like it.
00:20:06 Do they?
00:20:08 Are you sure? I can confirm that.
00:20:10 Yeah, no.
00:20:12 So we've just
00:20:14 all got Stockholm syndrome
00:20:16 to art. Art and culture just
00:20:18 have us all fucking hostage.
00:20:20 It's funny.
00:20:22 I actually think that a lot of people
00:20:24 like a lot of stuff
00:20:26 out of Stockholm syndrome
00:20:28 because of... Absolutely.
00:20:30 I'm not kidding about that.
00:20:32 That's essentially the argument we were having
00:20:34 about Sword Art Online and
00:20:36 that those first two episodes
00:20:38 were so gripping that people will watch
00:20:40 the whole fucking show and no matter how
00:20:42 stupid and boring it gets, they
00:20:44 might just... That's what Attack on Titan did to me.
00:20:46 That's what Attack on Titan did to me.
00:20:48 It just hooked me really hard at the beginning.
00:20:50 I think like the greatest cultural
00:20:52 example of that in recent years was
00:20:54 The Walking Dead. That like
00:20:56 it had this really strong first season
00:20:58 but that was only like six episodes
00:21:00 and then it's just been like painfully boring
00:21:02 for like five fucking seasons.
00:21:04 Yeah, but it's culture. But it was enough, man.
00:21:06 That's all they need to do and now they've got it.
00:21:08 I want to see how it ends or whatever. Right.
00:21:10 Yeah, who gives a shit, they all fucking die.
00:21:12 Everyone dies. Spoiler alert.
00:21:14 My parents who are not like particularly
00:21:16 critical or picky and even they like
00:21:18 by season three were like this show's fucking
00:21:20 dumb as fuck. But they're still watching it
00:21:22 because they cannot, you know.
00:21:24 Yeah, now they're invested. That's what they do.
00:21:26 They get you invested in the characters
00:21:28 and they numb your like
00:21:30 critical thinking and then they just like find
00:21:32 a... At first they
00:21:34 tap into like your...
00:21:36 There's like a base human reaction to like
00:21:38 oh shit, things are happening to these people.
00:21:40 Are they gonna be okay? They get you with that
00:21:42 and then they build a little bit of like
00:21:44 narrative weight into it. They build like a
00:21:46 thread line. They make you relate to these people
00:21:48 and they get you invested in them personally.
00:21:50 And then at that point they can do whatever the fuck they want.
00:21:52 It doesn't matter. You're already got.
00:21:54 It's what happened to me with Naruto and Bleach.
00:21:56 I still read them even though I don't like...
00:21:58 Well, Naruto's finished.
00:22:00 But I read it all the way to the end even though like...
00:22:02 Oh, well, who cares.
00:22:04 I don't need to get invested in the new characters.
00:22:06 I've done my bit.
00:22:08 I've seen how it ends.
00:22:10 And now I can never look at it again.
00:22:12 I'm glad I don't have this impulse.
00:22:14 Because for me,
00:22:16 I guess it's because
00:22:18 it's very all or nothing
00:22:20 with me because most shows aren't over
00:22:22 when I start watching them and then I
00:22:24 catch up and then I just never watch it again.
00:22:26 Well, reading Naruto
00:22:28 wasn't too much of like a hassle.
00:22:30 I would always go to the
00:22:32 manga sites to read the new one piece chapter
00:22:34 and there's usually a Naruto there as well.
00:22:36 Yes, there is.
00:22:38 I do have the strong urge
00:22:40 to finish like anything that I start.
00:22:42 But to balance that out
00:22:44 is I don't start things very often.
00:22:46 It takes multiple
00:22:48 separate people independently
00:22:50 recommending me something for me to even think
00:22:52 about watching it.
00:22:54 I gotta ask, is this weird
00:22:56 that I think the reason I don't feel the need
00:22:58 to continue is that I feel like no matter what
00:23:00 what happens is either they die
00:23:02 or they don't die.
00:23:04 Yes, that's weird.
00:23:06 That's always what it comes down to.
00:23:08 They don't die by the end of the story.
00:23:10 But that's life.
00:23:12 And adding on to that
00:23:14 they will eventually die.
00:23:16 So like even then, none of it
00:23:18 fucking matters, you know.
00:23:20 This is the part where I
00:23:22 showed up in the call.
00:23:24 Well, I wanted to go back to the
00:23:26 sort of the idea that people
00:23:28 are afraid of
00:23:30 being judged for being critical.
00:23:34 And I want to bring in the new
00:23:36 Harry and Original term from the Hello Internet
00:23:38 podcast, cheer pressure.
00:23:40 Which is where there's pressure
00:23:42 to be constantly
00:23:44 positive
00:23:46 to all things.
00:23:48 Do you say cheer pressure?
00:23:50 You gotta be cheering for them.
00:23:52 You can't possibly...
00:23:54 We've all had people
00:23:56 attack us for being against...
00:23:58 Oh god, I'm seeing red! You just reminded me of the thing
00:24:00 the angriest I've ever been.
00:24:02 Okay, that's totally relevant.
00:24:04 Because yesterday,
00:24:06 when Digi did his fuck, he did a video
00:24:08 that was like criticizing
00:24:10 boring tastes of anime.
00:24:12 I swear I'm in a fucking murky old family.
00:24:14 I've never been more angry in my life.
00:24:16 Who are you talking to?
00:24:18 Anime every day is who he's talking to.
00:24:20 It's not him.
00:24:22 He makes this response
00:24:24 about how Digi isn't allowed
00:24:26 to criticize things.
00:24:28 Because he has a fucking platform,
00:24:30 people are gonna not like
00:24:32 things that he says he doesn't like.
00:24:34 And that is not fucking allowed.
00:24:36 You can't do that. You're spreading a cancer.
00:24:38 You're spreading dislike of something.
00:24:40 Oh my god, fuck off you piece of shit!
00:24:42 I wish you were dead! That's the most retarded thing
00:24:44 I've ever heard in my entire fucking life.
00:24:46 Oh god, I'm so mad.
00:24:48 So this guy said that
00:24:50 it's irresponsible of you to say that things are bad
00:24:52 because it'll make people like them less?
00:24:54 That's what he was saying.
00:24:56 What community have I heard
00:24:58 that kind of argument in?
00:25:00 Wait, wait, hold on.
00:25:02 What anime every day was saying was that
00:25:04 you're judging people by their tastes,
00:25:06 but you think that people shouldn't be judged by their taste at all.
00:25:08 It's not so much being judged
00:25:10 by your taste.
00:25:12 Digi didn't even judge anyone taste.
00:25:14 He says every fucking time that you can like any show you want.
00:25:16 It's more like this.
00:25:18 This isn't what it's like.
00:25:20 Why doesn't he understand?
00:25:22 Look, what it really is is
00:25:24 evaluating people's tastes.
00:25:26 You look at your favorites and you go,
00:25:28 it seems like you're into this kind of thing.
00:25:30 So it's not him saying
00:25:32 some people have worse tastes
00:25:34 than other people.
00:25:36 It's just saying, he's just saying that me personally
00:25:38 some tastes bore me because I'm
00:25:40 unfortunate all the time.
00:25:42 Did you say he's bored?
00:25:44 I'm right now looking at this reply I got to a comment
00:25:46 on that video that was like,
00:25:48 why can't you just admit Digi bro fucked up?
00:25:50 Why can't you just admit it that he
00:25:52 lapsed in judgment?
00:25:54 I'm gonna give this guy a response.
00:25:56 You know what, I didn't
00:25:58 want to bring this up but it's
00:26:00 out now so whatever.
00:26:02 Congratulations, you now have your first public beef
00:26:04 in the anime community.
00:26:06 Yeah, great.
00:26:08 I completely understand
00:26:10 where all these people
00:26:12 are coming from because like
00:26:14 in this chat
00:26:16 where we do these calls
00:26:18 we shit on people's tastes
00:26:20 all the time but when we
00:26:22 shit on people's tastes we don't mean it in the same way as
00:26:24 some people mean it
00:26:26 when some people are like
00:26:28 if you're like K-On, you're completely retarded
00:26:30 that show has no substance whatsoever.
00:26:32 Oh, I wonder if you're really good at
00:26:34 face stuff actually.
00:26:36 So people like that, when they say that
00:26:38 You guys can almost compete with mine but you have to
00:26:40 have a shitty echo effect to really make it sound
00:26:42 sounds like an evil thing.
00:26:44 You got to cop the mic.
00:26:46 I think you're gonna speed it up 10%.
00:26:48 So anyway, when he says that it doesn't mean
00:26:50 the same thing as when we are like
00:26:52 why does such and such continue
00:26:54 to shit on such and such
00:26:56 thing that we like. When we say it
00:26:58 it means a different thing. You're just gonna have to take our word for it guys.
00:27:00 You're just gonna have to take our word for it.
00:27:02 The reason that I
00:27:04 because I know Nate you didn't like that
00:27:06 in my response I was
00:27:08 overly fair to him.
00:27:10 You were so fair and it made me so mad.
00:27:12 You should have ripped him apart. The only reason for that is
00:27:14 the realization I had when I was watching his video
00:27:16 and he kind of makes this point
00:27:18 that those shows
00:27:20 that I'm talking about are mostly
00:27:22 kind of obscure shows
00:27:24 and like
00:27:26 I think the problem is that
00:27:28 from my perspective all I see these
00:27:30 like the only times I ever see these shows talked about
00:27:32 is in fucking 3 by 3 threads.
00:27:34 It's when people are putting them on their favorites list
00:27:36 because they make you look really smart and cool.
00:27:38 But then I thought about it and I was like
00:27:40 no one's championing these on
00:27:42 YouTube except for this guy.
00:27:44 Like anywhere else for me
00:27:46 anywhere else on the internet it's annoying
00:27:48 to see like a million anime
00:27:50 every day is going oh this show
00:27:52 is so beautiful and that makes
00:27:54 it the best show that I've ever seen
00:27:56 and I'm like yeah I fucking get it.
00:27:58 But then I thought about it and I'm like well
00:28:00 there's no video of me on my channel
00:28:02 going hey guys go watch Anne of Green
00:28:04 Gables because it's a classic.
00:28:06 And so if
00:28:08 I had more videos
00:28:10 about those shows then I would really
00:28:12 feel like he completely
00:28:14 deserved to be ragged on.
00:28:16 If you guys are just now hearing about all this
00:28:18 believe me like if you hearing us talk about this
00:28:20 for the first time it may sound
00:28:22 like Digi made some video where he's like
00:28:24 hey everyone I'm here to tell you about who to not
00:28:26 take seriously around here. It wasn't like that
00:28:28 at all it was more like a thought experiment
00:28:30 it was sort of like I don't know
00:28:32 you just have to...
00:28:34 Don't defend it it doesn't need a defense
00:28:36 it was just a fucking whatever.
00:28:38 It was just like a thought experiment type of thing
00:28:40 and I understand that people don't like
00:28:42 understand the depth of where we're coming from
00:28:44 I don't know
00:28:46 It was a video that wasn't meant to be
00:28:48 watched by as many people as it was
00:28:50 it's really what it comes down to.
00:28:52 It's a video that has 30,000 views
00:28:54 that was just a random rambling
00:28:56 I mean you did give it a really click baby
00:28:58 title and a thumbnail even.
00:29:00 I don't know why I did that because in retrospect
00:29:02 that made no sense because I did
00:29:04 the title I had in mind from the beginning
00:29:06 but I did give it a thumbnail
00:29:08 like this will get more clicks
00:29:10 and then I looked at it and I mean
00:29:12 I meant to get more clicks
00:29:14 I'm not sure I even agree with the argument
00:29:16 that like I didn't intend this to be seen by more people
00:29:18 because once you post it out it's out
00:29:20 but like nonetheless I think your points
00:29:22 are nothing to be argued
00:29:24 This reminds me
00:29:26 Here's my thing about this is that like
00:29:28 he's talking about a vague generalization
00:29:30 and if you feel like
00:29:32 you aren't like posturing with your opinions
00:29:34 then you aren't part of that group
00:29:36 and you don't have to like be defensive about it
00:29:38 like if you feel like you aren't part of that group
00:29:40 then you aren't.
00:29:42 Well I did literally call him
00:29:44 being out.
00:29:46 If you get called out then you can make a response
00:29:48 what I told him was
00:29:50 you should have just made a response proving
00:29:52 all your favorites are better than everything else
00:29:54 I also thought that's what it was going to be
00:29:56 like when I clicked on the video I was really hoping
00:29:58 he was about to like play defense for the show
00:30:00 That would have made you look way stupider
00:30:02 When I saw that the video was only 8 minutes long
00:30:04 I figured there was no way
00:30:06 he could defend 9 choices
00:30:08 His response to me was
00:30:10 well I have, I explain it all in my videos
00:30:12 themselves. I'm like oh well
00:30:14 I don't want to hunt down all of his videos
00:30:16 so I'll just take his word for it
00:30:18 Let's move this into a discussion
00:30:20 of another kind of pleb
00:30:22 and once again I'm just accusing
00:30:24 anime every day of something
00:30:26 so I'm just throwing the pot even more
00:30:28 Whatever let him have it
00:30:30 I think that the fact that
00:30:32 he thinks he's put up a defense of
00:30:34 why those shows are on his list
00:30:36 is exactly the problem
00:30:38 of why I made that video
00:30:40 in the first place
00:30:42 because he hasn't really
00:30:44 not in any depth
00:30:46 or meaningful way
00:30:48 he's talked a lot about how they're
00:30:50 very well written and beautiful to look at
00:30:52 and the art design is really strong
00:30:54 Is that really his voice?
00:30:56 I haven't seen his videos
00:30:58 That's sort of his voice
00:31:00 I know he's capable of
00:31:02 making analytical points
00:31:04 in the film
00:31:06 and arise
00:31:08 and made some great points in those videos
00:31:10 but most of his videos
00:31:12 are like
00:31:14 these are the top 10 anime of 1990
00:31:16 and then he'll just
00:31:18 just describe
00:31:20 they're kind of like YMS reviews
00:31:22 where he's just describing the fact that
00:31:24 the show is good and not why it's good
00:31:26 in any specific
00:31:28 kind of detail
00:31:30 and my problem with those 3x3s
00:31:32 this is what I was trying to get across
00:31:34 about ergo proxy
00:31:36 is that I don't understand the appeal of ergo proxy
00:31:38 and no one has explained it to me
00:31:40 well enough that I get it
00:31:42 it is like
00:31:44 proven
00:31:46 that in some fields at least
00:31:48 people will posture for
00:31:50 a sophisticated looking opinion
00:31:52 I remember Jimquisition talking about that
00:31:54 in regards to certain features on video games
00:31:56 but also correlating it to coffee
00:31:58 how statistics show that
00:32:00 when people are interviewed they say
00:32:02 I like a rich dark roast of coffee
00:32:04 but then buying habits suggest
00:32:06 that people mostly buy milky weak coffee
00:32:08 you know it's not like
00:32:10 the very notion he's proposing
00:32:12 that people don't
00:32:14 just put things on there to look smart
00:32:16 or cool is the most retarded thing
00:32:18 I've ever heard in my life
00:32:20 even if like
00:32:22 we love everyone
00:32:24 we're the most positive people ever
00:32:26 we're not saying you're not a good person
00:32:28 we're extremely cynical
00:32:30 and that's the issue
00:32:32 is that I don't think he's cynical enough about it
00:32:34 because I got a lot of responses
00:32:36 we're just saying we don't automatically dislike anyone
00:32:38 for anything
00:32:40 we're not saying you're a bad person
00:32:42 we're not saying you're not allowed to watch anime
00:32:44 I personally don't care about this whole boring taste thing
00:32:46 because I'm not on 4chan all the time
00:32:48 just letting you know
00:32:50 please don't take it too seriously
00:32:52 it's just like a thought experiment or something
00:32:54 I don't think it's as cynical as it could be
00:32:56 people make lists like that
00:32:58 3x3 lists like that or whatever
00:33:00 it's not like they're setting out to deliberately deceive people
00:33:02 it's that
00:33:04 this is what they're defaulting to
00:33:06 out of an instinct
00:33:08 or out of a sort of sense they have
00:33:10 that this is what's appreciated
00:33:12 and everybody does it
00:33:14 I totally think
00:33:16 that I have a sense of
00:33:18 if something feels
00:33:20 good in such a conventional way
00:33:22 that can make me like a little bit more
00:33:24 than how much I enjoyed it
00:33:26 when watching it because it gives me so much more appreciation
00:33:28 for it afterwards
00:33:30 so I totally get it
00:33:32 it's satisfying to agree with people
00:33:34 and to like say
00:33:36 oh I love this show
00:33:38 and to have everyone nod in agreement
00:33:40 and go yes that is a good show
00:33:42 and so if you've got two shows that you like equally
00:33:44 one of which is going to be controversial
00:33:46 and get you like insulted and the other of which is
00:33:48 everyone's going to be like yep same
00:33:50 you know
00:33:52 actually inclined to pick that one
00:33:54 I agree and I think it's
00:33:56 I definitely find some deep satisfaction
00:33:58 with the few times I get to agree
00:34:00 with pop culture and that's like
00:34:02 that's why I actually
00:34:04 like when people call me a hipster and stuff
00:34:06 I always feel like it's
00:34:08 it's so
00:34:10 mischaracterizing who I am
00:34:12 because of the fact that I hate
00:34:14 I hate that my taste is hipster taste
00:34:16 like I wish everyone liked everything I like
00:34:18 I don't want to be the guy
00:34:20 who likes the things that nobody likes
00:34:22 see that's the thing
00:34:24 this whole plebe thing
00:34:26 simply comes out of a lack of understanding
00:34:28 what the fuck is going on
00:34:30 if you don't like something
00:34:32 just explain why and if you're right
00:34:34 people will agree with you
00:34:36 and that's what we all do in our fucking videos
00:34:38 I made a fucking 40 minute video
00:34:40 it took me six months of my life just to explain
00:34:42 why one show is a little bit
00:34:44 better than everyone already thinks it is
00:34:46 that was substance
00:34:48 going on there what this is what we see
00:34:50 from the fucking plebes is them just saying
00:34:52 nope you're wrong and I'm not going to explain why
00:34:54 you're just wrong
00:34:56 I'm not impressed by that
00:34:58 I'm not impressed by that argument come back to me
00:35:00 when you've got something intelligent to say
00:35:02 I was on my way to my point about
00:35:04 that other kind of pleabeness
00:35:06 that I was accusing anime every day of
00:35:08 the fact that he thinks
00:35:10 that he has made the point
00:35:12 about those shows
00:35:14 is like
00:35:16 in regards to being a writer
00:35:18 like that I think that
00:35:20 there's a standard that I think most people
00:35:22 is the standard of reviews
00:35:24 and it's
00:35:26 shit tier like if you're writing
00:35:28 reviews that could get published in a major magazine
00:35:30 those are the shittiest reviews
00:35:32 possible
00:35:34 unless you're that one guy who writes for EGM
00:35:36 about how everything is a dick
00:35:38 sucking cock
00:35:40 it's like Tom Cruise sucking my dick
00:35:42 yeah that's the one
00:35:44 I think there was a time
00:35:46 in history where
00:35:48 consumer reviews were really important
00:35:50 right?
00:35:52 because a new movie came out
00:35:54 and no one knew if it was good
00:35:56 unless they went and watched it
00:35:58 and so you would open up a magazine
00:36:00 and the magazine would give you a very short description
00:36:02 of weather
00:36:04 the thing people have to understand about
00:36:06 writing from this so called objective
00:36:08 perspective
00:36:10 the point of it was never to
00:36:12 film's quality it was to present it
00:36:14 in a way that the most people
00:36:16 would resonate with
00:36:18 most people will feel
00:36:20 that a movie is shittily paced
00:36:22 so if someone says in an article
00:36:24 the film is bad because the pacing
00:36:26 is bad they're saying that because
00:36:28 most people will feel that way
00:36:30 it doesn't mean the movie is actually
00:36:32 bad because there's probably someone out there
00:36:34 who doesn't care about the pacing and will love
00:36:36 that movie but like the general
00:36:38 a critic is someone who has to channel
00:36:40 what they believe to be the general consensus
00:36:42 and put it into words and that's what
00:36:44 a consumer review is and that's what
00:36:46 someone like Roger Ebert was so good at doing
00:36:48 you know but like
00:36:50 I think that that age is gone
00:36:52 consumer reviewers are completely
00:36:54 fucking unnecessary because we have rotten
00:36:56 tomatoes and all you have to do
00:36:58 is open it and look at the number
00:37:00 and go okay
00:37:02 now I know
00:37:04 which is an aggregate of a bunch
00:37:06 of those mainstream consumer reviews
00:37:08 but like if you're fucking on YouTube
00:37:10 doing like consumer reviews
00:37:12 of anime it's like we have anime news network
00:37:14 for that we have
00:37:16 regular publications we have magazines
00:37:18 we have you know you can look at the
00:37:20 score that is given on my anime list
00:37:22 or something like what is the point of this
00:37:24 make your channel the story of your taste
00:37:26 because if you're a good writer
00:37:28 and you're like authentic with yourself
00:37:30 you can make you more interesting
00:37:32 I'm not accusing anyone of not being authentic
00:37:34 I'm just saying like maybe play into that
00:37:36 more like again let's be
00:37:38 very clear we're not like judging
00:37:40 I don't think you were judging anyone
00:37:42 based on your tastes you were
00:37:44 making statements like a reverse
00:37:46 spectrum the worst thing that you could
00:37:48 accuse did you was saying that someone's
00:37:50 taste was boring
00:37:52 like a reverse spectrum a guy who I think
00:37:54 listens to these he added me on Mal
00:37:56 recently and I looked at this top 5
00:37:58 well his top 4 are Red Line
00:38:00 Madoka, Samurai Flamenco
00:38:02 and Ping Pong and I was like well I see
00:38:04 a connection he likes stuff that goes
00:38:06 all out insanity or something like
00:38:08 that that's kind of a cool taste for him
00:38:10 and you know everyone's taste is fair
00:38:12 it's just that not me this isn't me
00:38:14 because I don't spend all my time on
00:38:16 4chan but Digi has certain opinions
00:38:18 make him go oh I know
00:38:20 this kind of thing
00:38:22 DerpyDoo
00:38:24 Hi I'm interrupting the podcast
00:38:26 man I had
00:38:28 just gotten out of bed when I got
00:38:30 on to this podcast
00:38:32 I guess I'm really
00:38:34 slurry
00:38:36 when I first wake up and a lot less
00:38:38 articulate
00:38:40 also this was recorded
00:38:42 probably 3 weeks before
00:38:44 it was the point at which
00:38:46 it gets released
00:38:48 because
00:38:50 Nate said because
00:38:52 you came into it late
00:38:54 that for some reason means you have to
00:38:56 be the one to edit it
00:38:58 and I was like
00:39:00 well okay
00:39:02 when I'm done with everything else I have
00:39:04 to do
00:39:06 and so this is what happens
00:39:08 well I just I'm bored by
00:39:10 this idea of like making a
00:39:12 video or making a list that says
00:39:14 like here's what are the best
00:39:16 anime and I'm like I don't think
00:39:18 we need someone to tell us that
00:39:20 like it's obvious
00:39:22 in a way like I need you to explain to
00:39:24 me why people care about it like because
00:39:26 and those shows are fucking ancient
00:39:28 you know like more people need
00:39:30 to watch more and broader anime
00:39:32 and come to their own conclusions
00:39:34 right and that's the other thing
00:39:36 is that like I think that when we
00:39:38 like because like I understand
00:39:40 from his perspective he's thinking like
00:39:42 well here's all these masterpieces
00:39:44 and not enough people have seen them
00:39:46 so I need to promote them but I'm
00:39:48 over here like I know all these other
00:39:50 shows I consider masterpieces
00:39:52 that even less people are watching
00:39:54 and so like it would be so much
00:39:56 more interesting to me if someone came out and they were like
00:39:58 my top nine shows are like
00:40:00 Minabi Straight and fucking
00:40:02 I'm just gonna look around
00:40:04 my room at the
00:40:06 and fucking Simone
00:40:08 and yeah and
00:40:10 like if someone came out with a list
00:40:12 that had camphor on it like the
00:40:14 thing is if you were on that guy's deal
00:40:16 if you were on 4chan then someone's
00:40:18 gonna go camphor but
00:40:20 if that guy if I saw it
00:40:22 if I saw in top nine and like there was
00:40:24 like eight great shows and camphor
00:40:26 I immediately
00:40:28 I'm gonna text like I'd be like please write a review of
00:40:30 camphor please like
00:40:32 nothing could be more interesting to me
00:40:34 than that guy's review of
00:40:36 camphor you know and so like
00:40:38 if I see a list and it's like
00:40:40 nine shows that I've read a thousand
00:40:42 million popular reviews of
00:40:44 you know like at the end of
00:40:46 at the end of 2009
00:40:48 this guy
00:40:50 basically every anime blogger on the planet
00:40:52 made a top 50 anime of the
00:40:54 decade list just because
00:40:56 it was the end of the decade everyone wanted to do it
00:40:58 so this guy called aqua blue
00:41:00 aqua blue sweater who's like a statistician
00:41:02 took all of them
00:41:04 and compiled them into like
00:41:06 the list of what were the top
00:41:08 rated ones and it was like
00:41:10 Haibane Renme, Mushishi
00:41:12 Kaiba like all these you know
00:41:14 all the fru fru shows you expect to be up there
00:41:16 and it's like they'd all been
00:41:18 reviewed by everyone because
00:41:20 like everyone who made those top 50s
00:41:22 they had like you know their little blurb
00:41:24 about each show so that means
00:41:26 like there were more blurbs written about
00:41:28 fucking Mushishi than
00:41:30 any other show so when someone makes
00:41:32 a video that's like Mushishi's the best
00:41:34 show I'm like yeah I know
00:41:36 everyone knows we all know
00:41:38 right about something else
00:41:40 please here's something that confuses me
00:41:42 a little bit I think
00:41:44 a lot of people what they want out of
00:41:46 a review is that
00:41:48 it agrees with their opinion
00:41:50 and which makes it kind of
00:41:52 doesn't that make it inherently uninteresting
00:41:54 I don't
00:41:56 that's what I was saying to my
00:41:58 some commenters I didn't like I was like
00:42:00 guys listen a video is
00:42:02 like an editorial it's a think piece
00:42:04 it's not an opinion
00:42:06 agreement delivery service
00:42:08 you phrase it like that and you shut them up
00:42:10 it feels good to hear someone affirm
00:42:12 your opinion but I also think that it's
00:42:14 not interesting to hear your own opinion
00:42:16 Ben I totally agree
00:42:18 but that's why I am firmly of the stance
00:42:20 that I think happiness and good feelings are vastly
00:42:22 overrated
00:42:24 no I agree with that
00:42:26 think about this real quick kind of viewers
00:42:28 if everyone was happy all the time
00:42:30 what would get done nothing
00:42:32 I actually at this point
00:42:34 I've way gotten past
00:42:36 the point where I actually get really mad
00:42:38 when I read positive reviews
00:42:40 of stuff I like that don't explain anything
00:42:42 like the worst review to me
00:42:44 is when someone like
00:42:46 if I see a review of Kaon
00:42:48 and the review is like
00:42:50 oh this show is really cute and fun
00:42:52 and it's good
00:42:54 go watch it and I'm like what the fuck
00:42:56 how is that going to like
00:42:58 yeah no shit I already knew that
00:43:00 you know dude that's
00:43:02 very much the reason
00:43:04 when I was making my Gurren Login video
00:43:06 I watched everyone's review and they were so
00:43:08 shit they were so bad
00:43:10 it had to be corrected so
00:43:12 of the exact same opinion
00:43:14 that's actually like that was realizing
00:43:16 that like what you realized watching all those
00:43:18 was a huge part of what
00:43:20 affirmed me into like doing this
00:43:22 because of the fact that I had always
00:43:24 assumed that this would
00:43:26 already have been done by a million people
00:43:28 that like there was already
00:43:30 like with Ava you know
00:43:32 like you assume there must have been every Ava analysis
00:43:34 possible because it's been around for so long
00:43:36 and you know and I know there is a lot
00:43:38 like there actually is like a whole channel
00:43:40 of Ava analysis
00:43:42 and there's like the Ava Geeks forum
00:43:44 and all that stuff but like in spite
00:43:46 of all that I feel like
00:43:48 most of the stuff I've said about the show is stuff
00:43:50 I've never seen someone else say
00:43:52 and like I think
00:43:54 there's still so much room because I think up until
00:43:56 recently consumer reviews
00:43:58 were what people thought criticism
00:44:00 of art was and like
00:44:02 analysis was mostly like a
00:44:04 like a school
00:44:06 what's the word I'm looking for
00:44:08 for I don't know like a school project
00:44:10 sort of thing is that what you're saying?
00:44:12 No academic that's the word I'm looking for
00:44:14 like it's more of an academic thing
00:44:16 it's more of a university thing
00:44:18 and like I don't think the market's ever going to be
00:44:20 too crowded of like personal
00:44:22 like thoughtful pieces
00:44:24 related to your own life of any show
00:44:26 you know whereas it's
00:44:28 like I think if
00:44:30 you can
00:44:32 like if you wanted to write just a review of a show
00:44:34 like go to google
00:44:36 type like KonoSuba
00:44:38 review and you're going to if you get any results
00:44:40 don't write a review
00:44:42 like write an analysis write a
00:44:44 think piece write something original
00:44:46 that's fair like I don't need
00:44:48 there to be more than one review
00:44:50 of anything and this has gotten to this point
00:44:52 with all these fucking new movies coming out
00:44:54 where because every youtuber has decided
00:44:56 that they're going to review every new
00:44:58 fucking Marvel movie makes that money dude
00:45:00 right we get YMS putting out these quickies
00:45:02 that are
00:45:04 worthless like completely critically
00:45:06 worthless they tell you nothing about
00:45:08 the film they are usually like
00:45:10 him nitpicking two random elements
00:45:12 and then spending five minutes going well it was good
00:45:14 but it wasn't as good as it could have been
00:45:16 but it's pretty okay wasn't quite as good
00:45:18 as great but it wasn't quite as great as amazing
00:45:20 but it wasn't as good as not good but it was almost
00:45:22 like three levels of good over good five
00:45:24 and like like I watched all these
00:45:26 fucking reviews of Civil War and it was like
00:45:28 Movie Bob had probably
00:45:30 the best consumer review
00:45:32 possible for that movie and even
00:45:34 then all I could think the whole time was
00:45:36 who cares
00:45:38 like everyone's going to see the movie
00:45:40 anyone who gives the slightest
00:45:42 fuck about this movie is going
00:45:44 to watch this movie this will probably be one
00:45:46 of the highest grossing films of all time
00:45:48 why do we have
00:45:50 800 consumer reviews coming out for a movie
00:45:52 literally everyone will see
00:45:54 why are these people doing that
00:45:56 those were invented before the
00:45:58 information age guys we don't need those as
00:46:00 much anymore you know I was going to say
00:46:02 this before but like I was thinking before
00:46:04 about like how I got into
00:46:06 the video games I like and like there were
00:46:08 two ways like my friends would tell me
00:46:10 about them and then like Ben and like people I knew
00:46:12 and then I read Game Informer
00:46:14 or like I would like oh my god
00:46:16 I love Game Informer I used to love that
00:46:18 shit it was so useful but
00:46:20 like even more than that
00:46:22 I would just flip through it looking for reviews
00:46:24 with scores under five and
00:46:26 just read them like trash a game
00:46:28 because I wanted to hear what like shitty
00:46:30 things they would say about them but see
00:46:32 yeah it was super great it was super fine I love
00:46:34 that magazine but like I don't read it anymore
00:46:36 largely because I mean maybe
00:46:38 because I don't have time but like it doesn't serve
00:46:40 the same purpose it once did of like educating
00:46:42 people on what a game you can just fucking google it
00:46:44 and find a thousand pages about whatever
00:46:46 go on V and everyone's talking about it
00:46:48 it aggregated all of human information
00:46:50 go to wikipedia
00:46:52 so bringing up Movie Bob
00:46:54 reminds me of another another
00:46:56 layer on the pleb
00:46:58 seven layer dip
00:47:00 and that is the sour cream
00:47:02 another like root cause
00:47:04 of pleb-ness of chronic pleb-ness
00:47:06 do you not like sour cream didgy
00:47:08 I actually like
00:47:10 physically can't eat sour cream
00:47:12 oh fuck you sour cream
00:47:14 it's like I throw up
00:47:16 if I eat it like it's disgusting
00:47:18 well get over it bitch
00:47:20 I'm gonna sneak sour cream into your
00:47:22 I'm gonna puke on your nuts
00:47:24 if you do that
00:47:26 anyway um yeah
00:47:28 Movie Bob
00:47:30 I think people are invested
00:47:32 in liking things
00:47:34 just by nature of the fact that they watch them
00:47:36 in not nuts of or in the Avengers
00:47:38 in his really that good about Avengers
00:47:40 Movie Bob brings up that like
00:47:42 going into watch Avengers
00:47:44 people aren't just rooting for the Avengers
00:47:46 like rooting for the Avengers themselves to win
00:47:48 is the same as them rooting for
00:47:50 them to like the movie for the movie
00:47:52 for the movie itself to succeed
00:47:54 yeah that was weird that was his point
00:47:56 though I think Bob is someone who can just watch movies
00:47:58 whatever like he is
00:48:00 he is no pleb when it comes to movies in terms of watching them
00:48:02 it seems like he's watched all movies that exist
00:48:04 like his like I thought his point was good
00:48:06 about people like that go into the movie
00:48:08 are already invested like
00:48:10 financially and time wise
00:48:12 in their own enjoyment of the movie
00:48:14 they want to like it because they are there
00:48:16 watching it and I thought it was weird that he
00:48:18 made it out like Avengers was the only
00:48:20 movie that did this or that it was brilliant for doing it
00:48:22 I thought it was applicable to pretty much any
00:48:24 movie yeah just the fact
00:48:26 that I have watched something kind of
00:48:28 makes me want to give it the benefit of the doubt
00:48:30 so that I won't have wasted my time
00:48:32 that's entirely true but that brings up
00:48:34 perhaps the biggest core problem
00:48:36 with plebdom in general which is just
00:48:38 an an an interest in
00:48:40 liking it over being critical of it
00:48:42 and like viewing it from an intellectual lens
00:48:44 you know particularly something that you use to
00:48:46 like you don't really like as much anymore
00:48:48 but you want to keep hanging on to it
00:48:50 that keep going on these long tanges
00:48:52 don't give a fuck about
00:48:54 yeah I know it's true
00:48:56 Ben you're absolutely right about that
00:48:58 I mean yeah I mean that was the thing that I used
00:49:00 to I think I used to feel that more
00:49:02 strongly nowadays I
00:49:04 I find disliking something
00:49:06 to be just as interesting and satisfying
00:49:08 as liking something after the fact
00:49:10 and no longer bothered by the idea that I
00:49:12 didn't like something you've got to get to that place
00:49:14 from plebdom you got to rise I think that's
00:49:16 where I think that the same
00:49:18 exact emotion you're talking about
00:49:20 is why people do
00:49:22 these things like I did with sort
00:49:24 on online or asterisk war where like
00:49:26 I think that when you
00:49:28 watch something and you don't like it at all
00:49:30 you feel that you need to
00:49:32 squeeze something out of it like you
00:49:34 have to get like because you've been so
00:49:36 wrong like my brother
00:49:38 Victor he's
00:49:40 but like long before I was even doing
00:49:42 YouTube like a couple
00:49:44 years before and I kept wanting to do videos
00:49:46 out of this but he would every time he saw
00:49:48 a movie he hated he would go on these
00:49:50 epic rants about them like
00:49:52 he saw like
00:49:54 that sounds like me in my youth he saw
00:49:56 fucking what's it called
00:49:58 Clash of the Titans like the new one
00:50:00 and he just like went on this
00:50:02 fucking tirade there's like 22
00:50:04 minute amazing beautiful tirade
00:50:06 it was the best thing I'd ever seen
00:50:08 and I realized that it's just because
00:50:10 he felt so robbed by the movie
00:50:12 that he had to like you know
00:50:14 feel something so like
00:50:16 he had to express his rage
00:50:18 so that he could then feel
00:50:20 a response to the film
00:50:22 have to feel anything at all
00:50:24 it's better to feel something than nothing
00:50:26 by the way D'Vu want to extend the olive branch
00:50:28 I didn't mean to be so harsh there I was
00:50:30 just finishing a point
00:50:32 anything you care to comment on now D'Vu
00:50:34 I said that was the whole sentence
00:50:36 you like stopped me at the end of my point
00:50:38 well then well done Nate alright
00:50:40 let's go into another facet of plebdom
00:50:42 that um
00:50:44 this is sort of changing the subject
00:50:46 but I feel like we've gone like
00:50:48 for a while we were doing reviewer rules too
00:50:50 so uh
00:50:52 getting back into plebs
00:50:54 really every video is a reviewer rule
00:50:56 it kind of is we tend to go back into that
00:50:58 that's our perspective yeah
00:51:00 but here's one that drives me crazy
00:51:02 is just the closed mindedness
00:51:04 of plebs
00:51:06 and I think that
00:51:08 a big part of being a pleb
00:51:10 is not realizing
00:51:12 how much more is out there
00:51:14 and how many different ways there are
00:51:16 to enjoy things
00:51:18 and just like holding up
00:51:20 in your idea of yourself
00:51:22 and what you like
00:51:24 and it's most common with I think
00:51:26 basically everyone gets into most
00:51:28 things through action
00:51:30 like we all probably
00:51:32 grew up watching more action oriented shows
00:51:34 than the ones we watch now
00:51:36 yeah would you say
00:51:38 yeah I remember like in like Power Rangers
00:51:40 and stuff like that when I was young
00:51:42 and then getting into DBZ
00:51:44 like next gen when you were
00:51:46 8 you know
00:51:48 well I mean not
00:51:50 no I mean I really liked Winnie the Pooh
00:51:52 well beyond the age
00:51:54 well beyond the age that I was supposed to
00:51:56 like Winnie the Pooh
00:51:58 which is now right
00:52:00 I mean I haven't watched it in a long time
00:52:02 I was really big into Winnie the Pooh
00:52:04 and it was great and colorful and fun to watch
00:52:06 it's great so comforting it's the best
00:52:08 the point I'm making is sort of that I think
00:52:10 when you're young you like action
00:52:12 because it's immediate and it's not boring
00:52:14 and you get the point right off the bat
00:52:16 like everything is clear to you
00:52:18 and like that's why
00:52:20 shows for kids are all action or comedy
00:52:22 like it always is and there was even a
00:52:24 like a quote from
00:52:26 like I first realized that
00:52:28 when I was like 12
00:52:30 and they were showing like some behind the scenes footage
00:52:32 of the movie
00:52:34 and the guy was saying like
00:52:36 because this is an adult cartoon we don't have to
00:52:38 animate shit because like with kids
00:52:40 great he was like with kids
00:52:42 stuff has to be moving
00:52:44 constantly or else they won't pay attention
00:52:46 but with adults to watch anything
00:52:48 well yeah I mean it's kind of true
00:52:50 that's such a weird reversal of like the normal
00:52:52 the normal attitude that like
00:52:54 things for kids can be shit
00:52:56 the funny thing about it is that it's just
00:52:58 animation because what carries
00:53:00 awkward teen hunger force is entirely
00:53:02 the voice acting and dialogue
00:53:04 it's really well acted
00:53:06 it's this weird offbeat humor
00:53:08 but like most of the show
00:53:10 is completely not animated
00:53:12 like it's just lit movements
00:53:14 and like nothing actually
00:53:16 moves and so
00:53:18 like yeah but he was like
00:53:20 and the funny thing is that of course
00:53:22 plenty of kids did watch that show
00:53:24 because it's still a cartoon
00:53:26 and it still you know
00:53:28 is the imagination of kids who've never seen anything
00:53:30 like this before but like
00:53:32 I just think that for
00:53:34 I think that for a lot of people
00:53:36 they never quite graduate
00:53:38 out of the mindset of liking the same
00:53:40 thing that they liked when they were young
00:53:42 because like you eventually have
00:53:44 this identity of I'm a guy who likes
00:53:46 action shows and then
00:53:48 until something disproves that
00:53:50 it just keeps getting stronger over time
00:53:52 that you just never believe that you'll like
00:53:54 something else unless it's proven wrong
00:53:56 dude that totally reminds me
00:53:58 that just makes me think of an example in my life
00:54:00 that you guys can probably all relate to
00:54:02 like because I want to make a distinction
00:54:04 between and probably should have done this in the beginning
00:54:06 between like plebdom and intelligence
00:54:08 because they are not necessarily
00:54:10 correlated at all
00:54:12 despite what Urban Dictionary would have us believe
00:54:14 case in point is my own dad
00:54:16 because my dad is a super smart guy
00:54:18 smartest guy I know probably
00:54:20 and like
00:54:22 he likes to watch on TV
00:54:24 like the trashiest shit
00:54:26 that you could possibly he loves
00:54:28 big bang theory
00:54:30 we're in it I hope you're recording
00:54:32 Jesse I'm making a fucking point get back to me when you're recording
00:54:38 already 15 minutes into this Jesse
00:54:40 well Ben jumped in like for the last
00:54:42 five minutes or one once that was fine
00:54:44 what okay I was just saying
00:54:46 that my dad likes super trashy shows
00:54:48 that really he just watches
00:54:50 like to turn off his brain
00:54:52 like to relax he's not
00:54:54 he's not us he's not a guy who's like
00:54:56 looking to like make the best art possible
00:54:58 he's a guy who wakes up works for like
00:55:00 12 hours a day doing like this
00:55:02 this you know doing
00:55:04 his job and at the end of the day he's ready
00:55:06 to fucking chill he just wants to like relax
00:55:08 and that is super pleb
00:55:10 but like it's not a reflection on the kind of man
00:55:12 he is it's just that when it comes to this art
00:55:14 he doesn't give a fuck you know it's a reflection
00:55:16 on it's what he's
00:55:18 looking for out of it and you can be looking
00:55:20 this is why people think that did you bro
00:55:22 use him as another example
00:55:24 so really I'm defending
00:55:26 I'm your I'm your people's champion so you
00:55:28 know don't cry into me but like I
00:55:30 think maybe a lot of people you know
00:55:32 if they get some opinion in their heads
00:55:34 they go into every show or everything
00:55:36 that they do thinking whatever it is
00:55:38 I'm gonna make sure it reinforces my existing
00:55:40 opinions as much as possible and that
00:55:42 may be why a lot of people to use did you as another
00:55:44 example think that he hates a one
00:55:46 shows because they're a one shows
00:55:48 and we'll go out of his way no you go in
00:55:50 I mean what you've told me is you go into a one shows
00:55:52 hoping for it to be the one that proves you wrong
00:55:54 right that makes you finally like it
00:55:56 I'm sure the people who say that don't believe
00:55:58 when he says that but we know him and we know
00:56:00 that I mean I mean not everyone
00:56:02 not everyone wants to be critical
00:56:04 of their media not everyone not everyone
00:56:06 really values art
00:56:08 in a way that we do
00:56:10 not everyone
00:56:12 it's way more interesting
00:56:14 it's way more interesting to go into a thing
00:56:16 thinking how is this going to change
00:56:18 into an evolved my taste
00:56:20 is this gonna be the country album
00:56:22 that gets me into country
00:56:24 I don't like country
00:56:26 I've
00:56:28 not been paying attention for a very long time
00:56:30 I honestly forgot you were here
00:56:32 and I
00:56:34 I realize that it's just because
00:56:36 I don't care about
00:56:38 people being plebs they can do
00:56:40 whatever they like
00:56:42 well you don't care about anything
00:56:44 let me go back to
00:56:46 let me go back to what guy was saying
00:56:48 real quick
00:56:50 let's talk about my brilliant points
00:56:52 about people
00:56:54 they get an idea of what they like when they're young
00:56:56 and then it never changes
00:56:58 I think that part of that
00:57:00 no it was me it's all me
00:57:02 I think that's
00:57:04 I mean people just don't
00:57:06 I mean when you're a kid you have all the time in the world
00:57:08 to consume all the shows and whatever
00:57:10 in games and stuff in the world
00:57:12 you tend to not have
00:57:14 either the time nor patience
00:57:16 nor even the desire to like watch more stuff
00:57:18 so you don't yeah so that just
00:57:20 that just kind of
00:57:22 my point is just don't act like
00:57:24 you have legitimate opinions
00:57:26 I wanted to get into Nate because
00:57:28 you were talking about your dad being a pleb
00:57:30 and like my dad's plebness
00:57:32 fascinates me so much
00:57:34 because like
00:57:36 like your dad he's a smart guy
00:57:38 not as educated as yours but he does read a lot
00:57:40 loves philosophy and stuff like that
00:57:42 so it's pretty knowledgeable
00:57:44 cool cool yeah
00:57:46 like all he does when he's not at work
00:57:48 is watch TV he comes home he turns it on
00:57:50 he leaves it on
00:57:52 I mean he doesn't necessarily pay attention to all of it
00:57:54 he'll like check his fucking tablet and stuff
00:57:56 but yeah he will get
00:57:58 instantly invested in
00:58:00 anything it doesn't matter
00:58:02 if something's on TV and he watches it for more than
00:58:04 one minute he is immediately
00:58:06 invested and you cannot distract him or else
00:58:08 he'll get mad that's not pleb
00:58:10 that's patrician as fuck yeah it
00:58:12 does not matter what it is
00:58:14 it's interesting because on some level
00:58:16 it is super patrician because like he actually
00:58:18 that's like me when
00:58:20 that's like me when law and order special victims
00:58:22 unit comes on and even though I don't give a fuck
00:58:24 I can't not watch it
00:58:26 special victims unit is great at baiting the hook
00:58:28 it's funny because I'm the type who like
00:58:30 I walk in and like
00:58:32 I can even like get interested
00:58:34 and I'll leave anyways because I'm like I want to do
00:58:36 something else but like
00:58:38 my dad will he'll just watch everything
00:58:40 and like
00:58:42 any TV show that's like actually good
00:58:44 or any movie that's actually good he retains
00:58:46 all of it he can remember stuff about movies from
00:58:48 like decades ago even though his memory
00:58:50 is ordinarily complete shit
00:58:52 but the funny thing is that
00:58:54 he's explained it to me before that like
00:58:56 TV is just because he grew
00:58:58 up with it and he like understands it
00:59:00 then it's very easy for him
00:59:02 to like just watch all of it like
00:59:04 he was like you know when I was growing up
00:59:06 you just watched all the TV that's just what people
00:59:08 did you sat down with your family at the end
00:59:10 like he said you know my parents would
00:59:12 come home and we'd all sit in the living room
00:59:14 and we'd all watch TV together and that was just
00:59:16 what life was you know so like yeah
00:59:18 that's so ingrained in him and he's
00:59:20 always said that like he's a he's
00:59:22 legitimately like afraid to play
00:59:24 video games because if he thinks
00:59:26 that it would take so much more investment
00:59:28 that he would become super addicted and it
00:59:30 would consume his whole life like that's
00:59:32 why he doesn't want to play games but like
00:59:34 but when it comes to music
00:59:36 for whatever reason he can't
00:59:38 as he put it he doesn't hear
00:59:40 music like
00:59:42 it just kind of starts playing and he
00:59:44 immediately stops paying attention to it
00:59:46 and like the only songs he listens to
00:59:48 are like stuff with catchy hooks and like
00:59:50 anything that's good for working out
00:59:52 he downloads these fucking
00:59:54 these like running mixes of songs
00:59:56 where it'll be like it's basically like
00:59:58 Eurobeat but like with a dance like
01:00:00 a dance version of a song
01:00:02 they're fucking hilarious but he'll
01:00:04 have like all this like trashy music
01:00:06 running to initial D music is just the most
01:00:08 awesome thing you can do with your life
01:00:10 well it's not like that intense
01:00:12 but like
01:00:14 he listens to like all this like
01:00:16 you know incredibly
01:00:18 plebbed here shit he once was
01:00:20 my favorite quote from him ever was
01:00:22 that Billy
01:00:24 what's his name Billy Joe Armstrong
01:00:26 he said Billy Joe Armstrong is the
01:00:28 greatest songwriter of all time
01:00:30 the guy from Green Day
01:00:32 and I was just like it blew my mind
01:00:34 so hard that he legitimately
01:00:36 thought that and then like
01:00:38 and he is like I could
01:00:40 endless treasure trove that's about
01:00:42 who's to say that he isn't though
01:00:44 I mean he could be but his reasoning was
01:00:46 that he had sold the most records
01:00:48 obviously I'm actually the greatest
01:00:50 songwriter of all time but taking myself
01:00:52 out of the equation I can see how
01:00:54 the way I would describe what my dad's logic was
01:00:56 for why Billy Joe Armstrong is because
01:00:58 he's the most successful
01:01:00 musician who my dad is also a fan of
01:01:02 like yeah not that
01:01:04 that's not good I like that because my dad
01:01:06 really values
01:01:08 like success like he thinks that if you
01:01:10 are the best seller then that means you
01:01:12 are the best but at the same time
01:01:14 if he doesn't like it then he's not going to
01:01:16 acknowledge it as the best so it's like
01:01:18 he should say
01:01:20 Gangnam Style is the greatest musician of our
01:01:22 generation then well that is a fucking
01:01:24 song I would say but
01:01:26 I mean he is but okay his name is
01:01:28 Psy by the way
01:01:30 Gangnam Style
01:01:32 his name is definitely Gangnam Style
01:01:34 he makes K-pop
01:01:36 and doesn't have anything to do with it
01:01:38 let's be honest what other songs is he ever going to write
01:01:40 he's Gangnam Style until the day he dies
01:01:42 he made Gentleman was good oh I like to hang over
01:01:44 I don't believe you stop it stop making up these
01:01:46 fake songs he's not a real he's not even
01:01:48 that song was literally just Gangnam Style
01:01:50 I don't even believe that Psy
01:01:52 is a real person I think he's like computer
01:01:54 animated like gorillas or something
01:01:56 he's secretly created
01:01:58 by Kesha so that she could make music
01:02:00 while still being locked into contract that
01:02:02 rapist she created
01:02:04 you know what I want to talk about
01:02:06 a small defense of plebs
01:02:08 and I want to make this a distinction because
01:02:10 there's I think there's a very big difference
01:02:12 that is extremely overlooked
01:02:14 between having
01:02:16 like pleb taste as
01:02:18 in you only like
01:02:20 shit and you have no good reasons for it
01:02:22 and then I think there's
01:02:24 an underrated populace
01:02:26 of people who
01:02:28 don't know a lot of different shows
01:02:30 but actually do
01:02:32 really appreciate the few things that they're into
01:02:34 on a really deep level
01:02:36 and I think a great example is
01:02:38 Jesse's musical taste
01:02:40 because if Jesse wants
01:02:42 I was what are you what is this
01:02:44 what is this attack on my character
01:02:46 as soon as I joined the podcast
01:02:48 I'm defending you first of all
01:02:50 but you sent me
01:02:52 not just insane clown posse
01:02:54 but like I had a bunch of my friends
01:02:56 make top 100 album charts once
01:02:58 and Jesse sent me one that had
01:03:00 like entire discographies
01:03:02 of five different artists it was like
01:03:04 all the gorillas albums
01:03:06 that doesn't mean I don't know of other music
01:03:08 I'm not saying you don't but I'm saying that like
01:03:10 it just seems like you really
01:03:12 appreciate those few bands
01:03:14 rather than like
01:03:16 getting into like a fuck ton of different
01:03:18 yeah because they're objectively the best bands
01:03:20 yeah like Jesse would say that like
01:03:22 the song he was listening to when he
01:03:24 when he plowed puss for the first time
01:03:26 you know that's a 10 out of 10 song just by virtue of that alone right
01:03:28 you're being a personal connection stuff
01:03:30 right I just remember
01:03:32 thinking like I saw the list and I was like
01:03:34 if anybody else sent me a list
01:03:36 and their top 10 was
01:03:38 what your top 10 was
01:03:40 I would probably assume they were a
01:03:42 I think that song actually might have been the Rambo theme
01:03:44 now that I'm thinking back to it
01:03:46 but because I was watching
01:03:48 first blood baby first blood
01:03:50 I was watching first blood part 2 on Valentine's Day
01:03:52 and I think that's what it actually was
01:03:54 I know for a fact that there's nothing
01:03:56 that Jesse loves that he couldn't explain
01:03:58 to me in great detail
01:04:00 why it was there you know
01:04:02 like if I said
01:04:04 like if someone else told me like
01:04:06 even if it's something as simple as like
01:04:08 I listened to it like when me and my best
01:04:10 friends had this like amazing car ride
01:04:12 in tune with our spirits and like 5 in the morning
01:04:14 just driving across the state border
01:04:16 running from the police like that's a much
01:04:18 more interesting explanation than anything
01:04:20 fucking anime everyday is going to give you
01:04:22 hold on actually
01:04:24 this is totally off topic but I think
01:04:26 it's fascinating I can actually
01:04:28 get that vicariously from other
01:04:30 people's stories has that ever happened to you
01:04:32 like you read
01:04:34 what happened to someone else
01:04:36 that's a mark of a great storyteller who can convey that
01:04:38 you know that's kind of how I am with everything
01:04:40 and I think when you have a personal connection
01:04:42 to something that's the most patrician
01:04:44 fucking thing there is you can like anything
01:04:46 you can like a fucking doctor
01:04:48 oh my gosh I just realized a huge irony here
01:04:50 saved your wife as a child and that's a patrician
01:04:52 doctor the whole time you were talking about
01:04:54 this I was thinking about this one older
01:04:56 cousin of mine who's pleb in the most
01:04:58 annoying way where she's like uh this is
01:05:00 this and her name is patricia
01:05:02 and so she's all like
01:05:04 she's like uh this movie sucks
01:05:06 like she just like says it and then like
01:05:08 she doesn't say anything about it
01:05:10 she's all like uh anime was a mistake
01:05:12 she just makes you feel icky about it
01:05:14 I also know this other girl who I knew
01:05:16 who was all like
01:05:18 that's what I thought you were gonna say
01:05:20 just like the people who are like that
01:05:22 and I think they're all women
01:05:24 like the people who are like uh this is
01:05:26 I guess it's plain I personally in my own life
01:05:28 I've only known women who are like this alright
01:05:30 I too hate women
01:05:32 I think we all agree
01:05:34 that kind of plebishness
01:05:36 is my favorite kind of I have to talk to that
01:05:38 the kind of people who don't even go on forums
01:05:40 that's kind of what I was talking about
01:05:42 you don't even go on forums
01:05:44 I mean like people who go on forums
01:05:46 have some level of investment
01:05:48 yeah that's true
01:05:50 but to get back to what I was saying
01:05:52 about the personal connections thing
01:05:54 like yeah I agree with uh
01:05:56 with Jesse I think there's a lot to be said about
01:05:58 if it still evokes those
01:06:00 feelings like
01:06:02 because I've had stuff where I had a personal connection
01:06:04 and then now I don't care anymore
01:06:06 and like it's just like
01:06:08 but sometimes
01:06:10 this is my favorite example because there's a song
01:06:12 by the band at the drive in called
01:06:14 invalid litter department
01:06:16 and it's one of my favorite songs ever
01:06:18 and every time I hear it
01:06:20 I think about how I read on like some random
01:06:22 it was on like songmeanings.com
01:06:24 or something like someone just wrote this thing
01:06:26 about how they were driving
01:06:28 with their friend through like some bombed out city
01:06:30 or something like like just passing by
01:06:32 in the middle of the desert and like blasting the song
01:06:34 and they were like crying
01:06:36 and now every time I listen to the song
01:06:38 I imagine myself driving down a desert road
01:06:40 with a bombed out village
01:06:42 crying and now that's my
01:06:44 that's why I like the song now
01:06:46 no that's totally normal
01:06:48 it's not even my experience but yeah
01:06:50 I think that's yeah
01:06:52 humans are good at that
01:06:54 I think that's what keeps
01:06:56 like me knowing that that's happened to me
01:06:58 is why I love my job
01:07:00 I see it from an outsider perspective
01:07:02 but I get emails from people who are always telling me
01:07:04 how like you know I've changed the way that they saw
01:07:06 certain shows and stuff and like
01:07:08 there's been times where
01:07:10 like my opinion of something was fundamentally
01:07:12 changed by reading a review
01:07:14 like uh
01:07:16 like these two Agiloch albums called
01:07:18 The Mansell and Ashes Against the Grain
01:07:20 and like at first I liked the first one
01:07:22 and didn't like the second one and then I read
01:07:24 this review where this guy made this like
01:07:26 really strong case for why the other one
01:07:28 was the better one and then once I listened to it again
01:07:30 I completely understood
01:07:32 and now it's my favorite one you know
01:07:34 yeah or like you bring up
01:07:36 sometimes that like when we did our Kill La Kill
01:07:38 podcast long ago we were both
01:07:40 warm to lukewarm but then something changed
01:07:42 and you fell in love and I don't know what it is
01:07:44 but it didn't happen to me so
01:07:46 well he was 8 out of 10 right out the gate
01:07:48 like hey yeah you know what that's a good definition
01:07:50 of pleb anyone who thinks Kill La Kill
01:07:52 is not patrician is a pleb
01:07:54 that is definitely true I agree
01:07:56 well I agree I suppose
01:07:58 but I don't think it's not patrician
01:08:00 I just don't love it I don't know whatever
01:08:02 I don't want to get into a whole thing
01:08:04 I came into this podcast late so I don't know if we discuss this already
01:08:06 but we discuss how
01:08:08 how completely stupid
01:08:10 this topic is and how
01:08:12 the word pleb itself is a word that only
01:08:14 fucking idiots use and elitist swine
01:08:16 would ever even use the word
01:08:18 pleb in the first place
01:08:20 like when I think of the word pleb
01:08:22 when I think of the word pleb all I can picture
01:08:24 is that anime snob
01:08:26 yeah we win over that
01:08:28 but I want to make one of the anime snob
01:08:30 I know how I want this
01:08:32 I know these kinds of people
01:08:34 when I hear pleb I think of my cousin
01:08:36 even though her name is patricia
01:08:38 I think of her and think yeah
01:08:40 this is a real kind of people and if you have to
01:08:42 talk to them it's a real problem
01:08:44 jesse if you want to talk about the snob
01:08:46 you have to do the voice
01:08:48 oh god
01:08:50 I want to suck so many dicks
01:08:52 I want to suck didgy bros dick
01:08:54 that's why I poke him in the back
01:08:56 like a little girl in third grade
01:08:58 I throw gum in his hair because I want to suck his dick
01:09:00 guys hold on I actually legit
01:09:02 I logged into skype earlier
01:09:04 and I had a message from him and it said
01:09:06 if I paid for the trip
01:09:08 would you come to the con in
01:09:10 Detroit
01:09:12 that's all it said and I was
01:09:14 so confused
01:09:16 that little fucking fuck boy
01:09:18 he's so desperate for your attention
01:09:20 no idea what Connie's talking about
01:09:22 or why
01:09:24 I don't know man but I
01:09:26 actually you know I wouldn't take anything from him
01:09:28 speaking of messages
01:09:30 why is he in Detroit
01:09:32 hippo
01:09:34 tell us about that dude
01:09:36 that musician
01:09:38 oh shit
01:09:40 he just said another message
01:09:42 after like a year
01:09:44 oh that's a great story
01:09:46 wait did you say he was in Detroit
01:09:48 he's playing Dark Souls
01:09:50 damn it okay I'm dead
01:09:52 didgy wait
01:09:54 now I can talk about it
01:09:56 didgy wait
01:09:58 I heard Detroit did you say Detroit in there
01:10:00 yes a snob is apparently
01:10:02 going to Detroit for an anime convention
01:10:04 was the only part of America that's similar to this
01:10:06 I was there yesterday
01:10:08 no no gay we'll come back
01:10:10 yeah cause
01:10:12 alright cause this was a guy
01:10:14 who wanted you to do some work
01:10:16 for him and because you didn't like his work
01:10:18 he accused you of being a pleb
01:10:20 for not appreciating it
01:10:22 oh yeah tell this shit
01:10:24 okay well um
01:10:26 last year when I was
01:10:28 just out of the pony
01:10:30 sort of stuff I stopped making videos
01:10:32 and he approached me
01:10:34 on deviantart and said
01:10:36 I saw you as a brony analyst
01:10:38 and I thought you could do an animation
01:10:40 for my music and he sent me his music
01:10:42 and it was absolutely terrible
01:10:44 and
01:10:46 like hilariously terrible even for
01:10:48 like a pony can we link that
01:10:50 just to bully that person and have everybody
01:10:52 thumb it down link in the description
01:10:54 yeah go ahead
01:10:56 he eventually got an animator to do
01:10:58 something for it so whatever
01:11:00 but I told him that it was terrible
01:11:02 and I didn't like it and I just
01:11:04 you know cause I was angry
01:11:06 the whole pony
01:11:08 stuff I didn't want to be associated with it
01:11:10 I told him to fuck off and he responded
01:11:12 immediately with a really long rant
01:11:14 about how I was a piece of shit
01:11:16 and how he had been a guitarist
01:11:18 for 20 years
01:11:20 and he knew what he was talking about
01:11:22 and then he accused me of
01:11:24 like lots of strange things
01:11:26 that like you couldn't
01:11:28 infer from what I said but he
01:11:30 you could tell he just had problems with people
01:11:32 who felt these certain ways about certain things
01:11:34 and then like
01:11:36 then like three months later
01:11:38 he responded to my same message again
01:11:40 as if he had forgotten
01:11:42 that he saw it before
01:11:44 yeah he just did it again
01:11:46 I guess he just went on deviantart and saw it again
01:11:48 and got angry again
01:11:50 and then a few days ago
01:11:52 it happened again
01:11:54 they're all completely different
01:11:56 very long
01:11:58 angry comments against me
01:12:00 and it was really hilarious
01:12:02 maybe he thinks you didn't read the first one
01:12:04 and he's trying to get you to respond
01:12:06 but why would it be like
01:12:08 the first one was a year ago
01:12:10 I think all this time
01:12:12 he's been waiting for you to respond
01:12:14 defeated and like apologetic
01:12:16 and he hasn't gotten his apology yet
01:12:18 so he keeps reiterating
01:12:20 the argument because he thinks you just haven't read it yet
01:12:22 I think that's what was going on here
01:12:24 I do want him to post again
01:12:26 so I'm gonna wait and see if he does that
01:12:28 I think that the attribution
01:12:30 of pleb-ness in this scenario
01:12:32 is really interesting if you pick it apart
01:12:34 cause like he's a pleb
01:12:36 he's someone who sucks
01:12:38 and he doesn't get that he sucks
01:12:40 but he's done it for a long time
01:12:42 which he thinks means he's better
01:12:44 but actually means he's worse
01:12:46 because he's been a guitarist for so long
01:12:48 and he doesn't know what's good
01:12:50 he has no ear for it
01:12:52 he made this song but he thinks it's good
01:12:54 and it's not bad
01:12:56 I listened to it by the way back when he first posted
01:12:58 but because you think
01:13:00 that it's bad
01:13:02 because he
01:13:04 has done it for a long time
01:13:06 thinks he must be good
01:13:08 it must be you that's the pleb
01:13:10 because you don't appreciate how good this thing
01:13:12 must necessarily be
01:13:14 due to how good he must necessarily be
01:13:16 not only that
01:13:18 but in some of his things
01:13:20 he accused me of being
01:13:22 he assumed that I wasn't a musician
01:13:24 because I didn't like his music
01:13:26 why don't you put down the guitar hero
01:13:28 controller and let the real guitar hero
01:13:30 you just brought me to what I think
01:13:32 is now in my opinion
01:13:34 the truest definition of pleb
01:13:36 and the fucking hilarious irony
01:13:38 is that that anime snob is the perfect example
01:13:42 I don't find that surprising at all
01:13:44 well it's only surprising
01:13:46 because that anime snob has seen
01:13:48 way more anime than anybody else ever
01:13:50 he's seen
01:13:52 an unbelievable amount
01:13:54 so you'd think he would have figured some shit out by now
01:13:56 but I think if I had to put
01:13:58 a word to plebness
01:14:00 and lack of intellectual curiosity
01:14:02 just believing that
01:14:04 you have reached the end
01:14:06 and that there's not further to go
01:14:08 and that is as opposed to
01:14:10 normies who just don't involve themselves
01:14:12 in any of this shit
01:14:14 I mean if you've seen
01:14:16 all the anime
01:14:18 and you still can't appreciate the good stuff
01:14:20 that's way sadder than
01:14:22 if you've seen every anime
01:14:24 and you don't understand why someone might like
01:14:26 kaon
01:14:28 it's that
01:14:30 at some point in his life
01:14:32 that anime snob reached the conclusion
01:14:34 that he understood what is good
01:14:36 and what is bad
01:14:38 and he's just applied that exact formula
01:14:40 to absolutely everything
01:14:42 and I think that is exactly
01:14:44 what
01:14:46 I don't want to accuse anime every day
01:14:48 of that but that's the impression I've gotten
01:14:50 from him and that's why that taste bothers me
01:14:52 because I think that's how you end up
01:14:54 with that taste is by being
01:14:56 that way
01:14:58 I think a true pleb is just
01:15:00 anyone who refuses to
01:15:02 see what someone else might see
01:15:04 in something
01:15:06 I totally see what you mean that you consume so much media
01:15:08 you don't get it, reminds me of a great quote
01:15:10 I know people who read
01:15:12 enormously, book for book, letter for letter
01:15:14 yet whom I would not describe
01:15:16 as well read
01:15:18 they possess a massive knowledge but their brain is unable
01:15:20 to organize and register
01:15:22 the material they have taken in
01:15:24 Adolf Hitler
01:15:26 who said that?
01:15:28 Adolf Hitler
01:15:30 TWIST
01:15:32 FIGURE TWIST
01:15:34 it's amazing
01:15:36 wealth of Hitler quotes
01:15:38 no it's just that one
01:15:40 it's just that one
01:15:42 wait is that why I heard this before
01:15:44 because you did that one to me before
01:15:46 we're all sitting here nodding
01:15:48 agreement like man whoever said this
01:15:50 really knew a thing or two
01:15:52 oh my god
01:15:54 I'm blown away
01:15:56 we've reached critical mean guys
01:15:58 bam
01:16:00 he pulled that one out before
01:16:02 I guess we're Nazis now
01:16:04 this is the Nazi past now
01:16:06 the funny thing is I actually for a second thought it might be Maddox
01:16:08 because the way you read it was so different
01:16:10 oh man
01:16:12 well okay let's be real
01:16:14 I mean are we just gonna
01:16:16 disavow anything Hitler says just because he's
01:16:18 Hitler
01:16:20 well he was a vegan
01:16:22 if Hitler says the sky is blue
01:16:24 are we all gonna say it's green now
01:16:26 isn't this also a quote
01:16:28 no
01:16:30 that's the quote from me
01:16:32 if Hitler does X is it bad
01:16:34 no no no that exact phrase
01:16:36 if Hitler says the sky is blue are we all gonna
01:16:38 maybe Jesse said it in a different podcast
01:16:40 I've heard that exact phrase
01:16:42 yeah Hitler wasn't wrong about everything
01:16:44 we can all admit that
01:16:46 Hitler might have made
01:16:48 a lot of bad things
01:16:50 but he definitely wasn't a pleb
01:16:52 he was not
01:16:54 he might have made one small guffaw
01:16:56 once in his career
01:16:58 he might have been a pleb about painting
01:17:00 though maybe that's why he didn't make it
01:17:02 yeah that was definitely the case
01:17:04 he was so pleb with that it
01:17:06 created a deep frustration with him
01:17:08 about the world
01:17:10 plebness caused 9-11
01:17:12 that's what he did right
01:17:14 can I tell you guys about
01:17:16 you know I have a
01:17:18 do you guys have this as well
01:17:20 where you feel like
01:17:22 if you don't know enough about a subject
01:17:24 do you feel like inclined
01:17:26 to not talk about it
01:17:28 absolutely absolutely
01:17:30 absolutely not let me tell you people about homestuck
01:17:32 let me tell you about
01:17:34 the worst thing ever created
01:17:36 in the history of it
01:17:38 Jesse I would love to see you make a homestuck
01:17:40 review with exactly as much power
01:17:42 exactly
01:17:44 you know what guys
01:17:46 it's funny because we were arguing about homestuck
01:17:48 the other day for like 6 hours
01:17:50 it was horrible you guys are bad people
01:17:52 I went to motorcity
01:17:54 comicon yesterday
01:17:56 as soon as I walk in the building
01:17:58 was the first thing I see
01:18:00 two fat troll cosplayers
01:18:02 and I just instantly thought of you guys
01:18:04 and how much I hate ya
01:18:06 and how much I hate homestuck
01:18:08 it was you, it was digi and ben
01:18:10 dressed up as homestuckers
01:18:12 I found it in my convention
01:18:14 see the sad thing Jesse is that
01:18:16 it was the only one they ever dressed up as
01:18:18 the grey guy with the horns
01:18:20 that's all you ever fucking see
01:18:22 oh my god
01:18:24 I'm so fucking mad
01:18:26 anyways
01:18:28 what's his name
01:18:30 what's his name
01:18:32 vagina or vaginal or something
01:18:34 there's 12
01:18:36 actually yeah there's 24 of them now
01:18:38 actually technically there's 26 with the
01:18:40 24 identical character designs
01:18:42 wow what a great property
01:18:44 what a great work of art
01:18:48 so the point I was trying to make
01:18:50 before Jesse completely derailed it with homestuck
01:18:52 is that like
01:18:54 the biggest reason I do so many anime
01:18:56 videos is that I just don't feel
01:18:58 comfortable that I'm like
01:19:00 like I have an authoritative voice on anything
01:19:02 else like I know
01:19:04 I know enough about anime to talk about it
01:19:06 and not that I know more than everybody
01:19:08 but like that I
01:19:10 feel that the shit I say is not bullshit
01:19:12 and it comes from a place of knowing
01:19:14 what I'm talking about and like being able to
01:19:16 comment on it and then like
01:19:18 when it comes to stuff like films
01:19:20 and comics and stuff like that that I don't
01:19:22 like even though I do know a lot
01:19:24 about them there's just this feeling of
01:19:26 I haven't seen
01:19:28 enough you know like I haven't seen enough of the
01:19:30 classics I don't know enough of the like the
01:19:32 real shit and I've seen these
01:19:34 it's like if you're gonna go into writing an analysis
01:19:36 post about it you're gonna have to constantly
01:19:38 double track to make sure
01:19:40 you don't get something wrong
01:19:42 not much about factual inaccuracies but like I've
01:19:44 noticed this and this is something that bothers me
01:19:46 about plebs and it's not
01:19:48 even that they're doing a bad job
01:19:50 it's the lack of perspective
01:19:52 where someone will sometimes I'll see
01:19:54 this happens a lot with like newbie anime
01:19:56 reviewers the perfect example would be
01:19:58 Madoka Magica where like
01:20:00 like my review that I wrote of it was
01:20:02 largely in response to the
01:20:04 the pleb-ness of so many reviews of
01:20:06 Madoka because
01:20:08 that show had a
01:20:10 really broad appeal like a ton of people watched it
01:20:12 like it was a lot of people one of their first
01:20:14 anime like it was
01:20:16 the biggest show of 2011
01:20:18 and there were so many
01:20:20 people who wrote about it as this
01:20:22 deconstruction of magical girl
01:20:24 shows or as this
01:20:26 they kept saying like oh it's like this dark
01:20:28 take on magical girls and I'm like
01:20:30 the fact is none of you
01:20:32 have seen any magical girl shows
01:20:34 and I know that like I know
01:20:36 that because like the next
01:20:38 most popular one card captor
01:20:40 Sakura is also dark
01:20:42 like it also has
01:20:44 death and themes of
01:20:46 like a like a
01:20:48 you know just like darker themes like more adult stuff
01:20:50 that you wouldn't expect because like Madoka
01:20:52 like the way Madoka is written
01:20:54 it's sort of as though like hey magical girls
01:20:56 let's be a magical girl it'd be really easy
01:20:58 it'll be really fun oh turns out there's a lot of death so
01:21:00 it makes people go oh so it must be representing
01:21:02 the entire genre
01:21:04 that it comes from right yeah that's the thing
01:21:06 like and it was funny because it was one time
01:21:08 I tried to I wrote a post
01:21:10 called like how Madoka Magica could be
01:21:12 a deconstruction of magical girls and the only
01:21:14 conclusion I could come to was the
01:21:16 fact that she never transforms
01:21:18 until the very end of the show
01:21:20 like you know it's not until the very end that she makes her one
01:21:22 big transformation and that's the only major
01:21:24 one but then I thought about it and
01:21:26 technically in card captor Sakura she never
01:21:28 transforms she just puts on costumes
01:21:30 that Tomoyo gives her so that was already
01:21:32 like deconstructing the trope
01:21:34 of the magical girl transformation because
01:21:36 clamp the artists they didn't
01:21:38 want to just have her transform into one outfit
01:21:40 they wanted her to wear different cute outfits
01:21:42 every time so there was no transformation
01:21:44 she just literally put on clothes
01:21:46 that her friends was making for her so it
01:21:48 seems like this happens with a lot of different genres with the anime
01:21:50 like I saw a clip of like an old Gundam
01:21:52 thing it was like you have to get in the robot
01:21:54 man he's like I don't want to I'm scared
01:21:56 the plot of the original Gundam
01:21:58 like it was like this is from the
01:22:00 80s like 15 years before even Galleon
01:22:02 and you're already scared what's going on
01:22:04 here I don't know man I'm just scared
01:22:06 everyone would be scared to get in the robot not just Shinji
01:22:08 Ikari come on man you pleb it's not
01:22:10 it's not wrong to say that like
01:22:12 Eva you know did new things with it because
01:22:14 obviously that's true but it is wrong to say it's
01:22:16 never been done before which is just showing
01:22:18 that you don't know fucking jack shit
01:22:20 there's really nothing always that Eva did
01:22:22 that had never been done before it was
01:22:24 a conglomeration of a bunch of good ideas
01:22:26 into one super good idea
01:22:28 you know
01:22:30 when it comes to reviews I'm always
01:22:32 really scared of being
01:22:34 caught out as
01:22:36 not knowing my shit
01:22:38 it's not
01:22:40 so much that people will turn and laugh at me
01:22:42 like you fucked up it's like
01:22:44 from that point on people will take me less seriously
01:22:46 because I was incorrect
01:22:48 well like if I want to do like a video about
01:22:50 movies I specifically writing
01:22:52 a way to where I'm not like putting on airs
01:22:54 of knowing what I'm talking about that much in regards
01:22:56 to video games I know enough
01:22:58 to where if someone who knows more than me
01:23:00 is going to correct me I don't feel embarrassed because
01:23:02 those people are like legit next level
01:23:04 like hardcore gaming 101 fanatics
01:23:06 I'll say though like
01:23:08 to give two examples of two similar
01:23:10 YouTubers who one
01:23:12 of whom comes off
01:23:14 as a pleb sometimes in a way that bothers me and the other
01:23:16 magically doesn't
01:23:18 PBS idea channel
01:23:20 that guy I know he has
01:23:22 an incredible breadth of knowledge I know
01:23:24 he always tries to get into every new
01:23:26 nerd thing and like if it comes to music
01:23:28 he knows everything he knows everything
01:23:30 there is to know about music he's into the most obscure
01:23:32 shit he's into the craziest stuff
01:23:34 I know he knows film pretty well but
01:23:36 he does this thing because
01:23:38 on idea channel he always tries to like
01:23:40 jump into every like big name
01:23:42 topic and sometimes
01:23:44 you can just tell he doesn't
01:23:46 know shit about that medium because
01:23:48 like it'll be something like
01:23:50 Madoka where something comes along that everyone
01:23:52 makes a big deal out of and he talks about
01:23:54 it in the way that everyone else is
01:23:56 without having the context that it's actually
01:23:58 not that impressive or different it pisses me
01:24:00 off that he like thinks it's valuable to like
01:24:02 restate what everyone's already stated while
01:24:04 adding nothing to the conversation those videos he makes
01:24:06 piss me off let me guess you're going to compare him
01:24:08 to nerd writer right because
01:24:10 with nerd writer he has
01:24:12 like this amazing ability that
01:24:14 I cannot like I don't
01:24:16 know how much like for instance
01:24:18 with comics he made this video about the
01:24:20 Sandman comics and like
01:24:22 it was so mind blowing to me
01:24:24 that after this guy had made all these
01:24:26 film analysis all these song analysis
01:24:28 all this other shit and then he brings
01:24:30 comics into the fold and not just like
01:24:32 a like one everyone knows it was
01:24:34 fucking Sandman and I was like does he
01:24:36 know a lot about comics
01:24:38 can he possibly know pretty well
01:24:40 much about so many different
01:24:42 mediums you know like he's fucking
01:24:44 he just does
01:24:46 he does analysis of such a broad variety
01:24:48 of subjects and he always gives this impression
01:24:50 like he's known about it forever like he's been a fan of
01:24:52 it since he was in high school you know like
01:24:54 I do I feel like
01:24:56 maybe it has to do with his writing style like
01:24:58 he's able to write it in a way to where it comes off
01:25:00 correctly whereas I did channel I remember
01:25:02 in his kill la kill video he was talking about
01:25:04 like the names of certain things
01:25:06 and kill la kill and he was saying you know it could
01:25:08 have been named that because maybe
01:25:10 they had their like play on words with
01:25:12 their words in the Japanese language and he
01:25:14 listed all these things and I'm like I made a comment
01:25:16 like dude yeah that you obviously only
01:25:18 know that by looking at it on Wikipedia
01:25:20 yet you wrote it as though you came
01:25:22 to that conclusion on your own
01:25:24 that was very strange and I remember
01:25:26 that's a good example because what made
01:25:28 that so plebby to me is that
01:25:30 that's every fucking anime
01:25:32 everyone's named after puns like that's
01:25:34 just yeah that's like one of the most
01:25:36 like Japanese humor is like
01:25:38 all puns they love
01:25:40 word play they love kanji
01:25:42 you were born to the wrong civilization
01:25:44 like because so much of
01:25:46 how so much of how they
01:25:48 title stuff is always that like it's
01:25:50 a play on the way the characters are read
01:25:52 because almost every character can be read
01:25:54 multiple ways so they have all these
01:25:56 fucking word play gags that never
01:25:58 are fucking translatable well yeah for me
01:26:00 it was just weird because he was saying it as though
01:26:02 he came to that conclusion but there's
01:26:04 no way he didn't just read that on Wikipedia
01:26:06 but he read I was like
01:26:08 I've never seen that before
01:26:10 in any video yeah I got you
01:26:12 I got you I have seen that
01:26:14 videos it's called body video
01:26:16 where everything he says is
01:26:18 recollected information from forums
01:26:20 true but uh
01:26:22 but yeah well he does a
01:26:24 nice strip presenting yeah I don't mind
01:26:26 I like his channel but
01:26:28 yeah he's been very
01:26:30 widely accused of plagiarism
01:26:32 you know what's cool is that all this time we're talking about
01:26:34 plugs we're talking about patricians and I'm
01:26:36 watching a super mario 64
01:26:38 speedrun the most patrician thing
01:26:40 depending on how far you want to get into it
01:26:42 I am watching a speedrun of an entire
01:26:44 alternate level map of entirely different
01:26:46 levels at someone's speedrunning super mar 64
01:26:48 super patrician go watch panic
01:26:50 koic 2012 patrician
01:26:52 actually you got me yeah man
01:26:54 brings me to another thing about like what I was just
01:26:56 describing though is like I don't know
01:26:58 about you guys but I feel like I will
01:27:00 never in my entire life
01:27:02 will I be the guy who knows the most about
01:27:04 anything like yeah no
01:27:06 subject on which I mean out of like the
01:27:08 seven billion people it's exceedingly
01:27:10 unlikely that you will be just because
01:27:12 I don't even think panic koic is the most
01:27:14 knowledgeable about sm64 is just he's the
01:27:16 only one with that level of knowledge who makes
01:27:18 videos right like I think there's always
01:27:20 going to be and I'm always jealous
01:27:22 of those people because like as much as
01:27:24 I love chaos and could talk about it all
01:27:26 day like I don't know I couldn't tell
01:27:28 you the episode names even you know
01:27:30 like and even with when I was into my little
01:27:32 pony and I could do that like I didn't watch
01:27:34 them over and over again I couldn't tell you
01:27:36 as somebody out there does somebody does
01:27:38 there's definitely someone I recite every
01:27:40 episode of the show to you I think
01:27:42 there was a period where a couple years
01:27:44 ago where I was probably in the top
01:27:46 500 globally of South Park
01:27:48 knowledge and like everything about it
01:27:50 like I could tell you things but that's I
01:27:52 haven't updated my knowledge you know like
01:27:54 I watched the South Park movie
01:27:56 it was with a like my brother's friend
01:27:58 and he had his older brother who was
01:28:00 like 16 or 17 at the time
01:28:02 and he was literally
01:28:04 word for word reciting
01:28:06 the movie as we were watching it
01:28:08 because he had seen it so many times
01:28:10 he had memorized it. Now see that's
01:28:12 that's fine you can do that if you want
01:28:14 I just I don't really feel the need to get into that
01:28:16 because I know I don't either I feel this
01:28:18 yeah but I just I'm much interested
01:28:20 when I watch a show I'm interested
01:28:22 in like what I can
01:28:24 get out of it intellectually you know
01:28:26 well yeah I think there's something more than just
01:28:28 wrote memorization like I feel like I may
01:28:30 have been one of the top people in terms of
01:28:32 like being able to understand
01:28:34 South Park in certain ways like
01:28:36 like after watching like every
01:28:38 interview I was able to figure out
01:28:40 exactly why their production cycle
01:28:42 is so hectic it's because they
01:28:44 back in the day they could never get around to writing an episode until they had no time left they just kept
01:28:48 procrastinating there's not a single interview
01:28:50 that says this but I watched all of them until
01:28:52 I was able to piece it together that's why by the way
01:28:54 that's why it's done like that it's just back in
01:28:56 the day they could never stop
01:28:58 procrastinating until they had no time left
01:29:00 and so they would just come up with whatever was in the news
01:29:02 and write that that was that's why they made
01:29:04 it like that and they just stuck with it because it was a
01:29:06 successful model but no one knows that but
01:29:08 me and now everyone listening to this podcast
01:29:10 well I think my envy
01:29:12 of those people is just that I think
01:29:14 to me you can never
01:29:16 analyze something too much because at some
01:29:18 point you get to where like the timbre
01:29:20 timbre timbre of someone's
01:29:22 voice top timbre like the timbre
01:29:24 like the timbre of their the way
01:29:26 that they their inflection when they say that
01:29:28 one line of dialogue and like why it
01:29:30 makes you feel something that they said it that way
01:29:32 like you know that could be
01:29:34 interesting thing or like why I just
01:29:36 watched this color being used in this
01:29:38 scene is like why it makes you feel something
01:29:40 and uh you know and
01:29:42 well we can ignore the color of the curtains
01:29:44 in the background make shit up right
01:29:46 again watch panicoic he just came out
01:29:48 with a video about Monty Mole spawning
01:29:50 oh my god did he do another commentated
01:29:52 no he has this other channel called
01:29:54 pan and kiyok because he doesn't
01:29:56 want to do narration that much it takes
01:29:58 too long so don't ask him or else
01:30:00 shout out to the least plead man in the
01:30:02 world pan and kiyok that guy
01:30:04 yeah I just I would
01:30:06 I'll kill everyone for another
01:30:08 fucking uh a rolling rocks 0.5
01:30:10 yeah I asked him about that I asked
01:30:12 him on the comment he made me feel like an idiot
01:30:14 because he was like you know people ask me about this
01:30:16 constantly that's why I have this alt channel
01:30:18 where I put out quick videos if people start
01:30:20 making me for commentations on my quick
01:30:22 videos I'm gonna have to make a secret channel
01:30:24 what does he feel fucking threatened by people
01:30:26 wanting more content man fuck this guy
01:30:28 take it back he's a pleb I fucking hate him
01:30:30 but anyway like if you guys don't know who we're
01:30:32 talking about he's the guy who said but first
01:30:34 we gotta talk about multiple universes
01:30:36 he's my favorite meme that guy
01:30:38 parallel universes yeah that guy
01:30:40 and uh what is it uh TJ Henry
01:30:42 Ryoshi yeah
01:30:44 best yeah that was the best like now there's
01:30:46 a fucking pleb
01:30:48 you can't say it's only a half
01:30:50 you can't say it's
01:30:52 half a press it's just an a press
01:30:54 you don't fucking get it
01:30:56 well hear me out
