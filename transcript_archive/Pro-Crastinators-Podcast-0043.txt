00:00:00 This one goes out to my mortal deity, Sans the Skeleton, my favorite ghetto spiritualist and sewer priest, Endless Jess, and my dad. Please forgive me, sensei.
00:00:12 Just sitting here on my bed, cleaning out my botflies, and making them dead. It doesn't matter though, they'll be back on the attack in like three fucking seconds.
00:00:21 Cause I have botflies over my house, and in my bed, and in my head, and in my brain, and my pants are fiddle with them. I really like Ulysses as Grant.
00:00:30 Killed the blacks and the gays, not cause they're bad, and they're okay. I just want to make everyone skeletons like my god Sans. That's my mission, you see.
00:00:39 Haha, alright, bitch. Gonna spread over to my Mexicans house, friend's house, and stuff burritos down my lemon pipe. Real spicy too. Gonna torture my dick daily and nightly. Whoops, oh fuck.
00:00:49 Disneyland police guard people are here, and they found my bathroom rap studio. Oh god, when I get nervous, I shit them on soon. Relicosa tattoo is my favorite video game.
00:00:57 I have a tattoo of Sans the Skeleton on my actual literal butthole. Like, directly on it, bruh.
00:01:02 She's like, oh fuck, they're trying to forcibly rape me, am I rape me? I mean, I mean, we're dude, they're sorry, man.

00:01:30 And Digi bro, I'm still gay and still dead and then saint I'm these farce from the mic and
00:01:40 Today we have a
00:01:42 Unbelievable honour to have this special guest with us
00:01:45 Florian Hymsel co-creator of binding of Isaac what's up, dude, oh hey guys. Oh man. What a surprise
00:01:54 you must be a big what are you doing here how did you get here on to our
00:01:58 channel oh no I was the last in introduction oh no that's cuz you're
00:02:04 the most important of course so so we noticed recently that you commented on
00:02:09 the binding of Isaac video from rad con two that was put up and you were just
00:02:13 like hey guys check out my game looking pretty good on this channel and then we
00:02:17 just started talking and now you're here and it's a it's fucking rad dude it's
00:02:21 great yeah um if I may I just like to ask sir Hemsel how how how did you find
00:02:29 the PCP how did you get them how did how did this come to pass I've been
00:02:35 watching for a while it's quite my favorite podcast actually
00:02:38 oh why that was my first question too well he doesn't have to answer that if
00:02:50 he doesn't want to actually yes it's which one of us did you find first and
00:03:00 that's probably did you bro actually cuz I watch the sword art sucks and then I
00:03:07 watched some more but then I forgot about did she and then later I discovered
00:03:11 chess and I I watched all of that and it was brilliant yes your secrets are not
00:03:19 safe they're all exposed and I found all of the rest and and so I was I was it's
00:03:29 it's well I think I was surprised just because I mean you know I I'm familiar
00:03:35 with your work and you've you've been involved in like you know the fucking
00:03:40 highly successful binding of Isaac so to me I mean you're like a you're like a
00:03:44 you're like a seasoned industry industry fucking professional guy and so like for
00:03:50 you to be watching our our our rinky-dink little shit you know us all like us all
00:03:54 struggling barely barely known artists over here you know we're fine the thought
00:04:01 of anyone watching my channel of anyone being a fan of me is this the
00:04:05 it's my worst nightmare really one of the one day I'm gonna go back in time and
00:04:09 I'm gonna erase my channel from the picture like Marty McFly that's my goal
00:04:13 as a youtuber that we all look forward to that day but so our topic in general is
00:04:19 gonna be indie games but really it's just an excuse to talk about Florian and
00:04:22 his work and I'm really curious about his experience in the industry because
00:04:27 he's very much an indie guy and he's made a bunch of cool shit over the years I
00:04:32 don't know about you guys but as soon as I heard he was gonna be on I I move
00:04:35 my ass straight on over to comics games dot com and checked out all the shit he's
00:04:40 made over the years and I was pretty great embedded right on the website is
00:04:44 Binding of Isaac and you can just fucking play for free fuck paying for it right
00:04:49 but the demo version right yeah that's probably one of the reasons I got so
00:04:53 successful is because there's a free demo that everyone can play on the
00:04:56 internet on the new grounds I didn't play the demo on new grounds before I
00:05:01 ever yeah I played the demo on new grounds I honestly didn't like the demo
00:05:05 because it was pretty limited but then like when I saw the real game and I saw
00:05:09 all the shit that's like in it I all the literal shit that's it you know I was
00:05:17 I was really big into into roguelikes at the time and like I was playing I was
00:05:22 deep deep in the well of dungeon crawl stone soup at that time of my life was
00:05:26 that before you played Isaac I thought it was afterward oh no I definitely was I
00:05:30 was I was playing stone before I found Isaac but yeah and I saw Isaac and so I
00:05:35 had to fucking jump on it yes and well let's just go and by the way I should
00:05:39 I should just say that I have definitely played probably hundreds of hours of
00:05:42 Isaac I feel safe and saying that about myself too were you saying give I was
00:05:46 just gonna say like I think everyone here has played Binding of Isaac at least
00:05:51 the first one I never really got into it so I won't really have like you know
00:05:57 questions about it but I do understand it's pretty great like I've seen people
00:06:02 have a lot of fun with it and I do like roguelikes in general it's just like one
00:06:06 of the biggest things about it is that I like watching people play it wanted
00:06:10 playing it myself almost because I can see them get trolled by my game and it's
00:06:14 glorious yeah dude I was watching on I was watching on your channel which
00:06:23 game squid on YouTube and I was watching a game you were doing with some guy I
00:06:29 don't know a friend of yours who was in a couple of the videos and he did this
00:06:33 this amazing run as it wasn't like it was a new character I had never seen
00:06:38 before because I haven't kept up with every single update but it's like the
00:06:41 last one you unlock it's like this weird devil angel baby thing and like just get
00:06:46 all the fucking power-ups he got I mean it was such an unbelievable beast just
00:06:50 demolishing that game completely it's so satisfying I had played a bunch of
00:06:54 rounds just to get myself back into it so I'd remember what playing the fucking
00:06:58 game was like and I fucked up real bad but it's so glorious to watch people get
00:07:03 those like runaway successful runs and he got all the way to like this new area
00:07:07 called the void that I'd never seen before and beat this guy I don't know
00:07:11 some big white motherfucker who was like the new final double triple boss
00:07:15 oh it's so great I love that kind of shit that's funny why is it such a great
00:07:19 game yeah I I'd never heard of the void either I was playing it back in back in
00:07:25 back in the rat like the early wrath of the lamb yeah that's the very newest DLC
00:07:30 they made for after birth rebirth after birth plus it is called and it has that
00:07:36 stuff in it so that's right yeah so I let me let me let me complain let me
00:07:42 complain about the new about the remakes about about rebirth oh and this was a
00:07:45 big reason we wanted Ben here so we could complain about the new one that
00:07:48 flooring is not involved with just talk about how much he loves the original well
00:07:52 too well I do I want to hear about it I do fucking love the original I mean I
00:07:55 mean game I have played a little bit of rebirth and like gameplay wise it seems
00:07:59 pretty much the same which is fine you know there's a lot more shit in there
00:08:03 which is always cool but like all right there's a bunch of things that really
00:08:07 pissed me off which is the the pixel aesthetic I don't get I don't get why
00:08:11 it was done I really liked you know Edmunds original like hand-drawn wobbly
00:08:16 thing I thought it fit the game the tone of the game way better and the the
00:08:22 fucking cutscenes look like ass in the new look like ass they look like they
00:08:27 look like ass and not even in a way they make sense like not only do they look
00:08:30 worse than the original cutscenes in the original version they also they look
00:08:35 worse in a way that fits the new visual style even less yeah it's it's it's
00:08:42 really dumb they feel a very outsourced to me like they feel separate from the
00:08:49 rest of the game almost because they're that I don't know they're just
00:08:52 unpleasant in their difference in aesthetics from every other thing about
00:08:56 Isaac I mean I got I got really close to getting Platinum God once and then my
00:09:01 save got erased or I sweet I got a new computer yeah yeah and so then I got the
00:09:05 game again in wrath of the lamb and got really close to getting Platinum God
00:09:09 again but then my save got erased again and so by that time I was like you know
00:09:14 what I think I think I'm done with Isaac and so no don't be done with Isaac
00:09:21 rebirth rebirth was out right after that and I didn't I didn't pick up rebirth
00:09:24 because at the time I was like yeah I tried to get back into rebirth as well
00:09:29 when it came out just because you know all the new content but I also just felt
00:09:33 I had I had reached the depths of what I was getting out of Isaac in terms of
00:09:37 you know I was so frustrated getting screwed out of Platinum God twice but
00:09:42 again I want to reiterate though I love this game and played it for literally
00:09:45 hundreds if not thousands of hours for an entire year to a very important
00:09:49 question for Florian do you still make money off of rebirth somehow did you get
00:09:57 did I cut off a little bit did get off sorry oh yeah we talk about money too
00:10:04 much that would just just wouldn't be good I think so oh that's half of my
00:10:09 questions I what about just in general okay do you have any is that what you
00:10:17 wanted to ask oh no no I mean I'm not curious about that at all I'm just
00:10:21 wondering if you saw like penny one from after birth at all since you were such a
00:10:25 major component of making the damn thing is that is that something you're
00:10:29 okay to talk about just a little bit I get a little money don't worry about me
00:10:33 great okay that was another one thing I wanted to know I mean I mean it just
00:10:38 stands to reason because like you fucking don't built the original thing it
00:10:42 would be pretty fucked up if you were just like well I don't that's that's why
00:10:46 I wanted to know that's exactly why I wanted to know because it would be fucked
00:10:49 up if he was cut off so I had to know if he was you know I don't be possible to
00:10:55 just cut me off right there but yeah well I'm imagining I'm imagining like
00:11:01 some like you know fucking Gabe Newell comes in and like you know big in a big
00:11:06 yeah in a big like shoulder padded suit smoking a cigar and says we're buying you
00:11:10 out Florian we brought a dump truck of money to the front of your house and
00:11:18 we're gonna fucking cave your house and it's gonna be a night it's gonna be a
00:11:21 truly ironic death it's just like when my friend sold for a million for a
00:11:27 billion dollars to two billion dollars I was a billion yeah Jesus because it's
00:11:32 like it's like a minecraft is like a platform in itself that people use for
00:11:37 all kinds of bullshit I've just heard enough industry horror stories that I
00:11:42 wanted to be sure that we're not a you know like that that talk well I guess
00:11:47 the fact that you're so willing to talk about Isaac would would suggest that you
00:11:51 have an amicable relationship with the game still yeah oh yes my greatest
00:11:56 pride or maybe that's great that's I'm so glad that that's that that's the case
00:12:02 the only thing that bothers me is that they made the pics lodges like Ben said
00:12:05 but I still don't I don't get it I don't get why that decision was was it to make
00:12:11 it look like I'm shitting myself was it to make it look more like a video game
00:12:18 Isaac character in real life yeah he really is he lives in the basement it's
00:12:24 a nightmare down there it's full of piss and molded mildew and it's a nightmare
00:12:28 for everyone he's he's he's like Isaac is in many ways the true story of my
00:12:34 actual life have you been inspired by Isaac in such a way I like to think Isaac
00:12:41 was inspired by Jesse's real life oh no what if we had like a PCP version of Isaac
00:12:47 like a mod with all the guys of us oh you know I played I played an
00:12:52 undertale mod of Isaac once yeah I played a homestuck mod once and it was
00:12:57 neat oh it's totally doable it's totally doable anyways somebody get on that
00:13:01 somebody out there who knows shit Florian you get on it
00:13:07 my precious time
00:13:10 we're taking it all we're taking it all baby so anyways Edmund just wanted that
00:13:16 rebirth look different and he didn't want them to trace his art in any way and
00:13:20 he wanted it to be his own art style so he passed them into making this this
00:13:26 pixel art style so he had to actually convince them to do it this way well
00:13:30 they gave him a bunch of what I call it like different choices it's like when
00:13:40 someone when you pick out colors for your home it's like it was like that I
00:13:45 suppose so man that okay but he but he just wanted it to look different yes very
00:13:49 different I can sort of understand that I suppose yeah I guess it makes but
00:13:54 reverse is still pretty good it plays well enough unless you record it in
00:13:58 which case it lacks for me it was great I don't know that it's it's really good
00:14:02 for it felt it felt it felt like the old game but expanded which is pretty good
00:14:07 yeah can't it's hard to argue about the the cool new content and that's that's
00:14:12 all very enjoyable I want to ask about like the the initial development of
00:14:16 Isaac because I heard it took like two months like you just hashed that thing
00:14:21 out real quick yeah but about three months it was insane there was so much
00:14:25 development and creativity going on and then we released a completely broken
00:14:30 game and then only years later it's it's it's only only only very broken still
00:14:37 but not not unplayably broken so at last perfect that's man that's awesome I
00:14:44 was wondering I really wanted to talk about since I'm a programmer myself
00:14:48 definitely not on the level of complexity and stuff you do but all I was
00:14:54 just wondering what a nightmare it was to program all the little things in there
00:14:57 like one thing that I was thinking about was must have been tricky to get the you
00:15:01 know those how bombs when they explode next to a rock they make a little
00:15:04 platform appear you know in that hole yeah was with things like that a
00:15:10 nightmare to make or are you just able to do this kind of stuff easily well back
00:15:15 then it was certainly very hard for me I think I've learned a lot over the the
00:15:20 time now but still haven't released any game were you were you a rookie
00:15:25 developer at the time well not not exactly I started hobby programming when
00:15:31 I was 12 because because I was a nerd and and such so get out of here we don't
00:15:39 abide those kind of folks around here oh god I made like 20 different small
00:15:45 flash games over the years before Isaac and then I've hardly made any sins
00:15:50 because I finally fulfilled my dream of being able to do nothing all day and not
00:15:56 that's the dream by the way we all speak everyone in this everyone in the
00:16:02 PCP we all need to figure out like how to find something we could do with
00:16:07 residual pay that's what we're that's the golden goose we're all missing out on
00:16:11 clearly is residuals hey I was since we were bringing up your your old games I
00:16:16 wanted to mention a few that I enjoyed from your from your page I played I
00:16:21 don't know if this was the C word but on your page is just cunt which you also
00:16:26 made with Edmond that exists loved that game it was art was beautiful and it was
00:16:32 simple and fun I have not played it go to comics games calm it's great hang on
00:16:38 hang on did you make oh god I'm gonna be so embarrassed if this is wrong but did
00:16:43 you make triachnid I did actually yes I fucking loved triachnid like at least
00:16:50 at least five times back there's a game called cunt how can I play it go to
00:16:57 comics magical games comics with a K dash games dot com it's you know what I
00:17:02 heard is when you play the game of cunts you win or you die this is very
00:17:08 correct yes there was another game that I really this is the one I played the
00:17:12 most out of all the ones on your page now that I play every single one but but
00:17:15 seed where you play as a dude wearing a cowboy hat riding a sperm through like
00:17:21 downtown Manhattan as like the army comes out and tries to kill you and
00:17:25 there's this awesome mechanic in there where when you you control yourself with
00:17:28 your I think with oh no you just continually move forward and then use
00:17:33 the arrow keys to like rotate yourself but there's this great thing you can do
00:17:37 with you the tail of the sperm which is when they're shooting missiles at you
00:17:41 which happens constantly if you whip the tail around really fast you can
00:17:45 deflect the missiles away I just thought that was the tightest fucking shit and
00:17:49 that guy that seemed like it was to be really hard to do there must have been
00:17:52 like some state you enter when you move like at a certain speed or you rotate at
00:17:57 a certain speed that like it triggers that effect to happen on missiles when
00:18:01 they hit man that was awesome it was super cool oh man I like that game I
00:18:06 love doing that game there was an animation called sperm rider where it
00:18:11 was this very sperm and was that in like like a pencil yes it was just like
00:18:19 the game because then I went and contact the artist and I did I convinced him to
00:18:24 make a game or did he convince me but I defy message him first it was so cool
00:18:29 because he made all this pencil drawn art for it and then he could just ride
00:18:34 around on your sperm you know why you're a hero to me for you sweet you're a
00:18:40 hero to me Florian because you've done what I'm increasingly getting into doing
00:18:44 and it's that you you have like a vision for a project and you make it and you
00:18:49 outsource whatever you need to outsource that you don't personally have the
00:18:53 skills to do and it's specifically art for this stuff and you just you don't
00:18:58 let those things get in your way right like a lot of people might give up like
00:19:02 when I made games back in the day it was always a big fucking headache to to
00:19:06 worry about art and I had my sister do it for some she was garbage at the time
00:19:10 so it's terrible and a bell bell bell really has an unbelievable fucking
00:19:16 background I don't know what I tried to play the cut I tried to play the game of
00:19:23 cunts I didn't die he died did a bug crawl up your dick and made you explode I
00:19:32 didn't I don't know what was happening I was it's a beautiful game though everyone
00:19:37 go check it out it looks it looks I highly I highly fucking recommend
00:19:41 triac that I didn't play that one I'm going to it's so it's so great I take it
00:19:47 that that because you know Edmund McMillan is rather well known for the
00:19:53 sort of scatological humor of games like Isaac and in all his other games but I
00:19:57 take it that you also have a similar sense of humor even without him around
00:20:03 I made about three games that are that have sperm as a main character
00:20:09 that's more than your average person I'd say yeah
00:20:16 most people round out around one yeah you're ahead of the bell curve there and I
00:20:21 think only one of them I did with Edmund but it might be two I might I might not
00:20:25 remember that right that's great that's awesome it's just it helps me to
00:20:30 understand why you're a fan of the PCP because this is exactly the kind of thing
00:20:34 I'd expect our fans to be making yeah this is a podcast primarily about me
00:20:39 shitting myself hey but I was curious about one while my court of clowns talks
00:20:46 amongst themselves if I'm not totally fucked up in my timeline you're getting
00:20:52 together with Edmund would have been oh wait you know you know I was gonna I was
00:20:56 going to say getting together for Binding of Isaac would have happened
00:20:59 after the runaway success of Super Meat Boy which I mean he was already getting
00:21:03 fairly well known but that was like his big breakout success and I was going to
00:21:07 ask like how did you guys meet but then I realized you had already done games
00:21:11 before that point so my whole question is retarded so never mind yeah that's right
00:21:15 little known fact I've actually been doing stuff with Edmund for a long time
00:21:19 in fact he got me into game development at one point because oh my god I mean not
00:21:24 precisely to game development but he was a mentor for me because I never knew
00:21:28 that you could make money off games I was just a little boy playing around with
00:21:31 little yeah little yeah he was the best kind of mentor that's that teaches you
00:21:35 how to make money oh yeah right such a good man dude he was your column he was
00:21:41 the commoner to your Simone what a beautiful thing he told me I could go
00:21:44 and get a sponsorship for my game and then I I think I got 500 bucks for for
00:21:50 making a little game that was basically a remake of Pac-Man and it was amazing I
00:21:55 assume that's that's Pac over here that's the one I think that's the first
00:22:00 one I properly released it plays horribly but I did the art in it at least so
00:22:07 it's all me oh that's beautiful what a wonderful story so I'm so happy to hear
00:22:13 that your relationship with Edmund is still positive I just I didn't know and
00:22:17 that's great we started doing podcasts on my channel as well oh really I had no
00:22:23 idea I have to go listen to those he keeps telling me he'll be around but then
00:22:26 he keeps getting busy the last excuse he was he was that he got sick from his
00:22:31 baby so
00:22:37 he's a little baby man speaking speaking of your of your YouTube channel
00:22:43 well I guess I watched I watched it and I saw it and I was just just like I was
00:22:49 surprised to hear that you were listening to the PCP being being a
00:22:53 successful dude as you are I was surprised that you had fucking ventured into
00:22:56 the cesspool of humanity that is fucking YouTube YouTube video content oh yeah
00:23:02 what brought that about what what urged that that move yes that's right not only
00:23:08 am I an inspiration to you but also the other way around because I really want
00:23:12 to make video games no videos YouTube videos yes and first I started out I
00:23:20 just wanted to do lazy let's plays like not online or whoever they just upload
00:23:24 daily and it's just them playing but now I now that I've seen what you guys do
00:23:29 it's more interesting to to attempt to do it that way though I obviously don't
00:23:34 have as much time so well I mean I do have time I just have to work on games
00:23:39 beautiful that's beautiful to hear my friend sweet so very gratified are you
00:23:45 we could do that also terrifying yes but I want to let's just jump into the
00:23:51 other major thing here so you've got a new game that's percolating that's
00:23:56 work that's that's being cooked as as we speak and it's called poor mouse and
00:24:02 everyone should go check out the trailer for it on on his GameSquid YouTube
00:24:06 channel so I think I had everybody here watch the trailer but would you
00:24:11 describe to us what the the main thrust of that game is gonna be oh yes so you
00:24:17 are a mouse and it's very dangerous even though you can fly with your ears
00:24:21 because a magical mouse you still have to do that's the tagline right there very
00:24:25 dangerous even though you can fly so I wanted to make it so it's basically like
00:24:32 Super Mario meets Dark Souls but I'm sure I'll completely fail and it'll just
00:24:37 turn out to be the next no man's guy I mean Super Mario meets Dark Souls is
00:24:44 about as marketable a premise as you can fucking even even think of so it sounds
00:24:49 like a strong start there it's true especially with a cute animal in the
00:24:54 mix it's perfect never hurts this debatable because the mainstream games
00:25:00 they're not really about Dark Souls or platforming so it's not mainstream
00:25:05 marketability but I suppose indie marketability should be pretty good you
00:25:10 know you know what your problem is with that game you need a couple more white
00:25:13 guys that's what you need that couple couple of white guys that's what's
00:25:17 missing from that you just need it I don't see a white beefcake space marine
00:25:22 anyway yeah I can't relate it to be Dark Souls like enough for a body
00:25:29 video to make a Dark Souls like video on it and then you'll have an instant I
00:25:34 wish that guy still exists huh yeah god got tired of that guy a year or ten ago
00:25:46 I still make content it's fairly entertaining he only existed on like on
00:25:52 Dark Souls Eve night is about to be made that's that's when the blood moon is
00:26:01 full that is true but it's because they've been making Dark Souls 3 DLC so he so
00:26:06 it is still dark I guess I forgot because I haven't played anything since
00:26:10 Dark Souls 2 anyway wasn't it wasn't it though I got this is my this is my
00:26:21 Dark Souls 2 this is my Dark Souls 2 story when I got to the Queen and I tried
00:26:25 to shoot her with an arrow and there was an invisible wall and I was like this is
00:26:29 this is no Dark Souls Dark Souls 1 Dark Souls 1 let me shoot Gwen Gwendolyn fuck
00:26:36 this game when I hear you fool Gwendolyn yes yes yeah well it also let me shoot
00:26:40 Gwendolyn but whatever that's true you know about this bug where you could shoot
00:26:43 minus from the DLC from I do I did that I fucking did that shit I killed him what
00:26:49 what the fuck what you can shoot manners from outside the boss arena if
00:26:53 you aim it right no shit yeah it's a very it's a very pussy way to win
00:26:58 sucks thanks to I know thanks to Matthew Matosis that you can shoot the
00:27:04 man-eaters in in or one of the man-eaters in Demon's Souls but I never
00:27:07 played Demon's Souls so what a ton of arrows stand where he can't reach you
00:27:12 shoot at him for hours and hours now he's dead
00:27:18 who was that sexy boy who said that I just watched that recently just just
00:27:23 earlier today I walked into the living room and Davoo was playing Demon's Souls
00:27:26 and I started saying Demon's Souls yeah and he joined in and it was a fun
00:27:32 family time from from soft boys everything good I did I did seven years
00:27:42 ago just like Florian with binding of Isaac brothers has been brothers
00:27:55 I'll be I'll be someone again I'll show you please please do I mean hey I was
00:28:02 curious so you're working on multiplayer for for poor mouse that seems like a god
00:28:09 damn nightmare it is it is pretty much terrible before I started making poor
00:28:15 mouse I was going to make a multiplayer game but then it was completely fucked
00:28:20 up because I couldn't get a single thing right so and then I worked on poor
00:28:26 mouse but now after many years of learning about unity and multiplayer I
00:28:32 think I finally have a chance of making it work this time hey a quick question
00:28:37 what was that cancelled game about oh yes for the secret it's about gladiators
00:28:43 firm and that's all I'll tell you sperm gladiators I assume oh no not dig
00:28:49 fighting how how long how long has poor mouse been in development now I think
00:28:56 more than two years already and I was supposed to make it come out on early
00:29:01 anxious but then I delayed because I was going to make multiplayer instead which
00:29:04 would take me forever and it means I can't release the game until it's at
00:29:09 least a lot better than it needs to have a really good multiplayer mode so that
00:29:13 people can instantly get into the multiplayer mode and not just be in the
00:29:18 early axis and then lose interest because multiplayer requires a fan base to
00:29:22 to be active around the clock oh and you were telling me just the other day how
00:29:27 much you love the arena in Dark Souls 3 and the kind of instant multiplayer you
00:29:31 can do is that what you're looking for to get if possible for poor mouse yeah I
00:29:36 really do play Dark Souls a lot now this DLC with the the arena it's amazing and
00:29:43 I want to make it so that there's a bandit's mode in poor mouse where you can
00:29:48 kill other mice and then they drop their seeds and you can use the seeds as a
00:29:52 weapon but but also you need to you need to collect seeds and whoever gets 50
00:29:59 seeds first wins it would be awesome yes so like okay so so gameplay in poor
00:30:08 mouse it's like so it's like platforming but with like gliding and
00:30:12 there's combat and and what's like okay so it's a competitive multiplayer scene
00:30:18 where you where you like compete for seeds like you run around you get you
00:30:21 steal each other's seeds what have you I'm trying I'm trying to I'm trying to pay
00:30:25 myself you know can you can you relate in terms that we understand say it's the
00:30:29 Dark Souls of X and then we'll understand what that means oh boy I already did
00:30:34 that he did in fact the Dark Souls of Mario oh shit you're right so how much
00:30:42 of that two-year development time is just because you moved to 3d because it
00:30:47 looks like this is a fully 3d game well it was always going to be 3d
00:30:51 but I hack now I mean I mean moving 3d I didn't I didn't mean I got it that game
00:30:57 I bet you in general actually it took me forever to learn that oh my god it is
00:31:02 so hard but then again I I'm probably just really bad because I was just a
00:31:07 young boy of 21 years when I made Isaac and I only knew how to program in flash
00:31:13 and nothing else and so that's why the performance of Isaac is so poor because
00:31:17 it's made in flash so moving away from that alone was hard but then yeah moving
00:31:23 into 3d is difficult all the more because you would not believe how hard it
00:31:29 is to make this 3d rotate rotations work they have a whole new type of rotation
00:31:34 called quaternions and they all they're pretty much not even understandable
00:31:41 hang on what's what's the name of the rotations quaternions quaternions yes
00:31:47 there's also I'm a math I'm a math guy I thought I thought I might be able to
00:31:53 flex my math nuts a little bit but I guess not you might have heard of rotate
00:31:56 you along the fourth dimensional axis or something that's what it sounds like
00:32:00 yes I think somewhat there's a different one is called Euler angles and that's
00:32:04 just three axis and it it's just three different numbers and that's
00:32:09 understandable but then it gets translated into quaternions and that's
00:32:13 how the computer understands it oh my god so it's a lot more complex that way you
00:32:19 know I've actually done a little bit of developing in unity myself before I
00:32:23 started YouTube with Ben I was working on a 2d platformer in yeah with my
00:32:29 buddy in in unity and I we we definitely stopped short of anything and it wasn't
00:32:35 3d but I'm a real I'm a real boy too it's got some levels it's got some
00:32:47 levels yeah what what what do you what do you hello did someone just leave the
00:32:54 call monkey joint but he's muted monkey oh right he's free gonna start
00:32:57 recording himself you can jump in if you want monkey I don't give a fuck about
00:33:01 anything I made a game once I made a video game on RPG maker for steam oh boy
00:33:08 you go you're you play as a guy me and I go there's a tree and you go up to the
00:33:16 tree and you click on the tree and the tree says it's a tree or some shit I
00:33:18 don't know that's as far as I got what I did it I made it what does it say I did
00:33:24 have trees say just something I don't remember but you could read a tree you
00:33:27 could read signs oh I know what it says it says it says I wish I was a flutter
00:33:31 shy oh I got him the ponies in bring in that's bring a pony game of course I
00:33:40 should have known yeah that's why it was never completed because I didn't know
00:33:44 make it a pony game yeah you would have gotten all the fan funding do you miss
00:33:48 that how how big of a brony are you Florian we're all fucking deep oh no
00:33:55 that's the most important question of all how many stocky markers of the main six
00:34:01 do you own none but I don't believe in such childish material goods but oh yeah
00:34:15 I mean either me neither that's that's what I was gonna say to it's much more
00:34:23 mature to play games to make games where you're a penis trying to fuck a giant
00:34:27 cunt floating in space you know but it is the finest higher level of maturity here
00:34:34 but anyways it's good that you brought up the ponies because I was wondering did
00:34:38 you notice all the the pony references in Isaac of course I know that there's
00:34:44 the spacebar item right the unicorn horn it turns you invincible I'm sorry it's
00:34:49 been a while since I played yes and oh me I did that you absolute bastard that
00:35:00 unicorn horn has saved me many a run oh it's pretty bad though it's like a
00:35:07 good starting item I like I like it cuz it lets you get it lets you get over like
00:35:11 you know spike doors and stuff the problem yeah that's it's got some
00:35:14 utilities but the problem with that thing is anytime you're using it a boss
00:35:18 like you can deal damage by running into things with it but you never can I
00:35:22 could never properly time when it ends so I'd usually just be mashing up against
00:35:26 a boss when my invincibility ran out and that would take damage and I blame you
00:35:29 for all of those thank you for try hunt that boss get hit dude wouldn't like a
00:35:37 pony ducky marker or be like sideways dude well sure how would you hug a
00:35:43 sideways the body the body pillow you know it you don't be appropriate you
00:35:51 know how ponies have legs if you had legs off the side oh you know what they
00:35:56 should do you know those big pillows that kind of have the parts that extend
00:36:00 around that you can kind of put your arms on when you're leaning back on it
00:36:02 there should be a pony one like that with the legs you know with the legs you
00:36:06 know that's an add-on that's an add-on for the pillow you got to buy that
00:36:17 separately
00:36:21 naive boy you didn't think of where to put the pussy hey Florian what do you
00:36:26 think about the best game ever undertale oh boy I was gonna say your
00:36:31 very first podcast was about the best game ever now we're talking about it
00:36:35 again the binding of Isaac perfect oh yeah you know wait wait yeah didn't I'm
00:36:41 didn't I bring up binding of Isaac you said it was your favorite game of all
00:36:45 time and then your mind in the very same podcast it's amazing what an arc
00:36:51 you have gone through and then you just went and went to suck underdale's cock
00:36:55 again just like everyone I remember in the best game ever podcast I brought up
00:37:01 Isaac as one of the games I've gotten the most fucking enjoyment out of just
00:37:04 the amount of fucking you know time I spent on it and you know loved a lot
00:37:10 and stuff I can think of at least five or six games which Ben has referred to
00:37:15 as his favorite game of all time there's many different ways it's like it's the
00:37:19 the best game ever conundrum is is is like a jewel that you should you twist
00:37:24 hither and thither and and the light and the light reflects into your eyes from
00:37:28 all of the different ways and angles what anyway how do you like undertale
00:37:35 for Intel with the greatest game us with the tail of undertail I'm just here to
00:37:42 talk about under oh boy undertail have I got a tail for you yeah a very short
00:37:48 tail in fact because I watched video game donkeys video about underdale and I
00:37:53 decided I'd never have to play it that's a shame because it's a good game
00:38:00 and it's pretty short but whatever do whatever the fuck you want I mean we
00:38:04 on undertale I haven't I haven't seen donkeys video on it but like undertale
00:38:09 is the worst fucking game to let's play of all time except for that one time the
00:38:12 flow he calls you out that's great everything else about undertale is just
00:38:16 makes for a miserable let's playing experience oh my god so emotionally
00:38:20 incidentally speaking of let's plays I think I think we owe it to Florian to at
00:38:25 some point do a better binding of Isaac let's play I was not happy with my
00:38:32 performance I spent I spent like 20 minutes in the fucking game room trying
00:38:38 to fucker trying to fuck around with you just trying to optimize that's how you
00:38:42 win everyone yeah I'm fucking love that shit I love I love nitpicking and
00:38:48 fucking you just just fucking around with the odds and just spending spending
00:38:52 five spending an hour to save five minutes and trying to eat out every
00:38:55 every possible advantage I can it's it's actually fun for me to do things like
00:38:59 fuck around with the game room in the heart now's an appropriate time to tell
00:39:03 you did you that you are as big sack as shit for not appreciating the the the
00:39:08 hard work that the optimization that you have to put in if you want return on
00:39:12 your investment of your runs and Isaac you have to do the grinding you're a
00:39:16 hack fraud how about how about I mean like sometimes you can get a run where
00:39:22 yeah you just get lucky and you get good stuff so you don't have to grind you
00:39:27 make your own you find yourself in a run you find yourself in a run where you
00:39:31 need that level of luck in order every time you just grab that run and go to a
00:39:36 good run what are you talking about you grinding since you can find an Isaac you
00:39:41 just fucking go around and found a way you can play the arcade that's all yeah
00:39:46 you you if you know how to play smart and like conserve your resources and like
00:39:50 you know when when is it best to use your keys and bombs and stuff and like you
00:39:54 know how what do you have to do like it are you looking for a really well what
00:39:58 are you what are you yeah what do you got to do to make a devil room happen you
00:40:01 know like these are the kind of things that you got to keep in mind you can't
00:40:05 anything but you can maximize your odds of getting a good run it's not it's not
00:40:09 all luck because to a certain extent you can control the odds if you know you're
00:40:13 doing well I'm just I'm just I'm not saying it's all luck I'm saying that if
00:40:17 you can have runs where you just get lucky from the outset and then you do
00:40:23 better throughout the game then when you have a run that's like shit at the
00:40:27 outset and then you have to grind for 15 minutes scrap that run and go keep keep
00:40:32 killing yourself you find a good grinding can make the difference and in any
00:40:36 case as I said fucking eating eating out a barely eating out of victory from the
00:40:40 jaws of defeat is just fucking way more fun than yeah that's right yeah you if
00:40:46 you give up on a run that doesn't look great and that's perfectly acceptable
00:40:49 but it is always a good idea to put in the extra time and effort to you know
00:40:54 whatever ways appropriate if you get fucked of course you can abandon a run
00:40:58 like I probably should have abandoned that run early on when I got and I think
00:41:02 I got P and I got some other thing that was ranged down and it was just just a
00:41:06 fucking bullshit set up from the get yeah yeah polyphemus one of the best
00:41:10 items but I think I actually know that in my my latest well yeah that's right
00:41:15 I got P and polyphemus and it was just a terrible combination yeah polyphemus
00:41:21 didn't get didn't used to give you a short speed but down but now it does but
00:41:25 have you played to the eternal edition I don't think any of us have how
00:41:31 recent was that one or two years I never remember but you definitely had it on in
00:41:36 in that video but you'd have to enable the hard mode for it to work because then
00:41:41 you open yourself up for a whole new world of bullshit there's all kinds of
00:41:45 champions that just do in same things they wouldn't imagine and that was the
00:41:50 best part about it you gotta try it yeah I was that eternal mode cuz like I
00:41:56 booted up steam cuz I wanted cuz I was I was like let's make it let's make a
00:41:59 binding of Isaac play let's do this podcast to binding of Isaac and I
00:42:03 signed into my steam on digits computer only to find oh shit I don't even have
00:42:07 it on fucking steam I don't wear the piracy I guess I must
00:42:12 are you a goddamn pirate you know what but you know what I made up for it because
00:42:16 I bought the game just to record that fucking podcast I paid my dues that's a
00:42:20 good pirate yeah private here I redeemed I redeemed myself hey I was
00:42:28 curious about something so one of the coolest things about Isaac is the
00:42:31 ridiculous complexity of the different item variations that stack and cause all
00:42:37 kinds of crazy effects and I always imagined getting those to work
00:42:41 properly and never completely fuck the game was one of the most challenging
00:42:46 things to do is that accurate yes it is because I completely failed at that for
00:42:53 example you get Ipacac and you get my reflection then oh yeah it kills if you
00:43:00 would expect that it would home back in on you and it would be annoying but you
00:43:05 would not believe the level of how annoying it is because for some reason
00:43:08 the bullets glitched up really high so you couldn't see them and then it would
00:43:12 hit you out of nowhere how much how much okay here's a question I just thought
00:43:20 up but I'm kind of interested in the answer to how much of like item
00:43:24 interaction is like is is just emergent versus how much like code like how much
00:43:30 it has to be specifically coded about item interactions like like like how much
00:43:36 of that code is like is there like just for the interaction part versus how much
00:43:41 is just like the item has its own behavior and the two just kind of the
00:43:45 two just kind of modify the the tier the tiers or the game separately you know
00:43:49 what I'm saying well ideally would have it so that most of the things would only
00:43:53 be their own self-contained thing and then they would automatically stack with
00:43:57 everything but of course I did it completely wrong because I had no idea
00:44:01 how big this game was going to turn out so when when I had when Edmund told me
00:44:06 there's an item that gives you double damage I just just said if item then
00:44:10 double damage but then they're never more more items so it got more more
00:44:16 confusing and I never really had it set up so it would work so I had to redo all
00:44:21 of that so it could have multiple items that give you more damage without it
00:44:25 being weird you need some sort of complex formula for calculating damage now
00:44:29 probably or something's indeed well well there was I know there's like the
00:44:33 in-game menu that kind of shows your stats it's like like like there's like a
00:44:38 bar that fills up on the pause menu but like I don't know on most of my good
00:44:43 runs I would find that like I maxed out the bar I would max out like at the
00:44:46 damage bar and then you know the bar would the bar continued infinitely but
00:44:50 like you couldn't really see it or you know like like like the bar itself would
00:44:54 only show you so much and then there would be tons of shit going on behind
00:44:57 the scenes that was not like you know visibly tracking on that stats screen
00:45:02 or that's how it always felt to me yeah the bar isn't very accurate and it was
00:45:05 added after the fact so it's more of a I guess it it kind of determines how much
00:45:13 damage one single tier does but it's still there's still things that that
00:45:18 that make it more complex like when you get the lump of coal that makes the
00:45:23 tears grow steadily larger yeah that for example doesn't even show up in that
00:45:27 stat I always had there was something I was always clear on do your tears
00:45:34 automatically turned red when you got past a certain damage threshold or was
00:45:38 that like an item visual an item specific visual thing I always felt like
00:45:41 when my tears got strong enough even if there was no item that was specifically
00:45:46 made the tears red they would turn red anyway was I just fucking crazy I had it
00:45:50 that way but they removed it in in reburse because apparently that wasn't
00:45:54 the intended way of Edmund so I guess I just made that randomly and Edmund that
00:46:00 son of a fucking bitch you know let's just talk some shit about that guy that
00:46:06 piece of that shit don't you just hate him tell us how you want him to die tell
00:46:11 us all the dirt tell us the deeds hey Edmund I'm sure you're listening right
00:46:16 now the worst man who ever lived your words not mine he said the worst man of
00:46:24 all time do you think you listen to this actually well he said I should send it
00:46:30 to him so probably more like more like Deadmond because you're gonna kill him
00:46:36 is what you said now hey Edmund hey Edmund leave us a comment patreon.com
00:46:42 slash patreon.com slash Ben St yeah I did it yes please I don't even have a
00:46:49 patron you could just buy Isaac can I get money from that yeah yeah do that and
00:46:54 you'll get a cool you can confirm that that you make money every time we buy
00:46:57 Isaac yeah but I don't say how much so I was gonna ask you know obviously your
00:47:09 your friends Edmund who's a sort of a superstar of the of the indie gaming
00:47:14 world do you have any indie gaming friends or anything who you you want to
00:47:18 promote like who you think deserve more attention that's a great question there's
00:47:23 this there's this kid Phil Fish have been hearing a lot about recently you know
00:47:27 really was in the news again I probably I don't know oh god well I guess there's
00:47:37 that one guy who made Orbox C which he could buy on Steam he's a really good
00:47:41 friend and it's a good game and no one has bought it and it's a tragedy what's
00:47:45 the game I never heard of it Orbox C it used to be a flash game but then he made
00:47:50 a lot of levels and put it on steam and it's pretty good it's possibly some
00:47:53 links in the description to or or boxy yes ORBO X space C right let's all buy
00:48:01 it right now let's play oh god I just logged in the steam I got all these
00:48:07 gifts people gave me games what's happening oh it's like Christmas of
00:48:12 morning you're funny caught up to you are you on are you on are you on steam

00:48:46 god damn this guy is savage so good so good at what I'm just turning it back
00:48:53 every time rubs hands so what are what are some of your favorite games as of
00:49:00 late any recommendations you have for us oh yes there's certainly one that I've
00:49:06 been playing and hating and I just can't stop myself from playing and
00:49:10 hating it it's called enter the gungeon it's the worst game and definitely the
00:49:17 worst game and you can't stop playing it it's it's I saw you had a video called
00:49:22 like how to improve into the gungeon that sounds fascinating oh I got a lot
00:49:27 of hate for that one now gun guns kind of similar to Isaac isn't it's like another
00:49:34 oh it's very similar only that it's not bugged but also it's too hard I cannot
00:49:40 believe that there would be a game that's too hard but it is I always assumed
00:49:44 that the harder the better but enter the gun to improve me wrong it's too hard so
00:49:50 like how does it feel knowing that you basically caused this this huge boom in
00:49:55 roguelite games because I want to say Isaac seems like the flashpoint of this
00:50:00 for sure literally flash oh yeah well my question my follow-up question to that
00:50:08 would be do you agree with that like I mean yes I have created roguelike it
00:50:14 is true yes I mean I I know it was I know it was a thing before like roguelike
00:50:20 elements were already creeping into like other genres and like genre mixing
00:50:24 before Isaac but it has only grown it has only grown since that's why that's
00:50:30 why I said roguelite like this genre of things that take roguelike elements and
00:50:34 then you know apply some other game style to it like in the in the wake of Isaac
00:50:39 there's definitely been like an explosion of these you know we've got like risk of
00:50:44 rain and FTL and dance dance Crypt of the Necro dancer and all that how do you
00:50:53 how do you feel about all those games you fan of the the roguelite genre well
00:50:57 I do love roguelike very much but the problem is that they're all filthy
00:51:02 pixel art I just wait for the day when someone will make a beautiful 3d roguelike
00:51:07 game that doesn't play like ass because I've only played once that that play like
00:51:12 ass or they pixel art but it's not been one that didn't apply to these did you
00:51:17 ever play dungeon crawlstone suit I did not but I'm sure that looks and plays
00:51:22 like ass it's not it's too basic it's basically like ass it is far it's not
00:51:31 asking me but it basically might as well yeah great yeah um what was that one
00:51:38 uh there was one 3d I love asking what are you talking about it's pure ask you
00:51:44 ask is pure it's just funny because it sounds like ass don't you understand
00:51:49 it plays like ass key sure I got you very very mature very mature oh yes if
00:51:59 only I could poop and piss on everything yeah that you'd be like Jesse yeah my
00:52:07 hero me pooping and peeing on everything and everybody every day and on
00:52:14 everything pooping and peeing on everything here I go one two three and
00:52:22 up oh yes p-style too perfect yeah you know his p-style I know all your
00:52:40 secrets do you know but chugger too I couldn't actually I I got like one
00:52:45 minute into that and I couldn't give it all try you really should you gotta
00:52:55 follow and you've got to follow through to the end on but sugar yeah it's all
00:52:59 about and please leave a comment because I want to coming of age tail much like
00:53:03 the binding of Isaac it is but chugger has probably the most the most
00:53:09 shockingly deep narrative of any retarded ass song you'll ever hear oh sweet
00:53:15 it's great it's by it by the way let's let's plug your channel your YouTube
00:53:19 channel is game squid right oh yeah you gotta check it out it's just like these
00:53:24 guys but with developer content oh man freeing which is far more valuable and
00:53:29 good so go check that out it's like it's like it's like what we do but from
00:53:34 someone who knows what the fuck they're talking about yeah yeah yep that's right
00:53:39 it's actually I'm curious have you done anything to promote your channel because
00:53:43 it is shockingly low view counts considering well actually it turned out
00:53:48 but when I started it was just bullshit it was just let's place and they weren't
00:53:53 even good and then my partner left and I got someone else it didn't start out
00:53:59 very well and whenever I made when I made Isaac a first day I never made I
00:54:04 never promoted myself in fact I didn't even do interviews because I was so shy
00:54:09 in basement dwelling so now that I want to be famous I I have all these hurdles
00:54:15 and then they can only get my my fame drip thread from me by Edmund I am
00:54:21 delighted to be a part of that process whatever whatever small amount yeah
00:54:25 thanks oh yeah does Edmund help promote you oh yeah occasionally he definitely
00:54:32 promoted the eternal update for a little bit and people played it and then
00:54:38 they decided it was bullshit and then they discovered that it was meant to be
00:54:44 bullshit oh good so you're basically still like that came out after after birth
00:54:55 right like you're still developing elements of the original Isaac even
00:54:58 while the new versions out yeah I I think I how when did I start on that was
00:55:04 that before we burst came out before after birth came out anyways I I did I
00:55:09 decided to delay it's a three births could have its day or after birth but
00:55:13 it no one really cared about eternal addition but that was fine because it
00:55:18 was just a minor thing I just yeah I mean I guess it's a little bit confusing
00:55:24 some things I mean I didn't even know I played after birth but I wasn't really
00:55:27 aware of what was going on with the parallel development despite being a
00:55:31 pretty big fan at the time it came out so I guess it just got lost in the shuffle
00:55:35 a little bit unfortunately oh yes all the bad reviews even though it was all
00:55:40 free so it was a lot of free content at least yeah what like what what changes
00:55:46 were there in eternal addition because like apparently I bought eternal
00:55:51 addition without even noticing I was just I just want original Isaac and
00:55:56 that's why you get it for free if you have wrath of the lamb because yeah that
00:56:00 way you can uninstall it if you want but you can also just play it for free and
00:56:05 it's great so basically it has these new eternal champions which are just white
00:56:10 champions and they have in the same patterns and they do bullet hell things
00:56:14 and there was a bunch of little fixes and they really troll you hard at times
00:56:19 like that you know that boss that splits into little pieces the fistula no
00:56:26 that the mini boss actually so he he has a power where he recombines if two pieces
00:56:32 of the same size hit each other so you could you could get that on an early
00:56:37 level and you'd have to fight him for for half an hour before he stops doing
00:56:40 that does he regain a little bit of health when a when that happens or
00:56:44 something oh yes but it gets less the longer you fight him so it's not completely
00:56:48 insane it's almost like you thought about how to implement this pretty cool
00:56:52 pretty cool yeah maybe we'll have to I I definitely want to see Ben try to play
00:57:01 this so we should definitely play all the time kind of let's play a great oh
00:57:05 okay yeah so to do that you have to do it on hard mode to get these bullshit
00:57:09 champions oh yeah all right that's what we'll do then you should do an Isaac
00:57:15 race I you know I think it's just too hard for most of us I think we can get
00:57:23 well we can we can just fucking play Isaac in parallel and it'd be like you
00:57:27 know who who wins yeah basically like that and you just edit it together I
00:57:31 mean Ben Ben Jesse and Nate are all pretty hardcore Isaac players so that's
00:57:36 that's three right there and I am good at being shit at video games using
00:57:42 playing Isaac right now you guys didn't even know it that's how good I am I'm
00:57:47 the sneakiest at video games well Jesse your IRL life doesn't count get out of
00:57:52 that basement go live your life go be a real boy mom's coming for you I'm just
00:58:00 thinking about the fact that Jesse is literally in a shit filled basement like
00:58:04 it destroyed well I don't know I guess it's all cleaned up now right or how how
00:58:11 wrecked is the basement currently Jesse well I'm in it so pretty bad so it's
00:58:17 more filthy than it was before I came home yes oh the antagonist is mom just
00:58:29 like in real life that's yeah yeah HIPPO are you also firing up Isaac is this
00:58:38 way everybody's going quiet is everyone just playing Isaac playing or boxy
00:58:42 because it's on a mini clip I tried to play Isaac I turned on Isaac just now
00:58:47 but then I realized I still have the undertale mod installed so it was like
00:58:52 I was playing the wrong game no give me out of here
00:59:00 game sense could actually get bought flies in his lemon pipe oh my god
00:59:08 fantastic gotta get munchy on this let's play was it monthly was it munchy that
00:59:14 tweeted about that didn't someone tweet about that recently that that that
00:59:18 binding of Isaac is bought flies in your lemon pipe yeah yeah you okay sick well
00:59:25 classic I sure do take a crap how about you so why don't you tell us your
00:59:35 future plans I'm very interested to know what your you know five ten year plan is
00:59:40 as a game developer where do you see yourself going or maybe as a youtuber
00:59:44 maybe you I mean maybe long-term you'd like to get away from game dev I mean I
00:59:48 hope not but perhaps it feels that if I had access to YouTube and if I had been
00:59:54 shy I probably could have had a pretty good YouTube career but now I'll just
00:59:58 have to start now it's not too late I think it's still big I think it's still
01:00:03 big in your that's why I was astounded that you would you know condescend to
01:00:07 speak to us lowly plebs from your pedestal of a real game dev who's made
01:00:12 one of my favorite games of my life and you know just yeah all that shit it's
01:00:18 the first time we've had someone who's a fan of the show who like does work that
01:00:24 we respect I got to say I like I like where this is going I like where this is
01:00:28 going good mom kiss not listening anyway well like you know I mean the PCP is
01:00:36 just a bunch of youtubers and we've had other youtuber well yeah I'm special
01:00:43 go yeah sure yeah I always forget that with the furtive the furtive Ben
01:00:52 Saint so easily forgotten I guess I guess what I'm trying to say is that like I
01:00:58 hate that guy we have on youtubers who we like but I think that everyone in the
01:01:03 PCP thinks that we're better youtubers than everybody anyways so it's like you
01:01:08 know we have on people who we like their work but you know I it's not like I
01:01:13 think any of them are better than me at this job but then you are someone who's
01:01:17 made something that none of us even could make and all of us are fans of and
01:01:21 think is great and so it's it was that I think that's why it was so shocking to
01:01:25 us to find out that you were not just watching the video of binding of Isaac
01:01:31 but actually a huge fan of the channel and we were just like how could it be
01:01:35 possible that someone who's done it a real thing it's very it's very
01:01:39 gratifying that someone who's not some kind of fucked up wasteoid dwee
01:01:44 bazoid waste of space asshole like the rest of our fans like the rest of our
01:01:50 fans like the rest of you fans listening at home would be watching our shit
01:01:55 thank you with you little pissant YouTube channels oh we inspired you oh
01:02:01 it didn't inspire you enough obviously cuz you stink you all stink we didn't
01:02:07 inspire you enough because you still haven't put that bullet in that chamber
01:02:10 yet we're waiting for it I'll get to that already buddy incidentally if if
01:02:15 there are any people who have who have made real things that any of us have
01:02:19 heard of that watch the show let us know it really boosts our egos strongly yeah
01:02:26 yeah oh but I'm not that great I'm just one of those annoying commenters you
01:02:31 don't like um baby you know what guys have we learned something here have we
01:02:36 learned that commenters actually can be decent people all right fair enough this
01:02:44 has flown in the face of everything I've ever known yeah it was it was it well
01:02:49 the funny thing about it is that like that that Isaac let's play because the
01:02:53 audio recording was so bad and it was like we recorded it at it was it was like
01:02:59 six in the morning after we just done like eight hours of other let's plays
01:03:03 that are all for Jesse's channel and we were like we didn't want to go to bed we
01:03:08 still wanted to record and Ben's like let's do Isaac I can play that you know
01:03:11 I've played a million hours of it I can play it sort of on autopilot Ben wasn't
01:03:15 as tired as me and Jesse were but we're like like you know that there's not a
01:03:20 whole lot of conversation it's sort of bad audio and so I considered like not
01:03:24 even releasing it it was like you know will anyone actually be entertained by
01:03:29 this but I'm now I'm glad I did because now we found out that the guy who
01:03:33 programmed the damn game is a fan of the show and I was like you know this just
01:03:38 goes to show everyone put out every stupid shit video that you make don't
01:03:44 don't throw anything away release it all you never know when you'll meet the guy
01:03:48 who made binding of Isaac by way of your your crappy shit videos there's no
01:03:57 escape for me relatable relatable that's why you said I'm sticking to it from now
01:04:06 on no one can stop me release it I've started a terrible downgrade of PCP
01:04:12 content everything will be terrible thing possible I don't know don't worry
01:04:17 we fit on a downward spiral quite sometimes ready for more content than
01:04:22 there are even hours in the goddamn day and all sweet we'll just turn on we'll
01:04:28 just turn on a camera in the corner somewhere and just leave it going it'll
01:04:32 just be going and going I've already made my declaration that I don't make good
01:04:36 videos anymore and I'm sticking to it it's bad videos from here on out it's the
01:04:42 only kind you're gonna see for me it's the only kind I want to make the only
01:04:46 kind videos are the worst ones what about horse shoe finale part 3 where's
01:04:52 that coming out it'll come in the fucking toilet and I'll wash it down into the
01:04:59 sewer and no I'll make it I'll make it but no one'll ever see it I'll spend a
01:05:06 year making it just so that I can upload a video of me deleting the file that'll
01:05:12 be my ultimate that'll be like my gg Allen committing suicide on stage but he
01:05:17 never got to do it cuz he died in his own shit first but if he did that would
01:05:20 be my analogy for that had he like promised he was gonna do that and then
01:05:26 did yeah he didn't make it he said he didn't make it to the promise day cuz he
01:05:30 he like shot heroin up his butt pipe or something and died first heroin in my
01:05:36 butt pipe
01:05:38 I'm with you I died in my own shit at
01:05:43 me
01:05:46 Florian I have to ask what is your favorite and least favorite PCP meme
01:05:51 that's a good question oh god not the main solution outside perspective usually
01:05:56 ignore the memes altogether I was very shocked when I talked to Nate's that he
01:06:00 was just talking purely in memes was all just cack and lol and everything
01:06:08 he knows that I'm secretly the best me did you thoughts on the undertayler any
01:06:16 uh you know upvoted down what the official PCP mascot how fucking hype

01:07:56 money it was all joke yeah it's always a dangerous joke that patreon.com slash I
01:08:02 don't have health insurance anymore help me please that's a good picture it's
01:08:08 100% true you think I fuck around with this shit insurance I don't think I've
01:08:13 ever had that once you got it once you got it you're suddenly scared of
01:08:20 everything when it's gone insurances for the birds it's for a little pussy baby
01:08:25 girl the birds well I wish I was a bird insurance insurance is like the PCP of
01:08:34 adults no one needs it and it shouldn't exist hey one I've got a real question
01:08:42 that I was wondering about Florian what would you say were your game like
01:08:48 inspirations when you were making you know all the stuff you did what are some
01:08:52 classics that you loved as a young lad yeah yeah your art what what the classics
01:08:57 that inspire your your your dev shit yeah yeah oh man I I don't even remember
01:09:05 if I had any kind of inspirations at the time of making Isaac we just kind of
01:09:10 trolling around on new grounds and just seeing what people were making and you
01:09:13 know well I was but I never really got into flash games even though I made them
01:09:18 myself I never really I can't point out one good flash game that I really like
01:09:23 except I can't point out one good flash game that is hilarious um well like what
01:09:31 I mean what would you say are some of your favorite games well I actually made
01:09:36 a top 10 list that you should watch about my favorite games but I am a PC
01:09:43 master master race master and so my my my original games not like they're not
01:09:51 Mario or anything like that's their mind sweeper I play mind sweeper and I'm
01:09:55 really good at it yeah yeah I love fucking mind sweeper yeah man so it's
01:10:00 soft that like like my current computer I guess I have a pirate in windows so it
01:10:08 didn't come with mind sweeper oh no makes me mad but I but luckily it's it's a
01:10:13 browser game now you can easily just type mind sweeper into Google and it's
01:10:16 fucking there but I've spent spent many an hour I think I've won maybe two or
01:10:21 three times those were the most glorious moments of my life I have never
01:10:26 won a sweeper and I just don't see it ever happen in for me it really boils
01:10:31 down to luck at the end because like I have difficulties where you play yeah
01:10:36 yeah I have only on like super like I set the difficulty like so if you can't
01:10:40 even lose no you got to set it to you gotta you know you play hard mode with
01:10:45 99 mines and you fucking flag them all and if you but when you get down to the
01:10:51 very end there's always gonna be a point where like there's just no way to know
01:10:56 like there's always one moment where you just can't know and you have to guess
01:10:59 are you casual mind sweepers I got a 25% win rate on expert it's very doable
01:11:06 even though sometimes it's fucked and you have to guess but it's very doable
01:11:10 25% of the time I love your inspiration is fucking mind sweeper how do you feel
01:11:16 about how do you feel about space pinball you big fan of space
01:11:21 can I get any love for jazz ball I fucking love jazz ball how about that
01:11:28 how about that a screensaver mice amaze that you'd like the mouse just goes
01:11:33 through and finds the cheese was that a big gaming inspiration I see monkeys
01:11:37 saying jazz ball is the shit you know I think monkeys mentioned jazz ball before
01:11:41 yeah mom that is you it's it's really cool look it up I got a game for you it's
01:11:47 called dark souls what about what about what about the quest for donut or
01:11:55 something there's a game oh yeah the best game of all time
01:11:59 yeah just Jesse funnily enough while maybe has not developed any indie games
01:12:04 has like three about him yeah about that and there should be more and there I
01:12:10 don't want there to ever be a to be a lull in the in the people making games
01:12:14 about me meme more sense hey you know what speaking of which games here yeah
01:12:21 just do it bro just just download make game dot exe and run that shit I got I
01:12:26 click team micro media fusion something or other too I'm gonna make a game
01:12:33 right now I'm just gonna open it up all right that's that's great oh no we're
01:12:38 gonna have a world I've earned in a game relevant to that I was I was tweeted
01:12:43 out a little while ago you know ask us questions and stuff and monkey jones
01:12:47 asked a question for you Florian a procrastinators how much do I got to pay
01:12:52 that guy for a monkey flash game so what what are your rates so what could we
01:12:55 you can't afford me I'm can't afford you seemly expensive he's got the monkey
01:13:01 money dude he's a youtuber he's making all whatever whatever monkey offers you
01:13:05 I'll double it to not make a game about him oh my god the bidding war that'll
01:13:14 never end that's fantastic incidentally episode 42 of the procrastinators
01:13:20 podcast is being published right this second oh my god and you're all
01:13:26 missing you Florian you're missing out on your favorite cast cuz you're too busy
01:13:30 being on your favorite part because I was afraid I would just stop playing
01:13:35 Dark Souls and fapping just like I would normally when I play when I listen to
01:13:39 you guys lucky to have the same time that's hard mode I usually just use
01:13:50 the controller to jack so I can use both my hands on the buttons but you do
01:13:55 do one hand each oh like like you wrap the cord around your dick and you like
01:13:59 yeah yeah it's easy it's the only kind that gets me off anymore yeah only to
01:14:09 Dark Souls yeah oh yeah there's undead naked women perfect especially when
01:14:16 it when they turn into beef after you've been hollowed yeah I'm just I'm
01:14:21 just gonna say the what is it the fuck what's that what's that roast beef
01:14:26 covered beast from Bloodborne that's just got the floppy vagina on its back
01:14:30 oh yeah I'm talking about the blood starved beast the blood starved beast is hot
01:14:34 as a beef beef the roast beef beef the DLC roasted beef oh no school you blood
01:14:43 born for not coming out on PC yeah yeah they really fucked you over with that
01:14:48 one it's awful just like the biggest meme in the world Ben yeah it's cuz Sony
01:14:53 published or help them make it or something? I don't know.
01:14:58 Okay, let's transition. We got some questions here that we can take a look at over on the
01:15:04 Twitter. Here's an important one from at Cygriz after the D. They want to know, why does Digi
01:15:12 shit naked? First of all, I didn't even know that was true. And second of all, please explain
01:15:17 Digi. Why you shit naked?
01:15:19 Well, I can think of a few good reasons. One, it feels good. Two, it feels good.
01:15:26 I mean, really, there's only the one reason.
01:15:31 The full aesthetic package is delivered. Make sense to me. Here's one that's stupid, but
01:15:37 I'm going to ask it anyway by at Yath and Cool. What do you think Western animation can learn
01:15:43 from anime and vice versa? Nothing. Run. Flee. Do not take anything from anime. It's
01:15:49 trash, my dude. Tentacle porn. Shouldn't these questions be for our guests? Oh, yes. Yes,
01:15:58 they should. Maybe you should have specified. We have a guest this week. Oh, God, it's true.
01:16:03 Nobody knows. Actually, I heard that Monkey leaked the secret info in the discord, in the
01:16:08 fan discord. Yeah. So if you were in the PCP fan discord, someone on Snapchat told me that
01:16:15 Monkey leaked it in the fan discord. So if you want to be on the ball with hot gauze.
01:16:20 That fan discord is going to be the death of us. The idea that there's some fucking
01:16:25 hive of filth and villainy where fans of us talk about us amongst themselves. Who knows
01:16:31 what they're saying? Who knows what sick things they're saying? I don't know what the fuck
01:16:34 they're saying, but I'm glad that they're saying it, whatever it is. Well, actually,
01:16:39 some people did actually ask specific questions. Well, I mean, Monkey was one, but here's a
01:16:44 real one actually for Florian by at steel viper 77 asks, Florian, what was your favorite
01:16:50 project to work on with Ed other than the binding of Isaac? I like coil. It's the sea
01:16:56 world, of course. Rainbow fills. Amazing. And everything just stays in the back. It turns
01:17:03 black and it's all just filthy fluids everywhere. What is what is coil? I'm not familiar with
01:17:08 that one. I don't know if I can go look it up. Are you gonna make him fucking explain the
01:17:13 whole game? Just fucking go to his website. Fine. Fine. Never mind. Part two in the sperm
01:17:17 trilogy. Can I just say that the that I think just as much just as much as Isaac, I think
01:17:27 your contribution to gaming history of having made the game called cunt is absolutely invaluable.
01:17:33 It's the it's it's something that I cherish the game called cunt. So I was curious. So
01:17:41 I mean, it's also known as the seaward. So was that so that could be released on various
01:17:45 platforms or just so we could be advertised? Or, you know, what was the thought process
01:17:49 there? Well, I suppose that was just the name that it would have on the on the platforms.
01:17:54 But then when you click on it, it would say cunt. So make sense. I guess it's mild censorship.
01:18:01 Sure. Time to fuck or whatever that Ed did, which is just called time fuck in the actual
01:18:07 game. It's just to get around the loopholes there. You know, hard to run advertising,
01:18:16 I imagine on a game called cunt. Well, that's right. Free flash games need all the advertisement.
01:18:23 Break in taboos is well, I know. I mean, maybe the advertising that would have been on like
01:18:29 new grounds or whatever, they might might might not be able to run ads next to a game called
01:18:34 cunt. Oh, yes. And meanwhile, they have that game where where you're the big daddy and you
01:18:39 chainsaw children. Yes. Yeah, I know, right? It's very amusing to me constantly the exceptions
01:18:45 of violence and the rejection of anything sexual or that other game that they have very other
01:18:49 animation, which is a clown who plays propeller with his dick and it plays some goofy music to it.
01:18:57 Yeah, meat spent. Excellent. Oh, no. I don't make it worse than of it.
01:19:03 Um, these questions are all garbage. And nobody's asking anything good. Do you guys watch Always
01:19:11 Sonia Philadelphia? Yes. T vice writer. Now shut the hell up and never comment again.
01:19:15 Yeah. Yeah. This is what I want to hear. This is what I want out of this guy says this guy says
01:19:26 Hey, what did you guys think about Final Fantasy 15? Fuck you. That's what I think about it.
01:19:37 You ass hole. I can't shit on my buddy at rabbits foot 99 with their incredibly cute duck icon asking
01:19:44 does dieting matter too much or is it all about exercising? Dieting super important. It's more
01:19:49 important than exercising. Do that if you want to be healthy. So there you go. There's a real question
01:19:52 for you. Great. Thanks. Oh, okay. Let's just do one more because these are all garbage. I got a
01:20:00 question. I got a question. Oh, okay. What is your favorite videos from all of us? Oh, put them on
01:20:07 the spot. Put them on the spot. It's definitely gonna be horseshoe finale. I've just watched that
01:20:13 again recently and it's just always so weird. So it's amazing. I have to fucking ask, does that
01:20:19 mean that you have watched the horseshoe saga that led up to it? No, not all of it, but I have
01:20:26 a red track. Well, I suppose actually, I guess so, but I've watched the finale first. And now
01:20:31 it's also tragic in its beauty because now it means that all of you guys have stopped making
01:20:37 pony reviews. And now who will explain my little pony to me? Who will do it? There's no one left.
01:20:43 There's a lot of costs now. There's none. There's only a pale limitation. You know, after horseshoe
01:20:48 finale, they stopped trying. That's when the show went downhill because they knew. The inspired
01:20:56 art had surpassed the original creation. So it was time to shut down shop. That was always the case.
01:21:03 There was that one cartoon Max Gilardi did and that was amazing. The Dotmove series, yeah.
01:21:09 That's the one. There was the friendship is Witchcraft, which was better than the original
01:21:16 show by Miles. There was this one channel called I love Kim Possible a lot and you'd think that it
01:21:22 was a Kim Possible channel, but it was actually a my little pony channel and it was the most
01:21:28 hard hitting in-depth fucking out of control underground. No holds barred. No fucking mainstream
01:21:35 bullshit. It was real analysis for real fucking bronies. Let me tell you. If you wanted to know
01:21:42 what the fuck was up. That was your hub. That was your hub, not the hub. One of the, you know,
01:21:48 probably the chief influence on drowning in horseshoes was the legendary I love Kim Possible
01:21:55 a lot. Any fucking ways. I think Hippo was asking for your favorite video by each of us.
01:22:05 And don't be afraid to hurt our feelings if you don't know any of us.
01:22:11 Yeah, I'm not gonna be upset if you don't know which one of mine you like.
01:22:16 I know about you. I'm just curious.
01:22:19 I've seen-
01:22:20 Just what Hippo wants to know is what's your favorite video of his? Just answer that question.
01:22:24 There's a fish at the door. There's a fish at the door. It's amazing.
01:22:32 Oh, fantastic. I'm glad you know about fish.
01:22:35 That water. I've seen that a while ago before I even saw the rest of his channel. So yeah,
01:22:41 that was cool. Great. By the way, is that on the Gibbentech channel or is that on Hippocrates?
01:22:49 A quick question about that, about the lore of fish at the door. Did that man go on? Was that a
01:22:53 business that he started selling water to these fish? Do they pay? Is this a, you know, like a-
01:22:59 Yeah, he's started a bar. He made, you know, he made the best of a bad situation. All these
01:23:05 immigrants coming over. Immigrants. From the ocean. Right. He got like all this tap water. He's like,
01:23:11 I can supply these fish what they want. I know. I agree with you and it'd be if Hippo was like,
01:23:16 yeah, it's all a metaphor for immigration. I have a very right-wing policy about these things.
01:23:21 Well, actually, that's a very left-wing policy about accepting them. This is actually a pro-Trump
01:23:26 propaganda piece. Finally, I was waiting for an excuse to talk about Donald Trump, the best guy
01:23:34 who's also I hate him, but I can't decide today. Every day is different. Every day. I've trolled
01:23:42 so much about Donald Trump. I don't even know where I stand anymore. I've trolled myself into a
01:23:47 quarter with Donald Trump. Help!
01:23:51 Nate, what was the last question you wanted to read?
01:23:53 Okay. Yeah, here's one. Oh, fuck, I lost it. What's your favorite bird? What's your favorite bird?
01:24:04 My, uh, my, at Simon. At Simon asked, what's your favorite type of bird?
01:24:09 Oh, that is hard. It's both of such majestic creatures. And they're also beautiful.
01:24:15 Ravens and crows are cool as shit. They're cool as shit. And they could be your friends.
01:24:19 Yes. Every possible topic has a Jesse meme. It's true. I got an actual answer.
01:24:27 The wood duck. The wood duck. Why, man? Why? If you get made of wood. Google, Google wood duck,
01:24:34 and you will see the majesty that is the wood duck. And it's beautiful plumage.
01:24:39 Oh, it's got nice stripes all over it. It's all colorful and iridescent and shit.
01:24:45 I love it. Pretty good. That's a good ass duck. That's pretty good, right? Yeah, for sure.
01:24:48 Loving that wood duck. Living a wood duck life. My favorite kind of bird is a Pidgeotto.
01:24:55 Oh, no, no. My favorite bird type Pokemon is missing. No, because it's the only bird type Pokemon.
01:25:01 Yeah, that's true. Oh, I see. It's glitch type bird type. You got outclassed, motherfucker. God damn.
01:25:08 Well, well, you know, Pidgeotto's been a, you know, even though I'm sick of seeing his ass,
01:25:13 he's been a very helpful companion in many a Pokemon game over the years. I can't say there's
01:25:18 any other bird I've spent more time with. My favorite bird is Big Bird. Yeah.
01:25:26 Because he's the fucking biggest. Nobody's as big as Big Bird. God damn it. I'll fight a nigger.
01:25:34 I'll fight anyone who says he's bigger than Big Bird. I like Dynablade from Kirby Superstar.
01:25:42 He's strong. He's a good mom. He loves his family. You know, got strong Christian values. You know,
01:25:49 there's a lot to love about the man woman. No, the best bird from Kirby is definitely Heavy Lobster.
01:25:58 I do like Heavy Lobster. Heavy Lobster is a good bird. What I'm trying to say is I love
01:26:02 Meta Knight's Revenge. It's the greatest Kirby game of all time and Dynablade helps you and that's
01:26:07 nice and Kirby is an evil man. But I love that game. 10 out of 10. Meta Knight's Revenge. There
01:26:13 you go. Best Kirby game. Dynablade just is fucking Songbird from Infinite before it was cool.
01:26:20 Yeah. Only you never fight Songbird. So whatever. I think my favorite bird will be a Cassivore
01:26:27 because it's so deadly and beautiful. Ooh, I'm gonna Google that. It's pretty much an emo with a
01:26:32 spike at its foot, I think. Unless I misremember the name. Oh, it's all blue. I think so, yeah.
01:26:38 That's a good bird. How do you spell that? I can't do it. That bird is like half Buffalo.
01:26:45 Link me your search result, dude. I'm too lazy to Google it myself. I couldn't find it. I am
01:26:51 leaned back in my chair and I cannot be asked to lean forward. Ben, please. If you'll, if you'll
01:26:58 please post the link. God's sake. I don't know how to spell this thing. Yes, right away. Right away, sir.
01:27:10 Okay, there we go. All right. Now, that looks like that's a dinosaur is what that is. That's just
01:27:14 a straight dinosaur. Yep. Dinosaur bird. Goddamn. I'd like to fuck that board. It is beefy.
01:27:23 It looks delicious. It's glorious. It does look delicious. Got a lot of meat on them,
01:27:27 non bones or hollow bones. Oh, oh. Oh, no. What's that other super delicious bird? Chicken.
01:27:36 They're also delicious. Yeah, yeah. No, no, there's another bird. The most delicious bird.
01:27:44 No, it's green and it's weird. I like green food. Green eggs and ham. Everyone type in green bird
01:27:53 on Google. We'll find it. Green. Oh, we'll find Kawabiba. Oh, it's Polly. You know what? My favorite
01:27:59 green bird. Cacopos. The cacopo is the most delicious bird. Is that a cacophony in its
01:28:04 unevolved form? It's a caca. I just think it's Pokemons. It's all Pokemons. I'm sorry. I totally
01:28:12 cut you off, Hippo. But I was just talking about the penguin being my favorite because he's got
01:28:18 green, green screen skin. He does. Oh, the penguin. Your penguin, right? The Hippo penguin.
01:28:27 How could I forget? The soon to be a real character penguin boy. When are we seeing more of that
01:28:32 young man? The reference literally no one will get penguin boy. I get this. When's he coming back,
01:28:38 Gib? When's he coming back? Well, I mean, there's a club penguin news. Oh, yes. Oh, that's exciting.
01:28:47 Oh, my God. He needs to avenge his people who are all being fucking executed at the end of
01:28:51 March. Oh, my God. That's very exciting. That's very exciting. Okay, we're done. We're out of
01:28:57 steam, right? We're done here. Oh, no. Wait, I'm trying to take a picture of the game that I'm
01:29:03 developing right now. I'm trying to take a screenshot. It's better be the best damn game I
01:29:12 ever seen or I swear to God, I want my money back. Yeah, print screen, print screen. Well,
01:29:17 I'll do it after the podcast. I'll show you. No, I do it now. I want to see it. All right.
01:29:25 Oh, shit. I got to open up Photoshop. Just fucking screencap. Why? Just the screen cap
01:29:32 software doesn't do it. I'm going to teach you something incredibly valuable right now.
01:29:36 Press the print screen button on your keyboard. Let me teach everyone the most important thing
01:29:40 you'll ever learn about your computer if you use Windows. Go into your start menu and in the search
01:29:45 bar type snip and snipping tool will pop up, which instantly is a thing that lets you capture an
01:29:52 area of your screen. It automatically converts it into an image that you can just control v-paste
01:29:57 anywhere and use that for the rest of your life because it's the most valuable thing in the world.
01:30:02 Okay, so use that. Yeah, print screen will do. Yeah, do it or do it. I have it already.
01:30:10 It's Super Mario Hippo. Number one hippo in gaming. You made all this art during this podcast
01:30:17 and made a fully functional game with nothing in it. I love it. I love it. That's an incredible
01:30:22 amount that you've done in this short span of time since announcing that you were going to do it.
01:30:26 Oh my God, Gippo. You know, you need to get later in this game. You need to upgrade your
01:30:31 propeller hat so you can just fly all the time. That's exactly what I was thinking. Yeah, he's
01:30:36 basically Rayman. I can't wait for that. Okay, so good that everyone was cutting off Hippo so he
01:30:44 could have had time to make all this perfect. That is great. He's utilized his disability for
01:30:51 good at long last. It's wonderful. My crippling disability. Oh no. Okay, well that's it. By the
01:30:57 way, I just wanted to let you know that right before we did this podcast, my heads had broken
01:31:03 the most ridiculous way and I'm not sure if you've been able to hear it, but something on the inside
01:31:07 of my head that's broken off and now it sounds like a rattle whenever I shake my head. Listen to this.
01:31:15 I hear a little bit. It's driving me insane. A little crunchy sound. I hope it wasn't too noisy.
01:31:21 I can hear it until now. But now I'm going to go back and listen for it. It's like an Easter egg.
01:31:27 Now you can listen to this podcast at home, viewers, and the second viewing will be more
01:31:35 rich for the experience. Replay value. That's what it's all about. Yeah, replay value. Well, you
01:31:41 know, like, what's it called? Fucking Discord has really good, like, it only picks up audio if it's
01:31:49 above a certain level, but Audacity doesn't have that. So there's a good chance our audience will
01:31:54 hear a lot more than we did. Quite possible. But I can't be that bad. Well, I tried to hold
01:32:01 still for you. We appreciate it. We appreciate it. Well, that was another episode of the Pro
01:32:09 Crastinators. We sure are a good bunch of friends or something. We sure are a bunch of guys. We
01:32:16 did talk to another guy. We, um, yeah. Oh, boy. Yeah. Cute a song. Now. Yeah. Everybody say goodbye.
01:32:34 Yeah.
01:32:47 I'm not working. I'm doing nothing. My dick. I'm jerking myself. I'm sucking. I am an asshole.
01:33:00 I am stupid. I've got a deadline. Don't want to do it.
01:33:08 What the hell is wrong with me?
01:33:38 What they came for instead, I'm tweeting. That's why there's no
01:33:47 heat and holes in the ceiling. Yeah, it's quite the burden. It's a hard knock life being a genius.
