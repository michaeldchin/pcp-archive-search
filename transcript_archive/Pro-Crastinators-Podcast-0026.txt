00:00:00 Hello everybody and welcome to a Pro Crastinators Podcast. Nate's not with us this week for the
00:00:06 first time, but that's okay because we've got a special guest, friend of the show, Mr. Black
00:00:10 and Platinum himself, Nino. Hey, fuck all your, fuck all your favorites. We're SJWing the fucker
00:00:17 of the PCP. You people had too many white people, not enough PLC representatives. I've come here
00:00:24 to black up everything with my negronus, also the fact that I'm with my negronus. Yes, expect
00:00:33 this podcast to become 30% more urban and hip. You know, the demographics want more hip. We're
00:00:38 all just going to start rapping right in the middle of this one. We're all just going to start rapping.
00:00:41 Yeah. All right. Yeah, it's true. Me and Tom are the only true white people here. We don't rap.
00:00:54 I'm Digi Bro and I've also got with me Ben Saint of Patreon. Ben Saint of Patreon.com
00:01:02 and Tommy Oliver. Tommy Oliver was originally in this podcast, but his audio file got corrupted
00:01:08 and therefore I had to try to edit him out of it entirely. So if at any point it seems like the
00:01:13 conversation jumps around really strangely, that's because I was editing around Tom. Sorry if it's
00:01:19 weird. I forgot to plug my channel. Okay, guys, you can follow me at Anime Editorial Nino,
00:01:26 you know, N-I-N-O-U-H. Go watch my YouTube video. I'm not just a rapper and a black person. I actually
00:01:31 do stuff on YouTube. Yeah. They wouldn't have brought me on for any other reason. They brought
00:01:37 me on because they knew me and they knew that I did YouTube stuff. All right, thank you. No,
00:01:40 we needed someone to do a halftime show in the middle of the podcast. So today's topic, which
00:01:46 Nino suggested. Second topic I've suggested, by the way. Yeah, you suggested last week's,
00:01:52 or the one that was released last week. Yeah. This topic is, you introduce it.
00:02:00 Well, basically, the topic is our internet origin story. The story of how everyone on this podcast
00:02:08 or the people who are currently doing the podcast became familiar with the internet because if,
00:02:14 you know, everyone, if you're watching this, obviously, you know how to use the fucking
00:02:18 internet. Everyone has their own really intimate and personal way they use it. For example, let
00:02:24 me take you through how I wake up in the morning. Like, I'll get, I'll talk about how I've got to
00:02:27 this point, but I'll take you through how I wake up in the morning and use the internet. When I
00:02:31 wake up, I usually close out the tabs of N-Hentai I used the night before. I open up a new tab of
00:02:39 to check out all of the stuff, you know, to check out all the gaming news that is or isn't happening.
00:02:45 I go on 4chan, probably look at a few shitposts. I go on Twitter to see if anyone's been calling
00:02:51 me out today. And then I go into my discord and I start talking shit with all my friends.
00:02:55 That's how, that's how I use the internet right now. And everyone else has that you,
00:03:00 watching this, you have your own, the life of a troll. It's like some life story.
00:03:06 We've all got our, we've all got our own little internet fingerprint. We've all got a little,
00:03:11 a little internet snowflake, a little fractal spiral, spiral, you know, life, life pattern
00:03:17 of internet usage. Yeah. And basically, and basically the point of this podcast is now I've
00:03:23 shown, I've talked a little bit about where I am with how I use the internet. And this podcast
00:03:27 is how everybody got, got to where they are, how we got to this point, how we learned to torrent
00:03:32 stuff, how we learned to, how we learned to watch and watch anime online and stuff. Everybody
00:03:37 has a really interesting story. And I feel like everybody has a really cool way to express it.
00:03:41 So who wants to go first? Oh man. I feel like everybody, I feel like everybody on this podcast
00:03:47 has new grounds in their story at some point. No, not me. You'll be surprised. I definitely was,
00:03:53 I definitely was on new grounds for a while. I avoided new grounds like the plague because
00:03:59 as I understood it, that was the place where there were dicks. Oh boy. Like literal dicks.
00:04:06 For me growing up, I was like, all the seedy side of the internet, like I was afraid of.
00:04:12 Oh, you want to know, you want to know none of that. You want it to be all pure and just...
00:04:16 Well, I grew up, I grew up pretty sheltered from like both like violence and sex stuff. Like,
00:04:22 not out of my parents like actively sheltering me, but it was more like they kind of like,
00:04:27 I was very like, if my parents told me something was bad, my instinct was not to then seek it out.
00:04:33 It was to go, oh, it's bad. Okay. And then not look at it, you know. It's like, I'd never looked at
00:04:38 like stuff that my parents kind of said like, oh, this isn't for you. This is for adults. And I'm
00:04:42 like, oh, well, I'm not an adult. I'm a kid. I'm not going to look at that. I mean, I discovered
00:04:48 4chan and new grounds specifically because people told me they were terrible places full of terrible
00:04:53 things, which made me go seek after them. Yeah, I avoided them forever. I've only been on new grounds
00:05:00 like two or three times just to look at like Egoraptor's profile when I became a fan of him later.
00:05:07 You got some, there are some great, there are some legitimately great flash games on there. There
00:05:12 are a couple of real masters. Oh, you know what? I played Endeavor. Oh, I fucking love Endeavor,
00:05:16 dude. Holy shit. I fucking love Endeavor. Oh my god, I can't believe somebody else knows Endeavor.
00:05:21 Ben, we've talked about it before. I can't remember any of the names of them. I can't remember
00:05:29 any of the actual names of the games, but I played pretty much every possible side-scrolling action
00:05:35 game and every possible dating sim that new grounds had to offer, every single one of them,
00:05:42 all of them. I'm younger than all of you guys, so I found it particularly early when I was like
00:05:48 seven years old, but I'll get to my story. Tom, continue yours. Well, yeah, I want to know, Tom,
00:05:52 how did you find new grounds to end up with your... No, Jack's blade is a huge digi. Digi is a... Well,
00:06:00 no. Oh, no, no, no, no. A barometer. Are you going to say I'm a nigg whisperer? Exactly. I was about
00:06:06 to say, no, no, no. What I was about to say was, if you want to know what black people like,
00:06:11 measure up to what Digi likes to a certain degree, because he has so many nigger tendencies for a
00:06:17 white person, it's not even funny. I have, through talking to Digi, the nigger tendencies I've picked
00:06:24 up in him, he's one of the only people in the anime community next to Lou from Lou Talks Anime
00:06:29 that I can just talk to about hip hop for hours. We're just talking yesterday about a bunch of
00:06:34 rappers. Who's the one you recommended, Cakes to Kill Out? Yeah, we're just talking about a bunch
00:06:39 of rappers yesterday. I was telling him how YG is the bad end of Good Kid Mad City and Kendrick
00:06:45 is the true end. You know, but I feel like Lou is into like, white people rap music though,
00:06:52 because every time he recommends me something, it's always like a rap rock song, and I'm always like,
00:06:59 He's a fan of a lot of old school battle rap as well, so he is part of that scene as well.
00:07:04 I don't want to get too much into the rap stuff, so I'll get back to your internet story.
00:07:09 I gotta say, I only have a brief story for that period, because I also had Dial Up up until
00:07:14 2006, but I just didn't really know about internet video or downloading until around the time that
00:07:21 I got broadband or whatever. The only internet video I remember having that experience with,
00:07:27 of loading it all day, was AMV Hell 3, which is an hour-long AMV thing that I'm sure you've all
00:07:36 probably seen parts of at least. It was really big in the early 2000s, and back then the AMV
00:07:42 community was mostly file sharing stuff. People would make AMVs and then torrent them back and
00:07:47 forth, or whatever the old peer-to-peer them, or whatever. I guess that's what torrenting is?
00:07:52 Yeah, like Lime Wire. And so that's how AMVs were before YouTube, and then there was these AMV
00:08:00 Hell compilations, and AMV Hell 3 was this giant, epic, collaborative effort between all these
00:08:05 different people. It was an hour-long, and I don't remember what streaming host it used,
00:08:10 but it was available for streaming online, and I've watched it, and it would be like
00:08:15 me and Victor would watch it, and we watched it multiple times this way, and it would just be
00:08:19 this all-night endeavor, because you could load enough. Each joke was about 30 seconds long,
00:08:26 so you could basically pause the video and sit there for two or three minutes, and then maybe
00:08:31 play a little bit of that joke, and it would be just enough that you could get a laugh and then
00:08:36 wait some more, and it was literally all night. It would take to watch AMV Hell 3,
00:08:41 but it was so fucking good that we've fucking dealt with it.
00:08:45 I remember lying in bed on the weekends and waiting until I thought that my parents would be
00:08:52 asleep, so I could sneak downstairs and turn on my fucking dial-up internet and let the connect
00:08:58 the internet and hope that the fucking loudass beat it, didn't wake up my parents so that I could
00:09:05 get on the internet and jack it to pornography. That's my internet story.
00:09:11 Okay, the thing is with the whole issue of internet speed, because time progresses and
00:09:17 technology gets better, so internet speed is definitely a part of all of our internet stories,
00:09:22 but I feel like I've been uniquely affected by speed, because unlike basically everyone in
00:09:28 this cast, I didn't grow up in a first world country. I grew up in a mixture between Ghana,
00:09:34 Nigeria, and Togo, as well as the UK. I grew up in the UK to a certain amount of time.
00:09:40 The worst country of the world.
00:09:45 As well as the UK. I was born in the UK, I grew up there, and then I moved when I was very young
00:09:50 to Ghana, and I stayed there until, so basically my first experience with the internet was when
00:09:57 I was still living in the UK, and my dad would always say, Jimmy, we're going to the office,
00:10:02 because he didn't want to leave me at home, and my mom was also at work, both my parents used to
00:10:05 work, and my dad would say, we're going to the office, and I would hate going with him to the
00:10:09 office, because it's like all they have there are computers, and when I was a kid, computers,
00:10:14 don't suck! Who cares about computers? I want to sit at home and watch Dragon Ball Z, so he would
00:10:21 drag me over. I'm picturing you in that don't hug me, I'm scared when the computer comes to
00:10:27 teach you about the wonders of the internet. Yeah, who cares about computers? I went there,
00:10:34 and I sat down at my dad's desk, because he would never actually use his desk while I was there,
00:10:40 he would always be in a meeting or something, because whenever he would bring me, he would
00:10:45 always know that the only thing I would have to do was be on a computer, so all I knew how to do
00:10:50 at one point was play pinball on Windows 98, so I was just playing pinball all the time, then one
00:10:55 of my dad's employees came and said, oh Jimmy, let me teach you about this thing called the internet,
00:11:02 and I was just like selling drugs to children. Exactly, selling drugs to children. Let me teach
00:11:10 you about it, because this was, I think, 1999, 2000, I was like five, around there, five or six,
00:11:18 I was really little, so he then put on, I don't remember where it was, but he just put on the
00:11:25 website for, he was like, tell me what TV shows you like, and I was like, okay, I like, you know,
00:11:30 I think I said Sailor Moon or something, so he pulled up the website. And he shook his head
00:11:36 sadly and turned back to the computer. Yeah, exactly, oh no, but like, he asked me also,
00:11:43 how do you spell that, so he looked it up, and then pulled up the website for Sailor Moon, and he
00:11:46 was like, you can look at pictures of all the best shows you like, and I was just like, you know
00:11:50 what, this is something to do, I get to look at pictures of TV shows I like, so the internet,
00:11:54 the internet hadn't been sold on me yet, and it was not until like, a little bit later, about a
00:12:00 few years later, then one of my dad's younger employees, this guy was, I think, at the time,
00:12:06 I think it was like, 20, so he was, so this guy's an early adult, he's probably got an
00:12:15 anime blog, and we're probably all fans of it, so like, this guy, he comes like, Jimmy, let me
00:12:23 teach you about this site called Newgrounds, and that's what the doors got, that's what the doors
00:12:27 got blown over. Dude, you had some sick, sick ass adults in your life, dude. Yeah, like, oh man,
00:12:34 like. Yeah, you're the only person I've talked to who didn't learn about Newgrounds from like,
00:12:38 someone in middle school. No, no, no, adults taught me about Newgrounds, man, I was out,
00:12:43 no one in my school knew about the internet. I think the average person finds out about Newgrounds
00:12:49 some fat obnoxious white kid in your middle school, so he thinks he's really funny by repeating
00:12:54 everything you see in comics. By repeating all of those shit, but all the fucking lines from
00:12:59 Homestar Runner and all that shit, fuck man. Yeah, well someone who's gonna come up to you and describe
00:13:04 every Newgrounds video they watch, you know, and then Dick came out of the cereal box.
00:13:13 I remember, like he says, Jimmy, I know you like the Mega Man games, let me show you this one game,
00:13:16 and I remember the first game I ever played on Newgrounds, it was this, like, weird time attack
00:13:22 side-scrolling Mega Man game called Zero Race, where you controlled zero from the Mega Man X games
00:13:27 and you just had to complete time challenges, and I would play that, like, I would play that game
00:13:32 diligently for hours. So now, instead of, like, Jimmy, let's go to the office, it would be,
00:13:37 dad, let's go to the office, so I could go and play, I could go and play, like, you know,
00:13:42 whatever. And then I remember I started finding the other stuff on Newgrounds, and I know you've
00:13:49 completely co-opted Tom's fucking time to tell his story. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Tom, Tom, you can,
00:13:56 you can finish, I'll get back, I'll get back to the other stuff on Newgrounds when you're done.
00:14:00 Oh man, Shaw Shaw's part, man too, Shaw Shaw, man, I can't tell you how many fucking, like,
00:14:05 stick figure, like, stick figure stories. Oh wait, I know what you're talking about. Yeah.
00:14:10 Yeah, the super violent stick figure cartoons, right, and they don't always be sent to fucking,
00:14:14 to new metal songs. Holy shit, that takes me back. Oh my god, I watched a ton of those, because,
00:14:22 see, the era, like, my cousin, I had an older cousin, my cousin Boyd, who's like four years older
00:14:27 than me, and he knew a lot more of those, like, you know, flash cartoon sites and stuff like that,
00:14:32 like, the stuff that I avoided, because it was, like, too adult and stuff, but he would show me
00:14:36 tons of those violent stick figure cartoons, which are a fucking blast, because it's just,
00:14:40 it'll always just be, like, some extremely long, violent fight scene. God, what was the one where
00:14:45 it was like, the character was supposed to be, like, a beast? He had, like, Wolverine claws,
00:14:50 and it was like, some, like, they created some, like, genetic monster in a, in a lab, and each
00:14:55 episode of the show would be, like, some scenario where he ends up around all these people, and
00:14:59 it'll start playing a disturbed song, and he'll murder everyone, or, like, a slipknot song, and
00:15:03 this guy'll just fucking kill all these people, and it was so cool. Sounds pretty cool. My, my, my,
00:15:10 my favorite, my favorite was for the Shao Shao series, and the Shao Shao series is this, like,
00:15:15 long-winded, I think, at the time, when I stopped watching it, it got up to, like, eight or nine
00:15:20 parts, and the first one was so simple, it was just two stick figures fighting each other, right,
00:15:26 and they just had this really well-choreographed battle together, and then it just kept getting
00:15:31 progressively more and more crazy, where one of the most iconic ones is, like, their levels to,
00:15:36 like, a building, and this one stick figure goes through all, like, five levels of this building,
00:15:40 and murders, brutally murders hundreds of these stick figure guys in such, like, grandiose fashion,
00:15:47 and it was so crazy to see. It's such a thing, it's all detailed, right? Like, every punch and kick
00:15:51 is, like, is, like, unique and stuff, where it just, like, goes through this whole big scenario.
00:15:56 Did you guys have the same reaction to those that I did, which is to then draw
00:16:01 fuckloads of stick figure fight scenes? Yes, yes. Because I, I did a lot of, uh, flip books, like,
00:16:07 I would just take, I would draw, like, just on the bottom corner of the page of a book,
00:16:12 like, a bunch of stick figure fights, and just, and, yeah, I always wanted it to be like that,
00:16:16 where it was, like, every attack was unique, and the characters would do all these crazy moves and
00:16:21 shit. I drew lots and lots of, like, action stick figure comics in, uh, early 2000s. Because I feel
00:16:27 like that's part, like, because, aside from the internet, like, and aside from Sha Sha, when I was
00:16:31 growing up, my cousins were all, like, super, they were my cousins, a lot of my cousins were Otaku,
00:16:36 and a lot of my cousins were also really big kung fu movie nerds, and they would bring all of these,
00:16:41 and not just, like, the Jackie Chan Bruce Lee ones, they would bring all of these really obscure,
00:16:45 like, tapes from China, in the original Chinese with no subtitles, and would just sit and watch
00:16:50 for hours, just these absolutely insane, like, I remember we, one of my cousins had the flying
00:16:56 guillotine, and I was just like, this guy throws this thing, like, yeah, like, he, he, he, those
00:17:03 movies were great, so like, this guy throws the thing, and you just, and the, all of these fight
00:17:07 scenes were absolutely fucking great, so I feel like when I started seeing that, that kind of stuff,
00:17:12 that was obviously inspired by all of these, like, kung fu movies from China, like, in the form of all
00:17:18 these stick figure fights, that was one of my eight, my entryways into just being like, this is
00:17:22 fucking awesome, and that probably was also what later led me to being anime is fucking awesome,
00:17:27 but that's, that's, that's later on in the story, we won't get there yet. Tom, continue with yours.
00:17:32 Oh man, Lime Wire is, all of these things are flooding back, like, Lime Wire is another, like,
00:17:38 I feel like everybody's internet story, because of just how the internet evolves, and how it evolved
00:17:44 everybody has these topstones that just, like, everybody who was around in the,
00:17:49 like, I think for all of us, we've all been on the internet since the mid-2000s, and I know even
00:17:54 though you're younger than the rest of us, you started so young, whereas I think that, like,
00:17:59 for a lot of people your age who didn't get into it until like the 2010s, probably don't know what
00:18:04 any of this shit we're talking about. Well, yeah, a lot of my friends probably didn't get, don't
00:18:09 know what Lime Wire is, but man, shit, like, well, I want, I want to continue with mine,
00:18:14 but only after Tom's finished his, like, because I have a few things to say.
00:18:18 Not to co-opt, but I gotta say, this, I can, I think I remember that I, I, I,
00:18:23 Lime Wired the Fooly Cooly soundtrack. Everybody did.
00:18:27 I needed that. I bought the, I, I own the Fooly Cooly soundtrack.
00:18:30 Everybody Lime Wired the Fooly Cooly, I, I Lime Wired.
00:18:33 I painted it at a store and bought it. I remember Lime Wiring, like, pretty much
00:18:38 every single, every single song that, every single, like, different version of Charla
00:18:44 Hedjala that was ever done. Like, this was way back in the day, because I, I looked up
00:18:49 Charla Hedjala, because I, I, I grew up with the, with the English dub, and then I heard
00:18:53 the Japanese theme song. I was like, I love this song. Let me get on Lime Wire. And like,
00:18:57 18 different versions popped up. And I was like, let me get them all. And I was just like,
00:19:01 yeah, I just downloaded every single one.
00:19:03 Well, I got to talk about Lime Wire. Mine's different, because once again, I, I grew up
00:19:10 more sheltered. And I was familiar with Lime Wire from like, 2001, because my mom got into
00:19:17 the internet at around the same time I did. And she was a huge System of a Down fan.
00:19:22 Like, she was obsessed with that band. And she would like hang out in their forums and stuff.
00:19:26 And so she found out about Lime Wire as a way to download, like, System of a Down had
00:19:31 shit tons of unreleased music that was online, like all these demos and, and B-sides and shit.
00:19:38 And eventually they made, like they released an album called Steal This Album, which was just a
00:19:43 collection of like music that people kept stealing off of Lime Wire. And they were just like,
00:19:47 fucking here it is on a CD. But um, so we had, like my mom would download all the System of a Down
00:19:53 music. And some of it wasn't even them. Some of it would be like guest spots of them or just bands
00:19:57 that sounded a lot like System of a Down and people mislabeled it and stuff. Like the most famous one...
00:20:05 Yeah. Right. And the, the one that was the most famous is like, uh, A Legend of Zelda?
00:20:12 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's, it's, it sounds like, it sounds a bit like Surge from System of a Down
00:20:18 singing this album. I was, I was convinced, I was convinced that it was him. But we had that on our,
00:20:23 our CDs. So she had all these burn CDs and System of a Down songs. But like,
00:20:26 I didn't know how to use Lime Wire myself. And I know my dad had been downloading like,
00:20:30 porn on there and shit. But uh... Oh, let me talk about porn on Lime Wire, man. Because I remember...
00:20:36 We'll get to it. But so what would ruin this forever for me though? And like, because again,
00:20:40 I never used it myself. But when I was like, uh, I want to say 12 or 13, I think 13,
00:20:47 my mom bought me a computer for my birthday. So I had my own computer. And that's another,
00:20:53 that's another important touchstone when each of us got our own personal computer.
00:20:57 Yeah. Well, here's the thing. It was ruined immediately because I got my own computer and
00:21:01 all I used it for was like, message boards, just like using the internet, you know, I didn't know
00:21:05 any other purpose for it and listening to music on there. But my cousin Boyd, the one I mentioned
00:21:11 before, he started downloading tons of shit on Lime Wire on my computer. He would come over to my
00:21:17 computer and download all this shit. So within like six months of me owning this computer, it became
00:21:23 just destroyed with viruses. Like you could not load up anything. It was practically useless.
00:21:29 So I couldn't even get online with it anymore. And we didn't know how to fix it. And I didn't
00:21:34 know how to communicate to my parents what the problem was, you know, so basically that computer
00:21:40 was good for about six months. And then it was never usable for anything but listening to music
00:21:44 again. And like writing, I would use it to write like poetry and listen to music. That was it.
00:21:50 Oh, oh my god. Oh my fucking god. Let me just let me just rant about that for two goddamn seconds.
00:21:58 Yeah, like when I was even when I up until maybe like two or three years ago, because like, you know,
00:22:04 since I graduated college, I've sort of been in and out of living at my parents house. Like I live
00:22:08 there for six months and then go away for six months and come back for a year or whatever and
00:22:11 go away for a year. Yeah, my dad was the same thing. He had the Wi-Fi on a timer so that it
00:22:17 would automatically go off after like midnight or something. And I was because I don't know,
00:22:22 he just didn't believe in me staying up past like midnight or whatever. He wanted to enforce
00:22:28 like a strict schedule. To this day, to this day, to this day, I'm not allowed to take my laptop to
00:22:32 my bedroom in my house that I can't live in. Oh my god, dude. In the house that I can't like,
00:22:36 that's the reason why I have to go downstairs to the basement to record because I can't take up to
00:22:41 my bedroom because they say, oh, you'll never come out your room and you'll never talk to anybody.
00:22:45 And it's like, well, okay. And like, oh, but you, and also if you take it to your room,
00:22:50 we don't know what time you'll sleep. All right then. But they still allow me to stay,
00:22:53 they still allow me to stay in the fucking computer room and be up until like 3 a.m.
00:22:58 So it doesn't even matter what time I sleep. And I have my phone in my room. So it's the same
00:23:02 exact thing. It's, but yeah, I understand. I understand technology. I mean, because like,
00:23:10 okay, should I pick up where I left off of mine now? Or if you want, sure. Yeah. So like, as I said,
00:23:19 at that point, I was on Newgrounds and I started finding the other stuff on Newgrounds and everybody
00:23:24 knows what the other stuff is. Dayton Sims and Hentai. Fun fact, I learned about Hentai before
00:23:29 I learned about what anime was. Like I had been watching anime, but I didn't necessarily know
00:23:34 like a term or like a what to call it or anything. But I learned what Hentai was in detail and understood
00:23:41 all the ins and outs of it long before I actually learned what anime was. So I was looking through
00:23:47 all of these like, you know, different things like just dating Sims as well as just game games that
00:23:56 I don't know how anyone could play fucking dating Sims on Newgrounds. It was it was it was again,
00:24:04 again, you have to understand, I was like seven or eight. I was a kid. I'd know I'd like free time
00:24:09 out the wazoo at free time. I was just following whatever I could want to do. So I started looking
00:24:16 at all this and it really just brought my mind really open really early. And it kind of made me
00:24:24 it kind of made me an outcast in school because I didn't because like I knew I wasn't supposed to
00:24:28 talk about it. I knew I wasn't supposed to actually like be interacting with other people about what
00:24:32 I'd been seeing on this weird internet site. So I kind of didn't have anything in common with the
00:24:37 kids with the other kids, even though like I wanted to it was it was it was you were like always
00:24:46 for a certain time, I really was always on you. But the crazy thing is I never went to the forums
00:24:51 here's another thing. I never had any internet exclusive friends up until about four years ago.
00:24:58 Like for my entire life, I never met anyone on the internet because I even though I was so free
00:25:03 to I was so willing to do whatever I wanted, I will the mind the mindset was don't make friends
00:25:08 with people on the internet because you'll get in trouble with your parents or they'll find like
00:25:13 it was it was the thing with that you said like except the only thing that took was don't don't
00:25:18 don't talk to people over the internet. Don't talk to strangers on the internet.
00:25:20 That's the that's the one thing that kind of stuck with me up until recently.
00:25:25 But yeah, so like the idea that then then came like when I grew a little bit older and I started
00:25:32 learning a lot more and then I start because the thing about what I used the internet for was games.
00:25:36 I played a lot of games on the internet. I was always looking for I was on mini clip all the time.
00:25:41 I was on new grounds playing all the new you see that new you know who just did a fucking review.
00:25:46 Oh yeah, I saw that was a trip. I was a trip. I looked at him. He posted a new review. That was
00:25:53 a trip when he was going through like that was I was seeing my life flash before my eyes as he
00:25:57 was doing that. So like I never even heard of mini clip before. Before you could see me. I want to
00:26:04 like because again, a lot of our viewers listeners might be younger and might not have lived through
00:26:09 this part of the history because what really is fascinating like I think the biggest change between
00:26:14 like 10 years ago and now is that 10 years ago you were always told do not put any personal
00:26:20 information. Yes, that is so true. Don't give out your name. So that's how that's why all of us
00:26:26 about anything. That's the reason why all of us have crazy weird names. That's the reason right
00:26:30 and I was actually about to get into that. That's how user user names are. Are you not still supposed
00:26:37 to put personal I don't think it's true anymore because I'm seeing you. Yeah. Facebook you can't
00:26:43 you literally can't use I mean you can but you're not supposed to use fake names on Facebook or
00:26:48 Google Plus. The way I see it now is people like us who are anime fans, who are nerds,
00:26:54 who are people who have like either internet followings or just do fun stuff on the internet or
00:26:59 like play a lot of video games. We all make up our own names and those identities are kind of separate.
00:27:04 Then we have our Facebook identities where we all use our real names and that's where you know
00:27:09 because our families see those which is why we'd never update them and like that's because that's
00:27:13 the reason why I quit Facebook because my mom is on it and like because so you don't you don't really
00:27:17 want to show that side but then because you don't really even interact with that side it's less you
00:27:22 but the side that is more you is the side where you're using a crazy weird internet name and that
00:27:26 kind of brings me I mean oh yeah like to compare now to then like right now we're in a podcast where
00:27:32 we've got Ben St and Tom Oliver and both of those are like not their real names but they're
00:27:38 halfway there like they're practically their real names and everyone knows that you're Jimmy
00:27:43 and most people probably know my real name but like 10 years ago no one would be using a name
00:27:50 that was anywhere near their real name like you would not be like you know using a name that's like
00:27:56 a vague version of your real name exactly which is why which is why like Digi Bro you know yeah
00:28:01 which is why like Digi Bro is so far off from Conrad and why Nino is so far off from Jimmy
00:28:06 because it's like I remember I was playing I wanted to the reason I got this Nino name because
00:28:11 everyone asked me this question and I like giving this like origin story like it also ties into like
00:28:16 the origin story because I would play a lot of games and one game one game that really typifies my
00:28:21 experience with the internet is the arctic games like the battle those arctic battle you know games
00:28:28 like the dragon the dragon fables the adventure quests or the the met quests never heard of
00:28:34 yeah I know you guys I mean you guys probably haven't heard of them but like I've heard of
00:28:37 adventure quests yeah those games those games are really big oh adventure quests oh god damn
00:28:43 fucking damn adventure quests holy shit just fucking shoot me in the fucking head dude
00:28:47 yes I knew you guys would have just shoot me starring David Spade god damn it yes like those
00:28:53 games were such an important like I don't like they're all shit they're all absolute garbage
00:28:57 but those games were such an important part of my childhood and my experience with the internet
00:29:03 but like dude thank you for reminding me about it playing adventure quests in high school during
00:29:07 study period and my fucking library computer you know what's what I would do I'm shocked that
00:29:13 none of us were runescape players I because yeah I hated runescape I because I kept hearing about it
00:29:20 I didn't like yeah yeah yeah if if we had hippocrite here he was a big runescape player
00:29:32 yeah because I remember okay so like like when I know comes from is I was trying to play adventure
00:29:37 quest and every name out because another annoying thing about the internet back in the day was
00:29:41 you're putting a name and it was already taken that's that still gets to me so then I was like you
00:29:45 know what I'm gonna make a name that's never ever going to be taken online again so I put
00:29:50 six letters that were absolute gibberish that could sound like a name together and that's when
00:29:54 Nino came from and I've turned it I've turned it in to the empire I've turned it in to me to the
00:30:01 massive to the massive identity it is today it's your brand now it's my brand so that whole
00:30:08 nine zero thing doesn't actually mean anything it's just your name the okay the nine the nine zero
00:30:13 that I add the nine zero because people always mispronounce NINOUH when they first hear it like
00:30:19 I knew that your name was you know like I just thought that there was some deeper meaning
00:30:24 yeah also because oh no nine nine nine zero is my like nine ninety is my favorite number
00:30:29 nine ninety and four are my favorite numbers those are my two favorite numbers but like it's
00:30:34 nine very interesting choices yeah well I have a philosophy I have a philosophical reason for
00:30:39 ninety but I'm not gonna actually get into that it's so weird it's I said it while I was drunk
00:30:42 one time I don't want to dig back in my brain for it but um like so playing these games kind of just
00:30:50 pushed me into understanding because that was one of my first brushes with anime because I would read
00:30:56 the blog of the guy who made the arctic games and he said oh we we use such as like I remember he said
00:31:04 I like to use the record of lotus war as a reference for this part of the game and something
00:31:09 I was like what is record of lotus war look that up on the internet found out what that was
00:31:14 and again I that was also another part of how I started learning today when I learned google
00:31:19 I would just type in random things and I would find them like I would just find
00:31:25 hours upon hours worth worth of just information and stuff that I could just read about and it
00:31:30 was the most interesting thing because I was like some like nine zero at this point I was like nine
00:31:36 ten and all that all I was doing was just on the internet occasionally looking at hentai
00:31:42 occasionally looking at like naked cartoons that I would you know I would watch on tv and then
00:31:48 and then I would also just be playing a bunch of weird obscured shitty 2d games online and
00:31:56 it was around that point that I started to actually truly discover anime because I was in school one
00:32:02 day and this was Naruto took my school by stone I don't know how but Naruto I was living in Ghana
00:32:11 at the time right so it was at home all of our internet sucked because Ghana and internet is trash
00:32:18 but our school had this really special router that made it a little bit better so if people
00:32:22 wanted to watch videos they would all just go and use it on there so we I remember everybody one
00:32:29 day I just saw everybody was on youtube looking at you know clips of Naruto and it was like what's
00:32:36 what's going on like what like what like why why why is everyone looking at this weird Chinese
00:32:41 cartoon or whatever so I would ask them oh so what is this oh it's Naruto go go go on youtube and look
00:32:48 up and I look I decided to look up and I was like oh Naruto isn't that cool but what really got me was
00:32:55 was when I found was when I like played this you know Bleach game on PSP at my friend's house
00:33:00 and then I was like you know what let me look this up on the internet because I didn't know Bleach
00:33:04 had an anime either so I looked up Bleach and I found Bleach on youtube and that's like from
00:33:09 from then on I just started watching it and watching it it's funny I was like in my head I'm like wait
00:33:13 Bleach was on adult swim and then I remembered you were in Ghana yeah no no no here's the crazy
00:33:18 thing here's another crazy thing anime on TV not a thing when you live in Africa when you grew up in
00:33:23 Africa yeah that's not that crazy I'm not surprised by that I'm pulling the slightest yeah like
00:33:28 but the thing is we had we had loads of TV shows we had like band 10 we had um we had pretty much
00:33:35 anime yeah we had pretty much every Cartoon Network show and Disney show like Tom's leaving
00:33:40 but I can't tell if he already took off did you want to take off the microphone still on or not
00:33:44 he said he said he said he said he's gonna leave the recording going in case he just wants to
00:33:48 drop back in I think he didn't mute his microphone I think you can mute him well no but what if he
00:33:53 comes back well someone someone type in the chat when you get back when you get back like you
00:33:58 on mute just will tell us or I mean I don't know it's weird um but yeah so yeah I did it okay okay
00:34:05 yeah um wait let me go back let me go back in time let me take you on a journey yeah to me
00:34:12 in high school home star runner oh man greatest of all internet I know I mentioned this and that
00:34:19 just like you did you like it and I feel like I I can't I can't let it go I gotta go back uh
00:34:25 yeah I was I mean I was kind of on Newgrounds a bit I didn't make a habit of going there all the time
00:34:31 but I uh yeah my one of my friends he was always quoting this he was always like quoting something
00:34:37 and some like love you puff my smell was like hey man what are you talking about and he showed me
00:34:43 home star and I was wicked into home so I bought a t-shirt I bought home star and a t-shirt so I
00:34:48 wore them to school all the time it was basically the best thing ever and you made online purchases
00:34:52 in the mid-2000s I guess I did I think I asked for them for birthday presents that's another thing
00:34:59 when you're like money over the internet was the is the most weird situation because when I was a
00:35:06 kid spending money on things over the internet was such an alien concept to me which is why like
00:35:12 people ask me jimmy you pay for a cultural account as well as you and you also still
00:35:17 torrent anime it's like because I can't get the torrenting like I can't get the download mindset
00:35:22 out of my head because when you when you live when you live in Ghana when you live in Africa
00:35:26 like and you're growing up you you're you're they don't ship to you they don't ship anything to you
00:35:32 like they won't do like there are there are pure like there are some pure boxes but here's the
00:35:38 craze the funny stuff I know you guys have heard the whole Nigerian prince thing like the whole
00:35:42 you know type of thing oh god did you know what Nigeria is?
00:35:48 guess guess what happens when you owe me 10,000
00:35:53 guess what happens when loads of people from your country make a bunch of scams and end up on American
00:35:58 news your country gets blacklisted and countries around you get blacklisted on amazon and a bunch
00:36:04 of other sites so to this day a bunch of my cousins and family can't order things on amazon
00:36:09 which is absolutely fucking mental so that's wicked fuck yeah so so but like you they can
00:36:15 still order through some means like they they ship it's it's it's much more trouble than it's
00:36:19 scorched earth policy yeah it's like the whole fucking country well I mean because okay here's
00:36:25 is a weird tangent because my uncle used to be one of those guys who used to scam people I'm sorry
00:36:29 I'm sorry like it's it's it's it's a real thing and like people really people really did it like
00:36:36 people he made a lot of money doing it but like my uncle used to be one of those guys who used to do it
00:36:40 and he told me stories about guys who he told me stories about guys who would like trick really
00:36:47 big business men into thinking they were ladies on the internet and like seducing seducing them
00:36:54 and telling them a bunch of crazy things and the other thing is they would they would then
00:36:58 seduce a bunch of rich ladies and then convince them to come to Nigeria and give them money in person
00:37:05 it was those these stories are fucking mental I know these kind because there's it's a lot of like
00:37:10 like uh like I've seen some of this second hand where it'll be like um like middle-aged women who
00:37:17 are like lonely at home and they start talking to like exotic foreigners from like Morocco and
00:37:23 yeah yeah you know and those those people have ulterior motives and they just want like a way
00:37:28 to get to the US you know which is why like which is why I feel like I have a being Nigerian also
00:37:35 being British what family Nigerian like I have this weird unique perspective when I see something
00:37:40 shifty on the internet and this has been instilled in me like from a very young age when I see
00:37:45 something shifty on the internet I I immediately call call you know call it on bullshit like
00:37:50 loads of people for example you know tinder right like the whole tinder thing oh I know a thing
00:37:55 yeah people didn't really catch like people in my college Ben well-laid patreon saint over here
00:38:08 but yeah um people didn't really know about the whole bot thing on tinder like until like yeah
00:38:14 people don't people didn't know that there were bots on tinder until like oh bots yeah I heard
00:38:19 but no I heard but sorry yeah the accent the accent guys I'm sorry I'm sorry but um yeah people
00:38:27 didn't know that there were like uh botted accounts in my in my in my college and I would I would be the
00:38:32 one to tell them no no like this is a bot because look all of them are pictures there's no description
00:38:38 and she's talking to you first it's a fucking trap like yeah it's a fucking trap so like I feel
00:38:45 like I was the only person who was able to figure that out purely because my childhood had indicated
00:38:51 and because the people I was raised with had indicated me into knowing like they had just
00:38:55 instigated me into knowing that oh yeah this is the you know this is how the shifty side of the
00:38:59 internet works don't trust it especially if you get really really shady friend you know friend
00:39:04 because on Facebook people people to this day don't understand that that's a bad sign it's like
00:39:08 it's weird like um last thing last thing about homestar runner when I asked my mom for for
00:39:15 homestar runner t-shirts and she she purchased me t-shirts for my birthday or whatever I remember
00:39:20 she said she was like Ben you know you should you should you should create you should make
00:39:26 something like this you should make content on the internet I mean she didn't use those words
00:39:30 but she was like this is a lucrative business here I am spending money
00:39:34 on these people that made some funny cartoon on the internet you should do something like that
00:39:39 and I was like haha yeah right mom not a damn shame I know right and now look at me now look at me
00:39:46 making content on the internet I want you to make I want you to make a t-shirt where Vincent is
00:39:52 vaping and like and like and like the the smoke the smoke from Vincent's vape just makes a logo
00:39:59 the vapors and then that's the t-shirt I I really need to sell a t-shirt even one t-shirt I just
00:40:06 need one oh you know what you know what I know I'll if you'll if you'll buy the first one if I if I
00:40:13 can pony up cash yeah definitely if I have one if I have one guaranteed sale it'll all be worth it
00:40:18 it'll all be worth it but definitely like done like a vapors t-shirt would be would be pretty cool
00:40:23 the digi bro t-shirt would be cool too I should fucking make it I can't yeah I can't I was thinking
00:40:28 I should make a t-shirt myself and I was like I can't put Huey Freeman on the t-shirt that's
00:40:31 copyrights since I feel like uh all of us are sort of getting towards the the like late 2000s
00:40:37 now in our stories I think I should run through my whole everything up to that point so I can
00:40:41 catch up with everybody so like so I got into the internet like pretty early like 2001 ish
00:40:49 maybe earlier well I mean I actually my parents for whatever reason and I really don't understand
00:40:54 why because they are they were not tech savvy at all until like deep into the 2000s maybe even the
00:41:01 2010s but like for whatever reason they just wanted to be like early adopters of new things so they
00:41:08 bought a computer because your parents are based as fuck that's why yeah they got they got a windows
00:41:15 me uh computer in like 98 see that's but the funny thing is like because they're not tech savvy at
00:41:21 all like they will get whatever the new thing is without having any idea if it's good or bad or
00:41:28 like how people feel about it they just because they'll walk into like Best Buy and be like
00:41:33 what's the the new computer and they'll you know Best Buy is just going to push whatever the fucking
00:41:38 newest thing is that's going to make them the most money see they bought a windows me computer
00:41:42 which uh historically is frowned upon as one of the worst operating systems I think but uh they
00:41:47 wouldn't have known that and I remember as like a little kid in the 90s I would I guess use like
00:41:54 lycos or uh yahoo or whatever like the early search engines and I would ask jeeves yeah I would search
00:42:03 I would I wonder how those ask jeeves guys feel like I want to just how they feel the fuck out
00:42:10 I feel like there's kids watching this like what the fuck is ask jeeves like who the fuck is this
00:42:15 jeeves man back in back in the day there was another search engine called ask jeeves and they
00:42:20 were going head to head with google guess who won yeah go yeah if you want to find out about ask
00:42:26 jeeves just google it so yeah in the late 90s like my first memories of what I would use the computer
00:42:35 for is I would search like beast wars and like I don't know if I was on like their official website
00:42:41 or whatever but they'd have like little like thumbnails of screenshots from the show and I
00:42:45 would just print those out like we had a printer like a color printer and I would just print out
00:42:51 all these fucking like a whole sheet of paper with just a little thumbnail like a youtube thumbnail
00:42:56 sized picture of something from beast wars because that was my favorite show and I thought it was
00:43:00 like so cool to have like all these and I had like a I had just like a stack of printed out
00:43:06 beast wars pictures in my room and then later when I got into pokemon I would spend a lot of time
00:43:11 on the pokemon website because they had like a full pokedex on there and at one point I like drew
00:43:17 all the pokemon from the pokedex and they had all this other shit but like at that point it was
00:43:22 just like you know website like I knew about a website connected to a show kind of like what
00:43:26 jimmy was saying earlier yeah and then like um I don't know exactly how I like discovered the
00:43:33 concept of forums again I think my mom was getting into the matter at the same time in 2001 but I
00:43:38 was really into yugioh and I found a yugioh forum um so I made an account there I think my name was
00:43:45 just like a string of ones like it was that kind of thing like I would forget my password all the
00:43:50 time because it would be something stupid and I just make a bunch of new accounts for the names
00:43:53 or just more ones um and then I would post on this yugioh forum and then like I was there for a
00:44:00 little while and then I think my cousin started getting into the internet around the same time
00:44:05 and he would like do use it for research on anime because we got into anime in like 01 and 02 and so
00:44:11 like he would start actually you know what this is all 2002 jump jump it forward a year uh he would
00:44:17 start like uh trying to find new information about anime and stuff and I think he found like anime
00:44:24 news network around the time he found uh he found he would find these different forums and so we both
00:44:29 became a part of a forum called otaku boards and I would spend all fucking day on otaku boards
00:44:36 like all I did was read and post there and um there were like a few other like anime forums but
00:44:41 otaku boards was my favorite one because they had more of like a tightly knit community where people
00:44:44 kind of knew who each other were whereas a lot of the other ones would just be like people posting
00:44:49 into the void um there was like anime suki forums I found that like a little bit later uh but yeah
00:44:56 I was like really big into forums because it was a place where you could like share your thoughts
00:44:59 on things and read what other people are saying and I loved knowing about like what what what people
00:45:05 are like into you know like all the anime we would watch would be like stuff that people were
00:45:10 recommending in the forums so like we knew about Eva because everyone would talk about Evan Gellion
00:45:15 and how it's like supposedly the best anime ever so like we went out and bought the DVDs and and
00:45:19 Helsing was really popular for some reason so like like yeah that was a huge part of me getting
00:45:25 into anime was through forums and then of course like I said he was using line wire and ruining my
00:45:30 computers um and then like I discovered the game FAQs forums and would hang out in there uh and
00:45:37 talk about Tales of Symphonia because like every game has its own forum on game FAQs so I got really
00:45:42 obsessed with the Tales of Symphonia forums and then from there me and a few people from that
00:45:47 started up like a freeboards thing where it was like just you know like 10 people on this forum
00:45:53 and let me tell you there is nothing in this world that is probably worse for a 14 year old
00:46:01 than being a part of like a tightly knit group of teenagers on the internet so so it just so
00:46:08 happened that we started this forum like right around the time that I was becoming like really
00:46:13 depressed uh my parents uh were fighting a lot like their marriage wasn't going so well um I I
00:46:21 we we switched I switched schools like we moved to the ghetto and this was when I went to a school
00:46:25 where I was like the only white kid there and I didn't make any friends so I would just hole up
00:46:30 in my mom's office because she was one who had a computer and I would sit on the forums all day
00:46:34 and we had the the fucking worst internet connection because we couldn't afford it at the time so like
00:46:39 it would take like two and a half minutes to load a page like of a forum so what I would do is I
00:46:47 would get into conversations with people on like this message board and like I would type a message
00:46:51 and hit send and then just sit there waiting you know and just and then I would reload the
00:46:56 page every couple of minutes until they would respond and just talk to people that way and
00:47:00 like I was in all these like everyone had like all these emotional relationships and stuff it's
00:47:05 like a bad anime like it whenever you see those romantic comedy shows where it's like everyone's
00:47:10 in love with someone else and the relationships keep changing like that's what it was like
00:47:14 were there were there girls in that group there were but I'm pretty like there was one girl in
00:47:20 there that I was like in love with and in retrospect I am convinced was a troll like I am 100%
00:47:27 convinced that they were running like a really high level trolling operation on me like I'm
00:47:34 convinced of it I don't have any evidence but like it just seems that way from like looking back on
00:47:38 it with what I know now it's like yeah I'm pretty sure this is like an extensive trolling operation
00:47:43 yeah I feel like despite despite everybody despite everything I said about not actually
00:47:49 making any friends on the internet and not actually talking to anyone there was this one girl who
00:47:54 wasn't necessarily she wasn't necessarily like someone I met through a forum she was like a
00:47:59 friend of a friend but yeah the only interaction I ever I've ever had with her in my entire life
00:48:05 is through the internet like he introduced me to her through Facebook and then we moved from
00:48:11 Facebook to MSN and I don't know if kids there's another thing kids aren't gonna fucking know about
00:48:16 back before Skype was a thing guys MSN MSN messenger was lit I was an AIM guy myself
00:48:25 oh yeah those AIM Yahoo MSN and fucking AOL Skype killed them all Skype murdered every single one
00:48:35 of them everyone in my high school we all we when we weren't in school we would talk through AIM
00:48:41 yeah like it used to be really segmented it used to be really segmented and then Skype came and
00:48:45 just wiped them all and now discord is slowly coming and just wiping off Skype so like it's uh
00:48:52 I remember uh I was I was really into fanfiction.net oh man I I printed out I printed out fan fiction
00:49:01 stories that I found of interest including some saucy ones uh many saucy ones actually I printed
00:49:06 out some uh a legend of Dragoon uh saucy fanfiction and I had a big thick folder I took it to school
00:49:13 and I showed my friends I was like look at these saucy fan fictions my friends uh well are you
00:49:19 are you not are you not entertained around that's around that period is when I was writing saucy
00:49:24 fan fictions and posting them to fanfiction.net I hope oh god I never found it did you ever
00:49:33 read Tales of Symphonia fanfics oh no never I feel like I feel like did you just like oh well
00:49:38 you know and that was my old stomping ground back in the day so so through those forums is how I
00:49:45 learned about like you know a lot of internet stuff like again fanfiction.net was a was what I
00:49:50 knew about and like mostly websites because like I never got into like the whole downloading and
00:49:55 shit just because like my internet was so bad and like online gaming was a total mystery to me
00:50:00 because that the idea of having a good enough connection to do anything like that online was
00:50:05 you know not a thing I feel like I feel like the more I now that I've moved to America and I'm
00:50:12 starting to look back on my life and my childhood I'm learning that more and more of my personal
00:50:18 gripes and grievances are very very tied into where I grew up because when I was growing up in
00:50:25 Ghana and like I would again Ghana Nigeria to go like oh I say grown up in Ghana but I was
00:50:30 growing up in like three different countries but it's weird like when I was growing up there
00:50:35 it was like I had a console I would play video games my parents would like I would never buy them
00:50:40 there but like my parents would always travel to like America or England and buy me video games
00:50:44 all the time and I'll be playing I'll play pretty much all the same games you guys played
00:50:49 you know had a regular childhood and everything but like I would never play them online every single
00:50:54 game I tried to play online the internet was way too slow for it to work I I could never like
00:51:00 actually spend enough time or actually like actively be you know concerned enough with the
00:51:06 internet to try and play games the types of games I liked playing would were usually single player
00:51:11 games so I gravitated away from online gaming so yeah so oh let me finish this a little bit
00:51:19 yeah sure go ahead like the the whole concept of online gaming to me felt really pointless and alien
00:51:25 for the longest time and up until now I'm seeing people say that online gaming is the only true
00:51:31 way to play video games like the fuck it is like I don't I don't I don't get the online gaming meme
00:51:39 why can't it die like that that should be please time travel me back time travel me back to that
00:51:46 fucking podcast online gaming is a meme that needs to die I think we actually did bring that
00:51:50 that part didn't we I don't think you did I had a bunch of I had a bunch of friends when I was in
00:51:56 I don't know how a teenager or whatever that played Ragnarok online and I went up and I and I
00:52:01 thought that the graphics looked really cool it was like it looked like online a little fancier
00:52:06 yeah it looked really cool and I really wanted to play it but like I couldn't fucking make it work
00:52:11 on my computer for whatever reason I actually I did event I did eventually get a final fantasy
00:52:16 it was 11 the online one yeah yeah I did eventually get final fantasy 11 it was like a big event me
00:52:23 and me and Nate both got it and we were both like wicked stoked to play it but like it was it was
00:52:27 terrible I mean it was bad for me I could not be asked to fucking form up a part I didn't want to
00:52:33 fuck around complicated ass game I just wanted to play it solo and build up a character and have
00:52:38 a cool looking red mage with a big red hat that's all I wanted but I did not want to fuck around
00:52:43 building parties and grinding and all that shit so I gave up I gave up online was actually the first
00:52:48 online game that I did play and that was in like 03 which is way before I knew how those things
00:52:52 worked but again my cousin was around and like we would get these I don't remember how I'm assuming
00:52:57 it had something to do with the anime stuff that we were buying but we would get these like free
00:53:02 trials for for Ragnarok like a seven day free trial disc kind of thing like in the mail I guess
00:53:08 probably with like anime magazines I don't know but um yeah I had like these trial discs for that
00:53:13 so I actually got to play that um like very briefly in those years and I thought it was the
00:53:18 by far the coolest thing that had ever happened in the universe like it was fucking awesome the
00:53:24 music alone in that game is incredible and I did eventually get to play it later because like
00:53:29 you know after this part that I'm talking about like for me it was like 2006 the internet opened
00:53:34 up massively because this was when we moved out of the ghetto we moved into a nicer house we finally
00:53:39 got like decent internet for the first time and it was like all at once uh YouTube started being a
00:53:45 thing and I found out about that through like again like people literally just linking videos on forums
00:53:50 I was like what is this thing you know um so I got I found out about YouTube then uh we had a good
00:53:57 enough connection that we started playing um World of Warcraft uh because Victor really wanted to
00:54:01 play it and he got my parents bought him for his birthday a mac book or not book but uh a mac computer
00:54:08 um it was like one of the first generations where they had the the computer built into the screen
00:54:13 so it's like a fatter screen than the ones they have now but it's not oh yeah yeah yeah I think
00:54:18 my aunt has one of those my aunt has one of those that they don't they don't actually have like a
00:54:23 standard cpu like tower they have just a screen and it's all in there yeah I remember those yeah
00:54:28 so she so he had one of those and they got it for him because like they told the people at Best Buy
00:54:33 that he wanted to like make like movies and stuff on it you know oh boy again again the mac is for art
00:54:40 meme the mac is for art meme it wasn't even the mac is for art meme it was that they showed my parents
00:54:48 like i-movie and garage band and my parents were in like photo booth which are like the you know
00:54:54 stock programs it comes with i-movie is like you can put clip it's like the windows movie maker of
00:55:00 no no no I have I've used i-movie i-movie is a it's like a tiny team to step up from windows
00:55:06 movie maker but it's still shit like well the the best thing about i-movie is that you could record
00:55:11 in the program and the mac they got him had a built-in uh camera on top so like a built-in webcam
00:55:17 so you can actually record directly into i-movie we made a bunch of dumb like action figure movies
00:55:22 that way and then uh it had photo booth which was like you could take a picture and do like all the
00:55:27 weird little distortion effects like the instagram type shit but that was enough that they showed
00:55:31 that to my parents in the store and they were so impressed with those effects that like you could
00:55:36 make you could take a picture and make it black and white it was like mind-blowing to them so they
00:55:42 bought this mac computer for Vic and he would play world of warcraft on it and uh
00:55:47 and then basically because my computer had again had been ruined so it couldn't go online at all
00:55:53 and what i would do is i would get on victor's computer while he was at school um and like
00:55:59 like he was in middle school and i was starting high school so like there was a two hour point
00:56:05 before he would get home after i got home and then i would also wake up early in the morning
00:56:10 and i'd gotten on to did any of you guys read megatocchio back in the day uh back in the day
00:56:17 i like megatocchio the website yeah the web webcomic oh the webcomic yeah i think i think
00:56:24 i did i think i've at least heard of it yeah megatocchio was a big webcomic from the uh like
00:56:30 2003 which i read a lot of those back i've read like all of sluggy freelance and all of megatocchio
00:56:35 and like a bunch of those old webcomics um but i was really into megatocchio back then and then
00:56:40 i got back into it in 2000 like late 2006 early 2007 and i started hanging out in the forums
00:56:47 because i figured out they had a forum there oh this is one of those OELs okay yeah it's an OEL
00:56:53 manga and it's like the OEL manga like the the first like big popular one um yeah my friend
00:57:01 who who does comics now he he told he told me about this yeah continue yeah um and it was
00:57:06 because the thing about megatocchio is that it was like it was an OEL but whereas most of those
00:57:12 are inspired by people who grew up on like DBZ and shit like that like the guy who wrote megatocchio
00:57:17 was a fucking otaku and like the biggest influences on it were canon and air the visual novels like
00:57:24 this is way before those had anime adaptations he would talk about canon all the fucking time
00:57:29 and like it wasn't until 2006 that that became a popular anime show you know like now everyone
00:57:34 knows what aclanat is but back then that was really obscure shit so uh so this dude was like
00:57:40 you know hugely visual novel influenced and um and as a result like the people in the forums
00:57:47 were like to this day like a lot of the biggest anime fans that i follow are people i knew from
00:57:53 the megatocchio forums and like through those forums it just so happened that like everyone
00:57:58 had an anime blog and they were all on wordpress and uh even the guy who was the admin of the forums
00:58:04 um the guy named omo uh who i still follow his fucking anime blog to this day um they all had
00:58:11 these anime blogs and i saw all those and i decided to make my own anime blog just kind of to follow
00:58:16 the crowd you know and it was through them that i found out about like both like internet streaming
00:58:22 of anime and that it was being subtitled by fans because up till this point i had only seen anime
00:58:29 either through cartoon network or through buying dvds and um i didn't know at all that you could
00:58:36 download it or watch it online so they were telling me like you know about all these shows that were
00:58:41 brand new that uh just started um in japan hold on i have to unmute tom real quick oh okay he's back
00:58:47 he's back hey tom he's back um yeah so so you so you caught up to like i won't say caught up but
00:58:53 like you were in on the front lines of the airing shows kind of thing fairly early yeah well i mean
00:59:01 for for a lot of those people in the megatocchio forums a lot of them were like older anime fans
00:59:05 who'd been trading tapes in the 90s like that kind of shit you know so they were just all so you were
00:59:11 so you just stumbled upon second boomers you just yeah i i somehow randomly managed to like the first
00:59:18 anime community i was really a part of it was like a good even split between people who were like new
00:59:23 like me who were just finding out about like new airing shows or had been into it for like a couple
00:59:27 of years and then other people who were like long time people who'd been torrenting for
00:59:32 fucking since it was a thing to torrent you know so like everyone in here like really knew their
00:59:37 shit and they were talking about these these new airing shows and like um you know i just found
00:59:42 out about like haruhi and i i watched all of haruhi on youtube in like probably 240p or something
00:59:48 like that and like uh because this was before copyright was oh man like that's that's that's
00:59:53 another that's another conjuncture point watching anime on youtube kids yeah remember when you could
00:59:58 watch anime on youtube remember what that was oh god yeah but um one two one three
01:00:08 with the stuff these guys were watching it was stuff that was you know it was only getting
01:00:11 fansubbed and no one else on the internet had heard of it so you really had to be someone who
01:00:16 like knew about these shows if you wanted to watch them but there was a site that had pretty much
01:00:22 every fansubbed anime on it it was if this was not the best streaming site in terms of like quality
01:00:28 of video or uh being able to full screen if you didn't have a paid account you had to watch if you
01:00:34 didn't have a paid account on this illegal website you had to watch everything in a tiny little screen
01:00:40 in like the minimum quality and it was like it was like especially small and you had to watch
01:00:45 everything that way but this website had every fucking anime on it get yeah guess what the name
01:00:51 were these the early days of crunchy roll this was crunchy roll in 2007 of course it was the most
01:00:58 illegal website in the world crunchy roll which had every anime ever on it so i watched like all
01:01:06 these shows that like all these obscure anime come yeah well that's the thing i think the reason
01:01:13 that crunchy roll was able to become legitimate so easily is because they had a pay structure in place
01:01:19 because even though it was illegal they you had to have an account to like watch stuff in certain
01:01:24 ways so i think because they already had like a system of paying for their content it was very
01:01:30 easy for them to legitimize it you know the point that really it's like something that happened very
01:01:34 recently that just fucked with my head i saw a television ad for crunchy roll while i was watching
01:01:39 it yeah with anamon agucci said yeah and i was watching awesome and then i was like watching like
01:01:44 stuff like sao and a bunch of shows that would that will never get on american tv in this ad
01:01:49 and i was just like fucking holy shit i saw that ad not on card to network i saw it on like regular
01:01:56 tv like my parents were watching tv and it was on and i was like what the fuck crunchy roll i think
01:02:02 it's for you for you you were there in the genesis of that shit like dude jimmy did you know that
01:02:08 crunchy roll is about to start doing dvds and blu rays like they're licensing now i think because
01:02:14 they said apparently they're gonna dub cabinary and release it on dvd oh man i just read that the
01:02:19 other day so yeah that's how far they've come but yeah so it was like crunchy roll and a few
01:02:25 other like wherever i could find the episodes of these shows um and then like everything this is
01:02:32 like the fire nation attacked moment for me like the moment because when crunchy roll started taking
01:02:39 out everyone else like no no no uh the the fire nation attack moment came later in 2007 so at
01:02:45 this point i you know i've learned about anime blogs i've made all these friends with these
01:02:49 people who know all this just deeper stuff about anime and like i think there's like when you want
01:02:54 i think all of us can generally agree that a big part of this is finding out about something and
01:02:59 wanting it and then having to go learn how to get it like you find out about oh there's anime
01:03:06 that's being fansub that comes out in japan right now and so now your mission in life is to learn
01:03:10 how to get it you know like for example like i was just talking earlier like before the podcast
01:03:16 started about watching about reading a bunch of comic books and like start getting into getting
01:03:21 back into comics and learning how comics worked like it was it kind of you know it was kind of
01:03:27 nostalgic because i was learning how to get into a thing i wanted to do that you kind of have to
01:03:33 jump through hoops for because you have to you have to you have to download a bunch you have to
01:03:37 download a bunch of fucking cbrs off the internet and if they're not in cbr form you have to download
01:03:41 image sets then convert them to cbr form and then put them on your phone or no then download
01:03:47 comic book readers a bunch of crazies i think that what what i think is the biggest difference
01:03:51 between what the internet is now and what it was in the 2000s and i think it was like i think the
01:03:56 internet continued developing in the same direction through the whole 2000s until the very end and then
01:04:01 in like 2010 it completely snapped and went in the opposite direction but this is what i think
01:04:05 people who are new to the internet won't understand is that nowadays the internet is all about
01:04:11 streamlining and putting everything in one place and it used to be that the internet was about
01:04:16 having to go fucking everywhere to find something exactly because yes everyone had their own website
01:04:24 for example for example who here used to who here used to read manga week to week on like you
01:04:29 know like maybe it would be bleach it'll be now it'll be whatever we had yeah in my school when
01:04:35 i was growing up we had like hardcore analytical arguments one manga lets you enlarge the picture
01:04:41 this way does this way no no no no no no no no no no no no no manga volume is the best thing
01:04:47 is like did she says there were so many places you could go to yeah like everybody had their
01:04:56 place to go everybody had their like there was anime advice there was anime like those
01:05:01 dude i gotta say this is not really related but the i remember the first time i ever saw an hd
01:05:07 video stream like when youtube first rolled it out and it was fucking um jizz in my pants by
01:05:15 lonely island like the official music video was like full hd and i remember seeing it and it was
01:05:20 like blowing my mind into pieces because it was so good looking the thing is i like when i when
01:05:26 they first rolled that out when they first rolled that out like the you know actually let me this
01:05:31 oh okay here's a weird dichotomy actually this is a weird part of my internet story my my trips to
01:05:36 america before i started living here that that's a very interesting part because every time it
01:05:43 will you know okay maybe i'll use mmo logic for this if i was leveling up regularly and grinding
01:05:48 regularly when i was in Ghana and that was the normal progression every time i moved to america
01:05:53 it was like free exp day because i would go there i would come here and the internet was faster
01:06:00 because i was already savvy on how to get around the internet my only big block was the fact that
01:06:04 it was fucking slow now i already knew where to watch all the all the anime i wanted oh you
01:06:10 you guys are talking about how yeah you guys are talking about how like you know you would never
01:06:14 you would leave videos on from morning till evening i told you this but i remember loading
01:06:20 eight episodes of shaman king before i went to school coming back and yeah i remember specifically
01:06:26 that with uh spaceship operators because the whole show was on youtube and i opened up tabs of
01:06:33 every video and left them running the whole time i was at school and then came home and marathoned
01:06:37 the show um and that was in 07 but like oh sorry uh yeah well to get through the rest of this uh
01:06:45 part of my story like through all those uh forums and stuff like through mega tokyo and other forums
01:06:50 like that i started to find like the best part was that people would always link you to some like
01:06:55 database somewhere like uh anime news network is like the reason i've always known so much
01:07:00 shit about the backgrounds of like anime people is because i would just go to anime news network
01:07:05 and like read the whole staff lists of shows and stuff because they've they've they've consistently
01:07:10 yeah consistently they like i don't like the staff and they don't like me no no the people who run
01:07:16 anime news network are terrible but they are generally a great encyclopedia site it's a very
01:07:21 good encyclopedia like they they they have very they have very do you want to know why because
01:07:26 they get a bunch of interns who speak japanese and they just like they just i will say that my anime
01:07:31 list is slowly catching up with their encyclopedia but anna is still way more useful in general but
01:07:38 but mal has pictures for everything and that makes it a lot easier to find shit but uh but
01:07:44 anyway um and then there was like encyclopedia metalum which like is a metal encyclopedia and
01:07:50 pretentious metal fans will always tell you that if it's not listed on that website it's not metal
01:07:56 so if you if there's some band that you think is metal and it's not listed there it's not metal but
01:08:00 they have thousands and thousands of metal bands is baby metal there is baby metal there uh i'm not
01:08:05 sure i haven't checked they probably are because they're definitely metal but like i would go on
01:08:09 there and just search like uh like the category of avant-garde metal and then just listen to every
01:08:15 band on there so like a lot of how i the reason i have such a like ridiculously broad like knowledge
01:08:21 with most of the stuff i'm interested in is that i would just go to these like encyclopedia sites and
01:08:26 then just look up everything and i wanted to have all the knowledge that's the reason why people
01:08:30 ask me like how do you know so much about tokusatsu video games comment books etc bro fucking wikis
01:08:36 man exactly just go like i remember when i was a kid go fucking research when i was a kid i would
01:08:40 open up wicked because the thing is i would do a lot of reading because that was the only thing
01:08:44 i could consistently do easily without because video was out of the question when you're when
01:08:48 you're living in Ghana video was it because it would take too long to load so if something had a
01:08:52 video that had to that to watch like i couldn't watch anime but i could read about a whole
01:08:56 ton of them like i could i could read about a whole shit that's why i like i it's so rare for
01:09:01 someone to name an anime and i've never heard of it even if i haven't seen it like i probably know
01:09:06 what it's about because i've done so much research but like so i would i'll just sit down and read
01:09:11 for hours like old comic book stories from like the 80s and that's how i learned so much about
01:09:18 the flash that's how i learned so much about spider-man that's how i read through wikipedia
01:09:23 like through wikipedia text the entire clone saga which i then recently actually read through it the
01:09:30 comic book version i'll read the wikipedia version if you want that story the comic books are actually
01:09:36 completely fucking terrible anyway to get back to how like chaotic the internet was at the time
01:09:41 though like when because when i finally got into fansubs like torrenting had you know it'd become
01:09:46 a big thing but there was a lot of fansub groups who had been around since like the irc days and
01:09:51 they were like they were like really like i remember um live evil which is i think they're
01:09:58 still around um they they do like obscure 80s stuff and like they had put out this video for
01:10:03 the first episode of kimigure orange road and they put in like this whole intro at the start
01:10:07 where they were explaining like how people used to like watch kimigure orange road like by
01:10:13 shipping tapes around the world and like you know like hard coding fansubs onto the fucking tapes
01:10:18 like onto the actual yeah people don't people don't people don't realize like back i man i've
01:10:24 said this so many times if i could if i had the resources if i had like the the know how resources
01:10:31 and people to know i would organize a giant long form no giant long form like documentary on the
01:10:39 history of fansubbing yeah that would be great like like if you've got otaku no video does a
01:10:44 little bit of it yeah it does a little bit of it but i want i want i want i want like fucking a
01:10:49 giant long form because this is guy that this guy otaku do otaku guy or something otaking
01:10:55 otaking he made a weird little like you know opinionated video on what was wrong with fansubs
01:11:01 in his brief slide and actually that does factor into our into our story because there was a point
01:11:06 in fansubbing where they would fucking sub the complete wrong way they would fucking add all of
01:11:14 the weird japanese text in and oh yeah see you know translator notes out the wazoo it was it was
01:11:20 actually a mess and now it's become a lot more streamlined because of sites like crunchyroll
01:11:25 who right well that's kind of what i'm getting to is like with that live evil group like they
01:11:29 would talk they talked about how that history and then they were like very adamantly like
01:11:34 you have to come to our irc to download our shows because to them there was like the sense of
01:11:39 community was like a big part of like why they did fansubbing and that was true for a lot of
01:11:43 fansub groups and so like in the 2000s there was this huge shift where because like everyone wanted
01:11:50 stuff faster so fansub groups were were trying to pick up their speed and get stuff out as quick as
01:11:54 possible and everyone was torrenting and we had sites like tokyo toshokan and nia torrents which
01:12:01 are still around which are where like the big anime resource sites didn't baka didn't baka bt come
01:12:07 around around that time as well yeah and baka bt has always been like the one that's like great for
01:12:12 archiving shows like they have lots of full shows from like like they'll have the full highest quality
01:12:17 version of the show and uh they always had a rule where if you're a member you have to have like a
01:12:22 good seating ratio or else you get blocked um which happened to me a few times but yeah uh so so
01:12:29 there was these different torrent sites and like because people would just go there because they
01:12:33 would have you know every torrent then no one would talk to the fansubbers and people kept
01:12:38 getting more demanding of the fansubs people would complain that they weren't going fast enough people
01:12:42 would uh you know not really care about who's doing it they just want the product and so
01:12:48 like fansubbers hated it they hated the speed subbing culture because it was getting away from
01:12:54 like what you know what they had seen it as but then one streaming showed up it just killed all of
01:13:00 it because there was no point anymore because everyone wants stuff immediately and so if it gets
01:13:04 simulcast on Funimation and Crunchyroll and like even if the subs aren't the best like because there's
01:13:09 a lot of people who hate those subs for whatever reason because they can't understand Japanese
01:13:13 well enough for it not to matter like I can but the show comes out on Crunchyroll and then immediately
01:13:19 gets ripped by horrible subs and immediately put on uh Tokyo Toshio and that's everyone's
01:13:24 gonna watch it yeah on yeah that's how but a crazy thing is that kind of reminds me about
01:13:28 something that's been happening to me recently because I've been watching this Japanese action
01:13:32 series called High and Low it's a live action it's a live action martial arts series about
01:13:37 delinquent gangs in Tokyo and the the only person you can fucking get this show from there's only
01:13:44 one person you can get the show from in English only one person translating it because if you go
01:13:49 to kiss kiss asian which is like the drama site for where they have all the common writer stuff
01:13:54 they don't have all of the second season there's only one person on the internet who subbed
01:13:58 everything so far and her name is Yuri or Stormichu and I found this person by a complete
01:14:06 accident and they run a little tumblr site where she lists she'll list of raw she'll list a hard
01:14:11 sub version she'll she just you know and she talks to you about the she even has a thing where
01:14:16 you can watch and she has like her like commentary in in sub form along the top of the series along
01:14:22 top of the show and like I talked to on face on on on twitter sometimes I send her messages like oh
01:14:27 wow this episode was great and I was like shit this reminds me of like back when I was a kid
01:14:31 talking to the fansubbers right this reminds me it was yeah it was a blast from the past I I mean
01:14:37 I had to I for me and I finally getting to that moment I mentioned earlier that I completely
01:14:42 didn't actually say what it was the big explosion moment for me was when I met my friend Donsan
01:14:48 who I talked about in the never going outside podcast that he was the most internet savvy guy
01:14:54 ever because all he did was read everything on the internet because he was a hikikomori so he
01:14:59 taught like as soon as I met him like I knew about torrents but I didn't know how they worked
01:15:04 something like he was disgusted that I was watching streams he was like he was like uh how can you
01:15:10 watch in low quality you need it to be HD which HD at the time meant 480p but I will I will never
01:15:17 forget that the first thing he taught me how to do I downloaded shakugan no shana and I watched all
01:15:22 of it in downloads and it was the most beautiful show I'd ever seen because it was like oh my god
01:15:28 this looks amazing and so I got really into torrenting and I would because I picked this up from him
01:15:34 that uh you know this was before external hard drives were really cheap but what he would do is
01:15:40 he would buy stacks of CDs and DVDs and just burn en mass like anime downloads onto them as storage
01:15:48 so like I I did the same thing I have like all these old DVDs of like you know like suku yomi and
01:15:53 like all these 2006 era shows that I downloaded and like burn to CDs and they're all sitting
01:15:59 somewhere I remember yeah I remember when I first learned how to use torrents right
01:16:05 like obviously the idea of that like when I was young when I was younger the idea of downloading
01:16:12 something sodding off to go watch youtube and like in 20 minutes it would be done was a was a dream
01:16:18 that was a dream what you would do when I was a kid you'd that you'd wait till everyone's about
01:16:23 to sleep start the torrent go to bed wake up and it's it's halfway done that's what torrents would
01:16:29 take me like days like if I was downloading the whole show it was gonna be a few days before I got
01:16:35 to watch it you were nurturing it it was like you were nurturing it it was like it was like a like
01:16:40 a little project like you're taking care of it took a long time for like it wasn't until really like
01:16:45 the last year that it got like way better for me because of the fact that as internet speeds were
01:16:51 picking up so too were the file sizes yeah exactly there was a time where one episode of anime was
01:16:58 like under a hundred megabytes and now it's like half a gig at minimum you know so well I mean if
01:17:07 you watch all everything at 1080 yeah it's half a gig but I sell for 720 because I do too because
01:17:13 most anime doesn't actually broadcast in 1080 like yeah it looks like a movie then you gotta I
01:17:20 remember when I fucking downloaded paprika and it was like 10 gigs and I was like what the fuck
01:17:25 like this is not possible there's no way oh man that's not that's not the really didn't care for it
01:17:32 oh you've expressed that on the show before but I haven't seen it it's been talking up 10 gigs of
01:17:38 my fucking hard drive for 10 years it's acceptable it's an acceptable no because no okay so where
01:17:45 everything picked up for me like was the late 2000s because I was in boarding school and again
01:17:52 this wasn't because of any friend this wasn't because of any like you know mystical otaku
01:17:56 otaku person who came into my life and whisked me away into a magical land of weird bonus like I
01:18:02 this felt like this was more because I was getting fewer and fewer friends I was being driven more
01:18:07 and more into the depths of the internet like because I was in boarding school and I hated everyone
01:18:13 and well I mean being friends with don son didn't take me out of the internet at all because we
01:18:18 only talked online like he was a hikikomori like even though he lived in my town we didn't hang out
01:18:23 as much as we just sat on yahoo messenger all day and like message each other and like and it wasn't
01:18:29 just that he took because he taught me a lot of different stuff like I threw him I figured out
01:18:34 exactly how to use IRC and I would use that to like download manga and stuff and at one point I was
01:18:38 part of a scanslation team uh you know with an IRC channel um which you just go through you just
01:18:45 go through all the motions of being a weird yeah the internet right I had I I was a I was a proof
01:18:52 reader for a group called rice ball issues where I would just take the stuff and make it sound better
01:18:57 in English and uh fun fact and this is before anyone had heard of anything that this author had
01:19:06 ever done in the in the u.s. no no no no I knew about him by this point I was the proof reader
01:19:14 and this is if you go if you go read this chapter online on any of the websites I've checked and it's
01:19:20 it's the one I proof read uh excel world chapter one reiki kawahara's excel world uh the guy who
01:19:28 would go on to make sword on your most your most hated fucking show of all time I I proof read
01:19:36 chapter one of that and I got you're bound by you're bound to him forever yeah but I want I want
01:19:42 everyone in the audience to know this if you've ever read chapter one of that of that comic like
01:19:47 they were telling me because I I wanted to write like a lot of swears into it like in places where
01:19:52 it made sense and like I did get like they let me there was like a punk character and they let me go
01:19:56 all out with making him swear like crazy but there's a part where the fat kid like uh he gets like
01:20:03 this lunch made for him by this cute girl and he's a piece of shit so he throws the lunch on the ground
01:20:08 and he runs away and the way the framing of the panel is the only translation that would fit there
01:20:14 was I'm so fucked up the shinji ikari and I really wanted that there and they wouldn't let me because
01:20:21 they said he wouldn't swear because his language isn't that like you know and I was like oh fuck you
01:20:26 so if you're reading that go read it and change it in your head make him say I'm so fucked up there
01:20:32 it fits so perfectly and I was always mad that they made me change that um let me tell a story
01:20:39 of my internet life this is the greatest story this is the greatest deed I ever did this is the
01:20:45 ultimate chapter of my life I'll never top this this is the story of how I bend saint uh like
01:20:51 saint george slaying the dragon uh slew slew the dragon kin I slew the other kin forums
01:20:59 oh what did you what do you mean by slew well I'll tell you digi I'll tell you how this went down
01:21:06 I was on 4chan in like probably 2007 2008 now I never got hugely into 4chan culture I was never a
01:21:12 big poster but it did expose me to a lot of the shit that was out there and I came to understand
01:21:17 the other kin and what they were and the the concept of the other kin filled me with more
01:21:24 intellectual rage than than anything had up to that point just the just the way that they would
01:21:29 play fast and loose with their definitions the way that they would twist their words to to change
01:21:34 their reality to be what they wanted it to be the way that they could they could just define
01:21:39 being a dragon to be whatever they wanted it to so they could say oh I'm a dragon I'm a fairy
01:21:44 it made me so mad so of course I had to go and be with them on the internet so I went and I found
01:21:50 the other kin forums and I logged in and I made a fucking manifesto of a serial killer and I and I
01:21:56 made and I made like a persona for myself I was I was an angel kin and I went in there and I told
01:22:02 them guys I think I'm an angel and they were like this is where ben saint comes from by chance
01:22:08 probably all wrapped up in the same sort of neuroses so I so I was like I think I feel like a
01:22:14 connection to heaven and stuff I'm an angel kin and they were like cool totally and so I I started
01:22:19 telling them stories for my life and and but I started I started making shit up I started being
01:22:25 like today today I close my eyes and I and I felt my phantom wings I felt like you know six wings
01:22:32 from my back and they were like cool cool and then I was like today I today I passed my hand over
01:22:38 the hand over my friend and I blessed him with knowledge and he got a 100 this is exactly the
01:22:43 kind of trolling that I think was happening to me with that goal like it was exactly this brand
01:22:49 of trolling that I was experiencing and and I just I just got more and more out there with that I
01:22:54 said today I closed I can I can see with my eyes closed I can tell the future I have legitimate
01:23:00 superpowers I was like guys I have fucking superpowers hold up for just a second hold up for
01:23:05 just a second I'm looking I'm looking at the first chapter of excel world right now and I'm seeing
01:23:09 this guy I don't see this character say Arita you pigly little bitch don't fuck around with me
01:23:18 that's how you know I translated that you pig like a bitch only I would have put that that's pretty
01:23:25 good oh boy I gotta say wait proofreader said that said that said that was that something
01:23:32 that was you all right all right all right all right anyway anyway the point is eventually I got
01:23:39 banned right because they eventually figured out I was a troll because I was just because I was just
01:23:43 a superhero I was just telling them an actual superhero origin story I see but I wasn't giving up
01:23:47 I came back and I had a new identity and this time I was a mind I was a mind flayer from Dungeons
01:23:53 and Dragons I had the soul of a mind flayer and the thing about that is that it's not a
01:23:58 mythological creature Gary Gygax just made it up in the 70s it's like totally invented from whole
01:24:03 cloth but I pretended that it had this big mythical backstory eventually I got banned then I came back
01:24:08 with another persona and this persona I was I was I was a Japanese kami I was a spirit but the
01:24:14 spirit was of what I was a spirit of fatness I was a guy who just who just loved to eat I was
01:24:23 just like yes I that would be a thing that would be a Japanese deity there's a god of everything
01:24:28 yeah I weigh like 600 pounds and I'm only gonna get fatter I love being fat I love how fat I am
01:24:34 I'm going to become more fat and I identify personally on a spiritual level with my fat
01:24:39 that would get you double that would get you double love from both the the otherkin community
01:24:44 and the and like the people who are proud to be fucking fat yeah yeah yeah yeah and they found
01:24:51 this very offensive I was I was banned for that too and I was I was just fed up I was like these
01:24:56 fucks these fucking assholes won't let me express myself these these these people just these people
01:25:01 don't care about truth these people only care about but they just want sit to be the way they
01:25:06 want it to be and someone comes in with a different opinion and a different viewpoint and it scares
01:25:11 them and they hate it so I went on 4chan and I don't remember how I did it but the point is I
01:25:15 whipped up people into a fucking frenzy and I had and I organized a raid and they invaded
01:25:20 the otherkin forums and they literally got the raid you yes I yes I and I have and I destroyed
01:25:28 their so I temporarily disabled their servers and it was it was the best thing that ever happened
01:25:34 I know were you a part of this other kid raid right it's one of those things that you hear about
01:25:39 that everyone talks about is like hey you remember when do they like no people say like they remember
01:25:44 when they went 4chan raided the fucking other kid no people will be like I remember I heard it back
01:25:49 when it might have happened more than once yeah I don't know if I was like did the only one yeah
01:25:53 no I want yeah I'm sure I'm sure you want the only one but like I remember this happened around
01:25:58 4chan does have a long memory they remember everything yeah fucking made a part of 4chan 4chan
01:26:03 I remember like I used to hear a lot during 2014 while the tumblr raid was going on those are like
01:26:09 well what so hey guys post your favorite raids that we've ever done and then someone was like oh
01:26:13 yeah the otherkin forum raids were pretty good oh yeah those those faggots couldn't even handle
01:26:17 anything we shut down their servers for a whole week I was like oh wow that's pretty cool it's
01:26:20 to hear that you were like part of one of those was is that what I want yeah I gave them I I gave
01:26:25 I had like I had like a jolly rod because I was wicked big into one piece I had a jolly
01:26:29 rod made for myself I gave them out and like had people like people were like spamming the
01:26:35 otherkin forums with that image oh man it was it was it was a truly a truly wonderful time to be
01:26:41 me the saint pirates beware beware of the heavens the heaven scribe pirates the heaven scribe pirates
01:26:50 beware if you were yeah I was a fucking yeah I was a fucking nerd oh man oh so like okay but
01:26:56 like one one again I didn't really finish the story but one thing that really changed my perception
01:27:02 was when I moved when I not moved to America but like moving to America did a whole another thing
01:27:07 but when I started coming over to America for vacation I would that was when I first really
01:27:12 got into YouTube and like before all I would use YouTube for was to watch anime like that was all
01:27:18 YouTube that was the only benefit it had for me it was to watch uh three days grace videos
01:27:23 AMVs and uh an anime that was all I wanted that was that's all I wanted from it just a bunch of
01:27:28 weird punk grace yeah really shitty punk rock anime and AMVs sometimes AMVs brought both of
01:27:36 those things together but like um so I would and then when I came to America I found out about the
01:27:43 it's kind of like I got the classical education in internet memes that was I feel like that's what
01:27:49 happened I like when I the first time I came was 2008 so I got no 2006 so I got a classical
01:27:54 education in internet memes that's when I got my Numa Numa that's when I got my that's when
01:28:00 I got my 2006 no no no no oh yeah it is yeah it is that all yeah that is star wars lightsaber
01:28:10 kid Numa Numa yeah all of all of that stuff all of that stuff like
01:28:22 fuck who's the the gay black guy song the one oh yes oh what what in the but what in the but
01:28:31 what what in the oh fucking hell man I got this is probably would have been like 2008 yeah this
01:28:36 all this yeah because I remember I came 2006 2008 2009 and those three specific years I would get
01:28:43 such a jump in knowledge about what fucking like you had a whole year's worth of new
01:28:52 yes oh yes exactly oh man fucking all of these shitty internet memes what drip fed to me I think
01:28:58 I think shoot the whoop is the old is the oldest meme that I ever knew I think that was the first
01:29:04 meme I ever came into contact with like
01:29:12 oh badger badger badger badger badger badger badger mushroom mushroom yeah yeah like then
01:29:22 unless you count lol cats as a meme I think and then even me on cut was one of the memes that I
01:29:28 fucking go into an education like from that era that 2005 era that I was saying I wasn't really
01:29:34 into internet videos yet I I forgot that I did have a phase of getting really into albino black sheep
01:29:41 because like everyone knew like ebombs world at the time and like new grounds I had always heard
01:29:47 that ebombs world was a terrible place and you get viruses and there'd be dicks everywhere but like a
01:29:52 lot of the content on like a lot of the best stuff on ebombs world was all stolen from other places
01:29:57 and albino black sheep was this place that uh that I don't remember the name of the type of uh videos
01:30:04 they did but it was um like they had a bunch of videos where it'd be like like almost like
01:30:10 magazine cutout look to it where it'd be like just a bunch of like random celebrities and funny memes
01:30:15 and stuff like in these videos and they were some of them were fucking hilarious there's one called
01:30:19 French erotic film that I recommend everybody look up it's just a fun little song about Colin
01:30:25 mockery uh and a bunch of memes and uh it's great but like yeah like I got really into
01:30:32 that for a brief period and that was also I think where end of the world came from which is an internet
01:30:37 classic uh you guys remember legendary frog uh no legendary frog was a fucking peat piece of
01:30:47 shit god damn it so terrible in hindsight I think uh I think the llama song might have come from
01:30:53 albino black sheep yeah I I mean I don't know I'm not looking like I'm not embarrassed to have
01:31:00 liked homestar runner but I am embarrassed to have like legendary frog do any of you remember a video
01:31:06 called gonads and strife yes that's from albino black sheep as well gonads in the lightning in
01:31:14 the lightning in the rain I remember I remember fucking uh okay like also the idea of going into
01:31:23 the internet and finding like just the deepest going deeper and deeper into some stuff that like
01:31:28 you know nobody else is looking at but you're just there being entirely enamored by it for example
01:31:34 this is something I no one's ever been able to relate with me on I was I was a I know I was a
01:31:40 giant fan of this weird flash cartoon about not about knuckles it was it was like not it was like
01:31:48 a sprite flash cartoon like it was a bunch of sprites they took sprites from the sonic games
01:31:52 and a bunch of other like scarpcom video games and they made like a giant series it was called
01:31:58 knuckles adventure in fact let me fucking look this shit up because it's I I I
01:32:04 I
01:32:07 eight bit theater Tom did you read eight bit theater back in the day
01:32:11 you know what that was the one about the final fantasy characters right yeah I'll I was so into
01:32:16 eight bit theater I fucking bought that guy's book I bought his novel and it fucking sucked
01:32:22 even as a kid I knew that I could I was reading his novel and I was like this is a terrible book
01:32:27 this is an incredibly poorly written novel Brian Clevenger fuck you Brian Clevenger
01:32:32 I had six volumes of mega tokyo say dark horse would release it and I fuck me with a stick it's
01:32:40 still fucking there everybody go look up knuckles adventure it was demote to
01:32:47 no like no way the videos are still fucking there oh here's mine here's mine along those lines
01:32:55 oh fuck I don't even remember the name of it there was a web comic that I was like super
01:32:59 fucking into it was a sprite comic and oh my god I can't remember the name of it it was like
01:33:08 it was like it was like a goofy comedy adventure type thing but it was one where like as it went
01:33:13 along the story you know got darker and more violent and serious but always while having like a sort
01:33:18 of tongue-in-cheek attitude I just remember thinking that like in terms of writing quality I always
01:33:23 felt like it was the best web comic I had found but I can't fucking remember the name I'd like
01:33:29 you guys just to just give a little bit of a look to this because I like I opened up and the first
01:33:35 five seconds encapsulate why I was so into it as a kid because I will watch the first five seconds
01:33:42 of knuckles adventure oh my god what am I in for oh my this is so it's so amazing it's yeah it's
01:33:52 amazing the one word for it it's so amazing it's got Inuyasha in it holy shit I would have loved
01:34:02 this this is the kind of shit I was so into as a kid I would have absolutely loved this I know
01:34:10 like this oh man this was my shit look at this I'm able I would have definitely loved that because
01:34:19 you could tell as soon as I saw Inuyasha I would have been fucking sore exactly because knuckles
01:34:26 is cool enough but like Inuyasha they all had special reasons as to why they were in the same
01:34:31 universe and they all had like personality quirks and different interpretations based on how it was
01:34:37 the fucking nut your shit man I'm just like now that I look back on it I'm probably one of about
01:34:43 like a hundred people in total who ever gave a fuck about this you know what I mean like
01:34:49 it this this was something that on the internet that nobody would have given a fuck about well
01:34:53 see I'm right like Jimmy that leads me well into a into a point that I wanted to make about why I
01:34:58 got into 4chan and like okay like for me it because like 2008 or so was like the height of my like
01:35:06 I don't want to say dark web but like knowing I think we should yeah you should stop I think
01:35:10 we should all talk about how we all got into 4chan because those are all interesting stories
01:35:13 I don't know that Ben or Tom is particularly into 4chan but uh yeah I think I already kind of
01:35:19 said like I heard that it was a terrible place for terrible people I checked it out and read it
01:35:23 like a bit here and there I never really got that into it although I did kind of get into draw fag
01:35:29 threads on tg I talked about this in my interview I would someone drew me my dnd character on tg
01:35:34 and it was amazing and I hung around there and would like do a little sprite art of other people's
01:35:38 characters for a while uh so yeah for a while t I would go on tg once in a while but that was
01:35:44 about it for 4chan um well for me like because I had I had a I had like a friend who was a big
01:35:50 time 4chaner but he was like a beatard and he was like a you know troll who like liked 4chan for
01:35:55 the the insanity of it you know it's like I was familiar with 4chan mostly as like a place I would
01:36:01 never want to go because it was all going to be pictures of weird gross shit and I'd seen like
01:36:06 little like I'd seen people who did like 4chan pilgrimages and what they came back with and I'd
01:36:11 seen tub girl and that haunted my nightmares uh which for those who don't know was like a picture
01:36:16 of a woman in a bathtub like shitting piss out of her ass and just just go to ask jves and type what
01:36:22 is tub girl and then yeah uh and like and like shitting dick uh the classic shitting dick nipples
01:36:28 um which is exactly what it sounds like so like I always thought of 4chan as being like that but
01:36:33 then like at some point I found out about the anime board and that it was just a place where people
01:36:37 just fucking talk about anime and what's what I have always loved about 4chan is that you can find
01:36:45 someone who's into fucking anything you can think of like no matter how obscure your taste is someone
01:36:53 on there knows about it and so like I remember there was a time it was it was when a certain magical
01:37:00 index was airing and that show wasn't that popular at the time that it was it was relatively popular
01:37:05 but my favorite character was last order which is like this little lolly girl who is uh like the
01:37:10 lolly version of misaka who's the well-known character from the show and like I just really
01:37:14 wanted like fan art of last order and I go on like 4chan and start a thread about her and like
01:37:21 every piece of it that was in existence got posted there like all these people who like last order
01:37:25 were there and I was like nowhere else on the internet will I get this in no forum in no social
01:37:30 media site could I like bring up like maybe now I could because I'm like famous I could like bring
01:37:36 something up on Twitter and people would know what I'm talking about but like at the time
01:37:40 that was the only way I could have a conversation about this obscure thing and like
01:37:44 was last order the inspiration for dark holy uh no not no dark holy actually
01:37:51 was before her uh before last order but it's my naming convention is the same type of naming
01:37:58 it sounds like the same kind of name yeah it's also a lolly yeah mine was more influenced by like
01:38:05 everything I like has stupid names like you know a lot of the anime I've been into is like
01:38:10 weird naming conventions but anyway uh the the biggest one that I got into on 4chan was there's
01:38:16 this character called bico b i k k o and she was like she had one arm and one leg and one
01:38:24 eye I think and she was always smoking and she could play guitar and like for whatever reason
01:38:32 that just sounds like you know that whole thing about you were telling me about aesthetic persona
01:38:37 yeah that just sounds like the most fucking obscure aesthetic persona I've ever heard of
01:38:41 she was like what the thing is that she was a character from this dojinshi by uh like just a
01:38:48 self-published comic not like a porn one but it was just self-published comic by this guy called
01:38:52 romantic fool 1990 or something like that and uh he had published this comic with this character
01:39:00 in like the mid-2000s and no one could find this comic because apparently he had sold all the copies
01:39:09 including the master copy so he did not have it anymore and no one who had it was like I guess
01:39:16 willing to break the binding or just didn't realize that it had become like the character was
01:39:19 becoming a phenomenon but for whatever reason people had found out about the character design
01:39:24 and like the vague ideas of her backstory and like there was a lot of like art of her like with
01:39:29 like uh like marijuana iconography for some reason I've seen this character before yeah
01:39:36 she became popular on like guru chan because she's like a you know sort of a gourd character I guess
01:39:43 and like uh and so like every once in a while there'd be a threat about her and like she ended up
01:39:48 over time getting like tons of fan art just because people loved this character idea so much
01:39:54 that there was like all this all this fan art of bico and like people imagining what her situation
01:39:58 was like and stuff but like pretty early into that when there was just like a decent handful of stuff
01:40:03 then there was a threat about it on 4chan and I was like hey what if we organized making our own
01:40:10 dojinchi about bico and like you know incorporating all the elements we know about her and just like
01:40:16 do a daily life story and then there will be an actual bico story out there and like I actually
01:40:22 got people organized enough that we made an IRC channel and we were like planning it out
01:40:26 and I was gonna like we we had all these ideas did I ever come to anything like it came close
01:40:31 because I was gonna draw storyboards and then there was this artist girl who uh like offered to do
01:40:37 you know was gonna do the art and like she had drawn a bunch of like preliminary sketches and
01:40:41 stuff which looked kind of cool and like I had sent uh she had like a very distinct like scratchy
01:40:46 art style which I'm of course into but it wasn't like great but uh I had sent her the storyboards
01:40:51 and then she just never ended up finishing a page but it was like kind of a like a lot of people
01:40:56 knew about it and like people would keep coming back to the because I posted about it on my blog
01:41:00 and people would keep coming back they're like hey is this still a thing and I'm like nope but
01:41:04 eventually years down the line someone finally scanned the be the real uh comic but fun fact
01:41:12 that I found out like much later along the line the guy who did drew that comic is also the artist
01:41:18 of izuna legend of the unemployed ninja like those games hold up hold up because I just looked up
01:41:25 I just looked up because when you say these things and this is the great thing about the
01:41:28 internet nothing ever fucking dies right I just looked up bico and right after the her twitter
01:41:35 account is my blog it's it's this is bico and you can help us bring her to life my sword is
01:41:42 unbelievably dull.wordpress.co holy shit so yeah this is why the internet is great like you nothing
01:41:49 ever fucking dies right but that character is so obscure that like you know that there's probably
01:41:56 10 people who knew about her and I organized them all to try to make a comic but it it didn't come
01:42:01 to fruition but now that comic is out there and she's become like in the time since then the
01:42:06 character has become way more popular like there's there's fucking hundreds of fan arts of her out
01:42:10 there on on the subject of web comics when we were talking about this a little bit oh boy one of the
01:42:17 well one of the biggest like like key moments I think in in in where I've come to be in my place
01:42:26 on the internet I think looking back was uh control all delete oh okay I thought I thought you're
01:42:32 gonna say something else all right they're gonna bring where you I think I think I know what you
01:42:36 yeah they are bringing a different web comic that we've all I am gonna it's related okay okay because
01:42:43 I came to I can't all right I was on something awful I would browse the something awful forums
01:42:48 for a while in like I don't know 2010 or 2011 or something seems like a lot of the internet
01:42:53 came from there didn't the entire concept of let's plays originate from something awful
01:42:58 I think they did I think well okay the the four chain guy the reason why was yeah the reason why
01:43:05 something awful and fortune are both like oh wait something awful used to be a really big deal and
01:43:10 I think I think when I was on there was a little bit past its heyday but still they had these long
01:43:15 threads devoted entirely to hating on control all delete and every time control all delete came out
01:43:21 with a new comic people would post the new comic everyone would just page in pages of shitting
01:43:26 on it talking about how terrible the new punchline was and how and how terrible the art was and like
01:43:32 rewriting it and reconfiguring it and just redoing the whole thing to try and make it a little good
01:43:37 try and see how the author fucked up and how they could maybe undo the terrible terrible crime
01:43:42 come back sorry I okay cool um anyway I would browse these threads all the time and just look
01:43:49 at this fucking asshole artist and then hate on him and people would talk about other shitty
01:43:54 artists and of course uh sonichu and christian western chairman always got into sonichu yeah
01:44:01 though those control all delete hate threads were how I got into sonichu oh man uh and
01:44:07 you know I guess that's the end of the story no but another the weird thing is the weird thing is
01:44:11 like like the reason why a lot of the internet came from both fortune and something awful I think
01:44:19 it's because for a long time when you know how everyone had heard of like new grounds fortune
01:44:26 something awful back in the day like everyone had heard of those places so because everyone had
01:44:31 heard of those places or a lot of the people who were inclined to be at the forefront of
01:44:37 dare I say internet culture were the people who perused these places so so not through well not
01:44:45 through the basis of the fact that I'll continue I was gonna say I guess because I think did you
01:44:51 said before nowadays the internet is all about places that aggregate constantly yeah so I guess
01:44:56 like before there were formal places like for that like youtube and and stuff uh and maybe tumblr
01:45:03 or something I mean for like forums like that and for chan and maybe new grounds and stuff
01:45:08 were places where you could go to find lots of stuff all in one place yeah that was that was kind
01:45:13 of that was kind of the thing so like and all the creative people who would happen to be there would
01:45:18 would end up making these things and those things would be shared aromatically and they would become
01:45:22 in in and of themselves like the troll face for example those things would in and of themselves
01:45:26 just become just like things that get shared repeatedly and just spread all across and it
01:45:31 was just some random fucking drawing some dude made for a thread sometime that I guarantee you the
01:45:37 guy who made the quote unquote troll face did not did not like think to themselves I'm going to turn
01:45:42 this into a worldwide phenomenon with this like he fucking drew a random ass weird like annoying
01:45:48 little face that he thought was funny and just posted it and people thought it was funny and
01:45:52 kept posting it that's I feel like that's the reason why that's the reason why the idea of a forced
01:45:57 meme is so annoying to some people because memes in and of themselves are supposed to be kind of
01:46:02 pure like that's another important part of the internet like a meme is supposed to be a thing
01:46:08 that just happens it's supposed to spark like wildfire like things don't just things spring up
01:46:13 out the ether and just now everyone's talking about it the the reason why I had to tell that
01:46:19 control alt delete hate thread story and like the the point of that is that like getting into
01:46:25 sonichu was like like sonichu and chris wesson channel it was like a huge it was an entire
01:46:30 chapter of my internet life like for like for like over a year I was on the sonichu forums like
01:46:36 or the on the sonichu wiki like monitoring this guy's life and monitoring all the developments
01:46:41 of the son I was of the sonichu fandom for lack of a better word like I was I was deep I was deep
01:46:48 fucking in to that shit oh my goodness gracious um I don't know I just I just had to say that
01:46:54 because I wanted people to know that like that's the point the point is that this was a full a
01:46:59 full chapter the I even tried I even I even got into amateur game development I started making
01:47:05 I started making an rpg maker game and I did tons and tons of sprite art for a game that I never
01:47:10 even got close to finishing that was going to be based on his life it was called christian
01:47:14 weston chandler's adult chronicles uh yep I definitely like that's a sad chapter of my
01:47:23 there's a big part of me that like really misses the the feeling of like going out in the internet
01:47:28 and finding something that was just not like anything else because like I think that because
01:47:34 we've centralized everything now where it's like you've got youtube facebook twitter tumblr uh you
01:47:40 know and then like a few other social media type sites like I think that on the one hand
01:47:45 it's allowed us to like perfect a lot of the content and like make stuff that's better than
01:47:49 it's ever been before but I also think it necessarily like pushes everyone to making
01:47:54 stuff that's kind of the same like everyone tailored to what that's kind of tailored towards
01:47:59 you know that's actually makes sense because one of one of my friends I think you guys know him
01:48:03 his name's Elijah uh like you know Elijah's a guy who just he's he's uh uh remember that video I
01:48:10 posted where the guy it was just a guy on the phone sending me a bunch of yeah it was that if
01:48:14 that's my friend Elijah that is that guy the guy with the really shitty opinions so I remember
01:48:19 Elijah was trying to get me into the anime world order podcast and they're a really great podcast
01:48:25 and I was explaining to him like why I had never gotten into them recently because I didn't read
01:48:31 them I didn't like listen to them back in the day and I didn't listen to them now because they're
01:48:35 not on YouTube and I told them that that's like that's exactly why I haven't started I've known
01:48:40 about anime order for 10 years and I've never listened to it because back in the day I didn't
01:48:45 know what a podcast was and like how to actually listen to it and then and like the guy I had
01:48:51 always I had always heard that they were like very like anti moe type guys you know and I was like
01:48:57 really into moe back then so like I was kind of like oh fuck those guys and then like over time
01:49:02 I was like man they're still going that's that's probably like one of the best anime shows on the
01:49:07 I'm willing to bet these guys really know their stuff more than anybody else these guys these guys
01:49:12 like no like I listen to I've listened to a couple of them ever since Elijah wouldn't fucking stop
01:49:16 telling me to go listen to them and to be honest listening to them has filled me with almost as
01:49:22 much knowledge as fucking listening to just you talk or like listening to what listening to
01:49:26 Elijah's or listen to some other friend Darryl Soret is a part of that podcast right yeah Darryl Soret
01:49:31 is like he's the head guy I mean Darryl Soret's a guy who for anyone or audience who doesn't know
01:49:36 about him not only has he been an anime blogger forever he has more knowledge about anything
01:49:40 than anyone else in the world he runs like a million panels at like at anime conventions like
01:49:45 every year at Otacon there will be like a ton of Darryl Soret panels and I make a point to go to
01:49:49 those because they are by far the most interesting panels there in terms of just like breadth of
01:49:53 knowledge uh and he also writes for Otaku USA he even knows about pro wrestling yeah he even knows
01:49:58 about fucking pro wrestling and it's crazy he writes for Otaku USA which is like the only
01:50:03 still running anime magazine in the US and he writes for like anime news network sometimes
01:50:08 he's really he's written articles for so many places and I was telling him that he's not on
01:50:12 YouTube yeah that's the craziest thing like he's not like I was telling Elijah he's not on YouTube
01:50:18 so I haven't listened to him and Elijah was furious at this concept because and it's it's
01:50:23 kind of based on what you just said earlier because Elijah is much older than me and Elijah's been on
01:50:29 the internet for a lot long well he's been on the internet as deeper than I have for a lot longer
01:50:34 and he is still in that mindset of there's a billion different places where you get a billion
01:50:39 different things and Elijah he can't fucking fathom why somebody would shut out another part
01:50:45 just because they're not on this site because he's like I mean
01:50:51 right yeah like I like I mean in fairness I have gone out of my way for biggest problem in the
01:50:56 universe like I go to the website and now both hosts have their own shows that I go to their
01:51:00 websites for that but like with anime world order it's also that it's been running for so long
01:51:05 that it's like it's daunting to think about the idea that like because you know even if it's not
01:51:10 a sequential podcast there's gotta be a million memes and inside jokes and stuff that they
01:51:15 talk about regularly well I've listened to a couple of them I've listened to a couple of them I
01:51:21 didn't really I listened to the one about initial D which has taught me more about initial D than
01:51:25 I've ever actually wanted to know right but like like it isn't really like that but I can I feel
01:51:33 like if I listen to a few more I definitely get that like for example if for example the first
01:51:38 person what if someone was picking this podcast for the first time will not know what well late is
01:51:43 yeah they will all teach them like oh yeah Ben could definitely teach them how to be well laid
01:51:50 or they probably don't get why we keep saying patreon.com slash ben saint or yeah
01:51:57 they don't need to know why they just need to they just need to go there and and pledge they just
01:52:02 need to repeat repeat it over and over again I think I probably am using oh why did you say
01:52:06 simultaneously all the time that's a that's a very inside meme that nobody really knows I think
01:52:12 that I am probably legitimately I think my life has probably been markedly worse all this time
01:52:19 because I haven't been listening to anime world order and I feel like it would probably improve
01:52:24 my entire life to listen to it but if I feel like it would like they are like they're a really good
01:52:30 anime podcast I think actually I think the real reason I haven't listened is that I'm afraid of how
01:52:35 stupid I'll feel for not having listened to them when I first found out about them in like 2007
01:52:40 and I'll feel so bad that I didn't know talking about talking about web comics and podcasts oh boy
01:52:48 here's an internet thing penny arcade definitely everyone knows penny arcade in my opinion it
01:52:53 kind of sucks and isn't very funny I agree but they have a podcast and sometimes when they're when
01:53:00 they record themselves thinking of the comic and they're like they're they're banter with each other
01:53:07 and their conversations about like what's going on in gaming news and like what's going on in their
01:53:11 lives as they're thinking of the comic and writing the comic is is awesome it's so great I can't
01:53:19 even though I don't recommend anyone read penny arcade but I highly recommend everyone listen to
01:53:24 the penny arcade podcast it is gaban i don't know gaban taiko are like two of my favorite dudes
01:53:30 to listen to because just wicked fun actually that's how she that's how she gonna suck they're
01:53:34 such cool guys they seem a way cooler than like because the characters in penny arcade seem like
01:53:40 total douchebags and like penny arcade is so much worse than them I don't understand because it
01:53:45 comes from that era it comes from an era when like web comic characters were usually thinly
01:53:50 veiled versions of the real people so you see those characters and you're like these guys must
01:53:55 be total douchebags but then they are not like their characters really yeah I think there is some
01:54:00 element of that like the format is just outdated but like it's just what they do so they're not
01:54:05 gonna change it it's the old is the old tim buckley control out delete style like fucking I mean I
01:54:11 I mean that's a whole another level I mean penny arcade is the worst web I'm sorry not penny arcade
01:54:16 control out delete is the worst penny arcade is just kind of mediocre and not very funny
01:54:22 but okay and that actually brings me to another chapter of my fucking internet existence I remember
01:54:27 one time like I was on vacation in Nigeria and my dad took me to Abuja which is the capital where
01:54:33 one of my childhood friends stayed and he was a huge fan of Tegua Tig that guy with the glasses
01:54:42 yeah I had sure and he introduced me to the nostalgia critic and he introduced me to a
01:54:48 bunch of other content creators like Linkara and you know just a bunch of that guy that dude in
01:54:54 the suede all all all of those people so I became a fan through him and I started watching a lot of
01:55:01 nostalgia critic and that that again was another like window into another chapter of the internet
01:55:08 like people people talk about Tegua Tig now like it was a weird otherworldly thing but people need
01:55:14 to understand it still seems like a yeah no but that like for better for worse for a long time
01:55:22 in internet content creation that was the that was the golden ticket that was the high water
01:55:27 yes and and I gotta say it's really lowered the bar for everyone yeah because of because of how
01:55:34 shit they are everyone else thinks it's okay to be that shit and the terrible thing is it's true
01:55:40 because that's what people accept because they were because they were the first big collective
01:55:45 to get to that point people have just been like oh if it's as good as Tegua Tig then I can I could
01:55:51 run with it they were the first ones to do it so they didn't have to do it well but that established
01:55:57 the go the standard as you don't have to do it well and then so then it then like another if you
01:56:03 can't tell I kind I kind of hate Tegua Tig oh no no no I think we all do I think it's like no no no
01:56:08 okay I think the PCP can absolutely go to war with Tegua Tig because I think we all hate them
01:56:14 to me to me is genuinely an actual personal gripes issue because I I really hate Jesu Otaku
01:56:21 like personal this is on a personal level me and her I mean me and him I think since he's he
01:56:26 him is now a guy it's complicated like it's I don't yeah like I despise that entire group
01:56:34 same as I know I know that Jeff was a big fan of of Jesu Otaku and like that inspired him to
01:56:42 make videos both of us both of us hate them both of us hate her now because she inspired both of
01:56:47 us she inspired both of us on how on to on making youtube videos my inspirations for youtube actually
01:56:54 were movie bob gigak who's now one of my close friends yeah movie bob gigak extra credits zero
01:57:00 punctuation and Jesu Otaku those are like the people those are like the things that push me on
01:57:04 how to make content now make content that's like nothing like I just want to say I know that like
01:57:09 I know that there was a time when Jesu Otaku was a big deal because of the fact that like
01:57:14 she was the she was the only person doing anime videos it was her and gigak it was her and gigak
01:57:19 who was the only person doing anime reviews on youtube and everyone liked the deck out the
01:57:24 glass of style but as someone who only found her later like I was you know it relatively early
01:57:29 into getting into internet videos someone like was like oh what about Jesu Otaku and like I watched
01:57:34 like her last like review and I was like this is fucking terrible like yeah everything I would
01:57:39 not want her attitude the smarmy attitude she had about anime the dismissiveness over like
01:57:46 yes fan service elements and sage who is the ugliest man who's ever decided to show his face
01:57:51 on camera and has the longest opinions in the world okay you see he was he was a guest in the video
01:57:57 that there's a there's a there's footage right you know who gigak is you know gunt right gunt went
01:58:03 to alcon which is a convention in england and a bunch of that guy with the glasses people were there
01:58:08 and sage was doing a live showing of his Evangelion review and the camera pans towards gunt and you
01:58:16 can just see the death in his like the death glare he's giving sage
01:58:21 i didn't see what's amazing for those who don't know sage is like infamous for the fact that he
01:58:27 really hates end of Evangelion and like has like he has this whole like position on it i guess that
01:58:34 is just like entirely wrong like he just and also doesn't okay okay so basically basically he is
01:58:42 when i say i like to use the term second boomer a lot right like did you's heard me say a lot
01:58:48 when i say second boomer i mean people who grew up who grew up on anime in the second boom which is
01:58:52 the early 90s where they got stuff like a quira ghost in the shell all the cool sci-fi stuff
01:58:58 and sage fashions himself he he builds himself up as that kind of person oh i only talk about
01:59:03 90s anime i'm pretty sure he's too young to even have been around yeah like i only talk about 90s
01:59:10 anime i only talk about like the action stuff and all that and power to you i like action stuff too
01:59:15 but the way he approaches it and the way he talks about modern anime as if there's nothing good
01:59:20 coming out now like he's he's one of those people yeah one of the that he's one of the anime stuff
01:59:25 he's a relic from an era like there was a point because this is what for chan was when i first
01:59:30 got into a for chan was constant fighting over whether anime was going to shit because there was
01:59:37 the whole like anime fans from the 90s and and early 2000s were really like genre fans like
01:59:43 there were people who were into anime because it was sci-fi and action and had all these masculine
01:59:48 things and so when anime became like they started having all these cute girls and stuff this is
01:59:52 where we get people like that anime snob who like despises modern anime even though it's just base
01:59:57 it's not anime has gotten no worse in terms of quality the problem is that it's just a yeah it's
02:00:02 different the genres are different yeah it used to be that there was a lot of sci-fi and now
02:00:08 sci-fi is not an interesting genre anymore because we all understand now now now we're in
02:00:13 now we're in the fantasy era yeah we're kind of in the fantasy era and like and so it just
02:00:18 so happened the genres changed and like so during the that the period where that change was happening
02:00:24 anime fandom was nothing but people arguing over whether anime was going to shit that's all it was
02:00:29 the whole late 2000s was just people arguing about whether or not moe was good or shit and
02:00:36 like i don't think anime discourse really made any progress at the time like that's why
02:00:41 like people look at someone like me coming out now and like my stuff seems so much more like
02:00:47 heady than most of what people have gotten because for so long anime has just been literally arguing
02:00:52 over whether or not something is even good not like explaining why it's good which is interesting
02:00:58 but you know just like arguing over the quality of shows because the old guard of anime fans feel
02:01:03 like has such a different taste in genres from the new and even i didn't i didn't necessarily
02:01:07 understand how to discuss that like this is a weird tangent but like we'll get back on top but
02:01:11 like i didn't know how to discuss that that's why i have this really odd video on my channel
02:01:15 called the importance of animation and it's a stupid video but one thing i do pride on my
02:01:21 younger self is that even back then i knew that we were in a wrong headed place when it came
02:01:27 to discussing anime like when every time somebody will talk about an action scene they'll say oh it
02:01:32 has good animation or it has bad animation fuck it talk about what makes it good or bad right talk
02:01:37 about talk about the camera angles talk about like talk about the aesthetic of it talk about what it
02:01:41 makes you feel talk about how justify your opinion like what this justify your opinion and like none
02:01:46 of that was coming through in any of the even of the people i really liked even of the people at
02:01:50 the time even though now i really don't follow their content anymore so guys like glass reflections
02:01:55 guys like uh jesso taku as we had mentioned earlier even though i used to be huge fans of
02:01:59 them back then they didn't fucking talk about any of that and they would just like give her like
02:02:04 look at how dumb this show is it's it's it's dumb it's not good jessel taku jessel taku every
02:02:12 now and then every now and then she would let her film school side she would let her film school
02:02:16 side show and she would get into a little bit of that like in her black cat review she talks
02:02:21 hold on jimmy we're getting too deep into your rules here
02:02:26 fuck okay okay so fine let me let me get back i think we should probably be wrapping this up
02:02:32 soon because i think we're getting pretty close to the end here's here's my here's my take on all
02:02:36 of this here's my here's my closing thoughts anime shit or not shit we'll have plenty of time to
02:02:43 sort it out after our after our beautiful white western god smites japan with holy fire and lightning
02:02:54 for the terrible sin of creating fully kooli too wow oh god we still don't i i i'm still like in that
02:03:03 denial stage where i don't believe fully kooli too will really happen like until oh it's happening
02:03:08 it's happening it won't it will it will because japan will be nothing but a smoldering crater
02:03:14 really because because the righteous a righteous god would not let you know the sad thing is that i
02:03:19 have now seen evidence that it will happen because i watched the first episode of the new berserk
02:03:24 anime and after that no travesty is too farfetched like i've been i've been i've been i've been
02:03:33 sending my righteous prayers my righteous prayers every night have reached his holy
02:03:40 oh by the way by the way before we get back on track like we need to do we need to do a week
02:03:45 are we being out on the fucking new season because oh yeah this this new berserk is gonna be is
02:03:50 definitely gonna be a point is gonna be a point to touch on but yeah okay back on my internet story
02:03:55 i'm gonna zoom through it now because i'm gonna go from the 2010s up until now all right so
02:04:00 2011 is an important year in my life one of the most important years like 2011 is like the
02:04:05 keystone in my life forever june 18th 20 june 18th 2011 was the day i first set foot in america
02:04:14 to start living here and at that point i obviously at that point i was i was about 16 so i was of
02:04:22 the age where i understood how the internet worked i nothing that i know in terms of how to maneuver
02:04:28 the internet has changed in that time but the one thing that has changed is my attitude towards
02:04:35 the things i see because now i'm much i'm much more open to interacting with other people
02:04:42 which opened up an entirely new dimension in terms of like just the internet in general which
02:04:48 like which could even be its own other podcast in terms of internet friends like that that i've
02:04:53 proposed to other people but like the idea of going on the internet meeting people talking to
02:04:59 them about stuff that you're into which is stuff that you guys had been doing much you know much
02:05:04 earlier than i did but something that i had only been doing up until like fairly recently within
02:05:09 the last five years and it kind of made me understand opinions a bit differently because
02:05:16 back when i was younger i didn't have like i would watch anime and i just i just be like i like this i
02:05:21 don't like this there was nobody who i could share that opinion with like i had no like growing up
02:05:27 in Ghana i had no friends who watched anime the closest i had were like this one dude who like
02:05:32 Naruto when i was in boarding school and my cousins who live in america who i would see like once
02:05:38 every two years and who know who i now live with but like my cousins who live in america made fun
02:05:43 of me for my name yeah i went over to their house for christmas one year and i and i put on like
02:05:47 tsunami or something i was watching raroni kenshin oh boy and they were like dude what are you
02:05:52 watching dude these these are just cartoons for japanese people or whatever and i was like you
02:05:57 you stupid baka gaijin scum oh you don't understand the majesty of the japanese animation folded a
02:06:05 thousand times longer and gaming and gaming oh that was me another important another important
02:06:15 part of how i've started to interact with the internet is torrenting video games because torrenting
02:06:20 video like torrenting anime was one thing torrenting video games is a new dimension man yeah like
02:06:26 the level to the level of video games i've played within the last five years has increased
02:06:30 exponentially not just because of stuff like that you can get on your computer through emulators
02:06:36 through like just a bunch of different means i've been i've played games because of the internet
02:06:41 i've played games now that i would have never been able to play as a kid because i had a pal ps2
02:06:47 i had a pal ps2 and ntsc games wouldn't work on them meaning games bought from america wouldn't
02:06:51 work on my ps2 so now i've been able to open up my entire i feel like i feel like how old people
02:06:57 feel when they're able to like when they have a bunch of money and they can just spend money on
02:07:02 shit that they couldn't do as kids right i feel like that oh yeah i feel like that now as like as
02:07:07 like an early that's how dude i you know my first console was the n64 and i never had a ps1
02:07:14 and i got a ps2 late so like everything before the ps2 era of gaming like i only got into because
02:07:22 of emulators like i'd never touched like a super nintendo and now i've played like probably 100
02:07:27 super nintendo games as a result of emulation that's another really important facet of the
02:07:33 internet being able to get stuff that you couldn't possibly have even come close to getting
02:07:39 in any other means while you're growing up that's one reason why the internet is like amazing and
02:07:44 another another really important facet of the internet is news like we get news now i get all
02:07:49 my news from twitter yeah what you guys never watch the news but i i usually find out what's
02:07:55 like if something's going on eventually like if it's something mainstream happening like
02:08:01 Guillermo del Toro is going to tweet about it and i'll find out about it from him because he does
02:08:05 a lot of like relief effort tweeting and if it's more like political than all the fucking uh
02:08:10 like liberals i follow will tweet about it if i if i see someone tweeting news i fucking mute him
02:08:18 i don't care because i don't want i don't want that shit in my life my dad my dad is a my dad's
02:08:23 an like i don't want to say this because it's gonna sound weird but my dad's an intellectual
02:08:27 right he's one of those kinds of people he he loves to read he he's written books that's not
02:08:31 weird that's that's cool yeah he's he's written books he's uh he's done he's done talks and stuff
02:08:36 he even has a TED talk online if you i'm not gonna tell anyone to find it uh but like he
02:08:42 what's what's it about it's about it's about the difference between it's about the inter-correlation
02:08:46 between uh activism and politics and political between political activism and political action
02:08:52 whether or not they're intertwined dude my dad's a politician it doesn't matter but like uh
02:08:56 he when when he was when he was uh when every time i would when i was living with him he would
02:09:01 always buy newspapers every morning every on the way to school on the way to school we'd always
02:09:06 stop by a newspaper stand and he'd always buy one and i'll be like why does that always buy
02:09:11 newspapers like why does he need newspapers all the fucking time and because he didn't have read
02:09:15 it yeah and then now that i'm older i i'm like the first thing i do when i wake up is i check
02:09:20 kamatsu for gaming news i check twitter for like my life for just stuff i have all other stuff i
02:09:25 check crunch roll news i check anime news network then i start perusing like youtube to see if anyone
02:09:29 was made in videos about current events then i start looking through the you know internet just
02:09:33 to see regular current events and i'm like fuck i have become my father yeah like through the internet
02:09:39 i have become my father i i go to reddit and i go to r slash the procrastinators to see who's posted
02:09:45 new shit and that's that's my news and then i'm done i i want to jump on something you said a
02:09:50 minute ago jimmy just briefly because you were talking about learning about like other people
02:09:54 having opinions and stuff and yeah like for me because like i said i started on forums which is
02:09:59 all about you know different people sharing their opinions and what eventually drove me off of forums
02:10:04 because i have absolutely no interest in that kind of thing anymore um is the realization that i didn't
02:10:10 care about anyone else's opinions and that other people didn't care enough about my opinions because
02:10:16 like we'd have a thread about a new show like a new episode comes out and like i'd post in the thread
02:10:22 and then no one would actually respond to my post everyone was just sharing their thoughts on the
02:10:27 episode and i was like well i wanted to talk about like my impressions i didn't want to just hear
02:10:33 everyone's impressions with no one responding to each other so then that's why like i got really
02:10:38 into my anime blog because if i wrote about an episode on there then the comments were only
02:10:44 gonna be about my reaction to the episode and like discussing the points i've brought up so
02:10:49 eventually i just felt like i wasn't getting anything out of forums and i was getting everything
02:10:53 out of blogging and that's why i just totally moved in that direction and never looked back
02:10:59 like i've never gone i think forums are fucking pointless now like even like you know somewhere
02:11:04 like our anime like they have halfway decent discussions but it's about uh like specifically
02:11:10 if it's one of my videos getting posted up there then it's a discussion of my video whereas
02:11:15 there's no way i would jump in on like you know new episode of the show is out let's all discuss it
02:11:20 because they have those posts on there and i'm like no i don't fucking care like it's too broad
02:11:26 you know i'd rather talk about my own opinions so yeah my sear my sheer self-centeredness drove
02:11:31 me off of forums and it drove you into making youtube videos oh boy like i mean the reason i
02:11:38 got driven like into using the internet for like content creation it was kind of because
02:11:45 well okay it was it was kind of because through internet videos i felt like i was learning how
02:11:50 to make them i was like i learned how not to make internet videos through that guy with the glasses
02:11:55 i learned i got my start on learning how to make internet videos with this one video that
02:12:00 gantt put out called oh so you want to be a content creator and he made he just gives
02:12:04 these really brief introduction i was like just write a script basically what it boils down to is
02:12:09 write a script record the audio find a video editor put the footage in there and release the video
02:12:14 and to be honest if you want to get into video making write a script record the audio put that's
02:12:21 that that is really the bare bones of what we do and that kind of is what like learning that kind
02:12:27 of stuff from the internet brought me to where i am today and it's it's kind of crazy to think
02:12:34 all the stuff i've learned every single part of the internet that i've learned is now kind of like
02:12:39 my little weird it's kind of like my little weird like background and you know education on how to
02:12:46 do youtube because all the stuff i've done like from torrenting anime uh look at all led us up to
02:12:52 this it all led us up to this point like using the internet to research information all that stuff
02:12:57 yeah we gotta we gotta start wrapping this up tom you said you had something you wanted a question
02:13:01 you wanted to present when you got back right yeah it's kind of crazy because we used it feels
02:13:06 and this sounds really like edgy if you if you want to put it this way but like all of us grew up in
02:13:11 the wild west all of us grew up in the wild west of the internet like it was it was not in any way
02:13:18 safe it was not in any way less like it was way more decentralized something that i have found
02:13:23 something that i found disturbing is like i'll find like i i tend to like content that's not
02:13:30 like you know like whitewashed right like i don't i don't expect to necessarily always even agree
02:13:35 with everything i'm seeing but like i enjoy a lot of stuff like musically right like music is still
02:13:42 pretty out there and the new releases will come out that are totally weird and abrasive and interesting
02:13:47 and like whenever i hear something like that i'm always like man you could not do this on youtube
02:13:55 like you could not have a career of making something that's totally out there because
02:14:00 no one will find you people will only like people come to youtube for very specific things and when
02:14:05 they click on your videos they have very specific expectations you want you want to know the crazy
02:14:09 thing it's kind of like to speak on that youtube thing like even though you guys probably haven't
02:14:14 been making content on youtube like you got you guys started a right like doing a bunch of pony
02:14:20 stuff right but and around that time yeah i'm sorry i'm not supposed to bring that up well i started
02:14:26 no no 2007 personally doing like weird videos but yeah so like but the thing is back back then to
02:14:34 make to get someone over i mean to get someone you know like a bet a bigger channel like to put
02:14:41 someone up you know at the same level you were to like promote someone else was a lot easier
02:14:46 because there were video responses if you if someone you're someone you'll subscribe to you see
02:14:51 what they're liking and you see what what they're commenting on other people's videos so then it's
02:14:55 like oh what is it what's he doing i want to see what he's doing now youtube has kind of gotten rid
02:15:00 of all that and kind of streamlined it so that only the people who are already big or can get big
02:15:05 easily based on very easily digestible content stay big and get shown which is kind of probably
02:15:12 you know is a kind of weird tom what's the rest of your question is there more we'll continue
02:15:16 to yeah i that's what that's what that's what fortune that's what fortune tries to be yeah fortune
02:15:22 tries to retain some of that chaos huge rubber banding effect where like because especially
02:15:27 for people who are making like the weird or stuff who are gonna start like being like i don't want
02:15:33 to be on youtube anymore and there are like a lot of audiences will follow you know i think that if
02:15:39 i think that um people who have large audiences when they migrate like they stand to lose a huge
02:15:47 amount of their audience but they will still bring a lot of people with them and they will those people
02:15:53 will move and they will change the way their attitudes are about stuff and i think that
02:15:58 like there's gonna be a point where uh you know like for me personally i have a a fairly sizable
02:16:06 audience but not nearly enough that i can take huge risks with it you know like i can post i can
02:16:12 post whatever weird shit i want on my digiroctor dark channel and people won't complain too much
02:16:16 unless i was to go on like some weird racist tirade or something like that most of the stuff i do
02:16:22 online is not going to have a major effect on me but like if i had a like a really huge audience
02:16:28 the kind where i could cut off 90 percent of it and i'd still be like like imagine if i had
02:16:34 10 times the subs i had now and then but i only need the amount that i have now then alienating
02:16:41 90 percent of my audience is no longer a problem and so as long as i feel like i can carry 10 percent
02:16:48 of it then i could go wherever i want and do whatever i want and i would feel comfortable with
02:16:52 that and i think that that's the kind of stuff that like if i got to that level and i wanted to
02:16:57 do something really different and i was like you know what youtube is too strict and what it allows
02:17:02 me to do i want to you know launch my own platform and do my own unique art that's not like what the
02:17:09 youtube formula is then i would do that and i would carry whatever small percentage of my audience
02:17:15 i can with me and go off to do this other thing and i think that we might start seeing that if
02:17:20 like if a channel with a million subs is like hey youtube is too restrictive and i want to do
02:17:27 something a little different then let's all go over here and you know enough people will follow them
02:17:32 i mean i don't know how long do you think it would take for google to buy it out
02:17:36 before what how long do you think how long do you think it would take before google buys it out
02:17:40 well i mean i'm not talking about like making a new youtube like i think we'll see more people
02:17:45 just making their own websites again you know like we'll go back to having a that guy with the
02:17:50 glasses collective or i mean a lot of those people they still have the website infrastructure there
02:17:57 like you know like john shran's group like normal boots you know like there's this whole
02:18:00 group called normal boots they have their own website with their own video hosting but
02:18:04 nobody goes there because everyone's on youtube but if those if john shran packed up his bags and
02:18:09 said i'm leaving youtube i'm going to post my stuff on normal boots fuck youtube then like
02:18:16 he'll lose a huge amount of his audience but he has so many viewers that he can still you know he
02:18:21 could still live off of it even if people like even if he was forcing people to go to another site
02:18:26 and like well i mean a lot i think i think someone like i think someone like yms that will happen
02:18:33 like when yms gets big enough because he's he's fairly big he's got like 400 000 subs if yms ever
02:18:39 got to a point where he was making enough money and had a big enough following that he could
02:18:43 justifiably leave youtube he would do it in a fucking heartbeat because he hates youtube and
02:18:48 he'd be will he'd be like oh i've got enough audience yeah exactly yeah
02:18:57 right i mean i've said this before all the time where like i'm like there's a lot of like i don't
02:19:02 care that much if my videos don't make it onto youtube because that's not where my money comes
02:19:07 from and like i've had times where like a video got blocked and i'm like all right well i'm gonna
02:19:12 put it on daily motion give it to my patrons and then you know fight fight the claim on youtube till
02:19:18 the video comes back but as long as i'm making the money it doesn't matter where it is you know as
02:19:22 long as my patrons can find it so i really think that is what's going to eventually
02:19:27 demit like when when youtube gets to a point where it keeps enforcing these new rules and like
02:19:32 in some ways youtube's getting better they're trying to they're trying to make copyright
02:19:36 better for people but i think that if youtube ever fucks us over everyone's gonna just fucking leave
02:19:41 everyone with a big enough audience is just gonna take off and go be a patreon somewhere
02:19:45 yeah that actually that actually does sound like a genuine like a genuine like uh evolution
02:19:54 evolutionary step that the internet is gonna take well i feel like we're a bit far off from it at
02:19:58 this point like because right now i feel like we are in the golden age of youtube it just depends
02:20:03 on if things get really bad like if the censorship stuff gets like crushingly bad then people will
02:20:08 leave if they start telling us that we have to release videos on youtube red or like content
02:20:13 creators if they want to make money have to release on youtube red that would be nah that like
02:20:18 i would quit then i mean i would i would love to be off youtube not even for any like particularly
02:20:24 logical reasons other than just i want autonomy like i really value that personally like being
02:20:30 able to have control over all my that's why i've never joined like an mcn or anything like that you
02:20:34 know i mean yeah that's another that's another thing i'm trying i'm trying to get out of my mcn
02:20:40 trying to get out of my mcn right now i'm trying to like leave but apparently something that they
02:20:45 didn't put in the fine print because they said you can leave anytime you want but then what they
02:20:48 actually meant was that you can leave anytime you want when your contract when your contract
02:20:52 runs out and they never they never tell you when your contract fucking runs out so what i had to
02:20:57 learn i sent an email can i fucking leave now and then not obviously not in those words because
02:21:02 i'm actually trying to leave i don't want them to like eliminate my account but like they'll like
02:21:06 they'll like oh yeah you can leave on december 30th and i'm just like wow fuck you like seriously
02:21:12 lawyer up dog don't you doesn't your dad know some lawyers or something you could get on that
02:21:17 oh man i don't think it's like a big deal i feel like it's not it's not that big of a deal right
02:21:21 now like i'll wait i'll wait till december and just leave them yeah like trying to file suit against
02:21:27 them would probably take at least well i mean i think like threatening to file a suit against
02:21:32 probably get them to just be like all right that's that's fair yeah depending on what network it is
02:21:38 yeah and uh yeah i've already fucked youtube i've already i've already taken my huge following
02:21:44 and just and just fucked right off to the black boy that is saintcomics.com and youtube will never
02:21:50 be the same and like youtube will never stop feeling that loss there's something to me is very
02:21:54 precious about like like precious and like like a legit not precious like in a condescending way
02:22:00 but precious like legitimately not precious like the movie there's something very precious to me
02:22:04 about when i get to go to like saintcomics.com or uh tom what was your fucking site called again
02:22:12 sorcerousloss.com what else would it be called well you barely ever update the damn thing so i
02:22:18 haven't had a lot of cause to i have gone there like five times and read through those same six
02:22:24 pages again but um i mean i mean i mean i'm always going to mspainadventures.com yeah i used to go
02:22:31 there you know that's the home of homes like there's no there's nowhere else to go for that you know
02:22:34 if i type the letter t into my browser then it either auto completes twitter or the biggest
02:22:40 problem in the universe or now i'm trying to convince it to send me to the dick show instead
02:22:45 because the biggest problem isn't a fucking website anymore and uh or you know the maddox network i
02:22:50 really like that i like being able to go to a website and it has its own feel and look to it
02:22:57 sorcerousloss is a beautiful website um it's weird because it's weird because it's it's almost the
02:23:03 opposite for me because i've been seeing all these content creators that i used to follow on
02:23:09 multiple different sites for example i used to follow movie bob i used to follow extra credits i
02:23:13 used to follow yatsi and now they're all on youtube now they're all i've never i have never
02:23:19 watched yatsi on youtube i go to the escapist i have it on my yeah i've had the escapist is like
02:23:24 the third bookmark on my bar because i watch it every single week for like because i because i
02:23:30 always remember that like i always remember that the escapist always was a they always recently
02:23:35 they let their youtube videos be a week behind but i think they let their videos catch up recently
02:23:41 i i i don't care about that it's just like a thing for me that like i've been watching it on
02:23:46 the escapist all this time and that feels right and i also sometimes would go and read like critical
02:23:50 miss or something uh while i'm on there but also something like a quick thing like i used to go
02:23:55 to the escapist and the entire weekly content schedule would be full now you go to the escapist
02:24:00 and it's just they fired everybody they fired everybody i used to while i was on the site i'd
02:24:06 watch uh yatsi i'd watch movie bob's both of his shows sometimes i'd watch jimquisition and like
02:24:12 those guys are all gone now but anyway i guess uh and they haven't hired anyone new yeah we're
02:24:17 wrapping up i'd run a week i'd run a weekly animation if i yeah no i thought about that i
02:24:24 thought about pitching myself to the escapist before back when i was like not sure if i wanted to be
02:24:28 uh indy forever um yeah but yeah so that's our podcast that's how we became net savvy i guess uh
02:24:36 and you should too i i guess
02:24:43 i'm a little bit concerned that in this world of homogenized information and everyone going
02:24:49 to the same websites that it doesn't teach people as much about how to like navigate the internet
02:24:54 and i i do like even though i think fourchan or a bunch of douchebags about their no spoon feeding
02:24:59 policy because they take it too too much of an extreme i do think it's a great lesson that like
02:25:04 if you go on fourchan and someone posts a picture and you say source then they're going to fucking
02:25:09 look at you like an idiot because you can reverse image search you just right click on an image and
02:25:13 click search google for this image and it will find you what that image is and like if you go on fourchan
02:25:19 for five minutes you're gonna learn that because everyone holds to it so strongly but if you don't
02:25:24 then you might never know and there's so much more faggot like i can find anything on the internet
02:25:30 because i've been given the tools and when i have people like leave comments on my videos that are
02:25:34 like how do i find this anime and i'm like google is right there just type watch and the name of the
02:25:41 show and you're done and it's like i've known that forever but some people don't even realize that
02:25:46 that it's that easy you know and so i worry that as we move towards everyone being on youtube and
02:25:51 everyone being on twitter that people will will not pick up these skills on how to find
02:25:58 interesting stuff on the internet and uh i value those skills personally
02:26:04 sorry that's it for this podcast everybody say goodbye
02:26:08 bye i have been i have been nine oh mr black and platinum yeah master of the master black and
