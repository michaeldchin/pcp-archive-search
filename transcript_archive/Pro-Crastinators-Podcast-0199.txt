00:00:00 Hello everybody and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm
00:00:09 the best guy ever, and I'm about $20,000 richer off of this Kickstarter.
00:00:14 Hey everybody, this episode of The Pro Crastinator is brought to you by Mike Bloomberg for President
00:00:22 2020, depositing $20,000 directly into our Kickstarter account, and now we're bought
00:00:28 and paid for, baby. Mike, he's the cool candidate. Bill, Mike, love that guy. Did you hear as well?
00:00:34 This message is sponsored by Pete Buttigieg's dog, who he roleplays as on Twitter.
00:00:41 Yeah? It's true. Much like Spoonie, Pete Buttigieg also has dog roleplay accounts on Twitter,
00:00:50 where he roleplays some dogs. Well, I'm gonna have to look into that. I mean, the joke about Pete is
00:00:55 that he strangles dogs in the studio. So I don't know if that's a deliberate attempt to get ahead of
00:01:02 that message. He roleplays the dog being into it. That's what he does. Every day he strangles dog
00:01:08 after dog, but one day there was a dog whose neck was so strong he just couldn't ring it, and he
00:01:11 thought, you know what, this one comes with me. Yes, that's right. Hey guys, in case you haven't
00:01:17 seen it, of course, you should definitely go check out the now concluded Radcon 4 Paradise
00:01:23 Kickstarter page. Obviously, it was a success as of several weeks ago. When you hear this,
00:01:28 it'll be closed. For us, we've got like two days left, and we are right on the cusp of 20,000,
00:01:33 as we speak. Incredible. As we speak, we are almost there, with about, what, 40 hours to go? 45?
00:01:39 That's right. And I'm talking like $150 to get their give or take. So it's looking good. It's
00:01:44 looking good. Oh, well, well, well, well, well, well, well. Here we are. Hot fuck.
00:01:51 I mean, when we started, so, man, it's funny to look back on it. When we started, there was all
00:01:57 this debate and ringing of teeth and gnashing of nails about how much to charge. And I mean,
00:02:06 you know, it was all understandable that we not try to overcharge people based on like how much
00:02:11 we earned last time. We undercharged them. As a matter of business, we 100% undercharged,
00:02:18 because we just lost money on the whole operation. This time, oh, praise God. Oh, the first time.
00:02:23 No, no, no, no. Listen, we've lesson learned again. You can never gouge hard. And we have just
00:02:30 at the, wait, oh my God, I just saw the tally on the Kickstarter tick up. Let me refresh the,
00:02:35 what the fuck? It went over 20,000 and then it dipped back down. I think someone pledged and
00:02:40 then immediately unpledged. Oh, wait, no, there it goes. Boom. There it goes. It's going back over.
00:02:44 I'm going to die. 20,000. I'm seeing 19,831 for me. I did. I'll refresh the damn page. Okay. I got
00:02:52 it. I got it. I'm going to die. Oh, no. Help. Oh, please. I'm seeing the page go above it. No,
00:02:57 okay. It keeps like cycling over 20,000. Okay. Well, I have no doubt it will make over 20,000.
00:03:02 Yeah, it says 20K for me. I just want to see the number. I just want to see the number.
00:03:07 20,081. And $81.77. I'm going to put a link in the show. For me, it says 19. Okay. Now I'm
00:03:15 seeing 20,000. It updated actually without me having to reload the page. For me, it says
00:03:19 19,831. It'll do in a second. I'm seeing 20,080. Give it a minute. My internet is being shit today.
00:03:27 Well, that means I'm writing chapter five, I guess. Chapter five. And a physical release.
00:03:32 Print that shit. Yep. So let's talk about that. 20,001. Oh, 081 actually, but close enough.
00:03:42 Ben, you've done some physical printings of comics before. Yeah. How has that gone for you?
00:03:48 Pretty easy. Yeah, yeah. Well, actually, I've been thinking about this. Yeah, I printed
00:03:55 vapors one and vapors two. It was pretty easy. I used a website or a printing service called
00:03:59 Blam, with a dash between Ka and Blam. I mean, yeah, you just like saved your, you get like
00:04:09 high res image files. Okay. Yeah, I, this, this service was for like comic printing.
00:04:15 There would probably be cheaper ways to print like a text thing. I imagine like,
00:04:24 yeah, people say Amazon publishing is good for that. So you don't even have to submit like a
00:04:28 PDF, but just actually image files. And they like, I mean, they wanted me to save them as this,
00:04:34 like a TNG file or something, but like, whatever it was. The next generation Star Trek.
00:04:40 I don't think that was, it was something, it was some weird format, but yeah, they were just like,
00:04:43 save all your files in high resolution as this file, like send them to us in a zip file, and we'll
00:04:48 just, we'll send you the fucking thing when it's ready, which, um, yeah, can't wait to do that
00:04:54 again for papers too. Once all my guests artists get their pages in, hint, hint, hint, if you are
00:05:03 listening, I was planning to use the same website to print my book just because there's going to
00:05:08 be a bunch of comic pages, manga pages in my book. And, uh, they have the option on that website to
00:05:14 get the book manga sized as a paperback. Like, yeah, you can get it a little book. That sounds nice.
00:05:19 So yeah, I think that would be sick.
00:05:22 You know, I don't know, I got recommended that service by another comic maker.
00:05:27 You might want to maybe ask around other like book writers about whether it's the cheapest
00:05:32 way to go about printing a text novel. I mean, again, I've heard that the Amazon service is good
00:05:36 for, even for printing, so I don't know, I had to look into that as well, but if...
00:05:40 Call up our old friend, ask him with that experience as well.
00:05:42 He's Lulu, he didn't use it.
00:05:44 Oh, okay, okay.
00:05:45 I was, uh, I was fucking around the other night. I was feeling like too probably, probably in the
00:05:52 wake of like the New Hampshire, the New Hampshire primaries or something. I was too emotionally
00:05:57 drained. I was too, I had gone through too much turmoil and I couldn't think anymore.
00:06:02 So I was like, man, I'm not, I gotta, I gotta do some shit. I gotta do some work, but I can't think.
00:06:08 So I was like, I'll do some thoughtless work and I'll just, for no, no particular reason at all,
00:06:12 like just, just because maybe. I'll just, I'll just take slime and punishment and arrange it into
00:06:18 pages as though it were to be printed in a book or something at some future date. And I'll just do,
00:06:25 I don't know why. I don't know, just, just fucking around. So, so I was doing that and then I was
00:06:30 looking around for like printers, because Ka-Blam will not, I was thinking if it were going to be
00:06:35 printed, it would be in like, I was imagining it like the Homestuck book, you know, basically
00:06:40 landscape style, like four panels like that. But Ka-Blam won't print in landscape. It only does
00:06:46 formats that are portrait arrangement. So I was like, fuck. So I briefly started looking around
00:06:54 for like alternatives and I didn't find anything, but I'm sure there's, maybe I should look at Amazon
00:07:02 for, I don't know, because thing about slime and punishment is that it's like full color and like,
00:07:08 if there were like any limitations on color in like, in like the physical printing, it would
00:07:12 look like complete shit, right? Because it's got so many like fully saturated, like crushed
00:07:18 collies and stuff. So the, it must be robust. Anyway, I don't know. That's, that's, I'll, I'll,
00:07:30 I'll look at it. I'll take a look at Amazon might, might be worth it. Fucking Ka-Blam,
00:07:35 fucking Ka-Blam will only print comics that look like comic books or manga. It will do like,
00:07:43 because slime and punishment printed physically would be like, well over 100 pages. And if you
00:07:47 get over 64 pages, it doesn't, it won't print it as a comic. It will, it has to print it as a,
00:07:53 like a quote unquote paperback. And I guess that means, you know, it has a spine and everything.
00:08:01 But it still won't change the, it still won't, it still won't landscape.
00:08:06 I need it landscape. I don't want to print it vertically. That's dumb. It was published on
00:08:11 Twitter in a, in a four, in a four image, an update, layout. I want to preserve that.
00:08:19 That's important.
00:08:20 Makes sense, makes sense. Yeah, I was wondering about the, the whole like amount of pages,
00:08:25 because the Vapors chapters have only been, what, like, 20, 20 pages? Vapors one was 40 something.
00:08:32 The Lord of Ghost comic, I was thinking of, of making a thing as well. Chapter three is out,
00:08:37 by the way. Yeah, that's right. Chapter three, link in the description. It just came out, right?
00:08:42 Just came out. Minutes ago.
00:08:45 As soon as I entered the call. Minutes ago for us.
00:08:49 For us. Right. It's been out since.
00:08:51 Sunday for you listening, folks.
00:08:54 Yeah, but the final thing will be about 100 pages almost. So I'm thinking,
00:09:00 is that, would that be a problem? But I guess not. Yeah, yeah.
00:09:05 I'm sure there's a way to do it.
00:09:07 Guys, and we got to talk about this, because I'm here with the two of you, Ben and Gibbon,
00:09:11 who draw comics. And that's all I've been doing for the last couple weeks.
00:09:17 Yeah. And it's, it's pretty great. Drawing comics is better than drawing regular illustrations.
00:09:23 IMO. You think so? How do you figure?
00:09:27 Let me put it to you like this. In a similar sense that, I think that the more complex a medium is,
00:09:35 at the same time, there are more ways that you can fail, but also the failures are kind of muted
00:09:41 by the successes of other areas. I saw a great tweet yesterday. And I was like, I was like,
00:09:48 yes, I am living for this tweet. So relatable. I said, drawing comics is about accepting your
00:09:54 ugly panels and moving on. And I was like, that's so true. Ben, I have a new catchphrase, and this
00:10:02 is kind of going to be the overall like linchpin arc words of the book, Cus Omega, which is,
00:10:10 it's not about being clever. It's about pushing forward. And in so many ways, you know, yeah,
00:10:19 basically, AKA, please excuse my bad project, but I had to make something. So here it is.
00:10:26 Anything finished is like Brian Leo Malley said, anything finished is automatically better than
00:10:32 anything unfinished. Whatever it takes to get it done. The perfect is the enemy of the good. I
00:10:37 completely agree. The arc that the character goes through in the story is that like he had killed
00:10:42 himself because of the fact that he was writing nothing but bullshit for so long and never got
00:10:47 around to writing his ideas for stuff that would be like really great works of literature because
00:10:52 he didn't think he was good enough to actually write them. And so he just didn't. And then
00:10:57 ultimately ends up killing himself. And when he reflects on it, he's like, well, you know,
00:11:00 even if those stories hadn't come out the way I wanted, it would have been better to try than to
00:11:04 kill myself, you know, indeed, since it puts him into the situation and all. But but did you don't
00:11:11 you know that being born is inherently abuse? Our parents didn't get our consent to be born to
00:11:17 have to carry these burdens in this world. I think the character possibly could have made that
00:11:23 argument if not for the fact that killing himself just didn't bring him any release at all. It's
00:11:29 simply trapped him in a narrative of how I would argue it would for us, though. It would bring us
00:11:33 relief, ladies and gentlemen. We don't know that, though. You don't know. That's the mistake that
00:11:39 he made. You never see it coming. So so with regards to the comics, like more so than just
00:11:48 like bad panels being held up by good ones, but even just when we think about one punch man,
00:11:54 right, the original release, the strength of it was not just that it had a great concept,
00:11:59 which is already the biggest strength of one punch man, but also that one sincerely has
00:12:05 great compositions in his imagery. They're just not well drawn, you know, and so like I kind of
00:12:12 looked at it like as long as I can communicate the story through the facial expressions and poses
00:12:19 to a degree where you understand what this is supposed to look like, then it kind of can carry
00:12:26 itself. That's it. You've got it. You've got it. You activate the imagination. It's just about like
00:12:30 my, especially with slime and punishment. I mean, in particular with slime and punishment. It's just
00:12:35 about get a page done and done means it conveys the thing I wanted to convey. Right. Yeah. And then
00:12:42 it's done. I mean, it's funny because I'm already used to doing that in other forms of art, so it
00:12:47 kind of comes naturally to me to transition that mode of thinking into comics. I just had never
00:12:52 really tried it before, but because of the fact that I'm doing this physical release of Cusomega,
00:12:57 and I decided to hire a bunch of artists to work on it, and I storyboarded all the comics
00:13:03 that are going to be in it. So I did 18 pages of comics and then another 12 for... Did you ever
00:13:10 giggle to yourself thinking like, hey, I'm just like that guy from Bakuman, you know, the one who...
00:13:15 Yes. The writer. Exactly. That's what I would do. You mean the blonde guy? The glasses guy. Yeah,
00:13:23 that guy. I mean the author himself, because like in Bakuman, they sometimes will show the
00:13:28 storyboards that Tsugumi Oba does for Bakuman, and then show Takeshi Obata's redone storyboards,
00:13:35 where he like, you know, he redraws it and makes it more dynamic and like changes the
00:13:40 structure of all the boxes before he goes in and draws it, you know, which is exactly what
00:13:44 some of these artists did who are working on... Like, some of my comics, they took it and really
00:13:49 re-adapted it into something very different, whereas there's one guy who is the one who kind of gave
00:13:54 me the idea to do this project, who really just wants to draw comics written by me. Like, that
00:14:00 was his goal. He was like, I will just... He didn't even want payment. He was just like, I just want
00:14:04 to draw comics, you write, right? Based on this story. So I've got him doing like a 12 page comic.
00:14:12 Kind of fucked that guy a little bit. For bringing down everyone else's potential
00:14:18 earning, potential buy. A little bit of a scab, a little bit of a pick and line crossing.
00:14:23 They need a union. No, for what it's worth, I'm not having him do anything for free. I told him...
00:14:27 There you go. I will not accept that. But uh, unless it was for no profit, but this particular
00:14:35 profit is... Sure, sure. If nobody's... If nobody's... If nobody's making any money, then sure.
00:14:40 But it's fascinating because he has been adapting my storyboards like
00:14:44 almost exactly to where it's basically just the same images, but with that level of detail that
00:14:50 I am just not capable of, you know? That's what you want. But it's funny, it's not exactly what
00:14:57 I want the most because I don't think my storyboards are necessarily amazing. So if they can be
00:15:02 improved, then by all means go for it, you know, which a lot of the other artists have done. But
00:15:06 it is... It's good in a sense that I can say, okay, well, like, this will let me see exactly
00:15:13 what this would look like fully realized. And then I can truly understand, like,
00:15:17 what am I doing right and wrong in my storyboarding? You know, this is a fascinating
00:15:21 point because not to be an asshole to that guy, but it sounds like he might be the kind of guy
00:15:25 who's such a big fan of yours that he might be afraid to tweak anything that you put. So he
00:15:30 wants to just stick to it. Whereas if you have somebody who... Let's say like you just reach out
00:15:33 to like a true pro and you pay him a million dollars, and they're like, yeah, I know what I'm
00:15:37 doing, I'll adapt your ideas, then they'll add some of their own expertise and artistic flair.
00:15:41 I mean, for what it's worth... I don't want to downplay how much he adds to it just because
00:15:46 the quality of my drawing is so low that the fact that he could extrapolate it into something that
00:15:51 looks correct is like, oh, wow, this is what you would need to add. Like, it's significantly
00:15:58 different, you know, in spite of the fact of being the same pose-wise.
00:16:02 You posted some of these redrawn stuff on Twitter, right?
00:16:06 I posted the two-page comic that he did. Link that.
00:16:10 Oh, that's his? I thought that was pretty good. The one with... Yes. Yeah, I saw that. It looks good.
00:16:18 Yeah, it looks real good. I agree. That's why I'm excited about this project.
00:16:24 But yeah, I'll link... I will post in the gross audio links the original storyboards as well,
00:16:31 so you can prepare them. Oh, this one. Oh, yeah, this does... This is excellent.
00:16:37 That's solid. By the way, the thing about... I like about the comic vibrations with numbers for
00:16:46 letters. This link is to the storyboards. These are probably available, so it's no big...
00:16:53 Yeah, the thing I like about the drawing of comics, and it is kind of like a storyboard
00:16:58 for animation a lot of the time, where you can imply a lot of movement by just having the same
00:17:05 thing shot like a few seconds after what it looks like. You're basically doing keyframes,
00:17:12 but really with no in-betweens whatsoever, and then that way you can convey so much more movement
00:17:19 than... Well, I mean, traditional illustration, just one image, it's always just felt like
00:17:23 there's not enough going on, because nothing can happen. It's a still moment in time. It's a photograph.
00:17:29 I mean, I wrote a piece on this before, but I actually had a website for Cusomega that got
00:17:34 taken down today because it exceeded its bandwidth limit from a fucking 3-note or whatever the...
00:17:41 They give you very low bandwidth limit. That or it was taken down because it had adult content on
00:17:46 it. I'm not sure which, because they didn't tell me anything, and it's just gone, so I might have
00:17:52 to build a whole new website, which is really annoying, because there's a lot of content on...
00:17:57 Like, I literally wrote a fucking massive thing that I only posted there and do not have backup of,
00:18:03 so let's hope I get that back. But in there, I was talking about how part of what inspired
00:18:08 all these comics and illustrations is that in the book, these two characters, Crom and Baila,
00:18:13 do not get really described in all that much detail. They're briefly touched on. Baila is not
00:18:19 described enough that you could even draw a picture of her. She didn't get any fan art.
00:18:25 So I was thinking just, what is the maximum amount I can convey about these characters
00:18:31 with images in the span of a couple pages? And it's like, even just seeing the range of facial
00:18:36 expressions that a character would make, even just seeing three of them tells you so much about
00:18:41 the character, just because it's like, you only would imagine them making so many faces.
00:18:47 So in this comic, Baila's got the really intense... She's having a ton of fun casting magic,
00:18:54 almost like sadistic in the first page, and then it's more relaxed on the second page,
00:19:00 whereas her dad mostly looks kind of serious. And in the book, he never jokes about anything,
00:19:06 but because I have a comic, I can do a thought bubble on him and give him kind of a snarky thing
00:19:11 to say. And the last face is like, this really expressive anime face really only makes sense
00:19:17 visually. I don't know how I would describe it in text. So it's like... I know that face well.
00:19:24 Just being able to add that in and give you that mental image, going back to read the story,
00:19:30 will change your impression of the story. Now you have these anime characters in your mind,
00:19:34 and this range of expressions they're capable of. So when I describe the expressions that these
00:19:38 characters are showing, you are more likely to think about other anime you've seen with
00:19:45 characters who look kind of similar, and kind of just plug in those expressions. And I think
00:19:49 that's why light novels exist, basically. That's my theory. The theory is to make quick cash with
00:19:56 one good picture of an anime girl. Is there even any other medians where speech bubble or thought
00:20:03 bubbles can even be a thing that isn't weird? Anime does it, but it is weird. But they speak
00:20:09 sort of like in their head, because it's motion and it's movement. If somebody's thinking something,
00:20:15 the amount of time it takes for them to say the words that they're thinking is a lot longer than
00:20:19 it would actually take to think those thoughts. So it's like, it's a disconnect. Maybe this is
00:20:24 just because of the fact that I do this kind of analysis, and I'm always thinking about these
00:20:29 things. But what brings... I feel like I'm fucking trying to say, oh, I'm fucking, I just started
00:20:36 making comics, and they're already good. But the theory behind what I'm approaching these
00:20:41 comics with is, what can I do in comics that I couldn't do in writing, and couldn't do in these
00:20:47 other mediums? Because that's what excites me the most about the idea of making them is, oh,
00:20:53 this is a whole different angle. These are stories that... This story in text is not interesting
00:20:58 in any way, but as a visual guide to the characters, there's a fun snappiness to it.
00:21:06 It got me really excited, because after drawing all these comics, none of which I planned at all.
00:21:11 I did not write anything. I just started drawing and let it develop, and it was so much fun,
00:21:20 I couldn't stop. And now it's a problem, because...
00:21:24 You should just stop the whole YouTube thing. Be like a creator boy, like me and Ben. Make comics.
00:21:30 I'm implying that YouTube is not creation in any way. I mean, okay, for many people it's not, but
00:21:35 okay. It's literally the dumbest thing you could ever do.
00:21:40 That's not true. Frank Yang is an artist who makes weird fitness slash art piece videos that are
00:21:46 about the perfect sprinter, Tom Cruise, how I will obtain. It's Andrew Yang's younger, more
00:21:53 muscly brother. Definitely, yeah. By the way, I just let me just say, fuck comics, all trash,
00:22:00 put them into the garbage, and thank God that on today's episode we have an announcement of
00:22:06 a happy time from a guy who has abandoned comics for all time and become an exclusive video man,
00:22:12 one Munchyshatsky, who has destroyed Investigator and is releasing today, the day we are recording
00:22:19 this, three new episodes of Stealing Your Dad have just dropped. I can't believe it. They're all
00:22:24 out right now. No, they're not. Oh, you're right, you're right. They are at the time of you listening
00:22:29 to this, but they are coming out every three hours over the course of the whole day. Episode
00:22:32 one is out though. Are they on his channel? Yes, they're on Munchy on his channel. So I just
00:22:40 linked his channel, we'll put it in the show notes there. To clarify, because nobody actually has any
00:22:45 idea what Stealing Your Dad's is. I was on it and I still don't. Let me explain. So Stealing
00:22:52 Your Dad's is originally a podcast that me and Munchy were doing in which we review fast food
00:22:58 by both of us going and getting the same fast food, because obviously fast food exists all around
00:23:02 the country. We would buy the same fast food and then record a podcast of us eating and reviewing
00:23:08 it. But also, because we were describing the setting of the world that we were in,
00:23:15 which is extremely, we would say it's basically the prototype of the world in
00:23:21 Ratty Fockers' Comkillers. Yeah, endless war. There is fear eyes that they're located in the same
00:23:30 along the same time. They are similar enough, fallout-esque super apocalypses that they can
00:23:37 feasibly exist in the same universe. They're both highly fast food-based. Yeah. The thing about
00:23:44 the show, though, is that for the most part, it was highly experimental. The audio quality is
00:23:49 not good. It is experimental audio quality. The experiment is, what if I turned it down?
00:23:58 What if I made it worse? So most of these only have a couple hundred views. I don't know that
00:24:04 there was any expectation from any audience that this would continue or that they wanted it in
00:24:09 any way. Well, clearly there was a small but dedicated audience. Well, because the thing is that
00:24:16 the three that we recorded at Radcon were videos, live-action videos, which were meant to be fully
00:24:22 edited by Ethan, I think, who also edited the Spicy Bro Pack video, which there's also a Spicy Bro
00:24:28 Packed from Radcon 3 that also has still not come out. But the one from Radcon 2 took a whole year,
00:24:35 so that's not a surprise. But yeah, these three have just been waiting in Limbo for the last
00:24:40 fucking literally nearly two years since we fucking did it. That's right. Is that how long it's
00:24:44 been? Wait, when did we do Radcon 3? Yeah, it took T-Bap Resurrection one full year to get done,
00:24:49 and it's been over a year since that. Oh my god. I was going to say these were the last Radcontent,
00:24:54 but no, I guess that Spicy Bro Packed is still... Oh wait, technically it was in March, so it's
00:24:59 technically been just under two years. That's the time for me. Yeah, sure. Which by the way,
00:25:04 the original Spicy Bro Packed video was like one of my favorite videos. It was fucking just
00:25:09 legendary. It was sick. And so that's why I've been nauseating. That's the reason like my excitement
00:25:14 over stealing your dad's has... I mean, I'm looking at people have screencapped some incredible
00:25:20 moments from the first episode in my Discord. Yeah, I'll go ahead and I'm going to have the...
00:25:25 Yeah, I haven't watched any of them, obviously. They just came out like minutes ago.
00:25:30 You know, we need to call this episode. We need to call this episode We Did It.
00:25:34 Munchie did it. Gib did it. Ben did it. Did you. Nate did it. The Radcon's a huge success. We did
00:25:40 it. They're on Munchie's channel, right? Yeah, they are. They're all there. Okay. Ew, gross.
00:25:46 Why is that happening? How unfortunate.
00:25:51 Let me bathe you in my meal. That might have to be my new avatar on Twitter or something.
00:25:56 That's pretty good. Ew, it's so gross. Oh, I don't like that at all. It's a Wendy's ice cream.
00:26:06 It's in Gross Disgusting. Gross Disgusting is right.
00:26:10 We did it. So true. So true. Click the link, everybody. God, I'm so glad those videos are
00:26:16 out. We did it. There it is. They did it. We did nothing. No. We were in the vicinity.
00:26:27 We were on the right side of history. Oh, they're from here. You know, the only issue I have,
00:26:30 or the one thing I'm concerned about with Radcon, not really, but I just want to,
00:26:34 we've got a bunch of stuff we've got to do. I want to leave those precious spaces in
00:26:38 between things to do whatever the fuck we feel like, you know? So maybe we can just
00:26:43 smash everything out really fast and then just do whatever we want for like the last bit of time.
00:26:48 Oh, oh, I'm sorry. And then I saw on Twitter the thing, I saw one individual whose name I forget
00:26:54 say the thing that gets tossed around here and there. And this guy is just like,
00:26:57 y'all nibbaz really paid these guys $20,000 to go on vacation, which is hilarious, which is a
00:27:04 hilarious thing to say. And entirely true. 100% true. That's definitely a major component of the
00:27:11 story. But hey, voluntary exchanges of currency for products and services. Good stuff. Good stuff.
00:27:20 Very excited. We've got like three weeks until we're out there doing shit. When you hear this,
00:27:25 it'll be like two weeks. So incredible. What a world. By the way, this is episode 199.
00:27:32 Next episode is 200. That's right. So I don't know what that means, but it means.
00:27:37 Oh yeah. Shall we talk about our plan to like do episode 200 at Redcon 4 regardless and just
00:27:46 skip. Just skip it. Skip it. Skip it for the meantime. Just do it. Well, when we're there.
00:27:51 We could, we could, we could role play for the next two episodes from the post-apocalypse
00:27:56 episode. Like it's a flash forward in the narrative. The post-apocalypse with the word,
00:28:01 with the number 200 doesn't exist. And we have to skip to 201 instead. We have to find it.
00:28:05 We're recording them from the future after like, oh, okay, just here's a thought. We record next
00:28:10 episode, episode 201. It's us. Maybe I shouldn't even say it, but it's us responding to the reaction
00:28:16 to Radcon 3 from the future narratively and the cataclysmic failure that it was and how everything
00:28:23 went wrong and we lost all the money, you know, et cetera, et cetera. It was all embezzled by,
00:28:28 was that company that stole all of Hussie's money when he was trying to make that game?
00:28:31 We partnered with them. The King's Crab, Darling House. No, the, the, the, the, the something
00:28:35 gentleman. The odd gentleman. The odd gentleman. Yeah, we partnered with them for distribution
00:28:40 and that turned out to be a bad idea. But you know, we were rolling with the punches.
00:28:44 We got to ask Daddy Mike Bloomberg for some more funding. We got, we got to go dip back into that
00:28:49 well. You know, speaking of corporate investment, I, I was looking at a couple of the, after our
00:28:56 stunning success with the Garling House Industries people, we still don't have our channel back,
00:29:01 by the way. That's pretty cool. Hopefully that'll be fixed soon. They seem to be really nice. It'd
00:29:07 be really nice if we had it back, which it seems, well, YouTube said they were on the cusp, but
00:29:13 YouTube said we were on the cusp of getting it back. They seem to be preparing to give it back
00:29:17 to us. They're just edging. They're edging us for sure. It would be really nice if we could have
00:29:22 it back by the time that the Kickstarter ends, because we're going to do that, like on the day
00:29:27 it ends, we're going to like stream for a few hours beforehand, like count down the hours,
00:29:32 probably like shout out like big doughnose and stuff. Let me just say for fun that like the,
00:29:36 the last message of substance I got on like the PCPA account was them saying like, hey,
00:29:42 hey bro, like we're working on your thing. We are going to move your account to like a new brand
00:29:47 account. So like they seem to have identified the problem. They're like, make a new brand
00:29:51 account, which is just like a new type of YouTube channel. We will like move the PCP onto the account,
00:29:55 give us the link, bro. I'm like instantly, okay, provide them the link. And then I'm also like,
00:30:01 Hey, also, should I make more for like the other channels? They have that. And they just have not
00:30:06 fixed the problem. And it's been like four days. I don't know why, maybe because the weekend is
00:30:11 happening now. But they have everything they need to restore the channel and seem to be waiting
00:30:18 and willing to do so instantly. They just have not let alone. This makes me really,
00:30:26 this makes me really depressed about the potential about the future of the other channels like the
00:30:32 PODcast and TBAP and a little bit. Yeah, like the fact that they are so lazy about it. Like,
00:30:39 I mean, I guess TBAP and PODcast have like, I mean, best guy ever is obviously the biggest channel.
00:30:46 The other ones are all like that. How many how many subs did the PODcast have?
00:30:51 Like 5,000 to 5,000, 6,000 something like that. So not a high priority thing.
00:30:55 In theory, I think the PCP should be next and then TBAP's got like 13k. So that should be that
00:31:02 should be next, right? Yeah, I'm glad that to my knowledge, nobody's been like uploading
00:31:08 shit or fucking around with that one other than changing the description to some weird
00:31:11 cryptic Russian shit. I would feel so violated if the stuff that was going on on these other
00:31:16 channels were happening on TBAP. I would be I would feel I would be sick. Well, now's a great
00:31:21 time to mention what is happening right now on CanTent, which is legitimately fascinating.
00:31:29 As Digi pointed out on Twitter, and I had also noticed that on CanTent right now,
00:31:33 let me I'll link you guys to the channel down below, we do not have control. The last two,
00:31:38 no, I think three videos now, what they are, are re-edits of me and Digi's old
00:31:45 Eremaga Sensei podcast. That's correct, Gib. They have specifically re-edited the full content
00:31:52 and made new thumbnails and new titles for them. We have never given them. Someone's working on
00:31:57 this shit. What's crazy is they're doing a good job. It's not a bad job. Yeah, better than us.
00:32:04 They took the episodes. I think what they did is they downloaded the ones that are on After Dark
00:32:10 because they're uploaded as individual episodes with the images. They used the same images that
00:32:17 were in the After Dark uploads, but then they add an episode one big splash on it. And then the
00:32:22 thumbnails, they cut together three different screen caps from the episode, it seems like,
00:32:26 and bleed them together. Which is your style of editing on CanTent now. It looks like shit the
00:32:32 way they do it, but it also is good. I look at it and I go, that looks like shit, but I bet
00:32:37 everybody would click on that. It's like a missing connection. I would never do, but I'm aware that
00:32:42 people who watch the video won't give a shit and will click on it anyway. They're doing a better
00:32:46 job because they're more cutthroat. The titles and descriptions and everything are like,
00:32:53 they use the actual titles of the episodes, which what they're probably trying to do,
00:32:59 and this might work, is so one of the problems we've had on the PCP channel and on DigiBro is
00:33:06 the Ghibli cast has a shit ton of views, but it's because somebody has taken them and plugged them
00:33:13 in on some like watch cartoon online website as the movies because they're about the same length.
00:33:20 They have the titles of the movie and the date, the year, which I think is really what makes them
00:33:24 think it's real. All of them have like 60% dislikes and just tons of angry comments that it's not
00:33:31 the movie, which is annoying and probably not good, healthy for the video, but I wonder if that's
00:33:39 what they're going for, which also happened to Rixity Minutes. Every episode had the same problem.
00:33:45 It's too bad. That's too bad. I'm really excited guys because let me see. Tonight at 7 p.m. I'm
00:33:52 really excited because Aramunga Sensei Anime Discussed Season 1 Episode 4 premieres on the
00:33:56 content channel. I'm really excited to watch that and see what these guys have to say.
00:34:01 By the way, these all have like hundreds of views. What are they doing in the video edit wise?
00:34:07 Are they just like cutting bits or moving things around? They just loop a gif over the video mostly
00:34:13 and just let our audio play. Looking at the first episode, it's just the exact same one image that
00:34:19 I had. Oh wait, Episode 2? Yeah, they do loop a gif the whole time. That's even more advanced.
00:34:24 What the fuck? Is it? This is advanced. I like how it works.
00:34:28 They literally improved it. I know.
00:34:32 On whatever black market, as what I was thinking, the black market of YouTube sites, we could just
00:34:39 buy free subs, you can buy YouTube channels from Russian hackers. Somebody who knows,
00:34:45 who Canton or Digibro or Nate is, was on this site and would be like, what,
00:34:50 Canton? Yeah, I'll buy it. And they know a little bit about something.
00:34:57 Did you mention the original title that it was premiered with?
00:35:00 Whoa. When the first re-upload went up and premiered, it was called He-He-It's-Dakanton, right?
00:35:07 Oh, okay. Well, that's because that's the default title on the channel, so that's not...
00:35:12 That's like a... They just haven't fixed it yet.
00:35:14 That makes a little more sense and it's slightly less creepy.
00:35:17 It's weird. I don't know why would anyone use a channel? I guess they just hope for...
00:35:25 I mean, this channel has been moved to some thieves' Google account,
00:35:31 and they are now earning all the ad revenue generated by all videos on the channel.
00:35:35 I just wonder if there's some troll who knows what they have.
00:35:43 Someone knows something about how this works.
00:35:45 Well, whether it just so happens to be someone who knows a little bit about anime YouTube videos
00:35:50 enough to edit and re-upload the same thing.
00:35:53 If they know about anime YouTube videos, they must know who Digibro is.
00:35:58 Very likely. It's all very curious and I don't understand.
00:36:01 I got to say, my favorite thing about this is that the thumbnails themselves,
00:36:05 they made thumbnails, they added more images.
00:36:08 I got to say, they're doing a good job with the thumbnails.
00:36:10 They are shitty, but they're clickable shitty.
00:36:13 Shout out to Brad Garlinghouse.
00:36:17 A cutthroat businessman. I've got a lot to learn.
00:36:19 I'm learning a lot here.
00:36:20 Here's what I want to know, because again, these videos, these re-uploads,
00:36:24 are getting pretty good views.
00:36:27 For our channel, not bad.
00:36:28 Probably a lot of its curiosity clicks just like, what the fuck?
00:36:32 Maybe some people sincerely haven't listened to it and are listening to it for the first time.
00:36:38 I want to know what the sub count looks like, because they hide that shit when they take over
00:36:41 your channel.
00:36:41 Yeah, we might be gaining from them sometimes.
00:36:44 It would be so fucking funny.
00:36:46 That would be fascinating.
00:36:49 This is a new channel with you and me, so there's definitely growing going on in general.
00:36:53 But I mean, the upload rate is basically every half a day.
00:36:57 They're posting another episode.
00:36:59 It is our content.
00:37:01 It's good content.
00:37:03 They're marketing it well.
00:37:05 I just don't know if this would even cost us any subscribers.
00:37:08 The only thing it's costing us right now, if we never get the channel back, that's bad.
00:37:13 If we get it back even now, we'll have lost some ad revenue.
00:37:17 But we gained some subs.
00:37:18 I mean, hey, I'll call that one a wash, I guess, a month of ad revenue loss.
00:37:20 I mean, we weren't posting videos on the channel, so if any...
00:37:23 I mean, we were going to post the Pat LeBour, Pat Labor video on there.
00:37:29 I'm saying we can't post anything there right now.
00:37:31 So at least they're posting for us.
00:37:33 Oh, so they're helping.
00:37:34 Right, right.
00:37:35 They're keeping the algorithm happy.
00:37:36 My favorite thing is that they've kept the can-tent logo,
00:37:40 like editing scheme for thumbnails that we were doing, the KH.
00:37:44 But because no one except you and I has access to the can-tent logo without the background,
00:37:49 they've shittily cropped out the edges from our channel logo and slapped.
00:37:55 You can see that a lower editing skill level is making these,
00:38:01 but this is absolutely fascinating what's going on in this channel.
00:38:05 Please give it back, though, YouTube.
00:38:06 I'm dying here.
00:38:09 We just only got the channel up and running and actually making some money and then this shit.
00:38:14 We are up to $20,182 on the Kickstarter.
00:38:19 It just keeps going.
00:38:20 It just keeps charging along.
00:38:22 44 hours to go.
00:38:24 We did it.
00:38:25 Yeah.
00:38:25 That's the meme this episode.
00:38:26 We're doing it.
00:38:28 At this very moment.
00:38:30 Man, Wrecked Hunt 4 is going to be so fucking cool.
00:38:32 It's going to be a great time.
00:38:33 It's going to be so lit.
00:38:35 Holy shit.
00:38:35 Oh, lit.
00:38:35 I'm excited.
00:38:36 It's going to be the shit.
00:38:37 I got the fucking anime wig in the mail the other day.
00:38:41 Oh, you did?
00:38:42 Do you want to tell us what any details?
00:38:44 Because I'm fascinated.
00:38:45 I'm going to save mine for the video when it comes out, I think,
00:38:48 but I'm curious about everybody else.
00:38:49 All right, it's just a long black girl hair wig for cosplay and you just put it on.
00:38:57 But it made, it was like, huh, this is sort of, this is sort of punk like,
00:39:02 you know, I could almost pass myself off as punk.
00:39:05 So I was thinking of buying clothes.
00:39:08 Kind of like in Radcon, The Road to Radcon 3 Chapter 3.
00:39:12 You know what I'm saying?
00:39:12 You know what I'm saying?
00:39:13 Yeah.
00:39:14 And I was looking at myself in the mirror with this fucking punk wig on my head.
00:39:18 And I was like, hmm, this feels right.
00:39:21 I have a very masculine jawline.
00:39:22 I've just realized.
00:39:23 You do.
00:39:24 That's true.
00:39:25 In my, in my head, like putting on a wig would make me look like a girl.
00:39:31 And then that would be that.
00:39:32 And I would look like a girl on the screen.
00:39:34 It's me, the anime girl.
00:39:36 Yeah.
00:39:36 But instead I looked like a 70s rocker.
00:39:38 And I was like, oh, well, that's still cool, I suppose.
00:39:45 And it's on special way.
00:39:46 So you guys, have you all listened to The Road to Radcon 4?
00:39:50 I have listened, yes.
00:39:51 I have not gotten around to listening to any of The Road to Radcon.
00:39:54 I'm sorry.
00:39:55 Go men aside.
00:39:56 Yeah, I just haven't finished it yet.
00:39:59 I want to know everybody's perspective on how you feel about your portrayal in the story.
00:40:05 Oh, great.
00:40:05 Yeah, let's talk about that.
00:40:07 All right.
00:40:08 I love ripped jacked punk.
00:40:11 I hope so.
00:40:12 Ripped, ripped jacked punk.
00:40:15 Oh, ripped jacked punk is so, I mean, as soon as I saw the thumbnail, I was like, oh.
00:40:23 Oh, no, what is this?
00:40:27 And it just got, it was cropped at like the abs.
00:40:30 When you click on the video, you can see the abs.
00:40:32 And they're just like, it's like a fucking accordion.
00:40:36 Well, it says she still has the stick legs of normal punk.
00:40:40 But yes, they just connect straight to the abs.
00:40:43 So, or he, I should say, because it's you.
00:40:47 You are jacked punk.
00:40:48 I am jacked punk with J-Pump tits.
00:40:51 Yes.
00:40:53 The little bit of boob popping out below the shirt is by a.
00:40:58 They got under boob.
00:40:59 Yeah, under boob.
00:41:00 There is massive under boob going on.
00:41:03 Are those two pumpkins in there?
00:41:04 That's gotta be what's going on.
00:41:06 That's hilarious.
00:41:06 Two, three, three more.
00:41:08 I think jacked pump and also the even more so possibly the
00:41:13 illustration of Ben in episode two are my two favorite things
00:41:17 I've ever drawn in my whole life.
00:41:19 Oh, yeah.
00:41:19 I would put them both on t-shirts.
00:41:21 Absolutely.
00:41:23 I want people to draw a fan art of jacked punk.
00:41:25 I think that like, I mean, punk is a very easy to draw sort of face.
00:41:29 So it sort of works well.
00:41:33 Oh, you know what I'm saying already.
00:41:35 I'm very upset about my portrayal in this image.
00:41:39 You are vaping from the exhaust pipe of the of the Gravedigger monster truck.
00:41:47 I thought it was like, yeah, hooked up a hose to the to the tail.
00:41:52 You reside at the bottom of a basically the Goron city from Ocarina of Time,
00:41:58 except that it's full of antifa and smoke from your vape.
00:42:02 And that's basically cop kill town is what you describe.
00:42:06 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:42:07 Regarding my portrayal in the second part of chapter two,
00:42:11 to me, now I hate that I don't mean to overstate the case,
00:42:15 but I really feel like you were like, I did all the work with Ben.
00:42:18 Let's just get this Nate part done and move on to.
00:42:20 Well, have you heard part three yet?
00:42:25 I did not finish part three yet.
00:42:27 When you get to parts three and four, you'll truly appreciate what I have done with you.
00:42:31 Because the joke is that you are a shockingly accurate portrayal of you.
00:42:39 All the commenters agree that my Nate is spot on,
00:42:42 because everybody else is over the top and ridiculous.
00:42:45 I was crying for personality.
00:42:47 I'm like, I'm so boring in this, but if that is the joke.
00:42:51 The joke is that nothing has changed about you.
00:42:53 You are exactly the same.
00:42:55 And you are so predictable that I can write you to a level of accuracy that is
00:43:01 makes it feel weird even for me.
00:43:03 Did she knows you better than you know yourself?
00:43:05 But yeah, you're kind of like the main character,
00:43:08 because Brad fucked you over.
00:43:10 So you get a lot of dialogue in parts three and four.
00:43:12 Well, shit, I gotta get to it.
00:43:16 There's a lot of Ben and Nate back and forth banter, especially in chapter four.
00:43:21 I really tried to capture the feel of the PCP anytime there's a conversation.
00:43:28 I wanted it to feel like you are listening to an episode.
00:43:31 Yeah, I can get that a lot.
00:43:33 Never mind, I'm not listening to this.
00:43:36 I mean, I'll just read the record.
00:43:38 I loved the description.
00:43:39 I mean, your start at the beginning, Digi, of being a broken,
00:43:43 basically like a hollow from Undertale.
00:43:45 From doing too much.
00:43:49 Just being a waste rule of a man,
00:43:51 but some precious passerby just bringing the essence of life,
00:43:54 that piss that went straight into your mouth and revived you from the grave.
00:43:57 Munchy's piss is what literally I've been living on for God knows how long.
00:44:04 Munchy's piss and crack, which in chapter four,
00:44:07 you will learn the truth about the crack,
00:44:10 the true nature of Digi Bro's crack addiction, and what it really is.
00:44:15 I see.
00:44:15 I'm looking forward to it.
00:44:16 What could it mean?
00:44:17 Now we've got all the five parts, the whole thing, it's all funded.
00:44:21 Yeah, five is funded, so I gotta make the epic finale.
00:44:26 It's gonna have to be, I mean, these are part five,
00:44:28 I don't have to rush it because it's already done.
00:44:31 So like, it's not advertising the Kickstarter anymore,
00:44:34 but it'll probably be a lot longer.
00:44:37 I was so sure we would not hit 20k.
00:44:41 Yeah, let's talk about that for a second.
00:44:42 I was positive it was like a complete pie in the sky.
00:44:45 Like, this is a promise that will never have to be.
00:44:48 We thought 10k might have been unreachable at the very beginning.
00:44:50 I was pretty confident we had 10k.
00:44:52 But like, once the really good start happened, and then it sort of slowed down,
00:44:59 there was a lot of talk of like, at this rate, at this rate,
00:45:02 we're not gonna get to 20k or anything like that.
00:45:04 And I was like, yeah, but there's always a bump.
00:45:07 There's always a bump near the end.
00:45:08 There is always a bump, but it's not always-
00:45:10 There's always people, there's definitely people
00:45:12 who are like holding off on getting a paycheck.
00:45:15 It's not like doom and gloom just because it's at a certain rate,
00:45:19 because the rate changes every day.
00:45:21 I've heard tales around that there is at least one person
00:45:24 who I believe is planning to donate $1,000 to this day.
00:45:29 I don't know that for sure, but that's what I heard, Taylor.
00:45:31 That would be crazy.
00:45:32 Listener, that could be you.
00:45:34 It could be all of you.
00:45:37 It could be you every day.
00:45:39 You can do that any time you want.
00:45:40 You don't have to wait for a paycheck later.
00:45:41 That's true.
00:45:41 Just go to $70,000, please.
00:45:44 I mean, this is in the past now, so we won't know the final total that they will.
00:45:50 Well, that's true, that's true.
00:45:51 After the tragedy of having one more thousand boys
00:45:53 drop down- It's never too late to send us money.
00:45:55 Somebody actually has one time sent me $1,000.
00:45:58 That has happened before, so that was pretty sick.
00:46:00 That's pretty sick.
00:46:01 Disgusting.
00:46:02 The clothes, I mean-
00:46:03 It's disgusting because it happened to you and not me.
00:46:05 Exactly.
00:46:06 Arthur Mus gave me the Cintiq that he had liner,
00:46:11 which is probably valued at $1,000 plus.
00:46:13 It is, yeah.
00:46:14 Closest enough.
00:46:15 That's sick.
00:46:16 That's great.
00:46:16 $800 something.
00:46:19 Let me just review real quick.
00:46:20 All the things that's going to come to you.
00:46:22 So people have pledged, you get pins.
00:46:24 I mean, I know I've said it a million times,
00:46:25 I've got my Rad Country pin.
00:46:27 The pin brings me probably more joy,
00:46:29 like my shirts are in the closet.
00:46:31 I wear them all the time, sporadically, they give me joy.
00:46:34 Every day I sit down at my computer,
00:46:36 I look over in my purple and blue
00:46:38 Rad Country pin on the starry background,
00:46:40 and it just makes me happy.
00:46:41 It sparks joy is what it does.
00:46:44 I don't know if everybody else feels the same way,
00:46:45 but it does for me.
00:46:47 I have no purpose for pins,
00:46:48 so I don't know where to be tomorrow.
00:46:50 Well, in this case,
00:46:50 I kind of just have a little spot
00:46:52 on my printer to my right,
00:46:53 where I have my Puba pin,
00:46:54 my Rad Country pin,
00:46:55 and my little Slime Corp logo pins.
00:46:57 It's just my pin spot, I guess.
00:46:59 There's not on anything.
00:47:00 Michelle is hers on her bag or whatever.
00:47:02 But I'm not losing these,
00:47:03 I just want them to be there and make me happy.
00:47:06 But I mean, I've got walls here.
00:47:08 You're going to get a poster
00:47:09 if you pledge to a certain degree.
00:47:11 I'm going to slap down on my wall as well.
00:47:12 That will also spark joy.
00:47:14 And you know what, I'm just thinking now
00:47:15 about the fan arch that we're likely to get
00:47:18 from this OVA at some point.
00:47:20 It's going to be nuts.
00:47:21 Oh, hell yeah.
00:47:21 Like, remember Nexus's amazing art of us
00:47:24 like during the...
00:47:25 Yes, yes.
00:47:26 That was the fucking sickest shit,
00:47:28 and there will likely be more.
00:47:30 Holy shit, I can't wait.
00:47:31 I mean, what do we got?
00:47:32 We got all the lectures are coming.
00:47:34 We've got the fucking shirts and the PTA.
00:47:38 The rumble is happening.
00:47:40 The Tiki Bar, the OVA,
00:47:42 which we're packing so many fucking ideas in this OVA.
00:47:44 Have we explained what the idea for the Tiki Bar is?
00:47:48 We have explained.
00:47:49 Well, we definitely did in the Kickstarter video.
00:47:53 If you want to restate it, feel free.
00:47:54 It's just going to have drinks.
00:47:56 The general idea is like certain streams that we do
00:47:59 will be controlled by the PTA members, I think,
00:48:03 just them or just people in the chat.
00:48:06 Well, we can give the PTA...
00:48:06 You get people to drink on stream for various reasons.
00:48:11 My thought is that we can give the PTA
00:48:13 amount of control, but it should be open to the public.
00:48:16 And anyone at any time in the YouTube chat or whatever
00:48:20 will be able to...
00:48:21 If you donate...
00:48:22 There will be a menu.
00:48:23 Probably put a menu on screen.
00:48:26 If you donate an amount for a drink
00:48:29 and specify who has to drink, you can buy drinks for us
00:48:32 and force us to drink.
00:48:33 And I think that probably there should be some...
00:48:35 If someone's like, I can't drink anymore,
00:48:37 I'm going to die or I'm going to throw up or I'm too drunk,
00:48:39 you can tap out.
00:48:41 But maybe there'll be some kind of like penalty
00:48:44 associated with it.
00:48:44 I think that'd be funny.
00:48:46 Okay, I don't know what that would be exactly.
00:48:47 I don't know how legal that is, but...
00:48:49 Well, we're all...
00:48:50 Well, I mean, you can't make munchy drink.
00:48:53 Well, you also...
00:48:53 I don't know if you can legally pay someone to drink.
00:48:57 Like, can you...
00:48:58 I mean, you're buying the drink?
00:49:00 I don't know.
00:49:01 Well, if you have the option to...
00:49:03 If you have the option...
00:49:03 That's what I'm saying.
00:49:04 It's like...
00:49:05 If you have the option to say no.
00:49:06 You have the option to say no and then we kick your ass.
00:49:09 I don't know.
00:49:09 Or we throw you into the sea.
00:49:11 Just kick my ass right now.
00:49:12 I'm going to destroy that.
00:49:13 Yeah.
00:49:14 Oh, of course, it's the calendar, the Brad lecture.
00:49:16 Brad's going to be the diss track that we will have to start working on imminently.
00:49:21 And then the music video that we will produce.
00:49:24 I mean, we got to get the song out, I guess, before Radcon,
00:49:27 so that we can make the music video at Radcon.
00:49:29 And so we'll be working on that.
00:49:31 And the fucking light novel, funded, physical release,
00:49:33 coming to all 100 and plus backers.
00:49:36 So I hope that you made it in time.
00:49:38 That's going to be that.
00:49:39 Maybe we'll fucking sell copies after separately or something.
00:49:41 If people want them.
00:49:43 If they want them.
00:49:47 We could easily just sell it like through Amazon.
00:49:49 Like the Amazon printing service or whatever it is that you ever requested.
00:49:53 Yeah, god.
00:49:53 I really love internet creators with physical products that they're selling.
00:50:00 Not like t-shirts and stuff, but like, you know, comics, books.
00:50:04 It's fucking sick, dude.
00:50:06 Things that you could put on your bookshelf and say that came from an internet guy
00:50:09 that would otherwise not exist because it's hard to get published.
00:50:11 It makes it feel real so that mom and dad can finally get it after all.
00:50:17 I definitely want to get the Digi's light novel
00:50:20 and the Rotoradcon novel when I have those for real.
00:50:25 I have no idea what the Rotoradcon is going to look like,
00:50:28 because it's not long.
00:50:30 So I don't know if it's going to be like a pamphlet or...
00:50:35 It'll be a little thing.
00:50:35 It's short and sweet.
00:50:36 Like Common Sense by Thomas Paine.
00:50:39 We will secede from the union and become our own nation at Rotoradcon for Paradise.
00:50:44 It's just a bad time.
00:50:45 All right.
00:50:46 Did we say, was there like an agreement that Tom would do like the artwork if...
00:50:51 For what?
00:50:51 He did say he would do that, yeah.
00:50:54 Yeah, so you'll have to draw Jacked Punk.
00:50:56 That's really funny.
00:50:57 Yes.
00:50:59 I mean, I don't know if he's, it's exclusively going to redo the art that I've done
00:51:03 or do original art for it.
00:51:04 I have no idea.
00:51:05 We probably need some more art.
00:51:07 I don't know.
00:51:07 I don't know how it's going to work.
00:51:09 Whatever.
00:51:09 We can figure it out.
00:51:10 We got, we got options here.
00:51:12 And we've got money to do things with to make it nice.
00:51:14 Oh my God.
00:51:15 Imagine that.
00:51:16 Oh, by the way, we're at $20,294.
00:51:19 It went up again.
00:51:21 Oh my God.
00:51:21 It went up again.
00:51:22 This is like the, this is like the, the, the, remember the first time we recorded the podcast
00:51:26 after we launched the kicks.
00:51:27 Oh yeah, that's right.
00:51:28 During the stream, we were like, oh, we're up another 100.
00:51:30 Oh, we're up another 200.
00:51:33 Holy shit.
00:51:36 By the way, we are, we are, we might pass.
00:51:38 I was worried because for a while, like even though we exceeded the amount raised in the first one,
00:51:43 the number of backers was actually trailing behind the first one.
00:51:47 We had fewer for a while, but now we're catching up.
00:51:49 We had 308 the first time now.
00:51:51 That's right.
00:51:52 We're up to 291, do 292.
00:51:55 So yeah, we might end up with at least as many backers.
00:51:58 It would make me very happy to break the number of backers, just to feel like,
00:52:01 hooray, our audience has grown, even though like we are charging more.
00:52:04 I really think, yeah, the fact that we made it with literally like less backers,
00:52:09 more than twice as much money.
00:52:11 It must mean that people really liked Radcon 3.
00:52:15 Like, it was such a triumph.
00:52:16 We did everything we promised and they were all pretty great.
00:52:19 I mean, it's kind of like, it's hard to understand when it's, when it actually happens,
00:52:23 because like you do the Radcon and none of the videos get more than 5000 views.
00:52:28 And they, you know, some of them take an eternity to come out and the response is like,
00:52:34 it's a positive response.
00:52:35 But when you just see like, you know, one day worth of comments and they're just kind of like,
00:52:40 good job guys.
00:52:41 It's just like, all right, well, there it is.
00:52:44 The Radcon 3, the arena video that I slaved over with all the different GoPro footage things.
00:52:50 And like, we go around shooting each other.
00:52:52 It was really fun, really cool.
00:52:54 It's an amazing video.
00:52:55 Legitimately.
00:52:55 It didn't get much of a response though.
00:52:57 It's just sort of like, yeah, cool.
00:52:59 Oh, yeah.
00:52:59 It's like, yeah.
00:53:00 I mean, look at them, like we've got a few thousand views, like, all right.
00:53:03 The numbers don't lie when it comes to the Kickstarter.
00:53:06 You know, clearly those few people were into it.
00:53:10 You know what's interesting?
00:53:11 Like during this Kickstarter, I also noticed, maybe you guys know this as well,
00:53:16 that like another Kickstarter launched during this time.
00:53:18 The Matthew Matosis just made a video about, which is the Wonderful 101.
00:53:22 And that's already, I think it's shot past, but at a $1.5 million already.
00:53:27 And they were looking for like 90,000 to just make it happen or like 100,000 or something.
00:53:31 But then they had all these crazy tiers above that, some of which were like,
00:53:35 if they got like 2 million, then Hideki Kamiya will clear his block list on Twitter.
00:53:40 And you know, like, by the way, the lower tier was like, if you pledge like $100,
00:53:45 whatever, he will block you on Twitter.
00:53:48 That's like one of the rewards.
00:53:50 So like they're working the memes, which I respect in a big way.
00:53:53 Yeah.
00:53:54 But like that product, I think, has far more like, okay, they'll be making a game
00:54:00 that everyone can buy and everyone can play.
00:54:02 Whereas like with our thing, it's a different animal,
00:54:05 which I think just inherently has this like niche community.
00:54:09 Like people are high pledgers, are pledging to be like part of the experience
00:54:13 by being in the PTA to like shape and like the dark, the fucking dark PTA guys who are
00:54:18 going to help make like a fighter.
00:54:20 And then of course the thousand boys who are going to be in the Royal Rumble,
00:54:22 like personally or whatever.
00:54:24 That's a very different experience, I think, than just like, I don't know,
00:54:28 helping a game exist.
00:54:30 And sure you'll get a copy, but that you'd have to buy otherwise.
00:54:33 I think that there's two reasons that contributed to the high like average
00:54:40 pledge amount.
00:54:41 One, yes, people really loved Rad Country and like the people that were into it were
00:54:47 happy with the results and are looking for more of that.
00:54:50 Imagine your audience was just bigger with the same level of passion.
00:54:53 Ooh, that's a recipe for money right there.
00:54:55 Well, the other thing is that like.
00:54:57 It would require the PCP to be good at any time other than Rad Country.
00:55:01 Damn, you're right.
00:55:01 You're right about that.
00:55:02 The other thing I think is real is that like it's two years later.
00:55:06 Probably a lot of our audience has aged by two years and like probably a lot of them
00:55:10 that were like in college before are now like working.
00:55:13 Like a lot of the audience has probably grown by two years, aged up from like college
00:55:17 and entered the workforce or whatever.
00:55:19 Probably just a lot of them just have more money now.
00:55:21 Now that they have those precious Yang Bucks.
00:55:24 Now a lot of them probably have disposable income that didn't have it before.
00:55:28 That's an interesting thought.
00:55:29 Yeah.
00:55:30 Maybe some of them have just been saving with anticipation of Rad Country eventually.
00:55:36 I don't know if I would flatter myself to think that these people have been saving up for two years
00:55:40 for the specific purpose.
00:55:41 Well, we also think.
00:55:42 Fair enough.
00:55:42 Fair enough.
00:55:43 But they've probably been getting their shit in order at least to some of them.
00:55:46 Audience, I'm proud of you.
00:55:47 I'm proud of you that you've got your shit well enough in line to back Rad Country for.
00:55:51 Even proud a little bit of that guy at the beginning who pledged a thousand dollars
00:55:55 and had to drop down because he just like realized he was too much money.
00:55:58 You know, it's unfortunate that to us that looked like a dip.
00:56:02 But that's just life.
00:56:03 Good for you.
00:56:04 He provided a valuable service of getting people hype about it succeeding easily.
00:56:09 That's true.
00:56:10 That's true.
00:56:11 In a way, it helped because it was like seed money.
00:56:14 Now we're.
00:56:15 Some Kickstarter's will launch and then the creator will just like put like
00:56:19 a hundred or a thousand dollars into the project at the very beginning as like seed money.
00:56:23 And not to mention when he pulled that, we then got to play the victim card in a big way.
00:56:28 And it was wonderful.
00:56:29 I love it every time.
00:56:31 I didn't phrase the tweet to sound like too victimized.
00:56:34 But more like, oh, we've had a little setback, but we can.
00:56:37 But we're still going to make it.
00:56:38 And hey, look at this.
00:56:39 We fucking did.
00:56:40 Take a look at this.
00:56:43 Okay.
00:56:44 Take a look at what?
00:56:45 Are you linking something?
00:56:46 No.
00:56:47 Oh, it's just recording Resident Evil.
00:56:51 Well, that's how I feel.
00:56:53 We should do like a spooky mansion rad con one of these days, you know.
00:56:56 I think the next rad con should be we should do it next summer and it should be Christmas or like
00:57:02 snow themed in the summer.
00:57:04 Why do you think what do you think would be in like a new a Christmas themed?
00:57:10 I mean, I want to bring up again the idea I had for of us doing like a cabin.
00:57:17 Out in the mountains and rad conning from a cabin doable.
00:57:22 Also, let me just throw this at you, everybody.
00:57:25 We talked about this amount of money.
00:57:26 There is a 100% chance we could find a reasonably priced air and be and get tickets to somewhere
00:57:31 like, oh, I don't know, Tokyo, Japan and do one there.
00:57:35 That is possible.
00:57:36 That is 100% to go to the no question.
00:57:39 Like we have to consider now like we have to level up our understanding of what we're capable of.
00:57:44 Part of what why I thought we could reach 20k with this Kickstarter was that Ben's
00:57:50 Vapors 2 Kickstarter made so much money because Vapors 2 I think made more than twice what
00:57:55 Vapors 1 did as well, right?
00:57:58 Something like that.
00:58:01 When I had seen that and it was more than the it made more than rad con 3, right?
00:58:06 Yes, it did.
00:58:08 Redcon 3 made $9,000.
00:58:09 Redcon 2 made exactly $12,000.
00:58:14 So, yeah, like when I was looking at not pure not pure profit, by the way,
00:58:19 that's just the number.
00:58:21 When I was looking at how much the Vapors had made, I was like, well,
00:58:25 like Ben's making this much off of this like relatively obscure comic.
00:58:29 Part of it is a lot of it is the promotion and the stretch goals and the fact that you
00:58:35 created this like sort of meta narrative with the continuing stretch goals,
00:58:40 just like giving people something to do essentially.
00:58:42 And I was like, yeah, this kind of seems like representing like the full potential.
00:58:47 If Ben were to go all out on something like on a project,
00:58:52 what's the most money he could make on that?
00:58:55 And that felt like it represented that.
00:58:57 And so I looked at it and I said, okay, well, I know that my audience is way
00:59:02 the fuck bigger than Ben.
00:59:03 So like if I did something with this level of push,
00:59:07 it should be able to get even bigger numbers.
00:59:10 And like I never promoted Redcon 3 at all,
00:59:13 because I was just like lost in a whole other world while Redcon 3 was being planned.
00:59:19 But with this one, I was just like, as soon as I throw my hat in,
00:59:25 I know it will do something to bump this.
00:59:27 And since it already hit the goal right away in the first couple of days at first,
00:59:30 I was like, well, maybe I don't have to do anything.
00:59:32 And then I was like, well, like I looked over the numbers and I was like,
00:59:36 nobody wrote in, we get paid.
00:59:38 Nobody wrote that in.
00:59:39 How did that happen?
00:59:42 How did I not notice?
00:59:43 It was there for a bit.
00:59:44 And then we like with like anxiety of not getting that amount.
00:59:49 But we didn't want to ask for too much for the initial.
00:59:52 So we said, okay, what is completely necessary?
00:59:55 And we here's the dirty secret.
00:59:57 And the getting extra like paid for the time we were spending was like something we cut.
01:00:03 Here's the dirty secret that I would never have admitted until that had been funded.
01:00:08 And now you can't take your money back.
01:00:09 So you can't know that we made a bad business decision,
01:00:12 which was because we were so jazzed to it.
01:00:13 We committed our plane flights and the money to getting the Airbnb.
01:00:17 So if we hadn't done it, we would have been purely out of pocket.
01:00:21 So we had to make sure we hit that goal by any means necessary.
01:00:25 If they had launched the Kickstarter and it had made zero dollars,
01:00:27 we would be like three or like five grand in the hole.
01:00:32 Yeah.
01:00:33 It wasn't like a stupid.
01:00:34 That will never happen again.
01:00:35 I will never do that again.
01:00:37 It wasn't a stupid idea to buy the Airbnb early.
01:00:41 Because we were worried that, you know,
01:00:43 there's only so many Airbnbs that completely fit the criteria.
01:00:47 If we didn't put the money down, we would have lost it or not gotten it.
01:00:53 And then everything would have been ruined anyway.
01:00:55 So we had to get that first.
01:00:57 Not to fearmonger.
01:00:59 But like when we did RFCConK the last time, we had the B&B.
01:01:06 Munchy had the B&B all sorted out.
01:01:08 And then the guy just canceled like the day before.
01:01:13 Well, okay.
01:01:14 So I guess I sure hope that doesn't happen.
01:01:18 Surely you've got your money back at least, right?
01:01:20 Yeah.
01:01:20 Yeah.
01:01:21 But then we had 24 hours to scramble to find a new place.
01:01:25 You know what?
01:01:25 We'll roll with it.
01:01:26 We'll figure it out.
01:01:27 But I mean, we can't control for such a thing.
01:01:31 There's nothing we can do to prevent it.
01:01:32 This is like a business and they seem to know their shit.
01:01:35 So I'm pretty confident.
01:01:37 But nonetheless, nonetheless, always a fear to be...
01:01:39 Like, you see, that's the thing.
01:01:40 Terrifying.
01:01:41 But like the fact that we've now...
01:01:42 I mean, I'm much more worried about the fact that
01:01:46 what if the coronavirus airport,
01:01:50 yeah, what if they don't let given come into the country
01:01:52 by the time this happens?
01:01:54 They'll just scan me.
01:01:55 I'm not that worried about that.
01:01:56 They'll scan me like, are you gay?
01:01:59 No.
01:01:59 If he was coming from China, I'd be a little worried.
01:02:02 Are there any coronavirus reports from the UK?
01:02:04 There's...
01:02:05 Yeah, there's like one in all the countries.
01:02:08 There's eight confirmed cases.
01:02:10 No one's serious.
01:02:12 I was probably higher than that by now.
01:02:14 It's the last time I checked.
01:02:15 I know China is a big place,
01:02:17 but I know that Econ was planning to go to China.
01:02:19 Is that happen or...
01:02:21 That has not happened yet and I don't think it will.
01:02:23 Unless they open the country back up by then.
01:02:26 I was gonna say, isn't half of China in quarantine mode?
01:02:29 Yes, most of it is locked down
01:02:32 to the point that they're not allowed to leave their houses
01:02:35 and they got drones yelling at old ladies in the street to go home.
01:02:38 It's fucking hilarious and crazy.
01:02:40 That does sound really funny.
01:02:41 They're also mass burning bodies somewhere in the...
01:02:44 Yeah, that's right.
01:02:45 Somewhere out in the fields.
01:02:47 But yeah, China's a mad house right now.
01:02:49 I don't know if Econ will be able to go by, you know,
01:02:53 if it'll be reopened by the time he's gonna leave,
01:02:55 but he had said something about coming to Radcon 4.
01:02:59 Oh yeah, right, right.
01:03:01 I was having some interest in that,
01:03:02 so I assume he was gonna leave after that.
01:03:04 I'll give you one hour of our time, Econ.
01:03:06 That's how much I'll budget.
01:03:08 Then you have to be out the door.
01:03:12 Maybe we could invite Christian at the same time.
01:03:15 That sounds like a great idea.
01:03:17 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:03:17 Econ and Christian would...
01:03:18 My two favorite people.
01:03:19 They would really play off each other.
01:03:20 They would have great chemistry together.
01:03:23 I'm sure Econ would be interested in meeting Chris Chan, right?
01:03:27 I suppose that's true.
01:03:28 The funny thing is that meeting Chris is not that interesting.
01:03:31 She doesn't like...
01:03:31 Well, I mean, what do you expect?
01:03:32 She doesn't do anything.
01:03:33 Yeah, she doesn't...
01:03:34 She's funny to think about,
01:03:36 and she says funny stuff online,
01:03:38 but she doesn't do anything interesting in person.
01:03:41 It's just what you're describing.
01:03:42 It's like you're describing a toy that you bought
01:03:45 that's not that interesting.
01:03:47 Yeah, I brought it home,
01:03:48 but it's just like it doesn't really do anything.
01:03:50 It's just kind of looks funny.
01:03:51 It's like you go to the zoo,
01:03:53 and you're like, oh, I want to see the lions,
01:03:55 but then you go to the...
01:03:56 And there's just one,
01:03:57 and it's sitting there behind the bush,
01:03:59 and you tap on the glass, and you're like, hey, move.
01:04:01 It doesn't hold anything.
01:04:03 It doesn't live up to the shape.
01:04:03 But it just doesn't.
01:04:04 But it means about the stories that are told.
01:04:06 It's about the experiences.
01:04:08 A lot of it's been mythologized,
01:04:09 like the man in the pickle suit and whatnot.
01:04:12 That event was probably less entertaining
01:04:15 to see as it is to think about and just mull over.
01:04:18 I don't know.
01:04:19 A full-on pickle man costume?
01:04:22 I mean, it sounds pretty spectacular.
01:04:23 It's full of that one, maybe.
01:04:25 But like Chris probably didn't do it.
01:04:27 Chris probably just kind of froze up
01:04:29 and stood there in confusion.
01:04:31 Yeah, I would probably do the same to be fair, but yeah.
01:04:35 It reminds me of lectures.
01:04:38 I was thinking about doing a lecture or two or something,
01:04:43 and I was racking my brain trying to think,
01:04:46 what do I know that's also like a lectureable subject?
01:04:51 And I kind of came to the conclusion that
01:04:53 in order to make it a lectureable subject,
01:04:55 I would need to do an amount of research
01:04:57 that is essentially, I don't, you know.
01:05:01 That's kind of where I'm at.
01:05:02 I would need to do so much more research
01:05:05 than what is already in my brain.
01:05:06 And if it's not in my brain,
01:05:07 it's going to be a fucking nightmare.
01:05:09 And I kind of don't want to bother.
01:05:10 Let me give you an example of something.
01:05:12 Yesterday in my stream,
01:05:14 this is why I was the right man
01:05:16 to do the Kingdom Hearts lecture.
01:05:17 And it is because when I was playing Kingdom Hearts,
01:05:19 or I was doing my stream,
01:05:20 I was talking about my experience
01:05:22 of playing through the new Kingdom Hearts III DLC,
01:05:24 I went on a rant about something
01:05:27 that deeply offended me in Kingdom Hearts III's DLC.
01:05:31 And it's that, oh, these so-called scholars,
01:05:35 that, oh, they've got all this lore.
01:05:36 They know everything about the series.
01:05:38 They're such geniuses making this DLC
01:05:40 that is literally just a canon retcon
01:05:42 because they fucked up the story the first time
01:05:44 and they had to fix it with DLC.
01:05:46 These geniuses, such as Nomura,
01:05:49 in Kingdom Hearts III,
01:05:50 there's a section in the DLC
01:05:51 you can play as Roxas briefly.
01:05:53 And what they did was they gave Roxas
01:05:55 the special power from Kingdom Hearts II called reversal.
01:05:59 But here's the thing,
01:06:01 reversal was a reaction command in Kingdom Hearts II,
01:06:04 emphasis on the word reaction.
01:06:06 Because in that game,
01:06:07 reaction commands relate to the specific enemy
01:06:09 you are fighting,
01:06:10 not the character you are fucking playing
01:06:12 as, you idiot Nomura.
01:06:14 And so what he does is he makes it
01:06:15 so that when you play as Roxas,
01:06:17 you can use this reversal power,
01:06:19 which puts you behind the enemy.
01:06:21 It kind of swoos around behind him.
01:06:23 But the problem is, in Kingdom Hearts II,
01:06:24 you could do it to Dusks, to Xemnas,
01:06:27 and I believe the Twilight Thorn as well.
01:06:29 Those were the only enemies
01:06:31 with the reversal reaction command.
01:06:33 And in Kingdom Hearts III,
01:06:35 they act like it was an intrinsic power that Roxas had
01:06:38 and you could use it on enemies like Luxord
01:06:41 and Larzin, which you could never do it.
01:06:43 And it shows a fundamental misunderstanding
01:06:46 of what a reaction command is
01:06:47 and what the fucking reversal power is.
01:06:49 And that kind of knowledge.
01:06:51 And even Keyblade Spirit says,
01:06:52 wow, Nate, even I'm not this autistic about Kingdom Hearts.
01:06:57 That's why I'm the right man for the job
01:06:59 to do that lecture.
01:07:00 It's like, I don't have,
01:07:02 maybe I do,
01:07:03 but I don't have anything that,
01:07:05 like I could really make a big old lecture about
01:07:08 that would also be an interesting topping
01:07:10 that anyone would want to listen to.
01:07:13 I feel you.
01:07:13 That's where I'm stuck because...
01:07:15 I've got very few things to be fair.
01:07:17 My first idea was,
01:07:18 I wanted to talk about the five album narrative
01:07:21 of the Coheed and Cambria albums.
01:07:23 And there's a ton of comics
01:07:25 and supplementary material to read,
01:07:27 to study for that that I haven't read.
01:07:30 But like, I thought about it and I was like,
01:07:32 well, the main appeal of explaining
01:07:35 the Coheed album narrative would be
01:07:36 that I could say like,
01:07:37 all right, this song, this is what it's about.
01:07:41 You know, like this song that you've heard
01:07:43 and you know, here's what it's about.
01:07:45 But no, I don't think anybody in the PCP
01:07:47 listens to Coheed and Cambria at all.
01:07:49 So it'd be me lecturing you guys and being like,
01:07:52 okay, well, when he says this lyric,
01:07:54 it's like, you don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
01:07:56 So I was like, maybe that's not such a good idea
01:07:58 for this context.
01:08:00 It could be because I knew nothing about guilty gear
01:08:03 and Tom's lecture was engaging just for the...
01:08:06 It was good.
01:08:07 For the things he was explaining as he went.
01:08:10 The thing about it is that like,
01:08:12 you know, the actual...
01:08:15 It's that the actual experience of the Coheed and Cambria albums
01:08:19 is not the same as the story.
01:08:21 And so what makes the story interesting as a deep dive
01:08:24 is that you can have a different experience than the albums.
01:08:28 So like, you won't get a sense of what this music sounds like
01:08:31 or what the actual lyrics are or...
01:08:33 No doubt, no doubt.
01:08:34 Any of that if I just tell you the story.
01:08:36 And the story isn't inherently interesting.
01:08:40 It's interesting that this story is being told
01:08:42 in this incredibly bizarre way through these lyrics and music.
01:08:46 You know?
01:08:47 Yeah, you're right.
01:08:48 That doesn't sound like a great format for...
01:08:50 It has to be a wacky, crazy story told in a wacky, crazy way.
01:08:54 Yeah, I mean, the story is...
01:08:55 That's what made the Guilty Gear lecture,
01:08:57 because like, yeah, the story of Guilty Gear
01:08:59 is not analogous to playing the games,
01:09:01 but it is just weird in its own right.
01:09:03 The story of the Cohed Albums is also insane.
01:09:06 It's completely fucked up.
01:09:07 Oh, well, sure.
01:09:07 Okay, then fair enough.
01:09:08 So it would be entertaining in that sense,
01:09:11 but like, to me, the intrigue of the story is like,
01:09:14 you hear these lyrics that mean ostensibly nothing,
01:09:19 and then you look into them,
01:09:21 and it's like this massive sci-fi fucking war story,
01:09:23 and you're like, what the fuck?
01:09:24 Like, this is what you were talking about.
01:09:27 This seems like it would be best told in like,
01:09:29 YouTube video format to me, where you clip.
01:09:31 This reminds me of, okay.
01:09:34 I think it would be a good lecture.
01:09:35 It just would have to be in front of people
01:09:37 who know the music.
01:09:38 I might be exposing my ignorance here,
01:09:40 because I don't know anything about K-Pop,
01:09:44 except that I see it on Twitter all the fucking time,
01:09:46 and I'll be looking at a seemingly normal thread,
01:09:49 and then suddenly K-Pop gifts start getting posted,
01:09:51 and I check out because I'm like,
01:09:53 I'm not gonna understand anything that's being said from now on.
01:09:56 When I posted about how my grandma just died,
01:09:58 and that guy replied with,
01:09:59 should've stand Bu Jung Po, or whatever,
01:10:02 I was like, I mean, fair enough,
01:10:03 she did not stand that guy.
01:10:05 Maybe that would've done it, as they usually post.
01:10:08 I don't know why, but I clicked on the Wikipedia article
01:10:11 for BTS the other day,
01:10:13 and apparently they also have like,
01:10:15 a alternate reality storyline going on.
01:10:19 Okay, that sounds kind of interesting.
01:10:22 There's tons and tons of stuff
01:10:23 that I think would fit the lecture format well.
01:10:25 It's just like a matter of,
01:10:27 will this be interesting to people
01:10:29 who don't know what it is already?
01:10:32 And in the case of Coheed, I think it could be,
01:10:34 there's an entertaining lecture
01:10:35 that could be done just about the story,
01:10:37 but it would not be as interesting
01:10:39 as comparing it to the lyrics
01:10:41 and being able to mind expansion people who know them.
01:10:44 The other idea I had, and the problem with this one
01:10:48 is it would require even more research on my part,
01:10:52 but it wouldn't be too hard to do, is Toho.
01:10:55 Oh, that's a great idea.
01:10:56 Great idea.
01:10:57 That is a good one, yeah.
01:10:59 But the problem with Toho is that there's not really
01:11:04 a ton of official narrative that's that interesting
01:11:08 to dive into.
01:11:10 Mostly it's about the characters,
01:11:12 and I mean, there are a ton of official stories
01:11:15 and weird details about them,
01:11:16 but it would be like, when it comes to the fan content,
01:11:19 it's like there's nowhere to start.
01:11:21 It's endless.
01:11:22 There's more fan content for Toho
01:11:23 than anything else on the planet.
01:11:25 So yeah, I don't know.
01:11:27 I think someone could work in,
01:11:29 someone could definitely make a good Toho lecture
01:11:31 that would probably be skeleton around.
01:11:33 You go through the games from start to finish.
01:11:35 You talk about Zune's life and stuff,
01:11:37 and then as relevant characters come up,
01:11:39 you just tell anecdotes about what this character has done.
01:11:42 That one seems like a really, really strong idea for a lecture.
01:11:46 Yes.
01:11:47 The only problem with it is that I have no fucking idea
01:11:49 about Toho lecture, and I'm in these circles personally.
01:11:51 That's just guilty gear.
01:11:53 Everybody knows it, but probably how many people
01:11:55 actually know what the fuck it's about.
01:11:57 And here's the thing.
01:11:57 When it comes to these lectures,
01:12:00 I like when we do them about these super autistic things
01:12:03 because most of their fans can't explain that all.
01:12:06 True.
01:12:07 They're so into it that they don't know
01:12:08 how to communicate about it,
01:12:10 and if you go to Toho panels at Otacon or something,
01:12:14 they're fucking incomprehensible.
01:12:16 Even for me, with a surface-level understanding,
01:12:19 because the people at them know everything,
01:12:22 it's just constant references and obscure left hooks
01:12:26 and just rambling, incoherent,
01:12:28 nonsense and shouting about the characters.
01:12:30 Just a bunch of people who are really excited about Toho
01:12:34 spurring the fuck out about Toho.
01:12:36 And there's no way to get a grasp
01:12:40 on what the hell you're experiencing in that context.
01:12:43 Yeah.
01:12:43 Yeah.
01:12:44 And even if you do know Toho, for someone like me,
01:12:47 and this is why I would have to do a lot of research to do it,
01:12:50 there's always new games and new characters coming out.
01:12:53 So like most people probably know the main characters
01:12:57 from like Imperishable Knight.
01:12:59 From Reimu's upcoming inclusion in Super Smash Brothers
01:13:03 and the new DLC pack, that's going to be the one.
01:13:05 But like there's just fucking hundreds of characters,
01:13:07 you know, there's so many to go through
01:13:09 and so many side stories and manga and all that extra shit.
01:13:12 So I don't know.
01:13:12 Monkey's Pod choice.
01:13:14 All right, you get your PCP lecture about Toho,
01:13:17 ladies and gentlemen, listening at home,
01:13:19 but it's done by a man who I know could do it,
01:13:21 who has the skills, Econ.
01:13:23 Guest lecture from Econ about Toho.
01:13:25 I honestly don't even think Econ would be willing to
01:13:28 because of how much research he would think he would have to do.
01:13:31 I think he has the knowledge to do it,
01:13:32 but I mean, no, he's not going to do it.
01:13:33 He wouldn't, unlike, the reason that,
01:13:37 okay, this is why I'm so worried about me doing it,
01:13:40 is that like there is a standard of research
01:13:42 that I would approach it with,
01:13:44 which is enough to tell somebody who doesn't know about Toho
01:13:48 as much as they need to know to become interested.
01:13:51 Anybody who already knows about Toho will look at me and say,
01:13:55 you motherfucker, you got this wrong, this wrong,
01:13:58 you didn't go into this,
01:13:59 like there's all these extra details you could have talked about.
01:14:01 Toho is exactly that kind of community.
01:14:03 It's exactly that kind of community.
01:14:05 They're extremely hardcore, they're very opinionated.
01:14:09 So like, that's scary.
01:14:10 If you started something like that,
01:14:12 that's a very real possibility,
01:14:13 but if you started with, like, this is designed to be,
01:14:16 look, this is Toho 101.
01:14:18 It doesn't matter if you say that.
01:14:19 If we get the 50,000 Kickstarter, we'll do Toho 102,
01:14:22 and that's the advanced course.
01:14:25 I would probably keep it to just official canon.
01:14:27 That would be the easiest way to have...
01:14:28 Honestly, dude, the best way to get the most views,
01:14:30 you have like an hour long, maybe two hour long lecture on Toho,
01:14:33 and you include shit like,
01:14:34 why is Chirono associated with Nine?
01:14:37 Why is she a baka?
01:14:38 And then you'll explain that kind of shit.
01:14:39 That's all the stuff, yeah.
01:14:40 Basically what I would probably do is go through each game,
01:14:43 explain each character,
01:14:44 all the like, most famous lore pieces
01:14:47 and where they came from about those characters
01:14:49 that are like, tied to the actual narrative.
01:14:51 That's a million view video right there is what that is.
01:14:54 Somebody making that, I think.
01:14:55 If the Christian, well, maybe 500,000, I don't know,
01:14:58 but that one's got legs.
01:15:00 That one's got legs.
01:15:01 I might do it, but that's probably the best idea I've had
01:15:04 other than the co-heed lectures so far.
01:15:07 So, and I'm also curious if anybody listening
01:15:10 or if any of you guys just has ideas for things
01:15:13 that you know I know about that you would want to lecture.
01:15:17 What spawned this whole lecture series
01:15:19 was literally that Ben would just tell stories
01:15:21 about Christian all the time.
01:15:23 And I said, you need to lecture us about,
01:15:25 I really want you to just sit us down
01:15:27 and like blackpill me on Christian
01:15:28 because I don't know enough to have context
01:15:30 for what the hell you're talking about.
01:15:31 So, I don't know, because you do.
01:15:34 So I educated the whole world.
01:15:36 I do talk about a lot of the things that you,
01:15:39 you know, like at length in videos and stuff.
01:15:42 So like, is there really even that much stuff
01:15:45 that you haven't talked about that you could do in a lecture?
01:15:50 It's hard to say because it's hard to know what stuff like,
01:15:54 maybe there's something that I have talked about it,
01:15:58 but not nearly at the depth I could, you know,
01:16:01 or just haven't at all like, there's certain subjects.
01:16:04 I mean, again, like say the co-heed and Cambria album narrative,
01:16:08 like I haven't talked about that.
01:16:10 Well, you know about a lot of music stuff.
01:16:12 I don't know really anything about rap.
01:16:16 What is rap?
01:16:18 Death Grips is not a bad one.
01:16:19 Death Grips, I do have a video about,
01:16:21 and there's not that much to go into
01:16:24 because a lot of their thing is that
01:16:25 they're just very mysterious.
01:16:26 So, you know, they don't have like a,
01:16:29 there's like all the little legendary things
01:16:31 they did at the start of their career,
01:16:32 but at this point, they basically just,
01:16:34 every year a new album drops out of nowhere
01:16:37 and you go, oh shit, new Death Grips.
01:16:39 You know, this would be redundant
01:16:40 because I actually just watched a video about it,
01:16:42 but it does strike me as a story
01:16:43 that would work well for the formula,
01:16:45 which is just the life and times of one John McAfee
01:16:48 and all the adventures that he's been up to.
01:16:50 I mean, that's a perfect story.
01:16:52 I want to watch a video about it.
01:16:53 I watched that four part by that one dude
01:16:54 who interviewed him after it was done.
01:16:56 I don't know what you're talking about.
01:16:57 I don't know his name, Michelle pulled it up for me,
01:16:59 but I mean, it was really funny.
01:17:01 And actually that guy clearly was biased against John McAfee.
01:17:05 And the whole time I couldn't help but be like,
01:17:07 you know, John McAfee may be responsible
01:17:09 for a few people dying and stuff,
01:17:11 but like, at least he's not a pussy like you, dude.
01:17:12 At least he's like not a little bitch, you know.
01:17:16 I, McAfee is definitely one of my, one of my heroes.
01:17:20 He's a libertarian God on this earth, no doubt about it.
01:17:22 I will be writing him in on the ballot
01:17:25 if Pete Buttigieg is the pick for the Democratic Party.
01:17:30 It's looking pretty unlikely that Pete's gone.
01:17:32 We don't know about it, we have no idea.
01:17:35 We don't.
01:17:35 Well, like fucking Bloomberg keeps rising in the, in the bedding odds.
01:17:39 Super Tuesday, baby.
01:17:40 He hasn't, he hasn't, he hasn't even been on a single ballot yet.
01:17:44 So like it remains a complete like hypothetical at this point.
01:17:48 Nobody knows.
01:17:49 Is he trying to, so is he running independent or for the DNC?
01:17:52 No, he's running, literal Democrat, Pete Bloomberg
01:17:56 is running as a Democrat.
01:17:58 And then all these people were like, Bernie's not even a,
01:18:01 Bernie's not even a real Democrat.
01:18:03 Bernie's not even a real Democrat.
01:18:04 He hasn't been vetted.
01:18:05 Bloomberg, literal Republican comes in, runs on a Democratic ticket
01:18:09 and everyone's like, yes.
01:18:10 All the media shows are like, yes, let's get behind fucking Bloomberg.
01:18:13 I mean, Bloomberg, the fact that they, they,
01:18:15 he clearly pays people to talk about him.
01:18:18 Like even in the debates, they've brought him up.
01:18:20 Admittedly, admittedly.
01:18:21 Like it was obvious that they had been paid to bring him up
01:18:25 because they like quote him like in a, it was ridiculous.
01:18:28 But how does he, how could he get the Democratic candidacy?
01:18:33 Like who's, he hasn't been voted on anywhere.
01:18:36 Like how does one become this position without participating?
01:18:39 I mean, I think the idea is just to saturate the media
01:18:42 and saturate the mainstream media and the airwaves and commercials
01:18:45 with like Bloomberg propaganda
01:18:47 and then hopefully like win big on Super Tuesday.
01:18:50 I think that's his plan.
01:18:52 Is he even included in the polls that they do?
01:18:55 Like he will be.
01:18:56 Was he in the Iowa pockets at all?
01:18:58 He's waiting for it.
01:19:00 He was.
01:19:00 Well look, like the reason why the early states matter
01:19:03 is because it sets the tone for who's going to win.
01:19:06 But if you can just manufacture good tone
01:19:09 for the upcoming states that truly do matter,
01:19:12 you like theoretically you could bypass it.
01:19:14 It hasn't really been done much,
01:19:15 but it's, you know, in theory it's possible.
01:19:17 And that's what he's banking on, I think.
01:19:19 Although some people think he's not actually trying to win,
01:19:21 but it's just trying to, I don't know, fuck shit up in a good way.
01:19:26 Word is going around that he might name Hillary as his VP.
01:19:31 I heard about that.
01:19:32 Which, yeah.
01:19:34 Oh, what if he then retires?
01:19:35 He then gives up the mantle of president at last.
01:19:37 Retires immediately.
01:19:39 Immediately.
01:19:39 He's like, yeah, Rizan.
01:19:41 That's probably exactly what would happen.
01:19:44 She's going in the back door.
01:19:45 Holy shit.
01:19:45 And even please make it happen, Mike.
01:19:47 I guess now might be a time to briefly mention
01:19:51 that yes, Bernie won New Hampshire.
01:19:53 Very exciting.
01:19:54 If you're hearing this on Friday,
01:19:56 tomorrow, Saturday, is the day of the Nevada caucuses.
01:20:00 So if you're in Nevada, get out and vote for Bernie.
01:20:04 Good night, sweet yang.
01:20:06 Good night.
01:20:07 Do not realign yourself to any other candidate.
01:20:09 If Bernie is unviable, unlikely, but a possibility,
01:20:12 just go home.
01:20:13 I mean, I've been hearing these things
01:20:15 about clobementum going on, though.
01:20:17 And I gotta say, I'm liking what I'm hearing.
01:20:20 The purple shirt.
01:20:21 It is, in fact, clober in time.
01:20:24 Clober in time.
01:20:29 Shout out to Bevan for his incredible image.
01:20:31 Oh, because she looks like the Hulk.
01:20:34 She's tiny.
01:20:35 But she's sturdy, though.
01:20:37 She's stout.
01:20:37 She's sturdily built.
01:20:39 Like a female dwarf.
01:20:40 We're talking about a quivering a little bit.
01:20:44 Yeah.
01:20:45 Yeah, she's always quivering a little bit
01:20:48 on the debate stage.
01:20:49 Sometimes she's just vibrating, like a hummingbird.
01:20:52 That's that clobementum.
01:20:53 She's just raring to go.
01:20:54 She's got to hit gas.
01:20:56 She could barely contain the forward motion.
01:21:02 All right.
01:21:03 Vote for Bernie, everybody.
01:21:04 There you go.
01:21:05 There's the message.
01:21:05 Are we ready to move to voicemails then?
01:21:07 Oh, wait, before we do that,
01:21:09 let's talk about my problematic tweet
01:21:11 where I insinuate that right people don't think.
01:21:15 Okay, sure.
01:21:16 Oh, there is the response to my tweet.
01:21:18 Yeah.
01:21:19 She also tells what it said, first of all.
01:21:20 Great tweet.
01:21:21 My tweet.
01:21:22 All right.
01:21:22 Well, my tweet was a retweet from Rational Disconnect
01:21:26 with a screenshot of a Louder with Crowder video
01:21:31 called Exposed, Buttigieg's leftist extremism, 108K views.
01:21:37 And I said, there is no skill floor for being conservative,
01:21:41 meaning that you can be as dumb and as wrong
01:21:44 and as thoughtless as you want.
01:21:45 And nobody on the right cares
01:21:47 as long as you are appealing to their basic sense of fear
01:21:52 and disgust, and they will eat it up
01:21:55 and you will make a million dollars.
01:21:58 And that was my tweet.
01:21:58 How could someone say something so brave?
01:22:01 Yeah.
01:22:02 Thank you.
01:22:03 Thank you.
01:22:03 Controversial.
01:22:05 Yeah, I have no issue with that.
01:22:06 Certainly.
01:22:07 Yeah.
01:22:07 Within the Rational Disconnect.
01:22:08 But then I follow it up with a thought I had been having,
01:22:13 which is what I say is it literally does seem to be
01:22:16 that the difference between the left and right political
01:22:19 persuasion is the amount of thinking you do.
01:22:22 It's not even that all people on the right are stupid.
01:22:25 They just don't bother thinking about things.
01:22:27 First impressions.
01:22:28 Well, hang on.
01:22:29 Your first tweet was just that first sentence.
01:22:30 No.
01:22:31 All this is...
01:22:31 No, it was the whole...
01:22:32 No, he's still...
01:22:32 This is the tweet.
01:22:34 First impressions and gut reactions are often wrong.
01:22:37 And that was my tweet.
01:22:39 And the...
01:22:40 Oh, did you not read it?
01:22:42 Did you get triggered?
01:22:43 I thought I only saw the first half.
01:22:47 No, I just didn't realize.
01:22:48 Okay, whoops.
01:22:49 Yeah, well, I agree.
01:22:51 You don't...
01:22:52 It's a gut reaction to be a reactionary conservative.
01:22:57 It's like, oh, I don't like this.
01:22:58 Yeah, it's literally the exact same on both sides.
01:23:00 It is kind of the...
01:23:01 Yeah, that was the thing I realized off the board.
01:23:04 All of it is the exact same.
01:23:06 There's no difference at all.
01:23:07 I will admit that you can be a liberal,
01:23:09 that you can be a shit-lib without thinking about anything.
01:23:12 I mean, you just like, oh, Trump's mean online.
01:23:13 You can be good or bad of either.
01:23:17 It is the case.
01:23:20 The left, the real left is data-driven.
01:23:25 The thing that I was trying to get at was...
01:23:26 We love data.
01:23:26 We love facts.
01:23:27 We love logic.
01:23:28 We love rational...
01:23:30 Oh, R-L-Y.
01:23:33 Yes, one hundo.
01:23:35 The thing...
01:23:35 All right, I have been getting really into...
01:23:39 Last time I talked about bread tube and philosophy tube
01:23:42 and country points and stuff, and I've been feeling really left,
01:23:46 really cuck-lib, cuck-loser.
01:23:48 Like, I played Dark Souls 2, and I liked it.
01:23:51 You got to take a little of each medicine.
01:23:56 You got to mix some up.
01:23:57 I watched the ladder with Crowder video.
01:24:03 I watched a full-on ladder with Crowder video.
01:24:05 You don't need to watch Stephen Crowder.
01:24:07 All right, fucking...
01:24:09 Could you let me finish the thing I was saying?
01:24:11 Yeah.
01:24:12 All right, so I've been getting more left, just ideas in my brain
01:24:17 that I didn't have before.
01:24:18 And what I was realizing was that a lot of social justice stuff,
01:24:22 when presented not as stark, raving, mad, crazy, feminist, screeching,
01:24:28 it actually...
01:24:28 Like, a lot of the things make sense.
01:24:31 Things like white privilege that I would have assumed.
01:24:33 Oh, that's complete bullshit, because it's said by people who are crazy.
01:24:38 The people who I see in videos by Thunderfoot and stuff like that.
01:24:42 And I still like Thunderfoot.
01:24:43 I like his videos.
01:24:44 I like the Amazing Atheist.
01:24:45 I like the Razor Fist, the Rageaholic.
01:24:52 But these new ideas, which I previously dismissed out of hand,
01:25:01 it was sort of a revelation to me that I thought this whole time...
01:25:06 I had the same revelation.
01:25:07 I had the same one.
01:25:09 It's so funny to hear you guys say this because of the fact
01:25:11 that I come from this and have moved in the direction of appreciating the other side,
01:25:17 and being like, oh, these guys aren't slobbering morons on this other side.
01:25:21 It really just depends on where you started.
01:25:24 Like, I started with the Amazing Atheist, and he'd made fun of feminists and Christians and all that.
01:25:32 So it's like, this is my default position.
01:25:35 I believed it because I didn't have any reason to doubt it, and I thought it was funny.
01:25:39 And then in the future, there's this conflict, and I choose a side.
01:25:44 And now I realize that there's no point choosing a side.
01:25:48 You're stupid if you stick with the side that you first went into,
01:25:56 instead of exploring the other one with genuine curiosity and open-mindedness.
01:26:02 Because I used to think I was open-minded,
01:26:05 but I would dismiss things that are like, oh, that's stupid.
01:26:10 You know, I've got an open mind, but only if they have a good idea.
01:26:14 But they don't have any good ideas, because I saw them as screeching idiots.
01:26:19 So really, what I was was not open-minded, because I hadn't looked at what they were
01:26:23 actually saying before casting my judgment.
01:26:26 I had believed I was open-minded just because I wasn't, you know,
01:26:32 I assumed that because some of it told me that this is stupid, I was like, yeah,
01:26:39 okay, I get it now.
01:26:41 And I didn't get it.
01:26:42 And it's just a cool to be a person who takes all the pieces and puts them together
01:26:53 and then makes a decision.
01:26:54 I was having a Twitter discussion, I think it was yesterday, about South Park.
01:27:00 Someone made a tweet about the damage to the discourse that South Park had done,
01:27:04 or something, and I agreed with it.
01:27:06 And someone disagreed, and we had a pretty civil discussion about it.
01:27:13 And my point was just that, yeah, I'm pretty sure.
01:27:16 I remember being influenced by media-like, media-like,
01:27:21 centrist media like South Park that says both sides are dumb.
01:27:24 And I didn't mention these, but also like, yeah, like a reaction channel.
01:27:27 It's not centrist to say both sides are dumb.
01:27:30 It is, though.
01:27:31 That's what centrism is.
01:27:34 I feel like we've been over this, but...
01:27:37 We had a whole fucking video, YouTube discussion on it, over on StComics.
01:27:42 What'scentrum.com?
01:27:43 What's centrism?
01:27:45 Maybe I should look into this, this new way of thinking.
01:27:50 It's just that there's, to say that it is center, I don't want to get into it.
01:27:57 That's a good definition.
01:27:59 It's like, oh, left, right?
01:28:00 No, they're both dumb.
01:28:01 Well, yeah, the thing, you know, it's silly and reductive,
01:28:06 but it's kind of unavoidable to contain all of the policies considered left
01:28:11 and considered right and call them one thing, and you are on one side or the other.
01:28:15 Absolutely.
01:28:16 So that's the real issue there.
01:28:17 Someone was talking about, I think Tom said a thing about like gun control,
01:28:21 like two, at least something, something gun control.
01:28:23 And I said, well, I know that gun rights are generally considered a right-wing thing,
01:28:28 but like Marx himself was super high on like that.
01:28:32 You already broke it.
01:28:33 It already makes no sense, right?
01:28:34 Left and right makes no sense.
01:28:36 You don't even have to finish the sentence.
01:28:38 They don't make no sense.
01:28:39 They have a general sense.
01:28:41 They have a logic behind them.
01:28:44 I'm saying that there is, yeah, they're in some issues, there is crossover,
01:28:47 because if you're a hardcore lefty, Marx himself was very pro-gun.
01:28:50 If you find yourself in a position of, I agree with, like half of my stances are left-wing,
01:28:56 and half of them are right-wing, by the way, they're constructed currently.
01:29:00 This somehow makes me a centrist for thinking that people on either extreme are wrong,
01:29:06 even though I'm not in between the two.
01:29:09 I feel strongly one way or another about each issue.
01:29:12 I'm not in the center, you know?
01:29:15 I just think in practice, such a person is like
01:29:18 fantastically unlikely.
01:29:20 There are some issues that I think the figure of.
01:29:21 No, I think that such a person is almost everybody,
01:29:24 and that all of us just make tons of compromises on shit that we're not sure about,
01:29:29 or don't care that much about, because we want the issues we actually care about.
01:29:32 I think that most people are single-topic votes.
01:29:35 I think that if you really have put a lot of introspection into these things,
01:29:38 you will find that you have a tendency in one direction or another.
01:29:42 I think there's a general...
01:29:43 And you might not agree with everyone who shares your tendencies on everything.
01:29:46 The policies that you hold, the things you agree with could be on one side or the other,
01:29:51 and then there's the level to which you are engaged in politics in general.
01:29:56 I feel like people who are like, what's the word for somewhat radical?
01:30:01 If you are radically on the left or the right,
01:30:04 that doesn't necessarily mean that you are with all of these specific policies,
01:30:09 but some of them you are very far on that side.
01:30:13 Let me put it this way.
01:30:14 You can be, to be a centrist, I think is implied that you're not heavily one way
01:30:23 or the other in terms of a political direction that you're trying to go for.
01:30:30 The reason this is so confusing.
01:30:31 The policy is separate, I think.
01:30:34 Okay. It can't be separate, because policy is what defines the parties are.
01:30:37 I guess it can't be separate, but I feel like there maybe is a trend.
01:30:40 I don't have a position on what centrism is. I'm just trying to figure it out.
01:30:46 Well, that's what I'm trying to say. It doesn't make sense, because the problem is,
01:30:50 if I were retreading the argument I had with Ben, but if I were to say that I felt
01:30:56 very passionately pro-gun ownership rights, which is considered a right-wing position in America,
01:31:03 and also I'm extremely pro-abortion rights, which is considered an extremely left-wing
01:31:08 issue in America, then I now cannot wholesale throw my hat in with either of those parties,
01:31:14 each of which is going to take away something I care about. If I sincerely cared about both
01:31:18 these things, I am now in a third party, because I want them both. To call that a center party,
01:31:27 the only reason that those things are construed as left or right is that they just so happen
01:31:31 to fall into the bubble of people who tend to have certain other beliefs, but there's no
01:31:37 real correlation between them other than that. People by and large are willing to throw some
01:31:43 things under the bus, or they just don't care, because they care more about other issues. In
01:31:48 my case, growing up, I was very... I'm a freedom of speech person, and that's the reason I'm in
01:31:55 such a weird position, because growing up, liberal meant freedom of speech protector. That was a big
01:32:00 part of the party's identity. The conservatives were always trying to take shit away from us,
01:32:05 take away what we could say. Now, I don't know if it actually is the opposite now, but it feels
01:32:11 that way, because it feels like the liberals are the ones taking away what we can say.
01:32:15 The shit-lives and their id-pole shit is very anti-free speech. I agree that it is a big problem.
01:32:24 I think that that's what leads. I think that that identitarianism is what leads to this,
01:32:28 because people so badly want to have an identity of being with this party. As long as this party
01:32:35 supports the one issue they care about, they will tow the party line on all the other shit
01:32:40 and just assume that what the party thinks is true and correct. The way that people talk about
01:32:45 the whole AR-15, the automatic rifle with 15 rounds information, it's so easy for that to
01:32:53 spread through democratic circles, because they will just lap up anything that their side says
01:32:59 with just, they just don't care about gun rights, so they just say, oh, the Dems hate it, so I hate
01:33:05 it too. Their arguments make sense, ergo, I agree, but then you actually go listen to some Republican
01:33:12 voters who really care about gun rights, who do not care about abortion. They're like, yeah,
01:33:17 that should be legal, whatever. I don't care, but I'm voting Republican because they're not
01:33:20 taking my guns. When you talk to somebody like that, you think, okay, so most of these people
01:33:25 voting, they don't really have an opinion on most of these issues that are getting thrown in with
01:33:31 their party, and I think that if more people were, if we had something like alternative vote,
01:33:39 as I'm always saying, and we could have third parties that were viable, I think more people
01:33:44 would gravitate towards third parties that strip away the things that you don't like about
01:33:48 neither of the main parties, and just focus on a coalition of things that creates you in your
01:33:55 perspective. It is definitely stupid to have left and right. The only reason it has any value,
01:34:03 quote unquote value, is that at the moment we're in a two-party system, which generally goes left,
01:34:08 right. Well, I don't think that's the only reason. Well, yeah, I mean, the thought that generally
01:34:15 people of a certain persuasion think certain different policies are like, I like that section
01:34:21 of policies. Here's what I think about the hypothetical of a person who's very pro-gun,
01:34:28 very pro-abortion. I think if you are someone who, those are the only two opinions you have,
01:34:34 and you don't interrogate why you have them any further than that, sure. Then it would be
01:34:39 impossible for you to draw any ideological line for yourself and be like, oh, these are my,
01:34:45 these are my overarching beliefs. But if you think about, you could have those things,
01:34:52 and then you might think about why do you have them, and if you think about your underlying
01:34:56 beliefs that underpin those and cause you to think that way, I think what generally what you find is
01:35:01 people are inclined to one of two lines of thought. You either favor egalitarianism or you're in
01:35:05 favor of hierarchy. People tend to fall into these two camps. People have these two patterns of
01:35:11 thought that are diverged from each other. Causing everybody to fall. For me,
01:35:16 as a voter, I have nothing that draws me to either the Democrat or Republican side as like,
01:35:23 oh, this makes them better than the other one, so I need to vote for them. There's nothing I feel
01:35:31 that they are saying that makes me feel that way. I was arguing with a hashtag still voting
01:35:40 Yang. Those people, I don't understand that. I don't. It's kind of disappointing, but I think a
01:35:45 lot of them are probably like former Republicans or libertarians who went Yang, so I'm like, I'm
01:35:51 not too sorry to lose their vote. But anyway, I was arguing with one and she was sent, she was,
01:35:56 you know, no, actually, no, this was a Bernie or Buster. I had, it doesn't matter. But I said like,
01:36:01 like, I won't, I won't vote for Bloomberg, but, but I would probably vote for most of the Dems
01:36:06 if they got, I'm not, I'm not full on Bernie or Buster, but I'm also not full on vote no matter
01:36:10 who. I'm a centrist about it. But, but I was saying, I was saying, she was, I said, like, you know,
01:36:18 I know I hate Hillary, everybody hates Hillary, but like the fact of the matter is like, for example,
01:36:22 if we'd had Hillary for the last four years, it wouldn't have been great, but we would probably
01:36:27 be closer to Medicare for all or a decent public option, like, and we would have a better like,
01:36:31 we would have gotten better picks for the, for the Supreme Court and stuff like this.
01:36:36 See, I don't know all that stuff. We wouldn't have been happy about it, but we would have been,
01:36:40 we would be, we would be materially better off. That's the kind of thing that I view as like this
01:36:43 weird party think mind poison, because it's like, we could have got better seats. I don't know who
01:36:48 the fuck Hillary would have picked. Like, yeah, maybe they would have been Democrats, maybe in
01:36:52 some vague way that would get us closer to some ideals that I don't even really care about or
01:36:57 believe in anyways, but like, I just can't, I can't visualize in my mind this world in which
01:37:04 things were better because Hillary became president. Like, I, Hillary, for all her faults,
01:37:10 she was running on a platform of like expanding on the Affordable Care Act and stuff. For all
01:37:15 her faults, Hillary was pushing a, she was pro like expansion of the Affordable Care Act and like a
01:37:21 strong public health care option, which is a thing that I agree with. See, that's a topic that I
01:37:27 have no particular stance on. I feel like both arguments have a lot of strength and water.
01:37:35 Like, I've heard, I've heard both sides talk about it and I go, okay, I understand the issues.
01:37:41 Like, neither solution sounds like obvious to me. Neither one is like, oh, this will definitely
01:37:47 make things better, might make things different, could be interesting, might be worth a shake up.
01:37:52 But you know, like the level of like confidence that people feel and like, oh, if my guy wins,
01:37:57 things will get better. And it's like, if your guy wins, things will move very marginally in a
01:38:03 direction that will likely be counterbalanced in the next cycle as it usually is. Like,
01:38:08 this is, this is what I say. This is what I say to people that like scoff at Bernie and say like,
01:38:13 oh, well, you know, Medicare for all is too hard. It'll never get passed. And it's like, okay,
01:38:17 you even, let's assume you're right. Let's assume you're correct about that. And Bernie will not
01:38:22 will not be able to fully deliver on everything he says he wants to do, which,
01:38:26 you know, is the case for most presidents because they get thwarted by Congress because
01:38:30 separation of powers, this is how it's designed. And that's fine. I just, the reason I'm, I don't
01:38:36 care about that is because, sure, but at least he's a guy who will be pushing things in the,
01:38:41 he will at least be pushing in the direction that I want things to go in, even if we don't get all
01:38:45 the way there. It's better than having someone like Trump or like Buttigieg or even Biden or
01:38:50 someone who is going to be like way more, even if like, even if someone like Biden like wants,
01:38:56 like, I know that he would prefer that like more people be insured, right? Like, even though I
01:39:01 like expanding the American, the affordable character, I don't think is the best way we should
01:39:04 just go full on fucking socialized medicine. But even if like, he's not going to be pushing as hard,
01:39:10 right? Even if he's generally going the way I want, Bernie, Bernie goes harder for it.
01:39:14 We're going so far into the weeds and that's what I want, ideologically and materially discussion
01:39:19 than usual though. Yeah. But where I kind of want to back it out to is, I guess what frustrates
01:39:25 me about political discourse is that people have a tendency to look at things within the framework
01:39:30 of how they operate currently. People look at it like, like the Iowa caucuses, they matter because
01:39:37 of these like precedents of what they mean, you know? And so everybody gets excited about it and
01:39:41 we talk about it. But then particularly this year, like the Iowa caucus was a complete fucking joke
01:39:47 the results essentially mean nothing because of how badly it was cocked up.
01:39:53 Incidentally, I didn't know this, but apparently in 2016, Nevada was like an equally big debacle.
01:39:58 I didn't know this, but apparently in 2016, the Nevada caucus, the one that's coming out
01:40:03 this Saturday, the ones happening this Saturday, was an equally huge debacle and a nightmare rigged
01:40:08 by the fucking DNC. They stole it from Bernie. But less people were paying attention at that point.
01:40:14 Probably yes. So anyway, that's the one that's happening this Saturday, so I'm looking forward
01:40:19 to another night. When it comes to these caucuses and everything, people are paying all this attention
01:40:22 to it and like saying all this stuff about like what it means. And it's like, that all assumes
01:40:29 that the precedent will be kept to, but the precedent doesn't have to be kept to, it could
01:40:35 be completely subverted. Like Bloomberg currently is trying to completely subvert the precedent.
01:40:40 He's just using money to try and put his name in front of people and just get in. And Trump,
01:40:46 in many ways, what made Trump succeed was that he went outside the boundaries of what other
01:40:51 candidates were doing. He was using the internet. He was using memes. He is just way more blunt and
01:40:57 upfront than other presidents. He does not care about like maintaining this uber professional,
01:41:04 sanitary presentation that recent presidents, particularly Obama, have had. He rejected
01:41:11 all that because his thought process is, well, this may be the way that everyone's doing it,
01:41:17 but it's not the only way it can be done. And I can prove that. And he was so controversial for
01:41:24 that or for everything about it and that the mainstream media just fell all over themselves
01:41:29 to cover him. And he got billions and billions of dollars worth in free advertising.
01:41:32 He gets tons and tons of advertising because he is popular content. He will always show up on TV
01:41:38 and he knows how to be popular content. So, and there was that, have you seen the
01:41:44 Emplemen video about Trump, about how he memed this way into presidency? You should definitely
01:41:48 check it out. It's a great video. It just basically goes through Trump's whole history and how he has
01:41:53 always basically propagated himself as a human meme to get into, you know, eventually into the
01:41:59 presidency. But like, I think that the way that Trump looks at the world, he just says like,
01:42:07 I know that this will work. I'm not going to listen to anybody telling me otherwise because I already
01:42:13 see how this will work. And that tends to be the way that I look at things, which is like,
01:42:19 all right, I know that like, for instance, getting into the industry as a writer, you know, like,
01:42:23 all of us knew at some point in the past, oh, we could try to get published traditionally. Like,
01:42:28 we could try to work for a company, get some kind of pro gig. But like, we saw that there was this
01:42:34 alternative path of YouTube. And we went, okay, like, it seems like this is a way you can do it.
01:42:40 So let's figure out like how we can experiment with this and find another way forward. And like,
01:42:44 when we think about politics, I think people tend to think about it inside the box of what we
01:42:49 expect to be the way things work. Instead of going, how do we rebuild this box? Like,
01:42:54 how do we reshape this? Where can we start? What moves can we make? And there are certain things
01:42:59 like the reason I hammer on about the alternative vote so much is not that I think it would like
01:43:05 magically change the system or anything. It's just that it's such an obvious step in the right
01:43:11 direction that would have so much power. And it's so easy to do. Because all we have to do
01:43:17 is demand it as a people. Like, if everyone in America decided, hey, alternative vote is a
01:43:23 better way than first pass the post because it means third parties have a chance of existing,
01:43:28 then like, that's all it takes to change that. And I look at it and I just think this is so
01:43:34 obviously a good solution, even if it does nothing in the long run, it would be worth
01:43:39 having changed it because it's better as a system. Why aren't we doing it? Why aren't we
01:43:45 doing it? Why aren't we making a big fuss about it? And it's because nobody thinks it can happen.
01:43:52 Like, people don't convince themselves that those kind of changes can happen because they just think,
01:43:56 well, how do you even change something like that? Well, you just ask. You just tell the government
01:44:01 to do it. You are the government, ultimately. So it's like everybody gets so caught up in
01:44:07 participating in the political game instead of thinking outside of it. And like, obviously
01:44:12 Bloomberg is thinking outside of it, but the way he's doing it is so cynical and so
01:44:17 transparent that everybody who looks at it goes, oh, well, this is like gross, you know.
01:44:21 Guys, can I get in for a second here? Because, okay, this whole discussion has been very interesting
01:44:25 to listen to. But every single thing all of you guys have said so far doesn't vibe with me because
01:44:31 it is all inherently, and I know these words have tons of meanings and, you know, whatever,
01:44:37 to me, everything you're saying, including you did, seems super left-wing. And by that I mean,
01:44:42 you guys are all talking about what the government should be doing. Whereas, as you were saying,
01:44:47 Ben, what does it mean to be left versus right? I definitely just approached this whole conversation
01:44:52 from a different perspective because I have the one fundamental belief I have that people
01:44:57 just basically do everything better than the government, and we should not expect them to
01:45:02 solve our problems because they're just shitty at it and worse.
01:45:05 Wait, nothing I was saying was implying that the government should do anything.
01:45:08 Everything you were saying is about how we need to change the system politically. Now,
01:45:11 maybe you're saying by destroying the government or minimizing it, is that what you meant?
01:45:15 I'm an anarchist. I'm all for destroying the government.
01:45:17 Oh, okay, okay, fair enough.
01:45:18 Let everybody do what they want. I would say that my...
01:45:20 Kind of not exactly how I would define anarchism, but...
01:45:24 Well, what I think would be ideal would be to just have,
01:45:30 you know, we don't need a government. We just need everybody to not fuck with each other, you
01:45:39 know? I mean, I agree, but how do you enforce that? That's the question.
01:45:41 Let me throw this at you and see if it sticks. All right. Now, I agree that it is bad for the
01:45:50 government to control people. I agree that if the government is stepping in and telling you
01:45:55 what to do and they are a force, if they are a totalitarian force that is in control of everything,
01:46:01 that is bad. However, my issue is that power can accrete anywhere, and it is theoretically possible
01:46:12 that individuals, such as like a private ownership of a business, Amazon, for example,
01:46:18 or any other big corporation, or corporations in general, they have the potential to accrue
01:46:26 power, and that is basically becomes oppressive just like a government does.
01:46:30 So, while I agree that it's bad for the government to be too powerful, I think it is totally possible,
01:46:36 and I would say that it is probably happening now, that private corporations and individuals are
01:46:43 becoming authoritarian in their own, right, and exerting undue influence over the public.
01:46:47 And the only way to fight back at them, I think, would be through government regulation,
01:46:54 because if private industry, private interests are all aligned with each other against the public,
01:47:00 then what instrument does the public have to fight? I mean, strikes?
01:47:05 Ideally, not buying things from bad companies would help.
01:47:11 I understand that. I understand that, but like...
01:47:14 It's hard. It's very difficult.
01:47:15 People use our goods.
01:47:16 I mean, the reason we have government is...
01:47:17 When you vote with your wallets, when you vote with your wallet, people with bigger wallets get
01:47:22 more votes. And the people with big wallets all have class solidarity with each other.
01:47:27 All the rich are ideologically aligned with each other against everyone else.
01:47:31 I mean, the biggest threat, I think, to the ability to not have a government is the lack of
01:47:36 education, the lack of the ease with which those who have power can control the upbringing and
01:47:43 the knowledge that is had by those who are, you know, grow up in the system.
01:47:48 They can control how we think about the world, what power we think we have.
01:47:53 They teach us to be docile and to follow the script and follow society by their rules,
01:48:00 so that they can keep it organized.
01:48:02 And I think that whether you find comfort in that or not depends on, A,
01:48:07 how happy are you in this system, which the average person obviously is, and to at least
01:48:13 enough of an extent that they participate. And also, like, how brave are you? Because
01:48:21 those of us who don't like the system, we don't like it because of the limitations it puts on us
01:48:27 in what we can do with our lives. And there's a lot of people who would probably say,
01:48:32 I don't want to be able to do those things. I would happily forego my ability to do these
01:48:37 things in order to be safer, to have the government have more control over my life,
01:48:42 because I trust them, they are better at keeping me safe than I am. And for me,
01:48:47 I don't feel that way, because the government makes the lifestyle that I want to lead
01:48:53 put me in danger. A lifestyle that would not be dangerous if not for the fact that it's illegal.
01:49:00 Like smoking, buying drugs or something. Like buying drugs, like A-Cab.
01:49:04 Yeah, just, I mean, that's the perfect example just on its own. I can't legally,
01:49:09 can't buy weed here. There's no harm in me smoking it and consuming it and buying it because it's,
01:49:16 I mean, it's legal in tons of places, but they make me a criminal. They make my actions dangerous.
01:49:21 Look, even somebody like me, despite what I've said before, I am absolutely prepared to discuss,
01:49:26 I do not believe in no government, I am not an anarchist. I am in favor of a small force that
01:49:31 just like, the society doesn't completely collapse and fall in on itself. And potentially,
01:49:37 just as an example, maybe if we legalized heroin or some magic super drug of fantasy,
01:49:43 like maybe that would cause all of society to collapse because everyone just does that.
01:49:46 That's what Pete wants to do. He wants to legalize all drugs.
01:49:49 I mean, I am not convinced that such a thing exists, but like if we knew that would happen,
01:49:53 I would be for the government preventing that happening personally, because I don't want
01:49:57 society to collapse. That is a net bad, I would say. So for things like that, like I'm totally
01:50:03 on board, but like there's other things, like the whole idea of businesses being overly powerful
01:50:07 and stuff, that's probably true in many ways, and we should fix those things. But I mean,
01:50:12 there are definitely fundamental disagreements. I know we've previously discussed about just the
01:50:16 existence of billionaires, and I guess giant corporations as well, being inherently immoral,
01:50:22 whereas I just don't agree that just the, I need tangible examples of what they're doing to police
01:50:29 and could someone go to the point? Could someone reach the point where like this
01:50:33 company has done so many bad things, it needs to cease existing, because I also believe that with
01:50:38 criminals, I'm for execution if they do enough bad stuff. Same thing with businesses. If they do
01:50:42 enough bad stuff, break it down. But until that, like Amazon has Amazon, for example,
01:50:47 to so much bad, we should destroy it. I would argue that their profits alone constitute a,
01:50:54 what should be a crime. Maybe. I think. I would need to see some data. It's not so much like
01:51:01 having a lot of money literally makes you do evil things. It's the whole system of capitalism
01:51:07 that encourages a, you know, it leads to certain outcomes when, you know. Are you talking about
01:51:15 like unrestrained rampant capitalism with no caps? Yeah, like, I mean, the whole thing with
01:51:21 fossil fuels being, you know, like climate change, there's no incentive for them to stop
01:51:27 getting that cheap, easy fuel from, from under the sea and all that. They're still going to use oil
01:51:33 because it's good for money. And like, there's not really an incentive to heal sick people if they
01:51:41 aren't, you know, they don't get a lot of money back. There's way more money in like an ongoing
01:51:48 treatment as opposed to a cure, for example. So that could be bad incentives. Do you know about
01:51:51 what's going on right now in Canada with the Wutsueten? I think I might be saying it wrong,
01:51:56 the Wutsueten, like, tribe of native people. Okay, well, there is a, there was a little,
01:52:03 it is a, it is an independent territory. It has never ceded control to Canada. Canada does not
01:52:09 rule it, but some fucking oil company wants to put a like toxic oil pipeline directly through
01:52:16 their territory to make money. They do not have the right to do this legally. And yet, and yet,
01:52:22 like the Wutsueten people like made like truck blockades to like block the company, because
01:52:28 the company just wanted to try to do it anyway. The people there like fought back, they set up
01:52:32 blockades to like prevent them from doing it. And Canada responded, they sent the Royal Canadian
01:52:37 Mountain, the Royal Mounted Canadian Police or the RMCP or whatever, they sent the cops in to
01:52:43 like fucking use lethal force to just fucking genocide these people, just like kick their
01:52:48 fucking asses and be like, no, it doesn't matter that we like, we're just, we're just gonna, no,
01:52:53 they can just do it now. I know you're, they're not allowed to, but we want them to. So they're,
01:52:58 they're just, they're just gonna do it. Is there more to this story than just being,
01:53:02 well, there's been a, well, there's been a huge backlash against it, like on the internet.
01:53:05 Was this recent? Was this a recent thing? Yeah, this was like last week.
01:53:09 Okay. Okay. Well, look, based on the facts provided, look, I agree, I would not, I would
01:53:14 like oppose that with whatever levers of power I have, because that sounds bad as described.
01:53:19 So, I mean, I'm with you, I'm with you. I mean, this is a particularly bold and barefaced example
01:53:27 of like the ruling class and the government and the, the, the, you know, big corporations,
01:53:34 the interests of capital, just like, just like, just nakedly fucking over people.
01:53:40 I haven't talked about, I'm still utilitarian and I, so I don't think I'm not an anarcho capitalist
01:53:45 despite the memes. I don't think people just do anything. There has to be some checks, but I'm,
01:53:50 I'm not a scholar. I don't know the specifics. And you know what, I've got a confession to make
01:53:54 for these stuff, you know, all the stuff that we've been talking about, I'll tell you,
01:53:58 I'm strongly considering voting for Trump. And I'll tell you why. It is, it is because
01:54:05 exactly as you said, Ben, when it comes to more government control of things versus less,
01:54:10 ideologically, I just know super clearly which side I'm on and which I would want to win the day
01:54:15 ultimately. I'm not for no government. I'm not for like bad things. I think we would agree on 95
01:54:21 percent of every single thing we want to have happen. I just don't think that on these, on these,
01:54:28 everything seems generally good in America, the localized place where things are right now.
01:54:34 And I don't know, like I just haven't been presented with a case that anything that other
01:54:39 people would do would make the world a better place, which is my main goal. So it's fine,
01:54:44 it's fine for the middle class probably, it's fine for the one percent. Yeah, the, yeah, the
01:54:50 shrinking middle class, the shrinking middle class is doing pretty, is doing reasonably well
01:54:56 for now. We could use, poor people could use healthcare, I think. Also, the minimum wage
01:55:05 should be higher because people work in these fucking like slave, slave wages, like Uber jobs,
01:55:12 gig economy. I just don't think that the government incentive system presented is a better
01:55:17 solution to make the world a better place overall. In the absence, in the absence of any like raising,
01:55:21 federal raising of the minimum wage, we've got like increasing, increasing wealth inequality,
01:55:27 and we've got fucking the GDP rising while like these standard of living drops.
01:55:34 Well, I just haven't been presented with solutions that make me think they'll make the
01:55:37 world better. But I'm just curious, Nate, why, like what have you heard from Trump that makes
01:55:44 you think he would be good to vote for? I will be completely honest, I don't follow politics
01:55:49 subjectly at all. Oh, here it is again. Here's this shit again. Look, like you said, Ben, we all
01:55:55 know our core ideology. I'm for a smaller government. I know which side that is. Why do you think Trump
01:55:59 is for small government? I don't think so. The guy just fucking completely overreaches his
01:56:05 presidential power. What are my options? Vote libertarian that'll lose? Trump is basically an
01:56:08 authoritarian. He'll just do whatever he wants. He doesn't care about this. Well, I mean, less,
01:56:13 some more than others. Anyway, I don't think Bernie's an authoritarian. Bernie's pro-labor.
01:56:17 Bernie is considered one of the more libertarian candidates. I feel like if you have not gone
01:56:24 into any depth to see what the policies are, you shouldn't vote. I agree. Well, I agree. I would
01:56:32 not cast a vote today because I don't have enough information. If you go into, if you research what
01:56:35 Trump is saying on whoever the Democratic Party is and you say, well, you know what, I do still
01:56:41 prefer Trump, then that's fine. But the fact that you don't even follow it in any way and you just
01:56:46 assume that Trump is your guy. For what it's worth, there's not much reason to even think about it
01:56:51 yet because as much fun as we all are getting hyped in these primaries, speaking for me personally,
01:56:57 I've literally never watched any primary debates or anything until this election,
01:57:03 and it's only because I'm with May who gives a fuck. I would not, I didn't even know about the
01:57:08 primaries until the last election. I did not know that was a thing that they didn't just select
01:57:13 their guy. I also was only vaguely aware of the process of the election before 2016.
01:57:17 All of this is just because Twitter now is politics Valhalla, which I'm fine with because
01:57:22 it's hilarious. Now that I follow nothing but what I'm going to call woke, but not what you're
01:57:28 thinking when you think woke accounts, it's been great. I follow Moon Cult and
01:57:36 guys like Michael Tracy. I don't actually follow him. He tweets too much. There are certain people
01:57:41 on Twitter who, not that I trust them as in I think everything they say is true, but I trust
01:57:47 them to be politics I want to follow, essentially. Everybody's got an agenda. Nobody's perfect.
01:57:53 What are we supposed to do? Look, I'm not going to count your vote.
01:57:56 Yeah, so just vote Trump. Simple.
01:57:58 Life's going pretty good. Yeah, seems fine.
01:58:00 Horrible. Absolutely nightmare. Let me say one last thing about,
01:58:05 I want to say one last thing. Hey, can you guys hear me?
01:58:08 Yes, now we can. Okay. One last thing about Bloomberg is that, oh, fuck, was it? Oh, yeah.
01:58:16 He's actually a giant balloon.
01:58:19 Bloomberg is a great dipstick, if you know what I mean, for liberals, right? Because a lot of
01:58:28 people really hate Trump. A lot of people can't stand Trump, but a lot of those same people
01:58:33 are fine with Bloomberg, even though he's just as much of an authoritarian,
01:58:36 just as much of a racist, misogynist, douchebag, just as much of a piece of shit as Trump is.
01:58:42 Well, it's not like ability voting because they don't have to see it. With Bloomberg,
01:58:46 Bloomberg acts presidential. He puts up a nice front. He's polite on Twitter, right?
01:58:53 Comparatively. And a lot of shit libs are like, oh, thank God, a return to normalcy.
01:58:58 They don't care about what he's actually going to do. They don't care about any
01:59:01 material consequences. They're just like, Trump is ugly. Trump is offensive.
01:59:06 I don't like seeing him. As long as I don't have to see him,
01:59:10 Bloomberg, if Bloomberg, I won't have to think about it as much because I won't hear as much
01:59:13 about it. Thank God. And it's a very sad state of affairs that we live in. And everyone that
01:59:18 supports Bloomberg should be put on a blacklist. And let me be clear. Anybody in the comments is
01:59:23 going to be like, oh, my God, Nate's going to vote Trump. Shut the fuck up. I'm not voting for
01:59:26 anyone. I'll tell you, if I had to vote today, I would blindly vote for the libertarian candidate.
01:59:30 That's what I would do today. Oh, you should vote for vermin supreme.
01:59:33 Well, who's that guy? I forget. He's the guy who wears the boot. He's the presidential guy.
01:59:39 Who wears the boot on his head. Let's get him up to 1% for the giant rat party.
01:59:44 I followed vermin supreme on Twitter the other day, but then I had to immediately
01:59:48 unfollow him because he tweets too much. He was retweeting something every five minutes.
01:59:53 Nothing worse than somebody you follow because they're cool, but then they just tweet too much
01:59:56 bullshit and they water it down. Yeah, it's the worst. All right, well, let's go to voicemails.
02:00:02 Let's fucking do it. I got them all right here. I test this beforehand. So hopefully they work
02:00:06 as they sometimes do and you ladies and gentlemen can leave your voicemail at the speak pipe link
02:00:12 down below. All right, what do we got first? Oh, I'm very excited for this one. This is my favorite
02:00:16 voicemail. How many? How many we got today? There's like five. There's like only five. Okay. So first
02:00:21 one is simply titled, fuck you, munchy. Is this better be about dads? Munchy, you're a real son
02:00:27 of a bitch. You know that? You know that you piece of fucking garbage used to be one of my favorite
02:00:32 members. But this last episode, every episode that you've been on recently has just been garbage.
02:00:38 Somebody says that you do that. You do that. You do what I just did. You're a son of a
02:00:45 bitch. You're a snake in the grass rat bastard. You'll never fucking hear this because you're
02:00:48 not going to be on the podcast. I'm all about the self improvement. We're like, I'm so fucking intelligent.
02:00:58 Damn. I wish Munchy were here to defend himself. If only he was here. But I guess this is, we'll
02:01:04 have to take his word for it. He's too busy stealing dads. It was like an actually scathing
02:01:10 criticism kind of, but it was embedded in such a funny sounding voicemail. I just, I just enjoyed it.
02:01:14 I hope he hears that and gets offended enough to come on next episode and respond. Me too. Me too.
02:01:21 We can only pray. All right, what do we got? Next one, we've got a professional podcast
02:01:27 procrastinator. Okay, take it away. I think this one was kind of quiet. So turn up your volume. All
02:01:32 right, go. So I'm about 10 episodes beyond the procrastiners podcast. Just finished watching
02:01:38 Pokemon Sucks. Now, if I were to watch the rest of the PCP episodes right now, how much of that
02:01:44 spicy YouTube bread money would be going to our ripple overlords instead of you guys?
02:01:49 Mmm, all of it. That's it. Yeah, right now, all of it. So for people in this guy's position,
02:01:56 as of the recording of, of, yeah, it's still in the hands of Brad Garlinghouse. We don't
02:02:01 have it back yet. Hopefully this will, this statement this week, hopefully this statement
02:02:06 will be incorrect. And when you hear it, we can only hope if this episode or whatever, if you're
02:02:13 listening to a new episode past like 195 on the PCP, then you're good. If not, I mean, it's fine.
02:02:21 That person will get the ad revenue on their channel, I guess, which is also fine. Okay,
02:02:25 that's it. So there you go. Don't watch other stuff on a channel until it's back. Fuck them.
02:02:29 All right. Next one, we've got, oh, I think this is a longer title, but I just called it proof.
02:02:35 It's proof of something, but I can't remember what. Let's find out. Go.
02:02:40 Hello, PCP. I hope you know I have your grapefruit held hostage. And if you ever want to see it again,
02:02:49 unharmed and unsweetened, then you will deliver 1000 pounds of bread and 1000 pounds of garlic
02:03:00 to the Washington Monument three hours after listening to this. Your beloved grapefruit won't
02:03:06 be unsweetened for long. Click the link. There's a link I posted in the gross disgusting audio
02:03:14 links to a DeviantArt image that this man uploaded. It's cute. Quandary poser, I guess. Oh, at least
02:03:22 he's using zero calorie sweetener. Oh, thank God. Thank God. That's good to say. So he's got a spoon
02:03:28 up to a grape, or he's going to eat it with a spoon with sweetener. Oh, God. I noticed that his first
02:03:32 thing says 1000 loaves of bread, which is different from pounds. That's probably less. We should
02:03:39 probably play it safe and go for pounds, because I'm pretty sure a loaf of bread is less than a
02:03:43 pound. Also, the plural is loaves with V. That's true. That's true. How is he expecting to feed
02:03:51 that grapefruit the sweetener when he taped his mouth shut? I think he's going to have to cut it
02:03:57 open. He's going to have to surgery. Is he going to joker the grapefruit? He's going to be bifurcated,
02:04:05 yeah. Well, we'll see what happens. Good luck to us. Poor disenfranchised grapefruit.
02:04:11 He never had a chance. I really like his face. Let me see. Yeah, there's actually pretty good
02:04:16 art on there. This is not bad. All right. We've got a completely unfunny voicemail from a concerned
02:04:22 citizen. Let's see what he has to say. What else is new? Hey, PCP, it's me. One of your brainless
02:04:29 fucking fans. I just wanted to call and ask you about the Radcon 4 fan meetup thing that you guys
02:04:36 were talking about two weeks ago. You're going to set a date for that, because if I'm going to buy
02:04:41 a plane ticket to go halfway across the continent to go fucking look at you and then murder you.
02:04:48 If I'm going to do that, I kind of need to buy a plane ticket in advance, and it gets
02:04:54 more expensive, the closer to the date you are. Could I know when that happens? That's a great
02:05:01 point. That's a great question. First of all, the Radcon, we will be at the place
02:05:08 doing Radcon stuff from the 6th to the 16th. It's in that window. So if you buy a plane ticket
02:05:16 to be, where were we thinking we are? Somewhere on Virginia Beach? We're in that town. We should
02:05:23 probably do it on a Saturday somewhere in that stretch. We had a thing on a calendar that we
02:05:32 were thinking of a possible meet update near the end. Where did I put that? Yeah. Okay, because
02:05:38 let me see. March 6th to 16th. Okay, 16th is a Monday. Okay, so like Saturday and Sunday. So
02:05:44 Munch is leaving Sunday night. So maybe Saturday or Sunday at the end of the con. So at the end?
02:05:50 So like we have all our stuff done and we can just kind of, I don't know, hang out.
02:05:54 14th. Yeah, that makes more sense. Maybe should we commit to the 14th Saturday
02:06:01 sometime during that day? We could do it Sunday too. We could do it the next day. I think Saturday
02:06:07 is a better idea. And I think, yeah, I do think we could do it on this. There's two Saturdays,
02:06:12 the 7th and the 14th. What do you think? I just don't know. Yeah, I think we should do it on the
02:06:17 14th. Okay, yeah. Okay, there's four of us here. Digi is muted for some reason, but I'll assume he
02:06:24 agrees. Right, so the 14th, Saturday, March 14th. All right, we're committing. That'll be the day
02:06:32 when we have a meet up and we are gonna do one. We should make an announcement outside of this
02:06:36 episode so that it comes out. I will make an update on the Kickstarter confirming that and I'll let,
02:06:41 I don't know, Tom and Munchy know that we're gonna do that. I guess it's not as critical that we
02:06:44 pick a place as long as we know that it's gonna be in Virginia Beach, but we should. Okay, yeah,
02:06:49 we can commit to that Saturday, March 14th in the area of Virginia Beach somewhere on that day.
02:06:56 If you want to come and do your stuff that's on you, that's not for us. It's not our problem.
02:07:01 We'll keep you posted here and on Twitter. Yes, we will. It's at tpcrastinators.
02:07:09 About where exactly and when and what the times are. There you go. That'll be the day.
02:07:13 Okay, well, let's update the Kickstarter with that information too. So that's in stone somewhere,
02:07:19 but okay, we got one more voicemail and this one is from Boyan. Let's hear Boyan finale,
02:07:26 as I'm sure it's called. Go. Guys, for the special occasion of episode 200,
02:07:32 could you please consider returning written questions? Some of us really appreciate that.
02:07:38 And maybe, maybe, maybe question mark live questions.
02:07:45 Live question, like doing the PCP live.
02:07:49 Well, the PC, well, episode 200 is going to be the streamed live at Radcon, right?
02:07:55 Yeah, I don't think we 100% settled on that because we'd have to do the 200 and one and like
02:08:00 202 episodes first. Yeah, we said we were just going to skip 200. Okay, if you want, all right,
02:08:05 that's fine. Okay, that sounds funny. It sounds amusing to me. Okay, we will probably do, I think,
02:08:10 okay, let's do like live questions via super chat, which are... Yeah, yeah. That's what we did last
02:08:18 time, right? We're going to have streams going... I think he was thinking that we wouldn't do it
02:08:21 all the time anyway, so. Yeah, that's, it'll be basically like a live stream, but we'll love
02:08:26 probably Victor's camera set up like we did last time and do it. That was so strange. I remember
02:08:31 watching, then, the way he zooms in right on our faces, like, oh god, it's too close. It's too close.
02:08:37 He was very close. You could give him notes, if you like, to be less close. Good memes, though,
02:08:42 good memes from that. So, okay, since we're doing things like out of order that way and we'll do
02:08:47 200 at Radcon, yes, you will in fact get a chance to say things to us. Although, I guess on the
02:08:53 larger point, I mean, as for bringing back written questions on like Twitter and stuff,
02:08:57 I don't know, bro. I'm not really feeling it. It seems like a lot of work and I don't care.
02:09:02 Well, it's not a lot of work. It's just, I don't care.
02:09:05 Yeah, I'd have to go somewhere else. Twitter questions are sweet about it.
02:09:08 In fact, it's because it's less work that the quality of the questions is usually so much worse.
02:09:13 Yes, that's why I was going to say the skill floor for asking a speak pipe question is higher,
02:09:17 and I think it self-selects for quality to a certain extent.
02:09:21 And I'm just reading minds here, but I don't know if this guy's maybe thinking that because he's
02:09:24 got a thick accent or it makes it harder to like, I mean, I'm sure whoever you are, you could make
02:09:29 a good voicemail with whatever good question. If you really, really needed to, you could do
02:09:33 like a text-to-speech robot voice to say the thing. Maybe he just doesn't want to put in the work,
02:09:40 which I guess. Look, guys, this guy can clearly speak English. I don't think that's the issue.
02:09:45 He was wondering. I don't know what he meant there. I mean, if there are any other people who
02:09:49 have struggling with English or like have a thick accent and they feel like they wouldn't get
02:09:52 understood, they can use a robot. Some people I think legitimately have that concern, I think,
02:09:56 when I call in. I don't know. But we're doing what we're doing. Use text-to-speech. I mean,
02:10:03 you can figure it out. Just be creative here. That's it. That's our last voicemail for the day.
02:10:07 So again, if you want to leave one, that is the speak pipe link down below. Click on that,
02:10:12 and leave us a voicemail. There you go. Let me see. We got a bonus episode coming up soon.
02:10:18 It'll be the bonus episode before Radcon, just like a couple of days before, and that'll be
02:10:24 on the 1st of March, and you can get that by pledging $5 to the Kickstarter at
02:10:29 what is it? Patreon.com slash TheProCrastinators, $5 bonus episodes, $1. You're in the bonus lounge,
02:10:36 or the normal talky discord lounge with all of us hanging out good times, and pledge as much as
02:10:42 you want. Do $1,000. Why not? I beseech you. Oh, and you know what? It'll be
02:10:47 funny to see. There will be a PCB episode that comes out at 2pm normally, and we get into our
02:10:54 Airbnb at Radcon 4 at 4pm, so that episode will probably just be rapping as we get to the house,
02:11:01 and we'll probably set up a live stream real fast. So on that day, on March 6th, you'll see
02:11:06 a bunch of stuff coming that evening, I'm sure. And also, follow us again for more info and updates
02:11:11 at TPCrastinators on Twitter. Updates about more stuff about the live meetup probably. Maybe we'll
02:11:17 iron that out fully on the Kickstarter. If not, TPCrastinators, follow us there for more info,
02:11:21 and yeah, I guess that's about it. Anything else? And we'll let you know on there when we get the
02:11:26 channel back as well. Go check out The Lord of Ghosts, Chapter 3 out on you. Yes, I have not read
02:11:33 it yet. I'm very excited to check it, to scope it, to peep it, to scopio-peepio it. Yeah. Go read
02:11:40 Chapters 1 through 4 of The Road to Radcon 4, Chapter 5 coming soon. That's right, Chapter 5
02:11:46 will be out very soon. Pledge to my Patreon to get early access to the pre-finale Slime and
02:11:51 Punishment updates coming out now. Patreon.com slash Ben Saints. Don't wear it out. And my channel
02:11:59 will have videos again soon. If we don't get this channel, if we don't get the PCP back,
02:12:06 I assume we'll stream the Radcon countdown to the end of the Kickstarter on your channel.
02:12:16 Maybe. We could do it on Twitch or something. I don't really want to do it on my main channel.
02:12:22 I guess we could. I don't know. Because it's closer to the Radcon
02:12:25 like viewer base, I guess. That's true. People would know the PCP would know your channel more
02:12:33 than they would know your Twitch, I think. Yeah. I mean, definitely true. Plus, there'd be way
02:12:38 more viewers just being on that platform. I would be in favor of that if you'd be okay with it.
02:12:44 Okay. We'll tell you what. I'm not super opposed. We'll iron that out and we will let people know
02:12:48 where it's going to be. Yeah. Okay. We'll decide that stuff. Well, it will have already happened.
02:12:53 Oh, yeah. Right. Oh, yeah. That's totally inside baseball right now.
02:12:57 Lol. You will have seen it. And oh, won't that be exciting for you?
02:13:01 All right. Anyway, we're out of here. Thanks for funding Kickstarters.
02:13:05 Road to Radcon 4. Radcon 4 Paradise, everybody. We're going to make all that good shit.
02:13:09 It's going to be good. You're going to enjoy it. I promise you.
02:13:12 Thank you, everybody, for supporting. $20,349 right now. My God. It just keeps going.
02:13:22 It just keeps happening. Well, thanks, everybody. And hopefully we hit that 2-2-2 goal.
02:13:25 Radcon 4 is going to be sick as fuck. Yes, the 2-2-2 goal. Will we have hit it by now?
02:13:29 I am optimistic, but we'll see. As am I. All right. We'll see you next week, everybody. Bye.
02:13:37 Losers.
