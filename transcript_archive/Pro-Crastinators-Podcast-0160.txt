00:00:00 Hello, everybody, and welcome to another clusterfuck of an episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:06 I am your host today, Tom Oliver, and we got a host of degenerates with us to talk about whatever the fuck comes up from our brain matters.
00:00:15 We got Digibro.
00:00:18 I'm alive for you. I'm awake because of you.
00:00:26 I'm flattered. We got Mage.
00:00:28 Pizza Hut, Pizza Hut, Kentucky Pie Chicken, Pizza Hut, Pizza Hut, Pizza Hut, Kentucky Pie Chicken, Pizza Hut McDonald's, McDonald's, Big Donald's, Big McDonald's, Pizza Hut McDonald's.
00:00:41 We're on endless war for the bit there, and then a deviated drastically.
00:00:45 I just always.
00:00:46 To get us back on track, we have Munchy with tiny hats.
00:00:48 Whoa, heaven let your light shine down.
00:00:57 We have Nate.
00:00:59 I'm at the Pizza Hut. I'm at the Taco Bell. I'm at the combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. That's me.
00:01:06 My favorite.
00:01:09 And of course, the one, the only, the yang-gang himself, Ben Zayn.
00:01:16 We've got the American Jesus. See him on the interstate.
00:01:21 We've got the American Jesus. He'll ever whelming millions every day. You guys like bad religion?
00:01:28 Ben, Ben, how's it feel to be on the cutting edge of political thought, Ben? How's it feel to be on the fucking, on the forefront?
00:01:38 It's exhilarating, Munchie. Exhilarating.
00:01:41 Titillating. Listen, you just, you just, you know, you know, blind yourself for the aesthetic, you know,
00:01:47 if the Mac parallels, walk up to a nearby cliff edge and just spout your fucking drivel for all the
00:01:52 pros to waddle up in here every single day. And soon enough, you're gonna be more powerful than the president.
00:01:58 Here's the thing. Thing about bad religion, I realize, is it's basically Linkin Park in the sense that it is like purely,
00:02:05 it is pure, it trades on pure emotionality over any like, like real, only, only the villain,
00:02:13 only the villain that is being railed against is just like, you know, society, bad politicians, you know,
00:02:21 evil, general evils of society, capitalism and all that, you know, rich people, instead of with Linkin Park, it's just teen angst,
00:02:32 just general angst. So once you hit your 20s, you just switch over? I like that better. Ben, you're so fucking killer, poor dude.
00:02:39 You just love being a teen. You love hating your parents. You love rebelling against the system. You're the most like killer core
00:02:47 person on earth. Why would I, why would you ever stop? Why would you ever want to grow out of it? Every, every single, like,
00:02:54 you know what, every single thought you have, I think that's an interesting thought. Then I, then I weave it back into the
00:02:59 overall Benson narrative. And I think, oh, this is actually like, you know, extremely in character. There's no
00:03:04 deviation. It sounds like every step that Ben takes is another mistake to you.
00:03:11 Ben, when we were young, we listened to Bad Religion, Alien, Ant Farm, obviously you led because you were the older
00:03:17 one. My friend, you remember my friend, Stefan. There are people who listen to Alien, Ant Farm. Absolutely. Well, let me
00:03:23 tell you about it. Pretty much just that one single. Any, are you okay? Right? Yeah, you're okay. You're okay. Now,
00:03:30 Ben, do you remember?
00:03:31 Well, whatever. It's good. It's a good cover. I think they're both good in different ways. But Ben, remember when we were
00:03:37 young? My friend, Stefan, made me, he burned me a CD of a bunch of Bad Religion music and like a couple other
00:03:44 things, including that Alien, Ant Farm cover. Yep. Just to introduce me to his favorite band and I listened to it over
00:03:50 and over and over again. Ben, I remember there was a time, I briefly, that played on the air and I remember you
00:03:56 said, uh, that's my favorite band. That's my favorite band right there. What, Alien, Ant Farm? Yeah. Yeah, that was a brief
00:04:03 period. Yeah, dude, absolutely. Alien, Ant Farm was never my favorite band. And I remember, okay, this is why I
00:04:08 think that, because I remember a brief episode where I said, hey, Ben, I've got, I've got a surprise for you. I've got a
00:04:14 secret to tell you, Ben. No, no. And it's that, guess what my favorite band also is? Your unrelated reasons. It's Alien, Ant
00:04:22 Farm, dude. And the rage, Ben, the rage at the fact that I would dare insist that your favorite band was also my
00:04:30 favorite band, you know, was enough to shatter galaxies. It exploded. I, I don't, the blows rained down on me from
00:04:38 all. I believe both of you. I believe that that wasn't Ben's favorite band and that he was that mad anyway.
00:04:45 I think it should be that mad at anyone whose favorite band is Alien, Ant Farm.
00:04:51 Yeah. All right, that's fair. Okay. All right. Yeah, good times. But then I grew up in and the cure became my favorite
00:04:56 band. Yeah. Okay. Really? Yeah. What an amazing musical history you guys have. Mine was disturbed for a very long
00:05:04 while. Oh, that's really, that makes a total sense to me weirdly. Just like, because all their songs are, they have the
00:05:13 same kind of underlying aesthetic as the kind of stuff you like that like, I'm going to explode and murder everyone around
00:05:20 me. No, no, mommy, don't do it again. Don't do it again. I'll be a good boy. I'll be a good boy. You know, early musical
00:05:29 taste is very incredible. So I mean, it seems totally natural that just when you're young, whatever music is around
00:05:36 will like the first shit you hear will just be your favorite. I remember the first time I realized music was
00:05:41 good was listening to the cure on someone CD at Boy Scout Camp. And I was like, entranced. I was like, whoa, is that music? I don't
00:05:50 fucking get it. But now I do get it. This is like good.
00:05:54 The reason why is because this was before Lime Wire, like back when you first got it. So you weren't spoiled for choice yet.
00:06:00 You couldn't just go on Lime Wire and find 10 billion songs. Like the world is at my fingertips. I mean, even today,
00:06:06 whatever the kid, like the first song he listens to and likes, he'll be like, well, that's my favorite song. Therefore, whatever's
00:06:11 popular will just be somebody's favorite.
00:06:14 I just remembered I think the reason why the reason why Stefan burned me that CD was because I brought it up to him because I
00:06:23 had heard some bad religion. So there was like one bad religion song on the soundtrack to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater
00:06:30 2. And I was like, I like that song. And I talked to him and he's like, oh, yeah, I know that band. I'll burn you some, some, some
00:06:36 tunes from that's nice. And I was like, cool. What a champ. Yeah, friends are cool. Shout out to Stefan. What a good guy. Shout out to
00:06:44 Stefan.
00:06:45 So is Stefan Molyneux?
00:06:47 Rest in peace.
00:06:51 Every day, I'm robbed of having this fucking teen musical experience, because I'm convinced that like, if you're above
00:07:00 30, you don't know what like headphones are. Because every single day, I have the same ritual. I go downstairs. I'm trying
00:07:09 to mind my own business. I'm just trying to get in and out of the kitchen as fast as possible before the mobs start
00:07:14 to spawn. But you know, it's like when you run into like a mob of spawning, you just try and raid the chest for all the
00:07:19 cookies and all the watermelon seeds. And then of course, the skeleton start to spawn in rows of three. I try and do that
00:07:25 but with scrambled eggs instead of cookies. So I sprint downstairs, usually trying to do this. Like I debate doing the
00:07:33 Super Mario 64 and long jump down the stairs and break all my bones. Every single day I get closer and closer to doing it.
00:07:40 And I'm going to die that way, I guarantee you. Anyway, I'm downstairs. And then I have my headphones in, you know, listening to
00:07:45 music, you know, thrashing about a little bit. And then every single day, every single moment when I have my headphones
00:07:52 in, people just try and talk to me. And it's like, guys, listen, I understand. I understand I'm your son, you want to speak
00:07:58 to me. Say to me, hey, let's speak now. And then I'll take off my headphones. Just stop. I'm always like this. Learn
00:08:08 my routine, learn how I am. Please, I beg you, I just want to be undisturbed. And then when I take them off, I'm not even
00:08:15 spoken to. Mom, I hate, I hate my parents. I'm gonna fucking, I'm gonna listen to bad romance to load up that CD
00:08:23 bin.
00:08:25 Would you like to see how it feels, mommy? Here it comes.
00:08:31 Have you guys heard of the band tattoo? TATU?
00:08:37 TATU.
00:08:37 My sister loved that band.
00:08:39 Two girls and two sisters?
00:08:40 I don't remember there.
00:08:42 No, it's too hot Russians who make out and shit.
00:08:45 Maybe they're also sisters.
00:08:47 That was the whole point was that they make out.
00:08:49 Yeah, I think I'm confusing them with another like sister duo.
00:08:53 I don't think they were sisters. But yeah, they had the whole lesbian thing on. Like, I really liked their music before they
00:08:59 started singing in English. And there was this one song I don't even remember what it was called. But I like my sister had
00:09:05 a CD and I just played like the first song on loop for hours. And then I remember her coming into my room all
00:09:11 angry. It's like, can't you stop listening to that same song? It's depressing as shit. And me, me not understanding Russian
00:09:17 was like, oh, okay.
00:09:18 Me, an intellectual.
00:09:22 Another band.
00:09:23 Me, an intellectual committing suicide.
00:09:26 Another band that really shaped my life. Like, I have only been to one concert. It was of this band, the band Lordy actually
00:09:33 listened to their songs yesterday and it was like, oh, the good old times. And I had a Lord Lordy. Yeah, I'm sending in the chat.
00:09:41 The image of Lordy is, are you familiar with guar?
00:09:44 They're, yeah, they're the ones that wear like the rubber.
00:09:48 I had the biggest question the lead singer.
00:09:51 Guar is the ones that wear like the rubber like monster costumes.
00:09:55 Yes. Yeah, Lordy also does that, except that they're the like the the Christian version.
00:10:02 That sounds incredibly killer.
00:10:05 Look at the second chat, the gross disgusting chat.
00:10:09 This is crazy.
00:10:10 That I had, I had a huge crush now.
00:10:12 Whoa, this is the sickest shit.
00:10:16 Dude, this is just steam steam powered giraffe.
00:10:19 Wait, wait, wait. Yeah, kind of.
00:10:21 By the way, which one did you like?
00:10:23 Which one did you like?
00:10:24 The lead singer.
00:10:26 The one in the middle.
00:10:27 Okay, like in the makeup around me.
00:10:31 And I don't know how he looks out of the makeup.
00:10:33 Yeah, yeah, oh my God, the face of the knee.
00:10:35 Oh my God, the severed face on his kneecap.
00:10:40 That's fucking sick.
00:10:41 Look at his belt buckle.
00:10:42 It's another face with a bit with a severed face.
00:10:46 You know, mage makes a lot more sense now.
00:10:48 I'm not going to lie.
00:10:49 Like this explains a lot.
00:10:51 Oh, look at the artistry on that, though.
00:10:52 You know, this is super sick.
00:10:54 It was a super sick.
00:10:56 It's pretty sick.
00:10:57 I'm all about it.
00:10:58 You know, this guy should be in Halloween too, mage.
00:11:01 Don't forget to include him.
00:11:03 I'm still waiting for it to come out.
00:11:05 The first the first bands that I got into,
00:11:07 my friend was burning me CDs with like
00:11:09 Demo Borgia and Children of Bodom and Shakespeare.
00:11:12 He was super into metal.
00:11:12 And that's how I got into it.
00:11:14 I was I was I was part of the goth click in my high school.
00:11:19 But I was like, I was just kind of a hanger on like I had,
00:11:23 you know, had like one pair of fucking hot topic trap pants.
00:11:26 You know, I had some I had black t-shirts.
00:11:28 I had long hair pants, Ben.
00:11:31 Trip pants, not TRIPP trip.
00:11:35 OK, yeah, trip, you know, yeah, with like the bondage rings
00:11:37 and all the zippers and shit.
00:11:39 I had one pair of of acid blue trip.
00:11:42 What? Oh, you got to go classic black.
00:11:47 No, man, I had the blue and black checkered pattern, you know,
00:11:50 and like they that's not what was great about them was that.
00:11:55 Well, no, they were more like punk, like a neo goth or something.
00:11:58 Whatever, they came from hot topic.
00:12:00 Who gives a shit? Right.
00:12:02 What was great about them is I wore them to every convention
00:12:05 because they had just these fucking insanely massive pockets.
00:12:09 And it was like having two mobile purses on your.
00:12:14 You could steal everything.
00:12:15 No one would know.
00:12:16 Yeah, well, like one time was my friend, Josh, used to wear
00:12:20 trip exclusively wore a pair of black trip pants.
00:12:23 And we went to see a movie one time and he had put like a whole
00:12:27 two liter of Mountain Dew in like a whole box of KFC in one pocket.
00:12:35 Dude, imagine like imagine the marshal potential there.
00:12:39 But you do like a spinning roundhouse kick and explode an entire
00:12:41 Mountain Dew container on someone's fucking face.
00:12:45 It was for acid damage.
00:12:46 You always have to carry all this bullshit, like all the extra schedules
00:12:49 and maps and shit. And so I would just have.
00:12:51 Yeah, I just I just I just want to paint a picture of my click.
00:12:54 So I was in this goth click, but I was more of a hanger on.
00:12:57 I didn't go to like concerts or anything there.
00:13:00 There were like two there were like two guys who were sort of the de facto
00:13:03 like top dogs and everyone else.
00:13:06 And like those guys like found bands.
00:13:08 Those guys went to concerts.
00:13:09 Those guys were hard.
00:13:10 They had like a ton of fucking like that.
00:13:12 I'm impressed that your fucking goth click actually like did things
00:13:16 because at my school, the goth click was just a bunch of stoners who did nothing.
00:13:19 Not all of them, but a few of them did.
00:13:22 And so their music, their musical tastes kind of trickled down.
00:13:27 Right. And Steph.
00:13:28 Stefan was in it, too.
00:13:29 My other friend who and he he had the pants.
00:13:31 He didn't go to like concerts, but he was he would he found me anyway.
00:13:34 They're their musical their musical discovery is all trickled down.
00:13:37 And so I was I was given like, yeah, children of Bodum and Cradle of Filth and stuff.
00:13:42 And I was like, yeah, well, I guess this is what I like now.
00:13:45 Dark time for music.
00:13:47 That was yeah.
00:13:51 Yeah, I think it was the worst show ever.
00:13:56 My they are the worst band ever.
00:13:58 One time my friends were over in my basement playing Dungeons and Dragons
00:14:03 or procrastinating and not playing Dungeons and Dragons just fucking around
00:14:07 shame instead of playing and someone put on a Cradle of Filth album
00:14:11 and our dad came down and I with with disdain in his voice.
00:14:16 He asked it was really funny.
00:14:17 He asked, like, oh, how did he say it?
00:14:20 It was like, hmm, so what are you listening to?
00:14:22 Songs about devil worship?
00:14:25 And I was like, yeah, I like sputtered with rage.
00:14:28 Don't fucking.
00:14:30 What? No.
00:14:31 Satan's misunderstood, dad.
00:14:33 You will never get it.
00:14:35 Basically. And he never and he never did.
00:14:37 Does have some songs about devil worship.
00:14:39 They absolutely do.
00:14:41 At one hundred percent.
00:14:43 It was wrong.
00:14:44 But he was uncool about it.
00:14:46 It's really funny because at that point in history,
00:14:48 my mom was way into black metal, specifically because it's about devil worship.
00:14:53 Our dad likes smooth jazz.
00:14:58 James Taylor, James.
00:14:59 Yeah, James Taylor, who I have.
00:15:00 I have come to appreciate some of the stuff that our dad liked.
00:15:05 Carolina on my mind.
00:15:06 Absolute banger.
00:15:08 Absolute banger of a song.
00:15:09 I've come I've come to love James Taylor.
00:15:11 I've come to love Genesis.
00:15:14 Yeah. And so that was all good.
00:15:16 However, he did have a habit of putting on like very, very dull,
00:15:21 like, on basically unlistnable, like smooth jazz, like medleys.
00:15:25 Well, that was just the anime study music of his generation.
00:15:30 He said it pretty much.
00:15:31 Chill beats to study too. Yeah.
00:15:33 It's true.
00:15:34 But I don't like it.
00:15:36 Me neither.
00:15:37 Hey, by the way, speaking of bad shows, I know this is a bit.
00:15:40 I think this is a bit of a cliche, but it's just that my buddy, John,
00:15:43 once went to a a Dragon Force concert and said it was like the dullest
00:15:47 piece of shit show I had ever been to.
00:15:50 I know exactly.
00:15:52 No, they're not slow, not because I've seen them twice.
00:15:56 And the first time it was early in the day because they were like the first
00:16:00 band at Oz Fest, and it was actually great.
00:16:02 They played all their songs accurately.
00:16:04 They had a couple of trampolines they're bouncing off of and shit.
00:16:07 It was cool as fuck.
00:16:08 So then they headlined a show and me and my brother Victor, because Victor is
00:16:12 a biggest fucking Dragon Force fan in the world at the time.
00:16:14 It was his favorite band is all he listened to.
00:16:16 We saw them live and they were all clearly fucked up.
00:16:20 Like, OK, OK, in different ways.
00:16:23 Like the singer was drunk.
00:16:25 The guitarist was on was seemed to be on Coke or something.
00:16:30 And then like one guy is like on speed.
00:16:31 Like they're all on different drugs.
00:16:33 And they sound like they're all on different drugs.
00:16:36 Like everybody's playing their parts wrong.
00:16:38 And so they sounded like shit to the fucking.
00:16:41 OK, the drummer just seemed like he was playing a blast beat nonstop
00:16:45 with no thought like he was just like, oh, this is what the drums are.
00:16:49 The guitarists were like playing the wrong parts at time.
00:16:52 And I swear to God, there was one part where one of the guitarists, Sam
00:16:56 Topman, was like playing the wrong solo.
00:17:00 And I think somebody was like trying to tell him.
00:17:02 And I saw him mouth to the guy.
00:17:04 They all sound the same.
00:17:06 In many ways, the guitarists said that.
00:17:13 Yes. And like the singer kept like throwing water onto the crowd and shit.
00:17:17 And he just seemed like pissed off for some reason.
00:17:20 Dude, they're getting too hot, getting fizzled.
00:17:22 Dude, it was a miserable show.
00:17:24 I literally deleted all their music off my computer after that show.
00:17:27 I was like, how old were you, how old were you like 18?
00:17:33 Yeah, OK, OK.
00:17:35 The illusion was shattered.
00:17:36 That's rough. I mean, I guess I guess touring will take a toll on you after a while.
00:17:40 I well, I've heard a lot of stories about the fact that they suck live.
00:17:44 And I think it's just because they do a lot of drugs.
00:17:47 Like definitely possible, because they like when when I saw them earlier
00:17:50 in the day, they were fine, because they hadn't started drinking yet.
00:17:53 And like at that that Ozfest, I met the two guitarists, because they were
00:17:57 just kind of wandering around, talking to random people.
00:18:00 And they were both of them are completely incomprehensible,
00:18:03 because I don't know if you know, but Dragon Force is a super group
00:18:06 and they're all from different countries and they all have no fucking idea.
00:18:09 All right. So they come over.
00:18:11 Is that Chinese guy who like actually Chinese?
00:18:13 Or is he? Yeah, he's actually Chinese and sick.
00:18:16 And the other guitarist is like just British and they're but they were both
00:18:20 sloshed because like we saw them somewhat after their show
00:18:23 and they were coming up to us, telling us how there is two Catholic girls
00:18:27 who they were trying to fuck because they were really hot.
00:18:29 But they're like they're both neither of them.
00:18:31 I think they're both virgins and they were like trying to pitch to us
00:18:34 this dilemma of like, should we fuck the hot girls we already have?
00:18:37 Who might not put out or should we go hunting for new hot girls?
00:18:42 But this came out like, yeah, well, we got this whole fucking bitches.
00:18:46 Like they're totally sloshed, incomprehensible.
00:18:48 Wait, wait, OK.
00:18:50 So he was describing to this to you a random fan asking for your advice
00:18:54 on which hot girls people it was me and Victor and my cousin, Boyd.
00:18:59 And like they had come to us after talking to another group of random people.
00:19:03 Like they were making fun of this.
00:19:04 Consensus, they were like an opinion.
00:19:07 They were yelling this out on stage or they were.
00:19:09 No, they're just walking around and this is like a huge festival as a Ozfest show.
00:19:13 So like there's, you know, food stalls and shit.
00:19:16 And they're just like walking around the stall area talking to random people.
00:19:19 And like there we came up to them because we had seen them talking
00:19:23 to these other two guys and they were making fun of this dude
00:19:26 because he was wearing this shirt for like a Christian hardcore band
00:19:29 that was at the show and POD.
00:19:32 No, POD is not a hardcore band.
00:19:34 God damn it.
00:19:35 Anyway, they were making fun of it because it had like a dinosaur on it.
00:19:39 And they were like, doesn't isn't dinosaurs evolution?
00:19:42 I can't have that on a Christian band.
00:19:45 And like, OK, it was funny.
00:19:47 Then and then after the last show, because the headliner I think was Slipknot,
00:19:51 after that show, we're leaving the pit and the two guys are just like kind of
00:19:55 standing at the entrance of the pit, like high-fiving people as they walk out.
00:20:00 And they said to us, we fucked those two girls.
00:20:03 They were awful. Yeah, all right.
00:20:06 OK, makes sense. Makes sense.
00:20:07 Virgins. It's terrible. No, that's great.
00:20:11 So, yeah, after that show, I was like, I wonder how the girls felt about it.
00:20:15 And we never we never got to hear their side.
00:20:17 I'm sure they were fucking terrible, too.
00:20:19 They're both shitfaced.
00:20:20 Like they probably whiskey dick out the fucking ass.
00:20:22 But yeah, it was like after that show, I was like, oh, Dragon Force
00:20:25 are so cool, we got to meet them and stuff.
00:20:26 That is the second time never listening to this band again.
00:20:30 Oh, yeah. Yeah. All right.
00:20:32 Well, that's a fascinating story.
00:20:33 Yeah, I can't believe that they were so forthcoming with with asking
00:20:38 just random people up.
00:20:39 But it's so cool that they were that they were just walking around
00:20:42 seemingly aimlessly begging for advice.
00:20:46 Who's going to criticize them?
00:20:47 Who's going to be like, too much information, Mr.
00:20:50 Dragon Force, man?
00:20:52 I mean, it was such a.
00:20:54 I wish he was fucking me instead.
00:20:56 It was legendary in particular
00:20:57 because it was the two guitarists who like, you know, they like stand back
00:21:00 to back and play guitars on stage and shit.
00:21:03 You just have the sense that like they've just become this power duo
00:21:06 who doesn't just hangs out and tries to fuck girls together.
00:21:11 I imagine they did it in front of each other, like going by the way
00:21:14 the story is playing out.
00:21:16 It had to be all in the same place.
00:21:20 Thank goodness.
00:21:22 I mean, or that reminds me of the time that I met X celebrity
00:21:27 at a grocery store in Los Angeles.
00:21:29 Tom Cruise, I told him how cool it was to meet him in person.
00:21:33 But I didn't want to be a douche
00:21:34 and bother him and ask for photos for anything.
00:21:36 He said, oh, like you're doing now.
00:21:38 I was taken aback.
00:21:39 And all I could say was, huh?
00:21:41 And he kept cutting me off, going, huh, huh, huh?
00:21:44 And closing his hands in front of my face.
00:21:47 I walked away and continued with my shopping and heard him chuckle as I walked off.
00:21:51 When I came to pay for my stuff up front,
00:21:53 I saw him try to walk out of the doors with like 15 milky ways in his ass.
00:21:56 Has anyone put a stop to this?
00:21:58 The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional.
00:22:01 And she was like, sir, we need to pay for those first.
00:22:03 But first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her,
00:22:06 but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
00:22:09 When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times,
00:22:12 he stopped her and told her to scan individually to prevent electrical interference.
00:22:17 He said and turned around and winked at me.
00:22:21 I didn't even think that's a word.
00:22:22 After he scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price,
00:22:25 he kept interrupting her.
00:22:27 He's laughing.
00:22:28 He's just laughing.
00:22:30 At a copy pasta.
00:22:31 I'm sure he's read a hundred times.
00:22:33 Oh, it's one of the best.
00:22:34 It's one of the best.
00:22:37 All right, that's it.
00:22:38 I'm done.
00:22:40 That's a great story, though.
00:22:41 Tom Cruise, sorry, we had a bad first meeting.
00:22:43 Was it Tom Cruise?
00:22:44 I thought it was.
00:22:46 Apparently, the origin is Flying Lotus, whoever that is.
00:22:49 I don't know who that is.
00:22:50 I've heard it with music, man, I think.
00:22:52 No, electronic musician, Flying Lotus.
00:22:54 He's a he just did a music video that was made by Shinichiro Watanabe.
00:22:59 Oh, sick.
00:22:59 Yeah.
00:23:00 And he's the guy who who I wrapped over in my Shintaro Kago video.
00:23:05 That was a flying lotus song because he had a cover.
00:23:09 Meeting celebs at fucking in a.k.a.
00:23:12 real celebs or fake celebs, E celebs is always a magical experience.
00:23:17 It's always the highlight of cons.
00:23:18 We see them, you know, outside of the smoke and mirrors game
00:23:23 at the console playing, just walking around, maybe being a hot dog
00:23:26 or a pretzel with cheese sauce, just walking around and you know
00:23:30 that you can engage them at any time.
00:23:31 Are you among them, doctor?
00:23:33 Well, who literally feel that way about you.
00:23:36 That's true.
00:23:37 That's true.
00:23:38 So then I would initially imagine actually and expo, not the legendary
00:23:46 expo, but last an expo was particularly weird because I was like stopped
00:23:51 more like vastly more so than one would think.
00:23:56 Like very often, like very often, like I think like seven times a day.
00:24:03 That's a lot.
00:24:04 I know for fucking little old me.
00:24:07 So it was extremely weird.
00:24:08 It was extremely weird to be in that scenario because from my perspective,
00:24:12 it's not as though like I'm I have like a panel or like, you know,
00:24:16 I'm an anime guru or man.
00:24:18 Your face isn't even online that much comparatively speaking.
00:24:22 Yeah, that's also another thing to think about that a lot of times people.
00:24:25 I don't know what people like imagine me as.
00:24:28 Maybe they imagine me as my curvy avatar or something like that.
00:24:30 I guess your image is pretty powerful, though.
00:24:32 Like people are aware of what you look like.
00:24:33 Yeah, what were you wearing?
00:24:34 Were you in like a pizza jumpsuit?
00:24:36 Because I was definitely I was I was in the pizza jumpsuit.
00:24:39 One of the days I was I was in the curvy shirt.
00:24:41 I was in my iconic wear.
00:24:42 So that's OK. Good.
00:24:44 I'm so happy people don't know how I look like.
00:24:48 Yeah, that's a plus.
00:24:49 I'm terrified of people stopping me in the middle of a street being high mage.
00:24:52 And I I I'm spooked.
00:24:56 Well, you got to try it.
00:24:57 Well, it's awesome with that.
00:24:58 No, I'm scared.
00:25:00 I got scared.
00:25:00 Well, how are they going to they're going to praise you?
00:25:03 Are you like, oh, I mean, the thing about it is
00:25:07 once you're in that position, you cannot go back.
00:25:09 So like, you know, I get being cautious about it.
00:25:12 And frankly, I mean, I don't know, I've been listening a little bit to like
00:25:15 with this like James Charles shit going on or whatever.
00:25:18 I don't know, just for whatever reason,
00:25:19 I've been looking back at like a couple of like fucking like PewDiePie.
00:25:22 Like what is it?
00:25:23 The controversy memes.
00:25:24 And there was one about, I don't know, like foosie tube or something.
00:25:27 Whatever point was like PewDiePie was just saying like, yeah,
00:25:29 I fucking hate being in public.
00:25:30 It's the worst.
00:25:31 And I'm like, make make sense.
00:25:33 Probably gets harassed like a lot every time he's in public.
00:25:35 So you would be getting stopped everywhere, I would imagine.
00:25:39 And I know he's like, obviously the far reach,
00:25:42 like the most convenient stuff.
00:25:43 I enjoy it at a convention because you're going there.
00:25:47 You're kind of there for that, yeah.
00:25:49 And like if it happens randomly every once in a while,
00:25:53 like at my level of fame, it's exciting because it's like, wow,
00:25:58 people in the place I live know who I am.
00:26:00 That's cool.
00:26:01 And it's only happened like three times.
00:26:04 Well, maybe like five times.
00:26:06 Like, but yeah, it's it's I've been most of it was in Rochester.
00:26:10 Weirdly, like I would get one guy recognized.
00:26:13 We had a grocery store at a theme park and at the mall.
00:26:16 Like I think those are the convention there, right?
00:26:19 Did they have an anime convention?
00:26:20 Yeah, and I did the convention.
00:26:21 And, you know, obviously people knew who I was at the con.
00:26:24 But like I had never been stopped anywhere in Virginia Beach before.
00:26:28 But in Rochester, it was like a few times.
00:26:31 And like it's always like, wow, I feel like a walking legend, you know,
00:26:35 but like, yeah, yeah, it would very easily cross a threshold.
00:26:39 If it was happening even once a week, I would get right.
00:26:42 Right.
00:26:43 So with PewDiePie, it's got to be daily.
00:26:44 And none of us have really gotten to that point or even close.
00:26:47 So I mean, yeah, and like when you like the things like I'm two of my own
00:26:52 own or anything, it wasn't a convention, which vastly increases the odds.
00:26:55 But even sure, of course, still though.
00:26:57 Yeah, I mean, yeah, I should like VidCon where people are straight up in danger
00:27:01 because crowds are swarming to such ridiculous degrees.
00:27:04 Videos of VidCon are fucking crazy, dude.
00:27:07 They're like literal like swarms of dude.
00:27:09 OK, because it's it's totally dystopian.
00:27:12 It's it's fucking crazy seeing like a crowd of people all with their phones out,
00:27:18 circled or like surrounding Casey Neistat, all like with video cameras
00:27:23 about their head to vlog seeing Casey Neistat in the exact same experience
00:27:28 that all of these other like hundreds of people are doing.
00:27:31 So this person's vlog, if you're vlogging that moment, you're just like a fucking
00:27:36 like a complete sheep.
00:27:39 You have no agency whatsoever.
00:27:41 Just it is fascinating exact same fucking thing.
00:27:44 Things like that, things like that really seem to me to like make me believe
00:27:51 not only that like human beings are complete like sheep, but it's specifically
00:27:54 that like, oh my God, like my fellow human beings would absolutely like
00:27:58 trample me and tear me apart for the sake of like some small gain of their own.
00:28:04 I mean, not to that degree, but I was just thinking about this like yesterday
00:28:09 and I want to talk about it, that yeah, it fascinates me.
00:28:14 The level people will go to to just like touch fame,
00:28:18 even though it's not hard to get and it's like more work.
00:28:23 It's really well, it's really interesting to me like how people think of it
00:28:26 because I've seen plenty of people in online circles who just kind of become
00:28:33 friends with a lot of famous people by just messaging them and like literally
00:28:38 mean literally like, yeah, like there's there's lots of people just because
00:28:42 they work at that person and they think, oh, that seems like a cool guy who I
00:28:47 bet I could have a fun conversation with.
00:28:50 And so they just approach you and, you know, do so well.
00:28:55 And then like your friends and then there's other people who like view you.
00:29:00 If you even have like, say, 10,000 subscribers on YouTube, they think you're
00:29:04 like untouchable, like I can't believe you would have time to risk.
00:29:08 Like I still today have times where I respond to somebody's comment on YouTube
00:29:12 and they might be like, oh my God, I can't believe Digi Bro responded to me.
00:29:16 And I'm like, dude, I hang out in like a discord server of people.
00:29:19 Like I'm fucking easy to reach like message me.
00:29:22 I just don't know.
00:29:22 It's I just don't know.
00:29:23 And it's really funny because like my mom is very much a fame chaser of this sort.
00:29:32 And like she loves going to concerts and she always tries to meet the band.
00:29:36 Like she has, she's a huge fan of the band System of a Down and she like has, you
00:29:41 know, pictures she's taken with the band members that she like treasures.
00:29:44 Like they are, you know, the most important things she has is like these
00:29:48 pictures are like momentary interactions that she'll remember forever.
00:29:52 And like I, I, I guess I understand that.
00:29:56 But for me, I've gotten into a position where like the people who I look up to
00:30:00 or admire, I can just hang out with because I'm famous.
00:30:04 Like I got to go to Dick Masterson's house because he's never even seen
00:30:09 any of my content.
00:30:10 I don't think like I just am somebody who happens to be your lecture moderate.
00:30:14 Oh, except for the lecture.
00:30:15 Yeah.
00:30:16 But like he had had me on his show even before then just because he knew that
00:30:19 I was a guy who had a lot of followers who happened to be at his live show.
00:30:23 So he brought me on the show to talk about it.
00:30:25 And it's like, that is the basis of our relationship is I'm a guy who has
00:30:29 followers who is a fan of his, you know, and it's just funny for me to think that
00:30:34 like there are people who call into that show who are like, oh man, I would,
00:30:38 I would do anything to be able to get a spot on the Dick show.
00:30:41 And it's like, I just kind of got it just because I am somewhat famous.
00:30:45 And like, I think anybody, I don't feel like it's hard to do.
00:30:50 I feel like it's pretty easy to just, you know, if you even open your mouth on the
00:30:56 internet about anything of interest and like 10 people follow you, you're already on the path.
00:31:02 Like you just got to keep doing that and you will get bigger.
00:31:06 We've certainly lowered the bar for entry massively.
00:31:10 Speaking of like, well, when you said about when you left a reply on a YouTube comment
00:31:17 and someone was like, oh, should did you bro replied?
00:31:20 They reminded me of like, one time I commented on some random video and someone was like,
00:31:24 oh, you're you, you're Lathalora major.
00:31:27 Wow. Fancy meeting you here.
00:31:29 And I'm like, yeah, I enjoy media online as well.
00:31:32 Fancy that.
00:31:33 But that also like gives me like a scary thought.
00:31:36 It was like, when you're famous, it's kind of hard to just leave random comments on videos
00:31:41 because people will just like take it as like some sort of mega statement that like you posted.
00:31:48 You're like, oh, hey, I like your music.
00:31:50 And suddenly a news article, did you bro, I liked this music.
00:31:55 He supports the artist.
00:31:57 We see people, yeah, make articles about that kind of shit with really high profile people.
00:32:02 So yeah.
00:32:02 I have been from the very beginning very careful about that.
00:32:07 Like I won't comment or like something unless unless I do completely stand by it because I expect that.
00:32:15 Yeah, you're forced to make those kind of at least weigh that as part of your decision.
00:32:20 And it sucks.
00:32:22 I mean, it's kind of life.
00:32:23 You say it sucks.
00:32:24 But all you have to do is make it all to count.
00:32:26 You know, like just, I mean, true, make a sock puppet that you can use to comment.
00:32:31 Tons of people do it.
00:32:33 It's interesting when you go to, if you go to a lot of like famous YouTube channels and stuff,
00:32:39 they often don't use that as their main one because like you'll go to say ego raptor and like
00:32:44 he has no subscriptions.
00:32:45 And it's like, well, you obviously subscribe to people on YouTube.
00:32:49 You must have another account, you know, I think that's pretty common.
00:32:53 True.
00:32:54 In fact, I've kind of been meaning to do that just for the sake of convenience.
00:32:57 So I just don't have to think about this so I can just be like, yeah,
00:33:00 whatever this is my fucking, in fact, I have several accounts that I use for like uploading,
00:33:04 like test uploads and shit like that.
00:33:06 I want to make one just for shitposting because I get, there's times where I watch videos and
00:33:11 I have something really mean to say and I'm like, if I say this as myself, people are going to be
00:33:15 like, what the fuck?
00:33:17 So I need to make a just shitposting account.
00:33:21 I guess I, I don't know, not to make it too serious or anything, but like I think about like,
00:33:25 if that's like kind of fucked up to like hide who I really am when I make a certain comment,
00:33:31 like the same exact thought crosses my mind all the time.
00:33:34 The thing is who you really are, like, I mean, as a content creator, you are,
00:33:40 you're only showing a little bit of yourself anyway, like who you really are is always veiled.
00:33:45 If anybody had a direct read into any of our minds, they would hear all kinds of, I mean,
00:33:52 I don't think there's anybody whose mind is sanitary who can like not think anything fucked
00:33:58 up or bad at all.
00:34:01 So like, you know, ultimately it's just about like, which thoughts do you decide to represent
00:34:07 as part of your character?
00:34:09 I think it's totally fair to represent other thoughts as part of a different character.
00:34:14 I got you.
00:34:15 And isn't that a fascinating thing?
00:34:16 I kind of feel like a lot of what the modern world is going to is the sort of the expectation
00:34:21 that everybody is clean all the time.
00:34:24 And I mean, it just goes in line with this like old post that we've made before posts mattered
00:34:29 and you could shit talking, nobody cared.
00:34:31 But now that's being, it's being recontextualized and changed.
00:34:35 And I mean, I get it.
00:34:36 I get it.
00:34:37 It's just, I think as we get more and more into each other's heads,
00:34:40 we're going to see more and more shit we don't like seeing.
00:34:42 And we need, I think the best thing we need is some sort of exhaust valve to be like,
00:34:46 okay, you know what?
00:34:47 I shouldn't care that this person said this fucked up thing at this time.
00:34:50 I should not care that much because we all say fucked up things and think to ourselves,
00:34:54 fucked up shit as long as it's not hurting anybody directly.
00:34:57 The sort of combining of two things where on one hand,
00:35:01 all of your interactions you have are like encased into marble and you cannot scrub them
00:35:06 clean no matter what you do.
00:35:07 You can delete a post.
00:35:08 It doesn't mean it's not going to be on the way back machine if it was a really
00:35:11 controversial post or anything like that.
00:35:13 So really, there's not anything you can do.
00:35:14 But also because of that, yeah, now people are really scared of posting things that
00:35:20 may be considered controversial or bad.
00:35:23 So then it can breed a situation where there's no bad posts on a particular profile because
00:35:30 they've made it to be that way intentionally.
00:35:33 So then it can have an air of perfection or pristineness that is not natural.
00:35:39 What the cultural shift I want to see the most is to not be so hard up on trying to not be wrong.
00:35:48 Like it feels like it's if you say something wrong these days,
00:35:53 people will jump down your throat about it.
00:35:56 And like, I don't think that being correct all the time is that interesting or necessary or like,
00:36:03 you know, makes you a better person because everything you say isn't wrong.
00:36:07 In a way, I think it's less about you being wrong and more people just wanting the gotcha
00:36:11 moment being correct on the internet, getting their limelight.
00:36:14 Yeah, very much so.
00:36:16 And it's kind of sad.
00:36:16 They want to be able to feel like they have something over you, which it's understandable
00:36:20 because it's it's sort of like justified bullying in a way.
00:36:26 It's like, yeah, the reason people bully is always that, you know, they someone has power
00:36:31 over them, they want to have power over someone else.
00:36:34 And like in a culture where we understand that bullying is wrong,
00:36:38 it's like, how can I bully you but be correct in doing so be justified.
00:36:43 And it's like, oh, you said something wrong.
00:36:45 I'm going to harangue you about it.
00:36:47 And it's like, yeah, but who gives a shit?
00:36:49 And the mental, the mental gymnastics some people go through just to twist your words
00:36:56 into being wrong so they can be right is scary.
00:37:01 This may be a provocative example, but like the whole projared thing going on recently,
00:37:06 I'm very much reminded of.
00:37:07 And at first, I mean, obviously a lot going on there.
00:37:11 But like the first thing that we all hear much going on there.
00:37:14 To the OK, the only thing I want to get into is specifically that like, OK,
00:37:17 at the point that we're at now.
00:37:19 So like, obviously, Jared was involved with some degree to other women.
00:37:22 I don't know what the timeline is.
00:37:24 But like the timeline is actually kind of important because it sounds like they were
00:37:28 going through like a period of breaking up since like February.
00:37:32 So like, I don't know exactly when these the whole underage thing again, like maybe.
00:37:36 OK, here's my point.
00:37:37 I'm going to bad things were said about Jared.
00:37:39 And I'm sure some of them are true.
00:37:41 But we really don't know exactly what is true and what he knew when.
00:37:45 And like if he did bad things exactly at this specific time and on the whole charge
00:37:49 of like cheating on his wife, all I'm saying is she says that he cheated.
00:37:52 His response is we actually had a more complicated open relationships,
00:37:57 which it seems to a degree is true.
00:37:59 So my only thing is, well, shit, this is complicated.
00:38:01 I don't know what to say.
00:38:03 Yeah, yeah, he did in his most recent.
00:38:05 The wife confirmed it as well.
00:38:06 She said eventually.
00:38:07 But that's the thing.
00:38:08 And it's just like it's such a clusterfuck.
00:38:11 And what?
00:38:12 The last update was he put out a message that said like and she responded to it.
00:38:17 But he said like, yeah, we like we had an open relationship and blah, blah, blah.
00:38:21 Things get out of hand.
00:38:22 Things went bad.
00:38:23 So what did so what did she what did she say to that?
00:38:26 Basically, she said like that's I think she agreed that it was somewhat true.
00:38:31 But like the thing with Heidi, for example, like went way beyond what they had agreed to.
00:38:35 Right. Yeah, that's what I meant.
00:38:37 Like that went like she specifically said, like, don't do this.
00:38:39 Okay. So like now in order for us to make a determination who's bad and who's good,
00:38:44 I need to know the timeline, the motivation of characters involved.
00:38:48 Like exactly.
00:38:49 And so my point is I cannot sort this out.
00:38:52 I can't do it.
00:38:52 No.
00:38:53 Nor should you have to for any reason at all.
00:38:56 Yeah.
00:38:56 Right.
00:38:56 That's what I'm getting to.
00:38:57 I absolutely hate things like this.
00:39:00 Because on the one hand, like for some some weird part of my brain is fascinated by
00:39:05 internet celebrity drama.
00:39:07 But at the same time, I'll be checking out of the grocery store and I'll see People Magazine
00:39:11 and I'll like puke in my mouth.
00:39:13 And this is the exact same thing.
00:39:14 It's just people magazine for E celebs on Twitter.
00:39:16 Yeah.
00:39:17 So I was I was deeply ashamed of myself for finding myself like totally like engaged in this.
00:39:24 And like, I'm a totally hypocrite.
00:39:26 Me too.
00:39:26 Discuss myself.
00:39:27 I'm so happy to announce that I have I have no idea what you're talking about.
00:39:31 And there's I'd like to make a public statement.
00:39:35 I have no idea what any of you are talking about.
00:39:37 You're a champion among us.
00:39:42 To me, there's like there's there's it's like with something like the pro-jaret situation.
00:39:46 It's so it's so like again, like you said, unclear and also it's just something that
00:39:53 like if I was a fan, this doesn't affect his content in any way.
00:39:58 Like if he actually did like have sex with an underage girl or like send
00:40:04 dick pics to underage girls, then that's it's that's bad.
00:40:08 I'm okay.
00:40:09 You know, the authorities might want to get involved with that.
00:40:15 You know, like whatever.
00:40:17 I mean, it's the stuff the stuff about the stuff about cheating on his wife.
00:40:21 That's, you know, maybe bad.
00:40:23 But I don't give a fuck if somebody cheats on their wife.
00:40:25 Like it's no one else's business at all.
00:40:29 The stuff.
00:40:29 Okay.
00:40:29 The stuff about the underage girl, I find the timing of when all that happened to be very
00:40:34 suspicious.
00:40:35 Like, isn't it strange that his wife outs him as a cheater?
00:40:39 Public opinion suddenly turns against him.
00:40:41 And then only at that moment, a handful of people come out and say,
00:40:44 oh yeah, he did all these other bad stuff too.
00:40:47 And he's fired for it.
00:40:48 We were investigating this whole time, but only now are we going to say anything about it.
00:40:51 Everybody acts like the people who come out and confess are such heroes.
00:40:54 But it's like if you've known for years and you haven't said anything, only now when it's
00:40:59 publicly safe to come out and like dog pile, like you're just as much of an asshole.
00:41:03 Like I have no respect for you.
00:41:05 Well, I mean, again, like maybe these people are true heroes who felt super scared by the
00:41:11 powerful pro-Jarrod.
00:41:12 And only now, I'm just saying, maybe that's true.
00:41:15 I don't fucking know.
00:41:16 I smell a little whiff of bullshit on that whole thing.
00:41:22 But at the end of the day, at the end of the day, like these allegations are criminal and
00:41:28 therefore should be decided in a court of law and not in the court of public.
00:41:31 Well, you know what people say.
00:41:32 I think it's weird for an like granted.
00:41:36 I don't think anybody gave a fuck about pro-Jarrod at the time this happened.
00:41:39 I think him bleeding all those subscribers was more like people having an excuse to
00:41:46 Like he hadn't uploaded a video in like four months, right?
00:41:49 And he hasn't been relevant in years.
00:41:51 His videos have very low view counts even among the ones that was due to like personal issues.
00:41:56 But I mean, that is true.
00:41:57 Whatever the case may be, people, I don't think like people act like
00:42:02 I'm so offended he cheated on his wife.
00:42:05 If he was making great content, people wouldn't care.
00:42:08 Like John Tron, when he got into his whole racist thing,
00:42:13 he had a huge backlash.
00:42:14 His whole subreddit turned against him.
00:42:16 He lost a bunch of subs, put out more videos that people liked and it completely blew over.
00:42:21 I mean, people will get over this because honestly, because this this issue,
00:42:25 like what's the substance?
00:42:26 I mean, I'll tell you what it is.
00:42:29 It's a whole lot of virtue signaling.
00:42:31 It sure is, buddy.
00:42:33 I don't like that Projara did this thing.
00:42:35 So I'm unsubscribing.
00:42:36 And I'm just like, what even is the virtue of this for a guy cheating on his wife?
00:42:42 I don't like cheating.
00:42:44 I would not do it, but I don't understand the moral.
00:42:50 It's like, it's just some social contract you have with the government.
00:42:53 Like it's not, you know, why are we judging somebody on the basis of like what their sex life is like?
00:43:00 I just don't get that.
00:43:01 I mean, yeah, people, people don't think about this,
00:43:04 but let's just paint the theoretical scenario about a man who's in a somewhat open marriage
00:43:10 with a wife who let's just say for the sake of possible example is horrible to him.
00:43:14 I'm not saying she was, but like, okay, maybe it would make sense why they drift apart.
00:43:19 And he is like with other women and as we've established some degree of open marriage.
00:43:23 Now that's just a hypothetical.
00:43:25 I have no idea how good or bad this man was.
00:43:27 But like, because that's possible, I just think that it makes sense to just like hold off and
00:43:32 let people with knowledge sort it out.
00:43:34 I have an interesting, I have a different perspective that I gained this past week because
00:43:39 I was saying this before the show started.
00:43:41 So I've been listening.
00:43:42 I have been while I've been working and doing other stuff.
00:43:44 I've been binge watching a ton of like the Penny Arcade D&D games,
00:43:51 specifically the C team with Amy Falcone and Chris Straub and some other guys.
00:44:00 But they did a crossover event with another group called Dice Camera Action,
00:44:06 I think, or AKA Waffles Incorporated.
00:44:09 And the thing that's relevant there is that two of the players in that game,
00:44:13 a long running game, are Pro Jared and Holly Conrad, which is very interesting.
00:44:20 That game is mostly played over Skype calls, over video chat,
00:44:24 but for this special crossover event, they all came and they sat in the room.
00:44:30 So this is what happened.
00:44:31 Is that what you're trying to say?
00:44:32 Maybe.
00:44:33 Oh, definitely.
00:44:34 I'm pretty sure that this is during when they were cheating,
00:44:39 or they were fucking each other at this time that this event was recorded.
00:44:43 And I don't know, it was just really weird with this new context.
00:44:48 I was watching them and the two of them are like,
00:44:52 they will make goofy faces at each other and they look at each other a bunch.
00:44:57 And funny enough, their whole character arc is like,
00:45:02 they're like star-crossed lovers that can't be together.
00:45:06 Yeah, straight up.
00:45:08 One of them is from a family that has packed with demons,
00:45:11 and the other is from one that have packed with angels.
00:45:13 And it's like, if they get together, the multiverse is destroyed.
00:45:16 So they make a deal with Asmodeus to change their fucking family.
00:45:20 And I'm like, oh my god, I can't fucking believe this.
00:45:22 Isn't it crazy?
00:45:22 That is fascinating.
00:45:23 It's fucking crazy.
00:45:24 I would like, I want there to be a psychological study
00:45:27 on how often do people's D&D campaigns just reflect their inner,
00:45:32 like what they want to be happening in real life, or how they see themselves.
00:45:37 I am 100, okay, I've been watching the C-Team.
00:45:39 I am 100% convinced that everyone's character is just what they want to be.
00:45:46 Yeah, fascinating.
00:45:46 I mean, mine was when I was playing Niga Rafiki and I had 500 bottles,
00:45:51 5,000 bottles of ale, and that was all I had.
00:45:53 Word.
00:45:56 Like, I don't know, Chris Straw plays this drow who is a complete introvert,
00:46:01 who doesn't understand social interaction and hates his physical body,
00:46:06 and is disgusted by his physical existence
00:46:10 and only wants to consider high-minded divinity and stuff.
00:46:14 And the dragonborn Donar Blitzen, he's this fucking high-falutin,
00:46:20 fucking narcissist Chad guy who's played by this shlubby guy who loves sports and wrestling.
00:46:28 The list goes on.
00:46:28 I'm convinced.
00:46:29 I'm absolutely convinced that everyone's D&D character is just what their inner self looks like.
00:46:35 That is fascinating perspective.
00:46:36 Whether they intend it or not.
00:46:39 By the way, on this issue, I just want to be super clear.
00:46:42 I hate cheaters, and more than anything, I hate liars.
00:46:46 People who lie regularly are absolutely scum to me.
00:46:49 But the issue is, yeah, exactly, I despise lying at every capacity.
00:46:54 It's just that I don't actually know what accusations are true or false,
00:46:58 so I can't identify who's the bad guy yet.
00:47:00 But when we do, look, we'll probably never know for sure by my standard.
00:47:04 Here's the thing.
00:47:05 So in addition to all that, I've been listening to some Slavoj Žižek.
00:47:09 And in particular, this started with the Jordan Peterson debate.
00:47:13 And he raised an example in that that I want to dig into more about where it came from
00:47:18 and who said it originally, because I think he was quoting.
00:47:21 But he said something about, imagine a husband who is jealous of his wife.
00:47:27 He's convinced that his wife is cheating on him, and he's upset by it.
00:47:30 And he said that even if it's all true, the husband's jealousy is still pathological.
00:47:37 Because it's too late, it's already the ship sailed, and she's gone.
00:47:41 You know, I don't really know the explanation, but I think it's like,
00:47:44 well, you can't control what she's doing.
00:47:47 Like, if you are obsessing over this, and this is causing you great grief,
00:47:51 and you continue, you've got to do something.
00:47:55 Yeah, break it up, or do something about it.
00:47:57 Don't just be a fucking jealous, cucked husband who's upset about it.
00:48:01 Like, do something.
00:48:02 And I don't know.
00:48:05 I kind of feel like maybe that applies to his wife.
00:48:08 I don't know.
00:48:08 The point is, I don't feel bad for his wife.
00:48:10 I think his wife probably is.
00:48:11 Probably.
00:48:12 You know, this doesn't give me any...
00:48:13 I don't know, man.
00:48:13 And judging by the way she's acted on Twitter, I don't think you should feel sorry for her.
00:48:17 But...
00:48:18 She's what on Twitter?
00:48:19 Just the way she acted.
00:48:19 Just by the way she's acted.
00:48:21 Yeah, yeah.
00:48:21 I don't feel any sympathy for her.
00:48:23 I don't...
00:48:23 I'm not...
00:48:24 Even if Jared did her wrong, that doesn't make me think she's good, you know?
00:48:29 Nate, I'm curious, like, I know you say you hate cheaters,
00:48:32 but would you ever like...
00:48:34 Like, if you found out that...
00:48:38 What's her name?
00:48:38 The girl, Sapa Kanakin.
00:48:40 What am I thinking of?
00:48:41 Oh, Joanna Newsome.
00:48:43 If it turned out Joanna Newsome was cheating on a fucking...
00:48:46 What's this fuck?
00:48:47 Chewboy.
00:48:48 Andy, Andy...
00:48:49 If Andy...
00:48:49 Cuck...
00:48:50 Why can't I Cuck?
00:48:50 Why can't I Cuck?
00:48:50 Why can't I Cuck?
00:48:50 Why can't I Cuck?
00:48:51 Why can't I Cuck?
00:48:51 Why can't I Cuck?
00:48:51 Why can't I Cuck?
00:48:52 God damn it.
00:48:52 Samberg, Andy Samberg.
00:48:53 Say Andy's thing.
00:48:54 If you found out she was cheating on Andy Samberg,
00:48:56 would this affect your listening to her music at all?
00:48:59 Okay, you know, so unfortunately, I think that it probably would.
00:49:05 I don't think...
00:49:06 I think that it's...
00:49:06 That's amazing to me.
00:49:08 Like, I don't...
00:49:10 I don't want it to.
00:49:11 I just think that I'd be like, man, this sucks.
00:49:13 The thing is that like most...
00:49:14 I think, first of all, most creatives are damaged individuals,
00:49:19 and second of all, most people are doing something fucking.
00:49:23 I mean, I agree.
00:49:24 I just don't want to know about it.
00:49:26 I mean, it's just like I kind of assume that like there's always
00:49:30 going to be something about everybody that if I knew it,
00:49:34 I mean, even just...
00:49:35 Like there's lots of music I listen to from people who I think
00:49:38 are like politically fucking retarded or something.
00:49:41 And like, I know that.
00:49:43 And maybe it enters my mind every once in a while,
00:49:46 but like if the music is good, the music is good.
00:49:48 And like, I just kind of have to assume that if I knew everything
00:49:53 about everyone I listened to, I would not be able to listen to anything.
00:49:56 I mean, I think if I knew everything about any individual,
00:49:59 I would find them contemptible and disgusting,
00:50:01 because I'm sure people would feel the same way about me
00:50:03 if they knew like my innermost thoughts all the time.
00:50:06 So I agree.
00:50:07 But like, I just think this is why I don't want...
00:50:10 I don't want to know.
00:50:10 I don't want to know what's going on in people's heads.
00:50:11 It's really fascinating to me, though,
00:50:13 the like what gets into people's crop,
00:50:16 because it's like there are a lot of rappers, for instance,
00:50:19 who have literally murdered people,
00:50:23 and like nobody holds that against their music.
00:50:27 And then you've got like...
00:50:27 Like Pro Jarrod's a way worse person for cheating on his wife,
00:50:30 you know, potentially, as opposed to murderers.
00:50:32 Or like Kanye West, who like Kanye gets like totally assblasted
00:50:35 by like the whole black community for like wearing a Trump hat.
00:50:38 And it's like some...
00:50:38 You guys are listening to people who kill people.
00:50:41 And like people are like, oh, I don't listen to Kanye
00:50:43 because he has political opinions.
00:50:45 He has a hat.
00:50:46 I don't like.
00:50:48 It's a funny thing, dude.
00:50:49 It's a funny thing.
00:50:50 Someone on Twitter, I saw this was on the day
00:50:52 that the Pro Jarrod story broke.
00:50:54 Someone was like peanut butter, like normal boots,
00:50:58 when John Tron says his racist shit, like,
00:51:00 oh, fuck you, we don't want to be associated with you.
00:51:03 Pro Jarrod, when he treats on his wife,
00:51:05 oh, you know, we're sorry, man, you know,
00:51:07 hope things get better for you.
00:51:09 And I read this and I'm like, yeah, those aren't even similar.
00:51:12 Why would you, like, why is it hypocritical
00:51:14 to react differently to those two things?
00:51:16 It's like, oh, these two people
00:51:18 both did something that I disagree with.
00:51:21 Why is there not an equal outcry for both things?
00:51:24 Well, you know, I suppose they could be making the point
00:51:27 that like, you know, like cheating on one's wife
00:51:29 is more, you know.
00:51:30 I think being racist is worse than cheating on your wife.
00:51:32 Well, okay, I mean, we'd have to get into the discussion
00:51:34 of like, was it in fact racist?
00:51:36 You can make a case.
00:51:37 Okay, well, I'm just accepting this guy's premise.
00:51:39 Okay, if you accept the premise, then I'm with you.
00:51:42 John Tron said horrible.
00:51:42 I actually don't know what John Tron said
00:51:44 that was this event.
00:51:46 I'm unclear exactly.
00:51:47 Is that what he quoted in statistics?
00:51:49 It was willing to meet this guy on his own terms.
00:51:51 Okay, sure.
00:51:51 And I still hate it.
00:51:53 The John Tron thing was just that he made the awful mistake
00:51:56 of debating with Destiny.
00:51:58 And...
00:51:59 Well, yeah, fair enough.
00:52:01 And that was basically it.
00:52:02 It was just him and Destiny had a debate
00:52:04 about the fact that he was like into Sargon and shit
00:52:07 and like was kind of...
00:52:09 Now, there's a fucking thing
00:52:11 Oh, boy.
00:52:12 I have not had any more fun than making...
00:52:15 Like Sargon's current downfall
00:52:17 is the funniest thing in the fucking world.
00:52:19 I don't...
00:52:19 Okay, I've heard the thing...
00:52:21 I've heard the thing about joking about raping MPs.
00:52:24 I don't know what he actually said.
00:52:26 I don't know what an MP is.
00:52:27 Well, did he know where these two worlds...
00:52:30 Two worlds are colliding right now
00:52:32 because I'm over here just following Brexit news
00:52:36 as like hardcore and as intensely as possible.
00:52:38 Every day I wake up and I read the BBC.
00:52:41 And then like from like off screen,
00:52:44 like there's a glimmer of light in the distance.
00:52:46 I squint my eyes.
00:52:47 And then in three frames max,
00:52:50 there's a punch from who other than Sargon of Akkad
00:52:53 entering the political sphere out of fucking nowhere.
00:52:57 When?
00:52:57 I thought I left you behind.
00:52:59 How did you get here?
00:53:00 Ben, are you aware that Sargon is running for office in...
00:53:03 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:53:04 So I did.
00:53:05 I did.
00:53:05 Yeah, a position in the EU.
00:53:07 Dude, it is the funniest.
00:53:09 Fucking thing in the world.
00:53:09 I've seen clips of him just being like really belligerent
00:53:13 like in public, like at his public appearance.
00:53:15 Sargon of Akkad is a fucking moron.
00:53:18 He's an absolute moron.
00:53:18 He absolutely is a fucking moron.
00:53:20 And he is running for office that he...
00:53:23 Because the party that got him
00:53:27 is basically a totally irrelevant party
00:53:29 that is just clinging to him
00:53:31 because he is more relevant than they are.
00:53:33 So like they see him as like,
00:53:35 oh, famous YouTube guy.
00:53:36 This is our ticket.
00:53:37 This is our ticket too.
00:53:39 But the fact of the matter is that while Sargon is,
00:53:42 you know, somewhat internet famous,
00:53:44 he's not necessarily taken seriously
00:53:46 and less and less so
00:53:48 as he continues to make a fucking fool of himself.
00:53:51 And there's this great...
00:53:53 I highly recommend this particularly to Nate.
00:53:55 There's this YouTuber called Porcelain,
00:53:57 spelled P-O-R-S-A-L-I-N,
00:54:00 who does these like hour and a half long documentaries
00:54:03 about people that are extremely well made.
00:54:06 And he...
00:54:06 That sounds nifty.
00:54:08 He's definitely...
00:54:10 He himself is a like far right poll meme lord.
00:54:16 But the people who he rags on
00:54:18 are other like right wing people
00:54:21 who have just fucked up so badly
00:54:23 that they are now laughing socks
00:54:25 within their own community.
00:54:27 And so he has one about Sargon
00:54:29 that's like an hour 45 minutes,
00:54:30 fucking hilarious.
00:54:31 Just it goes to his entire history
00:54:33 and every dipshit move he's made.
00:54:37 But like the most recent one...
00:54:39 That almost feels scary in a way.
00:54:40 That almost feels like going back
00:54:41 to what we were talking about earlier
00:54:42 where it's like okay,
00:54:43 well, he's made mistakes,
00:54:45 but he's just made one too many
00:54:46 that broke the candles back
00:54:47 and now he has like a hit piece video about him.
00:54:49 That's the thing.
00:54:50 The thing about it though is that,
00:54:52 and this is why I'm bringing it up
00:54:53 because with Pro Jarrod,
00:54:55 I'm like guy cheats on his wife.
00:54:57 That's unfortunate.
00:54:59 It's bedroom politics.
00:55:02 I have nothing to do with it.
00:55:03 You guys sort that out.
00:55:04 With Sargon, he's running for office.
00:55:07 So what he does, does matter.
00:55:10 What he says, what his like positions are
00:55:13 when he's saying it in interviews.
00:55:15 It's like the entertainment value
00:55:17 in watching this man dig his own grave
00:55:19 is in that he is so self-important
00:55:22 that he believes that he's doing something good.
00:55:25 Like it's one thing if like say,
00:55:28 if something I did,
00:55:29 like let's say I did some heinous act
00:55:32 and it came to light,
00:55:33 my best course of action would be to apologize, right?
00:55:36 It would be like, hey man,
00:55:37 I'm sorry about what happened.
00:55:39 This was something that happened in my day-to-day life.
00:55:41 Maybe there's more context or something.
00:55:43 I don't know.
00:55:44 Like this is a fictional scenario.
00:55:46 But with Sargon,
00:55:47 this is his public statements
00:55:49 as a man running for office.
00:55:51 Like as a public figure,
00:55:53 he is saying and doing things
00:55:55 that are so hilariously retarded
00:55:58 that you have to make fun of him
00:56:01 so that people understand
00:56:03 that if you're going to run for office,
00:56:05 you can't do these things.
00:56:07 What's he saying?
00:56:08 The most recent one and funniest is
00:56:11 he was defending Amos Yee.
00:56:14 You guys remember that guy, right?
00:56:16 I do.
00:56:17 Amos Yee, yeah.
00:56:18 Yeah, he's a pro pedophile guy.
00:56:20 He patroned me and Jesse for a little while.
00:56:24 He was a pedophile who is like,
00:56:28 he's like the world's-
00:56:29 I don't think he is specifically a pedophile.
00:56:31 No, he is.
00:56:31 He's been to jail several times for pedophilia.
00:56:34 Okay, if you say so.
00:56:35 He is a many times incriminated pedophile
00:56:40 who is also like a public defender of pedophilia.
00:56:43 And basically his platform is
00:56:45 that because there have been cases
00:56:49 wherein the child was not harmed
00:56:52 or wherein the child enjoyed the relationship,
00:56:55 it therefore is not always not okay.
00:56:57 Did this guy have you-
00:56:59 Want you to read a thing on how they marketed?
00:57:02 Yes, I did a bit on him and how they marketed
00:57:04 because he wanted me to market his video
00:57:07 defending pedophilia.
00:57:09 And I just made a clip talking about it
00:57:13 and explaining why I thought it was wrongheaded.
00:57:16 Because the bottom line is
00:57:18 there's no way to measure the psychological damage
00:57:21 done to somebody.
00:57:22 It's like you can't say,
00:57:24 oh, the kid enjoyed it and therefore it's okay.
00:57:27 It's like you don't know what the long-term effect
00:57:30 of that could be.
00:57:31 There's so many questions to be asked
00:57:33 and it's like in this sphere,
00:57:35 there's always going to be an arbitrary line.
00:57:37 You know, what we decide is the age
00:57:40 is always going to be arbitrary,
00:57:41 but we have to have something
00:57:43 just so that we as a society can say,
00:57:45 all right, here's a hard and fast rule,
00:57:47 just follow this rule.
00:57:49 The bottom line is-
00:57:49 And to be fair, to be fair to his point,
00:57:52 we are technically repressing some freedoms,
00:57:54 but it's for protection.
00:57:56 We repress freedoms all the time.
00:57:58 The whole basis of society is repressive.
00:58:00 You don't have the freedom to murder people
00:58:02 because we repress that.
00:58:04 It's like, dude, the bottom line is
00:58:07 you don't have to fuck kids.
00:58:09 You can just wait till they grow up.
00:58:11 How hard is that?
00:58:13 Oh yeah, but let's get back to the Sargon issue.
00:58:15 So Sargon had apparently defended Amos Ye at some point,
00:58:20 so this gets brought up in an interview
00:58:23 for a political interview.
00:58:25 It is important how he defended him
00:58:27 because there's a lot of different ways to defend him.
00:58:28 Well, he basically restated his argument.
00:58:30 He literally said, like,
00:58:32 well, you can't say it's always bad
00:58:34 if sometimes it goes okay,
00:58:36 and everyone was just like, all right, Sargon.
00:58:37 But I mean, that's true.
00:58:38 All right, go ahead and say it.
00:58:40 Yeah, all right, all right.
00:58:42 It was just, yeah.
00:58:43 The fascinating thing about all this
00:58:45 is I'm actually a big Sargon fan.
00:58:48 A big Sargon fan.
00:58:49 Are you really?
00:58:50 And I really am.
00:58:51 I unironically am.
00:58:52 How?
00:58:53 That guy's so retarded.
00:58:54 He's a complete stooge.
00:58:56 Look, I'll tell you how.
00:58:57 It's because where you guys are asserting
00:58:59 that he's, you know, like a grandstander
00:59:02 and, you know, I don't know,
00:59:04 doing it maybe for attention or something.
00:59:06 I mean, I've been convinced, maybe I'm crazy,
00:59:08 I've been convinced he's doing it for principles
00:59:10 that he believes.
00:59:10 Oh, no, I totally think he's doing it for principles.
00:59:12 What are you talking about?
00:59:13 I never said he was a grandstander.
00:59:15 He's just retarded.
00:59:16 Yeah, okay, for no.
00:59:17 Oh, I mean, you can make a case for that, sure.
00:59:19 I used to sort of like his content
00:59:21 and then I stopped caring.
00:59:23 He is like, he is just a complete, like, alt-right stooge.
00:59:26 He doesn't even know what he's doing.
00:59:27 Ben, he's not even on the alt-right.
00:59:28 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
00:59:29 Listen, listen, listen.
00:59:30 He doesn't even get it.
00:59:31 He doesn't even know that he's doing it half the time.
00:59:34 But he just...
00:59:36 Why do you think he's no better than the guy?
00:59:37 He's just thoughtless in the things that he repeats.
00:59:41 I agree with what you're saying, Ben,
00:59:43 that he is thoughtless.
00:59:44 I don't think that that,
00:59:45 I don't think he has led himself to the conclusions
00:59:48 that alt-right people have.
00:59:50 No, that's not what I'm saying.
00:59:52 I mean, he argues all day against identitarianism.
00:59:54 He does function as an unwitting mouthpiece
00:59:57 for like conservative fucking, I don't know.
01:00:01 I mean, I've seen some Sargon stuff.
01:00:03 I've never seen him be a mouthpiece for conservative...
01:00:06 Ben, what's the position that he is a mouthpiece on
01:00:08 that he's unaware of, if you can think of something?
01:00:11 I mean, isn't he kind of in bed with like, metaphorically,
01:00:14 not in like a pro-Jarrod kind of way, you know what I'm saying?
01:00:17 There he goes.
01:00:18 But he's kind of in bed with like, Lauren Southern
01:00:20 and that fucking guy who sells the brain pills and...
01:00:23 Alex Jones, you mean?
01:00:24 The brain pills?
01:00:24 No, not Alex Jones, well, maybe him, but the guy who just...
01:00:29 No, the fucking...
01:00:29 Paul Joseph Watson?
01:00:30 Ben, I mean, okay.
01:00:31 Yeah, well, Watson, Watson.
01:00:32 I'm not, this isn't, I'm not trying to catch or anything,
01:00:34 but like, I asked you for like a position
01:00:36 and you're saying he's associated with these people, therefore.
01:00:39 And that doesn't seem like it.
01:00:40 Well, isn't he?
01:00:41 Okay, isn't, okay, I'll give a position.
01:00:43 It's, he kind of seems like he's one of these,
01:00:46 like, Islamophobic, like, you know, no, no refugees ever,
01:00:50 kind of.
01:00:51 I mean, he definitely believes strongly in border control,
01:00:54 but I just think there's a principled argument to make for it,
01:00:56 for, I mean, in his case, the sake of the British populace
01:00:59 and protecting their lower classes from immigration,
01:01:02 which pushes down wages, which is bad for their people.
01:01:05 And I mean, you can argue that,
01:01:06 you can say that he has malicious intent or something,
01:01:09 but I mean, I think his case is reasonable.
01:01:10 You're misreading me.
01:01:11 I'm not saying that he has malicious intent.
01:01:13 I'm sure he does believe the things he says
01:01:15 and generally thinks that he is saying the right things
01:01:20 for the right reasons with good intentions.
01:01:23 I just think he is a stooge, no fucking clue.
01:01:27 Just the only question of this is,
01:01:28 so do you, do you think it's fair to say that like,
01:01:30 like you said, if he's reaching the same conclusion
01:01:33 as alt-right people, let's say, of, you know,
01:01:35 close the borders, something like that, then reaching that
01:01:38 for any reason is like playing into the hands,
01:01:41 even when you have like a decent argument for it?
01:01:46 Because I mean, what can you do?
01:01:46 What can you do if you really believe it?
01:01:49 You could get smart for one thing.
01:01:51 Well, here, okay, here's what I'm saying.
01:01:53 I mean, I've seen like, okay, in particular,
01:01:56 I've seen videos from Sean, the YouTuber Sean,
01:01:58 where he deconstructs Sargon's points and stuff
01:02:02 and arguments that Sargon has made
01:02:03 and shows that like the things he is quoting are wrong.
01:02:07 That he is like knowingly or not,
01:02:09 he is quoting like, you know, Nazi sympathizers and stuff.
01:02:12 He is repeating facts that are demonstrably false.
01:02:15 Things like that, okay.
01:02:17 You gotta remember, you know,
01:02:19 Hitler was right about some things, you know, like,
01:02:23 everybody's right about some things.
01:02:26 Even a broken clock gets right to two times a day, as they say.
01:02:30 Right.
01:02:30 Is that true?
01:02:31 Is that, have we tested that?
01:02:34 I just think it's unfair to say that just because
01:02:37 an alt-right person also said the thing that, like,
01:02:41 to me, alt-right is a totalizing position.
01:02:44 It's like, if you don't believe literally all of the things,
01:02:48 then you're not that.
01:02:49 Alt-right breathes air.
01:02:52 I, that's true.
01:02:53 Do you condemn the breathing of air, I guess?
01:02:55 That's solid, solid.
01:02:58 Two things.
01:03:00 Number one, I just want to comment on this MOC guy.
01:03:02 He looks like, like, if you put, like, the dryer on high,
01:03:07 you three Econin, like, left them there for like six hours
01:03:10 and he tumbled out and, like, was completely broken.
01:03:13 Like, his hair is just constantly unkempt and just, like,
01:03:16 it just obliterated his, like, more, like, like, like,
01:03:20 like, if Econ's atoms were just, like, splattered,
01:03:22 maybe, like, like a millimeter or something,
01:03:25 but now he's just constantly, like, a being of chaos.
01:03:28 Also, number two, I wanted to comment on Sargon of Cod,
01:03:31 not in a political sense, but more like a political analysis sense
01:03:34 about what, giving a little more context about him running.
01:03:38 So he has joined the UK Independence Party,
01:03:42 which was the original party behind Brexit,
01:03:45 well, not behind, you know, a major proponent and whatnot.
01:03:48 And what's funny about UKIP is they are in a fucking tailspin right now,
01:03:54 and they and the leading party of the conservatives
01:03:58 are just fucking dean obliterated
01:04:00 when you hear conservatives don't think
01:04:02 conservative America is different.
01:04:05 Right, right.
01:04:05 But so UKIP was the Nigel Farage party,
01:04:09 but now Nigel Farage left,
01:04:11 and so now they've just been in that for that and numerous other reasons.
01:04:17 They've just been crashing and burning.
01:04:18 And so I like the aesthetic, the image, the painting
01:04:23 that is being depicted in real life of UKIP,
01:04:26 soaring high, getting, you know, Brexit, the vote,
01:04:29 and they've just been a victorious moment,
01:04:32 and then just through the constant struggle of Brexit,
01:04:34 Nigel Farage leaving due to controversy within the group,
01:04:37 and now they're just, like, in, like, a burning sinking ship.
01:04:39 They're like, oh, god, who's our poster child?
01:04:41 Who's our poster child?
01:04:43 We need a new fucking guy!
01:04:45 Sargon of Akkad, that works!
01:04:46 That's fine!
01:04:48 Anyone, anyone!
01:04:49 It's the two-headed dragon of Sargon of Akkad and, um, Count Dankula.
01:04:54 Count Dankula, which Count Dankula seems like he's in it for the meme.
01:05:00 Like, he, he's always just looks like a smiley fucking guy.
01:05:04 He's just like, yeah, like, I don't know if any of this is working or doing anything,
01:05:09 but I'm here, because this is, this is clearly hilarious.
01:05:14 Sargon, meanwhile, is taking it completely seriously,
01:05:16 and everyone's just laughing at him.
01:05:19 Well, here's one of the reasons why I like the guy.
01:05:22 I mean, sure, okay, but he just got his entire channel demonetized,
01:05:26 and what is his response?
01:05:28 I'm gonna keep going.
01:05:29 I mean, is this the mark of, like, a bad person or someone who's, you know...
01:05:33 Nate, fucking, do you realize how much fucking...
01:05:36 That restarted his career.
01:05:38 Like, this dude was not really relevant,
01:05:40 and then suddenly everybody's talking about him again, because...
01:05:42 I mean, how is 800,000 subs irrelevant?
01:05:45 I mean, he's making a fine living doing his shit.
01:05:47 Okay, having subscribers has nothing to do with relevance.
01:05:50 What is his fucking view count?
01:05:52 Well, you just made it about relevance.
01:05:54 No, I'm saying that view, I'm saying subscriber count does not imply relevance.
01:05:57 You can have dead subs forever.
01:05:59 Okay, sure, that's, that's fair.
01:06:01 His videos get decent view counts, don't they?
01:06:03 I don't think like there's...
01:06:04 It's not that I'm saying he's not, like, at...
01:06:06 Like, I'm not saying he's not at all relevant.
01:06:09 Like, he literally is nobody now.
01:06:10 I'm saying that, like, at the height of Gamergate, he was the guy.
01:06:15 Like, he was the guy who made that movement as big as it is.
01:06:19 And now...
01:06:20 Those are the days.
01:06:21 Now, you know, and he's been trying to somehow get back to that.
01:06:25 I don't know if you saw the whole...
01:06:26 I mean...
01:06:26 Oh, you just gotta watch the fucking documentary, god damn it.
01:06:28 What better argument is there against Sargon of Akkad
01:06:31 that he was a Gamergate guy?
01:06:33 He was the Gamergate guy.
01:06:35 I mean, again, we would just reach totally different conclusions on that
01:06:38 than we have as we have in the pack.
01:06:39 I guess so.
01:06:40 Here's an example.
01:06:41 Here's an example.
01:06:42 This comes from Sean on his Curious Cat.
01:06:44 Example of Sargon being a stooge.
01:06:46 He repeats the fascist lie that Heather Hayer died of a heart attack
01:06:50 because she was unfit rather than being hit by a car
01:06:52 driven by James Fields at Charlottesville.
01:06:55 This was someone was hit by a car at a protest or something.
01:06:58 And the right falsely spread the rumor
01:07:01 that she actually died of a heart attack.
01:07:03 Ha ha ha, isn't that funny?
01:07:05 No, she was just murdered because someone ran her over...
01:07:07 Okay, sure.
01:07:08 ...because a fucking right-winger ran her over with a car.
01:07:09 Okay, great.
01:07:10 We've heard his side.
01:07:10 Now we need to dive into exactly what situation he said that in.
01:07:14 I mean, maybe our boy Sean is literally lying
01:07:16 and it was like a joke, he said.
01:07:18 I don't know.
01:07:18 I don't know.
01:07:19 I need to find out.
01:07:19 I'm totally willing to believe that Sargon just heard that
01:07:22 and thought it was true.
01:07:24 Yes, and that's what I think he does.
01:07:26 Right.
01:07:26 Well, that's why I think he's a moron,
01:07:28 because it has nothing to do with his political opinions.
01:07:31 I don't give a shit.
01:07:32 It's just the way he presents himself in talks
01:07:35 that like, I get the sense that this dude
01:07:39 like just kind of, you know,
01:07:41 listens to the talking points of other people,
01:07:44 collects the ones that sound good and parrots them,
01:07:46 and then has no...
01:07:47 The ones that support his,
01:07:49 the ones that support his sort of general...
01:07:51 Right, and he has no idea how to really defend those things in argument.
01:07:55 Because like, when Sargon makes scripted content,
01:07:58 he's just like, you know, making a formulated point
01:08:01 on the basis of whatever data he has.
01:08:04 And that can come out fine a lot more easily.
01:08:06 If you listen to the man debate anyone,
01:08:09 he clowns himself into oblivion.
01:08:12 He is so bad at debating.
01:08:15 He just kind of talks over people and shuts them down
01:08:17 and continually insists that they're not really listening to him or that...
01:08:20 Or like, he just...
01:08:22 It's really embarrassing.
01:08:23 Actually, I watched recently a video of him talking to an interviewer
01:08:26 and she completely didn't listen to him at all.
01:08:29 And like, no matter what he said,
01:08:30 she just kept pressing her own words and questions.
01:08:34 And it's just...
01:08:35 Anytime you talk to the mainstream media,
01:08:36 you're fucked because they don't give a shit.
01:08:38 Yeah, it was just so aggravating.
01:08:40 I stopped watching.
01:08:42 It was me and Byter, we were watching together
01:08:44 and I was like, Byter, stop.
01:08:45 No, I don't want to watch anymore.
01:08:47 Was that the Sky News clip?
01:08:48 There was a whole clip I was seeing about Sky News
01:08:50 put out this video where they heavily doctored it,
01:08:52 but he secretly recorded the whole thing
01:08:54 and the context was totally different there.
01:08:56 I just know he was talking to a female interviewer
01:08:59 and she was...
01:08:59 That's a totally different context
01:09:00 because the mainstream media will fuck you
01:09:02 no matter who you are to further their own agenda.
01:09:06 But Sargon, when he debates people on the internet,
01:09:09 like internet, blood sports, whatever the fuck you want to call it,
01:09:11 he's not a good debater.
01:09:13 He says a lot of stupid things and that's gotten him in trouble.
01:09:16 He always tries to do this thing where he...
01:09:19 He always tries to be clever.
01:09:21 Like, he's always trying to throw what you say back at you
01:09:24 or try to find a way to make it into a funny joke
01:09:27 and he's really bad at it.
01:09:30 Again, I would recommend the Porcelain documentary on him.
01:09:33 It's basically a chronicle of his whole career,
01:09:36 I mean, everything he's ever done
01:09:38 and why exactly his own team is turning against him now.
01:09:43 It's pretty funny.
01:09:43 What do you mean by his own team?
01:09:44 Is that like UKIP or his employees?
01:09:46 No, all the other right-wing YouTube crew.
01:09:49 Everybody in the skeptic community...
01:09:51 Who's the right-wing YouTube crew?
01:09:53 Just everybody.
01:09:55 Well, the main guy who's sort of...
01:09:57 The main reason, I think,
01:09:59 that he's gotten into heat with his community
01:10:02 is because he's beefing with Mr. Medeker
01:10:05 and looking like the asshole in that beef.
01:10:09 And so because people...
01:10:10 And also the Ralph Rettort.
01:10:12 So like, because Medeker and Ralph
01:10:13 are sort of the more relevant voices now
01:10:16 and are memeing on him so fucking hard,
01:10:20 it's turning a lot of people against him.
01:10:23 It doesn't surprise me at all that Medeker is memeing on him.
01:10:26 Medeker takes the piss out of everybody
01:10:27 when they treat anything with any sort of seriousness.
01:10:31 Medeker seems to be there to just laugh at them.
01:10:33 So if he starts running for office,
01:10:34 of course Mr. Medeker is going to shit on him.
01:10:35 That just seems like his wheelhouse.
01:10:37 It's more intimate than that.
01:10:41 It's more than just guys making videos about each other.
01:10:44 It's like there's a legit beef.
01:10:47 Just I don't want to go into all this
01:10:49 because I had to watch an hour and 45 minutes
01:10:51 of all this being explained to me.
01:10:53 We are being People Magazine right now for isolates.
01:10:56 I'm seeing Ethan Ralph tweeting about the breaking news of Sargon
01:11:00 and it is UKIP's Carl Benjamin hit by milkshake in Salisbury
01:11:04 in fourth attack this week.
01:11:06 Damn.
01:11:07 Now see, that's not okay.
01:11:10 Don't fucking throw milkshakes at a guy just because we're talking.
01:11:12 I mean, no, it's kind of funny, but it's no.
01:11:15 I don't think it's...
01:11:16 I can accept that.
01:11:18 You're just making his case stronger by doing that.
01:11:20 Yeah.
01:11:23 I'm just over here leaning back in my chair
01:11:25 just with the rag-to-wee theme playing in my head
01:11:29 with my glass of fine wine.
01:11:31 The glass of fine red wine.
01:11:32 It wasn't even just wine.
01:11:33 It was the fourth milkshake.
01:11:35 Yeah, the fourth milkshake.
01:11:37 And reminiscing about how in the Skype calls,
01:11:41 I would be talking to Gigi's ex-girlfriend Cookie Cutter
01:11:44 about Gamergate and talking...
01:11:46 And I was linking to her talking about the state of video games at the time.
01:11:49 He hit Cookie Cutter on the show.
01:11:50 Yeah, great idea.
01:11:52 And I thought about each hand.
01:11:53 It was just a glorious time.
01:11:54 You see, guys, I understand.
01:11:56 I'm sure Sargon's done many stupid things.
01:11:59 I've heard many of them myself.
01:12:00 And that's...
01:12:01 And perhaps I'm the naive one.
01:12:02 Perhaps I'm the fool who's just hearing the things I want to hear
01:12:06 and discarding all things that are relevant.
01:12:08 Totally possible.
01:12:09 It's just that when I hear things like him getting shut down monetarily
01:12:13 and getting milkshakes thrown at him,
01:12:15 and I see his videos and he's like,
01:12:17 not going to stop me.
01:12:18 I'm like, that seems like an honorable person.
01:12:20 I mean, that's okay.
01:12:21 Because...
01:12:22 But I'm not going to stop him from doing what.
01:12:24 Nate, if you understand...
01:12:25 I don't know, trying to lead UK to the independence that he thinks it needs.
01:12:28 And I'm like, I don't know, UK.
01:12:30 Sure, go for it.
01:12:31 Look, it's so fucking easy to spin that shit.
01:12:35 Not just...
01:12:35 Okay, people are doing that to him and that sucks.
01:12:39 It sucks that people are doing that.
01:12:41 But to act like him soldiering on through that is such a bold move.
01:12:47 It's like all those things will empower him.
01:12:49 They make his position stronger.
01:12:51 But I already agree with his position.
01:12:53 So I mean, it's working out pretty well.
01:12:55 It's like he gets to play the victim now.
01:12:57 And don't give me any of this fucking shit, people.
01:12:59 I don't agree with every position he has, Jesus Christ.
01:13:01 Well, it's not like he arranged this to like,
01:13:03 oh, now I'm going to make sure people hate me
01:13:06 so I can play the victim in their court.
01:13:08 I don't even think...
01:13:08 What?
01:13:09 I don't even think that.
01:13:10 I just think that if people act...
01:13:12 Well, here's my advice to people who don't like Sargon.
01:13:15 Don't throw a fucking milkshake at him
01:13:17 because you're going to empower the position.
01:13:19 Like, you are doing the opposite of him.
01:13:20 And victimhood is not proof that your argument is correct.
01:13:22 I totally accept that.
01:13:25 What specifically do you agree with him about?
01:13:27 I mean, how about the fact that the UK should have the right
01:13:30 to determine whether or not it wants to open its borders to immigrants.
01:13:33 Therefore, it should leave the EU so it can control that.
01:13:35 Seems reasonable to me.
01:13:37 Sure.
01:13:37 I mean, yeah.
01:13:38 That seems to be like the major issue.
01:13:39 I can see the logic.
01:13:41 I mean, that seems to be his entire platform right now, right?
01:13:44 Because like, Brexit's been dragged out for what?
01:13:46 Like, three years now and people won't have another vote or some shit?
01:13:50 It was supposed to happen in March.
01:13:52 Dude, it was supposed to happen several times over by now.
01:13:55 I mean, the official, like, actual big dick date was, yeah, in March.
01:14:00 Now it's in...
01:14:01 I believe they pushed it back to November,
01:14:03 but that's a definitely 100% no fucking way happening.
01:14:09 I see it in 2020.
01:14:11 If then, dude.
01:14:12 I see it if then.
01:14:13 I think the goal right now seems to be just wear the people out
01:14:18 so the UK stays in the EU.
01:14:20 Yeah.
01:14:20 I mean, that could possibly be the goal for some people.
01:14:25 Dude, you hear people making the case for it every damn day.
01:14:28 By the MPs.
01:14:29 There was some fucking lady debating on...
01:14:30 I mean, I'm sure this argument is thrown around all the time.
01:14:32 That's like, okay, like, I get the idea that like, no, no, no.
01:14:37 The people were gaslighted and misinformed,
01:14:40 and therefore the first vote, like, it does not accurately reflect
01:14:45 what the British people would have thought.
01:14:47 Therefore, we need to either cancel it or try again or something.
01:14:52 But see, now we're getting into like the nitpick stuff of like little...
01:14:54 Of course, we have to cancel it and restart it after like three years
01:14:57 of our own gaslighting and fear mongering from mainstream media.
01:15:01 I like how literally every election has already functioned that way,
01:15:05 but because some people don't like the results of this one, it's suddenly...
01:15:08 Oh, yeah.
01:15:09 Yeah.
01:15:09 That's literally how the whole world is run.
01:15:12 All an election is, is a battle of propaganda.
01:15:15 At that time and place.
01:15:16 Well, Brexit has been just been a constant bag and forth between people
01:15:19 who really want Brexit and people who really don't,
01:15:21 and then just people trying to compromise,
01:15:23 but no one can come up with a proper compromise.
01:15:25 I mean, there is no compromise.
01:15:27 Either you leave the EU or you don't.
01:15:28 And I mean, you had a referendum and leave one.
01:15:32 And if you do like a pussyfoot, you know, like misstep,
01:15:37 and instead of going like hard Brexit, you know,
01:15:39 World Trade Organization rules.
01:15:41 If you just go somewhere in the middle and you know,
01:15:44 oh, this isn't what a lot of people want because it's not hard enough.
01:15:47 It's like too soft.
01:15:48 But like if you go for like a Norway style and like just give up your seat in the EU parliament,
01:15:54 just for no reason, just for like, you know, cause...
01:15:57 Yeah, it's just insane.
01:15:57 That's just not going to appease anyone.
01:15:59 That's just going to make everyone mad.
01:16:01 So it just seems like there's going to be no compromise.
01:16:03 And so now everyone's getting upset at everyone in power from every angle,
01:16:07 like even people who want it or mad people who want it,
01:16:09 even people who don't want it or mad people who don't want it,
01:16:11 because they don't want it, you know, hard enough.
01:16:13 Has everybody seen the CGP gray video about how there's literally no way
01:16:18 to give every people what they want because of the Ireland divide?
01:16:21 And how Ireland will...
01:16:23 I mean, it depends on who you're asking.
01:16:25 I mean, if you ask someone, if you ask like a conservative from...
01:16:31 You know, our conception of conservative from like the north of England.
01:16:34 The Tories.
01:16:36 Yeah, if you ask a hard line Brexiteer, it's the proper term, I should use that,
01:16:41 who's like not in Northern Ireland, they'll say,
01:16:43 yeah, just fucking World Trade Organization rules, we're out of that with any other country.
01:16:48 If you ask someone in Northern Ireland that obviously have a different opinion,
01:16:50 you know, no one can agree.
01:16:52 No one can agree.
01:16:53 I foresee great troubles.
01:16:56 I mean, if we're not, if you can't define already, this is a great troubles.
01:17:01 And I do mean troubles with the capital T there, astute listeners.
01:17:06 Indeed, indeed.
01:17:08 Well, fuck, I mean, I don't know.
01:17:10 So what have we learned?
01:17:12 I think that we've learned that when any two parties look at a particular object,
01:17:19 they most see the characteristics of that object that for whatever reason,
01:17:23 appeal the most to them, positively or negatively.
01:17:27 And I think Sargon is certainly one, we all are.
01:17:29 I want to say in closing, just to be clear, that like,
01:17:33 I'm not even going to say whether I agree or disagree with Sargon's politics.
01:17:37 It's more like I don't care and barely even know.
01:17:40 All I see is a man who makes a meme out of himself all the time unintentionally.
01:17:47 And the face of the man is the dopiest, most vacant, most self-important fucking face.
01:17:55 Mostly it's his face.
01:17:56 That's most of what I have a problem with, that he just looks like such a
01:17:59 fucking dipshit.
01:18:00 He just looks like he thinks that he's the smartest guy in the room,
01:18:03 everywhere he goes, but also has no idea what's happening.
01:18:07 You know what I mean?
01:18:08 Yeah, I mean, I would disagree with my conclusions, but I understand how you arrive there.
01:18:14 Yeah, fair enough.
01:18:17 So I've been playing some tabletop games lately.
01:18:22 Yeah?
01:18:23 You know who does that? Sargon of a cod.
01:18:25 Let's all go subscribe.
01:18:26 That's not true.
01:18:27 Is that true?
01:18:27 Yeah, no, he has a D&D thing he does like weekly.
01:18:30 Really?
01:18:30 How could he not do tabletop games?
01:18:32 The man's a fucking turbo nerd.
01:18:34 You know, maybe I underestimated this guy.
01:18:37 Yeah, going back to D&D.
01:18:39 Could he be the genius that we've waited for?
01:18:42 Well, I shouldn't say that I've started, but I'm participating in my first D&D campaign.
01:18:46 Your first ever, really?
01:18:47 Yeah, first ever.
01:18:48 Tell us about that.
01:18:50 Like I said, I've been watching the CT, I've been watching the Penny Arcade D&D stuff,
01:18:54 and I've been like, oh, it's fun.
01:18:57 I like it.
01:18:58 Despite our vast immeasurable differences, Ben, we're not so different, you and I.
01:19:03 You were just like me trying to make destiny.
01:19:09 Yes, question mark, question mark, question mark.
01:19:12 Anyway, I wish Hippo was here because he's in the D&D campaign.
01:19:15 Wait, wait, who's playing?
01:19:17 So it's me, Hippo, and a few other people from our friend circle outside the PCP,
01:19:24 and we're all hanging out.
01:19:26 I feel more specific, it is nameable.
01:19:29 Hang on, hang on one second.
01:19:30 I'm checking my notes.
01:19:32 I didn't authorize any friendships outside the PCP with you,
01:19:34 so we're going to need to cut that off.
01:19:36 You know, it's been a long time coming, you know, frankly.
01:19:38 Okay, you know, sure.
01:19:39 No, we got to get them on the payroll.
01:19:41 Oh, that's fair, as in paying us, as in paying us for the right to...
01:19:45 They're renting Munchie out as friend.
01:19:47 That is an exclusive PCP right, so they need to check with us.
01:19:52 The bin, you will know the DM, because it's 610,
01:19:57 the Hippo Pageant Model of Health and Treatment Services.
01:20:00 Yes, I've seen him on Twitter lately posting stuff about learning Japanese.
01:20:05 Yes, yes, yes.
01:20:07 So anyway, we're only a few sessions in.
01:20:10 Ganbarimashou.
01:20:11 It's very hard to do it.
01:20:14 What are you playing?
01:20:15 What's your character?
01:20:16 Uh, I am playing...
01:20:17 My character is a Prussian who wants to unify all ethnic Germans under one flag,
01:20:23 and not in a racist way, just in a cool way.
01:20:25 That's my boy.
01:20:27 What fucking game are you playing?
01:20:28 Not in a Hitler way, but in a Bismarck way.
01:20:31 Of course.
01:20:31 What game are you playing exactly?
01:20:34 Well, we're playing...
01:20:35 We're not playing D&D, we're playing a...
01:20:38 A...
01:20:39 Oh god, I don't know what it's fucking called.
01:20:40 Fate, I think?
01:20:42 Okay, I heard it.
01:20:43 I think it's called Fate.
01:20:44 Oh, I think I heard it.
01:20:46 It's very loose on rules.
01:20:47 It's very loose on rules.
01:20:50 Yeah.
01:20:50 Wait, is that the one?
01:20:51 It should be.
01:20:51 What's that?
01:20:52 There's some game...
01:20:54 I'm not sure if it's Fate, but there's one where you have to define everything about your character,
01:20:59 including the circumference of their anus.
01:21:02 Wow.
01:21:02 Oh no.
01:21:03 That sounds like Munchie's kind of thing.
01:21:06 Hold on, hold on.
01:21:07 Anal?
01:21:07 I'm circling.
01:21:08 Anal circumference.
01:21:11 Well, good luck on R&B.
01:21:12 I didn't have to define that.
01:21:14 Okay, no, no, no.
01:21:14 That one's called Fatal.
01:21:16 Okay, real quick.
01:21:17 Obviously, the center of your anus is always going to be a zero circumference.
01:21:20 Is this like the brown hole around it?
01:21:22 Well, I don't know about that.
01:21:24 It's how far it can stretch.
01:21:25 It's how far it can stretch.
01:21:26 Oh, okay.
01:21:27 Okay, okay.
01:21:27 That makes sense.
01:21:28 Yeah, we're talking about maximum circumference.
01:21:30 Right, of course.
01:21:32 Before you...
01:21:33 God, why did we waste all the time on Sargon when we could have talked about this the whole time?
01:21:36 I know.
01:21:37 What were we doing?
01:21:38 Talk about assholes.
01:21:38 I think the topics are one and the same.
01:21:42 Quote from Darren McLennan.
01:21:43 So basically, Fatal is the date rape RPG.
01:21:49 Sign me up.
01:21:50 But that's not what we're talking about.
01:21:52 Well, I mean, I wish it was.
01:21:54 You know what?
01:21:54 Oh, guys, PCPDD campaign by D&D.
01:21:58 I mean, a Fatal campaign.
01:22:00 I think that's a...
01:22:01 Sounds like a plan to do.
01:22:02 Yeah, I think it's in the near future.
01:22:03 I guess I'm in.
01:22:04 What's Hippo playing?
01:22:06 Hippo is playing a crippled boy, a crippled lad, who is on top of an aged Boston dynamic
01:22:13 robot, and the Boston dynamic robot carries him on.
01:22:16 Awesome.
01:22:16 That's cool.
01:22:17 I like it.
01:22:17 Awesome.
01:22:19 Well, tell them it.
01:22:20 Tell us about it.
01:22:22 I don't know if you want me to get into the raw fucking details or anything.
01:22:25 Yeah, a little bit.
01:22:25 Maybe an overview.
01:22:26 Yeah, whatever.
01:22:27 Okay.
01:22:28 Well, Sixen's whipped up this, again, not a very serious endeavor,
01:22:34 because I don't think anyone wants to do that, especially me.
01:22:37 I can't imagine a worse fate than tuning in for two hours to fucking hardcore roleplay
01:22:44 for realsies.
01:22:46 Honestly, that was my opinion before.
01:22:48 I'm starting to get a little bit more into it now that I have a firmer understanding of how
01:22:52 things work.
01:22:52 But nevertheless, Sixen is obviously a Swedish boy who's whipped up a Scandinavian escapade.
01:23:02 There isn't really a clear plot right now, but we're just hanging out and trying to get our
01:23:06 bearing straight and our sea legs.
01:23:09 Because, again, I've never done this before.
01:23:11 I think that no one else has done it before either besides Sixen who was DM'd before.
01:23:17 It's fun.
01:23:18 I want to play.
01:23:18 Is it fantasy?
01:23:19 Like, is there magic?
01:23:20 Are there monsters?
01:23:21 Yes.
01:23:21 Yes.
01:23:22 I describe it as like, imagine, it takes place in one of those post-apocalypse,
01:23:30 which just means that people have reverted back to medieval times,
01:23:32 but there's an excuse to have technology in it.
01:23:34 That's the way to do it, yeah.
01:23:37 So we're in sort of a middle ages runic setting, like Scandinavia.
01:23:43 Sounds pretty sick.
01:23:44 There's bards, there's magic, but there's also obviously Boston Dynamics robots,
01:23:48 and I have a pick a lot because, of course, I do.
01:23:50 Indeed, of course.
01:23:52 Why else would you play oppression for any reason?
01:23:54 Yeah, literally, unironically.
01:23:57 So, yeah.
01:23:58 So what's interesting about it to me is that it's sort of very weird experience,
01:24:06 because I am very, like, sort of weirdly far removed from roleplaying.
01:24:13 Obviously, legendarily, mythically, my old Pokemon roleplays are known throughout the land,
01:24:21 and I used to roleplay very heavily in the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon
01:24:26 fandom, but that was many years ago, and very different than a live-action Dean.
01:24:31 I'm just going to say D&D when I say what I mean.
01:24:33 That's fine, yeah.
01:24:33 I'll wheel you.
01:24:34 Yeah.
01:24:34 Yeah, okay.
01:24:35 I've never done a D&D thing like that.
01:24:36 And it's weird that all my conventions or ideas of how to create a good story
01:24:44 sort of don't apply, and when I try and do them, they're working against what it's meant to be.
01:24:51 And that's just like...
01:24:53 What do you mean?
01:24:54 What I mean by that is that, like, when you are presented with a scenario by the DM,
01:25:03 and you have to work through a problem, be it through diplomacy or with force,
01:25:10 it's not really...
01:25:11 It's instead of saying to yourself as a writer,
01:25:16 time to write an interesting exchange between two people, between two characters,
01:25:22 which I am crafting with my own hand, and I'm the deciding factor, it is I have to pretend
01:25:29 to be someone else and work for my own advantage, or the character's advantage, rather.
01:25:37 So instead of...
01:25:38 I mean, obviously, it's not like they are completely separate things, but instead of,
01:25:44 you know, writing arcs that I can very clearly define because I am in control of the scenario,
01:25:51 I am at the whim of the DM, and I am at the whim of wanting the best for myself.
01:25:57 So, obviously, while characters may want the best for themselves in fictional scenarios,
01:26:02 it's not so clear as in I have to make the decision, which will further my own goals,
01:26:07 and I have almost paradoxally, because I have more agency, I have less,
01:26:14 because I can't affect the game world, I can only affect my actions within it,
01:26:18 so I'm always going to be looking for positive scenarios for my characters,
01:26:23 which is not actually maybe the most interesting things that could happen.
01:26:27 Like, I'm never going to put myself in bad scenarios, or there is not a
01:26:32 eyebrow game player enough to do that yet.
01:26:36 If it's what your character would do...
01:26:38 Well, sure, but if it's not what the character would do, then I wouldn't do it.
01:26:42 But, I mean, the most interesting scenarios are when there's conflict.
01:26:46 That's true, yeah.
01:26:48 So, obviously, I'm not a... these are sort of like first impressions.
01:26:55 I don't know if what I said have made any sense,
01:26:58 since I'm still trying to work out the terminology in my mind.
01:27:00 I mean, I mean, I... to me, it's like, okay, you got your character,
01:27:05 you got his motivations, you got your stats, you got your dice,
01:27:09 you walk yourself into a conflict, and then it's like, you decide,
01:27:13 like, what would my character do if there's a conflict there?
01:27:16 You know, you roll the dice, you pick what stat you're using,
01:27:18 you pick what equipment you're using, and like, here's how I'm handling this.
01:27:22 And like, one thing about the C team that I've been watching is Tycho,
01:27:29 the DM, is always... he's always asking... it never ends with a,
01:27:33 this is what my character does, my character uses this spell,
01:27:36 my character, you know, uses this skill.
01:27:38 He always asks, like, okay, tell me what that looks like.
01:27:42 It's like, okay, I'm using Intimidate.
01:27:46 Rosie tries to intimidate someone, and he's like, okay,
01:27:49 but what does that look like?
01:27:50 And she's like, um, well, you know, I think Rosie would attune herself
01:27:55 to the plane of shadows, and she would like, I don't know,
01:27:58 maybe she would make like an extra plane of shadow,
01:28:00 like a loom up behind her to make herself look bigger or something,
01:28:04 and like, I don't know.
01:28:04 Like, there's like specific, like what... you know,
01:28:07 it's like the dice and stuff are sort of like a prompt,
01:28:09 they're sort of like a storytelling prompt.
01:28:11 And you can decide what things look like
01:28:13 and decide how things progress, but like within this boundary.
01:28:19 It sounds like a really good way of DMing.
01:28:21 Yeah, yeah, yeah, like, like, for example, like,
01:28:25 when he, like, when the warlock, when Cathriss summons a demon,
01:28:29 it's not just, oh, okay, I pick this demon,
01:28:33 and like, you know, I make this circle,
01:28:34 and the demon shows up, and I roll to command it, and stuff.
01:28:37 That's just the beginning,
01:28:39 because like, the demon will show up, and then he'll like,
01:28:42 they'll, they'll role play like a conversation with the demon,
01:28:45 where like, the demon will introduce himself,
01:28:47 and like, you'll find, he'll tell you his, his name and stuff,
01:28:49 and then they'll be like, they'll like discuss,
01:28:52 like, what am I here on this plane to achieve,
01:28:54 and like, why should, like, what will you pay me,
01:28:56 like, what will you give me in exchange for my services,
01:28:58 and stuff like that.
01:29:00 It is, it's a very, he digs in, he really digs into it.
01:29:02 Well, it sounds like a lot of fucking work to me, frankly.
01:29:04 Well, it's fucking, it's storytelling.
01:29:06 Yeah, I think that
01:29:09 D&D just falls into the same, I don't want to say problems,
01:29:12 because that implies negatives,
01:29:13 but just like hurdles that normal things don't,
01:29:16 because it's a game, you know, is a role playing game,
01:29:20 in which, you know, it's almost inherently about empowerment
01:29:24 to make it feel satisfying to you, the player,
01:29:27 who is engaged with it as a player.
01:29:30 So it's almost inherently supposed to be, again,
01:29:36 I keep coming back to this idea that
01:29:38 it's supposed to be positive for you,
01:29:39 where a lot of my most, the most interesting stories to me
01:29:43 are things in which characters fail,
01:29:45 or do they not accomplish their tasks,
01:29:46 or they are flawed in some way,
01:29:48 which I guess could apply to the D&D characters.
01:29:52 And obviously, it's, again, I don't want to seem,
01:29:55 imply that they are so radically different,
01:29:57 right in a good character, or being a good player,
01:30:00 but it's just a difference in perspective
01:30:03 that makes it suddenly different
01:30:05 in ways that I do think have somewhat massive implications,
01:30:10 when, again, you are not in control of the scenario,
01:30:12 and you just have to be empowered to make decisions
01:30:18 in which may not be the most interesting narratively,
01:30:21 but just make the most sense for the game at that present.
01:30:24 It sounds to me like you are grappling with the age,
01:30:28 the age-old conflict of role playing versus role playing
01:30:33 R-O-L-E versus R-O-L-L.
01:30:36 Is that, do I have the right of it?
01:30:39 I don't explain further.
01:30:42 Like, you know, there's the aspect of the game
01:30:44 that is about storytelling and playing a character,
01:30:46 and then there's the aspect that is about seeing numbers go up.
01:30:50 Right.
01:30:50 Well, yeah.
01:30:52 The most difficult thing about playing D&D
01:30:54 is when you have a group that's just interested
01:30:56 in rolling dice and swinging swords,
01:30:57 because that's, you can just go play a video game
01:30:59 if you want to just do combat and stuff.
01:31:01 That's how I see it.
01:31:02 That's me, my dudes.
01:31:03 When I play D&D, I'm like, I barely even look at my numbers
01:31:09 or my ability.
01:31:10 I'm not even interested.
01:31:11 The greatest...
01:31:12 That part is just sort of incident.
01:31:13 D&D's greatest strength is that you can do anything.
01:31:16 You know, the DM allows,
01:31:17 because you can say you want to do whatever you want,
01:31:19 as long as the DM allow you to make a check for it,
01:31:22 you're not bound by a preset amount of mechanics,
01:31:26 like a video game or something.
01:31:27 Anything you can think of, you can do,
01:31:29 and that's what really makes it interesting.
01:31:32 A lot of the times I've played with people are just like,
01:31:34 I'm just going to roll my dice and swing my sword.
01:31:35 I'm a fighter.
01:31:36 I'm just like, this is a slog.
01:31:37 You've got to play with it.
01:31:38 Like the best group I ever played with was early last year,
01:31:41 it was me and a couple buddies,
01:31:42 and we were all just really having fun with it,
01:31:45 and the DM was another of my friends.
01:31:48 He's really lax about things,
01:31:49 just to have everything be fun.
01:31:52 My character is like a half orc, way the drunken fist guy,
01:31:57 so I would have to drink whenever I would need to use drinking stuff.
01:32:00 So I'd be drunk halfway through the campaign.
01:32:02 Then my friend was a bard, and he brought his guitar,
01:32:03 and he'd just sing all the time,
01:32:05 just make up stupid songs the whole time we were playing,
01:32:07 and it was the best time ever.
01:32:08 That's right.
01:32:09 You also have to have a good DM for those sort of things,
01:32:11 because if the DM himself or herself,
01:32:14 they're interested in just rolling dice and swinging swords,
01:32:16 then you can't really have fun in that sort of way.
01:32:19 If you're interested in rolling dice and swinging swords,
01:32:21 you probably shouldn't be DMing,
01:32:23 because you have to add all the flavor
01:32:24 that binds everything together.
01:32:26 Did I tell you guys about...
01:32:27 It is extremely like numbers light.
01:32:31 There are very few instances where like our stats matter.
01:32:35 Well, I like that.
01:32:38 That's how they're like kind of game.
01:32:40 It's not as though you don't roll dice or anything like that,
01:32:43 and I will say my least favorite part of this experience so far
01:32:49 is rolling the dice,
01:32:50 because it just feels like it's random self-control
01:32:56 in a situation where it's like,
01:32:58 I know to not use like my finishing move or something
01:33:01 that effect in opportune moments,
01:33:03 so it wouldn't be narratively satisfying.
01:33:07 By the way, my finishing move is I can split things in half,
01:33:10 and only in half, 50%.
01:33:12 And I can do this two things, like all things.
01:33:15 So I can split like people in half,
01:33:18 but I can also split like atoms in half.
01:33:20 And cause a nuclear explosion.
01:33:22 Oh my God.
01:33:23 But anyway, I know to not use that all the time,
01:33:27 or else it would just be boring,
01:33:29 but rolls are just like when I want to do something,
01:33:33 that seems like it shouldn't really be an issue,
01:33:36 like just attacking someone.
01:33:38 You know, now it's just like,
01:33:39 oh, I have a chance to not do it,
01:33:41 and I just don't do it for some reason.
01:33:43 And now the DM has to come up with like a weird reason
01:33:45 why I just now suddenly don't for some reason.
01:33:48 It's your, well, it's your skill at attacking
01:33:50 versus their skill at avoiding your blow.
01:33:54 That's, you know, there's a conflict there.
01:33:56 There's two individuals each trying to achieve something
01:34:00 different.
01:34:01 It's not skill-based.
01:34:02 It's chance-based is what is the problem.
01:34:04 I mean, it always really comes down to that in the-
01:34:06 It is chance-based, yeah.
01:34:08 Yeah.
01:34:08 I mean, that's always been my biggest issue with D&D,
01:34:10 is that like there's so many times
01:34:13 where you can just get terrible RNG.
01:34:16 Like that was like the biggest problem
01:34:18 with that character I was talking about.
01:34:19 Thrax, the half orc drunk man, he would just constantly miss
01:34:22 even though his punches could like destroy anything.
01:34:25 And like the gimmick was just like,
01:34:27 he's so drunk, he can't hit anything, I guess,
01:34:28 because like my dice rolls always suck.
01:34:30 Dude, I've sounded somewhat negative here,
01:34:33 and I don't mean to be.
01:34:34 Hold on, I want to say that reminds me of in Morrowind,
01:34:38 in Elder Scrolls Morrowind,
01:34:40 you, it does a random number generator every time you attack.
01:34:43 So you can literally see your spear go into an enemy
01:34:47 and see the word miss pop up above their head.
01:34:50 D&D is a little better at that.
01:34:52 The first, when I tried to play that game,
01:34:55 all I did was like, I was in the starting village,
01:34:57 I just like walked out of it, tried to attack a monster,
01:35:00 missed like 12 times in a row,
01:35:02 and stopped playing the game forever.
01:35:05 That's understandable.
01:35:06 That's RPGs.
01:35:08 Yeah.
01:35:08 Well, I-
01:35:09 Well, it shouldn't be, I mean, like in an action RPG,
01:35:12 I feel like the whole point is that that abstraction isn't there.
01:35:16 That's true, I agree.
01:35:17 I think it makes sense.
01:35:18 I get it.
01:35:20 And in D&D, it's not that way,
01:35:22 because like really, you don't see what's happening,
01:35:24 what's happening if you're fighting like an armored guy
01:35:26 and you fail to overcome his, what's the AC stand for?
01:35:28 What's the-
01:35:28 Armor class.
01:35:29 Armor class.
01:35:29 Armor class, right.
01:35:30 Like you just chink, you're off his armor,
01:35:32 which makes sense.
01:35:33 He's got fucking armor on, your sword bounces off it,
01:35:35 or he's a speedy fuck.
01:35:36 Or he's a dodger, he's dodged your flow,
01:35:38 or there's a magical repulsion or something, you know?
01:35:41 So it feels unsatisfying,
01:35:42 but really it actually is perfectly reasonable.
01:35:45 It makes sense within the logic of the world,
01:35:46 but the problem is that the dice tend to rob you from agency
01:35:50 in a game that's biggest strength is that you can do whatever you want.
01:35:53 Yeah, I agree, Tom.
01:35:55 That's a good way to put it.
01:35:56 Well, I mean, I think the idea is that like,
01:35:58 you know, as your character advances and your numbers do go up,
01:36:01 you become more empowered to like make the things
01:36:05 that you want to see happen happen.
01:36:07 Well, of course, of course.
01:36:08 As you gain more spells,
01:36:09 and as you get better at doing things in general.
01:36:13 I know, I guess it's a whole, like it wouldn't be meaningful
01:36:16 that you can overcome a foe if you didn't have to work up to it,
01:36:18 if like in a previous version of yourself
01:36:21 would have failed at accomplishing this.
01:36:22 I think the only, I mean, I totally get it,
01:36:25 and I still love D&D on the whole.
01:36:26 That's why I made a whole video about how it's the greatest thing.
01:36:29 But the only issue is like, if you were playing a video game,
01:36:32 like if you were playing Final Fantasy VII
01:36:33 and like at level 1 through 10,
01:36:35 you have like a 50% miss rate, like you'd want to kill yourself.
01:36:39 And like D&D tends to have like a 30 to 50% miss rate,
01:36:42 especially at low levels.
01:36:44 That's true.
01:36:44 Because you're, you know,
01:36:45 you got to hit like 15 or something,
01:36:47 and if you're only getting like a plus four bonus at starting out,
01:36:50 like that leaves a lot of space for you to just fuck up.
01:36:52 This is unrelated to my experience,
01:36:54 because there are no levels,
01:36:55 and I don't know how that works in normal D&D.
01:36:59 But I probably come across as like negative
01:37:02 or like a non-enjoying experience,
01:37:04 but all contrary, my friend, I'm quite enjoying it.
01:37:07 It's just, it gets my brain percolating,
01:37:09 because it's again something that I have not experienced
01:37:11 in really a long time.
01:37:13 This idea of having to like work with other people
01:37:16 to achieve an error,
01:37:16 because obviously I have given my character faults,
01:37:19 and I've given my care,
01:37:20 I have a general idea of how I would like an arc to go
01:37:23 for said character.
01:37:24 But now I have to work that into what,
01:37:26 what Sixen wants is DM,
01:37:27 and what the other players do in the game,
01:37:30 and what situations we find ourselves in.
01:37:32 And I feel, again, it's a weird paradox
01:37:34 where I have agency in the sense
01:37:36 that I am controlling something,
01:37:38 but I have such a limited agency
01:37:39 in that I am at the whim of the DM and the other players
01:37:42 in a lot of circumstances.
01:37:44 And the dice, where I would want to maybe finish off
01:37:48 a character or a fight in some way,
01:37:50 which would be relevant to my character's arc,
01:37:52 but I simply cannot, because I can't get a good role.
01:37:56 And then I remember the first altercation where,
01:38:00 I mean, you know, this isn't a problem or anything,
01:38:02 but just this, this game, this is a good
01:38:04 sense I have for how the game will go,
01:38:06 where it's like I had a specific way
01:38:08 in which I wanted to finish off the first boss
01:38:11 that we encountered that would be relevant
01:38:13 to the character's arc.
01:38:15 But obviously, everyone else does two,
01:38:18 because everyone else is their own character,
01:38:20 and everyone else wants this to be relevant to their,
01:38:22 because they are the protagonists, they are the player.
01:38:24 So when the turns went, and I was,
01:38:28 like the person right before me got the kill,
01:38:31 and you know, in a particularly glorious way,
01:38:34 it was like, ah, shit, I have to be like better.
01:38:37 And by better, I mean luckier, I guess.
01:38:41 It's an interesting scenario.
01:38:42 I'm enjoying it, I wish Hippo was here,
01:38:46 you know, he is a part of it after all.
01:38:47 I want to, maybe next week we can hear his thoughts.
01:38:51 Sure.
01:38:51 You guys can fucking hash it out.
01:38:54 Yeah.
01:38:54 My, again, my thoughts may seem negative,
01:38:57 but they're merely contemplative,
01:38:59 they're merely contemplative on the philosophical quandaries
01:39:02 they have, well, plain D&D.
01:39:04 Contemplative, that word should be pronounced.
01:39:06 If you're interested, there's obviously way more details
01:39:09 that I'm sparing the audience for,
01:39:10 because I'm sure it'll be really boring,
01:39:11 but if you're interested, we can really wrap it up.
01:39:13 Yeah, sure.
01:39:15 I don't want to say I've been playing a game,
01:39:16 I've been playing a game with some friends
01:39:18 being DM'd by a friend of mine.
01:39:21 It's called Dogs in the Vineyard, and you play,
01:39:24 and yeah, and you play as a dog, a dog of the faith,
01:39:30 and the faith is a, you are basically a combination,
01:39:33 I said this before, I'm sorry if I'm repeating myself,
01:39:34 but the audience didn't hear it yet.
01:39:36 You are a combination mailman slash missionary
01:39:40 slash detective slash lethal enforcer
01:39:43 slash pizza hut slash Taco Bell.
01:39:46 For the, for a fictional version
01:39:49 in like a fictionalized United States
01:39:51 of like the Mormon Church.
01:39:53 Okay, okay.
01:39:54 Oh, and in Deseret?
01:39:56 I, what?
01:39:57 A Deseret is the proposed Mormon super state,
01:40:00 if you don't know what it is,
01:40:01 obviously it does not take place there.
01:40:03 I haven't heard that term so no,
01:40:05 but this is like an alternate,
01:40:06 there's a couple of things that are different,
01:40:08 that went different, like the history of China,
01:40:10 there was some kind of like holy rebellion
01:40:12 in China that succeeded in this world
01:40:13 that didn't in the real world.
01:40:15 Okay.
01:40:15 Yeah, there's more to it.
01:40:16 There's still time, China, get to it.
01:40:20 But yeah, and you have a big coat,
01:40:21 you have like a custom coat,
01:40:23 because this is like a part of your mark of office,
01:40:24 like the people in your community.
01:40:26 So you're not a literal dog, are you?
01:40:28 No, no, no, no, no.
01:40:29 Okay, okay.
01:40:30 Dog is your type.
01:40:30 Gotcha, gotcha.
01:40:31 And you are this, you are a guy,
01:40:34 you are a fucking going around,
01:40:35 you're like a holy warrior for Mormonism.
01:40:37 And...
01:40:38 Sick.
01:40:39 My character is Charlie Yang.
01:40:43 That's Chinese.
01:40:44 He is Chinese, he is the son of immigrant railroad workers,
01:40:49 but he is deeply resentful of his,
01:40:51 he just wants to assimilate,
01:40:53 he just wants to fit in,
01:40:54 he resents his parents for being workers,
01:40:56 he resents them for being Chinese,
01:40:58 he resents white people for not,
01:41:00 for seeing him as different.
01:41:02 He's a very resentful, conflicted guy,
01:41:07 but he has a cool coat with a dragon on it.
01:41:10 Well, fantastic.
01:41:11 Is this like a battle series?
01:41:14 Well, there is fight,
01:41:15 like we came to this town for,
01:41:17 the DM sent us to this town for,
01:41:19 they were tithing too much,
01:41:20 and we suspected that something was wrong there.
01:41:23 And it turns out that, yeah, they were,
01:41:24 they were overworking their,
01:41:26 like there's strict strictures in the book of Enoch,
01:41:29 laying out like how,
01:41:30 basically they're laying out like workers need,
01:41:32 you know, they shouldn't work too many hours in a week,
01:41:34 they need at least one day off a week.
01:41:35 Sure.
01:41:36 And they were not observing,
01:41:38 they were not observing these things.
01:41:40 Those bastards.
01:41:40 Turned out,
01:41:41 turned out there was a cult going on,
01:41:43 and there was like some demonic possessions,
01:41:44 we had to baptize a baby that had a demon in it,
01:41:47 we had to name the baby,
01:41:48 we had to fucking,
01:41:49 we had to, we had to fucking kill a few guys,
01:41:51 they were doing some demon shit,
01:41:52 and that wasn't cool.
01:41:53 Yeah.
01:41:54 I try, I try so hard,
01:41:56 I am like, I'm playing my guy as like a complete conciliator
01:41:59 who's tries to avoid conflict at all times,
01:42:01 who just wants to,
01:42:02 he just wants to save souls,
01:42:03 he doesn't pull his gun out unless,
01:42:05 things aren't really bad,
01:42:06 there was a shootout,
01:42:07 people were shooting at us from the windows,
01:42:08 I had to lasso a guy out a window,
01:42:10 you know, it was,
01:42:11 you know, it was,
01:42:11 it was pretty all right.
01:42:13 There were hatchets were thrown,
01:42:15 hatchets were embedded in skulls,
01:42:17 but you know what,
01:42:18 it's all for the king of life,
01:42:19 you know, praise him.
01:42:20 Is that the Mormon God or whatever?
01:42:22 Yes, in this world,
01:42:23 he's called the king of life.
01:42:24 Okay, sick, sick.
01:42:25 I have,
01:42:26 there's every one,
01:42:28 at one time I was like,
01:42:29 I think I had to,
01:42:31 I think I was trying to like,
01:42:32 exercise a house or something,
01:42:34 and I had to improv,
01:42:35 I had to improv like a,
01:42:37 like a passage from the,
01:42:39 from like the holy book or something,
01:42:40 I just came up with something on this,
01:42:42 but that's the kind of stuff I like.
01:42:44 Yeah, that's cool.
01:42:45 Like what would you,
01:42:46 what would you say?
01:42:47 Like what's a,
01:42:47 what's a thing?
01:42:48 What would you,
01:42:49 what's,
01:42:50 what kind of thing would happen in this scenario?
01:42:51 Blessed be the man who layeth his wife
01:42:54 upon a green grass,
01:42:56 only twice in the full moon,
01:42:58 and not three times,
01:42:59 for that would be too much for her,
01:43:01 you know,
01:43:02 womb.
01:43:03 Right.
01:43:04 Something,
01:43:04 yeah.
01:43:04 Something like this.
01:43:05 I made,
01:43:05 I made up a little parable about like a,
01:43:07 like a,
01:43:09 someone,
01:43:09 some,
01:43:10 a holy man coming on like a rich community,
01:43:12 with like the,
01:43:13 they like,
01:43:13 they favored like the,
01:43:15 the local authorities,
01:43:16 they favored like earthly authority over,
01:43:18 over the king of life.
01:43:20 Oh no, no, no, no.
01:43:21 And they were,
01:43:21 yeah,
01:43:22 and they got rich off of that,
01:43:23 but God smote them
01:43:24 because they had their fucking priorities
01:43:26 all mixed up.
01:43:26 Yeah.
01:43:26 Okay.
01:43:27 He's,
01:43:27 oh yeah,
01:43:28 he's smote him.
01:43:28 Oh,
01:43:28 he's smote him all right.
01:43:30 Demons are real,
01:43:30 so I guess God is definitely real.
01:43:33 Oh,
01:43:33 I should think so.
01:43:34 Mm hmm.
01:43:35 I,
01:43:35 I,
01:43:36 I wouldn't even question it.
01:43:37 Sounds fair to me.
01:43:39 It's a really,
01:43:39 it's a really weird system.
01:43:41 Like there's not like attack and defense.
01:43:42 You basically just take turns
01:43:44 doing shit.
01:43:46 And like your,
01:43:47 and like attack and defense are all like
01:43:49 rolled into one thing,
01:43:50 and there's just like huge dice pools,
01:43:52 and like every turn it's like,
01:43:54 you're bringing in,
01:43:54 you're bringing,
01:43:55 you choose,
01:43:56 you roll your initial dice,
01:43:57 and then the next turn it's like,
01:43:59 well,
01:43:59 oh,
01:44:00 I have a trait
01:44:01 where it's like,
01:44:02 you know,
01:44:03 I'm,
01:44:03 I'm,
01:44:04 you know,
01:44:04 I went to school,
01:44:06 my character has a trait that's like,
01:44:07 I went to engineering school
01:44:09 so I could run railroads
01:44:10 instead of build them like my parents did.
01:44:12 So like,
01:44:12 if there's like an engineering scenario,
01:44:14 I'll be like,
01:44:14 oh yeah,
01:44:15 I'll bring that trait in,
01:44:16 add some more dice.
01:44:17 Next turn,
01:44:17 someone shoots at me,
01:44:18 oh,
01:44:18 I pull my gun out
01:44:19 and shoot back at him.
01:44:20 Now I bring my guns dice into it, you know.
01:44:22 I'm just imagining
01:44:23 as the dice pool grows,
01:44:24 like you get to like a giant,
01:44:26 like there's a dark soul style giant lever,
01:44:28 you need to full,
01:44:28 a full body like pull,
01:44:30 which opens the door,
01:44:31 it's like a gigantic vat full of dice
01:44:33 that all begin rolling,
01:44:34 all at once.
01:44:36 That's,
01:44:36 that's the,
01:44:37 that's the,
01:44:37 that's the dream.
01:44:38 That,
01:44:38 that is the dream.
01:44:39 So many weapons.
01:44:40 You gotta unlock,
01:44:41 you gotta turn the key.
01:44:42 Oh shit.
01:44:43 That's what it was like
01:44:44 when they dropped the bomb on Hiroshima
01:44:46 for every individual person,
01:44:47 they had to take individual damage,
01:44:49 you know,
01:44:49 you know how it was,
01:44:50 or Dresden,
01:44:51 whatever,
01:44:51 it's all good.
01:44:52 When the bomb starts dropping,
01:44:53 and like the emperor,
01:44:54 and the dice start rolling.
01:44:55 It's like everyone roll initiative.
01:44:58 Shit.
01:45:01 Rat,
01:45:02 Ratcon for D&D campaign, dude.
01:45:05 Maybe.
01:45:06 Hey.
01:45:06 RFCK D&D campaign, dude.
01:45:10 Munchy.
01:45:10 Remember,
01:45:11 remember mice,
01:45:12 the convention?
01:45:13 Of course, of course.
01:45:14 Remember what you were thinking about?
01:45:15 Okay.
01:45:16 Well,
01:45:17 it's been less than a month
01:45:18 since the like table applications are open,
01:45:22 and they're already closed.
01:45:23 Oh, well.
01:45:24 What?
01:45:24 I checked it a little while.
01:45:26 Yeah, like I didn't,
01:45:27 I didn't think they'd be gone instantly.
01:45:30 They opened up in April,
01:45:31 and now it's May,
01:45:32 and yeah,
01:45:33 according to the website,
01:45:34 they're no longer taking applications,
01:45:36 so I'm very disappointed.
01:45:37 I mean, what were you waiting for?
01:45:39 Did you want to be in?
01:45:41 Yeah.
01:45:43 Me and,
01:45:43 me and Kazzy talked about it,
01:45:45 talked about getting the table together,
01:45:46 and I haven't talked to her about it,
01:45:48 but I kind of thought you were maybe
01:45:50 going to join in on this,
01:45:51 since you're like moving here.
01:45:52 No.
01:45:52 Well, I mean,
01:45:53 to get a table there?
01:45:54 I mean, I'm a comics artist,
01:45:56 so why would I?
01:45:57 No.
01:45:57 Oh, okay.
01:45:58 Well, I guess I should tell her.
01:45:59 Rest in peace, investigator.
01:46:01 We fucked up,
01:46:04 and that's all fucked now.
01:46:06 And I feel terrible about it.
01:46:08 It is life,
01:46:09 and it's all my fault.
01:46:10 You'll just know for next year, I guess.
01:46:12 I don't know if you want to.
01:46:14 There's more conventions.
01:46:17 I guess this one's really good,
01:46:19 and Casey Green was there,
01:46:20 and Abby Howard was there,
01:46:22 and I wanted to be on the other side.
01:46:24 I didn't want to go there
01:46:24 as a fucking consumer,
01:46:26 as a fucking sheep there
01:46:27 to spend money on this crap.
01:46:28 Should I get over it complex, dude?
01:46:30 I didn't.
01:46:31 It's terrible.
01:46:31 It's terrible.
01:46:32 I don't blame him.
01:46:33 I feel the same way.
01:46:33 I, too, am a man filled with pride
01:46:35 that is unwarranted, but, you know.
01:46:38 I'm literally not even going.
01:46:40 Like, I'm not even going.
01:46:41 Oh, man.
01:46:41 You just don't fucking see that way.
01:46:43 It was awful.
01:46:44 It was awful going there
01:46:45 as a fire expert.
01:46:45 No, you just got to take after Munch.
01:46:47 You got to go up to Casey Green
01:46:49 and ask him about the Smurfs 2 movie.
01:46:51 That's how you get it.
01:46:52 He'll let you on his podcast eventually.
01:46:54 Send him some pickup lines on his Tumblr
01:46:56 for, like, three months before the convention.
01:47:00 It's not impossible.
01:47:01 You're just talking about how
01:47:02 fucking celebrities aren't as mysterious
01:47:06 as they may seem.
01:47:07 Just fucking talk to him.
01:47:08 Just think at the end of the day,
01:47:09 he's just like Sargon of a Cod,
01:47:11 just a regular person.
01:47:13 Okay, here's what you do.
01:47:15 You go to conventions,
01:47:16 and you see about how no one pays attention to you.
01:47:19 And then you go to fucking whatever,
01:47:21 the round table, and you're like,
01:47:22 oh, I just won't tell anyone that I'm a comics artist.
01:47:25 I just won't let them know
01:47:26 about my many, many feats.
01:47:27 It should be implied by my very presence.
01:47:29 Yeah.
01:47:30 You got to be more...
01:47:31 Oh, I'll eat too much credit.
01:47:32 You can't be so fucking sad
01:47:35 that you aren't telling anyone
01:47:36 about how great you are.
01:47:37 Just let them know.
01:47:37 Well, if you had a bad time...
01:47:38 I'm not sad.
01:47:40 I'm just...
01:47:42 Also, I won't be going to that for a while
01:47:43 because I broke my toe yesterday.
01:47:44 Oh, no.
01:47:46 How'd you do that?
01:47:46 Again?
01:47:47 This is a partnership.
01:47:47 Yeah, with same toe.
01:47:49 Oh, no.
01:47:49 I just...
01:47:50 With same toe?
01:47:52 Yeah, I just stubbed it really hard into a door
01:47:54 as I was walking through,
01:47:55 and I instantly was like,
01:47:56 that's definitely...
01:47:57 Mistake after mistake.
01:47:58 Ben, I would highly recommend just
01:48:00 tilting your field of view
01:48:02 like five degrees lower at all times.
01:48:04 Do you wear slippers?
01:48:05 Look lower.
01:48:07 No, I don't wear slippers.
01:48:07 I think you should.
01:48:09 It's too hot.
01:48:10 It's too hot to wear slippers.
01:48:11 It is getting warm out.
01:48:12 Okay.
01:48:13 I cannot resonate with what just
01:48:14 has happened at all.
01:48:16 So you were walking so fucking hard
01:48:20 into your door that you stubbed it?
01:48:22 I was just walking at a norm.
01:48:24 I went to my door.
01:48:25 I opened the door.
01:48:26 I kind of simultaneously was opening the door
01:48:29 as I was taking a step with my foot
01:48:32 like to walk through it,
01:48:32 and the foot and the door just collided
01:48:35 in the cross section with enough force.
01:48:37 But it broke your toe?
01:48:39 You going to the doctor or anything?
01:48:40 Did you already go?
01:48:41 I'm in bunchy.
01:48:41 Remember last time he broke it just by like
01:48:43 walking into a room and he was running at the time.
01:48:45 I don't remember last time
01:48:46 because I wasn't there in that house.
01:48:47 I'm feeling discomfort.
01:48:48 I was moving at a slightly faster than walk.
01:48:52 I'm no, I'm not going to the doctor
01:48:53 because every time I've broken my toe,
01:48:55 I've just gone to the doctor.
01:48:56 They've just been like, well, you can tape it.
01:48:58 Yeah. Okay. Fair enough. Fair enough.
01:49:00 And I'm just like, I mean, I can still walk.
01:49:02 Yeah.
01:49:03 I mean, it hurts a little bit
01:49:04 and I'm trying not to walk too much.
01:49:06 But like, you know, I can still walk.
01:49:07 I'm not like crippled.
01:49:09 I just, I don't know.
01:49:10 It probably in like a week or two,
01:49:11 I won't even feel it anymore.
01:49:12 And it'll be like, it didn't even happen.
01:49:14 Well, all right.
01:49:16 Well, I'm glad that the one PCB member
01:49:19 that has an issue related to their feet and legs
01:49:21 is going to be, you know, healed up real soon.
01:49:24 Good job, Ben. You know, good job.
01:49:26 Yep. Don't worry, everyone. I'm fine.
01:49:28 You know what? Everything's great.
01:49:30 Guys, can we all just give it a round of applause
01:49:32 for this, for our state of physical health?
01:49:36 I feel good. I'm brave. It's true.
01:49:39 Hey, I'm a brave boy.
01:49:40 We were talking before.
01:49:41 I have one thing I wanted to bring up.
01:49:43 We spoke briefly about access journalism,
01:49:46 kind of, not really.
01:49:49 I don't know what, I've never,
01:49:50 I've never heard that phrase before.
01:49:51 Well, okay. That is a phrase.
01:49:52 I'm joking.
01:49:53 What are we talking about?
01:49:54 I just woke up.
01:49:56 Like talking to celebrities or whatever.
01:49:58 Okay. Well, here's my point.
01:50:00 Here's my point.
01:50:01 So I just hit 100,000 subs and that's cool.
01:50:04 Congratulations.
01:50:05 Now that I did that.
01:50:06 Oh, yes. Thank you. Thank you.
01:50:07 Now it's time to have a pro Jared style fallout.
01:50:09 Oh my God.
01:50:11 Cheat on the PCP with the pizza party podcast.
01:50:13 I've been here since 100,000 subs.
01:50:15 Can't wait for 90,000.
01:50:17 Can't wait for 80,000.
01:50:18 Looking forward to it.
01:50:21 I'm, I'm, what was I fucking saying?
01:50:24 Oh, right. Okay.
01:50:25 So, so I was talking to the gaming Brit the other day,
01:50:27 just passing.
01:50:28 And I was like, yeah.
01:50:29 He was like, hey, congrats.
01:50:30 He's like, you getting your silver play button?
01:50:32 I was like, you know, I, I don't know.
01:50:33 I've been waiting for like,
01:50:34 there's supposed to be like a prompt for that or something
01:50:36 and like the thing I don't know what to do.
01:50:37 He's like, why don't you just message like support?
01:50:40 I was like, wait, you can do that?
01:50:41 He was like, yeah, just like Google, you know,
01:50:43 fucking support.
01:50:44 And this is what he had to do to get his or something.
01:50:47 And they'll hook you up.
01:50:48 And so I was like, oh, okay.
01:50:50 Now apparently, this is a support.
01:50:51 Let me know if this works because if it does,
01:50:53 I have, it's been fucking four years
01:50:56 and that prompt never came.
01:50:58 Did you, okay.
01:50:59 Did you, did you ever?
01:51:00 Cause I have done this now.
01:51:01 So first of all, I am now verified on Twitter.
01:51:04 Cause I, sorry, not Twitter on, on YouTube.
01:51:06 Cause I reached out to the people on this help thing.
01:51:09 And there was a lady.
01:51:10 I think this is only available once you have a hundred
01:51:12 thousand subs.
01:51:12 I think is literally the cutoff point.
01:51:15 But once you have it, I just reached out
01:51:17 and I just sent him messages like,
01:51:19 Hey, I'm the, you know, best care for this is my channel.
01:51:21 Like I've got two issues.
01:51:22 One, I was hoping I could get verified.
01:51:23 Let me know what I have to do for that.
01:51:25 And two, dude, you got that, you got that check mark.
01:51:27 I look right now in the fucking thing.
01:51:30 It's a great check mark.
01:51:31 It's a great check mark.
01:51:32 I know it's not blue on YouTube.
01:51:33 Look in the gross discussing audio links.
01:51:35 There it is.
01:51:36 There's my check mark.
01:51:37 So I, so I like, that doesn't mean anything
01:51:40 other than that.
01:51:41 I'm like the real me, I guess.
01:51:42 Like Sargon says all the time, you're now a shill
01:51:43 and I can't trust you.
01:51:44 Well that, that's on Twitter.
01:51:46 It's very different on Twitter versus YouTube.
01:51:48 It's a very different situation.
01:51:49 Yeah.
01:51:49 What I, I've actually tried to get verified on Twitter
01:51:52 and I just found out they are not accepting
01:51:54 applications for Twitter verification.
01:51:56 So I don't think there is even a path anymore
01:51:59 to Twitter verification of any kind.
01:52:01 God, what's young Venus going to do?
01:52:03 I know, I know, he never did it.
01:52:06 Oh God, our dream has been shattered.
01:52:09 Oh, no one tell him.
01:52:10 I think what you need to tell him.
01:52:11 No one tell him.
01:52:11 He still hasn't verified Satan and I.
01:52:13 There's still a path.
01:52:14 You just become a journalist for some like
01:52:17 big old world publication is what you do.
01:52:20 And I think you will get verified.
01:52:22 I just don't think there's like a process
01:52:23 for the average person to get there anyway.
01:52:25 Okay, but, but on the subject of the silver play button,
01:52:28 so did you tell me if you've ever gotten this?
01:52:29 Cause like she said, like I was talking to this lady
01:52:31 and I'm like, hey, help me, you know,
01:52:32 verify and then silver play button.
01:52:34 She's like, oh yeah, no problem.
01:52:35 Like I'll send you an email in a little bit.
01:52:37 What she sent me is an email with a voucher code
01:52:40 and a link to like go here, put in this voucher code.
01:52:43 It prompts a window.
01:52:45 It says like type of your name or it said best guy,
01:52:47 but you can change it.
01:52:48 I just left it best guy ever.
01:52:49 And boom, hit okay.
01:52:51 We're now currently processing
01:52:52 your silver play button order.
01:52:54 It will be there in like, you know,
01:52:56 a couple of weeks or whatever.
01:52:57 So I think it's done.
01:52:59 It's on its way.
01:52:59 I think I need to go.
01:53:00 Amazing.
01:53:01 Gower, cause the email that I will help you do
01:53:03 is the same way Brent helped me.
01:53:06 I've only checked it like twice ever,
01:53:09 which is when my channel got taken down
01:53:10 to figure out why and what to do about it.
01:53:13 So it could possibly be buried in my email somewhere
01:53:17 ages ago.
01:53:18 I'll show you exactly what was sent to me.
01:53:19 But even beyond that,
01:53:20 I will give you exactly what fucking notification thing
01:53:24 I found and I just messaged her and said,
01:53:26 Hey, I want a thing.
01:53:27 They're like, no problem.
01:53:28 We'll do immediately.
01:53:29 Nope.
01:53:30 Done, done.
01:53:31 Yeah.
01:53:31 And it takes a long time for it to actually process as well.
01:53:35 Well, that very well may be the case,
01:53:36 but like it is underway now.
01:53:38 It wasn't before and now it is.
01:53:39 So I'm, I'm feeling pretty, pretty chuffed about that.
01:53:43 So yeah.
01:53:43 Oh, and the point I wanted to make about that was like,
01:53:45 okay, that's all well and good.
01:53:47 But like, you know, like a months ago,
01:53:49 my boy, a lobster boy,
01:53:50 Tyrar A. Dewey, ASMR guy, he, um, no.
01:53:55 It's just that he reached 100,000 subs like a while ago.
01:53:58 He's like 125,000 or whatever.
01:53:59 And like he made a video or whatever
01:54:01 and just said that like once he hit 100,000,
01:54:04 life was just so much better.
01:54:05 Like they were so nice and they were so helpful
01:54:08 in like the chat thing.
01:54:09 And this is the thing is I never even once attempted
01:54:13 to reach out to YouTube before I hit 100,000 subs.
01:54:16 So I have no basis for comparison,
01:54:18 but based on my experience now,
01:54:20 it's basically been great.
01:54:22 It's been super great.
01:54:22 It's an, it's like an unwritten thing,
01:54:25 but I think everybody understands that when you hit 100K,
01:54:28 you are just treated in some way differently by the system.
01:54:31 And like generally when people hit 100K,
01:54:35 the next couple 10,000 subs come way easier.
01:54:39 Yeah.
01:54:40 Yeah, that does, it always seems to happen.
01:54:42 And that's certainly my plan.
01:54:43 I mean there's like tiers of YouTube, obviously.
01:54:45 100K is one, when you hit a million,
01:54:47 you go like super fucking pro and then like you're a god.
01:54:50 Is that just, is that just from people that see that number?
01:54:52 No, I think it changed the way that the system treats you entirely.
01:54:56 Because it's where they take you seriously
01:54:58 as a YouTuber basically.
01:55:00 I had to fucking-
01:55:00 Because you're actually making them decent money now.
01:55:02 I am busting for a shit.
01:55:04 So nobody addressed me for the next few minutes.
01:55:07 Okay, you got it, dog.
01:55:08 And the only other thing about that is,
01:55:11 I think, did you said it's like implicit?
01:55:13 It's like not specified?
01:55:14 I think it is in fact 100% articulated,
01:55:16 at least parts of it, that you just,
01:55:18 at the very least you just don't have access
01:55:21 to the support staff until you hit 100,000 subs.
01:55:25 And once you do, then you do.
01:55:27 Then they will talk to you.
01:55:28 I want, I am games to hit 100,000,
01:55:30 so I can just like talk to somebody in real life
01:55:32 and just shit on them.
01:55:33 Be like, I fucking hate your company so much.
01:55:35 The only problem is-
01:55:35 It's great that I can finally talk to someone about it.
01:55:37 The only problem is,
01:55:38 you're just dealing with outsourced IT people who,
01:55:40 you know, they're not making any decisions at all.
01:55:42 It's the closest thing I'm ever gonna get
01:55:43 to Wajiski yourself,
01:55:44 so I'll take what I can get at that point.
01:55:46 I guess, but you know, honestly,
01:55:47 I was in a Digi's podcast,
01:55:50 the Whirling Dervish podcast the other day.
01:55:53 And I was just thinking,
01:55:54 I still resonate with his attitude
01:55:56 to why he's not here to hear this praise,
01:55:57 but it was just like people who have issues with YouTube,
01:56:03 it's just like, I mean, adapt and overcome.
01:56:05 I mean, you know, every job has issues.
01:56:07 The particular ones on YouTube are-
01:56:08 Of course you have to adapt or overcome.
01:56:10 That doesn't mean you have to be happy about it.
01:56:11 Oh, that's fair.
01:56:12 That's fair, I suppose.
01:56:15 I am sure this was discussed in the last episode,
01:56:18 since it's obviously the talk of the town,
01:56:20 at least in my closed off cave-like home,
01:56:24 and never leaving the town.
01:56:25 I assume that is the talk of the town.
01:56:27 I mean, after the two, still ongoing,
01:56:29 you were working on it just before the show, in fact.
01:56:30 Oh, that's true.
01:56:31 I had just finished filming,
01:56:32 and we'll finish after one.
01:56:33 You've only got like 10 more, 11 more videos to go.
01:56:36 Yeah, pretty much.
01:56:37 Pretty much.
01:56:37 At the time of recording.
01:56:38 The worst of it is over now, at least I assume so.
01:56:42 It's downhill for sure.
01:56:43 It's downhill for sure.
01:56:45 So now, looking back, I'm on your channel right now,
01:56:48 and the most viewed, which I don't know
01:56:51 if that's the measure of success here,
01:56:53 but if it is, then the best video is
01:56:55 Weaponized Thickness, Anatomy of a Meme.
01:56:58 That is number one.
01:56:59 It's true.
01:57:01 Close behind, well, not close behind it,
01:57:04 but just relatively big videos are, you know,
01:57:06 the Final Fantasy VII video, the hockey rant,
01:57:10 and the fairy tale is still dead video.
01:57:13 Now, that fairy tale one's only been out for three days,
01:57:16 but I think that will be cemented as either number one in time
01:57:20 or number two beyond the Weaponized Thickness one,
01:57:23 which, by the way, that Weaponized Thickness,
01:57:25 I think it only stands on the fact that once again,
01:57:27 I just put Galco in the thumbnail.
01:57:29 I'm pretty sure that's like 99% of why anyone cares,
01:57:32 and I guess the meme is known to some people,
01:57:34 so I suppose, but.
01:57:36 Now, obviously, you would know better than anyone.
01:57:39 I want to know currently how this Meme math
01:57:42 of a specifically success-wise compares to the first one.
01:57:48 I have no reference point for these numbers here.
01:57:51 I have no reference for if 10K being the standard
01:57:55 or like, you know, the high to low teens
01:57:58 being the standard of view rate.
01:57:59 Is that normal?
01:58:00 Is that good?
01:58:01 Is that fine?
01:58:02 Is that great or is that bad?
01:58:04 Compared to my, like, the generally released videos I do,
01:58:07 like, 10K for a video is quite low,
01:58:11 but the thing is, like, these are made very fast,
01:58:14 and 10K in one day to then produce the next day,
01:58:18 a 10K video and so on is, I mean, it's for my channel
01:58:23 and for my, you know, track record is great.
01:58:26 It's, I mean, this will absolutely be like a huge spike
01:58:30 in both viewership and, you know, AdSense earnings and stuff,
01:58:33 just for all the actual views that I'm accumulating,
01:58:36 just from all the fucking videos.
01:58:37 The cost I'm paying, however, is almost,
01:58:40 not to mention many videos, like the Thibidus,
01:58:42 some are like 20K, 30K, et cetera,
01:58:44 but the cost I am paying is absolutely.
01:58:47 I am losing subs.
01:58:48 I am 100% losing subs as a result of this,
01:58:52 but, however, the funny thing is,
01:58:54 now we'll get to comparing it to the original Miamafa,
01:58:58 is just that, like, I think that,
01:59:00 so right before this started, on day zero when I announced,
01:59:03 I'm gonna be doing YouTube full time, Miamafa 2, go.
01:59:07 I got, like, a thousand and a half subs or something,
01:59:11 and so a lot of those was because
01:59:12 Monkey shouted me out on Twitter,
01:59:14 and a couple other people, too.
01:59:16 I can't remember, everybody.
01:59:18 And that gave me a huge spike in subs for that day,
01:59:21 but then I've definitely been losing some,
01:59:24 and it's hard to know if it's those people
01:59:25 who were just only there, you know,
01:59:28 because they were told to be,
01:59:29 which frankly I don't even want.
01:59:30 I don't even, I'm happy to have people's,
01:59:33 you know, pity subs or whatever,
01:59:35 but ultimately it's basically worthless currency
01:59:37 in my humble opinion.
01:59:39 So I want much more organic accrual of views or whatever.
01:59:42 But anyway, point being that it's hard to tell
01:59:45 if this loss is just those exact same people
01:59:48 being like, eh, whatever,
01:59:49 or if it's legitimately followers
01:59:51 who've been accrued over time who are saying to themselves,
01:59:53 yeah, I've seen enough here.
01:59:54 He's really spamming me.
01:59:55 I'll come back after Miamafa.
01:59:57 Now in either case, I am not at all upset about,
02:00:01 I'm losing, like, maybe like 30 to 40 subs a day,
02:00:03 maybe 50 sometimes,
02:00:05 and I don't even think that if that rate continues,
02:00:07 I'll be below 100,000 by the end of Miamafa.
02:00:10 I think I'll be a-okay.
02:00:13 But I mean, in the question of is it worth it?
02:00:15 I mean, 100%.
02:00:17 Subs only exist to facilitate viewership anyway.
02:00:20 So frankly, the only thing I'm feeling
02:00:22 is I feel a bit of an ego attachment
02:00:24 to being over 100,000 and dipping back below
02:00:27 would be a somewhat of a blow to my ego.
02:00:30 But then, I mean, you know,
02:00:31 you obviously can't operate with that.
02:00:33 It's your primary motivation.
02:00:34 So, you know, fuck it, I've already committed.
02:00:37 I mean, if you're losing 30 a day,
02:00:38 you would have to go, that would be 20 more days.
02:00:40 Maybe more like 50 to be a little harsher.
02:00:43 I could dip back under at the end.
02:00:45 It's possible.
02:00:48 Yeah, yeah.
02:00:50 So, you know, but that doesn't really matter.
02:00:53 The net gain far, far outstrips the net loss.
02:00:56 And again, this is only going on for like 12 more days,
02:00:59 and then it's over.
02:01:00 So, you know, whatever, man.
02:01:03 Have, is this behalf of a easier or harder than the last one?
02:01:08 Well, it is harder in some ways and easier in others.
02:01:15 So, I'm working only, I'm working more than half time,
02:01:18 but like, I don't know,
02:01:19 I'm working a little bit less at my day job.
02:01:21 But the thing is, I now have a dog and a girlfriend
02:01:25 who both live with me.
02:01:26 And that, just that, that reality of driving her to work
02:01:29 and doing a bunch of other stuff
02:01:30 does take up some amount of time.
02:01:32 So, well, I gotta like walk him every once in a while and shit,
02:01:36 you know, so, like, to be distracted,
02:01:38 the other Miamafa was like a pure, just me,
02:01:42 do shit, no distractions, nothing else matters.
02:01:45 But I'm not in that exact same position now.
02:01:48 So, I've got no choice,
02:01:49 but to kind of do things every once in a while.
02:01:51 Now, it's fine, it's not a big deal.
02:01:54 I've got a little extra time.
02:01:54 Just slid out a darker, browner version of the exact Popeyes
02:01:58 four piece I ate yesterday.
02:02:01 Fascinating.
02:02:01 It's much, much spicier on the other end
02:02:04 than it was going into the mouth.
02:02:06 Tell me I'm not.
02:02:07 Great.
02:02:07 You are a criminal.
02:02:09 How interesting.
02:02:10 Okay, finish at my point,
02:02:11 because I've been talking about this too long.
02:02:11 Popeyes also sucks, by the way.
02:02:14 They're not great.
02:02:15 They're not great.
02:02:15 I went to Red Lobster, no, not really.
02:02:16 Yeah, I went to Red Lobster the other day.
02:02:18 I was looking for an inky mageage.
02:02:19 She wasn't there, but it was great.
02:02:21 It was delicious.
02:02:22 Love is lobster sucks.
02:02:23 It wants you to think that it's not.
02:02:24 Cheddar biscuits, Munchie.
02:02:26 Cheddar biscuits.
02:02:27 Man, fucking get that shit in a fucking box of bombs.
02:02:30 If you go into a restaurant for cheddar biscuits,
02:02:32 it's not a good restaurant.
02:02:33 Well, people go to Olive Garden for the breadsticks.
02:02:35 Exactly, case and fucking point.
02:02:38 Yeah.
02:02:38 All right, fair enough.
02:02:40 I'm not a high-brow man.
02:02:42 Me and my friend Lorenz.
02:02:45 Me and my friend Lorenz,
02:02:46 the guy who is running the dogs-
02:02:48 Oh, wait, fuck you, Munchie.
02:02:49 I took my parents out when they visited
02:02:50 to the nicest restaurant in Cincinnati
02:02:53 when they were here.
02:02:54 So you don't know, you've never even seen.
02:02:56 I want my fucking good boy boys with a weird monster.
02:02:56 You have never seen the kind of quality.
02:02:59 Oh, I want a great chocolate cheese
02:03:01 and get the fucking gummies for 3,000 points away.
02:03:04 I'm not a high-brow.
02:03:05 Munchie, at this fucking restaurant,
02:03:07 you order your entree, entree two and entree three
02:03:12 and dessert and salad at the beginning of the thing.
02:03:16 It's a whole- Lorenz, you better-
02:03:17 Your pea brain cannot imagine the level of cuisine
02:03:20 I have obtained in my life now.
02:03:22 But what about the service?
02:03:23 I can imagine.
02:03:24 Fantastic.
02:03:24 Incredible, man.
02:03:25 Also, to agree to that restaurant
02:03:27 because he was trying to court me, I think.
02:03:29 Oh, actually, Digi.
02:03:30 Actually, the precinct is one of the top restaurants
02:03:33 in the city.
02:03:34 That is not the top restaurant
02:03:36 where I took my family later.
02:03:38 That was my first thought.
02:03:39 But we went one step above to this place called...
02:03:42 Fuck, what's it called?
02:03:43 It's like the Lotus.
02:03:44 I can't even imagine the hotel.
02:03:46 Because that was the nicest restaurant I've ever eaten at.
02:03:48 I know, but I've found a way to go even further
02:03:51 beyond Super Saiyan 3 style.
02:03:52 And it's incredible.
02:03:53 The food looks like an entree over $100
02:03:56 for just like the one item.
02:03:58 This... the meal was many hundreds of dollars
02:04:01 for four of us.
02:04:02 Damn.
02:04:02 It was...
02:04:04 Yeah.
02:04:06 Not last New Year's, but the years before that,
02:04:10 I went out to a fancy steakhouse with the Kazi.
02:04:15 And I was... I basically just was like,
02:04:18 what, unprepared for like what fancy restaurants
02:04:20 actually entailed?
02:04:21 Yeah, it was crazy.
02:04:21 Because obviously I looked at the menu
02:04:23 and I saw the price and I thought,
02:04:24 OK, this will be a lot of money,
02:04:25 but that's OK.
02:04:26 Because, you know, it's a special occasion.
02:04:29 And so we go out, but I don't realize
02:04:31 that like you are like forced to buy like an entree
02:04:36 and then another entree and then an appetizer.
02:04:38 And like you are forced to buy all this other stuff.
02:04:40 Kind of.
02:04:40 Because the seats are so expensive
02:04:42 that they are losing money if you don't buy all of them.
02:04:45 So it was a...
02:04:45 True, true.
02:04:46 Like literally, I'm not saying that like you were forced to like,
02:04:49 you know, it was incentivized to.
02:04:50 I mean, like literally they said,
02:04:51 unless you buy all these things, you can't sit here.
02:04:54 That's crazy.
02:04:55 Because it's New Year's.
02:04:55 That's not how the 1B and 8B went to work.
02:04:58 No, they're a little more cashed that place, the precinct.
02:05:00 Well, well, anyway, in any case, that's how it was there.
02:05:02 So we finagle the situation where we would sit at the bar
02:05:06 and just pretend that we're 21 and then get an entree there
02:05:09 and only the entree.
02:05:10 So the entree was expensive, but you know, it was worth it.
02:05:13 But if we had been normal,
02:05:16 then it would have been like cut ruple as much
02:05:18 to get all the extra bullshit.
02:05:20 So fair enough.
02:05:20 It's a scary life.
02:05:21 It's a scary life out there dining.
02:05:23 All right.
02:05:24 This is all heresy.
02:05:25 Me and Lorenz, as I was starting to say before,
02:05:28 we have pooled our expertise.
02:05:31 And we are making, we are starting a keto cooking collaboration.
02:05:35 Our next project.
02:05:35 Oh, sorry, Ben.
02:05:36 I just want to say the restaurant, Orchids at Palm Court Reservations.
02:05:40 Orchids at Palm Court.
02:05:41 OK, sorry.
02:05:42 Sorry.
02:05:42 It's the best place.
02:05:43 Look it up.
02:05:43 Keto donuts.
02:05:44 Keto donuts.
02:05:46 All different flavors.
02:05:47 We're going to make them fruit flavor.
02:05:48 We're going to make cinnamon.
02:05:50 We're going to make them vanilla.
02:05:51 We're going to make them chocolate.
02:05:52 We're going to go fucking nuts.
02:05:53 We're going to fry them.
02:05:54 It's going to be, it's a miracle.
02:05:56 We're collecting all our ingredients.
02:05:58 Good.
02:05:59 You're collecting all the necessary objects required for this endeavor.
02:06:03 And I am so excited.
02:06:05 Again, Ben, different philosophy at the beginning
02:06:07 and different execution, but the end results of both of our lives
02:06:12 are also delicious meals currently.
02:06:14 And I'm very enamored with what you're doing currently.
02:06:17 And I would love you to say, Ben,
02:06:19 is much excruciating detail about these donuts as you could possibly.
02:06:21 What are the ingredients for a keto donut?
02:06:24 Okay. Well, there's a big, there's a big ideological divide.
02:06:28 Lorenz is convinced that we need to go the almond flour route.
02:06:31 And I believe that coconut flour is the way to go.
02:06:34 So we're going to, we're going to experiment with each.
02:06:37 We're going to maybe do a half and half version.
02:06:39 I've ordered xanthan gum to add to the, xanthan gum to hopefully give it
02:06:44 like a more like sticky, like actual doughy consistency.
02:06:47 So they'll hold their ring shape when they're dropped in the oil.
02:06:50 There's also an ideological divide between baking and frying.
02:06:52 I think that if it's not fried, a donut is not a donut.
02:06:56 It's just a, it's just a circular cake.
02:06:59 There is, there is the possibility,
02:07:00 there is the possibility of a, of a sugar-free jelly filling
02:07:05 that might be, that might be stripping towards at some point.
02:07:10 Mine, mine too, mine too.
02:07:12 There's a possibility of making a, of making a sugar-free
02:07:15 version variant of the Boston cream, of the Boston cream.
02:07:18 I'm very interested in this Ben, because I'm back on keto,
02:07:21 started two days ago, and I'm, I'm invested in the narrative now.
02:07:26 Watch out, Tom, because there's a lot of keto-delito going on these days.
02:07:30 I know, I know, I know.
02:07:31 I gotta, I'm staying on my toes.
02:07:32 There's a lot of kidney stones.
02:07:33 We're, we're a person, we're a persecuted people.
02:07:35 I'm like kidding.
02:07:36 I'm staying on my key toes as it is.
02:07:38 Oh, there you go.
02:07:38 Make sure I don't get deleted.
02:07:39 Oh, too bad I can't, because I fucking broke one.
02:07:42 That's the first part of the deletion, dude.
02:07:44 You gotta be careful.
02:07:45 I flipped fucking out yesterday.
02:07:49 I was listening to a podcast, and someone completely unrelated to our,
02:07:53 to like anything diet related, mentioned being in ketosis.
02:07:58 And I just like, I was in the kitchen, I just flailed uncontrollably,
02:08:01 and like dropped all everything that I was working on,
02:08:04 and just had like a fucking seizure,
02:08:06 and ride on the floor for like an hour afterward.
02:08:08 So it reminded me of Ben saying-
02:08:09 You know, that sounds, that sounds, that sounds like a problem.
02:08:12 You know what I think would give you probably increased mental clarity and focus,
02:08:15 so that that kind of thing wouldn't happen?
02:08:18 Please, tell me more.
02:08:20 It's ketones, Munchie.
02:08:21 It's always ketones.
02:08:24 Tom, you should come, you should come over.
02:08:26 You should come, you should get in here and make keto donuts with Ben.
02:08:30 Yeah, it sounds actually fucking cool.
02:08:32 You know what I'm gonna do for you?
02:08:33 I'm gonna be in Boston.
02:08:34 Get over here to Monkey House.
02:08:35 Get over here to Monkey House.
02:08:36 I'm gonna be in Boston real soon.
02:08:37 I'm gonna try and find a keto recipe.
02:08:39 I want to exchange recipes, Ben.
02:08:41 I want to exchange recipes and dishes.
02:08:44 I'm gonna, I'm gonna figure out how to make a keto thing.
02:08:47 I've been making, I've been making keto cakes.
02:08:49 I'm gonna make keto cupcakes.
02:08:50 I've made keto, I've been making keto pizzas.
02:08:52 That's my new thing.
02:08:54 It is, it is a whole world.
02:08:55 It's a whole world of weird experimentation that I am just,
02:08:59 I was just going nuts with.
02:09:01 Think we should move two points now.
02:09:02 It's really fun.
02:09:03 Yeah, I guess we're at that time.
02:09:04 Okay, but before we do, I want to say I got something arrived in mail today.
02:09:09 I ordered like this little blanket to put over my shoulders
02:09:12 because my shoulders always get cold.
02:09:14 It can be like in the heat of the summer,
02:09:15 but if I don't have something on my shoulders,
02:09:17 I just feel uncomfortable.
02:09:18 And it's like the cutest, softest thing.
02:09:20 And I'm just so happy.
02:09:21 And I'm just like, I just, I shove my face in it
02:09:24 because it's just so soft.
02:09:26 How nice.
02:09:26 And I-
02:09:27 Mages, sounds like you need a cake.
02:09:28 It's from age.
02:09:29 New cake.
02:09:29 You need to put on a fucking shirt question mark.
02:09:32 No, why are you wearing a shirt?
02:09:34 I think you need, you need big world of Warcraft shoulder pads.
02:09:38 That's the answer.
02:09:39 Good idea.
02:09:39 For sure.
02:09:40 It's just, it just makes me so happy.
02:09:42 And I love it so much.
02:09:43 And I've been wearing it throughout the whole podcast.
02:09:45 And I just, I just, it's, I, I've been petting it
02:09:47 because it's just so soft.
02:09:48 It's so soft.
02:09:50 We got to put that in the shirt.
02:09:51 I, uh, I initially-
02:09:52 Mages, line us.
02:09:53 I initially heard I bought a little blind kid
02:09:56 to put on my-
02:09:57 Ha ha ha ha ha.
02:09:58 No, no, did you know?
02:10:01 Yeah, even, even, even Mages servant
02:10:04 can't see what she looks like.
02:10:05 Had to be a blind kid.
02:10:06 No.
02:10:08 But can he see why kids love the taste
02:10:10 of cinnamon toast crunch?
02:10:11 No, she can.
02:10:12 He's blind.
02:10:12 No.
02:10:13 I'm sorry.
02:10:14 He can see it with his mind's eye.
02:10:17 Well, hey, team, it feels like a good place
02:10:19 to transition to voicemails,
02:10:20 if I could say so myself.
02:10:21 Yeah, you can do it.
02:10:22 Munchy, do you have those prepared?
02:10:24 Indeed it does.
02:10:24 Of course I do.
02:10:26 I, speaking of cooking,
02:10:29 there is a productive teen
02:10:32 that would like to have a word with us
02:10:33 on that issue.
02:10:35 Just, you know.
02:10:36 Teenagers.
02:10:37 To, to, to continue it.
02:10:38 Let me go over to Techno.
02:10:40 Here we go.
02:10:41 I'm looking at the charts for anal circumference by the way.
02:10:43 Hey, what's up, PCP?
02:10:45 I am the productive teen, 17,
02:10:48 and I hear to tell you that I like
02:10:51 that you talk about food sometimes.
02:10:52 Yeah.
02:10:53 I'm a culinary student,
02:10:55 so that's pretty self-explanatory.
02:10:59 Keep up, keep talking about food.
02:11:00 Well, lucky you.
02:11:01 Well, just, done and done, done and done.
02:11:04 I just, I want to say someone in the comments
02:11:06 last episode said something about the teen CP,
02:11:10 but they didn't spell it T-E-E-N-C-P.
02:11:13 They spelled it teen-C-P.
02:11:15 What?
02:11:16 As in like teen-C-tiny.
02:11:18 The teen CP?
02:11:19 Yeah, the teen CP.
02:11:21 Well, teen CP is the son of Zoomer Joe,
02:11:24 as we all know.
02:11:25 As we all know.
02:11:25 Shout out to that guy.
02:11:26 I'm going to finally pull the trigger,
02:11:28 just because of that voicemail on a vlog
02:11:30 I've been meaning to do for a while called
02:11:32 How to Food,
02:11:33 an instructional guide to millennials on how to food.
02:11:38 I don't think that's interesting.
02:11:39 What's the general thesis here?
02:11:40 It sounds scary.
02:11:41 Just basically, if you want to eat food,
02:11:44 here's how you should do it.
02:11:46 You open your mouth, you put the food in.
02:11:48 Do you follow this advice or is this aspirational?
02:11:50 Yes.
02:11:50 No, it's advice I follow.
02:11:52 Okay, okay, cool, cool.
02:11:53 Well, give us the deeds, dude.
02:11:55 Don't fuck with me.
02:11:56 I'm going to make a video about Jesus.
02:11:57 He's going to make a vlog about it, god damn it.
02:11:58 No spoilers.
02:11:59 Oh, god.
02:12:00 Maybe, I hope, my hope is that I vehemently disagree
02:12:04 and I can make a response video,
02:12:06 calling you.
02:12:07 Oh, good idea.
02:12:07 No, man, you'll love it,
02:12:08 because I'm going to start off by ranting.
02:12:11 Like, I'm just going to, for no particular reason.
02:12:12 By entering ketosis live on camera.
02:12:17 For no reason other than to make it more clickbaity,
02:12:20 I will start off by just shitting on HelloFresh.
02:12:23 Hey, fair enough.
02:12:24 Yeah.
02:12:25 All right, well, that's exciting.
02:12:27 Nightmare.
02:12:28 Nightmare.
02:12:28 Capitalist nightmare.
02:12:30 God, I still like get like seething mad,
02:12:34 like opening my fridge, like thinking about food,
02:12:37 just thinking like, how is he so fucking stupid?
02:12:39 How does he not see?
02:12:40 How does he not understand?
02:12:44 And as stated last time we had this debate,
02:12:46 I don't even like HelloFresh.
02:12:49 I don't even like it.
02:12:50 You're supposed to be so mad that you don't like it vehemently.
02:12:53 Wait, speaking of food delivery services,
02:12:56 someone on Twitter added me in response to a picture
02:13:00 of Asterios Cocanos with Nathan fucking What's His Name
02:13:03 from Garfield Eats.
02:13:05 What?
02:13:06 Apparently Asterios brought up Garfield Eats on a podcast as well,
02:13:11 and he fucking met Nathan something.
02:13:14 I don't remember his last name,
02:13:16 but the guy with the tiny edited mouth.
02:13:17 God, our clout is pathetic.
02:13:19 We really need to get it up there.
02:13:21 We got to get the Garfield Eats guy on a PZP.
02:13:24 Imagine.
02:13:24 Whoa.
02:13:25 Imagine.
02:13:27 All right, all right.
02:13:27 Guys, well, Nate, I'm sorry, Ben, I just want to say
02:13:31 that you're a nightmare, and I hate you,
02:13:34 and I think that this person living under your brutal political regime
02:13:38 will agree with me.
02:13:39 This is Kill Ben.
02:13:40 Pain, misery, and more pain.
02:13:44 It's the year 2021 in the Ben St. Imperial Calendar,
02:13:47 month three, day 13.
02:13:49 After his kidney stone yielded many clones,
02:13:52 they proceeded to rape and pillage our lands.
02:13:55 Governments fell apart.
02:13:56 The world collapsed.
02:13:58 World order is in chaos.
02:13:59 We all live in shacks.
02:14:00 Me, my neighbors, everyone lives in shacks.
02:14:03 He sends his clones out twice a week to piss test everyone.
02:14:07 If you find someone not on keto, he takes a finger,
02:14:10 but he's really into the inter-agagement life.
02:14:13 So he tells you a knock, knock joke while he's taking your fingers.
02:14:16 Oh, but it's the same fucking knock, knock joke every single time.
02:14:20 He doesn't get any new material.
02:14:22 I was out looking for food scrounging the lands yesterday.
02:14:24 I came across a water fountain.
02:14:26 I think to myself, you know, water's keto friendly.
02:14:28 I get some fresh what?
02:14:29 No, no, more monster zero, more fucking monster zero.
02:14:32 He's always drinking bang energy.
02:14:34 We just get monster zero.
02:14:36 Nate, you should be the most worried.
02:14:38 After everything collapses, he takes your enterprises,
02:14:41 becomes best guy ever, locks you in a cell,
02:14:44 and you only get carbs.
02:14:45 And he laughs every time.
02:14:46 He loves it.
02:14:47 No, in my protein.
02:14:49 Destroy his kidney stones.
02:14:51 Kill Ben St.
02:14:52 Save the future.
02:14:54 Will do.
02:14:55 And with that, I would like you to direct you
02:14:58 to the link in the description to a free text.
02:14:59 You can play entirely with your superpower
02:15:01 and enlist fucking Rowdy.
02:15:03 Kill that piece of shit.
02:15:06 Ben St. in real life.
02:15:08 I am ordered a direct attack.
02:15:10 Ratties, no more video games.
02:15:12 Get a real gun in real life and shoot him in Boston, Massachusetts.
02:15:17 I beg you, please don't let this happen to you.
02:15:20 Do not let him take over the world.
02:15:21 Get fucking Rowdy.
02:15:23 Hey, Munchy.
02:15:24 Hey, Munchy.
02:15:24 So I'm not sure.
02:15:26 I could save this for RFCK on Wednesday.
02:15:29 If you can, you definitely should.
02:15:31 Okay, well...
02:15:32 You can give me a teaser, but don't spoil it or anything.
02:15:34 I sampled some new energy drink flavors.
02:15:38 Ooh, oh yeah, that's RFCK.
02:15:40 Okay, yeah.
02:15:41 All right, no more, no more, no more.
02:15:42 Hey, specifically...
02:15:43 Okay, I have a bunch to...
02:15:44 I have much to...
02:15:45 Before we start the next...
02:15:45 I do too, actually.
02:15:46 I do too.
02:15:47 Oh my god.
02:15:48 I'm just thinking about how there's those people
02:15:50 who are like the psychotic fans who think that
02:15:53 that they're being sent messages to kill the president in media.
02:15:57 And if Munchy had one of those fans,
02:15:59 it would not be secret messages.
02:16:01 They would just be like, oh, kill Ben St.
02:16:03 Okay.
02:16:04 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:16:06 Exactly.
02:16:07 Guys, Munchy, before you go on,
02:16:09 I've got a fascinating thing that just happened to me.
02:16:12 And it's just that on Twitter,
02:16:13 someone sent me a message of the kind that I've long dreaded
02:16:16 and I finally just got one.
02:16:18 This is a message from someone who's essentially saying
02:16:21 that they are disappointed with my newest video
02:16:23 about the One Piece manga, in effect.
02:16:25 It's about manga, but I talk about One Piece, of course.
02:16:27 He's disappointed because I'm so adamant
02:16:30 about reading manga solely through scan relations.
02:16:33 And if I really loved manga as much as I say I do,
02:16:36 I should support the industry
02:16:38 and should give this media their two dollars
02:16:41 to read it monthly or whatever.
02:16:43 One Piece is like a super mega corporation.
02:16:47 It's like it doesn't need any more money.
02:16:50 I mean, Oda is fresh beyond his fucking wildest imagination
02:16:54 and he's the only person in the machine of One Piece
02:16:58 who you should give any fuck about.
02:17:00 So at this point, it's like Oda's spoken for.
02:17:03 Anything else you're spending on it
02:17:04 is just going into the machine.
02:17:06 I mean, there's something to be said for...
02:17:09 I support the peons who help bring the manga to me weekly
02:17:14 in the magazines and whatnot.
02:17:15 I suppose.
02:17:16 But like, so that's all cool.
02:17:18 And I support the industry, I don't know,
02:17:21 like obviously I'm in favorite existing.
02:17:23 But like, I don't think this man's understanding
02:17:25 the context of me having read this series.
02:17:29 When I first started reading One Piece,
02:17:30 what was I supposed to read?
02:17:31 The non-existent English releases?
02:17:34 And now look, okay, maybe I'm behind the fucking times
02:17:36 and I should catch my moral compass up to the real world.
02:17:38 But I've made basically my entire One Piece career
02:17:42 has been in scan relations.
02:17:44 I'm ass deep in the scanlation world.
02:17:47 And I'll just say, I frankly just don't care that much.
02:17:50 I mean, that's totally true.
02:17:52 If I can save a buck by doing something for free,
02:17:54 I will absolutely do it.
02:17:56 I don't even fault you, dude.
02:17:57 I think your position is totally fine.
02:17:59 It's just that I just don't care.
02:18:00 That's my position.
02:18:02 All right, I mean, that's it.
02:18:03 I just thought that was interesting.
02:18:04 I've been expecting something like that for a long time,
02:18:07 or perhaps my rampant video game piracy,
02:18:10 or I don't know,
02:18:11 I stole Sony Vegas to make videos with all these things.
02:18:15 What, Nate, I understand that you're witnessing.
02:18:18 Boy, isn't it nice that content on the internet
02:18:22 is freely distributed
02:18:23 and not bound up in the hands of big corporations
02:18:27 and the people that have all the money?
02:18:29 Like, isn't it nice that these things
02:18:30 are just available to the public to be used freely
02:18:32 for the betterment of time?
02:18:33 I recognize, I am doing something wrong.
02:18:36 I simply accept my immorality.
02:18:38 That's how I feel about it.
02:18:39 I don't think it's necessarily wrong.
02:18:41 Nate, I understand that you enjoyed the first episode
02:18:43 of my Whirling Dervish podcast.
02:18:45 I did.
02:18:46 I was talking about it before.
02:18:47 I very much enjoyed, especially,
02:18:50 my favorite part was your,
02:18:51 just talking about how people who do YouTube
02:18:54 and then are overly critical of it
02:18:57 as if they have no control over being involved with it.
02:18:59 I was just kind of agreeing with that.
02:19:02 You'll enjoy the second episode
02:19:03 because I go on a long tirade about how physical media needs to die
02:19:08 and how supporting,
02:19:10 like, I don't want to support an industry
02:19:13 that gives me anything less than the best possible experience
02:19:17 because it's like,
02:19:18 I'm always going to choose the best experience.
02:19:20 If downloading Torrance is the best experience,
02:19:24 why would I pay for something worse
02:19:26 when they have the option to offer me something better?
02:19:29 Which is what, you know,
02:19:30 it's the classic game, Newell Piracy is a,
02:19:34 what was the service problem?
02:19:36 Service problem, yeah.
02:19:37 And, you know, to that point on this
02:19:38 Viz Media thing or, you know,
02:19:39 by paying for One Piece or whatever,
02:19:41 when it is literally infinitely easier
02:19:44 for me to just Google Read One Piece Online,
02:19:46 bam, there's MangaReader.
02:19:48 Like, I don't, oh, great.
02:19:49 I don't have to like sign in or give money to someone.
02:19:51 I would, yeah, I'd argue, again,
02:19:53 this is a service problem.
02:19:54 I know Gabe's kind of shifted on that
02:19:56 over the years, I guess, but.
02:19:57 Imagine if you typed into Google Read One Piece Online,
02:20:00 the first result was Viz.
02:20:02 You clicked on it and you read it right there
02:20:04 and at the bottom of the page,
02:20:05 there was just a fucking tip jar
02:20:07 and it's like, it just says, like,
02:20:08 click this button if you loved this chapter
02:20:11 to donate a dollar to, you know, to it.
02:20:15 And then you just, like, people would just do it
02:20:17 because they're like, oh, this chapter was great, click,
02:20:19 you know?
02:20:20 Now, considering my own, would I ever, ever click that?
02:20:24 The answer is no, I will never click that button
02:20:26 to give money I don't have to, but other people will,
02:20:28 but other people will.
02:20:29 I would be surprised if you never had a moment
02:20:32 where you read a chapter and you were just so excited
02:20:34 and the button was right fucking there
02:20:37 I mean, maybe, if I knew it was like going to Oda
02:20:39 or like the editor, whoever,
02:20:41 the people actually making the product.
02:20:42 You guys are witnessing the fall of Titans right now.
02:20:45 Ben St. obliterated, literally killed, hopefully.
02:20:48 Yeah.
02:20:48 Nate, his moral compass shattered.
02:20:51 Shattered, yeah.
02:20:51 He obliterated.
02:20:52 And now the third in this building trilogy,
02:20:55 Tommy Oliver.
02:20:57 This next tape has only one track.
02:21:01 I'm gonna write it all the way to the Poly Station.
02:21:04 Oh, it's been too long, hasn't it, Tom?
02:21:10 Percy?
02:21:12 Percy?
02:21:13 Yes?
02:21:15 Have you seen Thomas?
02:21:17 He's late with his shipment.
02:21:19 Oh, oh, no, your grace.
02:21:22 In fact, I heard he drove off a cliff.
02:21:25 Suicide, eh?
02:21:27 The butt controller scratched his toby belly.
02:21:31 I suppose it was only a matter of time.
02:21:34 You'll have to work double shift to make up for his absence.
02:21:39 Well, uh, you see about that, sir, I...
02:21:43 What is it, Percy?
02:21:45 What's the matter?
02:21:46 The fat controller leaned in and Percy whispered.
02:21:51 Well, I, uh, I suppose I'm a conch.
02:22:00 The station's empty.
02:22:02 I thought you would be here, Tom.
02:22:07 I long for the touch of your feminine fingernails on my back.
02:22:14 I guess there is no manicure for depression.
02:22:23 Wow.
02:22:25 Okay.
02:22:25 That was a journey.
02:22:26 Holy shit.
02:22:26 Oh, the fuck was that?
02:22:28 I just went on a journey.
02:22:29 It's, it's, it's a fourth loss tape.
02:22:31 This is the fourth loss tape.
02:22:33 Incredible.
02:22:34 Center around Tom, obviously.
02:22:37 Would you like to explain what has happened here, Tom?
02:22:39 Because obviously you would know better than anyone.
02:22:42 Um, I, I...
02:22:43 Would he?
02:22:44 I don't even know.
02:22:45 I just, I just went on a journey there.
02:22:47 Uh, I guess...
02:22:49 I mean, I mean, we're hearing these voices,
02:22:51 voices from your past, I assume,
02:22:52 or were you a train conductor of some sort?
02:22:54 Did you have an associate with a blue in some way?
02:22:56 I mean, back, back in, back in the day, I...
02:22:57 I think he was a train.
02:22:58 Back in the day.
02:22:58 I was all about that shining time station.
02:23:00 Maybe I'm just an actual projection
02:23:02 of Thomas the Tank Engine all this time.
02:23:05 Yeah, probably.
02:23:06 Probably.
02:23:06 I legitimately couldn't tell if that was a clip
02:23:08 from an old show at first.
02:23:10 I mean, parts of it were...
02:23:11 So well produced and acted.
02:23:13 No, I don't think it was, dude.
02:23:14 I think it was all good.
02:23:14 No, I think that was just...
02:23:15 The acting on Percy's accent.
02:23:17 And I mean, the fat controller.
02:23:19 Incredible.
02:23:20 Incredible.
02:23:20 No.
02:23:21 Uh, I, uh, there's a new storyteller video
02:23:24 after this episode goes up.
02:23:26 It's just a face reveal.
02:23:28 It's Tom this entire time.
02:23:30 Oh, are you saying that that was supposed to be a video
02:23:33 by the new storyteller?
02:23:34 Is that what was going on there?
02:23:35 Well, no, that was a hidden...
02:23:37 Well, I mean, for, for all intents and purposes,
02:23:39 it could be.
02:23:40 Okay.
02:23:40 We don't know.
02:23:40 I mean, it's a lost tape.
02:23:41 The Lost Tape Archive, he finds ancient secret tapes
02:23:44 recorded by us exposing our histories.
02:23:46 Okay.
02:23:47 And in this one, in this ancient tomb.
02:23:48 So, I mean, if Tom is indeed the new storyteller,
02:23:50 it will reveal.
02:23:52 I'll stick it to the video.
02:23:53 Was this because we did the whole Thomas the Tank Engine
02:23:56 joke last week?
02:23:58 I don't fucking know, dude.
02:23:59 Maybe.
02:24:01 I don't even remember what I had for breakfast this morning.
02:24:03 Oh, wait.
02:24:04 Yes, I do.
02:24:05 It was nothing.
02:24:06 Well, there's one thing we've learned.
02:24:08 It's that Percy is a cunt.
02:24:10 And, uh...
02:24:12 Alright, so what else, Tom?
02:24:13 Even back when I was like five, I knew that.
02:24:14 Oh, by the way, I just want to say, Lost Archives,
02:24:19 this and all the other ones have been absolutely fucking primal.
02:24:24 I think we have a contender for the voicemail grail.
02:24:29 Oh, yeah, I think we've got to add it.
02:24:30 Yeah, I think we've got to add it, yes.
02:24:31 Now, you know, I forgot to add someone last week, I think.
02:24:35 People in the comments were making suggestions
02:24:38 about who should be on the Hall of Fame,
02:24:40 and I agreed with every single one.
02:24:42 Oh, yeah, okay.
02:24:44 I think we shouldn't get too much in the business
02:24:46 of retroactive ones, but maybe the next two.
02:24:49 Well, let's see if we have something.
02:24:51 Let's see if we have any more contenders, shall we?
02:24:53 Yeah.
02:24:54 Oh, yes, I agree.
02:24:55 And I think we might, right here,
02:24:57 with a humble lad by the name of John.
02:25:01 Let's see what John has to say, or rather, sing.
02:25:05 One, two, this one's a question for the whole damn PCP.
02:25:09 That is, I want to know your favorite song.
02:25:13 But that's too easy, so we'll turn it up a notch.
02:25:16 Find the truth of the good and something wrong.
02:25:19 Sometimes great music can exist.
02:25:22 In media, you'd otherwise resist.
02:25:26 Where have you seen put to waste?
02:25:29 Good music that's locked in a cage.
02:25:31 The source, of course, it blinds you with rage.
02:25:35 I've heard this before.
02:25:37 This is Adrenaline by Tricell.
02:25:39 It's a kick-ass song.
02:25:41 It ends the arrow among a sense and an amaze.
02:25:44 That's, that's the one.
02:25:44 Subjectively I say this show is not okay.
02:25:47 But the song is so good, it takes the pain away.
02:25:51 The washer spins, you hear the bass, a giddy does her dance.
02:25:55 Her brother doesn't get to wash her underpants.
02:25:58 It puts me in a trance.
02:26:00 The brainwashing sits in, I drink my gin.
02:26:04 New episodes begin.
02:26:06 So what's your favorite song you know?
02:26:09 That comes from a bad movie, Game or Show.
02:26:14 John, that was great.
02:26:15 Oh, that's amazing.
02:26:17 That was better.
02:26:18 What was that even better than?
02:26:20 I want that set to the actual E.D.
02:26:23 So I could watch the Geary Dancer sexy little
02:26:25 lolly ass to that song.
02:26:27 What, what was the, I don't know.
02:26:30 Before we even get to the question,
02:26:32 before we get to the question, I just want to say
02:26:34 the dichotomy, because I picked out the show notes
02:26:36 because Nate was doing the math of the things.
02:26:39 And I did the voicemails for this.
02:26:42 And the dichotomy, there was an entry to the voicemails
02:26:45 of a dude saying, if anyone else other than Nate
02:26:49 picks the voicemails this episode, this won't get in.
02:26:51 But smoke weed, dude.
02:26:54 And that literally would have gotten in.
02:26:56 It would have gotten in.
02:26:57 Dude, it would have gotten in.
02:26:58 You say blame Munchie that you weren't.
02:27:00 Yeah, so your spotlight.
02:27:02 Fuck you, you're, I'm not even going to name you.
02:27:04 So die, just fucking die.
02:27:07 So there's just FYI.
02:27:08 John, John in parentheses, Ori Emo,
02:27:10 and I guess I'll put Aromanga, already got in
02:27:12 last episode into the PCP Grail.
02:27:15 But so, so he's a legend.
02:27:16 He's a legend.
02:27:17 What is the name of the Hall of Fame?
02:27:19 We call the voicemail Grail, as we're calling it.
02:27:22 It's just the Grail slash jail.
02:27:24 And you're in jail.
02:27:24 It's the voicemail versus the voice jail.
02:27:26 The only man in jail right now is the Japanese man, Yuta.
02:27:29 And he'll never get out.
02:27:32 I'm, I'm trying to, I'm going back.
02:27:33 I'm trying to find where people made recommendations.
02:27:35 So are we going to answer that guy's question?
02:27:38 Yeah, yeah.
02:27:38 Of course.
02:27:40 I mean, if we're sticking with like anime EDs,
02:27:42 if that's something that could count,
02:27:44 the OP to the show, Denpa Onato Seishun Otoko,
02:27:48 or electric, wait, I don't even remember
02:27:51 what the fuck that translates to.
02:27:53 Denpa means train, I think?
02:27:54 I don't know.
02:27:55 It's, no, Denpa.
02:27:57 Denpa Onato Seishun Otoko.
02:27:59 It's, it's the opening theme is by a band
02:28:02 called Shinsei Komate-chan.
02:28:04 It introduced them to me and they became my favorite band.
02:28:07 I dropped the show after the first episode,
02:28:10 but I've come back to that OP countless times.
02:28:12 That's cool.
02:28:13 There's a difference between a song from media
02:28:17 that you hate or media that you haven't seen.
02:28:19 And while there, I can't really think of any songs of,
02:28:23 for media that I hate.
02:28:25 I can definitely think of songs that I love
02:28:26 from things I'd never played,
02:28:27 which I think is arguably way more embarrassing
02:28:31 where you start humming a song and then someone's like,
02:28:34 uh, you know, oh, you like a cave story.
02:28:36 I'm like, uh, no, I just got recommended the theme song.
02:28:39 Egg passage.
02:28:40 And I really like it.
02:28:40 That's like it in my head.
02:28:42 Yeah.
02:28:42 Yeah.
02:28:44 Oh yeah.
02:28:45 So fucking good.
02:28:46 So there's a lot of instances where I, uh,
02:28:48 shamefully listen to music, uh, of things I've never seen.
02:28:52 Like again, cave story.
02:28:53 I listen to the Cowboy Bebop soundtrack a lot.
02:28:55 Well, that's just based.
02:28:57 I know it's all, it's all good.
02:28:58 I mean, the Cowboy Bebop soundtrack shows up on like,
02:29:01 recommended lists of just good jazz albums.
02:29:03 Like, I don't think there's any shame in listening to that.
02:29:05 Even though fucking Kano learned how to make jazz
02:29:08 for that album.
02:29:09 Incredible.
02:29:09 But, but I literally don't even know what Cowboy Bebop does,
02:29:13 or if it's like a Doctor Who scenario.
02:29:14 Who is this man?
02:29:15 There is no Cowboy Bebop.
02:29:16 What are his credentials?
02:29:18 Where is he?
02:29:19 Get him out of here.
02:29:19 Does he even bebop?
02:29:26 All right.
02:29:26 I don't know.
02:29:27 I mean, here's just an easy example.
02:29:29 I mean, I love a lot of the music in MLP,
02:29:31 but I also love MLP.
02:29:33 So, I mean, it's not embarrassing at all,
02:29:34 but a lot of people might think it is.
02:29:36 So there you go.
02:29:37 There's my answer.
02:29:37 That's a flaccid shit.
02:29:39 I really have to wreck my brain to find a show I dislike,
02:29:42 but I also like the music of.
02:29:44 So, I can't really answer it completely,
02:29:46 but one song that comes to my head is of a show I haven't watched,
02:29:51 but I didn't hear good things about it.
02:29:54 But I kind of like the opening,
02:29:55 but I think I like the opening music in addition to the visuals.
02:30:00 So, if I haven't seen the visuals,
02:30:02 I probably wouldn't like the song as much,
02:30:03 but I still like the song.
02:30:04 Sure, sure.
02:30:05 Is of Maria Holik?
02:30:08 I think that's.
02:30:09 Yeah, Maria Holik OP.
02:30:10 That would be my number.
02:30:12 Same studio as Denpo.
02:30:13 Oh, another one I brought up.
02:30:15 And yeah, I mean, all their OPs are fucking amazing.
02:30:17 Every Shaft OP is.
02:30:18 Shaft kills it, though.
02:30:19 So, whether the show itself is good.
02:30:21 Oh, you know, I could say.
02:30:23 I also dropped that one.
02:30:25 On the Shaft subject.
02:30:26 Yeah, like, did you say, like, all their openings are great.
02:30:28 Everything for, god damn it, Zetsubo Sensei.
02:30:32 Oh.
02:30:32 Like, I've only finished.
02:30:33 I've only finished season one and, like,
02:30:35 maybe a little bit of season two,
02:30:36 but I've listened to every OP and they're all incredible.
02:30:39 I love Zetsubo Sensei.
02:30:40 Have you listened to the Otsuki Kenji and Zetsubo Shojo Tachi album?
02:30:47 No, I definitely have not.
02:30:48 So, the guy who sings in all the OPs is a guy named Otsuki Kenji.
02:30:52 He's a frontman of a band called Kiniku Shojo Tai,
02:30:55 or the, like, bodybuilding women's club or something like that.
02:31:00 And they did a whole album of songs in the style of the OPs.
02:31:05 It has the OPs on there and then, like,
02:31:07 just a bunch of other tracks of him and all the girls singing,
02:31:09 and it's a good time.
02:31:11 It sounds incredible.
02:31:12 I mean, the best thing about it for me is that it's,
02:31:15 you watch the show, you get used to the voice actors and whatnot,
02:31:17 who are, you know, they're in the fucking show,
02:31:19 all the girls and the main guy and whatnot,
02:31:21 and they just sing in the fucking opening and ending,
02:31:23 and it's, like, the best thing ever.
02:31:24 It's so fucking sick.
02:31:26 And then you go listen to the full songs,
02:31:27 it's, like, even better.
02:31:28 They're so good.
02:31:29 But, yeah, I mean, I should definitely check that out.
02:31:31 Tom, Benny Boy.
02:31:34 Yep.
02:31:34 Any answer?
02:31:35 Any, any?
02:31:36 Um, I guess...
02:31:37 Oh, no.
02:31:38 I can't think of anything.
02:31:39 I'm sorry, Normie.
02:31:40 The only thing I can think of right now is...
02:31:42 Tisk, tisk, tisk, tisk.
02:31:43 The only thing I can really think of is,
02:31:45 I wasn't a huge fan of the game, Crypt of the Necrodancer.
02:31:48 I couldn't get into the game,
02:31:49 but the soundtrack is fucking sick.
02:31:50 Oh, that's a good video game!
02:31:52 Okay, well, I'll agree with that, except that's a great game.
02:31:54 I'm, I just...
02:31:55 Yeah, punk.
02:31:56 It's funny you say that, Tom, because...
02:31:57 I haven't played a lot of it.
02:31:58 My buddy, we did co-op, and I couldn't really get into it.
02:32:01 I hate these SJW games with female protagonists.
02:32:04 Like, what the fuck, guys?
02:32:06 Just shut it down now!
02:32:08 Who are you, Sargon of a God?
02:32:10 It's really funny that you, that you,
02:32:12 that, like, the music is what stuck out to you,
02:32:14 because to me, the appeal of that game was that I could
02:32:16 dance to my own music.
02:32:18 You know, that's cool, but I've tried it, and it, it, it, it...
02:32:23 You have to find the right song.
02:32:24 Like, sometimes, like, it...
02:32:25 Yeah, yeah.
02:32:25 You need to find the right song.
02:32:27 But, that game has such a good soundtrack on its own
02:32:29 that I have, like, no real desire to replace the music.
02:32:32 It's not really my genre, I guess.
02:32:34 I, I was, I just, I put in music by the band Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,
02:32:38 which is, like, like, heavy metal dance music, basically,
02:32:42 and, um, that made it, like, it was just so funny
02:32:45 to play along to that I made it worth it.
02:32:48 Oh, I, on a, on a stream, twitch, twitch.tv slash stank comics,
02:32:52 I put in, I put in some Hilary Duff Nightcore as a...
02:32:55 Excellent.
02:32:56 As the, uh, as the sound backing sound.
02:32:58 It didn't work very well at all.
02:32:59 Actually, no, the thing is, it was just so fast.
02:33:02 Yeah.
02:33:02 It was, like, this insanely fast beat.
02:33:04 Yeah, you really gotta know the beat.
02:33:06 You know what would probably help a lot is, uh, there's a website called...
02:33:09 There's a website called Songkick that tells you the BPM of any song.
02:33:14 Oh, good, yeah, yeah.
02:33:15 That's what you need.
02:33:16 Yeah.
02:33:17 Yeah.
02:33:18 Ha, ha, ha, ha.
02:33:19 We have fun here at the PCP.
02:33:21 But you know what else is fun?
02:33:22 Having sex with animals.
02:33:24 Well, there may be some animals you aren't really sure about how to have sex with.
02:33:27 Well, luckily, we have an ice member teaching us how to have sex with hyenas.
02:33:32 So about hyenas.
02:33:34 Hyenas are my jam.
02:33:35 So I know a lot about the hyena penis situation.
02:33:39 Very cool.
02:33:40 So yeah, it's called the pseudo penis despite actually being a slitheress.
02:33:44 But you'd be surprised to know that it functions more like a penis than like a clitoris.
02:33:49 I am surprised.
02:33:51 Hyena is actually...
02:33:52 I'm a rouse.
02:33:54 Their sex is like docking.
02:33:55 Like the male has a penis inside the female pseudo penis, which has a canal.
02:34:00 What the fuck?
02:34:01 What?
02:34:01 For this sort of like the vagina like is in the clitoris.
02:34:05 It's very strange.
02:34:06 OK, sure.
02:34:07 What the fuck?
02:34:08 When people say, oh, it's a pseudo penis, but it's actually a clit.
02:34:11 It's like it's really just a dick.
02:34:13 Like, I don't know what else to tell you.
02:34:14 But like, which is why hyena society is so female dominated.
02:34:18 It's because the males can't assert their dominance on the females via sex.
02:34:21 Like, if the females aren't into it, like the males aren't going to snake their dick
02:34:24 into the lady's dick.
02:34:25 It's just not going to happen.
02:34:28 But yeah, actually, they also give birth out of their pseudo penis.
02:34:31 And that's just a glory mess.
02:34:33 So you can make up videos if you want.
02:34:34 I guess that would be the yikes.
02:34:36 That's what I have to say.
02:34:37 Hyenas are pretty neat.
02:34:38 Just don't touch their penises.
02:34:40 OK, bye.
02:34:41 Boy, we really fucked up when we opened this rabbit hole.
02:34:46 I'm the one who opened up this mystery box.
02:34:49 I'm about to do it.
02:34:55 Sorry, I was just clapping really fast.
02:35:00 In triumph.
02:35:00 In sheer triumph.
02:35:03 Also, I came on really bad.
02:35:06 Well, hyenas are sick.
02:35:07 I feel bad.
02:35:08 I guess I feel bad for the women.
02:35:09 Hyenas are sick.
02:35:10 I feel bad for the men and the women.
02:35:12 Like, the men are, you know, whatever.
02:35:14 They can't get their shit going because they're smaller and they got small dick.
02:35:17 They got to insert in female dick.
02:35:19 And women, like, have to birth out of their fucking female dick.
02:35:22 That sounds horrible.
02:35:23 Birth out of their dick, dude.
02:35:24 It's made for it.
02:35:25 Holy shit.
02:35:26 I guess.
02:35:26 I guess.
02:35:27 They love it.
02:35:27 Guys, I love it.
02:35:28 Nature's M-Preg.
02:35:30 Radcon 4.
02:35:32 First stretch goal, docking.
02:35:34 Second stretch goal, live birth.
02:35:37 Stretch goal 5.
02:35:38 M-Preg.
02:35:40 Et cetera, et cetera.
02:35:42 By the way, guys.
02:35:42 We can combine all these.
02:35:43 Are you right?
02:35:44 Thank you, Yeen girl.
02:35:45 There's synergy here.
02:35:47 And speaking of, speaking of Yeen girl, I just want to say you've heard of Yeen.
02:35:52 You've heard of SNEP.
02:35:54 Get ready for the third furry term in this trilogy.
02:35:58 And this is an open letter to every furry.
02:36:00 What is Yeen?
02:36:01 I don't know what I didn't know.
02:36:02 SNEP is Snow Leopard.
02:36:03 Oh, OK.
02:36:03 It's really funny because that girl's voice sounded like Kaze.
02:36:08 And it made me assume.
02:36:08 I thought it might have been her.
02:36:09 Did it?
02:36:10 Did it really?
02:36:11 I, yeah.
02:36:12 Yeah, a little bit.
02:36:12 I think it might just be that furry.
02:36:14 Like, is furry kind of like being gay?
02:36:15 They're cut from the same claw.
02:36:16 Like a voice.
02:36:18 You know what I mean?
02:36:19 I've got big furry voice.
02:36:20 Kind of like tranny voice, you know?
02:36:22 Furry voice.
02:36:23 Muffled by fur.
02:36:23 We will let the audience decide in the comments.
02:36:25 You know, comment is furry a choice like being gay.
02:36:28 Yeah, OK.
02:36:28 But also in that.
02:36:30 Say a choice.
02:36:31 I said a voice.
02:36:32 Is it a choice like being black?
02:36:34 Both are open.
02:36:35 OK.
02:36:35 So post in comments.
02:36:37 Any more of these abbreviation for animals like SNEP or Yeen.
02:36:40 And we have, yote.
02:36:44 For coyotes, yote.
02:36:47 Yote.
02:36:48 Use this sentence.
02:36:49 Want to fuck that yote real bad.
02:36:52 Maybe I'll put some yeens later and maybe a SNEP.
02:36:55 But first, I want to deal with this yote.
02:37:00 Wow.
02:37:00 That's all I wanted to say.
02:37:01 That's good.
02:37:03 I love these terms so much.
02:37:05 Please, I fucking beg you.
02:37:08 I'm sure there's a gold mine of them that I, we aren't.
02:37:10 You know, OK.
02:37:11 You know how when you're speed running Pokemon red or blue,
02:37:14 you choose like one character?
02:37:16 Because the sheer number of times that your character's
02:37:18 like name is said in text box.
02:37:20 Imagine the sheer number of frames you're saving
02:37:22 by only referring because we know how many times per day
02:37:25 you're going to talk about a coyote and how much you want to fuck it.
02:37:28 You're saving so many frames by a briefing that you're saving.
02:37:31 Two syllables.
02:37:31 So many.
02:37:32 Every single time.
02:37:33 That's right.
02:37:33 Hey, if you're, if you're, if you're a coyote, if you're a coyote furry
02:37:37 and you're like a bear, right?
02:37:38 But like not like a bear bear, like a muslin.
02:37:41 You're like getting, you're getting fucking jacked.
02:37:43 You're fucking getting, are you a yoke to yoke?
02:37:45 A yoke to yoke for show.
02:37:47 A yoke to yoke.
02:37:48 Oh, my new Twitter handle.
02:37:53 Well, move on.
02:37:54 Let's go.
02:37:55 Guys, this, I'm, there's going to be hours.
02:37:57 I know, I need a fucking, I need a fucking cold shower after this.
02:37:59 Hours of content coming from this.
02:38:00 OK, all right.
02:38:01 Now, speaking of D&D, we were talking about earlier,
02:38:04 there's someone who would like to play a game with us as well,
02:38:07 but not a role playing game, rather a board game.
02:38:10 This is the game board, Gaylord.
02:38:11 Game board, Gaylord.
02:38:13 Attention, PCB.
02:38:14 This is the game board, Gaylord speaking.
02:38:17 Wow.
02:38:17 I challenge you to beat me in a board game.
02:38:19 Let's play battleship on a five by five grid.
02:38:22 We will be using one, four-tall ship, one, three-tall ship, and two, two-tall ships.
02:38:29 Please place your ships now, and I'll begin my turn.
02:38:33 A four.
02:38:36 You suck my battleship.
02:38:37 Will you hit me?
02:38:38 Who knows?
02:38:39 This has been the game board, Gaylord.
02:38:41 Good luck.
02:38:42 And remember, I won't fucking cheat.
02:38:44 I swear, please trust me for the love of God and everything, holy.
02:38:48 Well, OK, so we are in a dice scenario right now.
02:38:53 We are on a five by five grid right now.
02:38:55 He's attacked A, what was it?
02:38:58 A-F.
02:38:58 A four, I think.
02:38:59 A four.
02:39:00 A four, A four.
02:39:01 All right, A-F.
02:39:02 And he is, let's see, guys, did he sink our battleship?
02:39:06 Let's see.
02:39:07 Look, the game board, Gaylord, is a fool because he told us where he's going to attack before
02:39:13 we even had time to place our ships.
02:39:15 Now I can dodge it perfectly.
02:39:17 OK, OK, so how much?
02:39:18 OK, we have a three-tile ship, a four-tile ship, and a two-tile ship.
02:39:21 Two two-tiles, I think.
02:39:24 Pretty sure.
02:39:25 We are attacking C-six.
02:39:28 There you go.
02:39:28 Damn.
02:39:29 Wait, no, it's a five by five.
02:39:30 Six is off the grid, god damn it.
02:39:32 Yeah, yeah.
02:39:32 C-five, C-five.
02:39:34 Wait, how can you fit that many fucking boats on a five by five grid?
02:39:37 I think you can.
02:39:38 You can.
02:39:38 The biggest one's four, so it doesn't have to be a hit.
02:39:40 Well, we're just hitting constantly, and it's just a race to see if you can sink.
02:39:44 Like, who makes the mistake of missing once and therefore losing?
02:39:47 I mean, that's battleship for you, I guess.
02:39:49 That's a great game.
02:39:52 Well, good luck with that.
02:39:53 Hell yeah.
02:39:54 I've never played battleship before, but let us just show that we will kill you and all of your boats.
02:39:59 You don't need to play the game.
02:40:00 Just watch the movie.
02:40:01 Yeah, that is right.
02:40:02 Is there a movie for battleship?
02:40:03 There is a battleship movie.
02:40:05 Rihanna, I think.
02:40:06 Fuck.
02:40:06 Rihanna starts at the battleship.
02:40:09 Right?
02:40:09 It was like a Michael Bay style movie.
02:40:12 Yeah, it was a Michael Bay style theatrical release starring Rihanna.
02:40:16 Hell yeah.
02:40:17 Yeah, as the titular battleship.
02:40:21 That's crazy.
02:40:24 Well, guys, we seem to have reached it in here.
02:40:26 Wait.
02:40:29 Could there be?
02:40:30 I think there's someone.
02:40:32 I think there's something that needs
02:40:35 to be concluded in arc that needs to be satisfied.
02:40:40 What could it be?
02:40:40 Someone's been building up for months at this point for weeks.
02:40:46 And that's the end of the riddle my ass Batman arc.
02:40:51 Oh no.
02:40:52 There are three voicemails.
02:40:54 I've not listened to any of them.
02:40:56 So we're going to experience them together.
02:40:58 Okay.
02:41:00 Here we go, boys.
02:41:03 Well, you all have been waiting for it.
02:41:05 If you want to dumb, I've got what you need,
02:41:07 because the next voicemail is from a riddle my ass, Batman.
02:41:10 Batman who vapes Ben Saints.
02:41:13 Yeah.
02:41:14 We're not doing well.
02:41:15 We're not doing well.
02:41:15 Why does it sound like he recorded this?
02:41:17 Yeah.
02:41:17 Do not speak.
02:41:18 I'm sure he did.
02:41:19 I'm sure he did.
02:41:19 I'm going to have a man more.
02:41:21 VG also stands for best guy.
02:41:27 Woo.
02:41:28 Yay.
02:41:29 Yay.
02:41:29 Why are we getting a recap episode?
02:41:32 You got to have the clip episode before the finale.
02:41:34 Joe, I've never heard about this.
02:41:36 You know, he really should have worked on his recording.
02:41:38 God, they stuck.
02:41:39 They really stuck.
02:41:40 You just skipped the head.
02:41:41 No, no, no, no.
02:41:42 No, I like this.
02:41:44 You got to have Bill that.
02:41:45 He's a man of all names.
02:41:46 First member riddle my ass, Batman.
02:41:47 Yeah.
02:41:47 Welcome to the stand.
02:41:49 Woo.
02:41:52 Oh, Batman.
02:41:54 Oh, Batman.
02:41:55 He's a sheep.
02:41:56 He's Batman.
02:41:56 I said sheep.
02:41:58 Oh, I remember when he saved me.
02:42:00 Oh, that was good.
02:42:01 I can't even tell what the fuck he said.
02:42:03 So God, this is shitty recording.
02:42:10 Oh, I got room to cook.
02:42:12 Oh, yeah.
02:42:16 I just want you to know that when a day in sim comes out,
02:42:19 I'm using you as my lover.
02:42:20 It don't work.
02:42:22 Yay.
02:42:22 I remember that.
02:42:23 He's never fucking had.
02:42:24 I think so.
02:42:25 It's a sign of inclusion of real my ass, Batman.
02:42:29 Oh, thank God.
02:42:29 Oh, yeah.
02:42:30 There it is.
02:42:31 Okay.
02:42:32 All right.
02:42:32 All right.
02:42:32 All right.
02:42:33 Well, that was the entirety of.
02:42:34 Okay.
02:42:34 Okay.
02:42:34 Okay.
02:42:35 Here we are.
02:42:36 The end of an era.
02:42:37 The final battle.
02:42:38 Are you guys ready?
02:42:39 Because, frankly, I'm not.
02:42:40 I feel like I'm underprepared.
02:42:41 I'm not going to battle.
02:42:42 Only Digi remains to be saved, I think.
02:42:45 Well, let's see if he will be.
02:42:47 Batman left.
02:42:48 So members of PCP, are you ready for a final riddle?
02:42:53 Question first.
02:42:54 Yes.
02:42:55 Since there's only one member left,
02:42:56 can we just say it's Digi and go away pretty easily?
02:42:59 Wait, guys, don't do that.
02:43:01 Huh?
02:43:02 Hear me out.
02:43:02 You guys know my lifelong dream has become a loli.
02:43:05 Well, this is my chance.
02:43:07 My ass is so fast that I already have tits.
02:43:11 And I got to do this and get rid of my digging balls now.
02:43:14 This is a perfect opportunity.
02:43:15 Please, help me be a loli.
02:43:17 Are you sure, Digi?
02:43:17 I guess if you eat the balls.
02:43:18 Yes.
02:43:18 Wow.
02:43:19 Okay, Digi.
02:43:20 Riddler, our answer is the riddle you have not yet answered.
02:43:23 Question is...
02:43:27 Jeff.
02:43:28 Wrong.
02:43:28 Yeah.
02:43:29 Oh.
02:43:31 Put him in the testicular tenderizing tuna now.
02:43:34 Thank you, guys, so much.
02:43:35 And this is...
02:43:36 Oh, my God, the pain.
02:43:38 The pain is so unbearable.
02:43:40 Oh, my God, the pain.
02:43:41 Oh, no.
02:43:42 Oh, no.
02:43:43 Not the pain.
02:43:45 Oh, my God, the pain.
02:43:46 This is a mistake.
02:43:47 Not the pain.
02:43:48 Oh, my God, the pain.
02:43:50 The pain is unbearable.
02:43:52 Oh, my God.
02:43:54 No.
02:43:55 I'm sensing some pain here.
02:43:56 Balls and dick?
02:43:57 Help, help, help.
02:43:59 Help, please.
02:43:59 Help, please.
02:44:00 This is indulgent.
02:44:01 Let me do this.
02:44:02 Guys, help.
02:44:03 Help, help, help.
02:44:05 Anyone else?
02:44:06 Oh, my God, the balls and dick.
02:44:08 Oh, shit.
02:44:10 Gratuitous.
02:44:12 Damn.
02:44:12 Okay.
02:44:13 What is that?
02:44:13 That was...
02:44:14 Next one.
02:44:14 Next one.
02:44:14 Next one.
02:44:15 All right, all right, all right.
02:44:16 Well, I got...
02:44:18 I hate to say it, Digi, but I guess you don't got a dick anymore.
02:44:20 Was that me?
02:44:21 Balls.
02:44:22 Yeah, that's you.
02:44:23 That's you.
02:44:23 That was you.
02:44:24 I feel like I just listened to someone's manic episode.
02:44:26 I have no fucking idea what's going on.
02:44:28 No, Digi doesn't even know what's happening.
02:44:31 Okay, you were over a pit of dick eating piranhas,
02:44:35 dick and ball eating piranhas,
02:44:37 and you told Batman to not save you
02:44:39 by solving all the Ask Batman riddles.
02:44:39 No, no, Batman left.
02:44:40 It's just the PCPs.
02:44:41 Batman and peace.
02:44:42 And therefore, you were dropped into the pit.
02:44:44 It burns.
02:44:44 Right, right.
02:44:45 To become a loli.
02:44:46 Yeah, duh.
02:44:47 Okay, so here we go.
02:44:48 So is there one more?
02:44:49 There's one final thing, right?
02:44:50 Yeah, there's one more.
02:44:52 I just want to say this is real my Ask Batman.
02:44:55 Thank you, PCP, for playing my shitty show
02:44:58 every week, week after week.
02:45:00 You and the audience at home seem to have
02:45:01 really loved this show,
02:45:03 and I appreciate your support.
02:45:04 You did.
02:45:05 A quick apology to Mage and Digi
02:45:07 for dropping you in the dick eating worms.
02:45:09 I had to switch it up every once in a while,
02:45:10 you know, even we had some.
02:45:12 I keep them on their toes.
02:45:13 Yeah, absolutely.
02:45:14 Don't worry.
02:45:14 Riddle my Ask Batman isn't canceled yet.
02:45:16 I am just getting started.
02:45:18 Look forward to new content,
02:45:20 such as silly songs with Batman.
02:45:22 Who wants to be a PCP millionaire?
02:45:24 And reading from Riddle My Ask Batman's fan fiction.
02:45:26 Look forward to all these next time on the PCP.
02:45:29 Same PCP time, same PCP channel.
02:45:32 Yay!
02:45:33 Oh my god!
02:45:34 Oh my god!
02:45:34 The legend.
02:45:35 When are we going to get a...
02:45:36 The legend walks off into the sun.
02:45:37 When do we get family feud in Batman's ass?
02:45:40 Oh, silly life.
02:45:41 In Batman's ass, hell yeah.
02:45:43 So I want to remind everyone
02:45:45 that Riddle My Ask Batman has a work of fiction
02:45:49 on Wattpad called PCP, The Ultamite Fanfic.
02:45:53 The Quest for Cold Corona
02:45:55 by Riddle My Ask Batman.
02:45:56 I'm going to read
02:45:58 a passage from the first chapter called
02:45:58 a Passage from the first chapter called
02:46:02 PCP Guy Origins.
02:46:03 1.1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
02:46:33 I hear you scream in your most annoying of high-pitched, glass-shattering, screechy ones.
02:46:39 Fear not, for there were just enough freaks and weirdos to make all the anime and comics,
02:46:43 you know, actual cool stuff that your heart could ever desire.
02:46:46 On this planet there lived in an old, run-down apartment,
02:46:49 one man who swore he would not subcome to the life of a normie
02:46:53 and sought to make his living as an artist.
02:46:56 He had tried many disciplines drawing comics, playing music, mostly raps,
02:47:00 and even writing his world's equivalent of My Little Pony fan fiction.
02:47:04 Always putting his OC in the middle of a love triangle
02:47:07 of whatever characters he happened to be feeling a fancy for the week.
02:47:10 However, his favorite thing to do was to make analytical YouTube videos about his favorite anime.
02:47:14 Well, it is actually rendered to a looser tube on this planet.
02:47:18 Two as a... okay.
02:47:19 They were a bit more self-aware.
02:47:21 Our beloved original handboy, PCPGuy, also known by the name Crass,
02:47:26 short for pro-crass to his internet friends.
02:47:29 He had no real life to speak of.
02:47:31 So that's your tool.
02:47:33 I want to know.
02:47:34 Link in the description.
02:47:35 The stage has been set.
02:47:36 I hope that that's just enough to whet your whistle.
02:47:38 I'm intrigued.
02:47:39 I want to know more about this cast of characters.
02:47:41 Well, there's only one, but you know.
02:47:42 I have a question.
02:47:44 Is there, like, somewhere where you would listen to, like,
02:47:47 a real me as Batman's all of the story,
02:47:50 like in a chronological order?
02:47:52 I mean, they're all on episodes?
02:47:55 Or, I mean, they're in the South Club?
02:47:58 Though, things are getting deleted from the SoundCloud,
02:48:00 so, you know, they're little by little.
02:48:03 But they're all in the episodes.
02:48:04 Archive, people, it's up to you.
02:48:05 It's up to you to save FlashPlayer.
02:48:07 Maybe...
02:48:08 Wait, I mean, are they all still in the speak pipe?
02:48:12 I suppose that's true.
02:48:13 I haven't deleted any from speak pipe.
02:48:15 Maybe I'll just go in and make a compilation.
02:48:18 You know, I've been working on that editor,
02:48:20 that editor show case.
02:48:21 Right, how's that going?
02:48:22 It wouldn't be the same to just listen to the...
02:48:25 Like, surely if you wanted a compilation,
02:48:27 you would want to clip it from the episodes
02:48:29 so that you get the reaction as well.
02:48:31 That's probably true, honestly.
02:48:33 Probably be better that way, significantly so.
02:48:35 Yeah.
02:48:36 I think so.
02:48:38 I think it adds something.
02:48:40 Well, commenters, let us know in the comments
02:48:44 if you want that.
02:48:46 Or just do it for us.
02:48:48 Yeah, that's true.
02:48:49 Or yeah, yeah, that's true.
02:48:51 We've come to the end of Real Me As Batman,
02:48:53 and we've come to the end of this week's PCP.
02:48:56 How do we all feel?
02:48:57 How do we all feel about how we did it this week?
02:48:59 Hungry.
02:49:00 It was long.
02:49:01 Review, review.
02:49:02 They're always this long now, Nate.
02:49:03 This is just how they are.
02:49:04 That's true.
02:49:05 You're not wrong.
02:49:06 You're not wrong.
02:49:07 They've gotten longer.
02:49:08 Almost three hours.
02:49:09 I'm also hungry.
02:49:10 I'm hungry.
02:49:11 Maybe I can go...
02:49:12 Maybe before my stream at twitch.tv slash stcomics,
02:49:16 I can go and maybe I can...
02:49:18 There's probably not enough time to view keto donuts.
02:49:20 Perhaps not.
02:49:21 My...
02:49:22 Damn.
02:49:23 Next time you hear from me, boys,
02:49:25 you'll see in Boston, Massachusetts,
02:49:27 possibly have met with Ben.
02:49:29 Oh, okay.
02:49:30 And Tom, if he's...
02:49:31 How's his journey?
02:49:32 Yeah, we'll have to hang out again.
02:49:33 Yes.
02:49:34 Yeah, last time was a bust.
02:49:36 Now there will be a bust out of a nut.
02:49:39 You know what I'm trying to say?
02:49:41 Yeah.
02:49:42 Are you saying, Mitch?
02:49:43 Don't set any toes on your way there.
02:49:47 Don't worry.
02:49:48 I don't walk extremely angrily and also am stupid.
02:49:53 His legs flailing wildly in all directions as he walks.
02:49:57 Like kicking the air each time he lifts his legs.
02:49:59 Like as hard as you can.
02:50:00 Like he's going to punt like a football.
02:50:01 Just begging for it.
02:50:02 Just begging for it.
02:50:03 Get the...
02:50:04 Get the fucking...
02:50:05 Get on our Patreon.
02:50:06 Bonus episodes.
02:50:08 Yeah.
02:50:09 Peace at patreon.com slash the procrastinators people.
02:50:12 $5 for 25 full bonus episodes.
02:50:15 And another one coming before too long.
02:50:16 So keep your eyes fucking healed.
02:50:17 Also, the last one...
02:50:18 I'm really happy with the last one.
02:50:20 I thought it was really, really funny and good.
02:50:22 And we learned a lot of the dark truths about it.
02:50:24 We did.
02:50:25 I realized that I just initiated the close out of this podcast.
02:50:27 But I have to also ask, did anybody on this podcast ever address that I did in fact find
02:50:32 and talk about the pizza party podcast?
02:50:34 I'm sorry.
02:50:35 What?
02:50:36 Was this addressed on a PC?
02:50:37 Question mark?
02:50:38 I don't...
02:50:39 No.
02:50:40 That can't be true.
02:50:41 I went on Who Are These Podcasts and did a whole podcast about the pizza party podcast.
02:50:45 What the fuck?
02:50:46 Well, frankly, I think you're talking out of your ass.
02:50:48 How did you find out about that?
02:50:50 It was not easy.
02:50:52 I had to go into the heart of Tibet.
02:50:54 I found them.
02:50:55 I had to climb a mountain.
02:50:56 I had to find Shambhala.
02:50:57 I had to play Uncharted 2.
02:51:00 This has opened up a whole new avenue.
02:51:04 A whole new avenue of X and Y.
02:51:05 We have to drive in this.
02:51:06 I feel like the mystery has only deepened.
02:51:08 We were so concerned.
02:51:10 We were so concerned if we could find the podcast.
02:51:12 We didn't find out if we should or not.
02:51:14 The answer is we definitely shouldn't have.
02:51:17 It was a huge mistake.
02:51:19 We should keep going.
02:51:20 We should keep going.
02:51:21 Yes, someone was concerned if the pizza party podcast got the food.
02:51:24 That's why he's not here.
02:51:25 Oh my God.
02:51:26 Oh, God.
02:51:27 No.
02:51:28 We can't let this happen.
02:51:29 Another lost soul.
02:51:31 All right.
02:51:32 Well, I guess that's it.
02:51:33 I don't know.
02:51:34 Shirts or something.
02:51:35 I don't even know what we do.
02:51:36 There's a Patreon.
02:51:37 I know that exists.
02:51:38 Patreon.com.
02:51:39 The Procrastinators people.
02:51:40 We love the money.
02:51:41 Please give us.
02:51:42 And bonus episodes.
02:51:43 Those are the main drive.
02:51:44 25 fucking episodes.
02:51:45 That's so many.
02:51:46 Jesus Christ.
02:51:47 All right.
02:51:48 We're at TPCrastinators on Twitter.
02:51:49 Updates, releases, et cetera, et cetera.
02:51:51 General upkeep.
02:51:52 There you go.
02:51:53 Hey, you know what?
02:51:54 Okay.
02:51:55 Okay.
02:51:56 New plug thing for me specifically.
02:51:57 All right.
02:51:58 I like like comments.
02:52:00 Not as in I want you to comment for like the algorithm.
02:52:02 I don't even know if that works.
02:52:03 I don't know if that's the thing.
02:52:04 Probably is.
02:52:05 It's better for you.
02:52:06 Probably is.
02:52:07 I just like reading them.
02:52:08 So no, just make your comments not shit and also do more of them because I like to hear
02:52:13 from you.
02:52:14 Like, I think the only, it's a weird feedback loop where I think that the PCP comments are
02:52:19 terrible because they think we don't read them.
02:52:22 The reason we don't read them is because they're terrible.
02:52:25 So just assume we're reading them and make them better and then I think they've gotten
02:52:31 better.
02:52:32 I haven't looked in a little while.
02:52:33 So for me, I never really read the PCP comments too much, but it's just that for now, like
02:52:38 I consider my job, my job is done once I've released the episode for the month or like
02:52:43 it's scheduled ahead of time or whatever.
02:52:45 I mean, I care about what people think and I want to, you know, whatever, fix things
02:52:48 if they're bad.
02:52:49 Make no mistake.
02:52:50 This isn't for intergagement.
02:52:51 It just makes me feel good that I have made an impact, good, positive or negative.
02:52:57 I don't even know if the comments are good or bad, so I'm neutral, but I guess be good
02:53:00 if you want.
02:53:01 Typically, anything I release, I check comments for at least a day afterwards and the PCP,
02:53:05 it feels like comments from people who are assuming that no one's reading them.
02:53:10 Okay.
02:53:11 Okay.
02:53:12 Well, be advised people.
02:53:13 We've been saying, I do read the comments most weeks.
02:53:17 I do as well.
02:53:18 Yeah.
02:53:19 Well, there you go.
02:53:20 There you go.
02:53:21 Be good, ladies and gentlemen.
02:53:22 I don't think they're that bad, honestly.
02:53:23 I think they've improved a lot.
02:53:24 There's probably a couple of people out there listening who think, I always comment nice.
02:53:28 Okay.
02:53:29 Yeah, but it's not everybody.
02:53:30 Have a good night.
02:53:31 Bye.
02:53:32 We'll see you next week.
02:53:33 Bye.
02:53:34 Bye.
02:53:35 Bye.
02:53:36 Bye.
02:53:38 I'm supposed to be working right now.
02:53:43 I'm supposed to be working right now.
02:53:48 But I'm not working.
02:53:51 I'm doing nothing.
02:53:54 My dick, I'm jerking.
02:53:57 Myself, I'm sucking.
02:53:59 I am an asshole.
02:54:02 I am a stupid.
02:54:05 I've got a deadline.
02:54:07 Don't want to do it.
