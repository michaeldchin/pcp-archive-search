00:00:00 My volumetric intake is high and my volumetric output is low.
00:00:06 This is a calorie-rich environment for Mike Swimming.
00:00:11 For Mike Swimming?
00:00:12 Yeah, for Mike Swimming, the best swimmer in the world.
00:00:17 Mike Swimmer.
00:00:19 Mike Swimmer and Johnny just...
00:00:22 He's a Pokemon trainer too.
00:00:25 Yeah.
00:00:26 He has a... he has a Ramareya raid.
00:00:30 He's one of those weirdos who's got like a waterproof thing on his Pokemon Go phone.
00:00:36 Yeah.
00:00:37 He goes kayaking into buildings.
00:00:42 Into underwater buildings.
00:00:44 He crashes into them and he totals his boat.
00:00:47 He has a... a subnautical kayak.
00:00:54 With a little dome, he goes...
00:00:57 He just... he just has like a little like...
00:01:01 He just goes kayaking in like a deep sea dive or like a bell helmet.
00:01:06 Yes.
00:01:07 I mean he just... like he has the little paddle and he's just like... he's just like spinning it.
00:01:12 The way it works is like his... the sides of his kayak have little like him waterproof glove compartments
00:01:19 that you can put your hand in so he can move his arms around like a spaceman.
00:01:22 You feel like after all this important thing that he's like modded into his kayak,
00:01:26 he might as well just get out of the kayak and dive.
00:01:30 Wait, like... like that he's in the kayak.
00:01:33 Like the kayak is around his torso and like his little legs are sticking out the bottom
00:01:37 and he's just walking around in like this kayak.
00:01:44 They're like... no, no.
00:01:45 Okay.
00:01:46 Like he kayaks out to the sea.
00:01:48 Yeah.
00:01:49 And then... but then when he gets there, you know, he like puts on his helmet and like he goes into deep sea mode
00:01:54 and he just sticks his... sticks his feet through the bottom of the kayak
00:01:58 and then just like seals himself shut and just... just submerges.
00:02:02 So I can feel the purpose of crashing into underwater ruins.
00:02:07 What I... I assume you were going to say was he kayaks down and then he gets out of his kayak
00:02:12 in his underwater suit and then the kayak just floats to the top because it's got air in it.
00:02:18 It just leaves him behind.
00:02:20 How's he gonna get out of this situation?
00:02:24 He can't swim.
00:02:25 He's just gonna... he's just gonna put that to the front of his kayak through like the storefront
00:02:31 of like an old civilization.
00:02:35 The ancient Mayan burger place.
00:02:38 Exactly.
00:02:40 Oh, fucking Dave Kayak, you're so interesting.
00:02:44 Dave Kayak and Mike Swimmer.
00:02:47 Twin... twin emperors of New Mexico, Canada.
00:02:51 Very nice.
00:02:53 We will always remember you.
00:02:57 He left us to his suit in the kayak wars of 1983.
00:03:01 Wait, wait, it was... it was Mike Swimmer. Who was Kayak?
00:03:04 Oh, Dave Kayak.
00:03:05 Yeah, Dave Kayak.
00:03:07 That's the fusion. The fusion is Mike Kayak.
00:03:10 He died... he died the way he lived, ramming his kayak into an underwater ruin.
00:03:21 What an asshole, dude.
00:03:24 Yep, he really fucked it.
00:03:31 Okay, let's just play the fucking video game now.
00:03:35 Hello, welcome to the second and best rowdy fuckers cop killers, the movie starring me, Ben Sainte, and...
00:03:45 And Munchy.
00:03:46 And my nemesis Munchy, he's here.
00:03:48 He's here and he's larger than life.
00:03:50 Oh, Ben Sainte, I didn't destroy you last time, but I'm here to finish the job.
00:03:54 I have my guns, I have my grenades, I have all the things that you are weak to.
00:03:59 Those are not allowed in a Pokemon battle.
00:04:02 Oh, no, it's you.
00:04:04 It's Hippo.
00:04:05 And you're here.
00:04:06 I'm the rulesman.
00:04:07 I'm here to make sure it's a fair fight.
00:04:10 Hippo's here to adjudicate our grudge match.
00:04:13 I didn't prepare for this. Oh, no.
00:04:16 Who lives and who dies.
00:04:18 We're gonna settle this once and for all, Munchy.
00:04:21 It's been a long time coming.
00:04:23 You had free reign over this place for far too long.
00:04:26 I'm gonna fucking collar you and shackle you.
00:04:30 I'm gonna put you in the stocks in the front of town of our Old West town.
00:04:34 You're gonna fucking chain me underwater.
00:04:36 I'm just gonna have to burn there.
00:04:38 Yeah, anyway.
00:04:39 Paradoxically, because I'm underwater.
00:04:41 And I can't burn, but...
00:04:43 It's not gonna be pretty.
00:04:45 And the way I'm gonna do this to you is by utterly defeating you
00:04:48 in a series of Pokemon battles that we have decided upon.
00:04:52 That was my one weakness.
00:04:54 I thought that your weakness was guns, but I guess it was just video games.
00:04:58 I'm weak to guns and strong to Pokemon.
00:05:01 So since you started this fight, since you picked this fight,
00:05:04 I get to choose my weapon and it's Pokemon.
00:05:08 But actually, you're probably a lot better at Pokemon battling than me
00:05:13 because I've never fucking done this before.
00:05:15 I have never built a team or fought another human being.
00:05:19 My first Pokemon is Pokemon Goo.
00:05:22 Pokemon Goo?
00:05:26 Alright, the fan favorite of...
00:05:29 Let's go.
00:05:31 Alright, so the way it's gonna work is me and Munchy are gonna have three...
00:05:37 We're gonna have three sets of best out of three.
00:05:41 We're gonna fight with teams that we've...
00:05:44 I mean, I have painstakingly put this team together.
00:05:48 I have done research and crunched numbers and made spreadsheets
00:05:53 and the fruits of my labor.
00:05:55 I wish I was kidding.
00:05:58 The fruits of my labor are here
00:06:01 and we're gonna compete in the three different tiers.
00:06:04 Little Cup is gonna be first and Little Cup is for unevolved Pokemon.
00:06:07 It's for the weak bitches.
00:06:09 And then...
00:06:15 I'm gonna get you good for that one.
00:06:17 I'm gonna steam now. You activated my gamer rage.
00:06:21 I'm like that caterpillar in Mario that turns red.
00:06:25 You just stomped on me and now I'm red and I'm invincible.
00:06:29 You're fucked.
00:06:31 Okay, and then second is the underused tier for the pretty good kind of good Pokemon.
00:06:37 And then third is the ultimate championship, the overused tier, OU,
00:06:41 for the real super strong boys.
00:06:43 Not the strongest Uber tier.
00:06:45 Way too good for any reasonable battling tier.
00:06:48 But like the soap, the good enough, but not quite overpowered tier.
00:06:53 That's how it works for anyone that doesn't know about Pokemon.
00:06:57 Like I didn't like 3D.
00:06:59 I've also made myself a blanket of nails.
00:07:01 I will wrap around my body right now
00:07:03 and I will always have this on the entire time I play to improve my stimuli.
00:07:07 Is that gonna be like your held item as a Pokemon?
00:07:10 Like a nailed blanket?
00:07:12 Increases your Pokemon's suffering by 100%?
00:07:16 Well, see, relevant to nails, you know how you have the Benz Saint drink?
00:07:20 I decided to make my own drink.
00:07:22 And it's called the Munchie.
00:07:24 It's comprised of tic-tacs and nails.
00:07:28 And I blend them together and then I just drink it.
00:07:32 That wasn't the way there was a Benz Saint drink.
00:07:36 The Benz Saint is hot coffee.
00:07:39 Hot coffee and chocolate protein.
00:07:41 Oh yeah.
00:07:43 And you're tears because you're gonna cry once I'm done pummeling you with my fuck you.
00:07:49 I'm gonna kill you Munchie.
00:07:51 I'm not talking about this fight.
00:07:53 I'm not talking about Pokemon.
00:07:55 I'm going to come to your house and murder you.
00:07:57 I'll be waiting.
00:07:59 But let's not worry about that.
00:08:01 Yeah, alright.
00:08:03 Open the damn game so I can look at something.
00:08:07 Yeah, let's get it started.
00:08:11 So, let's have a look.
00:08:13 So Benz Saint, we got Porygon, we got Abro.
00:08:17 We got some little guy from Dragon Quest.
00:08:21 It's a mole from Dragon Quest.
00:08:23 It's Drillber, dude.
00:08:25 And we got Red Robin, Red Breast.
00:08:27 And that guy from an anime.
00:08:31 It's the monster from Undertale.
00:08:35 It is, it's the Undertale kid.
00:08:37 And we got a Kakun with spikes.
00:08:41 And on the other side we have...
00:08:43 Kakuna with spikes.
00:08:45 We have Munchie, he's a clown.
00:08:47 We got another Red Robin, we got another little kid.
00:08:51 We got Star Yu, that's the one.
00:08:55 We got Munchlax, which is his spirit animal.
00:08:59 We got a Kakun egg with spikes and a sword.
00:09:03 I'm gonna kill that sword.
00:09:05 They're all level 5.
00:09:07 You're not even gonna be able to fucking breathe.
00:09:09 Let the games begin.
00:09:11 Alright.
00:09:13 Now everyone knows that the entire battle is decided by who you send out first.
00:09:17 And everything else after that is just a formality.
00:09:21 So this is crucial, this is crucial here.
00:09:25 Got it.
00:09:27 Go, yellow bullet, mark two.
00:09:29 We both fucking protected each other.
00:09:31 We both knew we were gonna send out Farathorn.
00:09:33 You fucking bitch, you're not even cool dude.
00:09:35 Yeah, well I thought you had two steel types, so I thought I'd send out a fighting... anyway.
00:09:43 Yellow bullet, yeah right.
00:09:45 Like you think you're cool.
00:09:47 You're no match for my Juggalo.
00:09:49 They're staring each other down.
00:09:51 That's the only one I remember from Pokemon Stadium.
00:09:55 That's the only one.
00:09:57 I was gonna do more.
00:09:59 I think one of them is these Pokemon.
00:10:03 Whoa, he used knockoff.
00:10:05 And the other guy used knockoff as well.
00:10:09 God, we're so evenly fighting a critical hit, so I'm winning.
00:10:13 Yeah, it's true.
00:10:15 What's he gonna do?
00:10:17 What will he do?
00:10:19 Oh my fucking god!
00:10:21 I can't believe you went for that.
00:10:23 Why was yellow bullet faster than the other guy?
00:10:27 The other guy is cause the name.
00:10:31 Thank you.
00:10:33 It's a bullet speed.
00:10:35 Thank you.
00:10:37 This bird, which one?
00:10:39 Level 5.
00:10:41 What's he gonna do?
00:10:43 You know, I'm...
00:10:47 You're headband, what do you think I'm gonna do?
00:10:49 What do you think I'm gonna do, huh?
00:10:51 What do you think I'm gonna do?
00:10:53 Oh, I can switch sides, yeah.
00:10:55 I can't actually see what you're selecting or hogging over.
00:10:59 I can switch.
00:11:03 Oh god, I don't know.
00:11:05 I just don't know.
00:11:07 Alright.
00:11:09 Egg bullet.
00:11:11 Both of them are bullets.
00:11:13 Egg bullet, go!
00:11:15 The iron barbs hurt little bird.
00:11:17 This little bird is very small.
00:11:19 He's got thin legs.
00:11:21 Will he be able to actually, with the thin legs,
00:11:23 probably attack without getting hit by the spikes?
00:11:25 Oh, you're such a fool, dude.
00:11:27 You're such a fool.
00:11:29 You turn.
00:11:31 Dude, you don't even know who fucking brains are.
00:11:35 Oh, I like that you're a clown.
00:11:37 Do you see my little avatar?
00:11:39 Yeah, of course.
00:11:41 It's Munchie's mom's dildo.
00:11:43 Paralyzed instantly.
00:11:45 What happened?
00:11:47 Thunder wave.
00:11:49 Why can this egg use thunder wave?
00:11:51 It's an egg.
00:11:53 Look at his eyes.
00:11:55 It's level 5.
00:11:57 Look at the intensity of his eyes.
00:11:59 It's so stoned, dude.
00:12:01 Um, fuck.
00:12:03 Nah, fuck you, dude.
00:12:05 Whatever.
00:12:07 That's stupid.
00:12:09 Oh, he knocked off the item, which was something.
00:12:11 Stealth Rock.
00:12:13 I don't know anything about Pokémon.
00:12:15 The fuck is all of this?
00:12:17 Dude, I had never heard of none of the moves I'm using
00:12:19 on any of my Pokémon
00:12:21 I had ever heard of before this shit.
00:12:23 It's fake.
00:12:25 It's not real.
00:12:27 That's true.
00:12:29 Yeah, yep, yep, yep.
00:12:31 So they're both...
00:12:33 They're always getting out of there.
00:12:35 Come on, yellow bullet mark 2.
00:12:37 Show them how to die.
00:12:39 Always getting hurt quick and suddenly.
00:12:41 With bullets.
00:12:43 With bullets.
00:12:45 Drain punch.
00:12:47 Oh, he really drained that dildo
00:12:49 out of his action.
00:12:51 There's one ain't nothing.
00:12:53 Dude, you ain't fucking...
00:12:55 You ain't even heard of my bitch.
00:12:57 It's gonna be you, dude.
00:12:59 Whoa.
00:13:01 Nice.
00:13:03 Mmm.
00:13:05 Mmm.
00:13:07 Mmm.
00:13:09 Carl's junior.
00:13:11 Mmm.
00:13:13 Whoa, Starry has a little thing on his leg.
00:13:15 On the back of his leg.
00:13:17 I didn't know.
00:13:19 I was entranced.
00:13:21 He's not psychic type.
00:13:23 Yes, he is.
00:13:25 He's a psychic type.
00:13:27 He's junior.
00:13:29 You don't know shit.
00:13:31 That's true. Does he have a psychic move?
00:13:33 Guys.
00:13:35 What am I gonna do?
00:13:37 What is he gonna do?
00:13:39 I'm sure.
00:13:41 He's probably gonna use... wait, hang on.
00:13:43 Let's check this.
00:13:45 Psychic is ineffective against...
00:13:47 Put away your dictionary, Ben.
00:13:49 This is a war.
00:13:51 Dude, New World can't know.
00:13:53 Can't know anything?
00:13:55 Can't know.
00:13:57 Good.
00:13:59 Psychic is zero against...
00:14:01 What even is... oh, I can hover over the guy.
00:14:03 He's dark and fighting.
00:14:05 He doesn't look dark or fighting.
00:14:07 He looks like a little kid.
00:14:09 Oh, rapid spin, of course.
00:14:11 Who will I've been?
00:14:13 HB45% possible abilities.
00:14:15 Da-da-da-da.
00:14:17 I could have been looking at information this whole time, but I didn't.
00:14:21 I know what you're gonna do.
00:14:23 Oh, ah, shit.
00:14:25 It wasn't what I thought you'd do.
00:14:27 That's quite powerful.
00:14:29 This yellow bullet is punching like a...
00:14:31 Storm punches...
00:14:33 An old lady.
00:14:35 When she couldn't get inside quick enough.
00:14:37 Knockoff...
00:14:39 What kind of words you're saying?
00:14:41 Knockoff deals double damage against enemies that are holding an item.
00:14:43 So...
00:14:45 That's why it did all that.
00:14:47 Oh, you're done!
00:14:49 I can't believe you're hitting all these.
00:14:51 That's not how that works.
00:14:53 What is the hit rate?
00:14:55 It's 90% hit rate.
00:14:57 Man, this bird...
00:14:59 I know, but that's not how that works.
00:15:01 How can this bird stand up to a fucking jumping slice with a foot?
00:15:05 Speaking of jumping slice...
00:15:07 It's a sword.
00:15:09 It can slice him in half.
00:15:11 It gets you a bad idea.
00:15:13 Because they can punch me and swords are weak to people who have bones.
00:15:19 Oh, it's the little...
00:15:21 It's the mole of my hand.
00:15:23 Dirt bullet! Attack!
00:15:25 Oh, shit.
00:15:27 Oh, I've made a terrible mistake.
00:15:29 Yeah, you fucking retard.
00:15:31 Didn't you know birds can really borrow on the ground?
00:15:33 They're more powerful against ground.
00:15:35 Yeah, man.
00:15:37 That bird annihilated that mole.
00:15:39 He did.
00:15:41 Just like real nature.
00:15:43 What a terrible mistake.
00:15:47 You're fucking done. You are done.
00:15:49 You are done.
00:15:51 You've made the last mistake in your life, mister.
00:15:53 That's not true.
00:15:55 It's not true.
00:15:57 You've made the last mistake you'll ever make.
00:15:59 If he's made the last mistake, that means everything he does now will be a good idea.
00:16:03 Oh, no.
00:16:05 I did it!
00:16:07 I've... I...
00:16:09 Well, you know, I'd like to pretend that I predicted that, but I didn't.
00:16:11 It's Friends General.
00:16:15 I can't believe this.
00:16:17 He's super effective.
00:16:19 What are all these things?
00:16:21 0.67 times speed,
00:16:23 1.5...
00:16:25 Attack, 1.5 defense.
00:16:27 You're done, kid.
00:16:29 You're done. Use curse!
00:16:31 You just... you just sat on him.
00:16:33 That was also good.
00:16:41 Oh, here comes... here comes old yellow boy for backfraction.
00:16:45 Flying kick.
00:16:47 Attack.
00:16:49 Yeah, you know exactly. That's exactly right.
00:16:51 Ah, shit, I knew it.
00:16:55 I know. I know. I know. I know.
00:16:57 Birds can't... can't withstand a drop kick.
00:17:01 Especially small little babies.
00:17:03 You're so fast.
00:17:07 You're so fast.
00:17:09 I can't even see his movements.
00:17:11 Yeah, you do got this.
00:17:13 Don't away.
00:17:15 I've got... I've got fucking bones inside here.
00:17:17 He brought a knife to a Pokemon fight.
00:17:19 Yeah, that's what I thought.
00:17:21 That was the only thing I could do.
00:17:23 Using knockoff is really good because you always want items.
00:17:27 Knockoff is awesome.
00:17:31 I am fucked.
00:17:35 And the crowd goes...
00:17:39 And the crowd goes, uh, get on with it already.
00:17:43 Hey, I'm trying to fucking figure out.
00:17:45 He hasn't even used his Porygon yet.
00:17:47 He could use all of those.
00:17:49 He didn't.
00:17:51 Maybe he used it.
00:17:53 Oh, this looks like it's...
00:17:55 It's over for Munchy.
00:17:57 His little friend going to be beaten to death with one of them.
00:18:01 I can't believe you've hit Clyde at all of those.
00:18:03 Uh, yeah.
00:18:05 Well, it means 90%.
00:18:07 Dude, do you know...
00:18:09 Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's how that works.
00:18:11 You don't know how many times people have died in these very chairs that we sit in.
00:18:17 One point for Ben.
00:18:19 Bing!
00:18:21 Are you in?
00:18:23 Are you seeing my precious neon bullet?
00:18:25 Neon bullet.
00:18:27 Oh, the little leg's going this way and that way.
00:18:29 Yeah, yeah, man.
00:18:31 He's kicking like pretend footballs, one after the other.
00:18:35 That's his intimidation strategy.
00:18:37 Ah, shit.
00:18:39 So we're doing a rematch.
00:18:41 Now we've got Porygon vs. A knife.
00:18:43 Can physical...
00:18:45 Can Japanese steel...
00:18:47 ...steal slice a computer?
00:18:49 Fold it a thousand times.
00:18:51 I think I can...
00:18:53 I can't slice a fucking program in that.
00:18:59 I think I've seen this in an animal before.
00:19:03 You just gotta believe...
00:19:05 Yeah, what else people got seizures?
00:19:07 If you mix circuit boards in with your Japanese folded steel, you can slice computer programs.
00:19:13 That's what I know.
00:19:15 That doesn't fucking matter.
00:19:17 I don't care if I move last.
00:19:19 Oh, yeah, you're slow as fuck anyway.
00:19:21 Oh, no.
00:19:27 I wonder what my switch is.
00:19:29 Oh, look, it doesn't exist.
00:19:31 Oh, dear.
00:19:33 Okay, okay.
00:19:37 Ability download? Holy shit.
00:19:39 You could destroy my computer.
00:19:41 If I download something, I'll do it.
00:19:45 You could download a virus so that it looks like Ben won.
00:19:51 Yes.
00:19:52 It's Dirt Boy.
00:19:53 No!
00:19:55 Dirt Boy is worse than dirt.
00:19:57 That's why he digs it.
00:19:59 You act like something's gonna happen when in fact you know nothing will happen.
00:20:03 Oh fuck Shadow Sneak, I'm such an asshole.
00:20:07 You can't escape from the shank.
00:20:11 You can't be fucking gay, dude.
00:20:13 That's what I learned in college.
00:20:15 Yes, whatever you do, whatever you go in life, just please, for God's sake, don't be fucking gay, dude.
00:20:25 Okay, okay.
00:20:27 Will a knife stab up yellow bullet this time?
00:20:31 Will he be able to get the slice on him?
00:20:33 Look at that.
00:20:35 He's not even wearing plate armor.
00:20:37 Yes, oh no.
00:20:39 Oh, what?
00:20:41 I just wanted to, yeah, I got that crit, duh.
00:20:44 Why did you do that?
00:20:46 I wanted you to flinch, but I forgot I went fucking, shut up, dude.
00:20:53 Oh, he's getting flustered.
00:20:55 Now time for Carl.
00:20:57 Carlton.
00:20:59 Now time for Carl.
00:21:01 It is time for Carl.
00:21:03 Geez, I don't even know.
00:21:05 I don't even know what star you is.
00:21:07 Bubblebeam.
00:21:09 Is it a star or is it you?
00:21:11 Don't fucking check me out.
00:21:15 It's like that Austin Powers movie.
00:21:17 With those Asians.
00:21:21 Fuck you, fuck me.
00:21:23 You know?
00:21:25 We're all one big happy family.
00:21:27 Yeah.
00:21:29 Oh, fuck!
00:21:31 God damn it!
00:21:33 Something happened.
00:21:35 Yeah.
00:21:37 I fucking missed, dude.
00:21:39 I saw it.
00:21:41 High jump kit.
00:21:43 You avoid it and then something else happened.
00:21:45 What happened?
00:21:47 You'll never know unless you replay it.
00:21:49 Oh, he kept going and crashed.
00:21:51 That's the stakes of which you do with the jump and hop.
00:21:55 That's the push and pull of being gay.
00:21:59 If you jump up, you're gonna fall down.
00:22:01 But every time before, you can fall.
00:22:03 Of course, friend junior with the fire punch.
00:22:07 Out of the fucking nowhere.
00:22:09 You know what they say?
00:22:11 Fire is your best friend, junior.
00:22:13 Especially if you like to kill people.
00:22:17 Abracadabra?
00:22:19 What are these?
00:22:21 These are not even a thing.
00:22:23 Oh, that berry juice though.
00:22:27 Oh no, it's too powerful.
00:22:29 Big body.
00:22:31 Friend junior is the greatest person alive.
00:22:33 This is going in the complete opposite direction.
00:22:35 The greatest person alive, yeah.
00:22:39 Oh god, I don't know.
00:22:41 Friend junior is just too powerful.
00:22:43 He sent out his computer to fight Munchie's friend.
00:22:51 He tried to attack, but it didn't work.
00:22:53 That's it?
00:22:55 I'm fucked.
00:22:57 You're fucking gay, dude.
00:22:59 That's what you are.
00:23:01 Hey, whatever, man.
00:23:05 I'm so...
00:23:07 This text goes by way too fast for me to understand what's happening each time.
00:23:11 He's using his tri-times, two times.
00:23:13 Oh, he's gonna body slam me.
00:23:15 What? Wait, really?
00:23:17 I can't believe that.
00:23:19 Holy shit.
00:23:21 He could come back.
00:23:23 He could come back at any moment.
00:23:25 No, yeah, this is it.
00:23:29 This is it.
00:23:31 I also could do this.
00:23:33 Or maybe I'm gonna do this, bam!
00:23:35 Oh no, but he didn't.
00:23:37 I screamed.
00:23:39 The little bird, he's a red-rubbin' red breast.
00:23:41 He's used to the winter.
00:23:43 Oh no!
00:23:45 He sliced you, because he's seen many winters.
00:23:47 He knows the ice better than you do.
00:23:49 I'm...
00:23:51 Fuck you, dude.
00:23:53 Oh shit, it's mirror time.
00:23:55 Bird's first birds.
00:23:57 It's bird against bird.
00:23:59 It's a bird-fight bird world.
00:24:01 Uh...
00:24:03 Dear...
00:24:05 Maybe I'm faster.
00:24:07 I am.
00:24:09 Because of your ability, bitch.
00:24:11 Well, don't you have the same ability?
00:24:13 Yeah, it's true.
00:24:15 Oh shit, a bird comes up against an egg.
00:24:17 The next one...
00:24:19 There's a new bird in that egg.
00:24:21 I'm not sure if I have any
00:24:23 meaningfully useful
00:24:25 powers to do here.
00:24:29 If all else fails,
00:24:31 you can slice the bird in half
00:24:33 with a sword.
00:24:35 I'm gonna sweep him.
00:24:37 I'm gonna sweep Munchie's whole team
00:24:39 with bird bullet.
00:24:41 Bird bullet is gonna rip through...
00:24:43 Is a fucking paralyzed
00:24:45 little guy.
00:24:47 Oh no.
00:24:49 Oh no, he had an accident.
00:24:51 He had a little bird accident
00:24:53 and got paralyzed.
00:24:55 Oh shit, he's got times three attack.
00:24:57 That's like more than
00:24:59 about one. I just feel like this is fucking
00:25:01 bad for me. Hold on.
00:25:03 Yeah, it's bad for you.
00:25:05 Yeah, you're gonna die.
00:25:07 Yeah, your mom's gonna be real mad if
00:25:09 your dildos get broken and she can't
00:25:11 do what she's gonna do.
00:25:13 Hmm...
00:25:15 Hmm...
00:25:17 They're staring each other down.
00:25:19 Are you ready?
00:25:21 Are you prepared to die
00:25:23 right now? Oh dear.
00:25:25 Quick use big
00:25:27 fucking hit.
00:25:29 Nah, I think
00:25:31 he's got this actually.
00:25:33 No! No!
00:25:35 It didn't do it all.
00:25:37 It didn't do it all.
00:25:39 Come on bird bullet, please just overcome
00:25:41 your paralysis.
00:25:43 Like Kirito
00:25:45 in that show
00:25:47 that I've never seen
00:25:49 but that anime guy keeps talking about it.
00:25:51 That one guy.
00:25:53 That one Shella.
00:25:55 A knife versus a bird. I honestly don't know
00:25:57 which bird is quick.
00:25:59 If my paralysis
00:26:01 doesn't fuck me over again,
00:26:03 I think I win. Yeah, I think you do too.
00:26:05 Oh dear. Oh my,
00:26:07 oh me.
00:26:09 Oh, I did it!
00:26:11 I'm killing it! There it comes!
00:26:13 Here it fucking comes bro!
00:26:15 I can't believe this!
00:26:17 I did it!
00:26:19 I can't believe it!
00:26:21 I'm the champion of little cup!
00:26:23 He did it! He's the champion!
00:26:25 Fuck! Oh no!
00:26:27 I'm a disgrace.
00:26:29 Swords dance bird bullet.
00:26:31 That's all it took. A little bird killed
00:26:33 your whole family. How do you feel?
00:26:35 Oh well, I mean, I would like
00:26:37 to have my family back but obviously that's too...
00:26:39 It's too much.
00:26:41 Alright, now it's time for you, you.
00:26:43 Oh, should we have a little
00:26:45 interview, Ben? What do you think of that?
00:26:47 I think
00:26:49 that
00:26:51 I was...
00:26:53 I was, you know,
00:26:55 I didn't even try. Everything I said before
00:26:57 about making my team
00:26:59 really carefully
00:27:01 and making spreadsheets and crunching numbers
00:27:03 and doing hours and hours of research.
00:27:05 None of it was true. I just picked whatever.
00:27:07 I just went with what my heart told me.
00:27:09 You know what, paid off.
00:27:11 Are you in on this? Are you in this new fight?
00:27:13 Uh...
00:27:15 Basketball vs. Monotype.
00:27:17 Oh no, Bensate vs. Munchie. There we go.
00:27:19 Basketball?
00:27:21 Basketball and Monotype.
00:27:23 Alright, let's go through this team.
00:27:25 We got, we got
00:27:27 Play-Doh coming out of one of those things.
00:27:29 We got Blastoise.
00:27:31 We got Catgirl.
00:27:33 We got that thing for this.
00:27:35 It's a boy, thank you very much.
00:27:37 Okay, it's the onion from that movie.
00:27:39 We got Big Crocker Boy.
00:27:41 He's gonna bite you, slice you
00:27:43 with very small eyes.
00:27:45 And Snorlax,
00:27:47 because he's fat.
00:27:49 And then, on the other teams.
00:27:51 We got a very tall
00:27:53 Pikachu.
00:27:55 We got
00:27:57 Brunswink.
00:27:59 We got...
00:28:01 What the fuck is that? This is like a slicey moon.
00:28:03 It's like that one enemy
00:28:05 from the moon in Dark Cloud.
00:28:07 You know the one. Nobody knows the one.
00:28:09 Sailor Moon.
00:28:11 Yeah, Sailor Moon, that's the one.
00:28:13 Then we got, oh, it's a bunch of
00:28:15 roses. It's a bouquet.
00:28:17 And now we got two swords.
00:28:19 He's got extra swords this time.
00:28:21 I agree, Florgis.
00:28:23 Florgis is gross.
00:28:25 And we got Crobat, because, you know,
00:28:27 nobody likes Crobat.
00:28:29 Because whatever, I didn't care
00:28:31 about that last slot.
00:28:33 Crobat is actually the key to this
00:28:35 entire...
00:28:37 Oh, I see.
00:28:39 I see.
00:28:41 I see.
00:28:43 What do you think?
00:28:45 Which Pokemon will you play?
00:28:47 Will they play which Pokemon?
00:28:49 Go!
00:28:51 Beef Bullet!
00:28:53 I like how you didn't fucking go for it.
00:28:55 What did you think I was gonna go for?
00:28:57 Spaghetti versus
00:28:59 Big Pig.
00:29:01 Let's have a look. We got Bug Rock.
00:29:03 So it's gross.
00:29:05 That's what it is. And we got Ice Ground.
00:29:07 So he's gonna...
00:29:09 He's gonna...
00:29:11 I don't know what he's gonna do.
00:29:13 I got the defense. I got
00:29:15 the offense. I got the fucking
00:29:17 beans. I have the beans in my hair.
00:29:19 Oh shit, this Bug Rock has Hyper Beam.
00:29:23 Don't say that.
00:29:25 It's got Hyper Beam, dude.
00:29:27 Yeah, dude, you fucking piece of shit.
00:29:29 I got a little Bug have Hyper Beam.
00:29:31 Wait, does he actually...
00:29:33 You're not supposed to tell me...
00:29:35 I can't tell you what they have.
00:29:37 I'm gay as written on your ceiling. Did you write that in your sleep?
00:29:39 Cause that's what your concess was
00:29:41 telling you?
00:29:43 Let me just look up real quick
00:29:45 and confirm that.
00:29:47 Oh shit.
00:29:49 Big Pig used Earthquake.
00:29:51 Cause he's...
00:29:53 You fool. You absolute...
00:29:55 You absolute monster.
00:29:57 He actually did it.
00:29:59 Shut up.
00:30:01 Oh god, you...
00:30:03 You need to use a...
00:30:05 What's the moss from Dark Cloud? Dark Souls?
00:30:07 The moss?
00:30:09 What are you?
00:30:11 No, the green moss is not green moss.
00:30:13 It's like purple or whatever.
00:30:15 My game was crashed.
00:30:17 Oh really?
00:30:19 Oh, it's crashed for me too.
00:30:21 Oh...
00:30:23 You wanna just start a new one
00:30:25 and do exactly what we did?
00:30:27 Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's do that.
00:30:29 That seems...
00:30:31 Okay, we'll just get it right back to where we were.
00:30:33 We're doing a big old Swifty Do.
00:30:35 Uh, here's something.
00:30:37 Alright, well let's do the half-time show.
00:30:39 Yeah.
00:30:41 Put in like a little...
00:30:43 Put in like a...
00:30:45 I'll put in music.
00:30:47 And a gif. That'll be the half-time show.
00:30:49 And then we could be the guys in the box saying...
00:30:51 Well that wasn't...
00:30:53 Well that was not a fucking...
00:30:55 Well, well, well...
00:30:57 He passed the ball...
00:30:59 And he scored, but will he do it again?
00:31:01 What do you think?
00:31:03 I don't care.
00:31:05 He is gay.
00:31:07 That's why he's playing football.
00:31:09 Oh...
00:31:11 Football's gay.
00:31:13 Damn...
00:31:15 Damn, you can't just say that.
00:31:17 On TV.
00:31:19 TV?
00:31:21 Internet v...
00:31:23 Oh, no.
00:31:25 Internet vision.
00:31:27 You have it, I have it.
00:31:29 But will they accept it?
00:31:31 No.
00:31:33 It's the onset.
00:31:35 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
00:31:41 I had to think for a second.
00:31:43 But the seconds are weaknesses.
00:31:45 You see when my mom taught me...
00:31:47 If you told me one thing, it was this.
00:31:49 You always steal.
00:31:51 You have to steal.
00:31:53 And we're back.
00:31:55 There was a technical hip-skilly,
00:31:57 and now we're just re...
00:31:59 We're redoing the past.
00:32:01 Hopefully there won't be any random changes
00:32:03 in what happened.
00:32:05 Now, okay, we're back.
00:32:07 Okay, now we're back exactly where we were.
00:32:09 We got a toxic pig.
00:32:11 We got a spaghetti earthquake...
00:32:13 I hate sex so much.
00:32:15 Spaghetti.
00:32:17 I feel like going. I have to say it.
00:32:19 I hate sex.
00:32:21 Shit!
00:32:23 That reminds me of a drill tweet recently.
00:32:25 It said,
00:32:27 quote,
00:32:29 history will show that leaving the EU
00:32:31 was the right move for Britain.
00:32:33 And also,
00:32:35 I don't believe in sex.
00:32:37 Signed the Brexit asexual.
00:32:41 God fucking dammit!
00:32:43 I...
00:32:45 What?
00:32:47 Ooh!
00:32:49 Coming or coming out.
00:32:51 Black and red, like my friends.
00:32:53 All my friends.
00:32:55 He's ground and dark, he's dark-
00:32:57 Don't say that!
00:32:59 And...
00:33:01 He got hit with a carbon-earthquake
00:33:03 and he killed him.
00:33:05 He killed him, it's fine.
00:33:07 Well, it's not fine for you.
00:33:09 God, that was terrible.
00:33:11 What an awful exchange.
00:33:13 Why do you mix me and want to touch a little kid?
00:33:15 Well, that really hurts my feelings
00:33:17 and also harasses me.
00:33:19 Um...
00:33:21 I think you're probably...
00:33:23 What if you get off to touch your kids now?
00:33:25 Yeah, appropriately.
00:33:27 One time I rub against someone
00:33:29 in the subway station and I'm pretty sure
00:33:31 they called me a Jew.
00:33:35 There we go.
00:33:37 Well, that is a terrifying screech
00:33:39 of a fucking bouquet.
00:33:41 Uh-huh.
00:33:43 It's just like a rosary.
00:33:45 It's like a rosary of evolution.
00:33:47 It's like a rosetta stone.
00:33:51 You nerd.
00:33:53 It knows Japans.
00:33:55 You friggin' nerd, Munchin.
00:33:57 I forgot.
00:33:59 It knows how I'm going.
00:34:01 I forgot how the ground is-
00:34:03 You forgot about fairy types?
00:34:05 The best type?
00:34:07 Oh no.
00:34:09 Big fat friend or...
00:34:11 It's not fucking fairy anymore.
00:34:13 He grew up into normal friend.
00:34:15 Friend was my father's name.
00:34:17 Call me... Jimmy.
00:34:21 Moonbyist.
00:34:23 That's what you call an average attack.
00:34:25 It's sort of effective.
00:34:27 But...
00:34:29 Snorlax has got like a million hit-pins.
00:34:31 Hit-pins.
00:34:33 Hit-pins.
00:34:35 I've got a million pints, dude.
00:34:37 Oh shit, he's got an item.
00:34:39 What?
00:34:41 Oh, it's the U.S. government.
00:34:45 It is the U.S. government.
00:34:47 I can't wait to destroy it.
00:34:49 I can't wait to just tear it apart and dismantle it.
00:34:51 Who will win? Flowers or authority?
00:34:53 Oh my god.
00:34:55 Yeah.
00:34:57 It's like the 60s all over again.
00:34:59 They put in the flowers in the barrels of the guns.
00:35:01 I don't know what...
00:35:03 Is that super effective or not?
00:35:05 I don't know what Celebi is for.
00:35:09 For gay rights.
00:35:11 Or...
00:35:13 Is for...
00:35:15 In the morning.
00:35:19 Baton pass.
00:35:21 Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.
00:35:23 Oh dear.
00:35:27 Just when you thought being gay wasn't bad enough,
00:35:29 you had to throw in...
00:35:31 Being extra gay.
00:35:33 Extra gay.
00:35:35 The new product from...
00:35:37 Pokemon The Gay Company.
00:35:39 I know exactly what to do.
00:35:41 You are stupid.
00:35:43 No! Fuck!
00:35:45 You are stupid.
00:35:47 Shut up!
00:35:49 Did you know I was going to do that?
00:35:51 Yeah, of course.
00:35:53 What else did you do?
00:35:55 Dude, he's going to use an old type attack.
00:35:57 Dude!
00:35:59 You steel ghost.
00:36:01 Son of a fucking bitch.
00:36:03 You set me up, Munchie!
00:36:05 You fucking set me up!
00:36:09 I'm going to fucking kill you, bro.
00:36:11 I'm going to kill you, bro.
00:36:13 I'm going to kill you, bro.
00:36:15 He's ready.
00:36:17 I'm going to shoot you with sword bullet, right?
00:36:19 Fucking now! No! How are you so fast?
00:36:21 I'm deceptively fast.
00:36:25 Oh boy.
00:36:27 It's really getting heated.
00:36:29 This is it for me.
00:36:31 There's no coming back.
00:36:33 That's a fiery heating punch.
00:36:37 How can I stop this?
00:36:39 How can I stop, friend?
00:36:41 How can I stop this?
00:36:43 How can I stop, friend?
00:36:45 I killed friend Junior.
00:36:47 That friend is here for revenge.
00:36:49 No!
00:36:51 Oh!
00:36:53 He's burned.
00:36:55 It's leftovers won't do shit now.
00:36:57 They get burned away.
00:36:59 That's not true, though.
00:37:01 No!
00:37:05 All you got to do is start believing in fairy tales.
00:37:07 Because I'm a fairy tale.
00:37:09 And you're about to be my tale.
00:37:13 I'm going to fucking grind you into the paste that you are.
00:37:15 You are a pasty white boy.
00:37:17 And I'm going to rape you.
00:37:19 Because I'm black.
00:37:21 And that's what we do.
00:37:23 Munchie, please. Please.
00:37:25 Just have mercy.
00:37:27 Oh, God.
00:37:29 Aspene, fire punch.
00:37:31 This is a, surely a,
00:37:33 clearly a match.
00:37:35 This is clearly a match.
00:37:37 This is clearly, definitely a match.
00:37:39 It's a match between two people.
00:37:41 A neck?
00:37:43 Maybe you should switch into your ground type.
00:37:45 Oh, wait, he's dead.
00:37:49 That burn will kill him.
00:37:51 That burn will kill him.
00:37:53 But not before
00:37:55 sealing my victory.
00:37:57 Is that, like, a thing
00:37:59 where you're going to bring out a seal?
00:38:01 Ah, shit.
00:38:03 Ah, whatever.
00:38:05 Ah, god damn it.
00:38:07 Spaghetti vs. the moon.
00:38:09 I just want to be, I just want to be extra
00:38:11 careful, so let me just give this to you.
00:38:15 I just want to be extra careful.
00:38:17 Let me just give you this to you guys.
00:38:19 Let me just give this to you guys.
00:38:21 He's going to protect Stovework
00:38:23 and I'll talk to him.
00:38:25 So I can, you know,
00:38:27 you know how it be.
00:38:29 This is an intense battle.
00:38:33 Fucking neck bullet.
00:38:37 Neck bullet.
00:38:39 I love neck bullet and neck bullet mark, too.
00:38:41 How does he shoot his neck
00:38:43 without killing himself?
00:38:45 Well,
00:38:47 he's a long guy.
00:38:49 He is the bullet. He's just comprised
00:38:51 largely of neck.
00:38:53 Where does it end?
00:38:55 It's a girl.
00:38:57 Oh, fuck this.
00:38:59 Why did I like girls on my team? That's why I'm losing.
00:39:01 That's why I'm losing this fight.
00:39:03 You're going for the Pokémon
00:39:05 that arouses you more than the Pokémon
00:39:07 that will save your life.
00:39:09 This Pokémon arouses me just fine. Thank you very much.
00:39:11 Thank you very much.
00:39:15 He does have a very, he does have
00:39:17 an infectious smile.
00:39:19 Oh, no.
00:39:21 I've made a terrible mistake
00:39:23 over and over again.
00:39:25 That's what life is all about.
00:39:27 For you.
00:39:29 Oh, of course he is protect.
00:39:31 Munchy.
00:39:33 Oh, that burn. That burn will do it.
00:39:35 He's sticky webbed.
00:39:37 He's rocked. He's burned.
00:39:39 He needs a nice hot bath, but he doesn't have one.
00:39:41 No!
00:39:43 Oh, yes!
00:39:45 I can't believe this.
00:39:47 I can't believe this.
00:39:49 That's what old Hammurabi told me
00:39:51 when he fucking killed me.
00:39:53 It's kind of close.
00:39:55 It's kind of close when she has one extra Pokémon,
00:39:57 but it's already damaged.
00:40:01 What will Ben do?
00:40:03 What will he...
00:40:05 If he's smart, yeah, and if he's smart
00:40:07 then he'll fall right into my trap
00:40:09 and he's a trap.
00:40:11 No, come on, though.
00:40:15 Yeah, you fell right into my trap, buddy.
00:40:17 Oh, shit.
00:40:19 Well...
00:40:21 You can't not psychic a bat.
00:40:23 That's what they always say.
00:40:25 And you're going to try and do what you think is right,
00:40:27 but you're going to be wrong.
00:40:29 Because I also know what you're going to do right now.
00:40:31 Oh, my God.
00:40:33 Are you scaring me?
00:40:35 You see,
00:40:37 when God created me, he said,
00:40:39 all right, I was having fun
00:40:41 with my Play-Doh game people,
00:40:43 and I thought it was going to be funny,
00:40:45 but this prank has gotten out of control,
00:40:47 and I need you to undo my gamer prank.
00:40:49 That's right.
00:40:51 Oh, I see.
00:40:53 That's neck bullet one.
00:40:55 Correct.
00:40:57 It's big Pikachu.
00:40:59 The evolved form of Pikachu.
00:41:01 No!
00:41:03 Oh, what?
00:41:05 That electric wasn't even good.
00:41:07 Time to bring out the...
00:41:09 It's like you think that you're cool.
00:41:11 It's almost like that.
00:41:13 It's a ring around the rosies.
00:41:15 It's almost like that you think you're cool.
00:41:17 Because the rosies are in the ring.
00:41:19 Foolish.
00:41:21 What a mistake.
00:41:23 I can't...
00:41:25 What a mistake.
00:41:27 We're just...
00:41:29 There we go. That's all I needed.
00:41:31 That fucking minus special defense.
00:41:33 No, come on.
00:41:35 Don't...
00:41:37 Don't fuck around with me, though.
00:41:39 Yes!
00:41:41 I'll kill you.
00:41:43 I'll kill you, though.
00:41:45 Here, I'm going to keep them for can fodder.
00:41:47 No lie.
00:41:49 Dammit! God fucking dammit!
00:41:51 That's no lie.
00:41:53 He used protect against nothing.
00:41:55 I don't know what I'm doing anymore.
00:41:57 We'll smiley face punch him.
00:41:59 Will he win?
00:42:01 Also, I hate florgas.
00:42:03 Oh, he's toxic.
00:42:05 You're dead, boy.
00:42:07 You don't have anti-dote.
00:42:11 Oh, I'm...
00:42:13 I'm terrible.
00:42:15 This whole battle has just been one mistake after another.
00:42:17 I don't care if Shuckle fucking dies.
00:42:19 Who cares about Shuckle?
00:42:21 Nobody, that's who.
00:42:23 We got three Pokemon each.
00:42:25 It's an even match.
00:42:27 Kind of even...
00:42:29 Digimon.
00:42:31 Digimon.
00:42:33 Here he comes with his big attack.
00:42:35 You fucking nerd!
00:42:37 You fucking nerd, are you serious?
00:42:39 I forgot.
00:42:41 Did you really just do that?
00:42:43 Did you really fucking just use
00:42:45 Dragon Pulse on fucking florgas?
00:42:47 I forgot.
00:42:49 You infinite bastard.
00:42:51 You're a fucking...
00:42:53 What? Holy shit.
00:42:55 You fucking retard. I'm still going to win even though I'm gay.
00:42:57 Maybe I spoke too soon.
00:42:59 Listen, you can't judge someone
00:43:01 just based on their sexuality, alright?
00:43:03 Wait, what?
00:43:05 I can't.
00:43:07 Damn.
00:43:09 You can get most of the information.
00:43:11 If there's one thing I know
00:43:13 it's that being who you are
00:43:15 is not...
00:43:17 It's wrong.
00:43:19 Agreed.
00:43:21 Oh, that special defense is really...
00:43:25 Okay, I know what to do.
00:43:27 Oh, you didn't let me do it though.
00:43:29 Okay, shit.
00:43:31 Oh, shit.
00:43:33 I think it's gonna die.
00:43:35 It's not gonna go...
00:43:39 What even is aura sphere?
00:43:41 Is it a physical psychic?
00:43:43 Or is it a special fighting?
00:43:45 It's a special fighting.
00:43:47 I think you can do it now.
00:43:49 You have faith in me? Come on, bad bull.
00:43:51 Yeah, roost! Yeah, roost!
00:43:53 Oh, keep roostin'!
00:43:55 Roost all the time.
00:43:57 Roost Bolton.
00:44:01 There we go.
00:44:03 Is that what you were looking for, you son of a bitch?
00:44:05 He's bored.
00:44:07 Oh, I didn't mean to do that one,
00:44:09 but it doesn't matter anyway.
00:44:11 Doesn't it?
00:44:13 No, it doesn't.
00:44:15 You're just gonna keep...
00:44:17 I think, Ben,
00:44:19 the amount of healing you're gonna need to do...
00:44:21 No, look at that. I'm making progress.
00:44:23 Oh, yeah?
00:44:25 Don't even fucking try with this dragon pulse.
00:44:27 It could go either way.
00:44:29 Oh, bad bullet.
00:44:31 Oh, bad bullet.
00:44:33 Oh, bad bullet.
00:44:35 Bad bullet.
00:44:37 You can do this all day, dude.
00:44:39 I can do this all day.
00:44:41 But you're gonna have to damage me eventually,
00:44:43 and that's when you're gonna die.
00:44:45 Hang on, how much... Roost has 10 out of 16s.
00:44:47 That's a lot of roosting you can do.
00:44:51 Shit, I can only roost 10 more times.
00:44:53 I'm gonna need at least 100 for this plan to work.
00:44:55 Shit.
00:44:57 It's more than 5, sir.
00:44:59 As soon as he gets a crit,
00:45:01 it's over.
00:45:05 Yeah, dude.
00:45:07 You got this under control.
00:45:13 I've been waiting my whole life for this battle.
00:45:21 Oh, man.
00:45:23 That's sick.
00:45:25 Just end me.
00:45:27 Please.
00:45:29 Please put me out of my misery, Munchy.
00:45:33 Alright, now I've had enough.
00:45:35 I've had enough. You got this one.
00:45:37 Okay, I've had enough.
00:45:39 I'm gonna give you this one, Munchy.
00:45:41 Oh, yeah.
00:45:43 I'm gonna let you have this one.
00:45:45 You deserve it.
00:45:47 One point for Munchy
00:45:49 towards this round.
00:45:51 Alright, rematch.
00:45:53 Let's not mess around.
00:45:55 Yeah, let's take this one
00:45:57 seriously, though.
00:45:59 Yeah, for real, for real.
00:46:01 Absolutely, 100%.
00:46:05 Oh, dear.
00:46:07 It started off with a superb effective.
00:46:09 I forgot about moves.
00:46:13 Only you remembered that the video games
00:46:15 were not catered to retards.
00:46:17 Yeah, I wish I could remember that.
00:46:19 I wish I could remember that.
00:46:21 But, you know...
00:46:23 When Shigeru Miyamoto
00:46:25 first swore...
00:46:27 No, god damn it! Why?
00:46:29 When it just happened, it was a shadow boy.
00:46:31 And you got superb effective.
00:46:33 When he first set foot on the moon,
00:46:35 he said, from this day forward,
00:46:37 I will not, if you do games,
00:46:39 will be minority repellent.
00:46:41 Thank god for that.
00:46:45 Oh, no, this is...
00:46:47 Is that what they said in the minority report?
00:46:49 Oh, that's what they said
00:46:51 in, uh...
00:46:53 last week, tonight, with John Oliver.
00:46:55 When he was interviewed.
00:47:01 Are you just gonna have all your guys get damaged
00:47:03 and then go home?
00:47:05 Yeah, sure.
00:47:07 Why not?
00:47:09 This trap...
00:47:11 is trapping you good.
00:47:13 It may be paralyzed and a boy.
00:47:15 And act like you know how things are.
00:47:19 You act like you know what things are,
00:47:21 except you don't.
00:47:23 I know one or two things.
00:47:25 Can beef boy kill the trap?
00:47:27 Find out.
00:47:29 Well, I don't know if you know if you realize,
00:47:31 but he's a trap because it's a girl,
00:47:33 but it's not.
00:47:35 And that's why it's a trap.
00:47:37 I know what that trap is.
00:47:39 You just want to put your doll in it,
00:47:41 and then you realize, where do you put it?
00:47:43 Well, you realize
00:47:45 that there's a wonderful thing called boy pussy.
00:47:49 Alright, take that out of the video.
00:47:51 Wait, no, what is that?
00:47:53 Tell me about that.
00:47:55 I'm wondering.
00:47:57 Take that out of the video.
00:47:59 I'm the one who has the footage.
00:48:01 I can edit it all day.
00:48:03 Both of you look like the coolest guys
00:48:05 with their boy pussy.
00:48:07 Yeah.
00:48:11 Uh, let's...
00:48:13 Let's try something radical.
00:48:15 No, no, you're not.
00:48:17 Let's try something radical.
00:48:21 That's pretty radical.
00:48:23 Shoot that bat with your gun.
00:48:27 It's Digimon.
00:48:29 Oh shit, electric.
00:48:31 Can you Thunder Shock Big Blue?
00:48:33 Yeah.
00:48:35 Maybe.
00:48:37 Amphor off the slowest fuck though, dude.
00:48:39 Um...
00:48:41 Yeah, well...
00:48:43 So...
00:48:45 So what though?
00:48:47 What was that?
00:48:49 It didn't do anything.
00:48:51 It got rid of the stealth rock.
00:48:53 What the hell's the stealth...
00:48:55 Dude.
00:48:57 The greatest commenter of all time.
00:48:59 What the hell's the stealth rock?
00:49:03 I don't know.
00:49:05 I'm here to provide moral support
00:49:07 for me and no one else.
00:49:09 People have laid a clever trap
00:49:11 and megablastoise.
00:49:13 Dude, look at my eyes.
00:49:15 You think my eyes can see?
00:49:17 Fuck you, I'm blind, dude.
00:49:19 How can our eyes be real
00:49:21 if we can't even see?
00:49:23 Exactly.
00:49:25 How can the sea be real if we can't see?
00:49:27 The sea.
00:49:29 That's true.
00:49:31 A.
00:49:35 Don't even fucking try it.
00:49:37 You're stupid and it won't work.
00:49:41 Oh, for God's...
00:49:43 Oh, please. Oh, no.
00:49:45 Okay.
00:49:47 Wait, it's Wish?
00:49:49 That's cute. He wished that his sword buddy
00:49:51 would come and save its own life with health.
00:49:53 And he did.
00:49:55 He's alive.
00:49:57 Oh, that wasn't good enough.
00:49:59 The sword danced.
00:50:03 I've really...
00:50:05 I've really fucked up.
00:50:07 Oh, dear.
00:50:09 Try this one for size.
00:50:11 He's got times three.
00:50:13 Try this one for size.
00:50:15 Oh, sacred sword!
00:50:17 Ooh, that's good.
00:50:19 No.
00:50:21 No!
00:50:23 Sadistic is not going to work, by the way.
00:50:25 I hope you realize.
00:50:27 Yeah, I do.
00:50:29 I know ghosts.
00:50:31 I know ghosts.
00:50:33 I ain't afraid no ghosts.
00:50:35 I am.
00:50:37 They are real.
00:50:39 And they're real.
00:50:41 The one time I saw a ghost and I said,
00:50:43 Dude, why do you do this to people?
00:50:45 And they said, I just want to be loved.
00:50:47 And I cried.
00:50:49 And they said, you know what, I'm going to write a story about this.
00:50:51 I'm going to post it on a creepypasta.wiki.
00:50:53 And I'm going to get a lot of updates.
00:50:55 God, I can help you become famous on the internet.
00:50:57 That's what I wanted to do.
00:50:59 My name was Ben St.
00:51:01 And he never got famous on the internet.
00:51:03 And he became a ghost and he went back in time.
00:51:05 And that's who I met.
00:51:07 Munchie, you know what?
00:51:09 Before, I was debating whether I should
00:51:11 Swords Dance or Shadow Sneak.
00:51:13 And if I had Swords Dance,
00:51:15 then that fucking sacred sword would have killed friend.
00:51:17 And I would be home free.
00:51:19 God fucking dammit.
00:51:21 The whole match was decided right there by not
00:51:23 Swords Dancing.
00:51:25 Shit.
00:51:27 You really screwed the pooch on this one.
00:51:29 I sure did.
00:51:31 You guys
00:51:33 are better at commentating your own match
00:51:35 than I am.
00:51:37 We actually know what our Pokemon are doing.
00:51:39 The text goes
00:51:41 by too fast so all I can do is go
00:51:43 eh.
00:51:45 You know?
00:51:47 That's all we need, dude.
00:51:49 I lifted one weight yesterday
00:51:51 and my arm is like broken.
00:51:53 Nice.
00:51:55 Was it one kilogram?
00:51:57 It was one centimeter.
00:51:59 That's very dense.
00:52:01 Just like
00:52:03 someone.
00:52:05 I want to insult someone
00:52:07 but can't decide so
00:52:09 I'll just leave it up to interpretation.
00:52:13 Fuck.
00:52:15 Bitch. Ass.
00:52:17 You act like you know what shit happens
00:52:19 and you don't know how shit happens.
00:52:21 You just know that you are a little boy.
00:52:23 Chomp his neck. Chomp his neck.
00:52:25 You've got the teeth, I think.
00:52:27 No!
00:52:29 God, it read me like a fucking book.
00:52:33 Read you like a
00:52:35 bestseller.
00:52:37 Jesus.
00:52:39 Jesus.
00:52:41 Dude.
00:52:43 You don't even know how weirds are.
00:52:45 Can Kamina eat roses?
00:52:47 I don't think he's a vegetarian.
00:52:49 I think,
00:52:51 yeah, you need that guy.
00:52:53 He is a vegetarian.
00:52:57 Or is he a vegetable?
00:52:59 He is. He's gross.
00:53:01 Find out next time.
00:53:03 On the next episode of
00:53:05 Dagen
00:53:07 Dragon.
00:53:09 Dragon Kid Boy.
00:53:11 You know what's called
00:53:13 Dragon Ball Z
00:53:15 because he went through
00:53:17 26
00:53:19 drafts
00:53:21 and the first one was Dragon Ball A
00:53:23 and it wasn't very good so he did it again.
00:53:25 Well see,
00:53:27 what you gotta understand about Dragon Ball
00:53:29 that was made by a crazy man.
00:53:31 A crazy man
00:53:33 in a cave and that guy
00:53:35 was just up to no good.
00:53:41 Hmm.
00:53:43 Let me get out the damage calculator here.
00:53:45 Pokemon is
00:53:47 boring.
00:53:49 Right?
00:53:51 I was about to yawn really loud
00:53:53 but then I stopped.
00:53:55 Damage calculator.
00:53:57 A little bit of good indicator of my current feelings.
00:53:59 Just kill the swords or something.
00:54:03 Use your brain powers
00:54:05 and your psychic.
00:54:11 Use the death note.
00:54:13 You can see his name.
00:54:15 No, that's not gonna fucking kill me, faggot.
00:54:19 Yeah, you think you're cool, dude.
00:54:21 God.
00:54:23 Damn it.
00:54:25 See, you just gotta have to
00:54:27 you have to see with your mind's eye, dude.
00:54:29 I forgot my bat boy
00:54:31 is so dead.
00:54:33 Nope.
00:54:35 That doesn't matter.
00:54:37 I'm special.
00:54:39 You sure are, man.
00:54:41 I'm special, though.
00:54:43 You used U-turn.
00:54:45 Which means
00:54:47 Pikachu's here.
00:54:49 Get some nice free damage there.
00:54:51 They're going once.
00:54:53 Going twice.
00:54:55 It's souls to
00:54:57 US government.
00:54:59 Oh, no.
00:55:03 That crocodile's cry
00:55:05 sounds like her beginning of a rock song.
00:55:07 It sounds cool.
00:55:11 Oh.
00:55:13 You dummy.
00:55:17 Oh.
00:55:19 I've been completely outclassed.
00:55:29 Ah, shit.
00:55:31 Yeah, I'm not gonna...
00:55:33 No.
00:55:35 I like how that was resisted, by the way.
00:55:37 Nope.
00:55:41 Hey, you did something
00:55:43 with your life.
00:55:45 I fucking did it.
00:55:47 Shit.
00:55:49 It's 2 vs 4.
00:55:51 Yeah, 2 vs 4.
00:55:53 Friend
00:55:55 is a...
00:55:57 It jumps really high.
00:55:59 I'm a little...
00:56:01 It's kind of like when you
00:56:03 fall into the flower bed.
00:56:05 You're doing fucking this shit.
00:56:07 I wish
00:56:09 you had knocked off my left over.
00:56:11 She worked really hard on those flowers.
00:56:13 You can't just roll around on them.
00:56:15 So that's why it didn't work.
00:56:17 And it was protected by the mother
00:56:19 of friend.
00:56:21 That's the lore behind that
00:56:23 attack.
00:56:25 So this is what we're doing, huh?
00:56:27 Yeah, this is your fucking
00:56:29 doing.
00:56:31 It's almost like
00:56:33 I'm your parent, so I'm disappointed in you.
00:56:39 I forgot that you had one.
00:56:41 The fact is that you had another Pokémon.
00:56:43 Oh, you got a wish.
00:56:45 And is he gonna do more?
00:56:47 Is he gonna do more health getting?
00:56:49 Was he a doctor?
00:56:51 Doctor bullet?
00:56:53 Doctor bat?
00:56:55 Come to bat? Go to bat with a doctor?
00:56:57 What is he doing?
00:56:59 He's gonna stab you
00:57:01 with his U-turn.
00:57:03 And run away.
00:57:05 I'm not letting
00:57:07 this match go. I can't.
00:57:09 I just can't let it go.
00:57:11 There you
00:57:13 got that, dude.
00:57:15 This fucking flower
00:57:17 is tough as nails.
00:57:19 But not as hard as nails, because it's a
00:57:21 grass and, well, it's not made of
00:57:23 grass, it's a fairy.
00:57:25 But it is made of grass, I think.
00:57:27 But that doesn't mean it's a grass type.
00:57:29 How does it not mean it's a grass type?
00:57:31 I don't get it. But the fuck is a fairy?
00:57:35 We got wings.
00:57:37 We got little
00:57:39 feminine
00:57:41 wings. Damn!
00:57:43 You're just gonna say that about him?
00:57:45 Well, it is a female, I mean.
00:57:47 Damn!
00:57:49 Damn, dude.
00:57:51 What the fuck? In 2016?
00:57:53 Dude, are you higher something, dude?
00:57:55 Well, no, actually,
00:57:57 I am on the second floor, so...
00:57:59 If I jumped out of my window, I could
00:58:01 be seriously hurt.
00:58:03 Oh, what? Shit!
00:58:05 Ah, fuck. Ah, Christ.
00:58:07 It's spaghetti.
00:58:09 Back from already.
00:58:11 It's over is what it is.
00:58:13 It's over!
00:58:17 Yeah, sure.
00:58:19 Do whatever you want, stupid.
00:58:25 More.
00:58:27 Brave bird.
00:58:29 That's not even true.
00:58:31 We're in a rocky helmet, like a piece of shit.
00:58:33 Those are illegal.
00:58:35 Uh...
00:58:37 Those are illegal in our society.
00:58:39 Nah, dude.
00:58:41 Yes.
00:58:43 Oh, god. Why do I just keep...
00:58:45 Why do I keep doing these things?
00:58:47 Oh, bad boys.
00:58:49 He's got webbed.
00:58:51 I think that means you can't leave.
00:58:53 No, it reduces my speed,
00:58:55 but not for Bat Bullet,
00:58:57 because he is, um...
00:58:59 A flying. He's a flyer.
00:59:01 He is an up-and-laid ride, this guy.
00:59:07 Hmm.
00:59:09 Just use kill.
00:59:11 That's the best move.
00:59:15 Yeah, that is the habit.
00:59:17 Munchy.
00:59:19 Munchy reaches into his pocket.
00:59:21 Here, Shuckle. He'd take it.
00:59:23 It tosses a gun into the battle.
00:59:25 He did say he had grenades.
00:59:27 It's possible.
00:59:29 It's probable.
00:59:31 It's Pokemon!
00:59:33 That's the theme.
00:59:35 Pokemon!
00:59:37 Oh, man.
00:59:39 In Verbank City,
00:59:41 Roxy, the gym,
00:59:43 it's like her band is playing on the stage.
00:59:45 And, um...
00:59:47 It's awesome, because the song they're singing goes like
00:59:49 P-O-K-E-M-O-N
00:59:55 Pokemon!
00:59:57 That's the song, dude.
00:59:59 I'm so proud of you.
01:00:01 That's the fucking song.
01:00:03 Finally.
01:00:05 Finally free of the menace of Shuckle.
01:00:11 You got cheerleaders and cheerfollowers.
01:00:13 Foolish.
01:00:15 Oh!
01:00:17 Yeah.
01:00:19 I'm gonna turn this shit around.
01:00:21 You turn it around 360 or 180?
01:00:25 I don't even...
01:00:27 know...
01:00:31 what that means.
01:00:33 Turn it around 360 or 180. Which one?
01:00:35 Oh, shit!
01:00:37 Ah, shit. I'm fucking dead.
01:00:39 I'm dead.
01:00:41 I am dead.
01:00:43 Holy shit, you are dead. You only got one big fat friend.
01:00:45 And he's nearly dead himself.
01:00:49 This is intense Pokemon.
01:00:53 Um...
01:00:55 Will he do Moon Blast? Will he do Protect?
01:00:57 I gotta open up the damage calculator again.
01:00:59 Fire Punch.
01:01:01 We retaliate.
01:01:03 The moves that he has shown he has.
01:01:07 I forget, I forget if friend goes before...
01:01:09 who cable and...
01:01:11 I can't remember.
01:01:13 Wait, I can look.
01:01:15 I know I'm gonna look it up.
01:01:17 What?
01:01:19 I'm gonna look it up in the fucking...
01:01:21 Yeah, we're both damage calculated right now.
01:01:23 Yeah.
01:01:25 Yeah, boot cable it moves first.
01:01:29 I think I got it.
01:01:31 What's the name of your Pokemon?
01:01:35 I'm very confident that Moon Blast will kill friend.
01:01:43 Goddamn it!
01:01:47 What?
01:01:49 Oh!
01:01:51 Why did...
01:01:53 What happened?
01:01:55 Why did that?
01:01:57 I still lose though.
01:01:59 I still lose.
01:02:01 Oh yeah.
01:02:03 Oh my god, I fucking did it.
01:02:05 I can't believe it.
01:02:09 Dude, just because you've won the battle doesn't mean you're...
01:02:11 You're not gonna win.
01:02:13 It's a point for them.
01:02:15 That was so...
01:02:17 That was so close, holy shit.
01:02:19 We're gonna do a deciding round for this round.
01:02:21 This time there's a special rule.
01:02:23 You gotta die as quickly as possible.
01:02:25 Shit.
01:02:29 God...
01:02:33 Fuck.
01:02:37 I can't believe you predicted.
01:02:39 Of course.
01:02:41 Of course.
01:02:43 Look at me.
01:02:45 Just look at me and you'll see.
01:02:47 You'll see the reason why.
01:02:49 Foolish.
01:02:51 Foolish spell.
01:02:53 That was a foolish spell you cast.
01:02:55 Goddamn.
01:03:03 I know, I know in my heart what I must do.
01:03:05 No.
01:03:07 Don't do it.
01:03:09 I know in my heart what I must do.
01:03:11 Give up.
01:03:13 Fuck.
01:03:15 Digimon.
01:03:17 You should blast his oise.
01:03:19 Blast his oise out of his head.
01:03:21 He had...
01:03:23 He had scald, he had dragons something.
01:03:27 And he had punch.
01:03:29 Yeah, I did have punch.
01:03:31 Do you guys want any?
01:03:33 Because I brought some for everyone.
01:03:35 I would love some punch right now.
01:03:37 I can't be sober for this.
01:03:39 You have punch coming from Blastoise's back thing.
01:03:41 You just spray it.
01:03:43 Yeah, it's Hawaiian punch though.
01:03:47 Eww.
01:03:49 With just a tad of nails.
01:03:51 And battery acid.
01:03:53 Oh, that's okay.
01:03:55 I made just for you, Ben.
01:03:57 Because I know that you're inhuman.
01:03:59 Because no one know my little face like that.
01:04:01 That's what they say when you're having...
01:04:03 That's what they say when you're having sex
01:04:05 is you're inhuman.
01:04:07 Because you're probably in...
01:04:09 Unless you're into Pokemon.
01:04:11 Yes, which I, of course, am.
01:04:13 Yes, which I, of course, am.
01:04:15 Yes, which I, of course, am.
01:04:17 Ooh.
01:04:19 Okay, you can't kill a bat.
01:04:21 What a fucking piece of shit.
01:04:23 Nobody can kill a bat.
01:04:25 Nobody can kill a bat.
01:04:27 Nobody can kill a bat.
01:04:29 I got my utility out.
01:04:35 Don't worry.
01:04:37 It's all in the plan, dude.
01:04:39 It's all in the plan, Stan.
01:04:41 Impossible.
01:04:43 Could it be that Ben would win this game as well,
01:04:45 and then be the guy
01:04:47 who wins both games?
01:04:49 And then, is there another game after this?
01:04:51 Yeah, yeah.
01:04:53 There's the OU. There's the OU tier.
01:04:55 I owe you an apology.
01:04:57 Thanks.
01:04:59 Nice.
01:05:01 Shit.
01:05:03 What's good against grass?
01:05:05 Nothing.
01:05:07 Fire?
01:05:15 You can't...
01:05:17 Smother a fire with a leaf.
01:05:21 Oh god.
01:05:23 Okay.
01:05:25 You were a dummy if you think
01:05:27 that you're anything other than a dummy.
01:05:29 For what?
01:05:31 The sin that you've just done.
01:05:33 The fucking...
01:05:35 You are a ghoul, and you're about to see...
01:05:37 No, because this time,
01:05:39 this time I fucking know what I'm doing.
01:05:41 I know how to beat you.
01:05:43 Sacred sword!
01:05:47 Yes! God damn it.
01:05:49 Yes, I've learned.
01:05:51 I've learned from my mistakes.
01:05:53 I sliced him in twines.
01:05:55 I can't believe this.
01:05:57 I'm using the sacred power
01:05:59 of being a fucking dick.
01:06:01 I killed friends.
01:06:05 Okay, okay.
01:06:07 What a shame.
01:06:09 None of that look at sword guy.
01:06:11 He's kind of like his two eyes or his eyes,
01:06:13 and then the scarf is like
01:06:15 Zoidberg's lips.
01:06:17 Yeah.
01:06:19 He's really goofy and stupid.
01:06:21 Yeah.
01:06:23 Well, I mean, originally he was just
01:06:25 two swords,
01:06:27 so I don't know how good that design was
01:06:29 to begin with, but...
01:06:31 Well, with that, you could at least
01:06:33 just pick him up and whack him on a guy.
01:06:35 That's true.
01:06:37 Make a move, boy.
01:06:39 Oh god, I don't know. I know you've got Shadow Ball.
01:06:41 I know that's ghost type.
01:06:43 No, I don't. No, I don't, dude.
01:06:45 Yeah, yeah, get the fuck out of here.
01:06:47 He's got Shadow Ball.
01:06:49 It's ground type.
01:06:51 Just make a move, dude. Just make a move.
01:06:53 Okay, okay, okay.
01:06:55 I'm dark.
01:07:05 Pokemon, yeah.
01:07:07 Oh, yeah.
01:07:09 Alright, alright.
01:07:11 If you can kill bouquet boy,
01:07:13 really quick.
01:07:15 Oh, bouquet boy.
01:07:17 If you can kill him really quick, you win
01:07:19 because he's tough.
01:07:21 There we go.
01:07:23 Oh fuck, I forgot.
01:07:25 I forgot about Shadow Ball's ability.
01:07:29 But Moonblast could potentially counter it
01:07:31 by reducing the other thing.
01:07:33 Oh.
01:07:35 Oh.
01:07:37 Yeah, yeah.
01:07:39 Okay, okay.
01:07:41 Just keep doing the same attacks over and over.
01:07:43 I'm good.
01:07:45 The trap
01:07:47 will sprung.
01:07:49 Sure was.
01:07:51 Sure was.
01:07:59 Oh.
01:08:01 Oh no, did you have?
01:08:03 Oh, I thought so.
01:08:05 Okay, okay, okay.
01:08:07 Let's see.
01:08:11 Defog.
01:08:13 Was that what would happen?
01:08:15 Yeah, I got rid of him.
01:08:17 He was a size shocker.
01:08:19 He was a worst size shocker.
01:08:21 Super effective.
01:08:23 Plus 6%.
01:08:25 That's it.
01:08:27 And then Bat Bull is going to
01:08:29 flap his wings again.
01:08:31 Oh no.
01:08:33 0.75 evasion.
01:08:35 Sometimes special attack is lower than 1.
01:08:37 So he's going to switch up with Spaghetti Boy with this.
01:08:39 Oh, that was a mistake, dude.
01:08:41 No, Shuckle's going to hit him.
01:08:43 Shuckle's not going to know what hit him.
01:08:45 Shuckle's not going to know what hit him.
01:08:47 He's going to shoot him.
01:08:49 He's going to get him with his braper power.
01:08:51 You're going to throw rocks at him again.
01:08:53 He didn't let the rocks always critical hit.
01:08:55 That's quite bad for Spaghetti.
01:08:57 There's more rocks.
01:08:59 Haven't you realized yet
01:09:01 that Shuckle is the only thing
01:09:03 that's coming from winning?
01:09:05 Are you saying that when I destroy Shuckle
01:09:07 you'll become more powerful
01:09:09 than I could possibly imagine?
01:09:11 Yes, that is exactly what I'm saying.
01:09:15 Now we can really use the protect
01:09:17 on itself.
01:09:19 Ooh, nice.
01:09:21 Roosting up there with the rocks.
01:09:23 Being a brave boy.
01:09:25 He's coming down with it.
01:09:27 With the sickness.
01:09:29 Down with the sickness.
01:09:31 Protecting himself again.
01:09:33 He's very good at that.
01:09:35 He wears his safety gear.
01:09:37 Really?
01:09:39 Protect stops me from defogging?
01:09:41 What a bunch of bullshit.
01:09:43 Whoa, dude.
01:09:45 That is big. Protect.
01:09:47 This is fucking nonsense.
01:09:51 What's happening right here?
01:09:53 Just defies all...
01:09:55 Oh my god. There's no way out.
01:09:57 There's no way out, is there?
01:09:59 He's just gonna keep using this.
01:10:01 Look how low your evasion is.
01:10:03 Aw, you're fucked now.
01:10:05 Just keep using those rocks.
01:10:07 Just keep using them.
01:10:11 What do you mean, yeah?
01:10:13 It's the weakest part of the one that's gone.
01:10:15 You don't have a...
01:10:17 You don't have a prayer.
01:10:19 Shuckle is it.
01:10:21 Shuckle is your final bastion.
01:10:23 But now it's the rock song.
01:10:29 Yeah, you act like that's gonna kill me.
01:10:31 Eat that fucking bat hole.
01:10:33 Eat that fucking bat hole.
01:10:35 But you know what? I'm making a statement right now.
01:10:37 Eat that bat hole. You're big enough.
01:10:39 Here we go.
01:10:41 Chomp, chomp.
01:10:43 No, my black sludge.
01:10:49 You're smarter. You're smarter.
01:10:59 That's a song.
01:11:05 Why are you doing this?
01:11:07 Why'd you stop?
01:11:13 Careful, you're gonna get content in the aid.
01:11:19 You can do it, come on.
01:11:21 Come on.
01:11:23 Man, man, this is it.
01:11:25 This is truly it.
01:11:27 Are you at the end of your rope?
01:11:29 This is the best of times, and this is the worst of times.
01:11:39 Ooh, nice dead.
01:11:41 This bat, even though Ben didn't care about this bat,
01:11:45 is winning every single game.
01:11:47 Yes.
01:11:57 Oh.
01:11:59 Sword versus sword dance.
01:12:01 Can you slice him up?
01:12:03 Slice those onions.
01:12:05 You'll cry, but he'll be dead.
01:12:07 True.
01:12:13 This is intense.
01:12:15 It's so intense that I can't even...
01:12:19 Stay awake.
01:12:21 Nice.
01:12:27 They're doing swords dancing,
01:12:29 but one of them is actual swords, so that one looks better.
01:12:31 Damn it.
01:12:33 He's got times for attack, but no health.
01:12:35 What will happen?
01:12:37 Only time will tell.
01:12:39 I didn't mean...
01:12:41 The time has told.
01:12:43 The time has told me what I need to do.
01:12:45 You can do it.
01:12:47 Now he's got priority.
01:12:49 Oh, God.
01:12:51 Wow, it all comes down to this.
01:12:53 So Ben wins round two.
01:12:55 Wow.
01:12:57 I won little cup and underused.
01:12:59 All right.
01:13:01 Now it's time for the ultimate battle.
01:13:03 The ultimate battle of wits.
01:13:05 Oh, boy.
01:13:07 Let's have a look at these guys.
01:13:09 We got on Munchie's team, we have...
01:13:11 Of course you're using slow boat Munchie.
01:13:13 Of course you're using slow boat.
01:13:15 Hey, slow bro, dude, fuck you.
01:13:17 Oh, shit.
01:13:19 We got...
01:13:21 Huge bird, different from small bird.
01:13:23 We got...
01:13:25 Latino.
01:13:27 We got...
01:13:29 Slow boy.
01:13:31 We got big fucking mess of
01:13:33 tangled cables.
01:13:35 Fucking mess.
01:13:37 And we got...
01:13:39 That big guy.
01:13:41 We got a Tyrant Godzilla.
01:13:43 We got Godzilla.
01:13:45 And on the other side, on Ben's team,
01:13:47 we have a little girl with a big
01:13:49 weird jelly underneath.
01:13:51 It's diamonds.
01:13:53 She's a diamond girl.
01:13:55 She's a diamond in the rough, dude.
01:13:57 We got chocolate pudding
01:13:59 demon.
01:14:01 We got
01:14:03 egg with leg.
01:14:05 Egg with leg.
01:14:09 We got that guy.
01:14:11 Slow boy.
01:14:13 We got
01:14:15 Power Ranger, we got Super Sentai here.
01:14:17 Steel Samurai, one of them.
01:14:19 And we got a Latino too.
01:14:21 So...
01:14:23 That's pretty good.
01:14:25 I have not seen these Pokemon
01:14:27 ever used.
01:14:29 But I don't play Pokemon, so...
01:14:31 Well, you're about to see them used
01:14:33 and abused.
01:14:35 They're foolish potential.
01:14:37 Nice.
01:14:39 Foolish.
01:14:41 Fucking foolish, dude.
01:14:43 And we're off with bird versus...
01:14:45 Oh, we're not.
01:14:47 We're friend versus bullet.
01:14:49 Pink friends
01:14:51 attack each other.
01:14:53 Pink friends attack?
01:14:59 So we got...
01:15:01 I've got choice here.
01:15:03 This is an even match.
01:15:05 It's a one paralyze, believe me.
01:15:07 Disabilities don't count.
01:15:11 Oh, now he's paralyzed.
01:15:13 Egg with leg.
01:15:15 It doesn't fucking matter.
01:15:17 Yeah, barely.
01:15:23 I like egg with leg.
01:15:25 You mean melon bullet?
01:15:27 My bro.
01:15:29 My bro melon bullet.
01:15:31 What tricks does this idiot have?
01:15:33 That is quite the moustache.
01:15:37 It doesn't even start from his nose.
01:15:39 It starts from his eyebrows.
01:15:41 Yeah.
01:15:43 Moustache like that before?
01:15:45 No, sir.
01:15:47 What's he gonna do?
01:15:51 It's a grass type.
01:15:53 First grass and steel.
01:15:55 This can only mean many things.
01:15:59 This guy...
01:16:01 He's acting good.
01:16:03 Really, he's just a fool.
01:16:07 There's fucking shit tons of spikes everywhere.
01:16:09 What is he doing with his spikes?
01:16:11 He's trying to random up my ass
01:16:13 because he knows I love being gay.
01:16:17 I mean, you do.
01:16:19 True.
01:16:23 But sometimes you just gotta look inside yourself and say...
01:16:25 What bird?
01:16:27 What pumpkin?
01:16:35 I don't think anything's actually happened yet.
01:16:37 I'm not sure though.
01:16:39 Dude, this is...
01:16:41 I'm totally winning right now.
01:16:43 I've got my spikes out.
01:16:45 I've paralyzed his dudes.
01:16:47 Who gives a shit about any of that gay shit?
01:16:49 He doesn't have a single prayer.
01:16:51 Dude, has anyone used nut type?
01:16:53 Oh, it's chocolate pudding.
01:16:55 Ah, steel type immune to toxic.
01:16:57 Oh no.
01:16:59 Oh yeah.
01:17:01 Oh no.
01:17:03 Oh yeah.
01:17:08 Oh no.
01:17:10 They're switching out thick and fast.
01:17:12 Trying to figure out the best combo potential
01:17:15 setup movement.
01:17:17 But they're just gonna keep going in and out
01:17:19 with their Pokemon.
01:17:21 In and out and in and out, I say.
01:17:23 That's what they're doing.
01:17:25 Pokemon balls flying like hither and thither.
01:17:27 It's like that one show.
01:17:31 Pokemon.
01:17:33 Yeah.
01:17:36 Except in actual the show Pokemon
01:17:39 had a real battle.
01:17:41 I really feel like all my planning
01:17:43 paid off.
01:17:45 You know, when we agreed to this battle
01:17:47 in like an hour, you were like,
01:17:49 okay, got my teams and I was like,
01:17:51 oh my god, he made them so fast.
01:17:53 He must know exactly what he's doing.
01:17:55 But turns out he's just a fucking nerd.
01:17:57 And I spent like two whole days putting these teams together.
01:17:59 And it paid off.
01:18:01 Listen man, listen man.
01:18:03 All that matters is that I have my pride
01:18:05 at the end of the day.
01:18:07 All I need is my pride.
01:18:09 But you lost everything.
01:18:11 My job.
01:18:13 My wife.
01:18:15 All video games.
01:18:17 Pride comes after and before fall.
01:18:21 Oh my god, he turned into a jet ski.
01:18:25 Misogyny.
01:18:33 Wow.
01:18:35 I didn't realize he could have an airplane.
01:18:37 You didn't know about that?
01:18:39 You didn't know about planes?
01:18:41 Wait, dude, is there a Twin Towers Pokemon?
01:18:43 There is, as a matter of fact.
01:18:45 It's called...
01:18:47 Well, it starts out as...
01:18:49 A single.
01:18:51 A single building.
01:18:53 It did evolve into two.
01:18:55 Yeah, it's awesome.
01:18:57 When given the U.S. Constitution
01:18:59 and traded.
01:19:01 Yes.
01:19:03 It's weak to flying.
01:19:05 Yes.
01:19:11 Oh shit.
01:19:13 The sandstorm, these spikes, this leash.
01:19:15 Misogyny's having a hard time.
01:19:17 Oh, but he used boom!
01:19:19 And he got like...
01:19:21 Oh, am I gonna get him? I got him!
01:19:23 I've been one the first round.
01:19:25 Yeah, I think so.
01:19:27 Hang on, it's not over yet.
01:19:29 I think it's over.
01:19:31 It's over.
01:19:33 I've got fucking three spikes
01:19:35 and a stealth rock out and he just lost his...
01:19:37 Whoa, that's like all his health.
01:19:39 That's clearer.
01:19:41 Half his health in one big swell.
01:19:43 It does look cool though.
01:19:45 I like that bird.
01:19:49 I think it's supposed to be like a
01:19:51 Kestrel or something.
01:19:53 Nothing.
01:19:55 Or a weirdly waddly
01:19:57 bird with a thing on his head.
01:19:59 A Unibird.
01:20:01 Unicorn bird.
01:20:03 But a backwards side head unicorn?
01:20:05 I can't believe this!
01:20:07 How did you know I would stay in?
01:20:09 Um...
01:20:11 Uh...
01:20:13 I don't know.
01:20:15 I don't need your lies.
01:20:17 I used S.C.A.L.D. because it would
01:20:19 be effective against anything.
01:20:21 True.
01:20:23 Well, I guess except for the slow bro.
01:20:25 Um, whatever.
01:20:27 It's S.C.A.L.D. like you get a boiling pan
01:20:29 and you just throw it at the Pokémon and they go
01:20:31 Ah!
01:20:33 Regardless of what type they are.
01:20:35 Because nobody likes putting
01:20:37 their face in a boiling pan of noodles.
01:20:39 Except for the noodles.
01:20:41 But they don't get those because it's just water.
01:20:45 Oh boy.
01:20:47 That waifu is
01:20:49 times two speed and attack.
01:20:51 I mean, no special.
01:20:53 That's what it is.
01:20:55 Oh god, I was paralyzed.
01:20:57 That was bad. That was a bad time to be
01:20:59 paralyzed. I'm still gonna win.
01:21:01 Paralyze really does occasionally make the game
01:21:03 really interesting.
01:21:05 By preventing anything from happening.
01:21:07 Well, yeah, you're like, I'm sure I can do this.
01:21:09 Oh wait, I can't. Whoa!
01:21:11 You know.
01:21:13 Whoa, bro.
01:21:15 Slow bro.
01:21:17 Pherothorn is fucking OP.
01:21:19 He is insane.
01:21:21 I can defeat him. I know.
01:21:23 Ever.
01:21:25 And you know why I didn't use him on my team?
01:21:27 What? Because he looked ugly.
01:21:29 He's so good.
01:21:31 He doesn't look terrible.
01:21:33 He looks like Metacross.
01:21:37 Why don't you just use Metagross then?
01:21:39 Because it's not a situation.
01:21:41 He was in my first draft, but I didn't like that one very much.
01:21:45 He's got those, that springly, sprangly
01:21:47 thing going on.
01:21:49 He sure does.
01:21:53 These Pokemon cries are weird.
01:21:55 Yes they are.
01:21:57 It's like they're crying for help.
01:21:59 Almost.
01:22:01 Most things do.
01:22:03 I had ridden a creepypasta about this.
01:22:05 Yeah. You turn around.
01:22:07 Oh, they're red with blood.
01:22:09 Oh.
01:22:11 Their eyes went red with blood.
01:22:13 They went bloody and attacked everybody.
01:22:15 The spikes became real spikes.
01:22:17 They were real spikes.
01:22:19 And they shut it on my computer.
01:22:21 Wait, what?
01:22:23 Pikachu paralyzed me for real.
01:22:25 Oh no. It's hyper realistic
01:22:27 Slowbro.
01:22:29 Zoom in on Slowbro's
01:22:31 hyper real face.
01:22:39 Damn it.
01:22:41 Has Ben got all his Pokemon alive?
01:22:43 Yeah.
01:22:45 Wow.
01:22:47 His team
01:22:49 completely counters mine.
01:22:53 We should have used
01:22:55 Vile Plume.
01:22:57 Yeah, Vile Plume's nice.
01:23:01 I gotta do it.
01:23:03 I just need to fucking go for it.
01:23:05 There's nothing I can do.
01:23:07 Just stab him with your head.
01:23:09 You got spikes on it?
01:23:11 Yeah, there's nothing I can do.
01:23:13 No, no, no, no.
01:23:15 What?
01:23:17 Super effective. Not even quite.
01:23:21 Not even at all.
01:23:23 You clearly have magic guard.
01:23:31 No.
01:23:35 Soft boiled leftovers.
01:23:37 No.
01:23:41 I want to
01:23:43 defeat.
01:23:45 It could move.
01:23:47 It's crazy.
01:23:49 No.
01:23:51 Come up to the home stretch,
01:23:53 ladies and gentlemen.
01:23:55 Don't you have two packet men?
01:23:57 No.
01:23:59 Wife who keeps getting beaten like the wife she is.
01:24:01 No.
01:24:03 Oh.
01:24:05 But he could come back
01:24:07 because he's continually healing.
01:24:09 If you sweep with...
01:24:11 Okay, okay, I got him.
01:24:13 No, I can't.
01:24:15 I gotta do so.
01:24:17 Sweep up.
01:24:19 Sweep up with that broom.
01:24:21 Is there a broom Pokemon?
01:24:23 Is it OP? It should be.
01:24:25 Yeah, it should be.
01:24:27 It's abilities and it swoops away all the hazards.
01:24:33 Come on and crit. Please give me a crit.
01:24:35 If now is the fucking time.
01:24:41 Oh no.
01:24:43 It's a battle of attrition.
01:24:45 What does that mean?
01:24:47 I think it's irrelevant here.
01:24:53 You know, it's a battle
01:24:55 for fucking gay people who don't matter.
01:24:57 Like the war in Afghanistan?
01:24:59 No.
01:25:01 The Afghanistan people are just goons,
01:25:03 so I don't care about them.
01:25:05 Gugliayistan.
01:25:07 Gugliayran.
01:25:09 Okay.
01:25:11 What I'm doing right here
01:25:13 is not what I should be doing.
01:25:15 Um...
01:25:17 You know, what would be really cool
01:25:19 is if you two were both recording
01:25:21 and you could...
01:25:23 there would be like onscreen
01:25:25 like what are you hovering over?
01:25:27 Like what are you gonna do?
01:25:29 But instead I'm just looking at
01:25:31 what happens afterwards.
01:25:33 I am hovering really intensely right now.
01:25:35 Yeah.
01:25:37 You gotta figure out what to do
01:25:39 in case you wanna be gay
01:25:41 or in case you wanna be straight.
01:25:43 That's what all decisions come down to.
01:25:45 It's not right or wrong, it's being straight.
01:25:47 You care straight.
01:25:49 Shit.
01:25:51 Damn it.
01:25:53 Oh.
01:25:55 Oh.
01:25:57 This bell is fucking terrible.
01:25:59 He punched him, he punched him,
01:26:01 he gonna slap him in the face.
01:26:03 But instead,
01:26:05 he's soft-boiled.
01:26:07 Quick, use attack.
01:26:11 That's all I can do.
01:26:13 You can just attack.
01:26:17 These turns are lasting a year now.
01:26:19 Yeah.
01:26:23 Um...
01:26:25 Hang on, what the fuck does stored power do?
01:26:27 It's psychic type, okay.
01:26:31 Yeah, sure, sure it is.
01:26:33 Sure it is.
01:26:35 A melon bullet is used all four of its moves
01:26:37 so I can see all of them.
01:26:41 Oh, pink one.
01:26:43 Oh, I've made a mistake.
01:26:45 I have made a mistake.
01:26:49 Ah, damn.
01:26:51 Super mega.
01:26:53 It sure did grow.
01:26:55 It's got those...
01:26:57 Those little dingley doodles.
01:27:09 Are you not entertained?
01:27:11 Well, you shouldn't be because
01:27:13 this is very interesting.
01:27:17 I might speed up
01:27:19 or cut out in between
01:27:21 nothing happening.
01:27:23 Yeah, me.
01:27:25 But I won't, probably.
01:27:27 Some of this is real important.
01:27:29 Oh no.
01:27:31 What a shame.
01:27:39 Oh dear.
01:27:41 Oh dear.
01:27:43 Oh, Nisama.
01:27:49 Oh.
01:27:51 Fuck, Mudboy's dead.
01:27:53 He looks cool.
01:27:55 Oh Nisama.
01:27:57 Taunt?
01:27:59 Taunt?
01:28:01 I mean, you can't...
01:28:03 No, I just, like, I think
01:28:05 there are no different games with taunt.
01:28:07 What?!
01:28:09 Whoa! Is he gonna sweep?
01:28:11 I'm not gonna be able to sweep.
01:28:13 You can, you killed a guy.
01:28:15 No, I'm not gonna be able to.
01:28:17 Just use your grenade.
01:28:19 Just use my life grenades
01:28:21 and start off shotguns.
01:28:23 Sort of grenades.
01:28:25 Yes, exactly.
01:28:27 They explode real good.
01:28:29 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
01:28:31 Yeah, I know, I know.
01:28:33 I should have done this years ago.
01:28:35 It's Red Ranger.
01:28:37 Use Dino City.
01:28:39 I forgot about paralysis.
01:28:41 But I'm still gonna die.
01:28:47 There's nothing I could possibly...
01:28:49 Oh!
01:28:51 He got his power.
01:28:53 There's nothing I could possibly do right now.
01:28:55 What, is this depressed chi?
01:28:57 Instead of munchy?
01:28:59 Shit, shit, shit.
01:29:01 There's nothing I could possibly do right now.
01:29:03 Shut the fuck up, I'm gonna kill you.
01:29:05 There's nothing I could possibly do right now
01:29:07 to impact this situation.
01:29:09 Okay.
01:29:11 Let's just end the game then.
01:29:13 Alright, well he caught him with a big
01:29:15 swish.
01:29:17 Well, there's actually nothing I could do now.
01:29:21 I'm gonna make you...
01:29:23 No! No!
01:29:25 Oh, oh...
01:29:27 Just one more whank, I mean punch.
01:29:29 God damn it!
01:29:31 Did he get paralyzed again?
01:29:33 Oh, he did.
01:29:35 Yes!
01:29:41 Let's have a look at Waifu's stats.
01:29:43 She's got 10 soft boils left.
01:29:47 So that might be enough to survive this whole match.
01:29:51 What will Ben be doing?
01:29:53 Basically giving valuable information to my opponent.
01:29:55 Well, he can hover over, right?
01:29:57 No, he can't!
01:29:59 Can he not? No!
01:30:01 I mean, I can see some things.
01:30:03 I can see the moves he's used before.
01:30:05 I can see his possible
01:30:07 speed values.
01:30:09 But you can't see how many times he's used the...
01:30:11 Alright.
01:30:13 Yeah, I can see how many times.
01:30:15 Okay, so there you go.
01:30:17 I'm totally in the right.
01:30:19 Oh no, if this were a judge and a jury,
01:30:21 then you would be the jury.
01:30:23 And I'd be the gesture.
01:30:25 I'd be jury Seinfeld.
01:30:27 I like that show, it's a good show.
01:30:29 I've never seen it.
01:30:31 Oh no, I'm dead.
01:30:33 Thank you, thank you.
01:30:35 Oh no.
01:30:37 Oh no.
01:30:39 Ben St. Wins Ding Ding.
01:30:41 Oh no.
01:30:43 Is this the first round of this one?
01:30:45 Yeah, that was the first round.
01:30:47 So how do you think that went munchy?
01:30:49 I hate him.
01:30:53 Ben, do you have any words?
01:30:55 Do you have any words?
01:30:57 I...
01:30:59 I almost fucked it up and let him
01:31:01 his Clefable sweep.
01:31:03 And then...
01:31:05 I got real unlucky with paralysis,
01:31:07 but there was never any chance.
01:31:09 Nobody has any
01:31:11 fucking clue what they're doing
01:31:13 when they face me.
01:31:15 No one. No one has the single clue.
01:31:17 Not one person in the entire fucking world.
01:31:23 Starting off with the Japanese man
01:31:25 versus the Mexican.
01:31:27 Jeez, yeah.
01:31:29 Because he's got a lot of hair, right?
01:31:31 And the Japanese man
01:31:33 is a power ranger.
01:31:35 Of course, of course.
01:31:37 There's my reasoning behind that.
01:31:41 Oh, and he jumped on a bird's head.
01:31:43 That's gotta hurt the bird.
01:31:47 Fuck.
01:31:51 Ooh, he's on burn.
01:31:53 He's getting insulted.
01:31:55 Sick bird's bird.
01:32:05 It's okay, I know exactly what to do.
01:32:07 Are you gonna do
01:32:09 win game?
01:32:11 It's my favorite move.
01:32:13 What the fuck?
01:32:15 Why didn't that work?
01:32:17 Sucker punch. What else didn't work?
01:32:21 Wait. Why didn't that work?
01:32:23 Sucker punch doesn't work.
01:32:25 Oh my god, it's because your priority's higher, isn't it?
01:32:27 It's because you have double...
01:32:29 Oh, god.
01:32:31 You used it twice and it fell both times.
01:32:35 It's complicated.
01:32:39 Maybe you should just lay...
01:32:41 lay off the sauce.
01:32:45 I keep tapping over, but I'm not supposed to
01:32:47 because I'm recording and I hate that.
01:32:49 Lay off the sauce.
01:32:55 That was fucking abominable.
01:32:57 Like the snowman.
01:32:59 That was the worst.
01:33:01 That was the worst B'sharp has ever performed.
01:33:05 That was pretty quick death.
01:33:11 Alright, so we're starting with Munchy getting
01:33:13 an advantage with the Pokemon amount.
01:33:15 But anyways, we all know that doesn't mean Jack.
01:33:21 Oh no.
01:33:23 Oh, it parallelsed.
01:33:25 Oh no.
01:33:27 Oh no!
01:33:31 Why does he use many spikes?
01:33:33 Holy fucking shit.
01:33:35 Three in a row.
01:33:37 Paralysis is like 25%.
01:33:39 So that is
01:33:41 statistically
01:33:43 Paralysis and abominable.
01:33:49 Okay, good.
01:33:51 I like it.
01:33:59 Yeah, you think you know shit.
01:34:01 You think you know fuck shit.
01:34:03 Damn it.
01:34:07 Everybody knows shit fuck.
01:34:13 You know what I'm gonna do.
01:34:15 You know what I'm gonna fucking do.
01:34:17 Something about his skin.
01:34:19 This is not a whole lot you can do, buddy.
01:34:21 It looks like a chocolate eclair
01:34:23 or like a glazed chocolate donut
01:34:25 or something.
01:34:27 I like it.
01:34:29 But he's got a skull face.
01:34:31 I don't eat donuts with skulls.
01:34:33 That's not cool.
01:34:35 Oh shit.
01:34:37 Whatever.
01:34:39 Well what? Flash fire.
01:34:41 He's immune to fire attacks
01:34:43 and if he gets hit by one
01:34:45 his fire gets
01:34:47 stronger.
01:34:49 Impressive.
01:34:51 Impressive.
01:34:53 Two frags in two seconds.
01:34:55 Impressive.
01:35:07 You thought I was gonna
01:35:09 thunder wave.
01:35:11 Nah, I just didn't fucking care about
01:35:13 what bird.
01:35:15 What bird?
01:35:17 Turned down for bird.
01:35:27 Oh no.
01:35:29 Oh dear.
01:35:31 The stakes are never higher.
01:35:33 Oh no.
01:35:35 Never higher than right now.
01:35:37 And he's missing a little bit
01:35:39 of mud.
01:35:41 Mr. Saturday, it's you.
01:35:43 Mr. Saturday.
01:35:45 And it's Mr. Saturday.
01:35:47 I predicted you bitch.
01:35:49 Oh no.
01:35:51 He's hurt by poison but don't worry
01:35:53 because he's about to reek.
01:35:55 It was all just an elaborate meme.
01:35:57 He's going to 9-11
01:35:59 with a meteor.
01:36:01 It was all just an elaborate meme
01:36:03 to get you to get a boner.
01:36:05 That's what you did.
01:36:07 You got a boner.
01:36:09 No.
01:36:11 No.
01:36:13 He played you like a damn
01:36:15 piano.
01:36:19 Shit.
01:36:21 He played you like a damn video game.
01:36:23 It's pretty fun.
01:36:27 Pink buffet.
01:36:29 Bullet, I mean.
01:36:35 Oh fuck.
01:36:37 You're one point faster
01:36:39 than me.
01:36:41 Well you know.
01:36:43 You're one point faster
01:36:45 than me.
01:36:47 Well you know.
01:36:49 I don't.
01:36:53 Bullish.
01:36:55 Yeah, truly.
01:36:57 Boom.
01:36:59 Truly.
01:37:01 I did it. I fucking did it.
01:37:03 Truly.
01:37:05 Well it is Godzilla.
01:37:07 I didn't realize that when I said it was Godzilla before.
01:37:09 Yeah.
01:37:17 Oh, it got a Gmail
01:37:19 message.
01:37:21 Someone subscribed to my Twitch account
01:37:23 at munchie
01:37:25 at twitch.tv
01:37:27 slash munchie wears tiny hats.
01:37:29 Whoa.
01:37:31 I'm subscribed to you.
01:37:33 Yeah, you're a newly ascended master.
01:37:35 That's what we call our followers.
01:37:39 Newly ascended master.
01:37:41 I would go, but I don't know what you do
01:37:43 on that channel.
01:37:45 What do you do?
01:37:47 Advertise.
01:37:49 Sometimes I play video games.
01:37:51 Other times I twiddle on my clip
01:37:53 and I do nothing.
01:37:55 Which one of those is better?
01:37:57 Yeah, man.
01:38:01 Go on.
01:38:03 Well, if you're
01:38:05 in it to win it, then you know
01:38:07 how to bebop and scat all around
01:38:09 Manhattan.
01:38:11 Yes.
01:38:13 Godzilla dead.
01:38:15 Oh, Godzilla.
01:38:19 Egg with leg.
01:38:21 Comin' at ya with his face.
01:38:23 Spikey though he is.
01:38:25 He has a soul that is very soft
01:38:27 and nice.
01:38:29 He has a hard outer shell
01:38:31 and a soft inner shell.
01:38:33 Hold on, I gotta open up the damage calculator
01:38:35 again.
01:38:41 I gotta open up
01:38:43 the damage calculator.
01:38:45 One plus two is three
01:38:47 damage.
01:38:49 Yeah, you don't know that.
01:38:51 Ah, it dunes.
01:38:53 I think I know what your calculator is.
01:39:01 It's not that good.
01:39:03 I need to blow my nose
01:39:05 but there's nothing in sight.
01:39:07 There's nothing in reach.
01:39:09 I can't blow my nose.
01:39:11 It's just gonna slowly come out and go into my beard
01:39:13 and I'm gonna have to just deal with it.
01:39:17 Meanwhile, in Pokemon,
01:39:19 nothing is happening still.
01:39:21 They're staring each other down.
01:39:23 The waifu is staring at Mellon Bullet
01:39:25 and he's doing a little hip, hip, hip,
01:39:27 hip, hip, dance.
01:39:29 He's not intimidating at all.
01:39:31 It's very cute, actually.
01:39:33 Mellon Bullet is doing a little shakey-shake
01:39:35 because his legs are made of springs.
01:39:37 It's got spring legs.
01:39:39 They're vine springs.
01:39:41 Vine springs.
01:39:43 As actual.
01:39:45 Actual.
01:39:47 And now we got Slowbro who, honestly,
01:39:49 his design is annoying.
01:39:51 You are the worst person.
01:39:57 Yeah, it looks like Ben do, don't you think?
01:40:03 It looks like a Pokemon
01:40:05 that's just like, I'd rather have anything.
01:40:07 Anything else.
01:40:09 Tentacruel is my favorite
01:40:11 water Pokemon, I think.
01:40:13 That's a good Pokemon.
01:40:15 He's big and he's a fucking evil guy
01:40:17 because he's got angry eyes.
01:40:19 Angry eyes are the best types of Pokemon.
01:40:21 He should be a genre
01:40:23 of angry eye to recall.
01:40:25 I completely 100% agree.
01:40:29 Like Voltorb? Voltorb's pretty great.
01:40:31 It's perhaps okay.
01:40:37 I gotta, I gotta, I gotta
01:40:39 put the kibosh on this waifu situation
01:40:41 before it gets out of hand.
01:40:43 Just waifu situation.
01:40:47 Yes.
01:40:53 Oh, dear.
01:40:55 That's more than I
01:40:57 can prepare to accept.
01:41:03 Oh, no!
01:41:09 Taunt ended.
01:41:11 That's not fair.
01:41:13 That can't happen.
01:41:15 That, that can not happen.
01:41:17 What the fuck?
01:41:19 Yes!
01:41:21 That was, that was
01:41:23 alright. I thought Munchy had a chance
01:41:25 but now he only has a moustache
01:41:27 and a guy.
01:41:31 And everyone knows that
01:41:33 a Mexican can't defeat a diamond
01:41:35 in the rough.
01:41:37 Well, it's not that rough.
01:41:39 It's like a park, you know,
01:41:41 bench.
01:41:43 It's like quite nice.
01:41:47 Gigadran.
01:41:51 Yes.
01:41:53 Well, wait a minute. Maybe it's not Mexican.
01:41:55 Maybe it's Jamaican and it's got dreadlocks
01:41:57 and that's a lot of dreadlocks.
01:41:59 Maybe it's not any nationally, huh?
01:42:01 Maybe, maybe it just wants to live
01:42:03 its life just like you and me.
01:42:05 I don't believe that anyone wants to live
01:42:07 their life just like you or me.
01:42:09 I think they have to be different
01:42:11 and identifiable and
01:42:13 ridiculable.
01:42:15 The main quality I look for in people is
01:42:17 ridiculable.
01:42:19 You gotta be able to laugh at something
01:42:21 and if you can't, it's not very funny.
01:42:23 Not very worth your time.
01:42:27 Okay, we got friend version 2.0.
01:42:29 Something bit his butt
01:42:31 and he stood up but he didn't do
01:42:33 anything about it.
01:42:37 We got 3 vs 1.
01:42:39 Oh no.
01:42:41 I used healing wish
01:42:43 and I sacrificed plane bullet
01:42:45 to give melon bullet a second lease on life.
01:42:47 Oh, it's over.
01:42:49 Now he's got a leech on friend.
01:42:51 Oh, it's over.
01:42:53 Yeah, man.
01:42:55 He's got a leech on friends life.
01:42:57 The video's over.
01:42:59 You thought I was
01:43:01 cruise?
01:43:03 Roll the credits, bro.
01:43:05 Oh, it's over.
01:43:07 I swept it.
01:43:09 I fucking swept this tournament.
01:43:11 Oh, no.
01:43:13 Swipped it under the rug.
01:43:15 Nobody'll know about it.
01:43:17 Oh, no.
01:43:19 It's over.
01:43:21 It doesn't actually do.
01:43:23 All my planning
01:43:25 paid off.
01:43:27 Oh my god.
01:43:29 Guys, you know,
01:43:31 champion will be out
01:43:33 three days later than it
01:43:35 otherwise would have been,
01:43:37 but at least I've beaten my chief fucking Pokemon.
01:43:43 I would say it was a worthy cause
01:43:45 because you're happy about it, but I don't care.
01:43:47 Cool.
01:43:49 I wouldn't watch this video.
01:43:51 I'd leave a comment saying no.
01:43:53 End it.
01:43:55 It's okay. Nobody watches
01:43:57 Rowdy fucker's cop killing.
01:43:59 Enough of this.
01:44:01 The first one got is like the least.
01:44:03 Oh, yeah. No, yeah.
01:44:05 It has like 2000.
01:44:07 I've still never gone back and watched that,
01:44:09 even though I had the time.
01:44:11 Oh, god.
01:44:13 Now, hold on.
01:44:15 The grand finale is going to be something special
01:44:17 that I prepared just for you.
01:44:19 Wait, there's more?
01:44:21 Just a very quick thing.
01:44:23 Did Ben win every single...
01:44:25 Yeah, he did.
01:44:27 Win every single type of match.
01:44:29 Yes.
01:44:31 You were fun.
01:44:33 I'm the best. Wait, random?
01:44:35 Oh, okay.
01:44:37 I'll do it.
01:44:39 Wait, they're different levels?
01:44:41 Yeah, a little bit.
01:44:43 Well, we got Polirath,
01:44:45 which is a cool guy,
01:44:47 and Zekrom, which is a fucking
01:44:49 dark drill.
01:44:51 Oh, and you can't see the enemy's Pokemon.
01:44:53 Why aren't they all like that?
01:44:55 No clue. It was random.
01:44:57 You're not allowed to know what you have.
01:44:59 Oh, my god.
01:45:01 Yeah, I can see what I have.
01:45:03 Down at the bottom.
01:45:05 Wow.
01:45:07 I don't know what you're looking at,
01:45:09 but I'm looking at some real fucking intense shit
01:45:11 on my side.
01:45:13 You pretty much always get the big guys in this.
01:45:15 I like Polirath's little
01:45:17 little leg crease.
01:45:21 What the fuck is that?
01:45:23 It's awesome.
01:45:25 Oh, my god, I love Kling Kling.
01:45:27 Let's look at...
01:45:29 He's so good.
01:45:31 What does Zekrom turn into a little guy?
01:45:33 It's a substitute.
01:45:35 Oh, god, what's good against steel?
01:45:37 Fighting ground
01:45:39 and fire.
01:45:47 Kling Kling vs. Magnemite.
01:45:51 OTP.
01:45:57 Oh, my god, it's war.
01:45:59 It's why, why?
01:46:01 No, it's not.
01:46:03 It's Zed.
01:46:05 It's the Z Snake.
01:46:07 Shit.
01:46:11 What is one level 81
01:46:13 level 76?
01:46:15 That's kind of unfair.
01:46:17 Are you...
01:46:19 Don't fuck with me, Kling Kling.
01:46:21 Shit.
01:46:27 Oh, no.
01:46:29 Dang, I didn't go that well.
01:46:31 No, yeah.
01:46:33 Not even close.
01:46:35 That fucking legendary
01:46:37 bug snake
01:46:39 friend.
01:46:41 What is it?
01:46:43 Oh, you did it.
01:46:45 Oh, yeah.
01:46:47 Extreme speed on Zygarde.
01:46:49 You did it. You absolutely did it.
01:46:51 Sylveon.
01:46:53 That's just a whatever.
01:46:55 I've seen him before.
01:47:01 Oh, wow.
01:47:03 Does one of you have the god?
01:47:05 That's close enough.
01:47:07 Yeah.
01:47:09 Oh.
01:47:11 I hate Sylveon.
01:47:13 Sylveon always fucks with me.
01:47:15 I don't like it.
01:47:17 We used to use it to accelerate.
01:47:23 What are you talking about? I don't even know what that means.
01:47:25 You need to find your soul and you need to go faster.
01:47:27 Oh, is that...
01:47:29 Is that all that did?
01:47:31 Wow.
01:47:33 You got two legendaries
01:47:35 from the same game already.
01:47:37 Three.
01:47:39 No, yeah, yeah, yeah. From the same game.
01:47:41 We have three legendaries altogether.
01:47:43 Wow.
01:47:45 So much he has no legendaries yet.
01:47:47 As far as I know.
01:47:49 That seems like a bit of a wish.
01:47:51 But he's still
01:47:53 giggle with.
01:47:55 Man, all my Pokemon are so fucking big.
01:47:57 I know, dude. They got big and meaty.
01:47:59 Just like your fucking butt.
01:48:05 Yeah.
01:48:07 Oh, it's egg face.
01:48:11 This is the meme one.
01:48:13 I want to zoom in, but I can't.
01:48:17 I don't want to look at the entire video.
01:48:19 Just one of his faces.
01:48:21 I just want to see his face.
01:48:23 But he's so pixel-y.
01:48:25 I like his dance.
01:48:27 He's a happy fellow.
01:48:29 Yeah, he's not going to be too happy when he's dead.
01:48:33 Come on, Zekrom.
01:48:35 Hang in there.
01:48:37 Oh, God, Leechsea is so good.
01:48:39 Look at this, Zekrom.
01:48:41 Zekrom is a
01:48:43 dragon electric.
01:48:49 Nice job, dude.
01:48:59 How do you have two?
01:49:01 I just do, dude.
01:49:05 How did you have two citrus berries?
01:49:07 Oh, you got harvest.
01:49:09 I just do, dude.
01:49:11 You got harvest.
01:49:13 I just do, dude.
01:49:15 The rest of my team
01:49:17 is not prepared to deal with Executor.
01:49:19 Executor?
01:49:21 I'm not
01:49:23 prepared for this.
01:49:25 It doesn't count.
01:49:27 Shit.
01:49:29 Shit.
01:49:31 Well, you know,
01:49:33 you know what they say,
01:49:35 if you can't eat them, beat them.
01:49:37 Well, you can eat them.
01:49:39 He's a coconut.
01:49:41 What?
01:49:43 I don't understand this at all.
01:49:45 You can eat coconuts all day.
01:49:49 It's a ferraligator.
01:49:51 Yes.
01:49:53 There's now Ode his name,
01:49:55 so I don't like it.
01:50:03 Check him a little typey charty.
01:50:05 Yeah.
01:50:07 The news is not good.
01:50:09 But maybe.
01:50:13 Wait.
01:50:15 Wait.
01:50:17 Nobody will wait.
01:50:19 No, it's bad.
01:50:21 It's all bad.
01:50:23 Okay, I've only got one choice,
01:50:25 and I am...
01:50:27 Oh, my God.
01:50:29 Why don't those two work together?
01:50:31 Never mind.
01:50:33 No!
01:50:35 Oh, wow.
01:50:37 How the fuck?
01:50:39 That was quite the meatier.
01:50:43 Didn't do shit.
01:50:45 Also, why is my...
01:50:47 Why is my...
01:50:49 Why is my special attack not...
01:50:51 Oh, it's because it wasn't here.
01:50:53 No, man.
01:50:55 See?
01:50:57 Ironhead.
01:50:59 What the fuck?
01:51:01 Oh, it's running around on you.
01:51:05 Straight from chuckling to what?
01:51:09 God damn it.
01:51:11 Come on, come on, come on, boy.
01:51:13 Ah, shit.
01:51:15 What is that?
01:51:17 Mellowetta?
01:51:19 I've never seen a Mellowetta before,
01:51:21 but it is fucking cool.
01:51:23 Is that a legendary? I hope it's not.
01:51:25 Yeah, it is.
01:51:27 It's a mythical.
01:51:29 It looks like a little Indian girl,
01:51:33 like a Native American,
01:51:35 with feathers in her hair, you know?
01:51:37 Yeah, a little band.
01:51:39 No, it's me.
01:51:41 No, it's me, too.
01:51:43 Thanks, Dad.
01:51:45 Thanks, Dad, for saying that you know.
01:51:47 Here we go.
01:51:49 Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
01:51:51 Oh, that was...
01:51:53 What is it with meatiers of not being effective
01:51:55 and how can people just throw actual meatiers
01:51:57 into the planet
01:51:59 without ruining everybody?
01:52:01 It should be illegal, you know.
01:52:03 Draco Meteor is a special attack?
01:52:05 What the fuck?
01:52:07 Dragon Dance raises attack,
01:52:09 but Draco Meteor is a special attack.
01:52:11 What a broken game.
01:52:13 What a broken game.
01:52:15 It is a broken game.
01:52:17 It doesn't even work.
01:52:19 Dude, I unboxed this game
01:52:21 from my loot crate,
01:52:23 and dude, not even fucking...
01:52:25 I'm refunding it.
01:52:27 Yes!
01:52:29 I didn't think that would actually work.
01:52:31 It's 4 vs 3.
01:52:33 Well, Ben has one Pokemon he hasn't shown yet.
01:52:35 I want to see what it is.
01:52:37 I really...
01:52:39 Show it, show it, show it, show it.
01:52:41 Ben?
01:52:43 No.
01:52:45 Come on.
01:52:47 What if it's really good?
01:52:49 I flinched him.
01:52:51 I did it, though.
01:52:53 Show it, show it, show it.
01:52:55 We gotta see it.
01:52:57 Oh, it's Luna.
01:52:59 It's Luna.
01:53:01 It's Luna.
01:53:03 I actually like that Pokemon.
01:53:05 It's funny.
01:53:07 It's got a beak.
01:53:09 Oh, I think...
01:53:11 Yep.
01:53:13 Okay.
01:53:15 Here we go.
01:53:17 I don't know what aura break means.
01:53:19 Come on.
01:53:21 Come on.
01:53:23 Yes, yes.
01:53:25 Can I do it? Oh, no!
01:53:27 Oh, wait, no.
01:53:29 I'm super fucked.
01:53:31 I'm super fucked because your last Pokemon
01:53:33 is whatever name is.
01:53:35 Silvio, hey.
01:53:37 Sephiroth.
01:53:39 Use meteor again.
01:53:45 No, no, no, no, no.
01:53:47 Oh.
01:53:49 Da-da-da-da-da.
01:53:51 Shit.
01:53:53 What a weird wish to have.
01:53:55 I wish for more hit points.
01:53:57 Why did you just wish for the other Pokemon to die?
01:53:59 I agree.
01:54:03 Pokemon don't know what's best for them.
01:54:11 Well, this could go
01:54:13 every single direction.
01:54:15 But upward,
01:54:17 because I don't really like that.
01:54:19 I don't like...
01:54:21 I like getting it up
01:54:23 in a sexual way.
01:54:25 Oh, dear.
01:54:27 This is it.
01:54:29 This is the one.
01:54:31 Whoever wins this wins the whole thing.
01:54:33 Doesn't even matter about the other ones.
01:54:35 Only now do you know this.
01:54:37 What are my options?
01:54:39 Oh, no!
01:54:41 Oh, my God.
01:54:43 I have a choice band!
01:54:45 No!
01:54:47 What's that?
01:54:49 I shouldn't have said that.
01:54:51 I'm dead.
01:54:53 I can't believe it.
01:54:55 I can't believe it.
01:54:57 Then one anyway.
01:54:59 Yeah.
01:55:01 Damn it.
01:55:03 Shit.
01:55:05 I really screwed the pooch on this one.
01:55:07 You want to do another one?
01:55:09 One more.
01:55:11 Random battle?
01:55:13 Yeah, of course.
01:55:15 There's no such thing as not random battles.
01:55:17 Check it out, dude.
01:55:19 It's Goo Goo.
01:55:25 What a Goo at Pokemon.
01:55:27 Nope.
01:55:31 Not actually.
01:55:33 It has been Goo'd.
01:55:35 Ew, it's dripping.
01:55:37 I love how it's dripping.
01:55:39 Yeah, I love how it's 3D model actually drips.
01:55:43 Look at this piece of shit I have.
01:55:45 I'm just going to send it out so I can die.
01:55:49 Oof-a-zant.
01:55:51 Look at this meme.
01:55:53 Wait.
01:55:55 That's like a turkey.
01:55:57 Damn it.
01:55:59 What the fuck is tailwind?
01:56:01 It doubles your entire team's speed.
01:56:03 Oh.
01:56:05 That's cool, I guess.
01:56:07 I don't know if it lasts if you switch.
01:56:09 There's three turns.
01:56:11 It doesn't.
01:56:13 So it lasts through switching.
01:56:15 God damn it, Goodra.
01:56:17 Dude, just gotta-
01:56:19 Goodra, would you please?
01:56:21 Please, Goodra.
01:56:23 Goodra, would you fucking please?
01:56:25 Just work with me.
01:56:27 Goodra, why?
01:56:29 I shouldn't have stayed in this long.
01:56:39 Okay, yeah, it's fine then.
01:56:43 No, actually that sucks.
01:56:45 Yeah.
01:56:47 Oh, fuck, I'm sorry.
01:56:51 He's got extra smooths.
01:56:59 Whoa.
01:57:01 Hey, come on.
01:57:03 That's so cold.
01:57:05 Get it together.
01:57:09 You know, I'd sully this commentary with-
01:57:13 I wanted to throw you off your guard.
01:57:15 Get your act together right now.
01:57:19 Oh, Samorot.
01:57:23 Oh, but I shot you.
01:57:25 Uh...
01:57:27 Die.
01:57:29 I will fucking die.
01:57:37 Sellaby again.
01:57:39 Yeah.
01:57:41 Ooh, Altaria, it's a big fluffy baby.
01:57:43 Correct.
01:57:47 Took me a second and I had to cough,
01:57:49 but I've come to the conclusion that yes, you were right.
01:57:51 Um, um, um, um, um...
01:57:53 We're just looking at it.
01:57:55 It's just so cool.
01:57:57 I've never seen better.
01:57:59 Seen better what?
01:58:01 Seen better what and where and when?
01:58:03 So I can go and I can kill it so I can be number one.
01:58:05 Big, big fluffy wings.
01:58:07 They're hypnotizing.
01:58:13 It's the floatiest ass Pokemon I've ever seen.
01:58:17 Why's it got to be down on the ground?
01:58:19 Oh, shit.
01:58:21 Why did I do that? It was foolish.
01:58:23 It was foolhardy and I should be shot.
01:58:25 You, you, you've, you've done it now.
01:58:29 Check this shit right out, Boyo.
01:58:33 Bam.
01:58:35 Whoa, it's even fluffier.
01:58:37 Look how big.
01:58:39 That's all I have to say.
01:58:41 Look how big.
01:58:43 Look how big.
01:58:45 That is the biggest fluff I've ever seen.
01:58:47 I've...
01:58:49 No!
01:58:51 Don't kill it.
01:58:53 It's too cute to die.
01:58:55 Here.
01:58:57 It's too cute to die.
01:58:59 Here.
01:59:01 Here.
01:59:03 Oh, thought you would switch.
01:59:05 Yeah.
01:59:07 Why would I, why on earth?
01:59:09 I...
01:59:11 I don't know.
01:59:13 It's so foolish.
01:59:15 Okay. Okay, though.
01:59:17 Alright, this, this battle is for the entire thing.
01:59:21 Yeah.
01:59:23 No.
01:59:25 No, come on.
01:59:27 You can just say I, that didn't count, but I'll work.
01:59:29 This isn't, this isn't real.
01:59:31 Well, of course it's not, because it's a Porygon.
01:59:35 Porygon.
01:59:37 How did, how did they render Porygon to, so...
01:59:41 No!
01:59:43 They just put him inside the computer.
01:59:45 They just put him inside the computer.
01:59:47 Yeah.
01:59:49 Oh, yeah.
01:59:51 Oh, it's, it's, it's, it's you.
01:59:53 Yeah, it's waifu, dude.
01:59:55 It's clear fabley.
01:59:57 No!
01:59:59 More like dead fable.
02:00:01 That was a fable of a previous time of the past.
02:00:03 In the past it's dead, it's gone.
02:00:05 Yeah.
02:00:07 As in dictionary.
02:00:09 You're gonna be like the history books.
02:00:11 I don't have anything.
02:00:13 Oh, shit, is, won't she gonna come away with a win after all this?
02:00:17 Will he win?
02:00:19 Yeah.
02:00:21 Oh, this is funny.
02:00:23 Syllaby, use rape.
02:00:25 It's super effective.
02:00:27 Super effective.
02:00:29 Against the matriarchy.
02:00:35 It's Armaldo, that's pretty cool.
02:00:37 He's got funny eyes.
02:00:39 Why are all my pokemons slow, asshole?
02:00:43 Like all of them were fucking slow.
02:00:45 They were all super slow.
02:00:47 Is that a fucking emperor?
02:00:49 Is that a fucking emperor?
02:00:51 He's dead.
02:00:53 And Munchy takes the victory!
02:00:55 Get out.
02:00:57 Get, get out.
02:00:59 Munchy for the ultimate win.
02:01:01 We didn't even see the other Pokemon yet.
02:01:03 What other Pokemon did you have?
02:01:05 It was...
02:01:07 Samurai and that, that light fish.
02:01:09 It was, it was some fucking bitch.
02:01:11 And a bird.
02:01:13 And it was another bitch, and it was another bitch.
02:01:15 Ben, it's been great playing with you, but you know,
02:01:17 if you mess with the best,
02:01:19 then you get the horns.
02:01:23 Oh, god.
02:01:25 Well, the ultimate winner is...
02:01:27 is Munchy.
02:01:29 Yep, everyone, press one in chat if I do throw in Ben,
02:01:31 and even though he beat me,
02:01:33 in some battles it's not good.
02:01:35 Everyone, press one in chat,
02:01:37 if I'm gonna seal Ben away in my cage.
02:01:39 My cage is shaved.
02:01:41 Munchy, I work so hard.
02:01:43 Don't take it away from me.
02:01:45 Don't take it away from me.
02:01:47 We'll let the viewers decide by their ones.
02:01:49 Their ones will seal you away.
02:01:51 Forever.
02:01:53 You know, Yu-Gi-Oh, that's gonna be you.
02:01:55 Just buried in a mountain of ones.
02:01:59 Just fucked over.
02:02:01 Just fucked over and over by ones.
02:02:03 Guys, I forgot to let the viewers know,
02:02:05 but if I won, then you had to make Vincent real,
02:02:07 so you better get on with it.
02:02:09 Oh, that's right.
02:02:11 The deal that I never agreed to,
02:02:13 but which I will nevertheless honor,
02:02:15 because of what an honorable samurai I am,
02:02:17 is that if I won...
02:02:19 Wait, what the fuck was it?
02:02:21 If I won...
02:02:23 No, no, no, no, no.
02:02:25 If I won, you have to make Vincent real from your comic,
02:02:27 and if you win, then I get to make you
02:02:29 Ben-Saint real,
02:02:31 Ben-Saint real.
02:02:33 If I win,
02:02:35 then you get to make me real.
02:02:39 Yeah, I remember.
02:02:41 Okay, deal's a deal.
02:02:43 Vincent is coming to a store near you.
02:02:45 Not as a product,
02:02:47 just as a guy.
02:02:49 You'll see him in a store.
02:02:51 He'll be buying something.
02:02:53 At one time, the beta uprising
02:02:55 will truly begin.
02:02:57 It will.
02:02:59 It already has.
02:03:03 Our anti-sex crusade begins now.
02:03:07 My name is not important.
02:03:09 One of the important is what I'm going to do.
02:03:11 I was just about to quote that
02:03:13 drill tweet about the Brexit asexual again,
02:03:15 but then I remember that I already did.
02:03:17 I already said the Brexit asexual.
02:03:19 It's such a good...
02:03:21 Okay, I don't know how to end this.
02:03:23 Alright, alright.
02:03:25 I've had a fan...
02:03:27 Yeah, it's been a good time.
02:03:29 And you know what?
02:03:31 I never competitively battled before,
02:03:33 but in the days that I spent training
02:03:35 for this engagement, I got really into it
02:03:37 and it was really cool.
02:03:39 It was way easier to get into
02:03:41 than I thought it would be.
02:03:43 I thought it would take weeks or months.
02:03:45 I thought it would be like League of Legends
02:03:47 where you can play your whole life
02:03:49 and still be a piece of shit.
02:03:51 No, I just looked up some stuff
02:03:53 and figured it out.
02:03:55 Well, it's partly team setup
02:03:57 and then everything beyond that is mind games.
02:03:59 It's just Minecraft.
02:04:01 Yeah.
02:04:03 If you're going to play anything with them,
02:04:05 play Terraria.
02:04:07 It's much better.
02:04:09 I played that years ago.
02:04:11 Get the Pokemon mode for Terraria.
02:04:13 There will be Pokemon.
02:04:15 Yes, exactly.
02:04:17 Okay.
02:04:19 Alright, let's get the fuck out of here.
02:04:21 This has been the rowdy fucking cop killer.
02:04:23 No, the rowdy fuckers cop killers.
02:04:25 Fuckers cop killers
02:04:27 with Ben St. and Munchy Shatsky.
02:04:29 Yeah.
02:04:31 Oh, no.
02:04:33 Munchy Shatsky.
02:04:35 Another one.
02:04:37 Full name, Munchy Shatsky.
02:04:39 And Hippocrite.
02:04:41 Acting as...
02:04:43 Orlando, Florida.
02:04:45 That's his last name.
02:04:47 Orlando Blue.
02:04:49 Alright, are we calling it?
