00:00:00 Hi, Ben from the future here with a, I think this episode merits a bit of explanation. You see, you know, as every commenter has pointed out, the PCP has been a little bit, a little bit low energy lately, a little bit, a little bit low attendance lately.
00:00:22 You know, it's just been, just been some quiet, intimate, one on one, one on one on one kind of little conversations, just about whatever I want to talk about.
00:00:32 And that is obviously a huge, huge problem. So instead we decided, we decided to swing the pendulum hard, well I decided, this is me, it's my fault, blame me.
00:00:44 Swing the pendulum hard the other way, and say, no, fuck that, high energy, everybody, get in here, so I, you know, I had a couple of vodka gimlets, and I decided to put out a tweet saying, who wants to be on the next PCP episode?
00:01:02 And that's what this is. This is PCP episode 200 and whatever. Oops, all guests addition. Anyone who wanted to be on the podcast? Here they are. On the freaking podcast. I hope you enjoy the high energy that is about to ensue.
00:01:21 Power to the people, you're welcome. Oh, but anyway, before we get underway, I want you to know that this episode is actually seven different episodes because the guests were split into teams.
00:01:35 They were invited to separate themselves into six colored teams, red, blue, yellow, green, pink, purple, before the episode began.
00:01:42 I did not explain to them what the teams would be used for, but in the end, we split up the team, or the guests into groups, and then went group to group to group, having conversations, doing voicemails, doing a little chit chat, having a little sesh.
00:02:00 So we have the main episode that follows me, Tom, and Gibb going group to group to group talking to everyone, but we also have the separate editions. We have red edition, yellow edition, blue edition, etc.
00:02:14 That is just the groups chat alone, including the parts that me, Tom, and Gibb were in. So if you want to hear, we have a we have a little like a like light through a prism. This episode is split split into a rainbow, a rainbow of content for your enjoyment.
00:02:33 So we'll put this, we'll include a link to a playlist of all the different teams. There'll be link link in the description. So if you are interested to hear each individual team and what they talked about during this clusterfuck of an episode, there you go.
00:02:49 There'll be down there in the, in the, in the box. Just, just a heads up. Okay. Without further ado, let's, let's get this show pony on the road, pony. Baby.
00:03:07 One more time. Three, two, one, sing. Okay. And remember, do not leave the call at the end until we sync at the end again. Very important.
00:03:20 Welcome to the pro crass podcast. We're on, we're live, we're doing it. It's the, oh God, how did all these fucking people get in here?
00:03:51 Ben saying, and we've got, we got Tom Oliver, we got Gibb and take, and we have like 40 other people.
00:03:58 People are saying that was decided to remedy that by inviting everyone on.
00:04:09 Everyone said, oh, oh, where, oh, where's Jeff? And you know what, we've got, we've got better, we've got better options now.
00:04:19 All those people are in the past. This is the future. And the future belongs to the people.
00:04:30 As someone could say, we're better than they.
00:04:34 Ah, yes. The people's favorite.
00:04:51 So, um, all right. Topics, suggestions, everyone.
00:04:59 We're going to need some order in here.
00:05:09 Guys, we're really going to need some order in here. Everybody's going to need to quiet down.
00:05:12 Guys, we're flamboyant. Are you sure you go to voicemails?
00:05:14 Yeah.
00:05:18 How about voicemails? It just is the topic.
00:05:21 I have a question. You guys are all, you guys could all like give a voicemail live inside the call.
00:05:27 Yeah.
00:05:31 Too much pressure.
00:05:34 Can we go to voicemails?
00:05:36 We've got a lot of ladies.
00:05:40 This is a very good game.
00:05:42 We've got the voicemail team.
00:05:48 I got it.
00:05:50 I love the energy and I want to say this is exactly what the PCP has been missing lately.
00:06:15 I feel refreshed. I feel energized. I feel empowered. I feel emboldened.
00:06:19 Do we dare to go like down the list and like have everyone introduce themselves?
00:06:41 I think I want to do that. I think we can do it.
00:06:44 Let's start at the top.
00:06:47 Bring back the interview.
00:06:49 No, shut up.

00:07:55 Oh my god.
00:07:56 She's a long time.
00:07:57 I don't even know what you mean, Quinn.
00:07:58 Why would you say C-Tool?
00:07:59 I don't care.
00:08:00 I don't care.
00:08:01 It's just funny.
00:08:02 She doesn't care.
00:08:03 I'm C-Tool.
00:08:04 She's too old.
00:08:05 I'm C-Tool.
00:08:06 But you might know me, but I'll ask the person who makes you want to die.
00:08:11 I don't know.

00:08:34 Who's FAP Tony M?
00:08:35 What are you doing?
00:08:36 That would be me.
00:08:37 I'm here because I sock Ben on Twitter.
00:08:40 Yeah.
00:08:41 How my life is gone.
00:08:43 Yeah.
00:08:44 Follow Ben on Twitter.
00:08:46 Follow my hot takes on Twitter for more of that.
00:08:49 No, don't do it.
00:08:51 No, don't do it.
00:08:52 Hap Chocomoto.
00:08:53 How are you?
00:08:54 You know, I'm doing good.
00:08:56 I'm that fucking duck Chocomoto.
00:08:58 I'm repping my purple bros.
00:09:00 That's it.
00:09:01 Hey-oh.
00:09:02 Purple bros.
00:09:03 We will talk about this later, but we did.
00:09:05 We are divided into teams.
00:09:07 We do have races, if you will.
00:09:09 Races, if you will.
00:09:10 We do have allegiances.
00:09:11 Yeah.
00:09:12 But we'll raise war.
00:09:15 Who's up next?
00:09:16 Hap Duncun.
00:09:17 Hi, I'm Duncun.
00:09:18 I'm also not a daddy anyway.
00:09:20 I am the most racist.
00:09:21 I run the purple team and we will destroy the other teams
00:09:24 because they're different colors.
00:09:25 Raise war.
00:09:26 Raise war.
00:09:27 Raise war.
00:09:28 Raise war.
00:09:29 Raise war.
00:09:30 Raise war.
00:09:31 Base war.
00:09:32 Nice chance to be a purple team.
00:09:34 Very coordinating.
00:09:36 Hap Eleazar slash FER.
00:09:39 Who the fuck are you?
00:09:41 I'm the editor of the PCP.
00:09:43 Ben, why do you do this to me?
00:09:44 How do you prepare for me to edit this episode?
00:09:46 My beauty is going to blow.
00:09:48 We have an editor?
00:09:50 We have a podcast?
00:09:53 Don't edit anything.
00:09:56 Just put all the audio files together.
00:09:59 And that's the episode.
00:10:01 Don't do anything.
00:10:02 Oh, yeah.
00:10:03 It's so fun.
00:10:04 Yeah.
00:10:05 Yeah.
00:10:06 Eleazar is so easy.
00:10:07 Like, what are you even talking about?
00:10:09 Yeah.
00:10:10 Like, what do you do?
00:10:11 What do you do?
00:10:12 I'm making a joke about not having an editor.
00:10:14 So why don't you make this episode sound like we don't?
00:10:17 Perfect.
00:10:18 Kajorah Bitterthorn.
00:10:20 It's just going to be why Kajorah Bitterthorn.
00:10:22 Tell me.
00:10:23 Hap Kajorah Bitterthorn.
00:10:24 Introduce yourself.
00:10:25 Explain yourself.
00:10:26 What's up, guys?
00:10:28 Kajorah Bitterthorn here.
00:10:29 Your local crypto aristocrat and waifu coin whale.
00:10:34 Hell yeah.
00:10:35 Vessel waifu coin.
00:10:36 I just look up.
00:10:37 He's also brown.
00:10:38 Same.
00:10:39 Yes.
00:10:41 No need, bro.
00:10:43 Who are you?
00:10:44 Yes.
00:10:45 I'm here to also wrap the purple team.
00:10:47 Procrastinator's Anonymous is better.
00:10:50 Procrastinator's Anonymous swiftly colonized the purple team,
00:10:57 leading to a huge power imbalance that will have repercussions throughout history.
00:11:02 Yeah.
00:11:03 Yeah.
00:11:04 Rito Torpedo also, Pap.
00:11:06 What's up?
00:11:07 Yes, yes.
00:11:08 I majored in offensive cooming and I have a minor in phrenology.
00:11:16 With a pedigree like that, you're doomed to be a barista, I think.
00:11:20 Bazinga.
00:11:21 No barista.
00:11:24 No barista.
00:11:26 Yeah.
00:11:27 Pap Shondan.
00:11:28 How's it going?
00:11:30 Hey, guys.
00:11:31 I'm a big gamer, notorious gamer, big Yu-Gi-Oh head.
00:11:36 That's also what I'm known as.
00:11:37 I'm also a big proponent of the N word, because I am the king of the Nate heads.
00:11:43 Fuck them.
00:11:44 Fuck Nate heads.
00:11:45 Oh, no.
00:11:46 Amen to that.
00:11:47 The real N word.
00:11:48 That took a good twist.
00:11:51 Yeah.
00:11:52 We all got nervous, but humor is the relief of tension.
00:11:58 So you create that tension, then your relief, and everyone goes, ah, ha, ha, ha.
00:12:03 And we're in that way.
00:12:05 It's just like bad sex that could have been worse.
00:12:10 Pat Kodow.
00:12:16 Pat Zach Def, what's up?
00:12:18 Yeah, sup man.
00:12:19 This is going to be hell.
00:12:20 I'm sorry.
00:12:21 Yeah.
00:12:22 Yeah.
00:12:23 He's so silly, so funny.
00:12:25 I wanted to die.
00:12:26 That concludes the anonymous proportion of the introductions.
00:12:31 Yeah.
00:12:32 See you next episode.
00:12:35 Yeah, that's it.
00:12:36 Boop Mozilla Fennekin, what are you doing here?
00:12:39 That's a good question.
00:12:40 How did I get in here?
00:12:42 It's all because I finally got out of voice jail.
00:12:44 Hooray.
00:12:45 Thank you.
00:12:46 I would like to thank the Academy.
00:12:47 Thanks.
00:12:48 And now I'm starting my own podcast.
00:12:49 I am the sole representative of the podcast of old fashioned piss shitting.
00:12:54 Thank you.
00:12:55 How did you get out of voice jail again?
00:12:58 You bailed me out.
00:12:59 Who the fuck?
00:13:00 I bailed myself out, actually.
00:13:02 On the stream?
00:13:03 Was that from the stream?
00:13:04 Yeah.
00:13:05 It's all thanks to Black Lives.
00:13:06 The stream that destroyed the channel, you know.
00:13:08 Yeah.
00:13:09 The stream that got it.
00:13:10 Hey, Bev, who are you again?
00:13:14 I'm here to rep the yellow team and the real purple team, the cop killers.
00:13:19 Yes.
00:13:20 Just going to say, it's almost just a school certainty.
00:13:23 Someone here has coronavirus and that's pretty funny.
00:13:26 Yeah.
00:13:28 Is it, is it, do you think so?
00:13:31 How likely do you think there's 50 people?
00:13:35 Or something like that, 40.
00:13:37 Oh, maybe in the server, not in the call.
00:13:39 Oh, it's a good one.
00:13:41 Fun fact.
00:13:42 If you cough into your microphone, you give people computer viruses instead.
00:13:46 Oh, no.
00:13:47 Gabe, why would you even make it when you have people to cough on their mic?
00:13:51 Like, yeah.
00:13:52 The podcast is very dangerous.
00:13:54 Please don't.
00:13:55 Everyone start coughing on their mic right now.
00:13:57 That would be so terrible.
00:14:00 This is the place.
00:14:04 Come now.
00:14:05 Okay.
00:14:06 Okay.
00:14:07 Okay.
00:14:08 Okay.
00:14:09 Shut up, everyone.
00:14:10 Hey, Bobby.
00:14:11 Hey, Bobby.
00:14:12 What's up?
00:14:13 What's going on?
00:14:14 What's happening?
00:14:15 I'm just here to rep the pink team today.
00:14:16 I want to say fuck purple team.
00:14:17 None of you guys are funny.
00:14:19 Oh, you can suck my dick.
00:14:20 You're late to a death.
00:14:22 No, no.
00:14:23 Totally not something so beautiful like pink.
00:14:26 Listen, buddy, don't threaten to have me suck your dick.
00:14:29 You'll regret it.
00:14:30 Yeah.
00:14:31 Oh, my God.
00:14:35 This check out really gay real fast.
00:14:37 Hey, what's a chilling chocolate?
00:14:39 I think I've seen, I think I know that guy.
00:14:42 What's up?
00:14:43 I fuck ass.
00:14:44 I shouldn't glass.
00:14:45 I fuck wrong.
00:14:46 Yeah.
00:14:47 I break off.
00:14:48 I'm just here.
00:14:50 To represent the yellow team, the purple team blew their load.
00:14:55 We're already past them.
00:14:56 And now all us yellows can just come together and recognizing purple is a horrible color.
00:15:00 It's for the children of the lie.
00:15:02 Yellows.
00:15:03 I'm all sick of you.
00:15:05 Yeah.
00:15:06 Oh, God, love this.
00:15:10 I preach.
00:15:12 Praise God.
00:15:14 Yep.
00:15:15 CJ, how are you today?
00:15:17 I loved you and GTA.
00:15:20 What?
00:15:23 Is it the fat guy?
00:15:25 No, no.
00:15:26 I didn't get the black guy.
00:15:28 I was thinking the fat guy I was thinking of was also black.
00:15:31 Oh, sorry.
00:15:32 Hard one.
00:15:33 You don't like big smoke.
00:15:35 It's the GTA 5 protagonist.
00:15:37 So like interesting caricature characters.
00:15:42 Um, so anyways, CJ, how you doing?
00:15:45 I'm doing good.
00:15:46 I'm happy to be here to represent the blue team.
00:15:51 Perpetual underdogs, the blue team.
00:15:55 We are the underdogs.
00:15:58 I'm pretty sure we actually have like the least team members.
00:16:02 No, it's green.
00:16:03 It's green.
00:16:04 Is there is?
00:16:06 Well, God knows guys.
00:16:08 Blue team is still better.
00:16:10 Green is a numerical minority, but they have an outsized cultural impact.
00:16:14 They own the entertainment industry.
00:16:16 So it's not a creative color.
00:16:19 Guilty as trash.
00:16:21 Uh, hey, Dan.
00:16:23 What's the big smoke doing?
00:16:25 Hello there.
00:16:26 I just wanted to say that can we please make the thumbnail for this episode
00:16:29 that one image of Homer in the bar with all the,
00:16:31 No, you can't.
00:16:32 No, we can't.
00:16:33 Homer in the bar with all the what?
00:16:35 All the people around and he's just so cramped and uncomfortable.
00:16:38 Post it.
00:16:39 Post it in general.
00:16:40 I don't know the senior talk.
00:16:43 I am in favor generally of, um, Simpsons posting.
00:16:47 Yeah.
00:16:48 Great idea.
00:16:49 But Eleazar, can you edit the faces of each Simpsons character to all of our faces?
00:16:53 Yeah.
00:16:54 I want exactly this many figures on the thumbnail.
00:17:04 I want each one to be discernible at a glance in the side.
00:17:07 Can you deep fake the entire episode to their faces?
00:17:12 I like the idea.
00:17:13 Jamele boss being our favorite.
00:17:16 Icon on the screen.
00:17:19 This is like cats where the whole thing is just introduction.
00:17:22 Come on.
00:17:23 I, all right.
00:17:24 All right.
00:17:25 All right.
00:17:26 Fan base.
00:17:27 Hey, who's that fan base?
00:17:28 What's up?
00:17:29 I made his video.
00:17:31 Okay.
00:17:33 Okay.
00:17:34 I thought you were silent for a second.
00:17:39 You edit videos.
00:17:40 Who would do such a thing?
00:17:42 That's a bad reaction.
00:17:46 Fan base is lagging a little bit.
00:17:53 Maybe it's like far away from my microphone.
00:17:56 That might be it.
00:17:57 Oh, there you are.
00:17:59 I was just leaning back.
00:18:01 But I guess I can't do that.
00:18:03 Oh, maybe that's why you're quiet.
00:18:05 Okay.
00:18:06 It's like, it just takes so long for my voice to reach the microphone.
00:18:09 I'm speaking through a tin can to connect to do a string from like my neighbor's tree
00:18:16 house.
00:18:17 It's been a little loopy.
00:18:19 It's been a little loopy.
00:18:21 It's a sound wave.
00:18:22 It moves slower here in England.
00:18:25 I'm not sure if this person joined.
00:18:27 We have been saints now.
00:18:29 One of those fun Google.
00:18:30 Yeah.
00:18:31 Yeah.
00:18:32 No, the other one.
00:18:36 Wait, who is that?
00:18:38 I think they joined.
00:18:39 It's been saying, duh.
00:18:41 Who are you?
00:18:43 Wait, can we just all.
00:18:45 Wait, wait, wait.
00:18:47 This person's verified.
00:18:48 This person's blue.
00:18:49 So they should be.
00:18:51 No.
00:18:52 I don't think he's not recording.
00:18:54 Are you?
00:18:55 Are you sure?
00:18:56 He hasn't said anything at all.
00:18:58 Yeah.
00:18:59 By the way, I think.
00:19:01 Okay.
00:19:02 Yeah.
00:19:03 Wait, what?
00:19:04 Greg.
00:19:05 That's over.
00:19:06 Killed.
00:19:07 Well, I mean, okay.
00:19:09 I mean, whatever.
00:19:11 It's fine.
00:19:12 It's fine.
00:19:13 No, no.
00:19:14 It's been.
00:19:15 We can all be bent.

00:37:26 Continue I love you Tom. Toya. Hey, Toya
00:37:33 Hey, my name is Toya. I'm a voice actor. Yeah
00:37:38 Wanna fucking kill myself I entered this call an hour ago, and I am convinced that this is what hell is
00:37:47 Remember we decided teams for this. Yeah, me too
00:37:56 I think
00:38:02 I
00:38:04 Just made a tweet
00:38:07 Anyone want to be in this he's a pause for a second to give the actual backstory for how this happened, right?
00:38:12 I think I'm staying up really fucking late all week
00:38:17 In the morning Ben adds everyone in the procrastinators chat. This is the idea. I'm pitching if nobody says no, I'm doing it
00:38:26 No one responds because it's more in the morning. He's like I'm doing it
00:38:33 I
00:38:40 Different person okay drunk
00:38:43 It's completely unrelated to sober Ben and sober Ben cannot take responsibility for any of his actions. Thank you
00:38:52 It's not our fault
00:38:56 I don't I don't know if that's true, and I have no way to confirm
00:39:03 Okay, here's what I'm gonna do unless anyone begs me to stop and even then they really have to milk it
00:39:09 I'm really appealed to my kinder nature. I'm gonna put out an open call
00:39:13 Anyone who wants to be a guest in the PCP
00:39:15 Having an all-guest episode
00:39:18 Members are too busy with so many lofty pursuits
00:39:24 And you know what why should I deny them base base base for 25 a.m. Okay
00:39:32 This is
00:39:39 According here
00:39:44 This is not a troller meme
00:39:51 No, no, that can't be that does sound like something I would say and do
00:39:57 It's time to talk about how big Clarissa is and how much she can crush me. So, okay, I'll go first
00:40:03 I'm sweet mouse and I'm like very small so I could be extra crushed by Clarissa
00:40:14 You will try
00:40:19 If Melissa would be able to crash them I think that sounds like a good use of time
00:40:26 Here
00:40:30 Big tits are fucking disgusting small tits are way better
00:40:33 Oh
00:40:51 We can talk with we can talk about teams, you know, I'm actually reconsidering the whole team idea
00:41:03 I
00:41:09 Was playing what was your plan initially well my initial plan was I didn't have a plan and I was just gonna think of something to do
00:41:22 I was considering
00:41:23 separating you all into teams and then like in a in a twist like like turning around and turning you all against one another and like
00:41:30 Isolating you and like forcing you to like do some sort of like prisoners dilemma like everyone
00:41:36 Caps a secret vote on which of their teammates is getting like kicked from the call next
00:41:47 Except only for the purple team
00:41:53 Sounds like a great idea the rest of us will totally fall
00:42:00 And they want to do the podcast with us
00:42:03 Actually do a fucking podcast that is quality. Wow doing a podcast a very
00:42:09 Quality are literally like those are mutually exclusive terms
00:42:20 You never got to experience
00:42:31 I'm running in her
00:42:34 ASMR episode was a masterpiece
00:42:42 One person every two minutes until there is only like two people in the call
00:42:55 Give and take how's the how's the Tezuka contest how's your drawing going?
00:43:00 Watch the fuck
00:43:03 Subscribe to streams put bits in the jar, but it's getting it's a page
00:43:09 Out of 50 and so the I think by Wednesday, I should be done with a line art on Friday. I might be done with the whole thing
00:43:17 Do you actually like cut out all the panels you needed to to make it a coherent with the within the constraints?
00:43:24 It's coherent enough like like the the story is unfinished
00:43:29 Like the story that I'm set out to make it goes to page 50 where
00:43:35 Something bad happens and it could be continued, but it also could be like a bad ending
00:43:41 Yeah
00:43:44 Oh, no, how will she get out like in the real story there's
00:43:48 Explanations for that but for the Tezuka that's 50 page 50 and I'm like I'm cutting it off there
00:43:53 I'm gonna submit it if they say it's not a satisfying ending
00:43:56 I'm gonna nod my head and say Ohio because I must and that'll be that
00:44:00 Thank you. Thank you. I got a question. You might be spoilers. So like
00:44:05 Feel free to not answer but do we find out what's up with the hat?
00:44:11 Do we find out what's up with the hat?
00:44:15 No, the guy's hat I
00:44:19 Want to know what it's deal is
00:44:22 There's I mean
00:44:24 Initially like when I was sketching it out
00:44:26 I was like, it's just he's just a guy with a like he's he's the bandit king
00:44:30 So he's the king of the bandits so he's got a hat that looks kind of like a crown
00:44:34 But then I drew an eye on it and I'm like hmm
00:44:37 Laura potential so I won't answer the question
00:44:46 I got a question for Tom. Oh someone else is talking. What was that? Yeah, let the Australian speak

00:46:23 She's nine feet tall and she's nine feet thick
00:46:30 From a certain angle, yes
00:46:32 Hey, Tom, I really been waiting on a
00:46:35 On you know a new tablet review to come out when when's when he's like that Mike

00:46:55 In the description
00:46:58 Podcast I could if everyone's missing my patreon podcast
00:47:02 I'm telling you there's like 60 of them now. They come out every week not every month like these fucking lollygaggers over here
00:47:08 I only have so much to talk about. I'm not very interested. That's why you just
00:47:23 What was I'm addressing me no when is when is the been st. Livestreams gonna come back. I miss them
00:47:30 I
00:47:31 Yeah, I
00:47:34 I think they're probably gonna come back kind of soon cuz like I'm I finished the thing
00:47:39 Yeah, no, I
00:47:41 Wait, I finished slime and punishment and I'm gonna put out the sonichi lecture like pretty soon
00:47:46 Yeah, and after that. Oh god, there was like one other thing but like after that. I'm like
00:47:55 I have a little more
00:47:57 I'm like I'm like done and I'm like
00:48:05 Yeah, excuse me
00:48:13 Every now and then I just fucking finish season one of the Winnie the Pooh
00:48:22 I think I might I think I might I don't know
00:48:27 Yeah, they really are the best
00:48:39 You gotta make the you gotta make the Winnie the Pooh analysis so you two
00:48:43 Like you do the exact same thing you do you do the exact same thing you did before but then you say and that's why the left is right
00:48:57 My biases I feel I feel like the Winnie the Pooh videos were like overly there was like a they were like
00:49:04 Disproportionately liked like like a lot of people seem to really like them for some reason which is weird because they don't do very well
00:49:10 But like a lot of a lot of people are like they say like if asked they would like I would love you to please
00:49:15 Do do more of those. I don't know. I don't know why they seem to appeal
00:49:27 They didn't go viral
00:49:30 They're Winnie the Pooh who was craving Winnie the Pooh analysis. They're good. So I mean if you make a long enough one
00:49:40 Like anything can get big it just like I feel like it's it's not the sort of thing that would become viral
00:49:47 And and like and like skyrocket
00:49:51 It's the sort of thing that like over many years of consistent uploads suddenly everybody
00:49:56 Realizes it and then they go back and watch all of the things
00:50:04 Then make it make like a video at the end that is like a big
00:50:09 Yeah, just combine the videos or something
00:50:11 Yeah, put them all in one big video call it like the definitive Winnie the Pooh analysis and it'll get like four million views
00:50:17 Literally, yes
00:50:25 Like Winnie the Pooh was deeper than you thought
00:50:33 But it's not it's not though
00:50:55 It's how much
00:50:59 When they realize they'll be able to watch
00:51:02 You could see me lie about events that happened in between the lines. Come on. We need a poo and cap. Call the video
00:51:09 Call the video why eor betrays the depression community
00:51:20 Down the rabbit hole, but it's because it's rabbit
00:51:26 Going out instead of like down the honey pot we could we could we could call it like we could call it like like
00:51:33 We could call it like in rabbits back door because like as a reference
00:51:50 Should I do a Winnie the Pooh lecture, I don't know if I be qualified
00:51:56 Down rabbit hole
00:52:09 Down the rabbit hole call it stuck in the rabbit hole as a reference to that classic Winnie the Pooh episode
00:52:17 Oh, no step bro. I'm stuck in the rabbit hole
00:52:20 Tigger this is Kang this is rude. Feel old yet you you have to
00:52:29 So that I get too fat and stuck
00:52:31 That's okay. I see I see an opportunity. I'm taking it. We need a round table everyone all together
00:52:37 We need to shit on
00:52:39 Cassey and she'll for not being here. They said they were in a massive. They're you know, they're terrible people
00:52:45 Literally
00:52:48 Okay, like I'm okay. I'm all for shitting on someone. I have no idea who the identity of us. I'm all for shitting on michelle. Yeah
00:52:57 On three okay may also also wrote on twitter that you won't be in it
00:53:08 I mean, we should be glad that michelle isn't here, right who also said that they want to be on may
00:53:12 Is that what you said?
00:53:27 You should talk about uh slime and punishment releasing, uh, uh, how do you think it turned out? Uh, how was the release?
00:53:33 Oh, yeah, I've been hyping that up for for years. Um
00:53:36 Um
00:53:39 It was on
00:53:40 It was on on the slime during slime fest a debuted slime and punishment finale. It's done. It's out. It's three and a half minutes
00:53:48 Uh, it's got music. It's got music by six in it sounds amazing. It sounds really great for the tracks
00:53:55 Sixten who who tried to be here but couldn't a one minute silence for for six
00:53:59 But why don't you have slime and punishment on your website ben?
00:54:03 It it it is I I put it on it wasn't before but I I updated it
00:54:11 It's um, it's um, and I I think I I keep I watched it a bunch of times back
00:54:16 And I think that I'm really happy with some of the visual especially the part in the time void
00:54:21 I am really happy with how that looks and I feel like I
00:54:25 Kind of I in terms of like putting my vision of what it should be into
00:54:30 Into the video I I nailed it. It looks exactly how I wanted it to
00:54:35 No, can I can I can I drop some critique here some harsh real critique?
00:54:39 Oh, okay. No, no, you know, you know, uh, it was really cool
00:54:44 We had to wait a long time like almost a year for it to drop or something like that
00:54:49 It's not a year. No, no, well like eight months or something. Yeah, like nine months. I mean, yeah
00:54:55 Eight months of work, but it's okay. It is good
00:54:59 Uh, it's like genuinely like
00:55:01 Like it's like I after after ben said that like, oh, it's not as good as I thought it would be after eight months or something
00:55:06 Or not. It's not eight months worth of work. I thought it would be like bad, but no, it's like actually good
00:55:10 Yeah, this is what I said on the last episode is I know it's not eight months worth of work, but I still think it's good
00:55:16 Yeah
00:55:19 Months of time you have to like sleep and eat and live your life while also working on a thing
00:55:24 Yeah, it's like a week and a half, you know
00:55:26 I mean, it should have been a week. It should have been out sooner, but it wasn't so what are you gonna do?
00:55:30 It's fine. Well, but you took the time you needed and that's okay. Don't fucking condescend to me
00:55:36 Don't don't fucking talk down to me like I'm some kind of idiot who needs to be
00:55:41 Yeah, you're sucking his pee all right
00:55:46 I'm invalid I'm invalid
00:55:51 I mean truth be told truth be told, um, maybe maybe uh
00:55:56 I really like I really like the flip the flip was like literally all the aesthetics over actual substance
00:56:02 You know, I think it wasn't much as much as could have happened in a finale like this
00:56:08 So my final score is 10 out of 10. I appear upfront and do a funny jump and I was really glad
00:56:14 Okay, okay, okay
00:56:16 Tom Tom for real for real. Whatever you
00:56:18 Think like
00:56:20 Shut the fuck up god everyone everybody back to joining
00:56:26 Why is this 45 person
00:56:28 like people talking
00:56:38 Most people aren't talking I that's
00:56:40 I expected this to be a complete cluster fucking now because I understand anyone at all
00:56:50 I
00:57:20 Everyone
00:57:42 All right, all right, that's enough that's that's enough of that
00:57:50 That
00:58:08 There would be like this is why I thought there would be mini podcasts by team
00:58:13 Yeah, well, that's what I was gonna. That's what I wanted to bring up. I was
00:58:16 And with all the ideas shut up
00:58:29 What I was going to what I was going to do was we were gonna
00:58:32 I was gonna have an initial section that was everyone
00:58:35 And and and I assumed it would just be complete chaos
00:58:38 And then at some point I would we would split into teams and then I would you would keep recording
00:58:43 You like like keep recording yourself even when I when like us we are not in there
00:58:48 Or I mean
00:58:50 We could yes
00:58:51 We could
00:58:52 We could split it me like ben takes one and top takes a team and tom takes a team and give
00:58:57 Or we could just the pcp members could just go like in cycle one to the other and I was thinking maybe
00:59:03 It's on gib we can go
00:59:08 Okay, okay, so so do we want to split up into teams?
00:59:13 That's great
00:59:16 You been this podcast
00:59:18 I do think it's a little too late for that. No
00:59:22 No, it's gonna make it way more complicated. There is no need for it. No
00:59:31 If we just like the conversation it might be possible with uh, with you long interruptions of streaming in between, you know, I mean, I think
00:59:40 You know, you know what?
00:59:43 We're gonna have a vote. We're gonna have a fucking vote. Yeah, we're gonna do it. We're gonna vote
00:59:48 How are you gonna do that?
00:59:50 I
01:00:11 Okay, yeah, yes already has a majority
01:00:14 Uh, yeah, but okay. Okay. Okay. Oh, yeah. All right. Fine. Yeah, bobe bobe posted it in the general chair
01:00:21 Okay, fine. Just yeah, just react to vote
01:00:24 What are we voting? What is yes on whether
01:00:28 We don't have whether whether we split into teams whether we say no, okay
01:00:33 I'm I feel like that could maybe be interesting. So okay. Yeah, because we have lull michelle
01:00:39 We have we have teams she will she it's too late. She's not joining
01:00:46 I'm
01:00:49 Get out
01:01:03 Okay, so it looks like all right
01:01:06 We don't have to split up right now, but at some point we I don't know. Should we should we should we split now?
01:01:15 Okay
01:01:17 Keep recording keep recording yourselves. Um, we're gonna make different videos and you can choose your own
01:01:22 My team or how we I have an idea. I'm gonna make the team chat to the team voice chat, right?
01:01:29 I yeah, I'm going to make them available right now and we are gonna fucking go and and do that
01:01:36 Starting with red team
01:01:41 Welcome to the progress seniors and only monsters show about pcp
01:01:52 But then they all play at the same exact time
01:01:55 Yes
01:01:57 Pan slightly
01:02:00 Isn't it we are give him a second. We are we are I need I need to fuck around with the channel
01:02:08 I'm not going to cut anything
01:02:11 Okay, you know what that's fair
01:02:13 Hey, ben
01:02:16 Yeah, what's up?
01:02:17 Okay, so you can make the channels so that everyone can listen but only the colored team can speak
01:02:27 And that way
01:02:33 This is new age reparations
01:02:37 That might be the worst idea I've heard on this poll point
01:02:43 Ben, I know how discord works. I run a discord make me a model make that happen
01:02:49 Ben, I know how discord works. I know how children would all be the best discord moderator ever
01:02:54 All right girl girl inside ben saint lemal. All right. How do I how do I do that? I think I will do that actually
01:02:59 Yeah, just just make an admin role and then give it to me
01:03:13 We're instating trans fascism now, um, you're all my slave
01:03:18 Do you do you all do you all see do you all see the the color?
01:03:24 Yeah, I don't see the color ben wait you can't join them
01:03:31 Okay, you should you should be able to I can't join purple for some reason I can't join pink
01:03:37 Yeah
01:03:48 Yeah, let's just do the podcast here like that's a trick
01:03:54 We're just gonna we're just gonna split up keep recording yourselves, you know
01:03:59 Red team is the best but there's like only
01:04:03 Guess it's not that great then, huh?
01:04:07 Okay, so Ben Ben. Oh my god, what do we just split into teams and each team will have like a long time
01:04:19 I think we're are you doing the rotate thing or the uh, whatever I think actually
01:04:24 You're fantastic purple gone. I still can't get into pink. I think they're still working on pink. All right
01:04:34 This episode it's so fun
01:04:38 Right. Yes, hard
01:04:41 Massachusetts. All right, right cool red team
01:04:45 Uh, uh, I
01:04:47 What's what's going on? I gotta get I gotta get tom and uh
01:04:50 I gotta get tom and gibbon here
01:04:52 Hello, this has been a terrible idea frankly. Yeah awful. Yeah, it'd be the worst idea you've ever had
01:05:00 Yeah, well, you know terrible ideas actually. No, I know everybody is uh being ironic about this being the worst idea
01:05:10 But I think it's the best idea and because everybody is here and is having fun
01:05:15 I think it's actually the best idea and I you know
01:05:19 The the point of it, you know, it's
01:05:21 It's about
01:05:22 It's not about having fun. It's about making the commenters mad
01:05:26 It's about it's about all the angry comments that are going to be under it
01:05:30 Like wow, the pcp's really gone downhill. Like wow, they're doing this now like cringe, you know, like wow unsubscribing
01:05:36 Nate's not on the podcast. No, Nate. No, listen. See you next week. Uh, yeah, I did yeah
01:05:41 You fucking comment every fucking week for like four weeks now. I've seen that same comment and you fucking weirdo
01:05:47 Uh, uh, uh, what's your what's your what's what's what's his problem?
01:05:51 You know, like what's his deal liking Nate on ironically
01:05:54 Sure, I mean and that's just the start. That's just the start of this problem
01:05:57 The worst thing about those those comments are like the
01:06:01 the sort of smug
01:06:03 Satisfaction that the sort of like self-assuredness that they are like destroying our psyche and that they are like really fucking cutting deep
01:06:11 and it's like
01:06:13 No, it's no we're just doing the podcast and other people aren't showing up
01:06:18 It's as simple as that
01:06:20 It does seem like the pcp has both an incredibly dedicated audience
01:06:23 Like, you know, I don't mean this offensively
01:06:25 But like you guys do get relatively low numbers and still you have really high engagement on like your uh, patreon and whatnot and at the same time
01:06:31 it seems like
01:06:32 Your audience completely hates like half like each member each audience member probably has like three or four
01:06:40 You know members of the podcast that they just hate and it's like a really weird dynamic
01:06:45 That's quite that's what happens when you have a cult following that attracts autists that have hyper focus and
01:06:52 It's just it's just the way there's there's some weird intangible thing that these people
01:06:58 Really find themselves interested in and when it's not there the entire facade falls apart and they're like wow, this is terrible
01:07:04 I guess we set ourselves up. Yeah, you know
01:07:08 We definitely had like like great moments in the past
01:07:11 I'm sure people are just remembering those but like
01:07:15 I don't know. I don't necessarily think that the future is always worse
01:07:20 Like they they don't like the dynamic anymore
01:07:23 When there's less people some people do prefer it. So it's just it's a different show
01:07:28 Yeah, it's they they want it to be
01:07:30 Like the yellow episode every episode
01:07:33 And that's just like it's kind of in his in history now. You can't recreate that
01:07:37 I think yeah, I think there's a lot of people there was a lot of people to whom the yellow episode is the ideal pcp episode
01:07:43 If every episode was the yellow episode the yellow episode would not be special or interesting
01:07:48 It would just be worse than the noise. It's true. That's true. If every pcp episode was good. We wouldn't have hot dogs
01:07:54 I was just thinking about that
01:07:56 How much I want a hot dog
01:07:58 Last night. I was really hungry
01:08:00 I was curious how thick you guys's skin is because like
01:08:03 I do do you guys
01:08:06 I mean, oh like metaphorically you talk about how the yellow episode is the best episode to me that episode is like
01:08:11 No, literally how many inches how many how how hard would it be to skin you?
01:08:16 Yeah, I can't put them to me the the yellow episode is
01:08:20 It's almost hard to listen to sometimes because it's just arguing it is just no
01:08:24 I agree the yellow the yellow episode was not fun to record
01:08:27 It was like actually really tense and unpleasant. Yeah, I don't like it much
01:08:32 It really needs to be stated that like
01:08:35 I think it's obvious if like you kind of understand that episode but like it started in the beginning
01:08:41 Already kind of in an awkward situation because the argument had been going on before the episode started
01:08:46 And I think most of us thought it was just gibbs and gaffes and jokes
01:08:50 But it quickly became apparent. No, this is real rage and the longer it went on the more is just like
01:08:55 Oh god
01:08:57 This is really happening. Yeah
01:08:59 Yeah, yeah for sure for sure. It was not a meme. It was that was a real
01:09:04 I think people still think that it was like a meme and it was not a meme. No, no
01:09:09 It literally wanted to murder us for like a year after that and he probably still does I'd argue
01:09:14 I actually had had a similar experience, you know, uh when I staffed at
01:09:21 brony fair in in germany in berlin one year, you know, and
01:09:27 Uh, I I stayed at some people some people's house
01:09:31 Uh, some people's flat, you know, and I I like
01:09:35 And after the con I like was packed and everything and uh, you know, just chilling and I just asked the guy
01:09:43 Oh, so
01:09:44 What did you think of of the convention? You know, how did you like it?
01:09:48 and he just started going off and he he like started
01:09:54 Telling like one thing that was wrong after another and you know and in my mind. I was like, uh at the start
01:10:01 I was just
01:10:02 Thinking of what I would reply, you know, but after like the five minutes. I was like, okay
01:10:09 Maybe he's not stopping then 10 minutes. I'm like, okay. Maybe this is not worth it
01:10:15 And then, you know, when it started to go over 20 minutes
01:10:19 I was just resigned to just listening and
01:10:23 and he
01:10:24 he like
01:10:26 Yeah, he like
01:10:27 Complaints about a con for like 40 minutes. It was unbelievable
01:10:33 Yeah, yeah, that well that was my first experience of something that extreme. Well personally speaking. I think the podcast
01:10:39 I mean, listen, it's not perfect right now. I do think you guys on the upwards trend
01:10:42 I I think some of those past episodes aren't good to be frank. I don't hold the yellow episode in that high regard
01:10:48 I think the podcast as it is right now is a lot better than the audience seems to give a credit for
01:10:52 I think you guys have an audience that is full of whiny bitches to be honest
01:10:55 I I want to
01:10:57 As much as their favorite member is in it. So if you don't yeah the podcast is garbage, right?
01:11:02 If if the way if the podcast lately isn't to your taste
01:11:05 I'm not gonna say like I disagree like that's wrong
01:11:08 But but I definitely agree that they are a bunch of whiny bitches
01:11:12 Well, that's that's been the case since episode one. So I'm yeah
01:11:15 Yeah
01:11:16 Um, okay, we've been I think we're gonna do like a little five minute
01:11:19 John's we've been in five minutes. So we're gonna move on a blue team, but we will be back
01:11:23 No, I wanted to ask about freely printing. We will we will be we will come next time next time
01:11:28 I will I will be
01:11:30 Happy to chat about that. Okay. Here we go. Um, all right. Peace out
01:11:36 Oh god, this is awkward. I better I better I better
01:11:40 They'll
01:11:42 Oh, shit. Okay, they're here
01:11:46 They're here get your guns out get your strengths. What do you think?
01:11:49 I want to I want to I want to I want to talk on behalf of my team
01:11:52 We we learned what we learned as a team blue team blue team, baby. Here we go
01:11:57 Okay, we learned we learned that the pope in one timeline
01:12:00 Learned the beauty of Undertale and became game developer and made Dark Souls 4
01:12:05 Uh, thanks for listening to our thesis. Thanks. Thanks Matt. There's a lot of indie titles on steam
01:12:11 Who's to say that the pope isn't publishing right now?
01:12:16 God
01:12:18 I'm just trying to imagine
01:12:20 The pope that was like like the fucking map pack gave the pope a just a steam code not even a physical
01:12:27 Uh, okay, you can fight you for this out, man. You're you're good. Do you think the pope is like right?
01:12:32 Is do you think the pope is supporting yandere dev?
01:12:35 Absolutely
01:12:41 God has spoken to him and he says yandere yes
01:12:45 Actually, did you guys hear?
01:12:47 No, no
01:12:48 It's still upon him the cum chalice
01:12:51 Did you guys hear about uh, lovesick or the
01:12:56 They destroyed yandere dev's game by making the game better in like
01:13:03 I did
01:13:05 I don't know how long
01:13:07 Yeah, we should give that to better like they used the same
01:13:12 Fucking free ass free public assets and they just made the same game except better in two weeks
01:13:17 And then they're just like yeah, you're a fucking idiot
01:13:20 That sucks so bad. Oh my god
01:13:22 He threatened to kill himself over the fact that this game was made like please don't do it or I might hurt myself
01:13:29 Why don't we just do why don't we just make that game like over the course of this podcast, you know
01:13:34 We have done right now
01:13:36 like yandere dead
01:13:39 We should make a game jam podcast
01:13:42 and just
01:13:44 Yandere simulator
01:13:46 You know, we just it should be a trend just yandere devs like like speedrun just making the game
01:13:53 Yandere but it's but it's ben talking about communism to every single member of the
01:13:59 I don't understand how those things are related at all
01:14:04 I mean communism
01:14:09 You purchase the game on steam and it's just a lecture saying how you're bad
01:14:17 No, god, there's no ethical consumption under capitalism and it's no one's fault that they're complicit. Oh my god. Okay
01:14:29 Ben just goes up to people, you know capitalism kind of weird
01:14:33 You know, uh, uh, I just uh, I mean, uh, uh, I don't want to talk about this change the subject, please
01:14:43 I want I want to be I want to attempt to be like the straight man. Uh, not the not the straight man. That's like in jokes
01:14:48 Amen
01:14:51 Actually
01:14:53 Something meaningful and not like every other. Yeah pretty cringe
01:14:57 But you know, you know, if you are enough cringe surrounded by other people are cringe
01:15:01 might be a little bit base
01:15:03 That's what I learned from the pc
01:15:06 That's what I learned when I played undertale with the pope
01:15:10 Yeah, see it seems to be noted. So, uh, uh, well, what what do you guys think about like this?
01:15:17 Like having your fans get inside the thing you are making your
01:15:22 Your fans getting inside
01:15:25 I think that it's a great I think that it's a great source of free labor for me to extract surplus value from
01:15:32 So you're saying you're not having the mobile move
01:15:37 We are we are not capitalists. We are slave owners right now. We're we're we're straight up feudal monarchs
01:15:45 Anymore permanent podcasts us
01:15:47 Extract those tives, you know
01:15:50 Feels good. This is this is this is it. It's time for you all to pay the piper. We've entertained you for years and now
01:15:55 We call upon you
01:15:58 Jesus Christ
01:15:59 We know it was then it would like jesus on the beach now you have to carry us. There's only one set of footprints
01:16:08 But it's actually like 40 sets because there's like 50 people in here. So, you know
01:16:12 Ben points at the crowd now it's your turn
01:16:15 Yeah, I totally was not just away from my computer just now guys. I was I'm
01:16:19 Completely in on this conversation
01:16:22 That sounds like a great time for us to move on to yellow team, but we'll be back
01:16:36 I can't do this
01:16:50 We're just waiting for ben. Why is he taking so long? Why does he take even one side?
01:16:59 How is it that ben is late even when
01:17:03 Yeah, like on the thing
01:17:06 I'm a fucking idiot
01:17:11 It takes me so fucking long just to move craig from one room to another
01:17:15 Ben you can and you can just click on craig and drag him to a different
01:17:22 If you're on death, you really want to realize that craig is not a person. That's epic. Wait, really? Yeah
01:17:29 I think that breaks them. I think that breaks it. Uh, I oh if it breaks it, fuck you
01:17:34 Okay, I don't want to I don't want to risk it. I don't want to I know it breaks music bots
01:17:38 That's all I know or you stew. Okay better better not to better not to chance it then
01:17:42 Um, but so how how's everyone doing over here in the yellow room?
01:17:47 We're doing good. We were we were positive talking the pcp and shit talking the purple team, you know
01:17:53 Exciting stuff. We were trying to work our own identity. Let's let's shit talk the purple team. Yeah. Yeah
01:18:03 Before we shit on the purple team, I want to take an extra moment to shed on ellie is our specifically
01:18:08 Who was by far the most disruptive person in the general chat?
01:18:12 You're supposed to be the fucking editor. He went he leaned way too into the meme
01:18:16 He expected it to be chaos. We wanted to play into that and it didn't work and he was not charming and I fucking hate him
01:18:22 and I guarantee
01:18:25 He's he's not he's not gonna use the audacity audio from fucking anyone because someone's gonna fucking
01:18:30 There's no point in all of us recording. He's going to use craig because he's a lazy piece of shit
01:18:33 There's no he's gonna sing all these different
01:18:36 Podcast I don't think ellie is lazy. I think I'll use it. I mean, I I don't know. I guess I'm okay. No
01:18:44 Your rent is like completely leaped out
01:18:47 Because I was in charge. Yeah
01:18:50 I know you're listening ellie is our fuck you guys
01:18:53 I have the power to erase you from existence
01:18:57 I don't want ellie is our to erase this group for
01:19:00 The coolest stalin picture
01:19:02 The person next to stalin it's just like rubbed out, you know
01:19:05 Yeah
01:19:08 He has a full nine inches. He's the best guitar player on earth
01:19:12 Uh, uh, yeah, he probably probably the most I haven't seen his face
01:19:16 But like you can tell he's incredibly handsome like at least
01:19:23 I wish that apple was me
01:19:25 I'm speaking possibly, uh, give stupid idiot corner a funny jingle a good part of the podcast
01:19:31 That's too, uh, you know, yeah
01:19:34 Yeah, yeah
01:19:35 Given I want to say thank you on stream for the flourisheship for randomly drawing a hoop snake
01:19:40 And then drawing it again once you realize that you do it wrong
01:19:43 Oh, yeah, yeah
01:19:46 Thank you for drawing a zucchini punk. Oh
01:19:49 Oh, yeah, zucchini punk. Oh
01:19:53 Guys, I think it's important to go back to what's important in life though, and that's shitting on the purple team. Yeah
01:20:00 I don't know a hundred percent agreed
01:20:04 Is
01:20:08 We are we are the color of the sun we bask in light
01:20:11 Uh, every purple team is like that's just following the crowd pink is like, oh three people
01:20:17 I just want I'm not like the other girls
01:20:19 All right, my my experience with the other team is red red is pretty chill
01:20:23 Blue is kind of is kind of rambunctious yellow is like caddy and like mean
01:20:28 Good
01:20:33 Ben, you know, I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna overcome the reputation by saying, you know
01:20:37 Slime and punishment of base a winning 5-0
01:20:41 Talking about rck and pcb is always good by the way. Um, I mean I appreciate that
01:20:46 You know, I don't ironically
01:20:48 I don't ironically been I've actually been rewatching, uh, the nuzlocs. I'm they're really good
01:20:53 I really hope you do one again someday every every once in a while
01:20:56 Someone someone like messages me on twitter or on or I get a message on a youtube videos the nuzloc videos
01:21:02 It's like yeah rewatching these again like, you know, I come back to these every once in a while and I'm like, ah
01:21:07 Man, I love I love I love I love that people do that. Yeah, okay
01:21:11 Speaking of teams having
01:21:15 This is a call out post to everyone. I don't have a middle of ground. I'm so sorry. No, this is much better. This is much better
01:21:22 Yeah, okay. This is this is a call
01:21:26 Oh my god
01:21:28 Say his thing
01:21:30 Okay, so yeah, so I realized something so we know that now
01:21:33 Diginee has changed her channel to diginee and digibro
01:21:37 So with what said I have realized that technically digibro aka may has been grandfathered in the procrastinator's podcast
01:21:43 So therefore I was wondering
01:21:45 Ben could you theoretically change your name to ben saint and the entirety of antifa and therefore make all of antifa
01:21:51 a member of the procrastinator
01:21:54 um
01:21:55 Mom could also add a zoomie or whatever and give him a handle of the characters
01:22:00 You've explained it so clearly that I you've answered your own question. Obviously. Yes, I can do that
01:22:06 That's that's well within every every uh member like all of all of the signed up members of antifa
01:22:14 All the members of the antifa organization are about to
01:22:18 I've seen I've seen like fake sign-up forms going around and I'm pretty sure it's like
01:22:23 It's like right wingers like sending them around to get people to sign up
01:22:26 I'd like to get their identity and like harass them or something to put them on
01:22:30 I know this one. There was there was this website that was like join antifa dot com and somebody just
01:22:36 Somebody just looked in the like in the like data of the website and it was Ben Shapiro's
01:22:42 Uh email
01:22:43 It was made by it was made by a left-wing person and it was just a joke. It was an easter egg
01:22:49 Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It was it was funny. It does exist. It was really funny. Yeah
01:22:54 It was funny
01:22:55 uh
01:22:56 It was deliberately funny, but it's still funny. Yeah, okay
01:23:01 A sign what were you saying before I started to cut you off
01:23:04 Yeah, I feel like an idiot for speaking over death alchemist, but I'm I guess I'll say it anyway
01:23:09 I have the spotlight now. This is this is a call-out post because uh to anyone who listens to this bullshit
01:23:16 Right now. Oh, yeah
01:23:18 We we have we have we have teams. They have personalities. We need fan art. I want fan art
01:23:24 Of the teams. Yeah, you're listening right now. Make the fucking fan art or I will kill you. This is me being catty
01:23:32 Maybe a team or the catty team. So we need to all be cat
01:23:35 Maybe I maybe I can get maybe I can get married
01:23:37 Yeah, we need to like hire someone to draw like red team chan and like blue team
01:23:43 Yeah
01:23:46 Well-rounded rich characters
01:23:48 We need to be like the short spiky haired yellow haired girl with like the two little like spiky tooth
01:23:54 The that's like max from Beyblade. That's that's well, that was I won't talk about rad con
01:23:59 But that reminds me of something from rad con that is a still a secret. Hey, we got to get moving. We got to move
01:24:03 Wait, I have one final PSA. I have one last thing to say
01:24:07 Uh
01:24:08 PCP terrible for your health. You're the reason people are dying one hurry. Hunna speedrun
01:24:14 You should not be conditioning for less than three minutes
01:24:17 Your hair will get dry and you will be a bad person
01:24:20 So three minutes is the absolute absolute minimum for the speedrun and two keto diet is shit
01:24:25 I did it lost 15 pounds gained it all back. I did a real diet and I lost 50 pounds
01:24:30 Uh keto is bad
01:24:32 Um
01:24:34 Stupid
01:24:50 Uh now now 10 years of been trying to move craig
01:25:02 Oh
01:25:06 Why are tech god, they're right endless war is impossible to play text commands are so difficult
01:25:13 Okay, hello, we're we're here we're here green team. How's it how's it how's it hang it's going good
01:25:20 Energy is nice and calm. It's it's it's a good feeling
01:25:23 My regret is that my name starts with t and my team was green. So in both cases
01:25:29 I'm like three quarters of the way down the list
01:25:32 Uh
01:25:34 Oh, I thought you were gonna say it was like a pun like green tea. I thought that's where you're going with that
01:25:39 That would have been that would have been way more more coherent
01:25:42 They're thinking that we have a sense of humor
01:25:47 What do we think guys
01:25:50 Who's the worst team? Who's the worst team?
01:25:52 There are no worse team. We're all the same. We just split off from like a main team. We're the same team
01:25:57 That's that's too. That's a little too
01:26:00 That's a little too reasonable
01:26:02 This is the reasonable group. We figured it. We found them. This is the reasonable people the neutral party red was pretty reasonable
01:26:08 I'm forced to pick one. I'm going to pick purple just because of the the total number of people who are
01:26:15 shit posters without substance
01:26:19 That man has good content. I don't know fat man has pretty solid content. Yeah, but we're not counting good things
01:26:25 We're counting bad things
01:26:27 We're gonna be counting all day bad things
01:26:31 um
01:26:32 guys
01:26:34 You uh, you how about how about how about how I murdered munchie and slime fast pretty funny, right?
01:26:40 Pretty cool. Yeah, I lost all my slimes. I've been playing much, but uh, you know, that's
01:26:48 Uh, munchie lost all his too. So fuck him, you know, you know, he's that's that buster. He got busted
01:26:55 Bro, I didn't even get killed. I just it was just like nope level one again
01:26:59 Oh, you you fell victim to um, what do you call it a slime decay?
01:27:04 That must be it, right?
01:27:06 Just like I think it was after an update. I think it just happened right after an update
01:27:10 Oh, maybe that was during the dream arc when everything everyone was asleep and it was all a dream
01:27:16 Oh, okay. Yeah, that makes sense. Also, I'm a little concerned because I'm hearing thunder out my window
01:27:20 And if my power goes out, I will perish. No, same
01:27:23 I'm about I'm in middle sex county right now. So like, uh, it's not not it's not that bad
01:27:29 It's not that bad
01:27:30 What you need is an uninterruptible power supply. So it gives you like a five minute buffer for you to save and shut everything down
01:27:39 Uh, what is that? Is that like a generator or is that real? It's it's like a it's like a power strip
01:27:46 But like big kind of running and it's got a small battery in it
01:27:51 That battery backup power
01:27:53 Well, that battery continues or running after the power goes off up to a certain limit and then like
01:27:58 Shut down or yes, that's exactly that's that's good. That means you can save your work
01:28:04 That's always the worst thing. Yep
01:28:07 I haven't had a power outage in like
01:28:09 A number of years
01:28:12 I'm jelly. We have power out. Okay. So guys, should I talk about shit core right now?
01:28:18 Well, before you get into this, I want to
01:28:23 I want to fulfill the prophecy
01:28:25 Hey, Tom. Okay. Yo, what's up?
01:28:27 So you probably will only remember this about halfway through me explaining it, but okay. Um
01:28:36 Millions of years ago when the world was new and you made videos about my little pony
01:28:41 I hate you up
01:28:43 Uh to ask if you wanted a custom belt
01:28:46 Yeah
01:28:48 Yeah
01:28:51 Literally in my field of vision right now
01:28:54 Right belt saga actually began with tom
01:28:58 I see
01:29:00 Yeah, everyone it seemed like when we got to brony con it seemed like everyone knew you and like you were the belka
01:29:06 And like I had never heard of you before and I was like, what is what is this? What is what was it?
01:29:10 Was it I think it was you found nate first or something and and natin happened to need a belt and then that was very
01:29:18 Amusing that you were a belt guy. Yeah, and then I
01:29:21 Spotted into something amazing like that. That's so fucking sick
01:29:25 Yeah, I and I saw you and I saw you making the belt live the belt has your belt skill improved
01:29:31 Substantially since that long distant past. Well when I set you that belt I had
01:29:38 Six patterns that I could weave and now I have 42 and all the rest of them are my own invention
01:29:44 That's pretty intense
01:29:47 Yeah, I think I like send you a high resolution photo of this belt
01:29:50 So you can do one of those memes on twitter where it's like 2013 versus 2020 and uh blow people's minds
01:29:58 Yeah, yeah, do you think you could like make a cape out of that?
01:30:04 Like a belt that just keeps on going
01:30:06 I could it could be done
01:30:08 It could be done. It would be a little unwieldy to wear because nylon is very heavy
01:30:16 Maybe a like a flower buds get or something. Hmm. I think you could make like a pleated kilt or something like that
01:30:22 That's a little more doable
01:30:24 But I mean to anybody who was there on the day, you know what the process looks like
01:30:30 That is and to get more width. I need more fingers
01:30:33 Which I uh, I'm currently at my at the limit of my finger subscription
01:30:38 This is as high as the uh as the subscription tier goes
01:30:43 And I hope I don't miss a payment. Otherwise, I'll just be like down half of my usable usable digits
01:30:49 Do we we gotta we gotta move on to purple team? Is there anything any any last minute last minute things?
01:30:54 Hey, what the fuck? I never got to talk about shit core. I didn't mean oh, you're right
01:30:59 Uh, you yeah, what's about what about shit core?
01:31:03 Okay, so do you do y'all know about shit core?
01:31:07 No, don't know. No. Okay. So shit core is a genre of music
01:31:12 Except it's not really a genre because you can play any genre you want. It's just about making the music bad
01:31:20 And so how I found out about this is from absolute trash media
01:31:26 Jesus, I found I found out about this from miss sarah louise
01:31:32 Uh, in other words blind sky watcher who is the musician who created a lot of the instrumentals for digi
01:31:40 nay digi nays
01:31:44 What's it called?
01:31:45 Go trial of the golden witch. Yes those albums. Yeah
01:31:51 and so
01:31:52 Okay
01:31:53 So there are a lot of albums on this label absolute trash media
01:32:02 Uh, in uh, in fact, you can just scroll for ages and never get to the bottom
01:32:09 Because more and more people just joining and create albums for this shit wait
01:32:16 And this is this third generation of this
01:32:19 Because the first generation you can't even write you you can't even reach that on the internet because that has been deleted
01:32:26 But the second generation vortex of crap dot bandcamp dot com
01:32:32 But there was a previous vortex of crap which contained like a hundred albums and that's just deleted
01:32:41 so
01:32:43 We got
01:32:45 Anyway
01:32:47 What's what's what's the what's the pitch like how does it sound like? Well, how would you describe it?
01:32:53 um
01:32:55 It sounds like a quality genre rather than just like blowing out your speakers with like
01:33:00 Times the amount of gain is actually kind of nice. It's weird. Okay, so you you can make that
01:33:06 um, that is actually
01:33:09 A lot of the albums are just like that
01:33:12 That ties the genre together than in a than like a sound is that kind of like the idea
01:33:18 How they would describe it on their discord channel it's just that they make music in order to make each other laugh
01:33:26 Okay, so it can make
01:33:30 Yeah
01:33:37 Okay, okay
01:33:38 Sorry, I'm sorry, but we've been here for too long. We gotta keep moving. We will be back
01:33:42 We will be back
01:33:44 Okay, we are going we're going to purple. We will be back in a little bit when we make our way around again
01:33:50 Oh multiple laps cool. We're making we're doing multiple laps. Yes, uh
01:33:56 Trying to keep the pace up. We'll be a group sinks in case we need to leave or at the end. We will probably all
01:34:02 um join up again
01:34:04 Uh, yes, uh, okay
01:34:06 Uh be be back be bex bebex soon
01:34:12 Shut up. I'm gonna shut up
01:34:14 One of the best is not a mess with a guest the the pcp the only three members
01:34:30 I'm like
01:34:33 Pre-edited
01:34:37 Crazy lightning hitting outside my house and I'm like yikes. I'm like I could be I could power at any minute honestly

01:37:39 That is true
01:37:40 Beatable. We are the cute and the funniest
01:37:47 We're the biggest
01:37:50 Are we doing voicemails? Is that happening?
01:37:54 We're floundering
01:37:59 Ben load them up
01:38:04 Yeah, absolutely. Okay. No no problem. I got one for I got one hot and fresh out of the oven for you
01:38:19 No, this will be the first one, but
01:38:21 Okay
01:38:24 We are all gay
01:38:27 And I'm posting it in the in the purples in the purples chat
01:38:30 You can just scream it, you know
01:38:40 We are listening to it right now, I think a lot of people in this world are by and just don't know it
01:38:48 They are able to get by by being straight and they don't even consider the alternative
01:38:56 So
01:38:58 Just go out
01:39:00 eat a pussy
01:39:07 Being straight is a gateway sexuality to being by I never thought about it like that
01:39:15 You should wait wait what I mean. Yes, but why I think he's he's just right
01:39:21 What
01:39:25 Not not to be that guy, but I think conventional like sexuality is literally just a myth propped up by christian and
01:39:43 Yeah, he's clearly just on the recruit
01:39:45 We're all on the spectrum, right? We're all on the fucking kinsie scale
01:39:50 This is true
01:39:56 Hold on hold on hold on that is true
01:39:58 Sam, will you get a voicemail like this? You need to preface it by saying this is liberal propaganda for the all that
01:40:06 That would be fair. I can't do it
01:40:09 I
01:40:16 Had a very serious question about your slime and punishment
01:40:20 Yes, very good. Was there any uh inspiration drawn from the world plates and that um, what is that?
01:40:28 Yeah, no good quit. No, not really. It's actually based on um, because in episode 15 and 16 of sonichu
01:40:37 Magi-chan they go to the time point and magi-chan creates a ball and sonichu runs in the ball
01:40:42 And it rolls like a hamster wheel and that's what moves it forward and back up your time
01:40:45 Yeah, that's how they use the time orb to yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so the idea of it rolling
01:40:51 That the other day in preparation for slime punishment and 102 and I am mix. I'm on the edge of my fucking seat waiting for it
01:40:57 Can we get done a good job for what?
01:41:01 for the lecture
01:41:03 Oh, probably not more than a few weeks. I think awesome. Awesome. Yeah pretty pretty spaced
01:41:12 Can I just say you're an absolute chad for like low key dissing digi and they in the fucking
01:41:19 Message you sent them you are a chiro. You're a champion and I mean, I mean, I just don't understand
01:41:24 I don't understand people that just
01:41:28 A little bit of
01:41:33 More a little bit
01:41:49 Consistent
01:41:51 We got a we got a we got a we got to move on to pink team any last
01:42:02 Okay, can I just say one thing? We're sorry
01:42:08 Give you are cool and I love you and I like you but please for the next lecture explain what you're talking about
01:42:21 It's riska that that's that's the best thing around you don't need to know nothing except that riska is base
01:42:28 When will you be in the green ranger? When are you going to do a green ranger cosplay?
01:42:31 When I've always thought that if I ever got to like $2,000 on patreon
01:42:35 I would spend all the money on getting a complete accurate green ranger outfit. You know what to do everybody
01:42:40 patreon.com slash tomyoliver
01:42:42 Literally since 2012 that's always been like a
01:42:51 Is a goal
01:43:13 Our guests have left us
01:43:21 We're back in the
01:43:28 Okay, I'm getting I'm getting faster at this I'm getting faster at this whole
01:43:33 Hello, what's up?
01:43:36 We've you're you're the you're the last boys
01:43:39 Yeah
01:43:41 We have sampled we have sampled every team thus far and gotten a taste of their unique culture
01:43:47 Uh-huh, and we're gonna do the same to you whether you like it or not. What's what's going on?
01:43:51 What's going on over here in the in the pink team?
01:43:55 I'm talking
01:43:57 Sorry about stuff
01:44:00 Like half the people who are supposed to show up
01:44:02 So it's just been a real quiet quiet. Yeah, we thought we were like more than double our size
01:44:07 But we're just three lone souls
01:44:10 Three lone creatives. Yeah
01:44:13 That's uh, that's that's how it be. I I expected a lot of people
01:44:17 That like got verified wouldn't actually show up. That's just how these things go. Yeah, I mean we're lucky
01:44:24 Yeah, yeah
01:44:26 So what's what's the worst team?
01:44:29 purple
01:44:30 Okay, everyone has said purple
01:44:35 In this time we've decided to start beef with the pro and on cast so yeah
01:44:39 Good has been declared
01:44:41 Even even the even the humble green team the the green team is very like
01:44:46 It's pretty serious. It's pretty like it's not not overly concerned with uh with sentiment
01:44:50 It's just kind of like well here we are and we're gonna do or go through the craftsmen
01:44:55 They're craftsmen over there. What about the red team? Like is it awkward for just two people there?
01:45:00 They seem fine. Maybe when we get back there at all more than two people when we
01:45:04 No, that there was only two and then the three of us made five
01:45:08 I think yeah, I think it was just it was just the two of them. It's just two people
01:45:12 um
01:45:14 Even even the even the humble green team was like, eh, I guess purple team is probably the worst so
01:45:22 No, we hate the purple team with the with the passion. That's great. I love that
01:45:28 That's those are the two team personality traits hating the purple team and chilling our art
01:45:33 Yeah, yeah, shilling is good. I like already made a group
01:45:38 Really never we've shared our art shamelessly
01:45:42 I never paint. I I saw your film the other day. I liked it. It was very good. Thank you film
01:45:48 Wait, you really? Yeah, it's a short short anime. It's an animated short. It's like six minutes or something
01:45:54 It's it's two minutes. It was it was it felt like longer than two
01:45:59 Link in the description. Oh, yeah, put that in the description. You're on a speed more work. I'm gonna get to work
01:46:05 Um, yeah, no, that was that was very nice to work on. It's my first
01:46:12 Thingy that I did like everyone always talks about how animation is that big scary thing
01:46:17 That's so much work, but they never talk about that. It's also fun and rewarding and cool
01:46:23 But you like draw something and then it moves
01:46:25 It's like you're done, but the process leading up to being done is a painful nightmare
01:46:30 I think the love of the time it's it's because people have
01:46:33 Lofty ambitions of making an entire show or an entire like movie feature film like a gibby
01:46:40 And like making a an animated short is like relatively doable. You just need a couple months
01:46:46 Um, depending on the size and you can make a little thing and it'll it'll be great. It's fun
01:46:51 Only took like three weeks for this one. It was a school project
01:46:56 It's always nice when you can do school projects, but also do your own thing because the topics are loose. Oh, yeah, totally
01:47:03 Yeah, because I um, I am on like the school news
01:47:07 We're at where I'm at and I've been able to make a couple just really stupid projects and just have that
01:47:14 Also in the school news
01:47:16 Yeah, holy shit
01:47:18 I'm a real
01:47:21 Schools have news
01:47:24 Do you report on?
01:47:27 On campus this week
01:47:29 How many wedgies were there do you have murder mysteries at your school infinite wedgies?
01:47:36 What kind of school do you go to where there's murder mysteries?
01:47:39 Yeah, it's just that cool. You know, we kill people criminal justice school, you know, they gotta gotta keep them on their toes
01:47:45 The school newspaper has to murder people themselves
01:47:49 I get you gotta learn by doing
01:47:51 Yeah
01:47:52 Also, ben, I just want to say I am the sociopath who started the uh started the uh canonized ben as a saint petition
01:48:00 Oh
01:48:02 What's what's your name on twitter?
01:48:04 I think it's it's like will turn turn because that's my real name and then like some numbers
01:48:10 But squilliam fancy son. I think is the name. Yes squilliam fancy son. Okay
01:48:16 That that was like my that's like my artist's name that I chose a long time ago and I've regretted ever since
01:48:22 Yeah, seems seems good choice to me
01:48:25 Uh, uh, I should I should retweet that more often and be like, hey guys, we still and we've only we still have not gotten 100 signatures
01:48:33 What the fuck? Why are we slacking? Hope frances has not canonized you yet
01:48:39 Does he have the power to do that?
01:48:41 I mean, yes, I think so. I guess if anyone does it would probably be him
01:48:47 So, okay
01:48:49 And we should just get him we should just talk to him about undertale. He look we know he loves undertale
01:48:55 And that's another one. We should bond. We should just bond with him over that
01:48:59 Do you think we can get him in call right now? Does anyone need to have his discord?
01:49:03 I would say timezones, you know timezones. Oh, yeah
01:49:06 It many times on nine. I'm in the same time zone
01:49:12 Yeah, yeah, it's my neighbor. Are you in italy? No, I'm in germany
01:49:18 Okay
01:49:20 Yeah
01:49:22 Both uh, horde your roman empire. So it's fine
01:49:26 Uh, do you guys want to hear a voicemail?
01:49:30 Yeah
01:49:31 Let's let's do a voicemail while while we're here. Okay. I'm gonna post it. I'm gonna post it in the pink chat. This one is called
01:49:39 Want to do bitcoins?
01:49:42 Oh, no
01:49:43 Here we go. We're gonna we're gonna let's give that a listen on
01:49:48 Three two one play. Hey guys, it's me david here. I was watching my favorite youtube channel
01:49:56 Jake paul the other day and I realized, you know, jake paul is rich
01:50:02 And I I want to be rich
01:50:04 So I was looking into developing my own own bitcoin
01:50:09 And I asked my mommy about it and she told me I was too young to do that
01:50:14 So what I wanted to know is if you guys were interested
01:50:18 In DMing me to launch our bitcoin up off the ground
01:50:21 So we can become like jake paul one of the 1% and so ben can shed a tear because he's a socialist cry, baby
01:50:31 I
01:50:35 Could I just say I really feel the power trip for making shitty voicemails to listening to them? Yeah, right?
01:50:41 It's a whole different world over here
01:50:43 On this on this side of the equation
01:50:47 I think we had pc pennies and like as a potential concept
01:50:52 Yeah, but but nobody wanted to actually figure it out on the records and it's it's you know
01:50:57 It's a lot of work if somebody made real pc penny crypto
01:51:01 That would be the most amazing thing and I'm sure that it would go to the moon. It would put ripple xrp to shame
01:51:07 I will say
01:51:11 Because I never too young to bitcoin. They were talking about being too young
01:51:16 Bullshit, you can be six years old and make a coin and we're like go
01:51:20 There's like a whole video about like some really young kid or like did a startup to get like a coin thing going
01:51:25 He's going to conventions and stuff for crypto. This is real. You could do it
01:51:29 This guy's just using his mom as an excuse. You think real self starters don't listen to their parents
01:51:34 Fucking idiot have to be a true and cap and just sell your body for some bitcoin
01:51:39 I don't I don't even think this mom who doesn't think who thinks he's too young to make his own bitcoin is real
01:51:44 I think that's just like the personification of his internalized self-doubt or whatever
01:51:48 Agreed. Oh, I think you completely hard agree. There is no mom in quotes. You know what I'm saying
01:51:55 I
01:51:58 Okay, I think we got to move back to red. So we're gonna be we're gonna be
01:52:03 How often do you switch every I try to keep it to five minutes, but I usually go a little bit over
01:52:08 I've been going over a little bit. So five to ten minutes per per so we will be
01:52:12 How much longer is this going to go just wondering because I'm dying
01:52:16 Uh, I would say I'm gonna try and get it to be like maybe in probably less than another hour
01:52:21 Maybe down to half an hour one more rotation. If we do one more rotation, there'll be 30 minutes. I think we can do
01:52:29 Okay, let's let's let's try to do a reland after another rotation. Yeah, let's do another rotation
01:52:34 And maybe we'll do two more, but we'll see it. We'll see how long it takes. Okay. We are out
01:52:39 What what pink team out you guys doing another full round through all the parties? I think that's the plan
01:52:45 At least one more
01:52:48 Uh
01:52:49 We're really all right putting in the effort this week. What can I say? I wanted to ask a question real quick
01:52:54 I guess specifically towards gib, but have you considered doing like
01:52:59 Approaching like a publisher for your comics at all because I was we I was just talking uh with ilazon about
01:53:05 Uh, some comics he was reading some web comics and some that I were reading and it seemed like you could probably bring yours to something
01:53:11 Like I don't know like hive works or something
01:53:13 Hive works. Um, um, yeah
01:53:16 I've not thought of uh, I've not thought of anything like that. Um,
01:53:21 I don't know why I I guess it's it's obviously like a
01:53:24 possible
01:53:26 If it looks good enough. Okay. Okay. I applied to hive works one time
01:53:30 They they used to do like calls for submissions and I applied and during a call for submissions and I did not get accepted
01:53:37 Like very shortly after that they went like they changed their models
01:53:41 So they don't do calls for submissions. They just like anytime you can like email them and pitch them
01:53:47 Yeah, I think it's open all the time now. I I'm actually pretty good at their pitch right now that I'm trying to submit to them
01:53:51 I was I didn't realize you had submitted them. Did or did you say you actually did Ben? I did. Yeah, I did
01:53:58 And what probably would have been a like pitch look like
01:54:01 um
01:54:02 Well, they have like a an information like page that's like explains how to structure a pitch
01:54:08 You know, I had like like character like character art and like, um
01:54:15 Like a few a few pages of your of your it's just that's it just like a couple pages of your comics
01:54:20 so they can see what your art looks like and
01:54:23 Are you like text like one page or less like sort of text?
01:54:27 just explanation of what it is and like character uh, uh art
01:54:32 design whatever of an individual main characters
01:54:36 And that's it. Um, yeah
01:54:39 The one thing that sort of seemed weird to me about high works and this is I guess coming from a perspective of someone who doesn't
01:54:44 I guess the the amount of web comics I've read is fairly limited
01:54:48 I was talking to illison about this gaia web comic which I saw
01:54:52 Updated a page every couple of days. So we're talking like maybe two or three a week at most
01:54:56 How does yeah, how how do you even amass readers in such a way?
01:55:01 Like I don't how does how does someone decide to jump on a story that they know is going to be updated at such a slow pace
01:55:08 And it seems I mean it seems like that's like a pretty reasonable
01:55:11 That's like a pretty moderate pace for the for a web comic if you're uploading more than one page a week
01:55:16 You're like ahead of the pack
01:55:18 Yeah, I don't feel like that I don't like for a web comic. I don't feel like that's that slow
01:55:23 I think updates like the web comic format does work better for strips because you can jump in and jump out without having too much context
01:55:30 I think that's a why like four panel comics and stuff do so well. They're just so much more approachable
01:55:35 Strips are bad because
01:55:37 There's just too much of them and I'm going through the whole archive
01:55:41 But there's but like the biggest ones are those because like if you get a formula that works
01:55:46 Like they're so easily shareable. They're easily memeable
01:55:50 I saw um this this one that's like been recently getting big the the like great aliens that just say normal things but with like
01:56:00 Um, like a lot of words. I can't remember what it's called. That's not you on a web comic
01:56:05 It's just something that pops up on my facebook
01:56:08 Well, it is on the web. So I think it's on the web and it's a comic
01:56:12 I guess it's not a healthy comparison
01:56:14 But you think of like the stories that I guess most people would be used to is like manga and even beyond that
01:56:21 Obviously manga produces at a rate that no human should really strive for but even if you look at something like, you know, western
01:56:27 You know big two comics dc marvel. They're they're coming out like every month and to me that seems so
01:56:33 incredibly fast
01:56:35 compared to
01:56:36 the web comics
01:56:37 So I I guess to me it seems sort of like I don't understand how this works and yet it does seem to be working
01:56:43 And I I don't know just seems weird like imagine having to read one piece one page a week
01:56:48 And you get 50 pages a year. That's like that that is such a dwarf story at that point. You know what I mean
01:56:54 I mean, that's huge. That's kind of why I don't read a lot of story based web comics just because that drags so long
01:56:59 I'd rather just like read them in chunks of like a completed
01:57:02 Issue. Yeah
01:57:03 Imagine trying to read like scott pilgrim a page every week
01:57:09 It's kind of why stop. Oh god. That would suck. It would be terrible
01:57:13 But what you do is just have a larger number of them have them into ours as reader
01:57:20 And look look at it every day and every day you have different comics
01:57:26 That you read a page of work and like that's why they exist
01:57:29 It just like aggregates all the web comics because that's like the was the problem
01:57:33 Especially for me is like there'd be comics. I'd be reading like lc. Hooper and shit
01:57:36 I have to go back to the website
01:57:38 I'd always just forget about it
01:57:39 But then I'd have like a back luck to go through when I finally remembered six months from then
01:57:43 But it's not really good for audience retention
01:57:45 So I don't know it's not a great it's not a great format like story based stuff updating one page a week
01:57:50 It's just not ideal which is why nobody in like a professional capacity publishes that way
01:57:55 Yeah, just I guess it just only it seems like the only option
01:57:59 For someone who does not have the funding to gather a whole team
01:58:03 Like if you are just an artist maybe an artist and a writer you're not
01:58:07 You don't you just don't have the resources to have those six assistants that are necessary to be producing an issue
01:58:14 Right and you're also if you're starting out you don't this is probably not the way you're making money
01:58:18 So you also have to like work your day job and all that other shit
01:58:21 And so like it's just like a lot to ask of somebody in their free time to produce 24 pages in one month
01:58:28 I think what we're learning here is that comics is an inherently classic system that needs to be abolished at all costs
01:58:34 What else is new?
01:58:37 All you got to do is just be worse at art and you can make 50 pages in a month like me
01:58:41 That's how I made slime and punishment. You got to streamline some shit. You got to you got to make your choices. Everything's a compromise
01:58:48 Do you feel like slime and punishment is going going to affect the way you approach something like the vapors moving forward?
01:58:53 Are you going to simplify?
01:58:55 future
01:58:59 Maybe in places
01:59:00 Maybe in places. I think it was it slime and punishment was good practice for drawing efficiently and not like
01:59:08 Worrying about like small details where they aren't necessary
01:59:12 So yeah, I think in a way probably I will
01:59:15 be less inclined to like
01:59:17 Fucking spend an entire day like drawing and redrawing some like irrelevant thing
01:59:22 Which is something I was prone to do before which I'm sure I still will but maybe a little less. So that's cool
01:59:28 Hey, do you guys want to do do you guys want to hear a voicemail? Do you need to listen to a voicemail?
01:59:32 It's a goddamn voicemail. Yes. Um, okay. How about um, how about this one?
01:59:37 It is called metaphysics of frogs and I'm putting it in the reds only chat
01:59:43 All right. Okay. Uh, we're gonna listen to it on the count of three one two three play
01:59:52 Ben this one is for you buddy because something my brain just snapped
01:59:56 A few years ago. I was in a big uh, Jordan Peterson kick. Yeah, I grew out of it before becoming a far-right activist
02:00:03 Our fridge what really matters is that they get the the cookie omen to make a video
02:00:10 on the metaphysics of frogs because
02:00:14 He kind of sounds like kermit and cause pepper the frog and shit like that
02:00:19 So, um your character on the dnd is like a frog jesus in this interesting because frogs
02:00:27 They are amphibian. So they translate between the the water world and the earth world
02:00:35 and
02:00:36 this
02:00:38 mirrors the descent of the
02:00:42 Hero the hero's journey to the underworld to get the something that is most valid
02:00:47 Like in the tale of the princess and the frog when the frog descends to get the princess golden ball
02:00:55 um
02:00:55 It like in the bible when jesus he descends. Oh my god. How much longer is resurrected five second deeming humanity
02:01:04 That was very um Peterson core. Yeah of like loosely
02:01:09 The frog truly represents the mediation between the dragon of chaos and and the upper world of the of the goddess
02:01:16 Any frog start black and then turn green. So there's a clear
02:01:26 I mean, okay, well, I guess on the metaphysics of frogs. I agree
02:01:33 I agree with you about it. I'm with him and fuck Jordan Peterson. Yeah. Oh, no, no
02:01:39 Jordan Peterson is a funny meme man who eats nothing with beef. I hope I hope he's doing okay
02:01:45 He's he's going through a rough human level. I hope he's not literally dead. That is ideal. Oh, yeah
02:01:51 He seems like he's had like last I heard he had like brain damage
02:01:54 He was in russia recovering from like some medical bullshit. The winter soldier program
02:01:58 He was like they like induced a coma in it. Yeah, what there's so many based things about Peterson, you know
02:02:06 Like
02:02:08 He's like a cautionary tale of like what happens if like you blow up on the internet and are not ready for it
02:02:13 Like I just oh god. I don't I mean
02:02:15 I mean, he was ready for it and he was he he did he did pretty great
02:02:21 For
02:02:23 I'm like addicted to painkillers like that was like his wife got cancer
02:02:28 It was like the same time. So like he might have this might have been something that would have happened regardless
02:02:33 That's fair. Has anyone checked up on Nate to make sure he's not going down this path. Is he in russia right now?
02:02:38 We can we can only hope
02:02:41 Well, I hope for his sake that he's eating nothing but beef. That's the one thing I agree with
02:02:45 Okay, nothing to hurry. We are we are going to move on to blue. Wait, wait, what about what did you print last time?
02:02:53 What did I print?
02:02:55 Oh, okay, I've been 3d printing a bunch of stuff
02:02:59 Uh, I can't talk about some of it because it'd be spoiling other content. I'm working on but
02:03:04 I got some some some dnd minis. I printed some benches. I've been dialing in the settings on the anycubic i3 mega
02:03:11 I got it pretty nice now
02:03:12 I was having a lot of problems with bed adhesion and I realized it's because even though I had uh,
02:03:17 I had zhop enabled there was another setting that was overriding the zhop
02:03:21 So the nozzle kept clipping the supports and knocking it off the base and I thought it was
02:03:25 Problem with me leveling the bed, but it wasn't so I fixed that it's working good now
02:03:29 Uh, I just ordered replacement nozzles because the nozzle's like leaking shit. It's gross
02:03:33 It's probably all clogged up. So I'm gonna clean out the hot end and did you order different sizes?
02:03:38 Uh, yeah, I got 0.2 nozzle now. I'm gonna go even tinier details. It's gonna be sick
02:03:42 Also, I'm heavily considering getting an elegoomars pro. I really want to go resin. It's fucking cool
02:03:47 That's where yeah, none of those words were real
02:03:51 None of that was
02:03:53 Being encoded. Yeah
02:03:55 This is star trek technobabble from my
02:03:59 Just wait till he prints prints you an actual doll of of your character and you you'll start seeing it
02:04:07 Fucking cool. You can just do that
02:04:10 Okay, but we we must we must away. I think probably we're we're gonna make one more down
02:04:16 And then we will let you know we're gonna everyone will rejoin the general at the end
02:04:19 So I just wait wait for that. Okay. All right. He really is the best guy. I got no
02:04:26 You ruined it. You ruined it. What is Ben saying? I want Ben to say the counter
02:04:32 Understand what he's doing
02:04:34 Wait, yeah, we're we're not understanding what he's doing. I guess
02:04:42 If you are the best minor ever
02:04:45 No, thanks for watching Ben. Why are there?
02:04:49 What why are there two craigs? Yeah, what's up with that? Well, it's because I want to overlap them
02:04:57 I well, there's well, I mean lonely. There's there simply are two craigs
02:05:01 You can get craig and you can get craig too
02:05:03 And with them you you can you can be in two you can be in two rooms at one
02:05:08 How many audio files are we gonna have to stitch together to make this in any way too many? Oh
02:05:14 75
02:05:17 Maybe I mean, I don't know. I'll figure that out. I'll worry about that later. It's not important. It's totally irrelevant
02:05:27 Nothing could be less interesting to me
02:05:29 Then um any are any of the like conversations like
02:05:36 Any conversations we have that are like when you guys like when craig's not in here, uh, is that
02:05:44 included in
02:05:47 Probably maybe maybe
02:05:49 Oh
02:05:51 Unless like you really don't okay. I'm gonna say I'm gonna say assume. Yes
02:05:56 If like, okay, there's anything that you like must that you're like, I cannot have that out there publicly
02:06:02 I guess dm may and be like, please delete that part. I am sensitive to such things
02:06:07 That is cool
02:06:11 Stuff because I I don't know I feel like we we we we had a we had an interesting
02:06:18 Conversation, I mean, yeah, like, uh
02:06:22 um
02:06:23 go on
02:06:25 like, uh
02:06:27 What how do you guys feel about being?
02:06:29 We became friends. We are best friends now the blue team is now a band
02:06:33 Love Nakamas talking about Nakamas
02:06:36 These guys don't know shit about one piece, but I bring something to them that they don't need to know about one piece
02:06:42 But just a german open
02:06:44 Yeah, the german opening of one piece. I don't know if you guys heard about it
02:06:48 I
02:06:50 I don't know if you guys heard about germany, but it's this really
02:06:54 It's a really cool country
02:06:58 Whenever it's a young weave
02:07:04 And but there's a bunch of germans on this call actually
02:07:07 Oh, really?
02:07:09 Yeah
02:07:12 Jews
02:07:15 We might need to cut that we might need to cut that
02:07:18 But okay, so when you're young and we people tell you oh search the german naruto opening
02:07:24 So funny and you hear to it and you are like naruto blah blah blah sask the beautiful and it's so funny
02:07:30 So in one point I was like I'm watching one piece and I really like one piece
02:07:35 What about the german opening for one piece? Is there something out there?
02:07:38 And I searched it I found the the intro the first intro
02:07:42 It's like over over we are the the visuals of we are they don't say oh this is gonna be so bad
02:07:47 And I was surprised this it might be like top 10 one piece openings because it's a really
02:07:54 That sounds like actual pirate music
02:07:57 Okay, that's that's cool. That's cool and all
02:08:00 Uh, uh, and I'm a big one should watch this
02:08:03 Okay, good
02:08:06 Yeah, and riddle me this okay
02:08:09 Have have you guys considered?
02:08:12 Uh making commentary tracks for stuff someone I feel like someone brought that idea up
02:08:18 Wait, it was me
02:08:23 I think like a couple weeks ago
02:08:24 I think like a couple weeks ago
02:08:26 I might have like gone to the pcp chat and like said like hey guys idea
02:08:30 Movie commentary track or maybe or maybe we talk about that idea
02:08:34 I don't care what you do commentary tracks over just fuck
02:08:38 Ben didn't you record a commentary like video thing on uh for at radcon?
02:08:44 Oh, oh, was that the tarantino?
02:08:47 You know, I've never I've never actually watched the tarantino cast so it might be that and I just didn't even know
02:08:53 It's not in the podcast, but we did record the entirety of us watching that movie
02:08:57 Oh
02:08:58 But I don't know if we ever did anything with it. No, no, that was that was spiker that spiker
02:09:03 Video I think I don't know if that was turned into a video
02:09:06 I don't know what ended up happening to half the stuff we did at wreck
02:09:11 I don't know it sounds like
02:09:15 Uh
02:09:15 Okay, you know, you know what I actually really like I actually really like the idea of common like movie commentary tracks
02:09:22 I feel like that would be like pretty fun to do and not that hard
02:09:26 Yeah, I get favor spark to do it because like we watch all these bad movies all the time
02:09:30 In a call and we could just do reg and record. Yeah, because like
02:09:34 All the bad movies he records like half the time we'll like I'll get in a call and watch them together
02:09:38 I'm like, why aren't we like making this bonus content to make you even richer and he's just like
02:09:43 Profiting
02:09:48 At all and it's very strange to me coming from the pcp where everything we do is about making a buck and I'll like say
02:09:53 Look at all these great ideas
02:09:54 I have from the pcp you have a million subscribers
02:09:57 You could make like a hundred times the money and he's just like
02:10:00 I'm like, okay
02:10:01 Like we all get together and hang out like for new years and stuff
02:10:04 I'm like, why aren't we making content and crowdfunding this instead of like
02:10:07 Get here by ourselves. You have a million subscribers. He's like, hey, I'm like, okay
02:10:12 I'm leaving so much cash on the table
02:10:17 Well, that's what we also thought we were so so good such business people that we thought about another idea
02:10:23 Though if you're gonna include this in the in the main like everything we said in the main podcast
02:10:27 Well, that's fine
02:10:28 But you can chop everything up and like I said before but we we we brought up with with the guys
02:10:33 You can feel like your truth your own podcast and make like the blue path. Yeah branching branching paths
02:10:39 If you know if only fucking annotations were still a thing
02:10:42 Oh, yeah
02:10:45 This is like what they were for
02:10:47 For no reason. Yeah, I think we're having
02:10:50 Features this one like the bell and then you're like, okay
02:10:53 I'm so glad they took out annotations to make my subscriber feed not work and have to have like
02:11:00 Really like I'm so glad I get this trending tab, right guys, right?
02:11:07 It's more like the propaganda tag has nothing to do with trending. All right, that's hot
02:11:11 Okay, I think we're gonna soon. We're gonna move on to the to to yellow and then we will
02:11:16 The entire time here, that's crazy, bro. We but before we go. Love us. Should we do our own children?
02:11:23 Shut the fuck up
02:11:25 Let's do a voicemail. Shall we a voicemail? Yes. Oh, absolutely. Oh, yeah, absolutely. Okay
02:11:31 Uh, uh, I'm gonna post it in the blues only chat. This one is called. Um

02:14:05 I
02:14:06 I
02:14:11 I ran away for a reason. I didn't want to study the blade. I wanted to make a podcast
02:14:20 Okay
02:14:22 Did you guys watch the how is the show? I don't know the name in english
02:14:25 But the show with mr. T and the other get more dog and the guys
02:14:29 Yeah, a team a team
02:14:34 The a team, yeah
02:14:35 Then you love the a team was so fun
02:14:37 Like a friend of mine gave me a dvd with like a whole season of it on it and I got I got really into it for a little bit
02:14:45 Very briefly
02:14:46 Okay, that's it. We got to go. We got to move on yellow team. Hang around here. We're gonna join. We're gonna we're gonna go back to the general
02:14:53 Yeah
02:14:56 Later losers
02:15:10 Everybody wants to be a cat because the cat's
02:15:22 We've for concepts everyone in here has named themselves cat
02:15:32 So we became catty
02:15:40 I like I said that I said that could like completely off hand and I come back here and like it's like the entire culture the culture
02:15:48 But often evolved from it
02:15:51 The body you broke you broke the prime directive and this is what happens
02:15:57 So I like yeah cat girls now it's cat season
02:16:02 I like how you the yellow the yellow team's a team chat is like
02:16:07 As it has the least of any other it's just like gang gang gang epic
02:16:15 Everyone else
02:16:17 He said well, that's because we have that saying we have synergy
02:16:21 So we just talk in real life and we communicate telepathically
02:16:25 We really uh, we really uh, we really bonded in the time that you were gone
02:16:28 You use your you use your cat like anal like like scent glands to like
02:16:34 We we had a kind of a kind of a renaissance in the interim. Yeah, we're close now
02:16:39 We don't need you guys anymore. You can get out of here
02:16:42 We have a whole
02:16:52 Oh, yeah, we were going to
02:16:57 The non feline people here, I do want you to guys to
02:17:00 Say you you guys do agree that cat girls are better than dog girls, right?
02:17:04 No, we this is this is a this is not actually
02:17:07 No, I would I do I do agree with that
02:17:10 But it's I mean, I don't think dog girls are very appealing and that's why you never see him
02:17:14 Like when was the last time you saw a dog girl? I I saw
02:17:17 I saw no game no life once as a child and and that's that's formed my personality sense and always but especially in my
02:17:24 regard for dog girls, uh, and and Stephanie
02:17:27 Wait, actually, you know what my regard for lollies
02:17:30 You know what there's actually I just remembered
02:17:33 There's a twi an artist on twitter called they call him cake who draws the the biggest titties and
02:17:40 And his his characters his characters are dog girls. So actually I know I like dog girls better. I'm sorry. Yeah
02:17:47 Oh, no
02:17:48 The thing I associate with with with cat girls is like anime girls with cat ears, which is inherently lame
02:17:56 If you're gonna go with the cat
02:17:57 Yeah, I don't know about that given you do I think anime girls with cat ears are are are slightly better than like full furry
02:18:04 But I think for every I think honestly for dog girls. Uh, that's the case too, but you know, uh
02:18:09 Uh, uh furries are still good and uh are like more iconic at least, you know, like full anthro
02:18:17 Yeah
02:18:19 Like acceptable anthro aesthetic some of it is just like so jank and gross
02:18:24 Well, the problem is just furry artists are bad. Not that anthro is inherently bad. Uh, I think it's for me
02:18:30 I definitely
02:18:33 Disney aesthetics really animals with hints of human qualities rather than humans with hints of animal quality like if you go
02:18:40 Into the human
02:18:42 It starts becoming like really uncanny valley territory, but if it's just like a cartoon animal, that's a cool aesthetic that can be good
02:18:49 Uh, I think I think I think there's a broad base is what you're actually saying
02:18:54 Because for me, I love the disney aesthetic though. Though I probably wouldn't fuck it, you know
02:18:58 And I love the anthro and I love the I love the just like uh, what's it called?
02:19:02 Like, you know, kimono knee or whatever bullshit japanese. Oh, yeah, you know, I like I think all of them are good
02:19:07 And that's pretty indisputable. Uh, welcome to the furry cast guys. Um
02:19:12 Yeah, hey a pcp members. Are you team maw or team paul?
02:19:17 Oh
02:19:19 Uh
02:19:20 More's too like like too close
02:19:23 I guess paul because like
02:19:26 Because because like in real life you get a cat and you pick up the squishy paws like I enjoy that
02:19:31 Yeah, I guess i'm team paul
02:19:34 What do I need with a fucking animal's mouth? Nothing?
02:19:40 I don't understand the ramifications to this question because i'm sure it's heavy and scary
02:19:45 Maul and paul is mouth and paul
02:19:47 Yes
02:19:53 Oh my god, you know, you know, I makes perfect sense actually yeah people who are I love my ma
02:20:02 Who are in favor of ma are all childish and uh
02:20:07 Tit lovers too, you know, that's that's the people
02:20:10 Wait wait
02:20:12 The mommy milky's versus big boobies, right? That's team maw versus team paul
02:20:17 Yes, they precisely
02:20:19 Wait, but they're both big boobies
02:20:23 It's the it's a slight subtle difference preference thing and big boobies won by the way
02:20:28 Big boobies, I thought it was big boobies win. I agree. I agree big boobies pulled ahead
02:20:34 I think mommy milky's is I I've I explained this at some point before but you know big big boobies
02:20:39 Are are like, you know, the foundation upon which mommy milkers stand like no mommy milkers are not big boobies
02:20:46 Without being squares and rectangles
02:20:48 No, the the literal like genesis of that was like, um, what if ready fuckers cup killers, but big boobies mommy milkers like every every
02:20:57 We have a baby lovers and now big boobies mommy milkers
02:21:02 AU universe don't forget pissy baby fucker fappers. Yeah, that's that's the one pissy baby fucker
02:21:09 How could I forget?
02:21:12 You're right that boobies are the like foundation upon which milkers are built. That's like saying
02:21:17 Oh, I I prefer a wheel to a car because you can't have a car without
02:21:22 You know, you are absolutely right 100 agree
02:21:26 Someone was like, what's the more important invention? What's the more important invention the car or the wheel?
02:21:33 The milkers are yeah, but if you're choosing which is the more important invention is the milk
02:21:37 But which is better. It's the better one, you know the one that took the original and improved upon it
02:21:43 What's better the base of the mountain or the peak of the mountain?
02:21:47 This is this is you can't have one without the other. Yeah, but it is where you can it's still the peak like
02:21:55 If you put the peak on the ground and it doesn't have a foundation, it's not a peak. It's so there's nothing it's the ground
02:22:00 Uh, uh, but but it wouldn't be the peak then so it's definitely up high somehow. Yeah, that's why that's quite a question
02:22:07 Other than the base of the mountain. Hey guys, it could be like a
02:22:11 Yeah, yeah, we got listen. I could talk about this all day, but we gotta get going
02:22:16 Oh, oh, hold on hold on. Okay. All right. How long we how long were you hanging out with blue team?
02:22:22 This is discrimination. This is
02:22:25 Well, no, no, no before we go before we go I want to do a voicemail. Shall we? Oh, whoa
02:22:29 Yeah, yeah
02:22:31 Real quick. Um, my cat is literally right here on my lap. My cat just walked into the room. Well, ain't that
02:22:37 Ask the cat four or more. Um, okay, I can open a voicemail
02:22:42 Uh, this one is I'm gonna post it in the yellow chat. So to go look at the yellow chat. Uh, this one is called, uh
02:22:49 Failure is imminent
02:22:51 And we win listen to that. Oh god. Oh god. Um, three are we?
02:22:56 We all played at the same time. Yeah, you played at the same time three two one play
02:23:02 We have to kill god
02:23:04 He's a tyrant a self-righteous tyrant that blames all his mistakes on humans
02:23:10 But what if he's not real sir, then what are you yelling about?
02:23:13 But what if he is real then it's at the top of our drawer list to kill him. We have to do the chores
02:23:19 But how do you kill someone that's omnipotent?
02:23:22 But what if he's just shitposting and he can be killed then we have to do it sir
02:23:27 There's no way you can know that
02:23:29 Failure is imminent. But so is our counter strike. Well, I'd like this
02:23:38 Voicemail so it gets a little bit of credit, but it is bad and not funny. So no, this is
02:23:46 Extremely philosophical voicemail because it sets up a um, uh, what is it a pose mugging?
02:23:53 Uh, it's it's um, oh, what's this fucking name? Hang on
02:23:57 Yeah, pascals wait
02:23:59 Yeah, it sets up it sets up a pascals mugging where it's like we can kill god on the bet that he
02:24:05 Isn't god that he's just lying about being god, which is infinitely more probable than him being god
02:24:11 You know, I I do I do like that
02:24:13 That's a very good hypothesis
02:24:15 But I want to say that this this like performance wise it started out strong and it kind of peed it off a little bit
02:24:21 I I feel like it I feel like it started out at this at at a level and it it just kind of stayed there
02:24:26 Yeah, but it emotionally peed it out by not exceeding my expectations
02:24:31 Yeah, I would agree
02:24:33 And and I have the privilege of some experience with killing god with your lungs sound files
02:24:40 Um, and this isn't living up to the levy jevy ones
02:24:43 There's a little bit of of my mom's in other rooms so I can't scream too loud. There's a little bit
02:24:48 Yeah, I like their use of the hegelian dialectic. Um, I thought I thought that was really effective. I don't know
02:24:56 Um, it sounds like we've got a good writer who should have hired up
02:24:59 There's a you know, there's a lot
02:25:01 There's a lot to love here. There's a lot to love here. Okay. There's a lot to not life
02:25:05 Yeah, can I submit a last minute voicemail in yellow chat?

02:26:27 It's uh, yeah, it's it's beer. It's beer. Okay. Good
02:26:32 excellent
02:26:34 Anyone else drinking anyone else got a beverage?
02:26:37 God, I wish I was right now
02:26:39 I have three cans deep in diet coke
02:26:43 Nice jealous. I have I have a cup of um
02:26:48 water
02:26:49 That I have added a blue food coloring
02:26:52 citric acid
02:26:54 uh, a blueberry flavor extract
02:26:58 and and stevia
02:27:00 And I'm swelling it around
02:27:02 And it feels pretty good
02:27:04 Think until like stevia drops or like the powder
02:27:07 Oh
02:27:08 I have I have come full around. I was using the powder for a while
02:27:12 Now it's all about the drops. It's all about the flavor the flavor drops now
02:27:17 Do you are you you do you do keto keto? Have you checked out my protein?
02:27:21 Like they got some good deals on protein powders my I don't really do protein powder
02:27:26 They're they're not like
02:27:27 It's like not not so much for like working out or anything
02:27:29 It's just like a supplement when it needs supplementing so you're not getting protein
02:27:32 You know just like putting your diet as like because you know, maybe you're not getting enough
02:27:36 It's just you know a replacement or a supplement, you know
02:27:39 Well keto is about it's about fat. It's you want to go high fat like you want some protein, but not too much
02:27:45 God like I went to I went to fucking like school for keseology and like I've hated keto for the longest time
02:27:49 I still hate keto, but like I know it's usefulness and like interventions and how it can save lives
02:27:55 I mean
02:27:56 Like if you think back to
02:27:58 I'm not think back to because you're not a thousand you're not like you're not 10 000 years old, but
02:28:03 Before the invention of agriculture
02:28:05 You were in ketosis
02:28:07 99% of the time and you only had like little bits and bobs of sugar every once in a while
02:28:12 Yeah, that's the natural human state's what we're for
02:28:15 Thank yes one
02:28:17 Correct
02:28:19 Factually factually accurate, but bread is so nice. It goes crunch
02:28:24 It is really satisfying
02:28:27 And that's why it's the devil's invention
02:28:30 I wanted to be unsatisfied
02:28:32 Um throughout my life. I would um, I already am so I don't want to add to that being off not helping you
02:28:40 So why being off keto people say like oh, you know just eat moderately
02:28:44 It's like okay
02:28:45 Well being keto makes it easier for me to eat moderately because when I'm off keto
02:28:49 I I like have no impulse control and I will just eat me
02:28:52 I will eat an entire loaf of bread without even thinking about it
02:28:55 I do keto because I have no self control
02:28:58 Yeah, that actually makes sense if it's more sustainable sustainable for you than keto would be the thing to go with like eat what's sustainable
02:29:05 Yeah
02:29:08 I guess that makes sense. Yeah, do you like one piece?
02:29:12 Yeah, I do a podcast about it
02:29:15 I know I know I know
02:29:18 Yeah, but do you like it though?
02:29:20 Yes
02:29:22 It's it's my favorite thing
02:29:25 I think uh
02:29:26 Ahead of berserk in mangas
02:29:29 It's one of my favorite things too. Like I spent like many hours making this giant one piece video and then
02:29:35 in like
02:29:36 Fucking action giraffes in it. It's sick. It's awesome. Oh to shout it out. It's pretty neat. If you have time check it out video
02:29:43 Wait
02:29:48 I'm sorry, can you what do you mean oh to shout it out a video that you made this is what you're saying to me?
02:29:52 Yes, yes, I I'm saying this like okay
02:29:56 I'm saying it the the special intersection of
02:29:59 Oda shouting out a video that has action giraffe in it is is the best thing
02:30:05 What?
02:30:06 How did this happen? It's my favorite thing ever giraffe is not in the title
02:30:10 I can talk links about but that takes a lot of time
02:30:12 But like so I'll just tell you like, you know how Oda how Oda found it. So yeah, uh, japanese yahu
02:30:18 You know shared the video on like on a japanese news site after they'd been shared around on an amy news network and like um
02:30:24 Some other things that's the name of the video. How do I pass the vivre car?
02:30:28 I pass vivre car and I started the hashtag
02:30:30 It was cool and there's some ambiguity about who did all the work by spent many hours on it and like I didn't get paid for
02:30:36 It was a passion project, but it's a giant cosplay collaboration
02:30:40 Where I basically put a bunch of you know cosplayers from around the world and this giant pass the brush challenge
02:30:45 But like, you know, it's not like, you know next person next person because that'd be too fucking long
02:30:49 It's like a bunch of people on screen. It's a collage. It's basically a fucking video collage
02:30:53 and you know with
02:30:56 It's your own staff's twitter
02:30:58 What they what they do from my understanding is um
02:31:00 Oda sort of like has someone else this like team or two people or one person
02:31:05 Tweet on his behalf and they were like, this is pretty neat and like a lot
02:31:08 You know the japanese have a lot of nice things to say about it and that made me feel good
02:31:12 So now I edit stuff and now um
02:31:15 Nice
02:31:17 I was completely convinced that you were joking and there was no aspect of Oda shouting it out. That was true
02:31:23 But that that's that's great. It's like my yeah, like I asked, uh,
02:31:28 Mr. Best best guy like it's like, hey, could you just give me bare minimum action giraffe
02:31:33 Footage and he sent me like a like two minutes of just static action giraffe
02:31:37 So instead of taking a png I like like uh rotoscope like, you know
02:31:41 Action giraffe out of that video into my video and he plays kakku. I only like color like, you know changed it to make him more like kakku
02:31:50 But like uh, yeah, no, it's uh
02:31:52 It's action giraffe. We got anri okita, you know, very nice woman. Uh in the video. We got, uh
02:31:58 What's we got?
02:31:59 We got some italian hosts and we got a bunch of nice japanese
02:32:03 Footage and the japanese cosplays were fantastic. They all gave me their footage. Um
02:32:08 They all gave me their footage like in a nice folder for me where it wasn't like, you know
02:32:12 Later anything and they gave me 75 clips 76 clips of footage. It was easy. Everyone else was like, oh get to you later
02:32:18 I heated it. I heated it. I was angry all the time. That's why there's two versions
02:32:21 But the newest version has a nail in it. So that's kind of cool
02:32:26 Uh, that's uh, that's great. That's amazing. It's I was expecting it this to be like a viral video
02:32:31 But like it it's only got a few hundred views
02:32:34 So i'm really shocked that it would have made its way to oda himself
02:32:38 Well, no, there's a 20. No, there's uh, there's the one that's like, uh, they linked in the chat is like 20 is like, uh,
02:32:44 20 000 views
02:32:45 But like, oh, okay. That's not that's not that's not like that's the version that was shared and like the original plan was like
02:32:51 To like, you know, keep it unlisted because like, um, some other channel want to like post it but like it's like, you know
02:32:58 America's like it was Funimation's uh one piece like
02:33:01 PR department not PR but like marketing department or something like that
02:33:04 Where they're like, can we post this on the Funimation channel? It's like cool, but they didn't so I just said, all right, whatever
02:33:10 It got enough traction where it was like, I'll just post it on my channel and make it unlisted and like
02:33:14 It was unlisted so people were still getting to the video anyway from the news sites and like, uh
02:33:19 The you know and shit
02:33:21 He's really cool
02:33:23 But uh, yeah, no, uh oda saw action giraffe. I think that's fucking hilarious. That is that is that was funny
02:33:30 Um, shout that from the heavens, man. That's we know the purple story. Okay. Um, we um
02:33:35 All right, we can't we got we got to get moving but before we go
02:33:39 I am actually gonna take this chance to talk about
02:33:43 She's core once again
02:33:45 Okay
02:33:48 Get absolute trash media on the map
02:33:51 Absolute trash media. That's absolute trash media on bandcamp. Did I if you don't know where to start
02:33:59 You you'll just you'll just search for chicago house classics
02:34:05 That that that's a good part of that record label on bandcamp. That's absolute trash media
02:34:12 Sure, I have seen us before and I'm not sure if you recommended it to me or someone else did
02:34:19 But I have seen that I've seen this thing you're talking about. Okay
02:34:22 If you if you uh, don't want to check out chicago house classics check out whopper billionaires come album series
02:34:30 There is come one two three four five and seven
02:34:34 If you want to find uh come six that doesn't exist as an album because that was just actually sarah louise coming for real
02:34:44 And that's all I have to say about that
02:34:47 Um, good. I thought it was really good. Fuck fuck. Yeah, but you're doing great before we go. Let's let's do a voicemail
02:34:55 Shall we?
02:34:56 I've never done a voicemail before can we leave after that?
02:34:59 No, you got to stick around we are going to go through the last two teams
02:35:02 And then we will join up again at the group at the general chat for the end
02:35:07 But um, let's hear. Let's hear um, um, let's hear from uh
02:35:11 Liam cheesy and i'm posting this in the green the green only chat. You see it. You guys see it
02:35:18 Yeah, okay in the green only chat. Uh, we will play this on three two one go
02:35:29 You see I just got this wonderful wonderful grilled cheese sandwich
02:35:34 It was uh
02:35:36 What's the spicy the spicy cheese cheddar jack? I believe I could be wrong cheddar. I apologize if i'm not correct me
02:35:42 Do so someone
02:35:44 I believe it is cheddar jack and it was a really good
02:35:47 It was a really good grilled cheese sandwich
02:35:50 I bet
02:35:51 so
02:35:53 I'm going to assume you're an intelligent person whoever maybe you want to respond to this
02:35:58 And you don't see you're a real cheese sandwich normal cheese you do with a different cheese
02:36:03 What cheese is that because if it's normal cheese, which would be uh
02:36:07 What would you call normal cheese the normal cheese everyone thinks of why did I choose this boring basic bitch ass
02:36:13 clean looking yellow
02:36:15 Pepper jack is the superior
02:36:17 The thing is I actually did and I actually did curate the voicemails and I deleted a few and this one made it made the cut
02:36:24 Me I use clearly my group. Oh, we're actually talking about cheese earlier. So this works out very nicely. Good job
02:36:30 Yeah, let me tell you about the best cheese in the world
02:36:33 Pass this right now. Fuck all of the other cheeses
02:36:36 Best there botans ost best there botans ost
02:36:40 Best there botans ost if you think that sweden is obscure take a piece of swedain
02:36:47 Northern swedain, which is called best there bottom
02:36:52 That's where I live and that there we got the best there botans ost
02:36:56 And you know what motorel sticks everyone knows about motorel sticks, right? Yeah motorel sticks. Yeah
02:37:02 Yeah, take motorel sticks and take out motorel and put the best there botans ost in there
02:37:09 And there you have a button so stick
02:37:12 Yeah, yeah
02:37:14 Oh my god. Yeah, well shit the difference. What's the what's the what's described the taste?
02:37:20 Okay, so it's a strong cheese and it's not stringy. It's not a stringy cheese. It's a runny cheese
02:37:27 And if it's in a solid
02:37:31 State if it's in a solid state and it's not melt if it's not molten
02:37:37 Then it has a lot of holes and the holes are tighter and there are more of them
02:37:43 Okay, I can picture it. I can picture it in my mind
02:37:49 I would love to try it
02:37:51 All cheese is not good. I don't like any of it. I haven't good
02:37:55 I've never eaten a cheese that I felt that I would want more of this fucking christ. Really? This is the worst thing I've ever heard
02:38:03 And we'll give them this information
02:38:06 Okay, listen, I have to I have to go we have to go punish gib for this
02:38:11 So
02:38:13 We're taking away we're we're putting them behind bars. What are you gonna do? Okay? We're oh, we'll leave him here
02:38:18 Leave him here. No, leave him here. No, no, no, no. He's coming. Oh, no. No, she's coming with us. We're gonna fucking twirl
02:38:24 Corkscrew
02:38:26 We're going we're going to the purple team hang out
02:38:29 We will meet in the general chat in a minute and good. See you soon. Very fun. Okay. Bye
02:38:40 Welcome back. Damn. You guys just missed it
02:38:47 You guys just missed us talking about ben Shapiro's wife's drive-up
02:38:53 You know, you know
02:38:54 Oh, we were talking. Were we talking about that yesterday and I thought that that tweet was real, but it was fake. Yes
02:39:01 Yeah, it's so believable. It's something he would absolutely say
02:39:06 Yeah
02:39:07 The one that's like, um, I know
02:39:10 The jokes about me and my wife don't bother me. We know that there's more to a marriage than sexual satisfaction
02:39:15 Yeah, my wife don't bother me. Um, I know there's more to a relationship than uh sex
02:39:21 That's a lie. No, it's a lie. That's a lie. We need we need i'll be in here to get the impression just right
02:39:27 Yeah, it's funny because like if it's someone you thought would be having sex you'd be like, yeah, I know but it's Ben Shapiro
02:39:35 Exactly
02:39:38 Hey, you guys know Ben Shapiro's Jewish
02:39:42 I've heard that
02:39:44 I've heard that. Yeah, that's crazy
02:39:48 That's like the first thing I learned about him. Do you have the recent papers?
02:39:51 Lock it up. It's kind of weird Gib. We look at that. Yeah, why would you look that up?
02:39:56 That I just like I heard about him
02:39:58 You're looking at a list of as a he was a guy in a in a in a that's is in some video and he was like
02:40:04 Honing noobs and he had of one of the funny caps on owning well, so
02:40:13 The hat on so I guess that makes sense
02:40:16 the funny hat
02:40:20 Why why isn't it no bigger?
02:40:21 Yeah, I I always I always thought it was called a a yamaka, but like lately I hear I hear everyone call it a skull cap
02:40:28 I'm like do they change
02:40:30 Is just the Hebrew word
02:40:32 Oh, okay
02:40:37 Beanie but like it's
02:40:39 One that's like more form fitting to your head that's called a skull cap, isn't it? Yeah
02:40:44 I feel like I've heard people for yamakas as well
02:40:47 Yeah, I've heard I've heard people more often in recent years. I've heard people refer to a yamaka as a skull cap
02:40:53 And I thought it was weird. I thought
02:40:57 Why is it what is it? No, come on
02:41:00 Is it is it is it okay? Well, maybe is it maybe a thing that it's like cultural appropriation like to like to say it in their language
02:41:09 I'm thinking
02:41:18 Yeah
02:41:21 I mean, I don't I don't I don't I don't think it I don't think it would be weird either
02:41:25 I'm just speculating on what the motive could be for this change that I've perceived
02:41:29 SJWs
02:41:34 You're not allowed to say yamaka. In fact, all Jews are banned to the ghettos because having them live with us would be cultural
02:41:40 Appropriate
02:41:49 You're slipping you're slipping back
02:41:55 Disavow disavow disavow
02:42:00 I'm probably genetically Jewish myself anyway, who gives a fuck
02:42:06 Ben can be a bigot. He's not one of the goys. Hey, yeah, thank you very much. I love that
02:42:19 Yeah, you can get a voicemail
02:42:26 Oh
02:42:28 Here we go. Here we go. Yes
02:42:30 Okay, in in in the purple chat in the purple chat, we're gonna listen to uh sefirio
02:42:37 You crin you just smooth brained
02:42:40 Virgins who just left the chat somebody
02:42:43 Do you want to give a quick countdown ben? Yes. One two three
02:42:47 Shut up. It's it's in the it's in the purple chat there. Uh, three two one play
02:42:52 They're like two hours on a sunday afternoon
02:42:55 That is like so important that like being on the fucking podcast would have prevented that from doing
02:43:00 I know the answer. It's nothing. This is like a complete like this is like a total like false
02:43:05 Perception to be on the podcast is just to be present when the podcast is being recorded
02:43:10 I'm gonna say it. I'm gonna say it. Um being on the pcb is like such
02:43:16 It is like such an easy thing to do
02:43:18 I actually kind of feel like not doing it is like irresponsible
02:43:22 I challenge every pcb member that is not currently recording or has recorded in the last couple of weeks
02:43:29 To come debate this point come on to the podcast and explain why it's so hard to get onto the podcast
02:43:35 because if you don't
02:43:38 and uh
02:43:40 Checkmate
02:43:48 That's
02:43:51 Topic for topic next next topic episode. The topic is why we can't be on the podcast
02:43:58 And everyone's there
02:44:00 Everyone shows up back
02:44:02 This is a matter of great interest for everyone
02:44:05 Jesse everyone is here
02:44:10 Just like old times
02:44:13 Yeah
02:44:19 I hope it's transition and pre-transition eating and like
02:44:31 All of our pony sonas come in
02:44:36 All of the jennesy characters
02:44:39 Whoever the the the north cast should work on a uh a pcp fighting game next. Oh, yeah
02:44:47 Oh, yeah, just get on that. Yeah, just actually develop the rail rumble like
02:45:06 From that one manga where he's like all his spine's broken, but he'll use his muscles to stand that's
02:45:17 I think it might be I don't think it's was it. Oh god. I don't know
02:45:22 I've only seen a little bit of baki. So I don't know. Yeah, I'm pretty stupid
02:45:26 That sounds like something the way would happen in baki though. Yeah, it's yeah, it's that kind of show looking it up. I'm gonna find it
02:45:32 All right, any members. What would your ultimate attack be in in the pcp fighting game?
02:45:37 Yeah, what would your noble fantasy
02:45:41 My ultimate attack would probably be
02:45:45 I think it would oh, okay. I think it would probably be I summon endless war and he delivers a bone herding beam
02:45:54 Like mirrored like fox and falco
02:45:56 Yeah, I mean when she have like this mirror move sets
02:46:00 Your move says but mirror special special file moves. Yeah, I think I think so. Yeah, I think so
02:46:06 That makes that makes sense
02:46:14 Oh
02:46:24 It would be like peach and daisy pulling on veggies
02:46:27 Like he pulls up winning the poo characters out of a vvhs tape. So if it's piglet, he throws it at him
02:46:36 He gives him honey to recover health
02:46:39 Yeah, I was gonna ask are the cop killer and ben saint two separate characters?
02:46:43 Are the echo fighters or is one I think yeah, I think yeah ben saint is the c1 is the is the
02:46:50 Dimension 1218 one the cop killer is the one that exists in dimension c197
02:46:54 Duh, so so they would be they would have to be different characters because you know the echo fighters because yeah
02:47:01 They have different stats, but the same like moveset. I yeah
02:47:05 I think they'd be I think they'd just be echoes of each other
02:47:18 Munchy's neutral B is that he shoots you with a deagle
02:47:24 Okay, hey, okay, we we've been here in 10 minutes. We gotta move on to pink. We gotta move on to pink

02:48:16 I would expect no better from the from the likes of you. Well, we just wanted to come clean with you
02:48:21 Yeah, and just tell you that like up that the rain fall down and coming cleans my favorite hillary duff song
02:48:28 I love that song my favorite hillary clinton song. It's my it's my favorite song to listen to the nightcore remix
02:48:34 I was just I was literally just gonna say that it's such a good nightcore song
02:48:38 It uh, I can't I can't believe you're unironically agreeing with me. But yes, it's true. I fucking love nightcore
02:48:45 There's a couple different versions of it
02:48:47 And the the good one is the one that has the art of the anime girl like skydiving out of a plane
02:48:52 That's the good one. The other ones are shit
02:48:55 I I definitely have had phases where I'm just like all I want to listen to is fucking fallout boy nightcore
02:49:02 Kesha nightcore
02:49:03 I'll just type it in youtube and just go down the rabbit hole
02:49:07 Like fallout boy normally not great. No
02:49:10 Trash
02:49:11 Yeah, fallout boy nightcore is completely different
02:49:13 I heard a snippet of like some pop song today and I like
02:49:18 I'd never heard it before and I heard like two seconds of it
02:49:20 But I was like, hey, that's like a catchy beat and it sounds like just like some piece of shit generic pop song
02:49:25 I should look this up and like look into more of this
02:49:27 Because I because I'm vibing with this right now
02:49:30 Uh, uh, this this is this is to my boring tastes
02:49:34 Uh dab
02:49:36 I thought you were gonna say that you were gonna nightcore it
02:49:40 No, no, I would never do that. I would never do that
02:49:44 I mean making nightcore it's not it's not just speed it up like a good nightcore mix is like mixed
02:49:50 Yeah, you have to make it. So yeah, so you just beat it up. It's gonna sound like shit
02:49:54 And I'm and I don't have the skills to do a good job with it. So why even bother?
02:49:58 I make a ton of nightcore edits of songs that I need to be faster. Yeah, I have tons there
02:50:03 Uh, do you listen to ag cook? You just put out like a new 49 song album. No, I don't know who that is
02:50:10 He's he's like the creator of pc music
02:50:13 Um
02:50:15 I'm not familiar with that
02:50:17 So he put out a 49 track album and like pretty much immediately after I nightcore like five of them and then put them all on youtube
02:50:25 Because I just needed them to be nightcore. Why would anyone do that to themselves a 49 track album? That's terrifying
02:50:32 I don't know. I think he had a bunch of stuff saved up because he released a 49 track one and then announced a 10 track one
02:50:39 Oh god, because yeah, I can I can barely put 10 songs together much less
02:50:43 Anywhere close to that the 49 track one is kind of like just a huge compilation of b-sides
02:50:49 But it's super good
02:50:51 I mean that is pretty cool. Yeah
02:50:54 Then we came to the conclusion that at the very least this whole podcast is an interesting social experiment
02:50:59 Yeah, yeah, that's my excuse too
02:51:03 Because we've just been hanging out here for like two hours now just getting to know each other at least three random people
02:51:10 At least drunk ben, you know drunk ben knew how to run a good social experiment
02:51:16 sober ben has no fucking clue what he's doing
02:51:19 So sober sober clue is floundering. Oh god. I'm floundering. Oh god go to voicemails. Oh fuck
02:51:24 That's why you're part of the social experiment
02:51:28 Yeah, I'm as much I'm as much as subject as anyone else because drunk ben initiated this whole thing and and
02:51:33 Sober ben is just like his victim. He just has to like live in this in he just has to lie in this shit
02:51:39 That's drunk ben made in the bed
02:51:42 So do you think this is going to do anything to like dissuade you from getting drunk ben out of the cage in the future?
02:51:49 Um, or is it gonna push him further?
02:51:52 No, this won't but other things probably will
02:51:56 Uh, uh, like how I fucking ruined my other roommate's day by waking him up at four in the morning yelling on my fucking computer
02:52:04 Oh, he was mad
02:52:07 And they made me made me upset
02:52:09 Okay, I gotta ask here
02:52:10 So you fell asleep like midway through that voice call and were like muttering no in your sleep
02:52:15 Were you being prevented by dream demons? I was muttering no
02:52:19 Yeah, and it was right as we're I mean it was where we were watching the every no and mlp video
02:52:25 But oh, but you are on the stream. So there's no way you could have heard it
02:52:30 What the fuck
02:52:33 Do you remember do you remember being in the call and like I mean, I do you know that you fell asleep and
02:52:39 Yes, yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I remember that
02:52:41 Okay, a lot of people jumped in and talked around you which was funny
02:52:46 I mean, I probably couldn't hear anything because I wouldn't have had my headphones in if I fell asleep unless I fell asleep with them on
02:52:53 I don't which be
02:52:55 Seems unlikely seems unlikely, but I guess I guess you never know seems uncomfortable
02:53:00 Yeah, aren't you screaming in your heart and wake you up prove the headphone? Well, that's well, that's embarrassing
02:53:08 Terrible just just terrible
02:53:13 Uh, how would you do you guys want to listen another voicemail or you guys want to you know, what do you what do you want to talk about?
02:53:18 And here we got a couple more minutes
02:53:20 I wanted to tell a little story about
02:53:23 uh
02:53:25 Me and some friends met up over new years and some of them were also working on the dating sim
02:53:30 and on new new year's eve like after midnight
02:53:34 uh, we
02:53:35 I I basically we came to the conclusion that the release of a pcb dating sim would either mark
02:53:42 The beginning of the end of the pcb or revitalize the hype and i'm not sure what happened
02:53:48 I'm not sure which of these two things has happened. What what what made you think that one of those things would happen
02:53:57 I don't know because okay, it was around the time that um that we heard that mage left and
02:54:03 like a few weeks a few weeks later fucking, uh, bread happened
02:54:08 and
02:54:09 I don't know everything seems kind of
02:54:13 Uh, kind of climb climb mactical, you know, yeah, yeah
02:54:17 And with rad con, you know
02:54:20 Yeah
02:54:21 Of the other end rad con happened around that time. Yeah, that was three rad con and then there was rad con rad con was a high point for sure
02:54:28 I think on what's a high point, but then this came another dark age and it's it's yeah
02:54:34 I didn't see another one coming
02:54:36 Yeah, so
02:54:37 All of the all of the stuff with with brad and then how it came back and destroyed the videos
02:54:43 That's been a low point. I feel like we're getting back to things though. Like things are videos are being released
02:54:51 If it's another low point
02:54:54 It's it's climbing up
02:54:56 Yeah, the the second the second hack like felt worse than the first the second dark age felt worse than the first one
02:55:03 Oh, yeah, I think it's because it came. I mean the first one came unexpectedly
02:55:06 But it's like since you had already weathered one of them
02:55:10 It just felt sad
02:55:12 Yeah, it wasn't like
02:55:13 It wasn't there wasn't the sense of like, oh, how is what's gonna happen? Like how like what like what is our fate?
02:55:22 It was like we had survived the first one
02:55:25 But we hadn't had long enough of like a time to like feel good because the world had gone to shit
02:55:31 You also didn't have rad con to look forward to
02:55:34 Yeah, no and and then
02:55:36 Yeah, it's just sort of like we didn't get up to a high point before we were brought back down
02:55:41 It just kind of it just kind of felt like the first one had never actually ended. We were just like still in it
02:55:49 You know because it was like technically caused by the same problem or it was like an outgrowth of it
02:55:53 Do they ever specify like the reason why they terminated it?
02:55:58 Or why they like or why they
02:56:01 No, because I know it was related to the hack
02:56:03 But they never really said for what purpose we we assumed it was related to the hack
02:56:08 Because it was just the videos that came out after we got the channel back. I think it was it was um
02:56:14 It was for like illegal activity
02:56:16 Which i'm pretty sure means they thought they were branding banning like brad garling house
02:56:20 They're like ripples streaming or whatever. I think that's what they thought they were doing or what the algorithm thought it was doing
02:56:27 That's yeah, that's what I assumed. I just my that's my theory
02:56:30 I'm not entirely
02:56:31 What was weird to me was the part where you couldn't it was like the old content was fine
02:56:36 But then anything past a certain point got flagged that was fucked
02:56:40 Yeah, that's why it had to be hack related
02:56:43 The only exception was the the rad con stream the opening ceremony
02:56:46 That was the one thing that like escaped the the notice or whatever
02:56:51 Okay, anyway, uh, yeah, that was all shit. It was all terrible. We're talking about
02:56:56 voicemail
02:56:58 Yeah, let's let's do a voicemail and then let's jump back into okay. This is um
02:57:03 Okay, I won't do that one because that's just what we were already talking about. Let's do um, let's do uh
02:57:09 barefoot on the freeway
02:57:12 This isn't oh wait. No, I post shit. I posted in the wrong chat Lamal
02:57:18 Uh a bare barefoot on the freeway in in the pink chat
02:57:23 Okay
02:57:25 We gonna play this on three two one go
02:57:29 Okay, so I'm here with my brother. Um, and we're in California and the smoke is so thick currently that I can
02:57:37 I'm looking at the sun while I'm driving right now. Um, that's dumb
02:57:42 And it's it's fine. It looks like the moon. No, don't stare at the sun
02:57:46 But what I want to complain about is that there's no words at the end of the podcast
02:57:51 Uh, there's just the bum-ba-bum-ba-bum
02:57:54 What happened to this sucking and jerking? Please? Please help
02:57:58 Oh
02:57:59 In the sun my dick. I'm sucking myself. I'm jerking right. I didn't even notice that
02:58:05 Uh, I guess elias are stopped using that
02:58:08 um
02:58:09 I guess I guess the I mean maybe the idea was that the outro was like too long
02:58:14 So he just cut it down to only the music
02:58:17 No, no, no the the music um
02:58:19 Oh, is there not even a tune? There's an instrumental version. I yeah
02:58:24 Yeah, like I've I've in the past used
02:58:27 The uh, the one with vocals and then sometimes the one without vocals most of the time without without work focus, I think
02:58:35 Um, it's just because when you fade it out, you don't want to fade it out in the middle of a word. I guess
02:58:41 I mean if people miss the words
02:58:44 I just want to say I really like the voicemail because it was like an authentic conversation in a car
02:58:49 No, it wasn't any other guy. There's a special guest on the voicemail. Yeah
02:58:55 That guy's voice was scarily familiar to me and that worries me
02:59:00 Uh, dude, I don't know how much can you tell from the cell phone?
02:59:07 It's probably because you've talked on a phone before
02:59:12 But on the other hand, I'm kind of miss the high production voicemails
02:59:16 I missed them snakes. There's there's yeah. Oh man. I remember them snakes
02:59:21 There's one there is one in here that I got this week that was like
02:59:25 Someone just like says something stupid and then starts like playing a guitar or whatever starts like playing the piano
02:59:31 Uh, and I was like boy, that takes me back. That used to be a whole genre
02:59:36 Uh, they they've fallen they've fallen out of fashion, I guess but they could always be brought back
02:59:41 Uh
02:59:44 Was the do you remember the communist hell saga?
02:59:47 Yeah, a little bit. I don't know if it ever
02:59:50 Exactly ended
02:59:52 Yeah, I mean, I just can't I just went on and like cussed you guys out in spanish, but that was about it
02:59:57 Was that you was it or were you part of it? Yeah, I was communist shea gavara the ghost of shea gavara
03:00:03 Okay, I really killed it was the ghost of chairman mal. That's the one I remember is is the ghost of chairman mal
03:00:10 um
03:00:11 I don't
03:00:13 I don't did I I don't remember if the pcp communist hell arc ever concluded
03:00:19 Someone comment. I don't know how did that result?
03:00:22 I think it was it was like a weird thing where many people were like working on responding to another one another
03:00:29 Yeah, it was it was not a centralized effort
03:00:33 It was almost like a weird arg because then it overlapped where there was like the pc police
03:00:38 Trying to take you guys down. Yeah, I feel like that was happening like concurrently and it felt like related somehow
03:00:43 But it wasn't quite the same
03:00:46 There was a whole saga going on for sure
03:00:49 Multiple there are multiple multiple sagas. Um, okay. I think
03:00:53 We should break and I'll head back to the general chat. What are we? Oh, yeah
03:00:58 Sounds good. Yeah. Okay. We're headed back for for I'd I guess closing ceremonies or whatever. Okay. Fuck. Yeah
03:01:04 Last seconds of chill, okay
03:01:35 I
03:01:41 Told you it's not okay. You are a minor. I'll keep it down. I'll do it a little more quietly. Thanks. Thanks
03:01:48 Well, well, uh, we're all here now because uh
03:01:56 Today I learned the pcp fans are the worst
03:01:59 Um, they can't shut the fuck up and I became one of them. I am part of the problem now
03:02:04 I should be put down like a dog in it
03:02:08 Thanks so much. It was very peaceful. The yellow cast was great and peaceful. I think you just had a bad hashtag down
03:02:15 We became best friends
03:02:19 This is a new arc for the pcp fan
03:02:22 Shut up
