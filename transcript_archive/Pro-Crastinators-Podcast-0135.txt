00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:20 I'm the best guy ever, and we've got The Boys, we've got Tom Oliver.
00:00:27 I am here to be on this podcast, but my audience is such a shit, so I'm going to listen to
00:00:34 like 60% or 70% of this podcast, so it's going to be fun.
00:00:40 I'm doing podcasts on hard mode today, I'm on New Game Plus, and I have all my extra
00:00:45 buffs, but I also have new challenges I've never faced before, it's going to be an interesting
00:00:49 experience.
00:00:50 Well that's great to hear, we've got Hippocrit here.
00:00:53 I think Pokemon Let's Go might literally be my favorite Pokemon game, and I haven't
00:00:58 played it yet.
00:00:59 I'm what going to fucking kill you?
00:01:00 I played it, well okay.
00:01:02 Glad someone else besides me enjoys it.
00:01:04 Ben Saint is angry.

00:01:06 It's, shut up!
00:01:07 There he goes.
00:01:08 Uh, an Endless Jess.

00:01:18 Patreon, come feed the swine.
00:01:23 Collab with Lady Gaga.
00:01:26 I can't resist a catchy jingle.
00:01:30 Oh my god, it's another episode of the Procrastinators podcast, and here we are today to talk about
00:01:36 it.
00:01:37 Who are you?
00:01:38 Did you introduce yourself?
00:01:39 What?
00:01:40 Did you introduce yourself?
00:01:41 Well, I said my name, I suppose that's enough.
00:01:43 My reputation precedes me.
00:01:45 That's true.
00:01:46 You know, a bunch of know him well, finally back from the gates of hell, that's me.
00:01:51 I have a thing to kick start this conversation, it's not about Pokemon, let's go, it is in
00:01:58 November.
00:01:59 If only you had a thing to kick start my car, wait, I was thinking, what's that thing that
00:02:06 you have a crowdfunding?
00:02:07 Oh good, you are very good.
00:02:08 Crowdfunding.
00:02:09 It's 2018.
00:02:10 I've been a kickstand, like I have a motorcycle, it falls over.
00:02:12 No, no, no, you failed, you fell flat on your face with that one.
00:02:16 There are so many ways you could have gone with it, and you chose the only one that
00:02:20 failed.
00:02:21 All right, in November, for no reason, I went on a trip to two cities in Europe, and here's
00:02:34 my story about it.
00:02:36 I kind of wanted Munchie to be here, because I knew he would have things to say, such as,
00:02:40 oh good, so I wanted to hear him say those things.
00:02:43 Wow.
00:02:44 Yeah, but yeah, there's basically, it was the first time I had traveled alone to another
00:02:52 country for no particular reason, like I've traveled alone before to BronyCon.
00:02:58 For no good reason.
00:02:59 For no good reason, well it was a good reason, because I have reasons, but usually there's
00:03:05 like somebody there waiting to meet me, or like it's Radcon, so there's lots of things
00:03:10 I don't have to worry about, like I can't drive in America at all, so like I don't have
00:03:18 to worry about driving around when I go to Radcon and various other things.
00:03:24 And it was so stressful, like leading up to going, because it's like, it's a different
00:03:33 kind of feeling where if I just decide to call it off, nobody would be mad necessarily
00:03:41 Nobody is relying on me to be somewhere for something, I can just not go if I want to,
00:03:48 and that is like really, it tugged on me, because like I'm scared of traveling, I don't
00:03:55 like it, it makes me wet my pants, the idea that I might leave my toothbrush on the plane
00:04:02 or something strange, and I'm like, oh no, my passport, I dropped down the drain and
00:04:07 I can't speak to the locals to ask them to help me get it out, because they don't understand
00:04:12 me, like various things like that, and I was like, oh no, everything's gonna go wrong and
00:04:15 I'm gonna be stranded, and I could have called it off, but I ended up going and it was cool.
00:04:22 So it would have been easier if you had some kind of obligation, it would have been easier
00:04:29 if there were someone that you had promised this to, or something you had to do, but because
00:04:36 it was just a thing you wanted to do, and yet the fact that it was only your want to do it
00:04:43 and nothing else made you like, I could give you anxiety, like I don't have to do this,
00:04:47 maybe I shouldn't do this, I totally relate to that, that's why nobody follows their dreams
00:04:53 ever, and nobody should. Well, I ended up doing it, and it was very anxious anxiety
00:05:01 ridden in the first bit, but the reason I wanted to do it was various reasons, one to see a bit
00:05:09 of Europe before it gets locked off from Brexit, and we get like a big old fence, a big old wall
00:05:17 around the entire coast of the UK, we can't leave, also to play Pokemon Go, haha, we don't get the
00:05:25 wall, but you guys do, very offended. I was going to get like a Spanish Mr. Mime, and a German
00:05:34 Mr. Mime, I called it. Hadrian's Wall? Hadrian's Wall, that's a Roman thing. It's like two feet
00:05:41 high, isn't that the wall that sort of goes across like the middle of England? It was supposed to
00:05:48 keep the Scots out, I think, as the Romans built it, and it was kind of small and there's only a
00:05:53 little bit left, it's tiny. Hadrian's Wall makes me giggle. I'm sorry, I interrupted. No, no, it's fine,
00:06:04 it's cool. I expect it, and I feel bad when I don't get interrupted, it makes me uncomfortable.
00:06:09 Yeah, good. So I got like, haha, cool Pokemon, I got some fucking, some exclusive Mr. Mime,
00:06:19 some like, some bourgeoisie, like, special Mr. Mime, I got Senor Mime, and I got Hair Mime,
00:06:26 and they're gonna be like, you know, Monchi was saying, oh, I'm gonna go, you know, give all my
00:06:31 Italian Mr. Mimes over, and then Hippo's not gonna have any spending power in America, and like,
00:06:37 no, I've got special, I'm gonna go to France as well, I'm gonna get a legit like French Mr. Mime
00:06:42 as well, bitch, I'm gonna have all the Pokemon. So like, that was one of the reasons I went,
00:06:47 and then also, just to be more self-reliant and to be more independent, the ability to like,
00:06:54 going to another country is fucking terrifying, where they don't speak the language specifically,
00:06:59 and it's like, if you don't do anything, you're gonna die because you need to eat, so you got to
00:07:06 do stuff every day. A lot of people, a lot of people speak English though, in all like,
00:07:12 major metropolitan areas of the world. Well, alright, here's the thing, in Hamburg, yes,
00:07:17 because Germans don't have, they don't have another nation that speaks German, the German is just
00:07:23 their thing, so like, they understand that if they want to speak to anyone else, they'd better
00:07:27 speak English, because that's pretty popular, but in Spain, nobody speaks English, everybody is like,
00:07:34 like, they don't even have like a phrase to say, do you speak English? Like, they don't know how to
00:07:40 say that, they just keep speaking Spanish to me, and I'm like, I, I point, and then they're like,
00:07:47 they point, and they say something, and I'm like, I don't know whether you were saying yes or no,
00:07:52 or, it's scary, Madrid was scary, I went to Madrid, but it's also cool. I have anxiety about doing
00:08:07 anything, and travel is a big thing that takes a lot of time, so if it's, if I have to do some of it,
00:08:14 it's coming up, I'm like, what a commitment I have to make, oh god, but I'm not afraid of like,
00:08:22 I'm not afraid of like, losing anything, or, I don't know, I've, I've found that like, if you have
00:08:32 money, if you have money, nothing can go wrong, if you have, I was gonna say, the only thing I was
00:08:37 afraid of of losing when I was in Japan was my like, stack of, what, like, traveler's checks or
00:08:42 whatever, that like, was my money, if you, if you have like, if you have like, let's say $1,000 in
00:08:49 like, liquid assets that are available to you, nothing can hurt you, and everything, pretty much
00:08:54 invincible. I had a similar epiphany, I realized that the true meaning of life, the ultimate secret
00:09:03 to having a life that isn't like, too much of a disaster, is just have $10,000 at all times, no
00:09:13 matter how much money you make, make sure that you always have a safety net of $10,000, and that is
00:09:20 your, if anything goes wrong, money, and yeah, that's, that's it, that's all you need. I could not be
00:09:27 more with you, I'd pretty much, that's exactly how I think, yeah, 100%. My number is 500,
00:09:34 might actually, because that's how the whole thing about like, because that's about how much I need to
00:09:40 live another month. I was, I was saving up like, my whole thing about like, when I'll go, you, for
00:09:45 full time YouTube was like, I was thinking, I put a number at 20 grand, when I had 20 grand, at that
00:09:50 point, I'm willing to like, you know, take the chance and do stuff. And I technically have that now,
00:09:56 but it's like tax stuff. And I'm not saying like, everybody has $10,000 lying around, I'm saying
00:10:02 that's the goal that you need to get to, you're fine. Like, I recently like, why will these idiots not
00:10:09 have $10,000? This year, I accomplished my lifelong dream of like, seeing that number in my bank account
00:10:19 10,000. It was during, it took me literally 29 years. So I'm not saying it's easy, but I had 10k in the
00:10:28 bank. I had the however many digits that is, I'm so poor, I don't even know how many digits are in
00:10:32 10,000. Five digits. Yeah, and seeing that, I bought a car, so I don't have it anymore. But yeah, it
00:10:39 was a, it was good. And so now I know that that's what I was good. That's a great goal. Everybody
00:10:46 should have a big safety net. And I mean, everybody should, when they're young, be thinking about
00:10:49 like, okay, well, when I retire, I'm not going to be able to work. So I got to like, save up money for
00:10:53 that too. Those like the short term need to be able to survive. And the long term one, people keep
00:10:58 those in mind, you're in good shape.
00:11:00 It's interesting, because like, in the anxiety I was having like, day to day, a moment to moment,
00:11:07 wasn't necessarily that I would run out of money, because I had like, the reason I went to these
00:11:11 specific places, like one after the other was because I got really cheap flights, one wave from
00:11:18 London to Hamburg, Hamburg to Madrid and Madrid back to London. And I got Airbnb. So like, I knew
00:11:24 that I had money in the bank to spend on lots of things. If I needed to, it was just like, doing the
00:11:31 social stuff, like going into a place and saying, you know, good morning, or, you know, and, and, and,
00:11:40 and, you know, being able to do the, the transaction with someone.
00:11:46 And then dealing with the vicious blows that rain down as you culturally appropriated their language by
00:11:51 attempting to speak it to them.
00:11:53 Ultimately.
00:11:54 Yeah.
00:11:54 How dare you.
00:11:56 You guys ever hear about that? Some people get, they don't like the whole learning of their languages. I
00:12:00 know it's a minority, but wait, wait, wait, wait, that made me.
00:12:03 Who what?
00:12:04 Yeah, I've heard, you know, I'm sure these are fringe people, but I have heard the argument that
00:12:07 learning languages other than your native one is a form of cultural appropriation that should, should
00:12:14 do it.
00:12:16 It's, no, it's funny because like fringe weirdos.
00:12:19 Yeah, you know, it is cultural appropriation, but also appropriation is not a bad thing and never
00:12:26 has been.
00:12:27 So yeah, agreed.
00:12:29 More or less.
00:12:30 Yeah.
00:12:30 Oh, I hate one thing on this whole anxiety thing. You know what this reminds me of a lot? The thing
00:12:35 that I relate most to when I went to Japan, I definitely had this anxiety.
00:12:38 The thing that comes to mind for me with this conversation about being nervous and doing
00:12:42 stuff is specifically because like you just, you went there and like you were saying, you
00:12:47 wouldn't know like dates to meet.
00:12:48 You had no like people that you needed to do stuff for.
00:12:51 There was nothing you just, you went because you wanted to go.
00:12:54 And that reminds me of when I would go out to the club and go talk to girls because that is a purely
00:13:00 selfish act.
00:13:01 And it was in those moments of being in my mind, I knew this 100% purely selfishly wanting to meet
00:13:07 people and, you know, create friendships or get sex or whatever.
00:13:12 The anxiety was at my peak.
00:13:13 Because if they say, if they were to say the simple words, why are you talking to me?
00:13:17 The answer is, Oh God, I have no just, there's no justice on my side.
00:13:22 It's pure what I want to be doing.
00:13:25 And what a, what a sin that is.
00:13:26 What a sin that is.
00:13:27 What a sin that is to talk to, to be a social animal and do the normal thing.
00:13:33 Yeah.
00:13:34 Yep.
00:13:34 Those are, I remember those.
00:13:36 I have no, I have no, hey, galley and argument on my side and no utilitarian.
00:13:41 Well, I guess it reproduced.
00:13:42 Spread my ideas and jeans.
00:13:44 Oh, say that.
00:13:45 I like that.
00:13:45 Say that.
00:13:46 I should have said that.
00:13:47 I'm looking to spread my jeans.
00:13:48 I'm just trying to reproduce.
00:13:49 Spread my jeans, you know, gain, gain social capital, you know,
00:13:55 that I should understand.
00:13:57 Yeah, there was, there was a peak of this anxiety on the first day in Hamburg.
00:14:03 Um, well, the first day I got there was like at night, so I went straight to bed
00:14:07 and, uh, I woke up the next day and I was like, okay, how to find breakfast.
00:14:12 I Googled breakfast nearby and I found a place and it was okay.
00:14:16 It was like, I was doing all right.
00:14:18 But then it became, uh, you know, I was, I went into town and I was like, okay.
00:14:22 Google and type, how to find breakfast.
00:14:26 How to find breakfast.
00:14:27 Well, Google maps has a thing where like you click explore and it's like restaurants,
00:14:32 cafes and it's like, okay, I can do that.
00:14:34 I can do this.
00:14:35 This is easy.
00:14:36 So I went into town to just look around and take some pictures and all that.
00:14:40 And then I was like hungry.
00:14:42 It was lunchtime.
00:14:43 It's time to go find a place to eat lunch.
00:14:46 And I was in the center of town.
00:14:48 So there's a lot of big restaurants.
00:14:49 I was like, I don't really want to spend a lot of money.
00:14:52 Right now, I just want to find like something to keep me going for the moment.
00:14:55 And then I'll have a big dinner later.
00:14:57 But I spent a lot of the time just walking around, looking nearby the shops and the
00:15:04 restaurants and the, you know, the hot dog stands and being like, uh, there's not in
00:15:08 English.
00:15:08 I don't know what to do.
00:15:10 I go up to them and then they, I don't know what to say to them.
00:15:13 So I didn't go up to anyone.
00:15:14 I walked around for a really long time and then I saw a McDonald's and I was like,
00:15:18 okay.
00:15:18 Thank God.
00:15:20 I mean, first of all, no, I'm not going to go into the McDonald's as stupid.
00:15:24 I flew all the way here.
00:15:25 I'm going to have some, some fucking German Currywurst.
00:15:28 I'm going to have some, some legit Hamburg food, but I was, I was, I was dying.
00:15:33 I was, I was anxiety-ridden and I had like the, the lowest moment in my life.
00:15:39 I went into that, that McDonald's and I got fucking 10 chicken McNuggets.
00:15:46 Good old American.
00:15:49 On the touch screen.
00:15:50 Yes.
00:15:50 I don't even have to talk to anyone.
00:15:51 I didn't, I didn't have to talk to anyone.
00:15:52 I knew there'd be a touch screen in there.
00:15:54 I touched the screen.
00:15:54 I said, I got the thing and I just ate them and I felt like a fucking fool.
00:15:58 I felt like the biggest Rube in the fucking world.
00:16:01 I feel you dog.
00:16:02 Munchy would be flipping out right now.
00:16:04 That's why I wanted Munchy to hear.
00:16:05 And it's like, all right, that kept me going for like an hour because it's fucking
00:16:09 McDonald's and it's terrible.
00:16:11 Um, so like, I, I went home, uh, to the Airbnb and I was sitting in, in the
00:16:17 bed and it was a terrible room.
00:16:19 It was like three.
00:16:20 I was going to ask about that.
00:16:22 Was it just like a room in a house?
00:16:23 I mean, it, it served its purpose.
00:16:25 It was a roof over my head.
00:16:26 So it's fine, but like, um, it wasn't nice to relax in, uh, there was this, it was
00:16:31 a shared room.
00:16:32 There was three bunk beds and a TV and there was this fat girl, a German girl
00:16:36 who was like, every single time I came into that room, she was laying on one of
00:16:41 the bunk beds, the lower part on her phone, watching like really trashy German TV.
00:16:47 I didn't see her leave once.
00:16:49 I don't know what she was doing there and her boyfriend would come every so often
00:16:53 and sit next to her or something.
00:16:55 They would just both be on their phones and they're terrible German TV and they
00:16:58 never turned the TV off even until like one AM.
00:17:01 So I was like, I don't know what to do.
00:17:03 Do I beat the shit out of them and grab the remote and turn it off?
00:17:06 Or do I just, that was my first instinct as well.
00:17:09 Or do I just, uh, sit here with my headphones in, but with no music playing
00:17:12 so I could maybe sleep.
00:17:15 Since there is no objective good or bad, how could I ask them to turn off this TV?
00:17:20 That's a subjective value being able to sleep.
00:17:22 Well, the trouble is that nobody could beat up a German because they all have
00:17:27 tanks in their garage.
00:17:30 In this case, the girlfriend is the tank.
00:17:32 Got him.
00:17:35 So wait, I was, so I was in, I came after the McDonald's.
00:17:40 I was like, okay, that was a kind of terrible first day, but it wasn't even late.
00:17:44 It was like four PM.
00:17:45 And I was like, I'm hungry, obviously, and I'm going to need dinner.
00:17:51 I don't know what to do.
00:17:52 And I was just thinking, maybe I could sleep through like the rest of the evening
00:17:57 and through to the next day and then figure it out again.
00:18:00 Yeah.
00:18:01 And I was sitting there for like 20 minutes thinking, no, this is stupid.
00:18:04 I can't do this.
00:18:06 Oh, but I'm doing it.
00:18:07 Oh, I'm doing it.
00:18:08 I'm the worst guy of all time.
00:18:10 I'm the worst at traveling.
00:18:11 I can't do anything.
00:18:12 That was me, my first couple of days in fucking in Tokyo.
00:18:16 And eventually I figured out I could go to the convenience store nearby.
00:18:19 But like, I didn't know where it was the first couple of days.
00:18:21 So I sat there shivering, sad.
00:18:24 It felt very like very much like that.
00:18:27 I was like, this is the worst moment in my entire life.
00:18:29 And it's all my fault and there's no one to help me.
00:18:32 Oh, and I don't even have Twitter on my phone because I got rid of it.
00:18:34 And I can't scream on social media.
00:18:37 Oh, no, I'm sad about stuff.
00:18:39 And so, but I did the same thing with Google.
00:18:43 I Googled restaurants and I just picked one that was nearby.
00:18:46 And I said, I'll just go.
00:18:48 I'll just go.
00:18:49 I got my coat.
00:18:50 It was fucking really cold.
00:18:51 So that's why I didn't really want to go out.
00:18:53 And I went to this place and thankfully the lady understood that, you know, I just
00:18:58 said, I know, don't speak German.
00:19:00 She's like, oh, English.
00:19:02 I was like, yeah.
00:19:03 And then she's like, okay, uh, to have a seat.
00:19:06 And then I ordered a food and I had a beer and it was like this sour pork and it was
00:19:12 very German and it was a very German restaurant.
00:19:14 I had like authentic German food and it was really filling and it was fucking great.
00:19:20 And I, I really enjoyed my time and I like it.
00:19:25 And it was great.
00:19:27 I felt, I felt so good that the fact that I got over this stupid hang up of like not
00:19:33 being able to speak to Germans because it's like trying to speak to anyone, but also you
00:19:39 have to look like an idiot when you say, I don't know what you're saying initially.
00:19:44 Um, and I, I felt great.
00:19:45 I felt great after that.
00:19:46 And for the rest of the trip, I was able to get lunch and dinner without really any
00:19:50 problem.
00:19:51 And that's, that's my arc for that, that story.
00:19:55 Isn't it weird that in Germany, they, they, they have curry versed and even though curry
00:20:00 is like an Indian thing, but curry versed is a German thing.
00:20:03 I don't know.
00:20:04 I think it was strange.
00:20:07 It's just spicy.
00:20:08 It's cultural appropriation.
00:20:11 Yeah.
00:20:11 It wasn't curry versed over there.
00:20:13 I probably just, I went to one of that, those hawked stands where they were selling curry
00:20:19 versed in a little plastic paper plate and I had it and I was like, this isn't really
00:20:25 spicy and it's not very tasty either.
00:20:27 I don't get it.
00:20:28 I don't get curry versed.
00:20:29 But that's probably a bad example of curry versed.
00:20:32 Uh, but yeah, I got curry versed one time and it was like, I got it at like a street cart
00:20:37 and they served to me in like a paper and like a paper fucking, you know, one of those
00:20:43 like paper cardboard foldup things that you might get a serving of street French fries
00:20:47 in, you know what I'm saying?
00:20:49 Yeah, it was fun.
00:20:50 Um, what the fuck's going on with the call?
00:20:55 Okay.
00:20:55 All right.
00:20:56 Let's, let's everybody's issue is flagging apparently.
00:20:59 I'm glad it's not just me.
00:21:02 Yeah.
00:21:02 Well, it's not, it's, it's you and Tom.
00:21:05 I, yeah, it does seem to primarily be a Jesse and Tom, because I don't think Ben
00:21:10 Gibb and I are having it, but nonetheless, that's, that's not good.
00:21:13 That's not good.
00:21:14 Uh, hmm.
00:21:16 Well, that, that's my story.
00:21:19 I went to a place.
00:21:20 I had an arc on the first day and then it was all right from then.
00:21:24 Uh, hooray.
00:21:25 Fantastic.
00:21:26 Well, what about, what about Spain though?
00:21:28 We didn't hear anything about Spain.
00:21:30 Oh, well, I went to Spain.
00:21:31 Basically, the gist is that nobody or pain here's, here's an interesting, uh,
00:21:36 parallel to like the first day in Spain.
00:21:39 So like I got to Madrid and Airbnb, very cheap, uh, in a very poor part of like the
00:21:44 suburbs, uh, like, uh, like a really cheap, um, council house estate sort of thing.
00:21:52 And I was just living in a room with a family and the family was nice and they
00:21:55 had a dog and the dog was scared of me, but he was a good dog.
00:21:58 Um, and I was like, okay, I got a dog, uh, a big fluffy one with big ears, sick,
00:22:07 a big fluffy boy.
00:22:08 Um, so I was in that room.
00:22:10 I was like, okay, it's lunchtime.
00:22:13 I'm hungry and the metro is like really long from the airport.
00:22:16 And I'm really exhausted and tired.
00:22:19 I'm, I can't go on the metro again to get into the center of Madrid to have
00:22:22 lunch.
00:22:23 I'll just see what's in the local area at this point.
00:22:26 I didn't know Spanish people don't speak English.
00:22:28 So I was assuming they would know a little bit.
00:22:31 I go into this bar, um, and there's some guys just at the front, uh,
00:22:37 watching the football going on.
00:22:39 And, uh, I go up to the guy and I say, uh, do you speak English?
00:22:45 And he says, well, I don't know what he says.
00:22:48 He said something in Spanish.
00:22:49 I didn't understand it.
00:22:50 He says, uh, nobody said senor.
00:22:53 Nobody seems to say senor in Madrid.
00:22:55 I guess that's just not a thing.
00:22:57 I guess, I guess that's kind of a fancy thing.
00:22:59 Like, oh, yes, um, madams, uh, it might be more of a Mexican Spanish thing.
00:23:04 Maybe.
00:23:04 Yeah, there's differences there.
00:23:06 So, uh, I was in this, this, this bar.
00:23:09 There's just like three sort of oldish guys who seem to be regulars looking at me.
00:23:16 And then the guy behind the bar and he's like, so what, what are you, you know,
00:23:19 he's saying in Spanish, what do you want?
00:23:21 Do you, uh, like he's trying to understand what I want.
00:23:24 And I don't know how to, to respond.
00:23:28 And I find a menu and I like, uh, I'm looking at it.
00:23:32 And at some point he just gets frustrated with me.
00:23:35 Like he knows food.
00:23:36 So it's like, he, he does like the emotion of like, he puts his fingers and thumb
00:23:41 together and he puts that near his mouth.
00:23:42 It's like, do you want to eat?
00:23:43 Do you want to eat?
00:23:44 And I'm like, I nodded my head and he's like, okay, fine.
00:23:46 It gives me some tapas.
00:23:48 And he says, go sit down with this.
00:23:49 I'm like, oh, yeah.
00:23:51 So, so, so let me get this straight.
00:23:53 You're sitting in a restaurant with a menu, but you can't read the menu.
00:23:57 No, no, no.
00:23:57 I wasn't sitting down yet.
00:23:59 It was like, I just walked into this restaurant and there's a bar in the front
00:24:03 and there was a restaurant in the back.
00:24:05 And I, I was talking to this, I was trying to talk to this guy.
00:24:08 He gives you like a, he gives you like an appetizer tray or something.
00:24:12 Like the equivalent of like a basket of bread or some shit.
00:24:15 Well, yeah.
00:24:15 I mean, it's tapas.
00:24:16 So it's like rice and I never had tapas.
00:24:19 I don't know what that is exactly.
00:24:20 It's, it's sort of like a small, it's like an appetizer for a drink.
00:24:26 Uh, you know, the sort of thing you eat while you're drinking.
00:24:29 So a little nice, little, uh, tasty thing.
00:24:32 And so he gave me that in a tiny little bit.
00:24:34 And I was like, okay, well, I'll eat this.
00:24:36 And then I sit down as a menu and I pointed a thing that seems to be
00:24:40 like potatoes with something on it.
00:24:43 And I'm like, I'll have that.
00:24:44 And he's like, okay.
00:24:46 And he's laughing at certain points.
00:24:49 I'm thinking, okay, I look like a fucking idiot.
00:24:51 These guys, they're just watching the game and it's complete.
00:24:53 Like this foreigner comes into this small, like residential area
00:24:57 that no English tourist would ever go.
00:25:00 And there's an English guy in here, just like being an idiot.
00:25:03 I was like, hey, this motherfucker, you're saying in Spanish,
00:25:07 making fun of me probably.
00:25:08 And I was like, yeah, you know what, it was so ridiculous
00:25:11 that I didn't actually care.
00:25:13 I didn't actually feel bad about it because it probably is really funny.
00:25:17 So like I had the food.
00:25:19 Did it feel like you were just sort of breaking all the rules of society
00:25:24 and therefore had transcended them?
00:25:26 Yeah, like it was so ridiculous a situation to me that I'd never been
00:25:31 in such an embarrassing moment.
00:25:33 There was like, there's nothing that could go wrong.
00:25:35 Like they in that moment, you cease to care.
00:25:37 Yeah.
00:25:38 And it was like a big difference to like, oh no, I can't possibly ask
00:25:43 somebody who definitely does speak English for a meal.
00:25:50 But I can go into now, I can go into Madrid, into a place where nobody
00:25:54 speaks Spanish at all and figure out how to get something in me.
00:25:58 And I was just like, yeah, just sitting there.
00:26:00 I was watching the game with them.
00:26:01 It was England versus Ecuador.
00:26:04 And then England lost, haha.
00:26:06 Haha, just like you in this social interaction.
00:26:09 Yeah, I was just like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:26:12 And I had another beer and it was good.
00:26:13 And then I went back and it was, it was a cool moment.
00:26:17 I figured out that I'm okay in the real world.
00:26:19 I can, I can survive it.
00:26:21 That was a very valuable thing to learn.
00:26:23 How was the potato shit?
00:26:26 It was potatoes alioli, which is I think like garlic cream sauce.
00:26:32 So it's just a bunch of potatoes with garlic cream sauce.
00:26:34 And alioli is like a garlic mayonnaise.
00:26:36 Oh yeah, that was what it was, garlic mayonnaise.
00:26:39 And yeah, it was just a big thing of potatoes.
00:26:42 And I was like, you know, that'll do.
00:26:43 That that's just that's filling.
00:26:45 Oh yeah, carbohydrates.
00:26:47 OK, and a happy, happy ending.
00:26:50 How long were you in Spain for?
00:26:52 I was in Spain for one day less than I was in Germany.
00:26:55 They'll have two days in two full days.
00:26:58 And then one day to get to the airport and leave.
00:27:00 Hey, you mentioned you mentioned a dog.
00:27:02 This allows me to segue into how much I hate dogs.
00:27:07 I hate pets. I hate animals.
00:27:10 I hate in the same way that I hate food
00:27:12 because pets are food just at a different stage of the life cycle.
00:27:18 They're all equally boring.
00:27:20 They're all equally topics for rubes to discuss.
00:27:23 You go, you go like your food thing.
00:27:26 Yeah, it is.
00:27:27 It is the exact same thing as my food thing.
00:27:29 So I'm going to go on the exact same tangent.
00:27:31 Like, oh, you show up, you show up to a place
00:27:33 and there's people there and you go, oh, hey, what kind of food do you like to eat?
00:27:36 Oh, you like you like fried chicken.
00:27:39 Well, I like roasted chicken.
00:27:40 Oh, what kind of what kind of you know what I kind of ice cream do you like?
00:27:45 Oh, you like chocolate with I like strawberry.
00:27:47 Oh, what kind of dog do you like?
00:27:48 Oh, you like fucking two hours with I like great days.
00:27:52 And then this is what people are like.
00:27:54 This is human society.
00:27:55 This is what leaving my house is like.
00:27:57 And I don't ever want to do it again.
00:27:58 I agree that those things like talking about what sort of stuff you like is boring.
00:28:04 And also, I don't know what the difference between dog breeds
00:28:07 are and why you would ever care about them.
00:28:09 It's just like, oh, it's fluffy.
00:28:10 That's all you need to know in my opinion.
00:28:13 Like, oh, it's a it's a half-breed Scottish bog
00:28:16 panel, like what does that mean?
00:28:18 OK, what's the what's the fucking point of that conversation?
00:28:23 Right? What's the fucking point of you?
00:28:25 It's small talk to break the ice.
00:28:27 We all know it's worthless and pointless.
00:28:29 It doesn't mean anything.
00:28:31 But yeah, it's just there to be filler.
00:28:33 I'll break your eyes with this ice.
00:28:35 Do I? Yeah, sure.
00:28:37 It's filler. I do.
00:28:39 I do agree that dogs are worthless creatures
00:28:42 and I don't respect them and nobody.
00:28:44 I don't stand by that.
00:28:45 I mean, I like dogs are like dogs on an individual basis.
00:28:48 Like, I've known some dogs who rise above the pitfalls of their species,
00:28:54 but very few.
00:28:55 Like, I've known like one or two dogs that were like quiet and friendly
00:29:00 and, you know, shut the fuck up and didn't shit.
00:29:03 But only, you know, but that's most of they just fucking yappy,
00:29:06 barky, fucking aggressive, stupid dogs are so fucking aggressive.
00:29:10 They have it's they have their moral,
00:29:14 their moral priorities are just ordered differently from ours,
00:29:18 which they have none.
00:29:19 Dogs have no more.
00:29:22 Yeah, that's not true.
00:29:23 When think when think no, no, no, listen, listen,
00:29:25 since good and evil are purely subjective.
00:29:27 Yeah, when something has different moral priorities than you,
00:29:31 it is evil to you.
00:29:33 It morally opposes.
00:29:34 I mean, that's your fundamental worldview,
00:29:36 making dogs object all nonhuman creatures and most humans objectively evil.
00:29:41 You know what the problem is with that?
00:29:43 That makes people in opposite political sides are correct that the other side is evil.
00:29:48 Both sides are correct about that.
00:29:50 The why is that a problem?
00:29:52 Well, I'd say that it causes some cause some commotion out in that ocean.
00:29:55 If you know what I'm saying, let me let me.
00:29:58 So I have a dog, Lord Sashomaru, and he's he's pretty good.
00:30:02 So the worst thing about Sashomaru, by far,
00:30:06 is that he's very emotionally needy and he hates to be alone.
00:30:13 And so when you're home with him, it's fine.
00:30:16 The problem is when no one's home with him,
00:30:18 because literally almost every time he will shit when we're when people are gone
00:30:25 because he's trying to punish us for abandoning him.
00:30:29 And this is confirmed because like I'll go out for 20 minutes to drop like Michelle
00:30:33 off at work or something in that way.
00:30:35 Does that work?
00:30:35 He takes a shit.
00:30:36 If people abandon me, can I shit and I'll learn not to?
00:30:40 It makes me so unbelievably angry.
00:30:42 Yeah, if it were if Sash were a human,
00:30:46 I would tell him to get the fuck out and don't ever talk to me again.
00:30:49 I mean, so would I.
00:30:50 But yeah, he is not capable of moral consideration.
00:30:54 So I have to just, you know, accept that he deserves.
00:30:56 Does he deserve leeway for that fact?
00:30:59 Well, I don't know.
00:31:00 Does that earn him more goodwill?
00:31:01 Does that earn him more goodwill?
00:31:02 People with the minds of children deserve to be destroyed because they can't,
00:31:04 you know, like maintain themselves.
00:31:06 I wouldn't destroy them.
00:31:08 I wouldn't destroy them.
00:31:09 But I would turn them out on the street and shut the door and let them freeze to death.
00:31:13 He's my responsibility, but I was prepared to accept this life
00:31:16 when I when I, you know, took this burden on.
00:31:19 And he's great in every other way, seriously.
00:31:21 But in this one way.
00:31:23 And so yesterday, so we started when we leave, we have to put him in his box.
00:31:26 Because he's going to shit.
00:31:28 So he might as well do it in his box on some paper.
00:31:32 So yesterday I do this.
00:31:33 I'm out for 20 minutes, dropping off somebody.
00:31:35 He's alone for only that small window of time.
00:31:38 When I come back, he has shit in his box and smeared it around with his pause
00:31:43 on like the floor of his box.
00:31:45 And I have to like, so this is deliberate.
00:31:48 I guess this is definitely deliberate, definitely.
00:31:51 That's the worst.
00:31:52 That's the worst possible thing.
00:31:54 Because like, yes, my dog, my dog.
00:31:56 The family dog that we have now.
00:31:59 He's learned to ask to go outside to shit.
00:32:02 So he's good.
00:32:03 He's a good boy.
00:32:04 We're pretty good about that, but it's not about the shitting.
00:32:06 It's about it's about it's about the.
00:32:08 Yeah, like if you leave him alone for too long, if parents are watching TV
00:32:12 in the other room, he doesn't poop when we're around, he's good.
00:32:15 He will he will bark.
00:32:17 He will bark a little bit, but he's kind of quiet generally.
00:32:20 So like, I don't mind him so much.
00:32:22 The only thing, the only thing I kind of feel bad about is like
00:32:26 taking on my own walks.
00:32:27 And when I throw the ball, he just doesn't bring it back.
00:32:30 And he wants me to go bring it so that I can throw it for him again.
00:32:33 Yeah, yeah.
00:32:34 But like, in terms of like dog problems, I don't really have that many.
00:32:38 It's it's he's quite a good boy.
00:32:40 But that's also because my parents do a lot of the dog walking for for me.
00:32:46 Right.
00:32:46 So like, I'm not wholly responsible.
00:32:48 If I had to do the dog walking every day, morning and evening,
00:32:52 I would probably throw him in the into space.
00:32:55 Sometimes, you know, taking him for a session for a walk, whatever, is like a
00:33:00 fine, you know, like deviations like, you know, I could use a break.
00:33:03 I'll take five minutes.
00:33:04 But sometimes I'm in the depths of working and I do not want to be distracted.
00:33:10 I am focused on my task and leaving it.
00:33:12 And in those moments, especially when I know he hasn't pooped for a while,
00:33:16 I take him on, he will not poop.
00:33:19 And it's been like 10 minutes or something.
00:33:21 That's when the rage that I do experience in any other capacity in my life
00:33:26 got that dog rage.
00:33:28 Yeah, I get dog rage in a big way in those situations specifically.
00:33:34 And I'm like, Cecil, you you've got 30 seconds.
00:33:37 You need to poop right now or or you or you will never know what's going to
00:33:42 happen if you poop inside later after I've given you all this opportunity.
00:33:46 It's just, you know, he's a terrorist and he can't be negotiated with, frankly.
00:33:50 It's really infuriating and revolting just the amount of shit
00:33:56 that dogs get away with that other pets don't, like the amount of aggression
00:34:01 that people let their dogs get away.
00:34:02 Yeah, like no other pet in this world, if your cat attacked people,
00:34:06 you would like throw it against a wall or like get rid of it.
00:34:10 But like, I know people that are I know people that are totally fine
00:34:14 with their cat just attacking visitors.
00:34:16 I mean, like acceptable and they and they and they blame the visitors.
00:34:19 If like, if every time they can die, if every time you walked by someone's
00:34:23 house, like their other pets started making noise and yelling at you,
00:34:28 then they wouldn't want those pets anymore.
00:34:29 But for some reason, dogs are allowed to do it.
00:34:32 I hate barking.
00:34:33 If you have a dog and you allow it to bark, I want to shoot you in the fucking
00:34:37 head in front of your dog and give it to the bark about.
00:34:43 It's like, like Beanie, Nate, Beanie, who would just go nuts,
00:34:48 go into an insane, like some screaming rage.
00:34:51 Like every no, every time dad came home.
00:34:54 Oh, yeah, which was every day, multiple times a day.
00:34:57 And it's like, are you fucking kidding me?
00:35:00 Yeah, are you fucking kidding me?
00:35:03 I have friends who like, I don't want to go to their house just because
00:35:08 when you walk in the door, there's that like five seconds of the dog
00:35:12 freaking out and coming at you.
00:35:14 You know, that's just the person making a choice.
00:35:16 They care about this dog more than the impacts to lifestyle that I guess they're
00:35:21 going to suffer. Is the dog like vicious?
00:35:23 Or is it just like really excited?
00:35:24 No, it's just, well, like it doesn't, it's too stupid to recognize me right away.
00:35:29 So it needs like a moment to understand that I'm not a guy you bark at.
00:35:33 But like you walk in the door and like, even if it's just like 10 seconds
00:35:37 of a dog freaking out, it's too much for one lifetime.
00:35:40 That does suck.
00:35:41 I hate it makes me not want to go to that person's house ever.
00:35:45 Plus, I think like, oh, well, what the dogs are knowing now?
00:35:47 What's it going to be like later?
00:35:48 If I'm just like, being here, is it going to start freaking out?
00:35:50 Am I going to be uncomfortable?
00:35:51 It's going to be like, they're so stupid because it's like, even if it's a dog
00:35:54 that I know and like, like five minutes from now, I'm going to be like petting
00:35:58 you and it's fine.
00:36:00 Like you've seen me before, you know who the fuck I am.
00:36:03 Why are you barking?
00:36:04 Why are you doing it?
00:36:05 You stupid fucking animal, you know who I am.
00:36:08 Why are you making that noise?
00:36:10 I hear that's like beans.
00:36:11 Like every like, like how like beans, you've been living in this house for what?
00:36:15 Like a thousand years now and every day, the same person has walked through the door.
00:36:21 And how could you not have learned that this is a normal occurrence that is not
00:36:25 cause for alarm?
00:36:26 Man, I'm remembering that now.
00:36:27 Thank God Sessho is not like that.
00:36:30 He is quiet.
00:36:31 He's just fine.
00:36:32 That's that's the one that's beans is version of shitting out of loneliness.
00:36:36 Yeah, you know, it's such bullshit that all my life, people told
00:36:41 me and tried to indoctrinate me to the idea that like the stegosaurus had a
00:36:46 tiny little walnut brain.
00:36:48 I know that dogs have a smaller brain than a fucking stegosaurus.
00:36:51 I don't believe that the stegosaurus would ever attack me just for coming in my
00:36:55 friend's house.
00:36:59 Probably I got a friend's house.
00:37:01 If he had a stegosaurus a lot more, you can ride that guy.
00:37:05 It'd be awesome.
00:37:06 I mean, it wouldn't be comfortable because stegosaurus has those things on his
00:37:09 back, the place.
00:37:10 I mean, maybe maybe you could like sit between them.
00:37:12 I mean, it would be the most comfortable to ride a triceratops because they have
00:37:16 like that shield in the front with the crest in the back of their heads and the
00:37:19 three horns.
00:37:20 I thought a lot about this.
00:37:21 I thought a lot about what dinosaurs are best to have own ride and be Fred.
00:37:26 Yeah.
00:37:27 I got bit by the neighbor's dog.
00:37:29 Fucking.
00:37:31 Have that kind of dog.
00:37:33 I don't know.
00:37:33 Some like not even like a good looking dog either.
00:37:37 Like I'm so sick of people with stupid, goofy looking dogs.
00:37:40 Like he's got this like mutant and this big like this like curly white.
00:37:45 It looks like a like a cartoon poodle.
00:37:47 Only it's like as big as a big dog.
00:37:49 It's just the stupidest, fluffiest looking sack of shit I've ever seen.
00:37:54 Just looking at it makes me mad.
00:37:55 Listening to it makes me mad.
00:37:57 So I already wanted to kill it before it attacked me.
00:37:59 But like, you know, maybe it's your animosity.
00:38:05 I've fantasized about being attacked by a dog and just just clock it in the
00:38:10 brain.
00:38:10 Oh, dude.
00:38:11 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:38:11 Oh, that's what that's exactly what happened.
00:38:14 That's oh, yeah, good.
00:38:15 I mean, when I when I walk by a house and the dog is bar and a dog starts barking
00:38:19 at me, I like I freeze up and I think like, OK, OK, I'm ready.
00:38:23 If the dog comes barreling, it's like the fence breaks and the dog comes
00:38:26 barreling out like I got to time my swinging back so I can just clock it in
00:38:30 the face right before it gets me.
00:38:31 You get that dog fighting fantasy every time one of them.
00:38:35 I do get the dog, the dog fighting fantasy.
00:38:39 I get that every time it's a dog that barks.
00:38:41 I'm just like, no, fuck you.
00:38:42 If you start shit, I will not.
00:38:44 I'm not afraid to put you down.
00:38:46 I get that you have.
00:38:47 I'll punch a dog.
00:38:48 Yeah, I'll punch a dog.
00:38:49 Like I get that you have teeth and you think that you're a badass because
00:38:52 you've got like sharp teeth and like a long nose and shit.
00:38:56 But like, I've got fists and feet and my feet have shoes on them.
00:39:01 So like, I can't even hurt my toes.
00:39:03 My fucking feet are too strong because of my shoes.
00:39:05 I can kick you or punch you.
00:39:07 I can headbutt you.
00:39:08 I want to headbutt a dog right in the snout.
00:39:11 We're wearing cloth armor.
00:39:13 We probably, we outweigh almost all dogs.
00:39:16 I want to like, if you have, if you have like a jacket on that can be,
00:39:19 that's like leather armor and like leather armor, you know,
00:39:21 they wear that in video games so you know it's tough.
00:39:23 Like if you're playing like a fucking, like a medieval thing.
00:39:26 So if you're like a cool, if you're like a cool punk rocker or something,
00:39:29 so I feel like when I'm in my leather jacket, I feel like, like plus 10
00:39:33 to power or armor or something.
00:39:35 Cause like nothing can hurt me.
00:39:36 So come at me dog, you don't have a jacket.
00:39:39 Yeah.
00:39:39 Yeah.
00:39:39 Like the most, the most armor that a dog would ever have is like a sweater.
00:39:44 But even that is not like a little bit of a sweater.
00:39:49 It confers a huge.
00:39:50 Like you've got a sweater, but I could totally take, I could totally take
00:39:54 this dog, but it's fucking, it's like Christmas sweater from grandma.
00:39:58 It's like, I can't penetrate it.
00:40:00 The sweater might protect you a little bit, but hey, I've got like a shirt
00:40:03 and a sweater and a hoodie and a jacket on all at once.
00:40:06 I'm like, I'm, I'm like a fucking walking tortoise tank.
00:40:09 Nothing can tell you.
00:40:10 I haven't had like the fantasy of like fighting against a dog,
00:40:14 but I have had like the nightmare fantasy of like, what if a dog is just going
00:40:20 to kill me and he wants to rip my leg off and he's big?
00:40:23 Like he probably just could.
00:40:24 Cause I, you know, I've seen, I've seen Game of Thrones.
00:40:28 I know what happens when your dog's upset and he's got a big sharp teeth.
00:40:32 They eat you.
00:40:33 Dogs like, they think that they're wolves.
00:40:36 And that's what, that's what pisses me off is that this, this, this unwarranted
00:40:40 esteem they have of themselves, where they think that they're tough and they
00:40:43 think they're like hot shit because they're like distantly related to
00:40:47 something that's actually tough and cool and scary.
00:40:49 You're not a wolf.
00:40:50 I don't have to be real cultural appropriation.
00:40:52 That is.
00:40:52 That's true.
00:40:54 The worst is Huskies.
00:40:55 Huskies are the dumbest breed of, of, of dog base.
00:40:59 I mean, maybe there's something.
00:41:00 And it's even more annoying because like, because Huskies are like beautiful
00:41:04 and you want them to be cool because they're like really cool dogs,
00:41:08 but they're also the most one of the most ill behaved.
00:41:13 They just, yeah, they're loud, annoying.
00:41:14 You know, I've often wondered.
00:41:16 So the only weapon that a dog, they're the jocks of dogs, they are the
00:41:21 retarded jocks of dogs.
00:41:22 Good looking, good looking, you know, you know, powerful retard.
00:41:26 Isn't it a bad, a bad design that like a dog's, so wolves have like, I guess
00:41:32 they have claws, right?
00:41:33 They could like, of course they'd hurt you.
00:41:35 Okay.
00:41:36 Good looking, no, no dog has that.
00:41:38 They are, they are.
00:41:39 But like, no, I just like that.
00:41:40 It's like a title.
00:41:41 It's when it, when it tries to bite you, like a dog or wolf, it's like brain
00:41:45 dome is right there.
00:41:47 It's right there.
00:41:47 And I feel like I could definitely get a few shots in.
00:41:50 You can crack down on your arm.
00:41:53 Yeah, you could just start punching it in the eyes, you know, something.
00:41:56 That's what I would do.
00:41:57 Yeah.
00:41:57 Yeah, like this fork, this take all but the biggest dogs, even unarmed.
00:42:01 This stupid, like giant poodle fucker from my neighbor that attacked me.
00:42:05 Like what happened was, because like I had just gotten my car.
00:42:09 And you know how like, if you've ever gotten a car, like the first week
00:42:13 something goes wrong and it's the most infuriating thing in the world.
00:42:16 Sure.
00:42:16 Right.
00:42:16 So like, right, like the first week I had my car, suddenly the door
00:42:20 wouldn't close and I came to find that like the latch on the door was like rusty
00:42:24 and it wouldn't like latch when I closed the doors.
00:42:26 It would like bounce off the frame when I tried to close the door.
00:42:29 So I'd have to slam it shut.
00:42:31 But then if I like slammed it shut, then I would be stuck in the car
00:42:33 and I wouldn't be able to open it again.
00:42:35 So for, so like I couldn't open the door and I would have to like crawl
00:42:38 over the center console from the passenger door.
00:42:41 It was so horrible.
00:42:42 And like this is a car that I just bought.
00:42:44 It was like, you know, massively expensive.
00:42:46 I was so fucking angry getting in and out of the car.
00:42:49 Like before I fixed this, I did eventually fix it.
00:42:51 But like, like I got out, I drove into my driveway already steaming mad
00:42:57 thinking that it would happen.
00:42:58 And of course it did.
00:42:59 I got out of the car, I go to close the door.
00:43:01 It's it's slams and bounces off the frame a bunch of times.
00:43:05 I can't fucking I'm bouncing it off the frame.
00:43:07 He's going boom, boom.
00:43:09 And it's like it's making like a loud noise every time it's bouncing off the
00:43:12 frame and the loud noise of bouncing off of it is making the neighbor's dog go
00:43:15 fucking ape shit, of course, because God forbid anyone else make a noise.
00:43:19 God forbid anyone but you, the fucking dog is the only one allowed to make
00:43:22 noise in this fucking world.
00:43:24 That's that's just tacitly giving it permission.
00:43:26 Yeah.
00:43:27 So like I'm trying to finally, I fucking am trying to like slam it shut.
00:43:33 And the fucking neighbor she has a door open, I guess, or whatever the fuck.
00:43:37 So the dog runs out, runs at me, literally jumps up and like bites a
00:43:42 chunk out of my arm and I fucking I threw it off.
00:43:47 The neighbor lady is like freaking out because like, oh, my God, my dog is
00:43:52 she's thinking that she's going to get sued.
00:43:54 I'm not going to sue anyone.
00:43:55 I'm just going to kill you, lady.
00:43:56 So don't worry.
00:43:57 Right.
00:43:57 I'm going to kill you and your dog and your whole family.
00:44:00 Don't worry about me.
00:44:01 I'm not going to get involved with lawyers or anything.
00:44:03 But so like I throw the dog off and I'm swearing up a storm and I'm yelling
00:44:06 and the lady's like, oh my God, what happened?
00:44:08 I'm like, shut the fuck up.
00:44:09 And so like the dog is like still barking.
00:44:13 And I swear to God, I had this moment where I just I turned
00:44:17 and I like pennant stared right into the fucking dog's eyes.
00:44:20 I stared right at it.
00:44:22 I just looked at it and I gave it a look and like the dog.
00:44:26 I think in that moment, the dog became aware that I am capable of murder.
00:44:31 And he feared for his life.
00:44:33 And he just like backed away with his stupid tail tucked between his legs.
00:44:38 It was it was it was, you know, annoying, but it was a little bit
00:44:42 uplifting to me to know that I could create a look on my face that
00:44:46 communicates to a lesser beast that I will fuck you up.
00:44:50 Got that you got that conquerors hockey.
00:44:53 Yeah, I was going to say, yeah, yeah, the ability to intimidate big power on
00:45:00 on a on a somewhat similar note to the dog fighting fantasy.
00:45:04 I have I have I think about what if my house caught fire?
00:45:09 Could I save my computer?
00:45:11 Yeah, good question.
00:45:12 And then yesterday, someone actually
00:45:16 remember Nuzlocke genocide?
00:45:18 Remember bananas, the masculine? Of course, it was that guy.
00:45:21 It was generally bananas, who was who was the names that he just tweeted
00:45:25 that his house caught fire and but he managed to save his computer.
00:45:30 And I was like, huh, I think about myself in that situation all the time.
00:45:37 So I like, you know, replied like, you know, glad you got the computer out
00:45:41 and also yourself or something.
00:45:43 Yeah, yeah, as an afterthought.
00:45:46 And yeah, I don't know.
00:45:48 I often often.
00:45:50 It would be very difficult.
00:45:52 I feel like I mean, I could I think what I would do if my house caught fire
00:45:57 and it was like in like the house is filling up with smoke.
00:45:59 And maybe I just have like maybe a minute, right?
00:46:01 Maybe it's like I need to get out as fast as I can or I'm risking life in limb.
00:46:05 I mean, I think I would probably just, you know, grab my computer tower.
00:46:09 Right. Unplug everything.
00:46:11 Unplug, you know, leave the monitors, leave, whatever, grab my hard drives
00:46:14 and my computer tower and run outside with that.
00:46:16 You know, the other stuff is like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:46:19 Man, I would be like preserve the preserve the data.
00:46:22 I would be having a real Sophie's choice between my computer tower and my laptop
00:46:28 because like like the tower has like Vegas on it and all of my like working stuff.
00:46:35 And like my Vegas was is pirated for me by someone smarter than me.
00:46:40 So if I lose it, if I would never be able to get it back
00:46:43 because I'm not paying for it, I'm too stupid to ever pirate myself.
00:46:47 So like I would I would lose my career if I lost the tower,
00:46:51 which might be a blessing in disguise, but like true.
00:46:55 The but the laptop has like everything I've ever written for the last 10 years on it.
00:47:01 So like, do I save like 10 years of ideas or do I save the fucking machine
00:47:06 that allows me to put them into use?
00:47:09 Oh, you could get Vegas again.
00:47:10 Do you know like right in Google ducks?
00:47:13 No, I don't because I'm you know what?
00:47:15 I write I have the worst fucking system.
00:47:18 If something happens to the laptop, I'm totally fucked
00:47:20 because I write everything in this MacBook notes program.
00:47:25 And you cannot convert those to anything else.
00:47:29 You can't get them in like a real file.
00:47:31 You can't like move them to the to the tower or back them up.
00:47:34 I figured out I had to look up how to back them up,
00:47:37 but they're still in like a weird format.
00:47:38 I'm fucking so I guess I'm just lying.
00:47:40 I guess I'm fucking make it shit up, but the point is it's like
00:47:45 it's slightly difficult to back up the files.
00:47:47 It's like one extra step so I can never do it effectively impossible.
00:47:52 I have, you know, I have like a lot of the times I will
00:47:56 I have redundant copies of things like I have show on my computer.
00:47:59 I have some of the stuff is backed up for my old computer.
00:48:01 Some of that stuff is backed up for my old laptop.
00:48:03 Some of that stuff is backed up on Google Drive or, you know, in Google documents or whatever.
00:48:07 Yeah, I have no idea.
00:48:09 Like it's it's a lot of it is redundant, but I have no clue where I saved anything.
00:48:13 Like I have a bunch of email accounts and like, you know,
00:48:17 who fucking knows where like which account I saved what in.
00:48:20 Right. Right.
00:48:21 So like a lot of stuff probably would be recoverable,
00:48:24 even if my computer was destroyed, but it would be a huge hassle.
00:48:29 And then not everything, especially the newer stuff.
00:48:31 Yeah, I mean, I'm basically the same, but I do basically organize things by like category.
00:48:37 Like I've got like best guy ever, then I've got like a bunch of personal ones
00:48:40 and I've got like a professional one and yeah, so like I keep them separate.
00:48:45 I'm pretty good. I'm pretty good on that.
00:48:46 You guys's file management sounds terrifying to me
00:48:50 because I'm constantly paranoid about my data being deleted
00:48:54 because I've had too many bad experiences and I know it's a matter of time.
00:48:58 So what I did any of us long ago and thank God I did it when I did
00:49:03 because they don't do this anymore is the dropbox.
00:49:06 Right. I have all my important shit in Dropbox
00:49:09 and Dropbox is the best program ever made because what it does
00:49:12 is that everything's backed up to the cloud, but it also makes a local copy on your computer.
00:49:17 So it's always local, you never have to download anything,
00:49:20 but it's always being backed up all the time.
00:49:22 And then everything on Dropbox has revision history.
00:49:26 So if I ever accidentally save something I don't want to,
00:49:29 I just go to Dropbox.com and just roll back to the previous version.
00:49:32 And it's right back on my computer.
00:49:33 So it's the best thing ever made by even.
00:49:35 That's pretty good.
00:49:36 But here's that's pretty here's the problem.
00:49:37 The problem is Dropbox is only two gigs for free, which is not enough space.
00:49:43 So what they had back in the day was a referral program back when Dropbox was new.
00:49:48 It was like everybody you get to sign up for Dropbox,
00:49:50 you get an extra 250 megs on your free space.
00:49:53 And I'm like, and this is back in the pony days.
00:49:55 And I was like, I can abuse this.
00:49:57 So I go on D and I go on Twitter and I'm just like, use this link, just do it.
00:50:00 And now I'm up to like 25 gigs for free on Dropbox and that's enough.
00:50:04 That's enough for all my essential shit.
00:50:06 So I've screwed the system over.
00:50:07 And now every time I get a new computer or set something up, which is all the time,
00:50:12 I just download Dropbox and everything's there.
00:50:14 And I feel like God and I don't worry about files ever.
00:50:20 Well, I'm a little jealous.
00:50:22 That's pretty good.
00:50:22 Although, I mean, 25 gigs is not.
00:50:26 I mean, like I just I got a new I just got a new hard drive.
00:50:29 And I think it was Fat 32, that fucking villain.
00:50:33 The ultimate arch nemesis of the PC.
00:50:34 Yeah, yeah, because like there was some video files that I was moving
00:50:37 and I think it wouldn't take them because they were over four gigs.
00:50:39 Ugh, maybe it's actually like a squad.
00:50:41 It's the Fat 32 and it's 32 fat dudes.
00:50:45 Well, Fat 32 is evil and he's fat because he ate one through 31.
00:50:49 Can't wait for him to make his official debut in the Royal Rumble at Rat Cross.
00:50:52 The Royal Rumble. Hell yeah.
00:50:55 So, but I reformatted it.
00:50:57 You know, I finally finally I can use it now.
00:50:59 So I've got new space.
00:51:00 The problem is just choosing what I want to get off my main because
00:51:03 because like recording this, I only have like nine gigs free
00:51:06 on my main hard drive for some reason.
00:51:08 I don't know why that is because I had like 15 yesterday and I don't know what happened.
00:51:12 You got to download Windows, stat, Windows, directories.
00:51:16 You know what?
00:51:16 I'm going to empty my recycle bin right now.
00:51:18 Maybe that will help.
00:51:19 That's a good idea.
00:51:20 That's great.
00:51:21 But, you know, at work, you know, because I software program and all that,
00:51:25 we we we heavily and strictly control all file updates that get checked
00:51:31 into our our VCR or VC, whatever, our version control software, VCS, I guess.
00:51:38 Oh, you know, you know, Hippo, I do I do use Windows stat that you recommended to me.
00:51:42 It's great.
00:51:44 Yeah, it shows you like a visualization of your hard drive in terms of like how
00:51:47 much space is taken up by what and you can sort of like look.
00:51:50 Yeah, yeah. And I want that right now, dude.
00:51:51 It's the best it shows you like a grid and you can just look at like
00:51:55 the biggest squares in the grid and it'll tell you like, Oh, yeah.
00:51:58 This is, you know, HTTP colon slash slash pornography folder.
00:52:02 Oh, hell yeah.
00:52:03 Hell, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:52:04 I have a funny story with Windows stat, which is not really funny,
00:52:07 but I just find it in music because I'm a tech guy is that I bought this
00:52:10 like I bought a tower when I when I moved in with the digits.
00:52:14 Now I can have a tower again.
00:52:15 And I got this like HP workstation like super cheap because it's like old,
00:52:19 but it's still like super powerful.
00:52:20 It's one of those computers that used to cost like $6,000 when it came out.
00:52:24 So now it's only like 500, but it's still good.
00:52:27 So I was like, I'm poor, so I'll get that.
00:52:29 And it has 48 gigs of RAM and two six core processors.
00:52:36 Dang, that's not very much.
00:52:39 It's a lot. It's a lot.
00:52:41 It's a fuck ton.
00:52:42 Oh, oh, oh, of RAM, 48 gigs of RAM.
00:52:45 Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
00:52:47 So so I was using it and I realized immediately that I was running out of space.
00:52:51 And I'm like, how is this possible?
00:52:52 Because I have a 250, 60 SSD.
00:52:54 I should have space.
00:52:55 And then I opened up Windows that I was like, oh, of course,
00:52:58 what Windows does is every time what it does, it makes like a swap file
00:53:02 on your hard drive, like has like reserve space and it defaults to double your RAM size.
00:53:06 So I just have 96 gigs of my 250 SSD is a swap file.
00:53:11 And I'm just like, oh, fuck.
00:53:13 I guess when you have this much RAM, you need more hard drive space now.
00:53:18 And it was just like this huge fucking enormous square on Windows.
00:53:23 That like what in God's name is that?
00:53:24 And it's just like the fucking cache file that you can't get rid of.
00:53:28 I'm like, OK, well, shit.
00:53:32 I'm your fuck, dude.
00:53:35 Your fuck. But I have 48 gigs.
00:53:37 I feel I feel like I should mention just in case people don't know.
00:53:41 But on Google Docs,
00:53:43 documents that are just writing take up zero space.
00:53:47 They do. You can have an unlimited amount of those.
00:53:50 It's a very valuable thing to know, which is why I think, Jesse,
00:53:53 if you can, like try to copy paste all of those onto there.
00:53:56 Yeah, that's a really good idea. You'll never run out.
00:53:59 What if what if what do you know how like on Microsoft Word,
00:54:02 you can like embed music and stuff into documents and things like that?
00:54:05 What if you could do that on Google Drive and they still took up zero space,
00:54:08 just have this crazy piracy network where it's just like every MP3 ever in a document.
00:54:12 It takes up zero space on your drive.
00:54:15 That would be pretty dope.
00:54:18 Hey, hey, I've got the system works.
00:54:21 I've got an update for people from last PCP.
00:54:24 If you recall, Redaway, run every day until I'm hot.
00:54:28 Yeah, the program I'm doing now, I just want to give everybody an update.
00:54:32 I'm doing it so far. No flaws. Perfect job.
00:54:35 I am the best.
00:54:37 But I have something retarded to say about that.
00:54:40 When you when I first heard Redaway run every day until I'm hot,
00:54:44 I did Redaway.
00:54:45 I did not. I did not realize that the hot was your physical experience.
00:54:50 I thought you just meant run until you felt hot, like got hot.
00:54:53 Oh, I'm like, that sounds like a really pushy running regimen.
00:54:56 That'll take like a minute.
00:54:58 What? No. God damn it.
00:54:59 It's a lifestyle change.
00:55:01 Until you start to say, yeah, that's not like, whoa, that's enough, man.
00:55:04 That's initially what I thought it meant.
00:55:07 And I was like, well, I guess that will slowly get better as your endurance increases.
00:55:11 But but then I realized, oh, I'm being a fool because I'm not thinking of Nate that way.
00:55:16 Well, apparently, other people thought that too.
00:55:18 So OK, OK, OK, OK, well, no, it's about about changing lifestyle.
00:55:23 So so actually, a dude messaged me the other day.
00:55:26 This was yesterday and he sent me he heard of my epic tale
00:55:30 from the last PCP episode.
00:55:32 Wait, which epic tale about how I'm doing this, how I'm doing this.
00:55:36 OK, this is Captain Suppey.
00:55:37 I've heard the name somewhere before.
00:55:40 But he apparently is like a dope ass run boy who runs like,
00:55:45 I don't know, it's not professional.
00:55:46 He's not his college team or something.
00:55:48 He sent me a big old document illustrating how my efforts are are going to overtax my body
00:55:55 because I'm going to fuck myself up if I actually run every day as as like a noob, which I am.
00:56:00 And so he just broke it down into like a bunch of sections for like for your first
00:56:04 like two to three. What would he say?
00:56:06 Let me let me let me.
00:56:07 This is funny, actually.
00:56:07 Let me read like the little intro thing you put here.
00:56:10 Let me see. OK, so this is his intro paragraph, which is I like this a lot
00:56:14 because what he's doing is he's establishing why I should care about his opinion,
00:56:18 which is the most important thing with this.
00:56:20 So yeah, that's the stick.
00:56:21 That's the sticking point for me.
00:56:23 Yeah, of course, because like he could just be some fat nobody who doesn't know a goddamn thing.
00:56:27 But he says, OK, I want to preface this by saying I know my shit.
00:56:31 Oh, by the way, he wrote this whole thing yesterday while high
00:56:35 as he explained to me as he was doing it.
00:56:38 OK, so I've been a runner since I was 12.
00:56:40 I've done everything from track to cross country, have ran three half marathons,
00:56:44 have a 455 mile and an 1820 five K PR.
00:56:49 But I'm going to give you advice based on the fucking casual.
00:56:52 I know you are. Don't worry.
00:56:54 I'm not trying to have you break records.
00:56:56 I know all you want us to lose those annoying small but noticeable flabs.
00:57:00 So with that, let's just jump into it.
00:57:03 And then he just breaks it down for like a couple of weeks.
00:57:06 And he says to run like starts off two to three times per week
00:57:09 and then up to like four to five times per week and shit.
00:57:12 But it's good. And you see, I just I want to use this as an example.
00:57:15 People of even though my program definitely was not optimal, it was not perfect.
00:57:21 It got me going and it gets people.
00:57:23 I know I have an internet presence, so like I'm more likely to get things like this.
00:57:27 But like, maybe you know somebody in your life.
00:57:29 I'm just saying the the power of doing something as opposed to nothing
00:57:33 to get you moving in the right direction is a very strong thing.
00:57:37 I appreciate this guy's effort and his credentials do seem good,
00:57:41 especially if they're assuming they're true, which I don't know.
00:57:44 But on the other hand, you got to you got to think about our boy
00:57:47 Saitama, who just ran every day and became the strongest man in the universe.
00:57:52 So I don't know. One of these people.
00:57:55 So this guy wants this guy wants you to miss out on that.
00:57:57 Yeah, that's trying to sabotage.
00:57:58 You know, the one thing about this is I was saying this last time
00:58:02 and I still think this is true.
00:58:03 It's easier for me to just say I need to run every day like to myself as a rule
00:58:10 as opposed to, oh, yeah, I'm going to run like three times per week.
00:58:13 And I'll just mark those on the calendar because then like I might just fuck up and be like, oh, I feel the same way.
00:58:18 Do you have the problem that I have?
00:58:20 Do you have the problem of like universal willpower?
00:58:24 Do what I mean by that is that, OK, I'll just use an example.
00:58:28 Thanksgiving just happened a couple of days ago.
00:58:31 And broke Keto to do Thanksgiving.
00:58:35 I was doing right. Are you back on Keto?
00:58:37 I kind of thought you had quit.
00:58:38 I was I'm considering it still.
00:58:40 I'm trying to like I'm trying what I'm trying to do right now is before I just quit completely.
00:58:43 I'm just trying to cut out diet soda entirely because I don't know if it's diet.
00:58:46 So that's making me sick or just the diet in general.
00:58:50 And feel sick, Ben. So that's the priority, whatever.
00:58:52 OK, yeah, but the thing is the point of coming with like universal willpower is that
00:58:57 so I broke Keto to like, you know, be with family, have have food,
00:59:00 be a disgusting degenerate, eating sugar.
00:59:02 Yep. Sugar actually tasted odd and I didn't like it.
00:59:06 But that's great. That's a side point.
00:59:08 But but after that, like for the last couple of days,
00:59:11 I have like been significantly weaker, not only in my diet, but in everything.
00:59:17 Like getting to work takes more effort now.
00:59:20 Being like getting up at a decent hour, which has always been bad, is more difficult.
00:59:25 I rolled out of bed because I got a message from my phone,
00:59:28 which was Nate saying it's PCP time.
00:59:30 I'm like, fuck, it was like eight, like three seconds ago.
00:59:32 So just just just one breaking of like habit has ruined everything.
00:59:37 Everything's all tied together. It's the worst.
00:59:39 And if you want to be a god, you have to be perfect because that's what a god is.
00:59:44 Yes. I mean, yeah, yeah.
00:59:46 Yeah, as soon as you succumb to one weakness of the flesh,
00:59:49 it all comes crumbling down like that.
00:59:51 I definitely feel like the big way went out to Boston.
00:59:55 It's the way what what did you fuck up in Boston?
00:59:58 We went to Boston and we were playing Jenga
01:00:00 and I totally fucked it up last minute and it was it was sick.
01:00:04 Did did you lose?
01:00:05 I was the one who lost Jenga.
01:00:06 Yeah, it's my hand tremble because I had I remember I had a good move
01:00:10 where I hand trembled and it all went to fucking shit.
01:00:12 And Munchy was playing.
01:00:13 I was trying to do it to put way more pressure on me.
01:00:17 In we played Jenga in that in that like China Chinatown like bubble tea shop
01:00:22 and they had like all the the bricks for the Jenga set had like shit written on them.
01:00:28 And some of them just had people's phone numbers written on them.
01:00:30 And I just picked one up and called in in in the store.
01:00:34 Is it a local hot mom looking for a quick sex?
01:00:37 It sounded like no joke.
01:00:40 It sounded like a cutie Asian honey pie.
01:00:43 Yeah, it sounded like a cute Asian girl who was like really shy.
01:00:46 And like she was like, hello, like I didn't even hear any words.
01:00:50 Right. I heard like some kind of whisper, some sort of like vague whisper
01:00:53 of like acknowledgement that a phone call had been received.
01:00:56 And I just said like, hello, you know, I found your number on a Jenga block.
01:01:00 And I just wanted to say that you're that, you know, have a
01:01:03 they want to wish you a happy day and let you know that you're a good person or something.
01:01:07 And she just started laughing.
01:01:09 That's funny. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
01:01:11 She literally should have married this woman while you had.
01:01:14 I mean, I made, I took pains to make this not a traumatic or scary experience.
01:01:19 It was an oddly upbeat interaction.
01:01:22 Yeah, you've got her number, though, and she can't escape that.
01:01:25 It's true. I guess so.
01:01:26 I guess it's in my phone somewhere.
01:01:28 If I wanted to wait a little bit longer, then you just hit her up again.
01:01:31 You're like, so what are you doing?
01:01:33 No, why not? Remember that time?
01:01:35 Remember that time I found your number on a Jenga block.
01:01:38 Well, it's time to pay the pipe. Yeah.
01:01:40 She could be 45 or, I don't know, who knows, with these Asian ladies
01:01:44 sounding young when they're not, I don't know.
01:01:46 But anyway, hey, hey, Captain Suppy, I'm sure that he's like correct in his plan,
01:01:51 but I still feel a desire to do it every day.
01:01:54 So I'm going to probably keep doing that, at least for a little while.
01:01:57 Although my left ankle, something's going on there.
01:02:00 That's not great.
01:02:02 But it's it's it's the muscle.
01:02:04 It's not like the bones or anything.
01:02:06 I just I probably need to just stretch if I just do that.
01:02:09 Because, you know, my runs are pussy shit.
01:02:11 They're half an hour and I take a like a bunch of breaks.
01:02:14 And I just like, I'm tired, I need to walk for a minute.
01:02:18 So whatever, I'm working on it.
01:02:20 But I'm going to follow this Bible.
01:02:21 He sent me some good shit, some good shit.
01:02:24 Anyway, there's your update, people.
01:02:25 I am a good to be a god.
01:02:27 By the time I get to Hawaii, I need to be hot.
01:02:29 That's my goal. So I'm losing weight.
01:02:31 Keto Keto Keto story.
01:02:34 I went to Thanksgiving.
01:02:37 Didn't break Keto.
01:02:38 Well, I kind of did a little bit in the sense.
01:02:41 I mean, I eat I eat turkey and I eat like, you know,
01:02:44 Brussels sprouts and, you know, green beans.
01:02:46 You know, I basically just ate turkey and greens.
01:02:48 And the only questionable things ate where I ate pumpkin seeds,
01:02:53 thinking that they were keto.
01:02:54 But I looked it up later and they actually you have some carbs.
01:02:57 And all they, you know, I didn't eat that many of them.
01:02:59 So whatever. OK, that wasn't great.
01:03:00 But it was and then there were these things that there were these weird
01:03:04 things that like aunt Sonny made or someone made them.
01:03:07 And they were made of almond butter rolled with like some kind of seed.
01:03:13 And they had like they had some dried cherries in them.
01:03:17 And they said a little bit of maple syrup.
01:03:20 And I had one or two of those.
01:03:21 This is so they had a little bit.
01:03:23 Are they good? Yeah, they weren't they weren't super sweet.
01:03:27 Like they weren't sweet like a dessert or anything.
01:03:29 So I felt like these can't be too bad.
01:03:32 Um, yeah, they were all right.
01:03:34 I mean, I just really like almond butter, really like I love nut butters.
01:03:38 All about those nut butters.
01:03:40 Hey, listen to me talking about food.
01:03:42 I'm like some kind of idiot talking about a dog.
01:03:45 What a fucking joke.
01:03:49 Hey, hippo, why don't you fucking celebrate Thanksgiving?
01:03:53 Oh, why don't you?
01:03:54 Why don't you? Why aren't you thankful for America?
01:03:58 Because I don't care.
01:04:00 I'm not that thankful.
01:04:01 What have you made for for the rest of us?
01:04:03 I've got peanut butter.
01:04:05 You ever heard of George Washington Carver?
01:04:07 Inventor a peanut butter.
01:04:08 Have you ever heard of Pokemon Go?
01:04:12 I ain't never eaten a peanut butter ever.
01:04:17 What about freedom? We invented that.
01:04:20 We invented both slavery and freedom.
01:04:25 We invented bald eagles.
01:04:26 We probably invented guns.
01:04:28 That might even be true.
01:04:29 I don't know.
01:04:33 Oh, right.
01:04:33 I saw I saw Princess Mona.
01:04:35 All right, please, please enlighten me because we do.
01:04:39 Obviously, we don't celebrate Thanksgiving
01:04:42 because it is an American tradition,
01:04:45 but I don't actually know what I like.
01:04:46 It's something to do with the Native American.
01:04:48 It's literally a celebration of genocide.
01:04:52 No, it's not exaggeration.
01:04:54 I mean, that's just how it's started.
01:04:56 It's an exaggeration, but I mean, yeah, it is.
01:04:59 I was arguing with Michelle about this.
01:05:01 What you celebrate on Thanksgiving
01:05:03 is specifically the event
01:05:05 where the Pilgrims and the Indians work together
01:05:08 and were harmonious.
01:05:09 You're not celebrating.
01:05:10 Look, yes, there were genocides later,
01:05:12 but you're not celebrating that.
01:05:13 It was like that first year or something
01:05:15 when the Indians or the Native Americans
01:05:18 shared with the Pilgrims so that they wouldn't start.
01:05:20 So it was like a thank you
01:05:23 in the form of giving food from one to the other for like, okay.
01:05:28 It was like coming together with people.
01:05:29 It was like a thanks for sharing harmony.
01:05:32 Nobody really cares about the Pilgrims, though.
01:05:34 It's mainly like a celebration of family
01:05:37 and hanging out with your loved ones.
01:05:39 Well, yeah, I know that from watching
01:05:42 all those funny American cartoons about families.
01:05:46 Is there a Charlie Brown Thanksgiving?
01:05:47 Yeah, there's gotta be, right?
01:05:49 Yes.
01:05:50 I think I've only seen the most offensive video version
01:05:54 of that and all other Charlie Brown specials.
01:05:57 Is it, suck my big black ass Charlie Brown?
01:06:01 Is that, that's actually the name too.
01:06:03 There is one that is called that.
01:06:05 I think it's the Valentine's Day.
01:06:07 I don't know.
01:06:09 You know, there's a thing about Thanksgiving.
01:06:12 It's like a small gripe
01:06:14 because it's not really a thing
01:06:15 that has ever been like pushed.
01:06:18 But I get this feeling that on social media,
01:06:20 people don't, you know, they say thanks.
01:06:23 They say a funny meme thanks
01:06:25 because it's Thanksgiving where they are.
01:06:27 And it's like, there's this slight implication
01:06:31 that you should be saying thanks in general.
01:06:34 Like it's not about Thanksgiving necessarily
01:06:36 on the internet.
01:06:37 It's just about saying thank you for stuff you have.
01:06:39 And I'm like, well, I mean, I know it's Thanksgiving
01:06:42 because everyone talks about it.
01:06:44 And I'm like, I'm thankful for things,
01:06:46 but I don't wanna be involved.
01:06:47 It's not my culture.
01:06:49 I don't know what to do.
01:06:50 It would be cultural appropriation.
01:06:52 It's not even about like cultural appropriation.
01:06:54 I just don't wanna be associated with this American,
01:06:57 this gross.
01:07:00 I mean, yeah, I don't think any,
01:07:02 I wouldn't expect outside cultures
01:07:04 to like recognize American holidays or anything.
01:07:06 Yeah, I mean, it's just hard to like, to look away.
01:07:11 Imagine like you don't celebrate Christmas.
01:07:14 And then every year there's a lot of Christmas stuff
01:07:18 on everything and you can't really get away from it.
01:07:21 And it's like, I don't really wanna do about this.
01:07:24 I understand why I have to commit acts of terror.
01:07:26 This cannot stand.
01:07:28 We have to cease this, this oppression and bullying.
01:07:31 It's not bullying, I don't feel bad about it.
01:07:33 I was just thinking about it.
01:07:36 Cause like I don't wanna say,
01:07:37 oh, I hate being thankful cause I don't.
01:07:39 I like being thankful, but it's just, it's not the time.
01:07:42 It's not yet the time.
01:07:44 Rattitude is a virtue in my humble opinion,
01:07:46 but yes, I understand your point.
01:07:47 It can be annoying.
01:07:50 By the way, I've opened up this Winder Stat shit,
01:07:52 it looks insane and it's pretty cool.
01:07:55 I don't get it, but I like it.
01:07:57 It's like hover over the squares
01:07:59 and you'll see at the bottom,
01:08:00 it'll show you like what files you're gonna get.
01:08:02 You click on, you click on the squares
01:08:04 and it will show you where that file is and what it is.
01:08:07 Let's link this in the show notes.
01:08:08 Let me, I'm gonna give people a screencap
01:08:10 of my breakdown of my drives.
01:08:12 Hopefully this doesn't contain secret information
01:08:14 that you shouldn't know.
01:08:15 But like if you look on the right there.
01:08:17 Best guy air videos from 2013
01:08:18 that still haven't been made yet.
01:08:20 Yeah, yeah, kind of.
01:08:23 Look at this, look at this.
01:08:24 What do you think those,
01:08:25 the biggest ones here are those blue squares
01:08:28 on the top right.
01:08:29 What do you think those are?
01:08:30 I mean, I would imagine that they're probably
01:08:32 like system files or something.
01:08:34 No, they're not.
01:08:35 They're actually, well, I'll just tell ya.
01:08:36 Those are the video files
01:08:39 specifically of the Final Fantasy lecture.
01:08:41 That's what those are.
01:08:42 Oh, okay.
01:08:44 Yeah, sure.
01:08:44 That's dope, that's dope as shit, dude.
01:08:48 Fuck.
01:08:49 VLC media files, 1.4 terabytes, yeah.
01:08:53 This is so good, cause okay,
01:08:55 one of these is Tom's lecture backup.
01:08:57 So like that lower blue square,
01:09:00 that's the backup file that I was holding on to
01:09:02 of Tom's lecture backup of the Guilty Gear.
01:09:04 I could probably fucking delete that at this point.
01:09:06 Don't need that anymore.
01:09:07 I think anyone needs that.
01:09:08 That'd be nice space to have.
01:09:10 It's cool, right?
01:09:10 It's good to see it visually.
01:09:12 It is so good.
01:09:13 It's great.
01:09:14 You completely forget like,
01:09:16 cause every time I render any video,
01:09:18 I usually hand break it,
01:09:20 which reduces the file size,
01:09:21 but often I forget to get rid of the original.
01:09:24 Yeah.
01:09:25 And seeing that is like,
01:09:26 oh, that huge thing,
01:09:26 that's the podcast from a few weeks ago
01:09:29 that I forgot to delete.
01:09:29 I have so sick.
01:09:31 I have so many files from old PCP episodes.
01:09:35 Me too, me too.
01:09:36 Do not need to be saved.
01:09:38 They definitely are not necessary anymore.
01:09:40 Yeah, I probably have like 50 or more gigs of that shit.
01:09:44 Yeah, this is Tom Black's program.
01:09:47 Yeah, this is the Black Friday deal.
01:09:48 Get this for zero money because it's free.
01:09:51 Instead of buying a new hard drive for Christmas,
01:09:53 get this and get rid of old shit.
01:09:55 You know what though?
01:09:56 On this subject,
01:09:58 one other factor of this is,
01:09:59 I am terrified of deleting source files
01:10:02 and then the project disappeared.
01:10:04 Like I've backed up like all best guy ever videos in places,
01:10:09 but almost like all their components.
01:10:11 What if I delete like my audio from a PCP episode
01:10:14 and then like the episode is taken down
01:10:17 and we need to re-render it or something?
01:10:19 I feel the same.
01:10:20 Yeah, I have the same thing.
01:10:21 Yeah, I have all that shit.
01:10:23 I've thought about that,
01:10:24 but I also think having the original files
01:10:29 is something that you would need
01:10:31 if you're like the Beatles
01:10:32 and you want to remaster the fucking Beatles albums.
01:10:36 A PCP episode, it's not really that important.
01:10:40 You're right on that.
01:10:41 You're right on that.
01:10:42 People have been able to download the MP3s forever.
01:10:45 That's true.
01:10:45 Things are saved in ways that...
01:10:47 Even if like our channel disappeared tomorrow,
01:10:49 like we would still have all the necessary...
01:10:52 Yeah, and also we'd also be still here.
01:10:55 We could just make new episodes.
01:10:56 We can download at our leisure at any point.
01:10:58 You know what though?
01:10:59 I'll give you the biggest example.
01:11:01 The most ancient thing I unearthed and like re-rendered
01:11:03 was at one point,
01:11:05 I can't remember what it was for,
01:11:07 but at one point,
01:11:08 because I still have all the original files
01:11:10 for best anime ever,
01:11:12 Gurrenlog in part two on my currently,
01:11:15 not my current machine, my old machine,
01:11:17 which is still hooked up.
01:11:18 Like I re-rendered a certain section.
01:11:21 Oh, you know what it was?
01:11:21 I had to re-render the personal fucking responsibility clip
01:11:26 for the Mia Maffova song that I did
01:11:33 for Mia Maffova last year,
01:11:36 because I wanted to render it without the backing audio track,
01:11:39 but I wanted to keep the visuals and stuff.
01:11:41 So that particular section,
01:11:42 I'm sure glad I still had that,
01:11:44 so I was able to reproduce it for the highest quality.
01:11:47 But like, even if I hadn't kept it,
01:11:49 all that would have changed
01:11:50 is that I would have used a clip
01:11:52 that just had the music in it
01:11:53 and then just kind of like fucked with the levels
01:11:55 to like lower it and shit.
01:11:57 Or you could have just re-recorded saying that.
01:11:59 I can't do that.
01:12:00 I need to preserve the quality of the originals.
01:12:03 Yeah, yeah, that would be like remastering fucking,
01:12:07 that would be like remastering a symphony of the night
01:12:10 and changing the dialogue or something.
01:12:12 He went there late in the year.
01:12:15 I don't know.
01:12:16 I feel like if you still have a microphone or a tablet,
01:12:20 you can recreate things,
01:12:22 like things get lost all the time.
01:12:23 I don't feel, I feel like...
01:12:27 Nate, I feel your same dedication
01:12:28 to preserving the original.
01:12:30 Thank you.
01:12:30 Thank you.
01:12:31 Yeah, I get it.
01:12:32 I get it.
01:12:33 Like I feel that way about the original versions
01:12:36 of certain video games where every digital version
01:12:39 sucks for some reason.
01:12:40 I don't know why.
01:12:43 All the remasters of Final Fantasy IX
01:12:45 have like really shitty background art now.
01:12:47 Yeah, I've seen those.
01:12:48 I want to buy the original just for that reason.
01:12:52 But like for videos on the internet,
01:12:54 like I mean specifically my videos on the internet,
01:12:58 I don't really care.
01:13:00 I'm sure people do care, but like if my channel gets deleted,
01:13:04 it would take a lot of my time and effort
01:13:07 to re-upload the files I have.
01:13:09 Yep.
01:13:10 I don't know whether I'd even try.
01:13:12 Damn, well, I mean,
01:13:13 I definitely don't feel that way personally.
01:13:17 But it would, I don't know.
01:13:18 Not everything that's on there
01:13:19 would I feel the need to resurrect probably,
01:13:21 though I'd want to.
01:13:22 I have zero backup of any of my video content
01:13:25 because I care that little about it.
01:13:27 Oh, God.
01:13:28 Oh, that's time for ya.
01:13:30 Hey, speaking of the lectures,
01:13:32 you mentioned the lectures looking at these files.
01:13:35 So here's something that I'm going through.
01:13:38 Here's something that I'm dealing with right now.
01:13:41 So over the last while,
01:13:44 I have been sort of talking to Laserbot,
01:13:48 a Camry Blankenship, the creator of Tales Gets Trolled.
01:13:54 And I friended him on Facebook
01:13:57 and like he knew he'd seen the lecture,
01:14:00 like he knew who I was more or less.
01:14:02 Yeah.
01:14:03 And we sort of start like casually talking,
01:14:05 like every few days we'd send a message
01:14:08 back and forth or whatever.
01:14:09 And I tell him like,
01:14:11 hey, it would be really cool to have you on our podcast.
01:14:14 And he was like, okay, cool.
01:14:17 Well, I don't have any internet right now.
01:14:19 I don't have a good microphone.
01:14:20 I don't have a good internet connection.
01:14:23 But when I do, I'm interested.
01:14:25 And I would like to talk about this new project
01:14:28 that I'm working on.
01:14:29 Well, it's not new.
01:14:30 He's remaking an old series
01:14:32 that he had on his YouTube channel.
01:14:34 I think I've mentioned it before.
01:14:35 It's called Micorat.
01:14:36 Right.
01:14:38 And I'm like, yeah, we can talk about Micorat.
01:14:42 Like I'd love to get you on the show.
01:14:44 I'm like, we can talk about whatever you're working on.
01:14:48 Just want to fucking chat and it would be super cool.
01:14:52 So that we proceed under that pretense
01:14:55 for maybe like a month or two.
01:14:58 And then fine, like I watch all of Micorat.
01:15:01 Like I tell him, like, you know, it's interesting,
01:15:03 you know, it's interesting to see
01:15:04 how you've evolved as of whatever, you know,
01:15:06 I want to know, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah, cool.
01:15:08 Let's talk about Micorat.
01:15:10 You know, I want to talk about
01:15:11 Tails Goods Troll and all that too.
01:15:12 Like, but yeah, we can get on, talk about Micorat.
01:15:15 We can promote the remake of Micorat.
01:15:18 And then, and then he's just like, oh yeah.
01:15:23 This was so infuriating to me.
01:15:25 He's like, well, I still don't have a good internet connection.
01:15:30 I still don't have a good microphone.
01:15:32 The best I can, the best I can do for you
01:15:35 is give you permission to talk about Micorat on.
01:15:40 And I'm like, I have not responded to this
01:15:42 because this is so infuriating because that's nothing.
01:15:45 What he's saying he can do for me is nothing.
01:15:48 I mean, you know, that's an acceptable amount
01:15:51 if he just doesn't want anything.
01:15:52 Oh, sure.
01:15:53 Okay, but then what the fuck have we been talking about?
01:15:56 He's like, he doesn't need to give me permission
01:16:00 to talk about his fucking YouTube series.
01:16:03 True, true.
01:16:05 I'm so fucking mad.
01:16:07 He fucking strung me along.
01:16:08 Well, that's understood.
01:16:09 For what?
01:16:10 You were the one doing all the work there
01:16:12 because we've been talking about getting him on possibly
01:16:14 or talking about his stuff for a while.
01:16:15 Well, look, I mean, if he didn't want to be on,
01:16:18 why didn't he just say, first of all,
01:16:19 I don't understand why not?
01:16:20 Because no one has ever heard of Micorat.
01:16:22 Okay, I think it comes down to this.
01:16:23 Sure, in the abstract, yeah, he'd like to be on.
01:16:27 I think it's just not that important to him,
01:16:29 which is fine, which is fine.
01:16:31 Oh, well fine.
01:16:32 And it would be nice if he had been clear with you on that.
01:16:33 Well then why did we even have this fucking exchange?
01:16:37 What was the point?
01:16:38 I'm so, I'm so annoyed.
01:16:41 I'm so annoyed about it.
01:16:42 I mean, the whole like internet thing,
01:16:44 like I understand people,
01:16:45 maybe they don't really have control over that,
01:16:47 but yeah, I mean, you got control over this other stuff.
01:16:49 I mean, if he didn't want to, then, you know,
01:16:52 it would have been nice to let you know a little sooner.
01:16:55 I don't know, I just,
01:16:56 I wonder if he even really has no internet connection
01:16:59 or if he just doesn't feel like doing this,
01:17:01 and that's just impossible.
01:17:02 How is he messaging you on Facebook?
01:17:04 Well, he said he didn't have a stable internet connection.
01:17:07 So like, whatever that.
01:17:08 I didn't have a stable internet connection.
01:17:09 I'm still doing the show today.
01:17:11 I would literally, if having no microphone,
01:17:13 if having not a good microphone is the problem,
01:17:16 I would literally buy him a microphone,
01:17:18 send him like a $50 microphone,
01:17:20 which would be good enough.
01:17:22 I feel this way a lot with people,
01:17:24 like I am a guy who when there's a thing I want to get done,
01:17:28 I find the points that are the issue,
01:17:30 we resolve them as quickly and efficiently as possible
01:17:33 and get to it, but that all hinges on the fact
01:17:35 that this is actually something people want to happen,
01:17:38 and maybe that's not the case.
01:17:39 Maybe that's not.
01:17:40 Well, yeah, and it's fine.
01:17:42 Just if he was not interested in doing this,
01:17:45 why did we proceed for all this time on the idea?
01:17:47 Here's the theory.
01:17:48 Here's the theory.
01:17:48 I don't think he's much of a podcaster.
01:17:50 Maybe he's nervous, and he just doesn't want to,
01:17:53 a lot of people wouldn't want to say that.
01:17:55 I'm not talking shit on the guy,
01:17:56 just some people are like that, so.
01:17:58 Well, I don't know.
01:17:59 I might give it another shot.
01:18:00 I might talk to him again and be like,
01:18:03 I don't know, I probably shouldn't give up.
01:18:04 Just level with him, just level with him here.
01:18:07 Yeah, yeah, I didn't respond to that.
01:18:10 This was a while ago, actually.
01:18:11 I didn't respond to that because I was very frustrated,
01:18:13 and I didn't want to come off as a jerk by saying,
01:18:16 okay, what you're saying you can do for me is nothing,
01:18:19 because that's what I wanted to say.
01:18:21 Because that is.
01:18:21 So instead you just put on the podcast
01:18:23 that you wanted to be on that he might listen to at some point.
01:18:26 His permission to talk about his work is nothing,
01:18:31 because that's something that I don't need permission to do.
01:18:34 That's true.
01:18:34 Because someone who already did a huge lecture
01:18:36 was sorry this whole thing in the first place,
01:18:38 clearly his permission is not necessary.
01:18:41 Yeah, but I don't know.
01:18:44 I mean, God, it'd be so cool, it'd be so funny.
01:18:47 It'd be so funny to have him on.
01:18:49 No one's here.
01:18:50 Because he's not anywhere.
01:18:52 There are no interviews with him or anything on YouTube
01:18:56 that I could find when I looked.
01:18:58 Give it an old college try there, Ben, one more time.
01:19:01 Yeah, I shouldn't give up.
01:19:02 I shouldn't give up just yet.
01:19:03 Look, I mean, if he doesn't want to do it, that's it.
01:19:07 That's fair enough.
01:19:10 There needs to be a bro talk here about,
01:19:12 let's get real behind this wheel, dog,
01:19:14 and just you want to be on this thing or not.
01:19:17 I want to talk about Micorat, right?
01:19:21 But I want to talk to you about it, sir.
01:19:24 I don't have that much to say about it on my own.
01:19:29 That's not the point here.
01:19:33 I feel you.
01:19:34 That's been on your mind.
01:19:35 That's been a thing you've been dealing with for a while.
01:19:38 A little bit, yeah.
01:19:39 I'm glad it's, yeah.
01:19:41 I was really looking forward to maybe getting Camry on.
01:19:45 I was a little bit crushed.
01:19:47 I was a little bit crestfallen when I got that message
01:19:49 being like, actually, oh no, it all comes tumbling down,
01:19:55 tumbling down, tumbling down.
01:19:58 I don't want to believe the man who made
01:20:01 Tails Gets Trolled isn't a man who executes
01:20:04 on his goals and dreams and ambitions.
01:20:07 So please prove us all wrong.
01:20:10 I will say the idea, okay, having watched Micorat,
01:20:15 the idea that he wants to remake it is totally baffled.
01:20:22 Maybe there's some core idea that he wants to really change.
01:20:27 That's what I want.
01:20:28 I want to know, are you just gonna re-remake it
01:20:30 or are you talking about a reboot with the same character?
01:20:34 Like that would make more sense
01:20:35 because I'm pretty sure that the characters in Micorat
01:20:38 are animalized versions of him and his brother
01:20:41 and their real life friends.
01:20:42 So like a reboot of it with the same characters
01:20:45 would make sense.
01:20:45 A remake would not make sense because I'm pretty sure
01:20:49 they just sort of like fucking rift,
01:20:51 sort of improv the whole thing and like, yeah.
01:20:55 We'll see, we need him on to answer these questions.
01:20:57 These are the questions I want to ask him.
01:20:59 Of course, of course.
01:21:01 Well, get on it, man.
01:21:04 Yeah, okay, I've been reinvigorated in my quest.
01:21:06 Excellent.
01:21:08 I had one thing.
01:21:10 I had just a thought, just a thought.
01:21:12 I was philosophizing, you know,
01:21:15 just riffing with my own brain.
01:21:17 What do you guys think about this?
01:21:19 This is my little philosophical thought
01:21:21 of the other day that I'm raising now.
01:21:23 I was thinking about why everybody is so upset,
01:21:29 specifically I was thinking about bullying.
01:21:30 I was thinking about bullying, but it applies to other stuff.
01:21:32 And I was like, the world hates bullying so much
01:21:37 and bullies specifically are vilified,
01:21:40 you know, understandably so.
01:21:42 But like, the whole world despises bullies intensely.
01:21:47 And it's because bullies are a very tangible thing, I think.
01:21:50 Like, okay, so you got a situation about a kid being bullied.
01:21:53 It's like, okay.
01:21:54 Everyone's been bullied in one form or another, right?
01:21:57 What I'm thinking about, I'm thinking about like,
01:21:59 how do we resolve like bullying?
01:22:00 Or you'll see how this extrapolates outward.
01:22:03 And I was thinking about like,
01:22:06 when you've got a situation where like,
01:22:07 let's say a weak little kid is being bullied
01:22:09 by like a larger kid,
01:22:10 like how do you fix this problem in the real world?
01:22:15 Because you got two, there's two options here.
01:22:17 One is that the outside world intervenes
01:22:20 and maybe like, separates them, punishes the bully,
01:22:26 does something like that.
01:22:27 And in some way, it stops the aggression from happening.
01:22:31 There's another way this situation can be resolved,
01:22:34 which is that the person who's bullied in some way,
01:22:38 like steps up or like proves that they won't be bullied.
01:22:41 They won't tolerate it.
01:22:42 You know, maybe fights back physically
01:22:44 or you know, whatever's appropriate for the situation.
01:22:47 And I was just, I was thinking about this equation.
01:22:49 And I'm like, man, the whole world just seems
01:22:53 like such a place where people want to do something.
01:22:57 The only-
01:22:57 To intervene?
01:22:58 Yes, yeah.
01:22:59 This interventionist mindset.
01:23:01 I think I see where you're going with this.
01:23:02 Yeah.
01:23:03 I was just thinking about how the,
01:23:04 the world has only, of that equation,
01:23:06 where there's two things that can change,
01:23:08 the entire world can only operate on one axis there.
01:23:12 And that is the interfere with the bully
01:23:15 and like stop them from doing the bad thing.
01:23:19 Yeah.
01:23:20 But it's, we have to admit that a big factor here,
01:23:24 a big way that this can change is for,
01:23:27 I mean, maybe like he gets like a talking with his dad.
01:23:30 He, you know, pulls up some thing from inside himself,
01:23:34 but the person who's being bullied,
01:23:36 they are the one, they change.
01:23:37 They change their mindset.
01:23:39 They change their, you know, internal mechanisms
01:23:43 or they just get like a really good lecture
01:23:45 from their dad or mom or whatever.
01:23:46 And then they're like, no, I'm not gonna be bullied anymore.
01:23:48 And then they fight back.
01:23:50 Cause most bullies, as I understand it,
01:23:52 they'll pick on the people who are like the weakest targets.
01:23:56 So if you just won't roll over, you know, theoretically,
01:23:58 and as long as they're, it's capable of some backlash,
01:24:00 like online, there's a different thing
01:24:02 where everyone's anonymous,
01:24:02 can't really fight back very well.
01:24:04 And I was just saying, so like people want,
01:24:07 the world wants to intervene and punish the bully,
01:24:10 but the better outcome really is that the bully,
01:24:15 the bully with two E's, you know,
01:24:17 like a trainee or an employee,
01:24:20 there's the bully and the bully.
01:24:21 Like the key blade.
01:24:24 So the bully E changes for the better, you know,
01:24:29 learns something and corrects the situation himself.
01:24:32 I mean, that can't always happen, right?
01:24:34 Some kids, like sometimes the size difference
01:24:37 might be so vast that like the small
01:24:38 and just can't fight back,
01:24:40 that he can't stand up to him in any meaningful way.
01:24:45 I'm sure there are situations like that.
01:24:46 I happily agree.
01:24:47 I mean, most bullies do not bully
01:24:50 unless they have a comfortable position of power
01:24:54 or anonymity on the internet,
01:24:56 which is a power in and of itself,
01:24:57 or in real life, like size or money
01:25:00 or like a job above the person.
01:25:01 Like bullies are fucking cowards.
01:25:03 They, in most cases, they only exist in situations
01:25:07 where the other person cannot fight back
01:25:10 because unfortunately, at some point,
01:25:13 a bunch of idiots got together
01:25:15 and decided that murder should be illegal.
01:25:18 And so there will never be any justice ever in the world
01:25:21 because you're not allowed to kill people.
01:25:23 So the world is fucked.
01:25:26 I hear what you're saying.
01:25:28 I hear what you're saying.
01:25:30 Like the point I wanted to make about this
01:25:33 was less about bullying specifically,
01:25:35 but it's that I feel like the whole world
01:25:38 is kind of possessed by,
01:25:41 like our actions are so guided by the fact
01:25:44 that we can only intervene on the one side.
01:25:48 We can't empower anyone
01:25:50 to change their internal mindset.
01:25:52 Even though that, I, like, let's say that this kid...
01:25:56 Is it like, you're risking victim shaming at that point?
01:26:01 Is that true?
01:26:02 And that people don't want to do that?
01:26:03 You can't make someone change their mindset,
01:26:07 but like, you know, others' actions
01:26:10 can lead to a change in attitude.
01:26:13 Like, by example, for example.
01:26:16 That's definitely true.
01:26:18 It's not like we can do nothing to change others' mindsets,
01:26:21 but we can't intervene directly in them.
01:26:24 It just often seems like those who fight back
01:26:28 are usually the ones punished.
01:26:31 You know, that, I suppose, I don't, you know...
01:26:34 And I think the way to fix that is that,
01:26:36 I think the way to fix that is,
01:26:38 just have no more laws.
01:26:40 Just like if someone is fucking with you,
01:26:43 you should be allowed to fucking cut their head off.
01:26:46 I don't think that's reasonable.
01:26:47 Who in their right mind?
01:26:49 Look, I don't know how much this happens.
01:26:50 Like, I don't know what kind of bullying is more common,
01:26:52 though they say bullying is on the rise,
01:26:54 but I think it's more like emotional
01:26:56 and like mental abuse and stuff.
01:26:58 I mean, that's the same.
01:26:59 Well, I'm talking, like, I guess that's true,
01:27:01 but if you've got a person who's, like,
01:27:05 you're a kid, you've got no friends,
01:27:06 like maybe you're a new kid at a school,
01:27:07 and like, there's a big kid,
01:27:08 and like, he's got like two or three friends
01:27:10 that always hang out with him,
01:27:10 and they just call you names every day,
01:27:13 and they call you names every single day.
01:27:14 Yeah, I saw Bart the General.
01:27:15 You saw what?
01:27:17 I saw Bart the General.
01:27:17 Right, right.
01:27:18 And like, if you like,
01:27:21 like, what happens when it comes to a head?
01:27:24 Like, you can't, I think this is more to Jesse's point.
01:27:26 Like, if you like, punch the kid one day
01:27:29 because you've just had enough,
01:27:31 I like, like, he never got physical,
01:27:34 and for some reason, well, okay, understandably,
01:27:36 it's harder to quantify like,
01:27:38 emotional abuse or like, mental bullying or whatever.
01:27:41 So like, you are the one who took it
01:27:43 to like an actual violent place,
01:27:45 so like, I feel like people are gonna be like,
01:27:47 oh, well, you're the real bad guy, thank you.
01:27:48 Yeah, I mean, society talks about it.
01:27:50 I mean, you should believe it.
01:27:51 I mean, you should believe it.
01:27:52 I mean, that kid is wrong.
01:27:53 It is wrong to attack someone.
01:27:54 No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
01:27:55 It is not, like, the thing that I hate
01:27:59 is that physical violence is held
01:28:02 as like, more dangerous, more bad
01:28:04 than like, emotional abuse.
01:28:06 It is, it is though.
01:28:08 No, no.
01:28:09 Yeah, okay.
01:28:10 It's because of the context of which people
01:28:12 like, take physical and mental abuse.
01:28:16 Like, you can't quantify it when it's emotional,
01:28:20 and because you can't quantify it,
01:28:22 you can't weigh the amount of physical abuse
01:28:24 against the amount of emotional abuse.
01:28:27 If somebody deserves to get punched in the face,
01:28:30 you can't like, you can't clarify that after the fact
01:28:34 and say, well, he did, you know, yell at you
01:28:36 as this specific amount, so one punch is okay.
01:28:39 Like, that never happens.
01:28:41 So like, everybody who is like,
01:28:44 the most annoying person in the world,
01:28:46 but they don't throw a punch,
01:28:47 can get away with that forever,
01:28:49 and somebody who throws a single punch is a villain.
01:28:52 Society says it's against bullying,
01:28:53 but the way that we, like you said, quantify like,
01:28:58 oh, because the person was violent,
01:29:00 that automatically is worse than the emotional abuse,
01:29:02 it's not, so like, you're almost not allowed
01:29:05 to stand up for yourself or be a man.
01:29:07 You're encouraged to be a rat motherfucker
01:29:09 and a coward and bully heroes.
01:29:11 There's like, if you think of like,
01:29:13 every TV show where like, somebody gets punched
01:29:16 and you're like, oh yeah, they deserve that.
01:29:19 Or like, you know, a Game of Thrones,
01:29:21 somebody dies and you're like, finally,
01:29:22 like, the things he's done, I mean,
01:29:25 in Game of Thrones, everyone kills everyone,
01:29:27 there's always physical violence,
01:29:28 but like, if somebody like, there was that moment
01:29:31 in the Harry Potter movie where Draco gets punched
01:29:33 by Hermione and everyone cheers at that,
01:29:35 they're like, oh yeah, cool, girl power,
01:29:38 and it's really cool and it's fucking sick, but like,
01:29:41 listen, it's like, Hermione didn't do a good thing,
01:29:45 but like, we all agree that, well,
01:29:47 we all generally agree that he kind of deserves that
01:29:50 and it's not like, she shouldn't be thrown
01:29:53 out of school for that.
01:29:55 Well, I mean, that's fiction, right?
01:29:59 In fiction, you can get punched in the face and it's fine.
01:30:01 No, the reason I was saying fiction is because
01:30:04 in fiction, you're reading it or watching it
01:30:07 and you can get a sense of like, how it feels
01:30:10 for the one person being bullied
01:30:12 because that's how like the narrative is like,
01:30:14 oh, this is the villain.
01:30:15 Yeah, you kind of can quantify the bullying in a book
01:30:17 where we can see their heads.
01:30:19 The only person who can quantify the amount
01:30:22 of emotional abuse in real life is the person being abused
01:30:25 and you know, an outlier and an onlooker
01:30:28 can't really gauge it perfectly.
01:30:32 Physical violence in the real world, you know,
01:30:36 despite how it looks in media is ugly and gross
01:30:40 and bad and like, in real life, a bully getting,
01:30:45 yeah, sure it is.
01:30:46 I don't know, I don't think that like,
01:30:49 I think the amount of emotional abuse someone would have
01:30:51 to inflict to deserve to get like physically struck
01:30:55 or injured is like, insane.
01:30:56 I mean, you know, like super hot,
01:30:59 like why is hurting someone's feelings
01:31:03 more okay than hurting someone's face?
01:31:06 Emotions aren't even real, dude.
01:31:07 Well, Bill Burr, I think summarized this well
01:31:11 in one of his little bits, which was like,
01:31:14 okay, you come home from work,
01:31:15 I don't know, you've been married to a woman
01:31:17 for like, I don't know, let's say 10 years,
01:31:19 I don't know, let's say you have kids
01:31:21 and you just find her like fucking the neighbor
01:31:25 and you're like, okay, like sure, it's not good
01:31:29 to like attack her or be violent to her, obviously,
01:31:31 would never condone it, but like,
01:31:33 you can understand why this is bad
01:31:36 and like what one's motivation would be
01:31:39 for like, you know, being physically violent here.
01:31:42 To want to be fit, yeah, sure.
01:31:45 In this case, it doesn't like, that's not justified,
01:31:46 it's not, you're gonna fix anything to attack a person.
01:31:49 And like, and like that's, that's,
01:31:52 I mean, God, like, I mean, that would be like a crime.
01:31:58 That's true.
01:31:58 And it would not be a crime.
01:32:00 It's not a crime what she did, on the other hand,
01:32:03 but it is bad and it is damaging in other ways.
01:32:08 And I understand we can't compare them,
01:32:09 they're kind of non-overlapping magisteria,
01:32:13 but I mean, yeah, I don't know, it's sort of similar.
01:32:17 It's sort of, you know, emotional abuse.
01:32:20 Yeah, yeah, it's sort of, I mean,
01:32:22 she's hurt, she's hurt this man emotionally,
01:32:26 so yeah, it's comparable there.
01:32:29 What are we, what are we?
01:32:31 You know what, what's the point we're driving at here?
01:32:33 I mean, there's a point is like,
01:32:35 do we want like physical violence to be okay,
01:32:38 or do we want like emotional abuse to be not okay
01:32:41 to an equivalent amount?
01:32:43 Like, it would be lovely if we could quantify
01:32:45 the emotional abuse and then deal out punishment properly.
01:32:48 Right now, what we're doing,
01:32:49 it just doesn't work, it's kind of impossible to do that.
01:32:52 We've already said, physical violence is out,
01:32:54 we can't do it.
01:32:55 And now, we're trying to do the same thing,
01:32:57 at least like Twitter with their,
01:32:58 like Twitter just made it a rule,
01:33:00 where you are, it is now a reportable and banable offense
01:33:05 if you like misgender or dead name someone,
01:33:07 and so that's like a trans thing.
01:33:09 So, like, so what they're,
01:33:11 I mean, the point of that policy is to stop you
01:33:13 from hurting people's feelings, and like, I get it.
01:33:14 God, I better fucking get my shit together
01:33:17 and start remembering that his name is Christine
01:33:19 Weston Chandler.
01:33:20 I mean, that he could report you.
01:33:22 It all comes down to like, we all are,
01:33:24 I'm sorry, she, whatever.
01:33:26 We all agreed that if a dog is barking at you,
01:33:30 you should be allowed to fucking punch it in the brain.
01:33:33 I mean, that's a, if a dog is emotionally abusing you
01:33:36 by annoying you enough,
01:33:38 then you should be allowed to be as violent as you want
01:33:40 and have a fucking dog meat sandwich for dinner.
01:33:44 I can't agree with that.
01:33:46 Now, you've found, yeah, okay, I do want to hurt dogs.
01:33:51 I do.
01:33:53 It's like, like, the reason you would go
01:33:55 to physical violence is not because you love to kill,
01:33:58 it is because that is the solution.
01:34:01 The dog will not bark as much if it sees you glaring at it
01:34:04 and punching it.
01:34:05 I mean, like, in theory, and when we'll have fantasies.
01:34:08 Dogs are the original bullies.
01:34:09 They fucking bark and bark,
01:34:11 and they act like they're tough shit, but they're cowards.
01:34:14 Well, like, a technical dog may or may not
01:34:16 fix the problem long-term.
01:34:17 Like, standing up to a bully, even physically,
01:34:20 that may in fact fix the problem long-term.
01:34:23 It might cause more violence.
01:34:24 You know, I don't know.
01:34:26 I mean, it might sometimes, yeah, it might scare them off.
01:34:28 It might create other problems, that's true.
01:34:30 It would make, like, okay, I don't think that you,
01:34:33 I don't think that you solve the bully problem
01:34:36 by, like, fighting the bully and hurting him
01:34:39 so that he's like, oh, if I fight this kid, I'll get hurt.
01:34:41 Like, I don't, I don't know.
01:34:43 That's a really clean narrative that you see in media.
01:34:45 You've changed the situation, but you haven't technically
01:34:46 solved it, it could go in other ways.
01:34:50 Yeah, like, it could just make him hate you more.
01:34:52 It could just make him even greater.
01:34:54 Yeah, it is, it is the cycle of violence.
01:34:56 I know that, like, yeah, in some cases,
01:34:58 it might fix the situation, but yeah, the cycle of violence.
01:35:00 Okay, you know what?
01:35:01 This is an interesting topic.
01:35:03 This actually was not my point at all.
01:35:05 And my main point was just that I would just,
01:35:10 I was thinking about bullying as an example of how,
01:35:13 like, outside people, we want to,
01:35:18 our only power here, if we, like,
01:35:20 see someone getting bullied,
01:35:22 all we can actually do to change the situation
01:35:25 is to, like, intervene personally
01:35:28 and, like, do something to, like, stop the bully.
01:35:30 We can't change what's going on inside the person
01:35:33 who's being bullied.
01:35:34 And I guess my only point is I think that's, like,
01:35:36 kind of an underserved and an underrepresented
01:35:40 important element that I just think deserves more
01:35:44 consider, I don't know what's to be done.
01:35:47 I guess it's kind of like, instead of just, like, shitty,
01:35:49 I could go on Twitter and, like, shit on Trump, I guess.
01:35:53 But, like, I just think a better,
01:35:54 even if Trump is the worst president, the worst person ever,
01:35:57 I just think a better thing to do is to, like,
01:35:59 think about, like, okay, guys, the world sucks,
01:36:01 here's what you can do to improve yourself.
01:36:04 And, like, these are the ways that no matter what happens,
01:36:06 you'll be in a better place to deal with it.
01:36:08 It's like giving someone a fish versus teaching them to fish.
01:36:10 Like, if you take the bully out of the equation,
01:36:14 the person who's getting bullied is still emitting
01:36:16 that kind of energy that attracts bullies,
01:36:18 and they're just gonna continue to get bullied.
01:36:21 Great point.
01:36:22 And it's like beating up their bully
01:36:25 instead of teaching them how to beat off bullies in general.
01:36:28 Beat them off, huh?
01:36:30 Or beat off your bully.
01:36:32 Guys, we found the solution.
01:36:33 Beat off your bullies.
01:36:35 It's what they're really looking for.
01:36:37 Love, love, not hate.
01:36:38 I pretty much love that.
01:36:40 I guess that pretty much sums it up.
01:36:42 Break the cycle of violence and beat off your bully.
01:36:44 With love, with love, guys, do it.
01:36:46 Yeah, I guess punching people is not the solution.
01:36:49 I just feel like the punishment for punching
01:36:54 and the punishment for emotional abuse
01:36:59 is skewed very far in harsh penalties for physical.
01:37:06 And I guess, after a certain point, there is a threshold.
01:37:10 There is a threshold beyond which it's like,
01:37:12 well, this guy's broken his leg.
01:37:14 That's fucked him up, and he's gonna break that leg again,
01:37:16 because the bone will never heal quite as strong
01:37:19 as the first time.
01:37:21 So that's irreparable damage.
01:37:24 That's kind of fucked up.
01:37:25 So there's a threshold beyond which physical violence
01:37:28 is always worse.
01:37:28 I mean, physical violence just aren't usually observable.
01:37:31 The small stuff is like, if a kid shoves another kid,
01:37:37 the kid who shoved should not get sent home,
01:37:40 and then the bully who was teasing him
01:37:43 should get off scot-free.
01:37:45 That's basically what I'm getting at.
01:37:46 Which is why I think they generally
01:37:47 write up both kids whenever there's a fight,
01:37:49 no matter who started it.
01:37:50 That's why I got sent home, and suspended
01:37:53 for getting punched in the face.
01:37:55 Classic tale.
01:37:56 You shouldn't have had such a punchable face their time.
01:37:59 It's your one mistake.
01:38:01 Big and ugly, and I was just asking for it.
01:38:05 What can I say?
01:38:06 It's right.
01:38:06 Teachers had been just clamoring for an excuse
01:38:09 to write you a pink slip and send you home today.
01:38:12 And he got punched perfect.
01:38:14 Now we can insult him as an injury.
01:38:16 I don't know.
01:38:16 I didn't have to do homework for three days.
01:38:18 It was fine.
01:38:19 That was a good decision.
01:38:20 I was glad I was able to generally articulate the point.
01:38:22 That's an interesting topic.
01:38:23 I just think the problem is that just to cap it off
01:38:27 is that we, as a society, do undervalue or don't put
01:38:33 enough weight on mental stress and emotional abuse.
01:38:37 But the reason we don't, and the reason it's such a problem,
01:38:40 is that we're all emotionally weak,
01:38:41 and our culture makes us emotionally weak.
01:38:44 And so the way to fix emotional bullying
01:38:49 is to strengthen everybody, to not be such a little bitch,
01:38:53 because we're all little bitches when it comes to our fee
01:38:56 fees.
01:38:56 And that's bullshit.
01:38:57 And we regularly, based on the least resilient people.
01:39:01 I don't even know how we would possibly do that.
01:39:02 Yeah, yeah, because I mean, and of course we do,
01:39:05 because it makes sense.
01:39:06 Those are the people who need protection.
01:39:07 But then the whole system caters to them,
01:39:10 and is that necessarily?
01:39:12 Then we get all this padding on everything.
01:39:14 And so people don't have as much opportunity
01:39:16 to build up resilience.
01:39:19 I heard a summary that apparently this
01:39:21 is true, that in the wake of Trump getting elected,
01:39:26 there were actually a large number of millennials suffering.
01:39:30 This is not a joke, actual, real symptoms of PTSD,
01:39:34 just from Trump getting elected.
01:39:36 I think I know some of them.
01:39:38 Oh yeah?
01:39:38 And I mean, you look at the world, it's like, OK,
01:39:41 things seem OK.
01:39:42 Like I know people who have mentally gone downhill
01:39:47 since the election of Trump.
01:39:49 I was actually assaulted by one of those people.
01:39:51 But I guess I shouldn't think of it.
01:39:53 Oh yeah, the subject of what?
01:39:54 Oh, that was when you were like, you
01:39:55 had a joke where Trump's a party.
01:39:57 On the subject of what happens when you stand up to bullying,
01:40:02 yeah, I went to a costume party, a Halloween party,
01:40:05 like around the time that it was 2016.
01:40:08 And I didn't really have a costume.
01:40:10 So I thought, oh, it'd be funny if I
01:40:12 went as a Trump guy, right?
01:40:13 So I put on the Make America a Great Again hat,
01:40:17 and I put on a denim jacket.
01:40:19 And I went around like, I'm a Trump guy.
01:40:21 Well, it was a party with a lot of young, early 20s women
01:40:27 who don't like the Trumper.
01:40:30 So a lot of them.
01:40:32 They can't bump to that Trump.
01:40:33 I got a lot of nasty looks.
01:40:35 And I got a lot of people yelling at me
01:40:37 to fuck off just for being there.
01:40:40 This one girl who was very drunk.
01:40:42 You would have gotten less attacked
01:40:44 if you'd literally gone to this costume party as a Nazi.
01:40:46 You would have been more beloved.
01:40:48 There was this one drunk girl who came up to me
01:40:51 and started pushing me and putting her hands on me
01:40:54 and hitting me and trying to scratch at me.
01:40:57 And I kept trying to push her off of me.
01:41:01 And I finally said, if you put your hands on me one more time,
01:41:05 I'm going to hit you back.
01:41:08 And she is like, oh, yeah, fucking.
01:41:10 And to test me, she does it again.
01:41:13 And I just fucking, I fucking hit her.
01:41:17 And you would have thought that I shot a puppy.
01:41:21 Like the entire party stops.
01:41:23 Everyone, it instantly became the most chaos I've ever seen.
01:41:27 The whole party descended on me.
01:41:29 Like three guys bum rushed me out of nowhere.
01:41:33 And like, I suddenly, I'm fighting three guys,
01:41:36 like a fucking Jackie Chan movie.
01:41:38 And the whole time that I'm fighting three guys,
01:41:40 she's also like pulling my hair
01:41:42 because I had long hair back then.
01:41:43 She's pulling my hair.
01:41:44 She's scratching me, screaming at me.
01:41:46 All these guys who like don't know what happened at all.
01:41:48 They don't know the situation.
01:41:50 All they know is that.
01:41:52 All they saw was that a girl got hit by a guy
01:41:55 and they were like, well, this will be a fucking night.
01:41:56 So they got a fucking white night and they got to come up
01:41:59 and I fucking, I fucking, there was,
01:42:02 I'm proud of this though.
01:42:03 Cause there was one guy who like dressed as,
01:42:06 there's this guy who like,
01:42:07 I think runs for president every year.
01:42:08 One of those crazy homeless people who like wears a boot
01:42:10 on his head.
01:42:11 I don't remember his name,
01:42:12 but his thing is that he wears a boot on his head.
01:42:14 And there was like a guy dressed up on a ass
01:42:16 and with a fake beard and a boot on his head.
01:42:18 And like, at some point in the fracas,
01:42:20 in the melee, in the brawl,
01:42:21 in the other fucking Smash Brothers words,
01:42:23 I fucking, at some point I threw a perfect uppercut.
01:42:28 And it was like, it was like a shuriyuken that,
01:42:31 and like I connected with this guy.
01:42:33 I was gonna say, did you say shuriyuken?
01:42:34 I knocked his fucking boot off his head
01:42:37 and his fucking, his fake, his fake beard went flying one way.
01:42:40 The boot flew the other way.
01:42:42 He like, he like went up in the air and fucking,
01:42:45 like I'm not saying that I'm like,
01:42:47 that I killed all three guys,
01:42:48 but I fucking connected with that uppercut
01:42:50 and that fucking boot motherfucker went flying.
01:42:53 And it was beautiful.
01:42:55 But yeah, I like, it was literally,
01:42:57 I started a riot by wearing a costume to a Halloween party.
01:43:01 I mean, I can see,
01:43:02 I can see how every step of that story progress
01:43:06 and why it progressed the way it did.
01:43:08 Here's the frustrating thing.
01:43:10 Here's what, here's why like,
01:43:13 you like, yeah, you told that girl like,
01:43:14 don't assault me or I'm gonna hit you.
01:43:16 She assaulted you and you hit her.
01:43:17 I don't think that was wrong.
01:43:19 But here's the frustrating part
01:43:21 and why the cycle of violence is a problem.
01:43:23 Like, justified or not,
01:43:25 you know that girl's story is.
01:43:27 Oh yeah.
01:43:27 A crazy MAGA Trump guy hit me at a possible.
01:43:29 Oh yeah, absolutely.
01:43:30 But you know what?
01:43:31 And that's the story she'll repeat for the rest of her life.
01:43:33 You know what makes it worth it though,
01:43:34 is that I heard the next morning
01:43:37 from my friend who's house it was at the party
01:43:39 that she drove home drunk and crashed her car.
01:43:43 Holy fuck.
01:43:44 So.
01:43:45 Not into any innocent people.
01:43:47 No, just into like a tree or a pole or something.
01:43:49 But yeah, fuck her.
01:43:51 Oh, but you fucking know.
01:43:53 This was only due to the severe concussion
01:43:56 delivered upon her by a vicious Trump supporter.
01:43:59 This was due to the PTSD,
01:44:00 the flash that you gave her flashbacks.
01:44:04 And she was like, she had to jump in that car and drive
01:44:07 because Charlie was in the fucking tree.
01:44:11 She had to escape.
01:44:12 There was an agent orange was closing in on her.
01:44:14 She had to fucking escape the car.
01:44:15 The true agent orange himself.
01:44:17 Oh my God.
01:44:18 It was full.
01:44:20 Oh my God.
01:44:21 Yeah, she wrecked her car that night
01:44:22 and like ran away from the accident
01:44:24 and got picked up by the police later and got arrested.
01:44:26 So I win, I guess.
01:44:28 I guess at the end of the day.
01:44:30 She couldn't trump the stump
01:44:32 as she fucking ran into a tree.
01:44:34 It's true.
01:44:35 Oh fuck.
01:44:36 It's just, it's so,
01:44:38 there's no way to fix this problem
01:44:41 that people just read into situations
01:44:43 what they want to get out of it.
01:44:45 That's just what we all do and I don't know.
01:44:47 I just really like the imagery
01:44:50 of like a brawl at a Halloween party.
01:44:53 Yeah.
01:44:53 Like the scary people.
01:44:54 Yeah, all the ghosts and ghouls come out.
01:44:56 I was fighting off goblins.
01:44:59 Like that would be in like a Jackie Chan movie
01:45:02 or in some like hilarious movie.
01:45:02 Or like a Ninja Turtles movie.
01:45:04 Yeah.
01:45:05 You get the Casey Jones mask
01:45:06 and you got all the ninjas coming out.
01:45:08 You have like Freddy versus Jason
01:45:10 but they're like shitty Halloween costume versions
01:45:13 or something, you know.
01:45:14 Jason's costume is a shitty Halloween costume already
01:45:17 but fair point, fair point.
01:45:18 That's true.
01:45:19 That's true.
01:45:20 Damn, that was a good story.
01:45:22 All right, well good.
01:45:23 Yeah.
01:45:24 Let's, let's.
01:45:25 Don't know what the answer is though.
01:45:26 There is no answer.
01:45:26 Don't know if we've, don't know if we've learned them.
01:45:28 I think we didn't find an answer.
01:45:30 It's kind of a funny story to fix.
01:45:33 That's the most, that's the best we can do.
01:45:35 You can't really fix human nature.
01:45:37 People are gonna want to punch each other.
01:45:39 There's a reason why philosophers have not cracked this code
01:45:42 over the, you know, thousands of years
01:45:43 of human civilization.
01:45:44 Cause it comes down to human fucking nature
01:45:47 as long as that's the same.
01:45:48 As long as people are selfish, willfully ignorant
01:45:52 and, you know, form teams, which we all do
01:45:54 and basically always will do,
01:45:57 this will continue to be a problem.
01:45:58 And social media has just made it that much easier.
01:46:01 So, you know, there's no fix in it.
01:46:03 It's unfortunate cause like I like being in a team
01:46:06 as in like people I like and like people
01:46:08 who I respect and trust.
01:46:10 Like, like I like being in that the team of people I like.
01:46:13 But the reason I like that is because there's a possibility
01:46:17 that there are people who are, you know,
01:46:19 like if we were all robots,
01:46:21 we would all be self-sufficient,
01:46:23 but we would have no friends.
01:46:25 And it would be like, eh, you know, as a human,
01:46:28 I kind of don't want to live in a world where I'm by myself.
01:46:31 Yeah, it sucks.
01:46:32 But it sucks.
01:46:33 Can't help that.
01:46:34 Oh, just as an addendum,
01:46:35 I looked up to clarify the name of the costume
01:46:39 the guy was wearing with the boot on his head.
01:46:41 The guy's name, so everyone knows
01:46:44 I'm not making this story up.
01:46:45 Is it Slavo, is it Slavo?
01:46:48 It's, no, his name is Vermin Supreme.
01:46:53 Oh, oh yeah, yeah, Vermin Supreme.
01:46:55 That's the guy who's dressed up as a doctor.
01:46:56 Yeah, I have heard of that.
01:46:57 Yeah.
01:46:58 I'm very proud of myself.
01:47:00 Oh, that's fucking sick.
01:47:02 All right, well, how about we get
01:47:04 to those fucking voicemails now, gentlemen?
01:47:06 Yeah, I think it's about time.
01:47:07 All right, let's do it.
01:47:08 We're closing in on two hours.
01:47:09 Okay, let's see.
01:47:11 How many do we have today?
01:47:12 We got 10, we got 10 here.
01:47:13 Oh, I know, I know.
01:47:16 Oh, and after the whole thing went down,
01:47:18 one of the guys who had jumped me in that fucking fracas
01:47:23 after it was all dying down
01:47:25 and everyone was trying to separate everyone
01:47:27 and it was one of the guys did that insufferable thing
01:47:32 that guys do where after a fight,
01:47:34 they try to shake hands and apologize
01:47:37 and I was having none of it.
01:47:39 I fucking looked at that guy
01:47:40 the same way I looked at that fucking dog.
01:47:42 I just gave him the look.
01:47:44 I gave him that, that Enlip G look of.
01:47:47 The conqueror's eyes.
01:47:48 Yeah, you should take your fucking hand out
01:47:50 to shake it, fuck you, buddy.
01:47:51 And I'd fucking said, fuck you and suck my dick
01:47:54 and I walked away and there you go.
01:47:58 And he sat there with his hand out
01:48:00 like a fucking goofball.
01:48:02 Oh yeah, I'm surprised it ended.
01:48:05 I mean, so relatively amicably,
01:48:07 like people were still able to like shake hands
01:48:09 instead of like the whole thing
01:48:10 just floating off and floating out.
01:48:11 Well, they tried, but I didn't shake their fucking hands.
01:48:13 Right, they tried to make it amicable,
01:48:15 but I was like oh hell no.
01:48:16 The only thing to do with me
01:48:17 is to fucking flee from this fracas and never return.
01:48:19 Does that mean they recognize their mistake at the end?
01:48:23 I think it's just like a self-defense mechanism.
01:48:26 Like they wanna be able to say,
01:48:28 well, I try, you know, I was a good guy at the end.
01:48:29 I don't know if they recognize their mistake
01:48:31 or if they just because my fucking boy,
01:48:34 butt chugger Cody LaRue came out
01:48:36 and fucking yelled at him because it was his house.
01:48:38 Oh, okay.
01:48:39 So, you know, you don't wanna incur the wrath
01:48:41 of the fucking butt chug, man.
01:48:43 He'll,
01:48:44 No sir.
01:48:46 He'll dunk your fucking head in the butt juice.
01:48:48 And there was a tub of butt juice at the party.
01:48:51 He fucking, it was one of those like when people make
01:48:54 the big alcohol concoctions with the fruit in them,
01:48:57 but it was labeled butt juice.
01:48:59 He'll fucking dunk it in there.
01:49:01 It's fucking sick.
01:49:02 I'm sorry, I just keep uncovering layers
01:49:04 to this fucking story.
01:49:05 No, it's good, this is good.
01:49:06 This is a tasty onion.
01:49:08 I just want more layers.
01:49:10 All right, let's visit in with our friend,
01:49:13 Racist Forest Gump.
01:49:15 Once again today,
01:49:16 he's got another message for us that we need to hear.
01:49:18 He's becoming a member.
01:49:19 Sure.
01:49:20 Yeah, basically.
01:49:21 Jenae.
01:49:22 Jenae.
01:49:24 I got a pile of Jenae.
01:49:27 Oh no.
01:49:27 What is it, Forest?
01:49:28 What is it?
01:49:30 Jenae.
01:49:31 The SJW Neo-Marx's, they found it.
01:49:36 What did they find?
01:49:37 What did they find, Forest?
01:49:40 They found, they doxxed me, Jenae.
01:49:44 They did, but they took my balls.
01:49:46 I was a racist.
01:49:49 They got it coming after me, Jenae.
01:49:52 No, Forest, that's horrible.
01:49:54 What are you gonna do?
01:49:56 I don't know, Jenae.
01:49:57 They outside my door with pitchforks.
01:50:00 With pitchforks.
01:50:02 What am I gonna do, Jenae?
01:50:04 You gotta run, Forest.
01:50:07 Run, Forest, run!
01:50:09 I just love hearing from racist Forest Gump
01:50:13 so much every week.
01:50:14 That is the perfect end to that arc.
01:50:19 He began the cycle a while ago,
01:50:21 but he wasn't prepared to finish it.
01:50:23 What's the, oh, fuckin', what's the Twitter alternative?
01:50:27 Gab.
01:50:28 People that could ban from Twitter.
01:50:29 Yeah, yeah, he better make a Gab account.
01:50:31 That's the only way, it's the only way.
01:50:35 Poor racist Forest Gump.
01:50:37 He didn't do nothing wrong, except for the racism.
01:50:40 Except for being racist, yeah.
01:50:43 All right, next call, we got...
01:50:44 He's defining characteristics.
01:50:47 The PCP Medical Consultant is calling in
01:50:51 with some updates for us.
01:50:54 Tell us how we're working.
01:50:54 Okay, look, look.
01:50:56 As a fuckin' six year medical student
01:50:59 listening to this podcast, I'm so fuckin' angry.
01:51:03 In episode 134, you are saying that
01:51:07 the goldbladder secretes bile.
01:51:10 It stores bile, fuckin' ass idiots.
01:51:14 Sorry, I'm sorry.
01:51:16 It stores bile.
01:51:17 Doesn't digest fiber.
01:51:19 Fiber is indigestible.
01:51:20 Fuck.
01:51:21 Oh my God.
01:51:22 I knew that.
01:51:23 Please, you are the reason people are dying.
01:51:29 Okay, okay.
01:51:30 I'm pretty sure that I corrected the appendix thing,
01:51:33 but yeah, I misspoke about the gallbladder.
01:51:37 I'm sorry.
01:51:37 That's where the pee is stored, as I recall.
01:51:40 Yeah, yeah, yeah, in the test,
01:51:41 the gallbladder's in the testicle,
01:51:43 and it stores the pee.
01:51:44 It's filled with piss.
01:51:46 That's why women...
01:51:47 Where does bile come from?
01:51:48 Okay, the gallbladder stores bile.
01:51:50 I don't know.
01:51:51 Where does the bile come from?
01:51:51 It's made in China.
01:51:52 It's the pancreas.
01:51:54 Is it the spleen?
01:51:56 It might be the spleen, actually.
01:51:57 It's the brain.
01:51:58 It's gonna come back, even matter.
01:51:59 Oh, it's all...
01:52:01 The brain is full of bile.
01:52:03 My brain is where you get all the skeleton from.
01:52:06 Perception is reality,
01:52:07 so it all comes from the brain anyway.
01:52:10 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true.
01:52:11 Okay.
01:52:13 All right, well, we're the reason people are dying.
01:52:14 Sorry about that, dude.
01:52:15 Thanks for calling in.
01:52:16 Let us know if we fuck anything else up.
01:52:18 Okay.
01:52:18 Yeah.
01:52:19 We're the reason people are dying.
01:52:21 If it wasn't for us, death would be a non-issue.
01:52:23 That's an tagline for the show,
01:52:24 the Procrastinators podcast,
01:52:26 where the reason people are dying.
01:52:29 Dude, that's really good.
01:52:31 Okay, here's our next call.
01:52:33 This is from Shraft Vortex.
01:52:35 Shraft Vortex.
01:52:38 Oh, yeah, sure.
01:52:39 I've been killing Rowdy's with him.
01:52:41 Oh, really?
01:52:42 Oh, you know?
01:52:43 Once in a while.
01:52:44 Okay, I didn't know.
01:52:45 Okay, let's see what he's got.
01:52:46 Hey, guys, just wanted to ask real quick.
01:52:47 Do you think that everyday situations
01:52:50 have been made to be political,
01:52:52 or do you think that they have always been
01:52:54 and are just talked about in that way way more often now?
01:52:57 Cool.
01:52:58 Discuss.
01:53:00 That's it.
01:53:01 I don't like this question,
01:53:02 because it's too big.
01:53:03 Wait, is he asking why everything is so political?
01:53:05 Though it is?
01:53:06 Yeah, yeah.
01:53:07 Because I said this on one,
01:53:09 but I wasn't recording because I was an idiot,
01:53:11 so I guess I'll reiterate the point that I made the last time
01:53:14 because I thought it was a good point.
01:53:16 I figured out why everything is so fucking political
01:53:20 and horrific nowadays, why you can't get away from it,
01:53:23 why everyone's sucked into the one side versus the other.
01:53:29 It's because you know that fucking guy on your Facebook,
01:53:36 you guys heard this story,
01:53:37 but pretend you're hearing this for the first time.
01:53:39 I'm hearing it for the first time.
01:53:40 You know that guy.
01:53:41 I wasn't listening.
01:53:42 On everyone's friend's list,
01:53:43 who's always posting like I'm depressed,
01:53:45 please someone hang out with me,
01:53:47 I hate my life and I hate myself,
01:53:48 and I'm the person who's always having
01:53:50 like a pity party for themselves on Facebook.
01:53:52 That's me, that's me you're talking about.
01:53:54 Everybody knows that person,
01:53:56 and we feel bad for him for a while,
01:53:58 but nobody wants to be that person.
01:54:00 Nobody wants to go on Facebook all the time
01:54:03 and make themselves into an object of pity
01:54:05 by saying how bad their life is, right?
01:54:08 But everyone feels that way,
01:54:11 and everyone wants, deep down,
01:54:14 everyone wants to go on Facebook
01:54:16 and just let it loose.
01:54:18 I've got problems and here are my problems
01:54:20 and I'm lonely and I'm sad and I'm heartbroken
01:54:22 and I'm miserable.
01:54:23 Everyone wants to do that,
01:54:25 but we're all kind of like we have that level of shame
01:54:27 where we don't do it.
01:54:28 So people all day are going around
01:54:31 with this thing inside them
01:54:32 that they just want to express their pain,
01:54:35 but they're embarrassed to.
01:54:36 So they have to latch on to some other way
01:54:40 to express their discontent.
01:54:42 And the most acceptable way to do it
01:54:44 is to latch on to politics
01:54:47 and make all of your problems
01:54:49 because of the opposing team.
01:54:51 So that's why all anyone talks about anymore
01:54:54 is politics and complaining and fighting about politics
01:54:57 because they're just sad.
01:54:58 I do think that you're onto something.
01:55:02 Yeah, it's become maybe a little more in vogue
01:55:07 to be political, I guess,
01:55:09 and a little more socially acceptable
01:55:11 and commonplace to talk about these things publicly.
01:55:13 However, I think that the issues that are politicized
01:55:17 were always political.
01:55:20 It just, they weren't as discussed in the same way.
01:55:22 Is it literally because like, you know,
01:55:25 millennial people who grew up with the internet
01:55:28 as it started are like now adults
01:55:31 and people just use the internet more?
01:55:34 That definitely adds to it, I think.
01:55:36 Yeah, because like...
01:55:38 Like now it's so easy to bump the ideologies
01:55:41 with different people because of Twitter and stuff.
01:55:43 Yeah, like it's weird to think
01:55:46 because internet has already, you know,
01:55:48 it's been around for a while
01:55:49 and people have been on it talking about political stuff
01:55:52 for a while, but it does feel like in recent years
01:55:56 that it's just more.
01:55:57 And I guess it could just be that Trump was a big upset,
01:56:02 like, oh, who saw that coming?
01:56:05 Like it was, it's not just a new politician
01:56:07 doing the same old shit.
01:56:08 It's someone that's like,
01:56:10 you get good boy points for saying the politicians are bad
01:56:15 and then suddenly once you get good boy points
01:56:17 for saying the politicians are bad,
01:56:18 now you want to talk about politics more.
01:56:21 Once you get one good boy point, it's a slippery slope.
01:56:24 You just crave more and more.
01:56:25 It's just way easier and way less vulnerable
01:56:28 to be outraged about like what the president is doing
01:56:31 or what insert political group here is doing
01:56:33 than it is to be like openly sad and asking for comfort
01:56:37 and help because your life sucks.
01:56:39 Yeah, yeah.
01:56:40 There's something to that.
01:56:41 Yeah, it's a good point.
01:56:43 Yeah, if you can just add your personal issues
01:56:46 onto political problems
01:56:47 and then you can talk about it guilt-free.
01:56:49 Yeah, exactly.
01:56:50 This is why.
01:56:52 And that's the other thing, like why I can't really,
01:56:55 why I, like people use the term centrist a lot.
01:56:58 I don't really believe that that's a thing.
01:57:00 I think it's kind of a straw man.
01:57:03 Like people's idea of like a person who is neutral,
01:57:07 I guess, is that they just think that like,
01:57:10 both sides are wrong about everything.
01:57:12 I don't think that at all.
01:57:14 I think that both sides are right about most things.
01:57:17 I think that every, and this is the reason
01:57:20 why I don't get invested too much in political issues
01:57:23 is because everyone feels the way they do for a reason.
01:57:27 Something fucking happened to them.
01:57:30 When someone is outraged about like Trump
01:57:34 and is saying that like all Trump supporters
01:57:36 must be rapists or like misogynists,
01:57:40 like yeah, you can say that that person is crazy,
01:57:43 but something fucking happened to that person,
01:57:47 to make them feel that way.
01:57:48 So you-
01:57:49 Some crazy guy punched her for no reason
01:57:52 in the Halloween party.
01:57:55 Like during the Brett Kavanaugh thing,
01:57:57 like I was pretty not into how it seemed like
01:58:01 there were a lot of pretty baseless accusations
01:58:04 being made, but like, of course people
01:58:07 who like had any kind of personal experience
01:58:09 are gonna be like, no, no, no, no, no, no,
01:58:10 we're gonna fucking air on the side of caution,
01:58:12 just as there's even a fucking hint
01:58:15 that there was some impropriety.
01:58:17 No, this man is clearly not, you know, and then-
01:58:20 Yeah, like I get it, like no issue is really
01:58:22 about the issue, like the Kavanaugh thing.
01:58:25 I don't even know what it is or what it is.
01:58:27 I'm assuming he like did something at a party,
01:58:29 like raped someone, I don't fucking know.
01:58:30 That's the accusation, yeah.
01:58:32 Like the issue that people are arguing about
01:58:35 isn't really about him, that guy,
01:58:37 it's about there's people who have been sexually assaulted,
01:58:42 who feel one way and there's people
01:58:44 who have been falsely accused of being like sexual predators
01:58:48 who feel another way and like they're arguing
01:58:50 from their own experiences.
01:58:52 The guy, Kavanaugh, doesn't fucking matter,
01:58:54 he's nobody, but people are saying,
01:58:56 this happened to me, well this happened to me,
01:58:58 so fuck you and we have to fight about it.
01:59:01 Yeah, and then everyone else falls into like,
01:59:03 oh, I hope that doesn't happen to me or like,
01:59:05 I'm afraid that might happen to me
01:59:06 and then they fall on one side of the thing.
01:59:08 So it's not both sides are wrong,
01:59:09 it's both sides are right, the world is really fucked up
01:59:12 and it's fucked up in so many like interconnected,
01:59:16 convoluted, criss-crossing ways
01:59:18 that like everybody can be right
01:59:21 in how they perceive the problems in our society.
01:59:24 Because it's all happening,
01:59:26 all the bad stuff is happening all the time to everyone,
01:59:28 every bad thing you could possibly imagine
01:59:31 it's happening to everyone.
01:59:33 That's true, that's what I said before,
01:59:35 like to every side, the other side is,
01:59:38 they're correctly being identified as evil
01:59:42 because they don't share their values
01:59:43 which makes them evil in their mind
01:59:45 and that's it, you can't argue with that, that's there.
01:59:48 I'm interested in like, why happy things,
01:59:53 like good things happening is just uninteresting as news.
01:59:58 Because anger is a stronger, like it's our,
02:00:00 there was a thing about how anger is the most vulnerable.
02:00:02 Yeah, but why is it a stronger?
02:00:03 Why is anger stronger?
02:00:05 Disasters happen fast, like good things happen gradually.
02:00:07 I think the reason why Gib
02:00:09 ties into probably like biology really,
02:00:11 cause like, if there's something good happens
02:00:14 to like your tribe of like a hundred Neanderthals,
02:00:17 like, oh good, my son was born, hooray,
02:00:20 whereas, oh no, we're being invaded by the enemy,
02:00:24 we're all going to be wiped out,
02:00:25 like that's gonna trigger like a stronger.
02:00:27 We need to be, yeah.
02:00:30 That's just a guess.
02:00:30 I agree with what Ben said too,
02:00:32 that was a good point about how like,
02:00:34 bad things happen fast and good things happen gradually.
02:00:36 Like there's no nice equivalent of a school shooting
02:00:41 where like someone comes into school in a trench coat
02:00:43 and starts hugging everybody, like that never happens.
02:00:46 That's not everything that's true.
02:00:47 Yeah, I mean, all the positive news stories you read,
02:00:53 like they're either boring, like, oh yeah,
02:00:55 that bill that was in town hall election, it got passed,
02:01:00 we did it, like that's boring.
02:01:02 Like you never see a volcano.
02:01:03 Or it's something dumb, like, oh hey,
02:01:05 the fucking Christmas parades in town,
02:01:08 and Santa this year is-
02:01:09 Oh, there's a cat who's a mayor of a town,
02:01:11 like it's next to you, right?
02:01:12 You never see a volcano erupt with doughnut sprinkles
02:01:15 and confetti.
02:01:16 Yeah, yeah, oh shit.
02:01:20 It's always lava, for some fucked up reason,
02:01:22 I don't know why.
02:01:24 Yeah, it is, it's always,
02:01:25 there's some reason it's always lava.
02:01:26 It's like trying something new for once.
02:01:27 It's always metaphorical lava.
02:01:28 He's doing video games, what the fuck, no.
02:01:30 You know, actually in Mario Odyssey,
02:01:33 there's a volcano full of like, gravy or shit.
02:01:35 Okay, all right.
02:01:38 This is why, left or right,
02:01:40 I don't think it makes sense to tie them into good and evil.
02:01:43 But I do kind of think you can link good and evil
02:01:46 to the top and bottom of this two A,
02:01:49 which is authoritarian versus libertarian.
02:01:52 Because I just think that the solution to all these problems
02:01:55 is for everyone to be self-sufficient,
02:01:57 not worry about what other fucking people are doing,
02:02:00 and just mind their own goddamn business.
02:02:02 I think that is just the best way to be.
02:02:05 Stop telling me what to do.
02:02:06 If everyone did that.
02:02:07 Like, let the racist be racist.
02:02:08 It would probably be good.
02:02:09 Who gives a fuck?
02:02:09 Because I got my shit going just fine over here,
02:02:12 they have no influence on me,
02:02:13 and those people can feel the same way
02:02:15 about these trans-degenerate, you know,
02:02:16 whatever's on the other side.
02:02:18 I mean, I mean, it's just,
02:02:20 if you let the racist be racist,
02:02:23 then they vote for fucking-
02:02:24 It's only a problem, it's only a problem.
02:02:26 If then authoritarianism comes back,
02:02:28 and they have leverage over the people.
02:02:31 Which they will vote to make happen.
02:02:32 I don't know, well, that's why I'm saying
02:02:34 that libertarianism is the good.
02:02:36 That is the way to be,
02:02:38 so that people don't have this shit hanging over them,
02:02:40 and there's no threat to anyone.
02:02:42 That's whatever.
02:02:43 I know that's idealistic and not practical,
02:02:45 but I'm just saying, that's what I've ever seen.
02:02:48 I gotcha.
02:02:49 How many fucking voicemails do we have?
02:02:50 We got seven more.
02:02:52 Like, four, like, oh boy.
02:02:52 We don't have to do them all that long, let's go.
02:02:55 Okay, next one, this is from Cholo Jones.
02:02:59 Let's see what he's got for us.
02:03:02 You know, I have a real problem with people just saying,
02:03:05 they're so irresponsible, they can't do anything.
02:03:08 They all just need to get a responsibility board,
02:03:11 get just a fucking white board or a cork board,
02:03:13 and stop being so gay,
02:03:15 and just write down all the things you get done.
02:03:17 And if you don't accomplish them,
02:03:18 you'll have something right there
02:03:19 to remind you of what a failure are.
02:03:21 You should get off your ass.
02:03:23 Also, I have a problem with,
02:03:24 did you think that animals just shouldn't exist?
02:03:30 You won't find that sympathy here.
02:03:32 Pokemon that are, like, you know,
02:03:34 just not quite as cool, because they're like the same thing.
02:03:37 You know, animals are Pokemon, is my point.
02:03:43 No, dude.
02:03:44 Did you use a known Pokemon, Robert?
02:03:45 You don't wanna collect all the animals.
02:03:47 Can you imagine how hellish that would be?
02:03:50 I'm gonna come down hard on the didgy side
02:03:52 of this today, animals against them.
02:03:54 I mean, me and, I'm with Carl Pilkington,
02:03:57 who thinks that animals are redundant,
02:03:58 and most of them probably don't need to exist.
02:04:02 Like, how many slow insects do you need?
02:04:04 Like, yeah, we've got the snail and the inchworm.
02:04:07 Like, what do we need both for?
02:04:09 They do the same thing.
02:04:11 You're not wrong, you're not wrong.
02:04:14 Shit, did I title this one wrong?
02:04:15 Oh, no, sorry, I've got the next one open.
02:04:17 Yeah, I like animals, so I'm on this guy's side.
02:04:20 They're cool, you know, mostly dogs.
02:04:22 Don't really care about the other ones.
02:04:23 I like me some chicken wings.
02:04:26 Agreed.
02:04:27 All right, let's just move on to the next one.
02:04:28 All right, let's fuck this whole gay shit.
02:04:30 All right, here we go, play.
02:04:32 This is from Free Patreon Money.
02:04:34 This is from Free Patreon Money.
02:04:37 Oh my God.
02:04:38 I like this call already.
02:04:39 Answer this one.
02:04:40 Here we go.
02:04:41 All right, I have the deal of a fucking lifetime right here.
02:04:45 Sounds like monthly.
02:04:46 This is the epic deal.
02:04:47 I thought it was monthly for a second.
02:04:48 I like this girl, I like her a lot,
02:04:51 and we talk sometimes, we're friends.
02:04:52 And I wanna be her girlfriend, I wanna date her.
02:04:55 So give me some advice,
02:04:56 and if she becomes my girlfriend,
02:04:58 then this is what you receive.
02:04:59 You get Patreon donations galore.
02:05:02 I'll donate lots of money to every single Patreon
02:05:06 for the everything, all the links that are in the description.
02:05:10 This is one of her other links that exists.
02:05:12 I'll get all of the money,
02:05:14 and I'll do it real good.
02:05:16 Just give me some advice.
02:05:17 I want this girl so bad.
02:05:18 Okay, I know exactly what to do.
02:05:20 I know the answer to this.
02:05:22 So like, okay, she's a girl,
02:05:25 she's your friend, and you really wanna be with her.
02:05:28 And you don't know how to, here's what you do.
02:05:29 You don't, you fucking, you sneak it in a little bit.
02:05:34 You fuck, like a little bit at a time.
02:05:36 Like you just kind of, you know,
02:05:37 you're hanging out with her like normal,
02:05:39 and you're laughing and you're joking.
02:05:40 You're being cool, you're being your regular cool self,
02:05:43 like nothing's different.
02:05:44 And then like, you sort of slip in,
02:05:46 like you look nice, or you look,
02:05:47 you look, your hair is nice today,
02:05:49 or something that she'll like notice, you know?
02:05:52 Yeah, just to acclimate her to the idea
02:05:57 of seeing you as a sexual being.
02:06:00 You've gotta, you've gotta like,
02:06:01 and when you finally do like sort of pop the question,
02:06:04 like hey, you wanna kind of like be together,
02:06:07 like a fucking like you and me, and like a romantic thing.
02:06:09 You gotta say it, you gotta be casual about it,
02:06:12 and if she's not cool with it, and she's not okay with it,
02:06:14 you gotta act like it didn't even really matter to you.
02:06:16 It was just a dumb stray thought in your head,
02:06:17 and just drop it, and then like,
02:06:18 you maybe ask it again like six months,
02:06:20 but you know, if, whenever she rejects you,
02:06:22 just act like it doesn't even fucking matter,
02:06:24 and it's just dumb, because if you say to her,
02:06:28 all of a sudden, I'm in love with you,
02:06:30 and we really have to be together,
02:06:31 and I want you to be my girlfriend,
02:06:33 and I want to be in love with you forever,
02:06:36 that's, you're gonna be in a bad situation,
02:06:39 if you fucking do that.
02:06:40 You won't want that, you won't want that.
02:06:40 Don't do it, yeah.
02:06:42 And especially if you do that, and she says no,
02:06:45 and then you take it like, hard,
02:06:48 then here, you're really in trouble if you take it hard.
02:06:51 That's a bad look.
02:06:51 That's true.
02:06:52 That's a bad look.
02:06:53 Ask yourself this question,
02:06:54 and you have to be honest about this.
02:06:57 It's, am I, do I, am I willing to risk my friendship
02:07:02 with this person to date them,
02:07:04 or to phrase it another way,
02:07:05 it's like, is this person's friendship important enough
02:07:11 to me to not jeopardize the date?
02:07:13 It's like, do you want this person as a friend,
02:07:15 or do you really just want to date them,
02:07:17 and you're kind of just killing time
02:07:18 until you can get them to date you?
02:07:19 Yeah.
02:07:20 If you really want to date them,
02:07:22 and you're just being friends with them in the meantime,
02:07:24 like as the stopgap measures,
02:07:25 you should just go ahead and fuck you up.
02:07:27 The question you've got to ask is if they were a dude,
02:07:29 would you still be hanging out with them?
02:07:31 And if the answer is no, you're fooling yourself.
02:07:34 You just got to pretend to be really totally confident,
02:07:39 and just be like, yeah, agreed.
02:07:41 Hey, I want to go out with you, how about that, huh?
02:07:43 What, no?
02:07:44 It doesn't matter.
02:07:45 I'm just being cool, whatever, baby.
02:07:46 I'm just being cool.
02:07:48 Yeah, exactly that.
02:07:51 Write that down and practice it in the mirror.
02:07:54 Hey, guys, I'm just being cool.
02:07:55 Hey, hey, hey, I'm not trying to be weird here,
02:07:58 and I'm just being cool,
02:07:59 but I thought maybe it all in you and me,
02:08:00 and I'm just being cool.
02:08:01 Here's the thing, here's the thing.
02:08:04 On some level, I think that that might actually work,
02:08:06 because humans are very weak and susceptible,
02:08:09 and I think that if you insist that you are cool enough,
02:08:13 I think that some people will come to believe it.
02:08:17 It's all confidence.
02:08:18 Yeah, confidence is just a repeat.
02:08:20 You need to have the volume as well.
02:08:20 If you just repeat the association,
02:08:22 just repeat the association.
02:08:23 Me, cool.
02:08:24 Wait, what?
02:08:25 It gives it how long to be assertive and confident.
02:08:28 Oh, yeah, yeah, it's like me, cool.
02:08:31 Every time I've tried to be cool in that way,
02:08:33 people associate you with coolness.
02:08:35 Yeah, I've attempted little things like that.
02:08:38 But that's how advertising works.
02:08:40 I've attempted little things like that before,
02:08:42 but it has come always down to the fact
02:08:44 that I have a small, meek voice,
02:08:47 and it doesn't work, no matter what I say.
02:08:49 People, girls, and...
02:08:50 I have to be louder in order for people to give it to me.
02:08:53 Some people would find it cheesy and make fun of you,
02:08:56 but I guarantee you at least some people
02:08:59 would begin to associate you with being cool.
02:09:01 Well, it was like that time,
02:09:02 I think that's interesting.
02:09:03 That blessed interaction I had in line
02:09:05 to get into the food court or whatever at college,
02:09:08 when I was talking to my friends about,
02:09:10 I can't remember what it was,
02:09:11 something about like, I don't know,
02:09:13 I think making out, I think it was unrelated,
02:09:16 but whatever we had said,
02:09:17 the guy in front of us in line interpreted as this.
02:09:21 And he's like, turns out, I was like,
02:09:22 whoa, you guys do that too?
02:09:24 Just go up to girls at parties and ask them to make out?
02:09:27 One of them's gonna say yes,
02:09:29 and the thing is, he's right.
02:09:31 The thing is, he's right.
02:09:32 And I love that, man, he's a brother.
02:09:35 I mean, the drunk ones probably.
02:09:37 Yeah, well, I mean, what's your goal here?
02:09:38 Is your goal just to make out?
02:09:40 And that gets, sure, go for it.
02:09:41 If your goal is to form a relationship,
02:09:43 this might not be the best way to do it, or whatever.
02:09:46 What if you go up to every girl,
02:09:48 he's like asking them to make out,
02:09:50 forgetting that you are wearing your Trump hat,
02:09:53 and all of them attack you?
02:09:57 They'll say, I'll tell you what you do.
02:09:58 I'll tell you what you do.
02:09:59 I'll tell you what you do.
02:10:00 Just go, hey, baby, I'm just being cool.
02:10:02 I'm just being cool.
02:10:03 I'm just being cool, I'm just being cool.
02:10:05 You're in New York City, walking down a lot of traffic.
02:10:06 Hey, I'm being cool here.
02:10:09 Hey, I'm being cool here.
02:10:11 You just turn your cap backwards,
02:10:13 and they can't see they're making America great again,
02:10:15 and it's just really cool.
02:10:17 You come out of the voting booth,
02:10:18 just fresh after voting for Trump and your MAGA hat,
02:10:21 and you get mobbed, you get mobbed by SJW cucks,
02:10:25 and they're like, hey, man, I'm just being cool, guys.
02:10:29 I'm just trying to be cool here.
02:10:31 They think you're a Trumper seeing the front of your hat,
02:10:33 but you just, you turn your hat backwards,
02:10:37 and it's like, oh, he's just being cool.
02:10:39 He's just being cool.
02:10:40 He's in the backwards.
02:10:41 That's cool.
02:10:41 Now, that's what Trump himself should do.
02:10:43 He should get out of the podium.
02:10:44 Lib Tards hate this one weird old tip to just be cool.
02:10:48 Turn your hat on that MAGA hat.
02:10:50 Trump should give a speech next time,
02:10:51 like the whole nation is mad at him
02:10:53 for something that he did.
02:10:54 He should just be like, hey, I'm just being cool.
02:10:57 I don't know, I'm just trying to be cool.
02:10:59 Look, America, I'm just trying to be cool here.
02:11:05 I like, like, instead of saying I'm trying to be cool,
02:11:07 just to say I am being cool, I'm just being right.
02:11:10 Like, the declaration is part of why it's so serious.
02:11:13 I'm just being cool.
02:11:14 Look, I'm just being cool.
02:11:15 I'm not being an asshole.
02:11:17 I'm just being cool.
02:11:20 It's on the news.
02:11:21 It turns out President Trump is cool.
02:11:23 I swear, I swear it'll work.
02:11:25 Yeah, at last.
02:11:26 The human brain is simple enough.
02:11:28 He skates skateboard onto the podium.
02:11:29 I believe that the human brain is simple enough
02:11:31 that that would work and have its desired effect.
02:11:34 Yeah, I think so too.
02:11:35 I think so too.
02:11:37 I'm just being cool.
02:11:38 Did you guys see that guy?
02:11:39 There was a Democratic challenger to Ted Cruz
02:11:42 in Running for Senate during the election,
02:11:44 who like, Beto O'Rourke, that was him.
02:11:46 He literally skateboarded out, I think, multiple times
02:11:49 to the podium to, I think he's the genesis point
02:11:53 of this whole just be and cool thing.
02:11:55 It didn't work though when he lost.
02:11:56 I mean, people have been, well, it wasn't that cool.
02:11:59 Yeah, it wasn't cool enough.
02:12:02 Wasn't wearing a backwards hat.
02:12:03 People have been being cool since the beginning of time.
02:12:05 All right, let's move on to our next question here.
02:12:08 This is from Been There Since Day One.
02:12:11 What's the name of this guy?
02:12:12 All right, let's see.
02:12:13 Oh boohoo, I'm a Gen 1 PCB watcher
02:12:16 and I want the original theme back.
02:12:18 Yeah, me too, dawg.
02:12:28 Yeah.
02:12:43 Welcome to this show.
02:12:48 I want to do it.
02:12:51 Is this the same guy who did the megalovania
02:12:53 because he's good on piano?
02:12:55 Yeah.
02:12:56 Man, you know, every once in a while,
02:12:59 I remember that I put together some fucking dumb piano loop
02:13:03 that people cover and it fills me with the weirdest ride.
02:13:07 It's nice.
02:13:08 So, you know, I mean, not to poke holes in your story,
02:13:13 Mr. Been There Since Day One,
02:13:15 you know, we didn't have the theme song in the beginning.
02:13:18 Oh, Christ.
02:13:19 That was like 50, what was that, like 50 episodes in,
02:13:22 that we got that?
02:13:23 Maybe like, maybe not that.
02:13:24 Something like that, maybe 20, 30, I don't know.
02:13:28 Well, I do, I like, yeah, I don't understand people
02:13:33 that whine about the old theme.
02:13:34 I mean, I like the old theme song.
02:13:35 The new theme song incorporates it.
02:13:37 You know, maybe you liked the runner up better.
02:13:39 You know, I'm sorry.
02:13:40 I guess they could just think it straight up just sounds better.
02:13:42 I suppose that's fair.
02:13:44 I don't know.
02:13:45 You know, I think it's kind of funny how divisive.
02:13:48 I think maybe that makes me like it more,
02:13:50 just how divisive the...
02:13:51 I kind of agree too.
02:13:52 I will continue to use the runner up every time I edit.
02:13:55 That's fine.
02:13:56 That's fair enough.
02:13:57 Fair enough.
02:13:58 I am the rebel.
02:13:59 All right.
02:14:00 Join my team.
02:14:01 Join my tribe.
02:14:02 Next one.
02:14:03 This is from Mookies.
02:14:05 Mookies.
02:14:06 Speak.
02:14:07 Okay, Tom, I know you're there.
02:14:09 You're on every single episode.
02:14:11 You need the money.
02:14:12 I know you're a poor boy.
02:14:13 I love you.
02:14:14 Now, a long time ago, you promised that you'd be making a Splatoon 2 I Am Games video.
02:14:20 Where is it?
02:14:21 I need it.
02:14:22 Splatoon 2 is the best game on Switch.
02:14:24 Mario Odyssey?
02:14:25 Dog shit.
02:14:26 Breath of the Wild?
02:14:27 Okay.
02:14:28 Octopath?
02:14:29 Really fucking fun.
02:14:30 Fucking Pokemon Let's Go?
02:14:31 Meh.
02:14:32 Probably not worth $60, but fucking Splatoon 2 is the Switch.
02:14:36 It is everything.
02:14:37 It is the best.
02:14:38 I need that video.
02:14:39 Make it now.
02:14:40 Thank you.
02:14:41 I'm on your friends list on Pokemon Go and the nicknames, like the puns you give your
02:14:48 Pokemon, your buddy Pokemon, they're funny.
02:14:50 I love them and I love you.
02:14:52 Okay.
02:14:53 Bye.
02:14:54 Whoa.
02:14:55 Thank you.
02:14:56 I have something to say about Pokemon Go.
02:14:57 I don't know when else I'll get a chance to say this, but you know who I'm friends with
02:15:01 on Pokemon Go is none other than Russell.
02:15:04 Oh, yeah.
02:15:05 Okay.
02:15:06 And he is decked out in Gengar Atalia.
02:15:09 He is all Gengar all the time.
02:15:11 He's real fucking scary.
02:15:13 So Tom, how about it?
02:15:14 Yeah, I'll get to it at some point.
02:15:16 There was a while when I was, I planned on doing it like God, like months ago, but then
02:15:22 I, they brought Nintendo Switch online, the online service up and I didn't have it.
02:15:27 So I'm like, well, I can't even play Splatoon 2 anymore.
02:15:30 Fuck.
02:15:31 But then someone generously gave me access to their family plan thing.
02:15:35 So now I have it again.
02:15:36 So I have like notes for a script kind of written up.
02:15:39 The idea is just like, it's the most comfortable multiplayer game ever and it's not gay and
02:15:43 it's fun.
02:15:44 And it doesn't make you feel like shit when you lose because it's just happy and good
02:15:47 and all the aesthetic and everything like, like, like the lobby just like, like you,
02:15:52 you go and do these fights and everything and then like go back to the lobby and everything's
02:15:55 kind of chill and everyone's just hanging out.
02:15:56 Like all the people you were just fighting just like populate the lobby and it's like
02:15:59 kind of reminds you it's just a game.
02:16:01 It's fun.
02:16:02 Don't, don't get mad.
02:16:03 It's not worth it.
02:16:04 Like you don't, it's just better.
02:16:05 It's the best.
02:16:06 It's fun.
02:16:07 It's comfy.
02:16:08 It's great.
02:16:09 And it began and ended multiplayer gaming.
02:16:11 Splatoon 2 was the Alpha and the Omega and it's great.
02:16:13 So there you go.
02:16:14 There's a Cliff Notes version, dude.
02:16:15 I got you.
02:16:16 I feel you on that.
02:16:18 Did you play the DLC?
02:16:20 You don't have the DLC yet.
02:16:22 I just want to go on record.
02:16:24 I beat the main game and I beat the DLC recently and I beat all 80 levels in the DLC and I'm
02:16:32 on the secret super duper uber final boss and it's so fucking frustrating.
02:16:37 It's a piece of, Splatoon kind of has terrible controls and I kind of hate everything about
02:16:43 how you play that game.
02:16:45 Oh, it was great up to this secret boss and now it's shit and I'm mad.
02:16:50 Your problem is you're playing a single player Splatoon 2.
02:16:52 Why would you do that?
02:16:53 I know.
02:16:54 I've never touched the campaign.
02:16:55 I don't even care about the multiplayer.
02:16:56 You don't care about the multiplayer.
02:16:57 Oh my god.
02:16:58 No, no, no.
02:16:59 The campaign is great.
02:17:00 I love the campaign.
02:17:01 Splatoon is worth it just for the single player for me personally.
02:17:05 The single player in Splatoon 1 was pretty fun, but I mean the game's about the multiplayer.
02:17:09 I literally don't care about the multiplayer.
02:17:11 I can't use the ink brush in the campaign.
02:17:14 It gives me the guns and I don't want to use the gun.
02:17:16 I want to use the ink brush because that's fun.
02:17:18 Well, in the DLC.
02:17:19 I want to use the roller.
02:17:21 Yeah, I want to use the bus story, the lore, the song at the end of the fucking DLC.
02:17:27 Can you beat it?
02:17:28 I played through the whole game.
02:17:30 The main story is about Marie and Callie.
02:17:33 Marie's disappeared.
02:17:35 I think that's her.
02:17:36 Callie disappeared.
02:17:37 Callie disappeared.
02:17:38 No, Callie disappeared.
02:17:39 Yes, that's right.
02:17:40 I'm gonna play this and I know it more than you.
02:17:43 I just forget the names.
02:17:44 That's it.
02:17:45 The new Squid Girls or whatever, the black one and the little one.
02:17:48 I forget their fucking name.
02:17:49 Pearl and Marina.
02:17:50 Pearl and Marina.
02:17:51 Yeah.
02:17:52 You don't know anything about them, but the DLC gives them character and fleshes them out.
02:17:56 They like them now and they got cool songs and they're cool guys and the levels are fun
02:18:02 and it was a real challenge to beat it.
02:18:04 And this final fucking boss is just so fuck.
02:18:07 I hate Splatoon's combat system so much despite everything I just said.
02:18:12 It's shit.
02:18:13 It's a multiplayer game.
02:18:14 It's not designed for what you're doing.
02:18:16 I want 100% believe everything you just said, but are you telling me that you don't play
02:18:20 the multiplayer?
02:18:21 Like every once in a while I will fire it up for a little bit, but I weigh disproportionately
02:18:24 more enjoy to the single player than I enjoy the multiplayer every once in a while.
02:18:28 Incredible.
02:18:29 Which is just because I love the single player so much.
02:18:31 It's got so much style.
02:18:32 It's got so much personality.
02:18:33 I mean that oozes in every facet of Splatoon.
02:18:35 Sure.
02:18:36 Splatoon is aesthetically.
02:18:37 Yeah.
02:18:38 Yeah.
02:18:39 The aesthetic is unbelievable.
02:18:42 I love it so much.
02:18:43 It's so, it's perfect.
02:18:44 It is perfect.
02:18:45 The whole, the urban, the hip, the hip urban youth culture.
02:18:48 It's great.
02:18:49 Shit.
02:18:50 I cannot wait to play as Inkling.
02:18:51 The neon, the neon colors.
02:18:52 My one upset thing is that Inkling is in Splatoon, is in Smash, New Smash, but that
02:18:59 Octobitch is not like a, you know, not a costume.
02:19:03 Like an alternate costume.
02:19:05 I mean they could make it a fucking Echo Fighter I guess, but just make it a costume.
02:19:08 I just want the costume.
02:19:09 That's all I care about.
02:19:10 Because Octolingirl is an 8 out of 8 and I love her.
02:19:14 Agent 8.
02:19:15 That's her name.
02:19:16 Basically the second.
02:19:17 No.
02:19:18 Her hairstyle being different.
02:19:19 They just have different hair.
02:19:20 And her different eye makeup.
02:19:21 It's a huge difference.
02:19:22 Okay.
02:19:23 But anyway.
02:19:24 All right.
02:19:25 Fine.
02:19:26 Let's move along.
02:19:27 I will beat it though.
02:19:28 I will beat that fucking boss.
02:19:29 It's a piece of shit though.
02:19:30 All right.
02:19:31 Next, next call is from, oh wait.
02:19:33 You know what?
02:19:34 This is from Munchy.
02:19:35 It's this guy.
02:19:36 Enlightened history major.
02:19:37 Just saying how cool Munchy is for being in history.
02:19:39 I'm just going to skip that one since he's not here.
02:19:41 Yeah.
02:19:42 All right.
02:19:43 Let's go to the next one.
02:19:44 This is from, here we go.
02:19:45 This is a good one.
02:19:46 This PCP fan is calling in to update us on his current situation.
02:19:51 I used to be the biggest fan of the PCP.
02:19:54 Every day I would listen to Digi Bro's Toofless, gummy voice echo from my brain.
02:20:00 And when I say fan, I don't mean triple Joker LMFAO.
02:20:04 No, I was deep into that PCP war.
02:20:08 I was here.
02:20:09 Triple Joker's trip pretty deep.
02:20:10 I think that Collins played the role of me app on the world famous web series inanimate
02:20:15 insanity 2.
02:20:16 You're more just a Digi.
02:20:17 I personally find that to be underrated.
02:20:19 And there I say, rad.
02:20:22 Funny joke.
02:20:24 But back to my story.
02:20:28 I had this internet discord GF.
02:20:30 Oh no.
02:20:31 And one day I showed her the PCP.
02:20:33 All of it.
02:20:34 The entire PCP.
02:20:36 No.
02:20:37 Did you tie her up and make her listen?
02:20:39 No.
02:20:40 And she sent me and said that this podcast is shit.
02:20:43 And will never be as real or interesting as the Jill Rogan experience.
02:20:47 Oh come on.
02:20:48 That's not right.
02:20:49 No.
02:20:50 Left me for a red pill to YouTube commentator who makes fun of autistic people for easy money.
02:20:56 And that's when I decided to drop out of school and become my own internet personality.
02:21:00 My own superhero from the depths of the underground internet scene.
02:21:06 And well now I'm homeless.
02:21:10 It didn't work out I guess.
02:21:12 Jinkling change on the sidewalk of Skid Row.
02:21:16 And I blame you.
02:21:18 This is all your fault.
02:21:20 Fuck you.
02:21:21 No, no, no, no.
02:21:22 The only response to this is the procrastinator's podcast.
02:21:25 Where the reason people are dying.
02:21:26 Next call.
02:21:27 Right.
02:21:28 Yeah.
02:21:29 We are.
02:21:30 We are.
02:21:31 This guy's not long for this world.
02:21:32 God.
02:21:33 She cut us deep.
02:21:34 Cut us deep with that.
02:21:35 We're not as good as the Joe Rogan experience.
02:21:37 How could we compete with Joe Rogan?
02:21:38 God damn it.
02:21:39 He's got.
02:21:40 I don't know.
02:21:41 He gets interesting guests.
02:21:42 We have too much hair to compete with Joe Rogan unfortunately.
02:21:46 That's true.
02:21:47 He's too powerful.
02:21:48 We can't beat him.
02:21:49 We gotta join a little crowd.
02:21:50 We gotta get Joe Rogan a PCPist.
02:21:52 Clearly.
02:21:53 Can we get.
02:21:54 Here's the idea.
02:21:55 Okay.
02:21:56 Joe Rogan podcast.
02:21:57 Next episode.
02:21:58 It's the entirety of the PCP is the one guest.
02:22:01 Oh, and every word is spoken by a different member in a circular order.
02:22:05 That'd be good.
02:22:07 Let's make that happen.
02:22:08 Oh, like the kids from code name kids next door.
02:22:11 Oh, yeah.
02:22:12 The lovely children from down the lane or whatever.
02:22:14 The delightful children.
02:22:15 The delightful children.
02:22:16 God.
02:22:17 I loved those.
02:22:18 God.
02:22:19 That's the best fucking show code name kids next door.
02:22:21 Literally great.
02:22:22 Literally insane pathos and character development.
02:22:25 The best.
02:22:27 I also remember when Digi was on inanimate insanity too.
02:22:31 What a weird, what a weird time.
02:22:33 Doesn't he still regularly do that voice?
02:22:35 I mean, I don't know when they last did it.
02:22:37 Well, I haven't heard about it in forever, but maybe.
02:22:40 He plays like the, what, like the fucking iMac Pro or something.
02:22:43 I gotta imagine that they wrote like tons and tons of scripts and he probably recorded
02:22:48 lines for way in advance.
02:22:50 Probably.
02:22:51 To the extent that they might still be animating new episodes with like lines that he recorded
02:22:55 like who knows how long ago.
02:22:56 Yeah.
02:22:57 Yeah.
02:22:58 All right.
02:22:59 Well, Joe, I have actually dreamed about Joe Rogan bringing me on the podcast and I'm
02:23:04 just, I think about that and I'm like, I am not interesting enough.
02:23:07 I have nothing to contribute to, to be invited on this podcast.
02:23:11 It's kind of funny how like we're focusing on the Joe Rogan aspect of this guy who's
02:23:16 I do listen to him a lot and blaming us.
02:23:18 Oh, I forgot about his whole girlfriend and his girlfriend ruined his life because we,
02:23:23 not because we were bad, but because we weren't as good as the Joe Rogan experience.
02:23:29 Yeah.
02:23:30 Have me on Joe.
02:23:31 We'll make it happen.
02:23:33 You know what?
02:23:34 This actually makes me actually sad to think that I am not an interesting enough person
02:23:38 to be on Joe Rogan's show.
02:23:40 Well, I was good.
02:23:41 I was just gonna be sad.
02:23:42 I was just gonna be sad.
02:23:43 Like there's, that's, that's quitter's attitude and like what, why is it low?
02:23:46 Okay.
02:23:47 Well, here's the thing.
02:23:48 I guess that's a good question.
02:23:49 They had MKBHD on Joe Rogan and MKBHD is not exactly an interesting guy.
02:23:54 He just like, dude, he's got tons to talk about.
02:23:57 He just, he just knows about tech.
02:23:58 He just attacks you.
02:23:59 No, listen, listen, there's not, there's nothing interesting.
02:24:03 If there's nothing, like the people, I don't know what kind of guests Joe Rogan or anyone
02:24:08 else gets on.
02:24:09 Like anyone, right?
02:24:10 Yeah.
02:24:11 Like these people are not inherently more interesting.
02:24:12 They do all the same shit as everyone else.
02:24:14 They're only interesting because they have a cloud, you know, which let's be honest is
02:24:17 just an accident.
02:24:18 You know what?
02:24:19 It's just an accident of history.
02:24:20 They're interesting inherently because of their cloud and because people previously know them.
02:24:24 It's not that these people have more interesting experience.
02:24:26 We're gonna try and sweep all this under the rug and be like, Joe Rogan, whatever, Joe Rogan
02:24:31 on a good deal, it's fine.
02:24:32 And then next, the new episode is gonna come out and it's gonna be fucking laserbot on
02:24:36 the Joe Rogan experience and then it's all gonna fall into place.
02:24:39 Damn it, laserbot!
02:24:40 Oh, if Joe Rogan got fucking laserbot, I would fucking kill myself.
02:24:44 You know?
02:24:45 He's mine, damn it, he's mine!
02:24:47 You don't want your ceiling to be the H3 podcast.
02:24:51 You wanna strive for Joe Rogan.
02:24:53 I agree.
02:24:54 I agree.
02:24:55 Which I think we've pretty, you know, this is maybe a little sad as well.
02:24:58 I think I've settled into a hierarchy of podcasts in my mind.
02:25:01 Number one is Joe Rogan.
02:25:02 And then quite a bit down there is the H3 podcast.
02:25:06 I've never listened to Joe Rogan, by the way.
02:25:09 Just putting that out there.
02:25:10 Yeah.
02:25:11 There's a lot of good stuff.
02:25:12 I don't know.
02:25:13 I recommend it.
02:25:14 It's on the Stone Cold Steve Austin podcast.
02:25:16 Now, there's a goal.
02:25:17 Now, there's a goal.
02:25:18 You know what's funny, though?
02:25:19 My years ago, my buddy Doug told me about how great the Joe Rogan podcast was.
02:25:24 It was probably four or five years ago.
02:25:25 And I was like, oh, who the fuck's that guy?
02:25:27 I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
02:25:29 And now I listen regularly and I'm a huge fan.
02:25:31 I have never once spoken to him about this.
02:25:33 I should do that at some point.
02:25:35 All right.
02:25:36 Anyway, let's move on to that.
02:25:38 And he'll probably be like, oh, you're still listening to Joe Rogan podcast, bro.
02:25:42 I'm moving up in the world.
02:25:44 It's all about Harmontown now.
02:25:46 Yeah, that's true.
02:25:48 These fucking Big Shot podcast, they're fucking, I'm so sick of them.
02:25:53 No, I'm not.
02:25:54 I love them.
02:25:55 I love listening to podcasts.
02:25:56 I'm sick of them being bearded.
02:25:59 I really love Fat Man on Batman.
02:26:01 That's the only thing I hate about them.
02:26:02 I don't know.
02:26:03 It's the Kevin Smith podcast.
02:26:04 Oh, Kevin Smith.
02:26:05 Yeah.
02:26:06 Kevin Smith's, yeah.
02:26:07 I didn't know he was still doing it.
02:26:08 He does it, but now it's a video podcast and he films it.
02:26:11 Way in the past when he had Tara Strong on, and now I liked Tara Strong because of Twilight Sparkle.
02:26:18 No, no, on the Fat Man on Batman had Tara Strong because she does Spat Girl, I think.
02:26:23 And she's also a fucking Harley Quinn.
02:26:24 Yeah.
02:26:25 Oh, yeah.
02:26:26 She's like every female voice.
02:26:28 He does it now.
02:26:29 Like they film it in like this special bar with like an audience.
02:26:32 So it's like, they're standing up microphones and it's really, really cool.
02:26:37 That's a good thing.
02:26:39 That sounds cool.
02:26:40 I should check it out.
02:26:41 I just want to say for fun that the reason why this is solidified so much in my mind,
02:26:47 it's kind of like an alpha male dominance hierarchy thing that makes me think that Joe
02:26:51 Rogan is so much better than H3, even though H3 is pretty good when I've listened.
02:26:55 It's specifically that H3 had Bill Burr on who's like an equal, a contemporary of Joe
02:27:00 Rogan.
02:27:01 They're both comedians.
02:27:02 And that Bill Burr podcast destroyed Ethan's like status in my mind.
02:27:08 Because he just got so blown over by Bill who was just so, he was like so like not interested
02:27:16 in being there and was just like bulldozing Ethan.
02:27:19 It's so sad.
02:27:20 I'm sorry.
02:27:21 I didn't mean to like, you know, it was sad.
02:27:23 It's too bad for him.
02:27:24 It's sad seeing the difference between like a top comedian and a top fucking YouTube comedian.
02:27:29 You know, it is.
02:27:30 It's fascinating.
02:27:31 It is fascinating to see that.
02:27:33 I got to see this.
02:27:34 I want to see Ethan square him.
02:27:35 Not because I hate him, but I've never heard of this.
02:27:38 Yeah.
02:27:39 Check it out.
02:27:40 Ethan is, you know, I don't mind Ethan or anything, but he is pretty smug.
02:27:43 Yeah.
02:27:44 I suppose.
02:27:45 I think it would be fun.
02:27:46 Yeah.
02:27:47 It's interesting if nothing else.
02:27:48 It always like, yeah.
02:27:49 It always weirds me out just to think of like, all the comedians are like sort of, like
02:27:56 they all know each other, like all the big, like Joe Rogan and Bill Burr and Dave Chappelle
02:28:01 and Mark Maron and like, they all are like friends somehow because they've all like intersected
02:28:06 in their careers at some point.
02:28:07 It's just a weird thing to think.
02:28:09 I like these like totally different people who are all like huge, like A-list comedians
02:28:14 and show business guys are all fucking.
02:28:17 I kind of, I kind of covet that community of theirs.
02:28:20 It's pretty fucking cool.
02:28:22 And you know, I've thought a little bit about, I mean, I don't know.
02:28:25 I've been thinking about like, okay, where does YouTube go eventually?
02:28:28 You know, maybe it goes somewhere great.
02:28:30 Maybe YouTube is great forever.
02:28:31 The thought has crossed my mind.
02:28:33 Maybe one day I could like literally be a comedian.
02:28:36 I don't even know if that means like a stand-up comedian, but like, you know, something along
02:28:40 those lines.
02:28:41 I really love to do a stand-up night like you did, Jesse.
02:28:45 Yeah.
02:28:46 Just try it out.
02:28:47 Get out there.
02:28:48 I happened to log on to Reddit the other day on the comedy and someone had posted in the
02:28:53 comedy my bit on meeting women that I did.
02:28:57 Dude, no way.
02:28:58 Yeah, that's dope.
02:28:59 I watched it again.
02:29:00 I watched it back for the first time in years and like I was like blown away because like
02:29:04 I forgot that I did that and that it was so funny.
02:29:08 Like I think back to it like, you know, people tell me it's funny, but like there's no way.
02:29:12 Like I didn't have any planned material.
02:29:15 I fucking, I made up the whole bit like sitting in the audience before I came on stage like
02:29:19 ignoring everyone else's bit while I was like writing it in my head in my seat.
02:29:24 Like Cody looked over at me and he's like, are you like, okay, are you sick?
02:29:27 Cause I was like, I was like so in my own head like, like formulating what I was going
02:29:31 to say for the next 10 minutes.
02:29:32 So like I didn't, I never remember it.
02:29:35 I never like think of it as some like great thing that I'm proud of, but like I was watching
02:29:39 it the other day cause someone had linked it on Reddit and I was like, yes, this is fucking
02:29:44 one of the best things I've ever done and I'm really proud of it and like I want so
02:29:49 bad to do more of that and like I want to elevate myself beyond the, this muck of YouTube
02:29:55 because like it really seems like because of a lot of what gets popular on YouTube and
02:30:02 people are wise to the fact that most big YouTubers are kind of talentless narcissists.
02:30:07 I mean, let's be honest.
02:30:08 I mean, you know, I know what you mean, but I mean, like you've got, you know, like your
02:30:11 Logan Paul's like it's always in the news and that's what people think of when they
02:30:14 think of a YouTuber.
02:30:16 So like there's this like huge YouTuber stigma.
02:30:19 Like even if you're really talented and really funny and really good, if you're doing it
02:30:23 on YouTube, people just think less of you.
02:30:26 And like I think about that, um, that, uh, that guy, Jordan Peterson, who's like always
02:30:33 in the news and like he's always, you know, on everyone's big podcasts, he's like a big
02:30:37 deal now.
02:30:38 And like, yeah, he's a, he, he, people take him seriously because he's a psychologist
02:30:46 and he's like a doctor.
02:30:47 He went to like a real school, but like, but he's also a YouTuber.
02:30:51 So like it really makes you realize that you have to go do something in the real world
02:30:57 in order to carry that clout over to YouTube because YouTube alone has no clout because
02:31:01 of the stuff that's risen to the surface on it.
02:31:04 So people just like, you have to go out and be a real standup comedian or be a, or go
02:31:09 to college to be a real doctor to be taken seriously as a, on YouTube at all.
02:31:14 I know what you mean.
02:31:15 There, there's definitely something to that.
02:31:17 If you, if you, I mean, if YouTube's all you do, then what is there to you?
02:31:21 And it sucks because like, like, it's hard when, cause like to think that in a lot of
02:31:29 people's minds, you're just a YouTuber because YouTuber is YouTube is all you do.
02:31:34 But like in my mind, I never think of myself as a YouTuber.
02:31:38 I think of myself as like a songwriter and a rapper and a comedian and a director and
02:31:42 a fucking this guy and this guy and like all these different things I do.
02:31:46 And like, where the fuck else am I supposed to post that shit?
02:31:49 Like I, I don't really have much opportunity to post my work anywhere but YouTube.
02:31:55 So I have to live with this fucking YouTube stigma.
02:31:58 Well, it's, it's like the part of the problem is not just that normal people who don't really
02:32:05 look at YouTube, hear about what YouTube is in the news and they have a stigma is that
02:32:09 YouTubers don't like care about quality in their own community necessarily.
02:32:17 Like if you want to get a good, a big podcast, you bring on other YouTubers and other people
02:32:23 who are big, not necessarily because you're a big fan of them, but because you need the
02:32:28 views and you need to-
02:32:29 Yeah, cause like the primary focus is not to like necessarily like, like a fucking direct
02:32:34 like a Stanley Kubrick exaggerating example, but whatever.
02:32:37 Like his goals, make the best movie possible.
02:32:40 The goal of like a YouTuber is play the algorithm is make them, the goal, yeah, the goal of
02:32:46 YouTubers make the most.
02:32:47 Yeah.
02:32:48 And that's, that's a bad incentive.
02:32:49 I don't like that.
02:32:50 Yeah.
02:32:51 If, if, if we were incentivized to like, to collaborate between like the best of the
02:32:57 best and like quality was like more at the forefront, then YouTubers would like at least
02:33:05 within themselves have some sort of cloud and like as more people grow up with YouTube,
02:33:12 understand that YouTubers are not inherently, you know, terrible and the stigma would eventually
02:33:16 fade away.
02:33:17 And this goes to Tom's, to Tom's like proposed platform of like you can only post one video
02:33:22 per month on that platform, which means it better be the best possible video it can be
02:33:27 to, you know, get-
02:33:28 There's a, there's a term that is like, that has risen in popularity that everyone uses
02:33:33 now that drives me crazy and like makes me like a little bit frustrated every time I
02:33:38 hear it.
02:33:39 And it's sound cloud rapper because when people talk about like popular rappers or rappers
02:33:45 who are, you know, coming up, they, they always say the term with so much derision, like it's
02:33:50 so much lower.
02:33:51 Like, oh, one of these fucking sound cloud rappers, well, what the fuck else is a rapper
02:33:56 supposed to do to fucking get his music out there?
02:33:58 Yeah.
02:33:59 Where, where would you, where would you put your friends?
02:34:01 Not everyone is going to have a fucking like a record company behind them or like a fucking
02:34:06 P-Ditty, like promoting their shit.
02:34:09 Like, yes.
02:34:10 I mean, it's the same as, same as YouTube, same as YouTube.
02:34:13 You know, how much of this is just kind of-
02:34:15 You gotta post it somewhere and you're not, you can't just expect to have like a fucking,
02:34:19 yeah, like a, like a-
02:34:20 So like is every rapper now, so, you know.
02:34:23 Thought of as a sound cloud rapper and thought of as less?
02:34:25 I guess it's the same, I guess it's the same kind of stigma as like a self-published author,
02:34:30 you know?
02:34:31 And now the things are just so similar.
02:34:34 And we have so much control at like the low levels and we don't need like to be either
02:34:38 literal the top, you know, top 10 musicians in the world to like get on a major label.
02:34:44 Instead, you just publish and you know, probably can get more like, I suppose it's kind of
02:34:49 a dream that there's like a middle class of artists that can survive, you know, not necessarily
02:34:54 as literally the top, but that, because we have access to posting shit on YouTube and
02:34:59 soundcloud and all that stuff.
02:35:01 It's kind of created an atmosphere of more, you know-
02:35:04 Everybody has-
02:35:05 That's juvenile.
02:35:06 That's juvenile.
02:35:07 Amateur.
02:35:08 It's not, it's, there's no more gatekeepers, you know, content just flows and people will
02:35:12 find it and you can find your own little cult micro audience and subsist off that and I
02:35:16 think that's a good thing.
02:35:17 I think it's a great thing.
02:35:19 I guess I just, I get why because that exists.
02:35:22 There's been an erosion of like the clout of like any given profession, because like,
02:35:27 if you were like a musician, you're like, do you hear the new whoever?
02:35:31 They're going to be like, who?
02:35:32 And you're going to be like, oh, you know, they're like the new one who was fucking signed
02:35:34 by, you know, P Diddy or whatever, fucking Motown or something, you're like, oh, shit,
02:35:38 that's impressive.
02:35:39 But you're like, no, it's this guy I'm listening to on soundcloud.
02:35:42 They're like, oh, so that means nothing to me.
02:35:45 That means, you know, whatever.
02:35:47 I mean, it means more and I guess it means like culture, culturally, I think it means
02:35:50 more, that means more and more and like record label is less and less meaningful as like,
02:35:56 you know, as the, as the, the, you know, the undoing, like the removal of like limiters
02:36:03 on like, I think it's all just like, creating your own cloud, right?
02:36:07 Because like, I think, for example, Ben, like your work, right?
02:36:11 Like you make comics, and that's fucking sick.
02:36:14 And you have like physical books and stuff, people can buy them.
02:36:17 But like the thing that, that like, I think works in your favor is that like, you go to
02:36:23 thesaintcomics.com to read your comics, go to Trigomoitopastic, or I post them on Deviantart.
02:36:28 You know, like that's like different mindsets, but like, you can, you can use social media
02:36:34 as like an advertising platform, essentially to like get the funnel people to like a platform
02:36:39 you control.
02:36:40 And like, once you do that, like the image is all your own, and like, it gives you an
02:36:44 air of authority to be like, oh, they have a dot com, you know, like that's like their
02:36:49 place.
02:36:50 Yeah.
02:36:51 You know, I happened to tune into Market How Do the other day, as you were talking about
02:36:58 this exact thing about about, yeah, owning your audience and using social media, not
02:37:03 in itself.
02:37:04 Because yeah, I don't, I don't want my main platform, like a lot of people's main platform
02:37:08 for their art and stuff is like their Tumblr, and like, I don't want my main platform to
02:37:12 be my Tumblr.
02:37:13 I want to have my website that's got my shit on it.
02:37:15 Will fewer people find it there?
02:37:17 Yeah, sure.
02:37:18 But like, you know, the people that are going to only look at it on Tumblr, they can see
02:37:24 it on Tumblr, or I almost said Tinder, I almost said Tinder, but Twitter or whatever.
02:37:29 And you know, but the people who want to follow the links and like go and find my actual, see
02:37:33 my actual website where I do have full control over the experience and all that.
02:37:38 And yeah, I do think it gives it an air of like, yeah, I own this, this is mine.
02:37:42 I made not only the content, but the platform you're viewing it on.
02:37:46 It makes it feel more legitimate.
02:37:48 Like I have in the past said, I have a comic friend who makes comics, you go to stcomics.com,
02:37:56 and then they've gone and read it.
02:37:57 And it was like, yeah.
02:37:59 It's pretty great.
02:38:00 And the experience of going to a tailor-made like specific site is so much nicer than going
02:38:09 to a social media platform where you may or may not have an account and it's like...
02:38:14 Using someone's comic on Tumblr is like, it's annoying because you usually have to
02:38:18 read it backwards.
02:38:19 You have to like add in like hyperlinks for the buttons and it never works very well
02:38:23 and Tumblr just sucks.
02:38:25 This is something why I'm kind of interested like why I'm personally big on this like whole
02:38:29 web 3.0 thing that me and Digi keep talking about because like, I want the pendulum to
02:38:33 shift back towards people making their own websites because I think the internet's just
02:38:37 more interesting that way because like everything's a new experience.
02:38:41 Yeah.
02:38:42 It was interesting because I was talking to Munchie about this and he didn't understand
02:38:45 what web 3.0, like what we were talking about until I explained it to him, like there's
02:38:48 no servers, it's all peer-to-peer.
02:38:50 So like you just make an HTML file and instead of having to go to Bluehost and pay X100 dollars,
02:38:56 it just hosts on your own local system.
02:38:59 So like that financial cost of having to host a website is gone.
02:39:03 So then like it's still harder than social, but like you don't have to like pay a year
02:39:09 up front of hosting space and keep paying every year.
02:39:12 It's just like a torn and it just runs on your computer.
02:39:14 I think that's super powerful and really interesting.
02:39:19 You know, if I could bring up just one more fast, I was just thinking about this.
02:39:23 I'm thinking about the experience of being a YouTuber to kind of go back to that side
02:39:28 of things.
02:39:29 And I've been thinking about this for a while and it's that so maybe I've been a little
02:39:33 bit charmed by listening to so much Joe Rogan, he has a lot of comedians and they like talk
02:39:38 about their experiences and it sounds really nice because as a YouTuber, even working towards
02:39:44 being more of a YouTuber and putting more videos out, it's real.
02:39:47 I don't mean to be disrespectful to anybody, but I do actually kind of feel like a whore
02:39:53 in some ways.
02:39:55 Yeah, to a degree because like here I am, I'm selling like my inner self to a degree,
02:40:01 you know.
02:40:02 And like when I think about like podcasts are definitely there's an element of that
02:40:07 there for sure.
02:40:08 Like we Agua again, there's an element of that there and I compare that to like a practiced
02:40:15 routine of a stand up comic.
02:40:18 Like yes, you're going there, you're like doing your thing.
02:40:20 But what you're actually selling is like it's a product.
02:40:24 It's not literally like your soul being like removed from it's something that you've prepared
02:40:29 to distribute as opposed to like being like a daily vlogger and like to turn your whole
02:40:34 life into that.
02:40:36 I want a big, thick old wall between me and like the people who I, you know, sell content
02:40:43 to essentially and because I'm I really don't want to have that kind of barrier be like
02:40:49 thin.
02:40:50 I like having my my life, my private shit going on and it does make me a little uncomfortable
02:40:55 sometimes exposing a lot of my inner self sucks that you really can't have that wall
02:41:02 as much as you want.
02:41:03 You have to have a Patreon and in order to sell the Patreon, you have to have a Discord
02:41:07 server and in order to how different are we from like, I don't know, like Instagram
02:41:11 thoughts or whatever, who are selling their like private Snapchats.
02:41:14 Like in their case, they're selling like literal pictures of their bodies.
02:41:18 At least they're not selling their like inner thoughts, you know, they get to keep that
02:41:21 shit private.
02:41:22 And I I'm just saying that's a different sort of feeling, but there's probably something
02:41:25 enjoyable about that.
02:41:26 Now I'm not trying to like exaggerate and be like, oh my God, what was me?
02:41:29 This is so terrible.
02:41:30 It's just it's just a vague sense that I've been having and I don't know.
02:41:35 Let me know what you think of the comments down below.
02:41:37 Please like comment and subscribe, ring that bell and sub for so and sub for so but I'm
02:41:43 not only use up.
02:41:44 I'm gonna let's sub for so but like the part where only you subscribe.
02:41:48 Let's do that.
02:41:49 That sounds right.
02:41:50 That's right.
02:41:51 That's right.
02:41:52 That's the way to do it.
02:41:53 That's the way to sub for so we got one more question real quick.
02:41:56 We are we are we are going in towards our last question.
02:42:00 Here and and we will wrap it up.
02:42:03 So this is from bad rap.
02:42:06 Joe.
02:42:07 Give it to us.
02:42:10 Soundcraft hero.
02:42:11 Here you go.
02:42:12 Hey, yo, it's me, the biggest piece of shit you ever did see open your mouth and let me
02:42:17 take a pee.
02:42:18 Don't work by the charge.
02:42:19 It's full free.
02:42:20 I like to stick my fingers on my ass just for fun.
02:42:22 So you better run.
02:42:23 I'm about to paint balls with my cum push my prostate with my thumb.
02:42:28 Boom.
02:42:29 Wow.
02:42:30 I'm the king.
02:42:31 Fuck with me.
02:42:32 And I'll knock out the ringing.
02:42:33 I don't play fair.
02:42:34 Kick your nuts and pull out your hair shut on your chest without care.
02:42:37 More like a bear.
02:42:38 So you better be aware.
02:42:39 I swear to be worse.
02:42:40 The wear and I take it down to my layer and tear off the skin and begin to touch myself.
02:42:43 Rip off your fingers.
02:42:44 Put them on my shelf.
02:42:45 That's it.
02:42:46 Yeah.
02:42:47 I'm I'm really like the Donkey Kong review.
02:42:51 Okay.
02:42:52 So far.
02:42:53 Yeah.
02:42:54 The new rap is on point.
02:42:57 That was a great follow up to that whole discussion we just had.
02:43:02 Yeah.
02:43:03 It was.
02:43:04 This guy.
02:43:06 This guy is selling his innermost stuff.
02:43:07 He really is.
02:43:08 That was a wonderful bad rap, Joe.
02:43:10 What a what a note to end the podcast.
02:43:12 I think there's no need for comment.
02:43:14 Let's just end it right there.
