00:00:00 Hey everyone, welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm here to
00:00:14 talk about a big problem, hegemonic masculinity. Here to weigh in, we've got Nate Best Guy
00:00:24 Ever-Bestman. Yeah, I'm like Edward Scissorhands. I hate hedge cutting masculinity, you know?
00:00:33 Fuck, okay, cancelled. We've got Tom Oliver. Look, I just do what my dick tells me to do.
00:00:39 It's good, it's bad, it doesn't matter. It's the boss and I know where I stand in the packing
00:00:43 order. Arrest this man. The pecker order, you might say. And finally, we've got Lethal Aurora
00:00:50 Mage. Completely unrelated to the topic, Pokemon. I'm glad to hear you're an ally. I'm going to poke
00:00:57 your mom, Mage, because I'm a bad toxic male. Pokemon is gay coded, I'd say. Queer coded. Hey guys,
00:01:03 I have an announcement. I have a big announcement to make right now. All right, go, go, go. My
00:01:09 Kickstarter is launching right now. Hooray! Maple is two physical copies available right now on
00:01:16 Kickstarter. Link in the description. I don't have, as I record, I have not actually made the
00:01:22 website, so I can't say it out loud, but it's real. Damn it, it's real. It's real in the future
00:01:28 when they're listening to this, not right now, correct? I can't go right now, but I can when this
00:01:34 is live in the future. Yes, on Friday at 2 p.m. or whatever, release these. Yes, at that point,
00:01:40 the page will be up and the suffering will begin. Deb, Deb, Deb. Now, I'd very much like to have
00:01:48 physical copies of all the vapor chapters, but what can I expect as a fan for new content? Is it
00:01:53 vaporettes? Here's the thing. There's going to be like, there's going to be, unless any of my,
00:01:59 the artist that got lined up, drop out, I'm going to, it's going to have, this is going to have six new,
00:02:04 six new, fully new vaporettes. They are canon. I wrote them. They're being drawn by guest
00:02:10 artists, but I wrote them. They're canon. We're probably actually going to be more new content
00:02:16 than old content, actually. And we're going, we're going deep. We're going deep diving. Guess what?
00:02:23 You're going to meet, you're going to meet Vincent and Magda's parents. You fuckers. Oh my god.
00:02:27 That's exciting. Yeah, they're in there. Yeah, they're in there. We can find out who's responsible
00:02:32 for these fucking delinquents. Yeah, there's some fucking shit in there. Okay. There's some
00:02:38 fucking shit. You're going to, you're going to feel real fucking bad when you read this
00:02:43 shit. You piece of, you fucker. Don't see that. That's actually pretty interesting because that's
00:02:49 like an important part of your character's kind of like development is like reveal these characters
00:02:56 and, and you're not even drawing it. You know, you've outsourced a very big kind of like,
00:03:00 I would say plot point, but that's kind of cool. Well, I made, um, well, I did some like concept
00:03:05 sketches, not just for parents. Like there's other things like, like if a particular thing
00:03:10 factors into a story, I'll draw it out and be like, here's what this looks like or something. So
00:03:14 like I did like design stuff, but like, I mean, I don't really care. I don't feel any less like,
00:03:20 I don't feel like divorced from it at all. If like someone else draws, I think that's cool. I think
00:03:24 that's cool that I can get my ideas represented in another person's style. And I'm, and I, and by
00:03:30 the way, um, I'm giving all the guest artists a cut. I'm giving, like, you know, I got six of them.
00:03:35 So I'm giving everyone as a cut. Every, my deal is with them all that every chapter, every copy
00:03:41 of Vapors two that sells, I'm going to give them 50 cents. So last time I moved about 200 copies.
00:03:47 So that would be like a hundred bucks. If I did really well, it would be even more. So Ben, Ben
00:03:52 same, putting his money where his mouth is and giving his artists the Vapors dividend.
00:03:56 Yeah. Yeah. Dab. Yeah. Uh, uh, uh, workers, workers of the workers of the world tonight.
00:04:03 Everyone's, we got, you got mutual ownership here. Right. We got a worker, a little workers co-op
00:04:08 going on right here. We got to mutually, we mutually own the means of production.
00:04:12 But you know, whenever I work with anybody, I make sure that they are financially compensated
00:04:17 or else I wouldn't possibly expect them to do it. I didn't, uh, funny, funny thing. All these guys,
00:04:23 like they're not all, all these guys like just asked me if they could do it and said they wanted
00:04:28 to do it like for free. And I was like, yeah, okay. And I was like, wait a minute, I should probably
00:04:33 pay them. I should probably also pay them something. You know, I, from a purely, that's just an art
00:04:38 me too waiting to happen. If it gets out, you don't have any of these artists being paid because
00:04:43 there's nothing that an artist gets mad about more than unpaid work. I mean, how many times have,
00:04:48 you know, we like shit on like guys like Dr. Wolf and KP for, you know, exactly. I didn't want to
00:04:53 be, I did not want to be a Dr. Wolf. Like I, I guaranteed those people came to them and were
00:04:58 like, Hey man, can we edit for you? They develop a rhythm. And then at a certain point they're
00:05:02 like, Hey, shouldn't I be getting paid for this? Even though I, I mean it, I can't imagine that
00:05:07 Dr. Wolf, for example, would willingly take advantage of anyone's labor. I'm sure he just
00:05:11 bumbles into it due to, you know, whatever free shit that people just offer to him. This is my
00:05:17 guess anyway. Maybe he's a master manipulator. Who can say he's a wily one? You know, I gotta say,
00:05:22 I was going over, like I was deciding on how much I was going to set the goal at this, this time. I
00:05:27 was going over the expenses from last time and they were like, they were like almost double what I
00:05:31 thought. Like it cost almost twice as much to do. Like I, my initial goal was like 1750. I think
00:05:38 the actual amount of just like, you know, initial Kickstarter fees plus like postage plus initial
00:05:45 printing plus like making the pay. It all came to like, like 2,800 or something. So like almost
00:05:50 half like the whole thing. Well, it was Ben. It was a real, it was a real, oh, and shipping,
00:05:54 God, international shipping fucking killed me. This time I am going to have to add like an
00:05:58 international shipping charge just because last time international shipping was so fucking bad.
00:06:02 With Digi about shipping shirts and stuff. And he was recommending stamps.com where you can get
00:06:08 highly discounted shipping through there instead of going through local traditional channels. So
00:06:14 that might be something to look into. I'll check it out. Is it really cheaper than just sending
00:06:18 with the he was able to ship the shirts that he's been doing for half the price that he was before.
00:06:24 So well, yeah, it seems like it might be worth looking into. I'll, I'll, I'll look into it and
00:06:30 see if that, if that, if that cuts any, any costs anywhere.
00:06:37 If you want to know more, watch that episode with me, me, Tom and Digi where half more than half
00:06:42 of the episode is about Digi talking about shipping. Oh, I didn't watch the Baronecon one.
00:06:47 Yeah. But maybe before the people are split on that, whether being it was a nice, cool,
00:06:51 calm reprieve from the normal PCP. The other half the audience like this is the most boring
00:06:56 shit I've ever heard in my life. Well, so you know what, at least it was, at least they can't
00:07:03 variety, you know, at least it was different. People aren't spoiled for choice at this point.
00:07:08 Thanks to me. Indeed, indeed. Speaking of, of financial curves and trying to get ahead of things,
00:07:14 this is very much on my mind as I'm embarking on my, my year long quest to be financially viable
00:07:21 long term and whatnot doing YouTube stuff. And I got to tell you guys, this, this last, I don't
00:07:26 know, couple of weeks or whatever, I have been like an animal with a taste of blood in its mouth.
00:07:32 I have been on the hunt. I have been the hunter in the field. Remember that guy in Jumanji that
00:07:36 like sick, like South African hunter guy who was chasing Robin Williams? Like that's me. That's me.
00:07:42 And, and my prey, and my prey is the most elusive prey, the most dangerous prey of all that I've
00:07:48 been pursuing. And it is a, a Huel sponsorship. Oh, my God. Okay. Right now. Are you,
00:07:55 bitch, are you for real? Well, okay. So tragically, I'm not for real.
00:08:03 As far as I know, I've been doing some research. I don't think that Huel has really done anything
00:08:09 like this before. So I've taken on myself to reach out to them and just say, Hey guys, talk to me.
00:08:15 I love your product. I would be, I would absolutely love to shill your shit online,
00:08:20 because I think it's so great and so good for the future of humanity. Let's make a
00:08:25 fucking deal where I can make a little pittance, shill your product and whatever, more people buy
00:08:30 your stuff. You have to do a we Agua on like Starfleet or something and then integrate your
00:08:34 Huel into that. Because what is more Starfleet than Huel? Well, that's, that's couldn't be more
00:08:39 accurate. But I mean, at the beginning of my last we Agua about the Tarantino movie,
00:08:43 once upon a time in Hollywood, I do like a little gag where I actually say like Huel,
00:08:47 sponsor me. I'm wearing Huel merch, drinking a Huel, saying Huel, I love your product,
00:08:52 please let me show for you. I need more Huel. I haven't gotten Huel in a fucking forever.
00:08:56 I just got my second batch of the, of like the bottle, you know, whatever bottle Huel. I just
00:09:01 had one for breakfast. The chocolate Huel bottles are so fucking good. I have not done the bottles
00:09:07 at all yet. Because they are, they're so much better than the powder. They are delicious. The
00:09:12 thing about the powder is it's annoying to make and honestly doesn't taste that great. The bottles
00:09:17 are so good. They are so good. But isn't it like a lot more expensive to get bottles? It is. That's
00:09:22 the doubt. It is more expensive. That's definitely true. But the question is, is it overall for life
00:09:28 still a better use of your money than like buying a sandwich, which I think the answer is yes. That's
00:09:33 what that's what I've said. I've worked at like between three and four dollars a bottle, which is
00:09:37 like 400 calories. Not cheap. By the way, how do I get to use my EBT on Huel? I'm making a healthy
00:09:43 choice. I have to go contact the government and be like, in a perfect world we'll be there. Maybe
00:09:47 you can find it in like a convenience store or something. I don't think they sell in retail
00:09:51 because they only sell direct to consumers right now. No, no. I swear I've seen like boxed like
00:09:56 Huel. Oh yeah? Maybe. I think so. It was in the same place that we saw the boxed water.
00:10:03 You know? Well, okay. Boxed water. That sounds great. Maybe I'm getting confused. I don't know.
00:10:10 Well, in any case, look, I just want to let people know that I'm not asking anybody to do
00:10:16 anything. But like if anyone knows about ways to get at this point, I have sent two salvos. I've
00:10:22 reached out twice to their support staff just saying, Hey guys, I make YouTube videos, look at
00:10:27 for a sponsorship with you guys. I think you're great. I think we'd be a great fit.
00:10:30 Work with it. Just let me know if you're even interested. So far, I've had no communication
00:10:37 back from them whatsoever, which is not a no. You're going about this the entirely wrong way.
00:10:44 This is what you need to do. You need to make a video on YouTube talking about this exact thing
00:10:48 you're saying right now. You want to get a sponsorship. And then you have to make a hashtag.
00:10:53 You have to put it on Twitter and you have to add Huel and get everyone to jump on the
00:10:58 hashtag. Get it trending and they'll have to acknowledge you. What do we got? What's a what's
00:11:02 a good hashtag? Hashtag. Heal it up. Hashtag. Hashtag. Huel Nate's heart. I don't know something
00:11:12 like that. You have to workshop that a bit, but we'll get there. I'm gonna like that one. That
00:11:17 was cute. Huel Nate's heart. Like I'm going for like a fuel Nate's heart kind of thing, but it's
00:11:22 Huel. Yeah. All right. Yeah. Okay. There you go. Hashtag. Huel Nate's heart. That's the one.
00:11:30 You're starting a social media campaign. Tell Huel you want me to sponsor their product
00:11:34 for reasonable compensation. That's what I'm all about. That's it. Hashtag. Fuck Huel. There you go.
00:11:44 They're doing God's work. So we mentioned Twitter briefly. I'm gonna go slightly off topic. Does
00:11:49 anyone know if Twitter still verifies people because I've heard it doesn't verify people anymore
00:11:54 or something? You know, I've looked into this a bit, Mage. And what I found at my last check was
00:11:59 that there used to be a process through which they would, in fact, like you could submit a form to
00:12:03 be verified. When I was interested in this a while back, when I looked into it, they said they have
00:12:09 shut down the application thing. So they're not like accepting applications or whatever. But when
00:12:14 they, they will still give out the badge to people that like they just like journalists to
00:12:19 like people who just are known and are recognized. And journalists is like the number one kind of
00:12:24 people who that just happens to when they're known and they do stuff, even people who don't have a
00:12:28 lot of followers or anything. So for us pleads, there's basically no hope. No, I wasn't, I was
00:12:33 giving it for me. I don't care about the take, but I'm following like this one Twitter account
00:12:37 that's been wanting to be verified for a while. We're talking about Satan. Are you talking about
00:12:41 Verify Satan? Yes, I am talking about Satan. How did you know? Because I saw this on the
00:12:47 Twitter. Is it just at Satan? Hashtag verify Satan. That's young Venus's dream is to get
00:12:54 verified on Twitter, but I guess it'll never happen. What a shit. Well, I like how Tom knows me enough.
00:13:03 I mean, what's their, what's their reason for not verifying people? I mean, I think it's because
00:13:08 like there, it seems like their standards for verification were like way inconsistent. Or
00:13:14 maybe they, like there are tiny accounts that are verified and there are like big accounts that
00:13:19 are not verified. It seems like verification is more at this point, not to be this is who you are,
00:13:25 but it's like you're involved with like the traditional media or something like that. It seems
00:13:30 like it's, it's like, yeah, it's not about this is who you are. It's about like, it's Twitter giving
00:13:37 you sort of like an endorsement. Yeah, it's our tacit pad on the head for everything. I mean,
00:13:41 the one, the biggest one was when they simply de-verified Miloianopolis and like we know that's
00:13:47 Milo's account. Like that's verified, but they just were like, no, we don't want to, we don't want
00:13:52 to be with this guy. So obviously that's not what it means. Yeah, anymore. That's true. Later on,
00:13:58 he did get banned. So yeah, that was, that was a separate incident though. Yeah, well, I don't know.
00:14:04 Good luck, Satan. I wish you all the luck on your quest to get verified. Shout out to Satan for
00:14:09 giving us the knowledge of good and evil. It's really enabled everything. It was kind of a good
00:14:13 thing. It was kind of a help. In any other story, Satan would be the hero. Think about it. You're
00:14:19 in this post post apocalyptic dystopia and some heroes. This is my story.
00:14:27 Satan is punishing the sinners. He's not evil himself. He's like, he's being the jailer.
00:14:32 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's just running a for-profit private prison. What could possibly be wrong
00:14:38 with that? That's why we need Bernie. That's why we need Bernie to get in there and bust that
00:14:41 cell. But we're already feeling the burn. Satan's got fire and brimstone. We don't need Bernie.
00:14:45 It's the wrong kind of burn, okay? It's the wrong kind, all right? It's not exactly what I was thinking.
00:14:51 It's just, it's just too slow of a burn. Eternity is too slow of a burn. We need something quicker
00:14:55 and faster. We change now. That's why we need Bernie. God, this just makes me think. I've been
00:14:59 watching this YouTube channel. I think Jesse might have complained about this YouTube channel
00:15:04 called Renegade Cuts the other week, and I didn't know what it was talking about.
00:15:09 I didn't know what he was talking about, so I couldn't comment. But I started watching it,
00:15:14 and it's great. It's great. It's just my shit. It's my vaguely lefty media analysis in the
00:15:22 vein of Big Joel or whatever. It's one of those. It's really good. But in particular,
00:15:29 what this guy Renegade Cuts is good at is, I think he was raised very Catholic. He was an
00:15:34 altar boy and stuff. He's got insight. He's got insight into the evangelical mindset. He has one
00:15:42 video that I particularly recommend on the, oh fuck, what's it called? That movie in books
00:15:48 left behind. The ones about the rapture people living in the post-rapture thing.
00:15:54 He goes into a deep dive. I knew about some of this rapture mythology stuff, but I didn't know.
00:16:02 He throws out terms like post-millennial dispensationalism and stuff to describe what's
00:16:07 going on here in terms of the philosophy at play. It's great shit. It's great shit.
00:16:13 What is dispensationalism? Okay. Oh, I didn't know this, but apparently
00:16:19 a dispensation in some... It's a payment, right?
00:16:24 In this context, what it means is a period of time, is a dispensation. The time when Adam and
00:16:30 Eve lived in the garden before the fall was a dispensation, and then the time before the flood
00:16:35 was another dispensation. Currently, we are living in a particular dispensation that has been going
00:16:41 on since the resurrection of Jesus, and then what is... An era, an age, something like that.
00:16:47 Yeah, an era and age. Not all of them are specific to this, but a lot of rapture theology
00:16:55 evangelicals have a particular view of eschatology called post-millennial dispensationalism,
00:17:03 which says that we are currently living in a long dispensation, but there will be the rapture,
00:17:09 and then there will be the millennia, which is a thousand-year reign of Jesus Christ, followed
00:17:13 by the judgment, and the return of heaven on earth, which is the post-millennial dispensation
00:17:21 that is when the judgment happens. It's something along those lines, and anyway, Renegade cuts
00:17:27 this really good, and he talks about that kind of stuff, and I love that shit. Well, all right,
00:17:31 cool. He doesn't only talk about that, but a significant chunk of his videos are about
00:17:37 movies left behind and other Christian propaganda kind of things. I forget the name of the guy,
00:17:45 but Michelle was Mormon for a while when she was young, which is basically a cult. It's just a cult.
00:17:52 It's weird. There are some YouTubers that pop up. There's a little sub-genre of former religious
00:17:59 people. It sounds like this guy is one, and there's these former Mormon guys. I can't remember the
00:18:04 guy's name specifically, but there's one guy. I think it was actually Mr. Atheist. I think that was
00:18:08 his name, and Michelle was saying for a while that she was watching his stuff, but after a while,
00:18:17 it just became like, here I am, not still not Mormon, still wishing I hadn't done that back in
00:18:26 the day. That can't be your whole thing. Well, it's got to change at some point. You don't want
00:18:31 to be a springboard or something with more meat on its bones.
00:18:37 Michelle was telling me about, there are these channels that get huge off of specifically
00:18:42 like Acne. They're like Acne channels, and they're about someone's journey to get rid of their Acne,
00:18:48 so they start off looking pretty rough, and they try, I forget, like Accutane or some of the
00:18:54 procedures. Because people are like, oh, I've got Acne. Would this work for me?
00:18:59 Well, they do this for weight loss, right? They do weight loss journey channels too.
00:19:03 Yes, that kind of shit too. And the thing is, oftentimes they can succeed, but in doing so,
00:19:09 they develop a pretty sizable following. I saw some people with over like 150,000 subs just off
00:19:14 of an Acne journey, but then it's like, well now what? You're done. The quest is over. You lost the
00:19:20 weight. Yeah. Good job. I think there was something like that, like a channel about a woman trying to
00:19:25 lose her weight, but she ended up like binge eating and just becoming. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's
00:19:31 right. I know. I don't know what I know. Well, there's, oh God, I saw a video about this, and it was
00:19:36 like people, it was talking about how people love to hate on these people and to like, and to like
00:19:41 law, like if someone, yeah, there's one, there's one particular channel that is like well known
00:19:47 for this, but it's not the only one, but it's like a weight loss journey where like, based on what
00:19:52 the video contents, you can tell that like they're not doing it. They're failing, right? And they're
00:19:57 like making excuses for themselves and people like, and people like to watch these and do reaction
00:20:01 videos pointing out like, oh, look, like, look how dishonest this person is being. Like, look how
00:20:06 this person's fucking up. You know, it's kind of like a there, but for the grace of God. That's
00:20:12 the internet for you, I guess. Yeah. I know the channel you're talking about, but I don't remember
00:20:16 its name. Yeah, I only heard about it like. Like how long, how long can you milk the idea
00:20:22 that you are on a weight loss journey when like it's been years and like you weigh the same?
00:20:26 I think at this point, it might be like some sort of psychological dependency on the attention
00:20:31 for the female, I think. It's not, it's not quite the same. Well, it reminds me of Boogie,
00:20:35 right? Like Boogie had that like gastric bypass surgery and he went down from like 500 to like
00:20:40 300 pounds and then. That's pretty good. Well, yeah. I mean, it's, it could be better, right?
00:20:46 Sure, of course. But he's like, he's still, man. I mean, 40% weight loss is pretty damn good.
00:20:53 Yeah, well, when you have gastric bypass, of course you're going to have that, right? But then
00:20:57 he's still, he's still morbidly obese, right? But like, I don't know, I saw a video, there's this
00:21:03 one pretty, pretty well known video about like, what's, what the fuck's wrong with Boogie? Just
00:21:08 like what an asshole he is. And he does seem like a big asshole. But in particular, there's people
00:21:13 that have made like really good faith attempts to be like, hey, Boogie, here's what I think is
00:21:18 going wrong on your weight loss journey. And here's how I think you can fix it. And he's responded
00:21:22 with like great hostility, like a totally inappropriate sense of like, I'm being victimized.
00:21:28 Well, well, look, after, I mean, you know me, Nate is hardcore hashtag kill the fats. But,
00:21:34 but aside from that, when you've like, obviously people have been telling Boogie like, I'm sure
00:21:39 great advice for like years and years. And it's absolutely sure true that he should have taken
00:21:46 most or all of that advice and fix his problem, which is fixable. But there's like, I mean,
00:21:51 he's got like, like mental like abuse, any like comfort eats, because he's so traumatized,
00:21:55 but like his fucked up childhood, I just don't know. I mean, I'm not impressed, but I mean,
00:22:00 we've all got our reasons why we fuck up.
00:22:06 He's been like, like for years on the internet, known a person like, and imagine like,
00:22:11 constantly getting this unsolicited advice, it would probably great on your nerves too.
00:22:16 Okay, all right. God damn it. All right, I know you guys are all you guys are all
00:22:20 we love Boogie. And we love the idea. I know the defense of this guy. Let me tell you this.
00:22:27 Okay, I wouldn't complain except that Boogie has like, he sort of like has made part, he too kind
00:22:32 of made part of his appeal, this like weight loss journey thing. And he's like, he's very cagey about
00:22:37 it. He'll make, he'll make promises. And then he'll like, I know that like, I know that like, to a
00:22:42 certain extent, it's none of his, it wouldn't be his audience's business. If he didn't talk publicly
00:22:47 about it. Yeah, yeah, I mean, I kind of wish he wouldn't make it his audiences. It seems like a bad
00:22:54 incentive structure to make it your audience's business. Your, your especially when you say,
00:22:58 I've got psychological issues. This is not going to be easy for me. You know, blah, blah, blah,
00:23:03 my whole that that just that's like a private thing, man. I don't know why you'd
00:23:07 to be fair. I like, I don't know much about Boogie like at all. Yeah. I've known people say that
00:23:12 he's a nice person in general. That's all I've heard of him. And now I'm hearing this, you know,
00:23:18 I'm not believing either side, honestly. So I don't know. I don't care. Well, this video,
00:23:23 this video, there's a video called the fall of Boogie 2988, why he's losing subscribers that
00:23:28 has 2 million, 2.5 million views right now. Is that by that guy, Tom, something? Oliver? Yes.
00:23:38 2.5 million Tom, congratulations. Yeah, you know, that's, that's pretty good. I finally came.
00:23:43 It was like, I got to get into the blood sports is the only way to make this world.
00:23:45 You must be raking in the dough. Oh, yeah, I have like seven whole dollars in my AdSense.
00:23:51 I'm so stuck. Have we talked about how the Sonichu lecture is closing in on 100,000,
00:23:59 not 100,000, closing in on a million. It's about 100,000 away from hitting a million.
00:24:04 It's up here and there, but that should be noted. That's that's pretty amazing. Do you think it's
00:24:07 going to see like, well, let's see like a second wind, right? Like, I think back in the day,
00:24:12 Digi said that like, when his, when his old anime videos hit like a million views,
00:24:16 they would sometimes get like a second wind and get like a new wave of like people watching.
00:24:20 I would be surprised. I mean, that's like an algorithm question. I don't know, man,
00:24:23 I am no fucking expert on this shit. I have no idea what made like my Galco video. My Galco
00:24:29 video had like waves. I think that was just because people would like post it on Tumblr and
00:24:33 they'd be like, oh, let's go watch the video. It wasn't a huge wave, but like the past like two
00:24:38 weeks or so, I don't know why. Like viewership on the Sonichu lecture was like double what it usually
00:24:45 is. I don't know. Just just happened. And then it went kind of just drifted back down against
00:24:50 a normal and yeah, I don't know, man. Let me see. Let me see. How's it doing right now? How's this
00:24:55 shit doing right now? Um, YouTube YouTube studio beta. Show me show me the analytics. Show me.
00:25:01 Beta. Okay. Yeah, I went back. It went it's gone back down to about normal. The typical like 1200
00:25:08 views a day or so. Yeah, for a while it was doing like 1900, 1800 a day. I think I think just just
00:25:14 for a very distinct little period there. If Sonichu does something, you know, that that makes them
00:25:21 trend, your video will probably get some. Yeah, Sonichu goes out there. You gotta dig deep. You
00:25:26 gotta go to your last 30 days and then you gotta see where external traffic's coming from. See if
00:25:30 like maybe go post it on Reddit or something. Some traffic increase source. It sounds crazy.
00:25:37 And yet there is a Sonichu currently living among us in the real world, right? Yeah. No. Yeah. Yeah.
00:25:45 One has crossed over the dimension. One has torn through the dimensional veil and is currently
00:25:50 has come over from C197 and has come over to one to two dimension one two one eight specifically
00:25:57 Well, because well, because you said if Sonichu does something and the thing is there currently is
00:26:02 a Sonichu in our domain. They're not supposed to exist in our dimension. They're from
00:26:05 they're from university one nine seven. But one of them has crossed. Magi Chan Sonichu has crossed
00:26:10 the dimensional barrier guys. Magi Chan Sonichu has come but not bodily mentally has entered
00:26:17 the body of Christine Weston Chandler and is currently living. He's possessed right now.
00:26:20 And tweet. Yes. Currently living and tweeting in our dimension. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
00:26:27 And Sonichu himself. Right now. Is this a possession or is this like a head made multiple
00:26:35 system kind of deal? I believe that they have swapped bodies. Yeah, that's right. Whoa. That's
00:26:43 what I heard. Jesus Christ. Well, tomato tomato. It's not the same thing. The result is the same.
00:26:49 If you swap body, that means your mind. Two minds have swapped between bodies.
00:26:55 Okay, we understand the idea as in as in Christine is currently in 1218 and and Magi Chan Sonichu
00:27:02 is currently here. And the thing that's scary thing about that is that Magi Chan Sonichu is
00:27:07 all powerful, right? We should we should all be fucking terrified right now because Magi Chan
00:27:12 Sonichu contains within him the ability to bait the fuck up everything. I had heard that
00:27:18 completely obliterate our entire time. But does magic magic and retain that ability in the body
00:27:23 of I heard Magi Chan is having difficulties using his psychic powers in Christine's body.
00:27:29 This is what I heard. You know what? It's it's not out of the realm of possibility that maybe Magi
00:27:35 Chan's power only one of us was a fucking Christian and could dig into this deep for us and do an
00:27:40 addendum to a almost million viewed video. I mean, there's there's no there's no precedent.
00:27:46 There's no precedent for this, right? We are in a bold new era, right? The dimensional merge is
00:27:50 happening and this is its harbinger. It's happening. You know, this is like remember those guys,
00:27:54 those like, uh, yeah, I mean, you know, end times, judgment day guys are like, guys, I'm telling you
00:27:59 like August 8th, 2012, it's happening. That's the date of the apocalypse. I really would. Did you
00:28:05 see did you see the internet historian video because I saw the internet historian? I certainly
00:28:10 did, man. I certainly did. And I was one of my favorite YouTubers in the historian.
00:28:16 Just make such high quality stuff. But in any case, hey, my alarms shout out to internet historian
00:28:22 if he's listening. A big old fat shout out to historian. Give us give us give us a give us a
00:28:27 plug. Give us a plug lads. Give us a subscribe to like patron $5 for bonus episodes, you know.
00:28:36 Hey, speaking, speaking of these devil tongues and these devilish activities.
00:28:42 I've got some shit I'm going to write down so I don't forget to mention it.
00:28:46 Okay, go ahead. Write it down. Okay. Well, I've got, I've got a truly devilish
00:28:52 point I wish to raise at some point. Speaking of, we were talking about Satan. We're talking about
00:28:57 hell. We're talking about the dimensional merge and all of these things culminate recently in,
00:29:02 in just, uh, let me say in four simple notes. Da, da, da, da. Yeah.
00:29:11 It's in Smash Bros. I saw it. I saw it live. It's really, it's pretty fun. It's so funny
00:29:18 because me and my friend were watching direct together. Well, not together. She was watching
00:29:21 in her house me and we were talking to each other on Discord and you know, I said, you know,
00:29:27 wouldn't it be funny if like sans got announced in Smash? This is as much
00:29:31 I mean people have been nemen about it for over a year now. Yeah. I just like, I was like, imagine
00:29:37 the pandemonium of the internet of sans got announced. I didn't, I said it in the tongue that
00:29:43 I didn't expect it to have Terry Bogart that apparently like South Americans or Mexicans
00:29:48 like love obsessively love King of Fighters totally overshadowed by sans and one song mega
00:29:54 Louvania getting into, into the new game. It's, uh, I mean, I don't really know much about Terry,
00:30:00 so I can't really speak on that. He just seems like another kind of boring fighter character.
00:30:03 And that's right. Roast me in the comments. Yeah. I literally don't know anything about
00:30:08 Terry, but where can I marry him? He is a very handsome man. Did you hear the cool, the cool,
00:30:13 the interesting thing? All the Japanese fans of Smash are saying that Terry's just a jacked
00:30:18 Pokemon trainer. Oh, I saw, I saw the meme. I saw the meme and I'm like, Ness is like the
00:30:24 base form than the, the Pokemon trainer is the middle evolution and then Terry is like the
00:30:28 final evolution. Do you think that, that Pokemon trainer and Terry walk down, they see each other
00:30:34 and they point and they go, same hat. Have you seen, have you seen the, the fatal cutie
00:30:41 fem swapped Terry Bogart? No. Is that a thing? You're about to. So get ready for that. Oh,
00:30:46 is it in the show notes? I'm posting it right now. This is like official art from like one of the
00:30:51 recent games or something. Okay. In gross discussing audio links. Okay. There you go. Okay. That is
00:30:57 awesome. Yeah. Oh, supposed to devolution. All right. It's about what I expected. Yeah. I mean,
00:31:01 it is what it is, but this is, I mean, this should be the one of the, one of the character
00:31:06 model swaps for Terry. That's his echo fighter. Oh, that'd be great. That'd be great.
00:31:13 And Terry's fucking cool though. I hope they do. I hope if you fight, if you fight,
00:31:19 fucking Ken, they bring back that SNK toss, fucking legendary. It's so cool. It's so cool.
00:31:27 I heard other people, they're just saying Terry is just Ken with hat and that's, you know,
00:31:32 pretty accurate. Since we were talking about sounds, Toby Fox was like made music for Game
00:31:38 Freak's game. Yeah. Toby Fox is a chat now. Yeah. For Game Freak. What game for Game Freak?
00:31:45 Their new game Town or was it Little Town Hero or the fuck it's called? Yeah, that's the one.
00:31:49 He's making the music for it, which means the music is going to be pretty great. Yeah. And also,
00:31:54 this was another one of the big things. Did you guys fucking hear, you brought me to,
00:31:58 probably did you watch it, that he went to Sakurai's house and he played Smash Bros.
00:32:04 Like he's just become, let's just, let's not forget people. Fucking Undertale Man,
00:32:09 fucking Toby Fox has made one fucking video game. He's made one video game. He made two games.
00:32:15 And as a result, Delta Rune is a demo. It is a demo for a game. It does not count. It's basically
00:32:20 a chapter release of it. Well, then I guess we should count his fucking ROM hack for Earthbound
00:32:25 2, but the point is it's not a complete game. No, that's sort of, that's great. Exactly. He's
00:32:31 okay. I'd say his total games add up to maybe like 1.85 games. Okay, fine. I'm rounding a hard
00:32:37 down to one. This fucking guy made one fucking video game. And he's literally like the prince
00:32:45 of the game industry, like Kojima and Sakurai and I don't know. When's he going to get me too?
00:32:51 It's only a matter of time. Toby, he's too private. He doesn't do anything. I don't know. Maybe he
00:32:56 is out there smashing Japanese puts right now. It's, he's just, he's living like the literal
00:33:01 drip. He was making Undertale in fucking Andrew Hussie's basement, literally, and was just living
00:33:07 like a fucking cockroach parasite piece of shit. He makes his fucking demos like the best game
00:33:12 demo ever. There's hope for us yet. I just, I can't believe the meteoric rise that this one guy has
00:33:19 had. It's inspiring, honestly. All right. And fucking Hussie has got to be on Suicide Watch right
00:33:25 now. Seeing how Huss out just makes me roll my eyes. This is bullshit. What's bullshit? It's
00:33:30 bullshit. It's all bullshit. Toby Fox? Toby Fox, you know, whatever. So he likes to do a really good
00:33:35 video game idea that everyone loved. Oh, great. Is he so much better than the rest of us? No.
00:33:40 No one's saying he's better. It's just incredible. He's fine. He's fine. Yeah. The dude made a
00:33:45 fucking sick product and he's, yeah, he made a pretty big product. All the accolades for it.
00:33:51 He made a pretty good product. He's living the way you do. Good for him. Good for him.
00:33:56 Like, Toby did not, Toby did not predict the mimetic rise of Undertale. It's almost baffling
00:34:03 to me to realize that, like, wow, a lot of these guys have not actually put in the amount of time
00:34:08 or, like, even played Undertale, but they just love the Saiyans' memes and they love, you know,
00:34:13 megalovania and those are crazy popular memes and stuff. It's weird for me to think that these
00:34:18 people don't actually appreciate the actual game as much as they should, but it is like one of the
00:34:23 better. It's still. Normies don't appreciate art. It do be like that sometimes. It do. It truly do,
00:34:29 but the megalovania is in Smash Bros. I cannot fucking believe it. Its original usage was in
00:34:37 the ROM hack as the final boss theme of his, like, Halloween earthbound fucking thing. It's all, like,
00:34:42 all comes back. It started with Nintendo, ended with Nintendo. It's incredible. It's fucking
00:34:47 incredible. What a journey. What a legend. What a god. What an inspiration. I feel supreme jealousy
00:34:54 and I also feel. I'm happy for him. I'm genuinely happy for him. Let's end Nintendo. Let's get,
00:35:03 like, Sakurai and Kojima. Let's put them in Toby's shoes and see what they can make in his
00:35:12 shoes, right? Like, let's take our big developers that have, like, a big corporate backing behind
00:35:17 them, you know, obliterate them and put them in Andrew Hussie's basement and say, all right,
00:35:22 what can you do? Huh? Well, you just gotta go back to their early career. That's a fair question.
00:35:28 Toby, I mean, look at the, like, everything in Undertale is extremely simple. Like, the gameplay,
00:35:33 it's just like moving around a keyboard. It obviously doesn't look amazing. I mean, the art's good
00:35:37 for what it is, but it's a very, obviously, you know, the product of a couple of people. It was
00:35:40 styled back and scaled to be appropriate for the man. It's just that the ideas that he did work
00:35:45 with, like the whole resetting, remembering things that happen, like the different timelines, the
00:35:51 amazing way that you can write with genocide or pacifist or whatever. That's all you need. Like,
00:35:55 that's the good shit. That's that's the shit that makes it. It had a great hook that the rest of the
00:35:59 game never quite lived up to. I disagree. But the time the time shenanigans were never quite as good
00:36:06 as they were in the Toriel fight. I agree. That was the purest concentration. Is this a hot take
00:36:13 that I feel like the Toriel fight promised more to, like, sort of implied that there would be more
00:36:19 to the timelines thing later on and it never really even got as good as that ever again?
00:36:24 You know, Ben, I would totally agree that within within like the demo, the Toriel demo,
00:36:30 like it is like basically it's the perfect packaged way to show off how that mechanic works.
00:36:36 And like so it's true, like the game is so much longer. It's the single best instance of it.
00:36:42 It's because like you're not that far in a game that you wouldn't feel sorry about resetting the
00:36:47 game. You know, like once you're further in the game, I might as well stick with what I have.
00:36:50 Well, it just takes more commitment. Well, another thing I played that game like five times.
00:36:54 Another thing to keep in mind with this is that like the Toriel fight was the demo and that was
00:37:00 like what like a year removed from the full game. So you play through the demo and you have like
00:37:04 365 days of being excited for this game and imagining all the ways it could make you could
00:37:09 play with this concept. But I feel like if there was no undertale demo, I don't think the Toriel
00:37:14 fight would be as impact not as impactful, but like it wouldn't be such a huge like schism,
00:37:20 you know, it would just be another part of the game. I think giving that year to just kind of
00:37:24 ruminate on what that implied for the rest of the game makes it stand out for that.
00:37:28 If you if we'd been given the whole game, we would not appreciate the Toriel bit as much.
00:37:32 I never played the demo despite vents and systems at that point.
00:37:35 I did. Yeah, I had that. My friend showed me the demo a couple months, a couple months before
00:37:40 the game itself came out, and I was pretty excited about it. Yeah, like,
00:37:45 yeah, that bit like, I mean, maybe, maybe it is, I think it did because because it was just a demo,
00:37:50 like you had the chance to like play it through a couple times and it was short. And like, yeah,
00:37:53 you got to experience like, oh my god, this this, it like it under it knows what's going on
00:37:59 of it, like adjust and like it knows what you're going to do. And it is like dynamic, dynamically
00:38:03 responds to your fucking around with the save states. That's pretty neat. And then in the real
00:38:07 game, it's like, yeah, we did it once. Well, okay, that that's where you're exaggerating a bit,
00:38:13 because I don't think I am. Well, well, a little bit late. Like, there are a couple of moments
00:38:19 when the game will be aware that like you previously saved and had a game over and restarted.
00:38:25 Well, I totally agree. That's the same gimmick again. Basically, everything that happens between
00:38:30 the toriel thing and the very end, when you do all the finale stuff, kind of doesn't really matter
00:38:35 towards this particular point of the resetting stuff. And it's all funny and humor, blah, blah,
00:38:40 blah. But on this point, which we all know is the best part of Undertale, mechanically and like
00:38:43 story wise and whatnot and game design wise. The it's the fact that you can do these pacifist
00:38:49 and genocide endings. And like that only in very specific ones do you get the ultimate super epic
00:38:55 boss fight against sans. And then that's doing the genocide ending. That's not that innovative.
00:38:59 That's not the end of my point, though, because the end of the point is that even after doing
00:39:07 the genocide ending, and you literally destroy the world and whatnot, you can't I mean, I talk
00:39:12 about this in my in my undertale video. But I'm just restating the point from that. But it's that
00:39:16 you can do that ending. We know the game is teaching us there have been consequences to our
00:39:20 actions and everything, including the toriel thing at the beginning. And you do genocide,
00:39:24 you destroy the world. But then the game gives you the ability to reset. It's that whole thing.
00:39:30 And then you play through the game again, you can do a pacifist ending. But your but that's when
00:39:35 you get the true final thing is after that extra play through, when it turns out the char is still
00:39:40 evil. It's like, oh, it's making a larger point. I get yes. Okay, okay, I guess I guess it's true
00:39:46 that that is sort of the same thing on the scale of the entire game. And that is pretty cool.
00:39:52 But I agree. That's over like a 20 30 hour experience as opposed to like a one hour experience.
00:39:57 But I mean, it's the amount of content what you're just you're what you're describing is literally
00:40:02 like the addition of like a two second moment. I don't think it's a good moment. It's a really
00:40:07 good moment. I think that's the point though. It's it takes that entire slow burn of playing
00:40:12 the game multiple times to like have that hit home. You're like, oh, okay, I mean, I don't think
00:40:18 that that's how I mean, that is a great thing. It is a great moment in the game. And it talked to you
00:40:23 when you did when you were recording the game, you did you were recording or it's like, haha,
00:40:27 look at those fools watching your recording. You're no better than playing the game. Yeah.
00:40:32 There were those bits about like, even the people who watch let's plays and stuff, they're just as
00:40:36 bad. They're just for years to the side. Yeah, okay. I mean, that's not cool. That's a different
00:40:40 point. Yeah. And it's funny. And it's but it's not like it doesn't blow my mind or anything like that
00:40:44 point. I haven't seen it done before. And I like when I think it's fair to say that Undertale,
00:40:51 the whole game, the tutorial, it's I absolutely agree. Ben, everyone should have played the
00:40:54 tutorial. The peak experience is I think what you and I had playing the playing the tutorial
00:40:59 ruminating on it for months, then playing the full game with that in mind, because people who
00:41:04 just play the game now, they like almost nobody is going to actually do the reset stuff with Toriel
00:41:09 when they first play the tutorial, the tutorial. Oh, my God. Oh, fucking. Are you fucking seething
00:41:17 me right now? I can't believe I never saw this connection. Okay, guys, you're joking, right?
00:41:24 Yeah. No, no, no, no, I never joke. All right. Well, in any case, I think that it like
00:41:33 homestuck back in the day. God, it was a pun. God, it was a pun all along. Oh, my God.
00:41:39 I think time travel did currently as I exist now time travel did more with or sorry,
00:41:45 homestuck did more with time travel than I've ever seen in any other medium. And so it's the
00:41:49 pinnacle of like time travel stories. And I think that Undertale, I'm sure someone could do it better,
00:41:55 you know, eventually, I think it's the pinnacle of like meta narrative in video games using like
00:41:59 mechanics and stuff. It's that's my I think it's the best example so far. Yeah, that's all I'm saying.
00:42:05 I'm not saying it's the best that could ever be. But I mean, best I know I haven't read House of
00:42:09 Leaves. I do want to do that. That could be it. I could maybe I don't know. It looks pretty good.
00:42:15 I guess you could cheat and say that we're only talking about video games, but fuck that.
00:42:18 Let's talk about all mediums. All mediums. I never played the Doki Doki leadership glove,
00:42:23 but it has that sort of shenanigans, doesn't it? One day I'll do that maybe. It's supposed to be
00:42:27 pretty amazing. Like you edit like the actual data files. I mean, that's just programming. But
00:42:32 if they make it part of the gameplay, that's that's pretty cool. That's pretty impressive.
00:42:38 Well, there you go. Sans is in Undertale and also in Smash Brothers. What do you know?
00:42:43 Dimensional Merge is upon us, ladies and gentlemen. This is evidence.
00:42:48 Have you guys heard like a really stupid, not even a theory, but a comparison,
00:42:53 how Sans just looks like Steven Universe without the skin?
00:42:57 I mean, he also looks like Ness. I've seen the thing that's like actually
00:43:05 Steven with his new pink jacket from the movie. If you just make that blue,
00:43:09 he looks even more like Sans now, who's been wearing a jacket the whole time.
00:43:13 Speaking of Steven and Sam. The time lines are slowly coming together.
00:43:17 Yeah, speaking of Steven. New movie, new movie. I want to discuss the new movie.
00:43:22 Sure. Me and Tom have seen it, so I'm happy to talk about it.
00:43:25 Sorry, sorry, Ben. You just had to watch it. Ben, just go download the movie,
00:43:33 watch it on like seven X speed and like half like three you can jump in.
00:43:35 I've got my own shit to say. You fucking cowards.
00:43:40 We'll go on, Mage. What did you think?
00:43:43 I didn't know what to expect when I went into the movie. All I knew about the movie
00:43:47 and when I went in was like, Steven has a neck. That's all. That's all the spoilers I got.
00:43:51 Indeed. That's some real character development right there.
00:43:53 Yeah. And then like when I saw, I saw immediately like, you know,
00:43:57 those pastel colors on Steven, I was like, oh, I wonder, I wonder how long is it going to take
00:44:02 Yeah, excuse me.
00:44:06 How long is it going to take for Internet to be like, oh, look at the trans colors on Steven.
00:44:12 Steven does say trans rights. This is his only line in the film.
00:44:23 Well, now I got a fucking watch.
00:44:27 I'm not against the idea or anything. It's just like, oh, those are pretty good.
00:44:30 For people who hate trans, I'll just give you an out. It's also a fact that the four colors
00:44:35 he's wearing do reflect the colors of the diamond authority. So there's your out if you want.
00:44:39 Like, no, no, no, it's not trans. It's, uh, yeah.
00:44:41 That just means the diamond authority is trans.
00:44:43 Thanks, God.
00:44:46 But yeah, so and I watched it. It was a musical and but they were like,
00:44:51 Sure was talking.
00:44:52 I did like a few of the again, like the villain song is one of the best songs and any
00:44:57 Which one? Which one? There's several.
00:44:59 Both all of them.
00:45:01 I mean, you could mean other friends or you could mean drift away, etc, etc.
00:45:07 I like both of them. Those are the way two songs that I really like. I guess I like
00:45:12 Okay, no, I'm a little bit torn on that song that he sang at the beginning and at the end with the
00:45:16 We adore you. You're not hurt. We know you're not hurt.
00:45:20 Whatever comes my way because as long as I can say here I am in the future with my friends.
00:45:30 Yeah, I completely forgot that song.
00:45:33 And I mean, like all of them are pretty okay songs. They're not they're not bad or anything.
00:45:39 I remember some of them better than others.
00:45:42 Just with a lot of Steven songs. I'm probably going to get fly for this, but I don't like
00:45:47 most of the Steven Universe songs. I agree. I like one or two of them that were more like
00:45:55 better sang, but like most of them are just like what like Steven on a ukulele or something. I don't
00:46:00 know. That's interesting. I didn't like most of the songs, but like in this in this in this movie,
00:46:05 they're pretty good. I like them. They're nice. I like I like Pearl's explanation song. I don't
00:46:11 know what it's called, but it's kind of fun. It's got like a long like pearl boot.exe name or something.
00:46:16 It's pretty funny. Yeah. It's just it was it was quite cute. Something is clearly wrong. I love the
00:46:22 animation at that time. Yeah. Yeah. It was really fun. When I saw a spinel with how with her rubber
00:46:29 hose animation. I bet you love. I bet you nutted instantly when you saw a spinel. Why is the air
00:46:33 going crazy for some spinel? Okay, that's that's the thing because as soon as I saw a spinel,
00:46:39 I was like, Oh, the internet is going to eat her up. She has that she has that, you know,
00:46:44 Oh, she could be your angle or your devil. We like we like old animations. We like rubber
00:46:49 hose. We like Cuphead and stuff like that. I knew I knew the internet is going to eat her up.
00:46:55 And it did. And like, I don't have a problem with it. But it's just like,
00:47:01 I don't want to say it's better because but it like it felt weird to see her so animated in
00:47:07 comparison to everyone else being all a rubber hosie and stretchy and stuff. And I know that's
00:47:10 her shtick, but it's just so weird to see her like that. Like, so she's in, you know, that sort
00:47:15 of job and just like, are all spinels meant to be like rubber hosie little psychic character
00:47:20 things. Presumably, presumably, we don't see any others. But yeah, it's yeah, it's just I just
00:47:27 I just like spinel because I'm like, Oh, the Steven Universe staff can actually animate good.
00:47:34 I mean, I'm sure you guys heard, I loved the balloon inflating and deflating sound effects
00:47:39 as she stretched. There was so much soul so much soul in that animation. I did I did end up liking
00:47:46 her. I thought I wasn't going to like her initially. When I saw her, I thought she was going to be
00:47:50 super annoying. But no, she's fine. I liked her. And she had her I mean, even to the characters,
00:47:56 she was rather annoying to I mean, intentionally sell. Yeah, but there's a but there's like
00:48:01 annoying for a purpose like within within reason in the show and like just being so annoying that
00:48:07 you feel the annoyed rather than like you understand that never really. Yeah, she never
00:48:12 did. She she's good. I like her. And then like her backstory and the song just like, Oh, that's
00:48:16 sad. I like I like this. This is really sad. But yeah, well, hey, if I can give my yeah, go ahead.
00:48:24 I'm done. I this was one of my favorite movies I've seen in a million years. This was like a
00:48:33 nine to a 10 for me. I fucking loved this movie. Not every song was like a perfect 10 or anything.
00:48:42 I love this movie so I watched this movie like maybe four or five times all in all. I spent like
00:48:48 a day in meditation at my deep feelings about the the issues at play in this children's cartoon,
00:48:56 which are incredibly poignant to the issues of today. And I recorded a we Agua that is currently
00:49:03 being edited about this exact movie and will be out by the time people hear this. I love this
00:49:08 fucking movie. I love spinel. I love the usage of I mean pink diamond piece of shit, but like
00:49:15 great usage of her character. Because if I can just spoil just one of the themes of the movie,
00:49:20 the theme here is about family. Okay, it's about family. It's about family. What happens when
00:49:26 okay, like Steve, this movie takes place. It's Steven and it's all the kids like the song is
00:49:31 about like happily ever after never ends. That's like the opening. They're in there happily ever
00:49:35 after they've solved all problems. A racism has dropped to zero. We did it, you guys. And all
00:49:41 of a sudden, so life is perfect. But spinel spinel was an old friend of pink diamonds who got left
00:49:48 behind. I won't go into how you should go watch the fucking movie and watch all of Steven Universe,
00:49:53 which is unequivocally gone down in history as one of my favorite shows of all time. I just
00:50:00 I love everything about okay, I don't love everything about it, but it just overall it is
00:50:04 one of the greatest shows I've ever seen and I go back to watch it all the time. But okay, back
00:50:08 on the point. The theme here happily ever after happened, but spinel was literally not included
00:50:17 in everyone else's happiness. Everyone in the world got a happy ever after, but spinel was
00:50:22 forgotten and left behind. And so she comes back full school shooter. And this to me is exactly
00:50:30 like one of the most important issues. Just like when Sonichu didn't accept the CPU goddesses and
00:50:35 decided to shoot up the mall, the Charlottesville mall. Did that happen recently? Yes, Sonichu did
00:50:41 that. Listen, wait for my lecture. Okay, okay, I'll get into it. I mean, everything about it,
00:50:48 like to me, it felt very obvious that this movie was kind of about the exact, it's not literally
00:50:55 about a school shooter, but it's about those feelings that those people have, like when you
00:50:59 don't fit in, when you're bullied, when you're not appreciated by the people around you, when
00:51:03 everyone else seems happy, but you're left behind. And spinel is quite clear. She's like,
00:51:08 I came here to do violence against strangers because I hate the world now. This is just exactly
00:51:15 the kind of thing that we're seeing. And I thought it was packaged so poignantly, so beautifully.
00:51:21 And the song Drift Away, I feel like the song Drift Away is the kind of song I could feel myself
00:51:27 committing suicide to. I want to make a suicide playlist. I think I've said this before. But this
00:51:32 100% qualifies as a song that you want. I almost felt like it was taking me to like a dark place
00:51:40 because the movie has, I'm not joking, the movie has a happy ending. But for whatever reason,
00:51:47 the strongest feelings in the movie are the lowest point where we learn spinel's backstory
00:51:53 and she sings the song. I listened to that song over and over and over again. And I felt myself
00:51:58 like drifting into a dark place with the character. And this is why I spent like a whole day like
00:52:04 meditating on it. And then like I kind of had to force myself like, no, Nate, like it's okay,
00:52:09 like things are good. It's not all bad. Like I wanted to say like- Were you getting radicalized?
00:52:14 I was getting hardcore radicalized against Pink Diamond and I wanted to murder her and her whole
00:52:19 family. But then I kind of had to jolt myself out of it like, no, the world is not an all bad place.
00:52:26 Pink Diamond, you know, there are actually kind of reasons that aren't just pure malignancy
00:52:31 in what resulted in basically a torturous life for spinel. There are reasons that are just maybe
00:52:37 more carelessness or immaturity. You shouldn't say that like everything's bad, because one person
00:52:43 did something that ended up hurting you really, really bad. And it really affected me in a deep,
00:52:48 deep way. And it kind of was a little bit too strong for me and I couldn't handle it. So I had to just-
00:52:54 Okay, I guess I gotta watch this movie now. I feel bad even over hyping it.
00:52:59 I guess I gotta go get my own opinion, huh? I had zero hype going into this movie and I saw
00:53:03 Spinal and I thought like, oh, this is going to be shit. I was so blown away by how much I love
00:53:08 this fucking movie and, frankly, how much I love Steven Universe overall. Right now, it's making
00:53:14 me emotional just thinking about like taking a journey with these characters and seeing how happy
00:53:19 things end up and how they bring up issues like this. Like, Steven, at the end, he's like,
00:53:24 nah, happily ever after, like, it's a lie was kind of his point. Like, there will always be more work
00:53:28 to do. We've always got to help people. All this time you were pretending so much for my happy ending.
00:53:34 Exactly it. But I, you know, I don't want to go on too long. It just, it made me feel so many things.
00:53:39 It's interesting because like, I'm curious to see your, uh, your Viagra you're going to do on this
00:53:45 because the movie for me was like a seven, maybe? A seven. Well, I think that like, I mean, if you
00:53:51 look at like the kind of thing, this appeals, some things just hit your strike zone, you know?
00:53:55 Yeah. And like having a movie like this, which it's, it's almost like, it's like a, a movie about
00:54:01 like the kid who was bullied in school who like didn't find happiness and like decided to do
00:54:07 terrible things. But instead of like painting that guy is like purely evil, it like tries to
00:54:13 understand why they feel that way. And even the people who made them feel that way, they have
00:54:16 some reasons for what they did. A lot of people are saying Pink Diamond's like pure evil. I think
00:54:20 that's an exaggeration. No, I don't think Pink Diamond is evil. I think the great thing about
00:54:24 the movie, I think the themes are the strongest part for sure. And like Steven Universe has always
00:54:29 been pretty good at painting everybody in shades of gray. Like there's no like hardcore villain,
00:54:34 you know, that's why everybody can get redeemed pretty much because there's possibly too much so.
00:54:38 But yeah, yeah, possibly to its detriment at some degree, but like it's, it's, it's playing,
00:54:43 it's playing to its thematic messaging and it sticks to it, you know, through hell or high
00:54:48 water is that everybody has like some nuance to them. And that's cool. Spinell was great.
00:54:54 I really liked Spinell's like arc and like what they did with her and all that kind of stuff.
00:54:58 And like, it was a good way of like leveraging more of like getting to know Pink Diamond and
00:55:02 I guess maybe it's like a personal thing for me because the movie does like one of the things
00:55:07 that I just is like a personal pet peeve and fiction is when like they do something to the
00:55:12 characters that you know is temporary and is definitely going to be reverse. So you have
00:55:17 to sit there and wait for it to go back to normal because like, I mean, that, that is the plot of
00:55:22 the movie. 100%. It's like the plot of the first half of the movie. They cut because like I was
00:55:26 afraid that it was going to do it the entire movie because like spoilers for anybody who hasn't
00:55:31 watched like go watch it. It is worth watching. But in the beginning of the movie, Spinell has
00:55:36 this weapon that resets a gem to factory settings, essentially. She hard resets everybody. So Steven
00:55:42 loses all of his control of his powers and all the gems go back to like stock versions of the
00:55:47 gems without any of their character development. Like they don't know who each other is and shit.
00:55:51 And like, you know, immediately this isn't going to stick. And like that's like, I don't know,
00:55:55 for some reason, when when movies do that or narratives do that, I'm like, now I just got
00:55:59 to slog through like shenanigans until we get back to the inevitable end state of like, you know,
00:56:04 like there's so many songs. There's only so many songs I can take about how much Ruby and Sapphire
00:56:10 love each other. Right. Like I when when that was initially revealed during the season three
00:56:16 finale or whatever, that was like the highlight of the show. What was it stronger than you?
00:56:21 Yeah, it took the internet by storm. It was a huge big fucking deal because it was as fuck.
00:56:27 But how many times do we need to have an episode about yeah. So and like so that section, honestly,
00:56:33 their thing was kind of the most boring. Seeing Pearl reverted to factory settings settings
00:56:37 was was kind of more interesting because we haven't seen her that way right really before.
00:56:41 I mean, that was probably the coolest part of that section. But I just feel like that whole
00:56:44 section didn't do a lot for the overall narrative because like we're talking about this like whole
00:56:50 arc with Spinell and everything. I mean, I totally agree. And I think even her just being there and
00:56:55 trying to like fuck up the planet again was enough to be like, Yeah, my happy endings ruined. We
00:56:59 didn't need to kill all this. Here's my case for that. On the one hand, I totally agree with your
00:57:04 points. That makes makes perfect sense. And I agree. Like they absolutely retreaded old ground
00:57:09 for the sake of like, I mean, okay, this is a movie. It's been like, I don't know,
00:57:13 maybe like a year since there's been Steven Universe stuff. I felt like it was like they did
00:57:17 it to kind of establish the characters for people. Yeah, I think especially if people are probably
00:57:22 going to jump into a movie before watching like five seasons of a show, that's something that I'm
00:57:26 sure a decent number of people could do. And if you haven't watched any Steven Universe, I would
00:57:30 recommend you don't do that. And instead, you just watch the whole show, then watch the movie.
00:57:34 But if you only got two hours and you're going to die, okay, then go watch the movie. That's,
00:57:39 that's fine. Don't make peace with your family or anything. Just watch Steven. Yeah, just watch
00:57:43 this movie. There was a utility though, even has a suicide song in there. If you want to end it,
00:57:46 like it does have a suicide song. No doubt. Here's here's the reason why I think that was a good
00:57:51 usage in part because I still agree with your point. It was redundant for a lot of it. And we
00:57:56 got to see fresh things like Amethyst being reverted. We never seen her when she was first born.
00:58:01 She does this like gimmick where she just repeats things. She's got like a blank brain basically.
00:58:06 And I mean, that was that amazing payoff to that where like they do a song that's based on the
00:58:11 gimmick of repeating after me, which is like that was like, I loved that touch. I thought that was
00:58:16 so clever and such a genius way to like do that little progression for her. And then like Pearl
00:58:21 is like a robot. She's just being like a servant. She gets like a new master with Greg. All great.
00:58:26 Okay, but the utility in like going over the love, because like the way that they get their memories
00:58:34 back is they relive their experiences together. So like Steven needs to, you know, show Amethyst
00:58:40 a fun time. They need to go do the activities they like to do. And that'll like help her remember.
00:58:45 They do their secret handshake. That helps her. Pearl, they need to like show, they need to like
00:58:49 reproduce Pearl's plot development. So she realized she can be free and be her own person.
00:58:53 Doesn't need to just be a slave or whatever. Like her turning point sort of wasn't Rose Quartz.
00:59:00 It was her own freedom, so to speak. Yeah, that's true. The absence of a master ultimately what
00:59:05 did it. But and then like Garnett is the same thing. But like what the point I see to this,
00:59:11 the reason why I like all of that was because in all these scenes, in every single scene where we
00:59:16 see Pearl doing things and like Amethyst doing things with Steven, like reliving the moment,
00:59:20 it's like we feel how much love Steven has for Amethyst and Pearl and Garnett and you know Ruby
00:59:27 and Sapphire. That's so apparent to us. And it makes me reflect thinking back I did not like
00:59:33 Amethyst very much at first. I love Amethyst now. I've become such a fan of all these characters.
00:59:39 Okay, but the point of this is we as the viewer and Steven himself love and have a huge attachment
00:59:44 to these characters. So we feel that viscerally when we're trying to restore them to their memories.
00:59:48 But that entire time, Spinell, who's been reverted to her like happy go lucky, you know,
00:59:54 retarded, mildly annoying self, she is in she's literally third wheeling the entire time and
01:00:01 you can feel Steven doesn't really want her around. The contrast is so clear between how much Steven
01:00:08 cares about like Amethyst, for example, versus not wanting to have to bother with Spinell. It's
01:00:13 just a story about that annoying kid who's not terrible, but is hanging out with you anyway and
01:00:19 you don't really want them around. And this comes to like the final though the head during the the
01:00:23 song or whatever, where Spinell really recognized like, Oh, wow, Steven likes them way more than me,
01:00:29 which is exactly the problem that she had with pink, pink diamond. So like there was a utility.
01:00:34 No, definitely that I thought was enjoyable on its own anyway. Totally. And that that that definitely
01:00:40 it served a purpose and like for Splinell setting up like the fact like, Oh, I don't, I'm not cared
01:00:45 for in the way that these people are. And like, it's just like, I'm history is essentially repeating
01:00:49 itself, you know, exactly. I could see people. I just personally because that that certain plot
01:00:55 element drives me up a wall, I would rather they've done it a different way. Well, that's
01:00:58 understandable. So the other thing that I kind of, I don't want to say had an issue with it,
01:01:03 but it's kind of confused, not even confused about, but just like kind of shrugging at was the end of
01:01:07 the movie, the way the way they resolved the conflict with Spinell is that like, like, like
01:01:13 super big spoiler, this is the end of the movie is that she goes back with the diamonds and goes
01:01:19 back to homeworld and hangs out with them. And the diamonds are like, Oh, like you remind us of
01:01:23 pink, because the whole reason the movie starts with them wanting Steven to stay on homeworld,
01:01:28 because you're pink and we miss pink and we fetishize pink, I guess, and stay with us. And
01:01:35 the end of the movie is that Spinell serves that same purpose. So she goes back and like,
01:01:40 they are guests are going to fetishize her. And so she can have friends now. And it's just like,
01:01:46 not only the diamonds, like, like, that's not really healthy, you know, like fetishizing someone
01:01:50 who's dead like that. Because like, the whole point of the movie is talking about how like,
01:01:54 there is no happily ever after and like, things are always changing and you have to move on.
01:01:58 And like the diamonds don't move on, they never have and they assumedly now never will,
01:02:03 because they're just going to project all of their musings and desires for pink.
01:02:07 In their own song, they repeat as if they're trying to convince themselves the line like,
01:02:13 Yes, we know that you're not her. But like, it's fucking weird to convince us that they think that.
01:02:19 But I'm a little skeptical if they really believe. So that's the thing. I agree. The ending and a
01:02:25 lot a lot of the movie, honestly, like was it it was this easy to heal Spinell's wound and like
01:02:29 make or not a school shooter anymore? Like, I mean, there's some logic to that. But the overall
01:02:35 thing that a lot of people are criticized Steven Universe for and me too, is that it's it is a
01:02:40 supremely optimistic version of everything. This movie sounds really strange. It is interesting.
01:02:48 And I love it personally. But you should definitely watch it. I wish I watched this movie.
01:02:55 Well, it's not too late, even though you know everything that happens.
01:02:59 If you want to link, I got one. I'm so confused. Okay, I'll figure it out. I'll have to go figure
01:03:03 it out. What can I do? What can I do about this problem of having? I think I think it's I think
01:03:07 we need I think Ben needs to watch this movie and we need to have Steven Fornevers.
01:03:12 Oh, well, this is kind of it right now. I don't know if we should do another one.
01:03:16 I mean, then make a separate episode next episode. I have some opinions about your guys
01:03:22 opinions about this movie. Ben, just just watch the movie as soon as we're done and then send
01:03:27 me like a five minute take of your thoughts and I'll splice it in right here. All right. Future
01:03:33 Ben here. I watched it. I watched Steven Universe movie at 1.2 times speed. I guess I liked it.
01:03:44 The music was pretty good. Didn't like that one song, the truth, the garnet song,
01:03:50 didn't like basically anything to do with like the gems reverting and coming back,
01:03:57 getting them back. Oh, we got to we got to make them remember. Garnet remembering doesn't make
01:04:01 any sense. It doesn't make any sense. That part's terrible. I wish that weren't like half the movie.
01:04:08 Whatever. Teen Steven's cool. Fusing with his dad. Yeah, it's weird, but it's true that the
01:04:14 messaging about fusion has been inconsistent. So whatever. I don't know why I don't know why
01:04:20 Steven Greg fusion is like ripped because like they're both fat. So why is a fusion of them ripped?
01:04:25 I don't know. Whatever. Best part of the movie hands down. I mean, I mean, it's all about
01:04:32 Spinal. Spinal? Fuck, how do they say it? It's all about Spinal. It's all about evil Spinal
01:04:37 chewing the scenery, mugging for the camera, doing cool poses and looking awesome and doing
01:04:42 cool fights and those like those like two scenes that you can tell are animated by like an anime
01:04:47 studio that look fucking awesome. They're so fucking cool. Holy shit. And the ending's the
01:04:53 ending's dumb. The ending about they take they take pink they take Spinal back and they like,
01:04:58 oh, we'll love you instead. It's dumb. But I mean, the diamonds are all dumb. They've always been
01:05:03 terrible. Nobody likes the diamonds. So whatever. Nothing is ruined. It's contrived in the end.
01:05:10 Whatever. Is the earth fucked? Seems like the earth's like fuck. I don't know. She injected
01:05:15 the whole thing of poison. It was supposed to kill the entire earth. I don't know why they're so
01:05:19 fucking calm that whole time. It's just about Spinal. It's just about her cool faces. So fucking
01:05:27 evil. So fucking sick. All right. Yeah, go watch it. Fuck. Maybe I will. Maybe I just fucking will.
01:05:36 Hey, last point though about the the the other thing that seems okay. Like they once there was
01:05:42 one thought I had about the ending too, which is just like, so as you said, at the beginning,
01:05:47 they want Steven. Okay, Steven, at the end of season five, they're like, Steven, you're pink. We want
01:05:52 you back because you're pink. Like sure, you're weird now and you're a little fat boy. It doesn't
01:05:56 matter. You're pink. It's like they they were it's understood to be that like they understand at
01:06:01 the end because like some crazy shit happens. Pink is gone. Steven is here to stay that like
01:06:07 Steven is not pink anymore. But he kind of is. I mean, it's her son. It's at the very least,
01:06:12 it's pink son. So that's a pretty big connection. So you can see why they'd want Steven around.
01:06:16 I think I think more to the point is that like diamonds don't reproduce like humans do. So from
01:06:23 their perspective, this is still pink. Like that was the whole point in the beginning. And I you
01:06:27 know, sure, like you can't really reframe their understanding. That's pinks diamond. That's pinks
01:06:32 gem. Like you can't change who you are from their entire cultural perspective. Like that is still
01:06:37 pink. And so and that's totally understandable. Right. But like so like my point is like, once
01:06:42 they accept, even if they accept that Steven isn't pink anymore, and that he's like different,
01:06:47 there's still a very strong connection there. Spinell, on the other hand, is just like a friend
01:06:54 of pinks, basically. But they're and yes, she's very simple. Like she's designed to look like pink
01:06:58 with like the poofy pants. And she's fun. And it seems like they're almost too willing to accept
01:07:03 this as a replacement for Steven. And they just like leave as soon as they've got Spinell. That
01:07:08 seems okay, again, especially considering they showed up to stay with Steven on earth. Yeah,
01:07:14 but then they were like, well, I guess we have this facsimile of pink now. So they were willing
01:07:20 to stay in a place where they really didn't like just everyone wants to suck Steven's cock. So
01:07:27 this is literally like that that way. Wait, speaking of Steven sucking cock, can we talk
01:07:31 about how we gem fucked his dad in this episode? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. You know that he had two
01:07:37 dicks. You know, yeah, yeah, yeah. So Steven and Greg fuse and become a four armed pompadour
01:07:45 guitar wielding madman to guitar wielding. Yeah, who seduces Pearl essentially and wakes her up
01:07:52 from her, her reset status. And it was very fucking strange. It was pretty sick. Because like,
01:07:58 because like, again, the show has like, made it pretty clear that that fusion is a metaphor for
01:08:05 like relationships and possibly sex. They're just going back and forth on this. There's no
01:08:09 consistency. So some people say he's just love and they could be like, I don't know paternal.
01:08:16 All right, all right, that's that's a slippery slope argument right there. I don't know how to
01:08:22 they code it so hard in some episodes, but then they don't at all. And when's when's Connie,
01:08:28 Steven and Greg going to fuse into a crazy monster? I mean, now we I mean, we've long
01:08:33 known you could fuse every being in existence, you know, all of the city fuses into the ultimate
01:08:38 life form. Yeah, go for it. Why not? That's what God is. I don't know. Oh, it's like, oh, it's like
01:08:44 a Madoka Magica moment where like, it turns out that what God is is all life form fused into one
01:08:49 being who then go like does things retroactively through time to control things from the future.
01:08:56 I'm just saying it's possible. That's what Madoka Magica. There's enough anime influence
01:09:00 in Steven Universe to make that possible. That's true. That's true. Okay, well, here's the thing.
01:09:05 Is this the end of Steven Universe? Like season six is I believe confirmed. And it is one more
01:09:11 season. I think it should have ended it with this movie. It would have been a perfect ending. I think
01:09:16 you're right because I anything more at this point does seem it's downhill. Redone baby 100%.
01:09:22 Speaking of season's ending, just quickly question. Have you guys seen My Little Pony ended?
01:09:29 Is it over? Did the final episode actually air? Yeah, I saw the I saw some gifts of the of the final
01:09:34 Nate spoiled it like a week ago in the chat. I didn't mean to. I thought it well. I thought I was
01:09:39 scrolling through the chat and you're like, Oh, this is the ending. And you put in a spoiler
01:09:42 tag. I'm like, that's considerate. And they're like, actually, fuck it. Here we go. I'm like,
01:09:45 because I thought no one cared. I can't box. Twilight looks so I have seven seasons to go. God
01:09:52 damn it. Not really. Like five. I got a ways to go. You know what? I do want to watch it. I might
01:09:59 skip every episode up to that point. But I do want to watch it. It seems to be very similar like
01:10:04 one episode like the very final episode. It's like it is a time to get forward. So you might as
01:10:09 well just watch that one. Is it really? That's exactly it. Like the kind of the story,
01:10:13 spoilers, by the way, for MLP for the seven people who care.
01:10:17 I mean, I kind of care. I just I, I spoil, I stumbled upon them and I was like, yeah,
01:10:21 all right, that's fine. I was doing so good. I dodged everything on Twitter. And I was like,
01:10:25 all right, I can watch some point of my leisure. But no, Nate comes in, ruins. So sorry.
01:10:32 Twilight is fucked. Twilight is a fucking Celestia sized horse with a big glowy mane,
01:10:39 but it looks like shit because she still has like the same kind of haircut. And it doesn't
01:10:43 look very good. It doesn't look very good. She was not designed to be this way. Implication,
01:10:46 that, uh, Rainbow Dash and Applejack are gay together. That does seem to be the implication.
01:10:51 What? It kind of seems, it kind of, it's kind of implied. It kind of seems like maybe Fluttershy
01:10:55 and Discord. Oh yeah. Which I hate that. Definitely. They tell me Rare Jack's not canon. I hate this
01:11:00 show. It's not canon, dude. It's not canon. No, no, I'm done. I'm done. There's too, there's too
01:11:04 many hints dropped throughout the entire show. Pinkie Pie and Cheesy Jean Sandwich. Oh yeah,
01:11:09 that's such a show. They're fucking, they had a kid. Oh my God. They had a kid and it just looks
01:11:16 like fucking curly hair Fluttershy. Yeah, I was going to say like the, like the one image I saw was
01:11:21 like a fucking nightmare. I don't want to watch it at all. No, it's fine. The image I got spoiled
01:11:25 was like with all of them together. And I saw the little curly hair Fluttershy thing. And I was
01:11:30 like either either Pinkie Pie got together with Cheese or Pinkie Pie got together with Fluttershy.
01:11:36 I guess Rarity just dies alone. Okay, that's, that's fine. They saved Rarity for me. She has a
01:11:41 Prodigy now. Rarity gets old and her hair turns gray. They're all old. They're all fucking old.
01:11:45 They're all, they're all gonna die. It's, it's happening. They're all gonna die and Twilight's
01:11:49 gonna be, remember how they said, wait, they're confirmed on Twitter saying Twilight wouldn't
01:11:55 outlive everybody else and they blatantly lie. Because she's gonna kill herself when they all
01:12:00 die. That's why. Maybe she's gonna. And Discord just rides from the ashes. It's like my long game
01:12:05 plan has finally paid off. Oh my goodness. Maybe, maybe she's gonna make everyone look forever.
01:12:11 You should find the magical. I mean, well, that's kind of fun. She's the Prince of Magic. So, you
01:12:16 know, she could. There's a, there was another thing. Shit, what was it? It's bullshit, I tells you.
01:12:21 Oh, I don't know. It's, it's complicated. Oh, apparently Luna and Celestia just retired. Yep.
01:12:27 Just retired. They just retired. They're done. They're just done doing a good run and it's over
01:12:33 now. The one to the Pony version of Florida. This is the stupidest shit I've ever heard in my life.
01:12:38 You know, look, we, I feel like all this thing is kind of like with Steven Universe. I feel like
01:12:44 you can talk shit and you can roast it. I bet if I watched this episode, I bet I would love it.
01:12:49 That's my contention. And I bet I would literally cry if I watched the final song. I bet it's got
01:12:54 that emotional sting to it. It's got those good songs. It's probably a musical and it'll make
01:12:59 you feel good, but then you'll think about it three days and you're like, wait a minute. Well,
01:13:03 fuck, I guess. You get to see what most, if not all of the cast is doing right now. You get to see
01:13:08 the cutie microseed is all grown up and stuff and excuse me for my cat. Whoa. Child. Okay. There was
01:13:16 just like the Steven Universe movie. The end of my little pony is bad. That's what I'm hearing right
01:13:21 now. Sure. It reminds me very much of the last episode of Star Trek The Next Generation is All
01:13:27 Good Things, part one and part two. And it's not quite this, but it's kind of a vision of the future
01:13:36 where there's time travel involved in it, but it's very well done as most is in Star Trek.
01:13:41 Not all the time, but it's like we see what each of them get up to in the future. And here's an
01:13:46 interesting thing. In that episode, Minor Spoiler. Well, actually, these are kind of major spoilers
01:13:51 for Next Generation. But I'm just going to say that data, we see him, he's like a, he retires
01:13:56 from Starfleet and he becomes like a professor. And he has like these distinguished white like
01:14:00 lines on the sides of his head. And he's like, he's in this giant library and just seems to be
01:14:04 consuming knowledge and he's become way more human. And it's just having a great life. Until a little
01:14:10 movie called Star Trek Nemesis came out like 10 years later, where they literally just kill data
01:14:16 despite the just just forget all the Star Trek movies. They're not real. Data becomes a wonderful
01:14:22 professor from like Oxford or something. He's got a beautiful, sexy robot daughter or something.
01:14:27 And life is great. Speaking of that great ending to Star Trek, the next generation,
01:14:32 are you ready for Star Trek Picard to steamroll all of it even more? Oh, I forgot about that.
01:14:38 I mean, I'm just not like I gave up on Star Trek discovery because it sucked. So I'm just not,
01:14:44 I just don't care anymore. I'm just over. I mean, I still got to get through Voyager and
01:14:48 Enterprise. So that's, that's, yeah, but Picard's going straight for the juggler,
01:14:53 they're going to fucking bring back Picard and they're going to do a bunch of dumb bullshit
01:14:57 because it's written by the same people who do discovery. So I'm not, yeah, I'm not expecting
01:15:02 anything great. I mean, I've been watching the, the red letter media guys are my go to boys to
01:15:07 talk about what to expect from Star Trek. And I've got zero expectations. So not watching,
01:15:12 don't care. Picard's dead. I'd love to be wrong, but you know, these things,
01:15:18 but he's so fucking old, man. He's so fucking old. Patrick Stewart. I don't know. He's still
01:15:24 making it happen. I mean, that's not the major issue because at the end of the end of all good
01:15:28 things, we see Picard retired to his family's vineyard where he makes wine, which he's
01:15:33 passionate about and is totally sick. But whatever. Anyway, everyone go watch Star Trek,
01:15:38 the next generation is really good or Steven Universe. These are all good choices. Now that
01:15:43 we've spoiled the endings for all of them. Go watch them. You know, you know, the thing is by,
01:15:49 look, unironically, by the time, if you said, said like, Oh man, they spoiled, I didn't even
01:15:54 really spoil, but let's say I spoiled the next generation ending. If you sit down, you're like,
01:15:58 fuck it, I'm going to go watch. By the time you get through seven seasons of the next generation,
01:16:03 you will have forgotten what we've said here today. So you know what you should do? If any of
01:16:08 these sound good, go start at the beginning and watch all the way through. I can vouch for Steven
01:16:16 Universe and next generation though. So go watch them. They're, they're worth your time. Okay,
01:16:23 anyway, um, that's it. I have some, I have some recent events. Sure. Discuss. Okay. On this show.
01:16:31 Okay. We would like to get on. Um, see, guys, the contra points deleted or Twitter.
01:16:38 No, I heard, I heard some vague ramblings about this, that something happened.
01:16:42 Point of order real quick. Everyone says this always, this is just a pet pee. People say
01:16:46 deleted Twitter, but I believe that the appearance of this is equivalent to one who has
01:16:51 like privatized or like, like made it so no one can see it. You've deactivated your Twitter. You
01:16:57 can reactivate it whenever you deactivate it. Possibly. Well, you can, can you only deactivate
01:17:02 it for a certain amount of time? I don't know. Don't know. Ben, you're gonna have to deactivate
01:17:07 your Twitter. It's possible it's deactivation, maybe not, whatever, whatever. Um, well, uh, yeah.
01:17:13 Um, so I don't know if you guys know why this happened, but I don't know who this person is.
01:17:20 Well, they're a, they're a Lefty Tuber. Well, they're a, they're a Trans Lefty Tuber.
01:17:25 What's their, what's their name again? Well, they're like, they're like the
01:17:26 contra points, contra points mage. Never heard of them. Okay, go ahead. Yeah, go on.
01:17:33 Um, uh, she, she said some, she said some stuff on Twitter that some people didn't like and it was
01:17:39 about, um, it was like saying that like older trans people are like more, they want to, they
01:17:44 want to like pass as binary basically. Right. They want to like just, just live as a woman,
01:17:49 live as a man or whatever. And like the younger generation is more, more like non-binary stuff.
01:17:54 And it's just, I don't know. She just like acknowledged that difference. And there was a lot
01:17:59 of very terrible on its face. Pretty factual. I haven't seen all the tweet. I haven't seen all
01:18:03 the tweets. Apparently there was more to it. I don't know. There might be more to it than that,
01:18:06 but like my understanding of what I've heard people saying is that basically that was the gist
01:18:10 of it, but people said that this was not woke enough, that she was erasing non-binary people
01:18:17 was stuff and, and, you know, and I mean, genocide right there. That's what that is. That's genocide.
01:18:23 Uh, people say, you know, people said that like, oh, contra points got canceled. She didn't get
01:18:27 canceled. She deleted her own Twitter, but like, what's annoying to me about it? Well, that one
01:18:31 guy just committed suicide. So he just did it himself. Was that a canceling? Oh, I want, that
01:18:36 was my other thing. But let's talk about that in a minute. Let's talk about that in a minute.
01:18:39 I don't know. The annoying thing about contra points is that these are, these are like,
01:18:42 these are trans people, non-binary people that contra points is like a huge advocate for. Yeah.
01:18:47 But then, and then they will fucking rip her apart and abuse her and tear into her and like,
01:18:52 distance themselves from her and say that, oh, we need to do better. We don't want this person
01:18:56 representing us because she's like, because they disagree on this one, like relatively minor
01:19:01 point of contention. That's been the entire problem with the, the, the lefty tube kind of, or that
01:19:05 sphere is that you step out of line a little bit. And it's not even stepping on the line. It's like,
01:19:10 you have a minor disagreement on the general kind of talking points and you're immediately
01:19:15 excommunicated. It's ridiculous. I mean, it is a huge win. It is a huge win. And like, if you can
01:19:21 show, if you're more woke than contra points, if you can be like, contra points is problematic.
01:19:26 Here's why she needs to do better. Here's why I actually am more progressive than, than, than the
01:19:31 legendary contra points. That's huge. You can, she's, she, you can take, if you take her down,
01:19:36 you can springboard yourself. You're the wokest. I mean, I guess that's true. You're even better
01:19:43 than contra points, dude. Cause you killed her. You slew her and you took her and you absorbed
01:19:47 her all her, all this. Think how much slime she dropped. It's a lot. She's very slime based.
01:19:53 Now you're the biggest boy in New Los Angeles city, baby. You know, man, the take, when I
01:20:00 examine the take itself, it doesn't even, I, I, are you looking at the take? No, well, did you say
01:20:06 am I a fan? No, I said, are you looking at the take? Oh, sorry. Not, not right now, not right now,
01:20:11 but I'm just going off of my general understanding. It seemed very strange to me because all it seemed
01:20:16 to say was that contra points was kind of voicing an opinion of herself and people who share her
01:20:22 opinion that did not seem like it was saying like other people can't feel a different way.
01:20:27 They were just kind of expressing a personal desire to kind of just blend in as a woman,
01:20:32 which I mean, how could anyone object to their feelings about how they want to be. It operates
01:20:37 as a hive mind. Twitter is like a hive mind. It's fucking terrifying. I'm looking at the tweets.
01:20:41 I'm looking at the tweets. I mean, I don't get why people are so mad. It sure it's not,
01:20:50 her position itself is not itself advocating non-binary-ness, but it also doesn't seem to
01:20:56 be criticizing it. So I don't get the point. Okay, well, here, I'll just I'll just read what she said.
01:21:01 Okay, give us the actual some of the offending tweets quote. This has happened to me before
01:21:07 in hyperwoke spaces like it's me and a bunch of cis women and we all go in a circle. We all have to
01:21:12 go in a circle saying she her because I'm there. Okay, there's this paradox where I can go to a
01:21:17 sports bar in North Carolina and be mismammed all night no question. But in self consciously
01:21:22 trans inclusive spaces, I have to explain my pronouns and watch woke people awkwardly correct
01:21:27 themselves every time they say you guys. I guess it's good for trans people who use they them only
01:21:33 and want only gender neutral language. But it comes at the minor expense of semi-passable
01:21:38 trans is like me. And that's super fucking hard for us. Okay, I find very so I see. Yeah, so I see
01:21:45 why I see the conflict here. I see that like, sure, sure, she is saying yes, there is sort of a
01:21:50 conflict of interest in that like about your fucking milk toast neutral takes on something
01:21:56 though. I mean, yeah, there's nothing incendiary there. It's just a literal statement of fact
01:22:02 and something it's just the fact that she's I guess not on the team enough of one group. It's
01:22:07 not even that it's just a statement that like the language it's being used here is at a crossroads
01:22:12 and that you're you got to lean one way or the other and it's going to cause I mean, why aren't
01:22:17 we mad at these people just as an example for denying contra points is desire to live in a
01:22:22 specific is punching up, dude. They're punching up so it doesn't count. Oh, our dynamics. I mean,
01:22:31 look, I think punching up at the person who's fucking like doing them more favors than like
01:22:36 anyone else on the internet. You know, you're done. It's maybe this is silly. Maybe this is
01:22:43 silly, but especially now I wish I'd gotten a chance to meet contra points at before they died.
01:22:48 They're dead now. Their Twitter is gone. They might as well be where they were
01:22:51 suicided. Yeah, they were listening to that spinel song. They're like screw it.
01:22:56 Contra points. Don't listen to Steven Universe movie. Don't do it. Now that's actually not funny
01:23:02 because I don't want this person to hurt themselves in any way and that has happened kind of recently
01:23:06 to make it clear because everyone was talking over me. I said deleted their Twitter not deleted
01:23:10 themselves. Oh, whoops. Okay, I took it a different way.
01:23:12 Contra points makes an insane amount of money, by the way. I believe that doesn't surprise me in the
01:23:17 slightest. Okay, I mean, look, they make extremely high. Ben, when you're gonna start dipping into
01:23:22 that pool and start ringing in those big victim box, I can't victim. But I mean, I can't do a
01:23:28 contra point stuff. You can you can you can lack the little experience to just make it happen.
01:23:34 I mean, I want to I mean, I'll actually you know what I was thinking. I take it back. Don't do that
01:23:38 because if you do that, it'll take you three months to start building up some momentum and then
01:23:42 they'll find out you're on this podcast and you'll get canceled. So don't even know. Oh, God, they'll
01:23:46 find out that I associate with people who say the n-word. They probably would not be fans of that.
01:23:51 You're fucked before you even began. You know, you know, you know what I think? I was, you guys
01:23:56 heard of this webcom called Stone Toss? I have heard of Stone Toss. I think I could be the lefty Stone Toss.
01:24:01 Big fan.
01:24:06 Okay, I mean, for anyone who doesn't know, Stone Toss is made by a Nazi and well, okay. I mean,
01:24:12 he said he's a Nazi. Are you sure that was like a serious point, though? Because people say those
01:24:17 things as jokes. Um, look, we know he's super right wing. We can all agree on that. Here's what I
01:24:23 think. Here's what I know. Okay, I know that he has said he's a Nazi and that everything he espouses
01:24:28 in his comic is consistent with the ideology of a Nazi. So I'm going to go ahead and say he's a
01:24:33 Nazi. Okay, fine. I feel like this is a pretty open shut case. All right, whatever. Um, I mean,
01:24:39 but okay, at the very least, he's a far right leaning. Yes, we all agree on that. And I feel
01:24:44 like I feel like I could be I feel like I could be lefty Stone Toss. You gotta make Rock Throw
01:24:49 have it be like with a Pokemon angle. Ben used Rock Throw. That's the name. How about Rock Smash?
01:24:54 Right? True. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, we got like Matt Bors, the guy who made the I am very
01:25:01 smart, like you live in a society and let you critique it comic now. I've seen a couple of
01:25:07 comics dissecting how effective how effective Stone Toss is as propaganda and like the way
01:25:12 that it's like punchy and like really easy to understand and like true and like in like funny
01:25:17 and ways that are not necessarily like bigoted, even if they carry like some like dog whistles in
01:25:23 them, like, like you can laugh at them for other reasons, even if you don't really know what they're
01:25:27 saying. Sounds to me, Ben, like you are looking to to as a wise man once said Ben Saint is obsessed
01:25:34 with branding and here he goes again branding himself using his lefty brand. Listen, listen, listen.
01:25:42 I saw I've I've seen a couple of people discussing I've seen a couple of people discussing and I've
01:25:47 and I've heard people say like we need a leftist equivalent like like the left needs a Stone
01:25:54 Toss we don't have anyone who's like but I was the left can't meme as they say I was like well
01:25:59 maybe I don't know like maybe I could maybe I could I mean hey wait a minute I just remembered
01:26:04 that I draw sometimes and I know how to do that these takes a hard left turn in more ways than one
01:26:12 I don't know this is something I was thinking about well you know what I'll say Ben I'll say
01:26:15 about this what I what I I mean look if you want to do it hey that's up to you man that's fine
01:26:20 but uh in terms of like what kind of it's just an idea it's okay okay around my old noggin
01:26:25 in terms of I'm just but then you'll have to post it under a different under a pen name or a pseudonym
01:26:29 because again as soon as they find out you're on the Nazi podcast you're fucked the Nazi podcast
01:26:35 all right podcast piece of in terms of when I think about well the things that I want to extract
01:26:40 from Ben's existence as Kant and I like because I I'm a big fan of the stuff you make um it's uh
01:26:47 like I think about something like Steven Universe look it is unequivocally true it has been stated
01:26:52 by the developers over and over again that like Steven Universe among other things like is is very
01:26:57 clearly intended to promote through art like progressive values and uh like one thing is that
01:27:04 all the gems are nine are non-binary Rebecca Universe is non-binary I suspect this is not a
01:27:09 coincidence and you know what it's probably made me as a person like more just being like oh a
01:27:14 non-binary person oh like a Steven Universe yeah that's oh man you know I get it I get it that's
01:27:19 well you're a non-binary person where's your gem where's your gem I'm gonna find that gem boy let me
01:27:25 look at your body uh uh oh my okay dark twist on the Steven Universe like there are gem hunters who
01:27:32 just rip the gems out of uh gem people and they harvest them and they use it for currency oh if
01:27:36 they meet like the Ferengi in space at some point from Star Trek cross over okay my point
01:27:42 time to write a fanfiction again uh it reminds me uh how much of latinum is a gem worth go yeah
01:27:47 who's like you know that's a good question by the way did you guys know that the currency uh they use
01:27:52 in Star Trek latinum is in fact a liquid encased in worthless worthless gold tablets because gold
01:27:58 I have heard that gold is replicable latinum is not so uh that's why it has value but my point was
01:28:04 Ben if I could have an ideal world uh I want you to make art and everyone in the world to make art
01:28:10 that slowly indoctrinates me into your beliefs and coming along for the ride through subtle and great
01:28:15 characters as opposed to you know outright political message I feel like all art does that that's what
01:28:19 I'm thinking because it's sure my spreading my ideas through this podcast sure aren't working
01:28:23 because everyone in the comments fucking hates me well it's a bit you're going you're going
01:28:28 hard without lube on a Nazi podcast what do you expect is gonna happen it's funny how the last
01:28:33 episode had like particular levels of like bile towards wait even though I was like specifically
01:28:41 less like like like aggressive about stuff like I specifically didn't talk well look I mean the
01:28:47 the commenters don't matter I can tell you that I appreciate I feel like you've been trying to be
01:28:52 you know not not antagonistic I'm trying to be a good boy you know I'm trying to have a good time
01:28:57 that is my prime virtue I want to hang out with everybody here you're all my friends
01:29:01 I just want to have a good time and talk about things that are reasonably interesting
01:29:05 and you know I'm not interested in getting like overly if there's something we strongly disagree on
01:29:09 and it's like an important debate then the PCB theoretically might not be the ideal place to
01:29:14 discuss it you know like if it isn't entertaining anymore but like in general I mean I'll tell
01:29:19 everybody I think Ben's being perfectly reasonable he's got different beliefs from me and several
01:29:23 others that's fine you know he's not being obnoxious about it I'm so reasonable you guys yeah
01:29:30 even though I'm fucking crazy on the inside I'm totally reasonable on the outside and that's
01:29:34 what it's all about I don't know yeah let's oh wait well no sorry I made my point so that's
01:29:42 all right whatever yeah contra points oh what about the suicide guy though that that guy yeah
01:29:47 that's another thing Alex Holoka or Holoka or Holoka okay do you guys do you guys know about
01:29:53 this oh yeah so you heard about this a little bit I did a whole I did a whole bonus podcast on my
01:29:58 patreon.com slash pod station too weekly bonus podcast oh okay there's 15 bonus podcast people
01:30:04 you're missing out on all of them maybe we can hit some highlights there's like okay all right I mean
01:30:08 there's there's developments right so like really first first Zoe Zoe comes out wait sorry Ben can
01:30:14 you tell us who this guy is just to begin okay so Alex Holoka and I try to okay I'm actually
01:30:21 there's more developments I've missed them so I'm fascinated there are there are there are okay I'm
01:30:25 curious how much you guys know about it this is like this is like pro this is like pro Jared again
01:30:30 and that like just more and more information keeps coming out it just keeps deepening the
01:30:33 scandal only like way more important okay um the so Zoe Zoe Quinn comes out with their accusations
01:30:42 they say that this guy Alec so okay do people know who Zoe Quinn is that they're they were the they
01:30:49 were the the by the way the five guys burgers and fries Zoe Quinn today now that's why I'm saying
01:30:55 they they're non-binary now okay yes okay I found this out I found this out it's on whatever it's
01:31:01 on Wikipedia um uh they were the person that's kicked off Gamergate because of like a sex scandal
01:31:09 involving like one of their exes like then reviewed their game and it was like oh that they they had
01:31:14 they oh they exchanged sex for uh for uh sex for free review and also they're a bad person and they
01:31:20 cheat on people and they're a bad girlfriend or they're a bad partner and so everyone hated Zoe
01:31:25 Quinn and then that spawned into Gamergate and then the new circadian and the game was like more
01:31:30 about like the integrity of the journalist or something okay well well it depends on who you
01:31:34 ask Zoe was involved at the beginning for sure I have another bonus podcast on Gamergate
01:31:39 a liar I'll tell you that yeah yeah okay so keep going keep going keep going get everybody up to
01:31:44 speed okay so that so so the so Gamergate just hates Zoe Quinn right but whatever Zoe comes out
01:31:52 with Alec accusations that like 10 years ago this guy Alec Holoka who is one of the two okay there's
01:31:59 a three person team that works on Night in the Woods which is an indie game it's very popular
01:32:04 indie game which I personally have not played but I know Night in the Woods okay okay and there's a
01:32:08 three person team but it seems like the two main it's it's Scott Benson is like the writer and the
01:32:12 artist Scott Benson's wife does I think she also co-writes it I'm not sure and then this other
01:32:18 guy Alec Holoka it was the made mainly the programmer and Alec Holoka had sort of like
01:32:24 gotten in touch with Alec based on Twitter they like Alec had worked on previous games before he
01:32:29 had known like sort of gaming industry inside people like Zoe Quinn okay and he was sort of in
01:32:35 this like weird indie game scene he'd been very successful and he got rich at a young age doing
01:32:40 this and he was kind of like an industry an established industry guy like before Scott got
01:32:45 involved with him so she accuses him of basically being like a fucking physically and sexually
01:32:54 abusive guy to her back when she to her to her yeah specifically to her okay and he and then
01:33:04 Scott Benson and the the Night in the Woods team take Alec off their twitter profile and like they
01:33:11 like distance themselves from him and they like remove reference to him and like it seems like
01:33:16 he's not on the Night in the Woods team anymore and then Alec Holoka kills himself he shoots
01:33:20 himself in the head what was the timeline there was that fast like 48 hours it was like a couple
01:33:24 days oh my god that's fucked up okay all right it was fast um and then and then his sister comes out
01:33:33 his sister comes out with a statement oh how'd you like this one you've you've read this I I saw
01:33:38 bits and pieces of it yeah his sister comes out with a statement that is like you know I knew out
01:33:43 she says she says I knew Alec I believe Zoey Alec didn't want Zoey harassed over this
01:33:51 doesn't help people go after Zoey people call Zoey a murderer like these accusations that you
01:33:57 accused a mentally unstable person of this and you know you're you're a murderer you killed him
01:34:02 you're you're a lie oh she's at it again the Zoey Quinn body count is racking up
01:34:07 um the sister saying that people are accusing Zoey she's not accusing Zoey well she says
01:34:13 she says don't harass Zoey over this and that he wouldn't have wanted that she says that he
01:34:18 specifically said that he wished no ill on Zoey gotcha that's what she says gotcha um let's do
01:34:24 that his own sister she says she believes Zoey okay okay and then Zoey deletes their twitter
01:34:31 and then uh Alec is the other guy Scott Benson doesn't delete his twitter but he's he's like
01:34:38 the co-writer he releases a blog post talking about his life with like the time that he knew Alec
01:34:45 and like based it is my take this this is the last thing based on everything Scott said like
01:34:51 Alec Holokos a piece of shit and he's better off dead he's a fucking scumbag okay sorry did you
01:34:56 say that's a hard take? Zoey deleted her twitter? Zoey deleted Zoey deleted her twitter? Well she
01:35:00 deactivated and reactivated it now it's private okay fair enough okay from what I understand at
01:35:07 least it could have changed again like people like people okay everyone was really mad at Zoey
01:35:11 and at first I was like man this is terrible a man died but then the reports roll in people
01:35:17 corroborate Zoey's story Scott corroborates Zoey's story Scott describes a whole culture of people
01:35:23 around Alec that he treated in exactly this way Alec's sister says yeah this is pretty much what
01:35:28 Alex was like Scott says like like my whole the whole time that I knew Alec he was like a
01:35:34 horribly abusive person he like you know he was always really secretive and cagey about stuff
01:35:39 he literally gave him PTSD from the fucking shit he put it yeah Scott has Scott has PTSD
01:35:45 but kind of makes you wonder why he worked with the guy if this is all well it's because Alec had
01:35:50 clout okay it's literally because Alec had clout and uh I don't know he used it to fucking
01:35:56 he uh you should you should read Scott's art Scott's I've not read Scott's post which might
01:36:01 recontextualize a lot of my understanding of the issue so far um okay if you if you were initially
01:36:07 on the side of like the cancel culture gone too far I get it I don't know shit that was my that was
01:36:13 my take two but like after reading after reading Scott's post no I mean no this is good this is
01:36:19 great thank you thank you Zoey I will not I will not go as far as saying I'm glad anybody's dead
01:36:24 is that just kind of like a hard and fast like I don't want anybody to die um okay I okay I wish
01:36:31 we I wish we could have rehabilitated him right that would have been better but I think it's pretty
01:36:35 clear that that wasn't gonna happen sure okay just in light of and he was a bad guy I mean look I mean
01:36:41 it sounds like we're I'm not saying she's lying or anything I'm definitely not implying I don't know
01:36:47 anything about the situation I all I know is mostly what you said but yeah it's kind of like easy to
01:36:52 throw shade at a person when they're dead and they're not there to defend themselves I mean it's
01:36:57 kind of I mean it's almost admitting to your guilt when you you kill yourself because I guess you
01:37:01 assume you there's no way to defend yourself but at the same time but the same time you could you
01:37:07 could have just felt like you know there was no way out there maybe some mental issues or whatever
01:37:11 it's not necessarily his guilt and maybe just some people had it out for him and you know they're
01:37:15 talking about the mob the mob I've seen so many people talk trash about Stanley after he died I
01:37:21 don't believe that that shit but I mean that's a whole other point just recently she also I mean
01:37:26 I mean I don't think anybody can deny the fact that like Twitter is enabling a lot of bullshit
01:37:33 you know the fact that like they're you just you can sick the mob on whoever you want without
01:37:38 any evidence or anything like that and that's kind of the really creepy thing Zoe in their
01:37:43 post Zoe said in their post that this was that they forgave Alex right for all the stuff that they
01:37:50 said interesting isn't that fuck but isn't that weird well here's the thing but why I have always
01:37:56 I assume from the get-go with the statement from Alex sister that this did happen to some degree
01:38:01 whether it was as extreme as Zoe was saying who knows Zoe has a history of coloring the truth
01:38:07 to her benefit but it sounded if your own sister is not coming out playing defense hard there's
01:38:13 probably some grounds for like legitimacy there but the thing this is this is an example of a
01:38:19 piece of shit being a piece of shit to another piece of shit because Zoe Quinn has a history of
01:38:25 doing fucking ridiculous shit and the whole reason that this even happened in my opinion is that she
01:38:30 was getting a bunch of flak for not delivering on the Kickstarter and this was a smoke screen
01:38:34 especially when it was 10 years removed and she said in the very statement that I forgive this
01:38:39 person and I don't want gave him and I don't want anything I don't want anybody to go after him I
01:38:44 just needed to get this off my chest it was a way of deflecting before it even took off
01:38:50 I don't want to defend Zoe Quinn because Zoe Quinn doesn't seem like a particularly great person
01:38:55 either but like even if you ignore what she said like the fact that the fact that like lots of other
01:39:02 people and women and Scott Benson came out and said like yeah I want to I want to look this this
01:39:08 is I just want to quickly say everything this person says yeah I just want to quickly say I'm
01:39:11 not saying that everything said about him was a lie no I don't believe that like he he does sound
01:39:16 like he might have you know done something to upset people and maybe you know harm them and what
01:39:20 not maybe he definitely did well we don't know he's not here to tell his side of the story that's
01:39:26 my point it's kind of remember when we were all convinced about allegedly the torrents and torrents
01:39:33 of people coming out to allege the abuses done by one pro Jared right that all of which fell away
01:39:40 and the only two substantiated ones were basically revealed to be at the one very likely just made
01:39:46 up and the other totally like we can't verify it at all so look I'm not saying that they're not true
01:39:52 I'm saying we should just wait for the fucking facts and like that's what are these actual
01:39:57 accounts that people are making look no what what like the thing you just said Scott's account
01:40:01 that's a very biased source in this whole affair what do you mean that's a biased source I that's
01:40:06 exactly what I mean he's a very biased source if he was given everyone's a biased source well
01:40:12 that doesn't mean the facts don't exist literally no one point to even one person that has come out
01:40:18 and said I knew Scott he was not like this nobody look my point is very uncontroversial nobody says
01:40:25 that my point is I mean given our recent events shouldn't we just every every everyone is like
01:40:31 yep I knew Scott he sure was weird around women we kind of had this thing that we all said like
01:40:36 don't be in a room then I would challenge you actually present me a list of the people doing
01:40:41 that and show me the evidence here's a problem maybe I will do here's here's the problem I have
01:40:45 with that you know everybody the the narrative with these stories is always someone comes out
01:40:53 and makes an accusation and then all of a sudden there's a torrent of people coming out and saying
01:40:57 yeah me too this happened to me too and like why wait this is exactly what happened to projaret
01:41:03 why are we waiting so long for this like like if we all knew that this guy was a monster for this
01:41:09 long why did we wait so long for it to happen do something about it like at this point it is
01:41:15 partially your fault for sitting on it for x amount of years and just letting it continue to happen
01:41:20 when is personal responsibility coming to the equation what do you mean personal okay I mean
01:41:24 distance yourself from the psychopath she's not responsible don't work with him I'm not talking
01:41:31 about Zoe I'm saying like if you're if you're a three person team and one of those people is
01:41:35 mentally unstable don't wait until some random person brings up baggage from 10 years ago to
01:41:40 finally pull the plug on him do it immediately okay well Scott I mean Scott the only reason that you
01:41:46 have lived in like a different country from alex right Scott didn't know about like alex personal
01:41:52 but you just said that he has PTSD from him well that's well yeah then not not from not from his
01:41:58 experience maybe stop working for him maybe stop working with him before you get PTSD this is such a
01:42:04 okay this is okay what he describes is a whole pattern of behavior whereby alex uses his clout
01:42:10 to like get people working for him like get people dependent on him and then abuse them look Ben
01:42:16 like this is that strategy I'm not even saying I don't believe you or I don't believe any of these
01:42:20 people I haven't reviewed most of the documents I don't know anything about who's made what claims
01:42:24 but I just think my position is simply I should probably find out as much information how many
01:42:30 of these accounts seem you know and I just want to know if they're credible or not I'm not saying
01:42:34 they're not I definitely just don't have enough and considering what just happened with projared
01:42:39 shouldn't we just I mean at the very least for me I'm speaking just for myself I should probably
01:42:43 wait before I'm like yep it seems all right all right you can wait listen I've heard I've heard
01:42:48 I've heard enough multiple independent sources also the same thing I'm just gonna say ala caloka
01:42:53 fuck you it's it's you know wish you could have been reformed you weren't gonna be reformed I'm glad
01:42:57 you're dead and I'm 100 positive that we will not be hearing anything that indicates to the contrary
01:43:03 it was a scumbag everyone in the industry knew it and that okay it's already it's already it's
01:43:09 everybody in the industry who knew pairs bears partial responsibility for not acting out sooner
01:43:15 is all I mean fucking weird victim blaming it's not victim blaming at all it's just stating effect
01:43:21 I just find it weird that everyone if Zoe Quinn is a hero for stepping forward then everyone else who
01:43:26 did it is a valet because he killed himself as instead of defend himself because like what are we
01:43:31 supposed to make about like oh boy I what I bet he would have had a great fucking defense he would
01:43:36 have had like a great like projared level like here's how I can disprove all my acute if only
01:43:42 he hadn't killed himself then we would know the truth no bullshit that doesn't mean he was completely
01:43:46 guilty of everything just because he did that it's just a it's part of the story I agree it's also
01:43:51 the court of public opinion has too much power something because of social media and it's dangerous
01:43:55 the court of public opinion what did the court of public opinion did not kill alex haloka no but
01:44:01 we really don't know the court of public opinion made made its judgment without and without a
01:44:06 public opinion and the court of public opinion didn't and the court of public
01:44:10 no stop this is ridiculous the court of public opinion literally did nothing to him
01:44:15 scott scott brought him up for he didn't fire him because alex was not an employee they were a team
01:44:21 and and alex had not been working on the project already for a while he'd been distant from the
01:44:25 project for a while and scott didn't even like him because he was like person like on a personal
01:44:31 level alex was like not good to scott so like the court of public opinion didn't fire alex
01:44:36 didn't kill alex didn't do anything to him he fucking killed himself so if if me and all my
01:44:41 he's the soul of my classmates at school we bully one kid we don't like and we all do it a little
01:44:46 bit but it's just enough that collectively he kills himself we all bear zero responsibility
01:44:51 across the board are you calling this bullying yes
01:45:02 i mean i think that seems one one word among others that could be used to describe it
01:45:07 i mean i don't obviously there's a there's a there's a morality attached to the term bullying
01:45:12 that the people doing it must be all evil and the people being okay must be all good well like
01:45:17 how if someone kills so if someone kills themselves like are you gonna like you what
01:45:23 there's a it just makes sense to examine the facts when someone kills themselves and determine why
01:45:29 they did it and you know maybe there was some fucked up situation going on there i have a
01:45:33 people deserve accountability i have a small story i want to that'd be bad so i mean it's
01:45:37 probably not all made up so good okay let's find out exactly where it all is like i don't even feel
01:45:42 like i should be commenting because i don't have anything to say i haven't done any research i'm
01:45:46 simply stating facts are good i will make up my decision once i get more facts and i want to
01:45:51 i want to quickly i want to share a story right okay i want to quickly i got a lot of them and
01:45:56 i've made up my mind and i think it's very well substantiated okay well i mean your problem what
01:46:00 what opinion you have like a bead nates or bead bends it doesn't really matter the things are the
01:46:05 way things are and whatever you think isn't going to change anything however um i want to quickly
01:46:10 say a story like with the situation it's very complicated it's hard to tell what what's the
01:46:15 truth and what's not and uh you know like i'm a bit with a date i would prefer to you know more
01:46:20 know more facts than you know make up my mind or whatever remember pro jared yeah i know it's not
01:46:27 the same from the very beginning there were conflicting reports about pro jared you all
01:46:31 just weren't paying attention that's possible i i'm still not paying attention to pro jared i'm
01:46:36 avoiding that as much as as i can anywho uh there was this story about this one girl that you might
01:46:42 have heard uh in uh not saying this is like the same it's definitely not the same it's a lot
01:46:48 clear more clear cut i suppose of the situation but um she drew fanard of rose quartz and she was too
01:46:54 thin and she got so bullied by everyone she was such an evil person and her way out was to try and
01:46:59 commit suicide thankfully she survived but if she had went through it and died would have that made
01:47:05 her guilty i mean i mean no like what's what's the what's the parallel the parallel is that
01:47:13 there's a calculus that i think everyone's doing here that's how much of a crime how much of a
01:47:19 moral crime did the person commit versus what's an appropriate i don't know social backlash and
01:47:24 obviously yeah there's different degrees you're illustrating the point the difference is that
01:47:28 alex actually was like a really bad guy and like lots whereas this person didn't fucking do nothing
01:47:36 these are like opposites i mean these are not people have claimed that this person was awful
01:47:41 in our eyes they weren't wrong well yeah and maybe like some of some of the people who are claiming
01:47:46 that this guy was awful are wrong that's my point i mean i don't know if they're wrong they might they
01:47:51 don't seem to be wrong yeah and they might not be wrong they might they might actually be honest
01:47:55 but it's just i don't like the way the situation has panned out i suppose that's my point and i can't
01:48:02 really trust them in this situation necessarily so i reserve my opinion on this whole situation
01:48:09 well who are you who are you choose who exactly are you choosing not to believe
01:48:13 no one i don't it's just i don't like the way it's such a big mess you don't like the
01:48:18 you hadn't even heard about this since then you're so fucking weird ben you're like oh my god
01:48:23 you haven't looked into the facts and haven't formed an opinion yet that's fucked up man like
01:48:29 you haven't looked into the facts and you're formulating an objection her objection is she
01:48:32 doesn't know yeah that's not her objection what is your objection is let's your rejection is let's not
01:48:38 jump to conclusions without the information and i'm saying i actually have a lot of really good
01:48:42 information yeah but yeah but you're leaning one way and i have your story i have but i haven't
01:48:48 heard the other part of the story therefore i don't want to make an assumption or you know
01:48:53 make us a solid opinion about the situation just yet i think they could be wrong they might
01:48:58 that's i mean that's fair there might more information i feel attacked i feel attacked for
01:49:03 my opinion okay then listen i don't i'm saying it's it's fine the way you you think i'm just i'm
01:49:08 not agreeing with you but i'm not exactly disagreeing with you either i just think there might be more
01:49:13 facts that might come out there might not be more facts you might be right you might be wrong i don't
01:49:17 know that's my point there's there's okay i i also felt i also felt sympathy i i guess my final word
01:49:25 on the subject i also felt sympathy for alex and i thought boy what if what if zoe was lying like
01:49:32 that would be so bad like that would be a really terrible thing that happened and then i read scott's
01:49:35 article and i was like wow fuck me dude i don't i don't even feel sympathy i reserve all feelings
01:49:44 until i have facts one way or the other and so yeah i'm just i'm saying this for the benefit of
01:49:48 the viewer if you're listening to me and you're like wow wow ben how dare you like good better off
01:49:55 dead that's a yikes statement go read alex's go read alex's article and then tell me what you
01:49:59 think to me to me is always like the boy who cried wolf i can't and like scott scott's article not alex
01:50:05 i keep confusing scott is the one that wrote the article yeah with like like i was saying like
01:50:09 zoe the boy who cried wolf i can't really believe her other people i might actually you know look
01:50:14 into it and see what they're saying and then reserve my judgment um yeah zoe seems kind of
01:50:20 questionable scott's a scott's a good boy i mean if committing yourself if committing suicide is
01:50:26 sign of a guilty conscience what is do you know privating your twitter or whatever is that all
01:50:30 suicide in the gill i i don't i don't know what does well does that mean that contra points is
01:50:34 guilty you tell me i don't know it's also private i mean i don't think so but other people seem to
01:50:40 what is what i mean that was the point you made like he killed himself isn't that suspicious i don't
01:50:44 understand i don't understand this because you're you're taking two things that you have the opposite
01:50:48 yes ben because one is the depiction of your point that i'm making for the sake of to show the
01:50:53 fallacy in the argument that that does not necessarily imply anything high i mean killing
01:50:58 yourself doesn't prove you're guilty i agree no part of your you're you're saying that oh killing
01:51:03 yourself seems like an admission of guilt but isn't deleting your twitter also that but it's not
01:51:10 if it's but if it is for zoe then it is for contra points it's it's you know what it doesn't
01:51:14 matter it's not retreating away from you know the public eye isn't necessarily admission of guilt
01:51:20 some people might say but i mean that's what pro jarid did pro jarid retreated from the public
01:51:24 guy for a while and then he came back and he made a video and everyone's like oh i get like i'll get
01:51:28 i'll give zoe that i don't think it's an admission of guilt like being bombarded by a lot of people
01:51:32 who you probably say kill yourself and other awful things you know that that's not fun so you know
01:51:37 just just uh you can private your twitter and that's what you probably did and that's you know
01:51:41 that's fine i don't know that i don't think that makes her guilty of anything that specific moment
01:51:47 of course anyway hey how about those voice mails uh
01:51:51 it's getting fantastic i raise this game okay this is the inception point for gamer gay too
01:51:57 all right it's coming i specifically asked not to make this podcast three hours and we're almost
01:52:01 two hours and then like the voice mails are probably gonna be like i don't know one hour so
01:52:05 well i mean how many of us bitch and complain when the episode goes long mage huh it's almost like
01:52:09 the episodes do that sometimes yeah i'm not i'm not complaining i just i really hope was hoping to
01:52:15 make it a bit shorter this time i was too but i fucked it up well it doesn't matter in any case
01:52:21 we've have the voice mails i fucked i fucked up and gave our listeners even more of the great
01:52:25 content they crave those poor bastards i was really hoping that this episode we could avoid
01:52:30 politics but no ben was here oh wine wine wine wine wine get go well go back to last episode
01:52:37 and get in the comments and say uh thank goodness thank goodness that they shut ben down from talking
01:52:42 about politics oh whenever he says any whenever he has an opinion about anything i just get so
01:52:46 fucking mad because he doesn't agree with me about anything that's politics is things that
01:52:50 don't agree with me i saw that i saw that one comment like somebody i saw you i think you
01:52:54 responded to or something this some guy was like thank god nate shut bet down when when did i shut
01:52:58 ben down i don't remember i don't okay it didn't happen i went really mad at i got really mad at
01:53:02 that guy yeah i don't even think he was the worst one i feel i was really mad at him yeah i don't
01:53:07 know i don't it's true i did not i i tried to avoid escalating in like a negative way i did you
01:53:12 know that's true i guess there was another yeah okay so that guy i'm a little sorry that i got so
01:53:17 mad at you but not really like fuck you man like get fucked right and then there was another guy
01:53:23 fidelio i don't know what fidelio fidel i don't know what your problem is because you see him like
01:53:27 a comrade right you seem like a comrade who just doesn't give a shit about like identity politics
01:53:33 yeah and this and this guy and this guy is like he's like a purely an economic driven he doesn't
01:53:37 care about the social aspect like that's the sense i get that this is a guy who's like steeped in
01:53:41 economic theory or something and he doesn't give a shit about anything else and so he's down there
01:53:46 in the comments like uh the fact that ben went to protest the straight pride parade just proves
01:53:51 that he's just a larper and he's not and he's not for real like he's like it's like he didn't even
01:53:55 pull a gun on them ben you fucking pussy you could make you like oh wait he went out and he went out
01:54:01 and actually did a thing well that just proves that he doesn't actually he's not actually doing
01:54:06 so much for the tolerant left am i right for the tolerant left why don't you read chomsky you
01:54:11 fuck okay i should probably read chomsky listen hey you know what i got i read conquest of bread
01:54:16 i just read the i just read the the communist manifesto it was really short uh maybe i'll
01:54:21 read chomsky next i don't know i'd be interested to hear i want to read bakunin i i just got a
01:54:26 book of my own i don't have a lot of these but i got a book um it's the vision of the anointed
01:54:31 by tomas soul you know tomas soul i know the name i forget he's a he's a libertarian guy and this is
01:54:38 a book as i understand it about how like top down governance is uh is in his view suboptimal
01:54:45 subideal and so i'm curious to see uh what he has to say i've i've read like one page so far
01:54:50 but uh he seems like a smart guy he's not like a smart guy so i'm gonna give him one page seems
01:54:54 like a smart guy can write some i mean from the other experience i have tom come on i'm gonna fucking

01:58:51 number two this one's from scumbag chris okay here we go three two one go three two one go
01:59:00 go there is no such thing as human core i thought about this two podcasts ago it was
01:59:07 two chickens hit to make a reaction however after hearing the absolutely worthless voicemails of
01:59:12 most recent pcp i knew i had to set the record straight thank munchy what you said was wrong
01:59:18 humans did not invent agriculture ants have been cultivating fungus for millions of years
01:59:23 and many even keep aphids as a sort of insect cattle and it was while i was sticky pre-nap
01:59:29 wank come at the peak of my kenja taimu or postnat clarity i realized there is nothing humans have
01:59:36 invented that wasn't done by animals long before us clothing bagworms war ants again art birds even
01:59:45 what i had at one time believed to be the most human core activity suicide bombing is a tactic
01:59:50 employed by ants humans aren't special we're just another animal and i am frankly disgusted by the
01:59:56 lack of creativity or genuine achievements we've had as a whole it is for that reason that i have
02:00:01 decided to give up my dreams of being an artist renounce my humanity and begin living life as an
02:00:07 ant along with the colony aren't aren't we all just ants living in the ant hill known as society
02:00:16 i i think he's saying he's going to suicide bomb pcph that's fair probably that's fair uh at least
02:00:23 we haven't wouldn't have to listen to you terrible voicemails anymore speaking of which uh we got
02:00:27 another call from human human core human core is human core are things that humans humans humans
02:00:35 must sabotage themselves humans sabotage themselves in specific way i feel like they're
02:00:41 i feel like they're they're a particular failings that humans are are subject to space uh no whether
02:00:48 or not they would if they could there are water bears on the moon that have been living there for
02:00:53 like fucking bajillion years what are you talking about oh wait a minute that's like a tv show ha ha
02:00:58 no that's that's a real fucking thing wait all right it's obviously a lie no there's no there's
02:01:04 little animals like fucking weird little creatures that are co-weekly known as water bears and they're
02:01:08 the most like resilient animal of all time they can resist like nuclear explosions and
02:01:13 shit and can survive in the depths of space and they found them on the moon because like they've
02:01:18 just been flung out into the fucking void and they're just on the moon now look at look at this uh uh
02:01:25 audio links audio links look at this shit i've seen so we don't even get that we don't even get
02:01:30 space travel they they're already forming starfleet without us damn it well if they were already on
02:01:36 the moon to begin with it's not like they traveled through space they hitched a ride on the moon or
02:01:40 something we're hitching a ride on a fucking rocket yeah yeah yeah it was a like a rocket
02:01:45 that crashed on the moon like had it's god's rocket hmm okay well all right pretty cool water
02:01:51 bears pretty cool all right we can't do anything we suck as a species uh but they're just so
02:01:56 fucking resilient they can survive in the vacuum these are the things that live for like millennia
02:02:01 and just like don't they must be like completely they're not parasites yeah i'm just saying if
02:02:06 we're gonna start doing some dna splicing i think water bears a good place to start you know
02:02:11 probably true they're not they don't look like bears i don't have you guys ever uh
02:02:16 have you ever heard a manga called terraformars you know you know what i'm talking about i've
02:02:20 heard of it yes it's okay it's a great series i mean it's it's interesting i like it and it's about
02:02:25 um basically they they colonize they're trying to colonize mars humanity i i believe it's mars
02:02:30 and they get there and um they they were trying to terraform the planet and the way they were like
02:02:36 testing it to see if it could sustain life or something like that was to use cockroaches
02:02:40 so they left a ton of cockroaches there but when like humans come back to like check on the progress
02:02:44 of the terraforming the cockroaches have mutated and it is big hulking freakish like black monsters
02:02:50 that are super strong in fact let me let me get a picture uh terraformars attack on cockroach
02:02:57 that's basically what it is that's basically when there's a there's a there's a show now too um okay
02:03:01 look at this guy this is what i'm talking about first episode of this back when it was airing
02:03:06 i i never watched it but i like the anime and they are yeah yeah they are um spooky yucky boys
02:03:12 damn seeing these they uh so the point was like the human beings however who go to colonize the
02:03:18 planet they're they're pretty scary they are absolutely terrifying and uh look at the look
02:03:23 at this happy guy he's having a fun time this cockroach man yeah they're not fun right okay okay
02:03:29 point no thank you the humans uh who come to fight them each of those humans
02:03:34 are given like a specific bug power to like fight against them like what like the main character
02:03:39 guy he gets like sick like wasp butt punching gloves or he can like sting ya and he's got bug
02:03:44 superpowers and everybody gets like a different bug power and it's pretty cool shonen stuff um
02:03:49 but uh what if we gave water bear powers that would be a pretty sick one that's just becoming god
02:03:55 you'd you'd literally be indestructible invincible it's literally just like curvy rock power you know
02:04:00 that's a pretty good power but then you can get grabbed in smash and thrown so that maybe it's not
02:04:04 so good after all uh well regardless let's check in voicemail number three all right we're gonna
02:04:10 count it down mage why did you send me this pad on the head uh because you said you were feeling
02:04:15 attacked and i didn't say that that's true that's true i feel i feel a little bad i feel a little
02:04:21 bad i feel like maybe i went a little too far to say that like it's good that he died it's not
02:04:26 good that he died it's sad but i also feel like humanity is better off without people like him
02:04:32 is there is that i mean i feel both of these things at the same time hey you feel how you feel
02:04:36 and i understand that position like i don't i'm not exactly thrilled when like murderer i mean it's
02:04:41 sad when like a murderer exists because like sure wish he was not like it is like it's tragic right
02:04:46 like it is tragic when anyone dies right like it's a tear it's a terrible thing not everybody
02:04:51 i mean some people i'm glad that not everyone but yeah i mean some less than others you know
02:04:55 alex is okay i i don't know there's a spectrum of how sad my scott's account he just seemed really
02:05:00 bad just seemed really bad and i don't you know i don't want to i haven't looked into the sky like
02:05:03 i i've known i've known people i've known people that he reminds me of and i just think they suck
02:05:09 all right fair enough that's what i think i think it's a fair enough uh feeling to feel like uh world
02:05:13 would be better off with it without certain people but it's always a tragedy when someone has to die
02:05:19 yeah yeah that's how i feel yeah that's how that's exactly how i feel okay next voicemail we got a

02:10:08 good okay three two one go just in case there's small chance that this didn't come up on the
02:10:16 podcast i'm giving you the opportunity now all right all right that's that's okay ladies and gentlemen
02:10:29 thank you for uh reminding us we did in fact discuss sand he's a good boy i left that in as a fail
02:10:34 safe he does say some stuff oh what do you say he says i missed it i think he just said ladies and
02:10:40 gentlemen he's oh yeah okay all right good good good i mean true true and it feels good it feels
02:10:45 damn good it is a weird i feel like sands is the only assist trophy in history to be celebrated
02:10:52 i think every the other one is not an assist trophy he's not an assist trophy he's a fighter
02:10:55 costume actually an assist trophy would kind of be better i mean sort of g gino is pretty excited
02:11:01 he's he's a as a as a me costume i mean guys like me that that's what sands is too right yeah
02:11:07 yeah that's true but i mean i'm saying that like when when gino gino got in at the same time that
02:11:10 cloud was announced in smash four and i actually don't think gino is a me costume and smash ultimate
02:11:17 currently which i think is why people keep alive the hope that he could uh he could really get in
02:11:23 yeah so i mean that's by the way i i you know what i'm glad this came out because i almost forgot
02:11:26 to say did you guys know that this is actually by far the most important announcement except
02:11:31 maybe for sands but in that direct it's that they they stated you know it was a it was a they were
02:11:35 gonna make five dlc playable characters for smash they just blew the door up they're like nah
02:11:40 fuck that we're gonna make more dlc we're not stopping at five we'll go as long as we like we
02:11:44 like money so i mean yeah doors open boys we it's no longer just one and done we don't have to fight
02:11:50 between the steve idiots uh the the doom guy bros the the ramu fags you know it could be anybody
02:11:58 it could be a doom guy like what what if it's one of the demons like the dude the dude one
02:12:03 like like the beholder with just the one eye he just floats around i would love bolder
02:12:08 which cacodemon trophy or something i want i want the dude skeleton cacodemon trophy
02:12:13 trumpet guys uh oh man so many possible i found i found i found the tongue twister
02:12:21 you did yeah the german one can you pronounce it uh hold on i'm good i i can i can try okay uh this
02:12:29 is what it's written um fishers oh god uh fishes fritz fish frishe fish frishe fish fish fish
02:12:37 frishe fritz oh that's terrible wow what does it mean like fresh fish yeah what's it mean it's uh
02:12:44 hold on um the fisherman fritz fishes for fresh fish uh fresh fish is what the fisherman fritz
02:12:53 fishes okay okay okay yeah pretty good i like it it's good i wonder what the russian one is well
02:13:00 one one day maybe it sounds like a lapino one i'd like to be similar but it's definitely not the
02:13:05 feeling but uh there's one tank just a lot i like showing off because no one can pronounce it yeah
02:13:11 yeah it is a rare thing uh by the way this just reminds me did you guys you probably haven't
02:13:16 seen this it was like on my trending tab on youtube or something i saw a fascinating video it was um
02:13:21 it was by what's his face is it tom scott that guy with like the blonde hair the british guy who
02:13:27 always wears like a red t-shirt is that you know what i'm talking about yeah he does oh wait is he
02:13:32 like a math guy yes primarily yes but yeah i think i know who he's just like a genius guy he's just
02:13:37 like a knowledge information guy yeah okay he did a video he did a video this was fascinating
02:13:43 where like there is a chart it's about languages there's there's a chart that exists about i'll
02:13:48 try to find this later it's about like do you have the video about all possible that's the one
02:13:54 language sounds that could exist but don't because if you like the human mouth has only so many
02:13:59 positions that we can move our tongue and like mandibles and fucking our palates to to make
02:14:04 different sound effects and like across all languages if you look at the chart there are
02:14:09 blank spots where like sounds could exist but like nobody uses them there are blacked out ones that
02:14:13 can't exist or whatever i'm confusing it there there's marks for symbols that do exist because
02:14:17 someone's trying to make an alphabet of like every human language so that every sound would be
02:14:22 accounted for but there are theoretical ones that could be used in languages based on position of
02:14:27 mouths but in no way have been in any languages yet and i just thought this was the most fascinating
02:14:33 concept that's neat that's neat as right right you should check it out made just my guess to watch
02:14:37 it it wasn't in my list to watch i'm subscribed to good tom scott i mean honestly i wasn't that
02:14:43 impressed by this guy this video blew me away i just thought it was so cool but uh there is
02:14:48 he always makes such beautiful videos but he does make cool stuff he does the video about the
02:14:52 youtube i think i saw his video about the youtube algorithm right i'd like to watch that i don't
02:14:56 know i think he's got a big popular one about the youtube algorithm maybe i've seen him i've seen
02:15:01 him in other ones too i like his videos about the tree that owns itself and there's another tree
02:15:05 that owns it yeah how's that is it is it fluttershy get it no wait the tree that owns itself yeah
02:15:13 how does that work i'm not owned i'm not owned i scream i'm shrinking into a small corn cup
02:15:20 how does that work mage if you if you can break it down i'm just curious it's a very short video
02:15:24 you should really look it up but it's like uh it's something a while ago some some landowner like
02:15:29 you gave the rights to the tree to own itself and like that's fascinating and like and like
02:15:34 people are honoring it but like a few a few like like kilometers or something i don't know how
02:15:39 but like a little bit ways away there's another tree that also owns itself but it's not as popular
02:15:44 as the first one so no one knows about that one lol overshadowed by his big bro that's hilarious
02:15:52 by the way i'm just i mean i'll just throw this out there while we're just discussing smash quickly
02:15:56 some guy a komodo komodo enesis two just tweeted at me is like what if we had a swordsman me hollow
02:16:02 night oh that'd be cool oh i would love that oh that'd be so sick wait digi's not here correct
02:16:08 or else i would rip him into him yeah for his video that he made about me on the radicalization
02:16:14 of ben i thought that was a hilarious video i did not agree with everything he was saying okay
02:16:19 i didn't agree yeah it's honestly it was pretty funny yeah there were some things i would have
02:16:24 objected to it wasn't all bad i guess but it wasn't all bad i wasn't really that mad with
02:16:28 anything did you say even though i disagreed with a couple of his characterizations but the the
02:16:32 question whoever did you get the feeling that whoever asked that question like hates my guts
02:16:38 um i did feel that they were definitely not a big fan yeah i definitely thought that like he said
02:16:44 i think the kind of questions like i love ben and i love his comics but and then he but i just
02:16:48 think that he's like the scum of the air he did not go back and he's clearly just okay okay he he
02:16:54 brings up like he brings up like some specific shit like he specifically talks about like the house
02:16:59 that i live in and this is like stuff that i don't know why this is relevant to anyone and i wonder
02:17:05 if i know this person personally because i have someone in mind it's hargadine it's hargadine
02:17:11 no no no there's another there's another person i know in real life who has been to my house and
02:17:16 who i know is a fan of digi and i and someone said huh what if it was that guy and i was what it
02:17:21 could be it could be you know that that's possible i don't i don't know i feel like someone uh could
02:17:26 have not not to not to quash the dream just the way the tone was asked was strange to me and i was
02:17:31 like this feels like weirdly personal i think it's theoretically possible someone and i personally
02:17:37 think it's the more likely thing that someone just from hearing what you said about like living in
02:17:41 like a big house with like trying to you know keep the rent low because you split it with a
02:17:44 bunch of people like that in my house i like living with my friends with this question asks
02:17:49 it's like oh ben's just mad because he has to squat in the house with a bunch of guys and a bunch of
02:17:54 dirty you know i got he lives in squalor maybe maybe someone who's christ maybe someone who doesn't
02:17:59 agree with you on everything i i saw perhaps more of what i thought his point was which was kind of
02:18:04 like like given the way you choose to live your life that more aligns with like you know more like
02:18:10 leftist mentality on like i mean i don't know maybe maybe it does maybe it does i don't know i felt
02:18:16 that i felt the question was really hostile well i mean did you answer i don't completely agree with
02:18:20 it but i don't it's like whatever it's fine you should ask that person though i mean i'd be
02:18:24 fascinated here if it's actually he didn't say who it was i mean you should you should you should
02:18:28 grill them maybe suddenly try what conversations i'm out and suddenly like oh did you sure made
02:18:32 a funny video about me haha don't you think so friend no he's not he's not talking to me he thinks
02:18:37 he thinks i'll murder him real is it good he thinks you're gonna revolution on his ass so he
02:18:41 thinks socialism will literally kill him um he thinks he thinks that i want to personally execute
02:18:47 well it sounds like he's just misinformed about your particular beliefs he's i told like that's
02:18:51 not he's just he's just one listen you know it sounds this sounds to me like a guy not i don't
02:18:56 i don't know him but uh it sounds like he's a little bit too like he thinks that you know he's
02:19:01 heard the memes of socialism death that count or whatever and he's like oh that means me i'm gonna
02:19:06 be death counted or something by i don't know that's that's my guess this this was a this was a guy
02:19:11 i don't know if i really i don't want to i don't want to talk about this guy specifically whatever
02:19:15 but that's that's that is amusing regardless um yes so i mean did anyone else get the feeling
02:19:21 probably not him odds are it's not him but wouldn't it be funny if it was and i was like ah now i
02:19:25 understand everything the context is all that you know about the video though like about the digits
02:19:30 video like i thought it was i really feel like look we all see the world and we see the things that
02:19:35 like we are most attracted to and like yes you've done like interesting marketing things by occasionally
02:19:41 throwing a few dollars to like advertise your your things somewhere but like did you whole thing
02:19:45 about like marketing i feel was him being like this is how i see the world ben must be this way too
02:19:51 so this is my i think it was a little bit of projection yeah that's the right like okay the
02:19:55 fact like it's not like in a way it's true that like everything you do in public is marketing yeah
02:20:02 right like in a certain sense it's unavoidably true that that ever that i am marketing myself
02:20:10 but that's like a really broad like the part that i object to is that he said
02:20:13 there's a part where he sort of implies that i like i saw people succeeding on the left and
02:20:18 i saw that there was money to be made i mean yeah he did kind of like that's not like i have i don't
02:20:23 know like i mean you'd have yeah i guess i guess there are some people like that but like i don't
02:20:30 think it's like a huge like money mill i don't think there's like and i certainly haven't like
02:20:36 done anything to make money in that way so i don't know that's that that's the one thing that
02:20:42 i'd be like no that's just wrong everything else whatever it's yeah i don't think you said anything
02:20:46 particularly me i just i just thought like i mean me knowing you i was like ben seems pretty sincere
02:20:50 i mean i don't think he's you know i don't know yeah did you didn't did you didn't say like oh ben's
02:20:56 not sincere but i feel like a lot of the comments like read like heard him as saying like ben's not
02:21:04 sincere a lot of the comments are your typical stupid you crit you you criticize capitalism
02:21:09 even though i mean ever considered the fact that not all of them are like that but a lot of them
02:21:14 are unironically that's silly because to go back to what we were saying earlier is like if you're
02:21:20 trying to like score lefty points to get more money the last thing you want to do is come on a
02:21:24 podcast like this like that's just putting it i mean well i mean to be fair ben is making money
02:21:29 by being here so there is a resistance to just no but i mean if you're trying to make money off
02:21:33 like the left narrative and like being a lefty guy to make that long-term transition yeah you're
02:21:38 just setting yourself up to like like do i want to just tag tie this huge ball and chain around
02:21:43 my left leg right now you know like it's not a good idea but if there's a space for like a
02:21:47 hardcore like kind of free speech also very lefty person that seems i don't know if that market
02:21:52 really exists though uh they're just what about uh what about look well there's a lot of slovoi slovoi
02:21:58 zizek yo well yeah yeah okay there you go slovoi zizeks like that there's um you know the dirt the
02:22:04 dirtbag left the dirtbag left is all the dirtbag left there's there's lefties that say retarded
02:22:10 and stuff you know they exist yeah that's fair uh okay all right i've seen some of them in the wild
02:22:16 so we've got one last voicemail now this one isn't like a normal voicemail it's more of a someone
