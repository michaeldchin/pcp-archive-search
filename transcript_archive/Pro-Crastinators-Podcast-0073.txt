00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast, the only podcast
00:00:28 with me, the best guy ever, and nobody else. I am the best guy ever. Welcome to The Pro Crastinators
00:00:33 Podcast. We're the best guy ever. Yeah, I'd say Munchy's here. What's up Munchy?
00:00:38 Um, um, hey, hey, everyone. What's going on in here? I just came in off the street where
00:00:44 I slept last night. How's it hanging? Oh my god.
00:00:48 That madman, that trickster god Ben Saint is here. We've got Mumkey Jones.
00:00:55 Hey everybody, I like video games. Also Tom Oliver.
00:01:01 Sup beautiful bastards. Hope you're having a fantastic time now. Welcome back to the Tommy
00:01:06 Oliver Show and let's just jump into it. Tom, these come out on Sundays, not Saturdays.
00:01:12 You already fucked it. It's a Saturday when I'm recording it and that's the only day
00:01:15 that I care about. That's true. That's true. We're men who live in the day, the here and
00:01:20 now, we don't live in the future. I live in the present. I don't concern myself with petty
00:01:23 things like the future. Yeah. Fuck that. So if you remember a way back to episode one
00:01:28 of the procrastinators podcast, we talked about the best game ever undisputedly undertale
00:01:35 as we all agree. And it's time to revisit that issue by talking about the greatest game
00:01:42 console of all time. We're talking consoles people of all of all makes models and builds.
00:01:48 And let's let's check in with our friends over at Urban Dictionary to read what a console
00:01:52 is. Okay, actually, these definitions are terrible. These people are not my friends.
00:01:57 I just want to disclaimer that I do not associate with them. Oh, Urban Dictionary. Yeah. Oh,
00:02:03 here we go. My enemies console definition number two on Urban Dictionary, a computer
00:02:07 intended for limited user interaction, such as the NES or the PlayStation. Such computers
00:02:13 are intended only for loading single programs in one session, although newer consoles are
00:02:17 able to perform such feats as getting on the internet networking between other consoles
00:02:21 of the same type. I'm a fucking nerd. Even I hate this guy. Holy common input devices
00:02:27 for consoles include controllers also called paddles sometimes joysticks or arcade pads.
00:02:33 Who calls a controller a paddle? What is that? Okay, doesn't matter. I wrote this, aka retard.
00:02:38 Maybe the same people that call levels boards. What the fuck? Is that a real thing? Yeah.
00:02:44 Yeah. Danny on game drums would always call it if he would get a free man and he would
00:02:48 clear the board. I mean, I love the free man thing, but I've never heard this. Dude,
00:02:52 when I would play fucking brawl with my cousin, he would be like, oh, dude, oh, dude, I love
00:02:56 this map. I love this fucking map. It's a stage. You know, the map on a little bit more
00:03:01 sympathetic. No, the game specifically calls it a stage. Yeah. It says choose your stage.
00:03:07 Oh, I love this map. Oh, get fucked. Yeah, you just get reamed in the middle of an IHOP.
00:03:12 Like you do. I read in your mind. I know you want to. Okay, fair point. Fair point.
00:03:19 To start us off, now we, this whole topic was suggested by our dear friend, Tom Oliver,
00:03:23 rest in peace, who suggested that we discuss the greatest. Has he killed himself since
00:03:28 we recorded this? I'm always thinking about it, man. You never know. Check out a monkey
00:03:35 and Tom's suicide packed video or whatever. Yeah, that's what it's called. That'll be
00:03:40 the last episode. We'll be called then. Right, of course. So Tom was just talking about how
00:03:45 great the GBA was. And I believe that takes his spot for the greatest game console of all
00:03:49 time. Indeed. It's a tough battle. You know, a lot of people, Tom, oh, sorry, go on. That's
00:03:53 all I was going to say. It's a tough battle, but GBA is number one in my book. Now I'm
00:03:57 sure a lot of people, when they hear you say that would immediately jump to the fact that,
00:04:02 but, but Tommy, it can't even play fucking Halo while I'm downloading terror flops of
00:04:09 child porn at the same time, like my PS4. What is your defense of this position? It's
00:04:15 baby shit console. Look, there's, there's serious Sam on the GBA due to course. Actually,
00:04:21 quite a few 3D games on the GBA, surprisingly enough. But no, I mean, the problem is like
00:04:28 the new new consoles, the kids these days, with their fucking multimedia consoles,
00:04:33 consoles have like jumped the plot and forgotten what the point is playing fucking games,
00:04:37 all right. PS4 had all these goddamn channels, you could watch YouTube on it. But how long
00:04:41 could you only play Bloodborne and nothing else? It's fucking bullshit.
00:04:44 Long time.
00:04:45 The GBA launched with a fucking kick ass lineup of games and it only got better. And that's what
00:04:50 these, I feel like everybody here is, is not retarded when it comes to gaming consoles. So I
00:04:55 feel like even though I'm sure some of you won't agree, the GBA is the best console. I'm pretty
00:04:59 sure none of you are going to have retarded choices like the PS4 or some gay shit like that.
00:05:02 That's going to be about consoles that play games and don't do much else.
00:05:07 Anything past the PS2, they don't even have identities anymore.
00:05:13 They just became like a weird conglomerate of...
00:05:16 One of the worst experiences of my gaming life was when I bought Metal Gear Solid 4.
00:05:26 I got the PlayStation 3 bundle with Metal Gear Solid 4. It was great. I plug it in.
00:05:30 And then as I'm starting it up, it's like legendary the setup time for Metal Gear Solid 4.
00:05:36 It was like the first moment when it's like, okay, things have gone terribly, terribly wrong
00:05:42 at some point. And this is the point I'm trying to make in general. The big consoles,
00:05:47 like the load times. I'm thinking about Bloodborne, for example. So I played Bloodborne right when it
00:05:51 came out, like Midnight Release. It was fucking great. And that was before they had patched the
00:05:57 little... You know, the loading screens and all the Dark Souls games held us show an item and a
00:06:02 description of a certain item in most of the Dark Demon blood games. So that Bloodborne,
00:06:10 when it first came out, didn't even have that. It just for the loading screens would just have
00:06:15 the word Bloodborne and nothing else. And of course, in that game, you do a ton of traveling
00:06:19 back to your home base. I know. It was absolutely unbelievable. The whole time I was screaming
00:06:23 about why they didn't have this thing from the others, which was just... It was kind of fun to
00:06:27 read the description of items while you waited for things to load in Dark Souls 1, 2, and whatever,
00:06:32 the ones that were out of the time. But they didn't have that. It fucking sucked. So my point is just
00:06:37 like, there's so much fucking loading that you have to suffer through to play these cutting-edge,
00:06:43 so beautiful, amazing games. But on the GBA and shit, there was so much less of that stuff,
00:06:48 because they really prioritized gameplay. And that is just something that's really been
00:06:53 sacrificed in a terrible way. Well, hang on. Well, GBA was a cartridge console,
00:06:57 and cartridges didn't even have loading times. There were a couple games on GBA that had loading,
00:07:04 and there's mostly the 3D ones, but there was only a couple seconds. But no, it's just...
00:07:07 See, that's my point, Ben. The fact that we were so obsessed with creating these big old
00:07:12 experiences where you have to load in a gigantic map and process all this data at once...
00:07:16 I feel like I'm going to get triggered and talk about my realism rant in games and how it's the
00:07:21 most cancerous thing ever made by mankind. It's inevitable. It's related to this. I want to hear
00:07:25 it. It's so fucking dumb. Honestly, because you're saying how everything after PS2 doesn't have an
00:07:32 identity. It's because this realism curse became a thing. How fucking sad is it that in the PS2,
00:07:39 you had Naughty Dog and Insomniac doing Ratchet and Clank and Jack and Daxter. And then the next
00:07:48 console cycle came along. It's like, oh, look at all these polys we can throw around. We're going
00:07:51 to make uncharted and fucking resistance, which are like bland fucking gay games that have no
00:07:57 personality. The kind of snapshot little zinger sentence I would say is, make art, don't make a
00:08:05 tech demo. Because when you make a realistic game, no matter how good it is, all you're making is a
00:08:10 snapshot of the technical limitations of the time. It ages terribly. It never looks cool.
00:08:15 But on the other hand, here's a perfect example of the shit when it started happening in the
00:08:20 PS2 era. Because PS2 and Xbox, the originals, is when they started to kind of like, oh, we can
00:08:25 make games that look super fucking real. Maybe we should do that. Do you remember Lord of the Rings
00:08:30 that came out on PS2? They're fucking dumb little gimmick where they're like, we're going to have
00:08:34 FMVs in the movie, and then they're going to, well, I can't put enough quotations around this,
00:08:38 so I'm going to try, seamlessly transfer to gameplay. And at the time, everyone was like,
00:08:44 whoa, it looks so good. But you look at it now, it looks like ass, like it's a joke. It's like,
00:08:49 are you serious? It looks like someone like with Down's Syndrome made these models. Because like,
00:08:52 it's impossible to make realistic models on the PS2. Whereas a game that came out in like,
00:08:56 the exact same time, I think the same year, the Legend of Zelda, the fucking Wind Waker,
00:09:02 Twilight Princess, Wind Waker, right? That had art direction. So like, that game is just as old,
00:09:08 but it looks gorgeous today. Gorgeous when it came out. You're so right about that.
00:09:13 Not only does it not, does photorealism not age well, because the technology is not there to
00:09:17 achieve true photorealism. So as we like, get closer and closer, like the old stuff will just
00:09:21 look worse and worse. Like, not only that, but like, photorealism is just a poor, it's just a poor,
00:09:26 like, artistic inspiration to work from. It's just a bad thing to work towards. Because
00:09:31 that everyone, like, everyone's trying to make it look realistic. They're all trying to make it
00:09:35 look the same. Like, what makes the game look good is not the graphical fidelity, but yeah,
00:09:40 like you said, the art direction. Like, good art direction is what makes the game look good and
00:09:45 look cool. Something modern now, like Bloodborne, like, it looks good. Like, it looks aesthetically
00:09:49 pleasing, despite the photorealism it shoots for, not because of it. Like, it's the art direction
00:09:54 that carries the game like that. And all the good games that are out right now, like, like,
00:09:58 it's, you're going to be fighting against the realism as it goes on. Because like, when the PS5
00:10:02 comes out, the art direction of Bloodborne still holds up. But man, those visuals, like, that cloth
00:10:06 simulation, we still couldn't re-do real-time cloth sim. It looks really fucking stupid now.
00:10:11 So it's just like, you're always going to have something like that. And it's really dumb.
00:10:14 I didn't mean to shit on Bloodborne, incidentally. Like, I wasn't trying to say it in any way,
00:10:17 like, it's too obsessed with photorealism. Actually, I think that's one of the brilliant
00:10:20 things about Bloodborne. It's sort of like, it is going for a little bit of photorealism in that
00:10:25 just, like, the things are obviously human-shaped and they, you know, act sort of the way humans do,
00:10:28 like, your playable characters and stuff. But like, the, the, what makes that game great is, like,
00:10:33 the, the cool environments around and stuff. And like, so I'm just saying, like, the art design
00:10:39 of Bloodborne is actually great. Right. Because it does all the stuff in addition to just having
00:10:43 sort of a baseline level of realism. But like, your call of duty and your battlefields, they're
00:10:48 never going to look, they weren't inspired to begin with. Like, the reason they were impressive is,
00:10:51 like, whoa, this is pushing the hardware. But as the hardware ages, like, you play Battlefield,
00:10:56 like, remember when Battlefield 3 came out, everyone was like, holy fucking shit. Like,
00:10:59 you play Battlefield 3 now, it looks embarrassing. I remember a string of first-person shooters
00:11:04 coming out that people were very impressed with for reasons I don't understand. Yes, I do remember
00:11:08 that. It was, it was, it was dumb. It was stupid. And it's, I also feel like there's definitely a
00:11:14 business side to this because, like, by, by making photorealism, like, the thing, like, because we
00:11:19 know, like, for some reason, everyone in America who isn't like a fucking nerd is just like,
00:11:23 cartoons and stylizing things are gay, I have to have it look real. So that's what opened up
00:11:27 gaming to a wider demographic and caused this massive commercialism in the first place.
00:11:32 But on top of that, you're also basically low barrier to entry, no taste required.
00:11:38 Exactly. Perfect. Perfect. And then on top of that, you've also set up this cycle that will
00:11:43 never break of like, we need to make games more real. So every couple years, you're going to buy a
00:11:48 new console to get better visuals where like, honestly, if you just cared about art style,
00:11:53 like, look at Wind Waker, you could still make beautiful games using PS2 quality hardware because
00:11:58 like, there are indie devs right now who make games that are gorgeous, but are super low end. So
00:12:03 one person can make it. And of course, all, all like the, the equipment manufacturers, all like
00:12:07 the CPU guys, like, they love this because this is excuses to like, force people to buy the new
00:12:12 shit that comes out that cranks out that little bit more. I think the most disgusting thing now
00:12:16 is that we have the Xbox one X and the PS because like, they're not even new consoles, they're just
00:12:20 like, we're just now they could run at the frame rate that PC's been running for the last 10 years.
00:12:26 It's so fucking dumb. And people just eat it up. Like I was really hoping that the Xbox one X and
00:12:31 the PS4 pro would flop and make me be like, Oh, I guess people aren't that retarded, but they're
00:12:35 selling great. So it's just, I know what this is, Tom. This is, this is what exactly Ben was saying.
00:12:40 This is the normie influx into the normies. These are people. They ruin everything. This is people
00:12:46 not looking for the best artistic or, or game experience. Like all of us are fucking veterans.
00:12:52 We know what makes a good game because we've been there for decades. We've been experiencing this.
00:12:55 We know what makes a game good. These people don't know shit. So they latch onto the most
00:12:59 obvious thing they can find that to them, quote, unquote, makes a game good. And it's how pretty
00:13:04 it is how, how life, and it's not even that like they understand what a good art style looks like.
00:13:08 It's that it looks the most true to life. Therefore, it's the best. Oh, it's infuriating.
00:13:11 These people don't know shit. Normies, get the fuck out. Not only. I say better myself.
00:13:18 Not only do you realize the graphics just look bad. They are just not pleasant to look at because
00:13:23 they always look ugly regardless of anything ever. It also just harms the game. Okay. The only thing,
00:13:29 the only thing I care about in games is, is, is if the aesthetic matches the gameplay and vice
00:13:34 versa. That's the only thing I care about. I don't even care about the game is good. I was red
00:13:39 build on this. I became like this after like, like listening to the developer commentaries and
00:13:43 like TF two, like, like, if you go to TF two, you can like, go like watch like some commentaries
00:13:47 like in game. And they talked about how in TF two was really going to be this fucking like,
00:13:52 like, you know, super realistic, hyper, you know, hyper realistic blood splatter all of your screen,
00:13:59 you know, tails doll behind you, don't look out for Ben drown, you know, like that.
00:14:04 Okay. But, but then like, they're like, this makes no sense, because if we're going to make a good
00:14:09 game, you know, the, the no real people are going to build bases like 20 feet from another, from
00:14:15 another. So this is going to make no sense. Like, like, if we do this in like, you know, with realistic
00:14:20 graphics, you're going to look fucking retarded. And if we want to make it look good, then we're
00:14:23 going to have to like, make the game shit and boring. So they're like, and there are a ton of
00:14:28 like areas where like, you know, a map can't be huge, it has to be, you know, a map that's designed
00:14:33 well. So there'll be plenty of streets and stuff and corridors you couldn't technically go through,
00:14:38 though it looks like you could in a realistic saying, you know, if there's like a fence that's
00:14:42 like maybe one foot high, and they don't want to, you know, completely just wall off, then people
00:14:46 would be like, why can't why can't we get over this. So they're like, well, why don't we just
00:14:50 fucking just make them all cartoon characters, and not just cartoon characters, cartoon characters
00:14:57 that benefit the gameplay. These the game, the T2 gameplay is all about just fucking being an insane
00:15:02 lunatic and fucking killing people and like, and like wartime bullshit and you know, all that kind
00:15:07 of stuff. So they took inspiration from like wartime posters of the fucking like 1940s and
00:15:12 shit. So they got all that, they got insect that matched the gameplay and complimented
00:15:16 and they got to fix the gameplay too. It was a beautiful marriage. Yeah. And that's the aesthetic
00:15:23 The aesthetic totally works in the sense of like gameplay because like the whole idea about
00:15:26 like the spy just like wearing a mask of the thing that he's disguised as, like that's great and
00:15:31 that works from a gameplay perspective and an aesthetic art style sense. It's a perfect blend.
00:15:35 That's I mean, that's that's just what makes that's what makes a good work of art of any
00:15:39 medium is just that all the elements, all the elements compliment each other and become a
00:15:43 beautiful marriage. Yep, that gets on Koensterk, my dog.
00:15:47 And games are no exception. Is Nintendo the only company that hasn't like been
00:15:55 cucked and tries to go for realism all the time? Hmm, it seems that way. One of the few.
00:16:00 They're definitely the biggest one who's like fought off the temptation. I think most of it
00:16:05 was even just because like out of necessity, because like they gave up trying to like do
00:16:09 the highest spec hardware a while ago. So they have to rely on art style to actually
00:16:13 have the lowest they have the lowest right? Yeah, they focus more on making the games all HD
00:16:20 rather than like making fun games. I was just about to say that while they didn't make realistic
00:16:25 games, they still like if you look at the cutscenes for Smash 4, they look like oh Mario's
00:16:30 individual hairs are fucking rendered. I don't I don't care. I don't care. I mean,
00:16:35 you know, Nintendo had Nintendo had lower hardware, you know, power or whatever with its
00:16:40 consoles. But they also they also had that guiding that guiding Shigeru Miyamoto and oh god,
00:16:46 who's the earthbound guy? Who's the earthbound guy who just died? They had they had those guys
00:16:52 like the tone like the tone at the top of that company was like games should be fun, right? Yeah,
00:16:56 so I feel I feel like that probably went away towards keeping them out of this this fucking
00:17:01 ghetto that we're all in of photo realism. My favorite thing about Miyamoto is how he ruined
00:17:06 Paper Mario. I really love that guy. It's disgusting. I think the good thing about Nintendo is that
00:17:12 they recognize their limitations and then that's what makes you creative is to have those limitations
00:17:17 whereas like, you know, Sony and these other people are like, oh, let's let's see how far and
00:17:21 wide and crazy we can make the graphics without yeah, what can we do with them? We'll switch to
00:17:26 discs so we can have the biggest maps and the most and the most the most individual hairs rendered
00:17:31 in the most veins rendered in the bulging eyeballs of our space marines. You know now that now that
00:17:36 Tom said that I really can't help but think that like really the thing that makes the most sense
00:17:39 to me is that guys like Sony and Microsoft like obviously they're wrapped up deep in like the
00:17:44 hardware game so it's totally to their benefit to do things that like like to push technology
00:17:50 forth so that they can sell more of that shit and like it makes sense to them to iterate in
00:17:54 a small increments as possible to force people to buy it so yeah man like this just to me now
00:18:00 that I'm thinking about it this really just seemed like I'm not criminal but just manipulation
00:18:04 wait wait what did Miyamoto do to Paper Mario? Oh, let me tell you. I mean I know that the thing
00:18:12 with Square and Mario fell through and Mario RPG 2 became Paper Mario I don't know anything else
00:18:18 but that was good though that was still in the good days yeah so Paper Mario 1 and 2 are basically
00:18:23 masterpieces they're the best games ever made probably and they are better than any other
00:18:29 game ever made um and then Paper Mario 3 comes out it's like a weird like science one thing but
00:18:38 that's fine that wasn't that wasn't I like yeah I was just about to say I like it as well it was
00:18:43 different but you know what it was it's still a fun game then uh everyone was but but everyone at
00:18:47 the time was like I remember that I remember people saying that yeah that was me me too yeah um
00:18:59 you know I mean yeah I was like yeah I would like that as well and then Nintendo was like well um
00:19:03 okay sure um and then they were making like like like like some like early press releases they were
00:19:08 like yeah we're gonna make a stand at Paper Mario game it's gonna be sick and then or the 3DS as well
00:19:13 yes yeah which we'll get into how handheld consoles are objectively better than home consoles I think
00:19:18 yes we will uh and uh but yeah I don't know if it was Miyamoto himself but something someone said
00:19:23 it was like yeah this is basically just gonna be the thousand-year door again but uh you know
00:19:27 different and on the 3DS and uh so I was like okay and then it comes out and uh it's basically
00:19:33 unplayable it's nothing like the other games it's a game called Mario sticker star and it is an I
00:19:39 played that game my parents bought me that game and I fucking hate it it's terrible I played it for five
00:19:45 minutes you you are you are literally incentivized to never fight a single enemy or else you are at
00:19:52 an immediate diss okay like it sounds like an undertale to me
00:19:58 except that's yeah uh Mario sticker star is truly the greatest undertale of our generation
00:20:04 have you played any Mario RPGs whatsoever yeah I played um I played Mario
00:20:09 like an OG yeah I played the OG the OG one is like one of my favorite games of all time
00:20:13 yeah okay uh I'm assuming that that was just like uh like later Mario and Luigi's I actually I
00:20:18 haven't played it because no it's it's like extremely old school JRPG oh okay well uh okay well uh
00:20:25 it that's actually the first game I ever played in my whole life I think I was like two or three
00:20:28 and my grandma gave me the controller and I was like what the fuck is this shit your grandma was
00:20:32 playing Mario RPG oh my grandma's the one who got me into video games my parents oh holy shit
00:20:38 my when when my when our parents saw me playing Mario RPG my mom was really confused by the like
00:20:44 turn-based battle system because like maria would swing his hammer and it wouldn't actually hit the
00:20:48 enemy just damage would appear and she and she'd be like it's not even hitting him and I'd be like
00:20:53 mom you don't understand your mom would love call a duty five oh yeah visceral military action
00:21:01 then that's perfect then that's perfect okay you swing your hammer imagine if your hammer
00:21:06 had ammo and once you were out of ammo for that hammer you could not use it ever until you got
00:21:13 more ammo that's what every single attack in sicker star was like so dude I can't tell you all
00:21:19 the bosses that I encountered in sticker star that I literally ran out of attack things that you
00:21:24 could use to damage the enemy yeah you just have to lose and like go figure it out some other way
00:21:29 you piece of well yeah it's a resource management sim it's deep and strategic oh yeah all right all
00:21:34 why would you ever get into a bad like if you you can't ignore it's an RPG okay it's not an RPG
00:21:40 but it was supposed to be it's an RP well I mean it's a paper maria it was called paper Mario RPG
00:21:46 it's a really piss game okay everybody should yeah exactly everybody should go watch a hyper bit
00:21:51 heroes video that he made recently about it's got all the details on this not only that but again
00:21:56 where it's slightly aesthetics impact the gameplay in paper mario one and two all this is the argument
00:22:01 everyone always brings up and this happens in a lot of other ways just in this but this is the you
00:22:04 know the classic example the the toads the toads and mario mario one and two were all distinct
00:22:11 yeah like they did so much with the toe care design that I didn't like that is like way more than it's
00:22:15 ever been used ever they gave them all the end of the world they built they built new worlds yeah in
00:22:20 paper mario one and two like like rich like final fantasy style worlds where you can go an adventure
00:22:26 with towns and shit and it was great all that's personality and richness and they just stripped
00:22:30 they thought nope this is terrible this is a waste of our fucking time no one wants this
00:22:35 shit literally everyone wants it so so they just made they just made all the toes the exact same
00:22:41 you know red spots and then just the standard outfit just all of them maybe one of them has
00:22:45 like sunglasses who gives a fuck and all the worlds are just you know new super mario bros we
00:22:50 they're all just fucking you know grass desert whatever the fuck we're in fucking paper mario
00:22:56 two you go to like fucking like like a cortez pirate ship or like rachel mania in the sky
00:23:01 it's fucking sick fucking the fucking glitz pitch the fucking glitz pit the greatest level of any
00:23:06 video game of all time okay you know what let's not spend too much more time on this we understand
00:23:10 where you literally give birth in the middle of having a wrestling match yeah I remember I don't
00:23:14 remember that okay they also in a similar way they fucked up the uh the mario and luigi series
00:23:21 mario and luigi superstar is a masterpiece one of my favorite games of all time uh and then I think
00:23:26 the series has declined since then but like the new one is just I don't know who cares the point is
00:23:31 it doesn't matter like they're they're fucking it up it's just getting worse and worse uh paper mario
00:23:34 one through three is great i'll stand by that all right i'm the third one the one that was on we uh
00:23:40 yeah yeah i actually meant to say the one with like the fez like change your change your camera angle
00:23:47 3d yeah yeah that was really cool yeah it was that statement i just said is true but my brain was
00:23:53 lying to my mouth what i actually meant to say is that mario and luigi one through three is great
00:23:57 and uh fuck oh really yeah i think one is one is a masterpiece greatest game of all time two is
00:24:03 good and then the rest are like i don't care anymore okay we're those let's move on let's move on
00:24:07 enough about mario luigi we're just we're we're superstars on the gba superstars on the gba uh
00:24:13 i think two and three i think i think i guess that's why i only played the first one because i
00:24:20 didn't get whatever the other one you got the best experience you got the best experience
00:24:23 so i didn't play the other ones either and i'm glad that my memory of the franchise has not been
00:24:28 soured uh fuck you as a story time real quick nate um uh do you remember at red con 2 when me and
00:24:36 dad were me and vue just stayed up like all night talking about mario and luigi games like right
00:24:42 next in earshave while you were trying to sleep like three hours in you were like guys
00:24:48 i'm trying to sleep can we please continue this tomorrow i do remember that i remember it very
00:24:53 well i think i was more than the patient with you guys this is muncie's best memory and nate's
00:25:01 worst okay all right we've been faffing around a lot let's get to the heart of our discussion
00:25:09 here all right it's time to talk about the best consoles yeah old consoles are better but which
00:25:14 one is the best that's the best which one's the best i can tell you the story of how the gba
00:25:18 broke my heart okay go for it i was seven years old the gba just came out and i wanted it and my
00:25:25 my dumbass dad said well if you wanted why don't you just buy it yourself excellent good point what
00:25:32 kind of lesson is that to teach a seven-year-old like am i supposed to go get a job am i supposed
00:25:35 to learn about like individual responsibility what are you saving what fucking money i'm seven
00:25:41 allowance i don't i don't get allowance there i don't know about you guys i thought allowance was
00:25:45 a myth that was on tv me too me too me too yeah yeah it's bullshit but i eventually get one
00:25:52 because my mom is not a prick and she gets me and i got i got the oh gameboy color game pokemon
00:25:59 crystal the the big ol see-through cartridge you can you can see the battery it's beautiful
00:26:03 beautiful game card games so fucking good and i'm seven and i don't know how anything works
00:26:08 my first pokemon game so i in the game with a like a level 90 for alligator i beat red
00:26:14 i remember specifically the four attacks of my for alligator were and i shit you not i don't
00:26:19 know how this happened cut slash scratch and hydro pump but those were the four
00:26:26 attacks that's a the top tier threat in the oh you made a game
00:26:32 whatever there was the girl were you the girl in the crystal yeah um of course just wondered
00:26:37 probably i don't remember but probably okay anyway here's the heartbreak we go on a trip a family
00:26:42 trip down to uh arizona and we take a plane ride and i'm playing my gameboy on the plane and i think
00:26:51 oh man there's on the seat in front of me there's this little pouch that you can put stuff in
00:26:55 i want to put my gameboy no i know where this is going and then we finally get to our destination
00:27:00 we're in the hotel and i'm like i'm gonna play some more put oh oh oh oh goodbye for alligator
00:27:10 i have i love gameboy yeah yeah i would buy forever gator
00:27:16 i have i have i have my story that i may have told before when i was running to catch a train
00:27:20 i think i was coming home from college that was in the money episode that inspired this
00:27:24 this very out there you go oh yeah tragic story ben i'll recap it real quick i was running for
00:27:29 the train and i had my ds in my pocket with nate your copy of zelda four swords i think
00:27:35 and it was the zelda the the 3d one on the ds i can't remember yeah it was but but yeah and it
00:27:40 just it just fucking i was running to the train and it just bounced right out of my bag and just
00:27:44 slid right under just fell right off the platform under the train and i'm just staring at it like
00:27:48 it's right there and i can't get it i just had to get on the train and sit on the seat and i just
00:27:52 like it's right there it's like a couple feet below me but there's no getting it now it's like
00:27:57 it's like ben's on the train to auschwitz and he's like i just what can i do i can't interfere in
00:28:02 this this is not my business i don't know about you guys what is he the conductor sure yeah i don't
00:28:08 know about you guys but ben in a train station in a hurry just feels so right to me it's not like
00:28:17 the train was leaving early like it was on time ben's just late it was it was it was it was leaving
00:28:23 imminently it was leaving in the next minute or two the lesson to take home from this is always
00:28:28 make sure that you're on time so you don't you don't run in and you're bouncing your shit and
00:28:31 every you got and you don't and you don't lose your brother's copy of zelda four swords wherever it
00:28:36 was i think it was phantom hourglass you know it was phantom hourglass that's right yeah okay fag
00:28:41 all right the ds light is the best console ever made okay here we go we're getting to Tom why do
00:28:46 you sign because the ds can play game boy game it can but it's just it's not the same it's not the
00:28:52 same yeah you know how everyone knows it has a backlight you fucking retort it's objectively
00:28:57 better munchy so does the munchy i can scientifically prove to you that gba sp is a superior
00:29:03 game boy advanced experience than the ds light do you want me to explain to you how the very the
00:29:07 very simple reason is that oh there it is there it is look don't get hard on the middle of the
00:29:13 podcast rip shape no no the reason that the sp is superior is because the the biggest problem i
00:29:19 have with the ds light because i had a gba original had a gba sp which i went through two and i tragically
00:29:24 broke one that's a good story uh then i had the original ds then i got the psp which was fucking
00:29:29 gay and then i got the ds light sort of and the one thing that i hated about the ds light that was
00:29:34 never fixed is that the d pad sucks and the reason the d pad on the on the ds light sucks he's right
00:29:41 is because it has terrible diagonals if you try and play fighting games which i played all the time
00:29:47 i played street fighter out three played street fighter two played king of fighters to howling
00:29:51 blood you can't do quarter circles on the ds light pad because the diagonals suck but the perfect d pad
00:29:59 ever made is the one on the gba sp because it's clicky and it's super tactile and responsive
00:30:04 it's the best d pad ever made on god's earth and it's perfect it's amazing i would hook it up to a
00:30:10 playstation and play real fighting games with it because it's so fucking good i i i have an objective
00:30:15 uh counter argument to that exact one these diagonals are actually perfect on the s and i
00:30:20 know why i know how because i used to play bows is inside story my favorite fetish game ever made
00:30:26 and i would only walk diagonally because i thought the sprites were cool i would only do it i would
00:30:32 only walk the diagonals diagonals on the ds light work but you have to push and hold it down if you're
00:30:36 trying to do a quick quarter circle in a fighting game they don't register i hate fighting games why
00:30:41 would i play one there you go because i'm not i'm not talking about what's better for fighting
00:30:45 games saying what's the what's the definitive gba experience and i'm saying if you play fighting
00:30:49 games it's better to get an sp than a ds light ergo the argument that it can play ds ergo that can
00:30:54 play gba games is invalid because it can't play them all effective tom just to be fair tom every
00:31:01 gameboy i've ever had the r and l button would like stop working yeah yep same same thing on the
00:31:06 ds though so that's that's that's that's just that's a nintendo problem no i let me okay let me just
00:31:13 say the ds can play five generations of pokemon tom how many generations of pokemon can you play
00:31:18 on your fucking sp fire red and leaf green the only ones that matter that's true that's all you
00:31:22 need all right let me let me make the business argument here okay here here's why the sp wins
00:31:27 in this one category it's because the sp was the first laptop i ever owned i would do all my i would
00:31:33 do all my business dealings on i have my spreadsheets and i would organize i'd flip it open on my lap
00:31:37 and i'd be typing on it uh you know on on a high powered business trip i was a fucking god of 80s
00:31:43 finance and business the sp was so i actually felt i felt like a business dude the sp was so
00:31:49 fucking cool like you had the gameboy advance original and it felt like a toy and then like
00:31:53 you graduated sp and you felt like a man because it was it was such a much more sophisticated
00:31:59 design it was sophisticated and it's not that we have to give credit to the sp i just like the
00:32:03 first handheld console with a backlight dude you know how much that saved my life yeah i know my god
00:32:10 i can't believe it took them that long to back you know jesus christ it's because and you could
00:32:14 plug it into the wall no more fucking batteries oh my god that was so important it saves my wallet
00:32:19 it saved my eyes it literally is the closest thing to god ever made by human genius okay well
00:32:25 while we should give it credit for being the first in those respective categories going back to it
00:32:29 now the backlight sucks on the sp and the yes is way better it has improved that's true i i want to
00:32:34 say that i still on the subject of feeling powerful when you're when you're having your high powered
00:32:38 laptop console i still feel intimidated by my fucking 3ds it's like i feel like it's too powerful
00:32:44 for me like like i need to like like handle it with with with velvet gloves like like like like
00:32:50 it's a delicate button of an atomic bomb and i could fuck i could fuck this up at any minute
00:32:54 like i don't deserve it i actually agree i actually agree ben and i think nintendo sort of
00:32:57 has tacitly admitted that in the way that they've made like the 2ds and they're just like yeah we
00:33:02 had the original 2ds this thing is too advanced for me to be enjoying myself with i know everyone
00:33:07 thinks it looks fucking stupid but the original 2ds is so much more comfortable to hold i believe
00:33:12 it takes a beating and keeps on taking doesn't give a fucking shit it is great and i love it
00:33:17 i mean okay so recently they came out with excel thing i want to get that that's what i was just
00:33:21 going to say so like okay now that it's been like fucking 20 years or whatever since like the original
00:33:26 ds came out they have finally or since the 3ds came out it seems like they finally like with their
00:33:30 very last iteration which no one's going to buy because everyone already owns two different versions
00:33:35 of it there's like it's you know some weird collection of letters and numbers at the end but
00:33:39 it's like the 2ds excel light or whatever it's like the biggest or whatever it's got two
00:33:44 thumbsticks in it it's got the huge screen it's got uh support for everything now that seems like
00:33:50 the defeat and it doesn't have that waste of space that was the 3d technology nobody cares about that
00:33:54 but it doesn't have what me and ben have and nobody else in the world has which is the capability
00:33:58 of plugging it into your computer yeah look at don't you go fucking high rollers over here
00:34:07 you goddamn right that is okay you know what i was gonna save this for later but i on that point
00:34:12 since you brought it up tom earlier sort of discounted the psp i do have to say though from a
00:34:18 from a sort of technical standpoint the psp has been the console that i have most i should i should
00:34:24 on the psp but honestly it like the games that came out on it were okay but the fact that you
00:34:30 could fucking put custom firmware on there and do whatever the fuck you wanted exactly was the
00:34:35 fucking tits the only thing that sucked is that sony constantly tried to like fucking cock
00:34:39 block you with that because every time you want to play the one good game it's like you're going to
00:34:42 upgrade new firmware it's going to break your fucking custom firmware what do you want to do
00:34:46 it's all right but the psp also gave me the ability to watch porn on a console for the first time
00:34:51 and i did that like a motherfucker that was my 3d is right right oh my god it was fucking nuts in
00:34:58 my fucking bed with that shit holy shit it was nuts but also just the psb turned me into elite
00:35:03 hacker man like i became a genius thanks to owning a psb it was it was from a technical
00:35:08 perspective and what it could be done with it it was super fucking cool you like for the first
00:35:12 time you bought like i got a four gig card and you just loaded games right on it and you didn't
00:35:17 have to dig around with the discs anymore you got rock hard you felt like it was incredible it was
00:35:22 it was so empowering and uh it would be i think the only point i want to make else about the psp
00:35:28 is that as like a long time sony guy you know playing like kingdom hearts and um uh you know
00:35:33 all the final fantasy games that were on sony shit like so there was a kingdom hearts game
00:35:37 i had to play it honestly there were two games that matter for the psb there's kingdom hearts
00:35:40 birth by sleep not that i even like that game but i had to play it as a kingdom hearts guy
00:35:44 and there was desidia final fantasy the most important game in my entire life that i played
00:35:50 more than anything else what's that another very important game on the psp that'd be metal gear
00:35:53 solid peacewalker peacewalker of course i love fucking peacewalker you know what was great about
00:35:58 peacewalker the bizarre fucked up control scheme on the psp and it i fucking loved it it worked it
00:36:04 did work it was even found a way to make that single analog not suck i was it was very impressive
00:36:10 you people you use the fucking like uh uh so you know you got the deep and on the left on the right
00:36:14 you've got the buttons instead of the normal scheme you use the buttons to like control the camera
00:36:19 in first person or something like that it was fucking bizarre uh but okay that's all i want to
00:36:23 say about the psb you know what i've always had a deep-seated hatred for the psp because much like
00:36:29 our friend hippo i'm a big fan of the ratchet and clink series and i bought and played every game
00:36:33 and then they announced hey guys the next one ratchet and clink size matters is a psb exclusive
00:36:40 and i said i played it fuck you well you see where you cried like a little bitch i instead bought a
00:36:46 my dad wanted me to buy all my own shit it's not my fucking job get a goddamn job let me take you
00:36:53 monkey when i was 10 in fourth grade and pokemon first came out and all of my god damn friends
00:37:01 had a game boy i was like mom please can i have a fucking game boy and she was like no i'm like
00:37:07 please she's like you can save up for one of like it's a hundred dollars and i'm 10 she's like
00:37:12 you better start saving so i go saving what a dude i large money i don't know i would find
00:37:19 quarters i had a huge fucking cup full of like money i would do for chores quarters that i found
00:37:25 around the house quarters i'd find on the street and i saved up i think 80 out of the 100 i couldn't
00:37:30 even afford the game boy color so just going to get a game boy pocket because that was $20
00:37:34 cheaper i'm like i gotta cut my losses here so i save up the 80 fucking dollars and by some fucking
00:37:40 miracle there was a coupon that i found for like i think it was walmart that like you buy a game boy
00:37:44 you got one free game it's like oh i don't have to save the 30 so it's like all right i'm going
00:37:49 and i'm getting pokemon so i went i went to the store and my dad went with me and my dad
00:37:54 didn't know anything about games so i gave him the money so he could buy it and shit he bought the
00:37:58 game boy color instead which was fucking sick so i got the free upgrade but then i made i made i made
00:38:05 critical error and i was retarded because i was i was 10 and i was stupid because i went and talked
00:38:11 to the guy who was selling the games and i said i wanted pokemon for my free game and he was like
00:38:16 pokemon's really complicated i don't think you'd enjoy that game oh and he talked he talked to me
00:38:23 out of getting pokemon and it was the biggest mistake of my life because the game i got sucked
00:38:28 and then everyone and then my friend let me borrow pokemon and it was the best thing i ever played
00:38:31 in my goddamn life and i was like mom i need pokemon and she's like save up so i had to save up
00:38:38 again to get pokemon and then i did the shitty game was uh it was it was gex gex for game all right
00:38:46 all right and it was it was pretty bad uh because it with all the all the like humor that was from
00:38:52 the playstation one gone nothing in there uh so it fucking sucked but um so i got pokemon i became
00:38:59 the best we should find out who that employee was uh i i would i would absolutely assassinate him
00:39:04 without a second thought if i knew who let's go do it who does that to a little kid say it was it
00:39:08 was it was awful so i i got pokemon red i fucking dominated i was the best kid at school uh
00:39:16 wrecked train uh i didn't i i was so committed to game boy and handheld gaming that when the
00:39:21 pokemon band happened and they banned all the shit and they they literally rounded up all our
00:39:26 gameboys and put them in the principal's office when this band happened what the fuck and i was like
00:39:30 no so i went to the principal's office sat down they wonder why people shoot up schools and had a
00:39:35 discussion with the man for like half an hour through all of recess and convinced him to let
00:39:39 everyone have their gameboys back and for three weeks before someone else fucked it up again we
00:39:43 all had our gameboys and i was a hero but the fucking hero we did it go dude the tragic end to my
00:39:49 pokemon experience was i i was i was working this entire time to get the whole pokedex because of
00:39:54 course that's what you do and this was back when i actually had friends in real life which is a
00:39:58 phenomenon that has not since come back so i could actually trade be a link cable and get the the guys
00:40:03 that weren't in the game that you had to trade for the only one i needed was machamp and it was it was
00:40:08 the weekend i was going to get it on monday for my friend michael and so because he had the he had a
00:40:12 game i had a machoke and he needed gangar so we're going to do the trade and train it back was fine
00:40:16 uh so we went to the movies i don't remember we're going to see but i was playing my gameboy leveling
00:40:21 up my level 96 uh venus or and this is before the rare candycoats so i did that fucking like
00:40:26 legit to this day i remember leveling up till 96 by killing a level two pigi because i never
00:40:31 ran because running's for bitches so yeah so i i i was just playing the game on our way to the
00:40:38 movie and someone hits me and i dropped the gameboy turns off and then i turn the game turn it back
00:40:46 on the gameboy's fine but the cartridge has been destroyed and all of my files are gone
00:40:56 dude no like someone just like they were exing the movie they hit me like they ran into me
00:41:02 and it flew out of my hands and and it and it just the cartridge didn't survive the drop
00:41:06 god they fucking animate you god damn it everything it was the at least now we know why tom's depressed
00:41:13 dude i it's it's something you don't recover from and to this day i've never gotten all 150
00:41:17 because i don't have friends anymore and i can't trade so it's it's it's it's the worst it's the
00:41:22 worst fucking thing of all time um and and and pokémon has never been the same since a little
00:41:28 a little bit of the good news tom that day the the good news is you don't need friends to complete
00:41:33 the pokedex anymore you can do it uh as a lone suicidal boy so yeah but now it's like 800 people
00:41:39 and it's like that's true i don't want to catch 800 pokemon sheep over has a gameboy color with
00:41:45 pokemon blue so if you want to come over here we will fucking trade with you and get you your 150
00:41:50 dude i would honestly make like i if i'd sat down for a week and just like all right i'm doing it
00:41:54 i'm finally making it happen and just fucking did that it'd be the greatest accomplishment of my
00:41:58 life because that's a good idea to this day it's just once you move into the cargo van and we'll
00:42:03 do it i do yeah that'll it'll just dissipate the cloud of darkness that's been over you
00:42:08 that day is that treasure it's all it's all from that one day but yeah mom dad i don't need prozac
00:42:14 anymore i got 150 i don't need 150 milligrams of prozac i have 150 pokemon it's amazing okay
00:42:28 so of course everyone pokemon is like integral to to the the childhood you know
00:42:32 super console experience so did anybody play any of the older it's anyone have any fond memories
00:42:37 of the older consoles than that like ben and i had a super nintendo i had a second say good
00:42:41 genesis was my first console and the first game i ever played in my entire life was when i was in
00:42:45 first grade and we had like a game day at school like you bring in games you play it's the end of
00:42:50 the school year and i brought in like shoots and ladders because i was young and retarded
00:42:53 and oh and my friend brought in a gameboy with super mariland two six golden coins and let me
00:42:58 try below and my life changed forever it was like the big original gameboy and i was like holy
00:43:04 fucking shit this is literally magic i need to kill you and take this home with me and ever since
00:43:10 then it took me three years to get the gameboy finally because ever since then i wanted it and
00:43:15 it just ah it was the worst but i but it finally made happen my favorite my favorite old school
00:43:20 console is magic the gathering hey oh look at that yo fuck mate me and you mate me and you had we
00:43:28 started we started young with the fucking um and the nes the nes i remember when we got the
00:43:35 i think our uncle gave it to us and yes that's right that's right and i remember that i told i
00:43:39 said it was the greatest day of my life and i think i disturbed our parents by insisting
00:43:43 that the day i got this fucking game was the greatest day of my life our parents definitely
00:43:47 had a weird cloud over their heads when like they did we actually kind of fell out of video games
00:43:52 for a while but it was when i was given a gameboy pocket for christmas like a year or two after
00:43:58 that that was when it all came tumbling i'm sure my parents just like their hearts sank because i
00:44:03 had asked my parents to like buy me a new console back then like hey everyone's playing gameboys can
00:44:07 i have one they're like no no you don't need that that's that's not for you it's not good but then
00:44:11 one of my fucking uncle i think was uncle jake gave me a uh gameboy and i man our poor our poor
00:44:18 parents uh i i think i think i don't know about i mean i think i was like fucking obsessed like
00:44:23 all i ever wanted to do was play video games which i feel like is probably why our parents
00:44:28 develop like a bad feeling because i played too much what i do is i get up i'd get up before school
00:44:32 i'd start playing sonic 2 and then i'd leave the console on all day come home and just immediately
00:44:36 pick up and eventually there's like you're too obsessed we're taking it and like well now i have
00:44:41 literally no meaning to like being alive and but then i got the gameboy later and i got an n64
00:44:47 and that was that was some good times i remember one time i was like it was late and i was playing
00:44:53 i was playing donkey kong country 2 and i was like i fucking love this game i want to i would
00:44:58 just want to keep playing it and i think mom was like ban its bedtime you gotta go to bed and i was
00:45:02 like i want to stay i want to play video games and i think dad was like he was like no mom listen
00:45:10 he's a big kid he can do what he wants like if he wants to stay up all night and play this video
00:45:14 game let him let him pull an all nighter and i don't know if he was genuine i don't know if he
00:45:18 was genuinely trying to do something nice or if he was trying or if he was playing some weird
00:45:23 psychological manipulation games but the way it was offered made me feel like like guilty for like
00:45:29 wanting it in the first place so i was just like no never mind i'll go to bed that's interesting
00:45:34 but you know what that's kind of good like parents do a lot of like babying of their parents but to
00:45:39 like force you to make a decision like it's kind of making you mature i guess i don't know it seems
00:45:43 like a good thing i guess i guess i mean if he's really like guilty if he says it like oh no it's
00:45:48 not like your parents lives matter to you at all just do whatever you want no in hind no in hindsight
00:45:53 i think he was genuinely giving me the choice yeah well yeah i think that's good i think that's
00:45:58 kind of good like if you actually stay up and then you like are having a terrible time the next day
00:46:02 and you could just make the prayer like well you know you stay up maybe he maybe he wanted it to be a
00:46:06 learning moment i hope so i want to say my first video game experience because because i hope that
00:46:13 ben i hope you apologize to dad for not learning the lesson he attempted to teach you that fateful
00:46:17 day i know i groveled yes good it involves everyone's favorite resports enthusiast rocky
00:46:24 my first video game experience of all time okay so so i walk into second grade ballers
00:46:30 fuck and ready to fuck up some bitches hell yeah as as you do and then i then and then i see like
00:46:36 this like fucking kid in the back of head like everyone's like like crowded like crowded fucking
00:46:40 around him and i like like like a walk up behind him and like he's like he has like little like

00:47:37 updated game consoles from like what we all got introduced to when we were at least well i mean
00:47:41 you know there's a there's a degree of age here but whatever go on munchie go on yeah so yeah so
00:47:46 yeah i'm i'm i'm a young boy the uh and he was like dude check this out it's the we if you like
00:47:51 move your hand the game moves i was like this is weird video games are weird i guess is how they
00:47:56 always are video games are intensive uh but then he like he like let me like like he had like two
00:48:03 game goes he was a rich fuck he brought to school like he's like normal game boy and then like like
00:48:07 behind like a case in his fucking room like he would just like occasionally bring out for his
00:48:11 like luxury his luxury you know gaming experiences he would have a game boy sp in mint condition
00:48:18 that was yellow and had Pikachu's face on it if he would only use that for playing Pokemon
00:48:23 and and he would he like let me play like maybe two minutes of Pokemon god just just the the the
00:48:28 extravagance yeah he like he like let me play um fucking like a like a little bit of Pokemon
00:48:37 the fucking decadence of that fucking game boy yes please unheard of did you know that in our
00:48:43 country in our country uh one percent of the population has 99 percent of the game so that
00:48:52 was like that was that was that was my video game popping of the cherry and that was like i must
00:48:56 have one so uh so so so i went home my mom i was like mom if you don't give me a game boy i'll
00:49:03 understand but also frowny face uh so please consider i presented with such an ultimatum she
00:49:11 had but no choice she had no options and so she got me she got me a game boy sp and these were
00:49:17 the following games i had pokemon sapphire lego star wars uh on game boy the best game ever made
00:49:24 and also uh pokemon mystery dungeon red and i i i played those games all fucking day constantly
00:49:32 with without any um you know uh respite or relaxation it was only my my my my my soul nine
00:49:39 to five was becoming a pokemon god not a pokemon master a pokemon god and so i played it all time
00:49:45 and when after school every day i would just go to a rocky house and i would beat the shit out of
00:49:49 an brawl because even though i i was a spun mashing he was shit and i was down be his
00:49:53 curvy every single day of my life and i was right down be his curvy that's undefeatable yeah
00:49:59 literally literally impossibly and yeah after i beat him every single time he would like cute
00:50:03 like like like like right before i like star katom he would just like reset the matching
00:50:07 but like that didn't know and then yeah i was just warming up bro i have fun memories of resetting
00:50:12 brawl matches uh at the moment of truth yeah i was like being fucking blasted away on my
00:50:20 did not fucking count we're doing it again yeah i i always loved in in smash like you know that
00:50:28 weird combination of buttons you have to push in order to reset the match you have to push
00:50:31 like 10 fucking buttons at once i always really like that i was fun yeah i loved it so like when
00:50:36 you like like like you always know that moment you always know that moment when you're like
00:50:40 winning the other person's game really fucking mad and then like yeah like as soon as you like
00:50:44 hit them and you know that hits about to kill and they pause even before you match actually as you
00:50:48 know oh shit they're doing it and then you hear that all those fucking like 10 thousand
00:50:54 buttons yeah no yeah fucking and then it's over no contest it's objectively true you guys are equal
00:51:01 in skill there's no delta between these people yeah oh thank you announcer thank you and then you
00:51:07 would always smile wisely and you and you would know that that that your sheer intellect has gone
00:51:12 as your hand shake with the with the tremendous effort you had to press to push all those fucking
00:51:16 buttons at once as ever your soul fucking leaves your body this year effort of restaying that
00:51:21 fucking game i'm not going to play smash anymore that's their game i'm not going to fight them
00:51:27 i'm going to fuck them i proceed to unplug everyone else's controller of course that madman
00:51:38 uh uh yeah okay guys guys we've been talking a lot of shit here is it time to get down to brass
00:51:47 tax time to get down to brass tax we've got to address at least a little bit uh stationary consoles
00:51:54 non-mobile the play station is the best console of all time is it is it just going to be the ps2
00:51:58 are we all going to agree it's the ps2 you know what from objectively the best yeah ps2 is probably
00:52:04 the best i'm you know i think i think for me i have a real soft spot for the super nintendo i think
00:52:10 my favorite childhood memories are with the super nintendo so i don't know if anything will ever
00:52:13 top that for me fucking mario rpg secretive mana the greatest the greatest times you're about the
00:52:20 remake of secretive mana that's coming they're making a 3d remake of secretive mana oh god this
00:52:24 fucking just gag me just gag me i know i know we'll see i'll report back i we should mention this
00:52:31 too briefly before we get into that whole thing what console did you guys grow up with
00:52:35 because i only had nintendo con i only had a gang cube a we and then an sp and then a ds
00:52:41 well well we me and me and nate a year ago me and nate started with the nes and we upgraded to
00:52:45 super nintendo but then but then we diverged because final fantasy was on play station so we
00:52:51 had to switch so we so we switched to be in sony boy's final fantasy path yeah we follow final
00:52:55 fantasy's trajectory through through every twist and turn that it took mm-hmm yeah although there
00:52:59 was a we at some point we didn't return to where i could get my hands on because most of the time
00:53:03 i either had to give up a birthday slot for a console or i had to pay for of course my own money
00:53:08 so uh living living birthday to birthday was how this is how this operation that's how it worked
00:53:13 you had to you had to you had to plan it strategically i have i have a great story of one of my
00:53:17 birthday when i got an xbox for the first time because i was just like me and my friends were
00:53:21 getting big into halo and halo two was just about to drop and okay so halo two came out
00:53:26 november 9th 2004 and i remember this because my birthday is november 8th so on the 8th i get
00:53:32 the money to buy an xbox so i go into game stop i'm like i need an xbox he's like getting ready
00:53:37 for halo two i'm like fuck yeah dude and the guy just looks at me he like looks he looks around the
00:53:41 there's nobody in the store except for me and him for some reason because it's a small game
00:53:44 so if he looks on the story he's like do you want to touch it i'm like what he's like and then he
00:53:50 goes he goes in right he goes to the back store brings out a huge stack of halo two copies that
00:53:56 oh and he just holds it out and i get to like hold it the day before it comes out and he's like
00:54:01 oh my god it's like dude you're gonna come back tomorrow and get it i'm like ah it was so fucking
00:54:07 cool but yeah i got that was gonna give him a hand job so you could have it early uh you know
00:54:11 he was trying to get you back there you know he he tried but but he was close but you know
00:54:17 my my my my desire to to make sweet love to my new xbox console was more powerful yeah than my
00:54:22 desire to please him sexually so you could you could have made it work you could have made it work
00:54:27 that's all yeah that's true i was young a relationship is a two-way street tom it takes work god damn
00:54:33 you have to work out of this i had a date with the master chief that night um yeah incidentally
00:54:39 my my greatest gaming uh triumph of all time was playing the greatest game of all time final
00:54:44 fancy ducidia for psb like a full like it was like christmas night or like christmas eve or
00:54:48 something i was at me and ben's house or our family home and i had just fucking created a pandora's
00:54:54 battery by sawing through my fucking battery pack for my psb i remember that hack it was nuts i had
00:55:00 all my shit laid out i was a fucking wizard i was i was running a thousand bots and fucking linux and
00:55:06 all kinds of i have no idea what you're talking about it doesn't matter the point is i was in
00:55:13 high level hacker mode uh so the the point i'm trying to get to is just that i i there was a
00:55:18 it was a release of the iso for ducidia like seven days before it went live in japan in japan
00:55:24 not even in america it took like another year for it to come out here and i was fucking playing it
00:55:28 on christmas eve a snow fell around and i was literally little finger looking out the world
00:55:32 and i'm like i just made you my fucking bitch i run this shit i controlled this world was getting
00:55:38 psp isos before they came out in america like i remember playing like the bleach game that came
00:55:42 out like two years before it even got like a chapter in america like that was some cool shit
00:55:48 oh it was great and then eventually once i got into the uh the the ds like uh what do you call
00:55:52 ace card just like yeah i have one for gba and for ds it was so fucking for gb legit yeah those
00:55:58 were fantastic again that was the best in playing like metal slug and like all these games are
00:56:03 harder to find i could never i could i always wanted to play yig drew union for gba and it was
00:56:08 like a turn based with like this super fucking sick art style but it never worked on my car and i was
00:56:12 always pissed to this day i still haven't played it i should buy it someday see that that's kind of
00:56:16 the point that i'm getting to right now so the greatest the greatest console ever made is i'm
00:56:21 going to go with the ds light just because it's my favorite ds and it is it has everything to do
00:56:26 with the fucking hacking scene so like did you play wake one on ds i i did not i don't
00:56:32 know i don't play so they remade the original quake for pc on ds with mouse aiming with like
00:56:38 the touchscreen and it had multiplayer multiplayer it was the coolest fucking wireless multiplayer
00:56:43 holy shit it was awesome the reason it was so cool is because uh we had this kid who was like two
00:56:47 years older than us that go went to our school i think his name was paul gibbler or something and
00:56:51 he was like a super hacker man so he put quake on all the pcs for like two years wake all the time
00:56:57 and no one knew how to stop it then eventually they hired someone to get rid of it and like the
00:57:01 exact same time quake came out on ds so we're like fuck you we're still playing quake anyway
00:57:06 bitch that's perfect and it was either that or mario kart ds in the middle of class and they couldn't
00:57:11 stop you because they're just wireless now so it wasn't link cables oh man it was so there were
00:57:15 there were some heroes at my school who installed civilization on like every computer they could
00:57:19 get their hands on oh my god like everyone to be playing civilization in like library class or
00:57:23 whatever the fuck it was but yeah i mean i i uh the hacking thing psp stuff got me into the scene
00:57:29 but it was the ds like the library of the ds is incredible it's so many incredible games and the
00:57:36 fact that you have access to the um to like the gba library once they expanded that capability
00:57:40 and you could run those two oh it was the fucking best did you have i have it right here i have it
00:57:45 right here and i play that shit all the time with all these my ds it's sitting right over there too
00:57:48 did you have the um right i got i got the flash card that i had it had uh the card itself and then
00:57:54 it had a gba slot too so you could play gba roms off the ds slot it just like did a pass through
00:58:00 and then it was flush to the system because you know how would like i did not have that yeah with
00:58:03 the light the games the gba game stuck out because it made it smaller but this one was flush like the
00:58:07 regularist like filler cart they put in by default but it still ran all the gba games so i had like
00:58:12 both of them going at the same time and i was a fucking god that's dope it was super fucking cool
00:58:17 but i mean the whole thing is like i'm sitting here like like preaching like the gospel of gba
00:58:22 but but like it's like there's like a fraction of a percent between gba ps2 and ds they're all
00:58:27 like like so fucking like unstoppable in their own in their own class like it's just uh it's hard
00:58:33 to pick you know gba definitely was like the one that i had like the most fond memories of because
00:58:38 it's like i don't know i think it's because like that was when i had the most money and time for
00:58:42 games so i had tons of gba games and i just like i played them constantly in class like i may play i
00:58:47 loved metroid fusion that was the first metroid ever played and i had no idea what to expect me too
00:58:51 i fucking love that game dude incredible it's so good it was because like i played nintendo games
00:58:57 i wasn't in super metroid people shit on fucking metroid fusion metroid fusion is better than super
00:59:03 metroid god damn you metroid fusion is the best metroid because like it's a crafted narrative
00:59:07 experience all right thank you nobody understands that crafted experience day i'm waiting for
00:59:13 fucking metroid dread to come out and keep that fucking storyline going i still holding
00:59:18 out yes we need it did you see did you see and uh the new metroid coming up metroid samurse returns
00:59:22 for 3ds right when you beat it with the if you beat it and you put you get the fusion suit you get
00:59:27 the fusion suit yeah it's still there i mean it's oh dread is coming i'm not i there's hope
00:59:33 there's still hope oh it's so gonna be so fucking dope you know i i just well on that subject i heard
00:59:38 that like so some guy who know like the director of that game whatever said like yeah guys just so
00:59:42 you know future metroid games being developed depends on the sales of this uh this like 2d
00:59:48 metroid i'm gonna buy like three of them man yeah fuck oh my god the first time my friend
00:59:54 showed me zero suit samus and brawl i got an uncontrollable sadness in your heart knowing
01:00:00 that sadness i thought you were gonna say an uncontrollable boner yeah i was gonna say boner
01:00:03 cuz that's how i felt uh like a sadness because i that was the first time i was ever in brawl when
01:00:08 you can like freeze frame and zoom in on shit you better believe i played a lot of just say
01:00:14 all right uh the the fucking in brawl in brawl you had that you could pause and move the camera
01:00:17 so so i'm sure we're all familiar with peaches uh yes tilt yeah her forward fucking tilt i think
01:00:23 we all know what i'm talking about and they they fucking black hold her panties and the new one
01:00:28 it's a disgrace i hate this fucking god damn it it makes me so fucking mad how could they do that
01:00:35 like okay the fact of the matter is kids uh and and parents at home like sex is real it is real
01:00:40 women are real you can't just like pretend that it's not there and like how are kids supposed to
01:00:45 fucking find out that sex is real if you just like put black holes over vaginas everywhere
01:00:50 they just have that's how actually how does blacking out a pair of panties make kids think
01:00:55 that sex isn't real where are you getting this you know where i'm getting it from okay i'm saying
01:01:00 that's the attitude that these people are approaching these kind of decisions from it's like they want
01:01:04 to just block out the whole concept of like even a vagina from the minds of children i guess male
01:01:10 children but also the penis for every one game panty peaches panty should be the main focus and
01:01:16 she should be the only thing she's fucking wearing i mean i mean they should be there all right
01:01:19 they're they're real she wears a dress god damn it let's not let's not run from the fact that
01:01:24 where you win a dress and you do a badass high kick you're showing everyone your panties that's
01:01:28 real i agree i agree but i i agree that it shouldn't have been censored but not on the grounds that
01:01:33 we need more sex in our video game is on the ground that it should not lie to people i don't think
01:01:37 a parent that's seeing panties should be inherently sexual okay but but it's it's the idea that like
01:01:42 they're replaced with this black hole like like they're they're covering it up you know like
01:01:45 they're ashamed of it and i just i'm like why why you know fucking deal like uh couldn't they just
01:01:49 added more ruffles or something could he's added more ruffles underneath there that's a more creative
01:01:54 solution that i would be more in favor of i i probably wouldn't love it but it's better and
01:01:58 like palutena like you can just see palutena's panties because like her dress doesn't really
01:02:02 allow to make like a black hole so it's okay it's okay for her but not for peach what the fuck
01:02:06 oh it's okay for a fucking uh what's his name sakurai yeah sakurai's waifu palutena gets to
01:02:11 show her panties to everybody but peach doesn't that's bullshit do you like how sakurai waifu
01:02:16 has has like a stripper taunt you like that yeah she literally has a stripper pole taunt
01:02:21 okay fucking sakurai get the fuck out you're done son you're you're all wrapped up uh oh but
01:02:26 okay nobody has mentioned i really i did want to give a strong shout out to the ps one the
01:02:31 fucking ps one that made me yeah the console i ever got for free no strings attached and it was
01:02:36 the greatest day the ps two the ps two is only objectively the best because it's riding on the
01:02:42 backs of the on the back of the ps one yeah because you can play ps one games on it all my
01:02:45 favorite games from the ps one yeah there you go there you go and uh the ps two only wins by
01:02:50 revolution of the disc the disc in the ps one was a big fucking deal you know and it should be
01:02:56 celebrated as such and the concept of the memory cards which i love memory cards are dope um and
01:03:02 come on we all know the okay let's just let's just address this right now the aesthetic it's the
01:03:06 aesthetic of popping between discs in the ps one is like the most enjoyable experience of any
01:03:13 it felt like you got way more game for your money even though it it's question yeah that's
01:03:18 even true like like when i got the first game i got for my ps one was final fantasy nine and when
01:03:22 it was four discs long i felt like a i know i know there is so much here how am i ever gonna get
01:03:29 through all of this it was the best feeling of all time to have like four discs all at once isn't
01:03:34 it great isn't it great the square edicts uh instead they make the base game and then they
01:03:38 basically sell you the other three discs as that dlc packs later i love modern video games
01:03:43 point out i commented on this on that video this morning but i was like i i the comment i just said
01:03:47 was uh i i forgot that metal gear solid two was actually metal gear solid three because remember
01:03:53 mgs one came on two discs that was great that's a brilliant point on my on my new video yeah
01:04:02 it just so you people know what the fuck we're talking about i made a video about like people
01:04:06 are actually making a claim that the final fantasy seven remake because square enix has said
01:04:10 they're splitting it into individual parts that are like individual game experiences these are
01:04:14 their words because of that it's the same as final fantasy original because it has three discs
01:04:19 like this is a real watch my video it's yes it was a period in the world um yeah so the fuck
01:04:25 yeah ps one uh i think i might honestly give it to the ps one is my favorite console i think i think
01:04:30 the ps two is like the best but it's got final fantasy seven eight and nine how can you argue with
01:04:35 that lineup it's it's it's a legend of groon chrono cross don't say the big cross was so fucking
01:04:41 good chrono cross sure yeah i love chrono cross it had it had that awesome remake of chrono trigger
01:04:48 two that's yeah you're absolutely that was in the final fantasy collection fantasy anthology
01:04:53 whatever it was anthology it had four and it had chrono trigger in it i just i just emulated
01:04:58 this very morning before this uh the the ghost in the shell ps one game which has some of the
01:05:03 best fucking animation it is the manga of ghost in the shell come to life like it literally never
01:05:08 has in any other medium it's actually super fun loved it really liked it yeah it was really fun
01:05:13 ps animation is the best game of all time with realville everybody loves thrillville it's super
01:05:20 fun uh playstation playstation only there was a if only there was a let's player that i loved who
01:05:25 was who was like doing videos about thrillville right now while he's drunk off his ass and doesn't
01:05:30 remember what happened he hasn't even watched him back in his upload someone sees what happens
01:05:35 i'm sorry bend i play playstation one had vandal hearts and vanguard bandits to
01:05:41 to two pretty terrible games that i never loved and to be free how much anguish will you have to bear
01:05:49 some head swells around the dead vengeance is soon to come oh my god one of the greatest openings
01:05:56 any video game ever love vanguard bandits just give me some vanguard bandits and some
01:06:00 lincoln park and just let me go back just let me go back to the good old days of 15 year old me
01:06:06 uh the good good times okay uh any yeah go on much what do you say i i i haven't had much to
01:06:14 say about this because the only games i ever played on the ds or sorry the ps ps2 were my cousin's
01:06:20 game so i just you know walked over to his house uh well you know every once in a while and he would
01:06:25 like uh everyone go to sleep and he was like you want to see what a real video game is and you
01:06:30 would pop in like like grand theft auto or like oh some of the most tedious games of all time i was
01:06:36 like i was so paranoid about that shit like i remember i had i had a copy of uh the original
01:06:41 grand theft auto for ps1 and it was the first m rated game i ever snuck into the house my parents
01:06:46 like i fucked that shit and i was so paranoid i actually like took the the manual out of the game
01:06:51 case i cut out a t rating from an ad from an ad and pasted it onto the front so no one could tell
01:06:58 that it was rated m and just just in case i happened to leave it out no one would be the wiser
01:07:03 nate i was thinking with your head nate i might be misremembering this but didn't our dad like
01:07:08 take uh uh grand theft auto san andreas from you let me let me tell you the tale yeah i was just
01:07:15 an adult i i want to say i was literally 18 i think at this time okay but the idea was i was
01:07:22 in his house you know you know what no i wasn't 18 i was i was like 60 this was in high school
01:07:26 sometimes okay maybe you were like maybe i think maybe you were like 16 and he said i'll give it
01:07:30 back to you when you're 18 and then just never did well to be fair i never called the question
01:07:35 when i was 18 but when i was in my 20s you know my my early 20s god i'm in 27 out oh god okay uh
01:07:42 uh uh uh what the fuck was i just i totally lost my train of thought because i want to die
01:07:47 san andreas oh right when i was 20 something like he finally gave it back he was just like
01:07:51 looking through his sock drawer and i was like hey nate i found this didn't i steal this from you
01:07:55 here you go and then why did he take it from you what what was his reasoning that he gave okay i
01:08:00 honestly think that the real reason that he did it was because i think we had had a conversation
01:08:04 about how he doesn't want those sorts of video games in his house and then like i just did it
01:08:08 without like checking with him like he just he watched it on me playing it sometime and uh i'm
01:08:13 sure all this contributed to my deep uh just like hatred of having other people around when i play
01:08:18 video games it freaks me the fuck out i have to do it in secrecy it's like it's like a secret
01:08:22 eater only i'm a secret game player no one can witness my my sin dude i feel the same way i feel
01:08:27 like vaguely embarrassed whenever anyone knows i'm playing video games it's like oh no the shame
01:08:33 you fucked us up you fucked us up dad uh oh but i did want to give my dad credits because one day
01:08:38 i brought home uh devil may cry one and i was really excited play because i thought it was really
01:08:43 cool and i was like oh no is dad gonna be okay with this but what i did was i said dad i got this
01:08:48 game devil may cry one i was hoping that you could just like you know i don't want to do the shit i
01:08:53 did with san andreus could you just you know is this cool with you he's like all right nate tell
01:08:57 you what let me play it and i'll get back to you and i was well okay and i was a little worried
01:09:01 because it's kind of a violent game anyway i came back after a little while he said date i played
01:09:06 this it's kind of fun uh it seems seems fun seems appropriate so you know whatever go for it
01:09:11 weird our dad played some devil may cry one had a little fun that game was fucking great
01:09:15 it is a great game absolutely that was my first ps2 i can i cannot imagine dad playing devil may
01:09:21 cry that is like the weirdest thing i can ever even conceive of it is a bit weird you know one time
01:09:27 ben watching don't take it fucking stabbed by by what's her face in the first cut scene yeah
01:09:32 you just like this seems appropriate yeah holy shit what the what the fuck i don't know man i
01:09:37 guess he he just thought it wasn't that i honestly think it was more of the fact that he felt like
01:09:41 like i had gone behind his back and like betrayed him in some way so he had like forbidden or something
01:09:45 so i get that but uh remember ben when dad came up to us and was like hey guys uh i so you've got
01:09:52 grand theft no it wasn't grand i see you've got a gta now fuck what's that gta grant tourism that's
01:09:56 the where i'm looking for you've got grant tourism over your playstation i like cars uh would you
01:10:00 mind if i played that sometime you know i'm not gonna like kick you off or anything and ben was
01:10:04 like no this is our game console you're not allowed to play our video games defend yourself ben
01:10:10 that is not okay i don't okay i remember that happening but i remember that me and dad were
01:10:16 like we were like in the midst of an art like there was some shit going down that made me mad
01:10:20 him about that and and yeah i remember he i sort of remember that happening if dad had just come
01:10:26 up to me in good faith and been like hey you've got a video game i'd like to play of course i would
01:10:30 have fucking let him but it wasn't that simple if we were there was there was some fucking context
01:10:35 to it that i don't remember but yeah i remember getting mad at him i remember getting no i think
01:10:39 i got mad at him because like he went and like played it like he played it without asking or
01:10:42 something i don't know like i don't think he came up and asked me i think he he just like told me
01:10:47 that he had gone and like played like my like our ps2 because we bought it like he had played on our
01:10:52 ps2 without without and i was mad about that i guess i sort of get that i don't know whatever uh i don't
01:10:58 i don't remember the typical ben hiding behind the the defense of context like a fucking coward oh
01:11:04 it's we've been saying context matters oh it's that it's mattering game way so as the result of
01:11:11 this podcast that the ds light is the best handheld and the ps2 is the best console i think so
01:11:16 super nintendo super nintendo is the best console we all agree of course did you did make wanted to
01:11:21 make sure that i mentioned he he is with me on gba being best console that's true did you would have
01:11:27 been here i think to say that he's a gba guy for life so i was listening what does hippo say
01:11:32 oh that's a good that's a good i also want to throw in that um i don't i never really got into
01:11:37 handhelds i never really enjoyed handheld gaming as much as uh the rest of y'all seem to it just
01:11:41 just felt it just felt like such an ephemeral experience in comparison like such a crack addict
01:11:46 my weird thing is that like when i got into a franchise i had to have it on me constantly so
01:11:50 if there was like a handheld version of something i played on ps2 i had to have it just so i could
01:11:55 have it on me at all times like a fucking like comfort item it was really weird and and honestly
01:11:59 you know i think that shame about people seeing me play video games might be why because playing
01:12:04 video games in public feels wrong and bad to me all right bet you got you listen to me listen to
01:12:08 me on this point this is this is the real deal all right here oh by the way gibb says that he
01:12:12 loves the ds but he thinks he's leaning towards gba himself so he's on the other ally and sounds
01:12:18 like he's leaning towards gba okay but here's the deal ben about handheld consoles every i don't
01:12:23 actually play handheld consoles like out in the world even back in the day i you know i'd play
01:12:27 pokemon stuff but that wasn't the main joy of it the main joy of it was being maximizing my
01:12:32 comfort when i play that's what it's all about so and that's why the espy changed the game because
01:12:39 i plug it in i would plug it in i would sit in my bed put a bunch of pillows behind me i could
01:12:43 lean back in 100 maximum comfort have the backlight on and just play literally forever this is this
01:12:49 is like important beyond words being able to i'm telling you the console experience cannot compare
01:12:55 to the handheld in this kind of situation or i'm just way too poor to afford like a god tier
01:13:00 chair that would that would come close to everyone's got a bed not everybody has a fancy chair you
01:13:05 know the bed experience like even when i had like a semi decent chair like like my my shoulders
01:13:10 eventually get tired sit like because they're you're on sit on like down and like crane your
01:13:14 neck down and like lean forward and shit even if you have like a good chair i've got a great chair
01:13:18 that i'm sitting in right now and i'm telling you i much prefer you can get tucked in your
01:13:22 fucking blankets in your pj's in your bed have a fucking cup of tea if you want it's the maximum
01:13:27 comfy experience it's the best experience which is why i haven't mentioned till now because i wanted
01:13:32 to bring the hammer down because there is an additional console that bridges this fucking
01:13:38 interdimensional gap between the console and the handheld it's the switch the fucking switch is
01:13:44 the greatest console ever fucking made it doesn't have enough games yet it doesn't have enough games
01:13:49 yet but in terms of comfort i've got it right here i just pick it up it charges all the time
01:13:53 i pick it up it's got this huge screen the buttons are tactile and great it's got all the yeah
01:13:58 let me know when the switch gets fucking thrillville then come calling
01:14:03 i will i listen i played i played uh zelda on it which was good then i played shovel knighted
01:14:07 which i rebought and have beaten that game basically 100 percent that game was fucking
01:14:11 great to replay on the switch i'm playing sonic mania right now it's fantastic on this thing i
01:14:16 play it in my bed comfy as fuck you can't beat it this is where this is where the future of the
01:14:22 human race is going in the direction of comfiness in bed with the fucking switch at the end of this
01:14:27 podcast nate will get a knock on his door and shigeru Miyamoto will be there draped in a black
01:14:32 kingdom hearts cloak and he will shadily hand him an envelope full of money here's my opinion on the
01:14:42 subject the only two video game consoles you should ever own is the pc the lace nintendo
01:14:53 console and then of course the dslite just okay but on that on that point can we just say fuck you
01:14:58 nintendo for like being so exclusive with their shit and protect like like what is their defense
01:15:03 for not just being like on board with the pc it's just so they can get more sales they can push
01:15:07 hardware you know yeah absolutely well i mean that's different and we've completely neglected
01:15:10 we've completely neglected to discuss the pc's viability as a gaming console which i will swear
01:15:15 by i don't need any i don't understand why at this point if anyone if anyone is is ignoring pc for
01:15:20 modern consoles i think you're retarded because a modern console is just a pc worse like there's
01:15:25 no reason not to and not to mention though the pc is basically better at old games too because you
01:15:30 can fucking emulate anything in the world so it's got literally everything you can't beat it it's
01:15:35 incredible and it just blows everything else out of the water for me the only reason to even have
01:15:40 like the handheld part is just because because i just don't feel right when i'm playing pokemon
01:15:45 on like the computer i just don't feel like i want to have that experience like having to be on a
01:15:49 time screen and having to bring it around that's the one deal right there like that's why i
01:15:52 prefer playing on my switch versus on my fucking computer because i can't fucking get comfy in my
01:15:57 bed and play my fucking computer but i can on my switch which is why all right the switch is like
01:16:02 the only device i need to smile i'm gonna bring up one of the best like the best like marriage of
01:16:07 this that you've probably never heard of because it just came out a little while ago it's called
01:16:10 is it like a steam box or whatever have you heard of the gpd win no no so it is it is a a pc
01:16:18 that is the size of a 3ds that runs like old games and shit because it just runs windows so
01:16:24 anything you can emulate on a pc that's like not like super graphically demanding if you just run
01:16:28 right on this it has like dual analog and face buttons and little keyboard built in holy christ
01:16:33 and it just you just that's whatever you want on it and it's it's fucking it's pretty legit i will
01:16:39 say that uh as i've i've i've grown up with mostly pc after you know doing the whole handheld
01:16:45 nintendo phase i should also briefly mention uh just before i get into that is that i also did
01:16:50 this like slipped my mind i also did have an xbox 360 and a ps1 however the ps1 uh my mom got me
01:16:58 by accident thinking i want to get a ps2 for my cousin had it she got me a ps1 and she got me rayman
01:17:03 and i just could not get past the literal first jump and i cried and that was also the first time
01:17:08 i discovered i don't like the way baloney tastes after thinking that i liked baloney for a long
01:17:12 time oh no experience then i was just like i don't want this anymore and then i i think i like threw
01:17:16 it away or maybe like i gave it to someone uh and i just didn't like it and also for the 360
01:17:20 the literal only game i played was the simpsons game and lego star wars you and your fucking lego
01:17:28 star wars yeah that's the sound of mini kick makes when you pick it up by the simpsons game
01:17:37 do you mean simpsons road rage no i mean the simpsons game the simpsons that's the 3d one right
01:17:42 oh um right right that's yeah could you play as like literally every character yeah well you can
01:17:47 play as all the main family and then it has like a fucking like we like met a narrative like home
01:17:51 stuck plot it's great uh incredible yeah simpsons road rage is amazing yeah well it is i also play
01:17:57 that on the ps2 anyway uh so fucking back to what i was saying about pc uh just to like like a comment
01:18:04 again on when like i want in tune to go to bcbs if splatoon allow me to play with a mouse and keyboard
01:18:10 it would literally be my favorite game of all time splatoon is so fucking great i love splatoon
01:18:17 it's the fact that splatoon lacks local multiplayer is like the saddest thing it's it's a travesty
01:18:23 it's a travesty for sure that's all to say that keyboard and mouse is probably like my favorite
01:18:28 like way to play a video game other than of course you know the handheld yes people get so
01:18:33 fucking high and mighty about game pads i fucking love keyboard and mouse i will play any game on a
01:18:38 keyboard because it's the right tool for the right job there are certain games that will play way better
01:18:42 with mouse and keyboard and there's some play better with games some games like n64 games don't
01:18:47 really work that well with the keyboard but like like almost anything else like anything that isn't
01:18:51 joystick dependent i beat hollow night just the other day uh and i basically a hundred percent of
01:18:56 it and um like i i at first i was playing on the keyboard and it was okay but then as soon as i
01:19:01 plug in my ps4 and i get my input map or shit and i get it run on there like that's just how it's
01:19:05 meant to be played you know that's i think my best accomplishment ever with the keyboard control was
01:19:10 when i was in college i didn't have a 360 and devil may cry four came out oh shit it was i
01:19:16 literally i had this shitty laptop so i played devil may cry four on my laptop at 640 by 480
01:19:24 resolution and it wouldn't stretch so i played on a little five inch square 640 by 480 on my laptop
01:19:30 screen with keyboard and beat the whole game and i felt like a god because it's so fucking hard
01:19:36 but i played with wasd and like four other buttons and beat the entire game of devil may cry four
01:19:41 and i was just like yep incredible i'm the best person who ever lived your video game has shooting
01:19:48 or aiming in it do not and put it on a console any console it has to be on a pc the other day
01:19:57 i i went to a fucking i went to a friend's house and he had fucking overwatch disgusting on his
01:20:02 fucking uh i can't imagine playing on on game and i tried to play with a game pad and it was the
01:20:08 worst experience in my entire even right now like i love halo like halo one and halo two i have such
01:20:13 good memories of that playing on an xbox but i'm playing right now spv three which is like a
01:20:17 a fan made remake of halo one on pc and it's so much better with mouse and keyboard like like
01:20:23 worlds better you just cannot do first person shooters or you know third person you cannot do
01:20:28 any of that on a game pad it just does not have the precision that you need to play those games
01:20:34 it just does not fucking work it's literally horrible i have no idea how it's lasted this long
01:20:41 you have to play a first person shooter look it's all the fucking norm they ruin everything they ruin
01:20:46 games they ruin control inputs it's before but think about before like like the end of the ps2
01:20:52 and like xbox live and shit all the shooters like we're on pc only like counter strike and fucking
01:20:57 all that shit that was where the shooter then fucking halo two came along and
01:21:01 normalized fucking online shooting and now we have this fucking huge scene where like analog is what
01:21:07 they build these games for so even when you get them on pc they have like aim assist and stuff
01:21:11 that you have to go in and disable oh yeah to take it to the to the meta point on on that like this
01:21:17 idea of like making games to like include the most people are like to make it playable for enough
01:21:23 people like like just the idea of putting a i don't know fucking call of duty on a console as opposed to
01:21:27 pc and just like casually it down like you're you're not making the tightest best possible game you
01:21:32 can make in that pace in that in that way you're just making one that like more people can buy
01:21:37 and uh don't care for it can i say i just just that call of duty is like my not even i don't even
01:21:43 like dislike call of duty playing it like it's fun like mindless kind of pop it's like watching a
01:21:47 popcorn movie but a game i enjoy it what i found really fucking disgusting is just like how like
01:21:52 how blatantly corporate that series is now that when like the ps4 came out and it started selling
01:21:57 better they immediately switched sides from xbox to ps4 is like oh there's a bigger install base
01:22:02 now so now they're gonna get the timed exclusives and it's just like gross you know you know i'm
01:22:07 with you and you know what else fucking pisses me off sports games that come out once a year
01:22:12 like who the fuck does anyone buy these fucking yeah my cousin my old roommate cub
01:22:18 yeah he buys every fucking mad game why explain that to me i i try to ask him and he says oh but
01:22:24 they updated with the new characters just fucking download it download it characters you want the new
01:22:32 because every year you have to ask for the players or whatever yeah that's such a great excuse to
01:22:37 like what does it need like how is the game any different or better it's like because you can pretend
01:22:44 that you're your favorite fucking six foot four that's the whole thing it's like people who play
01:22:48 those games are into like sports in general so like they want it to mirror what they're watching on tv
01:22:53 at the time and that's how they make ten billion dollars i don't get it and why can't that be downloadable
01:22:58 content for like a dollar why do you need a new 60 dollar game i mean because ea this is what ea
01:23:03 does they just want to milk the market as hard as i mean they bought they bought exclusive licenses
01:23:08 to all those like actual that's why like you know uh nfl 2k and i'll like sega had their 2k line that
01:23:14 was going on for a while like they bought the rights to using the nfl ea did so like sega's like
01:23:20 well i guess we can't make these games anymore and they just stopped yeah exactly they fucking
01:23:24 monopolize them shit it's fucking gross fucking um by the way i ea is probably from right here one
01:23:31 of the worst game companies but i can't be too hard on them because every single day i would open
01:23:35 up my xbox 360 which which i also sold later when i realized i was done with the simpson's game
01:23:39 but every single time i'd open it up for the simpson's game we'd go ea it's in the game
01:23:44 ea sports it's in the game i remember i remember that i'm gonna see the funny home of simpson
01:23:52 i remember that from i remember that for there was a sports game i really love it was blades of
01:23:55 steel on the nes the hockey game it was the shit yeah that was i like i like ea you you could you
01:24:02 could fucking fight you could have there you could you could get into a little a little like sparring
01:24:06 match between players and you would have to like time your button presses or some shit and like
01:24:10 fucking punch each other it was a win and that was like that was the only part of the game that
01:24:14 was actually worth playing but it was so worth it tom was blitz the one where like you break somebody's
01:24:19 bones and you can see the x-ray of it um i think they made another one later that did that i was
01:24:25 that might have been like that might have been nfl the league might have been the one that was
01:24:30 called i forget but the nfl blitz was like it was like an arcade it was made by midway it was like
01:24:34 an arcade version of football so like the downs were like 30 yards instead of 10 and like you could
01:24:39 throw like a fucking like halfway across the map and shit it was like super arcadey it was like
01:24:44 nbh it's not a map it's a fucking stage exactly it's they're both appropriate they're fine it's a
01:24:51 board it's a board guys clear that board uh tom brady i'm sorry all my gaming terms came from my
01:25:01 friend devin who played counter strike 1.6 religiously so everything's a map because i just
01:25:05 i still i've ever heard growing up sure yeah fucking do us too i all day every day hey i love
01:25:10 that okay i i want to present a nightmare scenario for you people that will leave you like you know
01:25:15 shaking up into crying at night imagine you were forced to play a video game oh god what controller
01:25:27 do you use game here's past the controller bro giant spider for ps2 ps2 dual shock i
01:25:35 my favorite is still the xbox 360 controller i like the offset dual analog i have big hands
01:25:40 so i play on ps2 with dual analog my thumb is always hit each other so uh yeah i definitely go for
01:25:45 the the classic playstation dual analog ps2 style okay i need that's what i used to play pokemon
01:25:52 like in all my nuzlocs i plug in my ps2 controller into my computer and play it on that i use my i use
01:25:57 my ps4 just because it connects easier for some reason but yeah it works just fine okay so we've
01:26:02 been talking forever and i figure we're probably have to move on to question some point but i
01:26:05 figured we could close this out with something we've been arguing about what's the best console
01:26:09 what's the worst college ship but can we all agree that the worst console is your smartphone
01:26:15 like playing games on that is is by far the worst thing of all time like there are some
01:26:20 decent games that are designed for touchscreen are you a magic harp jump is the fucking pinnacle
01:26:25 of modern gaming i was swear by it you're not you're not letting me finish my point like anyone
01:26:30 like the game loft games where it's like you have the analog sticks on the screen and cover up half
01:26:35 of it yeah oh that is literally the most retarded i've never i think they can that's acceptable
01:26:40 i've never tried to play such a game it sounds horrifying it's the worst it's the worst thing ever
01:26:45 the read the official remake of the ascensors arcade game i used to play all the time i wanted
01:26:50 desperately play the arcade game but i couldn't because i only because i was a little baby
01:26:54 i said i could only play it on my on my fucking smartphone it was the worst of my life because
01:26:59 the buttons were just on the screen and it was just like overlay yeah the overlay was just on top of
01:27:04 the graphics and i just could not see half the i tried i tried like an emulator or something on
01:27:08 my phone but that's how it worked like this it's unacceptable it's unacceptable it doesn't if i can
01:27:13 speak up in favor of it funny colors i and i emulate gameboy advance on my phone and pokemon
01:27:19 and yugioh like it's perfect for that fine it's a game gameboy color works really well too because
01:27:24 like yeah this it's a square screen so it sits at the top and the buttons are under it and right
01:27:29 that's just like yeah it's perfect so if you're playing like dragon quest three or dragon quest
01:27:32 monsters or pokemon like that's fine play well i'll also say totally i hate i have tried that too
01:27:38 and i hate like the the way that you have you know using the buttons on a touchscreen like they're
01:27:42 way less tactile and like enjoyable to use than if you had it on like you know a controller and
01:27:46 shit so it's worse in that way for sure i think that's the definition of not being tactile in fact
01:27:51 i think you're correct which is why i think it only works for like a turn-based thing like yugioh
01:27:56 or pokemon right like if i try to play mega man battle that work it would suck really fucking fun i
01:28:01 don't know if you play that game at all mom game they have specifically for phones they like they
01:28:05 stripped it down a little bit your your decks like 30 cards instead of 40 or max at 60 and there's only
01:28:11 three rows instead of five rows so like matches go really fast but it's super fun can i get marsh
01:28:16 mullen and lava golem that's all i need i have no idea because they they start they basically
01:28:21 started at like the first couple sets and they're adding it as it goes on so they're kind of like
01:28:24 ramping up the the the meta of the game as it goes i haven't played it in months so they're
01:28:28 probably like way more sets now and i probably stuck but that was really fun good way to play
01:28:33 you go on the go my favorite mobile game is grub hub it has really good game i think that's
01:28:39 it's good it has a lot of things to offer is that the thing that you just get food with
01:28:43 yeah no it's yeah i mean it's a great game i mean yeah it's it's like a virtual sim of you
01:28:48 ordering food i know i hate i hate i hate grub hub grub hub has unethical game design it has that
01:28:54 it has that skinner box that addiction it's aesthetics do not fit its gameplay
01:28:59 whatsoever the microtransactions on grub hub are just ridiculous what's your favorite map on grub hub
01:29:06 my house a dust two by by far
01:29:10 for me it's either uh it's either dust two or pizza those are my two oh wait my favorite uh
01:29:16 grub hub map is uh it's blood gulch which is what i call the path from my table to my toilet
01:29:25 hey we got some questions on patreon let's let's check them all right everybody we're switching
01:29:31 over we're going to the patreon remember people if you want to get your questions fast tracked go
01:29:36 become a patron and then you'll be in the chat and you can ask questions when we fucking ask for them
01:29:40 how many times have i just started to say the donkey kong country theme song this like this podcast
01:29:45 and then just stop after hey i didn't know that's what that was also uh yeah and the the url people
01:29:54 no patreon.com slash the procrastinators that's the one okay all right what do we got what do we got
01:29:59 what food have you eaten the most out throughout your entire life anything related to
01:30:03 carnivoreism or meat i eat meat by far the most that's a category so i guess i don't know uh
01:30:09 chicken nuggets it's just chicken nuggets i eat 20 chicken nuggets a day every day of my life
01:30:16 well is that true that that comes into it's been true ever since i moved to north carolina
01:30:21 this comes into an important definition because if you order 20 chicken nuggets but then you also
01:30:26 order one steak technically you're gonna be eating more chicken nuggets than just that sick even though
01:30:31 you get the same amount of like actual food in you so by that logic you would of course get more
01:30:36 chicken nuggets even if you just eat the normal amount of like an order of by by that logic the
01:30:41 food i've eaten the most of is nerds because every time i eat nerds i eat like 50 000 of them
01:30:45 that's true that's true they're gaming the system they're all right i guess
01:30:50 the other day i was i highly i highly recommend going to dairy queen and handing them a box of
01:30:54 nerds and saying make me a blizzard but put these in it instead do they do that one one time i got
01:31:00 them to do it for me it was sick i was curious to see if the candy i liked as a kid was still good
01:31:05 and i bought an airhead and i bought a ring pop and i had to throw them away because they were
01:31:09 just disgusting oh my god this is the most important thing i will ever ask any of you
01:31:14 this will be the last time i ever speak to any of you i'm gonna leave after this question
01:31:19 do okay do any of you live near like a mining town or any sort of like old like frontier s cowboy
01:31:25 situation do any of you definitely not yes i do okay okay well only paint you a rich tapestry of my
01:31:33 daily life on the range as they say so uh i live next to like an old mine town whatever i go there
01:31:40 there would always be like you know some like tourists looking like gift shop and in such a
01:31:44 gift shop there would be the most magical food i've ever encountered in my entire life it would be
01:31:48 in the candy section and it would be just the sack this like old time like like like cartoon
01:31:54 sack and it was like you know like like with the money like the mice have won it but it would say
01:31:58 gold like pure gold and you would buy it for like maybe like like like for like two dollars and you
01:32:04 would open it up and there would be bits and pieces of yellow gum that they were shaped like
01:32:10 gold nuggets and you would just pour that entire bag of bits into your fucking mouth
01:32:15 and chew it all like the fucking slut you are and you would drown yourself in that delicious
01:32:20 fucking i think i've actually seen these before but i've never tried them you have to live in a
01:32:23 mining town to get this candy i i think so but well that is until that is until the other day
01:32:29 when i realized they're going fucking corporate on my it's going fucking ea sports called duty on
01:32:33 me there's some consoles and and i walk into a fucking i walk into a fucking blicks art supplies
01:32:39 and i see what do i see hubba bubba bits and pizzas losing all the gold is that all the
01:32:44 minds are on a sec yeah all the minus that which made the gold good in the fucking first place
01:32:50 now there's bits and pieces of various types of bubblegum fucking disgusting i'm not gonna stand
01:32:55 up this hubba bubba i'm gonna protest you every single time you see you john hubba walks down to
01:33:00 fucking hubba bubba i'm gonna drown in the fucking i'm like melt down his gum John hubba and his man
01:33:05 servant bubba yeah how'd he get his name on the company uh you know he's just really does a good
01:33:11 job he really really he's like a trusted advisor you know no no no relation no relation just used
01:33:17 to happy coincidence why would they be related because their names rhyme yeah that's that's
01:33:23 pretty racist um so anyway fuck you hubba bubba i'll never forgive you i think we answer the question
01:33:30 injustice yeah hey i've got one here um this is i i'm reading also people where we also read
01:33:37 some questions from the uh from the twitter with hashtag ask pcp uh so here's a question for it's
01:33:42 sort of direct to you munchie but really anybody could contribute this uh at ascan2 asks uh can
01:33:47 one of you say something really fucking funny one day i went and looked at my pet and i said oh i
01:33:59 must you be barking and you're peeing and he looked at me and he gave me a wink oh
01:34:09 oh
01:34:15 no he's gonna disobey me once more
01:34:20 oh
01:34:25 that was pretty fucking funny yeah um all right i'm satisfied i'm satisfied
01:34:32 uh i can get another one uh uh okay here we go here we go at suicide sausage asks uh oh
01:34:38 this one's direct to me but anyone could comment on it um nate i'm trying to be nice but people
01:34:43 are assholes what do i do uh who's got some wisdom for this guy kill them what does he do
01:34:49 kill them that's one way to go kill any other suggestions your problem is that you are trying
01:34:54 to be nice that's why people are assholes they can smell that weakness that's true you got you
01:34:58 got to cut you got to cut them before they cut you you've got a hashtag chat it up my dude you
01:35:03 got to chat it up jazz it up you have to realize that by standing for something you inherently
01:35:08 stand against something else as well and those people come for you so you have to tell them the
01:35:11 fuck off that is true that is true um yeah i guess just uh don't be a pussy all right there you go
01:35:17 that's the advice someone asked a retired question uh okay who's the strongest person a fusion of
01:35:23 monkey hey read their name they just have credit get read their oh sorry sorry orca um in the pcp
01:35:28 patreon lounge okay if you too would like to be culvin started go pledge a dollar
01:35:35 this is important monkey who is the person that like if me and you fused together who's the strongest
01:35:39 person he could be anybody you're already the most powerful being in the universe so like i don't
01:35:45 even know why i'm involved in that that's true you just make him weaker don't you think because
01:35:49 yeah i'll just bring him down he would make him try to kill himself suicidal tendencies right and if
01:35:54 once he dies the whole world dies the the way i see it it's a lot it's a it's not like like you
01:35:59 know autocracy versus order you don't like like yin and yang and sort of like uh like like like like
01:36:04 you know honor versus love and stuff like that so if you used to gather like like all all of my
01:36:09 inhibitors that like lessen my power than you know like i i try and you know i i try and remain
01:36:14 honor bound by not having sex and you know right uh you know all i do is have sex so we'll
01:36:18 belt exactly yeah i'm picturing sort of like munchie is like the eva unit one and then if i
01:36:24 fused it with with munchie like the the armor that actually holds within the creature back
01:36:29 from destroying the whole world would come bursting forth and yeah it would be uh it would be the
01:36:33 end times for sure i think we need to come up with a list first of all i want to say any sort of
01:36:39 scientist uh immediately gone off like like immediately like snap my i don't want to talk
01:36:44 to a scientist y'all mother fuckers lying and getting me pissed i don't want to hear about that
01:36:48 we get rid of them for their sins uh nila grass tyson first one to go because oh yeah right not
01:36:53 because of any other reasons not because you know he's an asshole literally just because he's black
01:36:57 that's because he's black of course he's the only black person i can think of
01:37:03 and uh yeah that's it that that's the end of our list hey here's a question on twitter from
01:37:11 at commander incest sounds like my kind of guy he says if you were to make a frankenstein monster
01:37:16 out of the pcp members what parts would you use and why you'd have to use my iron cock that would
01:37:22 be uh you'd have to use my you'd have to use my heart my heart to give us a strong moral center
01:37:27 to remain powerful in this world yeah that's that's good so we've got the cock in the heart
01:37:31 whose brain do we use in this situation we gotta use mage's brain otherwise it's gonna be all
01:37:35 fucked or else we'll be misogynists yeah we need mage's females no matter what they have to use
01:37:39 my lungs my lungs have to be involved so that's true so they can clip the microphone with every breath
01:37:45 yeah this beam will be more powerful than anything else i've ever made it's gonna be my life it's
01:37:54 it's gotta have hippo's hair yeah hippo's gotta have my funny bones so that nobody thinks it's funny
01:38:00 that's a good idea that's a good idea uh well let's just give it tom's skeletal structure in
01:38:05 general so that we're tall and intimidating against the world you know that sounds good
01:38:13 the best thing you can think of about tom is that he's tall is well physically we can also take
01:38:22 his uh his hatch you know his brony curious hat in addition to your ironclad cock can we add on
01:38:30 digi's phymosis foreskin of course that's the only part that's the only part for digi we take
01:38:38 is his foreskin well that's what he would want us to take it's what they should have taken when he
01:38:43 was born he's been looking for an excuse to get rid of it and his flesh golem is the perfect reason
01:38:52 uh yeah incredible incredible one this this batch of patrons are not are not doing it for me yeah
01:39:02 we need we need to cycle them out and get some new one in head on over to patreon.com slash
01:39:06 the procrastinators that's a good hey okay here's a separate question at smith korban or korban
01:39:11 whatever asks uh what did you dream about last night does anyone remember their dream from last
01:39:17 night i never were fucking remember my dreams and it pisses me off which is why i want to read this
01:39:21 does anyone remember oh yeah yeah no yeah i remember it was actually about arm retrieval uh
01:39:27 my favorite podcast of all time go to armital.com well that sounds more like a nightmare than yeah
01:39:31 yeah yeah i was recording arm retrieval and then roxy along walked to my room and i was like oh that's
01:39:36 a first that's the best dreams have sex with me roxy i love you uh and and then i was like i was
01:39:42 reread i was i was rereading act six today roxy i don't you you didn't live up to what i remember i
01:39:48 don't i don't know if you're my favorite character you're out of my favorite characters anymore
01:39:52 i think you need to leave my household and i don't think you're welcome here anymore
01:39:55 and then uh and i and i shoot her away and and that was that was the end of my dream it was a nightmare
01:40:01 you're out of the pcp you don't disrespect roxy even dream for him
01:40:09 yeah dude what if that was like actually real roxy because you were in the dream bubble and you
01:40:13 bumped into actual roxy in your dream bubble oh the sex could be real for me oh it could be real
01:40:21 if it was in a dream that makes it that's how it works that's that's how it works in homestuck
01:40:25 technically i do something uh what do we got hey okay bunchy this one's for you i'm sure i don't
01:40:31 know if anyone else at leo j larkin asks if you had to pick a pre 19th century military to serve in
01:40:39 which would you choose and why uh i love this question i love when did the nazis start
01:40:46 a little bit after that unfortunately yeah a while after that um i would want to be a
01:40:50 persian slave soldier for sure because that's just the most powerful aesthetic that there is
01:40:55 somewhat similarly i i would go on i would go on g hods all the time i would be an ottoman empire
01:41:00 fucking you know that's not a bad choice i would be one of those i would be one of those christians
01:41:04 that um like like like they just like stole from one of their puppet states and they just like
01:41:09 they're like okay you're our slave now like constantine or something one of those guys
01:41:12 yeah yeah yeah and then remember you're a soldier you're not the emperor you're a soldier in the
01:41:16 military in this example yeah yeah yeah okay so so yeah i'm just uh i'm just going to oh wait did
01:41:21 it say command no no no i well i mean you could you could let's say you could put in command if you
01:41:25 want but you're still a soldier he just doesn't deserve it so yeah i would just be like a fucking
01:41:29 janissary and i just ride around in my cool ass fucking uh horse and just beat the shit out of any uh
01:41:34 unwilling people whine you know i would just force my willum upon like my whim upon uh everyone
01:41:39 who i meet no sex you can only play handheld video game consoles and uh mouse and keyboard is the
01:41:46 preferred method of game and then if they didn't if they didn't accept they would be a dead that's
01:41:53 good hey i think we've answered this question before but someone posted an image that i'm going
