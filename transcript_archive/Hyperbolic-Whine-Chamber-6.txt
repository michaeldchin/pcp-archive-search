00:00:00 Hello everybody and welcome to another episode of the Hyperbolic Wine Chamber where I train
00:00:09 my ability to complain. I am Tom Oliver and today I am recording much earlier than I usually
00:00:15 do these episodes. Usually I record these around 11.30 at night but today we are recording
00:00:20 at 11.30 in the morning. So I thought it was a perfect time to try out a new wine that
00:00:27 I picked up. Fourth star brewing company, Maple Breakfast Stout, brewed with real maple
00:00:35 syrup. One pint in a can. Maple C Series, 6.5% alcohol per volume. Another Vermont small
00:00:46 brewery. We seem to get a lot of those here in Massachusetts because we are pretty close
00:00:51 by and there's a big brewing scene over there in Vermont. So this seems like an early morning
00:01:00 beer for an early morning kind of podcast. So let's see what we got going on here. Yeah,
00:01:09 it tastes like beer. There's a little bit of a hint of maple syrup but I fucking hate
00:01:17 beer man. I don't know why I buy beer. Every time I'm just like maybe I'll enjoy this one,
00:01:21 maybe I'll enjoy this one. I don't, I don't like the taste of beer. People give Coors
00:01:28 Light and Budweiser a bunch of shit because it tastes like water but like at least water
00:01:31 tastes good. You know what I mean? It's probably blasphemy to like lots of beer enthusiasts.
00:01:39 The maple syrup, it's very very subtle. It's very subtle but it does a little bit to kind
00:01:46 of like take the edge off that like piss and barf taste that is beer. So yeah, I'll give
00:01:57 it, I'll give it that. I will give it that. It is a beer but it's one of the less offensive
00:02:05 stronger beers that I've had. What can I say? I'm a Roman vodka guy. Wait, shit. I forgot.
00:02:14 I'm gonna like insert this into the beginning. Reminder to self. Insert this before I start
00:02:18 talking. If you want to help support the Wine Fund you can go to the PayPal link in the description
00:02:27 and donate wine, money for wine. You can tell me what to talk about and what wine you would
00:02:33 like me to drink. I will do my best to find it. I have a local liquor store up the road
00:02:38 for me. They have a pretty decent selection but I am in the middle of nowhere so if not
00:02:43 I'll do, I'll get the closest to what I can because the guy there is pretty good and he
00:02:48 knows I don't know shit about wine so if I have questions he usually just takes pity
00:02:52 on me. So that's, then do that. Suggestions are cool otherwise you just get noodley videos
00:03:00 like the one I just made that you're about to listen to. Okay. So today we're gonna be
00:03:06 talking about, I don't know, I guess we're gonna be talking about making shit. Making
00:03:12 shit online and why I'm frustrated with it and just venting some of my personal frustrations
00:03:21 and thought processes behind making stuff in terms of just my personal development trying
00:03:28 to build a personal brand and also intermixing my personal brand with the PCP and the effects
00:03:35 that it has had and how I feel it's working and it's not working. So that's what we're
00:03:41 gonna dive into today. So I don't think a lot of people who are listening to this, who
00:03:50 listen to the PCP either know that I make things or give a shit and that's not an accusation,
00:03:59 it's just an observation. It's something I've always been very curious about and not just
00:04:02 me. One of the interesting things that I've always tried to observe from behind the scenes
00:04:08 about doing the PCP is like where do these people come from? What are they interested
00:04:15 in? Why are they here? And what happens when like a DigiBro fan finds the PCP? What do
00:04:25 they do from that point? Do they look into everybody else? Do they just kind of listen
00:04:29 to the podcast and that's it? Do they even stay on the podcast in general or do they
00:04:34 just listen to ones with Digi in it? And the same thing with anybody else, like if I bring
00:04:37 someone to the PCP, are they just gonna listen to episodes that I'm in? Are they gonna ignore
00:04:42 it all together or are they gonna explore the other members? You know, because there's
00:04:45 this core group of people in the PCP who listen to it that have been following all of us since
00:04:51 the horseshoe days. And I think that makes up the core audience, but we've been growing
00:04:56 substantially since the beginning. For the most part, there's been a general upward trend
00:05:02 since the start. So there has to be at some point since no one's doing horse shit anymore,
00:05:08 that there's an audience trickling in that has no idea about any of our backgrounds.
00:05:13 I would assume the bulk of them are probably coming from firstly Digi. There was a phase
00:05:17 where there was monkey and Nate's getting pretty big now too. So there's definitely
00:05:22 and since Nate's the showrunner, the frontrunner of the PCP, I'm assuming a lot of the PCB
00:05:26 audience has to be coming from him. But where do they come from? Where do they go? Where
00:05:33 do the fans go, bro? That's always something that's intrigued me. And there's really no
00:05:41 way to track it. There's no hard data on it. There's no way to really know. Because none
00:05:45 of us really make posts that say, hey, here's a new PCP episode, go check it out. So we can
00:05:50 go into the YouTube analytics and track where viewership is coming from. It just kind of
00:05:54 happens. And that's something that's always intrigued me. So I've always wondered, like,
00:06:00 what do people see? Like, how am I perceived externally? Right? That's kind of interesting.
00:06:08 Because I have, obviously, we all have limited perspective on ourselves. We're not going
00:06:12 to have some more maple stout. Hold on a second. I want to say it's grown on me, but it really
00:06:21 is. How am I perceived externally? What is my persona being projected outward? Because
00:06:27 I can observe the persona and the image of everybody else in the group, but I can't
00:06:32 observe my own, because I'm too connected to it, you know? And the reason I'm interested
00:06:38 in that other than just general curiosity, because like, the internet in general fascinates
00:06:42 me and how it grows and things of all that stuff like that. But also, I want obviously
00:06:48 like one of the benefits of doing the PCP, there's like three benefits, right? The first
00:06:52 is like I get to hang out with people that like that's that's the first one. The second
00:06:56 one is I make some money, which is also very important. And the third one is that it can
00:07:00 help bolster my personal projects, right? So that's like the three benefits to everybody,
00:07:06 like we all get to hang out because we don't get to do that much otherwise. We all make
00:07:10 a bit of coin, which is handy and brings us to our long term goal of not having to be
00:07:14 slaves to the man. And then also like we can use each other's audiences that we bring in
00:07:19 to build our own brands. My personal brand kind of sucks. And I feel like because it's
00:07:25 constantly been in this amorphous shifting thing, whereas everybody else is very much
00:07:31 kind of concretely decided what their personal brand is going to be, that my personal brand
00:07:35 and my brand recognition and even people understanding what I do and if I do anything
00:07:40 has been lost. And I don't blame anybody but myself for that because I've been in a long
00:07:45 transitional period because everybody in the PCP, the exception maybe of of of of Gibb,
00:07:54 and then obviously Mage, because Mage doesn't do much with YouTube other than posting her
00:07:58 animations and like Gibb kind of like, does you want to be the art boy who wants to be
00:08:01 the YouTube? Everybody else is very firmly in the YouTuber camp. And you know what, I even,
00:08:04 I take that back. It goes there very much in the YouTuber camp, like at this point.
00:08:10 So everybody kind of like settled on, I'm going to be the YouTuber. I'm going to do this gimmick.
00:08:15 You know, Nate had the best guy ever. Digi is Digi and pivoted to anime. You know,
00:08:21 so everybody kind of did their shit. They've been locked in their shit. And even Ben,
00:08:25 who's not really on YouTube, was locked into shit. He's doing the Vapors and Champion.
00:08:29 I have been floating around in space for ever since 2015 when I stopped doing MLP. I was like,
00:08:35 what am I going to do? I'm going to try writing. Guess not. I'm going to try drawing and comicking.
00:08:41 Guess not. I'm going to try doing this Rebel Pixels thing and try and like review art things and
00:08:46 talk about art just because I like being an artist and that whole field interests me and like
00:08:49 entrepreneurship. Maybe I'll try starting an email marketing business. I don't really think this is
00:08:55 as hype as all the people making money off of selling courses or online email marketing is
00:08:58 really selling out to me. So now I'm in 3D and I don't think anybody even really knows on the PCP
00:09:02 that I do 3D because I just looked at like some of the past PCP episodes and they're all linking to
00:09:06 my old channel that's dead and I don't even use anymore. And there are people in the comments
00:09:10 saying like, well, the only reason Tom's on the PCP is because like he knows these people.
00:09:14 And if he didn't already know them, like they wouldn't give him the time of day and they're
00:09:17 right. I don't care what anybody says. They're right. But what I want to do is I want to understand
00:09:24 what how my personal brand is being perceived and then fix it so I can more accurately explain
00:09:34 who I am, what I do and why anyone should care. And I guess maybe that's partially the point of
00:09:39 doing this episode on this topic is to be like, Hey guys, for all like 300 people who listen to this
00:09:44 that care about my personality enough, ironically, probably the 300 people who already know exactly
00:09:48 where I'm at what I'm doing. But just in case there's a little bit of a little bit of dipping in a
00:09:53 little bit of crossing over a little bit of influx, you know, whatever. I'm a 3d boy now.
00:09:58 I've been that since last year. And the beginning of the last year around February is when I started
00:10:04 really focusing solely on doing 3d. I run a blog, polystation2.com, like PlayStation 2,
00:10:12 but Polly's because Polly gods, that's the idea. And the just behind the blog and the website
00:10:18 go to polystation2.com I bought the domain is that it's trying to like capture the aesthetic
00:10:25 of like PlayStation two games, and like, mostly doing fan art stuff right now to kind of build
00:10:31 the brand and like get people interested in it. But that's what I do. Like a lot of people, I guess,
00:10:38 I don't want to say a lot of people, but like, I look through all the comments on the PCP,
00:10:41 I try and respond because I think this will probably be a topic in a future wide chamber. I
00:10:45 think we're pretty bad at interacting with audience a lot of the times. I think that's a huge
00:10:50 problem with the PCP in general, is that this kind of meme of like cometer rules is like somehow
00:10:55 amorphed and evolved into like actual disdain for the audience. So I think it's a huge mistake.
00:10:59 That'll be next week's wide chamber. I'll probably get more into that. But because of that,
00:11:06 I try and like, be someone who tries to interact with audience and stuff just because I enjoy
00:11:11 doing that. Probably more than anybody else. Maybe don't quote me on that. I never talked
00:11:14 to anybody about it. But I feel like I try and be a little bit more active and try and talk to
00:11:18 people and definitely respond to questions and stuff when people have them. Because why the
00:11:22 fuck not? I don't mind. So I forgot what my main point was. I want my personal brand to be understood.
00:11:33 And that's why I was trying to do this podcast. So maybe people who don't understand who I am
00:11:37 and why I'm still here can understand what I'm trying to do and they can decide for themselves
00:11:42 whether it's interesting or not. So that's what I'm doing. I'm doing low poly, PlayStation 2 style,
00:11:48 3D models. Right now, I'm definitely still learning this. I've only been doing it for a
00:11:52 little over a year, probably like 13 months now. No, it's, no, it's, it's beginning March,
00:11:57 just 13 months, 13 months. And that's, that's really my big thing, you know, like Ben has his
00:12:04 comics, Mage has her animation memes, and I'm doing the 3D. But the interesting thing is that,
00:12:11 like, in addition to the 3D models, I've been trying to, like, talk about 3D in an analytical
00:12:16 fashion on my YouTube channel on Tommy Oliver. So if you go to youtube.com slash C slash Tommy
00:12:22 Oliver, link to all is in the description, if I remember. I have, like, analytical videos breaking
00:12:29 down 3D as a medium, because there's a lot of people who talk shit about, like, 3D anime and
00:12:32 stuff, but they don't understand how 3D works. And they're like, Oh, 3D anime looks like garbage,
00:12:37 but they don't know why. They just say it looks wrong. But now that I like know about 3D, I can
00:12:42 explain why it looks wrong, like the technical reasons that things look different. In addition,
00:12:49 I just like exploring the medium of 3D because I'm in learning mode right now, trying to absorb a
00:12:52 bunch of information and figure out how all these things work. So I want to like, explain that to
00:12:57 people. So that's another thing that I do. But the growth has been bad, trying to do that. It
00:13:07 seems that every time I put out one of those videos, I lose subs, I lose, like, 100 to 300
00:13:11 subscribers every time I upload a video. And then if I don't upload for a week, I'll slowly gain
00:13:16 back, like, 50 or so people that upload another video, and then it plummets again. So, like,
00:13:20 it's almost like YouTube is a bad idea. I really like Instagram. I just started using Instagram.
00:13:28 And I know it's like kind of like not cool, like, because we're all like, PCP, art, faggy, kind of
00:13:34 like counter-cultury things. And like Instagram and Facebook are really gay. I don't know anything
00:13:39 about Facebook, but I really like Instagram as a concept, because it lets you separate
00:13:45 your content. Like the interesting thing is like, you know, how Digi has Digibrow. And then you
00:13:49 have Digibrow After Dark, which is like the more casual vlogging kind of content. And then Digibrow,
00:13:53 the main channel is like, this is where all like the serious analytical shit is. Instagram is set up,
00:13:58 even though it's much shorter form content, it's not a replacement for YouTube. But in terms of
00:14:01 like organization, you don't have to make another thing to like vlog about your niche in addition
00:14:06 to doing like main content, because you have Instagram, like the main Instagram, where you post
00:14:11 your photos and your videos and whatnot. And then you have Instagram Stories, which is kind of like
00:14:15 Snapchat. They expire in like a day. And you can like pin like some of the best moments to your
00:14:19 profile, but these don't show up on your main feed. They're separated. So you can do all your
00:14:23 vlog and casual stuff at Instagram Stories. So you can have one account and you can like
00:14:28 document making stuff without cluttering your main feed of content, which I just think is fucking
00:14:32 dope as shit. And I wish everyone did that. Like Patreon just rolled out like I think called Lens,
00:14:39 which is basically Snapchat built into Patreon, which I think is true. But I think Patreon should
00:14:43 be a social networking platform at all. It should be a payment service. And that's it. The whole
00:14:47 social thing makes no sense to me. I've never had anyone really network with me on Patreon. It just
00:14:52 seems like such a dumb idea. They should just focus on their strengths, which is like taking
00:14:58 people's money and giving it to me, or whatever. YouTube has a community tab thing now, which
00:15:05 kind of works in the same way. You can't upload vlogs and stuff. What you could do is you could
00:15:11 upload vlogs on listed and then post them on the community tab. So they show up in your community
00:15:15 tab for people who want to look at it, but they're not going to be in your main feed with all your
00:15:19 like actual content. So I like this idea, especially on Instagram, because like YouTube
00:15:25 community tab is great, but like it's not integrated very well, like nobody really gets
00:15:29 notifications for it. They kind of show up sporadically, whereas Instagram Stories is like
00:15:33 very much a strong understood part of Instagram now. So you could use stories like people get it,
00:15:39 whereas on YouTube, it's not so much with the community tab. It's still a new feature.
00:15:46 My whole thing is like, I want to communicate my brand effectively. And now that I like have a
00:15:51 direction and like 3d is like, this is what we're doing. This is this is the hill we're dying on.
00:15:59 I'm growing slowly, but growing on Instagram. I'm growing on Twitter. I'm growing on Tumblr,
00:16:05 not growing on YouTube. And the YouTube videos, the analytical videos are a technically still kind
00:16:12 of off brand, because I do like tutorials, which is fine. And then I do these anal analysis videos,
00:16:18 which aren't really the same thing. They're tangentially related to the topic of making 3d,
00:16:22 but they're not really the same thing. Like one's a creative thing and one's a commentary thing.
00:16:26 So they feel off brand. And every time I post them, they hurt my channel, not help it. And even
00:16:35 more damningly is that I hate doing the work because I hate video editing. So I'm like,
00:16:39 maybe I should just stop making YouTube videos for the time being and just focus on Instagram,
00:16:45 Tumblr and Twitter where I'm actually growing. I'm actually making progress and I'm actually
00:16:49 able to do work on those platforms that I actually enjoy doing because like I try and take Saturdays
00:16:55 to do video stuff because that's whenever we record PCP. So I'm like, well, I'm already going to not
00:16:59 have I'm going to have a block of time or I'm going to have to record PCP. So I might as well take
00:17:03 this entire day and just shotgun as many videos and stuff that I can, but I never get a lot of
00:17:08 stuff done because making videos sucks. It sucks so bad. Like whether it's technical problems,
00:17:13 whether it's things not working or it's just me being miserable, usually all three things just go
00:17:18 really slowly. And so it never just takes that one day, it takes two days or three days. And then
00:17:23 like half my week is dedicated to doing things that aren't helping my brand grow and make me upset.
00:17:30 Seems kind of stupid. I definitely feel like a pressure to be a YouTuber because everybody
00:17:36 I'm friends with is a YouTuber and YouTube is like the big platform and it's helping everybody
00:17:41 else like become rich, become famous, become successful and like building a really strong
00:17:45 brand and like you listen to anybody who talks about marketing and they're all like,
00:17:48 you've got to be on YouTube. There's no reason not to be on YouTube.
00:17:53 But if YouTube's not working for me, like should I still do it? I don't know. I like Instagram a
00:17:58 lot. I like Twitter a lot, a lot. Twitter is like my favorite social media platform.
00:18:03 Super fucking fun. I don't really know why I like it so much. I just do.
00:18:08 I was thinking maybe taking all these vlog ideas and video essay ideas and just making them regular
00:18:13 essays on medium like maybe I don't know. My whole thing is like personal brand dude. That's
00:18:19 what this episode is going to be. I was actually going to talk about just art, but it's turning
00:18:22 into a branding thing. Personal brand. My personal brand. I want to grow. I want to be a personality.
00:18:30 But that's the interesting thing. And I talked with Mage about this at one point
00:18:34 when we were talking about just PCP stuff in general, because we're both the artists. Ben is
00:18:40 too, but Ben's a bit better at this than me and Mage are. I feel like me and Mage definitely
00:18:43 related to this is that we don't have bombastic personas. We want our artwork to do the speaking
00:18:51 for us. Like I'd rather be behind the scenes making cool shit and the cool shit sells me
00:19:00 instead of me, you know? And like Ben has an interesting personality. So even though he's
00:19:04 doing like the champion and the vapors and they're fucking amazing, like he can he has an
00:19:09 interesting personality just naturally. So like when he talks, like you can get vibes with him
00:19:13 and like he gels off other people really well. Me and Mage less so. Like like I think Mage has
00:19:22 a good personality, but I think she has to like try to like do it. It doesn't come naturally.
00:19:27 Same with me. I have to like sit down like on a pcb episode and like try and project myself and
00:19:31 like try and be a presence and not just fade into the background because that's just my natural state
00:19:36 is like I'd rather just sit down do the work and let what I do define me and not like who I'm acting
00:19:42 like. So I try and do these podcasts to help build a personality because now I don't have any
00:19:51 I'm not competing with anybody else on wide chamber. It's just me. So I don't have like a Nate
00:19:58 Bestman salesman voice that can like hype up anything. I'm just like mumbling and rambling
00:20:04 and getting progressively more buzzed. But I just try and be as real as possible like straight up.
00:20:12 If I have something I want to talk about, even if it's weird or uncomfortable or makes me sound
00:20:15 stupid, I'm just going to let it out anyway because that's the best I know how to communicate
00:20:20 who I am and how I be. So yeah, I just want I want anybody who comes to the PCP from outside
00:20:31 even if they don't like what I do. I want to at least make it clear what it is I do so they can
00:20:36 make that decision for themselves. You know, it's becoming very obvious as I dig through comments
00:20:43 and stuff that nobody knows what I do. I'm not communicating it clearly enough. And obviously
00:20:49 just because I've been jumping back and forth but like I think we're set. We're going we're going
00:20:54 into this year on a year. This is like the longest I've actually sat down actually worked on something
00:20:58 consistently. Medium wise in the last couple years 3D seems to be the thing that's clicking for me.
00:21:02 I enjoy it. I like it. I want to keep doing it. So I want that personal brand to to to become
00:21:10 something that is clearly understood. But it's difficult because I'm not a guy commentating
00:21:16 right. So like if you listen to Nate bitch about stuff on on the PCP like you're basically getting
00:21:22 a little preview of what he does because all he does on best guy ever is bitch about shit or hype
00:21:28 shit up. So when you listen to like Digi or you listen to Gibb or you listen to Nate like you're
00:21:34 just getting a preview of what they do on their channel full time. You listen to me bitch. It has
00:21:40 nothing to do with the content that I actually give a fuck about it. It's like I'm not a part of it.
00:21:45 I'm just a guy behind the scenes pushing vertices and making textures and like saying here don't
00:21:51 look at me. Look at this. Whereas you know Digi Bro is like look at me. I am the product. Whereas
00:21:56 I'm like don't I'm not important. This is look at that. Tell me you like that. Don't tell me you
00:22:02 like me. So and I feel like a lot of the the interest in the PCP is like it's this cult of personality
00:22:10 and people are more interested in in it for the personalities and they don't care as much
00:22:16 for consuming art. They want to consume the personalities like
00:22:22 I think a lot of people are into anime because they like watching the discussion around anime almost
00:22:29 more than they like watching the anime themselves. I think it's I think that is it's not a lot of
00:22:34 people. I think there is like a very dedicated group of people who consider themselves like critics
00:22:38 or pseudo-intellectuals or whatever not to not to disparage anybody because you can like whatever
00:22:45 you want. But I'm saying there is like a group of people I think who watch anime as a prerequisite
00:22:50 to be a part of the discussion of the criticism of anime. And I don't know if that's the PCP
00:22:55 audience because I don't know what anybody does. I don't have enough time to like invest in everyone's
00:22:59 personal profiles or whatever to figure it out. It's kind of creepy if I did.
00:23:07 I uh I don't know. I make 3D models. Please pay attention to me. That's that's like the underpinning
00:23:15 cry for attention at this podcast really is. It's that I feel like I get lost in the shuffle
00:23:22 because I've been so disparate and lacking focus and now that I have it it's like too late
00:23:28 for people to understand. It's like I gotta go back to like all 90 something episodes of PCP
00:23:34 and change all the links probably like to my Instagram or my Twitter so people can see the
00:23:38 artwork I'm doing as opposed to like a YouTube channel that doesn't communicate it very effectively
00:23:42 and I don't think is my best work anyway. Oh oh god oh building things online is hard when you're
00:23:50 not an extroverted confident person. It's very hard guys let me let me tell you. Keeping up
00:23:56 keeping up with these guys who who who feel like their shit is the shit when you feel like your
00:24:01 shit is shit. Oh boy it's it's tough it's it's a tricky. There's definitely jostling in every
00:24:11 PCP episode like man I gotta be able to say my fucking piece. I gotta be able to say something
00:24:15 witty but I'm not a funny guy. I don't my jokes are very reactionary. You can tell me sit down
00:24:21 and be like Tom tell a joke. I'd be like fuck not funny. I'm not entertaining. 99% of my life
00:24:28 is like sitting behind a laptop screen clicking and that's what I do and I hope the fruits of those
00:24:34 clickings take me somewhere and give me something. Oh what was the point? I don't remember what the
00:24:42 point was. Let me drink more beer. I had so much fucking rum last night and I didn't even get bugs.
00:24:51 I was so upset. I just wanted the pain of editing to go away and it did.
00:24:57 Um this is like the worst wine chamber yet I feel. Usually when I do a wine chamber I have
00:25:03 like a one specific point I want to hammer away at and then I'm good. This one felt way more all over
00:25:07 the place because I'm talking about myself and again this kind of goes back into what I was just
00:25:10 saying. I don't have that extroverted personality so when I have to talk about myself I fall apart
00:25:17 because like I'm boring. I don't care. I don't care about me. Just just go to instagram.com
00:25:22 slash polystation 2. You'll understand more about me just by looking through those videos than
00:25:28 then you will listen to all these episodes combined. Like that's what I care about.
00:25:33 That's what I want to be known for. I changed patreon.com slash save me. It's patreon.com
00:25:38 slash polystation 2 because I'm sick of my only person. My personality on the pcp has devolved
00:25:45 into this guy has a miserable shitty life and he's a joke. I don't want to be a miserable shitty joke.
00:25:54 I I freely admit that my situation is not the best but I don't feel sorry for myself. I joke
00:26:02 about being sorry for myself but I think the joke has become my primary defining characteristic.
00:26:08 Let me fucking tell you I don't feel sorry for myself. I made mistakes. I have suffered and
00:26:17 fucked myself over because I don't have confidence in myself and I've let other people make decisions
00:26:23 for me and I fucking put myself in this position but it's my responsibility and my interest in
00:26:31 digging myself out of the shithole and becoming the best person on this podcast becoming the most
00:26:37 successful person making more money than everybody on here because despite the fact that I self
00:26:43 depreciate all the time I think the work that I do is way more interesting than when everybody else
00:26:47 on this fucking podcast does because criticism is gay and making things is by default more valuable
00:26:54 and commentating on things so despite the fact that I kind of mope around and have become this
00:26:58 caricature of myself saying oh woe is me patreon.com so I save me I'm poor and fucked up I still think
00:27:03 that my shit's more interesting and more valuable than anything anybody else does in this goddamn
00:27:07 fucking channel except for mage and ben because they're both doing art too so they're excluded from
00:27:13 that rant but that's the whole thing and munchy investigator come on munchy you promised me you
00:27:18 let me see whips like fucking a month ago and I still haven't seen him I still haven't seen him
00:27:23 okay fuck I don't know why I'm getting more like buzz off of this stout than I did on like
00:27:28 shotgunning rom yesterday maybe I'm just still really tired I don't fucking know dude
00:27:37 I don't want to be I want to have a personal brand I want to like have a good personality and I want
00:27:41 to be known for like my artwork and I'm sick of being a fucking uh sad sorry I don't want anyone
00:27:48 to be sorry for me fuck you if you're sorry for me I don't I don't want to be sorry for me I don't
00:27:54 want anyone else to be sorry for me if you donate to my patreon I want you to be like man patreon.com
00:27:58 slash save me like this guy's got a shitty life I'm gonna give him a dollar because he needs it
00:28:04 more than me no I want you to be like patreon.com slash polystation too this guy is totally zeroing
00:28:09 in on my nostalgia the fucking fos from Hoseki no Kuni designed to look like a PlayStation 2
00:28:13 character straight out of like Xeno Saga that's fucking dope like I'll give you five dollars
00:28:18 you're the coolest that's what I want that's what I want my personal brand to be I don't want to be
00:28:25 the sorry parody of myself fuck that
00:28:33 sometimes I feel shitty because Nate and Digi have more money and more patrons and more all
00:28:38 that shit and more subscribers but I would hate to have subscribers and money for the work that
00:28:44 they do why because I did when I did my little pony and I was miserable and it felt disgusting so
00:28:50 fuck that I don't I don't want to do reviews and there's also why maybe I shouldn't do these analysis
00:28:55 videos on youtube even though I feel like they're more valuable because at least I'm interested
00:29:00 in the subject matter but even if they took off like let's say why 3d anime sucks got like 10
00:29:04 million views today like while I'm recording this and I got a million subscribers all those people
00:29:09 they wouldn't care about polystation 2 they wouldn't care about the animation and the 3d graphics
00:29:15 I'm doing they just want more analysis they probably just want more analysis on anime in general
00:29:21 and I I know so no
00:29:28 I think I think this podcast is over I feel like I'm just rambling now but that
00:29:33 go check out my work that matters understand if you've been confused about my personal brand I
00:29:38 am a 3d artist I'm gonna do lots of cool 3d shit and my personal belief is that the worst piece of
00:29:47 art is more inherently valuable than the best analytical video ever made by by context of the
00:29:56 medium it's in fight me if you want if you want more description on that let me know maybe I'll
00:30:00 do a wine chamber on that opinion but no I don't feel sorry for myself don't feel sorry for me
00:30:08 okay good good bye
