00:00:00 I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.
00:00:12 Okay, that's the start of the episode. Go!
00:00:16 Hello everybody and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast, the only show where topics go to die.
00:00:25 Excellent start, excellent start.
00:00:27 Guests, keep it going, keep it going.
00:00:30 Hi, I'm a guest, holy shit, I never paint. I paint.
00:00:35 That's true.
00:00:36 Also, I have with me, right next to me, Asha A.M. Hello.
00:00:41 She also paints.
00:00:42 Never paint and Asha A.M.
00:00:43 Yes, yes, I have seen both of your art on Twitter and elsewhere.
00:00:50 You two are, I've seen your usernames around for years and years at this point.
00:00:57 We met at Dating Sim back in the day, many eons ago.
00:01:01 Right.
00:01:02 Back before things got weird.
00:01:06 You both, I'm sorry, did you say the Dating Sim was before it got weird?
00:01:12 No, shit got weird.
00:01:14 I met the world, I met like the pandemic started, I think, wait, did it?
00:01:19 Yeah, the pandemic started, S.
00:01:21 Yeah, it was pre, that was pre-pandemic.
00:01:23 Yeah, it was.
00:01:24 It released in the first week.
00:01:25 Because it was pre-radcon.
00:01:26 Yeah, it was pre-radcon four.
00:01:28 Actually, yeah.
00:01:29 Because radcon four caused the pandemic.
00:01:31 Yeah, yes, we all know.
00:01:33 As, you know, if you've read, you know, anyone who's, wait, did I, did I publish, anyone
00:01:38 who's purchased Road to Radcon has read the backstory and knows that coronavirus came from,
00:01:46 that cold corona was transformed in a horrific accident involving super aids, ISIS, and other
00:01:53 things that I can't remember at the moment.
00:01:55 I think there was a Lovecraft squid involved.
00:01:57 We guess that all along, we didn't even have to read it.
00:02:00 That was clear.
00:02:01 We knew it deep in our hearts.
00:02:05 Some twists, yeah.
00:02:08 But yeah, you, right, I forgot, you both wrote for the, well, you did art.
00:02:14 I did art hero.
00:02:15 You both did art.
00:02:16 I did art and writing.
00:02:18 You did art as well.
00:02:19 And more or less directed.
00:02:20 You became the director.
00:02:21 Well, co-director, I guess, together with Chip Weisman.
00:02:25 Yeah, to keep everything together for these grueling 18 months of production.
00:02:31 Yeah, it's funny that I've enjoyed the game and it's like, wow, this cool thing just suddenly
00:02:39 appeared.
00:02:40 I never really asked anyone involved what the process was like.
00:02:46 I've heard that it was a bit of a nightmare because, of course, it would be such a large
00:02:50 project and so many things going on.
00:02:52 Yeah.
00:02:53 But what's the story, huh?
00:02:55 I mean, this is an interview now.
00:02:57 Oh, cool.
00:02:58 I guess.
00:02:59 We did have an interview thing on the PCP channel like two years ago with Nathan.
00:03:05 Oh my God, I forgot.
00:03:06 I'm so embarrassed.
00:03:07 No, it's all right.
00:03:09 I remember, I'm sure I've forgotten some bits of it, but I remember listening to it.
00:03:14 I don't know.
00:03:16 Yeah, if you want to say anything about that.
00:03:20 Yeah, I mean, I think it just started in the game launch.
00:03:23 I guess we'll link in the description.
00:03:24 Link in the description to the dating sim for anyone that hasn't played it.
00:03:28 And also, we can link to that interview.
00:03:31 If you want to recapture the aesthetic and the feeling of the PCP from like three to
00:03:37 like six years ago, play that game.
00:03:41 It's a time capsule.
00:03:44 It will never be relevant again.
00:03:46 It was only relevant at like one specific time in history.
00:03:50 Yeah.
00:03:52 You know, okay, have I mentioned on the podcast before that I conscripted several of you,
00:03:59 the PCP dating sim guys to write the dojin.
00:04:02 Have I mentioned that?
00:04:04 I'm pretty sure you have mentioned it.
00:04:05 Have I made that?
00:04:06 You might have.
00:04:07 Okay, that's true.
00:04:08 That's true.
00:04:09 Yeah, it's you.
00:04:10 I asked you guys, since you guys did such a great job making the dating sim and it was
00:04:15 very funny, I thought there would be no one else.
00:04:19 I thought it would be a good pool to draw from for people who wanted to write some funny
00:04:25 gag strips for the dojin and it was you and Chip Wiseman and Ouroborista.
00:04:31 Yeah, yeah.
00:04:32 Right?
00:04:33 It's the name.
00:04:34 That was already a year ago, I think.
00:04:36 Almost a year ago.
00:04:37 It was already a year ago.
00:04:39 Yeah, I know.
00:04:41 But you've seen that I've been posting.
00:04:43 Yeah, they've been looking great.
00:04:45 A drinking moth has picked up the slack and has been making more pages and they look really good.
00:04:53 You know, one thing that I appreciate, especially, I'm remembering, I read the script when you
00:04:59 gave it to me, but seeing the pages that they're coming out, one thing that I really appreciate
00:05:04 is that there are jokes in the dojin that specifically reference the fact that by the
00:05:12 time the dojin was written, the PCP as it existed at the time of Radcon 4 was dead and
00:05:18 had completely changed.
00:05:22 Like reading the dojin, it's written for a post PCP.
00:05:27 It's a post PCP world, basically.
00:05:29 Yeah, it's like a combination of making fun of what's going on right now and how everything
00:05:35 has changed, but also capturing some nostalgia for the good old times.
00:05:40 Yeah.
00:05:41 Yeah, come back.
00:05:42 I don't know.
00:05:44 I wrote that little snippet of you getting tentacle molested by your tentacle crew.
00:05:52 Collapse.
00:05:53 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:05:54 There was just...
00:05:55 Rearadno.
00:05:56 There was just remembering the good old snotlock times.
00:05:59 Yeah, those were good old times.
00:06:04 I meant to do another one and I've had other things occupying me and so I have not gotten
00:06:13 around to my next snotlock, which I had plans for and they have been pushed back and pushed
00:06:21 back.
00:06:22 What would it be?
00:06:23 Would it be another Pokemon?
00:06:24 Yeah, I wanted to do Platinum and I had some story elements, I had some ideas for it.
00:06:36 I never played Platinum.
00:06:39 And you know, without spoiling anything, I will say that if those were to be relevant,
00:06:47 I would probably have to do it before 2024.
00:06:53 There's a time limit.
00:06:54 There's a deadline.
00:06:55 Are they making a remake?
00:06:57 No, that's not why.
00:07:01 Why 2024?
00:07:02 I'm not telling why.
00:07:04 You'll just have to guess.
00:07:06 There are externalities.
00:07:08 There are externalities in the real world that would make the ideas that I had for the
00:07:14 plot of my theoretical next snotlock obsolete if I did it post 2024.
00:07:22 I wonder what the fuck could be happening on such a year.
00:07:25 I don't know.
00:07:26 Could it be the Olympics?
00:07:27 No.
00:07:28 Could it be the FIFA football?
00:07:31 No.
00:07:32 Well, I just don't know then.
00:07:35 Could it be the terrorist attack that I have planned out?
00:07:39 In Minecraft.
00:07:40 In Minecraft, guys.
00:07:41 Of course not.
00:07:42 Of course not.
00:07:43 Of course not.
00:07:45 Anyway, I just wanted to give you kudos on the script and I am really looking forward
00:07:53 to it being done.
00:07:54 Do the same.
00:07:55 It is coming along again.
00:07:56 It was in production hell for a long time, but it will, it is getting there.
00:08:01 At long last.
00:08:02 It's very exciting.
00:08:03 Did he plan?
00:08:04 He got us to Drinking Month for being a, yes, yes queen, yes queen, slay, slay.
00:08:12 I'm happy that still people out there, like new people coming in, making fan art and sending
00:08:17 it through voicemails, like, I don't know, that's, this is great.
00:08:21 I'm glad that the short period where the PCP had a voice, no, it had a fan art section
00:08:29 just got returned by the voicemailers.
00:08:33 There was this in 2018, there were like a few episodes where you did like a little fan
00:08:38 art thing, where you showed fan art that people drew and then you stopped.
00:08:44 Because I don't, I don't remember that.
00:08:46 Yeah.
00:08:47 No, we did do that.
00:08:48 I think it was, I can't remember the reasoning, but it was something to do with it being like,
00:08:54 there's not that much fan art.
00:08:56 So making a whole like thing about it would be like, I don't know, some days we just wouldn't
00:09:01 have any.
00:09:02 Maybe like the fan art was exploding around the time just because you did that.
00:09:06 Were those, those must have been in the Nate days, right?
00:09:09 I mean, of course.
00:09:10 Yeah.
00:09:11 Oh, of course.
00:09:12 Yeah.
00:09:13 Nate was always so like, so rigid about like the, it like, it's structured, like if there's
00:09:18 a segment like the segment, the segment format must be adhered to, the topics must be, the
00:09:24 topics must be obeyed.
00:09:25 I think the actual problem was that you also did the theme song contest at the same time
00:09:32 and also still had to ask PCP.
00:09:35 So yet three little segments and you just got annoyed by that or something.
00:09:38 Too many segments.
00:09:40 Very annoying.
00:09:41 Very annoying.
00:09:42 Yeah.
00:09:43 And they were, yeah.
00:09:44 It's, it's just, I think it should have been definitely allocated just like the fan moment.
00:09:51 Let's look at fan stuff.
00:09:53 We got some questions.
00:09:54 We got some video, some audio.
00:09:58 Yeah.
00:09:59 Got a picture or two.
00:10:02 They validate us for our existence, for our stupid podcast that has been going for years
00:10:07 and years, which is very odd.
00:10:10 What can I say?
00:10:12 Odd, but I appreciate it.
00:10:13 What else would I draw to?
00:10:14 Like I need something.
00:10:17 I, you know, not, not to be a, well, I don't know if it would be a downer, but I guess
00:10:25 in podcast news, in terms of like blasts from the past, from the PCP history, did you, did
00:10:30 anyone see a DeVoo, DeVoo's tweet the other day?
00:10:34 I don't think so.
00:10:36 I saw you respond to it.
00:10:39 Made me mad.
00:10:40 Made me mad.
00:10:41 Something about like the being in the Christian lecture and disavowing it or their involvement
00:10:45 of DeVoo.
00:10:46 DeVoo, DeVoo.
00:10:47 Yeah.
00:10:48 Basically DeVoo disavowed her involvement in the lecture because of, because it's mean
00:10:56 or something like that, I don't know.
00:10:58 Something stupid, some dumb shit made me, it was annoying.
00:11:04 It was annoying.
00:11:05 It's, it's, it's meaningless, but it's annoying and I don't like it.
00:11:10 I never felt that bad about those lectures because like in terms of, of Christian stuff,
00:11:18 it was more lighthearted and less like spiteful and like toxic than other things I've seen
00:11:26 I really think that I was not, that I was, that I tried not to be like particularly venomous.
00:11:35 Like I pretty much used kid gloves through the whole thing as far as I'm concerned.
00:11:40 I'll also say someone posted for me a screenshot of someone in, in someone asked DeVoo on Discord
00:11:48 like, Hey, what's up with that?
00:11:50 DeVoo explained her feelings about it and she said that she had not only not recently
00:11:56 watched the video, she had never watched the video back.
00:11:59 She just remembered sitting in it and she explained what she thought the problem with
00:12:04 the lecture was and I'm not kidding.
00:12:07 Yeah.
00:12:08 She never watched it.
00:12:10 She never watched it back, but she explained what she thought the problem was and her problem
00:12:14 with it basically is that the story of Chris Chen is a story about Chris getting harassed.
00:12:20 So it's basically like, you know, you know that, that, that list that's been going around
00:12:26 Twitter, I've seen people talking about that list of problematic authors.
00:12:30 I have heard it, but I haven't seen it.
00:12:33 I haven't seen it, but I get the impression from what people say about it, that it's stuff
00:12:38 like, that it's, it's stuff like fucking catcher in the rye is on there because like Holden
00:12:45 Caulfield is like a jerk and misogynist and stuff.
00:12:49 And he like stuff like that, you know, it's like, it's like, it's like problematic because
00:12:57 they wrote about a character who is flawed and like that flaw is a problem, right?
00:13:01 That's basically DeVoo's problem is that the story of Chris Chan is sad because people
00:13:06 were mean to Chris.
00:13:07 So it's bad to be in a lecture where I talk about how that happened, do a, I mean, I,
00:13:14 I will say that a lot of the part of Chris Chan is that the harassment is, it's like a
00:13:23 disabled person who can't deal well with bullying is like very funny when the bullies bully her.
00:13:33 So it creates a cycle.
00:13:35 And like, you could argue that playing into that cycle at all is not moral, I guess.
00:13:40 Hmm.
00:13:41 Well, like, you could.
00:13:43 Yeah, I don't think if you were a pussy.
00:13:46 Yeah.
00:13:46 I mean, there's, there's an argument there.
00:13:48 I don't particularly think it's worth me disavowing my sitting in watching somebody talk
00:13:54 about it.
00:13:55 I don't feel bad.
00:13:57 I don't feel bad in the slightest.
00:14:01 That's it.
00:14:02 I think the thing I get that like people who make content about Christian can be like real
00:14:10 assholes about it and don't have the nuance of realizing this is like a kind of fucked up
00:14:16 thing the internet did.
00:14:18 But I think in comparison to yours was a bit more not, I don't, you were more focused on
00:14:27 the comics and also it's not like you weren't like the other people who just say, oh, Chris
00:14:33 is a bad person who deserves to get misgendered.
00:14:37 I think, I mean, I, you know, I did misgender Chris in that first video, and it was, and
00:14:43 it was out of, it was out of talking cast sense on my own part.
00:14:48 Yeah.
00:14:48 Well, it's because I didn't, I didn't really understand because I hadn't really like read
00:14:54 up on like recent Chris.
00:14:56 I mostly knew Chris from when I had read about her like in the old days.
00:15:01 And I was, I was mostly just going on what I remembered.
00:15:04 And when I read the quickie to, you know, find out, you know, new developments, you
00:15:11 know, the quickie always says he, and so I just, I just kind of did that because I sort
00:15:16 of didn't didn't really look into it and then the content is from people who don't have
00:15:23 enough empathy to some degree.
00:15:27 No, the quickie, the quickie is written by bad, the quickie is written by bad people.
00:15:32 Who like went out their way to get all this information are really bad people, but it's
00:15:37 really interesting to learn about Christian.
00:15:40 Like I fell down a hole, I think like last year.
00:15:43 It's, it's, it was my bad.
00:15:46 It was my bad to take their word about that was my, that was my error.
00:15:52 But so, you know, but that was a mistake.
00:15:56 But shit, where was I going with that?
00:15:59 Um, yeah, I, uh, I, I think I like, I feel, I think that I feel, I felt a lot of empathy
00:16:09 with Chris.
00:16:09 I mostly saw Chris as a sort of harmless kook who is not really hurting anyone.
00:16:14 And I think I made that point clear many times in that lecture that like, Chris doesn't
00:16:18 really deserve to be harassed.
00:16:20 Bad things happen to her.
00:16:22 She was harassed.
00:16:23 It's not good that those things happened.
00:16:25 But here are some funny things that she said.
00:16:28 Uh, here are some, uh, here are some, here are some, here's some facts about her life as
00:16:34 related to the comic was hurt in the making of this story about Christian, but would you
00:16:39 like to hear the story?
00:16:40 Right.
00:16:41 It's really good.
00:16:42 It's a funny story.
00:16:43 I will not, I will not, I will restrain myself from, uh, exploding.
00:16:54 I will restrain myself from giving a full explanation of what I think about DeVoo as
00:17:00 a human being.
00:17:01 Uh, I will, I will, I will simply not simply see those teeth.
00:17:08 Yes.
00:17:09 Oh yeah.
00:17:09 Oh, they're grinding.
00:17:10 All right.
00:17:12 You don't have to burn everything down all the time.
00:17:14 Just reserve it on Sunday.
00:17:17 Oh, wait, it's Sunday.
00:17:18 No, wait, no, it is Sunday.
00:17:21 Sorry, sorry, sorry, loser.
00:17:24 I mean, there's like, you know, there's like, you could wish that you changed, like, didn't
00:17:29 say things in a certain way, but you don't have to like, throw out the whole, uh, pot.
00:17:36 Right.
00:17:37 I, I don't understand.
00:17:38 You know, DeVoo messaged me a while ago and basically said the same thing.
00:17:44 Like, Hey, Ben, uh, I'm thinking of posting on the internet again.
00:17:48 And I just want you to know that I kind of don't like that I was in that lecture and
00:17:52 I got mad and I said, why are you telling me this?
00:17:55 Like, I don't care.
00:17:55 She, she, she worries so much about it and nobody would care.
00:17:59 Like, she's so worried about it.
00:18:01 And you know, it's really, I got to say, it's really self absorbed of her to even
00:18:04 think anyone gives a shit that she was in the audience.
00:18:07 I get, I get why nobody cares.
00:18:09 Man, she wanted to disassociate from his lectures completely.
00:18:13 Like that's, yeah, that's completely reasonable.
00:18:16 But that one's fair enough because he was the one doing it.
00:18:18 But DeVoo was just sitting there.
00:18:20 She was just, I mean, fucking.
00:18:22 Uh, mother's basement was in the audience and like mother's basement is not
00:18:28 having a fucking, we also have us having a fucking nobody.
00:18:31 Nobody gives a shit.
00:18:32 Nobody just wait until Jeff, just wait until Jeff's runs for senator and
00:18:37 then they'll pick up the PCP episodes and then he'll be fucking ruined.
00:18:40 Have me executed.
00:18:41 Yeah.
00:18:42 Uh, oh, well, you know, that's, that's, that's life.
00:18:46 So, so Ash and me have been listening to, uh, Chris story that podcast, uh, by
00:18:53 Asteris and Sri Lanka about the entire story of Chris Chan.
00:18:57 And I want to ask you, Ben, they said, they, they said they were going to have
00:19:01 been on an episode, I think you're both like, you're both just being like, Hey,
00:19:04 I'm wondering when that person's going to come on it.
00:19:07 And you're just kind of a standstill.
00:19:09 Someone needs to go.
00:19:10 Hey, they keep saying it every few episodes that that's going to happen at some point.
00:19:15 They want to, I haven't, I haven't, I haven't really talked to either of them
00:19:19 in, in quite a while.
00:19:20 You know, I think the plan might have been that I would be on like a live episode.
00:19:25 Like I think at some point they were planning on like traveling to the area.
00:19:29 And then it was like, okay, I'll be on an episode in person and then COVID
00:19:34 happened and then travel plans all stopped.
00:19:36 And so I think that might have, uh, down to go to Boston.
00:19:41 Well, I mean, I would be on an episode, I'd be on that any, any time I was invited.
00:19:48 Okay, I'll tell Sirius myself.
00:19:50 I think he follows me.
00:19:51 Yeah. I mean, does he?
00:19:53 Yeah, he follows me on Twitter.
00:19:56 Oh, that's cool.
00:19:57 He follows me too.
00:19:58 Uh, he's, uh, okay.
00:20:00 Uh, yeah, I don't, I don't, I mean, okay, I would like to be on, I'd like to do this.
00:20:05 That sounds like fun.
00:20:07 It is just fun hearing Sirius be very disgusted and distressed by everything Sirius tells him.
00:20:14 Um,
00:20:15 Right. Sirius, Sirius, like is the one that knows stuff and is like explaining.
00:20:20 Yeah.
00:20:21 Basically, yeah.
00:20:22 Okay.
00:20:23 I, I, I haven't actually listened to it myself.
00:20:27 Uh, I, I know what it's about.
00:20:29 Cause I mean, I'm already, I know everything.
00:20:31 Yeah, of course.
00:20:32 I don't need, I don't need to be educated.
00:20:36 It's fun watching a older man be horrified.
00:20:40 By the horrors of the internet.
00:20:42 Just, just horrified.
00:20:44 Just in general.
00:20:45 Yeah.
00:20:48 How old is, how old are you?
00:20:49 He just turned 40.
00:20:50 What's he like, 40?
00:20:51 He just turned 40.
00:20:52 It's basically dead.
00:20:53 Okay.
00:20:54 I would, I would have thought he was maybe like,
00:20:55 He's younger than Dan ever, Dan, I think.
00:20:58 Yeah.
00:20:59 I don't, I don't think I like Dan.
00:21:04 I don't think I like that he exists.
00:21:07 That he exists?
00:21:08 Are you gonna do something about it?
00:21:10 Maybe, maybe I will.
00:21:12 You know, maybe I will.
00:21:13 You could complain about him on your podcast.
00:21:16 I, yeah, I don't have any specific grievances.
00:21:20 I just kind of think I don't like his vibe.
00:21:23 And that's all I got.
00:21:25 Well, that's where the world stayed.
00:21:28 Okay.
00:21:29 Uh, true.
00:21:31 Um, shit.
00:21:33 Well, what else is going on?
00:21:36 I have just got back, this is the reason I've been on the last episode is I just got back
00:21:41 from a family holiday with the dog at, at Bog Neregis.
00:21:46 Just the dog?
00:21:47 You?
00:21:48 No, the family.
00:21:49 Why do you go, why do you go to all these places with silly names?
00:21:52 The Agunary and the, and the Bog Neregis.
00:21:54 Bog Neregis is a very silly name.
00:21:57 Agunary is also a very silly thing name.
00:21:59 But, uh, I don't know.
00:22:02 It's the UK.
00:22:03 What do you want?
00:22:04 Everything silly over here.
00:22:06 Going to the old, the old, the old cobbler down to the cobbler down on the, the Haberdasher
00:22:13 Street and an old, an old London town.
00:22:17 Okay.
00:22:18 That's the silliest thing I could think of.
00:22:20 Beans, beans on toast.
00:22:22 Beans on cobblestone.
00:22:24 Yes.
00:22:25 Delicious.
00:22:26 Uh, yeah, but that was nice.
00:22:28 It's the seaside town.
00:22:30 Um, when I say with the dog, it's like every so often my family wants to take the dog with them on holiday instead of just going on holiday without him.
00:22:37 Um, but obviously he's a dog and he's very wriggly and he very hard to control so we can't just go anywhere.
00:22:44 So it's usually a local place and this time it's, you know, a beach.
00:22:49 So he's running around on the beach, doesn't understand seawater, would splash in the seawater and lie down to keep cool.
00:22:56 Get a mouthful of seawater and then pick it up later because he didn't know it was bad.
00:23:02 So classic stupid dog stuff and it was great.
00:23:05 That's, that's sweet.
00:23:07 Uh, how old's the dog?
00:23:09 He's pretty young, right?
00:23:11 You just got him like a couple years ago.
00:23:13 He's like, yeah, he's all, I think he's four or five and we've had him since he was a tiny baby puppy the size of a tennis ball.
00:23:21 Aw.
00:23:22 Geez.
00:23:24 He's so cute and he's, he's a good boy.
00:23:28 It's funny that I say tennis ball because he loves tennis ball.
00:23:30 He's always got a tennis ball in his mouth.
00:23:32 It reminds him of himself as a young good dog.
00:23:36 Uh, um.
00:23:39 Yeah, I basically just wanted to mention Bognoregis because Bognoregis is such a silly name and I like saying it.
00:23:44 The name is wonderful.
00:23:45 The name of a town?
00:23:46 Yeah, Bognoregis.
00:23:48 You would think it's a swamp, but no.
00:23:51 Yeah, no, definitely.
00:23:54 The ocean's just the biggest swamp.
00:23:56 Well, I've been, I've been frantically working, trying to get my secret video project recorded before I move.
00:24:11 I'm moving at the end of the month.
00:24:14 Actually, I'm moving on the, I have to move out on the 30th instead of the 31st because my lease is fucked up.
00:24:20 I think my landlord was trying to trick me, trying to trap me into staying too late so she didn't, wouldn't have to give me my security.
00:24:26 I really, I genuinely think it was a trap, but I'm not going to fall for it.
00:24:32 But I'm, I'm scrambling.
00:24:35 So I have, oh God, I have only nine days left.
00:24:40 It sounds like nine days to record.
00:24:47 But to get ready to record and then to record.
00:24:50 Yeah.
00:24:51 I don't know.
00:24:52 It sounds like a lot of time.
00:24:54 You also have to pack and stuff.
00:24:56 Get your stuff ready.
00:24:57 Yeah, I do.
00:24:59 I have to hire a van to get everything.
00:25:02 I do have to arrange for a truck.
00:25:05 I have to arrange for a truck.
00:25:07 And then I have to figure out what I'm going to do because I have to be out on the 30th and I can't move in until the first.
00:25:14 So I'm going to have to find accommodations for two nights and I'll probably have to park the truck somewhere.
00:25:23 So I'll have to rent it for three days.
00:25:25 Yeah.
00:25:26 It's, it's, and I have to.
00:25:28 So I have to sort all that out in the next nine days or so.
00:25:33 Okay, but what if you just put your bed in the truck and sleep in the truck?
00:25:37 Your bed's already in there, right?
00:25:40 It would be dark in there.
00:25:44 It'd be like camping.
00:25:46 It'd be like, it's like a big metal tent.
00:25:48 Bring a flashlight.
00:25:49 Oh God.
00:25:50 Bring some slime that I feel like glows green.
00:25:53 Yeah, bring my jug of fluorescent slime and my black light to illuminate.
00:26:01 To read by slime light.
00:26:03 All the blood stains all over the truck.
00:26:06 Illuminated, yeah.
00:26:10 Okay, well that's, well that's a, anyway, so all that, yeah.
00:26:14 Nine day, nine days to record a video sounds like a lot of time, but I have things I want to get ready and I don't know if they're ready and I don't,
00:26:25 I don't know if it's going to take me one or two or three or four days to get them ready.
00:26:29 And then I don't know how many days it's going to take me on top of that to be doing all these preparations and stuff and sorting shit out.
00:26:38 And I don't even know, it's really late.
00:26:40 I'm really late to getting a truck.
00:26:42 Like I've left it way too long and it's a big problem and I might be fucked.
00:26:46 I'm sure I can figure something out, but I should not have waited this long to get a truck.
00:26:52 Do it right after the recording.
00:26:56 Yeah, that would be the smartest thing to do.
00:26:59 But would it be what Ben St. would do?
00:27:01 Yeah, but you know, historically, I have not done that.
00:27:07 So what are the odds I'm going to do at this time?
00:27:09 Wait, if you know the exact time you need to go, just call a thing now.
00:27:14 Well, not now, but like after the podcast.
00:27:17 Look, all I'm saying is that I might, I don't know, there's a chance that I might call up every U-Haul in town and they might all be like,
00:27:25 nah, we don't have any trucks.
00:27:27 Nah, it's too late.
00:27:28 It is summer.
00:27:30 People are moving.
00:27:32 It's summer and yeah, start of September is when everybody moves.
00:27:36 That's the busiest time.
00:27:38 So like, no, I really fucked up.
00:27:40 I've really fucked myself.
00:27:42 I don't know.
00:27:44 Time to build a truck.
00:27:46 I don't know exactly how fucked I am.
00:27:48 Do you have a large wheelbarrow?
00:27:50 100%.
00:27:52 Do you have like a really huge piece of like polka dot red?
00:27:56 Red with white polka dot like fabric and a long stick.
00:27:59 You could like have everything like sling it over your shoulder.
00:28:03 Oh, you know, just call an Uber and let them drive back and forth a few times.
00:28:07 That'd be so expensive.
00:28:09 Yes.
00:28:10 No, it wouldn't work because I can't move in until two days later.
00:28:15 Oh yeah, right.
00:28:16 You dingus.
00:28:17 Yeah.
00:28:18 Can't move in until first.
00:28:19 Take it straight to wherever the heck you're staying.
00:28:22 I just need, I need to get it.
00:28:24 I need to get a big truck by some somehow.
00:28:28 Somehow I need to get one and I need to have it for two days, maybe three days.
00:28:33 And then everything's all that's all I need.
00:28:36 That's all I need.
00:28:37 Is it going to be easy?
00:28:38 Well, good luck with that.
00:28:39 So easy.
00:28:40 Yeah, I would prioritize figuring that out before recording whatever the thing.
00:28:45 Yeah.
00:28:46 You're right.
00:28:47 Because even if I don't get it recorded before I move, like it's kind of fine and doesn't matter.
00:28:51 I just wanted to, you know, like I sort of set myself a deadline and I'm like, I don't
00:28:57 want to miss my deadline because like keeping deadlines is how you get things done.
00:29:02 Yeah.
00:29:03 But I mean, yeah, like whatever, that's just a psychological trick and things that are
00:29:10 in your mind aren't real.
00:29:12 You don't easily get tricked by yourself.
00:29:14 No.
00:29:15 You don't have to fall for it.
00:29:17 I don't.
00:29:18 I don't get tricked by myself.
00:29:20 I can't trick myself into doing things.
00:29:22 And that's why I don't do as many things as I should do.
00:29:25 You trick yourself into not doing anything.
00:29:27 Because I'm so smart.
00:29:29 And I think that's just me trying to trick myself into being productive.
00:29:32 But I know better.
00:29:33 I won't fall for it.
00:29:34 And I'm too clever.
00:29:38 Yeah.
00:29:40 So I've been scrambling.
00:29:42 I've been scrambling with that and it sucks.
00:29:46 Shitty week.
00:29:47 Shitty week, all things considered.
00:29:49 No.
00:29:50 I'm sorry.
00:29:51 We had a really great week.
00:29:52 We've got another shitty week coming up.
00:29:55 Oh, well, good for you.
00:29:57 I'm so happy for you.
00:30:00 We had all our friends over from the sketchy peoples.
00:30:04 Not all of them, but everyone who could make it.
00:30:07 And we had a big old meetup at my place for like a whole week.
00:30:11 Do you guys all live in like a similar area?
00:30:15 Absolutely not.
00:30:17 Yeah.
00:30:18 Who could make it?
00:30:19 Well, James came from Madrid.
00:30:22 James Tolbert.
00:30:23 Exactly.
00:30:24 The very one and only.
00:30:27 I know him.
00:30:28 Stefan Tantana from Austria.
00:30:32 The artist, right?
00:30:34 The artist almost became PCP editor back in the day.
00:30:39 Oh, that's right.
00:30:41 Back when he was green flowers.
00:30:44 Green fleshy flowers.
00:30:45 Oh.
00:30:46 Did he make, he made the one that was all the TV screens?
00:30:50 Exactly.
00:30:51 Yeah.
00:30:52 And we used this kind of a similar thing for the sketchy people later.
00:30:57 I think I pushed for him.
00:31:00 I did like that.
00:31:01 I really liked that sketchy like CRT monitor setup.
00:31:06 Yeah.
00:31:07 Yeah.
00:31:08 He's a professional animator, boy now working for ads and stuff.
00:31:15 Rules.
00:31:17 Wait, who else made it?
00:31:18 Oh yeah, Alex.
00:31:19 Alex C. Bell.
00:31:21 The music boy.
00:31:22 Is that Alex SSSS?
00:31:23 Yes.
00:31:24 Yes.
00:31:25 Exactly.
00:31:26 Where is he from?
00:31:28 Germany as well.
00:31:30 Yeah.
00:31:31 The very other side of Germany from where I live.
00:31:35 And me.
00:31:36 And you.
00:31:38 Are you two like roommates?
00:31:40 No.
00:31:41 No.
00:31:42 We're just dating.
00:31:45 Oh, okay.
00:31:46 I see.
00:31:47 So are you just visiting?
00:31:49 Yeah.
00:31:50 Or do you work together?
00:31:51 No.
00:31:52 Okay.
00:31:53 No, we have some very city long distance thing going on.
00:31:58 Oh, damn.
00:31:59 Yeah.
00:32:00 That's pretty far.
00:32:02 Yeah.
00:32:03 Yes.
00:32:04 Very.
00:32:05 Like we've been together for like two and a half years now and we first met each
00:32:10 other last Christmas.
00:32:12 In person.
00:32:13 Yeah.
00:32:14 Yeah.
00:32:15 In person.
00:32:16 Because the pandemic kind of just prevented everything.
00:32:19 Like restrictions were pretty bad for a long time.
00:32:22 At least on the Canadian side.
00:32:23 And also I had to run away from home first.
00:32:26 Yeah.
00:32:27 Is that true?
00:32:28 Yes.
00:32:29 Well, what?
00:32:31 Is that a thing you can talk about?
00:32:34 Yes.
00:32:35 I don't know the sum it up really other than my family's like weirdly controlling.
00:32:44 Okay.
00:32:45 My mom's a weirdo.
00:32:48 Yeah.
00:32:49 And she took advantage of a lot of me being sick to like make me dependent.
00:32:56 Hmm.
00:32:57 And then.
00:32:58 Sounds not good.
00:33:00 Yeah.
00:33:01 And.
00:33:02 Sounds not the best.
00:33:03 Plus I like going against kind of my religious background.
00:33:08 So, you know, like there's no way I would have been able to just go to Germany and see
00:33:16 never paint.
00:33:17 Hmm.
00:33:18 So I am and also just living them stressed me out.
00:33:23 And so I secretly moved out.
00:33:27 Okay.
00:33:28 Ran away.
00:33:29 You left.
00:33:30 You left a dump.
00:33:31 You left a ninja log decoy.
00:33:32 I did.
00:33:33 And one day your mom is going to throw a kunai at it and it's going to poo.
00:33:38 Shit.
00:33:39 Tricked.
00:33:40 Very nice.
00:33:41 Impressive.
00:33:42 Impressive Jutsu.
00:33:43 No, I literally just like went through all my stuff took the bare minimum necessities
00:33:53 I needed.
00:33:54 Hmm.
00:33:55 And like gone Uber and just hauled.
00:33:58 Oh my God.
00:34:00 Wait, so where did you go?
00:34:02 I just know I just moved to like an apartment.
00:34:06 Hmm.
00:34:07 Like I've just prepared all this in secret.
00:34:10 Yeah.
00:34:11 Yeah, I see.
00:34:12 I see.
00:34:13 And then they didn't and they like don't know where you're at.
00:34:17 Well, I let my sister know at this point because I trust her.
00:34:21 But like, I'm used to tell really anybody.
00:34:24 Yeah.
00:34:25 Where I am.
00:34:26 Yeah.
00:34:27 I'm just like, I'm just going to stay away.
00:34:29 Yeah.
00:34:30 Got to do what you got to do.
00:34:33 And then I had to like demand my IDs back because my mom kept them all in safe.
00:34:40 Oh, got to have your IDs.
00:34:44 Yeah, I mean, that's a serious situation.
00:34:47 That's a bummer.
00:34:48 Yeah.
00:34:49 Good for you to get out of there.
00:34:50 Yeah.
00:34:51 I could probably I probably could write a comic about it someday.
00:34:55 But it's a story.
00:34:57 It is a tale.
00:34:59 That's what all artists thought about.
00:35:01 And then I got as soon as a guy, I'm like, let's get ready for Christmas.
00:35:05 Let's go.
00:35:06 I mean, that was like, all right.
00:35:08 That was, yeah, that that had to happen before you two could meet.
00:35:13 I understand.
00:35:14 Yeah.
00:35:15 Yeah.
00:35:16 Yeah.
00:35:17 Gotcha.
00:35:18 Gotcha.
00:35:19 Yeah.
00:35:20 But very, very lucky that that all worked out now.
00:35:23 And also that Asha could also meet some of her other friends besides me in real life finally.
00:35:31 It's annoying how you like make friends through internet podcasts.
00:35:38 And then they are like all over the world.
00:35:41 You meet the best people in the world and then they're all really far away.
00:35:47 Yep.
00:35:48 Yeah.
00:35:49 True.
00:35:50 True.
00:35:51 Still a problem for me.
00:35:52 Yeah.
00:35:53 Yeah.
00:35:54 I guess there are a few people around that I could visit in the UK.
00:35:59 And you know, Europe is not very far away.
00:36:02 But Boston is like the hub.
00:36:05 That's where I need to go for like maximum like, oh my God.
00:36:09 But also you really wouldn't want to move to the US though because that sounds like a hellhole.
00:36:15 It's not that bad.
00:36:18 It's not that bad.
00:36:20 It's scary with all the news of like, I don't know, rising like completely bloodthirsty
00:36:28 transphobia in war.
00:36:30 Sure.
00:36:31 Like that's a little scary.
00:36:32 Yeah.
00:36:33 But what are you going to do?
00:36:34 What are you going to do?
00:36:35 You know, you got to take the good with the bad sometimes.
00:36:38 I'll just come over and I'll like I'll buy a gun because that's easy to do and I'll just
00:36:42 defend myself.
00:36:43 Exactly.
00:36:44 Easy peasy.
00:36:45 You're sounding like an American already.
00:36:49 I mean, Massachusetts is not really America.
00:36:53 It's basically like Europe, but on the other side of the ponds.
00:36:57 I guess it's the only part that is not completely spoiled yet, maybe one of the few parts.
00:37:02 No, we're good.
00:37:04 I swear, I promise.
00:37:05 You know, I guess it's pretty fortunate that, you know, I just happened to work out that
00:37:12 I live in the same town now as Munchie and Kazi.
00:37:17 That's pretty cool.
00:37:18 Although, although I haven't seen them in a while, it's been like more than a month,
00:37:25 actually.
00:37:26 They've been traveling.
00:37:27 Yeah, they've been.
00:37:28 I've heard about it.
00:37:30 Yeah, they've been, they've been.
00:37:32 Summer holiday, various things.
00:37:35 Yes.
00:37:36 Yeah, I should.
00:37:38 I should reach out.
00:37:39 I think Munchie is getting back soon-ish.
00:37:43 I think he's back now.
00:37:45 Oh, shit.
00:37:46 Well, neat.
00:37:47 Cool.
00:37:48 But, yeah, just sort of worked out that we ended up in the same town, so that's kind of nice.
00:37:57 But, what were we talking about?
00:38:06 And next Thursday, we're going, we're both going to Canada.
00:38:10 So, I'm going to visit Archer first.
00:38:12 She visits me.
00:38:13 I visit her.
00:38:14 I actually have to, I have to go to Canada because of my university, because I have to
00:38:21 spend a certain amount of time in an English-speaking country, as that's part of my requirements.
00:38:29 I see.
00:38:30 So, I can do that two in one, because I'm going to be an English teacher one day.
00:38:35 Like, English as a second language.
00:38:38 Epic.
00:38:39 And art.
00:38:40 Yeah, that's going to be a lot of fun.
00:38:43 You know, teaching English as a second language is a job that you can do anywhere.
00:38:51 I mean, anywhere-
00:38:52 Not really.
00:38:53 No?
00:38:54 Well, the thing is, you kind of also need to know the language of the country that you're
00:39:01 in.
00:39:02 Yeah, you kind of need to know.
00:39:03 You know-
00:39:04 Get by with just some eyebrow-raising and body-movements.
00:39:07 At least on lower levels.
00:39:08 I guess on higher levels, it works better, but I couldn't teach fifth graders in Poland,
00:39:15 because I don't know Polish.
00:39:16 And if they have a question and can't speak English yet, I don't have a chance.
00:39:21 So, I'm kind of limited to German-speaking countries.
00:39:25 What would you say is the closest other language that seems like it could-
00:39:32 German would be similar enough that you could switch to-
00:39:37 Dutch?
00:39:38 Yeah.
00:39:39 Yeah, Dutch is kind of like-
00:39:40 It sounds very German with some English and French mixed in.
00:39:44 Yeah, that would work, I guess.
00:39:48 Perhaps.
00:39:49 I mean, there's also German schools in a lot of countries.
00:39:55 Right here.
00:39:57 That could all work.
00:40:00 I mean, I remember when I went to Poland, a lot of people that I met there were English.
00:40:07 They worked teaching English, and I guess maybe they did know Polish.
00:40:13 I didn't speak Polish, really, but I wasn't teaching English.
00:40:18 I was teaching physics, so I didn't really-
00:40:21 And I was teaching in English, so I didn't really have to-
00:40:24 What age were the students you were teaching?
00:40:28 They were just out of high school.
00:40:32 It was like a college prep.
00:40:34 It was a college prep class.
00:40:37 Basically, I must have been 24, 24, 25.
00:40:50 So, I guess that'd be like 10 years ago, wow.
00:40:55 It's older than I am.
00:40:57 No, 20, I think that was in like 2010, so I would have been like 22.
00:41:04 And they would have been like 18 younger than I am.
00:41:08 No, it was later than that.
00:41:10 It must have been 2012 or 2014 or something.
00:41:14 2016, 2018, you know.
00:41:17 I want to say it was about 2012.
00:41:20 But anyway, the kids were like 17, 18, 19, something like that.
00:41:24 Yeah, that makes sense.
00:41:26 They should know enough English by then.
00:41:28 Yeah, because they were basically just relearning subjects
00:41:32 that they had already learned in school in Saudi Arabia.
00:41:35 It was like a university prep class or something.
00:41:38 They were basically just relearning them in English.
00:41:41 Yeah, we have those to get ready for university
00:41:44 because schools don't actually teach you
00:41:47 already enough for university requirements and STEM stuff.
00:41:51 So, that's often required.
00:41:55 Yeah, but like I said, I didn't have to know Polish.
00:42:01 Because the kids didn't speak Polish.
00:42:04 They spoke...
00:42:06 Shit, what language do they speak in Saudi Arabia?
00:42:12 Arabic?
00:42:13 Arabic, yes, there you go.
00:42:15 Probably?
00:42:16 I don't remember the Saudi part of it.
00:42:19 I just remember you were a physics teacher in Poland.
00:42:23 Yeah, they were from Saudi Arabia.
00:42:25 They were...
00:42:27 They sometimes talked about the king.
00:42:31 As you do.
00:42:33 As you do.
00:42:35 The...
00:42:36 Elvis?
00:42:37 They didn't have anime in Saudi Arabia,
00:42:40 but they could watch anime in Poland,
00:42:43 so I thought that was pretty cool.
00:42:45 Did they hear about it in Saudi Arabia?
00:42:48 Is it like a secret?
00:42:49 I believe so.
00:42:50 Yeah, I think they just didn't really have much access to it.
00:42:54 It's a lot of it was banned or something for whatever reason.
00:42:59 Yeah, but surely they could have watched it online,
00:43:02 like we all did.
00:43:04 I don't know.
00:43:06 I mean, this was a long time ago.
00:43:08 VPNs didn't really exist.
00:43:10 Oh, yeah, fair.
00:43:13 Maybe.
00:43:15 You probably would have had to get it on some kind of black market,
00:43:18 the USB drive or something.
00:43:21 Get it on three parts on YouTube.
00:43:24 Yeah.
00:43:26 Maybe.
00:43:27 Yeah, in 240p quality.
00:43:29 Yes.
00:43:31 3x4 resolution, of course.
00:43:34 That's how we watched the Dungeons & Dragons episode of Community today,
00:43:38 because it got pulled off Netflix.
00:43:42 Right, they've been pulling shows.
00:43:44 No, there was services be pulling shows.
00:43:46 No, this was years ago.
00:43:47 Yeah, that was a while ago.
00:43:49 This is a specific episode because it had a joke
00:43:52 where a character did blackface.
00:43:57 You know, have I complained about the episode of Golden Girls
00:44:01 that got pulled for blackface?
00:44:04 Because they straight up just aren't doing blackface
00:44:07 in the episode of Golden Girls that got pulled for blackface.
00:44:09 Wait, episode of Golden Girls got banned?
00:44:11 Yeah, well, it got taken off Netflix.
00:44:17 The joke is that Dorothy has a black friend
00:44:20 and the black friend comes over and B,
00:44:23 no, Blanche and Rose,
00:44:29 they're doing spa treatments, so they're wearing mud masks.
00:44:33 So they come out wearing their mud mask and they're like,
00:44:35 oh, no, no, this isn't, we're not, this isn't,
00:44:38 they're trying to explain.
00:44:40 So like, the whole joke is that they're not doing blackface
00:44:43 and yet that episode got pulled from Netflix.
00:44:46 It's a misunderstanding.
00:44:47 For blackface.
00:44:48 I mean, that's a sad thing there.
00:44:49 Who woke SJWs have gone too far this time?
00:44:53 Or it's just the producers weren't understanding.
00:44:55 Where's my Golden Girls?
00:45:00 It's a funny joke.
00:45:02 Okay.
00:45:03 It's a shame because in advance,
00:45:05 Dungeons & Dragons is one of the best episodes of community.
00:45:09 It's great.
00:45:11 I always love when a show does a D&D episode.
00:45:15 I'm a sucker for that.
00:45:18 You should watch Stranger Things.
00:45:23 I have not seen the new, I did watch the first season
00:45:26 of Stranger Things.
00:45:27 Did they do a D&D episode of My Little Pony?
00:45:29 Yeah, it was Boys Gamer Night with Discord, Big Mac, Spike,
00:45:35 and Discord like made like,
00:45:38 I think there's some other character there, I forgot who,
00:45:41 and Discord like made things real because he's Discord.
00:45:45 And they were like, oh God, Discord,
00:45:47 you're actually going to kill us with these monsters.
00:45:49 He said, I'm just playing.
00:45:51 I don't think that's what they were trying to, but okay.
00:45:54 Never mind.
00:45:55 That sounds terrible.
00:45:57 I think I would have hated it.
00:45:59 It was later season MLP.
00:46:01 Yeah, I've definitely have not seen that one.
00:46:04 Do you watch that, Asha?
00:46:05 Yes, I've seen all of MLP.
00:46:07 Oh God.
00:46:08 Oh my God.
00:46:09 100% completion rate.
00:46:10 Yes.
00:46:11 I stopped at like season five, I think.
00:46:15 No, no, Asha, Asha, it's like an old movie.
00:46:18 The last few episodes of the last few seasons are such a weird like...
00:46:22 They are so strange.
00:46:24 There's the final battle between all of the biggest villains
00:46:29 coming back together to team up.
00:46:31 Plus all of the kids from all of the different races
00:46:36 that come to the school and the main six
00:46:38 and a bunch of other people.
00:46:39 And they all come...
00:46:40 And Starshall, the birdie and all of his ancient friends
00:46:43 who came back from the thing when they did that.
00:46:45 And they all come together and they go...
00:46:49 Yeah, that's what they do.
00:46:50 It's just, I can't remember what happened.
00:46:53 But at the end, Twilight has a really long neck
00:46:56 and that's the main thing that matters.
00:46:57 I can't remember what happened,
00:46:59 but I remember that I didn't like it.
00:47:02 She became a long-born.
00:47:04 And her friends became old boys.
00:47:06 She's right.
00:47:08 The age is the very first, very last thing
00:47:12 is that we confirmed that Twilight will live forever
00:47:15 and her friends will all age and die
00:47:17 and she will just have to watch.
00:47:20 She's again making new friends.
00:47:22 No, she can't.
00:47:24 Celestia never made friends.
00:47:26 Yes, she does.
00:47:28 Pony's made for life, I'm sorry.
00:47:30 Once your friends die there, you can't make anymore.
00:47:33 What happened to Twilight in the new metal pony, Jen?
00:47:37 We don't know that, huh?
00:47:39 It's very...
00:47:40 I saw the movie, I don't think...
00:47:42 Well, she's been relegated to myth.
00:47:44 Yeah.
00:47:46 So...
00:47:47 I don't know what the new lore is with the new TV series.
00:47:52 Is that out now?
00:47:53 No, but there's a special, at least one.
00:47:57 And it's terrible.
00:47:59 At least it looks and sounds terrible.
00:48:01 The movie came out like two years ago.
00:48:03 What are they waiting for?
00:48:04 I don't know.
00:48:05 But at least I think the show is not on.
00:48:07 But I really like the movie.
00:48:09 I like the performances and the songs a lot.
00:48:11 I thought the movie was alright.
00:48:13 The movie had its moments.
00:48:15 It was neat.
00:48:16 I didn't hate it.
00:48:17 The thing is...
00:48:18 Which is a lot for me.
00:48:19 The TV special or the Netflix special that did a bit ago,
00:48:23 it looks horrible because it's kind of the same CG style of the movie,
00:48:29 but much worse than it was the animated.
00:48:32 And it looks very stiff and weirdly shaded.
00:48:36 And also they replaced all the voice actors, which were pretty good.
00:48:41 And yeah.
00:48:42 All the swabs doing it for the actors.
00:48:45 They didn't get Ken Jeong back to play a red guy?
00:48:49 It's terrible.
00:48:51 I guess they can't afford him.
00:48:52 Why would you do that?
00:48:53 Why would you make such a big event movie and not followed up?
00:48:59 Just like how they couldn't get Robin Williams to play Genie in the Aladdin sequels and the animated show.
00:49:06 So they got...
00:49:07 They got...
00:49:08 Ugh!
00:49:09 Guess we got to settle for Dan Castle and Edda.
00:49:11 Ugh!
00:49:12 God!
00:49:15 Do any of these Disney TV sequels have the original actors?
00:49:19 Some of them must.
00:49:21 Some of them must.
00:49:22 I think they did get Gilbert Godfrey to continue to be Iago,
00:49:26 because I mean, what else was he going to do?
00:49:29 Well, who else could be that voice as well?
00:49:33 Yeah, I mean true.
00:49:35 But I mean, if he were as big a star as Robin Williams,
00:49:40 they would have just had to say fuck it and suck it up and get someone.
00:49:45 Fortunately, he's just...
00:49:48 Fortunately, Gilbert Godfrey likes doing things.
00:49:51 Fortunately, he's just Gilbert Godfrey and he...
00:49:54 Yeah, did he die?
00:49:56 Yeah, he died recently.
00:49:58 That's too bad.
00:49:59 Yeah, I thought so.
00:50:03 Did you see that episode of the Angry Video Game Nerd starring Gilbert Godfrey?
00:50:07 I think I saw parts of it.
00:50:09 As Fred Fuchs, the explorer.
00:50:12 Yeah, I think I saw parts of it.
00:50:15 I don't think I watched the whole thing.
00:50:17 I think it was awkward.
00:50:18 It was awkward.
00:50:19 I think I remember it was really awkward.
00:50:21 James is such an awkward person on camera with other actors.
00:50:25 He's not good at that, but it was funny just the fact that it happened.
00:50:31 It wasn't good, but the fact that it happened is worth celebrating.
00:50:37 No worth celebrating.
00:50:39 I'm just like, wow, wow, what?
00:50:43 Noteworthy.
00:50:44 It felt like Gilbert didn't really know what he was doing either.
00:50:49 Yeah.
00:50:50 Can you imagine getting there and having the nerd direct you?
00:50:56 You're like, okay, your motivation in this scene is that you hate this video game and you're really angry and you're going to yell at it while you play.
00:51:04 You're going to yell at it.
00:51:05 You're going to talk about how you'd rather put your balls in a blender.
00:51:11 I want you to compare the game to poop, but I want you to come up with some different kinds of poop that you could compare it to.
00:51:20 Different consistencies, different animals.
00:51:24 Okay, go.
00:51:26 Spitball.
00:51:27 Right.
00:51:28 James Rolfe is a character.
00:51:30 What do you call it?
00:51:32 Character director?
00:51:33 Yeah.
00:51:34 I forget the term.
00:51:36 I'm not sure, but I think I know what you mean.
00:51:39 Name Gilbert Gottfried sounds like an Elden Ring character.
00:51:43 I think it might just be an Elden Ring character, actually.
00:51:47 Yeah, my player character.
00:51:48 I hope not.
00:51:49 I hope not.
00:51:50 Hey, Gimm.
00:51:51 Elden Ring streams.
00:51:53 When?
00:51:54 Oh.
00:51:55 Well, the reason I stopped that was because no one watched it.
00:52:00 I watched it.
00:52:01 I killed Mog.
00:52:03 I killed Mog and there was no one watching.
00:52:05 I was like, what am I doing?
00:52:06 Damn, I'm sorry.
00:52:07 I was probably sleeping.
00:52:08 No, no, no.
00:52:09 I'm not trying to kill people.
00:52:11 That is the reason I was like, okay.
00:52:13 I was taking it very seriously for some reason.
00:52:17 I really wanted to get my whole Elden Ring experience streamed,
00:52:22 and I was sort of doing it even though I didn't want to.
00:52:27 And now I will continue it.
00:52:30 I do want to, but I'm still playing Elden Ring for a while.
00:52:35 Yeah.
00:52:36 I don't know when, could be soon, could be a million years.
00:52:40 I've only been playing Elden Ring for the past half year.
00:52:44 There's no other video game that's important.
00:52:46 That's the only one.
00:52:48 I'm also really bad at it, so it takes me a long time.
00:52:51 I saw the new Never Knows Best video about how Elden Ring is bad.
00:53:00 I've heard a few people say Elden Ring is sort of, it's huge
00:53:05 and it's impressive, but replay value isn't that high for some reason.
00:53:09 What was Never Knows?
00:53:10 I mean, he didn't say bad.
00:53:11 He said it was disappointing because it could have been a lot better.
00:53:14 What did he say?
00:53:16 Boss variety, bad.
00:53:21 The game is easy if you look up the meta and build according to the meta
00:53:29 and hard if you don't do that.
00:53:31 The game assumes you will use guides to play it.
00:53:34 If you do that, it's easy and otherwise it's a nightmare.
00:53:36 That's what he said.
00:53:38 He said that's bad.
00:53:40 That's bad design and it's bad game philosophy.
00:53:44 I've always felt similar just because I never like looking at guides,
00:53:51 but as guides and as games have come out, as the internet has grown
00:53:59 in relevance to gamers in the world,
00:54:02 the idea of looking up something when you're stuck
00:54:05 is something that game developers have had to work around.
00:54:10 They can't really make something that's secret.
00:54:14 If you can look it up and solve the secret,
00:54:17 they've got to try and make it, I don't know, design it differently.
00:54:21 Now, I think there is a blanket sort of acceptance that,
00:54:27 yeah, people use guides, they'll go on the wiki,
00:54:30 the wiki will be made within a month,
00:54:32 fully formed with everything you could ever possibly want to know about the game.
00:54:36 In the game, you don't really need to explain that much
00:54:39 and for people who don't like looking up guides,
00:54:42 it sucks sometimes.
00:54:45 I understand that there's sort of like Dark Souls
00:54:51 and the whole Souls series and all the FromSoft games that have come out
00:54:54 since then, they're sort of built around this idea of the community.
00:54:57 They're all kind of built around the idea that people will come together
00:55:00 and help each other and sort of tell each other
00:55:04 what they're doing and advise each other
00:55:08 and warn each other about danger with signs and stuff.
00:55:13 I like the in-game versions of that,
00:55:16 with the people writing stuff on the floor.
00:55:18 I think that's all right.
00:55:19 I don't like the expectation that you should go elsewhere
00:55:23 to complete the game experience, as intended.
00:55:26 Yeah, that's kind of...
00:55:31 I sort of had to do that my first playthrough of Dark Souls.
00:55:36 The interface was so opaque and the character building
00:55:42 was so like, what is any of this doing?
00:55:45 I think I did go and look up some guides for stuff
00:55:49 and I was like, oh, okay.
00:55:51 And I think the game would have been stronger.
00:55:54 It would have had a better overall experience
00:55:56 if I had not had to do that,
00:55:58 if the game explained itself a little better.
00:56:03 Yeah.
00:56:04 Yeah, I mean, I played Dark Souls for the first time
00:56:07 after having watched the Digi Bros. Let's Play,
00:56:12 which is what made me realize that it was cool.
00:56:15 I was like, oh, look at all that.
00:56:17 That seems neat, and I bought it.
00:56:20 But I already knew a lot of the secrets.
00:56:22 I knew about Ash Lake.
00:56:24 I knew about what you should put your stats in.
00:56:27 Yeah.
00:56:28 And I had a very smooth time,
00:56:30 but I could imagine myself getting extremely frustrated.
00:56:33 If my first try at a character was a complete failure,
00:56:38 I put the stats in the wrong things
00:56:40 and it was extremely difficult going forward
00:56:42 and it would have been better for me
00:56:44 and much quicker and more efficient
00:56:45 if I deleted my character and started again.
00:56:47 But I wouldn't have known to do that
00:56:49 if I just played the game
00:56:51 and I would just assume that it was too hard.
00:56:54 Yeah, I picked it up blind
00:56:57 and I just fucked around in it
00:56:59 and I was like, what am I doing?
00:57:02 What am I doing wrong here?
00:57:05 I had to resort to a guide
00:57:08 and it was not fun to have to do that.
00:57:13 TBH.
00:57:15 I think guides as part of a gameplay experience
00:57:18 are at best neutral.
00:57:20 At best they don't negatively affect things,
00:57:22 but they don't improve as an experience.
00:57:24 I feel like it's always cooler
00:57:26 if you play the game
00:57:28 and then you come up with these things yourself
00:57:31 and then if you check the meta,
00:57:33 it turns out that the thing you naturally came to the conclusion of
00:57:36 was the way you should do it.
00:57:39 I admit, I think I use guides a lot,
00:57:43 but I'm also very new to playing video games in general
00:57:47 because I grew up with parents who didn't like video games
00:57:50 and I never had any consoles or computers that were good enough
00:57:53 to play most games.
00:57:56 So it already takes me probably five times as long
00:58:02 as most people to beat most games,
00:58:04 so I'm fine with having a guide
00:58:07 just to save my precious lifetime.
00:58:10 Some games just really waste your time
00:58:13 if you don't have that.
00:58:15 I looked up a giant map of the Hollow Knight thing
00:58:18 just to kind of know where I have to go
00:58:20 because it gets confusing at some point.
00:58:22 Hollow Knight is very...
00:58:24 Actually, I don't know.
00:58:26 I can't remember my first playthrough of Hollow Knight.
00:58:28 I don't know if I had seen content of guides before.
00:58:32 You streamed it too.
00:58:34 I streamed it and I had stream chat helping me sometimes,
00:58:37 so that would, I guess, count as extra help.
00:58:42 I was playing Mega Man ZX Advent
00:58:48 and ZX and ZX Advent have like...
00:58:52 They're sort of Metroidvania.
00:58:54 They kind of have big open worlds
00:58:56 and that's cool and I appreciate that,
00:58:59 but I also kind of just wanted to beat the game
00:59:02 and I didn't want to spend a lot of time
00:59:04 like kind of wandering around looking for stuff.
00:59:06 I know that's kind of the point of a world like that
00:59:09 is you kind of wander around and find stuff,
00:59:12 but I kind of just didn't want to spend the time,
00:59:15 so I did use a guide for a lot of stuff
00:59:17 that just told me like, where do I go next?
00:59:19 What's my next objective?
00:59:21 And I probably did hurt my experience of the game a little bit,
00:59:26 but also I got through it a lot faster and that's valuable.
00:59:29 It's just like watching a movie and putting subtitles on
00:59:33 because all the characters have weird accents
00:59:35 and you don't speak the language
00:59:37 and it's not your first language
00:59:39 and just helps you experience the movie better and quicker
00:59:42 and easier.
00:59:43 I don't know if it's like that,
00:59:45 because if you don't speak the language, you literally can't.
00:59:47 No, I mean like...
00:59:48 Experience the movie.
00:59:49 I guess, yeah.
00:59:51 But it's just making your experience easier
00:59:54 or like a little more accessible.
00:59:57 It doesn't ruin it necessarily.
01:00:01 I think...
01:00:02 I think I'm coming from a perspective where like,
01:00:04 I played PlayStation games,
01:00:06 I played Rayman or whatever,
01:00:08 I played Spyro.
01:00:09 When you play Spyro, the level is very small
01:00:12 compared to Elden Ring,
01:00:14 so you go around, you collect as many gems as you can
01:00:18 and then it's like, oh, there's five gems left
01:00:20 and I feel like I've been everywhere.
01:00:22 Where is it?
01:00:23 You run around the level,
01:00:25 you check everything twice, three times,
01:00:27 and it doesn't actually take that long to do it.
01:00:30 And there's a chance that you could actually figure out
01:00:33 a place that you maybe could glide to
01:00:35 that you haven't seen before and is that possible?
01:00:37 Oh my God, it is.
01:00:38 There's the gems.
01:00:39 You 100% completed the level without using a guide.
01:00:42 But if I was stuck on like something that would take me,
01:00:46 I don't know, 40 minutes, an hour, two hours,
01:00:49 three hours to figure it out for myself,
01:00:51 I am going to get tired
01:00:53 and I'm just going to YouTube like,
01:00:55 where do I fucking go?
01:00:57 So for small little games,
01:00:59 guides are not necessary at all.
01:01:03 And I prefer a few failures,
01:01:06 a few like little trials and errors to get to the end
01:01:09 and 100% complete.
01:01:11 But for something huge,
01:01:13 for something that's even like middleingly large,
01:01:15 or for a game that sucks, guides are great.
01:01:19 Guides are a good time saver.
01:01:22 Using a guide on Mega Man ZX
01:01:25 was the difference between me completing the game,
01:01:28 you know, like knowing where to go
01:01:30 instead of having to sort of wander around
01:01:32 and like check every door I've been through
01:01:35 and like talk to every NPC I've talked to before
01:01:37 and see if their dialogues changed
01:01:39 and see if any of the old doors have opened now
01:01:41 and like try and remember,
01:01:43 oh, was there a yellow door over there?
01:01:45 Oh, I should try that again, see if that leads anywhere.
01:01:47 It was the difference between me beating the game
01:01:49 in like seven hours versus like 12 hours.
01:01:52 And I just wanted those five hours.
01:01:54 I wanted to save those five hours.
01:01:56 I don't want to spend them fucking around.
01:01:59 Yeah.
01:02:00 You can only play so many video games.
01:02:02 I did, but I, you know,
01:02:04 I understand that by doing so,
01:02:06 I robbed myself of the joy of discovery going,
01:02:08 aha, I found it.
01:02:10 When Silk Song comes out,
01:02:12 I want to try to play it completely blind.
01:02:14 Oh, Silk Song.
01:02:16 Because it's going to be new
01:02:18 and nobody's going to have played it yet.
01:02:20 I'm going to play it first day and like know nothing
01:02:22 and have the pure experience.
01:02:25 That's a good one.
01:02:27 Is there any news on that?
01:02:29 Do we know when that's coming?
01:02:31 It's supposed, I think like a month ago or something,
01:02:33 there was an announcement and like a new short trailer
01:02:36 and they said it's supposedly coming out
01:02:39 within the next 20, no,
01:02:41 within the next 12 months.
01:02:43 Within the next 25 years it will come out.
01:02:45 No, within the next year, apparently.
01:02:47 Maybe.
01:02:49 We don't have a date though.
01:02:51 I feel like that's always the Silk Song news,
01:02:53 is like they've released
01:02:55 another three seconds of video footage.
01:02:57 That was the first news.
01:02:59 We don't know anything else.
01:03:01 There's this one channel on YouTube
01:03:03 called Daily Silk Song news
01:03:05 and they upload a video every single day.
01:03:07 Just like a tiny like
01:03:09 30 second thing.
01:03:11 Welcome to Daily Silk Song news.
01:03:13 Today there has been no Silk Song news.
01:03:15 And they talk about
01:03:17 every single snippet that releases.
01:03:19 It's a good channel.
01:03:21 And yeah.
01:03:23 I hope on like a day
01:03:25 when there's actually big Silk Song news
01:03:27 they forget to upload or like they give up
01:03:29 on that day and will be very sad.
01:03:33 Oh, I guess you know what?
01:03:35 You know what I've realized?
01:03:37 I think it's when it comes to
01:03:39 like a video game,
01:03:41 like what the appeal of the gameplay is.
01:03:43 If the point
01:03:45 of the game is about
01:03:47 figuring stuff out,
01:03:49 like a point and click or a mystery game
01:03:51 sort of thing.
01:03:53 Guides are
01:03:55 absolutely damaging to the experience.
01:03:57 If you get like
01:03:59 a little impatient or frustrated in a point and click game.
01:04:01 I mean some point and click games are just
01:04:03 obtuse to the point of
01:04:05 absurdity and it doesn't make sense how you
01:04:07 could figure stuff out. But some of them
01:04:09 you can. You just have to think
01:04:11 and
01:04:13 like it's so much
01:04:15 more satisfying coming to
01:04:17 the correct conclusion in a game like that
01:04:19 instead of using a guide.
01:04:21 But if you're playing a game
01:04:23 where the appeal is
01:04:25 like Minecraft, right?
01:04:27 The fun of Minecraft is building stuff
01:04:29 and
01:04:31 mining and
01:04:33 crafting and stuff.
01:04:35 Figuring out the lore or
01:04:37 rather just how you do
01:04:39 things is
01:04:41 completely impossible.
01:04:43 Like you can, there are some
01:04:45 fits of clues.
01:04:47 I guess they changed a bit.
01:04:49 They have like a recipe book now.
01:04:51 They changed a bit, but like if you wanted to know how to get into the Nether
01:04:53 you would just, and you had no
01:04:55 Minecraft experience, you would come across
01:04:57 you would have to be lucky enough
01:04:59 to come across like an unfinished Nether portal
01:05:01 and then
01:05:03 put the pieces together that you need to finish it
01:05:05 and then set it on fire so that you can go through
01:05:07 so you can get like access to a whole other section
01:05:09 of the game with all these important items that you need
01:05:11 to do all these other things.
01:05:13 They've only put these unfinished Nether portals in so that you have
01:05:15 a kind of a guide
01:05:17 that you play as one or something.
01:05:19 It was just expected to go to the Minecraft wiki
01:05:21 that was
01:05:23 part of the game kind of.
01:05:25 But that's the reason it's fine in Minecraft
01:05:27 because like
01:05:29 that experience of
01:05:31 understanding how the game works
01:05:33 is not as satisfying as finding a cool cave.
01:05:35 You don't need to do like
01:05:37 any wiki searching to know
01:05:39 what a cool cave is when you find it.
01:05:41 You know all the, you can look up
01:05:43 a guide on all of the things. It's just
01:05:45 whether you find them or not. That's the fun part.
01:05:47 Yeah.
01:05:49 Nobody agreed. Like
01:05:51 to the same extent if I want to look up
01:05:53 hey how do I get to this specific
01:05:55 boss in like
01:05:57 Elden Ring or Hollow Knight or whatever
01:05:59 like I can look that up and I still
01:06:01 have fun fighting that boss
01:06:03 that doesn't really take away from it that much.
01:06:05 It always depends on what you want
01:06:07 out of it and
01:06:09 what's like, what your time is worth
01:06:11 spending on certain tasks
01:06:13 in the game.
01:06:15 I really care for my time
01:06:17 which is why I play RuneScape
01:06:19 and I mine
01:06:21 iron for hours upon
01:06:23 hours every day.
01:06:25 I have no idea what RuneScape is. I heard the name for years.
01:06:27 I have no idea
01:06:29 what it even looks like.
01:06:31 I've seen it and I have a vague idea.
01:06:33 I have a general idea of what sort of things you do
01:06:35 in it. I can pitch RuneScape.
01:06:37 RuneScape is
01:06:39 an MMO
01:06:41 like a massively multiplayer online
01:06:43 role-playing video game, but instead
01:06:45 of being based off of World of Warcraft
01:06:47 like everything else, it came out
01:06:49 like before that or around the same time
01:06:51 and it's more based on
01:06:53 point and click
01:06:55 adventures and dungeons and dragons
01:06:57 where the world
01:06:59 is
01:07:01 it's more lived in.
01:07:03 There are NPCs that just talk about stuff
01:07:05 and the game is not about combat necessarily.
01:07:07 So there's fantasy things
01:07:09 but
01:07:11 the core of RuneScape is that you're in
01:07:13 just a fantasy realm
01:07:15 and there's lots of different skills you
01:07:17 can get higher.
01:07:19 There are many quests you can complete.
01:07:21 So you're running around as a little
01:07:23 video game guy and fight things too?
01:07:25 You run around
01:07:27 and you can do anything.
01:07:29 Combat level is like
01:07:31 a thing that you need if you want to live
01:07:33 in certain areas obviously. Enemies will throw rocks
01:07:35 at you, they'll punch you.
01:07:37 Certain quests require you to
01:07:39 defeat demons and vampires and stuff.
01:07:41 For some reason I always mentioned it
01:07:43 as like a puzzle game, like Candy Crush.
01:07:45 I don't know.
01:07:47 Something about the name. I told you about it?
01:07:49 Maybe? I don't know. I imagine
01:07:51 like a Candy Crush but with stone plates
01:07:53 that have runes on it. I thought that's what
01:07:55 RuneScape is. No.
01:07:57 No, you're a little polygon dude running around
01:07:59 doing medieval literature. You're a little
01:08:01 low poly. It's like a Java based
01:08:03 demo. Let me find
01:08:05 it's like the lowest poly models
01:08:07 you've ever seen. The lowest poly
01:08:09 this
01:08:11 is an okay image.
01:08:13 Here's an image of a RuneScape
01:08:15 character
01:08:17 who has a lot of levels actually. Fishing.
01:08:19 Fishing in a little pond.
01:08:21 That's adorable.
01:08:23 They're gonna get some fish and then they can
01:08:25 if you see the mini map in the top right
01:08:27 there's like the fishing spots there.
01:08:29 It looks like there's a fletching
01:08:31 or an arrow shop you can buy arrows from.
01:08:33 Thank you.
01:08:35 It's a quaint adorable
01:08:37 and
01:08:39 very, very, very, very, very
01:08:41 time consuming, old style
01:08:43 video game that I love playing. Does it still exist?
01:08:45 At the moment. I don't know.
01:08:47 Old school RuneScape does exist
01:08:49 as like a
01:08:51 like the fans wanted the old version
01:08:53 of the game because they updated it as time
01:08:55 of course.
01:08:57 And the old version of RuneScape
01:08:59 exists and is like
01:09:01 in like
01:09:03 what do you call it, active
01:09:05 support. There's like a team
01:09:07 that supports it.
01:09:09 And yeah, I've
01:09:11 I remember talking about RuneScape like a couple weeks
01:09:13 ago. I don't know whether I mentioned that I'm
01:09:15 on like a stupid
01:09:17 challenge run
01:09:19 that involves being extremely inefficient.
01:09:21 I think you did, but I mean
01:09:23 I don't remember the details.
01:09:25 Yes.
01:09:27 Because it's all gobbledygook to me.
01:09:29 It's all nonsense.
01:09:31 Yeah. No, I did
01:09:33 I do remember saying it, but basically
01:09:35 what I'm doing right now is I'm
01:09:37 mining iron in the mining guild.
01:09:39 I go up to a little ore rock
01:09:41 and I click on it and my guy does
01:09:43 a little animation. He gets an iron ore
01:09:45 or she does because it's she.
01:09:47 I change the gender. You can change your gender
01:09:49 in this game. You just walk to a little
01:09:51 witch and she says, what do you want?
01:09:53 I will change your face and you're like, okay.
01:09:55 I mean, that's just how it works in real life, right?
01:09:57 Yeah, basically.
01:10:01 And
01:10:03 actually this is funny. There's a quest
01:10:05 in RuneScape
01:10:07 that requires you be a female
01:10:09 to access a certain area
01:10:11 so that you can
01:10:13 do something. I can't remember what the quest was.
01:10:15 But
01:10:17 all of the characters who choose female
01:10:19 the beginning of the game
01:10:21 don't need to change their gender to do that.
01:10:23 But every male character is
01:10:25 force found by that quest.
01:10:27 So that's funny.
01:10:29 They have to be a female for like
01:10:31 a few minutes.
01:10:33 Got them.
01:10:35 Damn.
01:10:39 Yeah, but the moment I just
01:10:41 passed the point where I've got
01:10:43 50,000 iron ore in my bank.
01:10:45 I've collected
01:10:47 over 50,000 and I'm going for
01:10:49 100,000 because
01:10:51 that's the amount of iron ore I need
01:10:53 to make enough steel bars
01:10:55 to get my smithing level high enough
01:10:57 so that I can smith rune itor
01:10:59 into bars.
01:11:01 And that means something to somebody
01:11:03 and it certainly means something to me.
01:11:05 You're welcome, RuneScape
01:11:07 knowing audience.
01:11:11 Well, that sounds great.
01:11:13 You gotta do it.
01:11:15 You gotta rune it. Yeah.
01:11:17 I wanna do it.
01:11:19 Like runar or morse.
01:11:21 I always wanted to do it whenever
01:11:23 since I was a tiny little speck in the ground.
01:11:25 Since I was one atom tall.
01:11:27 Here's what I can say.
01:11:29 If I were you,
01:11:31 I'm sure I would feel the same way.
01:11:33 That's the most
01:11:35 condescending generic way I can agree
01:11:37 with someone.
01:11:39 So you're welcome for that.
01:11:41 Here's another image.
01:11:43 This is showing
01:11:45 in the chicken farm.
01:11:47 Somebody has been killing chickens
01:11:49 and getting the raw chicken so they could
01:11:51 make roast chicken. Lucky.
01:11:53 Ooh, that looks tasty.
01:11:55 Look at all the bones.
01:11:57 You can make some good
01:11:59 stock out of them bones.
01:12:01 There's some giant bones in those chicken.
01:12:03 Yes.
01:12:05 Full of femurs.
01:12:07 That bone goes from
01:12:09 it just replaces
01:12:11 its entire spine.
01:12:13 Everything drops bones
01:12:15 if you bury the bones
01:12:17 you get prayer experience
01:12:19 because you're giving it a proper
01:12:21 send off.
01:12:23 Prayer experience allows you to gain buffs
01:12:25 in combat or other things.
01:12:27 To protect you from magic
01:12:29 damage or melee damage
01:12:31 and things like that.
01:12:33 So if you kill
01:12:35 a million chickens, you may as well pick up
01:12:37 their bones and give each one a burial
01:12:39 and get prayer experience for it.
01:12:41 Cool.
01:12:43 That's what I do.
01:12:45 That's what I do with my time.
01:12:47 Chicken mass grave.
01:12:51 We can only do it one at a time.
01:12:53 They're all tiny little graves.
01:12:55 Do you get more prayer points
01:12:57 for a bigger creature
01:12:59 being buried? Literally yes.
01:13:01 If you get giant bones, if you kill giants
01:13:03 and you bury their bones, the mass
01:13:05 equates to more burial experience.
01:13:07 It's a bigger funeral. That means it's more
01:13:09 sacred.
01:13:11 If you get dragon bones, you bury those
01:13:13 as well as even more prayer experience.
01:13:15 Of course.
01:13:17 That's just how
01:13:19 religion works in real life as well.
01:13:21 God just likes
01:13:23 the amount of bones.
01:13:25 Bigger souls, please.
01:13:27 Yeah.
01:13:29 Good.
01:13:31 I agree.
01:13:33 I agree.
01:13:35 Runescape.
01:13:37 What's it called?
01:13:39 World of Warcraft Fantasy.
01:13:41 It's based on
01:13:43 Tolkien or something.
01:13:45 That's what I wanted to come on this episode.
01:13:47 That is why
01:13:49 you pitched yourself as coming on
01:13:51 because I talked to a Tolkien.
01:13:53 Yeah.
01:13:55 You said you're a Tolkien guy.
01:13:57 No. I saw that episode
01:13:59 titled two weeks ago. It was mid-journey
01:14:01 and Tolkien. I already expected it
01:14:03 to be like, you always do that thing
01:14:05 or I guess Elgazar does the thing where
01:14:07 you do something for like five minutes
01:14:09 out of three hours and that's in the title.
01:14:11 Look, blame Elgazar
01:14:13 for picking the titles.
01:14:15 That happened with Hollow Knight 2 once.
01:14:17 I was really excited. He had like a whole
01:14:19 Hollow Knight thumbnail and Hollow Knight in the title
01:14:21 and Gip mentioned her stream once.
01:14:23 I don't know what to tell Elgazar.
01:14:25 We don't tell Elgazar what to put
01:14:27 the title on. No, no, no. It's fine.
01:14:29 I mean, it's working. I guess it's working.
01:14:31 It's clickbait and it's just
01:14:33 bait and there's no content.
01:14:35 No, it's great. You've been duped.
01:14:37 It's perfect never paint bait.
01:14:39 Yeah, I guess. You're a sucker.
01:14:41 What the procrastinator is talking
01:14:43 about Tolkien? Like the one thing
01:14:45 I know about? Talking about them?
01:14:47 Incredible.
01:14:49 Wow. I don't really know.
01:14:51 No, I really don't know that much about it
01:14:53 other than I read the books
01:14:55 when I was in like
01:14:57 high school, middle school.
01:14:59 Yeah, I'm insane.
01:15:01 That was a long, long time ago
01:15:03 and I saw the movie.
01:15:05 I don't even think I saw all the movies.
01:15:07 I think I saw the first two movies.
01:15:09 And you know, everybody likes the movies
01:15:11 and I hated them.
01:15:13 I remember viewing
01:15:15 well, I remember viewing them with disdain.
01:15:17 I remember thinking that adaptations
01:15:19 were like cheap and not art
01:15:21 and that these movies are just a...
01:15:23 Yeah, I remember turning my nose up
01:15:25 and being like, ugh, they just remade the
01:15:27 book. Like, why?
01:15:29 The book is already good.
01:15:31 I know. And like, clearly
01:15:33 culture has...
01:15:35 I was not vindicated by time
01:15:37 on that one. But that was my take.
01:15:39 But that was my take back in the day.
01:15:41 So your problem wasn't that they
01:15:43 were too different from the books.
01:15:45 Your problem was that they were just the same thing
01:15:47 and it wasn't
01:15:49 creative enough.
01:15:51 That's interesting.
01:15:53 I was about to say that's a really hot take
01:15:55 but then I'm like, maybe not.
01:15:57 It's still...
01:15:59 It still is.
01:16:01 Because these movies are kind of like universally
01:16:03 praised
01:16:05 mostly for being like, oh, this is like the
01:16:07 ultimate adaptation. This is the best thing
01:16:09 you can do. This is
01:16:11 perfectly true to Talking Spirit
01:16:13 which is like not completely true.
01:16:15 But...
01:16:17 Yeah.
01:16:19 Look, when Aragorn punched
01:16:21 that guy and went slash
01:16:23 kill that orc
01:16:25 I enjoyed it.
01:16:27 Did you know that when Aragorn punched
01:16:29 that guy, he broke his toe?
01:16:31 No. It's when he kicks
01:16:33 the helmet. Yeah, I know.
01:16:35 Did you know that when he kicked the helmet
01:16:37 he deflected the blade?
01:16:39 Oh, wait.
01:16:41 The actual fact is that when Aragorn
01:16:43 kicks a helmet or an orc head
01:16:45 in the movie, he actually broke his toe
01:16:47 and they kept that take in and he screamed
01:16:49 and...
01:16:51 You screamed in character.
01:16:53 He screamed and just fell on his knees
01:16:55 and it was like, ah, so sad.
01:16:57 Doesn't Aragorn
01:16:59 kill the mouth of Sauron
01:17:01 in the movie that he doesn't in the book?
01:17:03 Yes, it's horrible in the movie.
01:17:05 It's only an extended edition, but...
01:17:07 And it's literally just him like killing a
01:17:09 peaceful ambassador. Yes, it's great, right?
01:17:11 Like, sure, he's from the evil empire
01:17:13 but like, they sent you this guy to negotiate.
01:17:15 Like, that's what the
01:17:17 fucking Trade Federation does
01:17:19 to the Jedi.
01:17:21 He's one of those fucking
01:17:23 Asian stereotype
01:17:25 lizard people.
01:17:27 He's as bad as fucking...
01:17:29 What's his name? Anakin.
01:17:31 Remlazar.
01:17:33 No.
01:17:35 Trade
01:17:37 Federation. We're talking about Tolkien.
01:17:39 I gotta look up what the aliens in Star Wars are.
01:17:41 Trade Federation.
01:17:43 Aliens.
01:17:45 Lexivarack?
01:17:47 I think. Is the...
01:17:49 The dudes?
01:17:51 That's not even a really constructed language.
01:17:53 Newt Gunwreck. That's the one.
01:17:55 Aragorn is just as bad as Newt Gunwreck.
01:17:57 Okay.
01:17:59 I don't remember this
01:18:01 from the film.
01:18:03 What are you talking about?
01:18:05 What is the mouth of Sauron?
01:18:07 At the black gate in the end of the third movie.
01:18:09 Only an extended edition.
01:18:11 There's a guy coming out with an ugly face.
01:18:13 I haven't seen the extended editions, so that makes sense.
01:18:15 They're pretty good, except that scene.
01:18:17 I don't know the scene where they jump over.
01:18:19 I remember seeing the mouth of Sauron
01:18:21 and thinking that he looked very striking.
01:18:23 I mean, I thought he looked cool.
01:18:25 I mean, the artisan of these movies.
01:18:27 These movies are incredible in general.
01:18:29 That's the best thing about them.
01:18:31 And the music.
01:18:33 I learned from Tolkien Untangled
01:18:35 that the mouth of Sauron is...
01:18:37 What is he?
01:18:39 He is a black Numenorean.
01:18:41 Exactly.
01:18:43 And now I didn't know that.
01:18:45 He's a dude who works for Sauron
01:18:47 for some reason.
01:18:49 We don't know a lot about him.
01:18:51 But there must be more of them.
01:18:53 But there are others, too.
01:18:55 He's not the only one.
01:18:57 We don't even know if the mouth of Sauron
01:18:59 is one character or just a title.
01:19:01 Like...
01:19:03 That guy. I thought that was the Witch King.
01:19:05 No, Witch King.
01:19:07 It's like a hollow Nazgul dude.
01:19:09 Witch King is a race.
01:19:11 There's a Tolkien Untangled
01:19:13 Black Numenorean who's like a woman
01:19:15 who is like this witch
01:19:17 that has these black cats
01:19:19 and her cats are like her spies.
01:19:21 And she...
01:19:23 That's Queen Baruthiel.
01:19:25 But we don't...
01:19:27 I don't actually know...
01:19:29 I don't actually know that she's a Black Numenorean.
01:19:31 I don't think we know a lot about her.
01:19:33 I think that...
01:19:35 He said she was a Black Numenorean.
01:19:37 That might be it.
01:19:39 You don't have to take it up with him.
01:19:41 I'm not even familiar with Queen Baruthiel.
01:19:43 Queen Baruthiel is one of these things.
01:19:45 It's just a name drop in the Lord of Rings book.
01:19:47 Like Aragorn says something.
01:19:49 To walk from Moria, we need eyes
01:19:51 as good as the cats of Queen Baruthiel.
01:19:53 And...
01:19:55 Talking himself didn't know who Queen Baruthiel was
01:19:57 when he wrote that probably.
01:19:59 That's why he was...
01:20:01 That's why he was writing mostly.
01:20:03 And then maybe he came up with
01:20:05 Queen Baruthiel.
01:20:07 He would brighten it in the
01:20:09 unfinished tales.
01:20:11 He's like, oh yeah, she's like a witch
01:20:13 with these cats that she communes with.
01:20:15 And she sailed on a boat somewhere.
01:20:17 Or something.
01:20:19 I don't know.
01:20:21 God, I love talking.
01:20:23 It's been my mainstay.
01:20:25 Just like George Lucas.
01:20:27 The music they listen to
01:20:29 in the cantina is called
01:20:31 Jizz.
01:20:33 What else?
01:20:35 You seen that
01:20:37 Tuesday
01:20:39 JK Rowling versus
01:20:41 George Lucas?
01:20:43 I haven't actually.
01:20:45 Hold on, I'll post it.
01:20:47 It's about retconning things.
01:20:49 It's the two of them.
01:20:51 The stupid dumb shit they come up with
01:20:53 about their stories after the fact.
01:20:55 Hang on.
01:20:57 We need Tuesday
01:20:59 JK Rowling
01:21:01 George
01:21:03 How do you spell George?
01:21:05 Geodude
01:21:07 Like any other George.
01:21:09 Here we go.
01:21:11 Here we go.
01:21:13 It's in two images.
01:21:15 You're going to have to look at both of them.
01:21:17 Sorry, I brought this topic up.
01:21:19 We have to discuss it thoroughly.
01:21:21 We have to
01:21:23 dissect every morsel
01:21:25 of content
01:21:27 out of this.
01:21:29 The thing is, is that all
01:21:31 actually George Lucas
01:21:33 because the extended Star Wars
01:21:35 was like all different authors doing stuff
01:21:37 and George Lucas just waving it
01:21:39 and be like, yeah, it's okay.
01:21:41 I don't think these are real.
01:21:43 I don't think there is an actually
01:21:45 I don't think Qui-Gon Jinn's hairdresser
01:21:47 is actually a blue rat named Fungo
01:21:49 hairstyle.
01:21:51 I can believe that.
01:21:53 But all the
01:21:55 Star Wars shit, all the novels
01:21:57 are written by different people
01:21:59 and
01:22:01 back in the day before Disney took over
01:22:03 George Lucas was just like, yeah, sure, it's all canon.
01:22:05 I don't care.
01:22:07 Let's just probably make it canon.
01:22:09 You might be right.
01:22:11 I mean, I think George does say
01:22:13 goofy shit like this, but yeah.
01:22:15 Some of the goofy shit is probably
01:22:17 from like the extended books
01:22:19 that other people wrote. That's fair.
01:22:21 All of the things J.K. Rowling
01:22:23 is depicted saying here are exactly
01:22:25 one-to-one. She said them
01:22:27 for sure, definitely.
01:22:29 I hope so.
01:22:31 There are no Jews at Hogwarts, but don't worry.
01:22:33 All the main characters are about
01:22:35 Zion.
01:22:39 But they talk about it off-screen
01:22:41 all the time. They're always
01:22:43 really mad at Palestinian terrorists.
01:22:45 They're getting fucking fuming.
01:22:47 They can't even
01:22:49 they can't even fight against
01:22:51 the master red corner J.R.
01:22:53 Tolkien who's literally the best
01:22:55 red corner in the world
01:22:57 and also it's like
01:22:59 kind of one of the coolest
01:23:01 things about his work.
01:23:05 Well, okay. Do you know how
01:23:07 in the Hobbit Bilbo gets the ring at first?
01:23:13 Basically, he walks into a cave
01:23:15 he finds the ring just on the ground
01:23:17 doesn't think much of it. Then he meets
01:23:19 then he meets Gollum
01:23:21 and has like that riddle
01:23:23 game with him.
01:23:25 You know, yeah, I forget the details
01:23:27 but I think I've heard
01:23:29 he stumbles upon.
01:23:31 He stumbles upon the ring
01:23:33 and finds Gollum
01:23:35 Gollum wants to eat him and they make
01:23:37 like a bet. Hey, let's do a riddle game
01:23:39 and if I win
01:23:41 you have to, Bilbo says if I win
01:23:43 you have to show me the way out. If Gollum wins
01:23:45 Gollum eats him and
01:23:47 Gollum had this ring but lost
01:23:49 it earlier and Bilbo found it
01:23:51 didn't tell Gollum.
01:23:53 Towards the end, Bilbo runs out of riddles
01:23:55 says like a fake riddle
01:23:57 what do you have in my pocket
01:23:59 and Gollum has to guess exactly
01:24:01 the ring and
01:24:03 then Bilbo in the end just runs away
01:24:05 from Gollum and
01:24:07 yeah, basically
01:24:09 he got this ring
01:24:11 kind of dishonestly and like in not a
01:24:13 very cool or honorable way
01:24:15 but that's not actually the original
01:24:17 version of the story because
01:24:19 in like the 1937
01:24:21 version of the Hobbit that got first published
01:24:23 that story was completely
01:24:25 different and that story
01:24:27 he met Gollum and Gollum was
01:24:29 much more friendly and goofier character
01:24:31 and he actually
01:24:33 bet the ring in the riddle game
01:24:35 like Gollum was like hey if you
01:24:37 win this riddle game you can get the ring
01:24:39 and Bilbo won the game
01:24:41 won the ring
01:24:43 honorably and they said goodbye
01:24:45 and Gollum showed them the way out I think
01:24:47 even. I'm not entirely sure
01:24:49 but then
01:24:51 that wouldn't make sense with what the ring
01:24:53 ended up becoming. Yes, exactly
01:24:55 then the publishers came and were like
01:24:57 okay, JR
01:24:59 talking we want more
01:25:01 Hobbit stories and he was like
01:25:03 can you publish my silver ring?
01:25:05 They were like no
01:25:07 it doesn't have Hobbits in it
01:25:09 that's weird stuff
01:25:11 give us Hobbits and he was like okay
01:25:13 I guess I can write the Hobbit too
01:25:15 and then he took like 15 years to write
01:25:17 and while he was writing that
01:25:19 and turned out that the ring might be
01:25:21 actually way more important than he thought
01:25:23 because Tolkien didn't plan out it
01:25:25 he just wrote and explored
01:25:27 the world as he was writing
01:25:29 and
01:25:31 so while that was happening
01:25:33 he was like okay this is too important
01:25:35 the ring is too important. Let's
01:25:37 republish the Hobbit
01:25:39 change that story but
01:25:41 the original story in the original
01:25:43 published version is still in the book
01:25:45 the story that Bilbo tells to the other dwarves
01:25:47 when he meets up with him again
01:25:49 so he justifies
01:25:51 to the dwarves
01:25:53 that yeah that's how I got the ring
01:25:55 it was all
01:25:57 he also says it to Gandalf I believe
01:25:59 and it was all honorable
01:26:01 so now it's not just that he got the ring
01:26:03 dishonorably but he lied about it
01:26:05 he lied about it and that's the original
01:26:07 story that went into Bilbo's diary
01:26:09 which became the published Hobbit
01:26:11 and so most of the Hobbits
01:26:13 are back again because it's framed as
01:26:15 this is the record that Bilbo wrote down
01:26:17 of what happened
01:26:19 so most of the Hobbits
01:26:21 in the Shire at the beginning for Lord of the Rings
01:26:23 have heard Bilbo's stories
01:26:25 from that book
01:26:27 but they've heard the fake story
01:26:29 from the 1937 Hobbit
01:26:31 so it's that
01:26:33 both versions are canon in the story
01:26:35 that rules so much
01:26:37 and basically only I think Frodo
01:26:39 and Sam and Gandalf
01:26:41 know the real version of the story
01:26:43 and it's so thematically fitting
01:26:45 because Bilbo
01:26:47 only hours after finding that ring
01:26:49 felt the need to lie about how he got it
01:26:51 like he felt the need to justify
01:26:53 his ownership of the ring
01:26:55 it's already influencing him
01:26:57 there was no real reason
01:27:01 that's a clever retcon
01:27:03 that actually works with how
01:27:05 he intended to use the ring going forward
01:27:07 that's really cool
01:27:09 and there's so much like that
01:27:11 he kind of
01:27:13 I mean all of the Legendarium
01:27:15 all of the Lord of the Rings
01:27:17 Hobbits and everything and stuff
01:27:19 all is kind of
01:27:21 there's multiple versions of it
01:27:23 and it's all kind of canon
01:27:25 or canon is not even important
01:27:27 because it's all told stories
01:27:29 and written down manuscripts
01:27:31 from people in the story
01:27:33 that got translated many times
01:27:35 and given to different people
01:27:37 it's kind of beautiful
01:27:39 I love it for that
01:27:41 so like the story
01:27:43 canonically is written
01:27:45 or finished by Frodo
01:27:47 the Lord of the Rings
01:27:49 but Frodo wasn't
01:27:51 at every event
01:27:53 so he had to hear it from
01:27:55 from everyone else
01:27:57 I'm pretty sure the final version
01:27:59 that Tolkien came up with
01:28:01 is that the Lord of the Rings
01:28:03 and the Hobbit are Bilbo's diary
01:28:05 Frodo's
01:28:07 reports of the events
01:28:09 of Lord of the Rings
01:28:11 combined with
01:28:13 I think after
01:28:15 Frodo gave the book to Sam
01:28:17 when he left to the Grey Havens
01:28:19 and Sam completed it and I think Sam's family too
01:28:21 and then the book was given to Minas Tirith
01:28:23 to Gondor
01:28:25 where like historians
01:28:27 kind of added annotations
01:28:29 and changed a few things
01:28:31 and like added some
01:28:33 information where it was needed
01:28:35 and so on
01:28:37 and it got like stored there
01:28:39 and retranslated in other parts
01:28:41 until I believe
01:28:43 in one version of the Legendarium
01:28:45 there's actually like an Anglo-Saxon
01:28:47 human person from the real world
01:28:49 finding that manuscript
01:28:51 and transcribing it into
01:28:53 old English
01:28:55 and Tolkien pretended to be
01:28:57 the final translator to translate it
01:28:59 into modern English
01:29:01 that's commitment
01:29:03 it's all really fucking neat
01:29:05 that commitment to the bit
01:29:07 that is great because it's like
01:29:09 from fantasy
01:29:11 fantasy
01:29:13 is like stories from history
01:29:15 that were passed down by word of mouth
01:29:17 and then written down and translated over
01:29:19 years and they become myths
01:29:21 and he made his own myths
01:29:23 and then came up with a canonical reason
01:29:25 why magic exists then
01:29:27 but doesn't in the real world
01:29:29 because it's like
01:29:31 it's a story
01:29:33 it's like was there
01:29:35 Sauron, huh? What?
01:29:37 Could it have been just a guy with a big axe?
01:29:39 I mean
01:29:41 sorry if this is a
01:29:43 shit everybody knows already
01:29:45 but are you all familiar
01:29:47 with
01:29:49 oh god
01:29:51 The Princess Bride
01:29:53 No
01:29:55 I also don't
01:29:57 Okay, well
01:29:59 Aasha have you read the book or have you seen the movie?
01:30:01 I've seen the movie only
01:30:03 I haven't read the book, I've read parts of it
01:30:05 The movie
01:30:07 is framed
01:30:09 as
01:30:11 the
01:30:13 grandpa is
01:30:15 reading the story
01:30:17 to his grandkid
01:30:19 and it's sort of every now and then
01:30:21 it jumps out of the story to have a conversation
01:30:23 between the grandpa and the kid
01:30:25 and the grandpa is like
01:30:27 nah, let's skip past this part
01:30:29 nah, this part's boring
01:30:31 nah, you don't want to hear the romance stuff
01:30:33 or whatever
01:30:35 Well, the book
01:30:37 which is much less famous than the movie
01:30:39 is sort of like that
01:30:41 the book is written
01:30:43 as like an edited manuscript
01:30:45 of another fantasy
01:30:47 sorry, it's written where there's
01:30:49 notes in red ink
01:30:51 written by the quote unquote editor
01:30:53 this part went on
01:30:55 for pages and pages describing
01:30:57 the lineage of this
01:30:59 and nobody cares, so I cut it out
01:31:01 like a fake
01:31:03 meta
01:31:05 the author wrote it
01:31:07 with these fake editors
01:31:09 notes about how I cut this part out because it sucks
01:31:11 I
01:31:13 haven't read the whole book, but I've seen it
01:31:15 and it's got a similar
01:31:17 meta
01:31:19 framing device to it
01:31:21 I mean, Tolkien's
01:31:23 not many people have read the
01:31:25 not many people have read the book
01:31:27 I think a lot of people don't even know that it is based on a book
01:31:29 sounds good though
01:31:31 yeah
01:31:33 I mean, Tolkien's original intention
01:31:35 was to some extent to
01:31:37 create a mythology for England
01:31:39 because he felt like England doesn't have
01:31:41 its own fairy tales or myths
01:31:43 that just belong
01:31:45 to England because of its history
01:31:47 of the nomadic invasion
01:31:49 and
01:31:51 a bunch of stuff going on
01:31:53 I don't know the history facts well enough
01:31:55 yeah, I mean we were just like a bunch of peasants
01:31:57 sitting in mud
01:31:59 and flooring mud around
01:32:01 and then we got invaded like 18 times
01:32:03 I guess we have culture now
01:32:05 I mean, English got kind of banned
01:32:07 for a while and then mixed with French
01:32:09 and
01:32:11 a lot going on
01:32:13 but over time
01:32:15 I guess we're Anglicans
01:32:17 now over time he kind of went into the direction
01:32:19 yeah, I'm just going to
01:32:21 have my own
01:32:23 sub-creation
01:32:25 he wants his own
01:32:27 what we do now all the time
01:32:29 it's so fun but he was like
01:32:31 this is my own thing
01:32:33 and it's not directly based on our history
01:32:35 or whatever
01:32:37 it's not super supposed to be our world
01:32:39 but our world on a different
01:32:41 imaginary
01:32:43 stage or layer
01:32:45 and
01:32:47 it's
01:32:49 really cool
01:32:51 of course
01:32:53 he commented once
01:32:55 that whole thing that he wanted to be
01:32:57 a mythology for England
01:32:59 and that means that when you make an adaptation now
01:33:01 you can't possibly cast
01:33:03 BPUC actors in it
01:33:05 because all the fans would come and say
01:33:07 no this is a mythology for England
01:33:09 you can't do that
01:33:11 you can't do
01:33:13 black fish and chips
01:33:17 black people in England
01:33:19 can't be happening
01:33:21 it's not true
01:33:23 no
01:33:25 thank you
01:33:27 so brave of you to say it
01:33:29 so brave of you to say it and risk cancelling
01:33:31 no I'm parroting
01:33:33 a lot of stupid people I've heard
01:33:35 over the past few months
01:33:37 there's a tv series
01:33:39 being made right?
01:33:41 or is that also a Game of Thrones one
01:33:43 being made?
01:33:45 there's apparently
01:33:47 several sort of perspective
01:33:49 Game of Thrones side stories
01:33:51 series that are like in production right now
01:33:53 that dude should just finish his book
01:33:55 what damn it
01:33:57 but he's like
01:33:59 involved in all of them a little bit I think
01:34:01 he's involved in all of them
01:34:03 and
01:34:05 also he seems to be
01:34:07 like he's
01:34:09 according to his updates it seems like he's
01:34:11 yeah
01:34:13 his updates seem to suggest that he's more
01:34:15 focused on the tv shows
01:34:17 finishing
01:34:19 it's a classic like I'm gonna start a bunch of new
01:34:21 projects because I want to procrastinate
01:34:23 really hard on this one that I have to do
01:34:25 and I know I have to do it
01:34:27 I mean
01:34:29 what if I did anything else
01:34:31 what if I did a writing game
01:34:33 I mean song of ice and fire
01:34:35 we should get George R. R. Martin
01:34:37 from the podcast
01:34:39 yes Ben have you seen that
01:34:41 so that he doesn't have to write his book
01:34:43 have you seen a Preston Jacobs video where he like
01:34:45 figures out how much he has written
01:34:47 since
01:34:49 that was really depressing
01:34:51 I'm glad you're a Preston head
01:34:53 I am
01:34:55 I don't
01:34:57 he
01:34:59 he's a Game of Thrones guy
01:35:01 he is kind of known in community
01:35:03 as a little bit of like tinfoil
01:35:05 because he has really advanced
01:35:07 crazy theories
01:35:09 all kind of make sense though
01:35:11 the man is a misunderstood
01:35:13 genius
01:35:15 the man knows George better than George
01:35:17 knows himself
01:35:19 maybe we'll see
01:35:21 history will vindicate you Preston
01:35:23 no history won't because
01:35:25 the books are never gonna get done
01:35:27 we'll never know
01:35:29 we'll never know if Quentin survived
01:35:31 oh god
01:35:33 true
01:35:35 but he made a video
01:35:37 he made a video where he basically went back
01:35:39 through like everything George
01:35:41 has ever said on the subject
01:35:43 and like pretty much constructed
01:35:45 a theory of like okay based on
01:35:47 everything George has said how much do we think
01:35:49 he's actually written and the answer
01:35:51 is like some
01:35:53 but like maybe like a quarter
01:35:55 of a book now the worst thing is that
01:35:57 he kind of figured out that George has
01:35:59 probably written anything for like the first
01:36:01 like eight years
01:36:03 after the last book
01:36:05 because he wrote too much for the
01:36:07 last book he had like a few chapters
01:36:09 left over and so
01:36:11 like he could kind of just
01:36:13 said yeah I have so this much done of the new
01:36:15 book but he could have just referred to the old chapters
01:36:17 that he already had done
01:36:19 from the beginning and
01:36:21 he probably hasn't really started writing
01:36:23 anything new until like two years ago
01:36:27 oh boy yeah
01:36:29 and he's well
01:36:31 busy
01:36:33 yeah and he also said that he doesn't
01:36:35 want anyone else to finish it
01:36:37 when he's dead so
01:36:39 I wonder how's that gonna work out
01:36:43 come on just let
01:36:45 someone else finish it
01:36:47 come on you're gonna be dead
01:36:49 someday
01:36:51 who cares
01:36:53 who cares at that point
01:36:55 Preston tries to finish it right now
01:36:57 I want to on the subject
01:36:59 of black characters
01:37:01 in Tolkien I did see
01:37:03 that one dwarf
01:37:05 and I was enraged
01:37:07 she's barely got a beard
01:37:09 it's bullshit
01:37:11 it's bullshit the story
01:37:13 clearly says that female
01:37:15 dwarves have beards just like the men
01:37:17 and non dwarves can't tell them apart
01:37:19 and then they get the oh they get
01:37:21 oh here's a girl dwarf
01:37:23 and she's got oh she's got these delicate
01:37:25 little sideburns oh these cute little sideburns
01:37:27 she's got a beard guys no
01:37:29 no that's not what it's
01:37:31 that's not textual
01:37:33 you cowards
01:37:35 okay the thing is
01:37:37 the thing is
01:37:39 it's kind of debatable
01:37:41 if that's actually in the books because
01:37:43 of the nature of how Tolkien's
01:37:45 writing works
01:37:47 there is a book where he says that
01:37:49 all dwarves, male and female
01:37:51 get born with beards
01:37:53 and that's fine there's also stuff like
01:37:55 oh dwarves never get their beards cut off
01:37:57 because that's like really
01:37:59 shameful for them so they don't shave or whatever
01:38:01 the thing is
01:38:03 yeah that's in one of the thing that's like
01:38:05 somewhere published in History of Middle Earth
01:38:07 so not even in any of the main
01:38:09 big publications
01:38:11 in the Lord of the Rings
01:38:13 it just says that
01:38:15 dwarf men and women are like
01:38:17 close in appearance
01:38:19 not specifying more
01:38:21 and there's also different
01:38:23 older writings where
01:38:25 he says that's another retcon by the way
01:38:27 do you know how Gimli in the movie says
01:38:29 oh there's like a legend that
01:38:31 a dwarf and women get born
01:38:33 oh no like dwarves just get born
01:38:35 out of stone we don't even have women
01:38:37 that's actually something that Tolkien
01:38:39 wrote in an earlier version of the same
01:38:41 universe
01:38:43 back in the day dwarves were just like
01:38:45 constructed stone beings that were also
01:38:47 I mean that's how they were originally
01:38:49 made by
01:38:51 what the fuck is that
01:38:53 yes Aula made
01:38:55 them out of stone
01:38:57 the first dwarves
01:38:59 yeah the seven dwarf fathers
01:39:01 we don't even know if there were any women
01:39:03 where did the first ones come from
01:39:05 it's all a little unclear
01:39:07 yeah exactly
01:39:09 I think Tolkien hated
01:39:11 Snow White the Disney movie
01:39:13 a lot and his daughter really loved it
01:39:15 and
01:39:17 he had a big problem with that
01:39:19 but yeah and that's a thing
01:39:21 there's like multiple versions of that
01:39:23 I think in a Tolkien book that
01:39:25 just came out this year or last year
01:39:27 by the way
01:39:29 there's new Tolkien books coming out every year
01:39:31 because there's so much writing to it that still gets
01:39:33 published there's still not done
01:39:35 from his like from his
01:39:37 like old like journals and stuff
01:39:39 yeah yeah there's still
01:39:41 material there's a new Tolkien book coming out
01:39:43 this year called the fall of Númenor
01:39:45 which will have
01:39:47 more original text probably
01:39:49 that haven't been published
01:39:51 there's so much
01:39:53 but yeah and in that
01:39:55 new book it specifically states
01:39:57 all male
01:39:59 capitalized dwarves have beers
01:40:01 and that's one of his latest writings so
01:40:03 it seems like he changed his mind a few times
01:40:07 but in general I agree
01:40:09 with you I think it's cool
01:40:11 I just want to be mad
01:40:13 that's what the internet is for
01:40:15 listen
01:40:17 obviously I'm actually just mad
01:40:19 that she's black but I can't say that
01:40:21 so I have to pretend that it's about the beers
01:40:23 okay?
01:40:25 let me have it
01:40:27 yeah that's the point actually
01:40:29 I actually also would like to see
01:40:31 dwarven women of beards
01:40:33 that would be great and
01:40:35 yeah I agree
01:40:37 even if there's a textual
01:40:39 reasoning for it I still think it would have been cooler
01:40:41 if she just had a beer
01:40:43 they could still make
01:40:45 they could still give her feminine features
01:40:47 they could give eyelashes or whatever
01:40:49 they did add a bit in the Hobbit movies
01:40:51 there's a few background dwarven women
01:40:53 that have bigger sideburns
01:40:55 at least and a little bit of chin and beard
01:40:57 but
01:40:59 it really doesn't make sense why beards
01:41:01 are a thing anyway
01:41:03 why doesn't hair come out of the
01:41:05 chin on some people and not on others
01:41:07 why the hormones is that
01:41:09 is that why?
01:41:11 what's the purpose of this?
01:41:13 I don't get humans they don't make sense
01:41:15 keep your chin warm
01:41:17 women need their chin warm
01:41:19 everyone not likes a warm chin
01:41:21 no they don't
01:41:23 women should be cold all the time
01:41:25 and God said
01:41:27 you know
01:41:29 when Eve ate the apple
01:41:31 God said women will always be cold
01:41:33 in the office the AC will always be
01:41:35 turned up a little too high and they'll complain
01:41:37 about it forever
01:41:39 and so it was
01:41:41 on earth as it was in heaven
01:41:43 I read the bible
01:41:45 makes sense
01:41:47 it's the only mythology for england that I need
01:41:49 there's a weird thing going on with the new tv show
01:41:51 that
01:41:53 they casted a few B.P.C. actors
01:41:55 for it
01:41:57 and that's
01:41:59 one of them was an elf
01:42:01 that's probably the most debated one
01:42:03 but
01:42:05 I just read it don't care
01:42:07 I think middle earth is big enough that it's possible
01:42:09 and
01:42:11 I mean there's like
01:42:13 I've been watching this guy's videos
01:42:15 and I know there's a bunch of different elf
01:42:17 tribes
01:42:19 there's a lot of different elf groups
01:42:21 I don't think I can list them all off
01:42:23 they have many different names as well
01:42:25 there's like way more regions
01:42:27 in middle earth than
01:42:29 just the ones that you hear about
01:42:31 in lord of the rings
01:42:33 it's all underwater
01:42:35 there's a ballerian
01:42:37 and numinor
01:42:39 ballerian is bigger than middle earth
01:42:41 that we see in lord of the rings
01:42:43 and it's all underwater and gone
01:42:45 numinor as well
01:42:47 wow middle earth is a planet
01:42:49 well
01:42:51 wait no middle earth is
01:42:53 the plate
01:42:55 middle earth is like the land
01:42:57 the planet is called
01:42:59 I forget what the world is called
01:43:01 I got it
01:43:03 I think outer actually
01:43:05 includes all creation
01:43:07 including space
01:43:09 and everything around it
01:43:11 I see
01:43:13 but middle earth is like
01:43:15 the land in the middle
01:43:17 and it used to be actually a flat earth
01:43:19 and then turned round at some point
01:43:21 wait what did I want to get to
01:43:23 oh yeah
01:43:25 the elf of color
01:43:27 oh yeah
01:43:29 the EOC
01:43:31 yeah exactly
01:43:33 the thing is melanin
01:43:35 like doesn't even
01:43:37 it's not even a thing
01:43:39 I mean the thing is
01:43:41 what do you mean
01:43:43 middle earth is not based on science in most ways
01:43:45 the most scientific thing about middle earth
01:43:47 is like the language development
01:43:49 that's like because Tolkien knew
01:43:51 a lot about that and he made sure
01:43:53 that that's all correct and actually
01:43:55 really detailed
01:43:57 the sun of middle earth is not our sun
01:43:59 it's like a magical glowing
01:44:01 fruit from
01:44:03 one of the two trees that lit the world
01:44:05 before sun and moon existed
01:44:07 and it's like a magical glowing
01:44:09 fruit that gets carried by an angelic being
01:44:11 over the planet
01:44:13 and then like under the
01:44:15 I guess under the flat earth plate
01:44:17 and then on the other side up again
01:44:19 and the sun has kind of like
01:44:21 a relationship with the moon
01:44:23 and that's why the moon always wants to get closer to the sun
01:44:25 is also being that's carrying a magic
01:44:27 flower or something
01:44:29 and like that's why he has like
01:44:31 stains because he gets too close to the sun or something
01:44:33 like
01:44:35 and elves got kind of
01:44:37 made before sun even existed
01:44:39 like they should be all albinos
01:44:41 I guess
01:44:43 but like middle of biology doesn't
01:44:45 make any sense there's no real reason
01:44:47 why specific people should have
01:44:49 specific skin colors
01:44:51 it's all fair game really
01:44:53 I mean in earth
01:44:55 different peoples
01:44:57 living in different places
01:44:59 developed different physical
01:45:01 attributes so why not
01:45:03 elves why not
01:45:05 dwarves etc
01:45:07 oh god there was a
01:45:09 I was watching a Trey the explainer
01:45:11 video you ever see that guy
01:45:13 I was watching one
01:45:15 it was about the um I think
01:45:17 I hope I'm remembering they're called the Ainu
01:45:19 the indigenous people of Japan
01:45:21 right for saying that I thought you meant
01:45:23 the Ainu or as in like all the
01:45:25 Valar and the Maya but yeah
01:45:27 no no no the Ainu
01:45:29 are this um this indigenous
01:45:31 tribe
01:45:33 or something that was there in Japan
01:45:35 before you know what we think
01:45:37 of as the ethnically Japanese
01:45:39 colonized it more or less
01:45:41 and the
01:45:43 he was going into like um
01:45:45 oh god I forget the terms but like
01:45:47 the gene
01:45:49 like groups right like you can
01:45:51 you can track um
01:45:53 like gene groupings right like
01:45:55 different ethnic groups sometimes
01:45:57 share these like
01:45:59 gene packets
01:46:01 and by like oh this
01:46:03 these people have these gene these people
01:46:05 they look different but they have
01:46:07 they share this gene packet so we can see like
01:46:09 okay well they must share a common ancestor
01:46:11 they they these two groups must
01:46:13 have somehow been like a split in
01:46:15 this other third group that came from a third place
01:46:17 and it's like you might not think they were the same
01:46:19 but they actually share a relation and you can
01:46:21 tell by looking at you know these
01:46:23 these gene clusters and uh
01:46:25 the frickin these
01:46:27 these Ainu like they're not
01:46:29 uh they they have
01:46:31 curly they're they're
01:46:33 light skinned like
01:46:35 lighter than than Japanese like they have
01:46:37 like Caucasian like white skin
01:46:39 they have curly dark hair
01:46:41 and blue eyes
01:46:43 uh and yet they share
01:46:45 genes
01:46:47 like they're most closely related
01:46:49 to um this like
01:46:51 dark skinned
01:46:53 uh people that live like exclusively
01:46:55 on like the coast of like
01:46:57 the Indian Ocean or so they're like one little
01:46:59 place they don't look anything
01:47:01 alike but they have like a remark they
01:47:03 share these these gene packets
01:47:05 and like the only two groups that do so
01:47:07 so even in the real world
01:47:09 it doesn't always make sense obviously
01:47:11 the video the video showed
01:47:13 like oh god I wish I had
01:47:15 the diagram but it was like
01:47:17 it was like basically a sort
01:47:19 of like a flow chart of like
01:47:21 you know human genetic
01:47:23 uh like ethnic groups that had like
01:47:25 split and split and split and split and
01:47:27 split and like it's
01:47:29 it's totally like it's way
01:47:31 more complicated there's so many
01:47:33 more branches than I could even
01:47:35 think of and some of them yeah and
01:47:37 some of them split in ways like that like like these
01:47:39 two different groups that ended up looking
01:47:41 totally different but they are kind
01:47:43 of related to each other
01:47:45 like more closely than than
01:47:47 some others uh that even ones
01:47:49 that like look similar so
01:47:51 yeah this kind of thing
01:47:53 is just a thing that like
01:47:55 humans and human
01:47:57 adjacent creatures can be
01:47:59 like expected to do over
01:48:01 you know but uh
01:48:03 over you know geological
01:48:05 periods of time
01:48:07 differentiate themselves
01:48:09 physically right
01:48:11 yeah but don't you know that there's
01:48:13 only white people in Europe
01:48:15 like of course
01:48:17 everything I just everything I just
01:48:19 everything I just said was a test and you pass
01:48:21 I'm just
01:48:23 I'm just gonna disappear now
01:48:25 whew
01:48:27 whew
01:48:29 like that's the wind
01:48:31 the second I hit Europe
01:48:33 ground dude it's
01:48:35 it's crazy how much the outrage
01:48:37 against this casting and the Sean
01:48:39 general has been
01:48:41 very weird for me to
01:48:43 witness because
01:48:45 like Tolkien hasn't really
01:48:47 been that relevant for
01:48:49 a while like ever since the Hobbit movies
01:48:51 came out like for some reason
01:48:53 companies didn't touch it that much
01:48:55 like there were no
01:48:57 like there was no big sequel
01:48:59 series that will accept the Hobbit movies
01:49:01 really well I feel like video games and stuff
01:49:03 but it was very quiet yeah
01:49:05 I feel like the rights must have been
01:49:07 really expensive at that point
01:49:09 oh it's the most expensive TV show of all time
01:49:11 because of that
01:49:13 really yeah apparently they
01:49:15 I don't know how well the Hobbit movies did
01:49:17 the Hobbit movies did
01:49:19 obviously had the brand recognition
01:49:21 to get a lot of money but like
01:49:23 I don't think people liked them
01:49:25 critically I think they're kind of disliked
01:49:27 yeah in general
01:49:29 they're kind of forgettable
01:49:31 the last two especially the first one's
01:49:33 really good
01:49:35 but
01:49:37 yeah and so I haven't really
01:49:39 seen like the internet
01:49:41 the very bad
01:49:43 racist gamer internet
01:49:45 fandom descend onto my
01:49:47 fandom
01:49:49 as like happened to Star Wars
01:49:51 or whatever when they cast like
01:49:53 a black stormtrooper
01:49:55 a few years ago like I saw that
01:49:57 in Star Wars and I was like oh yeah my talking fandom
01:49:59 that's like everyone's nice
01:50:01 everyone's good but then they all came
01:50:03 we're not like those
01:50:05 we're not like those toxic Star Wars
01:50:07 yeah it turns out we actually are
01:50:09 I mean they are
01:50:11 it's there's
01:50:13 there's a lot of really horrible
01:50:15 YouTubers who
01:50:17 like promote that stuff
01:50:19 it's I mean
01:50:21 some YouTubers will
01:50:23 don't even really give a fuck
01:50:25 they'll swoop in
01:50:27 to any
01:50:29 subject if there's a
01:50:31 if there's an SJW
01:50:33 if there's an SJW to be owned
01:50:35 yeah I mean
01:50:37 the Lord of the Rings
01:50:39 is not like
01:50:41 there's a niche of like
01:50:43 super nerds who read the entire
01:50:45 Silmarillion but then there's like
01:50:47 the vast majority of people
01:50:49 who know what the Lord of the Rings is are just people
01:50:51 who grew up and
01:50:53 saw the movies with when they were out
01:50:55 or relevant and they're like
01:50:57 oh yeah
01:50:59 killing orcs
01:51:01 do you remember when Legolas killed
01:51:03 that big elephant all by himself
01:51:05 like that's the sort of people
01:51:07 who could forget
01:51:09 who could easily slot into like
01:51:11 a random like gamer racist
01:51:13 stereotype later in life
01:51:15 and they would just be like
01:51:17 I can't believe that my favorite
01:51:19 show where they kill elephants
01:51:21 with one elf has
01:51:23 black people in it now
01:51:25 I can't believe it
01:51:27 it's problematic because
01:51:29 I like elephants and it's
01:51:31 bad that they died in that war
01:51:33 leave them out of leave the elephants out of it
01:51:35 I can't believe that
01:51:37 I know exactly what they're gonna do in this show
01:51:39 they're gonna have a black elf and they're gonna kill two elephants
01:51:41 that's just unrealistic
01:51:43 they can't kill two elephants
01:51:45 the white elf has to kill more elephants
01:51:47 has to kill
01:51:49 kill cow
01:51:51 that's just more realistic
01:51:53 I think so
01:51:55 and talking is all about realism as you know
01:51:57 that's right
01:51:59 there's also
01:52:01 a bunch of critique from the other side
01:52:03 just because of like
01:52:05 for example the beard thing with the dwarven lady
01:52:07 who
01:52:09 and also the haircuts in general
01:52:11 are a little odd of the characters
01:52:13 like for example that black elf has
01:52:15 like very short
01:52:17 like
01:52:19 super short cut hair
01:52:21 and a bunch of other
01:52:23 a bunch of other male elves also have short hair
01:52:25 so it kind of seems like
01:52:27 they're trying to make them
01:52:29 like more masculine in general
01:52:31 even though they were kind of like
01:52:33 transcending that in the Peter Jackson movies
01:52:35 there's nothing
01:52:37 there's no real textural basis
01:52:39 I think a black elf would look pretty cool with like dreads
01:52:41 yeah
01:52:43 like long dreads in a big like
01:52:45 you know tail or whatever
01:52:47 that could be cool
01:52:49 they gave Elrond very short hair
01:52:51 which is odd
01:52:53 they did that in like animated movies before
01:52:55 but
01:52:57 theoretically I don't really care
01:52:59 but it does seem like
01:53:01 either they just wanted to make the characters
01:53:03 more distinguishable
01:53:05 or they just wanted to make some of them
01:53:07 look more masculine more traditionally
01:53:09 masculine also like
01:53:11 making the gender roles a little more clear
01:53:13 I'm okay with it
01:53:15 if like there's like maybe one
01:53:17 elf group that like
01:53:19 oh yeah other elves grow their hair long
01:53:21 we cut our short because like
01:53:23 I don't know we live in the
01:53:25 in the hills or whatever
01:53:27 we live in the rolling
01:53:29 hills and it's hot
01:53:31 out there so we cut our hair
01:53:33 or just cut them short for war
01:53:35 or whatever
01:53:37 you can make up anything
01:53:39 it doesn't exist
01:53:41 yeah but don't you know that they are like
01:53:43 ruining Tolkien's legacy
01:53:45 they are actually going to rewrite the books
01:53:47 and he's dead
01:53:49 he's dead it doesn't matter
01:53:51 but before we achieve the England
01:53:53 how would you fear if they cast a white guy
01:53:55 in black panther
01:53:57 but never paint
01:53:59 I want to be a puppet
01:54:01 give
01:54:03 no
01:54:05 never give never
01:54:07 never paint is just
01:54:09 he's just concerned about the integrity
01:54:11 of his homeland of England
01:54:13 you just got to let him
01:54:15 you just got to let him have this one
01:54:17 okay one last
01:54:19 thing on the hair thing
01:54:21 seeing a lot of fan art over the last few years
01:54:23 of the Simmarillion characters
01:54:25 I can kind of understand why they wanted
01:54:27 to give all the elves different hair
01:54:29 cuts because you couldn't distinguish
01:54:31 them otherwise
01:54:33 like I just
01:54:35 posted the fan art of like the entire
01:54:37 like House of Finnaut
01:54:39 and Fingalfin
01:54:41 I guess House of Finnaut
01:54:43 and like they're all just long
01:54:45 haired pretty boys
01:54:47 that's all what they are
01:54:49 they all part their hair
01:54:51 the same way
01:54:53 and if you have a cast where
01:54:55 like in Lord of the Rings moves you only had
01:54:57 like one elf that was important
01:54:59 they go last for most of the time
01:55:01 and if you have a cast with like 10 elves
01:55:03 yeah makes sense
01:55:05 you got to do something
01:55:07 you got to do something to make them look
01:55:09 the show can still suck though
01:55:11 but I'm hopeful
01:55:13 I'm always hopeful
01:55:15 I don't know
01:55:17 one thing I always liked about
01:55:19 World of Warcraft is
01:55:21 obviously since it's a game where you can play
01:55:23 as all of these different fancy races
01:55:25 customization
01:55:27 is always like key
01:55:29 like the ability to have
01:55:31 many different hairstyles
01:55:33 with new ones added every so often
01:55:35 various skin tones for
01:55:37 every race
01:55:41 it's great
01:55:43 I like character customization
01:55:45 and
01:55:47 you can make stuff that looks
01:55:49 so different
01:55:51 but still fits within what is
01:55:53 understood to be that kind of a race
01:55:55 like a goblin still looks
01:55:57 like a goblin even though it's got all these different
01:55:59 things about it
01:56:01 the Peter Jackson movies
01:56:03 work great in my opinion
01:56:05 at least the first three
01:56:07 but I think they did
01:56:09 a little bit of a damage
01:56:11 to the general perception
01:56:13 of Tolkien's world
01:56:15 because they were so successful
01:56:17 that they outgrew the books
01:56:19 and every new adaptation
01:56:21 has to fight against that now
01:56:23 they kind of marvel-movie
01:56:25 way more people have seen the marvel movies
01:56:27 than have read the comic books
01:56:29 so the movie versions are
01:56:31 the version that most people
01:56:33 or elves have to have long hair now
01:56:35 forever or else everyone will complain
01:56:37 wait weren't you
01:56:39 just complaining about
01:56:41 an elf not having long hair
01:56:45 yeah
01:56:47 I can see both sides of the argument I would say
01:56:51 I hate people who dismiss it
01:56:53 just because they have long hair
01:56:55 but I
01:56:57 can critique it but I can also see
01:56:59 why they would do it
01:57:01 it's fine
01:57:03 I can also
01:57:05 it's just a thing
01:57:07 it's a hairstyle
01:57:09 you can change your hair and if there's a clan
01:57:11 you have to wear your hair this way
01:57:13 then it would make sense
01:57:15 that's the fashion
01:57:17 that's what we like
01:57:19 us elves we like doing this
01:57:21 if there's different elves that live in different places
01:57:23 that wear their hair different
01:57:25 you just explain it that way
01:57:27 it's not like a
01:57:29 you don't
01:57:31 baby elves
01:57:33 don't come out of the womb looking
01:57:35 like with that hair parting
01:57:37 with the long hair
01:57:39 you know what's weird
01:57:41 in Song of Ice and Fire
01:57:43 that I sort of knew
01:57:45 but hadn't really thought about
01:57:47 but is totally
01:57:49 true
01:57:51 in Song of Ice and Fire
01:57:53 in Planetos
01:57:55 there's
01:57:57 never straight up just like
01:57:59 pseudo human
01:58:01 basically like Neanderthals
01:58:03 or like even more distantly related
01:58:05 like almost humans
01:58:07 squishers
01:58:09 and there's one from
01:58:11 Sotheros and there's one that lives on that
01:58:13 one little island up to the north
01:58:15 of like
01:58:17 the Dothraki continent
01:58:19 I don't remember what they're called but like
01:58:21 yeah there are these like
01:58:23 people that are like
01:58:25 sort of human and some of them
01:58:27 can sort of speak
01:58:29 like human language but like
01:58:31 they can't breed with humans
01:58:33 or they'll only have stillbirth offspring
01:58:35 which is like really
01:58:37 freaky
01:58:39 Neanderthals
01:58:43 Neanderthals could theoretically
01:58:45 maybe breed with
01:58:47 Homo sapiens
01:58:49 but I think that's what that's alluding to
01:58:51 the time in history where
01:58:53 Homo sapiens sapiens and Neanderthals
01:58:55 existed at the same time for a bit
01:58:57 yeah but like even more
01:58:59 different right like even more
01:59:01 like I don't know
01:59:03 there's one that are down in like the
01:59:05 southern
01:59:07 place the Sotheros that are like
01:59:09 they're very like ape like
01:59:11 it's actually called Sotheros
01:59:13 I don't know if that's like an official name
01:59:15 that might just be a fandom name
01:59:17 there's Westeros and Essos
01:59:19 and that's all I know
01:59:21 I think
01:59:23 I don't know if it's a fan name or if it's a
01:59:25 planetos is definitely a fan name
01:59:27 that's true the planet doesn't actually
01:59:29 have a name
01:59:31 oh shit I don't remember what these other
01:59:33 people are called but like
01:59:35 imagine if that was real in the real world
01:59:37 I mean it used to be
01:59:39 I know but like
01:59:41 imagine if there were like
01:59:43 some place in like a jungle
01:59:45 in like I don't know Africa
01:59:47 or like South America or
01:59:49 where you could go and there
01:59:51 yeah and there were like
01:59:53 and there were bigfoots and like you could
01:59:55 talk to them and they could kind of learn
01:59:57 English and talk back to you and they sort of had
01:59:59 a little village they built little huts and lived in them
02:00:01 and they would forage for berries
02:00:03 and stuff and you could even like
02:00:05 go and trade with them if you wanted to but like
02:00:07 and like
02:00:09 someone at some point
02:00:11 discovered that
02:00:13 if you fucked one
02:00:15 you could get it pregnant but the baby would be still born
02:00:17 and like
02:00:19 you don't know who figured that out
02:00:21 but somebody did and we know this
02:00:23 we know this is true
02:00:25 but don't ask out
02:00:27 probably true of almost anything else in the animal kingdom
02:00:29 except us
02:00:31 it's just for
02:00:33 it's a freaky idea
02:00:35 if I lived near
02:00:37 creatures like that they would freak me out
02:00:39 a lot
02:00:41 that's all we would show them your mobile phone
02:00:43 and they wouldn't understand
02:00:45 your apps
02:00:47 like how do I explain my apps
02:00:49 to this creature
02:00:53 I can't even
02:00:55 begin
02:00:57 to answer that question
02:00:59 hey guys
02:01:01 do you know
02:01:03 why they didn't just ask the eagles to bring
02:01:05 the ring into more door
02:01:07 cause they were still eggs
02:01:09 they haven't hatched yet
02:01:11 the Ibnis are they like the one
02:01:13 they just live on this one little island
02:01:15 what are they
02:01:17 what's their special thing
02:01:19 they're short
02:01:21 but heavy, broad shoulder
02:01:23 broad chested, have long arms
02:01:25 they kinda sound like neanderthals actually
02:01:27 short and thick necks, massive jaws
02:01:29 and large square teeth, small sunken eyes
02:01:33 yeah they are able to reproduce
02:01:35 but the offspring usually come out deformed
02:01:39 they can speak
02:01:41 but not very well
02:01:43 I think
02:01:45 Preston's theory is that the others are also just like that
02:01:47 and they're just like another
02:01:49 people that
02:01:51 struggles up there and that's
02:01:53 why they're attacking us or something
02:01:55 I think he did a video
02:01:57 talking about these
02:01:59 and I think he said
02:02:01 that the others are a little different
02:02:03 the others seem like they have some magical
02:02:05 or technological
02:02:07 explanation
02:02:09 like ice and stuff
02:02:11 Preston's whole thing is that
02:02:13 everything in Game of Thrones
02:02:15 is actually sci-fi
02:02:17 that's his big theory
02:02:19 but the show just kind of
02:02:21 went against all of that
02:02:23 and explained nothing
02:02:25 and it's all just magic
02:02:27 the oily stone
02:02:31 Preston thinks it's plastic
02:02:33 and
02:02:35 I guess that kinda sounds like how someone
02:02:37 knows what plastic was might describe plastic
02:02:39 there's a lot of fun things like that
02:02:41 I mean the biggest
02:02:43 clue that convinces me personally
02:02:45 is that George R.R. Martin is just a sci-fi writer
02:02:47 and he's written so many other sci-fi stories
02:02:49 that have kind of the same things
02:02:51 going on that go on in Game of Thrones
02:02:55 like Hive Minds
02:02:57 and
02:02:59 weird like
02:03:01 genealogical stuff
02:03:03 a song of bits and bytes
02:03:05 the people that may say Preston
02:03:07 just don't understand
02:03:09 that like everything that he says
02:03:11 is like, he only says it because
02:03:13 it's like George R.R. Martin has written
02:03:15 that exact same thing in a different story
02:03:17 and like
02:03:19 he's got reasons
02:03:21 for everything
02:03:23 and it's like, I don't know, people come in
02:03:25 with preconceptions, they come in with preconceptions
02:03:27 about what a fantasy story should be
02:03:29 but then Preston was like
02:03:31 well, okay
02:03:33 but like when George
02:03:35 wrote a very similar thing
02:03:37 back in the 70s
02:03:39 here's what the twist ended up being
02:03:41 and it's like
02:03:43 oh, yeah, that is
02:03:45 basically the exact same thing
02:03:47 that's how his writing works most of the time
02:03:49 the children of the forest or whatever
02:03:51 yeah, oh
02:03:53 kind of sounds like he's kind of telling the same
02:03:55 story again
02:03:57 yeah
02:03:59 it took it back to Lord of Rings
02:04:01 for a second
02:04:03 I have a question
02:04:05 this is a hypothetical
02:04:07 I want to talk about the Ibn Is
02:04:09 no
02:04:11 this is way more important
02:04:13 if Sauron got the ring back
02:04:15 and all the power of Mordor
02:04:17 and all the things he wanted
02:04:19 and then aliens showed up
02:04:21 would he win, would he be able to defend
02:04:23 Earth with his powers
02:04:25 sorry, would who? Sauron?
02:04:27 Sauron
02:04:29 could Sauron defeat the aliens?
02:04:31 well, there are no aliens
02:04:33 that's a problem
02:04:35 no, no, no
02:04:37 imagine if there were aliens
02:04:39 no, no, no, no
02:04:41 imagine aliens came down
02:04:43 and they were like, beep boop
02:04:45 we're gonna shoot you with a laser gun
02:04:47 like Rick and Morty, you know that show
02:04:49 well, they wouldn't because that's not Iluvatar's plan
02:04:51 for creation
02:04:53 I'm sorry, that's not in the heavenly music
02:04:55 because I love God
02:04:57 Jesus, and I know these things
02:04:59 no, no, no, Iluvatar
02:05:01 made more than just the things
02:05:03 on Middle Earth, he had other planets
02:05:05 this is so heretical
02:05:07 right now
02:05:09 he's got so many other projects going on
02:05:11 so many irons in the fire and he still hasn't finished his book
02:05:13 he's gonna make
02:05:15 okay, but you know what?
02:05:17 Sauron maybe couldn't deal with the aliens
02:05:19 but Morgoth at the end of the
02:05:21 first age where he had
02:05:23 giant dragons the size of mountains
02:05:25 and
02:05:27 armies of Balrogs
02:05:29 yeah, maybe
02:05:31 I don't know
02:05:33 Sauron's
02:05:35 whole empire
02:05:37 is kind of a pale imitation of what Morgoth had going on
02:05:39 he's just
02:05:41 Morgoth's underling trying to recreate the good old times
02:05:45 on the other hand, the moon
02:05:47 does exist
02:05:49 in Lord of the Rings
02:05:51 so if there was an alien invasion
02:05:53 maybe moon aliens
02:05:55 would be the main aliens
02:05:57 okay, no, but the moon is not actually big
02:05:59 or like
02:06:01 the moon is not like a celestial object
02:06:03 the moon is like a flower
02:06:05 I think
02:06:07 it's a flower of a tree getting carried by an angelic being
02:06:09 it's not our
02:06:11 stone ice moon
02:06:13 little tiny flower bugs
02:06:15 little tiny flower bugs, little tiny hollow night bugs
02:06:17 would come down from the moon
02:06:19 and they'd come down
02:06:21 exactly
02:06:23 that's what I'm saying
02:06:25 that's what I've been saying for years
02:06:27 great, we solved it
02:06:29 yep
02:06:31 would cowboys defeat Mordor
02:06:33 think about this
02:06:35 if cowboys rode into town with their guns
02:06:37 well, Mordor was working on
02:06:39 like, I mean, his Sauron man
02:06:41 was working on like gunpowder
02:06:43 so
02:06:45 they were getting there, they were not that far from cowboys
02:06:47 I'd like to see that
02:06:49 I'd like to see a future where
02:06:51 Sauron got the one ring
02:06:53 and they invented guns
02:06:55 and then we had orcs
02:06:57 riding wargs
02:06:59 with rifles and guns
02:07:01 going yee-haw
02:07:03 actually, I have good news for you
02:07:05 orcs ride wargs or goblins
02:07:07 goblins ride wargs
02:07:09 goblins do, I don't know what orcs do
02:07:11 I guess they would walk like idiots
02:07:13 are goblins the same as orcs?
02:07:15 in the hobbit, he calls them goblins
02:07:17 because it's more of a children's story, it sounds cuter
02:07:19 I guess, and at some point
02:07:21 he just switches to calling them all orcs
02:07:23 just like the elves are also called gnomes
02:07:25 in the earliest writings
02:07:27 in the hobbit, are the goblins
02:07:29 bigger than Bilba
02:07:31 or are they like human size?
02:07:33 they're like smaller than humans
02:07:35 but bigger than dwarfs and
02:07:37 hobbits
02:07:39 so about how the movie
02:07:41 depicts them
02:07:43 they're a little too big and mighty
02:07:45 like the urokai are these
02:07:47 giant monsters in the movies
02:07:49 and they're supposed to be
02:07:51 are the urokai sort of like orcish super soldiers?
02:07:53 they are, but they're almost as big
02:07:55 as a human, they still don't get there
02:07:57 because all evil creations
02:07:59 have to be inferior to
02:08:01 the original
02:08:03 god made beings
02:08:05 I kind of like
02:08:07 that they're giant in the movie
02:08:09 it sells the
02:08:11 scary factor and the danger
02:08:13 it absolutely works
02:08:15 all the practical orcs are amazing
02:08:17 and that's one of the things
02:08:19 that I really like about this new tv show
02:08:21 is that they're going back to practical
02:08:23 effects for all the orcs
02:08:25 and they hired the same studio
02:08:27 that did them for the movies and they're gonna look disgusting
02:08:29 I remember
02:08:31 I remember people complaining
02:08:33 about that shot in that one hobbit movie
02:08:35 of like the molten gold
02:08:37 in smog's
02:08:39 smog's treasure
02:08:41 and it looked really bad
02:08:43 it melted faster than
02:08:45 chocolate would melt
02:08:47 the CG is so stupid
02:08:49 gollum looks amazing and
02:08:51 a lot of the orcs
02:08:53 effects look really bad
02:08:55 gollum was like a triumph
02:08:57 gollum
02:08:59 nobody has
02:09:01 done what they did with gollum
02:09:03 maybe that's not true
02:09:05 but it was a real benchmark
02:09:07 in
02:09:09 not before
02:09:11 but even since
02:09:13 who else even
02:09:15 what's another CG creature that looks as good
02:09:17 as gollum did
02:09:19 I struggle to think of any
02:09:21 off the top of my head
02:09:23 I think one of the greatest things
02:09:25 about gollum is that they always had
02:09:27 them on set, on location
02:09:29 they had the actor
02:09:31 scrub
02:09:33 scrubbing through that little stream
02:09:35 in the landscape of New Zealand
02:09:37 and then they like replaced him
02:09:39 digitally so there was like
02:09:41 kind of little green screen involved
02:09:43 they always had him there
02:09:45 and then they redid everything in the computer
02:09:47 so it was like a lot of real life reference
02:09:49 I think that's why
02:09:51 gollum is so
02:09:53 so memorable as being
02:09:55 like a really good CG characters
02:09:57 because you know
02:09:59 when gollum picks up a rock and moves it around
02:10:01 or shuffles on the ground
02:10:03 and then you see the environment
02:10:05 react in a very physical
02:10:07 real looking way
02:10:09 so like things could technically
02:10:11 be better CG characters
02:10:13 but like the way they did gollum
02:10:15 I think is the reason it's so good
02:10:17 that reminds me of
02:10:19 Who Framed Roger Rabbit
02:10:21 you know how like
02:10:23 they would have real props on like
02:10:25 sticks and strings like manipulated
02:10:27 by people off stage
02:10:29 and then they would animate the cartoon characters
02:10:31 and bring them around
02:10:33 yeah
02:10:35 they would make it as tough
02:10:37 as possible
02:10:39 to add a 2D character into the frame
02:10:41 they would have like shadows moving across the
02:10:43 the set
02:10:45 in like dynamic ways
02:10:47 it's like what if we made it the
02:10:49 most impressive we possibly could
02:10:51 it would take a lot of effort
02:10:53 and it wouldn't necessarily make the story
02:10:55 better but it would just be cool
02:10:57 nobody does that anymore
02:10:59 there's too much effort into things
02:11:01 for cool factor they just do
02:11:03 what they are told
02:11:05 I mean that's
02:11:07 I wouldn't say there's nobody but
02:11:09 in general it gets this
02:11:11 I haven't seen anything on the level of Roger Rabbit
02:11:13 in terms of like overdoing
02:11:15 like a 2D animation thing
02:11:17 there was that one like Chip and Dale movie
02:11:19 that tried it and it didn't look
02:11:21 even as good as Roger Rabbit
02:11:23 like having that
02:11:25 combined style
02:11:27 with the voice they had a similar scene
02:11:29 I think they took
02:11:31 one of the funny things
02:11:33 is for some reason they took
02:11:35 the wrong lesson away from Gollum
02:11:37 they just started casting
02:11:39 specifically anti-circus
02:11:41 as CG characters
02:11:43 like the actor who played Gollum
02:11:45 got really successful playing other
02:11:47 CG monsters and stuff
02:11:49 it wasn't just
02:11:51 he had a great performance but the technology
02:11:53 and the inventiveness of that
02:11:55 like whole production
02:11:57 made it great
02:11:59 and they put him in every other thing
02:12:01 like he's that big evil guy
02:12:03 in the new Star Wars movies
02:12:05 like yeah but that's not
02:12:07 wait which guy?
02:12:09 that's funny casting
02:12:11 Snoke
02:12:13 Wait Gollum played Snoke?
02:12:15 yeah
02:12:17 he also played
02:12:19 Planet of the Apes
02:12:21 Caesar and also
02:12:23 King Kong I believe in the Peter Jackson
02:12:25 King Kong movie
02:12:27 I mean okay I guess
02:12:29 he's everywhere
02:12:31 sure why not
02:12:33 he also played Jon Snow
02:12:35 Jon Snow was completely CG
02:12:39 yeah
02:12:41 I see
02:12:43 actually it would be kind of cool
02:12:45 if they completely CG Jon Snow after
02:12:47 Steph to make him more in canny
02:12:49 that would be neat
02:12:51 oh like make him
02:12:53 like after he died
02:12:55 they do like
02:12:57 the thing that they do with actors
02:12:59 to sort of recreate them
02:13:01 digitally
02:13:03 but they do that with him even though the actor is still alive
02:13:05 but it's like yeah we want you to look weird though
02:13:07 we want you to look like a zombie
02:13:09 that's one of the worst things about Game of Thrones
02:13:11 is that his death didn't affect anything
02:13:13 nothing happened
02:13:15 it affected people going what's gonna happen next
02:13:17 I better buy anything
02:13:19 hang on no follow up
02:13:21 well it was technically
02:13:23 he got out of his oath
02:13:25 of being a black
02:13:27 knight not a black knight
02:13:29 but he went back to that anyways
02:13:31 who cares
02:13:33 it was a loophole because
02:13:35 if you made a promise
02:13:37 they didn't even
02:13:39 listen
02:13:41 I know power resides
02:13:43 where men think it resides
02:13:45 but like
02:13:47 you could guard until his death
02:13:49 and there's simply no way around that
02:13:51 you simply cannot
02:13:53 circumvent that unless
02:13:55 there's a tricky little magical
02:13:57 resurrection loophole
02:13:59 so fuck you
02:14:01 Sam also
02:14:03 I think Sam at some point said
02:14:05 hey we're supposed to guard the realms of men
02:14:07 doesn't mean we have to do it at the wall
02:14:09 we have to do it in general
02:14:11 yeah
02:14:13 that's another tricky little secret loophole
02:14:15 you gotta find a tricky little secret loophole somehow
02:14:17 and they don't even question it
02:14:19 actually that would be fine
02:14:21 that would be cool
02:14:23 if they said oh that's a secret loophole
02:14:25 but then it just goes to other kingdoms
02:14:27 and it's like hey I'm Jon Snow
02:14:29 I used to be a knights watch guy
02:14:31 and nobody questions it
02:14:33 he's not even questioned that people say
02:14:35 hey aren't you an oath breaker
02:14:37 don't you suck
02:14:39 but nobody does because they don't care
02:14:41 in the later seasons
02:14:43 how's Asha
02:14:45 you know I'll be honest
02:14:47 I didn't watch past the death of Jon Snow
02:14:49 I didn't see the show
02:14:51 after that
02:14:53 I heard it was really bad
02:14:55 I heard it was really bad so I didn't watch it
02:14:57 we're actually watching it together right now
02:14:59 and we just spoiled everything for Asha
02:15:01 when I get the end of season 4
02:15:03 there you go
02:15:07 I would say Game of Thrones is
02:15:09 good even a bit after
02:15:11 Jon die
02:15:13 death
02:15:15 scenes
02:15:17 gasp
02:15:19 no
02:15:21 he dies
02:15:23 that's not what the pop culture zeitgeist says
02:15:25 the production design is so pretty
02:15:27 I rewatched Game of Thrones
02:15:29 semi-recently
02:15:31 and I came to the decision
02:15:33 that
02:15:35 I like shows even when they suck
02:15:37 when people say
02:15:39 stop to this episode and don't go no further
02:15:41 no that's stupid
02:15:43 it's most of the time not worth
02:15:45 like I don't know
02:15:47 I'd rather watch the thing
02:15:49 and get all of the good out of it
02:15:51 and be a little disappointed
02:15:53 than never know what happens
02:15:55 even though I'll probably hear about it
02:15:57 really bad shows can be interesting as well
02:15:59 I love the Hobbit movies a lot
02:16:01 even though they have tons of problems
02:16:03 but I just know so much about
02:16:05 the history of them and how they got produced
02:16:07 what all went wrong
02:16:09 and it's just fascinating to see all of that
02:16:11 play out and the potential that they had
02:16:13 and what actually
02:16:15 happened with them
02:16:17 I think that the beginning
02:16:19 of the Hobbit movie is quite nice with the dwarfs
02:16:21 it's so much stuff
02:16:23 they sing that deep deep song that's like really deep
02:16:25 it's the best scene
02:16:27 it's the best scene that whole trilogy is in
02:16:29 and then Bilbo says
02:16:31 literally because they're going downhill
02:16:33 under hill and over
02:16:35 mmm yeah
02:16:37 I like that song by Leonard Nimoyd
02:16:39 about the Hobbit
02:16:41 oh yeah
02:16:43 oh I don't know
02:16:45 that's the best Hobbit adaptation
02:16:47 it's the only valid one
02:16:49 no the best Hobbit adaptation
02:16:51 is National Lampoon's
02:16:53 Board of the Rings
02:16:55 oh no
02:16:57 which I read the first like chapter
02:16:59 of
02:17:01 and oh man
02:17:03 I forget
02:17:05 what they call
02:17:07 they have some stupid other name for Hobbits
02:17:09 in Board of the Rings
02:17:11 but I remember that like
02:17:13 habits I don't know
02:17:15 but they describe whatever they call Hobbits
02:17:17 they describe them as like
02:17:19 like yeah they're small
02:17:21 they're small but they're tough
02:17:23 they can easily defeat
02:17:25 they can easily defeat a creature half their size
02:17:27 if they get the drop on them
02:17:29 and I just thought that was really funny
02:17:33 that's basically all I remember
02:17:35 can you just
02:17:37 now I wonder if you can just do that
02:17:39 like make a parody
02:17:41 a book and publish it
02:17:43 of some big franchise
02:17:45 which is like obviously that franchise
02:17:47 I guess they don't need
02:17:49 it's been done
02:17:51 if you've seen the Barry Trotter
02:17:53 but freaking fair use
02:17:55 and parody law and whatever
02:17:57 true
02:17:59 I should read those honestly
02:18:01 because now that I know that JK Rowling is horrible
02:18:03 I might actually prefer those
02:18:05 parody books
02:18:07 I mean those are old right
02:18:09 yeah they can
02:18:11 I remember seeing them at the same time
02:18:13 the books were coming out
02:18:15 I don't know anything about them
02:18:17 isn't there like a musical
02:18:19 isn't there like a stage play
02:18:21 that's like a parody of Harry Potter
02:18:23 no that was an official thing
02:18:25 it was a real
02:18:27 no not
02:18:29 not cursed child
02:18:33 the burst child
02:18:35 there's a freaking
02:18:37 Harry Potter
02:18:39 parody musical
02:18:43 nope never mind
02:18:47 maybe it's a YouTube video
02:18:49 I mean there is one called a very Potter musical
02:18:51 but that's not what I was
02:18:53 I thought there was a
02:18:55 is that the little puppet show with Snape Ghost
02:18:57 Snape Snape Snape
02:18:59 Severus Snape
02:19:01 do you know who made that
02:19:03 it was Neil Cisariga
02:19:05 Neil Cisariga
02:19:07 the guy behind
02:19:09 the guy behind everything
02:19:11 the guy behind fucking everything
02:19:13 you've ever heard of
02:19:15 Minecraft
02:19:17 the guy who did
02:19:19 the guy who did
02:19:21 the freaking ultimate showdown
02:19:23 of ultimate destiny
02:19:25 he did the Harry the Potter
02:19:27 puppet pals
02:19:29 he's lemon demon
02:19:31 mouth sounds
02:19:33 he did
02:19:35 fucking
02:19:37 there's probably like 18 other things
02:19:39 he called John Tron a piece of shit
02:19:41 that one time and it was really funny
02:19:43 yeah
02:19:45 his crowning achievement
02:19:47 yeah all that other stuff
02:19:49 is alright
02:19:51 yeah that's his master piece
02:19:53 I'm telling John Tron to go fuck himself
02:19:55 was the piece to resist
02:19:59 he made Brody Quest
02:20:01 if you know that meme video
02:20:03 yes of course
02:20:07 he's a meme master
02:20:09 he's good at making things
02:20:11 that go viral
02:20:13 Potter puppet show was really big when I was in school
02:20:15 same
02:20:17 same
02:20:19 whoa
02:20:21 how do we even
02:20:23 get on this topic
02:20:25 I've lost the thread
02:20:27 we're just circling from
02:20:29 we're circling the drain
02:20:31 of eternity
02:20:33 Game of Thrones to Lord Rings
02:20:35 back to Harry Potter
02:20:37 as all things go
02:20:39 what would happen
02:20:41 if you gave the ring
02:20:43 to a cricket
02:20:45 no
02:20:47 you know what
02:20:49 it's rock paper scissors
02:20:51 Game of Thrones
02:20:53 Game of Thrones beats
02:20:55 Lord of the Rings
02:20:57 because Game of Thrones is a dark
02:20:59 is a dark
02:21:01 subversion of fantasy tropes
02:21:05 Lord of the Rings beats Harry Potter
02:21:07 because Lord of the Rings is good
02:21:09 and Harry Potter beats
02:21:11 Game of Thrones
02:21:13 because it made more money
02:21:15 I don't know
02:21:17 Harry Potter should not be
02:21:19 made to all the money
02:21:21 you know
02:21:23 they all made a shit ton of money
02:21:25 when it comes to
02:21:27 childhood film franchises
02:21:29 it used to
02:21:31 that I like
02:21:33 there was Lord of the Rings
02:21:35 and Harry Potter coming out at the same time
02:21:37 but then there was Pirates of the Caribbean
02:21:39 I think Pirates of the Caribbean is better
02:21:41 than Harry Potter
02:21:43 it's not based on a book
02:21:45 it's based on a
02:21:47 Disney ride
02:21:49 no
02:21:51 it's not based on a book series
02:21:53 give me a break
02:21:55 it's got to be based on a book series
02:21:57 I could write a book about it
02:21:59 and then it would be based
02:22:01 still
02:22:03 Princess Bride
02:22:05 that's based on a book
02:22:07 is Princess Bride better than Harry Potter
02:22:09 in my current estimation
02:22:11 I would say
02:22:13 it's better than Harry Potter
02:22:15 I probably wouldn't have said so as a kid
02:22:17 people say that
02:22:19 Percy Jackson is the good version
02:22:21 of Harry Potter
02:22:23 I've never read it
02:22:25 after my time
02:22:27 but I have heard that
02:22:29 during my time
02:22:31 the people that read
02:22:33 Percy Jackson
02:22:35 are too young to have real opinions
02:22:37 so I won't trust that until
02:22:39 maybe for like 5 more years
02:22:41 and if they still say that then maybe
02:22:43 maybe
02:22:45 you guys ever read the Spooks
02:22:47 series of novels
02:22:49 good question
02:22:51 they probably have a different title in German honestly
02:22:53 it's about this
02:22:55 it's been a long time since I've read these
02:22:57 but
02:22:59 it's like a wizard thing
02:23:01 but with very specific rules
02:23:03 vampires
02:23:05 can't cross like a line of salt
02:23:07 so if you're summoning a vampire
02:23:09 for a thing you have to make sure your salt line
02:23:11 is done and there's pentagrams
02:23:13 that's a classic vampire rule
02:23:15 yeah it's a lot of classic
02:23:17 mythical wizarding
02:23:19 rules and
02:23:21 you're a spook that's the name of your job
02:23:23 as you go to places and you
02:23:25 sort out problems as a spook
02:23:27 and there's the Spooks Apprentice
02:23:29 who's the 7th son of a 7th son
02:23:31 means you're allowed to be a spook
02:23:33 this guy
02:23:35 he's a wizard spook man
02:23:37 and he gets this youngster
02:23:39 under his wing
02:23:41 and there's an adventural 3 or 4
02:23:43 and I enjoyed them very much
02:23:45 that sounds like something I would
02:23:47 have been really into
02:23:49 it reminds me of the
02:23:51 Bartimeo sequence
02:23:53 Bartimeo's trilogy, Pog, yes I read those
02:23:55 it's like 4 books I think
02:23:57 but I think the 4 porn
02:23:59 is actually like a prequel
02:24:01 that takes place in like
02:24:03 super long ago times
02:24:05 I don't remember
02:24:07 those were good too
02:24:09 Ever heard of Wizards Hall?
02:24:11 Nope
02:24:13 Wizards Hall is
02:24:15 a single novel
02:24:17 about a kid
02:24:19 who goes to wizard school
02:24:21 and it came out 6 years before
02:24:23 Harry Potter
02:24:25 and I actually had read it
02:24:27 before Harry Potter
02:24:29 and it was like wow
02:24:31 this is kind of similar to that other book
02:24:33 but nobody knows about Wizards Hall
02:24:35 it never
02:24:37 kept, it never continued
02:24:39 so I don't know
02:24:41 that's it, that's it, that's the thing about
02:24:43 Wizards Hall
02:24:45 Did everybody see another British
02:24:47 book series that came out before
02:24:49 Harry Potter
02:24:51 was like
02:24:53 the worst witch
02:24:55 it's like a book franchise
02:24:57 I've never seen that somewhere
02:24:59 they made a TV adaptation
02:25:01 oh yeah there's also a movie
02:25:03 that features
02:25:05 what's his name
02:25:07 something curry, Tim Curry?
02:25:09 Tim Curry, Tim Curry
02:25:11 yeah as a wizard that the girls
02:25:13 spoon over
02:25:15 hmm
02:25:17 oh these are from
02:25:19 oh wow, okay I mean
02:25:21 some of them came out in like the 70s
02:25:23 but they were
02:25:25 they were still coming out in like
02:25:27 the 2010s
02:25:29 I remember this book cover
02:25:31 I don't know if I read it but I remember
02:25:33 seeing this in a library
02:25:35 post
02:25:37 image
02:25:39 the worst witch has been running for longer than
02:25:41 The Simpsons
02:25:43 Holy shit, yeah
02:25:45 I thought nothing has
02:25:47 before The Simpsons
02:25:49 we didn't have
02:25:51 what's known as a televisions
02:25:53 oh no
02:25:55 the tragedy
02:25:57 yeah I feel like I
02:25:59 missed out on a bunch of those
02:26:01 because I was so hyper fixated on
02:26:03 Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings when I was young
02:26:05 hey you know
02:26:07 what though? I think
02:26:09 this book
02:26:11 this book came up in my image search
02:26:13 and I feel like we should
02:26:15 talk about it
02:26:17 I'm sorry my internet is being shitty but the
02:26:19 image will load shortly and it's gonna
02:26:21 blow you away
02:26:23 with how funny and silly and goofy and
02:26:25 kooky
02:26:27 the thing that it will show you
02:26:29 is
02:26:31 just you wait
02:26:33 and he's second now
02:26:35 that bar is almost full there we go
02:26:41 I assume this is like a Christian
02:26:43 like an evangelical Christian thing
02:26:47 why don't we celebrate
02:26:49 Halloween
02:26:51 I try to witness this don't celebrate anything I think
02:26:53 I mean that
02:26:55 and like Christians who think
02:26:57 anything that's remotely about magic
02:26:59 is saintannic
02:27:01 yeah that's I think there are more
02:27:03 I think there are more evangelicals
02:27:05 than there are Jehovah's Witnesses
02:27:07 but I mean I guess their reasons are similar
02:27:09 yeah I'm
02:27:11 trying to read the description here on
02:27:13 faithandflame.com
02:27:15 where
02:27:17 and the description
02:27:19 cuts off I can't read the whole description
02:27:21 it ends in a dot dot dot
02:27:23 so I don't oh wait
02:27:25 this is why you should be
02:27:27 ready to explain Halloween to a kid
02:27:29 sharing the dangers of Halloween
02:27:31 and discussing Halloween as a pagan
02:27:33 holiday yep this book
02:27:35 will help your child have a Christian perspective
02:27:37 on Halloween making it clear
02:27:39 why you don't celebrate the holiday it
02:27:41 reveals in story form the truth behind
02:27:43 the activities that have become such an accepted
02:27:45 part of Halloween traditions
02:27:47 children who read this book
02:27:49 and talk about it with their parents will learn how the
02:27:51 quote fun of Halloween
02:27:53 harms them they will also
02:27:55 learn what to say to others who do not
02:27:57 understand the true meaning of Halloween
02:27:59 oh my god
02:28:01 no no customer
02:28:03 reviews oh cringe
02:28:07 the Christian
02:28:09 kids on Halloween will don their paladin
02:28:11 armor they get their sword
02:28:13 and they just lay all the monsters
02:28:15 go out and slay all the other kids yeah
02:28:17 well you shouldn't
02:28:19 told you told you told you
02:28:21 your quote unquote fun would harm you
02:28:23 you didn't listen
02:28:25 you know I never celebrate the Halloween
02:28:27 and I would have liked
02:28:29 an explanation because all American cartoon
02:28:31 shows had Halloween
02:28:33 yeah
02:28:35 they didn't
02:28:37 when I was in Poland
02:28:39 I mean they did they did Halloween
02:28:41 they didn't really like do it
02:28:43 to the same extent
02:28:45 like
02:28:47 we definitely didn't
02:28:49 have trick or treating like I saw yeah
02:28:51 I saw some people walking around in costumes
02:28:53 but I didn't really see any like trick or
02:28:55 treating exactly
02:28:57 which is I only ever went trick or treating
02:28:59 with my mom
02:29:01 when I was very little which is very weird
02:29:03 because like our country is like way
02:29:05 safer than the U.S.
02:29:07 like yeah if anything
02:29:09 we should go out trick or treating
02:29:11 even more
02:29:13 yeah I mean
02:29:15 all right I mean
02:29:17 there's a I mean I'm taking
02:29:19 this based off of like just seeing
02:29:21 American TV and movies where like
02:29:23 Halloween episodes they're always
02:29:25 in the suburbs
02:29:27 and oh yeah
02:29:29 there's more of like cul-de-sacs
02:29:31 and like more of a I don't know
02:29:33 just I have like two streets to go down
02:29:35 and there's not much that can happen
02:29:37 where everyone's looking outside all the time
02:29:39 yeah it's sort of a
02:29:41 contained but I don't know how much more
02:29:43 safe that is than like a London suburb
02:29:45 where the houses are smaller
02:29:47 and closer together
02:29:49 but it's still like a suburb
02:29:51 where I grew up was not good
02:29:53 for trick or treating at all
02:29:55 I mean we did it a little bit
02:29:57 we would drive to a neighborhood that was a little bit better
02:29:59 for it but
02:30:01 we were like super big on trick or treating
02:30:03 I mean we did it
02:30:05 I dressed up one time for Halloween
02:30:07 because I found a book in a library
02:30:09 that was like fun
02:30:11 children's crafting tips for Halloween
02:30:13 and I dressed up as a spider
02:30:15 at like
02:30:17 face paint at like multiple eyes
02:30:19 painted on my face and had like a green
02:30:21 like net for like trees
02:30:23 to like put trees in or something
02:30:25 around me I was walking around like that
02:30:27 all day just going to the mall
02:30:29 with my parents or something and people
02:30:31 looked at me very weird like
02:30:33 it was not expected
02:30:35 for a child to be in costume
02:30:37 at Halloween
02:30:39 When do you ever get the word costumes?
02:30:41 Fushing
02:30:43 Well we have like Carnival
02:30:45 like that's like our costume
02:30:47 thing
02:30:49 but that's also kind of regional here
02:30:51 like it's not happening everywhere
02:30:53 One time I went to
02:30:55 I was in Dusseldorf
02:30:57 and there was a
02:30:59 there was a festival going on
02:31:01 and there were people in costumes
02:31:03 there were some I remember
02:31:05 some people were dressed as the Beagle Boys
02:31:07 there were other costumes but I remember
02:31:09 there were people in costumes at the point
02:31:11 and it wasn't Halloween it was some other like
02:31:13 some other holiday that people were doing
02:31:15 We have that period between
02:31:17 November and February
02:31:19 where it's like fushing season
02:31:21 and at the beginning at the end the celebrations
02:31:23 like I said it's kind of regional
02:31:25 and there's a lot of like
02:31:27 parades and stuff
02:31:29 like dances
02:31:31 That's when we would like dress up in school
02:31:33 and like play games
02:31:35 and gym hall or whatever
02:31:37 But it's not spooky themed
02:31:39 Halloween is cool because it's
02:31:41 spooky themed. Carnival is just like
02:31:43 general dress up
02:31:45 So you get two opportunities to dress up
02:31:47 in costumes
02:31:49 Yeah kind of
02:31:51 Yeah
02:31:53 It's not but it doesn't have the trick
02:31:55 or treating it doesn't have going out at night
02:31:57 without your parents and getting sweets
02:31:59 That's cool
02:32:01 I wanted that
02:32:03 like in my
02:32:05 American cartoons
02:32:07 It's just like one of my American cartoons
02:32:09 TV shows and movies
02:32:11 I like never went trick or treating without my parents
02:32:13 because like
02:32:15 when I was a kid parents would drive me
02:32:17 to a neighborhood that was like
02:32:19 trick or treat friendly and like by the time I was
02:32:21 like old enough that
02:32:23 I was like drive myself
02:32:25 and I didn't really want to be like
02:32:27 doing it
02:32:29 You know
02:32:31 It's a little cringe if you know what I'm saying
02:32:35 Yeah
02:32:37 They get the point
02:32:39 At some point it becomes less cringe again
02:32:41 and you wish that you could do it
02:32:45 I mean I guess
02:32:47 I've been googling the worst witch
02:32:49 because I've convinced
02:32:51 that I did see this TV show
02:32:53 on CBBC at some point
02:32:55 and I think I did
02:32:57 and I think I did also have a crush on the main actress
02:32:59 Wait what?
02:33:01 The worst witch
02:33:03 Oh yeah
02:33:05 1998 to 2001
02:33:07 That's the one I watched as a kid
02:33:11 Look at this opening like
02:33:13 credits where they're like green screened
02:33:15 like swiveling around
02:33:17 on the brooms
02:33:19 It's funny that this did come out before Harry Potter
02:33:21 It does look a lot like it
02:33:23 And it's basically
02:33:25 just the plot of
02:33:27 Little Witch Academia
02:33:29 because it's an old girl's school
02:33:31 Yeah
02:33:33 But they're all British in this one
02:33:35 I assume
02:33:37 That was a BBC thing of course they are
02:33:41 I'm sorry the best
02:33:43 The best Harry Potter
02:33:45 alternative is still BP Blocksberg
02:33:47 That was
02:33:49 that was my
02:33:51 big Harry Potter alternative
02:33:53 It's like a big German TV show
02:33:55 and like audio book character
02:33:57 She's a witch
02:33:59 and she goes on adventures
02:34:01 and there's a movie that came out around the same time
02:34:03 as Harry Potter and it's
02:34:05 very much copying the Harry Potter aesthetic
02:34:07 and the music and
02:34:09 but still good
02:34:11 still good and not transphobic
02:34:13 and great
02:34:15 That's all I wanted to be
02:34:17 Now I'm thinking about it
02:34:19 Was Harry Potter the first
02:34:21 big male
02:34:23 witch thing
02:34:25 Because there's a lot of witches
02:34:27 as a female archetype
02:34:29 Well
02:34:31 Wizard's Hall is about a boy who goes to wizard school
02:34:33 So Wizard's Hall
02:34:35 You did it
02:34:37 I think it's amazing that Hogwarts
02:34:39 is called school for witch
02:34:41 craft and wizardry
02:34:43 You have to
02:34:45 gender divide that
02:34:47 If a witch does it
02:34:49 it's a witchcraft
02:34:51 Why?
02:34:53 That part of it has always been
02:34:55 in history
02:34:57 Witches are women
02:34:59 and wizards are different
02:35:01 But it's a real world for them
02:35:03 So they should just have one term for it
02:35:05 Okay
02:35:07 But it's not like magicians
02:35:09 It's not like JK came up with that
02:35:11 Yeah
02:35:13 It's like historically grown maybe
02:35:15 I mean JK Rowling
02:35:17 would come up with like some stupid
02:35:19 like oh it's witchcraft
02:35:21 if you were born a woman
02:35:23 if you have like a womb
02:35:25 it only counts as witchcraft
02:35:27 It's like biological
02:35:29 You will never be able to wizardry
02:35:31 Uterus magic
02:35:33 We can always tell
02:35:35 We can always tell
02:35:37 This is how we can explain
02:35:39 This is how we can fix
02:35:41 this is how we can fix JK
02:35:43 because there literally is no difference
02:35:45 between witchcraft and wizardry
02:35:47 We can just explain gender to her like that
02:35:49 and she's like oh I get it
02:35:51 it's just about the words you use
02:35:53 but it's the same oh
02:35:55 I've been so wrong
02:35:57 She would literally say
02:35:59 that the power of the testicles
02:36:01 is what makes it wizardry
02:36:03 I don't believe it
02:36:05 If you had a testicle you can't do witchcraft
02:36:07 Absolutely would
02:36:09 You're wrong
02:36:11 They are the same
02:36:13 They are the same spells
02:36:15 and the same potions and whatever
02:36:17 and I'm pretty sure there's no difference at all
02:36:19 it's just two different words
02:36:21 for the same thing
02:36:23 Expelliarmus he him
02:36:25 Yeah
02:36:27 Expelliarm
02:36:29 Wait you say
02:36:31 Expelliarmus
02:36:33 Women
02:36:35 I don't know
02:36:37 No, no, no
02:36:39 Men say
02:36:41 There are no pronouns in Harry Potter
02:36:43 Women say
02:36:45 It's the ways to do it
02:36:47 I don't know if people heard
02:36:49 my funny joke
02:36:51 Yeah
02:36:53 I gotta listen to it next week
02:36:55 I'm gonna really listen to it
02:36:59 My head
02:37:01 Back to Lord of the Rings though
02:37:03 I'm sorry
02:37:05 One last Lord of the Rings fact
02:37:07 Galadria's husband
02:37:09 Not a guy
02:37:11 Caliborn
02:37:13 What's his name?
02:37:15 Caliborn
02:37:17 From Homestuck
02:37:19 I've never seen a single Homestuck
02:37:21 You should read Homestuck because
02:37:23 Alright
02:37:25 Here's an obscure fact
02:37:27 that I'm not sure about
02:37:29 but you might be able to recall
02:37:31 talking about a green sun
02:37:33 as like if you're thinking of
02:37:35 making a world
02:37:37 and you make a green sun
02:37:39 As just an example of
02:37:41 a fantasy thing
02:37:43 you should have a reason for it
02:37:45 or something, I don't remember
02:37:47 There's a quote attributed to J.R. or Tolkien
02:37:49 about a green sun
02:37:51 with regards to writing
02:37:53 theory
02:37:55 or how to create fantasy worlds
02:37:57 and Andrew Hussey heard that
02:37:59 and he thought, well, yeah, I could just take
02:38:01 that exact thing
02:38:03 That's the lesson
02:38:05 that was supposed to be learned from that
02:38:07 I mean, I'm sure he liked
02:38:09 Tolkien's work in general
02:38:11 I just thought that would be a cool thing to lift
02:38:13 There's a green sun
02:38:15 in Homestuck
02:38:17 I mean, the green sun could have been any color
02:38:19 It could have been any color
02:38:21 That's the point of Tolkien's
02:38:23 Yeah, Tolkien's
02:38:25 just came up with some random shit
02:38:27 as an example
02:38:29 I mean, it's like
02:38:31 it's sort of like if he had made a
02:38:33 if there was a fish
02:38:35 and he'd made it red
02:38:37 because it's a red herring
02:38:39 and it's just a reference to a thing
02:38:41 Okay, okay
02:38:43 I didn't know that actually
02:38:45 Yeah, Caliburn
02:38:47 Great guy, completely irrelevant
02:38:49 for most of the time because Caliburn
02:38:51 is like the most important person
02:38:53 and super powerful
02:38:55 Caliburn is one of the wisest elves
02:38:57 in Middle Earth, but that's
02:38:59 they all are
02:39:01 Yeah, there's no real evidence
02:39:03 He doesn't really do anything, he's just a trophy husband
02:39:07 But the thing
02:39:09 of Caliburn is
02:39:11 he has a very funny name
02:39:13 because his Teleri name
02:39:15 from the elves that lived by the sea
02:39:17 and they have their own language
02:39:19 called Teleri
02:39:21 I guess it's like an accent of Sindali
02:39:23 like that, but his original
02:39:25 Teleri name is
02:39:27 Telepono
02:39:29 like
02:39:31 Telepono
02:39:33 Wow, cool
02:39:37 Sounds almost like a request
02:39:39 And I think talking
02:39:41 every day for that
02:39:43 and I'm very happy that this is in there
02:39:45 That's your Tolkien fact
02:39:47 That's why he's the best
02:39:49 writer ever
02:39:51 Yes
02:39:53 That's
02:39:55 That's it
02:39:57 That's a freaking George Lucas
02:39:59 Oh yeah
02:40:01 Well this guy's name in the original language
02:40:03 is Telepono
02:40:05 because it's like
02:40:07 it rhymes
02:40:09 with
02:40:11 Teleponography
02:40:13 Because he's a really sexy guy
02:40:15 I think Tolkien didn't have a choice
02:40:17 on television
02:40:19 You know
02:40:21 I think Tolkien didn't have a choice
02:40:23 He couldn't name him anything else
02:40:25 because the languages make so much sense
02:40:27 that just historically
02:40:29 it must have been Telepono
02:40:31 This is just the words that are his name
02:40:33 You can't call him anything else
02:40:35 What does it mean?
02:40:37 Oh wait, I should look that up
02:40:39 It probably means something important
02:40:41 Tree of the silver bird
02:40:43 How does elf language work?
02:40:45 Is it like
02:40:47 based on your place of birth
02:40:49 and how many
02:40:51 thumb wars you won
02:40:53 you get named a certain thing
02:40:55 Your parents both give you different names
02:40:57 and then at some point
02:40:59 you choose your own name based on
02:41:01 That's just like warrior cats
02:41:03 Maybe
02:41:05 Okay, alright
02:41:07 Elves are warrior cats, I get it
02:41:09 By the way, Telepono means
02:41:11 silver tall
02:41:13 because he had silver hair and was very tall
02:41:15 This is literally no other way to describe him
02:41:17 He's teleporting
02:41:19 It's kind of a boring name
02:41:21 actually
02:41:23 Yeah, even how it sounds
02:41:25 Elves just
02:41:27 I think name themselves
02:41:29 after the legends that they make
02:41:31 You know what, that is
02:41:33 kind of like a warrior cat's name though
02:41:35 isn't it?
02:41:37 Well, no, he would be called
02:41:39 Can a cat be tall?
02:41:41 He would be called silver thrush
02:41:43 or something, or he would be called
02:41:45 tall leaf
02:41:47 or something like that
02:41:49 because you have to have an adjective
02:41:51 and a thing
02:41:53 in nature, or it's two things in nature
02:41:55 right?
02:41:57 Is it a cat name?
02:41:59 Yeah
02:42:01 Is it why warrior cats can have names?
02:42:03 How can you say that? Wait, isn't that
02:42:05 the same generation as Percy Jackson
02:42:07 I feel like that's the same thing
02:42:09 Maybe a little older
02:42:11 I think it's a little older than that
02:42:13 Maybe
02:42:15 It's one of these series with way too many books
02:42:17 I mean, I never read it
02:42:19 Yeah, it's still going
02:42:21 I mean, so is Percy Jackson, I believe
02:42:23 at least some of the spin-off series
02:42:25 Wow, okay
02:42:27 How could you write all the time?
02:42:29 How could you do that?
02:42:31 I mean, they probably have
02:42:33 I mean, warrior cats
02:42:35 they have ghost writers and stuff
02:42:37 They're dead?
02:42:39 Yes
02:42:41 They die?
02:42:43 They kill them and they enslave their spirit
02:42:45 and they said, you will
02:42:47 You will write about these cats
02:42:49 You'll work off your sins
02:42:51 in the typewriter minds
02:42:53 you will type
02:42:55 until your spirit is cleansed
02:42:57 of evil
02:42:59 I know nothing about no warrior cats
02:43:01 but I just assume they go with the lore
02:43:03 that cats all have nine lives
02:43:05 and that's why the series is so long
02:43:07 It's like eight times before
02:43:09 that story's over
02:43:11 is a thing in them
02:43:13 or something
02:43:15 I don't really know too much
02:43:17 about it
02:43:19 What do we think
02:43:21 about
02:43:23 Frickin' Ask PCP
02:43:25 questions? Hell yeah
02:43:27 I feel like we've been gone for a while
02:43:29 Okay
02:43:31 Well, I've got one, this was actually asked
02:43:33 of me before
02:43:35 Ask PCP, so I'm gonna honor it
02:43:37 This is from
02:43:39 Coco Peloton
02:43:41 It's also ugly
02:43:43 I can't leave a voicemail for the podcast
02:43:45 I wanted to say, one piece
02:43:47 Dragon Ball Super and one punch man
02:43:49 all ended their current arc this week
02:43:51 and they were all shit endings
02:43:53 Tell me why, Benzane
02:43:57 Why is Oracle
02:43:59 It's because
02:44:01 I don't know
02:44:03 I know
02:44:05 why people would be upset
02:44:07 there's like a choice was made
02:44:09 Wait, I know what happened
02:44:11 I actually know what happened
02:44:13 Can you say it?
02:44:15 Someone didn't join the crew
02:44:17 right?
02:44:19 Yeah, it's like a potential
02:44:21 crew joining thing
02:44:23 I have no real opinion
02:44:25 I have no real opinion
02:44:27 I mean it was to say, it's Yamato
02:44:29 I
02:44:31 from my perspective, I heard people say
02:44:33 Yamato joins the crew and I thought
02:44:35 that seemed like really quick
02:44:37 but then again
02:44:39 it probably took less chapters
02:44:41 for Sanji to join
02:44:43 for instance
02:44:45 I think at this point, a character
02:44:47 joined it because it was like Jinbei took
02:44:49 so much longer
02:44:51 than you would have expected from officially
02:44:53 They were teasing Jinbei
02:44:55 they were edging with Jinbei for years
02:44:57 and years
02:44:59 and people really wanted
02:45:01 carrot to join
02:45:03 which I don't
02:45:05 hate her, but I don't get
02:45:07 the appeal of her being in the crew
02:45:09 she's just sort of nice
02:45:11 She's cute and nice
02:45:13 but does that
02:45:15 mean you should be part of the sohats?
02:45:17 She doesn't have quite as much of
02:45:19 a role to play
02:45:21 either socially
02:45:23 or strategically in the crew
02:45:25 so that's that
02:45:27 but then Yamato's
02:45:29 coming in
02:45:31 as another potential heavy hitter
02:45:33 in the late game of the one piece
02:45:35 story
02:45:37 but he's like
02:45:39 he's a
02:45:41 he's a powerful ally
02:45:43 to protect
02:45:45 Wano when they leave
02:45:47 so I feel like
02:45:49 it's not like he's not gonna be
02:45:51 in the manga anymore
02:45:53 there's gonna be
02:45:55 stuff happening with all these characters
02:45:59 and I feel like being literally on the crew
02:46:01 doesn't mean much because there's so many characters
02:46:03 that are allied with the crew
02:46:05 that are going to show up again
02:46:07 either as enemies or allies
02:46:09 in whatever huge conflict
02:46:11 is gonna be coming up
02:46:13 with the coming to the end
02:46:15 of the actual story
02:46:17 so I don't feel like
02:46:19 it's the same as having a new character
02:46:21 on for another like 20 years of adventures
02:46:25 do you think that's what this person
02:46:27 is saying it's shitty because
02:46:29 of that? I think they're just like
02:46:31 they wanted it to be like an official thing
02:46:33 lots of people did
02:46:35 but instead no
02:46:37 and I'm like I don't mind
02:46:39 I think it's cool
02:46:41 I just want to see what happens next
02:46:43 I mean I
02:46:45 was surprised that when Jinbei joined
02:46:47 because I kind of felt like
02:46:49 I didn't need any more members
02:46:51 and I guess I kind of still feel like
02:46:53 that but I mean
02:46:55 whatever
02:46:57 I'm not like against the idea entirely
02:46:59 so I guess I
02:47:01 I'm pretty neutral on it although I haven't finished
02:47:03 I haven't actually gotten there
02:47:05 I'm like 12 chapters behind or something so
02:47:07 I should catch up
02:47:09 so I can have a real opinion
02:47:11 um okay
02:47:13 uh well anyway
02:47:15 let me
02:47:17 someone else asked me
02:47:19 is Ben caught up to one piece yet
02:47:21 and I just answered that question
02:47:23 I did catch up a while ago but now I'm behind
02:47:25 um alright
02:47:27 so let me
02:47:29 see here who responded
02:47:31 to the tweet
02:47:33 okay
02:47:35 Sankishi Seidel
02:47:37 if I'm saying that right
02:47:39 says everyone is talking like the voicemail
02:47:41 era is over can't you just back up the existing voicemails
02:47:43 uh yeah
02:47:45 the reason why it's not
02:47:47 ready is because
02:47:49 I cleared a lot of it out
02:47:51 and I thought I just had to clear out some
02:47:53 space
02:47:55 and it didn't work and I guess actually I need
02:47:57 to clear out like all the space
02:47:59 so it was sort of my bad
02:48:01 but not really
02:48:03 it should have worked
02:48:05 it just didn't
02:48:07 um okay next one
02:48:09 hey Ben I got an asked PCP for you
02:48:11 uh spotify
02:48:15 yeah
02:48:17 I think um it's not just spotify
02:48:19 the problem is like you can't download
02:48:21 the episodes conveniently anymore
02:48:23 really
02:48:25 I can't listen to them if I don't have internet
02:48:27 and that's a bit annoying
02:48:29 yeah I know
02:48:31 I said before
02:48:33 I think I'm just gonna have to accept
02:48:35 that like some of the apps will just
02:48:37 not have the first episodes on them
02:48:39 like they're just gonna have to delete
02:48:41 the old episodes
02:48:43 they're all on the website
02:48:45 they're all on the website
02:48:47 almost all on youtube
02:48:49 so I don't know at some point
02:48:51 I give up
02:48:53 I will do that
02:48:55 I just haven't done it yet
02:48:57 but yeah I gotta do it
02:48:59 you're right
02:49:01 demonica knight asks
02:49:03 PCP who has the biggest butt
02:49:05 between Ben and Gibb
02:49:07 and rank the butts of all PCP members
02:49:09 thank you
02:49:11 and wait there's an image
02:49:13 um
02:49:15 no
02:49:17 here
02:49:19 oh well yeah
02:49:21 I would agree with this
02:49:25 I mean I personally been working out
02:49:27 like doing squats more recently
02:49:29 and more regularly
02:49:31 so my butt's bigger than it was
02:49:33 that's a point in my favor
02:49:35 I don't know
02:49:37 I don't think I have a particularly large butt
02:49:39 um
02:49:41 I don't know
02:49:43 I genuinely don't know
02:49:45 how to answer
02:49:47 uh can I
02:49:49 can I rank the butts of all PCP members
02:49:51 no
02:49:53 yeah people say Nate has a big butt
02:49:55 which is very funny
02:49:57 that does kind of have a big butt because of all the exercise he used to do
02:49:59 lol
02:50:01 actually he might still but like
02:50:03 I assume so
02:50:05 I don't know if that's
02:50:07 no
02:50:09 because it's not like he was like
02:50:11 big all over
02:50:13 because he was like really buff
02:50:15 no but like his butt was
02:50:17 yeah
02:50:19 his thighs were quite large for
02:50:21 okay well here's the thing
02:50:23 his squats were bad
02:50:25 he was bad at squatting so I don't think
02:50:27 that it was like oh he just worked his like
02:50:29 his glutes out that much
02:50:31 and naturally is like that
02:50:33 well yeah good for you
02:50:35 I guess
02:50:37 all I noticed is that one screenshot from the
02:50:39 Brad Garlinghouse music video
02:50:41 where it's gigantic
02:50:43 I
02:50:45 I don't know the exact one you're talking about
02:50:47 I think it got reposted in your server
02:50:49 two days ago or something
02:50:51 cool
02:50:53 uh
02:50:55 people be talking
02:50:57 as for everyone else I have no idea
02:50:59 I just wore like baggy trousers
02:51:01 or it wasn't looking
02:51:03 so I don't know
02:51:05 p-blade spirit asks
02:51:07 Ben do you have a favorite brand of
02:51:09 gummies as a gummy candy fan
02:51:11 I quite like the albany's brand
02:51:13 or alternatively is there a brand
02:51:15 that you'd compare the ones you'd make want to make to
02:51:17 um
02:51:19 is albany's the one
02:51:21 the bears that have the a on them
02:51:23 those are okay
02:51:25 those are fine
02:51:27 ooh I like um
02:51:29 it's kind of a basic bitch
02:51:31 but I really like
02:51:33 I really like gushers and like
02:51:35 fruit by the foot and that stuff
02:51:37 that stuff's really good
02:51:39 I really like um
02:51:41 I don't know if I have a favorite brand
02:51:45 uh
02:51:47 I like uh
02:51:51 I like grapefruit flavored ones
02:51:53 whenever I go to like a candy store I look for grapefruit flavored gummy candy
02:51:55 whenever I can find those
02:51:57 I really like those
02:51:59 um
02:52:01 I don't really have a favorite brand
02:52:03 I like a wide spectrum of them
02:52:05 I like the juicy ones
02:52:07 I like the jelly-ish ones
02:52:09 I like the hard ones
02:52:11 I like the chewy ones
02:52:13 I can appreciate
02:52:15 I appreciate all different
02:52:17 there's such a spectrum
02:52:19 I think so
02:52:21 I like to think so
02:52:23 um
02:52:25 okay next one is from
02:52:27 jjava arts
02:52:29 if you could trade any one of your talent skills
02:52:31 with one of your friends
02:52:33 which one would you choose and why
02:52:37 talents skills
02:52:39 uh
02:52:41 would I have to trade all of my talents
02:52:43 with all of their talents
02:52:45 well I'd say no
02:52:47 to all things
02:52:49 I like my talents
02:52:51 one I'm trying to think
02:52:53 if you could trade one of your talents
02:52:55 with one other talent
02:52:57 with someone else's
02:52:59 um
02:53:01 I mean I would I think I've said this
02:53:03 if you could trade any one of your talent skills
02:53:05 with one of your friends
02:53:07 which one would you choose and why
02:53:09 I trade um
02:53:11 my
02:53:13 here's the thing though
02:53:15 can I never learn that skill again
02:53:17 I think so yeah
02:53:19 because you'll never you'll never be talented
02:53:21 if you trade it away you'll never be talented at it
02:53:23 but like you can be
02:53:25 untalented but work really hard
02:53:27 and like like what does talent mean
02:53:29 here no talent is everything
02:53:31 you can't do anything without talent don't you know
02:53:33 oh god
02:53:35 I think I mean obviously
02:53:37 they just mean like look some
02:53:39 people some people are just bad at something
02:53:41 and I think if you if if we're
02:53:43 taking this question seriously
02:53:45 if you trade away your talent it means you
02:53:47 become bad at it like you you can no
02:53:49 longer do it well
02:53:51 hmm
02:53:53 I mean what am I talented at then
02:53:55 because I could
02:53:57 choose something that I'm sort of good at but I don't
02:53:59 care too much about losing and then just
02:54:01 yeah like a really good thing in return
02:54:03 you could definitely you could definitely game this question
02:54:05 I could I could be like oh my my
02:54:07 talent at crochet like I'm sort of
02:54:09 good at crochet I made those little booties
02:54:11 for risker
02:54:13 but like I could trade that for like
02:54:15 munchies
02:54:17 like speaking
02:54:19 to a crowd ability
02:54:21 I mean I know what I would trade for
02:54:23 is I would trade for Maryweather's
02:54:25 marketing savvy
02:54:27 in a second
02:54:29 that's the most valuable is just
02:54:31 liking anime though that's the most valuable skill
02:54:33 that anyone that I know
02:54:35 possesses so that's what I'm going for
02:54:37 what do I trade for it
02:54:39 I don't know
02:54:41 my huge day
02:54:43 what do I need it for
02:54:47 useless get it get it out of here
02:54:49 hasn't been used in years
02:54:53 my my ability to
02:54:55 grow a full beer
02:54:57 that can go
02:54:59 that's a talent that takes it out of dedication
02:55:01 oh yeah you got a home
02:55:03 you know you got you start with natural talent
02:55:05 but then if that's a talent I would also like to
02:55:07 get rid of that please
02:55:09 okay
02:55:11 can we instead
02:55:13 can we instead trade
02:55:15 like something we're really bad at
02:55:17 against something you're just
02:55:19 okay at
02:55:21 what
02:55:23 you've completely
02:55:25 spit in the
02:55:27 spirit of this question
02:55:29 okay yeah but I just
02:55:31 I'm just reconstructing the question I want to trade
02:55:33 I want to rather be bad at something
02:55:35 else instead of being bad at that thing
02:55:37 also trade like a bad talent
02:55:39 for a different bad talent that you didn't
02:55:41 already have
02:55:43 what do you mean a bad
02:55:45 what do you mean a bad talent
02:55:47 negative talent a negative talent
02:55:49 something that you're bad at
02:55:51 traded for something that someone else is bad at
02:55:53 yeah and the thing the thing that you were
02:55:55 bad at just you become neutral
02:55:57 you become I guess okay at it
02:55:59 neither good or bad
