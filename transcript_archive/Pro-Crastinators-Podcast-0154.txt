00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome back to another episode of the Productivity Podcast.
00:00:08 And we procrastinate so you don't have to. I'm a procrastinator and now you can too.
00:00:14 Was that from a comment? Or did you just come up with that right now?
00:00:18 That was on a comment that I stole. Shout out to PacifistBetaFish who sent that comment last episode.
00:00:24 I'm the best guy ever with the most original jokes ever. Munchy's here.
00:00:31 I'm livid about the comments last episode that they were all about politics and not like
00:00:36 they were like a handful about the other topics. I can't blame them too much for that.
00:00:42 I can. Politics are like a mind virus. I like people appreciated me.
00:00:48 People appreciated me in the comments last episode.
00:00:51 I have things to say. There's a reason I'm here and that episode is the reason.
00:00:55 Oh, I can't wait. I can't wait to obliterate you with an orbital fucking strike.
00:01:00 We'll see how it goes. We'll see how it goes. Ben and Tom, we just heard them.
00:01:05 Gibbs here, HippoCrit. Hello. There you go. And of course, Jesse.
00:01:10 Guys, I've got two great topics that we've never talked about on the show before. The first is
00:01:13 Kingdom Hearts and the second one is going to be debating the merits of capitalism versus
00:01:19 communism. Oh, I can't wait. What about Pokemon? I think that's a fresh one.
00:01:22 Oh, yeah. Yeah. We can do three topics this time. Three new topics that are totally fresh.
00:01:26 Actually, we can only do one topic per episode. Sorry. I guess you didn't hear.
00:01:31 We've got rules now. We made them. Topic today is telephones. What do you think about phones?
00:01:35 I'm against them. The end. Thanks for watching, everybody.
00:01:39 I'm saying, guys, new topic today, cups. I just don't really know if they're moral,
00:01:44 you know, they just sort of seem like their life is like as valid as a normal person.
00:01:48 And I feel like I could just take it. You know, cups are all right, but I prefer,
00:01:52 I prefer mobs and tankards. Oh, sorry. And, and, you know, the little, the solo cups,
00:01:58 those are bigger than I thought. The first time I saw a solo cup, I was like, that's big.
00:02:02 I'm used to like tiny little, tiny little plastic cups and with like one sip and you're done.
00:02:07 You got to refill it something. Yes. European portions. The last time I saw a solo cup,
00:02:14 I thought that that is Luke Skywalker's sister. I thought, what are you talking about?
00:02:20 I don't get it. I don't get it at all. I thought you were just going to say you
00:02:23 killed him because he was on his own. No, no, like it's Han Solo, guys, like Star Wars,
00:02:29 your favorite. Han Solo is not Luke's sister. What are you talking about?
00:02:35 No, no, he was copying, he was copying Princess Leia who he has sex with. Listen,
00:02:42 it's not rocket science. I didn't go to Harvard. I went to the fucking dump chair outside your house
00:02:47 to find this fucking joke. That's right. I'm turning it on you.
00:02:53 Hey, why don't we make this viewer appreciation day and talk about the, the PCP dating simulator
00:02:59 that just came out that I have not had a chance to play. I also have not had a chance to play it.
00:03:05 I was too busy. God damn it. Yeah. You guys were too busy bitching about gay politics shit.
00:03:10 Yeah, I know. It didn't stop after the episode. Hey, I had a busy week. No, no, I got, I got to say,
00:03:16 I was, because I was talking, I was talking to Hippo yesterday. The message, I'm like,
00:03:18 wait, stop everyone. More important, it's my birthday. Oh, that is important. It's my birthday.
00:03:26 Thomas mid-sentence, who cares? We'll get to that later, we'll see how it goes.
00:03:31 That's why I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to say, yeah, I wanted to say it in the middle of the break.
00:03:39 Yeah, I did it. I fucking got so much, I got so much out of head.
00:03:42 Happy birthday, because Maige really cares about her friend Ben and wanted me to know.
00:03:45 Whoa, amazing. Dude, I, dude, that was the ideal time. I got, I got, I got, I got so much out of that
00:03:55 announcement. It was crowbarring. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. This is it. Maige, take a lesson. Maige,
00:03:59 take a lesson. All right. That's all I got to say. All right, how you fucking do it?
00:04:05 I've never given you, if you don't start talking right fucking now. There's like a
00:04:08 giant chasm between the two sides of this podcast now, before and after this interjection, but
00:04:14 all I was going to say, all I was going to fucking say was that I was listening to last week's PCP,
00:04:20 because that's what I do. I listen to the ones I'm not on, because I want to know, I want to,
00:04:24 I want to know what the lore is about. I want to be on point. So the next time I do show up,
00:04:28 I'm not out of the loop. You know, I don't, I got to be on the Zemp, the them snakes cannon
00:04:33 and everything. That's why I'm almost always on them, because I can't bear the thought of listening
00:04:37 to one. So let me tell you, let me fucking tell you, I was having a great time. It was one of my
00:04:44 favorite episodes in a long time. It was all this like interesting talk about creativity.
00:04:50 And I was fucking hype. I was like, this is like a return to form. This is great.
00:04:54 And then, and then at the very end, my, I immediately go totally flaccid because it
00:05:00 turns into the same old political bullshit. Oh my God. Good solid discussion. And then it turned
00:05:08 into gay shit again. Well, people in the comments hadn't been fucking wrong. I wouldn't have had to
00:05:14 correct them. But you know what, literally, it just is our, like, like, okay, Tom, I'm completely
00:05:20 with you. I resonate with you. But look at the comments. No one gave a shit about the art goals.
00:05:26 No one cares about that. If the show is to entertain and to make the most down people
00:05:31 like interested, everyone like cared about the that the politics more than the art goals and
00:05:37 wanted to comment on that. It could just be the politics or like a hot button issue and people
00:05:40 are like more likely to like comment about them. But like, like what there is there's
00:05:46 productivity cast. There were some dude like saying that like, I don't know, like, like,
00:05:52 there was just a handful of comments, maybe majority of them were just about interrupting
00:05:57 mage and politics. So I don't know. Maybe we should focus on the things that people are more
00:06:03 interested in, in a way, like interrupting me, like, making mage feel bad. That's what got the
00:06:09 most comments. So we should, we should double down. We should lean in. I did see those with
00:06:14 the top comments. They were, they were. This is I guess this really is a viewer appreciation slash
00:06:19 response episode thus far. Oh, I see a f y sama on the top 37 minutes ago just says, would you guys
00:06:26 stop with the politics? That's so some of the politics commentary is to just say to shut up
00:06:33 about it. I do agree that politics is wrong and no one should ever speak of them. But then again,
00:06:39 Ben also raised a, Ben also raised a good point. He said the commenters were wrong.
00:06:43 So I have to side with Ben on this point. We can't have commenters going around being wrong.
00:06:47 What am I just gonna let them be wrong? Forget about it. Yeah, okay.
00:06:53 About that PCP dating symbol. I played it. I played got all the endings. There's well, I mean,
00:07:00 there's like, there's not really endings. You just do certain different branches. You go to speak
00:07:05 to like Digi, Munchie, or me, or Mage. Not everyone is in the thing yet. But I really,
00:07:14 really, really like all of the little references in the dialogue and the backgrounds. I love them
00:07:19 in the background. And you know, I've got like a like a weird like, like hip thrust, like sexy
00:07:25 pose going on. That's, that's funny. I'm laughing about it. You're like a main character. You're
00:07:29 like the childhood friend or something. I am a childhood friend character. I heard that I'm not
00:07:34 in the demo. Is that true? Yeah. But I mean, your influence is pervades. It's a progressive story.
00:07:40 They just haven't gotten everything yet. Well, I mean, hope, I mean, okay, by the time this episode
00:07:44 is out, I will have played it. But as of right now, I have not to my shame to my shame. We should
00:07:50 play on the nice man. That's part of the variety. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Munchie. We recorded. Okay,
00:07:57 but this won't be a spoiler by the time this is out. We recorded me playing trying to kill the
00:08:03 rowdy rat. Dude. And then since I failed to do so, immediately, we should do it. I should,
00:08:09 I should do it on the on the stream. I should do it live. Everyone got blue gets blue balled
00:08:13 in the in the video, but then they can see it live. That's a good idea. Yeah. Oh, I was so
00:08:19 tantalizingly close. Okay. All right. Was that surprise? What was that the surprise you're
00:08:27 going to tell me before the show? Oh, no. Okay, the surprises that I have a new energy drink
00:08:32 to best you. Really? Okay. Well, first of all, okay. Okay. The score so far, I have bang and I
00:08:40 have rain on my side. I have monster ultra. I have gridlock and now you have gridlock. Okay.
00:08:48 And now I have spike. Spike. Spike hardcore energy. I can tell just by looking at it that it's
00:08:56 shit because it's one of those cans that is like just one color. Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.
00:09:00 Yeah, this has no graphic design. This is the opposite. Have you had it yet? I'm opening my very
00:09:06 first can of spike blue razz right now. Okay. I was on my way home from birthday breakfast with
00:09:13 the parents and I was like, Hey, hey, dad, pull into the 7-Eleven because I was looking for bang.
00:09:19 I got to grab the wheel and steer it right in through the windows and I did not they did not
00:09:27 have bang. However, they did have a carnival candy rain. So they did. Oh, they had rain.
00:09:34 That's the most that is the most rowdy energy drink I've ever heard. Yeah. Yeah. It is. But I,
00:09:40 you know, I wanted to try it and it was really good. I really liked it. Oh, you liked it. I did.
00:09:46 Yeah. They also had a they had a ultra paradise monster, which I have not tried yet, but I've
00:09:51 got a can of it here. But anyway, let's let's get this let's get spike. Let's get spike. I'm
00:09:55 going to hear that pop. Oh, that there it is. That was highly carbonated. Oh,
00:10:00 flavor flavor. It's good. It's a very it's high. It's a high intensity blue raspberry kind of flavor.
00:10:06 Blue raspberry. Okay. Life. Let's taste. There's a flavor in Japan specifically called blue Hawaii
00:10:12 with just aware of this with just a hint with just a hint of just a hint of nasty
00:10:18 acrid like chemical water treatment plant underneath it. Yeah, that's that's how you
00:10:23 got the bargain basements. But I but I like but I actually like it. No, it's very it's it tastes
00:10:28 like blue raspberry. There's a seven eleven right down. It's no bullshit from where I am. I kind
00:10:31 of feel like I need to go on a quest. I need to start. I need to start getting caught up on the
00:10:35 energy drink wars. I mean, I don't drink energy drinks in my humble opinion, but I mean, you're
00:10:41 not wrong. What's wrong with them? You know, they're for the week. That's my main point. Are they
00:10:46 is coffee for the week? Do you feel that way about coffee? Yes, it is. And I drink it anyway. Wait,
00:10:50 wait, wait, pause for a second. Does do energy drinks actually give you energy? Because I've
00:10:56 caffeine in general, all it does is make me feel sick. I've never it's never made me feel energetic.
00:11:02 It energizes my heart and my heart beats really fast. And then I feel like I'm going to die.
00:11:06 But I've never been like maybe it's not for everybody. I don't know. I'm with you, dude.
00:11:10 Okay, it doesn't make me feel it has no adverse effect. But honestly, like it doesn't really
00:11:13 affect me. But yeah, that I'm hopped up so often that I don't feel it. I can't imagine. I mean,
00:11:19 you're already weren't functioning at an 11. I think I might have died. I think I might have
00:11:24 developed a tolerance to caffeine. Honestly, I don't feel like it wakes me up that well. Well,
00:11:29 that's like that's that's the RPG like stat positives and stat negatives of sugar in general.
00:11:35 Is that like it's, you know, short term energy, but in the long term, you're
00:11:39 fat, sad all the time. You can't move. Plus somebody like munchy as Tom was saying, when
00:11:44 you're blood is at a certain concentration of caffeine just naturally, when you introduce an
00:11:49 outside element that to a normal person raises their energy level, but to munchy it lowers it on
00:11:54 average, you know, wait, but have the opposite effect. Was any of that true? Does your body
00:11:59 create? I mean, he's saying that your veins are already pumping full of caffeine and specifically
00:12:06 bang energy drinks. There's something like mythical and exotic about hearing stories of like
00:12:16 American garbage core processed food. That's what it feels like because it's like, you know,
00:12:23 if you're in small town America and you just go down to the to the local whatever it is fast
00:12:27 food chain, 7 11 Walmart, I don't know what they have, all those things. And you get like some
00:12:33 like, like toxic brew or like, like, like dangerous will kill you product with bright packaging.
00:12:42 Yeah. And it's just, it just feels like another world. It feels like like Neo Los Angeles City,
00:12:47 aka Neo Milwaukee is America to me, because we have a lot of like regulations over here that
00:12:52 things like that just can't get on the shelves. And so it's cool just to hear like,
00:12:57 like bang stuff. It's a little bit of capitalism run wild.
00:13:01 You walk into the 7 11 and everything on the shelves has a skull and crossbones on the
00:13:06 body. Yeah, I mean, I don't it's literally like, you know, how like, like, like poisonous frogs
00:13:11 and like insects will have a bright packet of bright coloring on them. Yeah, it's like that.
00:13:16 Every single thing I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know if you heard,
00:13:19 but bang energy drink has been shown to to reverse retardation.
00:13:24 It has to be super cringy and fucking Britbong. Yeah.
00:13:30 Wait, it's that would that would just be called Tardation.
00:13:35 I mean, in America, we consume so much food that induces retardation that we have to
00:13:42 count it. We have no choice but to counterbalance it. I'm going to copyright my own energy drink,
00:13:46 Brandon. It's going to be called Tardation. Oh, no way. We can't call it what in Tardation.
00:13:51 That should be the full. And it's going to be and it's going to be like an off brand Yosemite
00:13:55 Sam on the label. It's like a legally distinct Yosemite Sam. Yeah, it's like a sasperilla.
00:14:01 It's like brood and barrels. Yeah, he's just he's just going to be called Simity Sam.
00:14:07 Everybody working on the PCP dating sim. Take notes. Fuck energy. This being the cafeteria
00:14:13 in the deal. Fuck it. The official drink of New Los Angeles. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
00:14:17 Yeah. It's just it's just it's just it's just as fuck with a skull and crossbones.
00:14:25 It's like a skull and crossbones with their dollar signs in the skeleton's eyes.
00:14:31 But there's also like the nuclear like nuclear radioactivity. There's like like the chemical.
00:14:36 There's like the chemical warning, you know, like the four diamonds. Yeah.
00:14:40 It's super creative. There's ultra creatine two, 3D. Hold on. I'm going to post the chemical
00:14:46 warning diamond thing. Okay, good. I want to see that. It's it's like four quat. It's like it
00:14:51 literally looks like the the the the Steven Universe diamonds, diamonds, the diamond hierarchy,
00:14:57 whatever it's called. And it's like it's like four quadrants. And each one has like a number
00:15:02 or a letter in it that determines like in what in which specific ways is this environment hazardous
00:15:07 to you. Perhaps this is room for an epic New Los Angeles City Steven Universe crossover event
00:15:12 where the diamonds are the ones supplying this particular beverage, you know, involved in the
00:15:16 production. I've been looking for I've been looking for an excuse. I've been looking for an excuse.
00:15:19 Here we go. I'm posting it in gross disgusting audio. Okay, good, good, good. Yeah, here we go.
00:15:24 Oh, yeah, okay. Asbestos materials classification diamond. There you go. Damn, this is sick.
00:15:30 My hands on that. I died. Dude, dude, dude. No, no, no. It's that diamond. But in in in each of
00:15:36 the quadrants, it says N. L. A. C. Oh, that's good. That is pretty good. Yeah. Also, you could
00:15:43 just in the middle of each of them just have a middle finger just pointing to you will just or
00:15:48 or just like or just more dollar signs. God, yeah, that feels so good to be an energy drink warrior
00:15:53 where you can walk into your arsenal, aka your fridge and just pick from any of your many arm
00:15:57 armaments. It's like, okay, like a monster is like the basically everyone gets a monster to start out
00:16:02 with. It's like the skill floor. It's it's it's like the you know, everyone has that's the freedom
00:16:09 dividend. Exactly. Exactly. Everyone gets like a month's supply of monster energy at the beginning
00:16:14 of this war chest. It's like when it's like when Neo and Trinity are going to save Morpheus and Neo is
00:16:20 just like give me energy drinks. Lots of energy drinks. Have you ever seen that famous overlord
00:16:26 gift where there's like the skeleton man just casting like spell after spell like buffing
00:16:30 spells like greater dexterity. Yeah, and magic prow. And like it's a million those just like
00:16:34 chugs like a monster, you know, zero energy chugs of bang chugs, you know, rain, etc. etc.
00:16:40 just so many fucking just glowing brighter and brighter with like more like more and more particle
00:16:45 effects just like collect until you're just like a blob. You just like a light a luminous
00:16:50 like slightly shifting and has different hues. They're just rating out like you just you look
00:16:55 like a like like from a distance like from like miles away, you look through a telescope and you
00:16:59 see like a black hole with like a like an accretion disk like orbiting around you and you're like
00:17:03 spewing out like heated superheated particles from your axes. Mixing all these energy drinks
00:17:10 is like is like when Guy opens up the eight gates, the eight chakra gates. Yeah, that's the one.
00:17:16 Your fucking aura keeps changing colors because you're like seeping out. Tell me who just finished
00:17:20 Naruto at the end of the day. And then you're just fucked afterwards. Yeah, and then you fucking
00:17:25 die at the end. You fucking die at the end. Pretty much everyone agrees that that Guy moment was
00:17:29 like the highlight of like late game Naruto. Do you agree? Yeah, it was the fucking greatest
00:17:35 shit because like and when when Madara says you are the greatest Taijutsu user of all time. God,
00:17:41 that felt good. Everyone was hype as shit. By the way, by the way, Tom, I'm just curious.
00:17:46 While Naruto came up, I'll never talk about Naruto ever again, but I'm curious. My favorite moment
00:17:51 of of late game Naruto, it was truly the peak. It was it was a return to form. It was an escalation.
00:17:56 It was a it was a a fucking resurrection of a great old meme. It was that moment where Naruto
00:18:02 attempted to use sexy nojutsu on Kaguya. Did you love that? It was the best moment of like
00:18:08 arguably the whole series. Yes, it was so funny. Thank you. I watched a lot of Naruto in my late
00:18:15 teen years, but I never never made it that far into Shippuden. I got to I got to a filler arc and
00:18:23 something about that's why I watch I watched Naruto Kai. Everyone, if you want to get through
00:18:28 this, you got to watch Naruto Kai. It's a fan. I didn't know they made all the filler. They cut out
00:18:34 a ton of like the flashbacks that are pointless. Yeah. And it cuts it down to just
00:18:40 72. Yeah, it's it's all it's all. It's not even that bad. Each each episode is like 90 minutes
00:18:47 because it's like oh each each episode is a volume of the manga in anime. Damn. That's so that that
00:18:54 sounds really good. I might actually watch some of that. It's worth doing. It's worth doing. Is
00:18:58 that an official release or is this a fan thing? This is a fan thing. Okay. Okay. Yeah, so that's
00:19:03 like Dragon Ball Z Kai was a thing. Wait, wait, wait, Jesse, wait, rewind the tapes. Rewind the
00:19:08 tapes. Jesse, what did you just say? I said, I said, don't don't don't do it. Oh my Naruto. Shit.
00:19:25 That's what I thought. It feels weird having everyone jack off and suck off and just titillate
00:19:33 over a specific show that you've never seen before in your entire life. I feel like I
00:19:38 have not watched any of the same thing any of you have ever or played in the same thing. I don't
00:19:43 know. Sly Cooper could be a rat for all I care. No idea. No idea who a fucking Spyro is. Who's a
00:19:51 Spyro to me? It's a Spy Pyro. It's a Spy disguised as a Spyro. You don't know Spyro? That can't
00:19:56 be right. Do you really not know Spyro? I know. I know who Spyro is. I've never played a single
00:19:59 game of his. Oh my god. Okay. Okay. Okay. Complete understanding of Spyro. Spyro is a dragon and
00:20:04 there's a bear and he has money. Here's the here's the problem. Here's the problem. To Munchy,
00:20:09 the original PlayStation is a retro console. That's not even true though. Fucking kill this guy.
00:20:18 Well, okay. Well, okay. It's sort of true. Like for like, I think like my like my like eighth
00:20:22 birthday or something. I don't even remember. But I told my mom like, Hey, I want a PlayStation
00:20:26 because I saw my brother's PlayStation too. And she was like, I'm on it. And it was really nice
00:20:30 of her but she got me an original PlayStation. Listen, you fucking jackoff. Get the fuck on my
00:20:35 level and play fucking tennis for two on your fucking oscilloscope. You coward. I'm gonna play
00:20:40 fucking Sony All Stars battle racing. I've never played that before. You can't play that on an
00:20:46 oscilloscope. You can't play Smash Bros on an oscilloscope. Fuck you. Hey, if you try hard enough.
00:20:52 I just speaking of video games, I just want to share with you. I posted something in the
00:20:55 gross discussing audio links chat. So now that I say Kingdom Hearts 2, what final makes best
00:21:00 game ever? So right, it's still still true. But get this, someone just released a release a mod.
00:21:06 There's a link in the description or whatever, you'll see it. It's it's a it's basically a full
00:21:10 remake of Kingdom Hearts 2 final mix by a fan where you instead of playing a Sora, you play as
00:21:15 Vanitas, which is like evil Sora from birth by sleep, essentially. And he's got all new moves.
00:21:21 He's got like an all new setup. And it's like a totally new thing that a bunch of fans just made
00:21:26 because they love the game so much. And I'm probably going to stream it at some point.
00:21:30 And I was just, this is the greatest game ever, but it was tragically locked on a console. But
00:21:36 now that like emulators have like enabled people to, you know, fuck things up and make it free
00:21:41 and loosey goosey, you can make something like this. And it's just really, really sick. Really
00:21:47 sick. Actually, it's interesting you mentioned that because like I just found out recently that
00:21:50 there was a there's a mod for the PC release of Devil May Cry 3 that adds style switching. So
00:21:55 you can play, oh really, which is fucking sick. So I kind of want to try that roster of PlayStation
00:22:00 All Stars. Look at the roster of this. I've literally not played a single game that any of
00:22:06 these cages besides right besides right. The PlayStation All Stars lineup is like the worst
00:22:10 in history. No one likes any of these characters. I wouldn't know. I wouldn't even know. I wouldn't
00:22:15 even know. It has like two or three of games that like Ratchet and Clank, Jack and Dexter and
00:22:21 Sly and then maybe one other one. I mean, didn't they add Dante to this game, but it was Dante from
00:22:26 like DMC Devil May Cry? Oh, they might have. I'm pretty sure that's real. It is. I'm looking at it
00:22:33 right now. Oh yeah, there he is. I see Dante, D-O-N-T, Dante. Oh, I like, okay, I like Jack,
00:22:40 Jack and Dexter. Cool. Like, but like they're like main guys are like Sackboy, Sly Cooper,
00:22:48 I don't know, Toro, you know what the fuck is that?
00:22:50 We'll never stop being hilarious.
00:22:53 Yeah, Cole and Evil Cole. I mean, I guess there's a lot of links in Smash.
00:22:58 I'm just like, this is a shit lineup we all know that.
00:23:00 It's so lame. Like, it just feels so lame and forced and gay and shit.
00:23:04 It's because they, that princess.
00:23:07 Yeah, what? Like, I've always felt like PlayStation had its peak in PS2. I mean,
00:23:14 a lot of people would agree with that. And with the PS3, because it was like pushing
00:23:20 graphical capabilities as what everything was at the time, that was like the thing of the day.
00:23:25 Oh my god. They went to make like, look at how realistically we can render this human being,
00:23:30 and then everything they made was with human beings. And so they have no characters that are
00:23:35 different from each other. Nathan Drake's just got a gun. He's just a guy with a gun.
00:23:39 He's just a guy with a gun. You don't want to play a fighting game with a guy with a gun.
00:23:43 That's stupid. People would be like, what about Snake? I mean,
00:23:46 Well, Snake's not even in here. And Snake would be right in here.
00:23:49 Okay, so Riden isn't here. Riden's sick.
00:23:52 I gotta say, okay, so I have, I started to feel a little weird for a second there.
00:23:57 I looked it up. Turns out a spike hardcore energy. Okay, it, okay. So first warning sign.
00:24:03 Warning sign. On the back, it does not have nutrition facts. It has supplement facts.
00:24:08 Turns out it has like three times the caffeine of a monster. Oh, okay.
00:24:15 Okay, so I'm gonna slow down on that. Good idea. Chug it, chug it, chug it, chug it.
00:24:23 It's spike hardcore energy supplements. It's totally, all right, all right.
00:24:28 You know, I forget what it is, but it's primarily marketed to bodybuilders.
00:24:34 Michelle's mom is both like an alcoholic, seemingly, and like a weird energy drink,
00:24:40 like freak. So she will just drink, if I remember correctly. So she's a four loco gal.
00:24:46 Absolutely. Absolutely. And it's truly a fascinating creature in that human being.
00:24:52 Imagine stuffing your body full of a depressant and then full of a stimulant over and over and over
00:24:57 and over again. That's the only way to live. You gotta force balance. Force balance.
00:25:02 Yes. If you can't find it. Perfectly balances all things should be used to destroy your body.
00:25:07 Insert that meme. Dave Chappelle, modern problems require modern solutions.
00:25:13 That's relatively appropriate. By the way, shout out to Kat, the sexy gravity rush girl who's a DLC
00:25:19 character in PlayStation All Stars. Honestly, seeing that one character, it makes me want to go
00:25:23 look up gameplay because Kat is cool. Anyway, that's it. That's all I have to say about that.
00:25:27 Video games are sort of weird in a way where it's like everyone can more or less watch the same
00:25:32 movie, you know, they can just go to the movies, which everyone is like it's almost like a public
00:25:38 venue that anyone can go to. But video games, they're like super fucking locked behind like a
00:25:44 pretty big upfront commitment where it's like there's no way I really could have played some of
00:25:49 these games unless I was going to not play the other games I play because you know, you can't
00:25:52 really have that many multiple systems or at least I couldn't, you know.
00:25:56 Well, Munchy, it sounds like you, like so many of our brethren in the journalism field,
00:26:02 demand to be able to get through games without putting any time commitment in,
00:26:06 without putting any effort to learn the mechanics. I know you're not saying that, I'm just making fun
00:26:10 of that. Okay, there's been a thing recently with Sekiro being too hard for baby journalists.
00:26:15 Literally don't even know what Sekiro is. I have an opinion about that. Yeah, I don't like it.
00:26:21 I think a game, I think a game should be fucking hard if it wants to be fucking hard. And
00:26:27 well, yeah, I mean, most of us would be in agreement. Are we, are we, are we on agreement?
00:26:31 Yeah, I think we would all agree. I did, I did read a couple of the articles about that that I
00:26:36 saw. I wouldn't, I wouldn't be, I wouldn't say I wouldn't be against Sekiro having an easy mode,
00:26:41 but I'm not going to cry like it's not fair because people can't experience all the content
00:26:46 if they don't give it one. That's stupid. That's what they're doing, basically.
00:26:51 I don't know. There's like an article about, about like the accessibility written by a person who
00:26:58 has like a lot of physical ailments that cause their muscles to spaz out and seize up and it
00:27:04 hurts a lot. And it's like the, you know, the Sekiro is the big, the hot big game and it's,
00:27:10 he tries his best and he feels like, you know, it's possible, but it's really hurts and it sucks.
00:27:16 But he, he wasn't like advocating for making an easy mode. He was just explaining that accessibility
00:27:23 does not mean like, like literally making a baby version of the game as a mode. It's like things
00:27:32 I, I can't remember off the top of my head, but it was just very like,
00:27:35 What does he want is my, is my, I mean, I mean, what I'm, I thought people were being like,
00:27:40 this game should have an easy mode. Like that was the thing I came away with was that
00:27:47 you know, the people who write these articles, because I've read the article and it was like,
00:27:50 you know what, I can see your point and it was a good point. I can't remember exactly, but you
00:27:56 know, he wasn't an idiot and he was like giving, you know, I would agree with him on a lot of what
00:28:01 he said. And then everybody who saw that, you know, saw that thing tweeted in the, in the tweet
00:28:08 replies were replying to some nebulous idea of what the article was about and instead of actually
00:28:14 reading it, and it just really made me annoyed because of course, of course, nobody would
00:28:18 actually read the articles to understand what was being said. Nobody does that. And then I
00:28:22 realized that everything sucks. Yeah, so we have here, so we have here is, everything does suck.
00:28:28 So we have here is a spiral of fake news where someone, where someone makes like a moderate
00:28:33 take, someone, people misinterpret it and spread it around as like, this person thinks this
00:28:39 ridiculous thing and then it just becomes accepted in the zeitgeist that people are saying this
00:28:44 ridiculous thing. Fuck them. Like what are they stupid? Let's be slightly more charitable because
00:28:49 I think that that could definitely be the root of it. But like as the conversation swirls into a
00:28:54 more and more like toxic storm, I do think that like, at any one moment, like in that storm that
00:29:01 starts at that beginning of that conversation that may or may not be justified, within that storm,
00:29:05 there are like battles that are, you know, relatively reasonable. Like, I mean, I saw
00:29:09 a tweet from somebody before that was basically saying like, like, what is it that like, you're
00:29:14 really risking by like, basically they were, they were, this person was like, defending the idea that
00:29:20 like, why are you being so elitist about like, accomplishment in games? Like, what are you even
00:29:26 like, risking by, you know, having this high level of like failure that you might not get over. And
00:29:31 so they were kind of like attacking the idea of like accomplishment in video games versus loss.
00:29:36 And so, I mean, I think that's a reasonable argument to have. And obviously, I'd come down on
00:29:41 the, I'm into, I am the gatekeeper, call me the gatekeeper, I want to keep the gate and keep the
00:29:47 hacks out who can't hack it. I don't think that like, they're being an easy mode would like,
00:29:53 cheapen the hard mode, or something. I mean, it depends on how it's implemented, I'd say. And
00:29:59 I think it kind of, I would say it certainly can. Well, I don't think it necessarily would,
00:30:05 because like, I've been thinking about this a lot, because like, I, I've been trying to play
00:30:08 Sekiro, and I can't really get into it. Big surprise, I can't really get into any of the
00:30:12 Soulsborne games or any of, any of, any of FromSoft's work for the most part. And I'm trying
00:30:17 to like parse why, like why I'm just like, not a fan of these games. And I mean, and then this
00:30:24 discussion came up, and I was thinking about it, I'm like, yeah, I would enjoy Sekiro more if it
00:30:28 was easier. I think the hard, the difficulty, because like, my whole thing with games is that I
00:30:33 just don't want to spend the time getting that good, because I'd rather spend that time doing
00:30:39 other things and games. But there's the difference right there. Right. But like, here's the thing,
00:30:43 even with that perspective, I don't think it should have an easy mode, even if that excludes me from
00:30:47 having fun with it, because I respect the interest of the artist and what they're trying to create,
00:30:56 right. And like FromSoft clearly wants to make a title that is like, ball bustingly hard, like
00:31:00 that's the idea. And to change that. If you don't want the game to be hard, I mean, I can see your
00:31:06 perspective, because I kind of share it sometimes, because it's just us being old. Like when you're
00:31:10 kids, you have time to play a hard game, and you have time to master it. And when you're old,
00:31:13 you don't have time to give a shit so much. But like, if you're, if you work at like a
00:31:19 games journalism website, and your only job is to play games, that excuse goes out the fucking
00:31:24 window. I mean, I think there's a lot of overlap with like, well, I'm not even trying to like,
00:31:29 bait political stuff. But I just mean, I think there's a lot of like, literal advocacy that
00:31:33 come that they people perceive their job to be when you are a games journalist, they think like,
00:31:36 I need to make games for everyone. And you know, I don't know if that does, I don't know if that,
00:31:42 I mean, because if you're a games journalist, you got to play a lot of games. Like, yeah,
00:31:46 you think they'd be the best at games. I mean, you would think so. But yeah, but like, they can't
00:31:52 spend the week, they can't spend a whole week mastering their fucking counter attacks and
00:31:55 second row. They got to fucking play the next, they got to play the next fucking marble match,
00:32:01 fucking match three fucking, as far as I know, the greatest games journalist in the world,
00:32:06 in my humble opinion, is super bunny hop, because he does exactly that he has committed himself
00:32:11 on a deep level. It's like, you got those like roaming like war journalists who like go to like,
00:32:16 you know, the fucking conflict zone between like Palestine and Israel, and like talking to both
00:32:20 sides and like, could be killed in a moment's notice if they do something bad. But that like
00:32:24 super bunny hop is the equivalent of that with video games by 100% in Metal Gear Solid 5.
00:32:31 That is very cool that he did that. But that's not really equivalent, because that would be
00:32:36 like a war journalist reporting on, you know, news from like eight months ago, that there's no war
00:32:41 anymore. Like bunny hop takes his time, right? It's not like Metal Gear Solid 5 disappeared.
00:32:46 We got to put an endless war, Nate Bestman. No, I would never say that.
00:32:51 Journalists that like have to, you know, be timely with the thing, because the games out and people
00:32:56 want to know, is it good? Is it good? Somebody is going to fill that niche. Somebody is gonna have
00:33:00 to. And I'm not saying that the journalist has to be really good at the game, but I've read articles
00:33:06 by things like on IGN, where people are like going apeshit, there's the same thing as before,
00:33:10 they're going apeshit that, you know, they assume that the IGN guy doesn't play the game enough and
00:33:15 he's stupid. And he says, I don't play, didn't play this game for that long. And here's the problems
00:33:20 I found with it. But also, he understood, like, in the articles, they would, they would say that
00:33:27 they hadn't played the game for as long as they could have. Yeah, yeah. They put that in their
00:33:32 score and in their review. As long as they're transparent about it, like, what's the problem?
00:33:39 They're like, yeah, I played 10 hours of this game. Here's my impressions after 10 hours of it. You
00:33:44 know, I mean, what's what's the complaint about this? There's no problem with that inherently. I
00:33:48 would say just like the issue as it arrives is not with them, but it's that like, when people are
00:33:53 looking for information on a game, and maybe if you're someone who has put in like 80 hours,
00:33:58 100% of the game or whatever, and then you you you were just annoyed to see like, this is the review
00:34:03 of an incomplete, you know, playthrough of the game, like literally didn't even beat it, let alone
00:34:08 100% it. And yet this is the information people are taking away, which is why people like Super
00:34:12 Bunnyhop, those are the people you want to listen to. Not depending on who you are.
00:34:16 I would argue that Super Bunnyhop is made for people who have completed the game.
00:34:19 Yes, it depends. More so than for people who haven't even thought about buying the game,
00:34:22 because people who think about buying the game, they want information really quickly.
00:34:26 Yeah. You know, is it good? They just want to gauge like vague interest because they're
00:34:29 probably going to get it. They want to know whether it's like got a game breaking bug or
00:34:33 whether it sucks completely. Yeah. And if there's a review that says, yeah, it's pretty good, then
00:34:39 like, okay, good. I'll buy it. Yeah, it's the entire concept of reviews needing to have integrity
00:34:46 and needing to be helpful should just be done away with and thrown on the garbage because that's
00:34:50 bullshit. You don't watch a review to help you. You know what game you want. You know what you are
00:34:55 interested in playing. You watch your review because you want to hear a guy just talking
00:34:58 about a game and just sharing his thoughts. That's all should be this guy's talking about
00:35:02 games. It should be okay to be wrong. It should be okay to just fucking talk out of your ass.
00:35:06 You don't need to play the fucking game. I don't care. I also don't really understand. Like,
00:35:11 I also don't have the perspective of like, I go to a review to like get like be informed about
00:35:17 what kind of a product to make a decision about buying. I don't yeah, I don't do that. But my
00:35:23 understanding is that people do it. And you know, I just have to take people's word on this one.
00:35:29 Like, like these reviewers should be rising up and saying, no, we're not at fault for making
00:35:35 stupid reviews. You're at fault for being so stupid. You need reviews to tell you what fucking
00:35:39 game you want. You're at fault for basing your buying decisions on our stupid reviews. Yeah,
00:35:44 here's a real question. Here's a real question. What are the actual consequences of any of this?
00:35:49 Like, are people being led astray really? Is that even happening? Or is the issue that people like
00:35:55 me, elitist assholes, just see journalists with an opinion we don't like or like a not completely
00:36:02 informed one because they haven't like 100% of the game or whatever. Is that really the
00:36:05 consequence? Are the stakes are the stakes just you being annoyed or someone being annoyed by the
00:36:10 review itself? That's probably it. Yeah, probably. And so yeah, I mean, we should just do what Gib says
00:36:15 and either like, actually read the whole thing and have like the full context of okay, you know,
00:36:20 he says the only play 10 hours, whatever, or like, just don't get mad by it. The problem I think is
00:36:27 headlines. The problem when I see a headline that says, Sekiro needs to respect its players by
00:36:32 adding an easy mode. That was a literal headline. It just makes me mad. I think that article was
00:36:37 actually exactly what it looked like. Okay, well, that's another article afterwards that I read,
00:36:43 which was well, that's objection because the implication obviously is that Sekiro does not
00:36:50 respect its players, because it did not add an easy mode. And I mean, respect can mean a lot
00:36:55 of different things. And so that's where you have to get into the nuance of, well, what do you mean
00:36:58 by respect? I mean, obviously it means like cater to probably it's less capable fans. I don't
00:37:04 understand this idea that people have that any game is actually hard at all. Like they're not.
00:37:11 Well, they do dude. So I'm with you on that. And I've got two examples to show. One is a video of
00:37:17 a quadriplegic beating one of the harder bosses in Sekiro a quadriplegic. And in this case,
00:37:24 what that means is he just has very limited usage of his limbs. He can actually move his hands a bit,
00:37:29 but he is a technical quadriplegic with barely any function in his hands. And he shows he still
00:37:36 beats this boss in Sekiro. Like no game is hard compared to like the constant moral quandary
00:37:43 and crushing existential pain of life. So like if you think that any game is hard, you obviously
00:37:49 have no life and you haven't lived, you're a fucking stupid poopy baby. That's like, because
00:37:54 fucking people are all you hear about Dark Souls is like, Oh, Dark Souls is a hard game. Or, you
00:38:00 know, every year there's a new game that comes out. That's the hard game like Cuphead that all
00:38:05 anyone the only talking point about it is how hard it is. Like none of these games are hard. You're
00:38:09 all full of shit. Like, well, Jesse, you know what it is? You know what it is? The reason they say
00:38:14 this, when I hear they say like, I want an easy mode for this game, what I hear is this exactly
00:38:19 what here is, I do not want to have to devote the time required to complete these challenges.
00:38:25 Like, is Dark Souls even hard? I don't get it. What is hard about Dark Souls? It's like,
00:38:30 you fucking roll and you're invincible the whole time you're rolling. That's it. You have to learn
00:38:34 the system, dude. It's literally bullying to force them to have to learn the mechanics of the game
00:38:39 to get through it. It's such a disservice to these games in a way. We're like Cuphead or
00:38:46 Dark Souls. They're beautiful games in their own right. Oh, yeah. It's like, there's so much there
00:38:51 to talk about with Cuphead with Dark Souls, like just ranging from like themes to just like Cuphead,
00:38:57 like you could have an entire discussion about the art style or just the way it was made and the
00:39:01 interesting story there. But just for some reason, this one aspect of the game, which I don't even
00:39:07 know if it was intentional in Dark Souls case, maybe it was. But it's not the main point of the
00:39:13 game. So why is it the main talking point? I mean, I guess because it's the stopper that
00:39:20 keeps people from experiencing more of it. That was less the game. Ultimately, people want
00:39:26 everyone, somebody who likes Dark Souls wants as many people as possible to play it and enjoy it
00:39:32 because they like it so much. And so when there's this idea going around that Dark Souls is too hard,
00:39:39 in their brain, I think, you know, they probably wouldn't realize. But I think it's this, they get
00:39:44 angry about that because it implies that more people will not even give it a chance and not even try
00:39:51 and not even go through the pain to feel the euphoria that they felt when they finally beat
00:39:56 the hard boss. And they want, they want to share the enjoyment of the game. It comes out in this
00:40:01 vitriolic sort of back and forth with, you know, game journalists and, and get gooders and all this
00:40:08 stupid internet internet fighting. And it's like, you just want to you just like video games. There's
00:40:14 a lot. I mean, there's a lot. It's hard. Let me let me let me be good if you could calm down, everyone.
00:40:18 Let me quote this guy. He says, there's a lot of talk about quote respecting the player when it
00:40:23 comes to not including an easy mode, an idea that all players can and should play the game in this
00:40:28 particular punishing way. Yet I think the lack of an easy mode showcases the exact opposite.
00:40:33 It shows an almost stunning lack of respect for players with the idea that they cannot be trusted
00:40:38 with their own gameplay experience, that even those who want a challenging game would somehow
00:40:42 be lured by the siren song of lower difficulties and destroy their own experience because they're
00:40:46 too impatient or immature to know what they actually want. But I mean, that has happened to me. It has
00:40:51 affected me when playing games. I mean, yeah, my argument. Yeah, I remember now that I read this
00:40:56 one and my had my my fundamental disagreement was that I don't think gamers can be respected.
00:41:04 I think I think that there's an ED mode. It's an ED mode. They will go for it because they go to
00:41:10 video games to escape. If there's a difficult section and they had a bad day and they're playing
00:41:15 a hard game and there's a way that they can just make it easier, of course, they're going to take
00:41:20 it. This is this is dark souls race. Remember the Dark Souls race that we did? Yeah. So like the
00:41:26 the Dark Souls race was great. Obviously, everybody go watch it on the procrastiners channel that
00:41:30 you're viewing right now. And like I won and that was really great. But but the thing about that was
00:41:36 like what I wanted to do with that and with the Pokemon race that we did afterward,
00:41:40 I would it was you guys were there, you know, I was like, guys, we need to set the rules because
00:41:46 once the rules are set, I will exploit every ability I can find within the rule set so that I
00:41:53 have not broken the rules, but I can use every possible tool and gimmick and glitch that is
00:41:59 allowed under the rule set to win. So it's so important to set the rules so that you know what
00:42:04 you like are and are allowed to do. And I like I just think this is a pretty good way to do that if
00:42:11 that's what the developer wants to do, which from soft has said they do, which is just say this is
00:42:16 the baseline of everybody. These are the rules. You can't obviously like cheat the game unless you
00:42:20 use like a cheat engine or something. So was it level here? Was it? Did Matthew Matosis do a video
00:42:27 about fucking? What's the game where you're a guy in a pot and you go in the mountain getting over
00:42:33 it? Yeah, did Matthew Matosis do a video about that one? I don't think so. No, I did a video about
00:42:39 that one. True. Am I thinking of Joseph Anderson or probably probably. Yeah. Okay. Well, I don't
00:42:48 know, like, if it was Joseph Anderson than him, but if it was someone else, whatever, whoever I'm
00:42:53 thinking of said like, there's, you know, there's something kind of beautiful about the idea that
00:42:58 this mountain is a totally, there's no easy mode for this and there couldn't be. Because like the
00:43:05 mountain change the game, the mountain is what it is. It is a series of set obstacles that you
00:43:10 either can or cannot overcome. And everyone who climbs this mountain climbs the exact same mountain.
00:43:17 That's exactly what it is in this case. That's exactly what Sekiro is. It's a mountain. And I
00:43:21 think that's fine. And I think that's cool. And no, I don't think it's fucking disrespectful
00:43:25 to be like, this is the exact experience I designed. And, you know, I don't think I'm going to want to
00:43:31 let people change it and play it in a different way. I think that's, that's the thing. And forgive
00:43:35 me, I haven't been talking this whole time because some asshole is like mowing his lawn or some
00:43:39 shit. It's fucking loud. I want to get picked up on the microphone. But yeah, I mean, it's interesting,
00:43:45 Nate, that you said that like you've been tempted to go to lower difficulties because like,
00:43:50 I paradoxically want games to be easy because I don't want to like spend a ton of time with
00:43:55 them. I just want to like escape from my life and have fun and feel cool. But every time I can't
00:44:02 go to easy mode on any game because it infuriates me. It makes me feel like a pathetic bitch because
00:44:07 I rarely like there's some games that like if you fail enough, the game will offer to like lower
00:44:13 the difficulty or whatever. And it feels like a slap in the face. I mean, it does, but I have done
00:44:18 it on occasion when like the game is just, I'm against the wall. To me, when it does that, it's
00:44:22 just it like quadruples down my efforts. I'm like, I will, I will never take you up on this offer.
00:44:28 You disgusting mongoloid of a developer who put this line of code in here. How dare you insult me?
00:44:34 I personally, I personally, I can't even go ahead. Oh, well, a perfect example of that is like
00:44:42 whenever I'm in playing in Minecraft and I've got survival on because that's default and there's
00:44:46 monsters around. I'm doing stuff. And then, uh-oh, there's like, I'm trapped. There's things all
00:44:50 around me. Paul's turned it to peaceful. All the mobs go away and I could just continue building
00:44:56 what I was building. Yeah. I do that all the time. I was playing Super Smash Bros. Ultimate World of
00:45:04 Light and I had it on hard just because I thought I usually play games on hard. I like when things
00:45:08 are difficult, but I think it's almost a sign of like when a game isn't good, then you want it to
00:45:14 be easy just to get it over with in a way. It feels to me when you just want things to be easy. It's
00:45:19 just because you just want to have it be done as fast as possible, which is not how I usually want
00:45:24 to play a game. So like with Super Smash Bros, it was like, I played it on hard for a while and I
00:45:31 thought, well, this game sucks and I'm not really having that much fun and I don't really care about
00:45:35 continuing. So I always turn it to easy and try and crank through it. And even still, if you
00:45:40 effort was on easy, I was like, oh, this is just too much. I don't fucking care anymore. It's a lot.
00:45:43 Yeah. I haven't beaten it either. I personally can't stand when a game even gives me a choice in
00:45:48 difficulty. There should be one option and that should be how the game is meant to be played.
00:45:52 Because when I see like easy, medium, and hard, you know, it's like, well, what the fuck is the
00:45:56 real game? What is the actual game? Is it normal? So I usually just pick normal. But that's if there's
00:46:01 like three. Sometimes games get crazy and they have like six different difficulty modes. And
00:46:06 there's no middle option because there's like an even number. So you don't know like what the real
00:46:10 game even is. And I don't want to have to think about that shit. I don't want to sweat the petty
00:46:14 things. Just give me the game how it's meant to be fucking played. One fucking difficulty mode.
00:46:18 Don't give me a choice. Don't make me fucking think about it. I hate you. All game developers die.
00:46:24 That is ideal, which is why I like Securo and Dark Souls so much.
00:46:27 Yeah. And it's like another thing that annoys me about multiple difficulty modes at the beginning
00:46:32 is that I have a choice to make. And it's like if I choose easy, then the game might not be
00:46:38 challenging or interesting enough. So I usually don't choose easy. But if I choose normal,
00:46:43 and I'm like locked into it, or like hard, and I'm locked into it. I feel like I if I get stuck
00:46:50 at any point, I'm like, ah, I should have picked easy. Yeah, I got to restart the game because I
00:46:56 I'm not having an easy time. But there's a possibility that I could be having an easy time
00:47:01 if I had done the other thing. There's a handful of games that I've ever been like, I would prefer
00:47:06 to play this on easy. Have you guys seen that extra credits video on the true genius of Dark Souls
00:47:12 two? I don't wait. Yes. And I think I remember. So fucking dumb. Yeah, terrible. Okay, basically.
00:47:24 Okay, well, the idea of the video is that Dark Souls two lets you basically sort of soft set
00:47:31 your own difficulty. But like the key argument for it basically boils down to magic is way
00:47:38 overpowered in the game. So if you're having a hard time, just use magic and then the game
00:47:43 will be easier for you. And I disagree with that in the grounds of Have you seen the adventures
00:47:49 of Baba Duke spook? His life is suffering. He is a pure mage. He only does magic and his life is
00:47:55 constant agony. That's true. Well, a lot of that's of his own making. I don't know. They're fucking
00:48:02 wrong. That video is terrible. It's like, Hey, embarrassing. And this whole discussion of like
00:48:07 difficulty of Dark Souls, like everything makes sense so far. But but the thing is there's there's
00:48:12 games that are just fundamentally designed differently. And I think one of those like is
00:48:16 Devil May Cry. Because personally, I've never done this. Yeah, like I intend to with Devil May Cry
00:48:20 and maybe I'll go back. I've beaten all the games and basically a scrub. But like I understand that
00:48:25 the idea of those games is you basically get through them once. And then you go back and you do it on
00:48:29 like hard mode, and then Dante must die mode. And you try to like get, you know, triple s rank on
00:48:34 like every individual level or whatever. And so it's about like perfecting your gameplay and,
00:48:39 you know, upping your score. So that's kind of like a totally different approach to like how
00:48:44 difficulty should be handled, because that's a game designed to be played many times over and
00:48:48 over by the most committed. I really like rank systems, ranking systems, because is this is
00:48:55 exact same thing? Like, it's difficult to do an s rank, but you don't need to do an s rank to get
00:49:03 to the next part of the game. So you can beat the game with a low rank score, and you can see
00:49:09 everything there is to see. But if, you know, the challenge is always there. And, you know,
00:49:15 in Dark Souls, if you kill the thing, that's it. There is no how well you did it, how many
00:49:19 times you dodged or, or like how many estus you didn't need to drink. It's like, you just do it,
00:49:25 and it doesn't matter whether you're, you were terrible during the fight and got lucky, or that
00:49:30 you killed it in like five seconds. And you can do like self-imposed challenges, but those are just
00:49:34 those are an outside thing that you, but like having having the rank system as like a tantalizing
00:49:39 Ooh, I want the shiny one. I want the shiny one. It makes you, you know, it gives you,
00:49:46 you know, the whole game, you can play the whole game and beat the whole game. But if you want to,
00:49:50 and if you feel inclined to, you can, you can train yourself to get better at it so that you
00:49:56 can beat the highest scores. And often I don't do that, but I just like the fact that that is,
00:50:01 that is a thing rather than just, rather than just cutting my gameplay experience short and
00:50:06 making me rage quit. I think that's why I end up liking Devil May Cry more is because like,
00:50:09 it feels like to me that like actually like being good at Devil May Cry is, you know, S ranking
00:50:16 everything. You know, and so like you have this like kind of like skill floor difficulty where
00:50:20 it's like getting through the game, but like the real way like you've actually quote unquote beaten
00:50:26 the game shirt for in all intents and purposes by S ranking everything. Like that's, that's kind of
00:50:31 like, you know, what you should optimally do. Like that's where you kind of the games clearly kind
00:50:36 of like designed to influence you to try and do that. Whereas with something like, like Dark Souls,
00:50:42 the different, the difficulty is like, to S rank it is to just beat it, you know, just fuck your
00:50:47 way. So like, so like that's why it's harder is that like it the S the skill floor of Dark Souls
00:50:53 is S ranking everything. So it's fair to I get complaining about a skill floor being too high
00:51:00 such that it's too much for a lot of people to get over. But then it just comes back to like,
00:51:04 I mean, another another thing I was entitled like why are you entitled to an experience?
00:51:08 People feel entitled. People really feel like here's another video in the girls discussing
00:51:12 audio links. This is a video made it's on the Street Fighter channel on YouTube made like three
00:51:18 years ago, whatever. And it's of the number one ranked Chun Li player in the world. And I think
00:51:23 Street Fighter five or maybe Street Fighter four, whatever. And like, he's got a like a terrible
00:51:28 debilitating disability. His legs don't work. He like crawls around and his arms have limited
00:51:32 functionality. And if you skip through this, like the way he plays is like he has his face on the
00:51:37 game pad and puts his hands like claw like behind it. So this guy had to come up with a whole new
00:51:42 way to play the game. He can't use an arcade stick. And still he became the number one ranked
00:51:46 Chun Li and placed like fifth in a professional tournament. So this guy just like he adapted
00:51:52 and overcame. I don't know if we should base our expectations for people on like clear. It is.
00:51:58 Yeah, it is. This is a man who he's living out his fantasies of having legs by playing as Chun Li
00:52:05 and her beautiful, ultimate legs, big, meaty legs. Yeah, the most leg of all. I'm just saying
00:52:10 this is like the ideal of what I would want people to aim.
00:52:17 You know, of what this guy has done seems. I just think the world will be better if people
00:52:22 approach challenges in this way. The problem, the real problem in all this, of course, once again,
00:52:28 comes down to zoomers. It's all young people's fault that we have these issues. I'm not sure.
00:52:34 And I'm going to tell you why. And this is okay. I mean, the guy who wrote this article is not a
00:52:39 zoomer. Well, it's going to sound slightly influenced. I believe the guy who wrote this
00:52:43 article, even if he's not technically a zoomer, he is a zoomer at heart. He is a young person at
00:52:48 his core because there's an epidemic of people who are not classically educated in video games.
00:52:55 Because what my point of view with saying that Dark Souls isn't hard, like is Dark Souls hard
00:53:00 compared to Ghouls and Ghosts? I don't think so. Is Sekiro hard compared to the original
00:53:06 Ninja Gaiden? No, not even close. These people have played, they haven't played these games.
00:53:11 They don't know what a real hard game is like. They don't know Shinobi 3. They don't know the
00:53:14 fucking Lion King. That's why I went into a rant about the Lion King in my last video. Because
00:53:19 the Lion King was the first video game I ever played. The first video game I ever beat. I was
00:53:23 like, fucking five years old. So I never thought of it as a hard game my whole life. And then
00:53:28 when I grew up and I, you know, you look on the internet, it seems like every other week
00:53:31 to this day on Reddit, there's a big thread like, anyone remember the Lion King is the hardest game
00:53:36 ever made? No one on earth could ever get past the second level. And it's like, what is wrong
00:53:42 with you people? I don't believe you. I don't believe these people have played it. I think they're
00:53:47 just copying the notion that it's the hardest game ever. In my humble opinion, the world and the
00:53:54 people in it have all softened. Because there's just less need to try harder things. People used
00:54:01 to be a lot tougher, you know, back in the day when we were all Nephilim, you know.
00:54:07 But before the flood. No game made nowadays is as hard as Splatterhouse 2. It's never gonna happen.
00:54:14 They'll never make a game again as hard as Splatterhouse 2. The final boss of Splatterhouse 2
00:54:19 will reduce you to a quivering, weeping mess. Anyone out there, you try it. You try to beat
00:54:25 the last boss of Splatterhouse 2. You'll cry and you'll scream. You'll break your controller in
00:54:29 half with your hands. You'll get Hulk strength just for that one moment. I tried to play Contra 4
00:54:34 on my DS when it came out. And I was like, this is so, there was no chance. No chance. I will
00:54:39 ever beat this game without cheating. And so I just gave up. So yeah. I don't know. And I feel
00:54:45 like I have some ability to say this stuff. Because like right now, I'm at the end of Hollow Knight
00:54:50 facing down like some of the like the final challenges to get like the uber super secret
00:54:54 ending. It is so, it asks so much of you. And by that, I mean, it asks about as much as like
00:55:01 level one of Contra 1 asked, you know, to get like the ultimate, probably a bit more than that.
00:55:06 But like still, it's such a hurdle to get the final shit in Hollow Knight. And I have not earned
00:55:11 it. And I don't want to be just given a participation trophy. I want to work up to it over the next,
00:55:17 I don't know, months or years, and then earn it. And like satisfaction will be, will be there.
00:55:22 But if Hollow Knight had an easy mode, I mean, that wouldn't be like,
00:55:28 I mean, would you take that away from, I mean, I mean, you would have to opt into being given it.
00:55:34 You would have to be like, okay, I'm doing it. I'm macing that Faustian bargain. I'm hitting,
00:55:38 I'm hitting the button. I have decided on that. Easy mode. Does easy mode in this in this mean
00:55:45 like the main game is has an easy mode, but then all the extra challenges don't have easy modes,
00:55:50 or would they also? Yeah, it depends on how it's done. Because a game like Kingdom Hearts 2, for
00:55:55 example, it has a it has easy modes, basically, that just make basically the whole game easier
00:55:59 and then hard modes that make a lot harder, etc. But like the way that it punishes you is that the
00:56:04 like, the criteria to unlock like secret ending content is it scales up like exponentially based
00:56:13 on how easy you've made the game. So like, I think if you plan beginner, you straight up can't
00:56:18 unlock the secret ending. I think I might be off about that. If you're playing on like normal,
00:56:23 you have to like 100% Jiminy's journal. If you're playing on like hard, you have to like, you know,
00:56:28 like do some secret like collect all the answer reports or something. And then if you're playing
00:56:32 on like critical mode, all you got to do is like beat the final boss. And then you get it.
00:56:35 Oh, this reminds me back back in the day when I played on Sega Genesis, Golden Axe.
00:56:41 Yeah, Sega Genesis, my first console, I had I had Golden Axe. I love that game. And me and me,
00:56:47 I would play it on on easy mode mostly just because I liked how you gave you more life and
00:56:51 stuff. Because like when you play, when you play Golden Axe on easy, like doubles your life bar,
00:56:55 gives you more, more lives and shit like that. And so you play the game. And I beat it. And I
00:57:00 beat it on easy mode. I'm like, Oh, this is a fun game. I like I like this game. It's cool. I played
00:57:04 a bunch of times like that. And then I remember the first time I played it on normal mode. And
00:57:07 as a little kid, I couldn't do it. But like a year into having the game, I played it on normal.
00:57:12 And I got to the end of the game. And I realized, Oh, this wasn't the end of the game. This is the
00:57:16 end of baby mode. There's like a whole other game after this that I never knew about. It blew
00:57:20 my mind to shit. It was fucking cool. Yeah, that's that's the shit. And like, I didn't, I watched,
00:57:28 I look at Sekiro, I haven't played it yet. So full disclosure, I haven't played it, but I watched
00:57:34 people playing it. And it just looks to me like a modern 10 shoe, basically, stealth and the grappling.
00:57:40 And it's like, I haven't played it yet. But I promise you that the original 10 shoe was harder
00:57:45 than Sekiro. That's no doubt. And it's just, there's different kinds of difficulty. I mean,
00:57:55 like when you talk about difficulty in games, it sort of becomes like either games are easier,
00:57:59 they're difficult, but there's so many different kinds. Like I have, I have, I have an easier
00:58:03 time with certain kinds of difficulty now than I used to and a harder time. Like, like the kind
00:58:08 of difficulty that like wears on my patience, I can't do anymore. Like when I was a kid, I had
00:58:12 all the patience in the world for it. But like, the difficulty that's just like, it's just there
00:58:18 and it's hard and you're doing it and you got to do it better. That's easy for me. Like anyone can
00:58:22 just do it and do it better each time. But like, you were talking about Hollow Knight, I played
00:58:27 Hollow Knight for a little while, I didn't beat it. Hollow Knight was kind of hard for me, just
00:58:31 because like, it all looked the same and I didn't know where to go and I had no patience for it.
00:58:37 I had no patience to explore this, this world because I got lost like Teminis and I'm like,
00:58:42 this game sucks, I hate it. Yeah, that'll happen. Yeah. I mean like, and it's not, I don't know if
00:58:48 it's a flaw of the game, like it sounds, maybe it is. The game starts with a particularly kind of
00:58:52 steep getting into a curve at the first like 20 minutes to an hour. I don't know if it like,
00:58:57 becomes more varied later on, but the first part of it, like every background looked the same and
00:59:01 I'm like, what, all these rooms are the same. I have no idea. Like at least with like Super Metroid,
00:59:06 every area has different music and different backgrounds. Some of the areas are more interesting
00:59:09 than others, for sure. Yeah, for sure, for sure. But I agree with Hollow Knight. I felt the same
00:59:17 way when I first played it too, which is captured on-stream during me and Mafia 1, so people can
00:59:21 go see it. Boy, I really gotta get back, I really gotta beat Hollow Knight. It's on my list of
00:59:28 shit I gotta get around to. We can all agree that, you know, games are hard, but nothing. No game is
00:59:34 more difficult than Team Fortress 2, because you're fighting in a multiplayer game. You're hunting
00:59:40 the most dangerous game of all, man. Yeah, because in multiplayer games, the skill ceiling will never
00:59:49 stop from getting higher. It will just keep going as players play the game for millions of hours and
00:59:54 they become super duper squads that completely destroy you. Until every single one of them is
00:59:59 basically Mario like glitch jumping up the like backwards, glitching up the infinite staircase.
01:00:08 Your skill set in a multiplayer game is social engineering that is legitimately one of the
01:00:13 skills you need to develop in order to be a proficient video game player in the multiplayer
01:00:18 scenario. Like when I hit 100 Charisma, what I realized, I could just go up and yell at the
01:00:23 competitors on the other side of the room to intimidate them into just giving up and leaving.
01:00:27 That's what I knew. I'd unlocked maximum gameplay skill. When you're not playing as part of a
01:00:32 professional group or even just playing with your friends exclusively, when you are matchmaking
01:00:36 online with maybe just one of your friends or even just alone, you will have people on your team in
01:00:41 any video game that you play, multiplayer, you know, shooter or whatever, that are shit. And you
01:00:47 have to figure out how to make them effective if you want to win. You can make your people,
01:00:55 it will often be said that, you know, you're just kind of fucked, you know, oh, my team was
01:00:58 sucked so bad. It's so bad. But literally, you just got to carry or you got to be able to tell them
01:01:04 what to do in ways that they understand. You got to be able to make them better. That's part of
01:01:09 how you have to play the game or to accomplish. It's literally a skill. It's like I've had like
01:01:18 the most like angry, angry gamer moments of all time where I like gnashed my teeth.
01:01:24 I've been witness to them. It was weird. It's very weird that you weren't really,
01:01:29 HIPAA's not very an angry guy. But for some reasons, TF2 just unlocks something that's
01:01:34 primal. It just makes me go fucking primal. Because I know it's not just, oh, like video
01:01:40 game a little difficult. It's that a person beat me and they're probably happy about it.
01:01:46 They're looking at my corpse and they're like, hey. That's the moment where you switch from full
01:01:50 retro to full gamer and just the explosion that follows is, you know. Yeah. And it's,
01:01:59 especially when like someone duels me, like I've played TF2 with Munchie before and he's
01:02:02 dueled me and I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Probably the worst experience of my life.
01:02:11 God damn it. God damn it. Fine, fine, fine. Probably the worst experience of my life was
01:02:17 playing brawl with you, Munchie. For the same reason, because I could tell you were having fun
01:02:22 and I wasn't, and that was unacceptable. Yeah. I was having fun for the first, okay. I was having
01:02:27 fun for the first couple of minutes because I didn't know how the way it would turn out. And
01:02:31 also the last couple of minutes because you were actually fighting me and it was fun at the end
01:02:35 because it was a real game at the end. Yeah. This is that like deleted video, right? That never
01:02:40 No, no, no. Oh, no, no, no, not the slime fest was saved. Unfortunately. Yeah. And all it's
01:02:47 fucking misery. Okay. Um, uh, I was going to say something. TF2? TF2? Oh, oh, oh, oh, it's not.
01:02:56 Because she's got ink. Just wondering about that. Yes. Also, inkling is awesome. Yeah.
01:03:00 That's true. These aren't captured any device, but I'm going to specifically call out Ethan
01:03:04 because I've dueled Ethan many times before late at night. And the way he gets when he's losing a
01:03:11 duel is simply indescribable. The most bitter that he could possibly get. Like that I've seen
01:03:20 a human become where it's like, like when you know that he sees you when he goes completely dead
01:03:27 silent, I would describe him as corpse silent to the point where he could not make a motion
01:03:32 even if you wanted to. I'll do that. And the amount of like expression that leaves his body
01:03:37 when he dies after after a heated encounter can only be described as like the creation of a sun
01:03:44 in a way where it's like on a cosmic scale, sounds leave his body. And when things are over,
01:03:51 when the rounds over and I win the duel by like a couple points, like you can like I physically
01:03:58 like saw like his soul leaving. I look up to the sky and I saw it leaving his body reaching towards
01:04:03 heaven. And let me just if you're not familiar. Wait, I always forget. Munchy, have you read Jojo?
01:04:13 I never remember the answer to this question. Yeah. Of course I have. Yeah. Okay. You know those
01:04:16 moments where like a character dies and you see like their ghosts like yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
01:04:20 like that's even spirit like floating away from his deceased gamer corpse. Did I fight
01:04:25 Ethan? Munchy, did I fight? Is Ethan one of the guys that we hung out with that one time?
01:04:30 Yes, he is. That time when I that time when I killed everyone. Yeah, that was crazy. That was
01:04:37 ridiculous. Yes. Wait, when did that happen? That was three before before everyone got before
01:04:43 you were like like you weren't there. Yeah, every at the law point. Everyone was laughing like oh,
01:04:49 look at the old look at the elder millennial with his princess P. And she doesn't know how to play
01:04:54 smash. And I fucking went in there with my fucking peach and my fucking you know, with my hip,
01:04:59 this isn't my fucking floating in the air and my fucking kick where you can see your panties if
01:05:05 you had pause it and ate the black hole. Wait, which version? Speaking of that, Jesse, the most
01:05:10 memorable moment of that was when you were about to get a kill and like I think when the tournament
01:05:14 before you did you did that up smash and then you just pause and saw our skirt. And that was the
01:05:18 last thing that happened before the other person died. That's what I want them to see before I
01:05:22 killed them. The last brawl. Is this brawl? No, no, melee, melee. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. I also want to
01:05:28 say you fucking zoomers. I was born in melee. I was molded by like never that was the first time
01:05:35 that I had ever seen like all those people that I had talked to like the like like for years.
01:05:41 And I was so tired from radcon three that I was sleeping in the cab. I got out. They all greeted
01:05:47 me. They were all so happy to see me. And I was like, yeah, yeah. Hey, is there like a bed?
01:05:54 Radcon three was was was an intense experience. So understandable.
01:05:59 Isn't that you know, it's an interesting conundrum. Yeah, seriously, radcon four. I was I realized
01:06:05 recently it's been like a year since radcon three. Yeah, I was wondering why my chakras were so low.
01:06:10 And then I agree. Of course, I haven't been recharged at radcon in so long. My Christ consciousness
01:06:15 has been fading. Radcons are honestly a really great thing just to do every once in a while.
01:06:21 They make you just feel good and alive. Yeah, you're with people who you like and we're competent.
01:06:26 Sometimes I have a flash and I realized that like there's for the vast majority of people,
01:06:33 they hang out with their friends daily. Yeah, we never do that. And I don't I don't understand
01:06:39 how that's even a thing like like it's a yearly event for me. It's bizarre. It really does. It
01:06:46 takes me back to those high school days when you actually could see your friends every weekend and
01:06:50 like hang out and eat pizza and stuff and have like sort of a pizza party, you know. If you had
01:06:57 a microphone back in those days, some manner of podcast. Oh my god. Where if only I could find
01:07:05 that feeling again if only I could find those glory days again. What? But I can't I can't seem to see
01:07:10 it. I can't find it. I'm having a I'm having a flash. Where is it? Where is it? It's on the tip of my
01:07:17 tongue. I can't I can't remember. Can't go back to that place. We sealed those memories away long ago.
01:07:23 Where's the podcast? Hey, we've got voice signals about that. I mean, I feel like we just been
01:07:32 we got endless stuff to talk about today. We've only been gone for an hour. That's true. I'm just
01:07:36 saying we've got we've got stuff about that. But yeah, we can keep going. I mean, I can I can shift
01:07:42 gears a little and talk about Homestuck a little bit a little bit of Homestuck. I got the the the
01:07:48 was a book for act five act one, which is a big heavy tone. And I've been reading it and it's
01:07:55 great. It's with where all the trolls are introduced. Do you have all the books?
01:08:00 No, I specifically have been, you know, because I really only want the troll ones act five and
01:08:08 act five act two. And I already have all guys I didn't realize they were they had continued
01:08:14 making the books. But I guess yeah, well, once once Hussie got bought out by a media conglomerate
01:08:21 or whatever, whatever happened. Yes. Well, he's underneath it now. So like Homestuck.com is
01:08:28 you know, I mean, that's like how it's not like Bioware got bought up by Activision. And now
01:08:32 they're slowly dying. Oh, no, he there's nothing like wrong with like the Homestuck books, they just
01:08:38 got to kind of shitty covers. But that's how they're gonna make like the final flash into a book,
01:08:43 you know. Well, the same way they've been making flashes into a book form the whole time is just
01:08:49 take screen grabs and then underneath Hussie gives his author notes. So he says God, if only this
01:08:54 was online, you'd be really good time right now in some format, it was possible to create like
01:08:59 moving images. But alas, we're trapped on this stone cold. Yeah, I just want to brag I just want
01:09:05 to brag that I have I have the entire the entirety of problem sleuth in book form. Oh, dude, same.
01:09:10 It's high five. It's great. High fucking hoof, brother. Yeah. But yeah, specifically about this
01:09:17 book, though, the the the author commentary, which is under every page of these books. I have
01:09:24 book three already, the old book three, and I was reading those and those sort of interesting,
01:09:30 sometimes silly, sometimes sort of a pointless but you know, it's Andrew Hussie's writing and I
01:09:36 love Andrew Hussie's writing. So it's generally good. But with with the trolls, he kind of went
01:09:42 like super deep analytical like arm retrieval tier sort of explanations of all of these troll
01:09:51 characters and their place in the story and the way he was thinking when he was writing them.
01:09:54 And it was really insightful, especially when he got to risk and explained why
01:09:59 risk is canonically and like in an outside universe, his wife in every facet in every
01:10:05 single possible way. And he had so many notes. He had so many notes about it that like the notes
01:10:11 went from one page to the other and he had the arrows going literally just made his waifu like
01:10:16 the most important character. No, it's not as dumb as that. Maybe it is. But like it was just
01:10:22 that the role she had in the story is like one little snippet of notes that I can try and remember
01:10:30 was that as she is like the bitch character, she's like the trolliest of trolls. She causes the
01:10:36 controversy and she like attacks and like tries to fuck up everyone's shit constantly. And she is
01:10:44 like sort of like a like a tier two surrogate author character, because the way he was talking
01:10:50 about it was as an author, you create your creations and then you give them problems to overcome.
01:10:56 And the more problems you give them and the harsher, you know, punishment you deal them,
01:11:01 you know, the more dramatic it becomes. And so Vriska being his favorite and like in universe
01:11:07 love interest, because his character is a character in the comic, like he loves Vriska,
01:11:16 is like part of the fact that she is kind of doing what he would otherwise be doing as an
01:11:21 author, you know, that is like putting problems in the way of the create the OCs he's made.
01:11:29 Is this like what he was thinking when he wrote her? Or is this him reflecting in the hindsight
01:11:33 and being like, you know, I could probably formulate an argument for this combination.
01:11:40 The way it comes across in the way he's writing, I mean, sometimes he does like say,
01:11:45 yeah, the reason I probably did this was because I was lazy, but I'd like to think it was some other
01:11:49 reason like he's quite about it. No, no, no, but he is being accurate, like some things he feels
01:11:56 are lazy. But it's usually just visual things. But things with like the trolls, he thought of
01:12:00 all the trolls before he started, he just didn't know what they look like. Or like, you know,
01:12:05 he came up with the zodiac signs, and the 12 of them, and then he came up with little things,
01:12:11 like he probably had a notepad with like, this is various things that can all these characters
01:12:15 can mean. And then he wrote them down. And then as he as he was going through, like,
01:12:21 Act five, Act one was like made really quickly, using all new assets and all new alien technology
01:12:29 and world building that he was kind of making up as he went. And it was, it's just, it's just
01:12:33 really brilliant to see. And I totally believe that the notes that he leaves behind, leaves under
01:12:40 the pages explaining his thought process, because it doesn't seem completely impossible. It just
01:12:46 seems like he had an idea, he went with it, and then he made it continue to work in the future.
01:12:51 And the ones, the trolls that weren't important became nothing.
01:12:55 Act one, I would be especially interested in reading his notes about.
01:12:59 They're all online. You can read them as the arm retrieval guy. It may sound weird that I'm
01:13:06 very, very quick to come to Hussie's defense here. Because Hussie is no idiot. He's not stupid.
01:13:14 Act six is not the work of someone who is just simply stupid. The thing is that he doesn't care
01:13:22 anymore. I have no doubt about Hussie's right ability. As he's shown, he like in the early
01:13:27 acts of homes like he is literally like probably my favorite writer ever. He just, I resonate with
01:13:33 his work more or so about than any other person in the world or earth that I've had. So it's not,
01:13:39 I don't think that Hussie just became stupid or that it's hard for me to believe that he had all
01:13:46 of these things planned out when he was originally writing the trolls. That's not unrealist to me
01:13:51 whatsoever. So I have no reason to doubt him that he can articulate the way that he felt before.
01:13:55 Well, some things are straight up retconned as they go along. So not every single thing was planned
01:13:58 from the beginning. Well, sure. But these major things that tie into the entirety of a character
01:14:04 who's probably playing. You know, I bet if we really dug into that, I could point out some
01:14:09 ways that it's not as brilliant as everybody seems to think it is. I mean, I don't know what
01:14:12 specifics we're talking about. If you understand the things that Hussie writes and the reasoning
01:14:20 he's giving for why he writes them that way, you come to understand that no, it's more likely that
01:14:27 he came up with the things and then he just got lazy later and didn't give a shit about making
01:14:32 the art very good. Like that's far more likely based on what I know about him and his writing.
01:14:37 Exactly. I think about the things that I know about him. What are the elements of this? There
01:14:43 is a pseudo self insert character. Very Hussie happens all the time. Aside from his literal
01:14:50 self insert, he describes very often in many old form springs about how many of the characters are
01:14:56 aspects of himself in very clear ways. Like he refers to Dave and Dirk as author inserts in
01:15:01 many ways. What are the other elements of this? You know, Riska being like a force, like just a
01:15:09 force for chaos and a force to drive the storm. Yeah, for the authorial wrath. Yeah, that is also
01:15:15 very Hussie and just his general attitude and way he's described things in his general humor style
01:15:21 is often just inflict pain upon others. And it's literally just something that he likes to do.
01:15:27 I don't think that's that's that's weird. I was I was saying I was saying on the I was saying on
01:15:32 the video before that just makes me so mad. It makes me so mad that people in this day and age
01:15:38 in 2019 year of our lord will roll their eyes at Homestuck and not and think of it as anything
01:15:43 other than just a brilliant work of genius. Hey man, I love Homestuck. Yeah, despite all its flaws,
01:15:50 like people that haven't read Homestuck, they just go like yeah. Yeah, Homestuck. Yeah, that's
01:15:54 dumb thing. Isn't it impossible to read more? Isn't it like impossible to read now though,
01:15:59 because the flash is down or whatever? No, no, it was the website. The website has changed and
01:16:06 the some of the flashes have been replaced with well all of the flashes exist, but you just have
01:16:11 to click on a little I was in which is the site from flash version to like non flash version. I
01:16:15 was in a comic book store and I saw like all of Homestuck in book form. And I was thinking like
01:16:21 how the hell does that work? I thought it was like a game or something. I would not want to read
01:16:27 it in book form. Not first, at least. No, not first. Yeah. It's definitely like a supplemental
01:16:35 item. And I like having it as an object. I like reading the author. It's like buying the soundtrack
01:16:41 to a sheet like or something. It has to lose so much. I flipped through it to try and like
01:16:48 understand like how you put this thing in a book. And it's like, yeah, all the things that
01:16:52 used to be like one sequential page of a like a website are now like all put together as panels
01:16:58 in a page. And it's like you are John Egbert and you're fucking over here and you're doing this
01:17:03 and it's like all on one page. And I'm like, how the fuck do you read this? Where do these words
01:17:06 go? Well, it's it was very confusing. It's not great. It's not great. I have I have book one and
01:17:12 two. And I regard them fondly. And I love to read the commentary. But it is. It's not fun to read.
01:17:21 I don't like it. Like it's not a great home stuck not so great. Just not good.
01:17:30 I've got the problem sleuth books. You know, I like them. I like reading them. But like the
01:17:34 animated segments lose like most of their impact much. Yeah, like they lose basically it's not
01:17:43 even an adaptation. It's just a straight copy paste like without any like you adapt a manga to an
01:17:49 anime like you do an a real adaptation you redraw you reformulate. But this is just you know,
01:17:54 basically like a flash zip file with the PNG is copied over to well, I mean, there's a little bit
01:18:01 like like the sepulchretude parts. There's like, you know, like the the it sort of flows out like
01:18:07 it like kind of covers the page and parts and like, I mean, there is some adaptation going on
01:18:13 there. But yeah, I mean, oh, by the way, the troll romance section was notes were really funny.
01:18:21 And I would recommend you at least try and find the notes. He was like making fun of
01:18:27 those wasn't he wasn't that like his main goal with that? Yeah, yeah. Well,
01:18:31 he was basically explaining how it's not actually as ridiculous as it looks. And it's
01:18:35 basically just human. It's just human romance. But with certain aspects of human romance given
01:18:40 silly names, and he made it look like ridiculous. And so people were freaking out and he was like,
01:18:46 that's the sort of thing he likes doing. Yeah, I mean, it's great. Definitely. I mean, there's
01:18:51 there's nothing like he brings when he brings the trauma romance back, he's like, oh, you don't
01:18:57 think I'm going to do it. And he has like all the text from all those pages, but like in tiny,
01:19:02 tiny, tiny typeface filling an entire page. And then like on the other page opposite is just him
01:19:08 doing that the laughing like haha. Got him. And it's like, wow. And then in the author notes
01:19:14 underneath both of those pages, he also put the exact same text. Oh, you know, it'd be really
01:19:19 funny if I put all of this troll romance stuff in the author notes as well. Oh, you don't think
01:19:23 I'll do it. And then he does like it's so hard to read funny. I can't believe Hussie never dabbed
01:19:29 a single time in the entire course of Homestuck. You might be able to find some some some dab like
01:19:35 positions there. I think I think just wasn't it wasn't a big did I mention okay, I think I might
01:19:40 have talked about this. Stop me if I've told this before. But I really like these videos by John
01:19:44 Boyce called like pretty good. And just he does like things about sports that are interesting.
01:19:51 And he and his he and one of his cohorts at SB nation discovered discovered the very first dab,
01:19:59 like the pro the proto dab. Was it Michael Jackson or something? No, it was just done by some player
01:20:06 on the on the the Troy State basketball college basketball team in the Troy State versus DeVry
01:20:13 University basketball game that holds the record for most baskets scored in a basketball game ever
01:20:19 in any in any league. But but how can you actually know that's really the first one though? I always
01:20:23 thought well it's the first one anyone's ever seen. The dab was like taken in inspiration at
01:20:30 least from Usain Bolt when he does the thing with pointing with two hands in the same direction.
01:20:36 You know that what I think I know what you're talking about. Yeah, who knows the same sort of
01:20:41 thing. I mean, okay, the guy in this the guy in this like record breaking basketball game,
01:20:46 he doesn't do like a full and he does sort of like a double mover like first he brings his arms to
01:20:51 the side and then he sort of bends over and like kind of moves them up in a in a it's sort of it's
01:20:58 like a proto dab. Yeah, okay, okay, it's not quite a dab as we understand it today. But it is, you
01:21:04 know, it has all the underpinning evolution. It has all the ideological underpinnings of a dab.
01:21:08 Uh, yes, okay. I think that's neat. Word. So what about the fastest dab of all time? Oh,
01:21:17 I can do that. Have you seen that video of the dude do moving at light speed? Have you guys seen
01:21:23 the video electrocuted myself to dab? No, there I was shown a fantastic YouTube channel highly
01:21:32 recommended. Michael Reeves, he is a like a baby, the smallest genius ever made, but he is perhaps
01:21:43 the funny it like the smartest person on earth. Okay, I'm sure it's really smart exclusively
01:21:50 exclusively for evil. I'm sure he's a technical creative genius. But he does things like programming
01:21:58 a robot to shoot him when he gets shot in fortnight or or electrocuting his muscles to force
01:22:04 him to dab. I'm gonna link it down right now. Okay, that's great. But please also review this
01:22:08 quickest dab ever caught on film. I love quickest dab. It's like it's like watching a frog catch a
01:22:15 fly with its tongue. It's so fast. It's so just you can't comprehend it in real time. Yeah, no,
01:22:21 the I can't catch it. I don't think the camera even caught the whole motion in like in he did it
01:22:27 like with between frames he hit the dab and then it's like there's just like the suggestion of the
01:22:32 motion indeed you understand but you understand what happens god damn impressive impressive. It's
01:22:39 like pornography you can't quantify it but you know there's something going on when you see you know
01:22:45 a dab when you see it. You can't you can't define a dab. Yeah, electrocuting my muscles to force me
01:22:51 to dab. He's screaming in pain. Did it work? Yeah. Oh, it worked. It worked perfectly. Damn,
01:23:00 but what was what was the trigger for the electrocution? These medical grade like electrodes
01:23:08 that he had strapped on to his entire body like like on his shoulders on his back that would
01:23:13 hide in the high frequency electricity signals to certain parts but parts of his body to cause
01:23:19 the spasm uncontrollable. Okay, I'm with you on that but the only issue with that is how do we
01:23:23 know that this is even true because we can't like prove he did it on an unsuspecting person who
01:23:29 didn't know what's happening but you could say he was lying but he does like I don't know I believe
01:23:33 him he does he does multiple like truth checks to like really okay yeah okay I'll have to check it
01:23:38 out more thoroughly um a robot shooting when I get shot in fortnight he um he like he like
01:23:45 does like a like a close-up of his muscles while they're spasming and like in a way that like I
01:23:50 don't think that you would be able to like fake if even if you wanted to and I see he's using the uh
01:23:55 the strand's cutaneous uh electrical nerves oh wait I thought it was a meme it the acronym is
01:24:02 shit but it just doesn't matter wait never mind wait you mean you meant like the the the place
01:24:08 where he put the electrodes makes the specific muscles that forces him to literally do the
01:24:13 dab yeah I thought it was like yeah whoa I thought it was like um if you don't dab you get electrocuted
01:24:18 or something no that's pretty that's that's way more sciencey and impressive yeah I like this
01:24:25 channel this channel confuses me there's there's a weird uh uh anomaly you scroll through his videos
01:24:30 there's like trigger me Elmo electrocuting my muscles to force me to dab I built the stupidest
01:24:36 gun in the world but if you scroll all the way down amongst all this stuff there's just like
01:24:41 two C sharp tutorials yeah I don't understand are they like tongue-in-cheek or no that's so odd
01:24:50 I'm trying to scroll through to see him like electrocuting his dab muscles I just want to see
01:24:55 it work it's towards the end yeah yeah it's there it's there
01:25:02 I mean he's the guy seems to be we got to watch this video like thoroughly to to analyze the
01:25:07 yeah yeah you know up front okay but anyway people enough on that uh uh uh I mean anybody else got
01:25:14 anything they want to talk about because I'm just letting you know we have like a bunch of voicemails
01:25:18 so we could spend a while on that a bunch we have like like 17 I'm not anything that isn't
01:25:24 home stuck because I have nothing to contribute fair enough Tom you got to read it you got to read
01:25:29 it dude it's the only way I had to get through Naruto Kai yeah Naruto Kai that should be your thing
01:25:37 Tom didn't you want to like didn't you want to like school me about like politics on the last episode
01:25:42 no I would but the point of me bringing it up was just that I thought it was gay that it ruined
01:25:46 the awesome art vibe I was having oh okay fair enough and then you told me I don't think I had that
01:25:52 I mean I remember Tom saying I think you tweeted the other day at the tweet I very much sympathized
01:25:55 with that was like something about like have lots of political things but the only thing I hate more
01:26:00 than political ideas I disagree with is tweeting about politics I know the thing about the tweet
01:26:04 the actual tweet was I have tons of strong political opinions but my strongest political
01:26:08 opinion is I hate talking about political right right okay um gay well fair enough fair enough
01:26:16 okay but regardless we got like a million fucking things we might as well get a million I'm not
01:26:21 something like there are 17 of these okay summer summer but um but uh okay the good news is uh we've
01:26:29 got uh some pizza party podcast updates here uh oh so let's just check in uh let me see this one is
01:26:36 okay this one's called where's the podcast okay let's let's see what this one has to say
01:26:41 eternal question I'm watching Michael Reeves just scream and pain as he's muscles forcibly
01:26:47 dab for him that's great great well while you're in agony listen to this uh as well
01:26:54 everyone was too busy asking where's the podcast that nobody bothered to ask
01:27:03 how's the podcast and I just think that's pretty sad I already know that it has to be
01:27:13 the most glorious podcast it has to be the thing that will finally fill that void in me
01:27:19 that I'm just I'm just every day all day I'm just scarfing content I'm just opening up my
01:27:24 brain hole and scooping as much content into it as I possibly can just to fill something to fill
01:27:29 that hole to fill some need in me that I can't even identify and I know that the pizza party
01:27:34 podcast would be it if only I could find it out there in the vast nothingness that is our modern
01:27:40 reality speaking of filling holes okay stick with me for a second uh has anyone ever read
01:27:47 that uh I forget his name ito I eat oh okay he knows exactly where I'm going uh there's this
01:27:53 there's this one the cracks in the rock or something I forget what it's called but it's
01:27:57 about a girl who I forget what happens she gets like grease on her and it creates a bunch of like
01:28:02 holes in her skin and it just happens more and more uh like her whole body gets covered in
01:28:07 these disgusting holes and she finds kind of joy in inserting things into them it gives her pleasure
01:28:14 so I'm just so just the the money shot is at the very end the final page is like her mom walks
01:28:19 out on her alone in a room that's her whole body is not only covered with holes but has
01:28:23 all been filled by objects that she's pleasuring herself with all these holes all over her body
01:28:29 as she says to her mom mom I need more I can't fill all the holes and that's now that's that's

01:33:35 opened the show it's all about skill the difference between uh gambling and sending a voicemail to the
01:33:42 pcp is that with the pcp even if you win you still lose with gambling you actually do win
01:33:50 there's the chance however remote okay next voicemail is from a free thinker but spelled with

01:38:24 fact will charge you again yeah double charge uh thanks for the credit card number idiot uh rodine
01:38:30 has a voicemail for us let's listen up you probably turned this off once you know who i am
01:38:36 i used to go by the name binary dude and was hailed by jesse as the worst commenter of all time
01:38:41 oh yes looking back i can simply see why it was everything that i said was my fault and i know
01:38:46 like probably jesse gets to do a lot but from that moment from like three days since that moment i
01:38:51 end on i just became really unsatisfied with how i was speaking the internet in general i did not know
01:38:58 it was completely because of my autistic fucking retardedness because i just didn't think about it
01:39:04 and just how that can look like like actually affect someone's day just a thought of ruining
01:39:09 someone's day because of some bullshit i said online is something that stayed with me and
01:39:12 actually altered my behavior on how i deal with this stuff online so even though i had no redemption
01:39:17 arc and of course i didn't act like a fucking jackass um at least i got that awareness and for
01:39:23 whatever for whatever that's worth i am completely sorry to jesse he's actually a guy i uh tried to
01:39:29 watch every video nowadays whenever they come up um so i probably there's nothing i can say that like
01:39:36 okay okay we got it disconnect is is too sad i thought i thought i thought it's over it's over
01:39:44 i thought there was a joke coming i thought there was gonna be a subversion of my expectations
01:39:48 that was worse than a bad comment all right that's fair i you're fucked up even harder this time
01:39:54 yeah i thought i thought i'd show him because just here's a guy who's who's who's who's who's
01:39:59 trying to redeem himself and i would just think it isn't that nice to see someone you know i do
01:40:05 remember the guy i don't remember what his comment was about i remember like an argument i think
01:40:10 like a long argument i remember writing paragraphs and paragraphs and like i remember like months
01:40:16 after that maybe a year after that he like he found like my defunct endless jest facebook page and like
01:40:23 messaged me like a private message to me like this even more massive like apology oh and that was
01:40:29 years ago that was years ago so this guy has been like stewing in this for years well you know what
01:40:34 maybe this will be his catharsis the fact that he was able to to be on here maybe he can rest in
01:40:39 peace at long last hopefully i mean i i don't even know what i don't remember what was bad about it
01:40:46 i'm sure your comment was horrible but i don't care you know this is the funny thing i i'm sure
01:40:50 that i've since seen many worse commenters in fact i i can guarantee it so don't please don't
01:40:56 beat yourself up about it anymore well yeah than you already have i think there's a lesson to be
01:41:01 learned here that that's something like well well it's possible he may have been a total pants on
01:41:06 head retarded commenter at one point like you don't need external validation necessarily like if
01:41:12 you've changed your ways or whatever and you're like you know what i'm not gonna do this anymore
01:41:15 don't feel like you you need like odds are the person you're wrong like they don't care anymore
01:41:20 you know maybe sometimes they might uh but certainly as like as if you're like a shitty
01:41:24 commenter odds are even if you were like a jerk or you made a bad impression on somebody odds are
01:41:29 they don't like specifically remember you or anything so if you just improve your overall
01:41:33 behavior going forward then you'll probably you know that that's really the best good you
01:41:37 can do for the world i'd say probably oh i don't want to shout out specific bad commenters right
01:41:42 now i don't want to cut out spider he makes these comments about how the piece of your
01:41:45 shit and you know keep it up dude and calls me out regularly and you know great job with that
01:41:49 however how much ironic this is cardinal sin which makes me so fucking mad spider just make one
01:41:55 long comment i hate that you make eight new fucking comments on the new episode video that's
01:42:00 your comments to find just put them one it must be so fucking mad when i scroll down
01:42:04 i see your name 500 times right the one i beg you no dude more comments is more engagement it
01:42:11 helps with the algorithm shut up well does youtube know that though i mean maybe does youtube know
01:42:17 about their algorithm i do you think i've heard about this has anyone told them about this algorithm
01:42:23 thing like it's really fucking us up uh maybe we just told them maybe if it knows it's the same
01:42:28 person commenting it doesn't get counted i don't know i don't know okay well in any case i'm begging
01:42:34 in any case in any case thank you for continuing to watch my videos i guess please don't hate yourself
01:42:40 anymore i think he'll he'll get over it he's he's pulling those big boy pants all is forgiven
01:42:46 my son okay moving on uh speaking of forgiveness we're gonna need some after this because it's the

01:45:47 show this is yeah i don't remember uh okay zoomer joe is calling in once again uh let's give him a
01:45:52 floor challenge he looks like sniper joe but he just has like a bernie 2020 hat on him that's him
01:45:58 okay go hey guys it's me zoomer joe again this time i'm calling in from my vr headset actually i'm
01:46:06 doing a new challenge a new zoomer challenge that all the kids are doing it's called calling to the
01:46:11 procrastinator's show while in vr but the vr room that you're in is actually a room with your
01:46:16 mother staring intently at you looking disappointed that's what i'm doing i'm calling you right now
01:46:22 i'm speaking these words while staring into the disapproving soulless eyes of my very own mother
01:46:29 well i gotta go now zoom i like the zoom i like the action he did it he he beat the challenge
01:46:38 what was the challenge wow call into the channel oh i like how it's not a challenge for anyone else
01:46:46 it's just a challenge for him and he's already completed it by the time he calls well you just
01:46:50 gotta get your mom to fucking to fucking you know understand what you're doing so she'll look at
01:46:55 you disappointedly oh and then and then the challenge begins incidentally zoomer joe after
01:46:59 listening to last episode he left a separate message and said do not play the one i just played
01:47:04 he said play the other one the thing is though this one was funnier than the other one so i just
01:47:08 didn't want to you made the executive decision indeed i did and it paid off in spades yep all
01:47:12 all right i think so cool okay moving on uh we've got another call from correct correct okay go
01:47:19 okay spell differently hey you fucking nuts i'm curious given someone who disagrees with you
01:47:27 do you tend to believe more frequently that they have been misled by a set of incorrect information
01:47:34 or do you tend to believe that they just value different things to you i that's a real question
01:47:42 i assume i will assume that they are misinformed first and only only only after like only after
01:47:49 like serious probing of the subject we like disappointedly conclude that their their core
01:47:54 values are just fucked because they're different from mine right uh you know i've uh i've noticed
01:48:01 that i've i think for a long time i've been possibly a way too charitable arguer and that
01:48:08 like i'm it seems like when i argue i'm looking for ways generally with someone i would like
01:48:12 respect and don't think it's like a total idiot i'll i'll look for ways to like you know make them
01:48:18 seem like to really straw a steel man their argument i guess like i guess that's what i'm
01:48:22 just describing a really steel man arguments and i want to touch on like wait what what is a steel
01:48:26 man well it's it's the opposite of a straw man or what you're well sort of an opposite it's what
01:48:30 what you're trying to do is give the strongest best possible interpretation of your like quote
01:48:35 unquote opponents did you make this up no no it's it's making the rounds i i didn't make it up um
01:48:40 it's it's pretty good though it's uh i mean i pretty much believe in it i think it's like the
01:48:44 best way to get to like good faith arguments though to to abide by it so i guess just answer
01:48:49 his question i think i think that i generally go to like my default now is that people have
01:48:53 different values that's that's seems to be where i start whether that's smart or not i don't know
01:48:58 i i i start arguing text because if i am to take this in the way it's probably obviously
01:49:04 meant and like the stuff we've been talking about recently about politics and stuff like that yeah
01:49:09 i think most likely my my first reaction is why do you think that like like what like why are you
01:49:17 thinking that and that could be your misled but i don't know if i know i don't know if i make a
01:49:24 judgment on whether what people do i just kind of want to find out why and then i'll make my
01:49:29 decision based upon it but if i had to like guess like it like what do i think the people at large
01:49:34 like are they irrational or are they rational i would say i think like they are like just they
01:49:40 had different values than me in general i i think that it they might not just be like
01:49:45 led astray yeah i don't know that's a particularly healthy way i think i've come to a conclusion
01:49:50 about this that might seem radical to some yeah i i have come to find that opinions in general
01:49:57 having opinions is just wrong and it's bad and i so i i don't have any i strive to have evolved
01:50:04 beyond the need for any opinion so that i can just fucking float and just like be like water you know
01:50:09 that's kind of what the monks do right they try to just dissociate from reality because like you
01:50:13 know because humans are not rational humans are highly irrational highly stupid morally
01:50:19 bankrupt evil sacks of shit every single one of them and like every opinion that you see
01:50:26 if you talk to these people even a good opinion that you think is good even an opinion that you
01:50:29 might agree with if you talk to these people and if you scratch the surface you will find
01:50:33 the insanity behind everyone's reasoning everyone has their own fucked up just their
01:50:41 brains are just shit everyone's brain is just shit and piss and cum and it's just that's all
01:50:47 there is even even even something that you think sounds smart if you really scratch the surface
01:50:52 and talk to the person long enough you'll realize they only think that because of something fucking
01:50:57 wrong with their brain everyone is fucked no opinions allowed i don't like them just everyone
01:51:03 just be like water man just fill the glass you're in okay fuck it there there's go with it i mean
01:51:09 it kind of makes sense i mean when you get like to like a large enough scale like if you're like a
01:51:13 president or like a a dictator whatever like you don't treat like your subjects even if you're like
01:51:20 the smartest rule it doesn't really make sense to like treat your rule like your subject like they're
01:51:24 all like perfect philosophers who you know are able to like totally like you appeal to like
01:51:29 their interests like if you got like a farming population you're like okay let's like lower
01:51:34 taxes on like seeds and i don't know if you there's somebody else you don't like let's raise taxes on
01:51:40 something else it's like boom i just boosted my popularity and you can even may argue that like
01:51:45 that was like a good thing because there's like more farmers in the country than there are i don't
01:51:50 know like lawyers or something and so was this an objective good uh i don't know maybe uh may i feel
01:51:56 like i just got whiplash right now how is this really what was just saying what just being said
01:52:00 well i'm just like i'm i'm trying to make a comparison of like the the how there's no like
01:52:06 there's no inherent like correctness in any kind of like political idea that a lot of it is just
01:52:11 coming down to like a person's personal values like that you could call you can call that just
01:52:15 like their own personal madness just like that's not that's not the that's not the question well i
01:52:21 know i'm just responding to jesse's point though and i'm aware i'm you know wondering a little bit
01:52:26 i don't think it's totally irrelevant like all these people commenting on on my videos like oh
01:52:31 your opinion is bad you have the wrong opinion and it's like you don't get it it's not my opinion
01:52:36 it's all made up i made it up because it's funny fuck you i can't be right or wrong i don't fucking
01:52:42 give a shit what you think i'm wrong about resident evil too because i said i hate it i lied
01:52:47 it's great you fucking morons you clods you dumbasses you're just playing right into my hands
01:52:53 um i don't know correct i have no fucking opinion i can't be wrong i have no opinion so i'm always
01:53:02 right that's the perfect flawless position unassailable from any side uh well moving on
01:53:08 let's move on to comments our sin by our next commenter comments our sin uh go
01:53:16 in regard to the point that ben made last podcast about not wanting to have comments associated
01:53:21 with your work because inherently when there's comments under like a youtube video you associated
01:53:26 with it when i was reading through hunter hunter on the most unsavory of online sites i found this
01:53:33 one motherfucking commenter who at the end of every chapter would just post the most
01:53:38 uninsightful vapid trying to be funny he had a fucking he had the fucking um guts icon
01:53:45 the guts face where he's like smiling really big and it just made me hate him even more
01:53:50 to know that he ride berserk as well but it was just like he developed a cult of personality
01:53:55 in this comment section people would comment and say just hate him just attack him and he
01:54:00 would just keep doing it and he got stronger from it and all i can think of is just like why
01:54:04 is this part of my hunter hunter experience why is it tied to this now but also why am i so interested
01:54:12 fair question you got sucked into the cult man we got a deep platform guts guy
01:54:18 he's like uh he can't he can't keep getting away with it who's that one famous commenter
01:54:21 kevin why or something is that him you know i'm talking about uh you talking about retro
01:54:26 gamer kevin no no there's this guy who comments on like every does the y stand for yellow i don't
01:54:31 know god damn all right let's move on i guess um wait who is kevin why there there is like a famous
01:54:37 youtube commenter with like he's got several hundred thousand subs but no videos and his thing
01:54:42 is that he just comments on like every video uh it just goes around and like is a notable
01:54:48 commenter on youtube are are they good comments i don't think they're that good i'm not really
01:54:53 sure i haven't studied them how did this happen they can't possibly be that good how could this
01:54:57 how could this have happened yeah this is a mistake we need to detach his platform i don't know i don't
01:55:03 know i i mean he's he's not benefiting from it because he doesn't make videos it's just no what
01:55:09 if he had his own patreon like just to support his comment does he have a silver play button
01:55:15 sorry oh maybe he should get the silver play button as like a creator on youtube right maybe
01:55:19 you have to have one video the only one who never made a video to get the silver play button
01:55:26 he might he gets like a silver like a comment submit button instead oh yeah yeah it just says submit
01:55:35 he's a hero um anyway well that's fascinating yeah he's a fascinating guy and this this this
01:55:40 comment this this voicemail uh was interesting as well and it's just yeah like i don't know like
01:55:45 with somebody like me who reads one piece weekly and stuff i go to like 4chan on a and like talk
01:55:50 about it in a group but that's like me seeking that out specifically like on on manga stream or
01:55:56 gymonies box or whatever like there's no comment section like directly under it so i i'm totally
01:56:00 free of that and it's great and i'm super happy that that's the case uh so yeah i don't know i it's
01:56:06 i definitely will impact like the delivery of the content if there's like you know
01:56:11 visible comments around it or on it or whatever so uh yeah you know it's always felt really weird
01:56:16 to me um and i also keep looking at them even though i hey i don't like them at all is uh
01:56:22 comments under like hentai and porn yeah we talked about that and and comments on porn are so weird
01:56:28 like i remember like uh that on the site site frequent there was always this one guy who would
01:56:33 have something funny to say on every page of every dojin and hentai i was like
01:56:37 like what what are you doing and then like he it can be cool but then he's sort of it's the same
01:56:44 sort of thing the cult of personality people started to recognize this guy and then people
01:56:48 started to imitate this guy and and like there was a whole there was a whole like subculture on
01:56:54 this porn site people were jacking off and then laughing or like hating got any examples of like
01:57:00 what he might say in general uh i mean it was never like unfunny it was just sort of like
01:57:07 i'm trying to jack off this is a porn time sure what does he get out of it what does he get out
01:57:11 of posting a little bit of community a little community in this particular you know forum or
01:57:16 whatever well but there was no form like back and forth it was just like he was throwing his thing
01:57:21 out in there and then people would keep seeing it well i mean it's i think that the what you get
01:57:24 out is just yeah it's exactly that it's like you like you're here obviously people do come here
01:57:28 to some degree if you comment they might see your thoughts and it might you know feel kind of nice
01:57:33 if people like or see your comments especially if as this guy has it becomes kind of a thing that you
01:57:38 do so i'm not saying it's a lot but i'm saying there's there's something of value same with you
01:57:43 too i want to like go off i'm like how this is so weird how people spend their time and build
01:57:48 community but i spent like three years talking about my little pony so i have no i've no ground
01:57:53 not too different from that equally sexual i'd say
01:58:00 okay let's move on hey season nine just premiered like yesterday uh no it did is this the last season
01:58:07 yeah oh god oh no what are we gonna do guys what are we gonna do our revenue stream is gonna dry out
01:58:14 yeah this is our cash cow i watched the latest episodes of my own did i ever talk about this
01:58:19 no i don't think so no i watched a handful of them you mentioned it once or twice how they how they
01:58:24 hold up i um how do they hold up yeah uh on how the age paralleled okay so i watched this
01:58:33 probably the worst possible way that i could go about doing it and that's um i watched season eight
01:58:40 and sevens uh start and end in reverse order okay so i watched four two parts in reverse order
01:58:49 so i watched the end of season eight the beginning of season eight the end of season seven and the
01:58:54 beginning of season seven and uh it was sort of like being on drugs in a way that like you can't
01:59:03 really trust what your body is perceiving sure uh the first thing being thrown back into the arena
01:59:11 after uh you know being away from from hashtag enter the arena hashtag right before exactly uh
01:59:18 was okay the end of season eight was unbelievable how much change from really what i just dude i've
01:59:27 seen the like collections of new characters and i'm like who are these people what is this okay
01:59:33 it's uh it's pretty insane it's bizarre there's like a weird like red not not knowing what happened
01:59:38 between net then isn't like tirak back as like a good guy or something now i think i saw that
01:59:43 he was back in a new episode he was in the most latest uh latest episode all right the last thing
01:59:48 i remember happy to my little pony is twilight and the main sick go to like a parody of new
01:59:53 york and rarity is there and she makes dresses and she works herself too hard yeah i remember that
01:59:57 now twilight is the headmaster of a school what there's a literal weird white nationalist pony
02:00:03 who wants to wipe out the other sub races dude yes this school is meant to be for ponies only
02:00:10 these beasts are not fit these not fab to the equestria school unified school district guidelines
02:00:17 is is there a pony is there a pony trump is this pony um it might as well be this guy it might as
02:00:21 well be this guy imagine if imagine if like ponyville got a new mayor like they elected a new and he's
02:00:27 like orange and he has like a big like swooshy blonde mane and he's all like wrinkly and stuff he's
02:00:32 like a mean boy gotta build a wall like is is is is the headmaster they wouldn't do it too they would
02:00:38 fucking do you know honestly he got elected because he was colluding with the dragons they don't forget
02:00:45 my little pony came down hard against communism so i don't think they're like that uh i don't know
02:00:51 anti trump e i mean maybe i'm just talking to everyone knows communism's bad but uh that's that's
02:00:57 like uh like a big jump to take all right all right you know what you know what that's a huge
02:01:01 jump that i sound dumb okay fair point i i i i will give them credit i think they're a little bit
02:01:06 most of the world agrees communism isn't great but i gotta get into the world i think we know
02:01:14 what's going on okay anyway much but i'm sorry okay so so twilight is the headmaster of a school
02:01:19 and the main six are like teachers at this giant college is erected in ponyville is what is your
02:01:25 high on is fluttershy a teacher too yeah i think it makes sense that doesn't make sense she wouldn't
02:01:30 be a team why do they make what fluttershy in fact has won teacher of the month for like two years in
02:01:35 a row because she fucks her students because she won't say no that's why she has low self-esteem
02:01:40 she makes up for it like all sexy young women do by becoming ethos uh and this is the closest you
02:01:45 can get um wait i don't nate i don't see your logic here that fluttershy wouldn't be fit to be a teacher
02:01:51 isn't she i don't know she doesn't seem like she's like she's the element of kindness she's
02:01:58 she's the she's the perfect teacher okay isn't she like what about pinkie pinkie she would like
02:02:03 to be a teacher pinkie can't be a teacher can she like not talk to people doesn't have a whole
02:02:06 point you gotta get in front of like a bunch of like lecture to people fluttershy is so far beyond
02:02:11 that she's grown she has grown i guess she has grown she made she made so many baby steps that
02:02:16 they added up to one adult she made so many babies too many i'm trying to say fuck that
02:02:21 fucking horse what what fluttershy in her i like fluttershy but uh it was 1 000 baby steps for a
02:02:30 pony one giant baby one giant baby for mankind all right okay so fair enough they're all teachers
02:02:38 okay they're all teachers twilight has like a weird like surely temple pony who is uncomfortable
02:02:45 and is like for like assistant in some weird bizarre way you see you open the door a crack and
02:02:50 you let in a star set sunshine glimmer or whatever and then the floodgates burst open all these
02:02:56 fucking weirdos there's a bunch of eclectic cafe-esque misfits and fucking morons there's like
02:03:03 there's yaks there's griffins there's dragons there's changelings all the races are intermittently
02:03:09 and the and the donald trump pony hates it that's hates it uh okay oh my god cozy cozy glows evil
02:03:18 cozy cozy is evil she uh wants power and she tries to summon t-rex uh and she traps twilight
02:03:24 in the co in hell and she traps them well the the the beast myth fits eclectic cafe members
02:03:31 have to uh try and like at least you know make it the people known that she is an evil imposter
02:03:37 and a dictator she imprisons she turns the masses against starlight glimmer who is a good personnel
02:03:43 she uses like kindness to manipulate people into liking her literally now gore toxic femininity
02:03:49 nice nice yeah yeah yeah i'm definitely not reading too much in this is definitely a pro jump
02:03:54 anti uh sjw episode hey i'm just saying uh looking at i'm on the villains i'm on the
02:03:59 villains wiki uh and i'm on cozy glows page and and and right above her image is a big red banner
02:04:06 labeling her in the category of evil doer so don't get confused hey i see is your kid mark a
02:04:12 unlike all the other villains on this on this week she is an evil doer rook in chess is that what
02:04:17 that is no no it looks like it looks like it might be it's kind of a spirit by her wing
02:04:24 type of villain tyrannical brat i mean that's a classification i just want to say that i i actually
02:04:31 like uh that idea for a story and i like her design and i think she's a cool character and i like her
02:04:36 ponies are good guys let's review the show let's like as in as in like watch oh maybe we should
02:04:41 maybe we should that was tame that was tame because that's just like like a massive departure
02:04:45 from the job then you go back to season seven yeah and it's fucking insane okay okay so twilight
02:04:50 sparkle likes star swirled the beard so she like plays god and brings stars swirled the beard no
02:04:56 back to life are you kidding me other mythical friends to just these historic people from the
02:05:04 olden days twilight brings them back to life what i guess typically she unseals them that's
02:05:09 literally fucking what's his face that's literally like what twilight did in remember what's that
02:05:14 fucking apple she ate too many apples and she had a psychedelic trip and there was an episode
02:05:19 for each of the other ponies too you know what i'm talking about max dot mauve dot mauve yeah
02:05:23 that's the one dot mauve whatever it's fucking twilight dot mauve magic dot mauve whatever
02:05:27 that's exactly what literally happened uh what the fuck they're all they're all labeled evil
02:05:32 doer every single one is labeled evil doer why have it um they're all they're all because if they
02:05:38 don't do evil they're good but this is the evil person wiki right like by default well that it
02:05:43 probably be like evil doer and redeemed doer i guess they're being thorough okay anyway so they're
02:05:48 bringing them back to life but but because they bring them back to life the pony of shadows the
02:05:53 villain the pony of shadows he is a pony who just is black and somewhat wispy that's his fucking name
02:06:00 is the pony of shadows no stop that's the guy he was the one that they said was in the castle in
02:06:05 that one where they're running around the castle castle mania oh that was real that finally means
02:06:10 materialized or something was real that was confirmed as a joke but i guess they turned it
02:06:14 into a oh isn't that great when you turn jokes into like actual plot points great i love that and
02:06:19 and yeah it's good it's actually better no it's not it was like it's like what it's like
02:06:23 these like to do with the party god and it sucked in adventure time no i mean you guys are bullshit
02:06:30 you're all bullshit you're all just going off hearsay from munchie all right i am caught up
02:06:34 with the show oh i haven't seen the season nine premiere but i've seen all the seasons seven and
02:06:39 guess what everyone in the world you fucking idiots yeah show's fucking fantastic it's still
02:06:43 fucking great okay one of the greatest cartoons ever made and it's it's it's amazing that it's
02:06:48 still great but it is still great and no one will ever know because all anyone will ever know about
02:06:52 the show is bronies and how stupid they are and this is this incredible gem of a creation this
02:06:58 wonderful artistic little masterpiece of a cartoon will never will never get its respect will never
02:07:04 get its proper due it's fucking great hey man teabab resurrection gave it its props it was good
02:07:10 it's a good show it was finally acknowledged it sounds like the way the analysis was the
02:07:14 comic section of my i don't know if i was making like a value judgment on it i just think it's crazy
02:07:19 that so much has changed and there's so many weird different storylines i never would have expected
02:07:24 and that it was so i was caught off guard it is crazy yeah okay that's what is that's what i still
02:07:30 love about it is that like the show is so different from what it was when it started and like for
02:07:36 for like a cartoon that is for like things technically for stupid technically for stupid
02:07:41 baby toddlers uh but like for it to have like so much ongoing depth and narrative and continuity
02:07:47 and like it's a totally different show now it's a good show hey hey i'm with everyone i mean i
02:07:52 mean i believe you on all that i'm just curious what's the cmc up to what's what's their arc right
02:07:56 now are they doing anything they had like they started their own camp to like help other ponies
02:08:01 get their cutie marks sure sure which i which i which i did think was stupid and it is actually a bad
02:08:07 show okay right that i said uh yeah that's what they did okay all right fair enough that seems
02:08:14 i feel like like a like a concentration camp yeah that's what kind of camp it was concentrate
02:08:20 really hard on the concentrate all these fucking blank flanks they're just want to eliminate them
02:08:24 from the populace uh they they grab their trowels and their bricks and their mortars and they're
02:08:29 building dude imagine all the ponies they're like they're they're all blank flanks they bring them in
02:08:32 but when they enter the camp they all get like the you know like the badges that the concentration
02:08:37 kit like the star the star for the jews like the pink heart whatever uh oh yeah we got it we got it
02:08:44 we got it we got to get rid of all these blank all these blank flanks are just coming over the
02:08:47 border and taking our jobs and taking the lack of jobs because they have no talents exactly yeah
02:08:54 yeah we can't uh i guess it comes back to the nurture versus nature uh facet of of the synopsis
02:09:01 for season nine the first the two-parter and it's pretty insane okay all right let's let's check it
02:09:07 out people we'll have an educated opinion one of these days i feel like the i may be the reason
02:09:15 the reason that um my little pony can get so crazy is is literally because
02:09:21 of it being like a show kind of for babies that is not supposed to be really serious
02:09:26 because they can it for like from a writing perspective you've got all these silly ponies
02:09:32 and they do all these ridiculous things and um anything you want you can you can just throw in
02:09:38 there but because generally from the beginning since lauren faust is it faust or forced i can't
02:09:45 remember faust um haven't said in so long uh lauren faust's like has a vision and she got like
02:09:54 certain writers who she she felt like you know that could could make it like an actually good
02:10:00 show that sort of has been carried on uh through all the seasons where it's like they can have fun
02:10:07 but you know they don't need to they don't need to be too serious but because they don't need to
02:10:13 be they can you know they can choose to be serious when they want to and that's why things get so
02:10:18 crazy but the quality of the show doesn't get stupid because it's not like it's not like a game
02:10:23 of thrones where people are like it has to be really good in a very specific way and if it goes
02:10:29 silly or like has a bad episode or something people people wouldn't go apeshit if my little pony
02:10:35 has a bad episode here or there they're just sort of you know what i mean like it's like under the
02:10:39 radar and that's why it can do all these crazy things and it's fine it's like even to this day
02:10:43 like in the hasbro offices when they're all making the show you know even though lauren faust
02:10:47 hasn't been there in all these different years there's there's there's probably like a big
02:10:51 like words written on the wall like big words that everyone can see that's like a quote from
02:10:56 lauren faust that says don't forget don't be shit and so everyone knows when they're making the show
02:11:02 they know not to make it shit and if every show had a guiding principle like that then every show
02:11:08 would be great god the whole uh i've only ever had the wisdom to say don't be shit the whole
02:11:14 contents of the show bible just contains one sentence a full blank page and then the one
02:11:18 sentence don't forget don't be shit it's real you need to know collect the link in the description
02:11:23 to see some nightmare fuel uh there you go please do uh okay but let's move on to our
02:11:28 couple of last voicemails we got here people um we've got another one here oh i forgot to
02:11:33 record in the show for a second there i understand what wait what possibly could have been the last
02:11:40 voicemail what yeah possibly why did we start talking about it was okay the last one was comments
02:11:46 our sin uh and and forget it just yeah yeah it's a mystery wait i'm curious because i i have
02:11:53 forgotten you have to listen to the episode no wait a minute a fate worse than death is listening
02:11:58 to my own podcast agreed um okay but here's uh here's one from art director 69 uh okay go
02:12:08 hey guys i have a question um so like i was at home and listening to the podcast and then my friend
02:12:12 was fucking his girlfriend too loudly so i came out here to record this uh so i'm a zoomer right
02:12:16 like i'm on like i'm a zoomer uh i'm 19 and for a couple days like look at me i'm a zoomer uh
02:12:21 what point in time does someone become a zoomer or not like i have a game team for people who are
02:12:24 like old fucks or like 20 somethings but i'm a zoomer because i'm 19 right right right that's it
02:12:31 20 fucking 24 no 25 just the cutoff if you're if you're currently 25 or over you're not a zoomer
02:12:38 damn that's a pretty harsh uh cutoff i think that's i think it's a little high i think 25 barely not a
02:12:43 zoomer then i think 20 so i think this guy's got it right i don't know i i think 20 20 year old
02:12:51 are insufferable have you ever seen a 20 year old i don't want to zoomers i don't care to look upon them
02:12:58 i feel like 25 is about right okay i i i think that's too old i know the real answer i know the
02:13:03 real answer if you if you remember what you were doing on september 11th you are a millennial i
02:13:10 don't you're a zoomer okay that's fine yeah that works so i mean september 11th is the is the
02:13:15 is the cutoff point for all human history it's where it's before and after you would have had to
02:13:20 have been like maybe five or so on like september 11 so how old would you be now uh that was well
02:13:26 i don't remember it was like 23 23 or 24 something yeah yeah yeah all right i'll take that okay there

02:15:19 about it but we're looking to expand operations with this injection of new talent and we can't
02:15:24 do that if we're working with like shit fucking software and no programmers yeah i could also
02:15:32 use rempy programmers if uh we don't get enough code boys just so like you know like make it easier
02:15:38 on everyone involved but we need more fucking programmers and welcome to you viewer uh fuck
02:15:45 this podcast fuck the people on there all means to an end we need more programmers to program the
02:15:50 shit and that's it uh that that's all okay bye oh wait didgy uh i saw the video you did with may
02:15:57 it was really cute and adorable thanks for doing that okay that's all see you oh yeah they did a
02:16:02 playthrough um all right so viewer you know i mean i guess they're looking for programming talent
02:16:10 on the pcp dating sim is their twitter people i would probably the best way to get in touch would
02:16:16 be to message them on twi on the twitter probably i imagine so it's the only way i know how to contact
02:16:21 them so yeah um have they tried asking like the the many programmers involved in endless war
02:16:27 probably not because that's a that that's a large enough we need we need them maybe we need all their
02:16:32 energy uh but also probably maybe i don't i mean oh please just shut the hell up bro i
02:16:40 am games discord and there's a whole uh channel the i'm game discord specifically for game devin
02:16:45 programming and i haven't seen him fish for people there i mean this is an open source project
02:16:50 regardless so yeah i am games whatever uh endless war who gives a shit point is the call has gone
02:16:54 out people at pcp dating sim needs programmers if you are a programmer think about it see if

02:17:09 sick good good good call Tio Nate yelling voice Nate is forceful this is how I get
02:17:15 things done by escalating my volume okay anyway let's move on to the next call
02:17:20 thank you Joe thank you whole team on the dating sim next one is from Gator
02:17:25 inflator this message goes out to Tom Oliver in regards to the vertical slice
02:17:35 that he just released for a zoomie game quite enjoy it but suggestion the sword
02:17:41 the hitbox for the sword is way too fucking dinky it's you have to get in
02:17:45 way too close and it just doesn't go play strider and you'll see what I mean
02:17:50 that that man can fucking swing a sword out like 30 feet and it's just like you
02:17:55 got it's just the right amount of room I'm not saying exactly I get that she's
02:18:00 small but her sword doesn't need to fucking me like a little fish a little
02:18:05 floppy little fish give me incentive to use it over just spamming shirkins all
02:18:15 the time maybe put a limit on them or maybe make them a little slower or because
02:18:19 just I hang back I just use that instead it just feels so much better
02:18:23 lastly knockback it's a fucking it's it's it's too ninja-guidant for my taste
02:18:31 you fly back and just out but you don't have the invincibility frames Tom tighten
02:18:37 it up a little and it could be great the little raccoon which you could go far but
02:18:41 as it is thank you okay way this guy sounds like he wants an easy mode I
02:18:50 don't know if I can do that I suppose I think you I think you gotta tighten up
02:18:57 the graphics on level three oh fuck you're right yeah yeah that's some solid
02:19:02 feedback it sounds like you went to school for that dude like damn I'll uh you
02:19:07 know I await my check in the right I mean I'll say I mean I thought this was
02:19:12 relatively insightful and decent feedback I remember when I was playing
02:19:16 specifically I I suppose while the game still in development it's fair to
02:19:20 make you know critiques or whatever I agree that it feels like you do have to
02:19:24 get very close to enemies in order to hit them and considering like the
02:19:28 relatively large size of a zoomie I mean again maybe this is literally what
02:19:32 you're going for but I basically of like it feels like you're you got to get
02:19:37 real close to do a hit and it could theoretically be more satisfying to have
02:19:41 like a slightly larger hitbox which yeah I'm aware would require changing like
02:19:44 you know a bunch of stuff including the animation itself but I don't know just
02:19:48 saying that seems like reasonable suggestions would actually be
02:19:53 relatively simple to fix yeah okay you just gotta edit a couple frames and
02:19:57 then change the actual hitbox size do you use physical hitboxes for the damage
02:20:01 calculations yeah okay cool cool oh I'm curious because I don't know well you
02:20:06 know okay what I what I mean is a fitbox as opposed to like I mean some people
02:20:09 use like ray tracing or stuff and that's a that's another method of calculating
02:20:13 damage hits and whatnot but like I was curious if like because there's there's
02:20:17 images that get posted like game dev threads on V and stuff of like the
02:20:21 different games with like the different styles of hitboxes do you have one
02:20:24 hitbox do you have stacked hitboxes to like because if they're rectangles you
02:20:28 got to stack them to emulate like a circle shape or Smash Bros actually uses
02:20:32 circles themselves so I'm curious what would you use for the vertical slice
02:20:38 they're all just a single square and they approximate the size pretty pretty
02:20:42 well I mean the the sword swings in the game that you use the area is can be
02:20:49 covered with a square pretty effectively I didn't see a need to stack squares yeah
02:20:54 that's um I figured like if it extended a little bit beyond the animation itself
02:20:59 like I'd rather have people like wow I can't believe that hit they're like oh
02:21:02 that's bullshit that sort of hit yeah kind of like overcompensate instead of
02:21:06 undercompensated probably good yeah but yeah I mean the the shuriken thing is
02:21:12 probably the thing that I want to address like that's something that is
02:21:16 planned to to be changed yeah right now the reason not to use them is they do
02:21:20 like so little damage compared to the sword but you can just kind of sit back
02:21:24 and just spam them if you want to it just kind of gets boring but you know I
02:21:29 mean that's a that could potentially be like a criticism of the game that's like
02:21:33 even though like the game might feel boring to play that way to more cautious
02:21:37 players like especially on like the first playthrough if you're just trying to
02:21:40 get through the game like if the game incentivizes you to do a most boring
02:21:43 option because it's super safe then you might want to funnel into that there
02:21:47 actually is a bunch of logic right now turned off that controls inventory like
02:21:52 one of the conditions for throwing the shurikens you should have ammo I just
02:21:55 didn't get around to adding in the ammo yeah at some point there are supposed to
02:21:58 be kind of like in a shinobi for the Genesis like I mean the Sekiro is the
02:22:03 same way kind of Sekiro like the shurikens are kind of OP in some
02:22:07 situations but you only have like 17 at a time so right when when did this
02:22:11 vertical slice release like yesterday oh shit well why don't we put that in the
02:22:15 fucking show notes god damn it wait yeah yeah yeah where can they find it it's on
02:22:23 itch itch.io so it's Tom Oliver itch.io slash Izumi and it's the pinned tweet on
02:22:29 my Twitter so there you go there you go all right I'm gonna I'm gonna check that
02:22:34 out fucking neat. It does have controller support now which everyone was very
02:22:39 adamant on adding so if you plug in your Xbox controller if you can play with a
02:22:42 controller not a keyboard if you're that so inclined. Controller babies. Ben's of a
02:22:47 higher grade. We need to respect players by adding controller support wrong okay
02:22:54 oh god damn it I posted a keyboard mouse and keyboard please. I've posted the
02:23:00 fucking audio link in the wrong okay whatever I just posted the link to the
02:23:03 thing in the show notes so people have it okay but anyway moving on next voice
02:23:08 mail we're wrong I think we got like three or four left Izumi and the vertical
02:23:12 slice that's really funny oh okay solid snake one solid snake is calling in oh
02:23:20 my god it's exciting let's let's get to it go.
02:23:25 Colonel I've managed to sneak in to PCPHQ which was tough as it doesn't exist
02:23:32 and likely never will but regardless I'm in and wait what's that on the floor is
02:23:42 that my god it's the body of Andrew Yang oh no he's been force-fed heavy cream
02:23:51 oh man how could you he's covered in snake bites I was my god I was I was
02:24:00 middle gear solid them twin snakes
02:24:10 oh no I forgot to tell you about the fucking poison gas room sorry I know
02:24:16 that's kind of important but I forgot you're now just dying a poisonous gas
02:24:20 right now that my experience he was he was like he was dying of poison and he
02:24:26 asked me he asked me to suck the poison out of his wounds but I thought that
02:24:29 sounded a little gay so I just said no here drink this heavy cream instead
02:24:32 it's good for what else you know the electrical floor room yeah sorry the
02:24:40 room where people just shoot you automatically just entering I forgot I've
02:24:44 got a guillotine if we decapitate you it'll be really easy to drain the poison
02:24:48 out of you and then we can reattach the head afterward this is the only way to
02:24:51 go there you go that's that's there you go yeah solid okay moving on thanks
02:24:57 solid snake appreciate that okay here we go this is a this is a bit of a spooky
02:25:02 one the biological clock on Nate's branding I saw this in the evening I
02:25:08 was curious about what this let's let's hear what they have to say Ben is
02:25:12 losing all his hair and Nate is Ben's brother yeah you know lead related but
02:25:18 unlike Ben Nate's hair is a part of his brand it's on his avatar so Nate what
02:25:25 are you gonna do if and when you lose your hair gonna wear a wig maybe implants
02:25:31 or some shit you know your shit's in danger you're you're you have a
02:25:36 biological clock on your avatar I'm what's your contingency plan here man all
02:25:41 right I well hey regardless no wait hold on hold on listen I listen guys listen I
02:25:50 am you know what I'm fucking argue I'm not argue this I my I just have a huge
02:26:00 forehead I just always have a huge forehead is it's the same what is a huge
02:26:05 but the absence of hair to cover it listen yeah my hair my hair is seated
02:26:09 when I was a baby my hairline my hairline just went way back up there and
02:26:13 gave me a giant forehead and you know it's fine and I'm gonna have this you know
02:26:16 and my hair my hair my forehead will be just as giant the day I fucking die
02:26:20 your claim then at 80 at 89 years old of a fucking of a fucking eyeball popping
02:26:28 out because I sneeze too relevant to me but but if you if your claim is simply
02:26:32 that your hairline has not receded anytime recently then fair enough I'm
02:26:36 sure you know people could probably I don't know the data could be compiled
02:26:40 you know I I have I okay now I could be crazy I could be imagining it but I look
02:26:46 at pictures of myself in like high school and I've got like a fucking giant
02:26:50 forehead and like the same like it's it's like kind of yeah I've got the sort of
02:26:54 it's not a widow's peak but like I know what you mean like it goes kind of like
02:26:59 up on the sides like it sort of sticks out front yeah but it's I mean it's
02:27:03 pretty much the same so I'm okay I'm going I'm going I'm going great really
02:27:08 fast like at a rapidly accelerating pace but you know that's fine that's
02:27:12 different it's all the heavy cream you know I thought about this a little bit
02:27:16 because I mean my hair is tied to my brand a lot more than Nate's is to his
02:27:21 I'm known as the long hair even if I just got a short haircut that would be
02:27:26 like what's going on but you know like I'm I'm a man I'm probably gonna lose
02:27:32 my hair and I think that the solution is to just rebrand and just be an old
02:27:37 person because if red letter media has taught me anything is that it doesn't
02:27:42 matter what you look like as long as you're funny and I am funny so I'll be
02:27:45 you know you know I that is totally fair but you know what there there's a
02:27:49 reality to be addressed of just just for example if you've got a really hot
02:27:53 chick and she's like a host on a show or whatever if she begins to become not
02:27:58 hot even if the other hosts are like straight-up ugly that will be very
02:28:02 noticeable to the audience let's say she starts to get fat or just stops wearing
02:28:06 makeup or anything like that people notice similarly I think I have kind of
02:28:10 look earned or not I think I have something of a reputation of like of like
02:28:15 the hot one and again I'm not saying that I deserve that I think that frankly
02:28:21 workout it's it works you're the you're like the fit yes deservedly or not I'm
02:28:26 working on it guys I swear I really am right now but don't look at me in real
02:28:30 life but so yeah I mean like in the PCB demo like I'm huge and muscly and stuff
02:28:35 which okay I do work out whatever I'm not gonna get to that the point is on like
02:28:40 if I I'm somewhat associated with like looking relatively handsome and I think
02:28:45 that like if my hair does start to go away I that will impact it so I thought
02:28:50 about that one thing to do is to rebrand I don't really want to do that I
02:28:54 could like I if I had no other option I could definitely do that and I've
02:28:58 actually been thinking about this about how my avatar is tied to hair and some
02:29:02 people have been roasting me on it whether it's appropriate or not how is
02:29:04 your avatar what do you mean how is your habits are tied well it just has hair
02:29:08 it's all like if I went bald it would be weird to keep using an avatar that just
02:29:12 had hair don't you think I I mean isn't it isn't it kind of lame to use the same
02:29:19 avatar forever and ever and ever anyway I mean probably you'd want to switch it
02:29:22 up eventually yeah you'd be like a wrestler going through I mean I mean
02:29:26 that's fair I'm mad because my hair is falling out fuck the world here's a
02:29:30 video game you know that's true and as a YouTube you know you'll you know you know
02:29:33 I'm this is a business opportunity for me because when you go bald that means
02:29:38 you'll have to get me to draw you a new avid so that's fair that's just money in
02:29:40 my pocket but you know what the thing is and maybe I made it do that but I've
02:29:44 thought about this there have been stories I haven't verified this of how
02:29:48 Elon Musk like seemed to be going bald when he was younger but right now he
02:29:53 has a beautiful full head of hair I think the technology has advanced you
02:29:57 got implants I mean implants or whatever it is I'm telling you right now I don't
02:30:02 mind about everyone talks about baldness like they've never fucking even heard
02:30:07 that implants exist like they exist they've existed people start to go bald
02:30:12 and then they just get their fucking hair back it's not even complicated you go
02:30:16 you pay like a thousand two thousand whatever dollars or whatever I mean I
02:30:20 just put your hair back in I think it's pretty fucking expensive I'm probably
02:30:23 expensive but I mean it exists it's weird that people act surprised like if
02:30:28 you're gonna save up to buy a new car you know that's one that you do you'd save
02:30:31 up you know buy hair implants if it's important I mean women do it with like
02:30:34 you know breast implants I just as an example you know similar sort of thing
02:30:38 and I think it's relatively similar to that and so I'll tell you people I I've
02:30:43 considered it and I don't think like obviously I'm whatever I'm doing fine
02:30:46 right now but like it's just there's such a weird thing of like it's it's like
02:30:51 shameful to do it you know like it's like embarrassing like unfortunate but I
02:30:56 don't know well women where we that has to be destroyed we have to fuck that I
02:31:01 think we should have an option when you're going bald it's it's like you're
02:31:07 game overing on life and then the implants is like do you want to go to
02:31:12 easy mode if I go bald before I'm 40 I'm starting a fucking go fund me for
02:31:24 hair implants fuck I will not have you guys I don't have you guys seen you guys
02:31:29 seen community you know Jeff from community main guy yeah Joel Mikhail
02:31:34 the handsome one he's a you ever you ever seen him before his hair implants
02:31:40 that guy had a that guy had a mess so that actor got implants when he was like
02:31:46 younger or something definitely because there's there's there's like much oh
02:31:50 there's much he looks like fucking Sheldon but like look up like look up
02:31:57 like pre hair implant like Joel Mikhail sometime and like you know like that guy
02:32:03 would not get leading right it's just a deciding factor on oh my god I see the
02:32:08 images right now they are yeah right you oh my Jesus like and he's like us he's
02:32:13 like a leading man now he's like one of the he is like known for being handsome
02:32:17 now you got a post I'm posting it in the links for right now look at this here's
02:32:23 one yeah or like how about this one over here there's another one and like his
02:32:29 hair's still back that's that's actually that's less dramatic than I that's less
02:32:32 dramatic than I remember look at this next I mean I don't know he's he's still
02:32:37 got a giant fucking for you know this guy this guy went from tool to cool in one
02:32:43 simple step and the step was being rich so I mean that's fair you know what so
02:32:48 I'm just gonna tell people right now I'm gonna I'm gonna make it man I'm gonna do
02:32:51 whatever it takes and frankly I got aspirations to do things and be more
02:32:56 widely known and if hair is gonna get in the way I will get implants in a
02:33:00 fucking heartbeat if I know all packed right now we're all fucking
02:33:04 sign it never go bald okay the only reason I won't sign that right now is
02:33:10 cuz when I if I if I reach this moment I might want to go the Joe Rogan like
02:33:14 ripped bald guy route and like see how that goes that's the only thing that I
02:33:17 think I kind of like that's nothing wrong no I love two minds on the subject
02:33:25 like cuz like I always like I always thought George Carlin looked cool when
02:33:29 he was like sort of balding and like like Jerome Flynn the guy who plays
02:33:32 brawn on Game of Thrones yeah yeah he looks cool he so like I always thought
02:33:36 that like if I'm in my 40s and it starts to go I'll just be cool like whatever
02:33:40 exactly but like if I'm if I feel like it's happening too soon fuck that I'm
02:33:46 getting it fixed yeah yeah I feel yeah I feel so we could at least make the pack
02:33:50 of the no shame the no shame well here's the thing the moment I like go like
02:33:57 start to be like embarrassing bold I will shave my head and then I will grow
02:34:00 my beard oh yeah yeah good plan I know I can do that that's true okay if I
02:34:05 decided to to make that demonic packed take that fousty bargain and switched
02:34:10 and switch on easy mode because the hair loss was just too too much to handle I
02:34:15 might be tempted to over correct and bring it down like bring my hair line
02:34:20 down like further than it ever was to begin with like like all the way down
02:34:25 shows up looking like the old-timey wolf man like hoping no one notices
02:34:29 anything's different like hey guys well we'll think about we'll think about this
02:34:34 remember okay remember Harry Potter right any anyone anyone else remember
02:34:39 Harry I don't know which time like remember when Hermione got her like
02:34:43 teeth knocked out or something and then no no she got shrunk she got them shrunk
02:34:47 she got her teeth cursed and her teeth became right and she went to like
02:34:51 Madame Hootcher whatever the nurse's name was and she had them shrink her
02:34:54 teeth and she just let me sort of like make them a little make make them a
02:34:58 little smaller than they started where I'm gonna go I'm gonna be like hey bring
02:35:01 my hair line down here and then just keep just keep going and then it'll just
02:35:06 come all the way down to my it'll just blend right into my way you know what
02:35:09 though Ben this is why the reasons like this are exactly why I want to have money
02:35:14 like a bunch of money so I can make these kind of fixes in my life if and
02:35:19 when necessary that's freedom baby sure freedom yeah that's what money's for
02:35:23 yeah to fix the things that go wrong yeah that's what I think sure I think yeah
02:35:27 totally now I agree okay so I guess let's move on are we done got another
02:35:32 I don't have to think about this for at least you got ten years for sure unless
02:35:37 something happens some people are unlucky but that I don't know man okay
02:35:41 anyway anyway let's check in again ladies and gentlemen it's time for riddle my
02:35:45 ass Batman everybody's okay and go episode redeemed holy bolly parasite
02:35:55 Batman I got your message I'm on my way now what about man who what my winter was
02:36:01 near once called his computer my ticket out of here you don't mention him by
02:36:05 name for he does not see fame call him a loon for he's a roller coaster tycoon
02:36:10 he was not elected by his part of the collective your windows are too easy
02:36:14 Batman it's the new collective
02:36:18 yeah well done Batman release and minions thanks Batman and maybe the first to
02:36:24 welcome you to the Voo Collective resistance to die I would never resist a
02:36:28 Voo Collective to Voo you've been waiting for this all my life and then I
02:36:32 remember the PCP saved and now I remember the PCP of the Voo Collective
02:36:36 same PCP time same PCP channel
02:36:41 exciting adventure called the riddler Batman on accident I like the fuck-ups
02:36:50 and the just stuttering and whatnot I like how fussy as he just doesn't just
02:36:55 know down at all to catch his own no also the beginning about like I'll be
02:37:00 right there I think we're introducing Robin into the arc I think that's what
02:37:03 that was that was definitely Robin I think we're setting up for a big change
02:37:06 in the paradigm and I don't know I'm I'm ready for a narrative it's not like
02:37:13 the riddler has Batman and Batman has to answer nine riddles and then he's
02:37:18 released every single time he's released again and then assuming he is just
02:37:23 captured again releasing the PCP he's releasing the members of the PCP
02:37:29 there of his own free will indeed he's free he's free he's trying to save us
02:37:33 okay right okay I understand nice job he's a good man good it flew over my head
