00:00:00 Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemail for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Redcon funded by you. We can be Pro Crastinators.
00:00:18 Hello everybody and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. We're just starting. We're just gonna fucking go.
00:00:26 The only podcast you ever need. This is the only one you need to listen to. All the rest, they're just suggestions. This is the one you listen to on repeat from now until the end of time. It's great.
00:00:38 The only mandatory podcast.
00:00:42 Whoa, who's that? Is that Ben Saint?
00:00:44 It's me. It's Ben Saint. I'm alive. I survived another week.
00:00:50 The only podcast that has lamp oil, rope, bombs, if you want them, you have to listen to the entire thing.
00:01:00 True.
00:01:01 And who's that? Who's that piping in from the back?
00:01:04 It's me, Morshu.
00:01:07 What?
00:01:08 Whomps?
00:01:09 What?
00:01:10 Morshu from The Legend of Zelda CD-i, the guy who says lamp oil, rope, bombs, you want it?
00:01:17 I didn't know we had a guest on today's episode.
00:01:20 Yeah, but put Eleazar, put the Morshu in the corner. He's the new PCP guy with his old-
00:01:27 Oh fuck.
00:01:29 After all that work to make a legally distinct PCP guy.
00:01:32 There is no PCP guy. We changed the form out. It's Tombstones now. We're Tombstones. Put them on a Tombstone.
00:01:37 Where's the PCP guy Tombstone? Is he dead? Is he at large?
00:01:43 When you come into the graveyard, there's an archway and it's like a wrought iron arch.
00:01:48 It says procrastinator's graveyard over and in the middle there's a little engraving.
00:01:55 There's an engraving and it's his face. That's him. That's where he's at. He's overseeing the afterlife.
00:02:01 There's all this description. Sounds like how you would play a text-based game. I only do graphics, graphics only. I don't read, so...
00:02:08 I play Noida. That has pixels.
00:02:13 It does. Moving up in the world.
00:02:16 I've become addicted to the feeling of getting a really fast wand online, of getting castaway down to zero and just getting a chainsaw.
00:02:28 And just piss bullets everywhere. I need it. I need that thrill.
00:02:33 And if I start a run and I don't find chainsaws, I'm like, oh god, I'm so weak.
00:02:40 I feel weak right now because I'm not blasting damage at beasts.
00:02:45 I want to blast both of you. I just want to tear you apart.
00:02:50 Is that why Twitter's been a war zone for the last 10 days? You've just been blasting everybody?
00:02:56 I've just put my chainsaw on my spark bolt and my spitter bolt and I just...
00:03:02 No, it's not my fault. I didn't do anything. I've done nothing wrong. I apologize for nothing. Everyone else is wrong.
00:03:09 And I'm not even kidding. I'm serious.
00:03:14 I just sit here. I just respond to life as it comes at me in the only reasonable way.
00:03:22 Ben just sits there, buys keyboard with his couple of gallons of gasoline
00:03:27 and every time he sees an opportunity, just pours a little bit on something.
00:03:31 I disagree with this characterization. No, I'm innocent. I'm innocent of everything.
00:03:41 Okay, good.
00:03:43 Okay.
00:03:45 No, everyone...
00:03:47 I've been looking at all that stuff and I'm like, whatever.
00:03:53 Personally, I'm too physically deteriorated to care about whatever is happening.
00:03:59 God, I wish I were that physically deteriorated.
00:04:03 I've been this last week ravaged in a non-sexual way, which is the worst kind of way.
00:04:11 Ravaged in a digital way, with a bout of disease of some kind.
00:04:19 It's not a disease, really. It's just like I'm stupid.
00:04:22 Tell me more. Tell me about your disease.
00:04:26 It's called not eating or drinking properly and it's destroyed me.
00:04:34 Well, I mean, ultimately, I think that was what it was, because I don't know.
00:04:39 I'm living in a new place, right?
00:04:41 I said I was living in a new place and I'm like, okay, I'm cooking food for myself.
00:04:46 I can cook food, that's fine.
00:04:48 I think it's just something about the dryness in the room or something that I'm not used to.
00:04:53 And I got really dehydrated and I didn't notice, because I don't notice things.
00:05:01 So I got so dehydrated and it wasn't even warm, so I was not even thinking about that being a thing.
00:05:11 And then I started vomiting and it was the worst.
00:05:15 Every morning was agony, getting through the day.
00:05:18 It was all I could do to survive.
00:05:23 I was just like, and all of this time, stuff was happening on Twitter.
00:05:27 I'm like, you know, I could think.
00:05:30 Nothing.
00:05:31 But I don't have the energy to do that.
00:05:34 I just need to live right now.
00:05:37 I just want to try. Nothing actually happens on Twitter.
00:05:40 Things happen off of Twitter and then people go to Twitter to bitch at me about things that happened elsewhere.
00:05:47 And then I spend the rest of the day replying to idiots who don't see that I'm the only rational actor.
00:05:55 That's what's going on.
00:05:57 Don't get it twisted, but okay.
00:06:00 Excuse me.
00:06:01 Sure, whatever.
00:06:02 Yeah, whatever.
00:06:03 It's just a bunch of something.
00:06:06 This is an opinion I could have on it.
00:06:08 I don't really know what it would be.
00:06:10 I just want to live.
00:06:11 I just want to stop feeling pain.
00:06:13 I feel a little better today.
00:06:16 God, it sucks.
00:06:18 I don't understand.
00:06:19 When a physical ailment gets here, there's nothing else matters.
00:06:22 I don't understand.
00:06:23 You're saying you were simply dehydrated.
00:06:26 Dude, dehydration will fuck with you.
00:06:28 No, no, no.
00:06:29 It's dehydrated.
00:06:30 Well, it got to a point where, you know, that like...
00:06:33 Does dehydration make you throw up?
00:06:36 It makes...
00:06:37 Well, I don't know.
00:06:38 All right.
00:06:39 Here's what I assume was the series of events.
00:06:42 It was dehydration which caused constipation,
00:06:46 which made it difficult to eat things
00:06:48 and to drink things without like,
00:06:50 like eventually throwing up.
00:06:52 I'm like, okay, I can't keep things down,
00:06:54 but I need to ingest and I can't.
00:06:57 And I had to go to the hospital to get like water pumped into my veins.
00:07:02 Did they intubate you?
00:07:03 They intubated you.
00:07:05 They put a IV or whatever into my vein
00:07:09 and I almost fainted because I'm scared of the blood
00:07:11 and the blood came out of me and I was like,
00:07:13 oh, no, no, no, I need to lie down.
00:07:15 No, no, no, I need that.
00:07:17 Put it back in, please.
00:07:19 Yeah, sure.
00:07:21 Yeah, it was the scariest thing of all time,
00:07:24 getting treated at a hospital.
00:07:26 I couldn't, you know,
00:07:30 dissuade people from going to hospital more
00:07:33 than the scariest of it all.
00:07:35 Definitely don't go to the hospital.
00:07:37 This is a PCP official advice.
00:07:39 Don't go to the shoplift and don't go to the doctor.
00:07:41 Just, just die.
00:07:43 And don't go to college.
00:07:45 Disavow.
00:07:47 But the rest I disavow.
00:07:49 It's funny.
00:07:51 Yeah, it was fine.
00:07:53 I mean, it wasn't fine, but it's finer than it was.
00:07:56 I now know that I'm stupid and I should drink more
00:07:59 and that I've got to eat proper meals
00:08:02 even when I feel sick because if you don't eat,
00:08:04 you don't have fuel, you can't fight anything
00:08:06 when you don't have fuel, it just makes everything worse.
00:08:08 It gets you to a point where you can't recover naturally.
00:08:12 You know?
00:08:14 I don't, I still don't quite, but you didn't,
00:08:16 you didn't need to eat.
00:08:17 You didn't need fuel.
00:08:18 It was confusing.
00:08:19 You didn't need fuel to fight off a disease.
00:08:21 You just needed to drink fucking water.
00:08:23 That's all you needed.
00:08:25 No, it's confusing because like,
00:08:27 I feel like I also have a cold and it's not corona
00:08:30 because we have COVID tests and I took one just in case.
00:08:33 I don't have COVID, but like,
00:08:35 I feel like I've had a cold
00:08:37 and this, it's always multiple things.
00:08:41 It's never just, oh, you have this one symptom.
00:08:44 This means you have this one ailment
00:08:46 and this is this one solution.
00:08:48 It's always like, I do the one solution
00:08:50 and it turns out I have another thing
00:08:52 that's also like, that's not the solution.
00:08:55 So I should like do two solutions to these things,
00:08:59 but they might contradict.
00:09:01 I don't know.
00:09:02 I hate medicals.
00:09:03 I hate science.
00:09:05 Fucking doctors.
00:09:07 They're so smart.
00:09:09 You should have tried to,
00:09:10 you should have prayed the dehydration away instead.
00:09:15 I should have.
00:09:16 Yeah.
00:09:17 Good job.
00:09:18 Thanks.
00:09:19 You wouldn't have to go to the hospital then, huh?
00:09:20 You didn't even think about that one?
00:09:22 Maybe if I just like sliced open all of my limbs
00:09:26 and drank the blood,
00:09:27 that would cure my dehydration because it would be liquid.
00:09:30 Because then you'd have less blood that needs water,
00:09:33 but also your blood would be the water.
00:09:36 I just recycle.
00:09:37 It's recycling.
00:09:38 It's like green energy basically.
00:09:40 You should drink your pee too.
00:09:44 Disappear.
00:09:45 Disappear.
00:09:46 The drinking pee is like something I do on the rig anyway.
00:09:49 Don't shoplift.
00:09:50 It's like a normal day to day.
00:09:51 Don't go to the doctor.
00:09:52 Don't go to the hospital.
00:09:53 Don't go to college and drink your pee.
00:09:55 Why would you drink your pee
00:09:56 if you could just shoplift a drink by your own code?
00:10:01 Why would you...
00:10:03 I mean, well...
00:10:06 Fuck.
00:10:07 Disappear.
00:10:08 Disappear.
00:10:09 No, no.
00:10:10 Eleazar, cut this whole thing.
00:10:12 Cut the entire episode out.
00:10:13 We're starting over.
00:10:14 Start over, please.
00:10:16 Cut my life.
00:10:17 Do pieces.
00:10:19 No, no, no.
00:10:20 That's not the right song.
00:10:21 The song for this situation is clearly
00:10:22 get down with the sickness.
00:10:23 That's the entire summary of what happened.
00:10:28 There's this small moments of early morning
00:10:31 where I'm feeling weak
00:10:33 and I need to make myself breakfast or whatever
00:10:37 so that I have energy.
00:10:38 But I'm like, there's no way out of this.
00:10:41 This is the end.
00:10:43 I'm hollowing in real time and I'm like,
00:10:46 you know what would be nice right now?
00:10:48 It's like a bottom of a muddy ditch
00:10:50 and I could just throw myself into it
00:10:52 and fade away.
00:10:54 Nobody would ever find me.
00:10:56 I could just like, that's just what I need right now.
00:11:01 You ever feel like that?
00:11:02 You ever feel like just crawling into a space and dying?
00:11:06 I don't know what not feeling like that is like anymore.
00:11:09 It's been too long.
00:11:11 Oh, my man.
00:11:15 You know, when you play Dark Souls
00:11:17 and you go and the Skeleton Men,
00:11:20 like right outside Firelitron.
00:11:22 I feel like a Skeleton Man.
00:11:24 It's like when you're playing Noida
00:11:26 and you don't have any chainsaws
00:11:28 and your wand is just doing a little pew-pew-pew
00:11:30 and you're like, this fucking sucks.
00:11:32 I just want to kill everything.
00:11:33 You know, it's more like when you're playing Minesweeper
00:11:36 and you lapse in judgment for one second,
00:11:39 you click on mine,
00:11:40 because you just didn't count.
00:11:43 Three, you counted two and you were an idiot.
00:11:46 You were right at the end of an evil-sized Minesweeper thing.
00:11:49 You don't have to explain Minesweeper to me.
00:11:51 I'm an expert now.
00:11:54 Have you been playing it?
00:11:55 I don't know anything about it.
00:11:56 I'm an idiot.
00:11:57 Simple, you click on the squares
00:11:59 and then you get frustrated.
00:12:02 Yeah, yeah, that's right.
00:12:04 That's it.
00:12:05 You missed the bonus episode where I became a Minesweeper
00:12:10 and Picross Master.
00:12:13 I was tutored.
00:12:14 I was tutored in the ways, in the mystic arts.

00:12:29 What a time to be alive.
00:12:31 What a time for the PCP.
00:12:32 I said it before the episode.
00:12:33 I'll say it again.
00:12:34 We have entered the funniest era of the show,
00:12:37 in my opinion,
00:12:39 and I cannot be dissuaded from this opinion.
00:12:45 It's all coming up roses.
00:12:47 Great, it's looking up from here.
00:12:51 I don't know.
00:12:52 What's the argument here?
00:12:54 Where's the evidence to this claim?
00:12:56 The jokes.
00:12:57 I don't see it.
00:12:59 Come on, Ben.
00:13:00 Where's the funny?
00:13:01 Come with the funny.
00:13:02 It's not like ha ha funny.
00:13:04 It's funny like a...
00:13:07 Is it sad funny, like pathetic funny?
00:13:10 It's funny like when you're at a funeral
00:13:12 and you can't help laughing for some reason.
00:13:14 It's funny like it's like rain on my wedding day.
00:13:19 It's ironic.
00:13:21 It's a free ride that you just couldn't pay.
00:13:23 That's exactly what I'm saying.
00:13:25 I'm on your wavelength.
00:13:27 That's the new wave.
00:13:31 That's what it's going to be like from now on.
00:13:33 Trixie quit.
00:13:35 Trixie quit is what I'm saying.
00:13:37 And I think it's really funny.
00:13:41 I don't know if I'd say it's funny.
00:13:43 I think it's funny.
00:13:45 Well, I think it's unfortunate.
00:13:48 I am glad.
00:13:50 I'll just say it.
00:13:51 I'll just say it.
00:13:52 I'm glad.
00:13:53 Good.
00:13:54 It's good.
00:13:55 No, no, no apologies.
00:13:56 I didn't do anything wrong.
00:13:59 That's...
00:14:00 I don't care if she's mad at me.
00:14:02 She should be.
00:14:04 No way.
00:14:05 That's not what I meant to say.
00:14:06 I mean, she...
00:14:07 I should be mad, but I'm not.
00:14:11 Fucker.
00:14:12 Fucker is what I'm saying.
00:14:14 She's weird.
00:14:15 She's weird and I don't want to work with her.
00:14:17 And it's good.
00:14:19 She...
00:14:22 She can't fucking...
00:14:23 She can't hang.
00:14:24 She can't hang, so she's gone.
00:14:25 And that's what's up.
00:14:27 Ben, this is when I was talking about the gas
00:14:29 and the pouring the gas.
00:14:30 This is what I was talking about.
00:14:32 No, no.
00:14:33 This is...
00:14:34 I said...
00:14:35 People ask like,
00:14:36 are you gonna talk about this on the podcast?
00:14:40 What am I gonna not mention it?
00:14:42 I must.
00:14:43 I must acknowledge.
00:14:44 We must acknowledge the facts of the universe
00:14:46 that we now inhabit.
00:14:47 Of the dark timeline that we find ourselves in.
00:14:52 I don't know.
00:14:53 I mean, I don't feel like celebrating it necessarily.
00:14:56 I wouldn't mind if Trixie felt like coming back.
00:14:58 Like, I would be okay with her being on the show again.
00:15:03 I'd rather she didn't, but whatever.
00:15:06 Oh, you...
00:15:07 Everyone's entitled to their opinions, I suppose.
00:15:10 I don't know what caused this schism all of a sudden.
00:15:12 I don't know how everyone became enemies.
00:15:14 I'm very confused.
00:15:15 Well, you...
00:15:16 Well, you saw...
00:15:17 I mean, Alex, you saw the conversation we were having.
00:15:21 I saw...
00:15:22 And you saw...
00:15:23 And you saw the tweet she made immediately afterwards.
00:15:26 So, you've got all the pieces.
00:15:28 I guess.
00:15:30 I just don't understand how, like,
00:15:34 eight years of knowing someone can explode in a fireball
00:15:37 of, like, Radcon reward fallout.
00:15:40 It's very strange.
00:15:41 You know, it's not...
00:15:42 I don't know if that's entirely it.
00:15:44 Her tweet made it sound like it was all about that,
00:15:46 but it really wasn't.
00:15:48 Maybe I don't know what tweet you're talking about then,
00:15:50 because I'm not sure...
00:15:51 The one where she said...
00:15:52 The one where she said,
00:15:53 Ben is an incorrigible asshole,
00:15:55 and I won't be on the PCP anymore.
00:15:56 That one.
00:15:57 Oh, that one.
00:15:58 Well...
00:16:01 Yeah.
00:16:02 I mean, it's just a podcast.
00:16:04 So, like, whatever.
00:16:06 It's a problem with Ben's saying as far as it seems to be the case.
00:16:11 As long as Ben's saying is here,
00:16:13 Trixie will not want to be here.
00:16:15 And it's like,
00:16:16 well, yeah, I can see not wanting to, like,
00:16:18 clash heads if you don't need to.
00:16:20 But she hasn't been on the podcast in a while anyway.
00:16:22 Yeah.
00:16:23 So, I feel like this is more like,
00:16:25 oh, no, she's leaving the PCP.
00:16:28 Like, it feels like it's...
00:16:30 In the minds of many people witnessing it
00:16:33 is more of a big deal than it actually is.
00:16:36 It's just Ben and Trixie have fallen out.
00:16:40 Like, things have happened like this before.
00:16:42 I don't know whether it will come back to how it was before.
00:16:45 Like, I don't think this is like,
00:16:46 oh, the irreparable bridge-burning, the end.
00:16:49 Like, years from now, for 40 years,
00:16:52 they'll be still, like, throwing spears through each other's windows.
00:16:55 Like, it is not...
00:16:57 I don't know.
00:16:58 It doesn't feel like that big of a deal.
00:17:00 It just sort of, like, Ben annoys Trixie so much
00:17:02 he doesn't want to be on a podcast.
00:17:04 It's not really that big of a deal.
00:17:09 I don't know. I don't know.
00:17:11 I don't think I agree.
00:17:13 I think she's gone forever
00:17:17 off to be weird with her creepy, shady roommates.
00:17:21 And those are her new friends.
00:17:24 And that's the direction she's taken.
00:17:26 I don't know, they're totally creepy, shady.
00:17:28 Riley is a bit of a...
00:17:30 They're creepy, they're creepy, they're creepy, shady.
00:17:34 Riley is, like, eccentric.
00:17:36 I don't know whether creepy is the word I would use.
00:17:38 And I don't really know much about men salad and bird.
00:17:41 They seem like more chill than Riley.
00:17:43 Riley's, like, the big, crazy boy.
00:17:46 This was the thing.
00:17:49 The tweet made it sound like it was, like,
00:17:52 we were arguing about the...
00:17:55 the lecture, which we weren't.
00:17:59 She got mad and left because I was angry
00:18:02 that Riley was talking about planning his own Radcon
00:18:07 for us.
00:18:09 And I was angry and I insulted him to her
00:18:12 and denounced him in the strongest possible terms.
00:18:14 And that was what was too much for her.
00:18:17 And made her say, no, I'm leaving.
00:18:20 Ben's a mean asshole and won't be on a podcast.
00:18:23 Because he said mean things about my
00:18:26 quote-unquote producer, Lamal.
00:18:31 And I just think that's weird.
00:18:33 I'll just say this.
00:18:35 I've been to BronyCon and I enjoyed the experience.
00:18:38 I don't think me meeting Riley would be that bad.
00:18:41 I don't find that to be, like, terror.
00:18:43 I don't find him creepier or anything.
00:18:45 He seems like a wacky, crazy guy.
00:18:47 Creepy is not the right word.
00:18:49 I don't think he seems like an asshole.
00:18:51 Well, maybe.
00:18:53 But, like, he also seems like a nice person
00:18:55 to the people he cares about.
00:18:57 That's the impression I've been given.
00:18:59 I don't agree with that.
00:19:02 Yeah, well, whatever.
00:19:07 He seems tribal.
00:19:09 They all seem tribal.
00:19:11 Like, they're the in-group and everyone else is the enemy.
00:19:14 So in that way, yeah.
00:19:16 I guess I would say nice to his friends.
00:19:20 Against everyone else is the sense I get from them.
00:19:26 But I would not stay in a positive way.
00:19:30 But I see what you're saying.
00:19:32 I see where you're coming from.
00:19:34 I feel like...
00:19:36 They're not like the devil.
00:19:38 And I could see myself...
00:19:40 I'm not saying they're like the devil.
00:19:42 Reaching out to them personally.
00:19:44 That was bad of me.
00:19:46 But, like, you clearly have no...
00:19:48 Like, you have no intentions of ever, like, making peace with them.
00:19:51 I don't like them.
00:19:53 I don't like them.
00:19:55 That was fine.
00:19:57 It's fine that I don't like them.
00:19:59 It's not a problem.
00:20:01 It only became a problem when one of them
00:20:04 tried to stick their fucking nose into my business
00:20:07 with the rad con stuff.
00:20:09 And Trixie, and I said, Trixie, this is...
00:20:12 I hate this.
00:20:14 And she was like...
00:20:16 Why don't you respect my friends?
00:20:18 Well, because they're fucking annoying
00:20:20 and they are...
00:20:22 They don't understand boundaries.
00:20:24 And keep them away from me.
00:20:27 That's it.
00:20:29 That's how I feel.
00:20:31 And Ben St. did nothing wrong.
00:20:34 Hashtag free Ben St.
00:20:36 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:20:38 It's like, from my perspective,
00:20:40 I can see both sides of it.
00:20:42 Like, yeah, they...
00:20:44 Kind of...
00:20:46 It is kind of weird and annoying that they're like...
00:20:48 Rad con.
00:20:50 Wait!
00:20:52 We should just throw our own rad con.
00:20:54 We can have it at, like, our concert.
00:20:56 Like, okay, we'll just do that.
00:20:59 Like, no.
00:21:00 Like, fuck you.
00:21:02 What the fuck gives you...
00:21:04 What right do you think you have?
00:21:06 What do you think you have a say in any of this?
00:21:08 Of course you don't.
00:21:09 Shut the fuck up.
00:21:11 But I also see
00:21:13 their perspective a little bit.
00:21:16 I don't know.
00:21:17 I'm more willing...
00:21:19 I don't think that you're in the wrong.
00:21:21 I hate you for agreeing with them at all.
00:21:23 Cool.
00:21:25 I don't want to, like,
00:21:27 side with them or anything.
00:21:29 But I just... I feel like this is...
00:21:31 There's gonna be a lot of, like,
00:21:33 bitterness built up
00:21:35 based on the idea that this is so
00:21:37 massive an event.
00:21:39 And I'm like...
00:21:41 We're all just people.
00:21:43 It's not really that, like,
00:21:45 devastating.
00:21:47 Nothing's really been done...
00:21:49 I mean, at the end of the day,
00:21:51 it is just a podcast
00:21:53 and nothing...
00:21:55 And nothing else is affected by it.
00:21:57 I mean, sure.
00:21:59 I understand that.
00:22:03 Sure, yes.
00:22:05 You know, in a cosmic sense, I mean,
00:22:07 we're all just tiny specks
00:22:09 on a little blue ball
00:22:11 orbiting a star, one of just
00:22:13 billions in the Milky Way galaxy.
00:22:15 What does anything really matter
00:22:17 in the grand scheme of it all?
00:22:19 I know, I know.
00:22:21 I know.
00:22:23 I just feel like
00:22:25 an urge to...
00:22:27 I don't know.
00:22:29 Like, calm everyone down, because it's like,
00:22:31 people are getting really upset.
00:22:33 So, like, all over the place.
00:22:35 I'm like...
00:22:37 I don't know what can...
00:22:39 Like, this isn't...
00:22:41 I'm not that concerned,
00:22:43 honestly.
00:22:45 I'm also not concerned.
00:22:47 People get the impression
00:22:49 that you are raging at them.
00:22:51 Like, you are absolutely like...
00:22:53 Like, I want them dead.
00:22:55 Well, sometimes I do get mad at people.
00:22:57 I got mad
00:22:59 at those Radcon comments,
00:23:01 made me very mad.
00:23:03 Some of the people on Twitter
00:23:05 responding to me about it made me very mad.
00:23:07 Uh...
00:23:09 What of it?
00:23:11 I think the thing with you, Ben,
00:23:13 is that, like, in text or on Twitter,
00:23:15 madness comes across as more,
00:23:17 like, devastating and
00:23:19 diabolical than you do when you are
00:23:21 a human being, and I can hear you,
00:23:23 and you're just Ben.
00:23:25 You're just Ben.
00:23:27 You couldn't hurt a fly, even if you had,
00:23:29 like, a two-handed sword.
00:23:31 I could. I think I could.
00:23:33 You gotta find two fucking
00:23:35 chainsaws and get your casting
00:23:37 delayed down.
00:23:39 If I had a big wand, with a lot of capacity
00:23:41 and a high and a low
00:23:43 refresh rate, I could
00:23:45 kill many flies
00:23:47 with bullets.
00:23:49 Uh, I know what you mean.
00:23:51 This whole thing has been very
00:23:53 weird for me as someone who is not
00:23:55 prone to conflict
00:23:57 and tries to just, like, smooth things over.
00:23:59 Watching this all explode, like,
00:24:01 back to back, and I'm just like,
00:24:03 okay, um, I don't even...
00:24:05 I'd even had the time
00:24:07 to formulate an opinion
00:24:09 on Riley and Co.
00:24:11 I knew nothing about them, and then
00:24:13 all of a sudden, there was a fight,
00:24:15 and I was like, ah, interesting.
00:24:17 Okay, I have no
00:24:19 greater context for this.
00:24:21 And it was weird.
00:24:23 I mean, I mean, what more
00:24:25 context?
00:24:27 What more context do we need?
00:24:29 I don't know. My context was a couple tweets
00:24:31 and a cringe drama
00:24:33 video, and that was all the context I had,
00:24:35 and I feel like...
00:24:37 Wait, what cringe drama video?
00:24:39 The big fight thing.
00:24:41 The Ethan Ralph thing.
00:24:43 That was not really related,
00:24:45 but it was like, direct information.
00:24:47 No, I'm just saying, like,
00:24:49 it's like, how did I realize who half these people were?
00:24:51 It was through that video, so I'm like,
00:24:53 I'm not gonna judge anybody from that video.
00:24:55 That's like, the worst
00:24:57 the worst moment of all of their lives
00:24:59 in the last couple months, probably.
00:25:01 Yeah, which they
00:25:03 decided
00:25:05 it would be a great idea to upload.
00:25:07 It's pretty cringe. I will give you that.
00:25:09 Right? Okay.
00:25:11 I agree.
00:25:13 So, I mean, I think we can draw
00:25:15 some conclusions.
00:25:17 I mean, Trixie's known for posting cringe
00:25:19 before. This is different.
00:25:21 This is different cringe.
00:25:23 I guess it is a little different. It's very personal.
00:25:25 I was very surprised when I saw it.
00:25:27 Yeah.
00:25:29 I mean, I have... It is the thing,
00:25:31 like, traditionally, you would be like, oh,
00:25:33 God, let's not talk about this.
00:25:35 I hope it doesn't blow up. I'm surprised.
00:25:37 But then to be the first, like,
00:25:39 journalist on the scene.
00:25:41 The first journalist. I'm surprised
00:25:43 you guys are on a different wavelength
00:25:45 about this. You guys are all
00:25:47 you guys are pretty well
00:25:49 just like, eh, that's
00:25:51 whatever. Who knows
00:25:53 what means anything.
00:25:55 I have many opinions
00:25:57 about what's going on and I hate
00:25:59 all of it. I hate everything
00:26:01 that's happening over there.
00:26:03 I
00:26:05 hate that video.
00:26:07 I hate Yig Studios.
00:26:09 I hate everyone.
00:26:11 Hmm.
00:26:13 That's it.
00:26:15 I think my thing is more
00:26:17 the way I respond to things
00:26:19 is like, well, what
00:26:21 is the purpose? What
00:26:23 ends am I hoping to achieve
00:26:25 with the way I respond to anything?
00:26:27 Like, I don't know. If I tell
00:26:29 them that I hate them,
00:26:31 even if it's true. I didn't tell anyone.
00:26:33 I didn't actually tell anyone. That's new.
00:26:35 This is a new revelation.
00:26:37 Okay. I didn't tell, but okay.
00:26:39 Yeah, I know what you mean. Alright, go on.
00:26:41 I have, like, opinions
00:26:43 on the way that was handled and what it was.
00:26:45 I found it generally to be kind of funny,
00:26:47 but like cringe and like
00:26:49 why.
00:26:51 But, like,
00:26:53 I feel like if I wanted
00:26:55 to change something, I wouldn't, like,
00:26:57 I don't know.
00:26:59 But my opinion on it is
00:27:01 like saying it on Twitter
00:27:03 or saying that, like,
00:27:05 in a podcast, it makes
00:27:07 no difference, really.
00:27:09 If I really wanted to change something, I would try and talk to them directly.
00:27:11 Well, that's what I did. That's what I did.
00:27:13 I talked, I talked.
00:27:15 I'm not criticizing you. I'm just talking about how I handled this stuff.
00:27:17 I started by talking to Trixie in the PCP chat
00:27:19 and it led to the fight
00:27:21 and then she quit because she was mad.
00:27:23 That's what I did.
00:27:25 So I don't, what are you saying?
00:27:29 I guess
00:27:31 what I'm saying is, like,
00:27:33 I wouldn't have wanted Trixie to quit.
00:27:35 I would have wanted her to, like,
00:27:37 whatever problems I have,
00:27:39 I would have wanted them to go away
00:27:41 rather than for her to leave with them.
00:27:43 You know what I mean? Well, they weren't going to go away.
00:27:45 This isn't like a criticism of how you did anything.
00:27:47 I just want everyone to be friends.
00:27:49 We just want to go back.
00:27:51 We got to go back.
00:27:53 They weren't going to go away
00:27:55 because the Yig people
00:27:57 were completely overstepping
00:27:59 boundaries of good taste
00:28:01 and
00:28:03 society
00:28:05 and propriety
00:28:07 and it wasn't okay
00:28:09 but Trixie cares more about them
00:28:11 than she does about us
00:28:13 so she was not willing to
00:28:15 hear it
00:28:17 and so she left because she
00:28:19 can't deal with it
00:28:21 and that's a problem
00:28:23 and it wasn't going to go away
00:28:25 and I'm glad I brought it up
00:28:27 and if she needs to leave
00:28:29 over that then so be it
00:28:31 that's what she should do.
00:28:33 I got a PBRB.
00:28:35 Oh, god damn it.
00:28:37 Oh, no.
00:28:39 Now it's just me and Ben
00:28:41 and that awkward statement
00:28:43 and I don't know how to follow it up with anything
00:28:45 relevant or meaningful.
00:28:47 You guys are making it awkward
00:28:49 by not just agreeing with me.
00:28:51 If we were agreeing with you
00:28:53 this would be much more entertaining, I agree.
00:28:55 If we had like a 20 minute dunk session
00:28:57 that would have been much more entertaining.
00:28:59 I don't need a 20 minute dunk session.
00:29:01 I just need everyone to agree.
00:29:03 You two
00:29:05 you're so like, oh conciliatory.
00:29:07 Oh, can we all be friends?
00:29:09 That's true.
00:29:11 To my detriment I am conciliatory.
00:29:13 I will admit that outright.
00:29:15 I understand that but to my eye
00:29:17 there are irreconcilable differences here
00:29:19 that do not permit such a solution.
00:29:23 That being the case
00:29:25 I don't see
00:29:27 what has
00:29:29 I don't see this as like a bad
00:29:31 way, is like a bad
00:29:33 resolution. It seems to me like this is the only
00:29:35 thing that could have happened.
00:29:37 Well, I would agree. I think this probably was the only
00:29:39 way considering all the pieces that were on the board
00:29:41 this was going to go.
00:29:43 I think it's like
00:29:45 my general reaction to these things
00:29:47 is to like set back, assess, try to figure out
00:29:49 everything that's going on and I don't know enough about
00:29:51 these other people, the you guys
00:29:53 to make a
00:29:55 informed decision and so
00:29:57 my general stance is to
00:29:59 just do nothing. I was like, well I don't know what's going on.
00:30:01 Well I was totally willing, I was totally willing
00:30:03 to ignore them until they started
00:30:05 stepping on our fucking feet
00:30:07 and talking about going
00:30:09 over our heads and doing some shit that
00:30:11 they don't have any fucking business doing.
00:30:13 That's what did it for me.
00:30:15 It
00:30:17 I wouldn't, I was not going to
00:30:19 say anything
00:30:21 until then. I don't know.
00:30:23 I feel like
00:30:25 I've said all I can really say
00:30:27 about it.
00:30:29 I think
00:30:31 from my perspective
00:30:33 with regards to like RADCOM
00:30:35 organizing, it's always been sort of
00:30:37 out of my hands anyway because I live
00:30:39 so far away and it's sort of like
00:30:41 I don't know, I don't feel
00:30:43 as connected to like organizations
00:30:45 of those things
00:30:47 so like if it just happened to be like hey
00:30:49 if Riley said
00:30:51 hey we're doing like a
00:30:53 RADCOM like brony lecture redo
00:30:55 and we're going to pay for your flight, I'll be like yeah okay
00:30:57 like I wouldn't have too much of a problem
00:30:59 with them organizing that
00:31:01 I'd just fly over and just
00:31:03 exist for a while like I do
00:31:05 whenever I come over and
00:31:07 make some content
00:31:09 or content, I guess content's destroyed now
00:31:11 lol
00:31:13 Oh yeah, that also happens
00:31:15 but like
00:31:17 I feel like
00:31:19 you don't understand
00:31:21 I don't have as much of a problem
00:31:23 you don't understand
00:31:25 it's more than that
00:31:27 because it wasn't just like hey I'll fly
00:31:29 everyone out
00:31:31 first of all, I don't believe he was actually
00:31:33 going to pay, I think he was lying
00:31:35 but whatever
00:31:37 setting that aside
00:31:39 it wasn't like oh I'll fly everyone out
00:31:41 so they can re-record this lecture
00:31:43 okay, we'll have RADCOM
00:31:45 we'll have it
00:31:47 at my concert
00:31:49 like me and Trixie will put on a concert
00:31:51 and we'll just make RADCOM like a sideshow act
00:31:53 to that, we'll just subsume it into our thing
00:31:57 and host it there
00:31:59 yeah, I mean obviously from
00:32:01 and I just find it despicable
00:32:03 from the perspective of fans of RADCOM
00:32:05 that would not be what they want
00:32:07 the absolute gall of it all
00:32:09 the energy would definitely be different
00:32:11 I was just thinking
00:32:13 myself, I'd be okay with whatever
00:32:15 happens, but like
00:32:17 if people want a RADCOM 5
00:32:19 or 4.5
00:32:21 whatever it was going to be
00:32:23 a Trixie and Riley
00:32:25 music concert obviously
00:32:27 is not what people know or care about
00:32:29 in the audience that we have
00:32:31 so it would be like
00:32:33 of course not
00:32:35 absolutely not
00:32:37 never, never, never, never
00:32:39 I don't know
00:32:41 I guess I'm just too open minded
00:32:43 I'm just like yeah, why not
00:32:45 I would be willing to do that
00:32:47 I would be willing to go there
00:32:49 this is horrible
00:32:51 it's despicable
00:32:53 I'm just over here with my
00:32:55 wooden planks and rope
00:32:57 and I'm building bridges every day
00:32:59 look at what has happened
00:33:01 look at the state
00:33:03 of the YIG Studio channel
00:33:05 which is being run
00:33:07 by these people
00:33:09 I don't want them in charge of anything that I do
00:33:11 no thank you
00:33:13 I agree, I'm not really down with
00:33:15 their aesthetic or what they're doing
00:33:17 their content doesn't interest me
00:33:19 and I don't say that maliciously just as
00:33:21 merely a matter of taste
00:33:23 I guess
00:33:25 I don't know, the thing is
00:33:27 we're talking about this whole
00:33:29 what Riley wanted to do
00:33:31 but like
00:33:33 none of us ever had a conversation
00:33:35 passively
00:33:37 we're saying like Ben
00:33:39 Riley never approached you despite the fact that
00:33:41 publicly had been stated a few times that you had been approached
00:33:43 I don't think it really happened
00:33:45 that's what you were saying
00:33:47 it was never
00:33:49 I guess
00:33:51 the only thing that I'm confused about
00:33:53 is it just
00:33:55 it sounds like we're extrapolating some things
00:33:57 from this hearsay
00:33:59 I don't know what's true and what's not
00:34:01 people saw Riley saying stuff
00:34:03 and then they showed it to me in my discord
00:34:05 and I
00:34:07 said in the pcp chat
00:34:09 that I didn't like it
00:34:11 and Trixie communicated that
00:34:13 I didn't like what I was seeing
00:34:15 to Riley
00:34:17 and Riley took that as a
00:34:19 oh, Ben has refused my offer
00:34:21 of hosting a radcon
00:34:23 Ben
00:34:25 Ben just doesn't want there to be another radcon
00:34:27 I guess
00:34:29 that's the really
00:34:31 you know what, it's not the really
00:34:33 galling thing because there are many
00:34:35 truly galling aspects of the whole thing
00:34:37 but one particularly galling aspect
00:34:39 was the way that it was cast
00:34:41 the fact that I don't like
00:34:43 that these people
00:34:45 are planning radcon
00:34:47 for us without asking us about it
00:34:49 without even consulting us
00:34:51 as though they have any right to do that
00:34:53 is that like oh, well
00:34:55 I guess if Ben says he doesn't like the plan
00:34:57 then Ben is just anti-radcon
00:34:59 he is the one that is like holding it up
00:35:01 and preventing it
00:35:03 as though it's this or nothing
00:35:05 as though it's either like these strangers
00:35:07 these fucking strangers because that's what they are
00:35:09 these complete strangers can't plan
00:35:11 this thing then I guess
00:35:13 Ben just never wants it to happen, he must be against it
00:35:15 oh, he must just hate it
00:35:17 I mean, I don't think
00:35:19 anybody would deny that like
00:35:21 it feels like a lot of the moves
00:35:23 and things that are said seem to be
00:35:25 I don't know
00:35:27 I don't want to say manipulative
00:35:29 I will say manipulative
00:35:31 to gain sympathy
00:35:33 because as soon as this
00:35:35 happened you were kind of reframed as the enemy
00:35:37 which I don't think was the point
00:35:39 I guess I'm just
00:35:41 I don't know
00:35:43 it's strange because we never had a conversation about this
00:35:45 I feel like a conversation probably would have cleared a lot of this up
00:35:47 if it was going to be like
00:35:49 hey
00:35:51 we want to redo the Brony lecture
00:35:53 and we're going to be touring and doing concerts or whatever
00:35:55 and if we can all meet up here
00:35:57 and I'll pay for you
00:35:59 we're just doing this anyway but you can just
00:36:01 go do the thing by yourselves
00:36:03 and we just happen to be in the area
00:36:05 that would have been one thing
00:36:07 that would have been one thing
00:36:09 but if it was like oh, I'm going to produce
00:36:11 an entire new Radcon event
00:36:13 and now I'm in charge of it
00:36:15 that's where I'd be like
00:36:17 eh, I'm not too keen on that
00:36:19 because I don't want to like
00:36:21 tightly integrate these people that I don't know
00:36:23 into the production
00:36:25 my only thing is
00:36:27 I don't know which idea
00:36:29 was actually the one being proposed because like we said
00:36:31 none of us ever actually had
00:36:33 a conversation about this
00:36:35 because it was the former
00:36:37 I read the comments
00:36:39 I read what was said and it was the second one
00:36:41 that's why I was mad
00:36:43 okay, alright
00:36:45 I have no way
00:36:47 of knowing for sure
00:36:49 I posted the
00:36:51 screenshots, someone showed me the screenshots
00:36:53 and I reposted them and you can read them
00:36:55 and that's what they say
00:36:57 okay
00:36:59 okay
00:37:01 I just don't
00:37:03 like it
00:37:05 I just don't like it
00:37:07 I'm not a fan of the situation myself
00:37:09 I think
00:37:11 I think it's all a bit like
00:37:15 it's all pretty cringe
00:37:17 it's not much, I don't know
00:37:19 oh I guess I should go to
00:37:21 Trixie about what I think but I don't know what I think
00:37:23 should I just say
00:37:25 well
00:37:27 I don't know
00:37:29 what am I supposed to DM her about
00:37:31 like
00:37:33 it just sort of feels like
00:37:35 there's nothing
00:37:37 I can do about it
00:37:39 I don't like being wrapped up in this
00:37:41 but whatever
00:37:43 nothing can be done
00:37:45 let's just
00:37:47 blow it all up
00:37:53 okay, let's do it
00:37:55 alright, kaboom
00:37:57 it's all dead, it's all gone
00:37:59 are we voicemails?
00:38:01 we could have Wreck on
00:38:03 but we can't call it Wreck
00:38:05 well I guess we can
00:38:07 it's like
00:38:09 it's a bastardization of Trixie's dead name
00:38:11 so it's kind of weird
00:38:13 there's nothing we can do
00:38:15 we gotta go into the graveyard
00:38:17 and we gotta get
00:38:19 our lightning rod
00:38:21 and we gotta dig up Brad Garlinghouse's corpse
00:38:23 we gotta revive him
00:38:25 we have to have BradCon too
00:38:27 it's the only option
00:38:29 honestly, BradCon
00:38:33 I'm ready, I'm ready for BradCon
00:38:35 look, we all gave Brad
00:38:37 a ton of shit for XRP
00:38:39 but now we're all into crypto
00:38:41 a lot, he's the leader we need
00:38:43 let's see how Ripple's doing
00:38:45 I was kind of annoyed
00:38:47 I was kind of like
00:38:49 annoyed that my
00:38:51 brother
00:38:53 he had gotten into crypto
00:38:55 through other means
00:38:57 not through anything I had heard about
00:38:59 and he had gotten some Ripple
00:39:01 and he made some money off of it and he told me
00:39:03 and I was like, oh cool I guess
00:39:05 because he didn't know about the whole XRP
00:39:07 Brad Garlinghouse stuff
00:39:09 that ruined the PCP
00:39:11 he doesn't know the context
00:39:13 so I was like, I felt mad about it
00:39:15 but obviously he didn't know
00:39:17 it was just sort of like
00:39:19 you were mad
00:39:21 because he was into XRP
00:39:23 and he didn't know that
00:39:25 I wasn't mad at him
00:39:27 it was just a little reaction I had
00:39:29 like, oh fuck no
00:39:31 you've betrayed me
00:39:33 well I guess you couldn't have known
00:39:35 that's funny, that's pretty funny actually
00:39:37 I just saw this live stream
00:39:39 on this random YouTube channel
00:39:41 and I got into it
00:39:43 Ripple is
00:39:45 it's up from
00:39:47 it's up from
00:39:49 where it was like last year
00:39:51 but it's like
00:39:53 not that high
00:39:55 so it's neutral I guess
00:39:59 that's how Ripple's doing in case
00:40:01 in 2020 we destroyed XRP
00:40:03 in 2022 we need to max revive it
00:40:05 here's its entire
00:40:07 here's its entire life story
00:40:09 in graph form
00:40:11 it went up and down and down and up and down
00:40:13 it went down and then it went up again
00:40:15 yep
00:40:17 looks like stockmarket.png
00:40:19 to me
00:40:21 doing great Brad
00:40:23 it's trading at 6 cents
00:40:25 a bit
00:40:27 oh my god it's almost worth the same as Dogecoin
00:40:29 dude bits
00:40:31 you remember my little pony
00:40:33 do you remember when they had
00:40:35 bits
00:40:37 I thought you meant on Twitch
00:40:39 no no no no
00:40:41 Twitch copied my little pony back when it was called
00:40:43 JustinTV
00:40:45 and that's where all the new episodes were live streamed
00:40:47 I remember what you know
00:40:49 yeah do you remember
00:40:51 that was like the parent side of Twitch
00:40:53 and Twitch was like a subsidiary gaming branch
00:40:55 and then Twitch just took over because it got so big
00:40:57 I've never heard of JustinTV
00:40:59 back in the old days
00:41:01 there was a little pony like
00:41:03 oh this is a new episode coming out
00:41:05 and there was like 7 different streaming services
00:41:07 that would stream the episode from Hasbro
00:41:09 TV
00:41:11 and all these nerds would come
00:41:13 and watch on JustinTV
00:41:15 the ponies
00:41:17 that's what's gonna heal us
00:41:19 we're all gonna get into gen 5
00:41:21 it's gonna be good and we're all gonna be healed
00:41:23 isn't already out? isn't already going?
00:41:25 no the movie's coming out soon
00:41:27 I think
00:41:29 there's 3D
00:41:31 yeah we talked about this
00:41:33 and now it looks like
00:41:35 any fucking
00:41:37 DreamWorks movie
00:41:39 I don't know if the show's gonna be
00:41:41 animated in the same style
00:41:43 so it's a walloff
00:41:47 I bet it'll be
00:41:49 I bet it'll be 3D
00:41:51 it is 3D
00:41:53 oh the show yeah maybe
00:41:55 yeah yeah
00:41:57 what's the name?
00:41:59 well that's something to be excited about
00:42:01 I guess that's something
00:42:03 that's coming in the future
00:42:05 get hype
00:42:07 uh
00:42:09 we still on board to do
00:42:11 a pony movie review episode
00:42:13 I'm down
00:42:15 pony movie review bonus episode
00:42:17 hell yeah
00:42:19 hell fucking yeah
00:42:21 I'm not gonna go see it in theaters though
00:42:23 we're gonna be old people
00:42:25 we're gonna be
00:42:27 I can't even imagine going to a movie theater anymore
00:42:29 the kids these days they're like in the 3D
00:42:31 ponies and that's stupid
00:42:33 back in my day we had
00:42:35 back in the day we had flash puppets
00:42:37 flash puppets
00:42:41 and they made the funny meme
00:42:43 faces in season 4
00:42:45 do you remember the memes
00:42:49 do you remember when they gave the purple one wings
00:42:51 and everybody bitched for months
00:42:53 remember when the pink one made the funny face
00:42:57 you know what they're not gonna be able to have a derpy in 3D
00:42:59 you're not gonna be able to have an animation error like that
00:43:01 oh are they gonna do you think they're gonna try
00:43:03 to do any of that like
00:43:05 like recreate the brony fandom
00:43:07 like beat for beat
00:43:09 it'd be pretty cringe if they did
00:43:11 have like oh here's
00:43:13 a accidental glitch
00:43:15 pony and what are you
00:43:17 what do you fans want to call that
00:43:19 and then like they tweet about it and
00:43:21 don't even summon that kind of energy
00:43:23 into the physical plane
00:43:25 well the thing is if they do do that
00:43:27 it'll come like corporate
00:43:29 feeling and then nobody would get into it at all
00:43:31 yeah exactly
00:43:33 it has to all be organic
00:43:35 I mean companies don't understand that
00:43:37 I'm sure they're already working like alright how are we gonna
00:43:39 how are we gonna get the brony bucks
00:43:41 we gotta figure out how to plant these little seeds
00:43:43 and it'll suck but
00:43:45 I hope not
00:43:47 it's kind of doomed from the start
00:43:49 because the brony thing only came about
00:43:51 because nobody was expecting
00:43:53 a pony show to be
00:43:55 good in any way
00:43:57 it was a surprise that's what
00:43:59 that was the gimmick at the beginning
00:44:01 gen 5 is just like oh yeah
00:44:03 I wonder if they'll do that gimmick again
00:44:05 I wonder if they'll just do it again
00:44:07 I wonder if it'll still be good
00:44:09 very unlikely
00:44:11 I don't know if it's evolved creatively with us
00:44:13 it has pros and cons and it's like
00:44:15 there's better cartoons out there
00:44:17 I don't know who's involved in the studio
00:44:19 like making this show
00:44:21 because I'm obviously Lauren Faust isn't involved
00:44:23 I don't know if like
00:44:25 Megan McArthur or the fuck her name was
00:44:27 if she's still helming the ship with this new series
00:44:29 or it's somebody else
00:44:31 who knows
00:44:33 but that'll probably affect whether it's good or not
00:44:35 it's a different animation studio of course
00:44:37 yeah
00:44:39 whatever
00:44:41 who cares there's nothing to talk about
00:44:43 whatever
00:44:45 the show wasn't even that good
00:44:47 what?
00:44:49 it wasn't even that good it was just fine
00:44:51 no you don't understand
00:44:53 there was a rainbow pony in it
00:44:55 you don't understand
00:44:57 it's true
00:44:59 no I do understand all that
00:45:01 that show was like 20% cooler
00:45:03 than other shows
00:45:05 do you remember when applejack wore those
00:45:07 thigh high horse shoes
00:45:09 that was strange
00:45:11 galoshes
00:45:13 no
00:45:15 no
00:45:17 no
00:45:19 god no
00:45:21 fuck
00:45:23 shut up
00:45:25 okay
00:45:27 no more
00:45:29 pony talk at the dinner table
00:45:31 eat your slop
00:45:33 hey you hear that
00:45:35 about buffy the vampire slayer
00:45:37 what
00:45:39 let's go on
00:45:41 I've been watching
00:45:43 your old buffy the vampire slayer
00:45:45 and it's been very nice
00:45:47 I'm on season 5 now
00:45:49 because it's base
00:45:51 why would you do that
00:45:53 why wouldn't you just play noida
00:45:55 it's like if noida was a tv show
00:45:57 and it was better than noida
00:45:59 you could have a chainsaw
00:46:01 you could shoot multiple bullets
00:46:03 per frame
00:46:05 60 bullets a second
00:46:07 getting a new episode of
00:46:09 the buffy the vampire slayer is just watching
00:46:11 bensank die right in front of me
00:46:13 that's why I like it
00:46:15 hmm
00:46:17 okay
00:46:19 solid
00:46:21 anyway
00:46:23 I want people in the audience
00:46:25 to get into buffy the vampire slayer
00:46:27 and then you will realize that
00:46:29 it's the coolest thing ever but it's hard to talk about
00:46:31 because there's so much continuity
00:46:33 that you don't want to ruin anything
00:46:35 people have been telling me to watch
00:46:37 buffy the vampire slayer since I was like 13
00:46:39 well you're late
00:46:41 no I was right
00:46:43 I've been right all along
00:46:45 nope
00:46:47 I can't
00:46:49 literally my entire personality
00:46:51 is that I haven't seen buffy the vampire slayer
00:46:53 and I can't go back
00:46:55 on that I'd give them everything
00:46:59 hmm
00:47:01 oh no
00:47:03 that's the weakness
00:47:05 it's a vampire but instead of sunlight
00:47:07 it's watching buffy the vampire slayer
00:47:09 that's correct
00:47:11 if a monitor appears
00:47:13 with buffy the vampire slayer on it
00:47:15 and the light of that monitor touches you
00:47:17 you burn and turn to dust
00:47:19 yeah
00:47:21 it would do heavy
00:47:23 a holy damage to me
00:47:25 that's correct
00:47:27 if I make a steak out of
00:47:29 melted down buffy the vampire slayer
00:47:31 DVDs
00:47:33 I think so
00:47:35 to be fair that would kill probably anybody
00:47:37 yeah
00:47:39 that would probably kill most people
00:47:43 I'm actually just more
00:47:45 vulnerable
00:47:47 than most people
00:47:49 I have all the vampire weaknesses
00:47:51 and none of its strengths
00:47:53 if you stab Ben with that he turned into a poor
00:47:55 90's CGI skeleton
00:47:57 and then collapsed the dust
00:47:59 like vampires do in buffy the vampire slayer
00:48:01 yes yes
00:48:03 Willow has funny jokes
00:48:05 and Xander also has funny jokes
00:48:07 and buffy is buffy
00:48:09 and there's Giles and he's British
00:48:11 Giles the British man
00:48:13 now we know why you like it
00:48:15 oh yes I got the library
00:48:17 turn it over
00:48:19 find out about the vampire's buffy
00:48:21 and buffy's like I don't want to do any of this stuff
00:48:23 he's like well you have to train buffy
00:48:25 you have to be a vampire slayer
00:48:27 oh I'm British
00:48:29 that's the whole show
00:48:31 well if it's got
00:48:33 I guess we just watched it then
00:48:35 then maybe I am interested
00:48:37 no no no I live for racist characters
00:48:39 of British people
00:48:41 British
00:48:43 if more people say British then the world will be more British
00:48:45 I'm British
00:48:47 I'm gonna drink a bottle of water
00:48:49 a bottle of water
00:48:51 a bottle of water
00:48:55 wear your tees
00:48:57 you fucks
00:48:59 we're drinking all of them
00:49:01 we don't have any left for speech
00:49:03 damn that was pretty good
00:49:05 alright I've been owned
00:49:07 alright I've been owned
00:49:13 so Kantan's dead
00:49:15 yep
00:49:17 it's on hiatus
00:49:19 it's not on hiatus
00:49:21 it's on hiatus
00:49:23 Trixie's been quote unquote fired
00:49:25 and reiterated that she let herself be fired
00:49:27 which I think
00:49:29 the word is quit
00:49:31 I think quit is the word
00:49:33 I believe that is the word
00:49:35 yeah that's how I would describe it
00:49:37 well
00:49:39 I mean she said that
00:49:41 it was Nate who didn't want to work with her
00:49:43 and Riley and all that
00:49:45 I don't understand
00:49:47 this is it
00:49:49 this is it again
00:49:51 what did the crew
00:49:53 in conjunction with
00:49:55 this Kantan
00:49:57 what did they have to do with it
00:49:59 it's suspicious
00:50:01 I don't know
00:50:03 it just speaks to a larger pattern that I'm seeing
00:50:05 here where these
00:50:07 individuals
00:50:09 are just being inserted
00:50:11 into places where they don't belong
00:50:13 it seems like it's a package deal
00:50:15 you know
00:50:17 and I hate that and if it's a package deal
00:50:19 I say no thanks to the whole package
00:50:21 so this is
00:50:23 more reinforcement of why I did the right thing
00:50:25 as I always do
00:50:27 yeah
00:50:29 I guess there's just not enough information
00:50:31 right now like I can understand
00:50:33 Trixie with
00:50:35 her new boyfriend
00:50:37 well no I can't
00:50:39 I can't understand that
00:50:41 that was unacceptable when it was May
00:50:43 and it's unacceptable when anyone does it at any time
00:50:45 sure
00:50:47 I guess I know but like
00:50:49 and now it's a business thing
00:50:51 Kantan is a business thing right
00:50:53 there's a show
00:50:55 you wouldn't
00:50:57 Trixie never brought May to
00:50:59 shows
00:51:01 well she tried her hardest to bring her to Radcon
00:51:03 that's true
00:51:05 the only reason May wasn't at the shows
00:51:07 is because we put our foot down about it
00:51:09 yeah
00:51:11 this is what I'm talking about
00:51:13 this is a pattern of behavior
00:51:15 just
00:51:17 I don't know what to think about it
00:51:19 exactly because I don't know anything about that situation
00:51:21 or who said what about it
00:51:23 could ask Nate but I don't know
00:51:25 whether he want to talk about all that
00:51:27 shit
00:51:29 I tried reaching out to Nate and he was very mama on the situation
00:51:31 he's just like I don't want to talk about it
00:51:33 and I was like alright fair enough
00:51:35 I mean it's obvious
00:51:37 I mean I guess I can only speculate
00:51:39 this is just my speculation but it's
00:51:41 seem really obvious
00:51:43 that it's the fact that she's moving
00:51:45 into an RV
00:51:47 and going to be roaming across the
00:51:49 country
00:51:51 that's the plan
00:51:53 but she frames it like oh it's Nate's fault
00:51:55 that Nate doesn't want to work
00:51:57 under those circumstances
00:51:59 when like
00:52:01 you're the one who's changing shit up
00:52:03 you're the one who's doing this
00:52:05 it's not that Nate doesn't want
00:52:07 to work with you anymore it's that you
00:52:09 made all
00:52:11 you have radically changed
00:52:13 the situation
00:52:15 yeah I mean
00:52:17 I would like to think
00:52:19 that there was some sort of discussion about this
00:52:21 before it was immediately implemented
00:52:23 but I have a feeling there probably wasn't
00:52:25 which is unfortunate
00:52:27 well I don't know
00:52:29 that's one thing I don't know
00:52:31 I'm talking about my ass because I don't know
00:52:33 anything about any of this other than the surface
00:52:35 image of it
00:52:37 I'm speculating but it seems obvious
00:52:39 and what Trixie said
00:52:41 on Twitter pretty much corroborates it
00:52:43 so I'm treating it as like
00:52:45 99% certain
00:52:47 it just seems like
00:52:49 everything
00:52:51 indicates that that is the issue
00:52:53 I'm curious about
00:52:55 the RV thing like the idea of getting into
00:52:57 an RV and traveling around like okay
00:52:59 whatever
00:53:01 being able to do cantant I can't
00:53:03 help but say it like that I like saying it like that
00:53:05 just fine being able to do
00:53:07 cantant
00:53:09 like in the RV
00:53:11 means like traveling back
00:53:13 to Virginia to do like a bunch of episodes
00:53:15 then going in the RV and traveling away again
00:53:17 I guess
00:53:19 like how else would it work
00:53:21 that seemed to be the plan
00:53:23 but then they were doing
00:53:25 like
00:53:27 like anime that came out
00:53:29 like seasonal anime
00:53:31 so it would need to be
00:53:33 prompt it would need to be like as soon as
00:53:35 the anime episodes are out
00:53:37 yeah that's right
00:53:39 so like how far could she reasonably go
00:53:41 in an RV and then come back to do things
00:53:43 and also watch the anime at the same time
00:53:45 I don't know it feels
00:53:47 like there's a lot of
00:53:49 how would that work
00:53:51 seems like kind of a problem
00:53:55 seems like it might throw a wrench
00:53:57 into things a little bit
00:54:03 I mean Victor has been on cantant
00:54:05 before and Victor's cool
00:54:07 so that might continue like that
00:54:09 well Trixie said
00:54:11 Trixie said that
00:54:13 like she assumed Victor
00:54:15 I think she just assumed Victor
00:54:17 I don't know I mean I'm not just going to take her word for it
00:54:19 Victor
00:54:21 and Vic and Hope have been like doing anime videos
00:54:23 still like Vicks on that
00:54:25 that stuff
00:54:27 I could see that
00:54:29 I hate anime
00:54:31 and like if I were Nate
00:54:33 I would put all this effort into
00:54:35 you know building up cantant into a thing
00:54:37 I wouldn't want to just abandon it
00:54:39 I would probably
00:54:41 want to keep it going in some capacity
00:54:43 even if my co-host were to leave
00:54:45 whether or not he feels the same way
00:54:47 or whether
00:54:49 that's a possibility I mean I don't know
00:54:51 maybe Vic wouldn't want to do that
00:54:53 that would be
00:54:55 I mean who knows
00:54:57 so I mean I guess
00:54:59 it just remains to be seen what the fate of that
00:55:01 is
00:55:03 I just I can't help but feel for Nate a little
00:55:05 because he moved to Virginia
00:55:07 for this show
00:55:09 I kind of agree
00:55:11 but on the other hand
00:55:13 I think that's what you get when you work with Trixie
00:55:15 this is just what she does
00:55:17 I mean back when it was like
00:55:19 PCPHQ
00:55:21 like way back like it didn't seem like
00:55:23 same shit
00:55:25 well maybe I don't know maybe I wasn't paying attention
00:55:27 so that's the same thing
00:55:29 I mean we all
00:55:31 well I think what it was
00:55:33 is like we
00:55:35 we'd all assumed
00:55:37 like all of us had assumed that once there was an established
00:55:39 location
00:55:41 it would become
00:55:43 more stable for everyone
00:55:45 and then we could like
00:55:47 that was the idea behind PCPHQ from the beginning
00:55:49 was like
00:55:51 we get
00:55:53 creators together close proximity
00:55:55 to the studio be able to record things
00:55:57 with each other whenever we feel like
00:55:59 obviously quite difficult
00:56:01 especially now
00:56:03 because we're all doing different types of things
00:56:05 and like getting together for content is like
00:56:07 not as much of a draw
00:56:09 as it used to be
00:56:11 but like
00:56:13 for like I'm pretty sure
00:56:15 like even though Trixie hasn't been known to like
00:56:17 change ideas for things
00:56:19 I would have thought
00:56:21 and I would have assumed that because Nate was there
00:56:23 it would have been more stable
00:56:25 more consistent more
00:56:27 like that's a permanent
00:56:29 fixture on the whole
00:56:31 on the map and
00:56:33 if Trixie wants to do something different
00:56:35 she can do something different but also
00:56:37 still appear on canteen and it'll be fine
00:56:39 but I guess
00:56:41 none of them are so
00:56:43 I don't know
00:56:45 I don't know what
00:56:47 I'm not sure what point you're
00:56:49 getting at
00:56:51 there's no point to anything
00:56:53 it's all stupid
00:56:55 we're all just specks of dust
00:56:57 we're just orbiting in the space
00:56:59 it's a galaxy
00:57:01 trillions and billions
00:57:03 billions
00:57:05 we're all little stars that blink
00:57:07 in a galaxy
00:57:09 I just find it to be
00:57:11 unfortunate and I don't like it
00:57:13 I liked
00:57:15 content for them
00:57:17 I thought that was cool
00:57:19 finally getting some sort of
00:57:21 it's not unfortunate
00:57:23 it's choices
00:57:25 people have made choices
00:57:27 specifically Trixie has made choices
00:57:29 that have caused this outcome
00:57:31 those are mutually exclusive though
00:57:33 yeah
00:57:35 I mean unfortunate for
00:57:37 Nate who did not choose
00:57:39 whatever
00:57:41 you can say that this is obviously a result
00:57:43 of a logical conclusion to choices made
00:57:45 but it can still be unfortunate that those choices
00:57:47 were made in the first place
00:57:49 well I guess you're right
00:57:51 I guess you're right
00:57:53 excuse me
00:57:55 I apologize
00:57:57 dab
00:57:59 very well
00:58:01 I don't mind being the enlightened
00:58:03 centrist on this one
00:58:05 I don't care
00:58:07 so cringe
00:58:09 but
00:58:11 so be it
00:58:13 if you want to
00:58:15 just one more nail in your coffin
00:58:17 then go right ahead
00:58:19 if you want to put a nail
00:58:21 like half into the coffin
00:58:23 yeah
00:58:25 in the middle
00:58:27 I don't necessarily want to put the nail
00:58:29 all the way into the coffin
00:58:31 I can kind of see why you'd want to put the nail in the coffin
00:58:33 but I can kind of see why you wouldn't
00:58:35 so maybe I'll just kind of
00:58:37 tap the nail
00:58:39 so in case something bad happens
00:58:41 I can quickly nail the coffin
00:58:43 ironically how I feel about all this
00:58:45 because I feel so detached from it
00:58:47 I can't feel rage
00:58:49 one side of the other
00:58:51 it's not even just like
00:58:53 I feel furious
00:58:55 I'll just in case
00:58:57 maybe it's not coming through
00:58:59 maybe it doesn't come through when I speak in my voice as much
00:59:01 okay good I want it to come through
00:59:03 I'm afraid it's not coming through hard enough
00:59:05 well yeah honestly trust my tweets
00:59:07 my treats reflect my feelings more than
00:59:09 my voice does
00:59:13 you have a voice of an angel Ben
00:59:15 oh no
00:59:17 god shucks no go on though
00:59:21 I don't know
00:59:23 I'm very
00:59:25 I'm I
00:59:27 I guess
00:59:29 I don't need to belabor the point anymore
00:59:31 but I am mad
00:59:33 I there
00:59:35 I said it
00:59:37 I'm mad
00:59:39 it's out there guys there's no coming back
00:59:41 there's none
00:59:43 there's this um
00:59:45 this cat youtube video channel
00:59:47 I've been watching
00:59:49 where this cat has these buttons
00:59:51 and the buttons make noises
00:59:53 like words
00:59:55 and this person has been training the cat
00:59:57 to associate these words
00:59:59 with emotions and feelings and things
01:00:01 so the cat has learned
01:00:03 that when she's upset
01:00:05 with something she can click the mad button
01:00:07 and she just goes mad
01:00:09 mad mad
01:00:11 and her tail wags affirming
01:00:13 that she is mad about something
01:00:15 and I just thought that was funny
01:00:17 I'm just imagining Ben saying with this button
01:00:19 pressing it to let the world know
01:00:21 that he is mad now
01:00:23 that's me on twitter yeah
01:00:25 that's what twitter is for me
01:00:27 it's the mad button
01:00:31 I'm gonna find the video because it's really cute
01:00:33 fucking baste
01:00:35 link it so someone can superimpose Ben's face
01:00:37 mad mad mad
01:00:41 what a perfect
01:00:43 metaphor
01:00:45 for being mad
01:00:51 at least I cut this awkward sound
01:00:53 no we're gonna have to piece a party
01:00:55 podcast we can't do that
01:00:57 we are
01:00:59 and we can
01:01:01 but I thought last time we talked about this
01:01:03 we aren't and we don't
01:01:05 no we do we do
01:01:07 we must
01:01:09 something has changed in the two weeks I was not on the podcast
01:01:13 yeah we have crossover
01:01:15 cheesy is like a
01:01:17 he's like on the pizza party
01:01:19 podcast now
01:01:21 he's our man on the inside
01:01:23 that's what I was gonna say he's our man on the inside
01:01:25 he's our spy so we're gonna take it down from the inside
01:01:27 that's exactly right
01:01:29 or is cheesy trying to take down
01:01:31 us from the inside
01:01:33 I don't even want to
01:01:35 think about that possibility
01:01:37 the consequences of which would be
01:01:39 disastrous
01:01:41 if it's all cheesy's fault
01:01:43 he's done a lot of damage in the last two weeks
01:01:45 no I disagree
01:01:47 no I disagree
01:01:49 Riley is just a construct made by cheesy Manfredo
01:01:51 I unironically think
01:01:53 that everything that has happened is good
01:01:55 and I am happy about it
01:01:57 and I am not
01:01:59 sorry for anything
01:02:01 there's people
01:02:03 I feel like you guys have this attitude
01:02:05 and people on Twitter have this attitude that like
01:02:07 oh no I hope you can resolve
01:02:09 your differences I hope we can fix this and I legitimately
01:02:11 do not want to fix this
01:02:13 I do not want this to be undone
01:02:15 you consider this fixed
01:02:17 yes yes I consider this to be the solution
01:02:19 this is good
01:02:21 I like it
01:02:23 and it's frustrating
01:02:25 that I think I'm in the minority
01:02:27 about that
01:02:29 but I'm right
01:02:31 I don't like finality
01:02:33 in these sorts of things
01:02:35 I guess that's the only reason
01:02:37 I mean at the end of the day
01:02:39 Trixie not being on the podcast anymore
01:02:41 changes virtually nothing
01:02:43 you know like nothing's really
01:02:45 changed
01:02:47 the bigger issue I guess
01:02:49 I have is just that like it feels like
01:02:51 you know
01:02:53 they were our friend for so long
01:02:55 and now she's not and it's just like
01:02:57 I mean
01:02:59 well I mean think about what that says
01:03:01 think about what that says that like
01:03:03 friendship ended over this
01:03:05 that's my point I think it's really stupid
01:03:07 how much did it how much
01:03:09 how much did it actually mean
01:03:11 then well that's that's kind of like
01:03:13 the whole like reflection point like oh I
01:03:15 guess there wasn't much there to begin with and that's
01:03:17 really unfortunate there you go
01:03:19 so I feel the same way
01:03:21 bummer
01:03:23 man I watched Godzilla vs Kong
01:03:25 what a cool movie
01:03:27 it was so stupid it was the best
01:03:29 it was it was
01:03:31 it was a monkey and a lizard punching
01:03:33 it was all I could have ever wanted
01:03:35 I've heard I've heard mixed
01:03:37 I've heard seen some people saying it was base
01:03:39 and I've heard some people saying it was cringe
01:03:41 it was the dumbest movie I've seen in a long time
01:03:43 whether they were
01:03:45 gunning for the monkey or the
01:03:47 crocodile yeah who who wins
01:03:49 who wins Godzilla definitively
01:03:51 wins
01:03:53 so okay so
01:03:55 you were right
01:03:57 uh yeah I guess
01:03:59 I mean I'm sick
01:04:01 you you were saying on Twitter
01:04:03 you were arguing on Twitter that like
01:04:05 you know obviously Godzilla
01:04:07 is gonna has to win there's no way
01:04:09 you couldn't
01:04:11 but it was really cool it was cool the way
01:04:13 they did the fight like they made it like
01:04:15 like Godzilla is like a big tanky guy
01:04:17 who moves slow but Kong could like swing between
01:04:19 buildings and was like dodging all the hits and stuff
01:04:21 like as soon as he took a good hit from Godzilla he went down
01:04:23 I'm like yeah that's
01:04:25 if they were gonna fight that's probably how it would go down
01:04:27 you know it was it was pretty fucking cool
01:04:29 and there's lots there's lots of polygons moving
01:04:31 around there's lots of shading and lighting and like
01:04:33 good punching and buildings blew apart
01:04:35 uh every time a human was on
01:04:37 screen it was the cringiest thing of all time
01:04:39 but luckily like half
01:04:41 the movie like the main character of
01:04:43 the movie was King Kong and it was really
01:04:45 cool he like he like
01:04:47 new sign language and signed to a little
01:04:49 girl and it was smart
01:04:51 it was so fucking cool like this
01:04:53 little girl taught him they lived on an island with
01:04:55 it was the dumbest movie of all time
01:04:57 and I loved it
01:04:59 watch it it's great
01:05:01 okay turn two
01:05:03 I'm gonna be honest I
01:05:05 probably won't watch it but I
01:05:07 I don't expect you to maybe
01:05:09 someone in the audience will
01:05:11 take that advice
01:05:13 I was just watching the one letter of media
01:05:15 I had a half in the bag about it and it looks
01:05:17 like visually look pretty funny
01:05:19 it's fucking sick
01:05:21 pretty funny
01:05:23 it's the worst Mechagodzilla design though
01:05:25 definitely the worst Mechagodzilla design of all of them
01:05:27 where would this
01:05:29 rank in Godzilla films
01:05:31 would you say Mr. Godzilla
01:05:33 hmm
01:05:35 um I mean all the
01:05:37 legendary films have been kind of like
01:05:39 okay
01:05:41 but not great like
01:05:43 I don't think these are better than like the classic
01:05:45 Japanese monster movies
01:05:47 just because like it's weird
01:05:49 it's weird
01:05:51 because like Godzilla's supposed to be like this
01:05:53 like allegory for like you know like the
01:05:55 dangers of like nuclear weapons and stuff
01:05:57 and it's hard for
01:05:59 American audiences to empathize that
01:06:01 when they are the nukers and not the nukees
01:06:03 so like
01:06:05 they change Godzilla's allegory
01:06:07 in these legendary films from a
01:06:09 nuclear thing to
01:06:11 to an ecological allegory
01:06:13 like he's like at the top of
01:06:15 like the ecological food chain
01:06:17 like Titans are like reversing the
01:06:19 damage done by man to the environment
01:06:21 and shit and that's kind of cringe
01:06:23 but it's more like relevant to western audiences
01:06:25 but it kind of like
01:06:27 reduces Godzilla what he was supposed to be
01:06:29 like thematically but like half the movies
01:06:31 are just like him fighting with
01:06:33 robots and like has nothing to do with that
01:06:35 message anymore anyway so I don't get too bent out of shape about it
01:06:37 but um
01:06:39 it's kind of strange but there's
01:06:41 the punchings really good and like this is
01:06:43 the only time you're ever going to see like
01:06:45 these classic monsters rendered
01:06:47 in such high detail animating really subtly
01:06:49 that you can't get out of rubber suits
01:06:51 so for the novelty of that alone I enjoy
01:06:53 them a lot because it's kind of how my child brain
01:06:55 imagined all the fights happening
01:06:57 on screen when I watch them when I was five like seeing
01:06:59 that realized in real time is kind of cool
01:07:01 okay
01:07:03 but
01:07:05 King Kong
01:07:07 flanged or unflanged he's
01:07:09 flanged because he's not in orangutan
01:07:11 no that's why he lost
01:07:13 yeah
01:07:15 he was a flanged orangutan
01:07:17 he's been flanged
01:07:19 Godzilla's not flanged
01:07:21 no not at all
01:07:23 so it was Godzilla supposed to be like a gorilla
01:07:25 he looks like one
01:07:27 I mean no Godzilla
01:07:29 King Kong yeah yeah
01:07:31 he's a gorilla man
01:07:33 I'm going to find some gorilla facts
01:07:35 one of the he's perhaps the greatest of them all
01:07:37 oh no
01:07:39 he's the king
01:07:41 oh god
01:07:43 alright let's look up some gorilla facts
01:07:45 here we go
01:07:47 I might not find anything really funny
01:07:49 I know that gorillas can bench press
01:07:51 like five thousand pounds
01:07:53 they're like so fucking strong it's insane
01:07:55 but like they're also
01:07:57 they have to eat like
01:07:59 constantly
01:08:01 they constantly have to be eating
01:08:03 because they're muscles
01:08:05 they're talking energy
01:08:07 inefficient
01:08:09 the movie had the funniest opening scene
01:08:11 of any movie ever
01:08:13 it was like some song was playing
01:08:15 and it was just Kong waking up
01:08:17 and going through his day like a person
01:08:19 like taking a shower and a waterfall
01:08:21 oh okay
01:08:23 like treating him like he's just a person getting up
01:08:25 like you know how they do that in movies
01:08:27 like the movie starts and someone like wakes up
01:08:29 and goes about their morning routine
01:08:31 but it was just a big giant monster
01:08:33 it was a ten out of ten way to start
01:08:35 hilarious
01:08:37 I just opened up the Wikipedia article for gorilla
01:08:39 and I saw a picture of a gorilla
01:08:41 and I thought what if I was
01:08:43 standing where the photographer was
01:08:45 looking at this gorilla
01:08:47 with him looking back at me
01:08:49 and I'm so fucking scared
01:08:51 I would hope that they're using a zoom lens
01:08:53 in a very far away
01:08:55 if he wanted to
01:08:57 and he probably does
01:08:59 he could just lope over to me in like seconds
01:09:01 and then he'd head off and rip me limb from limb
01:09:03 and it would just be a funny joke to him
01:09:05 yeah but look at his expression
01:09:07 he's gonna do it
01:09:09 he looks like he's thinking about it
01:09:11 it's like
01:09:13 you're looking like a snack right there
01:09:15 he's like
01:09:17 it would be funny if I just
01:09:19 if I just bifurcated
01:09:21 that guy right now
01:09:25 and he's right
01:09:27 it would be funny that's the fucked up part
01:09:29 to be effective
01:09:31 if I had a
01:09:33 if I just had a wand
01:09:35 if I had a wand with
01:09:37 all I need is one
01:09:39 mana
01:09:41 one mana reducer
01:09:43 and one
01:09:45 and a chainsaw
01:09:47 and a good old fashioned multicast
01:09:49 in the fight of gorilla versus ben
01:09:51 give ben a wand and prep time
01:09:53 he can beat anybody
01:09:55 I can beat any animal
01:09:57 prep time
01:09:59 easy that's my superpower
01:10:05 they're fucking scary
01:10:07 I've learned the only gorilla fact I need to know
01:10:09 which is that they're scary as fuck
01:10:11 they're so big and they can look at you
01:10:13 and be like
01:10:15 they're so big
01:10:17 that I poop my fucking pants
01:10:19 and even think about them
01:10:23 today's gorilla fact
01:10:25 gorillas will make you poop your pants
01:10:27 with fear
01:10:31 that's pretty fucked up
01:10:33 it's pretty fucked up how they evolved to do that
01:10:35 but I mean I guess nature is pissed
01:10:39 well it's like human reflex
01:10:41 if you poop your pants
01:10:43 then you way less
01:10:45 so that you can run away faster
01:10:47 makes sense
01:10:49 oh
01:10:51 they're poached for bush meat
01:10:55 like Australia
01:10:57 what's bush meat
01:10:59 bush meat is meat from wildlife
01:11:01 species that are hunted for human consumption
01:11:03 oh so meat
01:11:05 so meat is what you're describing
01:11:07 I think they mean like
01:11:09 non farmed animals
01:11:13 yeah I guess
01:11:15 it'd be like not allowed
01:11:17 meat
01:11:21 oh bush meat
01:11:23 is not
01:11:25 bush meat is not to be confused with bush food
01:11:27 which is
01:11:29 any food native to Australia
01:11:31 and used as sustenance by indigenous Australians
01:11:33 so
01:11:35 okay
01:11:37 alright
01:11:39 no bush
01:11:41 I guess people fucking hunt gorillas for meat
01:11:43 that's so fucked
01:11:45 a silverback gorilla is typically
01:11:47 more than 12 years of age
01:11:49 so he's basically a twink
01:11:51 that he's gonna kill you
01:11:53 if you hunt a gorilla
01:11:55 and kill it for meat
01:11:57 that sounds like a way for a human to become flanged
01:11:59 that's pretty alpha
01:12:01 taking down a gorilla
01:12:03 I think you have to beat him
01:12:05 you have to fight him gorilla style
01:12:07 which you can't do
01:12:09 you simply can't
01:12:11 you have to beat him with no prep time
01:12:13 Tarzan it's possible
01:12:15 true Tarzan did fucking wreck shit
01:12:17 and he could surf on vines
01:12:19 he was pretty cool
01:12:21 I think he could surf on vines
01:12:23 but I don't think he could beat a gorilla in a fist fight
01:12:25 no no no do you remember the movie
01:12:27 where he got
01:12:29 no I haven't actually
01:12:31 seen the movie
01:12:33 you haven't seen Tarzan the movie Disney
01:12:35 TM
01:12:37 we just mentioned the movie and got a copyright claim
01:12:39 from Disney
01:12:41 this is a classic film Ben
01:12:43 well
01:12:45 did you not see the film
01:12:47 no I have not seen the film wait I've got
01:12:49 oh my god
01:12:51 what are you looking at a gorilla again
01:12:53 are you pooping your pants
01:12:55 no I'm sorry I got a message on
01:12:57 I got a discord message that is like
01:12:59 disturbing me a little bit
01:13:01 I'm sorry is it relevant
01:13:03 or secret
01:13:05 okay wait hold on
01:13:07 hold on
01:13:09 at least I cut this stuff

01:13:15 sorry about that
01:13:17 boo
01:13:19 sorry
01:13:21 I had to
01:13:23 I got some
01:13:25 weird shit was going on with my discord
01:13:27 but I guess it's fixed now
01:13:29 sorry everyone
01:13:31 for that awkward pause at Eleazar Cut
01:13:33 ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
01:13:35 the awkward pause they wouldn't know about
01:13:37 if you didn't know
01:13:39 but I'm mentioning it
01:13:41 Ben answer the question
01:13:43 what's the question
01:13:45 have you seen Tarzan the film
01:13:47 I think I've seen
01:13:49 most of it
01:13:51 I don't honestly I'm not sure
01:13:53 I might not have seen it actually
01:13:55 do you remember it from the Kingdom Hearts level
01:13:57 I remember Tarzan surfing
01:13:59 on vines
01:14:01 I vaguely remember the Kingdom Hearts level
01:14:03 I remember Phil Collins
01:14:05 yeah
01:14:07 you basically remember
01:14:09 I think I've probably watched
01:14:11 the first half of it a couple times
01:14:13 the Phil Collins soundtrack
01:14:15 is unironically based
01:14:17 I've listened to it by myself
01:14:19 like by itself
01:14:21 before and it's just
01:14:23 that guy knows how to play a drum and sing
01:14:25 honestly
01:14:27 my dad used to listen
01:14:29 to Phil Collins and as a kid I like
01:14:31 hated it I hated all the music my dad
01:14:33 liked but now I hear
01:14:35 Genesis and I'm like
01:14:37 okay this is kind of epic though
01:14:39 this is kind of fucking epic
01:14:41 it means you're getting old
01:14:43 it means I have taste now
01:14:45 that's how old people defend the fact that they're getting old
01:14:47 but my dad also likes
01:14:49 smooth jazz
01:14:51 and easy listening and I hate that shit
01:14:53 so it's not
01:14:55 it's not total crossover
01:14:57 everybody just likes Genesis
01:15:01 what's that one
01:15:03 what's that one
01:15:05 about the
01:15:07 easy lover
01:15:09 that's a good song
01:15:15 no singing
01:15:21 say something
01:15:23 for god's sake
01:15:25 are we ready already
01:15:27 we're giving up this fast
01:15:29 I guess we're an hour in you wanna go to voicemails
01:15:31 I was about to say it's pretty
01:15:33 pretty normal to go to voicemails
01:15:35 I guess we're an hour
01:15:37 this has gone by really fast
01:15:39 we only talked about one thing
01:15:41 this hour has blasted by
01:15:43 I haven't had much to talk about this week
01:15:45 because of the
01:15:47 previously said
01:15:49 trying to live
01:15:51 ouch
01:15:53 which sucks
01:15:55 I wanted to get back
01:15:57 I wanted to work on that comic idea
01:15:59 I think I have an idea
01:16:01 I need to get going
01:16:03 because the deadline for that thing
01:16:05 is the end of April
01:16:07 this is good
01:16:09 to mention it
01:16:11 I wanted to mention it again
01:16:13 the kato anthology
01:16:15 I believe the deadline is the end of April
01:16:17 if you want to submit your comics
01:16:19 to that
01:16:23 I mean
01:16:25 I don't know
01:16:27 what if I make a one page comic
01:16:29 and nothing happens
01:16:31 you could have something
01:16:33 you could have something happen in one page
01:16:35 no, no, it can't be done
01:16:37 it's a show about nothing
01:16:39 no, nothing happens Jerry
01:16:41 it's a four panel comic
01:16:43 and it's the same panel four times
01:16:45 I've done that before
01:16:47 I've made that twitter joke before
01:16:49 just have it be like
01:16:51 27 pages of the red man comic
01:16:53 link in the description
01:16:55 if you the listener are
01:16:57 or know a comic artist
01:16:59 who might be interested in having their work printed
01:17:01 for pay
01:17:03 you keep all your intellectual property rights
01:17:05 in the kato anthology
01:17:07 they're gonna be starting a kickstarter for it
01:17:09 I don't exactly know when but soon
01:17:11 soon after the deadline
01:17:13 which is the end of April for submissions
01:17:15 check it out
01:17:17 if you please
01:17:21 so what are you saying
01:17:23 you're a bitch
01:17:25 I'm gonna do it
01:17:27 I'm just sort of
01:17:29 fucking stupid
01:17:31 oh, I see
01:17:33 technically I could have been trying to work
01:17:35 while sick
01:17:37 but I feel like I don't want it
01:17:39 well, that's hard
01:17:41 yeah, it's hard
01:17:43 that doesn't work well
01:17:49 I had something happen
01:17:51 especially like just
01:17:53 today
01:17:55 and like last night and this morning
01:17:57 I got messaged by
01:17:59 on twitter
01:18:01 by one of the
01:18:03 people
01:18:05 who I constantly see
01:18:07 replying to Christine Weston Chandler
01:18:09 on twitter
01:18:11 calling her all kinds of terrible things
01:18:13 saying all kinds of nasty stuff about her
01:18:15 you're a pervert
01:18:17 you're a predator
01:18:19 you're a pedophile
01:18:21 and I
01:18:23 and you know
01:18:25 I don't like these people
01:18:27 it's really bizarre
01:18:29 they respond to everything Chris does
01:18:31 and I hate them and I don't like it
01:18:33 it's an ugly look
01:18:35 so this person messages me
01:18:37 I don't even remember why
01:18:39 and it doesn't really matter
01:18:41 but she said something
01:18:43 about that
01:18:45 and then she was like wait
01:18:47 you're the guy who did that lecture
01:18:49 you a white knight now
01:18:51 that doesn't make any sense
01:18:53 and I'm like listen
01:18:55 I respond to her and I'm like listen
01:18:57 quit stalking Chris
01:18:59 on twitter
01:19:01 it's pathetic
01:19:03 it's bizarre
01:19:05 it's not a good look and it doesn't
01:19:07 accomplish anything so just knock it off
01:19:09 and she
01:19:11 replied to me
01:19:13 well first I mean
01:19:15 she said
01:19:17 in her poorly spelled
01:19:19 grammatically
01:19:21 semi-coherent
01:19:23 rant back to me
01:19:25 she included
01:19:27 many a transphobic
01:19:29 comments which did not
01:19:31 sit well with me but
01:19:33 in a mix among there
01:19:35 was the sentiment that
01:19:37 like Chris sent me
01:19:39 unsolicited dick pics
01:19:41 and so that's why I hate them
01:19:43 and think they're a pervert
01:19:45 and continually
01:19:47 doing this
01:19:49 and I had to take a step back and be like
01:19:51 you know
01:19:53 that is a legitimate grievance that this person has
01:19:55 so
01:19:57 maybe I partly feel a little bad
01:19:59 for scolding them about it
01:20:01 but at the same time
01:20:03 it's still not productive
01:20:05 what they're doing
01:20:07 it's still not helping anything
01:20:09 you can have a legitimate grievance
01:20:11 while taking action that in no way
01:20:13 you can get rid of that problem
01:20:15 or settle that grievance
01:20:17 right
01:20:19 so I guess I felt a little abashed
01:20:21 like
01:20:23 I hadn't considered that
01:20:25 maybe Chris actually had done something
01:20:27 which I guess she did
01:20:31 but I guess it doesn't change my opinion
01:20:33 that much
01:20:35 I still think they should just stop
01:20:37 I don't know
01:20:39 so I guess I felt
01:20:41 weird about that
01:20:43 I don't know
01:20:45 how else to describe
01:20:47 I don't know what else to say about that
01:20:49 but that was a funny story
01:20:51 that happened to me
01:20:53 believe it
01:20:55 alright
01:20:57 voicemails
01:20:59 for sure
01:21:01 bass
01:21:03 let's get over to
01:21:05 speakpipe.com
01:21:07 slash
01:21:09 pcp voicemail
01:21:11 speak
01:21:13 there's so many
01:21:15 it's okay we'll blast through
01:21:17 we'll go so fast
01:21:19 speakpipe.com
01:21:21 you're correct
01:21:23 if we go to the second page
01:21:25 the first one here is called
01:21:27 five months late
01:21:29 are we ready
01:21:31 here we go
01:21:33 three two one go
01:21:35 I haven't caught up to the newest pcp episodes
01:21:37 but when I just watched, Tom essentially said
01:21:39 that people who have a problem with the gender binary
01:21:41 should try to get rid of gender language altogether
01:21:43 instead of adding more choices that people have to learn
01:21:45 as a probably cis male
01:21:47 I think that both of these are valid ways of abolishing gender
01:21:49 so I support both
01:21:51 if you get rid of gender language then boom
01:21:53 gender language is gone, cool
01:21:55 but if you keep adding more choices that essentially reaches the same result
01:21:57 where the way you refer to someone becomes an expression of identity
01:21:59 title
01:22:01 or even just something akin to a name
01:22:03 by virtue of there just being so many choices
01:22:05 that are based on gender
01:22:07 and becomes an individualistic thing
01:22:09 I do remember what he's talking about
01:22:11 and what I was saying wasn't that
01:22:13 that was the better choice
01:22:15 the point was that it would be
01:22:17 easier for people to understand
01:22:19 because I think a lot of people get confused
01:22:21 by
01:22:23 non-binary gender pronouns
01:22:25 and by trying to reduce choices
01:22:27 and make things simpler
01:22:29 it's easier for most people to understand and to make things more complicated
01:22:31 I don't know
01:22:33 I don't know anyone
01:22:35 I don't see anybody using
01:22:37 like neopronouns
01:22:39 they don't seem to be
01:22:41 I don't feel like they caught on
01:22:43 no, I kind of think
01:22:45 maybe that's for the best
01:22:47 it's just ammo for
01:22:49 bad actors to use
01:22:51 well, well
01:22:53 I don't like that argument
01:22:55 I don't like that argument because
01:22:57 that sort of places the blame
01:22:59 I don't think it's a blame thing
01:23:01 it's a little bit like
01:23:03 they were asking for it
01:23:05 that's harsh
01:23:07 that's harsh to say
01:23:09 but I feel like it's kind of the same
01:23:11 like
01:23:13 I think I should criticize it
01:23:15 because it's like
01:23:17 it's less efficient or whatever
01:23:19 I don't know
01:23:21 no
01:23:23 maybe I just didn't
01:23:25 I never got it
01:23:27 I guess I'm just personally I never got it
01:23:29 I'm personally glad that it hasn't caught on
01:23:31 so I haven't had to reckon with it
01:23:33 I mean
01:23:35 all of the sort of gender stuff
01:23:37 at one point for me
01:23:39 was confusing
01:23:41 but I've gotten used to what little
01:23:43 changes I've had to make
01:23:45 right
01:23:47 I feel like naturally
01:23:49 people have just accepted that it's easier
01:23:51 to just say
01:23:53 he, she and they
01:23:55 as the three main things
01:23:57 and
01:23:59 special words
01:24:01 are sort of
01:24:03 not really
01:24:05 that you can have them
01:24:07 and I guess
01:24:09 if I met a person who
01:24:11 tried to use them
01:24:13 I would use them for that person
01:24:15 like in wider society
01:24:17 it's so confusing having more than three
01:24:19 I don't think people are ready to
01:24:21 like branch out
01:24:23 I don't think they need to but I'm not known
01:24:25 non-binary so I don't know
01:24:27 whether there's some like yearning
01:24:29 for a special word that isn't they
01:24:31 maybe some people feel like that
01:24:33 I hope they
01:24:35 as the default becomes
01:24:37 more normalized
01:24:39 I think we should all just
01:24:41 default to that and use it
01:24:43 as more
01:24:45 I think it's great
01:24:47 I like it
01:24:49 everyone's a they
01:24:51 it's better this way
01:24:53 it's they
01:24:55 and then their literal name
01:24:57 it's they way
01:24:59 or the highway
01:25:01 yeah
01:25:03 got them
01:25:05 okay next voicemail is called
01:25:07 noita sucks lol
01:25:09 okay three two one go
01:25:11 no it is a piece of your game because
01:25:13 when you go on top of the mountain to get the orb that's cool
01:25:15 but then you have to go across the desert to get the other orb
01:25:17 that's bullshit you have to go way too far
01:25:19 and it takes too much time to get just 25 health
01:25:21 in any ways because you don't want to give yourself a disadvantage
01:25:23 but of course it didn't matter anyways
01:25:25 because you got shit rng that run
01:25:27 and the first three floors there's no fucking good ones
01:25:29 and you have nothing and you get to the fourth floor
01:25:31 and you die and you know what
01:25:33 that doesn't matter because you already died because you crossed the fucking lava lake
01:25:35 and you got killed by that
01:25:37 you're a freaking nerd don't go for the desert orb
01:25:39 you still fucking killed you because
01:25:41 you got stuck on a fucking rock
01:25:43 and it's like
01:25:45 in the fucking game it's terrible like the first floor
01:25:47 it's like you get terrible rng every time
01:25:49 you go for the gold
01:25:51 you go for the gold biome
01:25:53 first thing every run you freaking dweeb
01:25:55 no you just go down the holy mountain
01:25:57 you just go down the mountain
01:25:59 and pray for a chainsaw
01:26:01 if you put it on your wand you go
01:26:11 because you're stupid and you didn't pick electric immunity
01:26:15 you fucking idiot
01:26:17 and that doesn't matter because
01:26:19 the only way you can win this shitty game
01:26:21 is if you get good rng
01:26:23 like literally you're just trying to get like
01:26:25 winning is so easy
01:26:27 every fucking game
01:26:29 or some other garbage
01:26:31 there's so many more ways to do it
01:26:33 you just don't know
01:26:35 you just don't understand
01:26:37 that's true, mana plus is the most
01:26:39 you don't need it
01:26:41 you don't need it
01:26:43 it's just way easier if you have it
01:26:45 this person is a fucking dweeb
01:26:47 that felt like a
01:26:49 ye old PCP argument
01:26:51 right in my living room
01:26:53 it really did
01:26:55 god, imagine
01:26:57 is it a nightmare and do I cry
01:26:59 if I don't get any chainsaws
01:27:01 or I don't get any spark bolt with triggers
01:27:03 or I don't get any mana reducers
01:27:05 yes
01:27:07 but you can still win
01:27:09 you can still win without those things
01:27:11 it's winning is trivial
01:27:13 winning is trivial
01:27:15 you're a freaking...
01:27:17 imagine what a fucking dork you have to be
01:27:19 to start your run and be like
01:27:21 op, but I mean
01:27:23 you can't start the run
01:27:25 by going to the...
01:27:27 what do you go down in the mountain
01:27:29 and you look for levitatium so you can get over the hill
01:27:31 and walk over the... you're not supposed to do that
01:27:33 you're just supposed to go down the mountain
01:27:35 yeah, you can be a...
01:27:37 oh, I'll spend an hour walking over to the
01:27:39 desert and get that extra 25
01:27:41 you just go
01:27:43 and you shoot everything
01:27:45 and you get
01:27:47 the hearts and you get
01:27:49 the chainsaws and you go
01:27:51 and that's it
01:27:53 and you just do it really fast
01:27:55 and you just blast through and if you get bad rng
01:27:57 good, it took you 5 seconds to get here
01:27:59 so you just do it again
01:28:01 that's how you
01:28:03 fucking win the game
01:28:05 in my opinion
01:28:07 okay
01:28:09 next voicemail

01:33:49 PCP
01:33:51 I'm still struggling to
01:33:53 get over it
01:33:55 but at the end of the day
01:33:57 it was her choice
01:33:59 and I hope she'll eventually decide to come on
01:34:01 even if it's like on an episode
01:34:03 to say goodbye
01:34:05 I just want you all to be true to yourselves
01:34:07 and maybe it's time to
01:34:09 start looking for recruitment again
01:34:11 and again
01:34:15 hmm
01:34:17 we've such an illustrious history of bringing people in
01:34:19 we've never looked for recruitment in the first time
01:34:21 no
01:34:23 there will be no recruitment
01:34:25 there will be no
01:34:27 you gotta be grandfathered in
01:34:29 that's true you gotta be grandfathered in
01:34:31 new members
01:34:33 they only poison the well
01:34:35 we gotta keep the bloodlines pure
01:34:37 we can only breed with each other
01:34:39 no
01:34:41 that's how it's gotta be
01:34:43 they can't fuck

01:34:59 being
01:35:01 sad that Trixie has left
01:35:03 I nevertheless
01:35:05 recognize that it is a valid
01:35:07 response and I empathize
01:35:09 with the general concept
01:35:11 of sadness
01:35:13 LeMau

01:39:11 relate to of course
01:39:13 know why I really fucking hate the cast
01:39:15 button on my phone
01:39:17 do you know how annoying it is
01:39:19 when you're playing with your whatchamado
01:39:21 cast button and then suddenly you
01:39:23 accidentally press the cast button
01:39:25 and then oh look at that
01:39:27 now all your roommates know you jack off the tranny
01:39:29 porn and they're like wow
01:39:31 look at this huge fucking faggot
01:39:33 he likes jacking it off to lady boys
01:39:35 and you know what
01:39:37 maybe I fucking like it okay
01:39:39 it's not your goddamn business you'll have to
01:39:41 fucking look at it stop judging me
01:39:43 anyway I hope
01:39:45 there's a later setting that's introduced
01:39:47 where I can turn off the cast button
01:39:49 anyway uh tell me what you think I should do
01:39:51 about this problem
01:39:53 uh embrace it stop getting so
01:39:55 worked up about people seeing the porn
01:39:57 you watch you should just
01:39:59 you should be
01:40:01 proud
01:40:03 of yourself
01:40:05 proud of your boy
01:40:07 I'll make you proud of your boy
01:40:11 just switch to a browser that doesn't have
01:40:13 a cast that you built in
01:40:15 just be proud to be a faggot
01:40:17 I guess is all I can say
01:40:19 I mean it's cool
01:40:21 look it's not it's not it's not wrong
01:40:23 to like a penis no matter
01:40:25 what your sexual orientation
01:40:27 because penises are funny
01:40:31 no they're serious no
01:40:33 shut up they're serious business
01:40:35 you gotta fucking
01:40:37 take them for
01:40:39 for a spin
01:40:41 don't be late
01:40:43 what are you saying
01:40:47 next voicemail
01:40:49 please save me
01:40:51 next voicemail is called panic play
01:40:53 date three two one go
01:40:55 many months ago
01:40:57 tom had mentioned that there is an empty
01:40:59 space in our hearts
01:41:01 and minds that the game boy used
01:41:03 to fill and I think I have found
01:41:05 something that will fulfill that niche
01:41:07 it is um
01:41:09 called the panic play date
01:41:11 you should check it out
01:41:13 google it right now looks cool
01:41:15 it's designed by teenage engineering
01:41:17 um
01:41:19 it's like a game boy with a little crank
01:41:21 on the side like a fishing reel
01:41:23 so I would imagine that would be
01:41:25 an obvious choice of game
01:41:27 um
01:41:29 and yes the development
01:41:31 gets free and open source if you want to
01:41:33 mess around with it I have looked at it
01:41:35 but I'm very uncreative
01:41:37 what is the point
01:41:39 let me know what you think
01:41:41 I think it looks cool I'm excited for it
01:41:43 should be coming out later this year
01:41:45 and I
01:41:47 I'm really really curious as to
01:41:49 what people do with the crank
01:41:51 um yeah I remember
01:41:53 seeing this a while ago
01:41:55 uh like announced like ah
01:41:57 it's a revolutionary new idea
01:41:59 it's a thing that looks a little bit like a game boy
01:42:01 so you remember it so you're just nostalgic
01:42:03 and it's got some sort of games on it
01:42:05 and you crank the crank
01:42:07 to charge the battery and also
01:42:09 it's a gameplay feature thingy
01:42:11 it's like a Nintendo
01:42:13 esque gimmick
01:42:15 I'm like eh cool I guess
01:42:17 okay
01:42:19 how many things do you want a crank
01:42:21 well that's the whole thing
01:42:23 I feel like the crank is probably going to do more harm than good
01:42:25 I feel like it was a gimmick idea that probably
01:42:27 should not have been included
01:42:29 yeah but it's
01:42:31 I mean without the crank
01:42:33 just a knockoff game boy
01:42:35 I think if they yeah that's why they have the crank
01:42:37 uh maybe
01:42:39 they don't have like good games I don't think
01:42:41 I don't think the games are what they're selling it on
01:42:43 it's just the game I'm assuming it's a platform
01:42:45 and I don't see why I would want that
01:42:47 it's an open platform that people can develop for
01:42:49 kind of like kind of like how pico a got big
01:42:51 hmm
01:42:53 yeah so
01:42:55 so it sounds like they should have just embraced the fact
01:42:57 that they're just a knockoff game boy
01:42:59 and just let people develop for that
01:43:01 I mean there's a whole market for like
01:43:03 knockoff game boys that like people like
01:43:05 so yeah
01:43:07 I don't I guess I don't mind the idea
01:43:09 of like having like a crank for like different
01:43:11 kind of like gameplay experiments
01:43:13 and like people probably do cool things with it
01:43:15 but I'm just thinking like
01:43:17 like when I think of a game boy I think of something I can
01:43:19 easily place in my pocket and that crank is going to
01:43:21 fuck that up it's going to be annoying to have to
01:43:23 like oh gotta move the crank and
01:43:25 it'll get caught in my pocket trying to take it out
01:43:27 yeah
01:43:29 yeah it looks it's going to be jutting
01:43:31 out I wish it could like fold it in
01:43:33 or something
01:43:35 can you can you like
01:43:37 I don't know maybe
01:43:39 up in the back when you're not
01:43:41 when you're not cranking it
01:43:43 yeah I can see on the Wikipedia
01:43:45 there's an image of it
01:43:47 but I'm also
01:43:49 seeing
01:43:51 how much is it that's important if it's over
01:43:53 $99 it's a failure
01:43:55 like that was a great thing about game boys
01:43:57 they were like disposable and didn't cost a lot of money
01:43:59 notable indie game
01:44:01 developers such as
01:44:03 Keita Takahashi which is the guy who made
01:44:05 Katamari so
01:44:07 he's making a game for it
01:44:09 uh cranking times
01:44:11 time travel adventure I like that guy
01:44:13 he's really cool so
01:44:15 I'll have a look at that
01:44:19 fascinating
01:44:21 uh
01:44:23 cranking time travel adventure
01:44:25 gameplay
01:44:27 it's $150
01:44:29 it's a little pricey
01:44:35 yeah
01:44:37 I mean
01:44:39 it's also yellow the worst color
01:44:41 I would have to see like what
01:44:43 I mean if it had really quality
01:44:45 games I feel like $150 is fair
01:44:47 but I mean does it
01:44:49 is the question
01:44:51 every console lives or dies by its library
01:44:53 sure yeah sure
01:44:57 oh it does
01:44:59 it does kind of tuck itself in
01:45:01 well that's good
01:45:03 that's much better
01:45:05 if it couldn't do that it would be really annoying
01:45:07 yeah that's true
01:45:09 I don't know
01:45:11 it's like mostly consolidated there
01:45:13 that's pretty solid
01:45:15 uh
01:45:17 next one
01:45:19 yeah
01:45:21 next one is called Kyoto Ninja Clan
01:45:23 3, 2, 1, go

01:47:01 we're here to cut him down
01:47:03 to size
01:47:05 and snap him like he was a twig
01:47:07 this hog had had a reason

01:47:11 regret
01:47:13 an order from the city
01:47:15 mayor
01:47:25 to shut down machines
01:47:27 and there
01:47:29 there was a little pig

01:50:29 next voicemail is called
01:50:31 Joker rap needs critique
01:50:33 3, 2, 1, go
01:50:37 hi PCP
01:50:39 it's me out of character
01:50:41 I need some
01:50:43 feedback on this
01:50:45 Joker rap I'm making about the Joker
01:50:47 okay so here it goes
01:50:49 most guys eat mice
01:50:51 the Joker eats plaster
01:50:53 most guys drive slow
01:50:55 the Joker drives faster
01:50:57 most guys can't shit
01:50:59 the Joker is a master
01:51:01 most guys can't do magic
01:51:03 but the Joker is a caster
01:51:05 most guys can't do math
01:51:07 the Joker knows all the factors
01:51:09 most guys think they're safe
01:51:11 the Joker is bringing a disaster
01:51:13 rabbits love breeding
01:51:15 the Joker is busy defeating
01:51:17 most guys are betas
01:51:19 but the Joker is alpha leading
01:51:21 okay that's it
01:51:23 the actors
01:51:25 does not fit I think
01:51:27 I think maybe trim down
01:51:29 the ones that don't work as well
01:51:31 I keep all of the best ones
01:51:33 I think
01:51:35 the one
01:51:37 the Joker knows all the factors
01:51:39 there's too many syllables
01:51:41 the Joker knows factors
01:51:45 the one that's
01:51:47 syllable synchronicity
01:51:49 I like how the Joker is a master
01:51:51 of shitting
01:51:53 he never
01:51:55 shits off more than he can prove
01:51:59 that's what we've learned about the Joker today
01:52:03 um
01:52:05 that's what was my favorite line personally
01:52:07 um

01:54:13 no
01:54:15 don't make it to make a reflex save
01:54:17 sounds like we're talking about mechanics
01:54:19 they mutter amongst themselves
01:54:21 unsure of whether bitcoin
01:54:23 bin was the only person
01:54:25 with bitcoins in that fortress
01:54:27 or whether
01:54:29 that lone figure up above
01:54:31 may have some as well

01:57:07 in line of sight when you fell I would cast
01:57:09 feather fall on you and that would drop
01:57:11 concentration and so I'd have to lose my
01:57:13 visibility and then I'll try
01:57:15 how come you get to be a wizard
01:57:17 I don't know because Tom says
01:57:19 anything it was just
01:57:21 I'm playing a sorcerer
01:57:23 in the game I'm actually playing right now so
01:57:27 likely story
01:57:29 you're a fucking
01:57:31 you're trying to
01:57:33 ensorcel us right now with these fanciful
01:57:35 tales you're spinning
01:57:37 these yarns
01:57:39 I pick up my wand which has
01:57:41 no all the buffs
01:57:43 and I cast chain saw
01:57:45 on everything
01:57:47 yeah that's it
01:57:49 I hope to god you've stacked it
01:57:51 with a mana reducer I just pray
01:57:55 okay
01:57:57 sounds good
01:57:59 DM
01:58:01 let me roll
01:58:03 for initiative please
01:58:05 okay next voicemail is called
01:58:07 Ben's tweets to Trixie
01:58:09 feel free to skip if old news
01:58:11 no I will not skip
01:58:13 3, 2, 1, go
01:58:17 I don't know if this will be like old and dead news
01:58:19 by the time
01:58:21 you respond to this but
01:58:23 regarding like all of the
01:58:25 Trixie drama on Twitter
01:58:27 and Ben's say in response to it
01:58:29 I actually really appreciate
01:58:31 Ben's tweets even though they are
01:58:33 pretty harsh and
01:58:35 kind of getting like a little bit
01:58:37 maybe mean-spirited at a certain point
01:58:39 but just like
01:58:41 as like a PCP
01:58:43 fan it has been very frustrating
01:58:45 to see the situation with Trixie
01:58:47 so it's actually somewhat
01:58:49 cathartic to have someone just kind of like
01:58:51 speak out and just
01:58:53 nope the whole situation there
01:58:55 so I mean I hope
01:58:57 you don't keep on doing it you know
01:58:59 forever because that would be a little bit immature
01:59:01 but it just
01:59:03 has been it
01:59:05 it feels
01:59:07 feels nice in a weird way
01:59:09 but yeah I've been really liking the episodes
01:59:11 of the podcast recently I feel like
01:59:13 they kind of hit a slump when more
01:59:15 of the members left but recently
01:59:17 it's been hitting a really good stride so
01:59:19 I don't know here's to our episodes
01:59:21 sorry about this one
01:59:23 yeah
01:59:25 I wouldn't
01:59:27 I wasn't going to do it
01:59:29 I wasn't going to say anything
01:59:31 the only reason I did
01:59:33 is because
01:59:35 Trixie's crew
01:59:37 stepped on my fucking toes
01:59:39 stepped on our collective toes
01:59:41 and that's the only reason why it had to
01:59:43 come to this
01:59:45 I have been
01:59:47 frustrated watching Trixie do
01:59:49 everything for a long time
01:59:51 now
01:59:53 is it frustrating
01:59:55 is it embarrassing yes
01:59:57 but it's not my business I was just going to leave her to it
01:59:59 but
02:00:01 there's a point when it becomes my problem
02:00:03 and
02:00:05 that's what happened
02:00:07 so
02:00:09 thanks for the voicemail
02:00:11 next one
02:00:13 is called Roger Roger
02:00:15 three two one
02:00:17 go
02:00:19 so now that Trixie left the show to burn every bridge
02:00:21 she has ever made
02:00:23 why not try to fix some of the old ones
02:00:25 talking monkey and Jeff baby
02:00:27 hit them up see if they want to come back
02:00:29 for an episode I'm sure they'd be happy to hear from you guys
02:00:31 anyway
02:00:33 PCP forever
02:00:35 Tom will never die
02:00:37 call me back
02:00:39 I certainly hope not
02:00:41 Tom alone will
02:00:43 live to upload his consciousness
02:00:45 into the fucking cyber mainframe
02:00:47 this is the first chance I get
02:00:53 I mean Jeff
02:00:55 I don't feel like Jeff knows us at all
02:00:57 I think Jeff was the only
02:00:59 but it would be hilarious if we got Jeff
02:01:01 it would be funny
02:01:03 it's hilarious in concept
02:01:05 in concept only
02:01:07 I guess I would do it just for the gag
02:01:09 but I have no idea what I would
02:01:11 say to Jeff
02:01:13 and I mean kind of the same for monkey
02:01:15 like what do I have to say to monkey
02:01:17 there's just so much time that's passed
02:01:19 now it's just like
02:01:21 it's a different person
02:01:23 really
02:01:25 it's yeah
02:01:27 it's I mean I've thought about it
02:01:29 like I've tossed
02:01:31 around the idea of like wouldn't it be funny
02:01:33 if we had monkey
02:01:35 I asked monkey to guess but like
02:01:37 do I really want to
02:01:39 not really
02:01:43 my heart of hearts it's not what I desire
02:01:45 against a monkey return
02:01:47 I don't really hate monkey
02:01:49 or anything it's just sort of like
02:01:51 I just don't want to talk to him
02:01:55 I mean it would be fine to have like
02:01:57 my logic on again but I don't want to
02:01:59 yeah
02:02:01 yeah
02:02:03 I sort of yeah
02:02:05 it's kind of similar
02:02:07 not that they're equivalent it's just the same sort of feeling I have
02:02:09 nothing would come of that
02:02:11 I don't feel for me
02:02:13 yeah
02:02:15 I guess I agree
02:02:17 okay next one is called literally me
02:02:19 three two one go
02:02:21 and the podcast
02:02:23 go back to being an alt right
02:02:25 podcast now
02:02:27 leave
02:02:29 no
02:02:31 no alt right
02:02:33 it could though it could though
02:02:35 no Ben Ben
02:02:37 but I'm dying
02:02:39 everyone says I'm right on Twitter
02:02:41 and it feels good so I think
02:02:43 maybe I should start leaning
02:02:45 into it maybe I should start leaning
02:02:47 into it
02:02:49 oh god
02:02:51 I've always led
02:02:53 you know I've always led an alternative
02:02:55 lifestyle what if I let an
02:02:57 alt right
02:02:59 turn it right
02:03:01 keep joking about it I'm gonna have to start saying
02:03:03 things like vowsh
02:03:05 mmm
02:03:07 mmm
02:03:11 Bosch hasn't made a video on it so I don't have
02:03:13 an opinion Bosch hasn't made a video on the PCP
02:03:15 so I don't know what I feel about it
02:03:17 I don't know
02:03:19 it's it's it's
02:03:21 it's hard to say it's just
02:03:23 it's just so complicated
02:03:25 I need that man I need that man
02:03:27 to cut through the bullshit
02:03:29 I need that man to slap
02:03:31 his hands together
02:03:33 when you look at comments
02:03:35 on like the the lectures like
02:03:37 specifically I look at the anamorphs and the guiltier
02:03:39 lectures obviously because like they're the ones I do
02:03:41 and there's just tons of people being like
02:03:43 are they
02:03:45 seriously misogynist and I'm just like
02:03:47 can you really not tell
02:03:49 it's a joke like
02:03:51 I don't even I don't even remember
02:03:53 like what are they talking about
02:03:55 like there are some times when like in the
02:03:57 anamorphs one where Nate is like
02:03:59 saying like haha a woman wrote this lol
02:04:01 but like clearly as a joke
02:04:03 and like it happens like twice I think and it's just
02:04:05 like
02:04:07 yeah I don't know like
02:04:09 I don't yeah
02:04:11 yeah what
02:04:13 I guess what is there are they are they really
02:04:15 misogynist you really can't read the room
02:04:17 at all I don't fucking know
02:04:19 like I haven't
02:04:21 yeah I haven't watched in a while but like
02:04:23 I assume I assume
02:04:25 there's laughter and it's like
02:04:27 a yeah so
02:04:29 the I don't know
02:04:31 it's I don't fucking know it's pretty funny
02:04:33 it's pretty funny that a woman wrote a
02:04:35 book I mean yeah
02:04:37 what do they think of next I know it's crazy
02:04:39 Harry Potter
02:04:41 oh
02:04:43 see see this is why
02:04:45 women shouldn't be allowed to write books because then
02:04:47 because I mean we've seen what happened
02:04:49 we've seen what happened with JK Rowling
02:04:51 how many times are we going to let them get away with this
02:04:53 this has to be the last time we have to put
02:04:55 our foot down
02:04:57 we did it guys we're an alt-right podcast again
02:04:59 yeah
02:05:01 I will push back against this
02:05:03 damn damn
02:05:05 I don't feel strong enough to fight this
02:05:07 but I will I will just say
02:05:09 don't do that
02:05:11 get it Tom she's disease killer
02:05:13 while she's weak
02:05:15 no
02:05:17 she hasn't been drinking her water
02:05:19 you should be conscientious of others feelings
02:05:21 die nerd
02:05:23 that's what I say
02:05:25 when someone says
02:05:27 anything
02:05:29 we'll go full march Simpson on this ship
02:05:31 if you don't straighten up

02:08:09 I like that
02:08:11 that was
02:08:13 red school okay let's move on
02:08:15 next voicemail is called
02:08:17 Ben was even more right

02:08:21 you just keep getting righter and righter
02:08:23 just keep getting alter and alter
02:08:25 three two one go
02:08:27 more twitter drama
02:08:29 more correctness
02:08:31 from the king
02:08:33 keep it up
02:08:35 then
02:08:37 this is what it's all about
02:08:39 I do it all for this
02:08:41 for this moment
02:08:43 the king
02:08:45 voicemail that's me baby
02:08:47 say for those voicemails
02:08:51 I harvest the voicemails
02:08:53 that say I'm cool
02:08:55 I play them over and over again
02:08:57 I'm secretly
02:08:59 not playing all the voicemails
02:09:01 that say that I am
02:09:03 not right
02:09:05 they've all been
02:09:07 deleted
02:09:09 Ben goes through all the voicemails
02:09:11 the day before the podcast and clears
02:09:13 out all the ones he doesn't like
02:09:15 you all thought
02:09:17 that I wasn't doing that
02:09:19 but the joke's on you
02:09:21 I was
02:09:23 next voicemail is called
02:09:25 fear them three two one
02:09:27 go
02:09:37 what happened with the ninjutsu
02:09:51 okay
02:09:53 okay
02:09:55 see you next time
02:09:57 thank you for the warning
02:09:59 I guess
02:10:03 the saga gets more complicated
02:10:05 ninjas vs samurai who will win
02:10:09 samurai sounds like
02:10:11 he's on the rocks so
02:10:13 it sounds like the ninjas have grasped the upper hand
02:10:15 I've always been more of a ninja guy
02:10:17 than a samurai guy
02:10:19 samurai's my friend now
02:10:21 we've gone so far back
02:10:23 I think it's like because
02:10:25 you've stolen
02:10:27 samurai scrolls so long ago
02:10:29 that the samurai clan has deteriorated in that time
02:10:31 but the ninja clan
02:10:33 scroll has only recently been gone
02:10:35 so they've still got their full strength
02:10:37 that's a good point
02:10:39 that's a good point oh shit
02:10:41 oh my god wheels within wheels
02:10:45 next voicemail is called

02:15:27 pretty funny
02:15:29 there was one
02:15:31 I mean some people were
02:15:33 saying that the
02:15:35 the track that she
02:15:37 put out on April
02:15:39 Fools some people were speculating
02:15:41 that it was uh in response
02:15:43 to me
02:15:45 but it doesn't like it's not
02:15:47 specific like there are some lines in it that sound
02:15:49 like they could be about me but it's not like
02:15:51 it's kind of just a general
02:15:53 like haters
02:15:55 don't know shit
02:15:57 track so I don't know
02:15:59 I don't know if that's normal
02:16:01 it's fine to talk about haters
02:16:03 yeah pretty much
02:16:05 yeah it's not sure
02:16:07 sure well I hope
02:16:09 I hope they make a diss track about me I hope
02:16:11 I get some uh
02:16:13 you deserve
02:16:15 somebody needs to make a fucking diss track
02:16:17 about you it builds character
02:16:19 in which you are lacking
02:16:21 please
02:16:23 you need some
02:16:25 yeah
02:16:27 somebody diss track this fool
02:16:29 uh next voicemail
02:16:31 is called hi ben
02:16:33 it's another one called hi ben
02:16:35 okay three two one go
02:16:37 okay so
02:16:39 due to recent events
02:16:41 um
02:16:43 if Nate comes back on
02:16:45 the PCP
02:16:47 um
02:16:49 Ben can you just like
02:16:51 you'll be in charge
02:16:53 I like the culture you've cultivated here
02:16:55 thank you
02:16:57 with the whole not screening voicemails thing
02:16:59 I think it really adds up
02:17:01 to the show so
02:17:03 yeah I think Nate would hate it
02:17:05 just you and Gib just
02:17:07 stay in charge and Nate can be like a
02:17:09 special guest
02:17:11 I mean maybe
02:17:13 Nate maybe watch
02:17:15 um I mean
02:17:17 no no word
02:17:19 on whether Nate has
02:17:21 uh reconsidered
02:17:23 his
02:17:25 his status
02:17:27 of that so I mean
02:17:29 I mean I could come back
02:17:31 as it has always been a possibility
02:17:33 I see no reason to think that he will
02:17:35 but like it's like
02:17:37 like Nate left
02:17:39 like a wound to fester and now it's too powerful
02:17:41 and he can't treat it
02:17:43 if he tries to come back and be just
02:17:45 like the old times like hey everyone welcome to the
02:17:47 p-bro grassy podcast
02:17:49 we'd like to send upon him and
02:17:51 eat him and destroy him
02:17:53 too much has happened
02:17:55 we can never go back
02:17:57 to the way things were you can't go home again
02:17:59 once you give up your
02:18:01 PCP flange you can't get it back
02:18:05 you'd have to go through a
02:18:07 reflinging initiation ritual
02:18:09 we unflanged him
02:18:11 we unflanged him
02:18:13 and once lost a flange
02:18:15 he unflanged himself and walked away
02:18:17 that's true that's true he gave up the flange
02:18:19 it's truly the most
02:18:21 unflanged move to leave the PCP
02:18:25 I did have to agree
02:18:27 I would there's nothing
02:18:29 there's no more flanged
02:18:31 uh
02:18:33 thing to be us
02:18:37 we have the biggest flange
02:18:41 it's huge
02:18:43 okay uh next voicemail is called

02:20:37 he's putting himself out there
02:20:39 one of these days
02:20:41 I believe in him
02:20:43 I believe in him
02:20:45 this is the wheels
02:20:47 the wheels have started to turn
02:20:49 next voicemail is called
02:20:51 Mike Literis
02:20:53 lol 3 2 1 go
02:21:05 I still remember the ambitions you had vividly
02:21:07 I couldn't wait to check out which funny
02:21:09 yet touching artistic achievements just had created
02:21:11 in an effort to always surpass himself
02:21:13 as an artist while I was gone
02:21:15 I couldn't wait to see how many hundreds of thousands
02:21:17 of subscribers my favorite friendship simulator
02:21:19 had gained in my absence
02:21:21 just what wacky antics of my favorite
02:21:23 unironically fact it's loving online creator
02:21:25 Nate had I missed
02:21:27 also there's ban
02:21:29 just thinking about the abundance of artistic masterpieces
02:21:31 I'm wondering
02:21:33 about the abundance of artistic masterpieces
02:21:35 I must have missed send shivers down my spine
02:21:37 a b p c p h q was already founded
02:21:39 how many ones for munchie would I
02:21:41 have to retroactively press
02:21:43 so I innocently clicked on the pcp youtube channel
02:21:45 not knowing what would await me
02:21:55 I cried and screamed so blood curdling loud
02:21:57 that I lost my voice permanently
02:21:59 my dreams were shattered and I shot my pants
02:22:01 and I had an orgasm
02:22:03 in three weeks
02:22:05 I am utterly defeated and will never recover
02:22:09 same
02:22:11 give his best girl
02:22:19 why did you come back
02:22:21 why did you ruin it for yourself
02:22:23 you should never
02:22:25 you should never have looked
02:22:27 you should have just let yourself be content
02:22:29 with the fantasy
02:22:31 not knowing
02:22:33 it's like the typical story when god said not to look back
02:22:35 and then someone did
02:22:37 you look back and you've become the pillar
02:22:39 you've become the pillar of salt
02:22:41 it's you
02:22:43 that's so sad
02:22:45 what was that, that was a greek myth about that
02:22:47 it was a fucking
02:22:49 no it was Sodom and Gomorrah
02:22:51 that was also a greek myth
02:22:53 where your wife died
02:22:55 and you can't look at her face
02:22:57 oh yeah
02:22:59 she's forever
02:23:01 never coming back
02:23:03 I can't remember the name
02:23:05 was it Persephone
02:23:07 Persephone in the underworld right
02:23:09 yeah something like that
02:23:11 that's the one that Pluto
02:23:13 said because she ate the pomegranate
02:23:15 so she has to be
02:23:17 she has to be in the underworld
02:23:19 half the time
02:23:21 I don't know if that's the same one
02:23:23 I think it might be a different one
02:23:25 yeah
02:23:27 I've heard the one you're talking about
02:23:29 yeah
02:23:31 he goes to the underworld to get his wife back
02:23:33 and you can't look at her
02:23:35 what he does
02:23:37 like a fool, like an idiot
02:23:39 which is basically the same
02:23:41 as the story of Lot
02:23:43 it's Lot
02:23:45 it's either Sodom or Gomorrah
02:23:47 and his wife
02:23:49 he's the only good man
02:23:51 in the city
02:23:53 and he has to flee
02:23:55 and he takes his family with him
02:23:57 and his wife
02:23:59 and God says don't look back
02:24:01 but his wife looks back and turns into a pillar of salt
02:24:03 so he escapes with his daughters
02:24:05 but it's okay because he just fucks his daughters
02:24:07 instead of his wife
02:24:09 and starts a new family with them
02:24:11 so it's all good
02:24:13 he's the only good man
02:24:15 well I mean what choice do they have Tom
02:24:17 you know
02:24:19 God turned everyone else to salt
02:24:21 what would you have done
02:24:23 God's kind of an asshole
02:24:25 I mean
02:24:27 he
02:24:29 he knew what he was doing
02:24:31 he knew what he was fucking doing
02:24:33 so I'm saying
