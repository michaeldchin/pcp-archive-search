00:00:00 Welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast, it's morning in America and it's afternoon in Japan
00:00:24 where Gibb is reporting live from Japan, he should send breakfast in America because that's an album by the, what's it called, Super Tramp, are they a British band?
00:00:42 Half British, half Australian, I believe, they're members. I really like Super Tramp. Yes. I love Super Tramp. Good reference, one time in my old house, like two houses ago, me and a guy just got really drunk and just were like, oh my god, you like Super Tramp, I like Super Tramp.
00:01:11 When I was young, life was so wonderful. The miracle was beautiful, magical. Yeah, I remember. I remember when things happen sometimes. How's your week been, Gibb?
00:01:32 My week, gee, I don't know, it's a blur. Oh, I beat Outer Wilds, that's the thing. I talked about it last time, but I beat it.
00:01:43 You beat what now?
00:01:45 Outer Wilds, remember the game, the space game?
00:01:48 Oh yeah, I downloaded it, but I haven't played it yet.
00:01:52 Give it a go, give it a good old try.
00:01:57 It's on my desktop, so yeah, I should. I just haven't gotten around to it.
00:02:05 I'm halfway through editing, finishing to edit my video, like the final cut.
00:02:15 I had to do the whole rough cut, and now I'm going through the fine tooth comb, like doing the final edit of it, and that is half done.
00:02:24 I have three and a half hours out of probably seven and a half hours, so that's what I've been doing this week.
00:02:32 Oh, you mean you've gone through three hours? I thought you'd cut it down from seven to three somehow?
00:02:36 No, no, I have edited three and a half hours of it, and there is about three and a half hours, probably four hours left to go.
00:02:50 Crazy.
00:02:52 Two weeks ago I said maybe I'd have it done by the time the episode dropped, lol, that was silly, that was too optimistic, but I said as much.
00:03:05 Progress is progress.
00:03:09 Yeah, hey yeah, it is.
00:03:15 Hell yeah.
00:03:17 I made a bit of progress on the Clarissa, I'm now in the final scene kind of, the showdown.
00:03:26 I'm at the showdown.
00:03:28 Of the sketches?
00:03:29 Of the blocking out of the pages.
00:03:32 They're sort of half sketches, I'm deciding where the characters are standing and what poses they have, and I might change that before I properly sketch them.
00:03:41 Like a storyboard almost.
00:03:44 Yeah.
00:03:45 Yeah, I gotcha, I gotcha.
00:03:49 Cool, how many pages is it at?
00:03:53 Oh, I knew this, I counted them, I think right now.
00:03:58 Yeah, the most obvious question, you gotta know this one's coming.
00:04:03 I think it's like 80 something pages that have been blocked out and need to be sketched, so 80 something pages currently and will include more by the end.
00:04:19 And there's 50 that are already out, you can read right now on gippentake.site.
00:04:26 Clarissa Gunsmoke and the Bandit King, I forget the exact URL.
00:04:32 Just go to gippentake.site and read my comic.
00:04:37 Yes, indeed, indeed.
00:04:44 But yeah, it's like I'm not technically getting that much done, but I am always getting something done, so it's coming along.
00:04:54 I don't know whether I'll be finishing things up by the end of October.
00:05:00 I hope to at least be in the sketching phase and then see how many pages I can get done.
00:05:09 And then at some point this will happen, the progress is slow but steady.
00:05:17 It'd be nice if it was first, but I can't have everything.
00:05:24 No indeed, no indeed.
00:05:29 True words were never spoken.
00:05:40 When's it gonna be done?
00:05:42 Huh?
00:05:43 When's it gonna be done?
00:05:44 When's it gonna be done?
00:05:45 Give me deadline right now.
00:05:47 No, no, no, no, no.
00:05:49 Before the end of the year, because I don't think I have anything coming up that will distract.
00:05:58 So as long as I keep the work in every day, every weekday, and I do a certain amount of stuff, couple hours a day at the very least, yeah, I can get it done.
00:06:16 Christmas is always a big busy time, but November isn't.
00:06:20 November's fine.
00:06:25 I'm feeling a little bit, I don't want to be a Grinch, I don't want to be a Halloween Grinch, but I'm feeling a little bit anti-Halloween this year.
00:06:38 I'm feeling a little bit fed up with all the spooky season pumpkin posting.
00:06:45 It's the second and I'm already a little bit sick of it, if I'm being completely honest.
00:06:52 The spooky posting is just sort of like whatever, but I like Halloween.
00:06:59 Every year, every year, the noise, noise, noise, noise, they just keep posting and posting.
00:07:08 You're gonna go around in a devil costume and steal all the candy so they can't trick or treat.
00:07:16 It'll only be tricks.
00:07:20 I'm gonna go around dressed as a Mormon saying, I don't let my kids celebrate Halloween and I won't let you seduce him.
00:07:31 I won't let you groom him into Halloween-ing with you.
00:07:38 I don't get it. I don't really like it very much.
00:07:49 The aesthetic is not that appealing. I guess it's fine because it's different.
00:07:54 I feel like it didn't used to be the whole month of October.
00:07:59 Back in my day, I don't remember.
00:08:04 I mean, the sheer Halloween decorations start going up.
00:08:08 I don't know.
00:08:10 I have a similar feeling in that-
00:08:13 I like spending Halloween with friends. It is a fun holiday, but that's about it.
00:08:21 That's as strong as I feel about it.
00:08:23 It's like the Halloween posts feel obligatory by a lot of people.
00:08:30 It's mostly just tweets where I'm like, oh, spooky.
00:08:33 Here's a gif. I'm like, yeah, I've seen that before.
00:08:37 Everybody's got their own little thing doing.
00:08:40 I think they're just sort of excited and that's fine.
00:08:43 The posts aren't what I'm interested in.
00:08:45 I like the stuff that happens on October because you're guaranteed your favorite content creator is gonna have a Halloween special.
00:08:54 They're all gonna do it.
00:08:58 That's quite fun.
00:09:00 Yeah, okay. That's fair. That's true.
00:09:04 I never used to. I never used to dress up.
00:09:09 I dressed up when I was younger and I was a little kid for Halloween and stuff,
00:09:14 but when I got into my teenage years, I was like,
00:09:17 what am I gonna do wearing a garbage bag as a cape and a little hat?
00:09:23 I don't need to do that.
00:09:25 So I didn't and I'm like, that's a garbage bag and a little hat.
00:09:29 That's your costume. That's your idea of a Halloween costume.
00:09:32 Yeah, I didn't give a fuck.
00:09:35 Hey, what are you this year, kid?
00:09:39 I was just wearing this garbage bag and a little hat.
00:09:46 You mean it's Halloween?
00:09:49 Yeah.
00:09:53 But I want to get back into that.
00:09:55 I want to actually make a Halloween costume this year.
00:09:59 I want to try and make something or half make it and half buy some stuff at thrift stores and put together an outfit
00:10:08 instead of just relying on store bought masks that we got 19 years ago that are in the Halloween box.
00:10:18 Because that's what I used to be.
00:10:20 If I don't put any effort in, all I've got is the Halloween box and the Halloween box is really old and sucks.
00:10:27 I used to always try and make it an opportunity to do what I guess I would later come to know as cosplay.
00:10:35 I always used to want to, for Halloween, I always used to be a video game character.
00:10:40 It's a little lame to cosplay on Halloween. It's not spooky.
00:10:46 I feel like it's worth something. If you're going to do it, you should be on brand with it.
00:10:53 I suppose so, yeah.
00:10:55 It's not an anime convention.
00:10:57 That's what I would tell my young self if I could go back and do it all over again.
00:11:04 Yeah, I mean little babies.
00:11:07 Little babies are allowed to be like a minion or something.
00:11:13 Well, if you're scared of scary stuff, you can be like a little Captain America or whatever.
00:11:19 Well, everyone, who did I see saying like, fuck, everyone is going to be the Queen's corpse this year?
00:11:28 Everyone is going to be zombie.
00:11:32 Shit, was the Queen named Victoria?
00:11:34 It's Elizabeth.
00:11:36 Elizabeth, sorry, everyone's going to be the zombie Queen Elizabeth.
00:11:40 You know, I hadn't even considered that, but that is kind of an obvious edgy joke costume.
00:11:48 Do you remember the year that the Dark Knight came out and everybody was fucking the Joker?
00:11:54 They were fucking the Joker?
00:11:56 They were fucking the Joker, Jerry.
00:11:58 Oh my god, yeah, he got so much sex.
00:12:00 They fucked him. He got so much puse.
00:12:02 No, everybody was Heath Ledger's Joker.
00:12:08 It's going to be that with the zombie Queen Elizabeth.
00:12:12 The new hit blockbuster was the Queen's funeral because there's nothing else in the cinema.
00:12:20 That's how it feels.
00:12:22 Basically, I want to make a thing. I just haven't decided.
00:12:32 I made a tweet just now, just today.
00:12:34 I'm like, what am I going to be? What do I do?
00:12:38 Because I don't know. I could be Friska, but she just wears a jacket.
00:12:42 She's not scary except when she's trying to kill people.
00:12:46 What am I going to do?
00:12:48 Yeah, blah, blah.
00:12:50 I feel like, I don't know, I think that'd be funny.
00:12:52 I know I just said Cosplaying on Halloween is wrong.
00:12:56 I don't actually think it's wrong. I just think it was lame when I did it.
00:13:02 I would tell myself not to do it, but I hold myself to a different standard.
00:13:08 Because I did it enough.
00:13:10 I did it enough.
00:13:12 Were you Mega Man X?
00:13:14 No, I was Link from Zelda one year.
00:13:18 I was Squall from Final Fantasy VIII in eighth grade.
00:13:24 I don't know. It's so stupid, pitiful, pathetic. Die.
00:13:30 Do you have pictures? Do you have pictures we can put on the screen of Ben St. as Squall?
00:13:36 No. I mean, maybe my parents have some pictures of it. I hope not.
00:13:42 I hope not.
00:13:46 I don't know. Looking back, it's sad because I used to think it would be cool.
00:13:58 I used to want to cosplay as Zero from Mega Man Zero.
00:14:02 I was like, damn, I want to dress like that. I want to have a costume like that.
00:14:04 Oh, with the long blond, like, spiky hair thing?
00:14:08 Yes, but specifically the one from the Zero series, which looks distinct from Zero in the rest of the series.
00:14:16 He had a different artist.
00:14:22 This is the case for Zero as well as for everyone else.
00:14:26 You can't just dress like that.
00:14:30 Or, in fact, basically anything that I wanted to dress like.
00:14:34 You can't just dress like that and look fine because you don't have that body type.
00:14:40 You don't actually look like that.
00:14:42 If I tried to dress like Mega Man Zero...
00:14:46 Sorry, his name's not Mega Man Zero. His name's just Zero.
00:14:50 I don't know. I would just look like a fat weirdo.
00:14:54 He has a very twinkish body type.
00:14:58 Despite how much I appreciate the character, I simply could not pull it off.
00:15:04 Same with Squall.
00:15:08 It's not really made much of in the game, but Squall is a very tall, handsome, lantern-jawed, slim-build sort of guy.
00:15:20 I was like a dumpy kid.
00:15:24 I'm sure it just looked miserable.
00:15:28 It's hard to look good when you're being a character that doesn't exist.
00:15:34 Isn't it fun, though?
00:15:38 To dress up?
00:15:40 I did have fun, but I shouldn't have. That was my mistake.
00:15:44 That was wrong of me and I apologize.
00:15:48 I didn't have the school bullies to laugh at you directly.
00:15:52 It's such an obvious way to make you aware that you didn't look perfect.
00:15:56 Nobody laughed at me.
00:15:58 In fact, even one of the kids who I wouldn't have called him a bully.
00:16:02 I didn't really have bullies in school, but there was a kid from a clique that I considered to be more diametrically opposed.
00:16:11 A kid I thought wouldn't like me, but I got a compliment.
00:16:15 I was like, oh, that's a good game. I liked that game Final Fantasy VIII.
00:16:19 I was like, oh, what? Oh, cool.
00:16:21 It sounds like it was a good idea and it was fine, Benz scene.
00:16:25 It sounds like it was not embarrassing at all.
00:16:28 But let me tell you, it was embarrassing for internal reasons.
00:16:34 I embarrassed myself to myself.
00:16:38 I'm not worried about anyone else's opinion.
00:16:42 I don't care what anyone else thinks. I only care what my extremely self-critical version of myself thinks.
00:16:47 Yeah, man, I'm a rebel. I don't care what anyone else thinks except the voice in my head that tells me what a loser I am, that one.
00:16:54 I'm very concerned about it. Let me shape my whole life around it.
00:16:59 Man, dad.
00:17:04 Yep, I'm a renegade.
00:17:08 I could do like a steampunk, goth, vampire, queen sort of thing.
00:17:14 Just trying to think of like the classic.
00:17:18 I was thinking of like being like a character, but I don't know.
00:17:23 I don't know whether I want to be a reference to something.
00:17:29 Because it's easy if you're a reference to something. You just reference the image or the character design.
00:17:35 And you can like, you know, steal their look and get all the things.
00:17:40 But that feels too easy.
00:17:45 But then again, I might not have the patience to do a lot of work on it.
00:17:53 So I might take the easy approach and just like get some like red boots and goes Marcelline or something.
00:18:02 I can play bass. It works.
00:18:06 True. Yeah.
00:18:10 Damn, I didn't even think about even think about costuming.
00:18:14 I just assumed I wouldn't do it.
00:18:17 Maybe I could do something.
00:18:20 Maybe you could be the Professor Brothers or whatever those guys are called.
00:18:24 No, would anybody, would anybody get that?
00:18:28 I mean, you've referenced it before. I don't even remember what they're about.
00:18:32 Yeah. I mean, would anyone outside of the podcast get it?
00:18:36 Even people who listen to the, first of all, people can't see me on the podcast.
00:18:41 Yeah. We're not going to dress up for, we might.
00:18:44 I mean, it depends on when we're recording the one near Halloween.
00:18:48 Bonus episode idea. Episode recorded in Halloween costume.
00:18:52 But you can't see us.
00:18:54 But every so often, if we're wearing a crinkly outfit, we'll crinkle.
00:18:58 We'll crinkle for you.
00:19:00 And you'll know. It'll change the whole vibe.
00:19:02 We'll change.
00:19:06 I am not sure if I will do a costume or if I did, like what would I wear it to?
00:19:12 I'm not sure. I haven't worked all that out yet.
00:19:18 But I'm not completely sure. I'm not, I'm not saying I definitely won't.
00:19:24 But I won't if I don't have any good reason to.
00:19:27 Sure. I mean, I'm not really going to go out to a party wearing it.
00:19:32 I don't have any parties planned.
00:19:34 Maybe I'll find something.
00:19:36 I just want to like do it to do it and then take some pictures.
00:19:40 And then I can wear it during Halloween.
00:19:44 And then I might just, if I make something cool that I can just wear normally.
00:19:49 That'd be cool.
00:19:51 And I can just wear forever.
00:19:55 Why only do Halloween on Halloween?
00:19:58 You know, you know, actually, oh man, I had a
00:20:01 realization on the subject of costumes.
00:20:04 I have started, okay, because I've lost, I've lost a bunch of weight.
00:20:09 I'm down to like 160 pounds, which for my height is,
00:20:13 which for my height actually puts me BMI wise,
00:20:17 it puts me just under the line of being overweight.
00:20:21 So I'm just barely no longer overweight according to BMI.
00:20:25 I guess so.
00:20:27 This is, I feel like, like it just, it feels hard for me to get to this weight.
00:20:33 It doesn't, like I'm usually, but I am now.
00:20:35 So anyway, what I'm saying is that I feel like BMI underestimates how much I should weigh.
00:20:40 But that's a different subject anyway.
00:20:44 I have lost a bunch of weight.
00:20:46 And so I now fit into a bunch of clothes that I have not been able to wear for a while again.
00:20:51 I fit into a bunch of shirts that I used to really like.
00:20:55 I wore one the other day, a button down.
00:20:57 It felt good.
00:20:58 I thought I looked good in it.
00:21:00 But I was wearing the jacket, the same jacket that I wore in the Radcon 4 lectures.
00:21:09 It's like a black tuxedo jacket, sort of.
00:21:12 It doesn't have tails in the back, but it's sort of like,
00:21:16 it's sort of a tuxedo jacket.
00:21:18 But it's like, I don't know what you'd call it.
00:21:21 It's like a short, sort of like half jacket.
00:21:25 It's like, doesn't reach all the way down to my waist.
00:21:29 Yeah, I guess so.
00:21:32 It's like a tuxedo crop jacket.
00:21:34 And I think it's so cool.
00:21:36 And I wish I had more of them.
00:21:38 I was looking for like similar things on like Amazon or eBay.
00:21:43 And I couldn't really find that many.
00:21:44 Almost all the things I did find were women's.
00:21:47 Which is like, well, I mean, I would wear a women's, I would wear a women's jacket if like,
00:21:52 as long as it didn't look like super girly or anything.
00:21:56 But most of the ones I found were, they either looked girly
00:22:01 or they were like really expensive.
00:22:03 So that was kind of a bummer.
00:22:04 There weren't that many.
00:22:06 But I was looking at the tag of it to see if I could find any information about the manufacturer.
00:22:10 And it was like, it's like a costume jacket.
00:22:13 It's made for by like a costume company.
00:22:15 Not like a regular clothing company.
00:22:18 I was like, huh, okay, sure, whatever.
00:22:22 I guess I'm not supposed to wear this in quote unquote real life.
00:22:26 Yeah, that's a bunch of hooey.
00:22:30 It is a bunch of hooey.
00:22:31 Thank you.
00:22:32 Thank you.
00:22:33 That's what I've been saying.
00:22:41 I think partly I just want to, I want to try doing something like a little ostentatious,
00:22:49 a little out there, a little extreme.
00:22:52 For me, in a way that I can like get used to, I don't know, wearing more wilder things in normal day to day.
00:23:02 Because I tend to like chicken out still and wear a t-shirt and whatever, like jeans.
00:23:11 I'm like, that's fine, I guess.
00:23:14 It's clothing.
00:23:15 But like, I can wear other things.
00:23:18 I can wear more or better things.
00:23:20 What if I did that more?
00:23:23 What if that was, I don't know, then I had to explain it.
00:23:27 I am not, you're saying you're saying you want to wear something outlandish and attention-grabbing.
00:23:33 On Halloween.
00:23:34 As an exercise.
00:23:36 As a practice.
00:23:37 Because you're allowed to and it just sort of would make it easier to like, I don't know.
00:23:43 I'm embarrassed.
00:23:45 I'm embarrassed about like, wearing things that are more feminine.
00:23:51 And I don't know.
00:23:53 I want to get better at it because I do like it when I try.
00:24:00 I mean, you can wear whatever you want on Halloween.
00:24:05 So you can truly go wild.
00:24:07 Nobody's going to say shit.
00:24:10 Yeah.
00:24:11 Yeah.
00:24:16 Okay.
00:24:17 So where are we going from here?
00:24:22 I don't know.
00:24:24 That was really my only thought.
00:24:26 So it's just like, I want to do a Halloween thing.
00:24:29 And that's my mind is set on that for the moment.
00:24:32 That's all I'm thinking about.
00:24:34 I'm going to obviously work on the Clarissa, but I don't know what October will bring.
00:24:39 And it will just probably be a month.
00:24:43 And that's, that's how it usually goes.
00:24:47 I feel pretty confident that my for this October, I will, I will finish editing my big video probably in the next week.
00:24:57 And I really mean it this time.
00:24:59 And then maybe I will get it posted in the same week.
00:25:05 Although you never know.
00:25:06 Sometimes things can happen.
00:25:07 Like if there's always the chance that I try to upload it, but like it gets flagged.
00:25:11 And then I have to like do some fuckery with it to get around copyright stuff or content flags or something.
00:25:19 Or there's the chance that like the rendering might prove problematic because it's such a big video.
00:25:23 And sometimes rendering really big videos can be a real fucky-wucky.
00:25:28 So I'll probably get that done in like the next week.
00:25:31 So my October will probably be, I'll probably, I guess I'll, once that's done, I'll be going back to finish up Slime and Punishment and getting that the book version of it done and hopefully produced.
00:25:45 I was thinking about, I was thinking about what I was going to do for the Kickstarter trailer for Slime and Punishment.
00:25:51 And I have a green screen.
00:25:55 And I was thinking, I wonder if I could do some kind of, I wonder if I could do some kind of like in character green screen like from New Los Angeles City as the cop killer sort of little message.
00:26:13 I think that would be cool.
00:26:14 I think that could look pretty cool.
00:26:17 Hmm.
00:26:18 Yeah.
00:26:19 Use a little filter.
00:26:20 How would you a green screen if you're, are you going to have your green like mask, the one that has your teeth on it?
00:26:29 Wait, what do you mean?
00:26:30 Don't you have like a mask, like a little fabric thing that you can pull up over your face that has like your gross slime teeth?
00:26:38 Oh, sure.
00:26:39 Well, I wouldn't wear that.
00:26:40 I mean, that would cover my, my real face.
00:26:43 No, we just use a fricking, just use fricking color shift video elements.
00:26:50 Just, just make myself purple, crunch up the contrast, add some filters.
00:26:57 Maybe I could get it so that my teeth look green.
00:27:00 Anyway, you know, that would be pretty cool.
00:27:02 Yeah.
00:27:04 I don't know.
00:27:05 I guess we'll see.
00:27:07 I just, I thought that would be a, I thought that would be a fun way to approach it.
00:27:10 It might, might be cool.
00:27:11 I don't know.
00:27:14 Oh, um, speaking of kick starters, um, the clown, the clown milk Kickstarter.
00:27:20 She, do you see that?
00:27:21 She's his clown milk.
00:27:22 Yeah.
00:27:23 Kickstarter.
00:27:24 He met, he mentioned it.
00:27:25 It is, it is, it is, it is sluggish.
00:27:28 It's going sluggishly.
00:27:29 It is not on track to hit its funding goal.
00:27:32 I hope it, I hope it comes from behind and hits it.
00:27:35 I pledge five bucks.
00:27:37 It does seem to be that it always ramps up near the end.
00:27:41 So I can, we can hope.
00:27:43 That does, that, that does.
00:27:45 It's got to, it's got to be like a big marketing push closer to the, the end of it.
00:27:50 I hope he, yeah, I hope he's able to like maybe do a podcast appearance or two or something
00:27:56 or something to, uh, yeah, get eyes on it.
00:27:59 I think it's at like a little under two K now of it's like 16 K goal.
00:28:06 You know, I wasn't, I had no idea like what's like what the market is like for clown porn.
00:28:11 Like for all I know, it could be like a very untapped market and there's a, and there would
00:28:16 be like a ground swell of like support for it.
00:28:21 It's, it's weird.
00:28:22 I feel like clown, like sexy clown women as an idea has become more popular more recently.
00:28:31 I don't know.
00:28:32 You know, I feel that way, but it might just be because I know cheesy.
00:28:37 It might be, but I don't know.
00:28:41 Like there's like Twitter users that dress up in clown makeup and they do like the Hong Kong sex.
00:28:47 Like it's a, it's a.
00:28:48 I have seen a couple of them, but I see them because cheesy follows them and cheesy retweets
00:28:53 them sometimes.
00:28:54 So that's why I'm like, is it, is it really becoming popular or am I just, have I just
00:28:58 been exposed to some more, more of it than none?
00:29:02 Well, I mean, I look at the, the likes and I'm like, these aren't like niche accounts.
00:29:07 They're quite big, like reasonably big.
00:29:10 I mean, I think, I think that they're more popular, but I don't know how popular in general.
00:29:18 Yeah.
00:29:19 Yeah.
00:29:20 I think, I think like 10 years ago, the idea would have been like, like people were talking
00:29:25 about how clowns are creepy, like that was the thing.
00:29:28 Nobody was talking about how clowns were sexy.
00:29:31 There's, yeah, there's one, um, there's one, I think she's a Twitch streamer or like an
00:29:37 Instagram girl.
00:29:38 She's called, I think she's called bouncy clown.
00:29:41 Uh, she's cute, but, but her bio is like, her bio says like cute clown, not scary clown.
00:29:48 Yeah.
00:29:49 Yeah.
00:29:50 No, I think, no, I think you're right.
00:29:52 I feel like there's been a little bit of like, hey, maybe clowns are all right sometimes.
00:29:57 I think it's just like a general sense of like people embracing like grossness.
00:30:02 I think the pendulum has swung a little bit the other way on clowns.
00:30:04 I feel similarly.
00:30:06 Yeah.
00:30:07 People in general, I think are like embracing grossness as like a comedy thing, like going
00:30:11 goblin mode and being like a horrible thing.
00:30:14 So like clowns used to be scary, but now they're sexy is like, could be a part of that.
00:30:21 Hmm.
00:30:22 Oh, monster girls, but girls will, they will just kill you like a stab you in the face.
00:30:28 Somebody do that so hot.
00:30:30 Somebody needs to write a video essay on, you know, the, the semiotics of the, the intersection
00:30:36 between clowns and got clowns and pop culture and goblin mode and what it means for society.
00:30:42 Um, man, oh man.
00:30:47 So anyway, uh, I've been, I've been, I've been keeping my eye on that, but reminder to
00:30:52 any viewers that haven't, they should check out the clown milk Kickstarter if they're,
00:30:57 if they want to see that succeed.
00:31:01 Yes.
00:31:03 Uh, what else?
00:31:04 What else?
00:31:05 I didn't, I don't have any notes.
00:31:06 I didn't write any notes for this, um, for this, this week.
00:31:11 Yeah.
00:31:12 It's sort of been a weird week.
00:31:14 And by weird, I mean normal.
00:31:16 I'm just like, I have a good day and I get some work done.
00:31:19 Then I have a bad day and it's sad.
00:31:21 Then I'm okay.
00:31:23 The week's over.
00:31:25 I got some work done.
00:31:26 Well, that's good.
00:31:27 Okay.
00:31:28 New, new month.
00:31:29 Oh, I've got to do my money spenders podcast.
00:31:32 I kind of forgot that.
00:31:33 I have, you know, I recorded a, I did record a, a patron, uh, thing a few weeks ago.
00:31:41 I said in that, that like, I don't think, I called the monthly Q and A's, but I haven't
00:31:47 been doing the monthly for a while.
00:31:48 And I think it's time to acknowledge that like, I'm not going to do them monthly.
00:31:51 They're probably going to be more like every couple of months.
00:31:54 And I think I'm, I think I'm okay with that because, you know, I have this podcast to
00:31:59 say everything that happens to me on a somewhat regular basis that the patron one is for, um,
00:32:08 I don't know, uh, opining about more things, more generally the direction my life is heading,
00:32:15 I guess.
00:32:16 So a more zoomed out view is, is okay.
00:32:19 I think.
00:32:20 Yeah.
00:32:21 That's the same with mine.
00:32:23 It's, it's more personal, more things I don't want to be said publicly, but I'm okay with
00:32:29 saying a little bit.
00:32:31 There isn't, there isn't, there isn't too much.
00:32:36 I guess there's some things that I would not say on the PCP.
00:32:40 There's not that many things though.
00:32:42 It's pretty, it's pretty uncommon for me to have like something that I don't want to
00:32:48 talk about on here.
00:32:50 For me, it's mostly just like trends thoughts.
00:32:53 And I'm like, well, I mean, if I'm talking on a podcast with you, you won't get it.
00:32:58 So it'll sort of be me talking by myself.
00:33:00 So I may as well just be talking by myself on my own podcast about that sort of stuff.
00:33:06 I mean, guilty.
00:33:08 Sorry.
00:33:09 I'm sorry, Gip.
00:33:11 That's fine.
00:33:12 If only you could have just not been CIS, if only.
00:33:17 If only.
00:33:18 Then we could have, then we could have like a friendship, but you know, the moment is
00:33:22 just a purely business relationship.
00:33:24 We got going.
00:33:25 Yeah, it's, yeah, it's too, it's too bad.
00:33:27 You know, it's, it is a shame.
00:33:28 You know, I did always want to be a girl, but unfortunately I'm not, I'm not CIS.
00:33:32 So it just didn't work out that way.
00:33:38 You shook the magic and you asked and I said, yeah.
00:33:43 In another role of history's dice, perhaps.
00:33:49 Speaking of being a girl, another one more page, new turned in one more page.
00:33:55 Yes, I saw this week.
00:33:57 It's slowed down a little bit.
00:34:00 I haven't, I haven't heard from Simsie about his page in a while.
00:34:03 I think he, I think he might have like, I think he might have like taken a hiatus from drawing.
00:34:09 I might ask him again about it.
00:34:11 And if he like, I might just like finish up the sketch that he did for him rather than
00:34:15 like find someone to do that.
00:34:18 And then maybe I'll just do the rest.
00:34:19 I might just do the rest of that page myself, even though I had a hard line stance against.
00:34:24 I mean, it's worth reaching out for sure.
00:34:26 I did ask, I did ask him about it again, but that was several weeks ago at this point.
00:34:31 So yeah, maybe one more, maybe one more try.
00:34:34 And then I'm like, oh, well, oh, well, he seems, he seems like he's,
00:34:40 he seems like he's not feeling it on Twitter recently.
00:34:44 So I think maybe he's, maybe he's not wanting to do it at the moment, which is fine.
00:34:52 We love that boy.
00:34:54 We miss that boy.
00:34:55 Love that boy.
00:34:56 Miss that boy.
00:34:57 Precious.
00:34:58 Precious Simsie.
00:35:02 Come back to us.
00:35:04 No, it's fine.
00:35:09 The dojin though.
00:35:10 Yeah.
00:35:11 There's only what, like maybe five pages left or something like that.
00:35:14 And then it's, there's no cover.
00:35:17 Still don't have a cover.
00:35:19 There was a, there was, there was a guy, that guy who worked on Scott Pilgrim that I wanted to ask if he'd draw the cover.
00:35:25 And I have, he was a little bit, at first he was busy and then he was like, sorry, I've been busy.
00:35:34 Let me get back to you about it.
00:35:35 And I was like, okay.
00:35:36 And then he didn't get back to me.
00:35:37 So I might give up on that too.
00:35:39 Hmm.
00:35:40 I think, I think Kaiji might have wanted to draw the cover.
00:35:44 Oh yeah.
00:35:45 Yeah.
00:35:47 And I didn't know anything to say.
00:35:49 What, huh?
00:35:50 Is there a lag?
00:35:51 Is there a lag that is like closing conversational difficulties?
00:35:54 No.
00:35:55 Is there?
00:35:56 Can you hear me?
00:35:57 Right now?
00:35:58 I can hear you.
00:35:59 Yeah.
00:36:00 I just don't know when you're hearing me.
00:36:01 I think we're fine.
00:36:02 No, I think, no, I think we're good.
00:36:04 Hmm.
00:36:05 Oh, this disease, I don't have, I don't have that much to talk about.
00:36:11 I can talk about.
00:36:13 Do you want to hear, do you want to, oh yeah, yeah.
00:36:15 Something.
00:36:16 The Last of Us part two.
00:36:17 You played that game?
00:36:19 No.
00:36:21 I remember hearing all sorts of bad things about it when it came out.
00:36:25 And my brother's been playing it and I've been watching him.
00:36:28 And it's good.
00:36:30 It's actually very good.
00:36:32 I like what they're doing.
00:36:34 I have seen video essays talking about it.
00:36:38 Because I didn't play the first one and I didn't plan to.
00:36:41 And I wasn't going to play the second one.
00:36:43 But I have heard people talk about it.
00:36:44 And a bunch of the video essay people that I follow have said that the game got a lot
00:36:50 of backlash when it came out.
00:36:53 But actually it's kind of good.
00:36:55 Yeah.
00:36:56 Although the story is maybe a little bit confused, maybe not confused, but like all over the
00:37:01 place.
00:37:02 And like thematically it's a little bit like, hmm, what exactly were they going for?
00:37:05 But like there is a, there are themes there.
00:37:08 Is my impression.
00:37:09 I would say it's a lot more cohesive and people are giving it credit.
00:37:12 I don't know why.
00:37:13 Like I've heard that as well.
00:37:15 They think it's disjointed.
00:37:16 It's very simple.
00:37:17 Well, it sounds like people are split on the ending.
00:37:22 And I guess it's like, I guess like half of the game you play as the person that kills
00:37:28 Joel.
00:37:29 Yeah.
00:37:30 And then you have to sort of play as them and sort of see like what their deal is.
00:37:35 Which is a, which is a, which is a, I think that's a fair and reasonable thing to do in
00:37:41 the, in the story, but I can definitely see how it's off-putting.
00:37:45 If you like Joel and then the game is like now understand why the person that murdered
00:37:50 Joel kind of was, was, was a justified or not justified, but like, you know, why they,
00:37:57 they had their reasons come to play as them and understand them as their own person.
00:38:02 See, that's the, the service is challenging.
00:38:04 It's a, it's a challenging decision.
00:38:06 That's surface level though.
00:38:08 I feel like having, having seen the game play out in real time with the cutscenes happening
00:38:14 when they do, it's not about just like the, the, the frustration of playing as Joel's killer.
00:38:23 It's like more of a, a broader theme about like the, the necessariness of revenge and
00:38:30 how it's like self-defeating.
00:38:32 Cause the whole Abbey, right?
00:38:34 She is the person who kills Joel.
00:38:37 Her dad was a guy who Joel killed at the end of the first game and he was a very important
00:38:43 guy.
00:38:44 He was going to save the world with a vaccine and Joel killed him because the vaccine would
00:38:48 have killed Ellie.
00:38:49 Well, that's like, that's the, I mean, I've heard, I've heard, I've heard some people
00:38:56 question whether that vaccine would have actually like worked.
00:39:00 Sure.
00:39:01 I mean, yeah.
00:39:02 But in theory, they were going to try it.
00:39:04 They were doing that.
00:39:05 Yeah.
00:39:06 But the thing is that was Abbey's dad.
00:39:08 Abbey obviously hates Joel and is dead set on finding Joel and killing him.
00:39:14 What the fuck?
00:39:15 And so why is it a Libyan?
00:39:17 Is that a Libyan fall?
00:39:18 A Libyan fall.
00:39:19 Yo.
00:39:20 We already started recording.
00:39:21 I'm recording.
00:39:22 Okay.
00:39:23 Hey, good to see you.
00:39:25 You have a surprise pop in.
00:39:28 Well, I was going to be recording a draw cast right now, but I couldn't find people.
00:39:33 So I said, fuck it.
00:39:34 I'll do something else.
00:39:35 I see.
00:39:36 Cool.
00:39:37 Okay.
00:39:38 Now this is what we're doing, I guess.
00:39:42 So last was part two spoilers, by the way.
00:39:48 Have you not seen the game?
00:39:50 I don't know.
00:39:52 You don't know.
00:39:54 You don't know.
00:39:56 It's not the kind of game I'm ever going to play in my life.
00:39:59 So I don't care.
00:40:00 Yeah.
00:40:01 That's me.
00:40:02 Like I've been spoiled on it because like I was never going to play it.
00:40:04 The last was part one.
00:40:06 So, okay.
00:40:07 So the thing with Abby is that her desire to kill Joel for revenge of her father and
00:40:14 the rest of the fireflies that he killed kind of fucks up her own life because the one,
00:40:21 the, her boyfriend that she was seeing ends up with some other woman who is one of the
00:40:28 women in the game that Ellie ends up killing.
00:40:34 Her life, her boyfriend is sort of like, he doesn't like that Abby is constantly all
00:40:41 about killing Joel and this revenge thing and they grow distant because of that.
00:40:46 Abby sort of grows distant from her friend group and sort of finds like her life has
00:40:52 less meaning.
00:40:54 And after, you know, she kills Joel, she comes back and her life is kind of sucked.
00:41:00 It's kind of sucked of like purpose and it's like not good.
00:41:04 It's a bad thing.
00:41:05 So it's framed as Abby's desire for revenge was not good for Abby.
00:41:11 And so in parallel, Ellie goes off to kill Abby because she killed Joel and Ellie has
00:41:20 a similar sort of like lust for revenge.
00:41:22 But then we see through Abby's like situation that it's, it's not a good thing to go for
00:41:28 revenge.
00:41:29 It's a bad thing to do for your own life.
00:41:31 And Ellie's friends and like potential love interest are put in harm's way because of
00:41:36 her lust for this, this, this catharsis of killing Abby to revenge Joel.
00:41:44 She puts her own life in danger.
00:41:46 She fucks herself up and her friends and her, you know, and it's like, that's what the game
00:41:52 is about.
00:41:53 It's about like how revenge is self-defeating.
00:41:57 And it doesn't really do much for like anyone else.
00:42:01 And I was, I was just, I just like it.
00:42:03 I just like it as a, as a theme.
00:42:05 I like how it's portrayed and how it's not, it's not as simple.
00:42:09 Yeah.
00:42:10 It's not as simple and like one note as people I've seen make comments about why like it's
00:42:17 a game where you shoot people and the game tells you that you're a bad person for shooting
00:42:21 people because Ryan, that is not at all what it says.
00:42:25 That's sort of a cliche at this point.
00:42:28 Yeah.
00:42:29 Yeah.
00:42:30 Cause like you obviously shoot people for survival because that's the world you live in.
00:42:35 But it's specifically the revengeful killings that are not necessary for survival or self-defense
00:42:44 that are, you know, sort of bloodlust.
00:42:46 That's the thing that they're having a go at.
00:42:49 Like why'd you feel like Joel doesn't deserve what he got?
00:42:53 And also why does Abby feel like she deserved to do that?
00:42:57 Why does Ellie feel like she deserves to do any of this?
00:43:00 It doesn't, you don't need to do that.
00:43:03 You're just fucking yourself up.
00:43:04 That's the sort of message.
00:43:06 And it's controversial, but like, I like it.
00:43:09 It's, it's well told.
00:43:11 It's a story that I am into.
00:43:13 It's interesting.
00:43:14 And I don't like when people like sum it up in such stupid ways.
00:43:19 Yeah.
00:43:20 They don't have a choice for, there's a woman in the game who isn't
00:43:22 conventionally attractive.
00:43:23 So, you know, it's all terrible.
00:43:25 We have to fucking hate everything.
00:43:28 There are a few people like that.
00:43:30 I don't know how many, but it definitely felt like the first wave of hate was like,
00:43:36 I can't believe that somebody killed Joel and she's an ugly woman.
00:43:40 I know.
00:43:41 I saw this a lot of it.
00:43:43 And it was just so silly.
00:43:46 Is that, Abby's not ugly, is she?
00:43:50 She's like, she's not like, she's kind of like muscular.
00:43:54 She's muscular.
00:43:55 She's like jacked.
00:43:56 That's the problem.
00:43:57 And she's got a normal person face.
00:44:00 It's like, she's not a beauty model.
00:44:02 And it's like, it's like, wow, what normal person, person in a post-apocalypse that
00:44:08 has big muscles for survival.
00:44:10 It makes sense.
00:44:11 It's just sort of like, you know, it's a silly thing to get mad about.
00:44:15 And I know some people got mad specifically about how she looked.
00:44:19 It's just not realistic, though.
00:44:21 You know, like a woman just wouldn't be muscular like that.
00:44:26 It just strains suspension of disbelief, I say, in my mushroom zombie apocalypse.
00:44:32 You know, unrealistic that women would exist at all in a post-apocalypse if you think about it.
00:44:36 Mm-mm.
00:44:37 True.
00:44:38 Yeah, they say the mushroom crowd would have killed them all and then it'd be Lisa instead.
00:44:44 Remember Lisa?
00:44:46 From The Simpsons?
00:44:48 No, from Lisa the Painful.
00:44:51 Oh, yes.
00:44:52 There's not enough women or something.
00:44:54 Wait, wait, Lisa's not even in Lisa the Painful.
00:44:59 She's dead.
00:45:00 She was dead the whole time.
00:45:01 Spoilers.
00:45:02 Why'd you say that?
00:45:04 That had nothing to do with anything.
00:45:06 Wait, I thought you meant...
00:45:08 I was talking about the game.
00:45:09 I was not talking about a character.
00:45:11 Oh, yes.
00:45:12 Right.
00:45:13 It would be Lisa, I understand.
00:45:15 Like it would be the, there's only men scenario.
00:45:18 Yes, you're right.
00:45:19 That's the only apocalypse that I think could ever happen.
00:45:22 It's the most realistic scenario, even though they never explain why that happened.
00:45:31 But that makes it so realistic.
00:45:33 It's the ovaries.
00:45:36 Or...
00:45:37 There was the flash, there was the big flash.
00:45:40 Or the balls that are protecting the flash.
00:45:43 It was the balls, it was the balls for sure.
00:45:47 You get right down to it.
00:45:49 How are you doing, Oblivion?
00:45:51 I'm doing okay.
00:45:54 I'm working on new animations for my Patreon.
00:45:57 I've leveled up my art quite a bit.
00:46:01 You think so?
00:46:02 I think so.
00:46:04 I can...
00:46:06 How so?
00:46:08 How so?
00:46:09 Pixar didn't happen.
00:46:10 I'll send pics.
00:46:12 Justify yourself.
00:46:14 Yeah, I'll just chuck a couple in your DMs.
00:46:19 Why not?
00:46:20 Sorry, audience.
00:46:21 I'm not ready to have these be public yet.
00:46:24 Okay, all right.
00:46:26 They're too saucy.
00:46:30 There's one for you, Ben.
00:46:35 Aside from that,
00:46:37 something's been going on.
00:46:39 Kai is completely recovered from his top speed right now.
00:46:42 That's some good news.
00:46:44 Looks good.
00:46:45 Nice.
00:46:46 That is good.
00:46:47 And...
00:46:48 Yeah.
00:46:49 This looks...
00:46:51 Is this Falia?
00:46:53 Yeah, this is Falia.
00:46:56 I don't know how to describe it,
00:46:58 but the style does look a little bit different.
00:47:01 Well, I learned to shade at all,
00:47:04 which I hadn't done before.
00:47:06 Or at least rendered sweat.
00:47:08 Yeah, the oily, the skin reflection.
00:47:13 Yeah, I can...
00:47:15 It's nice.
00:47:16 You know, maybe I can stand back.
00:47:17 I think it's the Betty Boop lips.
00:47:20 Oh, maybe, yeah.
00:47:22 I think that's what's...
00:47:24 She didn't have lipstick before, did she?
00:47:27 She did sometimes.
00:47:28 It was like every so often.
00:47:30 I think a cropped version that you can put on screen,
00:47:33 Ellie is our...
00:47:36 Also, don't mind the Anatomy being a little personal.
00:47:38 YouTube's mad at us.
00:47:39 YouTube got a little mad at us.
00:47:41 I know.
00:47:42 For that ballpoint pen sketch
00:47:45 of Give as Haruko.
00:47:48 That one time.
00:47:50 Oh, yeah.
00:47:51 You got stuff like that happen.
00:47:54 But, I don't know.
00:47:56 Okay, all right.
00:47:57 Life's going all right.
00:48:00 Are these for an animation?
00:48:02 No, those are just for an image set.
00:48:04 I am doing an animation as well.
00:48:06 Okay.
00:48:07 That is going pretty okay.
00:48:10 Again, maybe I'll need to make a cropped version
00:48:14 of what I'll send you for Ellie's already used.
00:48:18 I think I've seen a whip of this.
00:48:20 I don't know how far beyond, far along it is.
00:48:23 I took a couple weeks off to do some
00:48:28 drawing, basically.
00:48:29 So, it's probably not much further along
00:48:31 than what you saw before.
00:48:34 It is an animation involving my character
00:48:37 moving her funny boobies around.
00:48:40 Her fun bags, you might say.
00:48:42 That is funny.
00:48:44 Oh.
00:48:48 How do you feel about Halloween oblivion?
00:48:51 I think Halloween is a good time sometimes.
00:48:56 I like spooky skeletons.
00:49:00 Somebody has the 10-foot-tall Home Depot skeleton
00:49:05 down the street for me.
00:49:08 It's like leaning off of somebody's third-story balcony.
00:49:12 Oh, my God.
00:49:13 V Home Depot skeleton.
00:49:15 That sounds like there's some lore here.
00:49:17 Well, there's Home Depot cells
00:49:19 like 12-foot-tall skeleton for some reason.
00:49:24 It's crazy.
00:49:26 Yeah.
00:49:27 It's a well-known Halloween artifact
00:49:30 and someone got it.
00:49:33 I don't know, man.
00:49:35 I was saying, I'm not really in the Halloween spirit
00:49:39 at the moment.
00:49:40 I'm not really feeling it right now.
00:49:43 I'll be honest.
00:49:45 I've never done a Halloween.
00:49:48 I've never done a trick-or-treat.
00:49:51 Oh, okay.
00:49:52 That culture just sort of escapes you.
00:49:55 It wasn't really present in New Zealand too much.
00:49:59 Yeah.
00:50:01 Though we did have, the church would,
00:50:04 and churches all over the country would throw
00:50:06 what they called star parties on Halloween.
00:50:10 I've never heard of that.
00:50:13 It sounds like some witchcraft.
00:50:15 It sounds like some astrology.
00:50:17 Yeah, maybe you're correct.
00:50:20 You just come down to a church,
00:50:23 they just have candy out in the open
00:50:25 people can grab.
00:50:26 You can dress up with no scary costumes
00:50:29 and there's a sausage sizzle going on.
00:50:33 Wait, what's a sausage sizzle?
00:50:36 I mean, I think I can guess from the name.
00:50:38 You have a little barbecue and you throw some sausages
00:50:40 and you put them in buns with ketchup
00:50:42 and grilled onions.
00:50:44 You mean a barbecue?
00:50:46 Yeah, you mean a barbecue?
00:50:48 You call it a sausage sizzle.
00:50:50 That's so funny.
00:50:51 Ever go to a Bunnings warehouse?
00:50:53 There's always a person selling $1 sausages outside.
00:50:57 Bunnings?
00:50:58 I mean, I know about Costco $1.50 hot dogs.
00:51:03 And I know about Sheets $0.50 hot dogs.
00:51:07 Damn.
00:51:09 I think they're $0.50.
00:51:10 I've never been to a Sheets.
00:51:12 I just know that Michael from Repstugog
00:51:17 was a big Sheets hot dogs fan.
00:51:19 I think they were $0.50.
00:51:21 Like $2 for a dollar or something.
00:51:23 Anyway, that's beside the point.
00:51:27 Okay, sausage sizzle.
00:51:29 Very funny name for a very specific kind of barbecue.
00:51:33 Yeah.
00:51:34 Look, we didn't really...
00:51:36 You can't bring pork chops to a sausage sizzle.
00:51:40 Get that shit off the grill.
00:51:42 No, it's only sausages and nothing else.
00:51:45 Only sausages.
00:51:46 If it's not encasing...
00:51:49 I like the idea that somebody...
00:51:51 They have the covertly acquired pork chops or whatever,
00:51:56 and they throw them on the grill before anyone can see.
00:51:59 It's like, no!
00:52:01 No!
00:52:02 The pork is gonna ruin...
00:52:04 You don't have plates to eat it on.
00:52:06 You get the...
00:52:08 You have basically like a napkin,
00:52:10 and you get the bun with the sausage in it,
00:52:12 and you just carry the napkin around,
00:52:13 and then you dispose of the napkin when you're done,
00:52:15 or use it to wipe your face or whatever,
00:52:17 and there's no plates or anything.
00:52:19 It's very much like a portable thing
00:52:21 that you can just eat in public.
00:52:23 You don't have to sit down.
00:52:25 Yes, I know what a hot dog is.
00:52:27 I know.
00:52:29 But I see, the point is there's no plates.
00:52:32 We don't call it a barbecue because it's only sausages.
00:52:36 If you were gonna cook other stuff in the backyard,
00:52:39 you would call it a bobby.
00:52:41 In that instance, I guess.
00:52:43 Interesting.
00:52:45 I never heard of that.
00:52:47 But I mean, I get it.
00:52:49 I mean, I've been to a pig roast.
00:52:51 As a kid, as a child,
00:52:53 at my karate dojo,
00:52:55 they had a pig roast one time.
00:52:57 Wow.
00:52:59 Where they roast to the pig.
00:53:01 And the pig never forgave you.
00:53:03 I doubt it.
00:53:05 I doubt he would.
00:53:07 Yeah.
00:53:09 That would be.
00:53:13 I mean, I'm getting hungry.
00:53:15 I'm getting hungry thinking about that.
00:53:17 That's no good.
00:53:19 It's no good.
00:53:21 That's no good.
00:53:23 You know what I could do?
00:53:25 This month, I could explore
00:53:27 my vampire characters that I made.
00:53:29 Did you see this tweet?
00:53:31 Oh, I did see the two vampires.
00:53:33 Yes.
00:53:35 Oh, there they are.
00:53:37 Daki and Makalar.
00:53:39 What's going on with the mouse one?
00:53:41 The mouse one.
00:53:43 Okay.
00:53:45 So you know how a vampire
00:53:47 turns into a bat?
00:53:49 Yeah.
00:53:51 She turns into a mouse instead.
00:53:53 You know?
00:53:55 And so she wants cheese.
00:53:57 I feel like
00:53:59 prior to the
00:54:01 pop culture codification
00:54:03 of what a vampire is
00:54:05 by like Dracula
00:54:07 media,
00:54:09 it wasn't like, oh, vampires turn into bats.
00:54:11 It was like
00:54:13 vampires can do all kinds of crazy things,
00:54:15 including turn into animals.
00:54:17 Yeah.
00:54:19 But then they just had this one famous vampire
00:54:21 that turned into a bat and then suddenly it was like, oh yeah,
00:54:23 vampires turn into bats.
00:54:25 What I wanted when I was coming up with it
00:54:27 was like, I wanted a vampire character,
00:54:29 but I wanted them to be like
00:54:31 not derivative of popular vampires
00:54:33 because vampires exist
00:54:35 in almost every
00:54:37 culture ever
00:54:39 because it's
00:54:41 quite often
00:54:43 misogynistic.
00:54:45 The ones that I got these ones from
00:54:47 were like Indian
00:54:49 and sort of Indonesian myths
00:54:51 where a vampire
00:54:53 is a,
00:54:55 I forget the name
00:54:57 that it was, but like
00:54:59 they seduce men
00:55:01 and they're born
00:55:03 when a woman
00:55:05 has an abortion.
00:55:07 When a woman dies giving birth
00:55:09 or when a woman has an abortion,
00:55:11 they come back as a vampire and they
00:55:13 steal the men away and they kill them
00:55:15 and they turn into beasts
00:55:17 and there's like things like that that are all like
00:55:19 women are scary.
00:55:21 True though.
00:55:23 Where's the lie?
00:55:25 So I thought I'd make like true to life
00:55:27 vampires.
00:55:29 Transform into a big old demon
00:55:31 and she will
00:55:33 eat blood and kill you. She's not a nice
00:55:35 vampire
00:55:37 and she has a little sister who is a very nice vampire.
00:55:41 Cute.
00:55:43 Are there names upon on Daki Makara?
00:55:45 Yeah.
00:55:47 Although Makalar
00:55:49 has like Kalari
00:55:51 which is a cheese.
00:55:53 Oh, that's funny.
00:55:55 And Deki is like
00:55:57 Dekini which is like
00:55:59 a demon of mythology.
00:56:01 So it sounds like Deki Makara
00:56:03 but it's actually two different references.
00:56:05 That's clever.
00:56:07 Honestly, these designs are both
00:56:09 fucking fantastic.
00:56:11 Thank you. I need to draw them more.
00:56:13 I need to draw them having Halloween
00:56:15 hijinks.
00:56:17 Does it make sense that you're brown?
00:56:19 Don't vampires spend a lot of time in the dark?
00:56:21 What do they need a melanin for?
00:56:23 Yeah.
00:56:25 What do they need it for? Just get rid of it.
00:56:27 It's just not historically accurate.
00:56:29 It's just not historically accurate.
00:56:31 You made these Indonesian vampires
00:56:33 brown because
00:56:35 I don't know. European?
00:56:37 What about Europe?
00:56:39 What about Europe?
00:56:41 I don't know.
00:56:43 I just am upset by the melanin.
00:56:45 I'm angry and I don't know what to do about it.
00:56:47 You know, if this one could be brown
00:56:49 any woman could be brown.
00:56:51 That's a scary thought. What if my lady
00:56:53 was black?
00:56:55 That would be really bad.
00:56:57 True.
00:56:59 I was thinking the same thing.
00:57:01 You said it better than I could have.
00:57:03 Duh.
00:57:05 Duh.
00:57:07 Let's do a whole podcast we pretend to be racist.
00:57:09 No.
00:57:11 We already did. It's called the procrastinator's podcast.
00:57:13 The procrastinator's podcast.
00:57:15 Measuring Ben Skull before we crush her with a train.
00:57:17 It's called
00:57:19 the procrastinator's podcast
00:57:21 Season's 1 through 5.
00:57:25 Bonus episode.
00:57:27 The racism episode where we do a whole character
00:57:29 where it just says racist is possible.
00:57:31 Right?
00:57:33 Money maker? Alright.
00:57:35 Just throwing it out.
00:57:37 Upvote in the comments
00:57:39 if you want to hear us be racist.
00:57:41 If you want to hear us be racist
00:57:43 and we'll pay to see it.
00:57:45 I'll do anything for money.
00:57:47 Um...
00:57:49 Ah jeez.
00:57:51 I can't blame us.
00:57:53 Um...
00:57:55 Well...
00:57:57 Well...
00:57:59 You know...
00:58:01 That's it. That's it. That's all I got.
00:58:03 Crazy.
00:58:05 I joined late so I don't know
00:58:07 if this was a topic already.
00:58:09 There was a...
00:58:11 There was some funny
00:58:13 conversation
00:58:15 about a YouTuber called Boy in a Band.
00:58:19 No, I know who that is.
00:58:21 I've not heard anything about
00:58:23 that current controversy.
00:58:25 There's not a lot to say right now.
00:58:27 Um...
00:58:29 Hold on.
00:58:31 You've probably seen what he looks like before
00:58:33 if I get a picture. Oh, it's the guy with the red hair.
00:58:35 The guy with the red hair.
00:58:37 He's British but he didn't talk like that.
00:58:39 I don't know. Some groomer or something.
00:58:41 Yeah, it's right.
00:58:43 I mean, he's well groomed.
00:58:45 Yeah.
00:58:47 But don't stay in school guy.
00:58:49 I liked this guy's videos for a long time
00:58:51 until he just kind of like stopped
00:58:53 making good videos and then kind of just fell off
00:58:55 for a couple years and didn't upload but...
00:58:57 Um...
00:58:59 I've seen him before
00:59:01 somewhere.
00:59:03 Yeah, he popped up on my feet
00:59:05 again recently.
00:59:07 He made a song with high dubs at one point.
00:59:09 He made a song of PewDiePie and Jayden Animations
00:59:11 and he's been around.
00:59:13 Yeah, I vaguely remember that.
00:59:15 I found Jayden porn in the wild.
00:59:17 Like, organically.
00:59:19 Like, some just came
00:59:21 across my
00:59:23 screen all on its own
00:59:25 and I was like, wow, okay.
00:59:27 I can't believe it.
00:59:29 Like, just now?
00:59:31 I mean, I'd heard about it.
00:59:33 I just, it had never...
00:59:35 I'd never stumbled across it myself
00:59:37 but I did the other day.
00:59:39 It would be funny if a controversy was
00:59:41 boy in a band secretly
00:59:43 Jayden porn artists.
00:59:45 That would have been...
00:59:47 That would have been a fucking thing.
00:59:49 But, uh...
00:59:51 What I knew about this is
00:59:53 I know one of his exes made a video about him
00:59:55 like a year or two ago basically
00:59:57 calling him a dick.
00:59:59 Neglectful, whatever, sort of stuff.
01:00:01 Like, not a good partner
01:00:03 sort of things, you know, which is...
01:00:05 Yeah.
01:00:07 He does have red hair.
01:00:09 That does mean that you're, like, your edgy
01:00:11 dangerous hair in promos.
01:00:13 The new...
01:00:15 The new allegations are that
01:00:17 there's sort of, like, sex culty.
01:00:19 Like, he supposedly has
01:00:21 like a harem of, like, five to six girls
01:00:23 at a time who are mostly young,
01:00:25 some...
01:00:27 possibly, like, 17
01:00:29 or something. Well, he's, like,
01:00:31 in his 30s.
01:00:33 And that he's, like, super, like, controlling, manipulative
01:00:35 versus woman-to-be polyamorous when they don't want to
01:00:37 or something. The only
01:00:39 issue I have right now is there isn't
01:00:41 any evidence at all, but, like,
01:00:43 maybe that will come out, so I'm just going to wait and see.
01:00:45 Oh, if there's no evidence.
01:00:47 I mean, well...
01:00:49 There's no smoke without fire, but
01:00:51 you can light your own fire.
01:00:53 From what I've seen, it's mostly just
01:00:55 from one reddit post, and it's very well written.
01:00:57 Like, I'm inclined to, you know,
01:00:59 it seems very sincere. I don't...
01:01:01 It doesn't, like, seem at all, like, you know,
01:01:03 I don't get up or anything.
01:01:05 But their Imgur album
01:01:07 is just a bunch of, like, text messages
01:01:09 between two anonymous people
01:01:11 who aren't this guy, and they're just, like,
01:01:13 messages, like, oh, do you remember
01:01:15 when he said this? Yeah. Oh, do you remember
01:01:17 when his penis was small? Yeah. Do you remember
01:01:19 when he couldn't get an erection? Yeah.
01:01:21 Do you remember when he was dumb, and it's, like...
01:01:23 That doesn't prove
01:01:25 much, but maybe more people
01:01:27 come out, so we'll see.
01:01:29 The main thing I remember, like,
01:01:31 I've learned from the whole pro-charity
01:01:33 thing, is that
01:01:35 you can have, like, some weird
01:01:37 shit going on, and
01:01:39 people will, like, expose
01:01:41 that. But they will
01:01:43 add their own stuff
01:01:45 out of nowhere, and make it
01:01:47 so much worse than it actually is.
01:01:49 Yeah. Yeah.
01:01:51 So, like, I'm not inclined to agree with
01:01:53 this reddit post immediately. I mean,
01:01:55 not immediately. Could have some truth to it.
01:01:57 Yeah, like, there is some truth.
01:01:59 One of his
01:02:01 girlfriends, he dated, like, 10 years
01:02:03 ago, or over 10 years ago at this
01:02:05 point, maybe, was 17
01:02:07 while he was, like,
01:02:09 20... I don't know if he was, like, 23
01:02:11 or 25. It was in that range.
01:02:13 Which is... Is that in the UK? It's a bit
01:02:15 creepy, but it is the UK. It's not
01:02:17 illegal. Yeah. It's not illegal.
01:02:19 It's a bit creepy, especially, like...
01:02:21 But also, that was, like, a while back
01:02:23 there was less... I feel like there was
01:02:25 less awareness about...
01:02:27 Or maybe less consciousness about how creepy
01:02:29 that kind of thing was back then.
01:02:31 But, like, I don't know, like,
01:02:33 sure, like, he did that. That's a little...
01:02:35 That's kind of weird. That's kind of sussy.
01:02:37 But, like, that's not a smoking gun to all
01:02:39 the new allegations, right?
01:02:41 I mean, it may be sussy.
01:02:43 I mean, the new allegations are
01:02:45 that he's a controlling
01:02:47 polyamorous
01:02:49 boyfriend? That he has...
01:02:51 That he, like, prays on, like, young
01:02:53 women and uses his fame and money to, like,
01:02:55 use his fame into being with him, and then he treats
01:02:57 him like crap and kicks him out if they ever
01:02:59 cross him. That's what they're saying now.
01:03:01 Which, oof, is true.
01:03:03 I mean, of course he does.
01:03:05 Obviously he does.
01:03:07 Everyone famous does that.
01:03:09 I wouldn't be... I wouldn't be...
01:03:11 I wouldn't be shocked.
01:03:13 That's just what I expect from anyone who's
01:03:15 famous on YouTube or probably anywhere.
01:03:17 Yeah. Like, I think...
01:03:19 I mean, what's... I don't get it. I don't get...
01:03:21 I don't even get why it's a story.
01:03:23 Yeah. To be honest.
01:03:25 It's probably true.
01:03:27 But I don't fucking grab my pitchfork yet.
01:03:29 I don't care enough.
01:03:31 And some more concrete stuff comes out.
01:03:33 I mean...
01:03:35 I don't know. I mean,
01:03:37 the story would be
01:03:39 oh, he's doing stuff with minors.
01:03:41 Right?
01:03:43 He's doing illegal stuff
01:03:45 with people who are too young
01:03:47 to consent legally or
01:03:49 ethically. Right?
01:03:51 That's the...
01:03:53 That's the smoking gun.
01:03:55 Anything short of that
01:03:57 is like...
01:03:59 Oh, he's a bad boyfriend?
01:04:01 Oh, he's using his fame to manipulate women?
01:04:03 Well, I mean...
01:04:05 Yeah.
01:04:07 I mean, okay.
01:04:09 I guess I didn't know this guy.
01:04:11 So, yeah, I didn't know this guy at all.
01:04:13 So, it doesn't matter to me whether he's a dickhead or not.
01:04:15 I assume everyone who's famous
01:04:17 is a dickhead.
01:04:19 Assumption. Very good assumption, to be honest.
01:04:21 Yeah.
01:04:23 I mean, this guy stumbled across my feet
01:04:25 and that was my baseline assumption.
01:04:27 Alright, who's this dickhead?
01:04:29 Oh, he's a cult leader?
01:04:31 Oh, okay.
01:04:33 Does he make them
01:04:35 have hair like his?
01:04:37 That'd be...
01:04:39 That'd be kind of funny, actually.
01:04:41 He's got nice hair.
01:04:43 He's got a nice head of hair on him.
01:04:45 You know, you gotta respect
01:04:47 a nice head of hair.
01:04:49 You know what? I take it all back. I love this guy.
01:04:51 Absolved.
01:04:53 Absolved.
01:04:55 Nice hair.
01:04:57 Yeah.
01:04:59 How many sex crimes
01:05:01 is having nice hair worth?
01:05:03 How many can you get away with because of that?
01:05:05 Two?
01:05:07 Like one per follicle.
01:05:09 As many as there are stars in the sky.
01:05:11 Yeah.
01:05:13 Yeah, I'd never...
01:05:15 What does this guy do? Is he a musician?
01:05:17 He was like...
01:05:19 He would like do like
01:05:21 funny like...
01:05:23 He's like, hey, I'm gonna make a
01:05:25 rap song about this topic
01:05:27 and I'm gonna do it really fast.
01:05:29 He would collab with people like Andrew Huang
01:05:31 or Rob Scallon
01:05:33 or people who did rap and metal stuff.
01:05:35 Usually just kind of like
01:05:37 here's a funny idea for a song
01:05:39 that has this restriction
01:05:41 and I'll just make it.
01:05:43 It's also known as having
01:05:47 not enough fame
01:05:49 as a musician to get by
01:05:51 so I go to YouTube.
01:05:53 Yeah, and he started like doing videos
01:05:55 like...
01:05:57 Like, hey, here's the man...
01:05:59 Oh my god, he had one video called
01:06:01 the man who would save in the world
01:06:03 and you've never heard of him.
01:06:05 And did you know there's this guy who's like
01:06:07 a real life Iron Man who
01:06:09 created PayPal and builds rockets?
01:06:11 Oh yeah, his name's Elon Musk.
01:06:13 No! No! No!
01:06:15 I mean,
01:06:17 how long ago was that?
01:06:19 It was 2015, to be fair,
01:06:21 like...
01:06:23 How many people knew about it back then
01:06:25 or knew about how full of shit he was?
01:06:27 So...
01:06:29 I couldn't have told you
01:06:31 that Elon was cringe
01:06:33 back in 2015 so I can't...
01:06:35 It's funny but I can't really judge.
01:06:37 I mean, I didn't know Elon was cringe until
01:06:39 around like 2018, to be fair.
01:06:41 Even then, I was late to the party.
01:06:43 Yeah, it's
01:06:45 just because it's only in recent years
01:06:47 that like...
01:06:49 His
01:06:51 bullshit, all his like hyper-loop
01:06:53 all his hyper-loop bullshit
01:06:55 and so on and so forth.
01:06:57 Alright, I mean, yeah, okay.
01:06:59 Pretty cringe video, bro, but like...
01:07:01 Was that around the time?
01:07:03 Okay, was that before or after
01:07:05 he went on The Simpsons and Lisa said
01:07:07 he's the most important inventor of our time?
01:07:09 I have no idea.
01:07:11 So this was like January 2015,
01:07:13 so...
01:07:15 Coming up on...
01:07:17 You know what? Okay, this actually really blows.
01:07:19 Even if it is before.
01:07:21 People knew as well.
01:07:23 This sucks.
01:07:25 Well, I watched this video in 2015
01:07:27 and I'm like, I've never heard of this guy
01:07:29 but wow, he is cool because I just, you know,
01:07:31 I just assume that a YouTuber
01:07:33 I like wouldn't like put a bunch of
01:07:35 information in their video.
01:07:37 Right.
01:07:39 Never trust anyone,
01:07:41 especially yourself.
01:07:43 Uh...
01:07:45 Oh my god, I don't trust myself.
01:07:47 All the comments are like...
01:07:49 Yeah, this didn't age well.
01:07:51 Yeah.
01:07:53 Uh...
01:07:55 It really, like...
01:07:57 Even if it's like...
01:07:59 Oh, this guy's really cool.
01:08:01 Saying the guy who is saving the world is a bit like...
01:08:03 It sounds like you're already buying
01:08:05 into the Kool-Aid, the hype.
01:08:07 Like...
01:08:09 It doesn't sound like...
01:08:11 If somebody was inventing something amazing
01:08:13 or was doing something really good,
01:08:15 you would be able to point to
01:08:17 more specific things
01:08:19 than...
01:08:21 He's saving the world. It seems a little...
01:08:23 A little over-bloated.
01:08:25 Damn, this guy's got 3 million subs.
01:08:29 This is a big channel.
01:08:31 Yeah.
01:08:33 It's sort of like maybe a tell-tale sign
01:08:35 that there isn't actually much there.
01:08:37 If like...
01:08:39 You're blowing his ego so big.
01:08:41 Oh wait, I just remembered.
01:08:43 There is one other cringe thing that he did.
01:08:45 He made like...
01:08:47 You probably see this a lot on YouTube these days
01:08:49 where people you're subscribed to
01:08:51 will put up community posts
01:08:53 with polls that you can vote on.
01:08:55 Yeah.
01:08:57 I don't really look at them, but yeah.
01:08:59 There's a lot on this.
01:09:03 So like, he put up a poll
01:09:05 that was like...
01:09:07 Asking his fans,
01:09:09 hey guys, so I got to describe these antidepressants
01:09:11 and, you know, I took like one
01:09:13 pill and it didn't work.
01:09:15 Should I chug the entire bottle?
01:09:17 You know, I feel like
01:09:19 that would be good for me, you guys.
01:09:21 You know, maybe it would help me, haha.
01:09:23 And then the results were,
01:09:25 yeah man, chug the whole bottle, do it.
01:09:27 No, David.
01:09:29 That is not a good idea, follow the instructions.
01:09:31 And it was like...
01:09:33 He's asking his fans
01:09:35 if he should fucking overdose.
01:09:37 Yeah.
01:09:39 Did he do it?
01:09:41 No, he didn't do it.
01:09:43 But like, he kind of like
01:09:45 romanticizes like depression
01:09:47 and suicidality.
01:09:49 It's like his quirky personality.
01:09:51 He does look like the type.
01:09:53 Yeah, it is very cringy.
01:09:55 I see.
01:09:57 I see.
01:09:59 This...
01:10:01 Oh fuck, I just...
01:10:03 I remembered because it's in the
01:10:05 recommendations of this video.
01:10:07 Either you two watch Action Button,
01:10:09 either you two keep up with that.
01:10:11 There's a new Action Button this week.
01:10:13 No, what's Action Button?
01:10:15 It's the Tim Rogers
01:10:17 YouTube review, yeah.
01:10:19 He did a...
01:10:21 It's a six hour long video about
01:10:23 Yasumi.
01:10:25 Which is a game that I had seen,
01:10:27 but I couldn't have told you the name of.
01:10:29 That's the one where you play as a kid
01:10:31 on summer vacation and you catch bugs.
01:10:33 Ah, Boku no Piku.
01:10:35 No, no, no.
01:10:37 No, Boku no Piku.
01:10:39 It's about being a kid on summer break
01:10:41 and you catch bugs and you live
01:10:43 with your aunt and uncle.
01:10:45 And that's the game.
01:10:47 Whatever, it's a pretty good video.
01:10:49 Although, a lot of the video
01:10:51 is going on a little road trip
01:10:53 and showing footage of his
01:10:55 like, hey, this is my house
01:10:57 that I grew up in.
01:10:59 This is my town that I grew up in.
01:11:01 Every time people talk about Tim
01:11:03 Rogers, they mention
01:11:05 that he goes on about himself a lot.
01:11:07 Does that add to the video
01:11:09 or is it just interesting because
01:11:11 you want to know about Tim?
01:11:13 I'll be honest.
01:11:15 It's butting up against the line of
01:11:17 aren't we talking a little bit too much
01:11:19 about yourself?
01:11:21 He's always riding that line.
01:11:23 He's a good presenter.
01:11:25 He's a good orator.
01:11:27 He's hearing him speak is entertaining.
01:11:29 Sometimes I am
01:11:31 find myself thinking, do we need to know
01:11:33 do we need to see all of this
01:11:35 vacation footage? Do we need to know
01:11:37 like all these anecdotes
01:11:39 about growing up in
01:11:41 Indiana?
01:11:43 This guy looks really funny.
01:11:45 Tim Rogers?
01:11:47 He's
01:11:49 debuted on
01:11:51 YouTube like last year.
01:11:53 Is this him?
01:11:55 What the fuck?
01:11:57 He was there.
01:11:59 Is that the Revolutionary War?
01:12:01 He grew up and trained the Revolutionary War.
01:12:03 He's been around a long time.
01:12:05 I mean, he's like
01:12:07 40, so yeah.
01:12:09 That makes sense. That adds up.
01:12:11 Yeah.
01:12:13 The math checks out.
01:12:15 New video
01:12:17 was pretty good.
01:12:19 He sort of had the breakout hit
01:12:21 with the review of
01:12:23 what was that dating sim?
01:12:25 The PCB dating sim.
01:12:27 Not unfortunately.
01:12:29 No.
01:12:31 The seven hour video
01:12:33 about
01:12:35 Tokimeki Memorial
01:12:37 and this one feels a lot like that
01:12:39 because it's another like
01:12:41 Tim Opines on what a game
01:12:43 means for like Japanese
01:12:45 a moment in Japanese
01:12:47 cultural history or
01:12:49 whatever and it's very much like
01:12:51 the game is contemplative
01:12:53 and not your typical
01:12:55 gaming fare so
01:12:57 a lot of
01:12:59 introspection.
01:13:01 A lot of like, hey look at this
01:13:03 video I took on vacation though.
01:13:05 Maybe a little too much this time.
01:13:07 I think he crossed the line a little bit.
01:13:09 But it's okay.
01:13:11 I forgive him.
01:13:13 And now you know.
01:13:15 I don't forgive him.
01:13:17 Okay.
01:13:19 I'm good.
01:13:21 I mean, he doesn't deserve forgiveness.
01:13:23 Okay, well.
01:13:25 There'll be just a sec. I need to pee.
01:13:27 Okay.
01:13:29 Well, that's my week in
01:13:31 YouTube news.
01:13:33 The new action button is
01:13:35 always an event.
01:13:37 The last action button was
01:13:39 Cyberpunk 2077
01:13:41 and that was like
01:13:43 late last year.
01:13:45 So it's been like the better part of a year
01:13:47 for this video to come out.
01:13:49 Feels like only
01:13:51 yesterday.
01:13:53 It cannot believe it's been that long.
01:13:57 But oh well. What are you going to do?
01:13:59 What am I going to do?
01:14:01 What are you going to do?
01:14:03 I'm going to scream and cry, okay?
01:14:05 Go for it. Yeah.
01:14:07 All right.
01:14:09 All right.
01:14:13 Shit.
01:14:15 Well.
01:14:17 I was out of stuff to say.
01:14:19 I was going to, you know.
01:14:21 I don't know.
01:14:23 I was going to relate like a
01:14:25 story of some shit that
01:14:27 happened kind of in my real life.
01:14:29 But it's a bit like
01:14:31 dour and a bit like
01:14:33 upsetting, honestly.
01:14:35 I have a little bit, it's like
01:14:37 should I even talk about it in public?
01:14:39 It's kind of a thing.
01:14:41 I don't know.
01:14:43 Yeah.
01:14:45 I guess I can sort of relate.
01:14:49 Hey, hey, Gabe.
01:14:51 Should I relate my
01:14:53 kind of like upsetting and unsettling
01:14:55 real life anecdote?
01:14:57 Oh hell yeah.
01:14:59 All right.
01:15:01 All right.
01:15:03 It's kind of blows. It sucks.
01:15:05 It ruined my week.
01:15:07 It blows and sucks. The full package.
01:15:09 Yeah. You wouldn't think you could do both of those.
01:15:11 Well, I don't know.
01:15:13 There's, you know, I just moved into this new house
01:15:15 when there's a bunch of other people
01:15:17 that live here.
01:15:19 And I sort of don't see them too much
01:15:21 of them. So like,
01:15:23 I've had a couple moments where it's like, oh, it's this person
01:15:25 who lives here that I haven't met yet.
01:15:27 Well, let me introduce myself to them.
01:15:29 Well, I don't know.
01:15:31 I had a...
01:15:33 There's a girl that lives here.
01:15:35 And I kind of had the first like, oh hello,
01:15:37 it's nice to meet you.
01:15:39 With her.
01:15:41 And I don't know.
01:15:43 I won't go into too much detail about it, but there was a...
01:15:45 I don't know.
01:15:47 She made a kind of upsetting
01:15:49 statement.
01:15:51 She sort of claimed that like
01:15:53 another guy that lives there is like
01:15:55 violent.
01:15:57 And she was like, oh,
01:15:59 that's bad.
01:16:01 Lives with her?
01:16:03 Yeah, that's what she said.
01:16:05 She threw it out really casually.
01:16:07 Like, oh yeah,
01:16:09 this other guy, what the phrase she used
01:16:11 was he has a quote unquote tendency toward
01:16:13 violence.
01:16:15 And I said, that sounds bad.
01:16:17 And she was like, yeah, but it's only with me.
01:16:19 That's only really with me though.
01:16:21 What?
01:16:23 Oh.
01:16:25 It doesn't sound like a joke.
01:16:27 It doesn't sound like a jokie phrase.
01:16:29 It wasn't a...
01:16:31 No, it wasn't a jokie phrase.
01:16:33 Good thing she can't...
01:16:35 Good thing they can't see your giant hit spinner
01:16:37 or else you'd be in danger too.
01:16:39 I don't know.
01:16:41 I'll be honest.
01:16:43 I didn't know if I should believe her
01:16:45 or if she was like...
01:16:47 Or if she was just making it up.
01:16:49 I'll be honest.
01:16:51 Part of me was like, am I being tricked?
01:16:53 Is this some sort of weird
01:16:55 like
01:16:57 power play?
01:16:59 Some kind of weird social engineering
01:17:01 like trick that
01:17:03 is being played upon me?
01:17:05 Would it be more likely that she just doesn't
01:17:07 have anyone to confide in
01:17:09 about that?
01:17:11 I mean, I don't know.
01:17:13 She was like, you can't tell him if he is violent.
01:17:15 He's just gonna be violent.
01:17:17 I don't know. There's like five people that live here.
01:17:19 Me
01:17:21 and one other guy are new.
01:17:27 I'll be honest. I related this story
01:17:29 the other day
01:17:31 at Kazi's birthday
01:17:33 and everyone was horrified with me.
01:17:35 Everyone was disgusted with me
01:17:37 because I did not believe women.
01:17:39 Because I was...
01:17:41 Yeah.
01:17:43 So I probably shouldn't have even brought it up.
01:17:45 I don't know.
01:17:47 It was just, I don't know.
01:17:49 Maybe I was too quick to judge.
01:17:51 Just the way that she so
01:17:53 casually said it
01:17:55 and then just immediately moved on from it
01:17:57 and did not give any additional details
01:17:59 just made me like
01:18:01 I don't know.
01:18:03 It just seemed really strange.
01:18:05 What would the trick be
01:18:07 if she were tricking you?
01:18:09 Like it was a...
01:18:11 I guess the idea would be that it was an attempt
01:18:13 to turn me against this guy
01:18:15 for whatever.
01:18:17 For some reason.
01:18:19 And I don't know what the reason would be.
01:18:21 I feel like it's easier to believe
01:18:23 that some guys are just
01:18:25 dickish and violent in general
01:18:27 and
01:18:29 super like next level mind games.
01:18:31 Because I've met a lot of
01:18:33 dudes who are just
01:18:35 violent dickheads.
01:18:37 That's pretty common.
01:18:39 Yeah.
01:18:41 But I mean
01:18:43 she didn't elaborate
01:18:45 or say what happened
01:18:47 or if anything happened.
01:18:49 I just don't know.
01:18:51 I feel like
01:18:53 she was a random
01:18:55 basically a stranger.
01:18:57 Hmm.
01:18:59 Okay.
01:19:01 Yeah, but
01:19:03 I don't know what to do with this information.
01:19:05 It's obvious Ben.
01:19:07 You have to be a hero.
01:19:09 You have to get your claymore and you have to go slay the dragon.
01:19:11 And go kill him.
01:19:13 Don't even ask one question.
01:19:15 Don't even learn who he is.
01:19:17 Just go on a rampage.
01:19:19 Yeah, just right in Hath, you know.
01:19:21 Hmm.
01:19:23 Oh well, I guess I'll go do that.
01:19:25 Well, all right, I'll see you next episode.
01:19:27 I'm going to go catch a case.
01:19:29 I'm going to go commit violence.
01:19:31 But righteous violence.
01:19:33 Yeah, I don't know.
01:19:35 This is completely ruined my week.
01:19:37 This is like so upsetting.
01:19:39 Yeah, sounds pretty weird
01:19:41 to happen.
01:19:43 Yeah, I was
01:19:45 I was very dismayed
01:19:47 with the reaction that I got
01:19:49 from
01:19:51 Kazi and everyone
01:19:53 when I talked about it.
01:19:55 I felt like a real dick.
01:19:57 But I
01:19:59 really don't know what to do.
01:20:01 So that's me right now.
01:20:03 That's where I'm at.
01:20:05 It's bugging me.
01:20:07 Do you feel like
01:20:09 it would be better or worse
01:20:11 if you tried to follow up on it?
01:20:13 If you tried to ask her
01:20:15 what she meant
01:20:17 or even talk to the guy?
01:20:19 I don't know.
01:20:21 I mean, if it's true,
01:20:23 if it's true
01:20:25 and I tell the guy
01:20:27 that she said that,
01:20:29 that seems like it would be bad
01:20:31 and it would make him angry.
01:20:33 Not to tell the guy
01:20:35 the truth.
01:20:37 Just to talk to him to see what he's like.
01:20:39 I mean, I have talked to him
01:20:41 a little bit a couple of times
01:20:43 and he seems fine.
01:20:45 He could be a monster in secret.
01:20:47 I don't know.
01:20:49 I don't know this guy well.
01:20:51 I've only met him
01:20:53 a few times
01:20:55 and I've just moved into
01:20:57 a house with him.
01:20:59 I can't really say
01:21:01 anything about him personally.
01:21:03 I haven't noticed anything myself.
01:21:05 I mean, here's the thing.
01:21:07 When I was talking to her,
01:21:09 the first thing she said to me
01:21:11 was she wanted to talk about
01:21:13 utility bills
01:21:15 and she asked me
01:21:17 if I would take over responsibility
01:21:19 of putting
01:21:21 the bills in my name
01:21:23 and I didn't want to do that.
01:21:25 And then when I said
01:21:27 I said I would ask this other guy
01:21:29 about it and she said
01:21:31 he has a tendency
01:21:33 towards violence
01:21:35 and so
01:21:37 I was like
01:21:39 hmm
01:21:41 what is
01:21:43 Is this a persuasion?
01:21:45 I don't know
01:21:47 this is why I was like
01:21:49 didn't know what she was doing.
01:21:51 I mean
01:21:53 I thought that my roommate Sean
01:21:55 had a persuasion toward violence
01:21:57 but that was in the form of when he talks
01:21:59 about hand gestures and I flinched
01:22:01 and that's it.
01:22:03 So
01:22:05 yeah
01:22:07 I mean maybe
01:22:09 it's
01:22:11 like did she like come out and say
01:22:13 I've been abused or just of this guy
01:22:15 like
01:22:17 the only thing she said is he has a
01:22:19 quote unquote tendency toward violence
01:22:21 which could mean
01:22:23 a lot of things.
01:22:25 There's a wide range of interpretations
01:22:27 right.
01:22:29 I wouldn't worry too much for now
01:22:31 just keep it on
01:22:33 just in case.
01:22:35 I guess what else can I do
01:22:37 yeah
01:22:45 I
01:22:49 I don't know I've had people tell
01:22:51 me stuff
01:22:53 in the past
01:22:55 like that very like
01:22:57 sort of emotionally charged
01:22:59 things like that and it has been
01:23:03 manipulation
01:23:05 it makes me wary
01:23:07 the lack of details
01:23:09 I don't know it just
01:23:11 it gave me a weird feeling
01:23:13 like it was a trick
01:23:15 but
01:23:17 maybe my instincts are wrong and bad
01:23:21 possibly
01:23:23 I couldn't possibly say having not
01:23:25 been there
01:23:27 true
01:23:29 well sorry to be a downer
01:23:31 I know this sucks I feel terrible
01:23:33 about it.
01:23:35 If it's given you a grief
01:23:37 do you think
01:23:39 you need to do something to stop
01:23:41 that or
01:23:43 I just don't know what I could do
01:23:45 or if anything would be appropriate
01:23:47 to do
01:23:49 yeah it's tricky
01:23:51 my first thought is like Oscar
01:23:53 to elaborate
01:23:55 but then I wouldn't expect her to
01:23:57 to elaborate you might get more
01:23:59 questions
01:24:01 I mean if I had been
01:24:03 in that original conversation
01:24:05 they were like oh they have a tendency to
01:24:07 be like whoa
01:24:09 like how come
01:24:11 should I be worried?
01:24:13 I'd definitely ask fellow questions immediately
01:24:15 but I think the moment's passed
01:24:17 yeah maybe I should have jumped on it
01:24:19 and like please explain
01:24:21 but I kind of she kind of moved on
01:24:23 from it and so I kind of just was like
01:24:25 okay
01:24:27 yeah maybe I should have asked to follow them
01:24:29 I mean you probably sort of like you know the other day when you said this
01:24:31 like what did you mean exactly
01:24:33 should I be scared you know
01:24:35 you know maybe
01:24:37 she's not around very often
01:24:39 like this was the first time
01:24:41 I've seen her I've only seen her twice
01:24:43 in the whole month that I've lived here
01:24:45 like she's mostly out of the house
01:24:47 most of the time
01:24:49 so I don't know when I'll get
01:24:51 another chance to do that but like eventually
01:24:53 I surely will
01:24:55 so yeah maybe that should be the plan
01:24:59 okay that's the plan
01:25:01 alright game plan
01:25:03 got it
01:25:05 alright
01:25:09 ah yes
01:25:11 sorry about that sorry about that it's bummer
01:25:13 lame
01:25:15 it's a real life moment
01:25:17 okay yeah unfortunately
01:25:21 well I don't have anything else to talk about
01:25:23 that's all that's all I got
01:25:25 I swear there's something
01:25:27 I have on my brain
01:25:29 but my brain is like dead
01:25:31 dude
01:25:33 I don't remember anything
01:25:35 oh you know what I could talk about this
01:25:37 I'm not gonna do it just because like
01:25:39 daily arts challenges in October
01:25:41 is
01:25:43 something that literally everybody does now
01:25:45 and it's so many
01:25:47 that I feel like I would be
01:25:49 too normie to do it myself
01:25:51 but I did have a cool idea
01:25:53 which I kind of started
01:25:55 one year and I didn't
01:25:57 do anything is
01:25:59 October
01:26:01 we draw dicks every day
01:26:03 that's a good one
01:26:05 I think I will draw like maybe
01:26:07 where is she going with this
01:26:09 I'm going right to the groin
01:26:11 that's where I'm going
01:26:13 drawing dicks
01:26:15 for one
01:26:17 for anatomy
01:26:19 practice and also ha ha penis
01:26:21 it's true
01:26:23 and also it's better fit
01:26:25 than like inktober
01:26:27 coctober sounds like october
01:26:29 it's just got to cut the front of it
01:26:31 that's what we should have all been doing from the start
01:26:33 I'm sorry
01:26:35 we moved on already but I just remembered something
01:26:37 I just remembered something about
01:26:39 that's the situation
01:26:41 I was asking another guy
01:26:43 because I said there's two guys that live here
01:26:45 me and another guy are both new
01:26:47 and I asked the other guy
01:26:49 not about what she said about this other guy
01:26:51 but I asked him about
01:26:53 the utility bill
01:26:55 I said something about like oh yeah she said
01:26:57 something about like someone else
01:26:59 was like
01:27:01 late on payment or something she said
01:27:03 because she said that the guy that she said
01:27:05 has a tendency toward violence
01:27:07 he had like not paid his bill
01:27:09 or something and this was why she wanted
01:27:11 me to take over responsibility
01:27:13 for like
01:27:15 taking the bills in my name
01:27:17 because this guy
01:27:19 had not paid his bills and I mentioned
01:27:21 this to this other guy
01:27:23 and I just said yeah she said that that other guy
01:27:25 didn't pay his bills and this guy's
01:27:27 immediate reaction to that was he shook his head
01:27:29 and he said like don't believe her
01:27:31 like I don't believe her
01:27:33 and I was like okay
01:27:35 I also think she's a tricky
01:27:37 I don't know why
01:27:39 I didn't follow up on it with him
01:27:41 I don't know
01:27:43 I don't know
01:27:45 the whole thing gives me a really bad
01:27:47 feeling
01:27:49 yeah
01:27:51 you know understandable
01:27:53 what if this is a woman moment we don't want that
01:27:57 we wouldn't
01:27:59 we truly would not want that
01:28:01 I don't know
01:28:05 back to
01:28:07 October
01:28:09 sorry never mind
01:28:11 I want to do Cocktober I'd love to draw a dick
01:28:13 every day I have so many characters
01:28:15 with dicks so many other cool characters
01:28:17 I can give dicks
01:28:19 yeah it's like the perfect crime
01:28:21 except it's not a crime
01:28:23 you're allowed
01:28:25 everyone's allowed to draw a dick
01:28:27 it's a crime except you're allowed to do it
01:28:29 what if it was legal
01:28:31 what if crime was legal
01:28:33 that's like that's Cocktober
01:28:35 yeah drawing one thing every day
01:28:37 just doesn't work out
01:28:39 it seems so
01:28:41 as simple because how long does the drawing take
01:28:43 like five minutes
01:28:45 but you're always gonna I mean I
01:28:47 personally I'm always gonna want
01:28:49 it to be decent like presentable
01:28:51 of an image
01:28:53 so I don't want to skimp it on it
01:28:55 I don't want to have it be
01:28:57 a shit drawing but sometimes
01:28:59 I just don't have the time
01:29:01 I don't get around to it until 11 o'clock
01:29:03 and I'm like well
01:29:05 I'm sleepy
01:29:07 I gotta do something and then I do something that sucks
01:29:09 and I'm like fuck
01:29:11 shit
01:29:13 and it just makes me feel bad for the next day
01:29:15 or I'm like I gotta make up for yesterday
01:29:17 by making a better drawing and it just doesn't work
01:29:19 it's hard to do
01:29:21 like the it's so easy to draw
01:29:23 but so hard to draw for a month straight
01:29:25 yeah
01:29:27 I've never
01:29:29 I've never done ink tober
01:29:31 when I've sort of done it
01:29:33 I've only done maybe like four or five
01:29:35 drawings and then
01:29:37 no more
01:29:39 I will draw like
01:29:41 yeah I'm not gonna
01:29:43 do the whole month
01:29:45 but I will draw a few
01:29:47 don't know how many maybe even just two of them
01:29:49 maybe even just one
01:29:51 but that's gonna be my cock tober
01:29:53 you can find it on
01:29:55 at biggirlsquish on twitter
01:29:57 just one drawing
01:29:59 yeah
01:30:01 like unironically
01:30:03 it doesn't need to be a whole big thing
01:30:05 I don't want it to be for me
01:30:07 it could even just be like one big canvas
01:30:09 that throughout the month
01:30:11 doesn't have to be every day you just draw
01:30:13 cocks some days you draw a few cocks some days you draw none
01:30:15 and then you post the whole canvas
01:30:17 this whole canvas all October
01:30:19 that could even be another approach
01:30:21 and then you draw like a character
01:30:23 looking at them all being like
01:30:25 which one do I take
01:30:27 which one do I choose
01:30:29 how many do I have enough holes
01:30:31 oh shit gotta make some new ones
01:30:33 oh god what does that mean
01:30:35 I don't know
01:30:37 just cut yourself
01:30:39 hopefully not
01:30:41 shoot yourself
01:30:43 just grow extra titties
01:30:45 you know
01:30:47 oh that's what it means
01:30:49 oh
01:30:51 yeah
01:30:53 I've seen the porn
01:30:55 I know how this works
01:30:57 I haven't
01:30:59 well it seems Ben
01:31:01 when a mother and father love each other very much
01:31:03 they sometimes draw pornography
01:31:05 um
01:31:07 you mean
01:31:09 you mean that when two parents
01:31:11 of any gender
01:31:13 in this
01:31:15 under these woke skies that we live under
01:31:17 woke skies
01:31:19 anyone can be a mother or father
01:31:21 these are just terms
01:31:23 terms
01:31:25 it's all just words
01:31:27 at the end of the day
01:31:29 like you can have like a gay couple
01:31:31 where one is considered the mother and the other the father
01:31:33 I think that's
01:31:35 that's allowed
01:31:37 linguistically technically
01:31:39 yeah
01:31:41 under international law
01:31:43 and if you're a non binary you can say parent
01:31:45 you've got the whole gang
01:31:47 just wanted to be inclusive
01:31:49 just wanted to be inclusive
01:31:51 good
01:31:53 when parents love each other very very much
01:31:55 they draw porn on you
01:31:57 understood
01:31:59 I do like mother and father though
01:32:01 because mommy and daddy are funny words
01:32:03 yeah
01:32:05 is there like a baby version of parent
01:32:07 I don't think so
01:32:09 baby version
01:32:11 what would a baby call their like non binary parent
01:32:13 they can't say mama
01:32:15 they can't say dad dad what do they do
01:32:17 cancel the baby
01:32:19 we've got to find a way for the future generations
01:32:21 to not get cancelled immediately
01:32:23 I know
01:32:25 these bubbies are
01:32:27 going to have a bad time
01:32:31 I think maybe
01:32:33 we should just make mommy the gender neutral term
01:32:35 that everyone uses
01:32:37 I know why you want that
01:32:39 I want mommy I need milk I need to be held
01:32:41 yeah
01:32:45 don't they just kind of don't babies just kind of
01:32:47 say like mama
01:32:49 or do they say mama because like they
01:32:51 someone teaches them to
01:32:53 they get taught in other languages they say other things
01:32:55 they do say other things
01:32:57 I think it's just
01:32:59 it's simplified in that way because babies
01:33:01 can make vowels
01:33:03 and then interrupt those vowels
01:33:05 and it sometimes sounds like mama
01:33:07 dad dad go ba ba ba ba
01:33:09 yeah I feel like I feel like the M sound
01:33:11 is probably one of the easiest noises for a
01:33:13 stupid fucking baby
01:33:15 to make to go
01:33:19 I mean who doesn't have to call
01:33:21 them anything
01:33:23 he doesn't have to say anything he can just
01:33:25 scream
01:33:27 well yes that's what they do
01:33:31 but like what would you teach your baby to call
01:33:33 you because they can't say your full name
01:33:35 that's too difficult
01:33:37 can you say
01:33:39 zuzu
01:33:41 can you say pee pee
01:33:43 pee pee would be good
01:33:45 pee pee is funny
01:33:47 I don't know
01:33:49 I don't know I'm not sure about that one
01:33:51 I don't know about that one
01:33:53 someone tells me that one's in use already
01:33:55 in use
01:33:57 like a restroom
01:34:01 yeah it's occupied
01:34:03 it's like wall street
01:34:05 I understand
01:34:07 wall street
01:34:09 it's occupied
01:34:11 oh right
01:34:13 of course
01:34:15 my brain just makes autistic relations
01:34:17 from one word to another it's bad
01:34:19 that's called pumice it's good
01:34:21 I get shit I need
01:34:23 one second while I grab a sparkling water
01:34:25 I imagine Ben saying
01:34:27 has like a bucket of sparkling water
01:34:29 and when he says grab he means
01:34:31 dunk his hand in and grab some molecules
01:34:35 I just need to grab those molecules
01:34:37 you know
01:34:39 I'm gonna grab your molecules Gib
01:34:41 yep that is
01:34:43 that is a frat I'd better believe it
01:34:45 oh no
01:34:47 I don't even know which molecules
01:34:49 exactly there's so many
01:34:51 I'm gonna be looking over my shoulder
01:34:53 saying which molecules are gonna be stolen
01:34:55 which ones are gonna be grabbed
01:34:57 you got a lot of that
01:34:59 that's 70% of my body
01:35:01 it's everywhere
01:35:03 yeah 70% is everywhere
01:35:05 that's the threshold
01:35:07 of everywhere
01:35:09 what
01:35:11 where was the 30%
01:35:13 no where
01:35:17 how can you calculate
01:35:19 30% of
01:35:21 the existence of the universe is
01:35:23 nowhere
01:35:25 no one knows
01:35:27 I don't know
01:35:29 what are you talking about
01:35:31 calculate the probability
01:35:33 of the quantum
01:35:35 superposition of the
01:35:37 wave form of reality
01:35:39 and the
01:35:41 information superhighway
01:35:43 yes
01:35:45 yes yes yes
01:35:47 got it
01:35:49 understood
01:35:53 you think we should go to voicemails
01:35:55 um
01:35:57 or yeah
01:35:59 I have one small thing it's another art thing
01:36:01 um
01:36:03 but it'll be pretty brief
01:36:05 go on
01:36:07 yeah sorry
01:36:09 I yesterday did something
01:36:11 that I've been meaning to do
01:36:13 for a long fucking time
01:36:15 which was update my character model
01:36:17 sheet
01:36:19 for my character failure
01:36:21 basically like just redrawing it
01:36:23 because
01:36:25 me and forays are both better at art now
01:36:27 and um
01:36:29 I think it looks a lot
01:36:31 fucking better
01:36:33 I'll just drop a little
01:36:35 comparison and chat
01:36:37 um it's
01:36:39 insane
01:36:41 the fucking difference at least to me
01:36:43 especially in the face
01:36:45 I mean you made like
01:36:47 really rapid art progress
01:36:49 um
01:36:51 I think it was last year or
01:36:53 whenever it was
01:36:55 you started drawing
01:36:57 whenever it was
01:36:59 specifically illustration progress
01:37:01 the original reference sheet was drawn by forays
01:37:03 before I even like
01:37:05 had started learning art
01:37:07 um
01:37:09 so I can like
01:37:11 show off like some of the comparison here
01:37:13 there it is
01:37:15 mainly the face just looks
01:37:17 a heck of a lot better now I think
01:37:19 well they look different
01:37:23 I mean uh
01:37:25 it looks more
01:37:27 feminine
01:37:29 which one's the new one
01:37:31 the new one is the one on the right
01:37:33 yeah
01:37:35 so the hair no longer wraps around the horns
01:37:37 oh it does I'm gonna have a
01:37:39 my reference sheet will just show that
01:37:41 it only wraps around sometimes like if it's messy
01:37:43 and I have a better way
01:37:45 of drawing that wrap around now
01:37:47 um
01:37:49 see the original was just by forays and since I've learned to draw
01:37:51 I've been able to
01:37:53 now do stuff
01:37:55 so that's a thing
01:37:57 she looks
01:37:59 she looks sad she looks like she's
01:38:01 less
01:38:03 her mouth curls up a bit
01:38:05 at a glance
01:38:07 she's like depressed
01:38:09 the small mouth just looks more
01:38:11 feminine
01:38:13 basically the eyes look a little more
01:38:15 focused I guess
01:38:21 the horns are definitely a better shape
01:38:23 I have a 3D model of them now that I use for reference
01:38:25 what I made
01:38:27 was that too
01:38:29 I think
01:38:31 my brain's fucking stupid right now
01:38:33 um
01:38:35 what was I saying
01:38:37 I forgot
01:38:39 I draw her mouth smaller when it's closed
01:38:41 but it still opens really big and scary
01:38:43 it's like a giant penis
01:38:45 so that's fine
01:38:47 for instance
01:38:49 for instance
01:38:51 as one does
01:38:53 yeah
01:38:55 I don't think I've ever done like a model
01:38:57 sheet
01:38:59 for referencing my own characters
01:39:01 I'm so lazy with that
01:39:03 like I draw them
01:39:05 and then every time I need to be like oh what does that character look like again
01:39:07 I just look at the previous images
01:39:09 they're always changing a little bit
01:39:13 like punk
01:39:15 I mean
01:39:17 let me find the first image of punk
01:39:19 she looks very different
01:39:21 from the way I draw now
01:39:23 yeah I would compose the full model sheet too
01:39:25 that was just for zoom in for the main differences
01:39:27 I've never really done
01:39:29 like yeah character sheets
01:39:31 I guess I did a phantom horn
01:39:33 character sheet for t-bat back in the day
01:39:35 but that wasn't like for my own reference
01:39:37 that was like to show people
01:39:39 like this is what the character looks like
01:39:41 it was for other people's reference not for mine
01:39:43 because the character looks like
01:39:45 whatever they look like in my head
01:39:47 to me and if it changes then like
01:39:49 so be it
01:39:51 when was the most recent time I drew punk
01:39:55 was it for the game
01:39:57 I suppose
01:39:59 I feel like I doodled her
01:40:01 I can't find anything
01:40:03 the only thing I have for this year
01:40:05 like really is the febubary stuff
01:40:07 which is funny
01:40:09 oh yeah
01:40:11 I've did febubary
01:40:13 and then occasionally I do a little doodle
01:40:15 and I say that
01:40:17 that's it
01:40:19 I haven't done a lot of art aside from the comics
01:40:21 I did the live stream image
01:40:23 it's not really the same
01:40:25 it's not really a punk image exactly
01:40:27 but I can't say I've gotten
01:40:29 better at art but I have
01:40:31 I mean this one looks a lot better
01:40:33 than the first one you posted
01:40:35 yeah
01:40:37 yeah I haven't done a lot
01:40:39 I haven't done that much art
01:40:41 well I guess I finished
01:40:43 I finished slime in punishment
01:40:45 that was pretty much like the only art I've really done this year
01:40:47 what were we talking about
01:40:49 we were just talking about art I guess
01:40:51 just talking about art
01:40:53 I hate that stuff
01:40:55 just kidding
01:40:57 I like this image
01:40:59 this is a great image
01:41:01 oh my god hi
01:41:03 hmm
01:41:05 it's like
01:41:07 if I played suburb I would throw my brisket plush
01:41:09 into the kernel sprite
01:41:11 and then all the imps would be brisket
01:41:13 and I would blush when I meet them
01:41:15 but they want to kill me
01:41:17 I saw this
01:41:19 scrimblow gib
01:41:21 and the big boobie mommy milkers
01:41:23 it's very good
01:41:25 very cute
01:41:27 very funny
01:41:29 disgusting imp
01:41:31 it has the eyelashes
01:41:33 it has the horns and the hair
01:41:35 it's grey
01:41:37 oh my god
01:41:39 yeah I hope
01:41:41 the griffs they're made of on your planet
01:41:43 is some kind of grey stuff
01:41:45 yeah
01:41:47 I forget the kinds of griffs they have
01:41:49 they're like gushers
01:41:51 well John has
01:41:53 oil and like cobalt
01:41:55 I think
01:41:57 oh yes that's right
01:41:59 the types of imp
01:42:01 yeah so I would hope that
01:42:03 they're named after stuff
01:42:05 so I would hope that yours would be something grey
01:42:07 like shale or
01:42:09 something like that
01:42:11 gravel
01:42:13 yeah dust is good
01:42:15 dust is good
01:42:17 dust imps yeah that would work
01:42:19 that would work just fine
01:42:21 and my planet is like
01:42:23 oh it's got dust all over it
01:42:25 so I gotta do the windy thing and blow the dust away
01:42:27 it makes more sense than John
01:42:29 actually with the oil
01:42:31 yeah why would oil
01:42:33 why would wind, why would breath blow oil away
01:42:35 doesn't
01:42:37 or no it doesn't know it's to clear the oil
01:42:39 out so that the pipes can
01:42:41 so the wind, the breath can blow through the pipes
01:42:43 yes that's it
01:42:45 yes yes that's it
01:42:47 I forget what my home stuck
01:42:49 like my chosen
01:42:51 thingy of thingy
01:42:53 my class bit
01:42:55 me
01:42:57 I remember it being like the page of
01:42:59 space or the page of void
01:43:01 or something
01:43:03 I like hope the best but
01:43:05 I don't know if I would be
01:43:07 I don't know if I would be it just because I like it
01:43:09 probably not actually
01:43:11 I'd probably be something that I don't like
01:43:13 like
01:43:15 blood
01:43:17 the bard of blood
01:43:19 blood sucks blood doesn't even do anything
01:43:21 at least car cat doesn't do anything
01:43:23 it's friendship though
01:43:25 it's bonds
01:43:27 is it though or is that just
01:43:29 fanning
01:43:31 I mean I think it's
01:43:33 implied heavily that car cat
01:43:35 is a good people person and he's good with
01:43:37 he likes the troll romance
01:43:39 and he's like easy to talk to
01:43:41 even though he's a little insane
01:43:43 he's got like relationship issues
01:43:45 which is like his blood
01:43:47 if it's like a relationship thing
01:43:49 there's clues here and there
01:43:51 like imply what blood is about
01:43:53 compared to all of the other aspects
01:43:55 that are not about that
01:43:57 okay I mean if yeah
01:43:59 I mean then he has that
01:44:01 blood packed with Jack Noir
01:44:03 oh right yeah and he cuts the
01:44:05 hand and it looks like the symbol
01:44:07 yeah yeah yeah yeah
01:44:09 that's hard to ignore
01:44:11 you're right
01:44:13 well I guess all of my art
01:44:15 skill my focus
01:44:17 has been on the pumpkin
01:44:19 family game but also
01:44:21 um this Clarissa comic
01:44:23 some of the little things I drawn
01:44:25 even though they're not even properly made yet
01:44:27 they're like oh that would be such a good
01:44:29 panel it's gonna be so fucking sick
01:44:31 when people read it I sure hope I don't
01:44:33 fuck it up in the process
01:44:35 of making it finished
01:44:37 I hope so too
01:44:41 I love cartooning
01:44:43 cartooning is good
01:44:45 should I dare I suggest
01:44:47 voicemails again
01:44:49 I guess
01:44:51 okay so I will
01:44:53 probably step out
01:44:55 for voicemails
01:44:57 oh yeah

01:47:53 did you see that um that painting
01:47:55 of chris as the girl
01:47:57 doing the like patting yourself
01:47:59 on the head and going bleh
01:48:01 oh I did
01:48:03 you drew that I think I've seen that
01:48:05 artist around yeah I've seen that artist
01:48:07 around people kept I kept
01:48:09 seeing people retweeting it being like
01:48:11 um can we not please
01:48:13 um can we not uh
01:48:15 and like they were like
01:48:17 retweeting it as they were saying it
01:48:19 like oh this is so bad no we shouldn't do this
01:48:21 but like they're like
01:48:23 mean they're like actively
01:48:25 yeah I know Pete the whole the whole point
01:48:27 of that particular meme is that it's
01:48:29 juxtaposed with things that are not the cutesy
01:48:31 enemy girl going ooh
01:48:33 well it's like like like the U.S.
01:48:35 government going ooh ooh I blew up
01:48:37 something yeah yeah it's like
01:48:39 no the kind of the point
01:48:41 here is that she did like what she did
01:48:43 was really bad and like it's like yeah
01:48:45 oopsie
01:48:49 people don't get it
01:48:51 um people are memed um

01:50:05 yeah there's no question mark
01:50:07 sorry next one is called
01:50:09 MLP confessions
01:50:11 three two one go
01:50:13 I have a confession make
01:50:15 I could never get into my
01:50:17 little piano guy
01:50:19 I remember back in
01:50:21 2012 2013
01:50:23 when the fandom was starting
01:50:25 and blossoming and I heard about it
01:50:27 and I just could not see
01:50:29 what other people saw in it
01:50:31 like maybe it's because I was
01:50:33 an entire audience or maybe I just
01:50:35 wasn't autistic enough to enjoy it
01:50:37 which is weird because
01:50:39 I feel like I should have
01:50:41 been no fancy
01:50:43 piano guys
01:50:45 like it's weird
01:50:47 PCP has given me a lot of insight on the
01:50:49 fucking debacle that was the piano guy
01:50:51 fandom
01:50:53 and like I feel like I missed
01:50:55 out on something
01:50:57 but at the same time I feel like I missed out
01:50:59 on nothing so I'm wondering
01:51:01 now that piano guy is effectively over
01:51:03 what's the final autopsy report
01:51:09 I don't remember that question
01:51:11 like the original
01:51:13 what's about my little pony
01:51:15 I don't remember any of these originals
01:51:21 the piano guy fandom
01:51:23 will live on in our pianos
01:51:25 the piano guy fandom
01:51:29 started with a bang
01:51:31 and it ended and it went out in a blaze of glory
01:51:35 short life cycle short but sweet
01:51:37 I like to go back
01:51:39 sometimes and listen to piano guy
01:51:43 it's nostalgic nostalgic for the good old days
01:51:45 you know the PCP started
01:51:47 as just a bunch of friends who just came together
01:51:49 over their shared love of the piano guy
01:51:53 those days are well behind
01:51:57 and we hate piano guy now
01:51:59 next one is called friends

01:52:13 and then I have another friend who's got like work
01:52:15 and that's like you know more reasonable
01:52:17 but he's like oh I have to work all the time
01:52:19 can't die and like you know other stuff
01:52:21 like that like just friends that are busy

01:57:48 you know
01:57:50 This person is saying that Trixie cursed my hair line
01:57:54 Yeah, well the first thing he says is you could just will it back into existence. That's what he said. That's true
01:58:00 I guess I don't know why I didn't think of it like that
01:58:05 You just got to do a Dragon Ball Z. You just got to go
01:58:13 I don't know. I don't know. Thanks for the advice guy
01:58:16 Next one is called. Hey, you suck on pronouns by the way. What the what the fuck is that?
01:58:21 Yeah, what the fuck was she what the fuck was he or she and then and then he after that like
01:58:28 You're you're you're you're in shambles. You're in shambles my guy next one is called a Gibbs layer
01:58:35 three two one go
01:58:42 I mean, oh, I'm not slain guess. It wasn't as funny as saying die. Yeah
01:58:50 Yeah
01:58:51 You could have just all it took was one word
01:58:55 next one is called
01:58:57 Don't dope smite and no, thank you
01:59:03 Three two one go
01:59:12 I
01:59:18 See the CEO of a large central exchange of cryptocurrencies
01:59:24 Will go into birth all the supply like the Joker
01:59:29 Which means supply and demand the less is more you buy. No, it becomes a one dollar and only
01:59:36 Yeah.
01:59:40 At least.
01:59:42 Did you understand that?
01:59:44 Something about buying into a cryptocurrency
01:59:47 because they're gonna burn the cryptocurrency
01:59:50 or someone's gonna burn it.
01:59:52 I don't know, that doesn't make sense though.
01:59:54 You can't buy it and then have the thing devalue,
01:59:58 but you have like, it's not like gold.
02:00:02 You having a lot of it, whatever, it's stupid.
02:00:05 Yeah, I don't know.
02:00:08 Don't do it.
02:00:09 Just don't do it.
02:00:10 Next one is called,
02:00:11 Hey Ben, new fan here.
02:00:12 How is being bald and what does that mean?
02:00:16 Nothing.
02:00:17 It's just a joke.
02:00:18 It was just a joke.
02:00:19 Ha ha ha.
02:00:21 You fell for it.
02:00:22 Next one is called,
02:00:23 Happy Birthday Ben.
02:00:25 Thanks.
02:00:26 Next one is called,
02:00:26 They Are Back.
02:00:28 Oh.
02:00:30 Three, two, one, go.
02:00:32 I love how you guys always engage
02:00:34 with the question,
02:00:35 doesn't matter how stupid it is,
02:00:36 like, what do you two think about pineapples?
02:00:43 Pineapple.
02:00:44 Interesting.
02:00:45 What about segregation?
02:00:49 Interesting.
02:00:50 I see, very interesting.
02:00:55 Wait, what do you say about segregation?
02:00:57 I think he just said it was interesting, very interesting.
02:01:01 Or he asked us what we think about it.
02:01:04 Oh, I think it is bad.
02:01:05 I think that pineapples and segregation are equally bad.
02:01:09 I wouldn't eat segregation on pizza.
02:01:13 Hmm, I would,
02:01:16 I would segregate my pizza though.
02:01:19 I would keep pepperoni on one side.
02:01:20 You segregate it whenever you cut it into eight.
02:01:23 Exactly.
02:01:24 Keep the pepperoni on one half
02:01:27 and no pepperoni on the other half for the vegetarians.
02:01:29 No, no, I'm a calzone girl.
02:01:32 I got a no segregation on the pizza.
02:01:34 One pizza, curl it up, eat it like a ice cream,
02:01:39 like a big old ice cream cone.
02:01:49 Segregation and pineapples, they're both,
02:01:52 they're not back, they never left, baby.
02:01:54 They're here to stay.
02:01:56 Did I tell you, I had a pineapple on a pizza
02:01:58 a little while ago and I thought it was pretty good.
02:02:00 When we had it at Radcon three, I didn't like it.
02:02:04 But I had like a, from a better pizzeria,
02:02:07 not that long ago and it was like cooked better
02:02:10 and it was good, I liked it.
02:02:12 And it was with pepperoni.
02:02:14 It wasn't ham and pineapple, it was pepperoni and pineapple.
02:02:17 And it was well cooked so the pineapple
02:02:20 kind of like melted in.
02:02:21 Ah!
02:02:24 Does it still taste sweet?
02:02:25 Cause that's the reason I wouldn't like it.
02:02:27 The reason I didn't like it was because,
02:02:29 like when it was still in like chunks,
02:02:34 it's kind of like has like the fruity,
02:02:36 pulpy texture of it and the sweetness is in that.
02:02:40 And it's just kind of weird to chew on.
02:02:43 The one that I had, it was like cooked well enough
02:02:47 that it sort of melted.
02:02:49 It almost kind of melted on top of the pizza
02:02:51 and it worked much better.
02:02:54 Yeah, see, for me, it's just anything sweet.
02:02:59 And like a main course just feels wrong.
02:03:02 Like a main meal, it has to be savory or spicy or, you know,
02:03:08 it can't be sweet.
02:03:10 Sweet is for dessert only.
02:03:11 It doesn't make sense to me that you would have sweet things.
02:03:15 Like if there's a curry, but it has like dates in it
02:03:18 or raisins or bits of stuff.
02:03:22 And it's like, it's sweetness, that's not right.
02:03:28 That's my take.
02:03:30 It needs to be handled with delicacy.
02:03:34 Decent with decency.
02:03:36 And in modern societies, it doesn't have.
02:03:39 Since we just don't have, we've lost the nuances.
02:03:43 We've lost the nuances of adding sweet to savory dishes.
02:03:47 The next one is called YouTube 321 Go.
02:03:50 There's nothing.
02:03:52 Terrible.
02:03:52 The next one is called Evangelion Bad 321 Go.
02:03:57 I don't understand why Gendo was so abusive to Shinji.
02:04:02 If my wife died under circumstances that could have been my fault
02:04:06 and the years I spent with her were the only time
02:04:07 in my life that I felt truly happy,
02:04:10 I would have simply moved on and found new happiness
02:04:12 by raising my son.
02:04:14 Gendo's behavior simply makes no sense.
02:04:16 Zero.
02:04:17 Can't relate to it.
02:04:18 Bad show.
02:04:20 Why not just be a good dad?
02:04:24 Then Shinji would smile.
02:04:26 Why not just be a good dad?
02:04:28 Hey, Misato, why just not be a pedophile?
02:04:32 Why not simply skip that part?
02:04:35 Is she a pedophile?
02:04:36 Does she come onto Shinji?
02:04:38 I can't even remember.
02:04:39 Yeah, they make out.
02:04:41 Misato?
02:04:42 Well, don't they kiss before his final Eva mission
02:04:48 or something?
02:04:51 I mean, it will depend on if it was on the cheek or not.
02:04:53 Maybe she says that they'll fuck afterwards or something.
02:04:57 She implies it.
02:05:00 I mean, she is very openly adult around Shinji
02:05:06 and Shinji's just whatever.
02:05:08 Yeah.
02:05:09 Yeah.
02:05:10 It's mostly her being drunk, though.
02:05:12 I don't know if she did a pedophile, but she may have.
02:05:15 I mean, I don't know if she did a pedophile.
02:05:17 She kind of comes on to him,
02:05:20 but it's sort of like,
02:05:24 I don't know if she was into him.
02:05:27 I think she was doing it to get him to do something,
02:05:30 to pilot the Eva, basically, which makes it okay.
02:05:34 Yeah, of course.
02:05:35 Just like Gendo's behavior was also okay
02:05:38 because it led to Shinji piloting the Eva.
02:05:41 At the end of the day,
02:05:44 at the end of the day, you've gotta punch that alien.
02:05:46 We need Shinji to pilot the Eva
02:05:47 by whatever means necessary.
02:05:51 I saw a good reply to that thread.
02:05:53 Somebody else, quote, treated that idiot's thread about it.
02:05:58 Because in that thread, the guy says,
02:06:00 it doesn't make any sense
02:06:01 that Shinji is still going to high school
02:06:04 while he's piloting the Eva.
02:06:09 And this thread that I saw, quote, tweeting,
02:06:12 it was like, wow, maybe it's not a mistake,
02:06:18 that that's weird.
02:06:19 Maybe the fact that the character is at once
02:06:22 both involved in this fate of the world,
02:06:27 hyper-military science organization,
02:06:30 and also going to regular high school,
02:06:33 maybe that's not a fuck-up,
02:06:34 maybe it's deliberately weird.
02:06:36 Like that, it never even answers this guy's head
02:06:39 that the creators of the show
02:06:42 might have realized that and done it on purpose
02:06:45 and thought about it.
02:06:47 Yeah, it's like strange, isn't it?
02:06:51 Hmm, yeah.
02:06:52 Maybe he should be a normal kid
02:06:55 and go to school and have friends
02:06:58 instead of everything else.
02:07:02 Now, I gotta drop out of school
02:07:04 and pilot a robot because robots are so fucking cool.
02:07:08 Why didn't they, he could have had a private tutor.
02:07:11 What, you think Nerve couldn't afford a tutor?
02:07:14 They could have had a private tutor.
02:07:15 We didn't have to keep going to high school, man.
02:07:18 Doesn't make any sense, logistically.
02:07:19 Man, high school sucks.
02:07:21 True.
02:07:23 Next one is called What Would You Do
02:07:25 If You Were Trixie, Suicide.
02:07:28 Next one is called Ben's Weekly Reminder,
02:07:32 Play Delta Room Chapter Two, okay.
02:07:34 Next one is called Ben's Weekly Reminder,
02:07:36 catch up on one piece, okay.
02:07:38 Next one is called, well, it's a Twitter link.
02:07:42 Um, what's this?
02:07:45 Throw a moment to gaymail.com.
02:07:49 Power isn't determined by your size,
02:07:51 but the size of your heart and dreams,
02:07:55 total combat losses of the enemy from February 24,
02:07:59 is this about the war in Ukraine?
02:08:00 This is, yeah, Ministry of Defense of Ukraine
02:08:03 quoted Monkey D. Luffy in a tweet
02:08:06 when they are talking about how
02:08:08 they've killed so many Russians.
02:08:11 Oh my God, they did.
02:08:14 What the fuck?
02:08:18 Is this real?
02:08:19 It's verified.
02:08:20 DefenseU.
02:08:24 Gov.
02:08:24 Ukraine, yeah, this is a verified Ukraine
02:08:27 government organization.
02:08:28 They quoted Monkey D. Luffy.
02:08:31 Okay, sure, I guess.
02:08:34 So they are reporting 59,000 eliminated personnel,
02:08:40 plus bunches of vehicles that have either
02:08:43 been abandoned or destroyed.
02:08:46 That's funny.
02:08:51 Are you worried about nuclear war, by the way?
02:08:54 About nuclear war, I mean, I was more worried before.
02:08:59 Russia was like failing so heavily.
02:09:02 I feel like all of the Russia's failings
02:09:06 of logistics and just having good equipment
02:09:10 and having soldiers that are willing to fight,
02:09:13 it sort of speaks to a lack of like funding for these things.
02:09:23 I feel like Vladimir Putin definitely
02:09:26 wanted to win by intimidation.
02:09:28 And I feel like the nuclear thing could also be intimidation.
02:09:32 I don't think he has enough nukes to threaten everyone,
02:09:37 compared to how many anti-nuke defenses
02:09:40 the rest of the world has.
02:09:42 He might use a nuke in Ukraine.
02:09:44 I think that is possible.
02:09:46 Yeah, I was reading about it last night,
02:09:48 and it seems like if nukes are going to get involved,
02:09:51 they're going to be probably tactical nukes in Ukraine,
02:09:56 which is bad.
02:09:57 Tactical nukes in Ukraine, it would be horrible.
02:09:59 I don't want that either.
02:10:01 But I don't feel like it's like, oh, nuclear annihilation,
02:10:04 doomsday approaching.
02:10:06 It would just be like Russia would do that.
02:10:10 And then having done that, they would be destroyed
02:10:14 by literally everyone else.
02:10:16 I don't think Vladimir Putin is silly enough
02:10:19 to actually do it still.
02:10:22 I was reading a couple of articles about it.
02:10:25 And the consensus seems to be that even Russia's allies,
02:10:33 India and China would not like it if Putin started nuking people.
02:10:40 No.
02:10:40 So it would be bad for Russia.
02:10:43 I mean, Putin might be inclined to do it anyway,
02:10:49 just for his own reasons.
02:10:50 But it's not in Russia's interests to do it.
02:10:55 None of this has been in Russia's interests,
02:10:57 which is, I guess, the precedent that he could do it.
02:11:01 He could completely and permanently tank
02:11:03 like Russian's credibility as a nation going forward forever.
02:11:08 If he does this, he does a nuke.
02:11:11 Because he doesn't have what it takes to back it up afterwards.
02:11:20 Yeah.
02:11:22 I was worried about, like, oh, am I going to get nuked?
02:11:25 And like, yeah, it's probably, we're probably not looking at a,
02:11:30 like, they're not going to jump right to nuking the American mainland
02:11:34 or even anywhere, like, yeah.
02:11:37 It would be like a combat nuke, if anything.
02:11:41 Yeah.
02:11:42 And even that.
02:11:42 He's going to hold out for as long as possible.
02:11:45 Yeah.
02:11:45 I, like, I'm having to do it.
02:11:48 But I think, I think.
02:11:50 Because it's the threat of it that is, like, of the effective bargaining.
02:11:55 Yeah.
02:11:56 And nobody believes him.
02:11:57 And, like, I feel like he knows that nobody believes him.
02:12:02 Yeah.
02:12:03 So he's like, he doesn't have much else he can do at the moment.
02:12:06 I feel like what's most likely is that Ukraine will eventually push back
02:12:11 the Russian forces to the border.
02:12:14 And once that's happened, Zelensky might try to get a peace thing going.
02:12:21 Because I don't think Ukraine wants to invade Russia.
02:12:24 They have no reason to.
02:12:26 So I kind of expect it to just go like that.
02:12:30 I don't think Putin would use a nuke if he couldn't follow it up.
02:12:35 I don't think he can follow it up right now.
02:12:39 I mean, he definitely can't follow it up.
02:12:42 No, like, you just destroy it like he is.
02:12:45 And then, like, you still get pushed back because the army
02:12:48 and the rest of Ukraine is still strong enough to do it.
02:12:51 Yeah.
02:12:53 The consequences for doing that, I think, would be pretty bad.
02:13:00 Next one is called More Voice Males Like Last Week, Please.
02:13:05 Three, two, one, go.
02:13:07 Well, OK.
02:13:09 This guy likes what they heard.
02:13:13 Yeah.
02:13:14 Well, guess what?
02:13:15 You did get more voice smells like last week.
02:13:17 So congratulations.
02:13:22 Next one is called I'm So Happy Voice Males Are Back, Thank the Lord.
02:13:25 Three, two, one, go.
02:13:28 It's zero seconds.
02:13:30 Oh, yeah, you're right.
02:13:31 But there was a cut.
02:13:33 It's so stupid that people use these to just deliver a, like,
02:13:38 eight-word long written message and no voicemail.
02:13:42 But oh well.
02:13:43 Next one is called Wong, Wong, Wong.
02:13:45 Three, two, one, go.
02:14:05 Was that like a stuttering Chinese man morphing
02:14:09 into Arnold Schwarzenegger at the end?
02:14:11 I thought it was.
02:14:11 Was he attempting to mimic like a voice, like audio fuckery, like stutter, like?
02:14:18 I don't think so.
02:14:19 I think it was just a racist voice he was doing.
02:14:23 Maybe.
02:14:24 I mean, it was definitely that.
02:14:26 But there's layers.
02:14:27 I felt like maybe he was attempting to mimic the sound of like a record repeating or like
02:14:34 it having been edited to sputter, I'm not sure.
02:14:40 Next one is called carbon offsets are a scam and your NFT is fucking bad.
02:14:45 Three, two, one, go.
02:14:47 Carbon assessor fucking bullshit and don't do anything you goddamn moron.
02:14:53 Why did I, why are you calling me that?
02:14:56 Why are you so mean?
02:14:57 He's talking to carbon offset stands.
02:15:03 I don't know.
02:15:04 Carbon offsets.
02:15:05 A carbon offset is, I assume it's something.
02:15:09 It's when you do something stupid, they say they'll plant a tree, they'll plant a tree
02:15:13 or something.
02:15:14 Okay.
02:15:15 Sounds good.
02:15:16 Maybe.
02:15:17 Sounds good.
02:15:18 Yeah, it sounds dumb.
02:15:19 This guy's probably right.
02:15:24 Next one is called death of a Ben St.
02:15:26 Oh, yes.
02:15:29 Okay, let's see what this voicemail, let's see what's behind this link.
02:15:44 It's a YouTube one minute 24.
02:15:48 Okay.
02:15:49 All right.
02:15:51 Three, two, one, go.
02:15:54 Probably can't.
02:15:55 I don't think we can play this.
02:15:57 I think.
02:15:58 No, because it's got a song in it, but we can put the visuals up.
02:16:03 Yeah, we can put the visuals up.
02:16:07 This is to say montage of Vinny's drawings of me.
02:16:13 Oh, he think he drew new ones for it.
02:16:18 Yeah, these are new.
02:16:20 He illustrated this whole song about me.
02:16:26 Wow.
02:16:34 It's probably not going to be the same without the music.
02:16:48 You're so sad.
02:16:49 Wait, this is death of a bachelor?
02:16:51 I was thinking of a different song.
02:17:01 Is that you in the orange dress?
02:17:04 I don't know.
02:17:07 Don't look like me.
02:17:09 No, it's a tricksy.
02:17:11 Oh, it's a tricksy.
02:17:14 Yes.
02:17:15 Oh, I see.
02:17:17 I see.
02:17:19 Excellent.
02:17:20 Funny.
02:17:22 Thanks.
02:17:23 Thanks, Vinny.
02:17:24 I liked it.
02:17:25 Yeah.
02:17:26 Next one.
02:17:27 How many?
02:17:28 Not that many left.
02:17:29 Hey, Ben.
02:17:30 New fan here.
02:17:31 I'm single if you're interested.
02:17:33 Nope.
02:17:34 Not even going to listen to the voice?
02:17:38 I did listen, but it's zero seconds, so there's nothing to it.
02:17:45 Oh, the last one is I didn't think when I sent it,
02:17:48 avoid getting copyright strike.
02:17:50 It's VVVV mute the vid, but still watch it, please.
02:17:54 Okay.
02:17:55 Three, two, one, go.
02:17:56 I'm playing the audio.
02:17:58 Be sure to mute the death of Ben saying the video in case,
02:18:03 like, am I going to copyright on the channel?
02:18:06 Yes.
02:18:07 I didn't really think about that when I sent it.
02:18:08 Yes.
02:18:09 That's okay.
02:18:10 We can put the link in the description and people can watch it themselves.
02:18:12 Right.
02:18:13 I mean, yeah, definitely we can't play the audio, but okay.
02:18:19 Got it.
02:18:20 I mean, I guess that's it.
02:18:23 I guess we're done.
02:18:25 Yeah.
02:18:26 What a week.
02:18:28 What a week.
02:18:29 It's so weird.
02:18:30 At the end of a week, I don't remember too much of what happened,
02:18:35 but it definitely days passed and days definitely passed.
02:18:43 Days.
02:18:44 Days definitely passed.
02:18:45 It's getting colder.
02:18:46 It's getting October.
02:18:47 It is getting.
02:18:48 It is getting colder.
02:18:49 October fast.
02:18:50 I had to bust out my space heater.
02:18:52 I had to turn off my air conditioner.
02:18:55 I might actually have to take it out of my window soon if you can believe that.
02:18:59 Oh.
02:19:00 Yeah.
02:19:01 But I don't know, whatever.
02:19:05 It's fine.
02:19:06 The colder weather means I can actually wear, like, clothes.
02:19:11 Like when it's hot, I can just, all I can do is wear like a t-shirt because anything
02:19:15 more and it's like, it's going to make me sweat.
02:19:18 But when it's chilly, I can actually make an outfit, which is nice.
02:19:23 Can wear a jacket.
02:19:24 Can wear a cloak.
02:19:25 Yeah.
02:19:26 You can wear a cape and a cloak hood.
02:19:29 Exactly.
02:19:30 Boots.
02:19:31 And wear a robe.
02:19:33 Wear a whole costume.
02:19:35 Wear a whole pumpkin man scarecrow outfit.
02:19:39 If I want, I don't, but I could.
02:19:43 I kind of like the idea of a punk helmet of some kind.
02:19:48 Like if I pad it, if I make it like warm and fuzzy and not like a pain to wear, it could
02:19:55 be like a warm thing.
02:19:57 I could wear it every day.
02:19:59 You can stuff it with straw.
02:20:00 And people will be like, what the fuck is wrong with you?
02:20:03 Well, that's your practice for wearing something outlandish in public.
02:20:10 True.
02:20:11 That's what you said you wanted to do, right?
02:20:13 On Halloween.
02:20:14 Yeah.
02:20:15 Just wear something stupid.
02:20:16 Oh, you know what?
02:20:17 I could cosplay a scraggity-acty.
02:20:21 The scarecrow OC that has the big straw tits.
02:20:27 You could make some straw tits if you put your mind to it.
02:20:32 All I need to do is believe.
02:20:37 I'm trying to think if there's anything I want to say before we end the show for this
02:20:47 week.
02:20:48 I don't know.
02:20:49 I'm going to keep grinding.
02:20:51 Yeah, just keep that Sigma grind set going.
02:20:55 I'm going to keep that Sigma.
02:20:57 Oh, there's a new folding ideas video.
02:21:01 I saw it.
02:21:03 It was good.
02:21:04 Yeah, it was pretty good.
02:21:13 Made me want to try it almost.
02:21:14 Part of me was like, what if I tried this?
02:21:16 What if I tried this book method and did it?
02:21:19 But I think it probably doesn't work, as he explains.
02:21:22 They don't actually do it anymore because it doesn't work.
02:21:27 Oh, as a method to like, I mean, I guess getting a ghost writer is still a thing that's possible.
02:21:36 Yeah, all the steps of the process are still possible to do.
02:21:41 I think it's probably not super effective anymore.
02:21:48 If it was super effective, they probably wouldn't be selling the method.
02:21:52 No.
02:21:53 Yeah, very, very, very funny grift, very funny grift.
02:21:59 The people who get into those grifts and they've always got YouTube influencer faces and hair
02:22:08 and clothes, there's always that sort of person.
02:22:11 I don't know why, but it just reminds me of, I don't know.
02:22:15 I imagine that that's the grown-up version of that bratty kid who does not get disciplined at all.
02:22:23 Like, oh, that kid is such a brat and they turn into one of these people.
02:22:27 Yeah, it's like, whatever they can get away with.
02:22:31 I think they're so clever because they found a cute little loophole.
02:22:37 It's like, this is for people that don't have the time or inclination to learn new skills because anyone could do that.
02:22:45 Like, that's me.
02:22:47 What a intriguing prospect.
02:22:50 I'll buy it.
02:22:52 Thank you.
02:22:53 I am the target demographic.
02:22:55 Thank you.
02:22:56 You mean if I put money, I can just get free shit and get my own money from putting money in?
02:23:03 If I just pay some money, I can get stuff for free?
02:23:05 That's crazy, dog.
02:23:07 Yeah.
02:23:11 Good video, though.
02:23:13 Yes.
02:23:14 I like Dan a lot.
02:23:20 Did I watch any other good videos this week?
02:23:22 No.
02:23:23 No.
02:23:25 Never.
02:23:28 I feel, it feels bad.
02:23:30 I feel like we haven't gone long enough.
02:23:32 Not even two and a half hours.
02:23:34 The comments are going to be furious.
02:23:38 It's hard sometimes having stuff to talk about.
02:23:41 Yeah.
02:23:42 I mean, I mostly had the last of us thing.
02:23:45 Aside from that, I'm just working on stuff.
02:23:50 Sometimes it's just a week goes by.
02:23:54 Well, let's try and manufacture something.
02:23:57 I hope my video will be done soon.
02:24:00 We'll be dropping in the very near future.
02:24:03 Maybe not before this week's episode comes out, but not too long after that, I think, is almost for sure.
02:24:10 Oh, you know what?
02:24:12 I can talk briefly about RuneScape.
02:24:15 Oh, sure.
02:24:16 Yeah, please.
02:24:21 My challenge run has been continuing, and I got bored mining coal, so I switched over.
02:24:28 Now I'm shopping down U-Logs, U-Trees to get U-Logs, and that's what I'm doing.
02:24:35 U-Logs.
02:24:36 I haven't thought to make a video.
02:24:37 U-Logs.
02:24:38 What about me, Logs?
02:24:39 Ah.
02:24:42 Never thought of that one.
02:24:46 Yeah.
02:24:47 It is one of those, like, I haven't got enough of an interesting thing to make a video about it, so there's no third installment yet of the RuneScape thing.
02:24:58 But when I have something to talk about it, I'll be like, and here's the update.
02:25:03 Wait, was there a second?
02:25:05 Oh, the second one was about the runite, right?
02:25:08 Yeah.
02:25:09 Like mining runite, or for the first time, it was like a milestone in my RuneScape career.
02:25:14 Not that it's a career just sort of like, since I was young, I was wanting to do it.
02:25:18 I've got a feeling this is going to consume the rest of your life, kid.
02:25:22 Oh, my God.
02:25:24 You're going to be at this.
02:25:25 This is the grind, the new Sigma grind set.
02:25:31 I kind of want, I kind of luckily Outer Wilds, but I haven't, just haven't, I haven't clicked on it yet.
02:25:37 But I want to, because it sounded really cool.
02:25:40 You described it in a way that made it sound real neat and nifty, so.
02:25:45 You should click on it.
02:25:46 Definitely want to check it out.
02:25:47 As soon as, as soon as this is, we finished here.
02:25:51 No, I gotta get worked.
02:25:52 Maybe, maybe after I edit for a while and I feel like I can't do anymore.
02:25:57 I'll use, you use it as a, as a carrot on a stick.
02:26:01 Yeah, yeah.
02:26:02 For you, this is the morning.
02:26:03 Yeah, pretty much.
02:26:04 Makes sense.
02:26:05 I often have the thing where like after the PCP is done for the day, I like get nothing done
02:26:10 for the rest of the day and I hate that.
02:26:13 I fall, I fall into the trap of like, I already did my stuff for the day, even though I then
02:26:17 have like most of the day left afterwards.
02:26:21 Yeah.
02:26:22 I mean, for me, I always classify weekends as like no work required.
02:26:27 Oh.
02:26:28 In fact, in fact, no work allowed.
02:26:30 I can't, like, I can't do it.
02:26:33 Yeah.
02:26:34 Other than.
02:26:35 So it's like forced rest and it's, it works.
02:26:38 I don't feel stressed during the weekend.
02:26:40 Other than.
02:26:41 And then when Monday comes around, I'm like, right, let's try and do something.
02:26:44 That's good.
02:26:45 Other, other than Sunday for PCP, I don't really distinguish days of the week.
02:26:49 Like my, my Saturday is the same as my Monday pretty much most of the time.
02:26:56 So, you know, it's probably healthy.
02:27:00 I think it helps.
02:27:01 It's probably healthier to have.
02:27:02 Yeah.
02:27:03 A designated weekend.
02:27:05 Yeah.
02:27:06 Cause it's, this is what I was saying a few, like weeks ago, the whole resting being very
02:27:13 important.
02:27:14 And if you're thinking about work, you're not resting.
02:27:17 And so like having a routine where it's normal and accepted and good that you don't work
02:27:23 makes it easier for you to rest on that day.
02:27:26 Instead, I will sort of just kind of work on a day that I can make myself do it and
02:27:32 I'll just do that for as many days as I can.
02:27:34 And then there will eventually come a day where I'm like, I let, I let something else
02:27:40 distract me and then I don't do anything for that day.
02:27:43 And then I'll get on a, on a, on a roll of like, okay.
02:27:46 So for the, for the next few days, I won't do anything until eventually I feel bad enough
02:27:51 and I'm like, oh God, how many I've wasted like three days.
02:27:54 I haven't worked on it in like four days.
02:27:56 Like, uh, terrible.
02:27:57 What a waste.
02:27:58 And then I'll.
