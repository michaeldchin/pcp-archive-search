00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I am the best
00:00:10 guy ever, and today we're joined by an illustrious cast of goons and scoundrels. First up, Ben
00:00:17 Saint.
00:00:18 Excuse me. I'm so sick because my body has been neglected. It's wasted away. What can
00:00:28 I do about that?
00:00:30 Only there was a solution. Munchy, where's Tony Hatch?
00:00:32 You gotta do this podcast quick because I'm melting. I'm about to be a puddle on the floor
00:00:35 in about 10 minutes.
00:00:38 Dude, I love Olaf from Frozen.
00:00:41 Dude, I love the Wizard of Oz.
00:00:43 Dude, I love the nuclear throne.
00:00:45 I skew.
00:00:46 I love water.
00:00:48 Hippocrite is here.
00:00:50 Hello, it's me, the weakest boy at the ball. I can't lift my own body weight. Here I am
00:00:57 on the floor.
00:01:00 Gravity is too strong for this man. And finally, we've got our special guest, the two-time
00:01:04 returning champion, FitMC.
00:01:07 Everyone in this podcast is a homo sapien.
00:01:09 I thought you were saying that in a different direction.
00:01:17 I don't want to think about that anymore.
00:01:18 Well, guys, today, we've done it. As you can tell, we've gathered our... It's time for
00:01:25 the illustrious second half of our world-famous Minecraft and fitness saga.
00:01:31 You were so gung... You just could not wait to do the back-to-back Minecraft and fitness
00:01:38 episode.
00:01:39 That was just your one fucking joy in the entire world. It was ripped from you.
00:01:43 I really was excited about... Ever since we were talking about getting Fit on an episode
00:01:47 of the PCP to begin with, I was really gung-ho to make the topic of that episode, fitness
00:01:53 and Minecraft, the two most inextricably linked subjects in the world.
00:01:58 A complex Venn diagram is generated.
00:02:02 There's a lot of connecting nodes there. It's like a brain with all these synapses connected
00:02:06 through a complex network.
00:02:09 Nate's got a map of the United States up on his wall right now with two thumbtacks
00:02:14 in it, one labeled fitness in the other mind, and he's got lots of red strings going in
00:02:18 between them, but they're just between these two points, so it's not a big web. It's just
00:02:23 a line.
00:02:24 Yeah. I mean, that's true, but so many can actually...
00:02:27 But they're linked. They are fucking linked. You cannot deny.
00:02:30 And they'll sit and he'll stare at the wall for 45 minutes, and then he'll nod to himself
00:02:34 and put up another string, and then the cycle repeats itself.
00:02:38 He spanned the entire yarn around those two points.
00:02:41 He connects the points, and then he just says back, like eyes wide, what does it mean?
00:02:46 That's what we're doing to solve today.
00:02:54 So to get into fitness, it simply must be defined. It simply must be defined. Okay,
00:03:00 now ironically, so the definition of fitness here, okay, here we go. Fitness, the core
00:03:06 of physical health, get off your computer and try it. That is the definition of fitness,
00:03:13 which a lot of thinking memes, emojis going on. What else have we got? There's got to
00:03:20 be a better one. Okay, fitness, here's another one. Fitness, the most important thing you
00:03:23 can have, without fitness, you're a fat homosexual who sits around all day watching movies on
00:03:30 your computer and eating cheez-its to be fit, is to be God, probably.
00:03:35 Urban dictionary is Nate. I think this has been a step.
00:03:39 I mean, it would not... I'm spoiling the future because I definitely will do this one day,
00:03:45 and I should just go in and knowing what the topic is, I should add a section of whatever
00:03:51 I wanted to say on Urban Dictionary the day before. I haven't done it yet, but I should
00:03:55 read it, and so I should ask someone to read it, because you can see who it's by at the
00:03:59 bottom. I should leave a little hint by saying that it was by me, and we'll see if anyone
00:04:03 gets a little hint. By the way, though, I just want to point out, on the list, every
00:04:09 Urban Dictionary thing has a list of related things. The third one down is FitMC, on the
00:04:17 Fit Urban Dictionary thing. Let's read what it has to say here. FitMC, a Minecraft YouTuber
00:04:24 that plays on a popular anarchy server, 2B2T, and in parentheses, also is very fit and muscly.
00:04:31 LaMau, FitMC has huge muscles.
00:04:33 Someone actually wrote that?
00:04:37 This is by anti-socialweeb from July 27th, 2016. That's who wrote this.
00:04:43 It's your biggest fan. I hope he's listening.
00:04:47 I like the example sentence, like used in a sentence, like a lull.
00:04:52 Yeah, it's in LaMau. It's in LaMau.
00:04:55 OfficialWeeb, please leave a comment letting us know, telling us your state of mind.
00:05:02 Right. How are you doing?
00:05:04 This episode comes on the heels of Ufit accomplishing a New Year's resolution, I believe.
00:05:09 Oh, yeah. My New Year's resolution this year, and I said it on Twitter on January 1st, I'm
00:05:15 like, I am going to finally do the one-armed pull-up. And yesterday, yesterday, I did it,
00:05:22 and I was so happy.
00:05:24 That's incredible.
00:05:26 Perfect timing for this podcast.
00:05:28 I just want to clarify, because some people, I've heard it in various circles, they consider
00:05:32 a one-armed pull-up that you have one hand wrapped around the bar, and you can grab your
00:05:36 other wrist and do a thing like that. Is that what we're talking about?
00:05:39 We're talking about just dangling from one arm.
00:05:41 They call it one-and-a-half sometimes.
00:05:43 It's just from one arm.
00:05:45 I just want to say, that is fantastic. Congratulations, of course.
00:05:48 I have long had a dream. Ever since I beat Final Fantasy 7 as a young child, and in the
00:05:53 final cutscene, I have a lot of fitness goals based on the Final Fantasy games.
00:05:58 But at the end of Final Fantasy 7, Cloud canonically does a one-armed pull-up while holding Tifa.
00:06:05 So that's maybe 160, 180 pounds. I mean, she's got big tits, so you know.
00:06:10 Maybe 80 pounds, maybe 40 pounds each.
00:06:14 Realistically, she's maybe 120 pounds to 140 pounds. That's probably about right.
00:06:19 That's about depending on your height.
00:06:22 I don't know.
00:06:24 Let's fucking debate how much Tifa weighs.
00:06:27 If you're talking about Final Fantasy fitness goals, though, mine is to suplex a freight train.
00:06:33 That is my Final Fantasy-related goal.
00:06:37 That's my next resolution, maybe.
00:06:40 I'll just name my other two. One is that Zell did 100 pull-ups before hitting level 1 at the beginning of Final Fantasy 8.
00:06:46 That was before he even joys the party, which I want to do.
00:06:49 And then just to run up as many flights of stairs in a building as Cloud did in Sheen Rage Q at the beginning of Final Fantasy 7.
00:06:56 With the equivalent of doing 100 pull-ups before reaching level 1 being like doing 100 pull-ups and then like doing episode of the PCP Nate?
00:07:03 Yeah, yeah. That'd be great. I could do that.
00:07:06 And you know what? I've looked into it. Doing 100 pull-ups is not like an insane goal to have.
00:07:11 When I was young, my record was 50. My record was 50 when I was in high school.
00:07:15 I feel like I could do a one-handed pull-up, but mostly because most of, like, the rest of my body has no mass to it.
00:07:22 Because you're like a swabloo, you know? There's just cotton balls and fuzz.
00:07:26 Pull-ups are fucking easy, but as soon as I actually get fit, they will be impossible.
00:07:29 Hippo is a drift loon.
00:07:32 As I'm sure you can tell, viewers, there are two fitness gods here and then laymen of varying degrees of disgust.
00:07:40 I would say either, I'm just gonna go on a limb here, either me or Hippo are probably the weakest, the weakest link in society here.
00:07:50 What are you talking about, Monchi? You are an absolute unit.
00:07:55 Okay, we can debate my unitness all day.
00:08:02 But the fact is, is that I don't look like it, but I'm weak as shit.
00:08:06 You would be forgiven for thinking that I'm some sort of weird, strong fat person, but no.
00:08:12 It's not like that, really.
00:08:15 There was this one moment during Radcon 3 where me and Monchi were running to a train and we were sprinting our fucking lungs out.
00:08:24 Oh god, that was the worst moment.
00:08:26 I was dragging my suitcase behind me, but I still ran faster than Monchi, so I think I win.
00:08:32 Okay, well hey, land speed is different from generated force in a punch or a push or whatever you know.
00:08:39 Actually, you reminded me of that, has confirmed, actually, I'm the strongest person to ever exist.
00:08:44 Because I was carrying six grocery bags on each arm, just like pulling them out, running as fast as I could.
00:08:51 Granted, I was huffing and puffing, and I almost passed out on the train, but I did it.
00:08:57 I did it, and the job got done.
00:09:00 There you go. That's some real shit.
00:09:02 Cardiovascular fitness is kind of the area that I want to grow in.
00:09:06 I mean, I don't know.
00:09:08 They say that the group of people in the world who has the highest degree of body dysmorphia is like men, like fit men.
00:09:16 That's what they say, because they're very self-conscious about wanting to be bigger and whatnot.
00:09:20 If you just go and fit on 4chan, you can prove that.
00:09:24 Yeah, I mean, they'll tell you that you're...
00:09:26 I love the images of the gigantic six foot one guide, and then the six foot zero midget freak standing next to him.
00:09:36 Those are my favorite. Those are my favorite.
00:09:40 But I mean, it's a real thing. It's a real thing.
00:09:44 It's always seemed to me that I've been very self-conscious of how I look.
00:09:48 And that's been a big motivator in why I wanted to work out and look better.
00:09:52 I mean, just recently, Michelle put out a video when we were at an aquarium that I was in, and I'm like, oh, I look fat and gross.
00:09:58 And I know mathematically speaking, objectively speaking, that I look pretty decent, but it's just not good enough.
00:10:06 And it consumes me. It consumes me.
00:10:09 It's time to air my dirty laundry.
00:10:13 Time to tell you all. All right, seeing myself specifically in all the videos from Radcon 3,
00:10:20 but especially in the Tails Gets Trolled lecture and comparing them to the Sonichi lecture, I was like, oh my god.
00:10:26 I'd gained maybe like 15 pounds since then, but looking at it and seeing it, I was like, oh my god.
00:10:34 It puts into perspective.
00:10:36 Oh, no.
00:10:38 Yeah, no. It was a wake-up call, so I've started getting back into lifting.
00:10:42 I had let it lie pretty fallow for a long time.
00:10:46 Yeah, I did that one.
00:10:48 That is great.
00:10:49 I'm making it a priority again.
00:10:51 That's why it's really important. A lot of people can just, I think the reason why people get like ridiculously morbidly obese, like in America,
00:10:58 is because they just like day to day is just not part of their lifestyle to like think about that stuff,
00:11:03 because we train human beings totally wrong in this country.
00:11:07 They should be way more conscious of fitness and how to eat healthy and survive and stuff.
00:11:11 I think me and Hippo are going to have a point to do about fitness and school and sports and shit later, so we'll come back.
00:11:17 Yeah, we can talk about that for sure, because they do it all fucking wrong.
00:11:20 I learned everything I know about fitness from like YouTubers and nothing from school.
00:11:25 I learned it all when I was in like late college.
00:11:29 I think you learned it all from Final Fantasy, Nate.
00:11:31 Well, that too.
00:11:32 When I was in college, I got really into like reading up about fitness and stuff.
00:11:36 I went on Fit a lot. I downloaded a lot of e-books and shit.
00:11:41 I was into it for a little bit, not like crazy, but I was like kind of fit.
00:11:46 I had like a pretty respectable deadlift for a little bit.
00:11:49 Yeah, your squats were always, I mean, you would see the squat like, your squats were like good?
00:11:54 Mine have always been utterly disgraceful and I don't know why.
00:11:58 I've been able to squat more than you, even when like I hadn't lifted for a while.
00:12:02 I don't even want to get into my numbers. That would just be embarrassing.
00:12:06 My numbers, you can't know.
00:12:08 I used to deadlift like 300 something and it was pretty sick, but now I haven't deadlifted in a while, so I don't know.
00:12:16 I felt like a cool guy sometimes.
00:12:20 Just FYI of your, a 315 deadlift is fucking disgraceful.
00:12:24 Like you should be deadlifting four plates, five plates, at least.
00:12:28 That's not a joke.
00:12:29 Wait, what are you deadlifting?
00:12:31 I'm deadlifting around three plates, like around 315 right now, which is disgraceful and it's pathetic and nothing.
00:12:37 Ben, what would you say your goal is?
00:12:40 Well, my goal right now is just to like get back into a routine of doing it.
00:12:47 Get back up to what I used to be doing at my best, which was squatting maybe like 250, it's like 245,
00:12:56 deadlifting like 300 something.
00:12:59 My bench was always pretty disgraceful.
00:13:01 My best bench ever was maybe like 165 or so.
00:13:04 I never managed to bench my body weight.
00:13:07 Oh yeah?
00:13:08 Yeah.
00:13:09 Maybe that should be my goal.
00:13:11 Maybe my goal, getting back into it, is like I'm finally going to bench my body weight.
00:13:15 That's a good goal and that's attainable for sure.
00:13:17 Yeah.
00:13:18 Do we have a fitness goal?
00:13:21 Well, now that I did the one-armed pull-up, I'm going to try to do it for reps and then also my other arm,
00:13:28 I can barely get my chin to the bar so I'm a little unbalanced.
00:13:33 But just in general, like just working on my body weight fitness because when I was like in my early 20s,
00:13:39 I was just a lifter.
00:13:41 I wanted to just look like a balloon animal, just hit the weights hard, squats and oats for big gains.
00:13:48 Go mad every day.
00:13:50 Yeah, I know, right?
00:13:52 In my later 20s and living so close to the ocean now and I do a lot of stuff in the water,
00:13:57 I kind of appreciate being at a lower weight because I feel like I can do more athletically like climbing, swimming, surfing.
00:14:05 It's hard to do that stuff when you are a higher body weight just because of all the lifting.
00:14:10 Yeah, that's true, that's true.
00:14:12 Well, that's cool.
00:14:13 I mean, I've kind of, I don't know, I want to be Z's, you know, there's no bones about it.
00:14:18 I want to look like Z's.
00:14:19 That's who I, that would be the ideal.
00:14:21 You want to be dead?
00:14:23 If you can do what Z's did and not die.
00:14:27 He died overdosing or something in like some brothel or something like fucking the Philippines or something.
00:14:31 Wait, really?
00:14:32 Yeah, he really did, he really did.
00:14:34 I don't know if he overdosed but something was up with his heart, he had like a heart issue.
00:14:37 Yeah, he had like a heart condition.
00:14:39 It might have just been that.
00:14:40 But it was like he did take like, you know, substance.
00:14:43 I'm sure the steroids didn't help his heart.
00:14:46 Yeah.
00:14:47 I thought he was natty.
00:14:48 I thought he was natty.
00:14:49 Oh, no, no, no, he was not.
00:14:51 Here's the thing about Z's.
00:14:53 His body, because he was so cut and so low in body weight, his physique is attainable natty,
00:15:00 but not in the speed he was able to do it in.
00:15:03 Right, right, right, right.
00:15:05 For those who don't know, by the way, Z's is kind of the god of the fitness board of 4chan.
00:15:10 He's an Australian cunt and he lived fast and died hard.
00:15:15 But he, you know, have you, Fit, have you watched Scooby 1961 much?
00:15:19 He's my fitness icon on YouTube.
00:15:21 I remember when I first started browsing the Fit board on 4chan, I'd watch some of his videos.
00:15:26 Yeah.
00:15:27 And he had some really informative stuff, like there was some form corrections I was able to make by watching his videos.
00:15:33 Yeah, I thought he was a really good fitness YouTuber to watch, really underrated.
00:15:38 Scooby's a goofy. Scooby's a weirdo.
00:15:41 He's super goofy and he's super gay, but, you know, all is forgiven.
00:15:45 Oh, yeah, yeah, forgive him.
00:15:48 We'll give him a royal pardon for being gay.
00:15:51 Yeah, exactly, exactly.
00:15:53 I was just going to say on the subject of Z's, he's made a video about how Z's is a better role model than Jeff's side.
00:16:00 Jeff's side's another, like, world-famous, like, fitness guy.
00:16:03 Because Jeff's side claims to be nady, and he may well be, but it's just that if he really is nady, his physique is unbelievable.
00:16:12 What is nady?
00:16:13 Yeah.
00:16:14 Oh, oh, no, no.
00:16:15 No steroids.
00:16:16 We should define our terms.
00:16:17 No steroids.
00:16:18 Yeah, no steroids whatsoever, just naturally obtaining, like, a good physique or whatever.
00:16:22 Big naturally slim, naturally muscular, any of that stuff.
00:16:25 So, yeah, no, no steroids.
00:16:27 I'm afraid I'm not Natty. My physique is not Natty because I've drank all this caffeine.
00:16:34 I've drank all this caffeine to give myself the jitters to burn off those extra calories.
00:16:38 Well, hey, I'll give you a pass because Scooby definitely consumes a lot of caffeine and calls himself Natty.
00:16:43 Does he?
00:16:44 Yeah, he loves caffeine.
00:16:45 I mean, I was just joking, but I'm surprised. He seems like the kind of guy who'd be like no caffeine,
00:16:49 no fucking, I don't know, polysorbinates or whatever.
00:16:54 You know, Scooby is very much a pragmatist and Scooby recognizes that like, okay, what does caffeine do to your body?
00:17:01 Like, it helps you get energy to do stuff. It has, you know, little to no side effects as long as you don't like take crazy amounts of it.
00:17:09 And I mean, that's really it. And so he's like, yeah, I mean, this seems fine. It doesn't seem harmful.
00:17:14 Because Scooby, what's great about Scooby and everyone, if you're interested in fitness, I would highly recommend you check out Scooby 1961 on YouTube.
00:17:20 He is, he is the goat as far as I'm concerned for learning this shit.
00:17:24 He's conscious of tooth. He's got like two goals.
00:17:28 One, to be super muscly and ripped because he just loves looking that way and God bless him for it.
00:17:33 And then a second goal, probably even more important is to just like be super cardiovascularly fit.
00:17:39 Like he loves doing, he does like half Ironmans. He does like bikes across China and like huge crazy trips and stuff.
00:17:46 Despite having like this huge busly physique and he's a huge guy.
00:17:50 So he's just he's just working towards like these are his goals and he devises strategies to help him achieve those things.
00:17:57 You know, and if you have different goals, well, you got to use some different strategies probably.
00:18:01 But and he's developed all these tools on his website, Scooby's Workshop.com that you can use to like help you with whatever your goals are.
00:18:09 And it's fucking great. It's fucking great.
00:18:11 Let me let me talk about let me talk about goals. Let me talk about like like aesthetic goals.
00:18:16 I when I got into fitness when I was maybe like 20, around 20 or so, I, you know, I was like, man, I'm real ugly and I need to be less ugly.
00:18:29 And this is my only chance. So yeah, sure, sure it does.
00:18:34 But I think I don't say I don't actually think that matters anymore.
00:18:40 Like I really don't think that it makes much difference what you look like.
00:18:44 I'll tell you. I'll tell you what does make a difference, Ben.
00:18:47 I've said this a lot of times before, you know this to be true. It's the beard, dude. It's the fucking beard.
00:18:52 Okay. Yeah. Well, that's a whole separate issue.
00:18:54 Yeah. For me, your beard is iconic. It's fucking iconic.
00:18:59 The thing that everyone thinks about in their mind is the T-Bap Q&A Ben. That's the real thing.
00:19:05 I think most people probably think of the Chris Chan lecture, Ben, but I do think the beard, statistically, I do think the beard is a better look.
00:19:14 It's coming back.
00:19:15 You look like a fucking lumber. You, okay, both you and Nate, this is like a proven fact that everyone like knows you and Ben are appear in the T-Bap Q&A as the most beautiful people
00:19:28 to ever exist. Everyone in the community was like blown away at how you appeared in that video.
00:19:36 And we just look like normal people doing pony videos, you know.
00:19:40 You're so blown away because you were just normal.
00:19:43 I mean, yeah. That's what I thought at the time.
00:19:46 I had a real good-looking beard and I was wearing a very flattering outfit.
00:19:50 Yeah. You look like a lumberjack. You look like a lumberjack.
00:19:54 That was my shirt. I lent it my shirt for that.
00:19:56 No, no, that was my shirt. I got that in Poland.
00:19:58 Okay, maybe you're right. That's my favorite shirt.
00:20:01 It's like, you know, it's his shirt, but you took it from home.
00:20:06 No, no, that's all mine. That was all me.
00:20:10 Ben, you are wrong. That is my shirt that I lent. I'm looking at it right now. That was definitely-
00:20:17 Hang on.
00:20:18 Wait, I think, here, I've got it right here. I'm gonna link you.
00:20:21 This is the mystery that needs solving.
00:20:23 This must be solved.
00:20:24 I completely believe Nate Biasbett has a history of stealing Nate's clothes.
00:20:28 I did not steal those shoes.
00:20:30 Nate left them behind and I went home and I saw the shoes and I said,
00:20:37 are these Nate's? And mom said, Nate left them and said he didn't want them.
00:20:40 And I was like, well, they're cool, so I'll take-
00:20:42 Look, mom was misinformed, all right?
00:20:44 Yeah, misinformed.
00:20:45 And that's not my-
00:20:46 No, I'm looking. That's my shirt. That is my favorite shirt. I bought it in Poland.
00:20:50 I remember.
00:20:51 Okay, all right.
00:20:52 Maybe you're right.
00:20:53 It's not just his favorite shirt. It's not just his shirt yet.
00:20:55 Yeah, that's my-
00:20:56 It's his favorite-
00:20:57 I remember buying it and it was my favorite shirt ever since.
00:21:00 Okay, you might be right.
00:21:01 I'll kill you for this.
00:21:04 Link in the description to give me back my shirt from Ben.
00:21:09 I started starving Indiegogo for that.
00:21:13 Michael, I've always had-
00:21:15 Yeah, tell us about it.
00:21:16 Like a dream, but not a dream since it's something I want to actively work towards,
00:21:19 like, you know, drawing and stuff like that.
00:21:21 But it's one of those, like, side, like, nightmares that I have in my life
00:21:25 that just I hope I stumble into somehow,
00:21:28 but they're not my primary, like, motivating goal in life,
00:21:30 and just hopefully along the road to accomplishing my actual goals,
00:21:33 I will somehow become it.
00:21:35 I want to be a bear.
00:21:37 A big gay bear?
00:21:38 Yeah, a big gay bear, unironically.
00:21:40 Next.
00:21:41 That is my goal.
00:21:42 I want to be-
00:21:43 You're honestly most of the way there already.
00:21:45 I know, dude.
00:21:46 That's- that's-
00:21:47 Imagine, Matt.
00:21:48 Imagine me being like a daddy bar.
00:21:50 Like, it's so easy.
00:21:51 I basically am already doing it.
00:21:53 I already do that all the time.
00:21:55 You should be downloadable DLC for Dream Daddy.
00:21:58 You should-
00:21:59 What is that?
00:22:00 What is that?
00:22:01 It's actually true.
00:22:02 You can go after if you're looking out.
00:22:04 Let me know.
00:22:05 All you need to do much.
00:22:06 You probably don't need to change a thing about your life.
00:22:08 You just need to start powerlifting.
00:22:10 Yeah.
00:22:11 And probably just eat more food.
00:22:12 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:22:13 Probably eat more food.
00:22:14 Okay, here's the thing.
00:22:15 Eat more protein.
00:22:16 The thing about getting fit and getting swole.
00:22:19 Okay, because I'm all about simplicity.
00:22:21 I'm all about cut away needless complexity and just reduce it to most basic principles.
00:22:27 And I think that something that everyone could internalize and would be better off for it
00:22:32 is this idea that, okay, lifting does everything.
00:22:36 Because lifting-
00:22:38 Yeah, like you said, making no changes in your life.
00:22:41 If you just start lifting or lift more, you can eat all the same shit.
00:22:46 And you will simultaneously lose fat and gain muscle due to the calories being redirected
00:22:52 in your body, due to the new strains you were putting on it.
00:22:55 Oh, but Ben, after I exercise, I gotta go get myself a little treat.
00:22:58 I gotta go get myself a little treat every time I lift.
00:23:01 Gotta hit up Starbucks and get a couple of treats, if you know what I'm saying.
00:23:04 I mean-
00:23:05 That's just how I do it.
00:23:06 Sure, whatever.
00:23:07 And even if you do that, you'll still be better off if you're lifting.
00:23:10 I mean, you will be better off.
00:23:11 That's true.
00:23:12 My dream is to be a barred dad.
00:23:14 But I actually do have a real goal.
00:23:18 And it's not to become a fitness god.
00:23:20 But all I wanna do is just walk.
00:23:23 I wanna have a time in the day for like an hour where I just walk down my street.
00:23:27 Dude, you know who used to take spirited, portly walks?
00:23:30 Portly walks.
00:23:31 Benjamin Franklin.
00:23:32 Wait, did he call them portly walks?
00:23:35 Was it like his version of Winnie the Pooh's stoutness exercises?
00:23:41 Absolutely.
00:23:42 Absolutely.
00:23:43 That's exactly what it was.
00:23:44 Wait, wait, wait.
00:23:45 With Benjamin Franklin.
00:23:46 More like goutness exercises.
00:23:47 Oh, he couldn't walk at all.
00:23:48 Too soon.
00:23:49 Too soon.
00:23:50 Get on the ground, county father.
00:23:51 Get on the ground, county father.
00:23:52 Yeah, I just wanna take more walks and I wanna be able to like go outside more.
00:23:59 Because honestly, I think that's the most alluring thing about being fit.
00:24:02 It's just feeling like you're not dying constantly.
00:24:05 Pokemon go, dude.
00:24:06 Pokemon go.
00:24:07 I feel like I'm dying like maybe 32% of my life.
00:24:11 Oh.
00:24:12 I feel like I'm dying.
00:24:13 Wait.
00:24:14 That's not bad.
00:24:15 You feel like you're dying?
00:24:16 Yeah.
00:24:17 That much?
00:24:18 What do you, like, cause you feel really bad physically?
00:24:19 Is that the idea?
00:24:20 Yeah.
00:24:21 Okay.
00:24:22 All right, Monchi, I have the perfect remedy for you.
00:24:24 I will teach you the secret to becoming fit.
00:24:27 Are you ready?
00:24:28 Oh, shit.
00:24:29 Is it law of attraction?
00:24:30 I guarantee you it's law of attraction.
00:24:31 Law of attraction.
00:24:32 Is it punching trees with your hands?
00:24:35 Close.
00:24:36 Is it sitting under a waterfall?
00:24:37 No, let him sit.
00:24:38 No, I don't even give a shit what the real answer is.
00:24:43 Oh, man.
00:24:45 So, first off, you need to master the exercise that is a fit favorite.
00:24:51 It's called the fork put down.
00:24:53 And if you're able to do these for at least 15 repetitions for three sets, you're good.
00:25:00 Second of all, start an Instagram account for yourself.
00:25:04 And post your progress every single day.
00:25:07 Damn.
00:25:08 So that way, if you fail, it will live on forever in a government database long after you die.
00:25:13 So that is the ultimate motivation to keep going.
00:25:17 Third.
00:25:18 It is public ridicule.
00:25:20 Yeah.
00:25:21 Absolutely.
00:25:22 Absolutely.
00:25:23 Oh, God.
00:25:24 Well, third is just eat steroids.
00:25:26 Lots of them.
00:25:28 And you will make it.
00:25:30 Slurp them up.
00:25:31 Yep.
00:25:32 And that's it.
00:25:33 You know, I was going to have my daily Captain Crunch.
00:25:35 You know, I'm just going to pour some steroids on there for good measure.
00:25:38 Yeah, but for real though, having people around to hold you accountable is like one of the best things you can have.
00:25:44 Like exercise groups.
00:25:46 Like with most things.
00:25:47 Yeah.
00:25:48 Yes.
00:25:49 Totally true.
00:25:50 Because it's so easy to just like, even me.
00:25:53 Like I missed like two workouts this week, but I was like sick.
00:25:56 But like the week before, I like missed a day of exercising on like Monday or something.
00:26:00 And it was like, it's like, well, you know, like nobody's around.
00:26:02 I'm just going to, I can just go home and it won't be a problem.
00:26:05 It'll be fine.
00:26:06 It'll be fine.
00:26:07 And you know, like if someone was there being like, time to go.
00:26:09 All right, Nate.
00:26:10 Come on.
00:26:11 Let's let's fucking get to the gym.
00:26:12 I'd be like, all right, here we go.
00:26:13 And that would be a totally different atmosphere.
00:26:15 And I would like definitely go because like the worst thing for me about like the thing
00:26:19 that prevents me from like actually getting to the gym on days is that like when I'm at
00:26:23 work and I've, and I've dicked around too much during the day, but I have to stay late
00:26:27 to like catch up on the shit I've done.
00:26:29 And then I ended up getting late and I'm like, shit, I got to get home and get to work.
00:26:32 So I guess I'll skip the gym today.
00:26:34 So the solution to me to make sure I never miss a day at the gym is to literally just
00:26:40 have my life together and stick to my schedule so that I actually like fulfill all my commitments
00:26:45 so I can get there and not fuck everything up.
00:26:48 So I mean, it's just kind of like a total life change thing for me.
00:26:51 I don't want to like intimidate, intimidate people away from that thing and like, oh,
00:26:54 my whole life needs to change.
00:26:55 I'm just saying that like for me, that's, that's kind of my biggest hurdle.
00:27:00 Like I know what I'm doing now.
00:27:02 I just got to actually fucking get there to do it.
00:27:04 I don't have.
00:27:06 Oh, you got something to say.
00:27:08 You can see it.
00:27:09 Well, I was going to say, I know for a lot of people, like if you've never done fitness
00:27:13 before, you've never like gone to the gym, it can seem like it's intimidating.
00:27:17 What's cool about fitness is that there's tons of things you can do and not be in a
00:27:22 gym, like even just in your bedroom doing pushups, you know, planks, things like that.
00:27:27 Just to build up basic strength if you're feeling a little too insecure to go into the
00:27:31 gym.
00:27:32 You know, like there's still a lot of basic things you can do without ever stepping foot
00:27:36 in the gym.
00:27:37 So yeah.
00:27:38 And I know a lot of people.
00:27:39 Oh yeah, go on.
00:27:40 Something that has always been the problem with me, not just in terms of fitness, but
00:27:44 with everything.
00:27:45 Is this idea that like if it's not just so, then like fuck it.
00:27:48 So like if I'm on like a routine, like if I'm on like a three day a week, like lifting
00:27:54 routine and I get it and a day comes and like I can't get to the gym.
00:27:59 I'm not like, oh, well, I'll do pushups or cardio or something instead.
00:28:03 I'm just like, I can't do the thing.
00:28:05 Then fuck it.
00:28:06 It's ruined.
00:28:07 Throw it all in the garbage.
00:28:09 That could be a big problem.
00:28:11 Yeah.
00:28:12 Yeah.
00:28:13 And like the solution is either get over that or just like make absolutely sure that your
00:28:17 schedule never fucks up so that you don't have this adverse reaction due to your psychological
00:28:24 problems.
00:28:27 I've never had very much success regimenting like exercise for myself because of like one,
00:28:35 I don't eat that much anyway.
00:28:36 So I don't have like a weight loss problem.
00:28:39 I'm an average weight and it's all fine.
00:28:42 And also I don't really particularly care about getting swole.
00:28:45 So like the only reason I would do exercises because well, it's better than not doing exercise.
00:28:51 But it's always like, I tried it like a couple months, I tried getting up and having like
00:28:57 a doing some cardio or something before breakfast.
00:29:00 And it works a bit, but I keep falling out of favor with it.
00:29:05 And I feel like if I was, if I'm ever going to do like a real fitness thing, it would just
00:29:11 be because I am like doing something else that I also want to do, like learning to play
00:29:17 the drums properly.
00:29:18 Like playing the drums is like that's a pretty good thing to do.
00:29:22 So I feel like I'm not a fitness boy.
00:29:26 I feel like I'm a health boy.
00:29:28 I'm not a fitness boy.
00:29:29 I feel like there's a difference between the two.
00:29:31 Well, you know, that's fine.
00:29:32 But like what about, what about a goal like, and I don't know if you care about this, but
00:29:35 like I personally, I would like to, before I die, run a marathon.
00:29:39 That's a goal of mine.
00:29:40 That's a goal.
00:29:41 And you know, I know people who've gone from couch to marathon in six months, so it shouldn't
00:29:44 really take me that fucking long, but it's not a, it's not a huge priority for me right
00:29:47 now.
00:29:48 But what about like cardiovascular strength, like being able to run for a long time?
00:29:51 Like that's something that doesn't taste like super muscle.
00:29:53 I've always been pretty good at running.
00:29:55 My favorite thing, like my favorite physical thing to do is just climbing on rocks.
00:30:00 I don't, I don't particularly like, like.
00:30:02 Do they call that bouldering in England?
00:30:05 They call that in America too.
00:30:07 When I worked at AstroCamp, I knew a bunch of guys that really liked bouldering.
00:30:10 And in fact, I have with me right now a t-shirt from Boulder Fest, 2000, I don't know, 13
00:30:18 or whatever.
00:30:19 Yeah.
00:30:20 Are you going to BoulderCon this year?
00:30:21 Yeah.
00:30:22 It's just, we all went up to like a local mountain and just like clambered around on some
00:30:26 low rocks.
00:30:27 Yeah.
00:30:28 And they made t-shirts for it.
00:30:29 And it was Boulder Fest.
00:30:30 Just a group of about 20 or so guys just walking up to a cliff and you just know floundering
00:30:33 and just, you know, trying to climb up some rocks.
00:30:36 Like one guy just like puts his feet on a rock face and kind of like kind of kind of
00:30:40 crab walks to the left across it for a ways.
00:30:43 And you know, if he gets a little high, people hold a mattress under him.
00:30:46 There's a couple of guys with some rocks.
00:30:48 What could be better?
00:30:49 And that's bouldering.
00:30:50 Yeah.
00:30:51 I don't know whether I'd like go and with a group of people and do something like that.
00:30:56 But like, I enjoy climbing and getting up high.
00:30:59 So like climbing stairs, climbing up to the top of a big old rock, just being on a cliff,
00:31:05 not jumping off though.
00:31:08 These things, like climbing a tree, I would climb a tree just because.
00:31:12 But I wouldn't like regiment it.
00:31:13 I don't think I'm built for that sort of weirdness.
00:31:17 Just like a gibbon.
00:31:18 It's so weird.
00:31:19 Like a monkey gibbon, you know?
00:31:21 That's what they do.
00:31:22 They climb trees and they swing around.
00:31:24 That's it.
00:31:25 That's it.
00:31:26 That's all they do.
00:31:28 Pokemon Go, unironically, has been such an improvement on my life.
00:31:33 When I was in Boston, I've easily like walked like probably more than I ever have my entire
00:31:40 life just to get fucking Rayquaza.
00:31:44 That's all that I cared about during my time.
00:31:46 Dude, I fucking.
00:31:47 I had to get as many Rayquaza as humanly possible.
00:31:49 So I walked all fucking over town.
00:31:51 I walked from fucking Faniel Hall down to like the fucking Prudential Center, like over
00:31:56 and over again.
00:31:57 One time I did it like three times in one fucking day.
00:31:59 Damn.
00:32:00 Back and forth just fucking constantly.
00:32:02 Damn those fucking Pokemon.
00:32:04 Yeah.
00:32:05 It was great.
00:32:06 When Pokemon Go first started and I was really into it, I was the same.
00:32:10 I was like, oh, this is going to be great.
00:32:11 I really want to get out of the house and walk every day.
00:32:14 So I did for like months and it was great and I was catching Pokemon.
00:32:17 But then as Pokemon Go stopped being interesting to me for like, it was like, it got really
00:32:24 cold and I just didn't want to go out and it was bad.
00:32:28 I know actually I did go out quite a lot during the winter.
00:32:31 But like, it was just, it just lost, it fell out of favor with me.
00:32:35 And I also stopped wanting to go outside and I was like, damn, I really hoped that Pokemon
00:32:40 Go would just make me be like normal, like going outside and walking and being normal.
00:32:47 I need Pokemons like you take care of my body.
00:32:49 I need them.
00:32:50 Yeah.
00:32:51 I didn't want to rely on Pokemon Go because eventually it will stop being fun and then
00:32:56 I will start walking and it sucks.
00:32:58 Well, eventually the universe will burn out.
00:33:01 That I joined Pokemon Go when I did, well, rejoined it rather, is because I joined when
00:33:07 Raids were already an established thing and Raids are just fantastic.
00:33:13 They are just fucking beautiful.
00:33:15 For those of you who don't know, Raids are when a Pokemon will spawn at a gym and so
00:33:20 you have to take it down together as a group and you have to assemble a team, some sort
00:33:25 of dead squad if you will, to take down the various Pokemon that arise.
00:33:29 And so I'll just be walking, I'll walk like fucking like 10 kilometers one day trying
00:33:35 to find Rekweza eggs and then I'll come across some colorful characters if you will.
00:33:42 In Boston, I just found the craziest fucking people you will ever find playing Pokemon
00:33:49 not just like nerds, but like fathers and mothers and children and weird disabled people.
00:33:57 I've already told the story about the guy who said that everyone Pokemon loves the cock
00:34:02 and couldn't stop saying the phrase, yeah, this Pokemon loves the cock.
00:34:06 He just loves it.
00:34:07 It was this portly fat guy.
00:34:08 That guy, I found people like that all the time.
00:34:10 It was beautiful.
00:34:11 I love meeting urban freaks and Pokemon Go don't allow me to take care of my body, but also
00:34:18 allows me to see freaks and those are my two favorite pastimes is being alive and seeing
00:34:23 freaks.
00:34:24 I mean getting the exercise thing is definitely good because my fucking life is like in front
00:34:32 of a computer and then I go to the gym and like work out for a time and you know do some
00:34:37 time on the treadmill.
00:34:38 Then I come home and get back in the computer and like I don't feel like it's really
00:34:42 that good of a lifestyle like I should probably do way more cardio or spend like any time
00:34:47 outside.
00:34:48 So something like Pokemon Go is just that brings me to walk for like five minutes outside is
00:34:53 honestly a huge change of pace from what I like normally do in a day and just that in
00:34:59 itself I think is really good just to get some fucking sun because I'm the palest motherfucker
00:35:05 at the gym by far and also just to like explore my environment a little bit.
00:35:09 You know that's always nice just to I feel so I feel like such an internet denizen such
00:35:15 a citizen of the internet and like I have very little grounding in my physical environment
00:35:19 if you know what I mean and it's nice to it's nice to have a reason to fucking check that
00:35:24 shit out every once in a while.
00:35:26 I before Pokemon Go and when I got back home I started playing a lot but before that I
00:35:31 didn't really like know my area excruciatingly well like I didn't really like know downtown
00:35:37 San Diego that well but after like playing Pokemon Go for the past couple of weekends
00:35:41 like I've been doing I feel like I feel like local in the place that I live I feel like
00:35:45 I know my way around the city and it's just like culturally enriching I would call it
00:35:51 like it feels good to be a part of the world and inhabit it.
00:35:56 Community day I've gone to two now or I guess three and they've all just been complete joys
00:36:00 communities are it's a special day Pokemon Go each month where a special type of Pokemon
00:36:04 spawns extremely commonly and so I will go down to Bow Park which is just like a beautiful
00:36:09 section like like strip of like stores and museums it's absolutely beautiful I'll go
00:36:15 there and there will be crowds and crowds of people and it will just be fantastic be
00:36:19 able to see people there and just walk around back and forth catch Pokemon and talk to weird
00:36:24 freaks.
00:36:25 Also fun fact shout out to Brianna a fan that found me during last community day I was
00:36:31 doing a raid and then I turn around and there's someone who's like hey are you munchy I love
00:36:36 the procrastinators I what the fuck do you know it was great she found us through Unate

00:38:12 looks pretty funny he looks very fuck teeth okay let's seriously talk about if video games
00:38:19 have had any positive impact or coordination don't claim to be a musician unless you play
00:38:25 video games I mean I was gonna say that I feel like playing guitar does it better but
00:38:32 I also play a lot of video games so who knows which one influenced the other John Lydden
00:38:37 fucking Jimmy Hendricks get the fuck out of here I'm playing I mean if we're talking
00:38:43 about fitness and gaming I can't believe we haven't mentioned the all-time great for fitness
00:38:49 and video games DDR I was yeah DDR man there it is there it is didn't it used to like track
00:38:54 your calories burned or something yeah it was like a workout mode yeah I used to do that
00:39:00 Nate remember remember remember the good old days playing pretty damn good at DDR pretty
00:39:06 good DDR Max 2 DR Max 2 there were a couple of there were a couple of songs I'm trying
00:39:11 to remember a couple of a breakdown yeah and that's why I'm aesthetic of DDR and I
00:39:20 always want to fly those people that can just fucking go ham to my knowledge though I still
00:39:25 could a video game that you wouldn't think maximizes fitness and turns you into a health
00:39:31 God but I've learned does is VR chat I've been recently what listening to a lot of radio
00:39:38 pros that gets host by young Rikowski actor of Parker do 91 and one of the hosts he has
00:39:45 his name is Dewey and Dewey is this guy who goes on VR chat every night and gets so wasted
00:39:53 dancing and raving in the virtual weeks and like communicate with like serial killers that
00:39:59 sometimes he'll just like he'll like like pass out with the VR on after drinking so much then
00:40:05 just wake up and continue like raving all fucking wow this is like lost like five pounds just
00:40:13 just straight up raving in VR that's just all you fucking guys I mean with like dare reason like
00:40:20 in that sock members I mean the cool thing about VR is it does make you move your physical body
00:40:25 which is cool yeah yeah you've got an Oculus Rift I do I do and it is so close getting me one
00:40:33 two you were so close I was a couple a couple hundred a couple hundred more more dollars a
00:40:38 couple hundred more dollars and we could yeah yeah next time that would have been ready to be our
00:40:43 dude incredible Matt dude imagine imagine playing endless war in VR next base hey can you can you
00:40:54 play Minecraft in VR could you use the slime mod well I mean then fucking Lord of Ghosts
00:41:00 dude dude Lord of Ghosts slime in VR holy shit yes please I played with the texture pack you made
00:41:10 and but no not you made that one of the characters Lord of Ghosts is made not anyone here and it's
00:41:18 beautiful it's simply beautiful so wherever you are Lord of Ghosts thank you for the present and
00:41:23 incidentally we brought it back around to Minecraft I told you they were intricately like
00:41:27 this is one of the many connecting nodes that I've mapped out on my fucking red string chart
00:41:32 yes excellent let's talk about how school has ruined fitness forever and it's made great
00:41:39 think that running is evil yes I had I had a tweet a couple days ago because I just had this
00:41:45 thought about like how I'm sure a lot of people got turned off from taking care of their body
00:41:53 fitness ways because the only way you could do fitness at school is competitive sport and if
00:42:00 you're not on the winning team you feel like shit and so there's a lot of sports with with
00:42:07 fitness means that people who don't like playing tennis or football yeah end up not trying to
00:42:13 exercise it's also just the simple fact that it is a game like like sports are a game that you play
00:42:19 with like objectives outside of the fact of fitness being fit helps you play sports like you don't
00:42:25 play sports to get fit really yeah like don't get me wrong I understand I think the idea behind it
00:42:31 they're like ah we'll make it a game it will be fun because it's fun we'll basically be tricking
00:42:36 these kids into like being healthy and shit like that's like the logic behind it that's why like
00:42:41 we play like dodgeball and shit we're you know fucking young wherever you know that that's fucking
00:42:44 banned now or whatever but like yeah like in like we had health class and we had like Jim and these
00:42:51 were like totally separate Jim was just play some semi-fit games or like run around the track like
00:42:57 once or twice and it was like it was embarrassed it was like terrible and I hated it of course
00:43:01 everybody hated it and like health class I just learned that it was like an elective it was shit
00:43:07 it was embarrassment it was nothing we need to fucking teach people about fucking like what the
00:43:14 fuck is a calorie like how do you okay like fit was saying before about like the doing doing reps
00:43:19 of his favorite exercise the the fork put down the fork put down is a great exercise but I've got
00:43:25 one that I learned from my voice is that a gardening thing no you're shoveling soil around and then
00:43:31 you put down the fork you pick it back up move some more soil I'll get you fit I mean that's
00:43:36 that's true that's true but this is the exercise I'm thinking of it's the it's called the loaf
00:43:40 turnover and this works with it with a large variety of different instruments it's like when
00:43:45 you got a bread loaf before you put that motherfucker in your face you perform the loaf turnover and
00:43:51 you turn it over and you look at the fucking nutrition facts label on the back of the goddamn
00:43:57 thing before you eat it and so many people don't even know that like everything you need to know
00:44:03 for the most part like 99% of what you want to know about a food is just on the label how many
00:44:07 calories are in it like the amount of the grams of sugar that are in it like and and particularly
00:44:12 with the loaf turnover specifically like reading like white bread the thing is when you make bread
00:44:17 you use like only part of the grain to make like white bread that gets removed so that's just like
00:44:24 the pure white fluffy stuff but like what like whole wheat bread has way more like fiber and
00:44:29 actual vitamins and stuff that's actually good for you not just pure carbs so you want to eat
00:44:34 more of that shit and like if you turn over and you look at the ingredients and you see it says
00:44:38 100% whole wheat and it says 100% whole wheat in the ingredients and doesn't you know give
00:44:44 any bullshit then you know ah this is good like this is what I should be putting in my body
00:44:48 though I mean there's another case like bread is just like you should just not eat bread but the
00:44:52 one thing about food and calorie counting that I always hate is that I don't I don't care I would
00:44:59 rather like I would rather learn how to cook vegetables to make them tasty and then just eat
00:45:04 that because I know vegetables are just good and you should yeah I mean the simpler it is the
00:45:10 simpler the solution is the more people will actually do it that definitely makes sense it's
00:45:17 just like I you know since I've been sort of in this world for a while now like there's two
00:45:22 ways to approach it Scooby himself advocates like he advocates for like simple substitutions to make
00:45:28 it as easy as possible because he knows like realistically that's what people who are just
00:45:32 starting will be like willing to do like cut out soda just start drinking water like someone could
00:45:36 conceivably do that and like lose a bunch of weight and feel better about themselves oh but
00:45:41 like I mean you know it's tough but people can do it but like the real ultimate goal for everyone
00:45:47 in the world ultimately should be to like gauge their BMI know how many calories they need in a
00:45:54 day have a direct fitness goal count their calories count their macro nutrients and make sure
00:45:59 they're doing all this stuff correctly every day and like formulate their diet so that they're
00:46:03 getting what they need for their goals whatever those may be okay but that's a lot to ask of
00:46:07 people I mean some some goals can be quite vague you want to be like huge you want to be a big
00:46:14 huge boy with more less yeah yeah with big old muskles I don't like I don't particularly care
00:46:19 about having like a large mass I feel like I'd rather be a compact lad like you punch me but I'm
00:46:27 made of steel you know you want what you want what Michelle said you all Michelle describes as
00:46:33 lean muscle lean muscle she's always talking about it's like it's just like normal muscle only 10
00:46:38 times as dense and powerful she'll buy these like bullshit products it's so dense every single
00:46:44 ligament so many black hole you're so fucking dense I actually read this I read the series called
00:46:56 it's called it's like history's strongest warrior Kenichi or something it's this manga it got made
00:47:01 into an anime yeah like at the beginning of the series it's about a guy who goes from like a normie
00:47:07 he starts doing like fitness specifically to like learn karate to like defend himself from some
00:47:11 bullies or whatever I did escalate to whatever but like at first he's just a normal guy and he
00:47:15 wants to get ripped and like the guys of this dojo he stumbles upon like all huge and muscly but
00:47:20 like the guy who's training him is this like normal looking dude but then and so so he's like
00:47:24 following that guy's training regiment and he's not gaining any muscles like well dude what the
00:47:28 fuck I'm not like getting ripped what the hell but later on like turns out like that that that
00:47:35 normal looking guy like his shirt falls off and you can see he's just like super tight and his
00:47:39 muscles are glistening he just looks normal size he's like wait what and then Kenichi like
00:47:44 looks himself he's like wait I my muscles are so dense I've been developing lean muscle and they
00:47:49 describe like a different type of muscle that this guy has been cultivating that doesn't make any
00:47:53 fucking sense like this is like completely made up like slow twitch versus fast twitch muscle or
00:47:57 something I don't really think that's a real thing right there's like maybe they describe it as
00:48:05 pink muscle muscle confusion some muscle confusion stuff isn't that just some shit to like
00:48:13 develop like more power when you're like I mean I guess it makes sense the whole point was the
00:48:17 guys in 300 did they all did like muscle confusion workouts to like huge muscles not yeah well what
00:48:25 the fuck is muscle you do it different different exercises all the time so your body never gets
00:48:31 but that's just a way to build a muscle faster I think I think my body disoriented that's how
00:48:36 I mean kind of yeah but fit did you have a comment yeah the easiest way to see the comparison is
00:48:42 look at a sprinter versus a marathon runner like Usain Bolt is a sprinter and he is huge and then
00:48:50 if you look at a marathon runner most of their bodies actually look like shit aesthetically
00:48:56 there's a huge difference between muscles that are meant for endurance and then muscles that are
00:49:01 meant for explosiveness if you train your body for explosiveness you're gonna have more size but
00:49:07 if you're training for endurance you're not gonna have as much size and it's not going to be as
00:49:11 aesthetic yeah and when I play Dark Souls I put all my points into endurance so like I want to
00:49:18 roll more but all I'm saying is that this Kenichi guy was training to be a fighter so you want
00:49:23 explosive power he's not trying to be a marathon runner so I'm just saying it doesn't make any fucking
00:49:27 sense oh but I think later I think later he does the other type of muscle he has both he's like
00:49:33 later later on he gets huge this is just like his first regiment where he develops his like first
00:49:38 power base I didn't read it that far but I you know I've kept up every once in a while yep what
00:49:45 one of my side nightmares that I hope I still want to which will help like accommodate me also be
00:49:51 coming a bear is I want to become a world-class chef and have seven restaurants exactly okay
00:49:57 extremely obtainable as a side one of my seven Cooper hotels I just want to be able to like cook
00:50:05 like real fucking food and like not not have to rely on like like going to like I don't go to fast
00:50:13 food ever really but I don't want to have to become you know rely on like restaurants or anything
00:50:17 I want to be able to like know my real shit be able to like cook actual real like you know like
00:50:22 vegetable fried rice and real shit in the comfort of my own home I think that's extremely desirable
00:50:27 and that would be yeah totally becoming like a health boys but not like relying on I have to
00:50:32 like get shit I can just make shit myself that's definitely a great thing to do I've like I've
00:50:38 wanted to do that I'm honestly just like too lazy to put in the time to do it I've been like I've
00:50:43 been ordering a lot from like Grubhub and stuff and like I generally aim towards healthier meals
00:50:47 you know like getting like grilled chicken instead of like fried and stuff and stuff along those
00:50:52 lines just very simple stuff and I have a lot I take a lot of like protein powder and stuff throughout
00:50:57 the day and yeah cooking is easiest to like get into the habit of knowing your way around a
00:51:04 kitchen by doing your own breakfast when you're really sleepy because you're so sleepy you can't
00:51:11 you can't decide you can't think to yourself ah fuck it you're so sleepy you can't even do that
00:51:16 you're just sort of like okay put that there but a crack an egg smash you know you're just sort of
00:51:22 like and then before you know it something goes on a plate and you better eat it and if it's bad
00:51:27 you better do it good next time so you're making a lot of breakfasts quite good that's that's that's
00:51:33 good but what by doing it when you're like sleepy you you just do it and you don't even have the
00:51:38 energy to question yourself you just go through the motions okay okay a lot of it too is that if you
00:51:45 have food in your house that is readily available to eat like without preparation you're more likely
00:51:50 to eat that so if you keep materials in your fridge that you have to prepare mm-hmm you you're
00:51:57 pretty much guaranteed that you're gonna start cooking a lot more often like many times when I
00:52:00 go shopping I'll get like tons of eggs tons of uncooked meats and stuff like that and when I have
00:52:06 that in the fridge I'm more likely to cook than I am to like you know eat a cookie or something like
00:52:11 that yeah having like a bag of chips around is a dangerous game when you are trying to like get
00:52:18 yourself into cooking more and you know like get yourself focused on like you want to be in an
00:52:24 environment surrounded by the kind of food you want to eat because if that's all that's around
00:52:27 that's all you're gonna eat and as long as you you know it's totally totally great point and I'm
00:52:32 gonna rant a little bit here one thing that is a huge contributor to obesity especially in American
00:52:38 society is that a lot of people don't realize they're drinking their calories because it is if you
00:52:44 look at obesity cases it is almost impossible to get that fat just eating food alone yeah if you're
00:52:52 drinking a lot of those calories okay yeah drinking the calories is a thing that I realized
00:52:58 that I like I was totally willing to give up drinking calories because like I don't mind the
00:53:04 taste of like diet drinks so like I know that they've got their own problems and their own
00:53:08 their own health issues associated with them but I never ever drink calories I've switched
00:53:13 entirely to diet soda I think the people who are like I think the people who think diet soda is
00:53:18 gross are idiots and I hate them that's all I have to say about that like why why why would you
00:53:24 drink your calories because they honestly this is not to be me it's just people just don't think
00:53:29 about it they just this is not like in their consciousness to like worry about what they're
00:53:34 consuming people need to be so much more conscious about what they put inside themselves and like I
00:53:39 really think that is the issue for we need from cradle to fucking grave we need a complete revolution
00:53:45 in like I don't know like for if you live in like uh like Greece or or Japan or someone like
00:53:50 Mediterranean or like coastal like oceanic places like those guys don't have obesity problems
00:53:55 because the food that's around is just like the Mediterranean diet is well known to be like one
00:53:59 of the healthiest in the world and then Japan itself they eat a lot of fish they eat a lot of
00:54:02 they eat rice but not that much but they have a lot of like different things to choose from
00:54:06 it's just the environment they're in sort of enables them to just like make smart choices because
00:54:12 that's just what's available but in America like what's been made available to us is just
00:54:17 endless calories in every form you can imagine like the fast food stuff we've got
00:54:22 the kind of drinks we have the huge you know mega ultra gulps those are all the problem
00:54:27 because like and they say like well a person just needs to choose and like you know make
00:54:32 smart decisions the problem just is that people didn't grow up knowing that they're gonna make
00:54:37 these kind of mistakes and and and how to properly take care of their bodies and like it's like a
00:54:42 fucking it's like a fucking adult gauntlet to go through learning how to eat right once you're
00:54:47 like fucking 20 you start figuring that shit out when like you're in danger of your metabolism
00:54:51 starting to slow down and then you start to get fat and shit and a lot of people just never figure
00:54:55 it out and that's led to the world we're in right now it's fucked up and we just need to yeah yeah
00:54:59 go on i'll just say a huge part of it too is socioeconomic a lot of the cheapest foods are some
00:55:05 of the most unhealthy and it's a huge problem a lot of families and poverty and stuff like if
00:55:11 they're only feeding their kids like really cheaply made food and you know that's there's a reason
00:55:17 why child obesity is a problem it's because these kids are being fed by their parents and it's shit
00:55:22 food you know what's weird is that a lot of the time i find that like ready meals and easy to
00:55:29 you know really cheap shit is not actually as cheap as just buying a thing of rice and some kidney
00:55:36 beans or whatever and making like a yeah a curry that's so it's it can feed you for so much more
00:55:42 the problem is but nobody nobody really knows because they're like i don't know i don't know how
00:55:47 to put it together exactly that's exactly that's the money is ignorant on it yep so they just aren't
00:55:52 like if you buy like a huge bag of rice that'll you'll just like scoop out of for a month i guarantee
00:55:58 that will be like a million times cheaper than like buying fast food every day or whatever uh
00:56:03 yeah there's no doubt yeah you know there's one thing there's one thing that i've learned and
00:56:07 i don't know i i saw i i kind of take it for granted that uh my parents have so many nice
00:56:12 glasses that are made of glass but like i drink water all the time and i'm not really a soda boy
00:56:19 and i think it's because i don't drink out of plastic cups plastic makes water taste like
00:56:25 shit if you have like glasses that you drink water out of they actually taste better it tastes juicy
00:56:31 i would encourage people to drink water out of glasses even tap water right so something about
00:56:36 the lip touchery is like it makes it nicer to drink and then you will drink more water if you
00:56:42 have nice glasses substituting water for just whatever the fuck people are drinking right now
00:56:47 would just do so much to to help this issue uh yeah that that would be great i drink mostly
00:56:54 water these days and then just water mixed with like protein powder and shit what this goes back
00:56:59 to is my famous legendary vlog watery advice keep bringing that up because it's the most influential
00:57:07 thing ever created it's inspired a generation uh it's just it's just a brain blast but you filmed
00:57:15 it yeah it is exactly it's just a brain blast i had it it's like showering feels really good
00:57:24 and that's and that's how i feel about about like like uh eating well and like working out and stuff
00:57:30 is that like you don't want to do it because like like in the moment while you're doing it it might
00:57:35 not like feel like incredible but afterward and even a lot of times during it it will feel great i
00:57:41 know whenever i take a walk and you know i do i do good health stuff and i cook my own meal and stuff
00:57:47 it feels empowering and it feels like i've just i've just fucking i've done it i've reached godly
00:57:52 status and i've walked a mile and you know i've done it i've defeated health that's exactly right
00:57:59 munchie it's it's so like like a lot of people will be turned off by it but like you really have to
00:58:04 like push through it and once you're done with it i guarantee it will be worth it and you will feel
00:58:11 like you've accomplished something there is one concept that separates us from the animals
00:58:15 now set it before but it is delayed gratification delayed gratification is the entire reason why
00:58:21 humans have gotten to the place we're at right now because we were willing to put an effort in
00:58:25 the short term uh to get greater results in the long term that's how we started farming way back
00:58:30 in the day yeah go on it's not even like directly like yes like i i've done this you know hard thing
00:58:38 but i will be rewarded later because i will be thinner it just i will wait wait wait i will be
00:58:43 rewarded by the lord of light there we go everyone yeah nice good it's just like almost immediately
00:58:51 after eating good food especially stuff like broccoli right it feels good it broccoli i don't
00:58:59 even like you're a good person if that's true it does but i don't even mean long term isn't like
00:59:04 you know in a year you'll feel better i mean that like when you're in the when you're in the planning
00:59:08 stages of like what am i gonna eat i've got like i've got some food in my fridge i could cook
00:59:13 or i could order i hop pancakes never delivered here i got these two choices and like the easy
00:59:20 way is just like order that shit but we all know the right answer instantly i ordered pancakes from
00:59:26 i hop not yesterday but the day before that's just because i like it's not even it is barbaric
00:59:31 it's not even a health thing it's just like a it's like an i hop pancake why are you doing this
00:59:36 okay there my my my pitiful excuse that i would never accept from anyone was just that i felt sick
00:59:41 and wanted pancakes that's my that's my excuse it's fucking i i hop is like the worst i did get
00:59:47 chicken fried steak i got chicken fried steak with southern gravy that was nice no no you need a
00:59:53 chicken broth you need it you need a soups you're right oh my god okay this is slightly off topic
00:59:58 but it's related to pokemon go one of my rituals after playing the game every uh sunday it was
01:00:05 i'll go to this like local ramen place and ramen has quickly become like my favorite food
01:00:11 ramen is the best food it's so good not like like top ramen shit which i do in fact love going to
01:00:17 like a real place yeah you get that fucking half an egg just floating in there and the naruto in
01:00:22 there and shit for the month of hell yeah there there was like a specialty ramen that it was like
01:00:28 mexican ramen that had like carnitas and stuff in it and then like and like chives and stuff and it
01:00:33 was fucking it was spicy delicious fucking ramen ten out of ten eat it every day and uh just a
01:00:40 ramen does have a pretty high density of calories what with the what with the noodles and all but
01:00:45 but you get a lot of good shit in there as well well not if not if you eat uh not if you eat that
01:00:49 ramen from the world ends with you or they just put an entire steak on top of it that's an entire
01:00:55 what an entire remember world ends with you there was that like yeah there was the mom and pop ramen
01:00:59 shop and then there was like the big trendy chain ramen place and like they went to check out the
01:01:04 big trendy chain that was putting the mom and pop rock try saying mom and pop ramen shop five times
01:01:09 fast and and they were like holy shit they just put an entire steak on top of the ramen bowl
01:01:15 um oh a steak a steak yeah yeah that's right that's right awesome yeah that's pretty fucking
01:01:21 I can see why mom and pop are obsolete frankly frankly out with the old and with the new
01:01:29 excellent all right guys let's let's let's veer towards our conclusion here we've been going for
01:01:33 about an hour uh what what are the what are the important messages you want people to take away
01:01:38 from our little discussion here walk outside you'll be happy like you will be happy I guarantee you
01:01:42 walk to like your local like you know church go and pray like a good christian man should I would
01:01:50 take a walk if you're listening to this and you're not a fit boy and you want to get you want to
01:01:54 be a fit boy take a walk today you know fucking what today okay new fucking hashtag PCP fit life
01:02:03 whatever there's a new PCP you want to be an ubermensch listen to the PCP while taking a walk
01:02:10 or go into the gym and take a selfie and I will retreat you from the PCP account on twitter the
01:02:16 PCP will retweet you if you take like a selfie and you're in the gym while watching to the latest
01:02:20 PCP take this journey with us that sounds good it sounds good yeah let's do yeah we'll do that
01:02:27 hashtag PCP fit life was that was that it or was it fitness life yeah we can go with something more
01:02:31 catchy probably I like okay hashtag PCP fit life fucking send us that shit and we will look at it
01:02:40 and we'll retweet it from the twitter there you go PCP fit hard oh christ we're making this hard
01:02:48 I don't understand anything uh delete something something like that
01:02:55 uh do it fucking do it okay does anyone else have a final resting place they would I do yeah
01:03:01 basically the nice part about fitness is that it makes you better at everything literally
01:03:08 everything thinking moving around lifting up household objects going from point A to point B
01:03:15 it's one of those things where it's like there's no logical reason not to do it unless you're
01:03:21 trying to get the world record for world's fattest man other than that though like it's one of those
01:03:26 things where even if you're not an athlete it's still important to maintain a basic level like
01:03:31 because it just like I said it makes you better at everything so why not do it that's actually true
01:03:35 just like like there there have been times in my life where I've been like somewhat normal and not
01:03:40 the monster that that stands before me today and it just like feels better to be alive it feels like
01:03:46 like it's like after like you know I do something healthy it just feels good to just sit back down
01:03:52 your computer and just breathe in that that good air with your with your good spartan lungs I often
01:03:57 think about it like this like think about the human beings that we are descended from you know
01:04:01 they were out fucking running around every single day and if you're literally just sitting in front
01:04:06 of a computer every day you're probably doing something wrong you're not doing what your body
01:04:11 requires to to operate at maximum capacity so don't think fitness is not an option fitness is not
01:04:18 an optional thing that you can maybe do if you want to get super rips everyone should exercise in some
01:04:24 capacity you should do it every single day even I don't do it every single day but we all should
01:04:29 do it every day that is the ideal and that is what we should all be shooting to be doing and if
01:04:34 you're not I think yeah I mean you know you're fucking up a little bit you're fucking up I think
01:04:39 if if people have like a difficulty just try and add on try and do something that you wanted to do
01:04:46 that just so happens to be physical like if you want to get better you want to level up pokemon
01:04:51 go you can go for more walks that's a very easy one if you have a dog you can walk the dog and do
01:04:56 you know that that's exercising itself if you want you know you could do an instrument or you
01:05:01 know a plan of drums would get you a lot of a lot of movement you know just pick a hobby that is
01:05:07 like collaterally exercising you if you can't like share the thought of just going and and doing it
01:05:13 by itself I know this advice might seem somewhat shallow especially coming from me because obviously
01:05:19 I I'm preaching and not doing but I genuinely do like like have a lot of respect for people who
01:05:26 do fitness because it is just a like a real good and it's it takes it's a massive undertaking to
01:05:31 you know do it consistently and become a fitness ubermensch and it's really inspiring and great
01:05:37 I'm not going to change anything in my life basically but uh good it's good well it's not
01:05:42 important to be an ubermensch it's so it's it's enough because like that that was the thing with
01:05:46 the the whole competitive like nature of like school is like oh if you're not the most fit then
01:05:52 what are you even doing like it's not important to be the biggest boy it's just important to be
01:05:58 not a piece of shit exactly right uh-huh also one more thing I want to add is that a lot of people
01:06:05 they don't want to change their diet or their exercise because they want to wait until it's
01:06:09 like a convenient time in their lives to do it but there is never a convenient time you are dying
01:06:15 right now that's the good point the first best time to get started was yesterday but the second
01:06:21 best time is right now yeah that that is the most important thing begin immediately uh just
01:06:26 like I say in my like me a math of a shit it's like like if you're inspired by something if you
01:06:31 just if you realize there's something you should have been doing all along the time to start immediately
01:06:35 not tomorrow not the next day just you know in whatever capacity you can begin looking into a
01:06:40 take that walk take that walk right now start lifting your mindset episode go right now get
01:06:47 your fucking heart or no nine guys there goes to do it and then listen to this while you walk
01:06:52 you know or whatever you want to do yeah listen you'll probably be listening for a half no you'll
01:06:56 take a half an hour walk probably if you listen to the end of this or give or take and you'll be
01:07:00 so happy that you did I guarantee while we uh while we answer our fucking pity questions and our
01:07:05 pcp patron line questions right are we are we wrapping up are we are we headed in the in that
01:07:09 direction I think we're wrapping up I think so I think so good you are a god hashtag pcp fit life
01:07:17 that's the one hashtag pcp fit life send us pictures you update us under shit we will retweet
01:07:21 them also suggestions for better names we will come up with a better name next week I like that
01:07:27 that's pretty good but whatever okay fair enough if it sticks then it'll stick uh all right let's
01:07:32 see what we got here questions from the twitter hashtag ask pcp pity questions um okay let me see
01:07:41 what we got here good questions seems like an oxymoron yeah well I mean fair enough fair enough
01:07:48 uh okay here we go here we go at chemotherapy chemotherapy asks uh do you think that all
01:07:54 criticism needs to be somewhat constructive to have any value or merit no well depends on what
01:08:01 they mean by constructive if they mean nice then of course not but if they mean like yeah there's
01:08:07 like like you when I hear constructive I just mean I can get something out of it I yeah I pretty much
01:08:13 I don't think like criticism okay constructive criticism is valuable to the creator theoretically
01:08:18 I don't think yeah that it needs to be valuable to the creator to be worth saying or worthwhile I
01:08:25 I agree I think sure I think most criticism is constructive like the only thing that would be
01:08:31 like unconstructive is like somebody complaining about something that isn't even true basically
01:08:37 basically but even but even that is like well there's they clearly had uh a misinterpretation
01:08:43 there's maybe not as clear as as you thought it was like that's a problem what if what if I you
01:08:47 know I'm watching one of your dark soul streams and I see you make a mistake and I have a thought
01:08:51 it's like well okay you should probably improve your skills and just for for for shorthand I say
01:08:56 that you should probably just you know get good that would be a positive change what do you know
01:09:02 what if I'm what if I'm waiting I'm I'm clicking f5 I'm refreshing day in day out just waiting on
01:09:09 the hypocrite channel for that fabled video series to find right you promised you promised
01:09:16 you for months now it's too late we believe that you promised me to finally grace our presence
01:09:25 it's been long enough
01:09:29 I'm dying I need it well most most constructive most comments that are criticizing they have
01:09:39 like I mean people want to sound like the smart guys so they will make an explanation so like this
01:09:45 is what I don't like about this even if they're completely wrong and they just misinterpreted it
01:09:49 that's still like I mean you can never be perfect you can never communicate as we as we know that
01:09:55 language doesn't work you can ever communicate perfectly to everybody so people will always miss
01:10:00 miss certain things but there's always some way to improve the ability to explain what your point is
01:10:08 in a way that less people will get confused so I think most criticism is constructive in that way
01:10:13 I feel like okay okay criticism can come in a lot of ways I feel like if you are leaving a comment
01:10:21 on a video on YouTube for example to be practical I feel like you I wouldn't I don't know if I want
01:10:27 to use the word oh it but I feel like you should probably have some sort of constructive criticism
01:10:33 in the sense that you at least like tell the person why something's bad I feel like an example of
01:10:38 like a comment that's not good is you suck die but it yeah a comment that could be great is you suck
01:10:43 die uh that to pay looks fake well you know what you know what I actually kind of what I'm explaining
01:10:49 why you should die I kind of want to go back on that a little because I actually I am I consider
01:10:55 myself a super charitable person in terms of like what other people say if someone comments on a video
01:10:59 of mine you suck die remind I mean of course I'll I'll probably be just like oh my feelings but
01:11:05 beyond that I'll think like okay why did this person say that and most likely I probably put
01:11:11 something in a video that was like controversial or whatnot so and like you can look at it and just
01:11:16 be like well okay this person is just expressing negative they're not being specific but we know
01:11:19 that they said that for some reason unless we're like a pure troll I want to yeah but if we can
01:11:25 just like if everyone's given you shit for like one thing you did wrong in a video let's say uh
01:11:30 and you like you're aware that it could have been like a hot button issue and you get a comment
01:11:34 like that then you could you could possibly charitably interpret that to be like uh here is yet
01:11:38 another voice criticizing me for doing this thing well yeah yeah you don't you you have to understand
01:11:44 the context yeah like yeah why the right thing but I think people do owe it to themselves to explain
01:11:51 themselves because if they don't explain themselves there's a chance that the person they're talking
01:11:55 to will never understand very true very true I'm not asking for a lot here I don't want to like
01:12:01 here's what you did wrong here's what can be better like listen to my essay just like any indication
01:12:06 of why I suck and should die is good enough just like tell me why a video yeah all right all right
01:12:12 people can't read minds I mean sometimes people have a criticism that's like uh I don't know like
01:12:17 like fit here has gotten criticism for just like uh people just straight up and make a video yeah
01:12:23 I mean just as one example not that I agree of course but people have like criticized you for
01:12:28 like exposing 2b2t to like the normos and that you know there's kind of just criticizing you on a
01:12:34 fundamental concept like what you're doing but there's just a straight up disagreement on how like
01:12:39 of course your big video about how um you know you're being uh exposing uh so I forget the name
01:12:44 of the guy who owns the server whatever house yeah yeah that one that was so cool that was an intense
01:12:49 fucking video I loved it but like so you I mean your your stuff like saved the server by by just
01:12:54 bringing attention to it so of course if you were one of those like five people who was like playing
01:12:59 2b2t back in those days and you know like you were like yay my secret club I love having like
01:13:05 one other person online sometimes and of course now things have changed like oh look at these
01:13:10 fucking you know noobs all showing up I could get why they wouldn't like that but you just have a
01:13:14 fundamental different approach you're trying to like resuscitate a community here so that's a very
01:13:18 fundamental disagreement in like intentions here so like that that criticism could be very like
01:13:25 honest they could say it in a helpful way but if you just fundamentally disagree on the premise
01:13:30 of their criticism then like frankly there's not a lot to take from it other than ah there are people
01:13:35 who have a descending opinion on this thing uh-huh absolutely a lot of times too like when there is
01:13:40 a criticism in that regard like oh you're exposing our server to the masses like I understand
01:13:46 their genuine concern like they wanted their secret little club you know I totally get it so
01:13:51 it's like I I sympathize with your situation but sadly I disagree with you that's that's what it
01:13:58 comes down to what a great question this was actually really nice thank you froggy sleuth aka
01:14:03 at chemo therapy nice job nice job the other ones are all bad wait wait I forgot at never paint
01:14:11 what's your favorite type of dinosaur not bad not bad the water you from Jurassic Park alive
01:14:18 TM Jurassic Park trademarked that's the end moving on my favorite investigator
01:14:26 he's brother to dinosaurs he's descended okay let's go to the uh alligators represent hey
01:14:32 everybody patreon.com slash patreon.com slash the procrastinators get yourself into the questions
01:14:40 bar on our discord server so we'll actually read your question so it's not a pity question a mere
01:14:45 pity question uh let's see what we got you got any picked out peeps I'm still looking a lot of them
01:14:52 are either like essays or like what's your favorite anime tier uh okay okay here's the example of what
01:14:58 we're getting here from zan what's your what what is your favorite healthy fat like they're so like
01:15:07 okay oh uh what is that I got one I got one I got one I got one I got one I gotta get those omega
01:15:11 sixes yeah well there's uh there so so fats are broken into a couple different kinds there are there
01:15:16 are saturated fats and there are unsaturated fats then you've got poly unsaturated fats and you've
01:15:20 got mono unsaturated fats you want the poly unsaturated fats are statistically speaking the most
01:15:27 quote unquote healthy because what makes it a poly unsaturated is that so the way that a the way
01:15:32 that a try glyceride which is what a fat molecule is the way it works is that it's got this string
01:15:38 of like I think they're carbon atoms with lots of like hydrogens attached to the carbons off the
01:15:43 side and what makes it an a saturated molecule is that when every possible link that has a hydrogen
01:15:50 attacks to those carbon atoms is there it is saturated that it's got as much mass as possible
01:15:55 but you can have a covalent double bond between carbon atoms that use up some of those possible
01:16:01 links that could otherwise be attached to hydrogen atoms and so when you have like if you have that
01:16:07 same molecule that just has lost a bunch of those hydrogens and you have like connections between
01:16:11 those carbon atoms then it just has less mass because a lot of those hydrogen atoms are just
01:16:17 missing and so it's like a lighter molecule than you'd otherwise have um and so uh so if you have
01:16:23 a mono unsaturated that means a single hydrogen is missing which means it's a little bit lighter
01:16:27 but if you have a poly unsaturated triglyceride that is a fat molecule that has is missing a whole
01:16:32 at least two and probably more hydrogen atoms therefore it's it's less and the the good thing
01:16:37 about those is those can absorb wayward hydrogen atoms in your digestive system which actually is
01:16:43 a is a helpful healthy like cleansing mechanism because those extra hydrogen atoms hanging out
01:16:48 in your gut can be negative for health and they they can like cause cancer and like can fuck up
01:16:51 shit um uh so i'm gonna go with poly unsaturated triglyceride it's all it's all about those omega
01:16:59 six is all about them fish oil pills it's all about those fish birds you know by the way an omega
01:17:04 six uh what what an omega six means if i remember remember correctly is the omega refers to like
01:17:10 a particular like end of the of the one of the molecules on the triglyceride and the six like
01:17:16 is the number like from that end so i think if i remember correctly i think it omega six means
01:17:20 like from the omega end of one of the strands of the carbon atoms like six down there is a missing
01:17:27 carbon atom there and that's why like it counts up to that and like that's like good or something
01:17:31 it's something along those lines it's about which like hydrogen atoms missing and it's healthier
01:17:36 so there you go and that's why they're good because they clean up stray hydrogen atoms in your body
01:17:40 couple from picture loan asks are there any foods that are objectively horrible should be avoided at
01:17:45 all costs soda obviously is one soda is a big one so does a big one um what else is there uh you
01:17:52 know i've actually been struggling because my favorite thing to consume in this world is orange
01:17:57 juice orange juice yeah the thing is orange juice is terrifically calorie dense uh and it's isn't it
01:18:05 good for digestion i mean fiber in it well it depends on your goals actually the thing about
01:18:10 the thing about orange juice is that you you miss out on tons excuse me tons of fiber you would
01:18:15 have gotten if you just eaten an orange so well true they always say that uh when it comes to
01:18:19 vegetables drink your vegetables eat your fruits is the common thing they say because drinking fruit
01:18:25 juice has a lot of calories and will you know make you fat whereas drinking vegetables like
01:18:29 vegetables have way less calories and you get all like the the vitamins and stuff from a vegetable
01:18:33 i've been drinking it so uh feel free to drink your vegetables and uh eat your eat your fruits
01:18:38 everybody yeah so i've been cutting it down yeah yeah go on i was gonna say orange juice it has
01:18:42 so much sugar in it and a lot of people think that oh it's a natural sugar so it's okay for me well
01:18:52 i mean sugar comes from sugar cane it's natural ben you've been typing this entire
01:18:57 fucking episode oh what the hell are you guys can you guys can hear that i've been hearing it the
01:19:02 astronauts on the space station gonna hear that fucking keyboard been uh yeah all right we'll edit
01:19:08 that out later well all right i should say so all right great um except for this one to make the
01:19:16 joke work uh chill wise been from the page yeah yeah what are you doing this is i'm extremely
01:19:23 interested in best workout mix like vapor music yeah music no no no you can't not vapor
01:19:31 anything you need something to pump you up uh for me it's various anime openings that get me hyped
01:19:37 and and that's pretty much what it is s cascade is mine but that's when it all comes tumbling down
01:19:44 uh whenever i take off or land on an airplane i always time it so that i like the little intro
01:19:53 starts in cascade i always try to time like everything in my life to be in line with cascade
01:20:00 my only travels on 413 i'm a big fan of uh sabaton while hitting my dick with a hammer
01:20:07 because it fills manliness that's gonna release so much testosterone into your system by doing
01:20:16 that yeah that's that's you know we've been beating around the bush steroids don't bother just hit
01:20:21 your dick with a hammer that you're really cutting out the middle man you need a joke you need a
01:20:25 fucking joke there's no activity more beneficial to muscle gain than jelking that's for sure dude
01:20:31 i'm the only muscle that matters that's my resolution to jelk hardcore yeah to jelk so hard
01:20:39 that i elevate off the floor 30 feet it's gonna be like like i'm gonna like like i'm gonna like
01:20:45 pull up next gonna be like such gravity with my hand that i'm going to like like i just like
01:20:49 jump up without having to move any of my muscles next yeah next to the olympic clean and jerk
01:20:54 is the equally renowned olympic jelk
01:21:01 incredible oh excellent hey uh yellow poon asks uh have you guys seen pain and gain if so then
01:21:08 how do you feel about the workout slash gym bro culture presented in movies now so pain and gain
01:21:13 is like uh is like a muscle head kind of movie those guys become murderers and like go off the
01:21:19 fucking rails so like this is a bit of an extreme example but a little bit a little like everything
01:21:26 was great about pain and gain until they started murdering people uh like things are going really
01:21:31 well i mean i think it improved okay fair enough but like there's a there's a spirit of camaraderie
01:21:39 of brotherhood that that's nice with like gym buddies and whatnot and uh i can appreciate that
01:21:44 spirit of unity and solidarity like like in pre-world war two germany you know everyone was
01:21:50 really getting on board yeah we were weeding out the week and uh preserving the strong
01:21:58 we were what Nate says oh uh i did some time in venezuela i moved here recently um yeah yeah uh i
01:22:05 don't know i gym bro culture is kind of stereotypicalized and gets a bad rap but like i i don't know
01:22:13 like there's a lot of quote-unquote gym bros like at the gym i go to but they're just like
01:22:17 nice guys who like work normal blue collar jobs and then love working out and hanging out with
01:22:23 each other and like this is like the demon of gym bro culture like guys having goals achieving them
01:22:29 and feeling good about themselves oh no what a nightmare just because a lot of movie directors
01:22:33 are fucking nerds yeah they're bunch of fucking fucking 98 pounds soaking wet twink-ass hollywood
01:22:38 directors definitely true that's right that's right so they're like a fucking
01:22:42 Chad stole Veronica from me in sixth grade i have you know you know even Steven Spielberg
01:22:47 really needs to to hit the gym you know who smashes the post you know who gets all the girls
01:22:53 and lifts 5 000 pounds a day my hero sam hide and just like him i i persevere on my path towards
01:23:03 greatness that's right that's right um all right like i i think we're pretty good at questions
01:23:10 though there is one other section i wanted to do which is our fan art appreciation section
01:23:14 oh that we're we're making a thing is this new do we now this is a new thing that's right that's
01:23:19 it's a new thing now this will be brief there's there's not a lot to go through but there's
01:23:22 keep this keep this brief i don't i don't want the yeah we don't i love i love it i love it i
01:23:28 can't believe the pcb is ripping off right for us by having fan art yeah i know i'm looking at
01:23:35 all things yeah now now here's a great one i love this this comes from our boy dino spinach
01:23:40 now let me post this in the chat here take a look at this masterpiece this is a color
01:23:48 profile selector i i'm gonna be honest with you this this has been like a common rebuttal to
01:23:55 mean bends you know talking in the reference cop killers episode about pcb colors and this approach
01:24:01 of two colors makes no sense no it's no i don't agree it makes perfect no sense it makes okay
01:24:08 why i think the two colors the rowdy fuckers house is divided therefore it's invalidated okay i i think
01:24:14 yeah i don't know this is great and i like it because mine is the best um and that's all there is to
01:24:19 it um you look like a delicious black i guess my one problem is that hippo and debu are too similar
01:24:26 i i think the concept of having two colors is okay i just think most of these choices are kind of
01:24:31 bad especially mine which looks like shit um i guess what what what's sensitive you know yeah i
01:24:36 think this person took the like like yours only makes sense with that avatar which like you know
01:24:42 you get a couple of these i would i wouldn't fully agree with like i mean i love mine i love mine i think
01:24:48 that yours is i would give you but like the entire the entire well okay i don't like your
01:24:56 because your color scheme there is the rowdy fucking color scheme well well muchy we're talking
01:25:00 primary and secondary color so everyone has their primary color and then there's also a secondary
01:25:05 color used for it i don't fucking know whatever it doesn't matter yeah whatever you wish whatever
01:25:11 you please i don't understand why what is not hard to understand i don't there's no
01:25:18 point to me there's no point to me there's no point to you get it why don't we actually do our
01:25:24 buddy dino spanish the currency of reading his text that he provided with this as a sort of guide
01:25:28 so let me read it's a couple of sentences here here we go so i thought about this during the
01:25:32 ratifocus cop kill is getting over it with ben at faady episode uh but i got motivated to make this
01:25:36 after the free speech podcast if for no other reason then it forced me to work and something
01:25:40 aren't related okay blah blah who cares let's get let's get back to us let's let's keep it on focus
01:25:43 here um i feel like giving each member a dual color profile makes it easier to use similar
01:25:48 colors that are shared by pcb members it's magenta ish colors for digi and mage cyan turquoisey
01:25:53 colors for divu and hippo as well as being more visually cohesive for members that have more than
01:25:57 one color typically associated with them like ben's black and white also it makes it easy to come up
01:26:01 with simplified avatars if need be if the bcb wants to streamline the aesthetics of the podcast
01:26:06 screen these are good reasons these are good thoughts i like i like ben's i like digis and
01:26:11 mages tom's is a bit i don't know tom's is interesting it's that blue is exactly the same
01:26:17 as divu's aesthetically tom's is a little true that's true actually i mean i think this mine
01:26:21 mine isn't cool it's not the right type yeah this is the real shit i don't like okay i love how
01:26:26 this is the fan art appreciation and we are shitting well this is like a business decision
01:26:32 egg yeah we're talking about the real shit it's i i when i really i really give this the the the
01:26:39 i think like this dual color system even if we don't like the specific colors offered
01:26:44 is a good idea i do a backup secondary color i like it i i i will die on this hill i will
01:26:50 fucking die okay i absolutely oppose i mean i maybe i'm biased because i as the black and
01:26:57 white guy i am kind of you know i need to you know one one doesn't do it for me um uh sure sure
01:27:05 but i think it's makes sense for everyone else you know i mean we need unity we can't have this
01:27:11 this do you think colors when you do you think that can be magenta or it can be purple willy
01:27:17 nilly no we need the hardbacks we need one well the one is the primary the one is the
01:27:23 should the one should be the primary one even have the secondary if it oh it doesn't matter at all
01:27:27 no just pay just the primary well just just a further differentiate because there's not that
01:27:31 many colors on the wheel we need to have them be separate enough so they don't need a secondary
01:27:36 munchie do you think they can stand alone do you think that this is like a mealy mouth kind of
01:27:41 like limperisted compromise that is like like like like not like like too too much of a compromise
01:27:48 to even be worth doing i think it's too much of a compromise and i think that it we like we're not
01:27:53 paying attention to what really matters and that's what's giving like the reason we're talking about
01:27:58 is because every person needs to be defined by one color that makes them stand out well primary
01:28:04 colors and secondary little baby colors if they just complicate things further oh just for clarity
01:28:11 to help when when necessary you know there can't be no help that's cheating that is fucking cheating
01:28:17 we didn't have one color that's the point is if we have one color that makes it so that you can
01:28:23 easily identify them from a glitch you can't have a fucking magnifying glass finding oh oh the
01:28:28 primary colors in each fucking drawing of nate you can't have that all right here's the thing
01:28:36 there will be like a the most like good-looking collection of all the colors if we if everyone
01:28:45 is together but i think the point of having a secondary color is if like two of them
01:28:52 when they're just alone like two people uh using their primary color the primary and color of
01:28:58 both people is is you know it's too similar so one of them can use their secondary color
01:29:03 and i guess that's the point but i still feel like i feel like i feel like i'm agreeing
01:29:08 more with much this color is so inconsistent say if if you're with fucking i don't know i don't
01:29:14 know like like like davoo and like hippo are there yeah it's it's still gonna and then and then on
01:29:21 the next one on the fucking next one it's davoo and i don't know someone else you're not gonna have
01:29:27 that consistency that you need that the entire point of this is to have consistency and have one
01:29:33 person be represented all the time they need to be consistent okay i we don't need to settle this
01:29:39 right now uh dino spinach great job fantastic let's appreciate that if you see below that that's
01:29:54 the colors that i want did digi is still i'm still unhappy with digi but this is generally i think this
01:30:00 is i think this is the way the wind's blowing i think this is what we need to have uh okay okay uh
01:30:04 so here's here's the next little art that we're going to be appreciating oh let me get that this
01:30:08 is by cappy it's by cappy and uh it's uh it's a little alley with some snakes
