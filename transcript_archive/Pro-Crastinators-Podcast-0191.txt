00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome to Your Nightmare. It's The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm the
00:00:10 best guy ever. And today we're joined by Ben and Tom. Hey. We're just one person. We're
00:00:16 one weird amalgamation of internet hobo. We did the fusion dance before the show. Hey guys.
00:00:23 It's happening. I'm here. Bombsoliver. And I got a lot of personal problems. I got a
00:00:29 lot of emotional weight. I'm going to need you guys to shoulder for me, right? I'm going
00:00:35 to need you guys to do a lot of the emotional lifting for me, if you know what I'm saying.
00:00:39 That emotional lifting can most efficiently be done. I can't really support myself, you
00:00:41 know what I'm saying. I agree. I can't really, kind of a burden on others, you know, is what
00:00:47 I'm going to be. That's what I strive for. You need an emotional spotter, so to speak.
00:00:51 Yeah. Kind of an emotional vampire. Yeah, yeah. If you wear a burden most of your life, you
00:00:56 probably have huge thighs. They're very muscular and able to do so. Or is it like the opposite,
00:01:02 where they're just worn down over time? You start with a certain amount of hit points,
00:01:06 and they just get ground down over time. It's not a load like the load of iron that one
00:01:11 might lift to become strong. It's more of a load of like extra DNA in your bloodstream
00:01:21 that might make your blood cells spherical or some weird shit, right? Do you think that
00:01:29 people with Down syndrome weigh more than people with that, because they have the extra
00:01:32 chromosome in all their DNA? I don't know. You mean the weight of the chromosome itself?
00:01:39 Well, like every cell in their fucking body, he's going to have tons of DNA strands. They
00:01:43 must. Is this the least logical thing ever said? I don't think so. Here's my counter
00:01:48 argument. What do you think is the weight of chromosomal matter as compared to average
00:01:55 material of a human body? Do you think that a chromosome is more or less dense than the
00:01:59 rest of a human body on average? I'm going to bet that it's more. Well, if a chromosome
00:02:02 is like one one hundredth of a cell's weight, and we're all made up of cells, and all our
00:02:08 cells are made up of trillions of cells, we're getting like 1% heavier, right? No, I'm saying
00:02:13 though, it's not about, I don't think the chromosome adds overall weight. I think the
00:02:17 chromosome must add proportional weight, right? I think you're going to, it's like buoyancy
00:02:21 problem. You got to find the chromosome's density, you know, and then find the additional
00:02:28 or subtraction as opposed to a comparable volume of otherwise presumably average human
00:02:37 matter. Well, okay, you're talking about buoyancy and whatnot, and that makes sense. What if
00:02:40 we could do it in a vacuum and just, okay, maybe just mass based on total mass is the
00:02:45 average mass of an individual with Down syndrome more than someone without. I would guess it's
00:02:51 more for all of the things being equal. That's the same question, that's the exact same question.
00:02:55 Maybe I just don't understand. Ben has a physics degree, we can't even argue about this. That's
00:03:00 true. That's too powerful for us. It's not a biology degree though, maybe that's a factor.
00:03:04 I'm trying to be right. He's doing physics calculations right now. I'm trying to be
00:03:09 right about this. The problem though is that I cannot find, I cannot find how dense is a
00:03:14 chromosome. Google's not helping me. Yeah, well, it's like, it's, there's no article on Wikipedia,
00:03:20 so I just, I'll never know the answer, I guess. Well, let's see, a chromosome, massive a chromosome.
00:03:27 Oh, okay, the average human chromosome contains about one times 10, 108, I'm going to assume
00:03:35 that's one times 10 to the eighth BP of DNA. If each base pair has a mass of about 660 Dalton,
00:03:43 Dalton's, and there are about two G of protein plus histones plus non-histones per gram of DNA,
00:03:52 how much is a chromosome way? What's the end, don't ask me the question, I want the answer. Oh my
00:03:57 god, this is like a fucking quiz I have to take. They're still, they're still working on this. We're
00:04:01 still trying to hammer out this answer even now. What the fuck is a Dalton? I've never heard of
00:04:06 a Dalton before, although that is that guy from Chrono Trigger who steals the, the bird, the
00:04:11 Silbird from you? I'm shocked, isn't Dalton like a guy from One Piece, I thought you would say? That's
00:04:17 also a guy in One Piece who turns into an ox, yes. He's the guy from, from Cherry, not Cherry Island.
00:04:22 Chromosomes, Dalton's, all the Dalton's change into things or steal things. It was Drum Island,
00:04:28 now renamed the Sakura Kingdom. Actually, you know what, it probably still is Drum Island that
00:04:32 just houses the Sakura Kingdom that was previously the Waffle Kingdom. So I wasn't completely off base.
00:04:37 Yeah, he's the guy, he's the, the cool guy, he's the, the cool warrior man. Yeah, he's all right.
00:04:43 He became king. Down syndrome is cool, confirmed by fiction. Hey, Monarchy,
00:04:48 yay or nay, as an institution. Dude, the Diviner and the Kings do. I'm leading a hard yay right now.
00:04:52 Like the, the absolute consolidation of power, dude. Yeah, pretty good.
00:04:56 Dab, dab on. Cool, look, I'm the king, not cool if I'm not the king. What if you were the one with
00:05:01 the power though, Ben? What if it was you who was king? Then I would. Yay or nay? Dab on it.
00:05:07 I'm gonna dab on that throne, boys, for all to see. And the sword is just a simulation of the
00:05:11 divine right of kings, for Ben and Munchy. Hey, you know, if you go to patreon.com
00:05:16 slash PCP Minecraft and you join the Minecraft server, you can walk your hot little feet on
00:05:22 south and take a right towards Dabbington. And you can see what I would imagine would be
00:05:26 Ben St. Throne Room, which is those, those dabbing statues leading up to someone's house. I forget
00:05:32 whose house that is, but it is a real place in a fictional world that is the PCP Minecraft server.
00:05:37 More like, more like. The Minecraft server is more real than real life.
00:05:41 I prefer to spend my time in the PCP Minecraft server as opposed to real life.
00:05:47 Oh, that's right. We're not gonna do it again for the holidays.
00:05:50 Like, I don't want to do more. I want to do more Minecraft. Guys, did you know Minecraft is a video
00:05:56 game that's enjoyed by millions? No. That doesn't sound right to me. I can't be true.
00:06:02 How long have, how, people have been being entertained by this software for years and
00:06:06 nobody told me? That's why I wasn't I invited. It just happened that way. Hey,
00:06:14 speaking of, of tedium of life dragging you down bit by bit towards the shallow grave that's
00:06:19 inevitable for us all, I had a tragic experience this week in multiple ways as you will hear now,
00:06:26 which was just so I had purchased. Actually, okay, I won't start the story there. I will
00:06:32 circle back to reveal this information that will now be a secret until we get there in the narrative,
00:06:36 which is, so I'm taking Sessho out for a walk, right? He seemed maybe a little sluggish,
00:06:41 maybe a little sleepy that day. I don't know what was going on, but he seemed fine. So I take him
00:06:45 out all of a sudden. This can't end well. He's projectile shitting, like you wouldn't believe,
00:06:51 like a steady stream of liquid shit out his ass. He's like propelling himself on the ice with
00:06:57 the rocket. Basically, basically, yes. It was with the force of a thousand suns. It was an
00:07:02 incredible sight to behold. And it was something I'm imagining like a I'm just I'm just imagining
00:07:09 that that starts happening. You grab the leash to stop him. But of course, you're on the ice as
00:07:15 well. You're all behind the laws of physics. You end up going like down a hill really fast,
00:07:21 you know, propelled by dog shit. It was a Christmas miracle. So that's happening, whatever. He took a
00:07:33 horrible, nasty liquid shit. I got over that. And then I went inside and I was I was wondering,
00:07:39 I was like, Michelle, Sessho just took like the weirdest shit I've never seen before. What is
00:07:43 happening here? We didn't know he seemed generally fine besides that. Anyway, like the day goes on
00:07:48 and then all of a sudden I realized, guys, I had bought my parents for Christmas, a lovely box of
00:07:54 chocolates, just the nicest little box of chocolates from Godiva. It was wonderful. I just suddenly
00:08:01 noticed under the chair, there is a ripped up piece of this box. And I'm thinking about how did this
00:08:06 get what so up with this? And in case you guys don't know, chocolate is lethal to dogs. This is
00:08:11 when I'm this is what's reported. They're like, I've been in the past, such as like gotten little
00:08:16 bits of chocolate. And I've rushed to like is my dog dead.com for like the chocolate.
00:08:20 The answer is always resounding. Yes. It's always yes. Thank God I didn't buy the dark
00:08:26 chocolates or he'd be dead where he stands today was milk chocolate, I guess, probably.
00:08:30 Anyway, obviously Sessho had he this is insane. We had it in a bag on top of a table there. I
00:08:35 guess there was a chair kind of nearby. He must have done some crazy parkour shit to get up there.
00:08:40 But he pulled out like the box of chocolates he ripped it open. He ate every single chocolate
00:08:45 that were individually wrapped in the box except for one that I guess his fat little body couldn't
00:08:50 reach. And I mean, this this this is the reason why the shit was weird. So we deduced this he was a
00:08:58 terrible person. Hopefully he regrets it. But then he's just shitting in the worst possible ways
00:09:03 all over the place. And there's like a room that he goes to shit in if we don't walk him fast enough.
00:09:08 And you know, sometimes that happens, whatever, we try to walk as best we can. And then I walk in
00:09:13 and there's like half on like the pad, we put down these puppy pads, whatever they'll piss his
00:09:18 shit on so he doesn't do it on the rug. It's like half on half off. There's just a spray of liquid
00:09:23 shit all over the fucking rug and this pad. It's just a true nightmare. The point of the story is
00:09:32 he ate all the chocolate. It was a it was a Christmas gift for my mother. Sessho ate it
00:09:37 callously. He shit everywhere. He almost killed himself. He would have been dead. And now he's
00:09:42 currently in gay baby jail where we have put him, which is to say he's in like the the shelter,
00:09:48 not the fucking shelter. He's in fucking daycare until we come get him after after we get back
00:09:55 from visiting the folks. And I have to go replace the fucking chocolates with something else for my
00:10:00 asshole mother. This is why you don't let your dog you made it clear to him that he is being
00:10:06 punished. His abandonment is a punishment. Yes, I think I think that's very clear. He definitely
00:10:11 knows very clear. Yeah. And one other factor here is just that I so so as everyone knows,
00:10:17 we've been trying to work to lose Sessho. Wait, he he succeeded. He I mean, he weighed like 28
00:10:22 pounds. His goal is like 25. He reached 25. And the last measurement he was like 24 and a half or
00:10:27 something. So like he's doing great. He's at his target weight, whatever. But I think that because
00:10:31 we've been feeding him so little, I think it's actually draw driven him into the kind of a
00:10:35 Garfield-esque diet week madness where he's just been he's been particularly energetic. He's been
00:10:41 freaking out when we give him food. Dude, maybe he's got maybe he's got keto energy. Maybe he's
00:10:46 achieved clarity, mental clarity. That's probably it. That's what he's accessing energy centers that
00:10:52 he didn't know he had, I think. And so he's been like, for example, we had a pumpkin. It was just
00:10:56 a pumpkin that we had on the shelf, you know, since Christmas, it was doing fine. And it was in range
00:11:01 of him for months. And only now, only yesterday, did he decide it was time to rip into that pumpkin
00:11:07 and eat the precious seeds and gunk inside. So I think based on these conclusions, I think that
00:11:13 we are it's time to up his food a little bit. So he'll stop being a monster. But still fuck you,
00:11:20 Sessho, for eating those expensive chocolates, your piece of shit. So there you go. I hate my dog.
00:11:25 I'll end his life. And that's it. This story would be not a problem for me at all. If he just
00:11:35 hadn't shit on the carpet. That's the one thing I can't forgive. Because we yes, we have like this
00:11:42 liquid cleaner thing that you put stuff into to try to clean. I cannot get all the shit out of
00:11:46 that carpet. I just can't do it. It's soaked in there. It'll never be clean again.
00:11:51 Good job, Sessho. You did it. Yeah. Yeah. That's why you don't let your dog play near his edge.
00:11:57 Those are clearly transferable skills. And he got the parkour abilities. And now he's just all over
00:12:02 the place. You gave him energy and you gave him the means. You fool. It was a mistake. It was a
00:12:09 mistake. So there's your Sessho update for the week, everybody. He's the worst. And he's paying
00:12:14 for it. Fascinating. More proof that pets are a mistake. Never get them.
00:12:21 He's a burden. I guess I had a fucking wacky adventure this week. Yeah.
00:12:28 It probably will suck, but whatever. What else are you listeners fucking doing besides listening
00:12:34 to my stupid ass bullshit? I'm already at the bottom of the podcast barrel. I might as well just go full.
00:12:38 So I had a date with a girl. Wow, incredible. It was weird. Unforgivable.
00:12:46 All right. So this is... I'm getting on the bus, right? I'm getting on the bus to go hang out
00:12:52 with Munchy, Kazzy, Kazzy's friend Dusty, and Munchy's friend Leif, who's in town for the week.
00:13:01 Right? This is the setup. And I'm on the bus and it's cold outside, but when it's cold, they fucking
00:13:07 blat... Okay, time for a tangent, guys. I get so fucking mad in the winter because they blast
00:13:14 the heat on public transit. So I will get on the bus and I will immediately start sweating, right?
00:13:20 I will... And like, I'm the only one. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with these other freaks.
00:13:25 Like, I get on the bus. It's like 80 fucking degrees on this bus. I'm sitting here in my full
00:13:29 coat. I have to take all of it off. I have to strip down on my fucking t-shirt and I'm still
00:13:34 too hot and I'm still sweating and everyone else is on the bus and they're fucking, like,
00:13:39 woolen hats and, like, gloves and, like, full-on winter regalia. And I don't understand. I don't
00:13:44 understand what the fuck is wrong with them, okay? It's the uniform of the time. They can't take it
00:13:48 off. It's, well, why aren't they fucking sweating bullets? Like, I am and would definitely be...
00:13:54 They're not. I'm looking at their faces and they're not glistening. I'm glistening. I'm
00:13:58 fucking perspiring. I'm stopping. Anyway... I know what you're talking about, though. It sucks.
00:14:04 Such is my situation today. On that day, rather, I get on the bus, I sit down,
00:14:11 I start sweating and this girl on the bus is like, hey, hold out a fucking napkin at me.
00:14:20 It's like, hey, and I'm like, oh, god, is it that obvious? And she's like, yeah. And I'm like,
00:14:26 all right, cool. So I fucking mop my sweatbrow. And I don't know. At least how you talk about, like,
00:14:31 oh, yeah, where do you live? You live around here? Yeah, cool, cool, cool. And so I get off at Harvard
00:14:37 Square and she's like, the bus takes us a little too far. We both kind of miss where we're going.
00:14:44 We're like, okay, let's walk back to the station. So we walk back to the station, talk about shit.
00:14:48 She's like, okay, hey, what's your number? And I'm like, nice, epic, dab. So we exchange numbers,
00:14:55 right? So I go and I meet up with the guy. I meet up with the boys, right? We go, we're walking
00:15:00 around Boston, we're having a great time. I forget what we did. Oh, yeah, we got Chinese food.
00:15:04 Doesn't matter. Dumplings. So I like, I checked my phone, and this girl called me,
00:15:11 and she left me a message, and she's like, hey, do you want to hang out right now? And I'm like,
00:15:16 we had concluded our business. We were just kind of fucking around. I think we were going to go
00:15:20 back to Kaz's apartment and just fuck around some more. But I get this call and I'm like,
00:15:24 uh, should I go? And everyone's like, oh, Ben, you should go. Oh, you should.
00:15:30 True love only happens once in a lifetime, Ben. Yes, it's a once in a lifetime chance.
00:15:34 Like, oh, if you miss this, you'll always wonder, you'll always wonder what could have been. And
00:15:38 I'm like, oh, God, whatever. All right, fuck, fucking fine. Goodbye. So I leave. And I go,
00:15:46 and she's little did Ben know they just wanted him to leave. I think so. I always suspected.
00:15:53 But now it's confirmed. And she's saying she's at the Starbucks. It takes me forever. I'm on the
00:15:59 train and they tell and we get an announcement of the train. It's like, um, sorry, everyone,
00:16:04 some lovely customer decided to run onto the tracks. So we're going to have to resolve that
00:16:09 situation before we move the train again. So I'm like, I'm like half an hour late. And I'm like, well,
00:16:16 oh, well, but she's still there. She moved next door. Anyway, so anyway, she's a fucking,
00:16:22 she's a fucking crazy person, right? Because the moral of the story is she's fucking
00:16:27 crazy person, probably some straight and this is not an insult, probably some strain of autism,
00:16:33 like a certain, a certain, a certain disregard and an unawareness of like human social convention
00:16:40 definitely shown through. Surely that was what attracted her to you. All of her words and deeds.
00:16:47 We need examples. We need concrete examples.
00:16:51 We need social security numbers, Ben. We need, you know, what was the one thing that like broke
00:16:55 the camel's back and you're like, Oh, no, this, this is clearly a deadly situation.
00:17:02 I mean, it wasn't that bad. I was mostly just kind of amused. But she, well, okay. She, she was like,
00:17:10 she was like super forward about like sex questions. Like, she was really just like,
00:17:17 okay, we're sitting, we're sitting at the bar. Like, we, like we go to, we go to a bar in Harvard
00:17:22 and she's just, we sit down and she's basically just like, hmm, so what are you into? And I'm like,
00:17:28 what do you, and she's like, interpret that however you want. Like Minecraft? And I'm like,
00:17:32 yeah, I don't, I was like, you know, I declined it. I declined to answer. It's too early for that.
00:17:38 Yeah. And she, but she's like, and she just like, like the bartender that, and she's just like,
00:17:44 oh, hey, are you, are you straight? And I'm like, yeah. And she's like, ah, dang, darn, I hate fucking
00:17:50 straight guys or whatever. Like what, like, like what a disaster. You know, I'm looking for,
00:17:55 I'm looking for a quad and I'm like, I'm looking for, for people to fill out my quad. It's got to
00:17:59 be two guys and two girls. And I'm like, dude, she's a fucking troll. She's trying to fill out her
00:18:02 quadrants over here. And I'm like, impressive. And I'm like, what are you, I don't know what a
00:18:07 quad is. Can you, can you back away the fuck up and explain to me what a quad is? Turns out it's
00:18:12 really simple. It's a four way polyamory thing. And it's got to be, and it's got to have, you got
00:18:18 to have the X in the middle. You know what I'm saying? I don't. Is this four or five people?
00:18:27 I'm lost now with this X fact. Four people, but you can't just, it's not like it's everyone,
00:18:33 everyone's dating everyone. Right? Okay. Yeah. It's not like, you know, one person's dating two,
00:18:39 and one person's just dating one, and one's dating the other three. No. It's a mutual,
00:18:42 mutually shared pool. Yes. Each of the four is dating all the other three. This is a fully
00:18:49 realized quad. So while she may perhaps have been attracted to all of them individually,
00:18:53 this would be a no go over relationship if in fact those others were not attracted
00:18:57 to each other. That would just kill it for her. Okay. All right. Sure. Sure. And her,
00:19:01 and it's not necessary for a quad, but her quad that she desires is two guys, two girls.
00:19:08 So, so she's just like, she just says this in like a totally like normal tone of voice,
00:19:13 as though she were describing the weather. Like she, the way you said it before, it sounds like,
00:19:18 like with the barkeep or whatever, just as like also there probably. She's like,
00:19:21 she's talking to the bartender. Okay. We're there. We're on a date. She like, she asks
00:19:26 the bartender for his number, like later, like a couple hours, like before, like before we leave.
00:19:33 She says like she's never, at some point, she has maybe like three drinks. At some point,
00:19:38 she's like, yeah, I've never been drunk. Yeah. One time I drank like 18 drinks. I've never,
00:19:43 I'd never got drunk. Nope. Never. Like, you know, total, probably biologically impossible.
00:19:48 This person is starting to sound a little delusional. She says she's never been drunk.
00:19:51 She drinks like three, then like we get out, we start waiting. I'm kind of tipsy, right?
00:19:57 We leave the place, I've had like five or six, we leave, we're calling an Uber,
00:20:02 she fails to call an Uber three times, maybe it's not her fault, whatever. I finally managed to get
00:20:08 one, like after like an hour of waiting, we get in the, in the car, she starts talking about how
00:20:12 she's got like low blood sugar or whatever, and like she needs a, she needs her medication. She
00:20:17 like she pukes out the fucking passenger side. She pukes, she does. She does, she does. Not drunk,
00:20:23 never been drunk. This is a blood sugar thing. Always needs blood sugar. So, and then, and then
00:20:31 I don't, I don't think I lost her phone. I don't think it was me. I think I gave her phone back
00:20:37 to, I, I hailed the Uber with her phone because mine was dead. I'm like very sure I gave it back
00:20:42 to her, but one way or another, we go back to her house and her phone is gone and she's like,
00:20:48 but you know what? Honestly, she was a good sport about that. I felt bad about it, whatever.
00:20:53 She lives at her parents house. We go into her fucking parents fucking like boomerass house.
00:20:59 I just, I have to use the bathroom. It's not that far from where I live. So I'm like,
00:21:03 I'm like tiptoeing around, you know, she's got a nice cat. I pet the cat and I'm like,
00:21:08 hey, okay, I'm going to, you know, I walk home from here all the time. So I'm going to go and
00:21:12 she's like, okay, yeah, okay. So anyway, it was very weird, very strange. Yeah, that's it. That's
00:21:21 the, there's no moral to the story. That's what happened. And this was on, and this was on like
00:21:25 a Tuesday. Imagine, imagine all that happening on a fucking Tuesday. Yeah, you know, I think our
00:21:32 listeners would perhaps appreciate that when you just kind of go out in the world and do not in
00:21:37 fact spend all day just playing Minecraft, but just like occasionally talk to people. You can
00:21:42 have kind of mini adventures. We want our audience to play Minecraft. It's always a mistake. You
00:21:46 should subscribe to the PCP Minecraft Patreon server so you can avoid this sort of bullshit.
00:21:52 Keep your autism contained. Don't go out into the world. Keep it on Minecraft where it belongs
00:21:57 for a nominal fee. Anyway, I haven't told this to anyone. Like, Kazy messaged me earlier in the
00:22:06 week and was like, how to go with that girl? And I didn't respond because I'm like...
00:22:12 Did true love win, Ben? The truth is boring. The truth is like lame. I don't know. I don't want to say it.
00:22:18 People want a salacious story or something. So obviously it's an amusing anecdote, which I was
00:22:23 happy to hear, but... That's why you just have to respond bad. And that's it. Just let their
00:22:28 imagination fill in the rest. Then they want to know the fucking details. It wasn't even like a
00:22:33 terrible time or anything. Just kind of like... That's weird. The ambiguity of the statement,
00:22:39 though, it creates a bit of intrigue that you can't do by yourself. Of course. That's the
00:22:43 point. The goal is to create... Well, you know, I watched a favorite movie of mine. Keep them
00:22:50 guessing. Make them think they're the crazy one. Gas clay. That's the way. That's the way.
00:22:55 And the movie, The Prestige, is a very valuable lesson in it. It's a good movie, whatever. It's
00:23:00 not Christopher Nolan. It's... No, it is. The guy who made The Dark Knight, whatever. It's
00:23:04 obviously really edgy and cool. But the main thing I get away from it is that there's this
00:23:10 moral that if you're a magician, people will hound you for your secrets, but the second they give
00:23:15 it to you, you are worthless. You're not cool anymore, and you can fucking die. So always hold
00:23:20 on to your secrets, guys. It keeps you interesting. Don't be overly forward and honest like I can be,
00:23:25 and it makes you boring. It's important. I don't have any secrets.
00:23:29 That's your secret. You need to keep secret. You have to keep it a secret that you have no secrets.
00:23:35 That too. Literally true. Literally true. It's helpful in making you seem like a cool guy.
00:23:41 People always like to think. I mean, Ben lives a mysterious, degenerate life. That could mean
00:23:46 anything on any given day. Oh, the mystery, the intrigue. What are the details?
00:23:51 You just got to keep your statements vague. Let people's imagination fill in the gaps
00:23:55 with the best possible interpretation of what you say, so you become cooler to them just by
00:24:00 their own projection. I've been thinking about reading Sam Harris's book, Lying, specifically,
00:24:07 because I've long been a believer that lying is a very immoral thing to do, and I want to do as
00:24:15 little of it as possible for a number of reasons. But with subjects like that, that's not a lie.
00:24:22 You're not doing anything that's a lie, but I wonder about the world.
00:24:24 Some would consider that a lie by omission. Well, a lie by omission, or even
00:24:29 is it immoral to create an air of mystique around yourself to make you seem cooler than you actually
00:24:34 are? I would suppose it depends on the purpose of the mystique. Well, it serves you like a practical
00:24:38 purpose of like making, like upping your like, I don't know, social capital. But like, if that's a
00:24:44 lie, then you're kind of misleading people sort of into being more interested in you than you deserve
00:24:50 I don't know. I suppose you could play it off that you just want to keep your personal information
00:24:54 to yourself, and whatever conjectures people come to based on your vague statements is their
00:24:58 own issue and not yours? I mean, that's true. And I mean, there's another factor here that's like,
00:25:03 like, let's just say that you decide it's immoral to like, pretend to be cooler than you are,
00:25:07 like in any small way, that you insist on being an open book, like overly so. The thing is, that
00:25:11 makes you stand out in a weird way compared to every other person on the planet. And now,
00:25:16 so you just like totally sunk your social capital in a way that like no one else does.
00:25:20 You become the girl we just talked about. Yeah, sort of, sort of, which is
00:25:25 you become the autism arbiter, and we just don't want that. Nobody wants that.
00:25:29 It was a tough game. It's a tough game to play. It's to be
00:25:31 Socrates had it down. Golden mean, my dudes, don't be too autistic, but be a little autistic.
00:25:37 Keep them on the edge of their seat. Mm hmm. Agreed. That's what we've learned today.
00:25:41 Life lessons going into the next decade audience. Remember these words.
00:25:45 Oh, hey, speaking of decades, I just I noticed a random factoid is I was scrolling back.
00:25:49 I was just thinking today at the end of this decade and year and whatnot about how old the
00:25:53 PCP was the first episode of the PCP was released. Today's the December 22nd was released December
00:26:00 23rd, 2015. So tomorrow is the PCP's fourth birthday since the first episode was posted.
00:26:09 Isn't that interesting? Oh, no. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, boy. This is all we have to show for four
00:26:15 years of labor. Indeed. God damn it. I was just tweeting about how I miss the old days. Now
00:26:22 everything sucks now. Oh, yeah. I guess you've got to revive horse cast is what you're saying.
00:26:27 Yeah, just how back in the pony days, it felt like we were all going somewhere.
00:26:31 Look, we all got to hit it hard. When pony life drops, we all have to pick up, you know,
00:26:36 back in the saddle quite literally. Back in the saddle. We'll call it that. That'll be the new
00:26:40 podcast. Exactly. I mean, maybe we should do it. I mean, we did it for the movie, right? Didn't we?
00:26:44 I have no problem with like a one, I mean, just for example, like a one time episode of us watching
00:26:49 like season, would it be gen five, gen six? I do it. Oh, I agree. Get Dr. Wolf on for the
00:26:55 guests for that episode. It'll be a good time. Let's get, I love Kim Possible a lot for the
00:26:59 guests. Dude, yes. Dude, we, okay, we should, we need to have more guests. It's fine. I agree.
00:27:04 It's fucked up. It's fucked up. I mean, look at the people who showed up for today's episode.
00:27:08 It's clear we need guests. It's clear we need, yeah. There's three degenerates. This is just
00:27:13 not going to cut it last. You know what? On the guest thing, I think that the guest format is just,
00:27:18 is a little easier for me to think about if we have like some kind of like thing that we're going
00:27:23 to discuss with them, even if it's just like their project or something. We should have a prepared
00:27:27 topic if we're bringing a guest in. I think that maybe for those, it makes sense, even if it's
00:27:31 something soft. Absolutely. But yeah. Well, I mean, it should be something relevant to the
00:27:35 guest, right? I agree. We should, we should give them a bit of an advantage. We should, we should
00:27:39 just ask them to suggest something, yeah? Or, or maybe there's just something like we could just
00:27:44 suggest like, hey, you know, fucking, you made a new game, sir, or you are a really cool guy. Let's
00:27:49 discuss your work. No, no, no. No one who actually has accomplished anything would ever want to be
00:27:54 on our podcast. We're going to have to, we're going to have to softball him. Okay. We're going to,
00:27:58 we're going to have to make suggestions like, hey, what do you think about climate change?
00:28:05 What should we tell us? Sure. Sure. What a riveting topic.
00:28:09 This, this, this I think is the strategy. I think we can all agree that having like more diverse
00:28:15 different voices on the episode is always good. They're sick of our shit. And I don't know. And
00:28:20 also I think that having topics of some kind is generally a good focusing point for us to just
00:28:25 have something to bounce off of. So yeah, we're just going to like lean into the meme and just
00:28:29 become Digi's anime podcast that everyone thinks this actually is. We should embrace the meme.
00:28:35 Okay, wait, don't tell anyone, don't tell anyone this, maybe future bonus episode,
00:28:39 maybe just an episode. We just call it Digi's anime podcast as the name of that episode.
00:28:44 I feel like the only people that think that are the people who have never actually listened to
00:28:48 it, right? Agreed. I mean, I agree. I agree. And that's, and that's why it's funny. You can just
00:28:53 tell immediately who has never listened to the show. They know it's much worse than that if they
00:28:57 wouldn't. In the process of like capturing new viewers in any mechanism, in any way, like that
00:29:03 would not be by like, oh, I'm now suddenly interested in this podcast or these, it'll be like, oh,
00:29:07 there's something cool about this show that's presumably not anime or Digi podcast related
00:29:14 specifically, probably, you know, as part of it perhaps, but we have something else to bring.
00:29:18 If this is Digi's anime podcast, he's like the CEO just stays in his office and does nothing
00:29:23 while all of us, the workers, toil away. Absorbing our surplus labor value, god damn it. Oh,
00:29:28 it's infuriating. That's not really the case, though. Nate's the only one, Nate's the only one
00:29:34 who skims anything off the top. And I mean, Nate actually does like actual work. But he does earn
00:29:40 his keep. I would argue that I am underpaid for the amount of time I put in, but hey, that's,
00:29:44 that's life, baby. You actually do like sort of make it all run.
00:29:50 Yeah. I pull the gears and levers. I turn the wheels of the world as it is. I am a god.
00:29:57 I'm about to shrug, motherfucker. I know big way. Do we have a potential guest list?
00:30:03 You know, I think we had some list of like a couple of people who we were thinking of inviting.
00:30:08 That should be our resolution for the new year is more guests on the PCP.
00:30:11 Make the podcast not shit. What? Yes. Let's not go crazy.
00:30:17 Yeah, that's true. That's asking a lot. I'm sure we could think of some people who we'd want to
00:30:21 have on the show. I mean, and I frankly, I know quite a few people. Look, even if these people
00:30:27 aren't like, I don't know, super famous wouldn't give us like tons of new viewership, just having
00:30:31 a new voice. I know people who would be interested. We should get Vivzi on. We should get Vivzi Pop on
00:30:35 to ask what she thinks about the knot. We should get Vivzi's dog on to hear, you know,
00:30:40 he's kind of sorry about it. Get old Fido on the show. You can just see it in her eyes that
00:30:45 she's thinking about the knot. I'm sorry. She's thinking about it. We can call the episode the
00:30:51 knot or tying the knot, perhaps. Can you, can you not? Can you not?
00:31:02 Holy shit, that's a great name for a show. Oh, like a furry podcast? Can you not? That would be
00:31:07 incredible. Damn. Did you just discover our new revenue stream? Copyright Tom, you can't have that.
00:31:15 New side stream. That's another great bonus episode idea. New side stream. It's all just
00:31:20 punching down at furries and other furries. Well, they've thoroughly earned it, I would say. Can you
00:31:25 not? I'm also writing Digi's anime podcast. It's called Can You Not? Digi's anime podcast.
00:31:38 Endorsed by Digibro. Send all complaints to Twitter at Digibro.
00:31:50 I'm sure he would enjoy that. Let me say, let me say, what else am I going to bring up? I think
00:31:55 there was one or two other things. Oh, hey, hey, I was curious. Oh, I made another big batch of
00:32:00 curry yesterday, guys. It's large. It looks beautiful. Oh, it is. It is so good. And you know,
00:32:08 I think you guys would be proud. Maybe I'll get a picture of this later. But there's a, when I went
00:32:12 to the store this time, I was bereft of curry for a full, I don't know, like month, and it made me
00:32:17 want to kill myself. So this time I bought, you know how they have those like wooden, or sorry,
00:32:22 not wooden, like the cardboard, like things that like the product sit in on the shelves of any
00:32:28 individual product? Yes. I just bought the whole thing. An entire one of those. Damn.
00:32:32 It had a full like 12 boxes of curry. And it was the best purchase. So curry comes in like a box,
00:32:39 right? And it comes in a box of like cubes that you that you break up and put in the stew.
00:32:45 That's right. That's right. So how many boxes did you get? I bought 12 individual boxes and each
00:32:50 box is like one. I mean, I use two for my things, but like I use a big pot and make like a lot of
00:32:57 it at a time. So it's probably like double the normal amount or whatever. So like 12, you know,
00:33:01 12 boxes. And I'll buy more. Oh, it's so good. It's my favorite food, probably right now. I make
00:33:07 it myself. It's delicious. It's pork, carrots. And I got to tell you, you know, yesterday, when I was
00:33:13 making it, Michelle was like, Nate, you those sweet potatoes look so gross, because I was chopping
00:33:17 up these incredibly old sweet potatoes. Oh, they were, well, I'll tell you why it's the fact,
00:33:22 it's the fact they were old and moldy and oozing liquid. And I was like, no, no, no, Michelle,
00:33:26 these are the best part. We can cut around. Okay, okay. We can cut around the mold. Oosing
00:33:31 liquid is a little far. It's a little too far. I was so willing to put those in because they're
00:33:35 so good. They're the best thing in the curry, the sweet potatoes, the yams. Oh my God, I love them
00:33:41 so much. And that bitch, Michelle, she robbed me. She was like, I will not eat that. And I was like,
00:33:47 well, this is why God invented divorce, I guess, for this very purpose. You should have just been
00:33:52 like, you're lost, bitch, and just made them anyways. What were you thinking? I mean, I'm with
00:33:56 you. I don't know. Like, for instance, downstairs in my fruit bowl, there is an overripe avocado.
00:34:03 And I am angry at whoever left it there, whoever purchased that avocado and didn't eat it, right?
00:34:09 Sure, I understand. I consider it a crime that has been dealt to me personally.
00:34:14 I do hate, now that I buy all my own food and shit, I do hate wasting it. It is very
00:34:19 annoying to see any food go to waste. I have one of my roommates works at a deli, basically. And so
00:34:26 I think that food does not carry quite the same intrinsic moral weight to him because he just
00:34:33 got it all the time and probably has to throw tons of it out in the course of his job.
00:34:36 It's become a crime.
00:34:37 So he's just got all this, he'll cook food and leave half of it in the fridge and just let it
00:34:42 go bad. And I'm over here like, just let me eat it. Just let me eat it all. God damn it.
00:34:49 We have to find an answer to the food question sometime because I hate this fucking, we throw
00:34:55 out so much food and it annoys me to no end. I never throw out food unless absolutely necessary.
00:35:03 I'll eat it, whatever the fuck it is. I don't know. Sometimes things are in the fridge too long
00:35:06 and they get gross. And I guess the worst thing I do is I'll buy a bunch of vegetables and then I
00:35:11 just won't cook with it. And then it's too old to cook with and then I throw it away.
00:35:16 That's the only thing I do.
00:35:17 Somebody got heavy cream, like two very small, very small containers of heavy,
00:35:22 heavy cream, like one cup containers, like really little. And they were in the fridge
00:35:28 because we had other heavy creams, so nobody opened them. And like it finally comes down
00:35:31 to, oh, we're done with that, that carton time to open up the new one. Oh, we got these two
00:35:35 little ones. And they were like a month overdue or over ex expiration. And like their contents
00:35:41 was just like solid, like a paste. Yeah, like it didn't even didn't smell or anything. It just
00:35:46 had sort of turned into sort of a-
00:35:48 You just got to stir it around. That's still good. That's still good.
00:35:50 Honestly, honestly, it seemed like maybe if I had like sweetened it or something,
00:35:54 I could have eaten it as like a custard. Like it didn't seem-
00:35:57 Oh, dear.
00:35:58 It didn't seem that nasty. That's how they make yogurt, right?
00:36:00 To be perfectly honest.
00:36:01 But I mean, if you want to have the authentic Sessho experience, and yeah, you would just
00:36:06 eat that in a custard, I guess.
00:36:09 I mean, okay, what is cheese? Like what is yogurt, right?
00:36:12 Exactly. It had become some kind of cheese.
00:36:15 I feel like there's more artistry to cheese than that.
00:36:19 No, there's fucking none. I don't know.
00:36:21 It's just a sun net. It's just nature taking its course.
00:36:25 It's just a complete accident that happens every single time.
00:36:28 Oh. I mean, you could argue that like the yogurt industry was like originally made,
00:36:34 like on the back of like spoiled food that they found a way to market, which I think is true.
00:36:38 But now I'm pretty into it. It's pretty good. It's pretty good stuff.
00:36:43 I like a gogurt on occasion.
00:36:45 I'm a pretty energetic guy. I'm a kid on the go.
00:36:52 I don't have time to fuck with a spoon.
00:36:57 I hope we get to that point.
00:36:58 I need something to keep my lunch cold. I gotta freeze my fucking yogurt.
00:37:02 Freeze my yogurt. Yeah, it's good cold or room temperature.
00:37:07 Hot or cold, you know?
00:37:10 I mean, I was going to say that I can't wait for like businessmen to be eating yogurt.
00:37:12 Sweet or savory.
00:37:14 It's the optimal food. But then I think about, I actually,
00:37:17 I don't know, in animes, but occasionally in like Japanese stuff,
00:37:20 you'll see like businessmen eating those like, like,
00:37:23 they're kind of like baby food pouches that you can get at convenience stores in Japan and stuff.
00:37:26 Oh, yeah, yeah. Fruit mash or whatever.
00:37:30 Yeah, yeah. Which is, it's good. It's good. I've had a couple of them.
00:37:32 I had one. I liked it.
00:37:34 For men on a mission, you just don't have time to consume.
00:37:37 But just like all individually packaged foods, it's too expensive. It's horseshit.
00:37:42 Well, that's true. I would never purchase it at my own volition.
00:37:45 The struggle.
00:37:47 I just want, I just want the world to adopt, like,
00:37:51 forget like a universal currency. I just want a universal food.
00:37:54 We all just agree. We give up food and we just eat,
00:37:58 slop, optimally, like, nutrition, slop.
00:38:01 I know it's going to be a little different for everybody.
00:38:02 Wait, did you get the email? Did you get the email?
00:38:04 Are you on the Hewlett mailing list?
00:38:06 Yes, I am. Hewlett 3.0.
00:38:08 Did you see Hewlett 3.0?
00:38:10 New Hewlett bars, that's right.
00:38:12 But they also said that powders, they've revised the formula.
00:38:15 They now have Hewlett version 3. Oh.
00:38:17 And I'm curious to try it.
00:38:18 What a fucking minute.
00:38:19 I just bought a bunch more version 2, goddammit.
00:38:21 So Hewlett has moved into the solid food market?
00:38:24 Ah, yes, they have.
00:38:25 What a bunch of bullshit.
00:38:27 What a betrayal of all its principles.
00:38:29 No, it's not.
00:38:29 We know that Hewlett, Hewlett's like single serving, like,
00:38:32 drinks and the single, and like, these bars,
00:38:35 they're obviously just a cater to the norm modes, right?
00:38:37 You're like, optimally efficient.
00:38:39 I have to wonder why they even bothered with the liquid in the first place.
00:38:41 If you're as real hooligan as they call you in the email,
00:38:46 you only buy the powder because it's the best price to performance ratio.
00:38:52 You get it, it lasts forever.
00:38:53 For us, the consumer, absolutely.
00:38:55 But like with those products, they're clearly trying
00:38:58 to just get like normal people to consume you.
00:39:00 I bought the bottles and I felt like I betrayed my own values.
00:39:03 So I'm like, this is too convenient and too expensive.
00:39:06 They're so convenient and they're so delicious.
00:39:08 I mean, I love the chocolate ones.
00:39:09 I think they're absolutely fantastic.
00:39:10 It's just, but it's just a mistake.
00:39:13 Guys, no, it's about Questbars.
00:39:14 It's all about Questbars.
00:39:15 Questbars are fantastic.
00:39:17 The problem is I lived off Questbars for like three weeks once
00:39:20 and I couldn't shit for the rest of my life to this day.
00:39:22 I just can't.
00:39:23 They've got low net carbs.
00:39:24 They do.
00:39:25 They're fantastic.
00:39:26 They taste great.
00:39:28 They do.
00:39:28 They're like candy.
00:39:29 They're like my candy.
00:39:30 The texture is actually pretty pleasant.
00:39:34 I have tried like, there's okay, there's only like two flavors.
00:39:38 I looked up online to see if I've missed any.
00:39:40 And there's only like two flavors of Questbar that I've never tried.
00:39:44 And I, if I ever see them in a store, oh my God.
00:39:47 Ben, what you need to do.
00:39:48 I mean, try the donut sprinkle.
00:39:49 The donut sprinkle is very...
00:39:51 Ben, what you need to do is you need to go on eBay
00:39:53 and you have to buy a lot of Questbars.
00:39:55 They'll sell them like a box of 50 for cheap prices,
00:39:59 like half the price of what they are in the store.
00:40:02 So like $3 a bar, which is bullshit, too expensive.
00:40:05 I told my parents.
00:40:07 I told my parents, instead of candy in my stocking,
00:40:10 please just fill it with Questbar.
00:40:11 I passed that along.
00:40:13 I passed that along.
00:40:13 I told mom.
00:40:14 So she shouldn't have...
00:40:15 What is it?
00:40:16 What is it?
00:40:16 Hold on, hold on.
00:40:16 The one that I haven't tried.
00:40:18 Okay.
00:40:19 Fucking mint chocolate chip.
00:40:21 I have never seen mint chocolate chip,
00:40:22 but that, it sounds incredible.
00:40:27 There's like one other, whatever.
00:40:28 It doesn't fucking matter.
00:40:29 Unironically, last year for a while,
00:40:32 like when I was living in the car
00:40:34 and when I was first moving with Digi for a little while,
00:40:37 I had nothing but Questbars and Hewlett
00:40:39 was all I was eating because I had...
00:40:41 Weird, because I've never seen them.
00:40:42 I only started seeing them around like a month or two ago.
00:40:46 Really?
00:40:47 And now suddenly I see them everywhere.
00:40:48 Yeah.
00:40:48 I saw them in a Target.
00:40:50 I've had them for at least two years,
00:40:51 or been aware of them for at least two years.
00:40:53 They're around.
00:40:54 They've just been on the down low, I guess.
00:40:56 But I'm assuming it's because Keto's gotten bigger,
00:40:59 that they have expanded their business for obvious reasons.
00:41:02 They are very Keto friendly.
00:41:05 Maybe, yeah.
00:41:06 I mean, that's why I like...
00:41:07 Two years ago, Keto was not nearly as big of a deal.
00:41:10 It's like Ben found out about it
00:41:11 and then the whole world was like listening to the PCP.
00:41:13 Yeah, I spread the word.
00:41:15 Of course, yeah.
00:41:16 I, you know, the two Keto dudes podcast
00:41:19 spread the word to me
00:41:20 and then I spread the word to everyone else.
00:41:22 The reason...
00:41:23 It's the circle of life.
00:41:24 I found out them not because they were Keto,
00:41:26 but my sister told me she can't have gluten
00:41:29 and they are gluten-free.
00:41:30 And so she's like, these are great bars to have
00:41:32 if you have a gluten allergy like I do.
00:41:35 And they just happened to be Keto on top of it,
00:41:37 which was a good bonus.
00:41:39 Although, I mean, they're Keto,
00:41:41 but not if you eat like 12 of them, which is what I do.
00:41:43 No, that's a bad call.
00:41:45 They're so fucking good.
00:41:46 How do you shit?
00:41:47 Like, they literally just destroy you.
00:41:50 Um, I don't know.
00:41:52 No.
00:41:52 Fuck it.
00:41:53 I guess you're just so Keto-powered now.
00:41:55 Your body's adapted.
00:41:57 Yeah, although I'm off Keto for the holidays
00:41:59 because like, fuck it.
00:42:00 Yeah, it's...
00:42:00 What am I not gonna eat?
00:42:03 Mashed potatoes?
00:42:05 Hey, Ben, I've heard in the grapevine
00:42:06 that your weight loss may have hit its goal
00:42:10 and that it's time to perhaps relax and stop losing weight.
00:42:12 Who the fuck told you that?
00:42:13 Any feedback?
00:42:14 Oh, I'll never tell.
00:42:15 I'll never tell.
00:42:17 It never quite hit the goal I was looking for.
00:42:19 I wanted to get down to like one...
00:42:21 I wanted to get down to 150,
00:42:23 and I never got below like 154.
00:42:25 Damn.
00:42:26 Okay, that's pretty impressive.
00:42:27 It like got close and then kind of stalled out.
00:42:30 Well, that's not bad.
00:42:31 I mean, within four pounds after all that,
00:42:32 I mean, that's what I got to was 173, I think,
00:42:35 which was pretty good.
00:42:37 Hey, that's pretty...
00:42:38 Yeah, that's all gone now though, unfortunately.
00:42:40 I'm gonna have to start again after the holidays.
00:42:43 I've probably gained a few pounds.
00:42:44 I'm probably up in like the low 160s right now.
00:42:46 I had like two slices of pizza and sugar cookies yesterday
00:42:49 while I was holiday shopping.
00:42:50 I felt like a monster.
00:42:51 I also ate pizza yesterday.
00:42:53 I was like, it's that time of year.
00:42:54 Yeah, I suppose it is.
00:42:55 You know what?
00:42:56 I eat pizza and I feel sick immediately afterwards.
00:42:58 I don't know why I do it.
00:42:59 But I always forget.
00:43:00 I always forget.
00:43:01 Like every time I have pizza and an hour later,
00:43:03 I feel like garbage.
00:43:04 I'm like, why don't we go like shit?
00:43:05 I'm like, me and Michelle, me and Michelle were out.
00:43:07 And I just saw like, Michelle, I haven't had pizza in so long.
00:43:09 Like I want a piece of pizza.
00:43:10 Michelle's like, no, Nate, you don't want to eat that.
00:43:12 I'm like, I want a piece of pizza.
00:43:14 So I got a piece from Whole Foods
00:43:17 from their like delicious looking pizza.
00:43:18 That's where I got yesterday too.
00:43:20 I felt so horrible.
00:43:22 Why would you get pizza from Whole Foods?
00:43:23 I mean, it's...
00:43:24 Oh, because I was...
00:43:24 I went to see a movie and it was right next door.
00:43:26 And I was hungry.
00:43:26 I mean, we go to Whole Foods.
00:43:27 It's okay, I was right there.
00:43:28 I ordered, I ordered from fucking Domino's.
00:43:32 I got a $5.99 chicken bacon ranch sauce for dipping.
00:43:38 Classic American.
00:43:39 But I mean, I ate it and I just felt horrible.
00:43:42 It feels good while you're eating.
00:43:43 I mean, this is why we do it, obviously.
00:43:45 The salt and the grease and blah, blah, blah.
00:43:46 But I...
00:43:47 I thought I would feel that way, but I didn't.
00:43:50 I felt fine and I'm actually kind of in a pleasant way,
00:43:53 sort of looking forward to when I go back on keto.
00:43:56 Like when I start dieting again.
00:43:57 I'm looking forward to the sensation of like,
00:44:00 I can feel that I'm losing weight
00:44:02 and I can feel that I'm like, I'm not as heavy as I was.
00:44:06 Yeah, that initial like,
00:44:07 that initial couple pounds of weight loss...
00:44:09 I need to buy a scale because the scale is what keeps me going.
00:44:12 It's so important, Tom.
00:44:13 It's gonna feel good.
00:44:13 It's gonna feel good.
00:44:13 So important to have a scale.
00:44:14 You gotta get that.
00:44:15 That's a priority for weight loss.
00:44:16 Yeah, because like that's when you...
00:44:17 You're just afraid because I know I'm gonna step on it.
00:44:19 I'm gonna be like 25 pounds heavier than it was like last year.
00:44:22 And I'm like, well...
00:44:23 Wait, say it to Tom.
00:44:24 You're gonna get a scale.
00:44:25 You'll do it, right?
00:44:26 I will do it.
00:44:27 I will go get it before the end of the year resolution.
00:44:30 Did I mention that my roommate, same one that works at the deli,
00:44:35 he got a new scale because we had kind of an old craft.
00:44:38 When he got a new one, that was like, it had like,
00:44:42 it had a computer inside.
00:44:43 Oh, I think you told the story when like,
00:44:45 you used it without permission and like,
00:44:47 he got a notification on his phone or something.
00:44:49 I mean, that's not...
00:44:50 Yeah, yeah.
00:44:51 Well, I mean, it's not like he was like,
00:44:53 I mean, how much do you don't need permission
00:44:54 to fucking step on a scale?
00:44:55 But yeah, he would get like, he would get alerts on his phone
00:44:58 telling him how much I weighed because I looked like you used your scale.
00:45:03 It was like hooked to an app on his phone.
00:45:05 Dude, technology is too powerful now.
00:45:08 This is just, you don't...
00:45:09 There's some boundaries you just can't cross.
00:45:11 And like, the relationship between a man and his scale is just sacrosanct.
00:45:15 You can't do this.
00:45:18 Or can you?
00:45:19 I guess you can now.
00:45:21 But like, that's the whole point.
00:45:22 We've gone too far.
00:45:24 Yeah, well, we're making everything like, it's like in the,
00:45:27 like in Metal Gear Solid 4,
00:45:29 all weapons are like, like individually DNA tagged.
00:45:32 So like, every machine is like,
00:45:34 for use by a specific human ID and no one else.
00:45:37 Our scales, this is kind of similar to what's going on with the scale sort of.
00:45:41 I mean, it's plugged into like a system here
00:45:43 that's like expecting it to only be used by him.
00:45:46 Then we'll find a way to spoof DNA,
00:45:48 and then people get framed for crimes all the time.
00:45:51 And there'll be a whole other industry.
00:45:52 We're going to have to unravel.
00:45:54 Everything is shit.
00:45:55 And we do need to return to a mythologized past
00:45:59 wherein our people was, were great.
00:46:01 Do you have any,
00:46:02 do you have any sympathies for the anarcho-primitivist movement, Ben?
00:46:05 Absolutely disgusting.
00:46:07 Oh, really?
00:46:08 Absolutely vile and pitiful.
00:46:11 I couldn't agree more.
00:46:12 Pitiful weak cowards.
00:46:15 You know, because I remember a while ago,
00:46:17 I made fun of this guy who I'm actually quite fond of,
00:46:19 but he is a boomer.
00:46:20 And he has some silly opinions in my opinion.
00:46:24 This guy, ephemeral rift, ASMR guy on YouTube, whatever.
00:46:26 I like him a lot, but...
00:46:28 Is he the guy who did the mob boss ASMR?
00:46:31 That is based Tirar A. Duweyo, aka Lobster Boy.
00:46:35 No, that is a separate guy.
00:46:37 Both are heroes in very different ways.
00:46:39 Tirar is from Ohio though,
00:46:40 and maybe one day I'll meet up with that guy.
00:46:42 That'd be pretty sick.
00:46:44 But this is a different guy,
00:46:47 and ephemeral rift just...
00:46:50 He is a big anarcho-primitivist guy.
00:46:54 He's like, man, it's just fucked up.
00:46:55 We live in a society, man.
00:46:57 We should be living in the trees, man.
00:46:58 That's what humanity was supposed to be.
00:46:59 Man, that's fucking insane.
00:47:01 That is what a coward is crazy.
00:47:02 I mean, we know he's dumb.
00:47:03 Obviously, he's kind of like...
00:47:05 I know that most of humanity would die.
00:47:07 It's just...
00:47:08 I have sympathy that it feels like we're monkeys
00:47:11 in the wrong environment now,
00:47:12 which I mean, you know, kind of true.
00:47:14 Kind of true.
00:47:15 But you can't go back without killing everybody,
00:47:18 so I don't know what the plan is there.
00:47:19 I mean, that's fucking dumb.
00:47:20 Broader shoulder is not a lighter load, you coward.
00:47:23 Yes, I couldn't agree more.
00:47:24 I couldn't agree more.
00:47:25 Like...
00:47:27 I don't know.
00:47:28 I mean, so he doesn't actually think that we need to do it.
00:47:31 He's just kind of jerking himself off like,
00:47:33 boy, wouldn't it be great if we didn't have society?
00:47:36 I think he would agree with that largely, yeah.
00:47:39 As someone who creates ASMR content on YouTube,
00:47:42 I would assume he's not super sold on the whole idea.
00:47:45 I mean, he totally acknowledged...
00:47:47 He's done some vlogs where he's like,
00:47:49 yeah, I totally acknowledge I do stuff on YouTube.
00:47:53 I mean, he's one of these adult men
00:47:55 who started doing YouTube who has a job
00:47:57 and he does other things, so he doesn't need YouTube.
00:48:00 So that's a little different from our generation
00:48:02 of desperate e-whores trying to make it,
00:48:04 such as myself, you know?
00:48:06 Yeah, we're all guilty.
00:48:08 Yeah, we're all guilty.
00:48:09 Too close to home, man.
00:48:13 In any case, very, very silly in my head.
00:48:15 Now, Lobster Boy, on the other hand,
00:48:17 is an anarcho-capitalist hero who will stop at nothing
00:48:20 to seize the means of control over the world and...
00:48:24 Lobster Boy.
00:48:25 Check out Lobster Boy ASMR, everybody,
00:48:28 if you want a bad time.
00:48:30 I watch a lot of Terrar.
00:48:31 I watch almost anything he makes.
00:48:33 Oh, Terrar, DeGuello.
00:48:35 It took me like a year to figure out how to pronounce his name,
00:48:37 but I did it eventually and...
00:48:40 Degeo?
00:48:41 It's Dewey-o.
00:48:42 Dewey-o.
00:48:43 Terrar A. Dewey-o, which is like...
00:48:45 The lore behind this guy is deep.
00:48:47 Like, that is...
00:48:48 All these older guys...
00:48:49 I follow a lot of older guys on YouTube.
00:48:51 And they all have very...
00:48:53 Kind of like, larping stories about themselves,
00:48:55 but it's still fun to hear and they're mostly true.
00:48:58 And he was given this nickname by a South American friend,
00:49:04 a woman of his.
00:49:05 What, Lobster Boy?
00:49:07 Well, I'm talking about the man who runs the channel,
00:49:09 Terrar A. Dewey.
00:49:10 Lobster Boy is, to clarify, a character,
00:49:13 a horrible character on his channel.
00:49:16 I mean, this is the man who was shouted out by PewDiePie
00:49:18 for doing Pickle Rick ASMR back in the day.
00:49:22 So, you know, he's really...
00:49:23 That's amazing.
00:49:23 He's really hitting the ground running here.
00:49:25 He's got a lot going on.
00:49:26 He's a cool guy, though.
00:49:27 I like him a lot.
00:49:28 But, in any case...
00:49:31 Hey, speaking of the ASMR grind,
00:49:33 you know, ASMR content creation is interesting
00:49:36 and it'll lead into what I was going to say,
00:49:38 which is that like, with those guys,
00:49:40 you can do ASMR on anything.
00:49:42 Like, find a new box to tap.
00:49:44 Boom.
00:49:44 You got your next content.
00:49:45 For your next hour-long video of ASMR,
00:49:48 put an ad at the beginning and the end,
00:49:49 not in the middle.
00:49:50 That is a sin in the ASMR world.
00:49:52 Never do it.
00:49:53 And boom.
00:49:53 And you just keep doing that for years
00:49:55 and it seems to just generally work out pretty well.
00:49:58 Obviously, it's a bit violent.
00:49:59 And the swore slime ASMR when?
00:50:01 I don't know about...
00:50:02 I mean, it generally work out pretty well.
00:50:05 I mean, for the like...
00:50:06 Yeah, you're right.
00:50:06 Dozen guys who are famous for it.
00:50:11 You are correct, Ben.
00:50:12 I am the human.
00:50:13 Dozen guys and thousands of women.
00:50:14 It's a, you know, I feel a certain sense of envy, I suppose,
00:50:20 with like...
00:50:22 A lot of those guys do write scripts.
00:50:23 They'll come up with like characters and do things.
00:50:26 Others do not.
00:50:27 They just kind of do whatever.
00:50:29 But, you know, as opposed to people who are making more
00:50:32 complicated content or whatever.
00:50:34 I'm not even trying to say I'm good or anything.
00:50:36 But here's what I was going to say.
00:50:37 I just...
00:50:37 I am envious of how some of those guys are able to just churn it out
00:50:40 without having to do too much.
00:50:42 But here's what I was going to say.
00:50:44 So I'm leaving tomorrow for like four days away
00:50:47 off the grid or whatever.
00:50:49 I'm still going to be working on some stuff all the way.
00:50:52 But it's, you know, it's like a little mini-vacation.
00:50:54 First kind of dedicated one I've taken in quite a few months.
00:50:57 Except when I visited Digi, to be fair,
00:50:59 that we did actually work while I was there.
00:51:00 Whatever, it doesn't matter.
00:51:02 I feel like I could have stayed at the folks place
00:51:05 for longer.
00:51:06 But I really didn't want to.
00:51:08 Because I just don't want to be away from my computer.
00:51:11 Because I want to be working on things.
00:51:13 Because I have so much desire to make shit.
00:51:16 Are you there now?
00:51:17 No, I'm still in my place.
00:51:19 I'm leaving tomorrow to go.
00:51:20 You're leaving tomorrow?
00:51:21 Okay.
00:51:21 I'll probably get there.
00:51:22 I'm probably going to get there, like,
00:51:24 early on the day of the Eve.
00:51:26 Okay, that's cool.
00:51:27 That's cool.
00:51:28 That's my plan at the moment, anyway.
00:51:30 Sounds good.
00:51:30 I mean, yeah, Michelle and I'll be settling in,
00:51:33 then probably, the day before.
00:51:35 So, like, I was wondering if you guys
00:51:38 feel a similar sense of, like, I suppose
00:51:41 it's not really a guilt.
00:51:42 I mean, we've talked about this for a long time.
00:51:43 I know Jesse's talked about this a lot.
00:51:45 About, like, the pressure to always be working,
00:51:47 that I like, and I don't really want
00:51:49 to not ever be working when I can.
00:51:52 But, I don't know, do you guys,
00:51:54 how do you feel about, like, taking vacations
00:51:55 from your online content creation?
00:51:57 To fill you with nerves?
00:51:58 I don't really feel...
00:51:59 It always feels like a sin.
00:52:00 I don't really feel like anything that I do is work, per se.
00:52:04 I only do things.
00:52:07 Well, with a couple exceptions,
00:52:09 I basically only do things that I feel like doing.
00:52:13 Fair enough.
00:52:15 Like, I don't, like, the poo videos felt like work.
00:52:19 That was me, like, starting a project to be like,
00:52:21 how's this going to pan out?
00:52:23 And I felt like work.
00:52:24 I chugged through it.
00:52:26 Didn't get any, didn't yield much.
00:52:28 It's worth trying.
00:52:29 Those are good.
00:52:30 I enjoyed them.
00:52:31 But, like, slime and punishments,
00:52:32 what I work on mostly now, at this point,
00:52:35 although not for the last couple days.
00:52:37 And that doesn't feel like work.
00:52:40 Yeah, that's cool.
00:52:41 That's cool.
00:52:41 So, I don't know.
00:52:42 I guess I don't feel the same way.
00:52:46 For me, everything is an uphill battle.
00:52:48 Like, left to my own devices, doing what feels good,
00:52:51 I would become 300 pounds and just play video games
00:52:54 and watch anime.
00:52:55 So, everything that it's not that is, like,
00:52:57 an active, like, brain-busting effort.
00:53:00 You know, the funny thing about that, for me,
00:53:02 is that, like, you know, for example,
00:53:04 maybe, I don't know, you guys probably relate to this.
00:53:06 It's like, or, you know, in some form or another.
00:53:08 Like, the weirdest thing is that, like,
00:53:10 I have kind of been having tough, tough time,
00:53:13 making time specifically to get to the gym
00:53:16 for the last couple of months.
00:53:17 Like, I've been going, you know, maybe, like,
00:53:18 once every week, once every two weeks sometimes,
00:53:20 which is not great.
00:53:21 Obviously, that's less than it should be.
00:53:23 But, like, you know, I'm finding time to squeeze it in.
00:53:25 But, like, I have trouble doing it.
00:53:27 I find that the times that I most exercise
00:53:31 is when I'm on vacation.
00:53:33 Because then I'm finally not,
00:53:36 I don't have this thing looming over my head of,
00:53:38 Nate, you could be working on your project right now.
00:53:40 Like, you need to blah, blah, blah, do that.
00:53:43 It's when I am, like, set free.
00:53:45 That's when I most, like, go running and do my lifts
00:53:48 and hit the gym and stuff.
00:53:49 When I've, like, got free time to do that stuff.
00:53:52 I don't know.
00:53:52 I mean, what I did for the gym is I just made it
00:53:55 the priority number one.
00:53:56 Like, as soon as I woke up three times a week,
00:53:59 Monday, Wednesday, Friday, I would go to the gym.
00:54:01 Like, it was more important than work,
00:54:02 it was more important than anything.
00:54:04 Like, that was, because it, for me,
00:54:05 I only went for, like, you know, 45 minutes to an hour.
00:54:07 So, it was not a huge time constraint.
00:54:09 So, like, getting it out of the way early
00:54:10 meant the rest of the day was open to do whatever I wanted.
00:54:12 I absolutely should do that.
00:54:14 But, like, the mental block I keep hitting with that,
00:54:16 I know that the first thing I should do
00:54:17 is wake up and go to the gym.
00:54:19 I feel bad doing that.
00:54:22 And, like, I feel guilty making it priority number one.
00:54:25 Look, I know that a lot of this is, like,
00:54:26 rationalization and it's me being stupid
00:54:28 and I should just do it.
00:54:30 Absolutely true.
00:54:31 And there's no excuse to not do it,
00:54:32 blah, blah, blah, all that stuff.
00:54:33 But, like, when I, the hurdle I encounter is just, like,
00:54:37 I want to get up and get straight to work
00:54:40 on, like, editing and videos and stuff.
00:54:42 And, like, to instead go to the gym,
00:54:44 I just feel such a guilt and, like, a fear
00:54:46 that I'm, like, pushing back, like,
00:54:48 two more hours into the day is when I start editing.
00:54:52 Here's how, because I had that feeling a lot of the time too,
00:54:54 especially at the beginning, before it became habitual.
00:54:56 Right.
00:54:57 The way I justified it was, like, if I get up,
00:55:03 like, I want to go to the gym
00:55:04 because I know it's the right thing to do.
00:55:05 If I don't and I start working,
00:55:08 my work will be tainted by my conflicted mind
00:55:12 going back and forth between, like,
00:55:13 should I go to the gym versus continuing to work?
00:55:16 Whereas if I just do it, I will have mental clarity
00:55:19 and the work will be better because I will no longer be
00:55:21 caught between two brain spaces.
00:55:23 Okay, I understand realizing that in principle,
00:55:26 but there's no fucking way that you actually act rationally,
00:55:30 right?
00:55:31 You're right, Ben.
00:55:31 You're right.
00:55:32 That's my, like, that's me, like, oh, don't you know,
00:55:34 what, just get your homework done early
00:55:37 so that then you won't be, you can relax afterwards
00:55:40 and you'll be happy.
00:55:41 Like, fuck no, I can't do that.
00:55:43 No, I'm gonna fucking want it all night,
00:55:45 but I don't want to fucking do it.
00:55:46 Well, that's mean, Tom.
00:55:47 Six months straight.
00:55:48 Yeah, I'm gonna ruin my whole day.
00:55:49 Once you get into the groove, and I'm not trying to diminish it,
00:55:51 because I was like this too, it, like, after,
00:55:53 let's just say, if you do it for three months,
00:55:55 if you're able to force yourself, then it's a habit.
00:55:57 And then, like, it's basically easy at that point on,
00:56:00 because you've made it just part of your routine.
00:56:02 So that's the place everybody should be aiming to get.
00:56:05 But I have, I have solutions.
00:56:07 A lot of the time these days, because I have this fear
00:56:09 of, like, not doing my work, so I don't go to the gym as much,
00:56:12 what I will do is I'll just say, okay, Michelle,
00:56:15 I know you don't give a shit, which she doesn't.
00:56:17 I'm gonna swear to you, Michelle,
00:56:19 that I will go to the gym tomorrow.
00:56:21 And she's like, I don't care, but okay.
00:56:23 And that's exactly what happens.
00:56:25 And then, once I have someone else involved,
00:56:28 like, holding me to a count, then I actually do it.
00:56:30 Yeah.
00:56:31 That's all it is.
00:56:32 She's really gonna hold your nose for the crying stuff.
00:56:35 It's not about her.
00:56:37 You just gotta tweet it.
00:56:38 You just gotta tweet the night before.
00:56:40 I'm going to the gym tomorrow.
00:56:41 And if you don't, all of your followers
00:56:43 will just blast you for the rest of your life.
00:56:45 If I had, like, a personal Nate account, I would do that.
00:56:48 Since I only basically-
00:56:49 You fucking do.
00:56:49 That's what Twitter is.
00:56:52 I mean, I don't really think of it.
00:56:53 Do you not read it like that?
00:56:54 I do retweet memes and stuff, but I don't know.
00:56:56 Like, I kind of make something of an effort
00:56:58 to make it, like, not particularly personal.
00:57:01 I don't know.
00:57:02 That's just my, how I've been handling it.
00:57:04 Like, maybe I will make, like, a personal Twitter
00:57:06 that's for, like, personal stuff.
00:57:06 Put it in your Discord server or something.
00:57:08 Have all the people who give you money
00:57:10 to know that you are a failure if you don't do it.
00:57:13 You know, I'm sympathetic to this,
00:57:15 and I get your point on it.
00:57:17 It's fair to have the people hold you to a count.
00:57:19 I feel a little bit weird getting, like,
00:57:20 my personal things involved with, like, the people at large.
00:57:23 But I'll tell you what I would do.
00:57:25 Perhaps either of you guys would want to enter
00:57:27 in some sort of illicit demonic pact right now
00:57:30 when it comes to, perhaps for just the first month
00:57:32 of the new year coming up, to swear to,
00:57:35 I mean, my goal, I want to work out three times a week.
00:57:38 And that's what I would hold my,
00:57:39 that's what I would want to hold myself to.
00:57:41 What do you think, Tom, you want to do that?
00:57:43 I mean, I can hold you to a count.
00:57:45 I can't do any working out,
00:57:46 but I will, like, try and hardcore get back on my diet,
00:57:49 and we can hold each other accountable for that.
00:57:50 Okay.
00:57:51 Check in and make sure you're not fucking up.
00:57:52 I will get, I will, I am willing to do that for a diet.
00:57:56 For diets?
00:57:56 Okay, okay.
00:57:56 Working out.
00:57:59 Me and, me and Kazy were working out all the time,
00:58:02 but now she's, like, busy with schools.
00:58:04 And I don't have a gym buddy anymore,
00:58:05 so now I can't bench.
00:58:07 I can't, I can't fucking squat by myself.
00:58:09 I'll fucking die.
00:58:10 You can squat by yourself.
00:58:12 I mean, benching seems more dangerous to me.
00:58:14 That I always worry about executing.
00:58:15 I'll fucking die.
00:58:16 You're trying to kill me.
00:58:16 You just shrug the bar off if you're squatting.
00:58:20 What's the danger there?
00:58:20 This is an assassination attempt.
00:58:23 I mean, I, I never benched with a buddy,
00:58:26 which I know is irresponsible,
00:58:27 and even when I'm alone in the gym,
00:58:28 I'm just willing to roll the dice,
00:58:30 because it's too embarrassing to, like,
00:58:33 use something else.
00:58:34 I'm just willing to die if it comes to it
00:58:36 to avoid any kind of social interaction.
00:58:38 Yeah, but, I mean, there's other people there, right?
00:58:41 Not every time,
00:58:42 because sometimes I work out really late,
00:58:43 and I'm the only person there.
00:58:44 Even if someone's not behind you
00:58:46 with their hands under the bar, like,
00:58:47 light weight, light weight, light weight, light weight,
00:58:50 ain't nothing but a peanut.
00:58:51 If the bar ain't bendin', you just pretendin'.
00:58:56 Even if you're not doing that,
00:58:57 like, as long as someone's there,
00:58:59 you won't die,
00:58:59 because they'll hear you going,
00:59:01 you know, that's the thing.
00:59:02 The bar on your throat.
00:59:03 I haven't thoroughly investigated it.
00:59:04 And they whip out their phones
00:59:05 and record your death instead of helping you.
00:59:07 I'm kind of banking on,
00:59:08 like, because it has happened to me before
00:59:10 that I've been benching back in the day
00:59:12 when I have gone for that extra rep,
00:59:14 and it has been a mistake.
00:59:16 And, well, I mean,
00:59:17 it wouldn't be a mistake if someone was spotting,
00:59:18 but I wasn't able to do it,
00:59:19 and thus I almost died.
00:59:20 But then there's people around who can, you know,
00:59:22 pull it off.
00:59:23 I'm just banking that I'll probably
00:59:25 be able to shrug it off,
00:59:26 or, you know, I don't know.
00:59:28 I'll probably survive, right?
00:59:30 I mean, nobody dies.
00:59:30 Your problem is, like, you're getting older,
00:59:33 and your body will start to break down,
00:59:35 and those gambits will not pay off anymore.
00:59:37 It just, I mean, it happens to everyone.
00:59:40 I mean, you're right.
00:59:40 You gotta pay the piper at some point.
00:59:42 I'm not even doing a thing about, like,
00:59:43 I'm strong enough.
00:59:43 You're livin' on borrowed time now.
00:59:45 I've already been in my life,
00:59:47 in positions where I easily could've died
00:59:49 while lifting.
00:59:50 If there wasn't people to save me.
00:59:52 But then again, like, I wasn't pushed
00:59:53 all the way to the limit, though.
00:59:55 Like, we're talking about situations
00:59:56 where I'm benching.
00:59:57 I don't know.
00:59:58 This is probably back in the day,
00:59:59 going for, like, a round two plate or so,
01:00:02 which was, like, my peak ever,
01:00:03 and I was trying to do it.
01:00:04 I'm below that now, whatever.
01:00:05 And I'm doin' a bench,
01:00:06 and I go for that last rep,
01:00:07 and you're lying on your back.
01:00:08 You got the bar hovering over your face,
01:00:10 and you go down.
01:00:11 You bring it down to, like, onto your chest,
01:00:13 and then you try to push up,
01:00:15 and it will not go,
01:00:16 because you just ran out of steam.
01:00:18 You can't do it.
01:00:18 So, what happens naturally
01:00:20 is it kind of sags back onto your chest,
01:00:22 and it'll naturally kind of roll,
01:00:24 it'll try to roll towards your neck.
01:00:26 And that's where it just will naturally go.
01:00:28 And if it gets there,
01:00:29 it'll crush your throat,
01:00:30 and you'll probably die.
01:00:31 But, like, maybe you could, like,
01:00:33 swing the bar to, like, the right,
01:00:35 and get the thing kind of pushed up.
01:00:38 If you just push,
01:00:39 you're pushing now, like, half the weight,
01:00:40 kind of to the side.
01:00:42 Hopefully it doesn't hit anyone.
01:00:43 I assume things like that will happen
01:00:46 if I'm in that situation.
01:00:47 I've never tried it,
01:00:48 because, obviously, it would be embarrassing.
01:00:50 And you might be out of strength at that point.
01:00:54 I might die.
01:00:55 I could die.
01:00:55 Who knows?
01:00:56 This sounds like a terrible plan.
01:00:58 It is a terrible plan.
01:00:58 I'm just throwing that out there.
01:00:59 But what's the alternative?
01:01:00 Socialize?
01:01:01 Ask for a spotter every time?
01:01:02 No, the plan is just don't
01:01:06 push yourself farther than you can.
01:01:08 That's a pussy plan, Tom.
01:01:09 Or just don't work out alone.
01:01:11 Just work out a place where someone could save you
01:01:13 if you were on lethal scenario.
01:01:15 The easy way around this is just,
01:01:17 I have a 24-hour gym,
01:01:18 but just work out when there's at least one person there,
01:01:21 because if you're going to die,
01:01:22 that person will save you.
01:01:24 And you'll probably make a friend.
01:01:25 So won't that be nice?
01:01:27 I look forward to it.
01:01:32 Indeed.
01:01:33 So speaking of Twitter.
01:01:34 Wait, so are we agreed?
01:01:35 Are we entering the Sacred Pact?
01:01:37 I'm done.
01:01:37 I'm entering the Pact.
01:01:38 I'm entering the Pact right now.
01:01:39 With regards to diet, yeah.
01:01:40 Okay, so you guys are agreeing to stick to your diet.
01:01:43 Let's just make this a time-bound thing
01:01:44 for the month of January.
01:01:46 A month is easy.
01:01:46 30 days, no problem.
01:01:48 Maybe starting now until the end of January.
01:01:50 Or so, I mean, I won't be able to work out.
01:01:52 New years, new years.
01:01:53 Okay, starting new years through the month of January.
01:01:55 We three warriors, we three kings are agreeing to this.
01:02:00 You guys stick to your diet.
01:02:01 I will work out three times a week.
01:02:02 This was my plan already was to get back to diet.
01:02:03 It's not only us.
01:02:04 We are now beholden for the entire PCP audience.
01:02:08 That's true.
01:02:08 That's able to hear this.
01:02:09 Goddamn.
01:02:10 And if we can make it through this month,
01:02:11 that's a long way to setting the routine,
01:02:13 which is exactly what I want to do.
01:02:14 If you can make it through a month,
01:02:16 it's basically, you're basically set.
01:02:17 You're on cruise control.
01:02:18 Yeah, absolutely.
01:02:18 So, hey folks, if you want to also,
01:02:21 perhaps post in the comments below,
01:02:23 something that you want other people
01:02:24 to hold you to account for.
01:02:25 Perhaps you'd find that useful.
01:02:26 I don't know, up to you.
01:02:27 It's not a bad idea.
01:02:28 There it is.
01:02:28 This is the healthy bro pact.
01:02:30 So it shall be, so it shall be.
01:02:31 Three times a week for me, as soon as possible.
01:02:34 So, I guess speaking of keeping yourself healthy,
01:02:38 I think I want to back off from Twitter.
01:02:41 I hate it.
01:02:42 I hate Twitter so much.
01:02:43 It's so bad and so terrible.
01:02:46 I agree.
01:02:46 I've said multiple times that Twitter
01:02:48 is a net negative for society.
01:02:50 This is why, I think Ben,
01:02:51 I think we probably feel similarly.
01:02:53 This is why I just made a conscious choice
01:02:55 to just make it like an anime girl image thing for me.
01:02:59 That's like all it is.
01:03:00 And also, my friends will tweet.
01:03:01 And even they fuck it up sometimes.
01:03:03 I don't know, it's like, it's the platform
01:03:06 that I have like the most, you know,
01:03:08 I got like 5k followers, almost 6k.
01:03:11 Yeah.
01:03:12 Making a tweet is not an effort
01:03:14 like making a video or something.
01:03:16 I just, you know, I want to talk,
01:03:18 I want to say stuff and have people hear it.
01:03:20 That's like, that's where I go.
01:03:24 I don't like it.
01:03:27 Fuck you, don't like it.
01:03:28 I was on there, I saw the fucking J.K. Rowling.
01:03:30 J.K. Rowling getting all turfy on Twitter.
01:03:33 And I was like, I'm fucking upset about this.
01:03:36 And I say so on Twitter and everyone hates me.
01:03:38 The long story short, everybody hates me.
01:03:41 Lose 20 people unsubscribed from me.
01:03:44 You're wading into tumultuous waters
01:03:46 every time you talk about those kinds of things.
01:03:49 And I'm not saying you shouldn't,
01:03:51 I'm just saying that kind of comes, unfortunately,
01:03:52 with the territory.
01:03:53 Is that when you plant your flag on something,
01:03:55 you're going to get blowback from people who destroy you.
01:03:56 That's what Twitter's for.
01:03:58 Is that not what I don't understand?
01:03:59 Well, all I'm saying is, all I'm saying is,
01:04:03 that's what Twitter's for.
01:04:04 I'm using it as intended.
01:04:06 The results are horrible and make me feel bad.
01:04:08 That's why Twitter, as intended, is a bad platform,
01:04:11 which is why I never make political tweets ever.
01:04:13 That's what I was, look, I just think that Twitter
01:04:16 and a lot of the things, I just think this,
01:04:18 it's not a fault of anyone.
01:04:18 This wasn't intended.
01:04:20 But I think it's just as a result
01:04:22 of the world that we're in now, the digital age,
01:04:24 just like the most contentious arguments
01:04:27 and people's biggest disagreements
01:04:29 are the things that get propagated.
01:04:31 And just as a result, it just makes everybody more mad
01:04:33 and more sad and stuff.
01:04:34 Even though, I think I was saying last time,
01:04:37 I think we all agree on most stuff,
01:04:39 but that's just not what gets discussed.
01:04:41 No, I don't think, I used to believe that.
01:04:44 I don't think so anymore.
01:04:45 Okay, maybe I'm wrong.
01:04:46 Maybe I'm wrong.
01:04:47 I mean, that's what Twitter does, though.
01:04:48 It skews your perspective.
01:04:50 Like, what's that game or that video or whatever
01:04:53 that shows like the anger machine?
01:04:55 It's like a game where one person-
01:04:56 Is it a CGP gray video that's like the meme?
01:05:00 Like the anger meme?
01:05:01 I think I'm actually thinking of a video game
01:05:02 that was designed to simulate like how anger spreads
01:05:06 or something.
01:05:07 The one of like the crowds watching the news and like-
01:05:09 Yes, yes, exactly.
01:05:10 Yeah, I know the one you're-
01:05:11 I actually, I landed on that GameDev's Patreon page
01:05:16 the other day, like totally randomly.
01:05:18 Yeah.
01:05:18 Um, I don't know why.
01:05:19 Do you have a name or the name of the game or anything?
01:05:21 Oh, god.
01:05:22 I'm gonna Google it.
01:05:23 Oh, wait, it's-
01:05:23 Ignored you were talking about that.
01:05:24 She has another game called like Adventures in Anxiety, I think.
01:05:28 Oh, I know that game.
01:05:29 I think it's by the same person.
01:05:31 Really?
01:05:32 I didn't know they made anything else.
01:05:33 Yeah, yeah.
01:05:34 They had a, Nicky Case is the developer and the old game
01:05:40 that you're talking about is, uh, ooh, ah, ooh, what the fuck?
01:05:47 I'm looking at her, oh, uh, I'm scrolling down her page.
01:05:51 She's got a lot of cool games here, looking real good, but I don't-
01:05:55 Oh, uh, what we have, we become what we behold.
01:05:58 Here it is.
01:05:59 Yes, found it.
01:05:59 That's the one, that's the one.
01:06:01 Here, I will, I will link it in the show notes for everybody.
01:06:04 I think you can play it right here.
01:06:05 Yeah, yeah, you can.
01:06:06 It takes five minutes.
01:06:07 I love those games.
01:06:09 Yeah.
01:06:10 So, I mean, this, uh, yeah, it's pretty much,
01:06:12 this is the phenomenon that I think social media propagates to some degree.
01:06:17 And, uh, that's-
01:06:19 It's tough.
01:06:19 It does.
01:06:20 Tough.
01:06:20 It definitely does that.
01:06:25 I don't know.
01:06:26 I don't like it.
01:06:26 That's it?
01:06:27 I mean, yeah.
01:06:28 Man, I'm upset.
01:06:28 I'm, makes me upset and I don't want to do it anymore.
01:06:31 And, and you know, the other thing is, I think that-
01:06:33 And I guess it's just my good fortune that I've come to the point in slime and punishment
01:06:36 where I have to take a break to make the next big update.
01:06:39 So, I don't really have to post very much there anymore.
01:06:41 So, maybe I won't.
01:06:42 That's fair enough.
01:06:43 And, uh, it, it makes me think back to the curious case of the Spoony One.
01:06:47 How he just, I, I don't know his full story.
01:06:50 I don't know everything about it, but like, you can, and I feel this myself.
01:06:54 Like, you see, there's like a sliding scale about like someone starts off being like a YouTuber.
01:06:59 Then they start to stream.
01:07:01 Then they just start to tweet.
01:07:02 And like, like things devolve.
01:07:04 Like, they stop putting effort in and we see less and less good things from them.
01:07:08 And I feel that there's a pressure on almost everybody to do this.
01:07:11 Like, I've been streaming more.
01:07:12 I'm doing my Nuzlocke now.
01:07:14 It's fun.
01:07:15 But like, I, I think, I feel that people are here for me.
01:07:19 The only reason anybody follows me is for like videos of enjoyment.
01:07:22 Maybe they think I have an interesting perspective.
01:07:24 Fair enough.
01:07:25 But like, they're not following me for, I don't know, like anything outside that realm.
01:07:29 And so I just, I try to put that as my focus of what I, like that's always should be my top
01:07:35 priority, I think, for what I give to the world and some online space.
01:07:40 Yeah.
01:07:40 I mean, I thought that everyone followed me for comics, but now I've been like doing slime
01:07:45 and punishment and like, nobody gives a shit.
01:07:47 So I don't know.
01:07:48 I mean, maybe people just don't follow me for any reason.
01:07:50 It's a very, it's kind of punishment.
01:07:50 It's pretty niche, dude.
01:07:52 Like, you know.
01:07:52 Yeah, but it's a comic.
01:07:54 And I, I don't know.
01:07:56 I don't get it.
01:07:57 I don't get it.
01:07:58 Well, I, I, I think.
01:07:59 I don't get why everyone isn't as excited about slime and punishment.
01:08:02 Slime and punishment is on Twitter and Twitter is a terrible place to host content.
01:08:06 It's not only on Twitter.
01:08:07 It comes out on Twitter first, but like it's on all the other fucking platforms that a
01:08:11 comic can be on.
01:08:11 Do people, do, do our like sphere of influence like frequent those sites?
01:08:16 It just seems like I've never been on the, on like webtoon ever.
01:08:20 I think this is part of the equation.
01:08:22 It's not a site in my rotation.
01:08:23 Do you, do you think that people would want to read it more if, if like when I get around
01:08:28 to putting it on stcomics.com?
01:08:30 Cause I would assume so.
01:08:31 I think so.
01:08:32 I do.
01:08:32 I do.
01:08:32 I mean, that is, that is the plan, like to eventually, once it's done, put it on
01:08:36 stcomics.com.
01:08:37 I mean, for now, okay, whatever.
01:08:39 For now it's readable exactly as it will be on stcomics.com on tapas and webtoon.
01:08:48 I mean, I guess if you don't like those platforms, whatever, I don't.
01:08:52 I mean, it's not about like, it's just about.
01:08:53 I don't see what's off putting about the way that it's presented.
01:08:56 I feel like tapas and webtoon are good for like expanding your audience.
01:08:59 Cause you know, those are discovery platforms.
01:09:01 You would think so, but no.
01:09:04 Well, that's my whole thing.
01:09:05 Cause I think, I think slime and punishment is like, it's, I guess like it, it's sort
01:09:09 of an insular work.
01:09:10 Like there's just so much like going into it, you need to like be aware of.
01:09:14 Otherwise it's just gibberish, you know?
01:09:16 So like, it's not going to do very well on a discovery platform.
01:09:18 I don't know that it is.
01:09:19 Cause like it explains itself perfectly well.
01:09:23 I don't know.
01:09:24 I feel like even if you'd never heard of endless war, you could read it and like,
01:09:27 you would still understand what's happening.
01:09:29 Maybe, I mean, possibly, I don't know.
01:09:33 It's hard for me to really even gauge just because I do know the context.
01:09:36 Honestly, I took pains.
01:09:38 I took pains to explain everything.
01:09:39 Cause like sort of, uh, I mean, at this point, maybe it's a little beyond that,
01:09:43 but especially for like the first couple chapters of it for the first while, like it's
01:09:49 Slam and Punishment is sort of designed to be an introduction to endless war.
01:09:54 And that's why you have like the humble juve.
01:09:57 It's like explaining how mining works and stuff like that.
01:10:00 It's sort of supposed to be a gateway.
01:10:03 Not a thing that is gated by entry.
01:10:06 I don't know.
01:10:07 Maybe there's just needs to be more.
01:10:09 If you can get them to, if you can get a human being to page one of Slam and Punishment to read
01:10:14 it, I mean, I'm obviously biased and I know the source, so I can't judge for everybody,
01:10:17 but I think they'll get a lot of it.
01:10:18 The art is good.
01:10:19 The story is fun.
01:10:20 That's what I think.
01:10:21 Honestly, that's the problem.
01:10:22 How do you get them there?
01:10:23 I mean, I just think that's the, that's the real issue, whatever that is.
01:10:26 Well, I mean, I have gotten some readers front on like fucking um, uh,
01:10:32 dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirt, on those platforms.
01:10:36 I have gotten some.
01:10:38 I was, you know, just not maybe like, maybe like a hundred, maybe like some,
01:10:42 probably less, maybe less than a hundred, which is like, I mean, that's cool.
01:10:46 I guess yeah, I think that slime and punishment even with it's like exposition is still a denser harder to penetrate work than the Vapors or the champion
01:10:56 It's more complicated. There's more that would be the case, but I mean I
01:11:00 Think it's just because like the Vapors and the champion are both self-contained works like designed to just be themselves
01:11:07 Whereas slime and punishment is a tie-in for endless war and Chris Chen which are both like you need to understand both of those
01:11:14 I think that there's in a wider context to fully appreciate what's going on in slime and punishment
01:11:18 I mean that's partially true and that definitely helps the understanding
01:11:21 But I think that there's like a slight
01:11:23 Like misunderstanding here because I think that what Tom's speaking to which I agree with is that like
01:11:29 Knowing the general idea of what slime and punishment is can be intimidating when you think like oh man
01:11:35 It's like a Chris and an rfck and a t-bap and a pony. Yeah
01:11:38 You don't need to know who Chris is or who nightstar is to like understand what like the premise which is that
01:11:45 But knowing who they are makes the comic much more appealing. I mean just consider for example. Why have just take one example
01:11:50 I assume this is true. Why hasn't Digi red slime and punishment because I don't think he has I
01:11:56 Can answer that it's because he's intimidated by those factors. I mean, you know Digi's a very easily intimidated man
01:12:02 Like it's cuz he doesn't he like he doesn't hear his lack of moral character
01:12:07 He doesn't like I mean he doesn't identify as someone who like understands rfck
01:12:12 So I think like just knowing it's that's involved makes him be turned off
01:12:16 Whereas like the vapors what do you need to know you need to know what like a human going to school is okay?
01:12:20 I think we all you know we get that and that's not easy to read
01:12:24 It's just that's a that's an aura around it of perhaps an intimidating, you know, just set like I imagine digi
01:12:31 Might be among that set of people who yeah, not gonna read it while it's still being made
01:12:36 But once I can I say like okay, so I'm the punishment's done. It's over. It's complete
01:12:40 Then he maybe he goes in because you know, that's that was basically me with them
01:12:45 Bail jpe was like I was aware of it as it was happening, but I didn't really sit down and read it until hippo was like it's done
01:12:51 I think that like the main thing when I hear like a comic like okay
01:12:56 If you already care about any of the things that are involved in there
01:12:59 You'll probably be interested for for many reasons
01:13:01 But like in order to get like a new audience the the thing that should probably lead is like here is an awesome comic
01:13:07 That's really cool with great art, etc. And also it's tied into these other things that are also cool if you which I think it is
01:13:15 I got a lot of enjoyment out of it. So yeah, yeah, that's exactly what it's that's exactly what it's meant to be
01:13:20 Yeah, that was the that was the goal. Mm-hmm. So I
01:13:23 I understand I get that like if you know if you know who if you're invested in
01:13:29 Chris Chan, yeah, and you know who nightstar is and you think that that's funny
01:13:33 Like I get that that would heighten the enjoyment of it for you
01:13:37 My hope is that it's not something that you cannot enjoy without
01:13:41 Knowing the context or same for like endless war, right? Yeah, I think you can it's just a harder sell at that point
01:13:48 A harder sell explain the slower and I don't really think it's about the quality of the comic
01:13:54 Like you are interested in endless war. I think it's a must read if you are interested
01:13:59 Yeah, I think it's a must read because Chris is like involved in its creation in a sort of
01:14:05 Semi and occasionally direct way indeed
01:14:09 And other than that, it's I think I don't know to me it's has got everything
01:14:14 It's got everything it needs to stand on its own. I don't know. That's just my opinion
01:14:18 I I still think this is a this is a marketing question as it is probably for most
01:14:26 Maybe not most but you know, ironically marketing is the most important skill in the world. Yeah, probably probably
01:14:32 Tragically, but I'm terrible at it. Unfortunately
01:14:35 Which explains pretty much everything since we're all competing for eyes in this cruel internet digital age arbitrage economy
01:14:42 On that side, we've got voicemails we could go to if you guys want to unless you want to talk about anything else
01:14:53 No, I think it's fine. I think I've said enough for a lifetime
01:14:58 Yeah, yeah, did you say anime podcast rolls right along with more hits?
01:15:05 Let's uh, all right, let's let's go to them. Let me see
01:15:08 We've got voicemails people you left them for us link down below to the speak pipe thing
01:15:14 Record them leaves the name etc etc
01:15:16 Okay, here we go. First one is
01:15:19 From will it hold up is our first one here and let's find out if it will go
01:15:26 Okay, so I'm probably way too early with this
01:15:29 But I recently listened to the pcp episode 100. You know, it was one of the greats
01:15:36 Right next besides the drug episode or the yellow episode or even the legendary virginity cast
01:15:43 It was fucking live on the couch. It was epic. What about fucking French? It was magic. I mean friendship
01:15:50 so
01:15:52 I've calculated and
01:15:54 The pcp episode number 200 will be on the
01:15:58 Will be released on the 28th of February. So how the fuck are you gonna hold up?
01:16:03 I mean red con 4
01:16:06 Probably isn't gonna be in February. So
01:16:09 What you're gonna do about it?
01:16:10 Shit, he's got the first thing this calls to mind for me is like how the fuck
01:16:15 Has it already been so long since episode 100?
01:16:18 when
01:16:19 Like which was at rad com 3 it just makes rad com 3 feel like an era ago like a like a
01:16:25 A million years kind of was dude. We're going into like two years since right
01:16:29 Yeah, like the last the Kickstarter launched in february of 2018
01:16:35 Yeah, so we're getting close to two years. We're going into 2020 dude march 2020 will be two years since
01:16:41 We kind of meant to do them once a year, didn't we did we fuck up pretty much?
01:16:45 Have we have we we missed this entire year, dude?
01:16:47 I mean there were extenuating circumstances, but yes, I mean, you know, it's uh, it's on us to a degree
01:16:52 I mean entirely 100 but uh, okay. So the answer is
01:16:56 I don't think our like I've been thinking about this too. I respect you doing the math figuring these things out
01:17:01 I also looked up this uh, this ahead of time
01:17:04 February is probably not a great time to do
01:17:07 Anything to get get together
01:17:09 So I doubt we will do any kind of in-person meeting, but uh, I don't know we should we'll we'll perhaps think
01:17:15 Wasn't it in the chat? When we talk about march?
01:17:19 Yeah, but that's not february. That'd be uh, that'd be a little late. This is this is the plan. All right
01:17:23 This is what we're gonna have to do
01:17:25 The week before episode 200 we'll do episode 199. Then we'll do episode 200 one
01:17:31 Yes, and we will just skip 200 until rad con four
01:17:35 Where the legendary missing episode 200 will search for 200. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah people will be so confused when they're looking through their feed
01:17:43 They're like, why is I missing an episode? What happened here?
01:17:46 Fuck the viewers played them
01:17:49 That pretty much sums it up
01:17:51 So I we will think about this. I'll uh, we'll keep you posted keep your eyes peeled around february rad con four temporally
01:17:58 confirmed
01:17:59 Rad con fourth dimension
01:18:01 We control time. All right. Let's uh, go to our next voicemail. This is uh
01:18:06 Keyblade spirit names a meme interpreter. Okay, right. Let's uh
01:18:12 Oh, don't we all these days take it away
01:18:15 Okay, pcp. I need your help
01:18:17 I found this spicy meme at the end of a dosion that I need your help interpreting
01:18:23 Oh, no
01:18:24 The text says this h-manga was translated by two cooked for you gang we
01:18:30 Okay more translations no virus act and then the url
01:18:37 And the picture is a picture of heath ledger's joker
01:18:41 and there's a an arrow
01:18:44 So
01:18:45 Pointing from the joker. Why are you asking us a red circle?
01:18:50 Around an arabic looking guy. I think it's just a stock photo and it's got some arabic words
01:18:56 at the top of that and then
01:18:58 Another meme inside of this meme
01:19:01 It's this guy with looking real surprised
01:19:05 Going
01:19:09 And then inside that meme there's another meme that says bra moment
01:19:13 And then there's a minecraft skin
01:19:15 of the arabic looking guy from before
01:19:18 And he's standing to the right of
01:19:21 naked thanos
01:19:24 What
01:19:26 That's he should have put a link to this so we could actually see what does this mean? Yeah, okay does it mean?
01:19:31 I'll uh, we should help me. I'm gonna I'm gonna reach out. I'm gonna see if he can
01:19:36 Yeah, this is too dense. We don't have visual. He did not provide one boomer for this
01:19:40 Unfortunately, you should have put the fucking link or something in uh, you're the name of your voicemail
01:19:45 Do you guys want to feel boomer today is december 22nd?
01:19:48 I saw a post on twitter today saying it is the 15th anniversary of like the first official youtube poop. Really fascinating dude
01:19:55 Undertale can vote now
01:19:58 Feel old yet feel old yet. Oh, there it is. Yeah. Yeah
01:20:03 Yes, I do but for a completely unrelated I can't interpret that meme
01:20:07 But I will ask you on twitter later to give us a link to that
01:20:10 So perhaps at least the people can can work it out for themselves what they're seeing
01:20:14 Uh, yeah, look in the comments for the answer. Let me see here. Uh next voicemail. Oh, uh, this one is a star wars question mark
01:20:23 Okay, let's uh take it away
01:20:26 Hey
01:20:27 Is any of you gonna see that new star wars film? No
01:20:31 I know I am I like star wars. Does anyone in the pcp make star wars?
01:20:37 You know
01:20:38 I already did see the movie. I saw it yesterday when I heard this voicemail
01:20:41 I was going to be like, I don't think any of us has seen the new movie
01:20:46 Or gives a shit. I certainly don't but then tom had actually happened to see it yesterday
01:20:50 What would you think tom tells the story? Uh
01:20:54 I mean
01:20:55 Do the story is that I had every intention of either watching it when it came out on like video or
01:21:01 Watching a cam whichever happened across my desk first
01:21:05 But then forgotten paladin in my patreon server is like here's 30 bucks
01:21:09 I want you to go see it and shit on it. I'm like
01:21:12 Uh, okay, it's a heavy burden. I bear but I I'll I'll carry this cross. I suppose
01:21:17 So I went to saw the movie and uh, it was pretty dumb. I was so sure
01:21:22 I didn't like it. Yeah, it's gonna be a totally
01:21:24 Non-controversial like just like give it a standard fucking ending just like do do empire again
01:21:32 You know just just uh soft to reboot it like they did with with force awakens
01:21:37 Just make it I don't think there was any like they had rocked the boat and like robbed it of all
01:21:42 I mean, look, I did not see the last one
01:21:43 I saw the force awakens and I thought it was okay
01:21:45 But like my understanding is that they fucked things up so that there was really no way to make it satisfying
01:21:51 To the public. I thought it was gonna be I mean the movie the movie does heavy damage control for last
01:21:57 Unsurprising like if I was gonna sum up like I did I did a 45 minute podcast that you can list to for a dollar a month at patreon.com
01:22:03 So it's called station 2 link in the description. Check it out. It's fucking sick
01:22:07 This was my contractual obligation to accepting this 30 dollars to see this movie was to make a podcast
01:22:12 But um, if I was gonna like sum up the disney trilogy is in a word
01:22:15 Uh, the force awakens would be uh inoffensive
01:22:20 Uh, last Jedi would be insulting and this movie would just be retarded
01:22:25 Uh, that that's really how like because the movie is like an almost all
01:22:29 Sequence of set pieces and when it's just like explosions and blasters and lightsabers. That's pretty cool
01:22:34 But every time I try and move the plot around along it just gets progressively stupider
01:22:39 And it's just like I can't believe this is happening and they thought this was okay
01:22:42 Like there's times where a character is just like I have a feeling we should do this and it's like plot integral
01:22:47 And there's no reason why it's just it's just the worst insult I can give it is simply that I lost interest after
01:22:53 You know the force awakens. I was like, yeah, I mean, you know, whatever sure
01:22:57 Enjoy. Yeah, I mean, I've never been a huge star wars fan
01:23:00 The trilogy is based I watched them back in the day
01:23:03 They were good, but it's not like I've never been like I'm gonna buy star wars merchandise
01:23:07 And I'm gonna like go see star wars opening day. I just like you know me and my buddy went to uh,
01:23:11 I think we missed the grand opening of the phantom menace, but we saw opening night the uh episode two and episode three
01:23:18 Because we were uh, we were way into it, but uh, I mean that was before
01:23:22 Like I just I just that was before my brain awoke
01:23:25 Uh, you know, like there was I I talked about this and there was an event like the first time I saw garen logon
01:23:31 And the first time I saw ghost nashel. I was still a young man
01:23:33 Then at some point in college my brain awoke and I realized actually I like I remember the last thing I saw
01:23:40 Before my brain awoke was my first watching of kill like kill
01:23:44 After that and I still I've been meaning to go back and watch that again
01:23:47 Then I watched garen logon again and I'm like, oh now I get it then I watched ghost nashel
01:23:50 And I'm like, oh this isn't shit. This is actually good and and et cetera, et cetera
01:23:55 Um, so uh, that all the star wars prequels I saw before that
01:23:59 But of course I seen red letter median all those things
01:24:01 Anyway, I don't think any of us really care about star wars. Uh, so
01:24:06 Just nope next question
01:24:09 Next question it is we've got uh, oh ben you're gonna be happy to hear this. We've got uh
01:24:14 Fido vizipops dog is calling in with a message for the progress

01:24:33 Fuck dogs. Yeah, that's what you want us to think and I'm sure you're uh, probably sad to hear that been saying, you know
01:24:39 You did a call right but hey man, think about how I feel

01:25:07 Please they don't let us have twitter accounts
01:25:09 Bark bark, which is very speed. Yeah, make me the first. I want to be the first one to know. Um, I think he's lying
01:25:16 Um, I think he's just doesn't want us to I think he wants to spread the misinformation that this isn't going on
01:25:24 It's part of the jewish conspiracy to uh, to uh
01:25:28 Well dogs are loyal and why would you want your master? He just he just doesn't want us to build the wall between
01:25:35 America and the dog nation
01:25:38 He doesn't want to know that they're coming over they're coming over the border and stealing our jobs stealing our women yada yada yada
01:25:44 Y'all know it y'all know it. Mm-hmm sound off. We know
01:25:48 Sound off. We want a human only
01:25:53 All right next try to answer the dq
01:25:59 All right next voicemail is from uh, this is uh, harlock aznebel who if you don't remember folks
01:26:04 He's the one who uh got the um, the the gf from anime club his little brother
01:26:10 Got a gf an anime club and if you recall he made a bet between
01:26:13 I mean he made a bet saying if he kept the gf
01:26:17 He would give you tons of fun bucks on patreon and if he lost the gf
01:26:21 Oh, wait, no, no, if he lost he would give it to you if he kept it he would give it to me
01:26:26 He came up with this
01:26:28 But that's uh, that's what he did well. Do I recall?
01:26:32 Indeed indeed. You're up to speed viewers. Uh, let's hear uh, how things are going for him harlock. Take it away
01:26:38 So ben saint wins the bet
01:26:40 Yeah
01:26:42 Fuck
01:26:43 I don't have his money yet because uh, I thought this would at least last till past christmas
01:26:48 But it actually ended literally the second the semester of my college ended. So
01:26:54 Fuck was he right?
01:26:56 I mean, I guess he's always right. He's right. This is me to can presume when college everything
01:27:01 I suppose it makes sense that you wouldn't be wrong here either praise papa saint
01:27:05 Anyway, uh, I don't want people to get the wrong idea and think anime club gfs are a bad idea all around
01:27:12 Brothers
01:27:14 His girlfriend get along really well. So
01:27:17 It is possible. Yeah, we'll see about that. You know, don't don't rule it out entirely
01:27:22 Yeah, but but yeah, I didn't say when
01:27:26 Didn't last till February
01:27:30 Didn't even last till christmas
01:27:33 This is cause for celebration
01:27:36 Yeah, everybody wins the problem was entirely in the framing you should and you don't go to anime club looking for a gf
01:27:42 You go to anime club looking for a quick fuck. That's what you do
01:27:46 You fucking pervert you go to anime club looking for anime for fuck's sake
01:27:50 No, no, no, no, no, no, no
01:27:53 I go to mia.si if i'm looking for anime. Uh, there's um indeed indeed. There's um, what was I gonna say?
01:27:59 Something about oh, right. I mean, okay. Now that we're in where we're past relate. We're post relationship here
01:28:04 It's time for the period of reflection. I mean obviously we never met this girl
01:28:08 We didn't know the nature of the relationship the fact that you were so unceremoniously dropped at the end of the semester like
01:28:15 We that just reveals that this relationship was obviously
01:28:19 Nothing of substance. It was an it was an anime relationship. The worst time
01:28:24 Inherently unstable like a like a like a radioactive isotope
01:28:28 Exactly, although, you know, what what's his face the young brother harlock bronable is is keeping his life
01:28:34 So good for him, but uh as far as we know
01:28:37 So he left another message actually that uh, I'm over there playing but he was saying that like, you know
01:28:42 Like what should I do about like my next relationship? I mean, I think you should you should reflect
01:28:47 It sounded like this was his first relationship. Okay. I don't know
01:28:51 You're like, whatever. I mean, he was saying like don't don't do anything. It's fine
01:28:55 He was asking questions like like how long should I wait? Is it weird to move on? Okay, like what this is feeling? No, it's fine
01:29:01 Don't worry. Don't worry about anything
01:29:03 Harlock and there's no shame in it. It's all good. But like obviously you don't know what you're doing here
01:29:07 And that's fine. I forgive you for that
01:29:09 But you forgive him
01:29:11 Like yeah, he knew he obviously didn't understand the relationship
01:29:15 He just had if it was so flimsy all along and was so easy for it to dissolve
01:29:19 It sounds like you had much more emotional investment than she did if if you're like reflecting on like what do I do now?
01:29:25 I mean did this man sound like he was that emotionally invested when he was making bets online about how long
01:29:31 Maybe there's he's just beaming with pride. Um, who knows? Yeah, yeah, it's a mystery. Um, don't worry about it
01:29:37 Whatever. Yeah, I mean, there's nothing to worry about here dawg. It's fine. Just do it again
01:29:42 Yeah, you have come and go but anime club is absolutely right tom
01:29:46 Harlock, yeah, don't overthink it. Obviously this relationship wasn't that big a deal to her. Keep going to anime club
01:29:52 Yeah, don't let her win. Don't let her take anime club
01:29:55 Don't let them see
01:29:58 Anime club was always meant for me
01:30:01 That's right
01:30:02 You can meet your else out there. Oh, hey, have you guys seen frozen 2 or heard about it by any chance?
01:30:06 No, I saw big Joel's video about it
01:30:08 What what did he think? I'm curious. He I think he thought it was weird in a good way
01:30:13 Michelle saw it yesterday. I wasn't there. She saw it. I'm kind of regret not seeing it with her
01:30:19 I was just I'm a stream at the time or whatever
01:30:21 But like she said it was weird and michelle
01:30:24 She kind of loves frozen one and it was just like this was weird and like there was like superpowers and weird elemental things
01:30:29 And they give the mom a weird backstory that was obviously not intended from the start
01:30:34 Uh, a bunch of weird stuff seems like they took like the trailer blocking blockbuster ever
01:30:39 and they fucking uh
01:30:42 Went fucking weird weird bizarre place with it
01:30:46 It was so clearly not intended for a sequel and part of the charm of like a big temple disney movie
01:30:52 Is like like just for example, like I mean moana is a dope ass hawaii island movie
01:30:56 Like there's a whole culture. There's like a bunch of like, you know songs relevant to the period and whatnot
01:31:00 Obviously frozen was like, I don't know sweeten or whatever
01:31:04 It's like themed around that old land and just like making a sequel is like, okay
01:31:08 None so we don't get any new stuff like that
01:31:10 They're just like adding details to characters that we didn't care about in the first place
01:31:15 And they're trying to put together something that was never intended
01:31:18 Trying to give characters arcs that don't do it. I'm just I'm hearing this whole second hand from michelle
01:31:22 So I don't know what I'm talking about but like I mean line king two and a half one and a half
01:31:27 Now there was a sequel for the ages that filled out characters. We cared about that we had deep connection with
01:31:32 Uh, it did not fuck up the lore any in a serious way
01:31:35 Uh, I'm I'm lying but they say line king two is good. You said that tom, right? You're a fan
01:31:41 I thought I mean I watched it as a much younger
01:31:45 Child but I remember enjoying it at the time
01:31:47 You know, I'm still mad at those motherfuckers are trying to lie to us and pretend that that kid who's exactly looks like scar
01:31:52 Isn't scar's son. It's the most retarded ass thing they've ever tried to come up with
01:31:57 He's obviously scar's son
01:31:59 The weirdest thing is that they have a new television show called the lion guard
01:32:04 That entire movie never happened video about that
01:32:07 I did
01:32:11 You made it look like real tempting
01:32:14 Uh, yeah, you may I was on
01:32:18 I mean if you want to watch I there's apparently in like a later episode like the the character bongo
01:32:23 Who's that like farting guy made a fart joke. They have like a love scene with farting. I like farting. No
01:32:29 This I wish I was lying. I've been told second hand. I've not seen it, but this is what I've heard
01:32:34 That's that's somebody's fucking
01:32:37 Life's dream to see that brappers unite our people are being represented last like like wet dream
01:32:44 Realized beyond their wildest imagination
01:32:47 I mean sometimes right the animators fetishes leak through that's this is definitely an example of that
01:32:53 Indeed we're all richer disgusting
01:32:56 All right, that's one word for it. Uh, what do we got here? We got uh, uh nuzlocke deep lore
01:33:03 Kill hoot hoot is is is is said here. Let's how mysterious. Let's find out what that's about. Go wait
01:33:10 Tell me something is it true that team rocket has returned? Yeah

01:33:46 They will be crushed by my venture capitalist fingers
01:33:50 I hate them all you say out of my way
01:33:53 You won't be an exception if you get in my way too juicy. Oh
01:33:57 That's it me. Uh, that's that's famous
01:33:59 Rival to me in the heart gold nuzlocke a voicemail god calling in
01:34:04 Uh neocapitalist monster trying to talk shit and get hit sounds like sounds like him

01:34:19 Watch out for him guys. He's around
01:34:22 He's a rough character. Don't cut yourself on that edge. I fucking love silver as a rival in in silver and gold is a

01:35:13 But uh, that that hypnosis has been extremely useful
01:35:17 Hell and even catching all kinds of great pokes
01:35:19 So ben saint the hood who's actually been putting in some good workforce over on the next lock
01:35:23 So nothing could make me happier other than other than a heroic death that lets me go god tier

01:42:22 All right, that's it. Thanks for being here everybody. This is the last episode of this year
01:42:26 So we'll see you in 2019. Hey if you're doing any you want to do any join us on our quest to
01:42:30 Whatever fucking uh fitness or otherwise. Uh new year goals
01:42:34 Bullshit make it make a man goals are tough. Make it time-bound. Just do something for a month, man
01:42:39 Once you're there then see how you feel. Um, anyone can do anything for a month, right?
01:42:43 I empower you to take the challenge whatever it is you're trying to do make it reasonable michelle michelle said
01:42:48 I'm gonna read a hundred books next year. That's too high. Don't set it unrealistically. That's like two books a week
01:42:54 It is
01:42:55 Yeah, that's way too high like I mean she could do picture books or something small
01:42:58 So you got to do like a book a week is even even that's probably too many when you said it was her
01:43:03 I assume that's what she meant
01:43:05 I mean she she had this idea in her head that I argued against so she's like
01:43:08 But if I set the goal super duper high then like I'll get close and I'll still read tons of books
01:43:13 I'm like that's not how goals work. Once you will fail and give up once you break
01:43:16 Yeah, once you break the expectation of keeping the goal
01:43:19 Yeah, exactly
01:43:21 That's the thing. So don't do that folks time-bounded. There's a really good acronym that I forget
01:43:25 It's like time-bounded something something like attainable love a lot whatever
01:43:30 Whatever that is do that. It's like star or something. So, uh, all right. Anyway, we're done here folks
01:43:35 We'll see you in 2020, baby, and it's going to be a great time. Oh, yeah, 10 more years of pcp
01:43:41 All years in the movie, please 10d movie. All right. See you then. Bye
