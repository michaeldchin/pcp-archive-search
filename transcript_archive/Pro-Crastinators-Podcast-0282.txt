00:00:00 Yes, I was drinking Alkma Hall. It was a Kazi's birthday yesterday.
00:00:06 Shame for having a birthday.
00:00:08 We all got fucked up. We all got twisted, if you know what I'm saying.
00:00:20 That wasn't very Jehovah's Witness of you, having a birthday.
00:00:24 That's true. Having a birthday is the... yeah, yeah.
00:00:29 I have a bunch of Jehovah's Witnesses in my family.
00:00:33 My mom's side is a bunch of fucking... a bunch of fucking kooks and weirdos and crystal healers and Jehovah's Witnesses and shit.
00:00:41 Oh, God.
00:00:42 I know. I mean, famously, one of them, like a couple years ago at Christmas, I was drinking a diet soda and one of them came up to me and was like, you know that's rat poison, right?
00:00:53 I was like, yes, thank you, yes.
00:00:58 It says it on the wall. That's my favorite.
00:01:04 You know it's rat poison, right? What are you talking about?
00:01:08 Fucking old kook. You old fucking bitch.
00:01:12 Leave me alone.
00:01:14 I bet she's not vaccinated. I bet she's dead.
00:01:23 Oh, God, I know. It's probably true.
00:01:25 It's probably true.
00:01:26 Almost definitely true. Almost definitely. Who knows what's in it?
00:01:29 Yeah, who knows?
00:01:30 Nobody knows.
00:01:32 My mom was on a bit of an anti-vax arc for a while, but I spoke to her yesterday and she was like giving a bunch of pro vaccine arguments.
00:01:42 And I was like, oh, good.
00:01:44 Hmm. Okay. Yeah, that's good.
00:01:46 That's growth. That's character growth.
00:01:50 Childhood is, I don't know, not getting vaccinated.
00:01:54 Adulthood is getting vaccinated.
00:01:56 I don't know. I don't fucking know, whatever.
00:02:01 That's correct.
00:02:02 I can't wait for a booster shot.
00:02:04 I can't wait for my booster shot.
00:02:07 I can't wait to get another microchip.
00:02:09 I know. I already got the funny microchip once.
00:02:13 Yeah, it needs friends. It's lonely in there. It needs friends.
00:02:19 I have a friend who's unironically into that.
00:02:23 He believes a microchip is from Satan himself.
00:02:27 Are you serious?
00:02:29 Yeah, he found a video of a guy that kind of looks like Bill Gates giving a conference on, here's how we can chemically remove religion from the brain.
00:02:39 And, quote unquote, religion is just like fanaticism.
00:02:43 Apparently, they're running experiments that could reduce people's ability to blow themselves up.
00:02:51 Like suicide bomb.
00:02:53 I mean, that sounds kind of good, actually.
00:02:57 If we could actually do that with the microchip, I would kind of appreciate the microchip.
00:03:03 No, actually, no, that's not true.
00:03:06 Terrorism is good, actually. I learned that from Final Fantasy VII.
00:03:10 Yeah, that is an important lesson.
00:03:14 And then his other point of contention was there's a chemical in the vaccine Satan microchip called Luciferis.
00:03:23 Lucifer, oh no.
00:03:26 Is that true? Is there a chemical called Luciferis?
00:03:29 That is a chemical.
00:03:31 Well, that changes everything.
00:03:33 It's called, it has Lucifer in the name because it emits light and Lucifer in Latin means like light or some shit.
00:03:41 What, no, hold on, what are you talking about? Words can only mean one thing.
00:03:47 Yeah, words can only mean Satan.
00:03:50 Every, all words.
00:03:52 All words mean, it's Satan or get out.
00:03:54 Ugh.
00:04:00 Did they already complain how hungover I am while we were recording? Did I already do that?
00:04:05 I don't remember if you did.
00:04:07 I feel so shitty. I feel like complete dog shit right now. Holy fuck, this is the worst. This is the absolute worst.
00:04:16 Man.
00:04:19 I had a back, I have a back problem right now. I've developed a back problem, a consistent back problem.
00:04:28 I mean, God, hopefully not.
00:04:33 Since lifting, so they started lifting again. I developed a pain in my back and it got really bad the other day and I went to the doctor.
00:04:40 I went to fucking urgent care. I was like, because I didn't have a, well, I had to call my insurance and be like, hey, give me a doctor.
00:04:47 I don't have a doctor. Can I have one? And they were like, yes. Yes, you can have one. Here you go. Let's sign you up.
00:04:54 They gave me a doctor and I was like, can I go see him? And they were like, you can see them in three weeks.
00:05:03 I'm in pain now though. And they were like, well, you can go to an urgent care and we'll probably cover that.
00:05:12 So I went to one. I had to wait for two, not that urgent because I had to wait for two hours in the waiting room.
00:05:20 And then they, and I was like, hey doc, my side hurts. I'm afraid it's my kidney and I'm afraid it's a kidney infection.
00:05:27 And they were like, well, pee in this cup and we'll tell you. And I did. And they were like, no, it's not a kidney thing.
00:05:32 And I was like, okay, well.
00:05:34 It's just, the culprit is keto once again.
00:05:36 I think it's just, I pulled something or I strained something. Yesterday, yesterday, yesterday it felt great.
00:05:43 I couldn't even feel it. I was like, I'm recovered. It's over. It's gone.
00:05:46 Today, it sucks. I can't sit. I can't even sit comfortably. And I'm gonna cry.
00:05:54 I entered my back horrifically in like May.
00:06:01 Also, before I tell the story, is this staying in or we didn't even do an intro or are we waiting for people to come on?
00:06:07 We didn't do an intro, but oh, yeah, we didn't do an intro. Hi everyone, patreon.com.
00:06:16 Oblivionfall.
00:06:17 Oblivionfall is our guest today.
00:06:22 Yeah, the guest is patreon.com slash oblivionfall. Hello.
00:06:26 True, true.
00:06:27 I'm doing the thing now.
00:06:28 Yeah.
00:06:29 I'm just stolen it from you, Ben.
00:06:31 Every draw cast, I plug myself.
00:06:35 Do you actually?
00:06:36 That's so cringe. That's so cringe.
00:06:39 I know. It's so good.
00:06:41 Yeah.
00:06:44 Yeah, no intro.
00:06:46 No normal intro. Fuck it. Nobody else showed up. It's just me and you.
00:06:51 Epic. That's fucking funny.
00:06:54 Yeah, sure.
00:06:55 So I have a terrible back. It all started in 2013. Some of my animator friends, including the one who is telling me about the Lucifer chemical.
00:07:10 This is before he went off the rails, which is sad because he is one of the people I've known the longest on the internet.
00:07:17 That's a bummer.
00:07:18 I'm actually going to move, so I'm going to lie down. I'm actually going to lie down on my...
00:07:23 I'm going to move my mattress and lie down.
00:07:25 What is this? The sleepy cast? What are you doing?
00:07:28 God, I wish. God, I fucking wish.
00:07:33 Okay. Let me know when you're laid down.
00:07:38 I'm getting laid down.
00:07:41 Oh, jeez. I'm not. That's great.
00:07:43 If you know what I'm saying.
00:07:46 Damn.
00:07:48 I'm having sexual intercourse if you know what I'm fucking saying.
00:07:54 Oh, God.
00:07:56 So one day...
00:07:57 I've done this before. I remember I've done this before and people complained that my mattress was creaky.
00:08:01 So I hope that happens again and everyone hates it.
00:08:04 Everyone hates your creaky mattress during sexual intercourse.
00:08:08 Right. All these hot bitches are like, I love your dick, but I hate how creaky your mattress is. I'm afraid it's over.
00:08:16 It's over and I go, I don't care.
00:08:20 Go on. Get out of here. Go home and be with your own kind.
00:08:24 The row rocks at them and they go, ah, they run away.
00:08:28 Damn.
00:08:30 Yeah. Sorry to keep interrupting. Go on.
00:08:32 That's all right. I'll resume.
00:08:34 Please, please.
00:08:36 Back in my pivot animation days, I met a lot of cool people.
00:08:40 I was meeting up with some of them in 2013 because a few of them lived in Australia and I was still in New Zealand at this point.
00:08:46 What we did is we went to my fucking high school and we just fucking took pictures of us goofing around.
00:08:53 No one was there. I think it was a weekend.
00:08:55 I'll throw a couple random pictures in chat of us just being goofy.
00:09:00 I'll fucking stand up and walk over to my computer.
00:09:04 Oh, you see, you see.
00:09:06 No.
00:09:08 And so we goofed around the high school and then one of the pictures, this third one here, I just put it up on Facebook.
00:09:15 I wasn't thinking anything and someone just said like, what the fuck is wrong if you're back?
00:09:20 I was like, what do you mean? And then I looked and clearly God had used the circle tool in Microsoft Paint to cut a hole in my back.
00:09:29 Because I don't know what else the fuck is happening there.
00:09:33 I was so confused.
00:09:35 It looks like you're doing it on purpose.
00:09:37 Apparently, but then I noticed that like, huh, I guess my back is kind of fucked up and then it kind of got more fucked up over time.
00:09:45 And I started having like really bad back pain and I realized, oh shit, I need to like sort this out.
00:09:52 So for a while, what I did is I got a bouncy ball chair.
00:09:57 Well, what do we call it? It's not called a bouncy ball chair.
00:09:59 It's like a chair that is like an exercise ball like on wheels.
00:10:03 Apparently that's supposed to help with your back or some shit, which it actually did.
00:10:09 I was also doing a lot of exercise with my, I had a personal trainer like a few years ago who was helping me out.
00:10:14 So that was pretty neat.
00:10:16 But then Jim is expensive and the balls kept deflating every time.
00:10:22 I went for like four of those chairs because I kept just fucking deflating on me.
00:10:25 So I gave up and now my back's been in decline again.
00:10:29 And it's really bad.
00:10:30 So in May, I'm across the room, by the way, I went up to the wall and I d-dag zaggles on Twitter recommended that I get a tennis ball.
00:10:43 And I get a tennis ball and I like, and I like use it as a massage tool and I like, like, like something like back against the wall and I roll it around.
00:10:51 I'm doing that right now.
00:10:53 I've been told that too.
00:10:55 And I didn't do it.
00:10:57 It sometimes sort of helps a bit.
00:11:01 Sometimes I feel a little better after I do it.
00:11:04 A chiropractor told me to do that.
00:11:07 And being a chiropractor, I did the opposite.
00:11:09 Chiropractors aren't even real.
00:11:10 Exactly.
00:11:11 They're not even real scientists.
00:11:12 Yeah, they're not.
00:11:13 They don't watch freaking Morty.
00:11:15 It's a soft science like economics.
00:11:17 It's not real.
00:11:19 Yeah.
00:11:21 It's all made up.
00:11:23 They're just massage boys.
00:11:26 I mean, at the end of the day, it's true.
00:11:30 Well, in May, or I think maybe late April, I don't fucking remember exactly when it was.
00:11:36 I'd spent like a week with my feet on the desk.
00:11:39 I was like slouching on my chair, like at the Olympic level, dude.
00:11:44 And it was bad because it started really fucking on my back.
00:11:48 I'm like, you know, I should do those stretches that my personal trainer taught me.
00:11:51 I haven't done those in like a year.
00:11:52 What could happen?
00:11:53 And so one morning I was up like super early or something.
00:11:58 I was going to call off my friend and I just started doing one of the stretches.
00:12:01 And I did the hip bridge and something fucked up.
00:12:04 Like it wasn't like there was no, there wasn't like a click or there wasn't like a singular
00:12:08 moment where something fucked in my back.
00:12:10 But like I was doing it for like 10 seconds and I was like, oh, oh, this hurts.
00:12:14 This hurts more than it should.
00:12:16 And then I, you know, collapsed down and then I realized I couldn't move.
00:12:20 I was stuck on my back and I couldn't actually, I couldn't roll over.
00:12:23 I couldn't move.
00:12:24 I was in extreme pain.
00:12:25 Wait, you did that?
00:12:27 And you did that by doing the stretches that like the doctor recommended to you?
00:12:32 That my personal trainer did.
00:12:33 Well, yeah, the stretches are designed to help.
00:12:35 Yeah, they designed to help my back and they were really helpful back then.
00:12:39 But I guess I'd been out of it for so long that I wasn't ready for it or some shit.
00:12:45 And I couldn't move for like 15 minutes.
00:12:48 I was on the floor and I was, and my friend was just on discord because I had my headset on.
00:12:52 I was like trying to like, took me ages to like be able to get back up and talk to him.
00:12:56 And he was just like, oh, fucking jeez.
00:12:59 And it didn't get any better throughout the day.
00:13:03 And I couldn't even like, like sitting was the most painful thing.
00:13:08 I could keep my, keep my back straight was fine.
00:13:10 Standing up was fine.
00:13:11 Laying down was fine.
00:13:12 Anything else hurt so bad.
00:13:14 Like request, request.
00:13:16 Why can I speak?
00:13:18 What the fuck?
00:13:19 I had to get request.
00:13:22 I had to get.
00:13:26 I had to get two weeks off work where pretty much for a whole time I couldn't sit in a chair.
00:13:32 I had to like mainly lay like, I forget how it was.
00:13:36 There's like a specific position that was like really helpful, like laying on my side or something.
00:13:43 And oh yeah, I had to lay on my side with a fucking body pillow like between my knees.
00:13:47 It was like the ideal thing to recover because I don't have fucking health insurance.
00:13:50 So I googled like what to do and you injure your back and they're like, yeah, doctors just going to charge you money and just tell you to do this.
00:13:56 So just do it.
00:13:57 I'm like, okay.
00:13:58 So I did that and it worked and I've been worked on my back since then, but that was fucking.
00:14:04 That was a fucking time.
00:14:06 That sounds pretty fucking.
00:14:09 I was really scared I would become Tom.
00:14:12 Yeah, that's what we're all trying to avoid.
00:14:16 Next thing you know, you're writing for SaverSpark and then it's all over.
00:14:22 It's all fucking over for you.
00:14:30 Yeah, I was a bit, I was a little disappointed actually because on the one hand it would be bad to have a kidney infection.
00:14:37 But on the other hand, if I had gone and that she had told me like, yes, you have a kidney infection here or some antibiotics to take, it will go away.
00:14:45 I'd be like, cool.
00:14:46 And then I would do it and then the issue would go away.
00:14:49 But now she's just like, no, it's not a kidney infection.
00:14:52 It's just nothing.
00:14:54 It's just whatever.
00:14:56 It's nothing.
00:14:57 You just got to fucking deal with it.
00:14:59 And I'm like, oh, okay.
00:15:01 I love it when it's nothing.
00:15:03 Yeah, it's no the problem we're having.
00:15:05 It's nothing.
00:15:06 Just deal with it, loser.
00:15:08 My will, I suppose.
00:15:11 You know, back when there was health insurance in this household, I guess it was before we moved into this apartment.
00:15:16 Good times, good times.
00:15:18 Well, my partner used to have health insurance a few years ago and they were going through some kind of medical like catastrophe where they were basically throwing up like everything they ate for like a month.
00:15:32 Like even water, they would throw, they would vomit, food vomit.
00:15:37 Like one out of every 10 meals would stay down.
00:15:40 They were blacking out constantly.
00:15:43 They were losing weight.
00:15:44 They were in pain.
00:15:46 It was awful.
00:15:47 And multiple times we went to the emergency room and they would just, they're just like, sure, here's some fucking saline, I guess.
00:15:55 Yeah, nothing's wrong.
00:15:57 Go home.
00:16:00 Nothing's wrong, go home.
00:16:02 Also, give us 500 bucks.
00:16:04 Nothing's right, I'm torn.
00:16:07 And that happened multiple times and they just were fucking around being assholes.
00:16:13 And then eventually, they were like, oh, like five months later, they were like, oh, I guess we got to take your gallbladder out.
00:16:22 And it was like, oh cool, you couldn't have figured that out five months ago.
00:16:26 Yeah.
00:16:27 They just didn't even want to check.
00:16:33 Man, loving that health insurance is really worth the money.
00:16:37 Jesus.
00:16:39 Didn't Mage have her gallbladder out at some point?
00:16:43 Oh yeah.
00:16:44 Didn't she say that she had to go, it wasn't just like they did an operation and they took her gallbladder out.
00:16:49 She said she spent several months in Russia or something, or the Ukraine or something, in some sort of health camp, whatever that means.
00:17:01 Wait, I vaguely remember that, yeah.
00:17:03 It was like she did eventually just have surgery and have her gallbladder out.
00:17:07 But before that, yeah, she spent like, she went away to some health camp where they did alternative medicine shit of kinds I can only imagine.
00:17:26 This is just like, oh geez, Lois, this is just like that time in Golden Girls.
00:17:35 This is the reference I always go to when doctors are bad.
00:17:40 This is just like the time in Golden Girls when Dorothy has mysterious fatigue and doesn't know why and she keeps going to different doctors and they all go,
00:17:52 eh, have you considered that you're just like a stupid woman and you don't know what you're talking about?
00:17:56 And she's like, yes, doctor, I have considered that, but I still don't know what's wrong.
00:18:00 And they're like, well, I think we've cracked the case.
00:18:04 Get out of my office.
00:18:09 Oh yeah.
00:18:10 There was a bit of that, though, even from female doctors and nurses and shit.
00:18:19 They'd ask you about, you go in there because you got this pain and you're throwing up constantly.
00:18:26 And they're like, how's your sex life?
00:18:29 And my partner's like, I'm asexual.
00:18:31 I don't really, I don't do sex.
00:18:35 That's a phase.
00:18:36 You'll get over it, says the nurse.
00:18:37 Wait, that's totally irrelevant.
00:18:39 That's totally irrelevant to why I'm here to say that.
00:18:41 You'll want to have kids.
00:18:42 You better fucking breed, she said.
00:18:43 You gotta be fucking joking me.
00:18:46 Really?
00:18:47 They would just take the opportunity.
00:18:51 Let me take this opportunity to tell you, you should be having more sex and more babies.
00:18:58 Okay, cool.
00:19:00 It's pretty weird.
00:19:05 Well, the doctor didn't tell me that.
00:19:09 Well, that's because you're not a woman, Ben.
00:19:12 Yeah, it's true.
00:19:16 Yes, so who cares what I do?
00:19:20 So who cares?
00:19:23 Shit, I just remembered I left a portion of a Chipotle burrito down the street in Kazi's house.
00:19:32 Okay.
00:19:33 What do I gotta do?
00:19:35 Hold on, hold on, give me 10 minutes.
00:19:37 Give me a 10 minute hiatus as I walk down the street.
00:19:40 What do you say down the street?
00:19:42 I think you meant on a mailbox somewhere.
00:19:44 Yeah, it's a street burrito.
00:19:47 Street tacos.
00:19:49 That's what we in the biz call a street taco.
00:19:51 I've had some of those.
00:19:53 Can I switch to my phone?
00:19:56 Maybe you can switch to my phone and just record through Craig.
00:19:59 I walk over there, grab my burrito.
00:20:01 Eleazar is going to love you.
00:20:03 And walk back eating it.
00:20:04 Fuck Eleazar.
00:20:06 No, it's not true.
00:20:08 I'm sorry Eleazar, I love you.
00:20:09 I don't care that you're cheating on us with the gamer zone, it's fine.
00:20:16 It's okay.
00:20:18 Our draw cast editor is cheating on us with Nate and someone else.
00:20:24 Oh, is it no need?
00:20:26 It is no need, yeah.
00:20:27 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:20:28 What a slut.
00:20:30 I know, right?
00:20:31 What a fucking slut.
00:20:32 Oh, I think C.T.A.L. at everyone about a game of draw telephone for the draw cast.
00:20:42 And I didn't look, I was like, I'll look later and I think I may have missed it.
00:20:49 You can still get in.
00:20:51 I kind of wanted to.
00:20:54 We're not even halfway through the list.
00:20:57 We can just add people to the list and move them around who haven't done it yet.
00:21:00 So, you can easily still get in.
00:21:03 Well, maybe I should do that then.
00:21:08 Yeah, Teleperte is involved in that.
00:21:11 I know, I know.
00:21:13 I want to get in.
00:21:15 I want to be, I want to time it so I'm next to that guy.
00:21:20 That can be arranged.
00:21:22 I want to sneakily.
00:21:25 I can find a way to sneak you on to an episode of the draw cast with Teleperte if it means
00:21:32 that much to you.
00:21:33 No way.
00:21:34 You could actually get me on the draw cast.
00:21:37 In that no way.
00:21:39 I mean, you are a very, very unknown small artist, but it could happen.
00:21:45 That's true.
00:21:46 It's sad, but true.
00:21:48 Yeah, I think, yeah, yeah, I thought it was pretty neat.
00:21:52 I thought it was pretty neat that I was invited into that server.
00:21:56 I would be on a draw cast sometime.
00:22:00 I think Gib was talking about that she was on a draw cast.
00:22:05 Yeah, she was on the animation episode where we did an animation in 45 minutes, which was fucking crazy.
00:22:11 Which is, I mean, it's a bit of a cheat.
00:22:15 I mean, that's not even fair.
00:22:17 That's what Teleperte does is makes quick animations.
00:22:21 I know.
00:22:23 That's like his whole thing.
00:22:24 Is Teleperte a guy?
00:22:25 I think he's a guy, right?
00:22:26 He's a guy, yeah.
00:22:28 He destroyed us, but it was pretty cool.
00:22:31 Of course.
00:22:32 The deck was stacked.
00:22:34 Honestly, all of us did pretty fucking well.
00:22:36 Even C.T.O.L. who had never animated before did a pretty cool animation for that.
00:22:41 I mean, the theme was animating an amogus, killing itself.
00:22:45 Which, of course, they've got a very simple character design.
00:22:49 It's easy to draw.
00:22:50 We did a stick figure fighting one a bit later.
00:22:54 That should come out in a few weeks.
00:22:56 Teleperte was also on.
00:22:59 Oh, like a Zhao Zhao?
00:23:03 Yeah, Xio, Xio, whatever you call it, Zhao Zhao.
00:23:08 I don't know if I'm saying it right.
00:23:10 I mean, I was in the stick figure community for years.
00:23:14 I was deep in that shit.
00:23:16 Oh, really?
00:23:17 Yeah.
00:23:18 Did you make any?
00:23:19 Oh, yeah.
00:23:20 I was legendary in my community.
00:23:23 You were legend?
00:23:24 Really?
00:23:25 Yeah, I think I mentioned before.
00:23:26 I didn't know this.
00:23:27 I got my start as a pivot animator, which is like...
00:23:30 Pivot is like this stick figure program that you...
00:23:34 If you've seen it, you probably saw some kids using it at school.
00:23:37 That's typically how...
00:23:39 People I know who've heard of it say they've seen it before.
00:23:42 It was specifically a stick figure animation program.
00:23:45 Yeah.
00:23:46 The way it works is really cool, actually.
00:23:49 Let me see if I can get a picture of it.
00:23:51 So it's kind of hard to explain without a visual aid.
00:23:55 Here we go.
00:23:56 This image should work.
00:23:57 Sorry about my creaky mattress.
00:24:00 I can't hear the creaky mattress.
00:24:02 But Pivot basically looks like this.
00:24:04 You have a stick figure and he has these little red joints.
00:24:08 You just click on them with the mouse and move them around.
00:24:10 Then you hit the next frame button and it saves the pose.
00:24:14 You can just position him.
00:24:16 There's no drawing required.
00:24:18 You can create custom figures and shit.
00:24:20 It's very simple.
00:24:22 It has less features than Microsoft Paint.
00:24:25 But it's really good for learning the basics.
00:24:28 There's no shortcuts.
00:24:29 There's no tweens.
00:24:30 There's no nothing like that.
00:24:32 Teleparter got his start doing that.
00:24:34 So did a lot of people I know.
00:24:37 It was cool.
00:24:39 Do you know what that is cool?
00:24:41 Most of the people I got on were people from the Hyun's Dojo server,
00:24:46 which is all about stick figure fighting.
00:24:48 Hyun's Dojo?
00:24:50 Yeah.
00:24:51 It's a discord server for stick figure animators
00:24:55 who are, I guess, fans or associated with an animator called Hyun,
00:25:00 who did some shit for League of Legends.
00:25:04 Bass.
00:25:05 I was a fan of that guy since 2009, even before League was a thing.
00:25:11 But yeah, basically we got a bunch of cool stick figure people on
00:25:14 to animate a stick fight for a draw cast.
00:25:17 And that was also cool.
00:25:21 And it's not even out yet.
00:25:23 But it will be soon, maybe.
00:25:27 Fucking neat.
00:25:28 Fucking neat as hell.
00:25:32 I haven't watched one yet.
00:25:36 I haven't watched a draw cast yet.
00:25:38 But I've seen the episodes you've been putting out.
00:25:42 I saw you guys got, did we talk about already,
00:25:44 that you guys got YouTube destroyed, but then they fixed it?
00:25:48 Oh yeah.
00:25:50 Your channel was Nukes or something, right?
00:25:52 Yeah, YouTube Nukes.
00:25:53 By accident?
00:25:54 Yeah.
00:25:55 You have a Nukes for spam and deception, like severe deception.
00:25:59 What does that mean?
00:26:01 Well, I had to look into it because I'm like spam.
00:26:04 Is it because we're uploading quickly?
00:26:05 No, YouTube wants us to upload quickly.
00:26:07 They want everyone to upload quickly.
00:26:08 If I can't fucking be the reason.
00:26:10 I had to look up YouTube's policy for deceptive practices
00:26:15 and spam and shit.
00:26:16 It turns out the bar you have to cross
00:26:21 is the lowest fucking bar in the world.
00:26:23 You know these YouTube channels that will upload?
00:26:26 Hello guys, it's BlackPant for 2017 4K.
00:26:31 Watch on YouTube for free.
00:26:32 Oh yeah.
00:26:33 I hate that guy.
00:26:34 And the video is just a fucking JPEG for an hour
00:26:36 and there's a virus in the video description.
00:26:38 It's basically that.
00:26:39 Wait, what?
00:26:41 Apparently that is what YouTube thought we were.
00:26:44 I actually don't know the thing you're describing.
00:26:48 Oh my god.
00:26:49 The video is, I've seen YouTube videos that are like,
00:26:54 if you're looking for a movie,
00:26:56 it will say that it's the movie
00:26:58 and then it will just be a still image
00:27:00 that's like look in the description
00:27:02 and the description is a link to a downloader site
00:27:07 that will give you a virus.
00:27:08 Yeah, that's basically what I'm talking about
00:27:11 is that kind of shit.
00:27:12 So that's what YouTube is like.
00:27:14 There's spam policy and deception policy
00:27:17 is mainly to stop people from doing that shit.
00:27:20 Or just like posting nefarious links in general
00:27:24 or trying to trick people into clicking on shit
00:27:27 that is fake to that degree.
00:27:31 So I was like, yeah, I'm pretty sure we didn't do that.
00:27:34 I'm pretty sure, yeah, I don't think so.
00:27:36 And we followed an appeal
00:27:38 and we heard fucking nothing for almost a week.
00:27:41 And then we just made a Twitter post
00:27:43 which nothing really happened.
00:27:45 Vintela Perte retweeted it
00:27:46 and it got solved within a couple hours.
00:27:49 Yeah, that's how it goes.
00:27:51 That's how it works.
00:27:52 That isn't that the way they say it goes.
00:27:56 Sad but true.
00:27:58 If only you'd had big famous friends
00:28:01 to save the PCP when it was under fire.
00:28:04 If only.
00:28:06 If only.
00:28:09 Well, we had a couple,
00:28:11 but maybe not Teleperte-sized.
00:28:13 So it did eventually get fixed.
00:28:15 It's not that fast.
00:28:18 Yeah, just a few months, you know.
00:28:21 Although, yeah.
00:28:23 I saw, is YMS still having the thing
00:28:27 with like his side channel got demonetized or something?
00:28:30 And for a while there, he kept tweeting about it
00:28:33 and it seemed like they weren't doing anything.
00:28:35 Oh yeah, didn't his game channel got nuked for terrorism?
00:28:40 Yeah, because, was it like a 9-11 joke or something?
00:28:44 Yeah, there was a 9-11 joke.
00:28:47 It was really messed up.
00:28:50 Hmm.
00:28:52 Did they fix it?
00:28:54 I don't know if they fixed it.
00:28:56 When a channel like YMS complains about something,
00:28:58 they always get what they want, because they're big.
00:29:01 You would think they would be like,
00:29:03 oh, sorry, sir, right away, sir.
00:29:05 I haven't seen a post about it in a while.
00:29:07 I mean, I could just look up that in plays
00:29:09 and see if it's there.
00:29:12 See if it exists, come on YouTube.
00:29:14 Well, it was always there.
00:29:16 It was demonetized, though, was the problem, right?
00:29:19 Was it? Hold on.
00:29:22 I'm trying to read the post,
00:29:24 because I found the post on Twitter from Adam.
00:29:28 This is him talking about YouTube claiming
00:29:30 that he supports violent criminal organizations.
00:29:33 Hell yeah.
00:29:37 Just lean into it.
00:29:41 Oh, yeah, okay, I see what happened.
00:29:44 He got a guideline strike, so it wasn't free strikes
00:29:47 and he's out, he just got a strike that was stupid.
00:29:50 Yeah, I don't know if I'd ever got resolved.
00:29:53 I see multiple tweets of back and forth between YouTube
00:29:56 where he's like, hey, YouTube, I'm not a terrorist,
00:29:58 and YouTube's been like, hi, after reviewing,
00:30:00 you are a terrorist.
00:30:03 Which is like, thanks.
00:30:06 You gotta be like...
00:30:09 Huh, what?
00:30:11 Oh, sorry, you go.
00:30:13 I'm gonna say you gotta be like, well, if YouTube
00:30:15 tells them, thinks I'm a terrorist,
00:30:17 then maybe I really will be a terrorist.
00:30:19 Maybe I'll show them what a terrorist I can be.
00:30:22 I'll show them how many funny 9-11 jokes
00:30:25 I can make and tell my audience that blowing up things
00:30:28 is cool, actually.
00:30:30 We'll see. We'll show them.
00:30:35 Okay, now you go.
00:30:38 I mean, you did say that terrorism was cool
00:30:40 at the beginning of this podcast.
00:30:42 I mean, I am a traitor of America.
00:30:45 You are.
00:30:47 Thanks, C-Tol.
00:30:49 Thanks, C-Tol, for getting me on the Traitors of America list.
00:30:52 That list probably doesn't exist anymore, huh?
00:30:55 That's a shame. I hope it still exists.
00:30:58 Maybe that guy, I think that guy deleted his Twitter account.
00:31:01 What's his name? Irate Gamer?
00:31:04 Wait, is it Irate Gamer or someone?
00:31:07 Pretty sure it's someone else.
00:31:09 Maybe...
00:31:11 Well, he had a name like that, though.
00:31:13 It was like One Angry Gamer or something.
00:31:15 Oh, yeah, One Angry Gamer sounds right.
00:31:17 I think Irate Gamer was like some ancient,
00:31:20 like, angry video game nerd knockoff.
00:31:23 Yeah, yeah, I think you're right.
00:31:26 So, sorry Irate Gamer if you're listening to this.
00:31:28 I didn't mean to impugn your character
00:31:31 by implying that it was One Angry Gamer.
00:31:35 Much completely different.
00:31:38 Irate Gamer's character has been impugned enough already.
00:31:41 Let's be fair.
00:31:42 That's true, that's true.
00:31:45 Is he the one that basically just completely stole
00:31:49 Angry Video Game Nerd's shtick?
00:31:51 I'm pretty sure.
00:31:53 God, I first heard of him
00:31:56 when I found my first Doug Walker video, I think.
00:31:59 There was a video I found on YouTube
00:32:02 fucking years ago of like...
00:32:04 It was called like the longest insult ever
00:32:06 and it was the nostalgia critic, like
00:32:08 calling someone a dirty, fucked up,
00:32:10 sadistic piece of shit for like two minutes.
00:32:12 Just a big string of ad-homs.
00:32:16 It was great and I was like,
00:32:18 wow, this is funny, who's the Irate Gamer?
00:32:20 And I had no idea.
00:32:22 Wait, why did you think...
00:32:24 Was he insulting the Irate Gamer?
00:32:26 I think so.
00:32:28 That's sort of what it was related to in some way.
00:32:31 Why was he insulting the Irate Gamer?
00:32:33 What did he do?
00:32:35 Why would he do this?
00:32:37 Hold on, I mean, I guess I could look it up.
00:32:40 Why would you so viciously attack one of...
00:32:42 Literally, one of your co-workers,
00:32:44 one of your contemporaries,
00:32:46 one of your peers?
00:32:48 Why would you attack them like this, Doug?
00:32:54 I don't know.
00:32:55 I mean, according to this,
00:32:58 that's just what the title says.
00:33:01 And unless the insult was from something else
00:33:04 and there was some Irate Gamer drama
00:33:06 and everyone was just putting this video at him saying,
00:33:09 hey, this is you, which I don't know.
00:33:12 Hey, this is you.
00:33:16 Hey, I bet Doug's talking about you right now
00:33:18 and he's like, I don't know about Doug.
00:33:20 Everyone was like, oh my god, Doug Walker
00:33:22 and talked for two minutes
00:33:24 about what a piece of shit someone is.
00:33:26 This makes me think of the Irate Gamer.
00:33:28 I gotta tell the Irate Gamer, okay, this is you.
00:33:31 Oh my god, there he is, it's young Doug.
00:33:34 It's young Doug in a more innocent...
00:33:37 A more innocent time.
00:33:39 You know, back when the wall was slightly beige.
00:33:44 Back before...
00:33:46 Oh, the wall behind him, not the wall review.
00:33:49 Oh god, no, not the wall review.
00:33:51 I've seen...
00:33:53 I've watched so many videos about the wall review.
00:33:57 I've...
00:33:59 The wall review is great.
00:34:01 It's actually a great video because it's inspired so many,
00:34:05 highly entertaining takedowns
00:34:09 and think pieces about why is this what it is,
00:34:13 why does this exist, why is this so terrible.
00:34:16 Why is Corey Taylor from Slipknot involved?
00:34:19 That's my big question.
00:34:21 There's so many things about it
00:34:24 that are like, why would you do this?
00:34:27 Why is this the form this project took?
00:34:31 Yeah, fucking Fena.
00:34:33 I knew about Fena already because one of my furry friends
00:34:36 was like introvert stuff
00:34:38 and I always thought it was creepy and weird
00:34:40 the way they move around.
00:34:42 Is Fena a girl?
00:34:44 I don't know if Fena's like the creator is a girl or boy.
00:34:48 I think the character might be a girl.
00:34:50 Maybe.
00:34:53 Is one of the characters named Fena?
00:34:56 Actually, maybe not.
00:34:58 I think Fena is the artist and the...
00:35:01 God, I don't know.
00:35:03 I'm just thinking of the creepy rat thing
00:35:05 with the sharp teeth and the rat thing on the side.
00:35:07 No, that thing's not named Fena.
00:35:09 That has a different name.
00:35:11 Lucy Lace Maker?
00:35:14 That sounds correct, actually.
00:35:16 I just thought all the characters were named Fena.
00:35:20 Maybe that's my mistake.
00:35:23 Every character is named Fena.
00:35:27 It was after I watched a Folding Ideas video
00:35:30 about the wall.
00:35:32 That was a pretty good video.
00:35:34 I love that video.
00:35:36 It's so good.
00:35:38 But he talks a little bit about Fena
00:35:41 and he sort of explained...
00:35:44 He says that it's bad, but it still made me curious.
00:35:48 I was like...
00:35:50 It's like a multi-media...
00:35:52 It's like an expansive universe.
00:35:54 It mixes animation and real-life actors.
00:35:58 That's kind of odd.
00:36:00 That's sort of unique, I guess.
00:36:02 I'll go and look at some.
00:36:04 I went and navigated over the channel
00:36:06 and I looked at it and it really is...
00:36:09 It is an interesting idea.
00:36:12 It's an interesting way of making a cartoon.
00:36:16 But it's...
00:36:18 It's like someone tried to interpret Vivzi Pop's style
00:36:21 into Uncanny 3D.
00:36:23 Uncanny 3D?
00:36:25 Like...
00:36:27 It's like...
00:36:29 It's like watching a high school or home movies
00:36:32 with just ad-libbed the dialogue.
00:36:35 When the actors are talking it all feels ad-libbed
00:36:38 and aimless.
00:36:41 I watched one that was like...
00:36:44 It was like a guy brings another guy to a field
00:36:47 and he's like...
00:36:49 Yeah, we own you now. You're my slave now.
00:36:52 We're gonna make you work in these fields
00:36:55 and do farm work for me because I own you.
00:36:59 Him and Lucy just like...
00:37:02 I don't know, they just ramble about it.
00:37:04 The guy goes...
00:37:06 I'm in a predicament and Lucy goes...
00:37:08 It's what you deserve, mate.
00:37:12 This is payback for what you've done.
00:37:16 What have you done, lad?
00:37:18 Why have you brought me to this field, son?
00:37:20 Why did you bring me to this field?
00:37:22 Because it's cheap to film in an outdoor location
00:37:25 as in the public field.
00:37:29 The crowd will never be yours.
00:37:32 Okay.
00:37:34 What do we have to work with for our video?
00:37:37 We have a camera
00:37:39 and we have a bunch of outdoor places that we could go.
00:37:43 Okay, so what story can we tell
00:37:46 in which it only involves our characters
00:37:49 like walking into a field,
00:37:51 talking to each other for a minute,
00:37:53 and then the video ends?
00:37:55 Okay, indentured servitude. Got it.
00:37:57 Okay, that's easy.
00:37:59 I guess when it comes to videos in fields,
00:38:02 Favre in the field is the best video of all time.
00:38:05 Favre in the field.
00:38:07 This is my favorite fucking video on YouTube, probably.
00:38:10 I save it about 10 different videos,
00:38:12 but this is one of the 10.
00:38:15 This is what FedEx should have spent their time doing.
00:38:19 Just animating JPEGs moving around
00:38:21 rather than really complicated 3D models.
00:38:26 The thing about FedEx is it is impressive
00:38:32 how much we're able to do,
00:38:34 but more movement does not equal better animation.
00:38:38 The characters are just constantly
00:38:40 moving up and down.
00:38:42 They're constantly wiggling.
00:38:44 It's weird.
00:38:46 It's not good character animation.
00:38:49 It's smooth, but that doesn't equal good animation.
00:38:53 They have some sort of tool set
00:38:57 that enables them to make the character
00:39:00 just constantly be wiggling around at all times
00:39:03 and be good for them.
00:39:05 Yeah, but it's very...
00:39:08 It looks like they're...
00:39:10 I don't know.
00:39:12 It looks like they're floating in liquid or something
00:39:15 and their fur is sort of anti-gravity.
00:39:19 It's all just kind of moving around.
00:39:22 The dialogue is the same.
00:39:24 They're constantly muttering something.
00:39:27 They're constantly mumbling
00:39:29 or just saying some off-topic stuff.
00:39:32 There can be no silence.
00:39:34 There has to be some...
00:39:36 They must overload your brain at all times.
00:39:40 Yeah, it's the same philosophy with the movement
00:39:42 as with the dialogue.
00:39:44 It's just constantly moving.
00:39:46 It doesn't matter if it's going anywhere,
00:39:48 but it's all moving.
00:39:50 Yeah, accurate.
00:39:52 What is this father in the field?
00:39:54 It's like Monty Python.
00:39:56 Oh, I skipped ahead a little bit.
00:39:58 Someone's getting stabbed.
00:40:01 Someone, definitely.
00:40:04 This is okay.
00:40:06 It seems good.
00:40:08 This seems like something Gib would like.
00:40:10 Yeah, probably.
00:40:12 This guy was like a video game review channel
00:40:15 or something, and then he just
00:40:17 didn't make a review in a long time
00:40:19 and then just made this.
00:40:21 And I'm like, yeah, you've peaked.
00:40:23 You can't peep.
00:40:25 Father in the field.
00:40:28 I feel like I wish I had...
00:40:31 If I could freeze time,
00:40:33 I would freeze time,
00:40:35 watch the whole thing, and come back.
00:40:37 But we're on a tight schedule.
00:40:39 We're on a tight schedule here.
00:40:41 We got to be in Cincinnati by sundown,
00:40:44 as Big Joel once said,
00:40:47 for no particular reason.
00:40:49 Joel's not that big.
00:40:51 He's not even named Joel.
00:40:54 What the fuck?
00:40:56 That's illegal.
00:40:58 You can't false advertise like that.
00:41:00 But it's not.
00:41:07 Okay.
00:41:09 My back feels a little better
00:41:11 from lying down.
00:41:13 Sorry about my creaky mattress.
00:41:15 Sorry if my throat sounds like
00:41:17 because I'm laying on my neck.
00:41:19 I have the mattress pressing.
00:41:21 It feels great, though.
00:41:23 Shut up, phone!
00:41:26 Telling me that it's 11.05 in the morning.
00:41:28 I don't want to know that.
00:41:33 Well...
00:41:35 I had my phone delivered to me by my husband.
00:41:37 I had to leave it with him
00:41:39 so it could wake him up
00:41:41 after I started recording this podcast.
00:41:46 And he delivered it to you?
00:41:48 I guess he delivered it to me.
00:41:50 He came out here a few minutes ago
00:41:52 and just put the phone on my desk and then left.
00:41:55 Why doesn't he get his own damn phone?
00:41:57 I don't know.
00:41:59 I don't know.
00:42:01 They'll wake me up at 9.30.
00:42:03 You know why I feel so bad this morning.
00:42:06 You know why I'm cranky.
00:42:08 It's because I didn't have my damn rain sounds.
00:42:11 I forgot to put my damn rain sounds on
00:42:14 for sleeping.
00:42:16 I forgot to put my favorite YouTube channel,
00:42:19 Dreamy Sound.
00:42:21 And I didn't have it.
00:42:24 So I'm not rested.
00:42:26 Dreamy Sound.
00:42:28 I love Dreamy Sound.
00:42:30 You know Minecraft, you tube a dream.
00:42:32 That's where he puts his music from.
00:42:34 Dreamy Sound?
00:42:36 The thing about Dreamy Sound,
00:42:38 this is a bit interesting.
00:42:40 There's actually a little bit interesting.
00:42:42 There are channels where they'll just post
00:42:44 10 hours of recording of rain or something.
00:42:47 Dreamy Sounds does not merely post
00:42:49 long sounds.
00:42:51 He posts that.
00:42:53 But for each sound,
00:42:55 he creates like a
00:42:57 fantasy landscape
00:42:59 to go with it.
00:43:01 He will make like...
00:43:03 Oh yeah, this is the sound of the ocean.
00:43:05 But in the video,
00:43:07 I will put together a little image that's like
00:43:09 a bed floating on like a platform
00:43:11 in the middle of like a
00:43:13 vast like placid ocean.
00:43:15 You can see all the way to the horizon.
00:43:17 Or like...
00:43:19 Placid, Placid.
00:43:21 Placid, okay.
00:43:23 Or he'll be like...
00:43:25 Or he'll composite an image of
00:43:27 like, oh, this is like my dream apartment.
00:43:29 And it's like, you know, it's got
00:43:31 like mood lighting and it's got, you know,
00:43:33 it's like a nice little cozy living room.
00:43:35 And there's like a big window
00:43:37 that looking out on like a city from
00:43:39 like a high rise building.
00:43:41 Or, you know, whatever.
00:43:43 He'll put together these little scenes.
00:43:45 It's like, this is the scene
00:43:47 where in the dreamy sound is occurring.
00:43:51 Oh, these are like...
00:43:53 These are like cool 3D renders.
00:43:55 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:43:57 That's cool. It is cool.
00:43:59 I mean, I honestly don't care.
00:44:01 I don't really care about the visual.
00:44:03 I only care about the sound.
00:44:05 But he goes above and beyond and he makes
00:44:07 these little like...
00:44:09 These little scenarios for them.
00:44:11 That's kind of neat.
00:44:13 Wait, hold on. This is cozy rain.
00:44:15 I clicked on a video called dreamy sound
00:44:17 and then the next video
00:44:19 that I thought was the same channel
00:44:21 was actually a channel called cozy rain
00:44:23 doing the exact same thing.
00:44:25 That's just like when I'm watching
00:44:27 my favorite cooking YouTuber,
00:44:29 chocolate cacao.
00:44:31 And then I click on the next video
00:44:33 and I think it's another chocolate cacao video.
00:44:35 But no, it's some other freak.
00:44:37 It's some other freak stealing his bit
00:44:39 of making food that looks good.
00:44:41 And I can't fucking get off to that.
00:44:43 I can't get off to someone else
00:44:45 making a damn jelly tart
00:44:47 because they don't sprinkle the chocolate on it
00:44:49 at the end and they don't do the little
00:44:51 yada, like triumph pose at the end.
00:44:53 And what's even the fucking point
00:44:55 if you don't do the little yada triumph pose
00:44:57 at the end?
00:44:59 Honestly.
00:45:01 Why even live?
00:45:03 That's why I eat food so I can pose afterwards.
00:45:05 He does a little
00:45:07 he doesn't say yada
00:45:09 but he does a little like
00:45:11 fist pump thing.
00:45:13 Is he like
00:45:15 is he like a
00:45:17 Japaneseman?
00:45:19 I think so.
00:45:21 I think so, yeah.
00:45:23 He doesn't show his face.
00:45:25 You only ever see his face
00:45:27 in like dark, in like
00:45:29 shadowed silhouettes. Just for like one shot.
00:45:31 Just for one shot at the end of the video
00:45:33 you'll see his hands and you'll see his body
00:45:35 he's wearing an apron.
00:45:37 And then at the end they'll have a
00:45:39 other recipe and he'll put it on the table
00:45:41 and then you'll have one little shadowed
00:45:43 shot from the side where you see his face
00:45:45 only in silhouette and then he does
00:45:47 a little triumph and pose and then he
00:45:49 brings up a pinch of cocoa powder
00:45:51 and he starts to sprinkle it and then you see
00:45:53 the cocoa sprinkling onto whatever
00:45:55 it is he just made.
00:45:57 And that's all you get to see
00:45:59 of chocolate cacao.
00:46:01 That's cool, Gladdy.
00:46:03 It's so cool.
00:46:05 Mystery is fun.
00:46:07 He's not entirely faceless.
00:46:09 He's mostly faceless
00:46:11 but he gives you just a little bit.
00:46:13 Damn.
00:46:15 I mean, his
00:46:17 tarts are
00:46:19 works of art.
00:46:21 They're not even food.
00:46:23 They're masterpiece sculptures.
00:46:25 The only cooking YouTuber I've watched
00:46:27 is, I don't remember her name.
00:46:29 She's like an Australian
00:46:31 woman
00:46:33 who looks like my mom
00:46:35 kind of
00:46:37 and
00:46:39 Does she talk or is she silent?
00:46:41 She used to
00:46:43 just do regular cooking videos
00:46:45 and then she started doing a video series
00:46:47 where she debunks
00:46:49 fake cooking videos
00:46:51 where people are like, oh hey
00:46:53 pour some batter into a paper bag
00:46:55 microwave it, instant brownie
00:46:57 and they have all these recipes
00:46:59 that are literally impossible
00:47:01 or will actually kill you
00:47:03 and she'll basically explain how the videos are fake
00:47:05 and she'll
00:47:07 life hack.
00:47:09 No big cheesecake.
00:47:11 Put cheese in a bowl
00:47:13 and then put flour in it
00:47:15 and mix it up and yeah.
00:47:17 Cheesecake.
00:47:19 Yeah, I see.
00:47:21 It's pretty good videos
00:47:23 but then she made a lot of them
00:47:25 and I don't want to watch a lot of videos of this.
00:47:27 Yeah.
00:47:29 Speaking of
00:47:31 speaking of debunking
00:47:33 I had never seen
00:47:35 a Doctor Disillusion
00:47:37 No, a Captain Disillusion.
00:47:39 I finally watched
00:47:41 I think Gib mentioned
00:47:43 him in my discord
00:47:45 a couple days ago
00:47:47 and I just was like okay
00:47:49 and I went and looked up a video
00:47:51 and I watched a whole bunch of them
00:47:53 and they're so good, they're so cool.
00:47:55 Have you gone back
00:47:57 to his earliest video from 2007?
00:47:59 No.
00:48:01 Alright, I want you to do that now
00:48:03 and just watch the first few seconds
00:48:07 because it's freaky
00:48:09 Are you gonna post it?
00:48:11 Yeah.
00:48:13 Let me just link it.
00:48:15 I can't wait.
00:48:17 It's so...
00:48:19 This is from 2007.
00:48:21 It looks like Kramer.
00:48:23 Penguin slap debunk.
00:48:25 It looks the same.
00:48:27 Exactly, it looks the same.
00:48:29 He's been doing this shit
00:48:31 for so long
00:48:33 at such a high quality.
00:48:35 It's crazy.
00:48:37 I mean, it's a little less fancy
00:48:39 and he looks younger
00:48:41 and thinner.
00:48:43 So I mean, good for him.
00:48:45 But, yeah, other than that
00:48:47 kind of the same.
00:48:49 It's crazy like
00:48:51 how
00:48:53 good he was early on
00:48:55 and how unknown he was until recently.
00:48:57 I discovered him...
00:48:59 Is that true? Was he unknown until recently?
00:49:01 Well, I mean
00:49:03 recently on the scale of
00:49:05 doing this shit for 14 years,
00:49:07 I suppose.
00:49:09 I discovered him in 2015.
00:49:11 I saw the floating city
00:49:13 debunk video
00:49:15 because I saw that floating around
00:49:17 and people were saying, oh, it's a hologram
00:49:19 and I have a government
00:49:21 that's a mirage and I'm like, it can't be a mirage
00:49:23 because
00:49:25 the buildings are seen from a low angle
00:49:27 and if it was some kind of reflection
00:49:29 you'd see an upside down version
00:49:31 of them or some shit was what I was thinking.
00:49:33 I just found his video on it
00:49:35 and I was like, what the fuck?
00:49:37 What is this production value?
00:49:39 And he had 60k subscribers at that point.
00:49:41 And I checked his social
00:49:43 blade
00:49:45 and he had been sitting at 25k
00:49:47 for a very long time.
00:49:49 That's not even
00:49:51 even for like early YouTube
00:49:53 that's not even that much.
00:49:55 Yeah, and the 25k
00:49:57 had only been for like the past two years
00:49:59 because he had like one video blow up
00:50:01 before that he was like
00:50:03 around 10k
00:50:05 and he was like getting no subscribers for years, it seemed.
00:50:07 That's insane.
00:50:09 I mean, now he's gone big.
00:50:11 It was right after I discovered him
00:50:13 he started blowing up so clearly.
00:50:15 So something must have really hit.
00:50:17 Was it the
00:50:19 I remember the first time
00:50:21 I ever heard of Captain Disillusion
00:50:23 it was when
00:50:25 I don't remember who was talking about it
00:50:27 but some other video was talking about
00:50:29 his video debunking
00:50:31 the staircase.
00:50:33 The infinite staircase, you know what I'm talking about?
00:50:35 The Asherian stairwell.
00:50:37 Yeah, and someone
00:50:39 someone was criticizing him.
00:50:41 I think they said that
00:50:43 his video was
00:50:45 was like too cruel
00:50:47 to the
00:50:49 to the creator
00:50:51 of it because he was critical of that guy
00:50:53 for like, you know, basically turning
00:50:55 an art project into like a hoax.
00:50:57 I'm trying to think
00:50:59 it's perfectly fine to be critical of that.
00:51:01 Yeah, it was.
00:51:03 It is.
00:51:07 Dammit.
00:51:09 I don't remember who.
00:51:11 I don't remember whose video I watched
00:51:13 Captain Disillusion.
00:51:15 They criticized Captain Disillusion
00:51:17 for his take on it.
00:51:19 I don't remember where it was.
00:51:21 Oh well.
00:51:23 I mean
00:51:25 I don't know why you would criticize for that.
00:51:29 In hindsight, yeah, I don't either.
00:51:31 I don't
00:51:33 I wish I could remember because I'm like
00:51:35 yeah, why would you do that?
00:51:37 He did nothing wrong.
00:51:39 Because then
00:51:41 I watched
00:51:43 a bunch of
00:51:45 those Captain Disillusion videos
00:51:47 and I finally saw that one
00:51:49 the staircase one that I had only heard
00:51:51 about second hand
00:51:53 previously and I watched it and I was like
00:51:55 yeah, he is critical of that guy but like
00:51:57 it's kind of
00:51:59 only in the sense that
00:52:01 people who fall down the rabbit hole
00:52:03 of believing
00:52:05 UFO conspiracies
00:52:07 up until like
00:52:09 you know, COVID
00:52:11 denial stuff and all that
00:52:13 like weird fake videos
00:52:15 or like sort of what helped shape their world view
00:52:17 of everything being fake man
00:52:19 so like contributing to that is generally
00:52:21 not a good idea even if it is
00:52:23 for an art project it's good to like
00:52:25 be like hey, by the way, this is fake
00:52:27 just so you know.
00:52:29 Yeah.
00:52:31 See if this proves the lizard men are real.
00:52:35 My boy
00:52:37 Jack Saint made a video
00:52:39 one time
00:52:41 that I really liked. I really liked it
00:52:43 it was a
00:52:45 it was the story of like
00:52:47 a town
00:52:49 in
00:52:51 the US. I forget what the name of the town
00:52:53 was but it was like a
00:52:55 the story basically went
00:52:57 that there was like a telecommunications company
00:52:59 that set up like
00:53:01 a new like internet
00:53:03 service provider like hub
00:53:05 in the town and it like something went wrong
00:53:07 with it and it started to
00:53:09 like produce a noise
00:53:11 it started to produce a constant noise and like
00:53:13 the noise was like unsettling
00:53:15 to the residents and they started to
00:53:17 they you know a lot of them couldn't sleep
00:53:19 a lot of them started to become
00:53:21 like you know have like
00:53:23 mood problems and like a lot of them
00:53:25 they became irate and they started
00:53:27 having like you know it caused
00:53:29 all these all these all these
00:53:31 all the problems you would expect of everyone being constantly
00:53:33 assaulted with an unpleasant noise
00:53:35 that makes it hard to sleep all the time
00:53:37 until and and and and the telecommunications
00:53:39 company just like kept
00:53:41 basically just kept doing like PR
00:53:43 about it and being like
00:53:45 pretending the issue was solved even when it wasn't
00:53:47 and like you know it led to like
00:53:49 you know it led to like some shooting some accidental shooting
00:53:51 deaths in the neighborhood
00:53:53 it was not it turned out it was not a real
00:53:55 story I thought it was a real story
00:53:57 he he later said like
00:53:59 yeah this was like a work of fiction
00:54:01 that I wrote and like
00:54:03 it and like I was like
00:54:05 oh okay well I guess I liked it as a
00:54:07 story and it had like you know it was a
00:54:09 fable about you know capitalism
00:54:11 bad it was like yeah okay
00:54:13 but I think he apologized
00:54:15 because he was like yeah maybe I should
00:54:17 have made it more clear that this was like a
00:54:19 a work of fiction
00:54:21 I was like yeah
00:54:23 yeah I feel a little duped
00:54:25 I feel a little bit duped because I thought this was a real thing you were telling me
00:54:27 I watched the whole video and I
00:54:29 oh I felt I felt kind of stupid I felt like
00:54:31 um
00:54:33 he sort of implied that like you were supposed
00:54:35 to know that it was a fake story
00:54:37 I was like well I didn't I guess
00:54:39 I'm a rube
00:54:41 um
00:54:43 oops
00:54:45 yeah yeah
00:54:47 you gotta watch out
00:54:49 you can't be spreading
00:54:51 spreading fake shit
00:54:53 yeah like a lot of people have told captain
00:54:55 this illusion like oh why don't you make
00:54:57 your own fake UFO video and then reveal it
00:54:59 was you after it goes viral how'd that be
00:55:01 so funny and he's just like I mean I
00:55:03 could do that it would be funny
00:55:05 the people who are in on the joke would
00:55:07 find would be very you know entertained
00:55:09 but a lot of people
00:55:11 are gonna see that video without seeing
00:55:13 the correction and they're just gonna be like
00:55:15 yeah see man this is what the government's
00:55:17 hiding from us the aliens man
00:55:19 and he you know
00:55:21 it's not and that means it's not
00:55:23 worth it which I respect that's
00:55:25 in that's integrity I think
00:55:27 that's what integrity is I mean
00:55:29 is it
00:55:31 so
00:55:33 okay so I guess I guess the client the contention
00:55:35 there is that
00:55:37 if you if you make a if you make
00:55:39 a if you make something that looks
00:55:41 impossible and you put it out there
00:55:43 and then you debunk it
00:55:45 like it does more
00:55:47 it does more harm by
00:55:49 showing the fake
00:55:51 thing then then it does
00:55:53 good by like by debunking
00:55:55 something that's fake and showing
00:55:57 like this is how it can be faked
00:55:59 because
00:56:01 like debunking is good
00:56:03 like in the sense that like
00:56:05 people are putting out fake stuff
00:56:07 into the world
00:56:09 and you can like debunk it and like
00:56:11 you know
00:56:13 some people will be like oh okay that was fake but like
00:56:15 ultimately like
00:56:17 the fake thing would have convinced
00:56:19 a few people and then you can unconvince
00:56:21 a few of them but some of us people still got convinced
00:56:23 so like the net is still
00:56:25 in the bad direction
00:56:27 probably
00:56:29 maybe
00:56:31 I feel like
00:56:33 it's theoretically possible
00:56:35 that you might
00:56:37 debunk something
00:56:39 in such spectacular fashion
00:56:41 that the debunking
00:56:43 gets more
00:56:45 seen more than
00:56:47 the original thing itself
00:56:49 that's true
00:56:51 possibly
00:56:53 you might not be able to guarantee that that happens
00:56:55 so I guess I understand
00:56:57 why you might still not want to do it
00:56:59 it's probably like more of like a principle thing
00:57:01 than a like
00:57:03 I'm doing my utilitarian calculation
00:57:05 of how many people this will
00:57:07 bring which way or the other way
00:57:11 in any case captain D
00:57:13 probably
00:57:15 one of my favorite YouTubers ever
00:57:17 I binge his entire channel like twice a year
00:57:19 because the videos are just
00:57:21 very watchable
00:57:23 I was
00:57:25 binging the other day I didn't finish
00:57:27 I have more to binge
00:57:29 I have more captain D
00:57:31 than I haven't seen yet
00:57:33 it is all good shit
00:57:35 he did a long video
00:57:37 recently about
00:57:39 Flight of the Navigator
00:57:41 I skipped out on it
00:57:43 because I was like I kind of just want to see more
00:57:45 of the regular
00:57:47 the main videos
00:57:49 I mean
00:57:51 lowkey me too
00:57:53 but I still thought
00:57:55 the video was pretty cool
00:57:57 it was still good
00:57:59 it's interesting to talk about how the movie
00:58:01 was made like that's fine and all
00:58:03 but like you know
00:58:05 it's not as dense
00:58:07 it's not as densely interesting
00:58:09 as the D-Boom videos
00:58:11 I can't
00:58:13 I couldn't
00:58:15 I couldn't fucking believe
00:58:17 I don't know
00:58:19 I couldn't believe
00:58:21 he did the laminar flow
00:58:23 when he made the
00:58:25 I looked at his most popular video
00:58:27 I think his second most popular video was
00:58:29 the laminar flow
00:58:31 proof
00:58:33 and it's just like no it's just real
00:58:35 it's just real and like here it is
00:58:37 and then he just does it
00:58:39 oh okay
00:58:41 wow
00:58:43 that was so fucking
00:58:45 funny that video
00:58:47 the ending where like he's like
00:58:49 but if I did want to fake it and then he has
00:58:51 the fucking water flying all around the room
00:58:53 and doing all this crazy shit
00:58:55 yeah and he's touching it and like
00:58:57 he's just fucking
00:58:59 showing off his visual effects skills
00:59:01 because like to me
00:59:03 because I do
00:59:05 visual effects, animation, editing
00:59:07 sort of shit for a living
00:59:09 so the video of his
00:59:11 I mean I was watching him for like
00:59:13 two years before he even came out
00:59:15 the tape measure video was one of my favorite ones
00:59:17 I saw that one
00:59:19 it's not just that he like
00:59:21 you know explains how the video was faked
00:59:23 he will like
00:59:25 somehow like create
00:59:27 a version of the video where he has
00:59:29 removed the visual effects
00:59:31 and like given like the blank like raw
00:59:33 footage back which is so hard to do
00:59:35 we have to like erase the effects and like
00:59:37 paint the background back in
00:59:39 and match the camera movements and shit
00:59:41 and then he'll edit himself into the scene
00:59:43 like to be like look this is how I set up the effect
00:59:45 and you see him walking around in the video setting shit up
00:59:47 and it's like that is so much fucking
00:59:49 work that is like way more work than like
00:59:51 was actually put into the original thing
00:59:53 then they made to make the video in the first place
00:59:55 yeah
00:59:57 it's like if someone gave you a fucking Marvel movie
00:59:59 and you gave it to a guy
01:00:01 and he just turned it back into the green screen room
01:00:03 and like removed everything
01:00:05 that would be really fucking hard to do
01:00:07 I really liked
01:00:09 that one the
01:00:11 tape measure one
01:00:13 and also I think there's another one of like
01:00:15 they're throwing knives
01:00:17 like they're throwing knives at a girl and she like catches them
01:00:19 on ping pong paddles
01:00:21 that was the first one that like
01:00:23 bumped him up to 25k I think
01:00:25 with subscribers
01:00:27 that was the first big video he had
01:00:29 I mean not even
01:00:31 his
01:00:33 I mean his debunking is interesting but like
01:00:35 the reason it's so interesting is because it's like
01:00:37 wow they did this
01:00:39 but they didn't use like
01:00:41 fancy fucking
01:00:43 they didn't use like super technology software
01:00:45 to make like perfect 3D
01:00:47 effects they just
01:00:49 they did it with like
01:00:51 weird little practical tricks
01:00:53 that you're like you just kind of don't notice
01:00:55 when you see it and when you hear it explained
01:00:57 you're like like oh
01:00:59 she already had the knives sticking in the ping pong paddles
01:01:01 she was just holding them backwards
01:01:03 so you couldn't see them
01:01:05 and then she flips them around in one frame
01:01:07 and then it looks like they catch the knife on it but no
01:01:09 they were just already there
01:01:11 oh my god they tricked me
01:01:13 they tricked me
01:01:15 they got me so good
01:01:17 um
01:01:19 yeah the
01:01:21 the way that they cheated
01:01:23 and they like
01:01:25 you know they have the thing
01:01:27 like one shot
01:01:29 like someone must have just sat down and been like
01:01:31 hmm how can I
01:01:33 how can I make it look
01:01:35 like my tape measure
01:01:37 how can I make it look like my tape measure
01:01:39 is coming out of the little thing
01:01:41 and going to a
01:01:43 port-a-potty door and pulling the door open
01:01:45 if I drilled a hole and I put a wire through the door
01:01:47 so you could pull it
01:01:49 and then I cut the two shots together
01:01:51 it's like
01:01:53 it's very admirable
01:01:55 that someone sat down and figured all this out
01:01:57 in the
01:01:59 I guess they work for an ad agency
01:02:01 so they were like well I gotta make some
01:02:03 I gotta make some
01:02:05 video of some weird impossible looking shit
01:02:07 so um
01:02:09 what can I throw together
01:02:11 with some guys in like a lumber yard
01:02:13 um
01:02:15 oh yeah
01:02:17 yeah so good
01:02:19 very cool
01:02:21 um
01:02:23 duh
01:02:25 how you been
01:02:27 how's your life
01:02:29 how's your life going
01:02:31 my life is going cool
01:02:33 I should mention
01:02:35 the GoFundMe
01:02:37 yes the GoFundMe
01:02:39 I saw that
01:02:41 I think I mentioned earlier
01:02:43 in this very episode right now
01:02:45 whoa
01:02:47 I think in 2017
01:02:49 like
01:02:51 my girlfriend was harassed by a nurse
01:02:53 for being asexual
01:02:55 yeah
01:02:57 it turns out
01:02:59 that the reason they were asexual
01:03:01 is because
01:03:03 they were
01:03:05 they're trans
01:03:07 and they just didn't know it yet
01:03:09 that's crazy
01:03:11 having big honking titties
01:03:13 kinda sucks when
01:03:15 you're a boy
01:03:17 I guess so
01:03:19 it might yeah
01:03:21 it might possibly
01:03:23 maybe just a little bit
01:03:25 so
01:03:27 we're doing
01:03:29 they've been transitioning for about 3 years
01:03:31 about almost 2 years on hormones
01:03:33 um
01:03:35 so we're overdue
01:03:37 we could've, I think
01:03:39 most places will let you get top surgery after a year
01:03:41 so we've been doing it for nearly 2 years
01:03:43 with the hormone stuff
01:03:45 and
01:03:47 we need to raise the link
01:03:49 we need to raise like $10,000
01:03:51 because fucking health insurance
01:03:53 I believe I was the first donor
01:03:55 I believe I was the first donor
01:03:57 yeah I saw you sent a funny
01:03:59 you sent 20 funny bucks
01:04:01 sorry
01:04:03 sorry my American currency is so
01:04:05 so hilarious
01:04:07 American
01:04:09 American currency
01:04:11 the reason it's funny is because I sent you
01:04:13 like about 20 bucks like a week before
01:04:15 like a week before
01:04:17 oh that's right
01:04:19 oh yeah so it all
01:04:21 what goes around comes around
01:04:23 exactly
01:04:25 well basically you're just trading
01:04:27 your husband's tits
01:04:29 for a copy of Roger Radclon
01:04:31 that comic must be worth a lot then
01:04:33 damn
01:04:35 oh yeah that's
01:04:37 that's just called doing business
01:04:39 making deals
01:04:41 but
01:04:43 you know storytelling is
01:04:45 a donation to this cause
01:04:47 is a donation for gay sex
01:04:49 see I've been, we've been married
01:04:51 like 5 years
01:04:53 sex what even is that
01:04:55 they haven't been comfortable with their body
01:04:57 but this sort of shit is helping
01:04:59 since they started taking hormones
01:05:01 they were like oh hey, hey, sex maybe it's cool
01:05:03 so help me get like
01:05:05 this is what I'm saying
01:05:07 I
01:05:09 I
01:05:11 what more can I add
01:05:13 what more can I even say
01:05:15 I guess we'll probably
01:05:17 put the link down in the description to
01:05:19 support the
01:05:21 top top surgery
01:05:23 expense
01:05:25 you know it's good
01:05:27 good for them living
01:05:29 their best
01:05:31 life and making moves
01:05:33 yeah it is generally
01:05:35 awkward
01:05:37 like having
01:05:39 big booby in the way
01:05:41 cause I don't want to touch it cause they're not comfortable with it
01:05:43 but I want to like hug them
01:05:45 and tell them they're cool
01:05:47 and go jogging
01:05:49 they can't go jogging
01:05:51 I can't even look at them
01:05:53 I have to like avert my eyes
01:06:01 tell me more
01:06:05 I don't know
01:06:07 exercise sucks
01:06:09 a lot of things suck they get in the way
01:06:11 you know
01:06:13 these boobs were not meant for this world
01:06:15 they must go so help with that
01:06:17 and
01:06:19 it'll be epic
01:06:23 you know what's epic
01:06:25 you know what's epic
01:06:27 the epic game store
01:06:29 yeah
01:06:31 what's epic Ben
01:06:33 I don't know I was gonna say
01:06:35 something about
01:06:37 how do I
01:06:39 concoct some sort of like
01:06:41 man it's good
01:06:43 when a person
01:06:45 gets to
01:06:47 be the most
01:06:49 authentically
01:06:51 realized version of their
01:06:53 their authentic self
01:06:55 and whatever
01:06:57 when they have the opportunity
01:06:59 to
01:07:01 make you know
01:07:03 the most liberated
01:07:05 liberation of their self
01:07:07 from the shackles
01:07:09 of flesh and blood existence
01:07:11 I don't know
01:07:13 do you ever have a dream where you
01:07:15 can do anything Ben
01:07:17 um
01:07:19 yeah
01:07:25 bro
01:07:27 lucid dreaming
01:07:29 it's like
01:07:31 you can
01:07:33 control it and shit
01:07:35 you can do anything
01:07:37 you can make it happen
01:07:39 I swear for a certain portion of my life
01:07:41 lucid dreaming was like an MMO
01:07:43 that sometimes if my brain
01:07:45 was lucky I would log in and I would retain
01:07:47 my skills from the last time I lucid dreamed
01:07:49 and I could like level up and shit
01:07:51 um and I save this
01:07:53 metaphorically it was more of it like
01:07:55 each time I lucid dreamed I had like
01:07:57 better control over what happened
01:07:59 I could fly easier
01:08:01 things we just generally
01:08:03 like
01:08:05 this is the plot of secret
01:08:07 in the basement
01:08:09 secret in the basement is that a book?
01:08:11 is that a game?
01:08:13 yeah that's the
01:08:15 spiritual sequel to
01:08:17 legend of the ten elemental masters
01:08:19 it's Ululilia's second book
01:08:21 Ulululu
01:08:23 yeah it's the second book
01:08:25 that's about
01:08:27 I guess
01:08:29 okay it's not actually about
01:08:31 like the kid does
01:08:33 he has RPG
01:08:35 adventures in his dreams
01:08:37 but like he first becomes
01:08:39 okay
01:08:41 it is while he's dreaming
01:08:43 but it's not a dream
01:08:45 it's a real place that he goes
01:08:47 when he dreams
01:08:49 and it's in his basement
01:08:51 so
01:08:53 you would think that he
01:08:55 would either go there in his dreams
01:08:57 or he would find a secret portal in his basement
01:08:59 but no it's both
01:09:01 in his dreams he can find
01:09:03 a secret portal in his basement that takes him to
01:09:05 a real place
01:09:07 that gives him superpowers
01:09:09 oh shit
01:09:11 secret in the basement
01:09:13 is such a funny book
01:09:15 it's okay
01:09:17 the thing that maybe makes it worse
01:09:19 than
01:09:21 ten elemental masters
01:09:23 one it's not about like funny
01:09:25 like fucking tiny
01:09:27 like colorful wizard people
01:09:29 aliens it's just about a kid
01:09:31 and that's boring
01:09:33 I hate children
01:09:35 and it's really long
01:09:37 it's a thick book
01:09:39 and it's kind of repetitive
01:09:41 and it probably didn't need to be as long as it did
01:09:43 but
01:09:45 it kind of flips back and forth between
01:09:47 have you read
01:09:49 ten elemental masters
01:09:51 I've
01:09:53 only heard the name
01:09:55 come from your mouth Ben
01:09:57 on the pcp
01:09:59 I see
01:10:01 I don't think I've really heard of it anywhere else
01:10:03 I don't know anything about it really
01:10:05 well I made a let's read video
01:10:07 I made a let's read video
01:10:09 with terrible video quality
01:10:11 I was really ashamed
01:10:13 that you were reading the book out loud
01:10:15 instead of reading it in your mind
01:10:17 how
01:10:19 but then I couldn't
01:10:21 I couldn't make a video
01:10:23 okay
01:10:25 you say that but like Gib
01:10:27 did her let's read series
01:10:29 years ago
01:10:31 and she didn't have to say anything
01:10:35 she sat down with the book
01:10:37 and she just opened it and then it was just like
01:10:39 ten minutes of just flicking pages
01:10:41 and then there was an N word
01:10:43 then that was it
01:10:47 yeah I should
01:10:49 I should take a page out of her book I guess
01:10:53 well
01:10:55 I kind of want to do
01:10:57 one of those but like with better
01:10:59 video quality and a better
01:11:01 shot
01:11:03 with Secret on the Basement
01:11:05 Secret on the Basement is funny because
01:11:07 in ten elemental
01:11:09 masters it's just about this
01:11:11 weird
01:11:13 sort of autistic
01:11:15 alien
01:11:17 who like just never
01:11:19 doesn't give a fuck about anything
01:11:21 and he can't relate to these humans at all
01:11:23 cause he's just like oh food
01:11:25 I just create
01:11:27 nutrient molecules in my body
01:11:29 I never need to eat
01:11:31 but here's some waffles
01:11:33 here's some breakfast waffles for you kids
01:11:35 oh light so you can see
01:11:37 oh I can see in every spectrum in the world
01:11:39 so I don't need light but like here
01:11:41 I'll just illuminate my
01:11:43 spectrums
01:11:45 he's like oh yeah
01:11:47 I live in a
01:11:49 concrete
01:11:51 a featureless
01:11:53 cubic concrete bunker
01:11:55 deep underground with no light
01:11:57 anywhere because I don't need light to see by
01:11:59 but I guess since these kids are visiting
01:12:01 I will
01:12:03 make my concrete bunker a little bigger
01:12:05 for them and I will
01:12:07 illuminate it with a light source
01:12:09 and I guess I will make
01:12:11 beds for them to sleep in
01:12:13 with fun patterns on the sheets
01:12:15 that look like
01:12:17 things they like
01:12:19 what a gentleman
01:12:21 he has a complete gentleman
01:12:23 secret in the basement is different
01:12:25 cause it's about a kid so like half of the book
01:12:27 is like the kid just like
01:12:29 living his normal life and going to school
01:12:31 and dealing with bullies
01:12:33 but it's funny dealing with
01:12:35 bullies
01:12:37 to the kid in secret in the basement
01:12:39 bullies means that like
01:12:41 one kid like calls him
01:12:43 like makes like a bad
01:12:45 pun in class
01:12:47 and the teacher gets mad and gives him
01:12:49 like 14 detentions
01:12:51 and like that like that's
01:12:53 bully like that's what a bully does
01:12:55 in Ululili's mind
01:12:57 is like be rude in class
01:12:59 and the teacher is like
01:13:01 that's one detention that's two detentions
01:13:03 that's ten more detentions
01:13:05 and then later on all the good
01:13:07 non-bully kids go wow
01:13:09 I can't believe Jessica got 14 detentions
01:13:11 that's gotta be a record
01:13:13 damn what a bully
01:13:17 that's epic
01:13:19 this is a place of learning
01:13:21 you shouldn't be making puns clearly
01:13:23 no like
01:13:25 sometimes
01:13:27 sometimes
01:13:29 they'll make like a
01:13:31 shitty pun
01:13:33 about something the teacher says
01:13:35 and the teacher will go haha
01:13:37 good one but you shouldn't be making jokes
01:13:39 in class I'm gonna have to give you a detention
01:13:41 for that
01:13:43 like
01:13:45 the teacher will be impressed
01:13:47 but I have to I have to discipline you
01:13:49 for this
01:13:51 so we got the ten elements
01:13:53 earth, water, fire, air, detentions
01:13:57 one of the fundamental forces
01:14:01 and it's
01:14:03 it's a more fun book because
01:14:05 the kid starts out as normal
01:14:07 but then like in his
01:14:09 dream basement adventures
01:14:13 he levels up and he improves
01:14:15 his stats
01:14:17 but the stat increases carry over into
01:14:19 the real world so by the end of
01:14:21 the book
01:14:23 he's literally like stopping burglaries
01:14:25 by like casting ice spells
01:14:27 on like at camp
01:14:29 like at summer camp and stuff
01:14:31 and he's like
01:14:33 he's like tracking down like fellow
01:14:35 like kids that like
01:14:37 got possessed by demons and like went on
01:14:39 like got lost in the woods he's like tracking
01:14:41 them down and like exercising them with light
01:14:43 spells and shit
01:14:45 and
01:14:47 and it's very funny because
01:14:49 everyone around him is just like
01:14:51 wow where did you learn to cast
01:14:53 spells that's neat
01:14:55 oh well I won't ask
01:14:57 any further questions
01:14:59 it's normal
01:15:01 yeah everyone's like wow
01:15:03 I can't believe you I can't believe
01:15:05 you can do you know 19
01:15:07 pull-ups a second
01:15:09 and can like leap
01:15:11 like a hundred feet in the air
01:15:13 that sure is impressive anyway
01:15:15 what were we talking about
01:15:17 bye
01:15:19 god that's funny
01:15:21 it is funny it is funny
01:15:23 I feel like
01:15:25 I don't know if I
01:15:27 like
01:15:29 do you mind if I spoil the ending
01:15:31 spoil as much as you want
01:15:33 the spoilers for Seeker of the Basement
01:15:35 the ending in the end
01:15:37 when his
01:15:39 dream adventures have come to an end
01:15:41 he's got all these
01:15:43 fucking powers his stats are so high
01:15:45 he becomes
01:15:47 a movie star he becomes
01:15:49 like a superhero movie star
01:15:51 but like because
01:15:53 they don't use special effects
01:15:55 he acts in superhero movies
01:15:57 as
01:15:59 himself
01:16:01 because he just has superpowers in real life
01:16:03 why
01:16:05 and then he spends the rest of his life
01:16:07 like well I did that
01:16:09 so now I'll
01:16:11 he just like he becomes a gold medalist
01:16:13 in every Olympic event
01:16:15 he becomes a star
01:16:17 player in every sport
01:16:19 in every league he just wins every fucking trophy
01:16:21 in every league just because he can
01:16:23 they just let him in
01:16:25 they just let the superhuman in
01:16:27 well yeah they do
01:16:29 they just do
01:16:31 at least you're not a woman
01:16:33 if you're a woman we couldn't let you compete
01:16:35 where in the rulebook does it say us
01:16:37 you know
01:16:39 a level 10,000 wizard from
01:16:41 the dream realm can't be
01:16:43 a basketball player or whatever
01:16:45 there's no rule against it
01:16:47 if you were a trans woman that would be
01:16:49 an unfair advantage
01:16:51 but yeah
01:16:53 but no you leveled up
01:16:55 your stats legit you did it
01:16:57 like everyone else you went to the dream world
01:16:59 and you tapped on the little thing
01:17:01 and the wizard with like the barber pole
01:17:03 sign
01:17:05 like gave you
01:17:07 you bought your cosmos helm
01:17:09 from the store
01:17:11 with your igani
01:17:13 you collected igani like everyone else
01:17:15 it's just legit
01:17:17 why shouldn't it just worked harder
01:17:19 he picked himself up by his bootstraps
01:17:21 but the end
01:17:23 when he's finally done
01:17:25 when he's finally done just achieving
01:17:27 peak human accomplishment in every field
01:17:29 of endeavor that exists
01:17:31 what he decides to do with the rest of his life
01:17:33 is become a cop
01:17:35 he's just like well
01:17:37 yeah he's like well I've done everything there is
01:17:39 to do in the world I'm a champion of everything
01:17:41 all I can do now
01:17:43 now it's just like what am I gonna
01:17:45 how can I do the most good in the world
01:17:47 I'm gonna be a cop and I'll fucking
01:17:49 and I'll like fucking cast ice spells
01:17:51 on burglars and like petty
01:17:53 and petty criminals
01:17:55 and drug dealers and stuff
01:17:57 that's the best way to help the world
01:17:59 freezing burglars
01:18:01 nuts off
01:18:03 Ululilia loves cops
01:18:05 he thinks cops are the good guys
01:18:07 and criminals are bad guys
01:18:09 he should have just fucking like it was a mistake
01:18:11 like I can like
01:18:13 Ululilia
01:18:15 I made a mistake like one
01:18:17 like what did this kid
01:18:19 do to get good at acting first of all
01:18:21 why doesn't he just
01:18:23 why doesn't he just work for a VFX team
01:18:25 why doesn't he just like
01:18:27 why isn't he just like
01:18:29 the pyrotechnic guy except he just
01:18:31 shoots the flames out of his fucking asshole you know
01:18:33 instead of
01:18:35 he doesn't have to be the main character to do the elemental stuff
01:18:37 honestly honestly it's
01:18:39 I think in
01:18:41 in Ululilia's mind
01:18:43 he wrote this character to just be a kind of
01:18:45 idealized like good guy
01:18:47 who everyone likes
01:18:49 but
01:18:51 in actuality the character comes off
01:18:53 as an extremely off putting
01:18:55 like weirdo
01:18:57 who like responds
01:18:59 with complete deadpan appreciation
01:19:01 whenever anyone makes a shitty pun
01:19:03 he just goes like
01:19:05 haha that was a very funny joke
01:19:07 he just told
01:19:09 and he goes um
01:19:11 he likes to like he likes to correct people
01:19:13 he's a he's a big smart ass who likes to correct
01:19:15 people and he just likes to bring
01:19:17 up like like a trivia that nobody
01:19:19 cares about in in random situations
01:19:21 he will just he will just start like citing
01:19:23 Wikipedia pages
01:19:25 and be like I know I know a lot about
01:19:27 I know a lot about you know
01:19:29 constellations and astronomy
01:19:31 that that star that's the dog star
01:19:33 serious that's this constellation canis
01:19:35 major you know he's just like some like
01:19:37 obnoxious book nerd like I know all about
01:19:39 the launch dates for the James Webb space telescope
01:19:41 did you know the telescope was supposed to be
01:19:43 launched in 2017
01:19:45 yeah basically but but but you know
01:19:47 he
01:19:49 but in his mind this character he's just a nice
01:19:51 smart guy who everyone likes
01:19:53 and
01:19:55 so why why can't he also be a movie star
01:19:57 why can't he also be you know
01:19:59 the charismatic leading man
01:20:01 but how much how much sex
01:20:03 has had that's that's the real
01:20:05 measure I believe none
01:20:07 I believe I believe none
01:20:09 I don't think we are
01:20:11 he gets like a roommate he
01:20:13 moves in with like his female roommate
01:20:15 but I don't think they're dating
01:20:17 and I don't think he ever gets like a girlfriend
01:20:19 or anything he does he does
01:20:21 rescue a princess and the princess
01:20:23 like likes him but there's no
01:20:25 like there's no flirting or anything
01:20:27 they just he's just like
01:20:29 I've rescued you I just
01:20:31 just here to help you're welcome
01:20:33 okay bye
01:20:35 fight the final boss alright see ya
01:20:37 I feel like religious
01:20:39 huh I love is
01:20:41 really like a religious
01:20:43 do I love do I love Jesus
01:20:45 not to not to my knowledge
01:20:47 no not to my knowledge
01:20:49 I don't think so
01:20:51 there's no mention of like Jesus or
01:20:53 religion or anything and I guess I just
01:20:55 hate I guess I just hate sex
01:20:57 it's the only thing I can think of
01:20:59 I he might be I mean he could
01:21:01 be asexual I don't know
01:21:03 he never he never talks about like
01:21:05 romance or anything like you know I don't think
01:21:07 in any of his dream diaries he talks about
01:21:09 like attraction
01:21:11 or anything like that
01:21:13 not tonight
01:21:15 no he just loves you just loves video games
01:21:17 and he loves it when you
01:21:19 can go run really fast and jump really
01:21:21 high
01:21:23 that's what get that's what gets him off
01:21:25 those are admirable qualities for sure
01:21:27 I am
01:21:29 I think I might have mentioned this along
01:21:31 maybe months ago I talked to him again
01:21:33 and I asked him if he
01:21:35 I didn't I didn't ask him again about whether
01:21:37 he wanted me to make the audio book
01:21:39 for for legend of the 10 element masters
01:21:41 because it was he just seemed like so
01:21:43 uninterested in
01:21:45 discussing that I didn't even ask him
01:21:47 about that I just asked him like how he was doing
01:21:49 and he told me that he was
01:21:51 he told me about the game he was working on
01:21:53 he's making a new a new game
01:21:55 and he said he told me the name
01:21:57 of it and I mentioned it on the on the previous
01:21:59 episode I don't remember anymore what he called it
01:22:01 but it had a name
01:22:03 and he didn't even
01:22:05 he didn't share that much about it with me
01:22:07 but
01:22:09 platform masters
01:22:11 never came out it was never finished but like
01:22:13 the proof of concept for platform masters
01:22:15 basically was the game like it
01:22:17 I feel like we got a full idea of what it was
01:22:19 just from the trailers in which you are
01:22:21 just a little man's
01:22:23 and you run really fast and you jump really high
01:22:25 and there's extremely scientifically
01:22:27 accurate parallax scrolling in the background
01:22:29 that's what platform masters was
01:22:31 this one I don't know what it is
01:22:33 I hope it's something different
01:22:35 also I hope it gets done
01:22:37 I hope it becomes real one day
01:22:39 I mean having
01:22:41 scientifically accurate parallax is the most
01:22:43 important aspect of the video game
01:22:45 that was the thing that he was the most
01:22:47 interested about like in the videos where he talked
01:22:49 about the game he was making the thing that he
01:22:51 focused on the most was how he had calculated
01:22:53 the precise distances of the background
01:22:55 elements and he was like yes
01:22:57 they scroll at the precisely
01:22:59 scientifically accurate speeds
01:23:01 there was one where you were on Mars
01:23:03 there was one where you were on Mars
01:23:05 and you could see Earth
01:23:07 in the sky and he was like
01:23:09 yeah Earth moves
01:23:11 at the accurate like
01:23:13 if you run like thousands
01:23:15 of miles an hour you will see the Earth move
01:23:17 in the sky like a tiny
01:23:19 like one pixel yeah
01:23:21 barely at all but it does move
01:23:23 I mean
01:23:25 like the people at NASA
01:23:27 who you know created
01:23:29 the big dome over the sky
01:23:31 they should have factored that in they should have used his math
01:23:33 because you know we can see through
01:23:35 their lies
01:23:37 we know the planets are fake
01:23:39 they're not real
01:23:41 there's um
01:23:43 have you played Lisa
01:23:45 um Lisa
01:23:47 the painful
01:23:49 I know of it I've seen
01:23:51 a video on it
01:23:53 there is a part
01:23:55 in Lisa
01:23:57 you know the game is set
01:23:59 in this town of Olaf
01:24:01 and it's like a
01:24:03 post apocalypse but it's not clear if like
01:24:05 the entire world
01:24:07 is in an apocalypse or if it's just
01:24:09 Olaf like if Olaf is just like
01:24:11 somehow separated
01:24:13 from the world because you never hear
01:24:15 anything from outside you can never leave it
01:24:17 um
01:24:19 there's a secret area in one
01:24:21 section
01:24:23 you have to jump down a
01:24:25 a cliff in a spot that you wouldn't
01:24:27 think you would want to jump down but it's a secret
01:24:29 and the hint
01:24:31 of how to do it the hint for where
01:24:33 it is is that in the sky there are clouds
01:24:35 and this one cloud
01:24:37 is like tilt it's like tilted at an angle
01:24:39 and if you and that's
01:24:41 where it's like I guess it's maybe
01:24:43 supposed to be like pointing down
01:24:45 but it also makes me think like
01:24:47 the edge of the world is this like
01:24:49 is this like the sky dome
01:24:51 that I'm seeing
01:24:53 it's heading towards the ground at like a 45
01:24:55 degree angle here and that's why the clouds
01:24:57 are like that are painted on clearly
01:24:59 yeah yeah yeah
01:25:01 and it's like
01:25:03 is this the dome
01:25:05 is this the dome of the sky
01:25:07 is this uh
01:25:09 is Olaf just under like
01:25:11 is it like a Truman show
01:25:13 I was about to say this is season 2 of the Truman show clearly
01:25:15 yeah I'm not sure
01:25:17 I'm not sure if that's the implication
01:25:19 of like the the angled cloud
01:25:21 or if it's just like
01:25:23 just a visual hint
01:25:25 about the video game and I shouldn't even
01:25:27 read more into it
01:25:29 it's it's it's uh it's possible
01:25:31 um
01:25:33 uh bup bup bup uh man Lisa's so fucking good
01:25:35 what a what a good ass video game
01:25:37 funnily I funnily I played
01:25:39 video games you know
01:25:41 wait I hope I didn't delete this image
01:25:43 um there's a
01:25:45 I think the other night um
01:25:47 my husband and a couple of my friends were
01:25:49 looking at a website that like
01:25:51 looks at how many hours you've spent on steam
01:25:53 and how much money you've spent on steam games
01:25:55 and
01:25:57 it was it was uh
01:25:59 I'll link it
01:26:01 if you want to fuck with that stuff
01:26:03 uh sure
01:26:05 let's see where I put the link
01:26:07 I don't I don't I don't spend that much money on
01:26:11 sometimes I will go on steam
01:26:13 every like one year or so
01:26:15 I might go on steam
01:26:17 and buy a bunch of like uh
01:26:19 a bunch of like the cheapest games
01:26:21 I can find things that are on sale
01:26:23 and stuff for like a few dollars each
01:26:25 so I probably haven't spent
01:26:27 more than maybe like a hundred or something
01:26:29 dollars on steam in like my entire life
01:26:31 maybe two hundred I don't know
01:26:33 I've really ever put money into steam
01:26:35 but like
01:26:37 what I'm uh proud of I think
01:26:39 I may not have put the correct link in there
01:26:41 um
01:26:43 it says private
01:26:45 yeah I took a screenshot of the important part
01:26:47 um so
01:26:49 well let me see it it's all private
01:26:51 yeah I mean you can you I linked it
01:26:53 mainly so that you could input your
01:26:55 your stuff if you want to
01:26:57 oh I see I see
01:26:59 I set my profile to private afterwards
01:27:01 but
01:27:03 yeah so apparently the total hours I've put into steam
01:27:05 in history is like
01:27:07 1882
01:27:09 does that include like time spent playing games
01:27:11 I think that's I think that's just like
01:27:13 game time it just looks at all the game time
01:27:15 you have on all your games and adds it together
01:27:17 I have spent I have spent like eight hundred hours
01:27:19 playing Noida just just playing
01:27:21 Noida so
01:27:23 damn
01:27:25 I'm embarrassed to admit that
01:27:27 Noida is a good game though
01:27:29 it is a good game and I like it a lot
01:27:31 but when I think about like
01:27:33 what else could I have done with those
01:27:35 I mean I guess it would I mean I guess
01:27:37 it was 2020 quarantine like I think that's
01:27:39 part of why I put so much into it
01:27:41 I mean you could have played a Minecraft
01:27:43 of all those hours I could have been playing
01:27:45 Minecraft that whole time yeah
01:27:47 I could have been playing on the PCP Minecraft
01:27:49 server at patreon.com
01:27:51 the procrastinators to get access
01:27:53 to the Minecraft server which
01:27:55 we should do another we should do another shekels
01:27:57 for heckles this week we didn't do one last week
01:27:59 yeah
01:28:01 the thing I'm proud of with this
01:28:03 is in
01:28:05 2019 September so like about two years
01:28:07 ago they started calculating
01:28:09 hours per platform
01:28:11 so what this means
01:28:13 is it says the amount of time I spent in windows is
01:28:15 27 hours what that means is I've
01:28:17 only spent 27 hours playing games
01:28:19 in the last two years which is
01:28:21 cool I've been playing a lot less
01:28:23 games because I've been doing a lot more
01:28:25 work 27 hours and
01:28:27 that's nothing that's nothing at all
01:28:29 it is nothing and I think
01:28:31 you're not even a gamer
01:28:33 I think half of that is among us
01:28:35 no wonder you haven't been invited onto the gamer zone
01:28:37 exactly you know
01:28:39 having more subscribers than they
01:28:41 not good enough I have to be a gamer
01:28:43 oh yeah
01:28:45 you've
01:28:47 he's at like 100
01:28:49 he's 114
01:28:51 he's 114 I'm 116
01:28:53 congratulations
01:28:55 did you have like a recent bump
01:28:57 I had a bump
01:28:59 the come video last year but I talked on
01:29:01 when I was on the podcast one year ago
01:29:03 yeah yeah yeah
01:29:05 I was hoping to have a sequel out by now
01:29:07 but work's been fucking me up
01:29:09 I've had barely any time to animate anything
01:29:11 except for the last week where I've been
01:29:13 animating again including during this podcast
01:29:17 I have been
01:29:19 I have been tragically
01:29:21 tragically pulled away from my
01:29:23 work on my game
01:29:25 to do the lord of ghosts
01:29:27 a bonus comic
01:29:29 for the lord of ghosts book
01:29:31 and
01:29:33 it is
01:29:35 it's really big
01:29:37 frankly it's nine pages
01:29:39 I've spent the last two days just
01:29:41 drawing this one page
01:29:43 and it's like
01:29:47 I would say it qualifies as like slavery
01:29:49 wages
01:29:51 the amount I'm being paid to do it is frankly
01:29:53 I'm putting way more time into it
01:29:55 than I
01:29:57 have been compensated for
01:29:59 that's my choice
01:30:01 that was me when I was for
01:30:03 PCP editor basically
01:30:05 yeah it was
01:30:07 and you put
01:30:09 what am I trying to say
01:30:11 you went over and above
01:30:13 in terms of editing
01:30:15 so hard that you were like I can't do it anymore
01:30:17 and it's like well you don't have to
01:30:19 go so hard
01:30:21 you don't have to make every editing a masterpiece
01:30:23 and you were like no I have
01:30:25 I'm afraid there's no room to compromise on that
01:30:27 it will either be a masterpiece
01:30:29 or it will be nothing
01:30:31 goodbye
01:30:33 that's how I roll
01:30:35 I am incapable of like
01:30:37 it's passable
01:30:39 the PCP
01:30:41 this podcast
01:30:43 was very helpful for me
01:30:45 because I used to be even worse
01:30:47 if you can imagine
01:30:49 the thing about
01:30:51 PCP
01:30:53 in terms of my perfectionism
01:30:55 and not being able to let things go
01:30:57 and settle for good enough
01:30:59 because
01:31:01 my main skill is
01:31:03 I'm really really good at polishing things
01:31:05 making them really smooth
01:31:07 making them really shiny
01:31:09 the problem is sometimes I start out
01:31:11 with an idea that isn't that great
01:31:13 but I can polish it to where it looks shiny
01:31:15 and people like it
01:31:17 watching the PCPvo
01:31:19 it's like long before the PCP
01:31:21 I was watching
01:31:23 I was watching Tom's shit
01:31:25 in like 2013
01:31:27 like pony stuff
01:31:29 yeah your pony videos
01:31:31 actually recently 2013
01:31:33 yeah with the candlelight wedding video
01:31:35 that Tom did with
01:31:37 was that 2013
01:31:39 yeah the video that Tom did with Anthony C
01:31:41 for a candlelight wedding
01:31:43 I remember that video
01:31:45 wait what
01:31:47 2015
01:31:49 couldn't it be in 2015
01:31:51 because season 4 was started
01:31:53 late 2013 I think you're about a year off Ben
01:31:55 Jesus
01:31:57 okay alright
01:31:59 I know your history better than you
01:32:01 it seems
01:32:03 yeah the first t-bap episode was December
01:32:05 2014
01:32:07 wow okay
01:32:09 I thought it was like 2015
01:32:11 yeah okay
01:32:13 I remember it was in December
01:32:15 so okay
01:32:17 I guess you're right
01:32:19 damn yeah I for sure remember that
01:32:21 candlelight wedding video it's probably been deleted
01:32:23 right it's probably like not up anymore
01:32:25 because didn't Tom like scrub all his pony videos
01:32:27 coward
01:32:29 it's on Anthony C's channel
01:32:31 so it's still up
01:32:33 Anthony C
01:32:35 Anthony C is a cool guy
01:32:37 Anthony C
01:32:39 he commented on the last video
01:32:41 he commented on the last video wanting to see
01:32:43 Cassie's drawing
01:32:45 because someone had commissioned Cassie to draw
01:32:47 a bunch of brony
01:32:49 people
01:32:51 and he commented like where can I see it
01:32:53 and I don't know
01:32:55 I also have not seen it
01:32:57 someone
01:32:59 send Anthony C
01:33:01 that picture if you know
01:33:03 where it is I guess
01:33:05 I suppose
01:33:07 you suppose well you don't think so
01:33:09 you don't think they should
01:33:11 if they know where it is
01:33:13 the man wants to see the
01:33:15 damn drawing
01:33:19 save him
01:33:21 okay
01:33:23 I was watching all you guys
01:33:25 pretty early on
01:33:27 and you guys were the fucking best
01:33:29 in the analysis sphere
01:33:31 that was obvious
01:33:33 everyone was shit except you guys
01:33:35 I think that's true
01:33:37 I think that is true
01:33:39 I'm glad
01:33:41 a lot of very annoying
01:33:43 personalities in that community
01:33:47 I was looking at a time lapse video
01:33:49 I think this
01:33:51 it was for the art telephone thing in the draw cast
01:33:53 talking about how are we going to edit the time lapse footage
01:33:55 I'm so sorry
01:33:57 are you going to be editing at all
01:33:59 it's fine I've edited time lapses before
01:34:01 so I looked at an old time lapse I had done
01:34:03 to see how many hours it was
01:34:05 because I used to time lapse my pony animations
01:34:07 one of them
01:34:09 when you say time lapse
01:34:11 you mean like a show your work
01:34:13 kind of
01:34:15 it's a 7 minute video with
01:34:17 60 hours of OBS
01:34:19 recording my screen while I animate
01:34:21 gotcha
01:34:23 while I was looking this over
01:34:25 in the corner because I had one monitor
01:34:27 I was watching fucking t-bat videos
01:34:33 exactly what time stamp it is
01:34:37 I went into
01:34:39 I just talked about this
01:34:41 on my Patreon
01:34:43 my Q&A
01:34:45 I call it a Q&A
01:34:47 it is a Q&A people ask me questions
01:34:49 but it's more of just like a what have I been up to
01:34:51 in behind the scenes
01:34:53 just my personal stuff
01:34:55 talk about shit
01:34:57 podcasting on my
01:34:59 patreon.com I talked about this a bit
01:35:01 more
01:35:03 but I will just say I've been thinking about
01:35:06 I've been thinking about making a video
01:35:08 about Phantom Horn
01:35:10 called thoroughly analyzing Phantom Horn
01:35:12 I think I might make that video
01:35:14 after Phantom's Revenge is done
01:35:16 and just kind of
01:35:18 talk about
01:35:20 the character
01:35:22 and the ideas behind
01:35:24 the ideas he was supposed to embody
01:35:26 and how he succeeded
01:35:28 and how he failed at that and his whole arc
01:35:30 and like what
01:35:32 I don't know
01:35:34 I love Phantom Horn
01:35:36 for being racist
01:35:38 he's totally racist
01:35:40 it's really cool
01:35:42 he's so racist
01:35:44 but he's um
01:35:46 I don't
01:35:48 I don't know if I want to get into it
01:35:50 I have a lot to say
01:35:52 I have a lot to say about like
01:35:54 what his deal is
01:35:56 and what people might have
01:35:58 thought his deal
01:36:00 and what I thought his deal was
01:36:02 because I don't think I fully understood
01:36:04 some of the ideas
01:36:06 I was trying to communicate with Phantom Horn
01:36:08 in the beginning I think
01:36:10 now I can kind of look back and be like
01:36:12 this is what I was trying to do with him
01:36:14 but at the time I was like
01:36:16 kind of like didn't have the
01:36:18 vocabulary I think
01:36:20 because Phantom's flaw
01:36:22 Phantom's fatal flaw is not that he is like
01:36:24 an SJW
01:36:26 like a lot of the jokes about him
01:36:28 in his videos are like
01:36:30 he's such like a tumblerina SJW
01:36:32 but like really that's not
01:36:34 that's not really
01:36:36 the
01:36:38 the
01:36:40 that's over simplification
01:36:42 that's like the surface level
01:36:44 that's the most surface level
01:36:46 critique of Phantom where you could give and there's a lot more to it than that
01:36:48 I was watching
01:36:50 I rewatched
01:36:52 that one video
01:36:54 where we sing
01:36:56 where we did the cover of
01:36:58 and with
01:37:00 with Tommy
01:37:02 and Digi Brony
01:37:04 and An-Y Pony and all them
01:37:06 and I was like
01:37:08 you know An-Y?
01:37:10 I know An-Y I was on his podcast once
01:37:12 oh yeah
01:37:14 I haven't
01:37:16 heard from him in forever and ever
01:37:18 but that's okay
01:37:20 yeah anyway
01:37:22 I just watched that and I was like some of these
01:37:24 what was these jokes about Phantom Horn
01:37:26 are weird the whole
01:37:28 the whole joke here is like is bizarre
01:37:30 and I wouldn't write this today
01:37:32 um
01:37:34 anyway
01:37:36 he's a good boy
01:37:38 I wonder if I've seen that video
01:37:40 is it on the t-bap channel or is it on someone else's channel
01:37:42 yeah it's on the t-bap channel
01:37:44 I think it's um
01:37:46 I think it's part of the cutie mark kerfuffle
01:37:48 series there was gonna be
01:37:50 two there were gonna be
01:37:52 three parts
01:37:54 to the cutie mark kerfuffle
01:37:56 and it was a
01:37:58 it was
01:38:02 I think it was a
01:38:04 we just made a song parody
01:38:06 and then I think later we decided to turn it into a series
01:38:08 and then later we decided
01:38:10 I guess we'll call it the cutie mark kerfuffle series
01:38:12 and it's three videos
01:38:14 it's when we all got our fucking cutie marks
01:38:16 swapped around
01:38:18 and it's just each one is just a song parody
01:38:20 but the third one we kind of just didn't make
01:38:22 it's not like somebody made the song
01:38:24 and I think it's Jesse rapping
01:38:26 I think it's a Jesse like rap
01:38:28 and there's no like animation to
01:38:30 there's I drew one image that kind of
01:38:32 communicates the story of what's going on
01:38:34 it's it's when um
01:38:36 yeah I think it's Anthony C
01:38:38 and Jess and and starboard bow
01:38:40 become alicorn princesses
01:38:42 I think that's what happens in that one
01:38:44 uh
01:38:46 but it never got posted
01:38:48 no it got posted it just
01:38:50 there was just an image
01:38:52 uh the song is there
01:38:54 I think I think this I think that
01:38:56 video that I was just talking about the one where we sing
01:38:58 the song we sing a true true friend
01:39:00 I think it ends with a little teaser where
01:39:02 like Anthony C and Jesse become
01:39:04 alicorn princesses
01:39:06 I see it
01:39:08 wait no wait no everyone's an alicorn
01:39:10 were we
01:39:12 yeah I'm looking at it
01:39:14 everyone's an alicorn
01:39:16 except you because
01:39:18 it's a real horn
01:39:20 oh yeah
01:39:22 who says that the toilet paper
01:39:24 isn't a real horn it's as real as anyone
01:39:26 else's it can magically
01:39:28 wipe your ass that's the one thing it's good for
01:39:30 t-bap
01:39:32 the lost chapters and there's like
01:39:34 what is the secret of mana fucking like
01:39:36 text scroll
01:39:38 I don't even remember this why is it like this
01:39:42 I actually don't think I've seen this
01:39:44 I guess I sort of
01:39:46 the secret of mana text scroll
01:39:48 there's not that much to explain
01:39:50 I guess there is actually
01:39:52 I guess there is
01:39:54 I think I think the text
01:39:56 scroll is just like it explains
01:39:58 like what would have happened in between
01:40:00 like the last video
01:40:02 and this song
01:40:04 I think it's just like here's the context folks
01:40:06 enjoy
01:40:08 I forgot about this
01:40:10 um
01:40:12 this reminds me of
01:40:14 we were gonna we had we had one other song
01:40:16 we had another t-bap video we wanted to
01:40:18 make at the time it was gonna be
01:40:20 it was gonna be like it was gonna be a keg and phantom
01:40:22 sort of like backstory
01:40:24 video just like a song about
01:40:26 them and like what their family is like
01:40:28 and it was gonna be the introduction of
01:40:30 you see their parents
01:40:32 in briefly in the flashback
01:40:34 in phantom reviews heartswarming you
01:40:36 this was gonna be one where they
01:40:38 sing just kind of about their
01:40:40 themselves it would be set to raise
01:40:42 these barn raise this barn but it was
01:40:44 gonna be raise these bros and it was
01:40:46 gonna be about like how much
01:40:48 they annoy their dad
01:40:50 uh it was gonna be great
01:40:52 I think we I think
01:40:54 I
01:40:56 I think we recorded the song actually
01:40:58 I think Nate wrote the lyrics and I think
01:41:00 we recorded the song
01:41:02 but we never actually got around I drew
01:41:04 some some images for it
01:41:06 we just never made it
01:41:08 never finished I say I started
01:41:10 sketching it
01:41:12 that was that was gonna be a good video
01:41:14 that was gonna be a good video but at the time the time has passed
01:41:16 it's like there's there's no need
01:41:18 anymore but still sometimes I think
01:41:20 about it like I would have been good
01:41:22 you know what I mean
01:41:24 I suppose yeah I have
01:41:26 I've got a bunch of videos that like
01:41:28 I wanted to make when I was in
01:41:30 that community but I never got around to
01:41:32 honestly that that feeling
01:41:34 is kind of like dangerous
01:41:36 because it's what
01:41:38 prevented me from making a Five Nights
01:41:40 at Freddy's parody when that was like new
01:41:42 it's what prevented me from like jumping
01:41:44 on a bunch of stuff that was like
01:41:46 hot and fresh because I'm like no I gotta finish
01:41:48 this pony animation first
01:41:50 and then you know
01:41:52 I missed my chance
01:41:54 which
01:41:56 oh god
01:41:58 fuck my back
01:42:00 it's a little painful
01:42:02 wait which what what attitude
01:42:04 is dangerous what what do you mean
01:42:06 the the oh like
01:42:08 for me like I had
01:42:10 all these like pony ideas like ideas for
01:42:12 pony animations that I was like attached to and I wanted
01:42:14 to make all of them
01:42:16 and as a result I ended up like
01:42:18 turning away like opportunities
01:42:20 to do things that could have
01:42:22 been way more profitable and successful
01:42:24 because when a fandom is new
01:42:26 like making an animation
01:42:28 even if it is complete dog shit
01:42:30 quality it'll get like five million views
01:42:32 it doesn't matter
01:42:34 people will just watch it
01:42:36 and like it
01:42:38 and I should have like
01:42:40 you know when Five Nights at Freddy's
01:42:42 was a new thing I had a few ideas for
01:42:44 Five Nights at Freddy's animations but I want to finish
01:42:46 my pony animations first
01:42:48 which took like a year
01:42:50 which which sucks by the time I was
01:42:52 done like like Five Nights at Freddy's
01:42:54 was already so big and like it was
01:42:56 like too late they were already tons and tons
01:42:58 of fan animations exactly it was too late
01:43:00 to jump in and then the standard had risen
01:43:02 and it's not like I was going I was planning
01:43:04 on making like a lazy piece of shit
01:43:06 I would have still made it look good
01:43:08 but of course it's you
01:43:10 I
01:43:12 fucked up and there's been so many points
01:43:14 in my life where I had an opportunity
01:43:16 to do something and I just mucked around
01:43:18 finishing old things that ended up not
01:43:20 being successful and then missing
01:43:22 you know the train to something bigger
01:43:24 which is what I'm trying not to do now
01:43:26 by capitalizing on a meme
01:43:28 immediately when it's popular
01:43:30 instead of waiting around which is what
01:43:32 I'm doing right now
01:43:34 it's what I've been animating during this call
01:43:36 which I can't share
01:43:38 you can't
01:43:40 not with the public
01:43:42 I mean you can look at it and you can
01:43:44 ooh and ah oh yeah please

01:44:46 what the fuck
01:44:48 what the fuck
01:44:50 there you go
01:44:52 that's what I've been animating by the way
01:44:54 wait
01:44:56 well I like it
01:44:58 I like what I'm seeing here
01:45:00 I don't know if I know who this
01:45:02 is
01:45:04 that's my character from the cum zone
01:45:06 video doing the
01:45:08 the Anka
01:45:10 Animal Crossing porn dance meme
01:45:12 thing
01:45:14 oh I'm not familiar with that
01:45:16 I know Anka
01:45:18 okay
01:45:20 there was zone did an animation
01:45:22 of Anka from Animal Crossing
01:45:24 doing a big sex
01:45:26 that was like inspired
01:45:28 by like an old minus 8 animation
01:45:30 and it's
01:45:32 people cropped the sex
01:45:34 and like so that way you couldn't see
01:45:36 the big dick going into her cat pussy
01:45:38 basically
01:45:40 and people thought oh she's dancing
01:45:42 and they turned it into a tiktok dance
01:45:44 not knowing that it was sex
01:45:46 which is fun I mean it's hardly
01:45:48 even a dance
01:45:50 it is hardly a dance
01:45:52 but it's an easy to animate loop
01:45:54 so I'm just fucking going for
01:45:56 a remix for song and everything
01:45:58 my patrons can see this shit
01:46:00 early but you guys
01:46:02 listening to a ptp you can't
01:46:04 I get it for free
01:46:06 yeah Ben gets it for free
01:46:08 as you know we charge all
01:46:10 of our guests to be on the show
01:46:12 so this will come out of
01:46:14 I will reduce your
01:46:16 appearance fee
01:46:18 by
01:46:20 I don't know
01:46:22 Ben saying the inventor of patreon
01:46:24 gets all patreon rewards for free
01:46:26 it's just one of the perks
01:46:28 of being an innovator
01:46:30 the
01:46:32 where you were just describing
01:46:34 alright I'm gonna air
01:46:36 my personal fear
01:46:38 my fear and terror and dread
01:46:40 what you were just describing
01:46:42 about like the
01:46:44 getting caught in like oh I gotta finish my thing
01:46:46 I gotta finish my thing
01:46:48 but then I can't do
01:46:50 some other thing that might be more
01:46:52 that's just like my whole life
01:46:54 that's just my whole life is just
01:46:56 I gotta finish this old thing
01:46:58 that's like
01:47:00 nobody cares I mean I've been working on this
01:47:02 fucking phantom horn game for almost a year
01:47:04 and I know that it's not
01:47:06 like
01:47:08 it's not attached
01:47:10 to anything
01:47:12 I know that it's
01:47:14 based on some old shit that I did
01:47:16 that is like
01:47:18 why are you still doing this
01:47:20 but like I can't that's what I like about it
01:47:22 it's like yeah it's got no
01:47:24 it's not
01:47:26 it's not gonna hit big or anything
01:47:28 it can't
01:47:30 but I just want to
01:47:32 I don't know
01:47:34 fuck it
01:47:36 but I
01:47:38 I guess the stallus I can take
01:47:40 is that I know that
01:47:42 I am wasting my time
01:47:44 doing some nonsense that
01:47:46 will not succeed
01:47:48 or benefit me in any way
01:47:50 will not pay dividends
01:47:52 but on the other hand
01:47:54 I'm not actually losing anything
01:47:56 because if I wasn't doing that
01:47:58 it's not like I would be making good choices
01:48:00 it's not like I would be doing something that was useful
01:48:02 I would just be wasting my time
01:48:04 even worse
01:48:06 I guess you can take comfort in that
01:48:08 absolutely
01:48:10 pass up some good ideas
01:48:12 like fuck
01:48:14 not me
01:48:16 I wanted to like in 2016
01:48:18 I was like you know I kind of want to make
01:48:20 story time like animator videos
01:48:22 I feel like I have a lot to say
01:48:24 like in that sort of style
01:48:26 story time like the
01:48:28 lightly animated like draw my life
01:48:30 kind of thing
01:48:32 like the jaden animations fjord ones out
01:48:34 domics if anyone remembers
01:48:36 that sort of thing
01:48:38 he was like
01:48:40 the og he was doing that shit like
01:48:42 in 2012 2011 or some shit
01:48:44 he was doing it real early
01:48:46 but like I had ideas for like
01:48:48 videos like that I could make
01:48:50 and I was like oh but I've got this project
01:48:52 and that project and this project and that project
01:48:54 and then I saw like a year later
01:48:56 the story time animator scene
01:48:58 blew up a bunch of channels
01:49:00 just like shut up into the millions of subscribers
01:49:04 and then I was like
01:49:06 oh it's too late now fuck
01:49:08 now the market saturated
01:49:10 should have
01:49:12 followed my gut instinct
01:49:14 perhaps I mean it's the
01:49:16 it's the
01:49:18 you know I've known people who were like
01:49:20 I was
01:49:22 this close to investing in bitcoin back in like
01:49:24 2010 like I almost
01:49:26 did it like I thought about doing it
01:49:28 it's kind of like
01:49:30 that I guess like
01:49:32 there was a thing that I thought about doing
01:49:34 I didn't do it
01:49:36 it turned out it would have made
01:49:38 it would have been a huge benefit for me
01:49:40 if I did but
01:49:42 but it didn't so
01:49:44 I was a fool
01:49:46 huh
01:49:48 it was foolish
01:49:52 sure sure
01:49:54 I'm not being a fool anymore
01:49:56 now I'm like I know porn
01:49:58 porn animations
01:50:00 pay very well
01:50:02 on patreon
01:50:04 and
01:50:06 like a lot of artists I follow
01:50:08 I've you know been drawing NSFW
01:50:10 art for like less than a year
01:50:12 now
01:50:14 I've been doing it for like 10 months on and off
01:50:16 and I don't have a whole
01:50:18 lot of followers but I know people with like
01:50:20 10 times my follower account who make less than
01:50:22 me on patreon
01:50:24 like you know you know cake they call
01:50:26 him cake big booby
01:50:28 I do I do know they call him cake
01:50:30 150 on patreon
01:50:32 really
01:50:34 but they're big on twitter
01:50:36 they're huge they've got hundreds of thousands of followers but
01:50:38 they only get like 150 on patreon
01:50:40 why is that
01:50:42 it's a combination of
01:50:44 not like
01:50:46 I think for one they don't draw like explicit stuff
01:50:48 really but also
01:50:50 they don't have
01:50:52 paywall content that I'm aware of
01:50:54 oh well yeah
01:50:56 I guess that makes sense
01:50:58 that does like
01:51:00 you know that does make a huge difference
01:51:02 and also
01:51:04 like people who do animations
01:51:06 like porn animations just make like double or
01:51:08 triple most artists anyway
01:51:10 on average
01:51:12 so whoa
01:51:14 what is this?
01:51:16 hi
01:51:18 are you recording?
01:51:22 did I be late?
01:51:24 yeah
01:51:26 wow
01:51:28 how interesting
01:51:30 are you recording?
01:51:32 okay
01:51:34 you're just in time we just started talking about boobs
01:51:36 like
01:51:38 sort of
01:51:40 sort of
01:51:42 drawing over that
01:51:44 drawing over that now
01:51:48 what?
01:51:50 what?
01:51:52 hey guys welcome to the pro crest news podcast
01:51:54 show's over
01:51:56 goodbye
01:51:58 don't listen to Ben
01:52:00 he's a liar
01:52:02 I'm sorry I lost track of the conversation
01:52:04 you guys are gonna have to carry it for me
01:52:08 well I was just talking about
01:52:10 porn artists
01:52:12 and porn animators and how
01:52:14 being a porn animator makes you lots of money on patreon if you
01:52:16 do it right
01:52:18 I have a big old audience on my youtube channel
01:52:20 so what I need to do
01:52:22 is make
01:52:24 porn animations that are like
01:52:26 covered up in youtube
01:52:28 save and then have
01:52:30 the naughty versions on patreon
01:52:32 I've seen people do that
01:52:34 they've jumped from like
01:52:36 1,000 a month to like 10-20,000 a month
01:52:38 doing that
01:52:40 I've seen a few people do that
01:52:42 I mean that's what Mary does
01:52:44 or I don't know if he does it anymore
01:52:46 he probably does but he would have her
01:52:48 Mary weather
01:52:50 you know him
01:52:52 oh yeah yeah
01:52:54 the internet explorer
01:52:56 comics guy
01:52:58 he's also a vtuber now
01:53:00 yeah you have them on the pcpr number
01:53:02 yes they do
01:53:04 yeah they would have like a comic going
01:53:06 and then they would have you know
01:53:08 if you were a patreon supporter you could get the
01:53:10 the explicit version
01:53:12 not the explicit version
01:53:14 but like an extra panel sometimes
01:53:16 or just like official art
01:53:18 of the NSFW art of the character
01:53:20 they have only
01:53:22 90 patrons
01:53:24 interestingly
01:53:26 at the highest here
01:53:28 25 which
01:53:30 that would only be like 2,000 dollars
01:53:32 it's actually
01:53:34 it's probably a lot lower than that
01:53:36 wait Mary weather only has 90 patrons
01:53:38 yeah Mary weather comics only has 90 patrons
01:53:40 so assuming everyone's a 25 dollar patron
01:53:42 which is unlikely that they'd only be getting 2,000
01:53:44 that's less than I expected
01:53:46 wait a second I'm like
01:53:48 what
01:53:50 okay I was sure
01:53:52 I feel like
01:53:54 it was like 10,000 a month at some point
01:53:56 maybe
01:53:58 am I crazy hold on
01:54:00 maybe you're crazy
01:54:02 also
01:54:04 I just logged into patreon I have 18 notifications
01:54:06 this never happens
01:54:08 I usually have one or two what the fuck happened
01:54:10 why do I have it I'm scared is that everyone
01:54:12 on pledge or did I gain like 20 pledges
01:54:14 have you been putting stuff out
01:54:16 I've been putting stuff out
01:54:18 oh
01:54:20 someone went through and liked all of my posts
01:54:22 oh
01:54:24 what an asshole
01:54:26 what an asshole
01:54:28 thank you
01:54:30 this could have been about money
01:54:32 okay so yeah I got 16 likes
01:54:34 on a bunch of patreon posts
01:54:36 and then two people pledged okay
01:54:38 alright
01:54:40 I was like today's
01:54:42 did something happen
01:54:44 okay that's cool
01:54:46 some
01:54:48 part of me thinks you should take
01:54:50 yourself all more seriously Gib
01:54:52 you should maybe try
01:54:54 to like
01:54:56 have a product that people can get excited for
01:54:58 on patreon.com
01:55:00 gib and take slash patreon
01:55:02 and I don't do it
01:55:06 but I could
01:55:08 the porn stuff I'm not really like good yet
01:55:10 at like
01:55:12 anatomy because that's the most important
01:55:14 well not really
01:55:16 not really the most important but it's very
01:55:18 very helpful for like actually
01:55:20 communicating
01:55:22 a specific look
01:55:24 I mean people can get away with like
01:55:26 drawing the same thing 100 million times
01:55:28 exactly the same every time
01:55:30 and if people like it
01:55:32 then that'll work
01:55:34 but I get bored
01:55:36 I get bored too easily
01:55:38 I have a couple
01:55:40 I have a couple that put patreon notifications
01:55:42 oh my god oh two people pledged to me
01:55:44 oh wow
01:55:46 three people pledged to me
01:55:48 I lost a few patreons at the beginning of the month
01:55:50 but a couple new ones too
01:55:52 so thank you Jacob and Airlock and Roger
01:55:56 I'll tell a few people that
01:55:58 unpatron okay
01:56:00 okay thank you yeah the balance
01:56:02 the balance must remain
01:56:04 the light
01:56:06 and the dark rises to meet it
01:56:08 there must always be a Sith for a Jedi
01:56:12 fuck oh okay
01:56:14 I gotta look at Merryweather's grafter on history
01:56:16 because I'm sure they were making more than that
01:56:18 I gotta look this up
01:56:20 okay
01:56:22 but yeah like my twitter
01:56:24 a big girl squish
01:56:26 which I've mentioned before
01:56:28 is like oh that's the porn one
01:56:30 where I post
01:56:32 not even that much porn
01:56:34 I have these characters
01:56:36 who are like oh cool
01:56:38 sex and stuff
01:56:40 but I've not really done anything with that twitter
01:56:42 I very occasionally have a drawing
01:56:44 and I put it there
01:56:46 and uh
01:56:48 it's really
01:56:50 it's like I'm treating it too much
01:56:52 like a hobby but maybe it is just a hobby
01:56:56 there's a lot of pressure
01:56:58 just from all sides and constantly
01:57:00 to make everything you do content
01:57:02 can't waste content
01:57:04 I can't waste it
01:57:06 what if I could make a
01:57:08 I don't know
01:57:10 some sort of an established following
01:57:12 of people who know what I do
01:57:14 and I could do commissions or something
01:57:16 ah jeez
01:57:18 sheesh
01:57:20 okay I can't find
01:57:22 Merryweather on grafteron
01:57:24 yeah I can't find them either
01:57:26 I'm finding a
01:57:28 someone who looks like a stripper
01:57:30 there's a deleted patreon
01:57:32 for someone called stormy merryweather
01:57:34 who is a porn star
01:57:36 um
01:57:38 I've never encountered this before
01:57:40 I just can't find their grafteron
01:57:42 weird
01:57:44 I use grafteron for the first time
01:57:46 yesterday so it's funny you bring it up
01:57:48 I use grafteron to watch Trixie's
01:57:50 patron, patreon collapse
01:57:52 month
01:57:54 I use it to
01:57:56 I use it to check over
01:57:58 a few like fellow porn
01:58:00 animators to see like
01:58:02 at what time their patron jumped up
01:58:04 I'm doing similar things
01:58:06 to some of them and I'm just trying to figure out
01:58:08 how beneficial
01:58:10 it'll be for me
01:58:12 I only need to earn like 2k
01:58:14 and I can quit my job and then like make
01:58:16 probably about five times as much porn
01:58:18 as I am now
01:58:20 that would be cool
01:58:22 I've seen behind the scenes bits
01:58:24 of you drawing stuff
01:58:26 and I've also seen the public stuff
01:58:28 it is good drawings
01:58:30 wait no
01:58:32 I make more than you on patreon
01:58:34 if you start
01:58:36 making porn animations
01:58:38 you might pass me
01:58:40 and I don't want that so
01:58:42 I have to stop you at any cost
01:58:44 we can't release this episode
01:58:46 but if I surpass you
01:58:48 you have to delete your patreon in shame
01:58:50 that's for rules
01:58:52 what if I
01:58:54 what if I
01:58:56 okay
01:58:58 what if I patron you now
01:59:00 but if you pass me in patreon
01:59:02 you have to patron me
01:59:04 I say this knowing that you definitely will
01:59:06 your plan is full proof
01:59:08 and it definitely will work
01:59:10 so I'm gonna have to like how can I negotiate you
01:59:12 into an unlinable deal
01:59:14 here's the thing Ben
01:59:16 that is actually the moral thing to do
01:59:18 if your friend is earning way more than you on patreon
01:59:20 it's foolish for you to pledge the same amount
01:59:22 to both pledge each other at the same time
01:59:24 because you're just exchanging the same coin
01:59:26 and patreon's taking a cut
01:59:28 only the bigger person should pledge to the smaller person
01:59:30 I feel like that is
01:59:32 what should happen also
01:59:34 even if I like someone's content
01:59:36 I generally don't pledge to them
01:59:38 if they make more than me
01:59:40 because like why
01:59:42 you're doing fine
01:59:44 I say that yet I still pledge teleperte on occasion
01:59:46 even though we're friends
01:59:48 I might
01:59:50 he does just give me his shit for free
01:59:52 yeah
01:59:54 who am I a patron of
01:59:56 I am a patron of
02:00:00 I think I pledged to you Gib
02:00:02 I think I pledged to
02:00:04 for a while I was a patron of Japanese emoticons.com
02:00:06 just because I used it all the time
02:00:08 I pledged them $1 a month
02:00:10 and then I was like why am I still doing this
02:00:14 my creators
02:00:16 literally where do I
02:00:18 find who I'm pledged to
02:00:20 I can't fucking find it
02:00:22 oh there's more tears on
02:00:24 Mary with this thing
02:00:26 oh there are more tears
02:00:28 oh there's five levels
02:00:30 oh I didn't see that
02:00:32 oh wait I still support DeVoo
02:00:34 I don't know why
02:00:36 okay DeVoo changed their thing
02:00:38 I pledged a dollar to DeVoo
02:00:40 but it was per game
02:00:42 now it has changed to per month
02:00:44 and I think I'm gonna unplug
02:00:46 cause I don't want to do that
02:00:48 oh live on the PCP Ben
02:00:50 I think I'm gonna unplug DeVoo
02:00:52 yeah I'm gonna do it
02:00:54 just stab in the back
02:00:56 well I mean it's
02:00:58 money you do what you want with it
02:01:00 I will
02:01:02 I usually like to
02:01:04 like for Autominus
02:01:06 the soundtrack was like the way
02:01:08 yeah
02:01:10 so I bought that and that was good
02:01:12 oh I'm a ShadOx
02:01:14 patron I'm a pledge to ShadOx
02:01:16 after the RFCK animation
02:01:18 I was like I didn't mean
02:01:20 I gotta pledge to that
02:01:22 gotta pluge
02:01:24 gotta pluge
02:01:26 ShadOx is only
02:01:28 per episode
02:01:30 so like god I mean I could
02:01:32 for an episode of LoveWeb I feel like
02:01:34 it's worth more than $5
02:01:36 I might increase that
02:01:38 per month
02:01:40 I would be $5
02:01:42 but per episode I'm like I should be like
02:01:44 $100 per episode honestly
02:01:46 that shit
02:01:48 that shit is wild
02:01:50 I'm also pledged to
02:01:52 I'm pledged to Cheesy Manfredo
02:01:54 and I'm pledged to Gabriel the Starman
02:01:56 a few dollars a month
02:01:58 what's Gabriel's
02:02:00 is that a twitch thing
02:02:02 do you know them?
02:02:04 yeah Gabriel from RFCK
02:02:06 and also just in general
02:02:08 I saw them at Brighton
02:02:12 I mean they're an artist
02:02:14 although I can't
02:02:16 I don't know if they've posted anything
02:02:18 I'm not sure if they
02:02:20 they take their Patreon down
02:02:22 I mean I haven't
02:02:24 I haven't seen them draw in a while
02:02:26 but they have been like streaming with a funny
02:02:28 monkey vtuber
02:02:30 oh I haven't seen that
02:02:32 they made a Patreon a while ago and I pledged to it
02:02:34 that might be a secret
02:02:36 I haven't said that
02:02:38 oh dear
02:02:40 never mind
02:02:42 I didn't say exactly what it was
02:02:44 I think they may have
02:02:46 taken their Patreon page down
02:02:48 but I'm still pledged to them
02:02:50 maybe I should try
02:02:52 Patreon's just stealing it
02:02:54 stealing it all
02:02:56 that would be unfortunate
02:02:58 but that is something they would do
02:03:00 well this has been
02:03:02 a revelation
02:03:04 for me this has been
02:03:06 I've learned some things that I
02:03:08 feel damaged
02:03:10 to know
02:03:12 wow
02:03:16 a loveless episode of
02:03:18 the money cast
02:03:20 bonus next bonus
02:03:22 idea for the bonus episode
02:03:24 we just watch
02:03:26 the price of Bitcoin rise and fall in real time
02:03:28 and we go oh it went up like 30 cents
02:03:30 you have to modulate
02:03:32 the pitch of your voice to match the direction
02:03:34 it's going oh it's going up
02:03:36 oh no
02:03:38 oh no the candle's red
02:03:40 oh no the candle's red
02:03:42 oh my god the hammer's green
02:03:44 oh there it goes
02:03:46 you know if we had someone
02:03:48 smart
02:03:50 because I know that data is archived
02:03:52 you could have someone run a literal
02:03:54 pitch changer
02:03:56 in real time that follows the graph
02:03:58 we send in our audio
02:04:00 and we run through the script
02:04:02 I have no doubt in my mind that crack could do that
02:04:04 I have no doubt in my mind
02:04:06 that he could create something that
02:04:08 dynamically reacts to the market
02:04:10 that would be like what makes it worth listening to
02:04:14 maybe
02:04:16 maybe if you could do it to just Ben's audio
02:04:18 and then I would just be there to sigh
02:04:20 every so often
02:04:22 in normal pitch
02:04:24 hey speaking of the bonus episodes
02:04:26 let me ask you something
02:04:28 what if
02:04:30 what if I were to call you
02:04:32 how would you feel
02:04:34 what if I said
02:04:36 hey you know what oblivion fall
02:04:38 you're a fucking gay wizard
02:04:40 not only that
02:04:42 but you're a bottom
02:04:44 you're a bottom gay wizard and you probably
02:04:46 either are or are friends with
02:04:48 at least one sorcerer
02:04:50 what would you say to that
02:04:54 choose your words carelessly
02:04:56 choose your words yes
02:04:58 if you have a big penis
02:05:00 put it in my ass
02:05:02 please
02:05:04 oh my god he admit it
02:05:06 oh my god he admit it
02:05:08 it's just a hypothetical you didn't have to admit it
02:05:10 ergy ergy ergy
02:05:12 no this I'm using your platform to solicit sex
02:05:14 from the audience
02:05:16 well shit that's what we're supposed to do
02:05:18 you're not allowed to do that
02:05:20 well I gotta say
02:05:22 I gotta say
02:05:24 that's not
02:05:26 that's not what I was expecting
02:05:28 I was gonna
02:05:30 that's a hell of an answer
02:05:32 if you want to understand the ramifications of what just transpired
02:05:34 you're gonna have to be a patron
02:05:36 and watch the latest bonus episode
02:05:38 which should be out by now
02:05:40 for context into what the fuck I'm talking about
02:05:42 see I designed it like this so there'd be FOMO
02:05:44 so people wouldn't get the joke
02:05:46 if they don't know
02:05:48 FOMO is a moral good
02:05:50 I can't remember the joke I don't remember
02:05:52 I can't remember this
02:05:54 I can't like egg you on
02:05:56 with like specifics
02:05:58 I just know that there's a thing
02:06:00 and it's funny
02:06:02 I remember it but I don't know how to say it
02:06:04 if you want that's the only way to know
02:06:06 I'm gonna keep asking
02:06:08 guests until one of them gives the correct answer
02:06:10 the correct response
02:06:12 to that and see how long it takes
02:06:14 give can't egg you on
02:06:16 but perhaps give can most of an egg
02:06:18 you on
02:06:22 I'm just gonna say
02:06:24 things are not gonna go well
02:06:26 things are not gonna go well for you
02:06:28 if that's what you have to say
02:06:30 about the gay wizard thing
02:06:32 wrong answer
02:06:34 buzzer
02:06:36 that was a terrible attempt at a
02:06:38 buzzer sound
02:06:40 much better
02:06:44 okay do you guys have any
02:06:46 any more issues to raise
02:06:48 I got a thing
02:06:50 to talk about
02:06:52 so this is October
02:06:54 wow
02:06:56 clearly
02:06:58 oh my god it's spooky season
02:07:00 oh my god it's apple pumpkin
02:07:02 it's apple pumpkin spice time
02:07:04 oh my god
02:07:06 sweater weather
02:07:08 it's time to get all the cowboy paraphernalia out
02:07:10 cause it's wild west month
02:07:12 which is why
02:07:14 I'm getting
02:07:16 the Clarissa Gunsmoke comic
02:07:18 finally out into the public eye
02:07:20 all nice and dolled up
02:07:22 and polished
02:07:24 and I've been drawing
02:07:26 not really like draw
02:07:28 I've been like touching up a few panels here and there
02:07:30 where this line work is really sloppy
02:07:32 but mostly just
02:07:34 adding like tone
02:07:36 to the hair and some other things in the shading
02:07:38 so it's like the hot summer
02:07:40 sun of the wild west desert
02:07:42 beating down and it feels
02:07:44 way better than it was
02:07:46 before
02:07:48 and redoing a lot of the dialogue
02:07:50 cause it was cringe before and it sucked
02:07:52 of course
02:07:54 most importantly I'm reorienting it
02:07:56 reorienting it from
02:07:58 Japanese to western
02:08:00 left to right reading
02:08:02 which is harder than it
02:08:04 looked
02:08:06 harder than it feels
02:08:08 cause it's like you can't just
02:08:10 flip the page because then
02:08:12 the panel
02:08:14 the panels that you would read
02:08:16 would be the wrong way around
02:08:18 and like the characters would be looking in the wrong direction
02:08:20 if you want like the flow
02:08:22 of visual
02:08:24 stimulus and the speech bubbles
02:08:26 have to shift so that they actually
02:08:28 also within a panel
02:08:30 are left to right reading
02:08:32 but yeah
02:08:34 it's a whole lot of stuff
02:08:36 the first chapter is gonna be about 20 pages
02:08:38 gonna be posted on my website
02:08:40 gibandtake.site
02:08:42 so if you're gonna put it on twitter
02:08:44 it'll be buried in twitter
02:08:46 but people will see it and be like
02:08:48 oh I guess I go check out the website
02:08:50 and yeah
02:08:52 that Clarissa Gunsmoke Month
02:08:54 finally
02:08:56 are you gonna finish
02:08:58 the comic like is it gonna get
02:09:00 completed?
02:09:02 I don't expect that
02:09:04 I will have the time to finish
02:09:06 cause
02:09:08 there's a lot of stuff that happens
02:09:10 after the end of what I had already drawn
02:09:12 but there's 50 pages
02:09:14 there's enough for three
02:09:16 sort of medium-sized chapters
02:09:18 and
02:09:20 I'll think about
02:09:22 how I can finish it later
02:09:24 but I think as soon as I'm done with that
02:09:26 I'll be
02:09:28 more focused on the Lord of Ghost
02:09:30 Kickstarter backer reward
02:09:32 mailing stuff
02:09:34 and then after that I could probably start drawing
02:09:36 maybe even go back to
02:09:38 streaming the draw streams
02:09:40 with those
02:09:42 I mentioned this before
02:09:44 but I have spent
02:09:46 the last two days working on
02:09:48 this page
02:09:50 of the Lord of Ghosts
02:09:52 comic that I'm working on
02:09:54 it has been
02:09:56 I accidentally deleted
02:09:58 my sketch of it so I had to
02:10:00 recreate the sketch and then I have been
02:10:02 there's just a lot of layers
02:10:04 there's like
02:10:06 there's like 50 layers
02:10:08 on this
02:10:10 one page
02:10:12 on one page
02:10:14 there's a lot
02:10:16 happening in this one
02:10:18 it's good
02:10:20 I'm excited
02:10:22 you're gonna like it
02:10:24 maybe when you see it
02:10:26 you can guess which one
02:10:28 God I hope this is the page that takes me the longest
02:10:30 I'm hoping not the other pages don't take
02:10:32 so
02:10:34 I'm
02:10:36 a little sick of looking at it honestly
02:10:38 I've had enough but
02:10:40 it's almost done
02:10:42 this is page 4
02:10:44 this is page 4 of 9 that I am
02:10:46 holy shit
02:10:48 I know
02:10:50 the other ones weren't as bad
02:10:52 yeah
02:10:54 I'll get it done
02:10:56 pretty soon
02:11:00 we could go to voicemails
02:11:02 I wanted
02:11:04 I did want to mention one thing
02:11:06 about Clarissa
02:11:08 yeah
02:11:10 she is a tall sexy woman
02:11:12 which is good
02:11:14 something I never forgot
02:11:16 Gib
02:11:18 I don't know if this is when you first revealed her
02:11:20 it was like a post you did with her
02:11:22 a long time ago you said she'll root ya
02:11:24 to ya then shoot ya
02:11:26 which hell yeah
02:11:28 the way I imagine that
02:11:30 was like
02:11:32 moan bark fart but instead it's
02:11:34 because root means sex
02:11:36 wait
02:11:38 I don't know if that's it
02:11:40 what was the thing you said the moan
02:11:42 bark fart
02:11:44 you know moan bark fart
02:11:46 no
02:11:48 no
02:11:50 nates mentioned it on the podcast before
02:11:52 oh
02:11:54 moan boat
02:11:56 wait
02:11:58 that was a sound thing
02:12:00 okay I thought it was like a weird
02:12:02 moan bark fart
02:12:04 and then you bark
02:12:06 this is like a very specific
02:12:08 furry sex
02:12:10 fetish
02:12:12 order of operations
02:12:14 it's just an order of sound effects
02:12:16 cause root
02:12:18 is slang for sex
02:12:20 so I figured with calisher
02:12:22 it would be moan
02:12:24 moan
02:12:26 moan for
02:12:28 root to shoot
02:12:30 yeah I get it
02:12:32 I need to make an animation of that at some point
02:12:34 oh please do
02:12:36 that's technically fan art
02:12:38 and I love that
02:12:40 anyway
02:12:42 I pog all over the fan art
02:12:44 everyone's gonna love this conversation
02:12:46 cause the sound effects aren't gonna be in my
02:12:48 recording
02:12:50 oh so we can hear them
02:12:52 but your microphone can't
02:12:54 maybe
02:12:56 I'll make the sound effect for
02:12:58 Eleazar and he can put it in
02:13:00 moan boat
02:13:02 that I can't say
02:13:04 it's not boat
02:13:06 it's bark
02:13:08 what does moan boat
02:13:10 fart even mean
02:13:12 no it's like moan boat
02:13:14 I switched
02:13:16 some letters
02:13:18 to your own boat
02:13:20 and you're like
02:13:22 oh
02:13:28 I had to go
02:13:30 I was too hungry I had to go get some baby bells
02:13:32 but I'm back
02:13:34 baby bells
02:13:36 back and chatter than ever
02:13:38 oh cheese
02:13:40 yeah cheese
02:13:42 the little red
02:13:44 wax circles
02:13:46 oh the little wheels
02:13:48 I have had those
02:13:50 to go on crackers
02:13:52 you should get a greater bell
02:13:54 I'm happy to do voicemails
02:13:56 if you guys are
02:13:58 yeah I guess I didn't really have much to say
02:14:00 about the clear so just
02:14:02 be excited
02:14:04 you idiots and enjoy it
02:14:06 so it's going on your website
02:14:08 right it's going on gibbentake.site
02:14:10 it's gonna go on gibbentake.site
02:14:12 I guess I could maybe do a webtoon
02:14:14 or a tapas or both I don't know
02:14:16 I don't care about those sites they suck
02:14:18 I hate them
02:14:20 you know what I'll read it
02:14:22 I'll finally read it
02:14:24 oh yeah that's the point
02:14:26 that is the point
02:14:28 I hadn't read it because it was technically
02:14:30 complete but like no I'll read it
02:14:32 finally when it goes on the website
02:14:34 because otherwise I don't want to hunt it down
02:14:36 yes
02:14:40 that'll yeah
02:14:42 it'll be good
02:14:44 had you posted it anywhere before
02:14:46 it was up on the artstreet.com
02:14:48 which is the
02:14:50 medibang paint
02:14:52 like
02:14:54 artist area
02:14:56 like a deviant art kind of or a pixiv
02:14:58 where you can post comics and illustrations
02:15:00 and I put it there
02:15:02 uploaded for the contest
02:15:04 and then I put like a price tag on it
02:15:06 so people could
02:15:08 pay 7
02:15:10 no 420 yen
02:15:12 to see
02:15:14 like
02:15:16 I think the whole thing
02:15:18 and there was a preview of a few pages
02:15:20 but yeah it's been up
02:15:22 I think
02:15:24 but it's the one
02:15:26 that version is going to be
02:15:28 outdated it's going to be ruined
02:15:30 I'll leave it there
02:15:32 wait are you doing
02:15:34 are you remastering it
02:15:36 I'm only remastering it
02:15:38 in the sense that I'm
02:15:40 making it look good
02:15:42 because before
02:15:44 the contest was over
02:15:46 I was like oh shit I don't have time
02:15:48 to like make it
02:15:50 do shading and stuff
02:15:52 because I wanted that
02:15:54 and I started for the first 3 pages and I was like
02:15:56 nah I don't have time
02:15:58 I'm just going to post it
02:16:00 and then I just didn't get around to shading it
02:16:02 for an entire year and a month
02:16:04 I see
02:16:06 sure
02:16:08 okay sick
02:16:10 let's do
02:16:12 let's do a voicemail
02:16:14 here
02:16:16 let's do
02:16:18 shit where did I
02:16:20 it's the 3rd
02:16:22 of October
02:16:24 and the first
02:16:26 voicemail
02:16:28 why are these all out of order
02:16:30 what the fuck
02:16:32 oh I briefly should mention
02:16:34 I'm doing
02:16:36 a voicemail
02:16:38 I should mention
02:16:40 I'm doing
02:16:42 a whatever tober
02:16:44 which is a drawing challenge
02:16:46 is what you draw whatever
02:16:48 whenever
02:16:50 in October it's a really great system
02:16:52 because you can't fail
02:16:54 perfect
02:16:56 why didn't anyone think of this
02:16:58 I was trying to do prompts
02:17:00 prompts annoy me
02:17:02 everything is the same
02:17:04 oh was it chip chip
02:17:06 she was drawing
02:17:08 a character in a different status effect
02:17:10 affecting them
02:17:12 I thought that was fun
02:17:14 I like video games
02:17:16 it's neat enough
02:17:18 it's the sort of thing that
02:17:20 once I see other people doing it
02:17:22 why would I do it
02:17:24 why would I also do that
02:17:26 just do whatever
02:17:28 I mean sure
02:17:30 the first 3 voicemails
02:17:32 are not voicemails
02:17:34 which relate to me personally
02:17:36 in the form of the names of the voicemails
02:17:38 the voicemails are called
02:17:40 Ben Delta Rune
02:17:42 literally has the characters jump into
02:17:44 one out of question mark
02:17:46 and then the second voicemail is called
02:17:48 another world and use RPG mechanics
02:17:50 to fight enemies
02:17:52 2 out of question mark
02:17:54 and then the third voicemail is
02:17:56 they explain to Noelle
02:17:58 how RPG battles work
02:18:00 it's isekai
02:18:02 so those are the first 3 voicemails
02:18:04 they have no content other than the title
02:18:06 and I just gotta say
02:18:08 yeah I know Delta Rune isn't isekai
02:18:10 obviously Delta Rune is
02:18:12 like the most obvious isekai
02:18:14 veils are
02:18:16 isekai purity chart
02:18:18 which I will post here
02:18:20 that I retweeted on the twitter account
02:18:22 yeah that was a good one
02:18:24 it is a good one
02:18:26 Delta Rune is it's like most
02:18:28 I think it's most pure
02:18:30 isekai
02:18:32 that is not Japanese I guess
02:18:34 the super pure
02:18:36 is that it has to be from Japan
02:18:38 anime
02:18:40 it doesn't have to be from Japan
02:18:42 and then the lowest one is
02:18:44 it doesn't have to be from any medium in fact
02:18:46 or it can be from any medium
02:18:48 it doesn't need to be from the heart
02:18:50 medium again
02:18:52 colonialism isn't isekai
02:18:54 tripping on acid isn't isekai
02:18:56 true
02:18:58 there was this other isekai chart
02:19:00 that went up
02:19:02 the same day
02:19:04 as that PCP episode
02:19:06 but they didn't credit the PCP
02:19:08 if they ought to be
02:19:10 shot in the back of a head
02:19:12 they ought to be lambasted
02:19:14 they ought to be shot
02:19:16 wait was it you
02:19:18 I didn't say that
02:19:20 YouTube would not support terrorism
02:19:22 how did you fucking do this
02:19:24 I support terrorism
02:19:26 I once said 9-11 out loud
02:19:28 and they killed me for it
02:19:30 they shut down my channel
02:19:32 wait is this you
02:19:34 are you this vtuber
02:19:36 no that was just some person
02:19:38 no not you
02:19:40 wait I thought that
02:19:42 I'm not talking to you
02:19:44 who are you talking to
02:19:46 you you oblivion
02:19:48 I'm not this vtuber
02:19:50 this is just some guy
02:19:52 or girl I don't know
02:19:54 after the PCP episode went up
02:19:56 where you were talking about isekai alignment charts
02:19:58 like 10 hours after the episode went live
02:20:00 this person posted this chart
02:20:02 and didn't credit the PCP
02:20:04 how bad of them
02:20:06 this is
02:20:08 it's not even a good chart which is annoying
02:20:14 no I think it's a good chart
02:20:16 I think the moon landings is a good entry
02:20:18 moon landing is pretty good
02:20:20 but like I don't know
02:20:22 the way
02:20:24 just fails is better
02:20:26 the descriptions are better
02:20:28 the examples are better
02:20:30 I actually
02:20:32 I kind of think the examples are better in this one
02:20:34 I kind of like
02:20:36 like to me
02:20:38 there's not enough meaningful difference
02:20:40 in the medium rebel
02:20:42 row the haley's comment
02:20:44 colonialism and tripping on acid
02:20:46 are both questionably isekai
02:20:48 but they're all in the same way
02:20:50 they're all just like a real thing that happened
02:20:52 whereas
02:20:54 function radical on this one
02:20:56 your name kory in the house
02:20:58 and entering a taco bell
02:21:00 those are all not isekai
02:21:02 but they're not isekai in different ways
02:21:04 because one is an anime
02:21:06 it's just not about going to another world
02:21:08 really
02:21:10 kory in the house is also not about that
02:21:12 but it's a show and then entering a taco bell
02:21:14 is just a thing that you do in real life
02:21:16 so
02:21:18 wait is this like rotated 90 degrees
02:21:20 compared to
02:21:22 yeah no it is
02:21:24 in this one
02:21:26 all
02:21:28 the form
02:21:30 is in the column
02:21:32 but then it veils it's like the top row
02:21:34 the medium purist
02:21:36 I guess the axes are different
02:21:42 we could dissect this
02:21:44 scholars will debate
02:21:46 which of these two isekai alignment charts
02:21:48 is more
02:21:50 is more scientifically
02:21:52 accurate
02:21:54 I kind of prefer the bottom one
02:21:56 but I do hold
02:21:58 great malice towards them for not
02:22:00 crediting the pcp for the idea
02:22:02 you know
02:22:04 do you actually think that they got it from us
02:22:06 I assume
02:22:08 unless that
02:22:10 could it just be a weird coincidence
02:22:12 the discussion in the episode sounded
02:22:14 pretty like spontaneous
02:22:16 it didn't sound like you were referencing an existing meme
02:22:18 unless you were
02:22:20 I'm just wondering
02:22:22 do you think this person actually got the idea
02:22:24 or could it just be a weird coincidence
02:22:26 it was like 10 hours or so
02:22:28 after the episode
02:22:30 that would be a pretty big coincidence
02:22:32 I would say the myth of Plato's cave
02:22:34 in the top 10
02:22:36 that's a good one
02:22:38 that is a good one
02:22:40 that's a good example
02:22:42 Cory in the house
02:22:44 something about Cory in the house being
02:22:46 that's a tired meme
02:22:48 what is this 2012
02:22:50 what is this 2001
02:22:52 it works though
02:22:54 it does but I don't know
02:22:56 I like examples that are
02:22:58 not overdone
02:23:02 I mean they could have used
02:23:04 literally any show
02:23:06 about
02:23:08 well
02:23:10 any show whose premise is about someone goes
02:23:12 somewhere which is like most shows
02:23:14 Golden Girls
02:23:16 is an isekai because it's about
02:23:18 entering the metaphorically different world of being old
02:23:24 it doesn't exist
02:23:26 what
02:23:28 yes it does exist because Dorothy
02:23:30 had chronic fatigue and the doctors told her
02:23:32 she was just a dumb woman and she didn't understand what her body was saying
02:23:36 and then she told that doctor off in the restaurant
02:23:38 and she said he was bad at his job
02:23:40 and he should be ashamed of himself
02:23:42 being old was invented by like M. Night Shyamalan
02:23:44 like less than a month ago
02:23:48 it's like what
02:23:50 it's like
02:23:52 Carl Pilkington said why don't they just
02:23:54 invent a pill
02:23:56 that when you get old instead of dying
02:23:58 you just start aging in reverse again
02:24:00 until you become a baby and then you disappear
02:24:02 why don't they just invent that
02:24:04 why haven't they made this happen yet
02:24:08 the man's keeping us down
02:24:10 the man
02:24:12 makes a good point
02:24:14 I'm looking at the
02:24:16 second isekai, sorry I'm still on this
02:24:18 like the function
02:24:20 purest on the second one
02:24:22 isekai is to travel what is a clearly
02:24:24 a separate reality and then neutral
02:24:26 can be traveled to what can be
02:24:28 physically described as another world
02:24:30 but then radical is like can be
02:24:32 traveled to metaphorically different world
02:24:34 are they
02:24:36 very similar those
02:24:40 like how is the matrix
02:24:42 not a purest
02:24:44 I guess
02:24:46 I guess it's not magic
02:24:48 cause it's like
02:24:50 it's not exactly a world
02:24:52 it's a simulation
02:24:54 he's still in the real world
02:24:56 he's just experiencing a
02:24:58 yeah that one is
02:25:00 like that one is like
02:25:02 it is
02:25:04 in every functional way to the story
02:25:06 it is about like going between
02:25:08 from one world to another
02:25:10 it's just it's
02:25:12 yeah I think I agree with you that's like too close
02:25:14 and then the wizard of us
02:25:16 being like more pure
02:25:18 is strange cause that was a dream
02:25:20 oh yeah I guess it was a dream
02:25:22 was it even a physical different world
02:25:24 yeah you know what
02:25:26 you're right
02:25:28 they're the same in every meaningful way
02:25:32 wizard of us is the matrix
02:25:34 I think we need to
02:25:36 but just without computer it just is
02:25:38 it just is
02:25:40 it's just the same story
02:25:42 that's what we need to part of the world
02:25:48 let's listen to a voicemail
02:25:50 shall we?
02:25:52 let's do it
02:25:54 the first voicemail after that is called
02:25:56 cliché
02:25:58 I won't
02:26:00 wait can I post it in the
02:26:02 okay it's called cliché
02:26:04 three two one go
02:26:06 but I'm just of
02:26:08 more like
02:26:10 but I'm just of
02:26:12 okay
02:26:14 I get it
02:26:16 hold on it's coming out my
02:26:18 negotiations is a word that I learned from watching
02:26:20 star wars for phantom menace as a kid
02:26:22 yeah
02:26:24 whenever I heard my parents say
02:26:26 the word negotiation
02:26:28 that's the star wars word
02:26:30 when do they say that
02:26:32 when the trade federation is talking to
02:26:34 we have to have our negotiations with the trade federation
02:26:36 we have to have the negotiations
02:26:38 we've got to negotiate a trade deal
02:26:40 to get the blockhead out of
02:26:42 fucking
02:26:44 Naboo
02:26:46 it's a funny story
02:26:48 you're really do
02:26:50 you're like negotiation
02:26:52 just like a Shakespeare
02:26:56 okay
02:26:58 setting default audio to
02:27:00 wireless headphones okay good
02:27:02 wait I don't mean
02:27:04 I don't mean to derail
02:27:06 go derail away
02:27:08 on the topic of George Lucas
02:27:10 have you seen the video
02:27:12 there's just a guy walking through the street talking about some shit
02:27:14 and George Lucas just appears
02:27:16 in the background
02:27:18 and just
02:27:20 making music plays
02:27:22 I have to
02:27:24 is it just someone was vlogging
02:27:26 and George Lucas just happened to be there
02:27:28 and he just walks into a building
02:27:30 that's great
02:27:32 I can't believe that George Lucas
02:27:34 actually walks around in the real world
02:27:36 that's so fucked up
02:27:38 it shouldn't be allowed
02:27:40 it's kind of nice
02:27:42 because I feel like George Lucas
02:27:44 lives in a real place
02:27:46 more so than other celebrities
02:27:48 which you only see them
02:27:50 never
02:27:52 only out of a limo
02:27:54 he's got that Skywalker ranch doesn't he
02:27:56 yeah they say that he lives on like his personal
02:27:58 little ranch
02:28:00 he's super rich
02:28:02 I've heard that he's kind of like a recluse
02:28:04 or I mean red letter media called him a recluse once
02:28:06 and I just assume they know what they're talking about
02:28:08 I thought he's been like seen just
02:28:10 eating salad in a food court
02:28:12 oh yeah enjoy your salad
02:28:14 yeah I remember the food court
02:28:16 thing
02:28:18 another thing red letter media made fun of him for
02:28:20 but like why
02:28:22 why make fun of him for eating the food court
02:28:24 what's wrong with that
02:28:26 let's react to this video
02:28:28 PCP of a reaction channel
02:28:30 where we react to voicemails and funny videos
02:28:32 okay here we go
02:28:34 three two one go
02:28:36 right
02:28:38 and they use something they call pyro processing
02:28:40 the interesting thing is
02:28:42 they call it pyro processing
02:28:44 it's a molten salt process
02:28:46 they're dissolving this thing
02:28:48 in a molten salt
02:28:50 and they're doing electro chemistry
02:28:52 it looks just like him
02:28:54 yeah I think it's him
02:28:56 because then it brings up another superior thing
02:28:58 molten salt
02:29:00 oh it is
02:29:02 it's
02:29:04 that's so similar to his face
02:29:06 I'm looking at his face
02:29:08 and now I'm not 100% sure
02:29:10 I wasn't sure until I full screened
02:29:12 it looks more like it than
02:29:14 well
02:29:16 oh no there's a frame where it looks
02:29:18 like someone else
02:29:20 who knows maybe it's just a
02:29:22 classic outfit
02:29:24 he just looks like a regular old man
02:29:26 so like
02:29:28 I really thought it was at first
02:29:30 but now I'm like it could be
02:29:32 just someone who kinda looks similar
02:29:34 and I think it's him
02:29:36 very funny
02:29:38 I don't know what the salt processing
02:29:40 molten, shut the fuck up
02:29:42 fucking egg head
02:29:44 get out of here
02:29:46 regardless of George Lucas
02:29:48 it's funny how he just sort of jumps
02:29:50 into frame like he's like supposed to be there
02:29:52 because he wanted to see this happening
02:29:54 and then he's like oh I guess he's filming
02:29:56 he didn't just walk by casually
02:29:58 he jumped into frame looking at the camera
02:30:00 like uh and then he just
02:30:02 walked all the way across the screen
02:30:04 but in a way that maximized his
02:30:06 screen time
02:30:08 he did it's like he's staying
02:30:10 maybe he had he like
02:30:12 maybe he like knew he had to walk by
02:30:14 and saw that the guy was filming
02:30:16 and he was like I kinda don't want to
02:30:18 walk through this line of film but like I have to
02:30:20 so he tried to like
02:30:22 I don't know it looked like he
02:30:24 he didn't like that he was on camera I think
02:30:26 he was trying to ignore it
02:30:28 he looks like a man who's seen a camera or two
02:30:30 you could say
02:30:32 you could proof perhaps
02:30:34 perhaps
02:30:36 the other smell which I have right here
02:30:38 is called heartfelt dondas
02:30:40 ready
02:30:42 three two one go
02:30:44 donda
02:30:46 donda
02:30:48 donda
02:30:50 donda
02:30:52 I don't know if you have to listen to all 30 seconds of this
02:30:54 donda donda
02:30:56 donda donda
02:30:58 donda donda donda
02:31:00 I don't know what it means
02:31:02 donda donda donda
02:31:04 donda donda donda
02:31:06 donda
02:31:08 I mean I believe it
02:31:10 I believe it too
02:31:12 donda
02:31:14 this is definitely George Lucas
02:31:16 this one I have no doubt about
02:31:18 this is George Lucas having sex dude
02:31:20 that's the noise in a minute
02:31:22 yeah
02:31:24 that's so heartfelt dondas
02:31:26 I was thinking of that fucking turtle
02:31:28 having sex video with the shoe
02:31:30 I was thinking of that
02:31:32 I said it's donda
02:31:36 next one is called
02:31:38 L2 bait
02:31:40 spot scrubs
02:31:42 three two one
02:31:44 go
02:31:46 yeah this whole
02:31:48 general strike thing
02:31:50 striking for one day
02:31:52 smells like bait
02:31:54 that's not how strikes
02:31:56 fucking work guys
02:31:58 I wasn't sure about it
02:32:00 but it's not the easiest bait to get a bunch of
02:32:02 dipshit baby leftists
02:32:04 fired
02:32:06 don't fall for it
02:32:08 I mean do you
02:32:10 I get that it doesn't seem like it's going to do anything
02:32:12 but like
02:32:14 is anyone really going to get fired over it
02:32:16 is anything even going to
02:32:18 if it seems like such a
02:32:20 you would never see the fruits
02:32:22 if your goal is like haha I will put out a plan
02:32:24 that will get a bunch of stupid baby leftists fired
02:32:26 that will get a few people fired
02:32:28 I have never met
02:32:30 but maybe vaguely have a sense that I don't like them
02:32:32 and in my heart I will know that haha
02:32:34 maybe a few of them got fired
02:32:36 because they fell for my trick
02:32:38 I guess that's something people would do
02:32:40 there are people in the world who are that cruel
02:32:42 I guess that's probably true
02:32:44 there are other Ben Saints out there
02:32:46 no no
02:32:48 I cornered the market
02:32:52 damn it well I need I guess I need a new
02:32:54 shtick cruelty is taken
02:32:58 next voicemail is called
02:33:00 will ben have cake
02:33:02 3 2 1 go
02:33:04 you will never have any cake
02:33:06 you will never have any cake
02:33:08 you will never have any cake
02:33:10 you will never have any cake
02:33:12 you will never have any cake
02:33:16 and then the delta rune logo appears
02:33:18 sounds like you answered your own question there
02:33:20 buddy
02:33:24 I'm sorry
02:33:26 I knew I said to the fucking voicemail
02:33:28 I forgot what it was
02:33:30 oh it was you
02:33:32 you fucker
02:33:34 I forgot about it
02:33:36 okay
02:33:38 okay cool
02:33:40 thanks
02:33:42 thanks man
02:33:44 good shit
02:33:46 you got that 5-4 groove going on
02:33:48 is that what that was
02:33:50 that was a fucking
02:33:52 time signature
02:33:54 is that doing like a disturbed
02:33:56 like
02:33:58 at the end
02:34:00 it was like you will never have any cake
02:34:02 you will never have any cake
02:34:04 it wasn't the drum line from
02:34:06 down with the sickness
02:34:08 no that's 4-4
02:34:10 5-4 is like 1 2 3 4 5
02:34:12 5-4 is real fun
02:34:14 most random sentences
02:34:16 if you just save them rhythmically
02:34:18 end up being 5-4 in my experience
02:34:20 you will never have any cake
02:34:22 yeah
02:34:24 yeah
02:34:26 sorry for your ears
02:34:30 that's okay
02:34:32 did I post it
02:34:34 the next one is called
02:34:36 it's called tiny facts number 1
02:34:38 a tiny fact
02:34:40 3 2 1 go
02:34:42 it's me
02:34:44 the muffin man
02:34:46 I like the way he cooks the dough
02:34:48 you're the muffin man
02:34:50 but you like the way he cooks
02:34:52 who's he
02:34:54 I don't know
02:34:56 I don't know
02:34:58 there's so many holes in this
02:35:00 story I don't think I trust this guy
02:35:02 the next
02:35:04 it's a very tiny fact
02:35:06 it sure was
02:35:08 vanishingly small
02:35:10 the next one is called we did it boys
02:35:12 racism is no more
02:35:14 alright
02:35:16 1 go
02:35:18 on one of the recent episodes
02:35:20 Ben expressed his opinion that gender and race are fake
02:35:22 and we shouldn't treat people differently because of those characteristics
02:35:24 given croc disagreed
02:35:26 so Ben quickly folded as befitting of a spineless
02:35:28 beta cut
02:35:30 in relation to that I'd like to know your opinion on Asian
02:35:32 penalty in the US
02:35:34 Asian penalty
02:35:36 like football
02:35:38 like football penalty
02:35:40 kickoffs
02:35:42 like how Japan
02:35:44 a world cup
02:35:46 one time
02:35:48 I don't think that conversation
02:35:50 happened according to as this person
02:35:52 describes it I don't think I
02:35:54 I don't remember that either
02:35:56 what is Asian penalty
02:35:58 okay
02:36:00 do they mean like Chinese
02:36:02 I think they're talking about
02:36:04 what's the word
02:36:06 when you do something bad
02:36:08 and the government says points deducted
02:36:10 okay I think they're basically talking
02:36:12 about
02:36:14 the opposite of affirmative action
02:36:16 where colleges
02:36:18 won't take Asian people
02:36:20 because they have too many
02:36:22 I think that's what it is
02:36:24 weird
02:36:28 I think
02:36:30 I don't know I think it's neutral
02:36:32 I think it's neutral
02:36:36 I think affirmative action
02:36:38 is generally good
02:36:40 and
02:36:44 whatever those
02:36:46 Asian kids can just go to a different college
02:36:48 just like everybody else
02:36:50 big fucking deal
02:36:52 whatever
02:36:54 it's maybe not great but it's not
02:36:56 that big a deal
02:36:58 I don't think affirmative action should
02:37:00 negatively affect
02:37:02 Asian applicants
02:37:04 I thought the idea was like if two people
02:37:06 have equal qualifications
02:37:08 you give it to the person who probably
02:37:10 struggled harder to get there
02:37:12 well yeah
02:37:14 I mean yes
02:37:16 but it's not like Asians don't experience racism
02:37:18 or I guess it's a different kind of racism
02:37:20 I mean
02:37:22 you necessarily
02:37:24 if two people
02:37:26 have a thing and you have to give one
02:37:28 or the other
02:37:30 you're necessarily denying it to the other
02:37:32 that's just life
02:37:34 I mean
02:37:36 I mean
02:37:38 I don't know
02:37:40 it's a zero sum gain
02:37:42 it's a zero sum gain
02:37:44 I guess it's bad
02:37:46 I guess it's bad if like
02:37:48 an Asian person who
02:37:50 qualifies for something doesn't get it
02:37:52 and the reason is
02:37:54 in some part because they had to fill a quota
02:37:56 they had to give it to someone else to fill
02:37:58 some race quota or whatever
02:38:00 for anything right but like
02:38:02 the opposite would be just as bad
02:38:04 like if they gave it to the Asian kid
02:38:06 and not to the
02:38:08 someone is losing out either way
02:38:10 so it's not like an
02:38:12 ill has been inflicted on the world
02:38:14 a resource was moved from one person to another
02:38:16 which is just
02:38:18 happens all the time
02:38:20 and is normal
02:38:22 just go to a different college
02:38:24 the resource of my bullet has been moved
02:38:26 to the resource of your brain
02:38:28 true
02:38:30 I'm just trying to remember the
02:38:32 conversation
02:38:34 I just think racism is good actually
02:38:36 you know, sometimes racism is actually good
02:38:38 most of the time
02:38:40 we finally have a left at bits
02:38:42 you know what
02:38:44 I was kind of racist all along
02:38:46 we all were
02:38:48 I can't remember what that conversation was
02:38:50 I don't know anything
02:38:52 lol
02:38:54 I don't know if I listened to the episode that was referencing
02:38:56 gender
02:38:58 I don't think I would have said
02:39:00 it's fake like money
02:39:02 it's real because we make it real
02:39:04 yeah
02:39:06 whatever
02:39:08 okay
02:39:10 next voicemail
02:39:12 where did I put it
02:39:14 it's called
02:39:16 fuck I lost it
02:39:18 I lost it because that was one of those
02:39:20 those
02:39:22 vocaru messages
02:39:24 just get a fucking microphone
02:39:26 just get a microphone
02:39:28 okay
02:39:30 okay
02:39:32 next one is called
02:39:34 34
02:39:36 where's the number
02:39:38 no sorry the next one is an image
02:39:40 the
02:39:42 I can't
02:39:44 there
02:39:46 posted
02:39:50 okay
02:39:52 so we have
02:39:54 whatever
02:39:56 defeated by
02:39:58 I assume this is mage
02:40:00 glowing
02:40:02 effulgent with power
02:40:04 can't believe defeated by a woman
02:40:06 and then it's me saying Nate we don't know their pronouns
02:40:08 I get it
02:40:10 I get it because
02:40:12 the joke is that I'm obnoxious
02:40:14 the joke is
02:40:16 true
02:40:18 but why are you on the right side of the screen
02:40:20 why is Nate to the left of you here
02:40:22 that's true
02:40:24 it's this
02:40:26 what we just said nice art
02:40:28 it is nice art
02:40:30 this guy
02:40:32 this guy kills it
02:40:34 this guy is really killing it in the voicemails
02:40:36 I gotta say
02:40:38 okay next one I posted up above
02:40:40 it's called hmm
02:40:42 it's the one we didn't listen to okay 3 2 1
02:40:44 go
02:40:46 I just wanted to test if
02:40:48 my mic works better
02:40:50 with socks on
02:40:52 or without socks
02:40:54 so now comes
02:40:56 the review
02:41:00 let's see if there is any difference
02:41:02 well viewers
02:41:04 well viewers what do you think
02:41:06 with socks or without socks vote down below
02:41:08 vote in the comments
02:41:12 I guess
02:41:14 my advice to the voicemailers
02:41:16 use your own ears
02:41:18 don't send it through
02:41:20 a service that like
02:41:22 purchases your audio and makes it probably worse
02:41:24 he can only tell if it's better
02:41:26 if he hears us listen to it on the PCP
02:41:28 a week later just so you know
02:41:30 listener a speak pipe
02:41:32 fucks with the audio that gets sent through
02:41:34 and makes it lower quality so
02:41:36 it's not a good way to test if something
02:41:38 sounds good
02:41:40 or is it
02:41:42 I have voicemails I've never sent because
02:41:44 I had a lot of advanced audio editing
02:41:46 and speak pipe just fucking like
02:41:48 tries to mute all of my sound effects
02:41:50 and then it just sounds like it's underwater
02:41:52 so it's just not like this
02:41:54 you gotta use vocru
02:41:56 vocru has a shitty bit rate is a problem
02:41:58 oh
02:42:00 that's when I put a link
02:42:02 to download and the thing
02:42:04 and then you complain
02:42:06 yeah I did
02:42:08 that's me
02:42:12 next voicemail is
02:42:14 this is another genes
02:42:16 here we go
02:42:18 3, 2, 1
02:42:20 wait
02:42:22 I'm stupid
02:42:24 the 35
02:42:26 35 is genes
02:42:28 3, 2, 1, go
02:42:44 with my high school friends was
02:42:46 Halo 3, Reach
02:42:48 and Halo 4
02:42:50 while those were fun multiplayer games
02:42:52 they didn't laugh with any interesting
02:42:54 conversations
02:42:56 and I didn't have any significant
02:42:58 recollection of those events
02:43:00 could you recommend
02:43:02 any similar comfy play foods
02:43:04 that I can cozy up and listen to
02:43:06 yeah if you're playing Halo
02:43:08 I mean you're like you're
02:43:10 you're engaged you're being like
02:43:12 or I'm gonna be shot
02:43:14 you're heavily engaged
02:43:16 cozy play throughs
02:43:20 do you mean like let's play videos
02:43:22 or do you mean like games that
02:43:24 can be like Ape Escape
02:43:26 in a cozy way
02:43:28 my cozy playthroughs
02:43:30 that I like so much
02:43:32 is I really really like
02:43:34 gdq speedruns of
02:43:36 Final Fantasy games and like
02:43:38 Chrono Trigger like 9 hour long
02:43:40 ones of like Final Fantasy 8
02:43:42 and stuff
02:43:44 that's the that's the
02:43:46 good content for me
02:43:48 I guess who excel
02:43:50 did a bunch that I like a lot
02:43:52 I guess this is sort of normal
02:43:54 but I like game grumps
02:43:56 there's a lot of good
02:43:58 old game grumps things but you probably already knew
02:44:00 that so I don't know
02:44:02 meaningful conversations
02:44:06 I don't think Ape Escape is specifically
02:44:08 like tailored for that sort of thing
02:44:10 I'm trying to figure out
02:44:12 what they mean
02:44:14 they missed out on playing
02:44:16 games that if played with
02:44:18 friends would result in
02:44:20 deep conversations
02:44:22 it just comes from having deep things to talk about
02:44:24 I think what she's saying is that
02:44:26 she didn't have
02:44:28 yeah cause they were all actively
02:44:30 playing Halo they were focused on the game
02:44:32 I think the thing about the
02:44:34 that playthrough and that game
02:44:36 is not that it was Ape Escape
02:44:38 it's that you were playing
02:44:40 and the rest of us were just kind of hanging out
02:44:42 yeah and like only sort of half
02:44:44 paying attention to the game
02:44:46 is me and Jesse passing it to each other
02:44:48 and then everyone was just hanging out
02:44:50 Davoo fell asleep
02:44:52 the best game
02:44:54 to just chill
02:44:56 and talk with your friends is Minecraft
02:44:58 that's a good one
02:45:00 yeah that's true
02:45:02 a lot of Minecraft is
02:45:04 just with your friends and just build some shit together
02:45:06 it's great
02:45:08 like you have your own little solo project that you're working on
02:45:10 and then occasionally
02:45:12 you invite them over to see your house
02:45:14 or you go to see theirs
02:45:16 and you just sort of hang out and stand around
02:45:18 and talk
02:45:20 it's nice
02:45:22 it's a good time
02:45:26 yeah I guess that answers the question
02:45:28 next one
02:45:30 yep
02:45:32 next one is called
02:45:34 drawcast idea
02:45:36 well good thing you're here for this oblivion
02:45:38 you've stolen our fucking thing

02:45:42 3, 2, 1, go
02:45:48 it was silent
02:45:50 it was okay
02:45:52 is that the joke?
02:45:54 the joke is don't do the drawcast
02:45:58 well we weren't going to
02:46:00 don't worry
02:46:02 that's a lie you know me and Gibb
02:46:04 we're doing a drawcast later today

02:46:30 I'm going to draw scream
02:46:32 from scream with fat titties
02:46:34 underneath their cloak and their mask
02:46:36 it's not going to be a scream mask
02:46:38 we're going to be
02:46:40 cumin
02:46:42 it's going to be great
02:46:44 it's going to be cumin
02:46:46 like my curry
02:46:48 every drawcast episode my goal
02:46:50 is to draw a character with big tits or ass
02:46:52 so that can be the thumbnail
02:46:54 it's the only way
02:46:56 the only way
02:46:58 the only way to what I don't know
02:47:02 next next voicemail is called
02:47:04 sad wait no I think I already posted
02:47:06 I'm losing track yes I already posted it
02:47:08 next one is called sad
02:47:10 three two one go
02:47:14 I've experienced life
02:47:16 later what
02:47:18 a series
02:47:20 of humiliation
02:47:22 and defeats
02:47:24 what are you talking about
02:47:26 don't stop
02:47:28 I haven't got a
02:47:30 got a W
02:47:32 ever since I was born
02:47:36 oh gee I can't imagine
02:47:38 couldn't be me
02:47:42 are you okay
02:47:44 don't have the constitution
02:47:46 for suicide
02:47:48 as the guy says
02:47:50 I'm true detective
02:47:52 but other than that I see
02:47:54 no reason not to quit
02:48:04 your job
02:48:06 don't kill yourself
02:48:08 he's saying okay
02:48:10 I understand the point
02:48:12 what he's saying it's just he took so long
02:48:14 to say it with his like bizarre
02:48:16 like drawing like
02:48:18 took him like so long
02:48:20 he sounded like he's drunk
02:48:22 don't kill yourself
02:48:24 he's got the Eleazar accent
02:48:26 but it's not Eleazar
02:48:30 it's some kind of
02:48:32 South American accent
02:48:34 I can't place it more specifically than that
02:48:36 but
02:48:38 yeah don't kill yourself
02:48:40 is what I would say
02:48:42 dude here's the thing
02:48:44 W's
02:48:46 come after L's in the alphabet
02:48:48 I keep digging
02:48:50 keep going through those letters
02:48:52 yeah it's just
02:48:54 wow that's deep
02:48:56 W comes after L in the alphabet
02:48:58 by sex toys
02:49:00 it's like
02:49:02 it's like tomato anus
02:49:04 always says you guys ever watched tomato anus
02:49:06 no but I like that
02:49:10 he does speedrun explain videos
02:49:12 he'll walk through
02:49:14 a record breaking speedrun
02:49:16 and he'll just explain like what is the runner doing
02:49:18 here and here and here
02:49:20 every single video that he makes
02:49:22 he will at a completely random point
02:49:24 just insert a little
02:49:26 like 30 second bit where he's just like
02:49:28 and by the way I just want to say
02:49:30 the things will get better for you and if things are going well
02:49:32 if you feel bad now you won't always feel that way
02:49:34 and there's always hope and people that love you
02:49:36 and I just want you to know
02:49:38 that the things will get better
02:49:40 alright back to the run anyway
02:49:42 frame perfect inputs
02:49:44 so just go watch one of those
02:49:46 and just assume that
02:49:48 pretend that I said what he says
02:49:50 don't kill yourself
02:49:52 we love you
02:49:54 tomato anus
02:49:56 he's a wise man
02:49:58 I was just curious
02:50:00 has anyone personified
02:50:02 a tomato
02:50:04 as a girl
02:50:06 and drawn her with an ass
02:50:08 and they have
02:50:10 of course
02:50:12 it's a round
02:50:14 it's a fruit
02:50:16 these images are so bad
02:50:18 the only two images of like
02:50:20 tomato women
02:50:22 is an among us with a tomato
02:50:24 leaf and tits
02:50:26 and then one that's shitting catch up
02:50:28 and one that's farting and those are the only results
02:50:30 on rule 34
02:50:32 no one of them is an among us
02:50:34 I mean I guess this one's not explicit
02:50:36 I guess this one's technically
02:50:38 like technically won't get us
02:50:40 on youtube
02:50:42 the other ones will
02:50:44 because they involve anuses
02:50:46 but I did find
02:50:48 I found tomato anus just believe me
02:50:50 what did we get
02:50:52 that community guidelines strike for
02:50:54 it was for the
02:50:56 the link to the tails gets trolled
02:50:58 or jerry getting fucked by the dog
02:51:00 it's because it recognized the URL
02:51:02 of the website I think
02:51:04 we still have
02:51:06 we still have a strike
02:51:08 on the channel from the time that we
02:51:10 posted the
02:51:12 the shadbase link
02:51:14 in the description
02:51:16 even though we took it out
02:51:18 it was like a long time ago
02:51:20 but it's about to I think it expires this month
02:51:22 so that's exciting
02:51:24 but yeah we've had a strike on the channel
02:51:26 because of that link for like
02:51:28 a year
02:51:30 we didn't get the strike when we posted
02:51:32 it was retroactively applied
02:51:34 like much later
02:51:36 when I mentioned I was drawing
02:51:38 like boobs
02:51:40 booby in one of my voicemails
02:51:42 and I just linked the image
02:51:44 you linked the uncensored image
02:51:46 in the video description
02:51:48 maybe that should also be removed
02:51:50 or replaced with a censored version
02:51:52 in the one that you were on
02:51:54 I think it doesn't look at the image
02:51:56 I think it looks at the link
02:51:58 text
02:52:00 and if it matches with like
02:52:02 rule 34 that's a not allowed
02:52:04 site
02:52:06 I'm nervous about it because
02:52:08 they've retroactively applied them
02:52:10 the fact that it didn't trigger the thing
02:52:12 doesn't mean that it's safe
02:52:14 and that it won't be triggered in the future
02:52:16 if you tell me which episode it is
02:52:18 I can go and edit the description
02:52:20 I can try to figure it out
02:52:22 you weren't on the episode
02:52:24 I wasn't on it
02:52:26 it was a voicemail
02:52:28 all I know is it was one of the ones
02:52:30 with the gravestones
02:52:32 I don't know why
02:52:34 there's no particular reason why I'm bringing this up now
02:52:36 but I want to mention that last night
02:52:38 I drank a
02:52:40 see this is the price
02:52:42 this is the price of spooky season
02:52:44 nobody talks about the damage
02:52:46 it is inflicted on society
02:52:48 from the spooky season meme
02:52:50 I drank a pumpkin flavored
02:52:52 hard seltzer
02:52:54 it was so bad
02:52:56 I know it sounded awful and I was like
02:52:58 that sounds awful and I tried it
02:53:00 and it really was
02:53:02 it was terrible
02:53:04 it's not right
02:53:06 it's not the normal flavor
02:53:08 choice for such a thing
02:53:10 it didn't work but oh
02:53:12 it's so cozy
02:53:14 the meme
02:53:16 has to die
02:53:18 I'm going to be the one to kill it
02:53:20 the instagram girl version
02:53:22 of Halloween spooky season
02:53:24 is certainly
02:53:26 trite
02:53:28 it's just like shut up
02:53:30 I like chocolate
02:53:32 and I like punk
02:53:34 and ghosts and skeletons
02:53:36 I don't really like ghosts and skeletons
02:53:40 and pumpkin is okay
02:53:42 skeletons are funny
02:53:44 honestly
02:53:46 I like pumpkin stuff
02:53:48 the fact like when it's October
02:53:50 I like pumpkin stuff less
02:53:52 because I'm like I don't want to eat it
02:53:54 it's a meme it's a meme now
02:53:56 my enjoyment is not
02:53:58 my enjoyment is not authentic
02:54:00 get a big fucking turnip
02:54:02 get a big fucking tomato
02:54:04 I like pumpkin flavored eggnog
02:54:06 and ice cream
02:54:08 and all that shit it's great
02:54:10 but when it's being commodified
02:54:12 when capitalism has turned it into
02:54:14 a consumer
02:54:16 for the holiday
02:54:18 what everyone tell me about Halloween
02:54:20 is all about
02:54:22 the true meaning of Halloween
02:54:24 it's to get fucked
02:54:26 it's to get
02:54:28 wow
02:54:30 I guess I was wrong
02:54:32 it's to get fucked
02:54:34 sure
02:54:36 I mean Halloween stuff
02:54:38 is very much less commercialized
02:54:40 over here because it
02:54:42 even though we celebrate it
02:54:44 it has always felt like a big American thing
02:54:46 it's from America
02:54:48 I was shocked
02:54:50 I didn't realize when I lived in Poland
02:54:52 it was October
02:54:54 October came around and it was Halloween
02:54:56 and nobody did anything
02:54:58 I saw
02:55:00 I might have seen a couple
02:55:02 a handful of college students that were wearing a costume
02:55:04 but
02:55:06 it just kind of wasn't a thing
02:55:08 I thought everybody did Halloween
02:55:10 I didn't think it was just an American thing
02:55:12 and it's not just an American thing
02:55:14 but it's
02:55:16 most of
02:55:18 everybody does it over here
02:55:20 most of it comes from
02:55:22 not culturally
02:55:24 but my understanding of Halloween
02:55:26 comes from Halloween American movies
02:55:28 stuff that takes place in Halloween
02:55:30 spooky things
02:55:32 all the iconography and stuff
02:55:34 it's Hollywood
02:55:36 sure
02:55:38 it's our main export
02:55:40 we're civilizing the rest of you
02:55:44 next voicemail
02:55:46 is called
02:55:48 sex
02:55:50 sex

02:56:08 why does Kazi hate Nate?

02:56:16 Nate
02:56:18 is he real or is it ironic
02:56:20 and why
02:56:22 did he do something

02:56:38 the stuff that Nate says

03:00:16 masterpiece
03:00:18 immigration is a form of colonialism Abby
03:00:20 we need to hashtag build a wall
03:00:22 booba

03:00:30 this is very true
03:00:32 it rings very true yeah
03:00:34 I like that
03:00:36 I have 9 subscribers and I'm called
03:00:38 patreon.com
03:00:40 on youtube
03:00:42 should have unironically called my channel that
03:00:44 413 views
03:00:46 haha
03:00:48 413 views yes true
03:00:50 cycloneal is not a socialist
03:00:52 masterpiece
03:00:54 but the version of me
03:00:56 that made this video
03:00:58 it's a socialist-ish piece
03:01:00 it's a socialist-ish
03:01:02 it is
03:01:04 it's social-ish
03:01:06 it's so delish
03:01:08 we never
03:01:10 I never re-read
03:01:12 cycloneals for the cycloneals cast
03:01:14 we could always do it
03:01:16 but we could always do it
03:01:18 I still want to
03:01:20 I still wanted to do one about it
03:01:22 at this point I would have to re-read it
03:01:24 myself as well
03:01:26 okay I don't want to think about that
03:01:28 I got fucking shit to do
03:01:30 next voicemail is called
03:01:32 J
03:01:34 wait no here it is
03:01:36 there it is
03:01:38 wait do we listen to the last one
03:01:40 it's 0 seconds
03:01:42 there's no content
03:01:44 next one is called J
03:01:46 one go
03:01:48 what's your opinion on comics
03:01:50 drawn by people with no artistic
03:01:52 talent
03:01:54 do you think the story has to be funny
03:01:56 for terrible art to be justified
03:01:58 I am asking this
03:02:00 because I am a person with zero
03:02:02 artistic knowledge and I'm planning to make
03:02:04 a comic but it's supposed to have
03:02:06 a serious tone not a comical
03:02:08 tone
03:02:10 that's tough
03:02:12 comics and all
03:02:14 illustrations can look
03:02:16 raggedy
03:02:18 there's no correct way
03:02:20 the cleaner the lines are
03:02:22 doesn't mean it's better
03:02:24 if you can find a way
03:02:26 to communicate whatever ideas
03:02:28 you have
03:02:30 with the level of talent you have
03:02:32 because if it's a serious
03:02:34 story and you don't have
03:02:36 any artistic drawing talent
03:02:38 but you can write the dialogue
03:02:40 or whatever
03:02:42 you can basically make it text
03:02:44 there's no rules
03:02:46 you could also
03:02:48 get away with
03:02:50 even if you can't draw particularly well
03:02:52 if you're good at setting up a visual tone
03:02:54 for the use of color or something
03:02:56 that could also help
03:02:58 you ever read
03:03:00 you ever read Kate Wertz
03:03:02 comics
03:03:04 yes
03:03:06 though she's really good at drawing
03:03:08 she is good
03:03:10 there's sketchy there
03:03:12 there's a lot that goes into drawing anything
03:03:14 even
03:03:16 things that a layman might assume
03:03:18 is like oh that's lazy work
03:03:20 that's easy to draw
03:03:22 but I mean obviously not really
03:03:24 no
03:03:28 just work within your means I guess
03:03:30 if you know you can't really draw
03:03:32 very well but you really want to draw something
03:03:36 if you try to paint
03:03:38 a masterpiece thing
03:03:40 it's probably
03:03:42 not a good place to start
03:03:44 you can work towards it of course
03:03:46 you okay I think
03:03:48 it's tough if you have
03:03:50 a tone in mind
03:03:52 if you have a serious tone in mind
03:03:54 and it's like well
03:03:56 if you're a
03:03:58 bad artist
03:04:00 and you just kind of go with it
03:04:02 I mean it's going to draw attention to itself
03:04:04 like the bad artist is going to call attention to itself
03:04:06 and it might be tough
03:04:08 to make that work in a serious
03:04:10 story
03:04:12 well yeah I think if they're asking
03:04:14 because they said they don't want it to be a comedic
03:04:16 work and from
03:04:18 like tales gets trolled
03:04:20 some of the things there are like
03:04:22 not supposed to be funny
03:04:24 they're supposed to be intense and gory
03:04:26 and scary but they nonetheless
03:04:28 are hilarious because
03:04:30 of how badly they're drawn despite
03:04:32 how serious they're trying to be
03:04:34 for a number of reasons
03:04:36 for a number of reasons
03:04:38 like if I imagine like oh berserk
03:04:40 but drawn by a laserbot
03:04:42 it would not
03:04:44 work as well in conveying
03:04:46 guts and his like
03:04:48 struggle if it was drawn like that
03:04:50 but
03:04:52 there are ways
03:04:54 I think it's mostly because
03:04:56 like drawing a character from berserk
03:04:58 requires
03:05:00 knowledge of anatomy but if you draw
03:05:02 a character that deliberately is not supposed
03:05:04 to be anatomically correct
03:05:06 you sort of sidestep
03:05:08 the implication
03:05:10 that you are failing at doing something
03:05:12 if it may if it looks deliberate
03:05:14 if you know what I mean
03:05:16 I think if okay you can't
03:05:18 you say you can't draw okay
03:05:20 I think the only way
03:05:22 the only way is you're gonna have
03:05:24 you're gonna have to bust out the old tablet
03:05:26 or whatever and you're gonna have to like doodle
03:05:28 you're gonna have to like experiment with what you
03:05:30 can draw and just try and find
03:05:32 some balance
03:05:34 of something that you are able to do
03:05:36 and that like looks close enough
03:05:38 that it doesn't look like
03:05:40 distractingly different than like
03:05:42 what tone you're going for
03:05:44 you can't it's there probably is
03:05:46 some I can't think off the
03:05:48 top of my head of any like very
03:05:50 like I was thinking one punch man
03:05:52 one punch man was drawn very sketchily
03:05:54 but like that's a that's not
03:05:56 it's not exactly a comedy
03:05:58 it's partly a comedy it's also possible
03:06:00 to like go for a really simplified
03:06:02 style that just looks appealing
03:06:04 like appeal can also
03:06:06 be fine on its own
03:06:08 something like I mean yeah
03:06:10 you could just go for like a hyper minimalist
03:06:12 sort of thing and that could
03:06:14 like um
03:06:16 I don't know like like Paul
03:06:18 Paul who is a ghost I mean that's
03:06:20 that's a comedy a comedy it's partially a comedy
03:06:22 is that what is called Paul
03:06:24 who is a
03:06:28 uh
03:06:30 uh
03:06:32 it's a yeah it's a comic
03:06:34 but it was from a website the website was
03:06:36 do you know
03:06:38 do you know what I'm talking about Paul who is a ghost
03:06:40 I think I can't find it on google
03:06:42 no it was a it was
03:06:44 a webcomic okay I don't know
03:06:46 oh pictures pictures for sad children
03:06:48 pictures for sad children is the
03:06:50 webcomic I'm thinking of it is
03:06:52 it is somewhat it is comedic but it is
03:06:54 it has a sort of
03:06:56 serious tone to it
03:06:58 and is hyper minimalist
03:07:00 yeah super hyper minimalist can
03:07:02 work I think the the the main thing
03:07:04 to remember is that
03:07:06 if it looks
03:07:08 if whatever style you're drawing looks
03:07:10 deliberately drawn that way
03:07:12 and it doesn't look like you've tried
03:07:14 and failed to do something that you can't do
03:07:16 then it would then it will come
03:07:18 across as less comedic
03:07:20 so if if you think of like
03:07:22 an artsy fartsy um student
03:07:24 film because I've seen a lot of those
03:07:26 artsy fartsy student films
03:07:28 and student film animation
03:07:30 things they're drawn
03:07:32 you know sometimes
03:07:34 the the the student can't draw
03:07:36 very well but they have a very serious
03:07:38 topic that they want to talk about in their
03:07:40 film and
03:07:42 they're sincere and they're earnest
03:07:44 and they're not trying
03:07:46 to go beyond you know the good ones
03:07:48 I mean they're not trying to do
03:07:50 what they can't do
03:07:52 and because of that you can sort of buy
03:07:54 this really shitty art
03:07:56 telling this sad story
03:07:58 so or not necessarily sad
03:08:00 but like non comedic
03:08:02 so it can work
03:08:04 yeah yeah
03:08:06 so you've got options
03:08:08 it's not it's not hopeless
03:08:10 but you gotta you gotta you're gonna have to experiment
03:08:12 you're gonna have to try different things
03:08:14 and strike upon something that you think
03:08:16 you can do and that works with the
03:08:18 story you're trying to tell
03:08:20 if possible
03:08:22 next voicemail is
03:08:24 it's number
03:08:26 43 here and it is
03:08:28 called
03:08:30 patreon.com
03:08:32 3 2 1 go
03:08:36 saw someone on twitter talking
03:08:38 about how
03:08:40 like they were upset that someone
03:08:42 on patreon had essentially pledged
03:08:44 just for a reward and then
03:08:46 immediately unplugged
03:08:48 like gave them the dollar got the thing
03:08:50 got out and their basis
03:08:52 for their argument was basically like
03:08:54 oh you don't pledge to patreon
03:08:56 for the reward so you pledge to support
03:08:58 a creator this is a
03:09:00 super dick move if you do something like this
03:09:02 psa guys don't
03:09:04 psa don't do this
03:09:06 give me psa
03:09:08 you care if people do that on your
03:09:10 patreon
03:09:12 like people you put a reward
03:09:14 at a dollar amount
03:09:16 it's so rude
03:09:18 it's so rude for you to pay the amount
03:09:20 that I asked you to pay in exchange for the thing
03:09:22 I said you could have
03:09:24 yeah
03:09:26 if they were talking about themselves
03:09:28 if they were talking about like someone just pledged
03:09:30 to my patreon and then unplugged
03:09:32 psa don't do this
03:09:34 this is a bad move
03:09:36 like that would be so gauche
03:09:38 you're just telling people not to pledge to you
03:09:40 that's money you're not getting
03:09:42 if you're not happy
03:09:44 the sort of person who
03:09:46 is not interested in pledging long term
03:09:48 which is a lot of people
03:09:50 even if they do like your work just because of
03:09:52 money issues they just need to
03:09:54 hop on and off and that's fine
03:09:56 the sort of person who would
03:09:58 pledge just for a reward is the sort of person
03:10:00 who would not have pledged had the reward
03:10:02 not been there
03:10:04 they would not have just become
03:10:06 a supporter
03:10:08 it's extra money you're getting
03:10:10 if you think that your reward is
03:10:12 not
03:10:14 it's
03:10:16 more than what they should be getting for
03:10:18 you know a single pledge
03:10:20 then like don't make it a patreon reward
03:10:22 like sell it on whatever you're offering
03:10:24 sell it on gumroad or something
03:10:26 or at least up your like
03:10:28 tiers to be more expensive or something
03:10:30 yeah up your tiers or do it some other way
03:10:32 like you're the one that put it on
03:10:34 the marketplace at that price
03:10:36 if you see like a guy on patreon
03:10:38 who's getting like 10,000 a month for some crazy shit
03:10:40 only like half that money
03:10:42 is probably going to be from like long time supporters
03:10:44 a lot of it's going to be people who pop in and out
03:10:46 but if there's enough of them that can still be
03:10:48 a consistent revenue source
03:10:50 there's nothing wrong with that
03:10:52 it's going to happen and it's going to make you money
03:10:54 so accept it
03:10:56 imagine complaining about
03:10:58 someone pledging to you wrong
03:11:00 that's so annoying
03:11:02 you're giving me money to think about
03:11:06 plus to us instead we
03:11:08 appreciate every patron
03:11:10 we did, we did
03:11:12 someone on twitter when I made the post
03:11:14 with the new bonus episodes
03:11:16 someone was like
03:11:18 I'm just going to pledge
03:11:20 they were being cheeky
03:11:22 they were like I'm just going to pledge
03:11:24 and get all the episodes and un-pledge
03:11:26 and I was like no don't give us $5
03:11:28 oh no please
03:11:30 don't do it
03:11:32 how will we ever recover
03:11:34 yeah
03:11:36 next
03:11:38 voicemail is called
03:11:40 oh it's another, it's just called
03:11:42 who designed the procrastinators podcast logo
03:11:44 there's no audio
03:11:46 the answer is divu
03:11:48 I forget
03:11:50 the reasoning for it
03:11:52 I guess I could scroll back in the
03:11:54 PCP chat and maybe find where divu said it
03:11:56 was there reasoning for it?
03:11:58 I think they had reasoning for it
03:12:00 but I don't remember
03:12:02 and it was such a long time ago
03:12:04 they just made it
03:12:06 and it's like okay how about this
03:12:08 and we were like yeah that sounds cool
03:12:10 we know what CDs are, we're old
03:12:12 it's funny
03:12:14 the background of the image
03:12:16 well I changed the icon
03:12:18 to be the gravestone one
03:12:20 but the old image in the background
03:12:22 it had some gray shit
03:12:24 and it was actually the vapors
03:12:26 it was a page of the vapors that was
03:12:28 partially scribbled over I think
03:12:30 that's what that is, interesting
03:12:32 why?
03:12:34 I'm pretty sure, yeah the old
03:12:36 maybe if I have the file
03:12:38 do I have the full size file on my
03:12:40 computer somewhere
03:12:42 yeah I think if you look at the
03:12:44 I want to
03:12:46 fuck where is it
03:12:48 D drive, PCP folder
03:12:54 wait it would be in the google drive
03:12:56 the full size
03:12:58 version
03:13:00 you can't see it on the small version
03:13:02 hold on I'm going to do it
03:13:04 I'm logging in
03:13:06 I remember doing some fucking stuff
03:13:08 if you're a logo when I did my
03:13:10 PCP theme way back
03:13:12 I was making an icon for it
03:13:14 and I didn't know what that sketchy stuff was
03:13:16 and I had to recreate something similar
03:13:18 yeah I'm almost
03:13:20 I just want to look and see
03:13:22 and just make absolutely sure that I'm not making
03:13:24 complete fool of myself
03:13:26 PCP components
03:13:28 theme
03:13:30 theme assets
03:13:32 I'm looking through the
03:13:34 no those are audio assets
03:13:36 images and logos, here we go
03:13:38 general
03:13:40 here we go
03:13:42 here we go
03:13:44 download this one
03:13:46 scanning for viruses
03:13:48 let's examine this
03:13:50 closely
03:13:52 there it goes
03:13:54 uploading
03:13:56 yeah it's the
03:13:58 vapors, it's the bush
03:14:00 it's bushes and trees
03:14:04 I don't know why
03:14:08 and there's another image
03:14:10 warped over it
03:14:12 it's like two pages of the vapors superimposed
03:14:14 on each other
03:14:16 I don't know
03:14:18 fascinating huh
03:14:22 sorry I was
03:14:24 for a second
03:14:26 there it is
03:14:28 sketchy vapors, sketchy vapors bushes
03:14:30 right I always had
03:14:32 the cutaway
03:14:34 PNG version
03:14:36 thumbnails and stuff
03:14:38 I wonder if I can find the image I created
03:14:40 for my
03:14:42 soundcloud thing because I also had to put some
03:14:44 scribbly lines in the background but there were different
03:14:46 scribbly lines
03:14:48 there's no real reason for it to be there
03:14:50 it's so strange
03:14:52 I thought it was like marble
03:14:54 never really looked at it
03:14:56 yeah I can see why you would think that
03:14:58 but no it's uh
03:15:00 it's that
03:15:02 just because
03:15:04 which voicemail
03:15:06 was that
03:15:08 that was
03:15:10 three
03:15:12 no that was uh
03:15:14 okay there's one more
03:15:16 voicemail
03:15:18 it is called I need it
03:15:20 here it is, found it
03:15:24 okay I need it
03:15:26 3, 2, 3, 2, 1
03:15:28 go
03:15:30 I need
03:15:32 breath mints
03:15:34 I need it
03:15:36 breath mints
03:15:38 it does not
03:15:40 need to come
03:15:42 from a cis woman
03:15:44 it can come
03:15:46 from a man with
03:15:48 big mommy
03:15:50 milkers
03:15:52 Ben
03:15:54 give me your breast
03:15:56 milk
03:15:58 that's what they said
03:16:00 okay
03:16:02 I'm on it chief
03:16:04 my tradition of harassing Ben is being continued
03:16:06 by the people
03:16:08 you started something but can't
03:16:10 when the voicemails were brand new
03:16:12 once let out the genie can't be put back in the bottle
03:16:14 when the voicemails were brand new I remember Ben
03:16:16 I remember you saying
03:16:18 why is so many of these voicemails about me
03:16:20 it was me Ben
03:16:22 yeah true
03:16:24 that makes sense
03:16:26 I'm seeing this meme theme
03:16:28 I'm seeing this meme theme here
03:16:30 what did you just scribble
03:16:32 that stuff in the background
03:16:34 I think I just googled like sketch of
03:16:36 trees and just
03:16:38 so you knew it was trees
03:16:40 I mean it sort of looks like trees and bushes
03:16:42 I could sort of tell
03:16:44 clouds like it had to be one of those things
03:16:46 it's one of the shots
03:16:48 of the scenery from
03:16:50 Vincent's point of view in Vapors Chapter 2
03:16:52 I know exactly what it is
03:16:54 I didn't know it's from Vapors that is some cool trivia
03:16:56 and also Voice Smailer
03:16:58 if you like breast milk
03:17:00 well I've been animating a pair of flopping titties
03:17:02 this whole time I've gone
03:17:04 I've been looking at them this whole time I've had my dick in my hand
03:17:06 the entire show
03:17:08 by the way
03:17:10 you can go to patreon.com
03:17:12 the content on patreon.com
03:17:14 slash oblivionfall is
03:17:16 it's my seal of approval
03:17:18 right now if I had to plug a money thing
03:17:20 it would be the GoFundMe please
03:17:22 yes the GoFundMe
03:17:24 to remove boobs
03:17:26 to remove boobs
03:17:28 it is a paradox
03:17:30 what is given can be taken away
03:17:32 it's not actually
03:17:34 it's not actually that confusing
03:17:38 what is that up to
03:17:40 how much do I talk about it
03:17:42 it's up to $600
03:17:44 and it's been one day
03:17:46 one day
03:17:48 actually slightly under 24 hours
03:17:50 as of our recording right now
03:17:52 I'm going to be doing
03:17:54 some live streams
03:17:56 to fundraise I'm going to be playing Undertale
03:17:58 for the first time
03:18:00 I've never played it
03:18:04 that's going to be a big live stream
03:18:06 I'm going to be doing a 12 hour variety stream
03:18:08 youtubers and stuff I know
03:18:10 and I'll be doing like a minecraft stream
03:18:12 where I try to speedrun the game
03:18:14 while my friends try to hunt down and kill me
03:18:16 that'll be fun but a few things planned
03:18:18 oh like dream
03:18:20 yeah like dream
03:18:22 just like that one guy
03:18:24 it is really fun except when we do it
03:18:26 it's not fake
03:18:28 I'm not going to say that dream fakes
03:18:30 those videos but there's a lot of
03:18:32 elements that are rehearsed
03:18:34 for sure
03:18:38 on twitch
03:18:40 stream on twitch or on youtube
03:18:42 it'll be on my oblivionfall youtube
03:18:44 the one with like
03:18:46 38,000 subscribers
03:18:48 not the really big one
03:18:50 I don't know what that audience is like
03:18:52 they scare me a little bit
03:18:54 the big one
03:18:56 are they there for the tits
03:18:58 they're there for the cumzone stuff
03:19:00 they'd be like a fundraiser to remove tits
03:19:02 I'm just going
03:19:04 I don't love you anymore
03:19:06 you'll be attacked
03:19:08 you'll be torn to shreds
03:19:10 you'll be hard and feathered
03:19:12 drawn and quartered
03:19:14 exactly
03:19:16 I don't want to risk
03:19:18 the demographics of those
03:19:20 freaking out those people
03:19:22 it can't hurt though right
03:19:24 maybe there's few people
03:19:26 well here's the thing
03:19:28 if it turns out that there's a bunch of people in there
03:19:30 who are like transphobic or something
03:19:32 which I don't know if that's true
03:19:34 I would rather
03:19:36 those people
03:19:38 support me for my animation
03:19:40 and then that money can go towards
03:19:42 my partner's bottom surgery later on
03:19:44 so that way they can unknowingly
03:19:46 aid in that endeavor
03:19:48 true
03:19:50 sneaky
03:19:52 but I mean
03:19:54 they're just there for the boobs which to be fair
03:19:56 that's reasonable
03:19:58 who can blame them
03:20:00 ugh
03:20:02 that's it that's the last voicemail
03:20:04 oh are you
03:20:06 I know
03:20:08 what else we got
03:20:10 did I complain about that terrible pumpkin seltzer
03:20:12 I did
03:20:14 I kicked a mouse the other day
03:20:16 you kicked a mouse
03:20:18 yeah there was a mouse
03:20:20 in my new shitty apartment
03:20:22 it got even shittier
03:20:24 there's a mouse running around in the kitchen
03:20:26 and I saw it on the table
03:20:28 and I saw it like climb down
03:20:30 I saw something at the corner of my eye
03:20:32 it was on the table and I see something
03:20:34 climbing down
03:20:36 the like rack that we keep our like
03:20:38 our pans on and it climbed down
03:20:40 to the floor and I see it
03:20:42 and I can see it start to run across the floor
03:20:44 it's right in front of me it's crossing right in front of me
03:20:46 I think
03:20:48 that I had
03:20:50 the ability in that moment
03:20:52 to kill it to put my foot out and
03:20:54 I saw its path I saw where it was going
03:20:56 I could have stopped it and killed it
03:20:58 I didn't have the courage
03:21:00 I was too squeamish
03:21:02 you thought about how it would feel to have your head crushed
03:21:04 I mean
03:21:06 that's the kind of thing that makes me squeamish
03:21:08 and makes me like I don't want to
03:21:10 I don't want to do that
03:21:12 so instead
03:21:14 I kicked it
03:21:16 I kicked it like a hacky sack
03:21:18 did it fly across the room
03:21:20 it did not fly across the room
03:21:22 it did not leave the ground it did not get air
03:21:24 but it did sort of go skidding
03:21:26 it kind of spun and skidded across the ground
03:21:28 and it sort of like
03:21:30 it wasn't even that hard
03:21:32 it didn't even hit that but it kind of thunked into
03:21:34 like the kitchen
03:21:36 sink cabinets
03:21:38 and then it like scurried between
03:21:40 the cabinet and the dishwasher
03:21:42 and I was like fuck
03:21:44 I should have why did I even bother
03:21:46 why did I even bother to do that
03:21:48 I could have killed it
03:21:50 now it just has a broken rib cage
03:21:52 maybe it'll just
03:21:54 saw it again later
03:21:56 it's literally better than ever
03:21:58 it was exhilarated
03:22:00 it got hit close to death
03:22:02 but it came back twice as strong
03:22:04 it just came back with a cool story to tell
03:22:08 that's all I gave it
03:22:10 I bought a bunch of traps
03:22:12 and set a bunch of traps in the kitchen
03:22:14 so maybe it will die soon
03:22:16 I guess we'll see
03:22:18 stomping a mouse to death is a bit
03:22:20 much for anyone I think
03:22:22 I one time in my old place
03:22:24 which at one time
03:22:26 did have mice in it we eventually killed all the
03:22:28 mice with traps but at one time it did
03:22:30 have a mouse problem and one time I
03:22:32 there was a mouse in the
03:22:34 near the trash can and I saw it
03:22:36 it like scurried and it stopped
03:22:38 and I froze and I was like
03:22:40 what do I do what do I do and I
03:22:42 dropped a pan on it and I killed it
03:22:44 by dropping like a metal pan and crushing it
03:22:46 it was not that gruesome
03:22:48 it wasn't like smushed
03:22:50 it was just you know
03:22:52 concussed and injured and bleeding
03:22:54 a little bit and it died
03:22:56 that's what you got to do I could have done it again
03:22:58 but I didn't want I don't want to feel its bones
03:23:00 crunching I don't feel its organs
03:23:02 squishing under my foot like
03:23:04 the thing with me is that
03:23:06 like I don't want to have to like
03:23:08 pick it up but I know no one else
03:23:10 will do it and it's
03:23:12 I don't want to leave it there
03:23:14 like a fucking towel
03:23:16 like get the blood off like
03:23:18 you when I moved
03:23:20 in my old
03:23:22 my old house the sanctity of life has nothing to do with it
03:23:24 it's just gross we had
03:23:26 we had a mouse problem for a while
03:23:28 at one time
03:23:30 a mouse was definitely running around
03:23:32 in my bedroom and I was like
03:23:34 this is fucking unacceptable this can't
03:23:36 fucking continue and there was a whole
03:23:38 my old room had a
03:23:40 it had sort of a little
03:23:42 like not a crawl space
03:23:44 it just had a weird like
03:23:46 it was a rectangular room
03:23:48 but on one side of it
03:23:50 between the far wall and the near wall there was just a gap
03:23:52 there was like a two foot wide little like
03:23:54 side space
03:23:56 that I just kept like a bookshelf in there
03:23:58 and in that
03:24:00 down that little side space
03:24:02 the inside corner of it at the very corner
03:24:04 underneath the radiator there was a little hole in the wall
03:24:06 and I was like
03:24:08 I saw a mouse one time crawling inside
03:24:10 the radiator
03:24:12 just going from one end of the radiator together
03:24:14 definitely coming from inside that hole
03:24:16 so I put glue traps
03:24:18 I put a glue trap in front of the hole
03:24:20 and I was like it can't come through here anymore
03:24:22 it'll step on the glue trap it'll die
03:24:24 I was clean so
03:24:26 fast forward like two years later I'm cleaning up my room
03:24:28 I'm packing up all my stuff I'm moving out
03:24:30 and I'm taking my bookshelf out of that hidey hole
03:24:32 space
03:24:34 and I see underneath it
03:24:36 it's kind of hidden underneath the radiator
03:24:38 I see the glue trap
03:24:40 there's something on it
03:24:42 I'm pretty sure
03:24:44 that there's just been a dead mouse
03:24:46 you know in the corner of my room
03:24:48 for like a year now and maybe
03:24:50 maybe it was the only mouse
03:24:52 and it got stuck in the glue trap and it died
03:24:54 maybe
03:24:56 it died there and other mice
03:24:58 would look at that hole
03:25:00 and think maybe I should come out into this room and then they would see
03:25:02 a corpse lying there and be like
03:25:04 no I don't want to go there actually
03:25:06 one way or another
03:25:08 it did stop mice from coming into my room
03:25:10 I never saw another one
03:25:12 so mission accomplished
03:25:14 didn't you smell dead mouse corpse?
03:25:16 no
03:25:18 I mean in terms of
03:25:20 like volume of
03:25:22 guts
03:25:24 mice don't have a lot
03:25:26 they're quite small they're very small
03:25:28 well this was Elton
03:25:30 I didn't look I didn't
03:25:32 I didn't want to look at it I didn't examine it closely
03:25:34 I'm pretty sure it was like a desiccated mouse
03:25:36 it was so
03:25:38 I couldn't even really tell what it was
03:25:40 when I saw it
03:25:42 but I think if I had looked closely I would have seen
03:25:44 like a withered mouse
03:25:46 remnants
03:25:48 I suspect
03:25:50 I mean how much does a mouse weigh
03:25:52 you could compare that to like leaving a bit of meat on the floor
03:25:54 right?
03:25:56 like one ounce
03:25:58 like nothing at all
03:26:00 house mouse like 0.68
03:26:02 mouse mouse one ounce
03:26:04 less than an ounce
03:26:06 waylord just like waylord
03:26:08 a mouse is lighter than air
03:26:10 by volume
03:26:12 it floats like a balloon
03:26:14 that's a fact
03:26:16 does that mean tiny
03:26:18 now that's a tiny fact
03:26:20 yeah it has
03:26:22 yeah it's volume
03:26:24 and it's mass
03:26:26 if you calculate it
03:26:28 it's literally lighter than air
03:26:30 and it's called the float whale
03:26:32 it's a float whale pokemon
03:26:34 it literally like floats like a balloon
03:26:36 alright so like a house mouse is like
03:26:38 0.04 pounds
03:26:40 that's like
03:26:42 a 25th of a pound
03:26:44 so if I take a pound of meat out of the freezer
03:26:46 it's less than an ounce
03:26:48 and take like
03:26:50 less than a 20th
03:26:52 take like 4% of it and leave it on the floor
03:26:54 that's not gonna smell
03:26:56 I don't think so
03:26:58 I have
03:27:00 one story
03:27:02 on the topic of being afraid to squish things
03:27:04 this is a
03:27:06 horror story from my real life
03:27:08 you know it's October
03:27:10 it's the season
03:27:12 for spookies
03:27:14 boo
03:27:16 no spookies allowed
03:27:18 so I was living
03:27:20 in Dunedin
03:27:22 which is at the bottom of the south
03:27:24 island of New Zealand
03:27:26 it's in
03:27:28 I'll post this image in chat
03:27:30 because I lived in the north island most of my life
03:27:32 but my family spent like
03:27:34 5 or 6 years living in Otago
03:27:36 specifically in Dunedin
03:27:38 and we're not supposed to get
03:27:40 a lot of bugs in that area
03:27:42 like most of the
03:27:44 New Zealand doesn't have many nasty bugs or animals
03:27:46 in fact it's one of the nicest places on earth
03:27:48 for avoiding that stuff
03:27:52 but we were in Dunedin
03:27:54 I was playing in the sand pit in the backyard
03:27:56 and I felt a scratch
03:27:58 scratch on my neck
03:28:00 and I'm like
03:28:02 I just kind of flicked at it
03:28:04 and then a few seconds later I feel it again
03:28:06 terrifying
03:28:08 and then I feel it really strongly
03:28:10 it's like on the side of my jaw
03:28:12 and I see something out of the corner of my eye
03:28:14 I swipe at it and a fucking
03:28:16 Avondale spider
03:28:18 drops into the sand in front of me
03:28:20 Avondale spider
03:28:22 I put a picture
03:28:24 that's a big boy
03:28:26 they are fucking huge
03:28:28 these things are not supposed to be in the south island
03:28:30 they're supposedly not there
03:28:32 but there is one of these fucking things on my face
03:28:34 I was like 8 years old
03:28:36 I screamed
03:28:38 yeah I mean fair
03:28:40 I would
03:28:42 I was fucking crying
03:28:44 and my sister out to kill it
03:28:46 and my sister didn't want to squish it
03:28:48 I thought you can't squish it
03:28:50 it's so big it must have bones
03:28:52 I'm getting uncomfortable
03:28:54 get this fucking image out of here
03:28:56 no I guess I'll leave it it's fine
03:28:58 no I can bear it
03:29:00 the people can suffer
03:29:02 this was on my face Ben
03:29:04 I was like
03:29:06 oh what if it's more spiders on me and I took a shower
03:29:08 but my sister used up two whole cans of fly spray
03:29:10 on this thing
03:29:12 one time I found a caterpillar crawling on my shoulder
03:29:14 and I was like oh my god what if there are other caterpillars on me
03:29:16 what if they're just on me all the time
03:29:18 and I just don't even know what to throw on me right now
03:29:20 caterpillars are cute though
03:29:22 I hate caterpillars
03:29:24 they're wriggly and squishy usually
03:29:26 they're big and squishy
03:29:28 they're fat and they're gross
03:29:30 we have them
03:29:32 they're slow and not a spider
03:29:34 I'm gonna throw up just thinking about them
03:29:36 we have
03:29:38 a thing where I live
03:29:40 in other places too
03:29:42 we have these things called gypsy moths
03:29:44 I wonder if you're not supposed to call them that
03:29:46 anymore
03:29:48 but yeah that's what they're called
03:29:50 and that's what everyone calls them
03:29:52 and they have
03:29:54 part of the year in trees
03:29:56 they would
03:29:58 in the corner of trees
03:30:00 in the corner of branches
03:30:02 they would have these big white masses
03:30:04 of webs of nets or whatever
03:30:06 and they would lay their eggs in there
03:30:08 and then some years
03:30:10 there would just be a big harvest of them
03:30:12 and you would just find them
03:30:14 crawling up your house's walls
03:30:16 and garage doors
03:30:18 around
03:30:20 and then they would die
03:30:22 and then you'd find their corpses all over
03:30:24 the fucking place
03:30:26 the gypsy moths are
03:30:28 particularly disgusting
03:30:30 they're not cute at all
03:30:32 but even the so called cute ones
03:30:34 I think are pretty nasty
03:30:36 and disgusting and I don't want to think about them
03:30:38 oh the gypsy moth caterpillars
03:30:40 they're kind of gross looking actually
03:30:42 they really are, they're not pleasant
03:30:44 when I was at school we had like monarch
03:30:46 caterpillars
03:30:48 we just had a plant that had a bunch of ease
03:30:50 and we would watch them and then they'd go into a cocoon
03:30:52 and we would like wait for the butterfly to come out
03:30:54 and it was really cool
03:30:56 that's pretty cool
03:30:58 yeah I mean these are in like a
03:31:00 these are not
03:31:02 they're funny, he's reaching
03:31:04 he's halo reaching
03:31:06 I would be absolutely disgusted
03:31:08 if one were on me or if I had to touch one
03:31:10 like
03:31:12 I let them crawl on my fingers
03:31:14 not the spider though
03:31:16 having long hair
03:31:18 sometimes freaks me out
03:31:20 cause like you know it touches my neck
03:31:22 and I'm like well that's my hair
03:31:24 you know I know what that feels like
03:31:26 and then occasionally like I don't know
03:31:28 a bit will like fall
03:31:30 whereas it's been balanced and it falls onto my neck
03:31:32 and I feel like something is suddenly touching my neck
03:31:34 and I'm like oh my god
03:31:36 there's something touching my neck now
03:31:38 but it's just my hair again
03:31:40 and then sometimes there is a bug
03:31:42 and I don't know what to think
03:31:44 at any moment
03:31:46 any feeling I could feel
03:31:48 could be like death
03:31:50 you will die
03:31:52 I was walking
03:31:54 this is an old story now
03:31:56 this might have been pre-COVID even
03:31:58 but I was walking around with
03:32:00 Kazi and Munchie
03:32:02 and Munchie had like a
03:32:04 he was like he like
03:32:06 jerked or moved and he was like and there was like a beetle in his hair
03:32:08 there was just like a beetle crawling around
03:32:10 in his hair or I think it was a beetle
03:32:12 or it might have been
03:32:14 it might have been like a big
03:32:16 it was some kind of like fairly large insect
03:32:18 was just like in his hair and he was like what
03:32:20 ugh and he was grossed out
03:32:22 and then like an hour later
03:32:24 there just was another one
03:32:26 there's just two of these same like
03:32:28 I think they were beetles, these black beetles
03:32:30 and he was very disturbed by this
03:32:32 because it's like how many more are there gonna be
03:32:34 I came home from the movie theater
03:32:36 recently
03:32:38 we saw a movie I think
03:32:40 actually maybe it was I don't know
03:32:42 we came home from somewhere like a week ago
03:32:44 and I just felt something tugging on my arm
03:32:46 when I moved my arm I felt something like tugging
03:32:48 and it was like restricting my
03:32:50 movement and I realized like after like
03:32:52 a minute of fumbling around it was a spider web
03:32:54 but like a really really strong one
03:32:56 like just a single thread
03:32:58 that had like wrapped itself around my body
03:33:00 it was like near invisible and I could feel it
03:33:02 and I was trying to get it off me
03:33:04 and then my husband
03:33:06 was like trying to help me and then it got stuck to him
03:33:08 and he was like what the fuck this is strong
03:33:10 and I don't know where it came from
03:33:12 but it was like a single long thread
03:33:14 that was at least like three or four meters
03:33:16 long
03:33:18 I've never had a spider web
03:33:20 thread that's like so strong that I'm like
03:33:22 oh it's pulling on me like it's
03:33:24 yeah like and I tried to like pull it
03:33:26 to break but like I guess it was also like
03:33:28 it just kind of got taught
03:33:30 it was weird
03:33:32 was it like twisted around like a rope
03:33:34 it was sort of like on my arm
03:33:36 sort of wrapped around my arm a bit
03:33:38 and then like went around the back of my chest
03:33:40 and maybe like my shoulder
03:33:42 or something and it was also like
03:33:44 sucked in my hair in some aspect
03:33:46 I was trying to get it off for like
03:33:48 a good like five minutes with one long
03:33:50 thread
03:33:52 I don't know what kind of spider would make that
03:33:54 but I never found a spider
03:33:56 there was um
03:33:58 okay funny
03:34:00 funny exterminator story
03:34:02 I was talking to my
03:34:04 Brazilian roommate
03:34:06 about the mouse we had both seen the mouse
03:34:08 and uh
03:34:10 I was relaying to him a funny factoid
03:34:12 which was that someone I knew
03:34:14 once had an exterminator
03:34:16 I think it was like a store that they worked at
03:34:18 and like an exterminator came in to like
03:34:20 do pest control and there was like
03:34:22 there was like a crab there was an ocean crab
03:34:24 like living in their basement
03:34:26 or something the exterminator had to get rid of a crab
03:34:28 that just lived there
03:34:30 for reasons that nobody knows and
03:34:32 I told him this fact and he was like
03:34:34 uh crab like what's uh
03:34:36 what's what's what's that what's a crab
03:34:38 like he didn't know the word in English and I was like
03:34:40 uh
03:34:42 I'm like trying to think how do I explain what a crab is
03:34:44 I'm like well it's you know it's in the ocean
03:34:46 it's got a shell
03:34:48 and finally I had to do the little
03:34:50 like I had to do a little crab walk
03:34:52 I had to put my hands up in little pinchers and move
03:34:54 move side to side going like huh
03:34:56 and he was like oh yeah
03:34:58 like I got it
03:35:00 I did the I had to I pantomimed it
03:35:02 and it's the universal language
03:35:04 that that that gesture
03:35:06 means crab it's in in every language
03:35:08 across the globe actually you were a crab but were you
03:35:10 crab core
03:35:12 yeah for a moment yeah just for a moment
03:35:14 I think so
03:35:16 I think I did it I pulled it off
03:35:18 uh
03:35:20 shit that's all I got to say
03:35:22 about anything I'm just gonna
03:35:24 anyone in the audience who doesn't know
03:35:26 get the crab core reference
03:35:28 I don't get it
03:35:30 oh oh my god
03:35:32 alright so when uh
03:35:34 emo like metal music was going through
03:35:36 it's like
03:35:38 weird you're like well like when metal
03:35:40 core a lot of metal core
03:35:42 music is bad
03:35:44 some of it's really good but a lot of it's bad
03:35:46 um because
03:35:48 I guess I guess
03:35:50 I guess and at the time
03:35:52 people liked the metal core bands
03:35:54 where
03:35:56 but they're like the bands where the
03:35:58 singers were like like early
03:36:00 tooth like early
03:36:02 2010s vloggers
03:36:04 hmm
03:36:06 it's just a whole band of Onesians
03:36:08 yeah look at this power stance
03:36:12 it's the double
03:36:14 doing it together at the same time with the same
03:36:16 outfit and the same hair it's just so funny
03:36:18 alright yeah they all they do all look
03:36:20 is it literally the same guy just
03:36:22 playing four instruments no they're different guys
03:36:24 they look like the same guy
03:36:30 that white gate
03:36:32 that horse um
03:36:34 straddling like legs apart
03:36:36 is that the crab
03:36:38 stance that's the crab core it's the crab stance
03:36:40 wait what's the time stamp
03:36:42 oh um it's
03:36:44 throughout the whole thing but there is like one specific
03:36:46 time stamp that's
03:36:48 like 118
03:36:50 118 is legend
03:36:52 let me see the exactly
