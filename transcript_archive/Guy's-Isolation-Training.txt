00:00:00 It is 11.25pm on Wednesday, January 4th, 2017.
00:00:26 I just got back from my 5k run. I did my nightly pull ups and I am glowing like a god. I feel
00:00:40 great. I feel really great. This is Nate's isolation training. Maybe I'll go with Guy's
00:00:51 isolation training. I don't know. I'm flip flopping between those two a lot. I haven't
00:00:56 really gotten comfortable calling myself Guy, even though I came up with it. Guys like Digi
00:01:02 and Gibb the whole time I've known them. I've called them that one name. Now it's kind of
00:01:07 funny to like Gibb change his name to Hippocrit with his new channel. It's been tough for
00:01:12 me to sort of shift with that and call him Hippo with his new name. And it's even harder
00:01:20 for me to start calling myself the new name I gave myself because I've known myself for
00:01:26 so long. So I don't know what I'll end up naming this exactly, but we'll see. Recently,
00:01:33 as I'm sure a lot of people know, I've had some things in my life that have wrapped up.
00:01:41 There have been some big changes. And now feels like a really good time to decompress,
00:01:49 you know, especially after the holidays. When I got to go home, see my folks hang out with
00:01:56 my family and see some friends from home, check in on what everybody's doing. And you know,
00:02:04 it kind of feels like it's a shift to a new chapter in my life, which, you know, if you
00:02:09 follow along with the things I say in PCP and whatnot, I'm sure that you're aware of
00:02:13 this. You know, it's kind of like, it's kind of like in my favorite game of all time, Final
00:02:20 Fantasy 15. It's like I've entered a new chapter. And the old one is getting left behind, going
00:02:30 to a new chapter, new things are happening, just like that perfect game. So I do a lot
00:02:41 of exercising. And actually, you know, we did the fat fuckery podcast recently. And I really
00:02:48 enjoyed doing that and getting to talk about, you know, my relationship with exercise and
00:02:54 dieting and that kind of stuff. I never intended to come across really as well, I probably
00:03:01 did intend to come across as like a real hardcore expert or someone who's who's incredibly
00:03:09 good at sticking to the advice that intellectually he knows is the right way to operate. Because
00:03:17 I have faults in that as well, you know, all of one, not all of, but actually the last year,
00:03:25 like, like the end of 2015 and 2016, when I moved out to Ohio for my new job. And that
00:03:32 was also the time that I was really starting to crank out heavy duty work on on my big
00:03:39 videos on best guy ever. That was a time when exercise and, you know, like health consciousness
00:03:50 definitely decreased in priority in my life, because I was so dedicated to getting those
00:03:57 videos done in all in in all my spare time was devoted to that in addition to, you know,
00:04:03 having to go to school and working full time. And then, you know, as you know, I finished
00:04:07 school, which is fantastic just a couple weeks ago. But during that time, my exercise
00:04:14 routine suffered. And there's no way around it. I gained some weight. And I lost some
00:04:21 muscle, you know, it's it's just true. I was at a peak of my life, probably around two
00:04:26 years ago, you know, before I started doing all the stuff intensely, health and fitness
00:04:32 peak of my life. It was awesome. It was wonderful. And I am definitely not at a p at that peak
00:04:39 right now. Now is the time where I'm now that I've got more time, I'm working on getting
00:04:45 back to that point, and surpassing it. But, you know, this is a lower point than that.
00:04:53 I'm no longer in a valley. I'm not at a nadir, as opposed to a zenith for you English majors
00:04:58 out there. I'm not at the lowest point. I'm currently on a rise, which feels great. But
00:05:04 you know, my point is just that I'm not perfect at this stuff, you know. And but but all this
00:05:10 is just a preface for something I wanted to talk about, which was that a guy I know, someone
00:05:17 who watches who watch this podcast, the fat fuckery podcast, somebody reached out to me
00:05:22 who had watched it. And I won't say who it is, just to protect privacy, even though,
00:05:27 I mean, I mean, if I were them, I would want this screen from the rooftops, because it's
00:05:33 so awesome. But this one guy messaged me and told me that that podcast, and specifically
00:05:41 the things I was talking about in it, were so resonated with him so strongly that he
00:05:48 was able to, I mean, I don't know if it was immediate or not, but was able to from that
00:05:53 point on, and I don't know how many months ago that was now, was able to make a change
00:05:56 in his life. And I think it was mostly dietary. And I believe he said he lost around, I don't
00:06:04 want to exaggerate, but I honestly think he said 100 pounds. I believe it was about 100
00:06:08 pounds that he lost. It might have been 50. I feel bad not remembering the exact amount.
00:06:13 But this is a math, even 50 pounds, like holy shit. And this was in the span of like, it
00:06:19 was less than six months. Let's just be conservative and say he lost 50 pounds in six months. That's
00:06:26 insane. That's fantastic. And this guy came to me and said, you know, Nate guy, whatever,
00:06:33 you really inspired me to make this change in my life. And I think he said thank you
00:06:38 or something. And you know, you know what that made me think? That made me think for
00:06:45 once in my life. I got to be the role model. I got to be, you know, the Kamina, who was
00:06:54 inspiring somebody else to be, you know, to live up to their potential, to do something
00:06:59 that they didn't necessarily know they could do. And God, Jesus Christ, I just don't know
00:07:05 if there's anything that would ever feel better than that, than to help to make a positive
00:07:10 change in someone's life like that. And obviously I'm not trying to take full credit. This,
00:07:15 this, this hero fucking did it himself. But to be a part of the process for that, you
00:07:22 know, to advocate what I would consider generally positive changes people can make in their
00:07:28 lives and to see someone follow through and succeed and be grateful and happy and better
00:07:33 and healthier for it. There's just nothing better than that. So, you know, I was just
00:07:39 out running middle of the fucking night. I got home from work, you know, had had shit
00:07:44 to do. It's fucking, it's, I should have gone to bed half an hour ago. Instead went for
00:07:50 a run. Because, you know, when it's the time of day to do your exercise, there ain't nothing
00:07:58 to it, but to do it, you know, just, just a really validating story. You know, I don't
00:08:04 even mean to talk about me. I'm just talking about the principle of, of applying yourself
00:08:07 and God, it's just, it just, it feels so good to be able to help other people to make a
00:08:13 positive change. Because that is really what my entire YouTube presence is about, at least
00:08:19 on Best Guy Ever. You know, every video I post on there, well, aside from the shit posts,
00:08:25 which there are plenty of, to be fair. All, I mean, all of like the scripted videos I
00:08:32 write, I like to think they all have a central message. And, you know, I like to cite Huey's
00:08:39 Law as I call it, the rule from the Christmas episode of the Boondocks, one of my favorite
00:08:44 shows when Huey's like, if people want to see my vision, nobody's going to give a fuck.
00:08:50 You got to dress it up with special effects and flair and songs and Hollywood movie stars.
00:08:57 You got to dress up. You got to, you got to put candy around the medicine if you want
00:09:02 people to swallow it. But I do think that there is that medicine, at least in my opinion,
00:09:08 contained in my videos that I want people to get. Because I do, I'm a really strong
00:09:15 advocate for humanism. I mean, I don't really like to attach myself to any particular movement,
00:09:20 but I just mean for, I value human life. And I want humanity to succeed and foster itself
00:09:27 and grow. And I like to think the messages that I put in my shit, you know, have that
00:09:33 effect. I mean, one of the big reasons that I wanted to do this today was because I just
00:09:38 finished my Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer video, which I was really secretive about
00:09:44 and I didn't tell anybody about until it was just about done, except Mr. Donut the Donut,
00:09:48 big shout out to him, who inspired the way that the video was edited. I wouldn't have
00:09:53 done it if I hadn't seen his Jojo videos, which I love, especially his white snake, fuckin'
00:10:00 white snake. Here I go again on my own, going down the only road I've ever known.
00:10:07 Fuckin' Enrico Pucci is my fuckin' nigga. I love that dude. Way to go, Donut, you killed
00:10:13 it. I wanted to decompress about how intense the editing process was for that. I mean,
00:10:21 there's a couple things I wanted to talk about it. Before I get into that, I've noticed that
00:10:26 I'm a really extreme guy when it comes to the way I attune myself to things, and that
00:10:34 once I'm focused on a particular task, it's really hard for me to multitask, if you know
00:10:39 what I mean, in the sense of, like, when I was getting close to finishing that video,
00:10:47 and for me, that video took about two and a half months of straight working every single
00:10:52 night editing. To be fair, Christmas vacation, I was away, so I didn't work every single
00:10:57 night, but worked many, many hours on that project. Towards the end, I'm so focused on
00:11:07 just getting it done, getting it done, gotta get it out, gotta move on to the next project.
00:11:11 Time is ticking, you have to finish it, you have to finish it, that I sort of give up
00:11:16 things like cooking myself healthy meals, because I think, no, I can't spend the time
00:11:22 doing that, I need to be editing right now, I can't waste time, I'll just fuckin' order
00:11:25 up whatever. Fuckin' Crangoonz. That's Crab Rangoonz, there was a Chinese food menu
00:11:33 at my house that said Crangoonz on it, I've always loved that. Fuckin' Crangoonz, dawg!
00:11:41 Have you ever seen me buy me some Crangoonz? I'll love you forever. Yeah, like why would
00:11:48 I spend time cooking myself a fuckin' healthy meal, making my delicious protein shake, that'll
00:11:52 take up two whole minutes of my life, I could be editing, just fuckin' order something, or
00:11:57 spend an hour exercising, really, when I could spend that hour, you know, photoshopping fucking
00:12:03 two panels from this fuckin' massive project I'm doing right now, I can't justify that
00:12:09 time, I need to be editing right now, you know, like that's the way my mind goes, and
00:12:13 I've noticed this pattern, you know, I talked before about how my exercise routine has suffered,
00:12:20 you know, for a while it's suffered, you know, it's better now, but it's suffered because
00:12:24 I would trick myself sort of, my mind would play tricks on itself to make me think that
00:12:29 oh, I can't exercise today, I need to fucking be editing right now, you know, my ability
00:12:37 to divide up my time in a healthy way diminishes as my urgency to complete a project increases,
00:12:45 you know what I mean? I've noticed that, you know, ever since, even since the first
00:12:49 Guren Logan video, Guren Logan part one, you know how I edited that thing, I would, I was
00:12:54 using my old laptop for that, and I went to the library where my parents wouldn't bug
00:12:59 me, because I was living at home and I was making it on my shitty fucking laptop, and
00:13:03 I would go to the library and sit down there all night and just edit clips together on
00:13:08 that piece of shit laptop that barely even worked, you know, I didn't even know that
00:13:11 Vegas, I was watching clips in like full resolution, and I didn't turn down the, like the little
00:13:20 preview window to like quarter resolution, which allows you to actually play it properly,
00:13:24 so I was just fucking like, I would have to render a clip and then watch it to see if
00:13:29 the timing worked, it's fucking whatever. The point is, like, all my time was just spent
00:13:35 at that fucking library editing, that's what I did, and my, my, you know, exercise routine
00:13:40 suffered, and then once that project was done, oh, I was free, and you know, I could start
00:13:44 preparing to work on part two, and then, you know, my exercise routine got way better,
00:13:47 got much better again, and you know, that was just the start of this, but now I've been
00:13:52 doing these intensive editing projects straight for almost two years, like a year and a half,
00:13:58 or so, and it's, it's not a good cycle of, of like managing the important things I need
00:14:08 to do in my life, you know, I, I've given up a lot of other things to focus on editing,
00:14:14 and I'm aware that it's having negative effects in other aspects of my life in various ways,
00:14:19 but those are all acceptable to me, but the exercise one is not acceptable to me, and
00:14:25 that's why I, I need to make some changes in the way that I, that I structure my time,
00:14:30 you know, I really feel like The Procrastinators is the perfect channel for me, because I have
00:14:36 never met anyone, you can talk to my friends, I have never met anyone who is a worst procrastinator
00:14:42 in the sense that you get things done generally, but at the absolute last possible second,
00:14:50 are you aware, of course you're not aware, I've never, I don't talk about this, but
00:14:56 I finished all my assignments this last semester as a fucking, you know, super senior guy finishing
00:15:04 my degree in my last class here, every single assignment was turned in the hour it was due
00:15:12 or later, or later than the due date, and luckily, like in this particular class they
00:15:18 didn't mind, but I've had classes where people did mind, and then, you know, then you have
00:15:24 to play the whole dance of like, oh I'm so sorry, like, oh I thought it was due late,
00:15:28 like I've been a real shitty, you know, time management guy as long as I can remember,
00:15:36 and it's my biggest flaw personally, and it stretches into other ways, you know, like,
00:15:43 I think that it's the same problem that I have with my ability to, you know, like budget
00:15:48 when I get close to the end of an editing project, like how much time I need to be editing,
00:15:52 and then, you know, Nate, take the fucking hour to go exercise, you know, I think that
00:15:57 these are all a manifestation of the same, same kind of weakness of, you know, an ability
00:16:03 to structure a schedule effectively, I'm really a one track kind of guy, which by the way
00:16:10 makes me a great editor, as everybody can see, because I so autistically focus in on
00:16:18 whatever I've decided is the thing that I have to do, and when it's done, generally
00:16:24 pretty fucking good, but, you know, it comes at a cost, you know, other shit gets neglected,
00:16:29 I really am a, you know, an artist in the sense that I need a rich, gay, Italian lover
00:16:37 slash patron to, to be my patron as an artist, so we can have gay sex, you know, like I'm
00:16:49 referencing Michelangelo, if you're not getting the reference here, and the Pope, I think
00:16:55 they were gay lovers, right, that's fact that's confirmed, yeah, I'm pretty sure that's confirmed.
00:17:01 You know, if I can just focus on the thing that I want to do, I'm pretty darn good at
00:17:05 it, if I, if I do say so myself, hey quick aside, when I was out on my run today, I found
00:17:11 not one, but two potatoes on the ground, and I'm holding them in my hands, they are completely
00:17:18 frozen solid, how's that for focus, fuck boys, where's I going with that, whatever, not important,
00:17:29 oh yeah, I'm just decompressing about the whole, my whole experience of YouTubeing and
00:17:33 making the Biscuit Hammer video, you know, it's really, it's revealing to me more and
00:17:39 more the way that I operate on YouTube, and the ways that that isn't optimal, you know,
00:17:46 I've talked about this many times, I think in various PCP episodes, so I'm, I don't
00:17:51 need to dwell on it too much, but that project was a vast sinkhole of time, two and a half
00:17:59 months, that, you know, just isn't the most efficient way to spend your time on YouTube,
00:18:07 not to mention, it's a niche thing, like it's a, it's a fucking AMV, you know, an MMV
00:18:13 I guess, Manga Music Video, for a series that's not particularly popular, but you know, I,
00:18:22 I just really identify with it, hey you know what sucks about that, that I want everyone
00:18:27 to die, who says this, everyone who fucking comments on that video, wow, great video dude,
00:18:32 or even, or it just skips that part and gets straight to, you guys should read Spirit Circle,
00:18:37 Spirit Circle is the latest manga by Satoshi Mizukami, the guy who made Lucifer and the
00:18:42 Biscuit Hammer, we're not here to talk about fucking Spirit Circle, you fucking idiots,
00:18:47 we're here to talk about Lucifer and the fucking Biscuit Hammer, everyone who fucking commented
00:18:51 about Spirit Circle, shut the fuck up and die, I hate you guys, I don't hate you guys,
00:18:57 I just wish you would focus on the matter at hand, I didn't make a fucking video about
00:19:02 Spirit Circle, okay, I made a video about Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer, because it's one
00:19:07 of my favorite manga, and Spirit Circle, I've read about half of it, okay, it does not focus,
00:19:13 it's not like these things are interchangeable, like oh if you like, if you like Lucifer and
00:19:16 the Biscuit Hammer, just read Spirit Circle, like it's, it's, it's the new one, so it
00:19:20 just replaces it, no, that's fucking not how it works, Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer
00:19:24 is fucking great, and I wish you fucking people talking about Spirit Circle, we just make
00:19:28 your own fucking Spirit Circle video, and then comment all your shit on that, okay,
00:19:32 just keep it off of my shit, god damn it, god, Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer is too
00:19:39 good to be ignored by discussions about fucking the new work by the guy, okay, I like Spirit
00:19:46 Circle, it's, it's, it's good, I haven't finished it, I can't say that it's great, because
00:19:50 I haven't gotten, I don't know, I don't feel like it's really earned, it's, it's, it's
00:19:54 weight yet, as like, you know, because I love this series, I don't feel like it's reached
00:19:59 that bar with the place I got to, I don't, I don't know how far I got into it, I'm lying,
00:20:03 I didn't get halfway, I just, I read like, I don't know, 20 chapters or something, just
00:20:10 everybody chill out about Spirit Circle, okay, can we please, you know, the biggest disappointment
00:20:14 for me about that, about that video is that there isn't more, and you know, to be fair,
00:20:18 I get it, I understand why, because it's the nature of the video, it's kind of just a,
00:20:24 a really quick, emotional dive into Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer, as opposed to like,
00:20:30 what I, what I'm tempted to do, because I'm not getting enough of this, but like a, you
00:20:34 know, like my Tengentubba girl log in part two, I would, I'd like to do a, someday I
00:20:37 probably won't, but maybe I will, Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer, part two video, where
00:20:41 I like, really talk in depth about the themes of the, of the manga, and what it means, and
00:20:47 why it's so important to me as a person, because that is a very important series to me as
00:20:52 a person, really, oh god, it, it doesn't really come across that much in the, in the video
00:20:59 that I made, there's, there's so much about that series that I couldn't capture, that
00:21:03 oh, it, you know, you know, it's like, no matter what AMV you make of any show, or any manga,
00:21:09 you're never going to capture everything that you love about it.
00:21:12 And just one of the things I couldn't capture about that series was, in the video, you do
00:21:16 see Amamiya's, or Yuhi's transformation from like his self-hating, you know, kind of an
00:21:23 asshole weirdo creeper who wouldn't mind if the world got destroyed into, you know, like
00:21:29 a guy who lives for his lady, has real genuine friendships with people, you know, has father
00:21:36 figures that come and go, and is able to make a positive contribution to the world emotionally
00:21:41 and practically, by fucking, you know, saving the fucking world, fuck yeah, Lizard Knight,
00:21:46 but it's, there's this other part about him, there, there's a lot of physical training
00:21:50 that goes on in that series, I was fucking out running today, Amamiya Yuhi goes out running
00:21:56 every single morning with the princess, every day, in Lucifer and the Biscayne Hammer, they
00:22:00 go for a fucking run, alright, and it's to build up their stamina, because their, their
00:22:05 ring power is the domain control, psychic power, ball things that you don't see much
00:22:09 of in my video, those, the more stamina you have, the more endurance you have, like the
00:22:14 stronger your domain is, like the longer you can use it, and also, later on in the series,
00:22:18 he gets, I wish I really tried to include this, there just wasn't enough space, Yuhi
00:22:23 gets really into digging holes, like he just, out of the blue, out of the fucking blue,
00:22:29 he develops the habit of digging trap holes all over this fucking mountain, and he starts
00:22:35 doing it, and he gets fucking ripped, just he goes out every day, and he digs fucking
00:22:40 holes, just like, you know, like the movie holes, only he covers them up, and it's used
00:22:46 for fucking like emotional payoffs, as well as gags, like the idea is that he'll dig holes
00:22:53 to, you know, get stronger, it's his form of exercise, as well as, it's a meditative
00:22:58 thing, it's an exercise thing, and it's also a practical, you know, like trap hole, like
00:23:02 when they're fighting the golems, maybe one will step in one, and it'll, you know, help
00:23:06 them in the fight somehow, and God, I fucking love it, but, but it's the training that Yuhi
00:23:11 goes through, oh God, I just love, you know, you know, guys, I want me at Yuhi, he starts
00:23:17 that series, the weakest fuck, right, me, I started running seriously about four or five
00:23:24 months ago, I think after, I had gone for a long time, I'd still been working out sparingly,
00:23:32 but I got, I got really into running again, and now I'm doing 5Ks pretty frequently, and
00:23:36 I'm going for 10K, just like, even though that's, even if a 5K is not that impressive,
00:23:42 but, well, let me put it in context, when I started running a couple months ago, like
00:23:46 my ankles, and I had never felt this before, because I used to run a lot, but my ankles
00:23:51 were so weak, they were like the limiting factor when I tried to go for a run, like
00:23:55 as I would be out running, I wouldn't get exhausted, my ankles would specifically give
00:24:00 out, like when you're doing curls, and your bicep gives out, and you just can't do another
00:24:03 fucking curl, my ankles would just, I couldn't lift my leg to, or, you know, to move my fucking
00:24:09 foot to run anymore, that was the limiting factor on them, it was, it was weird, I had
00:24:14 never felt that before, but now, several months later, no problems, my ankles are totally
00:24:19 fine, and that was like a real problem for like a month when I was running, but God,
00:24:23 it feels so good to set yourself a goal like that, and to achieve it, to get past it, which
00:24:31 is why I fucking love exercising, I feel so good, every time I exercise when I'm doing
00:24:37 it, it's hard, doesn't, don't really love the actual doing of it, but afterward, feels
00:24:43 fantastic, and you know what, I do love doing it, like every set is a struggle, obviously,
00:24:48 but once you put the set down, and you can just bask in what you've just accomplished,
00:24:52 ugh, it's great, everyone, I hope everyone feels it, ugh, boy, a little bit rambly, hope
00:25:00 you forgive me, I feel like everything here is fairly related, more or less, you know,
00:25:04 in the same ballpark here, is there anything else I wanted to say about my fucking video
00:25:08 there, no, no, I guess I'm a little disappointed with the views, I mean, you know, my channel
00:25:15 is not that big, I understand, I knew from the get-go that that video wasn't, you know,
00:25:22 it's not like I was making a drama video, now that's what I need to do to get the views,
00:25:27 it's a little art piece, you know, I think that my patrons probably appreciate it a lot,
00:25:33 because it's the, I feel like it's new content for me, and it's a whole new fucking art form
00:25:37 that I've never done before, and I really loved it, thanks again Mr. Donut for inspiring
00:25:42 it, yeah, I don't know, I just think that my particular brand on Best Guy Ever is gonna
00:25:47 grow as time goes on fairly, I mean, if I kept doing what I had been doing, it'd be slow,
00:25:54 but I think I'm gonna make a couple changes, hopefully it'll go faster, we'll see, hopefully
00:25:58 the quality will remain high, I mean, it's me, come on son, you know I'm gonna be high
00:26:02 quality, yeah, I guess there's one other thing I kind of wanted to talk about that relates
00:26:10 to some of the stuff I've been saying here, I was just thinking about the kind of characters
00:26:15 I gravitate to a lot, I don't know how much, I know I've talked about this to some extent
00:26:21 in PCPs, but you know, I was just thinking about Kill Bill, the bride, you know, the
00:26:28 snake boys, that whole bunch, nah, but really I was thinking about Bill, Bill himself, there's
00:26:36 a line in Kill Bill, it's not really a line, it's just a concept about the character Bill
00:26:41 that someone says, I think Esteban, whatever, the Spanish dude, Mexican, I don't know, the
00:26:48 guy that is in Kill Bill part two, who tells the bride where Bill is finally, what's her
00:26:54 name, Beatrix Kiddo, that's right, when Kiddo goes to meet this guy, he was like a mentor
00:27:01 of Bill's growing up, and I don't really know exactly what their relationship was, but they
00:27:05 hung out, you know, and he says something interesting about Bill that's really stuck
00:27:08 with me over the years, and it was that, I think he said that Bill and his brother Bud
00:27:14 were orphans, I think he said that, but I know he definitely said, Bill collected father
00:27:20 figures, ever since I heard that line, I just felt such a strong kinship with that, you
00:27:27 know, I don't know if everybody gets that, but I know exactly what that means, and I
00:27:33 mean maybe Bill didn't have a father, and that's why he, you know, quote unquote collected
00:27:38 father figures, but I really feel like that sort of idea is why I'm so into anime, and
00:27:44 the specific things that I gravitate towards, you know, I of course have a dad, and he is
00:27:52 a wonderful dad, and I love him with all my heart, but he's not perfect, you know, no
00:27:59 dad is, my dad is a very emotionally, I don't know, I don't want to paint him in the wrong
00:28:07 way, you know, like a lot of the time, mothers are the more emotional person, I think between
00:28:13 two parents, at least it seemed to me, and fathers are a little bit more, I mean not
00:28:18 even that they're more disciplined, but they're more, they're more like a teacher, you know,
00:28:22 as opposed to a friend, you know what I mean, a little more strict, you know, and my dad,
00:28:28 you know, was kind of strict, I guess, but my dad was definitely the more emotional one,
00:28:32 I hope I'm not fucking going too deep right now, too real, but whatever, I don't think
00:28:37 I'm going to say anything that's going to hurt anybody's feelings, my dad was definitely
00:28:40 the more emotionally connected of my two parents, you know, my dad's a psychologist, so I'm
00:28:45 sure empathy is his fucking business, you know, it's his deal to connect emotionally
00:28:52 and do that shit, and my mom is just, you know, I don't even, I don't want to say emotionally
00:28:57 distant, that sounds negative, I just mean that she was a little more, you know, private
00:29:02 of a person, and she was always there for me when I was real sad, and when I needed somebody,
00:29:08 but it's just not really in her nature to, like, what I'm trying to illustrate here is
00:29:13 just that I think when I was growing up, and this has a point, this relates to anime, your
00:29:17 favorite thing viewer, so hang in there, I think when I was growing up, like, I didn't
00:29:27 have anybody who was like really cool in my life, you know, like I don't think I had a
00:29:34 strong positive male role model in the sense of like a badass, you know, like my dad was
00:29:44 a wonderful father, a fantastic person, but I wouldn't exactly call him a badass, and
00:29:50 actually it's really funny, as I've gotten older, and I learn more about his history,
00:29:55 and I see him spend more time with like his brothers, because he's got a whole bunch of
00:29:57 brothers, and I see him do things that I don't think he would have showed when I was younger,
00:30:01 I see like the badass part of my dad come out more and more, which is kind of ironic,
00:30:05 as he gets older, he gets more of a badass, at least in my eyes, but like there wasn't
00:30:10 as much of that when I was young, and I'm not trying to complain, I'm just describing
00:30:14 reality for me, this is not a complaint, but when I look back at the guy that I am now,
00:30:20 and why I am this way, I do think that I didn't have someone in my life who I could emulate
00:30:28 to be cool, you know, and being cool is so important to me, and it's not that I choose
00:30:37 that I want that for myself, it's kind of just instinct, and it's not even that I really
00:30:42 think that I am that cool, it's that I want to be cool, and so I project that I think
00:30:48 I am cool, oh god we're getting deep here, this is a little more than I bargained for,
00:30:55 fuck it, fuck it, so what I'm trying to say is, I think I filled that hole in myself,
00:31:02 and hey for all I know, everyone in the world feels exactly the same, you know, maybe everyone
00:31:06 can relate to this, I'm not trying to say I'm the only one who felt like this, because
00:31:09 I had a great life growing up, but everyone's got things that are deficient, you know, excesses
00:31:15 of some things, deficiencies of others, in my case, I think I could have used some more
00:31:20 like positive male role models, because I had my brother around, but he's not cool, you
00:31:29 know Ben was cool, but I don't know, I think we were too much alike, oh man I don't even
00:31:36 know what Ben's place in my life was, we hung out a lot, I don't know, I can't even comment
00:31:42 on it, I just gotta skip over that and just say what I'm actually trying to fucking get
00:31:45 to, which is that I think anime, cartoons, Goku filled that role model for me, filled
00:31:54 that hole in my life, of like, I didn't have a person in my life like a dad or an uncle
00:32:02 who would fucking talk to me about like, oh man, you wanna look at all those sexy girls,
00:32:11 you know, or like, hey let's go hunting, let's go kill things, let's go be beasts, let's
00:32:17 go be animals for a while, you know, I wasn't in touch with my reptilian brain very much
00:32:23 when I was younger, I don't think, I don't think I was really like aware that it's okay
00:32:29 to just be a fucking animal sometimes, you know, and I think I have tried to make up
00:32:35 for that in other ways, but that's why I think I feel so attracted to characters like, like
00:32:41 when I was young, Goku man, Goku was my dude, he's why I started exercising all those years
00:32:48 ago and I've been doing it ever since with varying degrees of success, man you should
00:32:53 see some of my pictures at my sexiest, oh it was a fucking god, but give me a couple
00:32:58 months, I'll be back in top shape, I just need to do a little more running, anyway when
00:33:03 I was young, Goku was my hero, it's funny because think about it now, really Vegeta
00:33:10 is the guy that I relate to way more, like fucking Vegeta dude, like prince of all sayings
00:33:17 right, fucking planet gets blown up, alright, his kingdom gone, his people gone, like who's
00:33:26 gonna be sadder about a fucking planet being destroyed, like Goku, some fuckboy who doesn't
00:33:31 even know that other fucking Kakaradians exist, other fucking sayings exist, or the fucking
00:33:38 prince of all sayings who was gonna rule over his people and they all fucking died, right,
00:33:43 bam, sadder backstory, trains so hard all the time to be the best, and still, fucking power
00:33:52 friendship Goku just beats him every god damn time, and of course like being fucking crushed
00:34:00 under the superior alphaness of Frieza his whole life, the guy who killed his dad until
00:34:08 you know fucking Goku saves him, the man who defeated him, god and he can still never surpass
00:34:13 Goku, why is Goku the legendary Super Saiyan, why not me, I'm the fucking prince, I'm just
00:34:18 trying to describe how hard Vegeta worked, right, and how what a raw deal he fucking got his whole
00:34:23 life, until he finally found peace and settled down with a top shelf babe like Bulma, had a
00:34:28 kick ass son like Future Trunks, holy shit, fuck yeah, love Trunks, love Vegeta, love Bulma,
00:34:35 perfect family, 10 out of 10, man, but anyway when I was a kid I didn't understand that,
00:34:42 I didn't know what a real nigga Vegeta was, I was into Goku, because Goku's still trained hard,
00:34:48 you know, he worked hard and he played hard, oh god I've gone too far
00:34:59 but Goku was the hero right, Goku was the dude who fucking saved the day, he was the strongest,
00:35:06 he was the coolest, everything revolved around him, he was the most important character,
00:35:10 everyone respected him, everyone loved him, I wanted to be him, I wanted to be him so bad,
00:35:15 I wanted to be him more than anything else in the world, and I think at the time I worked out
00:35:22 specifically to be like Goku, to be a hero is why I worked out, I think that I can say that
00:35:30 with some confidence, that is why I started working out when I was a little kid, I mean I
00:35:35 wasn't that little at that point, I mean I was probably like, I don't even fucking know, long
00:35:39 time ago, yeah I wanted to be Goku, and I see that pattern in different ways, as I got older,
00:35:47 you know, like the whole girl thing became more relevant, because when I was young, man, brother,
00:35:53 brothers and sisters, I was uncomfortable with the ladies, let me tell you, I had opportunities man,
00:36:03 I had him, goofed him up, goofed him up, and that's why I was so attracted to characters like,
00:36:12 you know, like Kamina, my favorite character, the women loved him, and the men wanted to be him,
00:36:20 and I was one of them, he had Yoko, he would have had his pick of the litter, you know,
00:36:27 he was a hero, he was a leader, that is the exact kind of person I wanted to be, and
00:36:33 you know, I definitely was not, I definitely was not that guy, for a long time,
00:36:40 and I wanted to be more than anything, and you know, I think I'm closer than I've ever been
00:36:47 to being like a Kamina, I mean hey, I fucking, right, my story earlier, inspiring someone to
00:36:54 exercise, work out, and get some real change in their life, that's what it's all about man,
00:37:00 it really, it really touches me that I could, I could do that, I could have that kind of positive
00:37:06 change in somebody's life, so you know what, I mean things are looking up right, things are
00:37:10 looking up, I'm just talking about how I relate to that line in fucking Kill Bill, you know,
00:37:19 he collected father figures, I collected father figures too, I think, and I, it's guys like
00:37:27 Vash the Stampede, who just go above and beyond the fucking call of duty to protect people,
00:37:35 and their superior, and their gods, you know, like Vash is a fucking god, and he uses his
00:37:41 power to connect with humanity, to have a good life, you know, fucking fuck sluts, like a real guy,
00:37:48 and though he's actually, he's a sensitive soul, he would never take advantage of a woman like that,
00:37:53 because he doesn't want them to see his fucked up body, because he spends all day
00:37:56 helping, protecting people, guys like, I mean to some extent, Rance from Sengoku Rance,
00:38:04 and the whole, the whole Rance series, love, love him, big admirer of his work,
00:38:11 go look up Sengoku Rance if you don't know what it is, play that fucking game, it's awesome,
00:38:15 story aside, the gameplay is hard as fuck, love that game, love that game, I don't know, I think
00:38:21 I just wanted to talk about why I'm into anime at all, you know, I'm not like, I'm not like a lot
00:38:28 of the other guys on YouTube who talk about anime, who really give a shit about anime as a medium,
00:38:36 for me, anime is just sort of the medium that life led me to, that happened to most appeal
00:38:44 to the things I'm into, like, there aren't a lot of communas outside anime, you know what I mean?
00:38:54 You don't see a lot of that shit these days, strong, positive male role models are a big thing
00:39:01 that I like to see, you know, I love good dads, you know, I say that sometimes, I really love
00:39:08 good dads, infection, I don't know man, I'm gonna have to listen back to this and see if this is
00:39:17 even worthy of being shipped out, this may have gotten too real, too fast, and too furious for you,
00:39:28 and for public consumption, anyway, I think that's about everything I've got to say,
00:39:35 I might delete this, might upload the whole thing, might edit some shit out,
00:39:40 maybe I'll add another piece, I don't know, we'll see, but hey everybody out there, before you go,
00:39:46 just remember, go do cool shit that's hard, but you want to do anyway, because if you do it,
00:39:55 because I told you to, and then you tell me about it, I'll feel really good about that,
00:40:02 and so go do that, so I can feel good about myself, all right, I demand you make positive
00:40:09 changes in your life, so that I can feel better about myself, all right, there you go, there's
00:40:15 your ultimatum, don't do that or I'll, I don't know, your mother will die under sleep tonight,
00:40:19 all right, thanks for listening everybody, I'll see you later.
