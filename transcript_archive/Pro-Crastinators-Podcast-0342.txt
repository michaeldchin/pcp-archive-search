00:00:00 I won't bless that guy that son of a bitch.
00:00:11 Hello, I'm the Angry Video Game Nerd.
00:00:16 And I'm the Nostalgia Critic.
00:00:18 And together we are...
00:00:20 These farce floor on the mic.
00:00:22 These Nostalgia Video Game Nerd Critics.
00:00:25 Yeah, it's 2023.
00:00:30 Yes, Happy New Year, Merry Christmas.
00:00:32 We didn't make an episode a week ago.
00:00:37 And you're just going to have to deal with it.
00:00:40 Because we were both...
00:00:42 Well, you were traveling. I was also kind of traveling.
00:00:45 We just like...
00:00:46 It was like already Tuesday past the Sunday we were supposed to record.
00:00:50 And we were like, when can we record?
00:00:54 And it didn't want to.
00:00:56 We would have had...
00:00:57 Like if we had the Nostalgia...
00:00:59 It would have been on Christmas Day we recorded the episode.
00:01:02 And it was like, I don't want to do that.
00:01:03 And I don't want to do the day after or the day after.
00:01:05 Because I got stuff done.
00:01:07 And they don't want to do the next week on New Year's.
00:01:10 So here we are on the second.
00:01:13 January 2nd.
00:01:15 Yes.
00:01:18 Almost the anniversary of my favorite holiday.
00:01:21 January 6th.
00:01:23 January 6th.
00:01:26 It's not as funny as 9-11.
00:01:28 They're going to do it again?
00:01:29 No, it's not as funny as 9-11.
00:01:31 No.
00:01:33 9-11 has a better ring to it as well.
00:01:35 But then again, yeah.
00:01:37 But then again, you know what it is.
00:01:39 What could ever be?
00:01:41 Oh, shit.
00:01:42 I shouldn't say 9-11 in the first two minutes of the episode.
00:01:45 They'll catch that.
00:01:47 They'll catch it.
00:01:50 Okay, so I guess how was your Christmas?
00:01:53 Okay, so that's it.
00:01:54 Now let's go to the one-piece recap.
00:01:56 I mean, we want to talk about that.
00:01:58 That's cool.
00:01:59 It's very cool right now.
00:02:00 It's so cool right now.
00:02:02 I'm so glad I got back into it when I did.
00:02:04 Because everything else sucks except for the current arc,
00:02:08 which is good.
00:02:09 Yeah.
00:02:10 The end.
00:02:12 My Christmas.
00:02:14 Yeah.
00:02:15 What the fuck happened?
00:02:17 Let me briefly explain the logistics of my Christmas.
00:02:19 So, all right.
00:02:21 Now, I, like many of you,
00:02:23 have a mother and a father.
00:02:26 Oh my god.
00:02:27 Yeah.
00:02:28 So, you know, I got two sides of the family.
00:02:32 So on like the 17th,
00:02:36 my dad's side of the family usually does a Christmas Eve celebration.
00:02:41 And we'd had to do that early this year
00:02:43 because one of my cousins was going somewhere
00:02:46 and some uncles wanted to visit him or something.
00:02:48 So we did it early and that was fine.
00:02:52 And then I did like a family thing.
00:02:57 My, you know, my Nate and my sister were not in town.
00:03:03 So my Christmas Christmas was just me and my parents,
00:03:07 which was, you know, fine.
00:03:09 And then my mom's side of the family usually
00:03:14 does a New Year's Day, get together.
00:03:16 And so yesterday I got on a train
00:03:19 and I went to go to Connecticut to go and see them.
00:03:24 And that was okay.
00:03:25 A lot of these people I haven't seen in ages and ages.
00:03:29 And, you know, that was all, that was fine too.
00:03:33 But I'm sort of relieved that it's all done.
00:03:36 Yes.
00:03:37 Because it's sort of a lot of work.
00:03:40 It is.
00:03:41 Traveling different times.
00:03:44 It's funny how like Christmas is like a moment of cheer
00:03:49 and everything and like, oh, it's a holiday.
00:03:52 It's a time off.
00:03:53 But it's like the most stressful, like work-intensive holiday.
00:03:57 It's actually much harder than just normal living.
00:04:01 If you think about it.
00:04:02 There's all sorts of events that you can't,
00:04:04 you just have to plan around and people you got to see
00:04:08 and you got to say hi.
00:04:09 I mean, I don't dislike saying hi to relatives.
00:04:12 No.
00:04:13 I just don't like getting in a car and driving somewhere
00:04:15 or going on a train or getting up early.
00:04:17 I don't like any of those things.
00:04:19 I'm less bothered by it than I used to be.
00:04:24 But I still don't really love, you know,
00:04:27 I got to spend my, got to use my day to do,
00:04:29 got to do that with my day.
00:04:31 And then I got to like prepare for it.
00:04:34 Rather just.
00:04:36 And I got to like make myself look normal.
00:04:38 Like I can't look like a freak.
00:04:40 Right.
00:04:41 Right.
00:04:42 That's the whole thing.
00:04:43 I mean, not, not that hard.
00:04:46 Not that, not that hard in my case, but the.
00:04:49 Oh, very hard for me.
00:04:51 I know.
00:04:52 I know.
00:04:53 Some of us have a, some of us are,
00:04:55 what's the phrase?
00:04:56 A normally, normally challenged thing.
00:05:05 What did I get for Christmas?
00:05:07 I got an immersion blender.
00:05:09 Immersion.
00:05:11 Imm, in bur, an in burgeon blender.
00:05:14 It's the, it's the kind of blender.
00:05:16 It's like a, it's on a long stick and you put it down into like a fluid and you blend,
00:05:21 you stick it into the liquid to blend with rather than,
00:05:24 rather than putting like stuff into a blender and blending it inside of the blender.
00:05:29 Like it's a weapon.
00:05:30 You could use that to get someone.
00:05:32 Yes.
00:05:33 You, you, you thrust it like a, like a fencing saber at your opponent.
00:05:37 And it blends whatever part of it strikes.
00:05:40 Could you, could you drill inside of a watermelon and then blend it from the inside?
00:05:47 No, it has to be, it has to be liquid.
00:05:50 It has to at least be mostly liquid.
00:05:53 Hmm.
00:05:54 Then what's the point?
00:05:56 Sorry, there is none.
00:05:58 What's the point of anything?
00:05:59 You know, my sister got me gummy molds, shaped like skulls.
00:06:06 So that's cool.
00:06:07 Hell yeah.
00:06:08 Hell yeah.
00:06:10 I'll put drugs in those ones.
00:06:13 No gummies.
00:06:14 Just drugs.
00:06:15 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:06:16 Just hard press, like cocaine dust.
00:06:18 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:06:23 I'll probably think of some other things at some point.
00:06:26 One or two other, like kind of neat things.
00:06:30 Okay.
00:06:31 What about you?
00:06:32 What was your-
00:06:33 My stupid holiday.
00:06:35 It was much of the same. I also have people with sides of families
00:06:40 I went to see actually only want to see my mom's side of the family this year
00:06:45 That's how the family you know doing all this stuff. I admit most years
00:06:49 I will often just only see my dad's side of the family
00:06:51 That's why I had been so long since I'd seen my mom's side in a lot of cases
00:06:55 Which I feel kind of bad about cuz like they're just as valid, you know, they're just as valid. Yeah, and they miss me
00:07:02 You know, they they've been denied. They've been denied and my presence. They've been denied my presence
00:07:08 You know, I feel I feel I feel bad
00:07:09 I feel bad because because it had been so long since I'd seen some of them
00:07:13 I felt a bit awkward, you know, I try I talked to a bunch of them
00:07:16 But a lot of you know, I think I was more quiet and I think I ended up talking less
00:07:22 Overall to the that side of the family that I had seen less of even though I kind of needed to do more catching up with them
00:07:29 Yeah
00:07:32 Yeah, it's this a classic like
00:07:35 So
00:07:36 First of all, who are you? I don't recognize you. You don't want to say that and then right?
00:07:41 What have you been up to? Oh the last 10 years of your life. That's a lot to talk about. Yeah
00:07:46 It's like you don't want you don't want to approach that they don't want to approach that so you just sort of nod
00:07:52 Yeah, yeah, I mean, that's that's exactly that's exactly what happened
00:07:58 Well, what are you gonna do? Yeah
00:08:01 I'm it's it's got to a point for my family stuff. We're like
00:08:07 There are younger children around. Yeah, and like some of them are cousins
00:08:14 Mm-hmm. Like like you formally apologize to
00:08:20 To deadly comics on the last episode. He said that your cousin's kid is your
00:08:27 Cousin once removed and I said it's your second cousin. He was right. I was wrong
00:08:33 Yes, cuz it's yeah, I still I can't wrap my head around it because the names are too similar
00:08:40 It actually it actually makes sense. Okay, imagine you have
00:08:44 One common ancestor and then they have two kids and those are siblings
00:08:48 And then if you step one rung down like each of those siblings has a child
00:08:53 Those are cousins and then if you if those cousins have kids
00:08:57 Those are second cousins and then if those cousins have kids those are third cousins
00:09:02 So if they if they are on the same rung of the
00:09:05 Generational ladder, they are first second third fourth fifth cousins
00:09:09 But then if like if if you're talking about one generation removed like your second cousin's father is your is your second
00:09:18 second cousin once removed and your your second cousin's son is your second cousin wait
00:09:25 You've lost me no, you're you're your
00:09:29 No, it'd be your uncle you're your cousin your second cousin's
00:09:33 Father is your second uncle once removed and your second and your second cousin's son
00:09:40 He is your second cousin set he is your second cousin once removed
00:09:44 But but he but you are his second uncle. No, he's your second nephew fuck. Oh, no
00:09:52 See, I think I think the person the nerd who came up with all these terms didn't even have a family
00:09:57 They were just fantasizing about they were they were just thinking about what if they were just thinking
00:10:01 I wouldn't it be funny if I made it up
00:10:03 named like this
00:10:05 Nobody else had even thought to try
00:10:08 But oh, yeah, that was the thing that the young kids in because I was usually the youngest cousin there
00:10:14 and then one of my uncles finally had children and
00:10:18 Now there are cousins who are in my same like quote-unquote generation
00:10:24 They're first cousins, but they're like they're like 10. I see
00:10:29 They played pumpkin alley. We had they had their laptops there and they played the video game
00:10:35 Oh made shit. Did you did you like tell them about it there and they were like, oh shit
00:10:40 You made a video game. Can we play it? Yeah, and that was that was really nice
00:10:44 That was a really nice moment cuz they loved it. They really got into it and they
00:10:48 It was really gratifying and and and stuff seeing them play
00:10:52 And like was like figure out the controls was Henry there
00:10:57 He was too out of it. I think to want to go
00:11:02 It's a long drive. Oh, okay, so you're younger cousins were into it. That is pretty cool
00:11:08 That is pretty cool. And I watched them like figure out
00:11:12 How to play the game like they got stuck in places and then he walked around like what do you do?
00:11:17 Oh wait, and then they saw like I mean the part of the level that I had made
00:11:21 Like just deliberately to like guide them towards the solution and they figured it out and it's like, ah, yes
00:11:26 Level design. I did it. It worked. Are you 10 year olds can understand pumpkin alley?
00:11:32 That's pretty good. If you if you're 10 years old right now, are you a zoomer?
00:11:37 Or are you whatever comes after zoomers? I
00:11:39 mean, I
00:11:41 I don't know what the I think generations are like vague. So like yeah, sure I
00:11:47 Would assume the generation that comes after zoomers is ones that are born of zoomers
00:11:54 So this is the new generation. No, no, it's not quite that the generations like
00:12:02 Millennials parents are boomers and
00:12:06 And
00:12:07 Like gen gen Z's parents are our gen Xers. So it kind of like skips one. I think right
00:12:15 So I feel like the zoomers are like 20 now
00:12:20 Zoomers are like are like teens and 20 now
00:12:23 But I'm only like I'm not even 30 yet. So like I
00:12:27 Guess I'm on the cusp of zoomer and millennial maybe
00:12:31 I'm like a late millennial. I think you're
00:12:35 Yeah, yeah, that sounds about right
00:12:40 Anyway, I just whatever I was I all I wanted to ask was like I just wanted to refer to these cousins as zoomers
00:12:47 But then I thought they might even be too too young to even be zoomers. But anyway, I just want to
00:12:53 Well, that's
00:12:55 Well, you know that the nomenclature in our fck right for the generations
00:12:59 I forget there's the I mean, there's the original people like the first generation
00:13:04 Oh, yes, and then there were the two the tumors were the people that joined in season two
00:13:11 And then there's the three tards
00:13:14 Season three and oh shit. I forget the one and
00:13:18 There are like sub ones that like the ones that joined during the negapause. There was between one and two
00:13:23 There was a name for those people to the dead dead born or something the born dead
00:13:28 Yes, the born dead. Yeah, the born deads because they joined when there was when everyone was a ghost and then the
00:13:33 Four necators from the season four. It's something like that. It's something like that
00:13:38 But but anyway, I just wanted to know had these kids
00:13:41 Were they familiar with like that kind of game?
00:13:44 Like have they ever played they ever played Jack and Daxter Banjo-Kazooie or whatever?
00:13:48 I know like oh, it's one of those kind of games or were they like what the fuck they had no commentary on like
00:13:53 Oh, it's just like this game. They just were playing it and like oh cool
00:13:58 Yeah, yeah, so I think
00:14:01 It certainly didn't confuse them they they saw it was a 3d game and you're a pumpkin you jump around
00:14:07 You got a little person
00:14:09 That's pretty cool. That's pretty cool. You can pick them up and throw them. That was fun
00:14:13 I mean people asked me like what I've been doing and I did you know, I
00:14:17 Would tell them
00:14:19 You know, I made a I made a big huge video on YouTube that did pretty well
00:14:25 Got a bunch of views and then sometimes I would say oh, yeah, I'm working on a book
00:14:29 I'm working on finishing a book of a graphic novel that I drew a couple years ago and everyone would be like, oh, that's cool
00:14:34 You know, everyone everyone can mostly comprehend those things
00:14:40 Did get into like a discussion about like the YouTube algorithm with one of my cousins
00:14:44 She she showed she showed me a tic-toc that she had made a few years ago that had gone viral
00:14:50 She's pretty funny. So, you know, that was cool
00:14:54 Yeah, didn't like didn't like show off slime and punishment or anything because that would be embarrassing
00:15:00 Yeah, I showed off
00:15:02 Clarissa gunsmoke. That was the two things. It's like, oh, what are you doing? Oh, I'm just sort of in between
00:15:07 Work and I'm working on like a little comic project. I'm doing Clarissa gunsmoke. I fill up my website
00:15:12 I show them things and I'm like, oh, this is really good. They say I'm like cool. Yeah. Yeah, they say
00:15:20 and then there's pumpkin alley and that's like
00:15:23 It's like, oh, yes
00:15:25 This is funny. No, I can I can I can see like you can show that to anyone
00:15:29 I mean, I feel like anyone can immediately appreciate like, oh, wow
00:15:32 You made a whole video game and it actually works and like this looks like
00:15:35 That's the way I would have made pumpkin alleys is so that when I go to family gatherings
00:15:40 I can show them something and I don't have to talk
00:15:42 Look at that. Look at the funny colors. That's not true. That's the only way you don't have to play the guitar
00:15:49 It was funny. My grandma was watching the kids play and she's like didn't understand couldn't understand what a game was
00:15:57 And she's like, oh, this is quite a long film. Isn't it like she thought I'd made a film
00:16:01 Oh, come on. They were playing she was I mean, she's a little
00:16:07 Okay
00:16:10 Is she like
00:16:12 Okay
00:16:14 All right in that case, I guess it's understandable, but like
00:16:18 Old people know what video what is she not? What is she not fucking remember Pong?
00:16:21 What is she not remember fucking Pac-Man and Donkey Kong like give me a break old lady?
00:16:26 Oh, she's like saying you're staying here. Stay in your fucking lane. It's like 80 something. Okay. Well, she was she's
00:16:32 Sure, but that means that she was like only she was only 40 when like Donkey Kong
00:16:38 What I'm so I'm not 40 year olds didn't know they did yes
00:16:41 They did 40 year olds would they would see Pac-Man on the news because it was a craze. They would see they would see
00:16:48 You know, it's not like she doesn't know what a video game is, but she just didn't in that moment
00:16:53 She was just sort of like lapsed in like understanding. It's like we made a game
00:16:57 She's like, oh, that's interesting and then later. She'd be like this is quite a long story like she doesn't realize very funny
00:17:04 Like it wasn't that's her. That's her little anyway of saying this is boring guys. This is boring
00:17:10 Yeah, well, she couldn't do anything about it. She was in the ha ha she's old now and she can't
00:17:16 The future is now
00:17:19 We sit and we play our film and I brought COVID for her for Christmas terrible shame on you shame on me
00:17:25 I didn't know I was perfectly I did catch I did not it wasn't COVID
00:17:31 But I definitely caught like a cold or something from my early Christmas Eve
00:17:36 Family gathering I was sniffling for a while after that, but it was fine. It wasn't that bad
00:17:41 Hmm
00:17:46 You know
00:17:47 The thing about being a dude at these sorts of gatherings is once you get your salutations out of the way and you've kind of said
00:17:54 Hello to everyone most of the time
00:17:57 You don't really have to talk because a football game will be on and you can just sit down and watch the football game
00:18:02 And that's perfectly acceptable and and then you don't have to like talk about stuff
00:18:07 You can just be like oh man that interception. Oh, he blew it. Oh, he blew it. Oh
00:18:13 Come on, man. Why don't you root? Why don't you why don't you why don't you bring one in for the home team?
00:18:19 You fucking said oh, this guy can't catch. Oh, this guy. Oh, he's got no range. He's got he's good close range
00:18:25 He's got no long-range game. Ah, what happened to Brady? Ah, geez, you know, it's just it's so easy
00:18:31 It could not could not be simpler
00:18:34 It's funny as not usually like a sports game on during one of those gatherings
00:18:41 Maybe the sometimes some sometimes during the summer, they'll probably be like I don't know if like some sort of thing
00:18:48 during a I don't know if maybe I
00:18:51 Feel like it might be an American tradition and the reason I say that is just because you know foot football season is in full
00:18:57 Is in full swing during the holiday season. There's always a game playing on
00:19:02 on Thanksgiving in
00:19:04 Christmas, maybe not on Christmas Day, but but on
00:19:08 Well, no, sometimes they're there probably is around them
00:19:11 You know, they probably do play on Christmas Eve Christmas Day New Year's like it's right the lead up to the the playoffs so like
00:19:19 Things are things are pitch. I mean the last
00:19:23 The last like
00:19:25 Football like soccer thing right that ended and that yeah that ended so I mean so, you know, it kind of would yeah
00:19:33 I guess yeah, so that would make kind of make sense that like that's a thing that we do just because the seasons are
00:19:39 lined up for it, but
00:19:42 Yeah, but anyway that makes it very like
00:19:46 Make makes it makes it effortless
00:19:49 That's my version of playing guitar, so I don't have to talk to anyone
00:19:52 Is just sit down and watch the game, but it's sort of yeah, there was a guitar there
00:19:57 I did play the guitar. I didn't know what to do. I'm just making fun of you. I was I was looking pretty good
00:20:03 I was looking pretty good. I had like some makeup on and I was like
00:20:07 Some people knew that I was trans and some people didn't and so but I didn't feel like correcting people and
00:20:14 it was just so it was it wasn't like I
00:20:18 Don't have any relatives that are against that. I don't think even my grandma's just sort of like okay like she's just
00:20:24 That's a very um, that's a very long
00:20:28 Gender you've got there. What's what's what's going on with that? Oh
00:20:37 Wait, that was a that was a call back to say that okay, I understand now lol
00:20:44 um
00:20:46 Yeah, yeah, I I looked good and I felt like because I looked good
00:20:51 It was easy to chat with people as opposed to when I look like a weirdo
00:20:56 And I'm like, oh these people are normal and they have like normal lives and stuff and
00:21:03 They're gonna hear about me talking about my art stuff. I'm doing and I'm like, I don't know
00:21:08 Yeah, I guess I don't know I gotta hey
00:21:11 Yeah, I don't know like that's that's all of it. It's always been like that
00:21:16 Like ah, but it was nice. It was like I had like a glass of wine. I was chatting with people
00:21:22 It was normal. I was so normal. It's amazing. That's a me. That's I'm happy for you
00:21:29 My my big takeaway from the holiday season has mostly been I
00:21:35 Mean I kind of already knew this but it sort of was hammered it into me even more
00:21:40 so all my relatives not all of them, but like most of them are quite bougie and
00:21:46 I
00:21:49 Truly am an insect just an insignificant worm
00:21:57 You know all my uncles and stuff most of them got like big houses and stuff not like mansions, but like
00:22:06 Some of some of them kind of have things you might you might describe as mansions
00:22:10 My cousin bunch of my cousins ones around my age got houses
00:22:15 They're they're like they're renting their houses to tenants and stuff, you know, bunch of a bunch of them are married
00:22:21 Bunch of we're having kids and whatever and I'm just like, ah jeez my I
00:22:26 Just I feel I feel a power differential forming there. I feel like I am lower on the societal
00:22:33 Totem pole. I feel like if it came to it if it came to some sort of conflict some sort of like battle between us
00:22:39 They would they would crush me they would defeat me because they have more institutional power in the form of
00:22:47 Capital and that
00:22:49 Upsets me that upsets me quite a lot. I
00:22:53 Want to crush my enemies. I want to crush my enemies and I want to know that if I need to crush someone I can crush them
00:22:59 Do you understand?
00:23:02 I do understand. Then we are then we are then we understand each other and then we are
00:23:10 Yeah, I mean trying to think of my family, there's a few of my cousins on my dad's side are like
00:23:17 Like one of them got into banking and he's like super wealthy and he's got his own house and it's all like
00:23:25 Was that a cousin you say a cousin? Yeah around around your age or a little older like five
00:23:32 Six years older. Yeah, okay, and he and he he studied really hard at school, and then he got back into like banking and stuff
00:23:39 And it's like that's some big money
00:23:42 Sure, and it's it feels weird talking to him because I'm like, what am I I'm like on the other side of the family
00:23:48 unemployed basically and
00:23:50 I
00:23:52 Draw a bit and I make some music sometimes and animate and yeah, yeah
00:23:57 Yeah, I don't know how I can hold a conversation with him even though
00:24:02 We were like quite close when we were little
00:24:06 He showed me he showed me Grand Theft Auto
00:24:09 He showed me Vice City when I was like six. Yeah
00:24:12 And I played that in his room and it was like, oh my god. I ran over someone. Ha ha
00:24:18 Interesting that was cool. Yeah, and it's like now he's he's not different. It's just like I feel a little
00:24:25 Inadequate, I don't know and and yeah, so I so I understand the feeling
00:24:30 Yeah, yeah, sounds like pretty similar
00:24:34 um
00:24:35 I mean, I guess um
00:24:37 I guess my options are you know one
00:24:40 Just cope just cope and sieve
00:24:43 Cope and sieve and that's and usually that's what I would go
00:24:46 But let's explore alternatives here
00:24:49 Uh, I mean you can cope and grin. I can I can
00:24:53 Forgo the sea I can see this is important. I can cope and grieve cope and grieve. That's pretty good
00:24:59 Um, but no, I can I can just cope with it and be like, well, you know
00:25:03 I'm a I'm an art guy. I'm an internet poster guy. It's okay
00:25:07 It's okay that I don't uh
00:25:10 But I haven't bought a house or whatever
00:25:12 Whatever, I'll just be the indie. I'll just be the indie cousin man. It's fine. Yeah, and that's that's whatever that's okay
00:25:19 um
00:25:22 I could sell I could sell out
00:25:24 Is it you kind of it kind of makes me well
00:25:27 Kind of makes me want uh, it kind of makes me think again about that thing that I might have mentioned before about maybe
00:25:32 Maybe I should look for like a job with a studio or something
00:25:35 Maybe I should look for some kind of some kind of like some kind of slightly more legitimate
00:25:41 employment
00:25:42 you know
00:25:44 uh
00:25:45 Get some dental insurance now and like, you know, I've said this before
00:25:49 uh, I wouldn't
00:25:51 Wouldn't want to do some bullshit like uh, every time I every time I talk to my dad
00:25:54 My dad's always like you should work for oracle bet like you should like I know lots of people that work for oracle
00:25:59 Like they're always hiring you should work for oracle like why the fuck would I work for oracle?
00:26:04 What are you talking about?
00:26:06 What's oracle? Uh, some like technology or maybe they like cyber security or
00:26:12 Uh, internet browser or something, you know, they do some fucking stupid internet
00:26:17 He's offering some nepotism
00:26:19 I guess I mean, I don't think he has any connections to oracle. I mean, I guess he
00:26:24 He might have some patience. I don't think he could get me like a foot in the door
00:26:29 um
00:26:30 But I mean, why would I why would I want to work but think of the fact stack spin?
00:26:34 What would I what would I do for oracle?
00:26:37 I mean, you'd you'd hack into the mainframe. You release the secrets you'd whistle blow
00:26:44 I don't think that's a good way to get paid
00:26:47 Uh, you get paid first then you do it one paycheck
00:26:54 Um, uh
00:26:56 All right, so I mean
00:26:58 But you but you know what I'm saying like I don't want to do that
00:27:01 But um, but I would I would kind of like to say oh, yeah, I I work for someone I have a job doing something
00:27:07 I just
00:27:09 man
00:27:11 I don't know
00:27:13 Is it really just for the benefit of like a social awkwardness moment in a family gathering not not really
00:27:19 It's not really about that. It's not about being embarrassed
00:27:24 It's because you know, I didn't really feel that embarrassed. I didn't feel like my cousins were judging me super hard or anything
00:27:28 I didn't feel like oh no. What do they think about me? It's not like that. It was about
00:27:33 You know, just the the things they were talking about
00:27:36 Uh, just made me
00:27:38 I mean, I'm sorry, but it leads me
00:27:41 Literally what I said about like they could crush me and I want and I want to be able to crush them first
00:27:50 Um
00:27:51 Yeah
00:27:52 You could crush them with a train become a train driver. I'm sorry, but I'm just I'm just
00:27:58 Out to a crew as much as much power as much power as possible and I feel like um
00:28:04 I have I have I have behave suboptimally in that realm. It's not about right. It's not about money
00:28:09 It's not about it's not about buying things
00:28:13 Except that it is because capital will protect me
00:28:17 And will be used and I can wield it as a weapon if I need to
00:28:21 So it is about money, but not in the sense that I just want to buy things with it
00:28:26 Uh, I feel like this this could slot into the meme
00:28:29 Of you hiding behind the table and something coming through the door
00:28:34 Like family members coming through the door who have money
00:28:39 What's what's coming through the door? Is it is it a is it a bunch of
00:28:44 Job offers being like come out and come out and accept your paycheck
00:28:50 I hate capital I hate capital or uh, something something like that something like that
00:28:56 um
00:28:58 Okay, I don't want to I didn't want to uh, uh, I don't want to drag this point out or anything, but uh, that's
00:29:06 That's for a man. Hey suggest. Hey suggest in the comments
00:29:09 Suggest to me in the comments
00:29:11 Uh, what what jobs should I apply to that I can uh, you know work as a creative professional
00:29:18 and also a crew capital and uh
00:29:22 You should become a professor become institutionally powerful a professor of weird internet shit at a real university
00:29:32 They'll probably have a course for that. I'll just do that. You know what?
00:29:36 I saw a tweet the other day and I don't know if it's true
00:29:38 I don't know what this person's bona fides was
00:29:40 But he just said like you used to be able to just send a letter to a university and be like
00:29:45 Hey, I just want to study so-and-so
00:29:48 Give me a job as a professor so I can do that and they and sometimes they'd just be like, okay
00:29:53 You know not all the time, but like if you had something legit
00:29:58 If you had a nice jacket you had a nice I do I do have a nice jacket. Well, it's kind of old
00:30:04 Maybe I should get a new one
00:30:06 But um that you know, I think like nowadays
00:30:11 I don't even know how you'd go about doing that. I don't even know how you'd go about doing that these days
00:30:16 Probably it's just the same. It's just everybody thinks it's not doable
00:30:21 Send a little letter so hand written letter
00:30:23 and you and like
00:30:26 And then uh better than hand written better than lipstick kiss like a lipstick kiss on the bottom xo xo
00:30:34 Better than hand written
00:30:36 Assemble the letter from cut out letters from different magazine articles
00:30:43 And then attach like a photo like a crime photo, you know the ones
00:30:48 Sure. Well, first I have to commit a crime to take to take a photo of it. Oh, oh, yeah
00:30:53 Yeah, yeah, I'm like scenes of the crime. I think yeah, here's me doing a crime just unrelated to the letter
00:31:00 Yeah, just to let him know
00:31:03 That I love crime and that I'm a democrat and that and I wouldn't do crime here if I was employed
00:31:12 I could I could do crime if I want to but I've chosen to work for you instead
00:31:21 So that's so that's my Christmas a yearning for
00:31:25 About
00:31:30 The only other thing I have to say about Christmas
00:31:33 Is that I got very drunk on
00:31:35 Christmas Eve
00:31:36 Cool, and I was hungover for the whole of Christmas day
00:31:40 That's pretty I was like I was about I was like passing out like I got us. I got to lie down
00:31:45 When we were all open in the presence, which kind of ruined the moment, but that's okay
00:31:50 I uh
00:31:52 because uh
00:31:53 I felt better and that's the end of that story
00:32:00 Spectacular I
00:32:02 I didn't really I didn't really have any hangover. I drank a little bit on like uh Christmas Eve
00:32:06 And a bit I don't know why I was hungover because I like hung over at all. I got like I just like
00:32:13 This was just a few glasses of red wine. It was like four to five now in my in my experience
00:32:18 I feel like wine gives you worse hangovers than other kinds of uh
00:32:23 I guess so I'm not sure why that is or if maybe it's just a coincidence or I was even imagining it
00:32:28 That's just that's just the feeling that I have for my experiences
00:32:32 Like maybe I should have been on the the spirits or something
00:32:37 Definitely definitely switch to the heart definitely switch to the heart. So yeah the eggless
00:32:42 Just pouring drinking straight rum out of a tumbler. Yeah, I call it eggless. No
00:32:48 That's good. That's good
00:32:50 um
00:32:52 But you didn't try you didn't have any egg nog
00:32:54 Nobody nobody had any egg. It's just not a thing
00:32:59 It's good though. It's so good
00:33:02 Look, it's like a nutmeg milkshake
00:33:05 Bre
00:33:08 I am
00:33:10 I am
00:33:12 I have lots of leftover meat. I have lots of leftover meat and cold cuts from the the new year's gathering
00:33:18 So that's cool. That's protein
00:33:21 Yes, I am protein
00:33:24 Uh, I am
00:33:26 Yeah, I guess so
00:33:27 um
00:33:28 My lifts my lifts
00:33:30 I'm gaining weight, but that's fine. My lifts are coming along
00:33:34 They're not amazing yet, but they're getting they're getting back to a somewhat respect. I mean not even respect. They're getting back to a
00:33:41 an okay starting point
00:33:44 um
00:33:45 One of my new year's resolutions is to keep lifting and a deadlift 300 again
00:33:49 Uh, that's how I that's how I'll know
00:33:52 That i'm really doing it
00:33:54 um
00:33:57 I guess
00:33:58 My new year's resolution is to lower my testosterone to the correct amount
00:34:02 Because of my moment to raise my testosterone. Give me some of your excess
00:34:08 Sure. I don't know how to do that
00:34:10 Siphon it out
00:34:12 Send me your blood. Send me your blood
00:34:15 I used to need to take all of my blood and then like filter out the testosterone and then put my the blood back in
00:34:21 And then you can have the tea all all I want for Christmas is gibbs blood
00:34:36 Yeah, I don't know what are you spit it out nothing
00:34:40 Nothing nothing. How's your new years? Is that any different from Christmas? Was it the same sort of thing?
00:34:46 I mean in the evening the new year's evening
00:34:48 I just hung out at the the munchie house and there's a couple people in town visiting for that. We watched. Oh, we watched um
00:34:55 What's that movie? Sorry to bother you. You know that one?
00:34:58 Nope
00:34:59 It's a boots boots Riley. I think oh shit
00:35:03 Is he the actor too or is he just the director?
00:35:06 I don't know
00:35:08 um
00:35:09 No, he's just the director. Um
00:35:12 Uh, it's about um
00:35:15 Well, I can't really I honestly I can't really explain what it's about without
00:35:18 Spoiling it, but it's that one where the black guy joins the like telecommunications
00:35:23 or the telemarketing
00:35:25 job
00:35:26 And the guy tells him to use your use your white voice
00:35:30 Use your white voice when you're calling white people to sell them shit
00:35:33 And uh, he's his white voice is voiced by david cross
00:35:37 It was pretty good pretty good kind of fucked up kind of kind of some weird wacky twists and turns
00:35:45 But it was a good watch
00:35:47 And that's held. Yeah, it's pretty much. It's pretty much all I did pretty much all I did
00:35:52 We got chicken and waffles went out for breakfast. I got chicken and waffles on new year's evening. That was great
00:35:58 Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum
00:36:03 Uh, I mean, you know, yeah nothing much
00:36:06 Nothing nothing nothing much going on
00:36:08 I did the uh, the new year's stream on on twitch, right?
00:36:14 I played a video game fleshed away on ps2
00:36:18 Wait, remember that fleshed away
00:36:21 The movie the um the art movie the game
00:36:24 Right. Okay. Is that a is that a 3d collectathon or is it a 3d platformer collectathon?
00:36:30 and it's it's
00:36:32 Like but it's bad, but it's kind of okay. Actually. It's fun and it's really funny looking
00:36:37 I watched that movie at christmas like two or three years ago
00:36:42 I think and I really like and I really liked it. Yeah, I thought it was great
00:36:46 I don't remember it. It's like I know
00:36:49 Is it hu grant ret?
00:36:52 Yeah, I think so. I think so and he's and he's doing his hu grant voice
00:36:56 Hugh granted his hu grantiest
00:36:59 and and
00:37:00 And so he goes into the sewers and he's a rat
00:37:04 And and he has to learn to be
00:37:07 Of like a shit rat instead of a clean rat. Hmm. That's the moral of the tale. That's that's it
00:37:14 Uh, yeah, I thought that movie was great and was just a good clean a good clean
00:37:22 Uh, you know compelling
00:37:24 You know three act heroes journey
00:37:27 not not in like a really like
00:37:29 The the like the structure is boring
00:37:31 I like they obviously stuck really close to the structure and and I and it takes me out of the movie
00:37:36 But I'm just like, yeah, you like solid just really solid solid storytelling
00:37:42 Yeah, and I just enjoy enjoyable the whole way through
00:37:46 Pays pace perfectly is quite good. I don't remember flushed away being bad. I just
00:37:52 I remember the the most
00:37:55 The thinking the most
00:37:56 interesting aspect of it was the fact that it is cgi the first cgi ardman animation
00:38:03 Um
00:38:05 Before that they were all like plasticine and stuff and clay
00:38:09 Um, and it's like they made it look like it was clay, but it wasn't
00:38:13 Yeah, so aside for it. So in terms of the story, I actually can't remember whether it was like terrible or fine
00:38:18 It's good and I guess I'm here to tell you it's good
00:38:21 Good my mom didn't like it. She thought it was gross. She doesn't like gross out
00:38:26 Stuff the slugs and slime. I guess so I guess so. Yeah
00:38:32 um
00:38:33 But it was fun stream. I kind of want to stream more often. Oh, that's another thing. Yeah, I want to uh,
00:38:40 I don't know if I hope I haven't said this before but
00:38:44 Okay, I have been in between holidays
00:38:47 I've been really trying to work on that book and I said I was gonna get the book done by the new years
00:38:50 And I didn't and it's kind of my fault, but it's also kind of the fault of my shitty internet
00:38:55 Which has been even worse than usual
00:38:57 It's been almost unusual unusable like a lot of the time and it's really fucking me up
00:39:02 So I'm gonna get that fixed and then once my internet is fixed
00:39:05 I am gonna start streaming and what I'm gonna stream is I'm gonna stream myself playing
00:39:10 Uh mega man battle network. I'm gonna play the whole yeah
00:39:13 Yes, I'm gonna play the whole battle network series and I'm gonna stream it because I should have streamed myself playing all the mega man games
00:39:20 And I feel like it was a bit of a missed opportunity that I didn't stream myself playing 45 different mega man games
00:39:25 Because that would have been content and I would have got donos
00:39:28 So yeah, so this time i'm gonna do it because I gotta play those games because I gotta make that video
00:39:33 But I might as well do it on stream and so I will and it's gonna be fun
00:39:38 And it's gonna be fun god damn it and you're gonna watch it. You're gonna watch it
00:39:43 Oh my god, I better watch it. You're gonna watch it
00:39:50 Is that the lowest you can go?
00:39:53 The lowest?
00:39:54 You're gonna watch it
00:39:58 I was trying to do the um, uh, mr. Plinkett
00:40:02 Yelling at nadine
00:40:04 You're gonna you're gonna watch the star wars movie. Oh, yeah
00:40:09 Speaking of
00:40:11 Mr. Plinkett speaking of the angry video game nerd. I've been rewatching a lot of angry video game nerd
00:40:17 Yeah, I've just been putting it that's just sort of been my like put it on in the background while I do other stuff
00:40:22 content lately
00:40:23 and I think
00:40:25 In the hot take I think
00:40:28 I think we as a society
00:40:30 need to
00:40:31 Need to start to be okay
00:40:33 with admitting
00:40:35 That it's bad even though
00:40:37 We think that uh, uh, uh, what's his name is a good guy, right?
00:40:43 Uh, the show is bad james, uh
00:40:46 Is his name james, uh, rolf james rolf. Yeah, I think I think we need to admit to a society that
00:40:52 Yeah, I guess it's charming or whatever. Yeah, I guess he's got enthusiasm or whatever
00:40:55 But like the content is bad the comedy is bad. He's not a good comedian
00:40:59 Uh, it's a bad show. We liked it because it was unique, but it was bad
00:41:04 And it's okay to admit that even though james rolf seems like a decent guy and a family man
00:41:08 And oh, we don't want to offend him. Oh, no
00:41:09 We don't want to compare him to dug walker because dug walker is an asshole and an incompetent stooge and a hack
00:41:14 And we don't like dug a dug sucks and that's true and we don't feel that way about james
00:41:18 But we should we we should we should be able to look ourselves in the mirror and say
00:41:23 The show was bad
00:41:25 uh
00:41:26 I I mean, I would agree that there's plenty of episodes that are just certainly
00:41:32 Like un un good. They're not good. They're bad. Yes. Um, I'm what
00:41:39 Did you watch like from the very beginning?
00:41:41 I've been what I've been sort of just skipping around watching watching the old
00:41:46 I mean, I've been watching the like the full season compilations
00:41:50 So like I'll watch season two and then I'll watch season 12 and then I'll watch season five and I'll watch season 11
00:41:56 There there I a few years ago. I was watching
00:42:00 All of them again, and I'm like I there's definitely a point beyond which
00:42:06 It's like there's a golden era where like mostly episodes are fun and good and then
00:42:11 Something changes and it sucks. I'm and it's sort of like this kind of the same but it just sort of feels weird
00:42:18 His delivery is a bit like annoying
00:42:22 And at like after a certain point
00:42:24 I'm gonna say even even though I kind of know what you mean
00:42:27 I there is sort of a difference in delivery
00:42:29 But I honestly don't think it's that
00:42:32 Much and I think that the early show and the late show are more similar
00:42:36 Than they are different. I don't I think it's I think it's kind of
00:42:40 Hasn't really changed that much
00:42:42 I'll I'll believe that I still will watch them because I'm nostalgic for those
00:42:48 Yeah, my feeling I think you know, I watched a bunch of
00:42:51 I think I watched a bunch of newer ones like I started on the latest season
00:42:55 And I watched through it and I was like lol, okay
00:42:58 And then I went back to an early season and I was like wasn't that
00:43:02 Wasn't that different
00:43:04 He's kind of always been
00:43:07 If I if I if I just gripe like
00:43:10 A lot of his delivery is is weird and his timing
00:43:15 Is really weird and a lot of his jokes are like not even jokes like when he'll just
00:43:19 And this is the thing he's always done. He's always done it where like
00:43:23 he'll be like
00:43:24 I don't know read
00:43:25 Read in the box of the game like oh this game
00:43:29 This game lets you uh, uh
00:43:31 You know, uh, uh, this game lets you bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Yeah
00:43:37 This game lets you bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki
00:43:40 Yeah, and like that's the joke the joke is he like repeats something and then he says yeah, and that's the joke
00:43:48 Yeah, I mean
00:43:49 I don't like those and it's not even he he does it all the time
00:43:53 He does it all the time. He does it all the time to the point. It's like that's his style of comedy
00:43:58 Here there's a and it's hack. It's really it is. There's a like an upsetting amount of like references
00:44:07 Like taken in their entirety and maybe changed slightly to fit the whatever you're saying
00:44:14 Um of like things he likes like movies and shows and stuff things. I didn't understand. I didn't see them as references
00:44:20 I thought he was being smart
00:44:22 But no, he was just quoting something and it's like so much of of what he did was just quoting something
00:44:28 A lot of people around that time. Yeah of like internet content creators. It's just like hey
00:44:33 I know this movie. I'm gonna say a line from it. If you know the movie
00:44:37 You're what you're you're great. You're a cool guy. Yeah, that's true
00:44:42 That's true, but it's it's not the main issue that I was noticing on the same on the same vein as what I just said like
00:44:50 You know a lot of the time
00:44:52 A joke will just be
00:44:54 That he just says what's happening in the game and he reacts with like inquiry. He's like, oh, man
00:45:00 They're like, oh, yeah, or like damn
00:45:04 and like that's
00:45:05 There's no joke
00:45:07 It's just in noting what he sees and then well saying damn or something like that
00:45:13 I mean and then sometimes he'll say
00:45:15 This is a poopy stick
00:45:17 On a on a dog's anus or something and it's like, okay. Okay. At least that at least that's something
00:45:23 At least you've made something out of it. I don't have like a problem with like just having the gameplay and then like
00:45:32 Like responding to something. Yeah, I think
00:45:35 The delivery changes over the course of what the decades or something and he sort of goes deeper and more growly and it sort of like is
00:45:44 Unnatural I like the earlier ones because it sounds like he's just a guy in his room playing a game and you're watching him
00:45:49 And he's like fuck
00:45:51 That's how you would say that if you were playing it. I only really feel that way about like season one
00:45:56 I think even by season two. He's become like fully
00:46:00 Stikopher. Yeah, maybe I haven't watched them in a few years
00:46:06 There's a mark difference between season one and season two
00:46:08 Oh, yeah, definitely season one doesn't even feel like a show. It's just like yeah
00:46:14 It's like a vague sense of a character. Mm-hmm
00:46:18 It also it's this is this is a neutral point. This is not a complaint
00:46:21 I just think it's very interesting that James Rolfe's idea of a stereotypical nerd is someone that drinks rolling rock
00:46:30 Like that's like that's a key element of the angry video game nerd characters that he likes to drink beer
00:46:35 And that's just such like a non-nerd drink in my opinion
00:46:39 I mean, I I remember him talking about like that
00:46:43 The reason for the beer specifically
00:46:46 Is that like he made the first one or he's just talking about cosylvania 2
00:46:51 It's like what if some guy was still angry at a video game all these years later?
00:46:55 Isn't that a funny concept me and then he did that and then he's like, all right
00:46:59 Now i'm gonna show him on screen
00:47:01 So he did dr. Jekyll mr. Hyde where he was dressed as a nerd stereotypical like glasses
00:47:07 All right, the first one didn't have video
00:47:10 The first one didn't have video the second one is like now i'm gonna like amp it up
00:47:14 This is like the sequel to that concept. Yeah, and he just was like so what if
00:47:19 This guy is so obsessed with this any ass game that has ruined his life to a ridiculous degree is such that he's drinking himself
00:47:27 Uh like silly
00:47:28 That you know, it's like such a strange idea that someone would be so obsessed
00:47:34 So he just picked up whatever he had in his fridge and it just happened to be rolling rock and then from then on he said
00:47:40 I guess that's a character trait. I'll bring it back and then that's his thing and that's the reason that's so silly
00:47:45 I mean, so it's almost like he he was he was trying to invent the trope of like
00:47:52 I mean, he kind of did invent the trope of like uh to this reviewing this game is so hard. It's so bad
00:47:57 I have to drink to get through it. Yeah. Yeah, I know like ironically he invented that
00:48:01 But he never really sells it because he never seems like he's getting drunk
00:48:05 He's never seems drunk or like he
00:48:08 Maybe i'm forgetting but like it's it's just a few episodes. It feels like it's something that he's doing casually
00:48:13 Yeah, it seems like just
00:48:15 It causes me to drink but then he continues talking normally. There's a few episodes where he gets so drunk
00:48:21 And then it's it's a bit
00:48:24 I don't even I don't remember that ever happened. Well, actually, you know, I think
00:48:28 The only one I can think of is like the the return to dr. Jekyll and mr. Hyde where he has like a big like
00:48:34 glass
00:48:35 Like what do you call them?
00:48:39 Mug
00:48:40 No, it's like a thing with a stuff a glass stopper in it and it's got alcohol some sort of a spirit
00:48:44 Oh like a
00:48:46 A canteen
00:48:48 Not a canteen a flat
00:48:51 It's like a huge thing. It's the sort of thing you would have like very expensive whiskey in
00:48:56 And he was drinking that and he was getting super drunk
00:48:58 Playing dr. Jekyll and mr. Hyde. Okay, so it sounds like in that episode. He actually did
00:49:03 Do the I have to get drunk to play this video. Yeah, okay, okay
00:49:08 um
00:49:09 But yeah, it's funny that it's just like
00:49:12 Ah this I hate this game sip
00:49:15 Like that's that's the extent of it most of the time. Yeah, it that's what I'm saying. Um
00:49:23 Yeah, I don't know, uh
00:49:25 I guess it's just you know
00:49:27 I don't have my favorite moments
00:49:29 But I don't I don't like go up and say oh, you've got to watch all of angry video game
00:49:34 It's just like I would never say that the feeling I have mostly found it pretty you know pretty enjoyable
00:49:40 Pretty an offensive to just have it on in the background
00:49:42 Just let it play lately like it's fine like I keep doing it
00:49:46 But I I have to say that in my opinion
00:49:51 A lot of the a lot of the a lot of the content that I feel is meant to be comedic
00:49:56 Is sort of not even really
00:49:59 Successfully executed joke. I think a lot of what I would describe as the comedy or the attempts at comedy is is hack
00:50:06 Uh and like a writer like a comedy writer could have made a joke out of this whereas the
00:50:12 Angry video game nerd will simply go. Yeah
00:50:15 Imagine that continues playing video game
00:50:20 That's it. Yeah, that's that's that's all I gotta say about uh James Rolf and you know, I want please
00:50:27 I'm sorry. Listen. I wish the man I wish the man nothing but the best. I know he's a family man. Okay, like I know
00:50:32 I know he's got a family Ben. I know I know and everyone's like, oh james. We just want him to we just want him to
00:50:39 He's he's uh, he just wants to be with his family now
00:50:42 He doesn't have time to make the angry video game nerd and like that's cool man. That's cool. That's good. You know
00:50:47 Good luck to him
00:50:49 um, my favorite moment
00:50:52 Of the top of my head from the angry video game nerd is the batman episode
00:50:57 where he's playing the batman games
00:50:59 and he's playing like
00:51:01 There's this one game where he has to use a grappling hook
00:51:05 To get to get somewhere and he's really really like getting really screamy angry like what the fuck?
00:51:13 Why is it not working?
00:51:15 There's something about the rant there that's like he's really blowing out the mic
00:51:19 and it's it's more
00:51:22 It's more than just sort of like a
00:51:24 I don't know like a throwaway moment
00:51:27 And I was like, yeah, that's great. And then also
00:51:29 Mike Matei playing the joker. That's probably my favorite joker
00:51:33 He's so better better than uh, not Ethan Hawke. Um
00:51:37 Heath Ledger, but not better than Heath Ledger. Yeah, but like he's he's like
00:51:42 I love him. I love him as the joker. It's so like it's annoying
00:51:46 But like for the in the in the show in the in the thing
00:51:49 He's just forcing him to play the shitty games and he's just going
00:51:54 And then he gets them all shoved up his ass at the end
00:51:57 there was a really
00:51:59 Funny moment and it was kind of unintentionally funny because I was watching the episodes out of order
00:52:05 And so I I got to one where you know, Bugs Bunny comes back
00:52:10 But it you know, I watched that
00:52:12 Before I watched the actual one where that like introduces Bugs Bunny
00:52:17 And so when Bugs Bunny Bugs Bunny just shows up and he goes
00:52:21 What's up doc and the nerd reacts to the mirror like appearance of Bugs Bunny with an immediate like
00:52:28 Furious like I'm gonna kill this mother fucker. Like I hate you. I hate you
00:52:34 Beating the shit out of and it's like what
00:52:37 I I knew that like, you know, I know that there's context there
00:52:40 But it didn't feel like it. It just feels like wow this guy just hates Bugs Bunny like for some reason
00:52:46 Uh, uh, uh, who knows why? Um, it's I mean, it's kind of like that in the in the original one as well
00:52:53 It's just like he's playing a Bugs Bunny game
00:52:56 And then it's like, yeah, it's Bugs Bunny Bugs fucking bunny and then he starts punching him
00:53:02 And I think the implication is that he doesn't like the shitty video game
00:53:06 Yeah, but like he goes straight to like beating the shit out of the bunny before he's even said anything
00:53:12 Is that right? Is that is that his first appearance? No, no, no. Well his first appearance is
00:53:18 Bugs Bunny's birthday blowout or something
00:53:20 Yeah, and I thought that like Bugs Bunny just comes in and they're just
00:53:24 Commentating on the game and and they get in a fight over how bad the game is or something
00:53:30 No, I think I think I remember it being like
00:53:33 He's playing the game and he's losing. It's like, ah, fuck this game and then
00:53:38 Bugs Bunny comes in. He's like, yeah, what's up, doc?
00:53:41 Maybe I'm thinking of that. Oh my god, it's Bugs Bunny. And then he just punches him
00:53:45 That's the joke is like he's not happy to see you. He's angry to see him. So, okay
00:53:50 Really? That was his first appearance. I just thought like
00:53:53 Okay, weird. Okay. No, I guess it was funny on purpose for the same reason that I found it funny. So, you know, good job
00:54:00 Yeah, I like the fucking the violence the Bugs Bunny stuff
00:54:06 Yeah, there's there's lots of nuggets of gold. It's just there's so like there's there's a point beyond which he's clearly like not interested in
00:54:14 Doing the show. Yeah, because of money reasons. He's like, well, I got to do one every month every two months
00:54:21 Uh, let's just do it and it's just sort of
00:54:24 I think I don't like it. I don't like it after a certain but I forget when I think but it's just sort of yeah
00:54:29 Yeah, generally like I watched the the kingdom hearts one where like he's playing kingdom hearts
00:54:35 Just because it was a big game at the time and like he he never even played the there's no nostalgia there
00:54:41 Uh, uh, and and it's
00:54:44 But he just kind of treats it the way he would play any other game
00:54:47 And I don't know I feel like the fact that I you see him like just kind of give the same
00:54:52 What were they thinking? What the fuck? I don't kind of it's like, oh man, you can just
00:54:56 This shit kind of just writes itself actually like you could literally just give the same treatment to any game and it wouldn't even matter
00:55:02 Uh, I kind of cheapen kind of cheapen the shtick
00:55:06 In hindsight a little bit
00:55:09 Uh, see seeing him do it also to these games that are not really worthy of it
00:55:15 You know
00:55:17 Yeah
00:55:18 You know, I just want
00:55:19 Capital so that I can destroy james so I can destroy james rolf that I can like ruin him ruin his personal and professional
00:55:28 Sort of get him it's only get him before he gets me
00:55:31 I want to you know, I want to step into into the anger video games nerd nerds room and he'll say oh
00:55:36 Ben sainte you made phantom revenge that game was a fucking dog zainus shitting out barf
00:55:41 And then he'll just jump and start kicking my ass and then I'll go like uh, I have a team of lawyers
00:55:46 I have a team of lawyers who are going to destroy you for this and he'll go
00:55:49 Oh, no, and then and then and then my and then the repo man will come and they'll just start carrying all his video games out
00:55:54 And I'll stand there and I'll be like ha ha ha. This is what you get
00:55:58 This is what you get because you didn't make enough money
00:56:00 You didn't make as much money as I did nerd and now you're going to the poor house
00:56:05 And he'll say no my family and I'll say I'm taking them too
00:56:09 And that's it. You have the money to buy them
00:56:12 And it's and it's just the plot of um and from there. It's just um
00:56:17 the um, uh
00:56:19 That song
00:56:21 It's that it's that music video. It's that song. Um
00:56:24 It's it's uh, it's thank you by dito. It's just um, it's just a music video for thank you by dito, but it's
00:56:31 But it's angry video game nerd. You know what I'm talking about. You know what I'm talking about
00:56:34 No, I you know you know you come on. Come on. Come on. You know
00:56:38 The song thank you by dito famously the song stamp sampled in m&m's song stan
00:56:46 uh is uh
00:56:48 Is a song that ironically juxtaposes
00:56:52 Uh, someone having a bad day. They describe a bad day that they had
00:56:56 Uh, but the chorus is saying thank you it's saying thank you to an imagined character
00:57:01 That is the their lover or loved one of some kind and they say it's the best day ever the best day ever because uh
00:57:06 Because you know, you gave me the best day ever because I was with you
00:57:09 Then the music video is dito is singing this while like her uh, the repo men are coming
00:57:15 They're just like kicking around her house. They're taking everything, right?
00:57:18 Uh, so it's that
00:57:21 Epic. Yeah, thank you. Thank you
00:57:26 Um, it's a good song though. You know who should do a music video about that
00:57:31 I mean, you know who should do a video about that as um, and I say this knowing that it's wrong
00:57:35 Um, Todd in the shadows should do a one hit wonderland about thank you
00:57:39 The only song that anyone knows by dito and only because it was sampled in stan
00:57:43 And I say that knowing full well that I'm sure he would be like um actually dito like charted on the top 40 like a dozen different times
00:57:52 Back in like the early 90s and I'd say I don't care
00:57:55 I don't care idiot. I don't know any of those songs. It's about my understanding
00:57:59 I mean, I mean, I mean, I'm not I'm not wrong
00:58:01 I feel like the average person if you ask them dito, they would be like who the fuck is dito
00:58:07 And then you'd say, you know, they did thank you and they'd be like what the fuck is thank you by dito
00:58:12 And they'd say and you'd say giving me the best day of my life and they'd say oh stan
00:58:17 Oh stan by m&m and they go. Yes stan. Yes dito is the one that made stan by m&m
00:58:23 You don't what what what I've never listened to m&m. What the what the fuck? I know the spaghetti song
00:58:32 I think that's what it's called actually
00:58:36 Wait, you mean um, you mean lose yourself lose yourself. That's the one
00:58:40 I know that because I was around when I was young and it was big and I was like, oh, okay
00:58:45 I mean stan was um stan was all over the radio
00:58:48 But I mean that's when I was uh
00:58:51 You know like an or a young teen or maybe in my maybe like 12 or 11 or 11 or something
00:58:55 I think uh stan is the one
00:58:58 It's really good stan is that it's like a sad song about um
00:59:03 It's from the point of view
00:59:05 Of a fan of a of a of a a fanatical fan of m&m writing him letters
00:59:12 Like saying like I want to meet you. I want to meet you my life is falling apart
00:59:17 But like my love for you m&m is like the thing that like gets me through the day and uh
00:59:25 Well, I won't spoil the ending no spoilers for the song
00:59:31 Okay, well, maybe I will spoil it then he fucking dies, okay
00:59:35 There you go
00:59:36 Bam the end of the song the final verse is m&m finally writing back and in the course of writing the letter
00:59:42 He realizes that a news story that he saw about someone driving their car off a bridget committing suicide
00:59:47 Was about the guy whose letters he never answered there you go and in the middle it goes uh place
00:59:53 Thank you by dito
00:59:55 And that's what everybody knows d dito from
00:59:59 Wow now you understand now I understand my multi-layered references now
01:00:04 I don't need to watch or listen to anything now. You don't need to listen to thank you by dito
01:00:09 You don't need to listen to my stand by m&m. You don't need to watch the angry video game nerd anymore
01:00:13 You don't need to listen to the pro crass nators podcast ever again
01:00:17 You got all the context and none of the content just the way it should be
01:00:22 yes
01:00:23 2023 is the year of nothing the year of no content. It's the year of no content, baby
01:00:33 I have I have big I have like simultaneously big plans and also
01:00:40 No plans for 2023. I want to
01:00:43 interesting I want to
01:00:45 No, I guess I guess I could say the same about myself in a certain way, but go on
01:00:49 I've I've got like Clarissa gunsmok on on the on my mind. I've got the the the the
01:00:56 the murmurings of bell japes sequel
01:00:59 the murmurings
01:01:01 There's things with like the whispers. There's there's stuff with uh pumpkin alley
01:01:06 um
01:01:07 and also
01:01:09 Stuff with red man and gun girl that is all sorts of comic and story ideas, but then also
01:01:16 I don't want to worry too much. I think a lot of last year. I was worrying
01:01:21 And the year before that as well just worrying worrying about
01:01:25 Am I gonna make it? Am I gonna be good? Is everybody gonna like me?
01:01:28 Am I gonna get money from this? Is is is any of this worth it?
01:01:31 Am I gonna do anything? Is everything gonna go be okay? Like I need to shut up
01:01:36 Just draw some some stuff and not like think too big
01:01:40 about the repercussions or the potential
01:01:43 failures or
01:01:45 Whether or not I do anything with my life from all of these stuffs
01:01:49 Hmm. I just need to just I just need to chill out
01:01:56 I need to chill out that's my my vibe. I guess I'm gonna go for that
01:02:01 My tea's gone cold. I'm wondering why
01:02:05 Got out of bed at all
01:02:07 Money and brains outside. It's a good song. It's a good song. What were you saying?
01:02:12 Um, I was saying I'm gonna kill you again saint. No, I hear I hear
01:02:16 Um, um worrying is bad. Yeah, so I sure hope I don't worry
01:02:25 Good one good one, um
01:02:28 My plans are big because I have as I you know, I
01:02:32 I don't know. I do have plans for things finish the book stream
01:02:38 Finish finish man finish the book stream battle network
01:02:42 Make some more lecture videos including a battle network one, but also it probably
01:02:48 I would think
01:02:49 I think it would be great if I could make at least three more lecture videos this year
01:02:53 I hope that's not like too ambitious
01:02:55 Feel like I should I feel like I should aim higher than that
01:02:59 uh
01:03:01 Even though I might aim high and fail that's the that's the way to do it
01:03:06 I mean if they were all you know, if they're all as long as the mega man video that would be impossible, but
01:03:12 They don't all have to be that long. So maybe it might be doable. Um, we'll see but um
01:03:20 So there's that and the streaming and there's the book and then
01:03:25 I don't know. I feel like that doesn't account for a whole year
01:03:28 And I keep feeling like I need to do something
01:03:33 I need to change what i'm doing. I need to change
01:03:36 Uh my life around I need to find something new to do with myself
01:03:41 In addition to not that I don't want to abandon any of these old things
01:03:44 But I feel like um, I need I need
01:03:48 Need to find need to find some new shit need to find some new shit to do
01:03:52 Some new shit to work towards and I don't know and I don't know what that
01:03:57 Would be or look like so
01:03:59 My plan my plan is find something to do
01:04:03 I mean you could always
01:04:05 Like a a simple-ish one is just to find like a some sort of a craft hobby to get into
01:04:11 I have a craft hobby. I make candy. You make candy. Yeah. Yeah, I have a craft
01:04:15 I have a crafty hobby like that
01:04:16 I mean I can get more into that get new molds try and make get fancy with it
01:04:20 Find new experiment with new recipes. That is something that I plan on doing
01:04:25 um
01:04:26 It's not exactly it's not exactly a goal
01:04:28 maybe um
01:04:30 Maybe try and get like uh, I don't know
01:04:34 Maybe try and get that shit like sold somewhere
01:04:36 Maybe maybe get like shit packaged and try and like try and make it a somewhat commercial venture
01:04:42 I don't know, you know, I think I did I mentioned that I think I might like kickstart those might do like at some
01:04:46 Point after the book is done. Just do a separate kickstarter, you know
01:04:50 Maybe just for like a couple thousand dollars or whatever and not a not a big production
01:04:53 But like let people buy like bags of candy
01:04:58 That I made. Yeah, I think kickstarter is the only way I know how to do anything
01:05:03 I mean the difficulty I guess is just
01:05:06 Selling food across
01:05:09 Like borders is very difficult. I I don't is it though?
01:05:15 Well, I'm just assuming I don't know like the laws or the regulations, but I'm sure
01:05:21 I actually think it is because it's not
01:05:23 Liquid and like shipping liquids can be kind of hard. Yeah, but like this this is this is this is, you know
01:05:28 Solid food and it's just you know, I mean shipping any package internationally is quite annoying and expensive
01:05:34 Unless you're amazon
01:05:36 I guess I'm thinking of like if it was like a branded product
01:05:39 And then getting the license to then sell that product in another country is a whole big thing
01:05:44 But simply sending a package to a human being directly is is simple
01:05:49 It's so so Kickstarter if you're doing it. Yeah, it's expensive and like labor intensive for you
01:05:56 Yeah, but yeah, I guess it would be the same as any other thing
01:06:00 for Kickstarter
01:06:02 That's that's something that
01:06:04 That's not like
01:06:05 Oh, that's what I want to do this year, but it is something that I keep thinking about like hey, wouldn't it be kind of funny if I did that?
01:06:11 Hey, wouldn't that be fun? Maybe
01:06:14 something that I want
01:06:15 thinking about trying
01:06:18 Could be could be a
01:06:21 See what happened though. I would want to get it like
01:06:23 If I did that I wouldn't just like send people shit and like ziploc bags. I would have like
01:06:29 I would have some level of like pseudo professional like oh, yeah
01:06:33 That would be an investment if you get like a little packaging machine that can like do the the ridged like press at the top
01:06:40 Whatever that is
01:06:42 Yeah, yeah, yeah
01:06:44 Little little plastic baggy. I would you know, I wonder
01:06:49 I bet something that could do something like that is not even that
01:06:52 I mean like a big industrial one would probably be really expensive, but like just one
01:06:56 Like maybe an indie one up up to like a hundred bucks for something like that. Maybe
01:07:02 That's
01:07:04 peanuts
01:07:05 nothing peanuts
01:07:06 You could even you could sell peanuts you could sell peanuts shaped gummies
01:07:11 I have worm I have worms now. Oh, I got new I got more worms because I already had worm molds
01:07:17 But I wanted to be able to make more at a time
01:07:20 So I asked my mom just get me some more of the same worm molds so I can make more worms so I can increase my product my rate of production
01:07:27 Uh, and she did and now I have
01:07:30 More worms
01:07:32 So watch it watch out
01:07:34 Waiting for the worms
01:07:37 That's my that's a pink floyd song. That's my reference. That's my musical reference. I know I know
01:07:43 I know that because I watched
01:07:48 A video about uh, I think I learned it from a dan dan olson's video
01:07:55 About about uh, the angry not the
01:07:58 Doug Walker. Yes. Yes. Yes. Sorry
01:08:02 Fuck that's the cursed cursed cursed directly like cursed
01:08:07 Lineage of knowledge. It is
01:08:10 It's fucked up that that's I only know things. I only know things
01:08:14 Not because I I only know things from
01:08:17 Angry video game narrative Doug Walker not because they talked about them because other people talked about them talking about them
01:08:23 And how they talked about them wrong
01:08:25 This is how I learned
01:08:26 So so much
01:08:28 So much I'm looking at the slime and punishment cover. I think I'm like mostly happy with how the cover turned out. I don't know
01:08:35 I don't know if I haven't seen that yet
01:08:37 Um, I uh, this is not a final
01:08:40 This is not a final design, but you know, I showed it before
01:08:44 And it was kind of it had like nightstar. I was gonna put like nightstar looking down
01:08:49 in the background
01:08:51 From the sky
01:08:52 I changed I think I'm taking her out. I think I think maybe I want to do something a little more like
01:08:57 this
01:08:58 Is it sending it is sending. Oh, yes, I do remember something with the the phantom core in there
01:09:05 Yeah, well, I I was just gonna draw buildings, but then I was like, what if I just
01:09:11 I think maybe it's a little more honest to put a bunch of like photo bash buildings like this in because like that's how it is
01:09:16 in the book like most of the backgrounds are
01:09:18 Edited photos and stuff. So this is like
01:09:22 Maybe more representative of the contents. I guess uh, in a way
01:09:26 Where's strawberry milk? He's been he's been fuck strawberry milk
01:09:30 He doesn't get a fucking slot on the cover. But if this is the moment this is the moment when you get pushed to the portal I
01:09:38 Don't give a fuck
01:09:41 This is strawberry erasure. Yeah
01:09:44 It is
01:09:46 What are you gonna do about it? So I'm gonna I'm gonna have too much capital
01:09:50 I'm gonna I'm gonna write a petition and then your capital will be all mine
01:09:56 Shit
01:09:58 if this
01:09:59 Making a petition
01:10:01 If it gets 10,000 signatures, I think ben sainte should give me all his money and I
01:10:07 Oh, no, I hope it doesn't get 10,000 signatures. Oh, no
01:10:10 That would I'd lose all my money
01:10:15 Ah
01:10:17 Elon musk making a poll. Hmm should ben sainte give give and take all his money
01:10:23 Oh, no, they voted yes. Oh, no, I gotta do it. Oh, no, then I gotta do it
01:10:28 Ben sainte says I will abide by the results of this poll
01:10:31 I will abide by I will abide by the results of any poll and any uh a petition
01:10:38 That is put in front of me. I will buy by any rules that they stipulate no matter what
01:10:42 That's the ben sainte guarantee
01:10:46 True
01:10:49 Trying to think anything else happens
01:10:53 Uh
01:10:54 The answer is no. No, I guess not
01:10:57 My internet's bad. My internet sucks and that makes me angry
01:11:03 Do you want to go all my roommates are like we gotta fix our internet
01:11:08 We gotta order some new internet and I say, yeah, we do gotta order some new internet
01:11:11 I agree. I'm glad we're all on the same page and then nobody orders any more internet
01:11:16 Nobody orders any new internet
01:11:18 And I'm certainly not gonna do it
01:11:23 Don't be ridiculous. Oh, okay. Where are you saying? Where are you?
01:11:28 Uh, I was just asking if you wanted to go to the one piece
01:11:32 We could yeah, you could talk about the new two two chapters
01:11:37 Two new chapters 10 70 and 10 71
01:11:41 So, oh, it's that one piece corner everybody block your ears
01:11:46 Unless you want to know years for the next two hours of the pod. Yeah, just just everybody nobody should listen to this part
01:11:54 Not even if you like one piece ab so loosely
01:11:58 Oh, no, um
01:12:01 That's really weird. I complained about my internet a second ago
01:12:04 Even though it was working fine and now it's uh now it's broken again
01:12:08 Now it doesn't work anymore. Well, it won't it won't load. It won't load 10 70
01:12:14 Even though
01:12:16 You know, usually most days
01:12:19 Oh, no, it went
01:12:20 Like I said, most days my internet at like 3 30 p.m. We'll we'll cut out for a while
01:12:27 All right, here we go 10 10 70. All right
01:12:31 um
01:12:32 All right, so uh the strongest humans there's this uh bunch of scientists on the cover. Let me try and uh identify these these people
01:12:41 Oh, I think there's no we don't know who they are aside from vega punk
01:12:47 No, these are definitely um, these are definitely um, I think that's gecko moria
01:12:52 Caesar clown and uh germa
01:12:56 Uh, which one's gecko moria? I think that's him on the left
01:13:01 Dang, you know
01:13:03 I mean, he looks he looks a lot different, but I think that's supposed to be him
01:13:08 Why does Caesar does Caesar clown have horns?
01:13:12 Yeah
01:13:13 Okay
01:13:15 Man, I just I just like like didn't think about this
01:13:20 But yeah, I don't I think right. That's that's germa, right? I mean, wait, is that his name or what's what's the germa dad's name?
01:13:26 the germa is his
01:13:28 Kingdom and then it's king judge
01:13:32 I think that's king judge
01:13:34 And then I have no idea who this woman in the hat is carmen san diego
01:13:39 looking at it's uh
01:13:41 Some sort of lady. That's that's correct
01:13:46 um
01:13:48 Oh, i'm getting a message
01:13:49 What?
01:13:51 The guy on the left is queen queen
01:13:55 Queen queen
01:13:57 You know queen is a scientist
01:14:00 This is before that's the big fat guy, right big fat guy and kaito's crew
01:14:06 Hmm
01:14:09 That would make more sense because moria is like
01:14:13 I don't know
01:14:15 What he has a different pass that I think we know some of yeah
01:14:20 Okay, I mean i'm prepared to be wrong about that. Um
01:14:24 So so okay, I mean i'm i'm looking i'm looking at queen and uh, okay
01:14:30 The only real resemblance I see is the eyes kind of
01:14:38 Sort of a mouth a little
01:14:42 Maybe it's the pants that you're supposed to think oh, he's got striped pants just like queen
01:14:48 Um
01:14:50 I think when it comes when it comes to like because I think we know that queen knows like scientist people
01:14:57 And he's like the the scientist guy
01:15:00 The scientist engineer of the kaito crew. He's the diseases guy, right?
01:15:05 Yeah, he made the disease thing that nearly got everybody and so this is mads which was
01:15:12 The thing from the last that there was a ship
01:15:15 That we saw on the previous chapters like cover page
01:15:19 With that one guy who I don't know who it is and then this these guys are in mads, I guess
01:15:24 I think I think so
01:15:26 I'm sorry. I'm I'm comparing him to queen and I just don't really see it
01:15:31 The the resemblance is uh is is passing at best
01:15:36 Uh like um
01:15:38 Oh, I didn't even read the thing culvert of urge
01:15:41 Promising scientists gathering for the sake of of the world and all mankind. But why do they have guns?
01:15:47 What's up, huh? Wait, wait, who sent you a message who sent you a message that said it was queen?
01:15:53 Uh secret secret message
01:15:57 Okay
01:15:58 Don't worry about it. Uh, I won't I won't then
01:16:03 Um
01:16:08 Yeah, it's like the scientists around them like surrounding them
01:16:12 Yeah, and they don't have guns and these guys have guns. Are they like attacking?
01:16:16 the
01:16:17 Looks like they're
01:16:20 Defending
01:16:22 I guess we'll know the next time
01:16:25 The promising scientists that have gathered for the benefit of the world and mankind
01:16:28 Uh
01:16:30 Well, I mean we can look at the next chapter in the next chapter. There's
01:16:36 Wait a minute. There's no, uh
01:16:40 There's no intro page in the next chapter. No, it's uh, it's like an early copy. What it's secret illegal early copy. Fuck
01:16:48 I see
01:16:50 I see
01:16:51 Um, all right. Anyway, uh, so last chapter
01:16:57 Uh luchi and luffy were fighting and uh sentomaro got sliced not dead not yet
01:17:06 And uh
01:17:09 Basically luffy's to be in fighting. He's he's being fine. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep
01:17:15 And we get to see the antics thing
01:17:17 We get to see the seraphim like doing some stuff
01:17:20 And then jimbey the jimbey seraphim uses
01:17:24 The swim fruit
01:17:26 Yeah, um, Frankie recognizes as being senor pink's fruit
01:17:29 Which was can you remind me what the swim fruit does?
01:17:33 Does it just let you swim through anything? Unless you swim through matter like you're a swimmer. Yeah, I guess. Yeah
01:17:39 Um, but he's doing like an awakened version of it, right?
01:17:43 I I'm not sure. I can't remember what senor pink was using it for it. Maybe the exact same like as depicted here
01:17:51 Um
01:17:54 He says
01:17:56 He recreated the same devil fruit
01:17:59 Uh, when it comes to art only only the zoan type can be manufactured
01:18:04 Okay, this
01:18:06 Uh, I think I might be reading a bad translation
01:18:09 Translators note the special fruits that vagabunk is referring to here are the mythical zoan types
01:18:15 Uh, he didn't mention mythical zoan per se although the df images shown here are the mythical zoan
01:18:20 devil fruit included kaito and
01:18:23 Wait, what what mythical devil fruit shown here? I don't oh he see oh he shows the fruits
01:18:28 Oh, I see just like sees his outrageous smile. Yeah, that person should just die already
01:18:34 Wait, this is this is a different fucking
01:18:38 This is a different translation
01:18:40 Then the one you read then the one that I read even though I read it on the same
01:18:44 It's like they changed it
01:18:45 All right, that's odd. I'm on tebc. Was it yeah tcb scans
01:18:51 tcb typical cracker behavior
01:18:55 Yeah
01:18:57 Uh, yeah, and when I read the original
01:19:00 Time it said uh, he vagabunk said like yes Caesar can make smile, but I consider that unacceptable
01:19:07 Yes, this one in this one. He's saying just like Caesar's outrageous smile
01:19:11 Hmm
01:19:14 They have a large amount of money in time the special fruits can also be reproduced whether you can awaken them is still
01:19:19 Unconfirmed. Okay, so he's all right
01:19:22 Yeah, he's saying you can you can reproduce zoan fruits even the mythical ones
01:19:28 probably
01:19:29 It's difficult where he tried logias. It was difficult trickier than expected, but it doesn't say he failed
01:19:35 Uh, which is uh ominous
01:19:38 And then there's an alternative of paramecia types
01:19:41 I found you can synthesize a blood additive from a paramecia user's lineage factor that will grant their power once transfused
01:19:49 That's what you see running through their arms. It's I call it green blood
01:19:54 He made blood so
01:19:57 you what
01:19:59 It's kind of it's kind of strange that frankie is so
01:20:02 Freaked out by the thought of making blood
01:20:05 Like this is like a big taboo or something
01:20:08 I think it's it's just sort of like the the playing god like you're making humans
01:20:13 Like there's there's so much more to this than just it's a robot
01:20:18 It's like it's got blood. It is
01:20:21 It can use devil fruits
01:20:24 Yeah, it's uh, it has a personality kind of even though it can be controlled. It's like
01:20:28 weird
01:20:29 And not like the same as building a robot. I'm um, I'm looking and like
01:20:35 We get this close-up of I think it's uh, like young bonnie's arm
01:20:40 With like the green have we
01:20:43 That's not bonnie. That's that's um
01:20:45 a boa handcock
01:20:48 The one with the close-up of the arm. Yeah, because you you see a couple panels later. She's doing the mellow mellow
01:20:53 No, you're right
01:20:55 But it's a close have we
01:20:56 Has this been a thing? Have we been able to see their green blood like
01:21:00 Before this I don't remember. I haven't looked closely enough
01:21:04 I know I kind of want to kind of want to go back and I just want to go back and look at them and just see like
01:21:09 I just want to see
01:21:11 Since when since when have they have big like gaps in their
01:21:15 body that showed like green blood
01:21:19 Uh load please
01:21:23 I'm so kind of cool
01:21:26 Yeah, see like freaking green goo in their little in their little arm tubes
01:21:30 Yes, please
01:21:35 Uh
01:21:37 Oh, no, they are there. Yeah chapter previous chapter. They've all got on their right arm a little band that
01:21:45 looked like an arm band, but it is in fact a glass
01:21:48 Like open area where you can see the blood flowing
01:21:52 Unlike the the upper arm or the the the I'll just
01:21:56 Screen yeah, just show me
01:21:59 Uh
01:22:04 It's kind of I mean, I guess they're all like
01:22:08 Wearing clothes except for
01:22:10 Hancock
01:22:12 I mean, she's wearing clothes, but she has her arm uncovered
01:22:17 There it is
01:22:19 Uh, let me see
01:22:22 Huh, yeah genuinely just missed it just
01:22:28 Yeah, I mean doesn't really look like anything so I guess you wouldn't think if if it was the anime if it was in color
01:22:34 I feel like my eye would have like shot right to it like what the fuck is that green shit
01:22:39 But uh, this is
01:22:41 I didn't even didn't even notice there was anything there
01:22:43 They've also mentioned that these are children so they're gonna grow stronger potentially and it's like
01:22:49 this idea that these
01:22:51 these uh these
01:22:54 This being this new race of artificial person
01:22:58 Is so powerful probably the most powerful beings in the history of the sea
01:23:03 Yeah
01:23:03 Like yeah, come on. Why'd you do that? Why would you do that? Why would you do that?
01:23:09 um
01:23:11 I mean
01:23:12 Because they can control them
01:23:14 It's gonna be like a big
01:23:17 Like problem
01:23:18 For somebody. Yeah, I think so. I mean imagine how Jinbe must feel about this
01:23:23 Yeah, Jinbe has got his little guy you cloned. Oh you cloned me
01:23:29 There's a little young clone of me running around with green blood and superpowers
01:23:35 Okay, and any any
01:23:37 Obeys you and will like and he's under orders to kill me at all, you know at any cost. Okay
01:23:43 Fine and and everybody and impaled down. They have access to that devil fruit. They can put them inside
01:23:49 The seraphim. Yeah, well, well the paramecies anyway
01:23:53 Yeah, at least those I assume the rest but
01:23:56 I haven't explicitly said that it's sound him saying that like logeas are difficult
01:24:01 It sounds to me like he has not been successful at logeas
01:24:05 So they can recreate zoan fruits and they can transfer paramecia abilities with
01:24:10 Green blood if they have access to their the did you say the lineage factor?
01:24:16 Yeah, I don't know what that means. I think if they have
01:24:19 Blood of the original user of that devil fruit. So they got like senor pink's blood
01:24:24 Yeah, they can turn that into green blood and give the devil fruit ability to appear a seraphim
01:24:30 That's what I think is is being said
01:24:32 so I wonder
01:24:34 Okay, so if a seraphim
01:24:38 So I think a seraphim will automatically have
01:24:42 The fruit ability of the person that they're a clone of right because like Hancock has the um
01:24:48 Well, we don't know that's the reason it could be that they have Hancock's blood as well
01:24:53 That's true. It could just be they they just gave her the same
01:24:56 fruit power
01:24:58 it's interesting though because
01:25:01 Uh, what happened to Hancock didn't wasn't there like a thing
01:25:05 that happened with her like
01:25:07 the
01:25:08 The war like garb was garb go go to amazonia or something. No, um, well, maybe but like, um
01:25:16 Hancock the the the warlords was dissolved and then her the amazon lily was like no longer a safe haven for her
01:25:25 Yeah, and and so they were you know marines came
01:25:29 But I forget what happened. I don't remember
01:25:32 Something happened. I don't I don't remember either
01:25:35 um
01:25:37 I mean, maybe we could maybe we could look it up. Uh
01:25:40 boa
01:25:41 Hancock
01:25:45 Oh my god, this article is so fucking long
01:25:48 There's so much every character. There's a billion things
01:25:52 Can you
01:25:53 Is is there not just like a a history section?
01:25:57 Okay. Well, this is actually
01:25:59 harder to uh
01:26:02 This is actually harder to find out like what's going on with her right now than I thought
01:26:08 uh
01:26:10 relationships
01:26:12 my worst enemies
01:26:15 I feel like
01:26:18 There should just be like a in this arc this happened, but there isn't
01:26:24 No, yeah, there's a body
01:26:26 There's a body measurements section
01:26:29 Yeah, I saw that Hora Oda responded to a fan saying her height is 191 centimeters
01:26:36 Wow, how how tall does that maker?
01:26:38 Uh six foot three and a half
01:26:41 wall
01:26:43 Da da da her three measurements are blah blah blah ha ha jake up breasts epic
01:26:49 That sounds about that sounds about right. Yes
01:26:52 Why is that oh history it's a whole tab that's different
01:26:56 Is that yes, it's kind of it's it's kind of funny that Oda will just be like
01:27:02 He draws he draws these stick figure big boob ladies and then when asked like how big are their tits?
01:27:07 He's like other they're j-cups. They're just so they're up there. They're like triple. They're like double h like
01:27:13 Oh, yeah, they're they're like, um, you know, they're like an eye cup
01:27:18 They're okay. You just pick a random letter from around that point. I mean he gives like specific
01:27:23 Like measurements he does and then it's it's great. He's a man after my own heart. Yeah. Yeah
01:27:31 okay, so
01:27:33 Why no country after the seven waller systems was abolished Hancock told the subjects not to worry
01:27:38 Uh about the incoming marine fleet the fleet and reminded them the reason the waller position has been offered in the first place
01:27:44 Was because of how strong they were
01:27:46 Then they had a battle the marine successfully breached the island when the black beard pirates also arrived
01:27:52 To take Hancock's ability. Yes, I vaguely remember that
01:27:55 Cody pleaded with her
01:27:58 to leave with the marines
01:28:00 She refused to surrender and petrified most of the marines
01:28:04 And the pirates she was about to attack Kobe when black bid grabbed her and nullified her ability
01:28:11 She warms. Yes, he was holding her
01:28:14 Hostage and and she and it was like a mexican standoff and it was like if you kill me
01:28:19 I won't like reverse the petrification on all these
01:28:22 People or something like that. Yeah condemned his crew mr. Permanent petrification
01:28:26 She did agree to restore the marines and pirates if they left the island
01:28:29 But teach refused to trust her
01:28:31 Before teach could kill her Rayleigh arrived and drove the black bid pirates and the marines out of Amazon lily
01:28:38 So
01:28:40 Yes, dang. Okay. I do I do remember so she's
01:28:43 She's okay like Rayleigh Rayleigh. I guess got got her. Okay
01:28:48 So weeks later believing the marines would come back to Amazon lily and caught question where she should go
01:28:53 Before concluding she wanted to marry Luffy
01:28:56 Well, of course, then she listened uh as
01:28:59 Shaku yaku. Who's that?
01:29:02 Isn't that the vega punk uh daft punk guy shaka?
01:29:06 Or is it shaku yaku?
01:29:07 Discuss vega wants to acknowledge
01:29:10 Wait
01:29:12 She was there
01:29:14 Who
01:29:15 Who is this it says it says like weeks later believe the marines would come back
01:29:19 Hancock questioned where she should go before conclusion. She wanted to marry Luffy second sentence yaku
01:29:24 She then listened to shaku yaku discuss vega punks technological developments
01:29:30 Oh shaku yaku is that lady who's with rally?
01:29:34 Oh shaki. Yeah, I think that wasn't her full name
01:29:39 Oh my god, is she gonna arrive is she gonna appear in this this arc everybody's going to egghead right now
01:29:45 Yeah, for real
01:29:48 All right, so that's what's going on with her
01:29:51 Uh, who could forget gloriosa
01:29:56 Me
01:29:57 Former empress of the kuja tribe from one generation before shaku yaku
01:30:02 Two generations before an unknown coup. Sorry. Who's kuja?
01:30:07 Three generations before but oh, oh, it's the it's the amazon lily tribe
01:30:11 Wait shaku yaku is from the amazon lily
01:30:16 What
01:30:17 Shaki is a former empress of amazon lily. What the fuck?
01:30:22 I don't remember that part. I just remember her being like it. She's just the lady in the bar
01:30:27 Yeah, that's what that's all I remember about her is that she hung out with rally
01:30:33 Okay, well, there's a
01:30:34 Yeah, there's an even there's like an old grandma who was an even formerer
01:30:39 Empress of the kuja tribe
01:30:42 Called gloriosa or elder neon
01:30:45 She's the old lady, right? She's a little little old lady with a snake staff. Yeah. Yeah
01:30:52 Okay, well, that's
01:30:55 This seems like
01:30:57 It's really fucking crazy. Uh that uh shaki is just an empress and just like oh, okay
01:31:04 I left I just left
01:31:06 Yeah, I um
01:31:11 Big thing to forget
01:31:14 So the fight continues, uh, we know we now know about greenblood
01:31:20 Greenblood's cool. I like that
01:31:23 Luffy with his like gear. What is it? What does he call this?
01:31:28 The white boy mode, but like what is it? What does he call it? Is it is it gear fifth?
01:31:34 I guess it's gear fifth
01:31:36 I don't remember. I don't remember if he says anything. He just sort of did it and he he has the big smile
01:31:41 And he's doing the goofy shit
01:31:44 And he's really like easily bodying
01:31:47 Uh
01:31:48 Luchy right now. Yeah, it is a wakened zone for him
01:31:52 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm
01:31:54 And so they they they're all going together
01:31:58 They go on a rocket ship. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What?
01:32:04 Uh, vagapunk. I mean what vagapunk says
01:32:08 Is that it's possible to replicate a mythical zone? I mean somebody else he could give someone he could replicate the hito hito
01:32:15 model joyboy
01:32:17 If he wanted like somebody else could could could be joyboy
01:32:21 Now that would be fucked that would be like then it would be like the marines are trying to get Luffy's blood so they can do that
01:32:28 And then yeah, yeah, no Luffy you're bleeding
01:32:31 Actually, that just occurred to me
01:32:33 But like they would definitely want to do that because the the the government knows that like the joyboy fruit is like the best fucking fruit
01:32:40 Hmm
01:32:42 terrifying
01:32:45 Think about it. It'll be a right at the end of one piece. It'll be like, oh, there's Luffy. Oh, no, it's evil Luffy
01:32:52 I obey maybe blackbeard will get it
01:32:54 It blackbeard will get it and he'll be but it'll be a different color. It'll be black
01:32:59 Just like how uh
01:33:01 The the kaito's fruit was duplicated for Momo, but it was pink and vagapunk was like, ah, fuck. It's worthless. It's wrong color
01:33:09 I'll make black joyboy
01:33:12 That's my that's my prediction
01:33:14 Calling it now calling it
01:33:17 It's a little over the top, but sure
01:33:19 I think it's plausible. I think blackbeard already has
01:33:23 A lot of power with his accumulation of multiple devil fruits within one body
01:33:29 What does he have he has the the the yami yami no me and he's got the darkness the gura gura no me
01:33:35 And whitebeards and who knows what else? Well, I mean I've well, yeah, who knows what else? I mean his crewmates have
01:33:43 I've heard people say that they expect him to get three fruits because of his like three-headed
01:33:48 um
01:33:49 You know flag
01:33:52 That could just be
01:33:54 I mean why stop it too?
01:33:57 Why stop it too?
01:33:58 Maybe after three you die
01:34:00 Maybe that I feel like that's already the case though
01:34:03 Like if you have a devil fruit you eat another one you will die. That's part of the lore for that
01:34:07 Yeah, that I don't know where we learn that but I definitely think that
01:34:12 I think we learn that in any slubby that if you eat a second fruit it just it kills you or you explode or something
01:34:17 Yeah, I think you die if you eat if you are a fruit user and you eat a second fruit
01:34:24 So so still still a mystery how this guy did it with do we even know we like have no idea how he got a second fruit power
01:34:31 We know that he did something they put it under the yeah covered whitebeard in a big cloth
01:34:36 Then he did a magic trick and then he's like ha ha
01:34:39 Good trick. Maybe he needed to suck his dick. Maybe that was the reason you covered it up
01:34:43 Definitely, I don't want people to see this. Come on. Definitely. I want everyone to know that I'm a super powerful
01:34:50 Fruit user, but I don't want them all to know that I'm gay and I suck dick. So
01:34:59 I don't I don't want them to know that I'm gonna suck whitebeard's
01:35:01 Legendarily massive dong from that one meme that everybody knows everybody seen even though it's like it's like he's dead
01:35:08 He's like standing dead
01:35:10 Yeah, well when that happened. So it's like a dead penis
01:35:14 So it'll be even worse
01:35:18 Blackbeard doesn't mind that's okay. That part's fine
01:35:25 So then everybody gets swooshed right up to the frontier dome
01:35:31 Luffy says uh to sentomaro. Yes, I'll protect vega punk
01:35:35 Sentomaro is like unconscious now and then the seraphim the seraphim are back under the control of cp nine cp zero
01:35:44 Uh, they're back in the control
01:35:48 Uh, we
01:35:50 They do wait. No
01:35:52 Well, cuz sentomaro is like unconscious or dying or dead
01:35:58 And you know, you can't control them from a distance
01:36:02 So now the sentomaro is out cold. Yeah, no, you're right. You're right. I forgot what's happening. Yeah, they have the the funny
01:36:09 controller things
01:36:10 Okay, and I mean I guess uh
01:36:14 What's what's the what's the
01:36:17 pika pika nomi fruit guy's name?
01:36:20 Uh kizaru kizaru kizaru says um
01:36:24 Send the warships to send the warships on the warships to egghead
01:36:29 We're gonna we're gonna kill them
01:36:32 Okay, so there's
01:36:33 I like how he says
01:36:35 Oh, the serahak crew has allied with vega punk on paper
01:36:38 That should make for a straightforward escape as we all expected
01:36:42 But boy, they are for a surprise
01:36:44 Because that this arc is not as short as it may have seemed at first it's gonna continue
01:36:49 You the you the reader might think that that makes uh that that's like well, obviously, you know, they don't
01:36:56 stand a chance, but
01:36:58 You will find the complications will arise. Okay. Yeah
01:37:03 And it's I did think that I thought like that
01:37:08 They gotta leave because yeah
01:37:10 No, no, but yeah, they're on their way. They're gonna fuck they're gonna fuck it up
01:37:13 So the marines and also vega punk is like, please can I come on your ship as the only way I can survive?
01:37:18 Yeah, makes it makes sense
01:37:21 so, okay
01:37:23 Well, actually, I'll I'll I'll save my thoughts generally until we go over the next chapter
01:37:29 chapter 10 70
01:37:31 Sorry, I got
01:37:34 Something in my throat
01:37:35 chapter 10 71 a hero is offensive
01:37:39 A hero is offensive a hero is offensive. Yeah. Well, I mean it's contracted with like a hero
01:37:45 Oh, I see
01:37:46 But it's it's sailing that you like a true hero is someone who's not afraid
01:37:50 To speak his mind to to you know to tell the true the true hero is one who's not afraid of cancel culture
01:37:55 Yes to tell the truth about about the show biz industry like Dave Chappelle
01:38:00 uh, uh, you know
01:38:02 It's like Dave Chappelle famously said
01:38:05 if it's
01:38:06 Italians it's the mob if it's Japanese it's the yakuza, but if it's the jews, it's a coincidence
01:38:13 That's what they want. That's what showbiz wants you to think but Dave should
01:38:17 Why am I even talking about this? Okay, no one
01:38:21 Nobody nobody cares nobody cares about fucking Dave Chappelle. You've you fucked it Dave
01:38:28 So
01:38:29 Someone who we knew was coming
01:38:32 Blast all right. He
01:38:33 crashes into the red line
01:38:35 crashes into the base of the red line
01:38:38 And then he's like
01:38:39 Everyone's like, oh my god, it's Bartholomew Kuma. You know that guy who we're all like we know about and he's a he's a slave
01:38:46 And what's what's going on?
01:38:48 and he's like
01:38:50 Like it looks like he's struggling
01:38:52 He's he's definitely breathing heavily and he hit his head very hard
01:38:56 But like what is going on with him? Is this place?
01:39:00 Are is he like right near marriage?
01:39:01 Well, like if they climbed up that wall would marriage wall be like right there
01:39:05 I think so. I think this is one of the places where like the people arrived to go to reverie
01:39:12 Yeah
01:39:13 So
01:39:14 Yeah, that's right. So he smashed into the wall and he looks up at the red line the world government thing
01:39:24 And I'm like, I thought he was going to egghead, but if he's going to marriage wire, what is he gonna do?
01:39:32 Is he go is he returning home due to orders?
01:39:39 Yeah
01:39:40 I guess I guess so or
01:39:43 I just I mean I just don't know
01:39:46 My first thought was like, oh, he's going to to see his daughter because of some sort of thing
01:39:54 Um, and I feel like he could have gone over the red line if he wanted to
01:39:58 But he hit the red line. Maybe he's like struggling against his robotic compulsions to go back
01:40:04 Because he wasn't fully like
01:40:07 Cyborg'd when he left
01:40:10 Yeah, oh right because he was with the uh, the with the in the Kamabaka kingdom
01:40:17 Everyone was trying to rebels with the rebellious revolutionaries. That's right
01:40:25 Like he's he's gotta appear there's it is Bonnie's here. Everybody's here. Um
01:40:32 I notice um, he's looking
01:40:35 Well, this is this is actually back on on um egghead, but like in the last chapter the big cloud around the uh
01:40:42 The dome the punk records had us had a 99 on it and this chapter. It's got a 100 on it
01:40:49 So it's like counting up to something
01:40:52 There's like a big like orbiting like like num numerical display
01:40:57 I don't know. I'm just
01:40:59 Wonder what the the number means I guess
01:41:03 I guess, I don't know
01:41:07 How many how many chapters of egghead are we in now not not that many only like like 10
01:41:13 10 12 maybe yeah 10
01:41:16 It's I mean it feels like not much, but yeah, it's a lot of a lot of drawings a lot of pages sure sure
01:41:24 Um
01:41:26 Kuma yeah, I have no idea what kuma is doing
01:41:28 We
01:41:31 It's it's so it's so all right. There's so many moving parts in this chapter
01:41:36 um
01:41:38 Vega punk and all the other punks all the other vega punks. They're all gonna go on the same ship with the straw hats
01:41:46 and uh
01:41:48 Oh, uh, then they're like
01:41:50 Uh, we need we might need help from that other person that mysterious other person
01:41:55 Uh on the island and then vega punks like yes, let's call him say please help
01:42:02 And we don't know who it is
01:42:05 So there's a there's a there's a mystery person who's gonna appear who is presumably strong. He's gonna help
01:42:12 Won't you be risking them too if we ask for help?
01:42:15 wait wait
01:42:17 Wait, uh, oh I got confused does vega punk and his sentences with quasar
01:42:21 Um in this uh translation apparently maybe they just in the other translations. I've already doesn't do that
01:42:28 I thought he was asking
01:42:30 Someone named quasar for help, but yeah, it's not the case. Okay. I see
01:42:37 Um, so it's just someone we when we have no idea who it is
01:42:42 So yeah, so bonnie is gunning after vega punk. She wants him to turn
01:42:48 Uh her dad kuma back into normal dad. Yeah, and he says he can't but there's a reason
01:42:55 There's a good reason or there's a reason
01:42:59 I'm assuming that it's because this is like part of kuma's plan like kuma wanted this for some reason
01:43:04 I I have to assume that because you know him being part of the revolutionary army
01:43:10 um
01:43:11 and they're being like
01:43:14 Him being part of a special race
01:43:16 There's a lot of mystery around his intentions
01:43:21 So yeah, his him having some sort of ulterior
01:43:24 Long game plan
01:43:26 It's so weird that like yeah, he's got all these plans and he's got all these like secrets even though he's like
01:43:31 He's almost like not he almost doesn't even exist anymore
01:43:34 He almost like is not even a person and yet he's still like enacting all these
01:43:38 It's kind of like in death note when uh when light like
01:43:42 Made itself on kira
01:43:44 And yeah, and then he kept he kept carrying out his own plans even though he didn't know them anymore
01:43:52 Yeah, it's like it could be maybe like oh
01:43:57 Let their guard down. They think
01:43:59 I'm under their control so I can do some something that
01:44:04 Would be impossible otherwise
01:44:06 Hmm
01:44:08 Yeah, and then I get the death note and I write the names of the the gurus say in the death note perfect genius
01:44:16 Masterful gambit sir
01:44:20 So the frontier dome goes offline
01:44:22 What is the frontier dome?
01:44:24 I believe it's the force field that stops people getting in maybe it's the thing that was counting up to 100
01:44:29 maybe um
01:44:31 But it goes offline
01:44:34 And just for just long enough uh for the three
01:44:39 Uh jumpy people from cp zero to jump up there kaku luchi and stussy
01:44:46 And then they're they're up there. They see the straw hat ship
01:44:49 And then we get an epic uh sword slice moment
01:44:53 It's the rematch. Yeah, luchi and luchi had a rematch and now kaku and zoro are gonna have one
01:45:00 Yeah, it's yeah
01:45:03 Ace just is so cool. Um, I love one piece
01:45:08 Uh
01:45:10 um, um
01:45:12 Yeah, okay, they're they're leaving
01:45:15 They're leaving with vega punk
01:45:19 Uh, bonnie is attacking him
01:45:22 Yeah, and then uh, we're at uh the
01:45:26 Fuck is it the kid pirates? Are they just called the kid pirates?
01:45:30 I yeah, I think so the kid pirates
01:45:32 Hey, um
01:45:34 It's is killer is killer. Uh, didn't he eat like a smile and it drove him crazy and now he laughs uncontrollably
01:45:43 I yeah, I didn't seem like he seems fine. He seems totally fine
01:45:49 Maybe maybe he forgot about it. Maybe they found a cure off screen. I I can't remember
01:45:54 If they did anything like that
01:45:57 Well, they're at elbaf and that's cool. Yes
01:46:00 They believe they're at elbaf. They probably are probably are that's just like a little aside
01:46:06 Um kid is at elbaf
01:46:08 And then we don't actually see anything about elbaf except that they have giant fish there
01:46:13 Oh, yeah, it is a big fish. Yeah
01:46:16 Isn't that fish bigger than normal? Hey, you know where things are bigger than normal elbaf
01:46:21 And also the entire grand line
01:46:24 Or
01:46:25 Yeah, but like even more
01:46:27 Even bigger things are even more things are even bigger on elba. Well, it's like america
01:46:32 You know everything's bigger in america, but in texas everything's even bigger
01:46:38 So elbaf is like wow the grand line. Yeah
01:46:41 That's what they say
01:46:43 Trust me. I'm an american
01:46:46 Meanwhile in g14 naval base
01:46:49 Which is apparently very close. Is that the place that they like broke out of?
01:46:54 Who?
01:46:56 Uh, no, I'm thinking of um
01:46:59 There was an anime only like filler arc where they had to
01:47:02 They landed in a in a jail and they had to break out of a marine base. Yeah, this is not bad. This is new world
01:47:08 This is I think the place where
01:47:11 um
01:47:12 smoker is based
01:47:15 Like the g14. I like uh skypea was not was before the new world
01:47:19 Yeah, that's great. No, no skypea. Yeah skypea was it was on the grand line, but it was not in the new world
01:47:26 Okay g14
01:47:28 That's where smoker have we seen this place before?
01:47:31 Uh, we have not we have seen this place before we haven't like explored it
01:47:35 It's just sort of like we know smoker and tashiki and a bunch of marines from g4
01:47:40 14 I think
01:47:42 Were the troop that met up or were at punk hazard and all that stuff and they're like
01:47:49 Battle hardened marines. They're big burly boys. Um in the new world. Um
01:47:56 And
01:47:57 Yeah, we got we got garp
01:48:00 garps here
01:48:01 Helmepo is crying
01:48:04 Helmepo and there's this black haired lady that he's talking to on the phone and there's this other girl
01:48:09 Who's this other girl this crying one?
01:48:12 Um, she I think there was a few chapters ago. I barely remembered it, but I went back
01:48:19 Um, this is vice admiral or vice. I can't remember something doll. I forget her rank
01:48:26 and this other character who is like, uh
01:48:30 Um the same rank as kobe friends with kobe. I guess we haven't seen her before I don't think doll is the black haired one
01:48:37 Yeah, and then this other girl, which I don't even know her name
01:48:40 Yeah, um, but they're like sort of looks familiar
01:48:43 Uh, it's kobe helmepo and her
01:48:46 buddy kobe's been kidnapped by black by black bear. So his garp is gonna go fight black beard
01:48:52 So, yeah, instead of going
01:48:54 Instead of going under kizaru's orders with warships to go to egghead, which is close by he's going to go instead
01:49:01 To get kobe back from black beard
01:49:04 um
01:49:05 Who had a confrontation as we spoke earlier
01:49:08 with bower hancock and rayley
01:49:12 and
01:49:13 kobe was there as well
01:49:15 and yes, and he yeah, he was yeah, he was the one that was like
01:49:20 Yeah, he yeah go with the marines. Uh, so that you don't die from black beard. Hmm. Yes. And she said no
01:49:30 So there's there's all this sort of stuff happening
01:49:33 And um, uh, it's a lot
01:49:36 But
01:49:38 There's a bunch of warships and kizaru on their way to egghead. I can comprehend this easily
01:49:43 There's kuma coming garp is nearby, but not going there black beard is
01:49:48 Going it's somewhere black beard is going
01:49:52 Okay, black beard
01:49:53 Failed to capture bower hancock. Yeah, and other than that. I don't think we know what he's doing
01:50:01 Um, well a few chapters before that I think or not before that
01:50:06 But a few chapters ago
01:50:08 He fought law didn't he?
01:50:11 He fought and he turned
01:50:12 Yeah, do you remember he fought the law and the law one thought I don't even know what happened
01:50:19 Uh, black beard and his crew
01:50:22 Came up to fight law to steal their
01:50:25 rubbings of the the poneglyphs
01:50:29 And the the doc q turned them all into women he did the gender
01:50:34 Oh, that's right
01:50:37 He did just very funny. He's I'm sorry. Was that a virus?
01:50:40 Did he does he have the does he have the freaking uh fruit that does that?
01:50:45 He has a fruit that does some sort of virus thing. Yes
01:50:50 And he just made a new virus and the virus was a turn you into switch your gender virus switch your gender virus
01:50:57 And everyone was like it's supposed to fluster them. Ha ha
01:51:01 Yeah, so it's like so it's like uh, it's like uh Naruto's sexy nojutsu
01:51:05 But instead of flustering the opponent by turning into a sexy lady and making them aroused
01:51:11 You fluster them by turning them into lady and making them confused
01:51:18 True interesting. Okay. Yeah, I do remember that now that you mentioned, you know, and
01:51:23 I know it would really have sucked
01:51:26 Uh, if if black beard got
01:51:29 Boa Hancock's fruit like he planned because then he would have the love fruit
01:51:34 And people would fall in love with him in a in a really weird like
01:51:39 I feel like him doing the pose
01:51:41 Yeah, and everyone going like heart eyes would be very strange
01:51:45 It's yeah, it's weird that he wanted that fruit. It's just
01:51:49 It's not I guess it's super powerful
01:51:52 I mean
01:51:54 It it it it's
01:51:57 Okay, hang on. Does it just make people fall in love with you or does it turn them to stone or does it do both?
01:52:03 It turns them to stone literally. Um, and I think it's praise on your
01:52:09 your uh
01:52:11 affection
01:52:12 Like it doesn't work on Luffy because Luffy is like asexual. He just doesn't know what sex is so it wouldn't work on anyone
01:52:18 Because everybody hates black beard and ugly so it just wouldn't do anything
01:52:23 That's the odd thing. Yeah, maybe I don't know idea. Hmm. Maybe you just wanted to hope that people would love him
01:52:32 I do you think maybe it was just hubris like he just thought like oh a fruit that's really powerful the more people love you
01:52:38 Oh, well, everyone loves me. Do you think it's just like he just thinks he's fucking awesome
01:52:43 And so he thought the fruit would be really good for him. Hmm
01:52:46 Interesting interesting
01:52:49 So, yeah, so this garp
01:52:52 It's I think it's just a lot. Are there any girls on the black beards team? Does he have a girl?
01:52:58 There's there's that one lady the this is like an old lady, right?
01:53:02 An older lady from impel down, right pirate. I think like
01:53:08 Yeah, I remember an L
01:53:11 I don't remember like what she does or anything. She's like a big nose, right? Yeah. Yeah, okay
01:53:17 like they're pirates
01:53:19 crew members
01:53:22 fucking
01:53:23 Katarina Devon that's her
01:53:26 Oh, of course who could forget Katarina Devon
01:53:31 She has not done anything yet
01:53:34 that I remember
01:53:36 Extremely tall pale skinned well endowed woman law
01:53:40 Of course, okay. You got it. We've got it. Yeah, but how well endowed is she?
01:53:44 Uh, well well, well, well, what do we got here? Who's a sexier old lady? Is it uh,
01:53:51 Katarina Devon or is it um, uh
01:53:54 Chopper's old mentor whose name is escaping me at the moment
01:53:58 Um old lady with the from drum island
01:54:02 Drum island. Yes. She's hotter
01:54:04 Just because she's got she's got that that swag. That's that's cool. She's got the the black leather
01:54:10 Well, she's the boots. Well, she's the glasses
01:54:14 Yeah, what's her? What's her name?
01:54:20 I can't it's not it's not kooja. That's the first thing kureha kureha kureha
01:54:26 Yeah, I would say kureha is harder if it's just my it's just my opinion because kureha has a slender build
01:54:32 Whereas this Katarina has kind of like a barrel-chested like muscular build and you know, it's just my personal preference
01:54:37 It's my personal preference that uh, uh, uh kureha
01:54:41 sexy
01:54:42 Yeah, kureha gilf everybody. I would say so. I would say so
01:54:48 It's I think i'm just yeah, uh, the fact that they just have a page of the kid pirates
01:54:56 Arriving at elba and then another page or double page of garp going on an expedition during all of this egghead stuff. It feels like
01:55:05 they're
01:55:07 it's sort of um
01:55:10 Like
01:55:11 It feels like they're building to
01:55:14 Ahead and they're having all of these things happen
01:55:17 Simultaneously, so they'll like culminate but like what the hell could culminate. Why are we learning about all of this stuff?
01:55:24 in this chapter
01:55:27 Is is something gonna happen in a few chapters where they all converge, you know really like oh my god
01:55:31 So they're all they're all going to different places
01:55:34 That's the thing. That's why it's like a little confusing. It's not confusing. I can comprehend it. It's just sort of like wow
01:55:40 Yeah, what the hell's gonna happen? It's a big mystery. What does
01:55:43 what does kid being on elba and
01:55:48 kizaru being on egghead
01:55:51 and uh
01:55:52 A garp and kuma being at the red line
01:55:56 kuma being at red line and maybe and marriage wa
01:56:00 and uh
01:56:02 Garp being wherever blackbeard is
01:56:06 I mean, maybe blackbeard is going to one of these places as well. So like maybe
01:56:10 I mean, maybe blackbeard and garp and kid will all end up at elba
01:56:16 uh
01:56:17 Just because
01:56:19 So blackbeard could show up at any one of these places at any time
01:56:24 And there's there's always the possibility that
01:56:28 kaito and big mom aren't dead
01:56:30 Because big mom had a whole thing with elba. I always expected her to like appear. Oh, that's true
01:56:37 At the giants because she's got such a connection to the giants
01:56:41 um
01:56:42 She's not from elba. Is she
01:56:45 I don't think she is maybe she's I forget like if she has like some giant dna
01:56:50 I don't think so. I think her parents are normal sized and she's just a freak. Yeah
01:56:55 And she learned about the giants and there was a giant at her town
01:57:00 They came and they were like friends
01:57:02 But then she had one of her like weirdo moments when she didn't get enough food and she fucking ruined everything
01:57:08 Yeah, yeah, and then the giants were like, um, this kid's too much get the fuck rid of her
01:57:14 I think that was the gist. Oh, was it the lady? Was it the lady who worked at the orphanage? Was she a giant?
01:57:19 No, no, she was small normal size. Hmm
01:57:23 Who was the giant in any event that I think they came to the
01:57:27 Where her village?
01:57:29 Or maybe she stayed with a giant the giants in a giant village because that was like a good place for her. Yeah
01:57:35 Uh, they I vaguely remember that I got to reread that part. But yeah, um, she's got
01:57:42 Uh an obsession with having a giant in her crew in her family
01:57:47 And she's been like banished from from Elba because she wants one of every race to be in her family. Yeah. Yes
01:57:57 Yes, understood
01:57:59 So I feel like I feel like big mom is definitely not dead just because that needs some sort of resolution
01:58:06 100 100%
01:58:08 100%
01:58:10 And then I think I guess it could be like kaito and big mom
01:58:14 They skulk away with their the remains of their crew and then they actually do form the new rocks pirates and they come back together
01:58:23 And they could they could clash on Elba
01:58:26 Yeah, there's so many fucking that would make sense for them to show up there. I think oh my god
01:58:33 Damn
01:58:34 And there's cobing. There's fucking x drake
01:58:36 There's all these marines going around doing marine things drake
01:58:40 Had like a falling out. They was working with basil hawkins, but then they like split up, right?
01:58:47 No, hawkins was working with kaito. He was like full full kuk mode
01:58:52 I'm just gonna be subservient to kaito. Nice. And deus drake was a undercover marine the whole time
01:58:58 Literally me literally me when I think about accruing power and accruing capital
01:59:02 It's time to go kuk mode. It's time to go kuk mode and be conservative because it will it would be a subservient
01:59:08 Because it will uh because it will it will generate capital for me
01:59:12 Who generate capital it will advance my position unless the straw hat pirates come and destroy everything
01:59:18 Right that would be bad
01:59:20 He'll be really bad to spend time working for kaito only for the straw hats to come and kill my boss
01:59:33 I like it. I like one piece. What can I say? I would say uh
01:59:37 Yeah, I've been telling anytime one piece comes up in conversation lately. I say I feel like it's as good as it's ever been
01:59:45 Yeah egg head egghead arc is really cool
01:59:48 And uh the story feels like it's got a lot of momentum right now
01:59:52 It's pretty exciting
01:59:57 How does he do it how does he do it how does he do it um
02:00:03 Nobody
02:00:05 Nobody knows
02:00:08 You I would be curious. He's a deal. He's got he's got the he's got the manga manga fruit
02:00:14 Oh my god
02:00:15 True. Mm-hmm. It is
02:00:17 it is
02:00:20 Like um, I would be really curious to see a manben episode
02:00:26 Of his holy shit. Can you imagine?
02:00:29 I mean, I yeah, it's it's just like clearly he's
02:00:33 Like a lot he's got a lot of stuff he does but he's definitely got assistance
02:00:40 He's definitely got a studio because there's no way
02:00:44 His arm would fall off his his entire arms would fall off
02:00:48 I think there's definitely like assistance. This is just speculation, but like for for backgrounds and stuff
02:00:54 Yeah, of course
02:00:56 Like and some of this it's just it's great
02:00:59 But how does it how does how does he do it?
02:01:03 Um
02:01:05 Every week basically
02:01:07 Dude a man a manben about
02:01:10 With oda would be a maid. There there was um
02:01:12 Okay, where there's some new manben's that came out or did some new episodes get translated like not that long ago
02:01:17 I think I think they got translated. I haven't seen them because yeah, because a new episode
02:01:23 You know
02:01:24 It's kind of useless to me unless it's been translated
02:01:27 So I kind of don't really care about new episodes coming out
02:01:29 I care about more episodes getting translated someone read not that long ago told me there were new episodes
02:01:35 And I haven't seen any of them
02:01:37 Join us next time on the pro crass there's podcast one piece corner
02:01:47 I feel like
02:01:49 At some point during that
02:01:52 I've had an idea popped into my head of something else
02:01:55 Some relevant shit that had happened or I was thinking about that I wanted to bring up and I thought
02:02:02 Not until after the we're in the one piece segment now
02:02:05 Oh
02:02:07 I remember
02:02:08 Uh, I was just wanted to mention that did a little slime rinalia holiday thing for uh for r with rfc k
02:02:16 If you could believe it
02:02:18 Uh, yeah, I actually actually drew some stuff for it if you can even imagine
02:02:23 Ben saint drawing
02:02:25 It's true. I know it's true. I did a little um
02:02:29 It was um one of the mods slash devs. Uh demodunk suggested to me that I
02:02:36 Do a little uh grinch
02:02:38 steel slime rinalia
02:02:41 villain
02:02:42 thing
02:02:44 So I did
02:02:45 But um, let me to briefly explain it. There was there was recently
02:02:51 a
02:02:53 A hack on the droplet which is some I don't really understand
02:02:58 I think that just means the bot. I think like the drop the droplet is like the code for the bot
02:03:03 It got hacked. There was like a leak. They had to do repair a bunch of stuff. It was kind of a hassle. Um
02:03:09 So I thought uh, hey, what if what if there was an item called the droplet
02:03:15 And it was like an endless rock. I actually think it was demo's idea that would be an endless rock
02:03:18 So we use the power of the droplet to cancel slime rinalia
02:03:22 um, the way that the way that I did it
02:03:25 was um
02:03:27 Well, there was a um the
02:03:30 Demo, I think was suggested a grinch thing, but I went a different way with it. I went um, you know, you know the movie the santa claws
02:03:39 Uh tim allen
02:03:41 That's the one where santa falls off the roof and tim allen puts on the suit and he becomes the new santa claws
02:03:47 I've seen a like an ad for that in a vhs, but I know what's the film
02:03:52 Yeah, I watched it as a kid, uh, but um
02:03:56 Yeah, so in the lore, uh, okay
02:03:59 first of all
02:04:00 The the the the lore the lore about slime rinalia is pretty you know, there's there's a febus aka slime and victus who is basically
02:04:09 mlachacom santa claws
02:04:11 But instead of giving you gifts he comes into your house and he steals all your shit
02:04:16 but
02:04:17 If you read between the lines even a little bit, it's pretty clear that's that slime and victus is actually just munchy
02:04:23 Sitting on my shoulders with a robe over us going around to juby's houses and robbing them
02:04:29 um, so
02:04:33 So in this in this in this new lore
02:04:36 Oh, uh, turns out there actually was a real febus
02:04:40 Oh, like oh, shit. He was real after all he does exist
02:04:43 And I and I caught him climbing up my roof and I yelled at him and he fell to his death
02:04:47 And I and I and I and I put on his robe and I cut him open and I found the the the endless rock in his kidneys
02:04:54 And now I'm the new and now I'm the new febus
02:04:57 Even though I already kind of was
02:05:00 And I cancel slime rinalia forever
02:05:04 Wow, and I drew some
02:05:05 Images of me announcing this
02:05:08 Becoming uh, let's see him. All right. I'll all right. I'll post him. All right. I'll freaking post him if you want
02:05:15 Yo
02:05:16 You're you're shrouded. I am shrouded. This is me
02:05:20 As I this is my the beginning of my announcement
02:05:23 I started at shroud and I started telling the story of the christmas miracle
02:05:27 Uh, and then I found uh, I found his business card
02:05:32 Found his business card as I was scavenging him
02:05:34 And then I reveal
02:05:37 The droplet
02:05:40 Wow becomes st. Invictus is what I'm calling myself now
02:05:44 Is that the the the endless rock? That is it. Yes. That is uh, that is the droplet
02:05:52 Layers within layers
02:05:54 See it's a kid see I found it in his kidneys. It's like a kidney stone
02:05:57 Because that's like a thing and anytime that I reference a kidney stone. It's funny because it reminds you the listener of the horrifying
02:06:06 Traumatic medical condition that I had that one time
02:06:09 Yeah, and that's funny. I'm so nostalgic for that. Me too. We have to go back
02:06:16 Uh, oh, why did I just switch to a new server? Uh
02:06:22 That's weird. Okay
02:06:23 Anyway, yeah, I drew these
02:06:26 drew these the other day
02:06:28 Then I made a big post in the auditorium, you know ruin the holiday for everyone, you know just for fun
02:06:33 Just for fun. It was my first it was like the first time I'd like uh, really like done any like
02:06:39 Are like rfck any like rfck interactions in a while. It was pretty fun
02:06:44 It was pretty neat
02:06:46 Had had fun with it. That's it. That's that's my and that was my other my other holiday
02:06:51 Story, how was my holiday? Well, this was part of it. It was part of the celebration
02:06:57 Thanks for asking
02:07:00 Okay
02:07:01 All right, let's shall we go to questions. I suppose we'll go to questions. I mean to voicemails. Well
02:07:08 Yeah, uh, they are often
02:07:10 Questions, but also not. I feel like I have a feeling we'll probably
02:07:15 I have a feeling at least one rfck
02:07:18 oid will probably uh
02:07:21 Mention that in the voicemails
02:07:23 um
02:07:27 So where are we? Uh, oh god
02:07:32 This one there's one just I'm looking for the latest one that we listened to
02:07:37 I think it's might be this one called yo slammer nailia
02:07:40 Yeah, so it'd be after that
02:07:42 There's a youtube link, but there's no description. So we skip those
02:07:46 Yeah
02:07:48 Is
02:07:52 Yeah, okay, I think the first one is called automation good
02:07:57 All right
02:07:59 Yeah, okay, let's do it
02:08:01 From blah blah at hotmail.blah automation good three two one go
02:08:08 So ben on episode 340 of the pro crest nature's podcast
02:08:13 You said something along the lines of I think that work bad and automation good
02:08:21 And while I can recognize some level of uh hyperbole in that statement. No, it did make me think because
02:08:29 Um, isn't that to some degree kind of a uh anti marxist settlement?
02:08:35 You know since from a marxist perspective, I'm pretty sure
02:08:39 capitalist criticism is not only because
02:08:42 uh capitalism exploits workers, but also because it demeans work in the sense of
02:08:48 Making it valuable only in the sense of its end product as opposed to
02:08:53 valuing the process of creation in and of itself
02:08:57 Uh, you know, I feel like
02:09:00 Automation valuing automation over work at all times. It kind of goes against that sentiment
02:09:06 Um, of course, you know, that doesn't mean you can never use automation, but
02:09:11 Like with a ir you know backgrounds fine, but you know don't overdo it
02:09:18 Yeah, no, I I get I get what he means though. I kind of I kind of don't get what he means
02:09:24 That's kind of the argument I had for like
02:09:27 Not against AI art, but just appreciating that there is
02:09:31 Value to be had in the creation of art for your own sake or like just it's fun to do
02:09:38 And so you don't have to automate stuff. You it's fun to draw. So like draw sure like you you were saying
02:09:45 It's good that you can automate stuff if you don't want to draw
02:09:49 Yeah, so I don't think they're
02:09:51 Like incompatible
02:09:53 Now I'm I'm no I'm no Marx scholar, right? I know I mean in in
02:10:00 In conquest of bread kropotnik is pretty I feel like kropotnik would say
02:10:05 Like yeah automate away as much work as possible. We should we should we should uh
02:10:11 We should automate anything we can because work is bad
02:10:14 We should like organize society to reduce the amount of work that needs to be done
02:10:19 um
02:10:21 this
02:10:23 I I feel like no, I I really feel like Marx would agree with that. I really feel like Marx would say that
02:10:33 The the need
02:10:35 I feel I feel like what did he what did I think this is prince
02:10:38 Uh, I think he said that like
02:10:41 Is it demeaning labor? Is it demeaning labor?
02:10:44 to
02:10:46 Reduce the need for it. No, I think what's demeaning
02:10:49 Is insisting that labor be done
02:10:52 When it's unnecessary. I feel like that is what demeans labor. I feel like to honor it
02:10:58 you would
02:10:59 you know
02:11:01 Expect that it'd be useful and like to simply
02:11:04 Expect that labor be done even in a context where we could
02:11:09 Choose not to do it without any loss
02:11:12 That's what what seems demeaning to me and I
02:11:16 Feel like Marx is is pro-automation in that sense and he I think I think he would agree with me
02:11:23 It sometimes it's fun to like dig a hole and plant a flower by yourself
02:11:28 Um, but it doesn't mean that there should not be automated ways to do it
02:11:34 Right as well. Right
02:11:36 You should have the freedom
02:11:38 To not be required
02:11:40 To or to to to dig the hole
02:11:43 But you can if you want to that's that's kind of what the ar thing
02:11:48 is. Yeah, I mean I
02:11:50 absolutely
02:11:52 Don't overdo it. No do overdo it. I mean I don't overdo it because because by definition that's like
02:11:58 doing too much of it, but like
02:12:01 Do do as much as you do as much as you can do as much as automate as much as you can get away with without
02:12:07 incurring any consequences
02:12:10 whether that be like legal
02:12:12 in that you're stealing someone's work or
02:12:15 uh, you know
02:12:17 Aesthetic and that like, you know the the piece you're making suffers because ai is not equal to the task of producing the thing you wanted to produce
02:12:25 um
02:12:27 Yeah, I don't know man. I I think it's Marxist as hell and I stand by everything I've said
02:12:31 Yeah, automation good work bad. No high no hyperbole
02:12:35 um
02:12:37 But and if it's a task that you want you simply want to do if you just want to draw a picture
02:12:42 I mean, I would argue that that's not work. That's that's leisure
02:12:46 Which is good leisure is good
02:12:48 Yeah, uh work work is
02:12:51 effort expended and you know to produce
02:12:54 Value to generate some sort of like economic
02:12:57 Return I think
02:12:59 um
02:13:00 Next one is called another question

02:18:29 You can revive from the dead and make funny slime oids
02:18:33 To say you beat in the game you would have to do all these things as quickly as possible
02:18:38 Ending with a total of 20 mega slime
02:18:41 For years players have attempted to push the game to its limits and finish faster and faster
02:18:46 So they never have to play that shit-ass game again

02:20:56 I've definitely heard it in other videos. I've heard it in an anime or two. I think
02:21:01 Really?
02:21:02 It's the sort of thing that would play and it's like, uh, beautiful scenery
02:21:07 I'm pretty sure I've seen at least one show have that as like a
02:21:12 Like an actual thing. Hmm. I I associated specifically with youtube
02:21:17 I mean, it isn't like it's a very old song
02:21:20 So there's probably lots of things that it's in

02:22:15 Basically the
02:22:18 I guess he's he sort of bears a passing resemblance to munchie. I kind of see it but like not like
02:22:24 To a degree that I find uh, unusual. No, it looks more like some other guy
02:22:30 Yeah, um, it's uh, he uh, sam bank. fdx was the big crypto exchange that like was
02:22:37 I think a couple like a month or two ago like went completely belly up because it turned out the whole thing was in
02:22:42 Solvent it was all just like fraud upon fraud upon fraud
02:22:46 Uh, and it was like like billions and billions of dollars were just like
02:22:50 Embezzled and like disappeared uh, and this this this sam bankman freed guy was like the CEO of it
02:22:57 And he was like
02:22:58 He's like a 20-something guy and like he would show up to like meetings and he would go on like talk shows
02:23:03 And he would be like and he would do it all in like his pajamas
02:23:05 And he would do it like all while playing league of legends and stuff

02:27:30 um
02:27:32 Okay, the next one
02:27:35 The next one is from
02:27:37 Well, it's called homogenous as too homogenous and there's an arrow and they're both vocaries
02:27:43 um
02:27:45 Hang on. Hang on. Wait a second before we listen to this. I'm gonna do something
02:27:49 Absolutely fucking insane
02:27:52 I'm gonna do something
02:27:54 Doesn't sound very ridiculous. Okay. Okay. No. No. No. This is gonna be so fucking epic
02:27:59 Um, all right. All right. I gotta put my scale. I gotta put my little kitchen scale right here on my counter
02:28:06 And then
02:28:07 All right. Here's the kicker. All right. I'm gonna turn it on
02:28:11 All right, okay, and it says low battery, but I know that it's lying the scales a piece of shit
02:28:14 It tells me it's battery is low all the time and then I just turn it on again and it works fine
02:28:19 all right, so
02:28:22 I'm gonna take some cheese
02:28:25 0.7 ounces
02:28:27 Whoa
02:28:28 0.7
02:28:30 points that I know and then I'm gonna take some pepperoni
02:28:33 It's 1.2
02:28:35 Pathetic and then I'm gonna eat it
02:28:38 And now I know exactly how much I just ate and I can put it in my calorie counting app
02:28:43 Wasn't that crazy?
02:28:47 So you weigh every bit of every morsel of food. Well, what when it's when it's something that
02:28:55 It has like variance to it
02:28:58 When it's something that like if I'm eating like
02:29:02 Serial
02:29:03 Like I measure out a cup of it and then I don't have to weigh it
02:29:07 But if it's like meat or cheese, yeah, you know weigh it you know weigh it and find out how much it is
02:29:11 I guess so
02:29:14 How else would you know how else would you know?
02:29:17 I don't I don't think about it so strictly. I just that's right. You don't think about it. That's right
02:29:23 I put in like a vague like approximation
02:29:28 Fringe
02:29:31 I'm doing science here
02:29:33 I'm doing science here. Yeah, I'm gonna do it again
02:29:37 One point. Yep 1.5. Okay. So each slice of this cheese is 0.7 ounces and each piece of this pepperoni
02:29:45 Well, how can you be sure every single slice of cheese is exactly the same?
02:29:48 Well, because I just weighed the second one
02:29:51 And it was also 0.7. You gotta weigh every single one
02:29:56 That was my last one
02:29:59 Don't they get like
02:30:02 Are you getting food all over the thing?
02:30:05 I put a paper plate on it. Oh, okay, then. I'm a genius. All right. Wasn't that crazy?
02:30:12 Uh, no, wasn't that epic? It may be epic. Thank you. Okay
02:30:19 These are my leftovers my leftovers from the new year's party

02:35:02 Wait a minute. We have to download that one
02:35:05 Okay, there we go. The next one's called zero three two one go
02:35:10 What's the best digibro video best digibro video
02:35:15 Hmm
02:35:18 The best digibro video
02:35:21 Probably measurement man
02:35:24 That's not digibro. That's modal soul
02:35:26 but
02:35:28 uh
02:35:29 Dang it. I mean there is no good video then
02:35:33 I mean unless I mean, I don't know I
02:35:35 I was thinking of ones on the main channel. Yeah, like about an anime
02:35:40 or something
02:35:41 I I would say
02:35:43 I mean, um
02:35:45 If it counts as one video, I guess I would probably say the asterisk war sucks is pretty good. Um
02:35:52 Is there another one that's like comparable to that?
02:35:55 There was this sort out online
02:35:57 sucks
02:35:58 Your anime sucks series. There's a couple asterisk war is asterisk war is better
02:36:04 Asterisk war is the best version of that
02:36:07 I like that one and then um, the the mamoru oshii
02:36:12 a career
02:36:14 Like history one is pretty good. That was that's the last good digibro video
02:36:19 Yeah, I I can't remember any specifics except for the big ones like the
02:36:25 The we have accepted mediocrity was pretty good. I think
02:36:30 You know what?
02:36:31 I'm gonna say in hindsight it actually wasn't good
02:36:34 Because it came from a place of she had no idea what she was talking about and like she didn't mean anything that she said
02:36:40 Yeah, I like the video though. It's very well edited. Davoo did a good job
02:36:48 I actually I'll be honest. I kind of don't really even remember like what happens in that video
02:36:55 It is it is it is a rambling thought stream of consciousness, but it's it's a cool experience because of the editing
02:37:03 Hmm when it comes to like an analysis of an anime
02:37:06 I
02:37:09 Mean I don't really watch the enemies that are talked about so it's hard for me to remember
02:37:14 Yeah, I never really watched the ones that were like here are my thoughts about an anime because I don't
02:37:20 Yeah, wasn't don't watch them how to tell if an anime is bad in just one episode that got a lot of views
02:37:25 I don't remember if I enjoyed it. I don't think that one's as good. I mean that one's fine
02:37:30 It's just it's just a recommendation for like oh drop shows early if you aren't enjoying them. Yeah
02:37:36 Yeah, I mean, okay. I have I have no issue with that
02:37:38 What was the one about like like steins gate versus regular gate?
02:37:45 Oh, it was a show called gate that had a really bad intro
02:37:49 And it was about like the the knights of yore and the tanks
02:37:53 Fighting what wasn't that the how to tell a bad because because how to tell a bad
02:37:58 No, how to tell a good anime is the one with that's about steins gate
02:38:02 I just remember there was a steins gate versus regular gate and that was a funny joke
02:38:08 Because it's not called regular gate
02:38:11 It's called gay vaguely. I vaguely remember that one
02:38:14 um, I'm gonna go with I'm gonna go with asterisk war sucks and
02:38:19 The mamoru oshii I can't I can't really think of another are there
02:38:23 Are there any other videos that she did that were like the mamoru oshii like the story of this guy's career because like
02:38:31 Did you do one about hidi eki ano?
02:38:34 I don't recall one about him, but um, there was this one about this
02:38:39 Uh painter or like background artist
02:38:42 Who's you know, like oh that that guy I don't remember his name
02:38:48 Oh, that rings a bell
02:38:50 Just looking through like the the backgrounds of this particular anime background artist
02:38:57 Because nobody thinks about background guys
02:39:02 But I you know
02:39:04 If you remember thinking
02:39:06 I think I remember feeling positively about that one. I'll didn't leave a huge impression on me
02:39:11 Okay, I think we've answered this question sufficiently. Yeah next one is called hey man
02:39:17 Uh, hey man cool podcast three two one go
02:39:22 Dude Ben, why didn't you tell me what a podcast dude? I'm gonna kill myself. I'm gonna kill myself
02:39:28 I live in fear of this the hypocrite and the cum zone guy
02:39:32 That's awesome. Like hey, you want to come on my podcast sometime? I think it'll be great and I'll pay your share of the rent
02:39:39 For that. Oh, well, okay. Maybe I can show to like, you know promote the ben's roommates podcast
02:39:46 Hey, oh and steve said we need more tp. You're good for it, right?
02:39:50 Thanks, dude
02:39:52 I mean
02:39:53 I mean this was supposed to be a parody but like if he's gonna pay my share of the rent like fuck
02:39:57 Yeah, you can come on my stupid podcast like yeah, of course
02:40:01 I like the fact that they know hypocrite and the cum zone guy, but they don't know you
02:40:10 I think yeah, I mean I think
02:40:14 Yeah, if they knew if they knew both of those people I think they would definitely know me that's probably true
02:40:19 uh
02:40:24 I mean
02:40:26 I'll just say it again like
02:40:28 Yeah, if someone wants to pay me money if someone wants to pay me money to be on my podcast or have me on their podcast like I'm
02:40:35 I'm more than amenable
02:40:37 to such thing
02:40:39 So you don't don't get the wrong idea. I'm not here to not sell out. Okay. Let's make that abundantly clear
02:40:46 Um, next one is called. Well, it's an integer. It's an integer link. Yeah
02:40:51 Let's say I made this episode's thumbnail
02:40:55 Didn't unless maybe he did let's see
02:40:59 um
02:41:01 What I think they're they're assuming we'll talk about brazil
02:41:06 Why would I talk about brazil because the the new guy is like
02:41:11 Left leaning and the bad guy the the guy who lost is like refusing to admit it and there's like some news about that
02:41:17 But I haven't really been keeping up with it
02:41:19 I guess I did um sort of hear about I didn't realize they had had like
02:41:24 Right, they had to do like a runoff election, right
02:41:27 I have no idea. I just know that the the old guy is like cranky about it. He's like pissed
02:41:33 I know that they had an I think they had an election and lula like won
02:41:37 But he won by such a narrow margin that like it didn't count so they had to do like a a revote
02:41:42 which has now
02:41:44 Turned out that has won again
02:41:46 And I mean I did yeah, I did want that to happen, but like I'm not I'm not following the story that closely
02:41:51 I don't know who these girls are. Why is this playing on the on the thing?
02:41:56 I don't know man
02:41:57 I don't know is wait swing swinging a mess with this thumbnail
02:42:01 Try again try again
02:42:04 uh
02:42:05 Submit one every week
02:42:07 Until we use it and then you win
02:42:10 Uh next one is another integer link
02:42:14 Uh-huh
02:42:16 Some cake it's time for some cake my dear. It's time for some cake my dear. It's time for some cake my dear
02:42:21 Um, I still don't know what these drawings are from
02:42:25 Have we not got any like comments?
02:42:28 You know about it
02:42:31 I have not
02:42:33 I I never I didn't uh read the
02:42:36 Comments on last weeks or two weeks ago's episode yet. I've kind of been meaning to and I haven't done it
02:42:40 So maybe somebody did
02:42:43 Say an answer, but I haven't seen one
02:42:46 And yeah, I still don't know
02:42:49 Uh, and I I know
02:42:51 Somebody somebody knows somebody knows what this what these these
02:42:56 Big boob cat girl ms paint characters are from
02:43:00 Uh, but it's not me next one is called sorry if it is too fast. Also. Do you know good text to speech?
02:43:08 three two one go
02:43:11 I'm so baffled and frustrated with all this AI art today
02:43:13 Artists who stand against AI art are like workers who stand against automated factories
02:43:17 No, shit. It is bad for you, but guess what it is good for humanity
02:43:20 Let's imagine a scenario where AI development is so rapid and good that it can literally replace an artist
02:43:24 Like you think of an image and it creates it from your head or even better and stylizes it and you can transform it in any sort of way
02:43:29 How is this bad for artists? Sure, you maybe don't have a career anymore
02:43:32 But now directors writers programmers and authors can quickly and affordably create any visualization they need
02:43:36 It frees aspiring non-visual creators from necessity of having a bunch of money and connections to make their work seem
02:43:41 In the old day musicians could not record without gatekeepers or record labels who would give them access to recording studio
02:43:45 Now digital software costs nothing and allow you to produce top-notch recordings
02:43:48 The same is with art
02:43:50 But benefiters are other creative people having said that artists are not just factory workers
02:43:54 They are creators too
02:43:55 Yeah, I cannot replace them 100%
02:43:58 Because even as hired contractor artists job can be to elaborate on design produce concepts experiment
02:44:02 I personally have an artist that makes art for my video game
02:44:04 And there's so much creativity that he brings even though I have a pretty solid vision of how things should be
02:44:07 And if I can replace such artists too aimed at almost the real intelligence
02:44:11 And if it is a final point of AI development
02:44:13 It seems like those artists from art station flash mob want to sacrifice the ultimate progress of humanity for the sake of their job security
02:44:18 How painful
02:44:19 Who will god i mistake on this podcast his opinion on such topics was always so on the other side from years that it created interesting conversations
02:44:25 who will
02:44:26 Wait, what was that last bit?
02:44:29 Uh, I wish Nate was on the podcast because his opinion was so different from your guys that would create interesting conversations
02:44:36 And then he said it. Ooh
02:44:42 I guess I mean, what do you mean like?
02:44:44 I don't think he would be on these opposites. It wouldn't be on the opposite side for me. I think we'd be on the same
02:44:49 I think he was probably
02:44:51 Well, you know, actually, I don't I don't know
02:44:53 I think he would probably agree with me that automation is good
02:44:56 I think that the reason I push back against it is just because
02:45:01 Um, I think it's good to argue for your job security
02:45:05 because
02:45:06 Uh, yeah, what are you gonna do if there's no way for you to make money?
02:45:11 That sucks
02:45:12 There's no there's no system in in place to allow for people
02:45:17 To be okay with their job security being threatened
02:45:20 They need money to live and they need a lot of money because things are so expensive right now because of the war and other things
02:45:26 I would say I mean, I I guess the one
02:45:29 Thing I would maybe say about that is that uh, it's it is yeah, I do think it is good
02:45:35 Even though even though it might cost some people jobs
02:45:38 I do think it is good
02:45:39 To remove the need for it's it's a net good to remove the need for labor
02:45:43 Even if it eliminates jobs because I think reducing the need for labor is good with with the understanding
02:45:49 That like the thing that replaces that labor can't be privately owned by some
02:45:55 Capitalist it has to be something that
02:45:57 It has to be available to
02:45:59 people yeah in
02:46:01 In a in a demo like like what the bitcoin people say what the what the ai people say that it's democratizing art like yeah
02:46:08 If it actually does that that's good
02:46:10 It it doesn't do that if like you own the software and it's proprietary or if anyone owns it
02:46:15 If it is out there and anyone can use it and it makes things more. Yeah kind of like
02:46:19 studio a soft software music software studio
02:46:23 Made it possible for people to make stuff that could have made it before
02:46:27 Then yeah, it isn't that good even if
02:46:30 It's bad for some people so I agree listen to caveat, but um
02:46:35 My problem is mostly with capitalism when it comes to like ai making things easier, then yeah, I'd agree
02:46:42 Yeah, like generally yes
02:46:47 Because like
02:46:49 I mean
02:46:51 I don't know. What do you what do you think would would you use a software that like you didn't have to like draw you could just
02:46:59 Type in some prompts and it wouldn't steal anyone's work or anything
02:47:02 But it would just like use some smart things to like just know what you were thinking and like produce the image you were imagining in your head
02:47:08 um, yeah, I would
02:47:10 if there's no like victim and
02:47:13 It's saving me
02:47:16 I don't know like moving my arms around or needing to to be better at drawing
02:47:21 If it if it's like oh you put this chip on the side of your head and you can imagine something and it will appear as an image
02:47:27 It's like that's that would be great. I would love that
02:47:30 I
02:47:31 might use it sometimes. I think um
02:47:35 I do think that like draw actually drawing yourself
02:47:40 Probably creates a sensibility
02:47:44 That is irreplaceable in terms of like appreciating
02:47:50 Aesthetics and that that aesthetic sense is part of what would let you imagine an appealing image in the first place
02:47:58 also, I mean the
02:48:01 Sometimes an image is enhanced by like especially in physical media like
02:48:06 The physical material that produces it sometimes like the texture of that material
02:48:11 forms a part of the
02:48:14 Image and it's aesthetic and enhances it and AI can't replicate that unless you build a robot to do it in physical
02:48:22 media
02:48:23 I would still I would still get
02:48:25 It's it's the same way that like, you know, we ascribe value to things
02:48:31 Arbitrarily and if you know something is hand drawn
02:48:35 um, as opposed to AI generated
02:48:39 There's there's just an in like
02:48:41 The viewer the audience will ascribe meaning
02:48:45 Based on that to the to work like even if it's an identical thing
02:48:50 If a computer if a computer can identically create something people
02:48:54 generally just have affection for
02:48:57 things that are more personal
02:49:00 So like yeah, I would I would still draw just because I I like drawing and it's nice to see something that I did
02:49:07 If I could imagine if I'm like, oh, I'm listening to this song
02:49:10 And I'm imagining a music video and if I could turn that into a real music video
02:49:14 That would be great because doing all of that extra work to really make a music video for that
02:49:20 song
02:49:22 would be like months and months of
02:49:25 Backbreaking labor that I don't want to do
02:49:27 Right. I mean, I mean, do you do you think like when you see a music video and you like it?
02:49:32 Do you think like, oh, I really appreciate what I really appreciate about this music video
02:49:36 Is that I know that a team of like two dozen people
02:49:39 Had to like, you know spend weeks and weeks like getting together in a warehouse and setting up sets and setting up shots
02:49:45 And choreographing it all and setting and someone had to edit it and someone no
02:49:50 Yeah, I mean, I don't think that but like I I think that
02:49:54 It would matter to me for I don't really feel that way about drawing
02:49:58 Like because things that you're drawing yourself. Yeah. Yeah, like if I felt like a computer was
02:50:04 I mean, it's a it's a weird hypothetical because it's like
02:50:09 At what point is it really
02:50:12 The computer if it's my imagination like I don't know how
02:50:16 Yeah, if you I mean you have you have full you have complete control over what the image is
02:50:21 You don't actually have to draw it, but the computer can just translate yet
02:50:25 Can just translate your thoughts exactly onto like like like the way I imagine it in like right now
02:50:31 Is I I imagine the drawing in my head and then I use my motor
02:50:35 Skills with my penmanship to create the drawing with my arm
02:50:40 And then using a computer
02:50:42 Like interpreters a different way of doing this exact same thing
02:50:47 So I guess I wouldn't feel differently about that
02:50:51 I think yeah, I think if if if I like I I could imagine a scenario where
02:50:57 I would just want something to be legitimate
02:51:00 Because I know everything is AI generated and I just feel like it would be it'll feel a little special
02:51:06 I if something was not that
02:51:08 I do think I mean
02:51:11 Art out of adversity. I I do feel like the the limitations
02:51:15 And the compromises that come from
02:51:18 producing an image
02:51:19 Especially in a in a physical medium is like is air is air does give something irreplaceable and and AI can never replicate that
02:51:30 Uh, that's not
02:51:32 And that's something that's mostly in like in like painting
02:51:35 um
02:51:37 Digit if you're drawing digitally
02:51:39 Still I think there are you know
02:51:41 You just people talk about like like happy accidents like sometimes you'll be drawing and you'll draw something that you didn't mean to draw
02:51:47 You make a mark you you live the line some way and it looks good
02:51:52 By accident and then you go oh, I kind of like that and then you just go with it
02:51:57 And you know those kind of things only happen if you are
02:52:00 Fumbling around with your fallible human machine that you are attempting attempting to manipulate
02:52:06 in order to uh
02:52:07 Give instructions to your computer to interpret into an image on screen
02:52:12 Um, I think that kind of stuff is not
02:52:15 Reproducible by AI. That's the kind of thing that a person does. Yeah, I also think that the argument that
02:52:24 Like AI is is is like being held back by artists
02:52:30 it I feel like AI is not
02:52:33 trying to progress
02:52:35 Enough in the in that way because it really it still currently relies on stealing artwork
02:52:41 in order to train itself
02:52:44 And people use the ability to steal artwork
02:52:48 Um to like get a specific artist style and then make money off of selling
02:52:53 I would say it's it's maybe not exactly a lot of grifters in the scene that are sort of also holding it back in a different way
02:53:00 They're not they're not thinking
02:53:03 Maybe in the future we could imagine things and make them real because
02:53:07 They just want to make money right now
02:53:10 Yeah, yeah
02:53:12 and that's
02:53:14 If like if that's the
02:53:16 When that's that's the whatever we have now cannot be the end point because it sucks
02:53:21 It is not
02:53:23 It's not good enough. No, it's not good enough
02:53:26 It's it's not it's not good enough
02:53:30 As far as I can see it's not really good enough that it can exist as like a standalone thing
02:53:36 That produces things on its own it needs to be
02:53:39 It can all it can only be used as a tool in like interpreting
02:53:43 An artist's work and extrapolating from an artist's work and to do you either have to produce what it is interpreting
02:53:49 Or you have to steal it from someone else and interpret what something someone else made and seems like that's where it's at
02:53:57 Um, which is fine. Um, I mean not the stealing part
02:54:02 Okay, uh, I think you want to go to the next one. Yeah
02:54:06 You there? Yeah. Okay. Uh, next one is the cringis three two one go
02:54:12 Yeah, what job is she?
02:54:13 He tell me
02:54:15 Kringis bingus the third. Yes
02:54:20 Confrontational cringis
02:54:23 Okay
02:54:25 This week I cranked at
02:54:29 The latest episode of the pcp
02:54:32 No, fuck you Ben made a fool of himself from the comics. Oh my god. It was kind of cringe. Fuck you
02:54:41 I do this for you
02:54:45 Alice in borderland season two
02:54:48 It's really good
02:54:51 Kring confrontational Kringis signing out
02:54:55 Borderlands the game. I guess so I haven't played it
02:55:00 But I've seen it
02:55:02 Uh
02:55:04 I didn't know deadly comics thinks I'm cool
02:55:08 When I asked him why don't girls like me he thought I appreciate this man's honesty
02:55:14 He's relatable
02:55:21 People don't understand that I'm doing a bit people don't understand that anytime I do anything embarrassing
02:55:26 It's a it's just a bit just a character and I did it. I was just playing a character
02:55:32 I was just doing a bit. I was doing it to get a laugh
02:55:35 And if you don't appreciate that then you don't deserve it, okay
02:55:39 Then I'll cry if you don't appreciate that then I'll cry you shit myself. I'll cry a little bit
02:55:45 Yes, I will cry. Yes, I'll cry out of pity for you. I'll cry out of pity for that
02:55:48 You don't get my human humor. You can't appreciate it
02:55:52 And I'll shit myself
02:55:53 in protest
02:55:55 It'll be deliberate
02:55:57 And it'll be a part of the bit, but you won't get it
02:56:01 You'll go it'll go way over your head. Okay. Next one is called. It's too big for my own good always cause a tiny bit of bleh
02:56:10 blue
02:56:11 What a world at humble brag dot com three two one go
02:56:15 What does your perfect christmas look like?
02:56:18 Mine looks like doing my wife by the fire
02:56:22 And not hurting her massive penis
02:56:31 That would be a christmas miracle
02:56:33 I I missed what he said. He said what does your perfect christmas look like?
02:56:37 Mine looks like doing my wife by the fire and not hurting her with my massive penis
02:56:42 Oh, I thought he said not hurting her a massive penis. I thought it was a twist. I think
02:56:48 He's saying he hurts her. He's humble bragging about his penis is too large to
02:56:54 Engage in copulation with his
02:56:57 wife without uh causing injury
02:57:01 That's abuse that's spousal abuse right there. Not if she's gonna have to quit quit it
02:57:05 You're gonna have to cut it out
02:57:07 Not if not if she's you're gonna have to hit it and quit it my friends
02:57:10 Not if she likes it and is consent there's consent for injury
02:57:15 Then it's good actually

02:57:38 You know, that must be really hard on you
02:57:40 Uh, next one is called moider or assassino
02:57:44 three two one go
02:57:46 I'm not a crazed gunman. I'm an assassin
02:57:50 Well, one is the job and the other's mental sickness
02:57:54 Thank you for your
02:57:55 Reference. What is that a reference to I've heard that before it's from the tf2 meet the sniper video
02:58:03 You know those it's not even it's not even that funny of a line really
02:58:07 Yeah, I mean it's okay. It's characterization
02:58:11 um
02:58:12 Next one is uh
02:58:14 My name's your link. Yes. There we go. Uh, don't do a reverse image search of this picture worst mistake of my life
02:58:24 I can't do it on firefox. How do you do it? Well now I gotta do it
02:58:30 I mean, I'm seeing a bunch of the same images
02:58:33 I'm seeing a bunch of other
02:58:36 pictures of dinosaurs
02:58:38 Oh, I just realized the murder or assassin thing was referencing when we were talking about that in that previous episode
02:58:45 Like what is considered a murder or an assassination?
02:58:48 But that was clear that up. It's just a reference
02:58:52 Uh, okay. Well, I yeah, I do remember that actually so I see the
02:58:57 See what they're going for. Um, yeah, I'm gonna admit. I don't like see anything
02:59:03 I don't see or really see anything in the in the
02:59:07 search results
02:59:09 I mean, I almost feel like maybe I should find just the original image without the caption and reverse search that
02:59:15 Oh
02:59:18 Um, I think it might be because
02:59:21 I think it might be the name
02:59:24 What's the name it's it's uh, I think you'll understand when I say it
02:59:28 I think it is called or at least it is someone's called the niger the Niger sorus
02:59:34 You get it
02:59:36 n i g e r c a u
02:59:41 I mean, okay, he looks pretty shocked to hear this
02:59:45 Yeah, he's a fan. I can't believe they they caught like a real like like dinosaur that's alive with skin
02:59:53 Yeah, and then they called him a slur and it offended him
02:59:55 He's like you can't believe he was I can't believe he was such a live
02:59:58 Okay, it is a real dinosaur. Okay. All right. I get it because it was discovered in
03:00:03 Niger gado gado fawah in Niger. Yeah somewhere
03:00:08 Well, that was a funny joke. Uh, you got me
03:00:13 Uh, the next one the dinosaur youtube guy loves those silly little pictures three two one go
03:00:20 Hey y'all, it's fucking
03:00:23 4 20 in the morning. Let's go. Let's go. I just finished the eight hour unique name of sorus video because I hate myself
03:00:32 And I'm an idiot not the dinosaur guy even though he has sorus and it was bad. It was a fucking fugue
03:00:39 I don't know what to do
03:00:42 Every now and then he'd talk about the folding ideas line go up and it was like a moment of clarity of like
03:00:48 Oh, that's a point that makes sense
03:00:50 And then he'd just show more he showed so many tweets. I know you're probably sick of talking about this
03:00:56 but I was like
03:00:58 Is it as bad as they say?
03:01:01 I guess. Um, yeah, I mean I haven't watched it and I never will my
03:01:06 Impression of it is that yeah most of his argument boils down to like some people said some things that he thinks are mean
03:01:14 Hmm and that that makes NFTs good actually because people that don't like NFTs are mean
03:01:21 Yes, I remember
03:01:24 Skipping around to see if he mentioned the line goes up video
03:01:30 Yeah, and then he did and his response to something was like, well, that's stupid actually
03:01:34 So I was like, okay. Do you remember what it was? I don't remember. I don't remember
03:01:38 I think it was just sort of like a weird
03:01:41 Interpretation of what dan Olson was saying
03:01:44 And so I'm like, okay. I can disregard this whole video. And so I didn't watch the entire thing
03:01:49 the um
03:01:50 It's funny when you say the dinosaur youtube guy, I do not think of unique nemosaurus. I think of tray the explainer
03:01:56 Do you know tray the explainer?
03:01:58 No
03:02:00 I mean he has a
03:02:02 Fucking dinosaur
03:02:06 Does he explain that
03:02:08 Uh, probably
03:02:11 Probably at some point, uh, he's good. He does a lot of like like archaeology
03:02:16 And like history and like anthropology sort of stuff. Uh, and he's good
03:02:21 Next one is called one of adult swim unmisses three two one go

03:02:52 Okay, now I've seen this somewhere
03:02:56 Oh michael cusack
03:02:58 I'm gonna be honest
03:03:01 I do not looking at it my immediate impression is that I do not want to watch it
03:03:07 Michael cusack is the guy uh, half of smiling friends. Yes

03:03:32 It's got that look about it. It's got that look about it. That is so
03:03:36 It looks like looks like one of these fucking uh, you know adult animation with uh, you know
03:03:43 Simple animation and I have nothing against that other than every fucking show looks like that
03:03:50 And I just hate media
03:03:52 Yeah, when are they gonna make when are they gonna make um, uh, uh

03:04:30 Oh, it's like it's just talking about whoever came before
03:04:35 This one is called at killer prince
03:04:38 Does he does he know that prince isolation roasted him like how would he know that?
03:04:44 uh
03:04:46 A e-guest is a big guest. It paid off though
03:04:52 Well killer there's no killer prince prince is a rowdy
03:04:56 So what's going on? Is this just a weird coincidence? I'm not probably okay
03:05:01 Well, the next one is an imager. So let's fucking look at it. Why don't we teacher?
03:05:07 I'm giving you easy homework this time even a complete dumbass will be able to solve it
03:05:12 Kid named complete dumbass
03:05:16 If you're

03:05:45 Okay, this is um

03:06:05 rollouts that maximize growth in the shortest time frame
03:06:08 And I would be happy to do it for $40. Why $40? I know the the cornering said he would do it for free
03:06:14 Uh, well, you know, he's got some dignity $40 worth. I have I have exactly $40 worth more dignity than
03:06:24 Than the quartering that sounds about right
03:06:26 Anyway, next one is uh, I can make the sound better, but the explanation was great in
03:06:32 three two one go
03:06:35 All right. So what you're gonna do is take your dominant hand
03:06:40 pinch your own cheek
03:06:42 The closest to the hand
03:06:44 a little bit back
03:06:47 Not on the
03:06:48 right beside the mouth
03:06:51 You open your mouth on the same direction only a little bit
03:06:56 and you pull it
03:06:58 and
03:06:59 reach back and repeat
03:07:05 Not it I get it. No
03:07:08 Uh

03:10:22 Uh
03:10:24 Haven't seen that picture in a while
03:10:26 That was from
03:10:28 Probably like 2017 or something
03:10:31 Wow 100 years ago that approximately a hundred years ago
03:10:36 uh
03:10:37 next one
03:10:40 Lamal next one is an
03:10:43 Injure album. Oh my god a whole a whole freaking album. I think it's just one image. Yeah, okay
03:10:49 Sasuke
03:10:53 When are they gonna get back to Sasuke? When are they gonna get back to him?
03:10:58 I mean true. That's this fucking tiger man. Probably some filler episode loser
03:11:04 That's what happened. It's just like Sasuke left
03:11:08 They tried to get him back. They failed and then there was a bunch of filler until shippuden
03:11:13 No, I mean there was a bunch of filler in shippuden
03:11:19 No, no, no, there was like two like a hundred or something episodes. Maybe not that many
03:11:25 Um between the ending of the arc where Naruto
03:11:30 uh, neji
03:11:32 Choji
03:11:33 Fucking dog boy and uh, shikamaru. They all go to get Sasuke back
03:11:40 And I maybe messed up who was there, but like they fight a bunch of urochumaru's like underlings and stuff
03:11:49 and uh, they don't and then it ends with um
03:11:54 I think it ends with Naruto and Sasuke at the waterfall and they have that epic battle. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and then that's like the end of
03:12:02 Main Naruto, right?
03:12:04 Yeah, but in the anime there's a bunch of episodes after that, which is nothing
03:12:08 That's the filler like dead zone. I'm like, when are they why are you fucking around?
03:12:12 I just watched them all because I didn't know what filler was
03:12:16 I thought it was all important
03:12:20 I like this little stick figure of my icon my pony icon
03:12:25 All right next one

03:20:52 Yeah, but what flavor though if it's if it's
03:20:55 If it's cran raspberry, uh, if it's if it's tropical, I would if it's tropical. I would probably go for it

03:21:33 Minecraft
03:21:36 PCP
03:21:38 Uh
03:21:39 Minecraft
03:21:40 Yeah, because I said last time
03:21:42 That the server is free and open now and that's true
03:21:45 And I think the problem is just that maybe people don't know how to get to it because a couple people have asked me like
03:21:49 How do I get into the server?
03:21:51 So I'll just put a link in the description to like click that and it will join you to the
03:21:56 mind the pcb Minecraft server
03:21:58 And I think you will have access once you're in there, but if not, I'm sure maren can just give you the role
03:22:04 Because because to get it you have to get in there and you have there's a whole there's like a document
03:22:09 There's posts that explain how you install it
03:22:12 uh, and then
03:22:14 You know, that's the the hard part
03:22:16 so, uh
03:22:17 Just in case anyone wants that wants to get jump into the pcb server, which is free now
03:22:22 Belongs to the people. Yes. Um, I will link it. I will link that in the description
