00:00:00 You're gonna go to the record store, you're gonna give them all your money.
00:00:04 Radio plays what they want you to hear, so it's cool, I just don't believe it.
00:00:09 Sell out with me, oh yeah, sell out with me tonight.
00:00:14 The record company's only giving me lots of money and everything's gonna be alright.
00:00:20 Hello, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:32 Everybody go crazy!
00:00:34 Woohoo!
00:00:35 Yay!
00:00:36 Alright!
00:00:37 I love my arms when I come up with it.
00:00:38 I like dig.
00:00:39 The topic today is the most bestest one there has ever been, selling out everything, giving
00:00:47 it all away, and I'm gonna do the thing we haven't done in a million years, I'm gonna
00:00:50 read the Urban Dictionary definition, cause it's cool for this one.
00:00:54 Alright, to compromise one's values and or artistic vision in order to gain fame and
00:00:59 or monetary profit, commonplace in today's musical society, it is rare to find a successful
00:01:04 musical artist who has not sold out, however this is not to say that they do not exist.
00:01:10 And that's it.
00:01:11 That was a bunch of unnecessary bullshit.
00:01:12 Was that the end?
00:01:13 Yeah.
00:01:14 But, I don't know, anyway, I'm just gonna state my opinion right now, selling out is
00:01:20 the only way to live your life.
00:01:21 If you're not selling out, you're doing it wrong.
00:01:23 Do we not introduce everybody anymore?
00:01:24 Artistic integrity is dead.
00:01:25 It needs to be buried.
00:01:26 What?
00:01:27 What?
00:01:28 Do we not introduce everybody anymore on the spot?
00:01:29 Oh shit, I totally forgot.
00:01:30 Jesus Christ!
00:01:31 Alright!
00:01:32 Alright, we got the Patreon.com slash Ben St.

00:02:06 Alright, endless jessicles, Greek warrior.
00:02:09 We're the pussy gangsters, give me some macaroni.
00:02:12 And me bestie boy, your favorite guy.
00:02:17 Okay, so you already heard what I have to say, who's got an opinion on selling out?
00:02:21 Jesse, what do you think about selling out?
00:02:22 I want to hear what you have to say.
00:02:23 I was going to say something, but I got confused because you fucking started introducing us.
00:02:27 Okay, we'll say it now.
00:02:30 So, yeah, it's, so selling out to me is just, yeah, when someone compromises their values
00:02:37 or their intent for greater success or marketability or whatever, but here's an interesting conundrum.
00:02:45 What if your intent is to sell out?
00:02:48 What if your values are making money and that's all that you care about?
00:02:51 Case in point, Man Child Incorporated.
00:02:53 Yes, yeah, yeah, that's right.
00:02:55 So Man Child Incorporated is essentially just a parody of selling out, but it's not a very
00:03:01 good parody because I'm incapable of not making good videos.
00:03:04 Yes, it's one flaw.
00:03:06 He can't sell out hard enough.
00:03:07 Yeah, like the idea was, yeah, all the videos are going to be really bad and stupid, but
00:03:11 isn't possible.
00:03:12 Everything I do is gold.
00:03:13 Right, yeah, when was the last Man Child Incorporated video?
00:03:18 Oh, so long.
00:03:19 So long.
00:03:20 Like February.
00:03:21 Oh, no.
00:03:22 What was that, Ben?
00:03:23 You said that all dismissively, like I haven't made a good video since then, let me tell
00:03:27 you something.
00:03:28 I think that's exactly what Ben would say.
00:03:29 Listen, buddy!
00:03:30 Listen, buddy!
00:03:32 You know, I may be a dick, Jesse, but I say that because I miss Colt Corona is what I
00:03:39 really miss.
00:03:40 And I want to know what happens with that fucking scepter and crown.
00:03:43 He's still in the furnace room.
00:03:44 He won't come out.
00:03:45 Jesse, Jesse, Jesse, tell us about the light in the furnace room.
00:03:50 Oh yeah, yeah, so there's this meme going around that Colt Corona is fictional.
00:03:57 I don't know where it came from, but people just don't believe in him, even though he's
00:04:03 clearly there on video all the time, or at least he used to be before he barricaded himself
00:04:07 in the furnace room and started calling a horse you haven't.
00:04:10 He's out of his fucking mind, but you know, sometimes just to prove it even more so, sometimes
00:04:15 I'll be walking around my room and that damn light will be on in there.
00:04:17 I didn't turn that damn light on.
00:04:19 That light is just on sometimes.
00:04:21 And so there's your proof right there.
00:04:22 I put that down.
00:04:23 There you go.
00:04:24 If you pause the video and you freeze-frame it at this one frame, you'll see a beam of
00:04:28 light that couldn't possibly be computer-generated.
00:04:30 And if you look in the background of the video...
00:04:34 And then Jeff made reference to something that one of Jesse's stupid-ass fans did that
00:04:39 we were trying to keep underwrapped so that nobody else would make the same mistake.
00:04:43 Oh no, you motherfucker!
00:04:45 Stop!
00:04:46 Everyone stop!
00:04:47 Shut up right now!
00:04:48 Whoever the fuck is editing this, if you don't take that shit out, I will come down
00:04:51 on you with the fury of a thousand gods!
00:04:53 Thank you, Jeff, for even saying that!
00:04:54 I'm legitimately pissed off right now!
00:04:56 God damn it!
00:04:57 God damn it!
00:04:58 God damn it!
00:04:59 HIPPO, HIPPO, HIPPO!
00:05:00 You were saying something a while back.
00:05:01 What were you saying?
00:05:02 Yeah, yeah, it's about the topic at hand, actually.
00:05:05 Okay, okay, go on.
00:05:07 There's one thing that a lot of, like, YouTubers have done to sort of make selling out or like
00:05:13 selling stuff in general more palatable to people, which I'm kind of sick of.
00:05:18 It's making it into a joke every single time.
00:05:22 Like, lol, look at me, I'mma sell out, whoa!
00:05:25 Yeah, let's you have your fake eating too, it lets you sell out, but if you're kind of
00:05:30 self-aware about it, it's okay, it's funny.
00:05:32 I think that's stupid.
00:05:33 I think being truly self-aware is understanding that selling out isn't a bad thing.
00:05:38 That's true, but it wasn't done yet.
00:05:40 It's not even really selling out though, they're just selling a product or promoting something
00:05:44 and they're just saying, whoa, I'm horrible and terrible, lol, buy it anyway, you know,
00:05:49 that just, I don't know.
00:05:50 I very much agree.
00:05:51 I very much agree.
00:05:52 But you know, just like, there's this thing that tons of YouTubers are doing now where
00:05:57 at the end of their videos, they'll just do a little spiel about, you know, crunchy
00:06:01 roll or a fucking loot crate, any of that, and you know, those are annoying.
00:06:05 I usually just turn off the video, I don't like them, I think the video would be better
00:06:08 without them, but they don't really bother me.
00:06:10 But just the other day, fucking George Weidman of fucking bunny shits like put at the beginning
00:06:16 of this really cool video I wanted to watch about Dark Souls 3 or something, I can't remember.
00:06:20 Like he just inserts this like two minute long speech about, I think it was loot crate,
00:06:24 it was the most obnoxious fucking thing I've ever seen in my time, I just put it at the
00:06:28 end.
00:06:29 What?
00:06:30 I gotta say, I thought that was, like, I think he's way smarter for doing it the way
00:06:36 he did, and honestly, like, here's the thing, everyone puts them at the end, no one fucking
00:06:42 watches your ad at the end of your video.
00:06:44 Yeah, cause no one wants to see them.
00:06:45 Right, exactly.
00:06:47 Which means that they're not gonna make any fucking money, which means you shouldn't
00:06:49 put the ad in there in the first place, cause you're not making anything.
00:06:51 I didn't even watch the video, cause it was so bad, I had to do something else with my
00:06:55 time.
00:06:56 Yeah, you did it, but everyone else did.
00:06:57 I did.
00:06:58 I watched the whole video, because of course I wanted to watch it, it was a 30 minute video
00:07:00 about Dark Souls.
00:07:01 But did you buy a loot crate?
00:07:03 Well, I already know about loot crate, and I've had my own advertising for them before.
00:07:07 Well, we're not really the best judge.
00:07:09 That's by far one of the biggest problems with ads on YouTube is there's so few sponsors
00:07:13 going around, Audible and Crunchyroll and Loot Crate and the toaster.
00:07:16 You see the same thing all the time.
00:07:21 T-Blocks.com where you can use promo code M-Basement 15 to get 15% off a t-shirt sent
00:07:26 straight to your door.
00:07:27 Guys, we're just gonna have to start our own merchandise and make our own company so we
00:07:31 can advertise ourselves.
00:07:32 Like, we're just, there's not enough.
00:07:33 You know, I've been kicking around an idea for a while of having a YouTuber Daki Makara
00:07:40 company.
00:07:41 Just selling Daki Makara's.
00:07:42 Oh my gosh.
00:07:43 That would make so much money.
00:07:44 Jesus fucking Christ.
00:07:45 I'm so angry thinking about how much money that would make.
00:07:50 We gotta get on it, man.
00:07:52 Just get Digibro on a pillow, and obviously, Nate, the sexiest man on a pillow is my Digibro.
00:07:58 The problem with that is, though, is for half the YouTubers out there, you'd have to have
00:08:01 double XL wide pillows for that to be practical.
00:08:04 If he's gonna make Movie Bob, just make a bedsheet like yours.
00:08:11 He'd be a couch.
00:08:13 You just gotta sell a couch.
00:08:15 I would honestly buy a Movie Bob Daki Makara.
00:08:19 Movie Bob bedspread?
00:08:20 You mean a Movie Bob futon?
00:08:23 Because that's what it would end up being.
00:08:25 Yeah, that's right.
00:08:26 Holy shit.
00:08:27 I'd wake up every day and turn to him in my sleep and nuzzle his fat Daki Makara neck
00:08:33 and say, sorry for 9-11, and he would turn back to me in my dreams and say, me too.
00:08:44 Ben, Ben, I wanted to ask you.
00:08:48 You seem to me to have something of a complex relationship with selling out, so on the one
00:08:53 hand, you seem to really hate everything that makes money for people that isn't, I don't
00:08:58 know, artistically whatever.
00:08:59 I hate everything that makes people more money than I think they deserve.
00:09:03 Yeah, okay, sure, sure.
00:09:06 But on the other hand, you'd like to go advertise your shit around places, and I mean, not
00:09:11 that that's not really selling out, but it's marketing, I guess, which is similar, I guess.
00:09:16 I try to promote myself.
00:09:18 I post my shit around in places that I think it will be seen by people who it's relevant
00:09:23 to.
00:09:25 I mean, I don't like that.
00:09:27 I don't like doing it, but it's the only way to get seen, and I accept that.
00:09:32 It's a necessary evil.
00:09:34 I don't think that's the same.
00:09:35 I think we can all agree on that.
00:09:36 I think that's part of, yeah, it's like what Jesse was saying.
00:09:40 I mean, I agreed with the first half of what Jesse was saying and not the second.
00:09:43 It's only selling out if you compromise your artistic integrity.
00:09:47 Yeah, but here's the thing.
00:09:49 I don't think advertising yourself does that.
00:09:53 That's totally unrelated to the word.
00:09:55 A lot of times, your artistic integrity isn't all that interesting anyway.
00:09:59 You have to really decide if it's worth it.
00:10:01 One of my favorite movies is that thing you do.
00:10:03 It's a Tom Hanks movie from the 90s.
00:10:05 It's about this teenage band who gets really big, and it's just a fun, happy movie about
00:10:11 them getting big, and at no point does the movie go, oh man, this is such a bad deal
00:10:17 that they're conforming to exactly what the label wants them to do.
00:10:21 It's all shown as a pretty good idea.
00:10:23 Tom Hanks plays this manager who shapes their image, and all of his ideas are good ideas,
00:10:28 even if they're artificial and they work, and then there's one character, one member of the band,
00:10:32 who's like, oh, why are we doing covers?
00:10:34 Oh, why are we controlling our image?
00:10:36 Why don't we just play our own songs, and this and this and that, and everyone hates him,
00:10:40 and he's a big penis butt jerk.
00:10:42 That's very interesting to view, and that's exactly what I wanted to talk about,
00:10:46 as opposed to like, because it's pretty obvious when you've got a dude who just sticks a big ad
00:10:50 in the middle of his video or whatever, but what's much less noticeable is the way that people
00:10:55 tailor their content, and not just by making top tens about whatever the popular thing is,
00:11:00 but by, like, Digi's gotten very good at this, about structuring his videos.
00:11:04 Yeah, the consumable chunks.
00:11:05 It always segues into talking about the pageant.
00:11:07 No, they segue, they segue.
00:11:09 No, no, no, no, if it's in a Digi video, it's a segue.
00:11:11 Fucking animal!
00:11:12 You fucking animal!
00:11:13 It's a Digi video, alright?
00:11:14 It's a Digi video.
00:11:15 It's a Digi video specifically.
00:11:18 Tell me about how much cooler Segyu sounds than Segway.
00:11:21 Tell me about that.
00:11:22 Yeah, Mother Segway makes you picture the thing.
00:11:26 Anyway, with what DeVu was saying, for an example that the rest of us know, Bakumon,
00:11:31 we were talking about it.
00:11:32 I was gonna say, that's the big one, that's the big one.
00:11:34 It's about the glory and the power and the wonderful thing that is
00:11:37 telling your content to the mass appeal.
00:11:39 Somewhere in the middle of the story, you know, Ashiro Gimudo goes to Hattori,
00:11:43 the editor, and they're like, you know, what about, you know, does being popular
00:11:47 mean it's good?
00:11:48 Like, isn't popularity independent from artistic integrity and Hattori just like,
00:11:52 look, I know a lot of people struggle with this, but I just really try not to think about it.
00:11:57 If something is popular, that means lots of people like it, which in a certain sense
00:12:01 means it's good.
00:12:02 Yeah, and like, to all the people that like it, it is good.
00:12:06 Therefore, popularity and goodness are kind of...
00:12:09 What an amazing speech that was.
00:12:10 That was like the most interesting thing to me in the entire series, but...
00:12:13 It was up there.
00:12:14 Yeah, let's go on Davoo, go on.
00:12:15 A couple of years ago, when I was getting into doing YouTube full time, right,
00:12:18 and I was really inspired by the big analytical think pieces, there were things that were
00:12:22 really deep and complex, and that was what I was into developing my skills on,
00:12:26 is doing analysis, and at a certain point, I had made a video that I thought,
00:12:30 alright, there's a lot of great analysis in here, had another video that was like,
00:12:34 alright, this is a great story that I'm weaving about a guy,
00:12:38 and now I'm like, okay, I've gotten good at the baseline skills at making videos.
00:12:45 So, from then on, what's really been exciting me since then is finding something
00:12:50 that is also really good, but is also something that's mainstream.
00:12:54 It's looking at the Venn diagram of what is great and what is popular,
00:12:58 and searching for everything that's in between, and that's what excites me.
00:13:02 That's the skills I want to develop.
00:13:03 Yeah, to relate that just to Bakumon, because Bakumon, like the Ashurigamuto,
00:13:07 understands that what they're best at is that, what's the term they use for it?
00:13:11 Serious humor.
00:13:12 Serious humor, that's exactly the word I was looking for.
00:13:15 And so their big successful series later on is like Tonto, which is like this gag series,
00:13:21 that one never really gets off, it's all their other series that play more to their strengths
00:13:25 when they can find a way to capture what they're good at, and then tailor it to the mass audience.
00:13:31 That's what it's all about.
00:13:32 I think that the way, I think that the only way to be successful and not selling,
00:13:37 like you can be successful and sell out, but there's such a thing as success without selling out.
00:13:42 And I think that happens when people, like you're making what you want to make,
00:13:48 but it also happens to be stuff that people want to see.
00:13:51 Like you have to find something that is what you want to do,
00:13:55 but that other people also want you to do.
00:13:57 And you know, in my humble opinion, I think that those people are just plain lucky to be that kind of person.
00:14:03 I mean, I'm not sure that it's really...
00:14:05 I mean, Ashiro Gimudo had to go through lots and lots of iterations before they found something that's all good.
00:14:10 Yeah, exactly. I wouldn't call them lucky at all.
00:14:12 I wouldn't call them luck, that was hard work and perseverance.
00:14:16 I'm just saying someone from the start who did that would be a lucky person.
00:14:19 Yeah, a lot of mangaka, they have like a bunch of unsuccessful series
00:14:24 before they find something that really speaks to people.
00:14:28 Like Araki made Bao before he made Jojo.
00:14:34 I forget his name, but the Master of All Manga made Magic Kaito before he made Detective Conan,
00:14:46 which is the most successful media franchise of all time or something like that.
00:14:51 It's not even close to that, but it is.
00:14:56 No, but I think it's the longest running anime of all time.
00:15:01 Probably.
00:15:02 Anime, maybe.
00:15:04 What about The Simpsons?
00:15:06 Well, I mean, of course, Matt Groening, the phenomenal mangaka,
00:15:11 who made The Simpsons and then realized that he'd sold out too much
00:15:15 and went back and made the artistic masterpiece that is Futurama.
00:15:19 Yeah.
00:15:20 Yeah, no, but like a lot of the time you do have to iterate on ideas
00:15:25 before you find something that speaks to people, unless you're a genius like me
00:15:32 and you make what's in an OP as your very first video and people just flock to you.
00:15:37 Well, Jeff, we need you to talk to you.
00:15:39 Because you're the master of selling out in this group.
00:15:42 I am.
00:15:43 Hang on.
00:15:44 I want to ask Jeff, because I've been curious about this.
00:15:46 Your content does seem very, you know, appropriate for this stuff.
00:15:50 And I want to ask, how much of being like a journalist helped you, like,
00:15:54 prepare you for your YouTube stuff?
00:15:56 I assume it was massively.
00:15:57 Oh, okay.
00:15:58 So the one thing that you guys who only ever concern yourselves with making good videos
00:16:04 that are well-edited and well-voiced acted, don't get, is that, like,
00:16:09 one of the most important things to YouTube video success is your description,
00:16:13 your tags, and your title.
00:16:15 And, like, not just in terms of clickbait, in terms of if you have keywords
00:16:20 that people are searching all the time in your description, your tags, and your title,
00:16:24 that will factor into how often you get searched.
00:16:28 So part of what has, that's something that gets drilled into your head
00:16:34 when you're a text journalist, is keywords, especially in the first two paragraphs of your article,
00:16:41 keywords, all the fuck over your title, and keywords in your tags.
00:16:46 And that means...
00:16:47 Is this specifically for search stuff?
00:16:50 Yeah, Google search stuff.
00:16:51 That in, like, collected stuff too.
00:16:55 Like, okay, when I was an animator, because I learned this as well from my text blog,
00:17:00 where, what the hell, I heard a woman's voice.
00:17:03 Jesse, are you in a Skype call at the same time or something?
00:17:07 He would be.
00:17:09 When I was doing text blogging, there was, like, a period where I was part of...
00:17:14 There's this website called Anime Something.
00:17:16 I don't remember the fucking name of it, but it was, like, an aggregator of RSS feeds.
00:17:20 So, basically, it was a website you went to, and it would be a collection of the newest posts
00:17:24 from every anime blog that was a part of that site.
00:17:27 And so, there'd, you know, be, like, hundreds of anime blogs,
00:17:30 and every time you checked, there'd be new stuff, and it was kind of like...
00:17:33 There wasn't a huge reader base for it, but if you had a brand new blog,
00:17:37 this was how you got off the ground.
00:17:39 Like, get your URL onto that site, and that way, you'll get at least, like, 30 readers, you know?
00:17:44 And then, from there, you've got a kind of word-of-mouth spread.
00:17:47 But, like, so I was on there, and at some point, I realized that, like,
00:17:51 a lot of my posts would just not get, like, any initial views,
00:17:54 and then someone messaged me, and they were like,
00:17:56 you realize that that aggregator will post the title and the first, like, paragraph of your post
00:18:03 is what it would share.
00:18:05 And with, they had, because they have advertisers,
00:18:08 you couldn't have any swear words in the title or first couple sentences.
00:18:12 Oh.
00:18:13 Oh.
00:18:14 Oh.
00:18:15 Interesting.
00:18:16 Miss Jizzabelle.
00:18:17 Hahaha.
00:18:18 Okay.
00:18:19 Wow.
00:18:20 Oh, my God, it's the promised secretary at long last.
00:18:32 This is her debut.
00:18:33 Well, welcome.
00:18:34 Welcome to the DeVoo Collective.
00:18:35 We're so happy to have you.
00:18:37 No.
00:18:38 No, she's always been here.
00:18:39 She's a representative of Endless Jess, and therefore...
00:18:42 Yeah.
00:18:43 It's the fucking...
00:18:44 She's the one who leaves.
00:18:45 If you've ever had a comment on Manchild Incorporated...
00:18:47 I thought she was the secretary of Manchild Inc.
00:18:48 Yeah.
00:18:49 I thought so, too.
00:18:50 Oh, yeah.
00:18:51 Manchild Incorporated, not Endless Jess.
00:18:52 I'm sorry, those are completely different brands,
00:18:53 from what I'm talking about.
00:18:54 This Jesson from Endless Jess.
00:18:55 You all suck.
00:18:56 Hahaha.
00:18:57 That's a fair point.
00:18:59 Holy shit.
00:19:00 Okay.
00:19:02 So, back onto the subject of SEO.
00:19:07 That is very important.
00:19:09 Wait, what's SEO?
00:19:10 Search engine optimization.
00:19:12 Oh, okay.
00:19:13 I'm such a noob.
00:19:15 Alright, Jesson.
00:19:16 YouTube is...
00:19:17 They all suck.
00:19:18 Go to hell.
00:19:19 Fuck you, especially Jeff.
00:19:20 Goodbye.
00:19:21 Is he writing you a script over there?
00:19:24 Is he like sending over like...
00:19:25 What is that?
00:19:26 Using the fucking...
00:19:27 He's writing cue cards.
00:19:28 No, he's pushing the button on his...
00:19:30 Like intercom thing, you know?
00:19:31 No, no.
00:19:32 What I'm imagining is, is Jesse sitting across the room
00:19:34 with a Morse code tapper, and she's sitting across the room
00:19:37 in front of the microphone, interpreting that,
00:19:39 writing it out, and interpreting the words,
00:19:41 and where are you getting into the mic?
00:19:42 Okay, Jeff, go on.
00:19:43 Search engine optimization.
00:19:45 Search engine optimization.
00:19:46 Because, like, what YouTube is, fundamentally,
00:19:49 is it's three things.
00:19:51 It's a video platform, obviously.
00:19:53 It's a landing page that recommends videos to you,
00:19:57 and then it's a search engine.
00:19:59 So, knowing how to game search engines
00:20:03 to get more relevant hits off of search terms
00:20:07 is super important for being successful on YouTube.
00:20:10 So can you give us the example of how you do that
00:20:12 with what's in an OP?
00:20:14 Where's my secretary, Jesse?
00:20:17 Hey!
00:20:18 Jesse.
00:20:19 Jezebel Jezemeen, what are you doing
00:20:21 conforming with these losers?
00:20:23 It's time for my goddamn butt massage.
00:20:25 Get off that stupid fucking podcast
00:20:27 you're coming with me.
00:20:28 There's a whole fucking...
00:20:29 Sorry, sir.
00:20:30 There's a whole...
00:20:31 Shut up! You don't get to talk!
00:20:32 There's a man-child narrative going on right now.
00:20:34 There's a supply.
00:20:35 I need my butt massage!
00:20:36 I need my penis massage!
00:20:38 Yeah!
00:20:39 We're out of here!
00:20:41 Oh, my God.
00:20:43 Go on, Jeff.
00:20:44 Try to force your way.
00:20:45 Yeah, so, functionally, the way that you do that
00:20:48 is you make sure to include the title
00:20:50 of whatever you're talking about
00:20:52 in either the first line of your description,
00:20:54 or your title, or ideally both.
00:20:57 Then you want to tag companies,
00:21:00 creators, musicians,
00:21:02 and anything that people might search
00:21:05 related to your thing.
00:21:07 So, oh, I left my phone on
00:21:09 because I'm a sellout, too.
00:21:10 That's the sound of selling out.
00:21:12 That's the sound of money coming in, baby!
00:21:14 That's the sound of money coming in.
00:21:15 Yep.
00:21:16 So...
00:21:17 It's a distinct Cha-ching cadence, too.
00:21:19 Yeah, that's right.
00:21:20 Yeah, only Jeff would have a Cha-ching sound.
00:21:23 I actually do, too.
00:21:24 Now that's the sellout we can believe in.
00:21:26 My text sound effect is the Cha-ching
00:21:28 from Roller Coaster Tycoon.
00:21:30 Of course.
00:21:31 That's a good sound effect.
00:21:33 Yeah, so...
00:21:35 So what you want to do,
00:21:37 like, what I do with What's in an OP
00:21:39 is I always make sure to put, you know,
00:21:42 the name of the song
00:21:45 that is the opening theme song,
00:21:49 the name of the director
00:21:51 or the mangaka who created the series,
00:21:54 the name of the company is responsible for making it,
00:21:57 the name of the series itself
00:21:59 and any possible abbreviations,
00:22:01 and usually,
00:22:03 if there's a commonly used abbreviation,
00:22:05 I'll use the short form, like FMA in the title,
00:22:09 and then I'll type Full Metal Alchemist
00:22:11 in the description within the first line
00:22:14 because that, you know, that all helps
00:22:16 with search engine optimization.
00:22:18 Yeah, Jeff, it's funny to hear you talking about this
00:22:20 because I do all of this
00:22:22 and I thought it was obvious,
00:22:24 but now I'm wondering if to everybody else,
00:22:26 this is news.
00:22:27 Well, I don't do any of this.
00:22:29 I don't do any of this shit.
00:22:31 On the subject of selling out,
00:22:33 I've been talking to people at MCNs lately,
00:22:35 and that's apparently the biggest thing
00:22:37 that they do to help people get their channels bigger.
00:22:39 Oh my gosh, that's what you're paying for?
00:22:41 Wow.
00:22:42 Yeah, I shouldn't have known that.
00:22:44 That has to tell you how to use tags.
00:22:46 Those really condescending copy and pasted messages
00:22:48 is like, hey, you know how,
00:22:50 how about we do half of it for you
00:22:52 and just give us all your money?
00:22:54 Now, I also do the whole thing.
00:22:56 Jeff's sold out hard enough to carry all of us.
00:22:58 That's true.
00:22:59 I've also done the thing with tags.
00:23:01 And what I've found...
00:23:02 Yeah, just one pro tip related to tags
00:23:05 that a lot of people don't think of,
00:23:07 put the name of your channel in every single...
00:23:09 Yeah, I was about to say,
00:23:11 I tag every single video I ever publish.
00:23:14 I tag DigiBro.
00:23:15 Isn't that like an inherent thing?
00:23:17 It's the name of the goddamn channel.
00:23:19 Tags control what shows up in your sidebar.
00:23:21 And so if you tag everything with your name,
00:23:24 then if someone gets into your channel,
00:23:26 then suddenly they're locked into your channel.
00:23:28 That's what I want to talk about.
00:23:29 I want to talk about sidebars,
00:23:30 because I've found that that's how I've gotten...
00:23:32 In the time that I've been doing like,
00:23:34 YouTube full time,
00:23:35 only two of my videos have taken off.
00:23:37 One about Roller Coaster Tycoon
00:23:39 and one about Undertale.
00:23:40 So this is the other way to sell out,
00:23:42 is to get in on the big trends,
00:23:44 the big fandoms.
00:23:45 I mean, almost everyone,
00:23:46 all but two people in this chat right now
00:23:48 first started doing YouTube making money
00:23:51 through another big franchise.
00:23:54 And is it banned?
00:23:56 We're not allowed to talk about it anymore.
00:23:58 Anyway, so...
00:24:00 None of my videos were ever really able to...
00:24:02 You did it, Davoo! You just did it!
00:24:04 I know, I was conscious of it at that time.
00:24:06 I was conscious of how I transitioned
00:24:08 from one sentence to another sentence
00:24:10 by going...
00:24:12 So I found...
00:24:13 Everybody post about how cute that is
00:24:14 when Davoo does that.
00:24:15 Everybody complimented him.
00:24:17 I was never able to find...
00:24:18 I was never able to get much success
00:24:20 through getting searched
00:24:21 because I don't know,
00:24:22 nothing that I ever posted
00:24:23 was something that people search much about.
00:24:25 Normally people seem to watch videos
00:24:27 by clicking on one
00:24:28 and then going on the sidebar
00:24:30 and they basically go sidebar surfing.
00:24:32 So people are going to sit down all day
00:24:34 watching Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 videos
00:24:36 if that's what they're doing, right?
00:24:38 Now, that's why so many people
00:24:40 didn't like that video
00:24:41 because they're in the mindset
00:24:42 of liking Roller Coaster Tycoon 3.
00:24:45 Whereas I'm posting the video
00:24:47 in the mindset of being a video game
00:24:49 commentator, right?
00:24:51 I'm going in and the reason
00:24:53 that my Undertale video took off
00:24:55 so much is because it's a really weird
00:24:57 statement in the title
00:24:59 that really throws people off.
00:25:01 And it's...
00:25:02 Yeah, Davoo, I wanted to say
00:25:04 it's interesting to me, very much so,
00:25:06 to compare our two different Undertale videos
00:25:09 because mine is a fucking 10 out of 10
00:25:11 masterpiece of artistic wonder.
00:25:13 And Davoo's on the other hand...
00:25:15 No, it's not even that.
00:25:17 Davoo's was A, much more timely.
00:25:20 B, what had an interesting title to it.
00:25:23 And C, I don't know, maybe had a nicer
00:25:25 thumbnail, which definitely is simpler.
00:25:27 It had a hand-drawn thumbnail
00:25:29 that Davoo created, so it was art in one scene before.
00:25:31 Oh, you made that, dude?
00:25:32 Oh, I didn't know that.
00:25:33 If I made my Undertale videos
00:25:36 title anything but
00:25:38 Mother's Basement Review Undertale,
00:25:40 it probably would have gotten a million hits.
00:25:42 Now, don't forget one thing, though, guys.
00:25:44 If I'd made that video today,
00:25:46 if Undertale had came out today
00:25:48 and I'd done that video, it would have been much longer
00:25:50 because I would have done a much more expanded version
00:25:52 of the script that would have resonated
00:25:54 with more people.
00:25:56 Nobody cares, Davoo.
00:25:58 Well, I'm talking about, like, reaching people.
00:26:00 We're talking about selling out.
00:26:02 I want to ask Jeff, because you were talking about before.
00:26:04 Yeah.
00:26:05 All right, it's just,
00:26:07 the way that you title your videos,
00:26:09 what's in an OP?
00:26:10 I see that you always consciously have chose
00:26:12 to brand yourself, you know, with, like, the name of the thing,
00:26:14 as opposed to someone like Digi, who doesn't do that ever.
00:26:17 And I'm just wondering, you know,
00:26:19 what's the reason for that choice?
00:26:21 You guys, I'm sure you have reasons for that.
00:26:23 You know, I think with Jeff,
00:26:25 he's got one of the few ways that it can work,
00:26:27 because I think that old YouTube,
00:26:29 like, the mentality people had about it
00:26:31 was very much that people were coming for you.
00:26:34 Like, there was individual content creators.
00:26:36 They were looking for your series, your story.
00:26:38 Yeah, YouTube pages used to be, like, MySpace pages and stuff.
00:26:41 Yeah.
00:26:42 And so, and, you know, people like that guy with the glasses
00:26:45 who have very well-defined series,
00:26:47 and those are, like, what people do before you.
00:26:49 Angry Video Game Nerd, his name is in the titles.
00:26:51 Those guys are institutions, though, so, yeah.
00:26:53 But now, like, 80% of all the views I get,
00:26:56 if not more, is from, like,
00:26:58 is from people being on YouTube browsing.
00:27:01 So it's almost all sidebar hits, recommended videos,
00:27:04 you know, people on their home page,
00:27:06 and it recommends them because they've clicked on anime videos,
00:27:09 so we suggest DigiBro videos.
00:27:11 And so, I tailor everything to be for those people,
00:27:15 because anyone who is already subscribed to me,
00:27:17 it doesn't matter.
00:27:18 They're gonna watch my videos no matter what.
00:27:20 So tailoring it for them is completely unnecessary.
00:27:22 I'm tailoring it all for the people who aren't subscribed,
00:27:25 who don't know who I am.
00:27:26 And if it says, like, DigiBro review,
00:27:29 none of them know who I am.
00:27:31 They don't give a fuck who DigiBro is.
00:27:33 They don't care about his review.
00:27:34 What they want to know is, you know,
00:27:36 why Konosuba is genuinely hilarious.
00:27:39 And they're like, I like Konosuba,
00:27:41 and there's a big picture of the most popular character
00:27:43 from the show, who I don't even really talk about in the video,
00:27:46 but she's giving a thumbs up on the thumbnail.
00:27:49 It's adorable.
00:27:50 It's a memorable moment from the show,
00:27:52 and it's the most popular character.
00:27:54 So that video gets 250,000 hits,
00:27:57 which is what it has before it got...
00:27:59 It would have way more than that if it hadn't gotten taken down
00:28:01 for, like, three fucking weeks by Katakawa.
00:28:03 But...
00:28:04 Those fuckers.
00:28:05 So for me, it's all about, like,
00:28:07 what's the catchiest possible title,
00:28:10 no connection to anything, flashiest thumbnail,
00:28:12 what's going to get people's attention,
00:28:14 but without stepping into the boundary of looking trashy,
00:28:17 you know, where it's, like, ten hottest tits in Konosuba, you know.
00:28:21 Well, excuse me.
00:28:23 Looking trashy is the best way to get hits.
00:28:26 No, it is.
00:28:27 I just objectively proved with ass in the thumbnail.
00:28:31 I mean, don't get me wrong.
00:28:32 Well, not an irrelevant ass in the thumbnail.
00:28:34 Yeah.
00:28:35 No, I have a lot of tits in thumbnails and stuff
00:28:37 with the Astroscore series,
00:28:38 but that's because they're also semi-ironic,
00:28:41 because, like, having tits in the thumbnail
00:28:43 fits in with the narrative of the videos
00:28:45 that I'm criticizing shows from tits.
00:28:46 All right, but let me, I mean, if you, like,
00:28:48 just, does any average viewer,
00:28:50 the people that you're marketing the videos to,
00:28:52 do they get that it's ironic?
00:28:53 No, no, no.
00:28:54 I'm not attracting them on that basis.
00:28:55 You see, that's an excuse that you're using,
00:28:57 and I agree with you, it's fine.
00:28:58 I'm not making it as an excuse.
00:28:59 I'm saying why it doesn't damage my brand.
00:29:02 Because if I...
00:29:03 What it doesn't damage is your view of yourself.
00:29:05 Nobody else cares.
00:29:06 Nobody else is thinking about it.
00:29:07 No, no, people do care.
00:29:08 People want to subscribe to people who look smart.
00:29:09 You think so?
00:29:10 Nobody wants to subscribe.
00:29:11 Yeah, I guess.
00:29:12 Like, the biggest criticism, like,
00:29:13 I think most people who hate Misty Kronexia
00:29:14 haven't watched any of his videos.
00:29:16 They've looked at his thumbnails and his subject matter,
00:29:19 and they click on a video and they see his posters,
00:29:21 and they think, this guy is a fucking sleaze, right?
00:29:23 Like, his videos will be, like,
00:29:25 top 10 most fappable lollies,
00:29:27 and it'll be a picture of an ass on the cover.
00:29:29 And then you click on it,
00:29:30 and it's him in front of all these trashy,
00:29:32 sordid online posters talking about how much
00:29:34 he likes lolly ass, you know?
00:29:36 Like, people subscribe to me because they think
00:29:38 I'm intellectual.
00:29:39 They think I'm smart.
00:29:40 They want to be taught something, you know?
00:29:42 You've tricked me out of success.
00:29:43 That's true, that's right.
00:29:44 Yeah, if I put tits on the thumbnail,
00:29:46 and then you click on the video,
00:29:48 and it gives you the impression that it's a clever
00:29:50 subversion of it, then it still feels smart,
00:29:53 and it doesn't hurt my brand.
00:29:54 But if I was talking about a show,
00:29:56 like, you know, some show that is deeply
00:30:00 well-respected or something,
00:30:02 and I just put tits up there,
00:30:04 and then my video has nothing to do with tits,
00:30:06 and it's all heady and deep,
00:30:07 it would be really obvious that it was like
00:30:09 a clickbait thing, you know?
00:30:11 I just don't even know people are thinking about it that much.
00:30:13 I just don't even know people are thinking about it that much.
00:30:15 Well, it's deeply beloved.
00:30:17 But anyways, the reason that it works for Jeff, I think,
00:30:19 is that what's in an OP is a good title
00:30:23 every single time.
00:30:24 Yeah.
00:30:25 Because it's not a series title, really.
00:30:27 Like, if you see...
00:30:28 It doesn't work for me,
00:30:29 because I don't know what an OP is.
00:30:31 I mean, I kind of know.
00:30:32 It's an opening video.
00:30:33 If you watched one video, you'd know.
00:30:35 Any other anime fan would know that.
00:30:37 Yeah, I guess.
00:30:38 I mean, okay, I did know that that's what it was,
00:30:41 but when I see OP, I don't think that.
00:30:43 I think one piece.
00:30:44 I think all of Jeff's videos are about one piece.
00:30:47 Are you telling me they're not?
00:30:48 Ben, your total plan.
00:30:49 That unsubscribe.
00:30:50 That's double the reason to subscribe.
00:30:53 I thought he was a one-piece analyst this whole time.
00:30:56 God damn it.
00:30:57 What's been happening?
00:30:58 When I saw what's in an OP, Your Lion, April,
00:31:00 on the front page of Reddit,
00:31:01 I didn't think, oh, this is a series.
00:31:03 I thought this is going to be an analysis
00:31:05 of the OP of Your Lion, April.
00:31:08 And then every single time I see it,
00:31:09 it's like, oh, that's going to be an analysis
00:31:11 of the OP of Bakano.
00:31:12 Wait a minute.
00:31:13 Was that a super clever April Fools title?
00:31:15 Because it's Your Lion, April.
00:31:16 Was it not even about that show?
00:31:17 No.
00:31:18 Well, it was.
00:31:19 Damn it.
00:31:20 That would have been so awesome.
00:31:21 That would be fun.
00:31:25 The April Fools video was Corey in the house.
00:31:27 For April Fools next year, I should just,
00:31:29 I should make it, what's in an OP?
00:31:32 Your Lion, April, second OP.
00:31:34 And then just make it about fucking, I don't know.
00:31:37 Dick, something else.
00:31:38 Yeah.
00:31:39 Something else.
00:31:40 Anything else.
00:31:41 The Bocano-Pico opening.
00:31:42 I feel like we're off top.
00:31:43 I don't think what we're talking about is selling out.
00:31:45 We're talking about SEO optimization.
00:31:47 This is turned into a, like, a guide to selling out.
00:31:51 I want to get to, all I care about is me.
00:31:53 So do you, what about my system?
00:31:55 I definitely have the old school,
00:31:56 John Tron style of things where it's just my name
00:31:58 and branding.
00:31:59 You're telling me that it's a better idea to find
00:32:01 some sort of generic way of appearing individually.
00:32:03 Well, I think yours works too.
00:32:04 The reason I never, like, told you to stop,
00:32:06 because I think best anime ever grew on the gun,
00:32:09 like every single time, again, like what's in an OP,
00:32:12 it's always a title for that video.
00:32:14 It's never just, here's the name of my series,
00:32:16 and then also a video title.
00:32:18 Well, except that a lot of people,
00:32:20 a lot of people got really fucking angry at him
00:32:23 for saying the best game ever.
00:32:25 Best game ever Undertale.
00:32:26 Yeah, because they heard that from the whole internet.
00:32:29 Okay, that's a unique case in that one,
00:32:31 but I wonder if, I don't care if they get mad
00:32:34 as long as they come in and watch,
00:32:36 they can get as mad as they want.
00:32:37 That was what happened on our anime
00:32:39 is best anime ever, One Punch Man, got no attention.
00:32:42 It was like a severely downvote.
00:32:44 Everyone hated that, yeah.
00:32:45 Just because of the title.
00:32:47 No one watched the fucking video.
00:32:49 It was just they said,
00:32:50 One Punch Man's not the best anime ever, downvote.
00:32:53 It only works if it's either one
00:32:55 that people really feel is the best anime ever,
00:32:57 or one that people obviously know isn't
00:32:59 and they've realized it's a joke.
00:33:01 That's why I need to appeal to lesser known things
00:33:03 with that sort of stuff.
00:33:04 It only works once people know who you are.
00:33:07 Wait a second, Nate.
00:33:08 Wait a second, Nate.
00:33:09 I just realized the whole subversion
00:33:10 is that no one cares about One Punch Man
00:33:12 because it's the best ever.
00:33:13 It called the best ever the same way
00:33:15 that Saitama himself is the most strong man in knowing.
00:33:18 I thought there was some sort of meta going on here,
00:33:21 but not really.
00:33:22 I'll find it later.
00:33:24 What were you saying?
00:33:26 Wait, hang on.
00:33:27 I was saying the difference between
00:33:29 Jeffson Nate's thing is that
00:33:30 Nate is making a statement with his
00:33:32 if you put like a question mark
00:33:33 at the end of Best Anime Ever,
00:33:35 that might rectify the whole thing.
00:33:37 No, that would totally change everything.
00:33:39 No, I can't do that.
00:33:40 That's fucking gay as shit.
00:33:42 Best anime ever?
00:33:44 No, I can't do it.
00:33:45 I'll let him do it next time.
00:33:46 Nate, next time you got to do that.
00:33:47 I wouldn't work with it.
00:33:48 I'll kill that for the ever.
00:33:49 Oh my god, it would work.
00:33:51 Maybe I could squeeze a tilled.
00:33:53 I can't do a question mark.
00:33:54 I can't live with myself.
00:33:55 I don't know what the tilled is going to do.
00:33:57 I don't know what to do anything.
00:33:59 I think it worked out really well with the first two
00:34:02 because Gurren Lagann,
00:34:03 a lot of people legitimately feel that way.
00:34:05 And then Monster Musume, like you said,
00:34:07 it was so obviously not the best anime ever
00:34:09 that people got that it was a joke.
00:34:11 But with One Punch Man,
00:34:12 it's too relevant and too contested
00:34:15 where people really are out there on the internet
00:34:17 arguing about whether it's the best anime ever.
00:34:19 And it's the same deal with Undertale.
00:34:22 It's like, even though that is the best game ever,
00:34:26 some people don't think so.
00:34:29 Some people think Uncharted is the best game ever
00:34:32 and are wrong.
00:34:33 I was thinking about doing a separate section
00:34:36 for modern things.
00:34:37 Maybe I'll give that some more thought.
00:34:39 But anyway, we're off topic.
00:34:41 We're talking about my shit.
00:34:42 I'm trying to think about
00:34:43 whether I need a good name for mine.
00:34:46 Because all I do is,
00:34:47 for my ones, I just say the name of the game first
00:34:50 and then hit the critical review afterwards.
00:34:53 Yeah, I mean, you're definitely...
00:34:55 It's okay.
00:34:56 I mean, you do very John Trani videos like I do,
00:34:58 which is just like, we take the thing
00:35:00 and then we just say whatever we want about it.
00:35:02 And it's not like exploring a specific theme.
00:35:04 John Trani's very old YouTube, though, man.
00:35:05 I know.
00:35:06 And then to his formula, totally, like,
00:35:08 no one should try to take the John Tron path.
00:35:10 Nobody should do it.
00:35:11 It's not viable.
00:35:12 The John Tron path is get lucky,
00:35:14 get successful on Reddit one time.
00:35:16 Yeah, that's right.
00:35:17 Not to say that it's not good,
00:35:18 but he definitely was one of the very few
00:35:21 to succeed in that way.
00:35:22 And I think it all really comes down
00:35:25 to him singing firework at the end of that video.
00:35:28 That's the entire reason that John Tron
00:35:31 is as big as he is now.
00:35:33 It was his hard-hitting analysis of DiCatana
00:35:35 that really propelled him into fame.
00:35:37 It was his Yonkers, man.
00:35:38 I don't know if you guys know about the...
00:35:40 It was Dino City?
00:35:41 No.
00:35:42 Bro, like, that's the one.
00:35:43 Yeah, it was Dino City.
00:35:44 No, that's what I'm saying.
00:35:45 I was saying it was his Yonkers.
00:35:46 Yonkers is a song by Tyler the Creator
00:35:49 where he had a music video where he, like,
00:35:51 ate a live cockroach in the video
00:35:53 and it got, like, super viral.
00:35:54 Yeah.
00:35:55 And that's why he's famous now.
00:35:56 Oh, I gotcha.
00:35:57 So it's just like one random little thing he did,
00:35:59 like, completely sparked his whole career.
00:36:01 Well, I'll just say, I've got a video cooking right now.
00:36:04 I've got some big plans for it.
00:36:05 I think it might be the one.
00:36:06 We'll see in, like, six, seven, eight months.
00:36:08 Let's talk...
00:36:09 Let's shift gears for a minute.
00:36:10 Yeah.
00:36:11 Let's not talk about how we can sell out.
00:36:13 Let's talk about other people who sell out.
00:36:15 Hmm.
00:36:16 I just...
00:36:17 Before we move from us to other people,
00:36:19 I just want to say...
00:36:20 Yeah.
00:36:21 The only time that I've ever been accused of selling out
00:36:24 was when I started putting annotations
00:36:28 at the end of my videos,
00:36:29 linking to other videos that are mine.
00:36:32 And then again when you joined this call.
00:36:35 And then again when I joined this call, obviously.
00:36:37 Yeah.
00:36:38 It was like a Vietnam flashback at starting this call.
00:36:41 But, you know, I mean, that's a totally bullshit criticism.
00:36:44 There's nothing wrong with linking to more of your videos.
00:36:46 You have to assume people want to watch your content
00:36:48 if they're watching your content,
00:36:50 so you might as well make it easy for them.
00:36:51 So, fuck them.
00:36:52 Backwinks are really important.
00:36:54 That's another thing that you learn from text journalism
00:36:56 and common sense.
00:36:58 So, you know, a thing about other people who are, you know,
00:37:00 big YouTubers who do things that are pretty shallow to get hits,
00:37:03 I think the reason that a lot of people don't like them
00:37:06 is that they don't respect their work ethic.
00:37:08 Because I...
00:37:09 Whenever my friend comes over
00:37:11 and puts on a normal boots or a hidden block video,
00:37:13 I'm like,
00:37:14 man, why do these guys get out of video every two or three weeks?
00:37:17 And I told her one time, like,
00:37:18 dude, if I were doing videos like this,
00:37:20 I would have a video out every other day.
00:37:22 You know, like, at some point...
00:37:24 Alright, you know what?
00:37:25 You've got me devout.
00:37:26 You've got me by the hooks.
00:37:27 I've got to give this rant.
00:37:28 This rant has been brewing inside me for a while.
00:37:30 Okay, let's hear it.
00:37:31 Alright.
00:37:32 It's called Fuck Movie Bob.
00:37:33 I've titled this one.
00:37:34 Alright.
00:37:35 That's a good one.
00:37:36 So,
00:37:37 Fuckin' Movie Bob, right?
00:37:38 This fucker.
00:37:39 Right.
00:37:40 This dude,
00:37:41 he's been around for a long time, right?
00:37:43 He used to do the Game Over thinker series,
00:37:46 originally on Screw Attack.
00:37:47 Originally on YouTube, and he got on Screw Attack, yeah.
00:37:49 Which was terrible.
00:37:50 Yeah, it's terrible,
00:37:51 and it went on forever.
00:37:53 I had this weird, stupid narrative.
00:37:55 It was bad.
00:37:56 But, he also made movie reviews and analysis on The Escapist, right?
00:38:01 And it would be two videos a week.
00:38:04 He had his Escape to the Movies reviews,
00:38:06 which were just pretty much standard movie reviews,
00:38:08 and his The Big Picture videos,
00:38:11 which were like these interesting looks into the history of film,
00:38:14 talking about specific stuff,
00:38:16 and they're really cool,
00:38:17 because he has a lot of knowledge,
00:38:18 and so it was like learning cool, interesting facts about film history, right?
00:38:22 Two videos a week.
00:38:24 So, he gets fired from The Escapist,
00:38:26 alongside a bunch of other people, right?
00:38:28 Too fat.
00:38:29 And, yeah.
00:38:31 Couldn't fit in the damn door.
00:38:33 So, he goes to YouTube,
00:38:34 and he starts doing two different series.
00:38:36 He's got one called Really That Good,
00:38:38 and one that's just his normal reviews.
00:38:40 Yeah.
00:38:41 His normal reviews are the most, like,
00:38:44 click-baity, possible things in the universe.
00:38:47 It'll be, he'll cover a new movie,
00:38:49 the instant it comes out,
00:38:51 and he'll just, like, if it's bad at all,
00:38:54 he'll make it out like it's the worst movie of all time,
00:38:57 rag on it incessantly, obnoxiously.
00:38:59 Yeah, yeah.
00:39:00 Oh, my God.
00:39:01 Which is pretty cathartic,
00:39:03 if you're, like, wanting...
00:39:05 Well, that's the problem.
00:39:07 If you want pixels to fail,
00:39:10 then that review is...
00:39:12 But back when he was doing regular reviews,
00:39:14 every week, talking about a new review,
00:39:16 a new video, a new movie,
00:39:18 every year, there would usually be one movie
00:39:21 that came out where he was like,
00:39:22 this movie's so bad, it's a big piece of shit
00:39:24 with a cunt and a face and a fucker,
00:39:26 and I hate it, and it's dead,
00:39:27 and it's a big pile of duty shit pits,
00:39:29 and that's, like, the whole video.
00:39:31 And now he's doing it all the time.
00:39:32 And now it's every single review he does
00:39:34 is written like that.
00:39:36 Right.
00:39:37 It'll be, like, because he did pixels,
00:39:39 and it was just like,
00:39:40 this is the shittiest cock bullshit.
00:39:42 It's written, like, old AVGM from 2005.
00:39:45 Old AVGM ripoffs.
00:39:46 Very important distinction.
00:39:47 Right.
00:39:48 Like, the people who were just,
00:39:49 who just slammed a bunch of swear words together
00:39:51 and they think that makes sense.
00:39:52 And I think he would put whatever...
00:39:53 And I think he was even more inelegant
00:39:54 than any of the ripoffs.
00:39:55 It's, like, just stop interrupting my damn rant.
00:39:56 I just want to get past this.
00:39:57 I, he's, this...
00:39:59 These reviews are shitty.
00:40:01 These worse than Chris Bors is that one.
00:40:03 I don't know who Chris fucking Bors is.
00:40:05 I don't care.
00:40:06 Let me finish my rant.
00:40:07 I have to keep going.
00:40:08 I have to keep my blood pressure high enough.
00:40:10 God damn it.
00:40:11 So he makes these shitty fucking reviews.
00:40:13 He's got these, this pixels review.
00:40:14 He's got his one for Fantastic Four.
00:40:16 He's got the one for the fucking, the visit.
00:40:18 Is that what the M. Night Shyamalan one was?
00:40:20 They're all the same review.
00:40:21 Copy paste.
00:40:22 He just gets mad at a movie.
00:40:24 Oh, so clever.
00:40:25 So, like, oh, we all get to hate this movie
00:40:28 because it killed our family.
00:40:30 He actually said at one point in the pixels review
00:40:32 that it felt like Adam Sandler came into his house
00:40:35 and pissed on his old toys or something.
00:40:37 Like, what the fuck?
00:40:38 It's a movie you paid to see, you fucking idiot.
00:40:41 So he goes and he writes these reviews
00:40:42 and they're always, like, the week it comes out
00:40:44 and they get really, they get a ton of views, right?
00:40:46 But here's the thing.
00:40:47 He's, even though, even though it's so easy,
00:40:49 he's doing the easiest reviews possible, right?
00:40:51 All he does is he writes a bunch of swear words.
00:40:53 He comes home and he just loops trailer footage
00:40:56 for six minutes while he just rambles.
00:40:58 His audio is garbage.
00:41:00 He fucking records into, like, a headset.
00:41:02 He cuts himself off at the end of words constantly.
00:41:05 I don't understand how he does that.
00:41:07 Like, he takes a week to do something
00:41:10 that I can literally do in 45 minutes.
00:41:13 In 45 minutes when I come home from the movie.
00:41:16 Like, pounding the render.
00:41:18 Yeah, and he'll come, he'll do these movies.
00:41:20 Like, if I did reviews like he does,
00:41:23 I could get them out literally five times a day.
00:41:26 I could do that.
00:41:27 I could review, I could review,
00:41:29 it would take me longer to watch the movies
00:41:31 than it would do to make those reviews.
00:41:33 They're just basic barebones shit.
00:41:35 And yet, somehow, he only makes, like,
00:41:37 one or two a month of those standard reviews.
00:41:40 And then he's got the really that good series
00:41:42 and these only come out, like, quarterly, right?
00:41:44 And they're, like, 45 minutes long,
00:41:46 they're heavily edited, you know,
00:41:48 they're good analysis videos,
00:41:50 but they're rambling.
00:41:51 He repeats himself constantly.
00:41:53 They're all 20 minutes longer than they need to be.
00:41:55 All of them could be cut in half.
00:41:56 He needs an editor.
00:41:57 He needs a fucking editor bad.
00:41:59 His audio is shit, so it's always like,
00:42:01 when you're listening to it,
00:42:02 it slowly grains on you, right?
00:42:04 Like, it slowly becomes tiring because it's so long.
00:42:07 You have to understand, Digi,
00:42:10 that if his microphone was better,
00:42:12 it would just pick up the sound of all of his fat jiggling
00:42:15 as he talks.
00:42:16 Yeah.
00:42:17 As he tries to squeeze out syllable
00:42:19 between the rolls and his fucking throat.
00:42:21 Here's the thing.
00:42:22 If MovieBob was just a channel
00:42:24 that put out, like, one review every month
00:42:26 and one really that good every quarter
00:42:28 and they were exactly what they were,
00:42:30 it wouldn't be a problem, right?
00:42:31 If that was all it was, if it was just some guy,
00:42:33 some YouTube guy doing that, right?
00:42:35 But it's not.
00:42:36 It's MovieBob.
00:42:37 It's MovieBob who has a lot of Patreon money.
00:42:40 Yeah.
00:42:41 A lot of Patreon money.
00:42:42 He has financial incentives to do nothing.
00:42:44 All he does is get 3,000 a month,
00:42:46 regardless of what he does.
00:42:47 Right.
00:42:48 He doesn't even get, like, at minimum,
00:42:52 he should have one,
00:42:53 because he has a monthly cycle,
00:42:54 so he's not getting paid by video.
00:42:56 He's getting paid by month.
00:42:57 So there are months that pass by
00:42:59 where he'll put out one six-minute bullshit review
00:43:03 that you could make in 45 minutes.
00:43:05 And it's like, all month.
00:43:07 And get paid thousands of dollars.
00:43:09 He's living in a world of privilege.
00:43:11 I wonder what his creator goal is.
00:43:14 I haven't even gotten to the biggest thing of all.
00:43:18 The big cherry on top of this shit Sunday, right?
00:43:21 So I'm already mad at him
00:43:22 that he doesn't get really that good out once a month
00:43:24 because he should be able to.
00:43:26 There's no reason he can't.
00:43:27 YMS puts more effort into his videos
00:43:29 and he can get out one a month almost always.
00:43:32 You know, I could easily get a really that good out
00:43:35 every fucking week if I had the material
00:43:37 and I wanted to do that, you know.
00:43:39 Well, you have DeVoo to do your...
00:43:41 I don't even need DeVoo.
00:43:43 I did 30 videos in a month
00:43:46 last August to October.
00:43:50 No one needs me to do movie Bob's level of editing.
00:43:53 Yes, true.
00:43:55 And here's the thing.
00:43:58 He put out this video.
00:43:59 This video made me so mad.
00:44:01 I almost shat a brick in my chair.
00:44:04 This dude puts out a video
00:44:07 where he literally says,
00:44:09 the next really that good is on the way.
00:44:12 It's a text video.
00:44:14 It's like, you know, epic music and text coming onto the screen.
00:44:16 It's like, but you know,
00:44:18 these, you know, I really have to fund these things.
00:44:21 So if you guys give me more on Patreon,
00:44:24 maybe it'll come out sooner.
00:44:26 Oh my God.
00:44:28 He really legitimately did that.
00:44:31 There's a whole video on his channel.
00:44:33 This nigga, right after that, he called up Domino's
00:44:35 because he's a pizza shit.
00:44:37 He made a whole video.
00:44:39 Like you said, he used to get out two videos a week.
00:44:41 I guess back when the escapist were constantly hounding him
00:44:44 to get off his ass and start doing things.
00:44:46 Everything I know about the escapist business
00:44:48 is that they're fairly cutthroat for internet standards.
00:44:51 But now he's just on Patreon.
00:44:53 What kind of work does he have?
00:44:54 What are even his creator goals?
00:44:55 $5,000 a month.
00:44:56 I'll finally put in a channel banner.
00:44:58 $7,000 a month.
00:45:00 I'll have a new avatar that is in a shitty selfie of my fat face.
00:45:03 Does he really say that?
00:45:05 Wait, is that for real though?
00:45:07 He doesn't have a channel banner.
00:45:09 $3,000.
00:45:10 No, but it doesn't actually say that on his Patreon.
00:45:12 No, but it should.
00:45:13 That's probably what he values.
00:45:15 He really had to be going for a second there.
00:45:17 You know, he probably got that.
00:45:19 This goes back to what I said before.
00:45:21 Davoo, I think it was, who said that, you know,
00:45:24 I hate people, things that make people money.
00:45:26 No, I only hate it when people make more money than they deserve.
00:45:29 And this is a case of a guy who I actually like movie Bob kind of.
00:45:32 I really like Really That Good.
00:45:34 I think it's a good series.
00:45:35 But I don't think he should be making $3,000 a month
00:45:38 to put out like four in a year.
00:45:40 It's outlandish.
00:45:41 It's fucking ridiculous, especially because like I said,
00:45:43 I like Really That Good too.
00:45:45 But again, I'm looking at it from the perspective of
00:45:48 I'm also a content creator.
00:45:50 And I can legitimately say I think I'm a better writer
00:45:53 than movie Bob in terms of like revisions.
00:45:55 Well, that's not hard.
00:45:57 I mean, I don't think he's bad.
00:45:59 It's just that he repeats himself too much.
00:46:01 Look, Digi, all we have to say is that you don't constantly
00:46:03 inject 9-11 into your writing, which actually,
00:46:06 that's actually the best thing I've ever done.
00:46:08 That doesn't bother me.
00:46:10 No, no, I think it's hilarious.
00:46:12 I love it.
00:46:13 Everyone should mention 9-11 for unrelated reasons.
00:46:15 He does it in his book.
00:46:17 He says, when I first saw Super Mario Brothers 3,
00:46:19 I thought it was the most impactful moment of my generation,
00:46:21 just like the shooting of JFK was for my parents,
00:46:23 and then 9-11 was for the next generation.
00:46:26 I thought it was amazing.
00:46:28 What the fuck?
00:46:29 I just can't believe that he has the gull to make a video
00:46:35 saying like, give me more money so I can finish this video
00:46:40 that's already a series I've already been doing.
00:46:43 And like, and what does he need more money for?
00:46:47 He's making $3,000 a month to do something.
00:46:51 Dude, I'll tell you exactly what it is.
00:46:53 He's living a life.
00:46:54 In his life, he needs some more money,
00:46:56 so he's saying, okay, they'll give me more money.
00:46:59 Bob, stop eating so much and you'll be able to fucking
00:47:01 afford your life!
00:47:03 He said fuck!
00:47:04 Even though like, this is why there are a lot of people
00:47:08 who are pretty click-baity or don't make a whole lot of
00:47:11 deep content, but we really respect like Anthony Fantano,
00:47:15 who proves those people exactly wrong by getting out of
00:47:18 video every day, right?
00:47:21 Yeah, and by the way guys, by the way,
00:47:23 I'd like to suggest that for our selling out purposes,
00:47:25 we should title this video The Movie Bob Rant.
00:47:28 The Movie Bob Rant, yeah.
00:47:30 I don't know if you don't want to start eating drama with
00:47:32 Movie Bob, but I imagine his fans would be terrible.
00:47:35 No, no.
00:47:36 But we do because that's the ultimate way to sell out drama.
00:47:38 Holy shit, let's talk about drama now.
00:47:40 Let's talk about that.
00:47:41 There is nothing more clickable.
00:47:43 Leafy is here.
00:47:44 Before we move on.
00:47:45 Yeah.
00:47:46 Go on, Ben, finish your fork.
00:47:47 Before we move on from Movie Bob, I just want to say that
00:47:49 I am about 75% certain that I saw him at the South Station
00:47:53 train station in Boston a couple weeks ago.
00:47:56 I mean, I was at like this station restaurant.
00:47:59 I saw him sitting there eating food at this train station
00:48:03 restaurant, but you know, I can't be sure because it could
00:48:06 have been any other big fat guy with a goatee.
00:48:09 I have food, big surprise there.
00:48:12 It didn't look exactly like him.
00:48:14 I am 100% sure.
00:48:15 And he is a Bostonian.
00:48:16 Yeah, right.
00:48:17 He is a Bostonian, so it's not entirely inconceivable.
00:48:19 But Ben, I am 100% sure that I saw Movie Bob on Google Earth
00:48:23 while I was browsing over the city of Boston.
00:48:27 What?
00:48:30 Were you zoomed out like eight times?
00:48:33 This was not street view.
00:48:35 He was just visible.
00:48:36 This was not street view.
00:48:37 No, I was looking at the topography of the entire
00:48:40 Massachusetts area.
00:48:43 I was like, oh, hey, Movie Bob.
00:48:45 By the way, if you're a viewer of this show and you're fatter
00:48:48 than Movie Bob, we love you, and it's not a problem.
00:48:51 It's only gross to be fat if you're also Movie Bob.
00:48:53 Yeah, that's right.
00:48:55 No, Movie Bob is gross because he's Movie Bob,
00:48:58 and the fat is part of that.
00:49:01 I don't know, Movie Bob's easy to make fun of,
00:49:03 but I don't really mind him that much, except that I think
00:49:05 he should make less money.
00:49:07 No, don't get me wrong.
00:49:08 I'm with you, Ben, because I've been a fan of Movie Bob
00:49:11 for like five years, and I've seen all of his videos.
00:49:14 I think I've watched every single big picture.
00:49:17 I've been a fan for like eight years now.
00:49:19 I've watched all of his videos when he was on The Escapist.
00:49:21 Oh my God, the funniest thing ever was when someone,
00:49:24 he was doing like a Q&A video on Game Overthinker,
00:49:27 and someone asked him, when will you stop putting
00:49:30 in these terrible skits and just talk about games
00:49:32 like a journalist, which is the only thing you're good at?
00:49:35 And he answered like, yeah, maybe when I decide
00:49:38 that I'm okay with putting out an inferior
00:49:41 on total lack of self-awareness.
00:49:43 Okay, you know, that's really interesting.
00:49:45 It's really interesting, because the way that people,
00:49:48 there's such a weird dualality.
00:49:51 Yeah, exactly, he doesn't understand,
00:49:53 but you know, a lot of people are like that,
00:49:55 that they do these things because they're,
00:49:57 you know what, I don't want to shit on him,
00:49:58 but Jesse is kind of this way,
00:50:00 and just that he's so dead set in making his videos
00:50:03 in a certain way, even when other people,
00:50:05 even if he's good at it.
00:50:07 He's good at it.
00:50:08 I mean, it's not that he's bad at it.
00:50:10 It's not that he's bad at it, but like,
00:50:11 you look at him like the bloody dead man.
00:50:13 Jesse's good at it.
00:50:14 And I agree with that some of the time,
00:50:16 maybe most of the time.
00:50:18 Where is Jesse, by the way?
00:50:20 I don't know, he's out.
00:50:21 He's fucking his secretary, probably.
00:50:22 Movie Bob Skits are the greatest argument
00:50:25 against him as a film critic, period.
00:50:28 Yeah.
00:50:29 The fact that he can make that and think,
00:50:31 yeah, that's a good argument.
00:50:32 It's also the greatest argument against
00:50:34 personal artistic integrity.
00:50:36 Yeah, that's true.
00:50:37 Yeah.
00:50:38 That's true.
00:50:39 Some people need to sell out more.
00:50:41 Some people need to sell out more to improve their art.
00:50:43 All right, yeah.
00:50:44 Let me get into that.
00:50:45 I want to, rather than drama,
00:50:46 because I don't even want to talk about that.
00:50:47 That could be its own podcast.
00:50:48 Yeah, fuck it.
00:50:49 We all get it.
00:50:50 We all do.
00:50:51 Like, so for me personally, like,
00:50:54 I grew up with lots of like weird ideas I wanted to do.
00:50:58 Like, most of the stuff,
00:50:59 a lot of the reason I never decided to work for a magazine
00:51:02 is that to me, being able to do what I wanted to
00:51:05 was the most important thing.
00:51:07 And I didn't want to have any rules or limitations
00:51:09 on what kind of stuff I was allowed to write or publish.
00:51:12 So I would look at all these, you know, online magazines,
00:51:15 and they all have like a very specific style,
00:51:17 a very specific formula.
00:51:18 I mean, Jeff, you had the nightmare experience
00:51:21 of you had to change your scores
00:51:23 to reflect what the site wanted you to give the score.
00:51:26 Oh, man.
00:51:27 Holy shit.
00:51:28 Let me tell you a thing or two about Steve Hanley,
00:51:31 that piece of fucking garbage.
00:51:33 Yeah, I'm saying by name.
00:51:35 That dude.
00:51:36 That dude.
00:51:37 Could we get his home address?
00:51:39 His home address and phone number in the description.
00:51:42 Who is this we're talking about?
00:51:43 This is the editor-in-chief of Hardcore Gamer,
00:51:47 who, you know, I'm far enough out from that
00:51:50 that I have no worries about him attempting
00:51:53 to tank my career at this point.
00:51:55 At this point, I get...
00:51:57 I get more views on an individual video
00:52:00 than the entire site gets for a month.
00:52:02 So...
00:52:06 The best revenge is living well, as they say.
00:52:08 Yeah, and I mean, like...
00:52:10 Oh, God, there's so much wrong with that fucking website.
00:52:14 And it's not even a question of selling out,
00:52:16 because he didn't...
00:52:17 He had this weird sense of integrity
00:52:19 where he didn't understand what it meant.
00:52:21 Like, he wanted our reviews.
00:52:23 He wanted our review system to stay pure,
00:52:26 and by pure, I mean, ripping off IGN and Destructoid
00:52:28 and everything else on the internet.
00:52:30 Yeah, yeah.
00:52:31 So, I tried to make interesting reviews
00:52:35 that people would click on.
00:52:37 Like, when I reviewed one of the shittiest games on the planet,
00:52:39 Magus, I...
00:52:41 This is obviously ripping off something Jim Sterling did a long time ago
00:52:44 with Deadly Premonition,
00:52:46 where he gave that game a 5 out of 5 on Destructoid.
00:52:50 But I wanted to give Magus a 5 out of 5,
00:52:52 because that was a 5 out of 5 experience for me,
00:52:54 where I turned into a little leprechaun using a magic spell
00:52:57 and ran around like fucking Benny Hill,
00:52:59 circle strafing the final boss until he died.
00:53:02 That was fun times for me.
00:53:05 And he's like, no, we gotta give it a 1 out of 10,
00:53:08 because that's more true to what reviews are.
00:53:11 And it's like, okay...
00:53:13 Oh, yeah, let's just define our reviews
00:53:15 by what all the reviews say about the game,
00:53:17 instead of objectively abusing our own personal...
00:53:20 There was a moment...
00:53:21 What the fuck?
00:53:22 There was a moment I reviewed Stixmaster of Shadows,
00:53:24 which is the best stealth game to come out
00:53:26 in the last generation, period,
00:53:28 because all other stealth games are fucking garbage,
00:53:30 except for New Hitman.
00:53:31 Even Splinter Cell?
00:53:32 Yeah, even Splinter...
00:53:33 Especially Splinter Cell.
00:53:34 Splinter Cell is responsible for stealth games.
00:53:38 Don't get into a stealth rant.
00:53:40 What happened with it?
00:53:41 So I did a review of Stixmaster of Shadows.
00:53:45 He said I could put it on the front page.
00:53:47 I was the features editor at the time,
00:53:49 so I had the privilege to click...
00:53:52 Add this to the front page on my back-end thing.
00:53:55 I did that.
00:53:56 He took it off because the score was too high,
00:54:00 and he didn't want to make the site look bad.
00:54:03 And he said we could only put it back on.
00:54:05 I shit you not.
00:54:06 He said we could only put it back on
00:54:08 if another website gave the game a 4.5 out of 5.
00:54:11 Brilliant.
00:54:12 So just make your own website called Left Jew,
00:54:14 and then make a review.
00:54:17 He didn't understand remarkability at all as a concept.
00:54:23 You have to do something different from other people
00:54:27 in order to get people to click on your shit.
00:54:29 Because everybody writes game reviews.
00:54:31 Working for this guy didn't seem like it was a great time, was it?
00:54:35 And now you're reaching more people independently.
00:54:38 That's an interesting thing about selling out.
00:54:40 This is a very recent update in the world of selling out.
00:54:44 Normally it's like you get a dang publisher,
00:54:48 or label, or a manager, or an agent.
00:54:51 That's your key to sell out because back then
00:54:53 everything was made out of $1,000 analog equipment
00:54:56 that you needed to rent out in order to even use it.
00:54:59 And you didn't have the internet.
00:55:00 Today, working with other people
00:55:02 unless they're the exact right kind of people,
00:55:05 like all of us here, we're like so synergetic.
00:55:08 We're all really great people.
00:55:10 Synergistic.
00:55:11 We can work together and result in better and more product,
00:55:14 like this podcast you're listening to right now.
00:55:17 But by default, the idea of getting a manager
00:55:19 or a dude to do some things behind the scenes isn't necessary.
00:55:23 It increases the overhead.
00:55:24 It makes profits less likely, bogs things down,
00:55:27 makes things less interesting.
00:55:29 And I actually, just a couple like a month ago,
00:55:31 got an offer from a guy who runs a game publisher.
00:55:37 And they've developed some games themselves.
00:55:39 And he was like, hey, man, I like your videos.
00:55:41 So you're looking for a job.
00:55:42 And he wanted to offer me the position
00:55:44 to be a video game consultant of design.
00:55:49 Like basically just do game analysis,
00:55:51 but just tell them as it's being developed.
00:55:53 Wow, I didn't know a job like that existed.
00:55:55 And he also wanted to offer me...
00:55:57 That's a very profitable job, actually.
00:55:59 I have friends who do that.
00:56:01 Wow, I didn't even know it was a job until he told me.
00:56:04 And he also offered me to be like a podcast host
00:56:07 and also do game analysis for like their YouTube channel and stuff.
00:56:12 I'm like, you know, and if it weren't for the fact
00:56:14 that I was already doing the Digi Bro thing,
00:56:16 I may have more seriously considered it.
00:56:18 But then when I finally was able to put to finagle the conversation
00:56:21 into him into asking him how much he was going to pay me,
00:56:24 he asked me how much money I'm already getting paid.
00:56:27 I should have lied and said three times more than it is,
00:56:30 but I, you know, unfortunately told the truth.
00:56:32 Worst thing you want to do if you want to get big and sell out, by the way.
00:56:35 Never tell the truth, but more anyway.
00:56:37 So he's offered to basically pay me what I'm already getting paid,
00:56:41 but what I'm already getting paid is going up.
00:56:43 And so it's like Digi Bro's Patreon, which is indirectly paying me,
00:56:48 is going up at like a higher rate than this company is getting big.
00:56:52 And he even told me, this guy wasn't even like a great salesman.
00:56:55 Like I was doing a better job managing my PR than he was.
00:56:59 He was saying, yeah, we here at our company are pretty financially...
00:57:04 are pretty strapped for cash financially.
00:57:07 So not only are they strapped for cash, but financially so.
00:57:11 And it's like that was what really made it sink in.
00:57:13 Game development, especially indie game development,
00:57:16 is a giant death pit of money full of aides.
00:57:20 Like it's just not a good idea.
00:57:22 It's an over medium that's on the way out in terms of profitability
00:57:25 because everyone knows how to develop a game now.
00:57:28 You can't shake a stick without hitting an expert game designer
00:57:31 or a game developer.
00:57:33 Whereas YouTubers who really, really know what they're doing
00:57:36 are pretty rare for now.
00:57:38 And working all alone is actually a better system
00:57:42 because all your managers, your bosses, your agents, that's YouTube.
00:57:46 The YouTube algorithms are your managers.
00:57:49 And you have to work with them.
00:57:51 That's one thing.
00:57:52 Don't sell out by working with people unless they're the exact right kind of people.
00:57:56 This is the hardest thing, I think, for older people to understand
00:58:01 and why it's so hard for everyone who does this to explain to your dad
00:58:05 what you're trying to do.
00:58:07 We've had so many conversations with our dad trying to explain...
00:58:10 Nate, you need to go out and network with people.
00:58:13 He's always telling me to go to nearby colleges and find art students to connect with them.
00:58:19 I don't understand it.
00:58:21 I'm always asking them, why do you think that would help me?
00:58:24 It's because that's what he did to be successful when he was a kid.
00:58:27 And it's totally understandable, but...
00:58:29 I went out to buy a shirt with my mom and she was talking to the shirt guy
00:58:33 and she's like, hey, he does YouTube.
00:58:35 He could sell your shirts like a local shirt store.
00:58:38 Like they don't understand.
00:58:40 Yeah, it's totally different.
00:58:42 That happened to me at one time.
00:58:44 Well, parents will never get it.
00:58:46 My parents were at a GNC and the guy behind the counter,
00:58:50 he was a YouTuber who was trying to become a YouTuber.
00:58:53 The guy was working there.
00:58:55 And they were like, oh yeah, our son is a successful YouTuber.
00:58:58 They basically gave me his card because he had a card and everything.
00:59:03 This dude is not successful at all.
00:59:05 He's like a couple hundred subs, maybe like a thousand.
00:59:08 He's trying to do parkour and variety videos.
00:59:11 Oh yeah, you showed me this guy.
00:59:13 All of his content was just kind of weird and not really stuff that would get big on YouTube.
00:59:18 And this guy was in that mindset of like, I need to network.
00:59:22 I need to know people. I need to get my name out there.
00:59:24 He had the business cards.
00:59:26 He was trying to contact me.
00:59:28 He's taking the Mad Haas zone parkour pickup game.
00:59:30 He was trying to contact me because I'm popular and he was trying to find a way to network with me.
00:59:36 And I'm like, dude, I talked to him and I was like,
00:59:39 I think the problem with your content is that it's confusing.
00:59:42 People come here and they don't know what it is.
00:59:44 You haven't made anything that's going to like, none of your work is tied into anything.
00:59:48 There's no reason people would click on this stuff.
00:59:50 There's no reason anyone would seek this out.
00:59:52 And I was like, there's nothing me and you can do together because I do my work by myself.
00:59:58 You are not involved with anime at all.
01:00:00 Parkour is an urban colloquialism which is used for shortening.
01:00:04 It really interests me how outside people will hear that like two people work on YouTube
01:00:09 and assume that it's like at all similar.
01:00:12 It's hilarious.
01:00:13 You do the same job.
01:00:14 Hey man, I don't want you reviewing this movie.
01:00:17 Oh, not you again.
01:00:18 I don't want you reviewing this movie with me.
01:00:21 Well, I mean, look at all of us.
01:00:22 We barely collab and we're all best friends who do the same thing.
01:00:27 Like we all cover video games and anime and even we don't like leave it for the podcasts
01:00:31 because it's not something you want to do.
01:00:33 It doesn't make good content, you know?
01:00:35 And like, the funniest thing for me is my dad has it in his head.
01:00:39 Like, because he's always been supportive of what I'm doing.
01:00:42 He kind of gets it on some level.
01:00:44 But he has it in his head that I'm eventually going to end up on TV.
01:00:48 Like, he really thinks for some reason that I'm...
01:00:51 Oh, just like my hero, Jon Tron is going to do well.
01:00:53 Yes.
01:00:54 Jon Tron was on TV.
01:00:56 Yeah.
01:00:57 What?
01:00:58 He was on a commercial once.
01:00:59 No, but like, I think...
01:01:00 Okay, but the comparisons...
01:01:01 No, my dad thinks I'm going to become a TV personality.
01:01:04 Like, my dad thinks I'm going to get hired by a news network at some point and be like a TV guy.
01:01:08 And I'm just like...
01:01:09 The local news anime review guy.
01:01:12 That actually is a thing.
01:01:14 That actually...
01:01:15 There was one time, for a brief period,
01:01:18 we had the Hampton Roads show, like the local area news,
01:01:21 and they had like an anime block for like a short period of time.
01:01:24 Late at night at like 3 a.m.
01:01:26 I saw it once and I was like, what the fuck is happening?
01:01:29 It was so weird.
01:01:30 They were probably copying the Dolce and William or something, I guess.
01:01:32 No, it wasn't shows.
01:01:33 It was like talking about anime.
01:01:34 Like, local area.
01:01:36 Here's a way that maybe would work with some people's dads is explain this.
01:01:40 About half the people who watch YouTube have ad block and therefore don't see the ads, right?
01:01:44 Right.
01:01:45 Whereas 100% of people who watch TV fast forward through the ads now.
01:01:50 So there, there's the business discipline difference.
01:01:52 Can they do that?
01:01:53 And also no young people watch TV.
01:01:54 Oh yeah, that too.
01:01:55 Yeah, that's true.
01:01:56 So here's like a thing.
01:01:58 It's pretty bad when your parents are like, oh, you're going to be a TV person someday.
01:02:02 As a way of justifying to themselves what you do for a living.
01:02:05 My parents are very accepting of what I do and they think that it's, it's really cool
01:02:10 and they, they understand that I know better than them that there is actually a future in it.
01:02:15 That's nice.
01:02:16 That's nice.
01:02:17 But the other thing that you get all the time when you're a YouTuber is people giving you suggestions for shows.
01:02:23 Oh yeah.
01:02:24 Oh yeah.
01:02:25 And they're all terrible.
01:02:27 They're all bad.
01:02:28 They're all bad.
01:02:29 So you did like, what if you went to like restaurants and did reviews?
01:02:34 I'm like, cause they're all in Virginia Beach and no one who watches me is in Virginia Beach.
01:02:38 You know.
01:02:39 What if, what if, what if you, you know, you're called mother's basement.
01:02:42 What if you gave your mom a vlog show?
01:02:45 I bet people would watch that.
01:02:47 Oh my God.
01:02:48 Mom vlogs.
01:02:49 Mother's basement's mother.
01:02:50 There was one time, one time I was babysitting my aunt's kids and she was telling me that
01:02:55 she really wanted to start up a vlog channel where she just like ranted about stuff.
01:02:59 And I was like, about what kind of stuff?
01:03:01 And she's like, I don't know, just stuff.
01:03:03 She doesn't have a TV, like a, like a presence for camera at all.
01:03:07 She talks really slow.
01:03:08 Well, hey, that's like a big fat old lady.
01:03:11 Oh, you guys show her Angela at all.
01:03:13 That's the only president I know for that on YouTube.
01:03:16 I mean, there are, there are like older people who are on YouTube doing rants.
01:03:20 Like I wouldn't be surprised to see a 40 year old mother on there.
01:03:22 Just, she doesn't even watch YouTube.
01:03:25 So like this whole idea is like, what do you think you're going to do?
01:03:27 You don't know what the trends are.
01:03:28 You don't know what you're trying to do.
01:03:29 Hey man, nothing's impossible.
01:03:30 Go watch the new Storyteller.
01:03:31 She didn't know what she was going to film it on.
01:03:32 You know, anything.
01:03:33 Anyone could be a YouTuber.
01:03:34 Yeah, the new Storyteller is so successful.
01:03:36 Yeah.
01:03:37 Yeah.
01:03:38 But like the procrastinators, that's a pretty big plug if I do say so myself.
01:03:41 Yes, true.
01:03:42 If that's the, if that's the highest that you've reached, then that's a very sad statement.
01:03:45 But you know, it's, it's not even that my dad,
01:03:47 Not that I don't love your new Storyteller.
01:03:48 My dad thinks I'm going to end up on TV because that would be like, you know, like what he wants from me.
01:03:52 It's just that he thinks of that as like the ultimate version of what I do.
01:03:56 Like TV is the, the final frontier, you know, and I'm like,
01:03:59 As opposed to your dying competition.
01:04:02 Right.
01:04:03 And like for me, I'm thinking like TV's on the way out.
01:04:06 It's going to be done.
01:04:07 It's not going to last much longer.
01:04:09 And like, you know, you'd have to be like, think about how like you get a guy like a,
01:04:15 Who's the dude who hosts at midnight?
01:04:17 Chris Hardwick is like the host of at midnight.
01:04:22 He's the host of several other talk shows.
01:04:23 He does the talking of the dead.
01:04:24 He does all these shows.
01:04:25 And I'm like, that's one guy occupying like over an hour of TV every night.
01:04:31 Right.
01:04:32 So that means that the talent pool is pretty small.
01:04:35 If you're at the top, you're in all kinds of stuff, you know, because you're the best guy.
01:04:39 Everybody wants you.
01:04:40 So there's only like a couple hundred people who are like TV hosts who are making real money.
01:04:45 And everyone else is on a local news station and they're probably making less than I make now.
01:04:50 You know, I'm making like over $40,000 a year this year.
01:04:54 If I make the same amount I have been making so far.
01:04:57 That's a damn good salary.
01:04:58 Yeah, I'm making fucking, you know, gotta think middle-class wages.
01:05:01 I think PewDiePie has really helped to evolve everyone's understanding of YouTube, including other YouTubers.
01:05:07 Because so many people know him.
01:05:08 Most people know he's a millionaire now.
01:05:10 And also the fact that he's like a real guy who doesn't feel like a shill.
01:05:15 And I think that's probably, I bet PewDiePie single-handedly has, or single-swededly progressed YouTube content so far.
01:05:23 What?
01:05:24 Because he's made, you can be like a real guy who's actually kind of charming and become the biggest guy.
01:05:30 He does create sort of an inverse problem though where people are like, oh, you should have 100,000 subscribers.
01:05:37 Well, you want people to think that, especially if it's like a girl and you're trying to like pick her up.
01:05:44 I guess if it's a girl, then yes.
01:05:46 That's very true.
01:05:47 You want to make that.
01:05:48 No, I, yeah, it's, it is a problem that people think you're rich just for having like a certain amount of subs.
01:05:53 But like, and it's also really fascinating to see like what people, what kind of selling out people think will work and what kind doesn't.
01:06:00 Because like, I want you all to look up Daim Drops, D-A-Y-M Drops, and look at-
01:06:07 I know about Daim.
01:06:08 Have you seen his Patreon?
01:06:12 It is the most hilariously depressing thing.
01:06:16 Because Daim Drops is a guy, he's this big fat black guy who sits in his car and reviews fast food from outside of the point.
01:06:24 Oh yeah, that guy.
01:06:26 He jumped.
01:06:31 That's a lot more.
01:06:32 That's a lot more than he was making when he started it.
01:06:35 Like, here's the thing.
01:06:36 Daim Drops started, he got big because of the Daim, Daim, Daim, Shmo Yoho song, right?
01:06:42 Shmo Yoho is huge.
01:06:43 Yeah, right.
01:06:44 So he gets pretty big through that.
01:06:45 He's got like over 100,000 subs, I think, right?
01:06:47 Where the heck is he?
01:06:48 He's got like 18 fucking dollars?
01:06:50 What the heck's going on?
01:06:51 He makes-
01:06:52 Take his word for it.
01:06:53 He has a pretty high subscriber count, right?
01:06:55 And he's considered like a part of the YouTube club kind of thing.
01:06:59 He's been out to the YouTube space, he's been invited to Taco Bell to do tastings of their new products for videos and stuff like that.
01:07:05 He's done endorsements and shit like that.
01:07:07 Guys, I think, and one of the factors that he doesn't seem to link his Patreon anywhere.
01:07:11 I had to just-
01:07:12 No, no, no, let me get to it.
01:07:13 He has a Wikipedia page, guys.
01:07:15 Let me get to it.
01:07:16 He's fairly well known as a YouTube personality, but here's the thing.
01:07:21 His videos are like five minutes.
01:07:23 The first 40 seconds is,
01:07:25 What's up, YouTube?
01:07:26 Facebook?
01:07:27 Twitter?
01:07:28 It's a main man, Dave Drost with another super official food review.
01:07:31 Can you take it, baby?
01:07:32 I know you can.
01:07:33 Hey, listen, man.
01:07:34 That's his intro.
01:07:35 Every video.
01:07:36 I can't believe I could still do that.
01:07:37 Sounds like a Hodge Twin sort of thing.
01:07:38 Yeah.
01:07:39 Well, he'll then, he'll get his food and he'll eat it and he'll talk about it and he'll give it a ranking out of five, right?
01:07:46 It is-
01:07:47 There's not a lot to it.
01:07:48 It's something literally anybody could do.
01:07:50 Like, yeah, he has-
01:07:51 But he just delivers his opinion on said food with so much personality.
01:07:54 Right, yeah.
01:07:55 He has a lot of gusto to it, but like, every video is the same thing.
01:07:58 If you watch one, you get it, you know?
01:08:00 And it's fucking fast food reviews.
01:08:02 And they're like three minutes long.
01:08:04 And so he makes a Patreon at one point.
01:08:06 And part of the problem here is, and I'm also giving this as advice to everybody,
01:08:12 your Patreon rewards, no matter what they are,
01:08:16 the numbers that you mark are like really psychologically controlling to your audience.
01:08:23 Yeah, yeah.
01:08:24 Because if you set, like, if you have it going, if you have a $1 tier,
01:08:28 like on mine, I made one that just said, for the longest time, all it said was $1,
01:08:32 and it said, I will love you forever.
01:08:34 And just by having that $1 tier, it makes people realize that they can give you $1,
01:08:39 and so they will, you know?
01:08:40 Yeah.
01:08:41 They have shit tons of $1 patrons because of that.
01:08:43 Whereas Daimdrop started off, and his first tier was like $40.
01:08:48 Yeah.
01:08:49 Because he was giving out like a lot of stuff,
01:08:52 but it was like a $40 tier and like $100 tier.
01:08:54 Oh man, you know what I saw?
01:08:55 And so as a result, he gained zero patrons for a long time.
01:09:01 A guy with over 100,000 subs had zero patrons.
01:09:06 You know what I've seen is that there are some people,
01:09:08 some patron pages where the first reward is like,
01:09:11 I'll thank you and also like, I'll give you a sticker
01:09:13 or I'll say hi on Twitter, and it's $2 as the first reward.
01:09:17 And I don't know if Patreon is still like this,
01:09:20 but at least earlier before the redesign,
01:09:22 when you go over and click on the Become a Patron button,
01:09:25 the number $1 is already in there,
01:09:27 but if it starts out at $2 as the first reward,
01:09:30 the default will be $2.
01:09:33 You sneaky bastards.
01:09:35 Me and Ben did that for our T-Bat patron
01:09:38 because there were two of us.
01:09:39 Was there justification?
01:09:41 I mean, I didn't do it for any sneaky reason,
01:09:44 but my first level is $5 just because.
01:09:49 So my Patreon is, I think, pretty successful.
01:09:53 I think it's the second most successful of ours
01:09:55 out of after-digies.
01:09:57 True.
01:09:58 Well, I don't think you make as much as Jesse makes
01:10:00 just because he patrons a lot more stuff.
01:10:02 Yeah, probably.
01:10:04 But because I'm on a monthly basis because I don't want to.
01:10:09 Oh, yeah, yeah.
01:10:10 I just want people to be like,
01:10:12 I know how much money I'm paying each month.
01:10:14 Right.
01:10:15 But so I went to people I know
01:10:19 who have successful Patreons at the very beginning
01:10:23 before I even put it up, and I asked them for advice.
01:10:26 So the extra credits, guys,
01:10:28 and I think I asked you, Digi,
01:10:31 for at least input on my reward tier.
01:10:34 And I actually got put through to somebody at Patreon
01:10:38 who gave me additional advice.
01:10:40 And you were talking about the psychological priming
01:10:43 of your reward tiers.
01:10:45 Oh, yeah.
01:10:46 Essential.
01:10:47 Yeah.
01:10:48 So what you want to have is you want to have five reward tiers
01:10:52 between $1 and $10.
01:10:55 Because that creates like...
01:10:57 People at every level.
01:10:58 Yeah.
01:10:59 So that creates like a breadcrumb trail effect, right?
01:11:03 Where people will be like, oh, well, I mean,
01:11:05 I'm pledging $1.
01:11:07 I pledge two more dollars.
01:11:09 Exactly.
01:11:10 I get my name listed in a video at the end of the year.
01:11:13 I pledge $2 more than that.
01:11:15 I get to...
01:11:16 I pledge $2 more than the monthly Q&A.
01:11:19 Suddenly I get to join you for an anime night
01:11:21 where we hang out.
01:11:22 And it's really fascinating to see like
01:11:24 what people will pay for just because it's listed.
01:11:27 If you have a $15 tier and it's got...
01:11:31 And it's like limit 10 or something,
01:11:33 it could be fucking anything.
01:11:35 Just the fact that it's there means certain people
01:11:37 who have the money will pay that amount.
01:11:39 I think very, very few people really are interested
01:11:43 in the rewards most of the time.
01:11:46 It's more about suggesting to them that...
01:11:48 When people pledge to a patron, what they're really buying
01:11:50 is like a place in the narrative of the person.
01:11:52 But it's just funny because it's not
01:11:54 that they're going for the higher rewards
01:11:56 because I think there's a lot of people...
01:11:58 If you have...
01:11:59 If you're highest reward, mine goes $1, $3, $5.
01:12:03 So there's not a lot of stuff.
01:12:05 And most of the pledges I get are either $3 or $5.
01:12:08 Since implementing those ones, I mostly get stuff on that level.
01:12:11 There's probably a lot of people who if I had a $10 reward,
01:12:15 they would just raise it to $10 just because it exists.
01:12:19 And they think, oh, there's a reason to be 10.
01:12:23 Even if the $10 reward was nothing all that special
01:12:27 in relation to how much it costs.
01:12:29 It's just that I don't want to offer anything.
01:12:33 You only need the big rewards when you get to $80, $150
01:12:38 somewhere around there, which I've got people
01:12:41 who've bought into that from the beginning.
01:12:43 And I'm really grateful for that because it's helpful.
01:12:46 Although it is a lot of work to get that stuff actually made.
01:12:50 And big level patrons are scary because if they leave, you lose a lot.
01:12:55 That's true.
01:12:56 It's nicer to have a lot of $1 guys who can come and go.
01:13:00 That's why it's smart to limit your big level patron tiers
01:13:05 because then if they do leave for whatever reason,
01:13:09 there's somebody else who wanted that for a while and will buy in there.
01:13:14 I only have two levels of pledge rewards
01:13:18 and neither one of them is really a reward.
01:13:21 All you get is $5.
01:13:23 There's no real benefit except I post my stuff there first.
01:13:27 So in the long run, it doesn't matter.
01:13:29 But I didn't design them as rewards.
01:13:31 I just designed them as pledge this if you want to support me,
01:13:35 pledge this much if you really want to support me.
01:13:37 And that's it.
01:13:38 And I think it's been pretty successful.
01:13:40 I'm actually kind of surprised it's gotten as high as it has.
01:13:43 Funnily enough, once again,
01:13:45 we really haven't been talking about the concept of selling out so much
01:13:49 as this is now a guide on how to sell out.
01:13:51 I'm about to sell out.
01:13:52 So I'm going to give a piece of advice for the mindset.
01:13:54 So hang on.
01:13:55 Hang on.
01:13:56 I remember.
01:13:57 Just real quick, sell out mindset.
01:13:58 So there's this band called Clipping.
01:14:00 They have two songs that you need in your life.
01:14:03 The first one is a song called Outro from their first album, Mid City.
01:14:08 It's 10 minutes of a guy going,
01:14:09 Get money, get money, get money, get money, get money, get money, get money.
01:14:14 But it's two audio tracks that slowly desynchronize and over the course of it
01:14:19 and then re-synchronize at the end.
01:14:21 So it's just this chaotic train of get money.
01:14:24 It's like a hypnotic drug.
01:14:26 Play that when you go to bed.
01:14:28 When you go to bed at night, listen to the outro and just leave it on repeat.
01:14:33 And you'll easily pass out.
01:14:34 It just sounds like my choice.
01:14:35 Then here's the better part, though.
01:14:37 They also have a song called, I believe it's Get Up, something like that.
01:14:42 It's a song where it's the lead singer rapping over an alarm clock as the beat.
01:14:47 The beat is just,
01:14:50 And then he starts,
01:14:51 So set this as your alarm because the first lines in the song are,
01:14:55 Game, don't wait, hold up, wait, eyes on the ground, motherfucker, can't be late.
01:14:59 And so when you hear that, like, it wakes you up.
01:15:01 And then the first thing you hear is like, game, don't wait.
01:15:03 You're like, oh, shit.
01:15:04 And I always just jump out of bed and I'm like, all right.
01:15:06 It's time to fucking get money, get money, get money.
01:15:09 Use these two songs to program yourself.
01:15:11 Absolutely.
01:15:12 I'm working on a video.
01:15:13 I'm getting tired.
01:15:14 I'm getting weird.
01:15:15 I'm getting delirious.
01:15:16 My eyes start to go down, but then deep for someone within me, I'm just like,
01:15:19 Get money, get money, get money.
01:15:21 I come back up and I keep on going, get money, get money.
01:15:24 So I think the reason that this has become like a how to sell out video is because all of us are in favor of it.
01:15:32 Yeah, we all agree.
01:15:33 Except for maybe Jesse, but Jesse's style.
01:15:37 Maybe he is.
01:15:38 He just has the hardest time coming around to doing it.
01:15:41 Yeah.
01:15:42 Well, I don't think we're in favor of selling out.
01:15:45 We're in favor of like...
01:15:47 Monetizing our work, our fucking brutalized work we put thousands of hours into.
01:15:51 Getting money for your work and trying to get money for your work is not the same thing as selling out.
01:15:55 All right, listen to this.
01:15:56 Listen to this.
01:15:57 Let me break it down real quick.
01:15:58 Because there is abs...
01:15:59 If you want to spend your time, if you want to go to your nine to five and survive on that
01:16:03 and then come home and be your pure artistic ivory tower guy who doesn't involve money,
01:16:07 who doesn't corrupt your art with money, then that's fine.
01:16:09 You can do that as much as you want.
01:16:11 But if you want to be able to do that as your lifestyle, you have to monetize it.
01:16:15 You have to be able to survive by doing it and you need to come up with strategies to do so.
01:16:19 And that is why I want to say like when a while back, before Matthew Matosis made his Patreon,
01:16:25 he was expressing, and several people do, was expressing concerns.
01:16:29 I think Jeff was doing this too, about like, oh, if I make my Patreon, will people not like it?
01:16:33 Will people think I'm a sellout?
01:16:35 But to me, there is no case whatsoever to be made for something like a Patreon,
01:16:40 because it is purely a voluntary thing that people, based on love for you and wanting your content.
01:16:47 And that's why I really like the model of Patreon where you don't actually give them anything
01:16:52 other than like Ben said, a place in the narrative, and they're solely there to support.
01:16:56 To sincere thank you and like the right to call themselves like a true fan or whatever.
01:17:00 Exactly right, exactly right.
01:17:02 And so, but the core issue here is that there is nothing at all to be ashamed of monetizing your hard-ass work.
01:17:11 And I want that meme to die big time.
01:17:14 My Patreon has a ton of perks, but all of them are nothing.
01:17:18 They're just weird little words.
01:17:21 Well, I actually made some of my rewards.
01:17:24 I've changed them a couple of times. I don't even remember what they are.
01:17:27 But I remember specifically trying to make big level tiers that make it to where I am going to do things
01:17:33 that I want to do anyway, but can never justify the time for it otherwise.
01:17:37 That's a good reward.
01:17:39 I'm gonna talk about something that I think Jesse would be in full support of if he was here.
01:17:44 Jesse, if you're here, we're talking to things relevant to you.
01:17:48 Jesse's secretary, please get Jesse in.
01:17:51 Jesse's talked before about how like, for instance, when the whole where's the fair use thing came up,
01:17:57 Jesse was like, none of this really affects me because if we lost, if we lost the fair use battle
01:18:04 and I can't use footage of my videos anymore, I just have to become inventive and figure out how to make it work, right?
01:18:09 And like that mindset is kind of how I feel about like all this monetization stuff
01:18:14 is that to me, it's not about compromising my art and now I have to sell out.
01:18:19 Now it's a challenge. How can I uniquely work this into my narrative?
01:18:25 And so like, I have a Crunchyroll link where if you go to crunchyroll.com slash digibro and sign up for an account,
01:18:32 I get $5, right?
01:18:34 So like, I already had a series that was five must see anime you can watch right now,
01:18:39 where I talk about five shows that are available for free legal streaming.
01:18:42 So like, it was totally obvious to make that into now a Crunchyroll ad basically, right?
01:18:47 Because it's already what it was, is just, here's five cool shows I want you to watch.
01:18:51 Now I have also, you can make me money by doing it.
01:18:54 But that even was, that was like a little successful for making me Crunchyroll money.
01:18:59 Made like, you know, $75 or so.
01:19:01 But then I made way more because of the asterisk where sucks videos,
01:19:05 because I'm going on this epic tirade about how shitty this show is.
01:19:10 And then I managed to work in, right?
01:19:13 Well, no, it's even better because there's a part in part two of the asterisk where sucks.
01:19:17 This is when I first had gotten the Crunchyroll thing.
01:19:19 I do this thing where I say, you know, if you're watching this show on Crunchyroll,
01:19:23 you can easily click over and there's five other shows that have all the stuff this show has and are better.
01:19:29 Right, right.
01:19:30 And I go to this whole thing and you don't know that it's a setup for anything.
01:19:33 Like, I'm just talking about like, you know, even if I, I said like,
01:19:37 even if I was only allowed to watch anime on Crunchyroll and I couldn't click on anything else,
01:19:41 my browser was locked there.
01:19:42 I still have six other shows I can watch.
01:19:44 By the way, you can watch those shows using this Crunchyroll link that gets you to my account.
01:19:48 It was one of the smartest things I've ever written.
01:19:51 And people loved that.
01:19:53 I made way more money for Crunchyroll subscriptions than I did for that
01:19:56 than by an entire video just advertising Crunchyroll.
01:20:00 People thought it was so, I actually had people commenting like,
01:20:02 I signed up for Crunchyroll just because of how clever that ad was.
01:20:05 Yeah.
01:20:06 And you know, if you want to get like a master guide on how to always do a sponsor,
01:20:09 but always make it seem natural without seeming awkward.
01:20:12 Biggest problem in the universe.
01:20:13 Go vote it up.
01:20:14 Go listen to them.
01:20:15 Yeah.
01:20:16 They always, they only have like, they only have Harry's, Razor's and Casper mattresses
01:20:20 and sometimes Audible.
01:20:21 That's all they ever do.
01:20:22 It's been a hundred episodes, those same three ads of same three sponsors,
01:20:26 but they always segue into it interestingly and funny.
01:20:29 They always have like some funny thing to say about it.
01:20:31 It always feels good.
01:20:33 Right.
01:20:34 That's cool.
01:20:35 I'm a fan of how the two best friends guys do that on the super best friendcast.
01:20:40 Like they're, they don't do the ads live while they're podcasting.
01:20:46 They have them sort of pre-recorded, but they always have them like funny
01:20:50 and they have them be conversations that they would have on the podcast
01:20:54 that just happen to relate to Casper mattresses usually or flower ordering.
01:21:00 Right.
01:21:02 You know what we should do is we should monetize this video and put eight in video ads
01:21:06 every like 15 minutes.
01:21:07 Right.
01:21:08 That's a great idea.
01:21:09 Oh, that reminds me of.
01:21:10 So I had an idea to effort how to sell out and get the procrastinators podcast
01:21:16 to be the most successful podcast on the internet without, without any effort
01:21:21 whatsoever on our part when it comes to editing.
01:21:24 And that is, that is take our overlay with our faces on it.
01:21:27 Right.
01:21:28 And then just put that over extended footage of somebody playing counter strike go race
01:21:34 maps.
01:21:35 Yeah.
01:21:36 Just do that.
01:21:37 Oh, oh, what a great idea.
01:21:39 You know, I, I, I me and Davud did a commentary on this recently where there was a Pokemon
01:21:44 video I made and it was 15 minutes long.
01:21:47 And right in the middle of it, I did a who's that Pokemon.
01:21:50 And then I put an in video ad there so that it would be a commercial break.
01:21:54 And then after the video ad, it goes, it's onyx or whatever.
01:21:58 And so I was like, you know, on the one hand, it's a clever joke, but it also makes me more
01:22:02 money.
01:22:03 Yeah.
01:22:04 That's the best kind of joke of all.
01:22:05 That's the best way to do it though.
01:22:06 Like if you're looking at, if you're looking at the sell out stuff, you're like, uh, I
01:22:10 just had to force these ads into my videos and it always looks like that you don't want
01:22:13 to do it.
01:22:14 That makes it doubly.
01:22:15 I don't want to see it.
01:22:16 Like, like, you know, uh, like at the end of a, like a Tommy Oliver video or something,
01:22:20 if he's like talking about some service, he's clearly never used and doesn't care about.
01:22:24 And I'm just like, well, you obviously don't even buy into this.
01:22:27 You know, like for me personally, and the biggest problem in the universe is like this
01:22:30 as well.
01:22:31 They only endorse products that they use where they all got the Harry's razors and they all
01:22:35 love them.
01:22:36 Maddox has a Casper mattress, you know, and so, and I, I have both now as a result.
01:22:41 I've actually bought both because I trusted Maddox's word on them.
01:22:45 And you know, I know he's a guy who would want a high quality product.
01:22:48 So mattress is really that good.
01:22:50 They're pretty good.
01:22:51 I would say it's better.
01:22:52 Like, Earth, can I get these magical mattresses?
01:22:55 Oh, if only we actually, if only we actually got a promo code.
01:22:58 Right.
01:22:59 That would be excellent.
01:23:00 That would be getting paid for this shit.
01:23:01 I actually, I've, I've been prepared, like I was going to, um, like make a video of me
01:23:07 like whenever I shave, I'm going to do like a Harry's promo and just save it so that if
01:23:12 I ever get a Harry's endorsement, I'll have a video of me shaving with the razors to use
01:23:17 a promo.
01:23:18 You should get a victim film that.
01:23:19 I had that idea for ever.
01:23:20 Right.
01:23:21 Yeah.
01:23:22 And it is that I have to do it shirtless and that's creepy.
01:23:25 So, but, um, but anyways, like for me, the reason I waited until crunchy rolls, because
01:23:31 I actually use crunchy rolls.
01:23:33 So it's like, when I talk about it, I know everything about it.
01:23:37 I can tell you what shows are on there and what's worth watching and what are the pros
01:23:40 and cons of using it.
01:23:42 And, uh, you know, I don't like taking up endorsements with shit that I don't, that
01:23:46 I wouldn't use.
01:23:47 And you'll see this in my fucking hilarious videos about like those random boxes where
01:23:51 I had like two different, two different random box companies send me them.
01:23:55 And I, I, I did the videos on my after dark channel, which I didn't tell them I was going
01:23:58 to do, but like, you know, they offered me, I don't know.
01:24:02 So they sent me a box and I sit on my after dark channel and I, my conclusion is always,
01:24:06 well, I would never pay for this, but since I got it for free, it's kind of cool.
01:24:10 Like if you actually think this is worth your money, here's a link, you know, because like
01:24:14 I'm not going to lie about it.
01:24:16 And I think people really like that and it, they might even be more likely to buy it if
01:24:21 it is something that they think is interesting just because, you know, I'm not being like
01:24:25 so like, like when fucking, uh, George Weidman did that Luke crate ad, like there was a little
01:24:31 bit in there where you could tell that he was kind of like whatever, you know, like
01:24:35 he, he, he pulls out this shirt and he's like, there was more than a little, he was like
01:24:39 this, uh, labyrinth t-shirt cause, uh, David Bowie is cool, right?
01:24:43 Like, you know, that's the worst, shut up, George, shut the fuck up.
01:24:47 But I thought that was funny.
01:24:48 It was, it was humoring to show like he didn't pretend that he loved it.
01:24:52 You know, he didn't pretend like, oh, it's so worth it.
01:24:55 I got all this great stuff, which like whenever those companies like ask you to do something
01:24:59 for you, they send you other people, like other YouTubers videos who have done it and
01:25:03 they're always so full of shit.
01:25:06 It's always a guy who's like, oh wow, I got my new crate box.
01:25:10 It's going to be so cool.
01:25:12 I got an offer for this recently.
01:25:14 David's job.
01:25:15 I want to say a relevant thing first.
01:25:16 The documentary thing, right?
01:25:17 I got an offer from this, uh, the documentary company.
01:25:18 They sent you the video where the chick has these giant tits.
01:25:20 They sent me the one of the, the massive chick, the massive tits chick.
01:25:24 And she's great.
01:25:25 She really sold the shit out of that product, but, uh, I could never, I could never, I honestly
01:25:29 think that all the views.
01:25:30 I would die if I tried.
01:25:31 That video, it's like this woman with giant tits and she's just like, it's just a straight
01:25:36 up like six minute advertisement for this documentary company.
01:25:40 But like, it's only got like 5,000 views.
01:25:41 She's like a vlogger anyway.
01:25:43 So I feel like all the views on it are from other people that they sent the video to.
01:25:47 Yeah.
01:25:48 But you know, that really works for her cause she's like a vlogger anyway, that I don't
01:25:51 think people really care about anything other than her massive tits.
01:25:54 I also, uh, have taken that endorsement from the documentary company.
01:25:58 They are sending me a, they're sending me a pillow and a mouse pad and, uh, what?
01:26:04 They said they wouldn't send me a fucking pillow.
01:26:06 No, no, no, no, not the, not the inner pillow.
01:26:09 They're sending me the case.
01:26:10 Like, I want a fucking case.
01:26:12 Give those guys, I offered to use one in a fucking video and they were like, well, maybe
01:26:17 tell those guys about me.
01:26:18 Did you?
01:26:19 I want a documentary.
01:26:20 I'll do it.
01:26:21 It was, you know, the thing is though, and here's how I'm going to do it though, because
01:26:24 I'm like a hundred percent certain that that side is not legit at all.
01:26:28 Like it's, none of those are official documentary.
01:26:31 They're all for shows that don't have them.
01:26:33 They're super racing.
01:26:34 They're all way cheap.
01:26:36 So like in my video, I'm going to be like, so is this legal product?
01:26:41 Probably not.
01:26:42 Do you want to pay $50 for a hot, uh, lolly on your bed?
01:26:46 It's really up to you, man.
01:26:50 Yeah.
01:26:51 I, yeah.
01:26:52 So here's my question for you, Digi.
01:26:55 Did you ever, uh, actually accept that polygamy website, uh, promotion?
01:27:00 Oh shit.
01:27:01 And do, do a video about how to have your own harem.
01:27:04 Yeah.
01:27:05 I usually just forgot about that, but yeah, that would have been a great idea.
01:27:08 I have had that on my mind forever because I wanted to see that fucking video.
01:27:12 Dude, dude, work that into a review of like high school DXD or like something, I don't
01:27:16 know, whatever.
01:27:17 The problem is I get so many offers from stuff all the time that I, that I ignore that like
01:27:21 I just really don't, because most of it's shit I would never want to advertise.
01:27:24 Like there's this one dude who keeps fucking emailing me about like a, it's like some browser
01:27:28 based, uh, game site where it's like one of those where you buy coins.
01:27:32 It's like it's free to play games, but you buy like currency and they're, but they're
01:27:36 like anime themed and they've all got like really nice looking, like cute girl, anime
01:27:40 art, but they're all like these really shitty, weird tactics games, dude, the other day that
01:27:45 just reminds me just yesterday, I was at work, like finishing up some shit and, uh, like
01:27:50 all the, I get a pop up.
01:27:52 That's just like literally honey pop only like re skinned and like with, with like, you
01:27:57 have to like buy, like it's, it's like a Facebook game.
01:27:59 So it's like you get energy and you use it up and you have to buy more to keep playing.
01:28:03 Like, and it was just in a fucking pop up.
01:28:05 The entirety of honey pop was there.
01:28:07 Only someone in fucking stolen.
01:28:08 And you see, I think this is why, um, there aren't that many big advertised, uh, sponsored
01:28:13 people out there.
01:28:14 It's just audible and a few others is because most YouTubers who are worth a damn, uh, have
01:28:18 too much integrity like compared to anything else we've had before.
01:28:22 Well, it's also, because like you can't have like any, like you're, you're so much more
01:28:27 that, that's one of the great things about YouTube is that everybody is so much more
01:28:31 accountable than they were back in the days of TV.
01:28:34 If you were a big shield, you're going to have a lot of explaining about it.
01:28:36 And I think that might be why they're social sponsors.
01:28:39 You're kind of right and kind of wrong because a lot of these guys, a lot of these guys
01:28:44 who, who approached me, they do get a lot of people, but they're all small YouTubers.
01:28:49 And the reason is that they usually don't really offer you that much.
01:28:52 Like all those, the reason I made those box videos on the after dark is because they didn't
01:28:57 actually pay me.
01:28:58 They just sent me free boxes.
01:29:00 The box is worth 20 bucks.
01:29:02 You know, like for me, a full video on my main channel, that's worth like, like, you
01:29:07 know, now what, $800 almost, like for, for, for Patreon.
01:29:12 So like with the, like the Campani girls, which is that, uh, browser game, they were
01:29:16 like, if you advertise us, we'll give you like $350.
01:29:19 And I'm like, that's not worth, like I make more than that.
01:29:22 Like if the amount of time I would spend on your video, I could spend making my own
01:29:27 video that would make more money for people trying to sponsor things are very strapped
01:29:32 for cash financially.
01:29:34 They're, yes, they're all very shady and strapped for cash.
01:29:37 And like even the documentary guys, like they offered to send me a pillow and a mousepad.
01:29:42 And that was like, I actually haggled with them because like initially they were like,
01:29:46 we want to send you, uh, we want to send you a pillowcase and we'll send you the inner,
01:29:50 or they said, we want to send you a pillowcase and you'll make a video about it.
01:29:52 And they had like all these bullet points that want to be to address.
01:29:55 And I said, how about I just work it into a regular video?
01:29:59 Cause I already had this plan in mind that I'm going to get a pillowcase for a show
01:30:02 that I plan to talk about in the near future.
01:30:04 So I'll just bring it up in that video like I did with the crunchy roll thing.
01:30:08 It'll be hilarious.
01:30:09 And that'll sell way more.
01:30:10 And they were like, well, if we throw in the inner pillow, will you make a video?
01:30:14 And I was like, no, I've got an inner pillow.
01:30:16 It'll be fine.
01:30:17 Right.
01:30:17 And then they were like, well, how about we throw in a mousepad?
01:30:20 Then we're like, they just said, how about we throw in a mousepad?
01:30:23 Okay.
01:30:23 Why do they want a worse marketing?
01:30:25 Why do they want worse marketing?
01:30:27 Well, they don't want to chase.
01:30:29 Why don't we throw it out about the fact that they're broke?
01:30:31 Like you're not supposed to do that.
01:30:33 Well, no, no, no.
01:30:34 Then they said, how about we throw in the mousepad and they just want me to make
01:30:38 like a full advertisement so they could show it around.
01:30:40 You know, so like, so they're like, what if we throw in a mousepad?
01:30:43 And I said, I'll tell you what, if you throw in the mousepad, I'll make a video
01:30:47 on my after dark channel, which has 30,000 subscribers.
01:30:51 And so they agreed to that.
01:30:52 So I'm going to do like a regular ad video for them on after dark.
01:30:55 And then I can just promote it my own way.
01:30:57 Now they are giving me a discount code.
01:30:59 I actually don't know if they plan to pay me based on that code.
01:31:03 Like if I'm going to make any money from them having this discount code.
01:31:07 Yeah.
01:31:07 Well, what else would the point be?
01:31:08 Well, they said that they were going to like track the metrics and they would
01:31:11 keep sit like basically they'll keep sending you more shit if you if you're
01:31:15 successful, like if you drive more traffic, which for me is like, all right,
01:31:19 I'd rather have money, but I will never spend money on these
01:31:23 anime pillowcases, but I would love to have them.
01:31:25 So like this is a it's a fun way for me to get a bunch of cool pillowcases,
01:31:30 you know, like that I wouldn't pay for because they're not even legal fucking,
01:31:34 you know, like they're not making any money for the people who made the shows.
01:31:38 So like so it's it'll be fun for me.
01:31:41 It's something I want.
01:31:42 So I'm willing to accept it.
01:31:43 But like, yeah, most of these advertisers, they make it out like
01:31:47 they're going to give you something special.
01:31:48 But they're really like for someone at my level, it's not even worth it.
01:31:52 Whereas with like Crunchyroll and Audible, they give you like a lot of money
01:31:56 for those refer like Crunchyroll gives me $5 for everyone who signs up.
01:31:59 You don't even have to make a paid account.
01:32:00 You just sign up at all using my link.
01:32:02 I really need to get on the people I know at Crunchyroll to get the fucking
01:32:07 crunchy code. No.
01:32:09 And the problem is that everyone's doing it though.
01:32:11 H3H3 has it.
01:32:12 John Tron has it, you know, same with Audible.
01:32:14 But the reason people keep still using Audible is that I'm pretty sure they
01:32:17 pay even more because it costs like a they give you a free month.
01:32:21 But as I found out the hard way, it doesn't.
01:32:26 It's one of those that auto refreshes at the end of the month.
01:32:29 So if you don't unsubscribe from it like I didn't, you end up paying
01:32:32 $15 a month for eight months and then you have to make a large
01:32:36 splurging day on audiobooks, which you had already realized a long time ago
01:32:39 were not your thing.
01:32:40 So now I have eight audiobooks I haven't listened to and like a hundred
01:32:44 dollars that I accidentally spent on Audible.
01:32:47 But those things are really successful.
01:32:49 And that's like, I realized how much they must make when it was
01:32:54 because I watch Bro Science and he's always had an audible thing.
01:32:58 And at the end, there was one video where he said,
01:33:02 use my audible link.
01:33:03 It makes us a frankly unfair amount of money.
01:33:07 And I was like, oh, like, yeah, if he's
01:33:09 subscribing to unfair, it's got to be he's got to be making like a thousand
01:33:13 dollars a month or something off of it.
01:33:15 You know, he's like a million subscriber channel, I want to say.
01:33:17 So yeah, yeah, it's got to be a lot of money.
01:33:22 That's dope as fuck.
01:33:23 Well, I don't know.
01:33:23 We exhausted a shit.
01:33:24 I have been.
01:33:25 It was like, I have to say about this conversation for quite a while now.
01:33:31 It's great. Everyone should do it. I don't know.
01:33:34 Oh, you know, I do.
01:33:34 I do have one more point I want to make about it.
01:33:36 And it's just that and it's pretty much just a summation of what we've
01:33:40 been saying up to this point.
01:33:41 It's just you shouldn't view people like tailoring their content
01:33:46 to to attract larger audiences as like inherently a selling out sort of thing
01:33:51 because no, like you're there's always going to be an artistic process
01:33:55 involved when you're making something.
01:33:56 And there is a line that you can cross, which John Tron class long ago.
01:34:00 I just want if you don't cross that line, then you're all good.
01:34:03 You should be. It's all great.
01:34:04 My my go ahead.
01:34:07 Yeah, my opinion on like tailoring content to what will get seen.
01:34:13 As far as I'm concerned, my videos don't actually exist until somebody watches them.
01:34:18 You know, sure. Yeah, like that that is when they actually start to matter.
01:34:23 So to me, the idea of, you know,
01:34:27 making stuff in a way that will try to get people to see it
01:34:32 is inherently part of the process of actually making the video.
01:34:36 Yeah, because like if I just make a video and I put it out and like 100 people see it,
01:34:42 like, yeah, it it's it's cool and that's good.
01:34:46 And I applaud people who do that.
01:34:49 But to me, part of the reason that I do it in the first place
01:34:53 is because I I I'm one of those crazy people who actually likes to hear
01:34:57 what people have to say about what I've had to say.
01:35:00 So I read comments, which is not a terrible idea.
01:35:04 I accept compliments, but I don't give a shit what people actually think about it.
01:35:09 Yeah, well, to an extent, I mean, I I'm already right all the time.
01:35:14 So what do these people have to offer to the conversation?
01:35:15 I was just checking through my YouTube messages to see examples of spam I've gotten from companies.
01:35:22 And somebody, yeah, somebody.
01:35:25 That's all the messaging system is used for, really.
01:35:28 Like somebody like the occasionally like occasionally some fan
01:35:31 who's telling you that you're the greatest thing in their entire life.
01:35:34 And then like nothing but like MCM spam and MCM spam.
01:35:39 Like I've got a lot of that.
01:35:40 But yeah, no, I found a thing where somebody made a video reply to one
01:35:45 of my sort of online video, which I will take a look at.
01:35:53 But yeah, like I do like seeing people who have different opinions to me.
01:35:59 And I like getting more comments.
01:36:01 And that's a big part of why I went to YouTube from text blogging,
01:36:04 because I get no fucking comments on any of the game reviews that I wrote
01:36:09 because nobody reads anymore.
01:36:10 Readings for fags.
01:36:11 Yeah, nobody reads.
01:36:13 Yeah, yeah, it's essentially the trajectory I had.
01:36:15 I think I was I feel like I started talking about this earlier and I got sidetracked somehow.
01:36:20 But like, you know, and I made this video called Invitational Art.
01:36:24 It's a vlog on my Digibro of the Dark channel that talks a lot about this,
01:36:28 how there's there's sort of like boogie art and pop art,
01:36:31 where pop art is something that's trying to appeal to everybody.
01:36:34 And boogie art is just trying to appeal to yourself,
01:36:37 just stuff you made just basically for you without too much concern.
01:36:40 And boogie pop is what like bridges the medium.
01:36:44 That's what the ideal.
01:36:45 That's what the concept was of the boogie pop novels,
01:36:47 was that it was the author trying to after years of not getting published
01:36:51 because everything he wrote was too weird.
01:36:52 He tried to make something that was weird, but had just enough pop appeal
01:36:56 to succeed and it did.
01:36:57 And like that, for me, has always been like a great thing
01:37:02 because to put it simply, if you don't,
01:37:06 if you think that selling out is a problem,
01:37:08 don't post your fucking shit anywhere because there's no reason to.
01:37:11 If you just want to make stuff that's just for you, that's fine.
01:37:14 You could probably make a fucking masterpiece that no one will ever understand.
01:37:18 But the second you put it out there,
01:37:20 you're saying that you care what other people think.
01:37:22 You care that other people see it.
01:37:24 And if you want other people to care about it,
01:37:26 then you have to, on some level, make a compromise and invite them in, you know?
01:37:31 So like you're it's a it's a give and take.
01:37:33 Now, you you don't have to compromise all the way.
01:37:36 You can be like Jesse, who makes videos that are primarily for himself
01:37:40 and mostly for himself, but he likes it when people do get it.
01:37:44 And, you know, and he is actually able to make a living
01:37:47 off of the few people who get it because they get it so hard
01:37:50 that they really want to support it.
01:37:52 Whereas, like for me, a big part of the appeal of making videos
01:37:56 is like, how big can I get?
01:37:59 How how can I how much can I
01:38:02 Coto to what the masses want without making something I wouldn't want to make?
01:38:07 You know, I'm sorry.
01:38:07 How did you pronounce Coutou just now? Coutou, you know what I mean?
01:38:11 Jesus Christ. OK.
01:38:13 But like there's there's there's channels out there.
01:38:16 Let's say you get to a discussion.
01:38:19 There's channels out there like this, you know, barely speaks fucking English.
01:38:24 I've said it before.
01:38:25 What makes you think I want to speak English?
01:38:28 Yeah, yeah, fuck you about you fucker.
01:38:31 We got to get a boot.
01:38:32 Anyways, that's Scottish.
01:38:35 You know, as Canada, Christ, I say about about.
01:38:38 That's not a boot.
01:38:40 If anything, it sounds like a boat.
01:38:42 A boat is the fuck.
01:38:44 Go back to the ground.
01:38:47 I don't remember what I was saying anymore.
01:38:49 Yeah, I just I couldn't.
01:38:50 I could never do like, you know, Misty Kronexia level of like and and don't get me wrong.
01:38:55 I don't think that guy is like just doing it for hits.
01:38:57 I think he legitimately likes making that kind of video.
01:39:00 And that's just the kind of guy he is.
01:39:02 And it just happens to be as popular as maybe you couldn't make as much of that
01:39:06 as he makes if you didn't enjoy.
01:39:08 I will say, though, that glass reflections like and I just heard this here say second hand.
01:39:15 But like I was saying how I once criticized him as his videos are like
01:39:20 if you took every like mal review and Reddit comment and just like
01:39:24 constructed them into a video of like whatever the most common opinions
01:39:28 that people has are, you'd get his videos, right?
01:39:30 Like it's like he he somehow manages to reflect the like the lowest
01:39:34 common denominator opinion of a show.
01:39:37 And I was told are you saying that I mean is wrong.
01:39:41 Are you are you having a double standard here?
01:39:43 Are you saying his opinion is wrong?
01:39:44 Are you saying he's wrong?
01:39:46 I don't know.
01:39:47 I don't know what you're talking about.
01:39:49 He's saying his opinions, not his opinion.
01:39:51 Are you?
01:39:51 Yeah, I'm saying that I I've been told that he's doing that on purpose,
01:39:56 that he deliberately tries to have the most what he thinks people want to hear
01:40:02 review. I don't know how true that is, but that's also how it feels.
01:40:06 And whether he's doing it on purpose or not, that is what the what the result is.
01:40:10 It's it's always the most like this is what you would expect everyone to say.
01:40:15 And that's why he's so agreeable and why people why he's like the biggest guy
01:40:20 because he writes the most agreeable videos.
01:40:22 And I could never do that.
01:40:23 I could never try to like meter out what I think people want to hear.
01:40:27 And it's not a good idea to anyways, because appealing to one extreme
01:40:31 or the other is is even more of a way to get attention.
01:40:35 Like if I make that video about a race, like if I had just made a video
01:40:38 that was like, here's what everyone thinks about a race.
01:40:40 Yeah, that would get a lot of attention if I was a big channel,
01:40:43 like, you know, Glass Reflections, but having an extreme opinion means
01:40:48 that while one sector is really pissed off, the other sector thinks
01:40:51 it's the best possible video about a race and they they worship it, you know.
01:40:55 So like same with Sword Art Online, that's why that video.
01:40:58 So those videos are so popular because the sect who hates it loves those
01:41:02 really hate it. Yeah.
01:41:04 Right. Like, I mean, I've got I've gotten the same benefit from Sword Art Online.
01:41:08 I'm trying to see if I can get the same benefit out of hating Uncharted
01:41:14 so far. We'll see. Going OK.
01:41:16 It's my it's like my I think too many people love Uncharted.
01:41:20 Well, yeah, but there's there's people who don't.
01:41:22 A lot of people really loved Bioshock Infinite
01:41:25 and a lot of people continue to really love Bioshock Infinite.
01:41:28 But for some people, the Matthew Matosis video is the most cathartic thing
01:41:31 in the world, right? And yeah, that's true.
01:41:35 Yeah, this is my fastest hit getting
01:41:39 video game video of all time.
01:41:40 And I'm not sure how much of that is down to me having gained
01:41:43 40,000 subscribers since I last made probably a little bit of a video about.
01:41:49 Well, actually, no, I made my hitman video.
01:41:51 I think after I started my big climate subs.
01:41:54 Oh, no, I made it right.
01:41:55 Yeah. Now, you know, I had gotten like
01:41:58 not to hold on.
01:41:59 There is one thing I definitely got to say about because we've talked all about
01:42:03 talked about personal satisfaction with your work,
01:42:06 monetary success with your work.
01:42:08 But then there's also fame and acclaim.
01:42:10 We haven't really talked about that yet.
01:42:12 One thing you guys got to know is because I think a lot of people
01:42:15 like there's a lot of great YouTube content creators who have over a million subs.
01:42:20 But I don't think there's any.
01:42:21 I don't know of any great YouTubers who have 10 million subs, right?
01:42:25 I think that tier is.
01:42:27 Oh, really? OK.
01:42:28 Well, at least, it's very true.
01:42:30 Who, who? Who, who, who, who, Gib?
01:42:31 Oh, you know what? I agree.
01:42:33 Yeah. Yeah. He's the one exception.
01:42:34 He's the one guy.
01:42:35 There's only like 10 shadows with more than 10 million.
01:42:38 But still, the thing is, well, here's the thing, though.
01:42:40 Right? Are you are you saying that Taylor Swift Vivo is
01:42:44 not a killer?
01:42:46 Is going to play play, play, play, play.
01:42:49 Because in regard to the subject.
01:42:51 OK, I heard that in a story.
01:42:52 In regard to the subject.
01:42:53 It's on fucking rules.
01:42:54 Everybody doesn't agree that shake out was the greatest artistic masterpiece
01:42:57 of all time is a fucking idiot
01:43:00 Is that's another thing that about that you're gonna use to evaluate your decisions just keep in mind
01:43:04 I just love party music 10 million
01:43:07 Those though the ultimate biggest big big big big people
01:43:11 My ex-man called his new girlfriend. He's like, oh my god devil shut the fuck up
01:43:17 Can we wrap this thing up, please aren't going to be as famous in the future the people who are going to be
01:43:23 Respected and remembered for decades into the future are people like cg3 or us or people like us or people who are
01:43:30 Not quite at that highest level. They're gonna be the people who are seen as like the Star Wars of this era
01:43:35 So if that's what you're going for remember, you don't gotta be the most famous now
01:43:39 Star Wars was the most famous when it came I know
01:43:44 It's not exactly one-to-one parallel, but it's going to be like Blade Runner or something like or the thing
01:43:51 I could have said Van Gogh, yeah
01:43:54 All right, that's it. Yeah
01:43:57 All right now guys Jeff would say as Jeff would say thank you for watching this podcast about
01:44:02 Selling out. It was a good podcast
01:44:06 Why does your Canada spoof sound like the fucking anime snob?
01:44:10 Give him like a
01:44:12 Montréal voice or something. Like I thought I was going for Quebec. I don't I don't fucking
01:44:16 All right, thanks for watching
01:44:21 Everybody
01:44:51 Money
