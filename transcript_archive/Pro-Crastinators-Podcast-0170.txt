00:00:00 Can I intro? Please, go ahead.
00:00:03 What's up everyone on the episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:07 Why'd you hit me? Listen, we all have our sins that we have to atone for, Ben.
00:00:13 We aren't all free of the vices of humanity. We have to be punished.
00:00:18 And in this glorious Wild West saying that this episode takes place,
00:00:22 and yes, that's right, we are in 1986, aka the pure barbarity of man in nature.
00:00:28 I'm able to do whatever I want to you, my wife. God ordains it.
00:00:32 You know, Munchy, I'm glad that it's the end of history, and we've scientifically discovered
00:00:37 that all morality derives from religion and that there's no God, and therefore everything is permissible.
00:00:43 It's very liberating.
00:00:45 I agree. We also have Nate.
00:00:50 A friend to all the peoples of the earth, but most especially what is known as the honorary Aryan race, the Japanese.
00:00:57 They're my favorite.
00:00:59 What? Any particular reason? I can't imagine anything that they've done that's worth.
00:01:04 Name one thing done by the Japanese or the Aryans.
00:01:08 I'll tell you what, Ben.
00:01:09 Or the Aryan's effect.
00:01:11 In a supporting role in 2003's smash hit starring Tom Cruise, The Last Samurai,
00:01:17 and gotta say, big hit. Big success. Way to go.
00:01:21 Actually, speaking point for later, you know what the Japanese also did? They did...
00:01:26 That's one piece you're hearing right there. We'll get into that in just a second.
00:01:29 But we also have Meij.
00:01:31 Oh, yeah. I'm back, and this is what I come back to. Okay.
00:01:34 Meij, you've been... You're our prodigal son. You've been gone for...
00:01:38 You're our hell of Troy, Meij.
00:01:40 You're our hell of Troy.
00:01:41 You're our Joan of Arc. You're our Steve Brule.
00:01:46 Where you been?
00:01:48 I've been in Lithuania as I usually do during the summer.
00:01:53 Stuff happened. A lot of stuff. I don't want to talk about it.
00:01:56 But I'm back in the UK now, literally.
00:01:59 She's been running drugs across the border for the cartels.
00:02:03 I've been gone for literally one episode, but I feel like it's been a lifetime
00:02:09 since I've ever talked into a microphone.
00:02:11 I feel like I've aged a century at the time that I've been gone.
00:02:14 Now that I think about it, I'm actually surprised that you're here, Munch.
00:02:17 I was expecting you to be continuously occupied.
00:02:19 Aren't you on a road trip or something?
00:02:22 All secrets will be revealed, but I have one thing to tell you right off the bat.
00:02:27 This is the last PCPM recording in the house that I've spent my entire internet career in.
00:02:35 I'm leaving at 10PM this evening, and I will not come back until Christmas, if even.
00:02:43 If not for summer. This is the end of an era.
00:02:46 It's actually happening. The wheels are in motion, and I'm going to college.
00:02:50 Literally, I'm heading to Boston tonight.
00:02:53 Actually, that's not entirely true. I'm heading to DC and then to Baltimore and then to Boston,
00:02:57 but the idea is there.
00:02:59 Hey, aren't we all getting a bus together?
00:03:03 We are. We're all going to be jammed out.
00:03:05 So after BronyCon, me, Ben, Cassie, and Hippo are all going to run the same Greyhound together,
00:03:11 and it's going to be glorious, and we're going to have the whole place to ourselves,
00:03:13 and we're going to force everyone else out.
00:03:15 We're taking the bus there, too, right, from Boston to Baltimore.
00:03:19 Nah, nah, I'm flying in.
00:03:21 You are?
00:03:22 Yeah.
00:03:23 So I think you're, yeah, as is Gib, I think you guys are just taking the bus out together?
00:03:26 Yes.
00:03:27 Right?
00:03:28 Yeah.
00:03:29 Okay. All right.
00:03:30 So let's just be super clear.
00:03:31 Most of us, not Mage, but the bunch of us are going to be at BronyCon next week,
00:03:35 which might mean that this is one of the super rare occasions when no PCP gets made.
00:03:40 We're not quite sure how that's going to work out, but they're going to make it.
00:03:43 I'm going to go on my own.
00:03:44 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:03:46 Dude, we need like a, it's got to be the PCP, the PCP B-Listers, you know,
00:03:51 all the second-rate characters that nobody likes.
00:03:54 Digi, Jesse, Mage, Davoo.
00:03:57 God, that sounds so much better than us.
00:03:59 Monkey Jones, Jeff.
00:04:01 Monkey Jones, Jeff.
00:04:02 I can't tell you how sick I am of us.
00:04:04 Nino, Econ, the, you know, the gangs all here.
00:04:08 Yeah, yeah.
00:04:09 Ben, why must you increase the sniper red dots on your face to more
00:04:14 than the already astounding 20 that it's at?
00:04:17 Or I guess like 15,000 or whatever the Twitter followers have started on Avocados.
00:04:23 God, well, I want it, I just, I want, I'd like him.
00:04:28 I'm like a little cat.
00:04:29 I like to fucking, I like to paw at them with my little paws.
00:04:34 Ah, curiously killed the cat, they say.
00:04:40 Hey, anyway.
00:04:41 I'm just asking questions.
00:04:42 You were right, Ben.
00:04:43 I was an original.
00:04:44 I know.
00:04:45 And I got back from it.
00:04:46 I went to Chris State.
00:04:48 Originally, the plans were quite-
00:04:50 What is, what is Chris State?
00:04:52 Oh, well, you know, cross the state means you go one way.
00:04:55 Well, Chris goes upwards.
00:04:57 Oh.
00:04:58 Chris crossed them.
00:04:59 Okay, all right.
00:05:00 So I went to Chris State.
00:05:01 You went, you went, you went, you went Chris Country skiing.
00:05:04 Yeah, basically.
00:05:05 Yeah.
00:05:06 And it was great.
00:05:07 And I'll spare the details as a matter, but I went from my hometown of San Diego, my soon
00:05:14 to be ex-wife of San Diego.
00:05:16 You capped any motherfuckers?
00:05:19 I capped a few.
00:05:20 There were many instances.
00:05:22 Oh, one of my friends got scammed by a fake homeless person.
00:05:25 That was cool.
00:05:26 There were many people to cap.
00:05:28 There were many, there were many like, like unfortunate shadowy figures.
00:05:32 I assume you'd be, by that, you mean like TF2, like capture the flag like along the
00:05:36 way, just like capping territories and, you know, that's basically the case.
00:05:40 I mean, basically in between Los Angeles and San Francisco, there's, there's nothing
00:05:45 really of note other than Monterey, which we stopped in, but there's basically nothing
00:05:49 there.
00:05:50 So it was a lot of long driving and the only stop that we had on the second day while
00:05:54 we were going through that long, like five hour stretch of basic nothingness.
00:05:58 There was like a really like shit hard to describe tourist trap, which like, oh God,
00:06:04 it was like, it was, imagine a gift shop for a theme park and the theme park is themed
00:06:10 as the Wild West and it's only the gift shop and it's this really tacky antique shop.
00:06:16 The place is called Bravo Land.
00:06:18 It's called Bravo Land.
00:06:20 Look it up if you can.
00:06:21 Johnny Bravo Land?
00:06:22 Basically, Bravoville, the Bravilians call it, of course.
00:06:27 It's this antique shop, but the only antiques are literal trash.
00:06:33 I'm talking used soda bottles.
00:06:36 That kind of stuff is on display.
00:06:38 Well, some of those are collectibles, I guess.
00:06:40 For $10, you're going to get a used Dr. Pepper from 1980s.
00:06:44 Is that, is that worth $10?
00:06:46 If it's some kind of collectible to some, perhaps, I don't know.
00:06:50 Maybe, I don't know if that's the logic or not.
00:06:52 There were rusty wrenches.
00:06:54 There were like, there were just like logs of wood that you could buy.
00:06:58 Was there an old Nokia in there?
00:07:00 There's what?
00:07:01 An ancient Nokia pose.
00:07:03 No, there was no Nokia, unfortunately.
00:07:05 I would have just snapped that in a second.
00:07:08 That was great.
00:07:09 Here's the only thing I want to talk about about this.
00:07:12 Here's the only thing, is that I had a sequel to something that happened in Rome and something
00:07:19 that I want to talk about on this very podcast.
00:07:21 And that's, I fell back into my old, disgusting ways.
00:07:25 This was the Leaning Tower of Pisa 2.
00:07:29 The San Francisco Chinatown.
00:07:31 The Leaning Tower of Pisa 2, 9-11.
00:07:34 Basically.
00:07:35 Now there's two of them.
00:07:37 Now there's two of them.
00:07:38 Listen, I didn't understand what the big deal was about 9-11,
00:07:41 but now I understand after a personal tragedy has happened to me,
00:07:44 I understand what it must be like to experience pain due to 9-11.
00:07:48 The San Francisco Chinatown.
00:07:49 I understand what it's like to experience pain, period.
00:07:52 It's a fucking nightmare.
00:07:53 The San Francisco Chinatown is a fucking nightmare.
00:07:56 Imagine the most generic tourist shops you can imagine.
00:08:03 Not anything themed towards China.
00:08:06 Just get your key chains here, San Francisco.
00:08:09 Oh, get your fucking giant's caps.
00:08:12 Who buys the generic New York tourist things?
00:08:17 Who buys, like, I love San Francisco.
00:08:20 Or who buys, like, giant shirts?
00:08:22 Like, who does this?
00:08:23 What kind of person to be?
00:08:25 The thing is, like, I actually asked myself that same question when I was in an airport.
00:08:29 And I thought, like, you know, they're marketing to the wrong people.
00:08:32 They're marketing to the tourists.
00:08:34 But, like, I think the people who would buy such things
00:08:37 was probably people living in those places because they have pride in where they live.
00:08:42 So I'm confused.
00:08:43 You can only buy so many pieces of merchandise.
00:08:46 What's the merchandise you live?
00:08:48 What's the merchandise we're talking about?
00:08:50 We're talking about really tacky touristy things that say I love San Francisco
00:08:53 and just have, like, pictures of California on them
00:08:55 and that are just, like, I mean, in every other place.
00:08:57 Well, here's the thing.
00:08:59 The people that live around there, they might buy, like, one shirt to rep for their hometown.
00:09:06 But the tourists, the tourists that want to show, like, how well-traveled they are,
00:09:10 that's a continually refreshing resource.
00:09:12 There's going to be more of those guys every fucking day.
00:09:15 Day!
00:09:16 Indeed.
00:09:17 I guess.
00:09:18 But I would totally buy an I Love Lafainia T-shirt.
00:09:21 Yeah.
00:09:22 Except no one would ever make such a garment under any circumstance.
00:09:26 I want to get, sometimes I think about getting, like,
00:09:29 sometimes I think about getting, like, a map of the Boston T-System, like, tattooed on me.
00:09:33 Dude, oh, okay.
00:09:34 I want to team up so much.
00:09:36 I'm looking at, like, right now I'm looking at a map of Boston that I got.
00:09:41 It's a really, like, cool, like, almost, like, three-dimensional, old-timey map.
00:09:45 And it's sick as hell.
00:09:47 I would totally get, like, Boston merch.
00:09:49 I'm way into that.
00:09:50 Dude, Ben, you remember when we were in the traditional center?
00:09:52 I would get one thing.
00:09:53 When we saw those, like, play toy, like, T-trains that you could, like, buy for, like, your kid?
00:09:59 I want, like, a full set of those.
00:10:01 Look at this, look at this link in the description to the fucking thing that Mae just posted.
00:10:06 Oh, shit!
00:10:07 Lithuania T-shirt.
00:10:08 Pretty sick.
00:10:09 Whoa!
00:10:10 Oh, my God.
00:10:11 Yeah, I want it.
00:10:12 Whoa!
00:10:13 That's, yeah.
00:10:14 That's sick as hell.
00:10:16 Hey, by the way, quick point.
00:10:18 Quick point, because we met new PCB character Grace last week.
00:10:21 My sister, who was on.
00:10:23 My sister.
00:10:24 She's mine, damn.
00:10:25 I'm sorry.
00:10:26 Who are you?
00:10:27 All right.
00:10:28 But the point, I was just, I said to Grace, as I said before, like, the one tattoo, and
00:10:32 speaking of tattoos, that I ever thought of even possibly getting, was, like, the Joe
00:10:38 Star Star on the Joe Star place on my shoulder.
00:10:41 Oh, wow.
00:10:42 And I just said to Grace, because she's a tattoo artist, and I just said to her, like,
00:10:45 Grace, I just, I'm just curious, like, has anyone ever asked you for, like, and I describe
00:10:49 it's on this exact spot, and she's like, like, one week ago, this guy comes into my shop
00:10:54 and gets this exact same tattoo.
00:10:56 And I was like, oh, I just felt the wind rush out of my face.
00:11:00 And you were just like, oh, yeah, yeah.
00:11:02 I mean, I mean, I'm sure you knew that you wouldn't be the only one.
00:11:07 But to have, to have, like, the first tattoo artist my sister, who I talked to, is like,
00:11:11 yes, this is extremely common.
00:11:13 You're a basic bitch.
00:11:14 You're not cool, Nate.
00:11:15 You're not interesting.
00:11:16 Your idea sucks.
00:11:17 I mean, come on.
00:11:18 You're talking about, like, a popular anime, right?
00:11:21 Like, a mark on a character's body.
00:11:24 A mark on a character's body.
00:11:25 Populars it is now.
00:11:26 God damn it.
00:11:27 I read the manga.
00:11:28 Which anime?
00:11:29 What anime?
00:11:30 Joe Joe's Bizarre Adventure.
00:11:32 Maybe you've heard of it, Mage.
00:11:35 Yeah, okay.
00:11:36 Yeah, Joe Joe.
00:11:37 Yes.
00:11:38 Ah, whatever.
00:11:39 Okay, sorry, sorry.
00:11:40 Anyway, Munchy, finish your tale, please.
00:11:42 So Chinatown sucked, and it just was all that.
00:11:44 Right, right.
00:11:45 Also, a bizarre genre of store.
00:11:47 I don't even know how to describe it.
00:11:49 Like, money laundering ridden all over it.
00:11:52 It just is a marble statue store with no cash register and no one manning it.
00:11:57 Imagine you're on, like, a popular street, so just Chinatown.
00:12:00 You turn into a store, it's full of, like, bronze and marble statues,
00:12:05 and no one's inside of it.
00:12:07 I guess someone's gonna make those.
00:12:08 That is weird.
00:12:09 Oh my God, Mage, that's the coolest piece of merch.
00:12:12 Look at this fucking Lithuania basketball.
00:12:14 Is the world exploding?
00:12:16 No, it's being dunked.
00:12:18 It's being dunked.
00:12:19 This is like the Lithuania, like, actual Olympics basketball team jersey.
00:12:23 Look at these skeletons.
00:12:24 Oh, I love it.
00:12:26 Oh, the skull dots.
00:12:27 Holy shit.
00:12:29 That's crazy.
00:12:30 Did these represent Lithuania in some way?
00:12:32 Are skeletons integral to, like, the lore?
00:12:34 Or is it the origin story?
00:12:36 Basketball is like the second religion of Lithuania.
00:12:39 Are you serious?
00:12:41 They were one of Lithuania's original settlers, the skeletons, who played basketball.
00:12:45 I had no idea.
00:12:47 This second one was just the skeletons playing basketball.
00:12:50 This is like some big dog shit.
00:12:53 I think it's a variation of an original design in 1998 or something.
00:12:58 I'm not sure, but this is like the original.
00:13:01 It was really popular at that time, and people are bringing back it.
00:13:05 This is incredible.
00:13:06 Ridiculous.
00:13:07 I didn't...
00:13:08 I didn't...
00:13:09 Is it all...
00:13:10 Is that...
00:13:11 That's so weird.
00:13:12 I didn't know there were any European countries that gave a shit about basketball.
00:13:15 Yeah, I mean...
00:13:17 I wouldn't imagine.
00:13:18 I guess Lithuania...
00:13:20 Mage, you're known to be quite tall.
00:13:22 Are Lithuanians tall?
00:13:23 Is that why they play basketball?
00:13:25 I don't know.
00:13:27 I was pretty tall in comparison, but the guys were taller than me once they hit puberty,
00:13:34 so I guess we're kind of tall on average.
00:13:37 And we were pretty good too.
00:13:39 I see.
00:13:40 People who play basketball in Lithuania.
00:13:42 Yeah, I suppose there's probably some Norse genes going on.
00:13:45 They're Viking blood and whatnot.
00:13:47 They didn't even know to dunk.
00:13:49 I found out.
00:13:50 I learned a term.
00:13:53 I learned a historical term.
00:13:55 Fuck.
00:13:56 Lithuania is in the region called the Balkans, right?
00:13:58 No.
00:13:59 Baltics.
00:14:00 Baltics.
00:14:01 Fuck.
00:14:02 I always confuse those two.
00:14:03 Okay, nevermind.
00:14:04 Baltic is the sea.
00:14:05 Yeah, okay.
00:14:06 I see.
00:14:07 Balkans is the World War I.
00:14:09 I learned what the word balkanize means.
00:14:11 I think I'm thinking of...
00:14:13 It's like a...
00:14:14 Down in like a Middle Eastern, like Russian, like Turkey kind of region.
00:14:19 Balkanize a region means to divide it into mutually hostile states.
00:14:25 Huh, okay.
00:14:26 Yes, so that's something you don't want to happen.
00:14:28 Oh, like they did with India and Pakistan back in the day, right?
00:14:32 That's...
00:14:33 I guess so.
00:14:34 Okay.
00:14:35 And like, I think this is what happened to a lot of the former USSR.
00:14:39 You know what I'm saying?
00:14:40 Yeah, all right.
00:14:41 You go to Slavia.
00:14:42 I learned this.
00:14:43 I heard this word thrown around and now I know what it means and I feel intelligent.
00:14:46 Good job, man.
00:14:47 My IQ points.
00:14:48 I gained two IQ points.
00:14:49 Yeah, the Balkans, I'm pretty sure they're like in the southern part of your...
00:14:54 Let me see.
00:14:55 They are.
00:14:56 They're just north of Greece.
00:14:58 Looks like the Balkans are...
00:15:00 South of...
00:15:01 Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo, Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Romania.
00:15:07 Enough with the fucking geography lesson.
00:15:09 I'm sorry.
00:15:10 Let's get back to the epic meme story.
00:15:12 All right.
00:15:13 Okay.
00:15:14 Meme away, my friend.
00:15:15 We're actually learning something for once.
00:15:17 I hate learning and I love losing information.
00:15:19 Oh, and Montenegro.
00:15:20 Take it away.
00:15:21 I forgot Montenegro.
00:15:22 I forgot Montenegro.
00:15:23 Everyone's favorite.
00:15:24 I start dancing for Nate's amusement.
00:15:27 That's right.
00:15:28 Tippity tap, tippity tap.
00:15:30 Cool.
00:15:31 Excellent.
00:15:32 Hey, by the way, as I said before, I'm leaving this house and I've built up such like a genuine
00:15:42 friendship with the people that staff my Chipotle.
00:15:47 They know me by name, by order.
00:15:50 I walked in to my Chipotle, my last visit and it seems like everyone was on staff.
00:15:59 There were like 20 people in the kitchen and that line for some bizarre reason.
00:16:03 It's like a small store and everyone like jumped up and said like, hey, double-stake
00:16:09 queso, double-stake quesos here.
00:16:11 I took my order.
00:16:12 They said, oh, like, oh, you're going to leave.
00:16:14 Oh, you guys, you got to come back.
00:16:16 Wait, wait, wait.
00:16:17 They call you double-stake queso?
00:16:18 They call me double-stake queso.
00:16:21 Like when I said that it was my last day, like everyone was like upset and sad.
00:16:26 They gave me my meal for free.
00:16:27 They said, like, come back as soon as you can.
00:16:29 Is that true?
00:16:30 Did they really do that?
00:16:31 No, no, I'm serious.
00:16:32 I'm 100% dead serious, Nate.
00:16:33 Hey, that's crazy.
00:16:34 I have an absolute kinship with Chipotle, with the Chipotle staff at my local venue.
00:16:39 And it's great.
00:16:40 The only family I've ever known is the only time I've really felt loved by another group
00:16:44 of people.
00:16:45 It's great.
00:16:46 Like, just like walking and having new people you've never talked to be like, hey, wait
00:16:50 a second, are you the double-stake queso guy?
00:16:53 I'm like, yeah, I am.
00:16:54 I am a double-stake queso guy.
00:16:55 Hey, hey, everyone, check it out.
00:16:58 It's that double-stake queso guy.
00:17:00 Literally, that's happened, man.
00:17:01 That's literally happened.
00:17:02 Like, oh, hey, guys.
00:17:03 It's double-stake queso.
00:17:04 He's here.
00:17:05 What a weird quirky order, double-stake and queso.
00:17:09 Are you kidding me?
00:17:10 Wait, I genuinely don't feel the audacity.
00:17:15 Why are you double-stake queso?
00:17:17 Because the frequency of my visits is because I'm such a regular.
00:17:22 They know me by heart.
00:17:23 They know my order by heart.
00:17:24 Because in fact, the order itself is significant.
00:17:26 The fact that it happens like every day.
00:17:29 Chipotle shares your cultural and genetic background, an ungodly mix of the white man
00:17:33 and the red man, and out comes double-stake queso onto God's green earth, offending us
00:17:40 all with his presence.
00:17:41 Anyway, that's what I call my dick.
00:17:42 But delighting us as well.
00:17:44 Gross.
00:17:45 Delighting our humor.
00:17:46 Our four humors.
00:17:47 I'll miss them so.
00:17:49 I'll miss them from the bottom of my heart.
00:17:52 The Chipotle's in the east coast are terrible.
00:17:55 They're abjectly terrible and are disgusting.
00:17:59 They're like...
00:18:00 No base for comparison.
00:18:01 They're so bad.
00:18:02 Yeah, I'll believe that.
00:18:03 I'll believe that.
00:18:04 West Coast Chipotle's are the way to go.
00:18:05 And I'm going to miss them.
00:18:06 The only family I've ever known that's upsetting.
00:18:10 Well, that's the end of that chapter, I guess.
00:18:14 Welcome to the east coast.
00:18:16 Well, I'll come back.
00:18:17 I'll get off the plane, I'll rush back into my Chipotle, and then I'll go to the grounds
00:18:22 where the Chipotle once stood.
00:18:23 And it's going to be like the dystopian wasteland from the end of Joe's garage.
00:18:26 Music is going to be outlawed.
00:18:27 Chipotle's going to be outlawed.
00:18:28 I'm going to have to eat a Chipotle burrito in my imagination because there's no more
00:18:33 burritos to be eaten.
00:18:34 It's going to be like a barren, like it's going to be like a junkyard.
00:18:37 It's going to be just like death and decay all around me and just brown, rusting pipes
00:18:41 where the Chipotle once stood.
00:18:43 And I'm going to beg God, I'm going to drop down my knee and start bawling.
00:18:46 I'm going to ask God for a burrito.
00:18:47 And it's going to be like, hey, is that double steak queso guy?
00:18:50 Hey, Jesus, go right, it's double steak queso guy.
00:18:53 Uh, sad.
00:18:54 I know, literally.
00:18:55 Ben, you were looking really rowdy on Twitter yesterday.
00:19:00 Uh, yeah, my hair was supposed to be purple, but it ended up pink.
00:19:07 Okay.
00:19:08 Yes, I have pink hair now.
00:19:09 Um, the, the, I kind of don't want to make it purple though, because when it's like
00:19:13 dark, it's like, kind of looks like it's not, like it looks like you kind of, you can't
00:19:18 even tell that it's purple unless you sort of look at it like in the right lighting.
00:19:23 And that means yourself, or did you go to like, uh, I did, I did it myself.
00:19:28 I did it myself.
00:19:29 Okay.
00:19:30 Maybe, maybe you had a professional do it.
00:19:31 Maybe it would look good.
00:19:32 Uh, well, I'm not going to fucking do that.
00:19:35 You kidding me?
00:19:36 Well, do I, what do I look like I'm fucking Mr. fucking money bags over here?
00:19:41 All right.
00:19:42 Uh, uh, when it looks, well, it's purple, it looks like an accident, so I might just
00:19:46 keep it pink.
00:19:47 I don't know.
00:19:48 You know, that's, that's fair.
00:19:49 But I mean, we have to address the elephant in the room that, that killer morale has never
00:19:53 been lower.
00:19:54 It has never been lower than right now.
00:19:56 No, no, no, it's not the image.
00:19:58 It's kind of pinkish purple.
00:19:59 It's like a symbol.
00:20:00 Maybe it's the symbol of unity.
00:20:01 No, that's a lie.
00:20:02 That's not.
00:20:03 Don't blow me on that.
00:20:04 It's the symbol of unity.
00:20:05 No unity.
00:20:06 So there is an unnamed, if you were to look at the chat, there's an unnamed individual
00:20:10 and I won't name any names.
00:20:12 He has pink hair.
00:20:14 He is looking at the camera aggressively.
00:20:17 He is breaking the law as vandalized a, a fire hydrant by posting a sticker claiming
00:20:24 that his heinous act of vaping is not a crime and he's wearing the smoking gun.
00:20:28 He's wearing a rowdy pride shirt.
00:20:30 Tell me.
00:20:31 That's not right.
00:20:32 It's a pajama pants on with Japanese kanji plastered all over it.
00:20:37 He's crouching in the middle of a darkly-lit suburb.
00:20:40 It's shiny as you raise this.
00:20:41 That's literally rowdy.
00:20:43 Tell me it's not right.
00:20:44 How's it not rowdy?
00:20:45 Ben, tell me how it's not rowdy.
00:20:46 Tell me how.
00:20:47 Tell me how.
00:20:48 Okay.
00:20:49 Well, he's wearing this shirt.
00:20:50 Shut the fuck up.
00:20:51 You piece of shit.
00:20:52 He's wearing this shirt ironically and he didn't put that sticker there.
00:20:53 He found that sticker there.
00:20:54 Someone else had put it there and he, he felt a sense of camaraderie and he had to express
00:20:57 it.
00:20:58 This is the most rowdy image I've ever seen in my time.
00:21:00 That's my read.
00:21:01 This is my personal image.
00:21:02 I can see it in his eyes.
00:21:03 Listen, photographs are all about cultivation.
00:21:06 They're all about exclusion.
00:21:07 There he is.
00:21:08 Maze posted it.
00:21:09 Maze found it.
00:21:10 Ben, okay, so what has made you want to be a total fucking faggot?
00:21:17 A total fucking asshole.
00:21:19 Yeah.
00:21:20 I just, I thought it'd be funny.
00:21:25 Will the descent ever stop?
00:21:27 No.
00:21:28 Into madness.
00:21:29 I just, I'm uncovering new depths.
00:21:30 I'm uncovering new depths to sink to every single day.
00:21:34 Okay.
00:21:35 Wow.
00:21:36 This re-encouraging.
00:21:37 If I remember correctly, I think Ben has described wanting to do things of this nature
00:21:42 for a while.
00:21:43 Of course.
00:21:44 I wanted to, I wanted to do like a purple hair and killer thing, cop killer thing.
00:21:47 Right, right.
00:21:48 And then I ended up liking how the pink looked better.
00:21:50 It doesn't mean anything.
00:21:51 Yeah.
00:21:52 We'll see.
00:21:53 This is gonna be just a fucking killer piece of propaganda and the fact that you're not
00:21:58 denying it more vehemently and not rejecting it.
00:22:01 I did it purple and it was like, it's too dark.
00:22:03 I don't like how it looks.
00:22:04 Oh, it's too dark.
00:22:05 Did you hear that?
00:22:06 It's too dark.
00:22:07 I put more bleach in it thinking it would become a lighter purple, but it ended up,
00:22:12 but it ended up pink instead, like pink and purple swirl, like a fucking, like a cotton
00:22:16 candy swirl.
00:22:17 It reminds me too much.
00:22:18 It reminds me too much of, hey, hey, I don't like your girlfriend, reminds me too much
00:22:22 of that shitty pop singer.
00:22:23 I'm gonna go thrash, ladies and gentlemen.
00:22:26 I'll see you later.
00:22:27 I'm really a quote from Ben right now.
00:22:29 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, get my fucking lawyers on the case.
00:22:33 Yeah, I will.
00:22:34 I'll kill them before you're able to call them.
00:22:36 Listen, have my people call your people and let them know that I'm supposed to be suing
00:22:40 you right now.
00:22:41 All right.
00:22:42 All right.
00:22:43 I'll have my people call your people and give them death threats over the internet.
00:22:45 We'll settle this.
00:22:46 We'll settle this on the court, on the basketball court, on the Lithuanian skeleton basketball
00:22:52 court.
00:22:53 Nate, I'm sure you know, you know about that Japanese lawyer that was so hardcore doxxed
00:22:57 and it was like a whole like needy of frenzy for a while?
00:23:01 I'm not sure.
00:23:02 No, I don't think I know what you're talking about.
00:23:04 His name escapes me.
00:23:05 I think it's Karasawa, I believe.
00:23:08 Anyway, it was a funny event in Japanese history.
00:23:12 Japanese internet goers are like the scariest fucking group of people, like basically like
00:23:17 ever.
00:23:18 I feel like if you were to offend like the Japanese like two-channel audience, like your
00:23:23 life could just be like over and like an instant.
00:23:27 So there's this Japanese lawyer who like, I don't know, was trying to defend some anon
00:23:31 on two-channel who was made fun of.
00:23:33 Anyway, he got so hardcore doxxed that people would go to his house every single day.
00:23:37 People were making like art of him and posting it everywhere in the city.
00:23:40 It was this whole like giant like media frenzy and it was crazy and Karasawa, here let me
00:23:48 see.
00:23:49 Let me see if I can find it.
00:23:50 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:23:51 Karasaki, here.
00:23:53 One second.
00:23:54 I will post in just a moment.
00:23:57 But it's crazy that people are able to just like completely shut down like a person's
00:24:06 career.
00:24:07 God damn it.
00:24:08 Where is it?
00:24:09 Hold on.
00:24:10 I'm not fully following the story here.
00:24:11 Yeah, I need more information.
00:24:12 Me either, yeah, yeah.
00:24:13 What happened?
00:24:14 Who?
00:24:15 Where?
00:24:16 When?
00:24:17 Okay.
00:24:18 Some random douche was being bullied online.
00:24:21 He calls a lawyer.
00:24:23 Okay.
00:24:24 Yeah.
00:24:25 He calls a lawyer and the lawyer is like, hey, I'm going to sue two-channel and he posts
00:24:32 it on the web, on the forum.
00:24:35 Because he got bullied there?
00:24:36 No, yeah.
00:24:37 Well, not the person himself like he calls a lawyer and the lawyer steps in and posts
00:24:42 on two-channel.
00:24:43 Okay.
00:24:44 Okay.
00:24:45 And then.
00:24:46 That's really funny.
00:24:48 The lawyer's identity is discovered.
00:24:51 And then people go on a trolling spree and docks the lawyer and the client, of course,
00:24:59 and just like makes a ton of art to ruin the reputation.
00:25:04 And it's a big, funny meme here at Google.
00:25:06 Okay.
00:25:07 I was not there.
00:25:08 I mean, the lawyer was just doing his job.
00:25:10 I mean, you know, okay, but didn't he do a stupid thing?
00:25:14 Didn't he do a stupid thing by saying he was going to sue two-channel?
00:25:17 Yeah.
00:25:18 Like, isn't that being bad at his job?
00:25:21 I mean, that's, look, a lawyer's job is not to know ahead of time if they're going to
00:25:26 necessarily win or lose any given case.
00:25:29 And like, I don't know, lawyers just do things that they think they have a chance of succeeding
00:25:34 at legally.
00:25:35 I don't know.
00:25:36 I don't have the same kind of, I don't know, animosity towards lawyers doing shit.
00:25:39 They're just trying to see what they can get away with according to the law.
00:25:42 I get being annoyed at like all the law shit, but, you know.
00:25:45 But it seems like, I mean, it seems like his goal was to take down two-channel, which is,
00:25:49 and it's really stupid.
00:25:51 So I can see why they would be like, they're defensive of their site.
00:25:54 And also they're like, look at this, look at this fucking clown thinking he can sue two-channel
00:25:59 over this.
00:26:00 I mean, what I would have, if it was me, I mean, you know, this is me, but I would have
00:26:03 allowed him to attempt this and then just fail because there's no grounds for this.
00:26:06 Well, I mean, they, well, they didn't stop him from doing it.
00:26:09 But they did, it sounds like they did far worse than that.
00:26:12 What exactly did they do?
00:26:13 What exactly did they do to destroy him?
00:26:15 So like, they defaced a family shrine of like a tomb of his family.
00:26:21 That's fucked up, man.
00:26:22 That's just illegal.
00:26:25 And they stalked him constantly, like they sent drones to his house to try and observe
00:26:29 him in old times and like constantly rang, like went to his house and tried to like talk
00:26:34 to him, like did like funny like worship of him, made him really uncomfortable.
00:26:40 And they posted like, like, like bizarre photos of him, like everywhere around the city, like
00:26:45 on like, like, like train stations and stuff like that.
00:26:48 They tried to make him famous.
00:26:49 Yeah.
00:26:50 It was a good old time.
00:26:51 No, that's a little too far.
00:26:52 I mean, like making fun of him online for being a dumb.
00:26:55 It's, it's quite excessive on, and you know, I mean, I don't know, people are silly about
00:27:00 it, but like, even when you do things by the letter of the law, it can still be morally
00:27:04 wrong and like not a cool thing to do, you know, sounds like some of the things they
00:27:09 did were illegal.
00:27:10 Other things.
00:27:11 I don't know.
00:27:12 I get it.
00:27:13 They're defensive of the site.
00:27:14 They don't give a fuck.
00:27:15 A lot of people on 4chan and 2chan or whatever are very nihilist minded.
00:27:17 Fair.
00:27:18 I understand.
00:27:19 You could expect these sort of things.
00:27:20 And lol, it's funny that bad things happen to them as a consequence.
00:27:22 I'm with you.
00:27:23 I'm with you.
00:27:24 I mean, I wouldn't want a fucking family shrine to face.
00:27:27 Yeah.
00:27:28 Yeah.
00:27:29 Yeah.
00:27:30 But you mess with the bull, you get the testicles.
00:27:33 I guess.
00:27:34 It would have been okay if they just sort of made fun of him, but then doxing him and
00:27:38 stalking him and then the shrine thing, that's a little too much.
00:27:41 Well, I mean, I mean, of course, yeah.
00:27:43 Well, did they dox him?
00:27:44 I mean, he must have doxed himself if they found out who he was.
00:27:47 Well, he probably was like, hi, I'm this lawyer and I'm fucking gunna sue you or whatever.
00:27:53 Well, yeah, but his home address was not publicly known.
00:27:57 Well, I mean, it sounds like I have, I bet it was publicly available.
00:28:02 Like if he knew his family shrine was to though and include that information in his post, I
00:28:07 mean, probably not, right?
00:28:08 Probably not.
00:28:09 No, probably not.
00:28:10 Well, okay.
00:28:11 Nonetheless, we don't know the details.
00:28:13 Who knows exactly how bad or good it was, but very funny.
00:28:17 I'm going to go with 100% good.
00:28:19 Yeah.
00:28:20 I think that's the default state that everyone should go to for any event.
00:28:25 You know, just assume that it was a blanket positive.
00:28:28 Since all morality derives from religion and we've proven that God is fake, I'm going
00:28:34 to call this 100% good thing that happens.
00:28:37 What does this mean?
00:28:38 What is this new like line that you're parroting then?
00:28:41 What did thought slime say that once and now it's the new thing you're saying?
00:28:46 Yeah, he said it and I was like, wait a minute, wait a minute, there's no God.
00:28:51 I can do anything I want to do.
00:28:53 And then I started smoking weed and now I'm a libertarian.
00:28:57 Wow, that's a great story.
00:28:59 It's just that easy, folks.
00:29:01 It's just that easy.
00:29:02 You know, you never know.
00:29:03 And a little things going to come along when you're going to take a bite and change your
00:29:07 life.
00:29:08 You know, speaking of all this Japanese defacing of family graves and whatnot, I got to tell
00:29:15 you, the last samurai global box office smash hit from 2003 starring Tom Cruise is a real
00:29:22 roller coaster ride.
00:29:23 Ladies and gentlemen, I highly recommend.
00:29:25 Boy, this is a fucking timely review.
00:29:29 Yeah.
00:29:30 Just in time.
00:29:31 I was just thinking about should I watch last samurai?
00:29:34 I mean, I'm talking about I'm talking about a hundred and forty million budget of four
00:29:38 hundred and fifty eight point eight million dollar box office intake.
00:29:43 Just just excellent work, everybody.
00:29:45 Warner Brothers pictures are really knocked out of the park.
00:29:47 Fantastic.
00:29:48 I can't watch a nobby commanding performance.
00:29:51 This could be a big break for for this up and coming young star Tom Cruise.
00:29:57 I hope to see more of him.
00:29:59 Hope to see more of him in the future.
00:30:01 I hope he boxes Justin Bieber and that that happens.
00:30:04 Did that happen?
00:30:05 Pretty cool.
00:30:06 Justin Bieber tweeted that he wants to in the style of these YouTubers who have been doing
00:30:11 fights for entertainment, he wants to fight Tom Cruise, you know, in the ring.
00:30:17 Because Tom Cruise is like 70.
00:30:19 Yeah.
00:30:20 Yeah, recently.
00:30:21 I mean, I think Tom Cruise would kick his ass personally, but you know, what do I know?
00:30:24 I don't know.
00:30:25 He's like a hundred years old.
00:30:27 Let's see how old Tom Cruise is.
00:30:28 Just for fun.
00:30:29 He's got the church on the side, dude.
00:30:31 He's got Scientologists.
00:30:32 He's going to drink like some like secret potion.
00:30:34 He's going to become the whole.
00:30:36 He's at least 60.
00:30:37 Tom Cruise is 57.
00:30:38 Tom Cruise is 57.
00:30:39 Oh, wow.
00:30:40 Okay.
00:30:41 And Justin Bieber is probably like 25.
00:30:42 So like prime of his life, obviously.
00:30:44 I still got to put it on Tommy.
00:30:46 I think Tom would have some.
00:30:48 I mean, they're both.
00:30:49 They're both.
00:30:50 They're both manlets.
00:30:51 They're both manlets.
00:30:52 They're both manlets.
00:30:53 Absolutely true.
00:30:54 He's going to get some like 11 year olds to like a bath and some sort of like spirit
00:30:59 cooking pot event.
00:31:00 He's going to drink.
00:31:01 He's going to drink some of their essence.
00:31:03 And then he's going to grow tin sizes and become a literal God and destroy.
00:31:08 Ken Watanabe literally surgically implanted the spirit of the samurai into Tom Cruise
00:31:13 during 2003.
00:31:14 Smash it.
00:31:15 The last samurai wet, which can I can I just remind got over 300 million dollars in
00:31:21 profits at the box office.
00:31:22 Just incredible work, everybody.
00:31:24 Got to give it to a Han Zimmer for that score.
00:31:27 Read our pictures.
00:31:28 The Bedford Falls Company.
00:31:29 Cruise Wagner Productions.
00:31:30 Everybody just did such a fantastic job.
00:31:33 This is my timely review.
00:31:35 The last samurai.
00:31:37 Good work, everybody.
00:31:38 I was going to say, speaking of Thought Slime, everyone's on the Thought Slime train now.
00:31:42 Hippos on it.
00:31:43 Jesse's on it.
00:31:44 Everyone.
00:31:45 Soon we're all going to be.
00:31:46 I'm going to convert the whole piece.
00:31:47 That's the entirety of the world right there.
00:31:48 I'm going to convert the whole PCP to a narco communism.
00:31:51 OK, but my contrarian nature does not allow this.
00:31:53 I will not consume any Thought Slimes.
00:31:56 Well, I'm sorry.
00:31:57 You're going to be left behind in the revolution.
00:31:58 Good.
00:31:59 Prepare to have your fucking.
00:32:01 Oh God, what's the word?
00:32:02 Prepare to have the have your means of production seized.
00:32:05 Is there any place in this lonely old anarcho communist world for an anarcho capitalist just
00:32:11 trying to make a buck?
00:32:13 Yeah, in a fucking grave.
00:32:16 It is the place.
00:32:17 Tom Cruise looks like Keanu Reeves in the poster for the last samurai.
00:32:21 This guy looks so like.
00:32:23 OK, tell me it's not true, Nate.
00:32:25 Tell me he's not the last samurai.
00:32:27 Tell me there's more.
00:32:28 There's hope for man.
00:32:29 Even even now there has to be hope for man.
00:32:32 Well, you know, interestingly, the last samurai focuses on how Tom Cruise is not in fact.
00:32:37 Well, he kind of was the last samurai standing at the end of the film.
00:32:41 I guess I'll spoiler alert.
00:32:42 It's about the transition from the the way of the samurai from Japan incorporating like
00:32:49 1870 and whatnot, more like Western technology and the emperor being all up on up on that
00:32:54 business.
00:32:55 But then Tom Cruise, a lonely old soldier from the Indian uprisings in America and the
00:33:00 Civil War and whatnot.
00:33:01 It's about him addressing the sins of his past and finding comfort in the ways of the
00:33:07 Eastern samurai warrior and learning to quiet his mind in times of tumult.
00:33:12 Is this really just a parallel to your life, Nate?
00:33:15 Is it the big screen?
00:33:18 Yes, the answer is yes.
00:33:23 God, I hope so.
00:33:24 This lonely soy boy twink roaming around the streets of America begging for a cock to suck.
00:33:30 It's shipped off a cargo crate to Japan and just learns the way of the of the of the piston
00:33:37 punch is able to become a full blooded samurai and make YouTube dollars like no one king
00:33:43 or emperor had ever seen before.
00:33:46 Oh, you know, I don't know.
00:33:48 I suppose this is whatever it doesn't.
00:33:50 It's just that there's something real.
00:33:52 There's something like it's it's you feel there's a hopelessness.
00:33:55 The movie ends with the samurai just being like, yep, our time's up.
00:33:59 Samurai are done.
00:34:00 So we're just going to go fight and then we'll all die.
00:34:02 And Tom Cruise who became a samurai, you know, whatever.
00:34:05 He became one of the peeps during the thing.
00:34:07 He became fell in love with their ways.
00:34:10 He like everybody else died except for him.
00:34:12 So he is, I guess, the last one and everyone else is like, yeah, that's it.
00:34:15 Samurai are done.
00:34:16 But oh, there was beauty in their simple lives.
00:34:18 Oh, there was there was a there was a humble, these noble savages.
00:34:23 Ain't nobody calling them noble savages.
00:34:25 They're just noble, Ben.
00:34:26 They're just noble.
00:34:28 Yeah, I know.
00:34:29 Yeah, I it's been a long time.
00:34:32 It's been a long time.
00:34:33 Some people have called this like a white savior film.
00:34:37 It could not be further from the truth.
00:34:39 It's about how the white man could learn so much from the East and how they're better than us.
00:34:44 And now I need my samurai sword to cut down these filthy Western enemies of God's creation,
00:34:50 a.k.a. the samurai and God, I could not be more on board.
00:34:56 Wait, no, they fucking lose the war, right?
00:34:59 Like Tom Cruise just gets absolutely like gunned down by like the like new invention of
00:35:04 the tide of history turning slowly against them.
00:35:07 Yep.
00:35:08 Yeah.
00:35:09 But there's there's beauty to be found in that history.
00:35:11 Oh, it's beautiful.
00:35:12 I fucking love it.
00:35:13 That's so good.
00:35:14 That's it.
00:35:15 PCP is over.
00:35:16 Nate says like playing off his his kabuki armor.
00:35:21 And his beetle off my armor.
00:35:26 Nate Bestman is the last podcaster.
00:35:31 Listen, everyone's going fucking VR.
00:35:34 Everyone's going on hologram.
00:35:36 Yeah, they're just getting they're just getting auto directed like like like via syringe
00:35:40 directly into their fucking eyeball.
00:35:42 No one's got time for podcast anymore.
00:35:43 We can't fight the tide of history, man.
00:35:45 We all know the way of the future is Internet drama, Internet blood sports, you know, etc.
00:35:49 But I sit here making my humble whittling away bit by bit in my humble anime reviews and
00:35:55 I will not cease.
00:35:56 I will let history crash around me as I stand against the tide because I would rather die
00:36:01 on my feet than die on my knees as a slave.
00:36:04 That's how I am.
00:36:05 And that's how it will go for me.
00:36:07 Remember me, the last anime reviewer on YouTube.
00:36:10 Games upon video essay.
00:36:13 Clicked new track over a thousand times just completely completely made into a mirror shine
00:36:21 polished into oblivion.
00:36:23 And I will slice down any of the naysayers.
00:36:26 Point being, I just watched The Last Samurai before recording this episode of the PCB and
00:36:31 it was a great time.
00:36:33 Highly recommend.
00:36:34 I can't tell if The Last Samurai is like genuinely good or if it's just actually good.
00:36:40 I'll let you know what the difference between those is never.
00:36:44 I actually had like ten minutes left but I gotta say, you know what's funny, here's
00:36:49 my little bit more of a review.
00:36:52 I could not have loved this movie more.
00:36:54 It was absolutely fantastic.
00:36:56 But like it ends with, so like the thread going up through the background is that like
00:37:02 America wants to do an arms deal with Japan and Tom Cruise has brought over to like train
00:37:07 the Japanese soldiers in the western ways or whatever.
00:37:09 And like that's all fine.
00:37:10 Then it becomes a samurai later.
00:37:11 But like the idea is that like Tom Cruise decides to join like the honorable samurai who are
00:37:17 defending like the ancient ways of Japan.
00:37:19 And like they know that history is going against them.
00:37:21 But like we can't forget who we are like Japan, you know, whatever we've got the spirit.
00:37:25 We can't just be cut by the west or whatever.
00:37:27 But like it ends with the emperor just being like, they were cultivating this whole deal
00:37:32 between Japan and an American weapon or whatever.
00:37:35 And just like, nah, fuck it.
00:37:36 At the end he's like, I am convinced by these samurai who all died in defense of their ways.
00:37:40 Like we can't forget that we are Japanese.
00:37:42 So I guess that means we won't use modern technology and we won't progress.
00:37:47 And I'm like, is that really the lesson to take away?
00:37:50 I didn't learn anything.
00:37:52 That's kind of like, I'm with you.
00:37:54 Like remember the spirit of Japan.
00:37:56 Don't forget who you are.
00:37:57 That's all fine.
00:37:58 But like you got to buy new weapons to like defend yourself.
00:38:01 So what have we learned here?
00:38:03 Like they did.
00:38:04 So it's weird that it's like painting as though it didn't happen.
00:38:09 I don't really understand exactly what the point of it is.
00:38:13 I guess just don't forget the spirit of Bushido or whatever, which is pretty cool.
00:38:18 Yeah, I wish I was a samurai.
00:38:20 That's how I feel.
00:38:23 Living a simple life.
00:38:24 I think we can all learn something from 2003 is the last samurai.
00:38:28 And about Tom Cruise's role in the history of Japan.
00:38:32 Directed by Edward Zwick.
00:38:34 Is that kind of fucked up?
00:38:36 That like Japan was wiped off the face of the earth because they weren't able to like buy new weapons
00:38:41 because Tom Cruise stopped them from participating in the Meiji Restoration like in 1870.
00:38:47 Isn't that fucked up, guys?
00:38:49 Isn't it fucked up that in America their invention of the guilty gear system nuked all of Japan
00:38:54 and no survivors were reigned afterward?
00:38:56 That sucked.
00:38:57 That was too bad.
00:38:58 I think I saw a lecture about that.
00:39:01 I think so.
00:39:02 One historical document.
00:39:04 It is Tom Cruise's soul bad guy.
00:39:07 I think we can pretty much all agree.
00:39:09 Is Tom Cruise Tom Oliver and he single-handedly destroyed Japan?
00:39:13 God, I wish.
00:39:17 Well, there you go.
00:39:18 There's my review of the last samurai.
00:39:20 Speaking of goddamn movies that we saw.
00:39:23 Alright, here's the bombshell that I want to drop here.
00:39:27 I'm going to spin a yarn here because it is like the lowest point of my entire life.
00:39:32 I did something really bad.
00:39:34 I did something like naughty.
00:39:35 I did something that I'm going to have to get on my hands and I'm going to have to confess to you guys.
00:39:38 I saw the live action line king movie and I know.
00:39:44 No, how dare you pay for that.
00:39:46 I know.
00:39:47 I know.
00:39:48 Listen, this is a mistake.
00:39:49 That's human core.
00:39:50 Seeing Disney remakes is the most human core thing you can do.
00:39:54 No, seeing them is fine.
00:39:55 It's paying for them to see them.
00:39:57 They're both wrong in their own way.
00:40:00 Listen.
00:40:01 Okay.
00:40:02 Here's I want to paint a picture for you.
00:40:05 It's the last day of my trip in San Francisco.
00:40:08 This is the last moment that I'll be able to have in San Francisco.
00:40:12 So far, it's been a wash, really.
00:40:14 I mean, the piers were nice.
00:40:16 The fishmen's worth were nice, but I didn't really get a sense of anything truly local.
00:40:20 It just felt like a bunch of tourist traps.
00:40:22 And Chinatown the previous day was the epitome of that.
00:40:26 It was just completely just four numbskulls come in here, spend a lot of money and then get out.
00:40:32 There was nothing of actual substance inside of it.
00:40:34 Sure.
00:40:35 The next day, we're walking across the city.
00:40:38 We see a lone movie theater and we see the lion king is playing.
00:40:43 It's about, you know, maybe four or five.
00:40:46 We get seats.
00:40:48 We watch the lion king.
00:40:49 It's a nightmare.
00:40:50 And, you know, we ha ha chuckle about how bad it is.
00:40:53 You know, we think that we've made a fine decision in watching a movie that was bad for the sake of just joking about it.
00:41:00 And then we vowed to watch the original.
00:41:02 Big mistake.
00:41:03 And then we walk to what was the point of that day.
00:41:07 For you see, we wanted to check out Chinatown's sister, Japan Town, because we thought there would be a great time.
00:41:13 Wait, is that a real thing?
00:41:15 It's completely real.
00:41:16 It's completely real.
00:41:17 What town is this in?
00:41:18 San Francisco.
00:41:19 You have a Japan Town?
00:41:21 Yeah, Japan Town.
00:41:22 Do they do they frequently perform Nanking reenactments on Chinatown?
00:41:26 Are they next to each other?
00:41:28 Oh, God.
00:41:29 Tensions are high.
00:41:30 They're actually separated for fear of riots, so, you know, they're separated by people.
00:41:33 Race war!
00:41:35 So, so, so we get out the lion king.
00:41:37 We had just spent $14 to see live action lion king, the sun setting.
00:41:43 And San Francisco, if you guys don't know, it's vertical.
00:41:46 It's a TF2 map.
00:41:47 It's a quick green map.
00:41:48 It's vertically integrated.
00:41:50 Literally.
00:41:51 It's a vertical slice.
00:41:52 There are vast mountains we must climb up to to get to our destination.
00:41:57 We're crawling up talking about how John Oliver Azazi was so bad.
00:42:01 Seth Rogen is poomba was so bad.
00:42:03 We're walking.
00:42:04 We're walking.
00:42:05 And so far, we're just twiddling our fucking thumbs.
00:42:08 We've wasted our time here in the city.
00:42:10 We get to Japan Town, ready to have some fun.
00:42:13 We're ready to, hopefully, Japan Town to live up to the promise of what we thought China Town would be.
00:42:18 We're here to save the trip.
00:42:20 It's closed.
00:42:22 Every single shop in Japan Town is closed.
00:42:25 Just like Japan after they dropped the bomb.
00:42:27 I mean, by that, I mean, Guilty Gear happened and Japan was wiped off the map.
00:42:31 Literally.
00:42:32 So, we're rushing through.
00:42:34 We're seeing, oh, used anime VHS store.
00:42:37 We're seeing cool, like, manga book stores that we've got inside, too.
00:42:41 We're seeing all these little food like sushi stands we could have gone into.
00:42:45 We're seeing all these things that we would have loved to see.
00:42:49 We're seeing all these things that we have spent an entire day inside of.
00:42:54 Just this one little mall in Japan Town.
00:42:58 And we gaze upon the iconic Japan Town Tower Pagoda thing.
00:43:03 You can Google search.
00:43:04 And when you Google search, like, it seems to go to Japan Town, there would be like a needle looking thing.
00:43:07 We looked upon that.
00:43:08 And we saw, and we thought, we wasted our time in San Francisco watching the live action Lion King.
00:43:15 That was what we spent today doing.
00:43:17 That's what we spent our last day doing was, was paid money for our own bondage, was paying money for Disney
00:43:25 to monopolize more and more and more and to enslave us instead of actually living our lives.
00:43:30 I already ruined the trip to San Francisco.
00:43:33 And as we laid there, depressed, sobbing on the floor for our own mistake,
00:43:37 it's no one's fault but ourselves that this calamity was done to us.
00:43:42 We sit there and we think, and we think to ourselves that even now there's hope for man.
00:43:48 Don't say this is how it has to be.
00:43:50 And then the next day, we had our steely American resolve, our steely Japanese resolve.
00:43:56 We were the way of the samurai.
00:43:58 We were, at that point, the last samurai looking.
00:44:01 The tide of history, us going home, it cannot clash upon us.
00:44:05 The spirit flowed into you, giving you power.
00:44:07 And did you know, Munchy, that when a samurai, according to the Code of Bushido,
00:44:10 I think I said this last time, but when a samurai rides into battle,
00:44:13 he considers himself already dead as it makes him deadlier.
00:44:17 And I'm sure you felt the same way beginning your mission that day.
00:44:21 And so we woke up extremely early.
00:44:24 The crack of dawn, like seven, we got out to the city
00:44:30 and we spent our final moments before we were set to leave.
00:44:34 And keep in mind, this is a torturous drive.
00:44:37 This is like a seven hour drive to our destination.
00:44:40 We had to have left as soon as possible or else we would be dead tired by the time we got there.
00:44:44 If you could factor in stops and stuff like that, you know, do the bathroom.
00:44:47 So we had to get in there and out.
00:44:49 And we willingly flogged ourselves and made it to Japan Town
00:44:53 in time for everything to open.
00:44:55 And we spent a few cursory moments looking over the anime VHS store and the manga store.
00:45:01 It didn't, we was saved. We saved the trip.
00:45:05 You did it.
00:45:06 And at, I believe it's called like Sakura Books or something in that effect,
00:45:11 I bought the first volume of One Piece.
00:45:14 And I'm starting my journey.
00:45:16 Of course.
00:45:17 One of these days, I will become a ship captain.
00:45:20 Like I guarantee you.
00:45:22 The journey, the fact that you, oh my God, that honestly, that's an inspiring story.
00:45:28 You persevered and you did not give up on your quest despite all the hurdles you face.
00:45:33 And what did you get?
00:45:34 What was your prize for pursuing this and obtain your goal?
00:45:37 It was the greatest prize of all, the beginning of yet another new journey.
00:45:42 Adventure, yes.
00:45:43 That's what could be better.
00:45:45 And that's why that's how One Piece is going to end.
00:45:47 Mark my words with the beginning of a new adventure because that's what life is about people.
00:45:51 It's about pursuing your goals and find fulfillment in doing so.
00:45:55 That's how the samurai lived.
00:45:56 And that's how you live, Munchy.
00:45:58 And as the last samurai myself, I'm happy to dub you.
00:46:01 My samurai for life.
00:46:03 Welcome.
00:46:04 Welcome to the club.
00:46:05 Oh my God, honorary samurai.
00:46:07 This is like the reverse of what we were talking about at the beginning.
00:46:09 This is callbacks.
00:46:10 This is true narrative stakes.
00:46:12 This is it.
00:46:13 Yes.
00:46:14 It's happening.
00:46:15 It's Ghazam Kutsverk of epic proportions.
00:46:18 They're going to get to the monopoly, the anarcho-capitalism island.
00:46:22 And then Luffy's going to get up and he's going to watch live action Lion King.
00:46:25 And that's how One Piece is going to end.
00:46:27 Incredible.
00:46:28 Incredible.
00:46:29 Well, Munchy, I could not be happier to hear.
00:46:32 You know, people talk, even me, you know, when I'm week to week, me and Gib doing the
00:46:36 potty cast, we get all wrapped up and like, what's happening right now in these chapters?
00:46:40 Actually, when we do the potty cast, you guys probably don't listen because you're not on
00:46:43 the latest chapter or anything.
00:46:45 I wouldn't know.
00:46:46 But like, we can be very critical of like, what's happening on any given chapter, especially
00:46:50 considering reading chapter to chapter is kind of the most critical way.
00:46:54 Cause you're like, is the thing that happens next going to live up to our expectations?
00:46:58 Is like, like, is this art going the way we want?
00:47:00 We can be very critical.
00:47:01 But every time I look back and read like any section of One Piece, if there's a reason
00:47:06 why I do it every week, it's the only thing I talk about every single week because it
00:47:11 has brought me the most joy of anything I've been involved in my life.
00:47:15 And I'm such just a humbled fan to be able to, I don't know, talk about and share it
00:47:21 with people like you and other people who I've had the honor to get into One Piece
00:47:25 through listening to the stuff I've said about it.
00:47:27 So I'm just, I'm so happy for you.
00:47:29 And I'm so, whatever, you don't owe me anything.
00:47:31 You don't owe anybody enough that you could hate it.
00:47:33 And that's fine too.
00:47:34 But it just very, makes me very happy to hear.
00:47:37 I mean, so far I'm obviously only a chapter in, but just the art itself is a loan for
00:47:42 me to want to keep watching.
00:47:44 It only gets better.
00:47:46 I mean, I believe you.
00:47:48 It's so different.
00:47:50 It's not, it's not your, like, I don't know, we all, there's a lot of discussion in anime
00:47:54 circles about how like anime all looks the same.
00:47:56 It's all the same.
00:47:57 One Piece is so unique.
00:47:58 It's such a unique style and a lot of people don't like it, but I love it.
00:48:02 People don't like it because it doesn't look, it doesn't, doesn't really look like anime.
00:48:06 It kind of looks like a, I feel like the Otis art style has sort of like a kind of French
00:48:11 Belgian-ish kind of look to it a little bit.
00:48:14 Yeah, I see that actually.
00:48:15 I know what you mean by that.
00:48:16 Yeah.
00:48:17 I think I know what you mean.
00:48:18 But it's very cartoony and, you know, sort of proportion sometimes and whatnot.
00:48:22 Well, whatever, man.
00:48:23 Yeah, I could go on all day about One Piece if I don't want to lecture anybody about it.
00:48:26 I'm just very happy to hear that you're, you're, you're getting on the bus, getting on the
00:48:30 boat.
00:48:31 If you're ever in a new location, here's my advice to you.
00:48:34 And I said this advice before, but I need to reiterate because even myself, I forgot.
00:48:38 Don't go anywhere just because other people go to it.
00:48:41 Have a reason.
00:48:42 If you have a reason to go to Chinatown, if you look up on Google Maps and there's like
00:48:45 a cool restaurant you want to go to, by all means go to Chinatown.
00:48:47 But don't just go there, you know, because it is the thing to do.
00:48:51 Because you're going to get fucked up and you're not going to be able to learn the joys
00:48:55 of whatever your town's equivalent to Japan town is.
00:48:58 There's surely a cooler place you could be going to than something that everyone else
00:49:02 already has.
00:49:04 Probably true.
00:49:05 Easily.
00:49:06 Easily.
00:49:07 Easy.
00:49:08 Easy fucking peasy.
00:49:09 Well, what a journey.
00:49:10 What a Japan-centric episode.
00:49:12 My favorite kind.
00:49:13 God, I want to play Sekiro again.
00:49:15 Sekiro is the greatest game ever made.
00:49:17 I love Japan, period.
00:49:19 And that's all there is to say about it.
00:49:21 But by the way, also in Japan town, I got a manga that's exclusively in Japan and I can't
00:49:26 read it.
00:49:27 It's a Kirby manga that wasn't released in the West.
00:49:29 Oh, fascinating.
00:49:30 She should put a picture up somewhere.
00:49:32 Yeah, sure.
00:49:33 I will.
00:49:34 Because I can't Google it.
00:49:35 I will take a picture and I will put in the show notes.
00:49:38 Fantastic.
00:49:39 Fantastic.
00:49:40 Hey, I have a left turn topic I wanted to bring up that's a total other thing.
00:49:44 Before we switch topics, I just noticed an odd little pattern.
00:49:48 It has absolutely no meaning.
00:49:50 But everyone, all the PCP members currently in the chats, the exception of then has a
00:49:56 six in their Discord number.
00:49:58 And I just noticed that and I thought that was kind of funny.
00:50:01 Fascinating.
00:50:02 Yep.
00:50:03 Once again, I'm the odd man out.
00:50:05 I'm the lone.
00:50:07 I'm the champion.
00:50:08 Oh my God.
00:50:09 Majest number is the...
00:50:10 I don't know if I should say the number, but I will say that it includes 666, just in
00:50:15 the thing.
00:50:16 Is that a coincidence?
00:50:17 What's up with that?
00:50:19 That's weird.
00:50:20 Well, now they only have to try 10 different combinations.
00:50:23 Wait, no.
00:50:24 40 different combinations.
00:50:25 No, there's...
00:50:26 I mean, the thing is, I don't add people if I don't know them.
00:50:30 So, you know, even if they do...
00:50:32 Well, hang on.
00:50:33 Surely there's more than, you know, 9,999 or I guess 10,000 people on Discord.
00:50:39 Well, here's my logic.
00:50:40 I mean, you're Discord...
00:50:41 Yeah.
00:50:42 Wait, you're right.
00:50:43 But your Discord number is only four numbers, right?
00:50:44 I think the name is like relevant somehow.
00:50:46 Like the name is incorporated in your...
00:50:47 The thing is, people can't really add me due to the heart and my name.
00:50:51 Yeah, right.
00:50:52 Oh, yeah, that too.
00:50:53 That too.
00:50:54 The purple heart protects me.
00:50:56 Purple heart.
00:50:57 Just like John Kerry, protected him from losing the presidential election.
00:50:59 Oops, that didn't happen.
00:51:01 Moving on.
00:51:02 Sad.
00:51:03 Listen to this.
00:51:04 I've got five words that I was just thinking of as a result of a recent experience that
00:51:10 I will describe briefly, and it's that magic is IRL...
00:51:14 Oh, sorry, sorry.
00:51:15 Music.
00:51:16 Music is IRL magic spells.
00:51:20 Music is a lot like love.
00:51:21 It's all a feeling.
00:51:22 It's all a feeling.
00:51:23 And it fills the room from the floor to the ceiling.
00:51:25 It does.
00:51:26 Is that what you're saying?
00:51:27 That's basically what I'm saying.
00:51:28 Music is pure magic.
00:51:29 Okay, cool Curb of Manga.
00:51:30 She just uploaded it.
00:51:32 So I was just thinking about this, and this pertains to all media.
00:51:35 But I was just thinking about this.
00:51:36 This is probably a really obvious observation, but I felt it very powerfully the other day
00:51:40 because I've been watching with a pretty strong interest Digi's like top 100 anime openings
00:51:47 that he's been doing because Digi is actually...
00:51:49 This is one of the things that I really like to listen to Digi talk about.
00:51:53 Frank, I'm not that interested in like his music takes necessarily, but obviously we overlap
00:51:57 in anime and I care about that.
00:51:59 But like Digi's taste is very different from like your average like watch mojo top 10 anime
00:52:05 opening, like whatever.
00:52:06 Like I was watching, I commented on his video that just had all the openings and like the
00:52:10 opening to, and this is the song I wanted to bring up, Gunslinger Girls is this song
00:52:16 Light As We Land by the Delgados, which I had never heard before.
00:52:21 I've never seen Gunslinger Girl, but like I was instantly transfixed and like, damn,
00:52:26 that song is really dope.
00:52:27 And so when Digi, he's doing like in breakups of 20 at a time, he's like talking about them
00:52:32 each individually.
00:52:33 And I'm really enjoying it.
00:52:34 At least like skipping around to the ones I like because it was a lot of fun.
00:52:37 And like when he gets to this one, this is the one I was most interested in.
00:52:40 And he just talks about how like actually this song is the first track on the album
00:52:46 Hate by the Delgados.
00:52:48 And it's actually, it's one of it, like he loves the album.
00:52:51 And this is actually one of his least favorite songs on the album.
00:52:54 And so I was immediately like, well, I need to go listen to this fucking album because
00:52:57 the song is incredible.
00:52:59 But I had that most optimal experience for enjoying music, which was I was on a drive
00:53:06 at night in summertime, windows down, wind in my face, cranked up this song in my ears
00:53:13 as like I'm just looking at like the lights of the city passing by as I'm driving by.
00:53:17 And this song, Light As We Land by the Delgados, go listen to it.
00:53:22 It sounds like the soundtrack one plays while you're committing suicide.
00:53:27 That's what it sounds like, only not in like funny like, I want to die like shit zoomer
00:53:32 way, but like the old, you know, doomer way of like life is crushing me.
00:53:37 Classic suicide.
00:53:39 Classic suicide because it's about the pain of life not touching you.
00:53:45 This is what I understand.
00:53:46 Did you describe it?
00:53:47 It's about how while you're floating in a happy state of mind, not focused on the bad
00:53:55 things of life, but that the light as you land that fades as you come crashing back down
00:54:00 to reality.
00:54:01 Now this sounds a lot like suicide.
00:54:03 Yes.
00:54:04 Sorry.
00:54:05 That's the only anime song I know.
00:54:07 Hey, no problem.
00:54:08 It's the only one that matters.
00:54:09 Here's my point.
00:54:10 To get back to my point, I absolutely love the song.
00:54:12 I'm going to go listen to this album hate.
00:54:14 I can't wait to go listen to it because if it's as good as did you seem to be implying,
00:54:17 it's going to be incredible.
00:54:20 I was listening to the song and I'm like, music is the strongest magic known to man
00:54:26 because it just has this quality of like, I think about like the people who write music
00:54:32 like Bach or, you know, any modern band, the Degades who made this song, they sit down
00:54:37 and they like work on riffs and they work on notes and they work on lyrics and they
00:54:41 work on chords and all that shit.
00:54:43 And they're literally weaving a magic spell and this spell has the effect on me.
00:54:48 Someone who's basically music illiterate.
00:54:50 I know a little bit.
00:54:51 Not very much.
00:54:52 I play more guitar later, which has been a lot of fun as a result of Digi's thing and
00:54:55 other stuff.
00:54:56 Cool.
00:54:57 Yeah.
00:54:58 I've been having a great time.
00:54:59 I was actually playing, I was practicing another song from that.
00:55:02 What is it?
00:55:03 Hit in the USA by someone I can't remember, but it's the opening theme to Beck.
00:55:08 Mongolian chop shop or whatever.
00:55:10 Squad.
00:55:11 I don't know.
00:55:12 It's a hard ass rock song and I fucking love that opening.
00:55:15 It's dope.
00:55:16 I have a pedal so I can sound really hardcore and overdrive and whatnot.
00:55:20 Okay.
00:55:21 It doesn't matter.
00:55:22 Point was I was saying like these people, they're like witches concocting a witch's
00:55:27 brew.
00:55:28 They're throwing in there their eye of newt, thrown in their leg of virgin, they're throwing
00:55:31 in their period blood of menstruating mother.
00:55:33 I don't know.
00:55:34 They're throwing in all kinds of weird components and the result is on the other side, people
00:55:39 like me who don't understand music theory basically at all.
00:55:43 And I don't know.
00:55:44 Like we're just totally ignorant to the process.
00:55:46 Nonetheless, it has such a powerful effect.
00:55:49 It just, it's as such a, I don't know, it just makes me feel all kinds of things that
00:55:54 I don't even understand exactly why I feel them.
00:55:58 And this is true of like all media, but it strikes me that like music is like the most
00:56:02 effective because you don't have to have any lyrics.
00:56:04 Yeah.
00:56:05 Music also is like, it can be quite manipulative, not necessarily in a bad way, but sometimes
00:56:09 in a bad way.
00:56:10 Yeah.
00:56:11 And like certain scenes and let's say movies, they wouldn't be as powerful or impactful
00:56:15 or like a tear-jerkingly without the music gets really underrated on us.
00:56:22 I think a lot about Anthony Fantano once said, somebody asked him on one of his Q&A's
00:56:27 like, or one of his ask, whatever, let's argue, I think something like music is overrated
00:56:33 as like a, like a medium or whatever, like, I don't know, like something like video was
00:56:38 better or like music would be nothing without video.
00:56:41 Something like that.
00:56:42 And, and he just said like, think about if you watched your favorite movie without the
00:56:47 soundtrack.
00:56:48 And you know, I was, I was thinking about that as I was watching like The Last Samurai,
00:56:51 it's got a great score, Hans Zimmer and all that.
00:56:53 I was just thinking if the exact same things were happening, I had all these emotions.
00:56:58 I loved the character so much and it was so badass and it got me so invested in like the
00:57:03 way of like this, these humble Japanese samurai just wanting to honor their way of life and
00:57:08 their ancestors.
00:57:09 I was like, I feel you guys, I feel you in a big way.
00:57:12 But if you, if you just play that exact same movie without the soundtrack, I think it would
00:57:16 have, I think I would have been like, I mean, fuck these guys, like time to get, you know,
00:57:20 get with the times, your way is over idiots, gotta buy guns, gotta put down the bow and
00:57:25 arrow, pick up a fucking gun, you're, you're idiots.
00:57:28 Another really interesting thing about the music is a timely lack of music can be just
00:57:36 as impactful as having music in certain other times.
00:57:39 At the right time for sure.
00:57:40 Yeah, exactly.
00:57:41 Absolutely true.
00:57:42 But like, you know, if it was like lack of music throughout the whole thing, it wouldn't
00:57:45 be as impactful.
00:57:46 So it has to be like, like perfectly placed lack of music, I would say.
00:57:50 It's like, I just watched, I was watching a demo, Demolition D, Twitch stream the other
00:57:54 day and it was streaming, or Twitch or whatever, it was streaming Kill Bill Volume 1 and like,
00:58:00 the fight against Oren Ishii after the crazy eight fight is incredible.
00:58:04 And oh my god, that fight is so sick against Oren.
00:58:06 Like this, this like Spanish Latin cover of Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood starts playing
00:58:12 and it's the fucking sickest shit of all time.
00:58:15 And I would actually, I use that exact song in Gurren Logan part two review.
00:58:21 I use it like the hypest moment because it is like the hypest song of all time.
00:58:24 But like, and after, at the end, when Oren finally gets like a hit on Beatrix or whatever,
00:58:30 like the song cuts and then you just have like the two of them kind of stumbling around
00:58:34 in silence and like this, once again, beautiful like Japanese courtyard with like the snow
00:58:38 falling and just these two women, you know, due unto the death, but like it's dead silence.
00:58:43 And then they just like this, the hum of the swords and whatnot.
00:58:46 It's, I don't know, I just after this experience driving, listening to the song and just like
00:58:52 feeling like, like why am I feeling so many powerful emotions right now, listening to
00:58:56 the song that I don't even really understand what it's about.
00:59:00 I was like, this is a magic spell.
00:59:02 This is a modern day magic spell.
00:59:04 I don't understand what's going on.
00:59:05 Isn't it strange that the human body has such a reaction to music?
00:59:11 It is strange.
00:59:12 Because because like what?
00:59:13 Why do we have it?
00:59:14 Yeah, what exactly?
00:59:16 I understand like, for instance, like like pictures or, you know, like stories because,
00:59:20 you know, we can relate to them and we can understand language and we can understand
00:59:25 what it's like to like have emotions displayed by like text and ideas being communicated
00:59:30 to us.
00:59:31 Yeah.
00:59:31 But why do we get ideas from something abstract as noise?
00:59:36 Because like, I understand why something may like shock you.
00:59:39 I like like like like a symbol may jurt you like because a loud sound noise would be
00:59:43 evolutionary beneficial for you to like be alert at someone's coming to get you.
00:59:47 But why are we soothed by certain things?
00:59:49 Why are we like like brought to to feel like a triumphant music?
00:59:53 Why can we understand the emotion of music when like those things don't
00:59:57 like appear in nature or I can't imagine they have a theory.
01:00:03 Sure.
01:00:04 It's like, in a way, actually, it kind of goes with a with a topic I was thinking
01:00:08 about bringing in about like universal sort of symbols in a way, how like a lot of people,
01:00:15 at least in a lot of cultures, let's say red would be a color of danger or passion.
01:00:20 You know, stop signs of red.
01:00:21 It's a very bright color.
01:00:24 It's the color of blood.
01:00:25 It's the color of like it's so bright and a lot of poisonous creatures are
01:00:31 brightly colored and maybe they use red.
01:00:33 I haven't checked out how many of them use red.
01:00:35 But yeah, so it's music is sort of like, you know, a sound version of that in a way
01:00:41 because it might be sort of mimicking like sort of like a sounds or noises that
01:00:47 like represent certain sort of emotions like how red is passionate.
01:00:51 And scary.
01:00:52 So you have noises, something like that.
01:00:54 And like if you combine, let's say, blue with white, you can maybe paint
01:00:58 some clouds in the sky and it's it looks like a bright sunny day, but you can also
01:01:01 paint ice and it'll be cold and snowy.
01:01:04 So music, certain sounds, you combine them together and they can create
01:01:07 different types of moods.
01:01:09 You know, Majaba's thinking that too.
01:01:11 But the thing is, like you bring up the color example and like colors do exist in nature,
01:01:16 obviously.
01:01:16 So like humanity had a long time to like adjust to thinking certain
01:01:21 things about different colors and whatnot.
01:01:23 But like the thing is like music, as we understand it, is not something that
01:01:27 really occurs in nature outside of like animal cries or like like the like, I
01:01:32 don't know, the major chords.
01:01:34 Where do they appear in nature?
01:01:36 You know, I don't know much about course.
01:01:38 Like I'm just, you know, this is just me speculating and guessing like at the
01:01:43 moment I haven't done research about it.
01:01:44 I have a theory, though.
01:01:45 Yeah.
01:01:45 Well, I mean, I think I think most people would probably agree.
01:01:48 But it's like, I think that music, as we understand, it's easy to be like music
01:01:53 exists now, like where did it come from?
01:01:55 Like surely like something like taught it to us as humans.
01:01:59 I just think that as the process of civilization has progressed, like music
01:02:03 is literally we've discovered brain hacks that just some sounds just for
01:02:09 basically pure coincidental reasons, some sounds just sound good to the human
01:02:13 ear and the human brain.
01:02:15 And like we're kind of doing revisionist history if we think that like there's
01:02:19 really any explanation for why what we perceive to be music, like is the thing
01:02:24 that sounds good or bad or whatever.
01:02:25 I think that we just have categorized things that we basically discovered by
01:02:29 accident, by trial and error as humanity has just progressed.
01:02:33 I think music is another form of communication in a way, like a very
01:02:38 primitive one, like how, you know, certain voices to us like sound good, like a
01:02:43 calm voice is nice and gentle.
01:02:44 And then if someone's yelling, then you know, that's dangerous.
01:02:47 So music is sort of the same way.
01:02:49 Maybe it's like to convey like a sense of danger, a sense of calmness.
01:02:53 You know, that's true too.
01:02:54 Like there's a reason why in like rock songs, like obviously it doesn't
01:02:57 really inform you in terms of like chord structure, whatever, if someone's like
01:03:00 yelling versus whispering.
01:03:02 So I totally agree.
01:03:03 Music is like a combination of these two things.
01:03:05 I think like like music theory specifically, like that's the kind of
01:03:09 thing I'm saying is like specific like note progression from note to note or
01:03:12 whatever, evoking like a certain, like a minor chord sounding sad.
01:03:16 That's not something that occurred in nature.
01:03:18 I think that's something that we've just like figured out and then
01:03:21 documented.
01:03:21 And now we just, you know, we all like kind of are aware that a minor kind of
01:03:24 sounds sad or anything like that.
01:03:27 I think it's just music could be like a transformative thing of the sounds we
01:03:31 actually have heard and trying to mimic.
01:03:33 How like, I like to sing how people said like, oh, you know, they looked at a
01:03:37 bird one time and then they decided to make a plane.
01:03:40 So music is sort of like that.
01:03:41 They heard a noise and they decided to sort of mimic it, but in their own
01:03:44 different spin, spin off of that sort of noise.
01:03:48 So something sad sounding that they sounded sad, they tried to mimic it with
01:03:53 music or like, you know, making a noise similar to it and then integrated into
01:03:57 music.
01:03:58 I definitely think that's part of it.
01:03:59 It's interesting you bring up a minor, Nick.
01:04:01 Did you hear about a minor?
01:04:03 No.
01:04:03 He grew up.
01:04:06 He was sexually assaulted.
01:04:10 I don't like that.
01:04:11 I was waiting for that.
01:04:12 Kill me.
01:04:13 No, I love puns.
01:04:15 I was waiting for that.
01:04:16 That was good.
01:04:19 If we want to move on, I have to have a move on.
01:04:22 Yeah.
01:04:22 No, no worries.
01:04:23 Okay.
01:04:23 I just, I remembered this in the middle of this and I've been bursting to get it
01:04:26 out.
01:04:26 This is incredible.
01:04:28 Okay.
01:04:28 Okay.
01:04:29 American listeners.
01:04:30 Right.
01:04:31 And actually, Munchie and Nate, this is true of you too.
01:04:34 Oh no.
01:04:34 American listeners.
01:04:35 I am about, and maybe you'll know what I'm talking about, I am about to make you
01:04:41 $125.
01:04:44 Do you know what this is?
01:04:45 No.
01:04:45 I think I did hear you discussing this somewhere, but go on.
01:04:48 American listener, you can just fucking send, okay.
01:04:54 So there was this thing, this company Equifax leaked a bunch of data and there was a settlement.
01:04:59 And like, if your data was, and like 147 million Americans were, if your data was leaked by Equifax,
01:05:05 you are entitled to $125.
01:05:09 You can get it.
01:05:10 So I'll put a link in the description.
01:05:14 If there's a link, it takes you to a thing.
01:05:16 You just put in like your name and like part of your social security number.
01:05:18 It will tell you like, yes, you were affected or not.
01:05:21 And if you were, you just fill in your information and Equifax will send you a check for $125.
01:05:27 I'll do that.
01:05:28 I'll do that.
01:05:28 I'll do that.
01:05:29 I'll do that.
01:05:29 I'll do that.
01:05:30 I'm speaking of data leaks.
01:05:33 There's also, you can also, if you, there's more like, if you, if you, you can say like,
01:05:38 I mean, I doubt this would apply to anyone, but like, if you spent time like, like doing stuff,
01:05:43 like if it costs you like labor hours, you can like apply for like some more for that.
01:05:47 But like, okay, there's, there's the possibility, like if, if everyone in the world,
01:05:52 like, like if, if everyone like files for this, there might be a run on it and like,
01:05:56 because like the total settlement amount is only like, I think it's like $380 million.
01:06:02 So if like everyone files for it, like, you know, it might, the number might go down.
01:06:07 There might not be, yeah, the number might be reduced, but I don't know.
01:06:10 Who knows if that'll happen.
01:06:12 So yeah, a fucking link in the description.
01:06:13 Get in there fast, I guess.
01:06:14 Yeah.
01:06:15 Well, I don't know if it's fast.
01:06:17 I think it's just going to end up being like the total number of, of, of however many people
01:06:21 file a claim.
01:06:21 And I don't, and I don't know how much longer there is to do it.
01:06:25 But yeah, I saw, I saw a tweet from AOC about this and I was like, huh, and I followed it up.
01:06:31 And yeah, I'm fucking eagerly awaiting my $125 check and you should too.
01:06:36 And letting me know in the comments if it, if it works.
01:06:38 So some people, some people.
01:06:40 Yeah.
01:06:40 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Senator from New York.
01:06:44 Some people might represent it.
01:06:46 I think she's a senator.
01:06:47 No, no, no, she's a Congresswoman.
01:06:48 Congresswoman.
01:06:49 Oh, okay.
01:06:49 Yeah.
01:06:50 Okay.
01:06:50 Congresswoman.
01:06:50 Some people might think like, oh, Nate corporate cocksucker, but I could not be more
01:06:55 okay and totally cool with something like this.
01:06:58 Anyone who abuses their authority or abuses their power absolutely should be held accountable.
01:07:02 And so yeah, I'm gonna fucking do this.
01:07:05 Sounds fair to me.
01:07:06 I want to, I want to quickly mention or rather ask, have you got like, okay, today is 28th.
01:07:12 Have you guys heard about like the supposed discord raid on the 27th that was supposed
01:07:16 to happen yesterday?
01:07:18 No, no, like several weeks, uh, uh, leading up to like today or yesterday, I guess, um,
01:07:25 I keep, I kept hearing shadows and whispers.
01:07:27 I was like, oh, there's going to be a raid.
01:07:29 Is there's going to be a dox?
01:07:30 There's going to be hacking.
01:07:30 There's going to don't delete the PCP discord server, delete it right now.
01:07:34 We have to burn the evidence.
01:07:37 Don't, don't.
01:07:38 Yeah.
01:07:38 Basically just like, don't accept any friend requests.
01:07:40 Don't, don't click any suspicious links from your friends and stuff like that.
01:07:43 You know, everyone's just like, oh, I'm sorry.
01:07:47 But you know what I got?
01:07:47 You know what I got this morning in the PCP mail?
01:07:50 You know what we got?
01:07:51 Labs, we got two subsequent emails that were from, I looked at this, they're from a URL
01:07:57 that's like, it's like YT, they say we are the YouTube team.
01:08:02 YT-creator.ru, which is the Russian URL.
01:08:07 And in the body, they say, um, excuse me, we have detected that your YouTube channel is
01:08:14 uploading spam or something like that.
01:08:16 Like we will take punitive actions unless you provide your name, like social security number,
01:08:22 and password to your fucking account.
01:08:24 They asked, it actually happened.
01:08:26 You can go look at it.
01:08:26 It's fucking in our email.
01:08:27 So did you do it?
01:08:28 Did you give it to them?
01:08:29 Of course I did.
01:08:30 Ben, I don't want to get fucking taken.
01:08:32 Absolutely.
01:08:33 Yeah, okay.
01:08:33 Don't fuck with the Russian.
01:08:34 No, I did not send the main thing obviously.
01:08:36 Give them whatever they're asked for.
01:08:37 Yeah, I've actually seen that around.
01:08:39 Like one of the, one of my YouTubers, I watched hopeless speeches.
01:08:42 She posted it on Twitter as well.
01:08:43 And I was like, holy shit, it's happening.
01:08:46 That's, it's really funny.
01:08:47 Like I wasn't even close to attempting it.
01:08:49 Oh, I'll look at this right now.
01:08:49 This is so fucking bogey.
01:08:51 Isn't it cute?
01:08:52 It's crazy.
01:08:52 You want to screen cap it and put it in the...
01:08:54 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:08:55 Sick.
01:08:56 Sick.
01:08:56 Fantastic.
01:08:57 That's it.
01:08:57 It's so like poorly formatted.
01:09:00 It doesn't look anything.
01:09:01 Like the YouTube logo was like squished and warped.
01:09:04 And that's why the official, official people always says like,
01:09:07 you know, the official team will never ask for your password.
01:09:10 We'll never ask for your password.
01:09:12 If I hadn't been told in so many emails by YouTube previously,
01:09:16 we will never ask for your password.
01:09:18 I may have been more tempted to give them a password,
01:09:21 but I wasn't even tempted because I'm a good boy.
01:09:24 This message seems dangerous.
01:09:25 Oh yeah, there you go.
01:09:26 They're telling us it seems dangerous.
01:09:28 Fucking yeah.
01:09:29 You can see the URL in that picture too.
01:09:30 Fucking Ruskies.
01:09:32 There is it.
01:09:33 Those sneaky...
01:09:33 It's in the gross disgusting audio links.
01:09:36 Oh, incredible.
01:09:38 Yeah.
01:09:40 So what do we do?
01:09:41 Are we fucked?
01:09:42 We're fucked.
01:09:43 We're going to be terminated imminently.
01:09:45 There's nothing to be done, I guess.
01:09:46 We just have to accept our fate like the samurai of old.
01:09:50 Yeah, yeah, exactly.
01:09:51 We have to lay down our arms and say something we can do.
01:09:53 We can't fight the tide of history,
01:09:54 aka Russian bots.
01:09:55 Oh, speaking.
01:09:56 That's right.
01:09:57 Speaking of dying, press F for Ben's glass.
01:10:01 Oh yeah.
01:10:02 Yeah, before we started recording,
01:10:05 I tipped over my favorite glass
01:10:07 and it shattered on my desk,
01:10:09 sending tea and apple cider vinegar,
01:10:12 cascading over my desk on all my sensitive electronic equipment.
01:10:17 We heard the crash.
01:10:18 It was not recorded.
01:10:20 I wish we recorded that crash.
01:10:21 It was quite dramatic.
01:10:22 I do too, and I realized that all of my computer shit
01:10:25 is ergonomically designed,
01:10:27 so that none of the tender mechanisms are on the surface.
01:10:31 They're all lifted.
01:10:32 Yeah, they're all held slightly above,
01:10:34 like my microphone, my monitors, my speakers.
01:10:36 They're all held above the water level.
01:10:39 Ben, do the favor.
01:10:40 That's, yeah.
01:10:41 Red pill me on apple cider vinegar.
01:10:43 What's the deal?
01:10:45 Okay, I can't give you-
01:10:46 Do I drink that?
01:10:47 Do I chug it?
01:10:48 Is that what I do?
01:10:49 I mean, I wouldn't chug it.
01:10:50 I just put some of it in like-
01:10:51 That's good.
01:10:51 I mix like-
01:10:52 I mix like-
01:10:53 And why do you do that?
01:10:54 Why do you do that?
01:10:54 I mix like lemonade, stevia,
01:10:57 or lemon juice, stevia, some apple cider vinegar,
01:11:00 mix it in water, add ice.
01:11:01 It's good.
01:11:02 For what apple cider vinegar is good on in salads?
01:11:06 I've read that it's good for your metabolism.
01:11:09 Okay.
01:11:10 And also just think it tastes good in that mixture.
01:11:14 Yeah, so that's kind of just-
01:11:15 I drink a bunch.
01:11:16 Okay, I'm sold.
01:11:17 I'm sold.
01:11:18 Yeah, I couldn't-
01:11:20 There's probably more.
01:11:21 That was like a cleaning product or something.
01:11:23 I think I've used it for like athlete's foot in the past or something.
01:11:27 Okay, it is obsessed with vinegar flavored things.
01:11:30 Why would you use apple cider vinegar specifically?
01:11:32 I mean, if I did, if I'm remembering correctly,
01:11:36 I'm pretty sure I just-
01:11:36 I did like a Google and went to like a how-to,
01:11:38 like how to like treat athlete's foot.
01:11:40 I think it said like soak in apple cider vinegar or apple cider vinegar.
01:11:42 Apple cider vinegar.
01:11:44 Whatever, you know what I'm talking about.
01:11:45 Apple cider vinegar.
01:11:47 Actual vinegar.
01:11:48 Same shit.
01:11:48 Yeah, it does clean stuff.
01:11:50 Okay, I might just be wrong.
01:11:51 I might just be wrong about that.
01:11:52 But okay, fair enough.
01:11:52 Fair enough.
01:11:54 Yeah, I fucking-
01:11:55 It's fucking vinegar.
01:11:56 Go through that.
01:11:57 I go through that apple cider vinegar,
01:11:58 like it's something you would go through at a very rapid pace.
01:12:05 Fantastic.
01:12:06 If you can imagine.
01:12:08 Do you guys, like in the America,
01:12:10 do you have like salt and vinegar flavored chips?
01:12:14 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:12:15 Oh, okay.
01:12:16 I've never been a fan.
01:12:17 I've never liked them.
01:12:18 I didn't like them as a kid, but-
01:12:20 UK has a lot of vinegar flavored things.
01:12:22 It confused me.
01:12:24 Animals, subhuman.
01:12:25 Not a fan.
01:12:28 One of the PCP heads that showed up to the RCK meetup
01:12:31 was like, oh, you got to have
01:12:33 fish and chips with salt and vinegar on them.
01:12:35 You got to have it with vinegar.
01:12:37 And I didn't-
01:12:38 Dude, you got to have a colonectomy
01:12:40 and a colonoscopy at the same time.
01:12:42 You've got to do it, bro.
01:12:43 It's a euphoric experience.
01:12:46 Same argument.
01:12:48 What do you guys think?
01:12:49 About voicemails?
01:12:51 Yes.
01:12:51 What do you guys think about it?
01:12:52 We can do them right now, if you want.
01:12:53 Yes.
01:12:54 I got them.
01:12:55 Now, we don't have too many.
01:12:56 We've got, I think four today?
01:12:58 Four?
01:12:58 Yeah, all right.
01:12:59 That's a very low batch.
01:13:01 You know, we've been getting fewer,
01:13:02 and I think that we maybe discouraged them
01:13:04 because I've been so harshly critical
01:13:06 on everybody who's been calling in.
01:13:08 Well, hopefully they're good now.
01:13:11 I mean, these are all pretty good,
01:13:13 I thought.
01:13:13 I thought they were all quality submissions.
01:13:15 And you know what, four?
01:13:16 Pretty healthy number.
01:13:17 Pretty healthy number.
01:13:18 But I encourage everybody.
01:13:19 Keep sending them, because I like them,
01:13:21 and I'm happy to have as many as possible.
01:13:22 I don't mind.
01:13:23 I don't mind listening to more.
01:13:24 Okay, but let's get to it.
01:13:26 Oh, and a link to the Speak Pipe
01:13:27 is down in the description.
01:13:29 Go click on that, and send us your voicemails.
01:13:31 If they're good, do cool things.
01:13:33 I like cool things.
01:13:34 All right, but our first one is from Polenta Meister.
01:13:39 Polenta Meister.
01:13:40 Yeah, it's a weird one.
01:13:41 Okay, let's see what he has to say.
01:13:43 You know this person?
01:13:46 What's their reputation on the street?
01:13:49 I mean, I like them.
01:13:50 You like, okay, all right, fair enough.
01:13:51 Let's see if they live up to it.
01:13:53 All right, go.
01:13:54 Hello, Pipe.
01:13:55 It's your boy, Polenta Meister.
01:13:57 I just want to tell you guys that we've recently talked
01:14:00 about a topic that has grown near and dear to my heart
01:14:04 at recent times.
01:14:05 Because after going back to my country,
01:14:09 after a period of working overseas in an office every day,
01:14:13 I've gone back to working out and exercising my body.
01:14:17 I gotta say, I completely forgot how good it feels.
01:14:19 Yes, yes, true.
01:14:21 It's really like 20 to 30 seconds into your reps.
01:14:24 You feel like you're dying.
01:14:26 I feel like you're turning into a sludge of primordial soup
01:14:30 and sweat and lactic acid, but five minutes into them
01:14:36 and you start to feel the endorphins rushing through your veins
01:14:38 and pumping straight into your skull.
01:14:41 And man, I gotta say, there is no way for me to say how good it feels
01:14:46 other than comparing it to playing corruption of champions
01:14:50 and slowly turning your avatar into a trembling mound of flesh
01:14:54 and pieces of the giant and changing artfaces.
01:14:59 But it's in real life and you're turning yourself from being a weakling,
01:15:05 a pasty spaghetti man into a sculpted doness.
01:15:12 Yes.
01:15:12 I gotta say, guys, there's no excuses.
01:15:16 Even you, Tom, can just build yourself a new spine and you're good to go.
01:15:21 Yeah, Tom, quote unquote.
01:15:23 Yeah, Tom.
01:15:24 Get that new spine in there.
01:15:25 Tom Cruise, maybe if you'd fucking done more reps
01:15:27 then the Japanese wouldn't have lost the word.
01:15:29 Maybe you'd done more reps.
01:15:30 The samurai wouldn't have been cut down.
01:15:31 Yeah, you'd be like five foot, you know, 10, five foot, 11,
01:15:34 maybe six feet.
01:15:34 If you'd done those spine reps, you cowered.
01:15:37 All right, well, let's move on.
01:15:40 I wait.
01:15:40 Yeah, yeah.
01:15:41 I wanted to say that I've been fucking,
01:15:43 I've mentioned this before, I'm lifting again.
01:15:46 I've been lifting for three weeks now and I'm fucking ripped.
01:15:49 How many times a week do you go?
01:15:51 Three times a week.
01:15:52 That's good.
01:15:53 That's great.
01:15:53 Yeah.
01:15:54 Doing starting strength.
01:15:57 Speaking of those power cleans.
01:15:59 That's great.
01:15:59 I should do those too.
01:16:00 It brings me, it makes me literally want to cry when I think that Tom is too hurt to work out
01:16:06 and he wants to go to the gym and he can't because by no fault of his own,
01:16:11 his spine is just fucked and it's fucked up.
01:16:15 I mean, I've been talking to him.
01:16:16 I don't know if there's anything we can do.
01:16:17 I told him just to let us know, but he can't even work because he's in pain.
01:16:22 I don't know if you should even say it, but like, God, it's fucking not fair.
01:16:26 It's not fucking fair.
01:16:27 He was going to go to BronyCon.
01:16:30 He wanted to go.
01:16:31 He can't go because he's hurt.
01:16:33 He can't go.
01:16:33 Yeah, his spine is just fucked and couldn't walk around.
01:16:35 It's not like he was even like playing B-ball hard in the court
01:16:38 and he like broke his like, like, lol, shoot, I can't go to BronyCon.
01:16:41 No, he didn't do anything.
01:16:42 It's just his back is fucked for no reason.
01:16:45 Oh, it's fucked up.
01:16:46 Tom, thoughts and prayers, bro.
01:16:48 Thoughts and prayers.
01:16:49 Thoughts and prayers.
01:16:50 Yeah, it's useless.
01:16:51 I just wish I could help.
01:16:52 Okay, whatever.
01:16:53 Enough of that shit.
01:16:55 Seems like seems like I don't know.
01:16:58 I mean, I don't know if I don't want to be pessimistic, but like,
01:17:00 it seems like it's just like gotten worse, like with for no reason.
01:17:04 I mean, I guess Tom says, I think he says.
01:17:07 I don't really.
01:17:07 I should I mean, I probably shouldn't like comment on it without like talking to him about it.
01:17:11 It's just my pressure.
01:17:12 You're right, you're right.
01:17:13 Maybe I'll ask him if he even wants us to include this.
01:17:15 I just don't want to share personal info if he doesn't want us to, but I don't know, whatever.
01:17:19 Okay.
01:17:20 Anyway, oh, and I was going to say just specifically on working out.
01:17:23 So I've been lazy about working out for the last couple of weeks.
01:17:26 I think I went like two weeks ago once and I've been lazy.
01:17:29 But but the good news is I have been perfect on my diet for the last like month.
01:17:35 And I think I've lost, I've lost a steady.
01:17:37 I can see it in my progress a solid six, seven pounds.
01:17:41 And those those are real weight loss.
01:17:43 That's not meme weight loss.
01:17:45 And it's going going pretty good.
01:17:47 I only want to lose like 25 pounds from that starting point.
01:17:50 So once I get down there, I'm going to be going to be feeling good.
01:17:53 But of course, the hardest thing is to gain muscle.
01:17:55 So this is the easy part.
01:17:56 I got to be lifting like a real boy.
01:17:58 Let's go keto, man.
01:17:59 Let's go keto.
01:18:00 I'm telling you.
01:18:02 Yeah.
01:18:03 Wait, I don't know.
01:18:05 I think this is probably fine to say oblivion fall contacted me and told me that he was grateful
01:18:11 that I had spread the good word of keto to him.
01:18:14 Yeah.
01:18:15 He showed me before and after pictures of like the thing.
01:18:19 Oh, did he?
01:18:20 Yeah, he messaged me on discord specifically.
01:18:23 No, no, he on Twitter.
01:18:24 Oh, he could include that if he wants to while he's editing.
01:18:27 Well, yeah, he showed me like before and after pictures from like February this year.
01:18:31 And then like recently he lost, I think he lost like 30 or 40 pounds.
01:18:35 It's great.
01:18:36 Yeah.
01:18:37 That's fantastic.
01:18:38 I mean, assuming he wasn't already underweight, in which case that would be bad.
01:18:40 But I assume that was not his ailment.
01:18:42 He was a little chunky.
01:18:43 He was a little chunky.
01:18:44 And now he's objectively better.
01:18:47 I'm sorry.
01:18:48 Fantastic.
01:18:48 Fantastic.
01:18:48 I shouldn't.
01:18:49 That's fatphobic.
01:18:52 You know, I'll say.
01:18:53 No, he's always beautiful on the inside.
01:18:55 Of course.
01:18:56 Of course.
01:18:56 One can make a comment upon a one's outside visage and bodily structure without being
01:19:01 judgmental of their inside.
01:19:03 Well, he was stoked.
01:19:04 Well, he was stoked about it.
01:19:05 I'm currently, this will be out on the day we're recording this.
01:19:09 I will almost a hundred percent be finishing my Uyagawa on Dunbaru Nankiromotaru,
01:19:15 the anime about weightlifting.
01:19:17 And I'm very excited about it.
01:19:19 Yeah.
01:19:19 Yeah.
01:19:20 Yeah.
01:19:20 Yeah.
01:19:21 This is going to be good.
01:19:22 Talk about.
01:19:22 Did you see May's video about that?
01:19:25 Oh, I did see it.
01:19:27 I like skipped around through it and I thought her point was valid.
01:19:31 I don't specifically talk about like her video because like, I mean her point is good.
01:19:36 The thing is I'd already been thinking about that while I watched it.
01:19:38 While I watched it.
01:19:39 Yeah.
01:19:40 I mean, would you be right to say that she's not really a fan?
01:19:44 You know, it seems like.
01:19:45 Well, to be fair, I didn't really watch the whole video.
01:19:47 I don't remember if she said that she like liked it overall, but it seemed like the focus
01:19:50 of the video was on like the like the unhealthy like body imaging or whatever.
01:19:56 I mean, I say this is my video.
01:19:58 That's absolutely true.
01:19:59 Well, I mean, while it came up, it's absolutely true.
01:20:01 She makes a pretty good point that like, she's like, oh, this girl, this girl is like,
01:20:05 this main character is like a ghast that she weighs like 130 pounds.
01:20:12 Okay.
01:20:12 Well, the thing is like we need to first of all, you need to use Japanese standards,
01:20:16 not American standards.
01:20:18 And yeah, I have no idea what like the average woman weighs in Japan.
01:20:21 So like an American looking at that, first of all, you're already coming at it from the right.
01:20:24 What if the Japanese standards are unhealthy?
01:20:28 Well, but they just, I mean, they have a different build.
01:20:30 They have a different body type than like, I don't know, Italians or, you know, Polish people.
01:20:34 I mean, well, okay.
01:20:36 So we just need to know the facts.
01:20:37 Like what's a healthy body weight for a Japanese person?
01:20:39 I don't know.
01:20:40 Well, who decides what's healthy?
01:20:41 Well, what's the average fucking body weight of it?
01:20:43 Like, let's at least have the facts before we decide.
01:20:46 You can't just look at the average numbers and be like, okay, this is what's, well.
01:20:52 Look, a doctor could tell you what's like, you know, what is healthy to unhealthy.
01:20:56 I'm thinking there's a, maybe I'm thinking there's a, I'm thinking there's like a,
01:21:00 there's a culture, there's a cultural aspect to it too.
01:21:03 It's not like, we're not talking pure biology here.
01:21:06 I mean, that's possibly true.
01:21:08 But I mean, I don't know what the threshold for like, unhealthily overweight is for like,
01:21:13 a Japanese woman, because 130 pounds is, I mean, it depends on like your height and,
01:21:18 you know, a lot of things like your bone structure and, and all kinds of stuff.
01:21:21 But I'll give you what you want.
01:21:22 I agree that like, it does seem like Hibiki is a little bit overly concerned in terms of like,
01:21:27 if her concern is health, but the show couldn't be clearer.
01:21:30 Her concern is, I want to be hot to get a boyfriend.
01:21:33 You can view that as shallow and that's perfectly fine.
01:21:36 But this is her motivation.
01:21:38 And that's, that's all there is to it.
01:21:40 Yeah.
01:21:41 Well, all right.
01:21:42 Yeah, fair enough.
01:21:43 So it is, huh?
01:21:45 What, wait, what mage?
01:21:46 But she's kind of already hot, isn't she?
01:21:49 Well, okay.
01:21:50 This goes to the other issue.
01:21:51 Okay.
01:21:51 First of all, we can, we can talk in the West.
01:21:53 There's, you know, a increasing standard of like, we like fit girls.
01:21:57 Sorry, I meant to say thick, thick girls.
01:22:00 I mean, I'm personally, I'm not the biggest fan of that body type.
01:22:03 But like, you know, I appreciate it.
01:22:05 Like everybody else, I appreciate everybody type.
01:22:07 But like in Japan, I don't think that is the necessary consensus.
01:22:11 I'm sure to some degree it is.
01:22:13 I don't know.
01:22:13 I'm not Japanese.
01:22:14 So I can't really speak to it.
01:22:17 But, but there's another concern that ties into that.
01:22:19 That's like another criticism that may makes.
01:22:21 And I mean, I had thought the moment I saw the anime preview,
01:22:24 I thought this to myself, it's that Hibiki starts the series as, you know,
01:22:28 whatever she wants to lose weight.
01:22:29 I mean, she's not, I mean, there's that, there's that one like close-up shot,
01:22:35 like from like the bottom, like a down and up shot that like emphasizes
01:22:39 how like pudgy she is at an absolutely, at the absolutely horrifying like 135 pounds.
01:22:45 And then there's like, okay, she, she goes through the numbers and like the numbers
01:22:48 don't make sense.
01:22:50 I thought that, that was interesting.
01:22:52 I, the numbers, you know what?
01:22:53 I didn't even look at the numbers.
01:22:55 They give her, they give her like, they give her weight, her height,
01:22:57 her body fat percentage and a couple of other numbers.
01:23:00 And May explains how like these numbers don't make any fucking sense.
01:23:02 And I, and I, and I was convinced.
01:23:04 I mean, I guess that goes to my point.
01:23:06 That's fine.
01:23:07 But I mean, at what point should we think, okay, well, I'll just say that it's,
01:23:10 it's true.
01:23:11 At the very least, I totally agree that based on like the Hibiki we see at first
01:23:16 and the Hibiki in the manga for the most part,
01:23:18 like just your average shot of Hibiki from the anime,
01:23:21 she looks like a perfect idealistic anime girl.
01:23:23 And that doesn't make sense for this show.
01:23:26 It is simply preposterous.
01:23:28 That's the, that's the opposite of what the show's point is.
01:23:31 She was, she was drawing a little thicker in the manga, right?
01:23:34 She was, but not consistently.
01:23:36 So the manga is also not perfect in this way.
01:23:38 It is better than the anime significantly though.
01:23:41 So I mean, that's the stuff I talk about.
01:23:43 I just want to, since you were talking about the show, I wanted to
01:23:47 May's video about it.
01:23:48 That's all fair.
01:23:49 I just happened to see that on Twitter like two weeks ago or whatever.
01:23:52 In terms of, you know, now I'm kind of curious.
01:23:54 I did not analyze the numbers.
01:23:56 Maybe I'll go back and look at that.
01:23:57 Cause I did not even pay attention to where they made sense or not.
01:24:00 I don't know.
01:24:00 Whatever, it doesn't matter.
01:24:03 Okay, anyway, big tangent over.
01:24:05 Let's get back to our next fucking voicemail healer.
01:24:07 We've got one from Zoomer Don.
01:24:10 Zoomer Don.
01:24:10 Okay, ready, set, go.
01:24:13 Hello, PCP.
01:24:14 It's Zoomer Don.
01:24:16 No voice changer, no instrumental,
01:24:18 no asking for relationship advice.
01:24:20 Just a simple request here.
01:24:23 When I am recording this, Nate's last stream was Minecraft.
01:24:27 And man, that shit was cringe.
01:24:31 Nate, you are going to lose subscriber.
01:24:33 Oh no.
01:24:33 But my request is for Munchy, fellow Zoomer overlord.
01:24:37 Oh, hi.
01:24:37 To teach this fucking boomer the ropes, man.
01:24:40 Cause I know he wants to play with fitMC in the future,
01:24:43 and I don't want him to embarrass himself.
01:24:46 Nate was like, guys, what does shift cooking do?
01:24:49 He starts shift cooking randomly.
01:24:51 Chat, are you trolling?
01:24:52 It's not doing anything.
01:24:55 I did do that.
01:24:56 You have to taste your own medicine.
01:24:58 Oh my God.
01:25:00 You don't know what to shift cooking?
01:25:03 I learned.
01:25:04 I learned what it meant.
01:25:05 I still haven't.
01:25:06 What does shift cooking do?
01:25:08 It makes it automatically snap to your hot bar.
01:25:12 Also your inventory from shifts.
01:25:14 Yeah, it basically groups your items,
01:25:16 and it's more efficient than clicking and dragging and stuff,
01:25:18 which is a pain that I've been doing a lot of.
01:25:20 So fair, fair.
01:25:21 And also I just wanted to spell this like,
01:25:23 Nate stays awake at night rocking back and forth,
01:25:27 pining for the day when he can play Minecraft with fit.
01:25:30 If only I was man enough at Minecraft to do it.
01:25:33 I mean, sure that'd be fun.
01:25:36 And yeah, I do.
01:25:37 If I did, I would embarrass myself.
01:25:39 So I'm not even interested in asking,
01:25:41 but the narrative being paint here is incorrect, sir.
01:25:46 You're overselling it, so relax.
01:25:50 Now wait, you fellas, hold it.
01:25:52 You went and oversold it.
01:25:54 I guarantee that you've got their hat and care.
01:25:57 Compare.
01:25:58 Oh, that's an old one.
01:25:59 So if that's an important ingredient,
01:26:00 can't be added on experience quality,
01:26:02 my friends, and quality care.
01:26:04 Quality care.
01:26:06 Oh, do you know what that is?
01:26:07 There's your trivia day.
01:26:08 Don't tell them.
01:26:09 Guess, guess.
01:26:10 So say in the comments what that is.
01:26:11 Guess in the comments.
01:26:12 Guess in the comments.
01:26:13 How much money did you steal from?
01:26:15 Did you ring out of the grasp of Equifax?
01:26:18 And what is that song?
01:26:20 I'm just like one, I'm just imagining right now,
01:26:23 like a Nate versus Finn MC, like Minecraft challenge.
01:26:27 Like they go toe-toe in the arena.
01:26:29 I can't beat him at Minecraft, dude.
01:26:30 I'm imagining, it will literally be like an anime fight.
01:26:35 Finn will have his hacks on,
01:26:37 and he'll just be speeding all around you,
01:26:39 and he'll have the shadow ninjitsu models of his own self.
01:26:44 They have shadow clones all around you.
01:26:46 Okay, that's fair.
01:26:46 You'll hopelessly try to shift click your sword
01:26:49 into your hot bar, and then you miss,
01:26:51 and then you throw it outside,
01:26:52 and you drop the sword onto the ground.
01:26:54 Okay, all right, that's true.
01:26:54 Well, he fucking does the hit, the crit.
01:26:58 That will happen, but that'll be the beginning of the arc
01:27:01 where you face the final opponent
01:27:03 at the beginning, you get utterly dominated.
01:27:04 But that'll be before my like 10 month Minecraft
01:27:07 training montage, like I did in the Pokemon race,
01:27:10 and more successfully in the Dark Souls race,
01:27:13 where I obtained every skill
01:27:15 and practice every movement over and over dozens of times
01:27:18 to obtain god-like speed and agility,
01:27:20 and I will have set traps up
01:27:22 to counter his cheating hacks
01:27:24 and his god potions and whatnot, and ultimately.
01:27:27 If you make the underdogs,
01:27:29 it's just gonna win eventually, because underdogs always.
01:27:32 Smash cut to like a year from now,
01:27:34 like the rematch, fit MC, like cracks his knuckles in Minecraft,
01:27:38 aka post, ashras, cracks knuckles, asterisks in the Minecraft.
01:27:41 I achieved my samurai sword,
01:27:44 mastered Bushido.
01:27:46 He does his shadow clones, and then he says,
01:27:49 Nani, and then he sees the nether crystal in your hands,
01:27:52 and he's like, where'd you get that?
01:27:54 And then he says, you can't teach a new dog old tricks.
01:27:57 And he says, what?
01:27:58 And then you blow him up,
01:27:59 and then you have your blast resistant diamond armor on,
01:28:02 you walk out unscathed from the burning inferno behind you.
01:28:06 And I'll say, fit more like shit.
01:28:10 That'll be my final word on the subject.
01:28:14 And then he'll never be heard from again.
01:28:17 Moving on, we've got a voicemail from Tyga Mike.
01:28:20 Tyga Mike, let's see what you got.
01:28:23 I love this guy, I don't even know him.
01:28:25 Hello, I come to you all with a dire grievance.
01:28:29 Me and my fellow voicemailers are having our vocal labor exploited
01:28:33 by the disgusting host class of the PCP community.
01:28:38 True.
01:28:38 We deserve to be paid an amount equal to the ratio of time
01:28:41 our minute and a half takes up on the show
01:28:43 as we provided the labor of entertainment during that time.
01:28:48 Saying it's your platform,
01:28:49 and thus you don't have to,
01:28:50 is like saying corporations deserve to make a profit
01:28:53 because they own the means of production their employees work on.
01:28:56 As 169 episodes and counting have passed
01:29:00 without this injustice being corrected,
01:29:02 it is only just that we viewers take violent action
01:29:06 to overthrow our oppressors.
01:29:08 Dismantle the pro capitalist podcast.
01:29:11 Bullets for bed, news for bed, burn the mage,
01:29:15 eat the munchies, guillotine gift, ground digi,
01:29:19 wage cucks of the world, unite.
01:29:23 Yeah, hard agree.
01:29:26 Hard agree.
01:29:26 Also just a little trivia.
01:29:28 So we're like 170, almost episodes in, right?
01:29:32 Yeah, this will be 170.
01:29:33 This is episode 170, yeah.
01:29:34 Yeah, okay.
01:29:35 So but like the voicemails weren't around for 170 episodes.
01:29:40 We know mage, but revisionist history is a hell of a thing.
01:29:45 At least get your facts right before burning me.
01:29:48 We've probably played enough voicemails
01:29:51 to comprise an entire like two hour episode by now.
01:29:55 I'd probably give you at, I suppose.
01:29:56 Well, maybe, maybe an hour, I don't know.
01:29:59 Well, listen guys, just be thankful that you're even on the show
01:30:03 because we have an arms deal with guests being on the show
01:30:06 and so you know if we're not gonna need voicemails
01:30:08 because we're gonna have just guests lining and filling all the time for us.
01:30:12 So why get a prerecord message when you have any guests on the show?
01:30:14 Your guys are going the way of the samurai
01:30:16 and I think you better hold on to your culture, you still have it.
01:30:21 I want to acknowledge that we are indeed,
01:30:23 we are indeed exploiting the labor of our voicemail callers.
01:30:28 This is, we must do this.
01:30:32 We must do this to survive in capitalism
01:30:35 and this is why the system should be dismantled from the top.
01:30:38 We don't have to though because we, we did it like for centuries without it.
01:30:42 We are, we are, we are forced to.
01:30:44 We are incentivized to do this.
01:30:45 Oh no, we're servants, we're mere slaves.
01:30:47 Oh, if only our bondage was broken.
01:30:50 If only our bondage was broken.
01:30:53 We have to pay, we have to, we have to
01:30:55 fucking pay into social security
01:30:57 and we have to fucking squeeze our viewers for content.
01:31:01 This is the trade-off.
01:31:03 Couldn't be more accurate, couldn't be more accurate.
01:31:06 All right, we got one more final voicemail of the day
01:31:08 and speaking to capitalism and corporations,
01:31:10 AldiCorp is calling in with another message.
01:31:12 Back to shill his Twitter.
01:31:15 Well, let's see what he has to say.
01:31:17 All right, go, go, go, go.
01:31:18 What a great day for me, CEO of AldiCorp.
01:31:22 Spending the bustling AldiCorp business center.
01:31:25 Nothing could possibly go wrong.
01:31:28 Let me answer that.
01:31:30 Hello, CEO of AldiCorp at your service.
01:31:33 Yes, I remember the Twitter ad from two weeks ago.
01:31:37 What? It was cut?
01:31:39 Oh, no, no, no.
01:31:40 We spent all our marketing budget on it.
01:31:42 If we can't make a return, we're in serious trouble.
01:31:45 What are stocks?
01:31:47 They've dropped so far, the Wall Street Computer's blue screen.
01:31:51 We're literally paying people to take our money.
01:31:54 What is that word?
01:31:54 That's not how stocks work.
01:31:56 I can't believe.
01:31:57 Oh no, it's the PC police.
01:32:00 They're gonna put me in voice jail, aren't they?
01:32:03 It's all over.
01:32:04 This company is finished.
01:32:05 All my life's work gone to waste.
01:32:08 I'm bankrupt.
01:32:09 The rest of my days will be behind bars and debtors' prison.
01:32:13 All for a stupid Twitter ad.
01:32:15 Oh, what have I done?
01:32:18 What have I done?
01:32:20 Lock him up.
01:32:22 You live by the Twitter ad, you die by the Twitter ad.
01:32:24 That's all there is to it.
01:32:26 Okay, okay, I knew what they said.
01:32:28 Okay, you could lock him up,
01:32:29 but it sounds like he kind of burned to death at the end there.
01:32:32 I mean, he's on the run.
01:32:34 It's only a matter of time.
01:32:34 Well, we'll take his mangled corpse to the voice jail.
01:32:37 He's an official member now.
01:32:39 He's in there.
01:32:39 Check the post in the description.
01:32:42 He's literally there.
01:32:43 Good job, I'll die of you've ruined everyone's lives,
01:32:47 including our own.
01:32:48 Listen though, I'll die.
01:32:49 We should, can we privatize the PC prison system?
01:32:55 Can we profit off of this somehow?
01:32:56 Can we exploit their labor?
01:32:58 I don't know about necessarily privatizing,
01:33:00 but I'll tell you what, what we can do
01:33:01 is just be extremely corrupt.
01:33:04 And I'm happy to just,
01:33:06 if Alda just gives us money,
01:33:09 you know, I mean, maybe that could get him out of voice jail.
01:33:11 I mean, that seems like a pretty good idea.
01:33:12 We're not saying anything.
01:33:13 I mean, it just could happen.
01:33:15 I mean, anything could happen, you know?
01:33:17 We're just saying.
01:33:18 We do live in a world of possibilities.
01:33:21 We sure do, Ben.
01:33:22 We sure do.
01:33:24 Well, I guess that's it.
01:33:25 That's it for the voice mail.
01:33:27 Okay, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.
01:33:28 I still have one more issue
01:33:29 about the whole burn the mage.
01:33:31 Mame the mage sounds better, so.
01:33:33 Mame the mage, that's much better.
01:33:35 Okay, me and mage didn't get any,
01:33:37 like, M alliteration for some reason.
01:33:39 Everyone else got alliteration when we didn't.
01:33:41 I got, we got, we got.
01:33:42 Bullets for Ben, news for Nate.
01:33:44 Yeah.
01:33:45 Drown did you?
01:33:46 Drown did you?
01:33:46 Guilty gib.
01:33:48 Guilty gib, yeah.
01:33:50 So what the fuck, dude?
01:33:51 You know what?
01:33:52 Yeah, you deserved a rod in the voice jail.
01:33:54 Fuck you.
01:33:55 I got.
01:33:55 What did you get, Munchie?
01:33:56 Eat the Munchie.
01:33:57 Eat the Munchie.
01:33:58 How about murder Munchie?
01:33:59 How about fucking murder Munchie?
01:34:00 Yeah, murder, murder Munchie.
01:34:02 Murder Munchie, name the mage.
01:34:04 There we go.
01:34:04 Name the mage.
01:34:04 We fixed it for you.
01:34:05 Yeah, that's right.
01:34:06 And I mean, if Tom was here, we could,
01:34:14 lethal injection, Tom.
01:34:15 Yeah, there you go.
01:34:16 Got it.
01:34:17 He'd thank you for it anyway.
01:34:18 He'd thank you for it.
01:34:19 Lethal ejection, lethal aurora.
01:34:20 Yeah, lethal injection, lethal aurora.
01:34:22 Oh, that's pretty good.
01:34:23 Yeah, yeah.
01:34:23 That's pretty good too.
01:34:24 Excellent.
01:34:24 We made it.
01:34:25 How about, try to think of
01:34:28 what's this tea?
01:34:28 What's a murder tea thing?
01:34:30 Julie, there's something.
01:34:31 OK, so this is what your demand,
01:34:33 your demand compensation for.
01:34:34 You're coming up to us with your
01:34:36 fucking like child's macaroni drying,
01:34:38 a.k.a. your voicemail.
01:34:40 And you're saying, hey, can you put this
01:34:41 in the museum, please?
01:34:43 And then we have to go in here
01:34:44 with our expert painterly brush
01:34:46 and cure it and actually make a real
01:34:48 official painting out of the slop
01:34:50 that you've given us.
01:34:51 It's only us who are stuffing.
01:34:53 You don't see the only victim here
01:34:55 as us right now.
01:34:56 That's the only victim.
01:34:56 Wait, I've got it.
01:34:57 It's true, but I've got it.
01:34:58 Traumatized Tom, because what they're
01:35:00 going to do is Tom will be left alive
01:35:02 as the figurehead of the old regime,
01:35:04 so as to make peace with the common
01:35:05 people who still respect their old
01:35:07 overlords.
01:35:08 That's his role.
01:35:09 That's his role.
01:35:10 Traumatized Tom.
01:35:11 He's already pretty traumatized,
01:35:12 but a little more couldn't hurt.
01:35:13 Tear up Tom.
01:35:14 Oh, that's pretty good too.
01:35:15 Yeah.
01:35:15 Trample.
01:35:16 Trample Tom.
01:35:17 Trample Tom.
01:35:17 I like trample.
01:35:18 Trample Tom.
01:35:19 No, no.
01:35:19 These are all great ideas.
01:35:21 He's riding on the floor right now.
01:35:22 His spine doesn't work.
01:35:23 It'd be easy.
01:35:24 Yeah.
01:35:24 Oh, and undress Jess.
01:35:26 Oh, that's, I don't know what that is.
01:35:28 Oh, Lord.
01:35:31 That's a winner.
01:35:33 Oh, God.
01:35:34 Guys, you know what we should definitely do?
01:35:35 We should definitely incentivize
01:35:37 people to come up with all the ways
01:35:38 that we could die.
01:35:39 That's a great idea.
01:35:39 We should definitely laugh and joke
01:35:41 about that.
01:35:41 Guys, post and chat the many ways
01:35:42 that you want to murder us.
01:35:44 I think that's a good idea.
01:35:44 Draw a fan art of us being murdered.
01:35:46 Yeah.
01:35:46 Yeah.
01:35:47 That'd be great.
01:35:47 Why is there no PCP porn yet?
01:35:49 It makes me so fucking mad.
01:35:51 Every single time I go on E621,
01:35:54 there's no Nate Bestman.
01:35:56 Like tag.
01:35:57 Oh, it's fucking nightmare.
01:35:58 What's wrong with you guys?
01:35:59 That's disgusting.
01:36:01 But also real real.
01:36:02 Are we not good enough for you?
01:36:03 Oh, what?
01:36:03 Game grumps gets poly grumps,
01:36:05 and we do get nothing.
01:36:06 We get the scrap, we get the shit.
01:36:07 We get the piss.
01:36:08 That's fair.
01:36:09 I can't wait till the,
01:36:10 there's eventually,
01:36:11 when the PCB dating sim comes out,
01:36:12 there will be an expansion pack,
01:36:14 if you know what I mean.
01:36:15 I'm expanding just thinking about
01:36:16 that expansion pack.
01:36:19 You know, it's going to be.
01:36:19 Oh, are you talking about the PCP DLC?
01:36:22 Oh, that's exactly what I'm talking about.
01:36:25 I can't wait.
01:36:26 Hey, was there more coming from the dating sim?
01:36:30 Yeah, they're still working on it.
01:36:31 They're still working on it.
01:36:32 Was there a date announced for that?
01:36:34 No, I think they said like September,
01:36:38 but I could be wrong about that.
01:36:39 I don't know if I'm,
