00:00:51 Reeeee!
00:00:54 All right, we're gonna talk about how much we hate fucking normies now. They all need to fucking burn in Auschwitz
00:00:59 We need to reopen Auschwitz and rename it normie Auschwitz, so they all fucking
00:01:04 Get out it all belong in the norm switch
00:01:07 Call it norm schwitz. Yeah, let's define what we mean by a normie. Okay. Hang on. They're gonna urban dictionary
00:01:14 I'm bringing this back
00:01:16 After I just made the greatest pun of all time and you deliberately ignored it until you can make your worst pun guy
00:01:22 I I just make it again. I said call it get out schwitz
00:01:31 That's a good one
00:01:32 I'm gonna get out of this
00:01:33 Urban dictionary right now because you've offended me greatly. Well, we'll be sorry to miss you. Yo, my infuror
00:01:40 I give that a nine out of ten
00:01:44 Okay, I don't even know what that means. Normie, a person who does not have a mental illness such as bipolar disorder
00:01:51 Schizophrenia mood disorders PTSD depression or any other similar mental disability wait
00:01:56 Wait, wait a reference to those who are a part of the mainstream culture the 97% of the population who doesn't have a mental illness
00:02:03 Okay, fuck urban dictionary. That's really a fucking normie. I didn't know what that was about. That's a normie definition if ever there was one
00:02:09 That's exactly right. This is a normative definition of normie and I don't appreciate the
00:02:13 Demonstricizing those fucking colonists fucking assholes because we don't identify with their their fucking identity politics over here on this fucking website
00:02:21 Fuck them there. They're they're on my shit list. Urban dictionary is dead. Let me let me make a let me make a thing here
00:02:27 My one of my favorite mangas ever Watamote. I mean, I forget what the word they use in Japanese
00:02:33 But the the main character in the English translation is always railing against normal fags
00:02:39 She has normal fags. Yes, because yeah, you know what the Japanese word is guy
00:02:44 There's a specific Japanese word for a person who lives a normal life. I mean no guys. It's just a foreigner
00:02:49 I don't know because white people are normal
00:02:52 And I'm gonna Google this I'm gonna come I'm gonna you guys continue the conversation
00:02:57 I'm gonna button and completely disrupt the flow and I find out what that's fine
00:03:00 But we can talk about what a motive cuz what a motive is the perfect example of what we're talking about because because fuck
00:03:05 I forget her name. What's her name?
00:03:07 Koko Riko no Tomoko Tomoko, right Tomoko is is is the greatest human being who's ever lived
00:03:14 Right, you just have to read her story to understand why everyone else is a fucking piece of shit
00:03:19 Who doesn't deserve to be in her companionship and all these all these psychosis psychotic breaks from reality
00:03:25 Are just her escaping to a higher plane which she has the ability to do because she's superior to everybody else
00:03:30 Okay, okay, I googled it and it looks like the phrase is Ria Jew which means people whose real life is fulfilled
00:03:38 Jew means Ria Jew. Okay, Jew. I think it's like an ending. It's like a prefix. It's a suffix that means person
00:03:45 I believe that would be gene. Oh, yeah, he's right. He's right. I don't know man. Whatever. It's the same shit
00:03:50 Whatever the point is there's a Japanese word for a people whose real life is fulfilled and she rails against the concept of them
00:03:57 And she's right because I mean there's people whose real life is fulfilled
00:04:00 And then there's the rest of us that turn to fucking anime and 2d and and and and all that and all that bullshit
00:04:08 Yeah, to fill the hole
00:04:11 To fill the hole that that that real life has left in our hearts
00:04:15 Yeah, that character that Tomoko character and then did you made a video about that Tomoko character and watching that video
00:04:22 Got me thinking about my life and I asked myself
00:04:25 Why did I always say weird stuff that made everyone mad or annoyed mostly?
00:04:31 And I think like fuck the blacks whites are the supreme race
00:04:36 It was for everyone would have agreed
00:04:40 Not really anyway the point is I really looked back on myself and I realized that it was just because I was bored
00:04:46 Everywhere I went I didn't have anything to say to these people
00:04:49 I could have had a normal social life with all of these people if I had been like all of them because you know
00:04:56 It starts off like this. Hey, hi. I'm David. Hi, and that's
00:05:00 David I just met you, but you're a fucking normie. So go now. Fuck you. Yes
00:05:05 I went down like you know what I just realized everyone will sit down and be like fucking topic that we hey
00:05:10 Would you what you know?
00:05:13 Oh, yeah, you know, I had a sandwich yesterday. Oh, yeah, I had a sandwich yesterday, too
00:05:18 That's normal life. That's real people right there sitting down at a table. They're like
00:05:24 But I'm sitting here
00:05:34 So now I'm sitting there at the table being like I don't care what sandwich you made
00:05:37 I try to get into interesting stuff like what's your favorite movie or what's your favorite something?
00:05:41 What are your thoughts on life all these interesting things and they don't answer respond to any of it
00:05:46 They're not receptive to any of it. Hey, bitch, let's fuck and she's like, you know, it's like fuck you, dude
00:05:55 You don't know me. What's up with that?
00:05:57 Let me stop you right there. Let me respond to the view in a more meaningful way
00:06:02 Okay, I can totally appreciate your your your desire to just say things that just upset people out of boredom, right?
00:06:11 People I was trying to get I was just trying to have something happen
00:06:15 Yeah, well, you're just trying to entertain
00:06:17 I don't know if I was if I was eating a meal with someone and they started spouting off some like what's your philosophy and what do you believe?
00:06:22 Shit, I'd be like shut up. I only have a go man. Yeah, Jesse
00:06:27 I'm with you. I mean, I mean much better much more carefully selected when I was younger
00:06:32 I had I wanted to like dive into deep concepts and like talk about meaningful shit all the time
00:06:39 But now that I'm a little bit older and a little bit wiser
00:06:41 I really think that all that stuff is just a bunch of bullshit
00:06:49 Not I didn't ask but I was just had to come up with an example geez I didn't ever ask what your philosophy
00:06:54 All right, well, that's what you said dude. That's what you fucking said and nor me right now
00:06:59 Right. Well, the point is I'm trying to have something interesting happen
00:07:02 Nothing happened that was ever interesting. It was boring and I hated it
00:07:06 And I'm now a socially normal person because I don't make myself go out and hang out with people who were boring for five
00:07:14 I'd like to quickly redefine normie as anyone that I dislike. Yeah, that's yeah, you know
00:07:18 Yeah, that's basically what it comes down. I mean, we're all here to rail against normies the concept of but really I mean
00:07:24 I have a normie story
00:07:26 It was not much but I was in the library the other day doing
00:07:30 the thing I do, you know Jack in my dick and
00:07:33 There's a guy behind me and I heard he was talking about video games
00:07:36 I was like, oh, that's cool. He's a video game guy, you know, because usually people are talking about normal bullshit
00:07:42 Yeah, and I was just sort of eavesdropping on him and then he was talking about yeah, I don't know about crash
00:07:49 You've seen that the naughty dogs you blah blah blah the last of us is really good
00:07:54 It's my favorite game ever and the new on-charted is amazing because it feels like you're playing a movie and I'm like
00:08:03 Truly get video games the highest they can aspire to is to be as good as a movie
00:08:07 What I was impressed just by the fact that he knew crash. I was gonna say yeah, that's kind of
00:08:14 I mean, how old was this guy? It was about my it's the library at my university. So it was about my age
00:08:22 I remember one episode of your let's play where you're talking about how like when you were a kid
00:08:26 Everyone was into Pokemon
00:08:27 But then one year later everyone got out of Pokemon and then in college
00:08:30 Everyone pretends to have not still loved Pokemon secretly where they'll go remember Pokemon
00:08:36 Remember back when we were kids who liked Pokemon. Yeah
00:08:39 But now we're the day when liking Pokemon is totally normalized so that people who don't even really give a shit about it
00:08:44 We'll say that they love Pokemon just so you know
00:08:47 It makes a complex situation being a normie, you know, they would be like tough. Yeah, this what were they called?
00:08:53 Pokeballs. I think that's what they were called. I don't
00:08:56 I don't care people as that as that nerds are just ahead of the curve man, you know
00:09:01 Yeah, I gotta I gotta get into this. All right. Okay. We got to figure out what the fuck what the fuck makes a normie
00:09:08 Yeah, I we're still like way
00:09:11 far away from
00:09:13 So look, okay, I think this is the difference. I think that I think the normal people I
00:09:20 Think that normal is is sort of something that that is performed and that people try to
00:09:25 Try to chase after it. I think most people look at what everyone else is doing and they sort of make themselves that
00:09:33 They listen to people like let's say you're overhearing a conversation where someone's like, haha
00:09:38 That guy's wearing cargo pants. What a nerd and then everyone goes, okay
00:09:43 Well mental note never wear cargo pants because it makes me a nerd. Yeah
00:09:47 But then there's people who are the the not normies who hear that and go what the fuck
00:09:53 But I like cargo pants and they keep wearing it anyway, and that's where you go off the beaten path and become the not normie
00:10:00 Yeah, I think that's something that that sort of happens as a result of either not understanding
00:10:07 What or why the normal people are doing what they're doing or not just not wanting to do it wait a minute like for me
00:10:13 I kind of just didn't get what the well where where those people were coming from, you know
00:10:18 Everyone was like what the fuck are you doing? You're wearing Pokemon shirts, and I'm like, yeah, Pokemon's cool, you know
00:10:23 Yeah, I mean at the end of the day that really is it like there's nothing like if you're wearing like a death note shirt
00:10:28 Okay, which I did death note is awesome death note is a really good serious
00:10:32 Especially if you're like yeah, and the thing is that though the people who everyone else around you the reason they're not wearing that shirt
00:10:38 Is that everyone else thinks it's not okay? Yeah, you know everyone else is like hey death
00:10:43 You're wearing a gay shirt, and you're like, you know
00:10:46 It's your kind of inability to process the idea that you need to change to be like everybody else
00:10:52 Everyone else I don't think that a normie is something like it's not something you can rigidly define like if you do this and this and this
00:10:59 You are a normie. I think that it comes in like aspects like everybody has normally things about them
00:11:05 Like normie is like porn. There's no definition, but you know it when you see it. That's true
00:11:10 Well, that's true what I'm getting is that like everyone is a normie in some ways like
00:11:16 Like my fucking like my friend Dylan who's been like my friends in high school
00:11:20 I know for a fact. He's a fucking freak. He used to fucking he used to like like stand around on the farm naked and fucking
00:11:29 Two tribal dances and shit and fucking swim out into into the middle of a puddle in like a fucking box like a canoe
00:11:39 In the middle of a puddle, okay, yeah, he's a fucking he's a fucking freak man
00:11:43 But but he also has like a normal you're referring to Lake Erie when you say a puddle. Yeah, yeah, okay
00:11:50 Just check him so like so in some ways, you know
00:11:52 He's just as big of a fucking weirdo and a nerd as me
00:11:55 But in other ways he has a normal job and stuff and kind of a normal life
00:11:59 He lives in an apartment with his girlfriend. So in that way, they're filthy degenerate. Yeah
00:12:05 Yeah, there's sometimes is like a wedge between me and the rest of the world
00:12:08 I mean, I gotta try to I gotta make what the hell is wrong with you
00:12:12 I'm talking up. I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve here. I'm sorry, Jesse. I'm trying to understand
00:12:18 I'm picking up what you're throwing down. Jesse. I want to fight just can't wait to get in there with something
00:12:24 Jesse, I'm gonna ask you a fucking question. All right
00:12:27 Let's hear it Jesse. I want to spice up this conversation by asking you and everyone else eventually
00:12:35 Do you feel sometimes that you are either to normie or not normie enough?
00:12:40 Well, that's what I was just fucking getting to but yeah, well, I wanted to make it a topic
00:12:46 So I knew you were going there go for it
00:12:49 I'll don't be a bitch
00:12:52 Flustered and flung I have a counter question. I do I do feel like no tofu fuck you Jesse has to answer my question first
00:13:01 Do you feel sometimes that you're either to normie or not normie enough in everyday life
00:13:08 Nobody answer this as if you're talking about your prior self talk about right now
00:13:14 Yes, okay as I was saying before did you ruined it for like a 20 minute train wreck just then
00:13:22 Because of what I do
00:13:24 My norminess has gone so drastically down
00:13:27 To the point where there's a like an even greater wedge between me and the rest of humanity than there ever was before
00:13:33 But like I remember in the years right after high school. Yes, where I was doing good
00:13:37 I would wagger around I talked to girls and stuff
00:13:39 I was young and hot and but then I started doing this YouTube shit
00:13:43 And then I just turned into this mutant that you see before you today
00:13:46 And now it's like like the thing about this job is that you can't relate to anyone in the world because if you work in customer service
00:13:53 And you complain about it. Everybody is with you because everybody's worked in customer service. I cannot
00:14:00 Even talk about my job because nobody understands anything about what I do
00:14:05 It's so weird and the worst is when people pretend that they do understand. That's pretty fucking annoying
00:14:10 Yeah, just if if you're a youtuber try explaining to someone else like what a copyright strike is and they're just like oh man
00:14:18 Like they're just like are you in trouble? Is that like it's like just fucking forget about it. Like I'll tell you like and I like I like
00:14:25 Like sometimes like I'll catch myself being not normie enough like I'll
00:14:31 Like sometimes I'll just be sitting don't want to go down into that place
00:14:34 I'll be minding my own business and suddenly like
00:14:36 Like it'll all hit me that the stuff that I usually ignore about how fucked up my life is that I just don't notice because I'm not a normie like I
00:14:45 Don't have a car right now. I don't have a phone. I haven't had a phone for six months. My life is in shambles
00:14:51 No, I haven't had a phone for like six months
00:14:53 I I live in a fucking dump and it's like I don't even notice these things because my life is
00:15:00 Creativity, it's what I do for my job and it's what I do for my hobby. So when I get distracted from my job
00:15:04 I'm still doing my fucking job. I it's all I do is just I make weird stuff
00:15:10 I'm living this weird artist lifestyle. That's the quintessential non-normie lifestyle
00:15:15 And I feel like a fucking normie
00:15:18 It's a spectrum my friend it's a spectrum because of that
00:15:21 I don't have a reason to usually go anywhere
00:15:24 I don't have a reason to call anyone because I hate people anyways. I don't like going out. I fucking I hate everything in the world
00:15:30 So but then like I'll catch myself like hey, wait a minute. Isn't it weird that I don't have a car?
00:15:35 Isn't it weird that I don't have a phone? Yeah, I guess it kind of is pretty fucked up
00:15:39 How did I get to this point, you know, Jesse brief
00:15:43 Yeah, I know what you sometimes I feel like a normie, but then I just look over at my Nico Robin statue and I'm just like
00:15:58 Both Ben and Jesse were saying like cuz I brought this up because I was interested to know
00:16:03 Dude, I can look up her dress right now
00:16:05 Jesse Jesse was saying that he mostly worries about being not normie enough
00:16:08 I have concerns about being too normie sometimes and it's mostly when I hang out like with Jesse because Jesse is
00:16:16 So
00:16:17 Unhinged and doesn't care and in ways that like well like when I'm in
00:16:22 When I'm in public especially like I I guess because I grew up very like rigidly following the rules
00:16:28 You know, I was never something like not the social rules
00:16:31 But like the rules of like the law kind of you always go pretty normie when you're out and about doing shit
00:16:36 Yeah, well, I just haven't I'm like very afraid of like breaking laws
00:16:40 Like I was just raised in a way to like I you know, I'm extremely conscious about that kind of stuff even in like minor circumstances
00:16:47 so like if we're at brony con or something and
00:16:50 We're on you know on top of the the building up there. Yeah, and Jesse's like going over the railing and I'm like
00:16:56 Come back
00:17:00 It's really not a big deal and if anything I wish I was the one over there doing that
00:17:08 Leaning over a railing Jesse's fucking unhinged
00:17:11 Well, you
00:17:22 Well see that's what I'm talking about Jesse you don't care about those things that means nothing to you in my mind
00:17:28 All these alarm bells go off because I'm like that's where the rules are that's like that's the law mark that line in the sand
00:17:35 You know that arbitrary marker is where the law ends and begins and in my brain
00:17:40 It's like we are now breaking the law. Maybe we should take a step back, you know, but I wish I was the one going over that
00:17:48 I don't think that rules are for cowards, right?
00:17:51 And that applies socially as well. I do too, which is why I feel too normie when I follow the rules that strictly, right?
00:17:57 And Jesse is why I like being drunk in public because then I don't care anymore. That's that's definitely true
00:18:02 Gibbon was saying just the other day
00:18:03 I don't even remember this but he was saying that when we all met up at Brony con like one of the first things
00:18:07 I did was that I just when we laid in our when we went to our hotel
00:18:10 I just started humping him, which I have no memory
00:18:15 Thing because it just devolved it just dissolved the tension and I'm always thinking that I wish I would do more of that shit
00:18:25 That's what I'm talking about. Well, that's yeah, that's the thing like every time Jesse talks about him and his friends all like showing each other
00:18:33 Like I I feel I feel wrong that I'm not doing that
00:18:37 Yeah, like that I would be so prudish as to like when we all shared a hotel room
00:18:42 Yeah, you know, I avoid if Jesse was in the shower
00:18:46 I made sure I didn't go into the bathroom even though I might have had to piss because there was like the bath the fucking tub
00:18:51 Is right next to a shower. I mean, this is why I love stories like the d-club story so much
00:18:56 It's like yeah, these guys are so free. I have a genuine
00:18:59 Of right, you know, yeah, I was just thinking I was like we all need to get it
00:19:03 We all need to get together and do some cock handshakes. Yes, it's like a handshake, but you grab each other's dick
00:19:16 You know, I hadn't thought of it like that until you said something you know, that's the danger
00:19:26 It's just a cock handshake
00:19:29 Don't get hard I'm gonna tell my therapist in 10 years. Yeah, it was just a cock handshake doctor
00:19:36 Martinovic and 10 years later you're you're
00:19:43 Ideally a cock handshake should be the length of a normal handshake
00:19:46 It shouldn't go on for like some handshakes. Well, it's pretty long and be pretty satisfying. But all right
00:19:51 All right, so on the subject on back on topic. Yeah, it should be like one of those like like like like secret handshakes
00:19:57 Like where it's really complicated
00:20:04 Some handshakes got to involve the mouth a little bit, you know
00:20:10 All right, what do you back on topic? I want to say that in I don't really consider myself
00:20:16 That normie but like you said before guy. It's on a spectrum right like in a lot of ways
00:20:20 I am normie like you know, I kind of have sex with girls, you know
00:20:25 Ultimate normie act you can commit it is a shame other than marrying them
00:20:28 Marrying them is the normiest thing you can do, you know
00:20:31 Like I I meet girls and stuff and like I go and like I talk to people and like absolutely shameful
00:20:36 I behave like a generally
00:20:38 Functional member of society on the other hand like I don't have a regular job and like a lot of my income comes from like
00:20:44 Creativity and stuff and like my room my roommates see me as this totally weird
00:20:50 Out there, you know kind of goofy character. Yeah
00:20:54 Oh, so you're that guy to them, huh? I don't I don't see myself as like a crazy wacky person
00:20:59 But they see me as just this like impossible
00:21:01 Confluence of like weird that's cool trades. Yeah, like they're really fascinated by my and they're like, oh, didn't you?
00:21:07 Didn't you make money by making pony videos?
00:21:12 What the fuck
00:21:14 Com we don't make videos anymore
00:21:17 And
00:21:19 Everybody pledged to the t-bat patreon on patreon.com slash endless Jess so like so like compared so like compared to my roommates
00:21:27 I'm a complete like they're so normie next to me, but like compared to Jesse. I feel like a total normie
00:21:33 I know like I still have have a phone and like
00:21:38 That's another one of those awareness moment for me because when you say it like that
00:21:42 It really doesn't sound like I've become an insane hermit. I mean, I have functional kidneys
00:21:48 I'm living the normal life the normal lifestyle right now. You know, I I sleep on a bed. That's made out of a bed and not garbage
00:21:59 My bed's not in a bed frame like a like a true normie sleeps in a bed in a bed frame
00:22:04 But at least it's a bed and not like a pile of dish right
00:22:08 The frame because I went fuck that yeah, mine also is not in the frame
00:22:12 You know, I can't help but wonder if if it makes it like even less normie that I have like a Casper mattress
00:22:19 That I bought because it's like a podcast recommended it to me like
00:22:24 Does but on the spectrum it's it's it's less weird than having no bed and sleeping on trash as Jesse
00:22:30 Yeah, I don't know. It's funny. I I feel I I kind of a similar status with my friends where I'm like the weird guy
00:22:37 But a lot of them were at least as weird as me until after like they got jobs and like became more
00:22:46 Yeah, yeah, like to to make to make a living in a normal way. You kind of have to become a normie
00:22:52 Yeah, I can get I mean I work a nine-to-five every day of the week
00:22:55 I must super normie and I like no challenging that notion right and then again
00:23:00 By the way, I I really hope that this podcast comes across as like funny and self-aware and not like the most
00:23:07 Autistic thing that's ever happened, but I hope we'll have to we've got a
00:23:12 Let it let it be known that we we understand that
00:23:17 Awareness of normie is like it's totally relative. Yeah
00:23:25 Definitely like the term normie is almost a misnomer because I feel like I'm the only normal fucking person on this planet
00:23:32 I know right when you see those YouTube comments, but yeah, like you know
00:23:37 Like among my friends man like one of my best friends is a dude who when I met him was a
00:23:43 Full-on Hikikomri who hadn't left his room in like years
00:23:47 He was like pissing in bottles and shit because of paranoia and stuff like that
00:23:52 Clarissa
00:23:56 Thousands of anime like he's seen he's seen way more than I ever have and that's saying something
00:24:01 Yeah, I'm known to be a man who's watched a lot of anime, you know
00:24:05 He he had this because he had something called cluster headaches were like every morning at like 6 a.m
00:24:10 He'd get an intense migraine that lasts like a couple hours and as a result
00:24:14 He couldn't come to school most of the time
00:24:16 And the only times he came was like on the first couple days of the year and it just so happens that one day
00:24:21 He was reading like a lucky star book at school
00:24:24 Yeah, yeah, there was a show that no one had heard of at the time if you weren't like well
00:24:28 2006 or 7 or something 2007 yeah, so I started talking to him based on that and like got his
00:24:33 You know his instant messenger handle right before he left school entirely. Yeah, the last day
00:24:38 He was there so me and him became friends and like you know
00:24:41 This is a guy who is about as as weird as it gets right? He's locked himself in his room all he does is watch anime
00:24:47 He's got like Daki Makura pillows everywhere on his fucking walls
00:24:50 He was like he's always slept on the floor just cuz he's a big fat guy and like
00:24:55 He's got like that's he has like bad snoring that like you can hear for like like like yards and
00:25:02 Like you can hear it forever
00:25:04 Yeah, he won't sleep over at people's houses because his snoring is so loud that he'll keep you up like
00:25:09 He's just got a lot of odd traits
00:25:10 But then over time he you know and he would he was like a terrified of talking to people
00:25:15 We'd go out to like fast food and I'd have to order for him, you know
00:25:18 Oh, I couldn't talk to people like that
00:25:20 But over time this dude has gotten to be so normal because like he started working out losing weight doing diets and stuff
00:25:28 He started talking to people he got a normal job
00:25:30 You know, he's been for almost two years now. He's been like moving cars working for my dad and like now
00:25:36 He's like a completely normal guy all he does is like talk about cars and fucking
00:25:40 Oh, I didn't know this was the guy who one of your friends who started working for your dad. That's awesome
00:25:44 I'm glad he's doing that. Yeah, he he's yeah
00:25:47 He's got a complete he went to college for a couple years on like, you know scholarships and stuff because he's like
00:25:51 He's like yeah, but like now he's like so normie that like I try to talk to him about weird stuff
00:26:00 And he's kind of like he can barely, you know, like he's the only one of my friends who can still like get to that place
00:26:07 And be like yeah, I get where you're coming from
00:26:09 And this is the fundamental difference between even most weird people and those of us in this chat right now
00:26:14 Yeah, right if I it's not just what situation you're in
00:26:18 It's the core of what you want out of reality out of your life
00:26:22 And where does it bring you because I think all of us
00:26:25 Yeah, all of us are gonna either like live off our art or die in a gutter something like that
00:26:30 I don't know. We're all people well Jesse
00:26:35 Shamefully for me. I'm living the plan B lifestyle right now fine
00:26:39 Which is which makes me ashamed of myself, but I'm doing it, you know, I like to I like to have a house
00:26:44 I'd like to go back to have a part-time job if he needed it for food
00:26:48 But he hasn't had a part-time job in a while
00:26:50 So I don't trust I mean frankly frankly my job
00:26:52 I've got is so good and I'm expecting like a promotion in a couple months like the amount of work the amount of money
00:26:59 I'll need to make to like equal or even come close to like achieving what I'm doing now
00:27:03 It's good is like puts the level of like my patron. I'll need to get you to go full-time at like so high
00:27:09 It's probably making it harder for me to break away. Yeah. Well anyway, yeah
00:27:14 In response to my my
00:27:16 Willingness to go back to work like yeah, if I did go back
00:27:19 It would always be with the idea that I'm going to get out again, right?
00:27:23 Yeah, I got a job the first time under the impression that I was gonna work until I could afford I think it's safe to say that all of us have
00:27:30 Found a legitimate passion in our lives that we're looking to pursue, you know, right?
00:27:34 I mean phrase is better. I didn't phrase it bad. I now want to phrase it better
00:27:38 Most people who are in some sort of weird situation like being locked in their room
00:27:42 We're having a huge medical problem. They are fundamentally drawn to being normal some day and maybe they'll succeed
00:27:48 Maybe most of them succeed, but but for me personally
00:27:52 No matter how normal of a situation. I'm in I am drawn away from it
00:27:56 Like I could right now be like that's true
00:27:59 We can attest to to DeVu not being into having a job whatsoever. He's I well
00:28:03 I gotta I gotta address the guy who's been quiet here Tom who?
00:28:08 Flew just just got back from having flown from like Boston to Vancouver
00:28:13 Yeah, and stayed there for a month and a half with his internet girlfriend
00:28:17 How normally do you feel Tom good question?
00:28:19 Um, I honestly I've been so silent because I don't think about any of this like my social standings or how normally you're on
00:28:26 Normie I'm doing my I don't buy that for one fucking second. I don't know I know you're judging everybody
00:28:31 Don't you don't you take the same perverse pride that we all do
00:28:35 I mean
00:28:37 I know for me that like I can't hold a job like I've told like
00:28:42 Everyone like it's my my family's like because I live with my family still and I make like pittance
00:28:46 I make pennies on the dollar that I used to like right years ago on the internet and they're like pony days, man
00:28:52 You need to get a job, but I'm just like no and they're like why is like because I will probably kill myself
00:28:57 Well, I have a question for you. It's probably the most not normie question ever
00:29:02 Do you feel blame? Are you mad?
00:29:05 Do you feel like who's kebab rath rannage your franage pooch-gooch-booch-google your rammage jiggy-jiggy
00:29:12 Google
00:29:16 What's being said
00:29:19 Even more like to do the what the in the have more like to do if that's not how it goes, you know
00:29:25 Tom
00:29:30 Have you ever been want to do more look like that's the one well Tom brought up killing himself and really isn't that the way to?
00:29:36 Not be a normie truly
00:29:39 Living is so fucking normal
00:29:44 Dude that was a guy it was like this Jewish guy at MIT. He wrote like a thousand page. He wrote his PhD thesis
00:29:51 It was a thousand page manifesto on like Jewish mysticism and like I'm like the subject of life as like an abstract concept
00:29:59 Yeah, and his final conclusion was that life and death are both fundamentally equivalent to each other
00:30:04 I then like the next day
00:30:05 He went out in public and like put on a tuxedo and just like shot himself in the head
00:30:09 I have someone in front of like in front of like a tour group at MIT and you know
00:30:16 Work that guy was too normie for his own good
00:30:19 You know speak of normie
00:30:21 I mean this this very this very channel you're watching this video on right now
00:30:25 I made sure that I was the one who made it and would be financially
00:30:29 Responsible for it in the instance. They were ever to take off and be successful. So just so you know
00:30:35 I'm always thinking about the shit Machiavellian style in case one of these one of these things is to take off
00:30:40 I want to be the guy who's gonna make the most because I'm here to sabotage it from within well my goal
00:30:45 To make sure none of these guys ever become normies and surpass me in life
00:30:49 I did that with teabag and I made sure I to do it again with with the procrastinator
00:30:53 Tom reminded me because he mentioned work living at home like that the hardest thing for me about trying like if I even
00:31:00 Wanted to try to be normie. It's impossible because my living environment is so fucking bizarre
00:31:06 That like it can't happen like I mean aside for the fact that my room itself is giant and covered in posters on every inch
00:31:15 Which I can't I can't escape it now like I've put so much like you said you were going to only over my bed
00:31:21 And there's a bunch of sexy anime girls over my bed
00:31:23 And so now even if I want to like think about something else
00:31:27 I look at my ceiling and I'm just like I guess I'm jacking off the anime girls tonight
00:31:31 You surround yourself with the ideal and I want but uh, that's not a good point
00:31:35 is
00:31:37 How even if we like made an effort to be normie how normie could any of us
00:31:43 Is something that you can wheel yourself to do a suit and got like a normal job and live the normal life
00:31:48 I would still essentially be the same guy who fucking punches teenagers in the movie theater
00:31:55 And that's right family is alcoholics, you know when addicts of all of us
00:31:59 Yes, I think you're the least willing to hold on. Let me finish ready. Okay, my story
00:32:03 Cuz like you guys have seen what the inside of my house looks like right that
00:32:08 My living room is literally a castle. I know but in fight I saw it in that monopoly money music video
00:32:15 Yeah, yeah, it's been in a few videos there. The entire living room is a castle my
00:32:21 Like you can't you can't just like live in there and think like this is a house
00:32:26 It's impossible like you go in there and you're like what the fuck do I live in this is madness, you know
00:32:32 And my my brother Victor because Victor is like the guy who's trying to escape and become the normie guy, right?
00:32:39 Right, he's like a you know like in the in the boys in the hood
00:32:44 In boys in the hood where there was the one kid who wanted to go to college and escape the gangster life
00:32:49 Yeah, yeah, that's Victor. He's trying to get out of here go to LA
00:32:53 He's just too gangster, right well, but it's funny though because like
00:32:57 Compared like we all always say like oh Victor's going to become the most normie guy of all because he does work that deals with other people
00:33:04 And it's like a job that already exists
00:33:06 But filmmaking is the most not normie job before we existed like up until the existence of you of YouTube and people making up their
00:33:15 Own jobs out of thin air like we did like nothing was less normie than going off to Hollywood to become an artist
00:33:21 But like from our perspective it's like oh Victor's gonna go be the normie one
00:33:25 But he's always talking about like how for him
00:33:27 it's hard to like get into the mindset of being an adult because of the fact that he lives at home in a home that is so like
00:33:35 It's so massive and so like
00:33:39 Over-decorated and designed where like you know my mom's office is nothing but toys because she's like a toy collector
00:33:44 You know our living rooms a fucking castle my room is full of posters
00:33:48 You can't go anywhere in this house and just feel like a normal guy. It's impossible
00:33:53 You know my parents aren't really that like my dad is super normie, but my mom is not very
00:33:58 Normie, you know, so yeah, so you can't escape it. It's and even though my dad is super normie
00:34:04 He's also the guy who made it a fucking castle, so he's not that he's still got his own
00:34:09 He's guilty of conspiracy to commit and apparently he has like a huge
00:34:13 Exhaustive memory of movies because he just remembers all the movies he watches. Yeah, that's pretty not mine between
00:34:19 I don't know. I think that's more normie than you think I think I think a lot of people can
00:34:23 Movies are very normie these days
00:34:25 I think the line between normie and not normie is really thin and I think it's getting even thinner right
00:34:30 And I think even today like I think even in the past everyone had sort of like this pop cultural
00:34:38 Sensibility about the most everyone was to some degree tuned into like you know movies and music and like art stuff
00:34:44 That is not exactly no
00:34:45 It's not it's not normie like going to work nine to five is normie
00:34:48 Yeah, and you know like drinking in bars is normie, but it's not it's not I think the internet is slowly blowing the doors off
00:34:54 Yeah, and yeah, that's the thing and I mean now it is stuff like us is accessible to people to stuff
00:34:59 Right who aren't yeah culture is more accessible to everyone
00:35:03 So everyone's more exposed to it and just the whole the whole thing about like nerd culture like the whole nerd pride thing
00:35:09 And how being a nerd is cool now like I think today
00:35:12 The normiest thing you can be is like a little bit not normie, you know
00:35:17 Not
00:35:21 It's niche to be just a straightforward like corporate guy now, that's it's only square
00:35:35 Like normie get less and less normie until the point where like we're normie
00:35:46 The internet is causing like every group that exists was a kind of kind of existed in its own little circle
00:35:52 But the internet's allowing people to form smaller and smaller communities of like many people like us that
00:35:59 People even more to bring it out to like a broader perspective, you know like we all grew up on
00:36:05 Cartoons that would show high school or or even TV shows that would show high school is like this very like
00:36:12 Fragmented like here's the jocks. Here's the the the nerds
00:36:15 Here's the Goths, you know, like that's how you should always be presented and for a lot of places in America
00:36:20 Especially in middle America
00:36:21 It's still like very much like that where people still get beat up for being gay or get beat up for this and that you know
00:36:27 like for being nerds and stuff, but like
00:36:30 At the high school I went to all the clicks had kind of bled together like everybody knew someone in another
00:36:37 Click like we had we had a bunch of skater kids who stood around and a bunch of goth kids who stood around
00:36:41 But they weren't like enemies. They kind of knew each other and yeah, that's true
00:36:48 Clicks weren't that code they really weren't they really and it was largely because like Facebook had made it so everybody
00:36:54 Knows what's going on with everybody else anyways, so I don't know
00:36:57 There was Facebook so much as they didn't really exist that much in the reality
00:37:02 Facebook only became a thing like after we got to call like like right when we were going to college and it was like college
00:37:08 Well, you say Nate that it wasn't a thing ever, but I don't know cuz like
00:37:13 Tropes that were
00:37:19 Not a lot of people on forums who have told who like are from the Midwest who have made it sound like they're high school like super was
00:37:25 Okay, well me and then we're on we're in Massachusetts, so I mean
00:37:29 There's and we're from big cities, so like it's a little more small town, but nonetheless east coast. Yeah, but yeah
00:37:36 I think this coast is a little bit because we have like I guess the best way to put it is we have a lot of black people and
00:37:42 Like I think the fact that we're not racist has a lot to do with you
00:37:46 That's true of you me and Ben went to a pro almost entirely white school
00:37:50 They were like a couple Asians couple black people here and now you hate
00:37:54 And yeah, now we're super racist as a result, of course
00:37:58 But the the the thing about that is that like it's true
00:38:05 We do I mean I mean I mean I knew from like I
00:38:09 Knew culture like culturally. I was told that racism was bad. I just didn't get very much
00:38:16 Let's just talk about clicks, you know, we're talking about you know being an army and like at our school
00:38:21 Like I remember pretty much everyone. I went to school very well
00:38:24 And there really was like at the very like there were opportunities to join whichever click you wanted to the thing
00:38:30 Is that when you're a high schooler you're super retarded and you don't know what the fuck you're doing with your life
00:38:34 If you wanted to join a click it would be super easy
00:38:37 You just need to put in a tiny amount of effort to like express interest in whatever they're doing and show that you're not a
00:38:43 Complete fuck-up, but I mean those high schools are not capable of that
00:38:46 I felt like a fucking insane person in high school because I I looked at all the clicks and I didn't get it like I didn't get well
00:38:52 I hung out with the goth kids, but they all actually looked like
00:38:56 Goth kids. They actually wore the makeup. They actually
00:38:59 Was a kid I hung out with the goth kids, too. I was the least gothie of the goth
00:39:04 Yeah, that was I was in with I was the guy real goths. I mean I had I had bondage pants from hot topic
00:39:13 Did you hang on Ben did at one point write a letter to game informer explaining why goth culture was legit
00:39:21 That's not what my letter to game informer was about my letter to game informer was about that
00:39:26 I really liked the Wheel of Time series and I really wanted them to fucking
00:39:31 Whether there were any video game tie-ins coming out since you hung out with that click
00:39:35 Did you ever read Johnny the homicidal maniac? No, I was not I was not aware of that and so
00:39:41 this was hilarious to me right because I
00:39:43 In high school I hung out with that goth click and it was all all kids, you know who dressed the part they
00:39:48 They had my my chemical romance. They had the all-black. Yeah, they had the my chemical romance shirts
00:39:52 They have the you know
00:39:53 They listened to those bands and went to those shows and stuff like that
00:39:55 They were all fucking potheds to at least half of them
00:39:58 And I was the one who was like I was I was over there
00:40:01 You know with those guys hanging out with like the nerdier ones because there was a lot of overlap between nerds and goths in my school
00:40:06 You know, yeah, like so I was at the nerdy goth kids and I just dressed like a fucking freak
00:40:11 I had like my my super long hair that went down to my ass
00:40:13 I had the scraggly ass horrible beard the fucking like random anime t-shirts and shit dirty ass clothes
00:40:20 And I smelled like farts, but ripped apart leaking. So I had to plug it
00:40:26 So one of those goth kids one time gave me
00:40:31 One of those goth kids let me read Johnny the homicidal maniac
00:40:35 And it was really funny because the whole thing is a criticism of like click culture
00:40:40 It's all about how much Joan and Vazquez hates God
00:40:42 Yeah, like all of the goth kids absolutely love Johnny the homicidal maniac because they all think they're the good ones
00:40:53 I'm like, how did the person who loaned me this not understand they are exactly what this is about
00:41:07 We are self-aware in this chat right and almost no one else is in the universe
00:41:12 It's like no one else knows what we know we're the smartest people in the world
00:41:16 We're fucking geniuses. Listen, listen, there's a pair. There's a parallel. There's a there's an idea forming idea eating in my neurons
00:41:24 It's like we here talking about this are like Joan and Vazquez
00:41:28 Pointing out that we everyone including ourselves is all just pretending and we're all and by you know the goth sit around talking about the
00:41:36 Preps and how and how foolish they are, but they don't realize how foolish they look not realizing that they themselves
00:41:46 The goths and the vampires and the emos were all calling one another posers and so they
00:41:52 They got the ghost of Edgar Allen Poe. Yeah reanimated and he called all of them posers
00:41:57 He would he would he's the biggest record. I don't think I think we have shown that there is a level on which we admire
00:42:04 Norminess and yeah, true and like we're more we're not so much saying that being
00:42:10 respect for normies
00:42:12 Like I mean I I would never completely reject norminess. I mean
00:42:17 I think we're distinguishing ourselves without saying that we're necessarily better for being I see I see normies
00:42:22 And I see like something that I could never be but that like it's like a normal person looking at like Superman or something, right?
00:42:30 Normies are truly superior. Yeah, I think that maybe I think maybe there's no such thing as a true normie
00:42:36 I think that normie nest absolutely correct is like it's like a platonic ideal
00:42:40 Yes, and there is some like hypothetical theoretical perfect normie archetype
00:42:45 But no one right when we recognize traits of norminess and people we can call them a normie
00:42:50 I've come to realize I
00:42:52 Think I just understood why I can't be normie was that I think that if I tried I would always come back to
00:42:59 Because if you try we'd reject you if you ever have you ever read the book The Stranger
00:43:04 absolutely by Camus of course yeah, or
00:43:07 Alternatively seen the play waiting for God. Oh that the stranger was about a guy who was the biggest
00:43:13 Non-normie of all so hard that he had to murder everyone the guy's way think about he only killed one
00:43:18 He only think about the guy for the stranger is that from his perspective
00:43:24 Nothing he did was that weird, you know, he was just like I went to my mother's funeral
00:43:29 I didn't really feel like crying so he didn't cry
00:43:33 Yeah, and then later on he just kind of ends up killing a guy
00:43:36 And then they use the fact that he didn't cry at his mom's funeral against the sense him
00:43:39 Yeah, and then like he's you know getting executed at the end and he kind of has like this breakdown where he's like
00:43:44 I don't understand like I don't get what has happened here, and he's just like I feel you know distant from it
00:43:52 The play waiting for God. Oh meanwhile is about these two guys waiting for a good dough waiting for good
00:43:58 Oh
00:43:59 They go out they go out to this bench every day, and they're waiting for God. Oh, and they
00:44:05 Can't say that good. Oh, it's easy
00:44:08 It's fucking
00:44:10 Talking about how they're gonna kill themselves or about how they're gonna do this and that or about how this whatever's gonna happen
00:44:15 But the point is they just go out every day and nothing fucking up waiting for gay dough
00:44:19 It's there always just waiting around guy, which is like I feel like whatever I don't ever think of like
00:44:25 But if I think of the idea of becoming
00:44:27 Enormy like all those like absurdist ideas flood into my head, and I'm just like what is the meaning of anything like why?
00:44:33 Like I could die tomorrow, and none of this will matter like putting effort into being anything is is like meaningless
00:44:40 Putting it oh that ties right into our last podcast where we talked about this very topic
00:44:44 Yeah, the idea of trying to create a self-identity is so strange to me like like nothing that I am right is like something
00:44:51 I went after being that guy
00:44:54 Wasted effort come objective
00:44:58 The way I keep my hair and beard is because I'm too lazy to get it cut and then when I cut it
00:45:04 It just all goes you know it's like there's no there's no sense of like crafting a self
00:45:08 It's myself is like the untethered expression of what interests me at the time
00:45:12 It just so happens I've been into cartoons since I was a kid, and I love writing about them
00:45:17 So that's why I write about anime. It's not like I'm trying to create this this idea of myself as the the anime guy
00:45:23 It's just like that's what I am the anime man has that in the market cornered
00:45:27 You know no challenge that guy um
00:45:29 But yeah like to me like if I try if I think about like what if I tried to create a self-image and like become this person
00:45:37 And then it's like you could spend like a year doing that and like getting towards this this eventuality
00:45:42 And then get hit by a truck and die and then like the universe is meaningless
00:45:46 Why are you trying to do anything just like live by your?
00:45:49 By your instinct you know yeah like I want to like live on my own
00:45:53 I want to like have a relationship
00:45:55 I want to have a car and I want to have
00:45:57 Disposed I want to have a relationship those things with standards because those things are desirable. I want them
00:46:02 Yeah, like I wouldn't I would not mind having all those things
00:46:06 But I I and I and I also think if you're working towards it
00:46:09 That's not the same thing as being normie is just being goal-driven, you know
00:46:13 I think yeah, I think the more normie attitude would be the the the girl who like gets knocked up and then keeps the baby
00:46:19 And marries the guy even though they have no love for each other because it's just
00:46:30 Yeah, I just sort of consider that to be like one of the most like one of the most intense expressions of norminess
00:46:36 Like because like I have older cousins who get married like they're all female they get like two of them
00:46:41 Like right I feel you on this fuck them well like
00:46:45 Yeah, I have these two older cousins who've gotten like who are like in their 30s now
00:46:49 And they've gotten like oh, I would definitely have sex with them or married like a
00:46:54 Bunch load of times. It's always just like to some generic guy with like tattoos. I'm like this looks like
00:47:02 And with tattoos
00:47:11 It just seems like that seems like the most normie thing like one of the most intense expressions
00:47:17 The quintessential focus point of being normie is to not be self-critical not be self analytical
00:47:23 Is that what we talk about the saddest outcome that I think most like normies have
00:47:32 This is what happened to like
00:47:34 Everyone on my mom's side of family like all my all my aunts and uncles like they they started off like living
00:47:41 The normie life right like they got made they had kids and then at some point everything went horribly wrong
00:47:46 But they stuck with them. They know that here's the thing in their minds
00:47:51 They're still like a part of that like that that's still who they are. They're still like normal
00:47:56 Yeah, but they're totally not at all like there are a bunch of fucking weirdos like you know my aunt like
00:48:03 Went crazy and just like now all she does is smoke weed constantly and like and
00:48:08 Weird diet, but like in her mind
00:48:10 She is a normal person who is like trying to get you know like oh my life is gonna be back on track soon
00:48:17 You know, it's like it's never happening. You're you've lost your mind somewhere along the line
00:48:21 You don't get that. Yeah, I think that's what happens to a lot of like
00:48:24 I don't know maybe it's just in my family
00:48:26 But like I know a lot of people who are like in their 50s and have it
00:48:29 The other shoe hasn't dropped and they haven't realized that their life is totally not normal
00:48:33 They still think that they're working towards like getting stability back, but it's never coming back
00:48:39 Yeah, I think of all these like failed relationships as a super normie expression is because it's like they're doing it because
00:48:45 I mean, I understand if you have specific reasons like a pregnancy happened
00:48:48 But if you're doing it just for like just to do it it really shows this weird conformity of yeah
00:48:54 Oh, I'm kind of like doing that because like that's what's socially accepted like I'd even say happen like not having an abortion
00:49:00 Even when it's obviously the thing to do in your particular circumstance is just is a very normie thing to do
00:49:06 You know
00:49:09 See it sounds like you're like a thousand feet from the microphone suddenly what
00:49:14 Sounds like you're all the way across the room
00:49:18 Well, I don't know the stats on that I I mean I could have been told either way getting an abortion
00:49:25 I'm just saying that like to do things without
00:49:28 Like when I was like that's what being a normie is when I was seven
00:49:33 I had learned the statistic that half of marriages end in divorce and I know right
00:49:37 Well, then clearly I'm only going to do it when I'm like at least 98 percent sure that it's gonna work out
00:49:43 But so right we'll just go into it. It's like didn't you see the stat? What else would you do that had a 50%?
00:49:51 That you have to that you have to do this thing because it's expected of you
00:49:58 Intense norminess right just just the other day. I was lying on the floor in a depressed stupor
00:50:04 Regretting every decision. I made in my life up to that point and I just thought to myself
00:50:07 You know what you were pulling a naps to blue. That's right at that moment
00:50:10 I thought to myself you know what you know what I could get married
00:50:13 I could give myself to someone just you know and be done with it, but then as soon as I stopped doing that
00:50:17 I realized that's a terrible idea. I think that's where it comes from
00:50:22 Normies have no hope and nothing to live for and that's exactly depressed because they're why I mean
00:50:26 So I mean we all we all we hear all live for our art right true
00:50:31 We all we all live for our creative outlets and for the purpose of creating something that you know will impact people and
00:50:38 Maybe you know stand the test of time and and and and continue on. Yeah
00:50:42 I'm all that and pussy on my face. You know what I'm fucking saying guys
00:50:49 But yeah pussy just no no no shut up shut up fuckers
00:50:53 And fucking the the point is most people don't have that yeah, that's true
00:50:59 And I read I think that I think that I don't think that the difference between normie and not normie is that well-defined
00:51:04 But I think that if there is one yeah, I think that's probably
00:51:09 Cuz to look at for example like our own parents which is our probably like our role models in this sense
00:51:14 I look at like our dad and I think my dad my dad right now has like his job is
00:51:19 Causes him a bunch of angst because he has to do a lot of shit for it
00:51:22 And he his happiest moments are on the weekends when he can go sailing and he really love
00:51:26 He really really loves sailing because he can just cut loose and do that shit and not be beholden to anybody
00:51:31 That's what he said is happiest and you know
00:51:33 It just makes you wonder if if he chose and not that he made any mistakes
00:51:36 But that if he chose the optimal way to live his life
00:51:40 Just because you know, I mean, I'm glad I exist because he married my mom that that worked out well for me
00:51:45 But perhaps it worked out better for him if you'd make a different path that let him pursue this kind of pleasurable activities more
00:51:51 You know if having a normal job had any merit at all then why do normies take vacations?
00:52:00 You know, I'm gonna counter-argument that a little bit. I think
00:52:07 Okay, I think that happiness
00:52:16 Not straight
00:52:22 Happiness happiness kind of balances itself out right like like the more miserable your job makes you yeah
00:52:28 Like the happier you are in comparison to it when you can get on the weekend and do what you want to do to a certain point
00:52:34 Yeah, I think that in the long run that kind of like net happiness tends to balance out for people
00:52:40 You know, that's true because humans aren't built to be happy all the time
00:52:43 It doesn't work out when you're given everything like like it would if you think if you think like if if dad's job was to be
00:52:48 I don't know a professional sailor whatever that would even mean right
00:52:51 He would be just static all the time while doing it. Absolutely. No, right. You're you that's so you're entirely right
00:52:57 You're entirely right about that. I don't know
00:53:00 I mean is the optimal life for like everyone to be an artist doing whatever they want like if we were living in
00:53:05 Star Trek and like everyone had everything they need like what would everybody do to obtain like their perfect life?
00:53:12 Would they all just like pursue their artistic endeavors or would they just like play video games?
00:53:16 I would do exactly what I'm doing me too
00:53:19 And I think that's the mark of of like that you're on the right path that that's the case for you
00:53:23 And I think most of us here, which I think is what unites us is that we agree that we are doing that in one way or another
00:53:30 Which means that all six of us are the normies and everyone else to get on our level
00:53:35 Everyone else is a failure and a weirdo you need to be like us
00:53:39 The real question is there's seven of us, so we're the main six plus spike. Which of us is the spike not it not it not it
00:53:46 It's digi digi's not here. It's digi
00:53:49 Digi's off eating ass like spike would be like spike it loves to do
00:53:53 admittedly, okay, so
00:54:01 Do we feel like we've covered this topic in general because before we leave I have one final challenge for us
00:54:07 Let's well should we wait I want us to wait for digi to get back
00:54:09 I don't think he's coming back anytime soon. Okay, let's hear it if he comes back in the middle of it fine
00:54:14 But before we finish this podcast
00:54:16 I really think we should all rank ourselves in terms of who's the most to least agreed agreed
00:54:22 I think and I'm gonna vote that
00:54:24 I'm gonna vote guy for no
00:54:26 Because you have a fucking job
00:54:32 Okay, all right, I don't mean to be critical, but I think Tommy might be a little more normie than me
00:54:38 I don't think so. I don't think so. That's not that's not an insult. I'm just like for example. He has a girlfriend
00:54:43 That's pretty normie. He went to visitor for a while, you know having a girlfriend is pretty fucking
00:54:48 That's right. That's right
00:54:49 I mean I sit here raging all the time that I don't have a girlfriend right now
00:54:54 So say that again. My girlfriend is like a continent away right now
00:54:58 But you have but you have one
00:55:00 I mean, it's pretty normie to to establish a kind of relationship that you would be willing to maintain over a long distance, you know
00:55:07 Well, I've got like some I think there's some merit to what you say guy
00:55:11 Thank you, but I'm still gonna give you
00:55:13 I mean if that's how the consensus will vote then I'll accept it
00:55:16 I do have a nine-to-five job that I work every single week
00:55:19 Making each other's norminess
00:55:24 We're gonna rank ourselves. We're gonna rank the whole portion
00:55:27 I'll just give you mine right now. I guess if that's what it's gonna be. It's gonna be me then I'd say Tom then
00:55:34 Hippocrates cuz he's going to school then maybe then maybe
00:55:38 DeVoo then digi then
00:55:42 Jesse oh no, I forgot Ben Ben's in there somewhere
00:55:46 Jesse's the least normie though is the I
00:55:49 Well, we're talking like lifestyle here
00:55:53 I think I think he is probably
00:55:55 Second least normie second least you think hmm. Yeah, I think so
00:56:01 Possibly I put you up there though pretty high
00:56:03 Well, I take being at last as as the greatest compliment of all but did you just you're the only one who aspires to be normie more than any of us
00:56:11 You know, I'm a complicated guy. I'm a complicated. I'm a man of many contradictions
00:56:15 Just like to say that for the past
00:56:18 I don't know how long we've been doing this like 40 minutes. Yeah, but I've been in a quarter
00:56:23 I've been twisting the ends of my hair into hook shapes
00:56:27 And trying and using those hooks to try and pick my glasses off
00:56:32 Well
00:56:43 Okay, that might be like the nail in the coffin of me ever being considered normie anyways
00:56:49 But this is this is about you beating up children again. It's gonna be the one where you peed on that girl
00:56:55 Okay, well those are two good ones. Yeah
00:56:59 Go on this is an example of how like normie us can come down to perspective
00:57:04 Because you can look at this story one way and it seems like I'm a cool guy who's got it all together
00:57:09 But then you look at it from the truth
00:57:12 I
00:57:15 Was that a Cody LaRue Halloween party three years ago. That's a five-star event. Yeah, so so basically
00:57:23 The normie account of what happened
00:57:25 Is that I went to a party and I hooked up with a girl who I had never even met before
00:57:33 Normie
00:57:36 But what really happened is that I ended up rape he raped her
00:57:42 Very not normie well done. No, I want to hear the truth. I think pedophiles and war mainstreamed and youtubers
00:57:50 Well, what really happened is that I set is that I was getting a blowjob from a very obese woman
00:57:57 in an alleyway in Flint, Michigan nice and
00:58:03 You say it like that
00:58:05 Did that really happen? Yes, he bet your ass it happened
00:58:09 Well, like so like so many of my stories that I think like could almost pass for normie and then I remember like where I live
00:58:17 Yeah, that's true
00:58:19 Yeah, that's not a fact. We haven't considered his geography here. Yeah, I I always think that like from my perspective
00:58:26 By the way, who always seems less normal just because he's from the Midwest and like all of his Midwestern isms are inherently very strange to me
00:58:35 Yeah, I'm a middlest of the Midwest. I'm in the Kansas I'm so proud of the fact
00:58:40 I'm so proud of the fact that a city where I hang out all the time is now in the news and widely
00:58:47 Regarded as not the shithole of America. Yeah. Yeah
00:58:50 It feels me with the bizarre sense of pride and tranquility. It's that's a very non normie thing to be the worst place in America
00:58:57 You know, that's well done
00:59:00 I
00:59:01 Got to give you props for that
00:59:02 Just the fact that I hooked up with a fat chick in my car and you know, you know
00:59:07 I'm like the worst city in America
00:59:09 I I hooked up with a sort of fat Asian girl one time, but not you know, she wasn't full fat, which is great shame
00:59:19 No, no
00:59:21 The Lord of fives so perhaps wait the Lord of fives
00:59:25 Toby Toby and John both both have described you as the no the king of five. I can't wait. Yeah
00:59:30 Um, um guy, have you seen Toby's girlfriend? But he likes fat girls. He's into fat girls. So to him to him
00:59:37 That's yeah, so to him. So to him the skinny girls that I was hooking up with were only five
00:59:42 Oh, you're right. That was Toby who told me that maybe all along. He was leading me. Okay, I need to reevaluate the whole more like king of king
00:59:50 More like ends more like king of the nines as in that thing that black people do where they insult each other creatively back and forth
00:59:57 They call that a nine. Yeah, the nine you play in that's what Hitler played when he burned all the Jews
01:00:02 He was like nine. It was like nine. Hilarious. Get it guys. Very good joke night. Very good. Thank you. Let's wrap this up. Goodbye
01:00:09 Wait, wait, wait. No guys. Where do I fall? Where do I fall on the normie scale?
01:00:13 Then I think you're right about the fucking abnormal. I think you're very non normally
01:00:18 I think it depends on like again, which which normie or not normie things we're talking about, right?
01:00:24 Like is it more normie to live at home with your parents and just basically
01:00:30 Do whatever these days. That's very normie, right? Yeah
01:00:34 like Ben
01:00:35 If we're talking about like right now me and Ben might be like, you know, I don't know closer to toe and toe
01:00:41 Maybe I'm less normie than him
01:00:43 But if we're talking about the Ben that lived bummed around California for a year
01:00:47 Oh, I think that was a little bit
01:00:52 Yeah, that Ben like I could never do that
01:00:55 I think Ben is one in non-norminess. I mean Jesse what we say I forgot to mention the best part of my story
01:01:01 Not only was I getting a blowjob from a fat disgusting pig girl that I've never met in a car in an alleyway in Flint, Michigan
01:01:07 But I was also dressed up as Winnie the Pooh
01:01:17 I
01:01:29 Did she pretend she was Christopher Robin? No, that would happen. I don't think she got the reference
01:01:36 Now that's normie behavior that we can all
01:01:40 He heard this but I'm positive
01:01:43 Knowing how drunk I was I'm positive that I did the voice at some point
01:01:59 No, I'm imagining him in a fursuit and like a Winnie the Pooh fucking
01:02:03 It's not a fursuit
01:02:20 Holy shit in reality Jesse's a Pooh bear costume was just the I'm a bear t-shirt
01:02:26 Or at the altered beast it was legit. I had I got a red shirt. I wrote Pooh on it
01:02:31 I fucking I had the ears. I had that's that basically all you need and my pants were off, too
01:02:37 So the costume was even more accurate
01:02:40 Really I had to go with that girl take my pants off in order for the costume to work
01:02:44 It was he who was loyal to the characters the last that's I like to think that's exactly what Winnie the Pooh would have done
01:02:51 he's
01:02:52 He's the least normie of us all we keep trying to rank ourselves based on our
01:02:57 On our lifestyles, but what about just our personalities like how we would
01:03:05 Difference like I don't know how I think we're all relatively similar. That's why we've all kind of
01:03:11 Yeah
01:03:13 That's how we all met yeah similar interests and similar like goals
01:03:17 I guess I mean what divu would you change the ranking in any significant way based on our personalities?
01:03:23 I don't know Jesse not still be the most
01:03:26 Abnormie
01:03:29 That's the word like I don't know like he's um
01:03:32 Like he has the weirdest things that he doesn't tell anyone about except on the internet
01:03:36 But in terms of just like a person out and you just see them and say hi
01:03:41 You know how weird would each of us right?
01:03:44 I mean our parents yell that through car windows with at an alarming rate when I go out
01:03:50 Which is why part of the reason I don't go out that's because of those those flint brains are added with all that lead
01:03:55 You know, who knows what's going on? I don't know man
01:03:59 I think I think the fact that I crave
01:04:01 Right now. I'm craving to hear how abnormie I am and I really think that speaks to the fact that being a non
01:04:08 Normie is like a pretty normie thing now. It is. It is. It's
01:04:13 Cool, it's edgy. I keep forgetting that my room flooded with poop poopy water and I fucking
01:04:18 I
01:04:19 Made a video
01:04:21 Instead of making steps to clean it
01:04:24 The first thing I did you know
01:04:26 I showed that video to a lot of people now and all of them would say the same thing
01:04:31 I can't believe he'd do his toys in there and I was like
01:04:35 Yeah, I tried to picture myself in the same scenario and I think I definitely would have thrown my toys in there
01:04:40 Like I don't think I would have had much hesitation in doing that
01:04:42 Unless it was like how I know I'm more normie because I would just be freaking out if my water was leaking
01:04:47 I mean, I would have freaked out considerably first and I'm sure Jesse has in the past
01:04:51 But he's just he wakes up one day sees it. There's poop water his house is like, all right
01:04:55 I honestly don't freak out because stuff like that happens to me so often
01:05:00 Yeah, I've acquired a zenness about it. I can definitely talk about his room flooding for years
01:05:04 So I can definitely see digi without the aid of even making a video just deciding cuz he's drunk
01:05:13 I have too much self-restraint
01:05:19 Oh, we were talking about this on a digi bros the other day
01:05:21 How like I used to get like I would get really mad and I'd like want to thrash my room
01:05:25 But then I would look at all the stuff in my room and think about how expensive it all is
01:05:29 And I would just push over a fan like I've done I have literally dropped kicked a fan several times
01:05:35 Just because it was the only thing that wouldn't break if I attacked it
01:05:38 Oh, the closest I've ever come to like real damage was after watching Bojack Horseman
01:05:45 Because I spent the entire time I was watching it getting drunk
01:05:48 Like I didn't stop drinking wine the whole time
01:05:50 I was watching the show and I was like oh like unbelievably beyond wasted by the end of it
01:05:54 and then I put on death grips and I went into my fucking bathroom the first song on on the new out on their latest album was
01:06:01 I break mirrors at my face in the United States and I'm like screaming it into the mirror at myself
01:06:06 And I'm just thinking like I got to do it
01:06:08 I got to break this mirror with my face in the United States
01:06:10 I have to and like I'm like leaning over the over the sink like and I'm thinking about it and I'm like
01:06:15 Do I because I my justification in my mind was I make enough money now that I can replace this mirror
01:06:21 So I was like I could do it. I could break this mirror with my face
01:06:24 I can replace you like Charles Foster Kane just trashing his own room because he has all the money
01:06:30 But then the conclusion or Tommy was Tommy was about to kill himself
01:06:34 But I was just staring at the mirror and then I thought about it and I was like all right first of all
01:06:38 I don't know how badly I'm gonna cut myself up doing this
01:06:41 Maybe I'll end up in the hospital and I don't want to pay those bills and then I thought about it
01:06:44 And I was like I don't know how much these mirrors actually cost. What if this is a $200 mirror
01:06:48 I don't want to spend that because I just wanted to break something with my face
01:06:52 So in spite of how being outrageously drunk and really wanting to break that mirror
01:06:56 I ended up not doing it and
01:06:58 Going back to throw over my desk chair because it you know wouldn't break
01:07:02 The best thing that I ever did was I punched my laptop in the screen and shattered it
01:07:08 because
01:07:09 It was pretty sweet
01:07:11 But it was pretty normie honestly because it was because I was like having a fight with my college girlfriend
01:07:16 You know because I was home for vacation and like we got mad at each other and I was so upset that I broke my laptop
01:07:22 Yeah, but
01:07:24 Walls where my dad had like gotten mad in a fight and just like punched holes through the wall like
01:07:30 Ben's done that Ben's the hole in the wall. I did I did kick a hole through our basement wall
01:07:35 Oh, it's my friend John who punched a hole in the wall. Yeah, okay different. Yeah, I kicked I kicked our wall in
01:07:41 Just a little bit
01:07:45 Because my friend who is a violent maniac who if we if he was here I do have one friend who might be less normie than me
01:07:51 In the sense that he is absolutely violently insane
01:07:55 And we'll like fight people for no reason and that kind of thing
01:08:00 That's like the clinical kind of non-norminess. Yeah
01:08:04 Yeah, there's so there's so many
01:08:05 Absorb his abnorminess. It's like jet me in the one. That's how it works. That's right
01:08:10 There's so many different axes upon which can be one can be normie or non-normie
01:08:18 Anime of all-time dimension w in which there are several axes in which
01:08:25 It's a big fan of yours too. What's that did you the friend of mine who's like super crazy
01:08:29 He's a big yeah, yes, he as well
01:08:31 But yeah, he put a hole in my uh in my in my bathroom door just by because he opened it with his elbow one time
01:08:38 Like just like slammed it with his elbow and broke it and I was like you're too strong
01:08:42 Because he's like a huge monster man like a giant fucking
01:08:47 Yeah, he's a Hulk dude
01:08:50 Is he one of these actually strong guys or did he no he worked out
01:08:53 He was like he was like a skinny little twink in high school
01:08:56 And then he like beefed the fuck up and became a monster. That's my now
01:08:59 He's like a psycho like vegan crazy man. Oh vegan too impressive. Okay. What the hell is this podcast about?
01:09:05 It's about fuck you
01:09:08 Hippo I was I was waiting for a chance for like a pause in the conversation to be like well
01:09:13 I think we've really said a lot on the subject of
01:09:18 Like
01:09:21 General I mean I
01:09:23 Think we've gotten the surprising like we've made it less cringy than it first seemed like it was I don't think it's
01:09:31 I just think it's silly because like we have that
01:09:34 Google doc of all the potential topics and like some of them are like actual topics and then in the middle of it
01:09:40 It just says fucking normies
01:09:45 I mean I mean I think we occasionally touched on some somewhat relevant subject matter
01:09:51 But for the most part we came to no conclusions. We don't understand
01:10:10 I
01:10:31 Stay together and find a place worth fighting for
01:10:37 I'm on the road
01:10:40 to normie city
