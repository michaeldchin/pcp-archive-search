00:00:00 Hello everyone, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:05 I'm the best guy ever, and oh, who do we have here shuffling through my magic card hand?
00:00:10 Not me.
00:00:11 Uh, I play Ben Saint, regrettably.
00:00:13 No, no. Unfortunately, I am unavailable for this recording.
00:00:19 That's a blessing. Not in disguise.
00:00:22 God's Gibbontake here.
00:00:24 Yodelay, hee-hoo!
00:00:27 And Endless Jess.
00:00:31 Such a diverse cast.
00:00:34 What? Say that again?
00:00:36 This is such a diverse cast. We all have a very strange-ness about us.
00:00:41 But it's all different strangeness.
00:00:43 It's a real ensemble piece.
00:00:47 Oh boy, let me tell ya.
00:00:48 Size.
00:00:49 These lives we're living, I've had just about enough.
00:00:53 That's gonna do it for me here, chief.
00:00:57 Hey guys, yes?
00:01:00 Hey there.
00:01:02 Face here for Nickelodeon Junior.
00:01:07 Do you say Nickelodeon Junior?
00:01:08 I'm having connection issues, but like emotional connection issues.
00:01:15 Let me just immediately say something to get us started right off the bat.
00:01:19 Alright, there's been, you know people talk about pizza, right?
00:01:23 You know, pizza, deep dish pizza, thin crust pizza,
00:01:27 Ben, pizza face, you know, the whole-
00:01:30 Keto pizza, Chicago deep dish, all the different classic styles.
00:01:34 And people generally like pizza, correct?
00:01:37 Yeah, I mean it's ingredients on a plate that's made that you can eat the plate.
00:01:42 I would say that pizza hits certain key demographics, yes.
00:01:46 Okay, fair, fair.
00:01:48 But like there's urban centers where they say the best pizza is.
00:01:52 Okay, some people are asshole elitists, and they're like,
00:01:54 oh I like grease, like olive oil on dough,
00:01:57 and then you put like paprika and fucking spinach,
00:02:00 and that's real pizza, fuck off.
00:02:02 I'm not talking to these idiots.
00:02:04 But you know, it's like the Chicago.
00:02:06 My favorite pizza is Papa Geno's from back home, Massachusetts area, New England.
00:02:10 That's the best.
00:02:11 You know, I have a fondness for Papa Geno's.
00:02:14 I don't know if it's the best.
00:02:16 Well, I don't know, there's probably some fancy Gordon Ramsay shit.
00:02:19 Yeah, it's my favorite like commercially available pizza.
00:02:22 Okay, point of all this is, good pizza is a known thing.
00:02:26 People like pizza, people eat good pizza.
00:02:29 I have eaten pizza in Chicago, it's good.
00:02:31 I've eaten it in New England, it's good.
00:02:33 I've eaten it in New York.
00:02:34 I have actually never had Chicago style pizza.
00:02:37 It remains a mystery to me.
00:02:38 I think I have, and it's completely fucking generic.
00:02:41 There's nothing special about it.
00:02:43 I hate all this pizza elitism from Chicago and New York.
00:02:46 They think they're so fucking,
00:02:48 hey, oh, New York pizza, the best pizza,
00:02:51 and no Chicago pizza, the best pizza.
00:02:54 Ah, you're both fucking stupid.
00:02:56 It's just regular pizza.
00:02:57 It's all about regular pizza.
00:02:59 That's true, and there are different varieties, like whatever, thicker, thinner.
00:03:02 Okay, fine.
00:03:03 All right, but, but, here's the point of all this.
00:03:06 Yesterday, I had, for the millionth time in my life, in Cincinnati,
00:03:11 there's what's known as La Rosa Pizza.
00:03:14 This is like the Papagenos of the Ohio, probably Tri-County, Tri-State area.
00:03:20 Every time when I was at work, every time we got pizza, it was La Rosa's pizza.
00:03:26 This is the staple.
00:03:28 It is the number one pizza people get here.
00:03:30 Okay, but yesterday, I was out with Michelle,
00:03:32 and I'm like, Michelle, for your education, you haven't had La Rosa's pizza.
00:03:36 I want you to taste it.
00:03:37 So let's go buy a whole pizza, taste it, and tell me what you think.
00:03:41 So let's go buy it, and just, just as it always is,
00:03:44 as it was every single fucking time they got it at work,
00:03:47 when there are so many other varieties available,
00:03:49 it is the most bland, tasteless, terrible, cardboard, little bit of sauce.
00:03:55 Like, it's greasy, not too greasy.
00:03:57 It's just terrible.
00:03:58 La Rosa's pizza in Ohio is so bad.
00:04:02 It is so unbelievably flavorless and awful.
00:04:06 And yet, like, the professional environment in which I worked,
00:04:09 these people have some amount of taste.
00:04:11 I know people like to roast Ohio for having terrible food,
00:04:14 and it's true, and it's true.
00:04:16 La Rosa's pizza is the most vile.
00:04:19 I would rather get Papa John's any day, any day.
00:04:23 Domino's, any fucking day.
00:04:25 La Rosa's is disgusting.
00:04:27 It's, I just, I was blown away, and the point is Michelle agreed.
00:04:31 I gave it to her.
00:04:32 She's like, wow, this really is literally zero flavor.
00:04:34 This is totally tasteless.
00:04:35 So it's been verified by an outside party.
00:04:37 I cannot believe, in a world of possibilities that we live in,
00:04:42 that for years, I worked at this company for like four or five years or whatever,
00:04:46 every fucking time they went back to the same fucking well and got La Rosa's pizza.
00:04:51 You go to a theme park, La Rosa's is the only pizza chain that's there in this area.
00:04:56 It's so shit when, like, Chicago is not even that far.
00:05:00 And sure, Jesse, Chicago, not like, there's nothing to fucking go crazy about
00:05:06 but it has flavor.
00:05:07 It does taste like pizza and it's good.
00:05:09 La Rosa's tastes horrible.
00:05:12 It's terrible.
00:05:13 But everyone tells me that Chicago's pizza is like weird and like it's like more like a pie
00:05:17 and it's like liquid and it's like a soup, just like a crust full of soup, like sauce and cheese.
00:05:23 Okay, to be fair, I've only had Chicago pizza one time at the airport when I was flying through
00:05:28 and I made sure to do it for the meme.
00:05:30 And that, my experience with that pizza was it was very thick and quite delicious.
00:05:33 So this is my one data point there.
00:05:35 But I've had tons of other pizza.
00:05:37 Look, this is the real point.
00:05:39 There is literally zero flavor in this pizza.
00:05:41 They think they can get by with like cheese, which is the solution to every problem in Ohio,
00:05:47 but it doesn't fucking work.
00:05:49 There's no flip.
00:05:50 And I was holding the pizza in my hand, moving it towards my mouth to take a bite
00:05:55 and the crust just crumbles away in my hand and it falls to the ground like the cardboard it is.
00:06:00 I was lucky.
00:06:01 The entire slice didn't turn to dust as I moved it towards my mouth
00:06:05 evaporating, preventing me from eating any of it.
00:06:08 This is just a public service announcement.
00:06:10 Don't eat LaRosa's.
00:06:11 It's bad pizza.
00:06:13 It tastes like ass.
00:06:14 You can do better.
00:06:15 Ohio, you can do better Cincinnati.
00:06:17 There is everyone don't eat there.
00:06:18 It's shit.
00:06:19 There is a pizza place right down the street from where I live and we've been there a couple times
00:06:23 and it's not, it's just, it's just really unfortunate.
00:06:28 It's really unfortunate.
00:06:29 Like it's, it's, the slices are like soggy.
00:06:33 They come out there like soggy.
00:06:34 You pick up the slice and it just droops.
00:06:36 It is just like wet paper.
00:06:38 Just like, and it is, it's on the toppings are good, but like the crust is just like they just failed.
00:06:43 They just failed.
00:06:44 I don't even remember what this place is called.
00:06:46 There needs to be collected like a national index of all the bad pizza.
00:06:50 So people know because bad pizza is a tragedy that could happen to anyone at any time.
00:06:55 You never know until it's too late.
00:06:57 I mean, if you've had it before, you can go, that place sucks.
00:06:59 But you have to fucking, you have to dive in to the deep end first.
00:07:02 I can figure that out.
00:07:04 That's very, this is an eye-opening experience to warn people.
00:07:07 This was such an eye-opening experience to make me aware of how much better other pizza I've had in my life was.
00:07:13 I get like excited when I get a pizza from Papa Jean or something.
00:07:16 I get dread when I realize that there's LaRose's pizza.
00:07:19 But yes, I'll eat it anyway because it's fucking free.
00:07:22 Of course I'm going to take this moment to shout out a little known chain.
00:07:25 They don't have it around here.
00:07:27 I think they maybe only have it in the south and maybe in California, I don't know.
00:07:33 They don't have it in New England, it's a shame.
00:07:35 But Jets Pizza.
00:07:37 I never hear anyone talk about Jets Pizza.
00:07:39 Jets is wicked good.
00:07:41 It's like big rectangles.
00:07:43 It's like thick crust.
00:07:45 The crust is crunchy on the outside.
00:07:47 I don't know.
00:07:49 I wish Jets were everywhere.
00:07:52 If they were here, I would get it.
00:07:54 Only I wouldn't because it's not keto.
00:07:56 That's fair.
00:07:58 I know that we've talked about preferences of pizza before.
00:08:00 There's an ongoing thick crust, thin crust debate.
00:08:02 But I get fantasies dreaming about like,
00:08:04 you know when you've got a thin crust pizza cooked just right?
00:08:07 So the edges of the crust have a little bit of cheese and they've turned black.
00:08:11 And you know when you bite into them, you're going to get that crunch
00:08:14 and that snap of those carcinogens passing in your body and giving you cancer.
00:08:18 But it's worth it.
00:08:20 Cheese is like boiling and you've got those delicious weird bubbles of dough
00:08:24 with the cheese on top and maybe there's some sauce on top.
00:08:27 Papa Jean has all about those crust bubbles.
00:08:30 I couldn't be a bigger fan.
00:08:32 I had a really good pizza experience when Munchie was visiting in London.
00:08:38 I can't remember the name of the place.
00:08:40 But there are quite a lot of Italians in London.
00:08:43 I mean it's closer to Italy so they can import all the good ingredients and stuff.
00:08:48 I keep saying it in every restaurant.
00:08:50 It's like we got all the ingredients from this Italian town.
00:08:54 This tiny little Italian town.
00:08:57 We got the flour from here and we got whatever from there.
00:09:00 And it is such good pizza.
00:09:03 It's so Italian.
00:09:05 I don't know how to describe.
00:09:07 It's that sort of like really bubbly dough that's crust that's sort of blackened a bit
00:09:12 because they flame it.
00:09:15 I don't know like the proper pizza oven thing.
00:09:18 But we were in like this really shitty cheek looking like plastic green and white checkerboard
00:09:26 Super Mario on the walls.
00:09:28 Pizza basement.
00:09:30 Pizza basement was the name of the chain.
00:09:34 I don't think it was a chain.
00:09:36 I think it was just like that's it.
00:09:38 Pizza basement on the top of the Eiffel Tower on the top of the Empire State Building.
00:09:43 We're in a like a tiny courtyard that was super cramped.
00:09:46 There was like 18,000 restaurants and there's like five meters square.
00:09:50 And then we went down into this pizza basement and it was the best pizza I've ever had in my life.
00:09:55 Please draw a fan out of pizza basement of the whole PCP crew.
00:09:59 We're having a good dinner at the pizza basement.
00:10:01 Let me tell you a pizza story.
00:10:03 So in college, I majored in, I had double majored in physics and philosophy.
00:10:09 I majored in pizza and pepperoni.
00:10:11 It was a great time.
00:10:12 And with a minor in pepperoni studies.
00:10:15 But the philosophy, every department had its own like had a budget for the year, right?
00:10:19 And the philosophy department just didn't do anything.
00:10:22 They didn't have anything to spend their funding on.
00:10:24 It was philosophy after all.
00:10:25 Because what do they do?
00:10:26 So at the end of every year, the philosophy department would just go take the whole department out to like a local pizza place
00:10:32 and just have a pizza party and just say, everyone eat as much pizza as you possibly can.
00:10:37 We need to spend our budget so that we don't get our budget reduced last year.
00:10:41 We need to spend it all on pizza right now.
00:10:44 Or we're fucked.
00:10:45 Buy a book, dog.
00:10:47 Buy a book.
00:10:48 I don't know.
00:10:49 Maybe they could like spend some of that money like to prank call, deliver pizzas to people they don't like.
00:10:55 I mean, I assume they just burned it.
00:10:57 Whatever we didn't, whatever we didn't spend on pizza, I assume they just flushed down the toilet the next day.
00:11:02 I know everyone's made this observation before, but what a silly like cost structure that like we need to waste this money.
00:11:08 I'm sure the party was fun, but.
00:11:10 It's almost like capitalism doesn't work.
00:11:13 Damn you capitalism.
00:11:14 Damn.
00:11:15 By the way, I watched.
00:11:16 One of the reasons I've been thinking about this was because the other day I watched like some like Buzzfeed video.
00:11:21 I don't know whatever it was.
00:11:22 I watched, well, first of all, I watched a Gordon Ramsay makes like a pro chef pizza, which was amazing.
00:11:26 Then I watched this like, it was like a Buzzfeed video or something of like three tiers of chefs.
00:11:30 There was like some amateur fuck boy, some like mom, like with the Italian heritage or whatever.
00:11:35 And then like a pro chef and like how each of them made their pizza.
00:11:39 And like, there was obviously scrub was, you know, I think I've seen videos like that.
00:11:44 It's like, yeah, three, three different like levels making the same dish and describing their different.
00:11:49 Yeah.
00:11:50 Yeah, yeah.
00:11:51 It was cool and educational.
00:11:52 And like the pizza that the pro chef made was like so advanced, like he made, he was like different brands of cheese.
00:11:58 He has like a whole like fucking biology like evil scientist lab where he like concocts like from like some sort of culture starter,
00:12:06 like bacteria or something that produces the dough or like the yeast or something that makes it exact.
00:12:11 And actually the mom did it too.
00:12:13 The middle level one as well.
00:12:15 I don't know.
00:12:16 It was pretty cool.
00:12:17 But like, man, there's a whole world of pizza out there.
00:12:19 I want to get there and get in that fancy.
00:12:21 There's a series of videos on the channel called Epicurious that I kind of like and it's where they have a,
00:12:26 they have a like an expert in a certain food and then they will bring like they'll have a series of like sort of comparisons where like they'll bring in like two,
00:12:35 two samples of this different food or like something related to it, right?
00:12:40 Like, like ice cream, right?
00:12:42 They had an ice cream expert and they have like two vanilla ice creams and they have the expert like they'll take it and like they'll look at it and they'll describe what they see and they'll smell it and stuff.
00:12:50 And they'll describe that and they'll taste it and they'll describe like all the differences they notice between them.
00:12:55 And then they'll estimate like which they think is like the more expensive and they'll do a reveal.
00:12:59 And it's just really interesting to hear like, you know, they'll talk about like the processes involved in its production and like what is like,
00:13:05 what is considered like higher quality versus lower quality in each of these things and like what gives a better flavor or texture or whatever.
00:13:12 And I like those.
00:13:13 They're pretty neat.
00:13:14 Yeah, that's cool.
00:13:15 They have like a pickle guy, a coffee guy, a tea guy.
00:13:19 They've got a bunch.
00:13:21 I appreciate those.
00:13:22 By the way, total left turn.
00:13:23 But for some reason, speaking about these things is to be thinking about existentialism and nihilism and YouTube.
00:13:29 Has anyone ever watched that one guy that Digi talks about who's the, he's like the existentialist YouTuber who talks about like how life is meaningless and pointless.
00:13:38 And I think he has like a turtle avatar.
00:13:40 You know what I'm talking about?
00:13:41 Is that turtle worthy?
00:13:43 You mean Looney Turtle?
00:13:45 Yes, that's the one.
00:13:48 That's a blast from the past.
00:13:50 Yeah.
00:13:51 All right, you know what, never mind.
00:13:52 I have no idea what you're talking about.
00:13:53 Is he the guy who Digi's been tweeting a lot?
00:13:56 You know, I have Digi muted, so I couldn't tell you.
00:14:02 Probably.
00:14:03 I know Digi's a fan and I would watch it.
00:14:07 Whatever.
00:14:08 Anyway, that's the end of my pizza tirade.
00:14:10 We can jump ship immediately.
00:14:12 For my birthday a few months ago, I asked for like to go to a Harry Potter making of studio tour thing.
00:14:22 And I didn't, they didn't have tickets until today and I just went.
00:14:27 You went today?
00:14:29 Yeah, it's been a few months because that was just when the tickets were available.
00:14:35 But Warner Brothers Studio Tour London with Harry Potter and stuff, really cool, expensive.
00:14:42 But you know, it's just one of those fun things to do.
00:14:46 I saw Dobby, I saw Hagrid, I saw The Fibbon Forest and Aragog came from the treetops and he was a big spider on strings.
00:14:56 And I went, ah!
00:14:57 Was this like a theme park dark ride?
00:14:59 It was like, it's like a tour, it's like a, I mean, it's their actual studio where they film things.
00:15:05 So like you can walk through the great hall where they have all the things.
00:15:10 Yeah, the real sets are dolled up for tourists and all that.
00:15:14 And yeah, there was a lot of cool stuff.
00:15:19 They had this funny green screen thing where you sit on a broom and they film you as you're like flying around.
00:15:25 And you say, oh, they blow wind in your hair.
00:15:28 And you're like, oh, shit, I'm being chased or whatever.
00:15:31 I'm on a broomstick.
00:15:33 You should have asked them to please do that and give you the raw green screen footage so that people can like meme you onto things.
00:15:39 Oh, yeah.
00:15:40 They, yeah, I don't think they would have even, I'm not sure they would have even known how.
00:15:45 Because the people there just push your button and then it's done and I have to go pick it up somewhere.
00:15:50 But I have the footage.
00:15:52 Oh, can we see it?
00:15:55 Yeah, maybe, maybe we can see it.
00:15:57 Maybe you can, I mean, it's sort of like a silly stupid thing.
00:16:00 That's why it's funny.
00:16:02 No kidding.
00:16:03 But yeah, it was just, it was fun.
00:16:06 I had butter beer, which is like, it tastes like root beer, but it has like clotted cream on the top, which is really nice.
00:16:14 Ew, that sounds good.
00:16:16 It's somehow good.
00:16:19 Remember that candy store?
00:16:22 I should tell the story about me buying the one pineapple gummy.
00:16:28 Okay, go.
00:16:29 Oh, yeah.
00:16:30 What are the points?
00:16:31 Isn't that the whole story?
00:16:32 In the line, that's the whole story.
00:16:34 In the line for the counter, they had butter beer.
00:16:38 And I was like, ooh, butter beer.
00:16:40 They, no, okay, we went into this candy store.
00:16:44 We're all in this candy store and I just, I'm looking to, because I love candy stores and I love gummies.
00:16:48 Gummies are like my favorite food in the world, but obviously it's not keto, so I wasn't going to get it.
00:16:52 But I saw these like big, like 3D, like, like, like, they weren't just like flat shapes of a pineapple.
00:16:58 They were like 3D pineapple shapes and they smelled incredible.
00:17:00 And I was like, okay, I can eat one of these, right?
00:17:03 And I'm like, I'm looking around and I'm like, could I just, you know, like, you go to a grocery store,
00:17:11 you can just like eat a grape or something off the, off a grape bunch.
00:17:14 And no one, right, that episode of The Simpsons where Margie eats the grape.
00:17:17 Yeah, and that's fine.
00:17:18 That's ethical.
00:17:19 I was like, could I just do that?
00:17:20 Like, do I have to go through the rigmarole of buying this one pineapple gummy?
00:17:24 And I was like, nah, I'll do it.
00:17:27 I guess I'll do it.
00:17:28 So I use the tongs and I get my one little pineapple gummy, you know,
00:17:31 because you get the bag and you're supposed to put your candy in the bag and they weigh it at the end.
00:17:34 Right.
00:17:35 You buy it based on weight.
00:17:36 So I put the one pineapple gummy in the, in the bag and I go up and I go up to the counter
00:17:42 and I'm like, one, please, please, ma'am, please, charge me.
00:17:47 Please, sir, my keto diet can tolerate just one little gummy.
00:17:51 It can tolerate only one.
00:17:53 And, and I don't know, the lady behind the counter was just like, um, yeah, you don't have to, you know,
00:17:57 you can just have that.
00:17:58 You can just have that.
00:17:59 You can just, she said like, she said like, um, you know, you could just ask someone who's
00:18:05 working the floor if you want a sample and like they'll give you one.
00:18:07 Like they'll just let you have one.
00:18:08 I was like, okay, cool.
00:18:10 And then, and then someone, one of the guys who was hanging out with us,
00:18:13 like I told them that that happened and they were like, oh, so we can just have,
00:18:17 so we can just have samples.
00:18:18 And I was like, oh no.
00:18:19 And I was like, well, well, well, I think you're supposed to ask for,
00:18:21 but he had already like grabbed like a big chunk of chocolate, like out of a, out of a,
00:18:25 out of one of the things and was like already eating it.
00:18:27 And I was like, ah, fuck.
00:18:30 But anyway, that pineapple, pretty good, pretty good.
00:18:33 Well, that's great.
00:18:34 I also love gummies with a passion.
00:18:36 I suspect it's genetic.
00:18:37 It's definitely genetic.
00:18:38 With his ape-like foot and grabbed a foot full of delicious candy gummies.
00:18:45 He grabbed an entire fruit by the foot.
00:18:48 Wait.
00:18:49 An ape-like foot.
00:18:50 An ape-like foot is a hand.
00:18:52 Yeah.
00:18:53 Well, I mean, he's got, he's like the beast from X-Men First Class.
00:18:56 He found like a, a roller of fruit by the foot that actually can go beyond a foot
00:19:00 and you just keep pulling it.
00:19:01 He already like, like, you know, like a Looney Tunes style.
00:19:03 He'd put his mouth on a wimp.
00:19:05 He's just pulling, he's pulling it out like handkerchiefs.
00:19:08 Like a clown pulling handkerchiefs out of every nose or whatever.
00:19:11 Indeed.
00:19:12 Indeed.
00:19:13 Wait, it was like, it was like that one shot in, I can't remember what medium this is
00:19:16 from, but I, oh, I think it was Rabbit from Winnie the Pooh, who's just staying there
00:19:20 and's like, yep, no need for a scarecrow this season.
00:19:22 The crows descend.
00:19:23 Everything is consumed and they all rise up and it's all abandoned.
00:19:26 Yes.
00:19:27 The entire, the entire landscape is just blanketed in crows and then like moments later they
00:19:30 fly away and the whole thing is just reduced to a barren hellscape.
00:19:33 You're the expert on Pooh.
00:19:34 Do you remember why that happened to, to, to Rabbit?
00:19:37 Cause it's funny.
00:19:38 Yeah, but like, did he get rid of a scarecrow or what was the logic of the, of the scene?
00:19:42 Oh God, it's the, oh fuck.
00:19:45 What, was it the one with the balloon?
00:19:47 I remember, I watched this when I was doing the Pooh reviews.
00:19:49 I don't think it was the episode where he's got the balloon with the balloon that he turns
00:19:54 into a scarecrow.
00:19:55 It's, it's shit.
00:19:57 No, I don't remember what I, I, fuck.
00:19:59 Sorry.
00:20:00 Maybe, maybe our wonderful viewers can tell us in the comments below.
00:20:03 I got it.
00:20:04 I want to find out.
00:20:05 It's some, someone takes, I think it's probably Tigger.
00:20:08 Tigger probably just fucks something up, like knocks his scarecrow over, takes his scarecrow
00:20:12 away or something and then just immediately just obliterated.
00:20:16 Yeah.
00:20:17 Yeah.
00:20:18 Oh by the way.
00:20:19 Not even just his garden, but like the entire earth.
00:20:21 Is it just true?
00:20:22 Yeah.
00:20:23 That's a sympathy for Rabbit.
00:20:25 Everyone in that show is insane except for him.
00:20:28 But it's, Rabbit's an asshole.
00:20:30 Yeah.
00:20:31 But I'm, but I'm so sympathetic to like the asshole character surrounded by people who
00:20:35 like as you grow up, you realize they were the normal one all, all around, all along.
00:20:39 Yeah.
00:20:40 It's like, can you blame him for being an asshole surrounded by these mad men all 24 seven?
00:20:44 Yeah.
00:20:45 I used to, when I was in high school, I was a big like Metallica fan.
00:20:48 And like I hated Lars Ulrich because I like bought into the meme, the drummer, because
00:20:52 he like sued Napster and everything.
00:20:54 Like he came off like a, like a spoiled rock star or whatever and like a nerdy guy.
00:20:58 You know, the meme was that he was like the sucky one in the band.
00:21:01 And I had a shirt in high school made that was like, Jesse says the only good Lars Ulrich
00:21:07 is a dead Lars Ulrich.
00:21:09 And there was like a picture of a pirate on it.
00:21:12 Like to symbolize King.
00:21:14 That's so specific.
00:21:15 Yeah.
00:21:16 That's dope.
00:21:17 Yeah.
00:21:18 That is very specific.
00:21:19 Just recently like a conveniently you went to school with a guy named Lars Ulrich.
00:21:23 Unrelated.
00:21:24 No connection.
00:21:26 Lars Ulrich, the third Ulrich brother, state alchemists.
00:21:29 Lars Ulrich of Melnambaday.
00:21:33 So just like last week, I rewatched for the first time in like 15 years, the Metallica
00:21:39 documentary, some kind of monster where they're like, it was, it was filmed in like 2002 when
00:21:45 they were trying to record the St. Anger album and they were like totally falling apart as
00:21:49 a band.
00:21:50 And like James was in like rehab for a year, their basis had left.
00:21:54 So they were trying to find a new basis on top of it.
00:21:56 They were all like not getting along.
00:21:58 They had like 20 years of pent up like brother hatred for each other.
00:22:01 Yeah.
00:22:02 And so like, I watched that for the first time in like, since it came out the other week,
00:22:07 and I'm watching it and I realized Lars is the only normal fucking person in this band
00:22:12 and he's the hero of this movie.
00:22:14 And like, I didn't see that as a kid, but now like being a little older, I can see that
00:22:18 like, he's the only one in that movie who like wants to do their job and wants to put
00:22:22 together an album.
00:22:23 And the rest of them are just fucking off with their therapist and like, I got to, I
00:22:27 can only record the album until 4pm every day.
00:22:30 And then I got to go home to my family guys.
00:22:32 And you know, if you guys are working on the album when I'm not here, I'll feel like
00:22:36 decisions are being made without me.
00:22:38 And like Lars is just sitting there the whole time just like chewing his food loudly.
00:22:42 Like, I thought we were a fucking rock band, you know, this is fucking bullshit.
00:22:47 I just want to rock, you know, you guys are fucking talking all this psycho babble bullshit
00:22:52 and it's driving me fucking crazy, man.
00:22:55 And there's like one part where he just like yells in James' face.
00:22:58 And it's, he's like the smallest like weakest guy.
00:23:01 And yet he's like the only swinging dick in the fucking band left.
00:23:05 And he's, he's my hero.
00:23:07 He's a fucking, and like, there's like one part where they're like talking about Jason,
00:23:12 the, it's like the best documentary ever.
00:23:15 It's fucking hilarious.
00:23:16 It's like, it's like, it's like real life spinal tap, but better than spinal tap,
00:23:20 like more ridiculous and asinine than they could even make up.
00:23:24 Oh my God.
00:23:25 This just in, Lars Ulrich has been murdered.
00:23:28 The murderous final statement was, I did it for Jesse's shirt.
00:23:31 He was right.
00:23:32 The only dead Ulrich was a Lars Ulrich.
00:23:35 Sorry guys.
00:23:37 I grew that shirt until my dying day.
00:23:41 There's like in one part where like they're talking about Jason, the bassist who left
00:23:46 and like, well, you know, they're all talking like, well, I think like it would hurt Jason's feelings
00:23:51 if we did this or if we made this decision.
00:23:53 And like Lars is just listening to this, just like stewing.
00:23:56 And they're like talking about Jason like, well, what's Jason gonna feel like?
00:23:59 And like finally Lars just like snaps and he goes, he fucking left the band.
00:24:05 And it's like, and so like, I want that to be my new catchphrase.
00:24:08 Whenever someone fucking, whenever I get stressed out again, without context,
00:24:12 I'm just going to yell on someone's face.
00:24:14 He fucking left the band!
00:24:17 This fucking so pathetic, this is like sandbox shit.
00:24:22 This is like when I see my fucking, my kid argue with his friend over who gets to fucking play with a lightsaber.
00:24:29 Seriously.
00:24:32 This is the fucking sandbox.
00:24:34 Well, he's wounded.
00:24:35 Huh?
00:24:37 Yeah, but you know, it's up to him to mend himself and we're giving him every opportunity.
00:24:42 He fucking left the band!
00:24:44 He fucking left the band!
00:24:46 Which part of that is, hello?
00:24:51 Do you know what I mean?
00:24:52 He fucking left the band!
00:24:55 I mean, period!
00:24:57 Explamation point!
00:25:00 Which part of that is forgotten?
00:25:03 I just, which part of that got left out of the equation?
00:25:10 You're right.
00:25:11 The fuck did we turn into the bad guys?
00:25:13 I don't understand that part.
00:25:15 He fucking left the fucking band!
00:25:18 Jesus Christ!
00:25:21 It's beautiful.
00:25:22 There's like, and there's this, there's this one clip on, on YouTube.
00:25:25 Everyone can look this up.
00:25:27 Look up like Lars gets his toe crushed.
00:25:32 Okay.
00:25:33 It's like, it's a scene in the movie where they're just like producing the album or whatever.
00:25:38 And Bob Rock in his chair just like goes over, cause like Lars does not wear shoes throughout the entire movie.
00:25:45 He's always just this like slovenly barefoot guy stuffing his face with food.
00:25:49 And so like at one point Bob Rock like spins his, his wheelie chair like over his toe.
00:25:56 And like the comedic timing from every single person in this 17 second clip.
00:26:02 It's like you could not have scripted it more hilarious.
00:26:05 It's just like.
00:26:06 I found it.
00:26:08 Yeah.
00:26:09 There it is.
00:26:10 Take a look.
00:26:11 Put it up there.
00:26:12 We got it.
00:26:13 Let me tell you something that we gotta fix drum-wise.
00:26:16 Ow!
00:26:17 Don't fucking ever do that again!
00:26:19 Ever!
00:26:20 Don't you put some fucking shoes on?
00:26:21 Don't tell me what to do.
00:26:22 You shouldn't put your foot under his wheel.
00:26:25 Okay.
00:26:26 Now can I show you the flaw in the drumming?
00:26:28 Don't fucking ever do that again!
00:26:31 Poor bastard.
00:26:33 And then fucking Kirk's like, no, you don't put your fucking toe under his chair.
00:26:39 You know, it's funny how just we're all, I mean, we're all just children.
00:26:42 We're all just children who are mad that our toe got stepped on.
00:26:45 And we need to cry about it to the people around us.
00:26:48 And there's no getting out of that.
00:26:50 We'll be that forever.
00:26:51 Humanity needs to transcend, become pure energy to get away from shit.
00:26:54 I just love like how...
00:26:55 But I like this shit.
00:26:57 Well, fair enough that.
00:26:58 This fucking clip is like almost, it's so, like every single line like builds to a punchline.
00:27:05 It's like this, the most weird thing to ever be caught on.
00:27:08 Because like the first line is Bob Rock like saying like, oh, I want to show you what's wrong with your drumming here.
00:27:13 And then he's like, oh, don't fucking ever do that again!
00:27:17 Don't fucking put your toe under his chair!
00:27:20 And then like the last fucking word of it is like, okay, can I tell you what's wrong with the drumming now?
00:27:24 It's like, it's like a fucking spinal tap clip or something.
00:27:28 I've watched it millions of times and it never stops being the best thing I've ever seen.
00:27:32 Lars Ulrich, you are my hero and I'm sorry I ever doubted you.
00:27:37 You're the coolest guy ever.
00:27:39 How nice, how nice.
00:27:41 Reminds me a little bit of Paul McCartney.
00:27:43 And now I know nothing about the Beatles, their dynamic,
00:27:45 but as I understand it, Paul McCartney was the most quote-unquote normal one.
00:27:48 And also like the slave driver.
00:27:50 Yeah, he was a slave, not a slave driver, but like he was, he was very focused on like the work.
00:27:57 Based Paul, you can thank him for your fucking albums, everyone.
00:28:02 Now, bow! Get on your knees and beg for forgiveness!
00:28:06 Remember that one, everybody?
00:28:08 I remember that.
00:28:09 Yeah, alright, good.
00:28:10 I remember when Paul said that.
00:28:13 You know, I just, I would really, really, really like to meet Paul McCartney before he dies,
00:28:20 but I don't think I'm going to get the chance.
00:28:22 And this fills me with a little bit of sadness every day.
00:28:24 He's kind of, he's one of my heroes in this world.
00:28:26 I don't give a fuck that he's some corporate shill asshole now.
00:28:29 He is my fucking administrative managerial...
00:28:31 Wait, is he a corporate shill?
00:28:33 What's this?
00:28:34 Well, okay, frankly I don't know anything about him.
00:28:37 Personally, other than he was the like slave driver of the Beatles.
00:28:41 But that's enough.
00:28:42 I want to meet the man who whipped these fucking asshole, crazy people into shape
00:28:46 and made them produce art for the world to enjoy.
00:28:48 Because without the managers of the world, the lowly Arby's employees wouldn't be serving anybody those sandwiches,
00:28:54 and then where would we be?
00:28:55 He is my favorite manager in history.
00:28:57 I know he wasn't literally the manager, but you know what I'm saying.
00:29:00 I take some comfort from his existence, and I would really like to shake his hand one day.
00:29:06 He's getting fucking old, so I don't know what my window is like to...
00:29:09 Well, you've got to go to a Paul McCartney gig, and then you've got to jump onto the stage.
00:29:13 That's exactly true.
00:29:14 I should do some...
00:29:16 Yeah, that's true.
00:29:17 I should do some amount of research into how I can meet the guy.
00:29:20 But then on the other hand, I think to myself, like, how much effort do I really want to put into this?
00:29:24 These are my conflicting emotions.
00:29:26 I mean, yeah, if it's like a casual chance to meet your hero, then it's like, oh, it's just suddenly a decision I can make.
00:29:34 But it's like, I wouldn't really go out of my way to try and figure out how to become, like, I don't know,
00:29:42 to meet and become best friends with someone that I like.
00:29:45 I just want to look at him, you know?
00:29:46 I just want to look at his body.
00:29:47 I want to gaze at him up and down, and I want to say to him, hey, hey, lad, remember when you go...
00:29:54 Why would you talk to him in that accent?
00:29:56 Because that's the only language he understands, Gabe.
00:29:59 I've done my research.
00:30:00 I'm aware of how to speak to the man.
00:30:03 Oh, I mean, the lad is in Liverpool.
00:30:05 We recorded music, and then we played it, and that's about it.
00:30:12 Tell me more, Nate.
00:30:14 I didn't know you were there at the time.
00:30:17 I was there, and I am him.
00:30:19 I feel like I'm the reincarnation of Paul McCartney.
00:30:21 That reminds me of...
00:30:23 I saw a Wang video the other day about the fake...
00:30:28 Oh, God.
00:30:30 Hold on.
00:30:31 Who's the drummer from Dream Theater?
00:30:33 Drummer from Dream.
00:30:36 Mike Portnoy.
00:30:37 For a period of several months, there was a fake Mike Portnoy going around, like, sleeping with other men,
00:30:45 and then robbing them under the pretense, like, stealing their wallets and shit,
00:30:50 under the pretense that he was Mike Portnoy.
00:30:52 And he even, like, weaseled his way into, like, industry events with, like, other actual rock stars
00:30:57 because he looked like Mike Portnoy and he had a really convincing...
00:31:01 Like, he had an incredibly thorough knowledge of, like, the band's entire history and, like, touring schedule.
00:31:06 Fascinating.
00:31:07 Yeah, and he, like, really...
00:31:09 He really duped him.
00:31:10 But then, like, rock stars would be like, I knew something was off because, like, you know, I was hanging out,
00:31:15 I was at this thing, I was at this party, like, all these other rock...
00:31:17 Everyone was telling me, oh, yeah, Mike Portnoy's here.
00:31:19 Like, other famous people were like, yeah, Mike Portnoy, here he is.
00:31:22 This is Mike Portnoy.
00:31:23 I was like, oh, Mike Portnoy, great to meet you.
00:31:24 Yeah, you look just like him.
00:31:25 But then he started drumming, and he just sucked.
00:31:28 It's like...
00:31:30 Like, what's going on here?
00:31:32 You know, sometimes I feel like if I tried, I could maybe meet Jimmy Page or something
00:31:39 because... or Robert Plant.
00:31:41 Possibly.
00:31:42 No, because specifically my dad, his...
00:31:45 On his side of the family, there's a guy...
00:31:50 Yes, Uncle Jeff.
00:31:52 Uncle Jeff was like a roadie tour guide with Led Zeppelin,
00:31:57 and he knows them personally.
00:31:59 Right.
00:32:00 And I was, like, young when my dad explained this to him.
00:32:04 Like, I was getting into, like, Led Zeppelin stuff,
00:32:08 and my dad said, hey, your Uncle Jeff, you know, he toured with Led Zeppelin.
00:32:13 He was, like, the road guy.
00:32:16 And I was too stupid to, like, really understand what that meant,
00:32:21 so I never really got close to him.
00:32:23 But, like, if I tried, I could probably, like...
00:32:26 Like, I don't know.
00:32:28 I could say, at least, that I'd been in a location where a guy who knows a guy was cool.
00:32:37 Yeah.
00:32:38 I mean, that's kind of the other side of this.
00:32:40 It's like, you know, one of my heroes, Nobu Uematsu, music composer
00:32:44 who made, like, all the Final Fantasy music for a million years.
00:32:47 No, it's Uncle Phil.
00:32:48 Excuse me, Uncle Phil.
00:32:49 Uncle Phil?
00:32:50 Okay.
00:32:51 Like, in Fresh Prince?
00:32:52 That guy.
00:32:53 I gotta look up his name.
00:32:55 There was, I mean, I didn't meet Nobu Uematsu.
00:32:58 I did meet Hiro Nobu Sakaguchi.
00:33:00 No, sorry, not Sakaguchi.
00:33:01 Yoshaka Amano, the artist who did all, like, the logos and the early Final Fantasy art.
00:33:06 I shook his hand with his right hand, his drawing hand, and I felt his power flow into me.
00:33:10 That was in a New York anime convention years and years ago when I was in college.
00:33:14 I looked at Nobu Uematsu because I went to a distant world's Final Fantasy music concert,
00:33:22 again, in college, and was fucking sick.
00:33:24 But you could have paid extra money to go backstage and, like, do, like, a meet and greet with, like, Nobu
00:33:31 and, like, the band or, like, the conductor or whatever.
00:33:35 So, like, that's, you know, like, yeah, you can do it if you just, like, are willing to throw money at it,
00:33:39 which, you know, I have someone, I guess I could do that.
00:33:42 And then I would really want to meet Sakaguchi one day as well.
00:33:46 And he's a younger man, so I feel like that's pretty doable.
00:33:49 Plus, he's like, he's out there doing his Mist Walker studio stuff.
00:33:52 He's at events.
00:33:53 When I was at Comic-Con, there actually was an event.
00:33:56 Sorry, not Comic-Con.
00:33:57 Anime Expo when I went with Digi.
00:33:59 Like, there was another thing.
00:34:00 If you just waited in line long enough, you got to meet Hirotomo Sakaguchi.
00:34:04 But I was just like, fuck that.
00:34:05 I'm in the building with him.
00:34:06 That counts.
00:34:07 So that's the one I haven't locked eyes on yet.
00:34:09 But that's the trifecta, the Final Fantasy big dicks.
00:34:12 I guess no more meeting him would be kind of cool.
00:34:14 He's made some cool games.
00:34:15 I always feel like when I imagine meeting, I have thought of like,
00:34:20 oh, what if I could meet Jimmy Page?
00:34:22 But then it's like, who am I to him?
00:34:25 I'm just some kid.
00:34:28 What am I going to do?
00:34:30 The only way meeting Jimmy Page would be cool is if I could jam with him
00:34:36 or musically impress him in some way, or just be really cool.
00:34:40 What you did with Lauren Faust.
00:34:42 Giving your card to Lauren Faust, like with your artwork on it for your comic,
00:34:45 that was like, you know, that's like you being like,
00:34:47 hey, I'm not just an asshole, you know,
00:34:49 ooh, I want to suck your dick, Lauren, like everybody else here.
00:34:52 I mean, on the one hand, it's like, it's a power move.
00:34:55 But on the other hand, she was there for a very long time,
00:34:58 and I was the one guy who didn't pay her anything.
00:35:01 So like...
00:35:03 Well, I mean, I don't think she's upset about that.
00:35:05 She'll probably be like, oh yeah, you didn't pay.
00:35:08 Like fuck you, like die, and she rips it in front of me,
00:35:11 throws it in half, throws it in my face.
00:35:13 I mean, Lauren Faust is the person.
00:35:16 Lauren Faust is the person who reached out to the main six guys
00:35:19 who were making Them's Fighting Hooves,
00:35:21 and like offered to do of her own volition character designs
00:35:24 because Hasbro wasn't going to make them.
00:35:26 Them's Fighting Hurts.
00:35:27 Well, it got changed to Them's Fighting Hurts.
00:35:29 No, before it was Fighting His Magic.
00:35:31 No.
00:35:32 Yeah, it was Fighting His Magic, and then it got changed to Them's Fighting Hurts.
00:35:34 It was never Fighting Hooves because that doesn't make any sense.
00:35:37 Oh, oh, Shari, oh, okay, you're right.
00:35:39 You're right, I said the wrong thing.
00:35:41 I wish it was Fighting His Magic became Them's Fighting Hurts.
00:35:44 Right.
00:35:45 So she's like, even though she made like, you know,
00:35:48 pony shit and is a big dick and all that,
00:35:50 and you know, helped make Faust's imaginary friends
00:35:52 and a bunch of other stuff, like she still has that like,
00:35:56 I don't know, came from Tumblr charm, like Rebecca Sugar,
00:35:59 or like she has humble beginnings, you know, like many of us
00:36:02 and can appreciate, I think, people trying to make their bones
00:36:05 in the industry in whatever capacity,
00:36:07 which is, of course, changing all the time.
00:36:09 It's online now more than like TV shows and stuff.
00:36:12 So, yeah, I don't know.
00:36:14 But by the way, I was gonna say, I said before quickly
00:36:17 that I think I'm the reincarnation of Paul McCartney, which I do.
00:36:20 But also, you may notice Paul McCartney is not dead,
00:36:23 but the thing about that is there was a new video this very day,
00:36:28 September 1st, from Kurzgesagt,
00:36:30 which was like an animation of a story by some nibba whose name I forget,
00:36:35 but it was like, it was called The Egg,
00:36:37 and it was basically about how, it was like a story where a guy dies
00:36:41 and he goes to meet God, and he has a chat with God about,
00:36:45 yeah, this is the afterlife, you're gonna get reincarnated.
00:36:48 That's what happens.
00:36:49 And the guy's like, oh, I guess that means like Hinduism
00:36:51 or like Buddhism's right?
00:36:52 And he's like, nah, it's all basically right, whatever, man.
00:36:54 And he gets reincarnated as like a Chinese girl in like 500 AD.
00:36:58 And he's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, you send me back in time?
00:37:00 He's like, well, yeah, because actually what happens is
00:37:03 you're every person who ever existed on planet Earth,
00:37:07 and you're gonna get reincarnated as every single person
00:37:09 who has ever lived and will ever live on Earth.
00:37:12 And once you're done, you will evolve to a God like me,
00:37:15 because actually there's other gods too on this like higher plane.
00:37:18 All of Earth, this entire universe,
00:37:20 exists as an egg for you to have these experiences to transcend
00:37:24 and become like a God like me or something.
00:37:27 And I was wondering, what the fuck is the point of this story?
00:37:30 I don't understand what he's getting at or anything about this
00:37:35 because reincarnation isn't real or maybe I'm just misinformed.
00:37:39 I mean, the story is about something like every story has metaphorical
00:37:43 like connotations in the person who's writing it.
00:37:46 I mean, it's called the egg, right?
00:37:47 Like just a cool uplifting thing.
00:37:48 Yeah, like what if the end of the universe would be nice
00:37:51 and you could, we all turn into one guy, we all returns to nothing.
00:37:55 What if we're all one and the universe is us, man?
00:37:58 This reminds me.
00:37:59 I guess that I think it's an aspirational tale
00:38:01 that maybe our existence has some greater purpose
00:38:03 that we don't understand.
00:38:04 That's probably true.
00:38:05 This reminds me of one of my favorite albums when I was in high school,
00:38:08 Metropolis Part II by a dream theater where Mike Portnoy is from.
00:38:13 And it really annoys me thinking about it
00:38:18 because it kind of seems like cool and inspirational and uplifting.
00:38:21 And it's a story about a rock opera, I guess you could call it,
00:38:27 about a guy goes, he travels through the mind,
00:38:34 through his own memories, he discovers memories of a past life
00:38:39 and he goes back and he solves the murder.
00:38:42 Basically, he just remembers who killed him when he was in a past life
00:38:48 and it solved the murder.
00:38:50 And it's good, I guess, but it has this tone of like,
00:38:54 he has this big revelation, he's like,
00:38:56 oh my god, turns out, yes, everything's gonna be okay
00:39:00 because we don't disappear when we die.
00:39:04 We all reincarnate, we will all live again, right?
00:39:08 Eternity is real.
00:39:09 And it's like, oh, that's great, it's like, wait a minute,
00:39:11 you just made this story up.
00:39:13 This is all fictional evidence of this truth.
00:39:16 If I'm supposed to be uplifted by this revelation,
00:39:20 what am I then to do with the fact that, oh,
00:39:22 all the supposed evidence for this revelation
00:39:24 is just a fictional story that you wrote.
00:39:26 This does not uplift me, actually.
00:39:28 This is just like, sure it would be nice if that were the case, shrug.
00:39:32 There's some things that perhaps was intended
00:39:34 that we can take away from it.
00:39:36 I don't believe in reincarnation, I don't believe in the soul,
00:39:38 I don't believe in any of that, we're sacks of meat.
00:39:40 But actually, I find that Metal Gear Solid 2,
00:39:45 a source of deep inspiration for myself
00:39:47 because while I wanna have kids, pass on my genetic legacy,
00:39:50 that's cool.
00:39:51 But also, perhaps significantly more importantly,
00:39:53 it's the memes, Jack, it's the memes.
00:39:55 Pass on those memes, bro.
00:39:57 Passing along the ideas of ourselves to future generations,
00:40:01 in that sort of way, we can continue our legacy.
00:40:05 So while reincarnation, literally not real as far as I know,
00:40:08 there is a semblance of immortality if we...
00:40:11 When Solid Snake was talking about passing on memes,
00:40:14 he was specifically talking about rare pepe's.
00:40:17 Yeah, pretty much.
00:40:19 It's just this character having...
00:40:21 He's like, after we've gone, the spirit carries on.
00:40:26 This character has this revelation, he's like,
00:40:28 yes, everything's fine because now I know that reincarnation is real.
00:40:32 But I don't know that, I'm just depressed.
00:40:35 I wish I'd had this revelation.
00:40:37 I like to take a charitable interpretation of things.
00:40:38 I'm gonna assume he meant the memes, Jack,
00:40:40 because that's the only thing that makes sense.
00:40:42 You know, I hate this idea that reincarnation
00:40:46 is in any way an uplifting philosophy
00:40:49 because it's fucking horrifying.
00:40:51 No, it would be epic.
00:40:53 In Buddhism, the idea is that you get closer in your body.
00:40:55 Every idea of the afterlife that people can come up with
00:41:00 to try and make it seem less scary
00:41:02 is actually way more scary if you give it even a moment's thought.
00:41:06 Like, oh, okay, life goes forever
00:41:09 because I'm gonna be reincarnated as everyone.
00:41:12 Sure, we're all the universe experiencing itself
00:41:14 and we're all just one soul being reincarnated.
00:41:17 That's great, that's fine and dandy.
00:41:19 So I'm gonna wake up and lose all my memories of being me
00:41:21 and I'm gonna have to be some other fucking Jack off
00:41:23 and probably get tortured to death in a fucking brazen bull
00:41:26 in fucking Rome in, you know, the 5th century.
00:41:28 That's great.
00:41:29 That's a real great fucking afterlife to look forward to
00:41:31 is being every fucking tortured, miserable ape
00:41:34 who ever fucking lived on this horrible planet for all time.
00:41:37 Wow, I'm so glad I have the faith in reincarnation
00:41:40 to make me feel so much better about death
00:41:42 knowing that I get to suffer for eternity
00:41:44 as other assholes who aren't even me.
00:41:47 Great.
00:41:48 I just came up with a new...
00:41:50 I mean, if you think life is just suffering
00:41:52 then why don't you just kill yourself?
00:41:53 Yeah, well, I mean, life would be suffering
00:41:55 if I were anyone but me.
00:41:57 Okay.
00:41:58 Guys, I know this has been done before
00:42:00 but I just came up with a new,
00:42:02 My Little Pony, Frederick's Magic, OC, the brazen bull.
00:42:05 He's got, you know, he's brazen, he's, you know...
00:42:10 He's just iron will, but recolored, recolored,
00:42:13 and given like sick Pikachu ears and turned yellow
00:42:16 and he's, you know, the greatest character ever conceived.
00:42:19 I just thought of like the most depressing idea
00:42:23 of what happens when you die
00:42:25 is that you don't actually stop existing.
00:42:29 You just do your entire life in reverse
00:42:32 until you're a baby and then you do your life forwards again
00:42:35 and then it just keeps going back and forth.
00:42:38 That's just what Carl Pilkington said.
00:42:41 He said they need to invent.
00:42:43 It's where when you die,
00:42:45 you actually just age in reverse and become a baby.
00:42:47 Is he wrong? You might not like it,
00:42:49 but he's spitting facts, man. These are straight facts.
00:42:52 They really do need to get on that.
00:42:55 He has another like pansy-ass excuse for an afterlife
00:42:58 that I think is lame.
00:43:00 It's when people are like,
00:43:01 oh man, we've got to work on like uploading our consciousness
00:43:04 to computers and stuff
00:43:06 so that we can live forever.
00:43:08 And it's like you fucking idiots.
00:43:10 It's not living forever. It's not your consciousness.
00:43:12 It's a copy. I don't want some fucking copy of me
00:43:14 living on without the real me.
00:43:16 That would piss me off even more.
00:43:18 I would come back from the grave to kill my copy.
00:43:20 Yeah, right?
00:43:22 I'm with you. I'm with you on that.
00:43:24 There's no immortality for us unless we perfect our bodies
00:43:26 in some magical way that we won't.
00:43:28 Play the game Soma, our gamers.
00:43:30 There's always the argument that like,
00:43:32 isn't your brain like copying itself
00:43:34 because the cells die and then get remade
00:43:36 every decade or so?
00:43:38 I think so.
00:43:40 It's an illusion of continuity.
00:43:42 Even if the computers are so perfect
00:43:44 that they can perfectly replicate your brain,
00:43:46 isn't it you?
00:43:48 Yeah, but then that's sort of like a cuck thing.
00:43:50 Like I'm dying and then
00:43:52 my brother is going to take all of my
00:43:54 all of my memories, all of my relationships
00:43:56 and he's going to have all of the good stuff
00:43:58 and he's going to live forever and I'm going to die.
00:44:00 No thanks.
00:44:02 He's going to smash the computer.
00:44:04 He's going to come to life and fuck my wife, thank God.
00:44:06 You know, I have that
00:44:08 existentially horrifying thought
00:44:10 every night just before I fall asleep
00:44:12 of like, what if every night we just die
00:44:14 and then a new me with my memories wakes up in the morning?
00:44:16 A new version wakes up the next day.
00:44:18 I would never know. I would just fucking die forever
00:44:20 and I'd know it would go.
00:44:22 That is in fact what I think is happening already
00:44:24 and I've just accepted that
00:44:26 I'm pretty comfortable with the illusion I got.
00:44:28 Everyone just has like a 24 hour lifespan
00:44:30 I mean, honestly, I think we have
00:44:32 like a quote unquote
00:44:34 lifespan of an infinitesimally
00:44:36 small slice of time and then
00:44:38 that next infinitesimally small slice of time
00:44:40 you are in fact literally a new person
00:44:42 and this just continues.
00:44:44 I mean, I think if you take the idea that your brain
00:44:46 is copying itself to its logical conclusion
00:44:48 like your brain is continually
00:44:50 in flux and like
00:44:52 you at any instant
00:44:54 is not identical to any instant
00:44:56 of you at any other time.
00:44:58 I believe in the immortal soul.
00:45:00 Not for everyone else, just for me.
00:45:02 I'm the only one who has one. That's how I get through life.
00:45:04 That idea of like
00:45:06 dying when you go to bed
00:45:08 has never resonated with me on a like
00:45:10 oh yet dude, I feel the same way
00:45:12 because I've never understood
00:45:14 like if you believe that
00:45:16 then yeah, the logical
00:45:18 like
00:45:20 logical extreme or logical
00:45:22 follow through is that
00:45:24 you're a different person every time you blink
00:45:26 like you die and then you're a different guy
00:45:28 like it's so like
00:45:30 unimportant to anything
00:45:32 that you can completely forget about it. The only reason
00:45:34 it'll freak me out but then
00:45:36 I'll have like a more pressing fear come up
00:45:38 yeah, there's more pressing fears like
00:45:40 there's a bee, there's a fucking bee
00:45:42 oh shit. Yeah, like yeah
00:45:44 like what if a spider touches me while I'm asleep
00:45:46 and I don't know because I'm sleeping. Oh god no!
00:45:48 What if a spider touches me and I become
00:45:50 Spider-Man?
00:45:52 These questions are exactly why
00:45:54 I made the video where I took the little
00:45:56 section of Casey Neistat's video
00:45:58 where he just says, he gets a question
00:46:00 what's the meaning of life and he just says
00:46:02 existentialism is a dangerous thing
00:46:04 like stop thinking about it
00:46:06 and get back to work. Yeah.
00:46:08 Because where are we going with this?
00:46:10 Are you like doing deep...
00:46:12 if you're like a researcher
00:46:14 but that's implied in the work, if you're actually making
00:46:16 meaningful strides on the question
00:46:18 then great, keep doing so. But if you're just some asshole
00:46:20 who can't get to sleep
00:46:22 that's a creepy, weird
00:46:24 utilitarian answer.
00:46:26 I think it's perfectly logical. Casey Neistat
00:46:28 creeps me out. He's got a weird
00:46:30 face. He looks like a rat man.
00:46:32 He is the rat man.
00:46:34 But I feel like
00:46:36 I've listened to this
00:46:38 talk multiple times.
00:46:40 It's a John Cleese talk where he talks about
00:46:44 what was it? The...
00:46:46 Creativity? Yeah, he talks about creativity.
00:46:48 I can't remember the terms. Dude, I watched that again
00:46:50 last week to get myself
00:46:52 to fucking sort myself out
00:46:54 and get myself working on Vapors again
00:46:56 which I did and I have scripts written now.
00:46:58 It talks about
00:47:00 having the playful
00:47:02 mode
00:47:04 and then the serious mode.
00:47:06 You need both. You can't always be
00:47:08 utilitarian because
00:47:10 then you'll never think of anything interesting
00:47:12 or come to good solutions to problems
00:47:14 and you'll just live your life
00:47:16 doing the same thing every day.
00:47:18 And you can't be thinking
00:47:20 like pondering
00:47:22 and being creative all the time because then
00:47:24 you'll get into existential dread and then
00:47:26 you'll come up with ideas and just wallow
00:47:28 wallow in your
00:47:30 fucking big mean
00:47:32 thoughts that you're having. So you've got
00:47:34 to cordon them off so that they're separate
00:47:36 and figure out how to get into
00:47:38 one and then get out of it
00:47:40 and then get into the other one. Makes sense.
00:47:42 And it's
00:47:44 very important to have both.
00:47:46 You know what Casey Neistat looks like?
00:47:48 He looks like a wet koala.
00:47:50 You know, he does swim quite a lot.
00:47:52 He's always jumping in pools.
00:47:54 That's true.
00:47:56 Even when he's not wet, I mean
00:47:58 the shape of his face is like a wet face.
00:48:00 He does look like
00:48:02 a goblin. He's definitely
00:48:04 some sort of ghoul or ghast from
00:48:06 the grave.
00:48:08 I just want to shame
00:48:10 Casey Neistat now. I just want to be a
00:48:12 shit commenter. You know what?
00:48:14 I've really
00:48:16 I need to apologize to everyone
00:48:18 ever because I've
00:48:20 discovered the joys of being a shit
00:48:22 commenter. And it's completely
00:48:24 turned my life around.
00:48:26 Because
00:48:28 I don't know how it happened. I think I got subscribed
00:48:30 to some channel by accident.
00:48:32 Some like
00:48:34 fucking screen rant or something.
00:48:36 This is like these inane
00:48:38 theories about movies that are like
00:48:40 clearly not the intention. It's just fucking filling
00:48:42 the air with vapid noise
00:48:44 to fucking, you know, get their clip quotas.
00:48:46 It's all stuff like fucking like
00:48:48 what if Rick is secretly Morty?
00:48:50 What if
00:48:52 Luke is a ghost the whole
00:48:54 time in the movie and not just
00:48:56 at the end?
00:48:58 That would mean he's his own grandpa
00:49:00 like that song. Also like Futurama.
00:49:02 What if Rick
00:49:04 and Morty, Star Wars, Stranger
00:49:06 Things, Squarespace,
00:49:08 NordVPN guys
00:49:10 Why and why is there a stop sign
00:49:12 in the Aladdin Sega Genesis game?
00:49:14 And like
00:49:16 time paradox. Every time that one of
00:49:18 these comes up in my feed, I click
00:49:20 on it and I watch like the first two
00:49:22 seconds of it and I just have this
00:49:24 overwhelming like this cathartic
00:49:26 need to just type like
00:49:28 you make me want to kill myself
00:49:30 with these fucking just the titles of these videos
00:49:32 alone make me want to fucking die
00:49:34 stop it kill yourself stop die
00:49:36 die die die like I get it now
00:49:38 like I totally get it I've just become
00:49:40 a shit commenter and I'm embracing it
00:49:42 I mean I definitely understand that as well
00:49:44 like it's not even that
00:49:46 you want them to understand you just want to say
00:49:48 shit bad because you want them to see
00:49:50 that someone didn't like it yeah
00:49:52 like I know I know I subscribed
00:49:54 to it I guess you could
00:49:56 say it's my fault but like even if I wasn't
00:49:58 subscribed to it it would still exist and so
00:50:00 it would still be a problem yeah that's why I feel like I
00:50:02 have to be subscribed I have to be the watcher on the
00:50:04 wall to see these fucking videos come
00:50:06 up so I can just see them and know that
00:50:08 they exist and that this is the bad
00:50:10 that exists in the world I have to always
00:50:12 be aware that the world is a bad place
00:50:14 because what if Rick and Morty
00:50:16 Stranger Things 11
00:50:18 Star Wars what if they were all the same
00:50:20 guy nor
00:50:22 VPN guys you know unfortunately
00:50:24 the commenters are mostly
00:50:26 like I disagree for some
00:50:28 very specific lore reason not
00:50:30 you know what you're doing here is damaging
00:50:32 the human race and the human experience you know those
00:50:34 comments the comments that try
00:50:36 to be constructive on those types
00:50:38 of completely terrible videos like you know
00:50:40 they'll never learn that they're doing
00:50:42 this because it yeah they're not made to be
00:50:44 good try stop trying to be constructive
00:50:46 they don't care I would love if there was
00:50:48 like a like a guy
00:50:50 like literally a watcher on the wall who
00:50:52 just goes on every bad video
00:50:54 and types video bad if it's
00:50:56 bad and then he like becomes
00:50:58 like a like a like everyone
00:51:00 like that one guy Justin why or whatever
00:51:02 who's on every yeah so someone like that who
00:51:04 becomes infamous for like making
00:51:06 making it like labeling the videos
00:51:08 as bad and then
00:51:10 people just suddenly you know you get
00:51:12 million upvotes we should make an account
00:51:14 eventually there will be a million
00:51:16 eventually there will be a million accounts of that
00:51:18 it'll be like a movement of all of our watchers
00:51:20 on the wall you know protecting the
00:51:22 internet let's make a fucking
00:51:24 let's make a fucking account on the pcb
00:51:26 called commenter on the wall with like a certain
00:51:28 icon and make that icon like
00:51:30 a link to that picture in the description
00:51:32 of that channel or whatever so everyone
00:51:34 can go download it and make a channel exactly
00:51:36 the same way and we can all be the commenter
00:51:38 on the wall except once you make it everybody
00:51:40 the pcp is now officially
00:51:42 pro bad comments
00:51:44 finally
00:51:46 thank god did you isn't here to fight back
00:51:48 this is the arc of the whole show we've done it
00:51:50 we've done a heal turn full circle
00:51:52 or is this full circle
00:51:54 we went from the heal to the hero like a
00:51:56 double baby face turn
00:51:58 we're a bad baby right now
00:52:00 we're a bad dragon
00:52:02 god fucking screen rent you know
00:52:04 I think I subscribed to this because I think it's
00:52:06 the channel
00:52:08 there's this one guy on this channel
00:52:10 or some channel like it that does like
00:52:12 these like movie
00:52:14 pitch meeting videos that are like sort of
00:52:16 popular there's like 500 of them
00:52:18 they're all the exact same video but they're kind
00:52:20 of funny okay you know it's like
00:52:22 they all start the same it's
00:52:24 like a guy pitching a movie to like another guy
00:52:26 played by himself they start the same
00:52:28 they end the same but there's like little jokes
00:52:30 and like observations about the movie they're kind of like
00:52:32 little like reviews but like
00:52:34 done in a unique way you got a link to
00:52:36 any of them yeah I mean just type in
00:52:38 pitch meeting you'll find a thousand of them okay
00:52:40 so like I got into that guy
00:52:42 and it was you know I watched like a
00:52:44 bunch of them and they're really funny and they're really
00:52:46 cool I like the guy but like I started
00:52:48 to notice like an insidious
00:52:50 thing creeping into the videos
00:52:52 which is like
00:52:54 um catchphrase creep
00:52:56 it's it that's my new fucking term for
00:52:58 a thing that I hate because like
00:53:00 man nice catchphrase
00:53:02 yeah it started off
00:53:04 you know it like the beginnings are the same
00:53:06 and the ends are the same but everything in the middle
00:53:08 was unique but over time
00:53:10 he would say things that commenters would say
00:53:12 I like the way you said that so he'd like keep
00:53:14 saying it so like he keeps
00:53:16 he keeps gaining more and more catchphrases
00:53:18 every couple of months okay
00:53:20 so like and one of them he must have said
00:53:22 like hey this will be super easy
00:53:24 barely an inconvenience so then that
00:53:26 became a catchphrase so he works that joke
00:53:28 into every video and then the one he has
00:53:30 the other guy go like oh
00:53:32 thing is tight this is tight
00:53:34 and then that became a catchphrase and now that's
00:53:36 what they tell you to do and like the youtube
00:53:38 like god I'm sure it is
00:53:40 YouTube Academy or whatever it's like it's like
00:53:42 create little in jokes with your audience
00:53:44 or whatever yeah so then that's too
00:53:46 and then recently he started going oh I
00:53:48 need you to get all the way off my back
00:53:50 about this and then that became a catchphrase
00:53:52 so now like it's just like it's at a point now
00:53:54 where he's at like critical mass where
00:53:56 every fucking line in the videos is a
00:53:58 catchphrase they are they've become completely
00:54:00 about to collapse into a catchphrase black hole
00:54:02 yeah he's like he's slowly
00:54:04 he's draining himself
00:54:06 of all of his creativity and all
00:54:08 of his like observational humor
00:54:10 it's all just being replaced slowly
00:54:12 by catchphrases and now the entire video
00:54:14 is just
00:54:16 oh that thing is tight I need to get all
00:54:18 the way off my back about this super easy
00:54:20 barely an inconvenience
00:54:22 and everyone in the comments just types
00:54:24 the thing he said again like oh
00:54:26 he said that thing again
00:54:28 like the videos are just like ruined
00:54:30 now it's just like
00:54:32 the insidious cancer of
00:54:34 catchphrases creeping into everything
00:54:36 even remotely interesting or unique
00:54:38 and ruining it I could see that
00:54:40 ah youtube
00:54:42 fucking youtube man I can't
00:54:44 take it anymore these these thumbnails
00:54:46 alone I'm noticing a pattern of they just take
00:54:48 a picture and make the eyes really big
00:54:50 and also the mouth sometimes that's I mean
00:54:52 that's just loving that that's like
00:54:54 that's like a gaming the algorithm
00:54:56 taken to its logical extreme
00:54:58 you got the title season 8
00:55:00 you make the face as big as possible
00:55:02 big eyes because big eyes are endearing
00:55:04 or whatever and eventually they will
00:55:06 all just be the exact same script
00:55:08 he won't even be talking just like changing
00:55:10 the name of the movie and the exact same
00:55:12 video
00:55:14 all the way up my back
00:55:16 yeah
00:55:18 I want to see youtube thumbnails
00:55:20 go to the point where it's like
00:55:22 it's just
00:55:24 just a big face
00:55:26 but photoshopped to be grotesque
00:55:28 and then with a like a color
00:55:30 in the background and then a one
00:55:32 and then for the youtube that's the first
00:55:34 video yeah then the it's the exact same
00:55:36 face but with a two
00:55:38 in a different color and then they just
00:55:40 do that forever
00:55:42 that sounds great it sounds like
00:55:44 right right now it sounds like the
00:55:46 present I have ideas like to just
00:55:48 people and you like you know like
00:55:50 totally like off the wall
00:55:52 fucking like to just make like make a
00:55:54 real video like a long
00:55:56 an actual sincere
00:55:58 think piece on something and have it like
00:56:00 be like a real video but just make the
00:56:02 thumbnail like literally a picture of a
00:56:04 guy's thumbnail and like not
00:56:06 explain it at all there's got to be
00:56:08 yeah I mean that would probably just
00:56:10 get you views and then people stick
00:56:12 around because it was a good video
00:56:14 probably probably god
00:56:16 I hate that that would probably work
00:56:18 or just like or just name it like fucking
00:56:20 youtube video and just
00:56:22 like it it's like a real video about a
00:56:24 real thing but you wouldn't know it because it just says youtube
00:56:26 video and it's a picture of a guy's thumb
00:56:28 and then you click on it and it's like a fucking
00:56:30 like a five hour is it a thumbs
00:56:32 up reminding me to like subscribe
00:56:34 and click up no just just a guy
00:56:36 we maybe he's got like a hang nail like
00:56:38 hanging off his thumb so you really
00:56:40 get that if this is a fucking thumbnail
00:56:42 but I guarantee I mean because I'm doing it
00:56:44 right now I'm speculating about the deeper
00:56:46 meaning of this thumbnail even though the whole
00:56:48 concept is that it has no deeper meaning
00:56:50 but I would you know what they might as well
00:56:52 just be honest and have every single thumbnail
00:56:54 for every single video from now on be a
00:56:56 picture of like the logo for Squarespace
00:56:58 or Nord VPN or Harry's
00:57:00 Razors or some fucking stupid
00:57:02 shit like that that they have to fucking
00:57:04 I've seen videos where like they say it
00:57:06 three times in one video like at the beginning
00:57:08 the middle and the end or
00:57:10 and like the same one too
00:57:12 I'm so sick of it
00:57:14 these fucking I don't I don't blame them
00:57:16 for this but I do hate it and like
00:57:18 look at this next one I just look at the thumbnail
00:57:20 I'm not looking at this video but it's I know Captain
00:57:22 Midnight's Game of Thrones Game of Thrones season 8
00:57:24 is a train wreck it's just big Tyrion
00:57:26 solid color big words
00:57:28 I mean I don't have any better
00:57:30 ideas for a thumbnail but
00:57:32 does this not just strike something
00:57:34 deep inside like oh it's just
00:57:36 homogenized like they all are going to
00:57:38 look like that eventually okay
00:57:40 okay so my the
00:57:42 Sonichu lecture has been getting more views
00:57:44 than than than usual
00:57:46 lately and I was considering
00:57:48 if maybe alright so the thumbnail is like
00:57:50 it's my face Sonichu
00:57:52 and my logo
00:57:54 right and I was wondering if
00:57:56 maybe it would be like more clickable
00:57:58 maybe it would be better if I changed it
00:58:00 it's like having my logo there doesn't really add
00:58:02 to clickability it's just there because there was space
00:58:04 like what if I
00:58:06 just put like a big big bold text
00:58:08 that said like Sonichu 101 or something
00:58:10 like I feel like that might be more
00:58:12 I mean that would definitely be a good idea
00:58:14 I think to get more people
00:58:16 clicking it seems like
00:58:18 I mean I think generally it's better to have
00:58:20 the thumbnail be more about the thing than
00:58:22 about you because nobody cares about that
00:58:24 that's just sort of the problem isn't it
00:58:26 if everyone's becoming homogenous then
00:58:28 you you will retain no viewers
00:58:30 like people will come and view it
00:58:32 but nobody will subscribe because it's all
00:58:34 everyone's all the same
00:58:36 that's also true
00:58:38 I wouldn't take my face off there
00:58:40 I would just maybe cover the logo because I don't know if the logo really
00:58:42 accomplishes anything
00:58:44 and I feel like text is
00:58:46 I mean the logo is a brand and it's you
00:58:48 I don't know why would you get rid of it
00:58:50 if you don't need to
00:58:52 you know it's like the
00:58:54 eternal curse of my
00:58:56 stolen by everyone in the fucking world
00:58:58 like updates video right which has been
00:59:00 uploaded to Facebook pages
00:59:02 thousands of YouTube channels usually with
00:59:04 you know with my name taken off sometimes with the whole
00:59:06 entire punchline cut out for some
00:59:08 fucking reason you know always in like
00:59:10 240p you know terrible fucking
00:59:12 quality you know when my
00:59:14 fucking original version is still up there
00:59:16 and like on
00:59:18 YouTube now there's an option I found out
00:59:20 we can click and see like all the people who
00:59:22 have been content match to your
00:59:24 video really a big list
00:59:26 and I clicked on that the other day and just like
00:59:28 it was just an endless wall
00:59:30 of my video uploaded by
00:59:32 like thousands of channels
00:59:34 over and over again and
00:59:36 so many of them have
00:59:38 like higher view counts than my
00:59:40 original video and the reason they
00:59:42 have higher view counts is because the original
00:59:44 video has a real name and
00:59:46 a real thumbnail that no one fucking cares
00:59:48 about and all the fucking reuploads
00:59:50 and stolen versions are called like
00:59:52 man man at windows
00:59:54 10 wow windows 10 updates
00:59:56 really bad frowny face
00:59:58 and it's just like a man
01:00:00 n-word video mad
01:00:02 Obama fuck you Obama
01:00:04 in all caps like totally ruining the
01:00:06 joke yeah like sucking all the humor
01:00:08 out of it yeah because these fucking people
01:00:10 don't understand humor and don't understand
01:00:12 the fucking comedy of the video
01:00:14 so they just want to suck it out completely
01:00:16 with their inane fucking titles
01:00:18 that ruin it but those are the
01:00:20 titles that people click on this is a fascinating
01:00:22 concept no thumbnail just up just
01:00:24 the image from the video that's what people are clicking
01:00:26 on just inane fucking bullshit and
01:00:28 meanwhile the original my comedy
01:00:30 that only exists because of me because
01:00:32 I am funny because I am a fucking
01:00:34 improvisational god damn comedy
01:00:36 mastermind you know yeah
01:00:38 I'm getting I should be I should
01:00:40 literally be a millionaire from
01:00:42 that video alone because it has been seen and clicked
01:00:44 on billions of times
01:00:46 but it's all just everybody else's
01:00:48 bullshit clickbait versions of it
01:00:50 and not the original and I've made
01:00:52 fucking nothing off of it can't
01:00:54 you on in that list of things
01:00:56 can you not like try to claim
01:00:58 uh add revenue from
01:01:00 them or something
01:01:02 yeah you can't know you can you can
01:01:04 claim them and you can take it down
01:01:06 and like in the beginning
01:01:08 when I first saw people stealing
01:01:10 it everywhere I would do that I would take it down
01:01:12 but they just fucking beat me down
01:01:14 they wore me down because it was too much to keep
01:01:16 up with you cannot keep taking
01:01:18 them down it's is it just an endless
01:01:20 ocean of it so I just gave up after
01:01:22 a while like fuck okay
01:01:24 you win internet it belongs to everyone
01:01:26 I guess you've taken my art
01:01:28 and you've taken my comedy and you've sucked
01:01:30 all the fucking life out of it you sucked
01:01:32 all the joy and fun out of it and you can
01:01:34 just have it now congratulations
01:01:36 you took something funny and you fucking ruined
01:01:38 it good job people
01:01:40 of earth let's not forget I mean this
01:01:42 video is one minute and
01:01:44 48 seconds long if there's not
01:01:46 that much to like clip out and
01:01:48 you know make it so like if you had like
01:01:50 I get why people take hour-long
01:01:52 podcasts and cut like five-minute
01:01:54 sections I mean guys like Joe Rogan do this
01:01:56 and they but they have a channel where they
01:01:58 upload their own highlights which seems
01:02:00 like the reasonable we have one too on the
01:02:02 PCB very rarely used it seems
01:02:04 reasonable like I I don't
01:02:06 I don't find it crazy for other people to
01:02:08 upload like I did with Casey Neistat
01:02:10 took like a long video took five seconds
01:02:12 and look I I pretty sure I did
01:02:14 monetize it but if he objected I
01:02:16 whatever man that's on him but
01:02:18 I feel the context is different
01:02:20 this is a very short video
01:02:22 and I have no moral objection to anyone
01:02:24 like like
01:02:26 demanding ownership of their property in this
01:02:28 way and I feel it too my my galco
01:02:30 video was uploaded a million other places
01:02:32 I have not looked into this tool to see how
01:02:34 many content IDs it be I'd be very curious
01:02:36 to do so but
01:02:38 yeah I feel I feel like it's kind of like
01:02:40 places like the New York Times
01:02:42 have like investigative journalism
01:02:44 and they actually sent out reporters like
01:02:46 you know really do news work
01:02:48 I'm not defying them I'm just saying this is a fact
01:02:50 and then like all these
01:02:52 outlets across the entire fucking world
01:02:54 they like you know reference the article
01:02:56 they clip it they capture some piece of it
01:02:58 and they say and we're reporting what's
01:03:00 New York Times reported this what's wrong
01:03:02 with the New York Times
01:03:04 well I have no feelings one way
01:03:06 or another but like there's
01:03:08 it's just that they are doing the groundwork
01:03:10 and the people are profiting
01:03:12 off their work and I don't know
01:03:14 maybe there's some sighting going on I doubt
01:03:16 I don't know why you had to clarify I'm not
01:03:18 I'm saying they do real news
01:03:20 but I'm not defending them Ben the point is who cares
01:03:22 I don't care the point is
01:03:24 that people are profiting off other people's work
01:03:26 and I like is this
01:03:28 just the natural progression of the internet
01:03:30 feels kind of shitty when people can just take
01:03:32 your stuff I mean it makes me feel like
01:03:34 if you can't beat them join them like I might as well
01:03:36 make a bunch of dummy accounts and upload
01:03:38 my own video with a bunch of stupid clickbait titles
01:03:40 it's like and reap all that
01:03:42 you know I might as well just like change
01:03:44 the title to something more clickbaity anyway
01:03:46 since everyone else is going to fucking reap the profits
01:03:48 off my shit by doing that anyways
01:03:50 it's you know and they all fucking just
01:03:52 they just ruin it because people are so fucking
01:03:54 ignorant and they just like
01:03:56 this like death of the author shit of everyone
01:03:58 trying to like title it whatever they want
01:04:00 and change the fucking point of the video
01:04:02 where they call it like Windows 10 rant
01:04:04 it's not Windows 10
01:04:06 every fucking comment every fucking person
01:04:08 who uploads it man mad at
01:04:10 Windows 10 because they can't fucking
01:04:12 fathom that every operating
01:04:14 system does this you know it's
01:04:16 Windows 8 in the video that's what I'm using
01:04:18 I didn't fuck you know but
01:04:20 it's just like oh Windows
01:04:22 something about that just fucking annoys the shit out of me
01:04:24 that they're just ignorant and wrong about it
01:04:26 in such a small way but it drives me fucking
01:04:28 crazy and then like the other
01:04:30 thing is when they like they put the punchline
01:04:32 in the title like Obama
01:04:34 you nigger and it's like
01:04:36 mm-hmm yeah that's not the
01:04:38 fucking like that's not the funny part
01:04:40 the funny part is that it builds to that
01:04:42 because I'm angry and angrier
01:04:44 and angrier and then I say something offensive
01:04:46 and then the punchline is saying
01:04:48 I'm a racist you made me a racist
01:04:50 it's that's the shame of it the punchline
01:04:52 is saving it with my
01:04:54 shame you know
01:04:56 and I if it just
01:04:58 ended on the n-word I wouldn't have
01:05:00 ever uploaded it because that's not fucking funny
01:05:02 it's just fucking weird and racist
01:05:04 mm-hmm you made me a racist
01:05:06 is the funny part and people I've seen that
01:05:08 I've seen it uploaded with like that part
01:05:10 cut out or like with the n-word
01:05:12 censored which just ruins it
01:05:14 it makes it not funny they
01:05:16 they just take it and they fucking they think they
01:05:18 can dittle with it because they think it's community
01:05:20 property and they can just fiddle with my comedy
01:05:22 and make it less funny
01:05:24 that's what defense me the most is just
01:05:26 making it less funny because
01:05:28 no one is funny no one gets
01:05:30 anything I think the problem is
01:05:32 some things I think qualify
01:05:34 for people to fiddle around with in some ways
01:05:36 I don't know I'm happy to take
01:05:38 pieces of things and like edit them together
01:05:40 in funny ways or whatever
01:05:42 but but where's the line I mean I there is
01:05:44 no I mean it's clear that the
01:05:46 they just want to profit off of the funny
01:05:48 video yeah they're not trying
01:05:50 they're not trying to do anything creative
01:05:52 well yeah I mean in this case I agree
01:05:54 they just want money from not doing
01:05:56 the work but I mean people just give
01:05:58 themselves license
01:06:00 I don't know there's no
01:06:02 when I feel the same way there's just no
01:06:04 when you're fucking when you are
01:06:06 a creative actually making your
01:06:08 own shit you lose and
01:06:10 for the rest of your life that's the moral
01:06:12 it's like you okay
01:06:14 tons of the profit will be siphoned away and taken by
01:06:16 other people but like you know you can still
01:06:18 theoretically earn some
01:06:20 revenue on your own are you willing
01:06:22 to do that so that the world
01:06:24 can profit so much beyond what you've
01:06:26 done with your work I mean that's a
01:06:28 question everybody has to make for themselves
01:06:30 or that's to answer for themselves when
01:06:32 they decide to do this because that's what's going to happen
01:06:34 and frankly like I
01:06:36 I'm not like I do
01:06:38 have some self-awareness of the fact that
01:06:40 like okay I guess
01:06:42 this video makes me
01:06:44 a nigger guy forever
01:06:46 like I get like
01:06:48 I'm not exactly happy
01:06:50 that the most viewed video
01:06:52 on my channel on the front page
01:06:54 is forever going to be a fuck
01:06:56 updates but at the same time
01:06:58 not bats oh wait that's on the other channel right
01:07:00 yeah but at the same time I don't want to take it down
01:07:02 either because it has to be up so that people can
01:07:04 know where the original is because it's been everywhere
01:07:06 so it's like
01:07:08 this weird mode where I'm like
01:07:10 normally if it had just been like a video
01:07:12 that got 10,000 views or whatever
01:07:14 you know eventually I might have been like okay
01:07:16 this is an old fucking video
01:07:18 it's fucking I'm embarrassed by it now
01:07:20 you know unlisted or something
01:07:22 so now it's like I'm simultaneously
01:07:24 I'm embarrassed
01:07:26 enough about it but also proud enough
01:07:28 about it that it can never be taken down
01:07:30 I know what you mean I know what you mean
01:07:32 my lolly is the greatest love of all
01:07:34 video yeah I don't even think it's like an amazing
01:07:36 video but like I'm not just going to take
01:07:38 it down because because because what
01:07:40 like yeah like I know someday
01:07:42 someone is going to try to ruin
01:07:44 my whole life and career and because oh he's
01:07:46 called Obama the n-word
01:07:48 in fucking 2010 in a windows
01:07:50 ranch or something but like I mean
01:07:52 yeah okay it's a little embarrassing
01:07:54 I take it down but you know what
01:07:56 it's also funny and it's also
01:07:58 mine and the principle of the matter is
01:08:00 that it's mine and so
01:08:02 I can't take it down because
01:08:04 all you motherfuckers are going to steal it
01:08:06 I mean I find it enough to be yeah
01:08:08 there could be a social cost to pay perhaps
01:08:10 but like it's a joke I'm caught between an n-word
01:08:12 and a hard place
01:08:14 it's a joke I feel the same
01:08:16 about my video it's a joke I mean what
01:08:18 what's the issue here
01:08:20 I don't know
01:08:22 I just hope everyone dies
01:08:24 is the point of all my stories
01:08:26 now that's something we can all get behind
01:08:30 I have another story but if anybody else
01:08:32 wants to bring up anything feel free
01:08:34 well I I fucking
01:08:36 smashed the fasc yesterday
01:08:38 oh yeah tell us
01:08:40 I went to the straight pride rally
01:08:42 to protest oh yes I saw you attending
01:08:44 the the straight pride rally
01:08:46 and we won
01:08:48 and we won and I got a little pepper spray
01:08:50 in my in my mouth
01:08:52 did you get pepper did someone pepper spray you
01:08:54 they I mean they didn't pepper spray me
01:08:56 I was near someone who got pepper spray
01:08:58 and it you know dissipated into the air
01:09:00 and I breathed some of it you know who was
01:09:02 doing that and it was epic
01:09:04 the police yeah yeah
01:09:06 oh okay I thought the oh yeah yeah it was the police
01:09:08 I see I see all right well I guess
01:09:10 I can give like a rundown sure so we
01:09:12 we like um
01:09:14 also munchie and Kazi showed up briefly
01:09:16 that's cool all right at the end
01:09:18 because they were just in the area and they just came
01:09:20 to hang out um so we met up
01:09:22 at and the Boston Common
01:09:24 which is like close to where the parade was
01:09:26 by the way uh so the deal
01:09:28 with this thing is that it was like the
01:09:30 lowest effort like weakest trolling
01:09:32 attempt by the alt right
01:09:34 or whatever it was just
01:09:36 a just like a mean spirited
01:09:38 you know parody of a
01:09:40 gay pride parade and they didn't even try
01:09:42 they rented one float they were like
01:09:44 200 guys tops
01:09:46 that showed up for them we outnumbered them
01:09:48 like 10 to 1 uh
01:09:50 literally epic so so you you're saying
01:09:52 this is a shitposting attempt basically
01:09:54 that was the thrust this is this is this is
01:09:56 a shitposting attempt and I'm kind
01:09:58 of and I'm mad and I'm mad that they got a
01:10:00 permit for it because it's so
01:10:02 stupid and it was so
01:10:04 like lazily done and poorly thought out
01:10:06 and just such an obviously bad
01:10:08 event like I wouldn't care
01:10:10 what was the float the float just said
01:10:12 Trump 2020 uh so
01:10:14 it didn't even have anything to do with being straight
01:10:16 now you see you know you know
01:10:18 stupid here's the thing I think the straight
01:10:20 pride parade could be really funny
01:10:22 if someone who was funny did it
01:10:24 they could make it in a really funny way
01:10:26 um like
01:10:28 I don't know like making
01:10:30 floats that are just like make that are
01:10:32 like making jokes about like being
01:10:34 vanilla or something like maybe a float
01:10:36 that's just like a loaf of white bread
01:10:38 or something or I don't know
01:10:40 something something like you know that's
01:10:42 someone else could have a better idea but just like
01:10:44 you could do like a satirical way and it would be funny
01:10:46 and maybe I would like it but this was
01:10:48 just boring and just uh just
01:10:50 you know just mean spirit and bad
01:10:52 so like I don't think they should have got a
01:10:54 permit I'm annoyed that they got a permit I'm
01:10:56 annoyed that the police showed up to like
01:10:58 such stalwart defense for this stupid
01:11:00 event I'm just curious
01:11:02 why do you say it was mean spirited
01:11:04 why do I say it was mean spirited
01:11:06 yes what
01:11:08 how could it be anything else
01:11:10 okay gotcha
01:11:12 like like
01:11:14 no I mean that like I believe you
01:11:16 like the the the
01:11:18 you're like it's
01:11:22 how do I even put it how do I even put into words
01:11:24 um like
01:11:26 straight people don't need a pride parade straight people
01:11:28 are not are not oppressed they claim like the
01:11:30 people organizing a claim to be the oppressed
01:11:32 majority which is like
01:11:34 like they can't possibly really believe
01:11:36 that I agree this is just this is
01:11:38 this is the this is the like oh they
01:11:40 it's a it's a it's a spite parade
01:11:42 it is yes it is a spite it was a spite
01:11:44 right but anyway we all met up at the
01:11:46 at the commons and you know we fucked around
01:11:48 we all got along on the streets we waited for
01:11:50 the parade to start there were so many cops
01:11:52 there were so many fucking cops
01:11:54 out they were like riding down the
01:11:56 street on their motorcycles and like blaring
01:11:58 their sirens even though nothing was happening
01:12:00 just to like I don't know
01:12:02 subdue of the crowd or something with like
01:12:04 ear damaging levels of noise
01:12:06 um they did all that
01:12:08 the parade started it lasted like a minute
01:12:10 because there were like 200 guys in one float
01:12:12 and like one car
01:12:14 um we followed they had like oh
01:12:16 Milo Yiannopoulos was there he was on the float
01:12:18 I see he was
01:12:20 he was wearing a MAGA hat blowing kisses to
01:12:22 the crowd so a gay man was
01:12:24 on the float of a straight pride parade
01:12:26 well not just any gay man
01:12:28 the gay man
01:12:30 yeah yeah
01:12:32 patient zero
01:12:34 for gayness
01:12:38 the origin of the virus
01:12:40 I saw him up there
01:12:42 and then we all kind of just gathered around
01:12:44 they had a police barricade
01:12:46 so many fucking cops they had a police
01:12:48 barricade they did it in like the city hall
01:12:50 plaza we couldn't hear them
01:12:52 they were they had like there was a
01:12:54 stage and there were speakers but like
01:12:56 we could not hear what they were actually saying
01:12:58 and we just like hung around for the whole thing
01:13:00 just booed them a whole lot
01:13:02 you know chanted
01:13:04 that they suck and should go home
01:13:06 um and uh you know
01:13:08 it's pretty good and then
01:13:10 how little do you have to accomplish in life
01:13:12 if you have to be proud of being straight
01:13:14 that's right
01:13:16 right it's really there's really no
01:13:18 there's really no need there's really no need for this
01:13:20 like yeah either it's
01:13:22 you know as it seems
01:13:24 a big shitpost spite parade
01:13:26 or it's incredibly pathetic and should be
01:13:28 mocked anyway
01:13:30 I think it was mostly the latter
01:13:32 and maybe a few people in there
01:13:34 are the former
01:13:36 I mean Milo known provocateur
01:13:38 I mean I don't know how people feel about him
01:13:40 these days haven't heard much about him lately
01:13:42 but I know he's trying to make people mad
01:13:44 I think that probably some of the people were
01:13:46 just like sincerely like
01:13:48 I do feel persecuted for being straight
01:13:50 and those that's just even sadder
01:13:52 that's even sadder to me
01:13:54 boy I was in that float
01:13:56 for me boys
01:13:58 I mean this is just like that
01:14:00 that that thing the the flyers that were going
01:14:02 up okay like technically true
01:14:04 okay technically it's fine to be
01:14:06 proud or whatever of being straight okay like
01:14:08 those posters that we're saying it's okay to be
01:14:10 white okay yes technically we all understand
01:14:12 it's technically fine it is okay
01:14:14 to be white but you know it's it's
01:14:16 clearly in response but we don't need we don't need
01:14:18 to fucking march about it yeah don't you have your
01:14:20 whiteness in my face I'm doing just fine folks
01:14:22 it's just lame everyone's a fucking
01:14:24 loser if you feel oppressed stay in your
01:14:26 fucking house that's the fucking
01:14:28 solution
01:14:30 you don't need to fucking go out on the streets
01:14:32 and be annoying and show everyone what a
01:14:34 fucking sad loser you are by fucking
01:14:36 pick it and this goes for anyone not just
01:14:38 for fucking the people that are that are bad
01:14:40 you know anyone fucking picketing
01:14:42 or making a fucking public disturbance
01:14:44 for any reason anyone going outside
01:14:46 going hey look at me I'm this fucking
01:14:48 group you're all fucking losers just
01:14:50 stay inside and stop bothering normal
01:14:52 people frankly if you're not
01:14:54 making pipe bombs I question your dedication
01:14:56 to the cops I unironically
01:14:58 believe that if you don't have the courage
01:15:00 to fight kill and die for your beliefs
01:15:02 and fuck your beliefs
01:15:04 fuck your group fuck your parades
01:15:06 there enough bunch of fucking losers
01:15:08 yeah so there were 34
01:15:10 arrests I saw maybe like
01:15:12 maybe like 10 of them okay
01:15:14 and I didn't see what any of them were getting
01:15:16 arrested for I just saw people being like
01:15:18 you know like taken away and like
01:15:20 escorted I saw one guy
01:15:22 he was being like four cops
01:15:24 each one was like grabbing one of his
01:15:26 like arms and legs and just like carrying
01:15:28 him like like down the street
01:15:30 I don't know what he did to get it I didn't
01:15:32 see it actually take place I just saw them
01:15:34 carrying him away it was quite a spectacle
01:15:36 the one thing okay at the end
01:15:38 after like the rally was over
01:15:40 you know we all yell and go home and whatever
01:15:42 the rally was over they're all dissipating
01:15:44 that's what I would
01:15:46 and for some reason people kept
01:15:48 hanging out and they just
01:15:50 they didn't leave like the crowd didn't leave
01:15:52 for a while they were still just sort of like waiting
01:15:54 around the barricade
01:15:56 and at this point like the police come in
01:15:58 and they do like a police thing like they're clearing the street
01:16:00 they're clearing the street and some people did
01:16:02 not get out of the street and clear the way
01:16:04 for the police and this is what I this is
01:16:06 when there was pepper spray employed
01:16:08 they just like people wouldn't clear the road
01:16:10 for this police envoy or whatever and
01:16:12 they just they had they had to spray him
01:16:14 and it's it got kind of dicey for a second
01:16:16 it seemed like it seemed like
01:16:18 the crowd all had to like push back from the
01:16:20 street and like it looked like
01:16:22 there was like a brawl breaking out and like it
01:16:24 looked for a minute like there was just going to be like
01:16:26 fighting like breaking out in the sidewalk
01:16:28 have you ever seen like I don't I don't know how much
01:16:30 of this you've ever been to like a big like
01:16:32 potential fighty kind of thing I've never been
01:16:34 in fucking a situation like that in my whole life
01:16:36 one of probably the closest thing
01:16:38 I've been to but but I didn't actually
01:16:40 see the pepper spraying because there was a crowd
01:16:42 but I did I did you know like I heard
01:16:44 people saying they're spraying they're spraying
01:16:46 and then I like breathe something
01:16:48 in and I was like my throat
01:16:50 felt all like weird and spice I was like oh god
01:16:52 I can't I can't breathe right what's going on am I going
01:16:54 to die but it was fine
01:16:56 it wasn't a big it wasn't a big deal
01:16:58 and then but some some guy
01:17:00 some guy who just had like bandanas
01:17:02 you know like the band like the bandanas
01:17:04 people wear over their faces and stuff yeah
01:17:06 yeah and he was and he was just like he had
01:17:08 a box of them and he was like here like put this over
01:17:10 your mouth put this over your mouth and like I took one
01:17:12 and like I was breathing through that for a second
01:17:14 oh it was so during the pepper spray to help people
01:17:16 yeah he was like here breathe
01:17:18 yeah you breathe through this it'll
01:17:20 help maybe quit I don't know if it actually would have
01:17:22 helped breathe this you know
01:17:24 bash the bash and that's
01:17:26 that's all there is to it bash the bash
01:17:28 I don't know by that point the rally was over
01:17:30 so I was just ready to leave
01:17:32 of course the picture you uploaded of
01:17:34 yourself in the in that crowd on that
01:17:36 website yeah I'm really glad
01:17:38 some website I put it on
01:17:40 Twitter some website got a picture that like you can
01:17:42 you can see me
01:17:44 oh yeah Colcorona was there too
01:17:46 Colcorona's there giving the thumbs down
01:17:48 aww that guy he gets around
01:17:50 he's always involved with something interesting
01:17:52 he's having a lot of adventures
01:17:54 he's he's a loose cannon
01:17:56 oh dude that arm band looks like a
01:17:58 fuck what is it it's like a wild cherry
01:18:00 black monster or something
01:18:02 it does yeah if you're right it looks like
01:18:04 you know what maybe Antifa had some
01:18:06 good ideas after all that's all I'm saying
01:18:08 the ultra the ultra black
01:18:10 that's the one that's the one
01:18:12 anyway it was pretty it was
01:18:14 pretty cool it was pretty cool
01:18:16 and um you know some shit
01:18:18 I want to I want to go get
01:18:20 pepper spray I want to be involved with something
01:18:22 that that has violence in it some
01:18:24 some you know some people said like don't show
01:18:26 up like this is what they want and like sure
01:18:28 I kind of agree I think it's
01:18:30 true like they obviously did this with
01:18:32 the intention of trolling
01:18:34 and riling up a big group
01:18:36 to like you know be mad you know triggering the
01:18:38 libs right and I guess
01:18:40 in that way that succeeded I guess this
01:18:42 is probably what they want so much for the tolerant
01:18:44 left here we go once again there
01:18:46 was there was like during there there was a guy
01:18:48 at like because like the police barricade
01:18:50 was like a big sort of space they kept like a
01:18:52 big space clear between like us and
01:18:54 them and there were a couple of people
01:18:56 just like hanging out at the like other
01:18:58 end of the barricade like you know waving straight
01:19:00 pride flags at us there was a guy with a
01:19:02 microphone who kept like yelling stuff at us
01:19:04 but it wasn't loud enough when we couldn't hear
01:19:06 what he was saying so it was I don't know
01:19:08 I don't know what but they were
01:19:10 they were just they were loving the attention
01:19:12 they were loving it it was great so I guess
01:19:14 in a sense this is what they wanted but
01:19:16 I think that the net effect of it
01:19:18 is good and I'm glad that I went because I
01:19:20 think that it's a good thing to show
01:19:22 up and make the statement that like
01:19:24 there's more of us than there are of you
01:19:26 we think you suck we don't want you here
01:19:28 and like hopefully this is like
01:19:30 I mean hopefully this is enough of a disturbance
01:19:32 that they wouldn't grant permission for a similar
01:19:34 shitty event like this in the future
01:19:36 because they're not because like the mayor
01:19:38 said like he oh he had to approve this
01:19:40 event because he had he approves them based
01:19:42 on operational feasibility and not on
01:19:44 politics but like what does that mean
01:19:46 you're obligated to approve a permit
01:19:48 for any event that well I mean can
01:19:50 happen fucking the fucking KKK
01:19:52 were given a thing back in the day and I mean
01:19:54 you know that's like a free speech issue right so I mean
01:19:56 if those guys at some point at
01:19:58 but they had at some point someone has
01:20:00 to have the ability to say
01:20:02 like this event just sucks
01:20:04 well you know it's different actually
01:20:06 they can't they can't I don't know
01:20:08 exactly what the chain of command is that approves
01:20:10 or denies permits for these things but they can't
01:20:12 be obligated to allow
01:20:14 any event that can occur
01:20:16 to occur I was gonna say like
01:20:18 if I submitted one that's like
01:20:20 utterly retarded that has no
01:20:22 basically if I'm sincere in my beliefs
01:20:24 and making it like okay I will the KKK
01:20:26 those guys probably believe what they say
01:20:28 they probably were sincere in their
01:20:30 you know hate to minorities and what not
01:20:32 so that's like a real thing I guess
01:20:34 they're really trying to say but I mean
01:20:36 these guys are far more shit posty
01:20:38 I would imagine but like
01:20:40 maybe they made a good faith argument like
01:20:42 no we are argument at least is we're really
01:20:44 just trying to say it's okay to be straight
01:20:46 which technically fine
01:20:48 so I don't know the logic
01:20:50 they're pretty it's pretty clear
01:20:52 if you read their Facebook page that this is
01:20:54 you know just like a dumb
01:20:56 if I was there I drew down people who seemed like
01:20:58 they were just fucking around yeah and like it's really
01:21:00 like they didn't even make it try to seem like a real thing
01:21:02 and I don't know I really don't buy the excuse that
01:21:04 oh I just had to I don't know
01:21:06 why this got approved and I don't think it should have been
01:21:08 I want to get in on this I want to
01:21:10 you know I think if you
01:21:12 forget everything I said before about if you
01:21:14 take part in either side you're a loser I take it back
01:21:16 I think that if you have the opportunity
01:21:18 to participate in civil unrest
01:21:20 you should take it because it's fucking cool
01:21:22 regardless of what side you're on
01:21:24 you know I want to go to one of these things
01:21:26 and I want to just be holding a sign that says
01:21:28 I'm just here for the violence
01:21:30 I want pepper spray
01:21:32 flying I want bricks
01:21:34 flying I want to be right in the middle
01:21:36 of all of it baby I want to fucking
01:21:38 thing around I want to fucking mask around the bottom
01:21:40 of my face so I look cool I want to fucking
01:21:42 be running around punching random people
01:21:44 in the head oh you know oh getting punched
01:21:46 in the head I don't care either way okay
01:21:48 okay in I just want to say in that picture
01:21:50 with cold corona next to cold corona
01:21:52 is a guy he's got the face mask on he's
01:21:54 wearing sunglasses and the black hat okay
01:21:56 yeah thing about that guy is he was right next
01:21:58 to him you can't really see him but there's like a big
01:22:00 like fat guy who's also in like a black hoodie
01:22:02 and as we're standing in
01:22:04 that line like right across from us was the
01:22:06 police barricade they were like standing
01:22:08 along the parade route preventing us from blocking the street
01:22:10 and these two guys
01:22:12 they were literally doing
01:22:14 like a antifa
01:22:16 Abaddon Costello routine
01:22:18 and they were doing like a little like back
01:22:20 and forth like jokie thing like they were
01:22:22 they were like talking to the cops about like
01:22:24 like oh like you can you like oh you can see
01:22:26 these guys don't want to be here and stuff and they're like
01:22:28 oh look at these I don't know they were just
01:22:30 okay they weren't that funny but what they were attempting
01:22:32 to do was like a sort of
01:22:34 ad hoc comedy Abaddon Costello
01:22:36 they were putting an image in your
01:22:38 brain that you could make funnier and it was
01:22:40 just funny because there was like a tall
01:22:42 skinny one and a short fat one and they were
01:22:44 they were just like they looked
01:22:46 like a they looked like a comedy duo
01:22:48 and I I appreciated
01:22:50 the effort at least you know like I
01:22:52 obviously I'm a man with a lot of
01:22:54 straight pride let me tell you I'm just filled
01:22:56 to the brim with straight pride and
01:22:58 but but you know
01:23:00 like in something like this it does seem to me the guys
01:23:02 are obviously shit posters whatever they don't need to parade
01:23:04 maybe it's fine I don't whatever I don't care
01:23:06 I don't really blame anybody for coming to protest
01:23:08 because obviously it's it's the like
01:23:10 thing of like getting real close
01:23:12 like I'm not touching you I'm not touching you
01:23:14 you're like real close at a certain point
01:23:16 it's just gonna trigger a response and
01:23:18 like I'm happy to see I didn't look at a news reports
01:23:20 everybody here looks pretty reasonable
01:23:22 I don't blame it for booing or anything but like
01:23:24 I see the girl in the front with the like we
01:23:26 support cis people straight people normal
01:23:28 people that's not like saying like fuck
01:23:30 straight people so like
01:23:32 I just seems like a positive
01:23:34 message overall and they're not
01:23:36 you know in any way being overly negative at least
01:23:38 the guy's putting on the guys like
01:23:40 from the tone of the Facebook post and
01:23:42 like the history like the guys the guys
01:23:44 hosting this event are like the same guys
01:23:46 who in 2007 they hosted a quote
01:23:48 unquote free speech rally which was
01:23:50 just a it was just like an alt-right
01:23:52 like trolling event basically they're just
01:23:54 sure they're they're not
01:23:56 they're not they're not good dudes
01:23:58 they're not they're not doing this in good faith
01:24:00 push back against the term alt-right being applied
01:24:02 like is Milo really alt-right I mean he's very
01:24:04 right I'm not even I'm not even talking about Milo
01:24:06 although there's other
01:24:08 I don't like Milo either yeah all right
01:24:10 so so yeah I got pepper sprayed and it was
01:24:12 epic that's my story
01:24:14 regarding the like
01:24:16 giving them what they want though
01:24:18 I feel like
01:24:20 it's so like giving them what they want
01:24:22 is like they want to trigger the left
01:24:24 ease because they think it's funny
01:24:28 allegedly presumably
01:24:30 I think
01:24:32 it's it's so much
01:24:34 like worse to like not
01:24:36 go for fear of making them
01:24:38 laugh like giving them a jolly
01:24:40 yeah like oh
01:24:42 like oh it's kind of no way to win really
01:24:44 no but like the them winning
01:24:46 isn't that much of a big win I think we
01:24:48 want to like the failure it would be
01:24:50 if we just let them do it
01:24:52 yeah yeah if they if they just if we
01:24:54 just let them do it
01:24:56 then like yeah hey cold corona
01:24:58 always picks the winning side
01:25:00 look look I just
01:25:02 I just think it makes the statement the
01:25:04 it's the right statement to make that like
01:25:06 10 times more counter
01:25:08 protesters showed up then like actual
01:25:10 attendees look that's fine
01:25:12 like I'm sure people like Milo will
01:25:14 spin it as like we triggered them
01:25:16 so like it's so few of us triggered them so
01:25:18 I mean what does it really mean but like yeah
01:25:20 it seems fine seems reasonable
01:25:22 well that's the thing I don't blame anyone
01:25:24 for going but just just consider the reality where
01:25:26 like this wouldn't ever happen but imagine
01:25:28 if literally no one showed up to observe
01:25:30 that would itself be a statement that
01:25:32 you know but they would they would then also
01:25:34 spin it as like obviously I see
01:25:36 what I see what you mean like that they
01:25:38 were too scared to come and fight us but
01:25:40 yeah right like it's always gonna be
01:25:42 something yeah I mean you know when you've
01:25:44 got an agenda no matter what side you
01:25:46 find yeah
01:25:48 I mean that would be pretty funny if like
01:25:50 they're like nobody even showed up to
01:25:52 counterprotect but like yeah that wasn't
01:25:54 gonna happen and we're not there yet
01:25:56 like I think in a perfect
01:25:58 in a perfect world probably nobody would
01:26:00 pay any attention to this kind of thing
01:26:02 but like these same these same people
01:26:04 they put on like they said they are
01:26:06 they did another thing like this in 2017
01:26:08 they're gonna like keep doing it yeah
01:26:10 yeah yeah like I said I don't know if I
01:26:12 have any straight pride specifically
01:26:14 but I do know that all of the
01:26:16 pride I do have is very
01:26:18 straight all my pride is very
01:26:20 straight I have no pride
01:26:22 I feel you on that and this was oh and
01:26:24 also while I was there this this is
01:26:26 happened to be the same day that Munchy
01:26:28 was moving into his uh his new dorm
01:26:30 because he's starting college now and I
01:26:32 mm-hmm oh today is the day today's
01:26:34 or was it yesterday yesterday he's
01:26:36 moving and I think yeah yesterday yeah
01:26:38 yesterday moved in when I went and saw
01:26:40 his dorm and you know just saw the play
01:26:42 it's okay I'm really jealous
01:26:44 because he's on like the he's on like
01:26:46 the little like a building with like a
01:26:48 bed and like a floor
01:26:50 okay he can he can literally
01:26:52 see endless war from
01:26:54 his not from his room but from like
01:26:56 right outside his room there's a window
01:26:58 in DC
01:27:00 no the canonical
01:27:02 endless war is the Bunker Hill Monument
01:27:04 oh I gotta google that okay which you
01:27:06 can yeah we visited it at the
01:27:08 rfckcon and
01:27:10 he can see it from his like hallway window
01:27:12 oh my he can fucking see the site
01:27:14 oh wow that does actually fucking look exactly like
01:27:16 it yeah he can fucking
01:27:18 see it from his fucking window every
01:27:20 day yes living in the belly of the
01:27:22 beast now I know or is literally
01:27:24 every day I know I wish
01:27:26 I got I wish that were me
01:27:30 incredible
01:27:32 yeah um well hey that's
01:27:34 that's that's dope but listen people
01:27:36 I have another in the continuing saga
01:27:38 of Nate's
01:27:40 Adventures at Theme Parks
01:27:42 because yesterday I took my
01:27:44 my little old self and Michelle was Michelle's
01:27:46 birthday yesterday and we went
01:27:48 to Coney Island a much smaller
01:27:50 but uh also New York
01:27:52 uh no no there's of course there's Coney
01:27:54 on to New York but this is a little amusement park
01:27:56 based on like
01:27:58 uh named after that but it's just a
01:28:00 fucking amusement park okay it's not is there
01:28:02 just a lot of cones everywhere there's plenty
01:28:04 of cones absolutely um okay
01:28:06 but here's here's the thing hang on let me pull up my
01:28:08 fucking notes it took some notes on this okay here we go
01:28:10 so I'm coming off obviously the
01:28:12 greatest moment in pcp history
01:28:14 my diamondback story forget
01:28:16 brony con forget ben bash in the
01:28:18 it was all about Nate
01:28:20 top diamondback the rockets bursting in
01:28:22 air it was incredible so yesterday
01:28:24 Michelle's like hey let's go to you know for my
01:28:26 birthday let's go to Coney Island have fun okay sounds
01:28:28 great so we go now
01:28:30 this would come to be known later in the
01:28:32 annals of history as
01:28:34 uh uh scholars recount Nate's
01:28:36 story as the day of pain
01:28:38 the day of pain uh as you
01:28:40 know to continue the spirit of munchy
01:28:42 so the first thing that happens in the
01:28:44 day is we're both hungry we get there and we
01:28:46 decide to eat some food now
01:28:48 we cannot find any healthy alternatives
01:28:50 so we get a couple of corn dogs
01:28:52 and we I see I see deep fried
01:28:54 twinkies on the menu
01:28:56 and I just think to myself well I've gotta
01:28:58 buy those I have to get in on this
01:29:00 action so I do uh Michelle
01:29:02 takes like a bite she's like this is disgusting I never want
01:29:04 this near me ever again I so I'm like okay
01:29:06 I'll eat yours and I eat them all I
01:29:08 consume all the fried food this
01:29:10 would throughout throughout the day my
01:29:12 constitution score
01:29:14 dropped like 20 points I am dying
01:29:16 it is don't do it don't
01:29:18 listen to your base or instincts be
01:29:20 an intellectual being and don't eat
01:29:22 fried food ever it's a mistake every time
01:29:24 okay so this is the
01:29:26 so this is the first step in my my path
01:29:28 of pain on the day of pain of me
01:29:30 experiencing agony throughout the entire day
01:29:32 okay um so later on I go
01:29:34 into a bathroom and I just notice that this
01:29:36 is an omen of the future I notice
01:29:38 the words uh fuck
01:29:40 god carved into this to
01:29:42 the wall and also uh
01:29:44 what was it oh there was a swastika next to it
01:29:46 and then also the words tiny
01:29:48 Tim is a fag I don't know
01:29:50 exactly what that was referring to
01:29:52 but oh and I have pictures of it
01:29:54 living in the sunlight loving in the moon
01:29:56 like having a wonderful time
01:29:58 was it was it of course uh our boy the
01:30:00 the Christmas Eve man I I don't know
01:30:02 I'll never know but uh so so
01:30:04 this is again the the the omens the darkness
01:30:06 is continuing to progress
01:30:08 so um let me see where was
01:30:10 I okay so we progress throughout the day
01:30:12 I'm experienced we do all the tilted worlds
01:30:14 all kinds of crazy shit it's it's a bad time
01:30:16 for me my stomach is churning I'm dying
01:30:18 I want to puke but I don't have managed to hold it
01:30:20 off until then until the end here
01:30:22 so the end of the day is coming we're
01:30:24 about to leave I'm still feeling sick
01:30:26 and uh we went to the water park
01:30:28 there and as we are leaving the water park
01:30:30 we're about to leave I did my swimming I'm
01:30:32 having a high I'm feeling good we notice
01:30:34 that there is a diving board
01:30:36 and there's a high dive as well
01:30:38 now I don't know if you guys have been on a high dive before
01:30:40 but it's pretty fucking high
01:30:42 it is like I don't know maybe 10 feet off
01:30:44 the water and I think of myself will obviously
01:30:46 I've got to give this a try
01:30:48 so I go to the high dive it hurts
01:30:50 I do a dive it was fine no big deal
01:30:52 I'm too I'm too pussy to a
01:30:54 fucking normal dive I do a cannonball
01:30:56 cause I don't want to hurt my body
01:30:58 um okay so that went fine
01:31:00 if I were diving off the high I'd be afraid that I would
01:31:02 over correct and like go upside down you know what I mean
01:31:04 indeed like your feet
01:31:06 extend beyond your and you rotate
01:31:08 oh you wouldn't want that one could only
01:31:10 and you land on your back
01:31:12 oh yeah that's that's this is a
01:31:14 nightmare this is a nightmare to be
01:31:16 avoided at all costs so I think
01:31:18 of myself you know what that first cannonball went okay
01:31:20 I think it's time to do an actual dive
01:31:22 so I go I do a dive goes reasonably well
01:31:24 still in pain that's okay now from
01:31:26 this moment on I'm witnessing the little
01:31:28 children are gathering around and they're all
01:31:30 they're not looking at me they're just they're just doing the diving board
01:31:32 and I'm like okay I'm just going to do a couple of dives
01:31:34 for fun off of the
01:31:36 like the lower boards I'm doing this
01:31:38 for a while and then I see the children start
01:31:40 to do flips and I've decided my quest
01:31:42 for the day my diamond back for the day
01:31:44 is to do a flip
01:31:46 is to do a flip off the diving board this
01:31:48 has become my quest
01:31:50 this would result in the
01:31:52 day of pain coming to a gruesome head
01:31:54 one can only imagine
01:31:56 so I'm practicing my flips
01:31:58 I'm doing it over and over I'm getting nowhere
01:32:00 uh one of my early attempts
01:32:02 is is and I'm doing like a twisting
01:32:04 jerking motion I'm scared I'm I'm in
01:32:06 fear now Michelle was actually a diver
01:32:08 for like many years like a swim team
01:32:10 diver so she knows exactly what she's doing
01:32:12 and it's roasting there from the sidelines
01:32:14 you looking real gay out there Nate you
01:32:16 gotta get your shit together and
01:32:18 things of this nature
01:32:20 uh you know when you're doing dives
01:32:22 you're if you hit the water wrong
01:32:24 the the pain the pain begins to
01:32:26 rise and you feel the soreness creeping
01:32:28 all over your body so I'm sick
01:32:30 I'm scared the fear of God
01:32:32 is in me Satan is amongst me and
01:32:34 I'm increasing the damage over my body
01:32:36 but I will not give up because I'm seeing
01:32:38 children of like five years old
01:32:40 do flips all around me and they're having
01:32:42 no trouble whatsoever and so I've
01:32:44 committed I must do a flip
01:32:46 over and over and over again
01:32:48 I think I'm gonna do it Michelle gives me
01:32:50 a couple of pointers I I I managed to
01:32:52 rotate like 80% of a flip
01:32:54 but this results oh no in
01:32:56 you know exactly what you just mentioned
01:32:58 man a big hit the water
01:33:00 no it's my my
01:33:02 side is a shearing red color
01:33:04 Michelle tells me she reports back to me
01:33:06 that at this moment everyone audibly
01:33:08 winces in the in the crowd
01:33:10 gathering around and they see me fuck up
01:33:12 this bad even the lifeguard
01:33:14 even the lifeguard but I've
01:33:16 decided I will I will suffer
01:33:18 the pain I will continue to rack up agony until
01:33:20 I can do this fucking flip like these babies
01:33:22 now I could this continues for another
01:33:24 like I don't know 15 20 minutes of me just
01:33:26 throwing my body over and over again
01:33:28 just my HP bar is depleting slowly
01:33:30 like I've got the poison status
01:33:32 you just kept doing it I just kept doing
01:33:34 it I had to do your HP
01:33:36 bar is depleting but your limit break
01:33:38 bar is rising you know
01:33:40 but you are so right Jesse you are so
01:33:42 right because after after another
01:33:44 big flop a big searing
01:33:46 activity might people can see people don't
01:33:48 want to see a man hurt himself in this way
01:33:50 over and over again at a children's
01:33:52 amusement park so so
01:33:54 nobody wants to see a grown man
01:33:56 cry no no the children
01:33:58 at this point are in fact
01:34:00 cheering me on and they they have taken
01:34:02 notice of my activities and so I
01:34:04 make a little great gang of conspirators
01:34:06 co-conspirators the ones who are good at flipping
01:34:08 they're like dude okay you gotta do it like this
01:34:10 you gotta tuck your body Michelle's giving me advice
01:34:12 and even after a while the lifeguard himself is like
01:34:14 bro you gotta rotate your arms up you gotta
01:34:16 extend your arms to get more momentum
01:34:18 so you'll stop fucking killing yourself
01:34:20 what an event the whole
01:34:22 community got involved in my quest
01:34:24 Michelle's just sitting there I come to sit down
01:34:26 for a while she's like you cannot sit next
01:34:28 to me until you pull off this fucking flip get the
01:34:30 fuck out there you are embarrassing me in front
01:34:32 of everyone okay you got it chief
01:34:34 so I go back to work
01:34:36 now okay eventually
01:34:38 that trick about the arms extending
01:34:40 that the the fucking
01:34:42 lifeguard gave me it finally bore
01:34:44 fruit my limit bar was had its max I
01:34:46 had finally learned the technique I tuck
01:34:48 my legs up I do my arms
01:34:50 extended upward and I do a flawless
01:34:52 perfect like
01:34:54 I don't know 360 degree
01:34:56 rotation jump into the water
01:34:58 everyone's like Nate you are the coolest fucking
01:35:00 guy you fucking did it
01:35:02 lookin good Nate and at this
01:35:04 point frankly lads I'm cocky
01:35:06 as hell my limit bar is still
01:35:08 full so I think you know what
01:35:10 let's get back on that fucking high dive my dude
01:35:12 I know the technique I do
01:35:14 a correct flip one time and I think to myself
01:35:16 I'm a master
01:35:18 easy shit easy I have literally
01:35:20 achieved god mode
01:35:22 fuck this I'm going back high
01:35:24 so just like a fucking sultan I strut
01:35:26 up to the high dive
01:35:28 I fucking run off that shit I do
01:35:30 I use all the techniques I've learned
01:35:32 away I'm sorry I forgot I forgot before
01:35:34 before I get to that in the middle
01:35:36 of my of my session the lowest point
01:35:38 as I was I was on my learning
01:35:40 montage there's a moment where
01:35:42 I've learned a couple of skills I've done this a couple times
01:35:44 I'm getting to the end of the board
01:35:46 but all of a sudden panic strikes me as
01:35:48 I'm afraid that I'm gonna fuck it up and increase my pain
01:35:50 it's just the agony is gonna rise over and over
01:35:52 and as I'm I'm like I've got like one
01:35:54 toe loony tune style I'm dangling off
01:35:56 the end I'm trying to pull myself out so I can
01:35:58 fix my posture and I just yell to the heavens
01:36:00 I'm gonna goof it
01:36:02 and then I slowly tumble off
01:36:04 the edge and fall and this was the
01:36:06 this was whenever this is the big the big flop
01:36:08 that no one was no one was on my side
01:36:10 but as I said
01:36:12 I immediately turned against you started
01:36:14 pelting you with garbage that's exactly
01:36:16 what happened okay but as I said
01:36:18 I eventually I managed to do one solid
01:36:20 flip and I'm cocky as hell so I go off to the high dive
01:36:22 okay I'm on the high dive
01:36:24 everyone's cheering the applause
01:36:26 everyone's saying this is the boy this is the golden man
01:36:28 he did one flip and meanwhile
01:36:30 there was like this girl who did like triple fucking front flips
01:36:32 and pirouettes off the fucking
01:36:34 thing it was embarrassing nonetheless
01:36:36 now is my time to shine I go
01:36:38 I climb the high dive I attempt
01:36:40 to do the perfect dive
01:36:42 I've studied the techniques I know what I'm doing now
01:36:44 I feel myself launching off the
01:36:46 end of the board I'm rotating into
01:36:48 midair 90 degrees 180 degrees
01:36:50 what's after that
01:36:52 270 360 but
01:36:54 but oh god
01:36:56 I'm still going I haven't hit I'm
01:36:58 overcorrecting I'm still rotating
01:37:00 my back is literally 180
01:37:02 degree parallel to the water down below
01:37:04 I
01:37:06 I rotate once more or something like
01:37:08 that and my my I feel myself
01:37:10 time stops I am floating
01:37:12 spread eagle arms
01:37:14 wide legs wide hanging
01:37:16 floating one inch above the water
01:37:18 a perfect belly flop position
01:37:20 and then time begins
01:37:22 again and I hit the water
01:37:24 the impact
01:37:26 of this of this impact
01:37:28 now this was a successful flip I did
01:37:30 a successful flip but the cost
01:37:32 the cost of this this is
01:37:34 what's been known to you know that people
01:37:36 in ancient Rome
01:37:38 people in ancient Greece they speculated the source
01:37:40 of thunder they did not know what caused
01:37:42 lightning to happen it was this
01:37:44 it was this is what God was
01:37:46 doing belly flops and this is exactly what happened
01:37:48 to me off the 10 foot fucking
01:37:50 high dive the impact
01:37:52 of this again was reported
01:37:54 to me later to cause every woman
01:37:56 in the vicinity to lose
01:37:58 all chance of giving birth at the sheer
01:38:00 lack of sexuality present
01:38:02 in this environment they're all fertile
01:38:04 they're all infertile forever all
01:38:06 the men all their dicks were treated into
01:38:08 their bodies and the sound of this
01:38:10 happened all the nearby children
01:38:12 and I I I emerged back
01:38:14 to the surface literally unable
01:38:16 to move my arms due to the searing
01:38:18 agony in every part of my fucking
01:38:20 body and if you
01:38:22 look close if you look close
01:38:24 at the image I'm uploading right now
01:38:26 you can see that in fact not a lie this is
01:38:28 100% accurate I am literally
01:38:30 bleeding out of my nose because the
01:38:32 impact on my face and skull
01:38:34 fucked up my neck and
01:38:36 fucked up my face my nose was
01:38:38 actually damaged and it
01:38:40 bled for a good long while after this
01:38:42 everyone
01:38:44 you see the blood there's blood
01:38:46 in that nose yeah you can see that
01:38:48 just a little just a little
01:38:50 blood there just a little
01:38:52 little bit of blood look at the little blood
01:38:54 that's that's all you need
01:38:56 that's all you need and
01:38:58 you know I did it because
01:39:00 I did my fucking flip I did
01:39:02 my flip off the high dive you should
01:39:04 quit while you were ahead the consequences
01:39:06 now I don't know if you can see this you got to raise the contrast
01:39:08 but the red was on my entire
01:39:10 body it had begun to fade at this point
01:39:12 but my whole body
01:39:14 is seething I feel it right now my right
01:39:16 leg is gone
01:39:18 it doesn't exist anymore it was destroyed
01:39:20 by the impact the force was too much
01:39:22 anyway that's it people
01:39:24 I did it I fucking did it but this was
01:39:26 this was the peak moment of pain
01:39:28 probably in the last I don't know
01:39:30 10 years of my life or so well I
01:39:32 was smashing the flesh Nate was
01:39:34 splashing the flesh
01:39:40 oh that's right Ben that's right
01:39:42 and that's why I'm a winner
01:39:44 I didn't give up though
01:39:46 I'm a champ I did it but the cost
01:39:48 will haunt me from never be the same
01:39:50 that's all there is to it well you know I also
01:39:52 have a I also have a story
01:39:54 of great triumphs and great falls
01:39:56 speaking of you know pushing
01:39:58 your body past its physical limits
01:40:00 of being proud of accomplishing something
01:40:02 instead of just being straight which anyone
01:40:04 can do the gays are pretty bad at it
01:40:06 though to be fair I finally
01:40:08 started going to the gym every day
01:40:10 I got a membership I started kicking
01:40:12 my body's ass into shape oh my god
01:40:14 that's great I was I started going there with
01:40:16 one yeah going for a couple months
01:40:18 he looks great he's lost like he's been
01:40:20 going every single night he's lost like 30
01:40:22 pounds fantastic great so
01:40:24 I messaged them I'm like hey one let's go
01:40:26 I'm going to the gym with you today and he's like
01:40:28 hell yeah dude so I fucking
01:40:30 go there you know I'm a guest the first
01:40:32 couple days but I get my membership
01:40:34 I'm hanging out in the massage chairs afterwards
01:40:36 you know and like he's there to like help me
01:40:38 and motivate me it's so fucking easy when
01:40:40 there's like a guy with you like a friend
01:40:42 it's a huge benefit no doubt
01:40:44 you know like I've never like
01:40:46 I've never had the courage to go in
01:40:48 the gym but once I was in there
01:40:50 I was blown away at how fucking easy
01:40:52 it is to work out it is it's just so
01:40:54 boring when it's when you're by yourself
01:40:56 yeah it's a drag so
01:40:58 I've been going there every day and I'm
01:41:00 and I'm you know I'm doing my I got my
01:41:02 fucking my blue raspberry pre-workout
01:41:04 I got my fucking muscle milk

01:41:16 I'm not eating any garbage except
01:41:18 the other day my mom got me a fucking quarter
01:41:20 pounder that I had to eat so she wouldn't feel bad
01:41:22 yep yep but that doesn't count so I
01:41:24 I know the feeling well
01:41:26 that's fantastic once you're the hardest
01:41:28 thing by far is getting the momentum
01:41:30 up once you're in the swing
01:41:32 that's that's the golden zone and I was
01:41:34 I was so I've been so proud
01:41:36 of myself and like like experiencing
01:41:38 legit the first good
01:41:40 mood I've had in like four years
01:41:42 it's a legit mood booster it is working out
01:41:44 and the pride you feel from doing it
01:41:46 I've been working out for maybe two months
01:41:48 now and like and yeah
01:41:50 I definitely just feel like
01:41:52 more positive emotionally
01:41:54 it's great yeah like I like
01:41:56 right after the first day like I
01:41:58 thought that like I'll I'd be
01:42:00 I'm gonna be tired at first and it's gonna like
01:42:02 really make me miserable I'm not gonna want to go
01:42:04 immediately like I just like I look
01:42:06 forward to it every day it's like

01:47:16 migraine from listening to it and finally
01:47:18 like you know we're all like standing

01:48:52 can criticize me you can help me you can give
01:48:54 me all the pointers you want
01:48:56 but this fucking guy does not know me
01:48:58 you know there's a balance
01:49:00 to be found there for sure
01:49:02 I wanted to shove the fucking dumbbell
01:49:04 down his fucking throat because you gotta
01:49:06 establish a rapport with someone before you
01:49:08 yeah do that
01:49:10 to like sit there and try to like to try to
01:49:12 patronize me like I'm being lazy
01:49:14 like you don't know like what it took
01:49:16 for me to even get to this point in my life
01:49:18 when I am here at the gym every
01:49:20 day at all doing as much as I am
01:49:22 this is the most I've ever done I'm fucking
01:49:24 proud of myself don't fucking stand
01:49:26 there and try to take it away from me
01:49:28 you piece of fucking dog shit
01:49:30 asshole cock sucking mother fucking moron
01:49:32 idiot I'm sure he had good intentions
01:49:34 I'm sure I
01:49:36 I don't like
01:49:38 I don't like how he did it I don't like
01:49:40 it either yeah I mean if somebody said that
01:49:42 to me I'd be like what the fuck are you talking about
01:49:44 dude that that kind of shit
01:49:46 guys like that that that is exactly the
01:49:48 reason I didn't go to the gym for
01:49:50 the first 30 years of my life and it's
01:49:52 exactly the reason why millions of people
01:49:54 don't because it's fucking
01:49:56 embarrassing and patronizing and
01:49:58 like mean and shitty
01:50:00 like I get that like you know
01:50:02 one knows the guy so he can you know that's
01:50:04 one thing for one it's motivational
01:50:06 and that's what he said like one's messaging me on the way
01:50:08 home he's like yeah he didn't mean anything he's trying to
01:50:10 motivate you and I'm like I know dude
01:50:12 and it you know but he doesn't know me
01:50:14 and I'm fucking pissed off
01:50:16 and then you know one such a sweetheart
01:50:18 the coolest guy ever my brother
01:50:20 you know one's like you know
01:50:22 well you know I talked to him
01:50:24 and I stood up for you and I
01:50:26 and I told him that and
01:50:28 you know I hope this doesn't stop you from
01:50:30 coming in and I'm like
01:50:32 buddy it won't don't worry I'll be in
01:50:34 there tomorrow same as every day and
01:50:36 then you then I went home and I
01:50:38 watched Detective Pikachu and I cried
01:50:40 because the fucking emotional toll
01:50:42 was so fucking I was
01:50:44 I was feeling really hormonal
01:50:46 because like the combination of my
01:50:48 of my rage
01:50:50 at this guy and like my
01:50:52 love for Juan and his brotherly kindness
01:50:54 standing up for me in the gym
01:50:56 after I left you know I don't know exactly
01:50:58 what he must have said to the guy but I'm assuming
01:51:00 that what he said is that the guy said
01:51:02 hey weird your friend go man
01:51:04 and I'm just assuming that Juan looked at him
01:51:06 and in his best Lars Ulrich
01:51:08 voice said he fucking
01:51:10 left the gym!
01:51:12 hahaha
01:51:14 oh baby there you
01:51:16 go
01:51:18 you know I don't know about you guys I have a lot
01:51:20 of faith look I've been in
01:51:22 decent shape like okay shape
01:51:24 for last several years but this like meme
01:51:26 it's like a stereotype of guys like
01:51:28 getting hot in their 30s getting like
01:51:30 swollen ripped and stuff it fills me
01:51:32 with a lot of confidence that no matter
01:51:34 what I do I will inevitably
01:51:36 be swole in my 30s this
01:51:38 is where my thinking goes I don't
01:51:40 know why but it seems to like happen
01:51:42 it makes sense it makes sense every time I see
01:51:44 a guy in his 40s he's got that like
01:51:46 that weathered like rip
01:51:48 shit body yeah
01:51:50 I believe it I think it's just a natural
01:51:52 thing there's natural progression
01:51:54 you get fucking swole
01:51:56 I knew a girl growing up
01:51:58 I guess I won't say her name but like her dad
01:52:00 was just so fucking
01:52:02 swole it was like insane he's just like some
01:52:04 normal like super nice guy
01:52:06 he was like a leader in our Boy Scout trip
01:52:08 weird how much hotter he was
01:52:10 than like every other person around
01:52:12 what a fucking badass he just did
01:52:14 Bowflex every day I don't
01:52:16 I don't remember who you're talking about
01:52:18 but okay he might have been
01:52:20 he was like a younger guy's dad
01:52:22 so he might have joined like after you left
01:52:24 or something I don't know I don't know
01:52:26 okay whatever whatever should we go to
01:52:28 voicemail yeah I think we're ready
01:52:30 what do you have something
01:52:32 um well I have one quick
01:52:34 story sure feel free
01:52:36 but it's really just like a change
01:52:38 I cut my hair
01:52:40 oh my god how short is it
01:52:42 I have short hair now
01:52:44 do you have pictures
01:52:46 I don't like
01:52:48 showing pictures
01:52:50 okay just give us an idea of how short
01:52:52 well it's not like a buzz cut
01:52:54 it's okay
01:52:56 my I don't know
01:52:58 what like shaving things
01:53:00 are called like are we talking
01:53:02 Ronald Weasley length Harry Potter length
01:53:04 I'm using examples you'll understand
01:53:06 those are like the same length
01:53:08 uh nah
01:53:10 it's like they said it was a number
01:53:12 six something on the razor
01:53:14 okay that's yeah okay that makes sense to me
01:53:16 so
01:53:18 you know it's it's the
01:53:20 strangely doesn't feel that different
01:53:22 I thought it would be like oh my god my head
01:53:24 can move in so many other different directions
01:53:26 it can't it's the same
01:53:28 um some people expecting a big power
01:53:30 upgrade yeah I was expecting
01:53:32 I was expecting like I was like
01:53:34 you know taking off the weights and now suddenly
01:53:36 my neck could go 100 miles an hour
01:53:38 you're like Goku and Krillin taking off the
01:53:40 turtle shells yeah exactly
01:53:42 um
01:53:44 apparently according to
01:53:46 my mom
01:53:48 and also and also some just
01:53:50 random people who were at a party a few days
01:53:52 later I looked younger
01:53:54 and I looked good and dude
01:53:56 I assume
01:53:58 I assume they're telling the truth
01:54:00 we'll tell you the truth
01:54:02 dude we'll fucking roast you
01:54:04 we'll kill you
01:54:06 we will murder you
01:54:08 this is this is why I was like a little hesitant
01:54:10 about like saying yes to posting
01:54:12 the uh the wizard
01:54:14 flying on a broomstick thing because I didn't
01:54:16 wear a hat and you could see
01:54:18 you could see my fucking hairline
01:54:20 I must see
01:54:22 uh
01:54:24 I'll think about it I'll think about it
01:54:26 I don't actually have a picture yet
01:54:28 you're just gonna hide your face until it grows
01:54:30 back and pretend nothing happened
01:54:32 yeah yeah that's that's
01:54:34 that's the plan
01:54:36 any uh any reason for the change in
01:54:38 particular um well
01:54:40 I've been feeling like
01:54:42 I don't do anything
01:54:44 with the fact that my hair is long
01:54:46 like I just have it long because it's been long for
01:54:48 a while and
01:54:50 really it started
01:54:52 at secondary schools like like
01:54:54 almost a decade of having
01:54:56 long curly hair
01:54:58 and I got bullied for it and I guess
01:55:00 in my in my efforts to
01:55:02 like defy bullies
01:55:04 I just didn't do what they wanted me to do
01:55:06 and get normal hair
01:55:08 and so I had weird hair forever
01:55:10 and uh some people like it
01:55:12 but um
01:55:14 I'm tired of not being normal and having
01:55:16 people stare at me all the time
01:55:20 fair enough fair enough
01:55:22 also it's really hot and it's just like
01:55:24 yeah you know I understand now
01:55:26 why it's a good idea to cut it
01:55:28 I bet it looks good
01:55:30 I have I'm optimistic about it
01:55:32 I agree
01:55:34 that's why I want to see it so I can confirm my suspicions
01:55:36 okay
01:55:38 yeah I'll take a picture I'll take a picture
01:55:40 yeah yeah yeah do it

01:56:12 okay uh all right
01:56:14 speak pipe here we go we've got
01:56:16 a voicemail first from rad
01:56:18 lectures
01:56:20 uh okay let's hear what he has go
01:56:22 PCP
01:56:24 uh I was really intrigued
01:56:26 you guys talked about rad con last episode
01:56:28 uh I got pretty hyped
01:56:30 um question was
01:56:32 about lectures and basically
01:56:34 every single one of you provided some
01:56:36 sort of idea for what you want to do
01:56:38 besides one person
01:56:40 uh Nate you completely dodged
01:56:42 the fucking question
01:56:44 but a bigger question for you guys
01:56:46 as creators as a whole
01:56:48 do you like to hype up
01:56:50 the creation
01:56:52 of a video
01:56:54 or piece of work that you guys do
01:56:56 or do you like to keep things
01:56:58 secret because I sort of
01:57:00 get that vibe more from
01:57:02 Nate more than anyone here just because
01:57:04 of that last question
01:57:08 I do not like to hype stuff up
01:57:10 ahead of time but if I have
01:57:12 an opportunity to do so I
01:57:14 will sometimes do it
01:57:16 because I think it's a good idea
01:57:18 even though I don't like to do it
01:57:20 it's not it's not fun
01:57:22 I enjoy
01:57:24 um the feeling of having
01:57:26 a hype thing that I could tell
01:57:28 people and I like keeping it
01:57:30 special for the people
01:57:32 who are like cool like if I
01:57:34 if I meet like um
01:57:36 like lemon tart I met in London
01:57:38 he was he was a cool guy and I like him
01:57:40 and you know he showed me around
01:57:42 Madrid and so he was asking me
01:57:44 about stuff and so I told
01:57:46 him a few plans I had and they
01:57:48 weren't like fully formed yet but it was
01:57:50 just sort of like you know
01:57:52 he's he's really nice and he's
01:57:54 in person I think this is a good time
01:57:56 to like to allow that like it
01:57:58 seems strange to do it
01:58:00 online because
01:58:02 um people bullshitting
01:58:04 online it yeah much more
01:58:06 like like nobody knows
01:58:08 what they want and when you show them
01:58:10 the coolest thing ever then they're
01:58:12 just just good it's just good to keep it
01:58:14 under wraps until there's something
01:58:16 substantial but in person
01:58:18 I feel like if it can make for good
01:58:20 conversation then I'll I'll hype someone up
01:58:22 that's fair it's it's
01:58:24 you talked about this too
01:58:26 uh speaking of hype I guess
01:58:28 I was thinking about whether I should
01:58:30 do this but I do need
01:58:32 to hype this up and I I think
01:58:34 okay I can't 100% guarantee
01:58:36 this but I am almost ready
01:58:38 and I think that maybe
01:58:40 a week from when you are listening
01:58:42 to this podcast the Vapors
01:58:44 Kickstarter 2
01:58:46 may be live so
01:58:48 a week from right now
01:58:50 you might hear me saying hey
01:58:52 go to Kickstarter right now link in the description
01:58:54 the Kickstarter is a go because we are
01:58:56 I am I like I said
01:58:58 I yeah that that
01:59:00 John Cleese lecture I watch that because
01:59:02 I was like I need to get my shit together
01:59:04 and I watch that and I was like I feel better
01:59:06 now and now I understand what I have to do a little better
01:59:08 and I've been doing it and I have written
01:59:10 four out of the six
01:59:12 scripts that I needed to do
01:59:14 for the for the guest strips so we are
01:59:16 almost ready and possibly next week
01:59:18 the Kickstarter will be launching
01:59:20 yeah so the hi I
01:59:22 don't really
01:59:24 I don't really like doing hype even though
01:59:26 it's a good idea like it's a good idea
01:59:28 to hype up a thing before you do it
01:59:30 yeah I like just
01:59:32 putting something out there and having people
01:59:34 see it that that's the
01:59:36 good that's the fun part not the hyping
01:59:38 is the is the reaction to the thing
01:59:40 I think the the best
01:59:42 way to go about it is to hype
01:59:44 vaguely so like
01:59:46 I'm gonna do a thing on this date is like
01:59:48 what what what things are you gonna do and that makes
01:59:50 that builds that builds hype
01:59:52 for people to be
01:59:54 anticipating something
01:59:56 but they don't like have an idea
01:59:58 of what they should be expecting necessarily
02:00:00 I mean you know if you make
02:00:02 want if you make videos or comics
02:00:04 or whatever they're gonna be assuming
02:00:06 it's one of those
02:00:08 but they you know the the Vega
02:00:10 you keep it it feels like a lot of
02:00:12 brands are doing this as well
02:00:14 and movie trailers as well
02:00:16 the very
02:00:18 maybe not movie trailers I don't keep up
02:00:20 those trailers that are just there are just
02:00:22 for example just a logo like bayonetta 3
02:00:24 yeah we saw and and and
02:00:26 Star Wars is like there's nothing in the
02:00:28 trailer like I've seen it I was like
02:00:30 well cool I guess
02:00:32 nothing there's nothing there
02:00:34 maybe there's nothing in the movie
02:00:36 but it's still it still builds
02:00:38 hype just as effectively because people are being
02:00:40 reminded that a thing is about to come out
02:00:42 and when it comes out they will be
02:00:44 ready and willing and able to listen
02:00:46 and watch rather than if you
02:00:48 just posted it people
02:00:50 might not like catch on
02:00:52 because there was no nothing you know to
02:00:54 to remind them to pay attention
02:00:56 that's true
02:00:58 you know
02:01:00 on the subject here I mean first of all
02:01:02 the person astutely noted I did not
02:01:04 comment on my thing that that is in fact
02:01:06 deliberate because I didn't want
02:01:08 I mean whatever like I just
02:01:10 as exactly as you said I like to keep
02:01:12 things secretive and I'll tell you
02:01:14 there's multiple reasons why one is because
02:01:16 I find the hype cycle
02:01:18 both kind of counterproductive
02:01:20 I mean in this way of like tell like look at the ghost in the shell
02:01:22 thing when it's kind of counterproductive
02:01:24 and like it
02:01:26 can it put and the other things it puts
02:01:28 expectations
02:01:30 on things that I think are not actually helpful
02:01:32 and I almost think it's
02:01:34 almost kind of immoral
02:01:36 in a sense to like
02:01:38 like what if you fail then it's like
02:01:40 you've kind of disappointed
02:01:42 everyone and like they were wrong
02:01:44 to it's almost like you lied
02:01:46 if you have promised something then you don't deliver
02:01:48 what people expect I don't know that one's a little more bullshit
02:01:50 yeah I very much
02:01:52 I very much dislike the
02:01:54 stress of promising anything
02:01:56 like once I
02:01:58 once I like let it known
02:02:00 that I'm going to do something then it becomes
02:02:02 an obligation and I don't want to do it
02:02:04 yes that's a big part of it too
02:02:06 whereas when I can drop something I just prefer
02:02:08 to surprise people yeah that's all positive
02:02:10 there's no expectation and it feels good
02:02:12 and I think everyone's kind of better off that way
02:02:14 but I will be super clear on another
02:02:16 reason why I do it
02:02:18 another reason why I hate to announce project is
02:02:20 in case
02:02:22 they fall through or I fail
02:02:24 or it isn't as good
02:02:26 as like I might have
02:02:28 hyped it up to be things of that nature
02:02:30 I do not want to be
02:02:32 the guy who fails to live up to
02:02:34 expectations I want to be the guy
02:02:36 who provided something even if it's only
02:02:38 mildly entertaining because it's
02:02:40 a lot better than failing people's
02:02:42 expectations in my in my opinion
02:02:44 on the other hand hyping
02:02:46 a thing up it it it affects
02:02:48 me like part of
02:02:50 like saying that I'm
02:02:52 going to be launching the Kickstarter
02:02:54 next week makes it a lot more likely
02:02:56 that I will actually do it
02:02:58 that's definitely true that all right
02:03:00 that's a thing but like
02:03:02 I mean assume
02:03:04 not as much about it is like
02:03:06 a creative process it's mostly just like to
02:03:08 actually create the Kickstarter and do all the
02:03:10 busy work well it's half and half because I
02:03:12 have to write the scripts but right
02:03:14 but like I feel
02:03:16 like a hyping up something that you have
02:03:18 to be creative for
02:03:20 is a little more like
02:03:22 nuanced and how
02:03:24 like variable and how well it works
02:03:26 because you might just lose
02:03:28 like your focus or like you won't
02:03:30 have an idea or you won't be able to think
02:03:32 of something creative enough if you still have
02:03:34 to do like all the creative work
02:03:36 before the thing is realized and like you don't
02:03:38 really know how it's going to turn out
02:03:40 while you're hyping it
02:03:42 but you know on this one thing I am
02:03:44 somewhat assuaged in my fears
02:03:46 by the fact that like
02:03:48 for example when we were planning Radcon 3
02:03:50 like one of my worries was that like we'll
02:03:52 make things that are bad but like
02:03:54 I've really have come to the
02:03:56 conclusion during Radcon 2
02:03:58 2 but like working with you guys on
02:04:00 that content I was worried to be bullshit
02:04:02 but like it just seems to almost
02:04:04 magically happen that we just
02:04:06 make good stuff so like
02:04:08 at this point I feel comfortable saying like
02:04:10 if we did Radcon 4 tomorrow I'd be like
02:04:12 guys give to Radcon 4 I know it will be
02:04:14 good I have all the confidence in the
02:04:16 world we will make things people enjoy
02:04:18 even though I don't know at all what those things
02:04:20 will be we just produce
02:04:22 products that are enjoyable
02:04:24 and that's a pretty powerful
02:04:26 thing that makes me feel good
02:04:28 you gotta believe in the process
02:04:30 at some point at some level you kinda just gotta
02:04:32 have confidence and believe in yourself
02:04:34 and to say and to promise like I'm gonna
02:04:36 make this thing you kinda just have to like
02:04:38 trust that you can do
02:04:40 it and like a lot
02:04:42 of the time just believing that you can
02:04:44 do it will empower
02:04:46 you to do it I feel good
02:04:48 I also have acquired
02:04:50 a sense that like if I sit down
02:04:52 and decide I'm going to make a project I
02:04:54 feel confident that I can
02:04:56 make almost anything I wanna do
02:04:58 good and entertaining and enjoyable
02:05:00 but the issue that I
02:05:02 have with all this is like the logistics
02:05:04 and the time management of making
02:05:06 sure I get to these things and get them done
02:05:08 and like now it's like I gotta
02:05:10 make money while doing it cause it's my job and stuff
02:05:12 like will I be able to
02:05:14 balance all those things?
02:05:16 That for me is the big variable question
02:05:18 cause you know like I wanted to
02:05:20 have like a big video out every month
02:05:22 once I was like pro doing this stuff
02:05:24 but like I've had tough time managing
02:05:26 my time with we Aguas and doing other stuff
02:05:28 it's like I have not done that yet and it's been two months
02:05:30 so like that's that's this is
02:05:32 my big concern with stuff like this
02:05:34 I okay do you guys
02:05:36 remember that idea I had for a lecture
02:05:38 I mentioned it in the chat
02:05:40 do you remember and I'm not sure if I should say it
02:05:42 why don't you type it
02:05:44 we will not say it but if you type it in the chat
02:05:46 I will say it in gross disgusting audio
02:05:48 okay
02:05:50 does that ring a bell
02:05:52 a little bit
02:05:54 oh yeah a little bit
02:05:56 I'm not sure should I say it
02:05:58 I forget what it is
02:06:00 I don't know what that is yeah
02:06:02 but it would
02:06:04 oh
02:06:06 oh that's right
02:06:08 um I mean up to you dog
02:06:10 I don't know I think it's unlikely
02:06:12 you'll actually do it personally but
02:06:14 oh that sounds like a fucking challenge
02:06:16 I don't know I'm not sure if it's
02:06:18 I guess I would have to actually
02:06:20 do some work and start like
02:06:22 taking notes for it and like
02:06:24 figure out whether it would make a good lecture
02:06:26 I agree
02:06:28 but I find it personally compelling
02:06:30 is the uh
02:06:32 alright I'll just say it
02:06:34 I'll say it with the caveat that I
02:06:36 guaranteeing that I will do it but it is on the table
02:06:38 is um
02:06:40 projared and holly conrad
02:06:42 thing their whole affair and whatever
02:06:44 it was predicated
02:06:46 like they
02:06:48 had characters in the same d&d campaign
02:06:50 and like this
02:06:52 their characters in the game
02:06:54 crossed over into real life because
02:06:56 like they like
02:06:58 the dimensional merge is literally real
02:07:00 the dimensional merge took place it started with them
02:07:02 they kicked it all off
02:07:04 Chris didn't know but this is what started it
02:07:06 and because like
02:07:08 Heidi was like texting them and talking
02:07:10 about their characters fucking which leads
02:07:12 to the inevitable conclusion that they were doing
02:07:14 like roleplay fucking in character
02:07:16 as their d&d character and I thought
02:07:18 it would be pretty funny to do a lecture
02:07:20 doing like the history
02:07:22 of their d&d characters
02:07:24 and like like where and all that
02:07:26 and how this whole
02:07:28 like the same way that like the
02:07:30 sonichu lecture is talking about sonichu
02:07:32 and in doing so
02:07:34 you must discuss Chris
02:07:36 this would be an in-character thing about the narrative
02:07:38 of Diath and Strix
02:07:40 and like who they are and what their story is
02:07:42 and you know it would inevitably cross over
02:07:44 into the real life
02:07:46 story and I thought it was a funny idea
02:07:48 it's a funny idea
02:07:50 I'm just curious about it
02:07:52 I think we spoke about this briefly but like
02:07:54 did Jared's recent video where he
02:07:56 made at least a pretty good comeback
02:07:58 many people say it seems
02:08:00 true to me too
02:08:02 no I watch it I was just curious
02:08:04 did that move the dial for you much
02:08:06 I already knew everything
02:08:08 that he said in that video
02:08:10 because like
02:08:12 I'd been following the story and like I talked to
02:08:14 Bedhead Bernie as he was making his
02:08:16 he asked me for like my input on it and stuff
02:08:18 I see
02:08:20 that was all stuff I already knew
02:08:22 and I don't think it exonerates
02:08:24 I don't think Jared is like 100% exonerated
02:08:26 of everything he did like I still think having
02:08:28 like Nude's fan tumbler is gross
02:08:30 but I do think that a lot of the stuff people
02:08:32 were saying about him is like
02:08:34 just like bad faith and wrong
02:08:36 and should be
02:08:38 and should be dismissed
02:08:40 I happen to watch H3's reaction to his new
02:08:42 video I think earlier today and I have not
02:08:44 man that boy was like he had said like
02:08:46 I had already dismissed the things
02:08:48 because there was enough evidence but he was
02:08:50 really mad at him for having this fan
02:08:52 server thing
02:08:54 I will not defend the fan server
02:08:56 I don't well I defended the sense that it's legal
02:08:58 but not in the sense of anything I would ever do
02:09:00 yeah sure it's legal
02:09:02 lots of gross things are legal
02:09:04 that's true that's true
02:09:06 fair enough
02:09:08 but you know what I will say
02:09:10 interestingly enough is that his wife
02:09:12 at the time clearly knew about it
02:09:14 and condoned it
02:09:16 that's absolutely true
02:09:18 let's not forget that if we're taking sides
02:09:20 fair enough
02:09:22 well shit let's go into our next voicemail
02:09:24 let me get it right here
02:09:26 okay this one is from
02:09:28 our boy Mozilla Fennekin
02:09:30 is writing it again now if I remember correctly
02:09:32 did we just send him to jail last
02:09:34 I think we sent him because he was the one you had
02:09:36 the human core guy right
02:09:38 yeah he said that the most human core thing
02:09:40 is having a toilet
02:09:42 factually inactive
02:09:44 I just want to say
02:09:46 completely debunked by the existence of pigs
02:09:48 because pigs like
02:09:50 a known fact about them is they always
02:09:52 shit the furthest away
02:09:54 in a specific place the furthest away from where they sleep
02:09:56 and eat
02:09:58 that's true but we found an article of like animals that do this
02:10:00 animal latrines
02:10:02 animal latrines is like a phenomenon in nature
02:10:04 fucking idiot
02:10:06 a lot of species do it
02:10:08 let's see if he has any defense for himself
02:10:10 okay go
02:10:12 hey guys Mozilla fuckface here
02:10:14 just taking a good shit I got on this litter box
02:10:16 I got for myself in voice jail
02:10:18 you know I gotta say it's actually pretty nice in here
02:10:20 there's literally no security in here whatsoever
02:10:22 so I used my white girl privilege
02:10:24 to ask to speak to the manager
02:10:26 but there was no one around
02:10:28 so I guess that means I'm the
02:10:30 manager now
02:10:32 anyway I've been rethinking this whole human core
02:10:34 thing and I think it's super human core
02:10:36 to be looking at drawings of people
02:10:38 but they're not actually people
02:10:40 and there's so many drawings that it looks
02:10:42 like the not people are moving
02:10:44 it just got me thinking uh what's
02:10:46 your favorite anime hit me back I want
02:10:48 to know more about what human core
02:10:50 really is
02:10:52 he's clearly having too easy
02:10:54 a time in jail we gotta confiscate his
02:10:56 litter box
02:10:58 he's reveling in the attention he gets
02:11:00 from being put in jail
02:11:02 he's not okay
02:11:04 we gotta send like what's the word
02:11:06 isolation tank
02:11:08 is the PCP hail
02:11:10 yeah start the pcb hail in pcb jail
02:11:12 let's see if he can pelt it with
02:11:14 rocks of ice and shit
02:11:16 all right uh moving on
02:11:18 let's go to I don't know
02:11:20 that I even have a favorite anime
02:11:22 um I mean it's I don't know
02:11:24 we're deliberately not answering this question
02:11:26 we're deliberately not I mean you could
02:11:28 but no it's I just maybe think like I don't know
02:11:30 if I even have one I know bakumon
02:11:32 is my favorite manga but I don't know if I have a favorite
02:11:34 anime the thing about this question
02:11:36 is that nobody asks it sincerely
02:11:38 so I'm not gonna give a sincere answer
02:11:40 exactly the right attitude looks like
02:11:42 I fucked up
02:11:44 all right we go to in my PJ's
02:11:46 by the freeway okay go
02:11:48 all right
02:11:50 so real quick wanted to go over
02:11:52 some things that are more human
02:11:54 core than just bathrooms
02:11:56 or something like that yeah
02:11:58 so we've got let's see
02:12:00 there's
02:12:02 sweating sweating to cool down
02:12:04 human started doing it because
02:12:06 they needed
02:12:08 the evaporative cooling properties
02:12:10 because they were endurance renters
02:12:12 uh like they used it for
02:12:14 hunting uh and so the only
02:12:16 other animal that does it uh
02:12:18 that sweats as much as we do to cool down
02:12:20 our horses and uh
02:12:22 really like we could
02:12:24 do it better than them if you if you like
02:12:26 trained to be an endurance runner you could
02:12:28 outrun a horse um yeah wait
02:12:30 what hippos also do it like over
02:12:32 overall like for sunscreen so it's like not
02:12:34 the same thing hippo's horse
02:12:36 humans hmm yeah we also
02:12:38 keep pets which is pretty human core
02:12:40 um nothing else
02:12:42 really keeps pets uh
02:12:44 at least that I know of symbiotic relationships
02:12:46 or a thing but like
02:12:48 there's a type of toad that keeps spiders
02:12:50 as a pet think about it
02:12:52 uh also munchy I'm an RA uh just so you know
02:12:54 um if you want your
02:12:56 RA to hate you just don't be the loud dorm
02:12:58 or the one that smells like weed
02:13:00 uh yeah that's about it
02:13:02 adios
02:13:04 do you say frogs keep spiders as pets
02:13:06 there there's I've seen an image
02:13:08 of a little toad and like it on a blog
02:13:10 a while ago and it was really cute
02:13:12 uh there's either it was a large
02:13:14 toad that kept
02:13:16 like a small tarantula as a pet
02:13:18 that would eat bugs and bring it to him
02:13:20 or it was a large tarantula that kept a tiny
02:13:22 toad as a pet um
02:13:24 I don't know I don't know the situation
02:13:26 but they both eat the same thing
02:13:28 so I suppose there's just sort of like
02:13:30 you know their buddies
02:13:32 like like the tarantula drains the fluids
02:13:34 out of it and then he gives like the husks to the frog
02:13:36 something something of that nature
02:13:38 like they they both hunt the same thing
02:13:40 and like one is fed with the thing
02:13:42 or it might be like the toad utilizes
02:13:44 the spider's web
02:13:46 something strange and funny super cool
02:13:48 uh but the domestication of animals
02:13:50 is pretty human okay I
02:13:52 yeah I feel like there's a lot of misunderstanding to me
02:13:54 okay just something that humans do
02:13:56 is not human core sweating
02:13:58 yeah I know humans sweat and we are
02:14:00 not many other animals sweat like we do
02:14:02 that doesn't that's not human core
02:14:04 human core action is an action
02:14:06 that humans are driven to do
02:14:08 for no other for no
02:14:10 like good purpose
02:14:12 that does not serve any end so like
02:14:14 the domestication of animals I would not say
02:14:16 is strictly human core because animals are domesticated
02:14:18 for like practical purposes
02:14:20 but like keeping like house cats
02:14:22 or something or keeping like keeping
02:14:24 pets just for fun like that's human core
02:14:26 I definitely agree
02:14:28 I definitely agree yeah
02:14:30 is fun is having fun
02:14:32 for fun sake human core
02:14:34 dogs play though
02:14:36 then again we made dogs
02:14:38 by humans so like we shaped them in our image
02:14:40 maybe a little bit you know in our image
02:14:42 yes you guys ever you guys ever just have
02:14:44 a moment where you're like what the fuck
02:14:46 is this podcast that I'm on
02:14:48 um yes because
02:14:50 that's all I feel when I'm hearing
02:14:52 well you know humans are the only
02:14:54 people who sweat but also horses
02:14:56 sweat so I guess it's not totally giving
02:14:58 a lecture on like what animals sweat out of
02:15:00 their buttholes or whatever and I'm just sitting here
02:15:02 like how did I get
02:15:04 we're just doing what screen ranted we have to come
02:15:06 up with catchphrases to engage our audience
02:15:08 and human core is one of them so we've
02:15:10 got to be scattershot and just say shit
02:15:12 like I found it interesting that
02:15:14 hey guys and hippos are all lumped
02:15:16 together in one or else
02:15:18 I'm just being cool
02:15:20 we're the reason people are dying
02:15:22 you know what what was that
02:15:24 cool catchphrase I came up with the other day
02:15:26 I can't quite it was something like
02:15:28 uh having sex
02:15:30 with women and licking pussy
02:15:32 iconic
02:15:34 that sounds right that's my
02:15:36 famous catchphrase
02:15:38 I'm gonna work that into every conversation
02:15:40 this podcast is no overall theme
02:15:42 it's just we've got to touch on we've got to touch
02:15:44 on all the all the big winners hey guys
02:15:46 sorry I'm late I was just
02:15:48 having sex with women
02:15:50 and licking pussy
02:15:52 oh you're always doing it
02:15:54 that's no excuse
02:15:56 alright let's go on to retarded
02:15:58 hermy frog man
02:16:00 okay uh go
02:16:02 wait that guy sounds cool
02:16:04 hey pcp thought I'd provide some intergagement
02:16:06 please yeah last episode you guys
02:16:08 talked about conspiracies and I got a story
02:16:10 for this so I want to say
02:16:12 two to three years ago
02:16:14 when Alex Jones was like more of a
02:16:16 big meme you know there's really
02:16:18 there's really popular clip going around
02:16:20 I noticed as a young lad
02:16:22 back in high school
02:16:24 he said something kind of insane
02:16:26 you know he said
02:16:28 the water is turning the frickin
02:16:30 frogs gay
02:16:32 he thought that was a pretty insane statement
02:16:34 at the time right
02:16:36 you know back in the day
02:16:38 fast forward
02:16:40 a year or two
02:16:42 senior year in high school for me
02:16:44 I take a zoology class
02:16:46 okay
02:16:48 study of animals and stuff
02:16:50 and I gotta say
02:16:52 it's
02:16:54 fucking true
02:16:56 the water is turning the frickin
02:16:58 frogs gay
02:17:00 I don't remember exactly what it is
02:17:02 but we had a guest come into our zoology class
02:17:04 who explained something
02:17:06 about like how chemicals in the water
02:17:08 legitimately turns
02:17:10 frogs into like hermaphrodites
02:17:12 okay this is the worst voicemail I've ever heard
02:17:14 and it was insane it was like the most
02:17:16 insane revelation for me
02:17:18 like last year with me
02:17:20 and my friends we were like
02:17:22 holy shit
02:17:24 this sucks really bad
02:17:26 seriously
02:17:28 that's garbage
02:17:30 we all know
02:17:32 a lot of frogs are naturally hermaphroditic
02:17:34 I mean that's literally the plot of Jurassic Park
02:17:36 it's literally not
02:17:38 the same thing as being gay
02:17:40 so there's no connection here
02:17:42 man
02:17:44 there was so much build up
02:17:46 I knew exactly where this was going
02:17:48 the moment I heard his name
02:17:50 and frankly I'm shocked and appalled
02:17:52 I had suspicions
02:17:54 people put so much
02:17:56 emphasis on stuff that Alex Jones says
02:17:58 like he's so crazy
02:18:00 he's the modern day Nostradamus
02:18:02 people just
02:18:04 you know he clearly has
02:18:06 a sense of humor
02:18:08 he does exaggerate these things
02:18:10 he is on some level being funny
02:18:12 when he says stuff like
02:18:14 the water's turning the frickin frogs gay
02:18:16 he's not a totally sincere
02:18:18 he's just exaggerating for
02:18:20 comedic effect
02:18:22 he's saying that there's bad chemicals
02:18:24 and pollution that are messing up the environment
02:18:26 but he's saying it in a funny way
02:18:28 and everyone takes it completely seriously
02:18:30 because people are literally
02:18:32 much stupider than Alex Jones
02:18:34 this guy could
02:18:36 have done a little bit of research
02:18:38 to find out what he was talking about
02:18:40 but instead
02:18:42 he just says hey guys
02:18:44 remember a guy told me one time
02:18:46 that this thing was sort of
02:18:48 adjacent to true and I can't
02:18:50 elaborate on that at all but isn't that crazy guys
02:18:52 no
02:18:54 it sounds like the problem here
02:18:56 is the conflation between hermaphroditic
02:18:58 and gay
02:19:00 that's a problem
02:19:02 it's just the old plot point
02:19:04 from Jurassic Park where they're like
02:19:06 we had some missing building blocks of the DNA
02:19:08 so we used frog DNA but then Ellie Sadler
02:19:10 was like oh but some of the frogs can turn hermaphroditic
02:19:12 but all the dinosaurs are female
02:19:14 but then some of the life finds a way
02:19:16 he says Jeff Goldblum and then they fucking
02:19:18 the hermaphroditic frog DNA
02:19:20 makes them into penises and they have
02:19:22 dinosaur babies damn it
02:19:24 that's everyone knows that shit
02:19:26 wow that's like
02:19:28 biology 101
02:19:30 okay well whatever
02:19:32 fuck that guy next one
02:19:34 we got Mr. Bones speaking of bone
02:19:36 here's Mr. Bones old friend
02:19:38 okay go
02:19:40 what's up my n words
02:19:42 Mr. Bones here
02:19:44 call me because I wanted to pick your brains
02:19:46 about streaming
02:19:48 we've seen renowned creators like
02:19:50 Demo D star and German
02:19:52 move to twitch and leave their youtube channels
02:19:54 to gather dust
02:19:56 most of you have been involved with streaming to some extent
02:19:58 so I'd just like to know
02:20:00 if you'd ever think of transitioning from your current
02:20:02 style of content to mostly streaming
02:20:04 it is ostensibly
02:20:06 quicker and easier and makes more money
02:20:08 so I can see the appeal
02:20:10 but is it something you do full time
02:20:12 as your main source of content
02:20:14 also on top of that question
02:20:16 I'd like to give you some warm congratulations
02:20:18 on the last episode of the PCP
02:20:20 which managed to not have a 20 minute political
02:20:22 shitfest sandwiched somewhere in the middle
02:20:24 you're welcome Mr. Bones
02:20:26 I'm going to treat my vile layer now
02:20:28 slice and dice brothers
02:20:32 I have
02:20:34 people seem to start people are starting
02:20:36 to notice in the comments finally
02:20:38 that
02:20:40 when Jesse is on the podcast
02:20:42 magically it seems to be much
02:20:44 much better every single time
02:20:46 and that when he's
02:20:48 off the podcast for long stretches of time
02:20:50 everything just slowly
02:20:52 devolves into shit
02:20:54 it's all about you Jesse
02:20:56 these Jesse stands in the comments have got to go
02:20:58 it's all tribalism
02:21:00 yeah
02:21:02 and my tribe needs to win
02:21:04 to the guy's question though
02:21:06 so the thing about
02:21:08 I think about streaming like this
02:21:10 I almost feel like streaming
02:21:12 take H3HB for example
02:21:14 you have to build up a reason
02:21:16 for people to give a shit about you
02:21:18 and that needs to be done with
02:21:20 projects that matter
02:21:22 things you do that influence people
02:21:24 and then you can coast off that
02:21:26 by streaming
02:21:28 I don't think that's necessarily true
02:21:30 I don't know if anyone has just gotten
02:21:32 famous purely through streaming
02:21:34 on Twitch
02:21:36 but nobody's famous
02:21:38 for that initially
02:21:40 are they?
02:21:42 absolutely
02:21:44 Ninja was a big just came out
02:21:46 he was a Fortnite streamer
02:21:48 but there must have been something about Ninja
02:21:50 that made people gravitate to him other than
02:21:52 just the fact that he streamed on Twitch
02:21:54 no that literally is it
02:21:56 there is more
02:21:58 he was a literal competitive
02:22:00 to semi-professional
02:22:02 if you go on Twitch
02:22:04 and you just search for the game that you're interested in
02:22:06 and a guy comes up that's how you
02:22:08 find people on Twitch
02:22:10 YouTube does not have a monopoly on discovering people
02:22:12 though it is easier
02:22:14 well
02:22:16 I follow this guy
02:22:18 T90
02:22:20 who was a Twitch streamer
02:22:22 who does commentary over
02:22:24 people doing
02:22:26 competitive Age of Empires 2
02:22:28 things
02:22:30 unironically incredibly engaging
02:22:32 and I love it
02:22:34 it's my favorite game
02:22:36 but at a super high level
02:22:38 and his streams are good
02:22:40 I don't watch his streams
02:22:42 but he started uploading to YouTube
02:22:44 and now I know him as a YouTuber
02:22:46 where he uploads entire streams
02:22:48 or entire matches
02:22:50 from his streams
02:22:52 you can easily go from one to the other
02:22:54 he didn't do anything before Twitch
02:22:56 there was just a guy who got popular
02:22:58 because he was good at what he did
02:23:00 and he did a game where there was a strong
02:23:02 community
02:23:04 the only reason I'd like
02:23:06 right now
02:23:08 my Twitch is basically like an interaction
02:23:10 vehicle for people who are interested
02:23:12 and then also like an excuse to play some games
02:23:14 and do bantery stuff
02:23:16 so like it's fun but it's not my prime focus
02:23:18 I could theoretically see myself in theory
02:23:20 becoming a full-time streamer
02:23:22 for example if
02:23:24 was gratifying to do
02:23:26 and was creatively
02:23:28 fulfilling in some way
02:23:30 and also made sense financially
02:23:32 if that was the case I'd consider it
02:23:34 but I feel like I'm always going to want to do
02:23:36 like right now I'm doing a lot of
02:23:38 Viagra's
02:23:40 what I want to be doing all day
02:23:42 is editing fancy big videos
02:23:44 that I have a little bit of time for
02:23:46 I'm working on fixing my schedule and stuff
02:23:48 but this is what I passionately want to do
02:23:50 so that's always going to be there
02:23:52 and that's why I fucking quit my computer science job
02:23:54 everybody fucking programming job
02:23:56 like if I'm just going to do a job
02:23:58 that's not like better than that
02:24:00 that's just equally just fill in time
02:24:02 and be in a drag and just got to put in the hours in
02:24:04 like I could just do my much better
02:24:06 paying programming job
02:24:08 so I got to make us you know
02:24:10 I think I started
02:24:12 I see streaming as like
02:24:14 kind of a yeah I wouldn't want to do it
02:24:16 full-time it doesn't seem
02:24:18 it's not very creatively fulfilling
02:24:20 and I kind of just see it as like
02:24:22 a time during the week when I can like
02:24:24 interact with like you know
02:24:26 the people in my discord and stuff
02:24:28 because like I'm in my discord a bit but I'm not like
02:24:30 I'm not like chatting a whole lot in there
02:24:32 just here and there so I feel like that's
02:24:34 my time when like people who want to
02:24:36 you know interact with me
02:24:38 or people who like
02:24:40 you know are in you know
02:24:42 my extended community or whatever
02:24:44 who like maybe just want to like touch
02:24:46 base with all like that like that's the time
02:24:48 when I do that and it makes a bit of
02:24:50 money be just because I think some people like
02:24:52 you know have twitch bits that they
02:24:54 you know certain people prefer different
02:24:56 platforms and some people want to
02:24:58 would rather donate through twitch with bits
02:25:00 or something than they would through I don't know
02:25:02 patreon or kofi or whatever
02:25:04 and you know that's it's you know it's
02:25:06 that's another reason to do it to diversify
02:25:08 your platforms so
02:25:10 I guess my short answer is no
02:25:12 I don't want to do it like I wouldn't
02:25:14 transition and I don't
02:25:16 I don't know if it makes more money
02:25:18 I don't know this Mr. Bones
02:25:20 you know with all due respect
02:25:22 Mr. Bone I don't know if you can say that twitch
02:25:24 just makes more money I mean for some people I'm sure it does
02:25:26 but it's definitely not the case for everybody
02:25:28 that twitch is like a more
02:25:30 lucrative thing
02:25:32 from what I understand to be big
02:25:34 on twitch you need to stream like
02:25:36 every second of every day of your life
02:25:38 yeah so like
02:25:40 the like the workload floor
02:25:42 is incredibly high but at that
02:25:44 floor the pay is a lot better
02:25:46 than youtube so like
02:25:48 most people on twitch
02:25:50 for like I mean they're working the long hours
02:25:52 but they're working like not very hard
02:25:54 like comparatively like
02:25:56 they're not being an editor and a director
02:25:58 and a and a voice over
02:26:00 guy or whatever they're not animating anything
02:26:02 to be in a fucking stream it is it is
02:26:04 pretty exhausting but like
02:26:06 there's the yeah you said obstin obstin
02:26:08 obstincibly and I think that's the word
02:26:10 that's correct it's obstincibly
02:26:12 better money
02:26:14 on youtube
02:26:16 I feel like the workload floor is
02:26:18 much lower
02:26:20 but the
02:26:22 the point of which
02:26:24 you can be successful
02:26:26 by not doing that much work
02:26:28 or like putting in the hours
02:26:30 I'm trying to think of a
02:26:32 like a phrase for this
02:26:34 off the top of my head
02:26:36 like if you get a viral hit or something
02:26:38 I don't know
02:26:40 like I don't know what people
02:26:42 viral on twitch in the same way
02:26:44 not really
02:26:46 they have to be like even ninja
02:26:48 I know was like
02:26:50 streaming for a long time and then
02:26:52 suddenly like like sort of
02:26:54 exponential growth because of
02:26:56 algorithm or whatever it was over there
02:26:58 like you just he was playing the right game
02:27:00 of the right time and
02:27:02 everybody shared him with everybody else
02:27:04 and then you became the biggest thing on twitch
02:27:06 um but
02:27:08 uh
02:27:10 I forgot the point I was making
02:27:12 I'm still with my boy Dr. Disrespect
02:27:14 his production values are insane
02:27:16 I think everything
02:27:18 there's one great streamer it's Dr. Disrespect
02:27:20 he has changed the fucking game I'm so
02:27:22 impressed I don't watch it that often I did
02:27:24 for a little bit I mean I think that you
02:27:26 I think that streaming can be
02:27:28 you know a creative medium
02:27:30 and can be just fulfilling
02:27:32 when Dr. Disrespect works
02:27:34 for I'm sure he works with editors and like people
02:27:36 preparing stuff and they like make a really
02:27:38 cool effect that he will unveil
02:27:40 like at some point like like him I told
02:27:42 the story before about like I was watching he press
02:27:44 the button boom camera transitions
02:27:46 now it's like it's literally him
02:27:48 like standing small he's not he stands
02:27:50 up out of his chair now it's like he's like
02:27:52 shoved into obviously green screen
02:27:54 thing where there's a skyscraper it's him
02:27:56 walking out onto a helipad on top
02:27:58 of a skyscraper in a big city
02:28:00 and he's just like on his headset now you can
02:28:02 see him like small in the corner next was helicopter
02:28:04 with like twitch HQ it's it's like
02:28:06 basically New Los Angeles City
02:28:08 in the fucking background and he's just like
02:28:10 yeah you know just made another million just close the deal
02:28:12 just you know doing some sponsorship gigs
02:28:14 just you know make another billion dollars
02:28:16 on the on the market today that is what is
02:28:18 and then he presses another fucking button
02:28:20 and he goes back to his gamer chair and it's like
02:28:22 I when he's there's a
02:28:24 lot of work involved for sure in
02:28:26 preparing those things
02:28:28 then there's like when he's
02:28:30 on when he's actually streaming wherever he can like
02:28:32 push a button and boom unveils this really cool
02:28:34 thing that he's prepared and then he you know
02:28:36 goes on but the meat and potatoes of
02:28:38 it is him sitting in front of a
02:28:40 camera and pause is standing up occasionally
02:28:42 and just like saying shit being funny
02:28:44 telling jokes and like playing
02:28:46 games for like you know I don't know five
02:28:48 six eight hours a day whatever it is
02:28:50 I don't know a schedule and that
02:28:52 could definitely be taxing and doesn't
02:28:54 really sound that fun I don't know
02:28:56 yeah I don't know
02:28:58 I like me I wouldn't want to you know
02:29:00 you're a full-time streamer you know you're basically
02:29:02 doing what you do at an office job which is sitting
02:29:04 in a chair yeah for you know
02:29:06 doing it seems and like
02:29:08 at least you like you can slack off
02:29:10 you can slack off at an office
02:29:12 if you're like on twitch you have to be
02:29:14 like engaging the entire time
02:29:16 well you don't really have to be engaging the entire
02:29:18 time you know
02:29:20 like people people definitely
02:29:22 put it on in the background
02:29:24 and they're not you know there's no
02:29:26 there's no like
02:29:28 culture of being incensed when somebody
02:29:30 isn't on their A game because everybody
02:29:32 understands that if you if you
02:29:34 you know it's just sort of like a window
02:29:36 like you look over to the window
02:29:38 and there's like a thing there and it's always there
02:29:40 and it's reliable and you like it and you subscribe
02:29:42 and you like and favor it because
02:29:44 you like looking at in that window and if they're not
02:29:46 there for even one second you go
02:29:48 you go crazy but if you look there and they're there
02:29:50 it doesn't really matter how
02:29:52 well they're doing you're just
02:29:54 it's just sort of like a I don't know what it is
02:29:56 oh oh
02:29:58 about about twitch okay
02:30:00 so I think I don't I think maybe
02:30:02 I want to do this after
02:30:04 I think maybe I might
02:30:06 announce my plan to do this
02:30:08 in
02:30:09 sonichu lecture number two sonichu
02:30:11 102 advanced
02:30:12 history is what I'm planning to call it
02:30:14 but like after that like you know
02:30:16 a philosophy tube did his like
02:30:18 reading the entire works of Shakespeare
02:30:20 right for charity I kind
02:30:22 of want to do a charity stream where I read through the entirety
02:30:24 of sonichu
02:30:26 do you think it would take a lot of tape hard
02:30:28 to say it might
02:30:30 be a long time like
02:30:32 it could
02:30:34 I mean some chapters would probably take
02:30:36 several hours
02:30:38 as if I'm not like blasting through I might
02:30:40 take like 10 15 20 I don't
02:30:42 I don't know that would take that long but I could see
02:30:44 it taking like a huge a long time
02:30:46 I don't but I want to do a charity
02:30:48 stream first but I don't know what charity
02:30:50 I would do it for I would
02:30:52 we would want to be something funny
02:30:54 patreon.com
02:30:56 all good ideas
02:30:58 I'm sure you could find one
02:31:00 and you know in the time to
02:31:02 not autism speaks because everyone says that's a bad charity
02:31:04 lol okay fair enough
02:31:06 fair enough
02:31:08 I don't know dog
02:31:10 just
02:31:12 I like the idea yeah that's
02:31:14 something I want to do
02:31:16 and that is a twitch a twitch plan
02:31:18 yeah that's kind of what I want
02:31:20 like I know inevitably I will
02:31:22 do another nuzlocke and people are going
02:31:24 bananas they want another nuzlocke
02:31:26 I mean the last one was a triumph
02:31:28 it was a success I like by far my most
02:31:30 lucrative streams as well because people want to be
02:31:32 those Pokemon so like
02:31:34 it's definitely what I will do eventually
02:31:36 I just gotta just gotta carve out some time lads
02:31:38 because that last one really ate into
02:31:40 my schedule of like we Aga was
02:31:42 and other stuff yeah
02:31:44 did a lot of work behind the scenes
02:31:46 yeah they did they did it was good
02:31:48 time and I had a lot of fun like preparing
02:31:50 like the god fight against you know Ben saint
02:31:52 himself or the saint as it was
02:31:54 known as yeah it was dope it was
02:31:56 really sick and the graveyard little skits
02:31:58 we did the music I prepared
02:32:00 lots of fun there's totally fun things and
02:32:02 creative stuff you can do yeah
02:32:04 yeah I like I like twitch
02:32:06 I think it's cool I don't want
02:32:08 I don't want to be a full-time streamer but I
02:32:10 like I like I like
02:32:12 using it occasionally just to
