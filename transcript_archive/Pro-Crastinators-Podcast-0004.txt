00:00:00 Hello and welcome to episode 4 of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:04 Happy to have you back with us again this week, and we are here once again to talk about something.
00:00:09 My name is Guy, the best guy ever, and I'm here with my panel of esteemed internet personalities.
00:00:15 Digi, who are you?
00:00:16 I'm Digibro. I wear sunglasses at night.
00:00:20 Jesse Wood, who are you?
00:00:22 I'm Endless Jess. There's a horse in my house.
00:00:26 Hippocrit.
00:00:28 I'm Hippocrit, and I make videos. No, I don't.
00:00:33 You do sometimes. I've seen them at Ben.
00:00:36 Ben?
00:00:37 Patreon.com slash Ben Saint.
00:00:40 SaintComics.com.
00:00:42 Yes.
00:00:43 I'm really hungover.
00:00:44 He makes comics. Well, good man.
00:00:46 Okay, now, moving on.
00:00:48 Today, we are talking about a topic that's near and dear to my heart.
00:00:53 So, what we're discussing this week is when you're in the bathroom and you're taking a piss,
00:00:59 it is completely appropriate to pull your pants down all the way exposing your ass to ease the stream of urine from your dick.
00:01:05 Well, I just sit down.
00:01:06 That's what we're going into.
00:01:07 Whoa, does that happen?
00:01:08 That's wrong.
00:01:09 That's wrong.
00:01:10 That's wrong.
00:01:11 But I wanted to talk about that.
00:01:13 Okay, we'll save that for next week.
00:01:14 What we're actually talking about this week is too deep for you.
00:01:18 The concept of things being too deep for you, what it means, how it relates to art appreciation, how it relates to pretentiousness, all that shit.
00:01:27 And so, to start us off, I'm going to do what's becoming a tradition and read the Know Your Meme definition off it.
00:01:35 Oh, wait, no, no.
00:01:36 The Urban Dictionary definition.
00:01:37 Oh, fuck.
00:01:38 I didn't have that one open.
00:01:40 Three deep five me dogs.
00:01:42 That's right.
00:01:43 Okay.
00:01:44 So this is a timely topic because I think that everything is too deep for me.
00:01:50 Interesting.
00:01:51 Okay.
00:01:52 So, we really need to figure this out.
00:01:54 This is a big problem.
00:01:56 This is actually something that comes up with me a lot, but we'll talk about this later.
00:02:00 Okay, so here.
00:02:01 If you got the green on you before listening to this podcast, you should get two dank 420 you.
00:02:07 Yes.
00:02:08 No, I'm saying.
00:02:09 I do know what you're saying, dog.
00:02:10 Okay.
00:02:11 All right.
00:02:12 Urban Dictionary definition of too deep for you.
00:02:14 Okay.
00:02:15 When someone or something's artistic value goes beyond a person's perception, leaving that person lost and confused.
00:02:21 And then on the flip side, this may be used to sound like a total douche-tard because you think you're better than everyone else, often used by hipsters.
00:02:30 I mean, it's been a long time since I've heard douche-tard.
00:02:33 Yeah, me too.
00:02:34 When you say something is too deep for you, you don't actually mean that it's too deep.
00:02:39 You're saying it ironically to say that the thing thinks that it's deep.
00:02:43 Well, that is the ironic usage of the term.
00:02:45 It's a dismissive thing.
00:02:46 Yeah.
00:02:47 I've seen it in both ways, though.
00:02:48 Usually in lobby that fans of something.
00:02:50 Unfortunately, there's like half and half between people who are mocking the work by saying it's too deep for you and people who are mocking people who don't understand it by saying it's too deep for you.
00:03:00 But either way, I don't think it's usually that they actually think the work is too deep.
00:03:06 Right.
00:03:07 Okay.
00:03:08 You know, even taking a step back from that, let's talk about what it even means to be too deep for someone.
00:03:14 What is depth of art and what is the correct versus wrong way to perceive something?
00:03:20 Like Eva, right?
00:03:22 Eva is the big anime thing people always bring up is being too deep for you.
00:03:25 Eva.
00:03:26 Yeah.
00:03:27 Evan Gellion.
00:03:28 What the fuck is Eva?
00:03:30 I don't know.
00:03:31 I guess I called Eva so far.
00:03:32 I get shit constantly for saying Evan Gellion, but I haven't heard Eva yet.
00:03:36 Evan Gellion, the correct way to pronounce it.
00:03:38 In Ebon...
00:03:39 Ebon Gellion.
00:03:40 Oh, no one fucking says that shit.
00:03:41 That's gook shit.
00:03:42 Alright, let's...
00:03:43 In Fully Coolie, Meltos says that his dad wrote a whole book on the deep mysteries of Eva.
00:03:49 And that is one of the best dubs of all time.
00:03:52 And I trust their judgment.
00:03:53 There's also a dub for the actual show in which they also say Evan Gellion.
00:03:59 They say Eva, they say Evan Gellion throughout the whole series.
00:04:04 But in the movie, they say Eva for some reason.
00:04:07 And then in the rebuilds, they go back to Eva.
00:04:10 Uh, I don't know.
00:04:12 Anyway, the point is...
00:04:13 I just explained it to you, you dumb shit.
00:04:15 Gibbs Wright, who cares?
00:04:16 The point is, why is that show called Too Deep for You?
00:04:19 It's got a lot of symbolism, right?
00:04:21 And we can talk about what Anno himself says about the show.
00:04:24 But it's got all this symbolism.
00:04:26 It's got all this weird imagery where it's that thing where you really have no idea what's going on.
00:04:31 It's the episode where Shinji gets trapped in that two-dimensional angel or whatever.
00:04:35 And has this whole big crisis of what the fuck's going on.
00:04:38 Nobody even knows.
00:04:39 And, you know, how do you properly appreciate something like that?
00:04:44 Is it an issue of...
00:04:45 I think the reason things like Eva are considered too deep is because some people see it and it's weird.
00:04:54 But they say that they get it, whether they do or not is irrelevant.
00:04:57 The fact that they say they understand it.
00:04:59 And then a lot of other people say, I didn't get it.
00:05:01 This thing's too deep.
00:05:03 You know, it just starts that sort of conversation.
00:05:06 If it was just weird and nobody got it, nobody would say it's too deep.
00:05:10 They just say it was weird, I think.
00:05:12 That's true.
00:05:13 And Anno's been on record as saying all the Christian symbology he just put in there because he thought it looked cool.
00:05:20 So all that stuff, people...
00:05:22 I feel like a lot of people roll that into their understanding of the work and what it means.
00:05:26 I don't think the symbolism is what gives Eva depth.
00:05:30 I think it has played a depth.
00:05:32 People drop that fucking quote out to try and dismiss Eva as not deep.
00:05:38 Because, oh, Anno said that the religious community doesn't mean anything, so it's not deep.
00:05:43 But that's not even the fucking point of what makes it deep in the first place.
00:05:47 And everyone who says that it's not deep, I will take every goddamn one of you.
00:05:51 I'll remove your fucking skin from your bones.
00:05:54 I will put your skin on my dick like a condom and rape your mother.
00:05:59 I couldn't agree with you more.
00:06:00 Fuckers.
00:06:01 I couldn't agree with you more.
00:06:02 Because, you know, whereas Eva is a show that sometimes, I guess, suffers, maybe is not the right word,
00:06:07 but gets a slightly worse rap because it has something like that Christian symbolism
00:06:12 that ultimately doesn't really mean as much as you might think it would by watching it,
00:06:16 that there's something on the other side, like High School of the Dead,
00:06:20 that I think is a fantastic story and has fantastic character developments.
00:06:24 It gets shit on for the opposite reason, because it just shoves tits in your face the whole time.
00:06:28 But I would argue that that only makes the show stronger for what it was going for
00:06:32 and in no way detracts from the depth of the narrative and the characterization.
00:06:36 I think what comes down to is that the depth of the piece of media or art in question
00:06:42 is irrelevant compared to the fact that people are shallow.
00:06:47 And people like to say that they understand things sometimes
00:06:50 when they themselves are kind of concocting this meaning in their own heads.
00:06:55 Well, I think all meaning is, like, partially concocted in your own heads.
00:07:00 Oh, totally.
00:07:01 Like, there's no objective, like, deepness to anything.
00:07:04 It's just what you can take out of it.
00:07:06 Yeah.
00:07:07 I want to cut to the heart here of, like, why this whole concept bothers me.
00:07:13 This too deep for you, right?
00:07:15 Because on the one hand, I do think that a work can legitimately be too deep for you.
00:07:22 I don't think that that makes you wrong or makes the work wrong.
00:07:26 It just means that it's too deep for you to comprehend.
00:07:29 Could you?
00:07:30 Yeah, yeah.
00:07:31 Or even maybe deep isn't the right word.
00:07:34 Maybe it's just that it's too specific for you to understand.
00:07:39 Like, if I were to write a story that was full of references to my own life
00:07:44 that don't make sense to anyone else, and then I posted it up and no one understood it,
00:07:48 then, like, it would be too deep for you.
00:07:52 But that depth has no meaning to you, so it doesn't matter for you that it's too deep for you.
00:07:57 Right, and I feel like that's a lot of what comes up in, like, deep stories.
00:08:00 Because, like, ultimately, things that are deep, I feel like a lot of the time
00:08:04 what people are saying when they call it deep is, like, everything has the same underlying,
00:08:08 human experience, right, is ultimately at the root of pretty much every story ever told.
00:08:12 And it's the way that that's masked or the way that that's communicated.
00:08:16 That's where the complexity and, I guess, the depth comes in.
00:08:19 You can watch the asterisk war sucks part four.
00:08:21 Winning depths about that concept.
00:08:23 But yeah, but what bothers me about this so much with the too deep for you thing
00:08:27 where people are, like, derisive of stuff for acting deep or whatever,
00:08:32 I'm gonna pause at a question.
00:08:34 If Evangelion isn't deep, or whatever other show you think isn't deep
00:08:39 or is pretending to be deep or is pretentious, if that show's not deep, what show is deep?
00:08:44 That's a good question.
00:08:45 Can we ask this? What is actually deep?
00:08:48 Can we each go around and say something that we think is deep?
00:08:51 I think that doesn't be a good exercise.
00:08:53 I think Ava is extremely deep.
00:08:55 Like, I think if we're talking about the complexity of the narrative,
00:08:59 the amount of, like, different things that everything means in the show,
00:09:04 like where, like, the number of meanings that each moment or action has
00:09:09 or that each character has, I think it goes about as deep as any anime has ever gone, for sure.
00:09:16 And also as deep as, like, most literature.
00:09:19 Like, what books are everyone reading that are so fucking deep,
00:09:23 unless it's fucking Ulysses, that Ava is just too deep for you, dog?
00:09:28 Right, right.
00:09:29 Like, what is it? Where's this deep media that's supposedly out there?
00:09:32 You know, I wish I had concocted a list of, like, things that popular media
00:09:35 or, like, the popular culture says is deep, just to go into it.
00:09:39 It's not there, though.
00:09:40 Because public perception is what, yeah, right, it's all, it's all a fugazi.
00:09:44 I mean, I think, go on, Hippo.
00:09:47 Well, I was gonna say, a lot of the time, like, things that are considered deep
00:09:51 are often also considered pretentious.
00:09:53 Right, right.
00:09:54 So if you've got a list of, like, the most pretentious stuff
00:09:57 made by a dumbass, then you'd get all the deep shit.
00:10:01 If something is deep, but you don't understand the depth, then you have two choices.
00:10:06 You can admit that you are not smart enough or knowledgeable enough or whatever
00:10:12 to grasp the depth, or you can deny that it's depth, that the thing is deep,
00:10:17 and say that it's just fake deep, and call it, oh, it's just pretending, it's pretentious.
00:10:22 And say that's the root of it, podcast solved.
00:10:25 Yeah.
00:10:26 Well, on the other hand, though, I don't think that I don't believe in pretentiousness in media.
00:10:33 Of course, of course.
00:10:34 Like, because this argument does come up a lot where people say, like, how can a show be pretentious?
00:10:38 And I'm like, well, I do think that you can approach something with the mindset of,
00:10:43 I'm gonna make this as deep as possible, and then, like, go out of your way to load it
00:10:48 with as much symbolism and as much shit as you want.
00:10:51 And I don't know if I'd say that it absolutely isn't deep, but it's pretending to be, you know?
00:10:59 But I feel like you can kind of know it when you see it.
00:11:03 When you see something that's really putting on airs.
00:11:06 Well, I think we know it when we see it.
00:11:08 Because we're smart.
00:11:09 Everyone else is wrong all the time.
00:11:10 That's true.
00:11:11 Wait, Ben, I'm with you on this.
00:11:13 I think Bioshock Infinite is a good example of being pretentious like that.
00:11:16 Because it's got all these, like, like Matthew Matosis lays out.
00:11:19 I'm pretty much just gonna be paraphrasing him.
00:11:21 But, like, it presents all these things about racism and whatever, and time travel and whatever.
00:11:27 But it doesn't say anything about them.
00:11:29 It just, like, puts them out there and, like, uses them as elements in the story.
00:11:33 And everyone said, oh, advanced storytelling or whatever.
00:11:36 Like, something like, even something I watched just two days ago, I forget what,
00:11:40 erased this new anime this season, I think it does more interesting things with time travel already.
00:11:45 In that it really does...
00:11:47 I think the race is pretentious as fuck.
00:11:50 But we can talk about that on tomorrow's podcast.
00:11:53 Yeah, we'll do that tomorrow.
00:11:54 But, like, the way it's using it, whether you think it's succeeded or not,
00:11:58 to me it seems like it's using it as a conduit to tell the story
00:12:01 and has real ramifications on the characters.
00:12:04 And it's going to explore the way that they're reacting to it
00:12:07 and, like, exploring the choices they made in their life.
00:12:09 And, you know, that's the vehicle to do that with.
00:12:11 And I think it's effective, but, you know, that's to be...
00:12:13 I think that Bioshock Infinite is a pretty good thing to bring up
00:12:17 because it's very easy for us to say that we've seen these themes done better elsewhere
00:12:23 and this is not as deep as it's pretending to be or presenting itself as.
00:12:27 But I know people who are, like, more casual gamers who played Bioshock Infinite.
00:12:34 And when you first go to the city of Bioshock Infinite,
00:12:38 when the game starts and you see the city laid out before you
00:12:41 and it's all beautiful and amazing,
00:12:43 that alone is deep and that alone gives the game its artistic merit, regardless of...
00:12:48 I don't know.
00:12:49 Can art...
00:12:51 I wouldn't say it's deep.
00:12:53 I would say it's impressive visuals are not deep in and of itself.
00:12:56 Even though I might not be impressed with the narrative of Bioshock Infinite,
00:13:00 to the many people, I'm sure, who are impressed by it,
00:13:04 who am I to say that they are not valid.
00:13:07 That's a great point because I have heard so many times people I've talked to
00:13:10 say that they absolutely love Bioshock Infinite.
00:13:13 And I, myself, liked it.
00:13:15 And the more I thought about it, the more I liked it less and less.
00:13:18 I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that I had read Homestuck beforehand.
00:13:23 And because I understood everything,
00:13:25 I wasn't nearly as blown away by the things in the story
00:13:28 and could focus more on the things that really didn't impress me.
00:13:31 Well, let me talk about a thing that's funny about media.
00:13:36 If someone just drew a picture of that city,
00:13:42 there was no game, there was no anything, there was just a picture someone drew,
00:13:46 and it was as good as how the city looks in the game,
00:13:50 you'd probably be like, that's an 8 out of 10 drawing, that's great.
00:13:54 But then in the context of the game, you end up liking it less
00:13:57 because of the other things that are related to it.
00:13:59 But I do agree with Jesse that I think that that image of that city alone,
00:14:04 just walking out and seeing it does speak to the human experience,
00:14:09 because there's a reason, there's a mental reason
00:14:13 that has to do with where you are in society and everything,
00:14:17 that you would see that city and think that about it.
00:14:20 That it would take your breath away means that it captures some kind of
00:14:23 very deep-seated human emotion.
00:14:26 But when you then walk through that city,
00:14:31 and it's just one long hallway until you get to a scripted sequence,
00:14:35 then it becomes a different thing.
00:14:38 Where even though as great as the art design is,
00:14:41 and as much as that by itself would be a 10 out of 10,
00:14:44 then to walk down what is a badly designed game,
00:14:48 and then to come at it from the perspective of someone who cares about game design,
00:14:52 then you're like, okay, well this is a 1 out of 10 game now.
00:14:55 And then you put the 10 out of 10 together,
00:14:58 and you get this 5 that suddenly you're really sour towards.
00:15:04 But I do think that, I think pretentiousness in cases like this
00:15:09 is really in the eye of the beholder, because we can't really say,
00:15:14 A, we can't say what the creator wanted out of it,
00:15:17 like maybe in their minds, rather the people who made the game,
00:15:22 they weren't making something that special,
00:15:25 it was just a game they worked on out of their huge illustrious career.
00:15:30 They had a bunch of cool ideas that they threw together,
00:15:32 it didn't necessarily come together perfectly,
00:15:35 but they got all the ideas they wanted to share out there.
00:15:37 But see, what makes it pretentious to me are the attempts to do one thing,
00:15:41 and like the putting on airs that you've achieved that goal,
00:15:46 and then when you have failed in many other ways.
00:15:48 Like for example, why the fuck is the mom like a ghost?
00:15:53 Because she's dead in this world and alive in another.
00:15:56 Isn't that true of literally everyone in the multiverse?
00:15:59 And like, why can Elizabeth only do these tiny little summoning things
00:16:03 in these certain places when she has literally infinite control over the universe?
00:16:07 I forgot about ghost mom, that's horrible.
00:16:09 What you're talking about Nate is just plot holes.
00:16:13 No, I think they're more than plot holes,
00:16:15 I think these are specific misunderstandings of the mechanics of their own games.
00:16:19 Those things necessarily imply if something's not deep though.
00:16:23 Right, those are failures.
00:16:25 It shows me there's a misunderstanding of what they're trying to communicate,
00:16:28 and that severely hampers my enjoyment.
00:16:31 I don't think it becomes pretentious until it's literally saying this is deep,
00:16:37 and then that if there was a guy, if fucking Ken Levine or whoever came on,
00:16:42 that's who made it, right?
00:16:43 If Ken Levine came on screen afterwards and was like,
00:16:45 did you enjoy my masterpiece, you know?
00:16:48 But I'm saying it feels wrong because he says it's a masterpiece
00:16:52 and yet I see all these issues with it.
00:16:54 But he doesn't say it's a masterpiece.
00:16:55 If it was a 10 out of 10 perfect, if it was great,
00:16:57 well okay, if he doesn't say it's a masterpiece,
00:16:59 I'm judging it by playing the game, and the game feels,
00:17:01 I mean that's what pretentiousness is.
00:17:03 It feels like it's better than it is.
00:17:06 I don't think by playing the game you can only know how the game turned out,
00:17:11 but you can't know what their mindset was making it.
00:17:13 I'm not judging them, I'm judging the piece of art,
00:17:16 and the piece of art feels pretentious.
00:17:18 But how can you say that pretentious without knowing the mindset behind it?
00:17:22 Pretentious is, I'm saying pretentious is now an emotion that you feel.
00:17:27 It's not a property that the game has or that the developer has,
00:17:30 it's something that you feel the game is.
00:17:32 I think it's similar to good or bad game.
00:17:35 Like yes, you have to interpret it and decide how it makes you feel,
00:17:38 whether it's pretentious or not,
00:17:39 but I do think there are some standards that pretty much most people can agree on.
00:17:42 I don't agree. I don't agree.
00:17:44 I don't think that whether something is pretentious or not can come.
00:17:49 I think when you say something's pretentious,
00:17:51 you're saying something about the work and about the person that made it.
00:17:54 Yeah, I think that's why the word pretentious itself is dangerous,
00:17:58 because it's literally saying that it's pretending,
00:18:01 it's implying action on their part.
00:18:04 I don't understand, you guys really don't think that the work by itself
00:18:07 implies that you think it has to involve the creator directly?
00:18:10 I don't think you can say...
00:18:12 I don't know, maybe you can imagine some scenario.
00:18:15 I'm not saying that it's necessarily untrue that the work thinks
00:18:19 or that the creators think that it's better than it is,
00:18:22 but I don't think that you can make that assumption about it.
00:18:26 I think it could just as easily have been
00:18:28 that they had a lot of good ideas and a lot of bad ideas
00:18:32 and putting them next to each other made it look like they thought it was amazing.
00:18:37 It's kind of like if I made a video where I make some incredible point
00:18:45 at one point in the video and then at some other point,
00:18:48 I make a terrible point that kind of shits on the other one,
00:18:51 and it sounds like I'm trying to make myself sound really smart,
00:18:54 but I don't know what I'm talking about,
00:18:56 when it could just as easily be true that I just threw out all the ideas I had
00:19:02 and I knew some were good, I knew some were bad,
00:19:04 and I just threw them all out there.
00:19:06 To me, it seems like if you had something like, let's say,
00:19:09 like Romeo and Juliet, to me, is pretentious only in a certain sense,
00:19:14 that it acts like at the end.
00:19:17 There's a big monologue about how the star-crossed lovers,
00:19:20 there's nothing that could have been done,
00:19:22 and yet the events of the story are these really hammy,
00:19:25 like, oh, he woke up, killed himself, oh, she woke up, killed herself.
00:19:28 It's anime coincidences are what drive the plot of Romeo and Juliet
00:19:33 in the latter portion.
00:19:35 Well, yeah, that's why they were star-crossed,
00:19:37 because fate conspired to cause their downfall.
00:19:40 Okay, but I don't believe in fate, so I guess that story just doesn't appeal to me.
00:19:43 But when you see something like that,
00:19:45 if someone tells a big romantic story,
00:19:47 and let's just say at the end they do a thing like,
00:19:50 oh, and love, this was the greatest,
00:19:53 they do a big, small-ending, celebrating itself.
00:19:57 I was about to bring up interest-seller.
00:19:59 Interstellar is a great example.
00:20:01 I haven't actually seen it, but I know it has all these weird messages about love.
00:20:04 It does.
00:20:06 An interstellar would be a great pick for talking about this, though,
00:20:11 but I don't think interstellar is pretentious.
00:20:14 I would use the word misguided.
00:20:16 The script is bad, it has a lot of plot holes,
00:20:21 it doesn't make a lot of sense,
00:20:23 it has some amazing scenes in it,
00:20:25 it has some amazing cinematography,
00:20:27 but the parts where they talk about love being the defining force of the galaxy,
00:20:30 I don't think the movie is pretending that it knows more than it does.
00:20:37 I just think it's incorrect.
00:20:39 I think there's a difference between being pretentious and just being wrong.
00:20:43 No, that's true, it doesn't necessarily make it pretentious, that's true,
00:20:46 but I'm just saying sometimes I think you can tell.
00:20:49 The word pretentious is just overused.
00:20:52 That's certainly true.
00:20:54 Let me propose an example of something that I think maybe actually is pretentious.
00:20:59 Okay, cool.
00:21:01 When I was younger, I listened to Dream Theater,
00:21:04 and they had an album called Metropolis Part 2, and I really liked it,
00:21:08 and I still think it's kind of good in some ways.
00:21:10 However, it always irked me about it,
00:21:12 because in the story of the album,
00:21:17 the guy discovers that he is a reincarnation of this person who was murdered
00:21:21 and her murder was never solved, and he's got to go and fucking solve her murder.
00:21:24 So you're saying he's a trans woman?
00:21:26 He used to be a woman, I was a man, okay.
00:21:28 And one of the songs in it is him sort of like opining and reflecting on the fact
00:21:33 that now that he knows that he is a reincarnated person,
00:21:37 he knows that death isn't the end, and he doesn't have to fear death anymore.
00:21:41 Okay.
00:21:42 And that's cool.
00:21:43 However, it's just a fucking fantasy construct in the story that happens.
00:21:47 I, the viewer, I haven't actually learned anything.
00:21:51 The story of the album has not actually showed me anything about the nature of life and death,
00:21:56 so it feels really cheap when this character can say,
00:21:59 oh, now I don't have to worry about death.
00:22:01 I can say, yeah, good for you, but you're living in the world of this album,
00:22:04 in this fantasy story, what about me?
00:22:06 I don't get it.
00:22:07 And you know, that reminds me so much.
00:22:09 I think if I'm presenting that, I think that...
00:22:11 I really need to piggyback on your story, Ben,
00:22:14 because, you know, that, again, I think that you could just as easily say that the story is just bad and misguided,
00:22:21 not necessarily that it's pretentious, however...
00:22:23 It seems like it thinks it's saying something about life and death,
00:22:29 but it hasn't actually said anything about it.
00:22:32 Let me tell you a little anecdote about Dream Theater.
00:22:35 I was listening to them back when I was like 15 or so,
00:22:39 pretty much just the album Train of Thought, which came right after Metropolis Part 2,
00:22:43 but I read an interview in a magazine called Revolver with them.
00:22:48 It was just like a one-page thing, and the interviewer asked them something to the effect of,
00:22:52 why do you guys think you're not more popular than you are or something like that?
00:22:55 One of the members literally said...
00:22:59 He said, there's bands like...
00:23:04 He named these by name.
00:23:06 He said there's bands like Mastodon, Tool, and the Mars Volta,
00:23:10 who are kind of like us, but not as good, and they're more popular.
00:23:15 So it's kind of like people like stuff that's less good
00:23:19 and people don't like us because we're too good.
00:23:22 He cracked the code.
00:23:25 For the record, for me at the time, my three favorite bands were Mastodon, Tool, and the Mars Volta.
00:23:32 I just read this like, wow, this is what pretentious actually means.
00:23:37 How does this feel, Digi, to not like things that are good, to only like the bad things?
00:23:41 You've become Anthony Fantano in the past.
00:23:46 It's like that episode of a regular show where they become so smart that no one could understand them.
00:23:53 It's like dream readers like that, that they become so good that nobody likes them.
00:24:00 I feel like, well, that's the thing though, right?
00:24:02 Because what too deep for you is...
00:24:04 Yeah, that's exactly what this is talking about.
00:24:06 Right, what too deep for you is when you make something that's just too much
00:24:10 and people can't quite wrap their head around it.
00:24:12 But I think that when it becomes pretentious is when the creator is saying,
00:24:18 oh, you're just idiots.
00:24:20 You don't get it because you're not smart enough.
00:24:22 It's like, well, we don't get it because we're not you
00:24:25 or we don't necessarily have the same life experiences required to understand it.
00:24:29 If any creator puts in stuff like that that no one could understand because it's from their life
00:24:34 and expects the audience to get that from just a viewing, that's pretentious, no doubt about it.
00:24:39 Well, that's basically Horst You Finale.
00:24:41 True, but I think, well, I guess we aren't really the right judges,
00:24:45 but we could tell what was going on, probably because we know you so well by this point.
00:24:49 I don't know if anyone else was...
00:24:51 I have no idea what the general audience, what it was like for an average audience member to watch Horst You Finale.
00:24:57 No fucking idea. It was probably brutal.
00:25:00 I am a very big fan of Horst You Finale and I am not unwilling to call it pretentious.
00:25:07 Well, I've seen a lot of people take a lot of things out of it.
00:25:11 In terms of positive feedback, some people have taken stuff out of it that I didn't necessarily intend,
00:25:17 but that I'm okay with them taking out of it.
00:25:20 And some people have come closer than others to...
00:25:23 I'm not going to say that you don't get it because everybody gets it to a degree, I think.
00:25:29 I don't call it pretentious.
00:25:31 I feel like there's parts of it that I don't get.
00:25:34 Not so much about the finale, but the Horst You Saga in general.
00:25:39 I think there are parts of it that I don't quite see the way that you...
00:25:42 For a long time, I've kind of dreaded people asking me to articulate it or explain it
00:25:51 because I feel like if...
00:25:54 I don't think that's your job anyway.
00:25:56 Yeah, it's not my job for one thing.
00:25:58 And if artists knew how to communicate verbally, we wouldn't be artists in the first place.
00:26:02 Thank you. That's a good point.
00:26:04 Man, that's something that I've been trying to make the point of.
00:26:06 That's what I talked about in my Hideyakeyano video.
00:26:08 Yeah, exactly. Hideyakeyano is what I always think about when I have worked on that.
00:26:13 Have I ever told you guys that I always wanted to communicate how much I love Gern Langen
00:26:18 and I really think that this video was my best possible way of making those points?
00:26:22 That's kind of a big part of why we all do what we do.
00:26:25 Right. I mean, that's how I kind of justify what I do
00:26:28 because there's a lot of times where I feel like this author surely understands the work himself
00:26:34 and could explain it except that he already did try to explain it.
00:26:37 Yeah, with the work itself. The work is the explanation.
00:26:40 I think the problem with everyone trying to seek answers from Hideyakeyano about what Eva means
00:26:46 is that I don't think he could do any better of a job than he did in the show.
00:26:50 He made the show to express these ideas.
00:26:54 I don't think he's necessarily capable of expressing them a different way.
00:26:57 That reminds me.
00:26:58 I can do it a different way because I don't make Evangelion.
00:27:03 That's not what I do. I look at other people's work.
00:27:06 I interpret it for myself and try to help other people to understand my interpretation
00:27:12 and maybe find some grounds for their own, but I couldn't make Eva
00:27:17 and I don't think Anno could make my Eva videos.
00:27:20 Probably true.
00:27:21 I don't think he could necessarily explain why the shot compositions are all so good
00:27:25 or why the character arcs are so good.
00:27:28 I agree. I used to read about great works of art of whatever form.
00:27:36 He did this. He uses this technique. He does that thing.
00:27:39 I was like, wow, you've got to know all these techniques to be a great artist,
00:27:43 but that's not true.
00:27:45 In a lot of cases, those techniques just come about naturally
00:27:50 from following your artistic inclinations and just doing what feels right.
00:27:54 I'm going to almost reverse-engineer it with my videos
00:27:59 because I haven't studied any of this from school.
00:28:03 I watch a lot of shows and then I go, huh, well, the way that shot was animated
00:28:08 made it have a lot of impact.
00:28:10 In the case of animation, I feel like they've probably kept going to school for it
00:28:13 and they understand it.
00:28:15 Hideaki Anno never opened up a textbook and read a chapter on how to compose
00:28:21 some fucking iconic scene or whatever.
00:28:24 Or some technique about structuring an episode in such and such way,
00:28:28 the one where it cuts away from the battle and then you see the aftermath.
00:28:31 No one taught him that.
00:28:33 They don't teach that stuff.
00:28:35 My brother Victor is in film school and he's watched all of every frame of paintings videos
00:28:40 and he's like, why isn't this taught in school?
00:28:42 Because we don't learn any of this.
00:28:44 We should be learning.
00:28:46 My point is that that's not the kind of thing you can teach.
00:28:48 That's the kind of thing that has to be generated creatively.
00:28:51 That's true.
00:28:52 But what do they teach?
00:28:53 What is the focus on in such things?
00:28:57 I haven't taken the classes.
00:28:59 This is a 4x 720 camera lens and it goes on.
00:29:06 They teach you more like how to get into the industry.
00:29:10 Do you need four years of that?
00:29:12 You've got to remember that most of the people making movies are making shitty movies.
00:29:16 That's true.
00:29:17 All of them have been through college.
00:29:19 All of them have taken the classes, but most of them are still garbage.
00:29:22 It's almost like there's something more important than that.
00:29:25 Weird.
00:29:26 Weird.
00:29:27 It's almost like creative spark is what matters the most and understanding having inspiration
00:29:32 and being able to translate it into a medium that people can appreciate.
00:29:37 Do you say something?
00:29:39 I was going to say, if we're talking about the communication abilities,
00:29:45 it's pretty obvious from my own podcasting prowess that I'm not very good at speaking
00:29:52 to communicate my ideas.
00:29:56 If it comes out at all, it's from the weird videos that I make and the comedy videos.
00:30:00 Which we all love.
00:30:03 I don't think I'd ever be able to get anything across through speaking and writing as much
00:30:09 as I would through my stupid jokes.
00:30:12 By the way, guys, Hippo is currently freezing his ass off in his retarded ass apartment that
00:30:17 has no heat right now.
00:30:19 He's a real trooper for being here with us.
00:30:21 Are you going to give me a round of applause?
00:30:23 You do sound like you're in Russia right now.
00:30:28 Yeah, you sound really cold.
00:30:31 You deserve credit for doing it anyway.
00:30:34 Okay, I don't think that was important, but thanks.
00:30:37 I want to say that this topic reminds me of one that Mr. B-Tongue video where he talks about art in other words.
00:30:44 I don't remember that one.
00:30:47 There are no other words.
00:30:50 If you try to explain a work of art, you're reducing it.
00:30:54 What Digi was saying, the art itself is the explanation.
00:30:57 Which also reminds me of a quote.
00:30:59 I'm probably going to butcher it, but it's something like, writing about music is like dancing about architecture.
00:31:04 Yeah, that's a good one.
00:31:06 There are no other words.
00:31:08 What's great about that, the funny thing is you brought that quote up.
00:31:12 I've often heard that people use that quote to say, like, don't write about music.
00:31:19 And people rebel against that.
00:31:21 People hate that term.
00:31:22 People hate that phrase, rather, because they see it as like,
00:31:25 oh, you're trying to, because my initial response when I heard that was,
00:31:29 well, I'd love to see a fucking dance about architecture.
00:31:31 I was just going to say that.
00:31:33 Like, I don't disagree with what he's saying.
00:31:36 I just think that it's not necessarily an indictment of the practice I think.
00:31:40 Right, right.
00:31:41 You know, I want to ask you guys, what?
00:31:44 Dancing about architecture.
00:31:45 I love the idea.
00:31:46 I love the idea.
00:31:47 Fucking awesome.
00:31:48 I imagine it would be done to an Autecher song, and they have like,
00:31:52 you know, the guy who created Gundam, Yoshiyuki Tomino,
00:31:56 his daughter does like interpretive dance and teaches it.
00:31:59 And if you watch the most recent Gundam show,
00:32:03 Recon Gesta NG, the most recent one that he directed,
00:32:06 which is fucking insanity, the whole show,
00:32:08 there's like all the eye catches are like the characters dancing,
00:32:11 like doing interpretive dance,
00:32:13 and his daughter actually choreographed them.
00:32:15 Hey, that's pretty tight.
00:32:16 It's pretty cool.
00:32:17 That was a random fact.
00:32:19 I want to ask you guys now, did you change topic?
00:32:21 I like that.
00:32:22 No, that's cool.
00:32:23 Although Gundam Reco G Reco is perfect for this,
00:32:26 because that is the most too deep for you.
00:32:29 Really?
00:32:30 No one understands it, literally no one,
00:32:33 because there's so much random weird symbolism that makes no sense,
00:32:38 and like random moments of just insanity that no one gets to show.
00:32:42 And Tomino himself like later admitted that he completely failed.
00:32:46 He was like, yeah, he was like, I don't know why I thought this would work,
00:32:50 or why I thought this was a good idea.
00:32:51 Something like this, is it in fact a case that it was in fact not too deep for you,
00:32:55 was simply bad?
00:32:56 I think it was, I think it was both.
00:33:00 The show's not necessarily like all bad,
00:33:03 but like it's very clear that Tomino,
00:33:06 that all of the things in the show meant something to him.
00:33:09 It's just that what that meaning is,
00:33:11 is not something that most people can grasp.
00:33:14 You know what it really is at that point?
00:33:16 It's at that point you have to like struggle with something like that,
00:33:19 I mean how willing are you to do the research,
00:33:22 to like do whatever is required to figure out what everything means,
00:33:25 versus just watch it and then move on with your life.
00:33:28 And like I get it on some level because I have seen a lot of Tomino's stuff,
00:33:32 and all of it, there's like a general theme of his work is chaos.
00:33:37 Like he presents war and the scenarios of war as this chaotic, insane thing.
00:33:44 Like when you watch, like there's a movie called Gundam F91,
00:33:47 which is like pretty standalone in the continuity,
00:33:50 and like the first 30 minutes of it are just like trying to show you how chaotic war is,
00:33:54 and it completely like works and makes sense,
00:33:57 because it's really well produced,
00:33:59 and clearly there were people who knew what they were doing working on it.
00:34:02 You know it has like cool ideas,
00:34:04 but then like he'll do the same thing in another show,
00:34:07 but it doesn't, you don't get that it's about chaos,
00:34:10 it just is chaos, so you don't know what it's about.
00:34:13 Yeah, you know the thing is, I feel like the term is probably applied most
00:34:18 by the people who like take the time least to understand whatever it is they're talking about,
00:34:24 and like they're obviously not qualified to make such a judgment,
00:34:27 and yet that's kind of what sticks with things,
00:34:29 like you're saying with this war shit.
00:34:31 A lot of people are downright anti-intellectual about art.
00:34:33 That's right.
00:34:34 People hate when you say that art is deep.
00:34:36 They're like oh it's all just supposed to be fun,
00:34:38 games are just fun, games are only allowed to be fun.
00:34:41 Maybe we should talk about, they don't need depth.
00:34:43 We should probably talk about the stigma there.
00:34:45 Why is it people are so uncomfortable with things being outside of their grasp?
00:34:49 Is it just they're offended by the idea that they aren't on, you know,
00:34:53 able to appreciate it?
00:34:55 Is that just offend them, and they have this reaction?
00:34:57 I think it's intellectual cowardice.
00:34:58 Personally a lot of things I find are too deep for me,
00:35:01 but I enjoy trying to figure them out anyway,
00:35:03 so I think the reason a lot of people might hate the idea of things being intellectual
00:35:10 is because generally very intellectual people are snobbish.
00:35:14 Yeah, yeah.
00:35:15 There's some sort of like I'm better than you,
00:35:19 sort of trying to fight against that.
00:35:21 A deep work of art makes you work to understand it,
00:35:24 so it's asking more of the viewer,
00:35:26 and it's also kind of, well it means that you can either work harder to understand it,
00:35:31 or you can just like be, I don't know, smarter or whatever you want to call it.
00:35:35 So it's like if you're not smart enough to appreciate it, it's kind of an insult?
00:35:39 Yeah, people are saying like, oh are you saying I'm dumb?
00:35:42 I think the best resistance I would have against that,
00:35:46 and I would just say, I'm not telling you you have to care.
00:35:50 There's a sort of mentality in pop media where people think that everyone has to like everything,
00:35:55 and everything has to be for everyone,
00:35:57 and it shouldn't be.
00:35:59 I would like it much more if things were not made for everyone.
00:36:03 Like look at the AAA gaming scene, it caters to like the mass majority,
00:36:07 and as a result games are worse, they're more homogenous.
00:36:10 It's not as interesting.
00:36:11 I mean it's a thing, it's a matter of, I think that there's,
00:36:15 I like using the terms broad and niche,
00:36:18 where a broad piece of entertainment is made to appeal to as many people as possible,
00:36:22 but it will only appeal to them on a very shallow level.
00:36:26 Whereas when you make something niche that appeals to just like five people,
00:36:31 but to those people it like means everything in the world.
00:36:34 Yeah, once more valuable you have to ask.
00:36:37 Right, so I mean I appreciate why broad media exists,
00:36:41 and it can be a great way to get people into media in general,
00:36:44 and help them to develop like the lexicon of whatever media they're looking at.
00:36:50 If you go out to see a film, because everyone's talking about it, it appeals to everyone,
00:36:54 and then you learn how to appreciate film,
00:36:57 then you can go deeper and find the stuff that just appeals to you.
00:37:01 But like, I think people shame niche media for not being for them,
00:37:07 and it's like, not everything has to be about you dude,
00:37:10 like everyone can like their own shit.
00:37:14 Most of my favorite things are things that are not very widely appreciated,
00:37:20 but they mean a lot to me.
00:37:22 Yeah, yeah.
00:37:24 And I'm not saying anyone's stupid for not liking stuff I like.
00:37:28 I think that most people are just evil.
00:37:31 I would use the word lazy, I think in this case.
00:37:34 Evil, stupid, and lazy.
00:37:36 Is there a difference between evil and lazy?
00:37:38 You know?
00:37:40 I don't know.
00:37:41 Well I think any of those three things, evil, stupid, and lazy,
00:37:44 can become each other by being to a great enough degree.
00:37:47 That's true, that's certainly true.
00:37:49 Yeah, let me interject the second.
00:37:52 I think that a lot of people, when they say that something's deep,
00:37:55 I mean, we're talking about depth,
00:37:57 and I think when we say that, we mean that a thing is thematically rich
00:38:01 and complex and robust.
00:38:03 I think what a lot of people think that the word means
00:38:07 is that it tackles a like very significant theme,
00:38:11 like some like heavy theme, like I don't know, God or whatever.
00:38:15 I don't know if people would assume that.
00:38:17 No, I think you're right, because there's a lot of people who,
00:38:20 a lot of the people who get mad at me for liking stuff like K-On,
00:38:24 people will say it's just shallow, it's not deep,
00:38:27 and K-On has a lot of depth of characterization
00:38:30 and a lot of depth of showing you the human experience.
00:38:33 It tells you something about what people are and what we care about,
00:38:36 but yeah, I think most people, when they think depth,
00:38:39 are definitely thinking it should teach us something about world religion
00:38:43 or psychology or child beating.
00:38:46 That's part of the misunderstanding of Eva.
00:38:48 People think that it's deep because of all the Christian whatever,
00:38:52 and then when they find out that stuff is not really that meaningful,
00:38:56 they say, oh, well, it wasn't deep after all,
00:38:58 but really that's not where the depth is.
00:39:00 The depth into Shiji's character and the way he grows and the whole,
00:39:03 yeah, all that shit, yeah.
00:39:05 That's interesting.
00:39:06 And also I think if a thing tries to tackle some,
00:39:10 I don't know, quote unquote deep philosophical topic,
00:39:13 like the nature of reality or something,
00:39:15 like say, I don't know, kind of like...
00:39:18 Charlie Kaufman shit or...
00:39:20 Yeah, or something like that.
00:39:22 And they, and it fails.
00:39:24 Then I think that that's more, that's worse in a way,
00:39:28 and it looks worse than trying to tackle something more humble,
00:39:31 like, you know, high school girls' relationships like K-On does.
00:39:36 And so I think it's more prone to people seeing it,
00:39:39 being unimpressed with like what's being said,
00:39:42 and being like, it's pretending to be deep, but it's not.
00:39:46 Basically people are focusing on the wrong thing
00:39:48 when they're checking for the too deep for you stat.
00:39:51 Like people aren't going to call K-On,
00:39:55 even if K-On was a shit show,
00:39:57 people wouldn't call it too deep for you, ironically.
00:40:00 They wouldn't say it was pretentious
00:40:02 because they didn't think that it was trying to be deep,
00:40:05 because in their mind, deep means like, you know,
00:40:08 heady philosophical or whatever.
00:40:10 It's not deep if a child doesn't get beaten.
00:40:13 Right. If K-On, for example, like put in a thing
00:40:16 that was like, this is the definitive analysis
00:40:20 of high school girl relationships,
00:40:22 and then failed, like that would make it pretentious,
00:40:24 that would make it, you know,
00:40:26 if it did something like, if it makes some great claim about truth
00:40:29 and then fails, that's what I see.
00:40:31 Well, okay, let me, I want to move on to another topic here, guys.
00:40:34 So I want to ask, what do you do
00:40:36 when you encounter something that is too deep for you,
00:40:39 what that process is like for you?
00:40:41 I think I probably know. Never happens.
00:40:43 Never happens. Of course it never happens.
00:40:45 I watched Eraserhead not too long ago.
00:40:47 Too cultured.
00:40:49 And my first thought upon seeing was like,
00:40:51 okay, this is super pretentious.
00:40:53 I mean, I just don't get it, but everyone loves it,
00:40:55 so I'll give the benefit of that out
00:40:57 and try to figure out what's going on here.
00:40:59 And the cool, I mean, that is completely off the wall.
00:41:01 There's these ridiculous things happening all the time.
00:41:03 But when you step back and you look at it
00:41:05 and you think about, I mean, I had to look all this shit up.
00:41:07 I didn't figure it out. But everything that's happening
00:41:09 really does make sense.
00:41:11 And it's perfectly parsable once you know
00:41:13 like the symbolism and you are able to understand
00:41:15 what's going on.
00:41:17 I also, I watched Eraserhead a couple years ago
00:41:19 on YouTube.
00:41:21 Yeah, it was the kind of thing where like,
00:41:23 I enjoyed the overall experience
00:41:25 and I got like vaguely what it was about.
00:41:27 Like, obviously it's about
00:41:29 dealing with relationships and childbirth.
00:41:31 Like, it's about this awkward guy,
00:41:33 he hooks up with this girl
00:41:35 and everything's super fucking weird and awkward.
00:41:37 And like, you can easily look at it
00:41:39 and say like, well, it's all just,
00:41:41 this is just normal shit, but it's weird.
00:41:43 And it's like, yeah, but the point is that
00:41:45 it's how you're perceiving it.
00:41:47 That's what art is, it's taking something
00:41:49 and explaining it in a different way.
00:41:51 He's explaining his anxiety by way of
00:41:53 constant fucking metal noises
00:41:55 in the background and like,
00:41:57 weird architecture and shit.
00:41:59 And by having the baby
00:42:01 be a literal monster.
00:42:03 And it's like, if you look at it, you go like,
00:42:05 what does this mean? And it's like, it probably means
00:42:07 that babies are fucking monsters,
00:42:09 you know, it probably means that the idea of
00:42:11 childbirth sickens and disturbs this man
00:42:13 and the way he still is, and he still
00:42:15 kind of likes it, like he's got those warm
00:42:17 feelings for it sometimes. Oh, it's good stuff.
00:42:19 It's good stuff, I like it. And that's what, I mean,
00:42:21 that's exactly what the director has said
00:42:23 that he was going through at the time. He was
00:42:25 paranoid about having a kid, you know,
00:42:27 and that movie reflected his paranoia.
00:42:29 It all makes perfect sense if you just look into
00:42:31 it a little bit. And so for that reason, like,
00:42:33 one person's definitely going to call that too deep
00:42:35 for you, but I think a more
00:42:37 informed person
00:42:39 would say no, it's, I get it.
00:42:41 I'd like us each to tell
00:42:43 a story about this, so Hippo, I want to hear you
00:42:45 tell a, well, you can say what you were going to say
00:42:47 first, but. Well, I was just going to say
00:42:49 there's, I think there's like a difference between
00:42:51 getting
00:42:53 like a piece of media and understanding
00:42:55 the depths, because
00:42:57 I, when I come across something
00:42:59 that I, turns out is too deep
00:43:01 for me, like Ava, I didn't understand
00:43:03 it a lot, but I still enjoyed it, and I
00:43:05 got it, but I couldn't ever tell anybody
00:43:07 I couldn't, like
00:43:09 if somebody else did. Yeah, I couldn't
00:43:11 explain. I didn't know what
00:43:13 I'd liked about it, but I knew that I, you know, I
00:43:15 got it, kind of.
00:43:17 And that's how it usually is
00:43:19 with, like,
00:43:21 like, say Gurren Lagann had
00:43:23 lots more, like, in
00:43:25 the subtext than I would ever
00:43:27 have thought about. Dude, nobody gets
00:43:29 Gurren Lagann the first time they see it, nobody.
00:43:31 And, and it's like, I really
00:43:33 liked it, I really liked it,
00:43:35 but, like, you explaining it in your video
00:43:37 made it, like, extra cool.
00:43:39 Yeah, I, and that's what I was hoping
00:43:41 to do, to just lay it on the line for people.
00:43:43 So, yeah, so when, like, something's
00:43:45 too deep, it, as long as it's
00:43:47 got other elements to it, then
00:43:49 it's great.
00:43:51 I think that experience you're describing happens
00:43:53 a lot, both with Ava and, especially
00:43:55 with the show Serial Experiments Lane,
00:43:57 which is an anime series that, like,
00:43:59 most people say that they have to watch it
00:44:01 four times before they, like, before it, like,
00:44:03 clicks with them. I've seen it twice enough, no idea
00:44:05 what's going on. It was funny, though, because, like,
00:44:07 you're halfway there. All right. It was one
00:44:09 of those things for me, because I watched it
00:44:11 for the first, like, all the way through for the first time
00:44:13 when I was 14, and, like,
00:44:15 everyone had said that it takes them four tries
00:44:17 and they don't get it, and then I watched it, and I felt
00:44:19 like I got it, like, I was like, okay, I get the
00:44:21 point, I get what they're going for here, you know,
00:44:23 but, like, a lot of the specifics didn't
00:44:25 make sense to me, and then it was only,
00:44:27 like, you know, like, five years
00:44:29 later I watched it again, and I was like,
00:44:31 I didn't get this before,
00:44:33 like, I thought I did, but I clearly
00:44:35 didn't, because I get it now,
00:44:37 and what I feel now is totally
00:44:39 different from what I felt then, you know,
00:44:41 and eventually I made a series of videos
00:44:43 about it, but, like,
00:44:45 yeah, you know, I think
00:44:47 that effort, that willingness
00:44:49 that you talked about, Hippo,
00:44:51 I made a video about this called Art Is All
00:44:53 About Pressing Your Buttons, about, like,
00:44:55 why I will nit-pick
00:44:57 a show that I don't like so hard,
00:44:59 but with a show I do like,
00:45:01 I'll ignore so many of its flaws,
00:45:03 and it's because, like,
00:45:05 well, there's, like, a give and take between you
00:45:07 and the art, right, like,
00:45:09 a show that I can't stand is Ergo Proxy,
00:45:11 which is an anime series that's really,
00:45:13 it's super too deep
00:45:15 for you, you know, I've
00:45:17 literally called it Pretentious in the past,
00:45:19 that it was the only anime I was willing to call Pretentious,
00:45:21 because it does, it's, like,
00:45:23 way up its own ass with, like, symbolism
00:45:25 and rhetoric and stuff that doesn't
00:45:27 really seem like it means much in the context
00:45:29 of the show, it just seems like it's there
00:45:31 for the sake of having depth, you know, having
00:45:33 deep shit, but, like, you know,
00:45:35 I've had people tell me that
00:45:37 Ergo Proxy, that there are meanings to it,
00:45:39 there's all this stuff that I didn't get,
00:45:41 and it's, like, on the one hand,
00:45:43 I don't disbelieve
00:45:45 those people, but I don't
00:45:47 want to find out, like,
00:45:49 I hate the show, I don't want
00:45:51 to sit there and watch it again until I get it,
00:45:53 you know, like, I'm willing to accept
00:45:55 that maybe there is actual depth there
00:45:57 or that it makes sense if you think about it,
00:45:59 but, like, I don't want
00:46:01 to, whereas other shows, like,
00:46:03 it's kind of like, you know, a show
00:46:05 that needs, like, a balance of shallowness
00:46:07 and depth for it to be really good.
00:46:09 I don't think it has to have shallowness, I just
00:46:11 think it has to press your buttons right, you know?
00:46:13 Well, yeah, like, did you
00:46:15 say, like, he has to have some surface appeal?
00:46:17 That's true.
00:46:19 Did you not hold, like, his audience
00:46:21 hostage and say, like, you have to get this,
00:46:23 and in the same respect, he doesn't, you know,
00:46:25 you shouldn't say did you have to get everything, too.
00:46:27 Yeah, like, Ergo Proxy,
00:46:29 a lot of people like the show because
00:46:31 it has, like, a really good atmosphere,
00:46:33 has beautiful artwork, you know,
00:46:35 like, interesting characters and stuff, so, like...
00:46:37 And the best ending theme song in all of anime, baby!
00:46:39 Yeah, it's got a...
00:46:41 Paranoid Android, dude. Yeah, Paranoid Android by
00:46:43 I keep...
00:46:45 For both song and band,
00:46:47 I was thinking OK Computer, which is the name
00:46:49 of the album, but, like,
00:46:51 yeah, Ergo Proxy has a lot of things
00:46:53 that will draw certain people in,
00:46:55 and they certainly drew me in, but then there was
00:46:57 so much that I didn't like that in the end
00:46:59 I didn't care about it, whereas there are shows
00:47:01 that, like, that I think have
00:47:03 very little surface appeal,
00:47:05 but I still like them,
00:47:07 like, a 12 ounce mouse, like,
00:47:09 which is just ugliest sin
00:47:11 and weird
00:47:13 and slow and
00:47:15 doesn't make any sense, but it does have,
00:47:17 like, a super deep metanarrative
00:47:19 behind it, like, if you watch the whole
00:47:21 show, you'll... I never saw that.
00:47:23 If you watch the whole show, you'll quickly grasp
00:47:25 that there's, like, a whole plot behind it,
00:47:27 like, it is actually a narrative show.
00:47:29 It just doesn't make a lot of sense, and it was
00:47:31 unfinished, so, like, a lot of the answers
00:47:33 have never come out. Oh, no, the, like, 12 ounce mouse
00:47:35 doesn't have a surface appeal, because I
00:47:37 liked it immediately.
00:47:39 Okay, but not everybody really. I would say
00:47:41 it has some surface appeal in that it has,
00:47:43 like, great voice acting, like,
00:47:45 phenomenal voice acting, and it's funny
00:47:47 and weird, you know, but, like,
00:47:49 I don't expect anyone
00:47:51 to look at that show
00:47:53 and immediately be like, oh, yeah, I totally
00:47:55 want to find the hidden depth in fucking
00:47:57 12 ounce mouse, like, most people are going to look at it
00:47:59 and go, what is that, you know? I kind of think
00:48:01 you might be driven to do that by,
00:48:03 just by how, like,
00:48:05 uncommonly terrible its presentation is.
00:48:07 I think maybe the terribleness of
00:48:09 the presentation is part of the surface appeal.
00:48:11 Well, sure, but that's kind of also a thing with,
00:48:13 I don't know, like, what's that one, perfect
00:48:15 hair forever? It kind of reminds me of that,
00:48:17 and I don't think there's a lot of depth and
00:48:19 perfect hair forever. No. I think it really is
00:48:21 just the surface stuff. Not quite the same.
00:48:23 No, I'm just saying that that can be a form
00:48:25 of appeal, is lack
00:48:27 of appeal, if you know what I'm saying.
00:48:29 Yeah, I agree
00:48:31 and I think that would be why some people
00:48:33 might get into perfect, I mean, like, even
00:48:35 without depth, like, sometimes people like
00:48:37 shit just because it's so ugly
00:48:39 and out there, you know? Sure.
00:48:41 But, like, I would pause it,
00:48:43 that, like, if I were to
00:48:45 make, like, some just shitty,
00:48:47 like, let's say, I've tried to make
00:48:49 Jesse Wood's horse shoe saga, but I had
00:48:51 none of the talent.
00:48:53 Like, I'm just a weird, kind of ugly
00:48:55 basement dweller
00:48:57 who doesn't know how to film, whose audio is garbage.
00:48:59 Like, not garbage in a way
00:49:01 that's, like, endearing, but garbage
00:49:03 in a way that's too harsh for you to listen to.
00:49:05 I don't know which parts of that were about me
00:49:07 and which parts were about a guy with no talent.
00:49:09 No, I'm saying, I'm saying
00:49:11 this is a, this is an alternate universe
00:49:13 version of you who has none of the things
00:49:15 that you have going for you. Like, you know
00:49:17 how to, you know how to make a great set,
00:49:19 you have amazing charisma and camera
00:49:21 presence, you know how to write a fucking
00:49:23 type script. One piece of paper with a crayon word
00:49:25 scrawled on it, taped to his bookshelf.
00:49:27 Ten out of ten. It's awesome.
00:49:29 It is awesome, I know, I totally agree.
00:49:31 Everything, everything feels right
00:49:33 in a Jesse Wood video, you know, like
00:49:35 the audio is not necessarily perfect
00:49:37 but it works and the
00:49:39 video quality is not necessarily perfect
00:49:41 but it works. He doesn't have to be fucking
00:49:43 MKBHD for his videos to make sense,
00:49:45 you know, but like,
00:49:47 if I was making the same kind of story
00:49:49 and it was every bit
00:49:51 as deep to me
00:49:53 as the horseshoe saga, but
00:49:55 the writing was like,
00:49:57 do any of you guys watch that
00:49:59 what's his name, Roger Vanderweed guy, that
00:50:01 Davoo is like a fan of? No.
00:50:03 Where his, his writing
00:50:05 is like completely incomprehensible, even though
00:50:07 like, the points he's making are
00:50:09 great and make sense, but you have to
00:50:11 parse this unbelievably difficult
00:50:13 right, in fact he's a, he's basically
00:50:15 who I'm talking about now that I think about it
00:50:17 because his videos are like, weird,
00:50:19 terrible, the audio is way too harsh,
00:50:21 you can't understand what he's saying, the videos
00:50:23 are like, ugly, weird flash animations
00:50:25 of Sonic characters,
00:50:27 he's talking about bullshit
00:50:29 and insanity, yeah, that guy.
00:50:31 The guy who does like Sonic Analyze
00:50:33 with the two, with the two cartoon guys
00:50:35 talking, oh it's so hideous, I hate it.
00:50:37 Yeah, and like, the presentation of them is
00:50:39 so bad that I legit, I can't
00:50:41 get into it, but like, Davoo
00:50:43 like, has gotten into it
00:50:45 and he's even said, he was like, if I found him today
00:50:47 with the standards I have now for like, presentation
00:50:49 there's no way I'd get into it,
00:50:51 but like, because I already am
00:50:53 into it and I know like, what's going on
00:50:55 in the narrative, then it's
00:50:57 you know, he appreciates it
00:50:59 and like, if someone tried
00:51:01 to do the horseshoe saga with
00:51:03 even less skills than Roger van der Weed
00:51:05 then like, no one would
00:51:07 watch it, you know, no one would
00:51:09 appreciate it, but that doesn't mean it's not
00:51:11 deep or that it's not good.
00:51:13 Not to criticize Jesse's presentation
00:51:15 but I think that probably is
00:51:17 at least some portion of that is why
00:51:19 it hasn't reached as big an audience
00:51:21 as you know, we all wish that it would.
00:51:23 I think at a certain point
00:51:25 my continuity
00:51:27 became too much
00:51:29 for your average person.
00:51:31 Yeah, that's certainly true.
00:51:33 Like a lot of the horseshoe reviews
00:51:35 if you were
00:51:37 just going into them as single reviews
00:51:39 would be fucking
00:51:41 horrible to watch.
00:51:43 Well, I mean, the things would be confusing
00:51:45 so some things certainly would be.
00:51:47 You know, when you launched Serialized
00:51:49 Victor, my brother
00:51:51 was like, he was confused
00:51:53 because he thought Man Child Incorporated
00:51:55 when you put out the video that was announcing
00:51:57 that Man Child Incorporated was now a thing
00:51:59 he thought that was the endless jest channel
00:52:01 and that you just changed it again.
00:52:03 So he was like, he literally
00:52:05 got mad after the first Serialized
00:52:07 and he was like, I don't see
00:52:09 the point of it, he was like, who is this for?
00:52:11 And I said, well, it's for like
00:52:13 the Pony fans who've gone on and I was like
00:52:15 it's a new series without the continuity
00:52:17 and he said, but Corona was right
00:52:19 there in the first episode
00:52:21 so this doesn't make any sense.
00:52:23 And I was like, well, I guess and then I
00:52:25 explained to him that, well, it's not
00:52:27 it's not Endless Jest, it's the Pony channel
00:52:29 that's transformed and so it's part
00:52:31 of the same narrative in a way.
00:52:33 They really are all interrelated though.
00:52:35 That's like the best, I love that.
00:52:37 You can hear me in the background.
00:52:39 No more continuity vows so many times
00:52:41 I know you have. You can't let go.
00:52:43 I don't think you should let it go though.
00:52:45 I don't think the problem with your show is
00:52:47 well, let's separate, you know,
00:52:49 as a piece of art, I do not want
00:52:51 Jesse to ever stop doing what he's doing
00:52:53 but like for his own sake, it probably
00:52:55 would be best. Well, I don't think it's
00:52:57 my immediate thought when I started
00:52:59 Endless Jest was, okay,
00:53:01 new beginning, it's new rules, I'm gonna
00:53:03 all the stuff that I did, I'm gonna
00:53:05 do it differently, no continuity,
00:53:07 no reviews and now
00:53:09 it's like six months later and
00:53:11 now I'm just like, you know what,
00:53:13 actually a lot of that stuff is pretty cool.
00:53:15 I gotta take
00:53:17 the stuff that I like about me
00:53:19 discard the stuff that I don't like about me
00:53:21 but still keep the cool stuff.
00:53:23 You know some of the things you like about yourself
00:53:25 aren't necessarily marketable
00:53:27 and I think that's true of all of us.
00:53:29 I think we need a fucking sitcom about
00:53:31 Cold Corona. I would love
00:53:33 a Cold Corona sitcom, that would be great.
00:53:35 Man, I have such plans
00:53:37 in store for Cold Corona guys.
00:53:39 I'm excited.
00:53:41 The serialized saga is going to places
00:53:43 that no one could anticipate.
00:53:45 That sounds amazing.
00:53:47 I think to get back to the whole
00:53:49 art being about pressing your buttons
00:53:51 shit like that. Here's the thing
00:53:53 about Jesse's content.
00:53:55 Even a show like 12 oz mouse
00:53:57 which has no obvious appeal, right?
00:53:59 The reason people got into
00:54:01 that show is that it was on television.
00:54:03 It was literally
00:54:05 in a block where people were going
00:54:07 to watch anyways.
00:54:09 So even if a hundred thousand people
00:54:11 saw it and 99% of them
00:54:13 didn't understand it at all,
00:54:15 1,000 people are still there who are
00:54:17 totally going to love it and get invested
00:54:19 in the story and understand it in the long run.
00:54:21 I think the problem with trying to do this
00:54:23 on YouTube is that there's no real
00:54:25 platform by which
00:54:27 it's one thing
00:54:29 if I make a video saying
00:54:31 hey you should all watch Jesse because
00:54:33 he's basically just like me, then
00:54:35 people who are looking for something just like me
00:54:37 will go watch Jesse and they won't get it.
00:54:39 But like
00:54:41 there's no like TV channel
00:54:43 that is full of things that are kind
00:54:45 of like Jesse that he can be
00:54:47 broadcasted on and then people find out about it.
00:54:49 What he needs really is just
00:54:51 a foot in the door. All he needs is there
00:54:53 to be one video that was
00:54:55 attractive enough and got big enough
00:54:57 that people get curious about it
00:54:59 and then they are along for the ride.
00:55:01 The Batz video has over a million
00:55:03 views now. 2 million
00:55:05 2 million worthless views
00:55:07 that haven't translated to anything.
00:55:09 The video was blocked for
00:55:11 monetization within the first day.
00:55:13 I've seen no revenue from it
00:55:15 and nobody subscribed because
00:55:17 you should have contested that
00:55:19 you'd have at least 2 grand by now.
00:55:21 You think that the people who like this,
00:55:23 my little pony review would want to see more like it
00:55:25 because there's plenty more like it.
00:55:27 And the worst part is that if I took down the Batz review
00:55:29 and reposted it, it wouldn't get views anymore.
00:55:31 No, it's in the
00:55:33 YouTube feed cycle somehow.
00:55:35 It's due to the initial momentum
00:55:37 from when it was released.
00:55:41 But anyways,
00:55:43 I forget it. No, go on, go on.
00:55:45 I think we're running low on
00:55:47 stuff. Yeah, not to just talk
00:55:49 about myself,
00:55:51 which would be the most pretentious and too deep.
00:55:53 That'll be next week's topic, yeah.
00:55:55 Oh god, we could go on
00:55:57 for fucking hours.
00:55:59 I'm surprised. I could go on for this topic
00:56:01 for quite a bit longer.
00:56:03 I was talking like
00:56:05 fucking a while ago
00:56:07 when I first mentioned Horseshoe Finale
00:56:09 and how for a long time I wasn't sure
00:56:11 how I could articulate it to people
00:56:13 if anyone asked me. Right.
00:56:15 But I finally figured out, I finally got
00:56:17 the sentence in my head
00:56:19 that I can give to people now
00:56:21 if they ever ask me what it's about.
00:56:23 The simplest way that I can explain it
00:56:25 is that it's a retelling of a Christmas Carol.
00:56:29 I see. That's pretty good.
00:56:31 What's a retelling of a Christmas Carol?
00:56:33 Horseshoe Finale, or the Horseshoe Saga.
00:56:35 It's a story about a guy
00:56:37 who turns into this
00:56:39 fucking big bastard
00:56:41 but then he's confronted with his past
00:56:43 and his decisions and where he is now
00:56:45 and he has to come out of it.
00:56:47 And that's the main thing.
00:56:49 I really don't understand the Horseshoe Saga, do I?
00:56:53 I think you did fine in the Horseshoe
00:56:55 Finale, explaining it as
00:56:57 a wrestling narrative. I agree.
00:56:59 I think that, again, like the art
00:57:01 is the explanation, but
00:57:03 I was saying that I was struggling for a long time
00:57:05 to come up with a sentence that I can throw at people.
00:57:07 You know what's an element? Yeah.
00:57:09 What did I call it in my video, the Top 10?
00:57:11 Like, just the biggest come ever?
00:57:13 Well, that's just going to be my
00:57:15 go-to to throw at people
00:57:17 if anyone asked me.
00:57:19 The world's largest end zone dance after
00:57:21 the world's largest end zone dance
00:57:23 after the series of touchdowns that was
00:57:25 the Horseshoe Saga. That's right.
00:57:27 It's a disgustingly well-made MLP reviews, blah, blah, blah.
00:57:29 Does anybody else
00:57:31 want to bring up an example
00:57:33 of something that was too deep for them
00:57:35 experience before we wrap
00:57:37 things up? Because I know, did you mention that before?
00:57:39 You got a bunch of those. I forgot
00:57:41 if you had one or not.
00:57:43 Oh, did you? Yeah, if you want to do one?
00:57:45 Well, I could, but I want to hear Jesse first, because we didn't get to him.
00:57:47 That's true. Hippo did one, I think.
00:57:49 There's one creator
00:57:53 who I specifically view
00:57:55 as a pretentious
00:57:57 fucking knob-sucker,
00:57:59 and I hate all of his work.
00:58:01 Hey, hey.
00:58:03 Don't say that about Max Landis. He's a good man.
00:58:05 He's the
00:58:07 director, Lars van Trier.
00:58:09 Oh, yes.
00:58:11 I hate him. Somehow I should have known.
00:58:13 I've seen all of his movies.
00:58:15 Wow. When he releases a new movie,
00:58:17 I make a point to see it just so I can
00:58:19 hate it.
00:58:21 Or just so that I can see how much
00:58:23 I hate it.
00:58:25 Fun fact, I only ever
00:58:27 saw the first five minutes of Antichrist.
00:58:29 My friends were watching it on Netflix,
00:58:31 and I looked at it and I went, this is fucking pretentious
00:58:33 and I left the room.
00:58:35 Okay, he makes like
00:58:37 he makes exploitation movies.
00:58:39 That's what they are.
00:58:41 But rather than just
00:58:43 say like a Quentin Tarantino
00:58:45 would say, I make exploitation
00:58:47 movies. Isn't it great?
00:58:49 He's got to fucking put it in black and white
00:58:51 piano music. He's got to make it three hours
00:58:53 long and try to convince people
00:58:55 that it's like the most mind-blowing
00:58:57 complex thing ever
00:58:59 and people fall for it. This is the
00:59:01 greatest director of all time. He's amazing
00:59:03 and it's just fucking schlock.
00:59:05 It's just William Defoe's penis getting
00:59:07 stabbed to the screw. It's just fucking
00:59:09 Mary Jane
00:59:11 laying in a bathtub naked
00:59:13 being depressed for four
00:59:15 fucking hours.
00:59:17 Oh my god, I hate him. His movies
00:59:19 are so fucking
00:59:21 droll and boring. No, no, no.
00:59:23 Droll means interesting. Droll means cool.
00:59:25 Droll does not mean cool.
00:59:27 Droll means funny. We had this fight before
00:59:29 me and Ben had a huge fight about it once.
00:59:31 Turns out I was right. Well, I guess, I guess
00:59:33 droll is too deep for me.
00:59:35 Loveiest droll.
00:59:37 Yeah.
00:59:39 Life is droll. That's what, what's her name?
00:59:41 Kill La Kill always says.
00:59:43 Kill La Kill is a thing
00:59:45 that people, I think
00:59:47 seem as like not deep.
00:59:49 Yeah. Yeah.
00:59:51 It's legitimately too deep for most
00:59:53 of the people who watch it. I walked away from Kill La Kill
00:59:55 after seeing it, feeling like I had seen
00:59:57 something that was very complex
00:59:59 and had a lot to say.
01:00:01 And then I go online and everyone's like
01:00:03 not surprisingly
01:00:05 but still
01:00:07 disappointingly. There's a chart,
01:00:09 dude. This made me so mad because
01:00:11 there's this chart that's like an intro to
01:00:13 anime, intro to recommendations
01:00:15 and the guy clearly
01:00:17 knows his stuff in terms of what shows are good.
01:00:19 It's a great recommendation chart
01:00:21 but there's a part where it's in action shows
01:00:23 and it's like, I think it goes to
01:00:25 Girl in the Gone or something that it's like, do you want this?
01:00:27 But with no depth, then it goes to Kill La Kill.
01:00:29 Get out of here.
01:00:31 Really? Dude, Kill La Kill
01:00:33 and again, legit.
01:00:35 Too deep for everyone who watches it.
01:00:37 I know that the stuff that's in it
01:00:39 is there on purpose because
01:00:41 I've heard the creators talk about it
01:00:43 and I know their work and I know that they
01:00:45 fucking know shit, you know.
01:00:47 It's going back to people
01:00:49 thinking that depth
01:00:51 is equated to seriousness
01:00:53 or like big world
01:00:55 things. That's really weird to me.
01:00:57 Sorry, Ben. Go ahead.
01:00:59 I was just going to say that's really weird that people
01:01:01 think that about Kill La Kill because when I watched it
01:01:03 I felt like it was really being
01:01:05 shoved in my face that
01:01:07 this is a subversion of typical
01:01:09 anime nudity.
01:01:11 That's not even what I took out of the most
01:01:13 impressive to me.
01:01:15 I think people
01:01:17 probably write it off because of the
01:01:19 nakedness and whatever and just the
01:01:21 balls to the wall action and the scantily
01:01:23 it's so clearly saying
01:01:25 something about that stuff.
01:01:27 When Episode 3
01:01:29 rolled around and it was like Episode 3
01:01:31 is literally just stating a message about
01:01:33 the fact that she's trying to
01:01:35 use nudity as power and the
01:01:37 empowerment of being naked without shame
01:01:39 like it's literally a conversation about
01:01:41 that and then like you know there's
01:01:43 been a lot of debate over whether the way
01:01:45 the show handles that is meaningful or not
01:01:47 or if it's really, and like yeah that debate's
01:01:49 fine but then when people like
01:01:51 and that is deep but there's like a lot
01:01:53 more throughout the show you know and I
01:01:55 appreciate not getting it because
01:01:57 when I watched the show my impression
01:01:59 was I feel like there's something here
01:02:01 I'm not getting and me and Nate did a podcast
01:02:03 where me and Nate both said
01:02:05 like there's definitely something here
01:02:07 we're not getting because we were both confused
01:02:09 and I did no further research so at this
01:02:11 point I still am happy to admit I do
01:02:13 not fucking kill a kill. Whereas I
01:02:15 then like you know read some
01:02:17 shit that other people were saying about it
01:02:19 and then went to this panel where this guy like broke
01:02:21 it all down in like extensive detail and I'm like
01:02:23 holy shit like yeah this all
01:02:25 makes perfect sense and it
01:02:27 all totally is intentional
01:02:29 and it's definitely super
01:02:31 deep you know like this is some of the most
01:02:33 interesting stuff that's happened in a TV
01:02:35 series ever should remove yourselves
01:02:37 from the mindset that something
01:02:39 that's fun or sillier
01:02:41 you know can't also be complex
01:02:43 like another example
01:02:45 is Space Dandy
01:02:47 yeah I fucking
01:02:49 Space Dandy is an amazingly deep
01:02:51 show all of Watanabe's show Cowboy Bebop
01:02:53 you could say that about it's
01:02:55 the fucking it's and everyone would say Bebop
01:02:57 is deep and that's the thing though that's
01:02:59 why everyone would say Bebop is deep because
01:03:01 Bebop has moments where
01:03:03 the camera is so slowly and he looks
01:03:05 at his eyes the one's different colors because
01:03:07 it sees the future the other sees the past holy shit
01:03:09 they eat the bell peppers
01:03:11 without the beef it's bell peppers and beef without
01:03:13 the beef it's a deep
01:03:15 poverty it sinks in you know when Fe and
01:03:17 the other girls leave and the eggs are in their bowl and they start
01:03:19 eating those eggs instead of just their own
01:03:21 hey that's my analysis I did that one
01:03:23 that's a great scene
01:03:25 holy shit I love that scene so much but
01:03:27 yeah
01:03:29 but yeah like Space Dandy is
01:03:31 doing a lot of the same things just with
01:03:33 different characters who aren't obviously
01:03:35 like relatable
01:03:37 and with a layer of more silliness and stuff
01:03:39 which in no way detracts from the messages
01:03:41 underneath at all it just yeah
01:03:43 and I would also say that it's a matter of
01:03:45 like Space Dandy starts on the wrong
01:03:47 foot the first episode kind of sucks
01:03:49 and the first episode of Cowboy Bebop is fucking amazing
01:03:51 so people start up Cowboy Bebop
01:03:53 and they go this is gonna be
01:03:55 the most mind-blowing shit I ever see
01:03:57 in my life and they're proven right and
01:03:59 people start Space Dandy and they go this just
01:04:01 seems stupid and then you know seeing
01:04:03 the trailers for Space Dandy
01:04:05 and being really excited like wow this is
01:04:07 a it's gonna be like a fun like a
01:04:09 sci-fi throwback and like a flash
01:04:11 Gordon thing or a Star Trek
01:04:13 I watched the first episode and I just
01:04:15 didn't care to watch anymore for like
01:04:17 months huh yeah until I finally
01:04:19 picked it back up and then cool shit
01:04:21 started happening I mean I probably would
01:04:23 have if not for the fact that
01:04:25 it was a Watanabe show then I might
01:04:27 not have watched all of it that was my
01:04:29 whole reason to be interested and I still
01:04:31 haven't watched it but I really need to
01:04:33 but it definitely has
01:04:35 depth as it goes along and I actually
01:04:37 think that more people who watch all of
01:04:39 Space Dandy appreciate its depth
01:04:41 possibly because so many fewer people
01:04:43 have watched all of Space Dandy compared to
01:04:45 Kill La Kill but like I think
01:04:47 it is that I don't even understand
01:04:49 they seem both equally hyped to me
01:04:51 well we're all over Space Dandy's dick
01:04:53 when it was coming out a space
01:04:55 a throwback before it was out
01:04:57 yeah Space Dandy was very throwbacky
01:04:59 it was very old school I heard about
01:05:01 Kill La Kill has tits everywhere
01:05:03 that's the main reason that it's so
01:05:05 popular is that it has fucking tits everywhere
01:05:07 that's a lame reason it should be ashamed
01:05:09 well they don't they don't shove in your
01:05:11 face like a promo art I guess main characters
01:05:13 and like everyone in the
01:05:15 show like I think I think with Kill La
01:05:17 Kill it was a mixture of like
01:05:19 being a good show and also
01:05:21 being a show where there's tits
01:05:23 everywhere because everyone likes
01:05:25 shows where there's tits everywhere but no one wants
01:05:27 to admit it and if the shows are
01:05:29 usually bad so like
01:05:31 you know like a school a show like
01:05:33 high school DxD is really popular
01:05:35 because it's just
01:05:37 good enough that people can handle it
01:05:39 but then everyone's apologizes
01:05:41 for it nobody wants to admit it
01:05:43 don't they know the literal best thing
01:05:45 about that show is all the tits they shove
01:05:47 in your face and especially how the main
01:05:49 character is completely unashamed
01:05:51 he just does not give a fuck and it is
01:05:53 he's my favorite main character I've seen in 10 years
01:05:55 he's amazing he's my hero
01:05:57 I think there's a lot of people who do apologize
01:05:59 for their Kill La Kill affection
01:06:01 and I see a lot of apologies for it
01:06:03 but I think there's also
01:06:05 a lot more people who can
01:06:07 watch it and not feel that they have to
01:06:09 like they can say
01:06:11 well it's really good and of course
01:06:13 they'll explain it as
01:06:15 oh it's just good you can
01:06:17 turn your brain off sometimes
01:06:19 it's gonna offend me more than language like that
01:06:21 you know what it reminds me of
01:06:23 MLP people are just like
01:06:25 what even is this
01:06:27 there's nothing good to it
01:06:29 it's my little point there's no way it could be good
01:06:31 they just write it off because of this superficial
01:06:33 layer and do absolutely no research
01:06:35 to find out whether or not that's even close to true
01:06:37 or even worse they do research
01:06:39 and come across the fandom
01:06:41 and that makes it even more
01:06:43 I think
01:06:45 I've said this before
01:06:47 with ponies we used to say
01:06:49 anytime we criticize the show
01:06:51 people would always say it's a kids show
01:06:53 and then we'd say why are you watching it
01:06:55 if it's just a kids show
01:06:57 that's not good why are you watching it
01:06:59 because you shouldn't be
01:07:01 if that's the case
01:07:03 that's a good one
01:07:05 so my extension
01:07:07 of that to Too Deep For You
01:07:09 is if people say like
01:07:11 well sometimes you can just turn your brain off
01:07:13 and enjoy something and I would say
01:07:15 oh my god
01:07:17 if you just ignore
01:07:19 the bad parts
01:07:21 and only talk about the good parts
01:07:23 everything is a 10 out of 10
01:07:25 guys it's okay
01:07:27 you can watch anything it's all amazing
01:07:29 he nailed it
01:07:31 if you can
01:07:33 if criticizing
01:07:35 something is so wrong
01:07:37 or if all
01:07:39 art is just supposed to be fun
01:07:41 and it's not supposed to be deep
01:07:43 there's a difference just watch everything
01:07:45 it shouldn't matter anymore
01:07:47 just go for it
01:07:49 and depth can come in so many different forms
01:07:51 that it could just be
01:07:53 even if the only reason you watch a show
01:07:55 is that the character designs are good
01:07:57 the fact that the character designs are good
01:07:59 is kind of deep because
01:08:01 why are they good
01:08:03 what makes them good to you
01:08:05 why does your brain interpret them that way
01:08:07 and complexity and artistic
01:08:09 depth can come accidentally too
01:08:11 it's been a while
01:08:13 he literally
01:08:15 just wanted people
01:08:17 punching each other and going on adventures
01:08:19 but he ended up making this
01:08:21 all-encompassing
01:08:23 this saga of this character's entire life
01:08:25 and his children
01:08:27 and it's beautiful
01:08:29 depth can totally be accidental
01:08:31 and I think
01:08:33 that it probably should be
01:08:35 if you set out to make something deep
01:08:37 you're probably not making the thing you're trying to make
01:08:39 you're probably going to fail
01:08:41 I think you can
01:08:43 I don't think depth has to be
01:08:45 incidental so much as that
01:08:47 you can have an idea
01:08:49 and know it's deep and make it
01:08:51 obviously Undertale
01:08:53 Toby Fox knew it was deep
01:08:55 there's no way he thought it was just
01:08:57 some shallow
01:08:59 I just made this thing
01:09:01 that comments on the nature of the medium
01:09:03 and has everything to do with everything
01:09:05 people would think it was deep
01:09:07 he knew it had
01:09:09 qualities but didn't know
01:09:11 wasn't prepared to say
01:09:13 I don't think that he set out
01:09:15 I think what Ben is really trying to say is
01:09:17 I don't think you should set out to make something deep
01:09:19 but if the idea you have is deep
01:09:21 then whatever
01:09:23 run with it
01:09:25 he surely knew it was deep
01:09:27 but I don't think his goal was make a deep game
01:09:29 I agree with that
01:09:31 well
01:09:33 does anybody want to give any more examples
01:09:35 to wrap it up to did Ben
01:09:37 do you want to give an example of a thing
01:09:39 no
01:09:41 wait what about that comic I read recently
01:09:43 that was really great
01:09:45 the vapors
01:09:47 I don't know
01:09:49 is that something that I can support on Patreon
01:09:51 as a matter of fact
01:09:53 it is Jesse
01:09:55 just go to patreon.com
01:09:57 throw a couple of bucks the creators way
01:09:59 he's a real deep guy
01:10:01 I don't know about you guys but I'm going to go do that
01:10:03 before this video ends
01:10:05 I got to run
01:10:07 not walk to that Patreon page
01:10:09 I love
01:10:11 to get back to the topic at hand
01:10:13 I run into stuff all the time
01:10:15 that is like too deep for me
01:10:17 and
01:10:19 it's always like that
01:10:21 battle of like on the one hand
01:10:23 I really in fact I would say
01:10:25 all video games are too deep for me
01:10:27 all of them
01:10:29 all video games
01:10:31 because
01:10:33 all video games
01:10:35 you know what all of them
01:10:37 most of the games I beat
01:10:39 in the last 15 years
01:10:41 were like
01:10:43 6 hour action games
01:10:45 games like Devil May Cry
01:10:47 or fucking vanquish
01:10:49 or platinum games and stuff like that
01:10:51 but I always just played through them on normal mode
01:10:53 in 6 hours
01:10:55 and then never again
01:10:57 and like
01:10:59 what do you do with those
01:11:01 I know that there's way more depth to those games
01:11:03 if you replay them and get to the highest
01:11:05 because most of those games like
01:11:07 are made really with the highest difficulty in mind
01:11:09 if you play something like
01:11:11 Metal Gear Rising Revengeance
01:11:13 or Metal Gear Solid 3
01:11:15 or any of the Metal Gear Solid games
01:11:17 but like 3 most especially
01:11:19 the level of complexity
01:11:21 and depth of high level play
01:11:23 is so much different from low level play
01:11:25 that's basically another game
01:11:27 about what you can be forced to do
01:11:29 by the difficulty increasing
01:11:31 and how it makes you be creative and explore the game more
01:11:33 and I think that
01:11:35 most mainstream
01:11:37 critics of games engage
01:11:39 about 50% of the depth
01:11:41 of the game
01:11:43 maybe close to the 75%
01:11:45 depending on the game
01:11:47 that's the thing though
01:11:49 I think the reason that a game like Bioshock Infinite
01:11:51 gets so much critical praise
01:11:53 is that you don't have to play it again
01:11:55 you appreciate the depth
01:11:57 you do not have to play Bioshock Infinite twice
01:11:59 at all
01:12:01 I played it on the highest difficulty
01:12:03 because it's so fucking easy
01:12:05 and the combat is so terrible
01:12:07 that I played it on the highest difficulty
01:12:09 and fucking had a breeze with it
01:12:11 and there was nothing else that I felt like I was missing
01:12:13 there's little recursive hints
01:12:15 like maybe you'll get a little more out of the story
01:12:17 if you play it a second time
01:12:19 but I don't think it's anywhere near the level
01:12:21 of Metal Gear Solid 3
01:12:23 I think the systems of the game to play it on the highest difficulty
01:12:25 compared to normal mode
01:12:27 and that's why reviews are often times
01:12:29 not really very great ways to judge
01:12:31 the content of a game
01:12:33 that's why you need someone like Super Bunnyhop
01:12:35 who will beat that motherfucker up
01:12:37 he will smash the pussy of that shit until it no longer works
01:12:39 to tell you how it works
01:12:41 it's interesting though
01:12:43 that you bring that up
01:12:45 that a game could be reviewed well
01:12:47 because it is shallow enough
01:12:49 to be easily died
01:12:51 to the reviewing circle
01:12:53 is what they're going to advocate for
01:12:55 it plays well in the format that reviewers play
01:12:57 which is usually
01:12:59 at like a hotel somewhere
01:13:01 because they've been invited to a review event
01:13:03 or a fucking corporate event where they're surrounded by staffers
01:13:05 telling them how to play the game
01:13:07 and I love Bunnyhop
01:13:09 especially because and I was saying this
01:13:11 about the Fallout 4 review
01:13:13 and we had a little debate about this
01:13:15 maybe even in the best game ever podcast
01:13:17 where I was saying how like
01:13:19 this game is not that good
01:13:21 right now
01:13:23 the depth of this game will really be
01:13:25 explored once people start modding it
01:13:27 and turning it into something different
01:13:29 and then we'll suddenly have
01:13:31 probably a much better game on our hands
01:13:33 and I wish more reviewers
01:13:35 would write like that
01:13:37 would write like
01:13:39 this review is based on
01:13:41 I played this many hours of the game
01:13:43 this is how like all those fucking phantom pain reviews
01:13:45 that gave the game a 10 out of 10
01:13:47 and it's like did you really make it
01:13:49 did you really play the fucking
01:13:51 like what 90 hours it takes
01:13:53 to beat this fucker
01:13:55 because I don't think you did
01:13:57 I think you probably made it to the first ending
01:13:59 and went okay it was 10 out of 10
01:14:01 I didn't get bored with it because I only played it
01:14:03 for fucking three days and I didn't realize how much
01:14:05 like you know
01:14:07 bullshit there is but then again
01:14:09 if you do go beyond the impossible like Bunnyhop did
01:14:11 beat it to 100% completion
01:14:13 and found all kinds of unique things
01:14:15 that even people who played it
01:14:17 to the end you know who people like you guys
01:14:19 were just like oh fuck this game
01:14:21 it sucks you know like
01:14:23 he found all kinds of other shit
01:14:25 to like about it and came out with the sort of
01:14:27 you know and I'm not saying like reviewers
01:14:29 shouldn't review games on that level of
01:14:31 engagement because I think most people play games
01:14:33 on that level of engagement
01:14:35 games are too deep for most people
01:14:37 most people won't go all the way through
01:14:39 most people never see Ash Lake in Dark Souls
01:14:41 in the same way we need
01:14:43 different games for different people
01:14:45 we kind of need different reviewers for different people
01:14:47 and that's why George Weidman is so valuable
01:14:49 not only is he he's a real
01:14:51 real modern journalist
01:14:53 he does it the way that
01:14:55 that technology allows it to be done now
01:14:57 much better than
01:14:59 going to one of these fucking events and like
01:15:01 playing it for 10 hours or whatever
01:15:03 and like he plays it in the way that I play
01:15:05 games personally in fact he goes beyond what I need
01:15:07 but the thoroughness
01:15:09 is so welcome and so rich
01:15:11 I would love it if every reviewer
01:15:13 like if where they have all those stats
01:15:15 on like game stuff or whatever
01:15:17 game spot where they have like the little like
01:15:19 notations on the side or if it said like
01:15:21 how many hours I spent
01:15:23 playing it how many
01:15:25 you know like how many times I beat it
01:15:27 what difficulty I beat it on because you know
01:15:29 those are so important
01:15:31 super relevant and I love Yahtzee
01:15:33 who I respect him so much because
01:15:35 he does that in all of his review he'll tell you
01:15:37 like I only play games on medium
01:15:39 I expect them to be that I only play them
01:15:41 for a week because I have to do a show
01:15:43 you know like if I return to a game I'll probably
01:15:45 talk about it on a different show not my review
01:15:47 show he's admitted when he played
01:15:49 Final Fantasy 13 he was like this game's not for me
01:15:51 I played 10 hours and I'm fucking sick of it
01:15:53 I'm too busy
01:15:55 half of his review was about how he was opening up the
01:15:57 mana bar and therefore he couldn't
01:15:59 find time to play the game you know because
01:16:01 he didn't care about it like that says something
01:16:03 about it yeah like that's and
01:16:05 and like for me those reviews are
01:16:07 perfect because that's how I play most games
01:16:09 you know and I go okay Yahtzee I'm
01:16:11 I'm with you I also don't want to spend
01:16:13 30 hours waiting for this game to get good
01:16:15 you know but it doesn't get good after 30
01:16:17 hours let's be clear but yeah
01:16:19 but like you know
01:16:21 for other people there are and
01:16:23 and you know I think I think those reviews
01:16:25 are out there they're just very decentralized
01:16:27 right right game stop is not or game
01:16:29 spot or whatever it's not the ones making
01:16:31 those reviews if you go to like rpgamer
01:16:33 or something you'll find the guy who writes
01:16:35 that review you know I think I think it's
01:16:37 just a matter of like people should go out
01:16:39 and find the reviews that actually reflect
01:16:41 the way they play games right right
01:16:43 this is we've gotten off top we're completely
01:16:45 my point is that video games are too deep
01:16:47 for me because I never beat them to that level
01:16:49 of completion right
01:16:51 okay that's covers everybody we've all
01:16:53 told the story that this was
01:16:55 excellent discussion this was everything
01:16:57 I hoped it would be about the subject
01:16:59 anybody have any any other last thoughts
01:17:01 they want to put in
01:17:03 my dick
01:17:05 I think we all were thinking
01:17:07 that yeah the only one who said I mean
01:17:09 let's let's be at the end of the day what's the thing
01:17:11 that's too deep for anyone my dick
01:17:13 way too fucking deep
01:17:15 all right my dick runs deep
01:17:17 so deep put her ass to sleep
01:17:21 cutting off that blood flow in all the right
01:17:23 ways all right guys
