00:00:00 Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemail for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Radcon funded by you. We can be Pro Crastinators.
00:00:18 Hello. It's the amazing Atheist here. What does he sound like?
00:00:26 It's about, right? It's like, well, you know.
00:00:30 It's TJ here and I just, you know, video games are okay. It's okay to be bad at video games, women.
00:00:40 I'll still date you.
00:00:42 Maybe he talks about video games.
00:00:44 He must mention them. He must mention them occasionally.
00:00:48 I don't think he's a gamer. I think he...
00:00:51 Come on. Maybe he's played Fallout New Vegas or something.
00:00:54 I genuinely don't remember. I mean, was he involved in Gamergate at all?
00:01:03 He must have talked about it in some capacity.
00:01:06 Oh, he definitely talked about it. I can't remember his content from back then.
00:01:12 He's sort of, he's strange. He was like anti SJW to a point and then sort of turned into like a leftist more recently.
00:01:23 He's friends with Lush and stuff. He's always been like pro the people and fuck the police.
00:01:30 And it just so happens that at the time it was like...
00:01:36 He's like even more milk toast than like shoe on head now.
00:01:40 Yeah. Well, I don't actually know. I don't watch his stuff too much.
00:01:44 I just see him on Twitter. I don't know. Whatever.
00:01:48 I was gonna do hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I was like, no, no, that's old. That's old hat.
00:01:55 We've all heard that before. What's someone else?
00:01:58 No, no, but we gotta go back though, you know.
00:02:00 You're right.
00:02:01 You're right. We have to...
00:02:02 I'm the Nostalgia Critic.
00:02:04 You're one might say we have to go back to the past.
00:02:07 I remember the past so you don't have to.
00:02:11 I have. So you don't have to the past.
00:02:14 Man, did you... You saw my tweet, right? You saw my tweet about...
00:02:18 Yeah, the chin. His fucking beard.
00:02:23 His goatee that is slid like it's wispy on his chin, but it's like more built up on his neck underneath his chin.
00:02:30 That picture that I tweeted, it's usually like... That one, it's like particularly short.
00:02:36 I think that picture is from... I think it's from To Boldly Flea. It's from one of the movies, but yeah.
00:02:43 He always... It's consistent. I think it... I'm not sure if he thinks...
00:02:49 Well, I think he thinks it looks good. I don't think it's supposed to be like,
00:02:54 I made my character look bad on purpose or anything.
00:02:57 But he consistently... When he's the critic, he consistently cuts his beard that way.
00:03:03 And the goatee extends like down under the chin, like onto the neck.
00:03:09 And I don't know if it's an attempt at like sculpting a face shape.
00:03:13 I mean, you can tell if he shaves around that area. Like he deliberately makes it that shape.
00:03:19 Yeah. Yeah.
00:03:20 I was confused because I had not noticed that. I googled image like nostalgia critic or Doug Walker.
00:03:26 And I couldn't see an angle where that was as prevalent as the one you posted.
00:03:30 Yeah. Yeah. You can't see it in Google Images because all the Google Images pictures are like head-on.
00:03:35 You can't see it head-on. You have to see it from the side or slightly underneath.
00:03:39 And then you can't... You can't miss it.
00:03:43 Hold on. It was... This was...
00:03:47 I'm only looking at my discord because someone posted a retrospective...
00:03:55 Oh, yes. Jess from my server posted a retrospective from a YouTuber called DireGentlemen.
00:04:06 That is a... Dan Olsen did his thing about the wall pretty recently.
00:04:11 And then a little after that, DireGentlemen posted this thing about the review must go on, which I didn't even know existed.
00:04:18 Do you know what that is?
00:04:20 Mulan Rouge review, wasn't it?
00:04:23 No.
00:04:24 I've seen a lot of his stuff.
00:04:27 No. The review must go on is... I'm going to recap.
00:04:30 There's a bunch of retrospectives on this specific topic, which I've watched like three of them like yesterday.
00:04:36 I just think they're so funny.
00:04:37 Was it just like about the drama?
00:04:40 No. It's more specific even than that. It's about when he did...
00:04:46 Was Toboldly Flea the one where he kills the critic?
00:04:49 Yes. That was the last canonical big stupid movie.
00:04:54 Yeah. They did Toboldly Flea, killed the critic, and then this was an attempt at sort of jumping...
00:05:04 Yig Studio style, changing the channel to making content that nobody wanted in the form of...
00:05:11 He started a new series called Demo Reel.
00:05:17 And he did two episodes of it. Nobody liked it.
00:05:24 Mike Michaud, the guy that owns his character, was like, you got to go back to the thing that makes me money, dude, right now, or I'll kill you.
00:05:33 And he said, fuck.
00:05:34 So then in defeat, Revue Must Go On is basically the finale to Demo Reel, in which it is a post.
00:05:44 It is sort of a retroactively decided that actually Demo Reel was only like a fantasy in the mind of the critic.
00:05:56 And like the demonic spirit of the critic visits the main character of Demo Reel and tells him like, you're fake.
00:06:03 I am what's real. Bring me back. You must do it. And Doug says, no.
00:06:08 No, I hate reviewing movies.
00:06:11 It's so dramatic. And he does the face. He does the dreamworks face so much to be like badass.
00:06:17 I don't remember that video now that I think about it.
00:06:20 But it's...
00:06:21 But when like...
00:06:22 Oh, it's a fake out. The nostalgia critic's back. Oh my God.
00:06:26 But it's really, it's really clear.
00:06:29 It was actually based at the time.
00:06:32 I mean, there were definitely things to say about it.
00:06:35 I can't remember. I think I must have been, I think I must have been excited at the time because I was still a fan of his.
00:06:42 I mean, if you wanted to see more critic, if you wanted to see more critic than I'm sure you were like, yes, he's bringing it back.
00:06:50 Yes.
00:06:51 But...
00:06:52 A pog.
00:06:53 But when you really think about it and this, I'm sort of spoiling, I'm doing the opposite of burying the lead.
00:07:00 I'm kind of digging up the lead and spoiling it.
00:07:03 But like, basically the thesis of this video and it's, it's, it seems other videos have had the same thesis.
00:07:11 It's like, when you hear how he talked about it at the time, it's really clear that he wanted to move away from the critic and start making original content
00:07:20 and failed so spectacularly that, that demo reel and the review must go on is basically a huge, it's just a huge cope in which he on screen sort of grapples with
00:07:32 and like in real time sort of convinces himself that, no, I actually really wanted to do the critic the whole time all along.
00:07:43 That was just burnout.
00:07:44 I mean, it could be kind of half true.
00:07:48 I mean, the demo reel from what I remember hearing about it was just like the sorts of skits he would put in Nostalgia Critic but without the movie review aspect of it.
00:07:56 So like, what if we just had a skit about like Batman doing something and I was Batman.
00:08:01 I went, haha.
00:08:02 Like that, that's the extent of like the intellectual content of demo reel.
00:08:07 And so it's like, well, as long as I can do that while I do reviews, then I can do Nostalgia Critic again.
00:08:12 And that's what he's been doing.
00:08:15 Yeah.
00:08:16 Terrible skits with actors dressing up in silly bad costumes on shitty green screens acting out things from the movie so they could say, ah, it's not very good, is it?
00:08:28 I see those other people in his stuff, like all those other people that are in like the wall review and I'm like, what's their story?
00:08:42 Like, what do they think about all this?
00:08:44 Like the post scandal, like new crop of people who are all there and all sort of really look the same.
00:08:51 I think, well, I remember that there was a lady who was there for like a few episodes of Nostalgia Critic.
00:08:59 Nostalgia Critic was like, okay, I'm ending Nostalgia Critic, I'm going to start a new show, we're going to get a studio, we're going to get actors, we're going to do skits about fucking movies or whatever.
00:09:09 He hired, I don't know their names, he hired the black guy and then a lady.
00:09:15 I know the black guy's name is Malcolm and that's the only one whose name I know.
00:09:19 Malcolm, yes.
00:09:20 He's a staple, I think he generally likes it but he seems more of a normal human being, so he gets paid so why not?
00:09:29 That guy seems like a freaking nerd, that guy's got big dweeb energy.
00:09:36 A big old fucking dork on screen every time I see him, I want to shove him in a locker if you ask me.
00:09:44 Yeah, go on.
00:09:46 True, true.
00:09:48 She left and to like go and do real acting work, she had like a goodbye video.
00:09:54 It's like, yeah, I'm going to move on to like a brighter future because it was so obvious that she was like, I don't want to be stuck working under the Nostalgia Critic.
00:10:05 I'm trying to get an acting career going, so I'm gone and then there was a new lady.
00:10:10 This was a lady who was on like three episodes of Nostalgia Critic, he said.
00:10:15 She was on, I think she was on Demoreal and then on like a few episodes of Nostalgia Critic, maybe for one, maybe for a year.
00:10:22 I can't remember exactly and then she left and then there was the new lady, the shorter one.
00:10:27 She's been there for years afterwards.
00:10:32 This was pre-scandal or post-scandal?
00:10:36 I think this was pre-scandal, the not so awesome document, yeah.
00:10:41 Definitely pre-scandal, I think she was just like, oh god, this sucks.
00:10:46 I kind of want a different acting job and thank fuck, I found something, I'm gone.
00:10:51 Goodbye.
00:10:54 It's not the Dire Gentleman video, there's another video that he links by a YouTuber called LadyEmily,
00:11:03 called the Failure of Channel Awesome's Demoreal, that is more specifically in depth about what the series is.
00:11:10 There's a part where the lady in Demoreal goes on what seems to be a sort of improvised and presumably heartfelt rant
00:11:20 about how people don't take women in acting seriously and how it bothers her.
00:11:31 And so I can believe that maybe this was someone who was really serious about acting,
00:11:38 who Doug picked up from a, I don't know, a casting call service or something,
00:11:45 and maybe she was getting started and then after a while she was like,
00:11:50 this isn't the legit gig I was looking for when I signed up for this, I've had enough.
00:11:57 Which does make it curious why Malcolm is still there after all this time.
00:12:01 Could he not escape or did he actually enjoy it? That's the question.
00:12:06 I mean, I've heard people say that Malcolm is pretty much just like a normie,
00:12:11 like I don't think Malcolm is like an aspiring actor or anything, like he's just a guy.
00:12:16 I've heard he's a furry too.
00:12:19 No, it was, we talked about Fena and The Wall Review last week
00:12:23 and then I think it was Discount Gumshoe and my server was talking about it
00:12:28 and people were saying that the word on the street is that Malcolm is a furry
00:12:33 and that Doug probably knew about Fena from Malcolm.
00:12:36 That's like, people think that's the connection there and I don't know.
00:12:42 This is just what I hear.
00:12:44 How embarrassing, it's true.
00:12:47 I mean, well, I don't know.
00:12:50 I mean, he'd have to hear about it.
00:12:52 Imagine knowing Fena.
00:12:54 Oh, yeah, I mean, sure.
00:12:57 I mean, yeah, I'd never heard of this person before The Wall.
00:13:02 I wonder what Fena thinks about, like I wonder if being in The Wall Review
00:13:06 has been like a net positive?
00:13:08 Because like, I'm sure that tons of people would never have known about Fena.
00:13:13 I don't know, like there's a niche that surely would have known
00:13:18 but I'm sure there's a whole new audience that is aware of it.
00:13:22 But I think that like the number of people who, of all the people who learned of Fena
00:13:27 from The Wall Review, most people probably hate it.
00:13:31 I mean, they're...
00:13:34 I mean, you were talking about the Nostalgia Critic fan base,
00:13:38 like the people who actually watch every video and enjoy them.
00:13:40 But The Wall Review transcended just the fan base.
00:13:44 Like The Wall Review made it a wider impact than that.
00:13:48 That was largely not good, you know?
00:13:51 Yes, absolutely.
00:13:53 But like of the Nostalgia Critic fan base,
00:13:55 I think more of them than less of them would have like seen Fena
00:14:01 and been like, ah, interesting.
00:14:03 Maybe so.
00:14:04 Maybe going to check them out.
00:14:06 I wonder if the kind of person who's still like an unironic
00:14:11 that guy with a glasses fan in, you know...
00:14:14 God, when did that The Wall Review drop out?
00:14:17 No, it's older than that, right?
00:14:19 I think it was 2020.
00:14:21 Well, let me check.
00:14:23 Wait, this is crazy.
00:14:25 That's crazy.
00:14:27 Maybe it was 2019.
00:14:29 Oh no, it was September 2019.
00:14:31 Okay.
00:14:32 I mean, I wonder if the kind of person who's still an unironic
00:14:35 that guy with a glasses fan in 2019,
00:14:39 like is that Fena's demographic?
00:14:41 Like, is there already crossover there?
00:14:43 I don't know.
00:14:44 I just don't know.
00:14:45 He talks about satellite city in The Wall Review
00:14:49 as though it's just expected that you know what that is.
00:14:53 So, I mean, I don't know.
00:14:59 Maybe they had already cross-pollinated and there was no...
00:15:03 It could be that everyone who knew Doug already knew Fena
00:15:07 for whatever reason.
00:15:09 And only the haters now are learned of it through that.
00:15:16 God, it's so funny.
00:15:18 People with no self-awareness are so funny.
00:15:20 I'm so glad.
00:15:22 I'm so thankful for people like Doug.
00:15:26 It's always been a little weird,
00:15:28 because I don't think Doug is totally not self-aware,
00:15:31 but he does continue the show and the character
00:15:34 that he does all this stuff.
00:15:36 He's not 100% not self-aware.
00:15:40 He's like the character of the critic
00:15:44 is an exaggerated version of himself,
00:15:46 but himself is still kind of a weird guy
00:15:49 and that doesn't realize how awkward he sounds
00:15:51 in vlogs where he's talking normally.
00:15:55 He's sort of like,
00:15:56 that's sort of a cringy nerd kind of person,
00:15:58 but I don't know.
00:16:00 There's something about Doug
00:16:05 when he's like...
00:16:08 It would be hard to think of...
00:16:10 If I listened to Doug talk in any of his videos
00:16:13 for more than a few minutes, it always happens.
00:16:16 It consistently happens.
00:16:18 The one that's coming to mind is...
00:16:21 It's the Wall Review when he describes...
00:16:25 When he's like, quote,
00:16:27 the movie ends on such an open vagueness.
00:16:30 It's like a weird way of constructing that sentence
00:16:33 that's like, you know what he means,
00:16:35 but it's not quite right.
00:16:37 And it's just the way that someone who's not very smart talks.
00:16:41 It's like, he doesn't quite...
00:16:43 He just doesn't quite like value...
00:16:48 Language enough to respect its rules.
00:16:51 And this is a script.
00:16:53 It's not like he's going off the cuff
00:16:55 and speaking off the cuff and that just came out.
00:16:57 He wrote that down in a script
00:17:00 and then delivered the line deliberately.
00:17:02 That's what he thought he should say.
00:17:04 It's an obvious...
00:17:06 He was there first,
00:17:08 so his clout is mostly luck-based.
00:17:11 Sure.
00:17:12 He built...
00:17:14 And then since he's got an audience,
00:17:16 it's like the amount of effort he needs to put in
00:17:20 didn't ever really need to increase.
00:17:22 Yeah.
00:17:23 Because he got such an early big audience
00:17:25 that as long as I'm wacky,
00:17:27 then it'll work.
00:17:28 It doesn't need to be smart, really.
00:17:30 Just like the Procrastinators podcast.
00:17:33 I tell ya.
00:17:34 I tell ya.
00:17:35 We got our fans.
00:17:37 Our expectations have been set so low.
00:17:40 The bar is so low.
00:17:41 These piggies will just keep turning up every week
00:17:45 and eat more slop from the trough.
00:17:48 Got them.
00:17:50 There's nothing you can do.
00:17:52 Hey, when it works, it works.
00:17:54 It's free.
00:17:55 It's just free.
00:17:57 Rent-free.
00:17:58 Rent-free, am I right?
00:18:00 We upload to YouTube rent-free.
00:18:02 I don't know what that means.
00:18:04 I mean, we're in their heads rent-free.
00:18:07 I mean, they think to themselves,
00:18:11 God, what are those guys going to talk about?
00:18:14 They think to themselves, oh, God.
00:18:17 What is this fucking show?
00:18:20 It sucks.
00:18:21 I don't like any of it.
00:18:22 God, it's so bad.
00:18:23 Clicks on your video.
00:18:25 Rent-free.
00:18:26 Rent-free.
00:18:35 We think PZP.
00:18:37 More like Pussy.
00:18:41 They say it.
00:18:42 They say it to their friends, and they tell their friends,
00:18:45 and that's how words spread.
00:18:47 Oh, God.
00:18:49 You don't want to listen to this podcast.
00:18:51 It's bad.
00:18:52 It sucks.
00:18:54 That's right, but that's just how we get it.
00:18:58 We're so bad that you can't shake it,
00:19:01 that you just can't stop.
00:19:03 God, I heard like five seconds of that one podcast,
00:19:07 and I just keep thinking about how annoying it was,
00:19:10 how annoying.
00:19:11 This is called the PZP?
00:19:12 I got a complaint about it.
00:19:14 Hey, make an angry review of our podcast.
00:19:17 Make a video talking about the fall of the PZP,
00:19:20 and about how it's bad now.
00:19:23 It used to be good, but it's bad now.
00:19:26 And then post it on Reddit.
00:19:30 There are people, I forgot we have a subreddit.
00:19:35 I also never ever check it, but yes.
00:19:38 I used to look at it occasionally,
00:19:40 and then the other day, someone linked me one of the,
00:19:44 it was tectonic improv, actually.
00:19:47 He wanted to mention something to me,
00:19:51 and to illustrate his point,
00:19:53 he linked me to a thread on the PZP Discord server,
00:19:57 and I was like, oh, my God, that's right.
00:19:59 We have one of those.
00:20:01 Is it r slash the pro...
00:20:03 r slash the pro...
00:20:07 Yes, it's r slash the pro procrastinators.
00:20:10 Still somewhat active, believe it or not.
00:20:14 Unbelievable.
00:20:17 Wait.
00:20:20 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:20:22 New threads every few days.
00:20:25 There they go.
00:20:27 There they freaking go.
00:20:29 I'm actually...
00:20:31 Shit.
00:20:33 We could read this on stream.
00:20:36 I mean, there's not...
00:20:38 Someone asked, Ben, Davoo, and Trixie,
00:20:41 parentheses did you used to live together, right?
00:20:44 Uh, yes.
00:20:47 Steve, Steve Nuge, the answer is yes.
00:20:51 Um...
00:20:54 Is anyone, is anyone, is anyone subbed
00:20:58 to best guy ever's Patreon?
00:21:00 Does he go into detail about the recent PZP
00:21:02 Canton situations in his solo podcast?
00:21:04 Uh, I don't know.
00:21:06 Okay, this isn't...
00:21:08 This is actually not...
00:21:10 This is all stuff that you could know.
00:21:13 If you just listened to our four hour podcast
00:21:15 where we answer voicemails for two and a half hours,
00:21:18 it would be easy.
00:21:20 There'd be no need.
00:21:22 There'd be no need to suffer through the wasteland
00:21:25 that is r slash the pro procrastinators.
00:21:27 But, I mean, you do you, I guess.
00:21:30 Yeah.
00:21:33 Oh, and I'm a moderator.
00:21:35 That's cool.
00:21:37 You know, speaking of our crumbling, dying show
00:21:41 where we are in the grave,
00:21:43 both feet in the grave, hands in the grave,
00:21:46 only our mouths are sticking out of the ground
00:21:49 and that's how we're talking.
00:21:51 Sucking air, yeah, sucking air and talking a little bit.
00:21:54 I am a little bad in medical ways.
00:22:01 I'm okay for this show.
00:22:03 Yeah, you're still sick, huh?
00:22:05 Yeah, the fact that I'm still sick is the problem.
00:22:08 I'm going to the hospital tomorrow morning
00:22:11 with like a...
00:22:13 I printed out a list of like tests that a doctor said,
00:22:16 you should get these tests done
00:22:18 just to make sure we know what is going on with you
00:22:20 because this shouldn't have been going on for so long.
00:22:23 Because I had, I'd gone to the hospital already.
00:22:26 I'd taken medicine for the thing
00:22:28 and it hasn't cleared up.
00:22:30 So, if this is maybe the last time you'll ever hear
00:22:35 on the internet, I'll die in fact.
00:22:38 No, no, no.
00:22:41 No, no, I wouldn't...
00:22:43 If I was actually dying...
00:22:45 I don't know, I think the worst thing it could be
00:22:48 is like diabetes out of nowhere.
00:22:52 Diabetes?
00:22:54 Because I've been like dehydrated
00:22:56 and being unable to keep water,
00:22:59 getting into my body no matter how much I drink.
00:23:01 That feels like...
00:23:02 Is that a diabetes thing?
00:23:04 That's a diabetes thing.
00:23:06 It's like a kidney thing.
00:23:07 I've been looking up a lot of things.
00:23:08 It's like, what is exactly going on with me?
00:23:11 It's basically been the last week.
00:23:13 It's like...
00:23:15 I got...
00:23:17 It sucks.
00:23:18 It sucks, but it's all been on my mind.
00:23:22 I don't want to get too scared
00:23:25 because you know how it is.
00:23:26 You look on medical sites, you say,
00:23:28 so I have this one thing.
00:23:30 The worst possible things it could be are at the top.
00:23:33 You look up...
00:23:35 My tongue's kind of itchy.
00:23:37 You go on WebMD and it's like...
00:23:40 Tongue cancer.
00:23:41 Brain cancer.
00:23:42 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:23:44 So, I've narrowed it down to a few things it could be,
00:23:49 but I'm obviously not a professional,
00:23:51 so I'm just going to go to the hospital,
00:23:54 say, please figure out what's wrong with me.
00:23:58 I don't know what to do, and then they'll go, okay.
00:24:01 So, are you just dehydrated all the time
00:24:04 and that's the issue?
00:24:06 Kind of, but it's like a gastrointestinal something or other.
00:24:13 There's maybe something wrong with my kidney.
00:24:15 There's something causing the dehydration.
00:24:17 I don't know whether that's linked to whatever's happening
00:24:19 with my kidney.
00:24:20 I don't even know whether my kidney is involved.
00:24:22 Dehydration causes kidney problem because if you're dehydrated,
00:24:27 your kidney has no...
00:24:29 It gets fucked up because it needs...
00:24:34 Your kidney has to filter your blood or whatever
00:24:37 and dehydration makes it less dilute,
00:24:39 which makes it more concentrated
00:24:41 in whatever bullshit it's got to do.
00:24:43 Yeah, the thing with diabetes, I skimmed it,
00:24:46 so I'm not entirely sure.
00:24:47 I couldn't recite what is diabetes,
00:24:49 but I think what it is is the water goes straight through you
00:24:52 without getting absorbed into the body
00:24:54 because the kidney is trying and failing
00:24:57 to do something with the blood sugar level,
00:24:59 and so it thinks, oh, I've got to flush something out.
00:25:02 There's too much sugar here.
00:25:03 I've got to flush it out.
00:25:04 You go to the toilet more often,
00:25:06 but the water doesn't stay in you,
00:25:08 so you don't get hydrated even if you drink
00:25:10 like more than two liters of water a day.
00:25:12 And that's what's been happening.
00:25:14 I'm dehydrated right now as I'm drinking.
00:25:17 It sucks.
00:25:18 I don't know what to do about it.
00:25:21 Do you take like a multivitamin or anything?
00:25:26 I take the multivitamin tablet thing a couple times.
00:25:31 Maybe I could take one out a day.
00:25:33 A couple times.
00:25:34 I don't know.
00:25:35 Well, I don't know how bad or good it was doing.
00:25:39 Maybe I should just be doing it anyway.
00:25:41 I mean, I feel like almost everyone
00:25:44 should take multivitamins.
00:25:47 There's basically almost no reason not to.
00:25:52 I guess what I was thinking is I didn't want to...
00:25:58 Multivitamins, they say on them is like,
00:26:00 it's not a food substitute.
00:26:02 It's like to go with food.
00:26:04 If I eat the right food,
00:26:06 it should actually clear up the problem.
00:26:09 If I just take multivitamins all the time,
00:26:11 I might be just sort of delaying something
00:26:14 instead of actually fixing anything.
00:26:16 And so I've been trying to eat better.
00:26:18 I've been cooking spinach and whatever.
00:26:21 Sure.
00:26:22 But if you're like, maybe before,
00:26:25 maybe you were eating bad
00:26:27 and you were getting 25% of the vitamins you could be getting,
00:26:31 but then you're like, I'm going to eat better.
00:26:33 And then it's like, okay, now I'm getting 75%.
00:26:36 It's like, okay, great.
00:26:37 But if you take the multivitamin,
00:26:39 then that's guaranteed 100%.
00:26:42 So why not?
00:26:43 I guess I should take it.
00:26:45 I mean, I'm not sure what the correlation,
00:26:48 the link between the vitamins and the dehydration would be.
00:26:54 I feel like vitamin deficiency
00:26:58 might result in not being able to retain water.
00:27:01 I don't know.
00:27:02 I could be wrong.
00:27:03 Yeah.
00:27:04 There's such a thing as being pre-diabetic,
00:27:08 which is like you're not actually diabetic,
00:27:10 but you're like at risk of it.
00:27:12 So I don't know.
00:27:13 It's probably good to find out sooner.
00:27:15 So maybe if you're in some stage of pre-diabetes,
00:27:19 something can be done about it.
00:27:21 It would be a shame if you let it sit
00:27:24 and you just became diabetic when you didn't have to.
00:27:26 Yeah, that's why I'm going to go to the hospital.
00:27:28 But that's basically the reason why
00:27:30 I don't have anything to talk about this week
00:27:32 is because basically every day it's just been like,
00:27:35 oh, I'm still ill.
00:27:36 God, I've got to do something about that.
00:27:39 Oh, jeez, I'm so weak.
00:27:40 I feel like I can't move.
00:27:42 I can barely do stuff.
00:27:45 Oh, I did something, but it's like 6 p.m.
00:27:48 Maybe I should call a doctor.
00:27:50 Oh, jeez, Rick.
00:27:52 Oh, boy.
00:27:55 And that's been it.
00:27:56 That's all I've been trying to do.
00:27:58 I'm just trying to exist.
00:27:59 I mean, I've been procrastinating
00:28:03 on making that dentist appointment.
00:28:05 I've been saying for a long time,
00:28:06 I've got to go to the dentist.
00:28:08 I got cavities.
00:28:09 I know I got to get them drilled.
00:28:12 I would like to get a whitening or something on my teeth.
00:28:16 My teeth are looking a little dingy.
00:28:18 I want to go to the dentist.
00:28:19 And the last time I saw my parents, my mom,
00:28:22 my sweet old mom was like,
00:28:27 oh, here's some, don't tell your father
00:28:29 I'm giving you this money.
00:28:31 I'm giving you some money for a dentist appointment.
00:28:34 Don't forget to schedule your dentist appointment.
00:28:37 I said, thanks, mom, and I haven't done it.
00:28:40 And I got these several $20 bills
00:28:44 that she handed me sitting in my desk drawer
00:28:46 that I promised I would use to get a dentist appointment.
00:28:50 And I haven't done it yet.
00:28:52 I promise I'm going to do it.
00:28:53 I swear, but I'm lazy.
00:28:58 And I have been, I know I keep saying this.
00:29:03 I know I keep saying this,
00:29:04 but I have been, I really am in the final stretches
00:29:07 of working on the secret project.
00:29:09 It is like, I wish I could say what I've been doing with it,
00:29:14 but that would be given the game away.
00:29:15 I'm not ready to give the game away quite yet,
00:29:17 but I am like, I'm on the cusp.
00:29:20 I'm on the cusp and I've been like,
00:29:22 that's all I've been doing the last couple of days.
00:29:25 It's really been annoying me
00:29:27 because this whole month has basically been,
00:29:29 okay, I'm a bit sick.
00:29:30 I should wait until I get better, try to get better.
00:29:33 Oh God, when am I going to get better?
00:29:35 And I haven't been working enough on anything.
00:29:38 One, because I feel like I need to rest in order to recuperate.
00:29:43 And other times it's just because I feel so weak
00:29:45 that I can't even do anything.
00:29:49 And it sucks.
00:29:50 My secret project is definitely on hold
00:29:53 and that's annoying me a little bit
00:29:55 because it's quite close to being presentable
00:29:57 and I can't yet do anything.
00:30:00 Can't yet tell anyone.
00:30:02 I think mine might be ready
00:30:05 by the time this episode comes out.
00:30:07 I feel like I might have said that before,
00:30:09 but God damn it, this time I really mean it.
00:30:12 This time I really mean it.
00:30:14 You better do it.
00:30:16 One of us has to have a project that isn't secret anymore.
00:30:19 No, I know.
00:30:21 Yeah, but I can't say anything else about it just yet.
00:30:29 Another unfortunate casualty of me being debilitated
00:30:34 is that I'm probably not going to be able to draw the comic
00:30:39 for the deadline, the Kato Anthology.
00:30:41 I did want to mention that I think the day this episode comes out
00:30:46 this Friday is the last day of April
00:30:49 and I think that's the deadline for the Kato Institute.
00:30:52 That's the deadline.
00:30:53 Anthology, the Kato Anthology, link in the description.
00:30:57 If you want to see that on the day that your submission is due.
00:31:01 Yeah.
00:31:03 On the one hand, there's like,
00:31:06 in order to feel good, you must set goals and complete them.
00:31:11 Yeah, that's true.
00:31:12 I should try and finish this goal I set
00:31:15 doing these six pages in a month.
00:31:18 For context?
00:31:19 Surely that would be doable.
00:31:20 In case anyone doesn't know,
00:31:22 it's a comic anthology that's looking for submissions
00:31:25 and going to submit something and it's open to everyone.
00:31:30 Everyone's encouraged to look and then draw a comic in one day.
00:31:35 Get it in by midnight. Bam.
00:31:37 Do it.
00:31:39 Okay, sorry.
00:31:40 I think that the best case scenario is that I go to the doctors tomorrow,
00:31:45 they do all the tests, they say,
00:31:47 okay, you have this or you don't actually have this,
00:31:49 but I clearly have something.
00:31:51 So they say, here's the medication for it.
00:31:53 I take it, I feel good.
00:31:54 And then for the rest, I can like cram,
00:31:57 like drawing into the end of the month.
00:32:00 That's like, how many days is that?
00:32:02 So like after Monday, I've got one, two, three, four.
00:32:05 Four days, draw six pages.
00:32:07 Ah, geez, that's quite a lot actually.
00:32:10 Because I've got to draw and then color them.
00:32:12 I want them to look nice.
00:32:14 I can fucking do that though.
00:32:16 Four days, four full days.
00:32:19 As long as I feel good, then everything will be fine.
00:32:22 But the most important thing is my health comes first.
00:32:25 I was kind of stressing out over getting this comic done.
00:32:30 And I've sort of, on the one hand,
00:32:34 dismissed the idea that I will like force myself to get it done.
00:32:39 Because at the moment, it could be bad for me to work hard.
00:32:46 I don't want to get worse.
00:32:50 But yeah, if I feel good, then I can sprint right at the end.
00:32:59 Right on.
00:33:01 I'm sure they...
00:33:04 I feel like those guys would be super chuffed
00:33:10 to put something of yours in there.
00:33:13 In that their anthology.
00:33:15 I think they're PCP heads.
00:33:19 I think they like us.
00:33:22 Oh, no.
00:33:24 Oh, it's true.
00:33:26 Oh, yeah.
00:33:28 Wow.
00:33:30 Actually, they specifically asked me for one.
00:33:34 Actually, they specifically wanted to put the white lion in there.
00:33:41 Which, I don't know, if you don't know, that's a comic that I made like...
00:33:45 God, it must be like seven years ago now.
00:33:49 They were like, can we put that in the anthology?
00:33:52 And I was like, yeah, I mean, sure.
00:33:54 Why not?
00:33:56 Why the heck not, my dudes?
00:33:58 So that's what I'm putting in there.
00:34:00 They wanted it. They wanted to see it.
00:34:02 And I want them to see as well.
00:34:07 Yeah.
00:34:09 And then I guess that will be concluding the deadlines on that.
00:34:13 And then I got to draw the cover.
00:34:15 I should probably draw the cover before the end of the month, actually.
00:34:18 And then I guess they're going to be launching the Kickstarter for that soon after.
00:34:25 Probably pretty soon after that.
00:34:27 I'm not exactly sure when.
00:34:31 Well, hey, I am sorry that you're feeling shitty, Gib.
00:34:37 That sucks. And I hope they can fucking sort you out.
00:34:42 Yeah, I mean, I hope so.
00:34:44 It was confusing because I like, at the call 111, the emergency hotline for like medical stuff,
00:34:52 you say, what's the problem?
00:34:55 I tell them the problem and they say, okay, we're going to get a doctor to call you
00:35:00 and then you can talk to the doctor on the phone about it.
00:35:02 And I did that.
00:35:03 I told him what was going on.
00:35:04 I told him how long it had been.
00:35:06 And then he said, hmm, that seems a little strange.
00:35:09 And at that point, I was like, fuck, I've probably given him the wrong impression.
00:35:15 I probably exaggerated the wrong thing, made him think it's one thing where it couldn't be like a contradicts.
00:35:21 It's like, shit, have I made an error in observing my own self and what's going on?
00:35:30 Because that's the biggest thing I always worry about when I go to the doctors
00:35:34 because they ask you questions about what's been happening.
00:35:37 And I don't know.
00:35:38 I just feel bad.
00:35:39 You just like stick a needle in me and call it like cured.
00:35:43 Like, can you just do all of it?
00:35:45 No, I have to be the one to give them the information.
00:35:47 Otherwise they can't fucking do anything.
00:35:49 They don't know anything about what's going on.
00:35:52 And then he says, okay, this seems a bit strange.
00:35:54 I'm not sure why this would be happening.
00:35:57 And then he gives me a bunch of tests in a text and I printed those out.
00:36:02 And I'm going to just go to the hospital and give them.
00:36:04 I'm going to go up to the lady or the man or whoever is at the front desk and say please.
00:36:10 I don't know what these papers mean.
00:36:12 There's just loads of words on them.
00:36:13 They just say test.
00:36:15 Just do them.
00:36:16 Please just do these tests.
00:36:17 I don't know where I am.
00:36:18 I don't know what I'm doing.
00:36:19 And then they'll be like, okay, shut up, calm down, go to the waiting room.
00:36:23 That's probably what's going to happen.
00:36:25 I get a little anxious about like doing it properly because I'm like, oh God,
00:36:31 what if I go to the wrong hospital?
00:36:32 What if they want me to go to this other hospital that's closer to where I used to live?
00:36:35 Because that's where my name is on record still.
00:36:39 Do they want me to go to a specific hospital?
00:36:41 Can I just go to a hospital and say please?
00:36:47 I have no idea how this is going to work,
00:36:49 but I'm sure they will be able to point me in the right direction anyway.
00:36:52 And it shouldn't be a problem.
00:36:54 I should stop worrying about it.
00:36:56 And you know, the best thing is I don't need to worry about it cussing anything.
00:36:59 That's the main thing.
00:37:01 I just need to be socially anxious and awkward in real life and that's the main problem.
00:37:06 And then they're going to stick with me.
00:37:08 Rub it in.
00:37:09 Rub it in, why don't you?
00:37:10 Yeah, yeah, you know, I'm just like, you know, I'm going to patch up as good as new
00:37:14 and I'm going to be fucking rich because of it.
00:37:16 They're going to give me money, in fact.
00:37:19 They're going to give me money.
00:37:20 Fucking communist Europe.
00:37:24 They pay you to get sick.
00:37:26 Why would you want to incentivize that?
00:37:28 We need innovation, not infection.
00:37:31 That's my slogan that I'm going to run for fucking governor of, I don't know,
00:37:36 some shithole Southern state on.
00:37:38 The, the, the, you know, that remind, remember, stop me if I've talked told you this before,
00:37:46 but remember when I got the kidney stone and I went to the hospital and then I got a bill.
00:37:52 They sent, they sent me a, yeah, they sent me a bill for like $6,000.
00:37:57 Because I didn't have insurance.
00:38:00 Yeah, they sent me a bill for like $6,000 because they didn't have insurance.
00:38:05 And then I was like, well, I'm just going to ignore this.
00:38:09 Okay.
00:38:10 No, this is not, this is not necessarily smart, but this is what I did.
00:38:14 I said, like, I'm just going to kind of hope this goes away.
00:38:17 So I didn't, no, this, this story has a surprise ending.
00:38:22 Well, I mean, you know, the story goes on.
00:38:24 Who knows if it's actually over, but I think it has a surprise.
00:38:27 A surprise ending.
00:38:29 This, so I was like, I just, I just, I, this must be a joke, you know, $6,000 for like
00:38:35 spending like three hours in a hospital bed.
00:38:39 This is like a joke.
00:38:41 And I think it's stupid.
00:38:42 And I'm just going to ignore it.
00:38:44 I'm laughing.
00:38:47 God.
00:38:48 So it's $6,000.
00:38:50 Presumably it would have been less because if I had insurance, because like the insurance
00:38:55 companies have covered something and also like insurance companies just have like, they
00:39:00 have it all like pre worked out.
00:39:03 My understanding is that hospitals just have like unbelievably huge prices that things
00:39:08 cost all the time.
00:39:10 But like insurance companies just have it all sort of pre negotiated that it's like
00:39:14 less than that.
00:39:15 So they don't have to pay what a normal human has to pay because it's just, and it's
00:39:19 just expected that everybody has insurance.
00:39:23 Something.
00:39:24 So if you don't, it's like your quadruple fuck.
00:39:27 But so yeah, I got a bill for $6,000.
00:39:29 And then I was like, ignore it.
00:39:30 And then like weeks later, I get a bill from a collections agency that's like, no, we're
00:39:38 we're fucking serious.
00:39:40 We got a fucking, you got to send us this money.
00:39:42 And I was like, um, okay, I'm scared.
00:39:45 So I went and I Googled it and they can't, it's not like a charging interest.
00:39:50 I believe it's illegal to charge interest on a medical bill, at least in Massachusetts.
00:39:54 It is.
00:39:55 So I'm like, it's not like I'm losing more money by not paying it.
00:40:00 So I'm just, I'm just going to ignore it and, and just see what happens because I'm
00:40:06 like, I don't think the situation will can get any worse.
00:40:10 The worst thing that can happen is I take like a credit hit, like my credit score goes down
00:40:15 because I don't pay this bill.
00:40:17 But I think that it worked and the bill is gone.
00:40:23 And I, the reason why I think this is because at some point I was browsing Twitter and I
00:40:30 saw like a, a TikTok, I think a reposted TikTok of someone asks, what is something you know
00:40:38 about?
00:40:39 Like what's a law that you know about that feels illegal or something you, you learned
00:40:43 that feels illegal to know.
00:40:45 The guy answers and he says, in America, most hot or hospitals are nonprofits.
00:40:52 Technically, which means that by law, they must have a charity care clause, which means
00:40:58 that if you are poor to a certain degree, they are obligated to give you care without
00:41:05 making you pay for it.
00:41:07 And I think that maybe I, because this was like a couple of years ago, I was making like
00:41:12 $12,000 a year or something.
00:41:14 So like very, very little.
00:41:16 I think I definitely was below the poverty line.
00:41:19 Definitely would have, if anyone would have qualified for that, I think I would have.
00:41:23 So I think I just technically qualified for charity care.
00:41:26 And probably the reason why I haven't heard anything about this bill in months is that
00:41:31 the collections agency in the hospital were like, if they did any digging on my finances
00:41:36 at all, looked at my tax records at all, they were like, oh, this guy doesn't make any money.
00:41:40 He's like, he cleared the bar that we like legally can't charge him this money.
00:41:47 I think I won.
00:41:49 I think I beat the system.
00:41:51 All you gotta do is to be very poor.
00:41:55 It got him.
00:41:59 I'm not going to say, I don't know, how do I say it?
00:42:03 It does make certain problems go away.
00:42:05 It does.
00:42:07 I'm not being poor enough.
00:42:14 Yeah, it's weird though.
00:42:16 Imagine if I had made like a few more thousand dollars a year.
00:42:24 Again, this is just what I think happened and maybe tomorrow I'll get another letter
00:42:28 that like this collections agency is garnishing my wages or something.
00:42:31 I kind of don't want to look into it because I don't want to kick the hornet's nest on this.
00:42:36 Maybe they're just really busy with shit and it's COVID and now they have all these claims
00:42:40 and I'm just low on the priority list and they'll get me in due time or something.
00:42:46 I mean, it's one of those things where it's like, in order to follow up on something like this,
00:42:52 they need people hired to do all of that digging and finding you and asking you and like sending
00:42:58 a tough guy around to your house to like put the kidney stone back, like shove it down your throat.
00:43:04 Shove it up my dick again.
00:43:12 Well, I mean, that's what a collection agency is.
00:43:15 A collection agency is the fact that such a thing exists is like humanity truly exists in a fallen state.
00:43:23 If you're a business, you're like, hmm, well, this guy owes me money,
00:43:29 but collecting on it would be work.
00:43:33 One of our employees would have to contact this guy.
00:43:38 We have all these legal, we have to send them a certain number of notices
00:43:42 and give a certain amount of notice before filing suit against them and that's all labor.
00:43:47 So we're going to outsource that labor of harassing this guy for the money that he owes us
00:43:53 and in return we give them a cut, basically, is what a collection agency is.
00:44:00 And so you would think that they'd be prepared to do that work unless there's some legal technicality
00:44:07 that means that I actually don't have to pay it, which means that they won't get anything
00:44:11 or there's just other, there's so many other claims that they think are either for more money
00:44:17 or are more likely to actually pay out that they're going to prioritize them over me.
00:44:21 I would imagine that even if you are liable to pay.
00:44:26 It's kind of the same principle that lets you get away with shoplifting
00:44:29 because a lot of the time the minimum wage employees that work at a store,
00:44:32 it's just not worth their time.
00:44:35 They're not paid to stop you from stealing.
00:44:38 So I think a lot of the time, even if they saw you doing it, they're not going to do anything
00:44:42 because why would they?
00:44:45 This is a principle that holds true across society.
00:44:50 If there is some legal precedent for like sometimes if somebody's poor enough,
00:44:54 you can't collect from them, that would sort of dissuade collection agencies
00:44:57 from following up on leads that would require money
00:45:00 or at least it would dissuade the hospital from paying the collection agency
00:45:05 that money to go and do that work if there's a chance that you don't have the money.
00:45:10 And they're just like, it's been long enough. Fuck it.
00:45:13 We've got other things to worry about.
00:45:16 I don't know if this TikTok is to be believed, then it seems like I definitely...
00:45:24 You know, the TikTok says like go to the hospital's website
00:45:28 and you can look up their policies and you can find it.
00:45:33 And I never actually did that for the hospital I went to, which I should have.
00:45:37 I am tempted to do it on stream now, but it would probably take too long.
00:45:42 So maybe I will do that afterwards.
00:45:44 We're not streaming, Ben.
00:45:45 Whatever.
00:45:46 Oh, but you know what? I'm going to stream because I need to pee.
00:45:50 No. No.
00:45:52 No.
00:45:53 I'm going to pee. I'm going to do it.
00:45:55 God, are you still on microphone?
00:46:01 Do I need to distract the audience for a while?
00:46:06 I'm going to give you a preview of the voicemails that are coming up.
00:46:11 The first voicemail this week is called Ben Gay.
00:46:15 So that's exciting.
00:46:16 By the way, I'm really relieved there's not...
00:46:21 Let's see. Speakfibes sorts them into pages.
00:46:26 How many per page? It's 20 per page.
00:46:29 Last week we had like three full pages of voicemails, so that was dog shit.
00:46:34 Fuck all of you.
00:46:35 I don't care about you that much.
00:46:37 This week we've only got a page and a half, so we've got...
00:46:41 I'm telling them about voicemails.
00:46:43 This week we have a more reasonable amount.
00:46:45 We're back to reality.
00:46:47 So that's good.
00:46:49 Okay.
00:46:51 What were we talking about?
00:46:53 Hospitals.
00:46:55 I meant to check that hospital's charity care policy, but I never did.
00:47:02 I'm just kind of...
00:47:04 I kind of just am hoping that my theory, that that is what happened, is true.
00:47:09 Because it would be very convenient for me if that bill just like,
00:47:14 eh, we technically can't make and pay that.
00:47:16 Eh, damn.
00:47:18 But damn, imagine...
00:47:21 It's fucked up, though.
00:47:23 People...
00:47:25 If you have more bills, if you have a house that you got to pay taxes on,
00:47:29 and you got a family, and you got kids you got to take care of,
00:47:33 and you got all these...
00:47:35 Maybe you got parents, elderly parents or something, or whatever it is,
00:47:38 that makes your expenses higher.
00:47:41 Such that you need like a job, like a real job,
00:47:45 because I don't have like a quote-unquote real job.
00:47:48 You need...
00:47:50 Some people got expenses that only a real job can pay for,
00:47:53 and if you are like that, you might be...
00:47:59 You might have less disposable income than I do,
00:48:04 even though you make more money,
00:48:07 and therefore also...
00:48:10 I might qualify for such a thing as this, but you don't,
00:48:14 because your income is higher,
00:48:16 even though you're maybe poorer than me,
00:48:20 because your money is going somewhere that you have to be putting it into.
00:48:24 And that is frustrating.
00:48:27 That sucks. That sucks so bad.
00:48:30 I guess it's difficult to gauge what is your disposable income,
00:48:35 because you can decide how much you want to spend on things like food.
00:48:39 You know, it's like...
00:48:41 To an extent.
00:48:43 It's like you could go out to fancy restaurants, I guess.
00:48:46 There's a...
00:48:48 I would say...
00:48:50 There's an upper and lower limit to these things.
00:48:52 I mean, I would say if you are making a choice to spend more on food
00:48:58 than you need to be spending on food,
00:49:00 then I would say that that extra you're spending is part of your disposable income.
00:49:05 I guess, but what is the threshold for the minimum amount of food money?
00:49:11 What if you just live in a place where the food is a little more expensive?
00:49:14 It would be what...
00:49:16 Well, I mean, you can't really...
00:49:18 Yeah, I would say it's...
00:49:21 I don't know.
00:49:23 The minimum amount of food you have to spend is what I spend.
00:49:25 They sell food per dollar to calorie ratios.
00:49:29 I wish they did.
00:49:31 That's how I choose what I buy.
00:49:33 I looked because I looked it up and I'm like,
00:49:35 ah, no, this pack of like three dozen hot dogs from Costco
00:49:41 is like the best calorie two dollar ratio.
00:49:45 So now what I eat for half my meals is two hot dogs and a slice of cheese.
00:49:52 It's good.
00:49:53 It's good. I like it.
00:49:57 Fuck.
00:49:58 What was I saying?
00:49:59 No, I had a thought.
00:50:04 Oh, I don't know.
00:50:06 Yeah, some people can make...
00:50:09 You can make more money, but still...
00:50:12 Oh, because Bernie, it's like Bernie always said,
00:50:15 you know, most people in America, like they can't afford a $500 expense.
00:50:19 And then that includes people who are like working jobs.
00:50:22 They work harder than I do.
00:50:24 They probably make more money than me,
00:50:27 but they also have expenses it goes to.
00:50:30 And those people would be completely fucked if they had a kidney stone
00:50:35 because suddenly they would be hit with a $6,000 hospital bill
00:50:40 and they wouldn't have what I hope is a genuine ability to wriggle out of it
00:50:48 through a financial technicality that I'm hoping that I have successfully done.
00:50:54 This is a real sword of Damocles right here.
00:50:57 For who?
00:50:58 $6,000 sword over you.
00:51:00 You're not sure whether it's there.
00:51:02 It's like a shrodinger sword, sword of Damocles.
00:51:05 You're right.
00:51:06 I assume it's no longer there, but if I...
00:51:09 Yeah, I'm like, hmm, you know, if I...
00:51:12 Imagine you're Damocles and you're just like,
00:51:15 I haven't seen that sword in a while.
00:51:17 No one's mentioned it in a while, so maybe it's not hanging over me.
00:51:20 I just won't look up.
00:51:22 I'm just not going to look up because, you know, if it is there,
00:51:25 I don't want to know about it.
00:51:27 Yeah, that's exactly what it is.
00:51:33 I will look...
00:51:34 I'm going to look up the hospital's policy and see if I can find it
00:51:37 because the TikTok said...
00:51:40 No, this TikTok says I'm good.
00:51:43 No, this TikTok says that I'm going to be okay.
00:51:45 Maybe look up the rule, like the law that they said in the TikTok
00:51:49 instead of looking at the TikTok again.
00:51:51 Yeah, well, the TikTok says...
00:51:54 The TikTok says where to look for these policies,
00:51:59 so I should do that.
00:52:01 Just?
00:52:02 Definitely.
00:52:03 Just to see.
00:52:04 Yes.
00:52:05 I mean, I guess in the way you put it,
00:52:07 is looking it up the policies would be looking up at the sword of Damocles
00:52:12 to check whether it's there and you don't want to do that.
00:52:15 Yeah, I mean...
00:52:16 But you should do it.
00:52:17 God.
00:52:18 I mean, I could...
00:52:19 I mean, the real look would be like...
00:52:23 I could literally call the hospital or contact the collections agency
00:52:27 to ask, do I still owe you all that money?
00:52:30 But no, I'm not going to do that.
00:52:32 No.
00:52:33 No.
00:52:34 No fucking way.
00:52:36 Everyone told me...
00:52:37 Especially looking over your shoulder, seeing this as an assassin,
00:52:40 a kidney stone assassin.
00:52:42 My parents told me...
00:52:44 To sure it can up your dick again.
00:52:47 My parents told me, like, Ben, you got to pay that bill
00:52:50 because, like, you know, they're going to charge you interest
00:52:52 or, like, oh, it's going to affect your credit score.
00:52:55 But I think they were wrong.
00:52:57 I think I fucking outsmarted it.
00:52:59 They told me, like, oh, Ben, your aunt is an accountant.
00:53:02 Contact your aunt.
00:53:03 She can help you pay the bill.
00:53:04 She can help you get a payment plan.
00:53:06 You know, they'll have...
00:53:07 They're happy to get anything.
00:53:08 You can agree to a payment plan that's only, like, $20 a month or something.
00:53:12 And I was like, oh, okay, I don't want to pay $20 a month,
00:53:15 but, like, I guess if it's that or nothing, I guess I'll do it.
00:53:17 I think I...
00:53:19 And now I'm glad.
00:53:20 I'm kind of glad that I didn't do what everyone told me
00:53:23 was the responsible thing,
00:53:24 which is contact the hospital,
00:53:26 get on a payment plan for $20 a month.
00:53:28 I think I wriggled out of the whole thing.
00:53:30 I think I fucking warmed my way out of...
00:53:34 Even the mildest of consequences.
00:53:36 The furtive Ben St. so easily forgotten.
00:53:38 For the audacity...
00:53:39 For the audacity of having a kidney stone
00:53:42 that I needed to...
00:53:43 That I was in such extreme pain for that I had...
00:53:45 They put me on a morphine drip for it.
00:53:50 I survived.
00:53:53 I think...
00:53:56 The bill included things like a scan.
00:53:59 And I honestly don't remember them, like, doing a scan.
00:54:02 Like, some sort of, like, magnetic imaging to, like, see, like, is my kidney...
00:54:07 Is my fucking ureter blocked by a kidney?
00:54:09 I don't remember them doing a scan.
00:54:11 The bill says that they did,
00:54:13 and that's what cost, like, several of the thousands of dollars.
00:54:18 It's horseshit. It's bullshit if that's true.
00:54:21 But, like, that's what they said.
00:54:25 I don't know.
00:54:26 I don't know, but every time, every time, like,
00:54:28 one of my parents, like, brings up,
00:54:29 they're like, did you ever contact the hospital?
00:54:31 I'm like, no.
00:54:34 Well, I did, I did for a while, because I was at...
00:54:37 I did a few times to contest the bill.
00:54:41 To be like, I called them up and I'm like,
00:54:43 it says that I got a scan.
00:54:45 I don't think you gave me a scan.
00:54:47 I'm pretty sure that's a false charge.
00:54:49 I'm pretty sure you just, like, charged me for a scan that you never did.
00:54:52 Is that true? I don't know.
00:54:54 I could have been zonked out on morphine and they did it,
00:54:56 and I don't even remember.
00:54:58 That's possible.
00:54:59 I'm just gonna go with the narrative that this is a fake charge that they fucked up.
00:55:02 I'm gonna gum up the works by contesting as much as this as I can
00:55:05 before it moves on to, like, they're garnishing my wages
00:55:08 and taking me to court or whatever.
00:55:10 So I did that, and then I contested it.
00:55:12 They were like, okay, we'll look into it,
00:55:14 and then I never heard from them again.
00:55:16 Never heard from the collections agency again.
00:55:18 So I could call them up and be like,
00:55:22 hey, whatever happened with that dispute I filed,
00:55:24 but no, I won't.
00:55:26 I don't know. I feel like I won.
00:55:28 I guess it's a good thing that nobody listens to the PCP,
00:55:30 otherwise they'll find out if this was like a Matt and Mega podcast.
00:55:34 Fucking HR person, like some pencil pusher at that hospital
00:55:39 is like listening to this show and they're like, wait a minute,
00:55:41 that's that one guy.
00:55:43 That's that guy. I have his file right here.
00:55:45 I remember that voice of that Ben St.
00:55:51 What a, I don't know.
00:55:53 Fingers crossed, I guess.
00:55:55 Fingers crossed that I scraped by.
00:56:01 I don't know, man. I don't know.
00:56:05 You know, I got a different topic.
00:56:08 I got something to talk about.
00:56:10 I said I didn't have anything to talk about this week,
00:56:12 but I got something.
00:56:14 Maybe this is like stupid,
00:56:16 but I was thinking about my characters from Veilhape.
00:56:20 We got Pump, we got Alleyoop,
00:56:22 we got Siby,
00:56:24 and then we got Tiki,
00:56:26 and I was thinking, hmm,
00:56:28 the blue lady, yes.
00:56:30 Oh, Tiki, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:56:32 Is Sib the little purple thing?
00:56:34 Siby's the little purple guy, yeah.
00:56:36 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:56:40 Siby and Tiki both, actually.
00:56:42 Siby less so, but I was thinking about
00:56:44 how they are
00:56:46 based off of video game characters
00:56:48 that were themselves based off of
00:56:52 sort of reductive
00:56:54 racial stereotypes.
00:56:56 I was realizing that Tiki
00:56:58 does have a bit of a black face
00:57:00 going on with her lips.
00:57:02 And I was like, ah, jeez.
00:57:04 Wait, hold on.
00:57:06 Is that a bad thing?
00:57:08 Am I harassed?
00:57:10 I mean, she looks like a Tiki mask,
00:57:12 and like, I don't know,
00:57:14 when I google Tiki mask,
00:57:16 they kind of look like that.
00:57:18 They do.
00:57:20 But like, I was just thinking,
00:57:22 because like, Siby is like,
00:57:24 you know,
00:57:26 Inspiro, the little guys who have the eggs
00:57:28 or whatever and you chase them
00:57:30 they're always running away from you.
00:57:32 Yes, yes, yes, yes.
00:57:34 I think that is like
00:57:36 an Arabian stereotype
00:57:38 of some kind where it's like,
00:57:40 ah, like the Middle Easterners
00:57:42 with their cloaks
00:57:44 and shrouds
00:57:46 and stealing treasure
00:57:48 and running around with it.
00:57:50 And I'm like, ah, jeez.
00:57:52 Like, obviously it's not terribly racist
00:57:54 in like the portrayals of the game.
00:57:56 Oh, these little blue guys
00:57:58 with the nasty little faces.
00:58:00 Yeah, the little blue guys.
00:58:02 It's not like a malicious, intense sort of thing.
00:58:04 It's just sort of like a racial coding
00:58:06 that has survived from times when they were
00:58:08 I mean,
00:58:10 portrayed like that in media and it's like,
00:58:12 okay, I liked that game
00:58:14 and I liked the little funny guys,
00:58:16 but like, I realized where it comes from
00:58:18 and I don't necessarily know whether it's a bad thing
00:58:20 if I keep Siby.
00:58:22 But Tiki's a little more like,
00:58:24 I don't know,
00:58:26 I don't know anything about this.
00:58:28 This is just me coming to some sort of realization
00:58:30 that it might be construed as a bit
00:58:32 like coded
00:58:34 African tribe
00:58:36 and insensitive with the lips thing.
00:58:38 I don't know.
00:58:40 It was like that
00:58:42 when you got canceled for the fucking
00:58:44 tweet about
00:58:46 how to draw
00:58:48 African characters
00:58:50 or like those sorts of lips
00:58:52 in anime or whatever.
00:58:54 The Usob tweet.
00:58:56 I was realizing that Tiki has those lips.
00:58:58 I'm like, ah, shit.
00:59:00 I got a redesigner, but I was trying to redesign her.
00:59:02 I couldn't figure out exactly
00:59:04 what would be the best way to do it.
00:59:06 I don't know.
00:59:08 What do you think? What do you think about all that?
00:59:12 Well, isn't
00:59:14 I mean, Tiki masks
00:59:16 are a Hawaiian thing, right?
00:59:18 They have
00:59:20 similar like African masks,
00:59:22 but
00:59:24 it's a different style.
00:59:26 This thing in my head at the time
00:59:28 is like Tiki totems
00:59:30 and also African masks
00:59:32 and
00:59:34 it's sort of Akua Kuu from Crash Bandicoot
00:59:36 and the Shaman from Populous
00:59:38 the Beginning.
00:59:40 Tiki.
00:59:42 Let's see.
00:59:46 Is there like a Wikipedia page
00:59:48 on Tiki masks? I don't even know
00:59:50 like what
00:59:52 I think they're Hawaiian.
00:59:54 Tiki masks are Hawaiian
00:59:56 but they don't look like
00:59:58 they're a little different.
01:00:04 They seem to have a lot of open mouths
01:00:06 like screaming.
01:00:10 When I Google it
01:00:12 I'm not sure
01:00:14 which of these images
01:00:16 are authentic
01:00:18 what does a Tiki mask
01:00:20 historically look like
01:00:22 versus what is
01:00:24 an image someone made based on
01:00:26 maybe like a bastardized
01:00:28 sort of
01:00:30 version that
01:00:32 a pop culture conception
01:00:34 of what it is.
01:00:36 So I don't know.
01:00:38 I mean, I feel like
01:00:40 the general gist is pretty
01:00:42 clear.
01:00:44 If she's supposed to be Hawaiian
01:00:46 and she's got big lips like
01:00:48 the masks and the masks
01:00:50 have that
01:00:52 I mean
01:00:54 Usopp is actually supposed to be
01:00:56 half black so I don't know
01:00:58 there's the
01:01:00 I really hate this
01:01:02 I really hate this whole thing.
01:01:04 I know
01:01:06 I kind of hate it as well
01:01:08 but I can't see it now.
01:01:10 I guess I'm just sort of like
01:01:12 I'm wondering about
01:01:14 the right thing to do
01:01:16 because like
01:01:18 obviously my intent was
01:01:20 pure I did not
01:01:22 in any way
01:01:24 it didn't mean it to be like
01:01:26 racially coded in a bad way
01:01:28 because Tiki is cool so I like her anyway
01:01:30 so it's not even like a negative
01:01:32 stereotype it's just that
01:01:34 she looks kind of like
01:01:36 the lips thing the fish lips
01:01:38 as they say.
01:01:40 I mean it's not even her human face
01:01:42 it's like a wooden mask
01:01:44 true yes
01:01:46 I do have a canon face underneath
01:01:48 so it's not like
01:01:50 it's not like you drew a human
01:01:52 with like exaggerated
01:01:54 you know gollywag lips
01:01:56 this is like a mask
01:01:58 from a culture
01:02:00 which again I'm not exactly sure
01:02:02 what the masks look like
01:02:04 native historically
01:02:06 well there's so many types
01:02:08 I guess it's sort of
01:02:10 mostly it's very simplified
01:02:12 in my drawing
01:02:14 but like the
01:02:16 meant to depict faces for various reasons
01:02:18 so many different types
01:02:20 of cultures
01:02:22 all over the world I think
01:02:24 some African masks are like
01:02:26 the equivalent of like the Greek
01:02:28 happy
01:02:30 and sad faces for like theater
01:02:34 so it's just sort of a thing
01:02:36 it's just like an exaggerated version of a face
01:02:38 I don't know
01:02:40 I don't think anybody
01:02:42 would ever have a problem with it
01:02:44 but maybe there's a chance
01:02:46 so like there's maybe a way to
01:02:48 to
01:02:50 like change her design
01:02:52 in a way that's just slightly
01:02:54 less bad or
01:02:56 slightly more good or I don't know
01:02:58 if you're a viewer of the Procrastes
01:03:00 podcast you should read
01:03:02 and then tell me what you think
01:03:04 of this
01:03:06 I think
01:03:08 I'm gonna
01:03:10 risk a slightly controversial opinion
01:03:12 here but I think
01:03:14 that maybe if no one
01:03:16 has been offended
01:03:18 that it's not worth
01:03:20 thinking
01:03:22 about how to avoid offense
01:03:24 I don't know unless it's like
01:03:26 unless you know for sure
01:03:28 that something would bother people
01:03:30 why even worry about it
01:03:32 and I mean usually the way that you know
01:03:34 that is because someone says
01:03:36 I am bothered by this
01:03:38 well I
01:03:40 I mean I'm going mostly off of the
01:03:42 the tweet thread
01:03:44 with the people talking about the lips
01:03:46 I'm like yeah I guess that is
01:03:48 like even if it's unintentional
01:03:50 even if it's like just how it is
01:03:52 for the record I don't
01:03:54 I don't think I was completely
01:03:56 wrong in what I was trying to say
01:03:58 I just think I said it in an overly
01:04:00 hostile way
01:04:02 which is needless
01:04:04 yeah
01:04:06 but regardless
01:04:08 the main guy, the first guy
01:04:10 sort of had a point and at least some people
01:04:12 they just
01:04:14 react to these things in a way
01:04:16 so it's like
01:04:18 obviously belljap is very very very
01:04:20 niche only a small portion
01:04:22 of even my fanbase has read it
01:04:24 so it's like
01:04:26 like if there were
01:04:28 people who didn't like it
01:04:30 they probably haven't just found them yet
01:04:32 like they probably haven't found me
01:04:34 I don't know
01:04:36 you could
01:04:38 ugh god
01:04:40 I
01:04:42 I just think that if there's
01:04:44 since I
01:04:46 have an inkling that maybe it could be
01:04:48 a problem
01:04:50 it's not that I
01:04:52 want to avoid cancel culture
01:04:54 before it happens or anything because like whatever
01:04:56 um
01:04:58 it's that I want to
01:05:00 just solve the
01:05:02 problem before it becomes one
01:05:04 before somebody finds it to be offensive
01:05:06 if you know what I mean
01:05:08 um
01:05:10 yeah
01:05:12 like I can see that it's like
01:05:14 it's on the level
01:05:16 it's on what do you call it
01:05:18 on the boundaries of like potentially
01:05:20 being a thing
01:05:22 it's not like I could be destroyed
01:05:24 by this character design or anything
01:05:26 I just feel like it's like
01:05:28 it's
01:05:30 what's the word?
01:05:32 it's pushing it
01:05:34 if you were worried about getting in trouble
01:05:36 I would say don't
01:05:38 nothing bad is going to happen
01:05:40 if you're worried about like
01:05:42 yeah okay
01:05:44 if you're worried about like is this
01:05:46 perpetuating something I don't want to perpetuate
01:05:48 then I don't know maybe
01:05:50 I mean yeah I'm sure you could probably
01:05:52 take a little bit to just to not even
01:05:54 remind
01:05:56 anyone of that it wouldn't take
01:05:58 it wouldn't even take that much I don't think
01:06:00 I don't know exactly how you do it
01:06:02 yeah I mean I was
01:06:04 I was trying for a bit and I was like
01:06:06 coming up to a brick wall I had like some
01:06:08 little ideas where it's be like
01:06:10 changing
01:06:12 the reason I drew it like that in the first place
01:06:14 is just because it's the easiest way
01:06:16 to depict a like
01:06:18 a lip
01:06:20 shape but bigger
01:06:22 and I didn't really think about what that was implying
01:06:24 potentially
01:06:28 but like if you look at like masks
01:06:30 they don't all have
01:06:32 I mean the tiki masks
01:06:34 I wasn't really going for them even though she's
01:06:36 cool tiki which is kind of like another thing
01:06:38 it was like conflating
01:06:40 just like oh it's tribal so it's like it's
01:06:42 multiple whatever cultures
01:06:46 just throw them all together
01:06:48 it's mostly a video game character thing
01:06:50 than it is like a cultural
01:06:52 thing and that's I feel like that was a mistake
01:06:54 well not
01:06:56 a terrible mistake but like it's something
01:06:58 I can work on to like
01:07:00 if I'm gonna draw from real life
01:07:02 culture in the future
01:07:04 I should be a little more accurate
01:07:06 with it so that it's not like a character
01:07:08 of that culture
01:07:10 you know what I mean
01:07:12 yeah I guess
01:07:14 I guess it's a common pitfall
01:07:16 that uh
01:07:18 yeah you're right
01:07:20 yeah I just
01:07:22 like imagine you're a
01:07:24 you're a Maori tribesman or something
01:07:26 and you see this and it's like
01:07:28 this like I don't know
01:07:30 Hawaiian or African style mask
01:07:32 and it's like oh yeah this character's name is tiki
01:07:34 like a tiki mask and you'd be like
01:07:36 oh there's another fucking idiot
01:07:38 there's another fucking idiot white person
01:07:40 who doesn't know what the fuck they're talking about
01:07:42 yeah I mean it's true
01:07:44 I really wasn't thinking about it
01:07:46 yeah like yeah now that I can't
01:07:48 now that I have a brain I could think about it
01:07:50 I'm like well
01:07:52 I should just change her just change her somehow
01:07:54 I want to keep her the same
01:07:56 mostly I like the mask
01:07:58 like rectangle head shape
01:08:00 yeah the eyes are cool
01:08:02 mm-hmm
01:08:04 maybe her name can change
01:08:06 I don't know whether I want to go back and like retroactively
01:08:08 change Belle Jape as well
01:08:10 because it's a little little edits to do
01:08:12 I don't know whether it's worth it
01:08:14 wait like what
01:08:16 like every instance of her name
01:08:18 if I change her name I have to
01:08:20 I wouldn't have to but I could go back
01:08:22 and like change it on the website
01:08:24 I don't really know what I want to bother with that
01:08:26 mm-hmm it could just be like
01:08:28 oh that was just a thing I did
01:08:32 yeah I mean
01:08:34 I don't know on the one hand
01:08:38 yeah I don't know
01:08:40 that's like
01:08:42 I guess I would
01:08:44 if you decide like the name
01:08:46 is different I guess changing the character's name
01:08:48 is one thing
01:08:50 that would just be just basically a big
01:08:52 like a find and replace job
01:08:54 um yeah
01:08:56 I don't know I'm neutral about that
01:08:58 uh okay as long as
01:09:00 as long as it's not like
01:09:02 oh I gotta go back and I gotta like you know redraw
01:09:04 this panel and redraw this panel and redraw this panel
01:09:06 oh yeah I'm probably not gonna redraw
01:09:08 yeah like that's a that's a fucking trap
01:09:10 that's a fucking black hole
01:09:12 and also yeah it's finished
01:09:14 it's it's not like a
01:09:16 yeah yeah
01:09:18 replacing the text is simple enough
01:09:20 it'll just take a few hours
01:09:22 for an hour I don't know
01:09:24 um I don't know
01:09:26 her full name was tiki wiki mickey mouse
01:09:28 which was like
01:09:30 like supposed to be silly
01:09:32 yeah and uh
01:09:34 like it's a wikipedia it's mickey mouse
01:09:36 like mickey mouse
01:09:38 and her first name is tiki
01:09:40 it's just like uh that's dumb
01:09:42 that's like the sort of thing you come up with
01:09:44 when you just sort of like uh
01:09:46 name uh I don't know
01:09:48 tiki wiki
01:09:50 on the one hand
01:09:52 I don't know
01:09:54 I don't I don't
01:09:56 say this to like double down on the idea
01:09:58 that like this character is a deeply
01:10:00 deeply problematic and offensive
01:10:02 I'm not trying to do that but it is
01:10:04 what jumps to mind is like
01:10:06 is that name sort of like a
01:10:08 ching chong ching chong ching kind of like
01:10:10 yeah that I was thinking
01:10:12 about that it's like
01:10:14 I was just like
01:10:16 when did I make that
01:10:18 I think but because belgium was like
01:10:20 I don't fucking know I'll make a comic
01:10:22 I guess I started drawing stuff
01:10:24 I put her in there because I wanted
01:10:26 that sort of a character
01:10:28 god I don't know
01:10:30 she had potions hell I mean if you're
01:10:32 when brood they were scientifically brood
01:10:34 ooh how interesting if you're
01:10:36 if you're serious about it I would
01:10:38 say honestly I don't know
01:10:40 if there's anyone like this that listens
01:10:42 to the show but if anyone is
01:10:44 like Maori which is where tiki
01:10:46 comes from I don't like ask if you
01:10:48 could find someone like that and be like
01:10:50 what do you think about this character like is this
01:10:52 does this is this like
01:10:54 offensive looking is the name offensive like
01:10:56 what could be
01:10:58 changed
01:11:00 it's yeah the
01:11:02 whole thing about it being offensive like I know
01:11:04 people will hear me talking
01:11:06 about this and they'll be like oh you're so scared
01:11:08 it's not there's nothing wrong with it
01:11:10 yeah just
01:11:12 you're just scared of the mob the twitter mob
01:11:14 like you're just you're just
01:11:16 look at look at give virtue signaling
01:11:18 over here like yeah it's not
01:11:20 I want it's that I'm I'm
01:11:22 I'm more conscientious of these sorts
01:11:24 of things than I used to be when I made it
01:11:26 and I'm like
01:11:28 I understand I understand
01:11:30 the process is zero
01:11:32 it's not
01:11:34 okay if I if I may if I may opine
01:11:36 for a moment I think what you're saying
01:11:38 what I'm getting
01:11:40 is that it's not that you're like
01:11:42 afraid of the twitter mob
01:11:44 afraid of being cancelled afraid of
01:11:46 backlash or whatever
01:11:48 and it's not that you're like oh no
01:11:50 I gotta I gotta virtue signal I gotta
01:11:52 show everyone how woke I am
01:11:54 by now I gotta show ever I gotta
01:11:56 show everyone how woke I am by erasing
01:11:58 by erasing this
01:12:00 this Polynesian representation
01:12:02 from my media or white people
01:12:04 only
01:12:06 it's that like
01:12:08 it's that you've thought about it and you've been like
01:12:10 maybe this characterization
01:12:12 to some people who know
01:12:14 something about it
01:12:16 maybe they would think I look stupid
01:12:18 by this right
01:12:20 yeah yeah I understand
01:12:22 it's just there's ways to be
01:12:24 to be more based
01:12:26 about these things
01:12:28 sure I would genuinely
01:12:30 if you if you can find anyone I would
01:12:32 I would ask someone who knows about this
01:12:34 stuff
01:12:36 I'd be curious what do they have
01:12:38 to say about it what is their opinion
01:12:42 yeah
01:12:44 fascinating because then I was looking
01:12:46 at like Aku Aku from Crash Bandicoot
01:12:48 and he is like even more
01:12:50 but like there hasn't been as much
01:12:52 I think I found one article
01:12:54 people being like
01:12:56 Aku Aku from Crash Bandicoot
01:12:58 yeah
01:13:00 I don't even know what he looks like
01:13:02 oh okay it's that guy
01:13:04 right it's that guy he's a
01:13:06 wooden mask he's got the feathers in his head
01:13:08 and you know
01:13:10 eyes but he's got like the big red
01:13:12 lips and it's like he does
01:13:14 he does if you never
01:13:16 if you never thought about it before you may have never noticed
01:13:18 but whoops
01:13:20 yeah could be kind of
01:13:22 could be kind of a
01:13:24 could be kind of a huh moment
01:13:26 so like well I don't know
01:13:28 I don't know I don't know I don't know I want to
01:13:30 push back on this I want to push back on this a little bit
01:13:32 a little bit because if he's supposed
01:13:34 to be
01:13:36 like a fucking eastern
01:13:38 what's the islander if he's supposed to be
01:13:40 like an islander
01:13:42 then like it doesn't make sense
01:13:44 to be like that's an offensive african
01:13:46 stereotype because like he's not
01:13:48 I mean that's another aspect of it
01:13:50 is the the conflation of
01:13:52 like different cultures just because
01:13:54 they are not western
01:13:56 which is the thing I am also doing
01:13:58 in this whole thing I'm like
01:14:00 yeah you know it's only
01:14:02 so based I can be I can't I can't erase
01:14:04 all of my faults
01:14:06 but like I don't know
01:14:08 no certainly I think
01:14:10 most people like most of everyone
01:14:12 just enjoys Crash Bandicoot and it's a fun
01:14:14 game and nobody cares about the idea of cancelling
01:14:16 a ku a ku because who cares it's just like
01:14:18 yeah you jump around you're a crazy
01:14:20 fucking
01:14:22 orange guy in that game
01:14:24 true that's what I'm
01:14:26 that's what I'm saying that's what I'm saying
01:14:28 yeah but just because
01:14:30 it you know
01:14:32 it's I guess it's just
01:14:34 just because nobody necessarily
01:14:36 gives a shit I give a shit
01:14:38 just because nobody gives a shit
01:14:40 about changing my own thing because I have the power
01:14:42 to do it just because nobody gives a shit
01:14:44 that's a funny thought
01:14:46 what I'm trying to phrase it
01:14:48 in a way that's making me laugh like just just because
01:14:50 nobody gives a shit that it's wrong
01:14:52 or something or bad
01:14:54 doesn't mean that I
01:14:56 that it's not a problem or I don't know
01:14:58 it doesn't mean that it can't be
01:15:00 fixed even though nobody thinks it's a problem
01:15:04 it's really just like
01:15:06 there's a way to be more based
01:15:08 that that's my main thing
01:15:10 yeah sure because it's it's lazy
01:15:12 it's a lazy
01:15:14 a cartoony like no
01:15:16 thought put into it
01:15:18 facsimile of that kind of a
01:15:20 tribal
01:15:22 mask wearing person
01:15:24 is ticky
01:15:26 there's so much
01:15:28 more nuance to the cultures that
01:15:30 this is very vaguely
01:15:32 derived from that I could put into the character
01:15:34 design that would be better
01:15:36 I think
01:15:38 yeah
01:15:40 I can't say that there's like
01:15:42 absolutely none
01:15:44 that no aspect of it is like
01:15:46 like worried about
01:15:48 cancel because like
01:15:50 there's a little bit there's a tiny little bit
01:15:52 I mean that's the spark that started it
01:15:54 nothing's gonna happen
01:15:56 the worst literally the worst
01:15:58 case scenario would be
01:16:00 someone like
01:16:02 someone repost it
01:16:04 and is like this is a this is deeply
01:16:06 offensive and then people
01:16:08 say like I am yes I am offended
01:16:10 and it gets spread around a lot and a bunch
01:16:12 of people see it they're like this
01:16:14 this give and take character
01:16:16 this give and take character so fucking
01:16:18 racist and then they come and they harass
01:16:20 you about it and the New York Times
01:16:22 and the New York Times
01:16:24 literally literally and I
01:16:26 don't say this to be like
01:16:28 actually you should be more racist because
01:16:30 it's actually gonna help you because it gets more eyes on
01:16:32 you but at the same time
01:16:34 no it's like it's literally just free publicity
01:16:36 and then it gives you
01:16:38 and then it get no I'm serious this is why
01:16:40 it's bullshit all the all the right wingers
01:16:42 that are all like the cancel mob is come
01:16:44 for another it's all bullshit because they know
01:16:46 they know that the cancel mob coming
01:16:48 for you is literally just an opportunity to
01:16:50 grandstand about how canceled you are
01:16:52 and to perform
01:16:54 and to perform
01:16:56 well you have one or two choices you can either perform
01:16:58 like an apology and have a redemption arc and
01:17:00 make people like you or you can
01:17:02 publicly defy the
01:17:04 you know the vitriol you can publicly
01:17:06 be like hey fuck you woke mob
01:17:08 hey I'm conservative and then
01:17:10 and then your fellow morons will be like
01:17:12 I respect that so much like oh yes
01:17:14 yeah he's pretty he's defending
01:17:16 my western culture I love this man I'm
01:17:18 gonna I'm gonna subscribe to his substack
01:17:22 yeah it's it's it's not
01:17:24 I think when I say that there's a like
01:17:26 a little bit of me that's like worried about
01:17:28 the cancel thing it's not about
01:17:30 the mob coming after me
01:17:32 and saying you're bad it's about
01:17:34 me hurting someone in the
01:17:36 first place I just rather not
01:17:38 that have that happen ever
01:17:40 if somebody has like a grievance with
01:17:42 me or something I do that is
01:17:44 like I don't agree with
01:17:46 like there's no way that that could be
01:17:48 like construed as bad
01:17:50 it's obviously not bad and then
01:17:52 the mob comes after me then I'll be like
01:17:54 shut up but if it's like
01:17:56 something like Tiki like
01:17:58 that's kind of that's a little bit
01:18:00 and I'd be like yeah that is a little bit
01:18:04 I would just I would just agree with it
01:18:06 if it's a criticism like that and if
01:18:08 I can agree with that idea
01:18:10 then I think I
01:18:12 I think it's worth working on it
01:18:14 before anything happens just because I
01:18:16 can that makes sense
01:18:18 yeah if you if you are thinking
01:18:20 about it and you're like hmm
01:18:22 here's a hypothetical criticism that
01:18:24 someone could give me and
01:18:26 you know what I agree with it
01:18:28 I guess that's that says something
01:18:30 it's
01:18:32 like I don't know I think it's
01:18:34 pretty pretty obvious that
01:18:36 it could be a problem at some point for
01:18:38 some person I'd rather it not
01:18:40 yeah well that's it
01:18:42 that's that's my you know
01:18:44 get cancelled now I feel I feel like
01:18:46 I feel like you've I feel like
01:18:48 you're giving I feel like
01:18:50 you're exploring the question
01:18:52 in the in a
01:18:54 in the in the way it
01:18:56 deserves to be interrogated
01:18:58 so that's good
01:19:00 I guess
01:19:02 good virtue signal points
01:19:04 get mmm yeah
01:19:06 you're 100 damn I didn't
01:19:08 know Gib was so woke oh my god
01:19:10 but
01:19:14 if you get so if you get enough woke
01:19:16 points you get your third eye
01:19:18 you can start to see the the the
01:19:20 the blood-borne beasts all over the place
01:19:22 the insight finally
01:19:24 finally
01:19:26 you can start to you can start to
01:19:28 um
01:19:30 you can start to see all the offensive
01:19:32 racial caricatures that we erased
01:19:34 they all they start appearing
01:19:36 like ghosts they were there
01:19:38 all along invisible
01:19:40 and then I get my Zenpacto
01:19:42 and I start slaying them that's a whole
01:19:44 other thing
01:19:46 there's like I'm just imagining like
01:19:48 you you get woke you
01:19:50 get woke you go on Twitter you get woke
01:19:52 you virtue signal about
01:19:54 like you know whatever
01:19:56 and then suddenly your third eye opens
01:19:58 and there's just all the there's all these ghostly
01:20:00 just like gollywogs just like
01:20:02 I don't know
01:20:04 lumbering around just like in your in your
01:20:06 house
01:20:08 I don't know
01:20:10 they were just just waiting
01:20:12 just waiting to be discovered
01:20:14 oh my oh man
01:20:16 the ghost the ghost
01:20:18 the ghost of Aunt Jemima the ghost of Aunt
01:20:20 Jemima is there it's like now you're ready
01:20:22 you're ready to receive your quest
01:20:24 I get
01:20:26 my Zenpacto I go Bankai and it's
01:20:28 reparations that's the name of the sword
01:20:36 I don't know anything
01:20:38 about bleach
01:20:40 but I think it's funny
01:20:42 Bankai
01:20:44 is just like the like Super Saiyan
01:20:46 but Bankai
01:20:48 is a super sword that you what like manifest
01:20:50 in the spirit realm or something
01:20:52 Zenpacto is your like spirit
01:20:54 blade and it just does like a special
01:20:56 something or other
01:20:58 and then everyone's got a special
01:21:00 second form and it's got a different
01:21:02 special ability and it changes shape
01:21:04 or whatever
01:21:06 and all Zenpactos have a name
01:21:08 all your swords have a name
01:21:10 and mine would be reparations
01:21:12 so every Zenpacto
01:21:14 has a Bankai
01:21:16 which is like a Super Saiyan version
01:21:18 of the sword
01:21:20 you have to be woke enough that's what they do in Bleach
01:21:22 that's right that's how
01:21:24 you unlock the it
01:21:26 that's how you get it yes
01:21:28 we should genuinely
01:21:30 idea for a manga
01:21:32 it's bleach but
01:21:34 the way you unlock your powers is by being more
01:21:36 woke
01:21:40 whoever has the most virtue
01:21:42 unlocks the power
01:21:44 oh god there's a
01:21:46 there's a story there's kind of how it is in every
01:21:48 like hero story like you need to be
01:21:50 the most virtuous
01:21:52 courageous hero
01:21:54 yes you need to say
01:21:56 um
01:21:58 I think things are a little fucking bad
01:22:00 and then you get your
01:22:02 super powers well you get
01:22:04 no
01:22:06 most stories like that you get super power
01:22:08 it's not by it's not by like recognizing
01:22:10 the problems in the world it's by like
01:22:12 it's by like
01:22:14 becoming I don't know
01:22:16 protecting any given love interest
01:22:18 or protecting your love interest
01:22:20 oh the town is going to get flattened by
01:22:22 a big guy with a foot
01:22:24 I'm going to kill him oh I'm so
01:22:26 fucking woke right now
01:22:28 it's either about your interpersonal
01:22:30 bonds with your friends or whatever
01:22:32 or it's about your um
01:22:34 your like confidence
01:22:36 your believing in yourself
01:22:38 it's about
01:22:40 whether you have the whether you have
01:22:42 the wherewithal to ask the
01:22:44 cute girl on a on a date
01:22:46 I think you may you can probably
01:22:48 unlock in certain media you can probably
01:22:50 unlock super powers by doing that
01:22:52 yeah it's that or you're like
01:22:54 um you go to
01:22:56 demon power
01:22:58 you just have something
01:23:02 um
01:23:04 if you if you if you're if you're just like
01:23:06 I don't know is that is there any
01:23:08 is there any like shonen
01:23:10 that's like I have super powers
01:23:12 but only when I'm being like a completely
01:23:14 immoral like douchebag
01:23:16 like I have a demon
01:23:18 inside of me that gives me
01:23:20 super strength and lets me shoot laser beams
01:23:22 but only
01:23:24 when I am like
01:23:26 but only when I'm being like a
01:23:28 base randy and objectivist
01:23:30 and like just acting in my
01:23:32 um what's the what's the phrase
01:23:34 my rational self-interest
01:23:36 only when I'm disregarding
01:23:38 the the the well-being of others
01:23:40 I
01:23:42 I can't think of anything specific
01:23:44 but I feel like that character type
01:23:46 probably does exist in like a
01:23:48 an anti-hero there should
01:23:50 there should be the villain that has a redemption
01:23:52 arc where the power is derived
01:23:54 from bad things but when they change
01:23:56 sides they become weak for a bit
01:23:58 imagine imagine like use their power
01:24:00 remember um at the end of bakuman
01:24:02 when they basically just make
01:24:04 death note but their version of death note
01:24:06 is the thing with like the white demon
01:24:08 and the black demon um
01:24:10 the angels yeah their angels
01:24:12 or whatever I imagine
01:24:14 like is it called a fellow
01:24:16 I think would that would be a clever name
01:24:18 maybe that's just what I would name it
01:24:20 um whatever
01:24:22 the board game no it's called
01:24:24 revered yes
01:24:26 yes no it's called reversi
01:24:28 but reversi is another
01:24:30 name for the game a fellow so
01:24:32 I'm like right but but only sort of
01:24:34 yeah yeah yeah it's called reversi
01:24:36 um I imagine
01:24:38 that but like the the white demon
01:24:40 the white demon gains his power
01:24:42 from like being communist from
01:24:44 like I don't know from like
01:24:46 collect collective
01:24:48 thinking and like
01:24:50 valuing like like like
01:24:52 everyone whereas like the black one gains
01:24:54 his powers from like from disregarding
01:24:56 others will be I don't know there's maybe
01:24:58 maybe someone's done that before I don't know
01:25:00 the ultimate communist
01:25:02 the ultimate communist or socialist
01:25:04 or whatever like
01:25:06 super power of all time is
01:25:08 Goku's spirit bomb where he has everyone
01:25:10 put their hands up
01:25:12 it's literally
01:25:14 it's literally democratizing
01:25:16 the battle because like if
01:25:18 enough people like really want Goku
01:25:20 to win this fight
01:25:22 against Frieza or whatever because like the entire
01:25:24 universe is like hmm
01:25:26 so you're saying I can I can choose whether
01:25:28 I can vote for Goku by giving him some of my spirit
01:25:30 energy yes please
01:25:32 fill out the ballot put it in the mail
01:25:34 and
01:25:36 yeah it's
01:25:38 literally just like voting
01:25:40 voting with your power
01:25:42 yeah a good a based
01:25:44 a based
01:25:46 a based socialist base
01:25:48 realized Goku
01:25:50 he still believes in the power of
01:25:52 electoralism it's a little cringe
01:25:54 uh
01:25:56 is that character arcs
01:25:58 archetype sort of because he's like
01:26:00 he's a villain who uses firebending
01:26:02 hatred to fuel this firebending
01:26:04 but when he comes a good guy
01:26:06 he loses his ability to be
01:26:08 strong with fire and he has to figure out
01:26:10 a different way from the dragons
01:26:12 to firebend
01:26:14 like the base way
01:26:16 Zuko loses his firebending
01:26:18 when he becomes good
01:26:20 when he joins the good guys
01:26:22 he used to
01:26:24 just fuel it by anger and rage
01:26:26 and then he learns with
01:26:28 Aang at the dragon temple
01:26:30 the dragon dance to like
01:26:32 get pure firebending
01:26:34 like the the cool kind
01:26:36 I don't even remember that at all
01:26:38 that was a really cool god I love
01:26:40 I have a child I've been such a good show
01:26:42 wait does he get
01:26:44 does it like change his firepower
01:26:46 when he's like getting it
01:26:48 from like a pure place or something
01:26:50 when he's getting it from like
01:26:52 it's
01:26:54 I don't know if maybe it changes
01:26:56 visually but like it's more
01:26:58 powerful
01:27:00 it's sort of like the
01:27:02 the difference between the
01:27:04 I don't fucking remember
01:27:06 it's good pretty bit yeah
01:27:08 cool
01:27:10 hey that was a pretty good show
01:27:12 that was a pretty good show I think I watched
01:27:14 college or something
01:27:16 it's been a long time I've seen it
01:27:18 my roommate's rewatched it last year
01:27:20 I haven't watched it like a couple years ago
01:27:22 it's a good
01:27:24 fucking ride because it's
01:27:26 like obviously
01:27:28 starts off a little
01:27:30 slow with the few
01:27:32 filler-esque episodes
01:27:34 but like the
01:27:36 the narrative builds upon itself
01:27:38 like everything that happens
01:27:40 you know it's all part
01:27:42 of the one big story and the longer it goes
01:27:44 the more stuff gets called back
01:27:46 to and things that have happened
01:27:48 come crop up again and characters you've seen
01:27:50 before it's like ah
01:27:52 it's just been building it's like an escalating
01:27:54 tension
01:27:56 goes all the way to the end and there's no
01:27:58 bullshit unlike in Korra where there's
01:28:00 lots
01:28:02 yeah I never watched Korra
01:28:04 heard a lot of mixed things so
01:28:06 I probably never will
01:28:08 Korra's okay
01:28:10 but that's just the thing
01:28:12 it's okay in this in the universe
01:28:14 that had Avatar the last day and but
01:28:16 Korra is like a disappointment
01:28:18 but it's fine there's a few nice moments
01:28:20 there's some characters I like
01:28:22 a lot of them are just sort of minor
01:28:24 like enjoyment
01:28:26 like the comic relief characters
01:28:28 the new
01:28:30 soccer the new Zuko kind of
01:28:32 they're
01:28:34 they're whatever
01:28:36 I think Tenzin
01:28:38 Tenzin is like Aang's son
01:28:40 Aang's second son
01:28:42 or third son
01:28:44 he's the coolest
01:28:46 he's trying to re-resurrect the air nomads
01:28:48 Korra herself
01:28:50 is alright and then there's
01:28:52 some other funny characters
01:28:54 I remember
01:28:56 there was like an evil airbender
01:28:58 at one point he did some really fucked up stuff
01:29:00 in like season 3
01:29:02 damn that's messed up
01:29:04 he stole the air out of a person
01:29:06 fucked up stuff
01:29:08 it's like he airbended the air out of
01:29:10 someone's lungs and they suffocated to death
01:29:12 like dude
01:29:14 Aang would never do that
01:29:16 that's pretty good
01:29:18 this is new airbending
01:29:20 this is new fucked up airbending
01:29:22 it's like evil airbending
01:29:24 it's like bloodbending
01:29:26 but the air version
01:29:28 it was cool
01:29:30 say we've been going for an hour and a half
01:29:32 do we want to go to voicemails
01:29:34 yeah
01:29:36 I think I'm done with things I gotta say
01:29:38 I got
01:29:40 I've said too much
01:29:42 I've said too much
01:29:44 yeah let's just get started
01:29:46 whatever

01:30:12 3 2 1 go
01:30:14 hey Ben so last week you were going on
01:30:16 about how the void grifters can't afford
01:30:18 an RV because they don't have the money
01:30:20 well first of all you're right
01:30:22 they can't afford an RV
01:30:24 but that doesn't mean they necessarily
01:30:26 can't get an RV
01:30:28 I mean they can open a credit card and then max
01:30:30 it out or they can
01:30:32 go to a money lending service and then deal with the consequences
01:30:34 later I mean
01:30:36 it's a bad decision to end up in a shit ton of debt
01:30:38 but I mean
01:30:40 what has Yig ever been known for making good
01:30:42 decisions
01:30:44 there's a will there's a way Ben
01:30:46 it can still happen
01:30:48 you don't get enough credit on a credit card
01:30:50 to max it out that much
01:30:52 like I opened a credit card
01:30:54 last year
01:30:56 and they gave me like $2,000 worth of credit
01:30:58 so that would never be
01:31:00 enough
01:31:02 some people have suggested that
01:31:04 they could rent the RV
01:31:06 and I have looked into it
01:31:08 and RV rentals
01:31:10 seem to cost like $100
01:31:12 a day
01:31:14 or more so
01:31:16 that just seems insane
01:31:22 if the RV was gonna happen I think
01:31:24 someone would have to be buying it for them
01:31:28 so
01:31:30 are they like still having
01:31:32 are they still saying like we're gonna do the RV
01:31:34 it's funny
01:31:36 was that just a thing they said once
01:31:38 and they've just let it sit
01:31:40 they said it over and over again
01:31:42 like they said it they said it a lot
01:31:44 that they were gonna do they were gonna get an RV
01:31:46 and move into it
01:31:48 they are on a trip
01:31:50 right now
01:31:52 to Elco Nevada
01:31:54 and there is
01:31:56 they have not shown the vehicle
01:31:58 they have they have not shown the vehicle
01:32:00 that they are traveling in
01:32:02 uh
01:32:04 perhaps deliberately
01:32:06 Riley made a tweet the other day
01:32:08 that was like damn
01:32:10 the RV lifestyle
01:32:12 is awesome I would recommend it
01:32:14 but he doesn't actually say
01:32:16 that there is an RV
01:32:18 and I think there is definitely not one
01:32:20 but it's like
01:32:22 I hope I'm not reading too much into it
01:32:24 but it kind of reads like he's sort of pretending
01:32:26 that they have one
01:32:28 I don't know if they had one
01:32:30 they probably would have shown it
01:32:32 wouldn't they?
01:32:34 of course you would
01:32:36 well they said
01:32:38 in one stream they said
01:32:40 if we get the RV
01:32:42 oh we're never gonna show the RV
01:32:44 because then if you knew
01:32:46 what our RV was then people could
01:32:48 call the cops on us and report us
01:32:50 and fuck with us and dox us
01:32:52 which is just huge
01:32:54 cope
01:32:56 just laying the groundwork for them to pretend
01:32:58 you wouldn't need to
01:33:00 take a picture of
01:33:02 the license plate
01:33:04 take a picture from the inside
01:33:06 RV is just
01:33:08 you could take a picture from the inside
01:33:10 you could take a picture
01:33:12 out the window
01:33:14 you could show the make and model
01:33:16 nobody could fuck with you unless they knew
01:33:18 exactly where you were
01:33:20 and they could maybe call
01:33:22 if someone really wanted to fuck with you
01:33:24 and they knew
01:33:26 exactly where you were
01:33:28 even narrower than the town
01:33:30 they would have to know exactly what town you're in
01:33:32 and what part of town you're in
01:33:34 and maybe they could call the local police department
01:33:36 and be like there's a stolen RV
01:33:38 in this one parking lot somewhere
01:33:40 got em
01:33:42 that's what it would take
01:33:44 there's no reason not to show
01:33:46 the RV
01:33:48 anyway
01:33:50 but
01:33:52 let's hold aside the point because all you need to know
01:33:54 is
01:33:56 about the RV is you just need to go to
01:33:58 isthereanrvyet.com
01:34:00 and just to keep
01:34:02 yourself updated on the
01:34:04 RV status
01:34:06 and I'm just checking it right now
01:34:08 is there an RV yet? No
01:34:10 it still says no so there's no RV
01:34:14 I've staked my entire reputation on it
01:34:16 so you know it's trustworthy
01:34:18 the first time you tweeted this
01:34:20 I was like ah gee
01:34:22 this is a little far
01:34:24 but at this point the longer it goes on
01:34:26 the funnier it becomes
01:34:28 see
01:34:30 I knew that's what would happen
01:34:32 I said this because
01:34:34 they said they're getting this RV
01:34:36 they
01:34:38 last month they said they were getting it at the end of the month
01:34:40 this month they're saying
01:34:42 they're getting it at the end of the month
01:34:44 I know they won't do it
01:34:46 it's a game of chicken
01:34:48 how long
01:34:50 are they going to insist
01:34:52 see I know something
01:34:54 about saying you're going to do things at the end of the month
01:34:56 myself how long are they
01:34:58 going to keep saying end of the month end of this month
01:35:00 end of this month we're really doing it
01:35:02 and every single month that it goes on
01:35:04 in which I'm just over here like
01:35:06 hey
01:35:08 there's no RV there's never will be
01:35:10 there's even a website now
01:35:12 by the way Crack made the website
01:35:14 he's a genius
01:35:16 they're together in like minutes
01:35:18 he
01:35:20 and like the longer there's a website and the longer
01:35:22 the longer they insist upon
01:35:24 this one version of reality
01:35:26 while I am over here championing
01:35:28 uh
01:35:30 facts over feelings
01:35:32 the funnier it gets
01:35:34 so I've done this whole bit
01:35:36 I've done this whole bit with an eye toward the future
01:35:38 and it's
01:35:40 it's paying off in spades
01:35:42 it kind of reminds me of Nate
01:35:44 telling me in Munchy that we'll never
01:35:46 make
01:35:48 a Gay for a Day the album
01:35:50 we said we would make an album at Radcon 3
01:35:52 and it took us a long time
01:35:54 it took Munchy coming to London for us to record
01:35:56 the album
01:35:58 but Nate would always say you'll never do it
01:36:00 I don't believe you will do it
01:36:02 I was like cut you
01:36:04 you're an asshole
01:36:06 talking about us like that but then we did it
01:36:08 I think it was
01:36:10 was he being serious
01:36:12 just like you won't do it or was he like
01:36:14 I think it was his way of like encouraging us
01:36:16 to do it by
01:36:18 not believing
01:36:20 outwardly that we could
01:36:22 or that we would because it's like
01:36:24 it's one of those things that does
01:36:26 require a lot of effort and we
01:36:28 after Radcon 3 was over we were far apart
01:36:30 it was like how are we gonna coordinate this
01:36:32 I've never made an album before I don't know what the fuck I'm doing
01:36:34 Munchy
01:36:36 does not know how to sing at all
01:36:38 so he doesn't know what the fuck he's doing
01:36:40 so the only way it could exist
01:36:42 is if we're in the same room and we're just
01:36:44 fucking around with instruments
01:36:46 so it was a terrible terrible album
01:36:48 but we did do it
01:36:50 yeah
01:36:52 like I kind of
01:36:54 know
01:36:56 that by making a thing out of it
01:36:58 and being like there's no RV
01:37:00 there's no RV
01:37:02 there is a
01:37:04 they won't do
01:37:06 this won't happen but there is an outside chance
01:37:08 that maybe like it'll push them
01:37:10 to actually do it to just
01:37:12 approve me wrong which they won't
01:37:14 they can't do it they don't have the means
01:37:16 but if through some weird
01:37:18 chicanery they did
01:37:20 and I was proven wrong
01:37:22 I would still consider that a win
01:37:24 because I want the RV saga
01:37:26 to happen because it would be so
01:37:28 much funnier than
01:37:30 them just
01:37:32 than what's actually going to happen
01:37:34 which is they just kind of like stop mentioning
01:37:36 it less and less
01:37:38 and then
01:37:40 maybe one day they're like
01:37:42 we never really meant to do that
01:37:44 that was just kind of a joke that we were saying
01:37:46 that was just kind of a what if
01:37:48 we didn't really say we were
01:37:50 that's what's really going to happen
01:37:52 and that's boring and lame so I hope that they do prove me wrong
01:37:56 but they will
01:37:58 pressure's on and they're going to fold
01:38:00 I'm in it for the long haul
01:38:02 I've already won
01:38:04 the game
01:38:06 was won already
01:38:08 before it even began
01:38:10 that's my
01:38:12 tactical genius
01:38:14 ok anyway
01:38:16 next one is called
01:38:18 plus three two one
01:38:20 go
01:38:34 horrible it is
01:38:36 ooh I want to know
01:38:38 to the best of my knowledge
01:38:40 Nate has like never
01:38:42 even spoken to Riley
01:38:46 I could be wrong
01:38:48 but I am not aware of like
01:38:50 any interaction at all
01:38:52 yeah I mean even if
01:38:54 he had he wouldn't come on the pcp
01:38:56 to talk about it
01:38:58 he definitely wouldn't do that
01:39:00 he didn't want to talk about it in our like
01:39:02 he is nothing
01:39:04 zip
01:39:06 no Nate never wants to say anything about anything
01:39:10 next voicemail is called
01:39:12 ten dabs out of ten void chaser
01:39:14 review
01:39:16 three two one go
01:39:18 so I just watched the
01:39:20 first hour of void chasers
01:39:22 oh my god
01:39:24 well hi I assume that's how it's meant to be
01:39:26 consumed in the first episode of void chasers
01:39:28 you know I went in with
01:39:30 kind of pretty low expectations
01:39:32 but I like the concept
01:39:34 I didn't hate it
01:39:36 I'll probably watch more
01:39:38 so here's some of my notes
01:39:40 so they wrap a bit
01:39:42 I think it seemed like
01:39:44 it was tough to tell when it was edited
01:39:46 in or not but there were definitely
01:39:48 some sections that were just kind of like
01:39:50 music videos in the middle
01:39:52 I skipped those
01:39:56 they go to Houston
01:39:58 that's where JFK was shot
01:40:00 and they walk around there for a bit
01:40:02 Riley has like one joke
01:40:04 he tells people in Houston
01:40:06 that he's the
01:40:08 super spreader and it's just because he's wearing a cape and all
01:40:12 Dallas
01:40:14 ends with a really bad B roll section
01:40:16 this is like the first long section of the music
01:40:18 and then they spend
01:40:20 way too long at an Arizona rest stop
01:40:24 and then their car gets stuck in a ditch
01:40:26 and
01:40:28 and B says the N word
01:40:30 no
01:40:32 overall it wasn't awful but
01:40:34 the audio was going to fucking stab me
01:40:36 and I hate it
01:40:38 like they could do good audio
01:40:40 they have the equipment to do decent audio
01:40:42 they just don't know how to use it
01:40:44 so
01:40:46 I mean
01:40:48 I guess thanks for watching it so I don't have to
01:40:50 I know
01:40:52 I'm the
01:40:54 I'm the void critic
01:40:56 I don't know
01:40:58 I avoid it
01:41:00 I
01:41:02 I annoyed it so
01:41:04 you can avoid it
01:41:06 what?
01:41:08 okay
01:41:10 next voicemail is called call of the void
01:41:12 3 2 1 go
01:41:14 dangers
01:41:16 all around us
01:41:18 and we are acutely
01:41:20 aware of it
01:41:22 the fear that steel beams might fall
01:41:24 and crush your head
01:41:26 the awareness that you could throw your phone
01:41:28 out of your car window and never see it again
01:41:32 seeing a cop's firearm and imagine yourself
01:41:34 being a small child of color
01:41:36 so as to tempt him into executing you
01:41:38 the momentary impulse
01:41:40 followed by fear and revulsion
01:41:42 at the notion is called call of the void
01:41:44 call of the void
01:41:46 I had to listen to the whole podcast
01:41:48 to see if y'all figured that out but you didn't
01:41:50 so okay here I am doing this
01:41:52 alright love you bye
01:41:56 yeah okay
01:41:58 the thing we were talking about last time
01:42:00 about like
01:42:02 thinking about
01:42:04 stuff killing you and shit
01:42:06 I guess it's called call
01:42:08 is there maybe there's a joke to be made
01:42:10 about the void gazers there
01:42:12 I don't know
01:42:14 whatever thanks for the info
01:42:16 buddy
01:42:18 next voicemail is called incoming
01:42:20 transmission 3 2 1 go
01:42:28 eh
01:42:30 colonel I've infiltrated the base
01:42:32 security was tight
01:42:34 but I managed to sneak into the vents
01:42:36 the mission to execute
01:42:38 tactical espionage on
01:42:40 Nate's succulent boy pussies
01:42:42 progressing smoothly
01:42:44 his chambers are just up ahead
01:42:46 what the
01:42:48 I invite you
01:42:50 into my room
01:42:52 my boudoir of sex objects
01:42:54 that you may enjoy please
01:42:56 oh fuck
01:42:58 oh fuck
01:43:08 I don't even know who died there what happened
01:43:10 but he
01:43:12 I mean
01:43:14 okay well he didn't
01:43:16 this was not a Nate fucker
01:43:18 he was not there to fuck Nate
01:43:20 he was there to perform espionage
01:43:22 on the boy pussy
01:43:24 so I guess he
01:43:26 covered and he got in there
01:43:28 and then did Nate kill him
01:43:30 no I think Nate fucked him
01:43:32 this was a rare case of this guy
01:43:34 didn't want to fuck Nate
01:43:36 but then he had no choice
01:43:38 that's the trick you have to not
01:43:40 want it you have to play hard to get
01:43:42 that's the all yes it's the only way
01:43:44 it's the only way to capture his
01:43:46 interest
01:43:52 okay next voicemail is called crushed
01:43:54 joy 3 2
01:43:56 1 go
01:43:58 hey guys
01:44:00 it's crusher a long time listener
01:44:02 well you know until
01:44:04 Trixie decided to make the
01:44:06 why I should say the inward video
01:44:08 about 2 years back and then I stopped
01:44:10 but after learning about the information
01:44:12 that they were no not kicked off
01:44:14 more left angrily from the
01:44:16 podcast I started listening again
01:44:18 I gotta say it's great to hear all your voices
01:44:20 I missed y'all for about 2 years now
01:44:22 hey anyway I wish you guys the best of luck
01:44:24 with however this
01:44:26 goes thank you
01:44:28 thank you did she
01:44:30 make that video
01:44:32 the is that was that on her channel
01:44:34 I don't I don't remember I vaguely remember
01:44:36 that well I think
01:44:38 there was a video was it a rant
01:44:40 no no no I think
01:44:42 that on the studios it was
01:44:44 like a conversation between Trixie and Riley
01:44:46 about how they're like trans
01:44:48 black no no
01:44:50 but that was more recent
01:44:52 but I mean I don't know
01:44:54 this guy said it was 2
01:44:56 years ago so it must
01:44:58 have been older than that
01:45:00 I vaguely remember
01:45:02 her talking about like
01:45:04 I was raised in like
01:45:06 black schools black neighborhoods
01:45:08 and I grew up saying the word
01:45:10 so it's okay and I'm like
01:45:12 yeah yeah I remember that
01:45:14 I there's um
01:45:16 I someone
01:45:18 was doing a I'm sorry
01:45:20 I forget who it's someone in my discord
01:45:22 was doing a
01:45:24 a rewatch of
01:45:26 PCP and keeping an N word
01:45:28 tally
01:45:30 who
01:45:32 it was like
01:45:34 yeah it was um
01:45:36 they were just seeing who says it the most
01:45:38 and I think like
01:45:40 early on it was Nate
01:45:42 surprisingly was the one who says it the most
01:45:44 early on but then there's that
01:45:46 Trixie goes on like the rant about it
01:45:48 and she like flies ahead
01:45:50 of the competition
01:45:52 um
01:45:54 I don't but that was like still early that was like
01:45:56 within the first like you know few dozen episodes
01:45:58 or so so I assume the
01:46:00 counter has been updated since then
01:46:02 um
01:46:04 yeah I don't
01:46:06 specifically remember I remember that
01:46:08 a video about
01:46:10 why she should say the N word
01:46:12 exists on somewhere
01:46:14 but I don't exactly remember the content of it
01:46:16 um
01:46:18 anyway glad you're listening and glad you're having
01:46:20 fun
01:46:22 my dude
01:46:24 the next voice mail is called fix your server
01:46:26 Ben
01:46:28 3 2 1 go
01:46:30 Ben the people in your server
01:46:32 are unhinged
01:46:34 and need to be checked
01:46:36 there's this guy in the server
01:46:38 fucking Tony Tony chopper
01:46:40 oh wait
01:46:42 fucking
01:46:44 Trixie
01:46:46 this is the opposite of what I thought you were saying
01:46:48 by accident apologizes
01:46:50 corrects himself
01:46:52 and everyone fucking jumps down his throat
01:46:54 fucking oh it's not good enough
01:46:56 your total voice was too defensive
01:46:58 you know all this stupid bullshit
01:47:00 and then Doon Koon comes in
01:47:02 who is trans by the way
01:47:04 tries to defend the guy
01:47:06 give him the Ben for the doubt and they ban Doon
01:47:08 you need to get your people in check
01:47:10 because they're fucking insane
01:47:12 no
01:47:14 see
01:47:16 I can see why you would say that
01:47:18 devoid of context
01:47:20 but these people
01:47:22 like
01:47:24 the pro and on people have like specifically
01:47:26 like irritated my mods
01:47:28 they have like specifically antagonize them
01:47:30 before I don't blame
01:47:32 I don't blame my mods
01:47:34 for having
01:47:36 no patience with them because they have like
01:47:38 they have gone out of their way to annoy here
01:47:40 in the past so
01:47:42 I feel like that's an important
01:47:44 detail that maybe you are not privy to
01:47:46 but it's true
01:47:48 uh
01:47:50 yeah
01:47:52 no I support
01:47:54 I support all these decisions
01:47:56 next voicemail
01:47:58 is called where are the blue rays
01:48:00 Beatrice 3 2 1
01:48:02 go
01:48:04 hey so do you know if the bleep
01:48:06 in the weed blue rays ever came out
01:48:08 um no because
01:48:10 if they didn't then that's two sets of blue rays
01:48:12 a certain someone knows her fans
01:48:14 uh
01:48:16 two can't wait till she calls them entitled
01:48:18 and stupid for wanting a thing they paid
01:48:20 for again
01:48:22 anyway don't rebrand the show
01:48:24 uh
01:48:26 just keep going with the pcp it's fine
01:48:28 um
01:48:30 what does he mean two sets I thought the plebe in the
01:48:32 weed was the one
01:48:34 the plebe in the weed
01:48:36 yeah it was I mean I assume
01:48:38 one blue ray for all the different
01:48:40 seasons of the plebe in the weed they plan to
01:48:42 film
01:48:44 oh maybe
01:48:46 okay um
01:48:48 yeah I mean
01:48:50 I have no more to add
01:48:52 that was the thing we talked about is that Digi
01:48:54 got uppity
01:48:56 that people
01:48:58 this guy knows
01:49:00 but yeah whatever
01:49:02 yes it was it was partially about
01:49:04 this guy know he knows the answer
01:49:06 he knows the answer
01:49:08 that she already did all these things
01:49:10 and said all these things and feels this way
01:49:12 and isn't going to do anything about it
01:49:14 you'd know you don't need me to
01:49:16 explain this to you you cheeky fuck
01:49:18 um
01:49:20 um
01:49:22 uh
01:49:24 seetol from
01:49:26 the proanon
01:49:28 did personally buy
01:49:30 and send Trixie
01:49:32 a blue ray
01:49:34 burner
01:49:36 I promise
01:49:38 nothing will happen as a result of that
01:49:40 um
01:49:42 but it is a funny
01:49:44 there should be a
01:49:46 there should be a sister site is there an rv
01:49:48 yet dot com needs a sister site
01:49:50 is there a blue ray burner
01:49:52 dot com
01:49:54 to which the answer is yes did the blue ray
01:49:56 a ray a blue ray burner arrive
01:49:58 it did it did
01:50:00 so we already know
01:50:02 um
01:50:04 well wait
01:50:06 why would you see it
01:50:08 well is there proof
01:50:10 that they picked it up or brought them
01:50:12 brought it with them on their road trip like
01:50:14 well
01:50:16 how do we know Trixie has it right now
01:50:18 maybe maybe she sold it in the yard sale
01:50:20 I think okay I believe
01:50:22 that seetol got confirmation
01:50:24 from Trixie that she did receive
01:50:26 the
01:50:28 I don't I I think
01:50:30 so I guess I could be wrong but I feel
01:50:32 like
01:50:34 or at least that like the package was
01:50:36 delivered or something yeah
01:50:38 because there's been
01:50:40 not there's been like at least
01:50:42 one moment I can think of where like
01:50:44 Trixie has not checked the
01:50:46 p.o. box that she has for a long time
01:50:48 yeah like maybe it would
01:50:50 have been stuck there or something but if there's
01:50:52 confirmation then that's fine it's possible
01:50:54 I believe so
01:50:56 um
01:50:58 I just need to
01:51:00 pee again quick oh my
01:51:02 god
01:51:04 okay
01:51:06 I'm just you fuck it I'm listening
01:51:08 to the next one it's called new speed
01:51:10 run three two one go
01:51:14 calling all speed runners for those of
01:51:16 you who have already done
01:51:18 the Nate shower speed run
01:51:20 and are looking for something
01:51:22 new to tackle
01:51:24 the pro and on has proposed
01:51:26 a get banned from
01:51:28 bin cord speed run
01:51:30 simple rules don't just
01:51:32 blatantly use slurs
01:51:34 don't spam try to be
01:51:36 creative
01:51:38 to get banned from the server as quickly
01:51:40 as possible make sure you record it
01:51:42 obviously
01:51:44 post it somewhere
01:51:46 and yeah
01:51:48 good luck okay first
01:51:50 this is so annoying
01:51:52 um
01:51:54 so
01:51:56 this is
01:51:58 don't use any slurs don't spam
01:52:00 a few people did this they were
01:52:02 making sock puppet accounts doing it over and over again
01:52:04 they were
01:52:06 just spamming the chat and they were using slurs
01:52:08 so both of those
01:52:10 things were happening
01:52:12 I literally had to lock down
01:52:14 my discord because people just kept doing it
01:52:16 so I had to
01:52:18 like un
01:52:20 yeah
01:52:22 so there's no longer any active invites to my discord server
01:52:24 and it's specifically because
01:52:26 of this
01:52:28 and honestly
01:52:30 the goal
01:52:32 to like grandstand and pretend
01:52:34 that you're doing this in like some kind of ethical way
01:52:36 no you're an
01:52:38 asshole you're just obnoxious
01:52:40 the discord server
01:52:42 is locked so good job
01:52:44 good job
01:52:46 on this whole speedrun
01:52:48 it was such a funny joke
01:52:50 well it's over it's over because
01:52:52 you were shitty about it
01:52:54 not even funny
01:52:56 it's just annoying
01:52:58 stupid
01:53:00 that was another one about my
01:53:02 it was another one about my pro and on people
01:53:04 they were doing a get banned
01:53:06 from bends discord speedruns
01:53:08 funny idea in
01:53:10 concept in practice it's just really
01:53:12 annoying and offensive and just
01:53:14 disgusting and
01:53:16 yeah I've never really understood
01:53:18 like the speedrun getting banned
01:53:20 like I know it's supposed to
01:53:22 illustrate like oh this discord is
01:53:24 like unreasonably
01:53:26 ban heavy but like
01:53:28 if you go into any place and you break the rules
01:53:30 and you get banned really quick
01:53:32 that just means that the moderation team is on
01:53:34 on their game I guess
01:53:36 it would be really easy
01:53:38 to pretend that the ban chord
01:53:40 is just like such a like a hyper
01:53:42 woke or whatever just like
01:53:44 just like a hyper reactive like
01:53:46 uh step out of line and we bring the
01:53:48 ban hammer down kind of place
01:53:50 if you pretend like this individual does
01:53:52 that you don't spam the chat and you don't
01:53:54 use slurs but be honest you do
01:53:56 you all do you kept doing it
01:53:58 jokes over you ruined it
01:54:00 uh next voicemail
01:54:02 I'm mad I'm fucking mad
01:54:04 next one is called just an opinion
01:54:06 three two one go
01:54:08 just finished
01:54:10 rewatching the one piece lecture
01:54:12 good lecture
01:54:14 bad topic
01:54:16 I don't think one piece is a good lecture
01:54:18 topic it's like a
01:54:20 900 chapter
01:54:22 something manga that's better
01:54:24 experienced first hand
01:54:26 than second hand you're absolutely
01:54:28 I think the other lecture topics like
01:54:30 kingdom hearts was a great one
01:54:32 because you don't want to play through
01:54:34 the 10 different games on five different
01:54:36 consoles with like
01:54:38 25 different mechanics
01:54:40 to learn the story
01:54:42 it's long and convoluted
01:54:44 and written by an insane person
01:54:46 guilty gear
01:54:48 you don't want to play through the fighting game
01:54:50 and then you're not oh there's
01:54:52 canon lore and non canon lore
01:54:54 and we won't tell you which switch
01:54:56 you can play all the guilty gear games and not
01:54:58 understand the story at all
01:55:00 sonichu almost impossible
01:55:02 to read due to like the type setting
01:55:04 and like non sequiturs
01:55:06 and chris just deciding
01:55:08 this is happening now
01:55:10 great when it's told to you second
01:55:12 hand by another person
01:55:14 so I decided to put it out there
01:55:16 you guys do great work I love
01:55:18 the lectures
01:55:20 think one piece was a bad topic I think
01:55:22 it should have stayed on the cutting room floor
01:55:24 I agree
01:55:26 100% yeah that
01:55:28 was a lot of the issues I was having with
01:55:30 like ideas I would have
01:55:32 for lectures because it's like
01:55:34 that it needs to be something
01:55:36 that you would otherwise not want to
01:55:38 experience like even tales gets trolled
01:55:40 is maybe a bad idea for
01:55:42 a lecture because it's fun to read
01:55:44 yeah tales gets trolled is a
01:55:46 I agree yeah I agree
01:55:48 I mean it's
01:55:50 I think fewer people
01:55:52 I don't know
01:55:54 I mean I think that one is a little bit redeemed
01:55:56 by the fact that less just the story is
01:55:58 so bonkers and bizarre
01:56:00 someone just kind of tell it to you is at least
01:56:02 entertaining
01:56:04 one piece is like
01:56:06 I mean it's just
01:56:08 I mean it's like a traditional shonen
01:56:10 manga it's basically just like
01:56:12 relating the story of just like a good
01:56:14 manga it's fine
01:56:16 like it's fine and all it's not
01:56:18 imagine doing like a lecture
01:56:20 lecture
01:56:22 just read berserk
01:56:24 you don't need to yeah just read berserk
01:56:26 like the
01:56:28 endless war rfck
01:56:30 lecture that you and munchie did
01:56:32 I can't remember how like effective it
01:56:34 was because it was very like rambunctious
01:56:36 but like that is a perfect
01:56:38 topic because it's so much stuff that happens
01:56:40 that is hard to like
01:56:42 it's not very well archived
01:56:44 and documented that's yeah yeah yeah
01:56:46 not at all you would like there's so much lore
01:56:48 that has happened there and at this point
01:56:50 like there's so many inside jokes
01:56:52 and like references to like previous things
01:56:54 that like would be so
01:56:56 difficult to get caught up
01:56:58 on that's why I was like
01:57:00 I think yeah endless war lore
01:57:02 is like a perfect that's
01:57:04 something that is like extremely
01:57:06 like complicated and
01:57:08 difficult to get to grips with
01:57:10 on on your own
01:57:12 without someone explaining it to you
01:57:14 one piece is not like that I mean it's long
01:57:16 but I mean the lecture is
01:57:18 long honestly
01:57:20 separate issue is just that the one piece lecture
01:57:22 is too fucking long even if it were a perfect
01:57:24 topic like five hours is just too long
01:57:28 but yeah I mean it's a huge
01:57:30 as a YouTube video you can
01:57:32 get it in chunks I guess
01:57:34 I guess sitting there for five
01:57:36 hours was too was too long for sure
01:57:38 I guess I guess that's true
01:57:40 anyway yeah my
01:57:42 my risk a lecture was like it was
01:57:44 it's on the cusp because
01:57:46 Homestuck is very complicated but I don't think
01:57:48 I got enough
01:57:50 into the complicated stuff to
01:57:52 make it interesting
01:57:54 and a lot of a lot of that
01:57:56 you can just get from reading Homestuck
01:57:58 yeah
01:58:00 I mean
01:58:02 at least
01:58:04 I mean it's easy if you just
01:58:06 want to understand risker
01:58:08 then
01:58:10 yeah but it's not that hard to make I just
01:58:12 I just read the comic and I understand risker
01:58:14 and so I'm just really telling
01:58:16 pirates yeah it's like I think it's kind
01:58:18 of the same as tells gets trolled it's like
01:58:20 if you did if you didn't want
01:58:22 to read it then sure
01:58:24 you might get something out of
01:58:26 the lecture about it
01:58:28 it is probably better to just read it
01:58:30 but I can imagine someone who's like I don't want
01:58:32 to read Homestuck it's like
01:58:34 it's like it's like five thousand pages
01:58:36 long it's like a million pages
01:58:38 it's yeah if that one's like
01:58:40 medium medium
01:58:42 topic choice
01:58:44 but next voicemail is called
01:58:46 friggin
01:58:48 colon cooties
01:58:50 friggin cooties okay
01:58:52 three two one go
01:58:54 hey procrastinators it's friggin
01:58:56 so I realized recently that out of the 30
01:58:58 of us at the rad con meetup no less than
01:59:00 five have come out as trans girls
01:59:02 most recently myself
01:59:04 no I'm not saying that you're responsible
01:59:06 same for us that's one in six
01:59:08 there's certainly some correlation so like
01:59:10 what the fuck
01:59:12 any theories as to what's going on
01:59:14 and most importantly who's
01:59:16 next
01:59:18 I got
01:59:20 I got two words
01:59:22 for you
01:59:24 the Jews no I'm sorry
01:59:26 terrible
01:59:30 I don't even understand that's
01:59:32 a complete non sequitur
01:59:34 well that's what
01:59:36 that's what people say though
01:59:38 I mean it's the joke is like
01:59:40 that's what people say it's like
01:59:42 it's all a plot like it's all a Jewish plot
01:59:44 it's this
01:59:46 yeah that's people say it's the same
01:59:48 it's like oh they too I don't know
01:59:50 we can traditional
01:59:52 traditional masculinity or something
01:59:54 I don't know
01:59:56 no um
01:59:58 I don't understand this either
02:00:00 um
02:00:02 what's your what's uh Minerva
02:00:04 oh the double double cast I
02:00:06 think it's I think it's sort of like
02:00:08 yeah it's a it's a culture yeah
02:00:10 the Jews the Jews have
02:00:12 created a cultural movement
02:00:14 in which in which every man
02:00:16 now must be a woman or else be
02:00:18 canceled by the woke mob for the crime
02:00:20 of being a white man so everyone is
02:00:22 becoming a woman to avoid that
02:00:24 and this is going to destroy
02:00:26 the white race
02:00:28 clipped
02:00:30 yes
02:00:32 yes uh no I think it's
02:00:34 it's just because
02:00:36 people who
02:00:38 uh trans
02:00:40 tends to follow
02:00:42 similar circles
02:00:44 like they they they resonate
02:00:46 with similar topics and groups
02:00:48 I think the PCP
02:00:50 it's like it's it's sort
02:00:52 of uh sort of really
02:00:54 I mean it's for for one
02:00:56 comes mostly initially
02:00:58 from Brony culture from us being
02:01:00 Brony youtubers you know what
02:01:02 a lot of people in that culture
02:01:04 are you know what anyway so it's like
02:01:06 I was gonna say I don't I was gonna say I don't
02:01:08 understand it and I don't get like
02:01:10 why the like so many
02:01:12 of like the PCP
02:01:14 and the PCP audience are trans
02:01:16 but now that you say it no if I had
02:01:18 to condense it down to one word yeah brony's
02:01:20 brony's is probably the reason
02:01:22 why it's like every
02:01:24 like it brony's was
02:01:26 going around before
02:01:28 being trans was known as a thing
02:01:30 like I think if it went the other way
02:01:32 around brony the the
02:01:34 pony show would come up and then
02:01:36 trans people would but I wonder
02:01:38 maybe I don't know but I
02:01:40 I wonder
02:01:42 I wonder
02:01:44 because a lot of our audience came from
02:01:46 the brony days but not all of it
02:01:48 I wonder if
02:01:50 a lot of the people who are trans
02:01:52 were also brony's
02:01:54 I wonder if like
02:01:56 I wonder if it's like the people who were brony's
02:01:58 are also those people
02:02:00 and like not so much well that's why I'm
02:02:02 saying it's like it's
02:02:04 it would have been those people and
02:02:06 yeah yeah yeah yeah
02:02:08 people like we made the PCP
02:02:10 we're still the same people that we were
02:02:12 in the horse cast we had our audience
02:02:14 made the PCP we made
02:02:16 that kind of content
02:02:18 Trixie was doing anime stuff so we got a lot of anime
02:02:20 fans in there
02:02:22 and you know all that sort of mixes
02:02:24 like it's niche cultures
02:02:26 sort of quote unquote
02:02:28 social outcasts you know not
02:02:30 normies
02:02:32 and then
02:02:34 there's like a base of people
02:02:36 who follow the PCP
02:02:38 from finding it and liking it
02:02:40 and it's just the
02:02:42 similar types of people
02:02:44 congregate to the same types of
02:02:46 things I think
02:02:48 I would imagine that the incidence of
02:02:50 transness
02:02:52 among the terminally online
02:02:54 is much higher than
02:02:56 among the general population
02:02:58 just for starters
02:03:00 for I mean I think
02:03:02 definitely a lot of it is just
02:03:04 knowledge like
02:03:06 exposure to the ideas because
02:03:08 people
02:03:10 thought about it if they hadn't
02:03:12 heard other people
02:03:14 I mean I think it's two reasons
02:03:16 I mean one I would say that
02:03:18 people who are less
02:03:20 just less
02:03:22 normy inclined to begin with
02:03:24 just less
02:03:26 what's the word I'm looking for
02:03:28 people that are less like
02:03:30 normal
02:03:32 I don't know just less like
02:03:34 social outcast
02:03:36 yeah yeah people that are social
02:03:38 outcasts are more likely to be terminally
02:03:40 online and probably
02:03:42 a lot of trans people are just like
02:03:44 that for just various reasons
02:03:46 a lot of trans people like I mean I can
02:03:48 speak for myself and then in bronies
02:03:50 in particular never felt right
02:03:52 never felt comfortable
02:03:54 in my own skin
02:03:56 especially in
02:03:58 teenage years with puberty and all that
02:04:00 I don't know
02:04:02 whether that necessarily means anything
02:04:04 like I feel like that's a common
02:04:06 a common thing with trans
02:04:08 at least trans women
02:04:10 I think trans men as well
02:04:12 probably or it's just like
02:04:14 you just feel
02:04:16 a lot of
02:04:18 social unease
02:04:20 because the thing you're expected to be
02:04:22 is uncomfortable but you don't know
02:04:24 that there's another way to live
02:04:26 yet
02:04:28 so there's that
02:04:30 but then the other side of it
02:04:32 is probably that like if you are
02:04:34 terminally online
02:04:36 you have more exposure to
02:04:38 trans culture and trans people
02:04:40 and people talking about it
02:04:42 and therefore you
02:04:44 there are probably people who are not
02:04:46 very online
02:04:48 who will never come out as trans
02:04:50 who might if they were
02:04:52 exposed to it
02:04:54 maybe because they just don't know
02:04:56 which you know
02:04:58 that's what they say
02:05:00 people would point to this
02:05:02 my enemies
02:05:04 would point to this and be like
02:05:06 there it is
02:05:08 this is the cultural Marxism at work
02:05:10 they're spreading the virus
02:05:12 of thought that is corrupting
02:05:14 our
02:05:16 white people
02:05:18 but
02:05:20 right this is what they would say
02:05:22 I would characterize it differently
02:05:24 I would say like okay
02:05:26 that's one
02:05:28 you could call it but like
02:05:30 consider that this
02:05:32 being trans
02:05:34 is a
02:05:36 I don't know you could choose to look at it
02:05:38 like before
02:05:40 they found out about it on the internet
02:05:42 this person was not trans
02:05:44 and now they are they have been
02:05:46 changed or
02:05:48 look at it like this person
02:05:50 had a problem
02:05:52 or this person felt a certain way
02:05:54 didn't understand it
02:05:56 or like the way
02:05:58 but then like you know
02:06:00 online discourse or whatever
02:06:02 recontextualized the way they thought about it
02:06:04 in such a way that
02:06:06 they came up with a solution
02:06:08 that they would not have otherwise
02:06:10 which is being trans
02:06:12 right coming out as trans
02:06:14 and it's
02:06:16 really just like
02:06:18 I don't know
02:06:20 it's not that the person is different
02:06:22 it's that like a solution
02:06:24 or a course of action
02:06:26 was suggested to them
02:06:28 and I mean it's up to the person
02:06:30 whether
02:06:32 if that's what makes them happy right
02:06:34 if they're happier
02:06:36 if they're happier being out as trans
02:06:38 being a woman or whatever
02:06:40 then I would how can you look at that
02:06:42 and be like oh the world would be better
02:06:44 you know I'm a transphobe
02:06:46 I think it would be better
02:06:48 because they
02:06:50 they're doing
02:06:52 everyone's got to do
02:06:54 what is good for them makes them happy
02:06:56 and if you
02:06:58 it's not good if you just
02:07:00 never get exposed to it then you never
02:07:02 come to that conclusion
02:07:04 like you're not happier
02:07:06 for it
02:07:08 with regards to transphobia
02:07:10 I think a lot of it is just sort of
02:07:12 a difference of empathy
02:07:14 like the idea that
02:07:16 being trans is just sort of
02:07:18 changing who you are
02:07:20 so that you could be happier with yourself
02:07:22 regardless of what you end up
02:07:24 being or where you start
02:07:26 it's just sort of like doing things that
02:07:28 you know socially or societally
02:07:30 it's like
02:07:32 you're not expected to be like that
02:07:34 but now it's more okay
02:07:36 to try things to make yourself feel better
02:07:38 and it's like the end goal is to feel happier
02:07:40 with yourself
02:07:42 people who are transphobic
02:07:44 usually I think just don't care about
02:07:46 other people they care about themselves
02:07:48 and a lot of the male transphobes
02:07:50 hate trans women because
02:07:52 they are
02:07:54 they are basically
02:07:56 just misogynists who want women to be
02:07:58 pretty for them they don't care about
02:08:00 people
02:08:02 they're just like I don't find
02:08:04 these women who are trans to be
02:08:06 sexually attractive enough for me
02:08:08 that's why I hate them
02:08:10 that's why they shouldn't exist
02:08:12 that's why they should stay as depressed males
02:08:14 and it's like that's
02:08:16 I feel like it's just that they don't have empathy
02:08:18 for other people generally speaking
02:08:20 I mean the transphobes
02:08:22 line of thinking is like
02:08:24 okay
02:08:26 you see
02:08:28 like a trans woman
02:08:30 and you're like
02:08:32 they're like I don't know
02:08:34 maybe they're like I was depressed
02:08:36 but now I'm out as trans
02:08:38 and I'm happier and they're like
02:08:40 you
02:08:42 they're like you made
02:08:44 I don't know they think that you become
02:08:46 sad
02:08:48 you become unhappy
02:08:50 by becoming
02:08:52 exposed to
02:08:54 the idea that you can be trans and that's real
02:08:56 and they think that that is the source
02:08:58 of the unhappiness
02:09:00 versus like
02:09:02 what I think most people
02:09:04 would say is that you
02:09:06 you
02:09:08 recognize that you had something that was making
02:09:10 you unhappy and being trans
02:09:12 is something that you do
02:09:14 to
02:09:16 to alleviate it
02:09:18 yes and this is like a
02:09:20 fundamental misunderstanding
02:09:22 that underlies a lot of transphobia I think
02:09:24 I see it all the time
02:09:26 but I think the root cause of
02:09:28 the dislike of it is
02:09:30 the misogyny
02:09:32 there is like
02:09:34 hatred of trans men
02:09:36 but it seems less loud
02:09:38 because
02:09:40 I don't know just various things
02:09:44 well that was a
02:09:46 that was a rabbit hole
02:09:48 I don't remember what we were talking about
02:09:50 oh cooties yeah yeah yeah
02:09:52 wait I don't even remember what this
02:09:54 that was the voice from
02:09:56 bronies the short answer it's cause you were all bronies
02:09:58 and now your girls
02:10:00 get over it
02:10:02 okay next voicemail
02:10:04 is called
02:10:06 see see the way
02:10:08 see the reason why I have
02:10:10 definitely dodged the trans bullet
02:10:12 is because
02:10:14 I was never in it for the ponies I was only in it
02:10:16 for the money baby I was only in it for the clout
02:10:18 I was just faking the whole time
02:10:22 oh boy
02:10:24 okay next next one is called
02:10:26 the jelly trials
02:10:28 three two one go
02:10:30 hi PCP
02:10:32 jelly beaner here
02:10:34 I wanted to make a clarification
02:10:36 on the quote unquote
02:10:38 Ben cord raid has this been referred to
02:10:40 I was not making
02:10:42 multiple alts
02:10:44 and repeatedly going into the server
02:10:46 and also
02:10:48 the speed runs the first one was
02:10:50 Eleazar the editor of the PCP
02:10:52 and the second one was
02:10:54 Dune
02:10:56 full disavow
02:10:58 they're awful people stay away from them
02:11:00 agreed
02:11:02 I don't know who I don't know who made what
02:11:04 account I don't know who made what account
02:11:06 was there a whole thing
02:11:08 there was a whole yeah there was a whole thing I had
02:11:10 oh you were in the bathroom
02:11:12 yeah I had to shut my discord
02:11:14 not shut it down I had to lock it down and delete
02:11:16 all the invites because people
02:11:18 I don't know I don't know who did what
02:11:20 I don't know which individual
02:11:22 said what or spammed what
02:11:24 made accounts named what or whatever
02:11:26 but people kept doing
02:11:28 it
02:11:30 and it was it was despicable
02:11:32 it was disgusting I had to
02:11:34 I had to shut down all the invites and lock my server
02:11:36 down to stop it
02:11:38 um cringe
02:11:40 maybe maybe you had
02:11:42 it's I it's a funny
02:11:44 concept it's a funny concept
02:11:46 and if you had the best of intentions
02:11:48 when you
02:11:50 made the speed run
02:11:52 joke I get it
02:11:54 I'm not mad about that
02:11:56 I am I am a little upset about
02:11:58 the lengths to which it was taken but I understand
02:12:00 everyone is only responsible
02:12:02 for their own actions
02:12:04 and I don't know who did what so I can't really
02:12:06 assign blame to anyone in particular
02:12:08 um I did blow up a jelly beaner
02:12:10 in the discord about
02:12:12 this because I thought it was like
02:12:14 entirely his thing I'm sure it wasn't
02:12:16 entirely him doing it though
02:12:18 in hindsight so whoops
02:12:20 um but yeah
02:12:22 game's over discord's locked down
02:12:24 get fucked everybody
02:12:26 um next voicemail is called
02:12:28 uh it's an arrow it's a left
02:12:30 arrow okay
02:12:32 three two one go
02:12:34 the left
02:12:36 yes that's the
02:12:38 left agreed
02:12:40 next voicemail is called
02:12:42 mozilla fennekin plural
02:12:44 three two one go
02:12:46 hey
02:12:48 sorry about the mess
02:12:52 everyone knows that the voicemails are the main
02:12:54 content of the podcast so
02:12:56 why do I do a live episode with live colleagues
02:12:58 would be an interesting change of the form
02:13:00 for now anyway gotta go
02:13:02 I have a meeting with a mind switch
02:13:04 so why does that have to do with
02:13:06 understanding what you're saying
02:13:08 I got it um I mean
02:13:10 I mean we could
02:13:12 yeah I mean we've done we did live
02:13:14 PCPs at radcons
02:13:16 before so it's not like we've never done one
02:13:18 I think it's just the call in
02:13:20 feature we would need to
02:13:22 have a discord server for it oh wait
02:13:24 no we didn't do that in redcon
02:13:26 for we had people
02:13:28 we had super chats
02:13:30 we had super chats
02:13:32 yeah which are kind of the same
02:13:34 um
02:13:36 maybe
02:13:38 I don't know we'd have to set up
02:13:40 like a discord server we couldn't do it through
02:13:42 wait we did all oops all guests
02:13:44 I think that's
02:13:46 that was something wasn't it
02:13:48 yeah like a ton of people
02:13:50 it's not yeah I mean it's not exactly
02:13:52 um
02:13:54 live call ins
02:13:56 but it's something
02:13:58 I guess I guess the thing would be
02:14:00 is that the show would have to be live
02:14:02 and then we would do like call ins
02:14:04 this person people would have had to listen
02:14:06 to what we were talking about to have a relevant thing
02:14:08 to say about it mozilla fennekin
02:14:10 mozilla fennekin just wants to turn the
02:14:12 PCP into void gazers because
02:14:14 they do live call ins
02:14:16 um
02:14:18 and uh I don't
02:14:20 I have in the
02:14:22 I haven't found them very I haven't found them very
02:14:24 interesting live call ins
02:14:26 the call just goes on and on and on I like
02:14:28 that they're pre called so that they're like
02:14:30 the person just says what they need to
02:14:32 say and then they're done I don't need to have
02:14:34 a whole back and forth with every fucking
02:14:36 one of you freaks
02:14:38 um
02:14:40 okay yeah
02:14:42 sounds like a lot of work
02:14:44 uh next one is called
02:14:46 bass joker five
02:14:48 oh boy god I can't I can't
02:14:50 fucking wait three two one
02:14:52 go you know
02:14:54 Batman
02:14:56 you say that you're a master
02:14:58 in jiu jitsu
02:15:00 but I have to wonder
02:15:02 are you a master in
02:15:04 push it soon
02:15:06 that uh
02:15:08 um
02:15:10 I don't know joker
02:15:12 I don't know about that one I feel
02:15:14 I'm not laughing that one's a little
02:15:16 I'm not I'm not no that one didn't hit
02:15:18 that one didn't hit query he's lost
02:15:20 his luster oh no he's his first
02:15:22 ever his first ever flop
02:15:24 bass joker's impeccable
02:15:26 win streak
02:15:28 has been uh has been
02:15:30 sully I think it was a little
02:15:32 a little too strange because Batman
02:15:34 doesn't do jiu jitsu it is not a thing
02:15:36 he does
02:15:38 that there's no there's no like it's
02:15:40 true like there's no aspect of that
02:15:42 it's just like what rhymes with
02:15:44 shit and poo and the joker
02:15:46 says it
02:15:48 I I
02:15:50 I I bet in at least
02:15:52 one uh story
02:15:54 somewhere references made
02:15:56 to Batman knowing jiu jitsu because he is
02:15:58 like a martial artist you know okay
02:16:00 he grab he grapples but that
02:16:02 that would be more
02:16:04 um uh what's the word
02:16:06 hidden
02:16:08 knowledge what's the word for that
02:16:10 hidden hidden power obscure
02:16:12 uh the the
02:16:14 hmm
02:16:16 didn't he well I mean I guess
02:16:18 in in dark night I don't know
02:16:20 if they talk about jiu jitsu specifically
02:16:22 well I know about Batman is that he
02:16:24 punches guys and he's
02:16:26 Batman and that's all I know
02:16:28 those are two important facts
02:16:30 about Batman
02:16:32 uh okay
02:16:34 the next one is called
02:16:36 be autism opinion
02:16:38 meh 3 2
02:16:40 1 go
02:16:42 hi um I'm very very sorry
02:16:44 um I'm I'm the DS guy I'm
02:16:46 very sorry that I said I didn't care
02:16:48 about B but now I kind of care because I just
02:16:50 got to the autism debate and here's my here's
02:16:52 my two cents um okay I feel
02:16:54 like B has kind of
02:16:56 like
02:16:58 taken the meme too far
02:17:00 how do I even explain
02:17:02 I feel like I feel like she's like
02:17:04 uh she's
02:17:06 she's been in like autism
02:17:08 meme culture for so long that it kind of
02:17:10 like became reality
02:17:12 like yeah I'm pretty sure she's undiagnosed
02:17:14 if she is diagnosed and like I'm just stupid
02:17:16 I'm just like an idiot I'm pretty sure she's
02:17:18 undiagnosed it just feels like she's
02:17:20 like exhibiting the things
02:17:22 that like she knows I don't know maybe
02:17:24 this is really insulting no if it is
02:17:26 then I agree
02:17:28 sorry
02:17:30 sorry
02:17:32 this is
02:17:36 no I
02:17:38 I don't know I can't read minds
02:17:40 I can't see into B's
02:17:42 thoughts or anything
02:17:44 I mean are they saying like
02:17:46 potentially the
02:17:48 she's playing up
02:17:50 autism because I feel like
02:17:52 yeah I
02:17:54 that's the feeling I get is that she is that
02:17:56 she believes is that she believes
02:17:58 in it
02:18:00 she believes that her undiagnosed
02:18:02 autism is such a real
02:18:04 thing that she like makes it real
02:18:06 in her own mind
02:18:08 at least by sort of acting in a way
02:18:10 that is like I don't know
02:18:12 weird in a way that I think
02:18:14 reinforces the idea
02:18:16 that she's autistic or something
02:18:18 I don't see evidence for that
02:18:20 but I can see why you would think
02:18:22 that's possible
02:18:24 I can't point to any like
02:18:26 there's the proof there's when she did it
02:18:28 it's just you can't know
02:18:30 when I think about that I think
02:18:32 like that sounds right
02:18:34 that sounds accurate
02:18:36 but I can't prove it
02:18:38 damn
02:18:40 I can't prove anything
02:18:42 in particular but like
02:18:46 the word neurodivergent
02:18:48 is vague enough
02:18:50 that I feel like it fits
02:18:52 like Digi is not
02:18:54 totally normal
02:18:56 in the way she interacts
02:18:58 nobody's totally normal
02:19:00 we had this conversation before
02:19:02 I know I know but like
02:19:04 you can't
02:19:06 you can't just say like
02:19:08 I'm just pushing back on the idea that she's faking it
02:19:10 like how could she be faking
02:19:12 like being into this
02:19:14 it's more subtle than just faking
02:19:16 that's why I'm not sure
02:19:18 what I'm talking about here
02:19:20 I think
02:19:22 what I'm extrapolating from this voicemail
02:19:24 is it's sort of like a self
02:19:26 sort of like a self fulfilling
02:19:28 kind of like thought process
02:19:30 wherein
02:19:32 a belief
02:19:34 a belief or a desire
02:19:36 or something
02:19:38 to have a certain condition
02:19:40 creates an incentive to act
02:19:42 in a way that would
02:19:44 suggest that it's real
02:19:46 and it's sort of like
02:19:48 auto hypnosis kind of thing
02:19:50 I don't know
02:19:54 I don't know
02:19:56 you can't just be like oh this person acts weird
02:19:58 this person is
02:20:00 different
02:20:02 hence neurodivergent
02:20:04 I mean
02:20:06 that's like
02:20:08 there could be any number of reasons
02:20:10 a person could have
02:20:12 a perfectly normal
02:20:14 neurology
02:20:16 bizarrely
02:20:18 I don't know because they've been
02:20:20 conditioned
02:20:22 I guess I just don't know what is the end
02:20:24 goal of understanding this
02:20:26 like if it turns out that
02:20:28 this is true
02:20:30 what would Trixie need to do
02:20:32 or is there anything you would have her do
02:20:34 differently
02:20:36 well I would try to act more normal
02:20:38 like I don't know
02:20:40 no I would just refrain
02:20:42 I would just refrain from
02:20:44 refrain from
02:20:46 giving
02:20:48 diagnoses
02:20:50 that you have no
02:20:52 expertise or basis for
02:20:54 for
02:20:56 giving
02:20:58 that's it
02:21:00 I mean I don't know
02:21:02 I can agree with the diagnosis thing
02:21:04 yeah okay
02:21:06 thank you for the voicemail
02:21:08 next one is called
02:21:10 Fena 3 2 1
02:21:12 also thank you for
02:21:14 ragging on Fena I fucking hate Fena
02:21:16 I fucking hate Fena more than I hate most things
02:21:18 in the world I fucking hate Fena
02:21:20 I fucking hate Fena
02:21:22 I hate Fena I hate him
02:21:24 I hate his cartoons I hate him I hate the guy
02:21:26 so thank you
02:21:28 I mean yeah
02:21:30 I mean thank Dan Olson
02:21:32 I guess for like
02:21:34 I mean I guess I had seen
02:21:36 I had watched the jar
02:21:38 I hope I'm not repeating myself
02:21:40 I had watched the jar podcast
02:21:42 about the Doug Walker
02:21:44 wall thing so I had seen the cartoons before
02:21:46 they don't really
02:21:48 talk as much about
02:21:50 they don't criticize the animation as much
02:21:52 as like Doug does or as Dan did
02:21:54 but
02:21:56 yeah no it was when Discount Gumshoe
02:21:58 was like there's more to this whole
02:22:00 he directed my attention to the channel
02:22:02 itself and I just went and I looked at it
02:22:04 and like the more I looked at it
02:22:06 the more I'm like
02:22:08 this is this is bad and it's uncanny
02:22:10 and it's like
02:22:12 and it's fucked up and I
02:22:14 and I hate looking at it
02:22:16 and I don't know
02:22:18 you're
02:22:20 I hope
02:22:22 I would hope that most people can see it
02:22:24 I
02:22:26 I think there's a
02:22:28 certain level of like polish
02:22:30 there's a certain level of polish on the way
02:22:32 that it looks that like at first glance
02:22:34 I think a lot of people's
02:22:36 gut reaction is to think that it is like
02:22:38 professional it has a certain
02:22:40 veneer of professionalness to the way it looks
02:22:42 but like the more you
02:22:44 look at it the more you start to be like
02:22:46 something's off something is
02:22:48 weird and I can't quite put my finger on it
02:22:50 something's bugging me about the way the stuff
02:22:52 looks and then of course like
02:22:54 the dialogue is all is awful
02:22:56 you know of course
02:22:58 that's
02:23:00 anyone should be able to see that
02:23:02 unless you're like an unironic Doug
02:23:04 Walker fan in the year of our lord
02:23:06 2021
02:23:08 anyway
02:23:10 fan is really funny fan is really
02:23:12 very good
02:23:14 love it next one is called
02:23:16 welcome to the underwater world what kind of
02:23:18 creature are you
02:23:20 three two one go
02:23:34 oh god
02:23:52 has this something from before
02:24:04 I
02:24:10 be a dramatic organ
02:24:14 I mean
02:24:16 if I could choose one I would choose
02:24:18 I mean probably something
02:24:20 that lives a really long time and has few natural
02:24:22 predators like blue whale
02:24:24 or something I'd be a brain eating
02:24:26 amoeba
02:24:28 awesome
02:24:30 I would be a
02:24:32 a krill a single krill
02:24:34 in a in a cloud
02:24:36 or a yeah
02:24:38 I've always loved sharks
02:24:40 so sharks are cool
02:24:42 I really
02:24:44 like
02:24:46 I do really like Nautilus's
02:24:48 just because they're so like weird looking
02:24:50 like you look right at them and you're like what is
02:24:52 going on with this thing like what
02:24:54 why is it shaped like that
02:24:56 so I'm tempted to say Nautilus
02:24:58 Nautilus
02:25:00 yeah
02:25:02 I mean
02:25:04 oh yeah yeah
02:25:06 the thing that's like a pokemon is based
02:25:08 off it
02:25:10 yes um
02:25:12 which I think so
02:25:14 I don't remember which pokemon
02:25:16 uh yeah
02:25:18 wait
02:25:20 which fucking pokemon is it
02:25:22 it's got like a oh god I don't
02:25:26 just type in Nautilus pokemon
02:25:28 yeah that's shellmet I think
02:25:30 a little bit or
02:25:32 no
02:25:34 it's a little cross between shellmet
02:25:36 and omenite
02:25:38 no it's not no not
02:25:40 shellmet shellmet is a bug omenite
02:25:42 yeah yeah omenite is
02:25:44 I mean omenite is more of a
02:25:48 does a Nautilus have a shell
02:25:50 I think it's that hard back
02:25:52 thing is like the exoskeleton shell
02:25:54 thing
02:25:56 like he grows it
02:25:58 no yeah it is
02:26:00 uh yeah
02:26:02 no omenite is basically a Nautilus
02:26:04 you're right
02:26:06 I like these but
02:26:08 I think they're probably like not
02:26:10 good to be
02:26:12 like they don't do anything and they probably don't live very
02:26:14 long and they probably are
02:26:16 easy prey they look
02:26:18 they look pretty useless
02:26:20 no I'd probably go with a blue whale
02:26:22 or whatever kind of whale lives the longest
02:26:24 wait I would be
02:26:26 the funny cute like
02:26:28 youtube thumbnail clickbait
02:26:30 cute
02:26:32 squid or octopus these funny old guys
02:26:34 um which ones

02:30:30 it's a little creepy yeah
02:30:32 it's a little spooky if you want to get spooked
02:30:38 where was I
02:30:40 oh yes um the next yeah
02:30:42 blue whale blue whale for me
02:30:44 next one is
02:30:46 alt-right propaganda
02:30:48 this is exciting three two one
02:30:50 go
02:30:52 Howdy
02:30:54 about the shoplifting thing
02:30:56 I understand you know
02:30:58 if you shoplift from Walmart
02:31:00 right I know what he gets hurt
02:31:02 it's a victim who's crying
02:31:04 however I don't know
02:31:06 if this is just a southern thing
02:31:08 but
02:31:10 people who work retail
02:31:12 are held responsible for the
02:31:14 shoplifting so even even
02:31:16 Walmart especially in say
02:31:18 gas stations
02:31:20 I worked at a Walmart for
02:31:22 a while and
02:31:24 there was a
02:31:26 shoplifting epidemic
02:31:28 on the level of Ben St. walking in
02:31:30 to a Walmart
02:31:32 and I got fired because I did not
02:31:34 see people shoplifting
02:31:36 but they figured it out
02:31:38 victimless crime
02:31:40 more like victim is dying
02:31:42 what
02:31:44 I don't get it um
02:31:46 okay
02:31:48 I
02:31:50 am like
02:31:52 I don't know how fucking gas stations run their business
02:31:54 right
02:31:56 but like
02:31:58 I am pretty sure
02:32:00 I am pretty sure that that is should be
02:32:02 is and should be like a labor violation
02:32:04 I don't think
02:32:06 I mean maybe people do it
02:32:08 but I don't think you're legally allowed
02:32:10 to like fire your employees
02:32:12 because like
02:32:14 a shoplifter stole something
02:32:16 well I can
02:32:18 believe that it's not legally allowed
02:32:20 but I can also believe that they could
02:32:22 come up with some other reason
02:32:24 to get rid of them
02:32:26 if they felt like they were slacking
02:32:28 during their shift
02:32:30 they've got stolen
02:32:32 like I can imagine it also does happen
02:32:34 why would I mean
02:32:36 why would you think
02:32:38 I mean is the I mean
02:32:40 if you're a boss I guess you'd be like
02:32:42 hmm my employees
02:32:44 are too lax
02:32:46 about this shoplifting thing I need
02:32:48 to hire a new team
02:32:50 that is like
02:32:52 gonna give it a more of 110%
02:32:56 that's gonna be like more
02:32:58 active about preventing shoplifting
02:33:00 or something I don't know
02:33:02 maybe
02:33:04 it probably does happen
02:33:06 I'm sure it's happened before
02:33:08 but it's just
02:33:10 it's just like a doomed I mean
02:33:12 the problem there is the boss
02:33:14 the problem there is not the shoplifter
02:33:16 the problem is the boss who thinks that they can
02:33:18 just cycle through employees
02:33:20 and hire people to do
02:33:22 work
02:33:24 outside of their pay grade
02:33:26 and IE
02:33:28 apprehending shoplifters
02:33:30 like that's not in the job description
02:33:32 of like a Walmart floor employee
02:33:34 and it shouldn't be expected of them
02:33:36 so I understand
02:33:38 I understand that this consequence
02:33:40 might occur
02:33:42 but I would I mean I would put the blame
02:33:44 at the boss's feet
02:33:46 not the shoplifter
02:33:48 yeah
02:33:50 there's like there's a greater evil here
02:33:52 next
02:33:54 this mail is called
02:33:56 hypotheticals
02:33:58 3, 2, 1, go
02:34:00 you know I've been listening to the
02:34:02 procrastinators podcast for a while now
02:34:04 and Ben's saint guy is always
02:34:06 going on about these hypotheticals
02:34:08 well
02:34:10 Ben, what if I hypothetically
02:34:12 put my dick in your ass
02:34:14 huh
02:34:16 would you come
02:34:20 would you? yeah
02:34:22 I guess
02:34:24 I guess
02:34:26 that's how it works right
02:34:28 the dick touches the prostate
02:34:30 and that's and game over

02:35:00 voicemails
02:35:02 and we've got some shocking
02:35:04 some shocking findings Diane

02:37:10 that the brony lecture was going to be
02:37:12 the story of how you guys became friends
02:37:14 partially was that like
02:37:16 actually a big part of it
02:37:18 or is it just you guys became friends through brownies
02:37:20 it partially touches on the formation
02:37:22 of the horses that's something I've always
02:37:24 been kind of curious about
02:37:26 and would love to hear the details of that
02:37:28 so like
02:37:30 do that as like a topic
02:37:32 kind of thing please
02:37:34 we've talked about this
02:37:36 also
02:37:38 I don't remember
02:37:40 what my other question was
02:37:42 yeah we've definitely talked
02:37:44 about the formation of
02:37:46 our stupid group
02:37:48 before multiple times
02:37:50 the lecture
02:37:52 it talked about like the formation of
02:37:54 the um
02:37:56 the brony analysis community
02:37:58 in general but you know special
02:38:00 emphasis was placed on the horseshoe crew
02:38:02 and us forming the pcp
02:38:04 because that was a whole you know obviously
02:38:06 she was like more privy to that and that was
02:38:08 central to her experience of it
02:38:10 so yeah it does go into that
02:38:12 if you don't know analysis community
02:38:14 uh there was there was
02:38:16 Trixie
02:38:18 um and I think
02:38:20 Jesse had made drowning in horse shoes
02:38:22 or or like a drowning in footwear
02:38:24 video where he dressed up as
02:38:26 Colt Corona
02:38:28 for that one thing
02:38:30 um Tommy Oliver
02:38:32 well they were they were all
02:38:34 Tommy and Trixie
02:38:36 were like the first
02:38:38 of our group doing it
02:38:40 it became famous and then it was
02:38:42 uh t-bap give and take
02:38:44 uh drowning in horseshoes
02:38:46 came up around season 4
02:38:48 at the same time
02:38:50 making similar sort of an analytical
02:38:52 content
02:38:54 we noticed each other we all preferred
02:38:56 each other's content over
02:38:58 like the rest of the community
02:39:00 we all had we all had the same
02:39:02 we all like had an attitude
02:39:04 about it where we didn't take it too seriously
02:39:06 and yeah we were
02:39:08 like we were fucking around and we were
02:39:10 silly and we were self-aware and a lot
02:39:12 of the other in the brony community
02:39:14 of the analysis community were like
02:39:16 not as
02:39:18 self-aware or just generally
02:39:20 more brony
02:39:22 than man
02:39:24 more brony than me yeah yeah yeah yeah
02:39:26 so so we
02:39:28 we just you know
02:39:30 senses of humor were like ah that's
02:39:32 you know this guy's got funny jokes in their
02:39:34 video mm-hmm something like
02:39:36 that yeah that's that's the that's the
02:39:38 short version um
02:39:40 next voicemail is called strong
02:39:42 opinions 3 2 1
02:39:44 go oh
02:39:46 my other question was do you
02:39:48 have any strong opinions
02:39:50 on goat sea I was inspired
02:39:52 by the gay and the asshole guy
02:39:54 I love it
02:39:56 it's great and it's it's it's
02:39:58 it's uh we should have that guy on the
02:40:00 pcp
02:40:02 next voicemail is called Ben
02:40:04 read one piece please 3 2 1
02:40:06 go
02:40:14 okay great
02:40:16 well now I'll never read one piece just

02:40:22 next one is called to those owed
02:40:24 raise 3 2 1 go
02:40:28 so this is a message that one
02:40:30 guy had told Ben not to tell Trixie
02:40:32 that he's mad at her about not getting his
02:40:34 blue rays mm I just gotta say dude
02:40:36 you fucking should be mad and you should let
02:40:38 it be known that you're mad
02:40:40 you put down a shit ton of money to make these
02:40:42 blue rays happen I agree and now she's going
02:40:44 around calling you entitled for
02:40:46 wanting the fucking it's a completely
02:40:48 legitimate thing to be upset about she shouldn't
02:40:50 just get away with it you shouldn't let her
02:40:52 off the hook because she's quote-unquote
02:40:54 going through a lot
02:40:56 Trixie is a woman who is almost
02:40:58 fucking 30 she should be
02:41:00 able to fucking handle it
02:41:02 um
02:41:04 fucking don't simp for her demand
02:41:06 your fucking blue rays or demand your money back
02:41:08 I love you voice voice grail
02:41:10 voice grail
02:41:12 I will say true
02:41:14 to that I don't know about voice grail
02:41:16 I that that I don't
02:41:18 know if that guy who
02:41:20 messaged me said that like
02:41:22 it was because Trixie's going through a
02:41:24 lot but like yeah I
02:41:26 have seen some people share the sentiment of
02:41:28 like oh don't criticize Trixie
02:41:30 she's going through a lot she's transitioning
02:41:32 and like yeah true
02:41:34 on the one hand true but on the other hand that
02:41:36 kind of stuff is like that's your fucking
02:41:38 responsibility like
02:41:40 it's you're responsible for your own
02:41:42 shit like if you if you made
02:41:44 a if you made a promise
02:41:46 or an agreement beforehand the fact that
02:41:48 like oh you've you've discovered
02:41:50 that you're trans and you're going through that doesn't
02:41:52 like alleviate any of that at all
02:41:54 yeah like it's not it's not trans related
02:41:56 what like it's it's not
02:41:58 a trans related thing if it's like
02:42:00 oh I promised I would make a video
02:42:02 saying I am a man and now I'm trans
02:42:04 and I don't want to release that and just like
02:42:06 I you know what I don't worry about
02:42:08 it um that's a strange promise to
02:42:10 to have but like
02:42:12 trans doesn't mean your promises
02:42:14 other than like other things
02:42:16 don't need to be
02:42:18 uh yeah honored you know
02:42:20 they don't they don't
02:42:22 it's not like
02:42:24 yeah it doesn't
02:42:26 absolve you of doing work
02:42:28 yes okay
02:42:30 yeah all right I think that's
02:42:32 I think that's
02:42:34 pretty clear
02:42:36 uh okay next one is called
02:42:38 I forgot the thing
02:42:40 three two one go
02:42:42 oh and I forgot to add
02:42:44 PCP forever Tom will never die
02:42:46 call me back
02:42:48 PCP forever
02:42:50 Tom will never die
02:42:52 uh
02:42:54 yeah Tom will outlast us all
02:42:56 it's it's it's canon
02:42:58 next one is called
02:43:00 Bleachfan17
02:43:02 three two one go
02:43:14 is this
02:43:16 do you recognize this
02:43:18 it's a song from the OST
02:43:20 yeah
02:43:22 okay
02:43:24 if it rusts
02:43:26 it can never be trusted
02:43:28 if its owner fails to control it
02:43:30 it will cut him
02:43:32 yes pride is
02:43:34 like a blade
02:43:36 leech volume 8
02:43:38 the blade and me
02:43:40 wow
02:43:42 wow
02:43:44 that's so deep
02:43:46 it's true though
02:43:48 just like
02:43:50 if it rusts
02:43:52 it's not true I disagree
02:43:54 because
02:43:56 you know what can rust
02:43:58 is iron
02:44:00 the iron
02:44:02 the weight on the bar
02:44:04 the weight on the bar in the
02:44:06 squat rack that can rust
02:44:08 but you can always trust the iron
02:44:10 the iron never lies to you
02:44:12 god I gotta start working out again
02:44:14 I'm so fucking pathetic
02:44:16 I'm such a fucking pathetic little man baby
02:44:18 yep with my little body
02:44:20 that only moves normal amounts of
02:44:22 true true
02:44:24 um
02:44:26 it's it's time
02:44:28 it's warm again I can go back
02:44:30 to my basement without suffering
02:44:32 next voicemail is called
02:44:34 little Christians running to
02:44:36 megalovania
02:44:38 one go
02:44:40 so my my my dad
02:44:42 is a gym teacher
02:44:44 at a small christian school
02:44:46 and
02:44:48 for the for running for
02:44:50 he has music play right
02:44:52 and so then he has like you know
02:44:54 christian rock whatever
02:44:56 he thinks of my childhood
02:44:58 and uses that as a basis for what music to play
02:45:00 so like you'll hear like
02:45:02 smooth mcgroove legend of
02:45:04 zelda tracks going on
02:45:06 you'll hear like children running to the
02:45:08 fairy fountain theme
02:45:10 it kind of echoes through the school a little
02:45:12 and not only that
02:45:14 but I thought this was a
02:45:16 this was my time snatch opportunity
02:45:18 I told him
02:45:20 to use megalovania
02:45:22 and it happened
02:45:24 in this small christian school
02:45:26 on almost a daily
02:45:28 basis you can hear megalovania
02:45:30 playing through the halls
02:45:32 as as as children
02:45:34 from from pre-k
02:45:36 to senior
02:45:38 in high school and they must know
02:45:40 they must know what it is to run to megalovania
02:45:46 things can look bad in the world but
02:45:48 this shows that there can be true happiness
02:45:52 unfathomably based
02:45:54 unfathomably incredibly based
02:45:56 god levels of base right there
02:46:00 a lot of those kids must know what the song
02:46:02 is
02:46:04 definitely some of the older kids
02:46:06 if it's just children
02:46:08 who are going to have memories of that song
02:46:10 and they will eventually discover it
02:46:12 it would be way funnier
02:46:14 if it's like little kids
02:46:18 if it's like teenagers
02:46:20 I think a lot of them would be like
02:46:22 why is the gym teacher playing the
02:46:24 undertale soundtrack
02:46:28 so good
02:46:30 okay next one is called
02:46:32 fiddle me dittle baby
02:46:34 three two one go
02:46:38 konnichiwa
02:46:40 this is samuraisama
02:46:42 the mighty
02:46:44 aryancy
02:46:46 kawasaki samurai
02:46:48 kiyoto ninja
02:46:50 and mistery tea
02:46:52 prepare
02:46:54 first attack
02:46:56 on nobeno sento san
02:46:58 traitor
02:47:00 of nipo
02:47:02 we plan to battle
02:47:04 proto
02:47:06 write down
02:47:08 on noscroll
02:47:10 then nobeno sento san
02:47:12 steal
02:47:14 battle scroll
02:47:16 fuck you
02:47:18 return the samurai
02:47:20 ninja tea
02:47:22 battle scroll
02:47:24 okay until next time
02:47:26 sayonara
02:47:28 were they going to battle
02:47:30 each other
02:47:32 or were they all going
02:47:34 I think they're saying that you stole
02:47:36 mister tea's battle scroll
02:47:38 they wrote
02:47:40 a battle plan
02:47:42 on a scroll
02:47:44 and
02:47:46 so okay
02:47:48 but I stole the scroll
02:47:50 before they were all in alliance
02:47:52 against me because
02:47:54 they have allied against me because I stole the scroll
02:47:56 so when they wrote the battle
02:47:58 plan they were enemies
02:48:00 so they must have been
02:48:02 it must be battle plans for them to battle
02:48:04 each other
02:48:06 or you like individually
02:48:08 no no because I was in alliance
02:48:10 I was they trusted me back then
02:48:12 this is only when it was stolen
02:48:14 only once it was stolen that everything changed
02:48:16 they desperately want me to return the scroll
02:48:18 they've allied with each other
02:48:20 so that I'll return the scroll so they can fight each other again
02:48:22 no I can't
02:48:24 I have to keep it to protect
02:48:26 I have to protect them from themselves
02:48:28 I'm saving lives here
02:48:30 I see
02:48:32 hmm
02:48:34 the plan has backfired
02:48:36 I'm more resolute in my scroll hoarding than ever
02:48:38 next voicemail
02:48:40 I think it's the last one
02:48:42 is called slash everybody
02:48:44 slash wants to rule the world
02:48:46 three two one go
02:48:49 on the previous episode of the podcast
02:48:51 Ben and Gimper arguing on
02:48:53 DG's self-diagnosed autism
02:48:56 and
02:48:58 the conclusion they all came to
02:49:00 was essentially that
02:49:02 if a metal professional did not
02:49:04 diagnose
02:49:06 then at best it can be called
02:49:08 in the question of what it is
02:49:10 of that diagnosis compromise is the word y'all used
02:49:12 and I as a transphobic
02:49:14 alt-right fucker
02:49:16 I have to ask
02:49:18 can this not be applied to both
02:49:20 and DG's transness
02:49:22 I can't speak
02:49:24 for give and take
02:49:26 but I feel as if
02:49:28 because DG had not sought therapy
02:49:30 or anything involving her issues
02:49:32 I wonder if
02:49:34 there's another
02:49:36 her gender dysphoria
02:49:38 is not valid because
02:49:40 not a medical professional
02:49:43 the
02:49:45 being trans is not a
02:49:47 being trans is not a diagnosis
02:49:49 it is not a disease
02:49:51 it is not like a medical
02:49:53 like
02:49:55 issue that is like treatable
02:49:57 it's like gayness
02:49:59 like you can't
02:50:01 it's not like a disability to be gay
02:50:03 it's just sort of silly
02:50:05 it's like being gay
02:50:07 yeah no you can't
02:50:09 you can't be diagnosed as trans
02:50:11 being trans is something you
02:50:13 I guess
02:50:15 decide that you are
02:50:17 they do annoyingly and a lot of institutions
02:50:19 have like
02:50:21 people to diagnose transness
02:50:23 so that you can get
02:50:25 like the
02:50:27 hormones that you would need to transition
02:50:29 because a lot of
02:50:31 medical institutions are a little
02:50:33 I don't know
02:50:35 they're unsure about it and they haven't updated in a long time
02:50:37 even though the medicine
02:50:39 the knowledge is there
02:50:41 but it's just like the bigger
02:50:43 not all the doctors know
02:50:45 it's just only specialists do
02:50:47 and you always
02:50:49 haven't caught up yet
02:50:51 okay
02:50:53 correct me if I'm wrong
02:50:55 gender dysphoria
02:50:57 gender dysphoria is literally
02:50:59 just that you feel bad
02:51:01 about your gender
02:51:03 basically
02:51:05 I'm not like an expert
02:51:07 okay
02:51:09 I think
02:51:11 someone can correct me if I'm wrong
02:51:13 it's not like autism
02:51:15 you can diagnose yourself with gender dysphoria
02:51:17 because the only criteria for having it
02:51:19 is do you feel bad
02:51:21 and if you do then that's gender dysphoria
02:51:23 right?
02:51:25 I think so
02:51:27 essentially yes
02:51:31 I want
02:51:33 I hope that this question
02:51:35 is asked in good faith
02:51:37 I mean
02:51:39 I think the alt-right
02:51:41 maybe would be exaggerated
02:51:43 a little bit but not too far off the mark
02:51:45 so I'm a little
02:51:47 little sus about this guy
02:51:49 I'm open to discussing
02:51:51 this if people are genuinely curious
02:51:53 because
02:51:55 there's a lot of stupid
02:51:57 assumptions made about
02:51:59 being trans
02:52:01 and it's like
02:52:03 it's not a
02:52:05 it's not untrue
02:52:07 if it's not diagnosed
02:52:09 gender
02:52:11 is a
02:52:13 you can't diagnose someone's gender
02:52:15 it just doesn't make sense
02:52:17 gender is a thing that you
02:52:19 choose
02:52:21 or that you choose to be
02:52:23 or you
02:52:25 yeah right
02:52:27 gender is a role that you
02:52:29 choose to accept
02:52:31 society
02:52:33 that you live in
02:52:35 dictates what
02:52:37 men do and women do
02:52:39 and there's gender signifiers
02:52:41 that you can
02:52:43 ascribe to
02:52:45 and some you might not
02:52:47 mix and match you can do what you like
02:52:49 and gender
02:52:51 dysphoria is where
02:52:53 the gender that you are told to be
02:52:57 usually just based on your birth sex
02:52:59 is something that you don't
02:53:01 want to do
02:53:03 and you want to do instead do
02:53:05 something else or the exact opposite
02:53:07 you know the other gender
02:53:09 in the society
02:53:11 in which you live
02:53:13 the gender part of it
02:53:15 is based a lot
02:53:17 needs a lot of context
02:53:19 and because of that it's not like a brain
02:53:21 thing
02:53:23 I mean it's a problem
02:53:25 that you feel
02:53:27 that you don't
02:53:29 feel comfortable
02:53:31 doing specific things
02:53:33 but like the exact science of it
02:53:35 I'm not entirely sure
02:53:37 but you can tell when you're upset
02:53:41 you can tell when you're upset
02:53:43 I think it's easier to tell when you're upset
02:53:45 than it is to tell whether or not you're autistic
02:53:49 but you know honestly I'm not even sure
02:53:53 I don't think
02:53:55 somebody experimenting with their gender
02:53:57 is like an invalid thing to do
02:53:59 whether or not like if there's
02:54:01 some medical
02:54:03 diagnosis that is like
02:54:05 yes you have gender dysmorphia
02:54:07 or gender dysphoria or whatever
02:54:09 I don't think it's wrong for anyone who doesn't
02:54:11 have that to try to do any
02:54:13 gender stuff if they feel like it
02:54:15 there's like no reason for it to
02:54:17 be considered wrong
02:54:19 to not be diagnosed
02:54:21 for that
02:54:23 to do whatever you like regardless of
02:54:25 whatever
02:54:27 again I'll give this guy the benefit
02:54:29 of the doubt that he asks his question in good faith
02:54:31 but this is the same kind of
02:54:33 reasoning that you can use
02:54:35 to invalidate trans
02:54:37 people's gender when you say
02:54:39 oh but you weren't diagnosed
02:54:41 with dysphoria
02:54:43 you need a doctor's diagnosis
02:54:45 to prove
02:54:47 that you have dysphoria
02:54:49 you can't prove that you have dysphoria
02:54:51 it's like do you feel bad
02:54:53 and like I don't know to be like
02:54:55 oh no you don't have a real gender dysphoria
02:54:57 it's like well what are you saying
02:54:59 anybody who goes around saying
02:55:01 I'm saying I feel bad
02:55:03 and you're saying no you don't
02:55:05 you can't prove it you can't prove that you feel bad
02:55:07 it's like well you're right
02:55:09 I can't
02:55:11 anyone going around like deliberately
02:55:13 dead naming someone because they haven't got
02:55:15 a medical note for them from their doctor
02:55:17 saying I should
02:55:19 treat you the way you want to be treated
02:55:21 I should not upset you
02:55:23 like that's stupid
02:55:25 it's sort of equivalent of saying
02:55:29 please don't annoy me
02:55:31 could you stop being really mean to me
02:55:33 and somebody saying
02:55:35 well I mean the police haven't told me that I can't
02:55:37 be annoying there's not a law against it
02:55:39 shut the fuck up
02:55:41 you're a piece of shit
02:55:43 the word for this is trans
02:55:45 medicalism
02:55:47 and it is a kind of stealth
02:55:49 it is a kind of stealth transphobia
02:55:51 that disguises itself
02:55:53 as an interest
02:55:55 it disguises itself
02:55:57 as an interest in facts
02:55:59 over feelings
02:56:01 well
02:56:03 sorry to use a confusing word just
02:56:05 but it misdiagnoses
02:56:07 the issue
02:56:09 by assuming that gender is a
02:56:11 medical condition
02:56:13 which it is not
02:56:15 it's far more
02:56:17 it's a social construct
02:56:19 well it's a social
02:56:21 it's a social condition
02:56:23 not a medical one
02:56:25 sure right
02:56:27 treat me please so that I don't
02:56:29 feel terrible please don't
02:56:31 bully me
02:56:33 please treat me
02:56:35 with respect is not like
02:56:37 something you can say
02:56:39 do you have a note from your parents
02:56:41 saying I can't bully you
02:56:43 saying I shouldn't
02:56:45 respect you
02:56:47 it's never an excuse
02:56:49 for transphobia ever
02:56:51 okay
