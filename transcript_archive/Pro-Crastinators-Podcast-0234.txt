00:00:00 Hello. Okay, the show's starting. Yeah, okay. I didn't say the show's gonna start. The show's
00:00:08 starting. This is the beginning of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. We got me. Ben Saint. We got Gibbontake.
00:00:16 Hey. We got Tom Oliver. You all know. Back in the saddle. Okay, our guest this week. I'm stoked
00:00:28 to have her on. Mallory Malapert. Is that your real name? Is that your Twitter name?
00:00:33 No, that's just a Twitter name. Malapert is, my name is, my last name is Udicious. No one knows
00:00:40 how to. Udicious? Mallory Udicious. Malapert is just a Twitter name. Malapert means someone who's
00:00:46 saucy that likes to talk shit to, you know, people that are, you know, above them.
00:00:51 Yeah. News, news to me. Okay. Okay, so I will, I will try and introduce you. And if I, you disagree
00:00:59 with anything, you can, you can correct me. You might know her as the, the artist on Twitter who
00:01:06 made two, two particular pieces that were, that were controversially received by the broader
00:01:14 community. The first one was the new guy comic, right? Show that on, Eleazar, put it on screen,
00:01:21 show the new guy comic on screen, pause the video, read it, and think about it and consider,
00:01:25 consider, form your own opinion. Second one was, I don't know what to call it, the shoplifting one?
00:01:32 Well, you know, I should probably say like, you know, I do a webcomic called sweet beans.
00:01:37 People call me sweet beans. That's not my, but I call myself. I was calling you sweet beans until
00:01:43 like a week ago. Yeah. That's just the name of the webcomic. Okay. Now, now we've, we've cleared
00:01:51 that up. Right. Right. So the comic, your, your comic in general is called sweet beans, but that was,
00:01:55 was that like an episode of sweet beans? Would you call it? Yeah, you know, I don't know. It's
00:02:00 like sweet beans. We'll first off, you know, like I, yeah, I'm sorry, you might have to edit out
00:02:07 all my mumbling, but you know, it's just like a webcomic about like these, you know, characters
00:02:13 and, you know, they, they have feelings and I don't know. It's just like, yeah, I don't, I always
00:02:18 wanted to make a comic about characters and they bump up against each other and I wanted to develop
00:02:23 these characters. You know, I grew up watching the Simpsons and stuff like that. And, you know,
00:02:29 before sweet beans, I was doing like, you know, comics are, you know, like, the transphobia is
00:02:34 bad, you know, like that I started like in 2000. And I know, hey, you know, and like, hey, whoa,
00:02:42 self deprecating kind of stuff. And, you know, and, you know, I gotta just got sick of that. And,
00:02:47 you know, I just always wanted to make a comic with, you know, just a bunch of fun characters
00:02:53 with different personalities than, you know, struggling within securities and,
00:02:59 you know, just silly jokes and, and depressing stuff, you know, just like whatever comes to
00:03:04 my mind, you know, and have these characters. How long? I was going to ask how long sweet beans
00:03:12 has been going for? I started it like in 2019, like at the beginning. So it's not very old,
00:03:21 actually. You know, I feel like it's still new. I'm still figuring out all the characters. And
00:03:26 that like this past week, like one of the new comics was about characters, like I have that
00:03:31 have only been in the background so far, you know, so I feel like it's still new. I'm still
00:03:36 like figuring it all out. The one about the one about the two are like all hugging and stuff.
00:03:42 And the other two are like, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, like the Oh, thank you. Yeah. I literally
00:03:52 gave it a like on Twitter. That was how strongly I felt about it. Yeah. Okay. Anything else? Anything
00:04:04 else I forgot to mention? I mean, I was curious if we're just going to continue the conversation.
00:04:10 I was curious, like the name sweet beans, because like multiple times in the comics that I've been
00:04:15 reading, the characters say sweet beans as a reaction to certain things. Is there like,
00:04:20 is there a connection to real life? Like, is that something you just say all the time and you
00:04:24 decided to integrate that into the comic? Or is this something kind of came naturally? Like,
00:04:29 was it like a did the name come first? And that's just something you say? It was just kind of like
00:04:33 a coincidence? Because I wasn't sure if that was like a through line, because your your comic has
00:04:37 multiple characters. There's there's not like a central protagonist. There's like a couple,
00:04:41 there's characters that reoccur. But it's not always the same like continuous story. There's
00:04:46 like a little, it seems like from what I was reading, it's like slices of different characters
00:04:50 lives. But like multiple characters say sweet beans. And I was wondering if that was
00:04:56 relevant more than just like a phrase. And I'm just kind of connecting dots that aren't actually
00:05:00 there or if there's any story behind. Yeah, sweet beans is it came from, you know, like back in the
00:05:07 day, I just, you know, I've worked at slew of retail jobs. And, you know, like this, I worked at
00:05:13 Starbucks. And it was just like this, this phrase that, you know, like, all the co workers came
00:05:19 up with, you know, like, because we had this customer that came in all the time. And he'd be
00:05:23 like, Hey, guys, cool beans. And I'm like, cool beans, this is the stupid stop saying cool beans.
00:05:28 And then, you know, and then we decided sweet beans sounded cooler. And so like, basically,
00:05:34 anytime anyone's instead of saying cool, or yes, or any, it's like, we replaced it all with sweet
00:05:39 beans, sweet beans. And it just stuck around. And like, so like, you know, I don't know, for like
00:05:44 15 years, I've been trying to get people to say sweet beans. And then like one day, you know,
00:05:49 one day, I'm like, Oh, maybe I could just call the my my comic sweet things. How you do it.
00:05:53 Comic that, you know, sneak it in. And, you know, because I feel like it has like kind of like a
00:05:58 peanuts vibe, you know, like, oh, peanuts, those are cute little peanuts in there. And it's like,
00:06:03 it says sweet sweet. I assumed, I assumed that it referred to like pause like toe beans.
00:06:11 You know, you know what I'm saying? Little cats have little beans on there on their little
00:06:17 That's what I thought it meant. I don't know. That's cute. I like that. That's that's yeah,
00:06:22 that's what it's from now. Okay. We've successfully rewritten history.
00:06:28 Awesome. So, so yeah, I became I became aware of you. It was I remember it like it was only
00:06:35 yesterday, even though it feels like a lifetime ago, it was at the beginning of this year.
00:06:40 There was a kerfuffle the kerfuffle about the new guy comic didn't didn't
00:06:46 It was I remember it wasn't it. Okay, I might be misremembering, but I'm pretty sure that like
00:06:51 Oni plays like retweeted it and said that like this is like the first meme of the new year
00:06:56 or something like that. Fuck that guy. Yeah, well, because if the shit started on January 1st,
00:07:01 I woke up to it. Yeah. And that's how I knew 2020 was going to be a bad year. It's like I'm like,
00:07:07 no shit. And like it has been, you know, awful for me ever since like besides like, aside from
00:07:14 like the pandemic stuff and everything else that is like anxiety, like on a personal level, like,
00:07:19 it has been shit. And but yeah, like it's it's that comic is so stupid. I like I drew it
00:07:30 like in a couple hours, I just like wanted to test out these brushes I had. And like my friends and
00:07:35 I were like, you know, we're kind of complaining about like, how like, you know, it's just so much
00:07:42 bad stuff is going on in the world that people don't have empathy for, right? You know, and like
00:07:48 everyone's like, you know, I just see on the internet, like all these people like pouring it out
00:07:51 like love for this like millionaire douchebag gamer guy, you know, it was because PewDiePie had
00:07:58 gotten robbed, right? That's that's what it was about. Yeah, in reference to like, yeah, I was never
00:08:03 a hundred percent sure. Okay, I thought so. Yeah. So, you know, and like, I was just like, oh, whatever,
00:08:09 you know, I'm just gonna like I drew, you know, I was in a good mood and I drew this like stupid
00:08:15 comic out, you know, and like, you know, and it's it's funny to like, you know, at the time I
00:08:21 belonged to this, like, you know, the, you know, chat group full of cartoonists and they're all like,
00:08:27 yeah, this is great. This is hilarious, you know, and, you know, and so like, you know, and same
00:08:32 thing with, you know, comic artists are well, you know, the same thing with the the the shoplifting
00:08:37 comic like got approval from like all of my friends, you know, this is great. Sure. You know,
00:08:42 and then like, you know, never trust your friends. Right. The public has a totally different
00:08:48 reaction. It's it's always like a blind side because you think like, you know, when you're
00:08:53 making something, you always kind of want to run a pie people just make sure like there's not like
00:08:56 spelling errors or it doesn't look like crap or whatever. And you get the okay from your friend
00:09:00 group and then you go out into the wider world and it's a totally different reaction like I tried.
00:09:04 I tried to avoid this. I did my best. I ab tested it and it didn't work. The the the meat. So,
00:09:11 so the meme was right this this the like oh first first meme of the new year whatever new decade
00:09:17 whatever was that like the the new guy, the guy who the guy who was like offended on behalf of
00:09:23 PewDiePie is the the night sky he's he's right basically was the joke and like people were like
00:09:30 people were like drawing like redoing it with like like, you know, making him look good and him
00:09:35 you know showing like oh what a sweet guy like oh he's so sweet he's so kind. I
00:09:39 and I was like puzzled because I saw all these redraws and like aren't about that guy before I
00:09:45 found what it was from and I was like who is this person like what is this even in reference to
00:09:50 and then I found it and I read it and I was like what is this about and I was like oh okay PewDiePie
00:09:54 got raw and I was like no no fuck it fuck PewDiePie who gives a shit if some gamer bro gets robbed
00:10:00 like why am I supposed to feel bad why should I feel bad for anything that happens to fucking a
00:10:06 multi-billionaire fucking Felix fucking like a you know douchebag idiot youtuber guy kind of
00:10:15 a little bit of a Nazi sometimes man like no thanks so I was like when when I had finally puzzled
00:10:23 out what was really going on with the whole like the whole meme or joke or or whatever I was like
00:10:30 indignant I was like no fuck this I hate this I hate that this has been the reaction to to
00:10:36 something that is so like yeah and I'm still and I'm still mad about it to this day when I think
00:10:41 about it um you know like honestly like the new guy thing it didn't bother me I I thought it was
00:10:47 funny like all the jokes that people were making some of them were funny yeah you know like you
00:10:52 know and you know and it's like so funny these days like everyone that has a hard time with me
00:10:58 like you know this is just like how it is on twitter it's like they want to they twist you
00:11:03 into this like thing that they want to see you as you know like you know and like it was just a
00:11:09 stupid comic that I didn't even care about I was just like you know I was just testing out brushes
00:11:14 I wasn't even thinking you know there's like this one asshole cartoonist I was like breaking down
00:11:18 how I like messed up the design because like you know this was a good guy you know and I was just
00:11:23 like oh I saw that yeah oh my god yeah I was I wasn't thinking any of that stuff out because I
00:11:30 literally like it was like you know and not like my sweet beans comics were like I give a shit about
00:11:36 it I it was literally like a doodle comic you know what I mean right yeah it's like that sort of
00:11:41 stuff pisses me off so much like the the the like nobody in their right mind would get so bent out
00:11:49 of shape out of like the design of this little slice of like like comedy comic webcomic that
00:11:55 they saw on the internet unless they had some other thing that they were trying to say although
00:12:01 there's some other problem that they had they had secretly that they didn't want to talk about they
00:12:05 said I'll just I'll talk about the art style instead and in order to bash from this person there's
00:12:11 all different ways people do this yeah you know it's it's such a huge problem on the end and like
00:12:17 it sucks how like everyone has just accepted it you know and like it's it's ridiculous and
00:12:24 these like social media platforms they just completely encourage all this behavior you
00:12:30 know it's like yeah I mean because I remember when I first read the comic my my initial reaction
00:12:36 like is like in the middle of the drama is like I can't understand where people are coming from I
00:12:39 guess I guess you'd like you know if you're if you're someone who's overly empathetic not even
00:12:43 overly but like you're an empathetic person you probably like you know anybody has something
00:12:46 bad for them you kind of feel bad for it sure like I could understand the perspective of the
00:12:51 comic too of just being like this guy has so much shit we don't need to like go to bat for him you
00:12:54 know and and when I when I saw the comic I was like okay and then I kind of like moved on and then
00:13:01 when like a week later people were still talking about it yeah why why is this such a big why why
00:13:08 is it such a big deal I wonder why I think it's just like it's because it's because Oni retweeted it
00:13:13 right because like you you get someone who has like a big profile to make a statement and then
00:13:18 their audience kind of piles on to it I you know what I I would like I would grant Oni that probably
00:13:25 I don't think he meant for it to happen either you think you know like because like it's so easy
00:13:30 for any of us to just make a comment yeah and just think nothing of it and then your audience takes
00:13:35 it and runs with it yeah you know yeah I mean I like Oni I think he's a funny guy but Twitter
00:13:40 makes you the worst version of yourself only Oni seems like kind of a douchebag honestly
00:13:45 that's my impression yeah like uh he like the week before he was messing with me he was messing
00:13:51 with this like other uh transgender cartoonist you know it's uh um it's it's a weird you know it's
00:14:00 like you know it's funny how people have a you know I feel like we're just like easy to pick on
00:14:08 you know what I mean yeah did so so so Oni was giving you shit before New Guy there's a there's
00:14:14 a history here then because I didn't know that oh well he wasn't giving me shit specifically
00:14:18 there was this other transgender um cartoonist I think what it is it's it's like it's um it's
00:14:26 the the boogeyman that is social justice and and everything that is you know under that umbrella
00:14:32 or perceived to be under that umbrella is all in in circles where people don't like
00:14:39 think of the nuance of these topics they just hit you know they watch a video about a person
00:14:44 dunking on a stupid comic or you know the the worst possible interpretation of of something
00:14:51 that's a little bit strange to them and then they just ascribe that thing to you know way too much
00:14:57 stuff so if anything is in any way social just to see or tumblery or trans or you know of that
00:15:06 nature they'll just think of it as a bad thing before even looking at it no absolutely and
00:15:11 then like these like they all think I'm like this like vokes gold you know like super tender queer
00:15:17 you know and that's like that's not not what I am at all you know like I'm very rough around the
00:15:22 edges I I'm trailer trash I you know like I you know like I try to be kind and respectful
00:15:30 to everyone you know and do this you know the nice social justice thing but like you know like
00:15:36 I mean like I yeah I'm definitely not like you know one of these people on Twitter that are like
00:15:42 you know constantly like screaming about you know that you're not you know you're not a school
00:15:48 yeah you're not a cop you know I I'm I'm you know I'm you know I'm something of an SJW
00:15:56 cut myself but also but also I also am not a cop that's the line with like when you're when you're
00:16:03 telling people when you're telling people what they should and shouldn't be doing that's that's
00:16:06 cop behavior and I don't think that's the line that's usually the stuff that people like the like
00:16:12 anti anti SJW youtubers bash on on the people who are saying this is you know like policing
00:16:19 language and and things like oh my free speech is being violated and then they just take that
00:16:24 animosity and they just put it on everything that even slightly resembles you know social
00:16:30 justice in any way or or even things that aren't related but they just think of it like that because
00:16:35 like I saw a lot of the new guy stuff you know you see comments underneath these things about like
00:16:44 you know this is what's wrong with America these this generation is fucked up and you know what
00:16:49 they're talking about and it's like yeah nothing to do with any of that it's it's the intellectual
00:16:55 shorthand of taking what you like the smallest possible context of somebody and applying all
00:17:01 the baggage of what you perceive their positions to be you know it's a you're literally straw
00:17:07 manning people you know they look at like that comic and they're like you must be this type of person
00:17:12 and so all the faults of that collective is ascribed to you personally and you're held to account
00:17:18 for it all which is ridiculous no I think I think you fucked up and I think you brought it all on
00:17:23 yourself because you gave yourself a little angry eyebrows and it made you unsympathetic and that's
00:17:28 why that's right that's right new guy was a round soft character that made him seem empathetic
00:17:36 and and the pointy glasses too many points the points implied negative connotations
00:17:42 he looked like heavy weapons guy from TF2 my favorite video game
00:17:48 you know it's it's it's funny so like a year and a half before so maybe two years I got
00:17:53 quote canceled again you know the the you know or base this is like the first time like yeah I got you
00:17:59 know uh fucked up you know I saw like people arguing on Twitter about like uh you know what
00:18:06 labels that LGBT people can and can't use and I just like came out like dude shut the fuck up who
00:18:12 cares what other you know yeah and then like people twisted that into like oh uh you know
00:18:19 you hate lesbians and bisexuals and I'm like oh my god you know but but the thing is it's like
00:18:26 these they ran with it you know like the the uh you know SGW or whatever you know you know
00:18:33 section of Twitter you know like the you know they ran with it and like you know there's like
00:18:38 people to this day I get like messages from that like oh you know you hate lesbians and I'm like oh
00:18:43 my gosh I've been married to lesbian for 10 fucking years what the fuck are you talking about it's
00:18:50 really it's really easy I don't know it's really easy to find something to like I don't know pretend
00:18:56 you have a problem with someone about if you uh if you I don't know if you if you've got some if
00:19:03 you I mean why would they do it in the first place I don't know the whole you know the whole like
00:19:07 I mean the whole micro label like um or whatever discussion is very fraught emotionally uh it's
00:19:15 it's it's it's people get people get really uh yeah hung up about it this is the thing that's the
00:19:21 problem right now I feel like it's like people are getting so passionate and like passionately
00:19:27 angry about these issues that deserve tons of nuance you know like you know it's a shoplifting
00:19:33 comic for instance you know it's like like there's obviously different sides to this
00:19:39 you know and uh you know and it's like why not like we can't why can't we have a discussion you know
00:19:45 it's it you know it's like this weird black and white thinking that uh that happens I don't know
00:19:51 if it's social media I don't know if it's just like human nature or what there's a lot to dissect
00:19:57 about the about the response to the shoplifting comic which I didn't mention but that was the
00:20:02 second like big time that I saw your stuff getting circulated around and was like oh it's
00:20:07 is that same is that same person oh what's going on now that's and again I saw I saw the reactions
00:20:13 to it and I saw edits of it and I had to like sort of work backwards and like what is this
00:20:18 referring to where did this come from and then again I found it and I was like no fuck that
00:20:22 fuck these people fuck uh a stealing is good actually but that's not even what I know that's
00:20:30 no I know that's not necessarily what you're saying in the comic it's just what I personally
00:20:33 think is that stealing is good that's that's all that's me though my views do not reflect those of
00:20:38 anyone else I associate with I'm gonna steal your computer next time oh why don't I doesn't
00:20:43 Bernie distribute all 90% of his taxes or whatever yeah okay sorry anyway what were you talking about
00:20:51 oh I guess uh never onto the shoplifting comic right that uh yeah so like
00:20:58 you know like I was I just wanted to like you know this is like something that I did in my youth
00:21:04 a lot right I shoplifted for you know because I grew up in poverty like I said I was trailer trash
00:21:10 you know like I just like for me and my friends like shoplifting snickers bars and stuff was
00:21:18 just normal you know because we didn't have money at all you know and like it you know and we lived
00:21:24 in trash and so uh you know and and this is another of my friends were like yeah this comic is great
00:21:31 you know I just it was to show this character you know I just like wanted to show this character
00:21:37 like doing this thing and then like later on in the series like slowly show like who this person is
00:21:43 you know and this is like just part of who this character is the comic presents the action like
00:21:49 pretty neutrally it doesn't even really comment or like it's just the thing that she does it yeah
00:21:56 like that's the thing they wanted to turn it into this discourse you know when like the actual text
00:22:02 of the comic was like you know and I could I guess I could you know like it's like I said I'm
00:22:07 I'm not like a professional like you know like like I didn't get to go to school or anything you
00:22:12 know this is just something I love doing you know like you know I didn't go to school to learn how
00:22:16 to like what how I should develop characters and story arts and stuff like that I'm just trying
00:22:21 to have fun and do my thing sure it's it's it's really strange because like that was one of the
00:22:26 things I was wondering when I read that shoplifting comic because I read it and it didn't come off
00:22:31 as that like much of an issue to me again it was one of the things that kind of shrug my shoulders
00:22:36 I'm like why are people getting so bent out of shape because like I guess the the question
00:22:41 that I was wondering and since reading more of your stuff it's been answered was like is this
00:22:45 like an autobiocomic trying to be prescriptive or is this just a character living their life
00:22:49 and doing things because if it's if it's the latter like there's no problem clearly it's not
00:22:55 it's not the latter like the comic makes no commentary about like yes you viewer should
00:23:02 go and steal I me I've been saying I'm saying that but the comic isn't
00:23:07 uh and and even even if the comic was saying that like who cares like you you can choose to
00:23:13 be like I don't agree with this and just sure move on even even if you thought even if you thought
00:23:18 that's what it was about for whatever reason it's just so strange how people like get so preachy
00:23:26 it's so preachy I guess it's all I don't even think it is I don't think it's cloud chasing like
00:23:32 like dog I don't know see responses to it like on twitter it's like it's like you know
00:23:39 posts or twitter accounts with like five followers are there just be okay I want to I want to unpack

00:24:10 so fucking hungry to act like a fucking cop on the internet it's because it's because they're so
00:24:15 fucking scared of of the video games being taken away by the scary women yeah I agree like and we'll
00:24:24 wait a second this is the part where I disagree right because like you know the chuds the right
00:24:28 wingers yeah you know like they're gonna do that thing you know that's a she violated the non-aggression
00:24:33 principle ah my my uh the no no no and and cap joke whatever I think I go on sorry you know
00:24:42 like you know no it is completely fine you know um like the you know the part that hurt me right
00:24:49 was like literally my own community right okay it's like group of lgbt cartoonists and allies
00:24:56 right yeah like a couple really popular respected folks in the community were like this is irresponsible
00:25:04 you know blah blah blah and that's that's that's when fucking shit hit the fan for me that sucks
00:25:11 so bad I don't care I don't care about right when you're you know like they could hate me all they
00:25:16 want like the whatever the chuckles never gonna please them laughs yeah you know I don't I really
00:25:22 don't care you know what like broke my heart was like how like it caught fire within my own community
00:25:29 and like basically I got canceled you know canceled uh that thing that doesn't exist you know um in uh
00:25:37 like you know and like you know all of a sudden all these people who I thought were like honestly
00:25:43 like friends who I talked to on the regular or at least acquaintances and well-wishers
00:25:48 are all of a sudden talking crap about me like you know just like unfollowing me blocking me
00:25:54 soft blocking me you know and uh you know like almost no like almost no one came out to defend me
00:26:00 it was so heartbreaking was it you know was it because there were I had a different yeah I
00:26:07 I was just gonna say I I only saw the chud stuff I didn't really see much of of of like I don't know
00:26:15 uh be heading like like like from it within like why like I don't understand because like
00:26:22 because now there's like oh I don't know like people are people are mad about this and I like
00:26:28 they just want to be like oh no no I don't endorse this no no no don't be mad at me too right that's
00:26:34 part of it too you know um I think uh you know uh there's like a lot of you know the stuff is
00:26:42 complicated I guess you know because there's like so many you know people doing different things you
00:26:47 know but I think you know basically uh a couple cool respected people in my community were like
00:26:53 fuck Mallory and like tons of people just like follow it along you know do you want to name do
00:26:59 you want to name names I am definitely not going to name names I'm not gonna bring myself down to
00:27:04 their level you know like you know I'm I'm just sort of curious like why would that even happen
00:27:13 like what what is so offensive to well I well okay so I've been trying to process this for months
00:27:21 you know because like I said like like you know I don't know if any of you have ever been part of
00:27:27 community and then getting exiled from it and then having like you know like people who I like
00:27:32 talk to on the radio just Tom was uh Tom here was uh lambasted by the Brony community once upon a
00:27:39 time that's true yeah quite a quite a few guys Brony's huh I when I was we were talking on Twitter I
00:27:46 told Mallory a little bit about our Brony history and uh you know I wouldn't say I wouldn't say we
00:27:54 were ever like ostracized though we pretty much left of our own accord except maybe Tom I mean on
00:28:00 that level the the the Brony stuff was mostly just shitty commenters who were mad that the baby
00:28:06 wasn't getting their bottle anymore and we weren't going to talk about pony videos uh pony episodes
00:28:11 anymore they were just like yeah you know I want you to do that forever I don't think any like friends
00:28:16 that we had made yeah I mean the thing that happened to me was I was just getting a lot of
00:28:21 shit from people for not being uh positive enough I was just like my whole my I was being paid
00:28:28 the pony show and that's evil that's something that discord would do I was is criticize the
00:28:33 ponies I was being paid $1,500 a month on patreon to talk about this show and so I talked about
00:28:38 this show and they were like you're not sucking it's dick enough and I was like all right well then
00:28:43 maybe I'm just shouldn't be doing this anymore and you guys are kind of dumb and then I lost
00:28:47 90 percent of my income in like one week yeah at the height dude 1500 a month completely insane
00:28:56 I'm drinking I'm drinking a I'm drinking a those are the good days so I mean like that's like
00:29:02 that is like the constant you know people like losing their income because like you know like
00:29:06 you have like a opinion about a cartoon show Jesus Christ yeah you know like it's it's it's
00:29:12 it's ridiculous you know well I'll defend the bronies I'll defend the bronies on that one I mean
00:29:17 they signed up to hear you gush about their favorite show to hear you you spread love and
00:29:22 positivity you know much much in the way that pinky pie would uh and then and then you didn't
00:29:27 deliver on your implied promise and so you you failed them I would say yeah I mean that's fair
00:29:34 but I mean like I mean I don't know it's like you like the pony show like why not like
00:29:40 take in other points of view that like might be critical like I it's it's it's ridiculous that's
00:29:46 you know like I I I love it when people tear apart the stuff I love it's funny like but
00:29:53 uh it's it's funny to think it's a funny question uh it's you know the the brony uh the brony
00:30:00 criticism the brony analysis youtube scene had a very particular uh culture surrounding it
00:30:07 and uh you know they were really in the market for a particular particular kind of analysis
00:30:12 I think I think the way I had always interpreted it uh just from the very beginning is that I
00:30:17 think so many people were into like the stuff that we were doing talking about the show in a
00:30:22 positive way is because they were looking for affirmations a bunch of dudes who felt who felt
00:30:27 like oh god I like this girly thing this feels so weird and then here's these people saying
00:30:32 that it actually has like legit merit so now I feel justified in my deviance and then anytime
00:30:38 you you said something that wasn't super positive it put their own identity the more the more
00:30:43 question the more people there were and like the more of like a professional veneer that they
00:30:48 could give themselves like say echoing the same like the show is good the show is a masterpiece
00:30:53 the show is important the show is valuable you know it's like it's like yeah reinforcing this
00:30:57 this uh yeah the whole the whole thing which people were really invested in uh you know
00:31:03 so yeah people were tying their identity to consumer products and felt insecure about
00:31:09 themselves and uh curious like consumer product isn't perfect yeah yeah it's kind of weird
00:31:21 it's kind of weird I don't think does perfect even exist um if you ask brownies it's my little
00:31:27 pony oh I wanted to make a joke I want to be like ha ha you've never seen uh have you I don't
00:31:33 have you seen the sonic the hedgehog 2006 oh that was a good joke thank you thank you very
00:31:45 okay I'm sorry um uh but yeah you know so yeah you're we're talking about like basically you
00:31:53 still like you know and like I'm not joking like this this shit affected personal relationships
00:31:59 you know like you know and like by the way folks out there listening don't try to be friends with
00:32:04 people who care way too much about their like social media like persona or like you know reputation
00:32:11 or whatever because they'll just like act like you don't exist anymore you know because like you
00:32:17 know oh no I you know because like associating with this person is iffy now so like like you know
00:32:23 I mean imagine like I don't know nobody nobody got mad nobody gets mad when like uh
00:32:30 ah god I don't know I'm trying to think of like another like comic or something that includes
00:32:36 I don't know a bit of mischief this is just some mischief that a character does and that's
00:32:43 I don't yeah and it's like imagine imagine being like this is irresponsible it's irresponsible to
00:32:48 depict mischief in Paris an upcoming comic is going to have a lot of mischief in it actually like
00:32:58 more more stealing destruction of property round three let's do it based did you see there was a
00:33:05 headline a couple months ago that like some people were had like done a little done some like they'd
00:33:11 like messed up a building or something and they were going to be like they there was a possibility
00:33:16 of them being sentenced to life in prison for mischief yeah it's yeah yeah it was because
00:33:22 this fucking like company that owned the building was like wanted to like make an example of them
00:33:26 or something uh I mean I I hope that it didn't god occur uh but that was property owners am I
00:33:33 property owners can't live with them gotta kill them uh okay uh yes you know but um but yeah you
00:33:42 know like it's like with this whole situation I feel like it's so easy to dunk on the right wingers
00:33:47 the chuds you know it's like sure you you know and that's like I'm just so sick of it you know it's
00:33:53 like you know you turn on the youtube and it's like another video of like some leftist like oh wow
00:33:57 you debunked Jordan Pearson again no shits wow you know like you know it's like it's not 2013
00:34:04 anymore man like things are different now I feel like you know like the left and progress it we need
00:34:11 to look at ourselves and see like our failings and try to do better in the future and like part of
00:34:18 the thing that we're doing is tearing each other apart over the smallest fucking little things I
00:34:24 the the left has a problem with like an endless purity test you know yeah you know there's these
00:34:30 people and they roam twitter and other social media and they're like you know like another
00:34:36 thing that happens to me the thing that happened to me last week right you know like uh someone
00:34:40 trotted out a comic that I did seven years ago to like I was just about to bring that up
00:34:47 so basically okay so it's been six months since the shoplifting comic right and I'm like I have no
00:34:52 regrets about making that comic you know I'm proud of myself you know like Cart making comics is
00:34:58 this thing I always wanted to do and I'm growing and I'm getting better and I'm starting to get good
00:35:03 at it you know and I'm proud of myself and like you know um and you know I'm not gonna be you know
00:35:10 I'm not just gonna carve away and like apologize and do that like fake apology thing that everyone
00:35:16 does you know when like the you know when I'm glad if I if I saw you apologize for it I'd be like
00:35:21 that sucks well yeah it's nothing to apologize for yeah well it's like the thing you know well
00:35:29 it's not apologizing you know it's just like I think to like when I was a kid you know like
00:35:34 you know like my my dad had a bad drug problem my parents are screaming at each other you know
00:35:40 we had no money we were barely making it by you know like I was always out of the you know I had to
00:35:46 get out of the house I was raised by wolves you know and like I was a feral kid and like you know
00:35:52 I'm not going to apologize for you know like in just you know because my audience is like you know
00:35:57 the age is like 15 to 45 is like you know and I just imagined some 15 year old kid that was in
00:36:04 a similar situation to me you know like you know it's like hey it's okay you know like
00:36:11 like you're not a bad person for stealing a Snickers bar or some you know uh some markers
00:36:18 you know and that's like another thing that got me um you know it's like well you know oh you have to
00:36:23 you should only steal things that you need to you know and it's like don't 15 year old poor
00:36:30 kids need you know uh art supplies too you know it's like you know and it just brings out how
00:36:37 much people in like these the so-called leftists or whatever progressives they you know they don't
00:36:43 like it and that's what I was going to get like these uh get to is that like the folks that gave me
00:36:48 a hard time you know it was mostly people from like these uh the queer animation folks right
00:36:55 and all of these people you know they grew up middle-class you know like LGBTQ folks in the
00:37:03 animation industry you know okay and like and and and like a lot of them you know they grew up middle
00:37:09 class upper class they got to go to college you know they you know they're not they've never really
00:37:15 struggled the way that you know I just I just couldn't I just couldn't get into Aladdin because
00:37:22 you know he steals that bread at the beginning and like he doesn't even eat it he gives it he
00:37:27 doesn't even need like it was terrible like like that that fucking that fucking merchant you know
00:37:32 that merchant's probably gonna like go out of business and die uh because of that bread you
00:37:37 know he really should have got his hand chopped off uh I mean he like the guard said like he knows
00:37:43 the penalty for stealing so he should have just accepted it in my humble opinion and that's the
00:37:49 thing too they they twisted it into this like you know I'm anti-worker now you know and it's all
00:37:54 like have you ever you know and it's like funny because like as when I was younger I helped organize
00:37:59 a labor union you know and it's like I you know I'm pretty based actually yeah I I'm carcaring I
00:38:05 ww member you know it's like don't tell me I fucking hate workers you fucking rich piece of
00:38:11 shit yeah damn yeah fuck that fuck yeah I'm so mad the the the you know this is the thing instead
00:38:22 like like you know like and like I said people who I thought were friends this stuff has cut me up at
00:38:28 night you know uh like the mental toll that it's it's taken on me I've lost sleep you know like
00:38:36 you know like some of my closest friends just gone
00:38:40 just because and it's and it's it's because they just didn't want to be associated with like
00:38:45 well you know that's a thing you know like what I don't want to like this I don't want to assign
00:38:50 too much now this to it you know what I mean but like it's it's just like you know like that's seen
00:38:55 in like the sci-fi or horror movie right where like the dystopian thing is happening and like
00:39:00 the person's getting shunned or like taken away and everyone just puts their head down and lets
00:39:05 it happen even though they all know what's wrong you know it's it's it's you know like
00:39:12 you know and you know because like people you know like they're trying to make money too and
00:39:19 they're trying to like you know do their thing you know and oh yeah you know what I mean like so
00:39:24 like even even if they don't think it's fair like I guess they think I think it's like they think
00:39:29 if they defended it they would like be perceived as like they would think it would look bad too
00:39:36 I understand yeah like oh you're now you're supporting this irresponsible mischief you
00:39:42 troublemaker you you you rascal they would say to this hypothetical person
00:39:49 I I get it I guess uh hmm yeah you know it like but you know like it burned you know it
00:39:57 chewed me up on inside and the insides and like I even like at one point like you know during one
00:40:01 of my lowest points you know like a couple of the people you know in the community who like I feel
00:40:06 like did me dirty like I sent some messages to you know and I was like hey what are you treating me
00:40:11 unfairly what happened to me was nuts you know like you know and you know they like just came back
00:40:17 and you're manipulative you're trying to make me feel bad right now and I'm like well you should
00:40:21 feel bad like that shit sucks you know like you know like yeah Jesus Jesus Christ not likes the
00:40:28 comic the and then just like shut there's so much stuff I don't like and I just shut up about it
00:40:34 you know you don't have to say you know you don't have to like you know try to ruin a person
00:40:40 shit you know well uh yeah you know but and and that's and that's the thing you know it's like
00:40:49 we can't have we can't have this conversation at all on the lefty it's like you know because like
00:40:53 you know ass like right wing assholes like are constantly complaining about like cancel culture
00:41:00 right it's like you know it's like these rich you know fucking comedians and stuff they're like oh no
00:41:06 people are being mean to me on the internet and so like and now like you know ours you know the
00:41:10 leftist response is like well that doesn't exist canceling doesn't exist you know okay yeah you
00:41:16 know and it's yeah and like I feel like that's like kind of um the thing that like we need to
00:41:24 start doing you know it's like some of the things that right wingers complain about there's like
00:41:28 nuggets of validity too that we should sure like honestly answer to you know like you know like uh
00:41:36 the virtue of signaling thing you know it's like how like companies you know like like uh
00:41:42 you know companies try to sell stuff to like lgbt people you know by putting a rainbow on it but
00:41:47 they don't give a fuck about us you know like oh yeah i've always hated that the whole you know
00:41:51 look disney and like capitalizing on of people's um acceptance of of these sorts of things they
00:42:00 don't actually care as soon as it stops being profitable they'll stop making it what did right
00:42:04 letter media call it passive progressive which i thought was a good coin of phrase for it you
00:42:09 know it's such a i don't know i don't know if it comes from like genuine ignorance or if it's
00:42:14 like a deliberate bad faith when people say like oh the the left is hypocritical because like
00:42:20 companies sell i don't know people like conflate it like they think that that's what the the left
00:42:26 is like that's what progressivism is is like oh it's just companies selling stuff with rainbows
00:42:30 on them oh it's just hypocritical and like no they're doing that in spite of what's good
00:42:36 you know yeah you know i'm capitalizing on on on on idea that's not that's not the
00:42:42 that's not the thing in itself yeah really you know when we get like overly happy about like
00:42:48 this like corporate intellectual property is like slightly more oh yeah they put the
00:42:53 you know they put the lesbian cop in that in that one in that elf movie or whatever
00:42:58 but even like the stuff that we consume you know like that like a lot of us like you know like
00:43:02 everyone loves shira right you know and everyone's like you know but like
00:43:07 you know like i it's it's uh sorry you know um but then like you know but the people who make
00:43:17 these things they're like they're they're rich and they're like yeah at the end of the day it's all
00:43:23 owned yeah it's it's you know they're making money off of you you know and like and i think
00:43:29 representation is good i want more representation in the media but like it's this like kind of
00:43:36 let's examine maybe you know like maybe just not blindly celebrate stuff and like you know
00:43:42 like hey are you just trying to like get money out of us get brownie points you know because like
00:43:48 there's a lot of you know cynical shit going on and uh it's it's it's uh it's sad i don't like it
00:43:56 representation only only happens in the framework of like when it's when it's uh you
00:44:01 know when it's gonna make money yeah that's what that's what you know people that are so concerned
00:44:08 about like uh you know uh uh i don't know white erasure or something or whatever i don't know they're
00:44:16 like uh they're like they think that like an agenda is being forced here that like oh this is
00:44:22 this is a conspiracy the illuminati or something is like oh they're all putting oh they're all putting
00:44:27 colored people in my in my media and for for various uh i won't speculate on what they think
00:44:33 the goal is there but uh you know it's like it's not true it's never it's never true it literally
00:44:39 is only done to to sell shit yeah it's it's the demographics changed and now they can make money
00:44:46 off of it and and then they know too that like oh we get this like you know like oh we have a
00:44:53 lesbian making this tv show now and so that we'll get you know and that you know it's it's also
00:44:59 girl boss it's fucking bullshit man and don't get me wrong i love that you know lesbians
00:45:04 should make all the tv shows you know what i mean like agreed that's great yeah it's it's like it's
00:45:10 it's a fanciful notion that it could all happen naturally but we know it doesn't and it's annoying
00:45:15 yeah it's capitalism man like that's you know it makes you question everything you know because
00:45:23 when when the motive can be so poisoned you can't really trust anybody at their word that they're
00:45:28 doing this for a legitimately positive reason there's always a financial motivation and it's like
00:45:33 well then what was the point you know and like i'm that's i'm being a little cynical about it too
00:45:39 you know and like that's why i keep stressing i like shira i like all of this stuff too you know
00:45:45 but like i don't know i think it's something about the internet just like creates this like
00:45:49 black and white thinking you're either on this side or that side you know like these like uh you
00:45:55 know there's like these fractions on the left it's split up you know there's like these people who
00:46:01 just like you know they're like fuck identity politics 100 percent and you know and like you
00:46:06 know and then these other you know on the other end that's you know like people getting mad at
00:46:11 like you know my comic for you know supposedly hitting trans men when a trans man actually helped
00:46:16 me write that comic you know and it's you know um yeah i just uh i wish there was more nuance and
00:46:26 people yeah i think but you know most entirely the problem is the platforms that we use to
00:46:32 communicate such as twitter it's mostly twitter i feel like youtube is also a bit bad because
00:46:38 you know comment sections on youtube videos are terrible and nobody ever likes reading them
00:46:43 and video responses are usually lengthy and hard to to watch all of and twitter is like
00:46:49 the opposite problem there's so much like small bite size takes you can't have a big discussion
00:46:57 in a twitter thread without it being very difficult to read it's like yeah it goes wherever
00:47:03 yeah and you know i think it's in a in a forum like discord it's a little better because two
00:47:11 people can have like a lengthy one-on-one and get to the bottom of the disagreement i've seen it happen
00:47:17 i've had a few disagreements and arguments in discord and they've been a lot more fruitful than
00:47:21 ones ever had on twitter another good thing about discord is that it's not as public you know when
00:47:27 you're having an argument on twitter there's a pressure that like you're in public and you need
00:47:31 to fucking slam dunk this thing because everyone's watching when you're in discord you have like the
00:47:35 freedom to make mistakes you know because if you're talking one on one with somebody it's just you
00:47:40 and that other person and if you say something that's wrong no one's going to be there to fucking try
00:47:44 and dunk on you or like analyze your conversation it's just the two of you and that's how conversation
00:47:49 generally has worked for like all of human history and it's only now with social media that we have
00:47:54 you have 250 characters to take down this other person because everyone's watching you.
00:47:58 Arguing on twitter, arguing on twitter really is a farce it really is just uh you know something
00:48:04 you do for the sake of anyone who's watching yeah it's true it's that's all it is and it's because
00:48:09 like you can never you never you never don't feel that like oh this is public like everyone like you
00:48:15 know anyone can see this right it changes everything so i i never think about that stuff you know i
00:48:21 can't help but to be really genuine and like messy well i mean come on you know like i think
00:48:27 maybe it wasn't you that was saying oh i like how messy you are you know and uh maybe uh yeah then
00:48:34 maybe it was someone i don't know someone recently said oh i love like how you know messy you are
00:48:40 you know like i don't like your art or like in your your house no like yeah messy like as in you
00:48:45 know like i'm raw and genuine you know that's so maybe that was not you know i don't think that was
00:48:51 me but but you know what i was trying to get at is that you know you know everyone's so worried
00:48:59 but i i don't know i think it'd be nice if people would just like just you know would be able to
00:49:05 loosen up a little bit and you know and then give space to others to process feeling lost or like
00:49:12 you know it's it's just moved so fast you know it's like you're either right or wrong you know
00:49:16 and good or bad you know and it's it's it's it's garbage it's it's it's not working it's obviously
00:49:24 not working you know there's like nazis on the street now fucking killing people you know i mean
00:49:29 it's because it's like social media is all about it's like the business of attention arbitrage
00:49:35 everybody who's on there who wants to like make something of themselves you have to gain attention
00:49:40 i know it's a nice word right it feels it feels good to say yeah nice um and so like the the things
00:49:46 that sell are the extremes and so it pushes everybody more and more to the extreme because
00:49:52 that's what gets you more attention and then if you're trying to have any nuance you're shot down
00:49:56 as a centrist or just like you know milk toast or your your lack of like hard line stances on
00:50:02 something means you're empowering the other side because everyone else is ingrained in their own
00:50:06 opinions and it's like left no room for nuance and it's left no room for growth you know people
00:50:12 people have just used people have used like people have like uh i think the well is a little poisoned
00:50:19 on nuance because people have like i don't know people will sort of pretend to be trying to have
00:50:24 a nuance take when they're what they're really doing is trying to push an agenda but they're like
00:50:29 they pretend not to be doing that they pretend like oh but you know there's more there's there's
00:50:34 a lot of that is obvious though you know it's like because then you go and see how they're
00:50:38 following it's like Ben Shapiro and stuff you're like okay go go help you know what do you mean
00:50:43 yeah you know like i you know i think like you know when you know it's someone like in your own
00:50:49 community like like you know enter a conversation with them in good faith you know but that that
00:50:58 did not happen whatsoever you know like well i mean like don't get around there's been tons of people
00:51:04 who've been supportive and love me and i just am forever grateful to the folks who stuck around
00:51:10 in the face of you know like being judged you know by hanging out with a priah or whatever
00:51:18 you know but uh ah gosh i i'm sorry i lost my train of thought so that i got i got i was gonna
00:51:26 i was gonna say uh what's uh what's uh i don't know what's everyone up to how's everyone feeling
00:51:33 how's your week how's your week been are we all uh i i i can talk about nothing because i've been
00:51:41 doing nothing i've been playing war the warcraft a lot based and i've been i've been going through
00:51:47 a weird phase where i'm like i'm i'm gaming hardcore or casual or rather you know i'm
00:51:53 gaming hardcore on online on surf in the web um and i'm like usually i would feel terrible and want
00:52:02 to die because i'm supposed to be working i'm supposed to be a hardworking artist making comics
00:52:06 making things supposed to be working right now and uh and usually that would lead to by the way
00:52:13 yes that would that would usually lead to a depression spiral um but it hasn't i'm just
00:52:21 i'm just playing games and i'm really into it and uh that's my week hell yeah it's a it's a really
00:52:28 good happy story but there's not much to say i could talk about the world of warcraft lore but
00:52:35 i don't know if anyone else has played uh that that game i haven't played enough to understand it
00:52:41 unfortunately oh i know i just really like it board rules uh alliance rules i've been yeah oh hell
00:52:48 yeah um but i've been going through like old quests and being like you know things that i

00:53:24 starter uh uh rewards i did a kick starter last last year and then it took me all that time to
00:53:31 actually get the product ready to ship and now it's taken me like two months to actually get
00:53:36 around to shipping them and uh it should have been done it should be done by now but it's i have like
00:53:41 i have like seven more to do and i'm like uh because i because i have to make drawings in each of
00:53:46 them yeah those drawings you've been doing are looking really good uh you know i don't you know

00:54:57 i still haven't i'm still under the yoke i'm still under the yoke of of doing a delivery on all this
00:55:03 shit uh and it's kind of my fault i've just kind of been like dragging my ass about it again as i
00:55:09 always do that's i'm supposed to be working right now and uh and then when that's done i am about to
00:55:15 receive i am about to receive in the mail the final shipment of the rewards for the rfck kick
00:55:22 starter so then i will have to do it again and i've been thinking never like god it never ends

00:55:52 more about nuzlocke and i and i started huh that would be fine you should do it i i will i will do
00:55:59 it uh it's just um you know only one my other stuff is like only when i feel like i've satisfied
00:56:06 uh my other shit um i just want to i don't know uh it's just like dive into it i could i could even
00:56:11 see myself just like maybe streaming it just like every day just like wake up and just start streaming
00:56:15 pokemon just do it like every day for like you know a week or a month or however fucking long
00:56:20 it takes uh it would be something to just like lose myself in i don't know something to so i could
00:56:27 be like gib and i could just be hardcore gaming and not even feel bad about it um i would um i would
00:56:33 um oh fuck i was gonna say oh yeah i've been watching i've been watching this youtuber well
00:56:37 i guess he was a twitch streamer who has like recently gained a bit of a following on youtube as
00:56:42 well uh uh uh pokemon challenges who is the best the best nuzlocke or in the world is his uh claim
00:56:50 to fame uh and he does like he just he's on twitch and he just fucking he just nuzlocke's
00:56:55 like even nuzlocke's fan games he just does them over and over and over again uh he you know does
00:57:00 imposes all kinds of like extra extra uh challenges on himself when he does it
00:57:05 and i'm watching his shit and i'm just like yes um oh i love it it's so i don't know something
00:57:11 something about it is very uh it just just makes me want it makes me want it makes me want to do
00:57:16 another one but i can't do it but i can't do it because i'm too anxious about all the things that
00:57:22 i have not done other than yeah yeah the struggle yeah it's it's a it's a pretzel of like um the
00:57:31 anxiety the anxiousness of having all this hanging over your head is more of the obstacle that stops
00:57:39 you from doing it and you you've got to try and somehow untangle that in you know do things in
00:57:45 the right order and it's like i can't figure out how to do this in the right order in order to
00:57:49 untangle it and you just sit there for months right the analysis paralysis of like what do i do
00:57:57 makes you do nothing and then you just feel worse i've just been doing resin printing
00:58:01 i finally got my resin printer all set up and going i posted one on twitter uh that looks so good
00:58:07 it's like so much better than the old prints i was doing and i'm just like oh man like i would
00:58:12 actually be okay like selling this like the other ones like i was sending them to patrons
00:58:16 i have to send a bunch out actually today or tomorrow because it's sunday uh but these ones
00:58:21 like i would actually be able to sell they look professionally done and just like oh my god oh
00:58:25 this is the best thing in the world so i'm just gonna make it army folks try to uh have you tried
00:58:32 Adderall have i tried no oh god no not i've heard that of that being used to be productive i don't
00:58:41 know what it is so exactly i thought it was an alcohol for a while but it sounds like
00:58:48 because it starts with an a and i know of absence as a thing i thought maybe that will help i was
00:58:55 brief i was briefly on i was briefly on some i don't think it was Adderall i was briefly on
00:59:00 some like adhd medication when i was like in high school even though i don't think i have that uh
00:59:08 and it didn't go that well made me very irritable i and i punched a hole in the i kicked a hole in
00:59:12 the wall uh and then my dad was like i'm taking you off that stuff but i'm still gonna but i'm
00:59:18 gonna even though i i i ben's dad uh uh got ben prescribed this stuff because i thought he was uh
00:59:27 he was being a little bitch uh and then and then when ben freaked out and kicked a hole in the wall
00:59:35 i will take him off the stuff but also punish him for it by making him repair the hole i see no
00:59:40 contradiction in this i take no responsibility for anything uh thanks dad given you beast pills
00:59:51 so ben's got daddy issues huh uh uh that's a terrible thing to say about a person
00:59:59 i would never accuse my even my worst enemy i was just trying to be funny well well everyone
01:00:06 else laughed so nah bullseye bullseye you got it yeah yeah okay throwing him under the bus all right
01:00:13 all right moving on moving on uh you guys all okay got we gotta talk about it wait wait wait
01:00:21 we can't move on we have Mallory hasn't said if they're doing anything cool we we all just talked
01:00:25 oh now we just sat there and listened patiently are you making any new cool comics do anything
01:00:29 fucking sick oh i do have something coming up uh uh let's see so i i i have i have been pretty
01:00:39 quiet about this uh so far but uh there's gonna be a plushie of my character ivy available soon
01:00:47 so oh fuck where you get is he getting that made through like a site or something or you're doing
01:00:51 like by hand or how's how's how's that production begin uh yeah so yeah so this is the thing this uh
01:00:57 marketing dude from this toy company called make ship got ahold of me and was like hey we want to
01:01:04 make your character into a doll this is what we do and uh basically it works like Kickstarter
01:01:10 they like i guess they go out and find people who they think could uh sell enough of these i
01:01:15 need to sell 400 for it to work what and uh yeah i think i could do it i don't know maybe
01:01:22 we'll see now that's so cool that they came to you i tried to make um i tried to kick start a
01:01:26 plush of my character once it didn't work but i just went through Kickstarter i was i found this
01:01:33 this this what was it called uh i can't remember i got this thing and i was like
01:01:41 yeah and they do mass produce orders uh i'm so angry about it still
01:01:50 i i put my money down i was there you should you should um i think we maybe talked about this
01:01:58 before but when you do uh the uh you should make you should make it a stretch goal for uh the next
01:02:04 thing that you're going to bell jay book yeah yeah the bell jay book
01:02:10 because i think that's because i think yes yeah because i think the um the issue was like you
01:02:16 know it's kind of an expensive item uh you know kind of a high barrier to entry whereas i think
01:02:21 if the if the book was like you know maybe 20 bucks or something i think there would be a
01:02:25 lot of people who would go for that uh uh and uh you know i think more people would be interested
01:02:33 in making you know you know there's a there's a certain crowd you know people got a budget
01:02:36 for this kind of stuff uh yeah so i don't know piggyback it piggyback it off of another thing
01:02:43 perhaps uh i would like i would like a pump a pump plush uh be pretty pretty pretty epic
01:02:50 haha uh oh yeah oh yeah and you put the you put the you put my pins on it on it's on it or on
01:02:56 on shawl right or no on your brisker yeah my brisker plush that i they got from the same company
01:03:03 yes right it's it's cool anyway the ivy plush how's that how's that going uh i guess well right
01:03:09 now they're just designing it and then i have to approve it and then i guess the camp the pan can't
01:03:15 then the campaign is going to start in the next couple weeks oh shit soon that's so cool have you
01:03:20 seen yeah i hope it works have you seen i've never done do you know what it looks like no i've i've
01:03:24 just seen i've seen the designs for it well how would you feel if i stole one wouldn't that be
01:03:33 ironic hmm oh i know yes it's the that is that it's completely on the same level it's dealing
01:03:40 from a multimillion dollar corporation yeah yeah get owned okay well that's pretty uh yeah i'm pretty
01:03:48 excited about it um right now i have a comic promoting it on my patreon like once it gets closer
01:03:54 to the actual campaign i'll share on the other social medias um based based yeah i hope it works
01:04:02 out because i definitely couldn't handle another public humiliation at this point i think who among
01:04:09 us could uh do you have can you show us well they haven't designed it yet so you don't know
01:04:14 what it looks like yet right yeah but um i don't know if you go to my uh patreon there's a comic about
01:04:21 it uh uh you know there's a public for all god no no okay okay you gotta pay the dollar baby
01:04:29 shut down uh wait what's your what's your patreon uh is it plug sweet things patreon.com slash uh let's
01:04:37 see mpng is my png oh wow oh wow nice nice killing it you're killing it over here uh
01:04:55 see that's because i don't make promises i can't make you know basically my patreon deal is is like
01:05:00 you know people who sign up could see the comics before i put them on social media and that's it
01:05:06 you know and then that's the deal you know that yeah because uh because like i you know i got the
01:05:13 ad hd i got the depression uh you know sometimes i could go a little bit without doing anything and
01:05:20 i don't want to make promises i can't make or can't keep yeah i would be um yeah my my patreon
01:05:27 is also it's like tom does like rewards and stuff and i'm like that sounds hard it's yeah a lot of work
01:05:35 you know and like that's it you know with my comic i'm just like i make all these comics for me
01:05:40 i'm not like i don't think about audience and stuff like that which obviously keeps backfiring on me
01:05:46 you know um sure but i don't care because it's like you know it's like i'm just doing this for me
01:05:51 and i'm just very blessed and lucky that a lot of people enjoy it so you know it's like i pay my rent
01:05:58 doing you know uh anthropomorphic comics you know that's pretty cool that is the dream
01:06:06 have you read tales gets trolled uh no but i i know the drawings okay okay good it's a good
01:06:14 it's a good comic i reckon i recommend it highly um how does that stuff work with all the copyright
01:06:21 stuff you know i just you know like uh one of my favorite artists right now they they do all this
01:06:26 Burton Ernie uh fan art and they're doing a comic of Burton Ernie and they're gay together and stuff
01:06:32 like that like oh i've seen some of those that's really cute yeah isn't that great i love that
01:06:37 i think i think that's probably uh yeah i think if they're like making money through patreon i think
01:06:45 it would probably not be a problem i know that the the the mario that that like mario animator guy
01:06:52 got his patreon shut down by nintendo let's see mario bro depends on on who owns the coffee right
01:06:58 and whether they're willing to go out and you know hunt down people using the the likenesses of
01:07:04 characters just to put like a lot of the time you can just get away i love but mario no no no no
01:07:12 i love nintendo games like they're my favorite but god they're such fucking ass they are yeah yeah
01:07:19 yeah they're very litigious you know it's like they can they they can lose money every single year
01:07:26 for like 300 years and still like be a decent business like what are they doing with this
01:07:31 shit like why what is the point of it you know they're the i think they're the richest company in
01:07:36 japan as of like this year i believe so yeah the switches don't really well they're shareholders to
01:07:43 please some some people with i gotta wear suits are they need money i think and that's why
01:07:54 they say please more money and they nintendo says yes they get it yes so you know what no but but
01:08:01 what the i don't you know see this is the thing we're just like rich people in general i think
01:08:05 in companies and stuff it's they don't want more they specifically want other people to have less
01:08:11 you know like because they have enough all these rich people have enough nintendo has enough
01:08:16 they specifically want you know these people making their fun little games their their tribute games
01:08:24 and you know comics or whatever they want them to have less it's really disgusting i think i
01:08:31 think rich people treat money like normal people treat social media followers it's about it's
01:08:37 just about score it's about keeping score i need a higher score because once you have that much money
01:08:41 it's no longer a resource like your bases are covered you're never going to have to worry about
01:08:46 money and like spending it to acquire things to live so that point you're just keeping score who
01:08:51 could be the richest person i want to be i want to have the most subscribers i want to have the most
01:08:55 money and so it's it's about squeezing as much out of the people so you can be higher on that
01:09:01 like tier list of of rich people it's just like that's why jeff basos has a bajillion dollars
01:09:06 he's just like ego tripping hardcore do you know it's really funny about that too it's like just
01:09:12 like rich people like you know folks with like lots of followers say like want to pretend like that
01:09:17 isn't any kind of currency whatsoever you know like it doesn't exist like uh you know like people
01:09:24 like they like turn their nose up at the term of social capital when like you know the only reason
01:09:29 why my stuff gets seen is because i got 22 000 followers and like you know like a couple's even
01:09:35 more famous people follow me you know that's like it gives you legitimacy and then it just helps you
01:09:41 even further you know uh it's social capital is translated like directly into actual capital
01:09:48 all the time it's like how it works yeah but you know you'd like go into some of these like
01:09:54 progressive or leftist spaces and they'll crucify you for saying that you know is it like i mean do
01:10:00 people i don't know i i think it's if you've got if you've got clout if you've got the followers
01:10:08 it's probably pretty tempting or pretty uh you know to say like to want to pretend that like
01:10:14 that's not a thing if you've got it uh uh but like you know i mean who who among us you know
01:10:22 when you interact when you have like a twitter interaction with like someone with way more
01:10:26 followers than you or something and then suddenly like you're you're flooded with uh you know
01:10:32 with notifications like way more than usual you know like it's obvious it's obvious that
01:10:39 like a phenomenon is occurring here that you have we have we have we have butted up against a
01:10:46 a sort of a power differential here that is causing uh some effects you know it's very it's yeah
01:10:53 and do you know it's funny i think we just got to the crux of a lot of the issues that we've
01:10:58 been talking about today you know it's a bunch of weird power dynamics you know that happen
01:11:07 yeah oh yeah like like uh i don't want to like assume too much but like i i know people would
01:11:15 like just turn on each other when like uh you know their friend is like oh now they're famous now
01:11:22 they go to all this cloud well now i hate them and i want them to die and i want them i want to
01:11:26 cancel them to see how they like having nothing just like me people get really emotional about
01:11:32 things like that oh absolutely they do you know it's like i even even have friends right you know
01:11:39 like uh recently like i'm like hey you know i told one of my you know comic friends and like
01:11:43 i got this plushy thing going on and like the first thing they said was like well why didn't
01:11:47 they come to me for the plushy i'm like what the heck why can't you just be happy for me man
01:11:52 yeah it's i mean i understand the temptation to succumb to the sour grapes it's it's okay to have
01:12:00 sour grapes you just don't lead with it you you say you know sour grapes are a natural phenomenon
01:12:05 but you can't let that you acknowledge your sour grapes you can't lead the the charge with a sour
01:12:09 grape it's a bad look yeah it's not very nice acknowledge them and move past them
01:12:16 um no one likes talking about sour grapes or envy or jealousy it's like this such a taboo
01:12:22 subject that like everyone's like oh no i don't feel those feelings ever you know um and i feel
01:12:29 like uh especially on social media especially with like people who are trying to like do something
01:12:35 and have an audience you know i feel like that stuff is a lot more common than it's it's obvious
01:12:41 the numbers yeah everybody you obviously are there you want the numbers to be higher because
01:12:47 that like makes it more effective at whatever it is you do it yeah like who who does what people
01:12:53 are embarrassed to have emotions people are embarrassed to admit that they get angry at
01:12:57 things and it's it's not good they got it it's all part of humanity and living and being a person
01:13:05 if you if you hide behind like oh oh no no i'm i'm like like a robot that makes me cooler than
01:13:12 you actually it's just it's just lies be true be real it's it's weird you know and and that
01:13:21 that's why i don't trust anyone with like over 50 000 you know followers on twitter it's like
01:13:27 you know it's like wow you're you're pleasing that many people at once you know you're just
01:13:32 good at keeping the mask on right you know like giving everyone what they want yeah i mean as your
01:13:39 audience gets bigger it gets more difficult you know it's more difficult to kind of juggle all those
01:13:45 competing interests from people who follow you and like i on the one hand it's like we'll just be
01:13:50 yourself like resist that temptation but like when your livelihoods tied up in that it becomes a much
01:13:55 more complicated equation yeah it's true it's true you just gotta be i i i try to be very genuine
01:14:04 yeah that's a cool thing i mean as your as you when your audience is big enough when your when
01:14:08 your platform is big enough i assumed i assume there comes a point where it all just becomes
01:14:13 noise and you just like can't listen to any of it and you just kind of probably have to just
01:14:19 just zone it out and like not even worry about like what anyone's like saying uh because if you
01:14:24 list because there'd be so much i don't know imagine you have like a hundred thousand followers
01:14:28 and every time you tweet you get like hundreds of replies i mean you might you might read some
01:14:34 and get like a sort of like feeling about like the general kind of thing people are saying and
01:14:38 like what people think about what you're doing but uh you know you would sort of just that's all you
01:14:45 would could really get is like a feeling like there's too much yeah you you would need too much to
01:14:48 really need managers you would need like um people vetting like reading and being like hey have you
01:14:54 heard that people are saying this like because you personally couldn't keep track of everything you'd
01:14:58 need you would need other people to to sift through it if there was a reason to do so yeah and i think
01:15:06 that's really tough because like from a user perspective like like the reason like people
01:15:12 who aren't creators who don't have a huge audience like social media so much is because it gives you
01:15:18 a communication line to people you care about right like we all have people who are interested
01:15:22 in our work and they can talk to us on a level that normally you wouldn't have access to with like
01:15:27 a celebrity and like traditional uh media um yeah and so there's like that personal feeling
01:15:33 and then once you get big enough that feeling dissolves on your side because it's just there's
01:15:38 just so much you like literally just as a human being can't process all that information but all
01:15:44 those a hundred thousand people still feel like they have a connection with you and it's incredibly
01:15:49 difficult and then it gets back to the thing that you're saying earlier like you know as soon
01:15:53 as something gets popular people look will fuck that stuff exactly it comes cool to hate because
01:15:58 then like there are a bunch of people but hurt that you made it well you know and and that's
01:16:02 completely understandable too you know because like you know it's like i i love comics and
01:16:07 cartoons right and like every single day i just see such incredible work from people that have like
01:16:12 a thousand followers two thousand followers you know it's like what do i do that's so special
01:16:18 you know i got 22 000 people on twitter following me 20 000 people on facebook
01:16:23 you know like i i don't you know like i just feel like there's so many more
01:16:27 cartoonists that are doing you know better work i've seen i've seen really great art from people
01:16:33 with a lot less of a following than me and i'm like huh makes makes you think makes you think
01:16:40 that maybe the meritocracy is a lie it is a complete lie you know it's uh i'm just i'm just
01:16:47 i just can't shut up i'm an attention whore you know i'm just lonely and so i go to twitter because
01:16:52 i'm alone and it's this like false sense of community and i'm like and i just say my random
01:16:57 thoughts and people are like hey yeah that's right you know i hate to admit that i also do that
01:17:03 but it's it's so obvious that's what it's for it is i guess that is what it's for i mean
01:17:08 studies show that uh folks that uh feel more lonely are more likely to post more
01:17:14 on social media so like when you see you know one of your favorite you know someone posting
01:17:18 over and over again you know like yeah give them a comment or even rich i'll be like hey how you
01:17:22 doing today you know um i feel i feel called out i feel seen in a bad way any of folks that
01:17:34 listen to the the guy the musician jeff rosenstock i don't no i don't know anything
01:17:43 about uh he's like this uh you know kind of punky musician he uh he got to start doing like scott music
01:17:53 in the early 2000s and then um uh went solo but uh you know uh he's getting he actually oh he does
01:18:02 all the music for craig of the creek uh yeah yeah he's uh um if you like punky type of music i highly
01:18:11 suggest it um but like basically all of his watches cartoons i do watch cartoons i like them a lot
01:18:19 yeah curtains are fun i love all ages cartoons um but yeah like anyway one of the lyrics that stands
01:18:27 out to me is you know he says rushes to his phone because he doesn't want to feel alone you know um
01:18:33 you know that's like exactly what i do too you know it's like i'm sitting all alone and i'm like oh
01:18:37 maybe twitter i won't feel so lonely you know but i mean it's even you know but that's a lie too
01:18:43 because twitter is bullshit you know yeah it's i've like purposely put my phone away for a while
01:18:49 and i've gone like a couple days without any social media and there is like a kind of zen that returns
01:18:54 that i haven't felt since i was like 12 before phones existed i'm like ah there were times you
01:18:59 could just literally be alone because like it's a totally different feeling having your phone on you
01:19:04 than not because like you feel like especially when you're someone like me who's like a fucking
01:19:09 shut and neat and like all your friends are through online so it feels like everybody is
01:19:13 with you and nobody's with you at the same time all the time so to actually be alone and to cut
01:19:19 that part off and have no computer and no phone around you just like oh i'm like alive again
01:19:25 almost yeah it's like a different way of thinking that was i think it's been months since i've gone
01:19:29 a day without checking twitter um you should do what i do i i have uh app block on my phone and i
01:19:37 have said it that i am allowed to use twitter for 60 seconds every day and then it gets blocked for
01:19:43 the entire day so i always like every time i wake up i'm like 60 yeah i go to twitter i'm like okay
01:19:48 what's on twitter and then oh oh that's right i'm blocking it and then i forget about it and it's
01:19:54 great i get to do that little uh i'm waking up and i need to check twitter like i do every day
01:19:59 but then it immediately goes away it's it's it's actually quite cool that is awesome because i i
01:20:07 struggle with addiction in general you know like i was saying earlier you know the addiction runs in
01:20:12 my family it's you know it was really bad growing up but yeah like uh you know so i read books on
01:20:20 how to deal with addiction and uh one of the things they say is that like you know the difference
01:20:26 between a habit and an addiction is this feeling of um of despair like of hopelessness right and
01:20:32 you know you feel that hopelessness and then you could get control you know by turning to your
01:20:37 addiction you know and you know i couldn't you know i completely feel you know it's like i feel
01:20:43 utterly alone in the universe i'll go on twitter where people are you know and i was like i i you
01:20:49 know i haven't gone a day without twitter and i can't remember the last time you know yeah it's uh
01:20:55 it's ridiculous yeah i mean every time i go on twitter like i kind of i took a break from twitter
01:21:02 i think last month or the month before for a week and then i came back and i've just noticed
01:21:08 almost every time i go on twitter i feel worse than i did before because there's always something
01:21:13 that's on my timeline that like is annoying or insulting or unfortunate or like i'm just i
01:21:19 just find myself doom scrolling because it's 2020 and that's all the timeline is i'm just like
01:21:24 like i need this because this is my primary platform where i interact with like my audience
01:21:28 but at the same time it's a net negative on my mental state always it's like why do i do this
01:21:36 see you know and for me it's like uh it's it's kind of a mix right you know kind of like i like uh
01:21:42 i use the cannabis too right you know and like a little bit of weed right will help me and make
01:21:48 me feel good and like you know just a little bit and then i'll get more productive i'll come up with
01:21:52 ideas and stuff but then like i get sucked in and then i start doing i smoke too much weed well i
01:21:57 don't smoke it i eat it usually but um and then it stops working well for me you know and then
01:22:03 it's just like it doesn't feel good anymore you know i feel like twitter's the same way for me
01:22:08 like a little bit you know like i get that interaction you know i have some funny conversations
01:22:15 i actually connect to people i have kind of the same thing i kind of do the same thing with booze
01:22:21 i'll take if i have like a shot or something or half a shot sometimes it makes me a little more like
01:22:27 a little more willing to like sit down and like you know like draw something whereas like otherwise
01:22:33 i might like overthink it and be like no i don't want to i don't want to do that i don't want to
01:22:36 draw that no i'm i'm nervous it'll be bad or like oh what if i what if i fuck it up and it's a waste
01:22:40 of time uh and then i get drunk and then i just pass out and then i hung over the next day it is
01:22:46 an unfortunate pet and it's a disaster yeah yeah like like was that you who said you were hung over
01:22:53 today yes yeah i feel better now that's good yes thank you
01:23:03 uh where were we what's going on where am i i don't know i'm sorry i brought up addiction
01:23:09 i don't know i brought up addiction oh sure and feeling alone and all this i don't know i
01:23:13 like talking about stuff that's like hard for people to talk about so i make the room silent
01:23:17 a lot of times no it's it's real shit i mean we don't we don't rule talked about it before
01:23:23 yeah we're no we're no strangers to interesting depth conversations like that it's not
01:23:28 doesn't have to be all fluff so i mean i deal with it all the time it's like that depression
01:23:34 and just the feeling of just like inadequacy and like comparing yourself and like it's that's like
01:23:39 really the thing with social media right is it's it's uh social media and patreon have like put a
01:23:46 number to your success in a very clear manner and so it's very easy to compare yourself to others
01:23:54 right like i can look at anybody that i like and you can just break it down to numbers like they are
01:23:59 ex followers better than me they are ex patrons better than me uh you know their ex engagement
01:24:05 better than me and they shove all that in our face too it's like when you write on that's the first
01:24:11 thing you see you know and then people pretend and then people pretend no that stuff doesn't matter
01:24:18 it doesn't just some people i'm sure it doesn't i mean some people if you have like a lot of
01:24:21 shit going on in the real world and you have like a career and blah blah blah i'm sure like
01:24:25 twitter doesn't faze you because like you're busy like going into the office and getting
01:24:29 shit done and being like a real cog in the machine i don't know what that's like i'm sure it's grand
01:24:34 quote unquote but like if you're in it if you're trying to like be successful and you're trying
01:24:38 to be an artist like the way to be an artist or creative person now is to go on social media
01:24:42 and whore yourself out for views and clicks and it's just like that's a metric that's like your
01:24:47 guidepost for how well you're doing and it's like the people say don't compare yourself to others
01:24:52 but i'm always feeling at the same time i don't know how i'm doing the only way to measure if i'm
01:24:56 like doing well and to course correct is to look at that information and compartmentalize it and
01:25:01 like analyze it and try and like course correct when things are bad and things like that and it's
01:25:05 just like it makes something that started out as just pure passion very monotonous and mechanical
01:25:14 and it almost doesn't feel worth it at that point and then you want to reject that and just like
01:25:18 fuck it i'm gonna just do what i want to do but then it's like oh now i have no money and now i'm
01:25:23 dying so it's just like uh gross yikes yikes yikes you gotta give the people what they want and
01:25:35 high doses yeah seriously it's like quality and quantity on point 24 7 every day it's never be
01:25:43 wrong don't you have to be correct yeah constantly if you disappear for a week the algorithm forgets
01:25:49 about you and then you got to start all over again i i like being nobody i like being somebody who's
01:25:56 just sort of like pretty cool like niche like but not even like a large niche just sort of like
01:26:01 like you know one of these days i'll start my career but not yet and i i guess i have i literally
01:26:08 just want a cult following and like a literal cult i just want to have like 10 people who give me
01:26:12 $10,000 that's fine that's fine with that i guess i i guess that i i like some aspects of being
01:26:20 niche but uh mostly i just hate being a small fish in a big pond and i just want to get big and crush
01:26:25 my enemies you mean physically i just want to be more i want to well sure yeah obviously um i just
01:26:32 want to be i just want to like wield power and destroy those who oppose me that's that's just
01:26:39 that's why that's why i get into this whole internet creator game nice good good for you hope
01:26:44 of you you've reached your dreams i just it's you know i feel i don't know man i feel i see
01:26:54 i follow all these people on twitter who like you know i like the stuff they say i like the
01:26:58 stuff they post and i'm like oh these guys are cool i like these guys oh some of them are like
01:27:02 friends with each other they they taught they tweeted each other like oh that's cool that's
01:27:06 funny to see and then i'm like oh i am like nothing to these people i am like an i'm an ant
01:27:11 i'm like a one i'm like a two percent of like their power level on the internet uh and it's it's
01:27:19 something very demoralizing huh what you mean something to me yeah well how many followers
01:27:26 you got um nothing i've i've got good followers they they count you know you know you know when
01:27:36 when i get in that comparing mindset it's very it hurts it makes me feel bad and just makes me want
01:27:41 like i must i must accrue power i must accrue social capital you know well just just compare
01:27:48 yourself to your past self instead of other people think think of t-bap been yeah but my past
01:27:56 self made 90 like 10 times oh no don't think of that t-bap and the fucking base oh yeah that's it
01:28:03 so uh you know i speak comparing myself to i was i was i uh you know for some reason because i
01:28:11 was in a nuzlocking mood yesterday i went and i watched a little bit i watched the finale of uh
01:28:17 nuzlock uh genocide again and i i think i mentioned this on a stream recently but like
01:28:23 i can't believe how how different i sounded my voice is like markedly different in like that
01:28:28 era i'm like bad at like maintaining the breath control i'm like there's parts where i'm like
01:28:35 almost like gasping and like my voice sounds so like it sounds deeper but also like more
01:28:42 it's it's weird it's it's strange to hear like such a clear difference it's only like
01:28:47 i don't know exactly when it stopped but there's like a pre that and a post that that like era
01:28:53 in in like my stuff and i don't know exactly when the transition happened uh it's it's really
01:28:59 working on a podcast you probably end up you know just learning the way that you're supposed to
01:29:03 talk like you know halfway through these podcasts i got super i'm like insecure i'm like oh my god i
01:29:08 sound like an idiot i'm yelling i'm like seeing you know i i come off as trashy probably i don't
01:29:14 know that's like what i was you know thinking halfway through this thing i'm like it probably
01:29:19 do it i i blew it i fucking blew it um did she blow it guys no no did you blow it okay all right
01:29:28 commenters let us know if she blew it you know i got all passionate about like people being mean
01:29:33 to me and i'm like
01:29:39 we have plenty of mean people in the comments uh so you know actually our our commenters well
01:29:46 i mean they're not you know they're not great but they're i think they're okay you know i think
01:29:49 they're maybe a little above yeah they're below par they need to step up their game okay okay commenters
01:29:56 flex how cool you are in the comments you have to flex your brain you have to do more controversial
01:30:02 stuff you have to get controversial guests on and they have to say like extreme things and you
01:30:08 have to have we have to get alex jones sort of get out it goes straight to alex jones the most
01:30:14 extreme possible we could do it are any of you folks are any of you folks old enough to remember
01:30:22 when that guy was just like about aliens and like very mild conspiracies like before he was like
01:30:28 i might be old enough but i used to watch all of his documentaries on youtube and i
01:30:32 thought they were hilarious like the one where he's like i've infiltrated bohemian grove and
01:30:37 like all this crazy shit oh man i was i was into alex jones before he was cool i i love that crap
01:30:43 as a kid you know because i was like man fuck these rich people you know like you know it's like
01:30:52 you know they do weird ceremonies and stuff like they're controlling the world eating babies
01:30:58 demon spawn yeah i never really uh looked at build a bird group and the trilateral commission
01:31:04 are controlling everything i've only ever seen clips of him just problem but that's enough and
01:31:09 he's very funny from what i've seen crazy man he's a treat he's a joy we we should have and then he
01:31:16 turned into like yeah get him on buy my pills oh but then yeah but then he got into the right wing
01:31:23 grift so he know yeah that's where the money is i guess because i know is there any left wing
01:31:31 grifters is that i'm sure there's some bends are left for ingrifter bends uh doing something with
01:31:39 his mic i guess ben's mic is muted so i could say that and i know you wouldn't say anything back
01:31:43 i'm back uh i am a big big time grifter uh i just want and i want to be bigger i just want to be
01:31:50 the biggest grifter i can be um uh you know man there's a are there left wing grifters either
01:31:57 there probably are kind of depends kind of depends on how you define grifter i feel like people throw
01:32:03 that word around a lot i feel like there's some people on who are like formerly in like the
01:32:08 skeptic community who are now left leaning and some people say that's a grift and not like a legitimate
01:32:13 change of opinion yeah i don't know like i don't know if you wanted to do it for money i mean there's
01:32:18 way more money in in the right wing like i mean is maybe not for everyone yeah yeah like um tim
01:32:27 tim pool has become the fucking goblin that he is now because like of info wars money oh as uh as
01:32:34 he's associated with info wars now tim pool not he i was asking i asked someone about this in my
01:32:41 discord and i guess uh uh info wars like funded him to do something i don't know i was asking like
01:32:49 why did he i was asking like was he always like this and i guess the answer is no and there was
01:32:53 like he he did he did some shit for info wars for a while holy shit yeah i didn't i didn't know that
01:32:59 i i don't know much about it even now because i can't give you any details like as in peace
01:33:06 he's so big and he's so bad he's so i think he might be my most hated person in the entire world
01:33:12 i know that probably in the grants i i'm not i'm not joking i know that in the grand scheme of
01:33:18 things there's probably worse people and people who are worse for the world but in terms of just
01:33:22 like how much i viscerally hate them i think he might be it he's he's really he's really
01:33:28 climbing the ranks every single time apparently apparently vosh is going to his studio to debate
01:33:35 in real life and i'm excited it's going to be a fun time did you see that whole the whole thing
01:33:40 about how he kept he kept like he refused to like uh leftist won't debate me and then like all these
01:33:46 people would but he's like no i won't do it on a call i haven't i haven't you only you can only do
01:33:53 content in like three years well people were retweeting it because he kept like saying like
01:33:57 no no debate me no no debate me but he's like he won't do it over he won't do it remotely he you
01:34:01 have to like travel across the country to come and do it in studio and it's like why yeah why would
01:34:07 you do this if you heard about they catch covid and die on the way so we can win by default i don't
01:34:13 know i did hear that vosh was going to do that it's funny she just wanted to make it as unlikely
01:34:18 as possible that a leftist would actually try to debate him and so that he continued to say
01:34:22 that leftists won't debate me all these commies don't have any money that's why they're commies so
01:34:27 they came in afford to come here he's not he's not a smart individual and i don't think he can defend
01:34:33 himself against i mean i i think i used to watch tim pool like back in like 2017 or something and
01:34:40 he was still a pretty small channel and he definitely was not the same kind of duty as now like like
01:34:46 him and sargon have shifted so far right in the last couple years where like they were they were like
01:34:52 misguided but palatable to a degree when you're like a fucking
01:34:57 a centrist right kind of person like i am but like i listen to their content now they're not
01:35:02 even the same person wait oh my god tom you're you're a centrist right person i mean centrist left
01:35:08 my bed that's the that's the opposite yeah yeah i said the wrong thing i'm i'm definitely more
01:35:14 the left guy i'm like a sock kind of dude everyone should everyone should just become
01:35:18 communists malibu is like literally ready to kill me it's like oh we're gonna go to
01:35:24 i was gonna be like oh my gosh i can't believe you know because like i don't i feel like you're
01:35:28 really cool i grew up conservative christian so i guess at one point i was centrist right
01:35:33 i have a friend i have a friend who who calls him he's if you ask him he'll like call himself
01:35:39 kind of like right leaning but like the thing about him is that i don't know i think is that he
01:35:45 he strikes me as like genuinely apolitical and i think what he means when he says that is just
01:35:51 that he's like trad he just you know wants like you know white picket fence wife two and a half
01:35:55 kids and a dog or whatever like whenever like politics comes up he doesn't like he doesn't
01:36:01 say the things that you that i would associate with someone who calls himself that he's like
01:36:06 i don't know he talks about like uh you know how like oh like uh uh uh yeah vietnam had like a really
01:36:12 effective like a public housing uh you know infrastructure or something like i don't he's
01:36:16 interested in that kind of stuff so i don't know it's it's uh i think i don't know or i don't know
01:36:24 who's vietnam he he's an architecture student and he was talking about how like you know like some
01:36:29 some like southeast asian countries like compared in terms of like how they had like you know solved
01:36:34 the housing crisis with like public options and whatever uh i don't know the point is like he i don't
01:36:40 know i think it's interesting but like yeah he he will say that he's right leading but i don't think
01:36:45 i don't even think he is and that's why he's still my friend lemau see this is the thing i i'm beginning
01:36:52 to notice that like people like they love leftist policies like when they're in action you know
01:36:58 but they hate they hate our guts they you know and it's because it's obvious for fucking you
01:37:03 know like the left is just filled with like smug we're better than you assholes you know
01:37:08 and uh you know i think that turns off a lot of people you know like yeah um i mean people people
01:37:15 people think libs people think libs are the left and it's very frustrating it's a very you see all
01:37:20 over the place and again i said this before i'm not sure if they don't understand or if they're
01:37:24 like deliberate if deliberately misrepresentation i think it's definitely a little i would imagine
01:37:29 they don't understand because i didn't understand until a few years ago or maybe maybe even just one
01:37:36 or two years ago language like i didn't understand the left because the only things i had seen
01:37:41 were videos by um people dunking on feminists and i thought yeah this feminism stuff is silly
01:37:48 that it's it's it's worse in in uh countries in the other places in the world not in the western
01:37:54 world and like you know i've just bought into that because i didn't see the alternative side
01:37:59 once i had i was like oh well there's there's there's there's more to it than i thought
01:38:05 we'll see the uh do you see the debate the last debate i have never seen such a thing ever
01:38:10 never will i i i actually i actually did watch this one i thought it would be funny it wasn't
01:38:15 that funny uh but there was the part where it's depressing yeah i kind of like the part where
01:38:21 trump said that the kamala harris was like more he said more liberal than bernie sanders it's like
01:38:27 okay uh he's like uh i mean i get that is that is true technically more yeah you're not the way he
01:38:34 meant it though yeah yeah i know well that's uh sure uh i don't know and uh i wouldn't wouldn't
01:38:40 wouldn't recommend uh it was very um boring but it wasn't that long yeah i was just gonna say you
01:38:47 know um i i find all of the drama in in the left really interesting you know um i like because like
01:38:54 i don't know the people in my circles on social media they hate all of the youtube leftist people
01:39:00 they just despise them all you know you know yeah i get that i don't know i i i think uh i like
01:39:11 them i like you lefty i like bread tube what there i said it you know even though i don't i don't
01:39:17 watch as much so i don't watch as much of it as i as i was for a while because i feel like i've
01:39:21 reached the point where i kind of get it but for a while there i was down the rabbit hole and i was
01:39:26 like yeah this is cool i'm glad people are saying this shit you know i i definitely don't hate any of
01:39:34 them i uh i i uh you know i have their videos on in the background a lot of times when i draw
01:39:41 and stuff like that you know because i mean you know what else am i going to listen to you know
01:39:45 yeah but yeah it's like it's funny how like you know it's like i don't know like every like
01:39:54 there's groups of people who hate fosh and then like you know there's everyone hates
01:39:58 contra points and then everyone you know like god you know are we all we're all riding with
01:40:03 biden right we're all riding with biden hell yeah choo choo choo the biden train is leaving
01:40:09 the station i'm lucky that i don't need to yeah you know i've never voted uh for a democrat for
01:40:15 president in my life it's always been third party yeah well i mean i i've lived in states
01:40:21 i live in i've only lived in blue states like i grew up in chicago and like yeah and 2008 right
01:40:28 i was like a nadir person you know like uh yeah yeah you know someone spit on me once uh in chicago
01:40:35 uh when they saw my nadir pin yeah it was during 2008 when things were you know yeah i got spit on
01:40:41 for wearing a nadir pin it was pretty intense uh i love uh walking around uh in my yang shirt uh my
01:40:49 yang 2020 shirt is going to be a uh a treasured possession of mine uh for the rest of my life
01:40:56 i hope really a yang man oh Jesus no okay for like i had like a two week period where i heard
01:41:02 about yang and thought he was pretty cool and then i was quickly disillusioned and realized he's
01:41:07 kind of just a libertarian tech bro and uh and that his ubi was a little like i kind of like the idea
01:41:15 but like his version of it is like the worst version of it uh so no but kind of but only briefly
01:41:22 no i'm sorry i apologize i apologize for my if anyone sees me wearing my yang shirt i'm sorry
01:41:30 you know it's it's funny how like everyone just argues about like these individuals you're like
01:41:35 oh yang or oh bernie or like how oh the the dnc screwed over bernie i'm like they didn't screw
01:41:41 over bernie bernie's fine they screwed over us that's who they screwed over sure you know
01:41:47 you know like like you know all these politicians they might be different but at the end of the day
01:41:53 they're on the same side you know what i mean like even bernie is like a wealthy dude who benefits
01:42:00 from all this stuff you know and like yeah he's become biden's little bitch and uh you know and
01:42:07 so it like it makes me angry you know and that's the thing i wanted i wanted bernie
01:42:11 you know but like the thing is it's it's it's not bernie it's not him it's us you know that's the
01:42:17 thing it's not you know it's not me us not me us yeah you know and i i really think that
01:42:24 people should take that kind of stuff to heart you know like they didn't you know the bernie
01:42:27 bros are just so they they screwed bernie and poor bernie and then it's like no poor us that dude
01:42:33 has health care you know like and he's never gonna not have health care we're the ones who need
01:42:38 the health care you know i think 150 thousand years old had a heart attack and made it through
01:42:42 so like his health care must be doing great i think that's fair i think that's that's that's
01:42:47 perfectly fair and true yeah keep it keep it in perspective i guess yeah yeah i think i'd probably
01:42:54 fall for that trap sometimes i mean we make it we make it all about the individuals so much you
01:43:01 know like you know we get mad at like one one person for you know their stupid shoplifting
01:43:07 comic you know but not at like you know the system that maybe might have drove this character to
01:43:14 shoplift you know what i mean it's easier to target individuals for our simple monkey brains
01:43:19 to wrap around the concept so reality tv people want to see the different face as the president
01:43:28 yeah the what they're gonna do is like not as easy to most people now edit it in again
01:43:36 oh the burp you guys don't keep burps then uh not anymore as of right now they're no longer
01:43:45 included yeah new policy uh what are we talking about we're talking about president oh we're
01:43:53 biden biden biden
01:43:58 we got we've got our soul the soul of america guys yeah back to brunch everybody let's go back
01:44:05 to brunch yes i saw a left tube bread tube uh person called lonely box uh who who made a video
01:44:17 about racism in the uk and i thought that was a pretty good video never heard of them because there's
01:44:21 not a lot of like talking about yeah he's i think it was quite small uh i will grab the link and put
01:44:28 it but i liked it because it's like you know i'm from the uk and there's not a lot of of like i
01:44:36 guess h bomber guy but he's a bit wacky funny oh i love the h bomber guy he's such a sweetie
01:44:43 he's all right he's nice i it's just his his his brand of comedy is a bit loud i like i like

01:45:23 i uh uh so uh i uh made slash run sort of this game this discord game called uh endless war
01:45:34 which is in which in which uh people compete for a slime-based currency uh and uh i like
01:45:39 thoughts lime so much that in my in my in my gang i don't know how to explain it in my gang
01:45:46 headquarters in uh in universe i made a a secret room that is called the uh the radicalization
01:45:53 station which was just it's just all of thoughts limes videos uh and i thought that that was pretty
01:45:59 funny and i wish you would notice me uh and uh and play uh uh play slime games with me
01:46:08 thoughts thought slime put uh my shoplifting comic in one of his videos um actually it was
01:46:14 like just a split second i think i may have seen that a split second and i got so excited it was
01:46:19 this video where he was actually apologizing for another video i guess i didn't get to see the
01:46:25 video he apologized for because he took it down but uh basically this video he i guess it was really
01:46:31 mean spirit or something and so he apologized for it but in the video he's all like everyone's jumping
01:46:37 up this person's ass to apologize for this comic which is ridiculous this comic is awesome
01:46:43 and then you know and then went on to apologize for his thing so it's not even one of his
01:46:48 very good videos it's kind of boring just watching him apologize but you know i was like ah he
01:46:53 noticed me for a second yeah ben have you ever reached out to thought slime that's sick as fuck
01:47:00 huh have you ever reached out to thought slime i sent him i sent him an email or wait um

01:47:14 peter coffin it's peter coffin that's they i forget okay um so thought slime i sent thought
01:47:19 slime an email uh because he asks for you know um rent send me the the the the the the eyeball
01:47:27 zone uh thing yeah left his project the eyeball zone i sent him an email thinking that maybe uh
01:47:34 endless war kind of qualifies uh i don't know it does and i perceived no response so either
01:47:41 he didn't or he picks i mean it's it's not really much of a of an overtly leftist anything it's just
01:47:47 a funny slime game video game yeah i thought he would at least think it was cool i am in his um
01:47:54 or i was in his discord but like i didn't really do much in there i just kind of was in there and
01:47:59 was like okay i'm in uh i'm still in there i don't even remember you try to get peter coffin on here
01:48:07 no okay no no uh no i'm talking about thought slime okay all you mentioned the peter coffin for
01:48:14 a second uh no i just i uh peter i just because both of them i don't know they both kind of look
01:48:23 alike i guess and they both go by they and sometimes i forget which one's which uh but not
01:48:29 usually because they're different lol um okay that's so that's that what what else guys
01:48:37 yeah let's let's let's ride we're riding with biden we're riding with biden here i just want to
01:48:44 i can't stress enough how hard i'm right i think uh i think biden's gonna win i think it's
01:48:51 gonna be oh sure yeah yeah he's gonna that seems that seems to be where the wind is blowing
01:48:59 yeah it's it's good it's good it's gonna be a weird you know and it's it's it's kind of funny
01:49:05 too because it's like he's biden's gonna win based on what he's not going to do
01:49:11 they you know like oh he's not going to you know be as bad you know yeah that's what that's what
01:49:19 they do they're all they're all like i don't know i saw i think i saw shon oh i love shon
01:49:23 by the way if we're talking about lefty lefty tutors yes shon is a shon is sick as fuck um
01:49:30 i can never make it through shon's video is too boring for me oh no there that's that's what i like
01:49:35 that's what i like yeah i love videos that suck that's true i agree um uh i think he oh god what
01:49:46 was i talking about he retweeted something that was like um oh it was like a video of like
01:49:53 they're interviewing they're interviewing some a couple of like black women about how they're like
01:49:57 they're not convinced to vote biden and the the headline is like these women aren't convinced
01:50:04 about biden despite all the things trump has done and it's like well those aren't the same thing uh
01:50:12 you know the the it's like well shouldn't shouldn't biden have to do shouldn't what
01:50:17 biden does enter into it in some way you know what one would think yeah it's like that thing
01:50:23 we're like you know i don't know what's like it's like someone will hear me trashing liberals and
01:50:28 they're like yeah uh you know you're a republican right i'm like god no ew gross yeah you know
01:50:34 yeah it's like i hate liberals with all my heart but uh uh i'm not a conservative at all uh there
01:50:43 yeah well you know that's why we we gotta reach across the aisle we gotta reach across the aisle
01:50:48 and bring the far right over based on our shared hatred of liberals that's the thing we can all
01:50:52 agree on um i don't know i don't know if that's i don't think i don't know if i actually believe
01:50:59 that uh huh i don't think people agree with that at all i don't know i don't know if i actually
01:51:04 even agree with that it's probably not it's probably not actually gonna work that well
01:51:08 i mean i'm sure some of them you know like i don't know i wouldn't be surprised if there's
01:51:13 folks out there that like you know they just see like you know like these liberals on the tv and
01:51:18 radio and they're like shut up college boy you know like what's the alternative you know is oh
01:51:23 conservatives you know like yeah like you know what i mean like i know exactly because you know we
01:51:30 don't have like you know like far right discourse is acceptable in the mainstream media but not far
01:51:38 left you know it's like it goes as far bernie is as far as it goes and i might you know in my eyes
01:51:44 he's kind of like you know a centrist leaning to the left you know it's like not really change much
01:51:52 if you're if you're far far right discourse doesn't threaten capitalism whereas far left stuff does
01:51:58 and every establishment media source is pro capitalism so they're not gonna platform that
01:52:04 shit if you're some moron uh watching you're watching television and you're like uh well no
01:52:12 not you don't even i'm not even to say you have to be a moron but if you're just a person watching
01:52:17 television watching the news and you're like boy liberals sure are smug and hypocritical
01:52:24 and suck you know you rightly come to that conclusion and then you're like yeah and then
01:52:28 you're thinking what's the alternative like the visible alternative you know is conservatism uh uh
01:52:34 who who who you know yeah they don't people don't acknowledge that the left is even real and to
01:52:40 a large extent it's not we don't have an organized left in america uh to the extent that they do in
01:52:44 other countries japan has a communist party i want i want that i want that i think it's easy
01:52:53 like in our bubbles to think that we're a bigger deal than you know we really are you know what i
01:52:58 mean like yeah you know but it's sad it's it's and it's there's not very many of us like you know
01:53:06 it's in the grand scheme of things yeah that's true yeah i think i think destiny was talking
01:53:10 about at one point breaking down like oh yeah like there's a ton of like you know super left
01:53:15 people on twitter but twitter is like one percent of the population and like only like a couple percent
01:53:20 of twitter would be like really far left so like you're talking about a fraction of percent of the
01:53:25 american population actually believes these things so you're but you're so insular on twitter it feels
01:53:31 like there's this big movement you know and it's not really there yeah and like but but and the
01:53:39 mainstream media you know it's like we have no history about like labor it's like this you know
01:53:43 label rights you know people don't even know what mayday is about or you know yeah you know or any
01:53:49 of that kind of stuff and uh yeah you know so you know it's i think it's easy to write off these
01:53:56 right wingers is like you know people call them stupid all the time or they call them all bigots
01:54:01 you know and uh you know i'm and a lot of them are that you know a lot of them are just they they
01:54:08 hate trans people that they're a lot of them are obsessively hate trans people for some reason
01:54:13 it's it's kind of weird isn't it have you noticed that like yes they're always talking about us
01:54:17 it's so yes they're very there's there's a certain yeah there's a segment of the population that's
01:54:22 really fixated it's kind of weird you know and they're like they we shouldn't have rights because
01:54:28 they're barely a fraction of the population i'm like well if we're barely a fraction of the
01:54:32 population then why are you so fucking concerned like you know whether we get like the healthcare
01:54:38 or like you know we use the fucking toilet you know jesus i um you ever you ever venture on the
01:54:45 kiwi farms you're jealous you ever venture on the kiwi farms i have a page there uh you know
01:54:53 just for my own mental health i do not look at it because yeah it's like i mean back in the day
01:55:00 like i used to look at it you know um and it just like always made me feel bad or you know
01:55:07 you know and yeah the level of disc you know i the level of discourse there that i have seen
01:55:13 is very it's very weird the tone that like every thread takes the tone is always very like
01:55:21 the it's it's it's it's always like um i don't know it's it's so scoldy it's so
01:55:27 scoldy and coppish and like like i don't know the conclusion that they always seem to come to
01:55:33 about these people that they you know really hate and really want to like say bad things about just
01:55:39 you know for whatever reason the conclusion that seems like they always come to is like oh
01:55:43 this person should have just like stuck to the straight and narrow this person should have like
01:55:48 you know uh uh you know just like maintained his traditional western values uh or whatever
01:55:55 i don't know there's like a really strong like sort of traditionalist like
01:55:59 enforcement's mentality there that like anything that someone anything bad about someone is because
01:56:05 they deviated from like the the the the norm i don't know that's uh that's something i noticed
01:56:11 going on there and i think it's very weird oh yeah hey by the way like you know during that whole
01:56:17 like harassment thing you know like uh when my own community was turning at me when i needed
01:56:21 the most i was getting doxed they those fuckers doxed me based yeah yeah yeah terrible uh
01:56:31 yeah they're they're weirdos it's it's weird the tone there is very strange uh like uh you know
01:56:39 the one thing the kiwi farm is like they can't they keep comparing me you know i don't know if
01:56:45 they do this anymore because i haven't like looked at that page in a while but they keep
01:56:48 comparing me to this other transgender comic artist named sophie labelle who does this um
01:56:56 sophie labelle yeah she does this comic called assigned mail it's it's like this kind of like
01:57:01 cuddle party like oh i know i know assigned mail i know yeah it's just like it's all like uh transphobia
01:57:08 is bad yay you know that kind of stuff you know which is fine you know like you know sign people
01:57:14 yeah but uh you know for some reason that they always compare me to her for some reason like
01:57:20 you know like uh well it's because they're they're really fixated on on that on that aspect of
01:57:27 people and like that's all reducing people down to a label it's stupid it's pretty it's pretty bad
01:57:35 i don't know you know uh i mean i i was familiar with kiwi farms because uh famously i'm a big uh
01:57:41 i'm a big christorian i'm a i'm a big i'm a big time youtube uh sonichu man
01:57:47 the the thread on chris is like particularly bad like the the the thread on on on christine is like
01:57:55 almost like weird and like they can't type or spell and it's like i don't know what's going on there
01:58:03 it's like they're seething it's like literal children are the only ones like in that discussion
01:58:10 anymore or like people who just like can't fucking use a computer correctly i don't understand i do not
01:58:17 understand uh that um yeah and then everywhere else it's just very like hmm you see this person uh
01:58:23 um this this youtuber uh he has you know uh lost subscribers because they uh they didn't uh i don't
01:58:30 know they didn't uh uh get out of there because they're gay or something they didn't they didn't
01:58:38 i don't know whatever they're degenerates they're yeah that's that that's what i was trying to
01:58:42 say this person is degenerate here's here's why that word that word is so weird it's it's they
01:58:48 constantly use it and and like yeah that's what it means is that you deviated from this like
01:58:55 this normal this like normative idea that they're like kind of obsessed with
01:58:59 and like anyone anyone boring yeah i don't know i feel like do you think like kiwi farms comes
01:59:05 i mean i always associate kiwi farms with like 4chan right like like kind of like a similar
01:59:09 sort of crowd of just like people who kind of like take the piss out of like other people online and
01:59:14 like you know like making fun of like deviance i suppose and it feels like yeah 4chan's very much
01:59:20 like an anonymous sort of thing right and so like being anonymous means like blending in and like not
01:59:25 not sticking out or anything and so if you're like really big into anonymity like you would you would
01:59:31 want to pull back people who stand out from the crowd and i feel like maybe that's kind of part
01:59:36 of what it is is like if you're kind of coming from that background that like anybody who like is
01:59:42 deviant goes against what you kind of have self-identified as i definitely wouldn't say taking
01:59:48 the piss out of like these kiwi farms people just pick on small-time trans artists a lot you know like
01:59:54 you know it or like oh my gosh that antoons guy you know like how they went after that you know
02:00:00 like you know and like i saw i saw this thing like antoons was saying that like like this puppy
02:00:07 chan they have all this power and like dude they have like less than 60 000 followers on twitter
02:00:13 you know like your antoons is like antoons has like a million fucking subscribers on youtube
02:00:21 have you have you seen his youtube channel i only vaguely understood this antoons debacle
02:00:27 but like here like he's making a video about me right now wait really yeah someone leaked stuff
02:00:35 from his discord he is gonna he's making a video either with just me in it or about being or something
02:00:41 like that so um antoons videos are so strange like his biggest videos are like the it's like
02:00:50 deathbed scenes of like popular cartoon characters there's like i think his biggest one is like
02:00:55 homer simpson's deathbed and like friend flinstone is there and it's like it's like everyone's just
02:01:01 crying and like i don't understand it at all it's it's really weird i guess it's i guess it's meant
02:01:08 to be funny like you think so i guess it's common in a meta way i guess 129 million views sonic funeral
02:01:18 yeah that's what that's what he does but that's what he did before he decided to be like a
02:01:24 fucking bigot on twitter professionally lol yeah what is with that like all of you know these like
02:01:30 people have like a decent career all of a sudden like get irked by trans people and then that's
02:01:34 like what they become about you know is like yeah they're fucking pussies they're scared of the big
02:01:39 boogie man who's gonna you know femboy eyes them with the femboy ray and like no i don't want to
02:01:46 do any of that i don't want to oh they're taking over everything oh it's just it's hysteria
02:01:54 yeah they don't know anything about anything and then i assume that antoons i assumed that
02:02:00 antoons was just one of the cadre of people who just wants to be another stone toss and we'll just
02:02:05 like you have a little cottage industry that sprung up about like just get trying to like
02:02:09 make a comic that gets retweeted by stone toss and then and then you know a couple thousand at
02:02:14 least a couple thousand people will be like yeah i'll follow this guy because i like what he's saying
02:02:18 um and uh but no he's he's already huge on youtube and he's still up to this weird shit

02:02:52 no that's the thing well i mean like our culture is so not not this not this one here our culture
02:02:59 is so youth obsessed you know it's like you know like it's like once you had 30 you know you turned
02:03:04 on the tv and stuff you're like oh my gosh like all these tv shows and movies are about people
02:03:08 who are younger than me now you know right yeah you never notice it when you you're growing up
02:03:13 but like every protagonist of most things is like from like 15 to 24 25 most cloud
02:03:22 cloud strife is like 18 no cloud strife is in his 20s that's the the one weird exception
02:03:30 wait really no wait no it's it's um he's okay he's 21 okay well squall is like 18 yeah a lot of
02:03:38 protagonist i mean luffy luffy monkey d luffy only 17 at the start that's just like he and he was
02:03:45 considered old like naruto is like 15 or whatever yeah i think he's 13 in the original or i don't
02:03:52 know he's a young lad uh yeah yeah yeah fuck it yeah well you know it's like fun and like our
02:04:00 color we're just so mean to old people too like all the time like you know it's it's uh old people's
02:04:05 opinions don't matter we shove them into homes we just you know wait for them to die you know
02:04:11 in fairness though boomers are the worst generation uh and deserve it well you know i listen you know
02:04:19 i feel like you know boomers they grew up with a lot of lead they you know i yeah yeah i know
02:04:27 it's the lead to a certain extent they totally is the lead like you know like they have like
02:04:33 no empathy they're they're quick to like be angry at at weird shit for no reason you know i i honestly
02:04:40 feel bad for a lot of these boomers you know they they don't know what's happening and it's not you
02:04:44 know i like yeah i would feel bad for them if they weren't like actively ruining everything for the
02:04:50 rest yeah that's i know i'm just talking about well you know you know moms and stuff like that i'm
02:04:56 not talking about like you know people's power you know i think that's yeah you know like lady on
02:05:03 the street you know that is like you know not the action they're voting it's the lead it's the lead
02:05:10 the lead is voting for us now the lead wants uh you know the lead wants the wall and it will
02:05:17 have it by any means necessary uh made of lead
02:05:24 you know like my mom is just like it's so hard to get things through her skull you know i have to
02:05:29 tell her over and over again and like she it's like it just does not understand it like anything
02:05:36 you know maybe my mom's just an idiot but um yeah and it's like and i'm just like you know
02:05:43 but really i think it's like she ate lead chips as a kid you know what like yeah i'll do it uh what
02:05:50 was that uh it was just like actually like eight lead chips no oh you know like i don't know because
02:05:56 like back in the day you know paint on the walls was made out of lead and it would chip off and
02:06:02 children would eat it you know and like all the gas was leaded you know like when my mom was a baby
02:06:08 you know i think i don't know and see yeah it's not my fault it's not my fault for that i have
02:06:14 those daddy issues you mentioned it's the lead it's the lead that did it you know that's the
02:06:18 lead that made uh my dad get me uh put me on fucking uh uh adhd and i punched the hole in the
02:06:24 wall it was the lead all along you know it's not it's not me anti-lead we were taking an anti-lead
02:06:31 stance on this podcast now we're pro-circumcision and anti-lead um
02:06:41 wait no we were arguing about that before the last time i i think i came off as being a little
02:06:47 i mean i was doing it on purpose i all i all i wanted to say about the circumcision thing was
02:06:53 that i'm open to being convinced that maybe it's good uh uh not not that i not that i actively
02:06:58 think yes it's good we should do it just that i am available to be persuaded by evidence that
02:07:04 suggests that it is you know how dare you it's not it's not it's not my default my default
02:07:10 position is not we should definitely be circumcising always abc always be circumcising and uh and
02:07:18 you know you got you'll need to you'll need to make a compelling argument uh otherwise to change
02:07:23 my mind it's not like you guys you guys had a podcast about circumcising we got we talked about
02:07:28 last it was yeah based on a voicemail i think right at the end of the discussion about it
02:07:34 yeah um speaking of voicemails i mean we've been going we've been going for two and a half hours
02:07:41 now uh i don't know do you guys i'm sorry was i interested enough that i do okay here i well
02:07:49 i almost feel bad saying it because like i feel like we could keep going uh uh and and yet and yet
02:07:57 the podcast must conclude
02:08:01 eventually i mean we've had long episodes before it's fine and you can also like cut out stuff
02:08:07 you know because there is points oh no no no no no no no no no that's good content that's good
02:08:13 content right there that's not we don't we don't pay we don't pay our editor that much i mean go on
02:08:18 this is a shoestring operation hmm you hear that alia czar get fucked
02:08:25 like honestly this is fun i like like i'm just excited that i get to talk with other people
02:08:32 um this quarantine is naming nuts yeah because you know i'm a high-risk person i had a kidney
02:08:38 transplant you know oh shit oh i had so many bad things happen to me in my life it's uh you
02:08:43 know i can probably write a book about that um you know and so yeah it does suck you know but
02:08:49 whatever i'm it's made me home yeah but yeah so i'm on these uh anti-rejection medications
02:08:55 which lowers my immune system so basically if i get covid you know i also like struggle with
02:09:01 hypertension so if i get the covid there's like a 40 chance that i'm toast oh jesus christ okay yikes
02:09:09 yeah so i don't even hard car lockdown yeah i don't even go to the grocery store i have you
02:09:14 know people bring me the groceries yeah and you know it sucks i'm going crazy i hear i think
02:09:23 if it's driving me bonkers like that's why like you know i mean i i was pretty much i was pretty i
02:09:33 was a little bit of a hermit even before lockdown and lockdown has made me think like i need to like
02:09:40 once when when normal comes back i should probably like take better advantage of it
02:09:46 and like actually go out and do more things than i used to even you know because like now now i have
02:09:53 to do it and it's like uh you know maybe this isn't uh maybe this isn't the way to live uh yeah it's
02:10:01 not that great um i i i also love just having this podcast and then the streams we do just
02:10:08 it's just nice to talk to people about stuff every every week i'm a people person i need people
02:10:15 i like going out and doing you know i need my alone time too you know like but i just i like
02:10:20 people a whole heckin lot and um yeah and uh so this has been really difficult for me my partner
02:10:29 on the other hand she's like thriving you know she's like has you know you know she's more of an
02:10:34 introvert um you know but it's like you know i'm all itchy and like bouncing around and you know
02:10:42 and she's just like chill i'm i think i'm pretty good i'm pretty good with isolation but you know
02:10:50 enough enough so i'm probably doing better than a lot of people but i i i'm also i'm also pretty
02:10:56 over it uh yeah you know this covered thing and not a big fan honestly uh i could take it to leave
02:11:03 it i guess i thought hey you know it sucks too it's like you know this might not be the first
02:11:09 this might just be the first of uh a few pandemics that we get in the next two decades
02:11:16 yeah it sucks good to think about i know blows but hopefully hopefully not you know
02:11:23 you know and hopefully this thing mutates and hopefully it mutates and it's not as deadly
02:11:29 or you know the vaccine is good or something right right yeah i i feel like optimistically
02:11:37 by the middle of next year there'd be a vaccine out and we'd finally start actually dealing with it
02:11:44 the um i i don't know between the fastest it's gonna be the fastest time it ever took to create
02:11:51 a new vaccine was four years fastest hey yes i think it was malaria no not really i don't remember
02:12:01 there's a lot of new vaccine technology you know where they like just type shit into a computer
02:12:07 it spits out the vaccine why haven't they done that that's um suspicious
02:12:14 i you know i'm simplifying it because i'm an idiot you know i don't really know how
02:12:18 it's probably much more complicated than that mumps it was mumps was the fastest vaccine ever
02:12:24 developed and it took four years in 1967 well yes a while ago i think i can definitely do it first
02:12:30 to now well i mean who knows right well that i guess i guess we'll find out based on all of the
02:12:39 things i've heard from all of the experts saying they're projected um thoughts um it's it's something
02:12:45 that could happen within one or two years so i'm pretty confident that that will be the timescale
02:12:52 if such a thing happens at all like how do they know maybe they are bullshitting but this is the
02:12:59 novel coronavirus it's a new virus like like i don't know maybe they know something i don't
02:13:05 but like how would you how would you be able to be like oh yeah i think this new disease that has
02:13:09 never been researched before i think the timescale for making a vaccine for that should be about uh
02:13:14 like this how would you begin to answer that i think they definitely know more than you do about it
02:13:21 but no you know i don't think so actually it sounds okay all right point taken point taken
02:13:29 experts are really boring yeah is that hard to talk to because they they study all the time they
02:13:34 don't know how to speak in front of cameras on the news i thought you liked boring videos uh i do
02:13:41 but like it's it's it's hard for people to agree and like like really get into something an expert
02:13:48 says because an expert is an expert at their thing and not at speaking yeah i agree that i see people
02:13:56 on my timeline kind of afraid of the vaccine even though they're not like those anti-vaxxer types
02:14:01 you know like afraid of rushing out the vaccine and i would be nervous i would be nervous to take
02:14:07 a vaccine that's like yeah you know like that was new and that hadn't been like tested that much
02:14:13 they would have to have like loads of volunteers be like okay we have something we can try anyone
02:14:19 want to try it and people will be like oh please me and then yes and then they would try it a bunch
02:14:27 and after a few weeks or months we'd we'd have more of an understanding whether it works or not
02:14:32 i feel like what kamala harris said during the the vice president debate was also not a great
02:14:38 thing either she was saying like oh it comes out during a trump presidency i won't take it it's just
02:14:43 oh my god why would you say things like that yeah that was like what does that have to do with it
02:14:49 because she was saying that like if if dr fouching everybody clears it but if it comes out during
02:14:54 a trump administration and trump's the one pushing it i don't want to take it and it's just like weird
02:14:59 like weird trump doesn't have the authority to like clear a fucking you know like he's not going
02:15:03 to be like i did the trump vaccine and i developed it myself but it's just the trump vaccine you know
02:15:10 uh uh he just he just like puts his like fucking name on regeneron or something and
02:15:14 starts hawking it or whatever but like a legitimate vaccine like it's not trump's not the one doing
02:15:19 it so like putting that in people's minds it definitely makes a part it makes a vaccine a
02:15:25 partisan issue which is like not a good idea yeah i was about to say that stupid culture were
02:15:30 bullshit you know that needs to die it's like the uh like the stimulus package like i don't know
02:15:37 like i guess i guess they think that like getting the stimulus package out now like people would
02:15:43 think trump did it but like does anyone think that there wouldn't be a stimulus package under
02:15:46 like biden like does that does anyone really think that like trump is the one doing that and
02:15:51 that if it wouldn't happen without him you know what i mean it just seems like no it's congress
02:15:57 is doing that am i right yeah i'm right yeah yeah of course you're right you know yeah okay hell yeah
02:16:03 you know it's it's the culture war thing you know it's like yeah you know it's either bad or good
02:16:10 i don't remember kamala saying that that's what seems like a really bizarre statement
02:16:16 i must have missed it i was like what the isn't she like a cop or something too
02:16:23 yeah she's the the the da like the oh god i don't know she was a da somewhere and yeah she uh you
02:16:31 know she did some uh uh she kept some uh some people in jail uh for no reason uh yeah she
02:16:38 prosecuted a bunch of uh you know people probably shouldn't have gone to jail but they did because
02:16:43 the prison industrial complex you know needs more slaves haha yeah fuck yeah uh so yeah she's a little
02:16:50 bit of a cop a little bit of a cop that shit sucks big big cop big time cop no she's awful she's
02:16:57 terrible uh but i mean you know i guess mike pence makes her look good i guess so you know yay yay
02:17:09 biden biden biden biden uh well i know about pence is that he's some kind of like fucking like
02:17:17 idiot like local like news jockey or like like radio host or something and like that was his thing
02:17:23 for a while really that's yeah yeah he was it's funny because like he seems to have like no
02:17:30 personality whatsoever well he just seems like to be in the back yeah behind the scenes doing
02:17:36 whatever he's like the anti-trump you know i can't i can't even picture what his voice sounds like i
02:17:42 don't even know what he sounds like i don't know i don't i don't think i've ever seen him talk i
02:17:47 miss the i miss the kamala debate so i'll maybe i'll maybe i'll go the rest of my life never
02:17:52 knowing what he sounds like that would be nice that'd be pretty good actually oh it's me mike
02:17:57 pence hello this is what i sound like that's it that's what it was uh yeah he ran like a he ran
02:18:04 some kind of radio show for a while i think uh i don't remember i learned i learned this from um
02:18:10 the renegade renegade cut did a video about him oh i love renegade cut that guy that guy's awesome
02:18:16 he's good i have not watched a lot of his recent i went on i went down a renegade cut rabbit hole
02:18:21 for a while and then i i'll do this like i'll watch it all of one guy's thing for a while and
02:18:27 then i'll like be like okay done and then i'll like find something else and then like i will
02:18:32 forget to watch their new stuff uh do that all do this all the time just just hop from channel to
02:18:37 channel binge it all and then i'm like well what next where do i go from here yeah yeah you guys

02:19:03 watching really long speed runs of like final fantasy games uh i was watching uh i still haven't
02:19:10 finished actually a final fantasy 10 speed run is eight hours long i think i got about
02:19:15 two hours to go on that one uh who the hell yeah i like uh informational videos i've been
02:19:24 like going through the recommendations and there's v-source there and i've been like yeah
02:19:29 v-source so just watch loads of v-source videos before i go to bed um i still don't understand
02:19:35 the banach tarq ski park paradox but one of these days i'll watch that video and i'll get it
02:19:41 that's that's all i know uh i mean i've been watching pokemon challenges i mentioned him
02:19:48 already but i've been watching his videos lately uh oh my man weird explorer weird explorer is a
02:19:55 is a hidden gem about a guy who uh just wants to try every fruit in the world uh he just eats
02:20:05 weird fruits i see it's really cool i see oh a year ago he uploaded this one oh he's eating the
02:20:12 gack fruit um that's here look you want you want to see what the gack fruit looks like uh look like
02:20:19 the nickelodeon on the inside hopefully there it is oh yeah nice there's my man uh thumbnail
02:20:30 what is that face he's making doesn't look very excited yeah he looked very sad
02:20:36 he he posted a video not too long ago where he he he he wanted to try the cloudberry um but he
02:20:43 didn't just like get one he like went on like a trip to um i scanned an avia and like went like
02:20:50 foraging in the woods to like find one find one like ripe off the the bush or whatever uh it was
02:20:57 great yeah uh and you know what he said it tasted pretty good so that was a good video who am i to
02:21:06 disagree are all of his videos like he just puts in his mouth he says that's pretty good most of his
02:21:11 videos are just him kind of he'll just kind of hold the fruit and like shake it talk about like
02:21:18 where where it comes from talk about like you know how it's generally eaten by whoever eats it or if
02:21:24 it's eaten anywhere yeah and then he'll like yeah he'll just cut into it and eat it and like be like
02:21:29 taste uh bad um taste like a mud uh taste like a shit uh subscribe there is a way to do that but
02:21:38 that's that's the gist i've been watching this guy named brutal moose i think his name is brutal
02:21:45 moose he i am familiar with that name yeah he he uh does the thing called brutal foods and he just
02:21:52 like eats uh tv dinners and talks about how disgusting they are and funny sound effects
02:22:00 amazing i are they that bad i don't know i'm looking at some of these thumbnails and like
02:22:08 that doesn't look hungry man dinner doesn't look too bad you know i mean that's so i think i could
02:22:13 stomach it i guess yeah there's lots of salt in those things you should not eat them yeah
02:22:19 especially if you're especially if you're born in the 80s you know because you're old
02:22:26 it's true no you know i'm really wrong i'm really thinking about like what youtube stuff i get
02:22:34 excited for nowadays and i don't think there's anything left really that's what i'm saying like
02:22:39 i don't have anything every time i used to be so excited for like jon tron for example um or you
02:22:46 know i had a list of like i love these creatives and now i'm just like uh jon tron didn't he do
02:22:52 the right rain grip too didn't he like trans people i think he got led down led down the wrong path
02:23:01 i feel like he said he said some pretty fucked up shit on a stream with destiny and he has never
02:23:07 apologized or taken it back uh so it's a little like he quote unquote he clarified it but like
02:23:14 he didn't understand did not do like anything for me it didn't really like it's clear that he
02:23:22 still hasn't looked into the things that people are calling him out about and you just say guys
02:23:27 i'm not a white nationalist i'm i'm not that's basically what it was that that's pretty much
02:23:32 all he said but he didn't explain like he didn't explain like how he changed his mind or anything
02:23:37 or like how he actually in hindsight i don't agree with the things that i said no it was terrible
02:23:42 it was a terrible apology yeah so like public apologies are always so terrible you know when
02:23:47 people apologize to public it's just so it's cringy every single time i i hate them yeah yeah i mean
02:23:55 it wasn't the like the stereotype that you might imagine of him like being like with the sad piano
02:24:01 music and him like pretending to cry he like walks in from off camera sits down guys it's time to
02:24:06 be past that side yeah you know who'd had a you know who had a good had a good public apology though
02:24:13 who yeah you know i guess uh my man my man my man pro jared pro jared uh had a great public
02:24:22 apology uh and pro jared did nothing wrong and i i stand oh the yeah yeah that was a pretty crazy
02:24:30 video wait what what did everyone hate his guts for oh man i have a hard time okay with all the
02:24:37 internet drama well this was i mean that was a while ago but there was a lot there was um okay well he
02:24:43 got he he got divorced from his wife and at the same time some people accused him of uh of uh
02:24:53 basically pedophilia and uh he and he he he made it you know he basically like disappeared
02:25:01 and like people were really it made me really mad because people like treated these two things
02:25:06 is like the same like people were angry about him and like they would talk about like oh how he was
02:25:11 like his his ex-wife would like say all these terrible things about him and like oh he was
02:25:14 such a bad husband and stuff and they would say that in the same breath as they're like oh yeah and
02:25:18 he was also a child groomer and it's like those are not those are not even comparable um but then
02:25:24 you know he disappeared from the internet for a while and then he came back with with a big video
02:25:28 when he's like with a big receipt he didn't yeah he didn't he didn't talk about um the divorce at all
02:25:34 in that video but he just said like um yeah so like here's why you know here's why these allegations
02:25:42 are false and like he made a pretty good you know a pretty solid case for it and it was like yeah okay
02:25:47 good I just uh I just really hate his ex-wife uh uh so you know I was glad I was glad that
02:25:57 he made a comeback just uh because you know I think it would be funny if she had a bad time
02:26:05 that's what I think amazing cool these these public personalities on the internet and
02:26:13 all the callouts and accusations it's it's so weird like it's uh yeah you know like I have
02:26:22 a hard time wrapping my head around all this you know like I mean this because cloud is currency so
02:26:29 you know you gotta you gotta jockey you gotta try and maneuver you know you gotta like take down
02:26:35 someone so you can get their cloud you know or whatever if you're if you're the guy who like
02:26:42 owned someone hard enough then uh you know like like uh you can oh yeah you can be you can be the guy
02:26:50 who canceled some other some other big dude you know and that's and that's that's cloud in itself
02:26:59 you know I have zero interest in like calling out or trying to cancel like even people who've
02:27:04 wanted me you know like I you know like earlier we're talking about like how people in my own
02:27:08 community treat me like garbage you know like I I forgive them all you know like I you know I
02:27:14 I'm a very forgiving person you know like I get it you know there's been times
02:27:18 where like someone whispered in my ear like hey that person actually really sucks because of reasons
02:27:23 and I'm like yeah yeah they suck you know and uh you know like it makes me wonder like how often
02:27:32 like do people just get totally reamed that like just don't deserve it you know
02:27:38 yeah I think it's it's quite often but it's it's hard to tell and and getting all of the information
02:27:44 necessary to know is sometimes such an ordeal that I don't even want to get into like I'll just
02:27:50 assume everything everything is wrong and nothing is real because I don't want to have to form an
02:27:56 opinion on whether the ex youtuber did or didn't do the things that they said or have been told
02:28:03 they're doing by this other youtuber it's like everyone's stupid I don't want to I don't like it
02:28:10 yeah like recently there is that uh that transgender woman who like I guess she like hooked up a
02:28:17 controller to or like you know a vibrator or something like that right you know and um
02:28:23 um you know she had the the the vibrator you know like well here the story was is that like
02:28:30 you know that she was masturbating with children on uh let's play you know that was like the info
02:28:36 that I got yeah right you know I'm like what the fuck is this and I looked into it and like
02:28:42 apparently she just like she uh hooked up this controller to a vibrator right and then had the
02:28:48 vibrator like laying on her chest and like basically uh I forget which game it was but uh you know
02:28:55 every time she like bumped into a character the vibrator would vibrate on her chest you know
02:29:01 and then like then she realized um like oh this might be weird and then she like disconnected it
02:29:06 right and then it turned into this huge thing where like you know I got people in my DM saying
02:29:11 it's all like you follow her you gotta unfollow her she's masturbating you know on this video
02:29:18 came and I'm like holy shit and you know and like all it took was 30 seconds of research to like
02:29:25 you know realize that what they were saying was yeah yeah blown out of proportion it just
02:29:30 wasn't true you know she wasn't masturbating you know um it's like it's like the thing with with
02:29:38 progerid was like even though the bigger allegations were false there's still a bit of
02:29:44 iffyness with him like having a weird um like alter ego sexy tumblr so it's not completely clean
02:29:53 but at the same time it's not too bad either it's it's just you know I mean it's not yeah it's it's
02:29:59 expanded into it's not what people were saying ever yeah uh and it's very very very very very
02:30:07 frustrating all your folks here seem very like forgetting and open you know like in my like
02:30:14 online circles it's like fuck all of these people 100% you know it's um god no it's exhausting
02:30:22 living like that yeah I mean and honestly is uh you know like I I have a hard time I mean there
02:30:29 are there are people who I think like fuck them forever about uh but you know but but not people
02:30:37 you've heard secondary information about right no right there's people who are like scoring you
02:30:42 in real life and you're just like you know what I'm done dealing with that person but when it's
02:30:46 like secondhand information from someone online who you're never going to have an actual interaction
02:30:50 with it's like why waste all the time and energy like hating on that person you know you could just
02:30:55 kind of like acknowledge it but like okay that happened and just move on it doesn't have to become
02:31:00 this huge fucking ordeal and it just seems like unhealthy to have that kind of standard anyway
02:31:06 because like I don't know eventually like if we keep like making this purity test
02:31:11 more and more stringent eventually you're not going to pass it anymore and then you've
02:31:15 helped create an environment where everyone's going to turn on you and it's just like I'd
02:31:19 rather like let people have room to learn and grow and get better and like make mistakes
02:31:26 yeah you know and it's another thing that you know the recently someone's in my DM saying you
02:31:31 got on follow this artist they they draw you know child porn I'm like holy shit you know I'm like
02:31:36 you know and this that's that's a big deal you know and then I'm like well you know
02:31:42 I asked the person where it's the evidence for this and like the evidence was literally
02:31:48 a drawing of Birdo or Yoshi from Mario but their butthole was showing you know
02:31:54 oh what that's funny you know and that's child porn
02:32:02 okay it was a youthful Yoshi why because like is Yoshi canonically like young or something I don't
02:32:09 know yeah maybe that's what it was but I'm just like you know and like and that's like a big deal
02:32:15 like because she's only 17 according to the according to the guidebook with uh with a super
02:32:20 from a super nintendo this is fucked up you know and like you had Yoshi in the game he's only 10
02:32:27 minutes old yeah yeah oh shit that's true that's true you know baby and it's it's it's like but
02:32:38 this stuff pops up like constantly you know and like it's like it's gotten to the point where it's
02:32:46 just like I don't know what to believe about people anymore you know it's yeah no I when I see um
02:32:54 yeah I don't think much of it when I see like if I hear that like you know someone you know did
02:33:00 something like I really need to see like evidence I need you know if someone is doing something wrong
02:33:05 I'm not it's not enough to just hear it I I have to see it like that's the only that's the only way
02:33:14 I kind of think that's probably how it should be yeah yeah yeah yeah um I mean I think probably
02:33:20 things would be better uh if everybody uh did that I know I don't know you know they on social
02:33:25 media there's like a lot of kids there's like a lot of there's cloud chasers there's like young
02:33:30 kids who are stupid and there's you know yeah that's like another the kids like they're uh they're
02:33:37 super concerned about zoophilia have you noticed that like you see a bunch of teenagers and they're
02:33:41 all super concerned and like is this a problem or like people fucking animals is that a thing
02:33:46 that's a problem right now in our society they've discovered not safe for work are for the first
02:33:50 time and they're shaking they're literally shaking that's all it is is it just that they if they want
02:33:55 is it just that they want to shame furries and like call them like uh you know perverts or whatever
02:34:01 and like is that what's going on there I have no idea but I feel like it's the thing that
02:34:08 that just keeps cropping up because you know young people come onto the internet all the time
02:34:13 and they discover the internet um for the first time and they learn all these things and then
02:34:18 they get mad about certain things and it's just sort of it's a it's a wave it just comes and goes
02:34:23 I don't know I don't I don't pay too much attention to a lot of the outrage because I know a lot of
02:34:29 it is is very young people coming to terms with some strange things about the internet that
02:34:35 aren't really that big of a problem do you guys see that tweet the other day it was like it blew
02:34:41 up it was like uh liking petite women is rooted in pedophilia though that was a great that was a
02:34:48 another great take from the twitter uh take machine yeah um
02:34:57 I saw a lot of really I saw a lot of really funny responses to it I wish I could remember
02:35:01 them off off the top of my head but whatever it was big big shit show that that is disgusting
02:35:07 and bad you know and like but some of these like accusations are huge like big crimes you know like
02:35:13 like pedophilia is disgusting you know like you don't do that to children you know and like to
02:35:20 just like they're throwing it around like it's confetti you know and uh they gotta be the most
02:35:26 outlandish they gotta have the biggest headline to get the most twitter likes in on twitter it's
02:35:32 all about being extreme like we were saying oh yeah I mean it's a it's a serious accusation and it's a
02:35:38 really easy it's just a really easy way I don't know it's a it's really easy way to just like
02:35:44 spread something bad about something if you just want to destroy them that's like the the simplest
02:35:49 way to do it um you know I don't think we got to talk about it but uh you know like um so I
02:35:56 reshared that shoplifting comic right you know and like yeah I guess some people couldn't handle that
02:36:02 I had the confidence to do that and uh you know they dug up that seven-year-old comic of mine
02:36:07 you know and uh and you know now that I think about it I think the only place they could find
02:36:12 that comic is on kiwi farms so I'm pretty sure kiwi farms person what were you saying what was the
02:36:20 old one what was the old the old comic so like this I it was a comic I made you know oh my god so
02:36:26 like it was like back in 2013 I was like super sjw back then you know um you know because like
02:36:34 you know like I because like you know I transitioned in them you know you know started
02:36:39 transitioning the mid-2000s and you know family and friends treated me like shit I got like
02:36:45 super sick of it then I kind of discovered you know the social justice thing and I you know
02:36:51 you know ran with it hard you know and um you know well because it was super empowering to me like
02:36:57 as a you know trans person that like has been sucked over you know uh and so like you know
02:37:05 my old comics were all about that kind of stuff you know like how how shitty transphobia is and
02:37:10 stuff and uh so this comic that you know that I that one of my friends helped me make right
02:37:18 you know because like especially you know because like all the canceling stuff that was a thing back
02:37:22 then too you know I was super paranoid to like talk about anything that wasn't inside my own exact
02:37:29 experience so like I got my you know this person I'm still friends with to this day I actually
02:37:35 did a social distance hangout with yesterday honestly um you know we uh you know just made
02:37:42 this comic about uh trans guys you know struggling with uh you know machismo culture and like the
02:37:50 pressure you know to be like you know super masculine and kind of shitty you know kind of
02:37:56 like you know and like you know as a trans you know femme like I kind of related to that but like
02:38:02 on the opposite end you know like people tell me I have to like wear you know high heels all the
02:38:06 time and put on makeup every day you know it's like you know but I you know um so like I basically
02:38:13 you know me and my friend we made this comic about like just a trans guy struggling with um
02:38:17 you know and like basically the narrative that uh these kids came up with was that like I hate
02:38:25 trans men because I think that like they're oh embracing toxic masculinity you know and uh but
02:38:32 like that's the thing that's such an easy like I don't know it's just like a lazy like you know
02:38:38 like hey if I look at this thing and I don't engage with it and I don't like think about it
02:38:44 I don't know it's just I can spin this they say I can spin this yeah yeah such a lazy spin
02:38:50 but but you know and that's the thing like I you know but but that's the thing it caught fire
02:38:54 and like thousands and thousands of people saw it right and then like the person got pressure to
02:38:59 apologize and one of the people who shared it also you know apologize and like a dozen people
02:39:04 saw the apology but now like you know I'm still getting dm this like from people being like you
02:39:10 hate you know trans men and like you know or like you know like you know like something uh some of
02:39:17 the replies under a comic of mine recently it's like why do you hate trans men you know and it's
02:39:21 and it's like this thing and it takes on a life of its own and like even no matter how ridiculous
02:39:26 it is it's like you know you get stained with that and it sticks it sticks to you it's and it sucks
02:39:33 I I have to wait hold on one second I gotta I gotta end the craig recording and start a new one
02:39:41 let me do that right now it's okay okay we're good we're good okay um
02:39:47 it I mean it reminds me of like the buck angel thing on contra points right and how everyone
02:39:51 said that like oh it's like she is you know has this like this guy on this kind of who said like
02:39:59 transphobic things and then there was the the the the whole um I don't know there's such a fucking
02:40:05 kerfuffle like every time contra points does anything yeah yeah it's it's it's that that thing
02:40:12 of of the popularity getting people more ready and willing to try and take them down
02:40:21 contra points is huge so it's like oh wouldn't it be great if she fell
02:40:25 from such a great height all of my online social circles hate her guts 100% you know I
02:40:31 I can't understand what I mean can I ask why well I mean the narrative is that she is
02:40:38 quote truce gum and she hates non-binary people uh that's what people say yeah okay and um
02:40:47 you know like I'm gonna say I'm like I do not stand contra points I don't I don't like I'm not I'm
02:40:53 I'm not a huge fan I I mean like I I've seen all of her videos you know like what one of them drying
02:40:58 and stuff they just autoplaying stuff like that you know I like a lot of the stuff that she says that
02:41:05 is good like it is just old news to me and then you know I you know for you know and it's like
02:41:11 for me let's um you know I don't hate her guts you know I think like the worst accusations against
02:41:17 her uh like are aren't true like I don't think she hates non-binary people I'm a non-binary person
02:41:24 I I you know I if all there are non-binary people think she sucks like that's their thing and
02:41:30 they're completely you know they could uh I mean I uh I mean I understand how some of the things she's
02:41:37 I understand why she's rubbed people the wrong way but like I mean I I don't know it's a and I've
02:41:42 seen people say oh yeah she hates non-binary she's a true scum I mean she has said in response to that
02:41:49 like no I'm not like that's not what I think and like has explained what she does believe so like if
02:41:55 you claim that you're basically just saying that like she's just lying and like I don't believe
02:41:59 that she's I don't believe that she's like making these videos and just like pretending to believe
02:42:04 things that she doesn't I really don't yeah that's she's just willing to to entertain her own um like
02:42:12 thoughts of because I watched her beauty video not too long ago and she goes into like um you know
02:42:20 asking the question of like why would I go to such lengths to you know get surgery to change the
02:42:25 shape of my skull and all this stuff and it involved like talking points and and discussions like
02:42:32 like a like a genuine introspective discussion about like things that could be labeled as
02:42:38 true scummy thoughts but like it's it's what she does is to like invite the discussion which is
02:42:45 why she's so popular because she through asking these questions and then discussing them openly
02:42:52 has reached so many more people than she would have otherwise so like her personal beliefs
02:42:59 like just because you're you're you're willing to entertain ideas and talk about them in a video
02:43:04 doesn't mean that you necessarily believe them and she's you know she's explained what our actual
02:43:10 beliefs are so it's like they just they just they're just mad you know it's for me it's like
02:43:19 obviously there's things to critique about her you know but you know and but there's this thing
02:43:26 that the part that people ignore right is that I think that trans women especially there's something
02:43:33 about us that people they just we they they you know and this I'm talking about other trans people
02:43:41 you know like they just jump up our asses big time you know and it's like you know like if
02:43:49 it was anyone else saying the same things you know like sure get the criticism that you deserve but
02:43:56 you know like you know but the way like people talk about like these you know not just contrabot
02:44:03 tons of people like it's like all this bad faith that like you know they're like like I remember
02:44:08 when Chelsea Manning right do you remember when Chelsea Manning went to that like alt right ball
02:44:14 or whatever uh you know maybe she like crashed this like party of full of like right wingers right
02:44:23 and like everyone on my feed was like like fuck her and I'm like oh my god you know she's like
02:44:30 she's a fucking hero what are you talking about you know like yeah you know and
02:44:38 it's like it's cop it's cop behavior it's very much like oh you shouldn't you shouldn't do that
02:44:43 you shouldn't say that you shouldn't uh it's very very uh uh uh just very much like please
02:44:50 please follow my script I guess yeah kind of uh but yeah my about behavior I think you know trans
02:44:59 women are getting held much higher standard than everyone else you know yeah yeah I think uh
02:45:06 let's probably agree with that I see I see that kind of you know and like that's you know and like
02:45:11 I wouldn't be surprised if like someone listened to this and then like you know took it out of
02:45:15 context and they're like you know like oh now Mallory's uh you know I see the term contra points
02:45:20 apologist unironically used you know you know and it's yeah it's just like this is just a person
02:45:30 you know like yeah you know and it's like does she deserve to be as popular as she is I don't know
02:45:38 probably not no you know like yeah like yeah you know she's not seeing anything very new
02:45:45 you know um sure you know like I think I think the reason why she got so popular is because like
02:45:50 her videos look cool and they got the cool music and stuff like that you know what I mean
02:45:56 yeah maybe no for sure for sure it definitely had a part to play although at the very beginning I was
02:46:01 turned off by how extremely feminine it was I was like that's silly but I really got into it afterwards
02:46:09 um but you know it's like but then people get obsessed with like you know with like other
02:46:16 people get to be wrong and then they forget about it right you know but when a trans woman is seen
02:46:20 as wrong it's like you know like people obsess and obsess and obsess you know um I like I used to
02:46:28 belong to this like group filled with trans women on facebook right you know and there is this one
02:46:33 person in there who got you know popular and but this person was an asshole right you know they
02:46:39 treated they treated people unfairly they were smug they were exclusionary you know they pissed off
02:46:46 a lot of people in the group right you know kind of like you know contra points you know by saying
02:46:51 like being a jackass like contra points you know contra points is jackass sometimes you know I think
02:46:56 like you know what I mean and uh yeah I think so and you know it's like
02:47:03 you know other people get to be jackasses and like it's kind of forgiven or forgotten about
02:47:09 you know but like you know this this person in this group you know and like this is like not a huge
02:47:14 clout thing you know they don't make videos or anything you know people to this day are still
02:47:18 obsessed with this person being an ass this trans woman being an asshole like people made
02:47:24 separate facebook groups based around talking shit about this trans woman you know who is like
02:47:30 you know and it's like weird like people just get you know and you see it like the kiwi farms
02:47:36 like all the so many people in there are trans women you know that you know get shit on yeah you
02:47:43 know and uh and we do you know it's like not even um you know it's not just the chuds it's our own
02:47:49 community oftentimes other trans women you know and uh it's you know like the world doesn't like us
02:47:57 very much you know and I think in turn you know like it makes us not like ourselves and each other
02:48:05 and it's a big problem you know um damn yeah it's I I haven't felt that quite as much um
02:48:17 I I don't put on a voice but I am trans myself haha um uh I haven't tried I haven't tried changing
02:48:26 my voice to I haven't really tried presenting yet quite new but um oh you're new well congratulations
02:48:32 on all of that and coming out and stuff hey good for you thank you yeah let's yeah yeah no it wasn't
02:48:41 for the applause I know I mean it's not you think oh you want to like give once a middle you know no
02:48:48 when I first transitioned you know this is like you know I started in the mid-late
02:48:53 2000s when I you know and like it was before the the tipping point right and like oh like I remember
02:49:02 the time magazine trans tipping point from 2013 or 14 no so I mean okay well basically uh the time
02:49:12 magazine came out with an article about like you know the trans tipping point about how like
02:49:16 we're like you know we're visible now basically you know we like in popular culture that was
02:49:21 basically the whole thing you know and so like back then I had no idea how just disliked we were
02:49:31 in general you know and there's like tons of reasons why people dislike us you know like
02:49:36 you know name you know there's it's a whole whole thing you know but I was like naive to all that
02:49:42 right you know um I was just super excited that like I'm like oh my god I get to be myself now
02:49:49 you know and like this is a good thing for me personally and like it's making me a better person
02:49:54 you know and so like it kind of came as a shock to me that like you know all of a sudden
02:50:01 you know like I wasn't given the benefit of the doubt that I used to get you know
02:50:07 like in the workplace my work got critiqued you know I I went from employee of the month
02:50:13 to you know like uh getting breathed down my neck all the time that's really nice though yeah you
02:50:19 know and it's like it's it's so subtle it's hard to talk about you know especially in public
02:50:25 because like a lot of this stuff is subtle right you can't like you can't like point to like one
02:50:30 thing and be like that's it yeah you know it's like people get annoyed with us a lot easier
02:50:35 you know that's like part of it it's like you know it's just subtle and like even like you know
02:50:40 someone was you know someone who uh I saw on twitter just like uh like a month ago like someone was
02:50:45 making a joke right about how trans women are annoying you know and like they were trying to
02:50:50 be ironic making fun of how people hate trans women and then like the whole like thread was like
02:50:55 other trans women be like yeah we're fucking annoying I get why people hate us and it's just
02:50:59 like oh my god unfortunate you know and I mean there's a lot of like there's a lot of insecurity
02:51:11 about it and you I don't know and well I'm I think it's so when it comes to you know like
02:51:20 you know like uh people who are in the public sphere you know um I that that is more easily
02:51:27 annoyed thing gets you know amplified a lot you know and you know so when someone like
02:51:33 country points comes around and says some jackass things it like you know people latch onto it and
02:51:40 they don't let go you know and um yeah you know or like you know it's like you know uh
02:51:47 Mallory hates trans men now and they won't let go you know um and it's it's yeah I don't know I
02:51:55 I haven't yeah I was gonna say that I hadn't experienced a lot of that towards me although
02:52:01 I'm thinking about it I have gotten ever so slightly more like shitty twitter replies
02:52:08 um since coming out but mostly positive and it's I guess I'm I'm thankful that I'm such a small
02:52:16 like internet figure that it doesn't affect me quite as much like if I were to get big I could
02:52:23 I could see it like oh being a bad thing absolutely yeah especially you know like you know just the
02:52:29 stuff that we were talking here today you know it's like you gave projair the benefit of doubt or
02:52:34 I forgot who was doing that earlier but like you know just like giving you know these youtubers the
02:52:39 benefit of the doubt is enough to get like your ass reamed on uh you know twitter you know and um
02:52:47 you know and like what you're you know like when I get some in the benefit of the doubt it's it's
02:52:52 not like I'm not trying to put them on a pedestal or anything I'm just like trying to be a good person
02:52:57 you know and like you're trying to be a human being yeah you know it's because like if you think
02:53:01 about all of this all of the the drama and the things at the end of the day it is people
02:53:08 who have opinions about other people and other people getting extremely frustrated about that
02:53:14 it's strange and unnatural social behavior that doesn't happen in real life like you don't
02:53:21 it's impossible to get mad at someone that you don't really know personally
02:53:26 about what they think about someone else except on the internet where it happens all the time
02:53:32 yeah such a strange like it you can easily not do that ever but yeah you don't fall into things
02:53:40 like that and my thing personally is this like I rather give a piece of garbage you know the
02:53:46 benefit of the doubt and another chance and another chance and another chance than like you know
02:53:52 accidentally like condemning and maybe even like you know exiling and just screwing over a person
02:53:59 who has like is a decent person who has you know good in their heart you know it's like
02:54:07 you know because that's what happens you know like you know I lost a community because I made a
02:54:14 character shoplift you know in my comic and now like still so ridiculous it's like and that that's
02:54:20 the tipping point for some people that's enough you know and like and it's made me afraid to
02:54:27 like engage with like other artists you know like uh you know because it's like oh do you think I'm
02:54:32 a piece of shit or not I have no idea you know um and it sucks because I think you're cool well thank
02:54:41 you but uh you know what I mean but like I'm a person with needs and and desires and flaws and
02:54:47 you know and um you know like I need community you know and uh like it's uh you know especially
02:54:55 during quarantine like so much of our social has been uh constrained to the internet you know and
02:55:02 but like the way we treat each other on the internet is fucking awful you know and I don't
02:55:07 think enough people are talking about it and uh you know like you know like I think it's gonna
02:55:13 take a lot of work to stop it you know because uh you know like we have to change the way that we
02:55:20 think about things you know it's a complicated uh puzzle and and and it's also like something that is
02:55:30 it it would require so much mental and physical energy uh that a single person cannot figure it
02:55:37 out on their own they've got their own life to live and so like the way it gets sorted is
02:55:45 it's kind of like even if you think of how to do it how do you make it happen is another thing
02:55:53 you know you need to dedicate your life to it and it's like I don't want to dedicate my life
02:55:57 to cleaning up the internet I didn't break anything I didn't make this mess yeah you know I just exist
02:56:02 yeah exactly you know and I think you know like I think we touched a lot of on a lot of the things
02:56:10 that are causing you know like that cloud stuff you know the numbers are in our face and everyone
02:56:14 wants more numbers you know or you know they're mad that like oh this other person is popular not me
02:56:23 you know or like they're mad that like you know there's this like disagreement and you know like
02:56:29 you know I have no doubt in my mind if certain people listen to this podcast later like we'll
02:56:34 just like want to cut me off because like I'm I gave Natalie the benefit of the doubt you know
02:56:40 even though I said I'm not even like a fan or anything you know but I gave her the benefit
02:56:44 of the doubt so I'm done you know yeah and I mean I can imagine that even if like they they listen to
02:56:51 that the fact that you're on a podcast where we uh like I personally like Natalie and so like
02:57:00 association like oh how could you be in a podcast with give and take who likes Natalie
02:57:05 they'd always find a way to make it the bad thing that you did yeah doesn't matter how
02:57:11 many times you say you know qualified like I'm just saying I'm just saying no they just want to hate
02:57:17 and the thing is and then but then you go and they turn around it's like no this thing that
02:57:21 we're complaining about does not even exist you know like it's it's so fucking bizarre and uh
02:57:29 you know I I uh and so that's why I'm the Joker now I don't care you know I've I've
02:57:39 I've transitioned to the Joker uh my pronouns are now honk and uh and giggles you know that those
02:57:49 are you know like you know it's you know so I see why like people get cynical about this
02:57:56 and then like they turn around and they're like well fuck all y'all you know like um
02:58:03 you know it's uh yeah it it stinks and I and I and I I want I want something to be done about it
02:58:11 you know like because uh you know we're looking down the barrel of a really shitty future and
02:58:17 we need each other you know especially trans people trans people we you know like you know
02:58:23 because like the larger left they're you know like they're sick of us you know um you know
02:58:30 we need each other you know uh and uh like like saying that you know like like this one person
02:58:39 aids bisexual people uh you know and it's you know and that's another thing too you know I have like
02:58:44 all my content creator friends like they all of them unanimously you know like anyone listening
02:58:50 to this like you know everyone is afraid of you know like this thing happening to them also you
02:58:57 know like having their own community come after them and rip them apart and take away you know what
02:59:03 little like you know like uh you know um you know because like people make you know uh you know
02:59:11 some of their income is based on you know the content they create you know and that could go bye
02:59:17 bye like that you know um if you know you say if you say some jackass stuff and the apology
02:59:23 isn't good enough you know yeah I don't know I feel like to to to worry so much about the
02:59:31 possibility of it happening is it's it's almost part of the problem because if if you know like
02:59:40 you're saying like people stopped associating with you now that you're cancelled if they
02:59:45 didn't stop associating with you and if that wasn't a thing then cancel culture wouldn't feel
02:59:49 like it has any weight anyway and then you would still you know people would stand by things rather
02:59:56 than hype like angry hype which is what it feels like yeah you know sort of snowballs out of control
03:00:03 and people don't really they don't really take the time to like think about what it what it all
03:00:09 spawned from they're just like oh I don't want to get hurt I'm just gonna go with whatever everyone
03:00:14 else is saying yeah yeah exactly you know and that's the thing you know like I don't think I'm
03:00:19 entitled to an audience or anything you know I never wanted to be popular I just wanted to be part
03:00:24 of the fucking group you know what I mean and um like uh you know but this like weird demonization
03:00:33 of individuals in our in our groups that that you know barely did anything wrong or was just
03:00:41 being kind of a jackass you know um it's it sucks and I don't like it especially you know
03:00:48 because it keeps happening to me over and over again you know right uh well I mean we live in
03:00:57 hell so you know I you know and part of I invite some of it too because like I said you know I'm
03:01:05 way too genuine and vulnerable on the internet which I probably shouldn't do but I can't help it
03:01:12 because like I you know I had a lot of bad things happen to me in my life and I just you know I'm like
03:01:20 you know I just don't care anymore and I just like I'm sick of like feeling ashamed of like
03:01:26 you know my background and stuff so I have to talk about it yeah but you know probably
03:01:33 pales in comparison to when we all got called ugly on Twitter today uh so
03:01:39 oh ugly did you guys did you guys see the the the tweet that I made or it was a YouTube comment
03:01:45 what on on the on the Jennifer Diane writes lecture someone left a comment that said
03:01:50 nearly everyone in that room is grotesque and not lucky with the opposite sex
03:01:55 yet people take them seriously internet is very strange
03:01:58 wow okay
03:02:06 grotesque all right no I'm none of you are grotesque
03:02:12 and not lucky with the opposite sex so there you go two things you really shouldn't be
03:02:19 if you uh if you know if you can help it I I think okay I'm sorry I don't want to cut off but I do
03:02:27 I think we gotta kind of wrap it up yeah it's been a while because I have to I have to go and

03:13:56 backstory down everyone is just fucking everyone's dropping dead margaret samurai we need some
03:14:05 beautiful colorful characters who will be next who who will rise to take the throne next next
03:14:14 voicemail cross y'all we're talking about circumcision three two one go okay the definition of mutilation
03:14:22 is cutting off or causing injury to a body part of a person so that the part of the body is
03:14:26 permanently damaged detached or disfigured so circumcision does fit the definition of mutilation
03:14:31 but so does getting your ears pierced also just going to add that considering the extremely negative
03:14:35 connotation that the word mutilate has it probably wouldn't fill you with confidence to hear people
03:14:39 use that word when talking about your genitals it is permanent disfigurement but it doesn't really
03:14:43 have any noteworthy downsides and the few cons that it does have are barely worth mentioning true
03:14:47 foreskin does function as a natural lubricant but it doesn't really make a huge difference and while
03:14:51 lube is a product that you have to pay for it does exist and even if you have foreskin you'd be an
03:14:56 idiot not to use it the foreskin also has a lot of nerve endings which assumedly makes sex more
03:15:00 pleasurable but again it doesn't seem to make a huge difference and we can't ignore the sizable
03:15:04 chunk of biological males who suffer from premature ejaculation which if the whole nerve
03:15:08 ending thing is true circumcision would slightly reduce the effects of also ben talked about
03:15:12 circumcision slightly reducing the rates of stds and it being cleaner overall which is technically
03:15:17 true but the reason that's the case is because if you don't wash an uncut versus a cut penis
03:15:21 the uncut penis will get dirtier just by virtue of having surface area that the shower water
03:15:26 isn't touching a properly washed uncut penis is just as clean as a properly washed cut penis
03:15:30 it's just that some people are retarded and don't wash their dick and the effects of that are more
03:15:34 prevalent in uncircumcised penises conclusion all of the pros and cons of circumcision are negligible
03:15:39 it literally is less impactful on a baby's life than getting their ears pierced if a couple wants
03:15:44 to circumcise their kid that's fine if not that's just as fine it doesn't matter who gives a fuck
03:15:49 um i feel like that's true i feel like that's fair i just i just there's the there's um
03:16:04 like that's all like medical and and like pros and cons like to have or to have not
03:16:12 an uncut or cut penis um but i would still have the extra argument of
03:16:19 fuck you mom and dad you don't get to do anything to me yeah i mean i you know i agree and honestly
03:16:27 like if i had a kid i probably wouldn't circumcise him because like yeah why is it up to me
03:16:31 yeah so true truth true next up we were right three two one go
03:17:01 everyone's gonna acknowledge that we're right in a few years once they bring gilgamesh back to life
03:17:06 and insurrect him as god of the new world order all right uh screencap this post
03:17:16 i don't know what that is in reference to is that is that supposed to be that they
03:17:19 was a reference to gilgamesh in hillary's emails uh quick google uh uh uh so cool so cool alex
03:17:30 jones calling into the show you know gilgamesh uh well like gilgamesh there is nephilim slash
03:17:39 gilgamesh in hillary's emails uh what the fuck um okay there's a link on reddit but like it doesn't

03:18:47 voicemails smiley face three two one go hey there pcb this is my review of the voicemails from the
03:18:53 center perspective it's a cool and vault way to interact with some of my favorite per social
03:18:58 personalities it gets me playing good recording my own voice and editing and audacity which is great
03:19:04 a bad part is i can't fucking read so i need post production and voice meter and audio channels are
03:19:09 a nightmare having voice meter installed made me feel like i might as well send a voicemail every
03:19:13 week because of some cost lse of keeping it installed so i'm sent some really shitty voicemails in
03:19:19 uncreative states of mind it feels great to hear my own voice in the show and to make you guys laugh
03:19:25 and it stings when my emails are so bad they're literally getting skipped through or cut two things
03:19:30 for are for certain it is not a place for meaningful or nuanced discussion because of the one-sided
03:19:36 nature of it two parasocialism is a hell of a drug but it is not a viable replacement for meaningful
03:19:42 social interaction with actual friends or loved ones overall score 709 pretty good
03:19:48 bazinga that sounds about right
03:19:53 okay well i'm glad you like the voicemail section friend uh uh yeah uh yes friend

03:20:22 go to patreon.com slash the procrastinators yeah and sign up and something friendship under capitalism

03:21:47 fucking put i'll fucking tweet it well uh next up some fucker takes issue with ben saying three
03:21:55 three two one go ben are you found because i found someone else so perfectly balanced between
03:22:00 base and cranes every time you do say something base you have to follow up with some dumb shit too
03:22:04 usual times in the last episode but the left half are language swap but you've been saying
03:22:07 say things in the most authority way possible like previously gone biologically six you just
03:22:10 say it doesn't exist you can't say i'll call reframing my idea of biologically six it's no
03:22:15 a six could possibly a more broader spectrum or something but instead you phrase it in the
03:22:19 worst way possible and don't follow up you constantly do this and when i think you finally
03:22:22 get your political shit together you go down a new avatar system dumb shit about the circumcision
03:22:27 god damn it ben you're supposed to be the smart one i i gotta i had a little trouble i have a
03:22:34 hey look i gotta review your voice it's bad i can't fucking follow you uh um well he was just saying
03:22:41 you say something based and then you say you follow with something cringe and how dare you
03:22:47 no if i ever say anything cringe that's i'm being sarcastic that's that's it yeah everything
03:22:55 do you think you agree with i'm serious about and everything you don't i'm not it's really easy
03:23:01 that seems very very simple very simple jay fray uh narrow's eyes image
03:23:11 uh whatever some whatever sometimes i get a little facetious and that's
03:23:16 base sometimes you're stupid no i'm i'm many things but i'm not that i don't worry
03:23:23 somefucker i am the smart one i i promise
03:23:29 all right that's it that's it we made it we made it to the end oh three and a half hours
