00:00:00 But something happened on the way to the 20th century.
00:00:03 The profound, the inspiring, and the beautiful
00:00:06 were replaced by the new, the different, and the ugly.
00:00:10 Today, the silly, the pointless, and the purely offensive
00:00:14 are held up as the best of modern art.
00:00:17 It is they who champion graffiti and call it genius,
00:00:20 promote the scatological and call it meaningful.
00:00:24 It is they who, in reality, are the naked emperors of art,
00:00:28 for who else would spend ten million dollars on a rock
00:00:32 than think it is art?
00:00:34 Hello everyone, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:41 I am the best guy ever.
00:00:43 Uh, I am French.
00:00:45 Uh, today we're joined by, uh, Lethal Aurora Mage.
00:00:48 I'm pushed again, but this time I'm the best.
00:00:50 First to the worst.
00:00:51 No, that's-
00:00:52 Oh wait, I said that last time.
00:00:53 Yes.
00:00:53 Oh, well, okay, debunked.
00:00:55 Uh, The Davoo is here.
00:00:57 This podcast emanates rich textures of aura, of satisfaction of the authority.
00:01:04 Ah.
00:01:05 Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
00:01:06 All right, my name is Chris.
00:01:08 Tom Oliver.
00:01:09 Criticism.
00:01:10 Tom.
00:01:10 Oliver.
00:01:11 I just got flashbacks to my art history courses,
00:01:14 and I wanted to vomit all over my excessive microphone.
00:01:17 Disgusting.
00:01:18 Disgusting.
00:01:18 You would have made art.
00:01:20 Yeah, clearly.
00:01:20 Oh, it would look like a- like a Pollock.
00:01:22 Uh, Ben Sates.
00:01:23 I'm I'm back with a vengeance
00:01:28 Indeed I missed one episode and I wanted and it ruined my whole life
00:01:32 My streak is broken
00:01:35 And muchy topics by committee rhymes with shitty
00:01:44 As you as you might be able to tell let's get right down to it our topic for today is
00:01:50 Monsters to everybody
00:01:53 It's the big one. It's the big one that no that was a joke that was art in itself postmodern art
00:01:59 It was meant to highlight how ignorant and stupid you the masses are for loving that so much
00:02:04 It's it's postmodernism modern art, but mostly postmodern art. That's what it is and to get down to the heart of the matter
00:02:12 What do you got for us?
00:02:15 Urban dictionary before we read from the Urban Dictionary. I'd like to read from Urban Dictionary occult edition
00:02:24 At at forum dot become a living God calm
00:02:29 Slash Urban Dictionary dash occult dash edition slash three four oh nine six
00:02:35 However, I cannot because there are only two entries one is for Yahweh and the other is for God
00:02:47 Okay, sure. Let's see what we got as our backup here. Okay Urban Dictionary
00:02:52 Postmodernism a term that you keep on hearing about in college and have to look up on Wikipedia
00:02:58 Basically says fuck it to the search for any intellectual conclusions. Oh my god. Yeah, more complete definition than I thought
00:03:04 I that's actually not terrible. That makes that's so that's the worst thing. I've ever had read to me. Well, all right
00:03:10 That was okay. That was definition to here's the top definition
00:03:13 Postmodernism is the ultimate lubricant
00:03:16 Invented by social sciences in order to fuck every concept and structure that humans ever came up with at the same time
00:03:24 It is used as a means for social sciences to penetrate one another
00:03:32 What dislike modern or what kind of person you have to be you have to be some sort of conservative God or or uncocked
00:03:39 Well, we I think it extends beyond just hard. It's like a whole
00:03:45 Mindset and philosophy that article that article sounds like it was written by maybe like an ex-professor
00:03:52 But who had like a drug problem or something and completely fried
00:03:58 But he's like he's like completely he's like completely burned out after he lost his tenure and he's like a shell of his former self
00:04:04 And he can barely string a sense together. He's definitely never lifted a pencil in their life
00:04:09 Definitely watched a lot of Jordan Peterson. That's that sounds like the guy that I think I think you're right
00:04:14 Listen, okay, but it behooves us because postmodernism and postmodern art exists as a response to modern arts saying like fuck that shit
00:04:22 Dude doesn't even it's not even real. So let me just read the definition of modern art as well
00:04:26 All right, Urban dictionary modern art a synonym
00:04:29 for bullshit
00:04:34 All right, it's actually nothing useful for modern art and urban dictionaries
00:04:37 Let me actually just read like the first sentence on the Wikipedia page. That's actually much much more helpful
00:04:42 So modern art includes artistic work produced during the period extended from blah blah blah the six that 1860s the 70s
00:04:48 1970s and denotes the style and philosophy of the art produced from that era
00:04:52 The term is usually associated with art in which the traditions of the past have been thrown aside in the spirit of
00:04:59 experimentation and it shows like some van Gogh starry night type stuff, which is very right
00:05:05 So part of what I intended to talk about is those scribble paintings like we were referencing Jackson Pollock if you
00:05:13 Don't know what we're talking about Google image search that and also. Oh, what's his name?
00:05:19 Yeah, oh, yeah, also the painter guy who paints just like painterly squares of various colors
00:05:25 Who's name always escapes me just search like wasn't in the velvet underground. What's his name?
00:05:30 Not that are you talking about Andy Warhol?
00:05:33 No, no, are you talking about that painting that's like it's like white and it has a bunch of black lines forming squares
00:05:39 And some of the squares are like red and summer. That's what that's what I did on my best appearance in the drawcast
00:05:44 Yeah, I drew modern art. Yeah, yeah, yeah
00:05:46 That guy so that's kind of the heart of what we're gonna talk about and the reaction to it
00:05:51 Now I'm just gonna like come right out with what I think is the crux of the problem
00:05:56 Which is the criticism and analysis of modern art remaining so
00:06:02 rigid traditionalist and
00:06:04 Classical see it's the reason why people often don't take it seriously when a professor comes up and tells you about how such
00:06:11 And such painting subverts the idea of
00:06:15 Art and subverts the idea of the establishment and authority
00:06:18 The reason why people don't take that seriously is it's coming from a professor a guy who went to college has tenure works in
00:06:25 The system and talks like the system and this is where modern art breaks down for me is when that because like I
00:06:32 Was like in a waiting room recently that had a bunch of modern art books
00:06:35 And I would always pick them up and think the images look cool
00:06:38 And then I want to read some analysis of it
00:06:40 So I go over to the paragraphs and I started reading and this is where my eyes start rolling like a fucking tumble dryer
00:06:47 Because it's trying to describe
00:06:50 Like post-modern art it's trying to describe subversiveness. It's trying to describe
00:06:55 Like like this escape from the traditionalist structures by very traditionally
00:07:00 Explaining it in a very literary way and it doesn't work when you try to employ this sort of
00:07:06 Tangible literary analysis to non tangible inspired art you end up with a bunch of vague sentences
00:07:13 Like what triggered Tom at the beginning of me introducing myself where they try to be like
00:07:17 Oh, it has this texture that implies this feeling of this idea, right?
00:07:22 Like we're it's like you're trying to analyze modern art the same way we analyze classical art where a lot of paintings were of like
00:07:29 Actual things and and paintings were inspired by Bible or other ideologies very explicitly
00:07:34 So so you could actually describe what the paintings actually are very like factually and
00:07:40 Then we get all these paintings that aren't supposed to mean anything technically and yet the analysts and the critics think they're still supposed to
00:07:47 Describe them in these tangible words and it just becomes really stupid and misses the point and makes the average consumer
00:07:53 Miss the point of the whole goddamn movement. I
00:07:56 Got one response to all that
00:07:59 Davoo is where are the fucking memes? Where are they where there wasn't well any means in there
00:08:06 I was looking for some means. I was browsing the the become a living god.com forums as I often do
00:08:13 So
00:08:15 So I'm searching for modern art and I can't find any topics about modern art
00:08:20 So I brought in my search to just art and unfortunately poor results the best thing I could find is this top is this
00:08:27 Thread on the topic of is it possible to learn martial arts from a demon?
00:08:32 The journey the jury
00:08:34 The jury's out on it. So I'm afraid that the become a living god.com has failed for the first time in history
00:08:43 Well, that sucks wait wait actually I have something to say that's relevant also
00:08:48 There is a great good. There is a great video. It is by the art assignment
00:08:54 You guys have ever seen the art assignment
00:08:56 Yeah, no, I have not okay. It's a YouTube series. It's like I think it I think it might be John Green's wife
00:09:03 Or something or someone that John Green knows I think it might be by PBS digital studios
00:09:08 Yeah, but it's it's the video called I could do that. Yeah. Yeah, I could do that. That's the right, okay
00:09:13 That's right. Okay. I haven't I haven't I haven't watched don't co-op my topic
00:09:17 I haven't watched it for a while
00:09:19 But it's about she's talking about how people say that like, you know
00:09:24 You look at a Jackson Pollock or a fucking drawing of squares or a toilet in a museum and you're like
00:09:29 I could do that anyone could do that and
00:09:31 You know the answer is like well sure you could but you didn't like and like it doesn't matter
00:09:37 Like whether you could replicate it. I said this just the other day and like a completely different kind
00:09:42 We were talking about business and entrepreneurs and I guess it's the same for art
00:09:44 It doesn't fucking matter if you could replicate the exact product that someone has made
00:09:50 Which you probably couldn't if you think so but even if you could it doesn't matter
00:09:54 Because the point is that you didn't and the point of this art was that it was made in this context and the context
00:10:00 Is what makes art meaningful even if you did it perfectly and you did in fact just recreate it
00:10:05 Well, then that's good. How does that make the art not good?
00:10:08 The artist does not claim that he is a god for making this piece of art
00:10:12 He wants to communicate an idea or yeah, right and you would just like something similar like like take for example like
00:10:19 Photography like photography is generally considered an art, right?
00:10:23 and at least you know, I guess it depends but like I
00:10:26 Mean for example, like I just watched Digi's new video on Fooley Cooley a little while ago and that was fine
00:10:33 But like there like there's a moment in there where Mamimi of course is this photographer and just at the at the last episode
00:10:39 There's a there's a moment where like now to in like all these crazy events that have happened now
00:10:44 It's does his iconic standing on the rubble holding Haruko's base. Oh, great takes the picture from behind great. He does it again
00:10:52 He does what no, no, this isn't the new Fooley Cooley. This is the he's talking about the original okay
00:10:56 I haven't seen the new. Yeah. No, he just does. I was saying that I just did it again
00:11:00 No, no, this is about the original even though the new ones are out which I should we should watch those at some point
00:11:04 Oh, yeah, but anyway, I mean just I guess I guess I guess I guess I have no choice. Yeah. Why not? Why not?
00:11:10 Yeah, okay
00:11:12 The point I was getting at was like, okay
00:11:14 So so Mamimi takes that picture and like no Mamimi did not like craft the entire situation to like
00:11:20 Generate all the artistry that's in that picture of like this ruined city of like a boy standing
00:11:25 Hopefully on this hill looking at his lost love and holding her base and what not remembering her
00:11:28 But like she did capture that moment in her art. Okay. Yeah. Yeah
00:11:33 The like the important thing there is that is that it was the image is curated, right?
00:11:38 Like the image is like what to what to include in the like Mamimi probably took like a thousand pictures
00:11:44 And she chose to show this one. Yeah, cuz it's the best most like that people when people talk about writing like writing is the same
00:11:52 Like like the act of writing
00:11:54 I think I think this might be a mr. B tongue quote
00:11:56 But he's not the only one who said it's like it's like the act of writing is the act of like creative exclusion
00:12:01 Yeah, selective exclusion to separate signal from noise
00:12:04 You have yeah separate signal from noise because you have a character and you have you know in your mind
00:12:09 If you know if you're most if most authors probably have like if not a full idea
00:12:14 But at least some idea of this character is like entire life story, right?
00:12:18 And this character has theoretically lived an entire life full of shit that could be remarked upon
00:12:22 But you as the author you are like selecting like where do I begin the story there by cutting off everything beforehand?
00:12:29 You know, what do I show or what do I describe? What do I choose not to describe?
00:12:33 And that's what you build your story out of and like photography is the same
00:12:38 You're you're you might yeah, you might not have created it
00:12:41 But you are still doing this the selective exclusion of like I won't take pictures of these things
00:12:46 I will take pictures of this because like my aesthetic sense tells me that this is a well-composed image and it and you know
00:12:51 It means what such-and-such part of it. I think
00:12:56 behind this mindset is
00:12:57 Like human jealousy in a way because when people say oh, I could have done that and you know
00:13:03 I would have been successful. I would have earned the money like I'm not saying like
00:13:08 People are bad for being jealous. It's natural people are just naturally jealous of things like they even did like a test
00:13:14 I think with kids like
00:13:17 Hold on it's not very relevant. It's a long story
00:13:19 Basically people prefer to
00:13:22 Rather than have someone else have more things to that both of them not have at all like, you know
00:13:28 Yeah, that's a thing. That's a thing. Yeah, so it's people are very sensitive to inequality, you know
00:13:34 Justified or not it makes them make some yeah, and like because this idea existed like oh
00:13:39 I had I possess the skill level that this person does but they're earning like they're banking off of it
00:13:46 The seal a lot more than I could ever, you know
00:13:49 I have I never thought about doing well and this it feels like
00:13:53 Like injustice in a way. Yeah, and you know, I think that's yeah, that's definitely a thing
00:13:58 It's like reputation is where the value in art comes from which is another video by the art assignment
00:14:04 They bring up that like yeah
00:14:05 Yeah, the the reputation of specific artists right is what actually drives the prices
00:14:10 But here's the thing that is also the case in other mediums such as live performance music
00:14:15 It costs like six hundred dollars for a ticket to the Rolling Stones or Paul McCartney or other such baby boomer era
00:14:23 Fucking bands that have been around for 40 years because their baby boomer fucking fan base is sitting on tens of thousands of savings
00:14:30 They need to spend in a couple of years before the diagnosis start rolling in
00:14:35 The dreaded diagnosis right
00:14:38 Like they're just able to pump themselves full of fucking money and just pump all that money out of their fans because everyone
00:14:44 I mean, I have to go see the Rolling Stones right you have to so and it's not like some other band where the tickets are say 60 bucks
00:14:51 Let's not like the Rolling Stones in anybody's opinion could have like core progression and lyrical depth that is 10 times greater
00:14:58 It has to do with reputation
00:15:00 Okay, okay, so yeah, it has to do with reputation and
00:15:03 Alright, so I guess someone who doesn't agree with modern art or whatever as like a concept would probably not agree with this statement either
00:15:10 But to me this is like core and I think and I
00:15:14 To me this is obvious, but you know, whatever and that is that like skill like it's it's sad to say
00:15:19 But skill really doesn't matter like in terms of like what art is meaningful and like what people respond to yeah
00:15:26 I mean, it's not that it doesn't matter because you have you need skill
00:15:30 Sometimes you need skill to execute an idea but not always and if you execute something that means something to people and affects people
00:15:36 Then it doesn't matter how quote-unquote skilled you are to two artists can be equally quote-unquote skilled
00:15:41 And it makes no difference if one of them use that skill to make something that people responded to and the other one didn't the reason
00:15:48 Why skill matters is because skill can help better
00:15:51 You know a communicate to the audience what the idea is so it doesn't really matter
00:15:57 How good your skill is as long as you can communicate the same ideas or statement within your art
00:16:02 Yeah, and the skills will just help you do that
00:16:04 So if you want to say, you know, like communicate the idea well aren't humans beautiful isn't the human form beautiful
00:16:12 So much should be good to have a lot of skills specifically the male
00:16:15 Yes, I quickly want to say I just quickly it's like the state as the saying like
00:16:21 Don't work hard work smart. Yeah. Yeah, it also applies to art
00:16:26 My three case studies for what Ben was talking about about it's more about what you're expressing than your skill, right?
00:16:32 First of all, there's fucking
00:16:35 M. Night Shyamalan, right who happened to make his first movie played at his strengths, right?
00:16:40 It's a movie where it seemed like his limited filmography
00:16:43 Which one is that the sixth sense like that that's where it seemed like it seemed like it was a stylistic choice to make the camera
00:16:50 So fucking slow
00:16:51 Which it was but then come last airbender it turns out Shyamalan is just bad at shot composition and moving a camera, right?
00:16:58 Other good example is George Lucas who like happened to have this
00:17:03 He has a great creative core that just has to be
00:17:06 Roped in to but by producers. So once he was allowed to do whatever he want that didn't work, right?
00:17:12 So he has good ideas. He had something really great to express. He just isn't very skilled
00:17:17 So my counter example is zoom someone who cannot fucking draw but
00:17:23 Can aesthetic more than not familiar with zoom. He makes the Toho games, right? Yeah
00:17:31 Like lots of video games espouse the idea that sheer graphical horsepower is how you make a game look good
00:17:37 Where is in other games that are all about art design say no good art is good
00:17:40 And then Toho basically says good art isn't good aesthetic is good
00:17:45 So he's someone who plays to his strengths brilliantly like he let's
00:17:49 I don't fucking are you sure that it's more that people I mean
00:17:54 Who would argue that it's like it's good that the art of zoom of being bad is like better
00:17:59 It's not good necessarily the point is that he he leverages what skills he does have to his favor to great effect
00:18:07 I don't need to do is communicate the idea those skill
00:18:10 Yeah, yeah those skills are not in the artwork itself
00:18:13 But like the art that he does make
00:18:15 Communicates these ideas that are built right through like the the gameplay and the dialogue and the music and whatever else has has for
00:18:22 Instance zoom is trying to communicate that
00:18:25 Or at least I assume I've not played me no to home games
00:18:27 But the art I've seen is cute girls are cute and he's not having a lot of you know artistic skill
00:18:33 But he can't communicate that with his limited skill now could he now couldn't ask so now could he do this better with even greater skill?
00:18:41 Of course he could make a really cute girl in actuality and you would be more convinced of that
00:18:45 But it doesn't mean that just because he does not have the skill
00:18:47 He is not communicated the idea that you girls are cute. I was gonna say isn't toho just like a lot of wifes
00:18:59 The whole point of toho is that if you've it has anyone played it
00:19:02 I have played I have played like one or two toho's
00:19:06 Okay, I've been playing toho. It's just that you go through like you play as like a rainbow or a Marissa
00:19:12 Whatever it is you play is just like a character with very little English damn it
00:19:16 Okay, whatever you're just like some girl with little personality
00:19:20 But you're like have a kind of cute design and you just encounter girls that say very little
00:19:25 But they say enough to get a hint towards their personality and my theory is this is given
00:19:29 I this is I know everyone believes I think it's that just like having so little presented about the characters
00:19:35 I mean just a couple hints about the personality and then you fight them in a cool boss fight
00:19:39 And they have a cute design that gave everyone such a blank check to fill in as much as they wanted for like
00:19:45 Oh, that this is why that character is Moe lol
00:19:47 She's such a one of my favorite youtubers back in the day Digibroni MLP compared the toho fandom to the fandom of the pony
00:19:55 MLP background characters at least circa seasons one two and three yeah four seasons five
00:20:01 But but but okay, okay, it's not enough. It's not enough to just give a blank check cuz like
00:20:07 Nothing like saying nothing would be giving a blank. Well, they give you enough. Yeah
00:20:11 So like there's definitely there's something here that makes people want to like fill the back well like here's a thing
00:20:17 Here's there's a character. There's a character whose name I forget. I'm gonna see if I can find it
00:20:22 It's it's one of the toho girls and the only thing I know about this toho girl
00:20:26 Is that she?
00:20:27 Canonically is is actually tiny like the size of a mouse she wears a sake cup as a big ol hat
00:20:33 And she fights with a needle that is some like legendary needle sword of like this diminutive race
00:20:38 Is she is she hollow night?
00:20:41 She I mean it sent she was hollow night before hollow night was cool. I forget her name someone please it's like haku-jaku
00:20:47 Her name is actually hold hold on
00:20:51 I'm fucking googly to see if I can find it. Oh, it is. Okay, Sukuna
00:20:55 Shin myo Mario Sukuna Shin yo Mario. That's her name and she is adorable
00:21:00 I'm like a fucking picture of her look at her so it's just and my point is just by her design being cute and these basic facts
00:21:07 About her being a cutie and being diminutive and from this weird. She's like a princess or something look at her
00:21:13 Like this was enough to make me like this is not my favorite toho character just because of these basic facts
00:21:18 She's she's cool. That's and I think that's what's happened. I think that's what happened like everybody
00:21:22 Why is she also the games are fun? Why is there a hammer? Why is there a hammer sized for a mouse? Ben?
00:21:27 Do you remember Secret of Mana?
00:21:30 Yeah, remember that item you could get the flammie drum the flammie drum, right? That's right
00:21:36 That's right. Yeah, or no, there's like a mini mallet or something that turns you big or small
00:21:40 Yeah, there's like a there's a Japanese folklore thing. It's like a hammer that resizes you and I think that's what that is
00:21:46 That is a fucking
00:21:48 funny thing
00:21:50 Folklore
00:21:52 Luigi games too, right with the hammer up to squish fucking it is definitely a thing that I have seen in other games
00:21:58 But I specifically I remember it from Secret of Mana, right? Okay. Well, so guys, this is okay
00:22:04 I think we've made our point that like art does not require
00:22:08 Like the artist to be the most skilled person so to that end. Let's get back to like
00:22:12 I mean, wait, wait, wait case and point fucking
00:22:15 Tails gets trolled. Well, yeah, don't watch my fucking lecture idiots. Well, I just want to plug his legs
00:22:21 He's the he's the least he's the least talented. Well, that's not true, but you know, he's clearly laserbot. Please come on our show
00:22:29 He's not the least talented, but you know, he's like there are better artists out there
00:22:32 But yet the story that he makes is compelling as fuck and it doesn't matter
00:22:36 Is it if it were drawn better quote unquote better? Would it be a better comic? No, so there you go
00:22:41 Well, and in fact the low quality of it enhances the majority of it and the comedy and I mean you get to see him improve
00:22:48 Which is always interesting like I mean for me seeing an artist improve over the course of their long-form work is like
00:22:53 Oh, it's fucking me. Mm-hmm. Okay, so I have a question
00:22:56 I've been listening for the last 25 minutes and and I just my my question is I rage building
00:23:02 No, no, no
00:23:04 Because my problem is that like I just as much as I want to say that like modern art is gay
00:23:09 I just need it like that's just the end of the story. I just hate it. I just hate it
00:23:14 Because I and it I'm glad we have a contrarian. I'm glad we have someone with the opposite of modern art
00:23:19 Oh post-modern art, which are we talking about? I'm gonna say I'm not gonna be so obtuse as to blanket statement in a tire
00:23:26 Genre it's just like that kind of art the kind of art we're talking about I understand it gets trolled
00:23:31 I know not tails get trolled but like like in a gallery setting and stuff. I
00:23:35 Okay, I just I don't find it appealing to me personally and I you know as much as I'd like to make a more intellectual case
00:23:41 I really don't have one but my question is is that for the last 25 minutes
00:23:46 We have you've all come to the conclusion that you skill doesn't really matter at the end of the day
00:23:52 And it's just you know people like what they like or whatever
00:23:55 So how do we reconcile that fact with the fact that we shit on awful youtubers?
00:24:00 I got it. I know how Tom. I know how Tom because we distinguish between
00:24:05 Art that is itself valuable and meaningful and it does not matter how that art came into existence
00:24:09 Whereas when we're viewing the artist when we're talking about who the artist is it does matter how they achieve the thing
00:24:15 They're trying to make which is why even though the room for example is what?
00:24:18 Yeah, I was just thinking of all time
00:24:19 I would never say that I think that Tommy Wiseau is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time
00:24:24 I think that's the important distinction here the artist separate, okay, but the problem is when we're talking about
00:24:30 Modern and post-modern art the people and the culture they do say that yes
00:24:35 Jackson Pollock is one of the greatest artists of all time. Hi. Well, he has made a lot of those it is repeatable
00:24:41 What he's done? Well, here's okay
00:24:43 I'd like to like make it clear exactly where I'm coming from on this and this it comes from something
00:24:48 I believe it was a year and a half ago when uh
00:24:50 We in the PCP chat talked about that art assignment video called I can do that because we were watching it because we had just come off
00:24:56 the coals of watching this Paul Joseph Anderson video where he's just like
00:25:00 Look at all these stupid paintings. This one's just a square. This one is just a bunch of scribbles
00:25:05 It's so stupid these people shouldn't be so famous and we're kind of like rolling our eyes like yeah
00:25:09 Yeah, we get it we get it, but then the moment where it goes from and that's uh is when he goes
00:25:16 This is why we need
00:25:19 Objective standards and art to make sure people like this can be stopped and it's like oh hold on there, buddy
00:25:26 Paul Joseph Anderson, that's the video game guy, right?
00:25:29 Paul Joseph Watson Watson. Oh shit. I'm getting my Paul Joseph
00:25:32 I'm not sure you said what Watson at least that I don't know am I crazy am I crazy? Okay?
00:25:38 I don't know the audience will judge anyway. Yeah, the YouTube guy who has the big fucking chipmunk face that he puts in the middle
00:25:45 Of the camera all the time. I feel like he used the fish island or he has the world's most bulbous face that guy
00:25:50 That's what yeah, um he uh
00:25:52 Yeah, so like he made the case that we need objective standards to stop these people and that's where it's like, okay
00:25:57 This is no longer an opinion thing. This is now a fucking good like socio-political thing
00:26:01 We have to maintain objective standards of quality and talent in order to discern the value of anything and
00:26:11 Munchie you just got done watching the clap the modern classic
00:26:15 Why is modern art so bad video by Prager University, which I just did a 40 minute rebuttal video to on my main channel
00:26:21 But now I'm here in this podcast a shit on me even more like it's from this guy
00:26:25 Who's like probably a Christian very like an old funny that he conservative type guy and he's a painter
00:26:30 Probably Christian right and like I went to his I went to his website
00:26:34 All right, Munchie over here
00:26:35 I went to this guy's website to look at his art and you can tell that he's like into classic style art
00:26:40 But he's not that good at it it ends up looking more like sci-fi pulp novel covers
00:26:44 But you can tell he's a classicist and in this video he makes the case for classic art being better than modern art
00:26:49 Which is fine at all except he then shits on the idea of
00:26:52 Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and that like shit is subjective
00:26:56 And that we need to bring back objective standards in order to stop these people the great art historian
00:27:02 Jacob Rosenberg wrote that quality and art is not merely a matter of personal opinion
00:27:07 But to a high degree objectively traceable without aesthetic standards
00:27:12 We have no way to determine quality or inferiority as if it's somehow like a drag on you
00:27:17 That scribble paintings and square paintings are popular like like you don't need to
00:27:23 Right, you don't need to kick out art
00:27:26 You don't like to make room for yourself like make art that you think is good
00:27:31 And make it good enough to get your own fucking attention
00:27:35 I I I think what he's responding to is the the the culture that has come to embrace this thing that he finds to be, you know
00:27:43 Unvaluable and well
00:27:45 I I literally do not understand what you're saying. So you're saying why do we think why why do we shit on bad youtubers
00:27:53 When we praise modern art, uh, I mean not so it's it's just that if you're saying that the skill doesn't matter
00:27:59 Right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And the execution matters. I'll tell you why
00:28:04 Because it's not a matter of the skill being bad that makes youtubers bad
00:28:08 It's that the art they make is terrible
00:28:11 But we do not like the art that they produce and and that that statement that you're saying implies implicitly
00:28:19 That that modern art is bad that we do not like it and we're just saying
00:28:23 Oh, you don't need skill to in you and making bad art is okay
00:28:26 When we're saying that you don't need a skill to make art that we like and resonate with we like marinara or at least I do
00:28:33 I like my art so I can explain away why the skill doesn't matter and I can explain and make an intellectual point about it
00:28:39 I'm not saying that
00:28:40 modern art is bad and therefore
00:28:43 The skill does not matter because you can make bad art and it doesn't matter the point of the matter is
00:28:47 Simply I like modern art and I don't like youtuber. Uh, you know shitty youtube reviews
00:28:53 And that's fine. You don't have to like you don't have to like modern art or anything
00:28:58 Okay, I think I want to say like I
00:29:00 Quite dislike modern art. I will say but I will but I you know
00:29:05 I I recognize why I dislike it
00:29:08 I recognize why I dislike it and I'm fine with people creating it. I you know
00:29:12 I'm free to dislike it and they're free to create it
00:29:15 There's no issue here between me and the people who create modern art
00:29:18 Well mage that is the you have cowardice in your convictions
00:29:21 You should demand that the world conform to your expectations. Therefore you're you you're either a coward or lying
00:29:28 Which is it mage? Which is it?
00:29:30 Anything less is a kid
00:29:32 Okay
00:29:35 Nate
00:29:36 Yes, I'll just bring this up and I don't know if we'll have anything interesting to say about it, but whatever
00:29:43 Come on. It's me. Of course. I will do you know
00:29:45 Did you know you probably did know that we have a
00:29:48 Like a second cousin or a cousin once removed or whatever that is a like a
00:29:54 Supposedly a pretty successful like somewhat famous abstract painter. I believe is his name winston. His name is winston
00:30:01 That's right. Yep. I mean should we like link him or should we say like his website or something?
00:30:06 Is it winston saint or winston bestman? I'm gonna lean towards no
00:30:10 That's a good question. I mean towards no and then maybe we'll add in the description or something. Okay, whatever
00:30:15 It it doesn't matter. Uh, yeah in winston. It's winston the girl picture him
00:30:20 I went to i'm at his i'm at his website and i'm just looking at his art and I gotta say you know kind of like with jackson paul like
00:30:27 I don't really get it
00:30:29 Although okay, sometimes I find I'm looking at these and some of the aesthetics are good and I'll be like, oh, that's a nice like collection of colors
00:30:36 That's a nice thing for the most part. I'm like
00:30:41 I don't like it
00:30:42 Okay, but but maybe maybe the point maybe the point is just you know
00:30:46 You you combine colors and whatever and like
00:30:48 You know like most of them will not appeal to most people
00:30:51 But some of them will appeal to some people and you sometimes sometimes you just get lucky and find your audience of someone
00:30:57 Who is like, oh that looks neat and then they buy it and I don't know
00:31:01 We're behind modern art as I understand it was a rejection of these styles and forms that had been used in classical art
00:31:08 Up to that point. Whereas that guy in that video that prager you video was talking about how like no like
00:31:13 Images used to like capture beauty and convey grandiose messages and use technical skill and these are the things we celebrate
00:31:20 But but like our boy our boy w here is like
00:31:24 The big w. Uh, he's he's like he's just attempting to like
00:31:29 Throw images out there and I guess like see what sticks and I'm sure you made like a lot of art
00:31:35 I think that's probably what painters do. I think that's probably what
00:31:39 I quickly want to say about the you know, the whole skill doesn't matter thing now
00:31:43 The thing is like skill definitely helps
00:31:47 In many ways and in many in many times
00:31:49 However, it's not like it's it's not mandatory because sometimes people who are very good at
00:31:55 Executing things can just catch lightning in a bottle. So to speak and
00:32:00 That's I was actually going to ask that is it possible. Is it possible that skill?
00:32:06 Holds you back from experimentation and that you're and that it that no human's ability could ever rival like the kind of
00:32:15 Electric
00:32:17 Stumble into if you're just if you're just trying random shit hold on no
00:32:21 So one of the things that keep in mind is that one of the things I've by the way just for fun
00:32:25 I posted the links to winston stuff in the chat and I checked out we will decide we will decide if we're gonna post
00:32:31 We will judge winston
00:32:33 This has obvious skill and intent in it. You think something good. Yeah. Yeah a lot of it
00:32:37 There is skill there not saying. Oh, yeah, this is really nice. I like these colors
00:32:40 I like how the colors are mixed some of them
00:32:42 I do like there are definitely ones here that are the first paint to get the very beginning has this like cool
00:32:47 Like fucking like circle in the middle. Yeah. Yeah, that's the one talk about potential images that won't be in the
00:32:53 video
00:32:54 No, let's what we'll show this first one because it's not now. Let's edit this in we'll edit this in yeah, so
00:33:00 So I had a comment
00:33:03 That was me stretching by the way not me being frustrated by ed people
00:33:06 So I had a comment say I grew up
00:33:09 Hating Rothko mark Rothko until I saw one of his paintings in a museum
00:33:16 Like eye to eye in person, right?
00:33:19 Mark Rothko is the guy who paints just like squares, right? And it's like what the what the I remember
00:33:24 Paul joseph watzkerson
00:33:26 Specifically calling out Rothko. He's just he just drew a red square. What the fuck right thing is when people like analyze mark
00:33:32 Rothko when you read up on him apparently what he does is he layers his painting his paint over and over
00:33:39 And over again
00:33:40 It gives it a sense of depth that cannot be captured in photography and then transmitted on to a digital screen
00:33:47 You have to see it in person and when you do
00:33:50 People say the images feel like they they become like three dimensional the images feel like they're floating in space because they're so
00:33:58 richly textured, right
00:34:01 there is something that he is doing there and
00:34:05 uh
00:34:06 Interesting thing about both Rothko and Pollock is when you research their histories
00:34:11 They both started off doing actual painting like that where their technical skill is obviously much more clear where they're drawing people or stuff
00:34:19 Like they both started out, you know pretty post-modernist
00:34:21 They weren't like classicists
00:34:23 But they both started drawing stuff that you obviously could not imitate right
00:34:26 They both started off with sketches and drawing things and then devolved their
00:34:31 complexity more and more and more as they continued to experiment and basically just got to the very heart of why they really wanted to paint
00:34:39 Right, they just went to down to the bread and butter of what they actually had been wanting to express and took 10 years
00:34:45 Of stylistic development in order to get there
00:34:49 And what did they want to express right?
00:34:51 Well, then when you try to explain that when you hear what other people explain
00:34:54 This goes back to my problem at the beginning where they try to explain it using these very tangible
00:34:58 almost objective terminology
00:35:00 Like, you know, it's supposed to express your the human condition of the feeling of the thought of the feeling of the whatever, right?
00:35:05 uh, I think
00:35:07 Yeah, um, and another thing is that it is definitely true like okay
00:35:13 I had someone I had another comment saying, you know, if someone told me they're an artist and then they showed me Pollock
00:35:19 I wouldn't take them seriously
00:35:21 Right like he doesn't take he doesn't regard Pollock as real art. He's like, yeah, you know
00:35:25 Most are you know, you have to actually consider what you're doing and have a point in a theme and skill and effort, right?
00:35:32 So what I said was okay go to ms paint pick whichever tools you like
00:35:36 Select four colors that you think are good
00:35:39 And then use whatever tools you want on ms paint to make a pattern with those colors
00:35:44 The pattern cannot be symmetrical. It has to be like it has to look chaotic
00:35:48 But the colors have to be evenly distributed. There can't be too much red on this corner
00:35:55 There can't be too little blue in the middle
00:35:56 There it has to be evenly distributed while also being chaotic and he he came up with an image that was you know
00:36:01 Shitty looking but it did fulfill what I requested and he's like, okay. That was kind of interesting, right?
00:36:06 And I'm like, there you go, right? This isn't something you can do effortlessly the the video. Uh, why is modern art so bad?
00:36:12 This fucking funny duddy said he would go up to his art students because I guess he's a professor
00:36:17 and he would show them a picture of a
00:36:19 A Jackson Pollock painting and he said analyze this Jackson. Yeah analyze this Jackson Pollock painting
00:36:26 And explain why it is good
00:36:28 And then they would say oh, it's deep. It's bold and then he'd be like it's actually a close-up of my studio apron
00:36:34 It's just a bunch of smears. You've been duped
00:36:38 Uptrolled
00:36:40 Right now. First of all, we'll just over
00:36:42 Congratulation people have found art within your studio. Yeah, good job. You should sell that for money, right?
00:36:48 So we'll just I'll just like sort of pass anything the fact that he presented with them a false question
00:36:53 I think I think that what that says is not anything about Pollock
00:36:58 I mean, it just it's just that hold on. Hold on. I think I think can be aesthetically pleasing even if there's no
00:37:04 Like there's so many things wrong with it though. I've been pouring over it for a fucking week in my mind
00:37:09 First of all, he specifically phrases it as analyze this Jackson Pollock painting
00:37:15 And explain why it is good
00:37:20 He's sure he said it was a Jackson Pollock. Are you sure about that? He said that he tricks them. He lies
00:37:26 Listen to the video. He did lie. So he did lie. Okay, and he specifically says explain
00:37:31 Why it is good. He doesn't say tell me what you think of it, right? Yeah
00:37:36 Now
00:37:37 Right, that is a bit loaded. That is when he presents when he presented the video when I first watched it, right?
00:37:41 He didn't explain it to the audience of the of the video that it was going to be a trick
00:37:45 I see the Jackson Pollock painting and I'm like, oh, I don't care for it. It looks stupid. I don't I don't get it, right?
00:37:50 It's dull. Oh, yes. It's kind of wise devout wise devout knew better. Yes. Thank god
00:37:55 Here's the thing, right? I didn't fall for the trick because I
00:37:59 I don't have a fucking art professor telling me the objective standard should be a fucking thing
00:38:05 Right. Exactly. I don't let people tell me what the fucking thing
00:38:09 This guy fucking lies. This guy fucks dude. This guy fucks
00:38:13 Yeah, he he is from a position of authority and telling them what you say exactly he didn't ask them to express themselves
00:38:20 He told them to say why it's good for people. So the people there, you know, they're trying to come up with reasons why it's good
00:38:27 They might not necessarily like it, but they're trying to fulfill
00:38:30 Right, that's the big problem with that whole thing is because he's in a position of authority
00:38:35 And this is this is like, but this is this this touches on something that I think
00:38:39 Because like I'm not a huge fan of post modern modern art whatever but like people can make it
00:38:43 I don't give a shit. It doesn't bother me. What I don't like
00:38:46 Is the culture
00:38:48 Around it because I think there's there's a lot of like the problem that I had in my experience because like
00:38:53 I went to museums during art school and shit and I looked at all this stuff
00:38:57 And that was like fine. Like I wasn't super engaged in it. That was fine
00:39:01 What I hated was the students and the teachers that liked it because there was this culture of of of of
00:39:09 I'm going to project why this is so good
00:39:13 And then everyone is going to like the public
00:39:16 Kind of looks up to these people authority like the people in the galleries and stuff and they're like, oh
00:39:21 They know better than me. So I'm going to try and like pull the meaning out of it
00:39:26 Even though I don't I'm going to lie to myself
00:39:28 To conform to social standards
00:39:31 Everything everything that I have heard about the I'm no expert but everything that I have heard about the modern like fine art
00:39:38 painting community
00:39:40 Suggest to me that what it pretty much is is just a bunch of rich people
00:39:45 Are bored and decide that such and such is the new thing
00:39:50 And then it becomes really and then it becomes really expensive
00:39:54 So they can all so they can all spend their money on it and then talk about why that culture is probably really fucked
00:39:59 But so again, I want to reiterate my platform here is to shoot down people who who want to elect the god
00:40:05 The great leader of objective standards to overthrow this culture
00:40:09 It's basically like finding the great communist leader to overthrow the capitalist system. It's a very very ill-conceived idea
00:40:16 Well when divu earlier mentioned about how he rolled his eyes when he read about people trying to describe or explain the paintings and stuff like that
00:40:24 I think like for me personally
00:40:26 I know why that would hurt me a lot because like whenever I you know do art and stuff and
00:40:32 I I would try to like I try to imagine people trying to analyze my art on that level
00:40:38 It would it just so would annoy me because they're probably going to get it wrong because there's not that much thought put into paintings
00:40:45 It's usually like in art. It's usually a lot of emotions and not a lot of reason
00:40:50 I could be wrong. There could be a lot of people who touchfully put every single dot or whatever, but well major
00:40:56 I'm glad to say that
00:40:57 I wanted to I wanted to raise a counter argument to some of this because okay guys
00:41:02 Uh, we've been we've been shitting a lot on modern art and postmodern art. You know general not everybody, but no, we have
00:41:07 No, we haven't we've been defending it
00:41:09 Tom, I mean tom has okay fair enough. I haven't done anything. I just said I didn't like it
00:41:14 I specifically opened with I don't like it. Okay, you know what I'll say to those people out there who who find it
00:41:20 Invaluable or in what not? Here's what I'm saying. Invaluable means it's valuable kind of like inflammable means it's flammable
00:41:26 God damn it. I can't catch a break today. All right. Uh, listen
00:41:31 Imagine that you are jackson pollock and you're in your studio and I'm saying this I'm looked at
00:41:35 I looked up pictures of jackson jackson pollock when he's working on his shit
00:41:38 Imagine you are out there every day working for like eight hours, which I'm projecting. I'm assuming he does this
00:41:43 You know, he's dead now, but whatever and you're in your studio and every day you spend all day throwing paint on a canvas
00:41:50 And trying new techniques to achieve more interesting effects
00:41:53 And you do this and your art your art gallery is filled with like things that you have
00:41:58 Tested these new techniques on that you have been slaving a way to try to make this thing happen
00:42:03 And then you pick the best of the best that you think are the most evocative convey the most
00:42:08 Just you can't even describe what it conveys. It just is interesting to look at and then and and yes
00:42:14 And you sell for a tons of money because they're popular and then you have people say well, I could have done that
00:42:19 Well, I could have done that, you know, what after like a lifetime spent honing this craft of experiment
00:42:25 I'm sure there's interviews of him talking about it because it's not like this was something that like came up as a criticism
00:42:30 After the fact this is sort of like what got him popular was people huddling around being like is this even like is this
00:42:36 It's funny that we use pollock as an example though because jackson pollock became famous not even because people liked his art
00:42:42 It was because he was from new york and he looked like an all-american kind of guy and like at that
00:42:48 No, seriously at that time the uh, like the whatever art movement he was a part of it
00:42:52 It was like big in like france in europe and people like in new york
00:42:55 They wanted it to be american so there was a photo of jackson pollock wearing a cowboy hat and it looked stereotypically american
00:43:01 So they specifically chose him to make him popular and pull that movement back to america
00:43:07 So he was the k-pop star of his era basically that tom that tom that is really really really depressing
00:43:14 Um
00:43:18 Guys who the fuck
00:43:21 Thought it was an okay idea to change the topic on the day of recording gib you weren't even here
00:43:28 Why would we have to worry about what you think you're not even here piss?
00:43:31 This is the topic. This is the thing I have the most to say about and the topic was changed an hour late
00:43:38 And you didn't show up on time. Well, you're here now. What can we do?
00:43:41 He didn't think that this would be the topic. So he didn't have a reason to show up. He didn't have a reason to show
00:43:46 Yeah, that's fair. That's no, that's fair. Yeah, but yeah, so now that you're here. Are you recording?
00:43:52 Oh, oh, oh, you're oh, this is a topic you want to talk about. Oh, absolutely. Yeah, youtube alternatives was a piece of shit topic
00:43:59 I didn't want to do it
00:44:01 Agreed and this is the the most
00:44:04 I'm so mad. I don't this should never ever happen. Well, why why you're here now
00:44:09 I'm angry that it has happened and I'm gonna clip the mic right now. That's what I'm doing
00:44:16 To for brevity's sake, I'll just say my general top like stance on modern art. It's good
00:44:23 Jackson Pollock is shit and I don't like him
00:44:25 But that's where did you hear what we were saying about Jackson?
00:44:28 I jumped in and you were talking about him and he always gets brought up because
00:44:33 He rides the line some say
00:44:35 The the way I view art
00:44:37 Modern art or otherwise is that if it's good, I like it and if it's not it sucks
00:44:41 And the fact that it's modern doesn't have anything to do with us
00:44:45 Yeah, I think Jackson Pollock is probably much better seen in person than uh, you know, fia fucking digital
00:44:51 Yeah, media whatever
00:44:54 There's a painting downstairs in my in like a little book nook
00:44:58 Near our porch and it is I mean, it's just a bunch of fucking colors
00:45:02 Maybe I'll take a picture of it and like upload it and it can go on the screen
00:45:05 Yeah, that's just it's just a bunch of colors and like there's some like blotches of like silver paint on it in like squares
00:45:11 And like, you know, it's whatever it doesn't it doesn't mean anything
00:45:15 But but the colors are deep and rich and it's like these beautiful jewel tones like kind of coming out of like a kind of black
00:45:22 sort of general black
00:45:24 Area and there's these just the silver the silver
00:45:27 Square is just kind of like cut through there and they kind of like fade at some of the corners
00:45:31 And it's like it's like the thing has been stamped with like a spiral like stamp or something
00:45:35 So it has this like this weird like like tactile like ridges to it
00:45:40 And I love this fucking painting because it's got like it's really just textural and like beautiful in those colors
00:45:47 I know that we've been exposing our ignorance by by just fucking mentioning like Pollock constantly
00:45:52 But he's just the one that I happened to like get treated about him. I'm super ignorant
00:45:57 He's well Pollock is emblematic like okay. I don't I don't know that much
00:46:01 I couldn't name that many like painters of this style honestly
00:46:05 But Pollock is emblematic as someone who is like basically all you know all aesthetic and no like no concrete like like
00:46:13 Subject matter right right now
00:46:15 That's one of the things that people brought up as one of the painting's strengths
00:46:18 Is that there are no like centerpieces in his paintings where your eyes are definitively drawn to which is actually
00:46:25 A lot harder than you think so this guy in my comment section who I I challenged to do something sort of like a Pollock
00:46:31 What he ended up doing was he made a whole bunch of very definitive shapes that he himself expressed
00:46:37 Uh, dislike with because they drove him nuts right the thing about Pollock is that they're so
00:46:41 Interwoven and all the shapes are so minimal and they're in themselves that there's just no beginning or end to his painting
00:46:48 I'm gonna I'm gonna contest that because most of his paintings are on canvas which have edges
00:46:54 So there's going to be a middle point
00:46:56 How like like if you if you want to take it to to a degree where it's like
00:47:01 Where does the art begin and end? He should just take like get a paint like bomb grenade and throw it into a room
00:47:07 Yeah
00:47:08 So the last thing I'll mention about Pollock. I swear to god is is yeah the the guy who did the the fucking apron meme
00:47:15 prank bro
00:47:17 Someone in my comments also mentioned that that fucking apron does not in any way look like a Jackson Pollock painting
00:47:23 His apron is a bunch of fucking smudges
00:47:26 And the smudges are of way too many colors all turning into a big brownie mess
00:47:31 And they're mostly cornered in the upper left corner, right Jackson Pollock's paintings are
00:47:36 splatter paintings
00:47:38 Not smudges with very limited well considered colors and are very evenly distributed
00:47:44 I so like it's not just random. I knew that it was not a painting. It was something like some sort of goading
00:47:50 I I I had something to say about that because I I saw you that what you linked it before debut
00:47:56 And I watched it and I'm like, yeah, this guy this guy's a fucking silly billy
00:48:00 But the thing he has about like art students
00:48:03 Faking that they're smart about things is definitely something that happens and a lot of people in the art world
00:48:09 Just sort of nobody knows what art is or what is like
00:48:13 Correct
00:48:14 But people there's this general idea that there is something correct
00:48:17 So people have to you know pretend constantly and they get wrapped up in their own like weakness like oh, yes
00:48:24 It's it's inspiring. It's this and that but they don't actually know what they're saying. I want to contest that
00:48:30 I I have uh, okay
00:48:31 This is we we've been we've frankly wasted a ton of our viewers in our time here because these are the facts of the matter
00:48:37 All right classical art modern art post modern art
00:48:40 They have one thing in common and it's that they're all equally worthless. All right, the best art
00:48:45 The best art is that that which uh, uh, achieves some
00:48:50 Real world impact and that is why the greatest the greatest artwork that was ever made was literally the uncle sam
00:48:57 I want you for the us army poster. That is the greatest piece of artwork
00:49:01 Could we just have one episode where you don't devolve into retardation one episode? No
00:49:07 I refuse that call. This is what about Aaron and me. What about gran lugen?
00:49:12 Well, okay, there is something to be said for inspirational stuff that that uh, that that conveys some larger truth
00:49:18 Uh, it adjoys more people point up and point for what?
00:49:22 My favorite thing is not about
00:49:25 like
00:49:26 Practical effect like like art is why not. Why what's wrong with art that it's not about that is my question
00:49:33 my ganda
00:49:35 Yeah, like you're like, no, that's okay. That was effective as propaganda, but that doesn't mean that it succeeds as art
00:49:41 I mean, maybe it does. The thing about that is that the art was not responsible for people joining them the the military
00:49:47 That that uncle sam was extremely it was provocative extremely. Yeah, but the thing is that's not the sole reason people join the military
00:49:55 That's not the sole. I mean like the flat the american flag is more in the context
00:49:59 American flag is more of a thing and then also like
00:50:01 Just advertising and like pushing like yeah people talking about it and you know speeches that the president said
00:50:07 Those are all equally going towards the same goal. You can't say that that poster is the art that made it all happen
00:50:14 Probably most of the classical art is the most classical art. I believe is propaganda for christianity, right?
00:50:20 Yeah, that's that's right. It depends like a majestic and inspiring. No, generally to celebrate
00:50:26 Well, well, how do you apply propaganda to that? I mean, you know
00:50:29 Well propaganda is it's made with us with the intent of you know, fucking
00:50:35 I don't know doing something. Well, I guess if you're like a really religious person and you make an art just because you love
00:50:39 Jesus so much that isn't immediately propaganda like I think the intent
00:50:43 Yeah, but with this fucking commissioned by the church for you to paint in their fucking buildings
00:50:47 It's obviously like trying to make the building more inviting
00:50:50 I I mean, I guess you could argue that that is their building that like where that I mean they are already down with Jesus
00:50:55 So like they're not trying to convince. No, they're trying. Well, no, they bring fucking people
00:51:00 That's how Christianity works. That's literally how the Catholic church writes. What's monkey's favorite thing about Nate?
00:51:04 I want to hear
00:51:05 My my favorite my favorite thing about Nate is that his two modes are completely memeing and no sincerity and then
00:51:13 Trying to have philosophical
00:51:14 Debates those two go together so well, dude. I gotta tell you they really
00:51:19 And then and then when he breaks out the insightful ideas on the podcast he says them in the most
00:51:24 Obviously outrageous and me me way that no one could ever possibly leave them
00:51:29 But then just keeps presenting them over and over again like that and then everyone has to slowly
00:51:34 Stop chuckling and be like well, Nate. That's retarded. And then I don't what are you talking about?
00:51:39 What are you saying post modern art? All right, like what post modern art specifically is is like look at this toilet
00:51:46 I'm calling it art. I submit like ooh gotcha
00:51:50 You are celebrating this thing because I got you all mixed up in your fucking head to be like, oh, that's art
00:51:54 But secretly I knew that it's just a fucking toilet. It's nothing you you fools
00:51:58 I tricked you like so it's basically it's just saying that like art is bullshit
00:52:02 But but my question is what is more valuable about classical art that like guys like that guy in that video are like celebrating
00:52:11 I agree. Okay. I think okay. Here's here's my theory. Tell me if I'm wrong and if there's a tangent final stop
00:52:17 But it's like I feel like what guys like this guy are saying is
00:52:21 He thinks that like a world where classical art is celebrated and made more
00:52:27 Is like better because we've got like expectations for like what beauty is and like what the world is and I can understand
00:52:34 Is the point someone like that is trying to really he just likes them
00:52:37 Yeah, yeah classical art
00:52:39 If you wanted if you wanted to do something like Michelangelo or da Vinci that requires
00:52:45 years of study
00:52:47 And which obviously he respects obviously he can not imitate. I looked at his paintings. They're not that good
00:52:53 Right. So like I think I think and like there's while you can't argue objective standards
00:52:58 There is no arguing that objectively it takes more time study and effort
00:53:03 To be a Michelangelo than it is to put a signature on a used toilet and put it in a gallery
00:53:08 And I think people if you stop looking at it at that level
00:53:12 Then I think a lot of people that's where they stop the analyzation. It's just like, yeah, this takes more effort
00:53:17 Therefore, it's better for a great another great counter example. There's this one guy
00:53:20 I don't remember what he's called or what his his comic was called, but he has this youtube video called
00:53:26 Oh, shit
00:53:27 The main title is something like how to not waste time on your art but the subtitle that you oh
00:53:32 Is the guy who's like he he's making a video how it took like 10 years to make his comic because he kept putting like
00:53:38 Insane line arts in his background. He did the comic about his trip to Japan, right?
00:53:42 Yeah, the subtitle of this video is from a guy who spent 13 years drawing a comic where yeah, he he used like
00:53:50 He's yeah 13 years drawing a three volume comic
00:53:55 So it's like four or five years per volume right and he explained and if you look at it
00:53:59 It's not that impressive like it's just it's just black and white like cartoony art
00:54:03 It's not like he like recreated some high-level mangaka or anything
00:54:06 It's just a guy's name. The guy's name is lars martinson. Uh, if anyone wants to look him up
00:54:11 It's a good video
00:54:12 Yeah, yeah, because because basically he explained that it took so long
00:54:15 Because he decided to use like he wanted it to look like certain styles
00:54:18 So he used like certain tools and pens and like inks that are like a pain in the fucking ass
00:54:24 and he also
00:54:26 He made all shadows hatching for yeah cross hatching decided to make that
00:54:31 Which takes super long and he drew every background
00:54:34 He never reused a background and sometimes he would have a very busy image
00:54:38 Even when it didn't need to be in the context of the story
00:54:40 So there you go
00:54:41 That's a good example of like putting effort and that you don't get your money's worth from it
00:54:45 Right kids remember this do not be precious about your projects
00:54:49 Get it done and get the next one rolling and you will you will get better art in the end than you would have
00:54:54 Just be precious forever to change be open to failure be open to failure. Yeah. Yeah, and yeah, you know
00:55:00 It's important. It's important. So like um
00:55:03 Oh people like Pollack fucking and other people like Rothko, right?
00:55:07 It is true that it didn't take as much work because like what had to go into it for consideration is a lot quicker
00:55:12 Right and you can see like Pollack in his studio that they have documentaries of him
00:55:16 He's obviously focusing pretty fucking hard like he's not just being random
00:55:20 But the point is he did make hundreds of those styles of paintings in the span of a decade and so did Rothko
00:55:27 I believe and so it's like, okay, clearly. This isn't as difficult to make right the thing is though
00:55:32 They made hundreds of paintings like the prolificity does count for some those like the paintings are not an accident
00:55:39 Like even even if an individual like okay, it's kind of like photography like you're you're you might be capturing a moment
00:55:45 That just happened to happen. Okay. Yeah, do you know there's like there's like a grand total like don't interrupt me. I will destroy you
00:55:51 You're making hundreds and hundreds of these splatter paintings or whatever
00:55:55 And then you know, you're finding your techniques and and you know, you're you're you're ending up with all these products
00:56:01 And you know, sometimes you have you might have a happy accident and something looks really good
00:56:04 And then maybe a hundred other times it looks like crap and then you take the good ones and you're like like this one
00:56:09 Looks really good. It's got some visually is interesting going on
00:56:12 So, you know, I'm gonna present this one to my fucking fans or whatever
00:56:16 You know, it's selective exclusion
00:56:18 Curation helpful in this curation is the ultimate art form perhaps perhaps so
00:56:23 You could argue that everything is curation, I guess, but but it's like
00:56:27 What I have found is very helpful in this process is sometimes when I'm recording a video
00:56:31 I'll do a bunch of takes. I do this with we got it wasn't just everything. I'll do a bunch of takes of a line
00:56:36 I'll do like a motion several times and like I find more often than not and I'm expand this in a second
00:56:43 But it's like more often than not
00:56:44 It's not one that I expected to be the good one that when I've got it in the editing bay
00:56:48 And it's time to to make this part of the final product
00:56:51 I look through the clips and I I pick one of them and it's not like in that one moment where I did it
00:56:56 I had some brilliant insight necessarily, you know, maybe I did something different
00:57:00 But it's just that like oh that one happened to go better
00:57:03 And so I pick that one and by doing that for like every take throughout the video
00:57:06 You get the best of the best of the best for the whole thing
00:57:09 And you know, like that is the process by which you produce something that's really good
00:57:13 And I mean, yes, you can be precious with everything and do takes to get them perfect
00:57:16 And you're like that was the one but like this is another
00:57:20 Another curation form of makes it good. What are you just saying not to worry about it and just get it out there?
00:57:25 And I was saying you do everything five times and no, no, no
00:57:27 No, listen what I'm saying is what I'm saying is I there's nothing wrong
00:57:31 If you if you're not sure if something's coming out good or bad
00:57:33 Don't just accept that it's bad like there's a level of degrees here. You need to accept doing five takes of something
00:57:38 Uh, if like for example, if I'm doing like an intro to we Agua like they're they're very random and chaotic
00:57:43 And I just make whatever the fuck up off the top of my head
00:57:45 But I will do it several times because I'll know that like I probably won't get it like looking perfect one time
00:57:51 But if I have five to work with it's it takes like, you know five minutes as opposed to one minute to record
00:57:55 And I give myself that much more likelihood of having the material I need to work with to make it acceptable in the end
00:58:01 So, you know, did you know that Stanley Kubrick when filming
00:58:05 Dr. Strange Love or how I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb
00:58:09 How that movie is famous because everyone acts like a goofball in it
00:58:13 None of the actors knew that that was how the movie was going to be
00:58:17 During the entire process of filming Kubrick said, oh, yeah. Well, let's have some
00:58:24 Improvised takes on the script here
00:58:26 So I'm just gonna film like sort of us doing the script
00:58:29 But goofy just to kind of you know, like like grease the wheels loosen up a bit and don't worry guys
00:58:34 All of you Hollywood actors you take yourself very seriously
00:58:37 We will then film the serious version
00:58:39 Don't worry and literally told none of them
00:58:42 They had to show up to the fucking premiere to find out that he used all the goofy takes
00:58:48 Similarly to how he actually swapped out the soundtrack for 2001 a space Odyssey near the end and didn't tell the guy who made the original version
00:58:55 That that's great
00:58:56 And that adds to my point because it's entirely possible that Kubrick didn't realize he was going to do that until the editing process
00:59:03 Uh, I'm pretty sure he did no Kubrick is evil. Kubrick was an evil evil man who deceived everyone for the sake of his movies
00:59:10 Maybe he did maybe he did that's fine
00:59:12 But okay, I'm gonna pretend that he didn't do it on purpose and that he did in the editing bay because here's my point
00:59:17 And and what I'm saying is like a lot of the times when I've got when I when I'm just like
00:59:21 Ah, fuck it. I just need to get this thing done and I film the materials and I put it in the editing bay
00:59:26 That's when I'm able to be honestly like my most creative and
00:59:30 Giving yourself the tools to proceed and get something done. Just it allows you to play with a more
00:59:38 Narrow down
00:59:39 palette that you can experiment with and do stuff with and that
00:59:43 Is honestly a very helpful thing to to get something finally done it out the door and make it and and that is not something
00:59:49 That you can really plan out ahead of time. You can but I'd argue it's inefficient or at least that it doesn't work for me personally
00:59:55 So, uh, yeah, that's what I'm saying. Do you have more things to say? I hope I hope you don't feel stifled in this topic
01:00:00 Because if you say it's your ultimate topic, I have to hear it. Well, I don't have anything to say about film
01:00:07 I I most of what I have in like my brain is like
01:00:13 People hate modern art for stupid reasons and I hate them
01:00:17 But I don't know what you've already like discussed or whether you've gone over that or not
01:00:20 Just feel free to like risk repeating shit. Go ahead
01:00:25 I don't know
01:00:26 Art's good. What do you think about post-modern art though? What do you mean like the toilet on the pedestal?
01:00:31 What do you think about that? I think I think what do you think about toilets? You want to get shit?
01:00:34 Oh
01:00:37 For my shit you fat slut
01:00:40 Um post-modern art. I mean, it's the same thing
01:00:44 For me if it's good, then I like it. So like, um
01:00:48 Something doesn't necessarily need a lot of effort to be put into it
01:00:51 But if it's like they and you know a toilet is like a terrible
01:00:55 It's a piece of shit, you know lull
01:00:57 um
01:00:59 The worst post-modern artist or like artist I've ever seen in my life and I hate her is tracy emin
01:01:05 She got famous for doing like a piece where it was her bed. She had a bed with like, um
01:01:11 You know wrappers and and dust and and grime and certain of dirty duvet
01:01:16 And it was just all like in on the middle of the floor
01:01:18 This is what it's like for me to wake up in the morning and it was all grungy and horrible and everyone was
01:01:24 Trey tracy emin
01:01:27 Yeah
01:01:29 Really don't like her face
01:01:32 I've seen her also on like a few like tv shows about like
01:01:36 Where she's like a judge of like post-modern artist, uh, like contestant things is awful awful person
01:01:43 I not an awful person, but awful art. I hate her
01:01:46 But like um, you know her art looks like she looks like to kind of like like people who do like little four panel comics of
01:01:51 What it's like being a neurotic girl and your periods are getting all over the place and you get like 20 000 retweets
01:01:56 It's just it's just like nothing but more squiggly
01:01:59 Well, yeah, um
01:02:01 That some post-modern art can be really funny
01:02:05 You know, it just depends on what statement they're making and whether I agree with it basically
01:02:10 Um one time in in college, uh, this is this is gonna get me in trouble. Maybe
01:02:15 Uh, I I did a funny post-modern thing. I got like a stuff. I got a like a stuffed little little monkey
01:02:21 And I got some black cloth and I made it a little burqa
01:02:25 And and that was my project and the teacher was like, uh, okay. Why and I explained why and it was all about like
01:02:34 shock value being like, um, you know
01:02:38 It's all in the person's head. It's not a burqa. It's not like I'm saying anything. It's just like it's cute
01:02:42 Isn't it it's a cute little monkey and it's just so happens to be a muslim woman
01:02:46 Like what's so what's so wrong about that and they they they were okay with it
01:02:50 And I wrote an essay like explaining my my thought process and that was I mean in in art college
01:02:55 That's what you have to do is you have to explain it in a way that the teachers can understand
01:03:01 If you just say it's uh, it I was inspired by x and I did the same thing that I was inspired by
01:03:08 Can I have a mark that's high please? It's like no, that's not how it works
01:03:12 You gotta be smart the number one thing I learned in art school was to bullshit like that's yeah
01:03:17 One thing I really hate now
01:03:19 I did say that like people are free to express themselves on something and I'm free to dislike it and what I really really dislike
01:03:25 I hate to even bring it up is like a lot of this feminist quote-unquote art
01:03:30 Because a lot of it has to do with like
01:03:32 Periods and like they're literally plopping plopping fucking like eggs out of a vagina on a canvas to like like it publicly
01:03:39 Yeah, yeah hitting my oldie position fetish dog
01:03:43 Yeah art and then like
01:03:46 Painting with period blood or like putting wool in your vagina and pulling it out and making a sweater or something out of it
01:03:52 People have painted with shit their own shit before why I know and that's disgusting too
01:03:56 But like why does feminists aren't always have to do with periods of vaginas?
01:04:00 That's great
01:04:02 I always does
01:04:04 Is it is it an idea of like is it the fact that we find it gross what they're trying to like fix with that?
01:04:10 You know, yeah, I think the thing is like they're celebrating it. You know, they're celebrating their womanhood, but also it's it's beautiful
01:04:18 Yeah, I mean, michelle. I don't I said michelle. I meant mage
01:04:22 Oh
01:04:25 You always do that you all you view all women is the same
01:04:29 Yeah, one of these days I'm gonna ruin the podcast Nate yet again. Oh, please call me mom. Oh
01:04:36 Yeah, you'd like that wouldn't you uh, uh, I don't know what you're saying mage, but all I'm hearing is a whole lot of internalized massaging
01:04:43 That's all it's definitely a lot of
01:04:47 It would be a more it would be a more effective
01:04:50 Thing to do like for shock value if it hadn't become a cliche
01:04:54 Yes, well at this point. That's true. Can we criticize the people who led up to the point where it became cliche though?
01:05:00 Like because they were you know, they were doing something new, right?
01:05:03 You know what on the same subject my my
01:05:06 My postmodern art like act would be to go to high schools and middle schools
01:05:11 And hand out cards to all the boys and the cards just has plain text saying
01:05:16 The reason why girls don't want to have sex with you despite being just as wired for sex as you
01:05:21 Is that they're very very insecure about their vaginas and how they smell
01:05:26 Scratch this spot to get a vagina smell accustom yourself to it and make yourself comfortable with it and you will have sex
01:05:33 What the fuck?
01:05:34 What the fuck's wrong with you? What the fuck is wrong with you?
01:05:38 How could you get a
01:05:41 We gotta keep the body in population up if we want to have fucking health care, right?
01:05:45 I hear yes. Okay. Yay
01:05:47 It all comes back to health
01:05:49 It's all about the health care
01:05:53 Scratch and sniff vagina smell
01:05:55 Yeah, that's
01:05:57 This is a okay. This is a loaded ones
01:05:59 I don't really want to get into the political issue of it
01:06:01 but like for like mattress girl if you remember mattress girl and
01:06:05 We can put put aside whether or not everything she said was true or like anything about it
01:06:09 But the fact that the art piece was her carrying around a mattress
01:06:14 Around her school and this was the art piece like okay to be fair
01:06:19 I understand that like yes, this will get people talking at her school
01:06:22 They will say what's the deal with the fucking mattress. Um
01:06:26 You know, I guess I don't know anything more to say about it. I've seen I've seen an artist
01:06:30 Which I don't want to do who had a giant block of eyes very insightful point
01:06:33 And he would go to me
01:06:34 He went to New York with a giant block of ice and he would just push the ice all down the street
01:06:39 And he had a guy following him like like a block
01:06:42 Like a big block of ice that you would like
01:06:44 Contain like a fishing fish and whatever in the market
01:06:48 And he would just push it until it melted and the the point of the art piece was to
01:06:53 To show how such a strange thing was happening
01:06:56 But nobody would ever pay attention and nobody did
01:06:59 Nobody even looked up at all at him
01:07:01 That reminds me of this uh, there's this one like tv show
01:07:05 This is one like low budget tv show on one of those low budget channels about human psychology
01:07:09 One of those like hey, it's like a human psychology show for 11 year olds, right?
01:07:13 But they go to a mall and they get some uh, you know, like the fluffy like theater railing you use to make queuing lines
01:07:20 Right, they put it in the middle of the of the mall and they put a sign that says get in this line
01:07:26 Like for no particular reason. He doesn't say for no reason
01:07:29 But it doesn't say what the reason is right and they do they put the queuing line there and it leads to nothing
01:07:34 And oh, yeah, yeah, the sign just says the line starts here not explaining what the line is for and they film this from above
01:07:41 And the line goes for hours and no one gets in so they send in one of their guys
01:07:46 An actor to go into the line to stand there, right?
01:07:49 So he stands there looking confident like he's ready for the fucking line, right? He stands there for a full half an hour
01:07:56 When finally this one guy who seems kind of bored. He's like, huh?
01:08:00 So he gets in the line and the moment that there are two people in the line the line suddenly explodes
01:08:08 So it was a test in human psychology if no one's in the line. No one's getting one guy. That's good stuff
01:08:14 There's one guy in the line
01:08:15 Some outliers will try it and once there's two people in the line the line fills up like crazy
01:08:20 And so then they just sort of like had the first guy who was an actor
01:08:23 He just started walking and everyone just started following him, right?
01:08:27 And they they led them all throughout the mall eventually jumping over like stupid obstacles
01:08:31 Like jumping over like a little stick or whatever or going in a circle doing jumping jacks and everyone fucking participated
01:08:37 Yeah, but okay at some point the people in the line must have been like what the fuck's happened
01:08:41 Like like I'm sure I think some point it changed from like I'm just bored and gonna wait in this line
01:08:47 Just like it must have been amusing to them on some level, right?
01:08:51 When it got increasing things increasingly bizarre
01:08:55 Within every human's mind, I think is this two competing things of like independent free thought basically and like are just kind of
01:09:03 Relaxing ourselves into just like going with what the crowd is doing. I think those are like two
01:09:08 Primal forces that kind of jump. I heard the saying that like
01:09:12 An individual is intelligent a crowd is dumb something like that
01:09:16 Sure
01:09:17 What interested me about what divu said there was like he was explaining that and he said it was like
01:09:22 A study in psychology rather than an art piece and I think that at some point the line blur is there like what what?
01:09:30 What is a study of psychology? What is that? Can we define this?
01:09:36 Well, why don't we head over to our friends on urbandictionary.com?
01:09:39 Why don't we head over to forum.becomealivinggod.com?
01:09:44 Let me just read by the way for fun
01:09:49 Did you make?
01:09:50 Um, I'm chillin for it. I'm chillin for it. Let me just read the definition of psychology on urbandictionary
01:09:57 It's the practice of taking things we already know about people
01:10:01 And weighing it down with jargon until only the other people who understand it are psychologists
01:10:06 Art to me, you know, you know this guy hates
01:10:10 Jordan Pete very funny
01:10:12 Uh guys, I'm done. I'm spent. I've yeah. Well, I have one more thing to say
01:10:17 So, okay the the guy in the fucking ragu university video
01:10:21 He's all fucking like where did the centuries long quest for beauty and artistic and skillful perfection
01:10:30 Like go away like what happened to it, right?
01:10:33 He said it didn't just die out. It was pushed out
01:10:36 You know by the by the fucking like hipsters and shit in the early 20th century, right? Here's the thing now
01:10:41 That's yet another thing about that video that's fucking retarded
01:10:44 It wasn't like one day some dudes decided to change the face of art and it was all their fucking fall
01:10:52 And they could have shown up in the 19th century or the 15th century or the 29th century
01:10:57 The fact that they showed up in the 20th century
01:11:00 Means a whole lot in the late 19th century because that's when film was taking off and photography was taking off
01:11:06 It was fucking inevitably going to become like static art
01:11:11 Paintings and sculpting was always going to become a bunch of hipster bullshit because of film because film is where we put
01:11:20 Our highest priority of beauty the most effort the most skill and often that is highly diluted like when we think of hollywood movies
01:11:27 It's you know, it's a mass produced
01:11:29 You know machine, but when you think when you think about the directors out there whose films are extremely artful
01:11:36 It's like this is the height of our quest for beauty and overt obvious depth
01:11:42 Now right like animation and film and video games even are like the mediums where we're putting our emphasis there
01:11:48 So painting and sculpting they're sort of like left behind as like mediums that cannot touch people as
01:11:55 Deeply in nine times out of ten because there's not as many mediums. So that's why they become so weird
01:12:00 I don't think it's necessarily that I think the fact that
01:12:04 You can now watch movies at home, but arts you still have to go to a gallery
01:12:09 That you used to have to go to a cinema to see a film
01:12:13 And now you don't need to so now it's like less of an art form in the sense that you go out to see it
01:12:19 Like a theater or a play or whatever and and more that you can it's a it's a consumable product that people
01:12:25 you know go through in their own time wherever and whenever they like and
01:12:31 I think
01:12:32 I think the the the art is like um, you know in galleries and sculptures and paintings are still like
01:12:39 The same a level of like
01:12:41 You know artistic fulfillment you can get from it. It's just you have to go to the place where it is
01:12:47 And for a lot of people that just isn't worth the time
01:12:49 But the thing that it evokes is like the feeling of going to a place
01:12:54 Like you go to a nice countryside and you take in the environment
01:12:58 You see the nice blue sky and the trees and the stuff and it sounds and feels really nice and that
01:13:04 You cut I wouldn't say it's art because that's stupid
01:13:06 No one should say that but like that's the feeling that a painting of a beautiful landscape is supposed to invoke in use
01:13:13 To remind you of what it feels like to see and be in a place like that. Oh, yeah
01:13:18 I remember one time in the chat we were talking about what are our favorite aesthetics and you were like
01:13:22 I remember you hit bill you were like, oh my favorite aesthetics is this and this or like uh
01:13:26 Some the point is you listed a bunch of like regular aesthetics and then you one of your aesthetics was
01:13:31 Being in an abandoned 12th century castle. Yes. I love that. I love castles that they're my favorite art piece
01:13:38 By mankind. They're better than propaganda. I prefer nature. Yeah, you can definitely argue that. Well, uh, here's what I want to say about
01:13:46 Davoo's point
01:13:47 So so to what that guy was saying about how like it was intentionally made so that we're deviating from these objective standards of beauty and stuff
01:13:55 So I am agnostic about if there is some grand marxist conspiracy to like destroy the west
01:14:01 I I do not know, uh, whether that's true or not. So I'm putting that aside
01:14:05 But what I will say is to to his point to his point of how we are in fact deviating from these beauty standards
01:14:11 Um, I want to give him as much credit as possible. He may or may not have intended this but like I'm reading this into it. Anyway, it's like
01:14:19 We definitely are
01:14:21 Getting further away on in the art scene at the very least from objective standards
01:14:25 And as Davoo was saying it may in fact have been inevitable
01:14:28 But just because it's inevitable it may also be inevitably
01:14:33 Destructive to the human race that that's happening that is like it's possible that christianity for example
01:14:39 Despite being not true would just be a useful thing to keep humans in line so that we don't kill ourselves
01:14:45 It's possible. Hold on. I think we I think this is a promo for an upcoming episode
01:14:49 I think me and you Nate would be most wanting to do
01:14:52 Which would be called wake of phobia, which is what some right wing
01:14:56 writers throughout the decades have
01:14:59 It basically it basically means fear of the familiar fear of the home
01:15:03 But some right wing writers have co-opted that term to mean the opposite of xenophobia
01:15:08 Sort of like whenever someone hears about a law that exists in the uk and they're like
01:15:15 We should have that law in america too, but america's too stupid to have it
01:15:18 Like how american feminists like uh are totally okay with like women being enslaved in saudi arabia
01:15:24 Well, they're not okay with it, but like the fact that they're their priorities
01:15:27 Yeah, like i mean i remember one time being in the car with like this girl
01:15:29 This chick who was just like constantly be like oh man america sure sucks for this reason
01:15:33 Oh, they're you could just passively mention something different about some other country and they're like, oh, that's so much better than is in america
01:15:41 Yeah, right and i think i think it's a natural
01:15:45 A natural result of becoming
01:15:47 The the most powerful opulent nation that it starts to destroy itself from within by people who felt like they didn't do
01:15:53 Anything to earn this opulence feel guilty about it and take it out in this manner. So yeah, this should be a
01:15:58 I'll add wake of phobia to the topics list. We'll do this some other time
01:16:02 Okay, and we will title that episode we hate white people
01:16:06 That's what i am beautiful
01:16:09 I feel like like um
01:16:11 with like youtube videos and and and and uh like media that we consume at home or wherever
01:16:17 Even music to a degree, but music still has festivals which are big and live performances
01:16:22 but like getting out of the house and going to see art is
01:16:27 Dying out a little bit at a time cinemas are now like not as big as they used to be and they need to be like
01:16:33 Luxury in order to make any money at all
01:16:35 um
01:16:36 And I feel like with you know the young people they stay at home. They don't do anything
01:16:41 They they they can get everything they ever wanted through the internet and they can get the internet everywhere
01:16:46 so like
01:16:47 In this time and this day in this age
01:16:50 Uh art pieces that you have to go and see are more valuable than ever
01:16:55 But nobody wants to go to them and I understand because art galleries are stuffy and
01:16:59 And some of them you have to pay to get in and whatever and and you know not you're not going to guarantee to find as much as you could get
01:17:06 Just googling stuff. So what but but what I think
01:17:10 What I think is that the reason
01:17:13 Well, I think the greatest
01:17:16 piece of art in the modern age
01:17:18 For this reason
01:17:20 This is no this bad gas is pokemon go
01:17:26 Now we're talking now because it combines video games with
01:17:29 Being a real human in the real world and going to places and having experiences and connecting with people in a way
01:17:35 That no other thing that you can do now
01:17:38 Really allows you to do
01:17:39 Speaking of which I've really enjoyed the gifts that you've been sending me from your local poke stops
01:17:44 I've I've I've liked having you send gifts and then me google searching what the poke stop was that you send it from
01:17:51 Be able to see where you are. That's cool. What's what was this about gifts?
01:17:54 Wait, what is this the thing in that you can trade? Yeah, mage. I I will send you a gift
01:18:00 I think I'm gonna add people to your friends list now that i'm back in boston
01:18:03 I gotta fucking get on the go train. I gotta go hard. Dude. I got it. I got it downloaded. I got it downloaded. I'm going
01:18:09 I'm going I will definitely say it is super it is supremely art
01:18:12 I remember back to the early 2000s in some kids highly decked up decorated blue room
01:18:18 Him showing me all of his pokemon cards and he's like at the same age as me and then warp to
01:18:24 14 years later being at a gazebo in virginia beach
01:18:28 Seeing people huddled around playing pokemon go including a like 60-something year old woman with oxygen hooked up to her fucking nose
01:18:35 I remember that gazebo. I remember that gazebo
01:18:39 Yeah, the the people that you meet will play in pokemon go are mothers their construction workers
01:18:49 They're all the same they are all the things that you want to see inside in this great art piece we call pokemon go
01:18:56 Oh, you did
01:18:59 I have I actually I have two things I need to say before we close out
01:19:03 First is to kind of go all the way back to beginning talking about like, you know postmodernism versus classical art like the prager you video
01:19:10 um
01:19:11 I feel like those are like two ends of a spectrum of like art
01:19:16 Uh, like like you have postmodernism, which I can appreciate the idea or like people can appreciate the idea
01:19:21 But the execution is kind of basic, but on the other hand you have the classical art where like the execution is masterfully done
01:19:27 But the the subject matter is very basic just like the bible, you know or just like yeah a portrait
01:19:33 So like there's like this middle ground that I find the most appreciative is where you have
01:19:38 skillful execution and an interesting idea and that's like
01:19:41 The art I like because like as much as I can appreciate the uh the time and energy put in like a classical painting
01:19:46 Like I don't really not really huge fan of that either because like I'm like, okay
01:19:50 Right. Yeah, that's why that perfect middle ground the perfect artistic medium is shown in manga shown in exactly
01:19:57 The greatest the greatest art medium. Oh, but speaking of that. Okay
01:20:00 I needed to the one last thing I wanted to get off my chest
01:20:04 Is the moment the moment that fucking uh, I hated the art world forever. Um
01:20:09 This is a bit of a bit of a story, but I'll wrap it up quickly
01:20:13 um
01:20:13 Back in like the early mid-2000s like if anyone who's doing art and like college or high school
01:20:19 You know that like there was like this big like if you were trying to draw like a cartoony style
01:20:23 Like your art teachers hated you like this was like a meme and like whether it was true or not
01:20:27 Like a good idea or not is irrelevant to what I'm about to say. Um, because like
01:20:32 I was drawing like cartoons and shit like that was what I was into
01:20:35 and I was like graduating high school going into college and like everybody gave me shit for it and
01:20:41 And it was it was fucking infuriating because like I was trying to like do like realistic art to like work on my portfolio and
01:20:47 Shit and everyone's like you should just do that. I'm like, uh, but it's gay. I don't like it. Um, but but but
01:20:53 I had like a portfolio and I went to uh,
01:20:56 Some bunch of schools and like they all said it was shit because like oh, we're fucking sick of anime get out of here
01:21:01 It's gay. We hate you go die. So like all right, whatever so so
01:21:06 Right off the bat fucking pissed off, but
01:21:09 I end up getting into a school and I go and whatever and like the entire time
01:21:12 It's like, okay, like I'm gonna do like the art stuff here
01:21:15 And I'm gonna do my cartoon shit off the clock because like that's that's a no-go zone
01:21:20 We can't make that happen
01:21:21 Whatever and I'm taking art history class and I fucking hate it and it's supremely disgusting
01:21:27 The the the culture around like sucking all these artists dicks and like like trying to like make all these things more complicated
01:21:34 More haughty than they actually are and I just find it infuriating and obnoxious, but then
01:21:39 2010 we get to talking about a new art movement that started called super flat
01:21:46 Oh, no
01:21:49 And I want to
01:21:54 And wikipedia super flat is a postmodern art movement which is influenced by manga and anime
01:22:02 all of a sudden
01:22:03 Now because it's a fucking art movement those same teachers who are like cartoons or gay are like look at this beautiful
01:22:10 Inspired art and I'm like you're fucking
01:22:13 Cuts
01:22:15 Wait, wait, but super flat is not just fucking anime art, right?
01:22:18 No, it's not just but the whole thing is that you look at these pieces. It's clearly inspired by that same aesthetic anime
01:22:24 Yeah, okay, and and and and so it's no it's it's it's I like the aesthetic
01:22:30 It's not like great and therefore
01:22:32 I'm looking up super flat art is usually great. Take a look at this one right here
01:22:36 Look at this is a little bit of anime. I think in my uh, yeah, that might be a little anime in it
01:22:42 That might be just a bit anime
01:22:44 So so it's just like
01:22:46 My point is that this is why I hate the art scene because it's like and until it's like in the art scene
01:22:52 It's disgusting, but as soon as all of these other people are like, oh, well, this is art. I guess now it's okay
01:22:57 That is bullshit when I hate when we when we talk about these arbitrary
01:23:01 Reputations that people get like I mean sometimes it's just because like they're a cunt and people relate to it
01:23:06 But sometimes it's because it's someone who comes along with a style that a lot of people can do or other people can do
01:23:12 But this one guy
01:23:14 Has the nerve and or charisma to shove it down everyone's face until they're forced to accept it as the new hotness
01:23:21 Similarly to what a couple of analysts did on youtube until eventually analysis became the new review
01:23:27 Even though it used to be beaten down as overanalyzing before that point
01:23:30 I don't really get super. I mean, okay
01:23:33 Like it's not like I don't think that it looks good necessarily like like these just kind of like
01:23:38 sprawling like series of like flat images and like a white void like I I get it
01:23:43 Uh, I don't know seems pretty like
01:23:46 Seems a little uh, what's the word not an frank lisa frank. That's the one
01:23:52 Yeah
01:23:55 All the time I I'm definitely feeling some and frank
01:24:03 Is that a whale lord statue, uh, I google super flat and a three dimensional thing came up and I was like, that's not
01:24:10 Well, that's just that's not good. That's not that's not well
01:24:15 Well, tom funny thing you mentioned super flat because I actually learned that super flat myself just a few months ago
01:24:21 Well visiting but while visiting the fine arts museum in boston mason says god in my own in my own time
01:24:29 My own backyard my oppressor
01:24:32 Is on display
01:24:33 He there's an entire there was an entire section dedicated to him and at the museum. I realize that I absolutely
01:24:40 Adore the idea of museums and I don't mind paying to see museums
01:24:45 I just feel persecuted and I do not like all of the art that is in museums
01:24:51 I like the concept of them, but I hate them all the time
01:24:54 For instance, this is not the finance museum
01:24:56 But there's another museum in boston for art called the institute of contemporary art and when I went to there
01:25:01 There was a there was a an exhibit all on art created in the internet period and there's a lot of you know
01:25:07 Digital art and there's a lot of shit that would be recognizable to stuff like, you know, you and me
01:25:12 There wasn't like d.v. Narnship. There was a lot of like, you know, hip trendy
01:25:16 Means internet shit that commentated a lot of marin issues and that stuff. I absolutely
01:25:21 Adored I love that exhibit with all my heart and that was the funniest
01:25:24 I've ever had at any museum ever sadly. It's over now
01:25:27 I went to
01:25:29 A museum during a con because I had a comics class as an elective in college
01:25:33 And we went to a museum that just had comic art and they had
01:25:35 Like the original cover of my favorite cover of my favorite comic on display and I like knotted
01:25:42 Everywhere. I know it's great. So so I just I want to know because I've been trying to search for other similar
01:25:49 Institute of contemporary arts, but I can't find any in San Diego and I want to know why I want to bang on the clouds and ask God
01:25:57 Why why are museums gay and stuffy and dusty and bad because okay
01:26:02 I go I go to the the the museum of fine arts in San Diego and it's fine
01:26:07 And I like it and it's just all right and it has that faming pain that famous pain that I had my avatar for a while
01:26:12 Where the guy's holding his finger up to his head and he looks like he's thinking real hard
01:26:15 And it was the thinker that's embossed for my inclusion of it and not for the ponder
01:26:20 Oh
01:26:24 The the ponder yeah the yeah that guy
01:26:27 Uh, it's fine. Oh, but where are the fucking anime? Where's the super flat? Where's the colors?
01:26:33 Where are the memes?
01:26:36 That's correct. That's what it comes down to. You should come to london and we can go to like a gallery hop
01:26:42 I would absolutely love to do that. Okay. I can't I cannot stress it enough going to the finance museum seeing the tukashi exhibit
01:26:48 and seeing specifically
01:26:50 Uh, this is the full title of the pain by the way dragon in the clouds red mutation the version
01:26:55 I painted when my professor told me to paint something myself for once by tukashi
01:27:00 That's uh, one of my favorite frames of all time
01:27:02 Fucking great and uh going to the institute of contemporary art seen all the internet
01:27:06 I'm gonna link you. I'm gonna have to get some of this shit and I'll put in the show notes
01:27:09 But it's absolutely incredible the shit I saw there. I took a lot of videos. Uh, it was beautiful
01:27:13 I just I just this is all just a call to arms museums
01:27:17 Please house and patronize modern contemporary art from the internet and you know just general contemporary stuff
01:27:25 I like renaissance paintings. I just want more contemporary and downed earth casual shit and stylistic
01:27:31 Drawings that's what I would love to have like a vlog of of of uh hippo and munchie going on a london art hop
01:27:37 Actually, that reminds me back in me and digi's trip to atlanta me and ben
01:27:42 We were we were walking down that one like hipster street and we just started like rating every painting and mural
01:27:48 We saw out of five and then sometimes we said out of seven and out of 12 sometimes
01:27:52 And we just thought this should be a show of just the two of us go to like anything and rate the aesthetics of everything ever
01:28:00 Davoo, you and I have such different have like such different uh aesthetics
01:28:06 Consideration we have just have we just value. I think we value very different things. So I think that would be interesting
01:28:11 right
01:28:12 Yeah, so well next next time make it so team make it so
01:28:18 Okay, and with that I think it's finally time to delete this pie. Yeah
01:28:23 All right. This has all been a postmodern experiment in art that no one will ever see we actually wasn't we weren't recording any of this
01:28:30 Postmodern way to do a podcast is just have a fucking link to a zip file of all of the audacity projects
01:28:36 And not even converted to wabs yet, right?
01:28:39 I think it's even most partners to send a screenshot of all the audio files in a folder and not give them access to it
01:28:46 Yeah
01:28:47 Oh, oh, oh, okay
01:28:49 Uh, okay, okay, my favorite thing that I this is the last thing I promise the last thing the best thing
01:28:54 I saw that instrued contemporary art, which I don't remember the name of which I think it's called my best thing
01:28:59 But it was this like like like like multi series episodic
01:29:04 Adventure, I would say recreate in some sort of like text-to-speech and like like go anime
01:29:09 But 3d miles a little like roblox. It was some sort of like like like put directly into that to make these
01:29:17 Text-to-speech robot speak things and it was a conversation that happened in real life
01:29:22 Where an art teacher who was a female went on like porn sites
01:29:26 Or or more accurately like like omegle chat roulette sites and had like philosophical insights with a horny
01:29:32 Italian man with his dick out the entire time. Wow, and it was cool as fucking hell
01:29:38 It was great. I think it's called my best thing 2011. I'm not sure though. Um
01:29:43 That's great. I love it. I voted good shit
01:29:47 The main segment of this episode's audio dialogue was
01:29:52 Significantly edited and spaced out to the effect that you could generally hear what everyone has to say
01:30:00 People who try to butt in but don't get an actual sentence in are simply muted
01:30:05 they're their failed sentences aborted and deleted from the timeline and times where
01:30:11 Three or four different people say something at once are actually spaced out to create sort of an artificial comedic timing
01:30:18 I only did that for everything in the episode up to this point now that we're in the questions and fan stuff
01:30:27 That's all gonna be much more freeform with much less editing just removing some of the noise not changing the timing of anything
01:30:34 I guess let us know if you can notice and appreciate and value
01:30:39 The difference because I'm interested in seeing how much better podcasts can be with this added effort
01:30:47 But I'm not sure if its market value will result in a net profit
01:30:52 All right
01:30:53 Guys, let's get down to it here
01:30:55 We got a couple of things to talk about real quick
01:30:57 As we as we recap the events since last week's episode number one on the agenda
01:31:02 Let's talk about how radcon 3 arena iRL came out and it was a fucking triumph. Oh, yeah, and it was incredible
01:31:10 Everyone loves it
01:31:11 It was truly decadence truly delectable
01:31:14 Uh, we had doubters out there. We proved them all wrong. There were doubters and now they are uh
01:31:21 Down syndromeers. That's what they that's what happened to them. The doubters are
01:31:26 Doubters
01:31:32 That's you know, that would have been good that would have been good
01:31:34 Uh, I don't know. I guess I just wanted to say that that was great
01:31:37 Go watch it if you haven't already uh show notes. Watch the video. It's also like the last video on the channel
01:31:44 It's great. Give edit it. It's incredible. I haven't been in the last couple episodes
01:31:48 I don't know what's happening in the pcp sphere of influence
01:31:51 But I know that the childhood episode has gone up which I was on and in which mage was some sort of gang warlord leader
01:31:58 In the streets of south africa essentially
01:32:01 That's that is what's happening now mage's role is actually
01:32:04 We we continue that meme in the fighting episode mage is now the violent violence. That is her name
01:32:09 Mage denies that she was the leader of the violent violence, but we think I just think she's trying to escape her war crimes
01:32:15 But she needs to pay for what she's done. That sounds like something that the violent violence would say
01:32:22 Yeah
01:32:23 The violent violence like
01:32:25 Addition to the canon is the best thing the pcp and its fandom has produced
01:32:31 final
01:32:32 Question final question. Have you ever seen mage and the violent violence in the same place at the same time?
01:32:38 No proof positive. There we go. That if something is proven, then it's true
01:32:47 If two things are both said then it's correct
01:32:59 All right, well, I don't I have nothing else to say about that. So let's just
01:33:02 I think yeah, I think we've exhausted yeah about the previous I am exhausted episode. I have some things to say
01:33:09 Oh, okay. Yeah a lot of people all not all the people several people mentioned the little tension we had
01:33:15 um
01:33:16 And I I was sort of like somewhat indecisive but disagreeing with you
01:33:20 But now I can firmly say I completely disagree with you after reading the comments. I I saw I saw the error in your ways
01:33:29 I forget what was the argument?
01:33:32 Should be allowed to
01:33:34 Refuse service to people
01:33:36 Yeah, that's right. I I I am for freedom of speech and freedom of expression, but I'm also for
01:33:43 I'm also for
01:33:45 um equal opportunity
01:33:47 And like we were only focusing. Well, you're also
01:33:51 Aren't you saying I mean a specific case was you can't compel people to do something if they don't choose to but you're arguing against that
01:33:58 No, I'm I don't understand what's being argued here. It wasn't on the last day. All right. We were talking about um, yeah, it's
01:34:04 You know, this is a fighting episode, by the way, very weird
01:34:08 I missed but oh well
01:34:12 Yeah, I I'd love to say about fine
01:34:14 There's the possibility of like a town
01:34:17 Where the there's just one walmart and it for some reason denies service to uh, everyone in the town
01:34:23 And we were we were arguing like well, they are a company and they can choose to deny service to whoever they like
01:34:30 Uh, but should the government force them to sell things?
01:34:33 Oh, well on my position on this I can explain in 30 seconds is that in this reality?
01:34:39 Yes, because we live in a world where this whole dream of freedom to choose what you want
01:34:44 Is compromised in a million ways anyway
01:34:46 Like yeah, there's a thousand laws that force companies to like have to conform to things that they shouldn't have to in a free country
01:34:52 But there's a million laws forcing employees and consumers to conform to a bunch of things that they shouldn't have to do in a free country
01:34:59 And if you only give the additional free if you only give back freedoms to companies
01:35:03 You better at least be giving the same amount of freedoms back to consumers and workers, right the fucking
01:35:09 The fucking structure of oppression and compromises on freedom in this culture is like a jenga statue
01:35:14 And if you just take apart pieces of it haphazardly, it's gonna it's gonna crash
01:35:19 I
01:35:22 Couldn't tell what side you're on based on that good very fucking good
01:35:27 You can't just decide what side I'm on you have to actually listen to me
01:35:30 Basically what I want to say you can completely
01:35:33 Compromise a person's livelihood because we were talking mostly about walmart
01:35:37 But what about like public services like a bus can get you well that those are public those are government though
01:35:42 That's a totally different situation kind of you know like no no no no no no no no no no completely untrue
01:35:48 That is the opposite of
01:35:50 It's a little it's a little hard to explain what it like public services. I think well here's the thing
01:35:54 Here's a thing where it actually gets and electricity and I think a better example than something like walmart
01:36:00 The company would be something like google or the internet because that's like those are those are companies that are okay
01:36:06 We should be clear right now
01:36:08 These things are all publicly owned if you want to argue that they are effectively utilities and they should be treated that way legally
01:36:14 Then fair enough, but that is not how they are right now
01:36:17 Right should so you know it's relevant. It's relevant right and that's my point like should they be regulated as such
01:36:23 I don't want to prolong this debate. I'm just saying that like I it's too late mage
01:36:28 It's part two it's happening right now
01:36:30 I wanted to make a harsh statement that I
01:36:33 But straight up mage straight up mage
01:36:34 If you if if a guy if you walk in and you want to get gay married and you walk into a cake shop
01:36:40 As the as the as the thing goes and the guy says like sorry, but I don't make cakes for gay people
01:36:44 Uh, like I mean it's against my religion. I think it's wrong. I have a sincere religious belief
01:36:48 You think he should have to make that cake. Are you arguing for that? I said I said like all right like I said
01:36:54 You're saying large corporations, right? Yeah. Yeah, basically that like I don't why does that matter? Why is it?
01:37:00 There's a difference, but I said I don't want to like prolong this conversation. I just like
01:37:05 Oh, I don't want to have to defend my beliefs. I just want to say them and now
01:37:10 So I did say like there's a difference like you know, it's just a mom-and-pop shop
01:37:13 It's just it just it's just that one shop in one area. No one really cares like if it goes under or not
01:37:19 It's not gonna affect the economy or the people's livelihood or whatever
01:37:22 But like if walmart all all of walmart decides to not sell to a certain demographic of people
01:37:28 Well, that's gonna like screw stuff up like for instance where I live
01:37:31 There's only like one as the store in the whole region and otherwise I'd have to like maybe like
01:37:37 I don't know take a bus to a different town to get like food
01:37:40 And what's really convenient about asda is that it's a 24 seven asda
01:37:45 So if at midnight I I suddenly realize oh, I'm out of food because my sleep schedule is awful
01:37:50 I can just go to house and buy some food and but like
01:37:54 I wouldn't be able to do that if they decide to not sell to lefie unions anymore, you know, so
01:37:59 So so the absolute rebuttal to that would be oh
01:38:02 So people have to be controlled by law because they're so successful like um, oh, oh specifically
01:38:08 There's this one uh documentary called fathead, which is a response to supersize me that brings up
01:38:13 It it depends on it doesn't say mcdonalds is a good company
01:38:16 But it sort of rebutts a lot of the complaints one of the criticisms of mcdonalds back when they had played places prominently
01:38:23 They would argue that it's the it's manipulating children and families into eating unhealthy food and giving them money because they have
01:38:29 A you know recreational activity for kids and some kids don't have access to recreational activities otherwise
01:38:35 So it's manipulating their it's exploiting their needs to which the the fathead documentary says well
01:38:41 The federal government didn't give those kids a play place
01:38:44 The local government didn't give those kids a playground
01:38:47 Ronald mcdonalds did and ronald mcdonald is to be seen as evil for being the only one who gave them one, right?
01:38:53 So you can say similarly like oh because walmart is successful
01:38:57 It now has to get fucked over it's similar just it's similar to like oh this happens in fucking
01:39:02 Right well this happens in iron man two basically where the government's like, you know, tony stark
01:39:06 You've made such good inventions that you don't any longer gets to own them, right?
01:39:11 Now my rebuttal to that would be i get to to a degree
01:39:14 What if an inventor just invents a doomsday weapon like okay, right now we can have a conversation which effectively is what tony stark
01:39:21 Is not so so my feeling on that is because I very much feel in my in
01:39:25 Let's admit the philosophy of iron. Yeah in my yeah
01:39:28 The philosophy of tony stark 15 minute video, right? So
01:39:32 My fucking I feel the libertarianism in my very veins
01:39:36 I feel that like, you know, like you shouldn't be penalized for obtaining power and success
01:39:41 But then I have to remember, you know, there's a reason why we came up with this whole freedom and uh like free economy and capitalism and
01:39:49 And freedom from the government in the first place, right? It was because
01:39:53 governments
01:39:55 Also got too successful and powerful like we didn't even really have this whole like freedom
01:40:00 Thing be a thing until around a certain point of colonialism when governments became so big and bloated that they started becoming a real obvious problem
01:40:09 And we were able to identify how we could do things better and at this point the concept of the corporation is becoming very similar
01:40:16 They're becoming these international fucking nations unto themselves often with more gdp
01:40:21 So like, you know, maybe it's time to update our philosophy on what's right and wrong because 500 years ago
01:40:27 Nobody probably thought that it like the idea of a nation telling you what to do was wrong
01:40:31 We had to invent that idea, right?
01:40:33 And it was it's not has nothing to do with like the fact that one type of entity makes laws and the other type of entity makes profits
01:40:40 It all comes down to one thing
01:40:42 Control being conglomerated in a couple of people who have the power and the ability to to control other people
01:40:52 Yeah, yep, generally. I agree. That's it's not it's not as black and white as either of us. We're saying
01:41:00 And I'm aware of that too
01:41:05 Uh on fighting one time I was six and in like
01:41:10 Well not six. I'm more like it was eight and I was in the fourth grade
01:41:14 And uh some high school junior tried to come up to me and fuck with me and I literally beat the shit out of him
01:41:22 I'm gonna say one time one time. No, no, no, no. We are not going into fighting. That was last episode. God damn it
01:41:28 This is not a rehash of the entire fucking fighting. I'm gonna show up to the episode if you want to be on it
01:41:33 All right, but that being said if you want to tell one thing
01:41:41 In my neighborhood it was like super lame and insecure and would be a huge whiny butt and I'd make fun of him
01:41:46 But like not like a I don't think it too much of a bullying
01:41:48 We I would just point out how pathetic he's being and he took like military class and judo and shit
01:41:55 That was just wrestling and like, you know like okay you versus you okay now you versus you
01:42:00 So it was me versus him and I don't have any fighting skills or athleticism
01:42:03 I'm like five inches taller than him three years older than him
01:42:06 He just like pulls me over and like throws me like just suplexes me onto my back
01:42:09 And it didn't even hurt. It was on the grass, but I'm like
01:42:13 Okay, cool. You've turned your fucking like impotent rage into something something somewhat potent. Good job
01:42:18 But you did it you have some respect now
01:42:22 Okay, okay. All right. Well good. Nate you are you are an egg. You are like
01:42:27 You're you're an egg and you've got like a marker and you drew on the on the shell like angry eyes
01:42:32 You got this hard out of shell and you're like, yes, I'm very tough and and then as soon as anything happens to you
01:42:38 You're so soft. You're such a
01:42:42 I'm okay with it. No, no, I'm a hard boiled egg. I'm tough inside. I'm resilient as well
01:42:47 Yeah, nothing's nothing's harder and more and more resistant to damage than a hard boiled egg
01:42:53 Art people draw draw Nate as an egg. That's the new art thing. Yeah. All right. That sounds good. That sounds good. Uh
01:43:01 Yeah, I'll make you girl
01:43:07 Okay, funny side up
01:43:09 Our document tells us that the next section is the question section
01:43:13 It's a goddamn question
01:43:15 Are the corporation co
01:43:18 Policy mandates
01:43:22 Way to office skate responsibility, mr. Bestman. Well, listen to this one uh at suck on my big pee pee
01:43:36 All right, here we go prostate massage. Yes or no sure why not next
01:43:42 I'll take two
01:43:50 Well, uh, uh, there's a question here about i g tv. Do we want to go? Okay?
01:43:53 I want to just point out my my answer on prostate massages is that they are uncomfortable
01:43:58 But pretty relaxing if you're comfortable with the person doing it. Oh, well, there we go
01:44:08 Is that
01:44:13 Um
01:44:15 Okay, you know, I'm not going to read this question about i g tv because I think we're going to talk about that later on
01:44:19 Uh, or like next week or something. Okay that uh fucking questions bar. Who's got one? I'm going to go pull one up
01:44:25 What do you got for us?
01:44:28 Um, none of them are worthy. Why do we do this if there are no worthy questions?
01:44:32 Um, well that you know why it's because you guys told them that art was the subject
01:44:35 This is what you get this is what you get when you when you mentioned that the topic is going to be art
01:44:39 That all the questions are boring. Shit. We've already answered in the fucking episode
01:44:43 Oh
01:44:45 No, yeah, what what does this have to do with art modern?
01:44:53 They literally have postmodern sonic games remember that that weird one
01:44:59 That is a postmodern sonic game. Oh, shit. Yeah sonic dreams collection. Fuck
01:45:05 I like modern sonic you go in 3d
01:45:08 You go really fast. Well
01:45:11 I guess sonic mania is actually it is classic sonic by form
01:45:15 It is just the latest the latest one. Yes, you know, so that's this good. I liked it
01:45:21 Uh modern's uh martin sonic versus classic sonic is not interesting
01:45:24 But what is interesting is classic mickey mouse versus modern mickey mouse and I actually have a very hard line opinion with this
01:45:31 uh most okay
01:45:33 Classic mickey mouse actually had a revival recently in the form of the modern disney channel on youtube mickey mouse shorts
01:45:41 And everyone praises those because they are quite good
01:45:44 But I actually do not like the art style because I feel like it is disingenuous to pretend that mickey mouse is not
01:45:50 The modern mickey mouse and to go back on it is just jarred me
01:45:53 But I saw on toontown. I cannot find any photographic evidence of this
01:45:57 So you just have to pretend what I'm saying is true
01:46:00 But in toontown at disneyland. There is a there's a lineup of characters
01:46:05 There was a mural on a wall that depicts the gang mickey goofy donald
01:46:10 Pluto and danger dolin and they are all there and they are actually a combination of the colors of modern
01:46:18 Uh, the modern incarnation of the character
01:46:20 But with the designs of the previous ones except the skin tone the skin that's like that's like in
01:46:27 White so they just are white and that is the best that is the best interpretation
01:46:31 Final mix how sore gets a new form called the uh limit form
01:46:35 Which is when he gets a cool color scheme from kingdom hearts one
01:46:38 It was awesome thinking of kingdom hearts too. Remember how mickey looks like fucking shit
01:46:45 Here's here's my posh that right for metal gear solid right metal gear solid one is
01:46:50 Modern metal gear solid metal gear solid two is postmodern mgs postmodern and mgs three
01:46:57 Is classic mgs. It's it just like did it in the opposite timeline or reverse order
01:47:02 Metal gear solid two is proof that postmodern art is not all bad or anything. It is uh, like the best game ever made
01:47:07 A classic postmodern it should be a meme that you can apply to everything
01:47:12 Yes, yes, absolutely. This question by the way about modern or classic sounding was from j hawk dx
01:47:16 Just just just what he really needs the the exposure
01:47:20 I know right guys. Who what's mickey? Do you like better?
01:47:23 I don't like
01:47:26 It's gotta be
01:47:29 No, no, no when you say classic beam boat willy. I'm talking steam boat willy
01:47:33 The mickey that did not have the hairline, but it had the eyes
01:47:37 giant eyes like this like like like fucking stony interesting a comparison
01:47:43 Look look at this straight up rat. He looks great. He looks sick. I like he's got pac-mans
01:47:49 No, no, I'm not saying the pupils. I'm saying look. Yeah. Yeah. He's got the sonic
01:47:53 One eye with two pupils thing going on. Is that what you're talking about now? I get it now. I understand where sonic comes from
01:48:01 Yeah, by the way, uh, wait, there was another question here. What the fuck did it go?
01:48:04 Uh, it was something about shit whose question was that wait. I got it
01:48:09 Where the fuck did it go?
01:48:11 Hashtag up with victor. There it is. Why is the group piss the greatest example of modern art in human history?
01:48:16 Let's just dissect the art that is the group piss. Uh, it was good. That's all I have to say. Yeah, that's it
01:48:24 It was my invention
01:48:27 Actually, as we know the curation is the ultimate form of art and it was literally my idea to film it
01:48:31 Therefore I deserve 100 of the credit for doing so disgusting get banned. You are banned from the pcp
01:48:40 That's my favorite part of the group piss is that we all created our own art pieces in the snow
01:48:47 That's true. That's true. It's like a time these are the rest of these questions
01:48:51 These are all bad. These are all bad questions
01:48:56 Okay, if you want to buy a yellow poon, do you guys think becoming mainstream is inherently damaging to the original vision of a product?
01:49:05 Maybe not inherent, you know, it's not inherent, you know, it's art
01:49:08 You know, it's arch that mage just had to read the words yellow poon, uh unironically and is
01:49:15 Uh, you know, that's just what what a world what a world? Yeah, there it is. That's gonna come back to haunt you someday
01:49:25 What was the other question? Hold on actually
01:49:28 I do want to say like I forgot to answer that one, right?
01:49:31 I mean there is a cracked article like six artists who became famous after they sold out, right?
01:49:36 Like it was like became good including the Beatles
01:49:39 They originally were much more punk before they were reigned in for having identical hairstyles and stuff
01:49:44 And also I think the ultimate example is that Michelangelo
01:49:48 Didn't want to paint he preferred sculpting and the church kept roping it back in to keep painting. He's like fine
01:49:55 I'll paint your goddamn ceiling
01:49:57 So there you go. I what if my art form is a crewing currency?
01:50:02 What if that is my art?
01:50:06 I think I have to draw the line on what's hard at some point
01:50:09 I think like
01:50:10 when once they are popular
01:50:13 The greatest artists of all time George Soros
01:50:16 I think when you're popular there's a pressure to keep doing what you're doing and less experimenting so like
01:50:21 You could potentially but it depends on how well you do under pressure and like you have to balance the pressure and your own vision
01:50:30 That's true. You have to make sure that when you get popular you're getting popular doing something you actually want to do for a long time
01:50:36 If you get popular doing something you hate you're fucked
01:50:38 This guy may be talking from the lens of like a series of like video games like
01:50:44 The first one was small, but then it gets big and and it changes as it goes along
01:50:49 Then they changed like like because like there's no way the original vision of a part of like if a project
01:50:55 Sorry, um exists
01:50:58 And and then it becomes mainstream. It hasn't changed at all. It's just like people's perception of it
01:51:03 and I and to
01:51:05 And to tom's point like he got popular, you know doing like the pony videos that he from his own words hated doing
01:51:11 So like that's no fucking good. Uh, you know, that's not gonna last and uh, and it didn't so there you go the second question
01:51:21 Tom
01:51:23 Fuck sometimes you can really trigger 2013 memories in me, man
01:51:29 Um, I got nothing else to say about anything. Oh, major. What's your other question?
01:51:33 Uh, uh
01:51:36 Bitter for bitter bitter thorn
01:51:38 Yeah, if you had to choose between being deaf or being blind for one month, which would you pick?
01:51:43 Oh for one month. Oh, all right. Oh, um, that's a softball version of this question. Yeah. Oh, I like this one much more
01:51:51 um
01:51:52 Well, uh, having been deaf kind of in one ear for more than a month. I would definitely pick being blind
01:51:59 Because but what about the devil, you know, you know might be better than the devil
01:52:03 You don't know. I choose death for sure. Just because I I choose death. I just want to be dead for one
01:52:07 That's what I would go with
01:52:08 No, I'll choose blindness because um, I have musical talents that I can use to entertain myself and
01:52:15 People will do things for me because there's no way I could do things by myself
01:52:18 I mean, I choose I choose death for the exact same reason because if I was deaf, I could still draw
01:52:23 But if I was blind exactly same, right
01:52:25 Yeah, exactly. So like I would I would pick death because I could work on like
01:52:29 Yeah, I could work on shit for a while if I was blind. I couldn't I couldn't make a video if I was deaf
01:52:34 All right, I mean that's a tough one. That's a blessing in disguise. Fuck making videos. It's gay
01:52:38 True
01:52:38 I probably do use visual stuff significantly more than audio
01:52:42 But like i'm thinking of myself right now
01:52:44 I like when it comes to work like like vision would probably be the more important one
01:52:47 But when I when I think about like what would the world be like to me if I was either deaf or blind
01:52:52 And I'm just like what would make the work like I'm thinking about the nightmare of living through a month without this thing
01:52:57 That I've had my whole life and I think not having sight would be more bearable than not having audio
01:53:02 Yeah, I don't know what I mean. Yeah, because hippo you have a whole big song
01:53:05 I mean, hippo has a lot of he he makes the case that that being uh death would be more
01:53:10 I can't listen to my ASMR if I don't have hearing. I can't do it. I have I can't because your brain is accustomed to hearing
01:53:16 24 seven your eyes are accustomed to sometimes not seeing yeah being deaf
01:53:20 We take something away that you're much more used to I would agree
01:53:23 It's just I'd also like to get shit done in that month
01:53:25 Also, I've heard rush Limbaugh said that being deaf will piss people off because people can't relate to that fact
01:53:31 Like if you can't see it's easy for people to figure out what you're not getting
01:53:35 But if you can't hear especially if you can barely hear because you have implants
01:53:40 People are going to get pissed off that you can't ever like understand them properly
01:53:44 Well, I don't interact with anyone
01:53:46 So it's fine
01:53:48 Exactly, you know, I can test this but it's so fucked up the one acceptable form of bullying is against deaf people
01:53:54 One day. Well, we'll get over that that hurdle but for now
01:53:57 Fuck you if you're deaf. You can't even hear what I'm saying asshole. Oh, I see
01:54:02 Got him. I mean, that's that's funny
01:54:08 Um, no, I I love you. Uh, anyway
01:54:11 Wait, I think that's
01:54:14 I think we're no, I think we're done with questions
01:54:19 I don't I'm not even sure why you were directing that. Is that a me?
01:54:24 Uh, well
01:54:28 I I choose not to comment. All right, moving on moving on
01:54:32 It's time team for the pcp theme contest. Everybody's favorite part of the week. Oh, it's time to get right the fuck
01:54:39 How many have this right? Let me let me count real quick. Correct. Uh, sorry. What was that mage? Was that mage, right? Yeah
01:54:47 Oh, yeah, that's right. We're doing the fan art last. That's true. Which we we've got some good ones
01:54:50 Uh, let me just count real quick about one two three four five six seven entries. Oh my god
01:54:56 Boy, so let me all right. Let me see if this works in the easy way here. All right
01:54:59 Let me I'm just gonna fucking do the bot here. All right. Let's see. I'm gonna play right now
01:55:03 Let's see if this fucking thing works this one that I'm I'm linking is from at alien observer
01:55:08 All right, give me a sec to make sure this works play. All right. Here we go indeed
01:55:14 Oh, okay, that did not work. Let me let me fix this. I gotta get it from the actual thing
01:55:19 Nope, stop. Okay. Here we go. Here we go. Uh, and here we go
01:55:23 Play
01:55:30 I can barely hear it. Yeah
01:55:33 boring
01:55:34 Right right click on rhythm and turn up the volume
01:55:39 Whoa
01:55:46 Is this a real one or is this like ripped off from somebody it feels like two pro, you know
01:55:56 Uh, wait, wow, I heard me. Oh shit. Yeah, why are you talking? We can't hear you
01:56:05 Whoa
01:56:09 All right, this is pretty great. Yes, this is nuts
01:56:15 All right feel like well bear is now
01:56:18 Damn
01:56:20 all those game drops
01:56:22 Um
01:56:23 Dude, well, it's funny. I didn't know that anyone that fucking low register watched us. That's cool
01:56:30 Was that was that fucking blowing out the mic for all you guys too? Was that like clipped as fuck or was that just
01:56:37 No, no, that was
01:56:41 That is pretty impressive. But yeah, I'll listen to it again. We should I mean damn
01:56:46 Okay, we should because I could not understand anything
01:56:49 All right, that was like the most well produced one. I think we've got I feel like some rad con four like like montage
01:56:55 Of us like slow walking together could be said to that, you know, yeah
01:56:58 Oh, totally dude. Yeah, by the way, this is akazi on soundclad dude. It was fucking sick. I can tell you put a ton of work into it
01:57:06 Oh
01:57:09 As opposed to the
01:57:12 Um, I mean, I feel bad like I don't really think it works as like an intro or anything
01:57:17 But I really liked it
01:57:18 Ben that I could hear that fucking shit. Turn it down. God damn it
01:57:23 Yeah, Ben. Are you retarded? You can't play music out of your soaker when you're recording through your microphone
01:57:29 I think you have brain damage. This might be the best one yet
01:57:33 I supremely disagree, but I need to explain explain yourself explain. Yeah, well, I guess I I guess we haven't
01:57:40 It is like the best produce. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Let me let out my case. It's the best produced and it's specific
01:57:47 and it's high energy
01:57:49 I mean, you're not wrong. It's got like all the things that we want going for it
01:57:54 I gotta be honest. It's it's the vibe. It's the vibe that I yeah, no, like I don't think of it as high energy
01:58:01 I think of it more as like chill energy and I don't know. I'm not like against I'm not against chill
01:58:07 I'm not against chill by the way, but it doesn't have a melody like it doesn't have a catchy melody
01:58:13 Uh, and I also like I'm I'm any any theme is going to probably lose a bunch of points if it has vocals at all
01:58:19 I think something just
01:58:23 There's there's disagreement there's disagreement
01:58:25 Yeah, and then even within that category, you're almost certainly going to lose a lot of points for me as to
01:58:30 An intro would actually want to have if it's like
01:58:32 Like the lyrics are like explicitly referencing what the pcp is and name dropping it like I mean the worst is if it
01:58:40 That is good. I like that
01:58:42 I mean, I'm gonna respectfully
01:58:44 Like no, I totally get the idea that like a theme song references the people. I get it my tastes. I don't like that at all
01:58:50 I just heard like lyrics that I would prefer
01:58:54 All of my favorite theme songs are theme songs that don't directly say what the fuck the show is
01:58:59 But kind of abstractly say it like a cruel angel's thesis or the south park opening
01:59:03 Look, we're not okay, not gonna take you back to the past. This is me
01:59:09 I'm gonna say baby galeon
01:59:12 I am
01:59:14 It is too late it is too late in the game for us to like grab a song
01:59:22 That will become like indelibly linked to us and like an iconic piece of piece
01:59:26 I just agree. It's all about whether or not we lose it for you. We've already had 8 000 episodes without the song
01:59:32 Uh, I just don't I think it would be I think that's too much to hope for that
01:59:36 We find like the perfect okay, I don't I don't even care whatever the point
01:59:40 I mean like you know what it's it's kind of a cruel angel's thesis to say this but fucking pro crastinator by endless jess
01:59:47 Already basically did this like it's it's more in line with what I say what I'm saying here, right?
01:59:52 All right
01:59:54 Audience I just want to say in last episode. I just want to say audience don't
01:59:59 Bend once to discourage you from making a classic pcp theme. I say no if the song is great
02:00:05 It will become classic. I
02:00:07 Okay, um, I think that this is very very good and I like it a lot
02:00:12 But I kind of agree that the endless jess theme is very like yeah, that's that's us
02:00:19 So why not how about here's the thing take the melody from that and turn it into whatever thing you're doing
02:00:27 What I
02:00:29 Turn the melody of like don't
02:00:31 Don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't and make it more like that but like like faster and better and gooder
02:00:41 What's the point of that
02:00:45 Because it's it's the melody that people recognize
02:00:51 Yeah, we get the same melody with a better vibe maybe but I want to ask about what jessy thinks of that
02:01:02 He gave it to us. He can't indian give it away. Oh my god
02:01:04 I want to hear what people interpret us as and like
02:01:10 I mean, it's worth a shot. I mean, I I think this is way more fun having people just like don't you think it's a little
02:01:15 Late in the game to like start putting like stipulations on what is or isn't acceptable
02:01:23 It's just about what we like. Yeah, that's right. That's right
02:01:26 Every single time this section of the show comes up everyone debates if it's a good section or not if it has called
02:01:33 What are the rules?
02:01:36 I feel so bad for heroes like akazi who have slaved away and worked really hard on something and this is good
02:01:42 This is a clusterfuck of a
02:01:47 Really bullshit isn't it everyone shut up. We know we know this segment is a clusterfuck. We know okay. We know right
02:01:54 I like that. I
02:01:56 Nothing I have ever said
02:01:58 On this segment. Do I intend it to be a hard and fast rule in my mind?
02:02:01 Like it's all like suggestions, but like I will upvote whatever I think truly deserves it and it can break all the rules
02:02:08 I've stipulated. All right. He just here's what's going to happen. There will be a time
02:02:13 I think we established that the cutoff for the themes was I think the end of july. Is that what we said, tom?
02:02:17 Yeah, really? Oh, shit. This is doomed
02:02:19 So we said the july you say it's doomed, but we've already gotten good. Okay, whatever. It doesn't matter
02:02:23 The point is by the july 31st is the cutoff date at that time
02:02:27 We're done and we will go through all of these and we will pick our favorites and we'll decide what's best
02:02:33 And then we maybe we'll do a final round or something. We will figure it out
02:02:37 We'll just take it all covers and we're trying to we're this is us trying to do our best to give you
02:02:42 The tools to make something that we will accept. That's I mean, that's how I'm thinking about it
02:02:45 So, you know, fuck it. We got we got like six more to go akazi. Great job. This was awesome, uh, but band
02:02:54 All right, peace to be themed. All right, where the fuck is this, right?
02:02:58 Okay, this next one, uh, give me a second. This is from um, oh wait, this is a meme one
02:03:02 Okay, this one will not be accepted. Should I even play it? Should I even play it? Well, I don't know. I don't know until I've heard it
02:03:08 Well, I guess we better play it then and find out. All right, let's uh, here we go, uh, play
02:03:15 A go it's gonna be retarded
02:03:20 Wait a minute
02:03:24 Oh, wait a minute. It's it's okay. It is it is
02:03:28 Windows stop stop stop
02:03:30 Stop this needs to stop right now. Okay. Okay. Stop. Um, it is windows xp startup sound one million times ear rape warning
02:03:39 That's what that was. All right. I forgive me for what's going on. Yeah
02:03:43 Next I don't know why that was even the question
02:03:46 I I think there was put there's a meme and I should have known better. All right, so here we go. This is another one
02:03:51 All those years on fortune still can't see it coming
02:03:56 Okay, our next one is from a
02:03:58 Excelular or at cx
02:04:01 7001. All right, this is called uh, welcome to the pcp dimension
02:04:05 Here we go fucking play right now go
02:04:13 Oh wait, I think I have to oh, okay. Sorry. I have to skip you really you really forked it. Hang on. Hang on
02:04:18 Here we go. Come on. She shut up play
02:04:41 That's it. I want that to go on for longer. That was the intro to a theme
02:04:46 No, yeah, wasn't that used before somewhere? I thought it was no no no
02:04:50 I mean like it feels like the intro to a drop that doesn't happen, but I do
02:04:59 I would say it isn't really appropriate as what we want
02:05:01 But personally if I was in charge of a podcast, I would find that so fucking funny and how inappropriate it is
02:05:07 I would vote for it
02:05:08 Didn't you just get finished saying that a thing can break all the rules, but if you like it you'll still support it
02:05:12 Well, the hero for the fucking thing it breaks. That was one of the rules. That's what I'm saying
02:05:16 Dude, Ben. That's literally what I'm saying. I'm saying it's so fucking funny and how inappropriate it is. I'll totally use it
02:05:22 I would totally vote for it. I mean wait, but but it's just awesome guys. This is fucking awesome
02:05:27 And it would be great. I would be I would be I would be happy to have this as our
02:05:31 Enter to our podcast. Well, I don't think it fits the tone of our show, but I do like it. Yes, it does
02:05:37 Well, that's fine. Anyway, point is point is I'm still not super big on it because like what hippo said
02:05:43 I was expecting something more so like if just if this dude could expand it to where after that
02:05:47 It's like 30 seconds of like kick ass catchy techno
02:05:56 At the end of the vocals it kind of burst open into sort of a base drop and then that faded out
02:06:00 Hold on. Ben. That's the reason I know 30 seconds is too long. I know 30 seconds is too long
02:06:04 Here's the thing though 30 seconds that can then fade out to the podcast
02:06:09 You see right because it would be an approach it would be weird if it like cuts out all at once
02:06:13 And then we start talking you have it fade out as the talking begins and 30 seconds gives you enough leverage to use that
02:06:18 You'll probably almost never hear the full 30 seconds though
02:06:22 I mean, yeah, he's just saying to have like a buffer. Uh, okay, so he
02:06:28 Let's just ask Teddy Lee. Let's call up. Uh, who's that? Who's that guy who just died that edm artist guy?
02:06:34 Next all of them
02:06:36 Yeah, let's call the skrillex. Okay. Here we go. Next one is from uh at sandisky
02:06:42 This one is called a pcp songoo hashtag pcp theme
02:06:46 The description says this one goes out to my homie. That's what it says. Uh, so let let let us play it now. Here we go
02:06:58 Okay
02:07:01 Yes
02:07:04 Oh, there he is
02:07:19 Nice
02:07:24 I do like I don't know if I like as much as the last one, but I do like it
02:07:28 Yeah, I don't like it as much. I mean it's it's getting closer like it is it is melody focused
02:07:32 But okay, the melody is just a little bit too goofy for me. Like it was kind of perfect for me. That would be my theme
02:07:40 Yes
02:07:42 What what if we each whoever was hosting the episode had their own piece? Oh god. I mean, all right. Let's let's not let's not open that door
02:07:49 I mean, you know, we can each have a separate single for each of our character themes, right?
02:07:54 It's like uh, there was there was a thing that the one piece episodes did
02:07:58 Every one piece episode had like a break in the middle with a commercial break and during those breaks
02:08:02 They would pick one of I think up to nine, uh, like the little uh intermediate tracks that would play
02:08:07 That would be and all the all the members of the star had crew had like a little there would be an animation of them and their own theme
02:08:13 And uh, uh, you would be like whoever was like most relevant to that episode generally would be like the person
02:08:18 Here's what we do. Here. We have to change and evolve the the piece of people in contest. Here's what we do
02:08:24 You now have to make nine separate
02:08:27 From the character and they have to fit every leitmotif into one cohesive track that is both iconic
02:08:33 You have to do it. Yeah
02:08:35 Just like my boy you need to have to be intelligent and nihilistic like so great and powerful
02:08:40 Yeah, basically basically like condense s descend into like 30 seconds
02:08:46 Yeah, please do that all of you you fools
02:08:49 Uh, good work. Sorry. I don't appreciate that. All right. Next one's up is from at larkin loafin trap or arkin
02:08:56 This is what is this one? Just hashtag pcb theme entry. Okay. Here we go. Uh, let me fucking disconnect this
02:09:02 Play and go. Here we go
02:09:24 Oh
02:09:26 Hey
02:09:48 Oh my god, yeah
02:09:50 Dude
02:09:52 Guys, I know that I've been I've been pooping this entire idea and then I'm against it on every level
02:09:58 But that was kick ass. That was fucking
02:10:01 Okay, oh my god. This is what we've been waiting for. This is what it's built to you all doubted me
02:10:07 I'm sorry. I'm sorry to be a downer. It's not that it's not that I don't think that kicked ass
02:10:11 But I do
02:10:13 Kind of I do kind of mind that it does not reference like what the pcb actually is in any meaningful way
02:10:21 Ruins your life. Oh, no, that's what's good. That's why it's good. The pcb is such a weird nebulous thing
02:10:28 You're such a weird nebulous thing
02:10:30 They've re-context like they just reference to dog pcb. Yeah, I like it. It's funny. I like it. It's funny. I do like it. I do like it. I do like it.
02:10:37 Okay, but if we're talking about cons if we're talking pros and cons for me a big one big con of it is that it is not about
02:10:44 Okay, okay. Okay. Okay, but but but
02:10:47 Um, somebody sees like on youtube. There's this video
02:10:51 PCP colon some random topic. I like going to think that with that intro that it's about drugs even if
02:10:59 The drugs are not available. I think I know you guys have repeatedly brought up that you aren't really fond of the whole reference to drugs
02:11:06 I think it is literally
02:11:08 Negligible and just a funny goof and I don't think anyone's going to be confused. Oh my god a podcast called pcb
02:11:14 Obviously, they're talking about this incredibly illegal dangerous drug. That must be what's going on here. No, you're right
02:11:19 I don't think it's possible
02:11:20 But I'd love to see if someone can somehow
02:11:22 Abstractly not not like hammering in too much but tie it into the pcb from fucking bakuman
02:11:27 But there is no bakuman opening theme because it could never be an anime. So I wouldn't even know
02:11:33 You'll never have a good theme just like the pcb and bakuman because we'll never be an anime. We're too controversial
02:11:39 I'm a total tangent here, but wouldn't it be cool?
02:11:41 You guys if they made a bakuman ova where they just animated like all the series
02:11:46 Oh my god, I would be so awesome
02:11:49 I would not I want otters 11 right now. I was just gonna say I would pay so much money to see otters 11
02:11:54 Yeah, it's it's the best one by far. Um, well arcane. I mean needless to say, uh, incredible
02:12:01 Yeah, I think that was the best one so far. I love it
02:12:04 Amazing
02:12:05 Don't fucking yon at me you piece of shit. Go to sleep
02:12:08 Yeah, go to sleep fucking die
02:12:24 Uh, okay, we got another one up. Uh, this one's from uh shit
02:12:28 Gavin Watkins
02:12:30 Gavin, thank you the Gavin Watkins at yo, I'm hydra. So I guess he's also hydra. And here we go play immediately
02:12:38 All right
02:12:53 Oh, this is cute
02:12:58 Midi instruments, hell yes
02:13:01 Oh, yeah, well an instrumental of an adventure time song
02:13:05 I would say if I had to pick any of the ones that we've seen so far
02:13:08 I mean, okay, I would go for the the fucking dark island of nine souls one whatever the fuck that one was
02:13:12 But like if I had to pick a normal one like that would be the one I picked like I'm not like
02:13:16 Super great on it, but I'm assuming the person made this specifically reflecting all the things that I was saying
02:13:22 I wanted in the theme and they tried their best. I mean like I don't think I could I mean I couldn't do any fucking better
02:13:26 So good job there again. I like I like it and it sounds good
02:13:31 But it doesn't it doesn't strike me as
02:13:33 Right cp song
02:13:35 Yeah, I mean either but like it's at least it's at least somewhat in the right direction that I want at least
02:13:40 So like not that the tone is wrong or anything. It just it could be a song for a lot of things
02:13:45 Yeah, it could be a song for a lot of things. Yeah
02:13:47 I mean, I don't think it's necessarily a detour like the fucking dick show theme or even like
02:13:51 John Tron's theme, right? It's become his because it's John Tron not because it's a super distinct song
02:13:58 That's that's fair
02:14:00 I remember I used to be pretty obsessed. I really wanted like a theme song and I kind of have one with well for me
02:14:05 A map of I guess not really anymore
02:14:07 Uh, uh, I wanted one that was like like John Tron's and like I knew this the whole time
02:14:11 But really it was that like I wanted like to be
02:14:15 Famous like John Tron and just have a theme song that like was associated with that
02:14:19 It wasn't it wasn't like anything magical about the theme
02:14:21 He just fucking grabbed it off of like Newgrounds music portal
02:14:24 You told me that Ben and I spent like weeks hunting Newgrounds because I wanted to be like John Tron
02:14:29 And like find a theme on there and like it's not bad
02:14:33 You can go in there like that's how I found the music for the the the champion game that I made
02:14:37 I just went in there and I and I found a
02:14:40 Artist who had like their music was in there and listed as like yes
02:14:43 Anyone is allowed to use this music if you give credit. I was like, okay, sweet. That's so awesome. Yeah, it's fucking sick
02:14:48 Uh, okay. Well, we got we got one more for this round and this is from uh on the youtube is leos enigma
02:14:56 It's called should be surfing
02:14:58 TPC theme submissions should be surfing. Wait, what was there to let me get there?
02:15:02 It was uh dog of power. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Here we go and begin
02:15:15 I'm hearing a lot in my right channel. Yeah, not so much in the left
02:15:26 Oh
02:15:31 Okay
02:15:36 I'm not losing it leos you're losing them
02:15:42 Hey
02:15:43 This is I mean, is there a lot of am I am I crazy or is there a lot of the same note over and over again?
02:15:50 You're not wrong. You're not wrong
02:15:52 Uh
02:15:53 Leos, uh, I think that was a little simplistic for what I'm looking for
02:15:56 Yeah, I mean, would would you blame me leos my hero my friend for for choosing one of these other god kings compared to
02:16:03 I will say I offer it. I'm just kidding dude
02:16:05 I do like in general the idea of a podcast intro that employs the aesthetic of a like
02:16:11 Juicily plucked stringed instrument
02:16:14 But it would I wouldn't want it to be about like, you know unique notes being played like, you know
02:16:18 Just a very simple but nice and just melody and also that that aesthetic would never work for a podcast with seven people on it
02:16:25 Well, I don't mind what he was going for but I don't think the execution was quite there
02:16:30 Uh, it was you know, he just he this guy plucked a guitar
02:16:33 I mean, I I made demos of guitar stuff when I was practicing he plugged it in he recorded himself
02:16:37 And you know, you didn't do anything else to it. So yeah, what's that one?
02:16:39 What's that one fucking improvised like 10 second guitar thing by the guitarist from red hot chili peppers
02:16:45 It's just like it's just like really good 10 seconds of guitar improv. It's so fucking good
02:16:50 I'd put it on a podcast even if the podcast was totally different. So be as good as the guy from red hot chili peppers
02:16:56 Be as good as that guy flea. Yeah, that'll that'll not flee. It's the other guy
02:17:00 Uh, well guys, all right, that's it. So we're done. That's all of them for today. Now. This was provocative. This is this is fierce
02:17:05 This is fabulous. Uh, we these are going into the vault
02:17:08 Uh, and we'll get back to you on the july 1st or after july 1st when we when we have some information about the fucking theme
02:17:14 That we'll be using for the till the end of time
02:17:16 Uh, there you go. That's it. Okay, here we go
02:17:20 Time for a fucking fan art section. Yeah. Oh, I'm excited. I'm excited this fucking week. Oh, there's some good stuff guys
02:17:27 Oh, there's good stuff. I sincerely doubt there's any good stuff
02:17:31 I'm there's kind of a
02:17:33 Category that's collective. So before we get to that, let me just highlight these two the first is from gyaku shell
02:17:39 Uh, guys, just go to the fan art thing. You'll you'll see it there. Uh, oh my god. Oh my god
02:17:44 Look at this fucking rad con three arena arts. Oh, yeah, legendary. Oh, yeah, incredible. Yeah, this one's fucking incredible
02:17:51 It's uh, fucking all of us in our like intro poses that give us so beautifully
02:17:56 Animated why is she crying? I wasn't wondering that like why?
02:18:00 Because
02:18:03 Yeah, okay, and I I absolutely love school shooter aesthetic give in these. It's it's great. It's fantastic
02:18:10 And me looking absolutely devilish in the back. Absolutely devilish
02:18:15 God, this is so beautiful. This is like so good. And you know, I want the whole rad con logo
02:18:20 Like he redrew it himself. Like he didn't just use it. Oh my god. It's fucking and ben looking great
02:18:30 Tom looking also pretty school shootery
02:18:34 Excellent, or that he's just about to to slag some cryptos in fucking halo three if you know what I'm saying
02:18:39 I don't know what you're saying. I can't don't worry about your words
02:18:43 And and of course, uh, also did you there moving on?
02:18:48 Next image, uh, before we okay, this is the one I wanted to point out, um
02:18:52 I'll I'll put this in the fucking in the main chat here. Just so you can see it
02:18:55 This one of just of ben living the alternative lifestyle
02:19:01 Yeah, last week's episode
02:19:04 Why didn't he add me with this?
02:19:06 I he well, he just put it at the I mean because he listened to the episode obviously it's also ugly
02:19:11 By the way, this is this is uh at ill die 314. Oh wait, maybe dude. Yeah, I would this is fucking
02:19:17 This is true or I would I would legit frame this. This is excellent
02:19:22 How he explains it
02:19:25 Yes, it's because there's nothing going on here. That's what makes it beautiful. Yes. What does it mean to live the alternative?
02:19:32 Indistinguishable
02:19:36 Like the alternative lifestyle is pretty much defined by whatever it is that I do
02:19:41 That's true and it gives gives right it means to lean against an invisible chair
02:19:45 That's what it means
02:19:49 It's because you're you're so poor you just have to pretend you have
02:19:54 A chair sitting in the first place and you your high tier it's fourth dimensional consciousness manifested out of nothing
02:20:02 In in crowd I'm proud of myself
02:20:04 These are these are great. I love that one. Okay. Now we're getting into the themed section of our program here. Oh, yes
02:20:10 All right guys, so we went we went just before oh my god
02:20:12 The idea of the violent violence has uh has really taken off and a bunch of fan art has been drawn at our request of mage
02:20:22 Slaying in vicious gang warfare and being the leader in a in a third tribe. We know she is
02:20:28 post apocalypse a hellscape that is Lithuania
02:20:31 Indeed, so I never knew that Lithuania was an extension of endless war, but apparently it definitely is it's definitely
02:20:38 Okay, so look at this first one. So like corrupted purple slime leaked over there and shit went really bad
02:20:43 Oh, yeah, too. Totally. Okay. So look at look at the first one. I like the links for art
02:20:47 Okay, so this is I think the first one we got um already look at that jojo power pose mage. Yes her nail covered bat
02:20:54 The so okay now if I'm reading this crap, so that's a very endless war right there
02:20:58 With her light purple there. That's the violent violence versus the indigo interlopers or whatever the fuck we called him
02:21:05 Uh, that that's the ones who were dead on the bottom. Am I wrong? Yes, is that right?
02:21:08 Man, I really really wish I'd been on the fighting podcast. It sounds like it was a great time
02:21:15 God damn it and the tiger's oh
02:21:18 Oh, so it was in the fighting episode where the whole mages violent thing took off and became its own lore. Oh, okay
02:21:24 It's true. It's true. We went on like the discussions about mages like brutalities
02:21:30 Well, that's good. The only one on the fighting podcast who actually fought
02:21:34 It's true. It's true
02:21:36 I'm glad that I finally fucking incited a good pcp meme by like at like bringing this up because I remember two years ago
02:21:42 I was the one who fucking said she got about the yellow thing
02:21:45 Well, isn't it tom who said literally the violent violence? I believe I did coin the term but mage was the one who gave it life
02:21:52 So this one by links is my favorite pcp fan art ever. It's so dynamic. It's uh, I love mages pose here
02:21:59 I absolutely love it. What's up with the tigers are tigers a thing?
02:22:05 From the discussion. Yes. Uh, like yes, I said like that's the true actually listen back
02:22:11 I'm not gonna
02:22:12 Yeah, we don't want to ruin it for you here. Okay. You're really gonna experience in line. Right?
02:22:18 If I was like
02:22:19 Yeah, go ahead mage's uh
02:22:21 Links's art is so good at like carefully controlled derpiness like the derpy look on mage's face in the center is perfect
02:22:28 Her incredible dominant pose. It's amazing
02:22:31 And I just love how she's just so like plainly feminine as well with just like a plain
02:22:36 A skirt
02:22:40 Yeah, it's very cute looks like a girl who like goes to school
02:22:43 But then like on her way home from school. She picks up her bat and you know, yeah
02:22:47 Takes her tiger. It's it's like in the it's like in fucking like japanese mage and shit
02:22:52 Yeah, exactly. You've got just like cute girls who are all so badasses, you know, generally. Yeah
02:22:57 It's a good aesthetic. I love it. All right. Well, this one's a winner
02:23:00 Obviously, uh, way to fucking go links for art. This is the best one. Okay. Wait a minute. Maybe those are links
02:23:05 Because this person's a links. I mean, I don't fucking
02:23:09 Hard to say
02:23:11 Okay, so the next one is from uh never paint. Uh, let me link it fucking here in the main thing
02:23:22 This is this is also my new favorite pcp fan art of all
02:23:27 Also, if you look at the pens, it's not very big. That's like drawn pretty small and they got all that detail. That's true. That's pretty impressive
02:23:34 Excuse me. Um, but you did not use the correct the hexadecimal value for mage's artwork
02:23:39 I would please like it if you would correct this. Oh, I am lethal aura mage. Please do not disrespect me
02:23:43 That's right. You got it. You didn't go out and buy the hexadecimal pens that you can get correct hexadecimal value
02:23:49 So there's a lot of details in this one and I think a lot of them are references
02:23:52 Like I see a drug needle. I think and I remember her referencing drug needles in the childhood episode
02:23:56 Uh, oh shit. I didn't even know there's also what looks to be like
02:23:59 There's a yo-yo on the ground or a prostitution house in the back skull vandalism skull graffiti over there
02:24:05 Right, but there's also like there's also a building that has a flag out with like a heart
02:24:10 I'm assuming it's like a whorehouse or maybe a warehouse or something. What's kind of presumptuous?
02:24:15 I don't know
02:24:17 Yeah, as ben with his heart avatar obviously a prostitution
02:24:20 Yeah, please. No, no, no, quit heart shaming. But let's depart his fellow heart users
02:24:25 The stop sign that I threw stones at
02:24:28 Oh
02:24:29 Is that oh, yeah
02:24:32 Is that is that a lithuanian stop sign though? Is that what they look like? I recognize it as a stop sign. Okay
02:24:37 Oh, yeah, no, no. Yes. Okay, so sorry not a stop sign the sign, but it was a triangle. Sorry
02:24:43 I I didn't mean it as I just I just got so excited about this
02:24:47 I like you know, you know what that sign says it's got a black dot in the center a danger rocks will be thrown at this sign
02:24:52 Watch out. There's lots amazing. Um
02:24:55 Like both both never paint and links are on my fucking rolodex
02:25:00 If I want to go around shopping people to like hire commission people to do illustrations for something in some point in my career
02:25:06 Like these people are top on my fucking list
02:25:09 Fuck
02:25:11 Yes
02:25:14 Very nuanced and it's in its references. There's so much going on there. I'm I'm I'm actually it's so dense
02:25:19 There's so much going on. There's so much going on because I was for the shit like I never owned a yo-yo
02:25:23 I always wanted a yo-yo
02:25:26 Oh
02:25:27 Fucking dope, dude. I just love how like it's all like it's fucking wrecked like all these. Yes. This is like wrecked buildings
02:25:34 It's so cool. This is urban
02:25:36 It absolutely is. Uh, so okay. Next one is from our boy l1 cas lue with some underscores
02:25:42 Fucking links lanes lanes lines as moment. Oh, right
02:25:47 Lames, whatever. He's yeah
02:25:49 We got the post cold war tigers more tiger memes excellent
02:25:53 And I hope he doesn't feel bad that like we were taking him after the two like masterpiece arts like this is good
02:25:59 Like, you know, I hope it doesn't feel too shown up. But like this is pretty cool
02:26:03 The expression is really good. The expression is great. Yeah slames slames has like a very like rough like pen
02:26:09 I quite like it a lot. He goes with the theme. I like how in the background it sort of looks like
02:26:15 The pain's coming off sort of sort of that sort of look. Yeah. Oh, it's yeah
02:26:20 Oh, it's a bit grungy look. Oh, it's it's yeah, it's a tiger. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Okay. I didn't notice that
02:26:26 Those eyes are intense. It's fucking awesome. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
02:26:30 He's using his photoshop skills. It's a great effect. It's beautiful. Beautiful. So true
02:26:35 Well, I don't have much more to say about this. I love the the goofy city in the background
02:26:39 But okay, and we I think we mage just posted this one in the thing
02:26:42 Uh, they they always seem to roll in right around when we're recording. We get a bunch more. Well, they know we're recording
02:26:47 It's time. Look at this one from at miski from miski. Miski's really good. And I fucking love this
02:26:54 Fucking solid snake mage urban warfare killer
02:26:57 She's just fucking
02:26:59 Oh, shit. I was wondering if this was
02:27:01 I just love how there's just oh, yeah, this like there's just so many different ways to interpret metal gear, right?
02:27:07 Like it's all the same concept. We have these videos all the same pocket
02:27:10 Yeah, because at one point mage gets banned from her neighborhood and has to sneak around everywhere and hippo specifically said it's now metal gear
02:27:17 And here it is
02:27:19 Oh, shit. You know, I love it. I love the color. This is so good. I love how the
02:27:23 Orange and purple orange and purple in the foreground and then the yellow the yellow orange the background and then the yellow on mage
02:27:30 I really like the light coming through the tire swing
02:27:34 Mm-hmm
