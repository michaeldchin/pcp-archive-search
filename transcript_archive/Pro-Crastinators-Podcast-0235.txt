00:00:00 Hello, welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm Ben Saint. We got Gibbontake with us as well.
00:00:16 Hello everybody. Hello, and our guests this week. We have another guest. Audience, commenters,
00:00:27 I don't care how much you hate our guests. We're going to keep doing it. Guest this week is...
00:00:33 I care. Listen, if you hate me, email this podcast about it, not me.
00:00:39 If you hate... That goes for forever. Please put that on all of your future work. Just like,
00:00:46 if you don't like this, just send an email to theprocrastinatorsmail.com. Anyway, this is a
00:00:54 Jim Storm dancer. Hi. Hello. Who I was shocked to find is your real name.
00:01:00 Yes. I thought it was just a Twitter handle. And then I thought, oh, maybe there's an Elizabeth
00:01:08 Warren thing going on, like a one-thousandth Cherokee. It was like a Native American name or
00:01:14 something. No, no. So when my wife and I got married, we decided we neither of us wanted to
00:01:21 be named after the other one's dad. Yeah. So we picked a new name, and it's really more than
00:01:26 anything, it's a riff on Luke Skywalker. Right. Which is itself probably appropriating Native
00:01:34 American style names. Probably. Yeah, one imagines. But yes, anyway, Jim Storm dancer is the creator
00:01:43 of Frog Fractions, among other games, including but not limited to Frog Fractions 2,
00:01:49 and Frog Fractions Game of the Decade edition. And I think we have on our channel a very long
00:02:01 Let's Play videos, Rowdyfuckers, cop killers episode, I don't know, six or whatever. For me
00:02:07 and Munchie, we played Frog Fractions 2. I think it was like a five-hour video or something.
00:02:12 Wow, you marathoned it. We did marathon it. And you know, I'm sorry to say I never actually
00:02:17 finished it. I was gonna because me and him never got around to doing the rest of it.
00:02:23 But yeah, I played I played Frog Fractions 1 back when it came out in 2012, I think,
00:02:30 something like that. Yeah, it was October 2012. October 2012. Right. Yeah, I played that when it
00:02:36 came out. You know, I saw the, you know, I don't even remember where I saw some people vague posting
00:02:44 about it, maybe it was on 4chan or something awful or something. Just like, have you seen this game?
00:02:49 I'm not going to say what it is. You should play this game. I was like, OK, I guess I will. And
00:02:56 I won't, I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't know. If anyone hasn't played it, I recommend it.
00:03:00 Check it out. It's free on twinbeer.com. Right. But if you don't, if it's like three months from
00:03:10 now, you won't be able to play it because Flash is going away. Yeah, I went this morning, I like
00:03:16 booted it up to take another look and I got the notice that's like Flash won't be supported
00:03:20 past December 2020. I was like, oh my, oh my God. Oh no, this fucking game. But it's OK. I made it all
00:03:28 better because I did a remake in On Steam and it's actually it's high res, so you don't have to
00:03:36 stare at a 640 by 480 postage stamp to play the game.
00:03:42 When I, when I saw, like I heard about Game of the Decade Edition and I, I just,
00:03:50 I don't know how much, I don't know. Do you want to, should I skip past talking about it? Should I
00:03:55 not say anything about it? Is it secrets? Oh, you're asking me if I put secrets in my own game?
00:04:01 Is that what's happening here? No, no, no. I played the Steam version. It's just the
00:04:05 same. It's just for fractions again, but on, you know, preserved. Yes, yes, that's correct. It's,
00:04:11 it was preserved as, as closely as possible to the original. However, there is DLC.
00:04:18 I was going to say, oh, oh, OK, because I read your article on your blog. Yeah. And I was reading
00:04:23 that and I was like, wait a minute. I don't know who these characters are. Yeah. This is not the
00:04:28 same game. Listen, if you, you wear a hat with the DLC, OK. You pay, you pay 10 bucks and you get
00:04:34 this hat and your frog looks dapper as heck. Nice. While you're eating bugs. And that's,
00:04:42 that's definitely all it is. I see. Yeah. I mean, 10 dollars well spent. Since, since the original
00:04:50 was free and all. Right. OK. Yeah, I was, I was, you know, I think when you, when you posted this
00:04:56 article, I went and I, and I looked at it and I was like, oh, there's, there's, there's more. Oh,
00:05:02 no. Oh, no. And I, I'm going to get around to playing it. I haven't gotten around to it yet,
00:05:06 but it's on my, it's on my to-do list. I think, I think you'll find it a lot more approachable
00:05:12 than Frog Fractions 2 was. OK. Like you were talking about how you spent five hours on that
00:05:18 thing and didn't finish it. Like I had intended it to be finishable in like two or three hours.
00:05:25 It turns out, turns out it was a lot harder than that for most people.
00:05:30 There were, I mean, Frog Fractions 1 is not that long and yet, well, I, I had a lot of trouble
00:05:38 with it actually. Sure. There was, I remember at the beginning, it took me forever. Spoilers
00:05:46 for Frog Fractions 1. Don't, don't listen to this. You haven't played it, but it took me forever to
00:05:50 realize that I could go under the water. Sure. And then, and then, so I spent like, oh, because
00:05:56 people assured me like, no, no, no, give this game a chance. Give this, I'm like, OK, I guess I'm
00:06:01 giving it a chance. I, I feel like I spent an hour just like turning the cyber brain on and off, or
00:06:06 is that what it's called? The one that changes you. The lock on. The lock on. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:06:11 Just like, and like, you know, just doing that over and it's like, what, where is this going? What's
00:06:16 and then I also got stuck on the text adventure portion. I had to, I don't remember what it was.
00:06:22 I don't remember what part it was, but I had to look up a hint at some point.
00:06:26 Yeah, no shame. Nobody knows how to, like when I made that game, I basically originally made it for
00:06:32 my audience of, you know, I had a couple dozen friends who I thought would enjoy it and that was
00:06:38 it. Yeah. And I had no idea that I would be inflicting text adventures on the world at large.
00:06:45 Um, yeah, I mean, so it goes, I guess. That's you never know. You never know what's going to be
00:06:53 the thing that blows up. But then I did that on purpose with like ZZT style dungeon crawls in
00:06:59 the second game. So yeah, I had never. Is ZZT a worthwhile game? I didn't know about it. The only
00:07:08 way that I know about it is that the main frog fractions game is like a reference to it. And
00:07:15 I thought that part of frog fraction was really cool in and of itself. Yeah. If you did like it,
00:07:21 then you might. So ZZT is actually really interesting. It's a game by Tim Sweeney,
00:07:28 who went on to make the Unreal Engine. And like Unreal, like the game Unreal, it is a game that
00:07:37 like was shipped and sold as a video game. But by far the most interesting part of it was the
00:07:43 level editor. So it was a lot of people's first foray into game design. And so it was extremely
00:07:54 through the level editor. Yes, it was extremely influential in that regard. It was like early
00:07:58 90, like 1991 or something. Yeah. PC users found this game and made their own worlds with it.
00:08:08 And it's real hard to go back to now. Like just the it's not super playable. Like believe it or
00:08:14 not, like despite all the the bullshit I pulled in in text world, it's a lot more the feel of it
00:08:22 is a lot better than the original ZZT was. Yeah, like you kind of you do do some like graphics
00:08:30 stuff. It's not all like, I mean, I play I play some ASCII games, like I play a dungeon
00:08:37 Crawlstone soup, you familiar? Yeah. Yeah. Although I play with a tile set. Oh, sure. Yeah. Because
00:08:43 I'm weak, though. So I mean, you know, the the a bit of a esoteric interface doesn't really
00:08:51 doesn't really bother me too much. Well, the thing is, so what I'm talking about specifically is
00:08:59 ZZT is an action game, but it uses like the default OS key repeat for movement. So
00:09:08 you key repeat, meaning so, you know, when you hold down a letter on the keyboard,
00:09:16 one letter appears in the text box, and then like a second later, a bunch of letters start
00:09:20 appearing in the text box of the same one. Yeah, sure. Okay, that's what I mean by key repeat. So
00:09:27 in ZZT, if you want to move left, you hope you can push left once to move one step left,
00:09:33 or you can there's a second, or you can hold it down, and it'll go left once, and then it'll
00:09:38 wait a second, and it'll start going left in a bunch of times. Yeah, and it's really does not,
00:09:44 it doesn't feel good to to operate like and I actually did a frog fractions too is the same
00:09:50 though, right? It is, but it's tuned way differently. I see. You did it deliberately.
00:09:58 Yeah, yeah. Instead of just inheriting it, I suppose. Right, yeah, right.
00:10:08 Gib, you haven't played frog fractions too. I know I did what you play for those five hours.
00:10:14 That's right. I think a fun part of I think was it the first frog fractions you did like
00:10:21 another video where I think we did where where you played the game but like in the course of the
00:10:28 video, you sort of got derailed and started Google image searching things and looking at
00:10:33 Wikipedia's and it the video itself sort of became a reflection of what frog fractions is as a game,
00:10:39 which is that's beautiful, right? Because the video it's the video itself, right, right. I
00:10:44 remember. Yeah, there was sort of like a meta joke to that when we're like the video pretends to be
00:10:49 a video where we play frog fractions, but instead it is about, you know, entirely separate things.
00:10:54 That's right. I had like forgotten, but that was a thing at the time. Yeah, you know, I wanted to
00:11:00 I wanted to be, you know, wanted to be like Jim. Yeah, oh man. So I'm looking forward to
00:11:10 looking forward to checking the DLC out. That's great. My little brother is is also game developer.
00:11:19 He's he's just finished uni and he's he's working with people doing game jams and stuff. Nice. And
00:11:26 he made I was very surprised at this. He had a game called road toads, which was like a little
00:11:34 3D game where it had toads on cars driving around in another rfck video we did a road road toads
00:11:42 yeah through I and the the idea is you're just driving around as a toad and it's you know,
00:11:48 it's a fun little game, but he had visions of it being like, you know, you there's a revelation
00:11:54 and you find out that there's more to it and all this stuff. And I said, oh, that's reminds me
00:11:58 of frog fractions. And he was like, what the hell's that? And he was so disappointed to find that
00:12:05 someone is also done. Someone has already made a frog game with a drug game with a twist. And he
00:12:10 was like, oh, this is a genre. Next, you told him about frog detective haunted island.
00:12:18 I don't know about that. Oh, you should definitely check out the frog detective series.
00:12:23 Oh, it's a whole series. There's only two of them. But technically, that's a series.
00:12:29 Is it like, um, oh, I'm looking at it. Is it like a point and click? It's like a point and click
00:12:36 if a point and click were first person like a first person shooter style movement.
00:12:42 But it plays like a point and click adventure.
00:12:45 Makes sense. Makes sense. This looks cool. And I think they did that just so they wouldn't have
00:12:49 to animate the main character running around. Yeah. Yeah. I had a similar story from
00:12:59 back when I was making frog fractions. There was another Bay Area game developer
00:13:05 making a game called Total Toads. A lot of frog and we heard about yeah. And we heard about each
00:13:13 other. And I I just assumed, okay, he's making like an educational game. But he thought that I
00:13:20 was making an educational game as well. And was like, oh, there's a rival frog educational game
00:13:24 developer. And it turns out like you can't get his game anymore. It shipped on iPhone and it
00:13:31 doesn't work on modern iPhones. But it was a game about adding and subtracting with frog with toads
00:13:36 rather. Total Toads. Total Toads. So it's got the alliteration to it. Yeah. It's
00:13:48 pretty good. It's like, no, stop honing in on my market. Yeah. Have you have you seen them?
00:13:54 Do you know the catamites? Oh, yeah. Have you seen his his frog blog? I have not seen that.
00:14:01 He I don't know if he still does it. But he had a little blog page where he would he would rate
00:14:07 games solely based on like the appearances of frogs within them and stuff. So he would like,
00:14:15 I don't remember. But like, you know, he was like, yeah, cave stories got some some pretty
00:14:19 good frog enemies. You know, they don't do very they're not in very much the game. But you know,
00:14:24 they're good for what they are, you know, seven out of 10. Right. Oh, you know, in, you know,
00:14:29 whatever. Yeah, yeah, he'll just rate really rated the frogs, basically. Now I'm curious. Now I want
00:14:35 to find out what the catamites had to say about the frogs and frog fractions. I don't know. I,
00:14:43 you know, I feel like I should know whether or not frog fractions made the cut for that list. But
00:14:48 I but I don't well off the top. If the blog is is continuing into the future, and maybe it will,
00:14:55 it will in the unknowable future. I think it's probably still on Harmony Zone
00:15:03 somewhere on that fucking Technicolor nightmare. Angel fire. Yeah, yeah. The web ring or whatever.
00:15:12 Right. So how is you, both of you? How is your Halloween? How is how's how's life? Who's going
00:15:22 first? Well, I guess I can go first. Yeah, go for it. My Halloween was uneventful. And that's
00:15:31 that's exactly how I enjoy it. Usually, you know, obviously put up decorations, people come around
00:15:37 the door, trick or treat with COVID. Nobody did that. And we didn't put up decorations to encourage
00:15:43 it. Instead, I carved some pumpkins with goofy faces. And usually they're out in the front.
00:15:51 And then they get like, by the next morning, they're all like brought in. So we just throw them
00:15:55 away. But this time they were inside. And so I decided to burn them. I said to light a fire
00:16:01 inside the pumpkin. And that was what I did with my evening. So I just because it's a it's a vegetable,
00:16:07 it's got a lot of moisture in it. You just threw like wood in there. I put I put logs and kindling
00:16:11 newspaper and I lit them in the fireplace. And it was it was it was very scary at some points.
00:16:19 Because you don't need them after after tomorrow or after the day. And yeah, but the the effect was
00:16:24 really quite striking because it's like, it's a guy's face and it's fires coming out of it and
00:16:29 is getting singed to the sides. It's cool. I was gonna say I've been listening to a YouTube series
00:16:37 called Goose Drunks, where this girl Bailey Myers just reads Goosebumps books. But she
00:16:45 she takes a drink. She has some rules, like whenever stupid things happen or spooky things happen.
00:16:52 That just reminded me of that series that I've been getting into lately, in which I recommend,
00:16:57 because there's one Goosebumps book where some kids have jack-o-lantern pumpkin heads.
00:17:04 That's that's it. That's the only connection. Okay. What were you saying? I say interrupted
00:17:11 for that. Oh, I was I was going to say that if you had filmed it, then it would make it great.
00:17:18 One of those videos where you know how you can find on Netflix, there's like a video that's just
00:17:24 a video of like an hour of a fireplace. Yes, an hour of like a pumpkin face slowly melting
00:17:32 would be fantastic. It'd probably be like 45 seconds of a pumpkin face disintegrating. Well,
00:17:40 on fire. Because yeah, like I was saying that it's a it's a vegetable and it was quite fresh. I
00:17:46 only cut it like the day or two before. There's a lot of moisture in there. So it actually the fire
00:17:50 was struggling to stay alive. So I was feeding that I was literally feeding it through the
00:17:58 mouth of the pumpkin fuel. That's pretty cute. I did film like few little 45 second chunks of it,
00:18:06 but I didn't set up anything because it was like in the living room. And parents were there watching
00:18:12 TV. It was sort of like we had to set up a camera. Right. So you couldn't make the theatrical
00:18:18 theatrical screaming noises either. No, do you do you? Did you save the seeds? Seeds? Oh,
00:18:28 yes. Well, yeah, I did. My brother was going to make a kind of a pumpkin pie. Yeah, something like
00:18:35 that. Yeah. You know, they're nice. You can you just you just put them up. You just bake them.
00:18:41 You just season them however you want. You bake them. You can make sweet cinnamon.
00:18:44 You can do like garlic and herb or just the seeds on their own. I mean, yeah, you should probably
00:18:52 salt them at least. What we did was we we actually boiled them in salt water to in order to salt them.
00:19:00 It's the best way apparently to get even salting. You know,
00:19:07 and then we baked them just to be clear. OK, OK, OK, OK, I was going to because like I was introduced
00:19:14 when I lived in the south, I was introduced to boiled peanuts. And I got to say they're gross
00:19:19 and I hate them. Yeah, I don't think I had I don't know if I had a peanut. They're so much worse
00:19:24 than just just cooking them like a normal human being. I don't I don't understand what you're
00:19:28 saying. Is that is that roasting? Is that is? Yeah, roast them. Yeah, roast them in the oven.
00:19:33 OK. Or or in whatever. Yeah, you roast them. That's roasted peanuts. Typically, I get them out of
00:19:39 the jar with the peanut guy with the top hat on it. Well, well, they because they roasted them,
00:19:44 right? Because they roast them because they know because they when you boil them, they turn into
00:19:49 like these soft. They taste like beans like it brings out. They're sort of like like like earthy
00:19:54 like beanie flavor. And it's I hate it. It's the texture like it's like a like a one of a chickpea.
00:20:01 It's very similar to interesting soft. Yeah, OK, all right. Time for a visual metaphor.
00:20:06 If Mr. Peanut was was boiled instead of roasted, what would he be wearing?
00:20:13 Well, he'd be big, swollen, soggy.
00:20:20 He would look like he has. He'd look like he was like covered in like eczema.
00:20:29 But like he already has some sort of skin skin condition.
00:20:34 He'd be all puffed up and darker in color and seeping just seeping.
00:20:42 I don't know. It's not for you. Anyway, I feel feel very strongly
00:20:46 about boiled peanuts and how you shouldn't do it. I know some people are big fans,
00:20:50 but I don't like those people and I don't trust them. Maybe you could make a homicide of it.
00:20:57 You said you said hummus, but I heard homicide. Maybe I could make a great homicide out of it.
00:21:05 That too. Makes you think. No.
00:21:10 It does, though, I promise. How was your Halloween, Jim?
00:21:15 You know, it was great. We we never get trick or treaters.
00:21:21 But this year we were like, well, we're we're going to now in covid times, it's time to go all out.
00:21:28 And we is it if we set up a table outside with a big tray painted to look like a Ouija board
00:21:36 and like Halloween colored Christmas lights and pumpkins all around it and a bunch of candy on
00:21:44 the tray and and hand sanitizer on the table. You put it out. You put it out for no one.
00:21:51 So pretty much pretty there was one group like that came by as we were going to bed
00:22:00 that were very excited and came by and yelled up. I don't know if they knew we were going to hear
00:22:06 them, but they yelled, thank you. Merry Christmas. And it was very sweet. And there was it sounded
00:22:13 like there were like four people in the group. So like four people took handfuls of candy. So
00:22:18 better than nothing. OK, yeah, it's not no one. And we also had we have our two year old Winston
00:22:25 who we wanted like we got to teach this kid how holidays work. So we did a very minimal
00:22:34 like just five houses or so. Trick or treat run he and he didn't want to we had gotten a costume
00:22:43 so he could dress up as Mario and he was like on the day of he was like, no, I don't want to wear
00:22:47 he doesn't speak that well. But he was like, no, I don't want to wear that.
00:22:50 Yeah. But he was willing to wear his pajamas that have bones printed on the front. So he could
00:22:57 look like a skeleton. Yeah, you know what? Yeah. But he just he just wears that all year round.
00:23:03 He does. OK, I mean, it's still fine. But but the neighbors don't know.
00:23:08 Yeah, yeah, it's not for him. Yeah, yeah. So we went we went to a couple of houses and like
00:23:13 surprisingly, we did our usual thing of like, well, is the porch light on or the house lights on
00:23:19 is their decorations of guessing like which houses are going to be participating. And like 50% of
00:23:25 people that we tried answered the door and gave us candy. So like people are still wanting to
00:23:31 participate in this thing. Sure. Of course. But yeah, this is not a high traffic trigger
00:23:37 treat neighborhood. So I think like my if like if next year he seems to be ready to step it up,
00:23:45 we have to figure out where are the kids actually going? Yeah, you might just like make a little
00:23:51 evening trip out to some like more tightly packed neighborhood, I guess. Yeah, dual circuit. Yeah.
00:23:58 Yeah, yeah. My house growing up. I yeah, I was on kind of like a country road, like not exactly in
00:24:05 like the complete boonies or whatever, but like, you know, in like a pretty, pretty loosely packed
00:24:11 like sort of suburban country town. And so we would on like a good year, we would get one
00:24:16 trick or treat. Yeah. Yeah. But now, I mean, now I live on a more on a more dense street.
00:24:25 And so we probably would have but I don't think I don't think anyone came to our door yesterday,
00:24:30 or maybe I just wasn't paying attention. Well, you know, I was going to have some,
00:24:35 I was going to have some friends over, Kazi and Munchie, give you know him, Jim, you don't know
00:24:40 him, we're going to be over. But then we're just going to hang out in my backyard, because like
00:24:45 that's what we've been doing. You know, social distancing guests don't come in the house,
00:24:50 we hang on my backyard. And it snowed, it snowed yesterday, and there was still snow on the ground.
00:24:56 And so I said, oh, and crack and shell, it wasn't just a bunch of people, whatever.
00:25:01 Anyway, it snowed at the wrong time. I didn't want to like squat in the snow in my backyard.
00:25:04 So I said, no, Halloween's canceled, everyone, go home. So I didn't do anything. I was grumpy all
00:25:12 day about it. But you know what, dumb holiday, dumb holiday anyway, who needs it? Right? Am I
00:25:20 right? Yeah, hell yeah. It's the sweetest holiday. Oh, Winston. Oh, sorry, gone. I was going to say
00:25:28 the other thing, the other thing that ruined my Halloween was because it snowed. I finally had
00:25:34 to take my air conditioner out of my window. And I had to take it out of my window and move it over
00:25:41 my bed to get it into my closet to store because I have like a low, well, the snow, I don't know
00:25:46 if you know where this is going, but the snow had gotten into the air conditioner and the whole
00:25:51 thing was wet. And as I was moving it over my bed, all the snow water, like poured out of it
00:25:57 and like soaked my bed. So what I had to do last night, I had to, I took like saran wrap,
00:26:06 I had to like spread saran wrap over this big wet area in my bed and put a blanket over it
00:26:11 and sleep on top of that. It felt dry. Yeah, some people feel extra for that kind of bed.
00:26:19 And you know what? I woke up in the morning and I checked and it was dry again. So
00:26:24 problem solved. I just hope it didn't have any like weird like black mold or fungus in it,
00:26:27 you know, that's like a living in my mattress now. Oh dear. Winston, when we were out walking this
00:26:35 morning, he wanted to get more candy. He walked up, he started walking up a neighbor's driveway
00:26:42 saying get candy. Yeah, yeah. I have to explain like, sorry, this is just yesterday, buddy. Oh,
00:26:49 okay. He thought this isn't, oh, so this is what all, this is what all those other houses are for.
00:26:54 Right. You can get candy from them if you ask. I see. Smart, smart, smart kid. He's a pattern
00:27:03 matcher. I see. I see my new angle. So this is, now I didn't tell you this. I'm springing this on
00:27:18 you, but it's nevertheless true that you're not merely our guest this episode. You are actually
00:27:25 interviewing right now to be the new replacement member since all of our other members have
00:27:32 abandoned us. So how do you feel you're doing? I think I'm doing great. You think you're killing
00:27:45 it? Well, we'll see about that. Listen, I'm here to interview you. Okay. Oh, I didn't prepare
00:27:53 anything. I do want to say, I didn't, this is technically a crossover with your podcast
00:28:02 Topic Lords, which I didn't know you had. Yeah, I guess technically it is. Yeah, I didn't know
00:28:08 about it until very recently as I was looking up stuff related to you in the week leading up to
00:28:14 having you on. And I was like, oh, he's got a podcast too. I wonder if he knows the pain.
00:28:21 Surely he must also know the pain of having all of his other podcast members turn on him
00:28:28 and abandon them to their fate. That's just part of the experience.
00:28:36 Yeah, so Topic Lords is a weekly podcast, TopicLords.com. The only place on the internet,
00:28:43 you can hear us to discuss topics. It's me and two guests. Every week, it's two different guests.
00:28:55 And the guests bring topics to discuss. And it's very freeform. One of the listeners described it
00:29:03 to me as a place for people with ADHD to gush about their fixations. Oh, there's a market for
00:29:12 that seems pretty accurate. But so, yes, I, the last last episode I recorded was pushed back
00:29:22 twice because both of the guests forgot they were recording. Sure. Oh, like, oh my god.
00:29:30 Like they started the episode and just there was no. Oh, no, I mean, like I was I was messaging them
00:29:36 on, however, I know them on Discord or whatever. And they were just like, oh, I forgot about it.
00:29:42 Can we do this later? Oh, sure. And then they both answered that way. And I was like, luck,
00:29:48 you're in luck. The other guests also forgot. Yeah, lucky you. You're not, you're not the odd man out.
00:29:54 Right. Technically, you're the weird one because you remembered. Well, my wife had to remind me.
00:30:01 Oh, okay, few. Good, good. I am very diligent. And I never forget an episode. And I'm here,
00:30:12 and I'm here rain or shine, because I care, viewers, because I give a shit. And you're all welcome.
00:30:20 Oh, yes. Yes.
00:30:26 Well, that's all my notes. I don't know. Show's over.
00:30:34 I don't know how. Yeah, go on. Yeah. Mr. Frog, Mr. Fraction.
00:30:41 Storm dancer. Storm dancer. Yeah, please. Storm dancer. Fraction was my dad's name.
00:30:47 I'm only a fraction, fraction. Okay, all right. Game development is a cool thing.
00:30:56 I've wanted to, oh, really? Yeah, it's cool when it works. It's cool when it works out.
00:31:05 Making the game is great. It's all the parts where you try to get other people to pay to play
00:31:11 the game. That part sucks. Oh, yeah. Oh, that's that's always been like with any art thing. It's
00:31:18 like, I love what I'm doing. And then you've got to eat and you've got to make the money so you
00:31:23 can eat. And it's like that goes in that flies in the face of art in itself sucks. Marketing is
00:31:33 you have to like spec some of your talent points into like being a soul sucking vampire in order
00:31:38 to actually make money. It's been a problem. Yeah, because I noticed business that like
00:31:45 for fractions one obviously was free and it was big. And then for fractions two is like
00:31:51 the whole idea of making a sequel to something with brand recognition is so that you don't have
00:31:59 to do as much work to get it seen and bought. Yeah. And you did the cool thing, which was to make it
00:32:09 like not put your name on it, not call it frog fractions, release it secretly with an ARG.
00:32:14 And it's all like really interesting and cool and unique, but not good for capitalizing on,
00:32:21 you know, on the things that you're supposed to do in this world.
00:32:27 And I was trying to do, I mean, so obviously the reason I did that was that I hate the marketing
00:32:34 side of things. And this was effectively like, I'm promising I'm never going to do any marketing
00:32:40 on this game, which is itself like it's audacious enough that people are going to talk about it.
00:32:45 So it becomes itself a form of marketing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that worked. But
00:32:52 I don't know. It was frog fractions two at this point, like a success in terms of being able
00:32:58 to get away with being so audacious, like non marketing marketing. Yeah. So it's technically
00:33:06 profitable. But we didn't pay the best kind of profitable. Yeah. We didn't pay people very well.
00:33:15 So like that's not a very high bar. I definitely would have made more money if I called it frog
00:33:23 fractions two. Right. Yeah. Because then people would knowing where to get it is like a pretty good
00:33:31 is like, that's like the first hurdle you got to clear. Yeah. But that's pretty high for frog
00:33:37 fractions to that right. But I also definitely would have made more money if the main minigame had
00:33:44 art. Like I did ZZT style stuff because I'm nostalgic for that art style. And because
00:33:51 it was a style that I could do without paying a bunch of money out of an art budget, which I didn't
00:33:58 have basically. I mean, I do like the way it looks. It's very I do too. But it's very spiky.
00:34:05 Like a lot of people don't like a lot of people are really turned off by that. And if I had made
00:34:10 that look like, you know, Zelda one, for example, I think a lot more people would have been into
00:34:17 that. Yeah, Zelda one or like Minecraft, something that that can. Yeah. Minecraft is amazing and how
00:34:26 it can get away with such, you know, low, low resolution textures and low poly things because
00:34:33 I don't know. It's just the game. It's so fun. Yep.
00:34:39 So it's always a challenge because I'm like, I make comics, but I'm not that good at drawing yet.
00:34:47 So I'm trying to figure out how I can make comics without really being good.
00:34:52 Give us hard on yourself. Give us hard on yourself about the drawing thing. But you've
00:34:58 improved. I mean, we've said this before. I don't want to, not to go on a side, but I really do
00:35:01 want to tell you again, how much you've improved and like your last couple of things like Clarissa
00:35:06 looks Clarissa looks like much better than Lord of Ghost, which looks much better than
00:35:13 Bail Jade, you know, for instance, just I can't let that go unsaid.
00:35:17 Have baited. I baited you into complimenting me again, you fool. Yeah, this is the one.
00:35:25 Yeah. It was just saying like
00:35:29 the with the comics, I'm not terrible, but like, I have improved. Thank you, Ben.
00:35:36 You're welcome.
00:35:37 But it's it's always been a thing where like, I'm trying to think of ways that I can
00:35:43 make it engaging and marketable and good and people would want to see it regardless of how
00:35:49 much it looks like the best thing ever, you know, you play to my strengths,
00:35:54 play to the things that work, because like people make snap judgments when they see something.
00:36:00 And if it doesn't look the greatest, you may as well make it look the most unique or, you know,
00:36:06 there's there's all these different things you can do to make it striking and I don't know.
00:36:12 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I've put a lot of thought into this sort of thing because
00:36:17 I'm a largely a solo developer with without an art background. My skill sets are
00:36:25 programming and music and writing, basically. And so I've put a bunch of
00:36:33 like research and thought into like, how do people do programmer art that looks good,
00:36:40 that is appealing to people and like the most basic form of it is something like
00:36:43 geometry wars, which is just geometric shapes with a nice bloom filter applied, basically.
00:36:52 Yeah. And I think like something along those lines might be your solution like you like you could
00:37:02 like you could use Blender to pose 3D mannequins or something like that.
00:37:07 Yeah. I thought of things like that, like like a multimedia sort of thing. I mean,
00:37:14 Bailhape, my first comic was like MS Paint crap, but I made up for that by having
00:37:21 a lot of Homestuck inspired aspects like like flashes. There's a 3D video game that me and
00:37:29 my brother worked on that is one of the pages of the comic. And there's a lot of gifs that sort of,
00:37:36 you know, pages that are gifs rather than just still images that make up for how shoddy the artwork
00:37:43 is. Right, right. You make it be a multimedia kind of a thing where like, suddenly this comic,
00:37:50 it's like something that couldn't exist in a book. And so it's taking advantage of being digital.
00:37:55 Yeah, I would, I think I've said before that I would think it was, I would find it really cool
00:38:07 to be because I do art myself. I'm a draw guy. I would love to be, I don't know, I would love to
00:38:14 find like some like little studio or something that needs like a dedicated artist and be like a
00:38:20 background artist or like a character artist or something. I'm not really an animator, so I don't
00:38:25 I guess I'm limited in that. But I would, that'd be really cool to just be the art guy for some
00:38:32 game that ends up being like an indie hit or something. That would be, that would be the
00:38:37 dream right there. But I've looked, I've looked on, I've looked around a little bit on websites that
00:38:43 are like, unlike job hunting websites, and I've found like studios in my area that are hiring,
00:38:49 and then, but they, none of them were looking for, the closest thing I could find was like
00:38:53 UI designers and like UI designers from mobile games. It's just not, it's just not that interesting.
00:39:04 I don't know, it doesn't sound like it is. So yeah, I mean, are you like looking at classified ads
00:39:10 and that sort of thing? I mean, this was a while ago, but I just went on, I don't know, I looked
00:39:17 on some website or something that like, like looked for studios, look for studios and like,
00:39:22 because I live in the Boston area, I look for like studios around Boston. And I think I just
00:39:25 like went to each of their websites to see, because sometimes they have like a weird hiring page.
00:39:30 Yeah, if you want to do indie games, and indie developers, I can't, I've never heard of one
00:39:38 putting out a job ad. Yeah, they almost ubiquitously hire people they've met already.
00:39:45 And yeah, they met, they meet people doing game jams, for the most like, if you, if you want to
00:39:53 start getting gigs, making video games, I think like that's actually your path forward is to
00:39:59 start doing jams and the people you work with, if they like your work, then they'll want to work with
00:40:05 you again. Oh my God, I would have to, I would have to assemble a team. I would have to assemble
00:40:13 like a jam team. And I could be the art guy. Oh, well, you have pro programming guy.
00:40:19 You could do it that way. I mean, or you could, I guess you can't do the thing that I always did,
00:40:25 which was assemble a team on site, because they don't have on site game jams anymore.
00:40:31 Yeah, but like, I presume like you go to Ludum Dare forums and they will be there will be people
00:40:38 like looking for group or whatever. I mean, hell, how big is the audience of this podcast? You could
00:40:43 send out a message there saying I want to I want to form a team for the next Ludum Dare or whatever
00:40:49 jam and send me an email. We've got you know what, I know there's a number of people in our audience
00:40:55 who are like artist types of various descriptions. You know, I hate our audience. Oh yes. But you
00:41:05 know, they can they can be harness their their work can be siphoned.
00:41:12 They can extract their surplus value. Hmm, that interesting idea. You know what, I would do it.
00:41:18 I would do a game jam. I guess I never thought of it because I'm not like a games guy specifically.
00:41:23 But I could do you know, these, you know, idiots are always looking for like, oh, I can do all
00:41:29 this other stuff, but I can't do the art. Oh, I don't know how to draw. Oh, the art is hard.
00:41:33 You know, for whatever reason.
00:41:39 You know, what's easy programming?
00:41:44 Yeah, I looked at it. I looked at it. Programming is also easy. There's a lot of text. I can't read
00:41:50 it very good. I need a visual indicator. This is like a like a weird thing that I've noticed
00:41:59 over the years. That is just I when it when it comes to a video game, at least, I love being
00:42:06 able to move in a 3D space, because oh, yeah, feels good. You press you press your button,
00:42:13 and then you instantly feel movement through an area because all of the pixels on screen
00:42:19 change at once. And I don't know, something about a 3D environment where you're moving around
00:42:25 and everything is updating constantly, you get an instant feedback. In the text
00:42:31 adventure part of Frog Fractions, I always like my brain breaks, like because you look around
00:42:37 in the spaceship, and you think, okay, here's the things I can examine. I examine each one of
00:42:43 them. And then the text has gone off screen. And because it's gone, I can't remember what it was.
00:42:48 So I have to do it again. And I just can't keep it in my head. Need that visual stimulus.
00:42:56 Well, you know what you can do, you can lean on the return key, and then every every pixel on
00:43:00 the screen just keeps moving. I just keep just in one direction. Right. That's what I'm looking
00:43:09 for in a game is the pixels move. I just need like a white noise like static image and like,
00:43:16 that's what I like. I have to say that moving through a 3D space is one of my, if not the
00:43:25 biggest pleasure I get out of games. Like just the being in a world and interacting with the
00:43:33 world in an interesting physical way. Like, I have been super stressed this year from shipping
00:43:41 a game and raising a kid and COVID basically. And so I haven't really had the mental energy to
00:43:47 pick up any new games. But I replayed the entire Tony Hawk series and the entire 3D Mario series.
00:43:56 Because those are both like, and those are both games that I love in part because they are about
00:44:01 navigating a 3D space in an interesting way. Yeah, it's just sometimes I just want to be in a
00:44:07 place. I've been playing a lot of World of Warcraft lately. And I've said before on this podcast
00:44:13 that the Warcraft sucks. The world is where it's at. And it's just so nice being in certain
00:44:22 locations and just being like, yeah, I'm turning the camera around. I'm here. This character is me,
00:44:27 and I'm just sitting down at this table in this pub in this weird dwarven district of a city. It's
00:44:33 cool. That was also my favorite part of World of Warcraft. Yeah. I got into it for a little bit.
00:44:43 And then I got turned off when I realized that, oh, I hit the end game. Now it's time to raid.
00:44:48 Now it's time to join a guild and start putting together raid teams and like, oh, I got it.
00:44:52 You mean I'm not done? You mean I have to come back and do it again? And like,
00:44:56 I couldn't. I just didn't have the wherewithal.
00:45:01 Yeah, I had a similar reaction where I hit level 60 and I was like, where do I go from here?
00:45:10 And thank God because I think I lost my job because of that game. And so like the fact that it was
00:45:20 like I didn't even kick the addiction. It just the game ejected me basically.
00:45:26 I only played it for one summer because like my friends at college were like, oh,
00:45:33 we're all going to play. This was when the Lich King came out. They were like, oh,
00:45:37 you never played Warcraft? Oh, bro. Lich King's coming out this summer. We're all going to play it.
00:45:41 We're all going to be online. We're all going to be a guild. I was like, yeah, sure. Okay. I guess.
00:45:46 And I did. And then summer ended and I was like, yeah, it's fine. I did it. I don't need any more.
00:45:54 I did dabble a little bit in game making. I made a very simple sort of turn-based RPG kind of game
00:46:04 in a Game Maker Pro, I think, like in GML, which was also a tie-in as part of like my
00:46:12 a webcomic that I was working on. And then I made, I think I would be remiss.
00:46:19 We got to talk about Endless War. I want to tell Jim a little bit about Endless War.
00:46:23 Can we do that? Yeah, of course. It was two years ago. I started working on this thing.
00:46:30 And now there's like a whole team. There's like a whole volunteer team that has taken it off my
00:46:35 hands and they're the ones developing it now. But what it is, it's called Endless War. And it is
00:46:40 a Discord bot that runs in this Discord server, which turns the server into basically an MUD,
00:46:48 like a text-based RPG kind of thing, wherein you live in this city called Slime City,
00:46:56 New Los Angeles City, aka Neo Milwaukee. And you got a mine for Slime, and you join a gang,
00:47:01 and then you engage in an endless cycle of gang warfare. You choose a team. You're a killer or
00:47:06 a rowdy, and you kill each other. And whoever's got the most slime is the most power. Watch out
00:47:14 for Slime Corp. They're ruthless capitalist dogs that'll kill you for a nickel. I don't know.
00:47:23 That was ballooned over time. At first, it was just like you do a command and you kill.
00:47:27 That's the basic skeleton. But every month of the day, you just go in the mines,
00:47:33 you just mine for slime. Well, you can fish for it too. You can also farm it. You can grow up.
00:47:39 Yeah, all right. Mines are the OG. Mines are the coolest.
00:47:44 I don't even know what the game is doing anymore. Me and my friend Crack,
00:47:49 honestly, mostly him, because he was more of a developer than me. We made it two years ago,
00:47:54 and now people that I barely know make it. And every month, I'll see an update that's like,
00:48:00 oh, yeah, we added new... Now you can sell your soul to another player and put it in a jar,
00:48:10 and they can keep the jar in their fridge. You can own a real estate. Oh, yeah, we added new
00:48:14 crops. There's new crops that you can mill for new dyes and stuff. Oh, we added a new mini-boss
00:48:19 or... I don't even know what this means. This is all in this text-based thing.
00:48:28 So this is what you do. Here's how you do the handle this. You wait till you're on your death bed
00:48:33 to maximize your anticipation and to maximize the number of weird features that these developers
00:48:41 have added. Then you play the game right before you're about to die, and you have the most amazing,
00:48:47 like, I made this awesome indie game, and now look at... 50 years ago, I made this bot,
00:48:54 and now it's moved platform six times. Now it's in VR, and I'm growing crops, and I'm hunting
00:49:02 beasts and stuff. Yeah, this is what I expected it would become one day. A 4x platformer.
00:49:10 Yeah, it's so advanced that it actually turns you immortal, and then you don't be on your death bed
00:49:17 anymore. Oh, no. That was it. That was the plan all along, to transcend the physical form.
00:49:24 And then you become one with the slime in the cloud. The slime cloud.
00:49:29 Which is definitely not the same as dying.
00:49:33 No, no, no, no. You convert your consciousness directly into slime-based cryptocurrency,
00:49:39 and then trade it on the stock market. That's what I wanted, my tombstone.
00:49:45 You feel like, oh, shit. KFC stock is rising. My consciousness is expanding. My third eyes
00:49:51 of... In the game, there's a stock market, by the way. You competing stock like Taco Bell,
00:49:59 KFC, and Pizza Hut are all... But you didn't put KFC in the game. The simulants invented it.
00:50:06 KFC was in the game, but I did not add the stock market portion. You used to just buy food from
00:50:14 KFC, believe it or not, but now it's a living dock. Now there's multiple restaurants and multiple
00:50:21 districts. The slime is... No, they want the slime. You pay them in slime, and they're like,
00:50:27 okay. You go to the mines, you mine for slime until you're too tired, and then you go to KFC,
00:50:34 you give them your slime, they give you some plutonium chicken. You eat it. You restore your
00:50:39 stamina, and then you go back to the mine, and then you just do it all over again. That's capitalism,
00:50:45 baby. It's a metaphor. It's, you know, in real life, that's horrifying, in a video game that
00:50:54 sounds delightful. It is. Exactly, exactly. Fortunately, you can't do... There's no more
00:51:03 Kavens now. We took Kavens out, so... Oh, you did? I think so. Maybe not. Maybe they're back in. Who
00:51:09 fucking knows? Remember what we said? What about Kaven mimics? You think it's a Kaven,
00:51:17 but it turns out to be a treasure chest. You trigger Kavens on purpose, but sometimes...
00:51:26 Before you notice that it's actually a treasure, you miss out on the treasure if you run away.
00:51:30 Right. I guess that's a reverse mimic. Devs, I hope you're listening. Devs, you better listen to this
00:51:36 and implement all of this right now. Put it on the to list. Yeah, you're still the project leader,
00:51:42 right? I mean, I can't make them do anything. Yeah, because it was like... I would hope that
00:51:53 my suggestions would carry at least a little weight. Right. It was a free thing. There was no
00:52:00 pay structure. I guess it's always been whoever's the coolest with the coolest ideas gets to decide
00:52:07 what happens. It's open source, and that's why... Oh, yeah. You just stole it, right? Oh, yeah.
00:52:21 Yeah, I copied it for my own copy of the thing for an adult version. Yeah, you could say.
00:52:31 You could say. Disgusting. Absolutely. Absolutely despicable. I'm glad to say. When I'm on my deathbed,
00:52:45 reading the patch notes for version 7.33.49.01 of Endless War, seeing all the new vegetables that
00:52:54 they've added, I'm glad that I'll be able to look back and say, hey, me, Endless War guy,
00:53:03 and Jim Stormdancer, Frog Fractions guy. Yeah, we rapped a little bit. We rapped a bit about video
00:53:09 games. That was the thing that happened. Definitely happened. Yeah, and here's the proof.
00:53:19 Are you working on anything right now? I know that's probably a pretty cliche question,
00:53:27 but I'm genuinely curious. What's the next video game? Can I have another video game,
00:53:34 Sarah, please? So I just patched achievements and a bunch of new secrets into the Hat DLC.
00:53:44 That was a few weeks ago. Right, right. And at this point, I can't... So it's complicated.
00:53:56 The game is not selling well enough that I can justify just launching into a new product.
00:54:03 You mean the Game of the Decade? Yeah, the Hat DLC. The Hat DLC is what I mean. It's not a game,
00:54:09 it's just a hat. Yeah, just a hat. There's nothing other than the hat. Yeah, yeah. Right. It's a very
00:54:15 nice hat. It's not selling well enough that I can justify just like, yeah, now is when I make my next
00:54:20 game. So I have to figure out what is next for me. In the meantime, I am doing contract stuff.
00:54:28 I was going to say, you do like real jobs, at least some of the time.
00:54:34 Yeah. Well, I mean, it's been ever since Frog Fractions, I've only done like...
00:54:41 And this is really neat. It's only been interesting work. It's mostly been game dev stuff,
00:54:47 but yes, I do contract work in addition to making my own video games.
00:54:56 But I've been very privileged to like, largely be working on my own games for the past eight years.
00:55:04 I don't know. I mean, stop me if you can't answer anything specific or anything. But like,
00:55:10 is it, do you do studios? Do you work for studios or is it mostly like other indie devs that like
00:55:15 contract you to work on projects? So I, it's always been indies. The biggest
00:55:24 studio that I worked for was Human Nature Studios, which was at the time making Toja
00:55:30 Mineral. And I was working on, they wanted to crowdfund a sequel to Star Flight. And so I was...
00:55:38 Star Flight, okay. Which is, if you've heard of Star Control 2...
00:55:42 I've heard of it, yeah. Yeah. Star Control 2 was the game that was like a spiritual sequel to Star
00:55:48 Flight. But so it's a game about flying around and getting in dogfights and talking to aliens
00:55:56 and exploring alien planets. It's a very like, try to do everything, space exploration game.
00:56:04 Like Star Citizen, except made in 1984 or whatever it was, in 86 maybe.
00:56:11 And I was working on, I wasn't working on the sequel, I was working on the prototype of the
00:56:19 sequel that they could film, they could screen capture to use in the trailer. So I was still...
00:56:28 Okay. I was still doing like game design work. I was still doing like interface design work.
00:56:35 But it was kind of amazing in that like, oh, if there's a bug that I...
00:56:43 If there's like a nasty bug that happens like, even as often as like half the time the players
00:56:49 run the game, yeah. It doesn't matter. Just use the footage where the bug didn't happen.
00:56:55 It's like, that's like so funny. It's must like, imagine like, you don't even have to worry about
00:57:04 bugs like as long as the game runs. Like you can make the ultimate game. Like you're freed from
00:57:10 this whole like vector of concern about like what's going to limit the kind of game you can make.
00:57:15 But alas, only for this in this context that like we'll never see a wide release because like
00:57:22 the game's broken. Right. Very, very strange. Is that like, is that like,
00:57:30 is that what, is that what Will Wright did with Spore? Do you know about, you know,
00:57:35 you know the trailer, the initial trailer for Spore that he did, the demo, you remember that?
00:57:40 I, yeah, I don't know what that was. It might have been, it might well have been a prototype in
00:57:47 the same, along the same vein. Like that was an incredibly ambitious project that they really,
00:57:54 they really cut scope on that by a huge amount in order to ship it.
00:57:59 It looked so different, the final game. And yeah, it was, I don't know, man, like some of the, some
00:58:06 of the stuff, some of this, like when he, I've complained about this before because no game
00:58:12 ever broke my heart, like Spore did. But like when he gets to the planet stage and he's like
00:58:16 finely tuning the planet's atmosphere, like, oh, the various gases in the atmosphere and the
00:58:20 temperature. And then suddenly organically, like life starts blooming on the planet. He's like,
00:58:24 oh, yes, I've tariff, the delicate control. And then you get it, you get to the real game.
00:58:28 And it's like, you just drop a fucking bomb on the planet. And like, that's how you turn it into
00:58:33 a habitable planet. And you can like put stamps on it. And that's how you just like, oh my God,
00:58:39 Will, Will, you fucker. Yeah, they were doing some some sneaky shit with that.
00:58:47 Yeah, yeah. I mean, obviously, like they were trying to make the game that Will
00:58:52 Wright wanted to make. And they were just like, well, we're like four years into development.
00:58:58 And it's nowhere to close to anything playable. Like, is my guess is what happened. So like, okay,
00:59:04 let's let's bring in the guy who made civilization to do the the turn based strategy part of it,
00:59:09 you know. Yeah. And like, they turned it into, I guess, in the same sort of way as frog fractions,
00:59:19 they turned it into a series of mini games. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, the the the different stages
00:59:29 were always going to play differently. But yeah, like the the final like the final stage like the
00:59:37 conquest of space was just so like, just so like, oh, you know, just do the same thing just like
00:59:44 move from planet to planet. Oh, and sometimes these like Borg things show up and you just got
00:59:50 to kill them and they're just like, okay, it does. Yeah. Sad. Yeah. Sad times. I'm still still
00:59:58 still hurting, still hurting over spore. I bet I bet you could get some of that same sense out of
01:00:06 like a dwarf fortress or something like a war fortress. I have played dwarf fortress not in
01:00:12 a while. I used to play it pretty often, actually. Not in not in recent years. I was a big fan. I was
01:00:24 a really big fan of just going like doing world gen and then just going into like,
01:00:28 world history and like reading. Yeah, even that's like, I think that's why I stopped playing it
01:00:33 was because I discovered that like, I kind of just like reading about the stuff more than like,
01:00:39 you know, all the rigmarole of like, okay, well, I have to mine up have to mine iron and then I
01:00:44 got to I got to refine it and just steal and I need I need pig iron and okay, I need the okay to
01:00:49 form it into like, okay, I got to make greaves, got to make helmets, got to outfit my military.
01:00:54 Okay, what kind of what color cloak did I need? I need purple helmets to dye their cloaks with
01:00:59 like, okay, I get that. You know, let me just read about read about the let me just read about
01:01:06 like the goblin who became emperor of the dwarven kingdom after like, she was created when the
01:01:14 universe began and then spent the first like 400 years of her life, like winning a hammer throwing
01:01:21 contest and wrestling matches, only to become dwarven. Like, let me just read her story.
01:01:28 Yeah, my relationship to the dwarf fortress is similar, except that what I read is people's
01:01:36 stories of playing dwarf fortress. Like, like, like, like, like, it would be in I mean this in
01:01:45 the old sense, like, like, let's play threads where people like, yes, exactly, type out type.
01:01:50 Yeah, type out what happened and screenshot and stuff. I've read some of those. What's the one?
01:01:56 What's the one with the skeleton elephants? You know that one? I don't know that one.
01:02:02 I feel like it's the one like most famous like dwarf fortress story. And it was like the
01:02:11 it was in an evil biome. And these the outside was plagued with skeleton elephants. And at one
01:02:19 point, a dwarf went outside on like an excursion and it's an elephant killed the dwarf. And this
01:02:26 dwarf was carrying like some very like, you have like a nice like artifact piece of armor or something
01:02:31 or like pants. And like, because of like the waiting algorithm, all the other dwarves immediately
01:02:38 knew that these like valuable artifact pants were, you know, ownerless. So they all rushed out like
01:02:45 into the wild like rushed for these like artifact pants. And they were all just massacred by these
01:02:51 skeleton elephants, they just kept like pouring out and just getting crushed. Yes, exactly what I
01:02:56 want to hear. And then like from then on, like whenever the dwarves carved like artifact chairs
01:03:02 and tables, they would carve like images of dwarves being crushed by elephants. It's just like
01:03:09 the worst thing that ever happened to them. It's like, where were you on the day of like elephant
01:03:14 gate or whatever? Right. Very good. That was that one's a riot. Yeah. It's skill. There's a skill
01:03:23 that you have to have. And if you play a good game of dwarf fortress, some funny shit happens.
01:03:29 But then, you know, to tell it in a compelling way to make it a funny story to read, you know,
01:03:35 there's a, oh, there's, um, there's a YouTuber called Krugsmash. Have you seen him? Not familiar
01:03:41 now. Krugsmash basically does that he he runs these fortresses and he makes videos sort of
01:03:48 sort of summarizing and explaining like how the fortress is going and like what happened.
01:03:54 Oh, there's a great and he does his own art too. Like he draws scenes from it and he'll show them
01:03:58 on screen like while he's describing them. He has a great series called monster killer. Monster
01:04:04 killer. I won't say, I'm not going to say what happens because it would be a spoiler, but the
01:04:09 fortress monster killer has a real arc to it. It has dramatic, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, what's the word?
01:04:17 Irony something I was going to say, like build up and pay off.
01:04:21 Okay. There is dramatic irony. Yes. It's got like elements are built up and then they pay off in
01:04:25 the end. Mwah. Mwah. That's a, that's a good one. Excellent. I played, um, not to go, not to go on
01:04:34 and on about dwarf fortress, but I will say I had one game that I played where, uh, a guy got killed,
01:04:40 like I think like a were lizard attack and the guy got killed and I had built these tombs
01:04:45 and a guy got killed out there and I saw this other dwarf kept running
01:04:48 from where his body was to the tombs, from where his body was to the tombs. And I was like,
01:04:53 what is this guy doing? And I looked at his relationship and it turns out that this dwarf
01:04:57 that was running was a friend of the guy who was killed outside. And what he was doing was he was
01:05:03 going, the guy had been like crushed by like a hammer to the head or something. And it had
01:05:08 shattered his head and sent his teeth flying. And this guy kept going out, finding one of his
01:05:13 teeth, bringing it into the, into the tomb and putting it in the coffin, going out, finding
01:05:17 another tooth, bringing it back and putting it in the coffin. Yeah. Yeah, I know, right? I hope
01:05:23 someone does that for me. And inevitable teeth related accident when I'm eventually bludgeoned
01:05:31 to death by a were lizard. Yeah, yeah. Well, I hope, I hope that my friends go out with a bucket
01:05:36 and like scoop up a bucket of my slime, bring it to my coffin, pour it in, go out, scoop up another
01:05:41 bucket, bring it out, pour it in. Oh boy. Well, I don't know, we've been going for an hour. Either
01:05:53 of you, I don't want to want to raise any objections, any grievances, or anything else you want to talk
01:05:59 about on this episode of the Procrastinators podcast. This has been real fun. It's been great
01:06:06 having you on. I was, I was, I was actually pretty taken aback when Jim Storm dancer himself
01:06:14 got back to me like, yeah, Cheryl, been your podcast. It's like, whoa, shit. Oh, shit. I didn't
01:06:19 think you'd say yes. What do we do? Everybody, everybody clean up, look presentable, look professional.
01:06:26 That's me. I'm always getting on podcasts. Do you do it often? Do you make appearances?
01:06:34 You know, I was expecting to get a bunch of podcast invitations after I shipped the CapDLC.
01:06:41 Nothing. You're the first. No shit. Holy shit. Wow. Well, fuck that. I know, right? Listen.
01:06:50 I mean, I guess I could have, I could have like sent out a press release or something like
01:06:54 Jim Storm dancers looking to be on a podcast. Yeah, maybe. But I mean, live and learn. Yeah.
01:07:01 Live and learn. Well, I mean, fuck that. I, I have been putting it off, but I am going to go
01:07:07 and get the DLC because I, I'm going to play it. I would encourage our audience to do it too.
01:07:13 Fucking, I just really want my, I really want my frogs to look nice and dapper and it just
01:07:18 sounds like cute and it would really enhance the experience of garden variety vanilla frog
01:07:23 fractions one for me. Yeah. In my opinion. Yes. All right, cool. Well, then let's just do,
01:07:34 do you want to, do you want to get it? You want to, you want to escape? You want to open up the
01:07:38 latch and let you, let you out? Yeah, I guess I should probably go see how my wife is doing.
01:07:44 Sure. Sure. You're a, you're a busy guy. You're a dad. Yep. Very man. Scary. Scary thoughts.
01:07:59 All right. Well, thanks again. A few moments later.
01:08:04 Ellie is all right. Cut all that out. That's fucking horseshit. Yeah. Cut all this. Cut all this.
01:08:10 If even one, if even one whisper, no, no, no, no. If even one whisper of this makes it into
01:08:17 the podcast, I will destroy you. And then, and then Ellie is our and cut the cut out what we said,
01:08:24 but then leave that part in where I say that if any of this makes into the podcast, I'll kill you
01:08:29 and then leave so that they know that they have to get the, the Patreon bonus episodes,
01:08:37 right? Give them a little, just let them know exactly what's at stake.
01:08:46 All right. Voicemails. Okay. Voicemails. You got them up? Oh, shit. I never,
01:08:52 I never remembered to do that. Speakpipe.com. It's already in the thing. All right. I'm here.
01:09:01 Wimp. Wimp. All right. Are we ready to go? Which one are we starting on?
01:09:08 We are an idea for a PCP fighter. Okay. Right on. Okay. Three, two, one, go.
01:09:16 Mugen is a free engine for 2D fighters. It has a big fan community and it's built around being
01:09:23 able to easily put your own characters and moves in. It might be a good place to start
01:09:28 for like a proof of concept for a PCP fighter. Yes. I mean, I've, I've done Mugen before.
01:09:37 I was, I was, I spent like, I don't know how long because I was an idiot kid who didn't really
01:09:44 understand what he was doing, trying to figure out how to get like an anime character. I think
01:09:52 it was like Zoro from One Piece. I wanted to get Zoro in the Mugen because I couldn't find him.
01:09:57 I tried to make him. I tried to make Sanji, I think actually. I got, I ripped some GBA Sanji
01:10:02 sprites from something and I was like working on the hitboxes and it was like, I managed to make
01:10:09 him kick and it connected and I was like, oh my God. But it was so powerful. Yeah. But I don't think
01:10:15 I ever really finished it because it was like, I don't want to do that for every single animation,
01:10:19 every single move. Yeah, fuck it. I'll just download Fat Albert.
01:10:30 You know, it's, I mean, it kind of sounds like fun. I was, I was fucking around with,
01:10:37 did I mention I was actually fucking around with some of the VTuber software? I mean,
01:10:42 I can see the appeal. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I can see the appeal of like, you know, oh, yeah,
01:10:48 take these sprites and then, yeah, I could see that it just being like a fun little thing to do.
01:10:54 When they talked about the PCP fighter idea, like, yeah, the first thing that jumped in my head
01:10:58 was like, oh, Mugen, that's kind of like, Mugen is a program that you can make like fighting games
01:11:03 and I have never used it. So I don't actually know how like, how involved it is or anything.
01:11:08 But I've seen like a, you ever watched Salty Bet? No, what's that?
01:11:13 Salty Bet is, it is a Twitch stream. I think it is, I think that's mainly what it is. It's a Twitch
01:11:21 stream that runs basically just a series of like algorithmically generated matchups of
01:11:30 Mugen characters from like a database. And I mean, you know that like some characters are just like,
01:11:37 Oh God, I saw a video recently, or maybe I read an article, I don't remember, but it was about
01:11:47 Mugen characters and how like, some of them can be designed to be invincible. But it's not like,
01:11:55 there are like tiers of invincibility. And like, the, the basic like, sure, yeah,
01:12:02 you can make a character that like has no hitbox, or like, you know,
01:12:05 has like an infinite hitbox that hits the whole screen for infinite damages in the blockable,
01:12:09 right? Like, yeah, sure, you can do that. And that's an invincible character. But there are like
01:12:14 coding tricks you can introduce into your game, into your character that make it like even more
01:12:19 invincible, like that like, will just like automatically win the match, or will like crash
01:12:24 the program or something like that. I yeah, I remember light Yagami has an animation redraws
01:12:31 in his death note. And if he finishes that animation, the other player just dies.
01:12:35 Yeah, but I'm, but I'm talking about, I'm talking, I'm talking about like characters
01:12:39 that are essentially viruses that like destroy your computer. Like that's how we crash the game.
01:12:46 Uh, I guess I don't actually understand, I really don't understand like the more technical ones.
01:12:52 But, but anyway, like, yeah, salty bed is basically matchups of sometimes it's
01:12:56 characters like these that are just like, a human could never possibly beat them.
01:13:00 But like, they get matched against each other and they're like, you don't even see what
01:13:05 know what's happening. And like, you can bet on it. I think there's like some kind of like
01:13:08 game currency that you can use to like place bets on like which of these two characters is
01:13:12 going to win. And I think it's just runs like constantly like 24 hours a day or a lot of the
01:13:18 time anyway. Yeah, salty bed if if you're ever like, it's good to like put on like a party or
01:13:23 something like if nobody knows what to watch, or like you need some background noise, you can
01:13:27 just put on salty bed and you can just be like, Oh, okay. You know, JoJo is fighting Garfield
01:13:33 and like Garfield is like, you know, good summoning like screen clearing like johns and odys that
01:13:38 are like pummeling, whatever, like, you know, you'll see some some cool shit like that. And that's
01:13:43 salty bed. All right. Yeah, make us a video game. Oh, I didn't tell Jim about the PCP dating
01:13:52 sim. I'm sure he would have been I'm sure he would have been blown away. Oh, well, next time.
01:13:58 Maybe next time. One of these days, we might have like, we could we could maybe try to orchestrate
01:14:06 like a super guest episode where we get tons of guests that we've had before. Like people who
01:14:12 would never interact normally. Like, like who? Well, like the people are old guests. Yeah, all of
01:14:19 them. Just fucking all of them at the same time. Oh, you can have like a mixer. It's like, Oh,
01:14:24 Jim Storm dancer meet aria de mezzo. Oh, cyber shell meet fit MC. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, sure.
01:14:35 Why not? So wait, I'm gonna Jim posted his audio. I'm going to give him not one but two thumbs up.
01:14:45 There you go. Excellent. Next voicemail is called. Yeah. Three, two, one, go.
01:14:55 No, no, November. No, no, November. No, no, November. No, no, November. No, no, November.
01:15:04 No, no, November. No, no, November. Yeah. Oh, it's it's not in its N and N for no, no, November.
01:15:13 We're starting. We're starting it boys. It begins.
01:15:18 That's what it appears. Everything would be destroyed. I'd be so mad if Nate came on the
01:15:26 podcast for any reason. Next one is called. Blaseball greater than greater than greater
01:15:33 than greater than greater than endless war. We'll see about that. Three, two, one, go.
01:15:41 Hey guys, I don't know if my last voicemail center not, but I'm just going to send another one
01:15:45 just in case. So like I haven't really watched the PCP in a few months, but that is irrelevant.
01:15:50 I'll catch up like eventually maybe probably, but there's this thing I found that's like really
01:15:54 fucking cool and also better than endless war. You might be like, what better than endless war?
01:15:59 That's impossible. Yeah, it's like similar, but better. It's called Blaseball. Imagine like
01:16:04 fantasy football, but it's baseball and also like hunger games and just fucking crazy shit happening
01:16:10 all the time. Dude, it's pretty awesome. Right now the game is on like a month long break,
01:16:14 but when it goes on, dude, it fucking goes on. It's so awesome and based and epic
01:16:20 Blaseball. This is, this is why like I have heard about Blaseball and I have,
01:16:28 I have keep meaning to look into it and I haven't. Same. It's, it's one of those things that's like,
01:16:33 oh, I feel like I've heard of this before, but I haven't. And it's a new thing that people are
01:16:38 going like, oh, cool. Yeah. But like, I don't, I don't, I don't really understand it out of
01:16:45 descriptions, like have not have failed to really clue me into like what it is. Oh, it's just good.
01:16:50 Man, it's just good. It's like crazy, crazy shit happens. Like,
01:16:56 is it a, I mean, people have, people have compared it to endless war. So I'm like,
01:16:59 is it a, is it an MUD? Is it an RPG? Is it text based? It's, let's Google it right now. But people
01:17:06 say that it's like fantasy football. And to be honest, I don't really even understand what fantasy
01:17:11 football is. Like the only, isn't the only thing you do in fantasy football, just like pick your
01:17:17 team and that's it. Right. Blaseball play now. I got to sign up. Fuck this. Yeah. That's what I got
01:17:24 to the homepage. I was like, I don't want to make an account. Fuck this. Wait. Blaseball is an online
01:17:30 browser baseball simulation horror game developed by the game band. Horror game.
01:17:38 Excuse me? Sploric magazine. Well, you collect, hang on. Here's polygon.com. I'm just going to
01:17:48 quickly, what is Blaseball? Blaseball is a fantasy baseball game. You can play online. You collect
01:17:52 coins by betting on games and use the coins at the end of each week to vote for decrees and
01:17:57 blessings that will change the game the next week. Okay. So like everybody, but it's like a
01:18:04 community thing, right? Like changing the way the game will play. And then they all watch,
01:18:11 I guess. I heard it compared Subway to like D&D in that like the game, the game masters are
01:18:17 basically like running like a campaign almost, but like it's sort of like behind like they're like,
01:18:24 they're doing something like they're reacting to the community in some way. And I don't really
01:18:30 know how because I don't understand how the game works. Yeah. I'm curious if this guy just said
01:18:34 it was better than Endless War because Endless War is a thing that the PCP has created.
01:18:40 And it's just a game and it's better than this game. Or if it's a similar type of game, that's
01:18:45 what I'm wondering. It sounds to me like it's similar in that it is largely like community
01:18:50 engagement driven. You know, it sounds like it sounds like, yeah, like in the same way that like,
01:19:06 I don't know, maybe there'll be a contest and someone will make an entry that's popular and
01:19:13 maybe a dev will decide to like, okay, introduce a, you know, a mechanic that is, you know, based on
01:19:18 that thing, which is a thing that's happened in Endless War, you know, maybe, I don't know. I
01:19:24 can't even speculate on what would happen in baseball without having any knowledge of the game.
01:19:30 But like, I don't know, maybe, oh, a team wins that no one expected to win. And the devs say,
01:19:38 oh, a ghost appears now. A ghost appears. Now there's a ghost, guys. There's a fucking ghost in
01:19:45 the baseball. Dude, that's just like Endless War. And the ghost becomes the coach.
01:19:56 It's exactly like it. Only better. People like saying, oh, I'm going to vote for the air strike
01:20:04 to destroy the training fields for this team so they can't practice. And it accidentally kills
01:20:10 all of the team. And now they're all ghosts. Oh, I didn't mean to do that. Oh, shit. Oh,
01:20:16 but this is good, actually. Oh, I'm glad that it happened, you say, to the machine in text format.
01:20:25 I should probably look more into baseball. I keep hearing people talking about baseball.
01:20:30 Probably shouldn't be a fucking idiot who doesn't understand anything.
01:20:33 No, that's fine. Being an idiot is good.
01:20:36 Yeah, you're right. Okay, next, next voicemail is called Timmy return and update,
01:20:42 parentheses, guy who all other voicemailers hate. Oh, it's a minute and a half. Fuck you, Timmy.
01:20:50 Three, two, one, go. Yo, it's me, Timmy back. God, I fucking hate this guy.
01:20:59 For a few months, I haven't watched the procrastinators podcast. I sent that last
01:21:07 voicemail about baseball. Any voicemail since like, I don't know, mid August, all of September.
01:21:15 I have not sent any voicemails in September. I know that for a fact. And all of October until
01:21:20 like this point. So anyone vaguely sounding like me is not me because all of the people
01:21:28 God, I hate it when voicemailers get all protective about their identity.
01:21:33 So I get why it's hard to tell when it's tiny, Timmy, or when it's not Timmy, you are, you're
01:21:39 a nothing submission. Okay, man, I am, I'm not afraid of any of you. Okay, Timmy for voice jail.
01:21:50 Timmy for voice jail. He's in it. No, I'll send him to the fucking gulag. All right.
01:21:55 Bang, bang, bang, bang the gavel. No more. It's over. It's over. Goodbye, Timmy. Take him away,
01:22:00 boys. Get him in there. Yeah, fucking, we got an empty cell. You know, exactly what to do with you.
01:22:11 Feels good. Feels good. Yeah, Timmy return an update. Like, was that just an update?
01:22:18 It's just to let you know that Timmy is back.
01:22:24 Like no content, just an update. It's just, it's like an update video. It's so annoying.
01:22:29 Hey guys, no, it's literally, hey guys, sorry I haven't made a voicemail in a while.
01:22:35 That's literally what it is.
01:22:42 I'm gonna die.
01:22:48 Oh, good times.
01:22:55 Next voicemail is called, oh fuck you, Timmy. Next voicemail is called Why Ben Why.
01:23:01 I hope this is Timmy saying why did you send me to voice jail. Okay, three, two, one, go.
01:23:09 Ben, your arguments in favor of circumcision are junk signs that have been debunked for at
01:23:15 least a decade and a half, probably much longer than that. The quote unquote health benefits
01:23:22 to circumcision are not. Basically, the hygienic thing about it is easily prevented by just
01:23:33 washing your fucking dick like any sensible person would do. And the prevention of the spread of
01:23:43 SCDs is a minuscule amount that is far surpassed by the much more common and widely society already
01:23:55 adopted practice of wearing a fucking condom. So in closing, don't push for circumcision because
01:24:05 all of the quote unquote benefits of it are not. They're up. And it is a moral wrong to do it because
01:24:16 you're not gaining anything. Okay, listen. The awkward thing here is that there's a period
01:24:26 of, there's a period of like five days between like the episode, like we record and the episode
01:24:34 comes out, we're in like, we've already answered questions, but the audience hasn't heard us answer
01:24:38 the questions. So sometimes we'll get a voicemail about the same thing two weeks in a row because
01:24:43 it fell in that period. It's unfortunate. I already answered this last weekend, but I'll say it again.
01:24:48 My argument is not, we should ban, we should circumcise because these things, I was merely
01:24:53 saying that if the data suggests that these benefits occur, they're worth considering and
01:24:58 weighing against the negatives of circumcision, which really seemed to be pretty minuscule as
01:25:02 well. You say the benefits are minuscule, well seems like the downsides are minuscule and that's
01:25:07 fine. The other thing, if it's junk science, then so be it. I just need to be convinced that it's
01:25:13 junk science and maybe it, I don't know, maybe it is. And then the other thing, okay, I hate this,
01:25:18 I hate this argument that like, well, yeah, it doesn't matter that it's more hygienic because
01:25:24 all you have to do is wash your dick. Well, like, sure. Okay, sure. It's fine for you to,
01:25:29 I don't know. I don't know, man. I almost feel like, sorry if this is like too, sorry if this is
01:25:37 like too, if this is sort of like God winning the argument a little bit, but I almost feel like
01:25:43 that's the same argument as saying like, well, it shouldn't matter if the police are racist,
01:25:48 because like, if the, if black people just didn't commit crimes, all they have to do is not commit
01:25:52 crime and then we'll get arrested. It's like, it's sort of missing the point. Like, it kind of
01:25:57 doesn't matter. Like, oh, you could prevent, you could prevent hygienic issues if you just
01:26:01 wash your dick. Well, no shit, right? But like, it kind of doesn't matter. Cause like,
01:26:06 I would be more interested in just, in looking at a, at like data, like, all right,
01:26:11 if everybody perfectly washed their dick all the time, then there would be no hygienic issues.
01:26:16 Yeah. Theoretically, the issues of like infection of one's dick should be zero,
01:26:20 but guess what? It's not, it's going to happen. So in a population that is circumcised are the
01:26:25 levels of those things higher or lower. That's all I would need to, that's all I would want to know.
01:26:29 Like, I'm concerned about the data, not the like, oh, well it doesn't, the data doesn't
01:26:33 matter because everyone just needs to do X. They're not going to do X. They never do.
01:26:39 Fuck you, voicemail. Yeah, whatever. I've set my piece on this. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
01:26:49 Cool. Next one up. Billy the Bard, 11th, 3, 2, 1, go.
01:27:19 Fuck you. Fuck you. Because he's, because he's dead.
01:27:26 This son of tears of pain will never dry.
01:27:36 Very nice. Very nice. Very nice. Uh, you know, uh, that samurai, dang.
01:27:44 Can't believe, can't believe someone would betray him and make him commit sepaku like that.
01:27:48 Like, that's so fucked up. But what are you going to do? You know, human nature, I guess,
01:27:54 or something. It's just, damn. If only there could have been another way.
01:28:02 But we don't live in a perfect world. It's good to remember. Never forget. Never forget samurai
01:28:08 son. There's a, in the sky behind me, there's like a cloud and it looks like him and he's
01:28:14 giving the thumbs up. It's like, he's, you know, he's giving the finger. He's giving me the finger.
01:28:18 Like, fuck you, Beno santo son. Goodbye, Ogozaimasu. Goodbye, Ogozaimasu.
01:28:27 Oh, yes. Good. Good. Next one. Logo is sentimental. Otherwise, upgrade it, y'all. Artists, come on. Oh,
01:28:38 I bet I know what this is about. It's probably about the fact that our logo is TPC. I was looking,
01:28:43 I was thinking the exact same thing this week. I was looking at the logo. It's like, why don't
01:28:47 we just change it to be PCP? It's stupid. Nobody calls it TPC. That's all right. Yeah. Is this only
01:28:55 zero seconds long? Yeah, it's just the sound of a click. Okay. Well, like, it doesn't matter.
01:29:02 Because yeah, I agree. We should change the logo. It should say PCP. We're called the PCB,
01:29:08 where the progress news podcast. We should have done it years ago, Lamal. We're stupid. That's why.
01:29:16 Yeah. No, no, it's really just because I don't, I don't know how it would, like,
01:29:24 we have to Photoshop it. And I don't have the file. I don't think I was like, do we want it to,
01:29:31 like, this would be an opportunity to revamp the logo entirely, not change the letter. But
01:29:37 I don't know what it, I don't, that's a lot of work. It's true. Yeah, because we don't have,
01:29:41 like, Davoo's original file to edit or whatever. I mean, we could, I could edit it well enough
01:29:48 that it would essentially just be the same logo, but with the, like, I could do it. On the other
01:29:52 hand, I mean, I've been thinking of, like, changing the banner and changing it, because, like, we've
01:29:56 undeniably entered a new era. You know, the cast has rotated. I was thinking, I was thinking of
01:30:02 doing some branding changes anyway. Just because why not? It's not exactly the same show as it used
01:30:09 to be. No. It's the new, it's, you know, the bold new PCP for the, for a bold new future,
01:30:15 bold new era. I don't know, just something I was thinking about. Next up, harassed porn artist.
01:30:25 Three, two, one, go. So despite what you might think and the attitude around it,
01:30:31 like, people actually believe in, like, the real, no, not November thing,
01:30:34 are actually trying to, like, stop all porn. Thoughts?
01:30:40 Um, what does he mean by the, despite what you might think with the attitude around it?
01:30:47 I don't know, I don't know exactly what that means.
01:30:49 I think it's, it's just like, despite what you may believe, people actually think no,
01:30:56 November is important and not just a funny joke that you can try if you feel like,
01:31:03 like, like not, not nothing is, is, is not a, like, nothing in November. It's not a crime.
01:31:11 And like, I don't, I guess people feel like, I've not, I've not heard any of this,
01:31:17 like people trying to stop porn. I mean, I know that there are people that believe in,
01:31:22 like, the nofap lifestyle. Right. And I guess I think, like, that's, if you want to do that,
01:31:29 and like, maybe you think you're happier not doing it, makes you more productive or whatever,
01:31:34 then like, yeah, sure. You know, as, as with everything, I draw the line, like, well, you
01:31:39 know, who are you, who are you to say other people can't do it? Who are you to say people
01:31:43 shouldn't make porn? I mean, from the name of this voicemail, I assume this is a guy who makes porn
01:31:50 or girl or makes porn of someone who has been harassed because they are a porn artist. I can,
01:31:55 I can definitely see that happening on Twitter or something. Nofap people are fucking,
01:32:01 you know, despite, I don't know, I just said they're fine. I'm sure a lot of them are a lot,
01:32:06 by and large, they seem like some real degenerates. They seem like freaks, honestly.
01:32:13 I mean, I would assume, like, religious, like it comes from a religious place.
01:32:19 Yeah, like, like, Ruth V, I think, is a, is a nofaper, and he's fucking terrible.
01:32:27 It's, yeah, it's these, yeah, it's a very like, um, yeah, very like conservative. Nofap before marriage.
01:32:35 Yeah, it's people that are like, it's people that are like, people that are like, like,
01:32:42 I don't know, like post-Christian, like, like weird traditionalists. I don't know.
01:32:48 It doesn't seem like a, again, like whatever, I'm sure people do it for all kinds of reasons,
01:32:53 but like, the community, the community seems bad. I've heard, um, examples of people who are like,
01:33:03 um, I do the nofap because when I finally do fap afterwards, it feels like so much better, dude.
01:33:08 So much calm. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, my balls just span to unbelievable sizes and I can't
01:33:14 move. And then I just let it all out all over my room. And it's like, okay, you know, if you want to
01:33:21 do that, that's all right. That's pretty good. The people who are like, the people who are like,
01:33:28 porn is bad. I don't really come across them. Um, not really come across porn artists getting
01:33:34 harassed, but I guess it would be through DMs. So I don't know. Yeah. But all this makes me want to
01:33:41 do is to draw more porn. I need to get back to doing that.
01:33:47 Yeah, fuck yeah. Not in November. Not November. Not November. Yeah, if you want.
01:33:55 Oh, wait, this is the start of find purpose November. Remember?
01:33:59 The first loser find purpose November. Who is going to be who is going to be the first loser
01:34:04 of find purpose November and then buy the shirt?
01:34:08 Wait, do we have a shirt? Yeah, we have. Yeah, I made the shirt as soon as we did that episode.
01:34:13 Oh, I had never seen it. No, you didn't. It's got a nice like font and stuff.
01:34:20 Eleazar show the shirt. Wait, I'm gonna. Yeah, get a link. I do really like the whole,
01:34:28 you know, the idea that of the of the silly things traditions we have created find purpose
01:34:34 November is a really funny one. That's actually nice. We
01:34:41 how do you how do you lose it? How do you lose the challenge to find purpose?
01:34:50 I put in the general, I probably should have put it in editor links, but
01:34:54 Oh, first of all, it's a shirt specifically about losing find purpose November. It's like,
01:34:59 hey, guys, I was the first loser of find purpose November available only available only on a fucking
01:35:08 teespring.com slash stores slash the procrastinators with dashes,
01:35:14 like the dash pro dash procrastinators. That's our storefront. Okay, mystery solved. That's where
01:35:21 you get that. But, you know, this this November, either here's what you do either at the end of
01:35:31 November, you call in and tell us how you found purpose, or you buy the shirt.
01:35:38 That's those are your those are your two options. Yes.
01:35:43 Um, next one. Oh my god, this one's going to be this is exciting. This next one is called
01:35:50 Biden as a by e d o n versus drum. So that's that's going to be good. All right, three, two, one, go.
01:36:02 So since you guys record this on Sunday, and it usually comes out on Friday, by the time this
01:36:08 episode you're recording right now is going to come out, the election might be over and someone
01:36:15 would have won. So who do you think is going to win guys? Oh, God, when when does the election
01:36:21 happen? Also, should we do a heckles for shackles during it? Oh my god. We could. Do you want to?
01:36:30 I mean, I wouldn't mind. I was might be fun. I mean, I was thinking about something I've had before.
01:36:37 Yeah. You know what? I'm down. I'm down for it.
01:36:44 I was like, I rattled around the idea of like, doing a stream of my own, you know, because I
01:36:50 I used to stream like month. Oh, God, it's been so long since I streamed. I didn't mean to not do
01:36:55 it for this long. But um, yeah, I used to do I was thinking like, Oh, should I stream during the
01:37:00 election? Like other people, other streamers are going to be doing a stream during the election.
01:37:04 But I don't know. I thought I think I thought it would just be stressful and I wouldn't enjoy it
01:37:09 very much. So I wasn't going to. But as a shackles for heckles thing, I think it could be fun. So
01:37:16 I don't know. Maybe by the time you're listening to this, that will have all already happened.
01:37:22 Perhaps. Yeah. So did this guy ask who do we think is going to win? Yeah.
01:37:27 Yeah. What do you think, Ben? I mean, I might my my one is of
01:37:34 general pessimism, because people saying Biden's ahead in the polls, which is exactly what was
01:37:39 happening with Hillary. And there's this, there's the there's a precedent for like Trump voters to
01:37:45 not say openly that they are Trump supporters, because they get, you know, like yell that.
01:37:50 So like, I'll just wait. Yeah, I'll wait until I'm in the polling booth. And then it'll turn out
01:37:54 that Trump has won by the same margin. I would I would assume just just enough.
01:38:01 It well. Yeah, I mean, it's not impossible. I will say I have looked at the numbers. I have
01:38:09 heard analysis. Biden is I mean, according to polls, Biden is ahead by much by significantly
01:38:19 more than Clinton was. And like, yes, the polls did the polls did over indicate Clinton support.
01:38:28 If polls this time overestimated Biden support by the same amount, Biden would still comfortably
01:38:34 win. I am more concerned. I think that it is very likely. I mean, Biden is basically guaranteed
01:38:42 to win the popular vote by the the polls all indicate that even given a pretty significant
01:38:48 margin of error, Biden is going to win the Electoral College too. It is nevertheless
01:38:57 possible that given that like, you know, Trump does overperform relative to polls like he did
01:39:04 in 2016, maybe there's some maybe the the amount would be even greater because of like these so
01:39:09 called shy Trump voters, maybe and then like on top of it, like Trump doing some shenanigans with
01:39:17 the like, because you know, early voting and like mail in voting, you know, the Republicans
01:39:23 really, really want they are doing everything in their power to like disqualify polls or ballots
01:39:30 that were sent on time but arrived late. Like if you sent it before the third, but it doesn't arrive
01:39:37 until you know, after that, they they really want to like, get fucking judicial ruling saying like,
01:39:43 no, these aren't allowed. And I mean, which is like not right, but they want to do it anyway.
01:39:50 And it's possible that some chicanery like that could maybe tilt it enough that maybe Trump would
01:39:57 steal it. Or even if it doesn't technically that like there's enough uncertainty introduced that
01:40:04 Trump can just kind of declare victory. And because like the public is not entirely clear on the
01:40:10 situation, they would just accept it, which is basically what happened with with Gore and Bush.
01:40:15 I could imagine like, Oh, there's we're not sure. So it's like, and he Trump would be like,
01:40:22 they tampered with it, not really specifying who just saying, you know, it's it's a it's a fake
01:40:28 election. Yeah, he's been saying that he's been priming people for that idea, like, all year.
01:40:36 He keeps he keeps questioning like the validity of mail in ballots and stuff. And it's all it's all
01:40:42 it's all a production. The numbers just don't bear it out. But, you know, this is this is the
01:40:51 idea introduce and introduce enough uncertainty into the election and into the validity of
01:40:57 votes that you can just kind of like waffle enough you have enough leeway to be like,
01:41:04 you know, I think I kind of win actually. And then, you know, stack the Supreme Court with
01:41:09 justices that will rule in your favor, which is what just happened with Amy Coney Barrett.
01:41:15 And, you know, get yourself appointed fucking another one, even though you didn't win. So
01:41:22 will Trump win? I sincerely doubt it. Will Trump like legislate himself into a coup?
01:41:28 I think that's much more likely. I think that's much more likely. And I'm concerned.
01:41:34 Hopefully. I mean, hopefully this is all sounds like fear mongering in the near future. And it
01:41:40 doesn't actually happen. And I just sound silly. Many people are saying this, though. I'm not I'm
01:41:46 not the only one speculating about this sort of thing happening. His rhetoric supports that this
01:41:54 is the plan. I guess you the viewer will already know if you put a gun to my head.
01:42:02 And you said what's going to happen? I would say, I think probably Biden will just win and Trump
01:42:08 will leave. But I'm not like super confident that that's what's going to happen. But I think that's
01:42:15 more likely than any other outcome. So fingers crossed, I guess, fingers crossed.
01:42:21 Ah, next voicemail is called Socialist Shinobi. Three, two, one, go.
01:42:36 I'm waiting for it.
01:42:39 There it is.
01:42:41 Oh, God.
01:42:59 Thank you. Many people are saying the proposition.
01:43:11 Oh, no, does he not know that he's dead?
01:43:18 Socialist samurai, of course, has any good socialists knows all must do their part to help
01:43:26 the community prosper. This is why I ask you to share resources with me in return. I would only
01:43:33 ask for the Kawasaki clan scroll. I think it is a most fair trade. I have an answer.
01:43:40 Please consider my offer honourable Ben St. Tsang. Socialist samurai. And until next time.
01:43:49 Oh, that's his fit.
01:43:54 Let's hear it. Yo, I love it. Every time, every gets me every time. Socialist samurai,
01:44:00 this is proof that socialism just doesn't work, because clearly your publicly funded
01:44:06 postal service failed to deliver to you the parcel, the letter, the postage informing you
01:44:14 of Samurai Sama's recent seppuku. He got the scroll. I'm afraid you're going to have to dig
01:44:22 the scroll up from his cold grave, sir.
01:44:32 Nerd fucking nerd fucking commies, commie bitch.
01:44:38 Hey, thanks. Thanks. You know what? Thanks for the offer, though. Thanks. Thanks for the offer.
01:44:42 Next voicemail is from Liam. Three, two, one, go.
01:44:56 Hello. Am I going? Okay, this is nice. I was on earlier. A long time ago, you probably won't
01:45:04 remember. I was very tired and I was saying very dumb things. You made a joke about it being the
01:45:10 worst voice call you'd ever heard. Ben, I believe? Probably. Anywho, hello. My name is Liam. I'm
01:45:20 making a funny cool comic. Ben, I'm surprised you made it as far as you did. I find it difficult
01:45:28 to make a comic instead of just making normal art. I do thoroughly enjoy what's it called,
01:45:36 the vapors. I do enjoy that. Good aesthetic is good for you. And it's depressing and funny,
01:45:43 you know, in a quaint way. My brain is too small to really compliment it beyond that.
01:45:49 I'm sorry. It's terrible. I guess that's all. Also, I have been liking the newer episodes.
01:46:00 I really liked the one with the sheriff lady. She's really cool, I guess. I think that was really
01:46:06 cool. Chow. Chow. That was a phone call. That was a message. That was a voice. That was a literal
01:46:16 as a phone message. I think it's interesting that you say that you, I think a lot of people
01:46:23 feel like this, that it's easier to just like draw a picture than it is to draw a comic.
01:46:28 It's easier to draw a comic because when I'm drawing a picture, I'm like, I don't know why
01:46:34 they would be here or what they're doing. I need context. I need context for them to have a pose.
01:46:42 I feel a little similarly. Yeah, yeah. When you're drawing a comic, like, you know, the moment to
01:46:47 moment, like what you're seeing is, yeah, it's motivated. Like, you know what just happened,
01:46:51 and then you're like, okay, what happens next? Oh, it's this. So yeah, in that sense, I agree. But
01:46:57 also, in terms of like, because I assume it's a matter of motivation, right? It's like, I feel
01:47:04 less motivated to just draw like a single image, because it's like, I don't know, I feel like,
01:47:11 I feel like what's the point? I don't know what I, I don't, it would be hard. It's hard for me to,
01:47:17 to imagine like, or not to imagine, but to like, I don't know, I think about this like, man,
01:47:24 artists on the internet, they'll just like, draw something that like, looks good. And then just
01:47:30 like, post it. Yeah, just because it just because it looks good. And I'm like,
01:47:35 then they sell, they sell stickers of it, and, and posters, and, and for me, I'm like,
01:47:43 if I'm doing that, I'm like, sure, I mean, I guess I could try to like, draw something that looks
01:47:47 good. But like, who cares if it looks good? Like, what's, what does it matter? You know?
01:47:54 I, I feel, yeah, I know what you mean. It's, it's, it's like, what, to what end as this picture,
01:48:03 like, what, what is purpose does this picture serve? The picture has to have, whatever it is,
01:48:08 it has to have narrative stakes. There has, there has to be some kind of narrative to it. Like,
01:48:13 um, when I, I guess an exception would be like, after I did the Nuzlocke Conquest, I drew the
01:48:17 picture of like, you know, my remaining Pokemon, like on the throne of Alola or whatever. That
01:48:24 was like, okay, I mean, that's, that's just me drawing a picture, but like, I'm drawing it because
01:48:28 it is like a narrative continuation of the, the video. It's a narrative climax. It's a, it's an
01:48:33 ethalogue or something. Yeah, exactly. That's, it's part of a story. Comics, drawing a comic sort
01:48:40 of has that inherently. And I think that makes it easier, at least for me to be motivated to want
01:48:45 to make one. I mean, technically it's harder because like, there's more drawing involved in a comic
01:48:52 technically. Uh, but yeah. Oh, that's how I feel about that. Like single images that like,
01:49:00 the, the bar needs to be a lot, is a, is a lot higher for a single image if you're just drawing
01:49:04 illustrations of stuff. When it comes to like, porn, for example, um, it's, it, you can't really get
01:49:12 away with having shit art if it's just a single image. Yeah. In a comic, you can get away with all
01:49:18 kinds of horseshit. You can get away with it. Most of your, most of your art can just be bad.
01:49:23 Most of your art can suck as long as the, the progression of something is like interesting
01:49:27 in whatever way it is. It's the story that gets people. I think that the whole thing with images
01:49:32 is that they imply a story that people will be like, Oh yeah. You know, like a, you know,
01:49:38 beautiful landscape photograph makes you think of like places you've been that are like that.
01:49:43 And so there's sort of an implicit story, like inherit in the beauty of the image.
01:49:48 Yeah. And if you don't have all that beauty, you need to, to start at point A and end up point B.
01:49:53 There's um, you know, there's a, there's a thing. Some, some people, some people are artists and
01:50:04 they just have OCs and all they do is they just draw, they just draw their OCs. Like sometimes
01:50:10 they'll be doing something or wearing something or maybe interacting with some of their other OCs or
01:50:15 whatever, you know, but it's just images and there's like no actual story to it. Well, I think
01:50:22 there is. They draw, I know people like that. They have like a long list of traits that the
01:50:30 character has and the things they would say and do the likes and dislikes and backstory.
01:50:36 Well, usually. Yeah. Yeah. Well, the, I mean, the backstory stuff is like,
01:50:43 sure. I mean, I don't know if that really counts. I mean, I think that, I think that images do imply
01:50:50 a story in a way like, I don't know, you can, you can get an idea of who this character is by like
01:50:56 the images. But well, I guess I think it's, it's a mixed bag is what I was going to say was like,
01:51:03 I think on the one hand, a lot of these people probably think about like, oh, I have these OCs.
01:51:08 I would love to make a comic about them someday, but oh, that's so hard or whatever. Like, oh,
01:51:12 there'd be so much work or I don't have time. And like, and I think a lot of them probably think,
01:51:18 or I think a lot of people might think that like, okay, a comic or a cartoon would be like
01:51:23 the ultimate expression of these characters, like that's what they should be for. But I also think
01:51:29 that maybe some characters might, there might not need to be any more to them than just what
01:51:36 they look like, or even just like the character traits suggested by these like snapshots, like
01:51:42 maybe that's the appeal, maybe, maybe they can feel it on their own. Yeah, it depends on the
01:51:49 character and depends on the artist, I think, but I don't think there's anything like wrong with that
01:51:53 either. So like, I don't know, I mean, it's not everything I'm doing that's not everything,
01:51:59 not everything needs to be a comic, I guess, you know, not every character needs to be elaborated upon.
01:52:08 But they, but they can be. And that's also nice.
01:52:16 Liam sent another voicemail that's nine seconds long. Let's let's see what that's about. Three,
01:52:20 two, one, go. Oh, also, I did want to say thank you for the brick and RCQ. That was very funny.
01:52:29 Oh, it's that Liam.
01:52:34 Huh? I don't know. I was, oh, okay. I know this guy, this guy, he's an art, he's a fucking rowdy.
01:52:43 He, I was, I was giving a princeps rewards from the contest or from the last two contests,
01:52:52 I think, the other day. And I was giving out, you know, I was making them and I was typing
01:52:56 them up and I was handing them out to the people that won them. And Liam was there and he was just
01:53:01 like, conjure a brick, because I kept like conjuring these items out of text commands.
01:53:08 And so I just created a new princep forum that was called a brick and its description was a brick.
01:53:14 And I gave to him. And now he has this like, fairly powerful, like you'd like game like
01:53:20 world unique item, which no one else has anything else. No one else has the same item. And it's,
01:53:26 it's just a brick and he's got it. And Kip, another player was like, I want the brick. Oh, I could,
01:53:32 I could max my stats with that brick. And I was like, sorry, buddy. There's only one.
01:53:39 That's fun. It was very funny. Like the, the rarity thing. If there's only one of something,
01:53:45 doesn't matter what it is, people want it. Jim Stormdancer would have been fully sold,
01:53:51 even more sold on Endless War, if I'd told him that it had a brick in it.
01:53:54 That would have been. It had a the brick or a brick. It had a brick. Yeah. Yeah.
01:54:03 Next one is called fuck Margar. And I think we can all agree with that. Three, two, one, go.
01:54:11 Hey guys, fuck Dibuster here. As one of the few remaining members of voice jail,
01:54:15 I just want to say that my cellmate Margar is really getting on my nerves with all these
01:54:19 voicemails he's sending in while I'm trying to sleep. Once the voice jail is fully defunded,
01:54:24 I was wondering if we could open up a privately owned voice maximum security prison just for him.
01:54:29 Thanks for considering. Man, really feeling that gap between recording and releasing
01:54:35 right now. This guy, this guy must not have known at the time. Margar is fucking dead.
01:54:42 Wait, what was he asking for? Maximum security prison, PC maximum security prison.
01:54:50 For Margar? Yeah. Well, I guess we should send Timmy there instead,
01:54:58 in his place, because somebody's got to go. Yeah, we can't build a jail and not put anybody in it.
01:55:03 Yeah. So we'll send Timmy to solitary confinement. We'll lock him up. We'll
01:55:08 straightjack him, put him in a dank hole. Just for you, buddy. A fuck Dibuster. Dab.
01:55:20 Next up is Agent E. Three, two, one, go. Hi. This message is with Ben. I asked that you destroy
01:55:29 this message after listening, but we both know that you will not do that. I am Agent E. That is
01:55:37 all that I can tell you now. Currently, I am in possession of two things that I think that you
01:55:44 might desire, Ben. One of which is the Necronomicon, and the other is the lifeless corpse of SummerEye
01:55:52 Summer. Also, Mr. T is here. Yo, Ben, you damn fool. I ain't no one old gag from episode 225.
01:56:03 I was in on this scheme the whole dang time.
01:56:09 Do you see it, Ben? Your downfall is near. You might have survived phase one,
01:56:16 but did you really think that the death of your supposed sensei would be the end? Ben,
01:56:22 you never had a SummerEye master. They were memories that our organization implanted in your
01:56:30 mind, and now, Ben, phase two begins. But until next time, sayonara.
01:56:48 This is like your sonichu and this guy's Christian drawing your life.
01:56:53 But I'm like their sonichu and they're my Christian. They're creating my story.
01:57:01 This is my story and nothing less.
01:57:11 I don't know what the E stands for. What did I do? What did I do to deserve this? This hell.
01:57:18 I can't believe the government, or whatever shadow organization,
01:57:24 was using their freaking schizophrenia machine to send me voices in my head of the SummerEye.
01:57:30 Why could I hear them as well? Am I a figment of your imagination?
01:57:34 I mean, maybe they just widened the signal beam a little bit and just got us all a little bit.
01:57:40 Just sent it through all the pipes. It's easy.
01:57:44 They have resources. Well, listen, the necronomicon, I would like it.
01:57:54 Hey, actually, socialist shinobi. Can we work out a deal with this? Give me that.
01:58:03 Do a slice, do an aeido slice, and cut Agent E's arm off with the necronomicon in it so it
01:58:09 drops and I like catch it and I go, yeah, thumbs up. That'd be pretty nice. That'd be pretty cool.
01:58:14 I don't care about Samurai's corpse. And then retrieve the arm as well.
01:58:19 And then one might say, one might speculate about if one were to do such a thing, what might occur.
01:58:28 All right, moving on. Next one is Laggars. 3, 2, 1, go.
01:58:58 Yeah, bro. It's cool. It's social. And we're like, yep. And the conversation ends.
01:59:04 It's a typical, hi, hi, how are you? Fine. And that's it. So my question is,
01:59:11 how do I make enduring conversation with other people, where I talk and the other person replies
01:59:17 and so on. And in general, when I'm with other people, what can I do that is fun and engaging
01:59:22 because I always freeze. I try to open a chat or something and I never know how to
01:59:27 start or what can I say to someone else? If somebody says, like, oh yeah,
01:59:33 George, you've won the first half of the battle. You are both into the same thing.
01:59:38 After that, you just have to ask them questions about what is their favorite character? What
01:59:41 do you like in the thing? Just ask them questions about the thing. The conversation can easily go
01:59:47 from there. That's like a basic strategy. I think I would agree. I would add that
01:59:55 most people really just want to talk about themselves. So yeah, if there's something
02:00:02 they're interested in, like genuinely they're interested in it, and you ask them anything
02:00:08 about it, you just let them talk. Let them talk about a thing that they're interested in. Most
02:00:18 people are just waiting for an opportunity to do that, right?
02:00:24 Take a list, take a leaf out of tierlist.com. You know all those tier lists about what's
02:00:31 your favorite cereal? Just ask people what is their favorite generic thing, usually food,
02:00:36 and that'll get them like, oh, I like this thing. I like this brand of fruit juice.
02:00:43 It's a good one. This is my favorite soda. Oh, really? Well, I like this.
02:00:47 People like filling out those tier lists for a reason, and they like talking about them and
02:00:51 arguing with people about them. So that's an aspect of just generic conversation starter stuff
02:00:59 if you don't really know what to talk about. I mean, if the conversation stops and they're not...
02:01:07 I mean, I guess I would say if you want to keep it going, then I guess you need to offer something
02:01:14 that's like, okay, well, you know, my favorite episode was this or whatever, and hopefully that
02:01:21 would prompt, like, okay, well, yeah, I like that one too, or like, no, no, my favorite episode is
02:01:26 this one, and you can talk about why or whatever. And if it grinds to a halt, then I guess I would
02:01:31 assume that like, I don't know, could be any number of reasons might be that maybe they're,
02:01:36 I don't know, maybe they're not even that interested. Maybe they just said they were
02:01:39 interested in it because... I think, yeah, there's times where they could be pretending to be
02:01:45 interested because they want to be polite. They could be interested legitimately and just also
02:01:51 terrible at speaking, in which case you have to carry the conversation, which is a bit exhausting
02:01:56 sometimes, but you know, you do what you gotta do. Do what you gotta do? Do what you... That's,
02:02:03 that's like ours. That's how that's what it is. You just gotta do what you gotta do.
02:02:08 You know, whatever it takes, do whatever it takes. Never, never, never, never relent.
02:02:14 Don't let society tell you. Don't let society put you in a box. All right, you gotta, you gotta
02:02:20 follow your dreams with a vengeance. All right, and if, and if, and if people try and stop you,
02:02:25 you gotta make them pay, right? You gotta show them. You gotta show them all.
02:02:32 What are that? I've got a mission. I got a mission for you. DM me. I'm gonna send you on a mission.
02:02:40 Don't tell anyone. Okay. Next up, we really be circumventing the crux of circumcision.
02:02:49 Three, two, one, go. Okay. So firstly, circumcisions can still be botched and that like
02:02:56 sucks for the people who that happens to. Even if everything else is neutral, there's no reason to
02:03:02 like take that risk. Also, people are quick to dismiss like the suffering of the child,
02:03:08 because like, oh, you know, you won't remember it, but it's like...
02:03:12 Yeah, it's still doesn't matter really. Like they're still paid. You're still chopping up their
02:03:16 dick without an aesthetic. Why is that what we think is like the first experience of being alive
02:03:23 in the world is, is that they get their dick chopped up? Like, you know, that's just, it just
02:03:29 doesn't seem nice. That's just doesn't mean. It seems what if some, what if you, why do we give
02:03:38 our babies vaccines that shouldn't be a baby's first memory is getting a needle stuck in it?
02:03:42 Like, shut up. God, like... Needles don't feel like anything though.
02:03:47 They hurt. Not really. Well, maybe when you're really small.
02:03:52 I just, man, I like, I'm willing to be persuaded. I just, I hate bad arguments. Like,
02:03:57 I don't even think, you know, I'm, I'm not genuine. I'm again, I'm not genuinely out here being like,
02:04:03 no guys, we need to keep circumcising. Like I'm, I'm not committed to that position.
02:04:07 But all the arguments in favour of it suck. I don't know, like, give me a good one, please.
02:04:15 What was the first, what was the first thing that he said? I'm gonna replay the very first
02:04:23 still be botched. Okay, okay. Yeah. Okay. And yeah, if, if, if there is, let's in a
02:04:30 situ, in a situation where like the data suggests that there is no benefit at all to it,
02:04:35 then yeah, probably the, the pain, which I think is pretty minor, like you're a baby, whatever,
02:04:41 like the pain and the, and the possibility of it. The possibility of the botching. Yeah.
02:04:48 Against nothing, against no benefit at all. Then I would absolutely agree. Yeah. No, then
02:04:54 probably we shouldn't do it. But like, there's not zero benefit. There's not.
02:04:58 I guess I would like to know what happens when an uncircumcised, no, when a circumcised person
02:05:04 never washes their dick, does it get stinky? You know, is it, is it, is it prone?
02:05:10 Probably less so, but yes. Because like, probably yes, but not as much. Right. It's really just
02:05:15 the not as much thing. I really feel like unless there's something major, it's pretty negligible
02:05:24 one way or the other. I just like how I am. So I like, I am in favour of uncircumcised.
02:05:30 Well, I mean, let me just, let me just pose you a hypothetical counterfactual here. Imagine,
02:05:35 imagine I showed you some data, and this is hypothetical, I don't know what the data is,
02:05:40 but imagine I showed you some credible data that suggests that like, okay,
02:05:45 in a week, you know, one in a million circumcisions is botched, and the penis is destroyed. And it's
02:05:53 like, okay, that seems bad. But then I say, okay, well, among people who are not circumcised,
02:06:00 one in a million will contract a penile infection that will require their penis to be amputated.
02:06:05 Right. Not like, it's not common. And it's the rare individual who doesn't wash their dick enough
02:06:12 to cause this to happen. So like, it's still rare. But like, those are two, those are two,
02:06:19 like, pretty marginal cases that nevertheless balance one another out, right? Like, if that's
02:06:25 it, you would look at that and be like, hmm, either way, someone's gonna lose their dick.
02:06:30 So like, which one, which one is better? I don't know.
02:06:35 Yeah, I understand your, your willingness to see the data before making a decision.
02:06:41 Like that, that's what that's what it would take to convince me of anything.
02:06:44 Yeah, I think at this point, the voicemails are still like trying to convince you
02:06:49 um, you know, with like, with like this weird appeal to emotion, like, oh, that's so cruel
02:06:54 to a baby. It's like, I don't give a fuck. That's, that's not a good, that's, because it's mean,
02:07:00 because you don't think, I don't know, this like, with like, oh, the babies are you implying that
02:07:06 it causes some kind of emotional trauma? Because I don't think so. I don't think like, Sigmund
02:07:11 Ford was like, Oh, yeah, the circumcision has really like fucked up a generation of babies
02:07:16 or whatever. Like, nobody says that that they've got some like emotional trauma from circumcision.
02:07:22 Nobody does. Maybe the data would say otherwise, but I don't know. I've, I mean, maybe I've never
02:07:29 heard, I've never, I've never heard of it as someone's like, Oh yeah, this being circumcised
02:07:35 gave this baby trust issues or something. Yeah, I guess it's because it happens so early in life,
02:07:40 you don't really have anything to, to like, you know, you don't even know what's going on,
02:07:46 because you didn't remember having it. You don't, you don't miss it. And like,
02:07:50 you might experience like a moment of discomfort, but you won't be able to, you won't be like,
02:07:55 you don't know why you can't like associate like, Oh, the reason I felt this was because
02:08:00 this person did something. You just probably like, you feel some pain in your dick for a moment,
02:08:05 and then for a while afterwards, and there's nothing you can do about it. I don't know.
02:08:11 Anyway, whatever. I just don't think it's, I just don't think it's a great argument. I just don't.
02:08:20 Next up, we got an email from Frost Drive. Three, two, one, go.
02:08:26 So I was listening to an old episode of the PCP and in it, the comic website platform,
02:08:31 Tapis was brought up and you guys kept saying something like Topis or Topaz. I just want to
02:08:36 let you guys know the correct pronunciation is Tapas. And on the topic of comics, I have a series
02:08:42 on there with a few thousand readers, but I've been thinking lately that's not enough. And I've
02:08:46 also realized that putting all of your content online for free, pretty cringe, bro. So going forward,
02:08:53 I'm thinking about reserving my comic series, like the main narrative for only backers on
02:08:57 kick starters, and it'll continue to grow the fan base online through comic strips of the series
02:09:01 and email marketing. That's what I'm going to do. It's pretty interesting topic to me. I don't know
02:09:04 about you guys, but is it cringe or based? Let me know in the comments below and don't forget to
02:09:08 smash like, smash subscribe for the PCP. Also, Ben, I got your comic in the mail finally from the
02:09:13 Kickstarter. Oh, fuck you. Very cool. Love the black envelope in the white letters. I'm definitely
02:09:18 copying you. Thanks, dog. Go for it. I don't know whether it is like based or cringe to keep
02:09:29 some content for backers only. I think that's fine. It just depends on whether that is effective at
02:09:34 growing an audience as much as you want. Yeah. Yeah. At the end of the day, I mean,
02:09:39 that's what matters. It's like, you know, you got you got to balance. You got to balance
02:09:46 you got to balance, like, you know, public outreach, I guess, versus like,
02:09:51 generation of revenue, and like, whatever way works for you, like, is fine and is probably
02:09:57 what you should do. And I'm not going to begrudge anyone for that. I think I think that it's cringe
02:10:06 to I mean, it's cringe to overpaywall and like, you know, paywall all your stuff and then no one
02:10:14 ever ever sees your shit. And then like, you don't grow and nobody yeah, but it's it's it's
02:10:21 it's to some extent, probably also cringe to underpaywall and like, never charge for anything.
02:10:27 And put and just do everything for free. I know that like, it carries the benefit that like, if
02:10:33 you're if your stuff is good, and it gets popular, you know, you accrue social capital, which is
02:10:38 valuable in in its own right. So it's, you know, it's not really for free exactly. But I mean,
02:10:45 you do have to monetize it at some point, if you're ever going to take it beyond just being a hobby
02:10:50 that you do. So, you know, you know, I mean, just yeah, it's it's a I think a nice base thing to
02:11:01 do is just whatever works. I think a nice middle of ground is is usually to have paywall for early
02:11:09 access to content. That's usually fine. That was yeah, yeah, everybody ends up seeing it. But if
02:11:18 you're really into it, you can get to see it early. Or you can get to see special behind the scene
02:11:22 stuff. I guess I did. I guess I don't really think of it as paywalling. But I guess I did. I have
02:11:28 technically paywalled the vaporettes, because they are only in the book.
02:11:35 That's yeah, that's a cool one. Because like, they're they're side story content. They're not
02:11:39 been saying original art. So it's like, I don't have to read them. But they are really cool. So
02:11:46 I mean, I would consider them to be, I mean, they're not been saying art, but they're been,
02:11:51 I mean, they're canon and everything. And I wrote yeah, yeah. So like, you know, they're just as
02:11:54 valid. But yeah, I guess that's, I guess, like, I paywalled a little bit. I will probably at some
02:12:01 point in the future, I will make them public. But like, maybe not until after I maybe have like,
02:12:05 another thing that's going to have like, you know, some of its own like, associated.
02:12:11 I hate the word but paywalled content. Yeah, interesting. It's like, it's like a,
02:12:22 it's one of those things that like, probably, you will never, there is no answer. It's just
02:12:27 got to be one of those like, two conflicting forces that one must must forever balance,
02:12:34 you know, in their life or whatever, or in their, in their brand.
02:12:40 Next one is called perpetually two weeks behind three, two, one, go.
02:12:47 Hey, I always let a new podcast episode come out before I watch the previous one,
02:12:53 some always two weeks behind. But so far, all the guests have been really interesting,
02:12:58 and they're intending to listen to, to keep up the good work.
02:13:03 Wouldn't it be funny if this guy, he's two weeks behind. So wouldn't it be funny if like,
02:13:09 this guy ends up being someone who gets mad about Mallory?
02:13:17 You know, thinking about, thinking about it, it's easy to see like the, the dislike. Oh,
02:13:22 we didn't even talk about, we didn't talk about last episode and the reaction it got.
02:13:28 I mean, we didn't really need to.
02:13:31 We talked about it. We talked about it. I mean, I kind of wanted to, I mean,
02:13:34 I talked about it with Jim. We talked about it with Jim a little bit before the episode started,
02:13:40 just to like, I don't know, because I, because I sort of intended to like reference it a little bit.
02:13:45 But um, yeah, I, you know, it's, it's, it felt like, and my emotional reaction to
02:13:58 all the, the, the, the, the downvote ratio and the proliferation of like,
02:14:06 unfavorable, let's say, comments was to be like, dang, the people are mad. The people are riled up.
02:14:14 I have like offended the community with this and, you know, that's, and, and, and it pisses me off.
02:14:23 Wait, I gotta look at the numbers. But actually, you know, on reflection, it's easy to feel that way.
02:14:28 But really, like, I mean, the video got, oh, it's almost, it's still under half likes, but like,
02:14:37 you know, the video got three, it got 113 likes so far.
02:14:41 Um, and 140 dislikes. So racialized, it's bad, but like, that only represents maybe like 100 people
02:14:48 who were upset enough to, to click the downvote button where they wouldn't have, you know? So,
02:14:56 you know, it's definitely, it's definitely a small but vocal minority of people that were
02:15:03 upset about it, upon reflection.
02:15:06 It's, it's, it's the last remnants of, of the waiting for Nate crowd, I guess.
02:15:14 You think so?
02:15:15 They, they, they don't like the direction the show is going and this is like the final straw,
02:15:19 like, I can't believe, I can't believe you got someone like that.
02:15:23 Imagine, imagine being mad that someone's not on the podcast, on a podcast anymore. Imagine
02:15:30 being mad about that at the people who are still on and not at the person who isn't on.
02:15:37 Like imagine, imagine coping that hard that you like, displace, blame somewhere it doesn't belong
02:15:45 to that extent. I don't know. It's wild. It's wild to me. Uh, I mean, I said, I said in that,
02:15:51 I'll put out a little thing, like, I don't think people who like Nate equals people who are angry
02:15:56 at the thing. No, there's, I didn't mean, I didn't mean to imply that. I didn't mean to
02:16:01 imply that it's like, oh, everyone who liked Nate on the podcast is a piece of shit.
02:16:05 No, no, no. Like, like legitimately not even true, but no. But yeah, it, it is a vocal minority
02:16:13 that didn't like her because I don't know what I said in the episode is like that it's, she
02:16:20 represents a thing that she doesn't actually represent like truly. They just think she does
02:16:28 and then they hate that and then therefore they hate her and they won't listen to her.
02:16:32 It was, it was weird to see that like, I mean, I've seen like all the vitriol she's gotten on
02:16:37 like Twitter. I kind of assumed that like people would just sort of, I mean, maybe I assumed that
02:16:48 like they wouldn't have the same reaction to like hearing her talk and like seeing her on a podcast
02:16:54 as they would just like, I can kind of, I don't agree with it, but I can understand how if you
02:16:59 are someone who thinks that like stealing is really wrong, you read the shoplifting comment
02:17:04 and you make get mad about it. I can kind of understand like at least the process there,
02:17:09 but to then like get mad at her, just her on a podcast. I didn't, I didn't think it would carry
02:17:17 over. It was weird to see like as soon as the first I mean, I thought it would carry over because
02:17:21 I saw the ratio. I was like, wow, no, it's, it's, it's, it carry, it does. I was surprised.
02:17:27 I, I mean, I felt like it would absolutely would because she's only known right now,
02:17:35 largely in circles that don't like her through those specific things we put in the thumbnail
02:17:40 and they're going to be like, what? I guess I just didn't and they just sort of associated
02:17:45 whatever they felt with those things as like, you know,
02:17:49 yeah, but like it's a new written in stone that this is a bad person and a bad person is on the
02:17:55 show. Man, he's really going downhill and they just really reacted immediately.
02:18:00 But even if you didn't, even if you didn't like, I don't know, just even if you didn't like the
02:18:04 comics, I don't understand why you would have the same reaction to that person in like a totally
02:18:08 different context. You know, it's, I don't know. I mean, I guess, I guess we did show the comics in
02:18:16 the, yeah, I can see, I can see that it just doesn't like, I couldn't imagine. I'm not sure
02:18:24 whether a lot of the people who reacted angrily really listened to the episode at all. Maybe
02:18:30 they listened to like the first 20 minutes just to get an idea before commenting. But like, I don't
02:18:35 think many of them would have stuck around before they were like, God, fuck this person. You know
02:18:42 nothing. She was a horrible person on Twitter. I don't know. It's, it's funny because like,
02:18:48 if you think she's a terrible person, I think you probably think the same about me. So why,
02:18:55 why do you listen to this podcast that I am on every episode of? I don't get it.
02:19:00 Uh, that's weird. It's weird, man. Damn! Damn! Um, did I have anything else to say about that?
02:19:11 No, not really. Strange, strange times we live in. Next one is Son of Marowak. I know this guy.
02:19:23 Uh, three, two, one, go.
02:19:28 All right. Son of Marowak here. Yeah. So I just been watching the series of videos by Lindsay Ellis,
02:19:36 talking about an omega verse lawsuit that's been going on for like the past year and a half or so.
02:19:42 I've seen those. The first video she made is just her talking about the lawsuit in question and
02:19:52 how much of an asshole the villain of the lawsuit is. The second video is her in response to
02:20:02 the villain of the lawsuit. It's giving Lindsay crap about the video that she made.
02:20:10 And Lindsay goes through all of the points in documents that were sent to her in regards to the
02:20:16 video and owns how each or every single one of them were wrong. Like this villain of the lawsuit
02:20:24 is a complete asshole. It doesn't know what the hell she's talking about. Go watch these videos
02:20:31 if you haven't already. Tell me what you think of them. Oh, that's the question. I just want to
02:20:40 know what we think. Have you seen those? I've seen those. I, like in terms of Lindsay Ellis videos,
02:20:48 I didn't really give a shit too much. Like I've watched the first one and then, you know,
02:20:52 the second one was like, okay. But it's like the crazy idiot who does a lawsuit that is stupid
02:20:59 and then gets angry at a YouTuber exposing this stupid lawsuit, you know, double combo,
02:21:06 is like a pattern I've seen like a hundred times on YouTube. So like for Lindsay Ellis video,
02:21:11 wasn't that interesting to be honest? It felt like a repeat of like everything else.
02:21:16 Like the H3 thing with the thing and then. Was it Graham Linnum? Was there, what was the H3
02:21:24 lawsuit? Oh, no, no, no. I was thinking of H Bomber Guy. Oh, H3. This sort of stuff has happened
02:21:31 so many times. It's like, yes, we all understand. Oh, Jim Sterling, another person, like he made
02:21:37 a bad review of a video game. He got attacked by what's his face. Kind of remember him. But
02:21:43 that like they're always stupid. The lawsuits always fail because they're stupid clearly.
02:21:47 And it's just like, yeah, that's another one of these. I know what you mean. I thought that,
02:21:53 I thought that the first one about the Omegaverse was pretty interesting. I thought it was funny,
02:21:59 you know. Yeah. But yeah, the second one about like now I'm being sued, it's like,
02:22:05 yeah, that's a funny fact, I guess. But like the story about it is, it's like you said it.
02:22:11 I've seen this kind of thing before. And I'm like 100% sure that Lindsay Ellis will be fine.
02:22:16 So I'm not like worried. Yes, she seemed more fine than most because she had like YouTube
02:22:23 protecting her apparently. Oh yeah, that's true. That's unusual.
02:22:28 It was on you. That was the most interesting part was the how much YouTube was on her side about it.
02:22:33 Which seems, I don't, does that make me like YouTube more or less? That they will protect
02:22:40 anyone or that they will own? No. Am I glad that they'll protect anyone or am I angry that they
02:22:45 will go to such lengths to protect someone big and do nothing for anyone else? Yeah, it's the same
02:22:51 old like she's big, she's a published author now, she's like a big deal and she's got a huge
02:22:56 Patreon. Of course they would help her. Yeah, yeah. Which I'm glad they at least do that sometimes,
02:23:06 but it's like it still speaks to YouTube's ineptitude on the lower levels. In this case,
02:23:11 it's nice that they did something for someone who is obviously in the right, I guess. But yeah, like
02:23:19 would I be like super broken up if Lindsay Ellis got like, I don't know, some copyright claims
02:23:26 against her? Like whatever, she's fine. Yeah. No, I thought the first one explaining the whole
02:23:34 like debacle like beforehand though and going into like what is the Omegaverse was like pretty
02:23:39 entertaining. Have the legal eagle man come in? I feel there's something about there's something
02:23:50 about legal eagle man that like upsets me. Is it the Dr. Wolf jaw? He does. They have the same,
02:24:02 oh my god, you're right. You're right. The first thing I noticed about him is like,
02:24:06 oh this guy, this is like a good version of Dr. Wolf where everything went right.
02:24:11 You know, I have watched my fair share of legal eagle and I think it's fine. It's fine content,
02:24:18 but like there's something so manicured about him and like his and like I get that like that's the
02:24:26 point. Of course he wants to come off as like polished and professional. His whole thing is
02:24:31 that he's a lawyer. He needs to like appear as like a professional. I don't know, I guess I'm like
02:24:38 he's just he's too plain to be like a relatable character on YouTube, do you mean? Yeah, maybe
02:24:46 a little bit like he's so like the fact that he just kind of shows up, does the YouTube thing
02:24:55 and just, you know, duly rewarded for it. It's like a little frustrating
02:24:59 whenever I see that. Like this guy hasn't even beaten Sans in Undertale.
02:25:05 I guess, I don't know, I don't know like, I guess I wonder like to what extent
02:25:14 professionally is he like a lawyer versus a YouTuber, do you know what I mean?
02:25:20 Yeah, it feels like he's so like hard in the YouTube game that it feels like this must be
02:25:24 his full-time shtick, but he sort of sells himself on the premise that like his job is that he's a
02:25:29 lawyer. Like I don't know, does he even practice anymore? Because he's like fucking, he's fucking
02:25:35 hobnobbing with like big, big, you know, YouTube people making like, what's that like Nebula,
02:25:43 making Nebula with fucking like Patrick H. Willems and Lindsay Ellis and whoever the fuck else.
02:25:48 I mean, I could imagine he's a, he's a lawyer that has like
02:25:54 got into the YouTube thing just as a hobby, because it's like, don't have work right now,
02:25:58 I may as well use my knowledge to make content. And you know, he's just so, he's just so goddamn
02:26:05 handsome that it makes me mad. It's just like, oh, of course, this guy was like, hmm, I'm a lawyer,
02:26:14 and I'm disgustingly good looking. You know, I should probably, I should probably flex that
02:26:21 to also become like wildly successful on YouTube as well. And he just does it and it just happens.
02:26:27 You know, that sucks. It's not to say that like he didn't, like, I mean, you know, he made the
02:26:35 content, I guess, I guess he put the work in, I guess, but in a way that's like,
02:26:41 you know, this is how I always feel. People, I feel this way about everyone rich and people say,
02:26:48 like, oh, I'm just like salty. I'm just like, oh, you're just jealous. I'm like, yeah, sure, I guess.
02:26:53 It just always frustrates me. It frustrates me whenever I feel like what I'm seeing is like a
02:26:58 person being rewarded in a way that's incommensurate with the work they put in. And I feel like that's
02:27:04 true of like basically everyone, that's true of like everyone who's rich at all. And it's true of
02:27:10 like most people who are successful on YouTube. It was part of a, you know, a growing up, I assume,
02:27:15 I don't actually know. Like, wealthy enough to go to law school at all is a pretty big step up.
02:27:23 To do all of the law school stuff is not easy, obviously. It's like, you know, the opportunities
02:27:31 provided to him to go to that sort of place is like, you need money already and can't do that
02:27:37 unless you live in at least a middle class family. Probably. Yeah, sure. I mean, that too.
02:27:47 Yeah, I don't know. It's just, it's just to see, you know, he does a very formulaic stick and it's
02:27:54 a fine stick. And it just frustrates me whenever I see someone do it by the book. And it just works.
02:28:03 That's what I see when I look at legal legal. This guy just showed up was like,
02:28:07 what's the formula? Okay, I'll do that. And it worked, you know?
02:28:12 Like Captain Christian. Captain Crispin. Like Captain Christian. Yeah, Captain Christian, I know.
02:28:18 I think that's his name. The video essay man. The video essay, like, perfect algorithm.
02:28:27 Yeah. Perfect thumbnails, perfect release schedule.
02:28:31 I like, I like talk shit about him on Twitter one time and he responded,
02:28:35 I don't know, to like call me jealous or something. And, and it's like, same thing. I just,
02:28:42 I just think, I just think, you know, I just think it's, it is kind of like jealousy because it's
02:28:50 like, everybody wishes that they just happened to do all the right things at the right time,
02:28:57 first try. Well, not first try. You don't know how many times these people have tried, but
02:29:03 like, it all seems, because that's, you know, internet personalities in a nutshell,
02:29:08 everything seems to be the perfect version of everything that's going on.
02:29:12 Yeah. Like, it's, oh, it's just so happens that everything went perfectly and I'm a perfect
02:29:18 person and you feel like you are inadequate because you're not me. Ha ha.
02:29:23 Indeed. And it's like, nobody sets out to make people feel shit, but it happens.
02:29:31 Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, the, the Lindsay Alice. Yeah, whatever. Cool. Next up, voicemail.
02:29:45 Margar is dead. Three, two, one, go.
02:29:53 Oh, I can't believe how easy it all wasn't yet.
02:29:58 Months of planning, months of hard work. Ben, all I had to do was wait for your other enemies
02:30:07 to set me free. And now I'm on the outside. Samurai came for me just as I knew he would.
02:30:16 I knew he couldn't wait that long. And when he came to my cell, I just used a little deception,
02:30:23 a little murder origami to create a fake copy of myself. Now I'm officially dead.
02:30:28 The oldest trick in the book. You can't convict a dead man. So I'm out and I'll be seeing you real
02:30:35 soon, Ben. Just know it didn't have to be this way.
02:30:41 Is that, that was Margar, right? I'm, I, yeah, I believe so. Oh, no, he's out.
02:30:49 He played me like a fiddle. He played you like a fiddle by being so boring that someone decided to kill him.
02:30:56 This is fun all along.
02:31:06 Well, it reminds me of two things. Reminds me of the time on Twitter that Chris Chan said that she
02:31:10 would be like seeing me soon. Remember that? I mean, as she said that like 10 times,
02:31:18 isn't that every time you cross paths? Maybe more than once, but it was at least one time that
02:31:24 she said like she would be seeing me soon in person and like the, yeah, yeah. And like the
02:31:30 implication was that she was going to be like astrally projecting to curse me or something or
02:31:38 maybe just to talk to me. I don't know. So, you know, that's just one more thing to be afraid of,
02:31:43 I guess. And the other thing it reminds me of, in, did you, do you remember the essay or do you
02:31:52 remember the thing that gets read in Frog Fractions when you're in the underwater segment?
02:31:58 The essay is about boxing before the punching meta had arrived.
02:32:06 Did you, did you watch, did you rewatch either of those no-clip documentaries?
02:32:10 I did, yeah.
02:32:11 Do you remember the part, this part killed me. It's not, it's not what it is. It's the way that
02:32:16 he said it, that Jim said it in that he said like the essay is about the idea that like
02:32:23 punching is not an essential part of boxing. It is only emergent from the rule set.
02:32:29 And that like before anyone just, that really boxing is just a contest to knock your opponent out.
02:32:35 And it used to be about like you just had to bore them to sleep with stories until someone
02:32:40 discovered that, wait a minute, actually the fastest way to get someone to be unconscious
02:32:44 is just to punch them. That's how like modern boxing was invented.
02:32:48 It's really cool. Yeah, yeah.
02:32:50 It's a great lateral thinking.
02:32:54 Yeah. Well, I guess, I guess I've been outsmarted once again. I guess this is just the theme
02:33:02 of the voicemails now, but that's fine. You know what? It's better this way. Who wants to know
02:33:08 everything? Last, last voicemail is called I miss old PCP cry face. Three, two, one, go.
02:33:21 Hey, you, yeah, you guy instantly commenting and disliking the last episode of the PCP
02:33:27 commenting on how you miss the good old days. It was so much fun and better and you fell in love
02:33:32 with everyone on the first 50 episodes. And now things aren't good because Ben bad and Ben
02:33:40 invited Mallory on and you don't like her or something. Lol.
02:33:44 Commenters rule number one, you fake PCP fan.
02:33:50 Commenters rule number one. I guess I'm a fake fan myself. Number one is the don't comment
02:33:55 so you watch the whole thing, right? Yeah. Like, you know,
02:34:02 that's the thing I was imagining most people were not listening to what Mallory had to say
02:34:07 before commenting that she's a terrible piece of shit because she doesn't come across like one.
02:34:13 You know, I, I don't know. I think that probably, I don't know if that's the problem
02:34:22 is that people weren't watching the whole episode because I'm pretty sure that if you came in
02:34:26 thinking that way and being, being like, if you come, if you, if you, if you're like,
02:34:32 Oh, I hate new PCP. If you're like, Oh, I hate this guest. If you hate Mallory specifically
02:34:36 or whatever, I don't think that watching all the way to the end, like I don't think that anything
02:34:41 that we said in the episode, well, I mean, maybe it's possible that something we said on the episode,
02:34:46 you might be persuaded like, Oh, you know, this person isn't like I thought or whatever, maybe.
02:34:50 But I think a lot of people would not be persuaded and they would just be like,
02:34:52 Yeah, this is what I, this is what I expected to hear.
02:34:56 You know, maybe, I mean, I would need to know what they think.
02:35:01 Yeah, like what their assumption was.
02:35:04 You know, I think, I think that no, I'm, I'm partially wrong. I think that probably a lot of
02:35:09 people would hear Mallory say like, you know, the new guy comic was like just kind of like a spur
02:35:19 of the moment thing that I didn't even really think about too hard and be like,
02:35:22 I guess, I guess what doesn't really matter. And like to hear her say like, okay, well,
02:35:26 the shoplifting thing is just like, you know, it's, you know, when you're poor, it's just about
02:35:32 like being poor as a kid or whatever, it'd be like, I guess that makes sense. But I don't think
02:35:37 everyone would be persuaded. I think maybe half and half, I don't know. So while yes, of course,
02:35:43 we always encourage comment to rule number one, but I don't know if, I don't know if it solves
02:35:49 the issue. I don't know if it, I don't know. I mean, what we talk about in the episode was more
02:35:54 about like how her own people turned against her, not really people who already don't like her.
02:36:00 Because if it were more about the other people, we would have had explanations and more like
02:36:05 in depth talk about like why shoplifting could be an okay thing.
02:36:10 It's true. Yeah, we didn't even really talk about it from that angle. Yeah.
02:36:19 I don't know. I think we've done a really great job of burning off the old PCP heads.
02:36:26 We've we've seared away the crust, the cruft, the chaff left with only the cream, the wheat,
02:36:37 uh, if you will.
02:36:42 That's not keto. I'm getting hungry. No, it's not. No, it's not. God damn. I made,
02:36:47 I made the most delicious grilled cheese and spam sandwich today with keto bread,
02:36:57 with low oven fresh keto bread. Have I talked about low oven fresh?
02:37:02 No. What is keto? How do you make keto bread? Is it cut of flour, dust?
02:37:08 Well, well, you know, I think I've talked about, I was looking for,
02:37:15 this is a funny note to end the episode on, but I looked all over. I tried all kinds of
02:37:20 different bread replacements. I tried the one that everyone tells you to make is cloud bread.
02:37:24 Cloud bread sucks. I hate it. There's another, there was another one that sort of, I ordered
02:37:30 like a mix to like mix it yourself and make a loaf out of that. That one was like, okay.
02:37:35 I tried ordering some like loaves online and from Amazon and like they would like,
02:37:39 either they would have a weird texture or they'd have a weird taste or like when you toasted them,
02:37:43 they would get really hard like a cracker. They had all the, all these different things. And then
02:37:48 I found this, this one brand that they sell, they only sell it at Aldi as far as I'm aware.
02:37:54 And it's called Love and Fresh L-Apostrophe O-V-E-N. And the main ingredient is,
02:38:02 is it wheat gluten? I don't know. It's, it's, it's got some like wheat derivative and it's,
02:38:07 it's perfect. It's amazing. I can't believe it. It just tastes exactly like normal bread.
02:38:12 All the other ones were like weird or bad in some way or just like kind of marginal,
02:38:16 like just good enough that like it's all right. This one's just like, no, they did it.
02:38:20 They, they fucking did it. And it's like three grams of carbs per slice. So,
02:38:24 you know, I can't eat a whole loaf in a day, but I can eat like two or four slices in a day and
02:38:28 it's fine. And I made a fucking grilled, spam and grilled cheese sandwich. So good. So fucking good.
02:38:35 I've been, I've been buying all these different cheeses, making different kinds of grilled cheese
02:38:40 out of them. So far, Monster is my favorite in case you were wondering. I know you were for sure.
02:38:47 Hmm. Yes. Yeah. So yeah. Monster Cheese, highly recommended.
02:38:56 Anything else we have to do before? No, we gotta say, we gotta say patreon.com
02:39:05 slash the procrastinators. That's right. And we gotta say teespring.com slash stores slash the
02:39:12 dash pro dash procrastinators. To get the first loser find purpose November t-shirt.
02:39:19 And we gotta say speakpipe.com slash pcp voicemail. And are we forgetting anything?
02:39:27 Oh, we got bonus episodes. What was the last one we did? Was that with digi?
02:39:33 Yeah, no. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was, it should be coming out this week, right? It should be coming
02:39:39 out to the beginning of November, the commentary track. Yeah, the commentary track on the first
02:39:47 episode. The commentary track. I think it should be, I think it should be available on Patreon
02:39:53 by the time this episode is out, probably. Yes, we actually, we actually did it. And if people
02:40:03 like it, we will do more. So I hope that's not a complete clusterfuck, or that it is,
02:40:10 but people like it anyway. So yeah, Patreon for that. And I guess that's it. Thanks for listening,
02:40:19 everyone. Hey, I guess I should say, here's something. If you like our guests, or if you
02:40:28 liked seeing them on the PCP, and this, this would go for any of our guests actually, Jim,
02:40:33 or Mallory, or Aria, or Mary, or anyone, if it would be cool, if people would like maybe on their
02:40:41 Twitter or something like message them and say like, Hey, I saw you on the PCP, you know, I liked,
02:40:46 I liked it, liked your conversation there, like listening to you, thought it was cool,
02:40:49 thumbs up, good job. That would be a cool thing for people to do. You know, if you're so inclined,
02:40:55 if you like someone we have on, and you want to let them know you appreciate them,
02:40:59 I would think that was pretty based. And go get the frog fractions DLC. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
02:41:05 I am, I am going to buy that. I'm going to buy that today. Actually, I will buy that like right
02:41:12 after this episode is done. And you should too. For old pal Jim. All right. Is that it? We done?
02:41:22 Good night, everybody. Good night, everybody. Good, good, good morrow to you so long and thanks
02:41:27 for all the fish. Fish, delicious. Bye.
