00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm the best
00:00:13 guy ever. Check the encyclopedia for best. That's me. We've also got Hippocrit is here.
00:00:21 I want Wuya to be my parent.
00:00:25 Mumkey Jones is here.
00:00:27 Hey everybody I'm Mumkey Jones. You look up Mumkey in the dictionary. That's a picture
00:00:31 of me.
00:00:33 Tom Oliver is here.
00:00:35 Yeah. I have nothing witty to say.
00:00:38 And our last guy is Mumkey Jones is here.
00:00:43 Hey guys it's me, Munchy.
00:00:46 And to exercise my independence from my parents I'm about to order a pizza and I'm going to
00:00:51 have to get it on air like 30 minutes from now.
00:00:55 That's fascinating.
00:00:57 When you said you want Wuya to be your mom, do you mean like Wuya from Shallown Showdown?
00:01:01 Or the game console, the Wuya.
00:01:04 Well either.
00:01:06 Now what's your favorite Shen Gong Wu from Shallown Showdown?
00:01:09 It's been a long time.
00:01:11 Just say the Mikey stuff.
00:01:13 Mummy! My pizza! Can you get it for me, Mummy?
00:01:18 She's such a good woman.
00:01:21 I know. I have seen her vagina and it has served me well.
00:01:24 Okay moving on.
00:01:26 Speaking of having sex with people we're talking about Munchy's parents today.
00:01:31 Munchy, is your mom actually hot?
00:01:35 Nah.
00:01:37 I've kind of got a thing for Mexican chicks.
00:01:39 No, she's not the Mexican one.
00:01:42 What the fuck?
00:01:44 You're another one of those mixed breed fucking dogs?
00:01:47 Cuckolds.
00:01:49 Did your dad get thrown over the wall?
00:01:53 Is that what happened?
00:01:55 Dad!
00:01:59 My Mexican pizza dad!
00:02:02 Munchy, I thought it was revealed that I'm your father and I'm also the Zodiac killer.
00:02:07 Well yeah, that's why you're over the wall, bro.
00:02:10 You're going to get deported.
00:02:12 And I voted for Trump. It was the ultimate betrayal.
00:02:15 Okay, so Trump is my real dad.
00:02:18 We're talking about parents. That's what's going on.
00:02:21 So where do we fucking take a discussion about parents?
00:02:26 I guess we can start with the tales of our own and the various rapes they've committed.
00:02:30 Are we going to discuss childhood and parents or just the parents or just the wife fucking?
00:02:36 It's all connected, man.
00:02:38 Whatever tickles your face.
00:02:39 Everything that goes with parenting and parents and stuff.
00:02:43 I guess I'll begin.
00:02:45 I like my dad. He's cool. He's a cool guy.
00:02:49 He's confident and he's reserved, but he knows how to do things.
00:02:54 He's a business man. He's a smart man.
00:02:57 He's always been on the right side of debates.
00:03:01 Always? Always?
00:03:03 When it comes to like stuff on the news.
00:03:07 What did your dad vote for in Brexit?
00:03:09 He's the sort of person who would like,
00:03:12 you know what, I'll give Trump a chance, but I don't like, I mean, you know.
00:03:16 Sounds like a misogynist.
00:03:18 So he voted to leave the European Union.
00:03:20 No, I don't know what he voted.
00:03:21 A real hero.
00:03:23 But like he's got that nuance.
00:03:26 He's got that understanding of like nuance that I like in people that it doesn't exist in anyone except my dad.
00:03:32 And he's like actually cool.
00:03:34 You know, I was going to say, you know, we all have a strong bias in that we all know our parents,
00:03:39 like especially our parents, we know better than anyone else in our lives for the most part,
00:03:43 except maybe our siblings.
00:03:45 But in any case, it's a lot easier to look at them and see the complexities going behind them
00:03:51 as opposed to like some guy who voted for Trump.
00:03:54 Like who knows what his complicated reasonings are other than, you know, hating immigrants, you know, being racist.
00:03:59 Because he thought it would be funny. I'm right here, Nate.
00:04:03 But in any case.
00:04:05 It's like, it's just sort of, you know, he introduced me.
00:04:10 Like he is always like the sort of sensible one when it comes to like things that happen on the news.
00:04:16 He's like, well, you know, this isn't that.
00:04:18 And I'm like, yeah, yeah.
00:04:20 And it's not just that I grew up with him.
00:04:23 It's that stuff on the internet that has influenced me is sort of like the smart people on the internet also are doing what dad's saying.
00:04:32 And he goes on Facebook and that's like, whoa, how could you be like smart and a Facebook user?
00:04:37 I thought they didn't allow dads on Facebook.
00:04:41 I thought that was an infamnia, as the Italians say.
00:04:44 Also, he's really funny and that's why I'm funny.
00:04:46 Now, Hippo, I got a question for you about your parents.
00:04:49 How much do they know about your internet presence and do they support your YouTube dreams?
00:04:55 I think we should all go to that at some point.
00:04:58 My parents know basically that I do YouTube stuff and make money from it.
00:05:04 It was a bit awkward the first time I tried to explain it because they had no idea that that was, you know, internet.
00:05:10 Like because like they're wary of scams.
00:05:14 Like there was one time where I was like looking up how to be a ninja and it was like a course that you had to pay for.
00:05:20 And I was like, no, it's real.
00:05:21 Like they show you like how to do it.
00:05:24 Now, was this when you were six or was this like six days ago?
00:05:27 It's like 16.
00:05:28 Like it's like, you know, it's embarrassing, but it's funny.
00:05:32 So it's funny.
00:05:33 It's fine.
00:05:34 But like, you know, they think, yeah, it's basically just a bunch of crap like dude's press ups and whatever.
00:05:43 But anyway, they're wary of like things scamming me as a kid.
00:05:49 So if I, you know, I wasn't sure whether to tell them I do internet jobs, money, YouTube adsense and they wouldn't understand it.
00:05:57 But they, they surprisingly, you know, just understood it as like, oh yeah, it's just like a thing.
00:06:02 You know, it's like new.
00:06:03 It's like the new wave.
00:06:04 We don't understand it, but it's new and that's cool and go on and do it.
00:06:07 I don't know.
00:06:08 I think my mom watches most of my videos and it's kind of embarrassing sometimes because that means she knows that I swear and I don't know how to feel about that.
00:06:17 But she's, yeah.
00:06:20 Your mom watches your videos about video games, but she doesn't play video games herself.
00:06:25 Are you saying your mom's a fucking fake gamer?
00:06:28 No, no, no, no, no, no.
00:06:30 It's okay because she plays Bejeweled and like cow clickers on her iPad.
00:06:35 She's a real gamer.
00:06:36 She played, you know, she's a Farmville mom.
00:06:39 She's one of those.
00:06:41 Now, can we all, can we all assume that your mom is not subscribed to Gibbon Take because I think you would have been like arrested at this point if she knew about it?
00:06:50 No, no, she subscribed to that.
00:06:51 She subscribed to Gibbon Take because it was my first one.
00:06:54 Oh my God.
00:06:55 Hypocrite.
00:06:56 She probably likes Gibbon Take more because it's more personal, you know?
00:06:59 She must think that her son is crazy.
00:07:01 No.
00:07:02 Well, I mean.
00:07:03 Now, now Gibbon, what is a shit post?
00:07:07 I don't understand.
00:07:09 I can't do a British accent.
00:07:11 I understand her mom voice.
00:07:12 Yeah.
00:07:13 It's a woman voice, first of all, because they're all shrill and retarded.
00:07:16 And also, I can't do a British accent.
00:07:18 It is me a foreigner.
00:07:22 I'm a foreigner in Turkey.
00:07:26 Hello, Gibbon.
00:07:27 This is me, your mom.
00:07:29 I want you to understand your videos.
00:07:31 Oh, that reminds me.
00:07:32 My dad's like a really good cook.
00:07:34 Like he cooks like all types of things like curries and Italian food.
00:07:37 Italian accent reminded you.
00:07:39 No, because he's really good at cooking Italian things and he knows a lot of things about Italians.
00:07:45 I am a quarter Italian, all right?
00:07:47 And how dare you say my people are good at cooking.
00:07:49 That's very offensive.
00:07:51 Italian's not a fucking race.
00:07:53 What are you talking about?
00:07:54 It's not a fucking race.
00:07:55 Get rid of Italians.
00:07:56 Number two, get rid of Russians.
00:07:58 Those are the worst people.
00:08:00 Italians and Russians.
00:08:01 Russian girls are hot.
00:08:03 Monkey.
00:08:04 You're about to order pizza, monkey.
00:08:06 Why are you saying this about Italians?
00:08:08 I don't know.
00:08:10 They're poison.
00:08:12 I think Russian girls have the objectively hottest accent.
00:08:15 I've done the studies and that's what the survey says.
00:08:18 They're talk like they got the dick already in their mouth.
00:08:24 You know.
00:08:25 Halfway there already.
00:08:27 Of course.
00:08:28 Women are objects.
00:08:29 Continue.
00:08:30 Hashtag women are objects.
00:08:32 You're talking about your dad and how he's going to cook it.
00:08:34 How your mom's an object?
00:08:35 Yeah.
00:08:36 Oh, no.
00:08:40 What should I talk about specifically?
00:08:42 Why don't you just tell us about growing up with your parents
00:08:44 and what use did they provide to you?
00:08:47 What objects and needs did they serve
00:08:50 that could have been better performed by a machine or something like that?
00:08:53 How late did you get from them?
00:08:55 Well, aside from the obvious food and water
00:08:59 and clothing and roof under my head.
00:09:04 You have to sleep on the roof.
00:09:06 They have been supportive of my creative endeavors in general.
00:09:11 They've never really forced me to say,
00:09:14 you've got to get a job or you're getting out of here.
00:09:17 I know they want me.
00:09:19 When I wasn't making any money or doing anything,
00:09:21 they wanted me to leave and I was like, yeah, I know.
00:09:23 But they didn't force me.
00:09:25 They're very supportive and they don't take bullshit from my teachers.
00:09:32 They were always on my side when it was like the teacher being a piece of shit.
00:09:36 So that was cool.
00:09:38 That's nice.
00:09:39 Like that time you got in trouble at school
00:09:41 for saying you were going to kill somebody or something?
00:09:43 Yeah.
00:09:44 That's a real story.
00:09:45 Yeah.
00:09:46 The time I got in trouble...
00:09:47 Wait, that same shit happened to me.
00:09:48 I thought you were making fun of me.
00:09:49 No, no.
00:09:50 It's real.
00:09:51 Oh, man.
00:09:52 Oh, gee.
00:09:53 He will kill you at school if he sees you, kids.
00:09:54 Watch out.
00:09:55 It wasn't exactly that.
00:09:56 I wrote in my art book.
00:09:58 Ah, fuck all this shit.
00:09:59 It was basically the fact that I was frustrated
00:10:02 and I was writing swears in my art book.
00:10:04 My teacher saw it and instead of talking to me,
00:10:07 she just reported my potential dangerous tendencies to the head teacher
00:10:16 so that I was suspended for a few weeks to calm down.
00:10:20 I'm sure that's like policy they have for reporting.
00:10:22 It's like that.
00:10:23 But what a fucking cowardly, backhanded way to deal with the situation like that.
00:10:27 When I came back, I really made an effort to be kind of a bitch to that teacher
00:10:32 because fuck her.
00:10:33 Good.
00:10:34 She does not deserve my respect after not even trying to approach me about it.
00:10:39 Yeah.
00:10:40 Anyway, yes.
00:10:42 Awful.
00:10:43 Put her in the fucking garbage.
00:10:45 My parents' school sucks too.
00:10:46 Yeah, this is kind of linked.
00:10:48 Yeah, I wanted to be on the school podcast to talk about that.
00:10:52 Fuck the PCP, hippo.
00:10:53 We'll do a school sucks later.
00:10:55 Yeah.
00:10:56 Yeah.
00:10:57 Shooting your school as if it wasn't easy.
00:10:59 By the way, to all my followers, why is that the new default thing now?
00:11:05 I get a comment blank as if it was easy all the time.
00:11:08 It's so easy to add on to something.
00:11:10 It could be anything you could edit.
00:11:12 You know what I like to add to the end of like titles of things is we're going to make
00:11:17 X look like a fucking joke, you know, like Columbine or 9-11, things like that.
00:11:22 That's a good name for a sequel.
00:11:24 The bug wars look like a fucking joke.
00:11:26 Just kidding.
00:11:27 Oh, no.
00:11:28 It's too fucking serious.
00:11:30 You can never make such a jest out of such.
00:11:32 Everyone, make sure you're following Munchy at Munchy Wears Tiny Hats on Twitter to get
00:11:36 the full bug wars saga documented.
00:11:38 The bug wars were the most depressed I've ever been in my entire life, especially after
00:11:42 I fell down the stairs after I slipped on a puddle of chocolate in that place by myself.
00:11:47 Fuck.
00:11:48 The bug wars were awful.
00:11:50 People discussed them no longer.
00:11:53 A new person, new person.
00:11:55 This man's too upset.
00:11:56 Okay.
00:11:57 Munchy, why don't you tell us about your...
00:11:59 Wait, I'm sorry.
00:12:00 I meant to say Mumkey.
00:12:01 I meant to say Mumkey.
00:12:02 I can't sound myself.
00:12:04 Okay.
00:12:05 Mumkey.
00:12:06 What's up with your parents?
00:12:07 What, you know, how disappointed?
00:12:08 I don't know who you mean.
00:12:09 Me or him?
00:12:10 I'm talking about you, god damn it.
00:12:12 Mumkey.
00:12:13 I can't fucking tell.
00:12:14 The meat runs too deep.
00:12:15 Mumkey.
00:12:16 Yeah, Mumkey.
00:12:17 Right.
00:12:18 All right.
00:12:19 Munchy, this question does not apply to you because of your age.
00:12:22 But are you guys aware of the show Viva La Bam?
00:12:26 Yes.
00:12:27 No, I don't think so.
00:12:28 Okay.
00:12:29 So for anybody at home, it's this old show about the adventures of Bam Margera just harassing
00:12:33 his parents all the time.
00:12:35 And the reason why I bring it up is because I think my relationship with my parents is
00:12:39 almost identical.
00:12:40 Oh no.
00:12:41 Where they're like these two just like normies, you know, and then I'm like the rambunctious
00:12:46 crazy child who just fucks with them all day.
00:12:49 But it all, it all comes from a place of love in some way.
00:12:52 To bring this in a way I understand, is this similar to Johnny Test, you know, he's like
00:12:56 a rambunctious kid.
00:12:57 I wouldn't compare Johnny Test to Bam Margera.
00:12:59 We need a really carbon copy of Johnny Test.
00:13:03 Now I understand.
00:13:04 Okay, okay.
00:13:05 Dude, if I had twin older sisters who were hot, I would have been incesting the fuck
00:13:09 out of that show.
00:13:10 And they are super hot.
00:13:11 And voiced my premier My Little Pony voice actor, Tara Strong.
00:13:15 Does she do both of them?
00:13:16 No, she only did one.
00:13:18 I like the one with the curly hair, not the straight hair.
00:13:21 She's hot as fuck.
00:13:22 I can never tell them apart.
00:13:23 You are racist.
00:13:24 Yeah.
00:13:25 That's white people.
00:13:26 That's twins.
00:13:28 So go on.
00:13:29 So what did you do?
00:13:30 Did you torment them?
00:13:31 It's almost perfectly analogous because my mom, much like Bam's mom, April, is just
00:13:36 always confused and wondering where this torture is coming from and what she did to
00:13:41 deserve it.
00:13:42 Whereas my dad kind of like tries to go with the flow and laugh and have fun.
00:13:47 One example I can provide is because I've had my parents, both of them in a video at
00:13:52 some point way back in the day, I did a movie missions podcast with me, Manimal, and my
00:13:59 dad because the audience voted for us to watch a Serbian film, which is a movie about a man
00:14:09 who is drugged and fucks his son in the ass.
00:14:12 Nice.
00:14:13 Nice.
00:14:14 Whoa.
00:14:15 Did he start the day thinking he was going to do that and kind of just end up in that
00:14:19 situation?
00:14:20 So about a week before the end, I was like, you know what, dad, we're doing this movie
00:14:24 podcast and I want you to be on this episode and you'll see why once we watch the movie.
00:14:29 And he was like really nervous all week because he's probably like camera shy.
00:14:33 He doesn't want to like get on mic and talk because he knows that there's going to be
00:14:36 a few thousand people who watch it.
00:14:38 And like he knows all about my monkey shit and he's, I don't know if he's ashamed or
00:14:41 proud or what, but he's like it is what it is.
00:14:44 So he clearly didn't want any part in it.
00:14:47 But I guilt-tripped him kind of into like, oh, come on, come on the podcast, dad, it'll
00:14:51 be fun.
00:14:52 You know, like we need a guest.
00:14:53 It'll be cool.
00:14:54 He's like, oh, fine.
00:14:56 So we watched a Serbian film, a movie that not only should you never watch with your
00:15:01 parents, but some might argue you should never watch ever, like in general.
00:15:06 My dad was, he was absolutely mortified.
00:15:09 I'd never seen him in the state of being before where he was.
00:15:13 He was just like, like he was possessed by some like demonic ghost and he was just like
00:15:17 an empty shell of a human being.
00:15:19 So if you want to hear that podcast, it's like an hour and 10 or 20 minutes long.
00:15:24 And my dad probably says three sentences the whole time because he just, he's so aghast
00:15:31 at the film that I forced him to watch.
00:15:33 The fact that he's there though and saying nothing, I think would really add an ambiance
00:15:37 to a video like that, knowing that a dad is there, silently observing this shit.
00:15:41 I'd like to see that.
00:15:44 Yeah.
00:15:45 That's, you know, that's what our podcast needs.
00:15:46 We need a dad.
00:15:47 I would really spice things up.
00:15:49 Oh my God.
00:15:50 You've been kidnapping them lately.
00:15:51 I know.
00:15:52 You got to spare some.
00:15:53 I do have a few that I could spare, but they're, they're a rare breed, dude.
00:15:58 They're a rare breed.
00:15:59 Dads are a rare breed.
00:16:01 They're like diamonds, you know, out there.
00:16:03 They're like 30% of the population.
00:16:06 They're rare.
00:16:07 All right.
00:16:08 A good dad is rare.
00:16:09 We should, we should say non-rapist dads, you know, because most of them, you know.
00:16:12 Who's the best kinds?
00:16:15 So the one time my mom was in a video was during my recent Spyro series, my brother
00:16:20 Pachi was on.
00:16:21 And we thought, you know what'd it be funny if I called my mom on speakerphone and told
00:16:25 her that Pachi was saying bad words?
00:16:31 So naturally when my mom answers, she is absolutely wasted because she loves to just, Friday and
00:16:37 Saturday nights, it's rare that my mom doesn't have a drink.
00:16:40 So the only time my mom probably will ever be recorded in any of my videos is her fucking
00:16:46 plastered and she doesn't even know that it happened.
00:16:49 That poor woman.
00:16:50 That poor woman.
00:16:51 She's going to come at you with legal action one of these days.
00:16:53 Watch out.
00:16:54 If she ever finds out.
00:16:55 The episode is called, Munk His Mom If You Want to Find It.
00:16:58 Okay.
00:16:59 Nice.
00:17:00 I'm looking forward to it.
00:17:01 Hippo.
00:17:02 What were you saying?
00:17:03 I didn't say anything.
00:17:04 You said something you piece of shit.
00:17:05 Okay.
00:17:06 Never mind.
00:17:07 Just like we always try to.
00:17:09 Good job.
00:17:10 Hashtag kickmate.
00:17:11 So even though I torture my parents constantly with this retarded bullshit of watching awful
00:17:18 movies and calling them when they're drunk and recording it, they still do whatever they
00:17:24 can I guess to support me.
00:17:26 I mean, just yesterday I moved from Iowa to North Carolina, which is a fucking 17 hour
00:17:33 drive and instead of me wasting like what, $3,000 on movers and shit, my dad's like,
00:17:39 no, I'll just fucking do it.
00:17:41 So we loaded up his truck and me and my mom and dad spent all of yesterday.
00:17:45 We left at 2 AM, got here at about like 8 PM and drove all the way down here and they
00:17:50 helped me move in just because I guess they love me and shit.
00:17:54 I don't know.
00:17:55 It's weird.
00:17:56 I wouldn't do that for somebody.
00:17:57 You know, that's cool.
00:17:59 And when I moved out to Cincinnati from Massachusetts, it was about like a 16 hour drive.
00:18:03 And my mom came with me and we did the same thing.
00:18:06 She helped me move in.
00:18:07 Not the place I'm in now, but like my old apartment and what a sweetheart.
00:18:11 Yeah.
00:18:12 It's really nice.
00:18:13 I really like parents who do that shit.
00:18:14 And the weirdest part is at least Bam Margera is a millionaire and can give his parents
00:18:19 money, but I have fucking nothing.
00:18:20 So I'm just doing it for no reason.
00:18:23 You have something far more valuable.
00:18:25 Minor internet fame.
00:18:28 Hashtag kick monkey.
00:18:30 Yeah.
00:18:32 So that's pretty much while administering that kick, you would accidentally kick me.
00:18:36 Yeah, not only are our names similar, but we look similar too.
00:18:41 Yeah.
00:18:42 And that's pretty much all I.
00:18:43 You are the same guy.
00:18:44 That's, you know.
00:18:45 Right.
00:18:46 That's all I really have to say about my parents unless you guys had more questions like we
00:18:49 did for Hippo.
00:18:50 Yeah.
00:18:51 Oh, we already said what you fucking, are they ready killed as fuck?
00:18:59 Well, the first time I ever voted in a presidential election was this last one because it was
00:19:04 the first time I was old enough because the last Obama election, I was only 17.
00:19:10 But me and my dad went together and we both voted for Donald Trump.
00:19:14 So I guess you can say my dad is read as fuck.
00:19:17 I'm just curious, does that mean your mom didn't vote?
00:19:20 My mom, I think is no pilled because she knows literally nothing.
00:19:25 She didn't know which political party Michelle Obama would have been associated with.
00:19:32 That's how little she knows about the entire process.
00:19:35 So no, she did not vote.
00:19:36 Would you say that your mother is an object?
00:19:38 She is a woman.
00:19:40 Right.
00:19:41 Okay.
00:19:42 All right.
00:19:43 Okay.
00:19:44 I see.
00:19:45 Good to know.
00:19:46 Excellent.
00:19:47 All right.
00:19:48 Well, we now have a thorough understanding of a monkey's parents political views.
00:19:50 Excellent.
00:19:51 That's what I was hoping to get.
00:19:52 How about Tom?
00:19:54 I know you've got stuff to say about parents.
00:19:57 Yeah.
00:19:58 How about a dog?
00:19:59 How about it?
00:20:00 I have, I mean, my parents, I love them.
00:20:03 They love, they would, they'd go to war for me.
00:20:05 But there's no need to lie here.
00:20:06 There's no need to lie.
00:20:07 No.
00:20:08 I mean, I have this, this like this confusing relationship, I suppose.
00:20:14 Because my dad, like it's interesting, they were talking about having like your parents
00:20:19 and videos.
00:20:20 I did a whole series of videos with my dad two years ago.
00:20:24 Godzilla shit, right?
00:20:25 Yeah, we did.
00:20:26 Because like, oh yeah, we grew up, I grew up watching Godzilla all the time and Ultraman
00:20:29 like all these fucking cheesy shit because my dad's like a nerd in denial because he's
00:20:34 a nerd, but he was also a fat kid in high school and got bullied, so he's like, fuck
00:20:37 this and he got super fucking ripped, turned into a ninja and kicks ass now.
00:20:41 So you're like, nice.
00:20:42 He pretends to be that, but on the inside he's still.
00:20:44 Does he run the ninja school that Hippo applied for?
00:20:46 Actually, you know, I wouldn't be surprised.
00:20:50 He like, he told me one time that like in college, he had like these like ninja things
00:20:54 so like climb walls just climbed on the top of his dorm just because he could, like just
00:21:00 for shits and giggles and like trained with the black dragons and like could kill people
00:21:04 with his bare hands and shit.
00:21:05 Wait, what?
00:21:06 What's the black dragon?
00:21:07 Black people?
00:21:08 Yeah.
00:21:09 I mean, it's the most hardcore thing you can do.
00:21:11 Man, he got away with his life.
00:21:12 He met black people and lived.
00:21:15 Fucking crazy.
00:21:16 Wow.
00:21:17 No, but like my dad, like if you want to talk about someone who's red pill, my dad is
00:21:20 like the stereotypical, like red pill conservative.
00:21:24 Like he's an outdoorsman.
00:21:25 He has guns.
00:21:26 He has fucking crossbows.
00:21:28 Just super.
00:21:29 Crossbows.
00:21:30 So red-pilled.
00:21:31 No, like the outdoorsman kind of archetypal kind of, kind of like, you know, wants to
00:21:39 drive.
00:21:40 Usually drives a pickup truck.
00:21:41 Doesn't have one right now.
00:21:42 But like that kind of guy, but he's also a fucking dork at the same time and to talk
00:21:47 about Godzilla for like three hours or something.
00:21:51 So my relationship with my dad's pretty good.
00:21:54 Pretty cool.
00:21:56 He's also an author.
00:21:57 He's written like five books now, I think, and he's published.
00:22:01 He has like an actual publisher and shit.
00:22:02 Like small time.
00:22:03 But very...
00:22:04 That's awesome.
00:22:05 And then like, I don't know how he does it.
00:22:07 Like I feel...
00:22:08 My dad makes me feel like a retard because like I'm sitting here trying to do stuff and
00:22:11 I have like my whole schedule open and he like works 60 hours a week and wrote like
00:22:15 five books in his spare time.
00:22:17 It was like, huh, where...
00:22:19 I did not inherit that work that sucks.
00:22:23 Teach me your ways and that kind of shit.
00:22:24 Like, fuck it.
00:22:26 But the downside is that because he's so like conservative, he can't like nobody in the
00:22:33 house really understands what I'm doing and they're all just like, but you can't move
00:22:38 out.
00:22:39 So clearly you're not...
00:22:40 This isn't good.
00:22:41 Like this isn't working.
00:22:42 You need to get like a real job and be a real boy and stop doing this.
00:22:46 And my mom is way more aggressive about that because my dad has like a creative outlet.
00:22:50 Like he writes and stuff.
00:22:52 So he understands kind of like, even though like what I'm doing doesn't make enough money.
00:22:57 He understands why I'm doing it because he actually has passions and he's like, he wants
00:23:00 his books to succeed and if he could, he would just sit, you know, and write all day.
00:23:05 My mom doesn't have that.
00:23:08 She doesn't have that...
00:23:09 We had an argument today about me doing creative stuff and she just like, it's like, well,
00:23:15 right, you're fucking miserable in a failure right now.
00:23:17 So you might as well be miserable in a failure at a real job and actually get money.
00:23:20 What are you getting out of this?
00:23:21 And just like, yeah, you know, doing something I like has no value.
00:23:24 Right?
00:23:25 It was, it was dumb.
00:23:26 That's fascinating.
00:23:30 That's really a fascinating perspective on life.
00:23:32 Well, if you want to understand my mom and how it works is that the reason I started my
00:23:41 Patreon and started like monetizing my content in the first place because I got fired from
00:23:45 my job that I had after college because I was working full time at Whole Foods doing graphic
00:23:51 design stuff for them.
00:23:52 Rolling in red bank bro.
00:23:54 Very blue pill.
00:23:55 Working at Whole Foods.
00:23:56 The very blue pill.
00:23:57 The bluest of blue pill.
00:23:58 I did not fit in there at all.
00:24:01 But I got fired from that job because I was too red pill and I'd like to think that.
00:24:07 But I started doing Patreon and my mom in particular was freaking out because I have
00:24:12 student loans to pay because I made the foolish mistake of going to college.
00:24:16 She's like, it's been like three months, you haven't looked for a job.
00:24:19 How are you, you're going to run out of money.
00:24:21 How are you paying for these things?
00:24:22 I just find I said, oh, I have this Patreon thing and I got money and like people like
00:24:27 I'm succeeding.
00:24:28 I'm like, I'm following my dreams and it's working and I have money and people care about
00:24:32 it.
00:24:33 Like this is amazing.
00:24:35 Well, now you can pay us rent and took like half of the money, the entirety that like
00:24:39 I was successful and never asked for, never asked for rent before or since, but the one
00:24:45 time I was successful, she needed to siphon half of my money.
00:24:49 And when I asked about it, it was because, oh, you weren't working towards anything.
00:24:54 So we decided to charge you rent.
00:24:56 If you were actually, if you had a real job and we had some sort of plan, we would stop
00:25:00 charging you rent.
00:25:01 That's why we haven't charged your sister rent.
00:25:03 You know, I sort of understand that logic, but it just shows a fundamental misunderstanding
00:25:07 of what you're trying to do is really what's going on there.
00:25:09 The whole thing that I didn't, I didn't like it's because like their excuse was that, is
00:25:13 that we gave you a year rent free and then started charging you rent.
00:25:17 And I'm like, the timeline kind of worked on that because I, because I was like, why
00:25:21 aren't you charging my sister for rent?
00:25:22 Cause she just graduated college at this time, like two, three years ago.
00:25:27 And they're like, well, she's going to get a year rent free and then she has to pay too.
00:25:30 Never happened.
00:25:31 So I'm, I'm completely.
00:25:32 Yeah.
00:25:33 Well, that's just not, that's fucking, that's deceit.
00:25:35 So, so I'm just, I'm just convinced that it was, um, trying to.
00:25:41 Psychological warfare.
00:25:42 Yeah, exactly.
00:25:43 Well, yeah.
00:25:44 There's, there's no, there's no.
00:25:45 They're trying to pressure you into like one of these, yeah, another path that that seems
00:25:48 clear to me.
00:25:49 So I mean, my mom, my mom's really, she's, she's like done like a personality 180.
00:25:52 She used to be super religious, maybe go to church till all the 16, CCD, all that shit,
00:25:56 hardcore.
00:25:57 Like, uh, I was, I, all my friends got into magic gathering and I've saved up my allowance
00:26:02 to buy a bunch of cards and then she's like, actually, these are the devil and took them
00:26:05 from me and burned them.
00:26:06 Oh boy.
00:26:07 Burned them.
00:26:08 Yeah.
00:26:09 And then.
00:26:10 Whoa.
00:26:11 And then got rid of.
00:26:12 Red pill.
00:26:13 That is pretty red pill.
00:26:14 That's true.
00:26:15 That's true.
00:26:16 Got rid of my Harry Potter books.
00:26:17 I still haven't read the rest of them.
00:26:18 Um, so I don't know.
00:26:19 You're not.
00:26:20 You still haven't read the rest.
00:26:21 Oh no.
00:26:22 It's a long lasting impact.
00:26:23 I don't, I don't know anything about that shit.
00:26:26 So that, and, but now she's like turned into this like a party animal and just goes drinking
00:26:30 like all the time.
00:26:32 Jesus drank.
00:26:33 Jesus was into that shit.
00:26:34 That's consistent.
00:26:35 So I don't, I don't really know.
00:26:36 I don't really understand her.
00:26:37 We have like a working like, like relationship, but that's about it.
00:26:41 Yeah.
00:26:42 Uh, we don't see eye to eye at all.
00:26:43 And she stole like a lot of money from me for no reason and, uh, I don't take kindly
00:26:49 to that.
00:26:50 Is this like a separate thing or is the same issue?
00:26:53 No, it's, it's, I mean, we, we have a problem.
00:26:55 I mean, if she just walked into your room, beat you up and took two grand, like that's
00:26:58 a separate offense to, you know.
00:27:01 Like Tom ever had two grand.
00:27:03 Yeah.
00:27:04 That's funny.
00:27:05 Yeah.
00:27:06 You think I have money?
00:27:07 No.
00:27:08 Um, it would just be like she'll ask for money and then won't pay it back.
00:27:12 And when I asked for it back, she'll deny that it never happened.
00:27:15 So she, I am sensing that there's some mental gymnastics going on in this person that is
00:27:20 justifying some things that are being done that may not as strictly adhere to the laws
00:27:25 of logic.
00:27:26 Um, well, she's also the person who, uh, disconnects the wifi every night because she's
00:27:30 convinced that she can't sleep with it on, even though we're in range of seven other
00:27:34 wifi networks besides the one in our house.
00:27:36 What the fuck?
00:27:37 Hey, you know, can I comment on that real quick?
00:27:38 There is a real illness called something I forget.
00:27:42 It's where people think that electrical, uh, like for us all season one and two.
00:27:47 Oh, that, that's right.
00:27:48 Is that thing people?
00:27:49 Yeah.
00:27:50 That's exactly who the thing I'm thinking of.
00:27:51 Maybe it's true that if she thinks it's on, it will cause her pain because she thinks
00:27:55 it's that way.
00:27:56 Maybe she's got that thing.
00:27:57 I don't know.
00:27:58 Maybe.
00:27:59 I don't know.
00:28:00 Because I, I mean, I use my phone as a wifi network all the time when the wifi's off.
00:28:04 So there's a wifi network right there anyway.
00:28:07 Yeah, right.
00:28:08 Right.
00:28:09 And nobody cares.
00:28:10 So I don't,
00:28:11 How has nobody in your family tested her and said, okay, we're going to put the wifi
00:28:14 in the other room.
00:28:15 You tell us if it's on and then see what happens.
00:28:17 You don't have to raise these things.
00:28:18 The thing, the thing with my mom is that you can't fight with her.
00:28:22 You can't, you can't do it.
00:28:24 She, you, you try and have a discussion and it instantly falls apart and then you turn
00:28:28 into a horrible person and it's, that's the thing with parents, man, and this is like
00:28:31 the big thing.
00:28:32 They're, they're the authority.
00:28:34 If you, I mean, especially if you live with them and you financially depend on them, what
00:28:37 are you going to do?
00:28:38 They, they, they hold all the cards.
00:28:39 They can just fucking kick you out.
00:28:41 If you go against them too hard.
00:28:42 Get a dad who isn't a pussy and beat her ass.
00:28:45 Get a dad.
00:28:46 Yeah.
00:28:47 Go out.
00:28:48 Go, go talk to Munchy.
00:28:49 He's got plenty of dads that you can swap out.
00:28:50 Okay.
00:28:51 Can I borrow a dad?
00:28:52 I, it's like puts like a, like a, like a note across the table, Tom.
00:28:56 It may interest you to know, Tom, that killing women is actually good for your Christ consciousness.
00:29:03 Whoa.
00:29:04 It's not actually, it doesn't actually negatively impact your Christ consciousness.
00:29:07 In fact, it makes it go up.
00:29:10 This, this changes everything.
00:29:11 I think that before the Muhammad consciousness, not Christ.
00:29:14 Yeah.
00:29:15 Well, no, that's true.
00:29:16 Mumpgee, you dog fuck, as I explained before, Christ consciousness has nothing to do with
00:29:21 Jesus Christ.
00:29:22 It has everything to do with crystals, the Christal light.
00:29:25 That's right.
00:29:26 The Christal lights.
00:29:27 My Christals.
00:29:28 Oh man.
00:29:29 This is some hardcore lore.
00:29:32 This is good to know.
00:29:33 Yeah.
00:29:34 This lore is too retarded for my brain.
00:29:35 My J.O. Christals.
00:29:36 All I'm saying, Tom, is to kill you all.
00:29:41 J.O. Christals.
00:29:42 Okay.
00:29:43 Wow.
00:29:44 You know.
00:29:45 Oh yeah.
00:29:46 It's killing your mom because she's a bitch.
00:29:47 All you need is more money.
00:29:48 What Tom needs is more money.
00:29:49 Yeah.
00:29:50 He needs more money.
00:29:51 He needs all of these problems here.
00:29:52 It only had some sort of a platform for you to donate money to him.
00:29:57 Oh wait.
00:29:58 Take it away, Tom.
00:30:00 I've actually, I've changed my old Patreon to patreon.com slash save me.
00:30:05 That's the actual URL.
00:30:06 Really?
00:30:07 Really?
00:30:08 Whoa.
00:30:09 That's awesome.
00:30:10 I can't believe that wasn't taken.
00:30:11 I was surprised too.
00:30:12 I guess no one is begging on Patreon as hard as I wanted to start doing.
00:30:17 Patreon.com slash save me for Tommy Oliver.
00:30:20 Please.
00:30:21 Please go.
00:30:22 Press one for death.
00:30:24 We need one of those like this animal fucking died because no one gave you shit.
00:30:30 But then, the armistice allowed him Oliver.
00:30:33 And that guy is in way worse shape right now.
00:30:35 In the arms of an angel, how would I get through one night without you if I believe in you?
00:30:46 Don't stop believing.
00:30:48 Oh, oh, oh, monkey.
00:30:50 I'm gonna start singing and then you get that ready.
00:30:52 You get that ready.
00:30:53 You get that ready.
00:30:54 Okay.
00:30:55 I'm getting it ready.
00:30:56 I'm getting it ready.
00:30:57 I know what you mean.
00:30:58 How could I go through one night without you if I had to live without you?
00:31:03 What kind of life would that, there it goes.
00:31:08 I wonder if people could tell what that was when I tried to quit.
00:31:11 We are familiar.
00:31:12 I bet it's famous.
00:31:13 It's world famous.
00:31:14 Okay, Tom, any further points you'd like to add?
00:31:20 No, I think that's pretty much it.
00:31:23 But I, fuck it, patreon.com slash save me.
00:31:28 Yeah.
00:31:29 I love that.
00:31:30 I love that.
00:31:31 God, who's that?
00:31:33 Munchy.
00:31:34 Munchy, what's up?
00:31:35 Tell us about your hot Mexican mom who isn't Mexican.
00:31:37 Yeah, it's upsetting, upsetting to say the least.
00:31:43 My mother is the only parent that I will discuss currently.
00:31:48 And she's a nice person.
00:31:50 But I'm your dad.
00:31:51 Well, I know.
00:31:52 Ergo, why would I need to talk about Munchy?
00:31:55 You all know him.
00:31:56 He makes the same five jokes over and over again.
00:31:58 He doesn't have any worthwhile content.
00:32:00 You all know him already.
00:32:02 Munchy, we should do a grandparents episode where you just talk about my parents.
00:32:07 Yeah, we should.
00:32:09 That's a good idea.
00:32:11 Your dad, pretty good, gonna be stolen soon though.
00:32:15 No.
00:32:16 My mom don't know.
00:32:17 No, I needed him.
00:32:20 He's mine now.
00:32:21 I'll hold some ransom.
00:32:24 If you can get me five doubloons, I'll give you back your dad.
00:32:27 How many Christ conscious crystals is that?
00:32:30 It's like about like 50 or so comprised of 10 different doubloons.
00:32:35 I've only got like zero.
00:32:36 Yeah, because you're a fucking fag.
00:32:38 Okay, so go on.
00:32:40 What about your folks?
00:32:41 No, I think we gotta keep this shitty meme train going for another five minutes.
00:32:45 I can't take any more, all right.
00:32:48 Tell me about your mom.
00:32:50 My mom is a nice person.
00:32:52 She's always been a pretty fucking soft bitch.
00:32:57 She's not hitting the gridiron every day on the b-ball court.
00:33:02 Okay, that's all right.
00:33:04 But she's a really nice person and she doesn't hate me.
00:33:08 There are ergo.
00:33:10 She's okay.
00:33:11 One of the few.
00:33:12 If she were to stand in my way, she would be evaporated.
00:33:15 However, she's minding her own business and therefore she shall live to see another day.
00:33:26 Reasonable.
00:33:27 I think the big question, Monchi, the question on everybody's mind is what sort of parents
00:33:35 slash parents would allow their 15 slash 16 year old son to fly out to something called
00:33:41 a radcon full of a bunch of former bronies in their mid 20s who are probably gonna molest
00:33:47 their son.
00:33:48 I mean, you're right about that.
00:33:49 But even like two years, I think before that, he was allowed to fly, or maybe even three,
00:33:53 I can't remember, when he was like 13, he was flying out to bronicon across the entire
00:33:57 country just to fucking goof around with a bunch of pedophiles.
00:34:03 How did you convince your mom to let you do that?
00:34:06 Two words, punitive damages.
00:34:17 Can you go into more detail on that?
00:34:20 What more punitive you need, he just spelled it out for you.
00:34:25 All right, I'm done.
00:34:26 What's a punitive damage?
00:34:29 You know, he was offended or there was a civil trial and he won and his mom had to give him
00:34:34 billions of dollars to fly to bronicon.
00:34:36 Oh, exactly.
00:34:37 What was the trial from?
00:34:39 Well, there's a lot of cereal.
00:34:42 You ate too much cereal.
00:34:45 Oh, I thought you ate too much cereal and you sued your mother.
00:34:48 No, no, no.
00:34:49 Yeah, correct.
00:34:50 Okay, good.
00:34:56 That's the one.
00:34:57 I know that one.
00:34:58 I know that song.
00:34:59 I know it.
00:35:00 It's real.
00:35:02 I was opposed to a fake song.
00:35:07 It's real.
00:35:08 I know it.
00:35:09 You made my four local come out of my mouth when you said that.
00:35:13 You only knew underpants because now they're soaked in four loco.
00:35:16 My undertails are soaked in piss.
00:35:20 Oh, no.
00:35:22 Okay, fucking my mom.
00:35:24 The reason why all that was allowed to transpire was because I just explained myself properly
00:35:29 and she was like, yeah, I've trained you to be self descent from when you were like three.
00:35:33 Right.
00:35:34 But not how to pronounce things.
00:35:35 Yeah, but unfortunately, you inherited retard talks.
00:35:39 Maybe if she had been born in this country and hadn't hopped the wall
00:35:43 to infiltrate this America.
00:35:46 Maybe you'd be able to speak properly.
00:35:48 She's one of the rare Mexican immigrants who was white and jumped over the wall.
00:35:52 That's right.
00:35:54 Yeah, exactly.
00:35:55 He was raised in Mexico City.
00:35:57 He didn't illegally immigrate.
00:36:00 That's what you think.
00:36:01 All immigration is illegal, Mumky, especially in Mexico.
00:36:06 What does CK mean in Spanish?
00:36:09 Cock.
00:36:10 I don't know.
00:36:12 Yeah, there you go.
00:36:14 That means yes, cock.
00:36:16 So, you know, one thing I was curious about.
00:36:18 So just specifically, I was curious about the finances of your trips, Mumky.
00:36:22 Munchy.
00:36:23 God, fucking dammit.
00:36:25 I'm sorry.
00:36:26 So, I know that you do a lot of entrepreneurial type of work,
00:36:31 mowing lawns and shit.
00:36:32 Yes.
00:36:33 Have you had all along your trips been self-financed?
00:36:35 No.
00:36:36 Like, okay.
00:36:38 I've been to three bronycons, I think.
00:36:41 Yeah, that sounds right.
00:36:42 And the first bronycon was completely,
00:36:44 the pizza's here!
00:36:45 The pizza's here!
00:36:46 The pizza's here!
00:36:47 You guys, I can finish the story as Munchy since we're the same person,
00:36:51 if that's okay.
00:36:52 Yeah, please do.
00:36:53 So, my mum, I went up to her when I was 12,
00:36:56 and I said, hey, mum, I want to go with the bronycon.
00:36:59 And she said, well,
00:37:01 what level is your Christ consciousness, son?
00:37:03 And I said,
00:37:04 There's the dog delivery man.
00:37:06 I'm really excited.
00:37:07 They live in the Rick and Morty episode where dogs become sentient,
00:37:11 and they're like walking around with their robotic legs,
00:37:13 and they deliver pizzas and shit.
00:37:14 And yet they're still serving humans by delivering pizza.
00:37:17 Well, they know, they gotta make a living like everybody else.
00:37:19 Yeah, this is an alternate universe where they became friends.
00:37:21 It's not like a universe that would spawn something like Munchy.
00:37:24 Are you sure this isn't just Mexico, and that's where Munchy actually lives?
00:37:28 In Mexico, it's like the Amazon drone program where drones deliver your packages,
00:37:33 instead they tie it to a dog and just make it dirty.
00:37:36 What do you think about it?
00:37:37 He's in California, that's basically becoming Mexico right now.
00:37:39 That's right, it's been absorbed.
00:37:40 I'm pretty sure Trump's signing the legislation as we speak for it to be absorbed.
00:37:44 No, he would sign to stop that.
00:37:46 He wouldn't make it happen.
00:37:47 No, there's too many Mexicans there already.
00:37:49 It's a lost cause, it's gone.
00:37:50 He's gonna put a wall around California.
00:37:53 California, that's right.
00:37:54 I guess they didn't vote for him.
00:37:56 Possibly the whole West, yeah.
00:37:57 California is way too liberal though.
00:37:59 We should put up a wall.
00:38:00 It is.
00:38:01 You guys want us to see from the union?
00:38:03 Fine, wall.
00:38:04 You should put a wall between every state border.
00:38:08 That'd be, yeah, I mean.
00:38:10 And then through, and then a wall all the way around the ocean of the U.S.
00:38:17 and then the border to Canada as well and then just put a roof on it.
00:38:21 You know what we really need to do?
00:38:22 We need to put a wall around the actual barrier that matters,
00:38:25 around the entire earth to keep those real illegal aliens out of our country
00:38:28 because those guys, I don't want them anywhere near my earth.
00:38:31 We need to block out the sun like they did in The Matrix,
00:38:33 put a giant cement wall around the entire earth.
00:38:35 Do you remember when the aliens illegally immigrated to Roswell, New Mexico?
00:38:38 Fuck those guys.
00:38:39 That was bullshit.
00:38:40 That was bullshit.
00:38:41 They're still under arrest.
00:38:42 They're stealing our fucking jobs.
00:38:43 They never left.
00:38:44 They never left.
00:38:45 They dropped anchor babies and now they're hanging out.
00:38:49 They're getting subsidized by the government in a secret lab that we can't go to.
00:39:00 Hey guys, this is me, Munchy.
00:39:02 Hey, Mumpeat, what's going on?
00:39:06 Okay, okay.
00:39:08 Munchy, important question before we get started.
00:39:11 Pan pizza or stuffed crust?
00:39:13 Stuffed crust, baby.
00:39:15 Fuck yeah, dude.
00:39:17 Press one for stuffed crust.
00:39:20 No, there's too many ones in the comments.
00:39:22 Make it stop.
00:39:23 There's so many.
00:39:24 You can't make it stop, Mumpeat.
00:39:26 If you look at it in a different way, there's just a bunch of 11s instead.
00:39:31 In fact, nine sets of 11s.
00:39:34 Press 11 for Munchy.
00:39:36 At least nine sets of 11.
00:39:38 11 is a very racist term against the Japanese people in Code Geass.
00:39:43 But anyway, Munchy...
00:39:44 What were you asking me?
00:39:45 The finances or something?
00:39:47 Fuck, yeah.
00:39:48 How did you pay for your trips?
00:39:50 That's what I was curious about.
00:39:51 Oh, okay.
00:39:52 The first running counter was completely her.
00:39:53 And then like, I think it was like, for the second trip it was like the hotel and her
00:40:00 ticket was on her and I just had to pay for like 75% of my ticket.
00:40:05 And then for the third one, just the hotel was her and I paid for both tickets.
00:40:10 She had to attend as well for the Bronycons because she was like, you know, kind of fucking
00:40:16 weird.
00:40:17 But then for Radcon and future installments of the shit, I just paid for myself.
00:40:22 Wait a minute.
00:40:23 Wait a minute.
00:40:24 You're saying that your mom was at Bronycon?
00:40:26 Yes.
00:40:27 What the fuck?
00:40:28 Did she stay in the hotel?
00:40:29 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:40:30 Well, she didn't attend Bronycon.
00:40:32 She was just at the hotel.
00:40:33 Did she get Tara Strong's signature?
00:40:35 Yeah.
00:40:36 It's funny you mentioned that actually.
00:40:38 One poster is directed directly towards my mom because she stood in line for me at Bronycon
00:40:46 2012.
00:40:47 Oh, that's pretty nice.
00:40:48 She stood in line for me to get a poster because I wanted to do something else.
00:40:52 And the voice actor assigned it to her and said, my mom was awesome.
00:40:57 And then she was like, hey, I was like, yeah, you know what, my mom is awesome.
00:41:02 Which voice actor was this?
00:41:04 It was some fucking bitch.
00:41:06 Was it Andrea Libman?
00:41:08 No, it was Andrea Hussie.
00:41:11 No, no, it was the one that Digi almost killed.
00:41:14 Oh, that's Jeff.
00:41:16 Nicole Oliver.
00:41:17 Hey, that's cool.
00:41:18 But it was his birthday, bitch.
00:41:22 It's my birthday, bitch.
00:41:25 Did Digi just walk in the room?
00:41:28 Dude, you need to watch this video that GiveMate of this event that happened, Momkey, if you
00:41:33 haven't seen it.
00:41:34 Oh, I've seen it.
00:41:35 It is legendary.
00:41:36 Oh, OK.
00:41:37 You better fucking believe us.
00:41:38 I watched all the Bronycon episodes.
00:41:39 Good man.
00:41:40 They're all good.
00:41:41 They're all good.
00:41:42 That wouldn't say that.
00:41:43 How else would he have gotten the elusive content of me looking at the camera intensely
00:41:48 for his Procrastinators episode?
00:41:50 Yeah, yeah.
00:41:51 That's true.
00:41:52 That's true.
00:41:53 And I saw the footage of all you fuckers up on a stage yelling cuss words at a crowd full
00:41:57 of children.
00:41:58 I was like, why did you do this?
00:42:00 That was mostly Digi who yelled the sways.
00:42:02 He was drunk as fuck.
00:42:03 Why?
00:42:04 Because he was drunk.
00:42:05 Dude, imagine.
00:42:06 Dude, imagine.
00:42:07 It's Bronycon.
00:42:08 There's tons of kids there.
00:42:09 And all these fucking assholes in there, like early 20s, jumping on stage yelling fuck
00:42:13 at the kids.
00:42:14 Kids there.
00:42:15 It's Digibro's fucking birthday, Bronycon's birthday.
00:42:20 Yep.
00:42:21 It was pretty fabulous.
00:42:22 We need to have a fucking Bronycon.
00:42:24 I love that place.
00:42:25 We need to have our own Bronycon.
00:42:27 We need to have our own Bronycon.
00:42:30 I was curious about one thing, Munchy.
00:42:32 And specifically, I'm curious about your relationship with your mom.
00:42:36 So your mom paid for your trip the first time.
00:42:38 I'm curious.
00:42:39 Because I feel like a lot of kids-
00:42:41 Brony curious.
00:42:42 When they're-
00:42:43 I don't know how to say that.
00:42:45 You weren't there.
00:42:46 Oh, no.
00:42:47 That's our word.
00:42:48 That's our word.
00:42:49 He's been saying, but forget it.
00:42:52 No.
00:42:53 So, like, your mom was kind of like expecting you to pay more of your way as you got older.
00:42:58 Did you have any resistance to that?
00:42:59 Were you an entitled little shit?
00:43:01 And we were like, no, mom, you paid for everything for the rest of my life.
00:43:05 I literally want to shit in my pants and have you change it my entire life, mom.
00:43:08 Well, did Jess just walk in the room?
00:43:10 Of course I wanted to shit my pants and piss on my walls.
00:43:14 But that's unrelated to the money.
00:43:17 I just wanted to do that with my own accord.
00:43:19 And she agreed.
00:43:20 Okay.
00:43:21 I offered to pay more money.
00:43:24 That's, you know, I expected something like that.
00:43:26 You are an unusually mature guy when it comes to a personal responsibility, Munchie.
00:43:30 And that is to be commended, I think.
00:43:33 Thank you, bitch.
00:43:37 Piss on my walls.
00:43:40 So other than pissing on your walls, are there any other parents-related stories you want to tell?
00:43:46 Well, the thing that there's not like a lot of stories, because while me and my mother are like close in the sense that we like like each other,
00:43:53 like she has out from the set, like out from the fucking do is to try to do, make me be like my own guy.
00:44:02 And so she's always trying to make me like self-suspicion.
00:44:05 So we don't really like, we used to do like stuff together, but we don't like do anything together anymore.
00:44:10 I know what you mean.
00:44:11 Which is fine.
00:44:13 Yeah, so there's not really a lot of stories.
00:44:15 Oh, besides the one time where we almost were stuck over the border in Mexico.
00:44:19 Oh, right.
00:44:20 Yeah, why don't you tell that real quick?
00:44:22 That's a fascinating story.
00:44:24 I am of mud-blood descent as stated earlier.
00:44:29 I'm very low on the fucking hemospectrum.
00:44:33 And my mother was like, you know, Tijuana's fucking sick, bro.
00:44:37 And I was like, fuck yeah, bro.
00:44:38 And you know, like you want to go to Tijuana?
00:44:40 I was like, fuck yeah, bro.
00:44:41 And then she was like, sick, bro.
00:44:43 I like your mom's vocabulary.
00:44:47 Where do you think Munchie got it off?
00:44:50 So we went to Tijuana and then we're like, all right, it's pretty fucking bad actually.
00:44:55 Let's go home.
00:44:57 And then-
00:44:58 The end.
00:45:00 Because you went there for the whores in the gambling.
00:45:03 That's the problem.
00:45:04 Exactly.
00:45:05 The whores and I did pet-hit.
00:45:06 But other than that, it was a total failure.
00:45:08 No, no, no.
00:45:09 Not a horse.
00:45:10 A whore's the whore.
00:45:11 Nate, he knows what you fucking said.
00:45:13 Yeah.
00:45:14 Okay, good.
00:45:15 Wow, Nate.
00:45:16 Thanks.
00:45:17 It's almost like you're bin-sane, LOL.
00:45:19 Please take that back.
00:45:21 It's a terrible traffic burn.
00:45:22 Anyway, when we were about to leave, my mom was like, oh yeah, I didn't bring your passport,
00:45:25 by the way.
00:45:26 I was like.
00:45:27 Oh, no.
00:45:28 Thanks, mom.
00:45:29 I always want to live here forever and never go home.
00:45:34 Yeah, right, okay.
00:45:35 It's a secret way to try and get rid of you.
00:45:38 By the way, I don't know if this is this for all of the border, but that particular day,
00:45:44 there was this weird dystopian line to get to the US.
00:45:49 It was a fucking photo of a Russian bread line.
00:45:53 I see.
00:45:54 It was just a singular gate to get into the US.
00:45:57 We had to wait in this line for two hours, and then my mom had to just reason with the
00:46:02 guard.
00:46:03 He looks like I just picked him up from over here, but he's on the other side.
00:46:07 Please don't kill me, Mr. Donald Trump.
00:46:09 I'm clairvoyant.
00:46:10 I can see in the future.
00:46:12 Well, Trump was working borders.
00:46:14 Yeah, man.
00:46:15 He knew his future would involve it heavily.
00:46:18 Yeah, he knows his stuff.
00:46:19 He knows exactly how it works.
00:46:23 So what, did you get arrested or what?
00:46:25 No, he was just like, hmm, what age are you?
00:46:28 And I was like, oh, I don't know.
00:46:29 And then it was like, where do you go to school?
00:46:32 I don't know.
00:46:33 And then it was like, yeah, sounds legit.
00:46:37 Yeah.
00:46:38 And I was like, yeah, yeah.
00:46:40 That sounds good.
00:46:42 And then he was like, all right, fucking leave my side, bitch.
00:46:45 He walked over to this side and all was happily ever the after.
00:46:50 Now, real quick munch.
00:46:53 It's not that well known, but there is a fan wiki about the PCP.
00:46:58 And there's an entry about your mother, Munchie.
00:47:00 If you don't mind me reading it.
00:47:01 Oh, wait.
00:47:02 OK.
00:47:03 Yeah, I'm going to read it right now.
00:47:05 It says, Munchie's mom was the founder and former leader of the Crystal Gems,
00:47:10 enthralled by the beauty of Earth.
00:47:12 Munchie's mom led her friends and allies in a rebellion against the gem homeworld
00:47:17 around 5,500 years before the events of the series,
00:47:21 successfully driving the invading homeworld gems off the planet
00:47:25 and saving the life forms inhabiting it.
00:47:28 Beautiful stuff.
00:47:29 Yeah.
00:47:30 I mean, she did do that.
00:47:32 She is a fat whale.
00:47:34 So, you know, it matches up.
00:47:37 They forgot to add that she is a gigantic slut
00:47:40 who will fuck any fucking shit with a car wash, you know, anyone.
00:47:45 Like, yeah, big slut, big slut.
00:47:48 Yeah, that's all true.
00:47:50 And she's dead now.
00:47:51 LOL, get fucked.
00:47:52 Yeah, got him, got him.
00:47:54 Except for, like, in these weird inside your lion memories shit.
00:47:59 I only saw that episode once.
00:48:00 I don't know what's going on.
00:48:01 I didn't know you even fucking watched that show.
00:48:03 I've seen, like, the first 30 episodes, and then maybe I'll watch the rest someday.
00:48:07 It's pretty good.
00:48:08 It's pretty good.
00:48:09 Yeah, I like it.
00:48:10 Munchie's life, the show that is.
00:48:11 I like Munchie's life, the show.
00:48:12 Oh, that fucking reminds me.
00:48:14 I almost forgot I hate Nate.
00:48:17 Here's why.
00:48:18 Yeah, OK.
00:48:19 On the Steven Universe episode, you were going to have me.
00:48:22 You were going to wake up later than when you messaged me.
00:48:26 Wasn't that, like, episode two?
00:48:27 Yeah.
00:48:28 It was way early, yeah.
00:48:29 And I didn't get to be on, and I forever haunted your nightmares.
00:48:32 Oh, I remember that.
00:48:33 I remember that, because you were fucking late.
00:48:35 I can't wait all day for your latest videos.
00:48:37 You told me that day, Nate!
00:48:39 I didn't know you were supposed to be early.
00:48:42 Maybe we'll do a follow-up one day.
00:48:44 Maybe, I don't know.
00:48:45 You want to be a Steven Universe?
00:48:47 Yeah, like, episode two is Steven Universe, the PCP.
00:48:50 Oh, my God.
00:48:51 That's when we all drew Crystal Gems for ourselves and put in the intro that I animated so beautifully.
00:48:56 No.
00:48:57 It just, yeah, that's Steven Universe.
00:48:59 See, Jesse and Digi did it like a gem cast.
00:49:03 Oh, you guys did one, too.
00:49:04 You guys did one, too.
00:49:05 That was a separate one.
00:49:08 On the horse thing.
00:49:09 Yeah, there you go.
00:49:10 Anyway, yeah, a fucking sick story.
00:49:14 Yeah, I think that's all I have to say.
00:49:16 She's a nice person.
00:49:18 Get the fuck out of my old sight, woman.
00:49:21 How's that pizza, Munchie?
00:49:23 Let me get my pizza.
00:49:25 Hold on.
00:49:26 I didn't want to eat, because I didn't want to ruin the world.
00:49:27 Ah, it's going to go cold.
00:49:28 Fuck this podcast.
00:49:29 Here, here.
00:49:30 Hey, guys, welcome to Stealing Your Dad.
00:49:31 It's definitely as easy.
00:49:32 I'm going to take this, Mr. Bit, and upload it on my channel.
00:49:35 Is that Pizza Hut?
00:49:36 Is that Pizza Hut?
00:49:37 You got there?
00:49:38 I'm going to do a...
00:49:39 Here.
00:49:40 Wait, wait, Munchie.
00:49:41 You can't do that.
00:49:42 You can't do that.
00:49:43 What kind of toppings do you get on your pizza, Munchie?
00:49:52 What...
00:49:53 Is that...
00:49:54 Just tell me if that's Pizza Hut.
00:49:55 That is Pizza Hut, right?
00:49:56 I need to know.
00:49:57 Okay, okay.
00:49:58 Munchie, what kind of pizza did you get?
00:50:00 Meatlovers.
00:50:01 Oh, hell yeah.
00:50:02 You would.
00:50:03 You literal gay lemal.
00:50:05 Now, Nate, before we go to your parents, I have a confusing question.
00:50:11 It doesn't really make sense to me.
00:50:12 It's like a paradox because somehow your parents raised you and you're arguably one of the
00:50:18 best guys ever.
00:50:19 Some might even say the best guy ever.
00:50:21 That's true.
00:50:22 But at the same time, your parents raised Ben St. Arguably the worst guy ever.
00:50:29 Most would argue the actual worst guy ever.
00:50:32 So how did this happen?
00:50:34 Where did your parents fuck up in the timeline?
00:50:37 Well, you know, it's a freak thing.
00:50:38 It's kind of like, you know, leukemia can kind of crop up just genetically.
00:50:42 You put two different people together.
00:50:44 One of their kids, you know, is perfectly healthy.
00:50:46 The other's got a crippling illness like Ben does just personality-wise.
00:50:49 Retardation?
00:50:50 Yeah, yeah.
00:50:51 I thought it was that like Nate like siphoned off all of the goodness, all of the good vibes
00:50:58 from Ben's corpse is living corpse.
00:51:01 That is true.
00:51:02 And now you're the better guy than him.
00:51:04 Ben's like a Dark Souls player that I ganked in the womb and absorb his humanity.
00:51:11 And now he's a hollow shell of a man.
00:51:13 That's why you won the race.
00:51:15 It's no coincidence that Nate is a Holocaust survivor and Nate is Hitler.
00:51:21 That's right.
00:51:22 It's no coincidence.
00:51:23 Also, Hitler, the most famous Holocaust survivor.
00:51:26 That's been a great job.
00:51:28 There are too many things wrong with that statement.
00:51:36 I know.
00:51:37 I don't even want to unpack it because it's so brilliantly stupid.
00:51:41 Yeah, let the viewers do it at home.
00:51:44 Well, I don't know, man.
00:51:47 Nate, by the way, real quick, what did you just like say that again?
00:51:51 Because something popped up in my memory and I was going to say it really quickly,
00:51:54 but I also can't remember what you just said.
00:51:56 You said it all really fast.
00:51:58 Like a Holocaust survivor, Hitler?
00:52:00 No, no, no, back about your parents.
00:52:02 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:52:04 All of my family has cancer.
00:52:06 I'm probably going to have cancer by the time I die.
00:52:08 Is that true?
00:52:09 Yeah, that's true.
00:52:10 This is like in a movie, like a detective movie where the character says,
00:52:13 no, say that again and then it refreshes his memory and he solves the mystery
00:52:16 from some innocuous bullshit that the other guy said.
00:52:19 That's true.
00:52:20 I didn't think it would ever happen in real life.
00:52:21 The killer is Jane.
00:52:22 It's like, I'm going to die.
00:52:25 Which arguably a better ending.
00:52:27 There you go.
00:52:28 Oh, you've been saying, oh, you.
00:52:31 Oh, no, best of luck with that much.
00:52:33 Anyway, so I don't have that much to say about my parents.
00:52:36 I don't know.
00:52:37 Enough.
00:52:38 Pretty normal.
00:52:39 Yeah.
00:52:40 My dad is a psychologist.
00:52:42 He's a smart boy.
00:52:43 He's a psycho.
00:52:44 Yeah, he's a psycho.
00:52:46 My mom's a special ed teacher and they met like working at a place.
00:52:52 She has special ed.
00:52:54 Well, no.
00:52:55 I imagine she spent a lot of time with Ben.
00:53:00 You might say they were the perfect parents to try to raise a perfect son,
00:53:03 which succeeded one time, did not work out so well the other time.
00:53:07 Ben's the older brother.
00:53:09 So it's like he was the test run and then all the stuff they learned from him,
00:53:12 they used on you to make you a good son.
00:53:14 Ben's like the proto man and I'm like the mega man who's better in every way.
00:53:17 The proto man won at the end of the Sons of Death or the Sons of Fate.
00:53:23 He won the battle, but not the war of autism, which he has.
00:53:27 We'll see it back three if it comes out.
00:53:29 That's true.
00:53:30 Isn't like a mega man a fucking faggot?
00:53:32 Isn't that good?
00:53:34 Yeah, I can confirm.
00:53:35 That's true.
00:53:36 That's true.
00:53:37 All right, continue.
00:53:38 If anyone interrupts again, I'll kill them.
00:53:41 Oh, shit.
00:53:42 Good.
00:53:43 I was just going to say.
00:53:44 Enough.
00:53:45 Did not see that coming.
00:53:48 God damn it.
00:53:50 Yeah, I don't know.
00:53:51 They met like doing like working with special ed kids, but in any case.
00:53:55 How did they, how did they work with Ben before they met?
00:54:00 Before that's one of the great questions of our time.
00:54:03 It doesn't make any fucking sense.
00:54:06 Ben's a retarded time traveler.
00:54:11 I'm sorry, I'll stop.
00:54:13 I just fucking hate Ben so much.
00:54:16 I understand.
00:54:17 That is totally relatable to my parents.
00:54:19 They would sympathize very much so with that.
00:54:22 Yeah, I don't know.
00:54:23 I don't have a lot to say.
00:54:25 They're pretty great.
00:54:26 They're pretty great to me.
00:54:27 They've given me pretty much anything I wanted in life.
00:54:30 They never did anything particularly bad to me.
00:54:33 I don't know.
00:54:34 I have an older brother and younger sister.
00:54:36 We were all raised middle class.
00:54:38 It was good, man.
00:54:39 It was good.
00:54:40 I don't have any kind of crazy stories really because everything was totally normal and
00:54:44 not interesting.
00:54:45 Ben's in another PCP with Digi and Ben.
00:54:50 I remember that a little bit.
00:54:52 Only about his dad, about how he's kind of cool but also gay.
00:54:56 Kind of stern.
00:54:57 Yeah.
00:54:58 My mom kind of takes-
00:54:59 And he's ashamed of Ben's career choice.
00:55:01 He's just ashamed of Ben, period.
00:55:03 You know what?
00:55:04 Okay, that's a good jumping off point.
00:55:05 My dad is not ashamed of Ben's career choice at all.
00:55:09 I think he would really support anything that any of us do.
00:55:12 He's simply an incredibly practical guy and only cares.
00:55:16 You can do whatever you want but first you've got to meet your responsibilities of paying
00:55:20 the fucking bills.
00:55:21 So he's mad at us.
00:55:22 That's just life.
00:55:23 That's just how to live.
00:55:24 Don't tie everything like that.
00:55:25 I think it's a fool.
00:55:27 I'm on Team Dad.
00:55:29 Team Nate Dad.
00:55:30 That's sexist.
00:55:31 Right now, Ben's doing better.
00:55:34 My dad just worries that Ben won't be able to pay his bills or whatever.
00:55:37 That's all he cares about.
00:55:39 My sister is a tattoo artist.
00:55:41 She hates tattoos.
00:55:42 My mom too.
00:55:43 They hate the idea of tattooing.
00:55:44 My sister is a fucking tattoo artist.
00:55:47 Kind of like not what they're into.
00:55:48 But they've pretty much gotten over it and are just happy that she can support herself
00:55:52 doing something she's happy with.
00:55:54 In that respect, they're pretty chill.
00:55:57 One thing I've noticed is that my dad was really controlling when we were young.
00:56:02 He's the kind of guy who always believes he's right and usually is.
00:56:06 That kind of reinforces his desire to always be in charge of shit.
00:56:11 But as I've gotten older and gotten out of his thumb, gotten out from under his thumb,
00:56:15 and I think this is probably true of most people becoming an independent adult,
00:56:19 I feel a lot less of that shit.
00:56:21 His overbearing presence has lessened greatly and I can just kind of appreciate him.
00:56:25 He's kind of become a real person as opposed to an authority figure in my life.
00:56:30 I like him a lot more that way.
00:56:32 It's much easier to interact with him.
00:56:34 Because when you're a kid and you're growing up and you have a controlling dad,
00:56:37 it's easy to forget that he's also capable of being fun and doing cool shit.
00:56:43 I just see more and more of that as time goes on and he's not my boss anymore.
00:56:49 And it's nice.
00:56:51 It's a nice thing I'm trying to communicate.
00:56:53 I didn't really mention this about my dad.
00:56:55 Not really the controlling, but he believes he's right a lot of the time.
00:57:03 Just today, he misheard something I said and he would not believe that he misheard it.
00:57:10 He said that I didn't say the thing and it really made me mad.
00:57:14 What was the thing? I need to know now.
00:57:16 It was about the draw cast.
00:57:20 It was about the draw cast we were recording earlier.
00:57:22 I said, oh, I'm going to be on a draw cast.
00:57:24 I'm going to be on a podcast in 45 minutes.
00:57:26 And then that's going to take a couple hours and dinner wait until after that.
00:57:33 Or should I change it?
00:57:34 And he said, no, that's fine.
00:57:35 He thought I meant, like, could it wait an hour or 45 minutes?
00:57:40 And then that's why that is not really that interesting.
00:57:43 It just annoyed me that he would not consider the fact that he misheard me.
00:57:50 I know what you mean.
00:57:51 It's just stuff like that.
00:57:53 But it's interesting when I hear like, look at people interacting with their parents as if they're just interacting with a friend or like me or like someone.
00:58:05 It's weird. I don't act like I do around my parents the way I do around my friends.
00:58:11 I'm more so recently because they see my YouTube videos.
00:58:15 They see what I'm like when I'm not, you know, like being reserved.
00:58:19 You know what I mean?
00:58:20 I do.
00:58:21 That's that's a fascinating thing I observed.
00:58:23 Even when I was a kid, like, yeah, like this is what I was trying to say this before.
00:58:27 But like, when you see the way you're like my dad, especially my dad is very, he can be very high strung.
00:58:33 And like, when I was a kid, he was, you know, he was high strung.
00:58:37 But then when I would see him like, whatever I would go with him like to work on like the extremely rare chance I would see him like out just like doing his business.
00:58:43 He was like such a nice guy to everybody he met.
00:58:46 And it was like unbelievable to me that he was like this kind of guy out in the world was like such a sweetheart because like he works with a lot of old folks.
00:58:54 He's like a, you know, he does like elder counseling and shit now.
00:58:57 And he's done for like 20 years at this point, but that's his thing.
00:59:00 And like, he's just such a fucking softy to them.
00:59:04 I mean, you know, he still does his job.
00:59:06 But even not to them, but like to the nurses he interacts with to everybody else.
00:59:10 He seemed like such a nice guy.
00:59:12 And then when he would come home and just be like, why are these, you know, he wouldn't swear.
00:59:16 But like, this is just me in my voice explaining what he would say.
00:59:18 Why are there fucking dishes not done?
00:59:20 What the fuck is this shit?
00:59:22 Like I come home and nobody's done anything.
00:59:24 I have to do everything when I get home.
00:59:25 This is bullshit.
00:59:26 You know, he'd say it in much nicer language.
00:59:28 This world.
00:59:29 Yeah.
00:59:30 Yeah.
00:59:31 And he would pull out that gun and just end it all.
00:59:33 Every single day.
00:59:35 Every day.
00:59:36 Every day.
00:59:37 He's unfortunately the invincible man, which is a big downside for him and his suicidal tendencies.
00:59:41 But yeah, you know, that's, that's, that's the funny thing about parents.
00:59:46 The way that as kids you perceive them versus the way they, they are sort of agents out in the world separate from that.
00:59:53 Total can be like hugely different, which I find very interesting.
00:59:58 And now that I'm an adult and get into a place where I'm becoming more of their equal as opposed to their, you know, not subservient, but you know, their child exclusively,
01:00:06 I'm able to understand that they kind of are put in a role where they, at least my dad, kind of felt he had to be the authoritarian.
01:00:15 And I could tell he never liked doing that.
01:00:18 He was, he never liked having to like punish us or be strict with us.
01:00:23 He would even, he would like tell us like, I hate, you know, having to fucking enforce these rules and shit.
01:00:27 But you guys got to learn, be responsible and take initiative and do all that kind of shit.
01:00:32 And I think it kind of eventually sunk in a little bit, I guess.
01:00:37 I've got a little bit more of a work ethic than I did when I was young.
01:00:40 But, you know, yeah.
01:00:43 I feel like your dad and my dad would get along. We should have a dad cussed.
01:00:47 Just like a sibling cuss, yeah.
01:00:49 And I would sneak in and fucking nab a bitch.
01:00:53 It's a danger to gather too many dads in one place with Munchie around.
01:00:57 That's a big risk that we'd be taking.
01:01:00 But I agree. I think our dads would get along great.
01:01:02 My dad is very much a dad, if you know what I mean.
01:01:06 Like 100% dad.
01:01:08 Well, actually, that's what I'm saying.
01:01:10 Like he's gotten a little bit less daddy and more chill dude-y in recent years.
01:01:15 And I think the fact that all his kids don't live with him anymore, he's finally free.
01:01:19 Which I don't think he's like super thrilled about.
01:01:21 I think he kind of misses having people around.
01:01:23 But nonetheless, like we're all out doing our own shit now.
01:01:25 And I can tell he's able to loosen up a little bit, you know?
01:01:31 You imagine what it feels like to just like-
01:01:33 Is his voice he loosened up any at all? Do you know?
01:01:35 I'll let you know next time I go visit.
01:01:37 Alright, thanks.
01:01:40 You ever think how like weird it is?
01:01:42 Like you're like a young man and then you get a wife and you have kids
01:01:47 and then your life is all about raising these kids to a certain age.
01:01:51 Like for 20 years probably.
01:01:53 And then they all leave and then suddenly you find yourself in a space-
01:01:58 With the sort of free time you would have had when you're like a young man at 25 or whatever.
01:02:04 I know exactly what you mean.
01:02:06 And then suddenly it's like, oh, what happened? Where am I?
01:02:10 What could that be like? It's probably very strange.
01:02:14 I bet it is extremely strange.
01:02:16 And like we've got this big house in Massachusetts that's now mostly empty most of the time.
01:02:22 Because it's just two people living there instead of like five.
01:02:25 Yeah, it's a big change, man.
01:02:27 I mean my dad is the kind of guy who plans like decades ahead.
01:02:31 And he's got schemes, he's got things to occupy him.
01:02:36 I mean my mom's retiring at the end of this school year, I think.
01:02:39 And my dad's retired in, I don't know, like a handful of years more.
01:02:42 And they have plenty of savings.
01:02:45 They are going to be just fine with their savings because my dad is on that shit.
01:02:51 And he's got me to start a 401K already.
01:02:54 And it's going, it's my fucking company, it's feeding into it every paycheck.
01:02:59 And yeah, I don't know, he's just like the most responsible guy in the world.
01:03:04 And that's been a big strength to him, like career-wise and like economically.
01:03:10 But also probably cost him a little bit of fun he could have had in his life.
01:03:14 I mean it still can.
01:03:15 And hopefully he will now, now that he's got more opportunities to do so.
01:03:18 You know, I really am happy that I can get older and understand where the way he's,
01:03:23 the way he like was a dude.
01:03:25 And like hearing about stories when he was a kid, like the shit he used to get into.
01:03:28 Like he was like a huge Monty Python fan when he was a kid.
01:03:32 And I didn't even really know until like a couple years ago when I heard Ben mention it,
01:03:36 like talking about my dad.
01:03:38 And like him and his buddy Asa, who you know, is like his friend from like elementary school
01:03:43 that he's still friends with.
01:03:45 They used to fucking quote that shit all the time to each other.
01:03:49 And they went across like England, having adventures together a couple times.
01:03:53 And they did all kinds of crazy shit.
01:03:55 And it's just really cool to learn about your parents as people, as opposed to authoritarians.
01:04:03 I really like it.
01:04:04 But parents feel like fathers because women are not people.
01:04:08 Well, you know, that's the thing.
01:04:10 I was, I feel a little bit guilty even saying this because I'm not focusing on my mom so much.
01:04:14 It's just that my mom's been a very passive person, you know, in like the relationship.
01:04:20 My mom was always kind of the one who did not take initiative to like do stuff.
01:04:25 She would, she's not a bitch.
01:04:28 She would, she'd be very supportive when there was things we wanted to do.
01:04:31 But she was very, she was dimmier, I suppose I'd say she was.
01:04:35 Are you sure that your family isn't Muslim?
01:04:37 Because it sounds very Muslim.
01:04:39 Muslim? No, she's, unfortunately, she's a disgraceful white woman.
01:04:43 Oh, no.
01:04:45 White people can't be Muslim, Nate.
01:04:47 What the fuck?
01:04:48 Well, not with their hair all, you know, sledding out in the sun.
01:04:51 Jesus Christ.
01:04:52 Somebody fucking mute this guy.
01:04:54 Whoever edits this, just edit Nate's fucking audio out of this podcast.
01:04:59 Nate, please.
01:05:00 Please.
01:05:01 And this.
01:05:02 Yeah, I don't know.
01:05:03 You should call your dad up and tell him you've been fucking my dog.
01:05:08 You bitch.
01:05:09 Pretty sure that's allowed in Islam.
01:05:11 Pretty sure.
01:05:12 All right.
01:05:13 That's it.
01:05:14 You're thinking about goats.
01:05:15 That same thing.
01:05:16 Same thing.
01:05:17 Dogs and goats.
01:05:18 Little known fact, same thing.
01:05:20 Hippo, what were you saying?
01:05:22 Yeah, I was saying like what you were saying about like your stories of your dad as a young man.
01:05:28 Like my dad has like a, I really like dad stories because he, my dad is good at telling stories.
01:05:34 You know, at the dinner table, like after, you know, we're done.
01:05:37 We're just sitting there just like, ah, nice.
01:05:39 And then he starts just, you know, I remember a thing and he tells us and he's always really good at telling it.
01:05:46 And he has so many like stories of him being like a really like a rough house, ruffian kid with his friends that would beat people up and scare people.
01:05:54 Wow.
01:05:55 That's awesome.
01:05:56 There was this really cool one where he was like, you know, he blew up his science class in his Christian class and he went outside.
01:06:05 Oh, probably.
01:06:09 And then there was like this one where he, him and his friends, there was like this one stairwell to this certain part of the school.
01:06:16 And he and his friends locked arms at the top of the stairs and they would not let anybody pass for like two hours.
01:06:21 Wow.
01:06:22 That's commitment to a fucking joke.
01:06:25 They really got in trouble, but it was great.
01:06:27 Yeah.
01:06:28 It's just sort of like, you know, old London, like, I don't know, 50s, 60s sort of cool, cool rough boys.
01:06:36 Upside down land.
01:06:39 Yeah, that's right.
01:06:41 It's cool.
01:06:42 Was that?
01:06:43 Old dad stories are really cool.
01:06:44 I'm imagining that's the Tower of London and the Queen is trying to pass.
01:06:48 She's like, oh, get out of my way, you ruffians.
01:06:52 And they're like, no, Goughna can't do it.
01:06:54 And the police can't do shit about it because those cucks don't carry weapons.
01:06:58 That's right.
01:06:59 They'll fucking get, they'll fucking get claws on the god.
01:07:01 I'll get you kids whips out small water gun.
01:07:05 No guns aren't allowed.
01:07:07 Oh yeah, whips out butter knife.
01:07:09 Oh wait, knives aren't allowed either.
01:07:10 That's knives are not allowed.
01:07:11 Whips out finger.
01:07:12 That's, that's a very, uh,
01:07:14 And they wag their finger.
01:07:16 Yeah.
01:07:17 It sounds like a very British attack is like wagging somebody.
01:07:20 Even that's dangerously phallic, a.k.a. patriarchy.
01:07:23 So we need to stay away from the whole finger wagging thing.
01:07:25 But you know,
01:07:26 Whips out white woman to be raped promptly by our,
01:07:30 by our immigrant friends.
01:07:33 No, no, Brexit passed.
01:07:34 There's no more immigrants in the UK.
01:07:37 That's right.
01:07:38 That's right.
01:07:39 I mean, now that, yeah.
01:07:41 Hey, but I understand the,
01:07:43 the government and the,
01:07:45 and the political structure of your country way better than you.
01:07:47 I know what Brexit does.
01:07:49 I know what Brexit has done is made like immigrants want to come in really quick
01:07:55 before it happens, before it becomes like legal.
01:07:58 So now there's just so many more immigrants.
01:08:00 It's terrible.
01:08:01 Well, actually, I don't know.
01:08:02 I mean, like when, when, when the Brexit's done,
01:08:05 over 20 minutes a day,
01:08:06 do you just see a bunch of the jobs in the street or what?
01:08:08 Well, the thing is,
01:08:09 we've already had like a very multicultural,
01:08:11 at least London.
01:08:13 Like London is very multicultural anyway.
01:08:15 So it's like, I've seen,
01:08:16 I've seen different types of people all the time.
01:08:18 So seeing a bunch more would be like, hey, what am I?
01:08:20 Wait, I forget.
01:08:21 Where do you live?
01:08:22 Do you live near London?
01:08:23 What's your address?
01:08:24 Near London.
01:08:25 Okay.
01:08:26 Yeah, what's your address?
01:08:27 My address is,
01:08:28 One, two, three, Fake Street.
01:08:29 Brett Bong.
01:08:30 Yeah.
01:08:31 One, two, three, Fake Street.
01:08:32 That's what I always say.
01:08:33 Crumpet and T Street.
01:08:34 Do you know the address of the Queen's Palace?
01:08:36 What?
01:08:37 Buckingham Palace.
01:08:38 Yeah.
01:08:39 What's the address?
01:08:40 Google it.
01:08:41 You'll find it.
01:08:42 I was hoping you knew it,
01:08:43 so you could just say you live there.
01:08:44 That would have been it.
01:08:45 What if you were the Prince of England give all along?
01:08:48 Please make that true.
01:08:49 That would be cool for me.
01:08:51 Oh, and then I could,
01:08:52 then I could patron Ben Sain.
01:08:54 No!
01:08:55 Like, zero dollars.
01:08:56 No, there you go.
01:08:57 A little waste of money.
01:08:58 There you go.
01:09:01 Well, that was pretty much it.
01:09:03 Who do you think?
01:09:04 It was probably Munchie.
01:09:05 I don't know why I asked.
01:09:06 With that level of audio clipping,
01:09:07 there's only one man who can fit that,
01:09:09 who can fit that.
01:09:10 He is clipping the band.
01:09:13 So, anybody else want to say anything about their parents,
01:09:16 or should we?
01:09:17 Okay.
01:09:18 Okay.
01:09:19 Well, we got questions too, so.
01:09:20 Yeah.
01:09:21 As a broad thing,
01:09:22 I just need to pass down to you, dear viewers,
01:09:26 the wisdom that I have been passed down by my hero,
01:09:30 the man, the myth, the legend,
01:09:32 Jean Rankowski,
01:09:33 aka, Jace Connors,
01:09:35 aka, part one, dude 91.
01:09:37 The advice is as follows.
01:09:40 Dads.
01:09:41 Get on the ground.
01:09:42 I can't.
01:09:43 I can't.
01:09:44 The movie maker is obviously first.
01:09:45 First one for us.
01:09:46 However, second man.
01:09:47 No!
01:09:48 No!
01:09:49 Munchie enough.
01:09:52 Also, by the way, listen, buddy,
01:09:55 so we have all three of those in quick succession
01:09:57 from one another.
01:09:58 Anyway, as I was fucking saying,
01:10:00 I forgot what, oh, no, okay, okay.
01:10:03 The concept and name and term specifically of dads
01:10:08 are inherently funny in every way.
01:10:11 And therefore, adding dad to the end
01:10:14 of any adjective, noun, or verb
01:10:17 inherently makes that verb or other word
01:10:21 like 10 times as funny.
01:10:22 You can do this with anything.
01:10:23 For instance, friendly dad for 20,
01:10:26 or super daddy,
01:10:29 or wood dad, anything.
01:10:32 It can be anything.
01:10:34 Adding dad to the end makes it better
01:10:36 because dads are just inherently funny.
01:10:38 I've got a good question for everybody to answer
01:10:41 to end this with,
01:10:43 would you become a parent?
01:10:45 Fuck no.
01:10:46 That is a good question.
01:10:47 Okay, we're gonna say no.
01:10:49 I'm definitely never going to have kids,
01:10:52 ever, no way.
01:10:54 Really?
01:10:55 You can quote me on that.
01:10:56 If I ever have kids,
01:10:57 listeners at home,
01:10:59 if I ever have kids,
01:11:00 you have permission to fly out to my house
01:11:02 and literally kill me.
01:11:03 I'll give you my address.
01:11:04 Now, this is a two-part question.
01:11:06 How come?
01:11:07 How do you say that?
01:11:08 Because I'm way too selfish
01:11:09 and I don't want to waste my life
01:11:11 raising some little fuckhead
01:11:12 who looks like me
01:11:13 because I know how bad my genetics are
01:11:15 and I'm not gonna put that curse
01:11:17 on some other innocent human beings.
01:11:19 That's a good point.
01:11:20 You're a terrible human being.
01:11:22 You've all seen me.
01:11:23 You don't want to perpetuate the monkey disease.
01:11:26 Nope, never.
01:11:27 That's true.
01:11:28 Yeah, fuck kids.
01:11:30 What do you say hippo?
01:11:32 Yeah, go ahead and give me.
01:11:34 No, you can fuck kids.
01:11:35 It's okay.
01:11:37 Sex with the young and all.
01:11:38 Well, now that you've told me that, I will.
01:11:40 I mean, technically,
01:11:41 every single person who has sex is a kid
01:11:45 because they're all somebody's child.
01:11:47 Oh, right.
01:11:48 Yeah, that is true.
01:11:49 So fuck you, I was right.
01:11:50 Oh, guys, I forgot to tell you,
01:11:52 this is really fucking important.
01:11:54 This is crazy.
01:11:56 From the South the other day,
01:11:57 if your mom never had children,
01:11:59 you won't either.
01:12:00 How crazy is that?
01:12:03 That's fucking fucked up, bro.
01:12:05 Yeah, probably true.
01:12:06 That's fucked up.
01:12:07 So much of the toilet left, am I right?
01:12:10 God damn it.
01:12:11 That reminds me of that famous screencap
01:12:13 of a little girl, I think,
01:12:15 a food of fucking her mom that says,
01:12:16 I'll take your virginity, mom.
01:12:18 Well, that's a good one.
01:12:20 Tom, what about you?
01:12:21 Are you ever going to have kids after you kill yourself?
01:12:24 What about you, Tom?
01:12:25 Are you going to take your mom's virginity?
01:12:28 Yeah, weigh in on that, please.
01:12:31 I mean, about having kids,
01:12:35 basically, I'm in the same position as Momgie.
01:12:38 I'm too selfish.
01:12:40 I have too much.
01:12:41 I think me and Tom are the same person in a lot of ways.
01:12:44 We have a lot of similarities, I feel.
01:12:46 But no, it was exactly the same.
01:12:48 I wouldn't want to fucking have kids,
01:12:49 because I think I have an interesting perspective,
01:12:53 because my parents...
01:12:55 Didn't want to have you.
01:12:57 No, they didn't.
01:12:58 I was literally in an accident.
01:13:00 I almost died when I was born,
01:13:01 and they should have just let it happen.
01:13:03 Wow, OK.
01:13:04 Would have saved me some trouble.
01:13:05 Oh, shit.
01:13:06 You know, that should not impact.
01:13:07 That doesn't matter.
01:13:08 Totally irrelevant.
01:13:09 No, I think it's important.
01:13:10 Don't worry about it.
01:13:11 I feel like a lot of people, like,
01:13:12 sincerely will get upset,
01:13:13 even if they don't say it,
01:13:14 that they were in an accident or that it wasn't tended.
01:13:16 I hope that's not the case with you, Tom,
01:13:18 because it doesn't matter.
01:13:19 You're worthy, and I like you,
01:13:21 and your existence has value.
01:13:22 I think it's safe to assume that the majority of
01:13:24 first-born kids are probably in an accident,
01:13:27 but then the parents are like,
01:13:28 oh, fuck it, we were going to do this anyway.
01:13:29 Let's just do it.
01:13:30 I think most kids are accidents in general.
01:13:32 Am I wrong about that?
01:13:33 I mean, probably, I don't know.
01:13:35 Whole human species was a genetic accident.
01:13:37 Wait a minute.
01:13:38 It's just a surprise.
01:13:40 I think, yeah, all right.
01:13:42 Well, the thing, the point I was going to make
01:13:44 is that my parents had me,
01:13:47 then two years later, they had my sister,
01:13:49 and then, like, 12 years later,
01:13:51 they had another kid.
01:13:52 Oh, fuck.
01:13:53 So I...
01:13:54 That kid was the accident.
01:13:56 We were all accidents.
01:13:58 So...
01:14:00 My whole life has been an accident,
01:14:02 but, like, just growing up
01:14:05 and, like, being, like,
01:14:07 old enough to, like, see the whole process,
01:14:09 and, like, this is what it is to have a child.
01:14:11 I was like, never.
01:14:13 Never in a million years.
01:14:14 Like, all the people who were romanticized having a kid,
01:14:16 no, I lived through it.
01:14:17 I didn't get to sleep either,
01:14:18 because I had to sleep right next door
01:14:19 where the baby was sleeping.
01:14:20 Right, right.
01:14:21 This is fucking horrible.
01:14:22 So, like, I saw all this shit happen.
01:14:23 Like, I've already had to change diapers and shit.
01:14:25 Fuck that!
01:14:26 I paid my dues.
01:14:27 Not doing it again.
01:14:28 So, no.
01:14:29 I paid my dues.
01:14:30 Never.
01:14:31 I have a unique perspective.
01:14:32 I know exactly what it means.
01:14:33 Time after time.
01:14:34 No.
01:14:36 Okay, alright.
01:14:37 Alright.
01:14:38 Perfectly acceptable answer.
01:14:39 Can we skip over Gip, by the way,
01:14:41 or did I just, like, pass out?
01:14:43 No, we didn't...
01:14:44 Well, he hasn't gone yet,
01:14:45 but we didn't skip him.
01:14:46 Yeah.
01:14:47 Okay, why don't you just go now?
01:14:48 He said he already has kids.
01:14:49 I...
01:14:50 Right.
01:14:51 I am kids.
01:14:52 No.
01:14:53 So, I think I'm unusual in my generation, generally,
01:15:00 that I just...
01:15:01 I like the idea of having kids.
01:15:02 Were you born in lay wrong generation, Gip?
01:15:04 No, no.
01:15:05 What I mean is, like, it's...
01:15:06 Lay wrong generation.
01:15:07 It's very, like...
01:15:08 Oh, that's...
01:15:09 Yeah, it's a very good joke.
01:15:10 Thank you, thank you.
01:15:11 Very, very good name.
01:15:12 Very good name.
01:15:13 I spent a lot of time with that.
01:15:14 I thank you, everyone.
01:15:15 I'm not being sarcastic.
01:15:16 I thought it was really funny.
01:15:17 It is funny.
01:15:18 It's hilarious.
01:15:19 Yeah.
01:15:20 He said it a million times before.
01:15:21 That makes it funnier.
01:15:22 And it's funnier every damn time.
01:15:24 It's like subscribe to Munky Jones.
01:15:26 Everybody in the comments, say subscribe to Munky Jones.
01:15:29 It only gets funnier as it goes on.
01:15:31 Yeah.
01:15:32 Sorry, Gip.
01:15:33 Okay, please.
01:15:34 That was an unconvinced grunt.
01:15:36 Yeah.
01:15:37 Yeah.
01:15:38 I like the idea of having a child.
01:15:42 I don't know whether I like the idea of raising it,
01:15:45 but I like the idea of raising it.
01:15:47 I don't know whether I like the idea of raising it,
01:15:49 but I like the idea of having had raised a child up
01:15:52 and him or her to be like cool.
01:15:55 What age do you think you...
01:15:56 And to have a name that I gave them.
01:15:58 What age would you say is like, like, okay,
01:16:00 it'll be cool to have a kid once they're X,
01:16:02 like 25, like, I don't know, 40.
01:16:04 Just curious.
01:16:05 Oh, well, I think I'd enjoy it.
01:16:07 I think I'd enjoy it once they're not a baby
01:16:09 and they can talk and they can walk around
01:16:11 and be cute and stuff.
01:16:13 Now, Hippo, what if your kid becomes the next
01:16:15 Elliot Roger or like somebody who
01:16:17 kills a bunch of people?
01:16:19 Well, it wasn't because I'm not a terrible father.
01:16:21 The next greatest hero of all time?
01:16:23 Peter Roger was a terrible father.
01:16:25 He was one of the best fathers.
01:16:27 He just gave his son money and said, go.
01:16:29 That's really all you need to do to raise a good son.
01:16:31 Go shoot the people.
01:16:33 Go to the shoot people.
01:16:35 Go on, go to the shoot people.
01:16:37 That's what you need to do.
01:16:39 When you raise your kids, you can't say a lot about the fall.
01:16:41 You know, if Hillary Clinton was president,
01:16:43 Roger would not have killed all those people.
01:16:45 That's right.
01:16:47 Because she would have had sex with him.
01:16:49 Because Obama would not have brainwashed him
01:16:51 with Cory in the house.
01:16:53 It was her time.
01:16:55 That's a world famous YouTube video
01:16:57 of Cory in the house, what's in an OP, right?
01:16:59 No!
01:17:01 The faggot Jeff stole my joke.
01:17:03 He's not a faggot. He's cool.
01:17:05 Now, mine came out in like mid-March
01:17:07 and then his came out April 1st.
01:17:09 So who ripped off who? You tell me.
01:17:11 Oh, fascinating.
01:17:13 And also mine came out way after his, I think.
01:17:17 Yeah.
01:17:19 But mine was actually funny.
01:17:23 I don't know what I'm doing.
01:17:25 So you want to have kids, you're looking forward to it.
01:17:27 It'll be cool. You like all that shit.
01:17:29 Yeah, I like the idea
01:17:31 of being a...
01:17:33 Because I thought about
01:17:35 how you would do it wrong
01:17:37 and how you would do it right.
01:17:39 You've got to prepare for them to rebel.
01:17:41 You've got to accept that
01:17:43 they're going to live in a world
01:17:45 where everything is completely different and weird.
01:17:47 We're living with let's plays
01:17:49 and YouTube and shit
01:17:51 and our parents don't know what the fuck that is.
01:17:53 So when I'm a parent,
01:17:55 if I'm a parent,
01:17:57 my kids are going to be growing up on some weird shit
01:17:59 that I'm going to think is disgusting
01:18:01 and I don't get it.
01:18:03 But I'm going to have to let them do it
01:18:05 because that's the future.
01:18:07 So I've thought about the way
01:18:09 to be a good parent
01:18:11 despite the way that times change.
01:18:13 I don't know. I've thought about it a lot.
01:18:15 I want to be like a cool dad.
01:18:17 Like my dad.
01:18:19 Because he's cool.
01:18:21 I know what you mean.
01:18:23 I kind of empathize with parents
01:18:25 who are like, oh, I can't keep up with what kids are doing.
01:18:27 Because for thousands of years,
01:18:29 human society did not evolve very fast.
01:18:31 Now all of a sudden,
01:18:33 the internet has changed everything about the way we live our lives.
01:18:35 So I get it that people from the 20s
01:18:37 have no fucking idea what's going on
01:18:39 in the world right now.
01:18:41 The people from the 20s are dead.
01:18:43 Not all of them. That's only like 90s.
01:18:45 They're getting close to 100 now.
01:18:47 They don't even know what the internet is from.
01:18:49 Okay, fine. The fucking 40s.
01:18:51 Whatever. It's still big difference.
01:18:53 Big difference.
01:18:55 Yeah. Okay. Anyway.
01:18:57 Mumkey? I mean, Munchy? Same guy?
01:18:59 Munchy? Every time.
01:19:01 Every time. Munchy.
01:19:03 Tell me about your son.
01:19:05 Well, my son
01:19:07 will be named
01:19:09 Mumkey Jones
01:19:11 and I'll kill him.
01:19:13 It's funny that
01:19:15 Hippo wants to be a dad
01:19:17 because he thought his dad was cool.
01:19:19 I want to be a dad because I thought my dad
01:19:21 was a fucking faggot.
01:19:23 Dude, that's the Will Smith approach.
01:19:25 That's the Will Smith approach.
01:19:27 I'm just going to be like, ah, you fucking bitch.
01:19:29 I'll speedrun this shit, LOL.
01:19:31 I'll post this on Twitch.
01:19:33 He's going to be
01:19:35 720 no scoping those dad Olympics.
01:19:37 It's going to be fucking sick.
01:19:39 Alright.
01:19:41 I want to have a child
01:19:43 sometime in the future
01:19:45 once things are
01:19:47 not, you know,
01:19:49 when I'm not a baby myself.
01:19:51 No particular age
01:19:53 and also
01:19:55 if I could
01:19:57 I would just want to
01:19:59 as Hippo said just like fast forward the baby parts
01:20:01 but the baby's parts, I don't think they'll be that bad.
01:20:03 The babies are cute.
01:20:05 Yeah.
01:20:07 They're a bit of a gay
01:20:09 mess, but it's like one or two years.
01:20:11 It's bad.
01:20:13 I know it's bad, but like, you know.
01:20:15 Imagine doing anything for one or two years.
01:20:17 That's,
01:20:19 I'm with you, but I'm just saying that's this a long time.
01:20:21 No, yeah.
01:20:23 I want to be able to like
01:20:25 fucking like make someone
01:20:27 me but cooler.
01:20:29 That's what I'm going to try and accomplish.
01:20:31 How could that happen?
01:20:33 I would just force him to make grills.
01:20:35 Did you become Bill Blossom
01:20:37 for two seconds?
01:20:39 I think the most likely thing to happen
01:20:41 if Munchie, if you stay the way you are
01:20:43 as a parent that your child will be
01:20:45 the most like boring person
01:20:47 in the universe.
01:20:49 Yeah, just to rebel.
01:20:51 But you know, Munchie, I mean Munchie
01:20:53 would die.
01:20:55 Munchie would be the one guy who would be so proud
01:20:57 of his son to get a job at McDonald's
01:20:59 to make those McGriddles.
01:21:01 He wants it so bad.
01:21:03 Instead he'll become like
01:21:05 I want the McGriddles son!
01:21:07 I'm not here for you!
01:21:13 Where are my fucking McGriddles?
01:21:17 Bring them to me!
01:21:19 This is what I trained you for.
01:21:21 This is all you're good for to me.
01:21:23 The fry cook from birth.
01:21:25 The chosen one, yeah.
01:21:27 But instead of doing all that
01:21:29 gay shit
01:21:31 he learns how to become an astronaut
01:21:33 and he fucks away to space.
01:21:35 He'll be very disappointed.
01:21:37 I just wanted my McGriddles.
01:21:39 I just wanted McGriddles.
01:21:41 Fascinating.
01:21:43 No one's commented on this yet,
01:21:45 I don't think.
01:21:47 Because the episode's not out yet.
01:21:49 Bitch,
01:21:51 you are that.
01:21:53 I want to have a kid
01:21:55 but I couldn't even
01:21:57 imagine having a wife.
01:21:59 I know what you mean.
01:22:01 I was going to say something about that.
01:22:03 I would just want to adopt, I guess.
01:22:05 I know the feeling.
01:22:07 That is a thing.
01:22:09 You think this is how I'm going to do it
01:22:11 and then if you meet a significant other
01:22:13 then they have their
01:22:15 plans and you're going to kill each other.
01:22:17 And they're always going to be worse.
01:22:19 It's because
01:22:21 none of us are
01:22:23 actually a stature of monkey,
01:22:25 but none of us as far as I know
01:22:27 are in a serious committed relationship of any kind
01:22:29 where we're really considering anything like that.
01:22:31 It's just way outside my wheelhouse
01:22:33 the idea of committing to someone
01:22:35 for 18 years or whatever the fuck.
01:22:37 Well anyway,
01:22:39 I guess I'll just say
01:22:41 my piece on as well.
01:22:43 For many years
01:22:45 I have known that I will have
01:22:47 for starters, I have seven sexy daughters
01:22:49 to begin with.
01:22:51 And please feed them
01:22:53 by going to patreon.com
01:22:55 It's one of my reward tiers, I think.
01:22:57 Feed my seven daughters. Need to do that shit.
01:22:59 Aside from that,
01:23:01 I plan on having two more children
01:23:03 maybe like 10 years or so.
01:23:05 Charlotte and Vincent,
01:23:07 they're going to be two perfect children
01:23:09 and I'm going to raise them
01:23:11 to better humanity for all.
01:23:13 Because the thing is, nobody's talked about this
01:23:15 I think about things like
01:23:17 the movie Idiocracy a lot
01:23:19 about how the stupidest people breed the most
01:23:21 and make the most worthless swine humans
01:23:23 that don't deserve to live.
01:23:25 I have a duty to breed
01:23:27 and spread my perfect genes
01:23:29 my god-like genes around the rest of humanity
01:23:31 so you guys haven't even been talking about this
01:23:33 but I am serious about this
01:23:35 I need to continue my genetic legacy
01:23:37 because I know I'm the best
01:23:39 because I know that's what humanity needs
01:23:41 to get better, it needs what I've got
01:23:43 to be humanity, anti-humanist
01:23:45 to not reproduce
01:23:47 and continue this perfect thing
01:23:49 I've got going on over here.
01:23:51 I'm selfish so I'm okay with that.
01:23:53 That's true.
01:23:55 I'm fine with the intellect part
01:23:57 but I don't give a shit about genes or anything.
01:23:59 Well, you forget how much
01:24:01 I can fucking bench, dude.
01:24:03 You forget that shit.
01:24:05 But look, the fact that there are so many dumb
01:24:07 stupid swine humans is how
01:24:09 we're going to succeed
01:24:11 and take their money and they won't realize
01:24:13 we just need to have slaves again
01:24:15 what the fuck Abraham Lincoln
01:24:17 That'll work for a while
01:24:19 but I want to get to Starfleet as soon as possible
01:24:21 and in Starfleet you need people to have their shit together
01:24:23 more or less
01:24:25 I'm hoping for that sooner rather than later
01:24:27 You need to build Starfleet out of the pyramids
01:24:29 Out of Minecraft
01:24:31 Yeah, we just need to make
01:24:33 Minecraft real and then we'll have
01:24:35 fucking Starfleet like two seconds
01:24:37 We'll have plenty of Minecraft slave builders
01:24:39 That's all the children of the world
01:24:41 All the kids will do it, man
01:24:43 Yeah, that'd be nice
01:24:45 It would be like Indiana Jones or the Temple of Doom
01:24:47 except, you know, they'll be doing something
01:24:49 I also
01:24:51 like what you were saying, I also wanted to say
01:24:53 I really want to be a dad
01:24:55 There was something that's apropos about this
01:24:57 So today, the day we're recording this
01:24:59 April 1st, 2017 is the
01:25:01 10 year anniversary of Tangentapa Gurun Lagann's release
01:25:05 and that's a special day
01:25:07 for people like me who really care about that series
01:25:09 and I know I always say that Kamina
01:25:11 is like my favorite character
01:25:13 I've had a long time to think about why that is
01:25:15 and I know I've talked about this before
01:25:17 but the point is he is like
01:25:19 the ideal father figure to me
01:25:21 He's like
01:25:23 When I see him, I always talk about how
01:25:25 Kamina is like my favorite anime character ever
01:25:27 which is true, but the point of the show
01:25:29 which is what I said in my Gurun Lagann video
01:25:31 is that Kamina is not perfect
01:25:33 He is a flawed individual
01:25:35 He has these various flaws
01:25:37 that are complimented by someone like Rossiu
01:25:39 and those things kind of combine in Simone
01:25:41 making Simone more or less the perfect guy
01:25:43 not quite, even Simone isn't perfect
01:25:45 but it's about combining different factors
01:25:47 but when I see Kamina
01:25:49 when I see in him this masculine
01:25:51 bravado can do anything
01:25:53 project strength to
01:25:55 make the people around him stronger
01:25:57 this is going to get personal and possibly too deep
01:25:59 but those are the things that I see
01:26:01 myself lacking
01:26:03 when I see a dad like that
01:26:05 or a dad figure, he's not actually Simone's dad
01:26:07 but he serves that function
01:26:09 those are the things I want
01:26:11 and I love that
01:26:13 I want to be that for people
01:26:15 because it's something that I really value
01:26:17 and want to
01:26:19 I don't know, I want to spread that
01:26:21 I want to be the good dad
01:26:23 because I love good dads
01:26:25 good dads are my favorite thing in the world
01:26:27 I have the ability to do that
01:26:29 so I feel it's my obligation to do so
01:26:31 and I hope in 30 years from now
01:26:33 there's a kid making a shitty podcast
01:26:35 who's talking about how cool his dad was
01:26:37 and how he inspired him to be a cool guy
01:26:39 and do cool things even if that only
01:26:41 entailed just you know, birthing him
01:26:43 and then leading him to his own devices
01:26:45 to uh, why, what
01:26:47 what mean were you going to say?
01:26:49 I was just going to say and can like
01:26:51 rapy, that was part of your training right
01:26:53 well, of course
01:26:55 you're right, teaching him the proper rape techniques
01:26:57 as I say
01:26:59 every day, the only true love is between
01:27:01 a boy and a man, that's the goal
01:27:03 and you know
01:27:05 and yeah, I'm really fixated on the dad thing
01:27:07 I want to be a good dad and I
01:27:09 like what you were saying, I don't think about
01:27:11 like the woman I would have to have involved
01:27:13 in this at all, I am not interested
01:27:15 I would be repulsed
01:27:17 I could see myself
01:27:19 I mean, I hate the idea of marriage
01:27:21 it disgusts me, it's really a contract
01:27:23 that keep men locked down
01:27:25 to keep them from leaving, which actually does serve a practical purpose
01:27:27 cause like families
01:27:29 kid, raising children is better off
01:27:31 when the man is not able to leave and is forced
01:27:33 to stay, cause it's in men's best interest
01:27:35 like personally, to just go around and fuck
01:27:37 a million sluts and just you know, be free
01:27:39 but like, a family is better off
01:27:41 when they're kind of forced in place
01:27:43 so like, I get the societal logic
01:27:45 behind marriage that forces men to stay
01:27:47 but I'm pretty uncomfortable with the idea
01:27:49 myself, but I mean, I don't know
01:27:51 maybe I would do something like that
01:27:53 a committed relationship of some kind, to raise kids
01:27:55 but God, do not care
01:27:57 about the woman
01:27:59 well the thing is, I'm trying to raise
01:28:01 the best kids possible
01:28:03 given the current environment
01:28:05 and we don't have starfleet, we don't have any kind of that shit
01:28:07 the best, the best environment
01:28:09 you see statistically, this is a fact
01:28:11 the best kids in America
01:28:13 regardless of like, any kind of background
01:28:15 having a mother and a father
01:28:17 in like, a marriage relationship
01:28:19 brings you the best children, they do the best
01:28:21 like that is the biggest deciding factor
01:28:23 is it like your anti-gay marriage
01:28:25 discussion or what?
01:28:27 no, not at all, I mean, it is actually a fact
01:28:29 that like, mothers and fathers marry do better
01:28:31 statistically
01:28:33 the children of gay couples can be successful and good
01:28:35 well, no, that's not what I'm saying at all
01:28:37 it's more likely
01:28:39 I'm only talking about statistics
01:28:41 like, my dad is
01:28:43 he does a lot of
01:28:45 okay, I admit, I'm basing this on
01:28:47 what my dad has researched
01:28:49 because he's worked with a lot of kids
01:28:51 like people getting divorced and all kinds of like
01:28:53 well, yeah, divorce is going to lead to a fucked up kid probably
01:28:57 well, not just that
01:28:59 it sounds like you should be saying
01:29:01 children who have two
01:29:03 parents rather than mother and father
01:29:05 I don't know
01:29:07 well, but that's just not what the stats show
01:29:09 the children, I mean, it is a fact
01:29:11 that the most ideal situation
01:29:13 the kids who do the best
01:29:15 come from families that are
01:29:17 you know, a traditional marriage
01:29:19 and I don't even support traditional marriage
01:29:21 so don't get me wrong here, I'm not saying that I'm into it
01:29:23 I'm just saying that that's what the facts
01:29:25 are paying out
01:29:27 I think I need to see these stats
01:29:29 because it doesn't make any sense
01:29:31 it's entirely possible that that's because we live in an evil
01:29:33 patriarchy where that kind of relationship
01:29:35 is like, rewarded
01:29:37 whereas gay married couples
01:29:39 do worse, maybe that's totally true
01:29:41 and it is not true, but statistically
01:29:43 that is the fact of the matter
01:29:45 that they do the best
01:29:47 that was true, I would have seen those stats posted
01:29:49 on a lot of the
01:29:51 red-pilled pages that I follow on Twitter
01:29:53 and Facebook because I feel like that
01:29:55 is a stat that they'd want to brag about all the time
01:29:57 well
01:29:59 maybe I'm wrong, I admit
01:30:01 based on what my dad told me, maybe he was wrong
01:30:03 the thing about people posting stuff
01:30:05 is that they don't know anything
01:30:07 so they only post
01:30:09 stuff that gets posted by somebody
01:30:11 who does know about it and I guess nobody
01:30:13 has
01:30:15 I feel like this is undocked about territory
01:30:17 a little bit
01:30:19 it's the sort of thing
01:30:21 people are done
01:30:23 and if they see something that supports their argument
01:30:25 they'll repost it
01:30:27 none of them actually know it offhand
01:30:29 I didn't even mean to bring this up
01:30:31 you can just say divorce
01:30:33 not divorcing
01:30:35 your kids do better when you don't divorce
01:30:37 that's just how it is
01:30:39 that sounds very logical
01:30:41 I understand what you're saying
01:30:43 I say that to myself
01:30:45 in my brain a lot
01:30:47 the way you're coming from
01:30:49 I think it just comes down to a fact
01:30:51 that just like
01:30:53 minorities and shit are just
01:30:55 they aren't a lot of them
01:30:57 so it's harder to
01:30:59 get big old samples
01:31:01 I don't even know how the fuck
01:31:03 we got to this point
01:31:05 we have to wait until Hillary Clinton has her turn
01:31:07 and makes it so that legally
01:31:09 half of families
01:31:11 have to have gay parents
01:31:13 and then we can get the stats that we need
01:31:15 we need that state enforced homosexuality
01:31:17 as soon as possible
01:31:19 that's equal
01:31:21 we gotta have equality
01:31:23 we gotta have equality on this
01:31:25 I got my eye on you munchie
01:31:27 watch the fuck out
01:31:29 alright
01:31:31 real quick Nate
01:31:33 since you mentioned that today is April 1st
01:31:35 I thought it would be important if I said real quick
01:31:41 why is it so short
01:31:45 my favorite meme
01:31:47 we don't want to get content I do
01:31:49 I don't think people plan
01:31:51 guys this is the Kid Icarus show
01:31:53 we have to say if we salvage it or slaughter it
01:31:55 parents
01:31:57 parents
01:31:59 love them or hate them
01:32:01 they're definitely the plebe
01:32:03 they're getting slaughtered
01:32:05 I give them zero rotten tomatoes out of a thousand
01:32:07 oh god
01:32:09 so as per usual
01:32:11 on the tpcrastinator's twitter
01:32:13 we said we needed some questions
01:32:15 no no no
01:32:17 I have something to say
01:32:19 I have something to say
01:32:21 I was going to award them a lot of dads
01:32:23 but I stole them all
01:32:25 they're all gone there's zero dads for dads
01:32:27 they're all gone
01:32:29 when there's no dads available everybody gets a zero dad score
01:32:31 so at Jarisbat wants to know
01:32:33 what are your most controversial
01:32:35 and unpopular anime opinions
01:32:37 and I brought this one up because
01:32:39 this is the worst possible question
01:32:41 oh my god
01:32:43 no I do want to talk about it
01:32:45 you're just fucking with us
01:32:47 I have a good answer
01:32:49 my controversial anime opinion
01:32:51 is that anime is generally boring
01:32:53 oh my god who gives a shit
01:32:55 fine let's just hear your answer monkey
01:32:57 what do you want to say about that
01:32:59 I just wanted to say that I know you anime elitist
01:33:01 would frown upon this opinion
01:33:03 and that's why I want to bring it up
01:33:05 it's probably because I watched it as a kid
01:33:07 but I have a deep
01:33:09 love for Naruto
01:33:11 and I really wish that it was easier to watch
01:33:13 I wish that the entire thing
01:33:15 was dubbed in English and that somebody would
01:33:17 cut out all of the filler episodes
01:33:19 like if there was an abridged version
01:33:21 that just had the important shit
01:33:23 I would watch the fuck out of it
01:33:25 I just love that show
01:33:27 when I graduated college
01:33:29 one of my friends friends that we'd hung out with
01:33:31 he was super big into Naruto
01:33:33 I used to read the manga back
01:33:35 in high school
01:33:37 and I just fell off the bandwagon because it was just so big
01:33:39 and he's like alright dude
01:33:41 I'm going to text message you over the next two weeks
01:33:43 an entire list of all the
01:33:45 episodes you have to watch to skip all the filler
01:33:47 so you can get caught up
01:33:49 I love that he talks like that
01:33:51 he was a fan
01:33:53 the game reviewer
01:33:55 top number one
01:33:57 and he did he gave me this huge fuck
01:33:59 I don't have it anymore I wish I did
01:34:01 was it like a hundred
01:34:03 he's just like you can skip like
01:34:05 20 episodes here, 40 episodes here
01:34:07 I'm just like Jesus Christ
01:34:09 it was funny because I didn't miss a beat
01:34:11 it totally just flowed and I was like this is ridiculous
01:34:13 I think there's some subreddit where they're compiling
01:34:15 all the main episodes
01:34:17 and they're cutting out the filler
01:34:19 so if somebody can like remind me what that is
01:34:21 I think I might waste some time watching Naruto
01:34:23 you know there's this thing called one pace
01:34:25 I remember I mentioned it a long time ago
01:34:27 but there's this one pace
01:34:29 it's exactly what it sounds like
01:34:31 it's one piece only they cut out
01:34:33 all the bullshit from every episode and speed it up
01:34:35 and only leave parts that are decent
01:34:37 it's like each episode is now two minutes long
01:34:39 they're like maybe 15, 15 to 20
01:34:41 a lot of stuff generally happens
01:34:43 but one piece anime is garbage
01:34:45 and it's such long pans all the time
01:34:47 it's terrible they fix all that shit
01:34:49 and leave only the important stuff
01:34:51 that's like back in the day they had this thing
01:34:53 all fight no filler, did you ever see those
01:34:55 way back in early YouTube
01:34:57 spliced together all the big fight scenes
01:34:59 from like Dragon Ball and stuff
01:35:01 that's funny because I don't even care about fight scenes
01:35:03 I would rather see like okay they start fighting
01:35:05 and immediately jump to the conclusion
01:35:07 because I do not care about the actual fighting that happens
01:35:09 the reason I bring it up because they had the Goku vs Frieza fight
01:35:11 it was like 16 hours long
01:35:13 and when he said the planet would blow up
01:35:15 in 5 minutes there was like another 7 hours
01:35:17 oh yeah
01:35:19 that's pretty fun
01:35:21 that's my favorite
01:35:23 people exaggerate that
01:35:25 after he says that
01:35:27 it was hours of content
01:35:29 after he says the planet will blow up in 5 minutes
01:35:31 7 hours though
01:35:33 it was something like 7 hours
01:35:35 it was a good like
01:35:37 third to half of the fight
01:35:39 was after he destroyed
01:35:41 just tries to destroy the planet
01:35:43 there's nobody else really
01:35:45 have a controversial anime
01:35:47 opinion I thought it was actually a good question
01:35:49 but you don't have to fucking
01:35:51 kill yourself I like you
01:35:53 don't kill yourself
01:35:55 I have a controversial anime opinion
01:35:57 that's kind of relevant to the last anime review
01:35:59 yeah fuck you Nate trying to shit on that question
01:36:01 we all like it
01:36:03 go on
01:36:05 Dom what do you got
01:36:07 I think that the original full battle is way better than brotherhood
01:36:09 I thought brotherhood was gay
01:36:11 and I hated it
01:36:13 what the fuck
01:36:15 have you completed both
01:36:17 can you tell me why
01:36:19 without using buzzwords
01:36:21 like it was gay
01:36:23 yes well the main problem
01:36:25 that I had with brotherhood
01:36:27 was that
01:36:29 it felt very kind of like
01:36:31 by the books one of the things I was really interested in
01:36:33 yeah it was by the book that's why it's better
01:36:35 because it was based off the book
01:36:37 well no because like the thing
01:36:39 I guess the thing that I was really interested in
01:36:41 with the original full battle
01:36:43 is what they did with the homunculi
01:36:45 and how they wanted to be human as well
01:36:47 because it was an interesting way to like
01:36:49 foil what Ed and Howard were chasing
01:36:51 the entire time because they wanted to be human
01:36:53 and they couldn't understand
01:36:55 why the homunculi wanted to be human
01:36:57 because they'd be like so much weaker
01:36:59 when the fact of the matter is like
01:37:01 their quest for being human would inherently weaken them as well
01:37:03 so it's the protagonist and antagonist
01:37:05 basically chasing the same thing
01:37:07 and the way that they kind of clashed ideologically
01:37:09 and couldn't kind of see past each other's differences
01:37:11 even though inherently they wanted the same thing
01:37:13 I thought that was a really interesting dynamic
01:37:15 that's a pretty cool point
01:37:17 I'm just like we just want to kill people
01:37:19 these are just flat boring typical show
01:37:21 no no no no no no
01:37:23 greed in full metal alchemist brotherhood
01:37:25 is the best fucking character of any show I've ever seen
01:37:27 he's like the same in both though
01:37:29 he's still a great character
01:37:31 no he's not the same in brotherhood
01:37:33 but greed's the best out of both of them in both interpretations
01:37:35 and greed I would give greed more credit
01:37:37 than really anybody else
01:37:39 but the majority of them
01:37:41 I really like to fact how like
01:37:43 my controversial opinion
01:37:45 full metal alchemist brotherhood
01:37:47 or full metal alchemist and I don't plan to
01:37:49 because there's I don't care
01:37:51 that's okay that's fine don't worry about it
01:37:53 they're not that good
01:37:55 my controversial version of this
01:37:57 also the Aryan race
01:37:59 this I'm going to keep talking over you
01:38:01 oh you told me
01:38:03 how to talk over people
01:38:05 you're going to have a puff in if you don't
01:38:07 and I won't respect your
01:38:09 ability to talk
01:38:11 okay so what's your anime
01:38:13 my anime
01:38:15 is that I would like to watch more
01:38:17 but they're too long
01:38:19 and I think
01:38:21 some of them are good
01:38:23 but I've only watched like 7 and I don't really intend
01:38:25 to watch anymore dude why would you say that
01:38:27 that's too controversial for the show that's too controversial
01:38:29 the people can't handle that kind of opinion
01:38:31 too controversial this question
01:38:33 sucks oh god damn it
01:38:35 I uh
01:38:37 do I have a fucking controversial no I don't have any
01:38:39 and the Kirby anime is legitimately
01:38:41 better than like
01:38:43 3 of the 7 anime I've seen
01:38:45 that's probably true
01:38:49 okay Nate let's see you pick a good question
01:38:51 you piece of shit
01:38:53 okay here's a real
01:38:55 question that's important to everyone
01:38:57 okay at Eddie the Rack
01:38:59 why is Nate so amazing
01:39:01 yeah that's right
01:39:03 okay so he's asking for advice
01:39:05 why is Nate so good at picking questions
01:39:07 it's how to deal
01:39:09 with a family member who is a shitty
01:39:11 commenter what do you do
01:39:13 when you're faced with that ultimate dilemma
01:39:15 when you have to put them down like a dog
01:39:17 just block them and ban them from your life
01:39:19 you gotta put them down
01:39:21 ban them from your life
01:39:23 ban them from their life with a fucking 9mm
01:39:25 no no just channel ban them from your life
01:39:27 what does that mean
01:39:29 it means to act
01:39:31 it means to act aloof and just to not
01:39:33 acknowledge them even when they say hello
01:39:35 exactly right to you
01:39:37 well
01:39:39 I have the fortunate
01:39:41 ability or thing
01:39:43 of not having any shitty commenters
01:39:45 in my direct family
01:39:47 in my extended family they're abundant
01:39:49 however my direct uncle
01:39:51 is literally not a joke
01:39:53 like a memester on poll
01:39:55 and talks to me about Pepe
01:39:57 and how cool he is whenever we meet
01:39:59 that's not a fucking joke
01:40:01 that's awesome
01:40:03 how old is this guy
01:40:05 I'm just curious how old is this guy
01:40:07 40 is like 6
01:40:09 what the fuck
01:40:11 actually no he's 52 actually
01:40:13 I didn't know anybody over 40 knew what Pepe was
01:40:15 other than like an alt right
01:40:17 thing
01:40:19 Hillary's already put down the alt right
01:40:21 weren't you gonna come out against Pepe
01:40:23 that's what we need
01:40:25 she fucking did
01:40:27 the anti defamation league came out against Pepe
01:40:29 I want Hillary to say
01:40:31 Pepe has got to go
01:40:33 as an alt right
01:40:35 fucking avatar
01:40:37 well I don't think that was her specific
01:40:39 I read articles on
01:40:41 brightbart.com
01:40:43 okay I just feel like these two things
01:40:45 are connected to the anti defamation
01:40:47 and you know what they say about brightbart
01:40:49 he's pretty bright
01:40:51 and he's bright
01:40:53 okay Nate good job on that great question
01:40:55 what else do we got
01:40:57 okay here's one
01:40:59 where'd that go oh here we go
01:41:01 there's a munchie the people want to know
01:41:03 at Wyatt word weaver is asking
01:41:05 what are the rest
01:41:07 of the tism stones they need to know for the
01:41:09 procrastopedia page what are the tism stones
01:41:11 we need the names
01:41:13 last I checked all of them are there
01:41:15 what the fuck would this guy ask
01:41:17 this question why what are you doing
01:41:19 yeah yeah what what the fuck
01:41:21 you embarrassed me on my own fucking
01:41:23 he's just a fake fucking fan dude
01:41:25 what the fuck what he's doing what he's doing
01:41:27 is he's asking about like the rumored
01:41:29 like fools gold tism
01:41:31 circulating they don't actually have power
01:41:33 but they trick under tailors
01:41:35 all across the world into thinking that
01:41:37 they're pretty good
01:41:39 it's the feminism stone
01:41:41 it's probably extended canon and awful
01:41:43 not canon guys that's not canon
01:41:45 not fucking canon
01:41:47 the only tism stones are
01:41:49 fucking autism sexism racism
01:41:51 and the other ones that I forgot
01:41:53 well the autism
01:41:55 appears when you summon the other six
01:41:57 are together right there's seven total
01:41:59 there's seven total okay so if there's seven
01:42:01 on the page you're fucking done go pack it in
01:42:03 kill yourself um okay
01:42:05 can I ask a real question now or what
01:42:07 yeah go ahead okay at tales
01:42:09 of nerdy I want to know
01:42:11 do you ever worry that your controversial
01:42:13 language I think you know what I mean
01:42:15 wink wink could hinder your
01:42:17 YouTube or IRL
01:42:19 careers I don't know what the fuck this nigger's talking
01:42:21 about
01:42:23 hinder an IRL career
01:42:25 well you know both are possible
01:42:27 especially for me I've got a real job
01:42:29 and I do not know
01:42:31 how it would be taken
01:42:33 if these things were to be
01:42:35 shown to the people around the office
01:42:37 I don't know like I feel like I'm
01:42:39 pretty much not guilty of doing
01:42:41 anything wrong I feel like it's just a bunch of
01:42:43 fucking jokes that we're telling online and that would be
01:42:45 my defense it's comedy so relax
01:42:47 hopefully it wouldn't be that big a deal
01:42:49 you know what I've thought
01:42:51 about this like what would happen if
01:42:53 like someone like me you got like
01:42:55 two million subscribers and I'm one of
01:42:57 those big YouTubers but I still go
01:42:59 on this show and I say nigger
01:43:01 sometimes and it's like oh people can
01:43:03 look up the fact that I've said this thing
01:43:05 and then somebody might say you know
01:43:07 try to try to cause a big stink and say
01:43:09 this guy hypocrite said
01:43:11 this what a hypocrite
01:43:13 every single like
01:43:15 news thing would say that and that's
01:43:17 like funny but
01:43:19 epic joke epic joke I just I don't
01:43:21 worry about that at all because like those people
01:43:23 aren't my audience if you give a shit
01:43:25 about the thing is like fuck you the thing is
01:43:27 I think about that like yeah it doesn't
01:43:29 matter how big I'll get it won't
01:43:31 you know really affect me but it
01:43:33 I don't know well I mean
01:43:35 look at PewDiePie at such a huge
01:43:37 PewDiePie and JonTron are doing just fine so
01:43:39 I know he's doing fine but
01:43:41 there has been a massive like outcry
01:43:43 against the guy that was completely unjustified
01:43:45 and even if he's totally financially
01:43:47 secure the fact that there were so many
01:43:49 people online literally attacking them
01:43:51 and well you know cyberbullying the man
01:43:53 or whatever like that's that's not good
01:43:55 nobody wants that and they're like that's not cool
01:43:57 but yeah like
01:43:59 they're they're they're
01:44:01 retarded I mean in indirectly
01:44:03 like so much for the
01:44:05 PewDiePie
01:44:07 so much for the taller and left
01:44:09 there it is there it is
01:44:11 indirectly PewDiePie being like
01:44:13 labeled as a fascist Nazi
01:44:15 and being like the top youtube guy
01:44:17 has made a lot of like companies
01:44:19 pull their adsense revenue
01:44:21 from youtube they don't want to be associated with youtube anymore
01:44:23 and now youtube is losing money
01:44:25 and now monetization
01:44:27 across the board is just going down
01:44:29 so it's generally
01:44:31 like it's pretty gay
01:44:33 that's the dumbest shit I've ever heard
01:44:35 that companies
01:44:37 don't want to put their ads on youtube videos
01:44:39 because of offensive content
01:44:41 are they gonna fucking pull their ads off
01:44:43 of family guy and adult swim now
01:44:45 fucking idiots
01:44:47 well actually I mean companies do decide
01:44:49 what they want their commercials to air on
01:44:51 the conspiracy right now
01:44:53 is they're just trying to like turn youtube into tv
01:44:55 so they're trying to get rid of like
01:44:57 not offensive content but just like
01:44:59 anybody because like the whole thing
01:45:01 I don't know how much you buy into this but like I watch too much youtube
01:45:03 about dumb things where people are just saying
01:45:05 well the whole thing is it's a conspiracy
01:45:07 because they're mad at PewDiePie
01:45:09 and shit because they have more reach than like
01:45:11 all the mainstream like entertainment channels
01:45:13 like PewDiePie
01:45:15 legit gets more views
01:45:17 and like viewership and then like
01:45:19 HBO and like CNN
01:45:21 just regular tv so they're just like
01:45:23 because youtube just came out with youtube tv
01:45:25 I don't know if you heard about that but like they're gonna do a $35 a month
01:45:27 cable subscription
01:45:29 thing through youtube
01:45:31 so they're just like oh like the same
01:45:33 day they did that they started like trying to
01:45:35 shut down like all these platforms like this
01:45:37 and then like within a week like every single
01:45:39 like news
01:45:41 like article has come out saying like oh like
01:45:43 youtube is awful and authoritarian
01:45:45 and gross and we need to change it so it's just like
01:45:47 all this just kind of lining up
01:45:49 they're trying to like subtly influence it and change all this crap
01:45:51 yeah I think it's definitely happening
01:45:53 so the thing is
01:45:55 it's gonna happen regardless
01:45:57 the solace is like oh well
01:45:59 even if youtube doesn't pay us
01:46:01 we'll still have patreon but then
01:46:03 at what point will patreon be associated
01:46:05 they've taken out some fucking
01:46:07 yeah like patreon is like
01:46:09 oh we're now associated with people
01:46:11 who make like
01:46:13 like fascist content we gotta
01:46:15 we gotta stop letting them get money
01:46:17 and even if patreon allowed that shit
01:46:19 like the things like the giant outcry against
01:46:21 pewdiepie like if pewdiepie had a patreon
01:46:23 imagine the cut he would have suffered just from
01:46:25 people getting upset it would have been
01:46:27 something and you know he's running a business
01:46:29 so I he's probably got you know some
01:46:31 level he needs to keep me I mean maybe
01:46:33 pewdiepie is maybe not the best example but like someone who's more
01:46:35 riding the line like
01:46:37 like fucking dark side fill is like
01:46:39 I don't like the guy but like he's
01:46:41 he's on that line where he's barely
01:46:43 getting by financially if some
01:46:45 scandal were to emerge about like he said the word nigger
01:46:47 and you know like people got
01:46:49 really upset even though these things feel
01:46:51 extremely artificially inflated like if you made
01:46:53 a fucking joke you know whatever
01:46:55 people got mad at him for it like he'd be done
01:46:57 if his patreon shit got cut like his
01:46:59 career would be over he'd have to go work
01:47:01 at McDonald's if McDonald's would even hire him
01:47:03 knowing that this is a man who once said
01:47:05 nigger in his life can we even hire such a guy
01:47:07 let's just let him die in the streets like
01:47:09 here's what you're not considering Nate
01:47:11 is that people who donate to
01:47:13 patreons are typically people with
01:47:15 jobs and the type of
01:47:17 people who get offended by
01:47:19 mean jokes on the internet are
01:47:21 typically very liberal and those people
01:47:23 don't have jobs so I don't think
01:47:25 patreon is gonna be that big of an issue
01:47:27 nobody has a job
01:47:29 gets easily offended by things
01:47:31 let me ask you this
01:47:33 liberal jobless fuck
01:47:35 all I'm hearing is that very soon there's going to
01:47:37 be real competition for youtube
01:47:39 and real competition for patreon
01:47:41 some companies
01:47:43 are cutting out advertising
01:47:45 I guess I'll make a real
01:47:47 better website that supports free speech
01:47:49 that sounds pretty good
01:47:51 it's like a stupid piece of shit
01:47:53 it's funny we're talking about this because I was playing
01:47:55 I'm doing a whole podcast and did you about this next week
01:47:57 but the whole thing I think right now is
01:47:59 like we're kind of having a shift back
01:48:01 I think this whole model
01:48:03 that we've kind of been riding this high is kind of starting
01:48:05 to collapse where it's just like
01:48:07 everything has become so simple
01:48:09 it's just like oh I can just make a
01:48:11 free channel on youtube and reach
01:48:13 like millions and millions of people
01:48:15 and I'll get money and it's so easy for me
01:48:17 as a creator to just make a platform
01:48:19 and as a viewer I go to
01:48:21 like three websites and everything on the fucking
01:48:23 internet basically is right there
01:48:25 and I just think because it's becoming
01:48:27 so centralized and like big business
01:48:29 getting into it it's going to start becoming more
01:48:31 homogenized and clean like traditional media
01:48:33 and so everything that's kind of made
01:48:35 these platforms interesting is going to start to
01:48:37 kind of collapse under that like corporate
01:48:39 weight and then and
01:48:41 people are calling like oh we need an alternative
01:48:43 we're going to go to vid.me and like gab.ai
01:48:45 instead of twitter and and all that
01:48:47 shit but the problem is
01:48:49 like for
01:48:51 something like youtube to work
01:48:53 you have to be a corporation like youtube
01:48:55 just the amount of
01:48:57 money it would take to host all this videos on youtube
01:48:59 is fucking stupidly
01:49:01 like unimaginably large
01:49:03 so like it's not like you can say
01:49:05 they have server farms across the world
01:49:07 to support all this shit you know
01:49:09 and that's but that costs money and like
01:49:11 so you're like of course oh I want to go to
01:49:13 vid.me they can be the new youtube but
01:49:15 you're going to put them in exactly the same situation
01:49:17 youtube's in right now so they're going to need
01:49:19 money from advertisers so the advertisers are going to
01:49:21 come in and put down the same fucking
01:49:23 regulations so what the solution
01:49:25 I think is is that everyone
01:49:27 just need to stop being a little bitch and be like
01:49:29 fuck I'm going to have to make my own website
01:49:31 I'm going to have to try hard like fucking like
01:49:33 get an audience like the old fashioned
01:49:35 way because I have to have control over everything
01:49:37 if I want this freedom or have to
01:49:39 toe the line and just not be who
01:49:41 I actually want to be and make safe stuff
01:49:43 and people are going to have to make that choice
01:49:45 and hopefully our general internet
01:49:47 rights will remain where they are who knows
01:49:49 if that's going to last you know things are
01:49:51 ebbing away little by little
01:49:53 yeah I mean to me that
01:49:55 that is bad
01:49:57 I mean to me when people say people are coming
01:49:59 out and be like the internet's under attack
01:50:01 and like okay like yes you've lost
01:50:03 you know you've lost
01:50:05 privacy yes this is not actually an attack
01:50:07 specifically on your what you can do
01:50:09 online just you know got to be aware of
01:50:11 that shit I but I definitely feel like it
01:50:13 steps towards that kind of thing that I do
01:50:15 not want and here's another little
01:50:17 conspiratorial thing for the future so
01:50:19 like just like I was like we were saying before
01:50:21 like patreon you know would shut down
01:50:23 accounts of people who aren't acceptable youtube could kick people
01:50:25 and what happened but you were saying
01:50:27 that like but individual people
01:50:29 can still give money to patreons
01:50:31 and like because those people
01:50:33 are you know hard-working people who aren't offended
01:50:35 easily by shit they're not you know
01:50:37 libcucks it's not a problem but what
01:50:39 happens when the businesses that employ
01:50:41 those people are able to find out
01:50:43 what pay like which patreons
01:50:45 they their employees give money to
01:50:47 and then fire them because they're giving
01:50:49 money to the wrong people with wrong ideas
01:50:51 and wrong think I wonder when we're
01:50:53 going to get to that point hopefully never
01:50:55 just something I think about and
01:50:57 if we're going down the road we're going
01:50:59 it's only a matter of time like yep
01:51:01 that's the whole point like this authoritarian
01:51:03 kind of imagine getting fired
01:51:05 because you were like a patron of
01:51:07 John Tron who is now a quote unquote
01:51:09 racist and you know I
01:51:11 that's I don't even think that's a stretch
01:51:13 I think I think that's possible to happen
01:51:15 today it's possible
01:51:17 man it's possible
01:51:19 my controversial opinion is that everything
01:51:21 will be fine
01:51:23 I'm a worrier
01:51:25 so I like I think about these things
01:51:27 and I do not find it easy to sit back
01:51:29 and not worry about these things
01:51:31 now at the risk of sounding like
01:51:33 some weird retarded person
01:51:35 I do have a quick devil's
01:51:37 advocate question
01:51:39 you always sound like that monkey
01:51:41 everybody's concerned that
01:51:43 your ISPN is going to
01:51:45 sell your browser history
01:51:47 to companies
01:51:49 so that they can more directly advertise
01:51:51 to you and I get the privacy
01:51:53 angle of it but when it comes to
01:51:55 targeted advertisements
01:51:57 I don't see how that's a bad thing
01:51:59 because personally if all the advertisements
01:52:01 I saw were things that I actually
01:52:03 care about I think that would be
01:52:05 a better internet experience for me
01:52:07 than seeing fucking advertisements
01:52:09 for shit that I would never buy ever
01:52:11 well you know I'm with you on that
01:52:13 the thing with like
01:52:15 the way it works at the moment is that
01:52:17 it bases it off
01:52:19 of what you've looked at
01:52:21 and what you bought already
01:52:23 and then they try to sell you more of that
01:52:25 and it doesn't
01:52:27 sometimes just doesn't make any sense
01:52:29 like if you buy a DVD
01:52:31 of something
01:52:33 and then now Amazon is recommending you
01:52:35 the same DVD but
01:52:37 of a different type
01:52:39 I bought it already
01:52:41 there's no point
01:52:43 my biggest problem
01:52:45 I'm not a huge
01:52:47 I don't think people should be having
01:52:49 all this access to my personal
01:52:51 data I'm not a huge fan of that
01:52:53 but I'm not freaking out like a ton
01:52:55 of other people are because they're already doing it
01:52:57 and there's really no way to get around it
01:52:59 like if you're using your phone
01:53:01 your network provider has been mining
01:53:03 your phone for data for years
01:53:05 you're using Windows 10 it's mining all your data
01:53:07 you're using Chrome it's mining all your data
01:53:09 there's no way to get around that
01:53:11 I don't mind that so much as long as it's
01:53:13 anonymized and that it's used
01:53:15 for purposes that's useful
01:53:17 I know a lot of people are getting up
01:53:19 and arms over
01:53:21 if you use an Android phone Google now
01:53:23 Google monitors
01:53:25 everything you're doing on your phone but it serves you
01:53:27 stuff from the internet that's interesting
01:53:29 and it'll look through your email
01:53:31 I love Google now for when I go on flights
01:53:33 because it'll go into
01:53:35 my email it'll find the flights that I've done
01:53:37 and I'll have to pull up the itinerary
01:53:39 of me having to do shit
01:53:41 so when I go to the fucking
01:53:43 to pull my data
01:53:45 to have a tangible impact
01:53:47 on my life in a good way
01:53:49 as long as it's anonymized
01:53:51 and you're not trying to keep tabs on me
01:53:53 that's fine
01:53:55 what I kind of get pissed off about
01:53:57 is that these companies
01:53:59 like Verizon and AT&T and them
01:54:01 are investing
01:54:03 tons of money in lobbying
01:54:05 so they can get access to all this data
01:54:07 so all that tells me is that this data
01:54:09 is worth fucking
01:54:11 millions if not
01:54:13 billions of dollars
01:54:15 and what pisses me off is that
01:54:17 that means that everything I do
01:54:19 on the internet inherently has value
01:54:21 and I'm not seeing any of that
01:54:23 if you're going to make all of this money
01:54:25 that's taking all this time
01:54:27 and you're fighting tooth and nail for almost a decade now
01:54:29 to get this data it's insanely valuable
01:54:31 if you're going to get your way eventually
01:54:33 and make billions of dollars
01:54:35 I want a trickle down of that
01:54:37 I want my internet's cost
01:54:39 to fucking plummet
01:54:41 I don't want to pay as much as I'm doing
01:54:43 because if you're like literally tripling your income
01:54:45 off of just being an ISP
01:54:47 like fuck you you don't need to keep charging me
01:54:49 like $100 a month drop it down to like $50
01:54:51 companies tweaking legislation
01:54:53 purely for profit
01:54:55 circumvents the entire like
01:54:57 economic basis of capitalism
01:54:59 where you're supposed to give and then receive
01:55:01 like there's supposed to be a mutual gain
01:55:03 when through an exchange of goods
01:55:05 but just tweaking laws to better
01:55:07 advantage what you're trying to do
01:55:09 doesn't engage in that
01:55:11 and also rewards like
01:55:13 purely corporate profit driving
01:55:15 efforts and does not reward
01:55:17 like actual trying to improve
01:55:19 to give people something more of what they want
01:55:21 which is what it's all about
01:55:23 if it's not doing that it's not helping the system
01:55:25 you're just forming an oligarchy
01:55:27 essentially you're giving these corporations
01:55:29 like governmental authority
01:55:31 to bring this
01:55:33 sort of back to the whole parents thing
01:55:35 I think like I was saying
01:55:37 kids are gonna grow up
01:55:39 and they're gonna be like
01:55:41 in a world that I don't understand
01:55:43 but I'm gonna have to deal with it
01:55:45 it's probably gonna be like the death of privacy
01:55:47 like the next few generations
01:55:49 they're just gonna not know what it means
01:55:51 to have privacy
01:55:53 and I'm just gonna have to deal with the fact
01:55:55 that they're living in that world now
01:55:57 and even though I don't like it
01:55:59 that's just how it's gonna be
01:56:01 have you guys seen that black mirror episode
01:56:03 about the people on bicycles
01:56:05 who are forced to
01:56:07 they're forced to watch ads
01:56:09 and if you look away
01:56:11 you're like shocked
01:56:13 but they live in a society
01:56:15 where everyone rides bikes to generate energy
01:56:17 to fuel everything
01:56:19 and you earn a little currency
01:56:21 as you ride and you can buy
01:56:23 shit that's advertised to you all the time
01:56:25 I'm not gonna go into it
01:56:27 but it's a whole terrifying dystopia
01:56:29 of nightmare where no one is
01:56:31 you're never free
01:56:33 you're putting these little cubicles your whole life
01:56:35 you just treat it like a little automaton
01:56:37 which is kind of how I view people
01:56:39 but still
01:56:41 doesn't look very comfortable in the future
01:56:43 everyone's an automaton
01:56:45 Starfleet would never say that
01:56:47 that's being more treating people worse
01:56:49 than Starfleet does
01:56:51 which I fully admit to doing
01:56:53 we solved the future
01:56:55 we solved internet privacy
01:56:57 and capitalism
01:56:59 we fixed it all
01:57:01 we also talked about dads
01:57:03 if you care about any of this
01:57:05 it's your duty to become a politician
01:57:07 and change things
01:57:09 if you don't do that then you don't care enough
01:57:11 I agree
01:57:13 well, not everybody can be a politician
01:57:15 but whatever
01:57:17 people who want to be politicians
01:57:19 the people who want to be politicians
01:57:21 shouldn't be
01:57:23 except for Hillary
01:57:25 because it's her time
01:57:27 obviously
01:57:29 and with that
01:57:31 fucking goodbye
01:57:33 that was episode 51 of the
01:57:35 Procrastinator's podcast
