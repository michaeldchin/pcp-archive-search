00:00:00 Hello, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Poopcast.
00:00:29 I'm the best Poop ever. I'm joined by Mumkey Poop, Munchy wears tiny craps, Ghostbusters
00:00:56 2 is better than Ghostbusters 1, also I like Poop. So today, as you can tell, we're talking
00:01:11 about a very serious topic. One day we have to do the Poopcast, but for now, we need to
00:01:47 don't see the smoke when the person exhales. Now that's a ghost. Oh god, I love you Urban
00:01:55 Dictionary. What about Ghost Poop? Do they have Ghost Poop on there when you let out a
00:02:00 turd and then you look in the toilet and you can't see it? You can't see it. No, none
00:02:03 of this. Oh, but you know, Mumkey, you were right. Number two was Ghost to avoid someone
00:02:07 until they get the picture and stop contacting you. So that's basically what you were talking
00:02:10 about. We've all been there. Of course. So we're dealing mostly with number one here,
00:02:15 Ghost. I thought it would be dealing with number two. Plop. Where's Jesse when you need
00:02:21 him? Ghost, the Discarnate. Discarnate? I guess that's a word. Soul of a deceased human
00:02:27 being or animal. Or animal. We're dealing with animal ghosts. Still occupying the physical
00:02:32 realm. These spirits may or may not know that they are dead. They can also be called forth.
00:02:38 They can also be part of the definition. Oh my god. Oh wait, wait. Okay, number two. There's
00:02:44 like four definitions for this. Number two is residuals. Residuals is a ghost, I guess.
00:02:49 Okay. Number three, a demon, angel, saint, or Christ himself. Jesus is the most powerful
00:02:59 ghost, no demand. And number four, a poltergeist. Okay, there you go. We're like a polter cost.
00:03:05 Like a holocaust ghost, like a ghost of Auschwitz. Okay, cool. Wait, so who wins in a fight? Danny
00:03:10 Phantom or Jesus Christ? Are we going to record that right after this? I think we probably
00:03:27 should. I think while we're in the mood. Well, I'm down to clown for that. Okay, we're going
00:03:32 to go ghost. So, I mean, how should we just talk about that right away? Because actually,
00:03:38 we had planted a ghost episode before some recent events transpired, but there's sort
00:03:42 of a new context to discussing ghosts and going ghosts, you know, in today, the news.
00:03:48 So I don't know if you folks have subscribed to a little channel called Mumky Jones, but
00:03:52 I mean, I know it's not very popular. It's not very well liked, but it's not at all.
00:03:58 So there was a mass shooting recently by, what's the dude's name, Mr. Staircase? Yeah,
00:04:03 Randy Staircase. That's right. Randy Staircase, a silly boy, decided that he was going to...
00:04:09 Yep, that's what he is. He's a very silly boy. For some reason, I'm sorry, I miss gendering
00:04:14 him. He identifies as a woman. He identifies as a female ghost because he loves Ember from
00:04:19 Danny Phantom so much. So at some point with logic, I didn't quite follow. He then decided
00:04:24 it would be a good idea to shoot up the supermarket that he works at and he killed like three people
00:04:29 and then himself and he went ghost. He has gone ghost now. So I guess we should discuss
00:04:37 our plans to do so as well, you know, like when we'll be also going ghosts to join Ember's
00:04:42 sick band and remember the name. What do you think, Mumky? When's your plans for that?
00:04:48 Well, first of all, I don't think this should have been a surprise to anybody about his
00:04:52 mental state because he was a diehard brony. So we already knew he was mentally unstable
00:04:56 and a childish. But as far as me going ghost one day, oh buddy, unfortunately I don't plan
00:05:03 on taking other people out with me like Mr. Staircase did. I'll probably end up going
00:05:08 ghost in my bedroom closet with a noose. My question is, when we all go ghost, what ghost
00:05:15 activities are we all going to partake in together? Are we going to do a PCP ghost?
00:05:22 Like a ghost version of the PCP where we're all recording a podcast as ghosts?
00:05:27 Yeah, I think so. With ghost microphones and ghost wires.
00:05:31 To the ghost internet, which is like they're drawing a new book for ghosts.
00:05:34 Yeah, right. That makes a lot of sense. But Digi will be too much of a pussy to kill himself
00:05:38 now that he has all that money, so he'll have to join in via Ouija board.
00:05:43 That'll be a good way to bring in our patrons, our patron supporters who give us real money.
00:05:49 We communicate via Ouija board. We only need ghost money at that point.
00:05:54 As for what I'm going to do when I'm a ghost, two words buddy, global warming. I'm going to
00:06:00 think global warming is real and it happens swiftly. I'm going to put all my power into
00:06:05 warming up the atmosphere with my ghost body. How does being a ghost do that?
00:06:10 I'm just going to get up in there and I'm going to be all spiritual and shit and it's going to
00:06:14 just happen bro. If you're trying to turn up the heat, I've got the ghost for you.
00:06:30 Okay, we got the song out of the way. I just turned all our audience to ghost. That was painful.
00:06:40 I'm running out of steam on this Ember trick. So maybe we should actually go to our ghost
00:06:44 stories because we are going to, I think like the general through line here is we're going to talk
00:06:47 about our views on ghosts themselves and then yeah. This is one of our ghost stories and my
00:06:52 Ghostbusters 2 is the best movie ever made. So should we start with what we think about ghosts,
00:06:57 our beliefs in ghosts and all that shit. I'm just going to start off saying that ghosts are
00:07:02 literally not real and there is no, they are 100% do not exist. If you think so, you are a fool.
00:07:10 And any explanation for a quote unquote supernatural event that you think could be
00:07:15 attributed to the supernatural is a billion times more likely to be caused by some sort of
00:07:20 physical phenomenon that you just aren't aware of or don't understand. So are you really prepared
00:07:25 people to like invent a whole nether world as the explanation for why like your chair shook
00:07:30 once as opposed to, I don't know, fucking tectonic plateshifting dude. I don't fucking know.
00:07:35 Nate, are you talking about ghosts or about the Christianity religion?
00:07:40 Well, you know, they're related. They're kind of really souls. We just said Jesus was a ghost.
00:07:44 Jesus Christ is the most powerful ghost. Here's my case. Ghosts aren't real, but they should be.
00:07:51 And I'm willing to, I need to become a statesman. I need to study the art of statecraft so I can
00:07:58 get into president and I can use my executive power to make ghosts real. I'm 100% behind you on
00:08:03 this one, dude. Right. Every time that I remember that ghosts aren't real, I want to kill myself
00:08:08 so I can become the first ghost and start the first ghost nation because every every like
00:08:16 ghosts are the only thing that I think matter in real life because they're fake and fake things aka
00:08:21 are better than real things because they're fake and ghosts are fake. That's my logic. You know,
00:08:25 before we get to off track, I did want to ask. So like Randy Stairs, right? Was he, did he actually
00:08:31 like believe in ghosts? Was he like, did he think that Danny Phantom was real? Like, what was his
00:08:35 headspace at? So he legitimately thought that upon death, you would enter the ghost zone from
00:08:40 Danny Phantom where you could be and do whatever you want. I mean, that sounds really cool. And
00:08:45 that's pretty much Christianity there. That's what I want, bro. That's what I want. The great thing
00:08:48 about the, the great thing about the ghost zone is that unlike with Christianity, you can commit
00:08:53 suicide and still go there unlike in Christianity, which has that annoying clause of you have to keep
00:08:58 living and paying, you know, dividends to the church. Right. When I'm a ghost, all I want to do
00:09:02 is heat up the earth, cause global warming and you know, maybe fuck a few star systems while I'm
00:09:07 at it. Not anyone in it, but in the solar system. What's up hippo buddy? Hello. Oh, I hope you enjoy
00:09:14 Doctor Who, you fucking non-ghost. Yeah, piece of shit. You fucking physical form being. Yeah, we
00:09:19 started. Yeah, we fucking started. We started on time, goddamn you. Why weren't you? Yeah. I don't know.
00:09:25 Well, fuck you. If you're lucky that Major was having mic issues or you'd be, you'd be shit dead. Oh,
00:09:31 yeah. Ghost, you'd have gotten ghost right now. Oh, no. Would I kick Major off by coming in? Oh,
00:09:36 my God, you left so many messages. She had technical issues. Yeah, that was some of me
00:09:40 spamming that hypocrite. Yeah, we almost got Jeff in here. The ghost of the PCP.
00:09:48 Well, okay, what else we got? Gib, what do you think about ghosts? Tell me what you think about
00:09:55 ghosts. I think they're pretty cool, but they're, you know, they're not real and that's pretty,
00:10:03 that's basically a real, you agree that they should. Okay, okay. I believe in the dream bubbles. Yes.
00:10:09 What if a ghost fought a skeleton? Who's more powerful between you? A skeleton, of course. A
00:10:14 skeleton is a raggedy, dingley, dingley dangoy. He's got little rattly bones and he can play
00:10:20 xylophone and impress them into, into disaparating them. Like, you can't, you can't destroy a skeleton.
00:10:26 He just puts himself back together. A ghost you can put into a vacuum, it just, they're just,
00:10:31 there's just so much worse. Well, okay, I don't know about that because while skeletons do have
00:10:37 that raw physical manpower and then that raw horsepower and the unbridled consensual sexual
00:10:43 ability that skeletons possess, you know, at whim. Ghosts, they can cause global warming.
00:10:51 They can walk through walls, disappear and fly. They're much more unique than the other guys.
00:10:55 Yeah. And. Who's ever knew what he had to do to stop all the ghosts out of coming through?
00:10:59 He's here to fight for me. Not only that, but they cause slime, the most important thing a man
00:11:06 could ever drink. I'm so glad you brought up the ectoplasm thing because I really want to get deep
00:11:10 into ectoplasm. Yeah. Oh yeah. Basically, all I think about is ectoplasm. This is where my love
00:11:17 of slime comes from. Really? Is that the genesis of your slime love? Say that again?
00:11:22 Is that really the genesis of your slime love? This is deep lore. Yes, exactly. Exactly. One time,
00:11:28 you know, I thought about ghosts and I thought, oh man, I love slime. Just like that. Yeah, oh man.
00:11:36 Slime. Yeah, slime. Slime. I hate slime, dude. I don't like slip and slide and I don't like soap.
00:11:45 I don't claim myself. It's disgusting. Why would you even give a low-crash coffee? I want to try out
00:11:50 my whole skin. I want my skin and organs and blood to drain away so I can become a skeleton,
00:11:54 the driest, bestest friend you could ever be. Oh my god. A skeleton versus ghosts is like yin and
00:12:00 yang. It's like the ultimate slime versus the ultimate not slime. The ultimate drive. Drive versus
00:12:06 slime. Drive versus white. Can someone clarify for this for me? Okay, so do ghosts produce ectoplasm?
00:12:13 Like when they touch, then there's goop there. Or is like ectoplasm like what a ghost is? It's what
00:12:19 you make when you see a ghost. Okay, what it is is like ghosts are not of a material of this world.
00:12:28 So when they try and interact with like a physical object, like a wall or something,
00:12:32 then like they're like atoms fuck up the real world and not imaginary things. And they turn
00:12:38 into fucking slime, which you think can then turn into a delectable drink and then drink and then
00:12:42 turn into a super Saiyan yourself. So you're telling me, okay, so ectoplasm is kind of like a
00:12:47 waste byproduct of a ghost's existence in the physical plane. Is that correct? Exactly. Yeah.
00:12:52 Okay, awesome. Awesome. In Danny Phantom. Slimer is literally me. He's literally me. There's not a
00:12:59 single more character that is more like me than Slimer. When you look at Slimer, you just think,
00:13:03 yep, that's munchy. If you were to try and argue that Slimer is not me, I think you'd be way off
00:13:07 base and you'd probably be wrong on every level. I think Slimer should make a cameo in My Little
00:13:11 Pony. I'm just throwing that out there. Oh, remember that one time Curry made an appearance of My Little Pony?
00:13:16 He was a little pony, My Little Pony. That was a slime character in episode something or other
00:13:21 season six. Oh, Hugh Jelly. Hugh Jelly was a slime boy, right? Yeah, dude, Hugh Jelly.
00:13:25 There was a literal slime guy and he came to the party and he had a little bow tie.
00:13:30 I don't remember that. He was a friend of Discord. You're a little My Little Pony
00:13:34 faggot. You don't even know. Oh, no. Okay. So can we all agree that we don't believe
00:13:41 that ghosts are real? Yes. Are you on board with that? I'm 100% on board. But they're all great.
00:13:45 Okay, so has anybody interacted with people who legitimately think that
00:13:51 they do? And if so, what's the story? Because I have several people in my life.
00:13:55 I do as well. Go for it, Tom. Yeah, Tom. Yeah, you should talk.
00:14:02 I don't know. I mean, just like I come from like a spiritual household, like, you know,
00:14:08 people in my house, they believe in religion and all that stuff. And ghosts, I guess they're a part
00:14:14 of that. And it's interesting because like I talk with my dad a lot because we both work in that
00:14:19 abandoned building where like 100 people have died and there's like pseudo crazy shit that goes on
00:14:24 that place all the time. And like there I've had experiences that most people would attribute to
00:14:30 ghosts. But I know it's just like my primitive monkey brain having having a overreaction.
00:14:36 What's that supposed to mean? Well, I mean, I'm not taking it back. So you're just gonna have to deal
00:14:45 with it. I didn't fight alongside you in the great monkey war for this whole shit.
00:14:51 Well, yeah, I mean, so like, you know, my dad's kind of more of a spiritual guy. So he will say
00:14:56 like, oh, yeah, there's definitely like ghosts and stuff in there. It was like, and I'm just like,
00:15:01 no, I think it's probably just my my my brain freaking out on me. But I did have a weird
00:15:06 experience there a couple days ago. And I was I knew it was just like, yes, it's me just freaking
00:15:11 out. But it definitely felt like, you know, it's interesting how like the things line up. So
00:15:16 just like, oh, yeah, it feels like there's something going on, even though they're totally sure. So
00:15:21 he was really good at pattern recognition. It's our biggest flaw. Yep. Yep. Because it makes us
00:15:27 think things that aren't actually true. And then it becomes as big intercontinental religion. And
00:15:33 then people lose all their money. And it's bad. And that's how Jesus the ghost came to be.
00:15:38 Yeah, the losing of the money is bad. But it's it's the worst. Forget going. Well, I know, I know,
00:15:45 I don't know anybody who actually like believes believes in it. You know, as far as I know,
00:15:49 I feel like the people who say they think about ghosts, they just, you know, they're having fun
00:15:54 there and a bit of like, oh, I wonder what that could have been. Well, you know, you'd be wrong
00:15:57 because my dad thinks he's seen a ghost before. Okay, you know, right. I mean, I kind of I'll
00:16:03 talk about a story with my dad, too. That's not specifically about ghosts, but it's kind of relevant.
00:16:06 But like the thing about the thing about believing in things that you don't know are real, like I
00:16:12 don't really have a problem on its face with believing in ghosts if you just like want to.
00:16:16 But the thing is, like, what I think what you're actually doing when you like allow yourself to
00:16:20 believe that stuff is you're like, allowing yourself to be like intellectually lazy, and you're
00:16:24 just like assuming something that you don't know is true. And like, you're encouraging within yourself
00:16:29 a pattern of behavior to just like believe things without proper evidence for them. And like, that's
00:16:33 what I object to that kind of like intellectual laziness. I don't know if I go that far evidence.
00:16:39 They think that they've seen evidence. I think they're wrong. I think the thing about about ghosts
00:16:43 is I think people just like it's the same thing with like aliens and all that kind of paranormal
00:16:47 shit. I think it's just fun. Yeah, exactly. I think it's just fun to to. It's fun to believe in
00:16:53 God. Well, it is. It is fun for forever. I think it's just people looking for comfort and for
00:17:03 religion. It's definitely a come more of a comfort thing. But I think for like ghosts and like
00:17:05 Bigfoot and like all that kind of shit. I think it's just fun to think that there's more to the
00:17:10 world than what we figured out, you know, that have this a mystery left in our otherwise predictable
00:17:15 and mundane existence. You know, I'm totally cool with that. And I okay, go ahead. Go ahead. I just
00:17:19 want to say I love how fucking terrifying God is like he's the scariest fucking guy. I'm so scared
00:17:26 of the ultimate ghost sending me to fucking hell. It's it's real fun. Are you going to join us for
00:17:31 the bonus episode we're doing who wins Danny Phantom versus Jesus? Yeah, yeah. Okay, you can
00:17:38 decide that later. But you know, the thing you know, Christopher Hitchens always had a great
00:17:42 line I loved about God, which is just or not, you know, about like Christianity in general,
00:17:46 where it's like Christianity is like, oh, no, he might have been about Islam, but it's all kind
00:17:50 of the same thing. Any monotheistic religion, they're all like they are, it's like you and these
00:17:54 people who like are all about it and like are so happy that they have God watching over them,
00:17:57 and then judging them if they should go to heaven or hell. It's like wanting to live in a
00:18:02 celestial North Korea, where like all your your inner thoughts are judged at every moment. And if
00:18:07 you go against the great leader and what he has decided is correct. That's you like you're gonna
00:18:12 fucking go to hell and people who are like, yeah, God, he's got my back. That's you being like, yes,
00:18:16 treat me like a slave, treat me like an unthinking automaton. That's what I want. And I don't even
00:18:20 believe in free will, but these people claim to and so they're really going against their own
00:18:24 fucking message here. But forget that, Tom, please continue. Wait, wait, just to interject
00:18:28 here real quick, because I think it's really important. You know, I was a non-believer a
00:18:34 couple days ago, you know, I didn't believe in the holy book, the good book that is. And my name
00:18:40 wasn't in the book of life, but ever since I was called an abomination yesterday, and I was gifted
00:18:48 Titanic and The Peacemaker, my two favorite Marvel DC comic books, I hope get him meditation
00:18:54 soon. I'm just gonna read you a little bit of a quote from these heavenly books that
00:18:58 they restored my fate. Oh, shit. That old hand, she never leaves me alone. I hate her and her Jesus.
00:19:06 I wish she was dead, dead, dead. All right. Yeah, you could see more of that on the given,
00:19:15 given gaming stream of Minecraft featuring Munchie becoming a licensed guy ever. I'll end you,
00:19:21 but you came later. You came after the Jesus. I came to chill, Hillary. Okay, all right, let's get
00:19:26 back to God. Damn it. That's what I did. Watch those live streams sometime, monkey. You will
00:19:29 hear the most blue-pilled man in the world. Okay, go on. Go on, Tom, please. I don't even remember
00:19:35 what I was talking about. I was more just like, you talked about, I guess, any specific spooky
00:19:38 stories or paranormal event. Like you said that you had an event the other day, and I was curious
00:19:43 what the incident was. Yeah, okay. So what happened the other day, and it was easy for me to just
00:19:47 kind of like, yeah, this is just me being dumb, but still, at the same time, your primitive brain
00:19:52 definitely fucks with you, is that at my job, for people who don't know, I work as a quote-unquote
00:19:57 security guard overnight at this abandoned mill. It's like a couple hundred years old. It's been
00:20:01 hollowed out for like a hundred years. There's nothing in there. Do you live in a Scooby-Doo episode?
00:20:06 You know, if I lived in a Scooby-Doo episode, eventually I get to the point where I take the
00:20:09 mask off and realize my evil boss is behind everything, but I haven't gone to that point yet.
00:20:16 I perpetually trapped in the middle of a Scooby-Doo episode, which I'd argue is worse.
00:20:20 So, in between, like every two hours, I got to go do a round. So I go around the entire building
00:20:25 and like make sure nobody's breaking in, because the worst thing that happens in this building is
00:20:28 like, you know, skateboarders come in and try and break windows or whatever. But it's overnight,
00:20:33 so nobody comes in. So I just basically sit there, breathe asbestos, and long for death. So
00:20:37 I wish I was joking. So in between like the two rounds between like 11 and 1,
00:20:45 half of the lights on the second floor just all went out at the same time. So when I go up there
00:20:51 and like I'm trying to like go through the building and I get to the part, like usually when I go
00:20:55 through at this point and do my round, I just I'm not even paying attention just on my phone
00:20:58 doing whatever and just like walking through the motions. But like I get to the point where the
00:21:01 lights are off and like instantly the entire energy of the building like shifted. And I knew
00:21:05 it was just like my brain fucking up. But it felt like there was like some presence in there.
00:21:08 There was like a super loud bang next to me and I looked over and nothing's there. And I'm just
00:21:11 like, Oh, it's fucked up. So it was it was really fucking weird. And then like, there's the worst
00:21:16 room in the building, the whole building leaks, and it's perpetually just like wet and soaked and
00:21:21 there's like moss and shit growing in there. So there's just one room that's like it leaks so
00:21:26 bad, it's always flooded. And like, my body like refused to go in there, just because I was getting
00:21:30 like super bad vibes. And I'm usually not somebody who listens to vibes. And I'm just like, you know
00:21:33 what, even if there is like no ghost in there, whatever, it's pitch black, and there's holes
00:21:38 off throughout the floor. So I don't want to fall like two floors down. So I'm just not gonna fucking
00:21:41 go in there. So I didn't go in there. And it was fine. And and but yeah, it was like it was it felt
00:21:47 like just it was like my brain playing tricks. I mean, it literally felt like there was something
00:21:51 like evil in there just because like my brain was going haywire. And I told my dad about and he's
00:21:55 like, Yeah, I've definitely had experiences. There's definitely like, there's definitely like
00:21:58 spirits in there fucking the shit up because like over 100 people have died in that building,
00:22:02 apparently. So crazy. Tom, that is the source of global warming. You found the one room where
00:22:08 global warming is being impetuated. You have to go there. It is it is like a perpetual warming
00:22:13 ghost machine. It is a perpetual greenhouse in there with like the way it's always like hot and
00:22:17 gross and sticky. So maybe it is maybe that is the the the bed of global warming right there.
00:22:23 And we need to know I feel like it'd be relevant to read another definition relevant to that story
00:22:28 that I didn't read at the beginning. So let me just read you the definition for ghost anal real
00:22:32 quick. Okay, God ghost anal happens when you are fucked in the ass by a huge dick and it leaves
00:22:37 you feeling like you still have a huge dick in your ass, even though the guy left about an hour
00:22:41 ago. And let me read just the little example here. It still feels like I'm being fucked in the ass.
00:22:46 Woman B, do you have a good case of ghost anal woman a no I have a job beating in 30 and it
00:22:52 feels like my shit is going to fall out. There you go. That's we've all been there.
00:22:59 My life is another quote from Titanic. Oh, you can't do this to me. It's not fair.
00:23:06 Just what I had it made. I hate you for this. God.
00:23:10 Inside of you, it's a flash of the things you've changed, while the cues are real rain.
00:23:19 And bright green eyes. Okay, now glowing green eyes. Oh, fuck. Okay. You're not a real fan.
00:23:28 You don't get to join Ember's Ghost Squad with me. Oh, yeah, you'll be in there for sure.
00:23:33 Okay, let's go to our next champion. Unless you have more, Tom, do you have any more stories?
00:23:37 No, ghosts are gay. But they're cool. I don't know. I'm conflicted.
00:23:42 Oh, fair enough. Give give what's the spookiest ghost story you are?
00:23:49 Well, the thing about ghosts and stuff is that I'm skeptical and I know that there's,
00:23:55 there's, you know, logical explanations for things. So when I'm in and like out in the dark,
00:24:00 in a spooky area, and I and I hear something and it's for it spooks me and I'm like,
00:24:05 but I get all excited. I'm like, okay, let's think what, what could that have actually been?
00:24:10 And I go through in my head like, oh, yeah, science and reason and logic and, you know,
00:24:13 facts and shit. And I'm professor ladies like equations flying around your head.
00:24:18 And I deduce like what it probably could have been like, oh, there's probably an owl like falling
00:24:22 over, you know. A very loud thing and owl falling over.
00:24:29 Well, you know, it's like something, something strange that you can easily like wave away.
00:24:37 Maybe the owl got scared by a ghost and fell. Oh, yeah. That's right. Yeah. So, so I'm very
00:24:43 into like ghostly places, but I know it's not ghosts. I just like being a little frightened.
00:24:47 There was this one time when I was on a goonery, which is like a week camp out in a country place.
00:24:54 I go there and I, and you know, sometimes at night, well, I'll just say it's, it's a scout
00:25:00 group for like disabled kids and I help out and I'm a volunteer. But after lights go out,
00:25:04 after you put all the kids to bed, you can just walk around and it's usually on a school premises,
00:25:09 you know, we hire out of school ground and stuff. And there was this one time it was dark,
00:25:14 and I went into the school building and you're not really supposed to,
00:25:18 but the doors open. So I'm like, shit, let's go. And I brought my brother, we went in there with
00:25:21 a torch and there was, you know, it was the scariest thing I've ever seen, but it was so funny
00:25:27 because the next day I came in and I realized what it was. There was this giant, I guess it was
00:25:31 like a school mascot. It's a giant ceramic gorilla wearing a school uniform. And I just went on
00:25:39 there. The floors, the floors were creaky. They were like renovating parts of the building. So
00:25:43 there was like, like those buildings where like the floor was all ripped up and there was nothing
00:25:47 in it. And then there was just this in the foyer. There's a big old fucking gorilla.
00:25:52 Fucking spooky because I thought there was something there. And I love, I love thinking,
00:25:57 what the fuck could that be? I really got to go in there like when it's light. And yeah,
00:26:01 so I like spooky, spooky places. I like being spooked. And I like thinking about it, but I don't
00:26:07 really say I don't really mind like people being like believing in it. I just think they're
00:26:13 a bit stupid. Yeah, yeah. Here in America, the only time we get spooked by gorillas is when we
00:26:20 go visit Compton. Oh, no, guys, I don't know if anybody saw us on Twitter. I just the last week,
00:26:27 I went to the zoo. They had just the day before I went, they had reopened the gorilla exhibit where
00:26:31 that shit went down with Harambe, literally the place where it happened. I stood there. Oh my
00:26:35 God, you see the ghost of Harambe running around in the water. He was, he was like, I know who did
00:26:41 9 11. It was like, I know who did 9 11. It was and then he fades away and you're like, who, who
00:26:50 wasn't Harambe? No, I'll never know. Yeah, technically that gorilla got more votes in the
00:26:56 last election than Bernie Sanders did. Oh, it's so sad, but it's true. Is that really true? Is that
00:27:03 actually true? I mean, do you think Democrats wasted their vote in the election on Bernie?
00:27:09 He wasn't allowed. They killed it. You can write in any name you want. You can write in any name
00:27:13 you want in the election. It doesn't count, I don't think, if they're not registered, but you can still do that.
00:27:17 Well, yeah, I guess you wouldn't think to burn. Okay, well, in any case, there's only one thing
00:27:24 scary than a ghost and that's a black person, fat. Yeah, you can't even see them in the dark. What is
00:27:29 that? What's going on there? Oh my God, imagine if there are black ghosts, dude, like twice as
00:27:36 I'm gonna steal my ectoplasm. I've seen what you called ghost addicts. Ghost dad, ghost dad,
00:27:42 ghost dad, my favorite racist. He's gonna rape you. No, he's gonna quailude the shit out of everybody.
00:27:48 Okay, um, he's gonna have a hung jury. I want to talk about my experience with ghosts because,
00:27:54 unfortunately, they have alluded to me all my life except for when I was a baby. And as we all
00:27:58 know, babies and ghosts don't mix because ghosts are just too sexually aggressive and babies just
00:28:03 don't know how to contain their raw sexual ability. And they just lead the ghosts on to the point of
00:28:09 absurdity. So when I was a little kid, I was just, you know, I was just running around. And then I was
00:28:16 just, you know, just fucking around cartwheeling all over the place, which, you know, you do kicking
00:28:20 the shit out of plants. And then, yeah, and then I just started screaming at the top of my of my
00:28:28 fucking lungs, which, you know, I'm known to do, right? I started screaming bad man and pointing
00:28:34 at like nothing. And so my my fucking mom came out and she was like, Hey, how's how's it going? Why
00:28:41 you screaming? Shut the fuck up. Get my bell. And then and she was like, Oh, man, I felt weird that
00:28:47 day. I could almost see God himself staring down me and telling me to leave because I knew there
00:28:53 was a bad man there. And then and then later, after I was told the story, I was like, You're
00:28:57 fucking stupid. Kill yourself. You should make you should make a hit movie called The Bad Bad Man.
00:29:03 And that's about yeah, that's good. And ever since then, I've liked ghosts. And so I tried to go
00:29:09 like I live in San Diego, and there's like a really historical famous ghost site place holy
00:29:15 site called the Whaley house. And this was it's supposed to be mad mad spiritual bro. You're mad
00:29:21 consciousness up. If you know what I mean, lol. So I went there. And I was just like, Hey, if you're
00:29:25 a ghost, I'm gonna fucking kill you if you don't get out here right fucking now, bro. I'm gonna
00:29:31 post all your nudes on Snapchat if you don't get right now, bro. You know, bro. So no ghost came
00:29:39 not even not even like a ghost dog was there is a ghost dog there. There's a guy who like stole a
00:29:45 boat. He attempted to steal a boat, but he didn't like successfully steal the boat. And he was
00:29:49 captured and hung for almost stealing a boat. And now he just walks around fucking with people.
00:29:54 And I want I wanted to see him. I wanted to see fucking the dog almost the little little children.
00:30:01 So I so I could whisk them away with, you know, it would be really, really, you know, great aesthetically
00:30:06 to those children capture a ghost like an infinite slime source available at any time that would be
00:30:11 really convenient for you. I mean, that's a side project. That's a pet project I'm working on right
00:30:16 now, where I just have a bunch of souls, not only producing more and more heat to, you know,
00:30:21 admit the atmosphere, but producing slime for me to drink daily. Learn the mad truths.
00:30:27 As I say before, I'm reverse blind. And the way I can, I can, you know, keep up my all seeing
00:30:32 eye and all my, you know, hide and senses if I drink a ton of slime, which, you know, I need
00:30:37 ghosts for. So I go around all the time hunting ghosts, not too successful lately. I think the
00:30:41 ghosts of, you know, they've been on the down though. I wonder what's stopping them. It's probably
00:30:45 the global warming. That's, you know, you know, like, like global warming is caused by ghosts,
00:30:50 but also harmful to ghosts. It's like, it's a lot like poetry, you know? It rhymes.
00:30:55 Munchy, do you know what the two scariest ghosts of all time are? The ghosts of those two kids
00:31:01 that Gal Gadot fucking killed. Oh, no. Where did she do that? Where did she do that?
00:31:08 You'll have to tell me you're the expert in this field. My favorite ghost is both the ghosts of
00:31:13 the Twin Towers. Those guys. They still haunt that place. If you go there and you're like,
00:31:20 you know, you're like hovering on a jetpack. In the Freedom Tower? Yeah. Yeah. If you're hovering
00:31:24 near where they were, like 70% up at the top, you can feel the concrete. You can feel it.
00:31:33 I know every single time, you know, if I'm ever low on ghost power and I always, you know, if I
00:31:37 just want to get shooed, if I just want to take the easy way out, I'll just prance along the trail
00:31:41 of tears and I'll just get my butterfly net out and I'll just fucking swing it all up in the air.
00:31:46 And I'll get that mad slime, bro. I'll get that mad slime. It'll be really funny.
00:31:50 I want to say, like, I'm thinking of like the way people talk about like spirituality and being
00:31:55 connected to the dead and how you're so dumb. They're not real. They're not real. Dead people
00:32:00 are never, they didn't exist. They just, they didn't exist ever. And, you know, they're talking
00:32:05 about that. And I'm like, I completely get it. I just use different language. Like if somebody
00:32:11 says, Oh, there's a guy who died there. I don't feel nothing. I do feel like, Oh, there's a guy
00:32:16 died here. There's a guy died right at my feet. Like, like, like 10 hundred years ago. And I'm
00:32:21 like, Oh, and really what it is, is that I'm feeling, I'm feeling like empathy for a human being
00:32:27 or sympathy or whatever it is. And that's the feeling I get. And they're talking about that
00:32:31 feeling being something else coming at them. Like they can't produce some external spiritual energy
00:32:37 and not like an internal kind of psychological reaction. Yeah. That's funny. It's funny that
00:32:43 when you find out somebody died, you feel like empathy or sympathy because I just feel envy.
00:32:50 Of course. Of course. Lucky motherfucker. Gotta do what I've always wanted. Before, before
00:32:56 monkey goes into his ghost story, I just want to bring up real quick. What do you guys think about
00:33:00 about spirit mediums of people who talk to the dead? Because I'm the greatest con artist retarded
00:33:08 or both, you know, to their credit, I think some of them might just be delusional. They think they
00:33:14 have powers. They're they're they're con artists. There we go. Oh, that's a good one. That's a good
00:33:21 one pending. You know that you know that Long Island spirit medium lady. I hate her so much.
00:33:29 She's like, everyone just fucking eats her shit. They're like, oh, yeah, you're talking to my dead
00:33:35 grandma. Oh, I feel so good. I feel so like cathartic that I got to talk to her. She's dead
00:33:40 and she's dying in hell. Thank you for letting me know. Stop. Everybody stop. It's not it's not
00:33:46 real replaced with a sans who just says she she's burning in hell. Don't worry about it.
00:33:52 Sands will be straight with you on that. Okay, so okay, mediums are shit. They're all garbage.
00:33:56 Okay, all mediums and psychics are just con artists. It's true. Yeah. Yeah, I yeah, they are
00:34:02 con artists. They're con artists and stupid, but they're aesthetically really pleasing and and
00:34:07 like spooky and like I always want to get my I want to go and get my magic ball read and so I
00:34:13 it can just be like some things will happen in your future. I can feel it. It's shit.
00:34:19 You know, not just just things will occur. I guarantee it. Have any of you guys gone into one
00:34:25 of those because like your parents were there and just like hey, let's do it. This would be fun or
00:34:28 like a friend or something and you go in there like and you're like you are the the stereotypical
00:34:34 I don't believe in this ghost stuff the whole time. Yeah, yeah. I don't know. I don't think I've
00:34:38 actually done that, but I've certainly felt it. I certainly thought it while I was there. I hope
00:34:42 they picked up my I feel like I feel that in church and ironically do you stop to go to church
00:34:49 I used to until until I until I broke my conditioning. Yeah, I didn't let the Zionist
00:34:56 control my brain anymore. I went till I was like 16 or something. I got confirmed. So
00:35:01 isn't it crazy that people like like when you're a child, they try to like get you wedded to the
00:35:07 idea so that you can't leave. You know, it's like it's the whole thing with like a thing with
00:35:11 if you're a Muslim and you try to leave like, you know, it's not good. They downvoted on Reddit.
00:35:16 Yeah, they'll shave your beard. Yeah, really close. A very close shave like
00:35:22 Sweeney Todd. Yeah, okay, that's I love you ghost. Monkey, tell me your spook stories.
00:35:31 Well, first I wanted to say about these mediums and these psychics back when I was doing a video
00:35:35 over a documentary called My Monkey Baby, there's a scene where a psychic she's like an animal psychic
00:35:42 who can talk to the woman's monkey and tell her if the monkey ate her pills and all this
00:35:50 I remember watching this. Yeah, so I wanted to prank call one and all the places I called,
00:35:54 of course, like didn't answer, like they didn't put up with my bullshit. But I looked at the prices
00:35:59 and they charged these motherfuckers, these con artists were charging $25 for every 15 minutes
00:36:05 of advice. I thought you're gonna say hour and I was gonna be like, that's not that bad, but okay,
00:36:08 yeah, fuck that $100 an hour to talk to these con artists. If you're if you're gonna manipulating
00:36:15 people, that's the career field to jump into hell. I want to go do that shit. It's just such a
00:36:19 parasitic thing to take advantage of people's like gullibility. It's not I think it's just
00:36:25 natural selection at work, though. But the problem is like because of our goddamn welfare state,
00:36:30 the dumb people keep living and breeding and we're going to get overrun with shitty people who
00:36:35 believe in Jesus. Nate, isn't it your responsibility then to believe them out of their money so
00:36:42 they have no choice but to die in the streets after they floundered even their state given money?
00:36:46 Aren't you doing God's work? But they'll get on fucking welfare and they'll drain it from the top,
00:36:51 they'll drain it from the earners. Okay, I'm getting on a weird political rant. Let's not
00:36:56 get into that shit right now. What are you saying, Gib? What's up? I was saying, I feel like it takes
00:37:00 a certain special type of person who does kind of believe in it to calm these people because
00:37:06 I can't imagine somebody who does know that it's bullshit actually making any money doing it.
00:37:13 Not due to guilt. No, no, no, no. I feel like you have to kind of believe it too much because the
00:37:19 way it is is that these people, they keep it up like so much that it's hard to imagine that they
00:37:26 don't believe it. They indoctrinate themselves. It makes sense to kind of condition yourself to
00:37:34 unbreak the conditioning. You have to be a really good actor and if you're doing that.
00:37:39 But they know that there's not a ghost telling them things in their ear. They're just making
00:37:43 shit up. So how can they have that cognitive dissonance? They're making shit up but they believe
00:37:47 that the thoughts that they're making in their heads are things that are being planted by spirits.
00:37:52 I think there are definitely people who do that. Humans are really good at tricking themselves.
00:37:57 I was going to say, no, I think there's both. I think there's definitely people who think
00:38:01 that the random thoughts that come to them during those whatever encounters are actually
00:38:07 the dead. But I think there are other people who are acutely aware of like, I'm fucking this person
00:38:10 over for $25 every 15 minutes. I feel like the ratio is more in favor of people who believe that
00:38:16 it's working. Because to be successful in doing that, you have to be a really good actor.
00:38:25 And I don't know how many good actors there are doing that.
00:38:28 I'm inclined to believe, Gib. I agree. I think people are really good at doing that. But even
00:38:33 if they don't actually believe, there's also like, they could think that like, because I've heard
00:38:36 some people say that they are like entertainers. And so like, they're here to like-
00:38:41 That's the legal defense they have to do.
00:38:42 I fucking hate that so much. That fucking cowardly, just admit. Just say you're a goddamn actor and
00:38:49 it's all a lie. Don't be like, oh, I'm an entertainer. Like, it's up to people to believe what they want.
00:38:53 Like that dude who wears that weird giant like blonde wig, poofy hair thing, you know that guy
00:38:57 who was in that H3HC video. Oh, those fucking cowards, bunch of fucking cowards.
00:39:02 Yeah. There's a Dateline NBC special about this where they went undercover and like,
00:39:06 they paid this psychically thousands of dollars for crystals and magic rocks and all this bullshit.
00:39:12 I can't get it on that, bro. Yeah, you should. It's the perfect job for Munch.
00:39:17 And of course, like for, I mean, I'm just going on a thing, but like there's the James
00:39:21 Randy Foundation that for like decades was offering like a one million dollar prize.
00:39:26 If you can just prove any of this shit's real in any way and nobody ever fucking did,
00:39:31 nobody took the million dollars because they fucking lying. They're all fucking liars.
00:39:35 Of course. What can you do?
00:39:36 All right. Here's my dad's ghost story. Word.
00:39:41 So it's a tragic story because when my brother, or I guess when my dad was 15,
00:39:45 his brother was fucking shot to death on the street by some, yeah, it's pretty sad.
00:39:50 This gang banger piece of shit. And no, I'm not just telling the story of that movie again.
00:39:56 Oh, that's the first thing I thought you were going to do. I'm not telling Moonlight again.
00:39:59 This is real life events. Okay. All right. If you say so.
00:40:03 So it's a year later, my dad's 16 on the one year anniversary of his brother being shot to death.
00:40:08 He is driving to school with his friend and they look, there's a big semi truck like behind them.
00:40:13 They see in the rearview mirror and they swear to God to this day, my father still believes this,
00:40:18 that the guy driving the truck was his dead brother. So what do they do? They're driving to
00:40:23 school. They turn that fucking car around and they spend the next hour and a half following
00:40:28 that truck trying to catch up to it when they finally do they look in the window. No, it's just
00:40:33 some old guy. It's just some old man. Some of my dad now thinks that it was a ghost. His brother's
00:40:39 ghost was driving a semi truck and I'm like, okay, dad, I'm not gonna make fun of you to your face,
00:40:44 but that's retarded. That's a bit silly, but yeah, you know, that seems like the kind of stuff
00:40:49 people believe. Yeah, it's kind of cute. I mean, both him and his friend swear they saw the brother's
00:40:54 face and it was the one year anniversary. So can you even blame my dad for believing this shit?
00:40:58 It's like too much of a coincidence that they both saw it. My dad has a story where he, you know,
00:41:06 he backs it up by saying, yeah, it was him and his sister, they both saw the same thing and it was
00:41:11 like a spooky man or something. And but at the same time, he tells that story and then at the
00:41:20 end he says, but it was probably just, you know, a car passing by and the light shining through
00:41:24 the window somewhere and going down the hallway. So he knows that it's probably not real and it's
00:41:29 just something, but he still likes the freakiness of it. How two people saw exactly the same thing
00:41:35 and thought it was this exact same thing. And then they were like, ah, so yeah. Yeah, I mean,
00:41:40 that does make it weird. It makes it seem very convincing if two people come to the same conclusion
00:41:46 about something. There are, though, I mean, just, you know, again, to beat my own dick about this
00:41:50 stuff because I've done a lot of reading about it. Like there are tons of things that have happened
00:41:54 historically. Like there are phenomenon where I think in like there was a South American village
00:41:58 one time where like the entire village witnessed like something happened, like the sun, like they
00:42:04 saw the face of God like over the surface of the sun, like everyone in the village did this the
00:42:08 exact same time. But like there are there are many ways to explain it besides like God exists and
00:42:14 decided to look at this village from the sun one time. It could have been like a sunspot or
00:42:19 like some sort of visual phenomenon. It also could be like the power of, you know, if everybody says
00:42:25 they saw something and then you feel like, well, I saw it too. Yeah, they just want to be part of the
00:42:29 group. Yeah, see, there's just so many problems. You have to like isolate. If you want me to
00:42:34 believe any of this shit people, you got to make a fucking proof and there has never been any ever.
00:42:39 So good luck with that. But yeah, okay, cool.
00:42:43 One time I was possessed by the devil. How'd that go?
00:42:53 Besides like continuous one that continues to this day. Right now I'm just being possessed by a
00:42:59 lowly ghost, but I was once at Bealzebub's court himself. I was over to like like test out my
00:43:08 cousin's new house that they bought a while ago. It's like, you know, you know, bash some shit in,
00:43:13 you know, break some windows and get it home broken as in breaking the home. And I became
00:43:20 like incredibly ill for no reason. And they live in the high desert. So everything's like super dry
00:43:24 and in like hot all the time. So I got I got I got a mad fever, a delirious fever. And I
00:43:32 could barely see it was all like fuzzy, like even fuzzier than if you like took off your
00:43:36 glasses and then like poured Clorox in your face, which I do every single day to practice my religion.
00:43:43 But it was it was awful. I could barely hear anything. And I slipped in and out consciousness
00:43:48 a ton. And you just thought, well, you know, this is probably the devil. Like that, like, you know,
00:43:53 I have a fever. The devil probably gave me a fever. That's probably what is occurring right now.
00:43:59 So I might as well be possessed. I might as well go out and just allow myself to be possessed.
00:44:04 So I was just like, All right, prove to me, God, if you're real, make the devil be real, too,
00:44:11 please. And so I like to think about like the next like out like like day, like a day was just
00:44:18 about how like, okay, the devil is in my head now. And he wants me to fucking kill all my friends
00:44:23 and family. That's what he wants. And I couldn't move or anything. So all I could do is just like
00:44:29 watch Isle of Lucy and like think about how the devil is commanding me to like just like fucking
00:44:35 get a knife and kill everyone near me and what and then watch more Isle of Lucy and Fresh Prince
00:44:39 of Balair and like transformers. And it was the greatest experience of my life. And after my
00:44:45 fear went away and the devil's subsided, the devil now like lives inside my body, but he doesn't
00:44:50 have full control. Every once in a while, he'll come back into my headspace. He'll become he's
00:44:56 one of my most prominent headmates and every every every smile to his little friend. And it's
00:45:02 pretty great. And I would recommend to everyone, please let the devil into your heart. This is all
00:45:07 I have to say on the matter. All right, well, sick dog. Let me Okay, here, let me tell you my the
00:45:13 only story I have. It's not me against my dad. And it's about the Holy Ghost. It's not about
00:45:19 Yeah. So like, have you killed your dad yet? My Well, I mean, he didn't even put in those terms.
00:45:24 He like my dad is a religious guy, which I continue to find baffling because he's so
00:45:28 wanted. Don't I don't I don't understand how anyone intelligent believes. Okay, but but like
00:45:34 one day while I was grill them, I'm like, dad, you got to tell me like, I don't understand why you
00:45:37 believe in any of this shit. You got to tell me because I'm see I'm drawing a blank here, dad.
00:45:42 What's the deal? It's like, okay, Nate, I've had some experiences in my life that made me think
00:45:46 there's some spooky shit going on. And here's here's here's here's the one that that he chose.
00:45:51 This was his best example. Okay, so it was he's he's with like, I believe my mom and
00:45:57 her sisters like my aunt don't don't remember which one. And they were hanging out and they
00:46:00 were like in a city somewhere. I don't know which one. And like, oh, so they're just they're back
00:46:04 to cross the road, right? They're just standing there, ready to cross this fucking road. And like,
00:46:10 like, so my my mom and her sister like start to walk across because they don't see a fucking car
00:46:15 coming. And then like, according to my dad, he felt something he felt a presence, warning him
00:46:20 specifically warning him that like something bad's about to happen. Stop them, you know,
00:46:25 pull them back. And he listened to it. And he grabbed them and he pulled them back. And then
00:46:30 like a car came by like, oh, shit, they would have died or something. That's been a bit of an
00:46:35 intuition. That's I mean, that was of course, I didn't challenge him because I could tell he
00:46:40 was you know, he's deep into the shit, unfortunately. And there's no way I could convince him just by
00:46:44 arguing. But like, yeah, I mean, they obviously there are plenty of other things that could have
00:46:49 been going on in the man's brain. I just feel like like something like that you said you could have
00:46:54 thought to yourself. Yeah, I'm so cool. And I have spidey senses. That's why I saved their life.
00:47:00 No, it was some other guy. It was just some gods. He did it. I'm not actually cool. Why do you have
00:47:05 to do that? Why can't you be spider man? I don't think they're not spider man. I think the only
00:47:11 reason the emphasis I got from it was like that it was like a voice that he heard. Like that seemed
00:47:16 to be like the impression I got from how he told the story. And that's why he like attributed it to
00:47:20 like God. And I asked him, so like, why into Christianity? Like what's, and he's like, well,
00:47:25 I'm not really, I mean, who the fuck knows if that shit's real. But like, I did feel like it was
00:47:29 like a godly presence or something. So, so that's good. Because like, why would you ever believe
00:47:33 that like one specific religion is true if you don't have any actual evidence for it guys? So,
00:47:38 you just remember guys, you happen to be in the religion that your parents are, because it's a
00:47:42 fucking cultural thing. You just raised that way. It's not fucking real. Break the conditioning.
00:47:46 Okay. Break the conditioning. The whole like hearing voices in the head thing. I think a lot
00:47:52 of people who say they hear voices hear a voice, which is them with that, which is that in a monologue.
00:47:58 And the only reason they say the words out loud in their head is because they've read that people
00:48:06 hear voices and that's what they think God is. So they, when they, when they have an intuition
00:48:12 and they think, I should probably change this, they think to themselves, you should stop doing
00:48:16 that. I'm God. And they're like, Oh my God, God's speaking to me, but it's just them. But they just
00:48:21 put the voice in their head because they think that's what a voice, you know, that's what's
00:48:23 supposed to happen. I'm telling you, man, it's that it's that human, like we humans have an
00:48:27 incredible capacity for pattern recognition and like anthropomorphization. I love thinking about
00:48:35 it. I love thinking about why people do it. I love thinking about ghosts. I love thinking about
00:48:39 spooky shit. I love it all. It's so cool. I don't even hate it. I don't even think it's stupid.
00:48:43 It's great. Can the thumbnail for this, can the thumbnail for this episode be Danny Phantom
00:48:49 tipping his fedora? If such an image exists. No, hippos are going to draw it for us.
00:48:56 Yeah, I will draw it by copy pasting a fedora onto an image of Danny Phantom.
00:49:00 That sounds perfect. That sounds perfect. If we're talking about our parents now,
00:49:04 my mother is a goldmine of gullible actions and insanities. You convinced her to let you go to
00:49:13 fucking Brony Connellone when you were like 12. Absolutely delusional. You know, completely out
00:49:20 of her mind. I'm sure she's just putty in your hands. Oh, you know it, bro. I have those mad
00:49:28 manipulation skills, bro. I'm mad. Absolutely mad. I can imagine now. Mom, where are my tendies,
00:49:35 mom? Where's my slime? Where's my ecto coolers? Okay, go on. Go on. Where's my fucking juice?
00:49:44 My soup, my correspondence. Where's my crystals? I need them to do a baptism over the internet, mom.
00:49:56 I'm going to a J.O. sesh right now, mom. I need my crystals. Okay. Okay. Anyway, tell us the tale.
00:50:02 So we never, she's never been that religious. She grew up religious, but it's not that she
00:50:07 doesn't, you know, she isn't the religious herself. She's just too lazy to convince me to be one.
00:50:12 That's good. That's preferred. So we go to church a little bit, but you know, not too often,
00:50:17 mostly just for each certain, you know, big events. But anyway, she had a sort of like,
00:50:21 like second wave, you know, like second wind, like, oh, I'm going to, I'm going to be religious
00:50:26 again. It's going to be really, really going to be it like a couple of years ago. And instead of
00:50:31 just like getting back into like a church, she started researching online for like, what is Jesus
00:50:38 really? What is like real Jesus? Okay. All right. All right. She's breaking the conditioning a
00:50:42 little bit. Yeah. Oh, dude, the conditioning is fucking shattered by the point, by the end of the
00:50:48 story. That's not existent anyway. So she, so she finds out like all the, the, the mysticism,
00:50:54 the, the, the modern mysticism, you know, like you're, I'm talking, you know, you got your
00:50:59 cosmic beings of light powers. You got your, you know, church of euthanasia. You got your fucking,
00:51:05 you know, uh, what's that guy's name? Something, something Apple white. You got those kind of
00:51:09 people. You got that one, uh, uh, Colton, Colton Tokyo that tried to, you know, raise the sarin
00:51:14 gas on the bus. That kind of shit. You know, uh, like, like crystals and all that kind of stuff,
00:51:21 which is where like, I was, you know, I had known about that culture, but from my mom,
00:51:24 you know, starting to practice, I really got like a taste for it. And I realized it was my
00:51:28 favorite thing in the entire world. Oh, okay. Okay. And I, you know, I, I love crystals and I
00:51:33 love chakras. They're my favorite. Let me find spirit science. My greatest discovery of all time.
00:51:39 Yep. And the rest is history, but from her, uh, she created a sort of like monument to Jesus,
00:51:47 but not like, when you like, not like Jesus, Jesus, more like, like slime, like ghost Jesus,
00:51:54 like, like the soup, like super Jesus, basically. Right. And it was, it was basically just like a
00:52:00 bunch of J pegs of Jesus, like super cross posterized. So it's just like fucking undecipherable.
00:52:06 And a ton, like, like it was just like neon green, uh, cardboard, like slab, I guess,
00:52:13 with a ton of J pegs of Jesus, you know, pasted on. And just some like, um, if you believe hard
00:52:21 enough, Jesus is real. And, uh, and, and, and like fucking like in like Microsoft word, like,
00:52:27 like word art, like change it to like make it look cool. Your mother is a master of aesthetics,
00:52:33 dude. This sounds amazing. Okay. Okay. It's incredible. And just a, just a ton of crosses,
00:52:38 but like most of them are broken and they had, and she had to glue them back together.
00:52:41 And, uh, it's just, it's a bunch of like literal just rocks, but like somewhat,
00:52:47 somewhat sparkly if you put them in the right light. Uh, and yeah, just a ton of shit like that.
00:52:52 And she hung it like over her wall. Uh, and the way the house is positioned, she hung it like,
00:52:58 her door would always be open and like you could like see, trust me when you say, uh,
00:53:03 every time I go to the kitchen, I had to look at that fucking poster of Jesus. Okay. Uh, you know,
00:53:07 Jesus, just, just believe hard enough and Jesus is real. Jesus is magic. You are magic. And if,
00:53:14 and if you just fucking align your chakras and go vegan, then you'll be able to see the spirits.
00:53:18 You'll, you'll be able to see in 4D, bro. You'll be able to get all four dimensions. Yes. Yes.
00:53:24 And she was super into it. And she, and she kept, when, uh, when we visited Denver a while ago
00:53:30 to visit family, she was like, you know, this is pretty good, you know, being with family,
00:53:34 but, but I buy the seminar I need to go to and, you know, you just hang out, just hang out around
00:53:39 Denver while I go to this, this cool ass seminar where they, the Dalai Lama, you know, jacks off
00:53:45 all over me and I'm able to find, I'll be able to speak, I'll be able to speak to Nazis in their
00:53:51 sleep. I'll be able, I'll be able to find out where Hitler stashed his fucking ghoul and where,
00:53:56 and where, and where Hitler's like personal fitness trainer, like, like, like, got all the
00:54:01 crosses in the nation together and made like one supercross. And I'll be able, I'll be able to
00:54:05 know everything, bro. I'll be able to, I'll be able to personally fund global warming myself.
00:54:11 I'll be that ghost powerful. And, uh, she did it. And this continued for a while until I was just
00:54:17 like, uh, you know, you should probably, you know, that's not really a good idea. I don't think.
00:54:22 So she went to like a bunch of seminars or was just one? Yeah. Okay. No, a bunch. Like, yeah. Well,
00:54:28 by a bunch, I mean, like, one time my mom went to a Harry Potter seminar in Canada. That was pretty
00:54:32 cool. Yeah, by yourself, by yourself. I mean, I mean, I mean, that's going to give her mad
00:54:36 spirituality. No doubt, dog. Which isn't shit, bro. Yeah. Shit's crazy. But, uh, yeah, eventually
00:54:42 she kind of tapered off because, uh, she, she, she read something like one of like the leaders
00:54:47 she was like listening to about spirituality had like raped like 70 children. Yes. Yes. Yeah.
00:54:53 He's got to absorb that ectoplasm from him. He's got to do it, dude. Ghost should leave
00:54:57 it inside children's testicles. He just needs to get inside, bro. And, uh, okay. And, and she was
00:55:03 like, uh, well, you know, I guess it's still, it's still like real, but I, you know, I might get
00:55:10 focused on other stuff. Yeah. Anyway, great. Thank you, mother, for allowing me to understand
00:55:19 spirit science, the only thing that matters in the world, and align my chakras to such
00:55:25 decent that I have. But dude, if you think my Christ consciousness is like high, her talk was
00:55:30 or so fucking bliss that it was hard to even look at her. She was just like a glowing, a glowing
00:55:35 white fucking like spectacle to observe. Fuck, yes. To the level like eight, bro, like level eight.
00:55:40 Holy shit. All right. Well, you got to get her on one day to really weigh in on this shit. Yeah.
00:55:44 When, when we start our long awaited, uh, spirit science analysis series, uh, you know, we'll
00:55:48 get the expert in. Well, that's, that's dope. Um, yeah, it's great. Well, shit team. Uh, well,
00:55:55 can we come to any conclusions here? What, what have we learned here today? The parts of the
00:55:59 Caribbean, the first movie with a heart ghost is really good because they also skeletons, but
00:56:04 I was about to say, they're skeletons and ghosts. They're not even ghosts. They're not even dead
00:56:08 for real. They're all dead. They're just they're cursed. They're not even full skeletons. They're
00:56:14 barely even. We're all full skeletons on the inside. That's true. They're fake fans, if you will.
00:56:21 They're fake fans of being a ghost, not of like fans of the idea of being a ghost, but they are
00:56:26 fake fans of like being a ghost that they are a ghost. Right. Okay. Yeah. All right, boys. My
00:56:33 belief ghost of all time. Oh, Moaning Myrtle. Wait, did you say worst? Worst. Yeah. Moaning
00:56:41 Myrtle. Worst ghost of all time. She's pretty bad. I mean, I was never, I was never too oppressed by
00:56:47 Casper's. All right. You know, he was plucky. He was adventurous. Yeah. Friendly punk ass bitch.
00:56:52 He didn't tell me where all, he didn't tell me where all the gold was.
00:56:56 He wasn't a 40 year old woman pretending to be jailbait floating around a girl's locker room,
00:57:01 for sure. Well, that's why I like Moaning Myrtle. You know, I know, I gotta say, I've never been a
00:57:07 fan of nearly headless Nick. Like, okay, he's a nice guy, but like, I'm never going to get over
00:57:12 the fact that he got cucked out of the whole headless thing. He's just he'll never, he'll never
00:57:17 be a full headless boy. He will never achieve that. But yeah, I'll always make him the worst.
00:57:22 Because he sucks because he can't even do it right. He can't do anything right. Instead of
00:57:26 tipping his hat, he tips his whole fucking head. It's amazing. You could do that if you were headless
00:57:31 to him though. He's played by John Cleese, the famous John Cleese. Yeah, he was in Rat Race.
00:57:37 I love Rat Race. And nothing else. Rat Race is my favorite movie. Me too, dude. We should listen.
00:57:41 Give me your Rat Race episode. We absolutely have to. I love Rat Race. It was my favorite movie
00:57:45 growing up. Yeah, me too. Well, that's what we learned, guys. Rat Race is the greatest movie
00:57:50 ever made. It's the best movie. It's so good. I think my favorite ghost is myself in the future,
00:57:58 when I become a ghost, which will happen. Oh, wait, wait. I have the worst ghost. Arania
00:58:03 Circuit? What have you said? Oh, Arania Circuit? It might actually be Arania. Okay, whatever.
00:58:10 We know the one. Spider bitch number two, right? Yes. Yeah. I mean, she was hot. She was really
00:58:15 sexual and Jake should have fucked her. I don't know. There was something wrong with her. There's
00:58:19 something wrong. I don't know what it was. I mean, what was wrong about her was that she turned
00:58:22 into like this evil psycho for no reason. Yeah, but even before that, she was just sort of like,
00:58:27 I'm so smart. I'm so smart. All of the dancers are the worst character ever made. That's not true.
00:58:34 Every single one. Mina sucks. Wait, wait. Who's a good one? No, Mina's all right. No, Mina's the
00:58:40 literally the best character. You take that back, you piece of shit. She sucks. She sucks shit.
00:58:44 She is only number two to Roxy in terms of girls and homestuck. She's great. She's fantastic. I love
00:58:48 her. Dude, just because you're a race trader doesn't mean we're all race traders, Nate.
00:58:54 Look, just because Vriska couldn't hack it and got blown the fuck out by how badass Mina was,
00:58:58 and Vriska was like, no, why don't you love me? I'm just going to pretend I'm as cool as you,
00:59:02 Mina. God, that was so pathetic. Vriska trying to be cool like Mina all along. Fuck you, Vriska.
00:59:06 Do you remember when Andrew Hussey got literally cucked in Canon and he watched them have sex
00:59:11 and wasn't literally cucked? I do remember that in general. That was great. Upvote.
00:59:16 We should probably stop talking about stuff that Monkey and Tom have no idea what it is.
00:59:20 Yeah, you're right. Okay, let's go to our questions here. All right, it's time for questions.
00:59:24 Oh, wait, wait, wait. Before the questions, I got a bit. Go for it.
00:59:27 We did a very official Twitter poll who is the worst PCP member and we've got the full results.
00:59:36 How many votes? How many votes did we get? Man, I didn't even get to vote.
00:59:39 We got 850 votes total. Okay, pretty good. That's pretty good. Should I go in order from
00:59:44 most hated to least hated or least hated to most hate? I mean, let's go from least hated
00:59:48 and then go all the way up to our winner, the most hated member. Okay, so with 16 votes,
00:59:53 the least hated PCP member is Hippo. Hey, what do you know? Who are those 16 people?
01:00:00 I'll kill them. That's an easy amount of people to kill. 16, I can do that. Those are all my alt
01:00:07 accounts. I'll turn them into ghosts. Okay, keep going. Who's next? Next we have with 21 votes,
01:00:13 Mr. Best Guy Ever. Yeah, all right. Yeah, I'm actually shocked. I'm actually shocked by that
01:00:18 because I talk so much. You just think that's a lot of material for people to hate me with,
01:00:21 but hey, thanks guys. Appreciate it. Then we have Mage at 55 votes. I guess they don't like
01:00:27 women because there's nothing to hate about Mage. Those are the 55 misogynists in our audience.
01:00:31 Yeah, okay. Oh, there's a small number. I know, pretty good, pretty good. At 73 votes, we have
01:00:36 Mr. Tom Oliver. Yeah, I'm an easy hate. So you might have noticed, most of the least hated people
01:00:43 are on this podcast and I have a feeling the other two participants might be on the other end of the
01:00:49 list. Let's find out. All righty. I think this is, it's like sixth place, whatever. It's Digibro
01:00:57 at 73 votes. Digibro and Tom are tied at 73 votes. Oh, really? Oh, shit. What do you know?
01:01:01 Their destined bond continues to this day. It's true. All right, the fifth most hated member
01:01:08 is Endless Jess at 85. You know, Jess was leading that poll for a while, so all things
01:01:14 considered, I think he came out pretty, pretty well, pretty well. Good job, Jesse. We have
01:01:23 Davout at 92 votes. What can you hate about Davout? These are all, so far, those are all
01:01:29 people with less than 100. Now we go to the people with the big votes, baby. I'm ready,
01:01:34 I'm ready. Lay it on me. Tied for second place at 133 votes each is both Mr. Ben Saint and Mr.
01:01:43 Munchy. Our union continues to this day. Our spicy bro pack. I was really sad. I was really
01:01:52 sad Ben didn't win this one. I was really rooting for Ben. I voted for Ben on all my devices that
01:01:56 I could. I really did. I really did. And the undisputed most hated PCP member with 163 votes
01:02:06 is Munchy Jones. I did it. I won. I'm so proud of this accomplishment. Is he just gone?
01:02:18 You totally cut out there. Just repeat that whole thing. Well, they all heard it, but it's me,
01:02:23 Munchy Jones, I won. Yeah, Munchy Jones did it. Way to go. You are. What our audience didn't
01:02:30 realize with that poll is that you're not allowed to hate any of us, so you're all dead. We're
01:02:34 going to kill you all. You're all turning into ghosts. You're all banned. You're all going
01:02:37 ghost. We should have done the second poll so we'd have the other results. Maybe this week
01:02:43 we'll do the opposite poll and see how that goes. That's good. Wait, wait, wait. Before we go to
01:02:47 questions, Ghostbusters 2 is my favorite movie of all time besides the other ones that I like a lot.
01:02:53 For a lot of reasons. Number one, Slimers there. Number two, there's a sea of slime. There's like
01:02:58 a ton of slime. Number three, they use slime to control the Statue of Liberty, much like how I
01:03:03 use my influences with slime to destroy and dismantle local government and slowly take over
01:03:09 the country. And control women. Yeah, and control women and blacks and whites, especially white
01:03:14 people. And, you know, I just control everyone with my intense charisma, my intense slime based
01:03:21 charisma. Dude, dude, fucking the Power Rangers first movie has so much slime in it. It was the
01:03:26 big giant slime man. Dude, I would probably love that. I would probably love that. No, you should
01:03:29 definitely watch that. Slime controls people and it's great. It wasn't slime though, it was ooze.
01:03:35 Our close allies at the very least. Yeah. By the way guys, if you smash centipedes,
01:03:40 then you'll get like a couple EXP and you'll get mad slime. So fresh all the centipedes you can.
01:03:46 Reach into your spine and then tear out the centipedes. Control on your thoughts. Oh no.
01:03:51 Oh God, don't. Don't pull out that Toblerone folks. Leave it alone in there. And Ghostbusters 2
01:03:56 is also good because like a baby almost dies. Fantastic. Yes. All right, let's go to our questions.
01:04:02 All right, here we go everybody. Here's number one at Adamualpha asks thoughts on crystal Pepsi.
01:04:11 Did you try it? Did you like it? Are you a fan of the concept of clear cola in general? Love
01:04:16 how specific this one is. This is a great question. He's really obsessed with crystal Pepsi. He
01:04:21 loves this disgust. I love the idea of crystal Pepsi of cola that is clear. I think it's the
01:04:26 coolest thing in the world. Isn't that what's seven up in sprite art? Well, those aren't cola. Those
01:04:31 are like fruit drinks instead, you know. Oh, okay. I've never tried crystal Pepsi, but I would love
01:04:37 to. Does it have a different flavor or is it the same thing? It's got to taste different, right?
01:04:41 Have any of us actually tried this? Has anyone tried crystal Pepsi? I have not. None of us have.
01:04:46 Wait, wait. I haven't tried it, but I would say to this person who asked this question,
01:04:52 check out the Examined Life of Gaming YouTube channel. He makes reviews of sodas. He's called
01:04:58 the new do review. I think he tried crystal Pepsi in a recent video, like it was a new thing.
01:05:06 And he tried it and he reviewed it. He reviewed sodas and video games and you might like what he
01:05:12 has to say. Pretty great. Fantastic. He's got a place to go for his crystal Pepsi fandom.
01:05:17 All right. Well, I have never tried crystal Pepsi. I have about, you know, I would say about 48 bottles
01:05:23 here all blessed by a priest. So they're holy holy water. Is this what you use instead of actual
01:05:30 crystals? Because you can't afford them? Yeah. Yeah, I can't afford the actual crystals. They're
01:05:34 too hard to mine from Africa and I don't want to wind up dead in a ditch trying to get them. So I'm
01:05:38 as old, you know, there's a body tone of crystal Pepsi. I mean, it has crystal in the name. So,
01:05:41 you know, it's probably the same properties. Yeah. So I just pour that all over my body
01:05:47 when I'm trying to get an extra boost. It's good plan. Good plan. Yeah. Okay, here we go.
01:05:52 Questions from the world's greatest procrastinators fan artist, Ms. At Jane Moreau asks, do you guys
01:06:00 like camping? It's Jane Moreau, yeah. What did I say? Did I say J? You said Jane. I said
01:06:07 why would I say Jane? Oh, I fucked. Okay, I'm sorry, Jade. I love your work, Jade. At Jane Moreau
01:06:12 says, do you guys like camping slash hiking? Who's who's a camp guy? No, are we all city boys? We
01:06:18 all city slickers here. I have camped. I have camped a couple times. Quite a few times in a tent
01:06:24 and shit. And I do love, I do love a big old, if I see a hill and I got some shoes and they're not
01:06:31 wet shoes and they're like good walking shoes, I will climb all the way to the top of that hill
01:06:36 and then all the way back down and be like, oh, I don't know why I did that, but I like it. So I
01:06:41 love hiking. It's fun because I just, you know, it's good. So I guess I do like it. Yeah, I don't
01:06:47 mind going for a nice little nature hike or to go exploring, but there's no excuse to ever
01:06:54 sleep anywhere other than my comfy bed. Why would I want to sleep outside in the dirt?
01:06:59 It's pretty not good, but I appreciate the feeling of waking up in really early two to the
01:07:07 birdsong and the cold air and it's like, oh yeah, yeah, early man. I'm like coming out of my cave
01:07:13 and with my sticks and stones, I'm gonna build my life. Let me tell you guys, I was in the Boy Scouts
01:07:20 for a thousand years, Eagle Scout represent, and I did a thousand camping trips, did a thousand hikes,
01:07:26 mountain climbing, skiing, all that kind of shit. I love camping. I think camping is super
01:07:31 fucking fun. The only thing that's kind of a pain is you kind of got to like put time aside for it,
01:07:35 but I mean, I'll take any excuse I can get to get out of nature because I just don't
01:07:40 experience it whatsoever. I fucking love going camping and sleeping in there. I mean, I'm a guy
01:07:45 who can sleep anywhere pretty comfortably. So like the whole sleeping thing is never a problem for me.
01:07:49 I don't mind the kind of fucking bugs. I don't mind. I like sitting on my tent. I like cooking
01:07:53 outdoors on my grill. I fucking love everything about it. I haven't done all that sort of like
01:07:59 intense like doing everything yourself sort of thing because when I go camping, it's like with
01:08:04 a big camp troop. Like I said, that's the agunary thing I was talking about. They have a kitchen
01:08:09 tent and they make breakfast for everyone and you have patrol tents and stuff. When you just sit
01:08:14 down, you can just play with a Rubik's Cube while you wait for the next activity or something,
01:08:18 but like literally going on a quest into the wilderness and living off like a can of beans.
01:08:24 I'm not sure I could do that, but I do that without going into the woods. I'm the bean boy. Yeah. Okay.
01:08:32 Well, when I was a little kid for like school, you had to like go on a camping trip like that was
01:08:37 like there was like a camping trip a week that everyone went to a camp. And one of the many
01:08:43 misadventures I had, the most interesting one was I, there was like a sculpture class where you
01:08:48 got like a rock and you were supposed to mold it into something. I got a twig, I got some tape,
01:08:54 and I just made a hammer and I threatened to kill anyone who looked at me. Well, that's sick dog.
01:09:01 Let's go to Jade's other question here. Hair goals. She simply states hair goals. Question
01:09:08 mark in one word. Who's got hair goals? Gabe, do you have any hair? You're a hair guy. What are your
01:09:13 goals? I have hair on my head. I, my goals are to keep it long until it starts thinning too much
01:09:20 and then shaving it all off because I don't want to be like a bolding guy. I just want to go straight
01:09:24 from having long hair to being bold. I don't want to go through that. That's going to be a big change.
01:09:27 That's going to be a transformation. Yeah. And then when I'm like got no hair, I'm going to grow my
01:09:32 beard out. So I'm going to be like opposite. I'm going to have a big beard, big bushy beard.
01:09:36 And that's going to be like my hair just, you know, swelled round. That's what happened. It's
01:09:39 like, it's like a 3D model that just sort of glitched out the hair bit. When Gib gets older,
01:09:45 losing his hair, he like a 3D model. Okay, that's enough of that. Yeah, that's a good song.
01:09:52 He'll become Heisenberg. Yeah. Anyone else have hair goals? I got none. I'm just going to do
01:09:56 exactly what I'm doing. It's fine. I don't care. I want to get better facial hair. I've tried
01:10:01 product. It doesn't work. My face is perpetually broken and it really pisses me off every time I
01:10:06 see Gib's glorious beard. I just want to like cut it off and tape it on my face and pretend
01:10:11 that's the best I'll ever get. It sucks. I hate it. I totally forgot about that. But yeah,
01:10:16 I can't grow a decent beard. So one day when I'm an old ass man, I want a big Dumbledore beard.
01:10:20 That'd be sick. I want that now. If I could go full Gandalf now, I would like not even. I could
01:10:26 potentially get a Dumbledore beard. Oh my God. Hey, you. Yeah. One of those 16 people who voted
01:10:33 it was me. It was me. I voted because you had the beard.
01:10:37 And like if we get soup in it and twigs and it'd be horrible, horrible.
01:10:45 Fuck you. I want to look exactly like Steven Sugar besides the beard part.
01:10:51 Is that Rebecca Sugar's husband? Yeah. Brother, but close enough. Basically the same.
01:10:57 They had the same sort of leadership. Hey, I've got a question
01:11:01 from at Bottle Cape. And I really wish Jess was here because he has the best answer,
01:11:05 but we'll do it without him. What do you think of your audiences and what do you think of each
01:11:10 other's? Uh oh. Well, I think my audience, the give and take audiences like that, they're nice
01:11:19 people that, you know, I like them. They're good. They're nice and the hypocrite audiences like people
01:11:24 who they don't really know anything, but they're not dumb, but they're just sort of like oblivious
01:11:30 to the internet as a whole. And I'm like, well, you know, you stumbled upon this because you're,
01:11:36 you know, the YouTube algorithm gave you my video because you're English and you also clicked on it
01:11:43 because it's like something you know. So I got a lot of English fans who don't really know the
01:11:47 internet very well. But yeah, they're cool. You got a lot of, you got a lot of like Mary Poppins
01:11:53 who were like, oh, what's this computer box? I'll try to click on it and watch the game reviews.
01:11:58 Oh, these are some silly children. Yeah, exactly true. Yes. If you look at your demographics,
01:12:05 it's like male, female, and then Mary Poppins is a third part of that. Yeah, epic joke. Okay.
01:12:12 Let me see. Monkey, your audience is full of misogynistic, racist, bigoted pieces of shit.
01:12:17 They're the worst people because they follow their leader. They know what you want and they
01:12:22 follow suit you. You did this, you're bad. If anybody here has an audience full of leader
01:12:28 followers, it's literally everybody but me. You think so? I click on any of your guys' videos.
01:12:33 It's an 80% like ratio to the views. That's true. Every comment is, oh, man, I love you. I can't
01:12:38 wait to buy one of your fucking stupid mugs even though the month was over. Oh, you go to my channel.
01:12:43 It's like almost no likes. It's probably 20% likes for the views. And every fucking top comment is,
01:12:49 hey, monkey, fuck you. Hey, monkey, this video is fucking shit. Yeah, I know. I mean, I encourage it,
01:12:57 but I'm not going to say that they're following the leader as opposed to your fucking,
01:13:01 your drones and your audience is over there. Your audience is, they suck your dick way too hard.
01:13:07 I don't get it. The thing with my audience, it's developing a bit like Jesse's where like,
01:13:13 the only thing I do is shit on them and tell them that they're gay. But I also
01:13:17 give them like life advice. So they, it's like a, it's like a push pull going on there.
01:13:21 And I think it makes, it endears myself to them, you know? I think there's some of that going on,
01:13:26 which is good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I feel the same way about myself. Like when I see someone
01:13:44 who's got really great content, I'm like, yeah, I'm on board with this guy. I want to be like them.
01:13:48 Of course, I mostly overdoing that because I've been on YouTube for a while now. And
01:13:52 like that's that was with John Tron. And then, oh boy, then it turns out he's a goddamn bigot,
01:13:57 a goddamn racist. And no, I'll, all that matters is that his content's boring. That's the only
01:14:03 guy. Have you guys seen the rumors that he's working at Bed Bath and Beyond now?
01:14:08 That can't be true. What? He keeps posting pictures of products at Bed Bath and Beyond,
01:14:13 but he's behind the register. I'm going to go check this out. I don't believe that. He's got
01:14:18 three million subscribers for fuck's sake. All he has to do is just make good. That would be
01:14:23 unfortunate, but also rent is very expensive in New York. I was about to think like, oh,
01:14:29 that's funny. He's fallen on hard times. Wait, that's kind of sad. That is kind of sad. I don't
01:14:34 believe it. I don't, I do not believe it. How is he making money, Tom? He hasn't made a video in
01:14:41 three months. Okay, I was, I was actually looking this up the other day.
01:14:47 I heard he makes like, I heard he makes like $25,000 per video. That might be a totally made up
01:14:53 number, but like, he does a lot of like ad stuff and sponsorship, and he gets paid a substantial
01:14:58 amount per video that he does, as I understand it. I mean, that's made up number, so. I hate talking
01:15:02 about Jon Tron, fuck that guy, he's gay. Yeah, I mean, really, the only thing I care about is he
01:15:07 doesn't make good content anymore, so I don't care. So fuck that guy. My, my audience to go back to
01:15:12 that is like small and cult like and very devout and very like superstitious and easily manipulated
01:15:21 and just you're describing half of the PCP audience. I mean, there's a lot of overlap there,
01:15:26 you know, a lot of overlap. Yeah, when they say there's a new arm retrieval, they're like,
01:15:31 yes! Oh my fucking god. It's time. That's been like unironically like that. For a while now,
01:15:36 so I hope they're happy. I am unironically one of those types. For red matter media.
01:15:45 That's dude, I'm the biggest red matter media fan in the world. Yeah, it's pretty great. I love
01:15:52 them all. They're a little bit too meme-y for my taste, which may sound funny, but you know, I'm
01:15:57 not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm, I, contrary to popular belief, I'm not the biggest meme guy. I think,
01:16:03 I think they're fine, but I'm not, I'm not the biggest meme guy. Hillary, I love you.
01:16:11 Not Hillary. No. Uh, Momke, can you, I'm sorry, Munchy, can you just do me a favor? Can you give
01:16:16 us a quick average value? You know, don't acknowledge it. Uh, if you, what, what, what would you say is
01:16:21 the average Christ consciousness of your audience, you know, as, as a whole, what would you put that
01:16:26 pretty low, pretty low? No, they got some work to do. One or two. Okay. Okay. So maybe, you know,
01:16:33 like level one or two. Yeah. Uh, there's probably like a few fours in there. All right, you guys,
01:16:39 like, like a, you know, high five to a low six. Okay, good. All right, not bad. Well, cool. Um,
01:16:44 how about you, Tom? What do you think about your audience?
01:16:47 Mm hmm. Yeah, they got pretty mad at you. Hey,
01:16:54 hey.
01:17:14 Ah, yeah.
01:17:25 Mm hmm. That seems to be the way to go.
01:17:32 I'm, I'm just gonna be more potent, Tom. You're not potent.
01:17:35 You know, I've really been thinking about it and I've come to the conclusion that, um,
01:17:39 what's the benevolent fuck? What is it? It's like the benevolent dictator is really the best kind
01:17:45 of system of government you can hope for. And I've elected myself to this office. So I'm going to
01:17:49 use my, yeah, that's of course, of course. So I'm going to use my, my objectively best ideas
01:17:56 and create a cult like falling around myself and, and make and indoctrinate them with the best ideas.
01:18:02 They'll just be sheep, you know, they'll just be doing exactly what I tell them,
01:18:04 but little do they know I have their best interests in mind as well as the world.
01:18:08 And that's how it's going to go. And it's going to work out great.
01:18:11 I don't really want to get into a big thing, but every time I see like people saying you're like
01:18:17 literally like God and then like this into Jesse. Well, you know, like similar sort of things. I'm
01:18:23 like, why don't people do that to me? And then I see on my videos, they do kind of do that to me.
01:18:29 And I just realized that I look at other people's comments on their videos more than I look at my
01:18:34 own because I don't make any fucking videos. Yeah, you know, that's why I don't have like a fan base.
01:18:39 I have like a couple of people who are PCP fans on their occasion. They're like, Oh yeah, Gibb's cool.
01:18:44 Yeah, I like Gibb's stuff. And then, you know, they go back to not having watched any of my videos
01:18:49 because there are none. Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah.
01:19:01 Yeah. Yeah. It's it's kind of the kind of great kind of great people make PCP fan art, you know,
01:19:16 it's time. It's time to put the money where your dig is draw the shit. I think I think I think Tom needs
01:19:21 to Tom needs to be like in a in one of the many double podcasts that we have. We need we need a Tom
01:19:27 plus a one podcast. Me and Tom are going to do a depression suicide podcast. That's a good one.
01:19:33 That's a good one. Oh, by the way, before we get away from the topic, I just wanted to say that
01:19:37 about the whole like your audience really giving a shit, like I think that's a consequence of like
01:19:43 the audience reacts with strong emotions, too strong emotions like shown in the video. And I'm
01:19:48 a big like shouty boy and and like you're you're less of that. So like I'm a subtle boy. I love
01:19:54 your content, but I just think it's kind of like the nature of like people like, yeah,
01:19:57 oh, this guy's yelling, I want to yell my money right into his wallet. You know, that's that's
01:20:02 that's the way you can do like there's I it's working for me. Jesse was always like a big
01:20:10 passion guy and people got really passionate into his stuff. And like did did you was more of like
01:20:14 just like an absurdly prolific guy and people just like felt immersed in his content that like
01:20:19 achieves a similar sort of effect. And you know, if you could find you can do one of those and
01:20:24 I think it's a good way to go. And I and I'm sort of a chuckle boy, they come to me, they just
01:20:27 chuckle, they just type haha. And they leave. I think another thing more content. Another thing
01:20:35 to think about also is that like I'm a die hard red letter media fan, but I have never in my life
01:20:40 commented on one of their videos. So I mean, I think for every good commenter you get, there's
01:20:45 probably 20 people who love you just as much, if not more so, but they just they just don't
01:20:49 comment because they don't care about typing shit out. You know, I comment on like videos with
01:20:53 low numbers of comments, I guess, because I feel like I don't know that it matters more, I guess.
01:20:57 Like I've yeah, I also just I'm realizing I've never commented on one of their videos, even though
01:21:01 I consume everything they make because they're fucking love it so much. And yeah, that's interesting.
01:21:06 I have bought a bunch of their merch though, which I think is telling I was willing to spend money
01:21:10 on their shit. That's true. I think about that, like I wouldn't comment on one of their videos
01:21:16 because I don't expect them to read the comments at all. Yeah, yeah. So I don't think they would
01:21:21 ever get anything out of what I would put down. So I don't I mean, that's why I don't leave comments
01:21:24 in general. But when it's like, you know, one of you and I feel like, well, I could say this on
01:21:30 on discord or whatever, but it would make sense for it to be in public so people could see what
01:21:34 I'm saying as well. Yeah, I put a comment on there because I know that you would read it.
01:21:40 So I don't know. That makes sense.
01:21:46 Oh, yeah. Oh, that's nice. Comments are cool. The only comments I like are when Nate comments
01:21:51 on my Yu-Gi-Oh series. Otherwise, I don't give a shit. Monkey, you forgot you were distracted
01:21:57 from the tits. You have to go back. I commented like every day for like two weeks about that shit.
01:22:03 By the way, I want to real quick here encourage, you know, fan arts great. It's fine. It's I
01:22:09 like it a lot. But if you make songs or something, fan songs is greater than fan art objectively.
01:22:18 Most of the time. Most of the time. Sure. Sure. It's cool. I love that shit. I make them.
01:22:23 So yeah, fan songs are great. Any sort of fan project art is great. You don't have to just
01:22:28 be an art guy. If you anything you can offer is great. Anything that you can alter to the
01:22:33 alter of Munchie. You know those ring far like to worship me. I will appreciate those PCP
01:22:40 openings that those guys are making the anime openings for the PCP that were a big while back.
01:22:44 Those are great. Yeah. You know what? We don't have like a remix of our ending theme of the PCP.
01:22:50 Well, other than the ones you make, I'm supposed to be crapping my pants, you know, those.
01:22:59 Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's right. I forgot about that. Yeah. Somebody made like a I remember now
01:23:06 like an orchestrated version. It was great. It was good. It was good. It was uploaded by me on Reddit.
01:23:13 Well, I certainly would have if I had been aware of it. I don't know. We should check though.
01:23:21 That's true. Okay, let's go to let's go to some other questions here. Okay, here's one from
01:23:29 at strange CIG asks, why is Ben St. still alive? I don't know, dude. I've been worrying. I've been
01:23:35 wondering about that question for a long time. I've been worrying about that fact for a while.
01:23:39 Yeah. Wasn't that our $2,000 Patreon goal was kill Ben?
01:23:45 That's yeah, he's like a starfish. You break Ben in half, you just get two more Ben. So,
01:23:49 you know, I don't really know if we want to go down that road. He's trucking along,
01:23:54 bro. He's trucking along. He's trucking along. He's trucking. Oh my god. It'll be out by now,
01:23:59 but apparently the word on the street is a week ago when this comes out, the new fucking Nuzloc
01:24:04 ending to his genocide run is going to be out tomorrow for when we're recording this. I've
01:24:09 been waiting for it. I'm the biggest fan of that in the world. I can't fucking wait. Then he could
01:24:12 die. Then he could die. Imagine if that comes out and it's just like a HD remake of the first
01:24:19 Nuzloc you did. Like the back video. Gotcha. Yeah. That would be very interesting.
01:24:26 Well, I know that it's not because I'm a guest star on the episode. Oh man, I'm so excited.
01:24:32 Very hype. Ben and I had talked a bunch about it because I'd been like, oh, Ben,
01:24:35 I want you to do this. I want you to do this on the fucking thing. I've been being a creepy fan
01:24:40 of that Nuzloc. Okay. Okay. Here's the last question. We got one more from our good buddy,
01:24:46 the deadmine on Exilevich asks, oh shit, what are some of the worst jobs you've ever had? I know
01:24:53 some of Tom's. I don't want to Tom's. Yeah.
01:25:16 Yeah. Yeah.
01:25:36 Okay. Fair point.
01:25:37 Well, I am in between leaving school and going to uni. I had a year where I didn't know what
01:25:46 the fuck I was going to do. And I was just depressed. And I was forced to work volunteer work
01:25:54 to buy the government because that's how you get
01:25:59 because you're unemployed or whatever. And I had to sign an online form to like tell you people
01:26:07 sign up for this shit, idiot. I was a young boy. I still am really, but I typed in the wrong
01:26:17 county and well, not county, just sort of the wrong sort of area, the wrong town.
01:26:23 And they sent the forum online. Then they sent me because I typed the wrong town,
01:26:30 the commute was like a two hour bus drive all the way. Yeah, I told it before.
01:26:35 And working in that place, it was like a charity shop. And I had to like work in the back,
01:26:41 shoveling shit and deciding what the bags of trash that people send in, you got to
01:26:48 sift through it and find stuff and sort it out. And you know, that was boring. But that was at
01:26:54 least work. A lot of the time I was told to man the store, which meant just standing in the store,
01:27:01 there were no seats, there wasn't a seat behind the register. So I just had to just walk around and
01:27:08 sort of lie on the floor occasionally because my legs hurt. Yeah, I've been there. And I did that
01:27:12 for hours and I didn't like it and I didn't get paid and I ran away at one point. You don't get
01:27:18 paid for that at work? It was like the law was like, if you want job seekers allowance, if you
01:27:27 want grants for not having a job and you're looking for a job, you have to do a minimum of a
01:27:33 certain like, like three, four days of volunteer work a week. Yeah.
01:27:44 Yeah, yeah. So it was, it was, it was my first real experience of like a nine to five. And it was
01:28:06 so boring just standing in that shop because nobody really came in. And I didn't really sell
01:28:10 anything. I was just sort of waiting, you know, waiting to die. I was glad when I just didn't
01:28:16 come in and broke the rules. Way to go, dude. Excellent. My hardest job that I ever worked was
01:28:25 not going, was never not having, I'd never had a job before. That was the hardest job I've ever done.
01:28:31 A wee lad, a wee lad. When the hell put you to work, boy? I'll put that butt to work. Oh no, dad, don't
01:28:38 get out your belt. Munchies. Munchie, for you. Specifically, since you're a school man, did you,
01:28:45 did you ever have like a terrible homework that you just hated so much?
01:28:50 Literally every single homework. Homework is the work, I would rather go to school all day. Like,
01:28:57 like for like, for like 12 hour school days than do a single piece of homework.
01:29:02 Okay, just imagine being, yeah, the homework is fucking retarded. Yeah.
01:29:21 Yeah, yeah. I used to try, I used to try like when I first got into secondary school, I used to try
01:29:29 thinking, all right, I got to get on top of this homework. I hated homework all through primary
01:29:33 school. This time, I'm going to do the homework before I come, before I walk home, because I
01:29:37 walked home every day. And so, you know, the first few days I managed to do the stupid homework,
01:29:43 which is draw a page and do some words. And then I drew that and wrote some shit. And then I went
01:29:51 home and then, you know, obviously homework gets more and more and more and more. And I was like,
01:29:56 yeah. It just sort of became impossible to do it before I went home, because it would have been
01:30:03 like, oh yeah, just stay at school for two hours and have no friends. You know, I, yeah, I hear
01:30:10 you. I've had some shitty jobs myself over the years. I worked at Best Buy for a while. That
01:30:15 wasn't like that bad, but it was like retail and I hate, I fucking hate pushing things on people,
01:30:19 not downvoted. I worked at several pizza places. I worked at Papa Geno's, which is like a chain in
01:30:27 Massachusetts and like the Northeast region. Oh yeah. Nothing beats Papa Geno's besides an all-out
01:30:32 race war. I'm actually, I love Papa Geno's pizza. God, I would kill for some. It's so thin. It's
01:30:39 the thin. It's delicious. Okay. I know, I know. Gibbs is very concerned about that. I worked at
01:30:47 another pizza place that was like a mom and pop one that was, it was okay. It was kind of shitty.
01:30:52 I worked a bunch of like temp jobs, like after I, you know, the last like four years when I was
01:30:56 like doing stuff, when I was doing pony stuff, I worked at like, just like a temp agency being hired
01:31:01 for various jobs. It was never very good at them. Oh, it was all garbage. Did you demand they call
01:31:05 you keg? Of course. Okay. I'll just wrap up my point. I just wanted to say that like about my
01:31:12 current job. So my current job is not like the worst job in terms of like the hardest or I don't
01:31:19 know any of that shit, but like what makes it a unique challenge is like it's a real, it's a real
01:31:25 job. Like I'm a member of a team working on shit and like there are expectations of me. So like
01:31:30 when there's work to be done, it has to get done. Nothing else matters. Like there is no excuses to
01:31:36 like not do your shit. If you got to spend an entire weekend working on something to get it
01:31:40 fucking working for the Monday morning meeting, that's how you're spending your weekend now.
01:31:45 And that's exactly what I have to do this weekend and is what I will be doing as soon as we're done
01:31:48 fucking recordings. I have to fucking finish this program. It probably won't even be used in the end,
01:31:52 but I literally, that's what I'm getting. Yeah, that's like part of what I get paid for though,
01:31:59 that like I'm basically on call that I have to just do whatever. It doesn't happen most of the
01:32:04 time, but sometimes it does. And when it does, it's the worst and interferes with the things I
01:32:07 actually want to be doing with my life. But okay, whatever. That's enough of that.
01:32:09 Let me just quit your job and don't get on Patreon either. Just go away.
01:32:13 I'll just die. Yeah, patreon.com slash best guy ever. People set me free. Okay. Next is
01:32:20 what we say in time. What was your horrific nightmare job?
01:32:38 Hmm. Yeah, yeah.
01:32:44 That's cool. Yeah.
01:32:58 Oh, Lord.
01:32:59 Mm-hmm.
01:33:19 Cool.
01:33:30 Oh, at that point, tell them to fuck off. Yeah, that's too much. So how long did you do it for?
01:33:58 Just two weeks.
01:34:10 What the fuck?
01:34:14 These people didn't know what the fuck they're doing.
01:34:21 Yeah, that's uh, what the fuck? Okay. Well, cool. Dope.
01:34:27 Well, I didn't monkey have anything to say. No, he didn't.
01:34:32 The worst job I've ever had is, um, once every week or two, I get on this fucking podcast full
01:34:37 of these autistic little faggots. And I, I, I pretend to put up with their stupid bullshit
01:34:42 for like an hour and a half and then I get paid like what 20 bucks for it. Oh, whoop-de-dee,
01:34:46 what a great fucking gig. Kill me. 20 bucks for an hour ain't bad. Okay. Well, um, uh,
01:34:51 fuck, what was I gonna say? Something important. I don't fucking know, whatever I give up.
01:34:57 Subscribe to Monkey Jones. Yeah, that's, that's the thing to do. Do that. Uh, I guess we're done.
01:35:03 Subscribe to Monkey Jones. Hey, yeah. I just couldn't think of my own name. Shout out to,
01:35:11 shout out to everybody whose question I didn't read. Your questions were garbage. That's why
01:35:14 I didn't read them. So, uh, keep working, guys. Keep working on that shit. Shout out to ghosts.
01:35:20 Shout out to ghosts. Yeah. Yo, Danny Fenton, he was just 14 when his parents got a very strange
01:35:25 machine and it was assigned to you. You will remember my name. And don't forget to go on the
01:35:36 Patreon and join the exclusive Discord server. Tom didn't even know it was a thing, even though
01:35:41 he should have. That's the, well, we'll, we'll give you a link. Yeah, we'll give you one. Uh,

01:36:11 get ready. Also, go on Twitter and tell Patreon that their new logo is shit. It's really funny.
01:36:16 They love it when you do that. Yeah, that's a good idea. Have they said anything about it?
01:36:22 Are they freaking out? I hope they're crying. I hope they're upset.
01:36:29 Oh my God. Yeah. Dude, I want that fucking PR rep lady to like respond to those.
01:36:36 Fuck you. That goddamn idiot. She's so much shit. Well, I think, I think if they actually be all
01:36:41 cheeky and coy with it, I'd prefer that to them like being sincerely like that.
01:36:46 Like if they're being sarcastic, like, oh, I love a fucking logo, you prick. If they're like that,
01:36:52 then I'm like, okay, they have like a soul, but I still hate you. Yeah. Go back. We have to go
01:36:58 back. Taren. Hashtag. We have to go back to PCP. Oh, your logo is so good. I mean, pod. Yeah, whatever.
01:37:08 We're still going to use that goddamn thing. It's going to exist. I'm going to sell it,
01:37:13 whether I like it or not. No, we have not. It's not been done yet.
01:37:18 I know we're letting it slip away. We have to do it like immediately. So we need to
01:37:22 fucking do this shit. Okay. Things are happening, folks. We're going to get on this shit.
01:37:28 Hopefully we'll have some updates. Oh, wait, wait, someone else did a question.
01:37:31 Shit. No, just let it out. Okay. This was just relevant. This was just like somebody
01:37:35 added a question. I'm sorry. I can't find it, but they just asked like, Hey, what's the status with
01:37:39 the iTunes? I just want to let everybody know like the iTunes thing. Okay. So we've had a couple
01:37:43 issues. There's been some problems getting it set up. It's entirely on me. I just have had
01:37:47 and had the time because of me and Mavin shit to fix it. So iTunes is coming someday soon. So
01:37:53 just stick around. It'll happen at some point. There you go. Okay. That's the end. Thanks for
01:37:57 the list, everybody. What's up? No, no, no. We'll say goodbye, but I need to sync.
01:38:03 Oh, okay. Yeah. We'll sync before we add. Okay. Thanks for this, everybody. We'll see you next time.
01:38:06 Make sure you send more questions. Use the hashtag. Hashtag ask PCP. Bye.
