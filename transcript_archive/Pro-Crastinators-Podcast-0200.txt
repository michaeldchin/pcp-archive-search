00:00:00 This is a podcast called The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:02 A variety podcast running since 2015.
00:00:31 We're here. Oh, let me turn that down.
00:00:34 We did it. It's Radcon 4 Paradise.
00:00:37 We have a house that we're in right now, and we're all friends.
00:00:41 And here we are, just experiencing that in real time.
00:00:45 Who are we?
00:00:46 Where The Pro Crastinators Podcast, individually, we are Ben Saint.
00:00:51 Yeah, this mic position sucks.
00:00:54 Sure, screw it a little closer. It's very like you and Jess basically.
00:00:57 Jesse, Endless Jess, Munchy J. Trump, Best Guy Ever Meet, Gibbontake.
00:01:05 Hello.
00:01:06 Digibro.
00:01:07 I used my special move. Get high.
00:01:10 Tom Oliver.
00:01:12 I love video games.
00:01:15 And we're here just to talk about whatever we feel like at today's PCP episode that we're all part of.
00:01:21 Now, as a part of why we're here at this house, we had a Kickstarter link in the description
00:01:26 so you can just look at the Kickstarter, which we have already funded.
00:01:29 Yeah, right.
00:01:30 And as a part of that, there was a reward tier where you could suggest things and talk to us
00:01:36 and tell us what to do at Radcon.
00:01:38 Be quieter, is that what you mean?
00:01:39 No, he's saying to move the mic arm because it's completely in your face.
00:01:42 Oh.
00:01:43 So move it just down.
00:01:45 I can't.
00:01:46 Down like so.
00:01:47 What?
00:01:48 You will be audible if picking up everything.
00:01:50 It's fine.
00:01:51 Okay, okay.
00:01:52 Aim it upwards at the very least.
00:01:55 It's barely a mic up.
00:01:56 No more microphones.
00:01:58 It's fine.
00:01:59 No more talking.
00:02:00 Why don't you go on?
00:02:01 So, as a part of the PTA being a thing that can suggest things to us, we asked them questions for this.
00:02:10 One of the questions that they asked us was, did you, bro, you said that, do you know their name?
00:02:16 No.
00:02:17 Here, I'll get their name real quick.
00:02:19 But they were lovely and they asked us, what?
00:02:23 How do you feel about the Rad content that you've made so far?
00:02:27 Do you want to go over what we've made so far?
00:02:29 Oh my God.
00:02:30 Well, we got in and we started making like vlogs and dumb shitposts right away, which are all great.
00:02:36 That's pretty much what I come to Radcon to do.
00:02:39 Everybody else is always like, oh, I've got a plan and I'm like, I have no plan.
00:02:43 I have cameras and I have you people and I'm going to make you entertaining and put it on the internet.
00:02:49 It's paradoxical that the big things are kind of the least important long term, the least memorable.
00:02:54 To a degree.
00:02:55 The streams are always the best.
00:02:57 Like a really good stream where all of us are shouting and having fun is the best time.
00:03:02 I mean, I think that all the big videos are great too, but like they basically exist to give like form to the Kickstarter.
00:03:09 Yeah, yeah.
00:03:10 Whereas like the real purpose of Radcon inherently is to get all of us, you know, creative people in one place and make shit.
00:03:17 And so it's like, on the one hand, we always try to make it so like there's certain things that we guarantee because, you know, so that we can have like a justification for the Kickstarter goals.
00:03:27 But we try to leave as much time as possible unaccounted for just so it's like, you know, the magic can happen.
00:03:33 Got to have that serendipitous content.
00:03:35 Yeah.
00:03:36 What was that first one we did about something?
00:03:38 Okay, sorry.
00:03:39 Patches from Dark Souls.
00:03:40 Patches from Dark Souls.
00:03:41 Sucking my dick, sucking my cock.
00:03:42 Yeah, ain't nothing.
00:03:43 Touching my dick.
00:03:44 Touching my balls.
00:03:45 Touching my dick.
00:03:46 Touching my balls.
00:03:47 That's what it was.
00:03:48 Yeah.
00:03:49 Pooping on a cock.
00:03:50 Well, yeah.
00:03:51 Pooping on a cock.
00:03:52 These are just the things that I say in my everyday life.
00:03:54 So they're all jumbling in my head.
00:03:56 Okay, besides all the bullshit that like sucks, we have made like a billion and a half lectures.
00:04:03 We have.
00:04:04 This will be like.
00:04:05 We have three so far.
00:04:06 And we're not done yet.
00:04:07 We're doing two more today.
00:04:08 If you count the Brad Garling House lecture.
00:04:10 Brad stopped by and he did one real quick.
00:04:12 The Brad Garling House lecture was really fucking good and I cannot wait for that.
00:04:15 Is it?
00:04:16 Do we want to reveal all the ones that we have done?
00:04:19 No, I'm trying to figure out how many we've done.
00:04:21 I think it's five.
00:04:22 One, two, three, two, three.
00:04:27 Oh, good.
00:04:28 Three plus Brad Garling House.
00:04:29 There you go.
00:04:30 Yeah, that's what we've got.
00:04:31 We have two more.
00:04:32 And we've got two more on deck and possibly more as well.
00:04:37 Wait, no, no.
00:04:38 It was five.
00:04:39 I stayed up all night writing my fucking notes and now I'm depressed and I hate you.
00:04:44 Well, but the point is that this is going to have like an exponential growth of lectures
00:04:48 from last night.
00:04:49 Like double one point five or two point five times.
00:04:53 Something like that.
00:04:54 Sure.
00:04:55 Last time we had three, right?
00:04:56 I did one.
00:04:57 You did one.
00:04:58 You did one.
00:04:59 I did one.
00:05:00 I did one.
00:05:01 Final fantasy.
00:05:02 I did one.
00:05:03 He's a four.
00:05:04 Four.
00:05:05 No, you did one.
00:05:06 Yeah.
00:05:07 So we did five last time.
00:05:08 Okay, so we're going to have an exponential growth.
00:05:10 We're still going to have more than last time.
00:05:13 Five.
00:05:14 Yeah.
00:05:15 It's like picking up Munchy like twice as loud as everyone else.
00:05:21 Just the loudest name in the world.
00:05:23 Well, I did that and everyone yelled at me.
00:05:25 No, the problem was that it was blocking Munchy's face if we were trying to move the arm out
00:05:30 of his face.
00:05:31 That's all that matters.
00:05:33 Shanagins, everybody.
00:05:34 It's Radcon.
00:05:35 I love it.
00:05:36 Well, let's talk about, I mean, the little bit at least, we already did the big stuff,
00:05:39 the big ticket items as well.
00:05:41 The OVA and the music video.
00:05:44 Songs coming at you soon folks.
00:05:45 Those are intense.
00:05:46 Those are fucking intense recording days.
00:05:48 Yes, as they were.
00:05:49 Those are two days of nonstop recording.
00:05:51 Like consider that like when we do Radcon, we usually expect there to be like constant
00:05:55 live streams.
00:05:56 Just like, oh, well somebody will have a chance to live stream while we're doing something.
00:05:59 This was not the case for those two days.
00:06:02 It was just like ball busting.
00:06:04 We broke our bodies.
00:06:06 We were bedridden some of us.
00:06:07 Did he say that?
00:06:08 Just because you're old as fuck, you like jumped and you jumped like three times.
00:06:11 Tom was bedridden.
00:06:12 Ben was bedridden.
00:06:13 We all had to nap, man.
00:06:14 We don't have the energy.
00:06:15 I was just tired.
00:06:16 I was just tired.
00:06:17 I have sort of three problems.
00:06:19 Sleep.
00:06:20 Everybody else?
00:06:21 Yeah, you could have like sleep issues.
00:06:22 You're on your own.
00:06:23 Yeah.
00:06:24 You could have a lot of issues, Ben.
00:06:25 Yeah.
00:06:26 I'm just fat.
00:06:27 Cool.
00:06:28 Fuck off.
00:06:29 Ben's just stressing out about fucking delegates for Bernie.
00:06:32 Yeah.
00:06:33 Bernie sleep.
00:06:34 I also am convinced I'm going to die.
00:06:36 Oh, because the plane, the plane right home.
00:06:38 The plane and the coronavirus.
00:06:40 Wait, are you afraid of the plane crashing?
00:06:43 Yes.
00:06:44 Okay.
00:06:45 So they're separate.
00:06:46 Yeah.
00:06:47 Crash into the coronavirus.
00:06:48 Yeah.
00:06:49 You will live the virus though.
00:06:51 First of all, you won't even get it.
00:06:52 First of all, when you do get it eventually, then you will live.
00:06:56 That's true.
00:06:57 No.
00:06:58 There's only like a .2 percent chance that I die.
00:07:01 It's like 1 in 500.
00:07:02 I suppose.
00:07:03 That's pretty good odds for the coronavirus.
00:07:07 You don't want to risk that.
00:07:08 What if I gave you a gun and I said, hey, spin this revolver.
00:07:12 There's 500 holes in it and only one has a boat.
00:07:15 Pull the trigger.
00:07:16 Not everyone has a random chance.
00:07:18 If you're old and inferred, you have a much worse chance of dying from it.
00:07:21 No, that's including age.
00:07:22 I'm already more sick of hearing about this stupid virus than I am about.
00:07:26 Yeah.
00:07:27 Hearing about Greta Thunberg and Billie Eilish combined.
00:07:30 Well, what if you combined Greta Thunberg and Billie Eilish?
00:07:33 And gave them the coronavirus phase.
00:07:35 Thank God.
00:07:36 That would be so stupid.
00:07:37 Well, then they combined would be so young that it would be impossible to kill.
00:07:40 The nation would be mourning and I would be celebrating.
00:07:45 Anything of note that's happened that we should let people know while we've been here?
00:07:49 Apparently this stream going on has once again killed our previous streak.
00:07:54 Well, what can you do?
00:07:56 What in the fucking shit?
00:07:59 That was the best stream of all time.
00:08:01 That was the most base stream in history.
00:08:04 Wait, is it over?
00:08:05 What? No.
00:08:06 No, no, it's fine.
00:08:07 The stream we did all last night.
00:08:09 Every time we do a stream, the previous one gets the fucking...
00:08:12 That means if we stream again, we will kill PCP episode 200.
00:08:15 Potentially, but unless we download it first.
00:08:18 Wait, what are you talking about?
00:08:19 Did the last one get deleted?
00:08:20 Yes.
00:08:21 Why?
00:08:22 Someone said in the chat that when this stream went live, the last stream disappeared.
00:08:25 Just like what happened to us last night.
00:08:27 Well, there's nothing we can do about that right now.
00:08:29 Let's see if we can solve this problem again.
00:08:31 We were planning to...
00:08:32 If anybody still has it open, download it.
00:08:35 Yeah.
00:08:36 Fuck, I forgot the name of the guy.
00:08:38 One guy.
00:08:39 He managed to save the last one.
00:08:41 He saved everything we did in one guy.
00:08:44 So I really hope we can save that one too.
00:08:47 What the...
00:08:48 I'm gonna cry.
00:08:49 Why is YouTube the worst?
00:08:51 They've served their purpose in acquiring super chats.
00:08:54 Let them be lost in a seed of time.
00:08:56 Wow, I hate you.
00:08:58 You don't understand.
00:08:59 You don't understand the clutch Yoshi's Island moments that you missed last night.
00:09:03 I'm sure they were really great.
00:09:05 Hey, we're talking...
00:09:06 This is unspeakably retarded and we have to stop now.
00:09:09 Sure.
00:09:10 One thing, since it's big numbers episode, you know, 00, I'm gonna be a little bit reflective
00:09:16 and Mr. Kuhlman, or my Kuhlman, however you prefer to be pronounced against Iranian,
00:09:22 asked, what has changed in the last Radcon?
00:09:25 And I want to add onto that, where do you guys think you will be at in your develop psychologically
00:09:30 by next Radcon?
00:09:31 Where do you think you will be?
00:09:32 Where's the momentum of the group going?
00:09:34 Depends on how long we think it will be before the next Radcon.
00:09:36 That was also another question that someone also asked, how long do you think the gap will be?
00:09:39 I mean, it's too...
00:09:40 Probably...
00:09:41 Too numerous to know.
00:09:42 One year or less then.
00:09:43 Yeah.
00:09:44 For the next Radcon.
00:09:45 Because this...
00:09:46 We definitely waited too long to do this one.
00:09:49 We shouldn't wait two years.
00:09:50 No.
00:09:51 We shouldn't wait...
00:09:52 I was thinking like a year to a year and a half.
00:09:54 I mean, the funny thing about it...
00:09:56 Depends on what time of the year we want to do it.
00:09:58 When we first started doing these, the idea was that like we...
00:10:01 Because we had gone to BronyCon yearly on our own dime, we figured we had between us
00:10:07 the money to each travel like once a year to meet up.
00:10:10 Yeah.
00:10:11 And so the idea was like, we'll just go to my house.
00:10:13 But then we were like, we could do this more than once a year, so let's do a Kickstarter
00:10:17 and then we can do it every six months because we'll pay for it once and we'll Kickstarter
00:10:21 at the other time.
00:10:22 Then we all realized that like, oh, we should only do this if we're going to Kickstarter
00:10:26 because why would we spend all that money on flights when we could potentially fund it
00:10:31 this way?
00:10:32 But that also means doing it more rarely as it means organizing a Kickstarter every single
00:10:36 time.
00:10:37 Yeah.
00:10:38 So it kind of went from like being like, we'll use the Kickstarter to do it more often to
00:10:42 just we'll use the Kickstarter to do it at all.
00:10:44 Now it's a question of how often do we want to do a Kickstarter and have to gather up for
00:10:49 10 whole days?
00:10:50 Well, see, the thing is, is that there are like smaller meetups sometimes first throughout
00:10:55 the year.
00:10:56 So I remember specifically there was a big meeting meetup.
00:10:58 Yes.
00:10:59 To get a win.
00:11:00 October 3.33.
00:11:01 Yes.
00:11:02 October 3.33.
00:11:03 Because that was not October.
00:11:04 That was January.
00:11:05 Okay.
00:11:06 Last year.
00:11:07 Well, I mean, we are getting to the point where we are starting to like be next to another
00:11:14 kind of normally.
00:11:15 Me and Ben see each other like every fucking day.
00:11:18 It's a nightmare.
00:11:19 Tom lives nearby even though we never see him because he was crippled.
00:11:22 And then he won't come to furry conventions, even though we asked him to come to furry
00:11:25 conventions.
00:11:26 And he won't even respond.
00:11:27 It was in time to come to the furry convention.
00:11:29 What's fucking wrong, Tom?
00:11:30 What's up, dude?
00:11:31 Let's talk about this later.
00:11:32 Fuck you.
00:11:33 I'll kill you, Austin, right now.
00:11:35 Please do.
00:11:36 Nate, and did you're going to like gay marry or something?
00:11:39 I heard that in the grape farm.
00:11:41 It could happen.
00:11:42 That's the current plan to move to this very area.
00:11:45 That's been your plan for like four years.
00:11:47 Okay.
00:11:48 Well, here's the thing about me as opposed to everyone else.
00:11:50 I have plans and then eventually they all happen.
00:11:53 You know who else had plans?
00:11:54 Elizabeth Warren.
00:11:55 And look what happened to her.
00:11:56 Yeah.
00:11:57 She failed.
00:11:58 I succeed because I'm a man and a woman cannot make it in the presidency.
00:12:00 This is what I learned.
00:12:01 That's what Bernie said.
00:12:02 Even I voted for Jill Stein.
00:12:03 Hashtag Bernie was right.
00:12:04 I'll vote for Elizabeth Warren because I believe in the dream, but I know it can't happen.
00:12:09 That's my vote in my favor.
00:12:11 What were we talking about?
00:12:12 We were talking about where we're going to be by next red card.
00:12:15 Very likely I will live in this area.
00:12:17 And what has changed since the last red card?
00:12:19 I quit my job.
00:12:20 That's one big thing that happened to me.
00:12:21 That's a big thing.
00:12:22 I quit my job to become a YouTube's man.
00:12:23 It hasn't worked out for you.
00:12:24 And still going like this.
00:12:25 Yeah.
00:12:26 But I've got aspirations to make it go like this.
00:12:28 To at least reverse the damage.
00:12:30 If I could at least be neutral, that would be one thing.
00:12:33 I mean, you know, whatever.
00:12:35 The whole point of me just stopping to do a Viagra was like, well, this doesn't seem to
00:12:40 work in the way I hoped it would.
00:12:41 Time to try something else.
00:12:42 And I'm just going to do that as long as I can.
00:12:44 And then, you know, either it'll get better or not.
00:12:47 If I have to, as I always say, I'll get a fucking real job and just do YouTube on the
00:12:51 side the way I did for a very long time.
00:12:53 And I don't even think it'll be that much worse.
00:12:55 So frankly, I'm just very confident things will go just fine for me in life.
00:13:00 Do you foresee that it's going to happen?
00:13:03 Huh?
00:13:04 Do you foresee that it's going to happen?
00:13:05 Like, do you think that you will?
00:13:07 I don't know.
00:13:08 I mean, it seems like not a ton of people actually succeed in making YouTube their career long
00:13:14 term.
00:13:15 Really?
00:13:16 So I'm just open to that possibility.
00:13:17 I mean, I don't honestly really care either way.
00:13:19 I have a preference, but I'll just do whatever I got to do.
00:13:22 And I'm going to keep making YouTube videos no matter what.
00:13:24 So to the audience, it should make basically no difference other than perhaps the speed
00:13:27 at which they come out.
00:13:29 So yeah, I'm just going to be here doing my shit, trying to make things better and hopefully
00:13:34 making money enough to do it.
00:13:35 If not, I'll do other shit.
00:13:37 That's it.
00:13:38 That's it.
00:13:39 Low stakes here.
00:13:40 So, well God, how many years ago did I come through here?
00:13:43 Two years.
00:13:44 Just under two years.
00:13:45 Jesus.
00:13:46 Okay, so you quit your job.
00:13:47 Yep.
00:13:48 There was also me and Matthew with two.
00:13:49 Resounding failure.
00:13:50 Resounding failure.
00:13:51 Would you say that?
00:13:52 Well, I'm exaggerating a little bit, but kind of, yeah.
00:13:57 Okay.
00:13:58 You used to be here some time.
00:14:01 That was the one goal.
00:14:02 I mean, I talk about the shit a million times people know.
00:14:04 I just summarized it right there.
00:14:06 That's everything going on in my life.
00:14:08 Nothing else of interest.
00:14:10 Hippo, what's been going on?
00:14:12 You, like, died, I think.
00:14:14 Were you already dead by the time the Rack on 3 happened?
00:14:16 Were you already not doing epic, cool video game reviews?
00:14:19 And rick and mad-dosh?
00:14:21 No, I think I was still, yeah, that was 2018, right?
00:14:25 Early 2018.
00:14:26 Yep.
00:14:27 Yeah, by the October 2018, I decided no more Hippo Crit.
00:14:31 So, the things I recorded at Rack on 3.
00:14:35 GRPJ Kingdom Hearts 2.
00:14:37 GRPJ Kingdom Hearts 2 is not out.
00:14:40 I mean, we'll never be out unless I find the time and the inclination to just do it for no reason.
00:14:47 But yeah, like, I've switched gears from being a YouTube gamer review person because I realized,
00:14:57 I don't really, like, ultimately it's more of like a passing interest, I realize.
00:15:03 Just the fact that it is a career that people can have,
00:15:06 maybe think that I should pursue it as such,
00:15:09 but I didn't really feel that I was that into it.
00:15:12 So, I stopped, I went back to what I really liked,
00:15:17 which was at the time I was in the process of finishing Beljape.
00:15:21 So, I went hard on that.
00:15:23 Actually, I can't remember when I started Beljape.
00:15:26 I think it may have been around the same time,
00:15:28 or it could have been, like, happening throughout the whole year.
00:15:32 But it was not a serious thing when it first started.
00:15:34 Well, in the sense that it was not your fault.
00:15:36 No, no, it was just sort of like,
00:15:37 would it be fucking cool if I made something?
00:15:39 And then everyone responded no, and you kept adding it.
00:15:42 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:15:43 Just throwing balls around.
00:15:46 No ball games.
00:15:51 So then...
00:15:55 I did Beljape.
00:15:59 I think April, the following year, in 2019,
00:16:03 I finished it, April, May, whatever.
00:16:06 I tried to do a Kickstarter and that failed
00:16:08 for making a plushie of it,
00:16:09 but I was very much into doing this as a thing.
00:16:12 And so, I think, for the rest of 2019,
00:16:15 I didn't really do much, but I was planning
00:16:18 and crafting certain stories and stuff,
00:16:21 and doing, like, hundreds upon hundreds of Google Docs
00:16:25 with, like, world-building shit
00:16:27 that will eventually see the light of day
00:16:29 in certain, like, comic forms or whatever.
00:16:32 On the side of that, I have been, like,
00:16:34 continuing with my writing job freelance stuff
00:16:37 that I'm doing, which takes a long time
00:16:41 to get anything made.
00:16:43 I don't want to, I keep saying, like,
00:16:45 oh, we're just about to make it real,
00:16:48 but then it's sort of like, oh, there's a setback.
00:16:50 We have to do something else.
00:16:51 We have to change the script
00:16:52 or, like, get a different screen right over.
00:16:53 But there's significant progress coming there.
00:16:55 Significant progress,
00:16:56 but I don't want to jinx it again,
00:16:58 so I'm just going to not say what stage it's at at the moment.
00:17:00 I mean, the idea of, like, that even being your job
00:17:04 is, like, in a weird, mega-alternate dimension
00:17:06 where it kind of, like, is brought up,
00:17:08 where it's like, yeah, I had this job,
00:17:09 we're, like, doing a thing by,
00:17:11 and then it's kind of elaborate on that.
00:17:13 Once the first thing that I have my name on
00:17:15 as a writer of is a real thing,
00:17:17 then I can say, I'm a writer.
00:17:19 This is what I've made.
00:17:20 Until then, it's like, I'm dabbling in it
00:17:22 and dabbling in it and, you know,
00:17:25 if you could fall through,
00:17:27 it would kind of be difficult at this point.
00:17:29 But that's sort of the two things that are going on,
00:17:32 is, like, freelance writing work
00:17:34 and then my own personal comic hobby
00:17:37 in the beginning of 2020.
00:17:39 I started the Lord of Ghosts comic,
00:17:41 which initially started out as,
00:17:43 like, a very small idea, fan thing for Endless War,
00:17:48 your and Ben's thing.
00:17:50 We'll talk about that when it comes to that.
00:17:53 But, yeah, I'm just doing stuff.
00:17:56 Then Radcon 3 is, like, hell yeah.
00:17:58 I want to see my friends and be cool.
00:18:02 Cringe.
00:18:03 Yes, yes.
00:18:04 Big cringe, bro.
00:18:05 I can't count.
00:18:06 I don't know if this is the case,
00:18:08 but you have gone, like, completely different medium
00:18:11 of, like, artistic expression, basically.
00:18:13 Like, you went from, like, a video man
00:18:15 to a comic person.
00:18:17 I was always, like, an art boy at school.
00:18:19 Sure.
00:18:20 Videos, like, I got into making videos
00:18:24 through my little funny stuff
00:18:26 because I made a video on a whim
00:18:29 and I got great feedback.
00:18:31 I always thought of you as an art guy
00:18:33 because you drew your own stuff in the videos.
00:18:35 Like, you drew give and take.
00:18:37 So, like, from my perspective,
00:18:39 anybody who can draw at all
00:18:41 is automatically, like, an artist in my mind.
00:18:44 Like, I just compartmentalize you.
00:18:46 I mean, I don't think of video as non-artistic.
00:18:48 Well, I don't mean like that.
00:18:49 I mean, like, if you can draw,
00:18:51 then you have the ability to sell art in my mind.
00:18:54 Like, if you can draw with any competency,
00:18:56 then I'm like, oh, you can make money doing that,
00:18:58 and I can't.
00:18:59 So, you're an artist.
00:19:01 Yeah.
00:19:02 So, I got into video for basically just, like,
00:19:09 like, happy feelings.
00:19:10 Like, oh, I got loads of notifications,
00:19:12 like, some subscribers and people saying
00:19:14 I really like these videos.
00:19:15 So, that, like, propelled me forward.
00:19:17 But it took me a while to realize that
00:19:19 editing is boring, and I don't like it,
00:19:21 and I hate it, and it sucks,
00:19:23 especially when it's with video games,
00:19:25 because unlike, you know, a pony show or whatever,
00:19:29 you're, the footage you gather
00:19:32 is not, like, prepackaged as to what it is.
00:19:35 You have to film it yourself.
00:19:37 Yeah.
00:19:38 And you have to find, and the games are really long,
00:19:40 you have to find specific moments
00:19:41 if you want the footage to be correct
00:19:44 to what you're saying.
00:19:45 And it's hard being an analysis guy.
00:19:48 I like video games, but I don't really
00:19:50 care too much about analysis.
00:19:52 Like, I like hearing about it,
00:19:54 and I like thinking about it, but,
00:19:56 I don't know, it just wasn't really my thing.
00:19:59 So, you switch away from that.
00:20:01 Yeah.
00:20:02 Do you think that you will have another
00:20:03 major medium shift by Recon 5?
00:20:05 Where do you see yourself going?
00:20:07 I mean...
00:20:08 Will you finally kill yourself?
00:20:10 Don't take it away from you.
00:20:13 Everybody's got to get asked that question.
00:20:17 Yes.
00:20:18 Okay.
00:20:19 No, I think, I think in terms of, like,
00:20:23 medium shifts, I got into the drawing,
00:20:26 because, like, drawing and, like,
00:20:29 art and comics, and, like, it might not be
00:20:31 comics, but it will be, you know,
00:20:34 creating worlds.
00:20:36 It might, I might go harder into writing.
00:20:39 I might go, like...
00:20:41 Harder into boner?
00:20:43 Harder into boner.
00:20:44 Into, like, animation, like,
00:20:46 creating a world, creating characters,
00:20:48 doing cool, like, making of stuff.
00:20:51 Like, making a cartoon, like,
00:20:54 you know, stuff like that.
00:20:55 I don't, I don't imagine that I would, like,
00:20:57 switch and do something completely different
00:20:59 exclusively.
00:21:00 Like, I like, I have in, like,
00:21:03 aspirations to make, like, music,
00:21:05 and albums and stuff.
00:21:06 Yeah.
00:21:07 It can't be...
00:21:08 Sattled with one medium.
00:21:10 No, I like, I mean,
00:21:12 I don't know what I like, but I just
00:21:14 have a propensity to get into a lot of
00:21:16 things that I just, like, oh, I like that.
00:21:18 I want to do that.
00:21:19 I want to make gorillas.
00:21:21 I want to make, um, fucking,
00:21:23 uh, video games that I've seen already.
00:21:26 I just want to make homestuck.
00:21:27 I want to make things that I like and
00:21:29 just do it, but I did it.
00:21:31 Um, but I think, like,
00:21:33 the most, like, the thing I'm most
00:21:35 proficient in is drawing.
00:21:37 So I'll probably be doing something like that.
00:21:39 Yeah, forever.
00:21:40 Now, speaking as a fan of you,
00:21:42 I am very charmed by your audio, visual,
00:21:45 community, timing, and aesthetic.
00:21:47 And you obviously can draw.
00:21:49 And you have done animations before.
00:21:50 That, I mean, that's what you just school for.
00:21:52 Yeah.
00:21:53 So more hippo animations would be, like,
00:21:55 dude, that's the best of both worlds.
00:21:56 That's, like, not here.
00:21:58 I have been thinking of, like, doing,
00:22:00 like, with Red Man and Gun Girl,
00:22:02 just, like, really short, like,
00:22:04 webisodes, just, like,
00:22:07 you know, the Red Man comics,
00:22:09 where it's just Red Man saying some bullshit.
00:22:11 Um, I could easily make a really simple, like,
00:22:14 like, five minute, like, non,
00:22:17 like, YouTube algorithm,
00:22:19 or optimized, like, length of video.
00:22:21 Uh, just, like, old school animation,
00:22:23 like, five minute, two minute, cool thing
00:22:25 where Red Man says,
00:22:27 uh, I'm stupid.
00:22:29 Like, and skateboards off.
00:22:31 And everyone claps because they like it.
00:22:33 Yeah.
00:22:34 Like, that would be, like, a nice, like,
00:22:36 money sink that is just cool to do.
00:22:38 Yeah.
00:22:39 Sure.
00:22:40 Sure.
00:22:41 It wouldn't really propel me anywhere,
00:22:42 but it would be cool.
00:22:43 I like cool things.
00:22:44 Epic.
00:22:45 Um, die.
00:22:46 Did you, bro?
00:22:47 Who are you?
00:22:48 Yeah.
00:22:49 What?
00:22:50 Who am I?
00:22:51 Who are you?
00:22:52 Yeah.
00:22:53 Who are you?
00:22:54 Where were you last time?
00:22:55 I kind of know where you hooked me,
00:22:56 but I'm fine.
00:22:57 Wait, let me tell you.
00:22:59 Radcon 3 could be seen as the,
00:23:01 the beginning of my tailspin
00:23:03 as I dove into the ground and died.
00:23:06 I feel that.
00:23:07 So, you know, it was, it was,
00:23:10 it was Christmas of 2017.
00:23:13 I came to Boston to visit Munchie
00:23:16 and Nate and Tom and Ben.
00:23:19 Yeah.
00:23:20 Did you actually show up to that?
00:23:21 Yeah.
00:23:22 I don't think you...
00:23:23 Very good.
00:23:24 Live in Boston.
00:23:25 Were you there the same time that I was?
00:23:26 Everyone's there for Christmas.
00:23:27 Oh, yeah.
00:23:28 Everybody was there for Christmas.
00:23:29 It was a double date thing.
00:23:30 Yeah.
00:23:31 Double date times two plus one.
00:23:33 Yeah.
00:23:34 Before Radcon 3, right?
00:23:35 Yes.
00:23:36 So, we all met up in Boston
00:23:38 and Munchie was like hard-selling me
00:23:41 on how Boston's a cool place.
00:23:43 And Nate was like,
00:23:44 oh, I've always wanted to live in Boston.
00:23:46 And we were like,
00:23:47 all right, let's move to Boston.
00:23:49 We'll do PCP,
00:23:50 we'll do Radcon 3 in Boston
00:23:53 so that we can like house hunt
00:23:55 and scope for shit.
00:23:57 Now, at this time,
00:24:00 I was throwing around cliff
00:24:02 like a motherfucker,
00:24:04 spending a lot of money on weed,
00:24:06 spending a lot of money on paying people
00:24:08 to help me make my videos,
00:24:09 such as you or Tom or Jesse,
00:24:12 all of whom I hired to do like contract work
00:24:14 on videos.
00:24:15 I was like,
00:24:16 this is my way forward is I'm going to start
00:24:18 using the extra money I have
00:24:20 because I was living very low cost of living
00:24:22 at the time.
00:24:23 Like, you know,
00:24:25 weed aside,
00:24:26 I just had tons of extra money.
00:24:28 So I was like,
00:24:29 I'm going to pour this into having other people help me
00:24:31 and that'll be how I make my stuff better.
00:24:33 And I'm also going to work on only like big,
00:24:35 interesting projects.
00:24:37 Because I had made,
00:24:38 we have accepted mediocrity at the start of that year,
00:24:40 a video that was very popular,
00:24:42 that was just calling out YouTube.
00:24:44 Shout out to DeVoo.
00:24:45 Shout out to DeVoo,
00:24:46 who is the only reason that video is good
00:24:48 because it's just an unscripted rant.
00:24:50 You're really quiet in the mic.
00:24:52 I am?
00:24:53 Yeah.
00:24:54 Hello.
00:24:55 It all sounds fine.
00:24:56 Hello.
00:24:57 Is anyone there?
00:24:59 Don't trust with it.
00:25:00 Hello.
00:25:01 Okay.
00:25:02 Anyway,
00:25:03 so,
00:25:04 yeah,
00:25:05 I'm like trying to make bigger videos
00:25:07 more fucking real ass content.
00:25:09 And then it kind of began
00:25:11 when I started the,
00:25:13 when I did the Finish or Fail video
00:25:15 where I wrote the script really quickly
00:25:17 and I sent it to DeVoo
00:25:18 thinking it would take like a week.
00:25:20 And while he was doing it,
00:25:21 like, you know, while he's doing that,
00:25:22 I'm going to start work on my next big thing,
00:25:24 which is going to be how they marketed.
00:25:26 I remember at Radicon 3,
00:25:28 you hyping up how they marketed.
00:25:30 In fact, I was wearing all those munchy bumpers.
00:25:32 How they marketed were recorded.
00:25:34 Yes.
00:25:35 All of you were supposed to be involved
00:25:36 in how they marketed
00:25:37 because the plan,
00:25:38 the original plan for this series
00:25:41 was that it was supposed to be
00:25:43 exploring the marketing of different shows
00:25:45 and then using that marketing
00:25:47 to promote the videos themselves.
00:25:49 And so the main show I wanted to talk about
00:25:52 was Pop Team Epic,
00:25:53 which was developed basically
00:25:55 as a marketing gimmick.
00:25:56 Like, the point of the show
00:25:57 was to use this,
00:25:59 this like popular comic strip
00:26:01 as a vehicle
00:26:02 and like fill it with memes
00:26:03 and fill it with shit
00:26:04 that would get people to tweet about it
00:26:05 and just like promote itself.
00:26:07 But then the rest of the show
00:26:08 is all this like weird fucking animation
00:26:10 and like super outsider art.
00:26:12 And so I was like,
00:26:13 I want to do that.
00:26:14 I want to make a Pop Team Epic video,
00:26:16 but like the idea is that
00:26:19 it seems like a Pop Team Epic video,
00:26:21 but it keeps veering into
00:26:22 other people's content basically.
00:26:24 And so like there would be
00:26:25 just a munchy segment,
00:26:27 a Tom segment, you know,
00:26:28 and each one would be
00:26:29 in whatever your art style is
00:26:31 just brought into this video.
00:26:33 There'd be tons of memes,
00:26:34 tons of references.
00:26:35 Like I just wanted to imitate
00:26:36 the feel of the show in the video.
00:26:38 And so like that was going to be
00:26:41 a very expensive video to make
00:26:43 because I was going to hire everybody
00:26:45 to do their input.
00:26:46 And I'm like, this is my way forward.
00:26:48 Spend money to make money.
00:26:49 Spend money to make money.
00:26:50 That's what they say, right?
00:26:52 So that's the eight inch.
00:26:55 So, so...
00:26:57 It's adage, did you?
00:26:58 Adage.
00:26:59 You got yelled at in the two...
00:27:01 I don't care.
00:27:03 Anyway, so I'm working on
00:27:05 how they market it.
00:27:06 I'm conceptualizing it
00:27:08 while that video is in the editing bay.
00:27:10 Radcon 3 is coming up.
00:27:12 I'm so, I'm like all I'm focused on
00:27:14 is planning how they market it.
00:27:15 I don't work on the planning
00:27:16 for Radcon 3 at all.
00:27:18 And it was made clear
00:27:21 that I could not bring my girlfriend
00:27:23 to the Rad House.
00:27:24 So I was like, well,
00:27:26 I'm not going for seven days by myself.
00:27:29 Fuck that.
00:27:30 I have all this extra money.
00:27:32 I'll just buy a fucking hotel room
00:27:34 and you can stay in this hotel room
00:27:36 for this whole time.
00:27:37 It's funny to think back,
00:27:38 there was a man long ago
00:27:39 who once asked to bring his girlfriend
00:27:41 to Radcon.
00:27:42 We had a similar policy for that.
00:27:43 So it really just seems consistent.
00:27:45 Oh, you mean Jeff?
00:27:46 Yeah.
00:27:47 Well, I mean...
00:27:49 In Jeff's case...
00:27:50 Damn.
00:27:51 Destroyed.
00:27:52 In Jeff's case...
00:27:53 Obliterated.
00:27:54 It was that he was already there
00:27:56 and asking if he could bring his girlfriend.
00:27:58 Right?
00:27:59 Wasn't he...
00:28:00 Wasn't it like, like a week before
00:28:02 I am really...
00:28:03 I don't think he was like expected to be there
00:28:04 and he just decided he wanted to come
00:28:06 or something like that.
00:28:07 Something along those lines.
00:28:08 It was especially weird
00:28:09 because it was just like my house
00:28:11 and I was like, oh, I don't know
00:28:12 your girlfriend.
00:28:13 Like, I kind of know you.
00:28:15 I kind of trust you.
00:28:16 Yeah.
00:28:17 I don't know your girlfriend.
00:28:18 You just started dating.
00:28:19 Well, regardless.
00:28:21 So Radcon 3, you know,
00:28:23 I got a hotel.
00:28:25 We did that.
00:28:26 Radcon 3 was great.
00:28:28 Lots of good stuff came out of it.
00:28:30 But most of the main content
00:28:32 was stuff that was going to take a long time to edit.
00:28:34 And again, just like this time,
00:28:36 I mostly came and did like tons of behind-the-scenes stuff,
00:28:39 random...
00:28:40 Like, I try to get stuff out during Radcon
00:28:42 because for the audience, it's like,
00:28:44 we hype it up.
00:28:45 We're like, oh, Radcon,
00:28:46 we're going to be here for a week.
00:28:47 And then for them,
00:28:48 it's like they see a few live streams,
00:28:50 I guess, and nothing else happens.
00:28:52 And they're just like, oh, Radcon's fucking gay.
00:28:54 You know?
00:28:55 No, there has to be stuff coming out during Radcon
00:28:57 so people feel excited about the event.
00:28:59 It's my mentality.
00:29:00 But then, like,
00:29:02 doing all that work for the PCP,
00:29:04 I come home and there's nothing for my channel.
00:29:07 There's nothing for me to show
00:29:09 for Radcon 3.
00:29:11 And I haven't finished conceptualizing how they marketed.
00:29:14 And Davoo is still working on my other big video.
00:29:17 I don't remember if that came out
00:29:19 like before or after Radcon actually happened,
00:29:21 but I think it was afterwards.
00:29:22 I think it was working on it while I was there.
00:29:24 I think it was after, but I'm not sure.
00:29:25 So, all of that in mind,
00:29:28 when that Finish or Fail video finally came out,
00:29:30 it dramatically underperformed.
00:29:32 I'm expecting it to get like 300,000 views.
00:29:34 It gets like 50,000 views.
00:29:36 And its main purpose was to advertise how they marketed.
00:29:39 So, the fact that it failed
00:29:41 as an advertising platform for that series
00:29:44 already made me like, uh-oh.
00:29:46 Like, I fucked up.
00:29:47 Also, Finish or Fail took way too long to come out.
00:29:49 And at this point, I made another huge mistake.
00:29:53 I was really obsessed with Denzel Curry at the time, the rapper.
00:29:57 And I had the idea to make a documentary about him
00:30:01 because he was just starting to, like, blow up.
00:30:03 I don't remember that.
00:30:04 There were tons of interviews coming out with him.
00:30:06 And, like, his fan base was getting really passionate.
00:30:09 If I had done this documentary,
00:30:11 it would have been the best idea of any of the ideas I had.
00:30:14 It would have been, got by far the most views.
00:30:16 Denzel Curry blew up really big not long after this.
00:30:19 So, and he definitely would have retweeted my video.
00:30:22 So, like, and I knew all that at the time,
00:30:24 which is why I wanted to do it.
00:30:26 But adding in another big project,
00:30:28 which as I worked on it continually escalated in scope
00:30:31 because I kept wanting to make it better,
00:30:33 rewriting parts of it, doing more research, adding in more clips.
00:30:36 Suddenly, I've got just hours of interviews
00:30:39 downloaded on my computer that I have to sort through
00:30:41 if I want to find everything I want.
00:30:42 And I was just like, this project is becoming overwhelming.
00:30:45 Meanwhile, we're trying to house hunt to move to Boston.
00:30:48 We have to leave at the start of May, you know?
00:30:50 So, I've got, you know, this big hole in my content
00:30:54 from when I did RadCon.
00:30:56 I've got two big projects in the work.
00:30:58 Neither of them is close to done.
00:31:00 What do I do?
00:31:02 I'll record a bunch of Bloodborne Let's Plays,
00:31:05 and that will, I'll use those to, like,
00:31:07 just fill the gaps while I'm moving.
00:31:09 So, I record, like, 20 episodes of Bloodborne Let's Plays.
00:31:13 No, it had to be, like, 30 or 40 episodes,
00:31:15 but we released, like, 20 of them.
00:31:17 And then we had 20 more that were supposed to, like,
00:31:20 pad the gap after we moved.
00:31:22 But they, the hard drive, when we moved, like, failed.
00:31:26 So, I did not have access to these Bloodborne Let's Plays.
00:31:29 The second we moved, because we moved, you know,
00:31:31 on the first of the month,
00:31:33 is when my Patreon takes its monthly hit, right?
00:31:35 So, the Patreon, because of the fact that
00:31:38 for this past month, nothing has come out.
00:31:40 I'm working on two big projects.
00:31:42 Nothing's actually materialized.
00:31:44 My Patreon just goes,
00:31:46 straight down, lost, like, over $1,000.
00:31:50 Oh, my God, really?
00:31:52 Yeah, it went from, like, over $4,000 to around $3,000.
00:31:55 And this is right when I moved into a house
00:31:57 where the rent was $2,300 a month,
00:32:00 and I had to pay triple rent up front when I moved in
00:32:04 because of the fact that they didn't,
00:32:06 they let me move in because of my credit score,
00:32:09 but they said, like, they didn't think I made enough money.
00:32:12 So, like, to prove I had enough money,
00:32:14 they made me do, like, a triple down payment.
00:32:16 So, the end result of this is that it was also tax time
00:32:20 at the same time.
00:32:22 And when it came time for me to go to file my taxes,
00:32:25 because of the expenditure of the move
00:32:27 and the triple down payment,
00:32:29 I only had exactly enough in my bank account
00:32:32 to pay my taxes.
00:32:34 And I was like, clearly, I am not going to pay these
00:32:37 because that would leave me with no money
00:32:39 to move around with if anything bad happens,
00:32:41 and then something bad immediately happened
00:32:43 because me and May had a dual mental breakdown
00:32:46 about a month into living in Boston.
00:32:49 So, after that, everything was just, like,
00:32:51 all plans, any ideas up to that point
00:32:54 were just, like, all this is gone.
00:32:56 Like, I don't care about how they market it.
00:32:58 I don't care about anything.
00:32:59 I just care about making money
00:33:00 and pulling myself out of this tailspin
00:33:02 because I will be fucked
00:33:05 if this continues the way it is.
00:33:07 And it was immediately clear
00:33:10 when winter came,
00:33:12 like, we thought that we...
00:33:14 I loved the house that we were in
00:33:16 because it was big and weird
00:33:18 and had lots of odd hallways,
00:33:20 and I was like, I'm going to decorate this place
00:33:22 because it's super cool.
00:33:23 But, like, I couldn't afford to put anything in the house.
00:33:25 I was like, I have no money.
00:33:27 I had, you know, 15 grand in the bank,
00:33:29 but in my mind, that was just tax money
00:33:31 that needed to be held on to, you know?
00:33:33 I mean, if I think of it that way right now,
00:33:35 I have negative money in the bank.
00:33:37 But, like, you know, the...
00:33:39 Were we talking about Radcon 3?
00:33:41 Yes, we're the space between Radcon 3 and now.
00:33:44 Pardon me, Professor.
00:33:45 This is the How We Got Here story.
00:33:47 Okay.
00:33:48 So, Boston, huge bust,
00:33:51 lost a lot of money,
00:33:53 spent a lot of time recovering,
00:33:54 put out a video every day for a month,
00:33:56 and then I just spent, like, this whole interim time
00:33:58 trying to figure out, like,
00:33:59 what am I trying to do with my career?
00:34:01 Like, because I think I've pretty much
00:34:04 reached the height of what I think you can do
00:34:06 with, like, just anime analysis videos.
00:34:08 Like, my videos...
00:34:10 I've made a video that's, like, as good
00:34:12 as I think this can get at this point.
00:34:15 And, you know...
00:34:16 Do you have one specifically in mind when you say that?
00:34:18 I would say The Great Anime Director Who Time Forgot.
00:34:20 Okay.
00:34:21 Like, that video is my favorite one I've done,
00:34:23 and it's pretty much just perfect.
00:34:25 Like, there's nothing I'd change about it.
00:34:27 It's pretty much ideal, and, like,
00:34:29 having already made that, it's, like,
00:34:31 from that point forward, any new video I do,
00:34:33 like, I just think of it as, like,
00:34:34 try to make it that good.
00:34:36 Like, the one I did recently on The Most Underrated Anime.
00:34:39 Like, I would consider that pretty much the same.
00:34:42 It's not as well-edited,
00:34:43 because Davood didn't do it, but, like,
00:34:45 as good as you can really get with an anime analysis video.
00:34:47 And it's like, I want to see if I can do something else.
00:34:49 So I started working on lots of other projects
00:34:51 while we were in Boston.
00:34:52 I started writing novels.
00:34:54 Started trying to work on video games.
00:34:56 Me and Tom were constantly coming up
00:34:58 with all these crazy, big brain fucking ideas
00:35:00 that would usually fall through,
00:35:02 because we did not have time to work on them.
00:35:04 We did I Am Games.
00:35:06 We were live streaming.
00:35:07 Heavy into branding.
00:35:09 Constantly changing gears.
00:35:11 Finally moved to Virginia Beach after our release was up.
00:35:14 Everything has been much better since moving here.
00:35:17 Just quality of life.
00:35:19 Have money in the bank again.
00:35:21 Able to do things just more easily and better.
00:35:23 So, yeah, ever since moving here,
00:35:26 life has been great,
00:35:27 but it's also been moving extremely fast.
00:35:30 From my perspective,
00:35:31 it feels like I've only been here for like a couple months,
00:35:33 and it's been almost a year,
00:35:35 just because I have not stopped working.
00:35:38 And one of the coolest things about being
00:35:40 in the middle of the East Coast is
00:35:42 people tend to just be passing through.
00:35:44 So, like, mates passed through.
00:35:46 Don Jolly passed through one time.
00:35:49 Econ and Nino came up.
00:35:51 And so, like, I've just kind of been doing these, like,
00:35:53 micro-RAGCON-esque events
00:35:55 where, like, two people come to my house
00:35:57 and I just force them to make content all weekend.
00:35:59 And through that spawned can-tent,
00:36:02 so where do I hope to be by RAGCON 4?
00:36:05 Five. Five.
00:36:07 Depending on how long it takes,
00:36:10 my expectation is that the PCP will have
00:36:13 basically been cannibalized by can-tent
00:36:16 and IM games.
00:36:18 And that will be the central brand
00:36:21 that me and Nate will over with an iron fist.
00:36:24 Everyone who's not Nate and Digi are all like,
00:36:27 oh, okay, cool.
00:36:29 Well, uh...
00:36:31 One more reason not to support can-tent.
00:36:33 Well, there's nothing you can do to stop it
00:36:35 other than not watch, because there is no patreon yet.
00:36:37 But one day it's coming soon.
00:36:39 It does need you.
00:36:41 Keep an eye out for a Kickstarter, one of these great spots.
00:36:43 That would actually be really cool
00:36:45 if you guys started a patreon and split the fanbase
00:36:48 and there was a war, and the PCP finally...
00:36:50 I don't think you guys split the fanbase.
00:36:52 ...finally self-destructed and died.
00:36:54 Did the Pajikast cause a split amongst PCP fans
00:36:56 because it does a separate patreon?
00:36:58 I think that's too neat.
00:37:00 The degree is there. How do we know?
00:37:02 Okay, what I meant by cannibalizing the PCP
00:37:04 is not that it would cause any kind of yordle
00:37:06 than the audience. What I meant is that
00:37:08 can-tent would simply grow so large
00:37:10 that it would be in everyone else's best interest
00:37:12 to be a part of can-tent instead of the PCP.
00:37:14 That's my plan.
00:37:16 Yeah, sure. That would be pure benefit to everyone.
00:37:18 No, I'm not being...
00:37:20 I'm not being sarcastic. I want that to happen.
00:37:22 I know you do.
00:37:26 Yeah, you know, I forgot to mention can-tent.
00:37:28 I don't know. I always under...
00:37:30 I have such an aversion in life
00:37:32 to overselling things and overhyping things.
00:37:34 I'll do anything to avoid it.
00:37:36 I wouldn't know it's can-tent.
00:37:38 Because immediately after it started, basically,
00:37:40 there was the whole channels got...
00:37:42 That did happen to us. That was a big event.
00:37:44 Honestly, when the hack happened,
00:37:46 I made no assumption that it would ever come back.
00:37:48 I just assumed it was gone.
00:37:50 I was like, I'm not going to work on this until it's back.
00:37:52 I fucking... I'm not going to give
00:37:54 any energy to this.
00:37:56 For the record, that would just go into the fucking void.
00:37:58 Quick summary for the ages.
00:38:00 My fault the channels got hacked due to a fuck-up,
00:38:02 doing some deal installs and bad software.
00:38:04 Seven channels of ours got hacked,
00:38:06 but they are now all back.
00:38:08 They have all been restored, so that's good news.
00:38:10 We killed the guy responsible.
00:38:12 Brad is deceased, he will no longer live on today.
00:38:14 You'll all see the story of it.
00:38:16 It's quite deep.
00:38:18 It is truly a legendary tale.
00:38:20 Okay, so Nate hopes to be a YouTube
00:38:22 main man and be making money.
00:38:24 Yep.
00:38:26 Hippo wants to progress as an artist
00:38:28 and make more stuff
00:38:30 and be a real boy who makes comments
00:38:32 with that guy and say,
00:38:34 he makes comics.
00:38:36 Did you want to be making money?
00:38:38 I want to be better known as a writer
00:38:40 than as a video maker,
00:38:42 but I don't think that's going to happen by Radcon 5.
00:38:44 Oh, we didn't even talk about it.
00:38:46 You have a whole novel series that you're doing.
00:38:48 I have a novel series.
00:38:50 Let's try The Road to Radcon 4.
00:38:52 Yeah, everyone's favorite.
00:38:54 Road to Radcon 4, which we should work on
00:38:56 concluding while we're here.
00:38:58 But also Kusomega.
00:39:00 I have a very large...
00:39:02 My plans for Kusomega are quite
00:39:04 ambitious and I hope to have them
00:39:06 all done within the year.
00:39:08 But I want to make it like a...
00:39:10 I would describe it as like
00:39:12 a micro sprawling franchise.
00:39:14 Like, it has
00:39:16 elements of everything, but they're all
00:39:18 small, you know?
00:39:20 So that's like my vision for it.
00:39:22 Okay, so being a writer and making money.
00:39:24 Can 10, both of you.
00:39:26 Also, to answer the previous question,
00:39:28 what's the best thing to come out of Radcon so far?
00:39:30 The Brad Garlinghouse
00:39:32 lecture was probably my outright favorite
00:39:34 thing we've done so far.
00:39:36 I thought it was just so...
00:39:38 I mean, it felt that way in the moment.
00:39:40 I haven't seen it back, but it felt
00:39:42 really, really good.
00:39:44 The lectures have all been great.
00:39:46 It's enough for me.
00:39:48 Tom, you've been crippled for the past
00:39:50 like 100 years.
00:39:52 You gotta turn the camera to Tom.
00:39:54 I'm getting to it.
00:39:56 Yeah.
00:39:58 I've always been crippled my whole life, but now
00:40:00 it's just physically represented
00:40:02 in physical form.
00:40:04 So Radcon 3 to 4.
00:40:06 What's the journey?
00:40:08 Well, Radcon 3 ended.
00:40:10 It was pretty fucking good.
00:40:12 Then
00:40:14 everything, I guess, changed with my
00:40:16 content. Like, because me and Munchy were talking
00:40:18 up, we're gonna do Investigator,
00:40:20 we're gonna do Schloss, we're gonna be sick.
00:40:22 We did our art apology, we committed
00:40:24 Sepuku on camera.
00:40:26 It's weird to think that Radcon 3,
00:40:28 Investigator and Schloss, we're still
00:40:30 in the works. Yeah, they're still on the table.
00:40:32 We made big
00:40:34 bold promises that they're coming.
00:40:36 We basically said if we don't finish
00:40:38 these, we will kill ourselves and we're still
00:40:40 here and we lied completely.
00:40:42 You're doing...
00:40:44 Okay, comics are cool.
00:40:46 But you're making a video game?
00:40:48 Which is way cooler.
00:40:50 Well, he's not making a video game right now.
00:40:52 You have made a video game
00:40:54 and planned to make more.
00:40:56 You're not making a video game?
00:40:58 Well,
00:41:00 I got this whole big...
00:41:02 I talked about it in the video we did.
00:41:04 Yeah, go watch the Digi's creative consultation
00:41:06 with Tom Oliver where he talks about how
00:41:08 Azumi is currently
00:41:10 more expanding
00:41:12 as a brand beyond... It was always supposed to be
00:41:14 a multimedia brand character.
00:41:16 Since the game is taking so long to make,
00:41:18 it's currently looking like
00:41:20 doing other things with the characters.
00:41:22 Gotta build up the brand first, so then the game
00:41:24 can come in and be fucking
00:41:26 based as fuck and not cringe.
00:41:28 So pretty much all your
00:41:30 energy is on that?
00:41:32 Yeah, I'm trying because
00:41:34 someone is actually talking about this on the live stream last night
00:41:36 which is deleted, press F.
00:41:38 Somebody save it.
00:41:40 They were talking about why aren't you doing programming
00:41:42 and it's like, well, to make a really cool video game
00:41:44 you gotta do programming but you also need 3D
00:41:46 modeling and you also need animation.
00:41:48 And it's like, well, I can do coding
00:41:50 first and have nothing to show for it
00:41:52 because coding by itself is boring and no one cares.
00:41:54 Or I can learn the animation of the 3D
00:41:56 first and have tons of content
00:41:58 come out with that while I'm learning it
00:42:00 to build up the brand and then do the coding
00:42:02 and that seems like
00:42:04 the more intelligent path of acquiring these two.
00:42:06 This is typically why video games are made by teams
00:42:08 of people.
00:42:12 Toby Fox.
00:42:14 That's true.
00:42:16 So the idea right now is
00:42:18 I had this whole thing where
00:42:20 me and my friend Matt, we were doing
00:42:22 a big accountability group.
00:42:24 We had a bunch of people in there trying to keep ourselves hype
00:42:26 and then a bunch of people we brought in were all doing video games
00:42:28 and they peer pressured me into making a video game
00:42:30 and so when I came up with the Zoomie
00:42:32 my idea was like, okay.
00:42:34 I've been trying to make big, sprawling,
00:42:36 crazy fantasy stories for like a decade
00:42:38 and every single one of them has collapsed under its own bloat.
00:42:40 So what if I made a character
00:42:42 and worked in a way that was
00:42:44 purposely, completely opposite
00:42:46 all of my natural inclinations?
00:42:48 What if I just made a purely aesthetic character
00:42:50 with no story, with no lore
00:42:52 and it was just fucking cool
00:42:54 and that was the only guiding principle.
00:42:56 You could pull a George Stancy, the opposite of every natural instinctive guy.
00:42:58 Exactly.
00:43:00 And the character took off in a way
00:43:02 that nothing else I've ever done has.
00:43:04 People were doing fan art like instantly
00:43:06 and it was just like, I did it.
00:43:08 I figured it out. I cracked the code.
00:43:10 Gotta get those furry bucks apparently.
00:43:12 So, base.
00:43:14 They were just like, you gotta make a video game
00:43:16 so that's where the idea came from is like making a video game.
00:43:18 So the big moonshot project with like
00:43:20 all the fucking deep, cool things
00:43:22 is all in this video game that will happen in like 40 years.
00:43:24 But in the meantime
00:43:26 I made a cool like guilty gear style shader
00:43:28 so I can make cool 2D that looks 3D
00:43:30 or 3D that looks 2D.
00:43:32 It's fucking sick. It's gonna be dope.
00:43:34 And as soon as Radcon is over
00:43:36 it's back to the grindstone
00:43:38 and I got like
00:43:40 4 books and comics and like 4 commas
00:43:42 and animations and maybe doing some
00:43:44 AMV music videos. It's just like learning 3D
00:43:46 learning animation
00:43:48 and just putting a zoomie on everything
00:43:50 and hopefully that'll work.
00:43:52 Tom, I think
00:43:54 they're making some sort of like
00:43:56 new train system
00:43:58 that's better than the meter rail.
00:44:00 It goes from Worcester to Boston.
00:44:02 So when that happens, move to Worcester
00:44:04 so we can actually see each other.
00:44:06 Cause we live like the same state
00:44:08 when you're like a decade
00:44:10 you're gonna get Tom before I get Tom.
00:44:12 I have empty rooms in my house
00:44:14 my friend.
00:44:16 Is there still hope
00:44:18 or intention for that to happen?
00:44:20 I mean, it'd be cool.
00:44:22 Tom has said from the start
00:44:24 that he has no desire to live in Boston
00:44:26 as he hates Boston.
00:44:28 It's not even that I hate Boston.
00:44:30 I hate cold.
00:44:32 Cold is really bad.
00:44:34 The Nor'easters have been a blight on my life
00:44:36 ever since I was a wee lad
00:44:38 and they never end.
00:44:40 I hate that a lot.
00:44:42 I don't know.
00:44:44 I'm still hoping out hope that somehow
00:44:46 we can all
00:44:48 converge on one location
00:44:50 because it is still the dream.
00:44:52 It will never move to Virginia Beach. Virginia Beach can suck shit.
00:44:54 Damn.
00:44:56 We've had a great time this whole week.
00:44:58 This is not Virginia Beach.
00:45:00 You say that, but one day the dollars
00:45:02 could tell a different story.
00:45:04 That's stupid.
00:45:06 We'll say it.
00:45:08 We don't want it to happen.
00:45:10 What a weird sinister sentence to say to someone.
00:45:12 Ben's always so dimmical.
00:45:14 Guys, nothing on this fucking earth could ever
00:45:16 compel me to leave this city where I have
00:45:18 some connections to some places.
00:45:20 I lived here for a year and it sucked.
00:45:22 They would like completely change your life.
00:45:24 But being a bitch, I don't want to move to your dumb city.
00:45:26 It's not my city.
00:45:28 Well, you're moving there.
00:45:30 I mean, maybe.
00:45:32 You're the one with the head of it.
00:45:34 Ben, it's like a moral, like, indignation
00:45:36 against cars.
00:45:38 Well, yeah, sure.
00:45:40 I also don't like Virginia Beach.
00:45:42 What?
00:45:44 I mean, for what it's worth, at the time, I didn't like Virginia Beach
00:45:46 because we lived in the shittiest part of Virginia Beach.
00:45:48 Now I love it.
00:45:50 Every location to be is identical
00:45:52 because I live inside and I don't do anything.
00:45:54 So I have no interest in where I live.
00:45:56 This is someone who's lived their entire lives
00:45:58 in their bedroom and then finally once he moved to Boston
00:46:00 and was able to realize, oh wait, the outside is cool.
00:46:02 I go outside every single day now.
00:46:04 I use the public transport every single day.
00:46:06 Look, I live in...
00:46:08 Then it pays $500 rent, right?
00:46:10 Or around there?
00:46:12 Less than $500.
00:46:14 So he's literally able to live in Boston and have a great time.
00:46:16 Thanks for having my back.
00:46:18 It's a shitty place to live.
00:46:20 I would rather live, I don't know, like California.
00:46:22 Somebody's nice, Hawaii.
00:46:24 That would be nice.
00:46:26 The reality of my life is that I am inside working.
00:46:28 The quality of life, things better.
00:46:30 Being here in Virginia Beach is way better than the place I live currently.
00:46:32 But the reality today
00:46:34 is that I'm inside doing it.
00:46:36 Honestly, the reason I live in a better place
00:46:38 is because it would make my girlfriend happier
00:46:40 and she would be much happier living here.
00:46:42 That's the main reason that it even matters to me a little bit.
00:46:44 Other than that, I mean,
00:46:46 if there's any degree of just more convenience
00:46:48 by living in a place that's just less nice,
00:46:50 that, like, work is my priority.
00:46:52 Being able to do my work well
00:46:54 and efficiently and whatever,
00:46:56 that's, like, 90% of what I care about in life.
00:46:58 And then the other 10%.
00:47:00 So, I mean, if people don't agree with that, fair enough.
00:47:02 But that's just why I think
00:47:04 that I don't care where I am.
00:47:06 I'll just do anything as long as it has, like, the bare minimum shit
00:47:08 that I need to get by.
00:47:10 I'll travel to places once in a while
00:47:12 when I fucking feel like it and go do fun things.
00:47:14 I don't think anyone's opposed to coming to Virginia Beach to hang out.
00:47:16 Except Ben, he just said that he is.
00:47:18 I said I would never move.
00:47:20 I said to hang out, yes.
00:47:22 Okay, fair enough.
00:47:24 I'm going to go to Virginia Beach and that's okay.
00:47:26 Ben just put in this, like, it will never happen, man.
00:47:28 Because he doesn't want to live here before.
00:47:30 I don't want to come here before.
00:47:32 I mean, for what it's worth,
00:47:34 like, it's not as though we need Ben to move down here.
00:47:36 Like, he can come, like you said, visit anytime.
00:47:38 Yeah, there's very clear, like, network of people
00:47:40 who, like, can work together.
00:47:42 What happened in Boston, particularly
00:47:44 at Radcon 3.33,
00:47:46 like, what became clear, at least to me,
00:47:48 was that, like,
00:47:50 Munchie and Ben
00:47:52 have no real interest in, like,
00:47:54 being YouTubers and, like,
00:47:56 making a main, central pillar of their life
00:47:58 be doing YouTube content.
00:48:00 It's like, you guys want to do Endless War,
00:48:02 you want to do your own art, you have your own community.
00:48:04 There are literally only two people in this room
00:48:06 whose goals are remotely similar.
00:48:08 Right. And it's Nate and Digi.
00:48:10 Exactly. You guys should have a blast.
00:48:12 You guys should have a blast.
00:48:14 But, well, you say that it's only two people
00:48:16 except that Tom also has,
00:48:18 like, for him it's quite easy
00:48:20 to just kind of
00:48:22 be in things
00:48:24 with us, like,
00:48:26 I don't know, for Tom,
00:48:28 Tom and I have talked a lot about his
00:48:30 I'm trying to, like, not speak for you
00:48:32 while you're not paying attention, but, like...
00:48:34 I was just checking chat
00:48:36 because nothing was going wrong.
00:48:38 Because you've talked about before how, like,
00:48:40 you have your own work
00:48:42 and you're very passionate about, like, your personal projects
00:48:44 but you also find it almost easier
00:48:46 to, like, just work on someone else's thing
00:48:48 and, like, be a part of that.
00:48:50 Especially if it benefits you monetarily.
00:48:52 As someone who's been a fucking hermit their entire lives
00:48:54 and has no real-life connections,
00:48:56 collaboration is cool, especially when
00:48:58 it's in person with other people
00:49:00 and you can vibe off each other's hype
00:49:02 because the hardest thing for me to do on my solo projects
00:49:04 is motivation
00:49:06 because everything I feel like I'm doing myself
00:49:08 inherently has less value
00:49:10 because I'm a broken man.
00:49:12 But, like, and when you and I were trying to work together
00:49:14 on I Am Games, like, it always came down to, like,
00:49:16 I have my own YouTube career
00:49:18 but, you know, I would take time away from that
00:49:20 to try to make I Am Games more of a thing
00:49:22 and you have your 3D career
00:49:24 and you try to take time away from that
00:49:26 to make this more of a thing.
00:49:28 But, like, ultimately, it was, like,
00:49:30 you know, one of us
00:49:32 would have had to make it, like,
00:49:34 the real focus of our career
00:49:36 for a while for it to work.
00:49:38 But, like, me and Nate
00:49:40 are living in the same spot
00:49:42 and we were, like, we had the time
00:49:44 to do a show, like, that we could
00:49:46 put more focus into.
00:49:48 Then I feel like it's
00:49:50 it makes more sense for you and I to do that
00:49:52 when, like, you know, our goals are literally the same
00:49:54 whereas yours are, like, more ancillary
00:49:56 to that. It's, like,
00:49:58 you know, you're not trying to be a YouTuber
00:50:00 you're just down to do YouTube videos
00:50:02 if there's, like, a successful venture
00:50:04 here that you can easily slot yourself into, you know?
00:50:06 It doesn't even have to be successful
00:50:08 just, like, hey, there are people that are, like, doing cool things.
00:50:10 I'll be a part of it. Why not?
00:50:12 You know, successful is a
00:50:14 subjective term. And to me, any
00:50:16 channel with, like, 1,000 subscribers
00:50:18 is successful in my mind.
00:50:20 Like, because that's so high above
00:50:22 the baseline of what I had before I started having
00:50:24 subs that, like, a thousand subs
00:50:26 to me is always, like, oh, you've already got your foot in the door,
00:50:28 you know? Sure, sure.
00:50:30 Anyway, I don't know what I'm talking about.
00:50:32 So, Ben.
00:50:34 Yes, where have you been
00:50:36 since the last radical? Where do you hope to be?
00:50:38 Uh, I guess we made
00:50:40 Endless War. Yes, we did.
00:50:42 That was pretty funny and wacky.
00:50:44 Uh...
00:50:46 Like, a month after we got back from
00:50:48 my country. From my
00:50:50 perspective, it has always seemed like that has just
00:50:52 been you guys' entire lives
00:50:54 since then, but is that how it's always
00:50:56 happened? Basically.
00:50:58 Um, kinda.
00:51:00 For a while, I was, like,
00:51:02 making the game
00:51:04 and then, like, lately
00:51:06 I haven't really been making it, but I've been working
00:51:08 on Slime and Punishment, which is adjacent to it.
00:51:10 Um...
00:51:12 Uh, I don't know what else to say
00:51:14 about the time in between. I mean, I guess I was
00:51:16 making more comics. You moved back
00:51:18 to Boston. I moved back to Boston. I did the
00:51:20 Vapors 2 Kickstarter, which I was still waiting
00:51:22 on. I'm sorry.
00:51:24 It's okay.
00:51:26 Uh...
00:51:28 Um...
00:51:30 I had two kidney stones.
00:51:32 That was my favorite part.
00:51:34 Uh...
00:51:38 Lost 50 pounds
00:51:40 got really woke.
00:51:42 Gained 50 pounds in my energy.
00:51:44 Uh...
00:51:46 I don't know.
00:51:48 I've just been
00:51:50 fuckin' around.
00:51:52 Fuckin' around on my tablet in Manga Studio
00:51:54 making a bunch of bullshit
00:51:56 for, like, two years.
00:51:58 Where do you want to be the retcon 5?
00:52:00 Um...
00:52:02 I was doing the same thing, but with more
00:52:04 people watching.
00:52:06 That's it. Not more money, more people
00:52:08 watching. I mean,
00:52:10 tomato tomato.
00:52:12 Uh...
00:52:14 I don't know. Is that a boring one?
00:52:16 Yes, extremely
00:52:18 excruciating. Cool.
00:52:20 I'll probably, if we end up doing...
00:52:22 That was torture.
00:52:24 I totally forgot I was supposed to do
00:52:26 those creative consultation videos with everybody,
00:52:28 but if I did one with you, one of the questions
00:52:30 Tom is, like, is there a dollar
00:52:32 amount you're, like, hoping to reach?
00:52:34 Um...
00:52:36 What, on Patreon?
00:52:38 Yeah. Not just, like, through your Patreon,
00:52:40 just, like, in, like, your total income
00:52:42 in a month. Like, is there, like,
00:52:44 a number that you visualized yourself as,
00:52:46 like, oh, I'd be, like, really happy if I was
00:52:48 just making this amount?
00:52:50 Um...uh...
00:52:52 I kind of feel like I already am past the
00:52:54 threshold of, like,
00:52:56 I make enough that I can keep
00:52:58 doing what I'm doing and I won't die.
00:53:00 That's good.
00:53:02 Is that your only ambition, though?
00:53:04 Yeah, pretty much.
00:53:06 No, not really. That's so cool.
00:53:08 It's pretty fucking smart.
00:53:10 It's pretty fucking awesome.
00:53:12 As long as...just gotta keep my
00:53:14 biological functions continuing
00:53:16 so I can keep generating
00:53:18 digital imagery
00:53:20 to be disseminated throughout culture.
00:53:22 Yeah.
00:53:24 That's the only goal.
00:53:26 I don't know what song it is.
00:53:28 I don't know what song it is.
00:53:30 I don't mind stealing bread
00:53:32 from the mouths of
00:53:34 Nicaragans.
00:53:36 Wait, wait.
00:53:38 But then he says,
00:53:40 well, I can't feed on the underfed
00:53:42 when my cup's already
00:53:44 overfilled
00:53:46 so I'm going hungry.
00:53:48 I'm going hungry!
00:53:50 Hey!
00:53:52 Sure.
00:53:54 I guess that's me.
00:53:56 Excellent.
00:53:58 I guess that sums it up, huh?
00:54:00 Do you have any other aspirations whatsoever?
00:54:02 Do you want everything to be exactly the same?
00:54:04 But you have more money now.
00:54:06 What would I change?
00:54:08 I don't know.
00:54:10 You don't have to improve in some way
00:54:12 that I can't understand
00:54:14 because I'm not you.
00:54:16 I'll just get better
00:54:18 doing my shit now.
00:54:20 That'll just happen.
00:54:22 I don't have to worry about it.
00:54:24 That'll just happen naturally.
00:54:26 We are desperate for some insight
00:54:28 into the mystery of Ben Sane.
00:54:30 I don't know what you want me to tell you, dude.
00:54:32 I knew this would happen.
00:54:34 I'm just vibing over here.
00:54:36 I'm just vibing over here.
00:54:38 He's just vibing.
00:54:40 Jesse, do you care?
00:54:42 Do you care about your own life?
00:54:44 What?
00:54:46 What happened between Radcon 3 and now?
00:54:48 Everything bad
00:54:50 and nothing good?
00:54:52 No, everything was already happening at the point of time.
00:54:54 That's true.
00:54:56 I don't know.
00:54:58 The entire period
00:55:00 of my life
00:55:02 between 2016
00:55:04 and 2020
00:55:06 is just a constant
00:55:08 dark spiral
00:55:10 of abject misery
00:55:12 and pain.
00:55:14 Then I moved and I guess I got a little bit better.
00:55:16 Now I'm here.
00:55:18 Where do you want to be
00:55:20 by Radcon 5?
00:55:22 Rich.
00:55:24 I mean me too.
00:55:26 I don't know.
00:55:28 I've been like really
00:55:30 I'm in this
00:55:32 transitionary period
00:55:34 of realigning
00:55:36 goals and pursuits
00:55:38 of really trying to branch out
00:55:40 and get back to being a human
00:55:42 and doing stuff outside of the YouTube bubble.
00:55:44 I've been
00:55:46 I've been
00:55:48 I've been getting back into stand-up.
00:55:50 I've been doing some stand-up stuff.
00:55:52 That was really legendary.
00:55:54 Back a million years ago.
00:55:56 I've been
00:55:58 learning how to have fun again.
00:56:00 Teach me about that
00:56:02 because I don't know what that's like.
00:56:04 I got into edibles.
00:56:06 Oh, never mind.
00:56:08 Exactly.
00:56:10 I started going to the movie theater alone
00:56:12 and that's pretty fucking cool.
00:56:14 And so
00:56:16 I try to take
00:56:18 some time for me
00:56:20 out of the week where I just go in my car
00:56:22 and on some adventure
00:56:24 to anywhere.
00:56:26 Sometimes I'm like I'm going to go to the big movie theater
00:56:28 two cities over
00:56:30 and sometimes I'm like no, fuck that.
00:56:32 I'm going to go to the woods and walk around
00:56:34 in the woods and explore.
00:56:36 And sometimes I'm like I'm going to do some
00:56:38 other shit. I don't fucking know.
00:56:40 So anyways, I've been doing the stand-up thing.
00:56:42 I've been working out a lot.
00:56:44 And my ultimate goal with the working out
00:56:46 is to get my body
00:56:48 looking really good and then
00:56:50 finally do
00:56:52 what I was supposed to do
00:56:54 10 years ago which is
00:56:56 trained to be a professional wrestler.
00:56:58 Thank God.
00:57:00 This was the turning point
00:57:02 mistake of my entire life.
00:57:04 When I got out of high school
00:57:06 a million years ago or so
00:57:08 I had like
00:57:10 people give you money at your
00:57:12 open house or whatever so I had
00:57:14 like a thousand dollars or something
00:57:16 which at that point was the most money I'd ever seen in my life.
00:57:18 And
00:57:20 I was looking up wrestling schools because I didn't know what else
00:57:22 to fucking do with my life
00:57:24 and it just seemed cool
00:57:26 and I found a guy
00:57:28 Truth Martini. He had a wrestling school.
00:57:30 He's a cool guy. I've seen him on TV
00:57:32 and like Ring of Honor and stuff.
00:57:34 So he's a real man
00:57:36 and I'm like okay I'm going to go to Truth Martini's
00:57:38 wrestling school. It was like a thousand bucks to get in
00:57:40 but then it was also
00:57:42 like a thousand bucks for like a laptop
00:57:44 and
00:57:46 I bought the laptop and I started making
00:57:48 videos on YouTube
00:57:50 and it was the fucking
00:57:52 it was the ground zero of my entire
00:57:54 horrible life. That one decision
00:57:56 ruined everything
00:57:58 so now
00:58:00 even though
00:58:02 I'm not 20 anymore and it might be too
00:58:04 late
00:58:06 but I do have
00:58:08 I still harbor these aspirations
00:58:10 of being involved in that business
00:58:12 some way in an official capacity
00:58:14 either as a wrestler
00:58:16 or even as a manager or an announcer
00:58:18 whatever the fuck
00:58:20 but my goal is right now
00:58:22 to get in shape which has always been a goal anyways
00:58:24 because I've been out of shape for many fucking years
00:58:28 so I'm doing that. I'm doing stand up.
00:58:30 I'm trying to I want to do more
00:58:32 like get more into music and stuff
00:58:34 I'm glad with people. I've been like
00:58:36 reconnecting with friends that I've let
00:58:38 friendships that have gone to the wayside
00:58:40 as I've been more sucked into the
00:58:42 YouTube lifestyle
00:58:44 I've been hanging out with my friend Cody the Roo
00:58:46 I've been acting more. We've been like
00:58:48 writing skits. I wrote a pilot
00:58:50 that we're planning on filming at some point
00:58:52 for a 6 sci-fi series
00:58:54 it's gonna be dope
00:58:56 Flint Rat films
00:58:58 YouTube is the channel
00:59:00 and
00:59:02 yeah, I'm just branching
00:59:04 and even to the point of
00:59:06 looking up
00:59:08 normie work which has always been
00:59:10 a dream of mine is to just be
00:59:12 You mean movies? Is that what you mean by normie
00:59:14 work? Well no, that's part
00:59:16 of my creative sickness
00:59:18 but I've been looking up
00:59:20 like give me a fucking job
00:59:22 please you know
00:59:24 Oh, normie work is when you work with your hands
00:59:26 and you okay
00:59:28 I think that's normie artwork
00:59:30 No, we're like
00:59:32 I used to work on a farm
00:59:34 before all this started I was like a gardener
00:59:36 and like a sheep shearer
00:59:38 what do they call the guys who
00:59:40 heard the fucking bastards
00:59:42 Shepard, yeah, that was my job
00:59:44 I can't remember the name of it but that was my job
00:59:46 for a while
00:59:48 you know, bailing and stacking hand stuff
00:59:50 and like I loved working on the farm
00:59:52 like I love physical labor
00:59:54 and it's like
00:59:56 my body's pretty broken down now from
00:59:58 sitting at a computer desk for 11 years
01:00:00 but like man, I don't know
01:00:02 fucking put a hard hat on me
01:00:04 let me be, I fucking, the movie
01:00:06 they live with Rowdy Rowdy Piper
01:00:08 which is
01:00:10 supposed to be like a dystopia
01:00:12 right? He starts out the movie
01:00:14 he's living in a shanty town
01:00:16 just like he just walks into a construction
01:00:18 site and gets a job and it's supposed to be
01:00:20 like this is the beginning of the movie where he's
01:00:22 like poor and destitute and it's the sad part
01:00:24 but like I was watching the movie again
01:00:26 the day I'm like this part of the movie
01:00:28 that is the poor, humble beginnings
01:00:30 is my dream I just want to
01:00:32 wander into a town and be
01:00:34 ripped and buff and
01:00:36 someone puts a hard hat on me
01:00:38 and I live in a shanty town and eat beans
01:00:40 out of the can and work
01:00:42 physical labor every day and get my little
01:00:44 my $250 paycheck
01:00:46 and that'd be
01:00:48 pretty fucking cool
01:00:50 those are achievable goals
01:00:52 but then also like I found, I was like
01:00:54 looking for other work and I found
01:00:56 like I started looking for writing jobs
01:00:58 because that's a thing that I'm actually good at
01:01:00 and so I found one that was like
01:01:02 looking for a
01:01:04 science fiction ghost writer
01:01:06 and it's like we're a magazine or something
01:01:08 just like in that episode
01:01:10 of Star Trek Deep Space Nine
01:01:12 where Captain Sisko
01:01:14 was in the 1950s
01:01:16 as a science fiction writer
01:01:18 it was like hey, we're a science fiction
01:01:20 publication or whatever
01:01:22 we just want someone to
01:01:24 write the prose, we'll give you the characters
01:01:26 and the big story beats
01:01:28 and you figure out what to do
01:01:30 and I'm like I could apply for that fucking job
01:01:32 that'd be fucking sick
01:01:34 just write a novel and get paid for it
01:01:36 and not have to like, huh?
01:01:38 where do you even find job listings like that?
01:01:40 like Craigslist and shit
01:01:42 the same way that normal people all over
01:01:44 the world find jobs
01:01:46 I finally realized oh yeah I can do that too
01:01:48 I don't have to be on fucking podcasts
01:01:50 every week of my life
01:01:52 wait, sorry
01:01:54 if you have more you can go, I just remembered something
01:01:56 I don't want to interrupt though
01:01:58 no I mean that's pretty much it
01:02:00 I mean I still, I'm pretty much a retired
01:02:02 YouTuber at this point and like I'm kind of like
01:02:06 I'm kind of at the point where like
01:02:08 it's time for Endless just to go away
01:02:10 like he's had his run
01:02:12 it was mostly a failure
01:02:14 he can be, I can like
01:02:16 I don't know redefine him or something
01:02:18 like you know I get bored, I got bored of drowning in footwear
01:02:20 I got bored of drowning in horseshoes
01:02:22 I'm kind of bored of
01:02:24 Endless just and it's like
01:02:26 I don't know maybe like I'll keep the name
01:02:28 as like a rap name or something but like
01:02:30 I'm really considering like
01:02:32 completely changing my channel
01:02:34 and all my channels and like
01:02:36 finding a way to do something do everything
01:02:38 entirely differently than how I've been doing it
01:02:40 I feel the temptation to do that
01:02:42 about every month and then I
01:02:44 do that about every six months
01:02:46 well I have
01:02:48 plans that I don't want to go into
01:02:50 but I am thinking of like doing stuff differently
01:02:52 and I still
01:02:54 am making videos
01:02:56 because I have to keep the revenue coming in from Patreon
01:02:58 but that's all it is
01:03:00 I keep getting comments and I keep having to
01:03:02 clarify this of people like
01:03:04 where is Jess? Jess never uploads
01:03:06 videos anymore, Jess doesn't
01:03:08 make videos, I make videos
01:03:10 I have videos coming out every month
01:03:12 they're just not on YouTube I don't post
01:03:14 them publicly because I don't care
01:03:16 I have zero desire
01:03:18 or inclination to be a public figure at
01:03:20 all it is a cancer and a poison
01:03:22 in my life every second that
01:03:24 I am not being
01:03:26 a public figure I am much happier
01:03:28 so
01:03:30 like I am still making content
01:03:32 I am a creative person and that's never going to
01:03:34 change but
01:03:36 most of it is like exclusive to Patreon
01:03:38 right now while I figure out
01:03:40 what the hell else I'm doing in this
01:03:42 transitory
01:03:44 period of like
01:03:46 fuck it you know what I'm saying
01:03:48 you know what I'm saying
01:03:50 Ben would you forget
01:03:52 oh I was thinking
01:03:54 ok you were talking about finding
01:03:56 normie work I
01:03:58 haven't really been thinking about this because
01:04:00 I have been
01:04:02 before Radcon I was trying to crank out
01:04:04 the finale to slime and punishment
01:04:06 and um I haven't really
01:04:08 I don't know
01:04:10 but sometimes when I'm not
01:04:12 like when I'm not working on something like that
01:04:14 sometimes I think about
01:04:16 looking for work as like
01:04:18 like if I wanted to get like a job job
01:04:20 I would really like it
01:04:22 if I could be some kind of artist
01:04:24 on a project like an indie game
01:04:26 if I could be like an in-house artist for an indie game studio
01:04:28 I think that would be cool
01:04:30 or basically any project
01:04:32 that like wasn't overly
01:04:34 restrictive that like an artist's role
01:04:36 on any project that like I could
01:04:38 that I could like have
01:04:40 some creative like input on
01:04:42 that I wouldn't have to like stick really rigidly
01:04:44 to a template or something
01:04:46 I would just
01:04:48 like um I don't know
01:04:50 like when you made t-bap
01:04:52 I was the guy who did the art for t-bap
01:04:54 it would be cool if there were other things
01:04:56 that I could work on and I wouldn't even be
01:04:58 too too picky about it just anything
01:05:00 that like I could work on and then
01:05:02 if people saw it they'd be like oh
01:05:04 you're the guy who did the art for whatever
01:05:06 x thing
01:05:08 I guess I could even
01:05:10 do it for like a
01:05:12 like a comic or something
01:05:14 it's just so fucking hard
01:05:16 every once in a long while
01:05:18 I'll go on Craigslist and I'll just look
01:05:20 for like art gigs
01:05:22 and it's all shit and I give up immediately
01:05:24 I've looked like the only like
01:05:26 indie game jobs I've been able to see
01:05:28 is like UI designer
01:05:30 for like a mobile app and I'm like
01:05:32 no that's nightmare
01:05:34 that's like worse than working on a cubicle
01:05:36 honestly that sounds
01:05:38 totally thankless and pointless
01:05:40 and just like a waste of human effort
01:05:42 makes me sad
01:05:44 okay who's next
01:05:46 it's a tough thing to pin down
01:05:48 I'm sure there are opportunities out there
01:05:50 there are people who want artists but
01:05:52 how to find them
01:05:54 why pay artists when you just go on twitter
01:05:56 steal their artwork
01:05:58 go on google.com and google
01:06:00 sick UI and then just download that
01:06:02 but then you could also google search
01:06:04 hot anime pussy and then you could
01:06:06 jack off instead of doing that
01:06:08 at all so what's the point
01:06:10 I find this
01:06:12 interesting broadly speaking
01:06:14 aspiring to normie job
01:06:16 aspiring to normie job maybe kind of thinking that
01:06:18 you think that's a normie job
01:06:20 that's not really a job
01:06:22 in a sense that's not a feature
01:06:24 I don't really aspire
01:06:26 I don't aspire to that
01:06:28 I would only do that because it would be
01:06:30 like boy I should
01:06:32 lights are falling
01:06:34 I only think about that because it's like
01:06:36 maybe living
01:06:38 on just enough money
01:06:40 to not die immediately
01:06:42 is like a little dangerous
01:06:44 it's risky
01:06:46 maybe I should
01:06:48 aim a little higher than that
01:06:50 financially speaking
01:06:52 well if I was going to pursue that
01:06:54 I guess it wouldn't be too bad
01:06:56 to do it in this way
01:06:58 the way I just described
01:07:00 working on art in a way
01:07:02 that's not really restrictive
01:07:04 I would be okay with that
01:07:06 the ultimate goal
01:07:08 is that I can just fuck around
01:07:10 and make whatever I want
01:07:12 and I'll have a big enough
01:07:14 or dedicated enough audience
01:07:16 that I can just survive on that
01:07:18 if I were to go and do a job like that
01:07:20 my dream scenario would be
01:07:22 the lights are falling
01:07:24 is that on?
01:07:26 okay cool
01:07:28 they've been up the whole week
01:07:30 they've been good boys
01:07:32 the dream scenario
01:07:34 is that I do that
01:07:36 maybe I work for a studio or something
01:07:38 we make a project and I do the art for it
01:07:40 and it's hugely successful
01:07:42 and then I gain cloud
01:07:44 and it's like oh you're the guy
01:07:46 who made the thing for that thing
01:07:48 oh I know your work
01:07:50 and then I gain
01:07:52 my own audience
01:07:54 this is really your coke or a wish
01:07:56 you want a game, complete
01:07:58 no I just want cloud
01:08:00 I just want cloud
01:08:02 because cloud is
01:08:04 cloud is life
01:08:06 because if you got cloud
01:08:08 people will pay you
01:08:10 people will support you
01:08:12 just because it's you
01:08:14 that's what I want
01:08:16 I want to make my shit
01:08:18 and I don't want to work for anyone else
01:08:20 because I'm a communist
01:08:22 and I don't want anyone else extracting surplus value
01:08:24 from me because that's rape
01:08:26 and I don't want that
01:08:28 is it fair to say who aspired to be a demagogue?
01:08:32 what do you mean?
01:08:34 to be a cult leader
01:08:36 cloud man who gets to bend people to his will
01:08:38 and enact vengeance in the world
01:08:40 well my schools have so far seen purely financial
01:08:42 which is so sick
01:08:44 I wouldn't say no
01:08:46 if I type saw that on Craigslist
01:08:48 I might send in a resume
01:08:50 cult leader wanted
01:08:52 I'm just talking about being independent
01:08:54 I'm just talking about being able to
01:08:56 survive
01:08:58 without
01:09:00 getting bossed around by the man
01:09:02 you know if you could apply
01:09:04 to a cult leader position
01:09:06 the sort of internship experience
01:09:08 that you would need would be
01:09:10 being a youtuber
01:09:12 yeah that's what you're saying
01:09:14 um
01:09:16 oh
01:09:18 I was going to say in terms of cloud
01:09:20 I don't know if any of you ever used it back in like
01:09:22 2012-2013
01:09:24 there was a website
01:09:26 why would you do that?
01:09:28 shut up
01:09:30 to victor
01:09:32 love you bro
01:09:34 there was a website back in like 2012-2013
01:09:36 it might even still exist
01:09:38 called cloud with a K
01:09:40 and you would just type in your name
01:09:42 and one of your social media accounts
01:09:44 it would rank you in like how much
01:09:46 cloud you had
01:09:48 it was extremely confusing
01:09:50 and nobody could figure out
01:09:52 we have social blade now
01:09:54 which also is not
01:09:56 really that accurate
01:09:58 both of them are like
01:10:00 both can make you seem like you're way more famous than you are
01:10:02 they definitely seemed like
01:10:04 best case scenarios
01:10:06 and as someone who was living the worst case scenario
01:10:08 definitely not representative
01:10:10 like it's funny because like
01:10:12 Saber Spark has almost a million subscribers right now
01:10:14 and like on social blade they say
01:10:16 he makes like $500,000 a year
01:10:18 and he's just like
01:10:20 not even
01:10:22 remotely close
01:10:24 well we've all answered this question now
01:10:26 let's go to other piece of your memory
01:10:28 Gino, what have you been doing
01:10:30 since we were at con 3?
01:10:32 no
01:10:34 well I wanted to hear from Gino
01:10:36 he's a star and he's continuing to be
01:10:38 a star, thanks Gino
01:10:40 alright Munchy, bore us with your story now
01:10:42 hey
01:10:44 what?
01:10:46 there's a sibling rivalry going on
01:10:48 Gino's like the new guy, he's so fucking huge
01:10:50 I know what I'm saying
01:10:52 it's magnificent
01:10:54 what happens in the last
01:10:56 I mean in this war like you were saying
01:10:58 that's been my whole life
01:11:00 and since it stopped being your whole life
01:11:02 it's become my whole life
01:11:04 I'm still, I'm not like active on the server
01:11:06 I'm making slime
01:11:08 nah I gotcha
01:11:10 I'm not as involved in the servers
01:11:12 you are
01:11:14 your presence has still fell
01:11:16 that's the most important thing
01:11:18 just don't forget me
01:11:20 I say
01:11:22 so I'm in punishment finale
01:11:24 it's coming out like
01:11:26 probably like right after redcon's done
01:11:28 ouch
01:11:30 I've gotten into doing because of endless war
01:11:32 and because of other stuff and getting really into
01:11:34 weird stuff and that's kind of
01:11:36 what will lead into where do I want to be
01:11:38 but redcon 5, just like
01:11:40 in case you don't know
01:11:42 for a thousand times, but in case you don't know
01:11:44 in this war is a game
01:11:46 that me and Ben made
01:11:48 it's about slime
01:11:50 oh of course, I started to crack
01:11:52 in punishment
01:11:54 and you can play it
01:11:56 and you can enlist and rise your killers
01:11:58 and those are our games and you should play it now
01:12:00 do it, please
01:12:02 what are we going to get
01:12:04 endless war 2
01:12:06 it's time, I need the new version
01:12:08 I need 3D graphics
01:12:10 I need microtransactions
01:12:12 I need a season pass
01:12:14 why do you need a sequel to a game
01:12:16 that's an ever evolving organism
01:12:18 because I
01:12:20 I'm against live services
01:12:22 as a principle
01:12:24 it's a bad business value
01:12:26 what about free live services
01:12:28 the jury is still out on that one
01:12:30 I love free things and I hate live services
01:12:32 so it's just like
01:12:34 what?
01:12:36 I guess that's why I don't play
01:12:38 I don't know what to feel about it
01:12:40 while making
01:12:42 endless war and while
01:12:44 doing other miscellaneous podcasts
01:12:46 and stuff, I kind of realized that
01:12:48 podcasts are boring
01:12:50 not that I have a human hatred of them
01:12:52 or that they're like, oh I hate them
01:12:54 I want them to die
01:12:56 maybe
01:12:58 we'll let the viewers decide
01:13:00 I guess
01:13:02 I don't know, I just don't really like
01:13:04 personality driven content that I make
01:13:06 because I don't really like doing it anymore
01:13:08 but it's cool if you like it
01:13:10 and so
01:13:12 I was doing endless war
01:13:14 there's nothing more boring to me than my own personality
01:13:16 you feel the same way?
01:13:18 yeah I do
01:13:20 and so I was doing endless war, I was ramping down
01:13:22 doing all other sort of personality driven
01:13:24 podcasts and shows like that
01:13:26 I traversed the world
01:13:28 on a summer of pain too
01:13:30 I went to hippo's house, we did game for a day
01:13:32 and I did a road trip
01:13:34 and it was nice, I've really been trying
01:13:36 to focus on being like a human being
01:13:38 because like for all my entire life
01:13:40 all I would do is sit in my room
01:13:42 and I wouldn't leave my house at all
01:13:44 and I realized that's like a bad recipe
01:13:46 for being an artist because if you're in your room all day
01:13:48 then you're gonna make really bad, boring art
01:13:50 which I was making
01:13:52 and so I decided to get out of the house
01:13:54 and instantly I felt my quality of life
01:13:56 immediately improved just by leaving the house
01:13:58 and talking to my real life friends
01:14:00 for even like a second and it was great
01:14:02 that branched into going to college
01:14:04 and I started my first semester in college
01:14:06 and I'm in my same semester right now
01:14:08 hashtag split break, hashtag fuck pussy
01:14:10 hashtag free Cuba, hashtag
01:14:12 80 million dead
01:14:14 and it's been really
01:14:16 very interesting
01:14:18 I've been very happy that I went
01:14:20 I feel like being an actor
01:14:22 in the world which is something I have not been
01:14:24 since I was a wee lad
01:14:26 I have not like talked to people
01:14:28 that I don't know IRL
01:14:30 since I was like 12
01:14:32 and so it's a very interesting
01:14:34 cool experience and I'm happy to be moving along
01:14:36 in my real life
01:14:38 and I think that that will improve my art
01:14:40 as I think it has been
01:14:42 with stuff like once in cactus and in this war
01:14:44 continuing to be interesting and cool
01:14:46 so where do I want to be in Radcom 5
01:14:48 I want to, I have ideas
01:14:50 and I want to get into specific projects
01:14:52 but here's where my brain is at
01:14:54 I want to make new experimental art
01:14:56 using technology
01:14:58 during the between the last two Radcom
01:15:00 or the last Radcom me and Tom
01:15:02 were killing Code Hall, where is it law
01:15:04 well I'll tell you where killing Code is
01:15:06 it's in endless war and elsewhere
01:15:08 and in lonesome cactus
01:15:10 that's where killing Code is where all my energy and my brain power is
01:15:12 I became a coding god man
01:15:14 and I want to use coding to make weird experimental art
01:15:16 I want to be personality based
01:15:18 I want to make cool fiction to make people happy
01:15:20 and I want to live my life like a normal person
01:15:22 but also be weird, freak at the same time
01:15:24 I just want to be a person in the world
01:15:26 doing cool shit, I don't care about making podcasts
01:15:28 I don't care about YouTube, I just want to make cool art
01:15:30 that's experimental and cool
01:15:32 hell yeah, hell yeah
01:15:34 I don't think any of us really
01:15:36 wants to do personality driven content
01:15:38 well the why is it that everyone does
01:15:40 because it's easy to expect
01:15:42 I don't consider what I do to be personality driven content
01:15:44 wait
01:15:46 who so mega isn't
01:15:48 who so mega isn't
01:15:50 but your entire thing is like
01:15:52 there is a YouTube trap
01:15:54 that we all fell into for a while
01:15:56 did you make a video about
01:15:58 I find this director interesting
01:16:00 these are the reasons why
01:16:02 yeah I guess that's his personality
01:16:04 as to why he thinks it's why
01:16:06 all my videos are about things
01:16:08 okay okay
01:16:10 I don't think that being
01:16:12 like I don't think it's a binary
01:16:14 or a personality driven show or not
01:16:16 I think there are degrees
01:16:18 I think that like
01:16:20 historically at the very least
01:16:22 you have presented yourself
01:16:24 as content
01:16:26 people interpret it that way
01:16:28 I think when you're
01:16:30 starting out as an artist
01:16:32 a good way to market yourself
01:16:34 is to make it personality driven
01:16:36 and to make it seem like
01:16:38 it's not just my art that's good
01:16:40 I'm also good look at me I'm important
01:16:42 you kind of have to go through that phase
01:16:44 and do that
01:16:46 but I think all of us here
01:16:48 have done that for long enough
01:16:50 and now we can maybe make something more humble
01:16:52 I think injecting my personality
01:16:54 and my content has mostly
01:16:56 only ever heard it
01:16:58 I think that my content would have always been
01:17:00 way more popular if I never injected myself into it
01:17:02 I sometimes feel similarly
01:17:04 wasn't there a whole like idea
01:17:06 where it's like your videos are drifted away
01:17:08 and that's how you were during like modal
01:17:10 soul days and that big long vlog
01:17:12 where you started doing colored chip
01:17:14 hue value things and you're like
01:17:16 oh let's get back to the real Digi Bro
01:17:18 and your entire fucking entire
01:17:20 brand is the Godzilla journalist
01:17:22 it's my opinion and nobody liked it
01:17:24 nobody was into that at all
01:17:26 that was when I started losing all my patrons
01:17:28 and people were like stop doing drugs
01:17:30 and making your vlogs purple
01:17:32 how is the rant hole not personality
01:17:34 personality driven content that is your main source
01:17:36 they're all about things
01:17:38 like pay for you because they like your personality
01:17:40 it's not
01:17:42 personality isn't everything about what's in your brain
01:17:44 it's also just like your thoughts
01:17:46 I was going to say the rant hole
01:17:48 after dark is personality based
01:17:50 is it
01:17:52 but maybe that's not the main
01:17:54 I don't know if you consider that your main thing
01:17:56 after dark is dead it's just rants now
01:17:58 well yeah, rants then
01:18:00 the rants
01:18:02 is it that they want my personality
01:18:04 or that they want my perspective
01:18:06 they want both
01:18:08 I think of those as different
01:18:10 no I don't think that's different
01:18:12 okay
01:18:14 when I think personality driven content
01:18:16 this is retarded
01:18:18 all content that has anything to do
01:18:20 with your views on something just is bad
01:18:22 is this the point being made
01:18:24 maybe it's not
01:18:26 you would have to be purposely trying to be the most
01:18:28 stupid person on earth to think that that's what we're saying
01:18:30 and intentionally trying to
01:18:32 mis-ingenderize
01:18:34 all art
01:18:36 is autobiographical inherently
01:18:38 that's why the author is objectively wrong
01:18:40 but
01:18:42 it's okay to say
01:18:44 this project doesn't have to be about me
01:18:46 every once in a while
01:18:48 okay
01:18:50 so the way I would put it is like this
01:18:52 when I go into making a video
01:18:54 the mentality is like
01:18:56 here's an idea, here's a thought I had
01:18:58 how can I express that idea
01:19:00 in a way where the audience will best understand it
01:19:02 the way that I understand it
01:19:04 and if the
01:19:06 like if that thought
01:19:08 is a natural result
01:19:10 of my personality
01:19:12 it will require a lot of my personality
01:19:14 and explaining myself to get to that explanation
01:19:16 and I think that
01:19:18 most people
01:19:20 view that as egotistical
01:19:22 and it's not egotistical
01:19:24 it's just autistic
01:19:26 I don't have enough reference to refer to things
01:19:28 other than myself to explain things
01:19:30 so like
01:19:32 there's always been this idea that
01:19:34 Digi makes content about himself
01:19:36 and it's like that's true
01:19:38 but it's always just kind of been because
01:19:40 it's easy to make content
01:19:42 it's easy to use yourself for comparison
01:19:44 it's easy to say here's what I would do in that situation
01:19:46 you know
01:19:48 I think it's sort of like
01:19:50 the end goal
01:19:52 by
01:19:54 a method to get people
01:19:56 to care about an anime
01:19:58 is to tell a personal story or an anime
01:20:00 which is what you do
01:20:02 what personality driven content would be
01:20:04 is a vlog channel where
01:20:06 my life is the content
01:20:08 Casey Neistat I would consider personality driven content
01:20:10 and it's not just
01:20:12 him himself
01:20:14 but his editing style
01:20:16 has a personality
01:20:18 and it is the draw of the video
01:20:20 nothing that happens in the videos is interesting
01:20:22 at all almost ever
01:20:24 it's just his daily life
01:20:26 it's purely his energy
01:20:28 his editing style
01:20:30 and yes a lot of people watch me for those reasons
01:20:32 and I do think that
01:20:34 most of my patrons are
01:20:36 fans of my personality
01:20:38 probably above most other things
01:20:40 but I don't consider
01:20:42 the personality to be
01:20:44 what is driving the videos
01:20:46 individually and if it is it's usually
01:20:48 not a good thing
01:20:50 we need to step way back
01:20:52 this is not judgment of good versus bad
01:20:54 personality does not mean bad
01:20:56 the only reason I was saying that it was
01:20:58 boring is because what Ben said
01:21:00 I view my own personality as boring
01:21:02 I think most personality
01:21:04 driven content is boring
01:21:06 because nobody is as interesting as concepts are
01:21:08 so inherently
01:21:10 something like Casey Neistat's videos again
01:21:12 they have an aesthetic kind of vibe
01:21:14 I might resonate with him
01:21:16 as a person but there is no
01:21:18 intellectual content I forget those videos
01:21:20 as quickly as I've seen them
01:21:22 they are just fluff entertainment content
01:21:24 that makes you feel
01:21:26 good for the duration of watching it
01:21:28 and I think that my stuff
01:21:30 can have that effect and that is a good
01:21:32 benefit of the content but what I hope
01:21:34 my content does is get you to think about
01:21:36 the stuff I'm talking about
01:21:38 if your main take away is
01:21:40 I love listening to DigiBro's voice
01:21:42 I'm glad you had a good time
01:21:44 that wasn't the point here
01:21:46 hopefully you also thought about what I was talking about
01:21:48 it does have to be one or the other
01:21:50 I feel like it's a very clear spectrum
01:21:52 it's undeniable
01:21:54 that a lot of DigiHeads
01:21:56 just like you and will follow you
01:21:58 to the edge of the earth
01:22:00 it's totally fair to say that people like me
01:22:02 for my personality
01:22:04 it's just that I feel a lot of the same way
01:22:06 that you do about
01:22:08 I find myself annoying and boring
01:22:10 I don't like to listen to my own
01:22:12 podcasts and stuff
01:22:14 in fact most of what I release
01:22:16 these days if it's a podcast I do not listen to it back
01:22:18 I just publish
01:22:20 because unless I can remember
01:22:22 that there was something that has to be edited out
01:22:24 I will go back and do that
01:22:26 to me it's just like
01:22:28 I'm over listening to myself
01:22:30 endlessly about things
01:22:32 I just have endless ideas
01:22:34 and so I will provide those
01:22:36 to the rest of you who do want to hear me
01:22:38 you have endless ideas
01:22:40 we have endless wars
01:22:42 true
01:22:44 and I have
01:22:46 endless jobs
01:22:52 thank you
01:22:54 we can go on for over an hour
01:22:56 we're fucking done with this question
01:22:58 it was that one question
01:23:00 it was one question
01:23:02 I mean that was just the topic of the
01:23:04 it became just the topic
01:23:06 I guess it did
01:23:08 that was like two years of time
01:23:10 it was a good topic
01:23:12 I mean assumably
01:23:14 episode 100 would have happened around
01:23:16 Radcon 3 right?
01:23:18 yes it did
01:23:20 well then this was a good topic
01:23:22 thank you to whoever suggested it
01:23:24 there were more questions
01:23:26 there were
01:23:28 most of them were kind of slight variants
01:23:30 and they weren't that cool but I will go through them again
01:23:32 just for the sake of completion
01:23:34 I know we will see
01:23:36 I'll grab my phone now that it's charged
01:23:38 and look through them too
01:23:40 it was a big old time
01:23:42 everybody continually to talk about this question
01:23:44 this is very cool
01:23:46 they had rablon about something
01:23:48 that no one cares about
01:23:50 who said that
01:23:52 give me a name
01:23:54 no no one said that
01:23:56 I'm saying you do that while I look for this
01:23:58 not necessarily
01:24:00 that you always do that
01:24:02 but please for once find it in you
01:24:04 to be boring
01:24:06 I can't
01:24:08 no where inside
01:24:10 anything that's not just astonishing
01:24:14 Bernie's only 150 delegates
01:24:16 oh yeah
01:24:18 Bernie Sanders dude
01:24:20 hell yeah
01:24:26 so how about that
01:24:28 coronavirus
01:24:30 dude I definitely have it
01:24:32 dude they might cancel WrestleMania
01:24:34 I'm hearing
01:24:36 the NBA
01:24:38 how am I going to find out what happens
01:24:40 to AJ Styles
01:24:42 calling the undertaker a cock
01:24:44 it's a great question
01:24:46 most of these questions are variations
01:24:48 of what we were just discussing
01:24:50 there's one where it's like
01:24:52 how much of the peace of the change
01:24:54 since the last ritecon
01:24:56 is there like a lifejack going on
01:24:58 again if you donated
01:25:00 a certain amount to the kickstart
01:25:02 for ritecon 4 you're able to become a PTA member
01:25:04 a secret discord for those PTA members
01:25:06 where they can tell us things to do at ritecon 4
01:25:08 and this is one of the things that they can tell us to do
01:25:10 they're going to ask us questions
01:25:12 so that's what is happening right now
01:25:14 is this a live stream
01:25:16 or a pre-recorded thing
01:25:18 that's what I thought
01:25:20 there is a chat but we're not looking at it
01:25:22 those people didn't buy their way
01:25:24 well what if someone's super chat
01:25:26 we'll check later
01:25:28 can you do this more than god intended
01:25:30 if there's no questions
01:25:32 there's a super chat but we won't read it
01:25:34 yes
01:25:36 destroy it
01:25:38 I mean maybe we want to
01:25:40 exit maybe
01:25:42 what are your daily morning routines
01:25:44 I saw that one I didn't know if that would be interesting
01:25:46 does anybody have a morning routine
01:25:48 here's my morning routine
01:25:50 oh hey by the way this is the thing that started
01:25:52 since the last ritecon which has like a couple posts
01:25:54 my munchie scripts
01:25:56 tumblr check that out
01:25:58 for the content about what I'm going to say
01:26:00 way into like
01:26:02 basically using machines to rule my life
01:26:04 for me because I can't be trusted to make a decision on my own
01:26:06 so here's what I have here's my morning routine
01:26:08 I get up
01:26:10 my alarm is going off and I set it up
01:26:12 so I made a thing where
01:26:14 my phone will only stop
01:26:16 doing the alarm when I scan a QR code
01:26:18 that is inside of my shower
01:26:20 so I have to go to my shower
01:26:22 to scan a QR code so that my alarm
01:26:24 will turn off and then
01:26:26 once I'm there I'm like I have my clothes already
01:26:28 set up there from the night before
01:26:30 so I literally just get into the shower
01:26:32 so I don't have like a decision making process
01:26:34 like oh do I want to get up right now do I just want to hit snooze
01:26:36 no I'm already in the shower
01:26:38 I already have my clothes here man
01:26:40 I might as well get naked and shower
01:26:42 so that's my morning routine
01:26:44 then I get up sometimes I get breakfast
01:26:46 but I usually don't because breakfast is fucking stupid
01:26:48 and then I just start working or go to school
01:26:50 and that's my morning routine
01:26:52 what app does that
01:26:54 there is an app called
01:26:56 it is
01:26:58 alarming for Android
01:27:00 and you can see it so we'll scan a
01:27:02 barcode or a QR code and I made a QR code
01:27:04 that says wake up and then
01:27:06 I have begun to settle into more of a general
01:27:08 routine for my days in life
01:27:10 that's good as opposed to like
01:27:12 the dark times where
01:27:14 my life was just an endless fog
01:27:16 of grey matter
01:27:18 read munchy strips you'll vibe on
01:27:20 guess it you'll vibe hard
01:27:22 where do you find munchy strips
01:27:24 you've seen it before you've read it before
01:27:26 it's my time oh munchy strips
01:27:28 yeah
01:27:30 I've gotten into a routine of like
01:27:32 I wake up I fucking
01:27:34 you know brush my
01:27:36 ass and shit my teeth or whatever the fuck
01:27:38 and I fucking
01:27:40 I fuck around and I go to the gym for a couple hours
01:27:42 and then I come home
01:27:44 and then I usually just fucking chill
01:27:46 and I do that for like
01:27:48 the first 20 days
01:27:50 of the month about and then I remember
01:27:52 that I have to create content
01:27:54 to get paid
01:27:56 and so then I like cram on the last fucking
01:27:58 day of the month like oh my god I have to do something
01:28:00 on Patreon oh my god oh my god what have I done
01:28:02 and so it's
01:28:04 and then like I have like a
01:28:06 my day off from the gym
01:28:08 where I instead of going there I go on
01:28:10 a silly adventure to like the woods or like
01:28:12 a comedy club or something or some city
01:28:14 and
01:28:16 and then also I travel a lot all across the country
01:28:18 because my fucking girlfriend is on the side of the country
01:28:20 and I'm fucking terrible
01:28:22 and yeah we're desperately
01:28:24 both of us trying to save money
01:28:26 to get a place together
01:28:28 but it's also hard because
01:28:30 seeing each other costs money
01:28:32 so every time that we see each other
01:28:34 it bleeds from the funds
01:28:36 of saving up to see each other permanently
01:28:38 so
01:28:40 how can we help you to save money?

01:29:18 have a really good life hopefully
01:29:20 I'll tell you my morning routine
01:29:22 because it used to be that I just
01:29:24 jumped out of bed immediately
01:29:26 went straight to the computer and just
01:29:28 went about my day
01:29:30 but now that I
01:29:32 have a wife and usually
01:29:34 wake up at the same time
01:29:36 it's more like we
01:29:38 battle over whether
01:29:40 we're going to get out of bed or not
01:29:42 for about 45 minutes
01:29:44 I finally do and
01:29:46 most of that time is
01:29:48 me in the back of my mind thinking
01:29:50 okay on the one hand
01:29:52 I really want to get up and smoke weed
01:29:54 immediately but on the other hand
01:29:56 this bed is very comfy
01:29:58 and I have the warm
01:30:00 love of my wife so I'm going to stay
01:30:02 here as long as I can
01:30:04 but the second I get up
01:30:06 I'm going straight to the bomb
01:30:08 so the second I get up I go straight
01:30:10 to the bomb
01:30:12 usually though
01:30:14 actually I'm exaggerating because
01:30:16 usually what we do is
01:30:18 anything that needs to get done for the day
01:30:20 I try to get it done like the second we
01:30:22 wake up so that I can start smoking
01:30:24 so like it's usually
01:30:26 like oh
01:30:28 we'll wake up and I'll be like what do you need to do today
01:30:30 and it's like we got to get groceries
01:30:32 we got to go here and then we just do that
01:30:34 right away get food while we're out
01:30:36 come home
01:30:38 I smoke and then eat
01:30:40 and then I spend
01:30:42 usually the afternoons just
01:30:44 chilling, smoking and watching
01:30:46 shit and then at night I just work
01:30:48 constantly and
01:30:50 and sometimes the work doesn't end
01:30:52 that sounds like a pretty good routine honestly
01:30:54 for so long I got into this rut
01:30:56 of just like
01:30:58 timeless nothing where because I had no
01:31:00 structure to my days and it was
01:31:02 just like a meandering like I got a
01:31:04 piss and shit now I got to eat now I got
01:31:06 a computer set on my desk now
01:31:08 where like the months would just
01:31:10 go by and bleed into each other and I wouldn't
01:31:12 know what's happening
01:31:14 it's sounding like you are
01:31:16 going to have to be under quarantine for two weeks
01:31:18 when you get back home
01:31:20 what like self quarantine
01:31:22 I don't know
01:31:24 I don't want to be in a box
01:31:26 what is this
01:31:28 is it a europe thing or is it a UK thing
01:31:30 I don't know may just message me
01:31:32 and said hippo might end up in quarantine
01:31:34 for two weeks when he goes back
01:31:36 we are on a podcast
01:31:38 I don't know if you forgot because these people just
01:31:40 said things randomly but you can continue
01:31:42 what you were saying on this
01:31:44 art that you are supposed to consume
01:31:46 for that to watch
01:31:48 well I guess my point is that once I did
01:31:50 get out of that situation and the whole
01:31:52 furnace room basement era
01:31:54 which was not good
01:31:56 and I know that it was a meme that it was not good
01:31:58 made Jesse sad again guys he was way better
01:32:00 when his life was worse
01:32:02 I made it a meme
01:32:04 that it was not good
01:32:06 I guess so that's true
01:32:08 I made it into a joke
01:32:10 and a meme to cope with it
01:32:12 but that does not really
01:32:14 express exactly how terrible
01:32:16 it really was however bad
01:32:18 I made it out to be it was worse
01:32:20 it was much worse for a very long time
01:32:22 but like
01:32:24 and because of that
01:32:26 I was kind of like stifled
01:32:28 as a human
01:32:30 like not being able to
01:32:32 figure out like what I even
01:32:34 wanted like I couldn't see a light
01:32:36 at the end of the tunnel and like as soon as
01:32:38 like that changed and I got out of it
01:32:40 and like
01:32:42 I'm not saying that everything is great but like
01:32:44 there is a light now and like I have
01:32:46 I have goals and like
01:32:48 I have things I know I can do to reach
01:32:50 those goals but I'm like
01:32:52 as soon as I was out of there
01:32:54 I was able to
01:32:56 like figure out
01:32:58 who the fuck I am now
01:33:00 like when it started I was like
01:33:02 22 and then I became like a
01:33:04 gormless mass of depression
01:33:06 for eight years with no
01:33:08 personality beyond that
01:33:10 and so now I'm like
01:33:12 figuring out and like I had two
01:33:14 epiphanies
01:33:16 that have like almost completely
01:33:18 changed my entire mindset
01:33:20 I realized
01:33:22 for the first time
01:33:24 one that I have always been
01:33:26 a hippie
01:33:28 two that I have always been
01:33:30 a fucking cowboy white trash
01:33:32 hick and now that I finally
01:33:34 cowboy baby
01:33:36 and now that I understand like I finally
01:33:38 realized like all my everything that I feel
01:33:40 all these like emotions
01:33:42 and philosophies that I've internally
01:33:44 that I cannot articulate or express
01:33:46 I finally realized oh wait
01:33:48 it's because I'm literally a fucking hippie
01:33:50 the like the formative
01:33:52 years of my life were spent on
01:33:54 a hippie commune
01:33:56 that's why I am the way I am
01:33:58 and then
01:34:00 I also realized and then before that
01:34:02 I grew up in a fucking trailer park
01:34:04 and I have I've got the hick
01:34:06 in me and like I just need to embrace
01:34:08 that so I started I started like
01:34:10 I really buying all these like crazy
01:34:12 horse albums just like just
01:34:14 injecting Neil Young into my bloodstream
01:34:16 and just I know what you're talking about
01:34:18 when I moved down here it just so happened
01:34:20 that the song that like the new big song
01:34:22 was that
01:34:24 yeah
01:34:26 they said the tax man and I was like
01:34:28 I haven't paid my taxes they took my car
01:34:30 and I got hooked on oxy
01:34:32 code and I was like hey I need drugs
01:34:34 they shut the lights off
01:34:36 hey I don't pay my bills
01:34:38 I want to kill myself too
01:34:40 I feel exactly at home here
01:34:42 so now that I finally understand about myself
01:34:44 that I've always been a hippie cowboy
01:34:46 I can finally like
01:34:48 base my goals and decisions
01:34:50 and the way I live my life
01:34:52 around that and it's been a vast
01:34:54 improvement because now I realize
01:34:56 I do want to wear
01:34:58 flannel and cowboy boots all the time
01:35:00 I do just want to drive around
01:35:02 and like adventure all over America
01:35:04 and like see different cities
01:35:06 and like have Memphis barbecue
01:35:08 and fucking you know and I do just want to
01:35:10 fucking do drugs all the time
01:35:12 and hang out in my bed and be fucking cool
01:35:14 and shit and now that I
01:35:16 figured that out it's like hell yeah
01:35:18 bro
01:35:20 vibin
01:35:22 epic
01:35:24 hey here's a question

01:36:22 paint a better face on your real face
01:36:24 what is each of your preferred methods
01:36:26 of wiping your ass with no toilet paper
01:36:28 I fucking hate wiping my ass
01:36:30 it is the fucking worst part of my day
01:36:32 every day of my entire life
01:36:34 have you thought about investing in a
01:36:36 he knows
01:36:38 I think about it every goddamn day of
01:36:40 my life on this earth I pray to the gods
01:36:42 please somewhere get me to a place
01:36:44 in life where I can
01:36:46 where I can afford to install a bidet
01:36:48 in my fucking toilet
01:36:50 dude I had a bidet I hated it
01:36:52 how could you hate such a wonderful thing
01:36:54 I mean I tried it once
01:36:56 and it felt horrible and I was like never again
01:36:58 what feels horrible then
01:37:00 like it's like a fucking
01:37:02 scratched paper onto your butthole
01:37:04 no that feels fine
01:37:06 well I wet the toilet paper
01:37:08 so it's gently
01:37:10 wait how do you wet it
01:37:12 what ball it up run it under the faucet
01:37:14 for a second this is the most passionate
01:37:16 I've ever been on the PCP podcast
01:37:18 I hate wiping my ass
01:37:20 I fucking hate it more than anything
01:37:22 in life I've never heard it before
01:37:24 basically you do it before are you shit and then you like
01:37:26 no no it's shit
01:37:28 and then I ball up some toilet paper and then I run it under the faucet
01:37:30 just get it a little wet
01:37:32 if I have to
01:37:34 how far away is the sink from the fucking toilet
01:37:36 most bathrooms are not that big
01:37:38 you cannot get up after
01:37:40 you have to wipe and then get up
01:37:42 you cannot get up
01:37:44 wait wait
01:37:46 when you get up
01:37:48 you're walking and watering around and it's just spreading your shit
01:37:50 yeah no it's spraying shit
01:37:52 you can do it in a way
01:37:54 that like your cheeks don't move
01:37:56 and you don't get shit over your ass
01:37:58 you squat and knock
01:38:00 well I mean just like a little
01:38:02 like a bird
01:38:04 like in my bathroom
01:38:06 all I have to do is just kind of twist to the side a little bit
01:38:08 and I get
01:38:10 all I have to do from the toilet
01:38:12 is like twist it a little bit to the side
01:38:14 and I can get it wet and it's fine
01:38:16 you're fucking disgusting
01:38:18 you don't even fucking wet your toilet paper when you fucking wet
01:38:20 where would I meet you
01:38:22 I can share me an ultrasonic
01:38:24 it's just fucking spot
01:38:26 it's you cleaner
01:38:28 okay I'm gonna waste water
01:38:30 I'll tell you
01:38:32 that's shit
01:38:36 there was somebody who called into the dick show
01:38:38 one time because dick swears by the bidet
01:38:40 and this man said
01:38:42 if you got shit on any other part of your body
01:38:44 would you only use a dry
01:38:46 implement to wash it off
01:38:48 this is true I thought about this
01:38:50 shut the shit down I gotta step in
01:38:52 I want to have a story because I use the bidet in Japan
01:38:54 if you want to hear the bidet story
01:38:56 that's a fucking nightmare
01:38:58 second of all let's get fucking wet wipes
01:39:00 yeah that's just basically
01:39:02 use wet wipes
01:39:04 wait hold on he's not galaxy brain
01:39:06 because I have a problem with wiping my ass
01:39:08 and it might just be
01:39:10 because I'm unhealthy and fat
01:39:12 but this motion
01:39:14 causes my rib
01:39:16 this area you are fat
01:39:18 sear with pain
01:39:20 go under the front
01:39:22 hold on
01:39:24 you get your balls
01:39:26 oh sweaty on
01:39:28 my argument
01:39:32 wet wipes are not
01:39:34 are you not wiping your ass because you're in pain
01:39:36 no I am wiping my ass
01:39:38 I'm just fucking suffering that's why I'm saying
01:39:40 wiping your ass sucks
01:39:42 what's your preferred method of wiping your ass
01:39:44 when there's no toilet paper
01:39:46 I don't understand the question
01:39:48 if you don't have toilet paper how do you wipe your ass
01:39:50 there's only one way
01:39:52 you stick your ass over the sink
01:39:54 and you just wash it with water
01:39:56 and you just wash that
01:39:58 of course I've done that before
01:40:00 that's enough you have to
01:40:02 if you don't have toilet paper
01:40:04 you don't have to sink and not the shower
01:40:06 I mean if you don't have toilet paper
01:40:08 I guess my first emergency method
01:40:10 would be like well maybe
01:40:12 I'll just like find a paper towel
01:40:14 and then I'll just vary
01:40:16 I will tell you that I have both had to use the paper towel
01:40:18 I've had to use the just jump in the shower
01:40:20 yeah just jump in the shower
01:40:22 yeah
01:40:24 in Vietnam they use leaves
01:40:26 where do you get leaves when you're in your bathroom
01:40:28 I mean well they shit out in the woods
01:40:30 this is a topical question to ask
01:40:32 because toilet paper
01:40:34 sold out everywhere because America's retarded
01:40:36 and you know this question
01:40:38 that's why I always keep leaves in my purse
01:40:40 that's why I always keep leaves in my purse
01:40:42 because I don't have toilet paper
01:40:44 unironically isn't that
01:40:46 one of the reasons Japanese people carry around
01:40:48 those tissues
01:40:50 because like in a lot of Asian countries
01:40:52 those are the only toilet paper
01:40:54 the fuck that's a terrible kind of toilet paper
01:40:56 in the Philippines
01:40:58 public bathrooms almost never have toilet paper
01:41:00 aren't there like some like weird like
01:41:02 limitations of like certain places in Asia
01:41:04 where you can only use like X amount of squares
01:41:06 of toilet paper and then you're fucked
01:41:08 and then you're on your own after that
01:41:10 but the actual answer to this was
01:41:12 like okay you either find toilet paper
01:41:14 or you do what you gotta do without toilet paper
01:41:16 and in some situations
01:41:18 that's just gonna get fucked
01:41:20 we're in a public restroom
01:41:22 about the idea of just using my hands
01:41:24 and then washing my hands afterwards
01:41:26 unironically, yeah
01:41:28 you gotta do it
01:41:30 you have the tools
01:41:32 it's literally easier to wash your hands
01:41:34 than your butt, we should all be wiping with our hands
01:41:36 I mean kind of
01:41:38 that is the way
01:41:40 I don't sign off on this
01:41:42 wait, I will never shake hands again
01:41:44 if this becomes the cold shoulder
01:41:46 it's due to all the motions though
01:41:48 it's easier to wash your hands
01:41:50 it's just more work from the think of it
01:41:52 all you'd be doing is smearing shit with your hands
01:41:54 no, not true because I mean you can get yourself
01:41:56 there's just no good solution to the problem
01:41:58 of shit and there never will be
01:42:00 it drives me bonkers
01:42:02 unironically had the thought that like
01:42:04 toilet paper is a sign that we are still
01:42:06 barely out of the fucking cave
01:42:08 we haven't even gotten to the three
01:42:10 seashells yet
01:42:12 one day I'm gonna become elevated
01:42:14 hey, here's a totally separate question
01:42:16 we might have answered this before
01:42:18 but it's just a good one on a occasion such as this
01:42:20 is it full of rifa?
01:42:22 wait, wait, wait, before you do that
01:42:24 I wanna adjust this, because son of Marowak
01:42:26 said to talk about the failure of the poll yesterday
01:42:28 and he was mad all day because
01:42:30 okay, we played
01:42:32 Super Smash Bros. last night
01:42:34 because at the moment
01:42:36 that Nate checked the poll
01:42:38 Super Smash Bros. was ahead by one point
01:42:40 by the time we started
01:42:42 streaming this was no longer the case
01:42:44 Scott Pilgrim was winning
01:42:46 there had to be a cutoff point
01:42:48 it was just that moment when Nate
01:42:50 looked at his phone that he said
01:42:52 smash is ahead by one point, that's what we're playing
01:42:54 so to you it seems like a cruel deception
01:42:56 but in reality it was just bureaucratic
01:42:58 delays caused
01:43:00 this incident
01:43:02 but perhaps we'll make it right
01:43:04 in the future, we'll see
01:43:06 okay, is it full of rifa? just ask
01:43:08 what video should I introduce
01:43:10 you to new people as the PCP
01:43:12 any suggestions?
01:43:14 did he mean specifically the PCP
01:43:16 or like each of us in the video?
01:43:18 sure
01:43:20 Nate, who? what?
01:43:22 it's gotta be Ben
01:43:24 you're in log in part 1 and part 2
01:43:26 or like I would say
01:43:28 for your videos, if you're into smash
01:43:30 watch any of the smash videos
01:43:32 it depends what they want to see
01:43:34 my favorite
01:43:36 best guy ever video
01:43:38 is Uncovered Final Fantasy 15
01:43:40 and Head in Hell
01:43:42 and Evening in Hell
01:43:44 that one is probably
01:43:46 incomprehensible if you don't know
01:43:48 what the fuck was going on
01:43:50 which nobody did, so the video is incomprehensible
01:43:52 basically everybody but me and you
01:43:54 happened to witness this weird
01:43:56 Final Fantasy event
01:43:58 but also
01:44:00 I have a BGE Essentials playlist
01:44:02 for a reason, I choose
01:44:04 to be all the best contents in there
01:44:06 so link up that playlist
01:44:08 but also
01:44:10 what would be the best for getting into the PCP though?
01:44:12 just like episode 1
01:44:14 I mean there's probably better episodes
01:44:16 things we can't get into
01:44:18 is the one that most people see
01:44:20 your thing last night
01:44:22 was unironically
01:44:24 kind of fulfilled that function
01:44:26 at least in terms of
01:44:28 finally being
01:44:30 able to explain some part
01:44:32 of this madness that is my life
01:44:34 in a way that makes sense to me
01:44:36 I did like that about it
01:44:38 but that's free PCP history
01:44:40 means it needs to die
01:44:42 the first episode was me
01:44:44 on it
01:44:46 that one's good too
01:44:48 things I can't get into the episode
01:44:50 there's your easy answer
01:44:52 there's a helicopter
01:44:54 there's a big loud noise
01:44:56 I know a loud man, Munchy
01:44:58 what should people get into for you?
01:45:00 it's gotta know
01:45:02 that you have to
01:45:04 get into this warplay
01:45:06 you basically have to know who me and Ben are already
01:45:08 I would say either
01:45:10 first episode of Armour Treeble
01:45:12 and then follow that through
01:45:14 and read Humphduck with us
01:45:16 The Deal Nation Lecture obviously is a classic
01:45:18 and then if not that
01:45:20 then The Spice of Bro packed
01:45:22 or still in your dad
01:45:24 the first live episode
01:45:26 any of those
01:45:28 I guess give or you
01:45:30 for me

01:46:28 old-school underground mix tape which is where I took a bunch of my best
01:46:33 verses from all my other albums and made like a very accessible version of them
01:46:38 so like that album is pretty much just designed to be like your intro to
01:46:43 Digi Bro music kind of experience. I always really like the art is all about pushing your buttons or
01:46:48 turning that one. Art is all about pushing your buttons. It's the first thing in the
01:46:52 essential Digi Bro playlist. The essential Digi Bro playlist is not a collection of my best
01:47:00 videos but just the ones that I think if you watch them. Found in Ideology. Right,
01:47:05 because so much of the way I talk about shows is different from other critics
01:47:09 and it confuses a lot of people and so it's like if you watch these videos
01:47:12 you'll understand where I'm coming from and like art is all about pushing your
01:47:15 buttons is the first one in there because it's just to explain like look I'm not
01:47:19 always gonna talk about every element of every show. I'm gonna talk about the
01:47:23 interesting elements of every show that pushed my button like what stood out to
01:47:26 me because that's what makes the experience meaningful to me. Also we
01:47:31 have accepted mediocrity also an excellent video. That is a good one as well.
01:47:35 Tom where should they go for you? Just go to my Twitter I guess I mean that's where I'm just living right now.
01:47:40 At Tommy Oliver Says on Twitter you can play. You need it Tom. You gotta get your fucking website out so you can start killing people.
01:47:48 It's halfway done. I was working on it before. Obviously you can't have made any
01:47:52 progress on it while at Roundcon but it's just driving me crazy because I go to
01:47:56 your Twitter and it is a useless way to like get into you because you tweet way
01:48:01 more than just your own art. Yeah well yeah I have also made it into
01:48:06 Zoomy Twitter but I haven't done anything like that. It's like I get it Tom you support
01:48:09 Gamergate. I don't need to repeat it.
01:48:13 Hashtag not your shield. The fight continues. It's not over yet.
01:48:20 The Endless War Twitter and the Zoomy Twitter should like ERP.
01:48:24 Have you seen what I've been doing with the Endless War Twitter lately?
01:48:27 Yeah of course. It's just like key words Endless War, Slime, Retweet.
01:48:32 I just searched the word Slime. I just find like funny Slime posts on Twitter and just retweet all of them.
01:48:38 So Ben how about you?
01:48:41 I mean I guess I would say my comics at stcomics.com.
01:48:45 If it was a video I guess I would say depending on which way the wind blows for you either the
01:48:50 Sonichu lecture or the Nuzlocke one. Yeah the Nuzlocke.
01:48:55 It's probably starting with Genesis. I'll probably do another one at some point.
01:49:00 I don't know when but like oh I was thinking of doing one with Temtem.
01:49:05 I was thinking of Nuzlocke and Temtem. I don't know.
01:49:08 But it's like in beta pre-release right now. So I probably wouldn't do it until it's a season full release.
01:49:13 Do you want anyone to get into you at all? Do you want that?
01:49:16 Patreon.com slash Endless Jest of course right? Yeah.
01:49:19 I mean Patrons where everybody should go. Just give us money. We promise it's worth it.
01:49:24 Oh yeah Patreon.com slash Give and Take. Ben St.
01:49:28 I got 50 bonus podcasts. Patreon.com in general. Everyone know what Patreon is.
01:49:34 We literally all have Patreon. Everyone knows. Yes I don't.
01:49:39 He's got only fans though. I will after this.
01:49:44 Send me that link as soon as it's live.
01:49:48 AshleyMadison.com slash MunchieJ.
01:49:52 I don't want to tell my dad about this. Don't worry.
01:49:55 Check out my Seeking Arrangements page. Looking for a baby daddy type situation.
01:50:01 I'm the baby. No.
01:50:04 Well I mean we pretty much got through all the...
01:50:07 Wait I didn't answer.
01:50:09 What? You didn't answer?
01:50:12 I think we're pretty much done. I mean we could go on.
01:50:15 Are you done? They're not just you speak.
01:50:18 No. The best video to get into my stuff. I peaked very early with a video called Reapers.
01:50:25 Reapers. If you are into Mass Effect then yeah.
01:50:29 I'll tell you how you get into Jesse is you watch the fuck series.
01:50:35 Those are the most easy accessible videos.
01:50:37 Yeah I guess.
01:50:38 And they're all hilarious.
01:50:39 The way I got into Jesse was fuck cars.
01:50:42 And I need you to understand how young I am and how old you are.
01:50:46 When you made that video I watched it.
01:50:48 And then I showed it to all my friends at the library in sixth grade.
01:50:51 You know the funny thing about that video is when I watch it back.
01:50:55 It's like so obvious to me that first that I was just starting out and trying to figure out what my voice was.
01:51:01 And second that I had just started listening to a lot of Bill Burr.
01:51:04 Yes.
01:51:05 I'm just talking like Bill Burr in that video.
01:51:09 Yeah. It's very noticeable that you're really confident that you are like a Bill Burr AVGN.
01:51:14 Yeah.
01:51:15 That's me. The Bill Burr AVGN.
01:51:19 I mean if you're going to be something it's not a bad thing to be.
01:51:22 But other than that actually you know what? One video, the one video to get into endless stress I would pick sound criminals.
01:51:29 Yeah. Sound criminals and everyone loves unanimously.
01:51:35 Like the one video I've made that everyone unanimously enjoys is the autumn video.
01:51:40 Yeah.
01:51:41 Oh yeah.
01:51:42 People like really, people blow smoke up my ass about that autumn video all the time.
01:51:46 And so cool.
01:51:47 I guess that must be the one.
01:51:48 I don't like, honestly like everyone, it seems like a lot of time people talk about me and they're like, oh endless Jess.
01:51:55 Hoshu finale, meta stuff, standing in front of a bookcase angry yelling at the camera man.
01:52:04 It's like, dude like when he grew the neck beard.
01:52:06 Yeah.
01:52:07 Yeah.
01:52:08 When he grew the neck beard it really came into his own.
01:52:10 Yeah.
01:52:11 All that, but like this, I guess this is how I've evolved.
01:52:14 Like I hate all of that shit.
01:52:16 Embarrassed of all of it.
01:52:17 None of it matters to me.
01:52:19 The Crystal Empire video is still an old favorite.
01:52:22 The Colt Corona.
01:52:23 Oh yeah.
01:52:24 Colt Corona is gold.
01:52:25 I will never, I will never not love Colt Corona.
01:52:28 He's one of the best things that ever came out of me.
01:52:31 He is my son and I love him forever.
01:52:34 Him crawling out of that little baby castle.
01:52:36 Yeah.
01:52:37 Stuck with him so powerfully to this day.
01:52:39 Everything involving Colt Corona is gold and will always be.
01:52:42 It's true.
01:52:43 I think like my, but my favorite videos of mine.
01:52:46 I think it's possible.
01:52:48 I've never seen this.
01:52:49 Reasons I love auto videos.
01:52:50 You've never seen.
01:52:51 I saw it.
01:52:52 I don't remember it.
01:52:53 Yeah.
01:52:54 They were gross.
01:52:55 Oh yeah.
01:52:56 I have a like on it.
01:52:57 So clearly I did watch it.
01:52:58 I also really like the Arnold's Thanksgiving one that I did, but I don't think anyone fucking
01:53:02 gave a shit about that video.
01:53:04 I do remember that one, but I also remember the best Christmas episodes one, which also
01:53:12 the Hey Arnold holiday analysis, which is also great video.
01:53:16 I just as, as my tone evolved, like to the less like trying to be like hostile and cool
01:53:22 and like ego guy to the more like laid back stuff like the other, like that's the tone
01:53:26 that I like the most.
01:53:29 And the videos of mine that I like to watch back the most are like the not a reviews.
01:53:35 Yeah.
01:53:36 Those are all good because they're like, those are like the fucking not a review on which
01:53:39 in the hundred night is the only place where my opinions on me, Ponichi have been expressed
01:53:44 on the internet.
01:53:45 Well, those are like the most pure because like those are like deliberately the least
01:53:50 ego driven videos.
01:53:52 That was like kind of the point of them.
01:53:53 And that's kind of why they're called not a reviews because like I'm saying in the title,
01:53:57 you don't have to take this seriously.
01:53:59 This is not.
01:54:00 And so like, and saying that up front, freeze me to just goof off and say whatever dumb
01:54:05 shit I want and not have to act like it's important.
01:54:08 Not a review is such a good title because you immediately like give yourself a free
01:54:13 pass.
01:54:14 But you also get the search result of exact review.
01:54:19 Most of those videos are good.
01:54:20 And I like them.
01:54:21 And everything else I've ever done is shameful disgrace.
01:54:24 But we're not what you just said.
01:54:25 Are you saying that we've exited the hostile and cool faces just and they're the warm
01:54:30 and gay phase.
01:54:31 Warm and gay.
01:54:32 Warm and gay.
01:54:33 Warm and gay.
01:54:34 Warm and gay.
01:54:35 Warm and gay.
01:54:36 Is that a reference?
01:54:37 No.
01:54:38 No.
01:54:39 It's just.
01:54:40 It's just.
01:54:41 It's just pure organic.
01:54:42 It's just good.
01:54:43 I think we have one last question to exit on here guys.
01:54:47 It's how much capitalized do you guys love each other question mark question mark question
01:54:52 mark?
01:54:53 A lot.
01:54:54 A lot.
01:54:55 Hey, hey, everypony.
01:54:56 Welcome to the fucking sub dick show.
01:55:00 No one even fucking slightly cared about anything that just happened the past thursday.
01:55:06 No.
01:55:07 It's good.
01:55:08 Guys, I slept like three and a half hours last night.
01:55:09 My warm and fuzziness is at an all time low.
01:55:12 You just can't.
01:55:13 I cannot stand a single one of you.
01:55:14 Well, let's just address.
01:55:15 Oh, thank god.
01:55:16 The reason we do rad cons.
01:55:17 I don't know why.
01:55:18 We don't have a meetup so we could go to anymore because we all like being around each other
01:55:20 and just we all say it and then it just comes true that when we are together it's just a
01:55:25 way good time and it's just always nice to hang out so I'm real happy for it.
01:55:30 So somebody suggested Jay and I said, hey, why don't you guys all sing a song together?
01:55:34 Oh, I'm supposed to be working right now.
01:55:40 I'm supposed to be working right now.
01:55:45 But I'm not working.
01:55:47 I'm doing nothing.
01:55:50 Myself, I'm jerking.
01:55:52 Myself, I'm sucking.
01:55:55 I am an asshole.
01:55:57 I am a stupid.
01:55:59 I've got a deadline.
01:56:02 Don't want to do it.
01:56:05 Yeah.
01:56:06 What the hell is wrong with you?
01:56:09 Thank you.
01:56:10 Thanks everybody.
01:56:11 See you later.
01:56:12 See you in another 200 episodes.
