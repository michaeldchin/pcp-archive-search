00:00:00 Fuck me and my fucking asshole, what's up everybody, it's Riksy Minutes, I'm the best guy ever here with Digibro.
00:00:07 Hey, I'm still alive.
00:00:09 He sure are dude, so we just watched episode 5 of season 3, what was this one called? The Grand Adventure of Jerry and Rick?
00:00:17 The Whirly-Durly.
00:00:18 The Whirly-Durly.
00:00:19 Of course, of course, who could forget such a wonderful name.
00:00:22 Yeah, so this was way better than the last episode, right out of the gate, a thousand times better.
00:00:27 Oh yeah.
00:00:28 We got a lot of flack for not liking the previous episode.
00:00:32 We sure did.
00:00:33 It seemed like. Some people really enjoyed it.
00:00:35 And so many people were just like, guys, you fucking tools, obviously it was a Avengers reference, therefore all your criticisms don't make sense and are invalid.
00:00:45 Okay, literally what the fuck is the difference between an Avengers reference and a Guardians of the Galaxy reference?
00:00:53 Literally what? Because the Guardians of the Galaxy are a part of the Marvel Universe, they're another five person team, and they're in the fucking new Avengers movie!
00:01:05 So what the fuck is the difference?
00:01:07 I think what they were, it doesn't make any fucking difference, but to these incredibly pedantic people, it's that these guys form up as a team when called upon, like the Avengers do, they're not always a squad.
00:01:20 Who the fuck cares?
00:01:21 Yeah, I know.
00:01:22 It doesn't make any difference.
00:01:23 What the fuck effect does that have on the episode?
00:01:25 Zero. Zero.
00:01:26 It's nothing.
00:01:27 Which, and I know you haven't seen the Avengers either, have you?
00:01:30 No, I haven't.
00:01:31 Exactly.
00:01:32 So it doesn't fucking have affected anything.
00:01:35 I have, and I still, I don't give a, it makes no difference.
00:01:39 Well, it's just that thing.
00:01:40 Like we say something that's like, not even like wrong, but like slightly maybe a bit incorrect, and so that may, allows there to be a justification for why we're just totally invalid.
00:01:49 Our entire point of opinions can be thrown out at that point.
00:01:51 I don't even, I can't even like process the idea that it's less correct to say it's a Guardians of the Galaxy parody than it is a Avengers.
00:01:59 Yeah.
00:02:00 They're literally the same thing.
00:02:01 You got what?
00:02:02 But they're in space, yeah.
00:02:04 You got, like the dude who's like the human guy.
00:02:09 Uh-huh, yeah.
00:02:10 You could say he's Star-Lord.
00:02:11 You could say he's Tony Stark.
00:02:12 Either way, it makes just as much fucking sense.
00:02:15 Yep.
00:02:16 You're right, dude.
00:02:17 Is the pile of ants supposed to be the Hulk, or is he supposed to be-
00:02:22 Like Ultraliter, that other guy?
00:02:24 Vision?
00:02:25 No, Tree-B-Oh, Groot.
00:02:26 Groot.
00:02:27 Yeah, Groot.
00:02:28 Yeah, there you go.
00:02:29 I don't fucking know.
00:02:30 Is he supposed to be Groot, or is he supposed to be some of it?
00:02:31 It doesn't matter, because none of them are a direct parody.
00:02:34 That was my whole complaint.
00:02:36 Anyway, forget about that episode.
00:02:38 Yeah, that one doesn't matter.
00:02:39 Let's move on.
00:02:40 So-
00:02:41 This one's great.
00:02:42 Yeah, this episode was really great.
00:02:43 It was fucking great.
00:02:44 I loved it.
00:02:45 I'd say I loved it.
00:02:46 It was everything I wanted.
00:02:47 This felt like a season one episode to me.
00:02:49 Yeah.
00:02:50 It really took me back in a way.
00:02:52 In a way that I really wanted.
00:02:53 In a way that was good, refreshing.
00:02:55 Yeah, and some people were asking me, because they preview the shit out of the episodes
00:03:00 before they come out.
00:03:01 I ignore all that.
00:03:02 Because back in season two, I followed Rick and Morty on Facebook and shit.
00:03:07 And in season two, I was watching all the trailers beforehand and shit.
00:03:10 And all it did was make it so I wouldn't laugh at that joke when it happened in the episode.
00:03:16 Exactly.
00:03:17 You know?
00:03:18 Because I've heard it too recently or out of context.
00:03:21 And so it happened in the episode and I'd be like, oh, this is the part I saw in the
00:03:24 trailer, so I don't laugh at it.
00:03:25 The worst example of that was in season two and Morty turned into a car.
00:03:30 Oh, yeah.
00:03:31 They had already spoiled that.
00:03:32 And had I not known that, that shit would have blown my mind to fuck.
00:03:36 But I knew already.
00:03:37 So it wasn't that- there was no impact.
00:03:39 So I tried to ignore all that, but people bring it up in our comments anyways.
00:03:43 And people were asking me like, oh, are you worried?
00:03:45 They're bringing back Jerry next week.
00:03:47 But it was Jerry and Rick.
00:03:50 And that, as soon as I heard that, I was excited.
00:03:53 Because what I'm sick of with Jerry is him and Beth.
00:03:56 Oh, yeah.
00:03:57 That dynamic is played out.
00:03:58 Jerry and Rick, you can do anything with.
00:04:01 You know?
00:04:02 Yeah.
00:04:03 So I thought, oh, no, that sounds awesome.
00:04:04 Yeah, I'd love to see Jerry and Rick.
00:04:05 It's a great combo.
00:04:06 And it was.
00:04:07 And so it was.
00:04:08 It was a good combo.
00:04:09 It was great.
00:04:10 You know, just like bouncing.
00:04:11 Rick is just the guy with no filter who will just tell you what's up.
00:04:14 And, you know, we just really dive to the heart of Jerry's character here.
00:04:17 And, you know, there's that scene later on where he just, like, spells out exactly what kind
00:04:21 of a guy Jerry is.
00:04:22 And it was fucking devastating and fantastic.
00:04:25 And that's the kind of shit I love.
00:04:27 That scene was great because it put words to, like, what our problem with Jerry is.
00:04:36 It's everyone's problem with Jerry.
00:04:38 Everyone knows Jerry is shit.
00:04:39 But, like, sometimes, like I've seen in our comments, people being like, why are you
00:04:43 guys so harsh on Jerry?
00:04:45 What the fuck?
00:04:46 You know?
00:04:47 And we're like, well, that's the thing.
00:04:48 Like, Rick kind of spells it out right here that, yeah.
00:04:51 Like, Jerry himself is not a great guy.
00:04:56 And not just because he's an idiot, because he just manipulates people to get what he
00:05:01 wants.
00:05:02 He's constantly in this, oh, everyone beats up on me.
00:05:06 I'm the victim.
00:05:07 I'm the victim.
00:05:08 Even though he's the one who, like Rick said, it's his fault.
00:05:14 Beth's unhappy at this point.
00:05:16 I mean, it's both of their fault equally.
00:05:18 But, like, he wasn't a good husband for her.
00:05:21 So it's not like because she's breaking up with him, he's the victim here.
00:05:26 It's like, no, you were both bad for each other.
00:05:29 That's exactly right.
00:05:30 And you know what's fascinating about this to me?
00:05:32 It really reminds me sort of a dynamic of the worst kind of, like, YouTube commenter
00:05:38 versus, like, a YouTube creator, just as an example in my life.
00:05:41 Like, Rick is a guy who goes out and creates things.
00:05:44 You know, he doesn't need society to give him anything.
00:05:47 He creates value in his life and in those around him.
00:05:50 Jerry, on the other hand, is a parasite.
00:05:53 He's a little scum-sucking shit who can't do anything for himself.
00:05:56 He's like a YouTube commenter.
00:05:57 He's like a whiny, entitled YouTube commenter who just, you know, wants stuff,
00:06:01 give to him for free, and when he doesn't get exactly what he wants,
00:06:04 he'll bitch and cry and complain and pretend that he's been bullied in some way.
00:06:08 Not that I really have any experience with this, but just in my experience on YouTube,
00:06:11 like, you see that shit around.
00:06:13 Like, Jerry is the worst parts of humanity.
00:06:15 Like, the people that I want to all die.
00:06:17 And I only respect the people like Rick who just, they do things.
00:06:21 They create, they add value to the world so that the people like Jerry can live better lives.
00:06:26 But they don't deserve better lives.
00:06:28 They just happen to be there in the warm glow of the genius and the power
00:06:33 that is the Rick Sanchez's of the world.
00:06:35 I mean, someone like Jerry, he really preys on our humanity.
00:06:41 Oh, yeah.
00:06:42 Like, this is where...
00:06:43 He's a moral parasite. He's a moral parasite.
00:06:46 Sometimes when we look at Rick, like, there's clearly elements of Rick that are monstrous
00:06:50 and are not advised, that are not good for him or for anybody.
00:06:54 You know, like, this level of, like, detachment from emotion is not a good idea.
00:07:02 However, there are also elements of Rick that are there to protect us,
00:07:08 that we should incorporate into our lives.
00:07:10 Like, being able to, like, see through this kind of manipulation of someone like Jerry.
00:07:16 Because the average person, like, yeah, was gonna feel sorry for him.
00:07:20 And, like, that's how he'll fuck you.
00:07:22 You know?
00:07:23 That's how he'll...
00:07:24 I really love how he brings up specifically like Jerry.
00:07:27 Like, it's not like there are no victims.
00:07:29 You are the predator.
00:07:30 Beth was your prey.
00:07:31 You used your pathetic little, you know, whiny existence as a way to entrap Beth
00:07:37 to, like, suck the life out of her.
00:07:39 Who, you know, is a far more capable person than Jerry.
00:07:42 He's the parasite.
00:07:43 He is the bad guy here who just used this kind of emotional manipulation in his life
00:07:47 and does constantly that we see every fucking episode that he's in
00:07:50 to just, you know, be a baby, prey upon people's, like, desire to...
00:07:56 You know, like, even in this episode, like, he just fucking is so pathetic
00:07:59 that nobody feels like killing him.
00:08:01 They're just like, this is not worth my time.
00:08:03 It's not worth my time.
00:08:04 And that's what he does with Beth.
00:08:05 And, you know, it's great to just see it spelled out so black and white.
00:08:09 And you know what?
00:08:10 Just to get a little more...
00:08:12 Actually, you know what?
00:08:13 I don't want to say that.
00:08:14 Never mind.
00:08:15 Never mind.
00:08:16 Well, to go further into the episode, there's an opportunity here
00:08:21 because I've been complaining about how I wanted Jerry to just be out of the show.
00:08:25 But I do think there's ways to use him.
00:08:27 Like, the reason I wanted him out, I wanted him out exactly this way
00:08:30 where he's just not in the house having the same bee plots he's had before.
00:08:34 We just don't want the same story again and again.
00:08:36 And this isn't the same story.
00:08:37 This is new ground.
00:08:38 But there's a huge opportunity at the end of this episode
00:08:41 where Jerry seems to kind of learn from what Rick accused him of
00:08:46 and the fucking other dude.
00:08:48 You know, like Jerry gets his shit rocked emotionally
00:08:52 and he actually seems to reflect on it a little.
00:08:54 And it seems like throughout the season, Jerry has kind of been like
00:08:59 taking in the criticisms people have had of him.
00:09:02 You know, like as it's gone on, he's kind of reflected.
00:09:05 And I'm wondering, what if Jerry actually, actually develops as a character?
00:09:10 You know dude, it reminds me of when I was a young lad
00:09:13 and not doing a lot with my life before I had my shit together.
00:09:16 Like my parents would just bring up occasionally how they needed to throw me out.
00:09:20 Not that they would, but like they're just like,
00:09:22 Nate, you're living here, you're just being a bum.
00:09:24 What are you fucking doing with your life?
00:09:25 And that was entirely fair.
00:09:26 And like throwing me out would have been a fine and reasonable thing to do.
00:09:30 And that's kind of exactly what happened to Jerry.
00:09:32 You know, you got to fucking nut up in a situation like that
00:09:35 and face your shit and recognize that like he's just being placated
00:09:39 by continuing to live with Beth and like continuing to receive,
00:09:42 to continue to suck on the teat of sweet life
00:09:46 that comes from these better people in his life.
00:09:48 I actually know a guy, now that I'm like thinking about it
00:09:53 and hearing it like through this episode I'm realizing
00:09:56 I know a guy who's just like Jerry, who has a victim complex.
00:10:00 He's constantly blaming the circumstances surrounding him
00:10:03 and other people being an asshole.
00:10:05 But he himself is a vindictus shit who like the second,
00:10:09 the second he has the power and situation he takes advantage of it.
00:10:13 Just like Jerry does this episode where when Rick's retarded
00:10:15 Jerry's just beating up on him ruthlessly
00:10:17 even though he would never, you know, at all other times
00:10:21 he's crying victim because of Rick's actions.
00:10:25 I knew a guy exactly like that
00:10:27 and he got kicked out of my group of friends for being that way.
00:10:31 He pissed off everyone I knew so many times
00:10:35 that we eventually just had to say you can't come here anymore.
00:10:39 Like just like Jerry.
00:10:41 So it's kind of the inevitability with someone like this
00:10:44 because they are so sure that everyone else is the asshole
00:10:49 that they will never process the fact that they are the real asshole.
00:10:54 That's exactly right.
00:10:56 And the best you can hope for in a situation like that
00:10:58 I think is that like you kick this person out
00:11:01 they finally have to face the real consequences of their lifestyle
00:11:04 and their attitude and actions
00:11:06 and like hopefully they'll become a better person
00:11:08 and then like get a decent group of friends elsewhere
00:11:11 or like maybe get a family that like they've actually
00:11:13 formed a real bond of respect with.
00:11:15 And you know what, maybe years later
00:11:17 they'll be, once they become a good person
00:11:19 they'll be able to come back and be like, hey man, you know,
00:11:21 hey ain't seeing a while, you know, I'm not a pathetic piece of shit anymore
00:11:24 I really became a good person, yeah I'm doing my own thing now
00:11:26 don't need to, you know, drag everybody else around down with me
00:11:29 I've got this other thing that I've developed in my own life
00:11:31 you know, my own situation, my own friends, my own circle
00:11:34 that I built up with actual positive character traits
00:11:38 and then you can have that kind of relationship later on, you know
00:11:42 but I love, I love it
00:11:45 when people have to face their shit
00:11:47 that's fucked up about themselves personally
00:11:49 and get over it and yeah, it's what this episode was
00:11:52 and it was fucking great.
00:11:53 I love that the scene of Rick hammering Jerry with all of that
00:11:58 is immediately followed by a scene
00:12:00 of Jerry being repeatedly slapped in the face
00:12:02 by the testicles of a monster that he's riding in the sack of.
00:12:06 Yeah, that was fucking great.
00:12:08 That's what I love about Rick and Morty
00:12:11 that's the kind, that's the Rick and Morty I want
00:12:13 I can deal with all the clever, the clever bickering or whatever
00:12:18 you know, like the last episode I was complaining
00:12:20 that too much of it was like the snarky back and forth
00:12:22 the Rick and Morty stuff that makes me bust out laughing
00:12:26 is when they hit you with some, some deep real shit
00:12:29 and then follow it up with a amazingly timed dick joke, you know
00:12:34 The show really needs to keep that going
00:12:36 if it doesn't, like yeah, it starts to feel like
00:12:39 like a Marvel movie I guess
00:12:41 which I don't want, which I do not want
00:12:43 this, yeah, I want to keep that raw shit
00:12:46 keep it flowing guys
00:12:48 Yeah, it was fucking good, not to mention the fact that
00:12:50 during that scene where Jerry's just being
00:12:53 emotionally devastated by Rick
00:12:55 and he's crying, he's just like literally being
00:12:57 eaten and devoured by a monster and is fucking dying
00:13:00 That's great, you know, you gotta die
00:13:03 and you gotta deal with your shit to become a real boy, Jerry
00:13:07 Oh, it was good, hey, but you know
00:13:09 there was a bunch of other cool stuff in this episode
00:13:11 How about that immortality field?
00:13:13 That was pretty fucking dope.
00:13:14 Yeah, cool idea
00:13:16 There's a, there's a manga that is kind of all about this
00:13:20 like exploring this idea
00:13:22 There's a manga called Immortal Hounds
00:13:24 which takes place in a world where
00:13:26 there's like a society where no one can die
00:13:29 and like people who can die can, because of like a disease
00:13:33 So like the police are just hunting those people down with impunity
00:13:36 because like they don't want to spread the disease
00:13:38 of being able to die
00:13:40 So if you can die and they can just shoot anybody
00:13:43 it doesn't matter, because if you're immortal
00:13:45 you'll come back to life
00:13:46 and if you die, oh well that guy had the disease
00:13:48 so fuck him, you know
00:13:50 So it's just like constant violence
00:13:52 and people shooting each other
00:13:54 and the thing is that in Immortal Hounds
00:13:56 it's not that you heal instantly like you do in this
00:13:59 it's that when you die you heal
00:14:02 So if you say lose your arms
00:14:04 then you'll just be without arms
00:14:06 until you bleed out and die and then you come back
00:14:09 So it does a lot of interesting things with that
00:14:11 This is a less interesting usage of the concept than that
00:14:13 but that's also in that case
00:14:15 it's the entire series about that
00:14:17 Yeah right, the fact that you can insert that into one episode
00:14:20 as like a set piece is great
00:14:22 and it's really cool and yeah
00:14:24 it's used to what little, you know
00:14:26 like the effect that they could cram into this episode
00:14:28 I think my favorite part of the whole episode
00:14:30 that wasn't directly related to Jerry's whole shit
00:14:33 was just at the end after like, you know
00:14:35 the shit goes down and the immortality field goes away
00:14:37 and the little kid who had been murdering his sister for fun
00:14:40 over and over shoots her again and he's just like
00:14:42 Liz? She's fucking dead
00:14:44 and the thing about that scene
00:14:46 that scene is close to
00:14:49 this show, I've said this before
00:14:51 this show is always writing on this line
00:14:53 between like just glib violence
00:14:56 that I would find disgusting
00:14:58 and violence that's fun and breezy
00:15:01 and this is like right on the line but I think it's fun and breezy
00:15:03 whereas in the last episode the one guy getting horribly fucking
00:15:06 murdered for no reason was just kind of gross
00:15:09 and it was like why? Why did we need this?
00:15:11 Like what did he do that was so obnoxious
00:15:13 that he deserved to die so
00:15:15 bizarrely? In this episode
00:15:17 it's just some minor little background character
00:15:19 but the fact that earlier in the episode
00:15:21 Jerry had said that's just bad parenting
00:15:23 either way
00:15:25 that makes it hilarious that it happens
00:15:27 That's exactly right and beyond hilarious
00:15:29 it's actually kind of making a point
00:15:31 that I actually like a lot
00:15:33 it's like yeah don't live in a fucking fan still world
00:15:35 like Jerry's just like this is
00:15:37 the fact that Jerry immediately recognized
00:15:39 that this is like stupid and irresponsible
00:15:41 and was 100% right
00:15:43 yeah it's good you know he's got a little bit of wisdom in him
00:15:45 he's not a total fucking idiot
00:15:47 it's good that was really good
00:15:49 yeah it was a good moment
00:15:51 Kill more children Rick and Morty
00:15:53 we gotta yeah and it's
00:15:55 you know they managed to make
00:15:57 horribly murdering a child funny
00:15:59 yeah
00:16:01 um
00:16:03 what
00:16:05 I'm trying to think of
00:16:07 I'm trying to think of anything other than
00:16:09 the crazy trippy scene to talk about
00:16:11 but we have to address it because it's just
00:16:13 this episode they go through
00:16:15 a wormhole and just there's
00:16:17 this total mind fuck scene where they get
00:16:19 like mind melded for an epoch
00:16:21 or something but it's a fleeting
00:16:23 high so it's like waking up
00:16:25 because I know this feel
00:16:27 of like I've had those dreams
00:16:29 that last like days
00:16:31 and it's like you've lived this other life
00:16:33 and then you wake up and for like
00:16:35 five minutes
00:16:37 you feel like this incredible
00:16:39 dysphoria between like your mind
00:16:41 and body having like having to remember
00:16:43 who you actually are
00:16:45 and like where you really are
00:16:47 but then it just goes away and you forget about the dream
00:16:49 and it doesn't matter anymore and like
00:16:51 that was this moment of
00:16:53 I have um
00:16:55 something I've always been really interested in
00:16:57 is like these kinds of time accelerations
00:16:59 like people who've experienced
00:17:01 an incredible amount of time would have such
00:17:03 a different perspective on
00:17:05 everything you know so like
00:17:07 in that moment after it
00:17:09 happened they have such this incredible
00:17:11 understanding of one another
00:17:13 that could have been I mean
00:17:15 that was a whole epoch of experience
00:17:17 of them being a completely different person
00:17:19 but they forget about it so quickly
00:17:21 that it already doesn't matter
00:17:23 you know they lived
00:17:25 an infinite number of other seasons
00:17:27 of Rick and Morty that we'll never see
00:17:29 that's an excellent way to put it
00:17:31 in which Rick and Jerry
00:17:33 have a great relationship
00:17:35 doing weird trippy shit
00:17:37 like fucking and also turning into
00:17:39 animals and killing each other
00:17:41 and evolving and shit
00:17:43 and then at the end he's like
00:17:45 already he just doesn't give a fuck
00:17:47 after like one second that's fucking hilarious
00:17:49 that's great
00:17:51 that's the great juxtaposition there
00:17:53 of this shit happening and them just not giving a fuck
00:17:55 like that's like the good kind of nihilistic
00:17:57 stuff this does
00:17:59 it's like a fucking funny joke
00:18:01 that makes me laugh and go ha ha
00:18:03 that's good that's the good shit
00:18:05 while also being
00:18:07 while also not only being
00:18:09 a like high level concept
00:18:11 but also one that you can understand
00:18:13 in one sentence
00:18:15 like Rick explains he just says
00:18:17 whatever it's called
00:18:19 is a more fleeting high
00:18:21 salvia you know like
00:18:23 immediately we get why they're coming
00:18:25 down like what just happened
00:18:27 and why it's not affecting them anymore
00:18:29 is all set in a couple lines
00:18:31 while you're imagining this much bigger
00:18:33 concept that they've actually explored
00:18:35 that's classic that's what I love about Rick and Morty
00:18:37 that's like my favorite thing about the show
00:18:39 is that
00:18:41 and
00:18:43 then also one of my favorite scenes
00:18:45 is so we've got a B-plot in this episode
00:18:47 about Summer accidentally turning herself
00:18:49 giant
00:18:51 it's definitely the less interesting
00:18:53 part of the episode but I'm okay with that
00:18:55 I'm okay with B-plots in general
00:18:57 I think it makes sense when you're trying to
00:18:59 split up a story
00:19:01 and have more than one thing going on
00:19:03 and we get this fucking hilarious moment
00:19:05 when Beth turns herself giant
00:19:07 and it's talking to Summer
00:19:09 and you can't understand what either of them
00:19:11 are saying like they're having this big
00:19:13 emotional moment but it's just
00:19:15 like
00:19:17 that was fucking hilarious
00:19:19 by the way do you think this was an attack
00:19:21 on Titan reference
00:19:23 it just kind of looked like it
00:19:25 I know it's kind of recent
00:19:27 I didn't even think about it
00:19:29 could be for all I know
00:19:31 what do you think of Morty vindictively
00:19:33 fucking over
00:19:35 the guy who
00:19:37 for hurting his sister's feelings
00:19:39 I enjoyed
00:19:41 seeing Morty in that role
00:19:43 of like the like it makes sense
00:19:45 that like this guy is seeing the shit now
00:19:47 like he's in a place where he can easily
00:19:49 do this kind of stuff when he wants to
00:19:51 just like threaten people and
00:19:53 do you think Morty will eventually become
00:19:55 Rick
00:19:57 that's kind of what seems to be implied
00:19:59 sort of
00:20:01 in season two we were constantly given
00:20:03 in fact ever since season one there's been this idea
00:20:05 that he is the good Morty
00:20:07 he's the smarter Morty than
00:20:09 the other Mortys
00:20:11 in season two he always has
00:20:13 these moments where like he tries to be
00:20:15 like more Rick like but he's
00:20:17 still so stupid that he gets himself
00:20:19 fucked over anyways but now in season
00:20:21 three sometimes
00:20:23 Morty doesn't fuck up
00:20:25 this episode Morty had all the power
00:20:27 Morty tricked Rick
00:20:29 into going on this adventure
00:20:31 so he could get rid of Rick
00:20:33 like Rick the concept
00:20:35 of this episode is Rick thinks he's
00:20:37 taking he thinks Morty is so worried
00:20:39 about Jerry so he takes
00:20:41 Jerry on a fake adventure to placate
00:20:43 Morty but Morty is actually
00:20:45 just wanted to break from
00:20:47 hanging out with Rick and so tricked
00:20:49 him into taking his dad
00:20:51 instead yeah Morty doesn't give a fuck
00:20:53 about Jerry he doesn't give a fuck
00:20:55 about Rick he just wanted Rick out of
00:20:57 his hair and then he's mad
00:20:59 and you know and he's
00:21:01 smarter than his mom in the situation they get into
00:21:03 you know he's the voice of reason there
00:21:05 and I'm just like Morty was completely on
00:21:07 top of his game this episode what the fuck
00:21:09 you know he's really getting his shit together
00:21:11 yeah there's no doubt about it
00:21:13 yeah it's an interesting idea
00:21:15 I've never been sure if I wanted
00:21:17 that but now if it's
00:21:19 like this I kind of do
00:21:21 well you know I was thinking so we've seen
00:21:23 all these multi-verse versions of Morty
00:21:25 but have we ever seen like older Morty
00:21:27 like what he'll be like as an adult no
00:21:29 I don't think we've ever explored that
00:21:31 we've never really got into like
00:21:33 future or past of the
00:21:35 lines of the characters which is probably smart
00:21:37 in terms of wanting to be able to keep writing
00:21:39 the story without fucking up too bad
00:21:41 like all the different ricks
00:21:43 the different dimensional ricks are always
00:21:45 an old man you know yeah by the way
00:21:47 quick aside so in this episode
00:21:49 we learned that Rick's got
00:21:51 a ton of cybernetic enhancements
00:21:53 all over his body and that's really
00:21:55 cool and I like that
00:21:57 it's interesting but
00:21:59 it's kind of weird that that hasn't
00:22:01 ever come up before and it strikes me
00:22:03 as like okay he's been
00:22:05 in a lot of situations where it'd be really
00:22:07 useful to have used those and he just never
00:22:09 did so it's it feels to me like
00:22:11 someone just wrote that in this episode like
00:22:13 they thought it would be cool well when we finally
00:22:15 see him use one he like
00:22:17 opens up this massive gun
00:22:19 to shoot a suction cup at
00:22:21 somebody so I think maybe they're all just
00:22:23 weird stupid prank
00:22:25 well he does that but then he also
00:22:27 blasts the guys head off like with the same gun
00:22:29 but yeah it also had like the suction cup thing
00:22:31 um yeah
00:22:33 I don't care at all it was cool but
00:22:35 yeah it doesn't matter
00:22:37 my favorite joke
00:22:39 in this episode is
00:22:41 Placated Rick
00:22:43 like the fact that
00:22:45 the idea that
00:22:47 in order to prevent
00:22:49 international terrorism when you get on a plane
00:22:51 they just inject you with something that makes you
00:22:53 a fucking retard
00:22:55 with no controversial opinions
00:22:57 or intelligence
00:22:59 and that and that they did this
00:23:01 to Rick like he was not prepared for it
00:23:03 and now he's just completely helpless
00:23:05 and he's talking like a baby
00:23:07 and it's fucking hilarious like Jerry beating
00:23:09 up on him while he was retarded was the funniest
00:23:11 shit in the world to me yeah that was
00:23:13 good that was good shit
00:23:15 um well
00:23:17 fuck anything else I mean we
00:23:19 oh you know what one other aspect of this episode
00:23:21 is like
00:23:23 Beth's just like need to like
00:23:25 be in charge of shit like she's doing this
00:23:27 weird you know what she's doing her weird like
00:23:29 hoover like lull epic joke guys
00:23:31 um but then like this is a bizarre one
00:23:33 yeah I thought it was
00:23:35 kind of cool but then like so there's the whole thing
00:23:37 that she's kind of like vying with Morty about
00:23:39 how like she needs to like be able to solve
00:23:41 these issues without her dad
00:23:43 and it seems like it all really just stems from
00:23:45 the need to like like Morty sums it up later
00:23:47 on the episode like yeah like just stop
00:23:49 stop sucking up to your dad like stop trying to
00:23:51 just like make his life great and be super
00:23:53 you know
00:23:55 and whatever like conciliatory to whatever
00:23:57 he fucking needs
00:23:59 I feel like uh what's great about this
00:24:01 situation with Beth is that now with Jerry
00:24:03 out of the picture we're getting to look at
00:24:05 the fact that Jerry wasn't all her
00:24:07 problems yeah you know like
00:24:09 up until this point it's been
00:24:11 like all of the bad things like
00:24:13 all of her emotional issues have been blamed on Jerry
00:24:15 and now that we see that with him out of the picture
00:24:17 she doesn't just immediately thrive
00:24:19 yeah she's not suddenly like a badass
00:24:21 who gets to do anything she's just
00:24:23 horribly emotionally damaged
00:24:25 weirdo who
00:24:27 you know like instead of going
00:24:29 and doing something scientific with her time
00:24:31 is like building a hoof statue
00:24:33 it's like what she's
00:24:35 she's broken you know which is interesting
00:24:37 uh uh because you know
00:24:39 Rick brings up you know when he when having the big
00:24:41 fight with him and Jerry uh how
00:24:43 how Jerry ruined this
00:24:45 his daughter you know like this is Rick
00:24:47 Sanchez's daughter she could have done fucking
00:24:49 anything and instead like he knocked her up
00:24:51 this fucking piece of shit
00:24:53 worm loser whose only skill
00:24:55 in life is making people pity him
00:24:57 which I'm sure is just the worst thing
00:24:59 Rick could like possibly have to deal with
00:25:01 um oh god
00:25:03 the fact I'm just thinking of like if my
00:25:05 daughter married a guy like Jerry
00:25:07 like Jesus Christ that would be
00:25:09 the fucking where I would want to murder him
00:25:11 I would want to murder that man it would be
00:25:13 a nightmare but it's also partly Rick's fault
00:25:15 because he wasn't around that's very true
00:25:17 that's a very good point like
00:25:19 that's the one who created the emotional vulnerability
00:25:21 that probably left her open to just like
00:25:23 fucking around with this kid and she was
00:25:25 a little baby yeah so uh
00:25:27 that sucks though you know I do wonder
00:25:29 did she you know the
00:25:31 the fact that you brought up before like the fact that Jerry
00:25:33 disappears and it doesn't immediately solve all our
00:25:35 problems did she does she really have
00:25:37 like that much going on for herself
00:25:39 like I know she's Rick's daughter but it's
00:25:41 not like she's some kind of super genius
00:25:43 in her own right you know
00:25:45 maybe that's Rick she's been a little yeah
00:25:47 that's him being a dad you know just being a straight
00:25:49 up dad there
00:25:51 I don't know something to think about I'm
00:25:53 going to be keeping that in mind and like see if
00:25:55 she shows burgeoning potential of
00:25:57 I don't know magic science powers
00:25:59 or something I guess I don't know
00:26:01 yeah
00:26:03 well that's uh that's all I've got to
00:26:05 say about this episode really strong
00:26:07 you know not not as like
00:26:09 it's not one of those like brick
00:26:11 shitting incredible episodes that like
00:26:13 is just so perfectly crafted
00:26:15 like episode one yeah
00:26:17 or something or or one that's
00:26:19 like super unique like pickle Rick like
00:26:21 this is very this is like standard
00:26:23 Rick and Morty in a good way
00:26:25 the last episode was like if you took
00:26:27 just like the
00:26:29 like the bog standard of the show
00:26:31 but like below like without actually
00:26:33 having anything that stands out
00:26:35 this is an episode that's like as good as what
00:26:37 should be the average for this
00:26:39 show I completely agree that's a good way
00:26:41 of putting it I should be like this should be
00:26:43 the minimum and above and beyond
00:26:45 should be the maximum I
00:26:47 very much agree I'd give it like a strong
00:26:49 eight or something like that
00:26:51 yeah agree all right
00:26:53 well that's it everybody thanks for listening
00:26:55 rikstymids back next week
00:26:57 hey I don't give a fuck bitch
00:26:59 I don't care about anything
00:27:01 bye bye
