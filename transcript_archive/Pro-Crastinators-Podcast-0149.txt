00:00:00 Hello everybody and welcome to another explosive Diarrhea episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:20 We're Diarrhea coming out of my mouth right now.
00:00:23 I feel like shit. I'm Tom Oliver and today I'm introducing this band of rascals with me, starting with my good boy Digibro.
00:00:34 Just slammed six fucking spicy octopus dumplings down the gullet and I'm fucking ready to go.
00:00:40 Oh god, that's gonna be real Diarrhea soon. Endless Jess is here.
00:00:43 I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know everything that shines ain't always gonna be good. Everybody sing along, I'll be good.
00:00:55 Best of luck to you my boy. Mage is here.
00:01:00 How do you draw snakes? I forget.
00:01:04 There's like squiggly lines and then put a little like V-tongue on the end of them.
00:01:09 Oh no, I know a little friend. I love snakes.
00:01:13 Speaking of snakes, Nate is here.
00:01:17 Oh god, is it them snakes? Is he back with another fire track?
00:01:22 Speaking of them snakes, we have the poor the poor man's substitute for them snakes.
00:01:27 Benzane. Ray Misato, Arigato, kakakakawaii.
00:01:34 Wait a minute, did she say Ray and Misato as an Evangelion?
00:01:38 That was a substitution of my own because I don't know the actual words.
00:01:42 Well, it was good. Thanks. I thought I thought it through really carefully.
00:01:45 One minute in and I don't know what you're talking about already.
00:01:48 It's like an Avril Lavigne, the Hello Kitty song. You're one of the greatest artists of the 20th century.
00:01:53 This is real. I stayed away from that.
00:01:56 It came out about like 10 years ago or something, but yeah, she made a mainstream for me.
00:02:00 People got a little mad at her for some cultural appropriation, you know, obvious bullshit.
00:02:04 Nate and Ben, are you aware that Avril Lavigne did two songs for the ending of a one piece movie?
00:02:12 Yes. And one of them is a Nickelback cover.
00:02:16 What? Okay, I wasn't aware of that.
00:02:18 It's like it's like an acoustic folk Nickelback cover as the ending theme of a one piece movie
00:02:25 performed by Avril Lavigne.
00:02:27 Everything you just said, she was she was she was married to the Nickelback guy.
00:02:31 Oda did draw Avril Lavigne in one piece style because of their like buddy friendship or whatever.
00:02:37 That's awesome. I mean, I think she just came out with a new album.
00:02:40 Holy shit.
00:02:43 Unless I'm mistaken. I think pretty sure I heard that on the grapevine.
00:02:47 My whole word.
00:02:48 Here it is. Oh my gosh.
00:02:49 Look at this shit. I gotta see this. Please.
00:02:51 Okay. Cabin, it'll be in the show notes, obviously, or whatever.
00:02:54 Avril's back.
00:02:56 I always knew she would be.
00:02:58 Look at Avril Lavigne drawn by Oda.
00:03:00 He did this because they're because he's a fan or something.
00:03:04 Bizarre.
00:03:05 It looks good though, right? I think so.
00:03:08 I mean, in as much as Oda's drawings of women can look good, it looks fine.
00:03:13 They, well, that's silly things to say.
00:03:15 Ooh. One, doesn't look particularly like Avril.
00:03:20 Two, not Oda's best face.
00:03:25 Maybe it wasn't literally one. It probably was.
00:03:28 Yeah, it's close. It's fine. Yeah, it'll do.
00:03:32 I'll take it.
00:03:34 Thanks Oda.
00:03:34 I haven't watched any of the new movies.
00:03:35 Oh, I'll leave it.
00:03:37 Oh, I'll leave it.
00:03:38 Destroy it.
00:03:38 So what else is going on, people?
00:03:40 Who's got things on the table?
00:03:41 Well, hey, you know what I had, you know what it did yesterday?
00:03:44 Yeah.
00:03:45 Had fucking RFCKCon2.
00:03:47 Rowdyfuckers con killers.
00:03:50 Did you even know that was going on until I saw the live streams on my feed?
00:03:53 Yep.
00:03:54 Yep. The bunch of killers, bunch of Rowdy showed out in Boston.
00:04:00 We met up at Faniel Hall.
00:04:01 We had some IRL gang violence where they split up into teams
00:04:05 and they had to go around and shoot each other in real life.
00:04:08 I heard that someone won, that there was a winner.
00:04:10 How was that decided?
00:04:12 Okay, okay. So I came up with this game.
00:04:14 I actually came up with it a long time ago, but this was the first time.
00:04:18 It was called Endless War.
00:04:20 No.
00:04:21 Yes.
00:04:21 This was the first time we had the chance to do it.
00:04:24 Okay, so we split up into teams.
00:04:25 Luckily, we had four killers and four Rowdies, and so it worked out perfectly.
00:04:29 And basically, we defined a perimeter and we were like, okay,
00:04:33 I'm going to give the abbreviated version.
00:04:34 Basically, it's like, within the zone, you have your camera.
00:04:38 You have to run around and look for enemies and take pictures of them,
00:04:42 and then post the picture of them in a certain channel in a certain discord
00:04:45 we set up for it, and that's a shot and that kills them.
00:04:49 And basically, it's like a quick draw.
00:04:51 So if two people see each other, it's like, who can take a picture and post it first,
00:04:54 and they get the shot off first, and they win, and the other one's dead.
00:04:57 Fascinating.
00:04:58 And it was a shootout, and Connor, Connor the Rowdy, did win, but it was close.
00:05:03 It came down to Connor versus Shraft?
00:05:07 Or Sauce?
00:05:08 Not Sauce, but it was, yeah, but yes.
00:05:11 The Rowdies won by a hair, and I will kill them.
00:05:16 Well, that's pretty cool.
00:05:17 And it was a hoot.
00:05:17 It's a dope system.
00:05:18 And then we went and we live-streamed Kazi's dad's house, and that was RSCKCon,
00:05:24 and it took all day, and it was really fun.
00:05:27 Are people still traveling in for these, or is this just people who are in Boston at this point?
00:05:33 It was about half and half.
00:05:36 It really terrifies me.
00:05:37 You are in control of a cult, and you really should be leading into it a lot more.
00:05:42 Um, there was, um, Kip was there, he's from Texas, uh, I think Texas.
00:05:50 Fucking Texas!
00:05:51 Sauce Pirate was from New York.
00:05:53 How are they affording to fly in for these?
00:05:56 How are they affording to fly in for these?
00:05:58 They've been saving up their good boy points for years at this point.
00:06:00 Well, they've been mining in the mines.
00:06:03 They've built up a bunch of slime coin, you know, before they-
00:06:06 Some of them still have some left over from the great slime coin market boom.
00:06:11 Of the pre-Negapause days, you know, that went a long way.
00:06:15 Okay, so what I've been doing for the last few days
00:06:19 is I've been, like, marathoning this podcast, called Who Are These Podcasts,
00:06:23 that is a podcast that reviews other podcasts, mostly to shit on them, and-
00:06:29 Can we get on there?
00:06:31 Probably, but, uh, it's- because I've been listening to it, it's, you know,
00:06:37 put a lot of things in my head about, like, what a podcast should or shouldn't be like.
00:06:41 And so I'm just, like, analyzing our podcast as we're doing it, and all I can think is,
00:06:46 this is the least comprehensible fucking podcast ever.
00:06:49 Sure.
00:06:50 Like, we've gone for seven and a half minutes, and nothing we've talked about is something that
00:06:55 anyone could possibly know what the fuck we're talking about.
00:06:59 Like, like, aside from, like, Avril Lavigne-
00:07:01 The endless war fanbase would beg to differ.
00:07:04 Avril Lavigne be in a one piece-
00:07:06 Marathoning at the mouth.
00:07:07 Like, I'm thinking, if you don't know anime, you don't know what we're talking about,
00:07:12 why it's interesting that Avril is in a one piece thing, and we even, like, we say Oda,
00:07:17 we're talking about the author of one piece, but we don't say that.
00:07:21 Who wouldn't know that?
00:07:24 The most-
00:07:24 Who in this wide world?
00:07:26 And then, like-
00:07:26 Well, I mean, as you- I mean, we are- we are the premiere anime podcast on-
00:07:30 It's true.
00:07:30 The internet, so everyone should be telling you-
00:07:32 I'm not- I'm not even complaining.
00:07:34 I'm just saying that, like, uh, it's just occurring to me.
00:07:37 We're doing everything wrong from a marketing perspective.
00:07:40 Absolutely true.
00:07:41 Tell me more, Digi.
00:07:41 I'm actually very interested, and this is a great line of inquiry,
00:07:44 and I'm interested to hear any thoughts you have on this subject,
00:07:47 because I think about this all the time.
00:07:48 Okay.
00:07:50 Um, was that it?
00:07:51 What- what-
00:07:51 Would you mean the quality of the podcast or something?
00:07:52 Yeah.
00:07:53 Yeah.
00:07:53 Oh.
00:07:54 Yeah, sure, sure.
00:07:55 Let's talk about what a- what a bizarre clusterfuck the PCP is.
00:07:58 The PCP is-
00:07:59 Sure.
00:07:59 It's- it's extremely bizarre, for sure, and definitely a huge clusterfuck, but, like,
00:08:05 at the same time, that is the only reason anyone cares, I think.
00:08:09 Like, it's- it's a podcast who- which only exists to serve the audience it already has.
00:08:16 It's a show about nothing.
00:08:18 Pretty much.
00:08:19 It's- it's a show about, like, just-
00:08:22 It's just us, just the people who are members,
00:08:24 smash together once a week to talk about whatever.
00:08:27 But, like, because of the fact that we- we take it for granted that the audience is,
00:08:32 you know, following- it's really funny, especially because, like, a lot of our audience
00:08:36 doesn't follow all of us, like, individually or really know anything about, like,
00:08:42 there are some people who listen to PCP and it's, like, they're just a fan of, say, Nate,
00:08:45 who listens to this and thinks of it as this podcast, Nate's On,
00:08:49 and then has no idea who the rest of us are.
00:08:51 Ah, yes, the capricious Nate heads.
00:08:53 Fucking Roseboys.
00:08:56 I just have to wonder what it even- what it sounds like we're talking about to- to anyone like that,
00:09:01 you know? Like, what do- do they just listen and they're like,
00:09:05 I have no idea what's going on?
00:09:06 You know, one of our- one of our longtime fans, Oblivion Fall,
00:09:10 of great professionalism and renown, um, he, uh, he described the other day.
00:09:14 This wasn't about, like, the quality or anything.
00:09:16 He's obviously followed all of us for the- most of us, anyway, for a long time.
00:09:20 But he said that, like, the PCP was his- someone said I- like, someone submitted an entrance for the,
00:09:26 for the theme contest and they said, like, uh, you know,
00:09:30 lol, I procrastinated on this.
00:09:32 Does that mean I get bonus points?
00:09:33 And then Oblivion Fall, I think, replied, said something like,
00:09:35 actually, I find the procrastinator's podcast, like,
00:09:38 the most beneficial thing for me to enhance my productivity.
00:09:42 Something about it, he finds very conducive to doing his work.
00:09:46 I don't know what that is.
00:09:47 I think on a recent episode, we addressed the- the irony of the fact that none of us are really major
00:09:52 procrastinators.
00:09:54 Like, well, you know, it's one of those things- it's one of those things that's like,
00:09:59 when you have a- when you have a astrological sign, like, I'm a cancer,
00:10:03 you can go searching for the ways that that actually does, you know, pin- it's the religious
00:10:08 mindset.
00:10:08 You find ways to, like, justify beliefs you already have.
00:10:11 I mean, we all do that about everything.
00:10:13 But, like, because of procrastinator, I mean, I do procrastinate on quite a bit,
00:10:16 so I'm like, yeah, that totally works.
00:10:18 I'm thinking of confirmation bias, all the ways I totally do procrastinate in a week.
00:10:22 But I mean, everyone procrastinates to one degree to one degree to another.
00:10:27 I think it's- it's a weird word, though, because, like, when you think about procrastination,
00:10:31 like, I put things off to the last minute, but not because I'm not doing anything.
00:10:36 It's like, I will find- if I know that there's a deadline, I would rather do it
00:10:42 right before the deadline and then cram in other shit to do before that.
00:10:47 And I don't really know why I operate that way, but, like- but I've never passed the deadline.
00:10:52 Like, I've always managed this very well.
00:10:55 I've never been late on these kinds of things.
00:10:57 So, it's funny, like, when I think of- when most people say that they procrastinate,
00:11:02 I think they are talking about something way worse than what I'm doing, you know?
00:11:06 Like, those alimony payments or, you know, whatever.
00:11:11 Although I have procrastinated on my taxes for a couple years, so.
00:11:16 Fair enough.
00:11:17 You know, this reminds me just of the cardinal sin that will make me hate you, listeners or fans.
00:11:22 If you do not put a space, when you're writing the name of the pro space,
00:11:28 Crastinator's podcast, I- some people actually committed this vile sin
00:11:33 in their submissions to the editor contest, and I'm just letting you know,
00:11:37 this will be a strike against you.
00:11:39 Oh, God.
00:11:41 My fucking peach, uh, uh, amiibo just fell and hit my router.
00:11:46 I was waiting for you to say your peach fresca.
00:11:50 I wish I had one of those.
00:11:52 But I don't.
00:11:56 Okay, what else is going on, people?
00:11:58 I'm bored.
00:11:58 This sucks.
00:11:59 Yeah, this is terrible.
00:12:02 Well, um-
00:12:02 Wait, you're like- you keep saying that, but you have nothing.
00:12:05 What- did you not think of anything before the show?
00:12:08 I've got nothing.
00:12:08 I've got nothing.
00:12:08 You're absolutely right.
00:12:09 Hey, let me scrape the bottom of the barrel here.
00:12:11 I'm off keto for, like, a day.
00:12:14 Was this, like, a cheat day?
00:12:16 I had a milkshake at RFC K-Con.
00:12:20 Then I had a beer and a cupcake.
00:12:22 Ah, I was decadent.
00:12:23 I'm surprised to hear that you're still doing keto because-
00:12:27 What's working?
00:12:27 I would assume that your kidney stone had something to do with it.
00:12:31 You know, everyone assumes that, and everyone says that.
00:12:33 But then I go and I look it up, and I find no data backing up that assertion.
00:12:38 I mean, where do you think you got it from, then?
00:12:40 Like-
00:12:41 From my kidney.
00:12:42 The kidney stone fairy.
00:12:43 Blessed him one day.
00:12:45 I mean, like, what generally causes kidney stones?
00:12:48 Like, have you done something that would have caused it?
00:12:52 I mean, this, okay, I've been complaining about this.
00:12:56 Everyone has their own, like, oh, obvi-
00:13:00 Of course you got a kidney stone, obviously, because you do X,
00:13:03 but, like, everyone's X is different.
00:13:05 And, like-
00:13:05 Sure.
00:13:06 So, like, what am I supposed to make of it?
00:13:08 Like, some people think it's obviously because-
00:13:10 Do everything different, man.
00:13:10 Some people think it's because it's obviously because of keto.
00:13:13 Some people think it's obviously because I drink sodas,
00:13:15 or because obviously because artificial sweeteners, or-
00:13:17 It's my bet.
00:13:18 Are those known to do that, though?
00:13:20 I don't know.
00:13:20 It's a perfect storm of all those Ben-Saint activities.
00:13:22 Well, I don't know.
00:13:23 I mean, I kind of thought so.
00:13:25 I don't know.
00:13:26 I did some cursory googling the other day, and I didn't-
00:13:28 I came away with the feeling that, like,
00:13:31 I was less sure about any of these things, like,
00:13:33 oh, this definitely caused it.
00:13:35 I mean, you can just get them.
00:13:37 Some people just get them, you know?
00:13:39 Some people just get cancer, even if they don't smoke or whatever.
00:13:43 Hey, total left turn, but I actually do have something I want to talk about.
00:13:48 I want to quickly just mention something about keto.
00:13:51 I've been listening to a lot of, like, stupid reddit readings about, like,
00:13:54 stupid threads or whatever, and, like, the anti-MLM thread.
00:13:57 And I've noticed a sort of a surge in MLM.
00:14:00 MLM is in multi-level marketing?
00:14:02 Yeah.
00:14:03 As in the PC pyramid scheme.
00:14:05 Indeed.
00:14:06 No, that's nothing like the pyramid scheme,
00:14:08 even though it's called the pyramid scheme.
00:14:09 It's called the pyramid scheme ironically.
00:14:12 Give us money now.
00:14:13 It'll be great for marketing purposes.
00:14:14 True fans know it's named ironically,
00:14:17 and donate all their money to it.
00:14:20 Anyway, and they are very keen on selling you keto products now,
00:14:26 so that's making me suspicious of keto.
00:14:28 Because they're like, oh, keto coffee.
00:14:31 You lose weight.
00:14:33 What a stupid way to reason through life.
00:14:35 Ben, have you ever been to, have you been to a vitamin shop recently
00:14:38 or passed by one in your travels?
00:14:39 No.
00:14:40 God, no.
00:14:41 If you have, you would notice that every single one of them
00:14:43 have big signs on the front now that say,
00:14:44 keto headquarters, get all your keto shit here.
00:14:46 Probably due to the whole, you know, there's like, there's companies,
00:14:50 and I mean, there's one company called Bulletproof,
00:14:53 but it's not the only one.
00:14:54 There's a bunch.
00:14:55 And they just sell shit.
00:14:57 But like, they just sell you food that's keto.
00:15:00 But like, here's, you can just go to the fucking supermarket
00:15:03 and buy like, butter and like, meat and like, cheese.
00:15:06 People are dumb.
00:15:07 And like, yeah.
00:15:09 You don't, like, they'll sell you.
00:15:10 It's so much easier, Ben, to just go to the,
00:15:13 go to your vitamin shop and buy the F-bomb.
00:15:16 They'll sell you.
00:15:17 It's literally called the F-bomb.
00:15:18 It's this bomb-shaped supplement.
00:15:20 It's just, and it's all just fat.
00:15:22 So they call it the fatbomb.
00:15:23 I think it's, yeah, bomb.
00:15:24 They'll sell you, they'll sell you a branded version.
00:15:27 They'll sell you a powdered version
00:15:29 in a smaller container for more money.
00:15:31 They'll put, they'll put things on the label.
00:15:33 They'll talk about the branch chain amino acids,
00:15:35 that whatever the fuck it is,
00:15:36 when it's just, it's just coconut oil or whatever.
00:15:38 I think people just convinced themselves
00:15:40 that they have to do something special for it to work.
00:15:43 That like, it couldn't possibly be
00:15:45 that the stuff is just at the grocery store they always go to.
00:15:48 It can't be as easy as just eating bacon
00:15:50 and losing weight.
00:15:50 It's impossible.
00:15:51 Yeah.
00:15:52 And yet, it's entirely possible.
00:15:54 There's a great video by the needle drop
00:15:57 about being vegan cheap because like,
00:16:02 lots of people say like,
00:16:03 I can't go vegan because it's expensive to buy healthy food.
00:16:06 And it's like, no, it's not.
00:16:08 Vegetables and fruit are like the cheapest thing
00:16:10 you can get at the fucking grocery store.
00:16:12 Like, you can buy bananas and fucking apples
00:16:15 for basically nothing.
00:16:16 Like 25 cents a piece or something.
00:16:18 Right.
00:16:18 They're carrots.
00:16:19 Oh man, I've been buying so many bananas recently.
00:16:22 Yeah.
00:16:22 All of those are extremely cheap.
00:16:23 So it's like, just because you're going vegan
00:16:25 doesn't mean you have to go buy fucking veggie burgers
00:16:28 or some shit.
00:16:29 The problem with that is that like,
00:16:31 yeah, fruits and vegetables are cheap,
00:16:33 but that's not a meal.
00:16:35 It's just a fruit and a vegetable.
00:16:37 Well, sure.
00:16:37 Like, it doesn't feel like I'm eating something
00:16:39 unless I've cooked a plate with a bread and a meat set.
00:16:42 That's the thing is that like,
00:16:44 people are making the argument of like,
00:16:45 I can't go vegan because it's expensive.
00:16:47 But it's like, well, the point of veganism,
00:16:50 if you're doing it, is that you're trying
00:16:52 to make some kind of moral stance.
00:16:54 So it's like, you're basically saying,
00:16:55 I'm putting my comfort above this moral stance.
00:16:58 And it's like, well, at that point,
00:16:59 you've defeated the purpose of it.
00:17:01 You know, like, just eat what you want to eat.
00:17:04 Like, if you're not going to, if you don't care,
00:17:06 if you don't feel strongly enough about it to commit to this lifestyle,
00:17:10 you know.
00:17:11 I don't know if Fantano's point was this or not,
00:17:13 but I, with some people talking about it,
00:17:14 people are just dumb and super ignorant,
00:17:17 and they just don't know these things.
00:17:19 Which I think was the point of this video,
00:17:21 to just educate people.
00:17:22 People, they just think that veganism is expensive,
00:17:26 and they don't actually know like,
00:17:27 what goes into being vegan or otherwise.
00:17:29 I don't know that much about veganism,
00:17:31 but I would have meant like, you know,
00:17:33 like getting your, getting the protein,
00:17:35 getting the proteins hard, and like,
00:17:36 It takes some work.
00:17:37 You probably got to get it from like,
00:17:38 Just eat nuts, like bees.
00:17:39 Something.
00:17:40 Yeah.
00:17:41 Yeah.
00:17:42 Isn't there something like, like,
00:17:43 like beans are like an incomplete protein?
00:17:45 Like if you're, you know, like,
00:17:46 if you're getting like vegetable protein,
00:17:47 you have to eat like the right, like,
00:17:49 different kinds combined.
00:17:50 The last class I ever took to get my
00:17:52 computer science degree was a biology course,
00:17:55 and I learned actually some fascinating facts in there,
00:17:57 which are, when you consume anything that like,
00:17:59 has protein in it, like beans or meat,
00:18:02 or anything like that,
00:18:03 they, the proteins consist of a certain select set
00:18:06 of the amino acids that human beings use
00:18:09 to assemble the like, you know,
00:18:11 muscle and protein stuff in our own bodies.
00:18:13 Yeah.
00:18:13 And so, like, if any beans.
00:18:14 But animal protein is complete protein,
00:18:16 because it's basically the same shit.
00:18:17 I would think that it's more complete, yes.
00:18:19 Oh, I know, is I don't believe anything
00:18:21 Anthony Fantano says, because I don't,
00:18:23 Fair it out.
00:18:24 I don't, I can't trust a man who reviews music
00:18:28 for a living and doesn't give every Red Hot Chili Peppers
00:18:31 album a 10 out of 10.
00:18:34 Even the newest one?
00:18:35 That would be the last one.
00:18:37 Yeah, sure, why not?
00:18:38 Oh, all right.
00:18:40 That's all I felt when I listened to it.
00:18:41 I was like, yeah, okay, sure, why not?
00:18:43 It's 10 out of 10.
00:18:46 Fair enough.
00:18:48 All right, what do you think about this, people?
00:18:50 Let me drop this bomb on you.
00:18:52 I want to talk about the Mathematosis
00:18:54 notification of people's opinions.
00:18:58 And the large extent of that.
00:19:00 Yeah, that's what it is.
00:19:02 So, Mathematosis, so whatever.
00:19:04 I think Breath of the Wild came out,
00:19:06 I think in 2016, maybe 2017.
00:19:10 So it's been like two or three years or whatever.
00:19:11 Yeah, God, it's that long?
00:19:13 It's been a while, yeah.
00:19:14 It was on the Wii U, so, you know.
00:19:16 What the fuck?
00:19:17 The Switch hasn't been out that long, has it?
00:19:20 No, well, I don't know, probably two or three years by this point.
00:19:23 It came out in March, I think, over two years ago.
00:19:25 Oh my God.
00:19:27 So, Mathematosis, years later, comes out with his review.
00:19:31 And this happens with other people.
00:19:32 I'm just using him as the example here.
00:19:34 And basically, to my mind, he was shockingly positive.
00:19:38 And I was not expecting this and was not prepared for it.
00:19:42 And coincidentally, I've already been replaying Breath of the Wild
00:19:47 by just, I had no idea he was making this video.
00:19:49 I was already like halfway through.
00:19:52 And I was basically playing the exact way
00:19:53 I had played the first time and still having a lot of fun.
00:19:56 But all my same complaints were still there.
00:19:59 And here's my point, here's my point.
00:20:02 I'm seeing a lot of threads on like V and stuff,
00:20:04 where people saying like, you know, they'll point to like one review
00:20:08 Mathematosis did of like God of War.
00:20:10 And they'll be like, haha, yeah, Matt's on my side.
00:20:12 God of War was shit.
00:20:14 And it wasn't great or something like that.
00:20:16 And then like the Breath of the Wild one comes out
00:20:19 and everyone like is ignoring it because it's not in line
00:20:22 with the general consensus or whatever.
00:20:25 And I'm sure other people have been swayed by it.
00:20:28 I don't know.
00:20:28 And in the video itself, he talks a lot about like,
00:20:32 basically what I gleaned was that he was focused on a lot of stuff
00:20:35 that a lot of people enjoyed about the game
00:20:36 that I did not get a lot out of.
00:20:38 Like all the crazy mechanical stuff you can do
00:20:41 with the systems that are in place.
00:20:43 And he seems to downplay a lot of things I didn't care for
00:20:46 and upplay the ones that he liked more.
00:20:49 So I don't know.
00:20:50 That's what a reviewer should do.
00:20:52 Well, I mean, I don't know.
00:20:53 Like he's just stating his opinion.
00:20:55 It may or may not completely overlap with mine.
00:20:57 You know, in this case, obviously not.
00:20:59 Okay.
00:21:00 But so what's my point is my point is
00:21:05 Matthew Matosa seems to be a real.
00:21:07 What's the word?
00:21:07 Like a trendsetter or like a thought leader?
00:21:09 A thought leader.
00:21:10 That's the word.
00:21:11 And I don't know.
00:21:13 I guess I'm just curious because he's not even like the biggest voice,
00:21:16 but there's something about him that makes people
00:21:18 just really take him seriously.
00:21:20 And I guess this ties into our old discussion about like the
00:21:23 what's Joseph Gordon Anderson, whatever his name is.
00:21:27 Well, it's professionalism.
00:21:28 Matthew Matosa doesn't have any like huge embarrassments
00:21:31 or fuck ups or, you know, retardation to his name.
00:21:34 Does Anderson?
00:21:35 Nothing to piss anyone.
00:21:36 Yeah, Anderson released a video that people interpreted as like
00:21:42 firing back at his commenters.
00:21:44 And I guess he's like shitty on streams and he's bad at games.
00:21:46 So, you know, people can't have that.
00:21:49 So, so there's a there's a noticeable vocal section
00:21:53 of his comments section is now that seems to hate him.
00:21:56 Yeah.
00:21:56 Yeah.
00:21:57 But I mean, you know, it just happens.
00:21:58 Like there's nothing you can really do about it.
00:22:00 But Matthew Matosa has been like shockingly professional
00:22:02 his whole career.
00:22:03 He I mean disappears completely and then comes out with a video
00:22:06 and he's gone.
00:22:06 I mean, I want to back up here for a second
00:22:08 because what Nate is describing applies to every reviewer.
00:22:12 Like everyone gets a parody.
00:22:13 This isn't a Matthew Matosa specific thing.
00:22:16 Right.
00:22:16 This is just what a whole leader is.
00:22:19 He's a holy cow, though.
00:22:20 He's he's untouched.
00:22:22 I mean, this is something that I get like a lot of people who hate me.
00:22:26 They hate me because other people parrot my videos at them,
00:22:31 that like when I make a video, there's a subset of people who
00:22:34 will say like this confirms that the show was bad, you know,
00:22:39 and like they won't then go on and just be like, yeah, well,
00:22:41 not like now I believe I'm objectively right because Digi Bro said
00:22:45 the thing I was thinking, even though I personally will literally
00:22:49 say like, hey, this is just my opinion.
00:22:51 Everybody is no, you know, I tend to reevaluate my opinions
00:22:55 when Digi agrees with me.
00:22:58 I've really noticed that I must whenever anyone says anything,
00:23:00 I immediately think of why they're wrong.
00:23:02 Like any of you or any of my family.
00:23:04 Yeah.
00:23:05 Oh, yeah, we feel it.
00:23:06 Oh, we feel it.
00:23:07 Why do I do that?
00:23:08 I don't know.
00:23:08 I don't know.
00:23:10 Strange man.
00:23:11 I don't feel like to play devil's advocate.
00:23:13 So every time we refer to you as best guy ever,
00:23:16 you should reevaluate that position, guys.
00:23:18 You should think carefully before you use such words,
00:23:20 which, you know, definitive.
00:23:23 On the subject of how everybody is stupid
00:23:26 and their opinions are bullshit, you
00:23:27 can't say anything without being responded to by fucking
00:23:30 simpletons.
00:23:32 In the last podcast, we brought up the Resident Evil 2 remake
00:23:35 recently.
00:23:36 And I was positive about it because you were at it.
00:23:38 I played it yesterday, by the way.
00:23:39 It was pretty fun.
00:23:40 It's really good.
00:23:41 Yeah, it's good.
00:23:43 So I said it was good in the last podcast.
00:23:45 And I see now a comment from someone who's like mad at me
00:23:48 for saying that it's good.
00:23:49 He's like, oh, it's just a shameless cash grab
00:23:52 for people who are nostalgic, like Jess.
00:23:56 It was like, if I wanted to be nostalgic,
00:23:58 I would play the original.
00:23:59 I wouldn't play the remake.
00:24:00 That makes no sense.
00:24:00 And then he's like, you know, outside from the visuals
00:24:03 and the overall quality, the game is boring.
00:24:05 So aside from waiting, he goes, yeah.
00:24:07 You're talking about the overall quality?
00:24:10 Yeah, this is a real comment.
00:24:11 Oh my god.
00:24:12 That's good.
00:24:13 That's real good.
00:24:13 He literally goes like, he literally goes,
00:24:16 the gameplay is tight.
00:24:17 And to the point, I appreciate that.
00:24:19 However, outside the visuals and overall quality,
00:24:21 the game is just boring.
00:24:23 He must mean something like the quality of just like the way
00:24:26 that I think what he's trying to say,
00:24:28 I think what he's trying to say is that the game is like
00:24:30 technically well made, but not interesting.
00:24:33 It lacks soul.
00:24:33 He's saying that it brings nothing new to the table,
00:24:35 that like it's just like the quintessential Resident Evil,
00:24:38 but like we just had Resident Evil 7,
00:24:39 which did bring a lot new to the table.
00:24:42 I mean, I was going to play the original Resident Evil.
00:24:44 And then I'm like, you know what?
00:24:45 Third person shooting just looks more fun.
00:24:47 I think I'll do that instead.
00:24:48 Like I'm not, I'm not trying to pick on this commentary.
00:24:50 I'm just, yeah, I happen to see him because like,
00:24:52 you know, I said something good about the game.
00:24:54 So of course I get blowback from someone who doesn't think
00:24:56 it's all that good, but I actually have a Resident Evil 2 video
00:24:59 coming out that is going to skew negative.
00:25:02 And I know when that comes out, I'm going to get the same
00:25:04 blowback from the other morons who think that like,
00:25:07 how dare you say something negative about it?
00:25:09 It's actually good.
00:25:09 That's true.
00:25:10 There's no winning.
00:25:11 On all sides of this, it's hard for me to understand
00:25:14 because like I just enjoy hearing people say their opinion
00:25:19 and justify it.
00:25:20 And it doesn't, it doesn't matter if I agree with,
00:25:24 like like Matthew Matosis' video on Breath of the Wild,
00:25:27 I fucking loved that video.
00:25:29 And I felt like he is extremely justified in feeling
00:25:32 the way he does about the game.
00:25:33 The game doesn't look like it appeals to me in any way.
00:25:36 Like, I don't know why lately my videos on games have been
00:25:40 skewing negative, like the Kingdom Hearts video.
00:25:42 It's like, I don't know, I think it's just like,
00:25:44 I feel like that's what YouTube deserves at this point
00:25:47 is just more of the negativity they all crave.
00:25:50 And well, I mean, your opinions seem reasonable.
00:25:52 So, you know, I'm not too surprised based on the content.
00:25:55 I don't ever feel like I'm being like too negative.
00:25:57 I always feel like I'm being fair, but people are like,
00:25:59 oh, this guy's bitter.
00:26:00 I'm not bitter about anything.
00:26:01 It's just, this is the kind of content you want
00:26:03 and this is the kind of content you deserve,
00:26:04 even if you don't want to admit that you want it.
00:26:06 Everyone knows like big takedown videos have always been
00:26:09 the most popular on YouTube.
00:26:11 And so, but yours, yours aren't big enough takedowns.
00:26:14 There's too much.
00:26:15 My videos are like five minutes long most of the time.
00:26:17 And usually just one point,
00:26:19 because I don't want to make a big video with 50 points
00:26:21 and take the rest of my life to make it.
00:26:23 You know, it's better to just, if you just want to say
00:26:26 one thing about a game, just say that one thing.
00:26:29 You don't have to make a whole fucking review analysis
00:26:31 to put that point in.
00:26:33 We always talk about this warmly,
00:26:34 but your video on The Hundred Knight or whatever,
00:26:36 The Witch and The Hundred Knight, that was,
00:26:39 that's like my favorite video you've made in several years,
00:26:41 I think, you know, not to say that the others are bad.
00:26:42 It's just that one stands out in my mind a lot.
00:26:44 It's so weird to me to see people who reject hearing
00:26:49 the opposite opinion, because I want to know why
00:26:53 people feel the opposite from me.
00:26:54 Like, the Gaming Brit just put out a glowing bike
00:26:58 comparison to anyone else, review of Kingdom Hearts 3.
00:27:01 Like, he loved it.
00:27:02 I skipped that one, so it won't influence me
00:27:04 while I'm still making mine.
00:27:06 Gaming Brit is one of the best channels on YouTube
00:27:08 that I've ever seen.
00:27:09 Yeah?
00:27:09 Gaming Brit's great.
00:27:09 He's so consistent.
00:27:11 He's a great channel,
00:27:13 and like, when I watch that video, I'm sitting there
00:27:16 and I'm like, this guy, he doesn't even bring up
00:27:20 any of the things that everyone else talked about
00:27:23 that they hated about Kingdom Hearts 3.
00:27:24 Like, he maybe like, is kind of like,
00:27:27 the cutscenes are kind of stupid sometimes,
00:27:29 but like, he just seemed to be into the game.
00:27:31 And like, that's great.
00:27:34 That should exist, even if I feel the opposite,
00:27:36 because obviously a lot of people feel that way.
00:27:39 So like, don't you want everyone's feelings
00:27:42 to be represented?
00:27:43 Like, that's the ideal.
00:27:45 You shouldn't be coming to one video
00:27:47 to be the ultimate video.
00:27:48 I want there to be every single possible take
00:27:51 represented, so I know why everyone feels differently
00:27:54 from each other.
00:27:54 Every opinion is like a tribe,
00:27:57 and like, you have one opinion.
00:27:58 You're in the tribe of people with your opinion,
00:28:00 and you want your tribe to dominate.
00:28:02 Yeah, that's very true.
00:28:04 I don't want my tribe to dominate.
00:28:05 I want to coexist.
00:28:07 I want diversity.
00:28:08 I want to quickly check.
00:28:08 We need more diversity in video games.
00:28:10 Disagree.
00:28:12 I need Ben to shut up.
00:28:13 Whoa.
00:28:15 Go on, go on.
00:28:16 Because I want to be like, hold on, hold on, hold on.
00:28:18 I've been wanting to interject.
00:28:19 We've got to talk about this.
00:28:20 No, we've got to get into what just went on here.
00:28:24 All right.
00:28:24 Yes, because I said, I want to interject,
00:28:26 and you started talking over me.
00:28:28 That's why I wanted you to shut up.
00:28:29 There's nothing more to it.
00:28:30 Indeed, agreed.
00:28:31 Talk about savage takedown.
00:28:32 Ben just got slapped down.
00:28:33 You know what, finally.
00:28:34 His reign of terror has been put to an end at last.
00:28:38 I just wanted to interject a bit earlier than I did speak up.
00:28:43 Like, I feel it, didn't you?
00:28:44 Because before the pony fandom, I never really felt like,
00:28:49 I never experienced people getting so upset
00:28:52 about other people expressing their opinions
00:28:54 that are different.
00:28:55 Because for me, personally, I love listening to opinions
00:28:59 about the things that I like or I hate,
00:29:02 even if they're different from mine.
00:29:03 Because for me, it's just extra content
00:29:05 talking about the thing that I like
00:29:06 or hate, I guess.
00:29:07 For instance, I really like Dragon Age,
00:29:10 and you bet you're ready.
00:29:11 I'm going to listen to every single review
00:29:13 about Dragon Age, be it good or bad,
00:29:15 because I want to know what they think.
00:29:16 Do they like it?
00:29:17 What do they dislike it?
00:29:18 And it gives me, like, I didn't really
00:29:21 think about it that way.
00:29:23 I guess that's kind of annoying.
00:29:24 Or like, oh, yeah, that's right.
00:29:25 Oh, I completely missed that thing.
00:29:27 Yes, I love this about the game.
00:29:29 You know?
00:29:29 It's just fun.
00:29:31 I don't understand.
00:29:32 The pony community, so the pony community
00:29:34 was really fucking partisan.
00:29:37 OK, that one, for sure, was very focused on being positive.
00:29:40 I don't know.
00:29:40 No, I'm saying partisan.
00:29:42 It was very, like, descent was very tribal,
00:29:45 and descent was very looked down on.
00:29:48 It was this weird, like, sort of one-of-a-kind group.
00:29:50 Like, it grew out of 4chan.
00:29:52 So there was always that, like, 4chan edgelord part of it.
00:29:55 But then it was also, like, this lovey-fluffy tumbler part
00:29:58 of it, too.
00:29:59 Because it was like, we're all outcasts.
00:30:01 We're all outcast together.
00:30:02 We all got to look after each other.
00:30:04 By not allowing descent.
00:30:06 There was, like, two pony fandoms.
00:30:07 And then there was a third that was just normal people who
00:30:10 no one fucking remembers.
00:30:11 I never met any of those.
00:30:14 I can't say I'm familiar.
00:30:15 There was only one, and it's my secret identity, me.
00:30:19 My secret identity, comma, me.
00:30:20 Hey, on the subject of, I don't know,
00:30:23 like, appreciating other people's opinions,
00:30:25 OK, I don't know about you guys.
00:30:26 But within my soul, I feel the growth of a villain.
00:30:31 I feel a villain emerging slowly over time.
00:30:34 This wasn't able, yeah.
00:30:35 Wait, when I was listening.
00:30:36 Wait, you've always been a villain.
00:30:38 What are you talking about?
00:30:39 Well, I aspire to be a little finger.
00:30:41 But I don't think I have the courage.
00:30:42 But, like, when I'm watching the Matthew Matosis video,
00:30:46 it was interesting.
00:30:47 Because we talked about this a bit.
00:30:48 And as I'm watching it, there was, like, I felt myself,
00:30:52 he used a lot of flowery language, right?
00:30:54 He used a lot of grandiose verbiage stuff.
00:30:56 I didn't get that.
00:30:57 I don't, you said that in the chat.
00:30:59 And I don't know what verbiage you're talking about.
00:31:00 Are you talking about Matthew Matosis?
00:31:02 Yes.
00:31:03 OK, OK, I want to say something.
00:31:04 Matthew Matosis' Breath of the Wild video
00:31:06 had multiple instances of him misusing words
00:31:10 that he really should know.
00:31:11 Oh, no.
00:31:12 Like what?
00:31:13 Oh, god.
00:31:14 Potato, potato, potato, potato, potato.
00:31:16 No, no, man.
00:31:17 OK, I'm sorry.
00:31:18 I can't think of any.
00:31:18 But, like, it must have been, like, six or seven times
00:31:21 for the whole video.
00:31:22 He, like, used the word, like, he used, like,
00:31:25 he would use, like, a word, like,
00:31:27 irregardless instead of irrespective or regard.
00:31:30 Like, that kind of thing.
00:31:31 And I was like, he doesn't, this is worse than usual.
00:31:34 You know.
00:31:36 He's getting dumber, guys.
00:31:37 He's getting dumber.
00:31:38 It was, it was, it was more free.
00:31:39 He doesn't usually do that.
00:31:41 But he did many times.
00:31:42 Maybe.
00:31:43 I wish I had a specific example on the tip of my tongue.
00:31:45 I noticed.
00:31:45 Matthew Matosis is so, yeah, go on.
00:31:47 I'm just saying, I never, I did neither caught that,
00:31:50 nor did I think there was any, like, weird words in there.
00:31:53 Like, I don't remember hearing anything that was out of place.
00:31:55 But, well, this is, here's the thing, though.
00:31:57 You liked the video.
00:31:59 I liked it.
00:32:00 There were things that I enjoyed watching.
00:32:01 In fact, I did enjoy watching it.
00:32:03 But, like, I had a kind of fundamental disagreement
00:32:06 of his point.
00:32:06 And here's the thing.
00:32:07 I think that because I just sort of disagreed
00:32:10 with the tact he was taking, because, like,
00:32:12 I made a video comparing two totally different games,
00:32:15 like, whatever, Hollow Knight versus Breath of the Wild.
00:32:18 And, like, they're very different.
00:32:19 But I like the style of Hollow Knight stuff more.
00:32:22 And, like, that kind of was, is what informed that entire,
00:32:25 which one I thought was better.
00:32:26 And, like, that still remains the case to this day.
00:32:30 And so, as I'm replaying the game now,
00:32:32 I still feel like, wow, this world, you know,
00:32:33 it's cool and all.
00:32:34 The film's pretty empty.
00:32:35 Whatever.
00:32:36 Matthew, he loved the freedom and stuff.
00:32:38 It's like, because we disagreed on a fundamental,
00:32:40 like, precept of his analysis, I felt myself
00:32:44 giving less charity to, like, his, like, art.
00:32:47 Like, whenever he makes, like, an artistic flair
00:32:49 in a sentence, I'm like, that's unnecessary.
00:32:52 Let's just catch the facts here.
00:32:52 I didn't notice any artistic flair in his sentences, though.
00:32:56 Any sentence that contains more than the basic number
00:32:59 of adjectives, verbs, and nouns required
00:33:01 to get the message across is a waste of my time.
00:33:04 I don't even know if I hear the individual points
00:33:07 or words that he's saying or making,
00:33:09 because, like, when I hear those videos all,
00:33:11 it's like a heroin trip.
00:33:12 I just feel like, yeah, talking about games.
00:33:14 I just fucking come over how he writes, like,
00:33:18 and the way that he, because the thing about Matthew Atosius
00:33:22 that I like about him above other critics
00:33:24 is that I feel like he really looks at everything
00:33:28 that the game could have been, like,
00:33:31 as opposed to just looking at what's there
00:33:34 and then saying, here's whether that was good or bad.
00:33:37 He looks at it and says, like, here's what could have been done
00:33:41 and whether that would have made it better or worse
00:33:43 or, like, why these choices were made, you know,
00:33:47 why these things all work together and stuff.
00:33:49 It's like he's taking a lens that goes beyond the game
00:33:51 into, like, just the whole possibility space
00:33:55 of what a game could even be.
00:33:57 And not enough critics are doing that.
00:33:59 I just love that he, I just love that he just never seems
00:34:03 even remotely combative about anything.
00:34:05 Like, he never seems to bring up what anyone else is saying.
00:34:08 He doesn't, like, his videos exist in a nice little warm bubble.
00:34:11 And I don't think he reads anyone else's shit.
00:34:13 Good. That's the best thing you could probably do.
00:34:15 That is wise, I'd say.
00:34:17 Yeah, he just, he feels like he just, he takes his fucking time.
00:34:21 He analyzes every single facet of the game.
00:34:24 And as you said, yeah, he really thinks about, like,
00:34:26 the potential of it.
00:34:27 Like, I don't know, when I played a game like Metal Gear Solid 5,
00:34:31 I kind of loved that game and come back to it
00:34:33 because I just don't care about the story
00:34:35 and I've just gotten over that, that it's total shit.
00:34:38 And, like, that game could have been, like, amazing
00:34:41 if the story was good, but it doesn't even bother me.
00:34:44 So I get why someone would literally give it a 0 out of 10
00:34:47 if they're, like, a huge Metal Gear fan.
00:34:49 But for somebody like me, it was, like, a 9 out of 10
00:34:51 just because I enjoyed playing the mission so much.
00:34:53 Well, that's the thing.
00:34:54 And that's what it looks like with Breath of the Wild,
00:34:57 where when that game came out,
00:34:59 all the people I saw praising it
00:35:01 were all people who like to push mechanics to the extreme.
00:35:05 Like, Dunkey is somebody who will find every possible thing
00:35:10 that you can do in that game
00:35:11 because he likes to experiment with a game.
00:35:14 I like to have a guided experience.
00:35:16 And, like, with Breath of the Wild in particular,
00:35:18 I'm afraid to play that game
00:35:19 because when I play Zelda, I like to try to find everything.
00:35:23 Like, the fun for me is in these worlds are densely crafted
00:35:27 in that, you know, every time I get a new item,
00:35:29 like, there's an immediate application for it in this place
00:35:32 to get this thing, to check something off the list
00:35:34 and be done, you know?
00:35:36 The idea of an endless possibility space
00:35:39 just doesn't appeal to me at all.
00:35:40 And so I wouldn't want to play it, you know?
00:35:43 Speaking of guided experiences and Zelda, conspiracy theory,
00:35:49 who else thinks that Egoraptor was paid off
00:35:52 to plug the bayou, the blue bayou restaurant
00:35:56 in his fucking Zelda Ocarina of Time video?
00:36:00 That's such a weird joke.
00:36:02 It's such a weird moment in that video
00:36:03 when he takes a little tangent to talk about
00:36:05 how much he likes the blue bayou restaurant.
00:36:07 And it sounds like a joke, but it's not funny at all.
00:36:10 It's only funny because he says it as though it's a joke.
00:36:12 But it's not, it's just him endorsing a restaurant.
00:36:14 And I hate it.
00:36:15 That could be a joke.
00:36:16 Don't remember that at all.
00:36:17 You've probably watched that video a lot more time ago.
00:36:19 He's obsessed about this.
00:36:20 He is.
00:36:22 Every day I think about the fucking,
00:36:23 how much I hate the blue bayou restaurant.
00:36:25 He's just like, it's when he's comparing the link
00:36:29 to the past to a theme park.
00:36:33 He's like, oh, welcome to Treyarch.
00:36:34 Try our fucking Trice Force shaped ice cream pops.
00:36:39 Hey, I love Disney World.
00:36:41 I go like six times a year.
00:36:44 I love the blue bayou restaurant.
00:36:46 They got great food.
00:36:47 Oh, that's a little pricey.
00:36:49 But you know what?
00:36:49 It's worth it.
00:36:50 Why?
00:36:51 That's a good joke.
00:36:52 Why is that a good joke?
00:36:54 What's funny about that?
00:36:55 It's a little pricey, but you know what?
00:36:56 It's worth it the way he says it.
00:36:58 It's fucking hilarious.
00:36:59 That's what I'm saying.
00:36:59 It's not a joke.
00:37:00 It's just he says it as though it's a joke,
00:37:02 which kind of makes it funny.
00:37:03 But it's such it's a joke.
00:37:06 The joke is that he says it in a funny way.
00:37:08 That's not a joke.
00:37:10 It's just a funny voice.
00:37:12 That's a little bit pricey.
00:37:14 That's a little pricey.
00:37:15 But you know what it's worth it?
00:37:17 I'll bet it's not fucking worth it.
00:37:18 Fuck that guy.
00:37:19 It's fucking human core.
00:37:20 Eagle Raptor is so fucking human core.
00:37:22 He enjoys food at restaurants.
00:37:25 That's disgusting.
00:37:26 That's gay.
00:37:26 The theme parks, human core.
00:37:29 I denounce them.
00:37:32 That's my two cents about that.
00:37:34 What were we talking about?
00:37:35 I don't know.
00:37:37 A mom and pop restaurant is human core.
00:37:39 A theme park is like a weird like a hamster wheel
00:37:43 created for us to run in by like our overlords.
00:37:45 I think I agreed.
00:37:47 But I still think that's human core.
00:37:49 It's like it's like manufactured human core.
00:37:51 What's human core?
00:37:53 Mage, why don't you get in your time machine
00:37:57 and go back to fucking August last year.
00:38:01 Go back to September 11th, 2001.
00:38:04 And I'll show you what human core looks like.
00:38:08 Excuse me for not caring about shit.
00:38:10 Oh fuck.
00:38:11 She says 9-11 doesn't matter.
00:38:13 That's the European stance.
00:38:15 That's fucked up.
00:38:16 That's fucked up.
00:38:18 You know human core.
00:38:19 Like it's for idiots.
00:38:24 Oh no.
00:38:27 You're gonna put your foot down over there Ben.
00:38:29 Hell yeah Tom.
00:38:30 High hoof.
00:38:31 High hoof me bro.
00:38:32 High hoof me in the gross disgusting audio links.
00:38:34 No.
00:38:36 Show notes.
00:38:37 Put that in the show notes everybody.
00:38:39 It's happening.
00:38:40 It's happening in real time right now.
00:38:43 So what else is going on people?
00:38:45 Well, I'm dying.
00:38:48 Yeah.
00:38:50 Let's talk about my cool hangover
00:38:51 that I am currently suffering right now.
00:38:54 Okay.
00:38:55 So yeah, I feel bad.
00:38:57 I was just coming in.
00:38:59 Just I was coming in the door as I saw
00:39:01 that this podcast was starting and I'm like,
00:39:03 I really shouldn't because I want to be dead.
00:39:07 But I also would like money.
00:39:09 So I came on, which is really my mindset every single week.
00:39:12 But this time it was more so
00:39:14 because I actually got sick.
00:39:14 Yeah, what if you live, you need money for that.
00:39:16 What series of events led you to this night of debauchery
00:39:19 that I'm sure follow this morning of agony?
00:39:22 You mean preceded.
00:39:24 That's right.
00:39:24 That's right.
00:39:25 Right, okay.
00:39:26 I want you too much Matthew Matosis.
00:39:27 He's a lot of words.
00:39:28 Well, I went out partying last night with Juan,
00:39:31 who I talked about last week.
00:39:33 Indeed.
00:39:33 The Angels Forever thing.
00:39:34 And by the way, thank you everybody.
00:39:36 There was like a thousand dollar bump
00:39:39 and it's only been a couple of days.
00:39:40 That's great.
00:39:40 So that's really cool.
00:39:42 And holy shit.
00:39:43 And fucking Juan was really happy
00:39:44 and he loved me and people liked me.
00:39:47 So it worked.
00:39:48 People liked me now.
00:39:49 People think that I'm good.
00:39:50 That makes me a...
00:39:51 I fooled them.
00:39:52 It's nice.
00:39:53 You know, we have this weird little clusterfuck of a podcast
00:39:56 about nothing.
00:39:57 It's nice that something good happened
00:40:00 because of it for once.
00:40:01 Yeah.
00:40:02 Yeah.
00:40:03 I got to finish chewing my hangover crackle.
00:40:06 We are the reason the human humanity is dying.
00:40:09 We're the reason people are dying.
00:40:10 But not today.
00:40:11 Except Ivan.
00:40:13 Yeah, except Ivan.
00:40:14 The one person who won't die
00:40:15 because of this podcast.
00:40:16 There'll be the last man left.
00:40:17 I hope we won't be spared.
00:40:18 The last man standing.
00:40:22 So I went out partying with Juan
00:40:24 and also my friend Dylan
00:40:25 because it was his birthday.
00:40:26 So we're all...
00:40:27 We got to fucking bar worth of this cool bar.
00:40:29 We're like...
00:40:31 We didn't have chairs.
00:40:32 I mean, there was a table.
00:40:33 But then there was also a stand-up thing.
00:40:35 I was at the standing up part.
00:40:36 So I felt cool because I'm like,
00:40:37 yeah, I'm standing up at the food eating my pizza thing.
00:40:40 So that was cool.
00:40:42 And like...
00:40:43 So then, you know, there were drinks and stuff.
00:40:45 So like, I don't drink
00:40:47 or I don't like drinking ever.
00:40:49 It's bad.
00:40:50 I hate it.
00:40:50 I don't like being drunk.
00:40:52 I don't like after being drunk.
00:40:54 Feel the same way more or less.
00:40:56 Even though I drink sometimes.
00:40:57 Yeah.
00:40:58 But I also am really desperate for approval.
00:41:02 So I can't turn down a drink ever.
00:41:04 I can't turn down anything.
00:41:05 If someone says we're drinking,
00:41:07 I'm like, well, I'm drinking the most.
00:41:09 It's me.
00:41:10 It's good ol' energy.
00:41:11 I'm gonna drink.
00:41:12 I'm gonna be the coolest guy here
00:41:13 and everyone's gonna like me.
00:41:15 The coolest, drunkest guy.
00:41:17 Exactly.
00:41:18 Which really is synonymous.
00:41:22 So...
00:41:22 I feel you.
00:41:23 I was...
00:41:24 So I was drinking.
00:41:25 I did some tequila shots
00:41:27 with the salt on the hand.
00:41:28 And then I went to the place
00:41:30 and I got this thing called
00:41:31 A Man With No Name,
00:41:32 which is like some kind of whiskey drink.
00:41:33 But the ice cube was like a big round ice ball.
00:41:35 It looked like a ball of ice.
00:41:37 It was really cool.
00:41:38 I've always wanted one of those.
00:41:39 And as I was drinking it,
00:41:40 sort of like the poison in the alcohol
00:41:43 was like melting into the ice cube,
00:41:46 ice ball.
00:41:47 And it created like a ridge
00:41:48 around the circumference of the ice ball.
00:41:50 So it looked like the Death Star.
00:41:51 So that was really cool.
00:41:52 So I got another one of those
00:41:53 because I liked that it was a Death Star
00:41:55 kind of looking thing.
00:41:57 So then I got this dragon fruit
00:42:00 fucking red fruity beer drink
00:42:03 and that was fucking tasty.
00:42:06 And even after all that,
00:42:07 I was doing fine.
00:42:07 I was feeling...
00:42:08 You know, I was loosey-goosey.
00:42:09 I was making jokes.
00:42:10 I was being cool.
00:42:11 You know, I'm just walking around
00:42:12 like, hey, I'm just being cool.
00:42:14 I'm just being cool.
00:42:16 And you know,
00:42:16 everyone was telling me that I'm cool
00:42:18 because the podcast...
00:42:19 My friends, by the way,
00:42:20 didn't even know that I have a podcast
00:42:22 because I'm so ashamed
00:42:24 of this part of my life normally
00:42:26 that I haven't told anyone in my real world
00:42:28 anything about what I do.
00:42:30 I never post like shit on Facebook.
00:42:32 No one knows anything.
00:42:33 And that's how I like it.
00:42:34 So they didn't even know
00:42:35 that I had a podcast until I said,
00:42:37 hey, I shouted out Ivan on the thing.
00:42:39 So that was cool.
00:42:40 So they were proud of me for telling people
00:42:43 about the GoFundMe
00:42:44 and also proud of me for having a podcast
00:42:46 which they didn't know.
00:42:47 So definitely, that's nice.
00:42:48 It's only been going for three years.
00:42:50 Yeah, so I was...
00:42:51 Yeah.
00:42:52 Yeah.
00:42:53 So yeah.
00:42:54 So even after that,
00:42:55 I was feeling good.
00:42:56 I took some selfies in the bar.
00:42:58 You know, my friend had these cool geckos.
00:43:00 I took a picture of one.
00:43:01 I was like, look at this fucking gecko boy.
00:43:03 Oh, I want you to do a gecko, please.
00:43:05 Oh, it's on Instagram.
00:43:06 I gecko-grammed.
00:43:07 That's the single most interesting thing
00:43:09 in the last half hour.
00:43:14 Mage out for blood today.
00:43:16 Mage is the reason people are dying
00:43:18 because she's murdering them
00:43:19 with her vicious words.
00:43:22 So I was feeling fine
00:43:23 till we got back to the apartment.
00:43:25 But then this girl who like...
00:43:27 Now that's trouble right there.
00:43:29 Oh yeah, this girl who I call,
00:43:32 who I refer to all night as Facy Woman
00:43:35 because she had a face and she was a woman.
00:43:38 And like...
00:43:39 Typical.
00:43:40 Fucking typical.
00:43:42 Because like it was a face that I knew that I had...
00:43:44 Like I knew that I've met this person
00:43:47 probably 11 times before.
00:43:48 I recognized her face,
00:43:50 but I didn't know her name until someone said it
00:43:52 and like, oh, that's your name.
00:43:53 I've just been calling you Facy Woman this whole time.
00:43:55 And then that caught on
00:43:56 and then everyone started calling her Facy Woman.
00:43:58 Oh, I bet she loved that.
00:44:00 But uh...
00:44:01 Oh yeah.
00:44:02 But she was...
00:44:02 She does have a face.
00:44:03 She does have a face.
00:44:04 It was a cool face.
00:44:05 She's a cool face person.
00:44:07 So she was like...
00:44:10 Like baby bouncing this jug of like potion,
00:44:13 this drink,
00:44:14 this like fucking...
00:44:16 This snot juice or baby slime or whatever.
00:44:18 Dandling it?
00:44:19 Yeah, on her knee.
00:44:20 So she was going around
00:44:21 and she started like pouring that
00:44:22 into people's...
00:44:23 Agape mouths,
00:44:24 like chickens looking up
00:44:25 and drowning in a rainstorm.
00:44:27 So, you know,
00:44:28 I allowed that to happen to me a few times
00:44:31 and that's when everything went crazy.
00:44:35 And you know,
00:44:36 when I get drunk enough,
00:44:37 I become God.
00:44:38 So I was sitting there,
00:44:40 I was doing the jokes,
00:44:41 I was saying the cool things,
00:44:42 I was making everybody laugh and you know.
00:44:45 And you know.
00:44:45 But of course,
00:44:46 sometimes I'm too funny for normal people,
00:44:49 I guess.
00:44:50 Yeah.
00:44:50 Because like...
00:44:51 Yeah.
00:44:51 You know,
00:44:52 because I was telling my jokes,
00:44:53 you know,
00:44:53 I might have let fly a couple of cool n-bombs.
00:44:58 And some wacky f-bombs, you know.
00:45:00 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:45:02 You know, and some silly...
00:45:03 You're painting a picture here.
00:45:05 Yeah.
00:45:05 And some colorful rape jokes or something,
00:45:08 I don't know.
00:45:09 Not a lot of rape jokes,
00:45:10 just an appropriate amount,
00:45:12 I would say.
00:45:12 Yeah.
00:45:13 Whatever you think the right amount is,
00:45:15 it was that amount.
00:45:17 Yeah.
00:45:17 But I began to notice
00:45:18 like a slight shift in the room
00:45:21 and it's like...
00:45:22 It's like, guys, come on.
00:45:23 This isn't the internet.
00:45:24 You don't have to pretend to be offended by things.
00:45:26 It's okay to laugh at n-bombs and stuff.
00:45:29 But no one believes me
00:45:30 because the world has gone crazy.
00:45:31 And really,
00:45:33 it's not that everyone was offended,
00:45:35 but there was this one guy sitting next to me on the couch,
00:45:38 this one cuck who's f-cking...
00:45:41 Like, I don't know.
00:45:42 I said something that was too funny for him.
00:45:44 I said like a rape joke or something.
00:45:46 Yeah.
00:45:46 And he like,
00:45:47 he slapped me in the face.
00:45:49 No, f-cking way.
00:45:50 What?
00:45:52 Yeah.
00:45:52 And like...
00:45:52 All right, well, that's uncalled for.
00:45:54 It wasn't like a hard slap,
00:45:56 but it was hard enough to be annoying.
00:45:58 Yeah.
00:45:58 That's f-cked.
00:45:59 That's straight up escalating the violence.
00:46:01 You don't do that.
00:46:02 You don't do that.
00:46:03 Yeah.
00:46:03 And I said,
00:46:04 whoa, what was that for?
00:46:05 And he just did it again.
00:46:07 And I'm like, okay.
00:46:07 What the f-ck?
00:46:08 What were you doing?
00:46:08 Why you sl-
00:46:09 I didn't say anything.
00:46:10 What are you doing?
00:46:11 And like,
00:46:11 and he did it like three or four times.
00:46:12 He kept like slapping.
00:46:13 And again, like, it wasn't like hard...
00:46:15 What?
00:46:15 Like really painful slaps,
00:46:17 but it was hard enough that it became
00:46:18 really f-cking normal.
00:46:19 Trying to get you to punch him in the f-cking face?
00:46:20 Like, what the f-ck?
00:46:20 Yeah, so that's what everybody does.
00:46:22 Everybody wants to get punched.
00:46:23 Everybody wants to f-ck with me.
00:46:24 Everywhere I go.
00:46:25 I don't know why,
00:46:26 no matter where I am,
00:46:27 no matter what I'm doing,
00:46:28 there's always one f-cking person
00:46:30 who just can't handle it.
00:46:32 One person who doesn't understand
00:46:33 that I'm just being cool
00:46:35 and has to get their undies twisted.
00:46:37 Because I guess I just intimidate people
00:46:38 with my overwhelming charisma.
00:46:40 So they have to find some way
00:46:42 to try and tear me down
00:46:43 to alleviate that sense of worthlessness
00:46:45 they feel in my shadow.
00:46:48 So he kept doing it a couple times
00:46:50 until finally I had to put some dad
00:46:52 in my voice and went,
00:46:53 Stop!
00:46:54 Some dad.
00:46:55 This party will become not fun
00:46:57 if you hit me one more time,
00:46:59 I promise.
00:47:00 So then he stopped,
00:47:01 and so that guy was gay.
00:47:02 Yeah.
00:47:02 But nah, he was alright.
00:47:03 We became friends, I guess.
00:47:05 Not really, I hope he dies, but...
00:47:08 I feel many ways about many things.
00:47:09 If you got a f-cking problem,
00:47:11 you say, like,
00:47:12 hey man, you know,
00:47:14 not to be a buzz kill or anything,
00:47:16 but I'm personally a fan, you know.
00:47:18 But my wife is black
00:47:20 and is a rape victim,
00:47:21 so the jokes are a little bit sore on me.
00:47:24 Fucking words in these situations.
00:47:25 I mean, even that,
00:47:26 I believe.
00:47:27 It would have been...
00:47:28 Like, if I made a joke,
00:47:30 and someone was like,
00:47:30 oh man, that offends me
00:47:31 because of, you know,
00:47:32 this reason or like,
00:47:33 hey, there's a fucking black guy
00:47:34 right next to you
00:47:35 and he feels bad
00:47:35 because you said that word 50 times
00:47:37 in one sentence,
00:47:38 then I would be like,
00:47:39 okay, I'm sorry.
00:47:40 Yeah, you don't go from,
00:47:41 you don't go from silent to
00:47:44 fucking slap in a guy
00:47:45 to silent to violent.
00:47:46 Silent to violent.
00:47:48 Chris been walked.
00:47:49 I just can't...
00:47:50 There is no words
00:47:51 that can come out of someone's face
00:47:53 that I think a slap
00:47:54 is an inappropriate response to ever.
00:47:56 Agreed.
00:47:57 I guess something like,
00:47:59 if you don't stop me now,
00:48:00 I will assassinate your dad
00:48:02 or, you know, something like that.
00:48:04 What if they say slap me?
00:48:06 I'm not gonna slap somebody
00:48:08 just because they told me to.
00:48:08 Yeah, I don't wanna go there.
00:48:10 I'll need some cajoling.
00:48:12 I'll need some cajoling
00:48:13 to follow through on that.
00:48:14 What if they say I'll pay you to slap me?
00:48:17 That's the cajoling I'm looking for.
00:48:20 It's weird to me because, like,
00:48:21 you can tell that nobody in the room
00:48:23 is really offended.
00:48:24 Like, most people are laughing.
00:48:26 Everybody's, like, having a good time,
00:48:28 but, like, there's this sense in people
00:48:30 that they have to pretend to be offended
00:48:32 and they just have to play along
00:48:34 with the idea of, like,
00:48:35 oh, you can't say that.
00:48:37 And it's like, you're not offended.
00:48:38 Stop pretending and don't touch me.
00:48:40 Well, it's not even that there's an offense
00:48:43 at that point.
00:48:44 It's that they're afraid to laugh.
00:48:47 Yeah.
00:48:47 Because, like, what's everybody else gonna think?
00:48:49 I can't, like, this can't be funny to me,
00:48:51 even though it's fucking great.
00:48:52 Yeah, and maybe it's also, like,
00:48:53 a virtue signaling thing,
00:48:54 of they wanna be like,
00:48:54 hey, just so everyone knows,
00:48:56 I'm not cool with this,
00:48:57 so, you know, like, that's a part for sure.
00:48:59 I don't even get what it was that I said
00:49:01 that set him off,
00:49:02 because it's not like I was just spewing
00:49:05 this torrent of outrageous, hateful shit.
00:49:07 I know how to read the room.
00:49:09 Everything was fine.
00:49:10 Yeah, yeah.
00:49:12 But anyways, that's just a minor aside.
00:49:13 That's not like a whole big thing.
00:49:14 We started playing games.
00:49:16 We started, you know,
00:49:16 drinking more of that baby slime out of the tap.
00:49:19 And, you know, we were playing Liar's Dice,
00:49:21 like Orlando Bloom and Pirates of the Caribbean,
00:49:23 part two.
00:49:23 Nice.
00:49:24 Anyways, then I started puking.
00:49:26 I was puking all over the fucking place,
00:49:29 by which I mean the toilet,
00:49:30 because I'm pretty, like,
00:49:31 I'm pretty swift when I feel a puke coming.
00:49:33 I can get, like,
00:49:34 I can weave in and out of people
00:49:36 and slalom my way to the bathroom.
00:49:38 Oh, the word slalom.
00:49:40 Would you say you're a man who can handle his puke?
00:49:42 The last time I heard that word slalom
00:49:44 was, like, in the phone stones cartoon.
00:49:46 And I never knew what it meant.
00:49:49 No idea.
00:49:50 I just know it because of the impossible
00:49:52 driver tutorial on PlayStation 1,
00:49:54 where you gotta fucking do all that shit
00:49:55 in the garage on the first level
00:49:57 and slalom your way through the fucking pillars.
00:49:59 That is such a weird word.
00:50:02 It is.
00:50:02 I don't think I've ever heard that word.
00:50:04 Slalom.
00:50:04 Like, no one should ever say that.
00:50:05 Is it not really just skiing?
00:50:07 Is there a slope involved?
00:50:08 Yeah, it's a skiing thing.
00:50:09 It's like an, like, you go between the flags.
00:50:09 I knew it was some kind of Olympic winter sport thing.
00:50:12 Yeah, it's just, like, weaving in and out of.
00:50:14 Oh, okay, okay.
00:50:16 You know, I know what happens to everybody.
00:50:19 Like, everybody knows that everybody pukes
00:50:21 when they drink.
00:50:22 But, like, you don't,
00:50:23 but you never want to be the guy
00:50:24 who's the puke-y guy at the party
00:50:26 while it's happening.
00:50:27 You want to be able to hold it in until you're alone.
00:50:29 No.
00:50:30 The next day, like, now.
00:50:31 Oh.
00:50:32 When someone starts puking,
00:50:33 that's when everyone's like,
00:50:34 oh, dear.
00:50:35 Oh, boy.
00:50:37 It signals the third act of any good party.
00:50:39 I mean, the best way to puke at a party
00:50:42 is to be like a dog who knows
00:50:44 he's not long for this world,
00:50:45 so you crawl into the porch to just dial on
00:50:48 so no one can see it.
00:50:49 You got to get out of there
00:50:50 before anyone knows you're puking.
00:50:51 Puking in silence and hopefully come back
00:50:53 and you're like, hey, nothing happened.
00:50:54 Or come back and be like,
00:50:55 hey, I puked, but I'm okay.
00:50:58 Don't worry.
00:50:58 Like, because I've been to a lot,
00:51:00 like, when me and my friends used to drink a lot.
00:51:02 That's not always possible.
00:51:04 It's not just that somebody would start puking.
00:51:07 It's that they would become bad.
00:51:10 Like, the moment when somebody gets to a point
00:51:14 where everyone else is worried about them,
00:51:15 that's when the party's dead.
00:51:16 Yeah.
00:51:17 Because it sobers you up.
00:51:18 Like, if you're not drunk enough to be that guy,
00:51:21 then you will become sober
00:51:23 by wanting to help that guy, you know?
00:51:26 Yeah.
00:51:27 Well, my whole thing is that just like,
00:51:29 I have a deep-seated need
00:51:30 to be the coolest guy in the room at all costs.
00:51:34 So, like, I will drink more than anyone.
00:51:38 I'll drink anything anyone gives me.
00:51:39 If somebody says to me, like,
00:51:41 I won't do something, like,
00:51:42 ah, you won't drink this much.
00:51:43 I'll be like, oh, you said the wrong thing to me, Buster.
00:51:46 Whoa, with the heart on it.
00:51:48 I don't know.
00:51:48 It's a Leo thing.
00:51:49 You know, I just got to be the guy.
00:51:54 I'm like, I'm really into astrology.
00:51:56 Also, that's my new thing.
00:51:58 Whoa, whoa.
00:51:59 What?
00:52:00 Not really.
00:52:01 Where did that come from?
00:52:03 Well, I was watching the Orville
00:52:04 and there was an episode about, like,
00:52:05 a planet of people who are, like,
00:52:07 obsessed with astrology.
00:52:08 And they, they, like, they do, like,
00:52:09 a genocide thing of people
00:52:10 who were born under a certain sign.
00:52:13 So I was watching that and I'm like,
00:52:14 yeah, that's a good society.
00:52:15 I would, that'd be cool.
00:52:16 I would like to get rid of all the Scorpios.
00:52:17 That'd be awesome.
00:52:18 No.
00:52:21 My dad's a Scorpio.
00:52:24 Poor bastard.
00:52:24 Riveting.
00:52:25 You would kill me.
00:52:26 You would kill me.
00:52:27 That hurts, man.
00:52:28 Well, you'd thank him for it, Tom.
00:52:30 Are you a, are you a, are you a,
00:52:32 are you a Scorpion, Tom?
00:52:33 I am a Scorpio, yeah.
00:52:34 Everyone, signs, me, Aries,
00:52:37 fire sign, Beth sign.
00:52:38 I'm a cancer.
00:52:39 I think that's water, I think.
00:52:41 Leo, lion, king of the jungle, best guy.
00:52:43 Taurus, earth, glad it's not water.
00:52:49 Digi.
00:52:49 Do you know Digi?
00:52:50 Any idea?
00:52:51 Digi's also a Leo.
00:52:52 It's Leo.
00:52:53 Okay.
00:52:53 Where'd he go?
00:52:54 Uh, I guess he's dead?
00:52:55 Digi.
00:52:55 I was trying to find a,
00:52:56 I was trying to think of a way to transition out
00:52:58 instead of giving an answer,
00:52:59 but I didn't come up with anything in time.
00:53:01 Too late.
00:53:02 Crap.
00:53:04 Out, outplayed.
00:53:07 Well, what else happened then, Jay?
00:53:08 Go on, go on.
00:53:08 So, you know, I, I would be like hanging out and be like,
00:53:10 oh, make way, people, it's pukey time.
00:53:13 And I got up and I would like,
00:53:15 Russia, I would dart to the bathroom.
00:53:17 Mm-hmm.
00:53:17 It was definitely a dart motion,
00:53:19 like I would whoosh.
00:53:20 And I did that like two or three times,
00:53:23 I think, over the course of the night.
00:53:24 Like, and one of the times when I was in there
00:53:25 puking, I was like, well, I'm in here,
00:53:27 I might as well poop too.
00:53:28 So I pooped on my puke.
00:53:29 And that was really cool.
00:53:30 God damn.
00:53:31 All right.
00:53:32 Can flush more than once.
00:53:34 Because like, normally I would never poop
00:53:35 in another person's house,
00:53:36 but if they think I'm in there puking,
00:53:38 then I have, you know,
00:53:38 carte blanche to secretly poop
00:53:40 while I'm at it.
00:53:41 That's true.
00:53:42 Secretly poop.
00:53:43 No one will ever know.
00:53:45 Yeah.
00:53:45 So then, you know, I came out,
00:53:46 and then the party was starting to thin
00:53:47 and people were leaving.
00:53:48 So then it was just me and my friend.
00:53:50 So, you know, me and my friend
00:53:52 started having like emotional real talk,
00:53:54 and that's miserable for all parties involved.
00:53:56 And no one wants to do that,
00:53:57 but it's just a part of the party.
00:53:58 You have to do it at some point.
00:53:59 It's like a ritual for men, I guess.
00:54:01 Men who otherwise fucking just push
00:54:03 everything down all day for their whole lives.
00:54:06 You know, you gotta have that drunk
00:54:08 meeting of the minds at every party
00:54:10 at least once with your genuine broken.
00:54:13 So, I don't know.
00:54:15 So then that was the party,
00:54:16 and then I woke up in the morning
00:54:18 choking on my own vomit,
00:54:19 like fucking ACDC.
00:54:21 So then I fucking went.
00:54:22 We stopped at McDonald's in the way home,
00:54:24 and I got an orange juice,
00:54:25 and I don't know why the fuck I did that.
00:54:27 Because then I came home and started the podcast,
00:54:29 and then I immediately had to disappear
00:54:30 for 15 minutes to fucking vomit up orange juice,
00:54:34 and it was acid-y, and it hurt, and it tastes bad,
00:54:36 and now I'm drinking tea,
00:54:37 but now the tea tastes like vomit and orange juice
00:54:39 because it's coating the inside of my mouth,
00:54:42 and that's my grumbly story
00:54:44 about how hungover and sad I am.
00:54:46 Incredible. Not bad.
00:54:47 But I would do it all again
00:54:49 if somebody told me that they would like me.
00:54:52 In fact, there's another party tonight.
00:54:55 While Jesse was getting shit-faced at a party,
00:54:59 I, the night before, was taking three tabs of acid,
00:55:04 and it was pretty fucking cool.
00:55:09 While I was doing that,
00:55:10 you, the night before, did something.
00:55:14 What was that experience like?
00:55:16 It was pretty fucking sick.
00:55:18 Me and Zen Huxtable did a bunch of acid,
00:55:21 found your drugs, kids.
00:55:23 Listen, do drugs, though.
00:55:24 You can do some drugs.
00:55:25 Not kids, but...
00:55:26 No, don't do it.
00:55:27 As long as you're 18.
00:55:31 Yeah, kids don't do drugs if you're 18.
00:55:32 Hey, kids. Do a lot of drugs.
00:55:34 It's me. It's me.
00:55:36 You're a dad, but like your cool dad, Ben St.
00:55:38 letting you know that you can do some drugs if you want to.
00:55:41 You have my permission.
00:55:42 No, not alone.
00:55:43 Just do them in the house, where it's safe.
00:55:45 Or not. I don't really care.
00:55:47 Get on out there and get those drugs, kids.
00:55:50 He's the cool dad. He doesn't care.
00:55:51 It's all I'm doing.
00:55:51 That's right.
00:55:52 You're the good, the bad.
00:55:54 Don't listen to him.
00:55:55 See, I'm like your dad, but like really,
00:55:57 you know, we're more like friends than like dad, you know.
00:55:59 You never visit.
00:56:00 You never visit.
00:56:01 Like, I'm like, yeah, because I'm like too cool to visit.
00:56:05 Why don't you introduce me to some of your classmates?
00:56:07 They look pretty cute, don't I'm saying?
00:56:08 Hey, yeah.
00:56:09 I can't wait to come to your kindergarten class again
00:56:11 and see them. Hey, yeah.
00:56:13 Am I right?
00:56:14 High five, son.
00:56:19 Anyway.
00:56:20 Moving on from that as fast as possible.
00:56:27 Tell me, tell me more about the experience.
00:56:29 Yeah, I mean, mostly it was me and Zen Huxtable
00:56:33 sitting around listening to music and talking about
00:56:35 tautology and how everything is the same thing,
00:56:40 but also infinite versions of the same thing,
00:56:43 which is basically the conversation,
00:56:46 the one that you have when you're on acid.
00:56:48 So yeah, so that's the one that just kind of goes
00:56:51 around in circles.
00:56:52 Well, yeah, but every conversation does.
00:56:55 I mean, that was the nature of the conversation
00:56:57 was us addressing the fact that the conversation
00:57:00 was going in circles and and and then continuing said circle
00:57:05 for us for because the thing about acid is that
00:57:07 you can't sleep after you take it for like a long time.
00:57:10 Like it keeps you up, it gives you lots of energy
00:57:13 even after the trip is over.
00:57:15 So we're just kind of like standing around talking
00:57:18 about tautology all night long and listening to music.
00:57:22 But we do when we do it together.
00:57:24 This is the second time we've done it.
00:57:25 It's been sort of a cultural exchange where we just kind of
00:57:29 share one another's or share our music with one another,
00:57:32 you know, because he's mostly into like jazz and big band
00:57:36 and stuff like that.
00:57:38 And I'm more into like, you know, psychedelic rock and shit.
00:57:44 And there's a lot of crossover there.
00:57:45 So, you know, I got him into the Mars Volta.
00:57:48 He showed me some cool shit.
00:57:50 And that's basically it.
00:57:52 I mean, there's not nothing crazy or exciting happened
00:57:55 that wouldn't be over the detailed space.
00:58:00 2001, a space Odyssey style.
00:58:02 I saw I saw some cool.
00:58:04 I mean, yeah, I did.
00:58:05 I had I had some fun.
00:58:08 Well, because like the thing is that basically to explain
00:58:11 to anybody who has no idea what acid does to you at all.
00:58:15 And like if you've if you've seen music videos that are like,
00:58:19 this is what an acid trip is like, it's exactly like that.
00:58:21 Like it's exactly what everybody portrays it as.
00:58:26 But like basically how I would characterize it is that normally
00:58:31 your brain is in taking like ridiculous amounts of sensory data
00:58:35 on just everything going on.
00:58:37 But it it doesn't register most of it.
00:58:39 It puts most of it away.
00:58:40 It just focuses on the things that matter.
00:58:43 When you're on acid, it's not doing that.
00:58:46 It's not focusing on things that matter.
00:58:48 It's just taking in everything and it doesn't know what's important.
00:58:51 So if you were to say stare at a wall,
00:58:54 you will notice way more detail in that wall
00:58:56 than you've ever normally noticed.
00:58:58 But because your brain can't like,
00:59:02 it can't necessarily like process all of that at once.
00:59:05 Some of it starts to look weird and fucky
00:59:07 and it's all moving around.
00:59:08 Everything you look at is moving.
00:59:10 Any still image, it's moving.
00:59:11 Everything's moving all the time.
00:59:13 Because you're just like trying to keep track
00:59:16 of all this fucking sensory data going on.
00:59:19 So if you were to have no music
00:59:21 and just be like in a just in a room by yourself,
00:59:25 it would become terrifying because you you know,
00:59:28 you're just like seeing shit fucking happen constantly.
00:59:31 But like if you listen to music,
00:59:33 it keeps you concentrated on the music
00:59:35 and it sort of forces your attention onto something.
00:59:39 So instead of like your attention constantly shifting
00:59:42 and constantly like you know,
00:59:44 paying attention to different things,
00:59:45 it's like it commands you to listen to it.
00:59:48 And so if you listen to really dense music
00:59:50 with lots of shit going on,
00:59:51 you're going to parse every single detail in that music
00:59:53 and it sounds really beautiful.
00:59:55 So mostly we're just sitting there listening to trippy music
00:59:58 and when I would sit there with my eyes closed,
01:00:00 that's when you have the fucking mind visions.
01:00:03 They're like traveling the universe fucking seeing.
01:00:06 I kept seeing like the the like schema of my own brain
01:00:10 is how I would put it.
01:00:11 But like it was like I was seeing my my vascular system
01:00:14 or like the veins in my brain,
01:00:17 but they were all full of pastel rainbows like charging through.
01:00:20 Was it like that episode of Spongebob
01:00:22 where Plankton goes into his earhole and into his brain
01:00:25 and at some point Spongebob just turns his eyeballs
01:00:28 around in his head and looks into his own brain
01:00:30 and sees Plankton standing on it
01:00:32 with a lever controlling his movements.
01:00:34 I have...
01:00:35 Oh, you know what?
01:00:36 I have seen that that episode.
01:00:38 No, it wasn't like that.
01:00:43 Okay, well now I get it.
01:00:44 It sure was, it sure was.
01:00:46 I mean, if anybody wanted to like just to name a music video
01:00:50 that I think encapsulates it perfectly,
01:00:52 the video for When You Die by MGMT looks like an acid trip.
01:00:56 But there's tons like, I mean,
01:00:57 again, it's something that's portrayed in in lots of media
01:01:00 and granted, I wasn't like doing a shitload of acid or anything.
01:01:04 Like if you do a whole lot,
01:01:06 it can get even more out of control as I understand it.
01:01:09 But mostly it's just like everything you look at
01:01:12 is moving all the time and it's trippy and cool.
01:01:17 Fuck yeah, do drugs.
01:01:19 Hell yeah.
01:01:19 Well, you know, they always say,
01:01:22 Sam Harris, the only person I respect who's ever done a drug,
01:01:26 is, he always says that like, it's helpful for,
01:01:31 he's the guy who I first heard a reasonable argument for
01:01:33 that consciousness is an illusion.
01:01:36 And basically that, I forget,
01:01:39 I think it was DTM, MDMT or whatever.
01:01:42 He said it was very helpful for,
01:01:44 like it elevates you above your own,
01:01:47 what's it like, ego or whatever,
01:01:48 such that you are like, yeah.
01:01:49 That is what I think.
01:01:50 I think MDMA, which I'm pretty sure is ecstasy.
01:01:54 Yeah, I think that's right.
01:01:55 You're thinking of the wrong thing.
01:01:56 It's DMT that causes ego death.
01:01:58 DMT?
01:01:59 Yes.
01:01:59 Okay, I forget which one it was.
01:02:01 I don't find that.
01:02:01 Yeah, yeah, you combine the acronyms.
01:02:03 But first of all, pretty smart guy,
01:02:05 and then he did some drugs because he's into meditation
01:02:07 and it helped him be like, yeah, I don't exist.
01:02:09 I'm just part of the universe.
01:02:10 You know, there's nothing special about me.
01:02:12 I am the particles that are part of the universe.
01:02:14 That's pretty cool.
01:02:15 People make a big deal about like-
01:02:16 I don't know why I need drugs for that though,
01:02:17 because like I get it.
01:02:18 Yeah, you don't.
01:02:19 Like, I mean, I feel like,
01:02:21 I feel like you can just understand that concept and be fine.
01:02:25 I knew a guy in college whose name was-
01:02:25 I recommend doing acid because it's fun.
01:02:28 I knew a guy in college named Acid Paul,
01:02:31 who gave me the spiel about DMT and how,
01:02:34 oh, it's like when you die,
01:02:35 your brain is flooded with chemicals and whatever, you know.
01:02:38 He gave me the DMT spiel.
01:02:40 Why don't you just fucking kill me, Acid Jim?
01:02:42 Just do that, and then I'll experience the best high of all.
01:02:44 Death.
01:02:46 Also, you know what?
01:02:47 I don't fucking buy that whole,
01:02:48 when you die, your brain is flooded with chemicals.
01:02:51 How long do you have before you-
01:02:53 What if it gets shot in the fucking brain?
01:02:55 I've got what, like two seconds before I'm just out?
01:02:57 Is that enough time for the chemicals to flood my brain and turn me into-
01:03:00 I think about what the experience of having one's brain
01:03:03 physically damaged and destroyed would be like constantly.
01:03:06 I don't want to think about it, but-
01:03:07 I think about it all the time and freak myself out.
01:03:11 I think about spiders laying eggs in my brain,
01:03:13 and they're just, you know, dealing with-
01:03:16 You know, basically becoming Spider-Man is what I'm trying to say,
01:03:18 and you know, swinging from New York City skyscrapers.
01:03:23 Yeah, they laid eggs in his brain, and now he's turning them.
01:03:25 That's what happened, yeah.
01:03:26 Well, the chemicals flooded his brain,
01:03:28 and he's having an extended, like, flash trip.
01:03:31 That's actually just the moment of his death.
01:03:33 It's only lasted, you know-
01:03:34 It's stretched out like an eternity in front of him.
01:03:36 Yeah, but it's stretched out over, you know,
01:03:37 decades and decades of comic books worth of time.
01:03:40 Indeed, indeed.
01:03:41 The flash, the trip that is.
01:03:43 I want to watch Into the Spider-Verse again,
01:03:45 because it was like the coolest movie I've ever seen.
01:03:47 Agreed?
01:03:48 Good, I still haven't seen it.
01:03:49 Haven't seen it, don't spoil.
01:03:51 You should go watch it.
01:03:52 Hey, speaking of things I've seen, a quick-
01:03:55 Well, I guess this is a tangent now,
01:03:56 but like, I have another subject of interest to me.
01:04:00 But first of all, I have to ask, Tom,
01:04:02 I don't want to spoil anything.
01:04:03 It's about Devil May Cry 5, and it's just about-
01:04:05 There's been like some reveals of things lately,
01:04:08 and I don't want to like say it, if it's gonna, you know,
01:04:10 fuck with things, things about some characters that have been shown.
01:04:14 Any-
01:04:15 Yeah.
01:04:15 Am I- Are you aware of this?
01:04:17 The last-
01:04:17 Do your favorite, say it, so I don't have to.
01:04:19 They aired the last trailer before the game comes out on March 8th,
01:04:24 which is five days from now.
01:04:25 Yes.
01:04:25 I'm very excited.
01:04:26 Okay, and was there a character at the very end?
01:04:30 They showed Virgil from Devil May Cry 3 that he's back.
01:04:37 There, he's coming back.
01:04:38 So first of all, I have no idea how that even happened.
01:04:40 Yeah, I don't really know.
01:04:42 I mean, well, here's the thing.
01:04:43 In Devil May Cry 3, he's like sealed away in the underworld.
01:04:47 That's kind of what happens.
01:04:48 He gets trapped in Demon World, and that's how the game ends.
01:04:51 Spoilers.
01:04:51 Ha-ha-ha.
01:04:52 Yep.
01:04:52 Because you care so much about the story in this game.
01:04:54 The portal between Demon World and Human World had been sealed off.
01:04:58 I was thinking that, yeah.
01:04:59 Until Yusuke shows up and opens the portal, and yeah.
01:05:02 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:05:04 And then in Devil May Cry 1, which comes time-on-wise after 3,
01:05:08 you fight this dude called Neroangelo.
01:05:12 It's revealed at the end of the game that he is what remains of Virgil,
01:05:16 and you, you assumedly kill him at this point.
01:05:19 And you get the other half of the necklace, you make the sword of Sparda, it's fucking sick.
01:05:23 It was so cool, like back in the day,
01:05:26 like beating Devil May Cry 3, and then going back to the first one,
01:05:30 and like having this new appreciation for like, oh, that's fucking Virgil.
01:05:33 It was so fucking ill.
01:05:35 God, what a great game series.
01:05:37 Everyone should fucking play it.
01:05:38 But yeah, he's apparently somehow back in Devil May Cry 5,
01:05:42 looking exactly like he did in Devil May Cry 3.
01:05:45 Who questioned that, Tom?
01:05:46 What, what, Devil May Cry 4 special edition, was he like canonically in that, or was that like-
01:05:51 I don't think he was canonically in it.
01:05:53 Okay.
01:05:53 Because I haven't played it, but I know there is like a cutscene or something,
01:05:56 I think they did for DMC4 with Virgil,
01:06:00 applying that he was in Fortuna at some point.
01:06:03 Yeah, yeah.
01:06:04 I think there's a whole Virgil campaign in Devil May Cry.
01:06:06 I think you can play him in the campaign, because I know they added,
01:06:09 they, like the special edition, they added Virgil,
01:06:11 and then they made Lady and Trish, both playable characters as well.
01:06:15 Um, but I don't know if they have their own campaign.
01:06:18 I know, I know they did something for Virgil,
01:06:20 because everybody has a hard on for Virgil.
01:06:22 Indeed they do.
01:06:23 He's implied to have history in Fortuna, even, and like,
01:06:26 it has something to do with Nero, but it's not clear.
01:06:29 I mean, they think that he's his dad, right?
01:06:31 Yeah, that's like the general idea, but it's not confirmed yet.
01:06:34 So, they're assuming there's going to be obviously more information on that in this game,
01:06:38 because like the whole thing is like, they're like,
01:06:40 oh, Nero's devil bringer arm from four contained Yamato, which was indeed his sword.
01:06:47 And so, in this game, it starts with that arm, that devil bringer arm,
01:06:51 or getting cut off, and he gets those robot arms,
01:06:55 and that's like the gimmick of the game.
01:06:57 So, assumedly, from the very beginning, everyone assumed that Virgil would be involved in somehow,
01:07:02 because of the circumstances of his arm being removed and shit like that.
01:07:06 So, it wasn't like a super big surprise.
01:07:08 I think the bigger surprise of that trailer was that they showed like a flashback with Dante's
01:07:12 mother Eva, and like, implying that they're going to go into like the backstory of like,
01:07:17 how they got separated at birth, and like, what happened to fuck over,
01:07:22 Sparta, and how he got fucking captured and shit and imprisoned, and like Eva got killed.
01:07:27 So, yeah, the trailer went from, like, all the trailers have been like,
01:07:30 just like, this is going to be a fucking goofy, good time action game with your boys.
01:07:35 And then this last trailer, they drop like this emotional bomb, where it's like, no,
01:07:38 like, we're going to get heavy at some point, you're like, oh.
01:07:40 Well, you know what, that's appropriate.
01:07:42 I think so, this feels like they're going to wrap it up.
01:07:45 I highly doubt they'll ever make it.
01:07:46 They should.
01:07:47 Unless, like, this game does fucking amazingly well.
01:07:50 I don't think Capcom's really going to bother making another Devil May Cry.
01:07:53 So, this does feel like, tonally, that they're going to wrap everything up in a nice pretty bow,
01:07:58 and leave it be at that point.
01:08:00 So, well, and I guess we'll just have to see, it's coming out in what,
01:08:03 like, three weeks or something?
01:08:05 Try five days, dude.
01:08:06 Five fucking, it'll be out when you hear this podcast.
01:08:09 Oh my God.
01:08:10 You will be able to see our reactions live on IM Games.
01:08:13 Oh my God.
01:08:14 If the days line up, I'm not sure at this point.
01:08:17 But either has happened or will be happening soon.
01:08:20 Okay.
01:08:20 Now, all that said, very interesting, and I will absolutely play it.
01:08:23 I've played all the other ones.
01:08:24 So, I'm definitely going to play it as well.
01:08:25 Well, except two, I skipped most or two.
01:08:26 Okay, whatever.
01:08:27 You're not alone.
01:08:28 Here's my, yeah, indeed.
01:08:30 Here's my concern.
01:08:31 Can we stop pretending that the characters in Devil May Cry 5 look good?
01:08:36 Can we just look, because look at Virgil.
01:08:38 Look at Virgil here.
01:08:39 Yes.
01:08:40 I put him in the show notes or whatever, the audio links.
01:08:44 He looks great.
01:08:45 He looks like an anime guy.
01:08:46 Okay.
01:08:47 We all know that's 10 out of 10.
01:08:48 And now look how fucking Virgil looks.
01:08:52 Everyone knows he's the hottest character in the whole series.
01:08:54 Just look at his fucking dumbass, realistic shit double chin face.
01:08:59 Hey, his face looks like a foot.
01:09:01 He looks terrible.
01:09:02 He looks like the guy from Third Rock from the Sun.
01:09:04 What's that dude's name?
01:09:06 Anybody know what I'm talking about?
01:09:08 The Joseph Gordon Levitt or like the older guy?
01:09:10 No, the old guy.
01:09:11 I don't even know where they came from.
01:09:13 I don't know where they came from either, and maybe they're fake.
01:09:14 It's this thing they do now where they model the characters after the mocap actor.
01:09:19 Well, that's what they do.
01:09:20 They literally scan, like the models of these in these games, they don't,
01:09:25 it's not like an artist sit down and made them from scratch, like a drawing or something.
01:09:30 What they do is they get an actor and they scan the face,
01:09:33 and they get a version of the bottle, and then they tweak it a little bit.
01:09:37 And it never looks good because there was no artistic direction really.
01:09:41 You came from real life, and real life is always ugly.
01:09:45 Look at Virgil's hair.
01:09:46 Compare Virgil's hair from Devil May Cry 3 to Devil May Cry 5.
01:09:49 It looks like shit in Devil May Cry 5.
01:09:53 It's terrible.
01:09:54 I haven't seen any of these screenshots.
01:09:56 I only watched the trailer, which doesn't show anything but his coat.
01:09:59 And you're like, well, that's clearly...
01:10:00 Yeah.
01:10:01 Yeah.
01:10:01 I didn't see this.
01:10:03 He looks very shitty.
01:10:05 And here's the thing.
01:10:05 Dante, I think Dante looks fantastic in at least this particular shot.
01:10:10 I think he looks dope as hell.
01:10:11 Now, they're still gonna have the horrible, like,
01:10:13 mouth-speaking realistic animation that always looks bad.
01:10:16 But, you know, Dante himself as a character design looks good.
01:10:20 God, what?
01:10:21 Just...
01:10:21 It's just like at the end of Resident Evil 7 where this guy shows up.
01:10:26 Just some guy shows up and they call him Chris.
01:10:31 Oh, it's Chris Redfield.
01:10:32 And you're playing it, and you're like,
01:10:34 like, who is this chinless gump that you are suddenly telling me is Chris Redfield?
01:10:39 He looks...
01:10:39 This man didn't punch a rock.
01:10:42 That's bullshed.
01:10:44 Like, he used to be like a cool-looking, like, attractive, beefy, like a chiseled,
01:10:48 fucking masculine dude.
01:10:50 And now he's like this chinless worm of a human.
01:10:52 He looks like fucking McLovin' with some, like, pubic hair on his face.
01:10:57 It's gross.
01:10:58 He looks like...
01:10:58 It's like a peach fuzz fuckboy.
01:11:00 Okay, I want to know.
01:11:02 I don't know this.
01:11:02 Why are we doing this?
01:11:04 Is it cheaper to do this?
01:11:05 If so, I've got some sympathy for it.
01:11:07 If they don't want to invest in, like, character design, I can...
01:11:10 I think it's the opposite.
01:11:12 I think it's more expensive.
01:11:13 Then don't do it.
01:11:15 Then don't fucking do it.
01:11:16 I think they're doing it for realism's sake.
01:11:18 And realism is the pain of video games.
01:11:20 Throw it in the fucking garbage, my dude.
01:11:22 Because they did the same thing with Metal Gear Solid 5.
01:11:24 They scanned it on its face.
01:11:26 I can't say it's anime.
01:11:27 Why realism?
01:11:28 No, that's no...
01:11:29 I don't...
01:11:30 I guess we're...
01:11:30 I don't know.
01:11:31 There's like a...
01:11:32 There's a sense of, like...
01:11:33 I think developers want the games to be...
01:11:36 Maybe even using realistic actors or, like, real people the way Kojima's been doing recently.
01:11:41 I think they just think they have to.
01:11:44 I think they think that they're not gonna make the profit margins that they want if they don't go all out.
01:11:49 Here's something.
01:11:51 Devil May Cry 5 is running using the Ari engine,
01:11:54 which they developed for Resident Evil 7.
01:11:56 And without knowing how that...
01:11:58 Because it's a proprietary engine, you know?
01:12:01 So by not knowing what the limitations of that proprietary software is,
01:12:06 like, I'm assuming they built the Resident Evil engine for Resident Evil 7,
01:12:10 a scary, realistic-looking game.
01:12:13 So all the technology in there is probably made to deliver photorealistic games.
01:12:17 And if they're using that engine, it's not as easy as just, like,
01:12:21 you know, changing the shaders and stuff to make it look more anime-y or cartoony.
01:12:25 Like, you have a piece of technology designed to make photorealistic graphics and probably nothing else.
01:12:30 Oh my god. Is that fucking guy you just posted, Jesse?
01:12:34 Jesus Christ versus Original Christ.
01:12:35 Yeah, look at this wimp!
01:12:37 What did they do to him?
01:12:38 Oh my god!
01:12:40 Yeah, I know.
01:12:41 And I know we've talked about this exact thing before, but...
01:12:44 That wasn't even, like, a fake reaction.
01:12:45 That's, like, disgusting.
01:12:47 Yeah, they, like...
01:12:47 They literally, like, I don't know.
01:12:49 I guess Umbrella caught him.
01:12:50 They put him in a lab and they sucked his T-Cown out through a straw.
01:12:54 That's the real T-Virus right there.
01:12:56 Oh my fucking god.
01:12:57 And you know what?
01:12:58 I agree with people.
01:12:59 Lady looks pretty good, but I'm posting...
01:13:01 I don't know why they're not fucking loading.
01:13:02 These images of Trish.
01:13:03 Trish has experienced the most massive attractiveness downgrade of, like,
01:13:07 any fictional female I've ever seen in my life.
01:13:10 Yeah, I don't know. I think she was pretty good in both.
01:13:14 Oh, okay.
01:13:15 She's El Goblina in the bottom one.
01:13:17 Okay, maybe this is a bad screen tap.
01:13:19 What the hell is El Goblina?
01:13:20 She's just a goblin.
01:13:21 She's just a goblin.
01:13:21 You mean, wouldn't it be La Goblina?
01:13:24 Okay, fair enough. Fair enough.
01:13:26 That might be La Goblina.
01:13:26 There we go. There we go.
01:13:27 Okay.
01:13:28 People, you don't need to look at any of these screenshots if you don't want to,
01:13:31 but the point is, like...
01:13:34 I hate that we're feeling shackled.
01:13:35 Whatever.
01:13:36 Like, high-profile, like, action,
01:13:38 what do you call it?
01:13:38 Like, quote-unquote character action.
01:13:40 I don't know if that really applies.
01:13:41 Fucking Gaming Brit hates that term.
01:13:44 For, like, there's a lot of focus on, like, the character model,
01:13:47 and you want it to look like good,
01:13:48 and you want it to be, like, special or something,
01:13:50 but why in God's name would you prioritize
01:13:54 looking like a real person in, what, screenshots and stuff,
01:13:58 versus just going for an appealing art style,
01:14:00 an appealing character style?
01:14:01 It's because it's for normies, dude.
01:14:03 I think you're right.
01:14:03 Gaming has been monetized,
01:14:04 and ever since the 360, it's this push for, wow, this is so...
01:14:09 It's like the normal peep.
01:14:11 Video games have become that person on Facebook.
01:14:14 But Devil May Cry 5 is not a normie game.
01:14:16 It's a hardcore...
01:14:17 But it doesn't matter.
01:14:18 Like, again, the technology has to be built around certain feature sets,
01:14:22 and, like, this is what sells.
01:14:24 Like, I guarantee you couldn't make something like, you know,
01:14:28 Toon Link in the RE engine.
01:14:30 Probably doesn't have the foundation to build something like that.
01:14:34 I think this comes down to that whole issue
01:14:36 that everyone's talking about with the AAA market of
01:14:39 needing to constantly make more money than the previous year, where every game...
01:14:44 companies are shit and should be.
01:14:46 Yeah, and, like, it's like they could definitely make a DMC5
01:14:51 where they tone down these graphics.
01:14:53 The game would cost less to make.
01:14:55 And even if it did sell to fewer people,
01:14:58 which I don't even know if that's the case.
01:15:00 I don't know how much people really give a fuck
01:15:01 about these photorealistic graphics.
01:15:04 Certainly not at this level.
01:15:05 But, like, I think that if they toned it down,
01:15:08 even if it sold to less people,
01:15:09 it would still make a profit because it costed less to make.
01:15:13 But, like, I think that they need a higher just number,
01:15:18 like, in order to please the investors.
01:15:20 And I think that they have to make it this way
01:15:23 to show it to those investors.
01:15:25 Like, probably not even about, like, what they think will sell,
01:15:28 but when they show the game to the people that are going to greenlight it,
01:15:33 they have to assure them that it will have these next-gen graphics
01:15:36 that supposedly are necessary.
01:15:39 Because these people are just, like, you know, investors
01:15:41 who just, like, oh, the kids want, like, the better graphics, right?
01:15:45 So we need to give them the better graphics.
01:15:47 So, yeah, I'll keep funding your operation.
01:15:49 I think the normal people do like that, though.
01:15:51 You know, like I was saying, I think it's like the video games
01:15:55 have become the equivalent of that person on Facebook
01:15:57 who will just post, like, look at this really impressive drawing
01:16:00 this random person did.
01:16:02 And it's just, like, a photorealistic apple or something.
01:16:04 And it's like, this blows my mind how someone could do this.
01:16:07 It's the exact same thing.
01:16:08 It's like, oh, my God, graphics look so good.
01:16:11 Um, the most annoying thing is that, like,
01:16:15 I remember when I was playing Call of Duty 4 way back in the day
01:16:19 and, like, thinking those graphics looked really good.
01:16:22 And then I just had this sudden realization that, oh, uh,
01:16:25 all the clothes don't move, even though they're, like,
01:16:28 the game looks realistic and shit, like, none of the clothing,
01:16:31 like, folds or moves.
01:16:32 It's all just sculpted in place.
01:16:34 And from that moment on, all video games have looked horribly embarrassingly
01:16:38 uncanny valley-faced.
01:16:39 Why is it?
01:16:40 Because clothes don't move like they should.
01:16:41 Game developers and 3D modelers have seeming, to my eyes,
01:16:45 completely given up on clipping.
01:16:48 We're just over dealing with clipping.
01:16:50 Forget it.
01:16:51 We're not going to fix clipping.
01:16:52 I was about to say that.
01:16:53 Like, why in current year does any game still clip ever?
01:16:58 They clip excessively.
01:16:58 Because it's so fucking hard.
01:17:00 Yeah, I think it's so hard they've just said we're not going to worry about it.
01:17:04 Like, the problem is that, like, you get clipping issues
01:17:07 from what little I can understand.
01:17:09 Is that they're, the models in video games don't do anything.
01:17:13 They're literally just there to look pretty.
01:17:15 Like, hit calculations all done with hit boxes,
01:17:18 which don't conform to the geometry of the shape.
01:17:22 So you're always going to have issues because, like,
01:17:25 the model itself that you see visually has nothing to do with the collision data at all.
01:17:29 Right, right.
01:17:31 And you know, to the clipping issue, I am happy to just give up on clipping,
01:17:35 as long as the game plays well and is fun and snappy and good.
01:17:40 It's just that I'm holding them to their own standard here
01:17:42 of, like, visual acuity and stuff.
01:17:44 And so, you know, that issue has just gone completely by the wayside.
01:17:47 I think the problem, user end, is that people judge things
01:17:52 not on how good it looks all the time, but how good it looks occasionally.
01:17:58 Like, I think that people see a game and if a moment looks good,
01:18:02 they think the game looks good.
01:18:05 And this, I'll tie this into that JoJo thing that I got in all that
01:18:09 fucking heat for on Twitter, where I was shitting on JoJo for its character designs.
01:18:14 And, like, most people are thinking of it as, like,
01:18:16 but the character designs look great.
01:18:18 Look, I can show you a picture of the character looking great.
01:18:22 And I'm like, well, that's not what that means in animation terms.
01:18:26 It means how well does the character animate?
01:18:29 How good do they look moment to moment throughout the show?
01:18:32 You know, and so if they look like
01:18:34 shit in half the shots, then that's not great character design, you know?
01:18:39 And, you know, and even going one step beyond that, like, this is a video game.
01:18:44 And so, like, we're just comparing Kingdom Hearts 2 versus 3.
01:18:48 Sure, first of all, I think Kingdom Hearts 2 just has a better art style,
01:18:51 but nonetheless, Kingdom Hearts 2 character designs look way better.
01:18:53 And I didn't appreciate that until a Gaming Brits video where he showed footage of both.
01:18:58 Kyrie is so fucking hot in Kingdom Hearts 2.
01:19:01 Holy shit.
01:19:03 Yeah, I agree.
01:19:04 I agree.
01:19:04 And she's not that hot in 3 by comparison.
01:19:07 Everyone looks worse.
01:19:08 She too has become El Goblina.
01:19:10 I mean, La Goblina.
01:19:12 But yeah, there's a good meme of, fuck, it's Shion from Kingdom Hearts 3 versus Kyrie.
01:19:20 It's what it's like, Waifu versus La Goblina.
01:19:22 It's in my video.
01:19:22 You'll see it, everybody.
01:19:23 But anyway, like, Kingdom Hearts 3, just jumping.
01:19:29 Just jump, if you want to jump into a glide in Kingdom Hearts 3,
01:19:32 you have to do, like, a jump, wait till you hit the peak, jump again, wait till you hit the peak.
01:19:37 It feels slow.
01:19:38 And then you can, at the peak of your thing, it automatically gets you into a glide.
01:19:43 In Kingdom Hearts 2, it's like, circle, circle, square.
01:19:45 Bam, you're gliding instantly.
01:19:46 It's fast as fuck.
01:19:47 It's punchy.
01:19:48 It's great.
01:19:49 And it's just this fucking realism shit.
01:19:51 Or it's not even realism.
01:19:52 You can't double jump in real life.
01:19:54 Why can't I just do it as fast as Kingdom Hearts 2?
01:19:56 This sounds like the problem me and Digi were talking about in one of our first
01:20:01 I Am Games videos about realistic versus stylized movement mechanics in games.
01:20:07 And how, like, so many video games chasing realism add, like, anticipation and follow-through
01:20:12 to player interaction, which always slows everything down because you have to wait
01:20:17 for the realistic animation to play out.
01:20:19 Whereas most games play better with, like, sacrificing the integrity of the animation
01:20:26 so that it matches your input.
01:20:28 And a lot of these modern games don't do that.
01:20:29 Like, Digi was talking about, like, when you're trying to turn a character around,
01:20:33 they have to, like, step and rotate on their foot.
01:20:35 Fucking, I'm trying to play through Twilight Princess right now.
01:20:38 And I've literally had several deaths from, like, Link not turning correctly,
01:20:43 because he gets, like, stuck in his animation and will just walk off a fucking cliff.
01:20:47 It's like a transition between states and it's silly.
01:20:50 I was just thinking of, when I was watching you play The Witcher 3 the other day,
01:20:54 there was a moment where, like, you're walking around through all these corpses
01:20:59 and there was this dog that was in the area.
01:21:01 And I saw it just, like, glitch and spaz out and, like, change positions really quick.
01:21:05 And I was thinking of, like, The Last of Us, where I can't believe that in people discussing
01:21:12 that game, no one, well, some people have talked about it, but the fact that Ellie will just run
01:21:17 through areas, like, like, randomly and she'll be, like, clipping through objects and running
01:21:23 around and, like, disappearing and reappearing next to you.
01:21:26 And I'm like, how does this not take anybody out of the experience?
01:21:29 Like, this looks fucking terrible.
01:21:31 Because, Digi, it's fucking baby girl, my baby girl, my daughter.
01:21:38 That's all the people need.
01:21:40 It's like, to me, that means the game looks bad a lot of the time.
01:21:44 There's one video that was talking about that specific issue in The Last of Us,
01:21:48 and I specifically remembered them saying, like, they could have just had Ellie or your other
01:21:54 character wait at the beginning of the encounter, because, like, they're always in a room.
01:21:57 They're like, but that would just be lazy.
01:21:59 I'm like, but it would be so much fucking better.
01:22:02 And you wouldn't have known, like, they can say that, oh, it would be lazy, but that's
01:22:05 only because they've seen this alternative and they don't want to imagine having less.
01:22:10 Isn't it really lazier, though?
01:22:11 It seems, because it seems like you can't do anything at all.
01:22:14 Right, it's not lazier.
01:22:15 But AI is just going to do what it does and we're not going to bother trying to address this.
01:22:19 This person is thinking of that as reducing the amount of things in game.
01:22:24 Like, oh, instead of character moves, character doesn't move.
01:22:28 Ergo, that is less and therefore is lazy.
01:22:30 But they're not thinking about the fact that if it had been done that way,
01:22:34 they would not have questioned it.
01:22:36 It would not have seemed weird at all.
01:22:38 It would have seemed completely rational in the context of the story.
01:22:41 You could have even had a thing where, like, the character will wait or move based on your input.
01:22:46 You could call Ellie to follow you and then you'd have to make sure she doesn't get
01:22:49 fucking one-hitted by these guys as well.
01:22:52 That would be like a whole other level of gameplay.
01:22:54 But let's just have a run around.
01:22:56 I finally remembered.
01:22:57 There was this game.
01:22:58 I had a similar problem when we were talking about a game I actually played.
01:23:02 It was one of the, not story of seasons, what it used to be called, Harvest Moon.
01:23:08 Harvest Moon, I think, a story of two towns or something like that.
01:23:12 And what really annoyed me was this stupid horse mechanic.
01:23:16 I think it was in this game, I might be mistaken.
01:23:18 But I think it was in this game.
01:23:19 You got on the horse and it took a while for the horse to gain momentum.
01:23:24 And I would just never ride the horse because that's such a very cutesy,
01:23:27 simple sort of game.
01:23:29 And why do you add momentum to the horse?
01:23:31 Just hop on the horse and go.
01:23:32 The adding the momentum, it makes it hard.
01:23:34 Because it's such a sort of twitch, I need to only move one block and then stop,
01:23:39 two blocks and then stop.
01:23:40 You know, it's not like a vast exploration sort of game.
01:23:44 It's a very contained sort of map.
01:23:47 So by the time the horse moves, I already need to stop.
01:23:51 And it was so obnoxious and I just never used the horse.
01:23:55 It's just about what your priority is when you're making a game.
01:23:58 If your priority is realism.
01:24:00 Then stop making your game and throw it at the garbage.
01:24:04 I don't know why you would do that.
01:24:06 I don't know.
01:24:06 If there's a fucking, there's a very specific thing you want.
01:24:10 The blue glow I posted of Kingdom Hearts 3 and just like the sheer unbridled horror
01:24:18 when Mickey Mouse came on the screen and I saw what he looks like in this new graphical engine
01:24:25 that they've concocted out of the nightmares of children.
01:24:28 Yeah, yeah.
01:24:29 Like he looks like he looks like something killed Mickey Mouse and is now wearing his
01:24:34 flesh over its animatronic skull.
01:24:37 Like there's like his eyes are like not a part of his body.
01:24:41 Like it's like a weird mask.
01:24:43 Like the the graphics in Kingdom Hearts 3 have the graphics have become better than
01:24:48 the art style ever should have allowed for.
01:24:51 Yes.
01:24:52 Because now everything looks like smooth and like good and it's perfect and porcelain and creepy.
01:25:01 And mostly Mickey like everyone else like Goofy and Donald look okay and Sora looks fine.
01:25:06 I mean and you know it really it looks great.
01:25:09 But Mickey looks like a nightmare from hell.
01:25:11 I don't like how anybody looks and I don't like him.
01:25:14 Specifically from hell.
01:25:15 Specifically from hell.
01:25:16 Everyone the whole game look okay obviously I got used to the Kingdom Hearts 2 art style.
01:25:20 I've been dealing with it for like 12 years now but you know everyone's so shiny.
01:25:26 They're so fucking shiny and you know what I got over it after a while so I'm not even that
01:25:30 upset about it but I do think man it's dumb is my point.
01:25:33 This is the Kingdom Hearts podcast every week.
01:25:37 No we gotta stop.
01:25:38 Let's go to voicemails.
01:25:39 We can stop.
01:25:42 Yeah why don't we get to the fucking voicemails.
01:25:44 We've been going on and on and on but it's I think I'm ready to transition.
01:25:48 Anyway else no anything to say.
01:25:50 Sure.
01:25:51 Yeah oh there is one little thing we have to do before we get to the voicemails.
01:25:57 You know it you love it and let's hear about it.
01:26:01 Okay here's a little remix for you guys.
01:26:05 Not the remix no.
01:26:08 I hate you.
01:26:16 You have to go back to the original.
01:26:21 This isn't how I wanted this to play out.
01:26:23 As you know calling each other gay is the meme way to say it.
01:26:28 Oh wait that's a long one shit.
01:26:31 Fuck the pizza party podcast.
01:26:34 Okay thank you thanks buddy.
01:26:35 So I'm so I just I'm just so you know I'm just so hashtag where's the podcast and I got so
01:26:43 frustrated with it yeah that I that I tweeted you know I tweeted some guy some some random guy
01:26:51 some guy named Nolan I don't know who he is I don't know how I found him you know I was you know
01:26:56 I was just like I just just shot him a tweet like where's the podcast and it was his birthday so
01:27:00 I threw in a happy birthday message but he was too busy celebrating the day of his birth
01:27:05 to tell me where's the podcast and I still haven't found it sounds like I think so I think
01:27:10 I think it might be a conspiracy I'm starting to get scared I think that maybe this is more than
01:27:16 just a subpar podcast I think that this might be an existential threat to us and all that we hold
01:27:22 dear and I'm mad and I'm sad and I'm and I'm depressed and I'm and I'm and I'm and I want to
01:27:32 pass that on to you the viewer hashtag where's the podcast well that's good Ben and luckily we've
01:27:36 got someone I think with a similar story here to back up what you're saying here so let's let's go
01:27:41 over here to a call from pizza party podcast is run by the Clinton Foundation let's see what that
01:27:48 might be about here we go we can only imagine pizza party podcast are they kidding us um excuse me
01:28:00 have you heard of Hillary Clinton yeah I've heard of pizza gate comment pizza cheese pizza
01:28:08 child pizza milk party spirit rituals they're rubbing it in our faces people they can't keep
01:28:15 getting away with this
01:28:24 pizza okay that's enough we can get that right there I think uh we get the idea all right well
01:28:31 what do we do well what do we do with this with this I guess we call up Alex Jones until we've
01:28:36 got a new weapon for his arsenal we broke the case we broke the case what do we do with we've
01:28:40 got a fucking bomb we're sitting on a landmine we've got a new attack vector that we can use
01:28:45 in alliance with the mainstream media to do something I don't know yeah I'm sure we can do
01:28:51 something I'm sure we've got a hashtag do something yeah hashtag do something somebody please hashtag
01:28:57 somebody please hashtag do something okay good I need to digest all this you're right well we'll
01:29:05 revisit this next week serious developments on the on the pizza on the pizza party pizza gate
01:29:11 party podcast front I'm gonna need to prey on this one okay next we got a voicemail here from
01:29:18 max hoving this one's real emotional so everybody please be respectful here we go
01:29:25 um hello members of the bcp my name is max how are you excellent I don't usually do this kind of
01:29:34 but I just wanted to tell you how grateful I am to you guys I recently came out of the closet
01:29:45 and it it's it's very empowering to see you guys just be so open about your gayness somehow I knew
01:29:54 he was gonna say that that's why I wanted to thank you guys have really you guys have really
01:30:01 me come out of my shell all right wrap it up okay and I appreciate that yeah good you got your
01:30:07 chuck a lot of us get out of here um um I was expecting a twist I was expecting him to have
01:30:14 come out of the closet as autistic or retarded or physically had been trapped I don't know if I
01:30:22 believe that guy's gay he needs to let me come over there and suck his dick to prove it hashtag
01:30:28 let digi suck uh we'll we'll get this one going we got to build steam okay next one uh this is
01:30:34 pcp conspiracy zero two uh there was zero one but it wasn't as good so let's hear this one
01:30:42 you know I've just been thinking recently yeah there's absolutely no way for me to confirm
01:30:48 that quote on quote Ben ben saint and quote unquote best guy ever are actually related
01:30:57 in any capacity I've seen no blood tests um that's true they seem to be completely opposed
01:31:04 politically we don't have our citizenship papers I really just don't document it and all the back
01:31:10 stories I've heard about the childhood you know they don't really sync up for me they don't they
01:31:15 don't really add up in my head I'm like hmm oh really huh you know they all sound kind of made up
01:31:23 sort of uh sort of fictionalized like um you know pre-planned yeah I don't know maybe it's just
01:31:32 me what I think that the whole the whole t-bap thing yeah get to the thing it was it was just a play
01:31:38 it was just a ploy like how the white stripes pretended to be siblings when they were actually
01:31:44 married is that true basically what I'm suggesting is that perhaps ben saint and best guy are are
01:31:49 actually um married married that could be it okay I don't know what's up yeah yeah that makes sense
01:31:58 well uh boy well now I mean I don't know can I even prove it can I even prove it to myself no
01:32:07 I don't think so okay well there you go that's it uh I don't know anything anymore untruth debunked
01:32:13 okay I have to say speaking as speaking as the person who was the best man at your wedding I think
01:32:20 he stole a shit I don't think there's any grounds to see it uh indeed let's move on here we got uh
01:32:28 giga dong mcfrank oh wait sorry mega giga dong mcfrank okay thank you I want to be culturally
01:32:37 respective go hey guys sorry if I sound a little weird I've been sick lately and also can't find my
01:32:44 blue yeti anywhere I need help because I recently met this girl and she's totally hot and she's into
01:32:50 me but we don't have the same interests and hobbies like she kind of likes anime I guess but what should
01:32:56 I do if I want to play video games with her and it turns out she sucks at them I'm 21 years old and
01:33:01 I am not a goddamn zoomer I hate cell phones I hate gen 4 pokemon and I fucking hate fortnite
01:33:09 thank you for your educated response um you don't have to have the same interests in her to have sex
01:33:16 with her or hang out and see if like I mean just date her and if she turns out to be boring then
01:33:22 break up yeah right that's fair so wait his his quest he's worried that she's gonna be too much of a
01:33:28 zoomer is that one I think that's definitely a valid concern I think he was saying she might
01:33:32 be too much of a normie for him like he likes he's into anime and video games and she's not
01:33:38 but like whether or not that becomes a problem will become apparent so just go for it that doesn't
01:33:44 work man uh anime and video games will be there forever but you know if if you if if she's the
01:33:50 one that got away then she won't be so uh put your childish bullshit to the side and
01:33:57 get some puss agreed I just no just fucking stay home forget about it if you don't get some puss
01:34:06 you're gonna be a puss every man has a push okay don't worry about it just be a puss ben saint
01:34:17 I'll I'll stand by that uh okay next up science man is calling in no doubt to educate us all
01:34:24 commence question how to get on the pcp voicemail
01:34:31 hypothesis say some weird relatable question then play the piano execution
01:34:41 have you ever tried to uh fuck your hamster but then your penis is too small
01:34:54 is that toho music no it's no game no life opening game well done well done
01:35:04 well yeah I mean well he proved it I don't think he's actually playing piano I think he's just
01:35:09 playing the song no that's probably true he had you hear that like couple of seconds he stumbled
01:35:14 and fumbled to get his way over to the button all right disconnect good job playing or not I don't
01:35:21 know definitely not it's hard to trust people I know that song very well it's definitely just the
01:35:27 song okay fair enough uh I will say though that though the whole uh question into piano thing
01:35:33 while cool is not enough to necessarily get you over the bar because there have been some that
01:35:37 have been skipped when there were too many of them or they just weren't interesting enough
01:35:41 few questions couldn't be improved with a little bit of piano I have to agree with that I have to
01:35:46 background music goes a long way on any of these questions yeah production values
01:35:51 exactly we demand professionalism uh okay now kersh keet man calling back once again go

01:42:00 um well I guess that's it uh did we do it we've done it make an episode we have made an episode
01:42:07 and and that's all there is to say about it I guess look at these texts I found I found uh
01:42:12 yeah I found the texts from last night when I was drunk that I uh sent to my significant other uh-huh
01:42:19 oh boy and it's just like and and there's no response until the very end so it's just like a
01:42:24 wall of outgoing texts and it starts with 7 15 p.m. hell yeah I'll do a good start yeah
01:42:37 7 20 p.m. hell yeah 7 25 p.m. hell yeah 7 35 p.m. hell yeah

01:43:55 but nobody was on to it except me this one person got to witness the bit and I guess you as well
01:44:01 as your own most important critic and now everyone knows about it so thank god the world is aware

01:44:19 shit these days yeah yeah traditional art is it's really good for a spooky art for me I guess
01:44:28 well that's interesting it's really fun you have such a dichotomy of style cool
01:44:33 it's like a slightly more anime version of like a uh scary stories to tell in the dark
