00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome to this episode of PCP. I am Mage and I am introducing everyone
00:00:11 this time for some reason and I am joined by Digi.
00:00:18 Real fag hours every Sunday.
00:00:22 Let's welcome Nate!
00:00:24 Um, guess all majorities. Thank you.
00:00:30 Hey Tom, are you alive? Are you with us?
00:00:34 I am alive. I've been revived from the dead.
00:00:37 Huzzah! And finally, for once, he was not late. Ben Saint!
00:00:43 I, you know, be being late is a meme that needs to die.
00:00:48 That's also true though. That was the old me. He's dead now.
00:00:52 Well, prove us wrong, Ben.
00:00:55 I did. I have been doing so.
00:00:57 Well, one time, yeah, exactly. It could be an outline.
00:01:02 Ben was the most on time for our meetup for the Princess Mononoke film.
00:01:08 That's because of the buses. We already established this.
00:01:11 Serious question, guys. When was the last time I was late for anything?
00:01:16 Tell me. Tell me. Fucking face me.
00:01:18 For your period, you pregnant poor.
00:01:20 Change me up in my face and not online and see what happens, fucker.
00:01:25 What'd you say?
00:01:26 The problem is, Ben, is that your macro ratio of late to not late
00:01:29 is still skewed heavily in one direction.
00:01:31 I know. I fucked up a lot. I fucked up a lot.
00:01:35 But I've...
00:01:35 So what was it, Ben? What would change that made this huge revelation in your life
00:01:39 that you'll never relate to anything again? What was it?
00:01:42 I didn't say I'd never relate to anything again.
00:01:44 Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
00:01:49 I just... I've been pretty good. And I think I deserve money.
00:01:57 I tell you what, Ben, we'll start believing you if you start showing up comically early
00:02:01 all the time. Then that will cancel out the lame.
00:02:04 That's lame.
00:02:06 Almost as lame as being late all the time.
00:02:07 You've cost everyone else by being late. You need to spend that time
00:02:11 by sitting in an isolation cube and doing nothing.
00:02:13 I need to pay back the debt.
00:02:15 Exactly. You've got a big time debt. It has to be paid back. That's what it is.
00:02:19 I see.
00:02:21 Isn't that the plot of that movie?
00:02:22 I wasn't going to say that, too.
00:02:25 Is that true?
00:02:25 Yeah, that's literally the Justin Timberlake movie in time.
00:02:29 In time. That's the one.
00:02:30 Where the entire...
00:02:31 We hit all of the dialogue as time puns.
00:02:34 That sounds awesome.
00:02:36 Well, maybe.
00:02:38 Well, here we are on another episode of PGP, the Pokemon Go podcast.
00:02:42 Thanks for joining us, everybody.
00:02:44 I'm almost level 25. I'm doing real good.
00:02:46 Oh, I'm so close to 30.
00:02:48 I'm so close to 30.
00:02:49 I'm subscribed.
00:02:52 Oh, man. I caught my first Shuckle just today.
00:02:55 I got one of those.
00:02:56 That's a good boy.
00:02:57 I also got a Maulwile in a raid.
00:02:59 It is a piece of absolute trash and completely worthless,
00:03:02 but I'm glad to have it because I love Maulwile.
00:03:04 Yeah, Maulwile rules.
00:03:05 Well, you're over there gathering Shuckles.
00:03:07 I'll be over here gathering Shuckles.
00:03:09 Yeah.
00:03:10 Oh, is that Mad Dosh?
00:03:14 Is that in any way like the pun of Shuckle's name?
00:03:17 Like, other than that, what does it mean?
00:03:19 If it's like...
00:03:20 They're always Shuck.
00:03:21 Shuck, you know, seafood, right?
00:03:23 Like when you Shuck clams or whatever.
00:03:24 Yeah, yeah. Oh, right.
00:03:25 Or like you Shuck corn.
00:03:27 Oh, yeah, yeah, you Shuck clams, too.
00:03:28 What is Shucking?
00:03:31 Yeah.
00:03:31 So you Shuck out the innards, I think, basically?
00:03:33 Oh, no, no.
00:03:34 It's just when you remove the shell.
00:03:35 It's just when you remove the shell from something.
00:03:38 Oh, okay.
00:03:39 So I guess like if you put your mouth, like one of Shuckle's many holes,
00:03:42 and you just suck and you get the poop out of there.
00:03:46 That's like Shuck and Shuckle.
00:03:48 All right.
00:03:49 This is the worst episode ever.
00:03:51 I Shucked some eggs last night.
00:03:54 Okay.
00:03:54 Yeah.
00:03:55 So, all right.
00:03:55 So pretty much my entire identity...
00:03:57 This is what's changed.
00:03:58 This is why I'm never going to be late anymore.
00:03:59 My entire identity has been erased and has been replaced with Keto.
00:04:03 I am all and only a Keto guy now.
00:04:06 That's all there is to me.
00:04:09 So if you liked anything else about me, I'm sorry to disappoint you,
00:04:13 but that's all that's over now.
00:04:13 That is very exciting.
00:04:15 I do want to know more about that.
00:04:18 It's pretty interesting.
00:04:19 But let me tell you, I'm a little embarrassed to tell this story
00:04:23 just because of the names involved.
00:04:25 I made a recipe for some bread substitute.
00:04:28 It is called Oopsy Bread, which is terrible.
00:04:32 I don't like to say it.
00:04:33 It is also called Cloud Bread,
00:04:35 which I find much more aesthetic.
00:04:36 Oopsy Bread sounds like something that would be made out of children's...
00:04:40 Aborted fetuses?
00:04:41 That's where I'm going with that.
00:04:42 Well, okay.
00:04:43 I was thinking more like when kids like shit their pants
00:04:46 and you have those Oopsy underwear
00:04:47 that it's like when you're in transition from diapers up to regular underwear.
00:04:52 I'm trans.
00:04:53 I'm transitioning from diapers to big boy underwear.
00:04:56 That's me.
00:04:57 Pull-ups or pull-ups?
00:04:58 Yeah, pull-ups.
00:04:59 Yeah, pull-ups.
00:05:01 Well, no.
00:05:01 Okay, so Oopsy Bread, AKA Cloud Bread.
00:05:03 I'm going to call it Cloud Bread from now on.
00:05:05 That's way cooler.
00:05:06 Yeah, Cloud Bread is made of, I mean, it's basically eggs and some cream cheese.
00:05:11 Like, it's basically eggs and cream cheese and you whip it up and you bake it.
00:05:16 I assumed it was some kind of like crowdsourced peer-to-peer bread network.
00:05:19 Yeah, we get this from the crowd.
00:05:22 It's peer-to-peer bread.
00:05:24 This is what I'll call it from now on.
00:05:26 The point is though that it sucked ass and it did not just like bread.
00:05:29 It literally just tasted like eggs and cream cheese.
00:05:31 So, I don't know...
00:05:32 Well, that's a pretty good taste.
00:05:33 Like, I didn't like it.
00:05:35 No.
00:05:35 Everyone, everyone hyped it up.
00:05:37 Like, all the keto, it's like a really popular keto thing.
00:05:39 And I was like, wow, there really must be something to this because everyone is into this, this shit.
00:05:44 And turns out it's kind of gross.
00:05:47 So, that was disappointing.
00:05:49 Nate, what about eggs and cream cheese in combination sounds good to you?
00:05:53 My dad always used to make eggs, like scrambled eggs with cream cheese.
00:05:56 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:05:56 Listen, listen, listen.
00:05:57 It's fine.
00:05:57 Like, it's not that the taste was not vile or anything, but like,
00:06:01 baked into like this like fluffy, bubbly, like, like, like a cookie.
00:06:07 I don't know.
00:06:08 It was, it wasn't, I didn't like it one bit.
00:06:10 I didn't like it one bit.
00:06:11 So, I was supposed to use it like bread?
00:06:12 I was like, yeah, I was looking.
00:06:13 I was like, oh, I'm going to make this bread.
00:06:15 I'm going to like put butter on it.
00:06:16 I like put some bread and butter and you know, but, but it's just like,
00:06:19 the thought of putting butter on this like cream cheese is like gross.
00:06:25 No, thanks.
00:06:25 Isn't that kind of the whole conceit of keto though?
00:06:27 Sounds kind of gross because it's just like so much fat and protein
00:06:30 and like no carbs.
00:06:32 I mean, it sounds gross.
00:06:34 Let me tell you about gross.
00:06:35 I have been, I have been drinking, I have been drinking straight heavy cream.
00:06:40 For like a past week.
00:06:42 Christ.
00:06:42 No, that's good.
00:06:43 It's good.
00:06:43 I put, I know it's a keto thing.
00:06:45 I put stevia in it and I put cocoa powder in it and I shake it all up.
00:06:48 You know, your goal is not to just like consume as much fat as possible.
00:06:52 Yes, it fucking is, yes it fucking is.
00:06:56 I am not meming on you right now.
00:06:58 Well, Ben, so you still, you still have a calorie count for the day, right?
00:07:01 That you want to achieve.
00:07:02 That's like the goal.
00:07:03 I mean, I mean, technically, yeah.
00:07:05 Okay.
00:07:05 Okay.
00:07:06 Calorie counts are more of a suggestion.
00:07:07 I mean, the most important thing is to become fat, is to become fat adapted
00:07:12 and enter keto and enter ketosis, which by the way, I am in deep, deep ketosis.
00:07:16 I have been peeing on, I have been peeing on strips and they have been turning
00:07:20 deep, deep purple.
00:07:22 Like you shouldn't need the strips because your piss should smell like a dinosaur
00:07:25 if you're doing it right.
00:07:27 Well, I like the strips because it's very satisfying that they turn purple.
00:07:30 Listen, I am a, I am a fat burning furnace.
00:07:34 I am so deep in ketones.
00:07:36 I am, I am so many ketones that my pee melts bread like acid.
00:07:40 It just, it just tears.
00:07:41 Fantastic.
00:07:42 Yeah.
00:07:42 I am, I'm no longer human.
00:07:44 Guys, I gotta tell you.
00:07:45 I have become keto.
00:07:46 That I also found the answer when it comes to food.
00:07:50 I don't remember if I told the story on a previous PCP because now that they're all
00:07:53 formless, I have no idea what we talked about.
00:07:55 Yeah.
00:07:55 Yeah.
00:07:56 So when, when Ben and DeVu first moved in with me, we, Nate had heavily advised us to use
00:08:03 crock pots.
00:08:04 He was like, crock pots are the answer because you can just put a bunch of shit in it.
00:08:08 Like you just put a bunch of healthy shit, like chicken and vegetables and just leave it on.
00:08:12 And then you come and you eat it and it's just there.
00:08:15 It's around all day.
00:08:16 The problem with the crock pot though is that, A, it takes like eight hours between you making
00:08:21 it and it actually being ready and you probably won't make it until you're hungry because that
00:08:26 inspires you to think about it.
00:08:27 So what would happen is we would make a crock pot.
00:08:31 We'd eat that first, that first glorious go, but then you can't just like let it sit out.
00:08:37 Like you can't turn it off because it'll get gross.
00:08:40 But if you leave it on, it will also get gross because it'll overcook and turn into like this,
00:08:44 this weird mush and no one ever wanted to clean the thing after it was done.
00:08:48 So it would just always be a disgusting mess on the counter.
00:08:51 And eventually we gave up on crock pot because we then discovered deep frying.
00:08:56 And then that was the answer.
00:08:58 So all we did was deep fry chicken all the time, chicken and pork.
00:09:02 We just constantly like, it was all panko, all just, you know, egg, egg or flour, egg,
00:09:07 panko, deep fry.
00:09:08 And that was like every day.
00:09:10 But the problem with deep frying is you can't really make that much stuff in it.
00:09:14 And it all tastes exactly the same because it's just deep fried.
00:09:17 So now I found the real answer and that is steaming.
00:09:21 And I found this answer because of the fact that there's an amazing Asian grocery store near me
00:09:26 that has like basically all Asian food is either noodles or some form of steamed buns.
00:09:32 Like, yeah.
00:09:33 And so I just started getting like all these different varieties of frozen steamed buns.
00:09:38 And all you got to do is just boil water, put them in a steamer and then put a lid on it for like
00:09:44 seven or eight minutes.
00:09:45 And you've got these unbelievably delicious steamed buns of different denominations,
00:09:50 whether it be like wontons or fucking,
00:09:53 You guys are making me hungry.
00:09:55 Like pot stickers, just anything, basically anything could be steamed.
00:10:00 But you know, it's just like a piece of flour filled with some kind of ingredient.
00:10:05 So you just get a whole variety of different fillings.
00:10:07 And now you've got breakfast every day.
00:10:10 And it has been amazing and healthy.
00:10:13 And yeah, it's made my life better.
00:10:16 I have not solved the food question in my life.
00:10:20 Just, it's absolutely a cluster fight.
00:10:22 I've temporarily solved my food question.
00:10:25 Yeah.
00:10:26 Eggs.
00:10:27 I don't like eggs.
00:10:28 So I can't, I love eggs.
00:10:29 I fry eggs, but I also put like, what's the word?
00:10:34 Okay, it's not garlic.
00:10:35 It's onion.
00:10:36 There we go.
00:10:36 Onion and eggs.
00:10:38 Egg, onion, omelette.
00:10:40 Omelettes are great.
00:10:41 I make omelettes all the time.
00:10:43 And they're delicious.
00:10:44 Onions, fried onions turn sweet.
00:10:47 And I love it.
00:10:48 They do.
00:10:48 They're great.
00:10:49 They're great.
00:10:49 Tom's been living with me for a week and a half.
00:10:51 And I have not seen him made one omelette.
00:10:53 And he's claiming that he makes them all the time.
00:10:55 I'm calling foul.
00:10:55 I did, but I have this weird aversion to using your shit.
00:11:00 I want to be as like non-existent in your house as possible.
00:11:03 Well, you're free to use the, I mean, if you use the pan and then you clean the pan,
00:11:07 I will have no idea that you used the pan.
00:11:11 Yeah.
00:11:11 Well, what I've been eating right now is because, again, I was planning on not being in a house.
00:11:16 So I have like, I have a big thing.
00:11:18 Ass loads of fuel.
00:11:19 Yeah.
00:11:20 Protein bars and fuel.
00:11:21 And it's working out pretty good.
00:11:23 I don't even mind it.
00:11:24 It's a good, it's a good solution.
00:11:26 Wait, did you say fuel?
00:11:27 Fuel.
00:11:28 What is that?
00:11:29 It's like soilent, but not soy based.
00:11:31 Oh, oh yeah, you told me that.
00:11:32 It's like a meal supplement.
00:11:34 You just like, it's like, you put some powder, you mix it with water,
00:11:37 and it's got all the calories you need.
00:11:39 And it's nice and nutritionally balanced.
00:11:41 I sincerely want to be post food and consume things like fuel and all that.
00:11:46 The fuel, honestly watching Tom drink it, I'm like, you know what?
00:11:50 If I was a faggot, I would love this.
00:11:53 It's so efficient.
00:11:54 It's so efficient.
00:11:55 And that's the number one thing I care about.
00:11:57 Maybe I'll get into it because I'm wasting time.
00:11:59 I'm starting to be broke.
00:12:00 And so, yeah.
00:12:02 Oh, okay.
00:12:03 Let me tell you, you're gay enough for fuel.
00:12:06 You just don't realize it yet.
00:12:07 Oh, well, I just like to taste things.
00:12:11 Yeah, that's my curse as well.
00:12:13 It's the like the tasting things is, well, that's secondary.
00:12:16 Number one is how lazy I am.
00:12:18 Like I've got eggs in my room right now, but instead yesterday,
00:12:21 I like, I ordered some eggs just like from a place and like they were relatively healthy.
00:12:25 You need to be post food.
00:12:28 This is literally takes like maybe 15 seconds.
00:12:30 That's the way fuel is literally just a powder.
00:12:35 I'm ordering it today, Tom.
00:12:36 I make a solemn fucking vow to you.
00:12:38 I'm buying it today.
00:12:40 I've been talking for a while.
00:12:41 And I think that no one has been able to hear me.
00:12:43 And I'm pretty sure.
00:12:45 No, no, it's fine.
00:12:45 It's fine.
00:12:46 I saved my old audio.
00:12:47 Yeah, I moved my microphone and the cord fell out.
00:12:49 So my old, my first part of my audio is saved.
00:12:52 I have started a new recording.
00:12:53 We'll sync at the end.
00:12:54 I just wanted to let everyone know that I had really great contributions
00:12:57 of this conversation that you will never get to hear.
00:13:00 And I feel sorry for you, viewer.
00:13:03 No, I haven't, I haven't heard you since I talked about deep friend.
00:13:06 So, well, you'll never know.
00:13:10 I'll take the secrets of my brain.
00:13:13 Well, is deep frying still kosher with the keto lifestyle then?
00:13:15 I guess so.
00:13:16 But like the breading, I mean, why would you deep,
00:13:18 I mean, you deep fry for breading, right?
00:13:20 Like there's no point deep frying like just meat or whatever.
00:13:23 So not really.
00:13:23 Although I do make eggs all the time.
00:13:25 I fry them in butter and it's fucking sick.
00:13:29 When my friend Don San did keto,
00:13:31 it was pretty much exclusively either just him like grilling chicken
00:13:35 and just eating that with like, with lettuce or going to like fast food places
00:13:41 and just getting burgers with lettuce wraps.
00:13:43 Oh man.
00:13:43 That was basically his entire time.
00:13:44 When I was in town, when I was in Boston hocking my comics to store owners,
00:13:50 I went to Tasty Burger, which was not the same one that we ate at
00:13:55 when we went and saw Princess Mononoke, but you know, same chain.
00:13:59 I got a Gorgonzola burger on a lettuce wrap.
00:14:01 And boy, it was almost worth it.
00:14:03 It was almost worth it.
00:14:05 It almost cost me.
00:14:07 I'm really shocked, Nate, that you hang out in Fit Boy communities
00:14:10 and haven't heard about this.
00:14:11 But if you go to basically any like, any place that sells burgers
00:14:15 and you ask them to replace the bun with lettuce, they will do that.
00:14:18 Some places even just call it, some place, like if you go to Hardee's
00:14:21 and you just say like, give me a no carb version of the burger,
00:14:24 they'll just like wrap it in lettuce and that's what they give you.
00:14:26 Damn, I should do that every fucking time.
00:14:28 I've been throwing away my goddamn games for nothing.
00:14:31 I found out about it at In-N-Out.
00:14:33 In-N-Out was the first place I went.
00:14:35 So do they replace the wrap with the lettuce or the burger with the lettuce?
00:14:39 They replace the bun.
00:14:40 The bun.
00:14:41 It's no bun.
00:14:42 Imagine if they replaced the meat with lettuce.
00:14:44 Oh.
00:14:46 Disgusting.
00:14:48 That'd be ideal.
00:14:49 It'd be ideal.
00:14:50 And now I want that wrap.
00:14:51 It sounds pretty good.
00:14:52 I like wraps.
00:14:52 Yeah, I'm gonna try one of these.
00:14:53 And whenever I go to McDonald's, I just get a wrap.
00:14:55 Because they're gonna need like the big leafy shit to actually contain burger.
00:14:58 So a thing that I did not know about Keto is
00:15:00 you are supposed to eat protein, you know, like based on your weight or your lean mass,
00:15:05 you're supposed to eat enough protein to maintain your muscle mass.
00:15:08 However, you should not go over that amount because eating protein in excess of that will
00:15:14 become glucose and, you know, basically eating too much protein is basically like eating carbs,
00:15:21 more or less.
00:15:22 So is Keto any kind?
00:15:23 It doesn't sound like much of a muscle gain diet.
00:15:25 I mean, I'm sure you could gain muscle on it.
00:15:30 Yeah, okay.
00:15:30 All right.
00:15:31 Yeah.
00:15:31 I mean, it's mostly meant to make you lose weight like very rapidly.
00:15:35 Like if you're doing it properly, you should burn weight super fucking fast.
00:15:37 The purpose of ketosis is that it is burning fat instead of other things.
00:15:41 So, yeah.
00:15:43 I mean, you probably could gain muscle on it, but I don't think it's like it's not
00:15:47 designed with that in mind.
00:15:50 And that's...
00:15:51 I was doing for a while to lose weight intermittent fasting.
00:15:55 Intermittent fasting is a...
00:15:58 They say like combining that with keto is pretty effective.
00:16:02 And I realized that I just kind of intermittent fasted like without even meaning to for like
00:16:07 much of my life because I just...
00:16:09 Yeah.
00:16:09 Well, that's because you...
00:16:10 What's intermittent fasting?
00:16:11 It's when you just eat like one meal a day, basically, or stuff.
00:16:15 Oh, yeah.
00:16:16 My mom recently mentioned that.
00:16:17 Eat for a day or two.
00:16:18 Yeah.
00:16:18 Well, that's specifically called OMAT or one meal a day.
00:16:21 That's like the hardcore version.
00:16:22 Eating one meal a day is something that I just do naturally some of the time because
00:16:25 I just don't feel hungry when I wake up most almost any morning.
00:16:29 And then like often I just won't think to eat until like late.
00:16:35 I'm a terrible stress eater.
00:16:37 Like when I get stressed, all I can think about is having something in my...
00:16:41 Yeah, that happens to me as well.
00:16:44 Guys, if I'm in a good mood, I can do it.
00:16:46 You know what this episode is making me realize is that we are aging fast.
00:16:51 Yeah, dog.
00:16:53 That's true.
00:16:54 It took you just not to realize.
00:16:56 Well, I'm just thinking about how, you know, the other half of the PCPs, I don't...
00:17:00 Mage, how old are you again?
00:17:01 26.
00:17:03 Okay, so you're my age.
00:17:04 So you got that like creepy question on your cat.
00:17:07 You're asked, what's it called?
00:17:10 Yeah, curious cat.
00:17:11 Like they could have just asked you your age, but they didn't ask you your age.
00:17:14 They asked you, are you a minor or 18 plus?
00:17:19 And I was like, what a creepy way to ask how old someone is.
00:17:23 Well, I want to know the follow-up question before I answer this one, sir.
00:17:28 Yes.
00:17:29 But the rest of the PCP is younger than us.
00:17:34 And so when you've got someone like Munchie on here,
00:17:37 he might be talking about rambunctious fun things.
00:17:40 But when it's all the old fucks, we're just like, I'm dying.
00:17:43 You know what, I'm not eating carbs anymore.
00:17:46 We did talk about Pokemon Go to this day.
00:17:48 You know what, I don't think, but you know who plays Pokemon Go?
00:17:51 My mom plays Pokemon Go.
00:17:53 Well, so does Munchie.
00:17:54 You know, I disagree because Munchie talks about how, you know,
00:17:57 he lives, his body is always aching and he's always in pain,
00:18:01 and about how he and his girlfriend have stopped drinking sugary sodas.
00:18:05 So they're just as old and worthless as us.
00:18:08 But Munchie got a girlfriend.
00:18:11 Oh, this is nice.
00:18:12 We're all decaying machinery.
00:18:13 Munchie has definitely got this old snake condition.
00:18:17 He's just like aging that.
00:18:19 He's probably like physically older than all of us.
00:18:22 So we just don't know.
00:18:22 I mean, he was bigger than me when he was like a quarter of my age.
00:18:28 So, you know, wait, the math doesn't quite check out there.
00:18:31 But you know what I mean.
00:18:32 Munchie being a clone of Big Boss makes a lot of things make a lot more sense to me.
00:18:37 True clone.
00:18:38 He was the one.
00:18:39 He's a clone of a fictional character.
00:18:41 Ridiculous.
00:18:44 Something went wrong in the process.
00:18:47 Hey, I've got a topic to bring up just overall.
00:18:52 I thought about what to call it.
00:18:54 And I have a title for this topic.
00:18:57 And it is simply the Cal Arts Question.
00:19:01 What's to be done about this Cal Arts situation?
00:19:05 And how are we going to stop the influx into our society?
00:19:09 Why don't you lay out exactly what you think the Cal Arts
00:19:13 problem is?
00:19:16 Sure.
00:19:17 Well, it's more of a question because I don't really know if I believe it is
00:19:23 as pervasive a problem as some people think it is.
00:19:26 Is it is it an accurate statement to say that like the the animation industry of
00:19:31 I guess the West, but like America, Canada, etc.
00:19:35 is like coming to be dominated just by specifically the Cal Arts art style.
00:19:40 And is this like squeezing out other options or possibly entirely just through its own
00:19:46 like merit or maybe it's like really easy to draw.
00:19:49 So people really like it.
00:19:50 Obviously, that's the case with like Steven Universe because they fuck up the perspective
00:19:53 all the time and sizes.
00:19:55 I don't have a clear answer for that, but I will speak on behalf of anime real quick.
00:20:00 And just that for the most part, like the vast majority of anime studios are all crammed in
00:20:06 the same part of Tokyo.
00:20:09 And it's just like the area that's like the cheapest to to live in and to have you know
00:20:13 shit set up.
00:20:13 Sure.
00:20:14 But as a result, the anime industry is ludicrously incestuous.
00:20:18 And this is why so much of it is just the same shit over and over again is it's the same
00:20:22 people making it the same people who are teaching the new people how to make it.
00:20:26 And so like I would say that if Cal Arts is just a place where not only are the most popular
00:20:32 shows coming from there, but the people who are learning how to make cartoons
00:20:36 are being taught by those people, you know.
00:20:39 So like that's basically the problem.
00:20:41 Yeah.
00:20:41 And it creates this.
00:20:42 But like it's funny because people will blame like Cal Arts or something.
00:20:47 But it's like if you want to solve this problem, the only way to do it is to build another school
00:20:52 and just teach them something different.
00:20:53 The thing is, though, people have the wrong assumption that like Steven Universe and Gumball
00:20:59 are Cal Arts, but that's not true.
00:21:01 Rebecca Sugar never studied in the Cal Arts.
00:21:05 And if you look at the pilot, her actual art style shows there and it's very different
00:21:11 from what it has become.
00:21:12 And Gumball was made, I think, in the UK.
00:21:15 So it's not even in America.
00:21:17 Gumball doesn't even look like the other shows that I've seen.
00:21:20 First of all, I don't actually know what Cal Arts is.
00:21:23 I just know that there's a bunch of shows that kind of look like Steven Universe coming out.
00:21:27 And to me, it's obvious that it's just because Steven Universe is popular.
00:21:30 No, that's like true because there are things that were out before Steven Universe that...
00:21:36 Adventure Time and what not.
00:21:38 What's that one about the woods?
00:21:39 But Adventure Time doesn't look like the first of evil.
00:21:42 What's the one about the kids of the fucking woods?
00:21:44 Gravity Falls.
00:21:45 Gravity Falls.
00:21:46 Was that before Steven?
00:21:47 Yeah.
00:21:49 Okay.
00:21:50 Yes.
00:21:50 Gravity Falls was Star vs. Was Not.
00:21:52 And then Sans, although not real Sans, just the way that fans draw Sans.
00:21:58 And of course, the new ThunderCats thing as well, you know, very much that.
00:22:01 But to me, it's painfully obvious that it's not about whether or not it's Cal Arts.
00:22:06 It's just shows that are copying the thing that's popular, which all shows have always done.
00:22:11 They're copying the style that's popular.
00:22:13 I mean, it's also just efficient.
00:22:16 I'm sure it's a very efficient way to produce a show.
00:22:18 Right, yeah.
00:22:19 So it's not all that.
00:22:21 It isn't all the anime looks the same.
00:22:24 Well, let's just take it...
00:22:25 I mean, I don't know that that's true, mage.
00:22:27 Well, I'll just believe you that Steven Universe had nothing to do with Cal Arts.
00:22:31 But nonetheless, it is this art style that is called like the Cal Arts style.
00:22:35 And maybe that's completely wrong.
00:22:37 I mean, for a while, there was the Tumblr style, which was like people with fucking
00:22:43 animal crossing, animal crossing goses.
00:22:46 But that was not like, that was not like a mainstream like, that was not like on TV.
00:22:52 I mean, when Steven Universe came out, that was literally why all of us didn't want to
00:22:57 watch it was because we kept saying, oh, it's just Tumblr art.
00:23:00 Like it looks like Tumblr made a show.
00:23:03 And so like to to ascribe this aesthetic to Cal Arts, when it just looks like
00:23:07 what Tumblr was already doing.
00:23:09 And I mean, this is way more pervasive in the world of comics.
00:23:12 Like even before Steven Universe, if you go to a comic store and you just flip through like any
00:23:17 new series, they all fucking look like Tumblr art.
00:23:20 And it's just because, you know, people get in.
00:23:22 Because they're all people from Tumblr drawing, man.
00:23:24 Probably, yeah.
00:23:25 And they all they're all just influenced by each other because it's a very insular culture.
00:23:29 So like, you know, those people just come up copying the designs of other people.
00:23:33 And then they blow up really fast because even though there's nothing unique about their art
00:23:38 style, because it is, you know, piggybacking on something that's already big, they can
00:23:42 blow up really fast.
00:23:43 So we got like all these probably 18 to 20 somethings, like just copying the
00:23:48 style of Steven Universe and writing that wave.
00:23:50 And then as soon as that's not what's in anymore, the ones who have adapted and got their own style
00:23:56 and like are doing something meaningful might have a continued career.
00:23:59 The ones who are just going to look old hat in a couple years are going to fall off the wave,
00:24:03 you know?
00:24:04 What I think is with this is that I feel very similar about these shows that I do with like
00:24:11 3D animation and theaters and stuff.
00:24:13 They all look like Pixar.
00:24:14 And I just I'm just on both fronts.
00:24:16 I'm tired of the sameness.
00:24:18 I just like, we have this, these mediums can do anything.
00:24:22 The aesthetic can be anything.
00:24:24 And we're just, we've like pigeonholed both of these mediums now.
00:24:27 It's a very samey looking shit.
00:24:30 And it's very frustrating.
00:24:31 And I want, I want to do more stuff, especially with Pixar.
00:24:34 Because Pixar has been going on for what?
00:24:35 Like going on 30 years now that it's just been the same shit.
00:24:40 Like please do something new.
00:24:42 And I guess it's just the power of the zeitgeist.
00:24:44 It just has people all wrapped up and they're not, they're just seeing what's working.
00:24:47 That was what made the Lego movie so fucking exciting was that it looked nothing like that.
00:24:51 And it was like, whoa, you can do that?
00:24:53 But how much of this is just the natural?
00:24:56 I mean, like, there's always trends, right?
00:24:58 Like for a while, like, like Disney animation and who's that Don Bluth,
00:25:03 like they, they were the thing for a while.
00:25:05 And now it's, and now it's this, you know, thing trends.
00:25:09 You guys know that the person who made Iron Giant is studied CalArts.
00:25:15 Was that true?
00:25:16 Wait, was that not Don Bluth?
00:25:19 How do you know?
00:25:20 Because I researched it because it was a hot topic.
00:25:23 I said, how do you know?
00:25:23 I meant to say, what do you know?
00:25:25 As in like, oh, well, what do you know?
00:25:28 So ignore that.
00:25:29 That's pretty cool.
00:25:30 I guess, I mean, that was made in what like the early 2000s or like the 90s or something.
00:25:34 I mean, CalArts has been around forever.
00:25:36 So like, they're like the premier animation school.
00:25:39 I mean, I think a lot of people, I think a lot of people who like look at art in general
00:25:49 and like see the same.
00:25:50 And it's like, Vin, Vin Diesel, Vin Diesel voiced the titular Iron Giant.
00:25:57 That is that makes sense.
00:25:58 Yeah, that's true.
00:25:59 He's also the voice of Groot.
00:26:01 Is that how we got the voice for Groot?
00:26:03 They're just like, you can be this like silent only says a few words character
00:26:07 and like give him a fuck ton of money for like saying three words.
00:26:11 You know what?
00:26:13 I know I've told this story before, but just on now that it's Vin Diesel,
00:26:16 it brings a whole new perspective to me and my buddy, John, watch the Iron Giant in college.
00:26:20 I know the story.
00:26:21 And we both just watch it.
00:26:22 It was a real emotional thing.
00:26:24 And it just ended as I look over at him after the Iron Giant sacrificed himself.
00:26:29 And my friend John just looks within intense gaze and pounds on the desk and says,
00:26:32 I feel so sorry for this giant metal man.
00:26:34 And now I'm just picturing Vin Diesel just bursting into flames.
00:26:38 Mate, I think about, I feel so sorry for this giant metal man every day.
00:26:44 I think about that story every fucking day.
00:26:49 What an iconic line, John.
00:26:51 You really did it.
00:26:53 I think that people underestimate how much influence,
00:26:56 like the environment where people learn how to do something like effects what their product is.
00:27:03 The reason Hollywood movies are all the same is because they're all fucking made in Hollywood.
00:27:07 It's the same influences, the same people asking for the same thing.
00:27:09 I understand why it happens.
00:27:11 I just don't like it.
00:27:12 I want to.
00:27:13 Yeah, no, it's unfortunate.
00:27:15 But the thing is that people complaining about it will never change it.
00:27:19 The only way you can change it is by building something different.
00:27:23 Unfortunately, when you do build something different,
00:27:26 it's going to be really hard to make that new thing the zeitgeist.
00:27:30 You can make something new and it's either going to be treated as,
00:27:33 oh, this is too niche to promote to anybody.
00:27:35 So we're just going to bury it.
00:27:36 Or you can be home stuck and just have some insane luck and make something that's totally
00:27:43 unique and distinctive.
00:27:44 And then it spawns its own.
00:27:45 And then there's literally 500 fucking home stuck ripoff web comics,
00:27:49 because it was an influence for this other generation of kids.
00:27:51 There are like tens of thousands.
00:27:52 Again, that wave is over and the only people who survived it are people like Munchie
00:27:56 and who've evolved their art continually to not just look like home stuck.
00:28:01 Granted, Rowdy fucker's cop killer's art is just home stuck.
00:28:04 Everyone says that.
00:28:05 And it is a complete overstatement.
00:28:07 The Rowdy fucker's art style is as multifaceted as the special snowflakes
00:28:16 in the community that contribute to it.
00:28:18 They're each one is a beautiful star shining in the Rowdy fuckers in the acid green sky.
00:28:26 What the fuck am I talking about?
00:28:28 Fuck you, T.C.
00:28:29 I don't know, but that sounds good.
00:28:33 Look, all I know is I clicked one time on the Boru and every single image was like
00:28:38 some Victorian building like with a Photoshop filter.
00:28:41 Okay, that was a bit pervasive.
00:28:44 You know, we took inspiration.
00:28:46 You go with what works.
00:28:50 Why reinvent the wheel?
00:28:51 I guess what I'm saying is that I'm for the Cal Arts style and I want it to stick around forever
00:29:01 because it works and why should we come up with anything?
00:29:06 I think people are making a mountain out of a molehill.
00:29:11 Yeah, I mean, we're just in it right now and I do think this is a natural cycle that'll
00:29:15 probably phase and, you know, out of nowhere, Steam just opened on my computer.
00:29:21 And I think I had accidentally clicked on it at the start of the episode and 30 minutes later,
00:29:25 it decided to just come alive.
00:29:27 Maybe it was doing updates.
00:29:30 Steam's a tricky beast.
00:29:33 You know, I saw an article like yesterday or something that was like,
00:29:36 it was called something of approximately what the fuck has Steam made in the last 10 years
00:29:41 or has Valve made in the last 10 years or something.
00:29:45 And it was like nothing.
00:29:47 And I mean, these people were like mad that Steam like make so much money or
00:29:51 Valve make so much money despite, you know, like not producing games.
00:29:55 I mean, is it not obvious that when they made Steam,
00:29:58 they realized that this was just a way more important venture than making video games?
00:30:02 Like, can these things make Steam better?
00:30:07 Yeah, because the context of this was that Steam is rolling out like an updated chat client,
00:30:14 but it is worlds worse than like Discord or like TeamSpeak or any of the or even Skype,
00:30:20 all the established ones.
00:30:21 It's like, it's super bare bones.
00:30:23 And like, I think this person was just like, Steam, this is embarrassing.
00:30:26 Like Valve, what are you doing?
00:30:28 You're way behind the curve.
00:30:29 This is this is this speaks to something that really fucking frustrates me just in like,
00:30:34 technology and services and stuff in general.
00:30:37 It's like, I really hate how all these companies are like, this is a really popular thing.
00:30:42 We're going to make our own version of it.
00:30:44 Like, I really want to see less copying and more integration.
00:30:49 Like, wouldn't it be great if Steam just integrated Discord instead of having to build
00:30:52 their own version?
00:30:53 Would make perfect sense.
00:30:53 There is some sharing audience integration there.
00:30:57 Like, well, that's all on Discord side, I think.
00:31:00 Like, it's just set up to like recognize games and stuff.
00:31:02 That might be true.
00:31:06 I mean, I'm not just this isn't just Valve like tons of companies do this.
00:31:09 Like when something's popular, we need to build our own version.
00:31:12 It has origins then.
00:31:13 Right.
00:31:13 With origin and then fucking you play from Ubisoft and it's just like, come on guys, come on.
00:31:19 It's just short-sightedness on like I like with the whole fucking origin thing.
00:31:24 It's like, they just thought, oh, we don't want to have to give up part of the the market share
00:31:29 to this thing.
00:31:29 And surely we can do just as good.
00:31:31 But it's like, if you are not going to make it legitimately a better product, no one is going to
00:31:37 want it.
00:31:38 You know, like you, yeah, that's true.
00:31:40 Like if if you have to pay steam or whatever and you're not making as much money,
00:31:44 like it'll be worth it because there will be more consumers.
00:31:48 That's why it's so weird when they when they make decisions like that to me.
00:31:51 Granted, maybe there's some way that even if they have less consumers,
00:31:55 they're making more money.
00:31:56 If that's true, then, you know, it's possible.
00:31:58 Maybe that's what the theory is.
00:31:59 A lot of those games are that are available in origin are also available on steam.
00:32:04 So what's the point?
00:32:07 They want to get their cut.
00:32:09 I mean, EA puts all their new releases on origin.
00:32:12 Like when I got Mass Effect 3, when it first came out, it was only on origin.
00:32:15 It was really annoying.
00:32:17 Inquisition is only on origin as well.
00:32:19 That's the reason I have it.
00:32:20 All I learned since 4.
00:32:21 Like, I don't mind people making new platforms and stuff like that or like making their own
00:32:26 version if they bring something new to the table.
00:32:28 Like GOG, good old games, they have a service.
00:32:31 But it's totally different than steam.
00:32:33 It's for like spotlighting older games that you can't get anymore,
00:32:35 like porting over DOS games and stuff to run on Windows.
00:32:38 And they don't have any copy protection.
00:32:40 So like, if you get something on GOG, you can use it wherever you want.
00:32:44 And like, their client is completely optional.
00:32:47 You can just go to their website and download the EXE and run that.
00:32:50 Or you can use their client to have it all in one place.
00:32:53 So like, it's like steam, but it serves a totally different purpose.
00:32:56 It just takes a steam model and adapts it to a new product.
00:32:59 That's good.
00:33:00 To be fair, this in no way redeems EA in any sort of matter.
00:33:05 Oh no, EA can get fucked.
00:33:07 No, no, I just want to say, I just want to say they do offer free games from time to time.
00:33:11 And that's how I got like Sims 2.
00:33:13 And they had like Dragon Age, the very first one, Origins for free for a while as well.
00:33:18 So they sometimes have some good games and I have like a library full of games.
00:33:22 I'm never going to play on Origins.
00:33:25 That sounds like it's not even a compliment in that case.
00:33:28 By the way, I'm fucking tripping balls because Tom is literally directly above me.
00:33:31 And I can hear him talking when he talks, but I hear him like one second before I hear him.
00:33:35 I can do the same thing with you.
00:33:37 And I'm just like trying not to think about it too much.
00:33:39 Yeah, just roll with it, guys.
00:33:41 Just roll with it.
00:33:42 Yeah, that's all you can do.
00:33:44 Just endure it.
00:33:46 Anybody else got like, I mean, I prepared like a bunch of topics.
00:33:49 I'm just going to roll out on these episodes.
00:33:50 I mean, I could talk about my adventure into Boston's hocking my shit.
00:33:56 Oh, I wonder all about that.
00:33:57 Yeah.
00:33:58 Well, before we even move on though, because that last conversation tied into this long ass
00:34:03 conversation me and Tom had yesterday, just about like the shifting technologies going on right now.
00:34:09 And like which how basically like it seems as though the big companies who like control
00:34:14 everything on the internet are finally starting to get their reckoning.
00:34:18 Like I don't know if you guys heard about like Facebook tried to make some kind of deal with
00:34:22 like China and it fell through and they lost like ass tons of money.
00:34:26 And then you've got like Google who they lost a hundred billion dollars of their net worth
00:34:32 as I recall.
00:34:33 And 20% lost the nation of China.
00:34:37 Facebook.
00:34:37 No, Facebook did.
00:34:39 Yeah.
00:34:39 Which is about 15% of their net worth.
00:34:41 And then Google has been losing tons of money because like the EU is like really putting
00:34:47 their foot down about like, hey, if you're going to record everything that everybody
00:34:50 says at all times, you should you got to tell them that.
00:34:53 And they're like, oh, fuck.
00:34:55 And that's why all these TOS's are changing and shit.
00:34:57 But like me and Tom are talking about how Google, Tom, please reveal what they did
00:35:04 about a month ago to their slogan.
00:35:06 Yeah.
00:35:06 They removed the don't be evil clause from their wait.
00:35:10 Hold on.
00:35:11 Hold on.
00:35:11 There was a don't be evil clause.
00:35:14 That was what they were known for.
00:35:16 Like Google fanboys used to constantly talk about how like their whole principle was don't
00:35:20 be evil.
00:35:21 That was like literally their motto and they removed it from their thing.
00:35:26 Okay.
00:35:26 That's extremely ominous.
00:35:28 But like I thought it was like de facto removed previously or something.
00:35:33 I mean, I don't know what you mean, but it's really funny for that to disappear from their
00:35:37 mission statement.
00:35:37 Now, like Google says an interview now like, well, you know, maybe you could be a little
00:35:43 evil sometimes.
00:35:45 Maybe we don't always mind.
00:35:47 But but we were talking about how like Google used to be like, like back in the late 2000s,
00:35:53 like everything they were putting out was revolutionary.
00:35:56 It was like Google Chrome came out and docs and drive and all this shit that was like,
00:36:00 Oh my God, this is like changing the way the Internet works last revolutionized time.
00:36:04 They did anything in the city.
00:36:07 Yeah.
00:36:08 When was the last time Google came out with like a new thing that you were like, Oh my
00:36:11 God, this is like going to change the game.
00:36:13 And instead, like their services keep getting worse.
00:36:16 And meanwhile, other people are making competing services that are better.
00:36:19 And now people are telling me like, when Microsoft Edge is like a better browser than
00:36:24 Chrome.
00:36:24 And I'm like, I even Chrome is being taught.
00:36:28 What are you doing, Google?
00:36:29 Get your shit together.
00:36:31 You know, I've been trying to get off Chrome.
00:36:33 I've been trying to get off Chrome for a long time because they don't want to be tracked.
00:36:35 Apparently, Microsoft Edge is better.
00:36:37 Or whatever.
00:36:38 Or you don't want to be tracking these Firefox.
00:36:40 Firefox is pretty good.
00:36:41 I use Firefox.
00:36:42 If you want a browser specifically that doesn't track you, there's a browser called Brave,
00:36:46 which is designed, it's designed by Firefox guys.
00:36:49 They like left the company and started their own thing called Brave.
00:36:51 And it has an ad blocker like built in and it has like all these do not track things.
00:36:55 And it's specifically designed to not pay attention to any of your shit.
00:36:59 I do want that.
00:37:01 I hate being watched.
00:37:02 Get it right now.
00:37:02 You Google.
00:37:03 I mean, if you really want to do that, you should get a VPN.
00:37:06 Like that.
00:37:06 That's true.
00:37:07 That's true.
00:37:08 I should subscribe to one of those many fine VPN services advertised to me on YouTube.
00:37:12 This episode of the Procrastinator's podcast is brought to you by Private Internet Access,
00:37:15 the greatest VPN ever made according to like the YouTubers I watch.
00:37:19 That's true.
00:37:19 Oh, and I almost forgot.
00:37:20 In fact, I'm glad you brought this up.
00:37:22 Did you?
00:37:22 Because I wanted to announce that so from now on,
00:37:24 PCB episodes will be exclusively available through our proprietary online download service.
00:37:30 The PC portal.
00:37:33 There you go.
00:37:34 Speaking of the PC portal.
00:37:36 Me and Tom have also been talking about how we need to get the PCP on everywhere.
00:37:41 And what I mean by that, because I think that we've listened to our fans to say things like,
00:37:48 oh, put us on iTunes, put us on whatever.
00:37:50 But like these other podcasting services that exist,
00:37:54 like there's people who just listened to podcasts through those.
00:37:58 So like those people are not in our fan base right now because they have no idea who we are
00:38:02 because they don't use the services we currently are on.
00:38:05 So like potentially we could have entirely separate audiences who know about us from
00:38:10 totally different apps.
00:38:12 And I think that's worth exploring.
00:38:14 It's a good idea.
00:38:14 It's a good idea.
00:38:15 So everybody let us know what podcasting apps we should explore.
00:38:19 Yeah, let us know in the comments.
00:38:20 Seriously.
00:38:21 I mean, I think everyone commenting on YouTube is probably watching us on YouTube.
00:38:25 That's true.
00:38:27 Well, okay.
00:38:28 I mean, that's true.
00:38:28 If you know of any, I guess.
00:38:31 Yeah, I mean, we should definitely be on every platform available to us.
00:38:36 That's yeah.
00:38:37 I mean, there is a diminishing return on investment.
00:38:40 But I mean, it'd certainly be a good thing to just be on everything.
00:38:43 And we could just push a button and do it.
00:38:45 So yeah, let's look into it.
00:38:46 Let's look into it.
00:38:47 Wherever quality podcasts are sold or offered for free or whatever.
00:38:52 Ben, tell me about your comic selling.
00:38:54 I want to hear about it.
00:38:57 Shit.
00:38:59 Wait, I was going to preface it was.
00:39:00 Oh yeah, I was talking about, I talked about it on my Twitch the other day.
00:39:05 Twitch.tv slash St. Comics.
00:39:07 Like, comment, subscribe.
00:39:09 Yeah, high five.
00:39:10 Nice.
00:39:11 High shovel.
00:39:12 So, but yeah, basically, so I had seen on Twitter, someone had tweeted this thing about
00:39:19 how you can sometimes just walk into a store and be like, I have a book.
00:39:25 Will you put it on the shelf?
00:39:26 And sometimes they'll just do it.
00:39:29 So I was like, well, what?
00:39:31 So I was like, what have I got to lose?
00:39:32 So I got, okay.
00:39:34 So I still have maybe like 200 or so copies of the Vapors from the Kickstarter that did
00:39:39 not get sold because I printed a batch of 500 because there was a price break at 500.
00:39:43 So I thought, why not?
00:39:44 Can I have one?
00:39:47 Do you not already?
00:39:49 No, I don't have a Vapors.
00:39:50 Um, give me five bucks and you can have one.
00:39:55 I'll give you five bucks for one.
00:39:56 I'll happily do that.
00:39:57 You didn't fucking kickstart me, you fuck.
00:40:02 Ben, I didn't even know that you, I didn't even know about the Kickstarter till it was like over.
00:40:06 What the fuck?
00:40:07 I knew.
00:40:07 I just didn't believe in you.
00:40:09 It was my problem.
00:40:10 So, you know, that's, that's where I'm coming from.
00:40:13 I mean, do you guys know that it fucking was a massive success that raised like 350% of its original goal?
00:40:19 Yeah, I know that it has cool black envelopes.
00:40:23 Yes.
00:40:24 Well, that's where the fucking pins came from, which I have and I love.
00:40:26 I love my Puba pin.
00:40:27 It's, I have it next to my desk all the time.
00:40:29 Yeah, I've got a bunch of Puba's floating around the house and I don't know like,
00:40:33 I don't even know how I have as many as I seem to have.
00:40:36 Like, I'm pretty sure there should only be one or two, but it seems like everywhere I go, they fucking appear.
00:40:41 Oh, and you know what?
00:40:42 Here's a little thing that can multiply.
00:40:44 Small thing that makes me, that's true.
00:40:46 You know what, I already, I ordered the, the second pin for the second Kickstarter,
00:40:51 which will probably happen in, I mean, later this year, I guess.
00:40:56 I ordered the second kind of pin.
00:40:58 I'm not going to say what it is, but I just got the email notification that has shipped.
00:41:02 And I think it's shipping to our parents house, Nate.
00:41:06 I hope it is a pin of having a panic attack.
00:41:11 That's what I want.
00:41:12 I'll just tell you.
00:41:13 No, it's, it's infinite jests.
00:41:15 The pen is infinite jests.
00:41:16 Oh, okay, cool.
00:41:18 That's great.
00:41:18 It's funny.
00:41:19 It's a joke.
00:41:20 Laugh.
00:41:21 Wait, so Ben, how do you have 200 extra copies?
00:41:24 Like, surely not even 200 people like had bought them originally, right?
00:41:28 Like, how many did you sell?
00:41:29 Yeah, like, it was like 200 something.
00:41:32 Holy fuck, how long did it take to ship all that?
00:41:36 A while.
00:41:36 Oh, man, I took a picture.
00:41:38 Oh, I don't know if I still have it, but I took a picture of the mailing of the receipt that I got
00:41:42 from the post office, uh, for when I went to mail them.
00:41:45 And it is like this long, it is like a huge fucking jumble of paper.
00:41:50 It is like, it is like 12 feet long is the receipt from when I, from when I mailed them all.
00:41:56 It cost me like, it's funny.
00:41:57 It's funny, but it cost me like $700 just to ship everything.
00:42:02 Oh, God.
00:42:02 He is this Christ.
00:42:03 Well, because a lot of it was international.
00:42:05 When I shipped out all the, uh, yeah, when I shipped out all the RADCON stuff,
00:42:09 like they were like, do you want a receipt?
00:42:11 I'm like, it's going to be super long.
00:42:13 No, just email me.
00:42:14 And they did.
00:42:14 But the problem is they emailed me for each individual item.
00:42:19 So my phone just started blowing up because I got 150 emails and quick succession.
00:42:24 Why?
00:42:25 I don't know.
00:42:26 Sending them domestically was about $2 an envelope.
00:42:29 Sending them internet.
00:42:31 Canada was like $4 and everywhere else internationally was like just under $7.
00:42:37 So it was about five extra dollars to ship them internationally.
00:42:40 So on the next Kickstarter, I will probably be like, if you're not in the US or Canada,
00:42:44 you know, $5 postage fee.
00:42:46 I should have done that on the first one, but I didn't think to do it.
00:42:49 Yeah.
00:42:49 There's a thing for that.
00:42:51 Yeah, I had the other way.
00:42:55 God, I really hope, I really hope that that is, that that shipment is headed to our parents'
00:43:00 house and not anywhere else.
00:43:02 But anyway.
00:43:04 The same.
00:43:05 But anyway.
00:43:06 You know, they did just move.
00:43:07 Was it moved to the new place or home place?
00:43:08 Oh, fuck.
00:43:11 Ben, you fool.
00:43:11 Well, I said I waited months ago.
00:43:15 Well, okay.
00:43:15 Okay, okay, okay.
00:43:16 I will.
00:43:17 As soon as this show is over, I'm going to go check in on that.
00:43:20 Ah, motherfucker.
00:43:21 Well, good.
00:43:22 And I'll go get that sweet soylent or whatever.
00:43:25 But the point is, the point is, I googled comic store.
00:43:31 And I picked out a couple that were on the red line or I picked out a couple that were
00:43:34 on a fairly linear route that I could take through the city.
00:43:38 So I grabbed a box of these, you know, these, these extra stock of comics and I put it in my,
00:43:43 I put it in my Sonic Boom backpack, which I have.
00:43:47 Nice.
00:43:48 That was a homecoming present.
00:43:49 It was a homecoming present from a friend.
00:43:52 So I put it in my Sonic Boom backpack and I embarked on a journey and I hit up four stores.
00:43:58 I hit up a store in Davis Square, which I had been to before called Kamikaze.
00:44:03 And they were too fucking hoity-toity.
00:44:05 They were like, we only publish local artists that we, that we're like, we're publishing the
00:44:09 books ourselves.
00:44:10 And I was like, surprise that that is even a thing that they do, but I guess it is.
00:44:16 And they said that we, they said that they would throw, that they would stage a signing
00:44:20 event for me.
00:44:21 Like they, they, they, they do signings for local artists, but I thought I don't really
00:44:25 have the cloud for that to be worth it.
00:44:27 I don't think I would draw a huge crowd, you know?
00:44:29 So I was like, wow, whatever.
00:44:31 Yeah, yeah.
00:44:33 You might be surprised.
00:44:34 I feel like we have a lot of listeners in Boston.
00:44:37 We haven't, I haven't at least one.
00:44:39 We really should try that.
00:44:40 We've got, we should really experiment more with public things.
00:44:42 Like, see how it goes.
00:44:43 And we've gotten a lot of comments to the effect of like, wow, it's really trippy now
00:44:47 that they all live in Boston, like hearing them say the names of all these places that
00:44:51 I pass by every day and stuff like that.
00:44:53 And I'm sure there's a fair, yeah, I've seen a couple of those.
00:44:54 But I was tweeting to complain about how they were fucking like shutting down the roads
00:44:59 for that like cop who died or whatever.
00:45:01 Yeah, yeah.
00:45:01 Those damn terrorists.
00:45:02 Yeah.
00:45:03 Someone was like, yeah, I, like, there's been like news vans outside my work all the time
00:45:08 because I work near the station and like, like in town you live in.
00:45:12 And I'm like, oh, like my fucking people are like right around me.
00:45:16 Like it's probably a fucking someone who listens to the show in my goddamn neighborhood.
00:45:19 All around me are familiar faces, worn out faces, worn out faces.
00:45:25 Digi, well, here, I'll lip and finish this story.
00:45:29 Wait, um, oh, about assigning, I guess like leave a comment or tweet at me if you think,
00:45:36 if you would want to come to like a signing event in Davis Square with me.
00:45:41 I mean, I would do it if I thought people would come.
00:45:44 Um, but anyway, I mean, hey, if Ben does assigning, uh, I'll show up too.
00:45:50 Oh, yeah.
00:45:51 It can come meet Digi, bro and get dents on there.
00:45:54 No, stay the fuck away from my signing.
00:45:57 I don't want people showing up to be like, oh, hey, Ben, where's Digi?
00:46:00 No, I'll tell them that they can't talk to me unless they buy your comic.
00:46:05 That sounds like a compromise I can live with.
00:46:09 I just want you to be at the table with your comic, like comics, and I'll be like 15 feet
00:46:13 behind you in a chair, like wearing sunglasses and just like sipping a latte and like giving
00:46:17 everyone the finger, like, and then like, if, if, if they buy a comic, like you'll like
00:46:22 undo like this little rope and they can go back and shake my hand and I'd like,
00:46:26 well, this feels dirty.
00:46:27 This feels dirty.
00:46:29 No, man, this is business.
00:46:31 I guess this is business.
00:46:31 Get used to it.
00:46:32 You know, I guess this is what I signed up for.
00:46:34 But so, okay, so Kamikaze said no, but we'll do a signing and I was like, okay, maybe.
00:46:39 So then I went to Harvard Square.
00:46:41 Does Kazi have any relation to Kamikaze?
00:46:43 No.
00:46:44 You know?
00:46:44 No.
00:46:45 I don't get it.
00:46:46 No.
00:46:46 All right. Well, how about, how about we split the difference and Tom will be at the signing
00:46:49 with you.
00:46:54 You know, did you two point out?
00:46:56 No, I want, no, I want you all to come.
00:46:57 I want you all to come.
00:46:59 If I do it, which maybe I will.
00:47:00 Maybe I should do it just for fun, just to see what happens.
00:47:02 What if no one, if no one shows up, whatever, it's an adventure.
00:47:06 Yeah.
00:47:06 Just better.
00:47:07 Just have a party.
00:47:08 Yeah.
00:47:08 And then I will tweet that I had a signing.
00:47:10 We'll have to, we'll have to just photoshop it.
00:47:12 We'll have to photoshop a bunch of people into your signing and then post it on Twitter.
00:47:15 Like, this is fucking hot and come get your comic.
00:47:18 You're missing out.
00:47:19 Photoshopping all the greats.
00:47:20 You know, Sonichu, Tails, you know, Winnie the Pooh, you know, the whole thing.
00:47:24 I think I can guarantee you get at least 10 people.
00:47:27 Pooh's Adventures of the Ben St. autograph signing at Comic-Con.
00:47:31 It's like, hell yeah.
00:47:33 And Doug was there and then Tails and he went home.
00:47:36 The Cheeto Man was there, you know.
00:47:39 Knuckles, all the greats, all the greats.
00:47:42 Hatsune Miku showed up.
00:47:44 That was lit, you know.
00:47:45 Comment writer.
00:47:50 Comment writer, a known comic writer.
00:47:52 Every Red Ranger, none of those beta blues though.
00:47:57 So I went to Harvard Square and I went to this basement called Million Dollar Picnic.
00:48:02 And that guy, there was a very nice dude in there behind the counter.
00:48:05 It was a small little hole in the wall place.
00:48:08 And I told him I had a book and he took it and he read through my comic.
00:48:13 And it was very awkward for me.
00:48:14 I just kind of like pretended to look at shelves.
00:48:17 And then a guy came and bought something and he put it down and like rung this guy up.
00:48:20 And I was just like, when's he going to finish reading my shit?
00:48:25 But he eventually did.
00:48:27 And he was like, you know, looks good.
00:48:29 You know, I'll buy a couple and I'll put them on the shelves.
00:48:31 He bought like, he bought three copies for $4 a piece.
00:48:37 I made a whopping $12 from that exchange.
00:48:40 And he said he was going to sell them for six bucks and you know, see what happened.
00:48:44 He said, call back in a while and see if he sold.
00:48:46 And then like the next day, someone tweeted at me outside of Million Dollar Picnic,
00:48:52 holding a copy, presumably one that they bought in there.
00:48:56 So I already look like a real cool guy.
00:48:58 So, okay.
00:48:59 So you obviously couldn't do a signing here because of the fact that there's people nearby
00:49:04 buying your comics and who know who you are online.
00:49:07 There's at least one.
00:49:09 Did you like advertise that or was that an organic purchase that this person just did?
00:49:13 No, I did tweet that I had put my...
00:49:15 I did tweet and I mentioned which stores my shit was in.
00:49:19 So it was not completely organic.
00:49:20 Fair enough.
00:49:21 Fair enough.
00:49:23 So then I went to another place and...
00:49:25 Hey, all that matters is that they sell.
00:49:26 Yeah, pretty much.
00:49:27 That's all you need to convince the people at the place that they should keep buying your comics.
00:49:31 That's true.
00:49:32 Maybe I can sell more than three of the next next time.
00:49:35 So then I went to another place in Harvard Square.
00:49:37 I think it was called New England Comics or New England comic shops or something.
00:49:41 And there was a pretty enthusiastic guy behind the counter.
00:49:44 He was pretty cool and he seemed to like me and want me to get my shit on the shelves.
00:49:49 He took a look and he liked it.
00:49:50 But he was not a manager.
00:49:51 He did not have the authorization to do that for me.
00:49:54 So I left a copy with and gave my contact info.
00:49:56 He said, like, call back in a little bit and we'll see.
00:49:59 And I was like, okay, cool.
00:50:00 So that one's a maybe.
00:50:01 And then the last one I went to the Heinz Convention Center and I went to this place called Comicopia.
00:50:06 And they...
00:50:07 He looked at my shit.
00:50:08 They said there was a guy and a girl.
00:50:10 The girl was like, this is very professionally printed.
00:50:12 It's very nicely printed.
00:50:13 And I was like, cool.
00:50:14 Thank you.
00:50:14 He's like, unfortunately, it's in black and white.
00:50:17 And sadly, that is a problem because things that are not in color, they just don't...
00:50:21 People just don't pick them up.
00:50:22 And I was like, that sucks.
00:50:23 But, you know, was it deliberate choice?
00:50:25 I like the black and white aesthetic.
00:50:27 She said that people complain about manga.
00:50:29 People are like, oh, I can't read manga because it's in black and white.
00:50:33 And I was like...
00:50:34 I mean, literally, Jesse.
00:50:35 Literally, Jesse.
00:50:36 What kind of crowd is this?
00:50:37 What the fuck kind of crowd is this?
00:50:40 What the fuck is a philist?
00:50:41 People who only read American comics, you know?
00:50:43 That's like a weird and bizarre world that I don't understand.
00:50:47 The world of Western comics.
00:50:49 The funny thing is that most Western comics, what bothers me about them is that I hate the colors
00:50:53 because so many of them are like terrible colorists.
00:50:56 Or just like the aesthetics doesn't work.
00:50:59 Marvel comics and stuff in the black and white.
00:51:01 They have these collections where they are on a newsprint and they don't have the colors.
00:51:05 They look so much better.
00:51:06 I personally just...
00:51:07 I personally don't really like the colors because it's just like...
00:51:11 It's too much. It's too overpowering.
00:51:13 Yeah.
00:51:13 Like, it's overwhelming.
00:51:15 I like the...
00:51:16 I love the simplicity of like a simple black and white ink manga panel.
00:51:21 I don't see how...
00:51:22 I don't understand people that can look at that and be like,
00:51:25 ugh, where's all the color?
00:51:28 It's like...
00:51:28 It's like...
00:51:29 You know that drink called Trop 50?
00:51:31 No.
00:51:32 You know that one?
00:51:33 Okay, what it is is it's orange juice with half the calories.
00:51:36 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:51:36 So here's what they did.
00:51:37 They took a gallon of orange juice and they poured water in half of it.
00:51:40 So it's half water, half orange juice.
00:51:41 Well, that's just my age old trick.
00:51:42 My age old trick has been to dilute my orange juice.
00:51:45 So like, they...
00:51:46 Where's my fucking royalties, Trop 50?
00:51:49 After sipping a couple of glasses of Trop 50, if you go, as I've done,
00:51:53 and you sip just a normal glass of orange juice,
00:51:56 it's the most decadent, overbearing, sugary drink in the world.
00:52:00 So it's like that.
00:52:01 That's what the colors are like for me.
00:52:02 I can't handle it.
00:52:03 My baby taste buds can't handle it.
00:52:05 We can't talk about orange juice.
00:52:06 This shit's not keto.
00:52:09 I can feel my insulin spiking as we speak.
00:52:14 I don't think the issue is that the comics are colored.
00:52:17 I just think it's that the way that it is culturally accepted to color comics
00:52:22 in America is obnoxious.
00:52:25 That it's all just glaring primaries and like...
00:52:29 I think it's because there's a guy whose job is to just do colors.
00:52:32 So they've got to like overcompensate.
00:52:35 But I mean, I've seen color comics that look good before.
00:52:39 You know what?
00:52:40 It's weird.
00:52:40 There's a ton of people.
00:52:42 Like, I've been doing the potty cast for a while now.
00:52:44 Like Cucumber Quest, incidentally.
00:52:44 Oh, yeah.
00:52:45 Yeah, yeah.
00:52:45 I like Cucumber Quest.
00:52:46 Cucumber Quest is colored beautifully.
00:52:49 Yeah.
00:52:50 I haven't really read it.
00:52:52 With the potty cast, like of course, one piece manga,
00:52:54 originally all black and white.
00:52:56 But like, there's been a big thing to make the colored manga.
00:53:00 So like, I've gotten a bunch of people into reading one piece
00:53:01 through the potty cast and videos and stuff.
00:53:03 And like, most of them read the colored version.
00:53:07 And it's very strange.
00:53:09 Get it.
00:53:10 I don't get it.
00:53:11 But what is worth the colored version of one piece does look good?
00:53:13 It really is.
00:53:14 It's like drinking.
00:53:15 It's like drinking that pure glass of orange juice.
00:53:17 I'm like, oh, it's just, oh, it's so strong.
00:53:19 I mean, I think that the colored version of one piece,
00:53:22 first of all, I think it works because of the fact
00:53:24 that it's based off the color design of the show,
00:53:27 which is really strong.
00:53:28 And like, one piece is a world that makes sense in color.
00:53:32 Like, I do think there are certain manga where like,
00:53:35 because of the fact that it's like a wacky, crazy,
00:53:38 like everything is audacious in one piece.
00:53:40 Like, it just kind of makes sense to be colored.
00:53:42 I do agree.
00:53:43 Like, one of my comics that I discontinued basically,
00:53:47 like, even Tied Eternal, well, not discontinued.
00:53:50 It's just going to be on a haters for years.
00:53:51 But like, I had to stop it because I realized that I can't color.
00:53:59 And this comic has to be in color
00:54:01 because they're going to travel to all these worlds
00:54:03 and locations and stuff.
00:54:04 And I cannot translate the world without using the colors
00:54:09 because it's so integral to the whole thing.
00:54:13 You know, when I read Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle,
00:54:16 that's the one that comes to mind immediately.
00:54:17 Oh, boy, yeah.
00:54:18 That thing is incomprehensible in the black and white.
00:54:21 It sure is.
00:54:22 And in black and white, like, I just got no sense of like,
00:54:26 feeling for like the worlds that they visited.
00:54:27 Oda's way better at that, doing that in black and white.
00:54:29 I'm sure that the one piece color version is great.
00:54:32 But I don't get needing that.
00:54:34 Like, I think the black, like, the black and white version's fine.
00:54:37 Like, when I reread Scott Pilgrim, like, maybe a year or two ago,
00:54:40 or no, it was more than, maybe like three years.
00:54:42 Geez, I should reread it again.
00:54:45 When, the last time I reread Scott Pilgrim,
00:54:47 I was like, well, there's the colored version
00:54:48 or there's the black and white version.
00:54:49 And I was like, I'm going to, I opted for the black and white version
00:54:52 because like, this is what it was originally made as.
00:54:54 And the colored version is like an alteration.
00:54:57 And I'm sure it's cool.
00:54:58 Every single time I go to the store,
00:55:01 because I've never bought Scott Pilgrim and I want to.
00:55:03 And I'm always just like tearing myself apart over like,
00:55:06 well, the colored version's the one I haven't read yet.
00:55:09 But the black and white version's the original.
00:55:11 And then finally, I opened each one up
00:55:13 to like some specific scenes last time I was at the store.
00:55:16 And I was just like, the black and white is just superior.
00:55:19 Just like, because you can tell, I think the problem
00:55:22 with colorized versions of originally black and white comics
00:55:25 is that like, there are times when the color adds something to it.
00:55:29 And then there's times where like, in Scott Pilgrim,
00:55:34 there's lots of just blank white backgrounds.
00:55:37 And so they replace those with just like blank single color backgrounds.
00:55:41 But that makes it more obvious that they're not in like a realistic location.
00:55:46 You know, like maybe in the manga,
00:55:48 it's just like a guy against a white backdrop.
00:55:50 But now it's like a wall that for some reason is undecorated.
00:55:53 And that seems unrealistic, you know?
00:55:55 Dude, this is kind of like my feelings about like,
00:55:58 just as one example, it pertains to everything,
00:56:00 every like, whatever, like anime or manga to anime conversion.
00:56:05 Like for like the one piece anime, or like any shonen conversion
00:56:09 from the manga to whatever, it's like, in some ways,
00:56:12 like Binksake from one piece is like so much better in the anime.
00:56:17 But like moment to moment, it's like kind of way worse
00:56:20 because it looks like shit and like audio is nice.
00:56:23 It's just paced worse and like it's yeah,
00:56:26 the audio adds something in that in a couple of instances.
00:56:30 But for the most part, it's better.
00:56:31 I mean, I made a video about that way the fuck back.
00:56:35 The the one about soul leader and like how the problem with that translation
00:56:39 was like there's parts where there might be a panel that's like really tiny on the page
00:56:43 where it's just like a little cutaway joke.
00:56:45 But then when they make it the anime, that's like 10 seconds of dialogue.
00:56:48 And it totally kills the pacing.
00:56:51 Yep, that's a big thing.
00:56:53 But to round out my story, so this girl was like, I don't think they'll,
00:56:56 you know, it's too bad they're in black and white because black and whites,
00:56:59 you know, don't go off the shelves as much.
00:57:01 And I was like, well, that's too bad.
00:57:02 But whatever, I can't do anything about it.
00:57:03 And they were like, well, it's well printed.
00:57:05 So we'll they did not buy the copies from me.
00:57:08 They said, you know, we'll take them and put them on our shelves.
00:57:10 We'll sell them for six bucks.
00:57:12 I suggested six bucks because it was what the other guy had suggested
00:57:16 as a reasonable price.
00:57:17 And they will split to 50-50, which is a shitty deal.
00:57:22 50 to the store is a shit deal, frankly.
00:57:26 But whatever, I don't care.
00:57:29 And I was like, fine, if that's the deal, then I'll take it.
00:57:31 We'll do it.
00:57:32 And then I left.
00:57:33 And then someone tweeted at me.
00:57:37 They bought it from the other one.
00:57:38 And it was pretty cool.
00:57:39 So now I have seven.
00:57:40 I have seven copies out in stores.
00:57:43 And at least one of them is sold.
00:57:45 And I will probably go into town again
00:57:47 because there are plenty more stores that I did not hit up.
00:57:49 I hit up four.
00:57:50 And there's at least a dozen.
00:57:51 I'm excited to hear about this plan, Ben.
00:57:53 Because it would be very easy for us
00:57:57 to make some kind of multi-tier deals around this area
00:58:00 with these comic shops.
00:58:01 Like if everyone is going to end up around here,
00:58:05 imagine if we had some kind of PCP package deal
00:58:10 where we'll promote them and they'll host different comics
00:58:14 and things that we create and do art signings.
00:58:19 That's an incredible idea.
00:58:22 Yeah, but I don't think we're big enough for them to really care.
00:58:25 I honestly think that because it's Boston, we are big enough.
00:58:29 Because I mean, consider the fact that Ben was saying
00:58:31 that there's local comic stores that are big enough
00:58:36 that they literally publish local artists,
00:58:38 which means that enough people are invested
00:58:40 in buying a completely unheard of local artist.
00:58:44 That they will sell enough to make it worth publishing for them.
00:58:48 So we already have pre-established fan base.
00:58:52 So it's not like we're building out of nowhere.
00:58:54 We already have fans in Boston.
00:58:56 And if those fans created a culture from these stores,
00:58:59 if people knew every Saturday we're going to be at this comic store,
00:59:03 then you build a community around that.
00:59:05 Right, and here's the thing.
00:59:07 Like these stores, their social media presence
00:59:11 is like a fraction of what ours is.
00:59:14 So especially if they have online sales,
00:59:18 there's big gains for them.
00:59:21 PCP has a swinging...
00:59:24 In terms of when people look at the PCP channel
00:59:27 and say things like that it doesn't have that many subscribers or something,
00:59:31 it's like you're comparing it to the entirely wrong thing.
00:59:34 Yeah, it doesn't have that much subscribers
00:59:36 for a YouTube channel in competition with big YouTubers.
00:59:39 16,000 subscribers to the average human being
00:59:42 sounds fucking insane.
00:59:44 Like if you tell a small business,
00:59:46 yeah, we have the poll of 16,000 people.
00:59:49 It's like, oh, that's the population of this town.
00:59:53 So I think there's a lot that can be done with that.
00:59:57 Not to mention the weirdness of the PCP
00:59:59 and that almost all of us have more
01:00:02 poll in the individual things we do outside of the PCP itself.
01:00:06 I mean, imagine if I did that signing
01:00:07 and say like 10 people show up to it.
01:00:11 That's 10 people that like...
01:00:13 That's 10 real people who maybe had never heard of this store
01:00:17 coming to it for the first time
01:00:18 and maybe buy in some stuff and maybe be coming, repeat customers.
01:00:23 And to a little mom and pop shop that kind of thing.
01:00:26 When we were hanging out with Ben...
01:00:28 When we were hanging out with Econ and Zen Huxable,
01:00:32 we went to Newberry Comics and May spoke to someone there like,
01:00:36 hey, this guy's a famous anime YouTuber.
01:00:39 Can we strike up some kind of deal with you guys?
01:00:41 And they were like, oh, well, you got to contact our office
01:00:45 and they gave us like a card.
01:00:46 She tried calling them but never actually got an answer
01:00:49 because they were just like not in the hours, I guess.
01:00:51 Oh, yeah, I stopped at Newberry and they seemed very like...
01:00:56 They didn't seem...
01:00:56 The thing is, Newberry is a chain.
01:00:58 Newberry was super popular.
01:00:59 Newberry is a chain and it's very FYE-esque.
01:01:01 But I'm thinking now that because...
01:01:03 Because I've noticed that there's Newberries all over town.
01:01:06 Like, they're pretty common in Boston.
01:01:08 So that means all the other comic shops are in competition with Newberry.
01:01:12 Which means that if we can give them anything
01:01:15 that would be a pull for them to compete with Newberry,
01:01:18 that would be really attractive to them, you know?
01:01:22 Let me tell you why selfishly this plan sounds great to me.
01:01:27 It is because I have long felt like some sort of weird comics pariah.
01:01:33 Like a guy who makes comics and makes his living off of doing comics
01:01:37 and yet has like basically no connection to like other people who do that.
01:01:43 And sometimes I wonder, sometimes I wonder about like the comic scene, right?
01:01:48 Like breaking into that scene and being a part of that community, right?
01:01:53 And I wonder about it.
01:01:55 You don't want it.
01:01:56 It's awful.
01:01:58 The funny thing is I completely relate to that because of the fact that
01:02:02 I hate all the anime YouTubers.
01:02:04 And so I have always felt like a pariah in that same way.
01:02:08 Because like, so many of them are about the sense of community.
01:02:13 Like they just want to be in the group called anime YouTubers.
01:02:17 And so they just do what everyone else in that group does.
01:02:20 And like, I'm not really interested in that.
01:02:23 Like I just want to make my shit.
01:02:24 And I would prefer if everyone in the group was doing something different.
01:02:28 Which is why I love the PCP so much.
01:02:30 Because we're like, none of us are quite doing the exact same shit.
01:02:33 So it's like we always have, we're not really in competition with each other.
01:02:37 We're just people who are, you know, taking a similar approach to our career path.
01:02:41 You know, I have had mixed feelings about it.
01:02:43 Because sometimes, sometimes I feel like a weird pariah.
01:02:46 And I think, boy, if only I were part of some kind of like community
01:02:49 that would like support what I do and like help promote my shit
01:02:52 and like, you know, have mutual interest in common
01:02:55 and face the same kind of struggles and all that.
01:02:57 But then sometimes I see, sometimes I see like on Twitter
01:03:02 or in like various discords that I joined and then never looked at again.
01:03:06 I see this community, I see the people, you know, communicating
01:03:11 and the attitude is like foreign to me.
01:03:14 The attitude is like hyper positive and like hyper supportive
01:03:18 and like very like hug boxy.
01:03:21 And I'm like, I'm shuddering in my chair.
01:03:24 I mean, like I said, Ben, in the last like five, 10 years,
01:03:30 every time I go to a comic store and I pick up something I've never heard of,
01:03:34 it has Tumblr art.
01:03:35 When I pick up your book, it has nothing of the sort.
01:03:39 And I really think that like, again, it's people wanting to be a part of a click.
01:03:43 They get into drawing comics because they want to be in a positive community like that.
01:03:48 And I think that you are someone who is as an outsider to that.
01:03:52 You're just someone who independently came to the conclusion of comics with no,
01:03:56 you know, no motivation behind it to like make friends on that basis.
01:04:01 And now you're like, well, surely I can make friends on the basis of what I'm already doing
01:04:05 because surely someone else does comics and feels this way.
01:04:09 You know, that's kind of how I felt when with my anime channel is like,
01:04:13 surely, like I'm not doing this to be a part of the anime community,
01:04:17 but surely I could form an anime community out of people who feel the same way about anime I do.
01:04:22 I mean, with this question, one should really, I think about this a lot,
01:04:26 you should lead your life with your values out in front ahead of you.
01:04:31 You shouldn't like be aiming to join a particular group.
01:04:34 It should be like, do the thing that you're passionate about or whatever that is,
01:04:38 and then like, absorb the community that gathers around you naturally.
01:04:43 Because those will be the people who are like, yeah, exactly.
01:04:46 Which I feel like is what I have done.
01:04:48 I feel like I have more or less lived by that, by that ethos.
01:04:52 I think, same here.
01:04:53 For me, I think the PCP entirely has lived by that,
01:04:56 but for me, it's just a matter of we gotta build it bigger, you know?
01:05:01 True.
01:05:01 It's like, we've built it and they've come,
01:05:04 but what if we could build it even bigger and even more of them came?
01:05:07 Or what if we built it to be even better for them,
01:05:12 and they left everywhere else that they were?
01:05:14 You know what I mean?
01:05:15 The PCP is gonna make them all come.
01:05:16 I hear y'all loud and clear.
01:05:17 Man, imagine that is my ultimate goal, to make everybody come.
01:05:20 Imagine if we could become like a legitimate cultural force in like the Boston area.
01:05:25 What a dream.
01:05:25 I think we could.
01:05:26 What a dream come true.
01:05:26 I think it could happen.
01:05:28 I am here to fucking lead the new type takeover of Boston.
01:05:33 God damn it.
01:05:35 We need Munchie and his foot shoulders marching in the streets
01:05:38 to enforce the law of the land.
01:05:39 We gotta burn this place in the ground.
01:05:44 So that's pretty much all I have to say about that little escapade.
01:05:48 I will probably do more of it soon.
01:05:52 I mean my results were pretty successful.
01:05:54 Discounting new grounds, which I did not really expect to make any headway.
01:05:58 I was successful at two out of the four and one of the-
01:06:02 You mean new grounds or newberry comics?
01:06:03 I'm sorry, I mean newberry comics.
01:06:04 Yeah, yeah.
01:06:05 Yeah, I did not expect to make any headway there because they were so corporate.
01:06:09 But yeah, two out of the four local shops that I went to accepted my shit
01:06:13 and one of the ones that didn't is still a maybe that might pan out anyway.
01:06:16 So, you know, I'd say the results were-
01:06:19 That's really, that's great ratio.
01:06:21 That's incredible about success.
01:06:22 And you know, I don't care about selling them.
01:06:24 I don't care about selling them.
01:06:26 But I care about having them on shelves and I care about-
01:06:28 Okay, okay.
01:06:29 Here's what I think, right?
01:06:30 I don't think I'm gonna move a ton of product this way.
01:06:33 But I don't care about that because the people that do find it in this way
01:06:38 are gonna be people who are really passionate about comics, right?
01:06:41 Like people that are like into this medium and those people are like invested.
01:06:46 And someone like that stumbling upon my work and being like,
01:06:50 oh my god, this is a new guy who I've never heard of before
01:06:53 and his work is different from everything else that I've read.
01:06:57 And I connect with it.
01:06:58 Like to get, like, you know, even just a handful of people having that reaction.
01:07:03 Like that's what I'm after.
01:07:05 And I think that this is a great way-
01:07:06 I absolutely think the type of people who will go to the local published shelf at all
01:07:12 are that type of people.
01:07:13 Yeah, yeah, that's what appealed to me about doing it.
01:07:16 Not the thought of moving a ton of product,
01:07:18 but the thought about potentially reaching like, you know,
01:07:21 the hardest of core of audiences potentially.
01:07:24 You know, it's funny, Ben.
01:07:25 Back when I, before I became a YouTuber,
01:07:27 I was making this magazine called The Virginia Beach Hermit Society.
01:07:31 And my plan was that it says on the cover that it's free
01:07:34 and I was just going to just leave it in like Barnes & Noble.
01:07:38 Just like leave it in random places and see if people would take it.
01:07:41 Which apparently is how the band TV on the radio,
01:07:45 their first like mixtape album or whatever was called OK Calculator.
01:07:50 And they said that they pretty much did that.
01:07:52 They just like printed off a bunch of it
01:07:53 and would just like leave it all over their campus and shit
01:07:55 or just like in CD bins and stuff.
01:07:58 And just like hope people would find out about them.
01:08:01 There are some stores just have like zines.
01:08:04 Like people just leave zines and stuff.
01:08:06 Like there's a crepe shop in Davis Square
01:08:09 that one time I just like picked up some zines.
01:08:11 They just had some fucking zines sitting around at like the front shelf.
01:08:14 Any of them good or interesting?
01:08:18 OK.
01:08:20 I don't remember.
01:08:22 It was nothing remarkable but you know.
01:08:24 Yeah that's the sad thing about it is that like again
01:08:27 it you always have to consider the culture
01:08:28 because it's like if you put it in a zine rack
01:08:31 but all the other zines are totally different from yours
01:08:33 then it's like well the kind of people who would come to this rack
01:08:37 are not the kind of people who are going to read my zine you know.
01:08:42 Making zines is a popular thing.
01:08:44 A thing that I don't quite get.
01:08:47 Is there any profit to be found in making those?
01:08:49 Are you talking about zines?
01:08:50 Didn't we argue about this last time?
01:08:51 Didn't me and Munchie get in a fight?
01:08:54 I was not there.
01:08:55 Yeah he wasn't Munchie calling it.
01:08:56 I have never heard the word zines before.
01:08:58 What are you talking about?
01:08:59 I haven't heard zines.
01:09:00 It's obviously zine because it's short.
01:09:02 Yeah because it's short for magazine.
01:09:06 No one says magazine.
01:09:07 Well zines sound cooler.
01:09:10 No it sounds dumb.
01:09:12 You sound dumb.
01:09:13 Oh good one.
01:09:14 That's yes.
01:09:15 Well done.
01:09:17 I'm proud of you.
01:09:20 Yeah am I crazy or last week didn't me and Munchie argue about this exact same thing?
01:09:26 I don't remember.
01:09:26 No okay well anyway.
01:09:28 I don't even remember if I was on last week.
01:09:29 A lot of people who draw comics make zines and I don't quite get why.
01:09:35 I guess the idea is to make like a really short work that you can like put places but I don't know.
01:09:39 There is a group.
01:09:40 There is a group in Boston called.
01:09:41 I'm just obsessed with magazines.
01:09:43 There is a group in Boston called the Boston Comics Roundtable that I before I moved away
01:09:48 I would I would most weeks I would attend these meetings and people would like bring their latest
01:09:54 pages of their shit and post them up and critique each other and they had like a
01:09:58 they had like a group sort of like publication that people would do their own comics for and
01:10:03 contribute to but a lot of people that were at this thing made zines and I was like huh zines you
01:10:09 say and then I never even considered making one of my own because why.
01:10:15 Ben if you ever do consider that get me involved because I'm obsessed with magazines.
01:10:19 Maybe it will.
01:10:20 Just I grew up with them you know.
01:10:22 Okay the reason the reason I think in my head I read it as zines is because like all of the
01:10:27 like one syllable words with like four letters like a fine line time.
01:10:32 Sure.
01:10:33 You know.
01:10:33 Yeah if you say if you saw it alone without.
01:10:35 But etymology for magazines.
01:10:36 It has to be related to magazine.
01:10:39 It's probably you're probably right but like it doesn't read that way in my mind and it's just
01:10:44 like it is just a big error message in my head I cannot make it as.
01:10:47 You're right English is wrong.
01:10:49 Yeah that's fair I can accept that pretty much.
01:10:52 Let me tell you let me let me tell you my secret shame let me tell you my secret shame.
01:10:56 I have been meaning to go back to that Boston Comics roundtable again because I used to
01:11:01 enjoy it quite a bit and I have not done it yet and I well the reason doesn't
01:11:08 make any sense and it's terrible the reason is and here's my fucking problem guys and I'm
01:11:13 prepared to be judged for this.
01:11:15 I'm judging myself I'm too fat and I'm too ugly and I don't want to leave my house
01:11:20 and I don't want anyone to see me.
01:11:22 Oh god.
01:11:23 What's the competition like there though.
01:11:25 What's the are these are these the much lookers that are going to look down on you for no
01:11:30 fatness and your hideous body I just I thought that anyone would in the first no no I just
01:11:34 I'm like I'm just like I could be.
01:11:37 Yeah sure I sure I wouldn't be the ugliest guy there but I could be 20 pounds thinner
01:11:43 and I could have my beard back and wouldn't that be a better first impression to make.
01:11:47 I can relate to that.
01:11:48 Yeah you know what you should do Ben is you should start going out in public and then
01:11:52 use the shame that you feel over not being better to make yourself.
01:11:56 Oh but I have oh but I have done that I mean that's that's a good job that's
01:12:00 hence the keto hence the keto lifestyle.
01:12:02 Yeah well you know going out going out getting out of the house getting out of the house
01:12:06 really helps with motivation to like improve yourself.
01:12:10 Yeah.
01:12:10 If you're sitting at home and doing nothing all the time it's like well what do I even
01:12:13 have to to work towards what's the point.
01:12:17 Yeah nothing you'd be in a waistoid if you're living that when you have when you have more
01:12:21 of a social life and you have like things that you go out and do it's like all the other stuff
01:12:26 all this all the beneficial stuff it's like you just kind of want to do it more you have
01:12:31 more reason to want to like eat right and and not and exercise and and you know not.
01:12:38 It's like when you like when you go out to like do something and you feel physically
01:12:45 weak it's definitely like you know when you when you're just like getting healthier for
01:12:49 the sake of itself it's just like well why but then when you like try to do something you
01:12:53 want to do and you can't that's when it's really like okay like yeah and I gotta say motivation
01:13:00 is such a powerful thing because I have been trying to like talk myself into like going hard
01:13:07 on making more money because I need to like to live in the house I live in and pay my taxes
01:13:14 but uh but it wasn't until Tom yesterday informed me that there are now like 16 core processors
01:13:22 that you can buy for like $800 that will like rip through render times that I finally actually
01:13:27 started putting the effort into making more money like it was not the like financial freefall that
01:13:33 did it it was the wanting to buy an expensive new computer that did it for me so well hey
01:13:41 there it is classic motivation getting them 16 cores stand funny to make money
01:13:46 no I think that was the mistake I was making uh like a few months ago is that I was like trying
01:13:52 to like spend more money to make money and now I'm like no I'm not at that point in my career
01:13:57 yet I've at the point of my career still where I can make way more money by not paying anybody
01:14:02 by like just doing everything myself and just not being a lazy fuck each and every one of us
01:14:08 lies without a question on the precipice of utter financial ruin it could easily happen
01:14:13 but like if we any of us got sick uh like it's over it's fucking what do you mean by sick like I
01:14:20 mean well you know let's say you um you you got I don't know you get some sort of like
01:14:25 fucking long-term illness oh yeah I guess cancer or something extreme one oh you're saying like if
01:14:30 we had to like spend a shitload of money over getting sick that's what I'm saying I could not
01:14:34 afford kick cancer treatment does anyone in this group have health insurance at all oh I have health
01:14:39 insurance through my job currently I live in Europe oh yeah that's right yeah so she's all right
01:14:44 I still I have you saying Ben I still not gotten on Massachusetts health insurance even though it
01:14:50 was one of the main things I was looking forward to doing when I got back here Ben do it today
01:14:56 look come on Ben you gotta join me in the bottom rungs of society leaching off you don't have health
01:15:01 insurance here yeah yeah oh oh how I love paying my oh well this may get your revenge for those
01:15:07 really terrible by the way but it's free that's socialized medicine for you this is the closest
01:15:12 I'll ever get you can see a doctor and what more do you want yeah yeah yeah he'll look at you
01:15:18 tell you to get out and that'll be that uh when are we gonna have free when are they gonna make
01:15:25 free technolized limbs I just want to have like a robot where is transhuman oh why is it not god
01:15:32 wait I have to share the terrible tragedy that occurred in my life guys guys you lost an arm my
01:15:40 oculus rift oh okay okay I think the rift itself is fine I think it's just the cord I think it's
01:15:48 the cable oh god okay because because the headset connects to the computer with a cord that splits
01:15:54 it splits into an hdmi and a usb and the usb connector works but the hdmi or hdmi connector
01:16:03 it will not it says that it's not connected and I don't know the headset if there's a problem with
01:16:08 the headset okay it's not a problem with the computer because I have plugged a monitor into that hdmi
01:16:13 port and it has worked so it's not the computer so it is either something with the headset or I think
01:16:19 more likely it's something is wrong with the cord so I looked into replacing the cord
01:16:23 and this single cord okay you can buy one from the manufacturer from the oculus of
01:16:29 manufacture free whopping $50 so I'm like fuck that so I head on to amazon right right I head on
01:16:36 to ebay and I look for this cord $150 for just the cord uh wait yeah I'm like so that is the
01:16:45 maybe that'll make any fucking sense like what but why would you buy a proprietary cord why would you
01:16:50 buy it I don't know I I guess maybe uh that doesn't make any sense like an hdmi cable is like two
01:16:56 dollars well it's an hdmi split with a with a usb and you know actually come to think of it the um
01:17:03 the uh the headset port might be proprietary so oh you're fucked you're fucked I mean I guess
01:17:09 $50 isn't that bad hey we're at hour 20 let's do music god damn it yeah all right I guess we'll get
01:17:17 to my topic no no no do you want to do it yeah we now it's okay I've hogged I've hogged the
01:17:24 conversation this whole time I well today was benz day and the next day will be major's day no I
01:17:31 mean I'm actually pretty okay I like with our format there I mean I have many topics prepared
01:17:36 to talk about and uh and I think we know you know see see I'm really bad at coming up with topics
01:17:42 so I brought a topic today but we didn't get to use it so I won't have to come up with a second
01:17:47 topic next time yeah there you go there you go I mean I I quite like that uh I feel all right robbed
01:17:55 this was this is a ben episode I quite enjoyed it frankly yeah I I had fun listening I'm sorry I
01:18:01 didn't know this is gonna be the ben episode cancel it basically it cancel it judge it appropriately
01:18:07 viewers you came on time you talked a lot about interesting things you didn't get in shape uh
01:18:14 twitter twitter.com slash it's also ugly patreon.com slash ben saint uh
01:18:20 uh
01:18:22 by my books in the real world in the real universe wherever quality comics are sold
01:18:30 Ben what you need to do is when you get your Ben when you get your oculus rift fixed we need to
01:18:35 make a virtual comic book store that's just your book so you can buy oculus rift oh no there's a
01:18:41 plan there's a plan you can watch movies on the oculus rift sure yeah I mean I don't know how
01:18:48 they're not like set up for that though it's just like a screen floating in front of you yeah
01:18:53 that you can look at like it's in 3d space but it's a 2d screen floating in front of you but
01:19:00 but you can make it huge I guess you can that's like that's true how is that an improvement from
01:19:07 real life it's not see the thing that gets me the thing that was the most disappointing about the
01:19:11 oculus rift is that the the screen like the granularity of the screen is just not small enough
01:19:18 and it it just doesn't feel like it never doesn't feel like I'm looking at a screen you know like
01:19:25 you can you can tell it's a screen because you can see the pixels I can tell by some of the pixels
01:19:30 but I haven't seen quite a few shoops in my day that's a meme well I mean be that as it may it's
01:19:36 our only IRL portal to the actual rift cafe so by Christ then you need to get that fixed so we
01:19:43 can access it please let's start talking about the music before we end up in the rift cafe
01:19:49 all right all right here we go oh just a hashtag hashtag pcb themes everybody you still got at
01:19:57 time of hearing this you are out of time by the time you have heard this but by the time of recording
01:20:02 it you've got two days ends the 31st or the three days so uh so you will have heard this last time
01:20:08 so you know so there you go so there you are we but we're done by the time you're hearing this but
01:20:11 here's here's our here's our shit all right first one here we go it's from at pelvis esli uh what does
01:20:18 you have to say uh Felix a cover of the original song by at footwear man uh might not fit the bill
01:20:24 completely but I made it so listen to it god damn it uh and it's called uh pod castinator
01:20:30 all right pretty good robo thing yeah like pretty good make sense and here we go
01:20:45 I'm supposed to be working right now I'm supposed to be working right yeah
01:21:00 myself
01:21:13 I think the lyric is don't want to do yeah yeah I think it changed it up change the
01:21:16 lyric that was nice it was nice I did not hear it because the pop was muted for me and I don't
01:21:22 know why well let's fucking turn it up beige is your problem I managed I managed to like I
01:21:29 managed to unmute it but like that's when it ended so I didn't hear anything I'm so sad I go back and
01:21:35 listen to it and I thought that the tone was pretty pretty spot on was it an improvement the only
01:21:41 problem with that one is I don't know if it's better than the one that I was gonna say is it an
01:21:47 improvement on the original I'm not sure yeah I feel the same it's pretty chill I think it's a good
01:21:53 cover I definitely think that's one of the ones that like we should use first like just something
01:22:00 for something like an outro or I don't know yeah yeah it's it's oh yeah it's definitely worth using
01:22:05 for something yeah I like that a lot nice work Felix uh all right next one all right this is a
01:22:12 big one this is a big one so our boy oblivion fall who's made a bunch he made those hardcore rocking
01:22:17 ones oblivion yes uh uh did you guys see his tweet when he was like telling the story about his
01:22:23 name that was a cool story oh you should check out the twitter van he made a little video explaining
01:22:29 his name because like devu was giving him shit for it being possibly associated with scott and
01:22:35 that's skyroom oblivion would I find it on the on the tpcrastinator's twitter yeah but yeah we
01:22:42 retweeted it it makes him feel any better I never associated his name to any of the elder scrolls
01:22:48 games you know so there you go when I think oblivion weirdly enough the first thing I think of is the
01:22:54 kingdom hearts keyblade that is a good one that's a good one that's the best in fact uh but so last
01:23:02 week was his meme theme this week is his dream theme so damn uh this is this is an important one
01:23:09 so let's uh get right the fuck into it wait was there any notes here he just said uh
01:23:15 to hear my music played by real instruments is so surreal many thanks to at azariah and mayd for
01:23:22 lending your voices and thank you sam madman for the sin is this a fucking like supergroup
01:23:27 collab or something I don't know what sounds like if this is a dream come true he says holy
01:23:33 shit well all right with all that said let's fucking get into it here you go oblivion
01:23:39 i'm supposed to be working right now i'm supposed to be working right now but i love working
01:23:49 i'm doing nothing my take i'm jerking unless i'm talking i am an asshole i am a stupid
01:23:56 yeah
01:24:03 um man it's been a while since i heard any brony metal but uh that took me right back yeah uh it's
01:24:09 it's weird it's weird to hear it in like it's sung in such like in such like an earnest such an
01:24:15 earnest way these these retarded right up bro it's a singer or something you know oh that's really
01:24:22 so wait was that really he said it was real instruments but the drums did not sound real
01:24:27 well maybe they weren't oh i mean maybe that part wasn't i don't know i don't know
01:24:33 he said it sounded like tech drums with guitars over it it reminds me very vaguely of um the band
01:24:41 slovonics slov i don't remember how it's pronounced uh oh gosh he's supposed to
01:24:49 it just reminds me a lot of the the old ye old brony days when everyone was like making metal
01:24:54 covers of the songs where it was like tech drums and just like shredding guitars with like brony
01:24:59 lyrics over it you know yeah here we go okay dream theme oh by the way it was called don't
01:25:06 want to do it uh it was a name i i mean that was dope as hell and i'd love to use it for something
01:25:13 i just don't like it's i'm looking for a new theme you know i i mean i mean i feel like an
01:25:18 asshole but that was awesome like yeah ultimately it is i don't know if heavy metal makes sense for
01:25:24 this shows intro like this is not like an explosive show it's like two hours of like a bunch of people
01:25:31 talking you know yeah oh man by the way i'm looking at his entry on on his soundcloud he says uh my
01:25:38 second entry to the pcb theme competition i've been writing music for years this is the first time
01:25:42 it's been realized with true instruments gang that's made with surreal and expensive process
01:25:46 that put me wait that put me out by over two hundred dollars but it was worth it my god he's got an
01:25:53 instrumental version as well what about that cost that was like a 30 second song how did that cost
01:25:57 two hundred dollars he hired musicians to sing and stuff he hired musicians to sing and probably
01:26:01 played guitar friends who could do that like damn i mean if you don't have friends who play music
01:26:06 who play guitar or sing or something like anybody can be your friend if you give them enough money
01:26:11 that's right he's fucking hired set musicians or some shit basically i feel like there's gotta be
01:26:16 someone you can hire on fiverr to do that for you i mean i have paid i have paid people for
01:26:22 well i mean i don't feel bad because like he got it made and we played it on the show and like we

01:26:34 really want to like go on like i feel really bad it's just that like i don't think it's like the
01:26:38 theme i'm looking for but i actually loved it and i want to use it for stuff because it was
01:26:41 fucking dope okay okay question i didn't like it no well there you go he hated it um what do we
01:26:48 what's the protocol okay so like how how do we go about using other like other songs from this
01:26:57 contest for stuff well i mean one thought is that we use them as outro okay but can we just can we
01:27:04 do that like are we allowed to do that i we did say at the very beginning that the thing was like
01:27:10 we were playing to just use these so only submit if you're comfortable with like us using that
01:27:13 stuff okay so i mean if somebody disagrees with that let me know but i'm pretty sure that i didn't
01:27:19 realize those were like the explicit terms we did mention that okay we'll double check that for
01:27:25 so everybody's cool but i mean yeah if you're not cool with him just let us know yeah and i mean
01:27:30 yeah yeah like we'll credit the song any anytime it's used obviously certainly uh all right let me

01:30:01 something and the kids would just simply spasm out all these high-pitched tones would like emanate
01:30:06 throughout the room feel like this is this is talking about some kind of magical tone that

01:32:05 strong strong contender yeah that was really strong right there it delivered on the title for
01:32:11 sure okay but like that's true you guys did say you didn't want heavy metal i would consider that
01:32:19 to be hardcore punk which is much more the aesthetic of uh i like i like i think i've said this before
01:32:26 but i like that it's got it's got original lyrics that are like about the show yeah and i like i dig
01:32:33 that right i dig i just like that it has that really rough aesthetic which is more like to do
01:32:38 like the cleaned up like tech drums or all the the electro like we've gotten a lot of electronic
01:32:44 music and i just don't really feel like that matches the tone of what this show is which
01:32:50 is like a bunch of people who make outsider fucking weird abrasive art you know yeah yeah
01:32:56 so yeah i feel common i i do i do really love it though
01:33:02 i word all right we got one left for today from at jack is boy simply called uh oh wait it's

01:34:13 we can't really oh no i don't care oh whatever mage is 20 seconds long it's 2018 mage doesn't

01:34:53 incredible all right that's it for today everybody for the for the themes do we have fan art are we
01:34:59 looking at fan art or do we do we ban fan art do we ban fan art do we ban fan art yes we ban for life
01:35:05 okay okay you know what we do you know what we do we look at the fan art on the next on the next
01:35:10 draw cast the next draw cast we will do a fan art round up and we will look at it there uh not the
01:35:15 next one next next right right well yeah because we've already filmed the next one yeah yeah so two
01:35:20 draw cast from now uh so only only two months to wait to get your precious uh no no no no all right
01:35:29 whatever it was figure out we've got we've got some good questions in here uh we do we actually i
01:35:35 i want to start with giffy's because i'm interested in hearing you guys's response uh does someone
01:35:40 being an artist automatically make their criticism more valuable in your eyes no no absolutely not
01:35:47 100 no you could be okay you know what artist i mean the fleet and utter retard it's totally the whole
01:35:53 picture that i would say the inverse that someone not being an artist doesn't make their criticism
01:35:58 less valuable but like being an artist or whatever like it could imply that you just have more information
01:36:04 and inside than like you know if they're a good if they're a really good artist i might be more
01:36:10 inclined to believe that they know what they're talking about okay but like it depends on if i
01:36:14 agree with the criticism yeah yeah you know like criticism right if you're talking about like i think
01:36:19 that like criticism is subjective i mean an artist a fellow artist might criticize something
01:36:27 and then i might take advice on how to change it like like maybe this artist could advise me on like
01:36:33 technique right because this person might know about technique but the fact that he knows techniques
01:36:38 that might be involved in this do they don't make his opinion about it more valid they don't
01:36:42 they don't make him more qualified to say that he does or does not like it yeah like as well like
01:36:49 it depends really like if you have a vision or everything you really want to do and the artist
01:36:54 is unaware of that and he might advise against it and and you know like for instance like ben said
01:37:00 like you know he printed it in black and white and that's that was his vision that's the way he
01:37:04 did it on purpose but then like some artists can come around and say like oh don't do it in
01:37:09 black and white that's you know bad or something you know maybe this is a little bit of a tangent
01:37:14 but i just like i think this has been on my mind a little bit you and i think tom as well but i've
01:37:18 definitely seen you liking posts like this what is the deal with the protect like the protectiveness
01:37:25 around like people drawing your oc's like doing shit that like you wouldn't canonically have like
01:37:32 i don't understand the world that this is coming from i've never retweeted anything like i don't
01:37:37 remember no okay okay oh that's some bullshit okay maybe didn't retweet but i saw it liked i've seen
01:37:43 this many times which is why i'm bringing it up no like this protectiveness of oc's no no no the
01:37:48 only thing i like to retweet in regards to art is about art theft that that's i don't about oc's
01:37:55 like i got i swear was today this was fucking today i saw that you had liked a post that's
01:38:01 well if you just don't agree then fair enough i've been playing a tale of two towns harvest moon
01:38:07 all day i i don't know what you're talking about okay maybe this was yesterday but okay mage the
01:38:12 real point is do you have a problem with someone drawing one of your oc's doing something you
01:38:19 didn't want them to do um how about having sex for example that seems like an obvious one
01:38:26 hold on let me think about this is like the thing is like it's it's i've been sort of on the fence
01:38:33 about this thing and that's why i'm sure i never liked or retweeted anything because i don't have
01:38:38 like a very solid opinion about this oh on one hand i don't really mind but on the other hand
01:38:45 like if it's for instance like my character mage right and she's meant to be me and someone draws
01:38:51 her having sex with their sona that's gonna creep me out like oh hell but if they just do like
01:38:58 i guess that makes sense but if they just you know draw like a tasteful lude of my oc which
01:39:04 actually has happened once like it was yeah i saw that yeah it was i loved it it was it was great
01:39:10 the art was fantastic i really like how they drew the back i know it's very weird but i like the
01:39:14 detail on the back name backs are hard to draw are the nate are you maybe thinking of this thing
01:39:20 mage retweeted it and it is a thing about like don't trace people's art and don't don't post
01:39:26 trace no no no no okay i mean i saw that too that's a very different thing uh and i mean
01:39:32 you know that was kind of an interesting question too people were going back and forth on that like
01:39:36 somebody had done i guess just since we mentioned it somebody had drawn like a picture of uravity
01:39:41 from from my her academia and then like i retweeted that one that's right that was a different one
01:39:46 but nonetheless and then somebody had done like you get they took a picture of their drawings they
01:39:50 had definitely by the way well sure sure but somebody had just like probably traced but they
01:39:57 say that they freehand drew and you could see it was on a piece of paper like the exact same image
01:40:01 you can't print out the original image and trace over it by putting a new sheet of paper on top of
01:40:07 it well don't yeah what if she did what if they did freehand draw it what if they didn't act what if
01:40:13 they didn't literally trace because she did they did credit the original they absolutely did say
01:40:17 they credit the thing was nobody believed that she drew it freehand for first of all as permission
01:40:22 yeah like it's so one-on-two one that like it doesn't matter that you freehanded at that point
01:40:28 if you could have freehand if you have the ability to freehand it like that then why copy it one
01:40:34 for one like no see i think that it doesn't make any difference whether they traced it or freehanded
01:40:42 honestly uh because i mean they're still drawing it they're still recreating something else's art
01:40:48 but i don't know i don't i mean i think if you say like yeah this is a recreation of this art
01:40:54 like what more do you want like what what the specific the specific criticism the the person
01:41:00 the person credited with they said like reference at this person they said that it was a reference
01:41:05 that's not like a trick that's good enough no that's not no i've been i'm gonna fight you i'm
01:41:11 gonna punch you no if they say reference at this and you look at that and it is like the exact same
01:41:17 image well like duh like duh that's not a reference that's like copying is there anything
01:41:28 different about this image that you guys are talking about and you can see that it's the same
01:41:34 image it is a it is an admission that yeah i copied this image but they see reference that's the thing
01:41:41 but they copied it entirely the reference that made me so cement exactly is your poli please
01:41:47 articulate your particular grievance made just so i understand what don't you like about that okay
01:41:51 a reference is like you take something and you and you just like build upon it it's kind of like a
01:41:57 base like i don't know how to draw a hand i look at a picture of a hand it's like oh okay so that's
01:42:01 that's like that's specific pose of a hand that i want to draw and then i draw it myself but it
01:42:06 looks different it looks in my style it's it's mine now like i just looked at it for reference to
01:42:11 see how a hand looks like that's a reference maybe a pose or something like that like if you if you
01:42:17 put like those pictures next to each other you can see the differences you can see them like oh yes
01:42:22 it's been referenced but the artist has made it entirely their own thing that's fine that's a reference
01:42:28 i'm actually not against tracing when it's done for like when you're trying to practice and stuff
01:42:33 i used to do that too sure but you don't post it and be and put your watermark on it i don't
01:42:39 know mage would if you if you if this person had said that they traced the image exactly they said
01:42:44 a reference if it said traced would that still be a problem yes but no it's one to one copy of the
01:42:51 drawing and i have issues with it like what are people not allowed to build upon it and made it
01:42:55 their own i would have not had so much like me i'm saying that's crazy it's crazy i don't i gotta just
01:43:01 profit involved in this in any way because like they did they got a lot of likes they got a lot of
01:43:05 likes yeah more so than the original one well that's not their fault that's true that's not their fault
01:43:11 yeah i mean i would blame the consumer base for that but like in the age of social media it's like
01:43:16 sure sure i just i don't think it makes any sense let time speak i was just gonna say i was just
01:43:26 gonna say you had like renaissance master she did studies and copied paintings verbatim
01:43:31 i'm like baby that was a known thing to do so if this person admitted that like this is a study and
01:43:36 they essentially said that because i linked back to the original it's the same thing i don't see any
01:43:39 issue there it's just like yeah i copied this i'm you know if they have okay the person the person
01:43:46 said very specifically that they referenced and people challenged them they're like whoa you clearly
01:43:50 traced this and the person's like they said no i did not trace this i drew this my and maybe they
01:43:55 were lying but they said no i told i totally believe that they freehanded it i don't think it
01:44:00 makes okay okay i need to have to i'll need to i'll need to take the both images and then like
01:44:08 look at them and and like layer them over one for one to see because like i just don't agree with
01:44:13 your i do not believe in the ability to freehand it so what what why well there's people who do that i
01:44:20 mean there's people who sell counterfeits of like you know famous paintings who literally
01:44:25 can just recreate them because it's just about studying the the i mean people it's about studying
01:44:29 what they did and then just doing it again i mean people can do like photo realistic sketches by like
01:44:35 using a photo reference and they can sketch it with like perfect photo accuracy well if they had
01:44:41 that such talent then why copy someone else's it's because it's a totally different skill set
01:44:49 you know it's like saying oh you can copy a photograph perfectly well why copy the photograph
01:44:53 because the entire point is to copy the photograph yeah well then copy the fucking
01:44:58 i don't know i i'm just i'm having issues with taking someone else's art and recreating it
01:45:03 like i like one for one if it was built upon if it was made different i would argue that very much
01:45:08 so okay i i think that okay i think that the recreation is worse than the original but i
01:45:14 think you could argue that it did build upon it because it like it's colored differently right
01:45:19 oh jeez it's a little bit okay so they made the colors i mean that's no different from like
01:45:25 just taking a meme and giving it a new caption like you're just it's just the same art that you've
01:45:30 been like an EU is trying to criminalize memes because they're copyright violations Jesus Christ
01:45:35 is that true yeah that's true yeah oh fuck the EU all right let's move on to the next question
01:45:40 uh all right all right mage uh you've been thoroughly dabbed on uh okay okay like i i i do
01:45:46 want to say like okay guys i do see your point however i it's it's it's something that we don't
01:45:53 have time to thoroughly discuss but i i do see your point so i'll i'll give you that much mage i i
01:45:59 think i i more or less understand where you're coming from and i feel a similar sort of like a
01:46:03 version like why don't you just draw something new but i i struggle to find any particular infraction
01:46:07 yeah i just i guess i guess like if i saw someone else doing this to my art i would i would feel
01:46:13 devastated honestly i if if i just feel like i feel like this person got less likes it would not
01:46:20 be a problem but if someone sold yeah if someone was trying to sell a copy of my art i would be
01:46:25 upset like is it like permission if i i would i would i would i would have absolutely no issue
01:46:32 if they had permission and the artist was okay with them doing that then you know then that's
01:46:38 then that's personally that that's the artist is it you know stands and i'm not gonna you know
01:46:45 tell them how to think or is it is it kind of is it kind of sad and maybe frustrating that you
01:46:50 know this this copier got you know so much more recognition for their copy than the original
01:46:55 did yeah but i don't that's not even my issue but i don't think they did anything wrong i just i
01:47:02 can't nothing that what's done anyway the next question is from Kajorah Bitterthorn
01:47:07 and it is how's your next big project shaping up on track or hit a snag cough please how they
01:47:13 marketed ETA uh how they market it is is episode one's like basically done like uh it's just i have
01:47:20 to add in certain shit and it is just not a financially viable decision to finish that video
01:47:28 right now i know where you're at dog i feel you big time because there's like the how they marketed
01:47:34 series was basically developed way back when i was after i made how uh we have accepted mediocrity
01:47:41 and i was on my like oh i'm gonna make some big huge epic thing that's like world stopping but like
01:47:47 the thing is it will be niches fuck and most people will not give a shit about it like it's
01:47:52 gonna be something that is mostly appealing to me and even though the first episode is like mostly
01:47:58 done so i mean i will wrap it'll probably come out you know it'll it'll definitely come out in
01:48:01 august at the very least but like as an overall arcing project i already explained all of the like
01:48:08 emotional and relevant details that like people will really resonate with in uh the gecko estate
01:48:14 episode four everything is devil man like i explained the whole fucking point of the series in that
01:48:18 video so like i just think that for for the sake of me making money at all and like making videos
01:48:27 that people actually want me to make and that will get any views it how they market is just not a
01:48:33 priority in that situation what's good to know but uh shinsa kai yori i just did a whole fuck wrote a
01:48:40 just recorded a 35 minute video on and sent it to devue so that's the next big project oh yes
01:48:45 oh yeah oh yeah ben go ahead well uh my next project uh well so endless war is a big thing but
01:48:53 at this point in development it's kind of out of my hands and so i have kind of stepped back from
01:48:59 that and that's just going to be ready whenever it's ready uh so i've been working on vapors three
01:49:03 and that's coming along uh i was kind of i had kind of stepped back from that for a while but i'm
01:49:08 ben you need to do something there's something you have to do uh to make endless war good and
01:49:13 monetizable you 100% need to first of all you need to start using the cop killer and the rowdy
01:49:20 fucker like logos in places because like i can't find them anywhere and it it annoys me that they're
01:49:25 not they don't feel real yet they don't feel real we don't really have official logos like the ones
01:49:30 that exist were made by like people in the community like we didn't make well that's all right okay well
01:49:38 what you need to do is you need to iron those out and hammer them down i like the one that you have
01:49:42 is your just top background that's pretty sick yeah but i didn't make whatever i didn't make it
01:49:46 okay but whatever it is make one so that i can buy a t-shirt of it and wear it ben so you can
01:49:52 monetize this shit and make money making shirts fucking munchie had to go on vacation he like
01:49:57 he did yeah he did like he was like hey i'm finally making shirts and i was like okay cool and he
01:50:03 and he was like okay i did some sketches like i did some really rough versions of these shirts
01:50:09 okay now before i finish them by i'm going to italy for two weeks like well that was great
01:50:15 unfortunately yeah so so yeah like obviously we need to start selling merch uh obviously um i just
01:50:22 i want so badly an iRL meetup of people wearing cop killer shirts people wearing rowdy fucker
01:50:28 shirts and street warfare i wanted so bad for iRL meetups right there was a thing in there for a
01:50:33 while there was a map that people could enter their their their locations into you know roughly
01:50:39 we were looking at like where the populations were clustered turned out it was this shitty
01:50:43 this shitty service that like after a hundred page views was like locked and it was like you
01:50:47 had to buy a subscription to look so that was a oh that was a complete bust those garbage and it
01:50:52 really pissed me off but you know if we got clusters of people around certain cities i was
01:50:57 imagining like meetups where that are like okay like we choose a location in like a city and like
01:51:05 it's okay if you're in this meetup sign up and like show a picture of yourself and what you're
01:51:09 going to wear and the the conceit is that killers and rowdies converge on this location and it is
01:51:16 then a race to take a picture of people on the other team and once someone has had their picture
01:51:23 taken and posted on the discord there they've been shot and they're dead and okay it sounds like you're
01:51:30 copying the idea from touch and never falls in love i don't know what the fuck that is it's an
01:51:34 anime well it's a cute idea okay cool uh so yeah it would be like it would be like gang warfare you
01:51:42 show up you like you'd have to be dressed accordingly and the idea is you take a picture of someone
01:51:46 and post it and that means they're dead and then they can't kill anyone and it's just like which
01:51:50 team can kill the other uh i don't know it sounds pretty cool in my head well whatever it is i want
01:51:57 more and everyone wear fucking official shirts and there will be official shirts soon because
01:52:03 it's stupid that there aren't already i want one real real bad all that is to say that i've been
01:52:08 working on vapors three fantastic uh i'm happy to announce uh my new jaguar is literally seconds
01:52:20 from being done in the editing bay and it'll be out this very day of recording so by everybody
01:52:26 hearing it next big project coming is what this is a pretty big project but uh to that point okay
01:52:32 i'll what i'll say is this i have restructured my life to prioritize getting out big projects not
01:52:37 just we aguas in answer to people's concerns okay uh and there you go so you know working on
01:52:42 right eric c bass says how many wait what about mage and tom i don't know if they have any big
01:52:47 projects at the moment do you do you guys talked about my big project we had a whole like half an hour
01:52:52 discussion i don't know about it you're what i would describe as tom's big project would at best
01:52:58 be at easiest be a year and a half away i'd imagine oh god sure but i have other big projects that
01:53:05 are building up to that big project i guess yeah tell us okay all right um i want to make a button
01:53:11 i'm just going to start getting into game dev because i do all this low poly 3d shit the whole
01:53:15 makes sense is that it's just going to make games that look like PlayStation 2 games and have like
01:53:20 the aesthetic of like low poly mascot stuff like ratchet and clank mashed with like uh the edge of
01:53:27 like new grounds as cartoons and stuff like with your your little ninja koon yeah koon i believe
01:53:32 this is his name exactly you got it sick so it's a she but right right i'm gonna make some short
01:53:38 little animation with her doesn't her name some japs shit yeah she's some some tatsumaki hitzubishi
01:53:44 honda tatoyama yeah something like that her name's mitzubishi greatest character of all time uh the
01:53:50 best but no uh just just working on i do like on learning more 3d stuff i was i keep it's interesting
01:53:57 because i keep like i was watching a gaming brit video yesterday because did you like you should
01:54:01 watch the gaming brit and then i marathoned all his videos he's literally my taste in gaming
01:54:05 i'm like that's true that's true this is my guy so uh i was watching something that was a shock
01:54:10 never seen him since he's literally been on the pcp and we're friends i heard of him and i just
01:54:15 never got around to do because i don't watch like review videos anymore like at all sure but then
01:54:20 then i got dragged back into it so i watched all i mean i just been watching gaming brits for longer
01:54:25 than i've known of any of you is the funny thing you know i guess i guess i just missed the bone
01:54:30 i'm sorry gaming brit uh i've made it up i've given you tons of ad revenue the last three days
01:54:35 nice so i was watching one of his videos on ratchet and clank and i noticed like i was looking at
01:54:39 like the ground because like every time i look at playstation 2 games i'm kind of like deconstruct
01:54:43 them now i noticed the ground plane had like repeating tile textures for the grass but then
01:54:47 i had like random patches of dirt like i wonder how they did that so it took like three hours i
01:54:51 figured out how to do it and i put us as a gift of it of it working just like a mask in like other
01:54:56 patches of a different texture on the same material and it was fucking sick and it felt like a god
01:55:01 tom tom one criticism on your work uh sorry ben it's just uh uh mitsubishi the raccoon uh her the
01:55:08 problem with her is that she doesn't have enough gender signifiers might i suggest a big hunk and
01:55:13 pair of titties that's my that's my helpful suggestion okay i gotta get the porn artist
01:55:18 something i wanted to ask so so you did some of the modeling on the uh run away from snakes pump
01:55:25 game right i did pump yes you you okay you just did the character model i did the character of
01:55:32 okay did you do like her animations or i i did not i was i said that i could because i i didn't
01:55:39 even rig rig the character because i was talking hippo about it like like almost two months before
01:55:43 the game came out and i was like do you want me to like rig it up or anything is like just make
01:55:46 the model and like they were going to take care of everything else i'm like okay so it was pretty
01:55:51 simple to do on an unrelated note where i have a shot glass of my urine here and i am going to dip
01:55:58 my keto stick as we speak and i will tell you and i in about 15 seconds i will tell you all the
01:56:04 results when did you produce this i look i went to the bathroom i have my wireless headphones in
01:56:09 god oh my god shot glass i'm glad i'm glad i'm glad to piss in the pcb yeah munchie not here someone
01:56:15 else is carrying on the piss leg you could pronounce the pcb yeah it is i guess so oh no guys
01:56:24 it's not as purple as last time oh god i would i would i would call it a medium pink
01:56:30 oh god well it's over it's all over and i don't understand why if you were on keto you would
01:56:37 ever consume any carbs whatsoever well you don't well i mean i mean i'll eat like peanut butter
01:56:43 which has like a couple grams in it and that's yeah it's tough to avoid yeah like you know veggies
01:56:49 you know you just keep it really uh listen to listen to this question though this is from
01:56:54 spicy salts in the in the discord uh who says i'm trying to make a video game called ultratopia
01:57:00 but i have no talent skill or patience to make it any tips kill yourself stop i think he has the
01:57:07 he has the name and nothing else is what i'm understanding i mean no talent no skill no
01:57:13 patience get fucked dude get fucked well somebody else responded with the the the even better answer
01:57:20 which is find people who have those and pay them a lot of money that makes it well i'm assuming he's
01:57:26 probably doesn't have money either i'm i'm god that's a fair breaking suspicion either get money
01:57:33 or get those other skills he said you don't have that's what i'm working on not not having not
01:57:37 having the patience is what is what tells me that this is a lost cause yeah i got to start
01:57:43 something dude you gotta get your headspace in a better place patience is is crucial to this
01:57:47 you're playing a long game here buddy is a long game so uh eric seabass asks how many days before
01:57:52 you die do you plan to stop making art and start enjoying life uh literally the moment i get rich
01:58:00 i will not oh my god i mean jesus fucking christ you'll you'll get bored though you'll get bored
01:58:05 what okay right it'll take a while for me to get bored if i have everybody if you live to be
01:58:10 fucking 80 and you get bored at 60 that's quite a few years of terrible life i don't need money for
01:58:16 anything all i need to do is live all yeah all i need to do is continue to exist so that i can
01:58:22 continue to produce shit this this this guy's question has it all wrong making the art is enjoying
01:58:27 life this is what i want to do exactly that was what my first thought was like at first i was like
01:58:32 oh i'm gonna give the answer that like all i want to do is make art but then i was like
01:58:36 actually i just want to eat and fuck all day jesus christ and like go to cool places you discuss
01:58:43 i i i understand that i literally don't care about those things and we'll be happy to give them up
01:58:49 forever for more productivity uh because i'm a machine that loves to work and nothing else i like
01:58:56 thank you i mean uh i like eating i like eating's boring eating's boring and you know what
01:59:02 fucking's boring what are you what how can i'm post food i'm post food i'm ordering
01:59:07 humor whatever it's called right now fuel fuel it's human fuel i mean that's a bit short
01:59:11 exactly if i if i these macros look great i think that if i didn't have to actually produce art i would
01:59:20 be content to just imagine art oh god you know like i can just sit around the thrill of the chase
01:59:27 dude the thrill of the chase of of of worrying on the project and pursuing it whatever about
01:59:32 it to me to me getting it done is just like when i've had the idea that's the big come it's like
01:59:38 oh i just had an amazing idea and then it's like one of the come and then it's like oh god damn it
01:59:44 now i have to somehow translate that into something that enough people will understand that i can make
01:59:49 a living off of it i'm not trying to say that like for example like i i mean because for me the
01:59:53 second come is releasing it and like having people react i suppose if i was rich enough i maybe i
01:59:59 still would produce art it would just all be incomprehensible the idea is getting a bonus
02:00:05 making it is the calm oh well i yeah i'm not that's true i'm not trying to say that like i think
02:00:10 there's anything like morally better about like releasing something like i still i you know just
02:00:15 a fucking machine that has inputs and outputs and you know it makes me feel good to get positive
02:00:20 comments and upvotes and whatnot so like i'm not saying it's like better but like that is a that is
02:00:25 a very valuable part of life that i i just think engaging in that will keep me healthy and happy
02:00:30 long term yeah more than not doing that well let me let me rephrase it because i'm at a point in
02:00:35 my life right now where i'm not as interested in being an artist as i am in like what i could
02:00:43 like like something that i could do that would be bigger than art than like i really want to
02:00:47 just build a city so like if i made enough money that i didn't have to do art and i could just
02:00:53 build shit or just like hire people to like shape i just want enough money to shape the world
02:00:58 you know what i mean like like like yeah sure so i feel like with art that's a way to convince
02:01:04 people that they should shape the world but with money you just can do it you could just be like
02:01:10 hey i'm gonna build the like hey this thing that that i made all this art telling people that they
02:01:14 should like do this i'm just gonna well make that happen i mean if that's what you want to do it's
02:01:19 time to stop making youtube videos and start getting into the stock market or something i mean i want
02:01:24 to do it i only want to get rich on my own terms though how is how is playing the stock market
02:01:30 okay rich on your own terms because i don't want to have to learn about stocks then you're
02:01:35 fucking lazy you're the exact same problem that other guy does then i have all these great ideas
02:01:39 but no patience and no talent well except i have talent and skill it's just not in the stock market
02:01:46 it's in making youtube videos okay but if you if you have a goal that that's not going to serve that
02:01:50 you either need to change your goal or change your skills serve that goal tom what if i can find a
02:01:55 way to make youtube videos make me absurdly rich uh i mean you're not gonna get you're not gonna
02:02:00 make cities off of youtube videos i mean i think we don't know that you don't know even even like
02:02:06 cutie pie you just gotta change the paradigm okay i was gonna like you know you okay nobody's
02:02:11 gonna you're taking you're taking people around about options to your goal at this point yeah i agree
02:02:16 let's say that i okay there are definitely like never mind youtube itself think of it as think of
02:02:22 youtube as a jumping off point for just being an artist in general much in the same way that like
02:02:27 celebrities might star in a movie that makes them famous but because they are famous now they just
02:02:32 have an endless sea of opportunity before them so like and they usually you know a lot of them
02:02:38 end up doing these like high-level ventures and shit because they just start reinvesting the money
02:02:42 they already have and you can just pay people to invest your money for you you know like you can
02:02:47 literally when you have money money is a self-propagating machine yes it is just something that you
02:02:52 decide how much you want and then you just you know just operate that paradigm that will that
02:02:58 will make that happen but you need a basic it's a constant redistribution it's constantly like
02:03:04 assessing the money you have figuring out what you can do with that money to get more money and then
02:03:09 continually putting that in but like to do that in the early days is just boring and gay and it's
02:03:15 all like i gotta buy stocks and like i want to be past that point before i even worry about it
02:03:20 like i want to make as much as i can through just being an artist and then once i'm like semi like
02:03:27 new rich from being an artist that's when it's like i hire an account and and then i just like
02:03:31 tell them hey put my money in whatever stocks seem good you know and like so yeah that's that's
02:03:37 my methodology here that's sort of my my theory behind all this good luck you maybe you should
02:03:43 have got a cheaper house well i'm saying it would i mean that's like a real short-term problem you
02:03:51 know relatively speaking i mean if your goal is to achieve a critical mass of money then you
02:03:57 gotta scrimp well scrimp right whatever right am i crazy here no i don't know where you're going
02:04:03 up with that theory i i mean the less money you spend the more you have but like we're talking
02:04:08 about degrees here well the point of it is that you should always be astronomically increasing
02:04:12 your intake of wealth like it should never be a matter of like i have to save money it should
02:04:18 always just be like if i need more money i just need to make more money you know okay you know
02:04:24 yeah okay you don't want to get lost up in that i mean you can lose yourself in the pursuit of
02:04:28 money but uh oh yeah but that's the that's why i don't want to go into the stock market that to
02:04:32 me is losing fair enough you know yeah okay doing it doing it on your own terms as long as it's
02:04:37 always just whatever you're comfortable with it's like you know i like like i said earlier it's
02:04:42 possible to be in the youtube analysis game or whatever and then also lose yourself that is
02:04:47 monetization or whatnot i do not care about money i've seen it happen at all i do not care about
02:04:53 changing the world at all i care about operating within this world and succeeding in it with my own
02:04:59 effort and my own my own two hands and i am glad to be an artist because that is a profession
02:05:07 that i feel i can continue to do in a way that is you know you know fun and engaging and in a
02:05:14 way that i can do it on my own terms right up until i dropped it yeah and that's what i want
02:05:20 uh i just basically agree i just want to you know i i feel like it'll never it'll i'll never be
02:05:26 i don't ever have to become completely obsolete i hope yeah i pray i i consider it my personal
02:05:33 mission to to when i die to be able to look back and say i brought us one step closer to escaping
02:05:40 entropy that's the best case scenario i'd say uh speaking of which i think all of us i think all
02:05:46 of us have already made contributions to that end so you know i generally are all absorbed in my book
02:05:51 well all right but speaking of entropy uh please look at this image that i put in the thing because
02:05:57 i'm having massive second thoughts about getting this huel because of the sheer propensity of
02:06:01 soy boys that are that are operating with this huel thing look at this guy on the on the second
02:06:06 from the top right that's all i see in this picture it ironically it is the non-soil alternative
02:06:14 and yet we're faced with a with a with a tire a wall of soy boys i don't know look look mate we
02:06:19 gotta take it back clearly these people we do it you know what you're right you're right all right
02:06:23 i'm still on board i'm still on board we'll do this together you you're more than me you'll be the
02:06:28 poster child i'll be the one in the background adding numbers holy shit right two hours ten
02:06:32 all right everybody uh the patreon uh yeah p-lash some say oh someone asked pro crass maybe no

02:06:47 oh yeah that was from uh i don't know what do you guys want that's they tell us that's a great
02:06:52 question that's a great question actually yeah tell us what you would like to pay more money for
02:06:57 and don't say more content as long as the answer is not more content give us an answer what if
02:07:02 we uh like to be able to hear these live when they're recording them you know here's a really
02:07:06 fucking simple solution i don't know what what if we like had a tech scroll of patrons during the
02:07:12 an outro song i mean if that's what they want i just want to know like what do you guys like
02:07:19 from what do you like to pay a lot of money for that is not more content or even what would you
02:07:26 pay a little money for if you're not paying a little money already if you're a patron put in
02:07:31 the suggestions bar in the discord you know and if you're not a patron tell us what we would you
