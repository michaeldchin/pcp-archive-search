00:00:00 Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:05 I'm the best guy ever. What do we got going on here? We got Hippos here.
00:00:09 Hello, everybody.
00:00:11 We got Lethal Aurora Maid.
00:00:14 Oh, shoot. I'm second. Hi. Hello. I am here.
00:00:17 Indeed. I'm alive. We've got Ben Saint.
00:00:24 Tom Oliver.
00:00:25 Hey. Oh, let's go.
00:00:28 Oh, hey. And of course, Endless Jess.
00:00:32 Oh, fuck. Hello. It's also me.
00:00:36 Oh, man. Well.
00:00:37 What a cast of characters. What a motley crew.
00:00:40 This is a motley crew.
00:00:41 So, I posted a question, and I can't pronounce it because pronunciation is part of the question.
00:00:47 So, I want you guys to bidet it.
00:00:49 It's pronounced bidet.
00:00:50 It's pronounced by debt.
00:00:52 Anyone ever use a bidet?
00:00:53 I hope to one day. It's a dream of mine to own one.
00:00:56 Actually. Okay. Funny story about a bidet.
00:00:59 So, the house I live in, there used to be a guy who lived here,
00:01:04 who we called Little John, and Little John had bidets,
00:01:08 and he installed bidets on every toilet in the house.
00:01:10 Bidets for days.
00:01:12 Yeah. And so, we do have bidets, right?
00:01:15 Like, they are on every toilet.
00:01:16 But I tried it one time, and I hated it.
00:01:19 I thought it was, like, horrible.
00:01:21 It was like a powerful, concentrated stream of water that shot right at your anus,
00:01:28 and I don't like it. I do not like it.
00:01:32 I wonder about the cleanup. Do you have, like, a towel?
00:01:35 Like, how do you, I guess, toilet paper?
00:01:36 I assume you would just use toilet paper.
00:01:39 I mean, I never got good with it, right?
00:01:40 I never mastered the techniques.
00:01:43 Yeah.
00:01:44 So, we have them, and I don't like them.
00:01:47 Maybe I should give it another shot.
00:01:49 Another shot.
00:01:50 Suddenly, bidets.
00:01:52 They're in the general sphere of anything involving my asshole is gay.
00:01:57 Yeah. I was going to say, that's pretty homo-adjacent, if you ask me.
00:02:01 It's not, though.
00:02:02 It's not that it's gay.
00:02:03 It's just that it was like, oh, god, wow, what, no.
00:02:06 It feels bad.
00:02:07 This raises the old question of, is a man getting pegged by his wife, let's say, is that gay?
00:02:14 I mean, there's no man in the way.
00:02:16 It's not gay. It's just sad.
00:02:18 I actually wanted to mention this the last time this sort of thing came up,
00:02:22 because the whole, is it gay?
00:02:24 I know it's a meme, partially, but people do ask these questions.
00:02:29 And it's always stupid, because gay is a sexual preference.
00:02:33 It is not a physical action.
00:02:35 Like, any physical action can be anything, but your perception of it is your preference for the same sex.
00:02:45 That's what it means.
00:02:46 Touching a foot can be just as non-sexual as it can be sexual.
00:02:49 So, yeah, I can see what you're talking about.
00:02:51 Let me make an argument for why I kind of think it is gay, even though there's no man involved.
00:02:57 But the pegging is approximating or simulating an act that naturally could only be performed by another man.
00:03:08 Surely, we're not comparing the act of literally getting fucked in the butt
00:03:13 to just splashing water on it to keep it clean from poopies.
00:03:17 No, I don't think a bidet is gay.
00:03:20 I mean, it could be.
00:03:21 But I think getting pegged by your wife is kind of gay.
00:03:24 If the pegging thing isn't gay, we can surely say that the bidet is not gay.
00:03:28 So, you know, I'm using that as a starting point.
00:03:30 I think the getting pegged kind of is gay.
00:03:32 I think it's kind of gay.
00:03:33 I think getting pegged by your husband is definitely gay.
00:03:37 Well, of course.
00:03:38 Unless you're a woman, well, I guess that's not a good point.
00:03:42 I didn't think of it that way.
00:03:43 I think it's not gay unless you think it's a guy, unless you think it's the same sex.
00:03:47 I don't think so.
00:03:48 If you just concentrate really hard on it being something else, then it's not gay.
00:03:55 I think even if you're not into guys, I still think it's kind of gay to get pegged.
00:04:00 That's the thing, though.
00:04:02 Not if there's anything wrong with that.
00:04:04 Ah, Jerry, she had man hands.
00:04:06 This leads to another question.
00:04:07 Does that mean, like, food is gay?
00:04:09 It's also approximating dude parts?
00:04:14 I mean, I just said, like, gay is a sexual preference.
00:04:17 Preference for the same gender as you.
00:04:19 I'm glad that right off the bat, we're getting down to the real issues that matter in the world.
00:04:22 Man, these issues are too complex.
00:04:24 Why don't we all just, everyone in the world just say,
00:04:26 fuck it, we're all gay, and then we don't have to think about this anymore?
00:04:29 We're everyone's gay.
00:04:30 Hey, I think that's the big brain thing to do now in 2019.
00:04:35 We've concluded this.
00:04:36 Everyone's on the gay spectrum a little bit.
00:04:39 I don't think food is necessary.
00:04:41 It probably mostly is gay, but I don't think it's always gay.
00:04:44 Okay, so surely you'd say that, like, the whole man getting pegged by his wife.
00:04:47 Again, that's, like, partially gay.
00:04:48 Obviously not, like, full gay.
00:04:50 Well, we're all about a wife getting pegged by her wife.
00:04:53 Yeah, obviously.
00:04:54 It's not as gay as it's less gay than getting pegged by a guy, obviously.
00:04:58 But what about a wife getting pegged by her other wife?
00:05:02 I mean, that's still gay, but woman gay, which isn't real gay.
00:05:06 I think that would be straight.
00:05:07 That would be straight because, like, the phallus thing is like...
00:05:11 Oh, okay, well, then it's straighter.
00:05:13 It's straighter than not pegging each other, but it's less straight than getting pegged by a husband.
00:05:20 Can a woman be pegged?
00:05:21 We've got to draw up a graph here.
00:05:23 We've got to just, like, put all these in, like, quadrants.
00:05:26 Since we're talking about gay things...
00:05:27 When a woman gets pegged, isn't she just getting fucked in the ass?
00:05:30 Isn't that not pegging anymore?
00:05:31 Is there a distinction?
00:05:32 Is there a distinction there?
00:05:34 It's still gay if a woman's getting pegged.
00:05:40 Is there a distinction in the nomenclature?
00:05:41 The only pegs I care about are clothes pegs, to do the laundry and to put the clothes pegs.
00:05:48 Since we're talking about gay things, I want to mention a thing.
00:05:52 Double-decker, Doug and Carole, this anime, that's kind of a little bit gay, but not really.
00:05:57 Do you want to tell them our secret mage?
00:05:59 Yes, I want to share the secret.
00:06:03 I'm going to reveal the secret.
00:06:05 I showed Ben this anime, and although we haven't finished watching it,
00:06:09 he liked it, and I'm so happy.
00:06:11 We got, like, six episodes in.
00:06:13 Oh, no, Ben watched the anime.
00:06:14 And it was... I didn't...
00:06:16 Yeah, I actually was enjoying it.
00:06:17 It was actually pretty good.
00:06:19 Belie, I know, right?
00:06:20 I know, sad.
00:06:22 It was fun, though.
00:06:23 It is, it was.
00:06:25 Like, that's why...
00:06:25 What is the anime?
00:06:27 Give me the picture.
00:06:28 It's called Double-decker.
00:06:29 Double-decker, Doug and Carole.
00:06:31 Yeah, it's about cops in New York?
00:06:35 Question mark, question mark, question mark.
00:06:37 San Francisco?
00:06:38 I don't know, they're in some...
00:06:39 Oh, Maple?
00:06:40 I think it's like an American...
00:06:41 It's like a Japanese sort of...
00:06:45 It's sort of like...
00:06:47 If you took the character designs from Persona, and instead of a school murder mystery,
00:06:53 you put them in an American style...
00:06:55 Or the Japanese approximation of an American-style buddy cop sort of action drama.
00:07:00 And then you gave someone a big anime gun with a cool, like, 3D...
00:07:04 Like, oh, I'm charging up my gun, and I'm shooting my gun at the end of the episode.
00:07:07 Like, that kind of thing.
00:07:08 Now, is Digimon transformation happening?
00:07:10 Is gun a euphemism, or is it an actual gun?
00:07:12 No, it's...
00:07:13 He has a...
00:07:14 We were just talking about gay shit, so excuse my confusion.
00:07:17 He has a secret science gun that counteracts the effects of a drug
00:07:21 that turns people into monsters, not unlike Joy and Lisa.
00:07:26 He has a secret gun that counterfeits people turning gay.
00:07:29 So it's a magic gun.
00:07:32 Where did he purchase that?
00:07:36 I think he got it from the police department, so there you go.
00:07:39 Well, all right, so I guess it's a secret to the other people, but not to the police.
00:07:43 Just made to have answers.
00:07:44 It's similar to the police department.
00:07:46 It's called like...
00:07:48 Right, right, it's like a secret branch.
00:07:50 Yeah, it's like a sister branch of the police.
00:07:52 Okay.
00:07:53 That deals specifically with dealings with that drug, because that drug,
00:07:58 turns people into literal monsters.
00:08:01 So...
00:08:01 Yeah, dude.
00:08:02 It changes the human genome.
00:08:05 Sick, I love blood.
00:08:06 That's the way to do it, if ever there was one.
00:08:09 Hey, I've got a fear, a deep-seated fear and insecurity I want to discuss
00:08:14 based on the Miamath of an episode I just released of Green Screen Memes.
00:08:21 And basically...
00:08:21 Saw that on Twitter.
00:08:23 Yes, yep, it's out.
00:08:24 It's good.
00:08:25 Here's the thing, though.
00:08:27 When you are...
00:08:28 I consider myself a pretty funny guy.
00:08:30 I think I've got some japs and some jokes.
00:08:32 Oh, I'm laughing.
00:08:33 Yeah, indeed.
00:08:35 It is so...
00:08:36 Okay, with this video, more than others, but I feel this a lot.
00:08:40 It is truly terrifying to me.
00:08:42 The idea of releasing something that I'm trying to make funny,
00:08:46 but to have it not be received as funny.
00:08:49 This haunts me a lot of the time.
00:08:51 So where's that gonna happen?
00:08:52 Wait, what happened?
00:08:53 I stepped away for a bit.
00:08:55 What happened?
00:08:57 I'm sure you can relate to this, Jesse.
00:08:58 It's my deep-seated fear of trying to be funny and failing.
00:09:01 And it is just...
00:09:02 Oh, God, if that ever happens, I'll die.
00:09:04 I'll kill myself.
00:09:06 Thank God it hasn't happened yet, to my knowledge, indeed.
00:09:09 Everyone says this, right?
00:09:10 But, you know, they can't all be gems.
00:09:13 No one's gonna succeed 100% of the time.
00:09:15 So even if you're funny, even some of the time,
00:09:19 I think people will generally forgive you if sometimes you fail.
00:09:23 You know what I mean?
00:09:24 That's definitely, I think that's one of the most everything in life.
00:09:27 I think that depends on the age of your audience.
00:09:30 Young people expect to be laughing constantly, or else they'll kill themselves.
00:09:34 Well, you know, I mean, it's fair to consider your audience, I guess.
00:09:38 I've always heard, like, you listen to comedians talk about being a comedian,
00:09:42 and they always say, like, everybody bombs sometimes.
00:09:45 Once in a while, even the grits go out there and bomb.
00:09:47 But like, so here's the thing.
00:09:48 I've done stand-up two times, and neither time I bombed.
00:09:52 So like, if I never do it again, I'll be the only comedian I've ever bombed.
00:09:59 Yeah, yeah, perfect batting average.
00:10:01 Just leave now, you've done it.
00:10:02 I just retire, I'm done.
00:10:04 I'm the greatest comedian who's ever lived.
00:10:06 This is the issue, though.
00:10:08 I mean, okay, so like, when I'm normally making like a video or whatever,
00:10:11 so like, this is in the context of like, the green screen meme video I just released.
00:10:14 So like, haha, like, Filthy Frank did it.
00:10:17 You know, other people have done it.
00:10:18 I'm like, this would be funny.
00:10:19 Jeremy did it.
00:10:20 Jeremy did it, indeed.
00:10:21 So these people are like, you know, really funny.
00:10:25 And I'm like, I did this, I did some goofs and gaffes,
00:10:29 and I'm looking back at it, and I'm like, this is not as funny.
00:10:32 This is like, kind of funny, but like, but the thing is, I have to release a video,
00:10:37 because it's me and Mavva.
00:10:38 I have no choice.
00:10:39 And I don't want people to like, I'm not of a negative perception of the video.
00:10:42 It's like, I go into it and releases, and then someone says like, Nate,
00:10:46 you're no, you're no Filthy Frank.
00:10:48 And I'm like, um, okay, fair, fair, but I bet, I bet that in general,
00:10:54 this video will go around and some people will have some positive experiences of it.
00:10:59 And any potential, like, like, it's not as good as the best who've ever done it,
00:11:04 will be overshadowed by what good it does do in the larger, you know,
00:11:08 in the larger ecosphere of video creation.
00:11:11 And so I'm, I'm hinging my will on that.
00:11:14 And like, in general, when it comes to work being produced,
00:11:17 and this is kind of the spirit of me and Mavva, and I don't know,
00:11:20 and we ag want everything I do to force me to get stuff out.
00:11:24 So I don't obsess about it.
00:11:26 It's not worth just sitting around and being concerned about
00:11:29 and worrying that like you're going to bomb,
00:11:31 even if like this video turns out to be hated and despised or whatever.
00:11:34 Like it's just one video of many put out during me and Mavva.
00:11:38 I did that fucking Sopranos ASMR video who asked me a Mavva.
00:11:42 If there was every forgotten video in the best guy ever catalog, it was that video.
00:11:48 I certainly don't remember it.
00:11:49 Indeed, no one does.
00:11:51 And I can't blame it.
00:11:51 See, Nate, you have the perfect cover here because if this video does bomb,
00:11:55 you can just be like, well, I only did it in 24 hours.
00:11:57 You know?
00:11:58 I mean, that's true.
00:11:58 That's true.
00:11:59 You have the perfect cover.
00:12:00 But like, that defense, that defense is like, if someone,
00:12:03 like if you're arguing with someone as to like why you're not shit,
00:12:06 then like that's fine.
00:12:07 But that's a whole different thing from like
00:12:10 getting people to think you're funny in general,
00:12:13 because you can't debate them one-on-one and explain your situation.
00:12:16 You've just got to be funny and give them a positive pressure.
00:12:18 Humor like anything else is subjective.
00:12:20 So if some people don't find it funny, you're just like, well, that wasn't to your taste.
00:12:23 Like, okay.
00:12:24 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:12:25 You got your bases covered here.
00:12:27 This was a prime time to experiment.
00:12:28 Look that another way.
00:12:29 You will always fail because someone will always not find it funny.
00:12:34 I mean, of course, of course, that's true.
00:12:36 And I don't know.
00:12:36 I'm not trying to say that I'm like overly concerned about it,
00:12:39 but it did get me thinking because like I do think about, you know,
00:12:42 I mean, I was thinking certainly about like the filthy Frank clock and like
00:12:46 but to think about it from another way, like that filthy Frank clock thing,
00:12:50 like sure, it's funny, but it was just some retarded shit.
00:12:52 He probably just had a broken clock around and he didn't like have some grand plan
00:12:57 to make it be like, you know, this thing that gets used all the time.
00:13:00 He was already a very successful guy, obviously.
00:13:03 So people would like it no matter what.
00:13:04 And here's another thing.
00:13:05 I don't know.
00:13:05 Here's another thing to consider, like all those green screen memes,
00:13:08 like their hilarity is reinforced by the context that you know them in.
00:13:13 So like, I think I think if we just saw the filthy Frank clock
00:13:16 of devoid of context now, we'd be like, huh, okay,
00:13:19 it's all the memes that it's used for that make it great.
00:13:22 That is absolutely true.
00:13:23 You know, it's all kind of just like the fact that it's filthy Frank doing it.
00:13:27 True. Very true.
00:13:29 I mean, what can you do about that?
00:13:30 You know, the filthy Frank is like famous man.
00:13:32 He's like the mainstream green screen guy that is everywhere that like broke into the
00:13:37 into the world.
00:13:37 But you know, who's the true connoisseur of the green screen,
00:13:41 the true champion of the green screen meme is Jerma.
00:13:44 Jerma put out a green screen video that was like he did it for like five hours.
00:13:49 And then like, yeah, it's a huge stream.
00:13:51 And he did like every possible like action and thing like reaction possible.
00:13:57 When I finished it, I felt so deeply and he made it for the purposes of like
00:14:03 having his followers make films with it.
00:14:06 Right. Right.
00:14:06 And it was so robust and great.
00:14:10 I one of the main things I felt as I was like editing and finishing was like,
00:14:13 oh, there's so many reactions like different types.
00:14:17 I wish I'd put really I skewed mostly towards the like negative reaction of various stripes
00:14:23 towards the thing on screen that I am referring to.
00:14:26 Like that's the vast majority of it.
00:14:28 And like that's fine.
00:14:29 But I wanted there to be more like positive ones that could be used in funny ways.
00:14:33 I don't know.
00:14:34 Yeah, I'd be like so scared that like I jump in front of the green screen and go,
00:14:38 this guy is a stupid piece of shit.
00:14:40 And then someone just put me behind me.
00:14:42 And it's like, oh, no, why would you do that?
00:14:47 I mean, I'm thinking about it now.
00:14:49 I mean, just I guess I was taken to the extreme.
00:14:51 Like you could take any of these kinds of things.
00:14:53 And like, I don't know, you could put it to like some horrible like terrorist footage
00:14:57 and have just be in me like, like, haha.
00:14:59 Epic joke, my dude.
00:15:01 I just had the perfect idea.
00:15:02 I mean, this is the thing I came up with like years ago when I was doing like the green screen
00:15:07 like stupid shit where I would you get this video from you, Nate, you take the same video
00:15:13 and you put in the background and you offset it by about 10 seconds.
00:15:16 Oh, yeah.
00:15:16 And so you're just reacting to the last thing you did.
00:15:22 Oh, that's good.
00:15:24 I will come out of that one looking rosy.
00:15:25 Let me tell you because I'm roasting guys in this in this clip show.
00:15:30 Well, that's it.
00:15:30 These are my thoughts on comedy and green screen memes.
00:15:34 Ladies and gentlemen, please enjoy.
00:15:36 I did.
00:15:38 Savory.
00:15:38 Well, speaking of Mia Maffova and speaking of having thoughts on things,
00:15:42 what about that final fantasy seven trailer that came there?
00:15:46 There's a topic.
00:15:46 Oh, my goodness.
00:15:48 Oh, I haven't seen that yet.
00:15:50 I haven't.
00:15:51 Well, I mean, I haven't watched Nate's video yet because I was like, maybe I'll do a video.
00:15:56 So I didn't want to watch Nate's first and pepper it.
00:15:58 But since we're on the fucking podcast, what did you think?
00:16:02 Well, okay.
00:16:03 So first of all, there was the initial sinking in my stomach when I first saw it that,
00:16:07 oh no, it's still happening.
00:16:09 It hasn't been canceled.
00:16:11 Of course, though, that was the initial motion.
00:16:13 I had almost forgotten.
00:16:15 Beyond that, I mean, there were some things looked cool.
00:16:20 Like my second reaction beyond that was like, oh, it's cool to see final fantasy seven
00:16:23 like looking nice, which it does.
00:16:25 I actually thought it was pretty reassuring for the most part.
00:16:28 Right up until the end, where fucking Sephiroth shows up for no fucking reason in the reactor.
00:16:34 I made a big screed.
00:16:35 I said a big thing about like, no, no, no, no, you don't understand.
00:16:37 Sephiroth does not show up on final fantasy seven until so far later to like build him up
00:16:43 as an antagonist of like mystery and suspense and shit.
00:16:46 Like I get that like, because it's 20 years later, you can't really have Sephiroth be a
00:16:50 surprise anymore.
00:16:51 Yeah, yeah, but you can though, just like, because the eyes will be hungry.
00:16:57 Like it's like narratively and like interesting.
00:17:03 It would just feel better to like, even if you know, if you've seen a movie before
00:17:07 and you know what the monster that he comes out like, I don't know, like the thing or something,
00:17:11 you know what the thing is.
00:17:14 But watching the movie from the beginning, the suspense is still built because it's just
00:17:18 good film.
00:17:19 It's just good film.
00:17:20 Maybe, I mean, perhaps this is a more cynical calculation by Square Enix that like,
00:17:24 they just want to start putting Sephiroth in promotional art.
00:17:28 I mean, in every way, I think this is a mistake.
00:17:31 If they're doing it, I can't stop them, whatever.
00:17:33 They're doing this like episodic release as far as we know.
00:17:35 I think that was confirmed recently too.
00:17:37 The only way that it could be acceptable to me is if they're just doing like a thing
00:17:41 where they're expanding on clouds like mental episodes and he's hallucinating Sephiroth.
00:17:46 I mean, that's definitely what they're, okay, this is the thing.
00:17:49 Cause like FF7, to this day, I'm pretty confused as to exactly what the implications are of what's
00:17:56 going on inside clouds head when we get the like black screen, white text at various times.
00:18:01 And like we know Sephiroth is involved with like Genova connection and stuff going on.
00:18:06 But like, frankly, this is, this is kind of my other point I made in my video.
00:18:09 Like I love the ambiguity and I like not knowing what the fuck's going on because it makes the
00:18:15 game feel better.
00:18:16 And do I think that a bunch of like, I don't know, I don't think there's anyone in the world
00:18:22 who like really is served by trying to fill in every possible detail in a story.
00:18:27 I think that in general, you're better off leaving a bunch of stuff to the audience's imagination.
00:18:32 I think there's a difference between something being to this day confusing and something being
00:18:37 open to interpretation, like it could be this.
00:18:41 Well, like I said, I know what's going on.
00:18:43 Sephiroth is communicating with cloud like through Genova connection.
00:18:46 But like it's presented in such a mysterious way that like you won't know that.
00:18:51 But now you will in the remake because Sephiroth's right there.
00:18:55 I mean, like there are people who don't actually actually, there's probably a ton of people who
00:19:00 if they played following 57 for the first time right now, they'd remember the bombing mission.
00:19:04 But they'd forget that during the bombing mission at the very beginning of the game,
00:19:08 cloud has one of his psychotic breaks because we all kind of forget that like a lot of FF7
00:19:14 is just dealing with how mentally fucked up cloud really is.
00:19:17 We just think about, oh, the buster sword. Oh, we fight Sephiroth.
00:19:21 You forget about like the horror element and the body horror element of cloud,
00:19:25 literally losing control of himself and it's fucked up and it's scary and spooky.
00:19:30 And like, I mean, I really hope they preserve that element.
00:19:33 But I just think they'll lack kind of the delicate touch that's required.
00:19:38 I'm also really worried that they're gonna do like the fanwanky like arch nemesis thing with
00:19:43 Sephiroth that they've been doing. Of course they are. Of course they are.
00:19:46 Even in the trailer, he shows up at the fucking bombing mission and immediately refers to cloud
00:19:51 by name. And it's like, oh my God. It don't say that. Don't call him cloud. You don't care about him.
00:19:57 Cloud, it literally isn't important right now. He literally means nothing to Sephiroth.
00:20:01 Like in the game, like yeah, like cloud is kind of obsessed with him because he's scared of him.
00:20:05 I guess he did kill Sephiroth. I guess he is the one who stabbed Sephiroth before.
00:20:08 Yeah, but like to Sephiroth, cloud is just-
00:20:11 This isn't the 10th since I have no context for anything.
00:20:13 Well, like in the original game-
00:20:14 We'll be done. We'll write.
00:20:15 As far as Sephiroth-
00:20:15 No, it's okay. I legit mean it. This is funny to just listen to it.
00:20:20 Yeah. Well, like the whole thing was that like cloud thought of Sephiroth as like the worst thing
00:20:25 that ever happened to him. But to Sephiroth, cloud is just some dork in a blue suit who fucking
00:20:30 threw him over a cliff once by accident. Like I don't think he ever, in the original
00:20:35 game, is not until like halfway through at least, there's not a point where Sephiroth
00:20:38 goes, hey cloud, it's me. Fuck you. He's always like, who the fuck are you again? Oh yeah,
00:20:42 that little meat puppet that I fucking don't care about.
00:20:45 I think the moment when cloud starts to actually matter is when cloud turns out to be the most
00:20:50 successful of all the men cloaked in black, who's the one who actually delivered the black
00:20:55 materia to Sephiroth and Northern Crater. That's what made cloud like special in this situation,
00:20:59 basically. He was the successful one.
00:21:01 So what a good game. What a cool like, what a unique story that's never like been
00:21:06 done again. And you know what bothers me? I hate the fact that when this game inevitably
00:21:11 fucking craps itself out upon the world. Everything that is good about it, Square Enix is gonna get
00:21:16 all the credit as if they just now made all this good stuff. But everything that's good about it
00:21:20 will be the stuff that was good 20 years ago. And they don't deserve the credit. This game is
00:21:26 gonna get, this game is gonna get perfect scores that it didn't earn. It's gonna be standing on
00:21:30 the shoulders of what came before it. And that's my, I guess I'm, I don't really care. That's my
00:21:36 pretend. You know, my, the only other thing I want to say about it is that like with the episodic
00:21:41 release, I mean, God, I could see this game not doing as well as they think it's going to. I mean,
00:21:47 I don't know, it is like one of the biggest games of all time. It's getting this like beautiful
00:21:52 remaster. No, like people don't care that it doesn't play the way it used to, or that it's going to
00:21:57 be less subtle. Nobody gives a shit. They just want to play as Cloud again. So I was gonna say that
00:22:02 like, maybe with the weird episodic release, people will like get frustrated and if they make
00:22:07 weird design choices, but frankly, like considering how well like crisis course hold and like all
00:22:13 the spinoffs, like, I don't know, Advent Children, everybody loves it, it's probably inevitably
00:22:17 just gonna do amazingly well. So I'd let Square Enix really fuck something up. Can you imagine,
00:22:22 though, if they get like a game or two in and then like, wow, this is like not doing as well,
00:22:26 we have to drop this like this is we're investing too much in this and then they don't finish it.
00:22:31 Like, I'm just saying that would be a true nightmare for everybody forever. And then when
00:22:38 when this happens on that day, they'll come crawling back to me and they'll say, Nate,
00:22:42 you were so right. Oh, you we shouldn't have done it. We shouldn't have strayed from God's light,
00:22:47 but we did now take us back and I will whisper no, no, you die. You die in the muck with them.
00:22:55 As a me as a gamer who whose DNA is not like thoroughly interwoven with Final Fantasy seven,
00:23:01 like I played it a few years ago, not as a child and I like it and I kind of want to replay it.
00:23:06 But I'm not like me too. I'm not like it's on the switch. This whole like thing with the remake,
00:23:13 probably I would not completely ignore it. And that's fine. I don't really feel the need to get
00:23:18 another one. But I think we can all agree that the most interesting part of Final Fantasy seven
00:23:24 remake is what they will do with Tifa. Oh, boy, on the edge of our seats waiting to see if they're
00:23:30 going to have like maybe a virtue signaling, you know, like we made her like, what are they going
00:23:37 to do? It's just like that's going to give her no tits and like big muscles and make her look
00:23:42 masculine and be like, you know, let's just make her black. They're going to cover up her entire
00:23:46 body. They're going to put her in like a big coat, a big poofy like George Costanza, you racist,
00:23:50 bro. What are you racist, bro? It's time to make Tifa black. This was inevitable. I mean,
00:23:55 when you think about it, right, when you think about it, like the progress, like the progressive
00:24:00 thing to do, like all like all the things she does, all those stereotypically black things she
00:24:04 does, like obviously she was black all along. Like a data white man, for example. Yeah, exactly.
00:24:10 We got to change all the characters to be black and we got to change Barrett to be like Albino.
00:24:14 He's got to be the only white one, but he's got to talk exactly. Have you guys,
00:24:17 have you guys seen, there is an image, you know what, I'll find this for the show notes. There's
00:24:20 an image of like, actually, this actually looks really cool. It's the main cast, like they're
00:24:25 all black and like cloud has like cool, like I don't know what they're called, but like cool little
00:24:30 like sunglasses, spiky black hair guy, hair things, like Lil Yachty kind of, not Lil Yachty,
00:24:34 but whatever. Tifa's got like a big like poofy curly hair. She's a black lady, but then Barrett,
00:24:39 like is just a white dude, or he might even be Japanese with like this weird like shaved sides
00:24:43 of his head sort of thing going on. I don't know, I'm gonna find it because it's pretty cool.
00:24:48 But yeah, like that, the whole Tifa thing, they've made a point to not show Tifa at all.
00:24:55 And it's just, it's getting me on the edge of my seat. This is the suspense that they will not
00:25:00 have in the actual game is the meta. They've changed it all around. Tifa is Sephiroth now,
00:25:07 and Sephiroth is going to be with you in the party. That's the real hoodwink they're pulling
00:25:10 right now. They better give Sephiroth big boobies. What if you're, what if you're wrong? What if it,
00:25:14 what if they're gonna give Tifa big old titties and it's, and it's fine? Is that, will that be fine?
00:25:19 They're investing in millions. Will you be satisfied, you animals?
00:25:22 Millions of dollars right now, they're investing into our tip physics to make them be
00:25:26 fucking perfect. That's why they can't show her yet. They're not finished. My main issue
00:25:31 is simply that like, look, look, I played a game that you guys made a million years ago.
00:25:35 You're now, you're like, you're like, I get it, things have to change. All I'm saying is,
00:25:39 you can't expect me to not notice when things are different. Like, I will try to judge fairly and
00:25:44 decide if it's like a positive change, a negative change, a neutral change. But when things change,
00:25:49 my brain will notice. And like, what, am I supposed to apologize for that? I don't give a
00:25:53 shit. It's their problem, not mine. So, so yeah, that's, maybe, maybe like, if it was a company
00:26:00 had more goodwill towards, I suppose the nice thing to do would be like, you know, give them
00:26:05 some leeway, Nate, they, they're like, like, for example, cloud, cloud in the latest trailer
00:26:10 looked significantly more Japanese than he did in the first trailer to me. His eyes looked like
00:26:15 more. Yeah, I had the same thought. Like, it's, and frankly, call me a call me a KKK white nationalist
00:26:23 member of the Klan. But like, quote that, quote that, quote that, quote that, put that on the green
00:26:29 screen. It's just that like, okay, that that's taking some getting used to, because like, sure,
00:26:34 cloud's been in like Advent Children, he looks more Japanese, but like in the original game,
00:26:38 he's just like a Lego guy with like blond hair blue eyes, I don't know. In the original game,
00:26:42 he's from, he's from Nebelheim, which is clearly a European village.
00:26:50 That's true. And like, and there's already an Asian character in the game, Yuffie,
00:26:54 who comes from an actual Asian place. True, that is very true. Yeah.
00:26:59 Um, well, I don't know. I think you're probably right canonically about that. But probably the
00:27:06 audience, right, like the Japanese audience, because he was just a Lego man, probably looked at him
00:27:11 and saw someone like that. Oh, no, no, no, we saw someone like us. I'm sure that's true. And I don't,
00:27:16 I don't blame them at all. I'm just saying as a natural consequence of like having to make this
00:27:20 design more realistic, like now this thing, like I was saying before, like before, there was less
00:27:25 information as to like the specifics of exactly his facial structure and ethnicity, and we could
00:27:29 all project like whatever we wanted now as an as an inevitable consequence of upgrading it to HD.
00:27:35 They like, they basically have to choose a race. And I'm just saying like someone is going to be
00:27:40 like, that's not how I imagined it, no matter what. But I mean, it's just inevitable. I mean,
00:27:44 they didn't choose black, so they fucked up. I mean, when you have a game that was already
00:27:49 multicultural and clearly had people from different regions looking, there were different races from
00:27:55 specific different places already. And cloud clearly was from a tiny little European, like
00:28:00 German fucking, like leader hose in town. I mean, he's blonde. Yeah. And that goes a long way.
00:28:06 He's blonde. Yeah, blonde from the cradle. So do you think the cloud dies his hair? Do you think
00:28:12 he's the kind of guy to dye his hair? And he would have to have at like the age of like nine,
00:28:17 so probably not. Yeah. So I'm, oh, I don't know, gonna go out on a limb here. Yeah, I think Jesse's
00:28:23 probably right with the Nibbleheim connection. We got, we got to answer the NQ. Yay, I'm right.
00:28:31 Something's gonna be bad. Woo. I just want to say, though, that there was, there was a little bit
00:28:36 of controversy I saw online. This isn't a big deal or anything, but like some people were saying that
00:28:41 like Barrett sounds too stereotypical in the new trailer. They didn't like his kind of, have they
00:28:46 seen Barrett? In the original game, doesn't he literally say he pities the fool?
00:28:54 Okay. In the, he is, his design is 100% a Mr. T based design. This, I think this is confirmed
00:29:00 by the designers. So we all know this. So he's definitely just like a big black guy. Now,
00:29:04 I was actually doing a little research. There's some videos on YouTube and whatnot that are like
00:29:09 breaking down. This is actually specifically about like, if Barrett's like translation to English
00:29:14 was like an accurate representation of like the way he was. And it does seem like they played it
00:29:19 up a bit, not as much as like the video seemed to be implying at the beginning when I actually
00:29:23 watched further. But like he is like a big, you know, a fucking brutish kind of yell allowed
00:29:30 silly man. And he does seem a little more like wise in the, in the Japanese translation or whatever.
00:29:37 But I mean, in either case, I just want to go on record is saying like Barrett Wallace is like
00:29:42 one of the greatest characters of all time. I love him so much. He is so sick. And I said this
00:29:48 in my video, but when you do the first, the opening bombing mission, Barrett's like this piece of
00:29:52 shit asshole, like sure he fights with you. Okay, great. But he's yelling at you the whole time.
00:29:56 He's a big bully. But then you get home and you see Barrett run to Marlene and pick her up and
00:30:01 carry it around for like a train ride or whatever. And you're like, yes, kill Sheenra. They must all
00:30:07 burn, protect Marlene. It's like the greatest moment of all time. It's so good. And and like,
00:30:15 I'm sorry, but like Barrett yelling loud and like being I don't know what negatively stereotypically
00:30:20 black. Look, maybe you can make a case for that. I care so little about that compared to what a
00:30:26 great person Barrett is and how much I love him. So I mean, just what am I supposed to be mad about
00:30:32 to anybody who has that concern? I don't know. I don't know.
00:30:36 He's like the greatest. He's the opposite of the stereotypical black guy who bans his children
00:30:41 because this isn't his biological child. He adopted Marlene. He's a very, he's a very complex
00:30:47 character. Like he's morally very complicated. He's an eco terrorist. He kills innocent people
00:30:51 for the greater good. I mean, I mean, and he's also a single father. He has a heart. He's like
00:30:56 he's like a smart guy. Like really, it's shallow to see him as a black caricature when he's very
00:31:02 much I was just going to say it's so again, like I'll give people a chance to get but I did see
00:31:07 a little bit of this. It's so games journalism core to just read some of Barrett's like intro
00:31:13 dialogue and make a judgment on the character based just on that when like you got me and Jesse
00:31:18 out here like like nearly in tears just thinking about what a hero Barrett is and what a great
00:31:25 father he is and what a great person he is. It's so weird that like the the idea is that like black
00:31:29 people now aren't allowed to be stereotypically black. I mean like well people people who are
00:31:35 stereotypically black do exist. It's a you know and he's not just that he's also that and so much
00:31:42 more but people are going to look at it's the real racist those game journalism tier core
00:31:47 assholes they're going to look at it and go out he's just he's just a he's just a you know
00:31:51 he's a he's a buffer he's a fucking and so they're saying the racist thing you can't call Barrett
00:31:56 a buffer you fucking came through you're the racist. Is that wait I don't know what's a buffer
00:32:02 it's my it's a word that I use and I've never heard anyone else use and I don't know. Is that
00:32:08 that thing about like the people from the other half of Michigan? No I think I'm pretty sure that
00:32:12 buffer just means like poor people like dirty lazy poor people and that's how I've used it forever
00:32:20 but I mean what's what's the one I'm thinking of like there's two halves of Michigan and one oh
00:32:26 that's that you're talking you talk about Ubers what Ubers people from the UP yeah yeah Ubers yeah
00:32:32 that's the one that's that's what I was thinking okay okay well hey this this thing about okay like
00:32:38 on a certain level I can understand why people will immediately see Barrett's dialogue and at
00:32:42 least raise questions okay I like I get it but uh like beyond that it reminds me it's like the
00:32:47 same thing with Tifa basically that like okay so yes Tifa canonically Tifa has massive tits uh like
00:32:54 in the cutscenes they're even bigger those may or may not be like quote unquote canon I guess
00:32:58 but we know she has large tits this is established um so like let's just say that she had absolutely
00:33:05 massive tits that were kind of crazy uh like beyond the pale like the CG stuff in ff7 like I'm just
00:33:11 there are women in real life who have those so like it's it's a little bit odd to say
00:33:16 like we can't show those I think um or that we would change it that's like somewhat reasonable
00:33:21 it was like uh with her body type I those wouldn't be natural because that's just not how it goes I mean
00:33:30 that from from what I've heard absolutely women who have oh well okay but can't we can't we at least
00:33:36 agree that there's gotta be some women if you look at Tifa's okay I know I said like crazy tits size
00:33:41 but if we look at her more reasonable tits size like in uh in the original inter like combat model
00:33:46 they're they're big but they're not like crazy big but they definitely stand out and are noteworthy
00:33:51 there are absolutely women I mean millions I'm sure throughout the world who have tits that are
00:33:55 that are that size and look approximately I mean don't don't women who have big tits deserve to be
00:34:01 represented as well yeah I mean obviously they're the argument because they're the colonizing people
00:34:09 they're the ones they're the ones who oppress the other minorities on the body it wouldn't just
00:34:15 all go to the tits it just that's not how a body works are you saying that it's impossible that
00:34:20 there's a woman who's skinny with big tits could it never happen I mean I've seen in real life but
00:34:25 do you know if they're real are we are are we saying that Dolly Parton doesn't even matter if they're
00:34:28 really valid as a person the saint that is Dolly Parton listen I don't look at girls with boobs
00:34:34 since you often so I wouldn't know I'm just I'm playing devil's advocate here to major's point
00:34:41 too many just points let's let's think about this let's break this down reasonably I mean
00:34:50 it's probably I'm sure it's it's not impossible that a that a female could look like Tifa and and
00:34:59 well okay I was gonna say and perform like I mean they can't like fucking summon meteors
00:35:03 or whatever like she does with her fists or whatever yeah like summon dolphins get summon
00:35:06 dolphins with like a hand-to-hand combo or whatever but you know be a pugilist right all right but
00:35:15 I don't play devil's advocate here but why does she look like that why I mean it's not it's not
00:35:21 because I mean she looks like that there's an answer and I'll tell you people with I know the
00:35:26 answer see mm-hmm uh-huh so it's yeah in the game there's two central female characters
00:35:35 Aris and Tifa and I think the entire point of these two characters is that their personalities
00:35:40 are not how they outwardly appear Tifa looks like a bimbo with big titties and she's very shy
00:35:46 and very insecure whereas Aris looks like a demure like a nice girl next door and she's very outgoing
00:35:53 and kind of like hey let's you know touch my butt please sir so like they are the two characters
00:36:00 I think are meant to be a deliberate subversion of like not how they appear at first glance so I
00:36:05 think that is actually the real reason why she looks like that why she has big boobs that's
00:36:10 interesting and I can see that I can appreciate that so I think it's safe to say that there's not
00:36:17 zero reason that everyone looks like it everyone knows that Eryth it's all about that compensated
00:36:22 dating lifestyle yeah you know you guys know what I'm talking about I think I'm understanding you Ben
00:36:27 and I reject this meme because it's hurtful to my feelings about Aris she's selling a flower she's
00:36:33 selling a flower for one deal that's not a sustainable business model that's a dog whistle
00:36:38 that's a dog whistle I didn't read a dojin I read like an article explaining that this is like a thing
00:36:43 in in Asian cultures or something I don't know man whatever we meet Aris she's not a prostitute
00:36:51 this is how do you know how do you know I feel like it would come up at some point why would it
00:36:56 come up I don't I guess it might not well the flower thing is honestly the only thing but I mean
00:37:06 maybe you could say it's a strong case to be fair at one point in the game they are all prostitutes
00:37:11 even cloud that's true that's true but I mean I mean she lives she lives in like a fucking
00:37:17 she lives in like the poorest slum in the in midgard she is you know she lives in like a
00:37:22 fucking broken-ass church with a hole in the roof with like no no no she just visits that
00:37:26 wouldn't that mean though Ben that one gill would be would go pretty far in a broken economy like
00:37:31 well look it it's maybe it's sorry I mean doesn't a potion cost like 50 I don't know it's literally
00:37:37 never played you know that's I'm just saying that's the kind of neighborhood that's that's
00:37:41 definitely the kind of neighborhood where people would be I mean it's not even prostitution proper
00:37:48 it's like it's like prostitution adjacent yeah okay I will say this it is it's sort of implied
00:37:54 that because eris is etc and she has this connection to the earth that's why like flowers and life
00:38:00 tends to grow around her in places that she frequents yeah where it would normally it's not
00:38:04 flowers don't grow in this crappy city but at her house right she's got a huge garden of flowers
00:38:08 in the church there's a patch where flowers grow because she's there all the time so yeah it is
00:38:13 she is selling the flowers for cheap but she has a lot of flowers so I think it could be sustainable
00:38:18 because flowers just grow around her eris is I believe eris is 21 if I remember correctly 22
00:38:25 22 that's right because she's the one who's older and her cloud's mom says she's a fucking
00:38:29 christmas cake uh unfortunately she's not past the 25th Ben come on she's getting there she's
00:38:36 getting there she's only got three good years left we don't know what eris's mom does uh so maybe
00:38:41 she has a stable income you know as a sheen or employee maybe her mom is the prostitute yeah
00:38:45 she wouldn't live there she had a good gig
00:38:49 well you know a good gig at the honey be in as the milk the rest of the milk I mean I'm sure like
00:38:53 regardless they wouldn't have been able to even imply that in a video game
00:39:01 on the contrary they could only imply it well yeah I mean but like they didn't
00:39:07 well you know like not explicit there's no explicit implication that she could be a prostitute
00:39:11 look I don't think I don't think I'm not saying I'm not here to argue it's canon I'm just saying
00:39:15 you could probably read that into it if you felt like it and you wouldn't be wrong I suppose that's
00:39:20 fair Nate you did bring up the one thing uh the remake is bad and I want them to change absolutely
00:39:26 nothing and everything they change will upset me but you did bring up like if there's one thing
00:39:32 about final fantasy seven that I would update and change it would be to age up all of the characters
00:39:37 because in hindsight when I was a kid and I read in the instruction manual like clouds 21
00:39:43 that felt like to me oh he's an adult he's a grown-up now that I'm fucking almost 30 I look back and
00:39:49 I'm like 21 year olds are fucking children and I don't care what they're doing I don't care about
00:39:54 their problems because they're idiots they have no brains they have no uh they have no sentience
00:39:59 at all so like if I could change one thing I would just make the characters adults not like
00:40:03 mccloud at least 25 well hey just just for the record for the record yeah go on go on I I feel
00:40:10 that's so hard and I feel like it's like okay stop me if this is weird but I sort of feel like becoming
00:40:18 an old man has made me understand the arguments for like why aren't there more you know people of
00:40:24 color in media because I feel the same way about old people oh yeah absolutely like like the fact
00:40:29 that everyone's a fucking kid in all my Japanese anime is I'm like I can't relate to this shit
00:40:34 where's my relatable protagonist yeah I'm so sick of hearing about teenagers problems and like 20
00:40:40 year olds adventures they're none of them matter get that shit away from me it's it's media not for
00:40:46 us it's like sometimes I watch anime and you're like hello uh I am currently saving the world I'm
00:40:50 finding demons I'm killing people and I'm only 14 years old I'm like well this is why I mean
00:40:56 I mean if I'm if I'm watching if I'm like I can kind of like pretend that someone like I don't
00:41:00 know it sort of doesn't matter how old someone is in a certain sense because like as long as they're
00:41:04 an adult they it depends on the story they might act the same but at the same I like I see someone
00:41:08 doing something and they're like under 20 and I'm like I can't take it's hard for me to take you
00:41:13 seriously I mean there's certain context in which sorry sorry to all the zoomers in my audience
00:41:17 it probably like can you just I'd rather I'd rather the world end I would rather the world
00:41:22 end than be saved by a 20 year old that's understandable the thing is in most anime and
00:41:28 manga and video games uh unless the the graphics are super realistic you can't tell and the only
00:41:35 thing that will make you feel that is the number yeah yeah and so if you don't know the number you
00:41:39 will like the one piece characters are like like in the early 20s when I when I when I think age
00:41:45 is usually young just to attract you know the younger audience but uh it's still meant to be
00:41:50 relatable for the older audience unless you know I guess this has never personally bothered me I've
00:41:55 never really thought about ages is like accurate like they're just they're literally just because
00:41:59 like even if you have like a 16 year old protagonist they're still acting way above their their age
00:42:05 let's not let's not forget that in the old days folks uh like people used to mature a lot faster
00:42:10 than they do now like Alexander the Great was what like 18 when he conquered the world so you know
00:42:16 we've really infantilized ourselves what did you do with your life
00:42:19 when I when I when I read a character when there's a character that I like
00:42:22 conquered the world of warcraft and and then like I I look into it and I find out like oh my god
00:42:28 this person's like 21 I'm like ah shit just like that takes together Ben that's all I actually
00:42:34 what do you mean take something it takes something away from it for me I actually remember the first
00:42:38 time of the age anatomy bothered me I think I think I was like 16 or 17 and and I this is the
00:42:45 first time I came across Tokyo Mew Mew and I found out that the main main girl was like 12 years old
00:42:52 I think and I just sort of like what a minute yeah that's a little that's like surprisingly young
00:42:58 for like anyone to do anything I mean the Sailor Moon is like 13 isn't she and I'm just like wait
00:43:04 is she really yeah yeah yeah yeah look we're talking about the wrong side of this equation
00:43:09 right now because we're talking about how like anime is is has all these young people we need to
00:43:14 talk about how real life has all the young people now like there are people on youtube who are
00:43:18 multi-millionaires at like 18 or 19 that's that's the real problem my boy James Charles
00:43:23 killing the game right now 19 years old you can you you can fucking have and destroy a career
00:43:28 before you turn 20 you know likes to imitate your art at this point uh what's the I want to study
00:43:34 the life of like I'm gonna shout out uh acro acro station because like I never really think of them
00:43:40 as being young because I get along with them so well yeah and that 10 years younger than I am
00:43:45 they're like almost 16 whoa I had no idea isn't it crazy how the internet has like made it so
00:43:52 like people can like learn how to do things and gain an audience and get clout at like
00:43:57 I said in the old days I think it's really cool and I like the fact that I can like have
00:44:02 like a cool like like friends of all different ages and nobody thinks about it because it's
00:44:06 a crazy idea what if we didn't like shackle like development of a human being to like a rigid
00:44:13 societal structure that's like by this year you'll do this yes by this year you'll how about we
00:44:18 just don't do that that's exactly what the internet should be doing personalized learning
00:44:21 development I mean yeah exactly for sure I guess I mean I have to enjoy all the consequences
00:44:27 the peer the peer pressure of seeing people your age and like middle school accomplishing things
00:44:33 it lets you let you know it's real and it can happen for you and gives you more motivation
00:44:39 it should it should be a contest I mean when I was in like high school I didn't think I could do
00:44:44 anything exactly that was our problem that was our big downfall we didn't have a society that
00:44:49 reinforced that possibility like I dreamed about doing things at 16 but I didn't know it was possible
00:44:55 I think we also we were not necessarily that I wasn't one who grew up from like little childhood
00:45:00 with the internet which gave possibilities because back when I was younger the idea of being an artist
00:45:07 was still like you know easels and paintings the idea that I could be a digital artist like
00:45:13 was never something I could have even considered to become yeah that's that's exactly my point we
00:45:19 just we were all we all the possibility wasn't there so we never even considered it we just played
00:45:24 Final Fantasy 7 got really invested we sure did I think but not me I didn't play it at all I still
00:45:29 haven't yeah I haven't either Tom just sat there staring at the wall doing nothing I don't necessarily
00:45:34 feel like inadequate or like underachieved compared to like other people in my age bracket but like
00:45:40 I often like I genuinely wonder like am I less successful than other people my age or am I like
00:45:46 way more successful like I I think I might kind of like I think it depends on the metric like
00:45:52 think of all the people that you've reached with your with your content yeah I mean like
00:45:55 very well loved so yes I'm homeless and yes I'm a youtuber which are both knocks against me I suppose
00:46:01 of course but I mean like I have created a lot of art that is good and that people like a lot of
00:46:07 people like so doesn't that make me and like I do have some money not like a lot but like I have
00:46:13 a little bit of money in the bank and I have a car and yeah and I'm not like autistic so I'm
00:46:19 automatically like in the night in like 90% most successful top 1% yeah yeah exactly this is a real
00:46:25 1% or the non-autistic yeah we have to redistribute the autism it's only fair I can't I can't join
00:46:31 you there unfortunately I'm like uh I mean I'm I probably make uh I mean I make less money
00:46:40 than like all my friends but like like like all but I think there's a lot of people who would
00:46:45 you know like to do what I do yeah yeah I mean the thing I've always the thing I've always held
00:46:50 on to is that like me and like all of us because we're doing this like online thing where we might
00:46:54 be poor in money but we're rich in time and I think time's way more valuable you know I'm I'm I mean
00:47:00 I'm transitioning to a period where I mean I'm leaving my job in like a month and a half or
00:47:04 whatever and so I will be that's the whole point I'm selling my job I saved up money to get that
00:47:10 precious time to try to work on shit and yeah so it'll be interesting to see if I can manage it
00:47:15 you know that's kind of that's kind of what I did like I don't know I'm not not to the extent
00:47:20 like that you did but like there I did go through I went through a period of like I was I was tutoring
00:47:25 a lot and I and I and I worked a little job and I and I saved up some money so that I could you
00:47:30 know spend a whole bunch of time just working on like this is what this is when I was working on
00:47:34 Vapors one I think I was like now I've got like I've got enough money in the bank that I can make
00:47:38 it through rent for like a while and I did you know and I was like okay I'm gonna I'm gonna
00:47:44 invest this money that I've saved up in you know having the time to work on this thing and kind of
00:47:50 get my sort of art career off the ground with like my first big project and I think that worked out
00:47:57 pretty well not yeah not not it certainly is a appreciated word about that investment uh-huh
00:48:04 yeah I am pretty much hope to do the same but you know on the subject of like raising our kids
00:48:10 you know I think that our when our generation as kids when we have kids here I mean you know I
00:48:15 always wonder like how much does a generation learn like we all think that we're gonna do things
00:48:21 better and different from our parents I'm skeptical as to how much you actually like do in fact do
00:48:26 differently but like if there's one lesson I would like to take away it's that I think that like
00:48:30 the millennials I mean I'm not even making a judgment but they seem like relatively like the
00:48:33 coddled shelter generation in many ways not just you know not like whatever I'm just saying that
00:48:38 like I think with us I hope to and I'm seeing more I'm seeing these guys like um there's this one
00:48:44 guy who's really into like having free range kids and people like raise their free range kids well
00:48:50 well just let set him loose in a field and see what Jonathan height his name is Jonathan height
00:48:55 what does that mean though okay his whole idea is that like okay he's got like a daughter he
00:48:59 lives in New York City in like a very safe place and like his daughter is like I think like wait
00:49:03 did you say that New York City is a very safe place no he lives in a safe place in New York City like
00:49:08 not every neighborhood is bad or good he happens to live in a I mean this is what he says so I'm
00:49:12 taking him at his word sure um and so Jonathan height so like he'll do things like he'll give his
00:49:16 daughter like a $20 bill and say go to the store like it's like three blocks away and so like you
00:49:21 know in New York she'll like go down buy things and come back I mean it's the middle of the day
00:49:25 like statistically these things are very rare to happen and just like by getting your kid to do
00:49:30 this they you know if you do it regularly they get a bunch of life experience they learned like oh
00:49:34 here's life out here this is super important because I think we have this idea that like
00:49:39 children at certain ages are capable of only so much when really it's only because we're only letting
00:49:44 them do that much you know yeah like like back back in the day like 13 year olds were like killing
00:49:49 people and fighting in battles they'd be breeding like rabbits is what so I mean I knew how to use
00:49:56 an iPad by like h3 or 4 exactly they do that stuff yeah yeah I did navigate like youtube and
00:50:05 and find the videos you wanted to watch children are way more capable than we give them credit for
00:50:10 and if you just like let your kid like get life experiences early he will become a god among his
00:50:14 generation but I mean that's why I'm going to be the best father ever by siring dozens of children
00:50:19 all over the world and raising none of them letting them find their own fucking way to grow up in
00:50:23 whatever country or part of the planet for the number two headband so that they can challenge
00:50:28 you exactly you know just like my my hero the man I aspire to be like in all things uh Ujiro Hanma
00:50:35 from Baki the grappler I only want to be defeated by my son by my strongest son I want him to find
00:50:42 me and kill me yeah yeah yeah you sire the child you make the child you leave a treasure map with
00:50:49 the wife and then you go on your merry way and then like 20 years later um the the the sun's
00:50:55 learned about the map and they go on to to converge on a secret island in the middle of the pacific
00:51:01 where you will be you will be waiting on a throne I will be hosting a mortal combat tournament
00:51:06 to see which to see which of my children can finally kill me
00:51:10 that's so cool I hope that happens hey I distinctly remember like um
00:51:16 the talking about like raising kids just one what one more time uh that my parents or especially
00:51:23 my mother was like extremely scared of me going outside um because of I assume I I never really
00:51:32 looked into it but I assume it was just sort of like high-profile kidnappings murders uh that
00:51:37 were in the news that caused people to be like you know keep your kids inside there's dangerous
00:51:42 people around and that was just sort of like permeated through all the parents who were raising
00:51:47 kids at the time social media it's all up in our ears so we're thinking about all the time and yeah
00:51:52 like uh so it was like not a normal thing for me to leave the house on my own so I just never did
00:51:59 I would always go like uh to to the park or whatever when there was a family outing and
00:52:04 then I was like 16 and like I had I felt the need to like ask my parents if it was okay for me to
00:52:11 go for a walk and they they thought I was weird and I was like but but you've raised me like
00:52:16 yeah they raised you that way so I didn't know this was weird I was wait it was weird to go for a
00:52:22 walk or to ask to ask it was weird for me yeah to ask permission to go on a walk I was I was like
00:52:27 I was just like 16 like like I obviously I was a bit too old to be feeling like I'm not allowed
00:52:34 to go out the house it's not like they ever told me I can't go out but I just never felt the urge
00:52:39 to go out because of like um you know this implication that children do not go outside you
00:52:44 and do not go outside it's dangerous you'll die it instantly I mean it's it's like you could be
00:52:50 what if you're the one case in like a million where you get kidnapped and throw into a sex
00:52:53 dungeon gang banged for decades uh you know but like what could happen putting it like that sounds
00:52:59 pretty funny I mean I'm sort of sort of similar but not but not at all I guess I have yeah not at
00:53:09 all I have it of actually announcing when I'm coming in or leaving the house it was like if I'm
00:53:15 yeah you say uh it's very wait no no it was not before even anime was the thing I would always
00:53:21 like announce that I'm leaving or entering just weeb from the womb to die just just to let my parents
00:53:27 know but the thing is I never asked for permission I would just be like I'm going and right yeah like
00:53:33 I think from a very young age I never was really supervised when I went outside I was told to like
00:53:40 play in the neighborhood and the neighborhood's kind of big and sometimes I did disobey the rule
00:53:45 and go outside the neighborhood but they would never know because they weren't there to supervise
00:53:49 me so I'm somehow alive I mean that's the thing the vast majority of everyone you were almost
00:53:59 kidnapped oh yeah no big deal wait wait wait wait don't just fucking gloss over that yeah what
00:54:05 happened what happened I don't remember too well because I was quite young like six or so and I
00:54:11 was just like I was walking by it was near the neighborhood and I think that it was back when
00:54:18 it used to be like there was this um abandoned store well it was used to be this was before the
00:54:23 bomb it used to be it used to be like a pizza place and there were like two adult guys just
00:54:28 like eating pizza god pizza gate and I was walking by and I think I had a balloon in my hand and
00:54:33 they were like oh that's a cute balloon I was like yeah and I said hey thanks and it matches my t-shirt
00:54:39 and um not that I'm remembering it sounds really terrible what they said next but like my student
00:54:46 had didn't understand and they said like oh you know you're kind of cute yesterday we could never
00:54:52 girl just like you and I'm like okay wait I'm just I'm just curious is it possible this guy was like
00:55:14 was like in a way joking like just trying to like spook you for fun because that's a weird thing to
00:55:20 I don't know I'll never know is this is this when you took your spiked baseball bat and just beat
00:55:24 the shit out of this man until he was dead yeah how old how old are you like no more than seven I'd
00:55:32 say okay okay I'm gonna say I'm gonna go out on the limb and say that probably it was just a weird
00:55:38 joke yeah like like you know is that so so crazy from like when I came back home I told my mom about
00:55:50 it and and she just look I never saw my mom so scared yeah is it so weird from like an old person
00:55:58 that's like oh I'm gonna gobble you up I mean there it's a little more on the nose I mean I had to
00:56:04 translate and just like the way I'm remembering it seems ominous but at that time I didn't understand
00:56:12 yeah I get you you walk home with a balloon you say to your mother hey mom what's kidnapping
00:56:20 what does that mean yeah and she like puts down her fucking spat she's like what what happened
00:56:27 tell me everything I kidnapped these guys that they're coming to live in my house now
00:56:34 I'm remembering the source of incredible of my neighborhood boy how am I alive how
00:56:40 I don't know you well clearly you're you're very much an enigma I mean there are the
00:56:46 mage your your lifelong devotion of purple the patron saint of purple has protected you all this
00:56:51 time yeah the the life of your like mad max fucking road warrior apocalypse apocalypse wandering
00:57:00 like bombed out cityscape scavenging for goods and resources have I told you guys about like
00:57:05 that there were like a drug dealers living in my neighborhood apparently I mean I can imagine
00:57:10 not so strange this drug dealers right around the corner for me right now that's not so strange
00:57:14 I'm a drug dealer I dare you insult my people like that but like you know they do the shady
00:57:21 scary kind I'm not talking about we sure yeah like not wholesome friendly kinds like I mean I think
00:57:26 you'd probably wielding machetes and shotguns and then jumping out from behind the bushes and
00:57:31 going where drugs yeah and there was also not you're kind of cute I got a girl just like you
00:57:39 addicted to heroin yesterday in a neighborhood not too far from mine but I never went there
00:57:47 because I had no reason to there was a rumor that like there was a kid around my age I guess at least
00:57:53 you know I I don't believe this I necessarily because you know kids tend to lie but apparently
00:57:59 there was like this guy something similar to a Lithuanian mafia boss and he had a kid around our
00:58:04 age and yeah like you had to and like they were you know he had to pay a nice to this guy or else
00:58:10 you know you know he had in trouble or so or so they say but I really don't think the guy would
00:58:14 hurt like kids that are like seven or eight years old just because they were mean to his
00:58:19 friend no he just had you get kidnapped you know that was that was his plan one of the
00:58:25 quote unquote get kid one of the guys I live with works at like a deli and I mean I just
00:58:30 have his word for this but apparently it's run by someone who is like mafia adjacent like I think
00:58:37 that the deli is on the level like it's not like a crime deli or anything but supposedly the guy who
00:58:42 owns it is like a mob guy well it's not a front he just has a legitimate business I haven't heard
00:58:49 anything about it being a front just like the deli he just sells meats and cheese on the side
00:58:55 you know if things go south they gotta have a backup plan yeah exactly you know if the money
00:59:00 dries up in this whole crime thing all right there was there was something I wanted to kind of bring
00:59:05 up to kind of bring it back to what we were talking about with like uh like people having more options
00:59:10 for like being creative and doing it quicker I was wondering do you think that because our generation
00:59:16 was so coddled and we never had to worry about any of that kind of shit because it was all taken care
00:59:21 of for us that that's what allowed a lot of this technology to spring up and have it be possible
00:59:27 for like people 10 years younger than us to have all these opportunities like we weren't
00:59:31 worrying about oh you mean like the the digital arms race is was bolstered by the fact that
00:59:36 everybody needed these apps because they couldn't function normally um I mean I guess it's one
00:59:42 possibly the way I was kind of presenting it was just that because we never had to like
00:59:46 sweat the essentials or like figure out how to function because our parents were doing it for us
00:59:49 and like left us to be eternal dreamers and make all these like services that allowed us to kind of
00:59:54 pursue more creative things hard hard to say I definitely think there's something to that I
01:00:00 don't know like because I don't I don't like do you do I don't really see our parents like ever
01:00:05 even coming up with concepts like this even like an analog equivalent you know like that that was
01:00:09 never because like I don't know about you guys but like most of the like like my parents like
01:00:13 they they're always much more grounded and like get a real job get an employment that's more
01:00:17 more rational don't strike out on your own or anything like that uh but like because like
01:00:22 they're so they were so coddling when we growing up like it just left me with all this like time
01:00:27 to think and dream and want to do more than just like do nothing I don't know I feel like it's just
01:00:32 that the like the internet has made it so that like it's it's such a game changer because it's
01:00:37 difficult to have like an analog equivalent for an easy way for somebody to get published and
01:00:43 have everybody see it without going through a publisher like there's no real analog way to do
01:00:48 that on the internet it's completely different so it's it's tough to say man it's because it's
01:00:53 such a different paradigm you know I don't know like that whole that whole super prevalent notion
01:00:58 that like the millennials are a coddle generation like I don't get it I don't relate to it at all
01:01:03 I think it's totally bullshit I mean like how can millennials be like the coddle generation and at
01:01:09 the same time be the generation that's totally fucked all the time by everything well they're
01:01:14 fucked a particular way I I feel like maybe we were coddled a little bit like we you know we didn't
01:01:21 like go out and like run around in the neighborhood and so but then again we didn't grow up in like
01:01:26 in like a place where there was a lot of shit to do I mean it's a weird generalization to say
01:01:31 that a generation is is coddled or any certain way because I mean like there's poor people and
01:01:35 rich people in every generation I think yeah it's it's not like the people are coddled it's that
01:01:42 back in the day there were only so many things people did because there wasn't so much stuff to do
01:01:48 with the advent of video games and like taking up like like so great like video games are great
01:01:54 and they've been just like an incredible medium they're just sprang up and now we have those
01:02:01 and they're obviously very distracting and take up a lot of our time and cause us to not go outside
01:02:06 like I don't think it's like that we were coddled but we were distracted by so many
01:02:10 incredible things that we were being made I think I think coddle's not the right way maybe
01:02:14 shielded might be a better word for it well it's not like our parents were doing it because like
01:02:19 like the parents of the people like the older generations are the one who's who are saying
01:02:23 we're coddled because we can't like like you know very generally speaking uh like have less like
01:02:29 we don't use telephones that much we don't like talking on this on the phone but it's not it's
01:02:34 not because like napkins we don't go on luxury cruises it's not because we're like scared it's
01:02:40 not like on the whole we're scared of these things it's because we've like there have been
01:02:44 things invented that are better than they're not they're not we're not interested yeah it's because
01:02:48 we're smarter and we're more frugal because we fucking had to be can I just say that I think the
01:02:54 idea of a luxury cruise is like the most deplorable thing oh god I almost went on one I was so close
01:03:01 to going on a luxury cruise last year because fuck wait how because so the the wrestler Chris Jericho
01:03:08 put together his own rock and wrestling rager at sea where like he was gonna okay like okay this was
01:03:14 like a big thing they were gonna be like like famous wrestlers like wrestling matches on the
01:03:18 ship they were gonna be like rock bands like fucking fozzy which is his rock band and probably like
01:03:22 other ones it was just gonna be like a big like a three-day concert slash wrestling event on the
01:03:28 ocean and like tickets were like like 1200 for like a good cabin and like I was so fucking close to
01:03:34 getting it and I got talked out of it at the last minute like he's too much money and I'm so angry
01:03:38 that I was talked out of it but luckily he's he's doing another one there's gonna be a rocket ranger
01:03:42 at sea too and this time I'm fucking going no matter what nothing will stop me oh you gotta be there
01:03:49 dude well that sounds pretty neat there's an exception to every rule as they say it's just like
01:03:56 in general the idea is like spend a shit ton of money for like three days where you don't have to
01:04:02 like do your own laundry or whatever I don't yeah I guess it's like going to the beach but if you feel
01:04:09 like it the luxury cruise thing I've always felt like you know go like have a nice day at the beach
01:04:17 except you're in a prison ship you can't go home when you are in a fucking prison but there's lots
01:04:22 of activities to do you gotta look in the bright side I don't look in the bright side I don't want
01:04:26 to like this thing like I don't want to be tempted by this weird nonsense you gotta you gotta think
01:04:31 of the target demographic if you're like a boomer and like all you do is like worry about your lawn
01:04:36 and shit I'm sure that's a great respite from like spending the weekend like trimming the hedges
01:04:40 or whatever the fuck old people but then you come home and you've got a real long lawn you've got to
01:04:43 do double exactly exactly I guess the fact that you gotta weigh the way the pros and cons like
01:04:48 like you literally can't do anything like you can't leave you don't get phone reception probably most
01:04:53 of the time oh man if that's being a boomer sign me up hey man if this is being a boomer chain me to
01:05:00 a wall
01:05:06 god can you imagine if I went on a fucking on a wrestling rock and roll cruise and there was
01:05:12 like a titanic situation and that's how I died what a perfect death that's how I want to go out
01:05:17 I want people to say forever whatever happened to endless just oh he died on a rock and roll
01:05:21 wrestling pirate ship well dude remember at the end of titanic when the the the band's just like
01:05:27 gentlemen it's been an absolute honor and they're like just playing as
01:05:30 shit goes down as it's going around the rock and roll band well what I'm what I'm seeing what I'm
01:05:35 seeing happening is like snaps the ship in half you got you got lifeboats but there's not enough
01:05:40 so you gotta fucking fight for him you got a lot of people throwing each other over the top of the
01:05:49 last man standing it's the one lifeboat everyone's like is like I've been training my whole life
01:05:53 for this and then they flex so hard that they rip through their shirt and like
01:05:57 oh god if you don't think there's any such thing as a glorious death then you haven't fucking been
01:06:02 on the rock and wrestling rager at sea it's like that's that's the selling point it's like come to
01:06:08 the rock and wrestling cruise for a glorious death like we will cruise for three days and then we
01:06:14 will fucking blow our a hole in our hull and sink you know if my two options on going on a cruise
01:06:20 were to one either emerge a champion who had defeated all my rivals or to die a glorious death
01:06:25 those both sound like great outcomes there's only there's only one lifeboat and that's the prize
01:06:32 the prizes you get to live a champion yeah that's right it's the only prize worth fighting for
01:06:37 it's on international waters so no one can convict you of anything you you do in the process of
01:06:42 attaining it is is the whole international waters thing like the same as like uh if the teachers
01:06:47 50 minutes late who are legally allowed to leave is not like the same level of legitimacy or is
01:06:51 that actually true i don't know that yeah it's because i think um nobody can i think it's known
01:06:59 as international waters is is that um people can you know technically see what you're doing with
01:07:04 murder and stuff but uh you know different countries would argue different things over there so
01:07:10 everyone just agrees that that's we're not gonna bother because nobody has we start arguing over
01:07:14 patches of water it would be like a big a big mess i just i don't i don't buy the movie trope
01:07:20 that like if you sail out far enough and you're technically in international waters you can just
01:07:24 like kill someone i mean i love no one can convict me i believe that on the simpsons on the simpsons
01:07:29 they did that thing were like they couldn't like sell booze until they were in international waters
01:07:33 but selling booze is a far cry from like you know the other shit so that one seems that i totally
01:07:38 believe yeah well yeah jesse can answer the question for us when he sabotages the cruise ship
01:07:43 once they hit international waters we'll see what happens yeah because like of all the cruises
01:07:47 that have gone into international waters i don't know if any that broke into like mass murder
01:07:51 sprees because like law you're legally allowed to kill that guy yeah it's just a gong this is
01:07:56 like a gong and a cannon blast happens right now you can kill like everybody gets their daggers
01:08:03 that they've been concealing man i can't wait for this movie adaptation from hollywood to come out
01:08:08 it sounds like a great option just fucking death death ship that'd be great can't wait to watch it
01:08:12 i bet that exists gotta rise to be kaiji now that i think about it uh didn't that happen kaiji
01:08:18 well kind yeah kind of i mean they weren't competing to kill each other but the losers ended
01:08:22 up getting sold into basically like human slavery slash like they became like medical testing
01:08:27 guinea pigs or some some shit i don't know yikes yikes boy kaiji kaiji's good it's great
01:08:35 it's a good program recommended speaking of program speaking of kaiji speaking of anime speaking
01:08:41 of animation i was like i animated i animated um a gun girl doing a little jump down and shoot
01:08:50 thing dude yeah it's fucking sick yeah yeah yeah it's really good how long did that take
01:08:55 it's for the the thing the the crown prince map uh multi animator project there's so many things
01:09:03 that map stands for now we have to say i can think of a few that are not it's always it's always
01:09:07 misanthropony in my heart but yeah it's it was a little thing where half the screen is black
01:09:16 you can choose the left or the right and you just have to have a character do something to the middle
01:09:20 of the screen and then everyone's animations are going to be compiled and this is going to be
01:09:26 they're all going to be interacting with each other in some way it's like a tick tock kind of
01:09:29 thing isn't that what tick tock does you know what the kind of things are okay plot twist i'm
01:09:34 going to be part of it too are you ready or how long does it clip five seconds five i think it might
01:09:45 be closed oh like the deadline was yesterday yeah i already i already submitted mine nice
01:09:52 is it posted anywhere is it a c i haven't posted it yet i uh like no one's posting it so i get i
01:09:58 guess people are keeping it a secret for the most part i'll post mine on my channel as soon as the
01:10:03 actual map is up okay how about you give okay can we get a link to yours at some point it's on
01:10:09 twitter right um i i've posted around i can post it again i just thought we'd put in the show notes
01:10:14 so people can see that'd be cool yeah i i made a tweet where red uh where red man is having one
01:10:19 of his comic moments and dunge girl jumps down and shoots him in the head excellent uh but i i
01:10:26 just uh i've been animating a lot of things and that one i feel like is the result of me having
01:10:32 been animating for weeks because it's so good and it didn't even take that long it's fucking i mean
01:10:39 the there's like little things about animation that i'm too stupid to be able to quantify in
01:10:44 technical terms but i appreciate with them when i see them and just the way that everything's
01:10:48 weighted the way the move the movement feels like it has like some sense of gravity to it and like how
01:10:54 it moves naturally like the timing so there's a little bit of like weight in between each part
01:10:58 of the action so the next one has like the right sense of movement like it's all on point it's
01:11:02 fucking great i like i like animation but it's so difficult and like um yeah it's just like i've
01:11:10 been you know like i've been working on that like five seconds animation like i went through i think
01:11:16 three or four drafts before i settled on a very simple sort of idea which was basically
01:11:24 just a little blob dude bouncing around and bouncing against the side of the screen and
01:11:29 then attacking with with like a water gun not an actual gun you know pokemon water gun thing
01:11:35 sort of thing and i had a lot of fun with the you know bouncing and then bouncing off but like like
01:11:40 it bouncing off of the screen was very difficult to do uh ollie you know to give it like um
01:11:48 like a big believable weight to it dude that's the hardest part it's super fucking difficult
01:11:56 actually speaking of animation i'm putting out a call i tweeted about this earlier but i'm putting
01:12:00 out the call on the pcp i found out that if you have a connect for the xbox one whoa and if you
01:12:08 get a you get a pc adapter for it you can use it for motion capture in 3d software and i want
01:12:14 to try it so if anybody bought an xbox one on launch and their connect is just sitting in a
01:12:19 closet somewhere i will pay for the shipping if you want to send it to me for research purposes
01:12:24 so i can motion capture make zumi do cool fucking shit uh that's a cool idea yeah i want it to
01:12:30 happen it looks right you'll you'll do like a backflip and she'll do a backflip yeah exactly and
01:12:35 then i'll break my spine and uh and then she'll break her spine it'll be sick they'll be able to
01:12:40 simultaneously whip and nae nae and it'll all be captured help help commit to my suicide if i send
01:12:45 you oh yeah yeah yeah you should definitely do that just so you can do the dab and have her
01:12:50 dad oh yeah fun one armed dab it'll be a new a new thing you got to cut off one of your arms to be
01:12:56 able to do it i feel like a one-armed dab would look like something else yeah i don't know i guess
01:13:02 we'll find out when i do it and she'd lose her left arm or right arm uh right arm right okay okay
01:13:07 you dab to the left she's a forced lefty force that southpaw oh that sucks it would still work
01:13:14 as long as you the arm that you are dabbing with is the one that goes over your face and not the
01:13:18 other one because then you just that's true making like a dramatic side pose wouldn't have the same
01:13:23 but but you yeah yeah yeah you she can manage it i'm sure thank god i have to scrap the whole
01:13:28 character if she can you know what's the point your character can't you can't what's what's even the
01:13:32 point they're useless uh are there characters without arms out there who are just totally worthless
01:13:38 now who's a character without arms uh rin from that fucking from katawa shoujo uh oh shit i guess
01:13:46 that's true um shawnee he doesn't have arms or at least we don't know it's true he don't we have
01:13:54 never seen his arms he claims that he canonically has no arms okay and uh i think he's probably the
01:14:00 authority on the matter oh uh paradox crocs only he gets them sometimes as i understand he's got he's
01:14:06 got yeah when he wants he's got arms whenever he needs them so that doesn't count okay so he's
01:14:10 got the privilege yep well fuck him he doesn't he doesn't get that uh he doesn't get the like the
01:14:16 government benefits from being harmless well is it trackmaster snake or what's his name trackpad snake
01:14:22 yeah track snake i guess he's just a snake doesn't he doesn't have like does he have like tiny little
01:14:28 arms or i think i think that's in contention i think that's that's uh an ongoing investigation
01:14:35 i i'll wait to see the the official government report on the scandal uh after it breaks all right
01:14:42 people what else is happening what else do we got we got a burn some more time before we get to the
01:14:45 voice animation just to say that uh you know gun girls cool and uh the bail jpeh thing is in coloring
01:14:54 stages they've finished all the line art do you have an estimated time of completion for this or
01:15:00 is it kind of still out of the air i don't know how long the coloring is going to take obviously it's
01:15:04 taking less time than the line art so it won't be like another three four months how it'll be like
01:15:10 maybe a week the animation maybe two weeks because like you have the the the animation is like four
01:15:14 minutes oh fuck that's a lot dude yeah it's probably too much it's probably like a big like
01:15:22 i'm stoked as fuck now i mean it was like it's it's really cool i even had to like cut some of
01:15:28 the things i wanted to do um i know that feel but like um it's a it's a really big project
01:15:36 perhaps too big um it feels like a little bit of uh i worked hard not smart on this one
01:15:45 but the results are gonna be very good and i'm excited i'm gonna be sick i'm like legit excited
01:15:50 for this yeah it's fucking cool dude how long was your other uh like uh the spider boy and the
01:15:58 the fish at the door those are much shorter is i remember correctly right those uh were like uh
01:16:04 the fish at the door was first half of year two of like half a year so six months that was
01:16:12 the other one was another six months and then you took your six months to make them
01:16:17 it the the project was six months long yeah okay i think but but both the timelines of those
01:16:23 animations were both they were much shorter than four minutes right yeah it was like a one minute
01:16:27 and then a two minute film right and then third year it was a three minute film which took
01:16:31 just going up going up a minute each time right so like doing a four minute animation
01:16:37 obviously takes a while i'm not like but uh i have the luxury of not having to do any of the
01:16:43 preliminary uh you know stuff to like right get my idea present it to the class present it to the
01:16:51 people and then go back and like rework it like i i already had a web comic going i know exactly
01:16:56 what's gonna happen all i needed to do was like write down what scenes need to happen in this in
01:17:00 this thing and then i'm doing it sick it's fucking awesome coming soon ladies and gentlemen the
01:17:07 finale coming soon speaking of uh speaking of coming soon uh Vapors 3 only has like a couple
01:17:15 more pages to go oh damn i'm not sure how to how to handle releasing here's the i don't know here's
01:17:21 what i was thinking i was thinking that maybe because like i need some time to like prepare the
01:17:28 the the Vapors 2 Kickstarter right like that's been a thing i've been planning to do for a while
01:17:33 but there's like a lot of shit that needs to happen like i need to confront for it i need to
01:17:38 write some like the like side stories for it i need to like get people on board who are willing to
01:17:43 do them and work that whole thing out i don't know i was thinking that maybe when Vapors 3 is done
01:17:48 maybe i would do like because i have the the vaporettes from the previous one i was thinking
01:17:53 maybe like every friday like for like three weeks i would release like a new uh like vaporette
01:17:59 friday vaporette friday vaporette friday and then Vapors 3 comes out and may and that buys me like
01:18:04 a month to like you know build up to making this Kickstarter or whatever because i need yeah i need
01:18:09 i need time or i don't know i thought maybe that would be like a way to build some hype for it or
01:18:13 something i think that's a good idea yeah yeah yeah i certainly look forward to them i'm looking for
01:18:18 i haven't had much you know uh it's all so ugly is if that's still the overarching brand here maybe
01:18:24 it's not maybe it's just been st i think it's just been st yeah i've been i've been hungry for content
01:18:29 for for a while yeah i gotta i gotta you know i don't like i don't just want to drop it i feel
01:18:36 like it needs hype it needs it needs a good idea i want to make it an event like it's got to be
01:18:42 i want to build up to it so i'll probably do that so i don't know in the next like in the next little
01:18:46 while i'll probably be announcing like there will probably come a day where i'm like hey guys if
01:18:51 you're listening to this that means today there were there was new like vapors content on stcomics.com
01:18:56 or whatever patreon.com so it's been st um and then i'll i don't know that that that that i'm very
01:19:02 stressed about it honestly finishing a thing is very stressful i feel like now i'm stressed yeah yeah
01:19:08 yeah well what why what about it worried that you haven't done everything perfectly perhaps or uh
01:19:15 that i'm okay i uh i have i i you know i'm ashamed of everything i've ever made uh this this
01:19:23 especially i feel that way you know whatever whatever the latest thing is that's the thing
01:19:27 that i'm most like uh how why did i do this yeah i am i'm actually dying to get a new video out so
01:19:33 that i can push this green screen meme away forever and i can forget that i ever did it look
01:19:37 forward to that yeah yeah yeah so uh ben are you experiencing completion fatigue have you ever
01:19:42 do you even know what i'm talking about maybe what what does that mean exactly for me completion
01:19:46 fatigue is when you've worked on the long project for a long time and you're at the end oh and you're
01:19:51 just like uh i don't even know like i'm barely invest i just want it i just want it done i've
01:19:55 been staring at this for so long and like yeah your height to get it out is matched by your fatigue
01:20:01 of even looking at it at the same time yeah definitely like yeah definitely it's like
01:20:07 finishing the azumi demo was hardcore completion fatigue i just like i should be a more excited
01:20:13 because it's like oh this thing i've worked on so long like it's almost done it's almost time to
01:20:18 put it out there and you know reap all the sweet sweet accolades exactly it's it's time to do
01:20:23 the thing it's time for the moment that this is all been that i've been working in service of
01:20:28 this has all been leading up to but actually i'm just it's dread it's like oh god it's almost
01:20:33 it's almost done that means that means i'm gonna have to actually show it and and like oh god no
01:20:40 now that i'm staring down the barrel of that and i'm like oh maybe this was all a mistake
01:20:44 and this was definitely all a mistake i'm shut shut it all off shut it all down the the pressure
01:20:50 of the temptation talking about a project so that this is why it's so nice to have zero
01:20:56 hype for something and then to drop it so it can be pure pure positivity and anyone who
01:21:01 criticized like well i do you fuck you man i mean i it's free and i just released it to everybody
01:21:06 so what do you complain about you can you can fall back into that i guess but as soon as there's
01:21:11 stakes narrative stakes for one's own life and and hype builds and whatnot oh it's scary oh it's
01:21:17 spooky i don't like that one but when you pull it off the rewards are worth it because you deliver
01:21:22 on hype and it makes it even bigger that's rare but yes yes i don't know why i don't feel
01:21:28 completion fatigue for this because bail jpeg i said it would be finished like at the end of 2018
01:21:33 and it's been going on for for a long time but i don't feel like it was like my fault in terms of
01:21:39 like i'm not working hard enough i've been working like constantly all the time so it's like it's just
01:21:45 a matter of time until it's finished and it's not like i'm staring at anything or a blank canvas
01:21:49 and like i don't know what to do here because i planned it out i guess i think that's the benefit
01:21:54 of like doing a release cycle for bail jpeg like you're doing uh because you you do a page or whatever
01:22:00 and then you release it because like it's different when like if you were doing bail jpeg where all of
01:22:05 it was done up to this point but none of it was released and so you just been sitting on at this
01:22:08 entire time i feel like that's a different kind of psychological pressure where you have this
01:22:13 huge backlog and nobody knows about it's you've been toiling away without any context if it's good
01:22:18 this animation is kind of like yeah because it's a lot of stuff that people haven't been
01:22:22 seeing yeah so when you're in the last like 15 seconds of the animation maybe you'll have some
01:22:27 completion fatigue or maybe you won't maybe you'll be you'll be free of the curse in which
01:22:30 case i envy you deeply because i i i really don't know why i don't feel like that i i like i'm just
01:22:37 like curious like is there is there like an element of like you don't know what comes next in in the
01:22:44 work that you're doing and you're trying to think about it or is it just like you know exactly what
01:22:48 you're doing and it's just doing it that's difficult wait you're you're talking about well how long
01:22:52 have you been working on this thing uh months okay then then yeah you should be getting it i would
01:23:00 be getting it i i find like the like the longer i work on something the more like the more depressed
01:23:06 i get because about it and in and in general because it's like oh i've spent a now i've invested
01:23:13 all this time uh like okay it doesn't even matter how successful it is or how much people like it
01:23:18 because like it still would have been better to have done the same thing faster so the longer
01:23:23 you take doing it the more it's like well you know the end product will be what it's gonna be but i
01:23:29 i've wasted more time i feel i feel like i feel like that's a losing mindset oh absolutely yeah
01:23:36 no i i would not say completion fatigue is good in any way it's a big losing mindset
01:23:42 absolutely uh needs to be overcome so if you just naturally don't have it you've ascended
01:23:46 to a higher plane and uh i'm jealous yeah but it's but it's like okay with vapors um like a page of
01:23:54 vapors it'll vary but i would say that a page generally takes no less than four but no more
01:24:00 than 12 uh hours like 12 would be pretty rare like you should probably somewhere between like
01:24:06 six to eight would probably be the average um and that and that's long and that's long enough
01:24:11 that by the end of it i'm like uh and and and the longer it goes on and the longer it goes on the
01:24:20 less i want to keep working on it and and the harder it is to like make myself you know push
01:24:25 push to the end and uh so that's like i think with bescapades i didn't get that because a
01:24:34 panel of bescapades was done in you know five minutes sometimes maybe 10 or 15 maybe half an
01:24:40 hour like a gif might take a couple hours to work on but like uh like i feel like working on
01:24:48 something there's like a sweet spot where like the the best things and the the most satisfying
01:24:53 things and the best work generally happens when you have a project and you like however long it
01:24:58 takes it's it's it's under that threshold where past which you start to be like uh because like
01:25:05 as soon as it takes long enough that that fatigue starts to set in the temptation is like i don't
01:25:09 want to look at this anymore i don't want to look at it and that just makes it take longer if you if
01:25:13 you give into that i i suppose there's there's an element of like uh going a little beyond your
01:25:21 own skill level like nothing i draw anymore is attempting to be better than what i can draw
01:25:29 like i used to think ah it's got to be perfect and then i would never do it right and now i'm just
01:25:34 you know it's more loose and more you know just whatever um but it but it still works because
01:25:41 that that like positive vibes whatever is allowing me to work longer and harder without getting
01:25:48 sort of dissatisfied with what i'm doing i think i think you've figured out a method
01:25:53 a good method here and i we could all learn from it to just not i mean i don't know i don't know
01:25:58 what's so much pressure on any method is like subject to like a personal like you know differences
01:26:05 i don't know like whether anything i could say as advice would work with ben uh probably not it's
01:26:12 it's just it's just pathological for me yeah i'm just i'm just broken um okay yeah well
01:26:21 i still have hope that maybe one day i can overcome my innate stupidity but you know
01:26:26 it gets worse with every passing day i think that the the the less uh i care about the quality of
01:26:32 my drawings the better i feel about them well yeah yeah i know what you mean because what would you get
01:26:38 what would you get what's there to bum you out if you don't give a shit you know i'm not on that
01:26:42 it's not that i don't give a shit it's just that i care less about uh i give less overshad
01:26:49 like i i understand that i'm not the best artist in the world therefore i can draw
01:26:54 like once once i managed to draw a background it's a pretty crappy background but because
01:26:59 i included the background it gave my drawing the atmosphere and i just i still love that drawing
01:27:03 i showed it to you guys because i was just so proud of my my boy right just sitting there and
01:27:08 there's like a city behind him and that's like the the crappiest fucking city just like ms paint
01:27:15 sort of a quality city well like well like um but it works i just some some something something
01:27:23 that i definitely improved at in my craft is uh not putting in too much detail on backgrounds like
01:27:31 if something's in the background you can make it it can kind of look like crap like not like crap
01:27:35 but it can be very simple you don't have to really sweat the details and if and if you've
01:27:40 composed your panel right or your image right it fades into the background and you don't have to
01:27:44 think about it too much a trap i think i've mentioned this before but i used to fall into a trap of
01:27:49 like spending way too long on like way too many details of the background of like a tiny panel
01:27:55 that like you can't even see them and i still do that sometimes but uh it's something i've overcome
01:28:02 i do it a lot less smart yeah i'm a lot more efficient now didn't you post like an image of
01:28:08 you drawing like a really extravagant white picket fence like all the way across the background
01:28:14 like kind of recently yeah there were a couple vapors panels that had a lot of a lot of a lot of
01:28:19 my car and in the driveway yeah yeah trees and buildings and like houses and a car in the background
01:28:24 and a long white picket fence and clouds and stuff i mean it looks really good thank you but i can
01:28:30 imagine that took a long time i didn't like it the only thing i like drawing are uh people
01:28:38 faces uh and and like explosions and energy like beams um things things that are moving things that
01:28:45 are like emoting uh are the only thing that's interesting trees and buildings they're boring
01:28:50 i hate them i wouldn't draw them ever if i could get away with it but i gotta set the scene like
01:28:55 and yet i spent i spend so much of the time like wait like i can draw a face i can draw like a like
01:29:00 a like maybe like a chest up face making a making an expression and maybe a hand i can draw that in
01:29:07 like minutes but then like if i have if i have to like draw the room behind them the trees in the
01:29:12 sky and stuff that's like that's that's like the real labor both literally and emotionally
01:29:20 i just can't the backgrounds they're just like i hate how bad they look and so empty i'm just
01:29:27 miserable with those kind of comic pages it you can you can like minimalism is so powerful and
01:29:34 you can go it goes a long way and it's i yeah i mean i also don't like backgrounds but i feel like
01:29:40 i mean look at the gun girl thing i posted uh the reason there's just like a groovy background
01:29:45 is because i considered drawing like the floor and i drew a line i was like i don't want to do
01:29:50 that so i didn't even draw a floor i didn't draw anything it looks great the color palette of
01:29:56 this background reminds me of my favorite scene in any cartoon which is the part in cult cartoon
01:30:02 all stars to the rescue where the kid falls down into the sewers and is chastised by michael angelo
01:30:09 or rafael or whatever the fuck one of the the ninja turtles about how doing drugs is bad and
01:30:14 the sewer sludge is like vibrant like yellow and pink for some reason he's living in like neon like
01:30:20 cheese is like what the sewer looks like and uh it's my favorite it's just my favorite thing
01:30:27 and that's what this looks like you ever feel like when it comes to all this all this kind of
01:30:32 we're talking about compromising and and you know finding ways to get around stuff i always feel like
01:30:37 such a piece of shit uh just in general when i when i concede to like okay yes the reality is
01:30:44 i cannot spend all my life on this one panel making it perfect i'm always like if life was
01:30:50 perfect if i had the time i would make this one thing like as amazing as it possibly i i dedicate
01:30:56 you know 10 000 years to honing the craft of doing this one task that i'm now going to instead
01:31:02 spend like two seconds and kind of just bullshit because you know i need to get by i feel i feel
01:31:07 the opposite yeah honestly when i when i find a corner that i can cut that doesn't like negative
01:31:14 right like when i when i when i draw a background quickly right and i don't put in a ton of detail
01:31:19 but it still looks okay i feel like i have found a shortcut i feel like i found a corner that i can
01:31:25 safely cut and i'm like yes i've shaved a little more off like i should do more of that like i need
01:31:29 to cut yeah i need to cut as many corners as possible every time i find one it's like a victory
01:31:34 time savers that don't that don't hurt quality are great because like you have you have a purpose
01:31:39 for the work and if you can find ways to deliver the work faster that doesn't sacrifice the purpose
01:31:44 then like you're working better absolutely i want to be man so a new episode of monben got released
01:31:52 or got translated you guys know monben i've talked about this right yeah i kind of forget for the
01:31:57 for the viewers and for nate i guess yeah and me it's it's or mage it's so good mage you should
01:32:04 watch it it is a show where this oh god i god i always forget his name but there's this manga guy
01:32:11 he's like a pretty famous manga guy i've heard him compared to like the steven king of manga okay he's
01:32:16 very like you know he sort of he sort of makes manga for like the the the working the working
01:32:22 man's like he just writes you just fucking churns them out and they're just very kind of middle
01:32:27 of the road like yeah anyone can appreciate this kind of manga guy he's successful he he puts he'll
01:32:34 he'll contact some other manga man or women there's a couple episodes about women um and he'll put a
01:32:40 camera in their studio and just film their studio for a week and then they'll cut down the footage
01:32:45 and he will meet with the person and they will watch the footage of them working and just like
01:32:49 comment on it and just talk about their process and talk about their workflow and and their techniques
01:32:55 and all that stuff it is so good there's some some guy has uploaded like every episode that's been
01:33:01 translated to daily motion there is um i think there's like seven or eight that are translated
01:33:06 there's more like there's more than aren't translated and i'm so mad i hope that in the description he
01:33:11 says like if you want to help me translate this contact me here i hope that people contact him
01:33:16 and help him translate because i want this i want all this shit this is i'm here for it
01:33:22 but um wait what why did i even why did i start talking about that where how did they get on
01:33:27 to mount monben oh i was just gonna say watching that like i just i just want to be like one of
01:33:33 these guys i want to be like one of these guys who puts out like a fucking chapter a week that's
01:33:37 like a dream and like i know that they i know that i can do it right because i i could be like them
01:33:45 because i don't think that people are that different right like i i think that it's not
01:33:49 some inherent difference between them and me i could be doing what they're doing and i think
01:33:53 it comes down to like a combination of one they've got the discipline you know they work at it
01:33:59 like a real job they work like eight hours a day they show up to their office and they also the fact
01:34:04 that they have an office they have like a a specific space for working that they go to and while
01:34:08 they're there they work yeah yeah i don't have that that's a problem um there is and and and also
01:34:15 like their workflow pipeline like you know a bunch some of these guys have assistance and obviously
01:34:20 they can churn out more and pass it off their assistance to finish up obviously they're gonna
01:34:23 be more efficient at getting stuff out um but not all of them like some of them are are solo
01:34:28 yeah and and yet they still and and they just you know they have a they have efficient they
01:34:33 have made their workflow pipeline as efficient as possible and i want that i want to be a content
01:34:39 machine oh don't y'all i think yeah i very much agree and yeah you get just kind of find ways to
01:34:45 achieve that like like the office thing one of my main things is currently i have like um you know
01:34:49 in my in my apartment we've got like a bedroom and then i have a separate office this is one of the
01:34:54 main things i wanted moving from the last place where we lived i live in such a tiny place my my
01:34:59 office was the bedroom and i'd be working so often while like michelle was trying to sleep
01:35:04 and recording shit and we we worked out a system but now i have an office i go to and that one
01:35:09 change i mean it the promise it's also like i mean it's where everything is like my video games
01:35:14 my computer my work stuff it's all the same place i hope to divide that up but already i have a space
01:35:19 where like now i have rooms where i can set up a green screen and like record a bunch of bullshit
01:35:23 um and do all kinds of good stuff so yeah i mean i'm just saying that i totally agree having those
01:35:28 kinds of things to facilitate the the expediency of work as well as to shift into the mindset
01:35:34 is something i definitely aspire to and one day i straight up one i want an office that i drive to
01:35:40 every morning where i film things where i record things and then at like i don't know whenever
01:35:45 i feel like it's late at night then i come home and i i'm not doing it anymore and so it's like
01:35:49 switched off yeah this is the goal for me i i do you guys remember like uh kc nice that's 368
01:35:55 program yeah we just bought this really big place i was gonna do all this stuff i have no idea what this
01:36:01 is it's like a series of vlogs like he bought a huge place in new york um where any like he
01:36:08 documented the the construction and stuff he fitted it with a kitchen and like a studio space
01:36:13 downstairs where you could record things and um it sucked all the content that he made in that place
01:36:21 it's just like boring stupid shit and i feel like it's such a waste of kc nice that having that did
01:36:26 that project like fold is he still doing that i i don't know i've i've unsubscribed because
01:36:31 every vlog is exactly the same thing and you know i mean he's fine to a degree that's nice
01:36:34 that for you yeah uh it's like the there was like this news show that uh he he had like
01:36:42 with v-source three i didn't watch any of those i didn't watch any of the actual 368 content just
01:36:46 his vlog yeah because it was really really like um tone deaf like it didn't know it didn't know how
01:36:54 to get an audience for somehow it was just like really it was exactly what you would expect from
01:37:00 a like a vlogger in terms of aesthetic yeah doing a new show right but it was really boring and it
01:37:05 was still just a new show it's just like you know there's nothing interesting there and i feel like
01:37:10 that is exactly what i would like like a pcp hq is like yeah that idea of a space where you can
01:37:17 just go downstairs and there's like you know it's it's quiet you can record there's a big space to
01:37:22 put things up yep but they just did a really bad job of it it sounds to me like those guys they
01:37:27 led with like the they should just give it to us is what i'm saying yeah we can supply the soul
01:37:33 they can supply the tech and the money and the space we've got project 368 more like project pcp
01:37:38 indeed it's happening we're making the change
01:37:42 episode 368 of the pcp when we take over should i uh should i acknowledge what did
01:37:48 you just said in the chat here what did he say uh do you want to talk he said it might be possible
01:37:52 to do rad con at my house we definitely have enough space in a way more usable space than the last
01:37:57 oh well that's certainly interesting i mean that is yes he should give us the house log so we can
01:38:01 see have we yeah has he has he done like a tour of you know i think did you was saying that he
01:38:06 doesn't want to he wants to reveal it piecemeal to like the rest of the world uh but but i think
01:38:10 perhaps for us for for these kind of technical purposes he might be willing to uh to break it
01:38:14 down yeah uh rad con right um munchy and i munchy more than me because he's already going to
01:38:21 brony con tom you're also already going to brony con yes um and i've been like humming and and
01:38:27 humming and whoring about like the idea of doing a rad con either before or immediately after uh
01:38:34 brony con 2019 in august the very last brony con ever indeed where we can like like get the gang
01:38:40 back together and all like fuck around and be like stupid idiots and laugh at you know everyone
01:38:45 it's such a beauty it's such a beautiful idea it is it really is i love it so much i i i am not
01:38:51 committed but i'm very much like the idea it has to be real i'm hoping i i've i've basically 100
01:38:57 percent verbally committed i haven't like bought it i haven't like bought a ticket or anything
01:39:01 already i'm committed to make it so just what a shocker mage call me come i can't make it during
01:39:08 the summer that's like a known fact it's just just it's because you're with your grandma right like
01:39:15 90 percent of the year is gonna get a ticket for her but bring grandma no i can't that'll be a
01:39:21 stretch goal for the case we just need to do the house alone european vacation oh that's true
01:39:27 that's what we really need to see to find that guy that you you talked to when you were seven have
01:39:31 them kidnap you bring them i'm bringing you to bring that well we'll just we'll just put just put
01:39:36 her in a big hamster hole she'll be fine i mean that's fine yeah you guys come in and mean the
01:39:43 thingy when are we gonna do pcp hq walley world uh and then we go to las vegas and then we do the
01:39:50 european vacation yeah yeah europe you're a pc that's good that's good more like europe pc
01:40:00 shit anyway if i can the brony con radcon idea is really cool um but the reason i i've been
01:40:10 like not so sure about it before yeah was because not so many people were interested
01:40:15 it seemed like digi was completely hardline against it digi was hardline against it i'm
01:40:19 very enthusiastic that that he's maybe stone has warmed somewhat warm yeah because now now he lives
01:40:25 in virginia beach again which is is not so far away just to throw out the facts there i i bet it
01:40:31 would be possible now that he's thrown that out there perhaps the radcon could in fact be centered
01:40:36 at digi's place or uh or or you know we can all be upset well okay you know what never mind all
01:40:42 right fair enough fair enough so we could have the radcon digi's place right you know have a
01:40:48 good old time there and then go to brony con and then you know get brony drunk sing brony songs
01:40:54 and dance in the street uh do you know we'll do we'll do that all day and then you know uh it
01:41:04 will be drink incredibly epic drink some hard cider you know i mean definitely if we go to
01:41:09 brony con this time i'm going to get drunk because the last time i didn't i didn't get drunk it's
01:41:13 overrated it's not even fun i hate getting drunk it's shit i know but i felt i felt bad that i wasn't
01:41:18 drunk enough plus all the time i was i was drunk enough to feel like silly but i wasn't drunk enough
01:41:24 to do anything silly so i felt like you know when we went up on stage yep and and i was just sort of
01:41:29 like standing there i was like oh jeez i don't know what i'm doing and every and you made and
01:41:34 screaming i was screaming i heard my voice uh that was fun and digi of course uh i don't know
01:41:40 whether we're gonna be able to get any like panel stuff but it'll it'll be nice to see i think much
01:41:45 he said we already got shot down didn't we oh really we didn't get shot down we just didn't
01:41:49 get a response yeah they just they just stop disgusting yeah i mean it feels like time's
01:41:54 really moving along here towards brony con so i mean i don't know how we have we have a few months
01:41:58 left so we'll see i mean we'll see man if we're gonna kickstart radcon four we'd have to we'd have
01:42:04 to get on a ball with that pretty soon yeah yeah well these are all hypotheticals right now technically
01:42:09 i suppose i mean i don't really know what we have left to figure out press a hoof press press hoof
01:42:14 in chat if you like the idea if you want i mean i can't uh munchie and others will be there so no
01:42:20 matter what if you're i mean if you want to go or whatever like munchie at the very least will be
01:42:24 there a hundred percent and me i'm going all right i will be there as well there you go that's at
01:42:28 least three a hundred percent will be there so that'll be there forever there you go i'm gonna
01:42:32 say decide to go on that cruise instead and go sink into the ocean we couldn't blame you should
01:42:39 sail that you should take control of the ship and like sail it into the harbor and just crash it into
01:42:43 the surprise the surprise appearance by the pony cast yes the pony cast will arrive finally at
01:42:48 their destination all this time oh my god incredible incredible that's pretty good okay can i just i just
01:42:58 i want to see that the pirate does the ship have a name oh my god does it oh no it doesn't
01:43:04 oh no think think about it some some no wonder we've been crashing constantly we didn't we didn't
01:43:09 forget to name the damn thing some to some to think about i just i just want you to crash it into
01:43:14 the convention center just just like oh no it doesn't have a name remember it was it was the ss
01:43:19 friendship friendship of course of course thank god i remember okay i want to see the ss friendship
01:43:26 crash in a demonstrative fireball into the convention center hopefully it's doing
01:43:32 the last brony hopefully canonically it's been repaired after its uh its scuff on uh on the
01:43:38 on the waterfalls of canterlot as made famous in t-map resurrection it's like it yeah yeah yeah
01:43:43 easter egg that's an easter egg yep um it's like it tails gets trolled how they have the justin
01:43:48 beaver concert to get all the trolls together so they can blow it up and kill all the trolls
01:43:52 that's what we're doing with for the last brony con we're getting all the bronies together
01:43:56 so we can so we can round last turn so we yeah yeah you can round the ss friendship and then like
01:44:02 all the wrestlers who are on board charge out with the kayfabe commander at the at the to mop
01:44:09 up the timers the ultimate culmination of every arc from all these years pretty much it's all
01:44:16 leading to this singular moment all the plot threads the rich tapestry all combining to this
01:44:21 one singular event cool then we hopefully we can unlock true final boss of lauren faust who will
01:44:28 you know be there and fight us in hand-to-hand combat and bear my children can you imagine if
01:44:33 lauren faust did go that'd be fucking insane there's no way i mean yeah unlikely but would
01:44:39 be amazing they just like they're just keeping it totally under wraps everyone loses their
01:44:44 shit we fear i'll pray god has abandoned them yeah a relatable feeling well i mean i feel like
01:44:52 it's time to move on the last one should we uh there's actually like there's like there's like
01:44:57 one more thing i wanted to mention quickly yeah before before we wrap up um i just wanted to say
01:45:02 that uh i posted a zoomie game the demo on new grounds last week yeah i saw this the reception
01:45:09 was fucking way better than i was anticipating oh great uh it got front-paged and featured
01:45:14 whoa hey so that is so cool dude oh yeah oh yeah i remember seeing that tweet it was like oh holy
01:45:21 shit you did it yeah like it's the demo tom folk follows me on new grounds now i guess uh so that's
01:45:27 cool so yeah that would it went over really well people seem to be digging it so i will be making
01:45:32 a full game uh working on it right now and nice yeah so that's kind of why i want the uh i want
01:45:39 that fucking connect to do more cutscenes and stuff with like shit it'll be send him it's
01:45:44 shit people you're not using that connect that makes me wonder if um maybe i should go maybe i
01:45:50 should i never considered posting on new grounds but maybe i should go back and like post that
01:45:54 like champion i think you should i think it would do really well it's a good idea it's a good idea
01:45:58 like i posted i posted the game first on itch it has like seven reviews and i thought that was
01:46:03 seven ratings and a couple comments i thought that was pretty good i posted mine's the same it's on itch
01:46:07 it's got like a couple of i posted it on new grounds with no fanfare yeah it's currently has
01:46:13 seven hundred like seven seventy favorites like 450 ratings uh not bad i got like four thousand views
01:46:20 and like it's like front page and featured right now it's like on the games of the month page on the
01:46:24 game thing that is so i saw i saw you said like as someone who was on new grounds a lot as a kid
01:46:29 it was really meaningful and i'm like i guess so yeah i would kill the same way maybe i could
01:46:35 do you think uh snakes run away from snakes yes absolutely like some of the games on there are
01:46:41 like not great so like you guys are already way above the bar like because like people dump like
01:46:45 you know my first game and stuff on there which i guess is essentially what i did as well but
01:46:48 like speak speaking of like a weird experience i forgot that i totally forgot this i never
01:46:52 mentioned this on the show uh do you remember idealia uh he watched the show he did uh that name
01:46:58 is very familiar he he submitted a game him and his friends did like like last year um to us and
01:47:04 we were talking about it on one of the episodes oh was it was it that one that's basically um what's
01:47:10 that playing game yeah five lambir it's like some weird name but i i know but you're correct you're
01:47:16 thinking of the right person right yeah i keep talking i talk i keep in touch with him because
01:47:19 like i knew him back from the pony days and everything so we've gone back for a while now
01:47:23 and uh he's doing like programming stuff in school and he's also doing like tutoring for
01:47:27 kids on how to make games and he just messaged me out of the blue one time he's like oh um
01:47:32 your your game's on itch and i'm teaching a bunch of kids like how to make games and stuff
01:47:37 and uh during their breaks they just go on itch and find games and somebody one of these kids
01:47:42 found your game without me telling them it existed and they loved it and when i told them
01:47:47 you use the same software we're using it blew his mind he showed me a video of this kid playing
01:47:51 my game and was like the coolest name of all time whoa that's great what a great experience
01:47:57 so this is amazing so fucking sick yeah yeah yeah yeah um well
01:48:05 fuck awesome last last high note to go out on how can people send you that connect thing
01:48:10 if you if they want it how should they reach you uh just just DM me on twitter we can figure it out
01:48:14 was that at tom oliver uh tommy oliver says yeah tommy oliver says okay tommy oliver says
01:48:19 okay sick all right now they know well all right i sick i guess let's go to voicemails and gib do you

01:48:30 cloud i don't give a shit uh no it's just that i might be a little slow because i'm not used to it
01:48:36 oh yeah there's a there's a there's a rhythm to get into yeah if the if the voicemails are of
01:48:40 higher or lower quality today it's because gib went through them instead of nate so let us know in
01:48:45 the comments who's the better who's the better voicemail meister i'm fascinated to find out
01:48:52 all right uh so this first one is
01:48:56 is application for joining the tcp teen cp all right go dude i i want to fucking join the teen cp
01:49:06 the tcp i want to be i'm a teenager and i'm autistic and gay and also i'm the one who has been on the
01:49:15 bunch of voicemails but you don't know because i use like a fucking retarded name every time like
01:49:19 you know just like do the piano shit like that's good that's some good funk you could be there this
01:49:34 is the minstrel of the teen cp i think found the bard please let me be on the teen cp please
01:49:42 fucking god damn it they want new blood dog contact them this is this is like the platonic
01:49:49 ideal of a of a pcp voicemail yeah begging for attention and inclusion it's a little boy a
01:49:59 little boy begging for attention playing a piano actually that was been pretty good that was some
01:50:03 pretty good piano don't you just love how life imitates art like my little pony cutie marcusators
01:50:08 pcp teen cp it's clockwork it's like it's like it rhymes that's right i if this is the guy that
01:50:16 did all those other like funny piano things then they'd they'd have a pretty powerful member if
01:50:21 it's true teen cp i just i wish i knew how to contact the teen cp a munchie or munchie is not
01:50:27 here right now but uh i don't know i guess keep an eye out what an unfortunate name the teen cp
01:50:33 oh no you're right i just realized what yeah rock bro gulp okay uh next one i guess now i get it
01:50:45 that's really funny we better distance ourselves from that we better go off twitter for a while
01:50:53 okay this next one is uh bonus episodes what happens follow up question okay go okay i have
01:51:00 another follow up question till last week i was going to ask about what happens when you buy the
01:51:05 patreon like the bonus episodes and you told me those youtube links and that's very good i like that
01:51:10 but um can i just pay once because like you know i pay for it and it's five dollars and then i get
01:51:15 the links to all the videos presumably and then could i just immediately sign off like once i give
01:51:21 you five dollars i never have to pay you again or do i have to keep paying to keep you having the
01:51:26 episodes because uh i'd like to only spend five dollars and i'll give you a bunch of money
01:51:35 but now i don't know relax i feel like good money situation so could i do that right i feel like
01:51:41 this is like you don't boring question boring answer you just don't tell people you're doing
01:51:47 that what the fuck the the answer is you subs you you you pledge once and you will automatically
01:51:53 it'll automatically it's a subscription service you will have you will then have access to all of
01:51:57 the previous ones yep if you unsub then you will no longer be subbed and you won't get access to
01:52:04 the new ones the thing is i indeed i think what he's asking is like can you hold on to the links
01:52:11 i mean uh for later well this our big problem right now from what i understand is that we
01:52:15 have them in a playlist so if you have the playlist link you can just unsub and keep using the playlist
01:52:19 don't say the unspoken rules stop no here's here's here's the thing though i mean yeah absolutely
01:52:27 the the thing with it is like um every month uh it becomes a better deal because you're getting
01:52:32 more more stuff yeah absolutely five dollars absolutely and if you spend five dollars to
01:52:37 listen to a bunch of bonus episodes every month there will be a new one so if you unsub if you
01:52:43 aren't pledge you'll have to re pledge again if you want to listen to the new one i mean what we
01:52:46 should do is we just shouldn't we should put we shouldn't put the new episode in the playlist
01:52:50 until the next month well you can never get the new one you like the new one i i have long suspected
01:52:57 there's there's a few people that when the when the new episodes come out i see people come out
01:53:01 the word and say nay why won't you add it to the playlist and i'm like why do these guys
01:53:05 want in the playlist so bad hmm big think i'm pulling a big think right now well here's here's
01:53:12 a okay here's a thought then again the people saying that are in the bonus lounge which you
01:53:16 can only get into if you're currently pledging so maybe i'm just crazy could we maybe could we maybe
01:53:22 like refresh the url or something for the playlist every month hmm uh you know i don't know if it
01:53:29 works that way but make a new playlist every month you could you could make a new playlist
01:53:33 theoretically i suppose i mean yeah i know sure but yikes i mean yeah yeah that's uh i mean what
01:53:42 yeah there's really no way to do it because like i was i was gonna say we could use like a bitly
01:53:46 link and kill it and change it every month but like it the as long as you get the you can get the
01:53:50 link yeah yeah you would still refer to the the main the playlist really is the achilles heel of
01:53:55 this entire business model like we have to get kind of but you know it's so convenient for people
01:54:00 and i hate to take away that kind of convenience i i just hope that people i mean this is really
01:54:04 people are pledging for to support the show i i think so hopefully most people yeah i mean there
01:54:09 is a bit of an honor system involved but like yeah in addition to getting the bonus and you know
01:54:13 what and the reason i've never been too concerned is because i do just pay a general attention to
01:54:18 the total views of each bonus episode and frankly they're lower than like our number of patron of
01:54:24 of like bonus episode patrons so i'm like all right like this isn't getting out of control this
01:54:28 seems pretty pretty in hand if there was like thousands of views i'd be like well okay this is
01:54:32 it's nice that people are interested but this is spreading a bit beyond you know what i would
01:54:36 like it to be um i mean it might not be a terrible idea to once in a while you know maybe maybe
01:54:43 refresh the playlist or if you can't do that just sort of copy it and make a new one and have a new
01:54:47 link just so like maybe someone who paid five dollars like or if you just if you just have a
01:54:52 years ago isn't like you know still just co i mean i know people are gonna get the link if they're
01:54:56 dedicated and they want it and that's fine and i don't really blame him for it yeah i mean another
01:55:01 option is to have like a master post man patreon so the playlist is there if you're not a patron you
01:55:05 can't click it in that's not boring look if you have the opportunity if you have the opportunity to
01:55:10 steal something and get away with it do it take it i don't care anti business i don't care if i'm
01:55:15 shooting ourselves in the foot always steal always pirate always steal end of story i say i
01:55:22 understand closing my rules are different when it's my wallet being affected jesse yeah that's
01:55:26 the difference like i said i don't i don't blame anyone for uh for for doing that i really think
01:55:32 most people do it out of good will they want to support i i think so too but you know we shouldn't
01:55:36 make it like so we shouldn't make it like so easy right we wanted to be inviting it right all right
01:55:41 i i couldn't agree more i couldn't agree more and you know you know just of interest sam harris um
01:55:47 for his for his like membership program or whatever for like his podcast he does like extra stuff
01:55:51 beyond the scenes like it um uh oh no he has like an app or whatever that costs a little money the
01:55:56 interesting thing about him i might have talked about this before but it's just that like he
01:55:59 says straight up like yo here's the deal the app costs like five dollars like i think like forever
01:56:05 or something or like ten bucks forever or no i think it is monthly whatever but he says like
01:56:08 okay just so you know anyone who wants this app all you need to do email this email address and
01:56:14 just say hey i can't afford this right now we will give you like the month for we will just give you
01:56:20 whoever you are message us on this email you get it for free the thing is though you have to also
01:56:26 message us next month for it to say that i still can't afford please give it to me so there's a
01:56:30 little bit of work involved in doing this it's not a get out of jail completely free but if you're
01:56:35 if you're poor couldn't there's nothing easier than just sending an email so you that really seems
01:56:40 like a smart business model to me you're giving people what they need but that seems like a small
01:56:44 business model except for the work involved in like going through well the thing is he's got a team
01:56:50 so for him it makes sense but for us yeah yeah yeah we're a little bit too small of an operation
01:56:55 for that i'd say um well okay that was a that was a juicy one yeah let's go on right this next one
01:57:02 is i think uh by the the the grandmaster of the teen cp the first guy who who came up with the term
01:57:09 now this is a play he's getting more popular than the we have to destroy the cannibalizing our
01:57:14 audience uh it says apply to the teen cp or i'll have to fuck you in the ass uh go auditions are open
01:57:21 for the remaining slots of the teen cp and i wanted to get the message across the teen cp
01:57:27 it's better than any other shit so i thought that i'd say it in the only language on the
01:57:31 hands of thoughts can understand flames of fucking hell in a rap form oh my god i may be
01:57:38 former baby that's the more than all the good vids you may combine there's that shame lately i
01:57:43 haven't been laughing at any of this shit i blame all you boomers but munchy all the rest of you
01:57:48 fools are they punchy political discussion is rehashing oh shit y'all is basically like a
01:57:53 risk got on a scrunchie honey yeah i'm trying to line up try to zoom me because tom's the only one
01:57:58 that could speak just as much for me sorry tom that you've peaked now it's time for some more times
01:58:06 okay hey hippo you wanted a rap that's a bit hypocritical come with this movie boy crap sure
01:58:13 stop animating but why are you hating your hypocritical needs some more money simulating
01:58:16 this flaps chaps me and my fuck off nature debates are assless so an anime sort up your ass
01:58:23 and ass and not an abuser will come out for years you really fucking are retarded for no one could
01:58:27 hear she may be a major because i think i've been cursed all these stage curse words come
01:58:34 meaning this burst but i'm almost feeling bad going in on her but we're still my 90 seconds
01:58:39 and it's almost up oh well that's all the time i have here but you fuck boys try and come at me
01:58:45 and you better get ready for the squeakle apply to the tnc peter
01:58:52 i wish i could have understood what he said he didn't do me i think he didn't have time just
01:58:58 didn't have time he's gonna leave he's leaving me for the squeakle that was like a that was like
01:59:02 an early justin beaver video i think the idea of this track that was really cute i just i really
01:59:10 wish i could understand i yeah our boys need a little bit better mark i got a lot of it yeah i
01:59:16 got most of it i got most of it i think i just said hippo does this man have a name well i'm just
01:59:21 saying does this man know what his name is yeah he has his name i was ten cp your name is teen cp as
01:59:26 far as i'm concerned you're the embodiment that's you mr. teen cp that's you uh well sick uh i'm pretty
01:59:36 pretty happy uh can't can't wait for the squeakle i don't feel thoroughly devastated enough i need
01:59:42 more i say he's cannibalizing our audience and he's roasting us at the same time maybe this is the
01:59:47 true rivalry we've waited for all along what cheek what cheek i say all right all right as next one
01:59:56 is hater man oh go hello my name is hater man i just made up this persona because fuck you i hate
02:00:03 everyone and everything myself included the number one thing i hate about your podcast is that you
02:00:08 don't let nate and ben because who else would be having this stupid argument come to a conclusion
02:00:13 in their debates i understand the other members are discomforted by this but not letting the
02:00:19 argument have a conclusion is at best a waste of time between two episodes of this podcast there's
02:00:25 been no real conclusion or compromise on the pewdiepie debate the whole thing should have just been
02:00:30 cut if there was never going to be a conclusion it would be better to finish the debate at the end
02:00:35 of the podcast after the voicemails where the other members could leave if they so choose to
02:00:40 then to have a half finished debate where the other members are like ha ha that's stupid this guy's
02:00:45 stupid get him out of here no this guy this guy's exactly no okay okay here here you go dumbass
02:00:50 you can't you can't conclude such a debate you'll never end you guys will never yield to you
02:00:57 yeah yeah ben and nate will not yield there will be no conclusion ben and nate are batman
02:01:01 and the joker they are destined to do this forever yeah that's true that's true that is on point yeah
02:01:07 this is why we need you know we need two best brothers bitch about politics like that's the only
02:01:11 place we do we do i i want to do that's that's that's a very good i like i think that would
02:01:16 actually be successful maybe outside of us i'm pretty sure this is the same guy who commented
02:01:20 like the exact same thing on on the episode i agree i think i think it would actually be
02:01:26 successful i literally would be fine with going and like posting it on the old uh uh t now okay
02:01:32 i'm just converting it i'm i'm i am somewhat i don't know if i really want to do it but but uh uh uh
02:01:38 like the idea of sullying the the it's a it's a retired deceased channel the idea of taking
02:01:46 it into a politics channel makes me want to fucking puke it makes me want to make a new channel
02:01:52 branded as t bat politics fine we would okay we wouldn't have to put it on the old channel but why
02:01:57 the fuck not this is what we need to do you guys need to do just as a bonus episode you need we need
02:02:02 to do it as a bonus episode like a 15 hour debate where you guys just go until you're too exhausted
02:02:07 that's how every episode will be and if people like it make a channel yeah make a channel for it
02:02:12 have been draw like people instead of ponies this time and just like instead of doing it instead of
02:02:17 doing it weekly just do it whenever there's a big debate to have like in the news or something
02:02:22 literally literally would love would would love to would love every time every time a political
02:02:27 debate pops up in an episode we cut it and then you guys redo it on that show okay just keep going
02:02:33 forever i just agree with this notion that like yeah debates should or can just be like resolved
02:02:41 like sometimes it's not really a debate we're having a conversation just have it be natural and
02:02:46 it can get it can peter out and it can come back in the next episode i mean that's like the reason
02:02:51 we dropped the pewdiepie thing last week was because we weren't getting a lot yeah it was no
02:02:56 these are complex there was no agreement these are complex issues so if you just like pretend to
02:03:01 have reached a conclusion it's gonna be false and i mean i really think like okay either one
02:03:07 or two things will happen one we go like really research data and we're able to like disprove or
02:03:11 make a really strong case that the other person is wrong but barring that i really think basically
02:03:16 every political debate if it's not about the facts just boils down to the like the the core values
02:03:23 of the person because it will be attracted the the idea that debates need to be resolved or need
02:03:28 to have a winner is a cancer on all of society they're supposed to be an exchange of ideas not
02:03:33 necessarily a battle of wills the winner is the fact that it happened it would be nice if we could
02:03:38 come to agreements but like i don't know i mean do people really think that that's how it works
02:03:44 like i don't know that doesn't tend that doesn't tend to happen i don't i don't recall ever watching
02:03:48 a debate with a conclusion like that you know i mean don't they only say the debate is for jordan
02:03:53 peterson and sam harris like those discussions like never they never like come to yeah they all
02:03:58 they always end with people talking about things actually isn't it the point of uh a debate like
02:04:03 an official debate to just present your opinions to argue a little and then at the end let the
02:04:07 audience decide who was right yeah exactly i think most of the time yeah that's yeah like every
02:04:13 like no one's ever swayed in a debate like no one changes their mind at the every debate ends with
02:04:18 well you made some points and i made some points and we can agree to disagree because we're all sick
02:04:22 of arguing the end i mean that's how every debate in history is supposed to end maybe that's what
02:04:26 hater man is really craving he wants that moment of like we're like we've reached the end we cannot
02:04:30 go any further let's shake hands and say he's just another lost soul looking for an objective
02:04:35 truth in the universe that he will never find because it will never exist yeah maybe and i
02:04:39 sympathize as do i as do i i mean i got nothing else to say on this yeah we'll let you know if
02:04:45 we have any political little shows going or something um we i don't i don't know what we
02:04:52 would do it about specifically yeah but i want to do it maybe you know i mean we could we could
02:04:57 probably try it sometime we could you know we could argue about like where did where it should go
02:05:01 what to do i mean maybe hosting it just a separate video on the bcp that'd be the first debate like
02:05:04 where where will the shit go on the music what about this what about this com i mean what if we
02:05:09 put out like a promo on tbap for the new tbap the new the new bad tbap yeah okay i suppose perhaps
02:05:18 something like that i could concede on i suppose as long as it doesn't okay i just don't want to like
02:05:22 you know flood what i consider a nice old channel not everybody was on it but i like it to be
02:05:28 resting in peace yeah i feel you the well okay i just just just for intellectual curiosity
02:05:35 here's my case okay why i wouldn't mind i mean one the people like the people already subbed
02:05:41 to tbap they subbed you know because it was a show in which you and i talked about stuff about
02:05:47 ponies though so who knows how much is specifically that though yeah yeah that's there's that but like
02:05:52 you know there's both yeah okay i got you and two like the fact that the acronym is the same
02:05:58 would just it's funny like it's still tbap it's still tbap even though it's completely different
02:06:04 i hear you on that you know i argue it's purely sentimental it's purely you'd have to you'd have
02:06:08 to like trick people into getting invested you'd have to like phrase like frame the debate as like
02:06:13 something pony related like celestia versus luna politics and then slowly as the argument goes on
02:06:19 you drop the facade and then that's it wouldn't it wouldn't be worth doing if we had to do that
02:06:24 this is no i don't this is not i'm not saying that would be the whole thing just in the beginning
02:06:28 to get people to click on it but like 20 minutes into the video with hard pivots and then everyone's
02:06:32 trapped because they're invested no see see no i want to draw in this is for a new i don't want
02:06:37 i don't want the old the pony audience then why would you post on the old channel like you're
02:06:40 there's no benefit there's there's a there's a small but it's more than zero i suppose you know
02:06:45 so yeah anything under than a thousand doesn't matter in youtube numbers uh tbap's got like 15
02:06:51 thousand yeah at like 16 i don't i don't think you get even a thousand people interested in
02:06:54 political discussion off of a dead oh that's possible that's possible yeah okay well whatever
02:07:00 we'll get back to you people let's let's let's go to this is i'm yeah okay all right this next one
02:07:06 is a cluster punk kitchen oh hooray oh hell yeah everyone's favorite show oh munchie's gonna munch
02:07:11 he's missing it oh well that's what he gets and go pound of beef in the pan yes what's fed from the
02:07:18 ground stir it round stir it brown spaghetti sauce without the noodles liquid all the way

02:08:25 oh my god oh my god take a bite change your life
02:08:31 wow wow the production values i ain't voice grail confirmed i think yeah we got it you're
02:08:38 welcome to the voice grail cluster punk kitchen you you've got i learned my lesson
02:08:41 yeah how dare you do my one week
02:08:53 it converts it converts ketones in your body to plasma and then they come exploding out of your
02:08:58 pores the heat of the surface of the sun yeah it's very effective you know you know i got a
02:09:05 couple of my clients on on on twitter a couple people were messaging me asking me uh like hey
02:09:10 nate um can you tell us like how to get like edited audio into speak pipe and like somebody
02:09:16 replied to it saying that there's like a setting that you can set on windows or something that
02:09:20 allows like your your general audio that's being played to like be received as input audio or
02:09:25 something so like if somebody could clarify that i guess in general i think some people are looking
02:09:29 for that information if we could like directly through soundcloud no no no it's like uh like
02:09:35 there's something you can do on your computer setting so that when you go to uh speak pipe
02:09:40 and you hit record like all audio like happening like if you're playing like something on youtube
02:09:44 and like your microphone it'll all get funneled like into the speak pipe like input well well like
02:09:51 okay i mean like for me to i look i would open up obs and i would just set it to like you know
02:09:56 register desktop audio and then i would just start recording and play the audio files that i
02:10:03 i mean for obs that's fine but speak pipe doesn't have that kind of like a setting on it so it's
02:10:07 like a more primitive sort of thing so you need to like change your desktop audio to a mic input
02:10:11 it's it's weird i don't know exactly how to do it but like it is doable clearly yeah so people have
02:10:16 been doing it for a while look at if we get i'd love to give people some information on that so
02:10:19 if anybody has that i don't know put it put it down below in the description if you've got like
02:10:22 steps or something so that people can see that we'll pin that or maybe maybe oblivion fall
02:10:26 knows maybe oblivion fall maybe oblivion fall knows all right what you need is a program called
02:10:34 voicemeter and vb audio cables what voicemeter does is it stands between your microphone and
02:10:43 all of the programs on your computer acting as a middleman and it lets you shift your audio inputs
02:10:49 and outputs around basically you can shuffle them however you like the version i use is the default
02:10:56 simple one and basically you have three main channels you use one for your microphone one for
02:11:03 your desktop audio and one for communications if you want to know how to set this up and how to do
02:11:09 it right check the show notes for this timestamp just look at where you're at i will be linking
02:11:15 download links to both voicemeter vb audio cables and a proper tutorial explaining how to install
02:11:21 how it works if you do this not only will you be able to pre-record your voicemails but you
02:11:26 can also basically have an infinite soundboard at your fingertips when using discord or skype
02:11:31 if you have a folder full of sound effects you just press a button boop they can hear your audio
02:11:36 boop but that's enough from me uh back to your regularly scheduled uh pppness time maybe oblivion
02:11:44 fall knows he probably does that guy knows everything haha we pay him enough to know all
02:11:50 the answers god damn it indeed we do by the way you know what i i've been feeling bad about this
02:11:54 i've been meaning to like do a tweet on the pcp like saying like hey guys just want to let everybody
02:11:59 know congratulations to our new editor oblivion like i didn't do it for the sake of the mystery but
02:12:03 now it's been like two weeks beyond that uh so i really got to do that i like i feel like he's
02:12:07 for all those people who follow the twitter but don't listen to the show uh i'm sure that yeah
02:12:12 for them you know what that's for some reason i feel like real like the twitter is like the
02:12:17 place where real announcements are made like big life changing but we get way more listeners on
02:12:22 the show than people on the twitter so so i don't know okay anyway anyway uh all right let's let's
02:12:29 move on what you got uh next one is critical mistake about hyenas sick go this is the most
02:12:38 embarrassing thing i've ever seen in my life i see the title the episode trans hyenas i know where it's
02:12:46 going we're going to talk about the best part of female hyena the coolest thing nature's ever invented
02:12:51 the pseudo penis but no we didn't get it we didn't get it so i just need to tell you you idiots you're
02:13:01 talking about like these big hulking female hyenas it gets crazier than that they have in large clitoris
02:13:09 that are so big that they literally are called pseudo penises by science this isn't a word i made
02:13:15 up unfortunately but they use that to literally subjugate the males as you would just i actually
02:13:24 knew that if that means why would you call it trans hyena is not mentioned the best part about
02:13:27 them actually being trans um fascinating we're bring it we brought it back to pegging we started
02:13:34 oh yeah we can just end the show right here it all so they literally fuck the males into submission
02:13:40 is this the gist of what's happened i think they do have the ability to sort of like make the
02:13:47 correctly oh yeah sure i mean a click can that be on ben sains tombstone it started with pegging
02:13:54 and it ended with pegging new shirt new shirt new shirt i don't know is it sure with a picture
02:14:06 of a tombstone on it with that inscription if it's ben sains tombstone with these words written on it
02:14:11 oh it's a great idea uh okay why not thanks for the info i want the words put this on a shirt on
02:14:20 my tombstone oh that's good yeah that's good and i want the words put this on a tombstone on a shirt
02:14:27 oh yeah what about what about a shirt that is a tombstone that says put this on a shirt um put
