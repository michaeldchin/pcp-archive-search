00:00:00 Come on, you fuckers think that just cause a guy reads comics, he can't start some shit?
00:00:04 Aw, fucking take all you want!
00:00:06 Leviathan, you ready?
00:00:08 Home again, home again.
00:00:10 Gibbontake the love!
00:00:11 Class is paying 101.
00:00:15 I guess one person can make a difference.
00:00:19 Yeah!
00:00:24 I'm starting it out dick style this week.
00:00:26 Welcome everybody to the panel cast.
00:00:29 We are back after a long hiatus.
00:00:31 There was no panel cast last week.
00:00:33 Everyone was fucking furious at me.
00:00:35 I got all your tweets, all one of them, from all my fan.
00:00:38 He was so angry with me that there wasn't a panel cast.
00:00:41 I was like, you know, it was such a busy week.
00:00:44 I had to finish my big election video.
00:00:46 And then I was busy with other stuff.
00:00:48 You know, I was busy being a well-laid lefario.
00:00:52 Traveling the country on my love quest.
00:00:55 But I'm back.
00:00:57 The election week is finally over.
00:00:59 The election's over people.
00:01:01 And I really think that America needs this.
00:01:03 You need the panel cast right now.
00:01:05 This country needs to be united in the panel cast more than ever.
00:01:08 You all need to come with me on the SS panel cast.
00:01:11 My pirate ship and sail through the cosmos
00:01:15 into my dimension of comic book panels
00:01:17 and become wire frame res people with me.
00:01:21 And I'm back.
00:01:23 Oh my god, the election's finally over.
00:01:25 I think it's the election that won't die is what it is.
00:01:29 It's still going on.
00:01:30 It's still all over.
00:01:32 It should be over by now.
00:01:33 But these fucking people, these god,
00:01:35 I'm gonna say it, these god damned millennials
00:01:38 who won't shut the fuck up.
00:01:40 It's over.
00:01:41 Stop fucking whining.
00:01:43 You fucking brainwashed idiotic.
00:01:45 It's, you know, all these cowardly females
00:01:48 who are so convinced that Donald Trump,
00:01:50 you know, now that he's president
00:01:52 that they're gonna walk outside,
00:01:54 the whole world's gonna be on fire.
00:01:56 And there's gonna be like rape drones
00:01:58 swooping down from the sky to grab everyone's pussy.
00:02:01 I know I already said this stuff.
00:02:03 I know, I have, oh god, I can't, I hate them all so much.
00:02:07 I had a fucking existential crisis the other night
00:02:10 because I went to a friend's house on election night
00:02:13 and saw my friends like crying,
00:02:16 like putting their hands in their faces and weeping
00:02:18 because Donald Trump won,
00:02:20 because they're so fucking brainwashed by the media,
00:02:22 they'll legitimately think that now
00:02:24 they're gonna like lose all their rights to vote
00:02:26 and their right to have an abortion
00:02:28 and the whole country is just gonna become
00:02:30 the United States of Rape.
00:02:32 That's how fucking retarded people are.
00:02:34 But enough about the election.
00:02:35 For god's sakes, enough about the election.
00:02:37 I know that I'm being part of the fucking problem right now.
00:02:39 God, I just want it to die.
00:02:41 It should be dead.
00:02:42 It's over.
00:02:43 It's been like three days.
00:02:44 It's Thursday now and they won't shut up about it.
00:02:46 They won't let it die.
00:02:47 The election that won't die
00:02:48 is continuing to lurch along like a fucking zombie.
00:02:51 And I just want to bash its fucking brains in.
00:02:54 I want to take everyone who cared about the election,
00:02:57 all of these whiny millennials
00:02:59 and delusional females on Facebook and Twitter
00:03:02 who won't stop fucking crying about Donald Trump,
00:03:05 even though it's fucking over and done with.
00:03:07 I want to take them all.
00:03:08 I want to take all the fucking voters
00:03:10 and I want to line them up on their knees
00:03:12 so fucking Negan can bash their fucking heads in
00:03:15 and just, I want them all, I want all voters to die.
00:03:18 I want to run someday on the presidential platform
00:03:22 of kill all voters and I'll be the last president
00:03:25 that this country ever fucking has
00:03:27 because once I'm elected, you're all fucking dead.
00:03:30 Everyone who voted for me is dead.
00:03:32 Everyone who voted for the other guy is dead.
00:03:35 I'm just going to become God Emperor forever,
00:03:38 outlaw democracy and just give everyone free comics.
00:03:41 That'll be my tax plan.
00:03:43 Instead of paying taxes, you all get comics every year.
00:03:47 Holy shit, I'm so mad.
00:03:49 Anyways, welcome to the panel cast, everybody.
00:03:53 We're going to talk about some fucking comics this week
00:03:56 and I have a special guest this week.
00:03:59 This is a two-person panel cast.
00:04:02 I have with me, I forgot to give her a name.
00:04:05 I like to give my friends names.
00:04:08 I like to protect people's identities.
00:04:10 That's why secretary is secretary.
00:04:12 I didn't give you a...
00:04:13 This is the amazing Alice, everybody.
00:04:15 Hi, that was a marvel just now, witnessing all that.
00:04:20 Oh yeah, she had to sit next to that.
00:04:24 I hope they can hear you.
00:04:26 I hope this microphone can pick up both of us.
00:04:28 Oh yeah, no.
00:04:29 You're kind of sitting in like a lawn chair
00:04:31 and you're sinking into the floor
00:04:33 so you're not totally close to the microphone.
00:04:35 It's my fault.
00:04:36 No, it seems fine.
00:04:37 But anyways, this is my loyal scribe.
00:04:41 She's been staying with me for the week,
00:04:43 all the funny things I say and posting them on Twitter for me.
00:04:46 And she's a comic book girl.
00:04:49 She owns...
00:04:51 You tell them what you do.
00:04:54 I help run a comic book shop company.
00:04:57 That's about the gist of it.
00:05:00 Aren't you in charge of like four stores or something?
00:05:02 I help out at four stores, basically.
00:05:04 She was flipping out like earlier.
00:05:06 She wanted to do this panel cast so bad.
00:05:08 She was bothering me.
00:05:09 I was trying to listen to all of my podcasts for the week
00:05:12 and get my stuff done.
00:05:13 I was trying to watch my stories, watch my shows.
00:05:15 I was listening to The Dick Show.
00:05:16 I was trying to listen to Digi's Decompression Chamber
00:05:18 and she's over there fucking whining.
00:05:20 I didn't do the panel cast.
00:05:22 I love comics and I want to tell the world
00:05:24 that I know about comics and I want to show the world
00:05:26 that girls can love comics too
00:05:28 because girls aren't going to be allowed to read comics anymore
00:05:31 and that Trump is president.
00:05:33 I want to show the world that women have rights
00:05:37 to read comics.
00:05:38 And she was just pestering me.
00:05:40 I'm trying to listen to all of my stuff
00:05:42 and then I'm like, okay, I'm ready now.
00:05:44 Let's do the panel cast
00:05:45 and then immediately she's fucking over there on her laptop
00:05:48 doing some work shit, yelling at her employees,
00:05:51 throwing a fucking fit
00:05:53 and I had to fucking sit there.
00:05:54 Once I got ready to record this,
00:05:57 then I had to sit there and fucking twiddle my dick
00:05:59 while she went off
00:06:01 and yelled at her boss on the phone for like an hour
00:06:05 and then she comes back all huffing and steaming like,
00:06:08 oh god, and I'm just like, okay.
00:06:10 And so that was another hour.
00:06:12 What do you have to say for yourself?
00:06:14 I'm a nuisance.
00:06:15 That's about the chist of it.
00:06:17 She is a nuisance, like all women.
00:06:19 You know, thank god that Trump's president
00:06:21 is going to bring back the ancient technique
00:06:24 of putting five across the face
00:06:26 on a hysterical woman to calm her down.
00:06:28 That's the first order of business.
00:06:30 That was trending, I think, Trump's first order, hashtag
00:06:32 Trump's first order.
00:06:33 That's what I think it's going to be.
00:06:35 Trump's first order is to bring back
00:06:36 slapping hysterical women to make them act right.
00:06:39 You know, I had a dream like that once about rape drones.
00:06:42 It was a good dream. I liked it.
00:06:45 Were they just like a helicoptering on with little dildos
00:06:47 hanging off the bottom of them?
00:06:50 Beware the ghost of Boo Radley.
00:06:52 He is a rapist, possibly.
00:06:55 Vanguard One is not.
00:06:56 Vanguard One is a noble, a feminist, a male feminist,
00:07:01 but a good kind, not like a beta male.
00:07:04 Boo Radley, though, is his evil alter ego.
00:07:06 Jesus Christ, what am I talking about?
00:07:08 Anyways, so much fucking to talk about
00:07:11 on the panel cast this week because I missed a week.
00:07:14 I should explain why there was no panel cast last week,
00:07:17 partly because I was busy making that big election video.
00:07:21 But also, I did start recording the panel cast.
00:07:24 I recorded the intro for it.
00:07:25 It was this big 20-minute rant of an intro.
00:07:28 It was really funny.
00:07:29 You'll probably hear it next week.
00:07:31 I'll stick it on that one.
00:07:32 I recorded the intro for the panel cast,
00:07:34 and then when I started to get into the meat
00:07:36 of talking about the comics,
00:07:37 what happened was the comics last week were all so terrible
00:07:41 that it broke me, and I couldn't even muster any words for them.
00:07:45 I was so seething mad about these fucking comics that I read,
00:07:49 specifically one.
00:07:50 I'll just fucking say it.
00:07:52 There's this comic out right now called Champions,
00:07:55 and I read the fucking, you know what I'm talking about?
00:07:58 Oh, yeah.
00:07:59 By Mark Wade, right?
00:08:01 The same guy who turned Daredevil into like a San Franciscan hipster
00:08:07 fuckboy, sweetboy, manjina for like 10 years.
00:08:12 This comic champions, where do I even start
00:08:15 with how much I fucking hated this?
00:08:16 I have to say it.
00:08:17 Even though it came out last week,
00:08:18 I won't be able to function this week unless I get this off my chest.
00:08:22 It first of all takes place after the Civil War II event,
00:08:25 which is still fucking going on,
00:08:26 because Marvel can't fucking get their shit together
00:08:29 and do anything right.
00:08:30 So every comic that you read now, half the Marvel comics that you buy now
00:08:33 are just going to spoil the story that's going on right now.
00:08:36 Like, I know what happens at the end of Civil War II now
00:08:38 without having it spoiled.
00:08:40 They spoil their own shit because their stories are so bloated
00:08:43 and they take so long to get them out
00:08:45 that they have to release the stories after them
00:08:47 before they're even done.
00:08:48 They even extend them.
00:08:49 They're like, ah, Civil War.
00:08:50 You guys wanted an extra issue of that, didn't you?
00:08:52 Oh, God, it's terrible.
00:08:54 Yeah, so this champion's book, it takes place after the Civil War II
00:08:59 thing that's going on.
00:09:02 So I guess the young heroes, the teeny-bopper Avengers,
00:09:07 they're all so angry at the adult Avengers
00:09:10 for having the Civil War II,
00:09:12 for having this big, boring comic book event,
00:09:15 that they're like, fuck you, we're going to go be actual superheroes.
00:09:19 I feel like I've seen this plot in comics over and over my whole life.
00:09:23 A team of heroes that says the heroes aren't doing it right,
00:09:26 so we're going to get back to basics,
00:09:28 and it's always a lie.
00:09:29 It's always an unfulfilled promise.
00:09:31 The offshoot team of heroes who wants to do it right
00:09:34 and not get wrapped up in events, they do anyways.
00:09:37 I mean, the prophecy repeats itself always.
00:09:39 Yeah, it's a self-fulfilling.
00:09:41 It's like an uraboros of shitty comics
00:09:43 that's perpetually eating its own tail.
00:09:46 Yep.
00:09:48 But so the teeny-bopper Avengers,
00:09:51 they try to start their own little Avengers team
00:09:53 and first of all, this lineup of these teeny-bopper Avengers,
00:09:57 half of them are characters that I fucking hate
00:10:00 and loathe and despise.
00:10:02 And, oh, I'll get to it.
00:10:04 And half of them I hate, and the other half I like,
00:10:06 but were ruined in this comic,
00:10:08 because I read the first two issues.
00:10:10 It's two issues so far.
00:10:11 But, I mean, I'll just go through the lineup.
00:10:13 First of all, Nova.
00:10:15 Who the fuck is Nova?
00:10:17 I don't know and I don't care.
00:10:18 Don't even explain it to me,
00:10:19 because I don't even want to know who he is.
00:10:20 I hate him.
00:10:21 He's just some little sweet boy in a helmet
00:10:23 who fucking flies around with a rocket ass.
00:10:26 You can tell me who he is.
00:10:28 Well, I mean, they're bringing back old Nova,
00:10:30 so it won't matter anyway.
00:10:32 Well, yeah, of course,
00:10:33 because every superhero has to be five superheroes now.
00:10:35 There's got to be ten Captain Americas.
00:10:37 We have to have a Captain America to represent
00:10:39 every minority and sexual orientation on the planet.
00:10:42 Yep.
00:10:44 Like you said, Marvel is Tumblr.
00:10:46 Yeah, Marvel is Tumblr incarnate.
00:10:48 They are not two separate companies.
00:10:49 They are one entity.
00:10:51 Oh, I hate them.
00:10:53 Don't worry about Nova.
00:10:55 He doesn't matter.
00:10:56 Yeah, that's what I assumed.
00:10:58 Nova doesn't matter.
00:10:59 What has Nova ever done?
00:11:00 What even is this character?
00:11:02 Why does he even exist?
00:11:03 He's got a special helmet
00:11:04 that lets him do special things, moving on.
00:11:06 Wow, that's like a Disney Channel original movie.
00:11:08 That's not a superhero origin.
00:11:10 I found a magic pair of sneakers
00:11:12 and now I can jump high.
00:11:14 Wow.
00:11:15 What a bitch.
00:11:16 I hate him.
00:11:17 You know, so much of the cosmic Marvel stuff
00:11:19 I hate anyways.
00:11:20 I can't get into it.
00:11:21 It's so weird, but enough about that.
00:11:22 So there's Nova.
00:11:23 He's fucking nobody.
00:11:24 I don't care about him.
00:11:25 He's not interesting at all.
00:11:26 He has no like, you know, like every good superhero,
00:11:28 a great superhero, Spider-Man, Batman, the Hulk.
00:11:31 There's always something at the core of the character
00:11:33 that everyone in the world can relate to.
00:11:35 Some struggle that defines the character.
00:11:37 And I hate these like second string characters
00:11:39 that just don't have that.
00:11:40 They're just like one dimensional
00:11:42 or not even one dimensional.
00:11:43 They're multi-dimensional
00:11:44 because they serve the purposes
00:11:46 of whatever story they're in
00:11:47 because they don't have a personality
00:11:48 or a backstory that anyone cares about.
00:11:50 And I think Nova's a great example of that.
00:11:52 Fuck them.
00:11:53 If you're a big fan of Nova, you're not.
00:11:55 Yeah, I'm not even,
00:11:56 I don't even know what to say to that.
00:11:57 No one's a big fan of Nova.
00:11:59 So there's that guy that I hate.
00:12:01 Next up is Amadeus Cho,
00:12:03 the fucking, the genius intellect,
00:12:05 teenage fucking Bro Hulk.
00:12:08 The teenage Asian Bro Hulk
00:12:11 who like spends this entire comic
00:12:12 like macking on all the honeys
00:12:14 because I guess the Hulk should be cool now.
00:12:17 Like, I can't imagine,
00:12:20 they do this like all the time.
00:12:22 Jekyll has done this like periodically
00:12:24 every five years since the dawn of Marvel.
00:12:28 They go, hey, what if the Hulk wasn't angry?
00:12:33 Well, then he's not the fucking Hulk.
00:12:35 He's not interesting.
00:12:37 The whole thing that makes the Hulk interesting
00:12:39 is that like basic,
00:12:41 like that iconic Jekyll and Hyde storyline
00:12:45 that everyone can relate to.
00:12:46 Like everybody has like a side of themselves
00:12:48 they don't like.
00:12:49 Everybody, you know, might have a temper
00:12:51 in security and that's what the Hulk speaks to.
00:12:53 That's why he's a great character
00:12:55 because Bruce Banner will never
00:12:57 and should never be able to control the Hulk
00:12:59 or contain him.
00:13:00 And every fucking five years,
00:13:02 Marvel gets on this kick where they're like,
00:13:04 maybe like, you know, Dr. Banner,
00:13:06 the Hulk is a genius now or Grey Hulk.
00:13:08 He fucking works in a casino now
00:13:10 and he beats people up with a crowbar.
00:13:12 He's like a bouncer or some shit
00:13:14 or there's a Red Hulk now.
00:13:16 Thunderbolt Ross is a Hulk
00:13:17 and Betty's a Hulk too.
00:13:18 Everyone's a fucking Hulk now.
00:13:20 And now his little sidekick,
00:13:23 this character, I'm frothing at the mouth.
00:13:25 I'm working myself up already.
00:13:26 It's only been 13 minutes.
00:13:28 This character they introduced in the Hulk comics, right?
00:13:31 Or no, Hercules.
00:13:32 Uh, Hercules.
00:13:34 Why are we talking about Hercules?
00:13:36 I'm just trying to remember where
00:13:38 Amadeus Cho was introduced.
00:13:40 Uh, God, you know, it was a little while back.
00:13:42 I don't even remember.
00:13:43 I just remember the comic releasing
00:13:45 and I was just like, oh,
00:13:46 what is this called?
00:13:47 The totally awesome new Hulk?
00:13:49 Yeah.
00:13:50 New Hulk.
00:13:51 And I actually read the comic begrudgingly
00:13:53 because I immediately saw that title
00:13:55 and I hated it.
00:13:56 I was like, this is a stupid title.
00:13:58 This is airing it, this is stupid
00:14:00 and I don't want to read this.
00:14:02 Well, making the Hulk cool,
00:14:04 it's just not what makes the character interesting.
00:14:07 The Hulk is interesting because he's the Hulk.
00:14:09 I mean, if you just have a big strong guy
00:14:11 who's also smart,
00:14:13 that's just the thing.
00:14:14 The thing already exists.
00:14:15 There's already a big strong guy who can talk good.
00:14:18 I mean, as well as the thing, can talk.
00:14:21 Yeah.
00:14:22 Well, I mean...
00:14:23 He is kind of a, like, Brooklyn trash.
00:14:27 He is.
00:14:29 Grumble, grumble, clobber in time.
00:14:31 Oh, Yancey Street.
00:14:32 Uh, my mother,
00:14:34 poker.
00:14:36 Yankees.
00:14:38 Well, I'm not going to lie.
00:14:41 When I did read the totally awesome Hulk
00:14:43 the first time, like the first issue,
00:14:45 I sat there, like, at the end of the issue,
00:14:47 just holding it in my hands, going,
00:14:49 I can't believe I liked this.
00:14:51 I know.
00:14:52 And he's just...
00:14:53 Amadeus Cho as Hulk,
00:14:54 he's just another one of these characters who are like,
00:14:56 they don't want to make new superheroes.
00:14:59 They just want to make new versions
00:15:01 of the guys who already exist.
00:15:03 They want to sap away everything that's special
00:15:06 about the characters we love
00:15:07 and try to, like, put the costume
00:15:09 on some other character,
00:15:11 as though it automatically infuses them with that...
00:15:13 A younger character, no less.
00:15:15 A younger character, a blacker character,
00:15:17 a, you know, a heterosexual,
00:15:19 fucking non-genderqueer, binary...
00:15:22 Well, you know, they have to get ready for the movies.
00:15:24 Down syndrome.
00:15:26 Like, young Stephen Hawking
00:15:28 in, like, a little motorized cart.
00:15:30 They're going to put, like,
00:15:32 they're going to put a Thor helmet
00:15:34 on some, like, sentient tumor
00:15:36 that's, like, growing off of some other guys.
00:15:38 That's the new...
00:15:39 You got to be as inclusive as possible.
00:15:41 You got to represent the sentient tumor
00:15:43 in total recall.
00:15:45 I mean, technically, the helmet is already
00:15:47 on a cancer patient, so...
00:15:49 Yeah, fuck.
00:15:51 Well, there you go.
00:15:53 But it's just because they're getting ready for the movies.
00:15:55 Like, they're pushing these films so hard,
00:15:57 and it's like, they're like,
00:15:58 our actors are getting old.
00:15:59 They're going to be obsolete soon.
00:16:01 We have to create new characters.
00:16:03 I never thought of that.
00:16:04 Do you think that's why?
00:16:05 Because the actors will get old
00:16:06 and they want to be able to, in the movies,
00:16:08 keep them going.
00:16:09 Oh, that is fucking insidious.
00:16:10 That's nefarious.
00:16:12 Yeah.
00:16:13 No, that's...
00:16:14 Well, that's what I think.
00:16:15 Oh.
00:16:16 That's why we're seeing, like, a...
00:16:17 You're probably right.
00:16:18 That's horrifying.
00:16:19 That...
00:16:20 Oh, my God.
00:16:21 You thought that...
00:16:22 You thought that the vision of Trump's America,
00:16:24 you thought that future was bad.
00:16:26 Imagine the future ten years from now,
00:16:28 when Robert Downey is too old to play Iron Man,
00:16:30 and they get some little black girl
00:16:32 to beat Iron Man in the movies,
00:16:33 because they're already doing it in the comics.
00:16:35 Iron Man's a black girl now.
00:16:36 Thor is a cancer woman now.
00:16:38 Fucking Captain America's a black guy.
00:16:40 Miss Marvel's a little girl.
00:16:41 I don't know about the old Miss Marvel, anyways, but...
00:16:43 Well, Doom is also an Iron Man, so...
00:16:46 Oh, that's right.
00:16:47 Dr. Doom is Iron Man now.
00:16:48 Uh-huh.
00:16:49 I forgot about that, because he's got a good face,
00:16:51 and that made him a good person.
00:16:52 Yep.
00:16:53 So, two Iron Men, two Captain America's.
00:16:56 We have one Captain Marvel, one Miss Marvel.
00:16:59 There's fucking five Spider-Man's.
00:17:00 There's gonna be two noes.
00:17:01 There's so many goddamn Spider-Man's.
00:17:02 There's so many...
00:17:03 Oh!
00:17:04 There's Peter.
00:17:05 There's Miles.
00:17:06 There's Silk.
00:17:07 There's Kane.
00:17:08 There's fucking Spider-Gwen.
00:17:09 Kane is the best.
00:17:10 Go on.
00:17:11 Well, Kane...
00:17:12 Yeah, I like him.
00:17:13 He's back.
00:17:14 I'll talk about him in a minute.
00:17:15 And then Renew Your Vows.
00:17:16 That's the thing now.
00:17:17 Yep.
00:17:18 Mary Jane is a Spider-Man.
00:17:19 Their daughter is a Spider-Man.
00:17:20 Well, it seems like every couple of years, Mary Jane becomes a superhero
00:17:23 for like one issue, and then they forget about it.
00:17:25 She was already an Invincible Iron Man.
00:17:27 Oh, my God.
00:17:28 Mary Jane as Tony Stark's secretary.
00:17:31 I'm getting ahead of myself, but I'm just so angry about everything having to do with Spider-Man
00:17:36 for the last ten fucking years!
00:17:38 Oh!
00:17:39 I'm not even there yet.
00:17:40 I'm getting ahead of myself.
00:17:41 I'm gonna fucking burst.
00:17:42 Thinking about Spider-Man has been like a non-stop await on my soul.
00:17:46 Like, I'm constantly...
00:17:47 If people want to know the source of my anger, it's because for the last ten years of Marvel
00:17:53 Spider-Man comics, I'm constantly on the verge of committing like a...
00:17:57 Like that game hatred.
00:17:58 A genocide crusade.
00:17:59 All right, go out in black and white with a shotgun and start killing people because
00:18:03 of what they've done to Spider-Man.
00:18:04 But I'm getting ahead of myself.
00:18:06 I'll get there eventually.
00:18:07 And I'm still yelling about champions right now.
00:18:09 Okay?
00:18:10 So that's...
00:18:11 Okay, so the theme is...
00:18:12 Nova who I hate and isn't interesting.
00:18:14 Amadeus Chohulk who I hate and isn't interesting.
00:18:18 Fucking...
00:18:19 Who else?
00:18:20 What's the other...
00:18:21 Miles Morales, the little black Spider-Man from the Ultimate Universe who isn't interesting.
00:18:25 He was.
00:18:26 I haven't been reading his comments lately, though.
00:18:28 Okay.
00:18:29 What is his origin now in the new Marvel Universe?
00:18:31 It doesn't make any sense anymore.
00:18:33 Wasn't...
00:18:34 Okay, I think that the thing...
00:18:35 Miles Morales was a character who was introduced in the Ultimate Comics.
00:18:39 The Ultimate Comics were like Marvel's attempt to sort of make like a second universe to
00:18:43 kind of get new readers in in like the early 2000s.
00:18:46 And it was sort of like retelling of like contemporary origins of superheroes.
00:18:50 And it was a really big success.
00:18:52 There were a lot of really great stories, especially in the early part of the Ultimate Universe.
00:18:56 Ultimate Spider-Man was fantastic for like the first hundred issues.
00:18:59 Oh yeah.
00:19:00 But eventually it kind of crumbled in on itself.
00:19:03 And the weight of its own continuity became too much.
00:19:06 And it turned to shit.
00:19:07 And there was a lot of weird stuff that happened.
00:19:08 What's going on with my haunted door over there?
00:19:10 It's slowly creaking itself open.
00:19:12 Boo Radley is going to come in here and rape us both for Trump.
00:19:16 I had a dream like that once.
00:19:19 But so the Ultimate Universe lasted for like ten years.
00:19:22 And it eventually crumbled in on itself.
00:19:24 And it started having some really awful stories that everyone hated.
00:19:27 Like Ultimatum where like the blob ate the wasp.
00:19:31 And there was like this really graphic panel of him like munching on her intestines and shit.
00:19:35 Yep, I remember that.
00:19:36 And like there was a tidal wave and a million people died.
00:19:39 Anyways.
00:19:40 And Scarlet Witch and Silver, what's his name?
00:19:42 It's Quicksilver.
00:19:43 They're fucking?
00:19:44 They're like a sinister thing going on?
00:19:45 Yeah.
00:19:46 But everybody.
00:19:47 Oh, and like Ultimate Wolverine fucked like teenage Jean Grey.
00:19:50 Yep.
00:19:51 Oh, that was so creepy.
00:19:52 That was where I like I signed out where I stopped reading the Ultimate X-Men comics.
00:19:55 I stuck around with Ultimate Spider-Man for a while, but...
00:19:57 Because it was Jean Grey or because she was a teenager?
00:20:00 Not because she's a teenager.
00:20:02 I'm a hundred percent for having sex with teenagers.
00:20:04 I think it's what...
00:20:05 I think that'll make America great again.
00:20:07 If we all...
00:20:08 If we lower the age of consent to like twelve and a half,
00:20:11 I think that would make this country great again.
00:20:13 But um, I just think Wolverine should never ever ever have sex with Jean Grey.
00:20:19 Because it's a...
00:20:20 It's like a vital part of his character.
00:20:22 We're like...
00:20:23 Forever pining for the world.
00:20:24 Well, like Wolverine...
00:20:27 We're going off in so many different directions right now,
00:20:30 but I mean like Wolverine, you know, in the old Claremont X-Men stories,
00:20:35 he was introduced as like, you know, the rebel of the team.
00:20:38 The guy who's always a loner and he's always grumpy.
00:20:41 He doesn't get along with anyone.
00:20:42 But like a huge...
00:20:44 Like he falls in love with Jean Grey,
00:20:46 but like this huge vital part of his growth as a character
00:20:50 is accepting that it is not meant to be with Jean Grey
00:20:53 and accepting that, you know, he can love her deeply, passionately, forever,
00:20:59 but it's not to be and like going off to Japan and marrying Mariko Yoshida
00:21:04 and like it made him be a better person.
00:21:07 It was like his like...
00:21:08 That was his source of growth in the X-Men comics in the Claremont era.
00:21:12 And um, so it just feels like a weird grimy, slimy betrayal to me
00:21:18 to ever have Wolverine fuck Jean Grey.
00:21:22 It just kind of makes...
00:21:23 I'm like totally like anti-shipping for that one.
00:21:25 I don't like it.
00:21:26 It's creepy.
00:21:27 Every time I see it in anything, it creeps me out.
00:21:29 And now they've got...
00:21:30 I'm going up on so many tangent.
00:21:32 Now they've got Old Man Logan and Teenie Bopper Jean Grey
00:21:34 and I swear to God, they're gonna have him fuck her.
00:21:37 They're gonna have 90 year old Wolverine fuck 16 year old Jean Grey
00:21:40 and I know that I just said that I love fucking little girls,
00:21:43 but something about it being those two characters
00:21:46 really sickens me on a primal level and I don't want it.
00:21:49 I don't like it.
00:21:50 I don't like it.
00:21:52 It's not feminist is what it is.
00:21:53 You know, Donald Trump's gonna be president
00:21:55 and suddenly Wolverine's gonna be fucking little baby Jean Grey.
00:21:58 I know I'm flip-flopping on my feelings for Donald Trump,
00:22:00 like every five minutes.
00:22:01 I go from making fun of him to like praising him.
00:22:05 To back to making fun of him.
00:22:07 It's just funny.
00:22:08 Everything about Donald Trump is hilarious to me.
00:22:10 Except for the fact that all my friends are turning on me
00:22:12 for not voting for Hillary Clinton enough.
00:22:14 Yeah, um...
00:22:17 I actually really like the Old Man Logan series.
00:22:20 Oh yeah, Old Man Logan.
00:22:21 Everything like the original series was fantastic.
00:22:24 And the news, the ongoing is really good too.
00:22:26 Definitely marriage writing for it, if I remember right.
00:22:28 And he's one of my favorite writers.
00:22:29 What the fuck was I even talking about?
00:22:31 I was talking about like Wolverine and Jean Grey.
00:22:33 Right, winding back you were asking about Miles Morales.
00:22:36 What is his origins?
00:22:37 Get my fucking eye of Agamotto and fucking turn back the clock.
00:22:40 Roll back the clock to the dawn of time.
00:22:42 That's the fucking weird back reference.
00:22:44 You weren't expecting that, were you people?
00:22:45 That was a Doctor Strange reference combined with a weird back.
00:22:49 A dinosaur story reference.
00:22:50 That was like, nobody can do this shit but me.
00:22:52 I've got so much in my brain.
00:22:54 These fucking spider webs firing off synapses
00:22:57 in so many fucking wild directions.
00:22:59 That's why I'm the best there is at what I do.
00:23:02 And what I do ain't cool.
00:23:06 Now you were asking about Miles Morales and like what even is...
00:23:09 Right, okay.
00:23:10 So the origin of Miles Morales before the ultimate...
00:23:13 Fuck, there's so much to unpack here with comics.
00:23:16 That's why I was so like pumped up and like pacing back and forth
00:23:21 to like do this panel cast because there's so much to do.
00:23:24 Everything with comics that you talk about,
00:23:26 you have to talk about 10,000 other things.
00:23:28 Everything has 70 years of history before it
00:23:31 to even get to your point.
00:23:33 It's so stressful.
00:23:34 But Marvel in particular is bad.
00:23:36 So okay, the ultimate universe, you know,
00:23:38 there was a bunch of big events where like a million superheroes died.
00:23:40 Everyone started to hate it.
00:23:41 The people started turning on the ultimate Marvel universe
00:23:44 pretty strongly and they finally decided,
00:23:46 okay, it's run its course.
00:23:48 We got to fold it.
00:23:49 We got to sort of fold it into the main Marvel universe.
00:23:53 So all the characters that were popular,
00:23:55 which I mean just Miles Morales because he was the only person
00:23:58 still alive in the ultimate universe by the end of it.
00:24:00 Yep.
00:24:01 But so they did a big event last year
00:24:04 where Dr. Doom did some magic fuckery
00:24:08 and became king of the world for a while.
00:24:10 It combined like the Marvel multiverse into one planet.
00:24:13 Secret Wars.
00:24:14 Yeah, and the end of it,
00:24:17 the fallout from it was just that, you know,
00:24:19 the Marvel universe sort of combined
00:24:21 with the ultimate Marvel universe and sort of...
00:24:23 They pulled the same thing that DC did with the New 52.
00:24:26 Yeah.
00:24:27 Like after, it wasn't convergence.
00:24:28 It was the one before that. Flashpoint.
00:24:30 It wasn't as badly done as the New 52 though.
00:24:32 I mean it was, I liked last year's event,
00:24:35 for an event, I hate them all,
00:24:37 but I thought that the Secret Wars was decent.
00:24:39 It was fine.
00:24:40 Yeah.
00:24:41 It just took a really long time to finish.
00:24:42 Yeah.
00:24:43 And I think a lot of people lost interest in that.
00:24:44 But yeah, the main Marvel universe
00:24:46 folded in on the ultimate Marvel universe
00:24:48 and they adopted Miles Morales.
00:24:51 I'm gonna barf.
00:24:52 I'm barfing.
00:24:55 All this over the champions?
00:24:57 Yeah, the champions...
00:24:58 It's not even finished.
00:25:00 It's a lift issue too.
00:25:05 I know already you wanna barf.
00:25:06 Okay, Miles Morales was a character
00:25:09 invented in the ultimate Marvel universe by Bendis.
00:25:12 Yeah, Michael Bendis.
00:25:14 So, he was the little black Spider-Man.
00:25:16 He was a guy...
00:25:17 I don't know...
00:25:18 I might be wrong.
00:25:19 Correct me if I get anything.
00:25:20 She was fucking giving me so much grief earlier.
00:25:23 You go on that panel cast
00:25:24 and everything you fucking say isn't correct.
00:25:26 You get so much stuff wrong.
00:25:28 What?
00:25:29 You fucking...
00:25:30 Why am I always made out to be the bad guy?
00:25:33 I don't know, because it's funny.
00:25:34 Because I'm a woman.
00:25:35 Exactly.
00:25:36 This is Trump's world now.
00:25:38 I'm allowed to be sexist.
00:25:39 It's Trump's world now.
00:25:43 So, he was a guy who got bitten.
00:25:45 Was it the same spider that bit Peter?
00:25:48 Like the exact literal same spider.
00:25:50 Unlike the same day?
00:25:51 Or was it different?
00:25:52 Because I don't even know.
00:25:53 I don't remember.
00:25:54 But he had spider powers too.
00:25:55 And I think like he wasn't doing anything with them.
00:25:57 They had a big event called Ultimatum.
00:25:59 Spider-Man died.
00:26:00 Did he die in Ultimatum?
00:26:02 Yeah, I think.
00:26:03 Peter Parker died.
00:26:04 Yeah, he died.
00:26:05 And, um, you know, so Spider-Man died.
00:26:09 And everyone was really inspired by Spider-Man's heroic death.
00:26:12 And Miles Morales, this kid who had spider powers,
00:26:15 but didn't do anything with them, he said,
00:26:17 oh my god, Spider-Man died.
00:26:19 And here I am doing fuck all with my spider powers.
00:26:22 And that's how he learned about responsibility
00:26:25 and that whole thing.
00:26:27 Yeah, but it was followed up by a whole mess of things.
00:26:29 And then he became Spider-Man, basically.
00:26:30 We haven't even gotten to the meat potatoes yet.
00:26:32 Okay, there's Nova, who I hate.
00:26:34 Amadeus Cho, who I hate.
00:26:36 Miles Morales, who I hate.
00:26:38 That was my point.
00:26:39 That's why I got him the Ultimate Universe fucking story.
00:26:41 Because now that he's in the-
00:26:43 The main Marvel Universe?
00:26:45 Yeah, in the main Marvel Universe, Spider-Man never died.
00:26:48 So why is Miles Morales a Spider-Man?
00:26:51 What is his new origin?
00:26:53 I mean, if he's still got the powers, why not?
00:26:55 What are they gonna do?
00:26:56 Go back home?
00:26:57 That's stupid.
00:26:58 That robs him of all of his coolness, I think.
00:27:01 Yeah, and I saw recently some new issues coming out.
00:27:04 I guess him and Spider-Gwen are gonna be a thing at some point.
00:27:07 Oh my god.
00:27:09 No.
00:27:10 How old is Spider-Gwen?
00:27:12 I don't know.
00:27:14 Same age?
00:27:15 Isn't she Cradle-Grobbing?
00:27:16 Shouldn't she be Peter Parker's age?
00:27:17 Aren't they both like 16?
00:27:19 See, I don't keep up with their ages very well because they never age.
00:27:22 Or they reverse ages.
00:27:24 Or they just kind of-
00:27:25 It's different in every single comic.
00:27:29 How fucking old is Gwenpool?
00:27:31 I don't know.
00:27:32 When she was introduced last year in Howard the Duck,
00:27:35 the way that she was drawn made her seem like she's 27, our age, an adult.
00:27:42 Maybe.
00:27:43 But then you read her ongoing, and maybe it's just because of the change in art style.
00:27:49 Now she looks like she's a teenager.
00:27:51 They can't even keep-
00:27:53 That's like a real huge pet peeve of mine, is Marvel being fucky about the characters' ages.
00:28:00 Like, in universe, the Fantastic Four were the first heroes,
00:28:05 and they started, I mean technically like the original human torch,
00:28:09 the robot-looking guy.
00:28:11 But for all intents and purposes, in Marvel continuity history,
00:28:15 the age of superhero started with the Fantastic Four,
00:28:18 which is generally considered to be 15 years ago.
00:28:22 Right?
00:28:23 And then pretty soon after them,
00:28:25 15-year-old Spider-Man got bit by the spider.
00:28:28 So when I read comics, to me, I always feel like Peter Parker should be 29, 30 years old, an adult.
00:28:37 But they always want to make him like younger, like his early 20s, and it makes no sense.
00:28:43 The timeline of Marvel is so fucky.
00:28:45 I hate it.
00:28:46 I can't stand it.
00:28:47 It drives me crazy.
00:28:49 How old is Scott Summers?
00:28:50 He should also be in his 30s.
00:28:52 No, no.
00:28:53 That's an alternate dimension, Scott Summers.
00:28:55 I don't- oh.
00:28:56 Oh.
00:28:57 Oh.
00:28:58 Oh.
00:28:59 Here we go.
00:29:00 Oh.
00:29:01 That's right.
00:29:02 How could I forget about the original Five X-Men,
00:29:05 who got fucking shucky-ducky-quacked-quacked into the modern age?
00:29:10 Yeah, no.
00:29:11 That's supposed to be the Scott Summers that becomes an evil, tyrannical person.
00:29:15 I'm sorry.
00:29:16 This is the most like cluster fuck panel cast that has ever existed.
00:29:19 I'm so riled right now about everything.
00:29:23 I haven't even like- we haven't- I have like notes here that we haven't gotten to get all
00:29:27 the comics that I actually read this week that I haven't talked about yet.
00:29:30 You are technically still yelling about champions.
00:29:32 This is all connected.
00:29:33 I hate champions so much.
00:29:36 But moving on.
00:29:38 Nova, who I hate.
00:29:39 Amadeus Chohulk, who I hate and is not interesting.
00:29:43 Who is the other guy?
00:29:44 Miles Morales, who is not interesting and I don't like him and I don't care about him.
00:29:47 Scott.
00:29:48 Oh, young Scott.
00:29:50 Young Scott Summers.
00:29:53 Teeny Bopper Cyclops.
00:29:58 So, a couple years ago in the pages of X-Men.
00:30:02 No, wait.
00:30:03 I have to start this story 10 years ago.
00:30:05 Oh no.
00:30:06 I have to start it at like Grant Morrison's new X-Men.
00:30:09 This is-
00:30:10 When Grant Morrison, you know, after fucking years of Cyclops existing and nobody liking
00:30:15 him when Grant Morrison in the 2000s made Cyclops the coolest fucking character of all time
00:30:20 and then Joss Whedon made him even fucking cooler after that.
00:30:23 You know, he started fucking Emma Frost.
00:30:25 He started, you know, kicking major amounts of ass.
00:30:28 He like, the character evolved from like, you know, Cyclops was always this like stoic,
00:30:33 you know, the Leonardo, the nobody's favorite.
00:30:36 The guy who's just there for Wolverine to bounce off and be the rebel who everyone likes.
00:30:40 He was like the uptight, rule Nazi who, you know-
00:30:44 The principal.
00:30:45 Yeah, the principal.
00:30:46 That was how people viewed Cyclops forever.
00:30:48 That's how I viewed Cyclops as a kid.
00:30:50 Watching the animated series as a kid, I liked Gambit and Wolverine and I never cared about Cyclops.
00:30:55 It's like the Breakfast Club principal.
00:30:57 Yeah.
00:30:58 But, you know, in the early 2000s, these two fucking, these golden gods descended from the heavens
00:31:06 and their names were Grant Morrison and Joss Whedon and they said, hey, shouldn't Cyclops be fucking cool?
00:31:12 If he's the leader of the coolest fucking team, shouldn't he logically be the coolest fucking guy?
00:31:18 And they put in all this work, they made these storylines where Cyclops like grew as a character
00:31:23 and he turned from this uptight sort of rule Nazi who nobody liked into this sort of like maverick,
00:31:29 take no prisoners fucking super stud who was like always five steps ahead of the enemy.
00:31:34 This like tactical genius who was willing to break the rules.
00:31:38 He fucking started like just kicking everyone's ass, you know.
00:31:41 He started like, like, like Magneto started becoming more of a good guy
00:31:45 and Cyclops became this like, this perfect combination of Xavier and Magneto's philosophies.
00:31:51 Like, he took the best from both of these, like, from like the Malcolm X and the other guy, Martin Luther King.
00:31:59 That's who they always represented, those two characters.
00:32:03 And Cyclops became this like amalgamation, taking in the best of both of their philosophies
00:32:08 and coming this like mutant hero, this like outlaw hero, this badass
00:32:13 who like suddenly Cyclops is the coolest fucking character to read about
00:32:17 and that continued for like a good ten years and they just kept upping the ante.
00:32:20 Suddenly you get to like, like when they move to San Francisco
00:32:24 where like, where they started the Utopia and Cyclops, he like gets his own island fortress for all the X-Men
00:32:31 and he's flying around in a fucking jetpack and he's like riding in convertibles
00:32:35 and he's like, yeah, I'm fucking Cyclops, I fuck the hottest girls, I got eye beams, I'm the coolest guy ever!
00:32:42 He's the best character ever. I fucking love Cyclops, he's awesome.
00:32:47 And like, he became like, they like slowly had him becoming like really good friends with Wolverine
00:32:53 and they were like, they had this like buddy cop thing going on for a while
00:32:56 where they like had grown to respect each other over all this and that's what I fucking love.
00:33:00 I love like, when the continuity from all these years of stories manifests as characters,
00:33:05 their relationships changing and growing together because, you know, Wolverine and Cyclops
00:33:11 who like butted heads for like 40 years, suddenly Cyclops has become this badass
00:33:15 and Wolverine has grown into this like mature, you know, hero
00:33:19 and they've become like really good friends and instead of like fighting over Jean, now she's dead
00:33:24 and they're like kind of bonded over their love for Jean and they're like best buddies and it was great
00:33:28 and it's this beautiful era of X-Men comics where I'm like, you know, all's right with the world
00:33:34 and then stuff started getting fucky. You know, Marvel can't let a good thing exist for too long.
00:33:41 They gotta fuck themselves in some way. They gotta rock the boat.
00:33:45 There was this storyline called Schism where like, in the pages of Wolverine's comic,
00:33:53 Wolverine's ongoing by Jason Aaron who is a great writer who I love.
00:33:57 I loved his Wolverine. I loved his Thor before he started doing the girl thing.
00:34:03 There was a storyline with this group of people who wanted revenge on Wolverine
00:34:08 and it was like the brilliant plan to finally, like Wolverine had wronged them all at some point in his long life
00:34:14 and they had planned this, they had schemed this revenge for so long
00:34:17 and all of these guys, these like weird super villains, showed up to beat up Wolverine
00:34:22 and he kills all of them. But then at the end you find out that the main, like his ultimate plan
00:34:27 was that all of these like weird super villains who Wolverine has killed were actually like his illegitimate children.
00:34:33 Like Wolverine's, like because he's been around, Wolverine fucks. He's a man who fucks.
00:34:38 He's been around fucking, he's sired so many illegitimate bastards that this guy collected them all
00:34:45 and turned them into super villains and had Wolverine kill his own children so that he could reveal it to him
00:34:50 and it's like this devastating blow. And so like Wolverine in character, this was a nice bit of character building
00:34:56 because Wolverine suddenly, Wolverine goes fucking crazy and he goes,
00:35:00 we can't fucking have children fighting our battles anymore. We have to protect kids. I murdered all my children.
00:35:05 So Wolverine is going apeshit and he's like, I don't wanna, you know, we can't have kids fighting anymore
00:35:10 but at this point Cyclops has matured into the opposite direction
00:35:14 and he's become this like badass motherfucker like no, this is a war. We're at war with the world.
00:35:19 We have to have children fight our battles. So they butt heads and I thought Schism was a pretty good story.
00:35:24 You know, I hated it because it was sad to see a friendship be ruined but it was cool. It was well written.
00:35:32 What am I even fucking talking about? You see, you have to go so far back to even get to where we're talking about.
00:35:38 Um, we were talking about champions and how much you hated Scott.
00:35:45 This is gonna be a five hour podcast and it's just gonna be champions going into the history of the Marvel Universe
00:35:51 that you need to understand and order to understand why I hate everything about this one comic that I read last week.
00:35:57 So we went down the list of people you hate.
00:36:01 Oh no, no, no, no, I'm not even done. I'm not done talking about Teenie Bopper Scott.
00:36:05 I haven't even gotten to him yet. That's what started this.
00:36:08 No.
00:36:09 Okay, so we're at this point. I have to take my sweater off. I'm fucking, I got the hot sweats.
00:36:13 Ah!
00:36:18 Ah, comics.
00:36:25 So this is like, now we're up to like, this was like 2009, a couple years, like seven years ago.
00:36:31 Schism I think happened six years ago.
00:36:34 Fuck.
00:36:35 So now we're at this point where there's two teams of X-Men.
00:36:38 Wolverine has taken a bunch of the children. He's gone back to New York and started a new Xavier Institute.
00:36:42 He calls it the Jean Grey Institute.
00:36:44 So Wolverine is now dedicated to, I guess, protecting the kids.
00:36:49 And like, Wolverine has become dedicated to Xavier's dream.
00:36:54 He started a new school for gifted youngsters. He's wearing a suit and tie.
00:36:58 He's trying to be like a changed man, a principal.
00:37:02 Meanwhile, Cyclops is over here in like the San Francisco area in Utopia.
00:37:08 And he's become like a bad, like they've switched.
00:37:11 Cyclops has become the rebel and Wolverine has become the uptight sort of rules Nazi.
00:37:17 And it gets worse with like AVX.
00:37:20 Oh yeah, I'm getting to that, baby. I'm getting to it.
00:37:23 So, so that's how the characters had matured and that's good maturation.
00:37:28 That's good character growth. It's interesting to read about.
00:37:34 But um, oh yeah, throughout all of this, Beast has become the worst person who ever existed.
00:37:41 Should I get to Beast yet? I'm not even at Beast yet.
00:37:43 Oh no, he's not even a part of the Chieftains.
00:37:45 I have to, I have to, I have to start.
00:37:47 Well, it's his fault that teeny bopper Cyclops exists.
00:37:50 So I have to talk about Beast and that's going to be another hour.
00:37:53 Because they ruined Beast 2 in a way that's so insidious, I'll get to it.
00:37:57 But I have to talk about, okay, so there's fucking Wolverine has a school, Cyclops has an island.
00:38:02 And they don't like each other anymore.
00:38:04 And now there's this event called Avengers vs X-Men.
00:38:07 And it's the worst thing that ever happened.
00:38:10 To that point. Worse things happened after it.
00:38:13 But um, basically the Phoenix Force, it's coming back to Earth.
00:38:18 And Cyclops and the Avengers, they don't like each other.
00:38:21 And they got a fight. I'm getting, you have to explain this one.
00:38:25 Because I need a break.
00:38:28 So on AVX, the Phoenix Force returns to Earth and decides to split itself between five chosen people.
00:38:33 It's either five or six, I can't remember.
00:38:35 Cyclops wanted it to go to Hope.
00:38:37 Who is his...
00:38:39 Illigent, like his child from a different dimension. I don't, whatever.
00:38:43 She was the first new mutant born.
00:38:45 She was the first new mutant born after House of M.
00:38:49 Mutant stopped being born.
00:38:51 And she was the most powerful mutant that anyone had ever seen.
00:38:53 She had the potential to reignite the mutant race.
00:38:56 And she was raised by Cable in the future.
00:38:59 Cable is Cyclops's son from an alternate future.
00:39:03 And he comes back sometimes and he's a time travel guy with a big gun and he's really cool and everybody likes him.
00:39:08 He has a lot of pouches and a big shoulder pad.
00:39:11 Cable is a good man. He raises the girl.
00:39:15 Her name is Hope Summers now. She's like Scott's adopted granddaughter, I guess.
00:39:19 And she looks just like Jean.
00:39:21 Because everyone who is important in X-Men comics is a redhead who looks like Jean.
00:39:24 I don't know why. Nobody knows why.
00:39:26 The Phoenix Force.
00:39:28 Cyclops wants it to go to her because it's going to come to Earth no matter what.
00:39:32 And it might destroy everyone unless it is harnessed by the right person.
00:39:36 So Cyclops in his infinite wisdom because Cyclops is the only smart person in the Marvel Universe.
00:39:41 He's the only superhero who's still a superhero. The only guy I trust anymore.
00:39:45 Cyclops says, okay, look, it's coming here.
00:39:48 It's going to destroy everyone unless we train Hope to harness the fucking Phoenix Force.
00:39:53 We know how to do this. We're the X-Men. We've been handling the Phoenix for fucking 50 years.
00:39:58 Just let me handle it. I know what I'm doing.
00:40:00 But the Avengers, they just shit all over.
00:40:02 No.
00:40:03 Because...
00:40:05 Because fuck you?
00:40:06 Because in order for these event comics to work, in order for these superhero battles to work...
00:40:10 There has to be conflict.
00:40:11 One side always has to be made up of idiots.
00:40:14 One side is always out of character, always retarded.
00:40:17 So the Avengers, Captain America becomes this weird, brain-dead, fascist asshole who's like, fuck you.
00:40:24 We have to kill the 15-year-old girl. We have to murder her because I'm a fearful, hate-mongering idiot.
00:40:30 You know, I enjoyed AVX to an extent.
00:40:33 So they fight, basically.
00:40:34 Yeah. They do fight, and it was stupid because they separated all the fights into like its own thing.
00:40:39 Yeah.
00:40:40 And the fights were always stupid.
00:40:42 It's like, well, clearly, who would win in a fight with the Thing vs. Namor deep at the bottom of the ocean?
00:40:49 Yeah.
00:40:50 Well, I guess clearly the Thing does.
00:40:52 Yeah.
00:40:53 Yeah.
00:40:54 Who wins in a fight between Iron Man and Magneto?
00:40:58 Apparently Iron Man somehow.
00:41:01 Even though he's made of the stuff that Magneto's one power.
00:41:04 Magneto has one power, killing Iron Man.
00:41:08 That was one of my favorite bits in the entire AVX dialogue.
00:41:13 Iron Man's like, you can't do nothing to me, Magneto.
00:41:16 This suit isn't something that you can manipulate.
00:41:18 Magneto's like, oh no, whatever shall I do as he drops the Golden Gate Bridge on Iron Man.
00:41:25 Like, are you kidding me?
00:41:26 And Daredo vs. Cylock, I wonder who would win?
00:41:30 Nobody, I guess.
00:41:31 They can just do it on the rooftop or something.
00:41:34 So anyways, the fallout of AVX.
00:41:36 Ugh.
00:41:37 Because Captain America, you know, stuck his dick in the punch bowl and basically fucked
00:41:42 with the X-Men and made this problem 10,000 times worse than it needed to be.
00:41:47 What happened was the Phoenix Force ended up getting split and it went into five people.
00:41:51 It went into Cyclops, Emma Frost, Colossus, Magic, Namor.
00:41:57 And so they became the Phoenix Five and they took over the fucking world.
00:42:02 But they fixed the world.
00:42:04 Yeah, it wasn't even like forceful per se.
00:42:06 Like, we want to help the Earth.
00:42:08 They didn't become tyrants or despots.
00:42:10 They didn't become corrupted by it.
00:42:12 They literally fixed the world.
00:42:14 They ended all crime.
00:42:15 The Marvel Universe was at peace for a brief span and Captain America fucking hated it.
00:42:20 That really burned his bacon.
00:42:22 That another superhero saved the world forever and not him.
00:42:26 The Avengers wanted to be the glory hogs, basically.
00:42:28 How dare you create world peace forever and end hunger and end suffering throughout the entire planet?
00:42:35 How dare you actually be superheroes with this power that I don't approve of?
00:42:40 So they kept pestering them.
00:42:42 They kept fucking poking the bear and kicking the hornet's nest.
00:42:46 You know, Captain America and the Avengers became like this weird mosquito constantly pestering Cyclops,
00:42:52 who was fucking busy fixing the world.
00:42:54 And eventually they pushed him so far that they caused the Phoenix to briefly go corrupted.
00:43:00 They caused Cyclops to lose control and the fallout was that in a moment of rage, he killed Charles Xavier.
00:43:07 And everyone hated him for it forever.
00:43:11 Even though no one in the Marvel Universe has ever respected the X-Men,
00:43:15 even though nobody has ever respected Charles Xavier,
00:43:18 suddenly because they have a hate boner for Scott,
00:43:21 Scott's the worst person who ever lived.
00:43:23 Scott is now mutant Hitler.
00:43:24 He's worse than Magneto ever was in The Avengers Eyes.
00:43:28 I want a shirt that says Magneto is right.
00:43:30 I do want that shirt. It's a good shirt.
00:43:32 I want a shirt that says Cyclops was right.
00:43:34 That's another good one.
00:43:35 And that became like a meme for many years.
00:43:38 Still to this day, unlike 4chan and Ko and stuff,
00:43:41 the Cyclops was right meme.
00:43:43 Because Cyclops was right.
00:43:45 They tried to portray it.
00:43:50 They still try to portray it.
00:43:52 Like he went evil. He went rogue.
00:43:54 He's a bad guy now.
00:43:56 But he's not.
00:43:57 Everything he does is logical and noble.
00:44:01 But the narrative wants you to think that he's become like Magneto at his worst,
00:44:06 even though he's become the greatest hero in the Marvel Universe.
00:44:09 It's one of those weird things where the narrative doesn't understand
00:44:13 how the people are reading it.
00:44:15 It doesn't understand how badly it's written.
00:44:17 Whatever makes sales, I guess.
00:44:19 Whatever continues it.
00:44:21 So the fallout of all this is that even though Scott was totally in the right
00:44:24 for the entire...always.
00:44:26 Scott has always been in the right and he always will be.
00:44:28 All the superheroes hate Cyclops.
00:44:31 He's considered a pariah now.
00:44:33 He's a bad guy.
00:44:34 He has to live in an old Weapon X facility
00:44:36 in the fucking frozen tundra in Canada.
00:44:38 Because it's the only place where the cops won't come for him.
00:44:41 He has like a secret team of X-Men.
00:44:44 And okay.
00:44:46 So everyone hates Cyclops for no reason.
00:44:49 Now we get to Beast.
00:44:52 You remember Beast, right?
00:44:54 Henry McCoy on the X-Men, the animated series.
00:44:57 He's this...you know...
00:44:59 He's an archetype.
00:45:00 He's a character that everyone understands.
00:45:02 He looks like a monster.
00:45:04 He looks like a beast.
00:45:05 But he has the mind of a genius.
00:45:07 He's a brave, noble, compassionate soul
00:45:10 dwelling in the body of this abomination.
00:45:14 That's what makes the character interesting.
00:45:16 The fact that he looks like a big scary gorilla man,
00:45:19 but he's a great person.
00:45:22 Marvel didn't like that, I guess.
00:45:24 At some point, slowly, this happened insidiously
00:45:29 over the last decade or so.
00:45:31 They slowly turned the beast that everyone knows and loves
00:45:36 into the worst person who ever lived.
00:45:39 Like, the beast has become the supervillain
00:45:44 that Marvel thinks Cyclops has become.
00:45:49 I agreed X-Men comics and I want a barf.
00:45:52 Like, I don't know, he gets...
00:45:56 So the beast does all these horrible things for a decade
00:46:00 and is never called out on it in the narrative,
00:46:03 except for one time, in one glorious comic
00:46:05 where the Watcher showed up in Beast Room.
00:46:08 Do you know what I'm talking about?
00:46:09 Um, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:46:10 There was one comic where the Watcher...
00:46:12 The Watcher is like the narrator of the entire Marvel Universe.
00:46:16 Well, it was.
00:46:17 But, uh, you know, his job is to watch.
00:46:21 He's the audience surrogate for the Marvel Universe.
00:46:24 He's a cosmic guy who watches everything that happens.
00:46:26 The Marvel Warrior.
00:46:27 Yeah.
00:46:28 And there was this one comic, I forget which one it was,
00:46:31 but where, like, the Watcher just comes into Hank's room at night
00:46:35 and he wakes him up and he goes, I am the Watcher.
00:46:37 I have seen all that was and all that will be.
00:46:41 Hank McCoy, you are the worst person I've ever met.
00:46:44 And I'm like, I really feel like that page was written
00:46:48 by, like, some disgruntled guy at Marvel
00:46:50 who saw what was happening and wanted to have his say
00:46:53 before they fired him.
00:46:54 I wish I knew who wrote it.
00:46:56 But, um, so they had, like, ten years of, like,
00:47:02 everyone vilifying Scott while the Beast was quietly turning
00:47:05 into, like, the worst person who ever lived.
00:47:07 And it culminated in this really awful storyline.
00:47:11 This awful bloated, like, three-year storyline
00:47:13 by Brian Michael Bendis where, like, the Beast,
00:47:17 in order to teach Cyclops a lesson to show him
00:47:20 how far Cyclops had fallen, he invented a time machine
00:47:24 and he brought the original five X-Men from, like,
00:47:27 the 60s as teenagers back into the present.
00:47:31 I guess to traumatize them and show them
00:47:34 how horrible the Marvel universe is.
00:47:37 I guess his plan that, like, his genius plan
00:47:41 was that Cyclops would see his younger self and go,
00:47:44 oh, I guess I've become Hitler.
00:47:47 I guess you were right all along, Beast.
00:47:50 Whoops.
00:47:52 But instead what happened is he brought the original five X-Men
00:47:55 here, these teenagers, from the past.
00:47:57 Cyclops, Gene Gray, Iceman, Younger Beast, and Angel.
00:48:02 And, um, he couldn't get them back.
00:48:05 The time machine only worked one way.
00:48:07 He built a one-way time machine.
00:48:09 That's how fucking retarded he is.
00:48:11 Um, so they're stuck there to this day, but...
00:48:15 There's so much wrong with that.
00:48:18 Yeah.
00:48:19 Go on.
00:48:20 So he's created all kinds of horrible paradox
00:48:22 that really, like, that break the entire Marvel universe
00:48:24 if you think about them too hard.
00:48:26 Um, so instead of his plan working,
00:48:29 instead of showing present Scott how far he had fallen
00:48:33 in Beast's eyes, it just made Scott, like, more angry at Beast
00:48:37 and more righteous.
00:48:38 And it made everyone angry at Beast,
00:48:40 and they kicked him out of the X-Men, and he joined the Inhumans.
00:48:42 The Inhumans are, like, the bag serial X-Men.
00:48:45 I don't have the energy to talk about how much I hate the Inhumans,
00:48:48 but I will next week, maybe.
00:48:50 Um...
00:48:52 You know, on that note, IVX is going to be a thing soon.
00:48:56 It is going to be a thing.
00:48:58 Um...
00:49:00 But after Death of X, after Death of X, we gotta wait for that.
00:49:03 Fucking...
00:49:05 The Beast was a bad guy.
00:49:07 So basically, he invented a one-way time machine,
00:49:11 like a fucking dummy,
00:49:13 and he brought these teenage X-Men to the present,
00:49:16 and they're still there.
00:49:18 This was, like, three or four years ago this happened.
00:49:21 They're not even teenagers anymore.
00:49:22 They haven't been sent back.
00:49:24 They're still there, just fucking around the Marvel universe,
00:49:27 ruining continuity with their very presence,
00:49:30 ruining everything, making everything dumb,
00:49:32 making the whole universe dumber,
00:49:34 and... fuck.
00:49:38 Getting sweats.
00:49:39 I'm pouring right now.
00:49:43 So anyways...
00:49:45 And they just want to kill off Cyclops.
00:49:48 That's, like, the crux of why I hate it so much.
00:49:50 Well, they did.
00:49:51 Yeah, they did.
00:49:52 He's dead.
00:49:53 But now he's back again.
00:49:55 Younger, not evil yet.
00:49:57 Yeah, they want Cyclops to be killed off
00:50:00 so that they can have a younger version of Cyclops
00:50:02 and reset the character arc,
00:50:04 and get rid of all the character development.
00:50:06 They just want to replace him,
00:50:07 replace this character that has grown for 70 years.
00:50:10 All this character development,
00:50:12 they want to throw it in a fucking garbage can
00:50:14 so they can replace this character
00:50:16 literally with his younger self,
00:50:18 literally with a less-developed version of him,
00:50:20 so that they can have a new, like, weird status quo thing.
00:50:26 I hate it.
00:50:27 So that's four people on the Champions team.
00:50:30 Now you have to get to the girls.
00:50:32 You got Miss Marvel.
00:50:33 So, yeah, those are the four people that I hate.
00:50:36 Are we still talking about Champions?
00:50:38 It's been an hour.
00:50:39 Yeah, we're back to Champions.
00:50:40 I'm sorry, I apologize to America.
00:50:42 We had to talk about why Scott,
00:50:44 why bringing in Young Scott was terrible
00:50:46 and all the things that were connected to it.
00:50:48 Now we're back to Champions
00:50:50 and on to whether or not you hate Miss Marvel
00:50:52 and The Visions.
00:50:54 Yeah, so that's those guys.
00:50:56 Miles Morales, who is not interesting and I hate him.
00:50:58 Nova, who is not interesting and I hate him.
00:51:01 Amadeus Joe, who is not interesting and I hate them.
00:51:04 Young Scott Summers, who is the worst thing
00:51:06 ever created and I hate him.
00:51:08 And then there's Miss Marvel,
00:51:10 who I talked about last week.
00:51:11 Miss Marvel's an okay character.
00:51:13 I have no problem with her.
00:51:14 She's written poopily in this comic.
00:51:17 And then there's...
00:51:18 She's kind of a killjoy.
00:51:19 Yeah, she's being written as, like, the killjoy.
00:51:22 The mom.
00:51:23 They even address it.
00:51:24 They're like this fourth wall breaking.
00:51:25 Like, you're not gonna treat me like the woman
00:51:27 is always treated on these teams.
00:51:28 Like a buzz kill.
00:51:30 As she's being a buzz kill.
00:51:31 Yeah, literally as she's being a buzz kill.
00:51:33 So, like, Mark Wade,
00:51:35 because everyone that works at Marvel is a huge SJW,
00:51:38 he is aware of these storytelling tropes.
00:51:41 He's aware of what he's doing,
00:51:43 but he's too lazy to do something else.
00:51:45 So he thinks that if he addresses these stereotypes,
00:51:49 he can get away with doing them by addressing them
00:51:52 and seeming like he's self-aware about it.
00:51:55 Not that I have a problem with tropes.
00:51:57 I love tropes.
00:51:58 I have a problem with Marvel being cowardly about using tropes
00:52:01 and trying to fucking, like, fourth wall their way around it
00:52:04 and trying to be meta about it.
00:52:06 But anyways, and finally,
00:52:09 the final member of the champions,
00:52:13 Viv Vision.
00:52:15 My home girl.
00:52:17 Marvel did not waste any time ruining this character.
00:52:22 She was just invented,
00:52:24 and she's already ruined forever.
00:52:27 Um, Viv Vision, I talked about her.
00:52:30 I talked about the Vision in the last,
00:52:32 whatever the last edition is.
00:52:35 She is the Vision's daughter.
00:52:37 He made a little family for himself.
00:52:39 He made a daughter, and he had a series,
00:52:41 and it was like the best series,
00:52:42 the best comic in, like, five years.
00:52:44 It was really good.
00:52:45 Everyone loved it.
00:52:46 I'm still hurting over its conclusion.
00:52:48 Yeah.
00:52:49 And, you know, Viv goes through this character arc,
00:52:52 and at the end of it, you know,
00:52:53 she's kind of like this kind of sad,
00:52:56 kind of hurt, broken teen who's been through a lot of shit.
00:52:59 Oh, yeah.
00:53:00 I mean, if you want to know more about that,
00:53:02 read Vision.
00:53:03 Yeah.
00:53:04 We can't emphasize that enough.
00:53:05 Read Vision.
00:53:06 It's like, what, two volumes long?
00:53:08 It's not that long.
00:53:09 Just pick it up.
00:53:10 It's great.
00:53:11 So she's on this champions team,
00:53:13 and I see it, and I'm like, oh, cool.
00:53:14 This new character is being integrated
00:53:16 into the larger Marvel universe.
00:53:18 I'm okay.
00:53:19 I like her.
00:53:20 I'd like to read about her.
00:53:23 Issue two, the end.
00:53:26 You know...
00:53:27 Not even the end.
00:53:28 Before that, when...
00:53:30 Issue two is that all the champions
00:53:32 are trying to get to know each other,
00:53:33 and they're sitting around a campfire,
00:53:35 telling stories.
00:53:36 And I think Miss Marvel suggests,
00:53:38 let's tell ghost stories.
00:53:39 Yeah.
00:53:40 And there is this page that is one of...
00:53:43 The worst things I've ever seen in a comic.
00:53:46 Just like...
00:53:48 Viv goes...
00:53:50 In this weird alien,
00:53:53 star-fired,
00:53:54 Teen Titans Go voice
00:53:56 of not understanding humanity,
00:53:58 even though she was totally human before.
00:54:00 Yeah.
00:54:01 They're writing her as this weird robot archetype
00:54:04 who doesn't understand anything.
00:54:06 They want her to be the data of the team,
00:54:08 learning about humanity,
00:54:10 even though that's not who she is.
00:54:11 She, for all intents and purposes,
00:54:13 she's a human female girl.
00:54:14 She goes to a high school.
00:54:16 She's not like learning about humanity.
00:54:19 She's learning about the grievances of the human.
00:54:21 Yeah, but I mean like,
00:54:22 she's not that kind of character.
00:54:24 Yeah.
00:54:25 But they have her playing that role,
00:54:28 and Miss Marvel suggests telling ghost stories.
00:54:31 And Viv goes,
00:54:33 a ghost story.
00:54:35 A ghost is something that is alive,
00:54:38 but not really.
00:54:40 Like an android.
00:54:42 Is that...
00:54:44 a microaggression?
00:54:46 Oh my god!
00:54:48 No.
00:54:50 They...
00:54:52 They did it.
00:54:53 Marvel, your tumblr is showing.
00:54:54 They did it.
00:54:55 They fucking did it!
00:54:56 They put the word microaggression
00:54:58 into a comic,
00:54:59 and not only did they put the word
00:55:01 microaggression into a comic,
00:55:02 they put it in the mouth
00:55:04 of a character who had all the potential
00:55:06 to be interesting.
00:55:09 That we all liked and wanted to see more of.
00:55:12 Immediately ruined.
00:55:14 Immediately they've taken her,
00:55:15 and they've perverted her
00:55:17 into this weird Marvel tumblr bullshit.
00:55:20 It gets worse.
00:55:24 Oh no.
00:55:25 And then at the end of the book,
00:55:26 she...
00:55:27 The Hulk fucks her.
00:55:28 Yep.
00:55:29 You know,
00:55:30 when I saw that,
00:55:31 that last panel...
00:55:32 The last page of the book,
00:55:33 the last page of the book,
00:55:34 is Viv making out
00:55:36 with the fucking
00:55:38 teeny-bopper Asian Bro Hulk.
00:55:41 When I saw that,
00:55:42 all I could think was,
00:55:43 it must be like kissing a horse.
00:55:45 Oh.
00:55:46 Just, he's so massive.
00:55:49 How could they do this?
00:55:50 How could they do this to me?
00:55:51 How could they...
00:55:53 I don't like it.
00:55:54 Oh my god.
00:55:56 And you know, before that,
00:55:57 before that,
00:55:58 like all of that was led up to
00:56:00 her and Amadeus kissing,
00:56:01 making out.
00:56:03 You know, they're like,
00:56:04 they were, you know,
00:56:05 little teenage thing, you know,
00:56:06 you know,
00:56:07 you have your first kiss,
00:56:08 and she's like,
00:56:09 no, I haven't had my first kiss.
00:56:10 And like,
00:56:11 starts leaning in Nova's direction.
00:56:14 And then again,
00:56:15 it's Amadeus' show.
00:56:16 Like...
00:56:17 Just that fucking microaggression.
00:56:19 No, no, no.
00:56:20 I want to...
00:56:21 It makes my skin crawl.
00:56:22 All of it does.
00:56:23 It's all bad.
00:56:25 It shows the lack of self-awareness
00:56:28 on Marvel's behalf,
00:56:30 that they think
00:56:31 that a hyper-intelligent android
00:56:33 who understands,
00:56:34 who can have all information
00:56:36 in the world in her brain at once,
00:56:38 like a fucking genius,
00:56:41 that she would have this personality
00:56:44 of like,
00:56:45 don't microaggression me,
00:56:46 don't fucking,
00:56:47 ah, whiten me up, privilege.
00:56:49 You know,
00:56:50 but they think that is like enlightenment.
00:56:53 They truly do.
00:56:54 They think that that's how,
00:56:55 like, a hyper-intelligent android would speak.
00:56:58 Don't microaggression me.
00:57:01 You know, champions have the potential
00:57:03 to be really good.
00:57:04 The first issue
00:57:05 was actually really good
00:57:07 by itself,
00:57:08 for what it is.
00:57:09 Like, compared to what we've been dealing with lately,
00:57:11 it was sunny,
00:57:12 it was upbeat,
00:57:13 it was positive,
00:57:14 and Marvel lately has not been any of those things.
00:57:17 It's been devastating and sad.
00:57:19 And inclusive.
00:57:20 Don't forget inclusive.
00:57:21 Oh, yeah.
00:57:22 Devastating, sad,
00:57:23 shitty,
00:57:24 miserable,
00:57:25 pathetic,
00:57:26 poorly written,
00:57:27 but inclusive.
00:57:29 They've sacrificed it all for inclusivity.
00:57:32 But there's,
00:57:33 like, you're right,
00:57:34 that second issue was really off-putting,
00:57:35 for whatever reasons.
00:57:36 It was revolting.
00:57:37 And like,
00:57:38 like, I imagine
00:57:40 that I am Tom King,
00:57:43 that I have written this story
00:57:46 that is being praised,
00:57:48 critically acclaimed,
00:57:49 as one of the best stories
00:57:51 ever told in the comics medium.
00:57:53 Some people are saying that.
00:57:55 That it's up there with,
00:57:56 you know, like,
00:57:57 like, Watchman,
00:57:58 or fucking Swamp Thing,
00:57:59 or Animal Man, or whatever.
00:58:00 What is?
00:58:01 The vision.
00:58:02 Oh, yeah.
00:58:03 Right, you're right.
00:58:04 Yeah.
00:58:05 And I imagine that I've written this piece of literature
00:58:07 that has touched people.
00:58:09 That is like,
00:58:10 that is like a,
00:58:11 um, a diamond in the rough.
00:58:13 And in the sea of shit,
00:58:14 that is like,
00:58:15 Marvel Comics,
00:58:17 that I've written this amazing story,
00:58:18 and I've created this character
00:58:20 who has so much potential,
00:58:22 and immediately,
00:58:24 they sticker in a book
00:58:25 and have her complaining
00:58:26 about microaggressions.
00:58:29 If I was,
00:58:30 if I was the guy who wrote the vision,
00:58:31 I would be at Marvel right now
00:58:33 throwing Molotovs.
00:58:35 I'd be losing my shit.
00:58:37 Gotta develop avalanche for Marvel.
00:58:40 Oh, God.
00:58:41 There was one thing
00:58:42 I liked about Champions.
00:58:43 I would be remiss
00:58:44 if I didn't mention
00:58:45 the one panel
00:58:46 that gave me a chuckle,
00:58:47 a sensible chuckle.
00:58:49 It was when they were asking,
00:58:51 when Viv mentions
00:58:53 that she emits Wi-Fi,
00:58:55 so they can use their phones.
00:58:56 And they say,
00:58:57 cool,
00:58:58 what's your Wi-Fi password?
00:59:00 And her answer is,
00:59:02 even an android can cry.
00:59:04 Which is right up there
00:59:05 in the upper right corner
00:59:06 of the panel cast background.
00:59:08 One of my favorite panels of all time.
00:59:10 Even an android can cry.
00:59:12 That was a nice,
00:59:13 cute little nod.
00:59:14 It gave me a sensible chuckle.
00:59:16 I read that and like,
00:59:17 hey, this comic's not bad.
00:59:18 The very next page!
00:59:19 She's whining about microaggressions
00:59:21 and making out with a fucking,
00:59:23 a weird Hulk guy
00:59:24 who's not the Hulk.
00:59:25 Sucking his big green dick.
00:59:29 Filling her,
00:59:30 her, her fuel canisters
00:59:32 with cum,
00:59:33 hulk cum.
00:59:36 Wonder if it's like,
00:59:37 bright green like the rest of them.
00:59:39 Ugh.
00:59:40 Anyways,
00:59:41 that's Champions.
00:59:42 It ruined my life,
00:59:43 and now it's ruined this podcast.
00:59:45 It's been one hour.
00:59:47 Hahaha.
00:59:53 Everything,
00:59:54 I spent so long praising
00:59:55 the vision comics
00:59:56 in the last panel cast,
00:59:57 all of it's ruined now.
00:59:58 They've blown it all up.
00:59:59 I'm like,
01:00:00 I'm like,
01:00:01 Charlton Heston.
01:00:02 Those maniacs.
01:00:03 Charlton Heston,
01:00:04 and there's a giant,
01:00:05 the Statue of Liberty
01:00:06 is a giant,
01:00:07 broken,
01:00:08 viv vision on the beach.
01:00:09 She's been mangled.
01:00:10 Her head is ripped off
01:00:11 and her arm is sticking out of the water.
01:00:13 And I'm just sitting there
01:00:14 on the beach.
01:00:15 You maniacs!
01:00:17 You blew it all up!
01:00:19 Damn you!
01:00:21 Damn you,
01:00:22 salt to hell!
01:00:26 I didn't like it.
01:00:27 I didn't care for Champions.
01:00:30 That's fair.
01:00:32 Eight out of ten.
01:00:33 Hahaha.
01:00:39 Anyways,
01:00:40 now we can finally
01:00:41 talk about the things
01:00:42 that happened this week.
01:00:43 This is,
01:00:44 this is the giant sized
01:00:45 panel cast.
01:00:46 This is the special
01:00:48 third episode anniversary edition.
01:00:50 It's got to be,
01:00:51 this is an 80 page panel cast.
01:00:53 It cost ten dollars.
01:00:58 So let's talk about this week.
01:01:00 You and I,
01:01:01 yesterday,
01:01:02 before we talk about the comics,
01:01:04 we saw
01:01:05 Doctor Strange,
01:01:06 the movie.
01:01:08 Because I've just been
01:01:10 unleashing this torrent
01:01:12 of sweat and rage
01:01:14 for an hour.
01:01:15 I'll let you talk first.
01:01:17 What did you think
01:01:18 of the Doctor Strange movie?
01:01:19 Starring
01:01:20 Benedict
01:01:22 Cumberbunch
01:01:24 The Scrotum Supreme.
01:01:27 That's his name.
01:01:29 He's a great actor.
01:01:31 It's not an insult.
01:01:32 That's what I call him.
01:01:34 I just want to say firsthand
01:01:35 that I don't find him attractive.
01:01:37 But,
01:01:38 but I tell that to the world.
01:01:40 He's a great actor.
01:01:42 He was perfect for this role.
01:01:43 Great casting choice.
01:01:44 No, he was perfect.
01:01:45 Like,
01:01:46 within
01:01:48 five minutes of watching the movie,
01:01:49 I didn't see Benedict Cumberbunch anymore.
01:01:51 Nope.
01:01:52 I just saw Stephen Strange.
01:01:53 Yep.
01:01:54 He totally,
01:01:55 it was,
01:01:56 just like when Robert Downey
01:01:57 stepped into that fucking...
01:01:58 He embraces it.
01:01:59 He owns it.
01:02:00 He is
01:02:01 Doctor Strange.
01:02:02 Yes.
01:02:03 It's the role he was born for.
01:02:04 I loved it.
01:02:05 Doctor Strange
01:02:06 is definitely up there
01:02:07 as far as my favorite Marvel movies go.
01:02:08 I put it up there
01:02:09 with Guardians of the Galaxy,
01:02:10 honestly.
01:02:11 Give me a top five.
01:02:12 Top five?
01:02:13 Not in any kind of
01:02:14 particular order,
01:02:15 but for sure,
01:02:16 Guardians.
01:02:17 Doctor Strange.
01:02:18 I did not care that much
01:02:19 for Ant-Man.
01:02:20 I guess I can skip that.
01:02:21 I still had fun
01:02:22 with the first Avengers movie.
01:02:23 I thought that was
01:02:24 really well done.
01:02:26 Winter Soldier was good.
01:02:29 Lower top five,
01:02:30 probably.
01:02:31 What am I even missing?
01:02:32 I'm going to...
01:02:33 Thor?
01:02:34 Thor was fun.
01:02:35 The first Thor was okay.
01:02:36 The first Thor was fun.
01:02:38 Does anybody even remember
01:02:39 the second Thor?
01:02:40 Honestly,
01:02:41 honest to God.
01:02:42 I remember Ragnarok.
01:02:43 I don't.
01:02:44 I watched it.
01:02:45 And I don't remember anything.
01:02:46 Let me give a...
01:02:47 Let me try to give
01:02:48 my top five here.
01:02:49 Yeah.
01:02:50 Descending from five.
01:02:52 X-Men Days of Future Past
01:02:54 was really good.
01:02:55 Yeah.
01:02:56 The Ending Alone
01:02:57 was one of the best things
01:02:58 ever in a movie
01:02:59 that I've ever seen.
01:03:00 How the ending is
01:03:01 totally retconned
01:03:02 in the third X-Men movie.
01:03:03 That was such a
01:03:04 fuck yeah moment.
01:03:05 Yep.
01:03:06 I'll remember that moment
01:03:07 in the theater
01:03:08 for the rest of my life.
01:03:10 Okay.
01:03:15 Are you...
01:03:17 Civil War?
01:03:18 Was it great?
01:03:20 Did you not like it?
01:03:22 I don't think
01:03:23 they should have called it
01:03:24 a Civil War movie.
01:03:25 No.
01:03:26 Number three,
01:03:27 The First Avengers.
01:03:31 The First Iron Man.
01:03:33 Yeah,
01:03:34 you know,
01:03:35 I forgot about that movie.
01:03:36 I love those.
01:03:37 And number one,
01:03:38 the greatest Marvel movie of all,
01:03:40 perhaps the greatest film
01:03:41 of all time,
01:03:42 Spider-Man 2.
01:03:44 Which one?
01:03:46 The real Spider-Man 2.
01:03:47 Oh no.
01:03:48 With Toby.
01:03:49 Oh no.
01:03:50 You don't like Spider-Man 2?
01:03:52 Spider-Man 2
01:03:53 is the citizen cane
01:03:54 of movies.
01:03:58 Thank you.
01:04:00 I...
01:04:01 What are you doing to me
01:04:02 right now?
01:04:03 What is this?
01:04:04 What is this?
01:04:05 This hesitation?
01:04:06 It's like you're about to tell me
01:04:07 Spider-Man 2 is on me or something.
01:04:09 That's the look on your face right now.
01:04:12 You're about to tell me
01:04:13 the kid isn't mine.
01:04:14 I don't remember anything
01:04:15 about Spider-Man 2.
01:04:16 I remember the horrors
01:04:18 of Spider-Man 3
01:04:19 and that is all I remember.
01:04:20 You look like
01:04:21 you're about to tell me
01:04:22 the secret of my black son.
01:04:24 What?
01:04:26 You're gonna...
01:04:28 You're gonna burst that bubble for me.
01:04:30 What happened in Spider-Man 2?
01:04:32 I remember the amazing Spider-Man 2.
01:04:34 Spider-Man 2 was Doc Ock.
01:04:35 Okay.
01:04:36 That fucking scene on the train?
01:04:39 The greatest scene
01:04:40 in the history of cinema.
01:04:41 It's like...
01:04:45 Dr. Alan Grant
01:04:46 seeing the Brontosaurus
01:04:47 for the first time.
01:04:49 It's that.
01:04:50 And it's like...
01:04:52 Captain Jack Sparrow
01:04:53 on his sinking little boat
01:04:55 stepping onto the dock
01:04:56 at the beginning of Pirate of the Caribbean
01:04:58 and then the subway scene
01:05:00 in Spider-Man 2.
01:05:02 When all of those fucking New Yorkers
01:05:04 they take his mask off.
01:05:07 I'm gonna start crying again.
01:05:08 And they say...
01:05:10 You know?
01:05:11 He's just a kid.
01:05:12 He's no older than my son.
01:05:13 And Dr. Ock is gonna start wrecking shit.
01:05:15 He's gonna beat the shit out of Spider-Man
01:05:17 and those fucking New Yorkers.
01:05:19 You know?
01:05:20 The real America shines through.
01:05:21 That's something that we need
01:05:23 right now in this divided country.
01:05:25 Okay?
01:05:26 With this fucking election
01:05:27 that we've just been through.
01:05:28 Okay?
01:05:29 Where we've gotten to the point
01:05:30 as a country
01:05:31 where we say that elections
01:05:33 are something we need to heal from.
01:05:35 How insane is that?
01:05:37 That the phrase
01:05:38 we have to heal from this
01:05:40 is said after a fucking election.
01:05:42 That's how broken this country is.
01:05:44 Okay?
01:05:45 We've got people
01:05:46 even after the election
01:05:47 crying.
01:05:49 People breaking down in tears
01:05:50 about Donald Trump.
01:05:52 People are so fucking sad right now.
01:05:54 The country is tearing itself apart.
01:05:56 This poisonous election
01:05:57 has ruined us as a people.
01:06:00 But I'm telling you
01:06:01 just sit down
01:06:02 and go watch Spider-Man 2 again
01:06:04 and you will feel the spirit,
01:06:05 the power of the real America
01:06:07 pumping through your veins,
01:06:09 marching through your body
01:06:10 like electric soldiers
01:06:12 filling you with power
01:06:13 all throughout your being.
01:06:14 Your essence will transcend.
01:06:16 You will become,
01:06:17 you will achieve broken brilliance
01:06:19 as you feel the power
01:06:20 and clap for the new day
01:06:22 of the real America.
01:06:24 As you fucking see those New Yorkers,
01:06:26 they come together.
01:06:28 They put aside all differences
01:06:30 and they say,
01:06:31 Dr. Octopus,
01:06:33 if you mess with one of us,
01:06:35 you gotta mess with all of us.
01:06:37 And then Spider-Man,
01:06:38 he fucking gets up.
01:06:39 He's not wearing his mask anymore.
01:06:41 The secret identity is gone.
01:06:42 Everybody has phones.
01:06:43 Everybody has cameras.
01:06:44 Nobody's even so much
01:06:45 as taking a picture.
01:06:47 These people will keep this secret
01:06:49 to their grave
01:06:50 because that's how much they care
01:06:52 about Spider-Man
01:06:53 and he's fucking holding,
01:06:55 he's holding the tray
01:06:57 with his arms.
01:06:59 Ahh!
01:07:01 Ahh!
01:07:05 Ahh!
01:07:09 It's the greatest film ever made.
01:07:11 How dare you
01:07:12 not sing the praises
01:07:14 every day, every morning.
01:07:16 You should wake up
01:07:17 the first thing you should do
01:07:19 five times a day.
01:07:20 You should get on your hands and knees
01:07:21 and face towards Mecca
01:07:22 and praise Spider-Man 2.
01:07:26 I guess I'll rewatch it at some point.
01:07:30 I don't really remember.
01:07:31 What were we talking about?
01:07:32 The Doctor Strange movie.
01:07:33 Yeah, we were talking about
01:07:34 how great Doctor Strange is.
01:07:35 Oh yeah, I was supposed to put
01:07:36 Doctor Strange somewhere
01:07:37 in that top five.
01:07:38 Oh, somewhere.
01:07:39 Okay, top seven because,
01:07:40 okay, Doctor Strange
01:07:41 and Guardians,
01:07:42 I'll also put them in the top seven
01:07:43 Marvel movies.
01:07:44 There you go.
01:07:45 There you go.
01:07:46 Yeah, no.
01:07:47 Spider-Man 2 is number one, though.
01:07:48 I really enjoy Doctor Strange.
01:07:50 Just everything about it.
01:07:51 It was fun.
01:07:52 Like, he really owned the character
01:07:54 like we mentioned earlier.
01:07:55 The effects,
01:07:56 like the special effects were lone.
01:07:59 I don't know.
01:08:00 I really, it was,
01:08:01 everyone's like,
01:08:02 oh, it's the Marvel's inception,
01:08:04 but I thought it was better.
01:08:05 It really looked like
01:08:06 those old comic book covers
01:08:07 from like Jack Kirby.
01:08:08 Yeah.
01:08:09 Like, you know,
01:08:10 all the fucking colors
01:08:11 and the weird shit
01:08:12 in the dark dimension.
01:08:13 Like just the fucking scene.
01:08:14 The old foil covers.
01:08:15 Oh, God, yes.
01:08:16 It looked like a special edition,
01:08:18 like 90s foil cover
01:08:20 that glimmers in the light.
01:08:22 That fucking scene
01:08:23 where the ancient one first
01:08:24 throws him out of his body
01:08:25 and it's like this 10-minute scene
01:08:27 of him just like
01:08:28 having this total mental mind fuck
01:08:30 and like seeing all the
01:08:31 the wonders and horrors
01:08:32 of the infinite cosmos.
01:08:33 And that was so cool.
01:08:35 It was a good movie.
01:08:36 It really was.
01:08:37 I can't praise it enough.
01:08:39 All the casting was great.
01:08:40 The ancient one was awesome.
01:08:44 I think this might,
01:08:46 people might have complained
01:08:47 about her being a woman,
01:08:48 but I think that was
01:08:49 probably blown out of proportion.
01:08:50 They actually complained
01:08:51 specifically about her
01:08:52 being a white woman.
01:08:53 That's right.
01:08:54 That's right.
01:08:55 It wasn't that she was a woman.
01:08:56 It was that she was white.
01:08:58 Even though she's a great fucking actress.
01:09:00 She was so good.
01:09:01 Like,
01:09:02 I don't know.
01:09:04 I believed it.
01:09:05 I couldn't,
01:09:06 I don't know if I would have wanted
01:09:07 like another,
01:09:08 a different kind of ancient one
01:09:09 because how many times
01:09:10 have we seen that archetype
01:09:11 of an old ancient wise
01:09:13 like Tibetan guru
01:09:14 or Chinese guru
01:09:15 with like a big,
01:09:16 with a fucking Paimei beard
01:09:17 and a fucking,
01:09:18 you know,
01:09:19 we've already seen that
01:09:20 in every movie ever made.
01:09:21 It was a brilliant casting choice
01:09:22 to make the ancient one a woman
01:09:24 and a cool woman,
01:09:26 a hot babe.
01:09:27 She was awesome.
01:09:28 She was charismatic.
01:09:29 She felt like she,
01:09:31 you know,
01:09:32 she embodied that,
01:09:34 that simultaneous ferocity
01:09:36 and compassion.
01:09:38 She was good.
01:09:39 She was a nice thing.
01:09:41 A lot of the supporting cast
01:09:43 is really good.
01:09:44 I feel like the antagonists
01:09:46 were a little bit forgettable, but...
01:09:48 I like what they did
01:09:49 with Baron Mordo
01:09:50 because in the comics
01:09:52 and also like,
01:09:53 I mean, like,
01:09:54 I have an old, like,
01:09:55 from like 2007,
01:09:56 like this Marvel animated
01:09:57 Doctor Strange movie
01:09:58 that was really kind of boring
01:10:00 and not very good,
01:10:01 but I watched it like 10 times
01:10:02 that, you know,
01:10:03 same basic plot.
01:10:04 It's Doctor Strange.
01:10:05 He learns his powers.
01:10:06 He fights Dormammu or whatever.
01:10:08 You know,
01:10:09 in the original Doctor Strange origin,
01:10:11 Baron Mordo was like the Anakin.
01:10:14 He was power hungry
01:10:16 and it corrupted him
01:10:17 and he like tried to kill
01:10:18 the ancient one
01:10:19 and that's why he became a villain.
01:10:20 And this movie did something
01:10:21 like a little bit more unique
01:10:22 and a little bit more clever with it.
01:10:23 We're like,
01:10:24 instead of being like
01:10:25 a power hungry bad influence,
01:10:27 Baron Mordo was kind of like
01:10:29 the moral rules not see a little bit
01:10:33 and he was upset
01:10:34 with like the ancient one
01:10:35 breaking the rules
01:10:36 and it was his sort of devotion
01:10:39 to the cause
01:10:40 and his,
01:10:41 it was his strong moral sense
01:10:43 that caused him to become a villain
01:10:44 by the end.
01:10:45 Yeah.
01:10:46 Instead of like any kind of like
01:10:47 typical overdone, greedy,
01:10:49 I just want to be,
01:10:50 that was like the Caestilian role.
01:10:52 Or like in Ant-Man.
01:10:53 Yeah.
01:10:54 Like with the wasp.
01:10:55 Oh, Ant-Man was a good one too.
01:10:56 Top eight Marvel movies.
01:10:57 Ant-Man is on there.
01:10:58 You didn't like Ant-Man?
01:10:59 I was,
01:11:00 it was not blown away by it.
01:11:02 Well,
01:11:03 get out of my house.
01:11:04 I just felt like Paul Rudd
01:11:07 was a very Paul Ruddy in it.
01:11:09 Very watered down
01:11:11 compared to what I'm used to seeing out of him.
01:11:13 But anyway,
01:11:15 I don't know,
01:11:16 I really like Doctor Strange.
01:11:17 I really like the supporting cast.
01:11:18 Rachel McAdams who,
01:11:20 if you're not familiar,
01:11:21 she was the main antagonist
01:11:23 in Mean Girls
01:11:24 and now she is the
01:11:25 straight shooter, I guess,
01:11:27 that kind of part,
01:11:28 that just kind of helps
01:11:29 Doctor Strange out along the way.
01:11:32 Oh, Wong was great.
01:11:33 I loved Wong.
01:11:34 Wong was the best.
01:11:35 He was awesome.
01:11:36 Oh yeah.
01:11:37 Papa Wong.
01:11:38 It did a really good job of
01:11:40 I guess making me give a shit
01:11:42 about Doctor Strange.
01:11:43 Because I've always felt like
01:11:45 Doctor Strange in the comics
01:11:47 is a character that sort of
01:11:48 only works as a supporting character.
01:11:50 Like he'll show up in like a
01:11:51 Gwen pool
01:11:52 or in someone else's comic
01:11:53 and do some mystical stuff.
01:11:54 Or like in the original Civil War
01:11:56 he just kind of shows up
01:11:57 and he's like fixed.
01:11:58 Yeah, because his powers
01:11:59 are so like beyond the scope
01:12:00 of what people can grasp.
01:12:02 Like there's no rules to them.
01:12:03 So like...
01:12:04 If he was always on a team,
01:12:05 like everything would always be fine.
01:12:07 Like I feel like
01:12:08 reading Doctor Strange comics
01:12:09 or trying to,
01:12:10 I always feel like
01:12:11 what the hell is going on?
01:12:12 Like how can I get invested
01:12:13 in a story with no rules?
01:12:15 Maybe I'm wrong.
01:12:16 Maybe I haven't read enough
01:12:17 of the character.
01:12:18 But he's always been
01:12:19 like one of those
01:12:20 that's been a little difficult
01:12:21 for me to care about
01:12:23 or to grasp.
01:12:24 And they did a really good job
01:12:25 in this movie of making him
01:12:26 understandable.
01:12:27 And this is who he is
01:12:29 and what he does.
01:12:30 And there he goes.
01:12:31 Yeah, I'm really glad that they did
01:12:32 like all of the origins
01:12:33 and like the traumas
01:12:34 of what he went through
01:12:35 as a neurosurgeon.
01:12:36 Yeah.
01:12:37 It was really good.
01:12:38 And of course,
01:12:39 spoiler alert,
01:12:41 the actual,
01:12:43 not villain,
01:12:44 like just the
01:12:45 the cosmic force
01:12:46 in which the antagonists
01:12:47 were trying to get a hold of.
01:12:48 I was very excited about
01:12:50 Oh, Dormammu.
01:12:51 Oh my God.
01:12:52 Yes.
01:12:53 Yeah.
01:12:54 I was,
01:12:55 I was shaking in my chair.
01:12:56 I was like, yes, I need this.
01:12:57 How did you feel about
01:12:58 the look of Dormammu?
01:13:01 I had no problem with it.
01:13:02 I feel like it was fine.
01:13:04 Like the way that they portrayed
01:13:05 him in the movie
01:13:06 is suiting to the movie
01:13:07 and its theme
01:13:08 and what they were going for.
01:13:09 If they had just done
01:13:10 the actual Dormammu,
01:13:12 like design him
01:13:13 and his like
01:13:14 the guy with the scary head.
01:13:15 Yeah.
01:13:16 Like I feel,
01:13:17 I feel like that would have been
01:13:18 very thematic.
01:13:19 I don't like,
01:13:20 I don't think it's thematic.
01:13:21 I get what they were going for.
01:13:22 Like I,
01:13:23 like if he's in the dark dimension,
01:13:25 of course that he would be
01:13:26 like some giant,
01:13:27 eldritch fucking face
01:13:28 in the clouds, man.
01:13:29 But it just,
01:13:30 it kind of gave me
01:13:31 vibes of like,
01:13:33 of the,
01:13:34 the cloud Galactus
01:13:35 in the second
01:13:36 Fantastic Four movie
01:13:37 or like,
01:13:38 or like in Green Lantern.
01:13:40 Oh yeah.
01:13:42 Parallax was just like
01:13:43 It was a big ol' angry cloud too.
01:13:45 Yeah.
01:13:46 But they did it better.
01:13:47 It was definitely
01:13:48 better done
01:13:49 than in the Fantastic Four movie.
01:13:51 Because in that movie is,
01:13:52 that was like
01:13:53 in the early days
01:13:54 of the Marvel movies were like,
01:13:55 they didn't want to be
01:13:56 too comic booky
01:13:57 or too hokey.
01:13:58 They wanted to put
01:13:59 like the X-Men
01:14:00 and weird leather
01:14:01 costumes,
01:14:02 which now look
01:14:03 way more dated
01:14:04 than the superhero
01:14:05 costumes could ever look.
01:14:06 But um,
01:14:07 yeah like,
01:14:08 they can't have Galactus
01:14:09 be a big purple guy
01:14:10 with a helmet.
01:14:11 He has to be
01:14:12 a faceless cloud of
01:14:14 bullshit.
01:14:15 Like a total,
01:14:16 a maelstrom.
01:14:17 Yeah.
01:14:18 Um.
01:14:19 Anyways,
01:14:20 it was a minor thing that I was like,
01:14:21 well,
01:14:22 I wish he was a guy with a scary head.
01:14:23 But it didn't bother me that much.
01:14:24 It was a great movie.
01:14:25 No,
01:14:26 I'm glad that it wasn't.
01:14:27 Anyway.
01:14:28 And I really liked the ending.
01:14:29 Um,
01:14:30 and there are two
01:14:31 ending credit
01:14:32 or after
01:14:33 Oh yeah.
01:14:34 Oh man,
01:14:35 the first one,
01:14:36 the first after
01:14:37 credits was so cool.
01:14:38 I am really excited
01:14:39 for the new Thor movie.
01:14:40 Yeah,
01:14:41 please,
01:14:42 please.
01:14:43 No,
01:14:44 we were standing outside the theater.
01:14:45 You were,
01:14:46 you mentioned that you said like the
01:14:47 second Thor movie was pretty
01:14:48 forgettable.
01:14:49 And I was about to say like,
01:14:50 no,
01:14:51 it's not.
01:14:52 Remember that hat?
01:14:53 Uh,
01:14:54 well,
01:14:55 what about the part where
01:14:56 the,
01:14:57 the doctor,
01:14:58 the doctor was in it.
01:14:59 He was an elf.
01:15:00 It was Malaketh.
01:15:01 He did.
01:15:02 Natalie Portman
01:15:03 did something.
01:15:04 Two broke girls.
01:15:05 Um,
01:15:06 shit.
01:15:07 Yeah.

01:15:40 Sorry.
01:15:41 You saying all this
01:15:42 reminded me.
01:15:43 I had a customer once who,
01:15:44 I had an employee.
01:15:45 She was black.
01:15:46 She was the only black
01:15:47 girl in the company.
01:15:48 And I had a customer who
01:15:49 was a little bit mentally
01:15:50 unstable and he came in
01:15:51 and would hit on her and
01:15:52 he was like,
01:15:53 Oh no.
01:15:54 He's like,
01:15:55 I had a vision.
01:15:56 Oh no.
01:15:57 That.
01:15:58 I had a
01:15:59 Premonition.
01:16:00 He's like,
01:16:01 I had a vision that
01:16:02 my father Odin was
01:16:03 going to give me the power
01:16:04 to free all the blacks.
01:16:05 Whoa.
01:16:06 I need a movie.
01:16:07 I want a movie about the
01:16:09 mentally deranged comic
01:16:10 book fan who
01:16:11 frees all the blacks.
01:16:13 Well,
01:16:14 technically there is a
01:16:15 manga that you can read
01:16:16 called In a Yashiki.
01:16:17 That is about
01:16:18 an old man.
01:16:19 I ain't reading,
01:16:20 I ain't reading no
01:16:21 nip shit.
01:16:22 I ain't reading no
01:16:23 backwards ass black and
01:16:24 white fake comics
01:16:25 from a fake land
01:16:26 of fake people.
01:16:27 And
01:16:28 Digibro would like
01:16:29 it.
01:16:30 He probably
01:16:31 like In a Yashiki.
01:16:32 Digibro is being
01:16:33 converted.
01:16:34 Digibro loves American
01:16:35 excellence.
01:16:36 That's good.
01:16:38 That's horrifying
01:16:39 and good all at the same
01:16:40 time.
01:16:41 Did you see Luke Cage?
01:16:42 I have not seen
01:16:43 Luke Cage yet.
01:16:44 I did see Daredevil.
01:16:45 I did not care for the
01:16:46 second season of Daredevil
01:16:47 at all.
01:16:48 Neither did I.
01:16:49 I cared about
01:16:50 the first half of
01:16:51 the second season of
01:16:52 Daredevil.
01:16:53 And then it just goes
01:16:54 into this downward
01:16:55 spiral.
01:16:56 It went into this
01:16:57 like electrical hole.
01:16:58 What did they
01:16:59 fucking do to
01:17:00 Punisher?
01:17:01 Oh my God.
01:17:02 He didn't do anything
01:17:03 in the last episode.
01:17:04 The whole season
01:17:05 is about like
01:17:06 Daredevil vs. Punisher.
01:17:07 This amazing
01:17:08 philosophical budding of
01:17:09 heads between these
01:17:10 two diametrically opposed
01:17:11 brilliant characters
01:17:12 who are have so much
01:17:13 pathos and
01:17:14 characterization to them.
01:17:15 This whole season
01:17:16 is about these two
01:17:17 characters budding heads.
01:17:18 And it's the greatest
01:17:19 thing ever.
01:17:20 And they jumped the gun
01:17:21 at the hands shit.
01:17:22 They introduced it too
01:17:23 early.
01:17:24 And they just
01:17:25 the whole thing
01:17:26 went down into this fucking
01:17:27 ninja hole.
01:17:28 And fucking
01:17:29 I don't I didn't
01:17:30 like the actress
01:17:31 who played
01:17:32 Electra at all.
01:17:33 I don't like the accent.
01:17:34 Why can't they just
01:17:35 have them talk normal?
01:17:36 Why do they
01:17:37 cast these fucking
01:17:38 charisma vacuum women
01:17:39 as these fucking
01:17:40 characters?
01:17:41 They want everyone
01:17:42 to care about these
01:17:43 female superheroes.
01:17:44 They want representation.
01:17:45 They want little girls
01:17:46 to love Wonder Woman
01:17:47 and love Electra.
01:17:48 So why don't
01:17:49 they cast people
01:17:50 with charisma?
01:17:51 Why do they
01:17:52 cast these girls
01:17:53 with these like
01:17:54 weird accents
01:17:55 that sound ridiculous?
01:17:56 They don't want to talk.
01:17:57 They talk like
01:17:58 that fucking anime snob.
01:17:59 Fucking
01:18:00 I want to see the Wonder
01:18:01 Woman movie.
01:18:02 She's wrong about
01:18:03 sort of online
01:18:04 and he doesn't understand
01:18:05 he's a bad guy.
01:18:06 I am a 35 year old bald
01:18:08 man.
01:18:09 Wonder Woman is going to
01:18:10 be a 35 year old bald man
01:18:11 who reviews anime
01:18:12 badly on the internet
01:18:13 because she has a
01:18:14 stupid fucking accent
01:18:15 because they cast these
01:18:16 fucking emotionless
01:18:18 charisma devoid
01:18:19 broads as these characters.
01:18:21 Electra sucked.
01:18:22 Wonder Woman is going to
01:18:23 suck.
01:18:24 She already sucked
01:18:25 in the Batman v Superman
01:18:26 movie.
01:18:27 Electra sucked in
01:18:28 Daredevil season two
01:18:29 and they focused way too
01:18:30 much on her at the end.
01:18:31 She's boring
01:18:32 like this queer love story
01:18:33 between her and Matt Murdock
01:18:34 that nobody fucking
01:18:35 cares about.
01:18:36 Electra serves one
01:18:37 purpose.
01:18:38 The character of
01:18:39 Electra is only there
01:18:40 to die.
01:18:41 That she's not
01:18:42 interesting.
01:18:43 She's not cool.
01:18:44 I hate her.
01:18:45 She should just fucking
01:18:46 die and come back evil
01:18:47 and then die again
01:18:48 and get it over with.
01:18:49 I don't want to hear about
01:18:50 her.
01:18:51 I don't want to see her
01:18:52 falling in love with Matt Murdock.
01:18:53 I don't want to fucking
01:18:54 that weird scene
01:18:55 in the last episode
01:18:56 where there was like
01:18:57 100 hand ninjas
01:18:58 just patiently waiting
01:18:59 outside the door
01:19:00 to finish his
01:19:01 20 minute fucking
01:19:02 I'm in love with you monologue
01:19:03 locked in this broom closet
01:19:04 before they go out and fight.
01:19:06 The ninjas were just
01:19:07 waiting there.
01:19:08 They were just fucking
01:19:09 standing there.
01:19:10 Are you done?
01:19:11 Are you done falling in love
01:19:12 yet?
01:19:13 Are you done having
01:19:14 your big emotional fucking
01:19:15 the notebook scene?
01:19:16 Can we fight now please?
01:19:17 And then they have this
01:19:18 fucking tepid fucking
01:19:19 this this this soft
01:19:20 fucking penis
01:19:21 soft penis battle
01:19:22 on the on the on the
01:19:23 rooftop.
01:19:24 The Punisher shows up
01:19:25 and shoots like one bullet
01:19:26 and then fucks off
01:19:27 and does nothing.
01:19:28 They fucking
01:19:29 stuff.
01:19:30 Yeah.
01:19:31 They goofy like
01:19:32 yeah.
01:19:33 That thumbs up.
01:19:34 Oh man.
01:19:35 They they screwed the pooch
01:19:36 on that one.
01:19:37 Daredevil season two
01:19:38 started strong and ended
01:19:39 poop.
01:19:40 I'm like
01:19:41 traumatized right now.
01:19:42 Anyways.
01:19:43 Oh my god.
01:19:44 Luke Cage on the other hand.
01:19:46 Yeah.
01:19:47 How is that?
01:19:48 I hear good things about it.
01:19:49 Well,
01:19:50 Daredevil started strong
01:19:52 and then sort of went
01:19:53 got a little bad
01:19:54 at the end.
01:19:55 I thought
01:19:56 Luke Cage
01:19:57 was consistently
01:19:58 okay.
01:19:59 mediocre
01:20:00 for the entire run.
01:20:01 I mean like
01:20:02 there were parts of it.
01:20:04 There were certain scenes
01:20:05 in Luke Cage
01:20:06 that I thought were some
01:20:07 of the coolest things
01:20:08 I've ever seen.
01:20:09 Some of the best scenes
01:20:10 ever.
01:20:11 There were like
01:20:12 moments where
01:20:13 it came close
01:20:14 to greatness.
01:20:15 But for the most part
01:20:16 I kind of
01:20:17 was spacing out
01:20:18 and I think
01:20:19 binging is an unhealthy
01:20:20 way to watch
01:20:21 those anyways because
01:20:22 you get bored by the
01:20:23 seventh episode.
01:20:24 No matter how good
01:20:25 a show is.
01:20:26 So that could be part
01:20:27 of it.
01:20:28 But it didn't.
01:20:29 There were some really
01:20:30 like the scene where
01:20:31 he's you know
01:20:32 wearing the bullet hole
01:20:33 hoodie and Method Man
01:20:34 writes that cool rap song
01:20:35 about the black power
01:20:36 and that
01:20:37 that part was awesome.
01:20:38 You know,
01:20:39 it's funny too
01:20:40 because there were a lot
01:20:41 of people complaining
01:20:42 online
01:20:43 that Luke Cage
01:20:44 was a little
01:20:45 too black.
01:20:46 No,
01:20:47 fuck that.
01:20:48 That's bullshit.
01:20:49 And you know,
01:20:50 I just want to sit there
01:20:51 and I just want to tell them
01:20:52 like,
01:20:53 do you even know
01:20:54 what Luke Cage is about?
01:20:55 Why would you say that?
01:20:56 Like enough.
01:20:57 I want him to be the blackest
01:20:58 niggest ass,
01:20:59 fucking
01:21:00 bufarest
01:21:01 jungle bunny,
01:21:03 fucking
01:21:04 tar baby.
01:21:06 What's another one?
01:21:09 This is Trump's America.
01:21:10 I can say these things now.
01:21:13 I want him to be
01:21:15 the niggest of all
01:21:16 possible nigs.
01:21:17 The big nigg.
01:21:19 Yeah.
01:21:20 I mean,
01:21:21 yeah, he was good.
01:21:22 The show was definitely
01:21:24 sufficiently black.
01:21:25 He could have even been blacker
01:21:26 and I would have been happier.
01:21:28 Yeah.
01:21:29 You can't fucking take the blackness
01:21:31 out of Luke Cage.
01:21:32 The whole point of the character
01:21:33 is being black.
01:21:34 Like,
01:21:35 that's...
01:21:36 They were like,
01:21:37 it's just not credible
01:21:38 the way he's acting.
01:21:39 He's not acting.
01:21:40 It seems a little
01:21:41 scary.
01:21:42 And I was like,
01:21:43 stop.
01:21:44 Stop talking.
01:21:45 Read the old comics.
01:21:46 If you're kind of shit
01:21:47 on Luke Cage
01:21:48 for how they're
01:21:49 presenting him now,
01:21:50 you're not going to like
01:21:51 the old comics.
01:21:52 Yeah.
01:21:53 The inclusivity thing
01:21:54 that I've complained about
01:21:55 and that everyone can play.
01:21:56 It's not just about,
01:21:57 oh, they're taking
01:21:58 white characters
01:21:59 and white men
01:22:00 and turning them into
01:22:01 girls or black
01:22:02 or minorities or whatever.
01:22:03 It's just that,
01:22:04 regardless of race,
01:22:05 let the character
01:22:06 be who the character is.
01:22:07 Yeah.
01:22:08 Like,
01:22:09 Luke Cage is,
01:22:10 he's a fucking,
01:22:11 he's a fucking
01:22:12 70s exploitation.
01:22:13 He's shaft.
01:22:14 That's who he is.
01:22:16 Yeah.
01:22:17 And that's who he should be.
01:22:18 Which anybody,
01:22:19 if you're not reading
01:22:20 the new Luke Cage comics,
01:22:21 I do recommend them.
01:22:22 They're fun.
01:22:23 They're only,
01:22:24 there's only going to be
01:22:25 four of them
01:22:26 and it's drawn by the same guy
01:22:27 who did Samurai Jack.
01:22:28 Like,
01:22:29 making Luke Cage less black
01:22:30 would be the same as
01:22:31 making Thor a woman.
01:22:32 It's equally retarded.
01:22:34 It was definitely,
01:22:35 there was a lot of good scenes.
01:22:36 The scene where fucking
01:22:37 Cotton Mouth gets beaten up
01:22:38 by the girl,
01:22:39 I don't want to spoil it too much,
01:22:40 but that scene was fantastic.
01:22:41 That was like,
01:22:42 had me gripped.
01:22:43 And the scene,
01:22:44 like right at the beginning,
01:22:45 where like he,
01:22:46 the guy holds him up
01:22:47 and tries to mug him
01:22:48 and he says,
01:22:49 you know, you see that
01:22:50 police across the street,
01:22:51 let me give you a history lesson
01:22:52 about why America is great.
01:22:53 I love that like,
01:22:54 the patriotism aspect
01:22:56 of his personality
01:22:57 was really cool.
01:22:58 He was like,
01:22:59 he's a great character
01:23:00 and I liked the actor.
01:23:01 There was one thing
01:23:02 that really bothered me
01:23:03 about Luke Cage.
01:23:04 The actor has a fucking mole
01:23:05 on the back of his head.
01:23:06 And I mean,
01:23:07 like he's bald
01:23:08 for the whole show.
01:23:09 He shaves his head,
01:23:10 but that fucking mole,
01:23:11 every time I see it,
01:23:12 it took me out of the show.
01:23:13 Like,
01:23:14 can he get that removed,
01:23:15 please?
01:23:16 If he's going to play
01:23:17 a beloved character,
01:23:18 if I'm going to have to watch
01:23:19 Luke Cage forever
01:23:20 for years and years,
01:23:21 and it looks weird,
01:23:22 like you can see it
01:23:23 from the front.
01:23:24 It's a mole
01:23:25 on the back of his head
01:23:26 and you can see it
01:23:27 from the front
01:23:28 because it sticks out weirdly.
01:23:29 And I'm just looking at it,
01:23:30 the whole show,
01:23:31 he's like,
01:23:32 I'm Luke Cage,
01:23:33 I'm really strong
01:23:34 and Black Lives Matter
01:23:35 and I'm going to beat
01:23:36 the bad guys
01:23:37 and I'm going to have a fight
01:23:38 and the whole,
01:23:39 I can't even fucking
01:23:40 focus on.
01:23:41 All I can focus
01:23:42 is that weird mole
01:23:43 on his head
01:23:44 and I just want to take it.
01:23:45 It's like Austin Powers.
01:23:46 I'm just looking at
01:23:47 Luke Cage,
01:23:48 the whole movie.
01:23:49 Mole,
01:23:51 we talked about Steven Strange,
01:23:52 we talked about Luke Cage,
01:23:53 we talked about Daredevil.
01:23:54 Now we can finally
01:23:55 talk about comics.
01:23:57 An hour and a half
01:23:58 into the panel cast,
01:23:59 we can talk about comics.
01:24:01 The new ones from this week?
01:24:02 Yeah, the new ones
01:24:03 from this week.
01:24:04 Oh no.
01:24:06 Oh no.
01:24:07 I know, I know.
01:24:08 You see it on my notes.
01:24:09 Yeah.
01:24:10 I mean,
01:24:12 so last week
01:24:13 wasn't really that great.
01:24:14 This week is equally
01:24:15 unimpressive.
01:24:17 And that's not to say
01:24:18 that comics are generally,
01:24:20 so they released
01:24:21 Spider-Man Renew Your Vowels
01:24:23 number one this week.
01:24:24 And I have been
01:24:25 so excited for this one
01:24:27 because I really like Mary Jean
01:24:29 as a superhero.
01:24:31 I like Mary Jean in general.
01:24:32 Yeah, she's interesting.
01:24:33 She's fun.
01:24:34 I think taking her out
01:24:35 of the Spider-Man mythos
01:24:36 was one of the worst things
01:24:37 they ever did.
01:24:38 No, like,
01:24:39 Mary Jean is fun.
01:24:40 She's great.
01:24:41 She's Peter Parker's fucking wife.
01:24:42 And she should be.
01:24:43 Yeah.
01:24:45 But Spider-Man Renew Your Vowels,
01:24:46 which was a title
01:24:47 that they released
01:24:49 during Secret Wars
01:24:51 as, like, just a few issues.
01:24:52 And now it is an ongoing series
01:24:54 starring Spider-Man,
01:24:55 Mary Jean, his wife,
01:24:57 and their daughter, Annie.
01:24:59 And I'm just going to say this
01:25:00 right now.
01:25:01 I do not give a fuck
01:25:02 about Annie.
01:25:03 I don't give a fuck
01:25:04 about anyone's daughter.
01:25:05 I don't want to see anyone's kids.
01:25:06 I hate kids.
01:25:07 I'm tired of,
01:25:08 like, it's a consistent thing
01:25:09 in Marvel.
01:25:10 All the kids in Marvel
01:25:12 are really fucking smart.
01:25:14 We get it.
01:25:15 Yeah.
01:25:16 We get it.
01:25:17 We get it.
01:25:18 We get it.
01:25:19 I mean,
01:25:20 she's sitting in her room
01:25:21 and she fucks up her dad's shit
01:25:22 because she's trying to make it
01:25:23 better and she's crying
01:25:24 and she's trying to make it better.
01:25:25 It's like, I get it.
01:25:26 Here's what I hear.
01:25:28 Here's how I feel about, like,
01:25:29 about kids sidekicks in general.
01:25:32 There should be one
01:25:33 and his name is Robin.
01:25:36 I like Damien.
01:25:37 I mean, all the Robins.
01:25:38 All the Robins.
01:25:39 Batman can always have a Robin.
01:25:40 Batman always should have a Robin.
01:25:41 Mm-hmm.
01:25:43 Nobody else,
01:25:44 no other superhero should have,
01:25:45 like, a younger sidekick.
01:25:46 It only works for Batman because I think like the character of Batman kind of needs a Robin
01:25:51 But um
01:25:53 You know, I hate kid flash. I hate Donna Troy. I hate fucking all the little teeny boppers. I hate them
01:25:59 They shouldn't exist
01:26:00 Fucking if you're if you're if your name isn't Robin, then you shouldn't be a fucking sidekick
01:26:04 You should be I hate them superheroes don't need little sidekicks
01:26:09 Robin is the sidekick
01:26:11 Yeah
01:26:12 Either way renew your vows like I was really looking forward to this one and it and how did you describe it insipid insipid?
01:26:20 Yes, yeah, that's I think that's a pretty good. I just felt nothing. It was yeah
01:26:25 Well, it did not leave an impact on me like I feel like it should have like the artwork was really good
01:26:30 I loved the chemistry between Peter Parker and Mary Jane, but anytime they brought in Annie
01:26:35 It just fucking ruined everything for me. I'm a little spider. I pooped in my web diaper
01:26:40 I have to have I have to wipe my butt. Watch me catch this this item in the most fucking
01:26:48 Graciously a elaborate way at the kitchen table. I get it. You're a fucking spider girl. I get it. You're a fucking genius
01:27:03 So you heard me talking about spider-man 2 and you and you heard in my voice
01:27:08 How much the character of spider-man means to me?
01:27:14 I'm gonna go here. I'm gonna I'm gonna go go for it. So about 10 years ago
01:27:22 Everything about spider-man was
01:27:26 irreparably ruined forever
01:27:30 They took it all they took everything that was good and pure about the character and they flushed it down the visitors crapper and
01:27:38 The character of Peter Parker to this day has not recovered. I think I feel like the entire Marvel universe
01:27:46 Has not recovered. I feel like this decision in a lot of ways
01:27:50 ruined the entire Marvel universe
01:27:53 There was this storyline 10 years ago called spider-man one more day
01:27:59 infamous
01:28:00 infamously hated for for good reason, but you know what?
01:28:05 No matter how much people hate one more day, they don't hate it enough
01:28:11 They don't god fucking so
01:28:16 Civil war
01:28:17 The original civil war a huge plot point was that spider-man revealed his secret identity. Yep
01:28:23 He joined Tony Stark side Tony Stark assured him that this would be the safe and right thing to do
01:28:29 Yep, and because he's spider-man it immediately backfired
01:28:32 Of course all of his enemies
01:28:34 Because like one of the great things about spider-man to me one of the great things
01:28:39 about the character of spider-man is
01:28:44 His greatest flaw, which is that he's a bully
01:28:48 Spider-man's supervillains hate him
01:28:52 They want him to suffer like
01:28:55 Fucking
01:28:57 Killer croc doesn't hate Batman. I mean he hates them because he foils his crimes
01:29:01 Yeah, Batman's just an inconvenience
01:29:03 But like on a personal level because spider-man doesn't just beat up his supervillains. He mocks them
01:29:08 He makes fun of them. He belittles them because spider-man was bullied as a teenager and
01:29:14 Like I feel like an un-talked-about aspect of his character is this big flaw of his that he's internalized it and
01:29:21 He's always projecting even trying to be responsible and trying to be a good guy
01:29:25 Spider-man is kind of a dick. He is a bully
01:29:29 He'd be you know and so his all of spider-man's villains doc-ock green goblin electro the shocker
01:29:36 They all have this personal fucking hatred of spider-man and they want to make himself for so much
01:29:41 So in that way, you know spider-man
01:29:45 He creates his own problems
01:29:48 Because he makes these these two-time criminals these would be
01:29:52 Nothing criminals he kind of elevates them to super criminals just because of how much he makes them hate him
01:29:58 Yeah, that's a really good example. Yeah black cat's a legitimate super. She was like a cat woman kind of a vigilante sort of a
01:30:05 On again off again girl things have definitely escalated and now she's like an evil kingpin type. Did you ever read superior spider-man?
01:30:12 Yes
01:30:15 Great
01:30:19 But that's kind of what I like about spider-man is that um, I think that what makes him
01:30:26 Possibly the best superhero or the best superhero character in his own way. I think every
01:30:31 Comic book character is the best comic book character in their own way
01:30:34 But um, I just like the fact that of all the superheroes
01:30:37 I think that spider-man has always been the most corruptible the most human he will always make mistakes
01:30:43 He will always be corrupted by his by power or like delusions of grandeur
01:30:46 He'll always have moments where he loses his temper and does something stupid and he'll always create bigger problems for himself
01:30:53 And that's kind of the character struggle and what makes him interesting to read about so
01:30:58 He he gets assured by Tony Stark that removing his mask and revealing his identity
01:31:03 Will be an okay thing but because he's spider-man and
01:31:07 Everyone fucking all of his supervillains hate him so much
01:31:11 immediately it backfires and everybody starts gunning for his family and
01:31:15 eventually like an assassin hired by Wilson Fisk shoots Aunt May and Aunt May is gonna die and
01:31:22 Because he has a guilt complex. He feels like it's his fault even though Aunt May is a thousand years old in any ways
01:31:27 He's gonna fucking croak any day now. You know, he's desperate. He goes to everyone. He goes to read Richard's
01:31:32 He goes to dr. Strange. He goes to even even supervillains like dr. Doom desperate
01:31:37 Please someone who's good at science or magic save my aunt aunt
01:31:43 How do you say aunt? I've always said aunt. I think I'd say aunt. I don't know you're from Texas. Yeah, I
01:31:50 Don't know it always trips me up. It swings. It does swing, you know, please
01:31:54 It depends on their personality somebody save my aunt. She can't die. It can't be my fault
01:31:58 I will be a sad panda if that happens. I think she's an aunt may for sure though. Yeah, but um
01:32:04 Everyone says no for whatever reason
01:32:06 Even though like, you know, Reed Richards could have cured cancer a billion times by now
01:32:11 I don't buy for a second that Reed Richards couldn't have cured a bullet hole in an old lady
01:32:16 I don't believe for one second that dr. Strange couldn't have solved it, but
01:32:23 Yeah, Magneto
01:32:25 But um, yeah, so everyone tells him no no one can
01:32:28 Solve this dilemma finally Mephisto. He goes to the demon lord Mephisto the devil of the Marvel universe
01:32:36 And he says you're my last hope. He signs a deal with the devil to basically
01:32:43 redo this and
01:32:46 So Mephisto uses his powers in exchange. He says, I don't want your soul. I want your love
01:32:50 I'm going to take your marriage and you're not married to Mary Jane anymore the weirdest excuse for a retcon ever
01:32:57 I mean the real reason they did this is because they they wanted they didn't want spider-man to be too grown up
01:33:02 The editor-in-chief at Marvel. He said this publicly
01:33:05 He wanted spider-man. He thinks that spider-man should be relatable to younger people and he should never be too grown up
01:33:10 He didn't want him to be married. He just wanted him to be like a poor struggling bachelor again
01:33:16 Which you know, which now if you look at the
01:33:20 Opposite yeah, I can't they've gone too far in the opposite direction now, but um
01:33:24 So he makes a deal with the devil to retcon all this horrible stuff that happened
01:33:29 And a lot of people dwell on that they do they dwell on the moral implications of it
01:33:33 Like spider-man would never make a deal with the devil. That's not my problem with it
01:33:38 That's because like I spider-man his whole thing is that he's a very corruptible. He makes mistakes
01:33:42 Of course spider-man would make a deal with the devil. That's who he is. I mean, has anybody seen the new spider-man Deadpool?
01:33:49 Yeah, I just go on. Yeah, sorry. I'll get that but um
01:33:55 Yeah, so I don't have a problem with that on like a moral level
01:33:58 Of course spider-man would make a deal with Mephisto. That seems totally in character for me, but
01:34:04 The problem that I have is the ripple effect of this
01:34:09 Retcon throughout all of spider-man continuity and all of Marvel continuity it ruined everything
01:34:16 Nothing for the last decade has made any sense because of this one moment in time
01:34:24 That was clever. You hear what I did there because there's another comic
01:34:27 Clap for me, baby because of this one story fucking
01:34:32 so I
01:34:33 Guess the continuity became that like he did unmask during civil war
01:34:38 But nobody remembered it for some reason and people were like aware that they didn't remember it
01:34:43 They just didn't care
01:34:44 like
01:34:46 Like he was not an Avenger anymore
01:34:48 No, none of the other superheroes even knew who he was which really grinds my gears because that like takes away character development
01:34:54 For so many like different characters and aspects like there was always this like weird budding friendship between him and Wolverine
01:35:00 That I always loved reading that was gone because nobody fucking knows that he's Peter Parker now
01:35:04 Nobody ruins everything this like this like weird bonding moment with Jessica Jones and that one issue were like
01:35:10 Hey, we went to high school together and I had a crush on you Peter in high school and Luke Cage is like nigga
01:35:15 What and that was a great moment that I don't know how that fits in anymore
01:35:19 It doesn't make cuz nobody knows he's Peter Parker
01:35:20 They got fucking comics now to this day
01:35:23 Nothing about the Marvel universe makes any sense because the ripple effect there's so many tiny little things
01:35:27 So many little stories that you now have to wonder did they even happen?
01:35:31 Did they do how do they fit in anymore because because nobody knowing his identity it ruins everything like um
01:35:38 Like in the new Avengers comic nobody trusts spider-man. They're like who's this weird spider-man guy?
01:35:43 We don't trust him. We don't know who he is. Everybody thinks that spider-man is like a weird guy
01:35:48 Even though he was an Avenger for like a decade. He everybody lived with them. They knew he was Peter Parker fucking Tony Stark
01:35:55 Meets Mary Jane and he goes. Oh, who are you? I don't know who Mary Jane Watson is Mary Jane lived in Stark Tower for like 10 years
01:36:04 Holy shit, but it doesn't make any sense
01:36:06 I read and it just blows my fucking mind like every fucking thing having to do with spider-man blows my mind
01:36:11 None of it makes any sense. Nobody. How does Tony Stark not know who Mary Jane is?
01:36:16 She lived at his house does she just not remember living at his house for 10 years
01:36:20 Does he does he not remember this does he remember like someone lived this you remember that like do they remember that like?
01:36:25 Yeah, spider-man was an Avenger, but maybe we didn't see his face and we didn't we never paid attention to that to his wife
01:36:30 And his aunt who lived here. What wife what aunt we don't know what?
01:36:35 Like even though spider-man has been like
01:36:38 Like it's back to this like weird old status quo of like none of the superheroes knowing if they can trust spider-man
01:36:45 Even though like he's been like an Avenger. He's been like the best superhero for years and years
01:36:51 X-Men he's been on the fantastic for future foundation. I'm sorry. Yeah, like spider-man
01:36:58 His tangled web is a part of everything spider-man is the lynchpin of the entire Marvel universe
01:37:05 Red conning that one thing about spider-man had ripple effects that ruined everything and made everything goofy like
01:37:11 Like spider-man's power his real power in like a meta sense
01:37:15 Not not that he can not that he's agile and can shoot webs
01:37:19 The real power of the character of spider-man his place in the Marvel universe is that in an unspoken sense
01:37:26 He is the best superhero that is the purpose of spider-man. He
01:37:32 He's been around all these years. He's the most fucking, you know
01:37:37 Resilient the most, you know the most tenacious
01:37:42 Every superhero he doesn't have the best powers
01:37:44 But every superhero secretly knows that a spider-man got pissed off enough. He would kill all of them spider-man
01:37:52 His place in the Marvel universe is that he's the best superhero
01:37:55 He could kick anyone's ass no matter how powerful they are fucking Thor Dormammu fucking
01:38:00 Anyone nobody can beat spider-man. That's his power as a narrative device. Do you agree?
01:38:07 Sure
01:38:09 Sure, do you understand what I'm saying though? Yeah, I do. I do. He's the most important superhero in the Marvel universe
01:38:15 Anyways, there's more spider. So because so because the one more day storyline ruined everything forever
01:38:20 It ruined spider-man comics forever it ruined the Marvel universe forever. Everyone hates it
01:38:25 Marvel kind of has to every once in a while. They released like a what if or a what if we didn't ruin spider-man
01:38:31 What if we weren't the most a comically inept comic book company literally comically inept company that ever existed
01:38:40 What if we actually appreciated and valued our characters and knew how to write them?
01:38:45 So every every couple of years we get like this alternate universe just to like just to tease us of like what if like he was still
01:38:51 Married to Mary Jane and what if the spider-man mythos still made sense?
01:38:55 Yeah, they did that after seeker invasion
01:38:58 Yeah, things like that. I know you're talking about. Yeah, so this is another like sort of Elseworlds kind of thing
01:39:04 Yeah, where it's like what if spider-man was Mary to Mary Jane and they had a daughter and she had spider-man powers too
01:39:13 What if that?
01:39:15 And like I don't see the point of it
01:39:17 I don't see the point of an out of continuity just to sort of like tease people who want this who want things to make sense
01:39:24 Again, it's kind of it to me. It's just kind of like just pouring salt on the wound
01:39:29 You know, I did kind of see it that way like at the tease. Yeah, um, but I mean
01:39:35 I don't know. There are things about renew your vows that I still enjoyed
01:39:40 But I think I already explicitly like yelled about them the chemistry between Mary Jane and spider-man are perfect
01:39:44 Annie ruins fucking everything as usual. She ruins it all the way up until the end ruins it literally
01:39:50 Ruins everything. I hate it. I hate her. Why is she in this?
01:39:53 Yes, and that's that's it. There's nothing really to say about it
01:39:57 I mean, it's just the first issue and it's just setting up the dumb bullshit
01:40:00 It's just gonna be like a fluffy meaningless out of continuity
01:40:04 Salt in the wound cluster fuck up. Ha ha ha wouldn't it be funny if spider-man still made sense, but he doesn't we'll never fucking fuck you
01:40:12 We'll never actually do this
01:40:14 Right, so it just kind of annoyed me greatly everything about spider-man sends me into a blind frothing fucking rage
01:40:20 The new spider-man in general has definitely been that way for me like have you been reading clone conspiracy like actually reading?
01:40:26 Yeah, that was next on my notes. I was gonna get to that, but I mean fuck spider-man is so weird now
01:40:31 They've taken him in such a weird direction. They've just made him into Tony Stark
01:40:34 Yeah, he's just a rich guy now. Like I liked Peter Parker
01:40:38 Spider-man who is so broke they had to run after the bus like stay on the back of the bus like yeah, I'm like
01:40:45 What is the point like wasn't the whole point of one more day the reason that you that you through this?
01:40:50 Wrenching to everything and ruin spider-man forever was so that you could have him like be a relatable guy
01:40:54 Yeah, supposedly, but like now they've gone the opposite way anyways, so now we have the worst of both worlds
01:41:00 He's not relatable and his continuity makes no fucking sense it so now he's like he's in charge of this billion-dollar corporation
01:41:08 He's just Tony Stark now. He's not even Peter Parker anymore Tony Stark isn't even Tony Stark isn't Tony Stark anymore and fucking
01:41:16 I've always hated I've always kind of disliked like genius Peter Parker where they kind of elevate it
01:41:22 Like I don't think that spider-man should be a genius
01:41:24 I don't think that he should be like Reed Richards Tony Stark level. It's okay for him to be like smart and sciency
01:41:29 That's part of his charm, but making him out to be like oh, I invented ten new spider suits and I invented in the top
01:41:35 Like he's in the top eight smart yeah, get that shit the fuck out of here. That's stupid. That's not what that's not why people like the character
01:41:41 No
01:41:42 He's charismatic. He's fun. He's relatable, but now he's just rich
01:41:47 Yeah, and like you can have him still be relatable and still be Peter Parker without taking away his fucking wife and all of his continuity
01:41:54 Like it's not his his his financial status that makes him relatable
01:41:59 It's not like his marital status that makes spider-man the most relatable superhero to a lot of people
01:42:04 It's his personality. It's the fact that he's a flawed kind of doofy dipshit who creates his own problems
01:42:10 And as always seems to have bad luck, right? And so they just don't understand it
01:42:15 I
01:42:16 People who write comics don't understand the characters only I do
01:42:19 I'm the only person who in any kind of a meta narrative sense understands
01:42:23 I should be writing every single fucking comic
01:42:26 I keep saying that and it keeps getting more true with every comic I read everyone who writes comics is incompetent
01:42:31 I'm the only one who understands shit about fuck
01:42:34 I'm having a vein is gonna pop in my fucking forehead any minute now
01:42:40 So spider-man is like a rich like industrialist fucking
01:42:44 Lex Luthor type basically almost and he has these comics where like the Avengers go. Oh, Peter Peter Parker is
01:42:52 Funding the Avengers now and and we he's like an outsider
01:42:55 Even though he lived with us and we knew he was Peter Parker for 10 years
01:42:59 He's like an outsider and we don't know if we can trust spider-man and also Peter Parker is
01:43:04 Friends with spider-man and we all just buy that for some reason all the superheroes who really should be savvy to this
01:43:11 Because Tony Stark did it for like 60 years this iron man's my bodyguard shit, but somehow they totally fall for it again
01:43:17 Oh, yeah, Peter Parker's just this weird guy and spider-man is like his bodyguard
01:43:21 I guess I guess they're like friends like how fucking dumb how much of a bunch of fucking dipshits are these superheroes now
01:43:27 I have an appreciation for Tony Stark in the movies who's like, yeah, my man fuck it. What of it?
01:43:32 That was brilliant that's like
01:43:35 Don't beat around the bush like I get it like I'm trying and that's totally
01:43:39 That's like this moment of like this aspect of the character that is so right
01:43:43 But like the comics never figured out until the movie like once you see it in the movie like yeah, of course Tony Stark wouldn't keep it
01:43:49 a secret why would he it's just yeah like
01:43:53 Peter Parker being like a rich industrialist and like spider-man being his friend
01:43:58 Nobody's ever gonna buy it. It makes no sense. It doesn't make sense for the character or for the continuity
01:44:02 I hate it. I you know
01:44:04 I was really sad when superior spider-man ended like I knew eventually it would have to because Doc Ock can't be spider-man forever
01:44:10 But it was still
01:44:12 Devastating for him to go from you know that to well now
01:44:17 I'm going to get all of Doc Ock's like riches and his company and it's gonna grow from there in the wow
01:44:24 I'm gonna be great and it's just it's not just this fucking
01:44:27 It takes me out of it
01:44:29 Just the fact that like all of these new Avengers comics that came out like when I was in middle school and high school
01:44:34 Where they relaunched the Avengers and it was like spider-man and Wolverine and spider-woman and Luke Cage
01:44:39 And that that was like the best lineup ever
01:44:41 It was all these cool characters and they live together and start tower and they were like friends
01:44:46 They would like have scenes of them like eating takeout Chinese takeout like with their masks off and like there were scenes like that
01:44:50 Jessica Jones see and I mentioned were like we went to high school together Peter
01:44:53 Wow, you were a spider-man all along like all these great little character building moments like and all like ten years of like continuity of like
01:44:59 The new Avengers becoming friends and like all of that because of the the one more day story was like wiped away
01:45:05 Now the Avengers like don't know who spider-man even is they don't trust him again
01:45:09 It's back to this like weird paradigm of spider-man being the outsider and being this like weird guy who isn't even
01:45:14 recognizable from a character standpoint as the spider-man I know anymore and
01:45:18 like
01:45:20 I'm all for character development, but just like
01:45:24 Taking it in like the weird direction too far too fast is not character development
01:45:28 It's just like a goofy it freaks me out and the one more day thing and it ruined everything forever. I'm just repeating myself
01:45:34 I'm going into a fucking loop. I'm in a loop of madness a loop of sadness because you know there was this you know
01:45:41 Fuck one of my favorite stories of all time
01:45:44 Astonishing spider-man and Wolverine where spider-man and Wolverine they go on this fucking time travel adventure and they become like best friends
01:45:52 By the end of it
01:45:53 It's like this tremendous spider-man meets this girl in like the old Wild West and they lived there for like three years and he gets married and then
01:45:59 you know and
01:46:01 He goes back to the present and she doesn't remember and and so like he's lost this love of his life
01:46:06 And the only person he who knows about this like side of spider-man now is Wolverine and they have this like bonding friendship now
01:46:12 That's gone because Wolverine doesn't know that he's Peter Parker anymore. Did that like not happen now?
01:46:17 Nobody remembers anything about spider-man or all this character development that happened in the 2000s. It's all gone
01:46:26 God why why did they ruin everything? Oh
01:46:32 God oh
01:46:33 Boy
01:46:35 Are you ready to move on to the next spider-man topic? Yeah, and after I get done with mine
01:46:40 You had comics that you read that you wanted to talk about too. He's crazy. This is truly giant-sized people
01:46:44 How long are we into this already? Well, I this is the only one left to have after I'm gonna talk about this next one
01:46:50 At some point I'm gonna get Digi on here and me and him are gonna talk about Gwenpool because he's been getting it
01:46:55 Okay, um
01:46:56 Okay, so the last thing on my list for this week is another spider-man. So I you get to listen to me rage about spider-man more
01:47:05 Um spider-man the clone conspiracy issue number two, I believe um
01:47:12 This has been okay. I'm I don't hate this. I don't hate this now granted
01:47:19 It's still like the you know the modern industrialist genius Tony Stark spider-man that I have trouble caring about it all anymore, but
01:47:28 This is a storyline that is
01:47:30 Steeped in some of the weirder aspects of continuity
01:47:34 I'm just like a continuity nerd. That's I think that's why I hate one more day so much because I
01:47:39 Am a fan of it. I get off on these weird stories. That's what I love about Grant Morrison
01:47:44 he's one of my favorite writers of all time because
01:47:47 When Grant Morrison writes a character he fucking reads everything about them that's ever been written and he like pulls things from like the
01:47:54 50s and the 70s and the 30s and he like reintegrates them. Did you ever read Grant Morrison's Batman?
01:48:00 Amazing what he did how he took all these like different incarnations of Batman and made them cohesive into a picture that made sense as
01:48:07 Like one complete character brilliant
01:48:09 I should talk about that because it makes me happy and spider-man doesn't but I'm gonna talk about spider-man. I
01:48:14 Like continuity and this clone conspiracy storyline is a story that is sort of steeped in like
01:48:21 Weird continuity it all stems from this storyline in the early 90s this infamous
01:48:29 storyline
01:48:30 Called the clone saga and it's this it's a storyline that is
01:48:36 Sort of has become synonymous in people's minds with this like bloated
01:48:42 Overdrawn attitude of how comics are being written in the early 90s that sort of caused like the whole market to crash
01:48:50 The clone saga of spider-man is what people point to because it was this long
01:48:55 Super convoluted storyline that went for like five years and it was all about spider-man
01:49:00 Just getting cloned a million times and he didn't know if he was the real spider-man
01:49:04 And there was a sky called Ben Riley who was a clone, but maybe he wasn't a clone
01:49:07 But then he was a clone and it was it got like way
01:49:11 Complex and convoluted and everybody hated it everybody makes fun of it to this day for being so shitty and dumb
01:49:17 By the end of it after like 15 years of these these clone saga stories that everyone hated
01:49:22 It was revealed that it was all part of the plan of the supervillain called the jackal and the jackal was this like weird
01:49:29 Fucking green furry. He was just like a furry version of the green goblin
01:49:33 And he's just this goofy character who just like he loves cloning like that's his supervillain origin
01:49:39 Like other supervillains have like pathos. You're looking at me like I'm getting facts wrong, but I don't care
01:49:45 Like other supervillains have like this pathos like that that make them like almost as three to three-dimensional as the supergirls
01:49:52 Like two faces a great character or fucking. I don't know Lex Luthor is a great character
01:50:00 Yeah, very underrated. Yeah, Poors and Ivy is a great character
01:50:03 Harley Quinn has all the potential in the world to be a great character
01:50:06 But they just turned her into the new Deadpool Harley Quinn was a great character at one point in time
01:50:13 It's another can of worms I'm so glad you feel that way because I think every day about unleashing that candle worms on this panel cast
01:50:19 Every time I start the panel cast I think it's just gonna be the week where I open up the fucking Harley Quinn can of worms and go on that fucking
01:50:25 five-hour rage tirade
01:50:30 Yeah, so like you know some supervillains are great and they have pathos and character arcs
01:50:36 Not the jackal the jackal just loves cloning
01:50:39 He's just and like even though the clone saga was like universally reviled and it ended and nobody ever wanted to hear about it again
01:50:46 Every once in a while the jackal still pops up again with some goofy cloning related
01:50:52 Scheme and I just love the character because he's so stupid. It's such a dumb goofy character. He just loves cloning
01:50:58 He loves cloning like the riddler loves riddles. It's his thing every time he shows up
01:51:03 I'm gonna clone there's there's a line in this comic because the jackals in this comic is it's another jackal story
01:51:08 It's another big clone story and it's reaching into all the clone history of spider-man and
01:51:14 There's there's a line from the jackal. He's talking to spider-man. He's sort of monologuing and he's like, you know
01:51:19 I've evolved spider-man. I got into a little bit of a rut there for a while
01:51:24 Cloning you and then cloning Gwen and then you and Gwen and then you and then you and then Gwen and then you for 20 fucking years
01:51:32 but um
01:51:34 It was cute, but uh, yeah, so this clone conspiracy issue is it's another
01:51:40 Big goofy clone story which I have a morbid love for I think everybody at this point like the clone saga
01:51:47 Everybody hates it, but it's also sort of become like the room where like people love making fun of it
01:51:52 Like it always gets mentioned in the comics like spider-man if you read comics
01:51:56 He constantly quips like oh, I hope I don't have to deal with any clones today
01:51:59 And it's always like a little wink and a nod like it's kind of like when Batman is always like
01:52:04 Periodically Batman would just be like I hope it's not fucking vampires today
01:52:07 Yeah, or it's like when like a when like a when like a contemporary Robin says like a holy fucking
01:52:13 Yeah, holy rested metal Batman like sort of a little nod to how campy it used to be
01:52:19 So yeah, the jackal always shows up and spider-man always has to deal with clones
01:52:23 And it's become like a kind of like a running gag at this point that spider-man
01:52:27 Half of his problems are clone related
01:52:30 so in this comic um
01:52:32 The jackal comes back and the jackal has been given a redesign which is great, and I love his redesign. Have you seen him?
01:52:39 If he was on the covers in the yes, um
01:52:42 The jackal has always been a goofy character, but I think part of the reason
01:52:47 Why nobody gives a shit about him has always been his design because he just looks like a furry green goblin
01:52:52 He was an uninspired lame character design and they've changed him and now the jackal
01:52:57 He's like a guy in a business suit with an anubis head mask, and he looks fucking cool
01:53:02 It's very a star versus the forces evil is it?
01:53:05 Yeah, well, I mean I haven't seen that toffee. That's what it reminds me of
01:53:10 He's the one of the big villains nut. I love that show by the way, but go on go. Yeah, so he meets the jackal again
01:53:16 He's like he's going around and he meets doc ock doc ock's back. He has a new body
01:53:21 Um shit. Yeah, okay
01:53:25 go on doc ock man
01:53:29 Superior spider-man
01:53:31 Elevated doc ock so much. Yeah. Yeah as like as like a credible supervillain like now
01:53:36 like I'm excited to see that doc ock's back because
01:53:40 Like again, that's an example of like character growth and how continuity is so important because it takes characters that you didn't care about
01:53:47 But they can grow and they can become better versions of the cells and suddenly I care about dr
01:53:52 Octopus I never did before and that's why you can't just have a story like one more day
01:53:56 That takes all that continuity and flushes it down the turlet
01:54:01 You can't do it
01:54:05 So there was a big storyline a couple years ago where doc ock
01:54:08 Dr. Octopus was dying. He was on his last legs and as his final scheme
01:54:12 He wanted to kill like a billion people right and spider-man stopped him
01:54:15 But then dr. Ock had a dr. Octopus had another secret scheme where he switched bodies with peter parker
01:54:21 And spider-man peter was trapped in the body of the ailing dr. Octopus and died as dr. Octopus
01:54:27 Dr. Octopus was in the body of peter parker. He took over his body. He took over his life
01:54:32 He tried to fuck mary jane. He's coming. It was some of the creepiest
01:54:36 It was really creepy. It was really a good well well written. Um, he fucked a midget
01:54:40 You know imagine getting your body back and finding out that you have a gross midget girlfriend
01:54:45 I would be devastated. I would
01:54:48 That was like the most sinister thing a super villain has ever done. He stole peter parker's body and body and made him fuck a midget
01:54:56 Yep disgusting. Wow
01:55:00 They're not in proportion. They've got weird little it's not just that there's okay, you know, I'm gonna get off this topic
01:55:06 All of your midget viewers are
01:55:11 They creep me out. I'm sorry
01:55:14 Look, I believe that midgets should have rights, but you creep me out
01:55:22 Um
01:55:24 So
01:55:25 Dr. Octopus was spider-man for a couple years
01:55:28 It was really good. It was a it was a really interesting story and like
01:55:31 Spider like peter parker. There was still a fragment of him in dr. Octopus's mind and they were fighting for control of his body
01:55:37 And it got worse. Yeah, and uh, but
01:55:40 Like the uh, sort of the crux of the series
01:55:43 was that
01:55:44 The the experience of being spider-man
01:55:48 Changed dr. Octopus and he slowly became more of a noble person until by the end of it
01:55:54 This was so brilliant how they wrote this this like slow character arc. Yeah, where by the end of it
01:55:59 Um, the green goblin is like beating up the whole city and dr. Octopus
01:56:03 He's been calling himself the superior spider-man this time. I'm better than parker
01:56:07 I can be a better spider-man than he'll ever be but by the end of it
01:56:10 There's green goblins everywhere. He's beating up the city and dr.
01:56:14 Octopus because he's become a better person because he's fallen in love with a midget
01:56:18 That's how a bad guy becomes a good guy. You fall in love with a midget and she shows you
01:56:23 the light
01:56:25 He's he's grown as a person. He's become like an actual superhero and he realizes
01:56:29 my god
01:56:31 Parker was always the superior spider-man. I can't solve this problem. I am a villain
01:56:37 And I'm an idiot and I'm a megalomaniacal fuck. I don't have what it takes to be a superior
01:56:41 He had this moment of humility where he realized that parker was the one true spider-man
01:56:46 So he goes back and he just gives in the in this beautiful character arc this moment of self-sacrifice
01:56:52 He gives peter parker his body back
01:56:55 He relinquishes control to the real spider-man and it's a beautiful moment and it elevates dr. Octopus as a character and makes him great
01:57:03 but um
01:57:04 so in this comic
01:57:07 it uh
01:57:08 The jackal has found a way
01:57:10 Not to clone people
01:57:13 But to take their memories right up until the moment of their death
01:57:17 And put them in the clones. So they're not just clones. They're basically
01:57:21 They know everything that the person knows, right? Right
01:57:24 but
01:57:26 dr. Octopus
01:57:27 Because the because dr. Octopus's body died a long time ago. He doesn't have the memories of doc ock
01:57:32 But because the superior spider-man when he did the spider-verse thing
01:57:37 He learned that he would eventually lose his body back to parker. He didn't know how yet
01:57:42 So he did some sneaky stuff and he put his brain in a computer and the computer got out and the computer put his brain
01:57:48 into the clone that the jackal made so
01:57:51 it's
01:57:53 Dr. Octopus the clone has all the memories of the superior spider-man
01:57:58 But not the memories where he became a good person and at the end gave up his body
01:58:02 So he's just kind of so he still has that grudge like spider-man. I took over your body and somehow
01:58:09 I don't know how it happened because i'm from an earlier part of it
01:58:11 I don't know how you got your body back
01:58:13 But you must have done something sneaky and spider-man has this moment where like no
01:58:17 I don't don't you see you gave me my body back
01:58:20 You became a better person and he's like i don't believe you you did something sneaky. I'm still a bad guy
01:58:25 Fuck you. I was the superior spider-man
01:58:28 So he's so he has
01:58:31 Just enough of that character development to be the superior spider-man still
01:58:34 But not enough to have completed his little arc and be a good person again. Oh, no, it's it's sad. It's I like it though
01:58:41 it's
01:58:42 so
01:58:43 So doc ock is back and he's got his body back
01:58:46 And he's he has this grudge against spider-man because all he knows is that he was the superior spider-man and somehow
01:58:53 He doesn't know how somehow parker sneaky sneaked his way back into the body
01:58:57 So now he hates him even more and so this this this this sort of b-list villain
01:59:02 Dr. Octopus has been elevated to like want to like kind of spider-man's arch nemesis more so than the green goblin now
01:59:09 And that's pretty cool. So dr. Octopus is there
01:59:13 Um, and he's beating up spider-man. He's gonna take the crap out of him. Rhino's there
01:59:17 Uh, there's a new electro who's a girl. Electra can't call her. There's already an electro. How do you do that?
01:59:24 It looked Trina. Yeah, um
01:59:27 So
01:59:28 The jackal has brought all these people back to life
01:59:31 He's brought um, yeah, and he's given them a pill
01:59:35 So he's keeping them on a leash because if they'd stop taking this pill their clone bodies will break down
01:59:40 So the jackal has brought all these spider-man villains back to life
01:59:42 But he controls them his his greatest clone related scheme yet
01:59:47 And so he's fighting dr. Octopus and the jackal shows up and says no dr. Octopus. Don't do it
01:59:52 Um, I have to monologue for a bit. Tell him about my plan
01:59:56 and so
01:59:58 the jackal
01:59:59 Take spider-man around Gwen Stacy's there. There's a Gwen Stacy clone, of course
02:00:04 um
02:00:05 The jackal is telling spider-man
02:00:08 About his plan
02:00:09 And he's saying spider-man
02:00:12 Look at what I've done. I've eliminated death forever and spider-man. He's going on that lame superhero. You played god shit
02:00:18 Cry me a fucking river. Yeah jack jack me off
02:00:21 Um, but he's like look what I've done spider-man and he opens up a door and it's every dead spider-man villain ever
02:00:28 They're all back
02:00:29 Everyone who's even like supporting characters like captain Stacy and like, you know all the all these guys all these people that spider-man has lost over the years
02:00:38 Um, he's brought them all back the hobgoblin the green goblin. I don't know if
02:00:42 Norman was actually dead. I have no idea what happened to him after the superior spider-man. Yeah, but he was in the room
02:00:47 So I don't know green goblin was there hobgoblin was there the fucking the the guy with the pumpkin head
02:00:53 What's his name? Oh, fuck. I loved him that punisher killed him in civil war 10 years ago
02:00:58 But he's back. Well, he came back in the venom series. Oh, well, he's back. They're all back
02:01:02 Everyone's back all the super villains are back and also all spider-man's dead friends are back
02:01:07 and um happy reunion
02:01:09 Yeah jackal reveals his secret plan to spider-man and it's actually a pretty
02:01:14 Clever plan and it you kind of as a reader you kind of buy into it. You're like, oh, okay. Yeah
02:01:20 um, the jackal says
02:01:22 spider-man I've brought back
02:01:25 All the villains who've died because of you and I've brought back all of your friends who've died because of you
02:01:31 The reason I've done this
02:01:32 Is to wipe your slate clean all the blood is off your hands. I'm giving you spider-man
02:01:38 Everything you've always wanted. I'm taking the blood off your hands
02:01:42 You can be a free man now free of the guilt, right? But did he bring back uncle ben? Uncle ben? I don't think was there
02:01:51 It's slight oversight on this part
02:01:54 The one person who who actually mattered who who could have changed spider-man's mind
02:02:00 But anyways, he brings everyone back. I guess his plan is to say spider-man
02:02:05 Fuck you. I did something good for you. My ultimate evil scheme doing something nice for you. How do you like that?
02:02:12 That's the kind of goofy retarded villain shit that I love
02:02:17 Um, so yeah, everyone is there
02:02:20 Uh, Gwen Stacy is there and spider-man's like this is crazy. You can't do this
02:02:24 You've brought back everyone who ever died around me. Oh my god. It's a crazy conundrum. But then spider-gwen
02:02:30 Uh starts fighting. Oh, yeah, she's not actually Gwen. She's spider-gwen. Oh, okay
02:02:35 So um, so the Gwen Stacy clone starts beating people up and they her and spider-man escape through the vents
02:02:41 and um
02:02:44 Gwen Stacy says I'm not actually a clone of Gwen Stacy
02:02:48 The real clone of Gwen Stacy that the jackal made fucked off with kane over here and they're off somewhere else. I'm a mole
02:02:53 I'm spider-gwen from a secret universe. I'm blue. I have spider powers. Whatever
02:02:59 Whatever the fuck and then it so they escape
02:03:02 Peter escapes with spider-gwen and then it cuts to kane and kane is in another city. I think he lives in Dallas, right?
02:03:09 Yeah, oh well houston houston houston
02:03:12 So, um kane is in houston and is driving around his spider car because there's no web slingy buildings in houston. I guess
02:03:18 No, well not unless you're in downtown Dallas
02:03:22 So it cuts to kane and
02:03:24 He's got the actual Gwen Stacy clone with him
02:03:28 And that's how it ends. He it's the reveal that the the Gwen Stacy clone and the spider-gwen have switched places
02:03:35 and they've
02:03:37 Yeah, and now they're gonna bang
02:03:40 I do love me some scarlet spider. Yeah
02:03:42 That was one of my favorite like many runs of any kind of off scarlet spider because we keep mentioning him
02:03:47 But I haven't explained who he is yet. He's uh, he's one of the many many clones of spider-man
02:03:53 But he's the best one. He's definitely the best one. I can't recommend scarlet spider enough
02:03:57 Yeah, he's he's he's all the superpowers, but none of the responsibility. He fucking hates the responsibility
02:04:03 He fucking hates peter parker. He's like a misanthrope and he's a jerk
02:04:06 He ran away to houston because there were no heroes there and he's like good
02:04:11 Yeah, fuck it and he's sitting on the couch like getting fat eating cheetos and
02:04:17 Suddenly like his whole life is just ruined by the news
02:04:20 Because he happened to save some old lady who's trying to cross the street and an 18 wheeler almost smushed her
02:04:24 And he was like no fuck her. She can die. I don't care. This is okay
02:04:27 But of course, you know at the last second he saves her but in the process like destroys the 18 wheeler with his body
02:04:33 And hurts the 18 wheeler trucker
02:04:35 um
02:04:36 And anyway, he's like
02:04:38 Getting a fucking home old lady. Why are you trying to cross the street? This is awful
02:04:42 And like he slings off he fucks off back home and the news all of a sudden is like wow
02:04:47 houston has a hero
02:04:49 We don't know what he is, but we're gonna call him the scarlet spider and he's just like
02:04:53 I'm going to mexico. Yeah, I can't I can't live here anymore. Yeah. He's a good old boy. I fucking love him
02:05:00 He's my hero. Do you happen to know uh, what the fuck ever happened to ben reilly?
02:05:05 Does anyone know no, I don't think anyone knows
02:05:09 That it's also convoluted. He was he was an important character for a while
02:05:13 but
02:05:14 That was a long time ago. Maybe maybe spider-man's deal with mafisto got rid of him. Maybe he just doesn't exist anymore
02:05:21 Just lost in the ether. Yeah
02:05:23 Anyways, I liked that comic. I am enjoying spider-man the clone conspiracy
02:05:29 Despite all the stuff I hate about spider-man lately. I'll read it eventually
02:05:33 There's been a lot of offshoots for clone conspiracy. So I've been a little less than inclined to try it out
02:05:39 um
02:05:40 But you know, I'll I'll still read it eventually. It's just it's one of those things
02:05:44 Um because the prowler is now a thing in clone conspiracy is an offshoot and some other shit came out. I don't know
02:05:50 so next up uh
02:05:52 What else were you any other comics? Do you want to talk about this week?
02:05:55 Um, no, not really, but I do want to mention that I hope eventually you do read them and talk about them, but
02:06:02 Um, I've been obsessively introducing people to the legend of luther strode series
02:06:07 Oh, yeah, you gave it to me, but I haven't read it yet. No, you will eventually. I'm sure
02:06:12 Um, I fucking it. It's the fantastic trilogy. It's the best trilogy. I love it. I can't recommend it enough
02:06:18 It's drawn by trad moor who did the all you ghost writer at least the first six issues of it
02:06:22 He's done other things. He's been doing several avengers covers um marvel covers in general. He did the latest
02:06:28 Not the latest the issue the suicide issue for a fucking deadpool. He did that cover
02:06:33 He's done a lot of great covers. He's got great art. I fucking love him. I fucking I fucking love luther strode
02:06:38 I'll touch his wiener. I don't even care. It's it's big and scary. I'm sure or or maybe it didn't grow with the rest of them
02:06:44 who knows um
02:06:46 but
02:06:47 Let me actually talk about what it actually is. So it fans of kick ass or even fans who
02:06:54 You know
02:06:55 Expected greater things at a kick ass. I don't know. Did you ever read kick ass?
02:07:00 Is that's all the movie the movie I read kick ass too and I did not care for it
02:07:05 I don't think anybody did good. There was there were some problems with that one. Um, but
02:07:10 uh luther strode follows a run-of-the-mill nerdy kid in high school who ends up finding a book
02:07:17 That it seems innocuous at first, but
02:07:20 You can derive power from it depending on whether or not you're capable of understanding it
02:07:25 So he takes his book he starts reading it. He starts taking, you know advice from it. He starts working out next thing
02:07:32 You know, he's a big buff dude who has the like the power to
02:07:37 predict
02:07:39 anyone's movements
02:07:40 Like it's interesting. He can look at somebody and he can actually
02:07:45 practically see their future in every sense like all
02:07:49 Like it all means um, and it makes the fight seem so he can look at a flaccid penis and see a boner
02:07:55 Yeah, and he can see which way it's gonna bone
02:08:01 Um, and it actually makes the fight scenes all the more interesting
02:08:04 Because you know, he can predict like bullet trajectories. He can predict them
02:08:09 It's just it's a mess of things that he can do and he becomes so powerful
02:08:14 that
02:08:15 He basically evades death because he can will his body to do whatever he wants it to
02:08:21 So let's say for example, he gets shot in the chest by a bullet
02:08:24 He can actually control his muscles to such a degree that he can catch the bullets with his chest and just spin him back out
02:08:30 He has that much control over his body. There's an entire scene an entire fight scene
02:08:34 Where him and another person just like him just like him in quotations
02:08:39 um
02:08:40 He's trying to kill him and you see them fight and suddenly Luther like jumps over him grabs him by his head
02:08:46 And snaps his neck all the way around like it's dangling between his shoulders
02:08:51 But the guy has so much control over his own body that he defies death and ends up pulling his neck back onto his fucking shoulders
02:08:58 And his find like it's it's an interesting series. That's full of violence and gore
02:09:04 And I love it sounds pretty groovy
02:09:06 It's fucking manly. I can't get over it
02:09:11 Um, that's really all I wanted to talk about if there were other things to talk about
02:09:15 I've already forgotten because these past two weeks have been completely forgettable
02:09:18 I'm sorry DC and marvel image titles have been good cannibal was good
02:09:22 If you haven't read cannibal yet the second issue just released this week
02:09:25 Um, but I'm a baby boy. I only know about superheroes
02:09:31 Hey images superheroes trillium well not trillium. I'm sorry not trillium fucking plutona
02:09:36 I only know about marvel and DC because they make movies and I'm a casual. I'm a little casual baby boy
02:09:42 Fair enough
02:09:43 I'm a little casual baby bitch
02:09:47 That's about the extent of what I had to say though. I mean, there's always more that I could say but how long has this been going on for?
02:09:52 Yeah, it's about two hours and 17 minutes now
02:09:56 Good good, but um
02:10:00 Goodbye
02:10:02 Yes
02:10:13 Hey everybody welcome back to the panel cast it and I I fucking
02:10:18 Woo, I just recorded a fucking three hour cluster fuck goes to the most heinous
02:10:23 Wonderful addition to the panel cast ever, but it's still not over. It's still I'm still here
02:10:28 Uh, I have another guest here's digi bro. Oh, we're gonna talk about going by the second guest
02:10:35 Yeah, I had a first guest. Yeah, I wanted to know who the history guest is
02:10:40 um, so
02:10:42 Uh
02:10:43 Wait, what is this podcast? This is about comics. Yes that one
02:10:46 Fuck they like go through the rolodex of all the podcast. I I literally just like I just just I just like blew my mind
02:10:53 Like raging raging about like everything related to every comic ever written for like two hours
02:10:59 And now we have to talk about uh the new gwen pool. I assume you because I've I've succeeded
02:11:04 I've actually succeeded in swaying some people to reading comics. Yeah in particular digi who's an all comics boy
02:11:11 Yeah, I gotta say man. The panel cast has changed my whole life, man
02:11:15 Now I'm you could you are consuming comics at an alarming rate
02:11:19 I feel like one of these weeks you'll have read more comics than I have I feel like that's gonna take a long time
02:11:25 Uh, you know, I've I've come to realize that you're so much better at this than anybody else
02:11:29 I know who reads comics my my brother shade tried to ask our friend brandon tolantino long time comics guy
02:11:35 Like, you know, what are some good comics and tolantino's just like
02:11:41 I just read iron man
02:11:44 We were like it's so impossible to even talk about or like
02:11:47 Because I was just talking about this before
02:11:49 um
02:11:51 Even complaining about like a comic you don't like in order to get context for it
02:11:55 You have to complain about something 10 years ago that you didn't like and then go back 20 years from there
02:11:59 Or something that like some act some storyline
02:12:02 Like 25 years ago that set into motion this domino effect that led to the bad comic you're currently reading
02:12:09 So everything i'm trying to complain about turns into an hour long history lesson on this fucking show
02:12:13 Well, thankfully you've given two recommendations that I I picked up from previous episodes specifically because they didn't seem like
02:12:20 They needed that much context which were gwen pool and the vision because both of them are
02:12:25 They have lots of other heroes in them
02:12:27 But the stories are pretty self-contained and pretty much about those characters the vision ended you already talked about it
02:12:34 Great run. Um, just bought volume one yesterday got my brother reading it. Um
02:12:40 Gwen pool volume one unfortunately not out yet, but chapter eight came out yesterday. I read it
02:12:45 Uh, it was it was okay. It was very cute. That's the main thing. I took away from it. Um, it wasn't super eventful
02:12:52 No, um, not a whole lot happened. I mean the last issue ended
02:12:56 She was on the subway and the cops are coming to get her in this episode. She fucked around
02:13:00 She ran away from the cops. She did some shit. She was gonna do something to blow up those squid aliens the toothed ins
02:13:06 Yeah, and um at the end of it turns out she fucked up so bad that her employer doesn't want her anymore
02:13:13 Yeah, and so he's gonna kill her but then she shot him
02:13:16 And but then it turns out he's a robot man. He's not even a regular man
02:13:20 Yeah, I mean the thing about this comic is that it's it's it's gotten to the point
02:13:24 Or it's kind of spinning its wheels a little bit in that
02:13:27 We we we kind of get what gwen's big problem is is that she doesn't see this world as a real place for some reason
02:13:33 She just thinks it's a comic that's kind of her big
02:13:36 Hangup and it's it's kind of been reiterating that over and over again. So now I'm officially as of this issue
02:13:41 I'm at the point where I'm like gwen when are you gonna realize?
02:13:45 Yeah, there was a point in this comic where she's like she was doing her, you know
02:13:48 Yeah, none of this is real stuff and it was at this at that point in this issue
02:13:53 I was like hasn't she had like the sad realization twice now already
02:13:58 Like she's already had her character arc twice over and she's just kind of looping it seems like
02:14:03 It's a little odd and
02:14:05 One of the things that I I can't decide if I do or don't really like this about the comic is that gwen herself
02:14:12 Is like adorable. She's like this super cute peppy young girl who does not at all
02:14:19 Look like a psycho murderer like the way she acts
02:14:22 And so I'm wondering like is that intentional because like she just so much doesn't think this is real
02:14:28 That like in her mind
02:14:29 It's like playing a video game like even a normal person would go around and kill people in a video game, you know
02:14:35 But like she just acts so fucking psychotic that whenever her mask is off
02:14:38 I'm always like god. She's way too cute to be this crazy, you know, yeah
02:14:43 Well, like it's kind of weird because I think it might to some degree just be the art style that makes it seen that way because
02:14:51 She was introduced late last year
02:14:54 In uh, howard the duck as like a backup story where she showed up and she's like, hey duck man
02:15:00 I'm a crazy bitch. I got guns and because of the artwork in that story
02:15:05 Um, I really got the sense that she was like an adult like in her mid to late 20s or something
02:15:11 Like because she looked like you know a muscly abs having like a grown-up ass deadpool knockoff
02:15:17 Then in her ongoing series because the art style is so manga-y and cutesy
02:15:21 He looks like she's a teenager all of a sudden and I mean when she went marvels when she came over to spider-man's house
02:15:26 And she like said that she was a classmate like it really kind of implied that she is high school age
02:15:31 But they've never had a good there's never been a moment of like here's exactly how old she is, you know
02:15:38 yeah, um
02:15:40 So I've just kind of assumed that she's like 18 or so
02:15:43 Based on the spider-man part, but it's hard to say. She's she's definitely like a weird mixture of a fucking idiot and
02:15:51 Kind of a genius in other ways
02:15:53 She's good at tactics. Not so good at morals and understanding people
02:15:59 But the most important thing about this issue that I wanted to talk to you about
02:16:03 Is how we finally saw the crazy goth girl without her helmet on and she was mad fucking cute
02:16:09 Yeah, that was awesome. I was just like, whoa
02:16:12 Who's this incredibly hot character? Oh my god, it's the crazy girl
02:16:17 I had so Gwen pool has this co-worker this evil co-worker
02:16:21 As part of her modoc organization that she sort of runs or ran until this issue
02:16:27 Um called the evil eye and she's like a crazy witch lady with a stupid helmet
02:16:31 Who says spooky things all the time and this episode?
02:16:35 She went into her room and the lady was there and she was just like a normal girl and she's like, oh my god
02:16:40 Gwen we've never seen each other out of costume before and like her speech was different and she was talking like a normal person
02:16:46 And uh, she sort of played it up like a kayfabe thing like when the mask when i'm in character
02:16:51 I go a little I go a little too far. Yeah, well that she like I guess the the mask like lets her
02:16:57 See all this crazy information that she can't perceive normally and it just makes her insane
02:17:02 But as soon as she takes it off she's just back to normal and she doesn't like remember what the mask was showing her
02:17:08 That was adorbs. I definitely I just said the word adorbs. Yeah, you did adorable total sincerity
02:17:15 Yeah, um, I definitely I love her supporting cast. I love bat rock. I like that bat rock isn't a comic doing something
02:17:22 He's a cool guy. Yeah. Well, that's a that's the funny thing for me is
02:17:27 When it wasn't until
02:17:28 The evil eye took her helmet off that I realized she's from Gwen pool like
02:17:35 For me as a new comics reader every comic I read there's always like a shitload of characters
02:17:40 And some of them you can tell are new like if you're reading a the current dr. Strange run
02:17:45 There's like dr. Strange. He's got his sidekick the uh, the asian guy
02:17:49 There's the grand mask
02:17:50 You know you can tell which characters are there from older comics
02:17:54 But then there's this new girl who's like an assistant that he picks up to like manage his library
02:17:59 Who shows up in issue number one and like she's kind of an important character now in this current run of the comics
02:18:05 But she's totally new
02:18:07 And now i'm wondering am I gonna start seeing this girl turn up in other marvel comics now that she's been introduced
02:18:14 In this one and then i'm reading Gwen pool and like obviously like you said, uh, what's his name the the french guy?
02:18:20 Uh bat rock zele pair. Yeah, he's he's like they like she explains to him that he's from
02:18:27 Previous comics like he's obviously an older character
02:18:30 I love how they're using him because he's just like this sort of
02:18:33 Kind of forgotten about like old sea list captain america villain
02:18:37 And they sort of like the way he's utilized in this story like even though he's like a sea listener and a nobody
02:18:42 He's a veteran of this world and he's sort of the mentor to this idiotic teenage girl
02:18:47 Would you say this is the most interesting his character's ever been?
02:18:50 Definitely, yeah
02:18:52 And and then but but he's yeah, there's these other two members of the team and like
02:18:56 I have no idea if these these guys are have ever been in anything before
02:19:00 You know or will they be in something from now because like
02:19:03 The vision just ended and now all of a sudden the vision's daughter is showing up in other comics being turned into an sjw
02:19:11 Yeah, I said my piece about that already this week
02:19:14 What comic was that? Yeah, like that was in champions number two
02:19:19 And wish I I literally raged about for a full hour
02:19:24 Amazing at the beginning of this podcast
02:19:27 Yeah, um
02:19:29 Yeah, you always want when you read comics like this that have a cool little cast or they introduce new characters
02:19:34 You always want to see them pop up in other comics, but then when they do
02:19:40 Kind of regret it. Yeah, like you like oh, no
02:19:43 I have a
02:19:44 You know being new to comics and all I read the vision and it never even occurred to me
02:19:49 That the daughter might show up again until all at once jesse said like
02:19:55 She showed up and they ruined her and it was like within the same page
02:19:59 That you showed me. I was like, oh the vision's daughter is in another comic. That's awesome. Oh
02:20:06 I real I have already been introduced to the gross disappointment that comes with caring about anything
02:20:12 It was a it was a sad time
02:20:15 Indeed. Um, yeah, so anyways, I definitely hope that uh
02:20:20 That this series like you know goes somewhere
02:20:23 Yeah, I'd like and I hope that it completes itself or has like an arc to it. Yeah, or I don't know
02:20:30 It's it kind of the the modoc arc felt
02:20:33 Fairly complete. She killed him
02:20:36 And since then it feels like it's it hasn't really gotten its footing on the start of this new arc
02:20:40 But there's still yeah, there's like the plot threads that we need to have concluded are very obvious
02:20:45 It's like we need to know what's up with ghost boy
02:20:48 Uh, yeah, she needs to make up with spider-man somehow and like learn that this world is uh a real place
02:20:55 You know, and I still want to see her origin. Yeah, and that too. We need to know her
02:20:59 We talked about that not on a pipe. We talked about that amongst ourselves. Yeah, I'll like uh, it's cool how like
02:21:05 Because she's been so unwilling to give us her origin because it's so overdone
02:21:09 Yeah, that it's created this like
02:21:11 Weird like reverse psychology thing where now I want to see her origin
02:21:16 And I want to see like how the hell she got here because they keep like slightly alluding to it
02:21:20 Like dr. Strange and that one is she was like, oh, what how the hell did you get here?
02:21:23 And she's like, I don't want to talk about it ever. It's a bad time and I'm like, yeah
02:21:27 Yeah, I want it. I want the fact that she's so adamant about the idea that she doesn't want to talk about it because it's clearly something traumatic
02:21:34 Makes it even more like well now I like what was so traumatic about it
02:21:39 I gotta know, you know, uh, yeah, it is a good reverse psychology. I definitely I want to see her be like
02:21:46 Um a popular character. I don't know if she is or how well
02:21:51 I'm getting I'm getting a nod yes from the person here who is works at a comic book store. Oh really?
02:21:56 Yeah, I just uh, uh, I didn't even know you had a guest in the room. Hi guest
02:22:02 He says hi
02:22:03 Um, yeah at the start of gwen pool eight when she's doing the recap thing
02:22:07 She she describes herself as like surely the best-selling character
02:22:12 And I wasn't sure like when I read that I was like either she's selling really well
02:22:16 Or this is a joke about how badly this comic is selling like it's got to be one or the other
02:22:21 But I'm glad to know it's yeah
02:22:23 I definitely hope that she continues to be
02:22:26 sort of a
02:22:28 Mainstay in the marvel universe. I hope she shows up in other comics
02:22:31 I'm I want to see her interact with as many other characters as possible. That's kind of the best part of it
02:22:36 Is seeing her
02:22:38 Interact with all the all the established superheroes and stuff because she's got such a weird outsider perspective
02:22:43 I want to see her hang out with deadpool because that's the character that she's sort of ripping off
02:22:48 Obviously has to happen right like yeah, surely that's the unspoken thing that we're building up to somehow
02:22:54 Yeah, that's gotta be like the final boss or something
02:22:57 Yeah, because like because deadpool part of his whole thing is the break in the like he knows he's in the comic too
02:23:03 So it seems only logical to have
02:23:06 Them meet and bond over it. I mean surely she's aware of deadpool because that's who she modeled herself after right? Yeah, so
02:23:15 Yeah, it's interesting how they have like deliberately not made mention of deadpool as if
02:23:20 Like in order for her to breathe as her own character like we can't mention deadpool because then it'll just seem like
02:23:26 But then you know, it has to happen someday
