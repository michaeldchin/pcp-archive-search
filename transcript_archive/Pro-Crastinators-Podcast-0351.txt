00:00:00 I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.
00:00:13 Welcome to another episode of the The Pro Crastinators podcast.
00:00:20 I was going to say that.
00:00:23 Well I said it.
00:00:24 It's me.

00:00:47 Didn't watch the entire episode. I got a little bit into it and then I skip to live any kind I get the end
00:00:52 I think at the end there was like there's one other word that you'd like
00:00:56 Bit air you like break a word and in half
00:01:02 Like better like better
00:01:05 No, no, there's like when you when you said
00:01:07 When you remember remember how last week on the episode you said beans on toast, but you said it like be beans on toast
00:01:14 Beans on toast. Yeah, those are my favorite. That's my favorite. That's what I always say is beans on toast. Yeah, what's the oh, right?
00:01:21 Yeah, that's that's what they call it breakfast as well
00:01:24 That's what they call it. That's what they call it over there
00:01:28 and eggs
00:01:31 It goes
00:01:32 Saw I saw a picture of a full English breakfast going around Twitter yet yesterday. I
00:01:38 Am I am a fan? I am a fan of the full English breakfast. I have a mini
00:01:44 English breakfast
00:01:46 Most mornings I have like bacon egg and toast sometimes with beans
00:01:52 It's just really nice. It's funny
00:01:55 You you actually you actually eat beans
00:02:00 Yeah, what's wrong with this? What is wrong with this? I think it I think in America. We just don't eat beans that we just don't eat
00:02:08 them any beans
00:02:09 Sure, you do. You got like
00:02:11 Mexican food with beans in it. Yeah, Mexicans do. Yeah, Mexican food
00:02:15 That's just have like a shitty bean from from Heinz
00:02:19 I'm talking about real Americans kib. You know what I'm saying. You know what I'm saying
00:02:27 Click my stopwatch we do I mean we do eat beans just not for breakfast. It's not a breakfast food
00:02:34 One day I'll try those like the British beans in the in like the tomato sauce
00:02:39 Because we don't we don't have those there. Do you have them in the like Malat? No, no, no, rarely
00:02:44 I guess if it's not a common thing you wouldn't see it sold
00:02:48 No, that that particular style of being I mean maybe you can get it somewhere but in the British aisle
00:02:55 We have them in the in the molasses that they have a British aisle
00:02:58 I remember when I was over probably there was like, oh, where's the British aisle? Where's the the the tea?
00:03:06 There was a little little section with British things I recognized
00:03:10 What what store?
00:03:12 I don't food line like where were we like just getting groceries
00:03:17 Was it in Boston?
00:03:22 Because we don't have we don't have food line that would have been Virginia then I I don't remember but like
00:03:29 What are the racons?
00:03:31 Wait, was right before Virginia?
00:03:33 No, that was
00:03:35 Those yeah, yeah, it was no it was it was it probably was that then that three was in Massachusetts. They had like um
00:03:41 Yorkshire tea, which is my favorite black tea
00:03:45 I like I like black. I like black
00:03:50 Don't like Mexican. I like black
00:03:54 Anyway, let's continue
00:03:56 Uh speaking of rad con
00:03:59 Yeah, we were saying, uh
00:04:01 The the ova is in
00:04:05 The channel
00:04:06 It is uploaded
00:04:08 We have not watched it yet. I dread looking at it. Yeah
00:04:12 Uh
00:04:14 Yeah, me too
00:04:16 Yeah, it's gonna be bad and we're gonna do a upset a ben and gib reacts
00:04:22 The commentary track, I guess
00:04:24 I think yeah, that's a bonus for bonus episode patrons of the patreon
00:04:29 patrons of the patreon
00:04:31 Yeah, that
00:04:33 Yeah, that is yeah, that is the plan. I expect that the the commentary to be mostly like, oh
00:04:39 Oh
00:04:41 No, I like over and over do you think we'll like pause?
00:04:45 Well, do you think we'll have to pause it because like it's a it's a short video
00:04:48 It's only we'll post it to like be like, oh and here's some background on this shot
00:04:53 Uh, something something
00:04:55 I think I think we should I think we should because I I remember it's it's only been
00:05:00 Two years. I remember three years actually actually, uh, no no joke. I think
00:05:06 Uh, Sean said in the pcp like discord
00:05:10 Or maybe it was in my discord or somewhere. It's been three years. It was my I think I think yeah
00:05:15 I think the the anniversary is like this monday like night. I think maybe I think it's
00:05:21 Tomorrow as of the day we recording it or like
00:05:24 Yeah, like this week that this this this episode comes out is like the radcon anniversary
00:05:30 The third anniversary
00:05:33 Remember life before coronavirus
00:05:39 You know, what's really funny is how like the um
00:05:42 The pcpe and the radcon 4 lore like incorporates coronavirus into it because it was like a new funny thing at the time
00:05:52 and then
00:05:54 It continued to be a thing and then it continued to be a thing
00:05:57 Now it's now it's still funny because it's been so long that it's still a thing
00:06:02 And it's funny that despite being so out of date that it's still irrelevant
00:06:06 honestly
00:06:08 here
00:06:09 Yeah, that's a funny way to say it because it wasn't it was never relevant
00:06:14 Uh, is coronavirus in the ova probably right?
00:06:19 Yeah, that was the story
00:06:21 Spoilers
00:06:23 Spoilers for those who have not clicked on it yet spoilers spoilers for road to radcon the novella written by
00:06:31 Trixie and myself
00:06:34 Uh, coronavirus is in that as well
00:06:37 if I mentioned how
00:06:39 How I was I reread it a little bit the other day. It's I think it's really funny
00:06:43 I think the final chapter is funny. I'm proud of my myself. Yeah, I remember enjoying it. It was good
00:06:49 It was good. It didn't feel like it was completely different from what came before
00:06:54 I tried I tried to match the style as best I could and I think I did a these job because
00:06:59 I like deliberately sort of took the the way that
00:07:02 I don't know if Trixie was doing it for humor or if it's just the way she writes dialogue
00:07:07 but she had a particular way of
00:07:10 being like
00:07:12 You know quote quote
00:07:14 so and so like
00:07:16 So and so verbed and I don't know it just it she would use weird verbs for and I think it was deliberate that there would be like
00:07:23 Just matter of factly stating that someone
00:07:26 Did a speech verb that is very like weird and idiosyncratic or would use like a whole phrase for the speech verb
00:07:33 or something like that and so I tried to match that and I
00:07:38 There were other it quirks to it too and
00:07:42 I don't know whatever. I'm bright. I'm just I'm just so smart. I'm just so good
00:07:46 um
00:07:47 when
00:07:48 I don't I don't
00:07:51 I do you think well, do you think we'll have it like up?
00:07:56 I don't know if we're gonna have it up to watch this week. Um, maybe probably I mean
00:08:02 Maybe it's it's there. So the only thing left is for it to go live, right?
00:08:06 There's no other things we need
00:08:08 Well, we have to get we have to put it live
00:08:11 And I'm it's well, it's waiting for a um, it is waiting for like a content
00:08:16 Id like like advertiser check for some reason it was flagged as like inappropriate for advertisers
00:08:22 Sure. Yeah
00:08:23 and
00:08:24 Okay, I I forgot about this
00:08:27 But there was also the uncensored version
00:08:30 Yeah, remember that
00:08:32 I forgot that that was kind of the joke was that there was going to be the regular version that has like beams of light and like
00:08:38 Sensor bars and then there was going to be the uncensored version that you can only get by being a patron that doesn't have that
00:08:45 and then
00:08:48 Yeah, so
00:08:49 Nate Nate put
00:08:51 The ova's he put both versions on the youtube channel
00:08:55 And they're unlisted and he like requested
00:08:58 Review for both of them and I unrequested the review for the uncensored version because like I don't care that one doesn't need to be monetized
00:09:05 That's one's patrons only it's it's it's doesn't need ads on it. It's not gonna it's not gonna get more than like maybe a couple hundred views
00:09:13 Uh, god willing neither of them will get any views at all. Yes
00:09:19 So I don't even want them to review that one because it was like it had the word naked in the description
00:09:24 And it's like uncensored and it looked like it's sort of designed to look like pornography
00:09:29 And I don't even want them to look at it. I don't want them to be asked to check. Is this appropriate for youtube?
00:09:35 Because what if they're like they're uploading pornography to youtube and then channel strike. Yeah
00:09:41 Yeah, so I was just forget it forget that one
00:09:43 Never mind. Don't even add. Yeah
00:09:46 The other one is waiting for review
00:09:49 and um
00:09:52 Uh
00:09:54 And then it'll be out and then that'll be it. I think you said you're gonna release the dojin in conjunction with the
00:10:02 OVA
00:10:03 Yes
00:10:05 They are we up on the website
00:10:07 And I believe I haven't actually done it yet, but I believe I now have the the power to put the website online
00:10:16 And so that will be uh, I'll try and put that up. Yeah, okay. So on the website the procrastinators.com
00:10:23 Or perfect party podcast. No perfect party perfect comic dot no perfect party
00:10:30 Oh my god, perfect comic party dot com. Is that it comic? Yes, perfect comic party dot com
00:10:36 There'll be like a link at the top for like pcp stuff and then on the pcp stuff page. There will be
00:10:43 A downloadable. There's a road to radcon and there's the dojin
00:10:48 Those will be downloadable
00:10:51 As well, there's also a link to uh the the dating sim
00:10:54 Uh, if you haven't played that I don't think I've read the entire dojin. So that that'll be interesting
00:10:59 I'm looking forward to that because that looks the what I've seen looks very good
00:11:04 I have
00:11:05 I mean, I have read the entire dojin because I I you know
00:11:09 Largely put it together
00:11:12 The the dojin uh, is very
00:11:17 Funny, I think it's really it's funny because
00:11:20 It was written. I commissioned who is it? It was chip wiseman never paint and aura barista
00:11:27 They wrote like skits for it and I and I commissioned them to write skits for it
00:11:32 When radcon was already like a year or more over
00:11:36 It was already like freaking uh radcon four is already a distant memory and everything's changed
00:11:43 And uh lemau I can't believe we're still doing this and that was like a year and a half ago and now
00:11:50 Even that feels like a distant memory irrelevant. Why are we still why did we still do this?
00:11:55 uh
00:11:57 And yet and yet since a lot of the jokes are sort of at the expense of like ha ha remember how
00:12:03 The pcp was gonna start pcp hq ha ha remember how they work
00:12:07 So how how they thought content was gonna was gonna cantant was gonna go somewhere ha ha remember how uh
00:12:14 What else what else they didn't used to be corona
00:12:18 Whatever a lot of it is jokes about that and and I feel like that stuff has aged pretty well possibly even even better
00:12:25 So then I really think that it was it's written by old head pcp listeners those three
00:12:30 And so I think if you are an old head pcp listener
00:12:34 You are gonna get a kick out of the gags and the stuff in there that is very very deep cut like ha ha I get this reference
00:12:42 kind of stuff I think I I think I
00:12:44 am a genius for going with for picking those those three and also
00:12:50 Um drinking moth who has done some sent in some some art to the voicemails
00:12:56 She did uh not all but a lot of the art on it and I just want to shout her out in particular
00:13:04 Because of how good she is and how fast she was like I appreciate so much
00:13:11 that I would
00:13:13 Tell her like hey, can you draw this page and she'd be like
00:13:16 Yeah, yeah, I'll do that and then she'd have it in like three days or something. She'd be like yeah, here you go
00:13:23 And and and in that and in life. It's not it's it's rare
00:13:27 It's rare to find someone who doesn't ruin your fucking life when you work with them
00:13:32 So I appreciate her a lot
00:13:36 um
00:13:38 What's her at is it is it at drinking moth?
00:13:41 On twitter at drinking moth on twitter, please commissioned at drinking moth on twitter
00:13:49 You there good. Yeah, sorry. I was joining no no because it was boring. I just oh so
00:13:57 Uh commissioned drinking I highly I really recommend drinking moth a lot is really impressed
00:14:01 And I really appreciate the work that she did and also, you know, there's there's a there's a chapter
00:14:06 There's a there's a segment that knew
00:14:09 Drawn by new
00:14:10 And there's a segment called uh, who was drawn by I mean, there's a bunch by there's a bunch by ed
00:14:17 I guess you remember that didn't
00:14:19 Things didn't go so well with ed
00:14:21 It's a couple by
00:14:23 Kaiju who did not want to be credited as Kaiju
00:14:26 So it's credited as k instead
00:14:28 I'm not sure why but that's that's how it that's what he wanted
00:14:32 And then there's uh, am I forgetting someone?
00:14:36 Am I forgetting something?
00:14:39 What?
00:14:40 Uh
00:14:42 There was the one that simsie drew but only simsie. Uh, yeah simsie sketched one and then Kaiju finished it. Yeah
00:14:50 So, yeah, let's see. I mean, I mean here I'll just go to my version of the website
00:14:55 By download the dojin
00:14:57 Here we go. There's chat. I'm reading the home page reading the front page
00:15:01 chapter listing
00:15:03 chapter listing
00:15:05 Here are the chapters. You know what? I'll I'll screenshot it
00:15:10 Here's a here's a preview of the
00:15:13 Of the table of table of contents of the radcon for paradise dojin, which I
00:15:20 Pain stakingly
00:15:22 arranged

00:15:46 Uh written by or barista drawn by simsie and k and drinking moth altered beasts written by or barista drawn by drinking moth
00:15:55 Have you have you read altered beasts? I don't think so
00:15:58 That one's really good and I think
00:16:01 You would like it a lot
00:16:05 Do you have the pdf do you want it?
00:16:08 Uh, I mean sure. I'll I'll go to the website when it's live and get it there. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay

00:16:51 and tech technically wrote to radcon never

00:16:56 I I I I gave backers their copies their physical copies

00:17:11 You can read that as well. Nice
00:17:13 And then the rad content is done, baby

00:18:07 Like rat radcon five protecting democracy like like protecting nato in ukraine
00:18:14 Which would how much do you think a kickstarter for that would raise?
00:18:18 Uh millions millions and millions
00:18:23 We couldn't we couldn't like like stretch goal. We kill putin. We'd like live stream it if you give a if we if our kickstarter reaches
00:18:30 One billion
00:18:33 Commando like uh like rappel into
00:18:37 Whatever building is the main russian building. I don't know the kremlin the kremlin building
00:18:42 We smash through the windows live streaming with a phone on our head
00:18:47 You said mr. Putin
00:18:50 You're under arrest
00:18:52 Mr. Putin you're under arrest. I say bashing his head in the blood with my mace
00:18:58 Uh couldn't possibly go wrong

00:19:09 Um, yeah, okay rat rat radcon five
00:19:13 um
00:19:14 Radcon five uh protecting ukraine and democracy protecting democracy in the ukraine
00:19:20 Uh coming soon keep your keep your isp
00:19:25 Ah, well, I've got a
00:19:28 Not really an announcement yet
00:19:30 Uh, we're but speaking of websites
00:19:33 Uh, i'm redoing i'm getting some help to get my give and take dot site
00:19:38 Into a state that is nice and not bad and it is good actually
00:19:44 Yeah, the moment it's just a little sad
00:19:47 And there's gonna be uh, oh
00:19:49 Uh, it's gonna have all the comics already have but it's also gonna have a new thing for red man comics
00:19:54 I'm gonna put those on there
00:19:56 And it's gonna have buttons and it's gonna be nice and smooth and works
00:20:01 And it's not gonna be hosted by wordpress
00:20:03 And it's gonna be and i'm learning all about the code all about the little
00:20:08 the json and the
00:20:10 Files and the things
00:20:12 Oh very nice very nice. So it's all gonna be easy to upload. I'm gonna be able to like
00:20:18 Just add a bunch of images into a folder
00:20:20 On my computer and then do a little update or thing in a jig and it'll just put them on on the website
00:20:27 Oh, that's really
00:20:29 That's really interesting. That's really good. I actually don't know how to do that. You know, I was
00:20:34 I was I made the website as simple as possible just because
00:20:38 Like I didn't
00:20:39 If I if I knew how to do that I I I kind of was gonna set it up so that like
00:20:44 There would be the home page and then on the home page
00:20:47 There would be like a link that you could click for like
00:20:49 The latest episode and it would bring you to the latest episode and then there'd be another link for like
00:20:55 Here's all the episodes
00:20:56 but um
00:20:58 Yeah, I didn't really know
00:21:00 How to like set it up
00:21:02 You I would probably I think I would probably need like json or
00:21:06 um
00:21:09 Java or something to have it dynamically have that link like dynamically altered to be like it points to whatever the newest
00:21:16 Like episode is
00:21:18 Because otherwise I would have to like upload all the every little pages individually
00:21:21 And I would rather just upload just just put it in the one
00:21:25 Yeah, it's it's really clever because it's like in the json file is like
00:21:30 there's
00:21:31 you know a
00:21:33 Comic name and then it's got like information about it and then pages and then it says link to this image show this image
00:21:40 And as long as I give it the right file name the same as I give the images
00:21:45 I can just put the images in a folder and then the data file will read it and just put it on the website without me having to do anything
00:21:53 That's really interesting. I mean if you if you once you know how to do that
00:21:58 Do you think you might like be able to like I don't know
00:22:02 Make our website do that with like our homepage just point like have a like well get the new get the newest episode
00:22:09 It's being built by someone else and they're teaching me how to add to it. So I don't know how to make it
00:22:14 From scratch. I know how to
00:22:16 Yeah to use the things that are already there to like add new pages and update it and stuff
00:22:23 I see because I am my brain shuts down when I look at code most of the time
00:22:28 Really really kicks out of me
00:22:30 Lamal
00:22:32 Lamal
00:22:33 Listen, listen, buddy
00:22:35 I made endless war
00:22:37 personally
00:22:39 Yeah, you know, that's very good. I created him and I could destroy him
00:22:45 But I don't know how to use javascript to make my text link link to a different file
00:22:53 help
00:22:56 There's just a hundreds of thousands of hours of free tutorials
00:22:59 You just have to look through all of them and find out which one is actually going to tell you the right thing
00:23:05 I just have to freaking comb through thousands and thousands of advice threads on file stack or whatever
00:23:12 people asking how do I do this with my
00:23:17 You know what? I'm just probably gonna not do it
00:23:21 And I'm probably just gonna make the website simple
00:23:24 So you just click the archive and you can just see the list you can just see the list of episodes
00:23:32 Because it's easy um and um, um, what was I gonna say?
00:23:39 I I don't know
00:23:42 But yeah, that's that's I don't know when that's coming out from my give and take dot site relaunch
00:23:47 Uh when that comes out, I guess I'll be putting
00:23:50 Uh, my new Clarissa gunsmoke chapter on that
00:23:53 Hopefully before that that would be
00:23:57 With bscapades in the first perfect comic party
00:24:01 Uh
00:24:02 Zine
00:24:03 Zine
00:24:04 I I I just threw it. I just I just had to commit to something. I I couldn't think
00:24:10 Zine
00:24:12 You're a you're a I you're a I mean I mean you last week you said
00:24:17 Last week you said Zine. Well, that's how you know it's a fucking computer. That's how you know it's fucking fake
00:24:22 Is that it says things correctly? It's no
00:24:28 But oh, um the the guy who's building your website
00:24:33 I think we talked about I think I mentioned that like maybe he could build the pcp website and then I ended up just doing it myself
00:24:40 I think he was disappointed that I that I made the pcp website
00:24:44 myself because like
00:24:46 I I know I listen. I know he could have built a fancier website
00:24:50 I know he could have built a fancier website than I can
00:24:52 I'm sure he I'm sure of that
00:24:55 I just didn't want to
00:24:56 I just didn't want a fancy website
00:24:58 I just wanted some bullshit. That's what the pcp deserves
00:25:04 Uh
00:25:05 Just it's just a list of links if you go once then if you go to the new website
00:25:09 It's just a list of links that have the podcast
00:25:13 Yeah
00:25:14 It's just the the pcp website the new pcp website is just an answer to the question. Where's the podcast?
00:25:20 It's right there. It's all right there and that's all it is
00:25:24 And it's also some extra stuff
00:25:27 But uh, yeah, but yeah, the the perfect comic parties
00:25:34 magazine the magazine the perfect comic party zine is
00:25:39 um
00:25:40 In the works, I guess I'm waiting mostly on you to do some Biscopades
00:25:46 And then once that's done, we'll have our first issue
00:25:51 I mean
00:25:52 Wait a minute. Are you serious that like I just need to give you some pages and then it's like ready to go
00:25:57 Oh, no, but like I'm assuming the the amount of time it'll take for me to make the logo
00:26:02 Um and do other stuff will be uh equal or less than the time it'll take for you to do the Biscopades
00:26:11 Okay, I mean that's fair. Yeah, um, I don't know. I think I told you I told you before the show that I have not
00:26:19 I don't know. We thought we talked about scheduling. I know I have not been able to keep up with that schedule
00:26:25 I mean, there's a lot of stuff. I'm falling behind. That's fine. There's a lot of stuff happening right now, especially since the OVA is finished
00:26:32 Um, Radcom is taking like precedent in our minds to get that finally sorted out
00:26:38 Yeah, um perfect comic party
00:26:41 is
00:26:42 Cool, I like it. I like the idea. Yeah
00:26:47 and
00:26:48 Yeah, next week. I'm mostly going to be working on
00:26:51 Uh, the the logo for that the pdf and once I'm done with that, I guess I'll be working on chapter five of Clarissa
00:27:00 But then we're gonna we're gonna put it together. We're gonna make a little thing
00:27:04 And then you will be able to read it on the new website. Hopefully it will
00:27:09 It will be on the new website. Yeah, it will be on the new website. I I've made it so that it is like equally
00:27:16 Equally prominent
00:27:18 On the new website to the podcast. It has its own
00:27:23 It basically the the left side of is the podcast on the right side of the home page is the
00:27:28 It will be the perfect perfect comic party. Um, yeah, I have um
00:27:33 Um
00:27:35 What are we gonna do it needs like it's probably gonna need like a cover page
00:27:41 And it's probably a page of like
00:27:44 Thanks for reading. Here's some links to support us. Here's our patreon. Here's our ko-fi
00:27:49 Sure, sure. Yeah, and then and then a thank you page for patrons, right?
00:27:54 Yeah, yeah, yeah, so
00:27:57 um, oh, yeah, we haven't
00:27:59 I've I yeah the the idea of like a thank you like
00:28:03 Little you put names on the thing you put names on the content if you're a patron
00:28:08 Yeah, should we put every patron? I I think we should put like every five dollar patron. Okay
00:28:15 Yeah, so that's a five dollar reward tier on the patreon now
00:28:19 which we need to
00:28:21 We need to revamp that patron patron. There's lots of things like in the works to be like
00:28:27 Got done. So I'm not going to be like too worried if certain things get
00:28:34 Pushed back a bit
00:28:36 Yeah, I just want them to be done one after the other bit by bit things will be uploaded
00:28:43 Completed
00:28:44 of released and then
00:28:47 Like I don't know a little while
00:28:49 There'll be less bullshit
00:28:51 If we could just live
00:28:54 Live our stupid lives finally finally we can just live our stupid lives like we always wanted to
00:29:00 Uh, I have said
00:29:03 Some somehow this is all pushed
00:29:07 It really is like
00:29:10 There's a there is like a lot going on right now. I mean there's
00:29:15 The the the perfect comic party
00:29:18 Is a big thing that like I'm trying to get done and we're trying to do right now the new website
00:29:24 also coincidentally
00:29:26 Radcon stuff is finishing in the ova
00:29:29 also coincidentally
00:29:32 You know, well not coincidentally, but also the the dojin
00:29:34 I think like the printed the first printed copy of the dojin is like on its way
00:29:38 I think I might be getting it in the mail like today
00:29:41 But I'll have to check uh also
00:29:44 slime punishment
00:29:46 The first printed copies of slimes punishment are on their way
00:29:50 And they should be here maybe maybe this week
00:29:54 Um, did I talk about those? Did I show those? No, I think it was just this week that I got the the images
00:30:02 Right?
00:30:03 I was not I mean I can't remember on last episode if you talked about that
00:30:08 All right. No, no, I I think it I did not talk about no. I did not talk about it. Maybe I did. No, maybe I did talk
00:30:14 I don't
00:30:15 Help well, let me you talk to me about uh things you're doing in preparation for the video
00:30:21 Uh for the kicks data for the slime and punishment book
00:30:24 in the
00:30:25 In the in the st. Ben's cathedral discord for the cop killers
00:30:30 I posted in the announcements a picture of me
00:30:34 In the uh effect makeup just sitting there looking weird
00:30:39 And uh, it looks really funny
00:30:41 I just posted it was like so
00:30:45 Glowing um
00:30:48 Um, hang on I'll I'll check my discord because I posted
00:30:56 Uh, uh because I posted in the announcements
00:31:03 No, it was on the first yeah on march 1st. I got the first the pictures
00:31:08 Of slime and punishment
00:31:10 and
00:31:12 Should I
00:31:14 Should I post them?
00:31:16 I don't know I could I could repost them here
00:31:19 I don't know
00:31:21 Maybe it's too hard. Maybe it's too hard to copy paste a set of images. Yeah, you know what you know what I mean
00:31:26 Yeah
00:31:28 It's it's just so difficult
00:31:30 uh
00:31:32 Wait, I'll I'll do like two
00:31:34 There there's one
00:31:36 Nice thumb Ben
00:31:39 What nice thumb Ben. That's your thumb. That's my thumb
00:31:43 I think this is the lady. I think this is the lady that ghosted me and that I had the catfish
00:31:50 I mean, it could be someone else that works at the the company
00:31:53 Hey, look look look carefully at these two covers
00:31:57 Uh, you just you might be able to tell that they're slightly different like color
00:32:02 Oh, yeah, one of them is more vibrant
00:32:06 I the one on the left is like
00:32:09 Yellower and the one on the right is like
00:32:12 paler
00:32:13 The guru the greens you can if you look at the green of the text you can see the difference
00:32:18 Uh, yeah
00:32:18 If you look at the text you can see the different greens and if you look at endless war you can see on the left
00:32:22 His like shadowed side is like darker and on the right side. It's like brighter
00:32:27 So these are like the two different like filters that I use to adjust for the greens because I mean, you know from printing the red man comics
00:32:33 That when you try to print print print when you try to print
00:32:37 Like uh, like fully vibrant green. It turns to like mud, right? Yeah
00:32:42 So these are the two I don't have green and
00:32:45 in ink
00:32:46 And I think these came out pretty good. I'm not sure which I prefer but maybe when I when I have them in person
00:32:51 I will look at them and be like
00:32:54 Also also
00:32:56 This is really annoying
00:32:57 But the way that like the just the corner of endless war sticks over that like the like crease line at the spine
00:33:05 Uh, yeah, I see it really annoys me and I'll probably like nudge him over a little bit and like maybe try again
00:33:13 Just nudge him over a few millimeters just to just to have him not be creased like that because I don't like it
00:33:20 But yeah
00:33:21 There it there it is. That's what it's gonna look like
00:33:24 It's gonna get it real soon and then I'll do a
00:33:28 Freaking do want to do a freaking Kickstarter about it. Why don't you?
00:33:32 um
00:33:33 that'll
00:33:34 That'll have to come after probably after the the
00:33:38 Not I can't really even think about that until perfect comic party and um the website and the ova and stuff is all
00:33:46 taken care of
00:33:48 So many things on my plate
00:33:51 So many irons in that fire
00:33:53 I do have irons in the fire
00:33:56 I do
00:33:57 um
00:33:59 I've got so many as well. I've got like a big long list of things
00:34:02 Really more?
00:34:04 um
00:34:05 well, the the mostly like additional
00:34:09 Inc to like oh, I I need to think about I need to talk to that one guy about
00:34:15 like uh
00:34:17 if I can
00:34:19 Getting in a room with a fucking producer or something to talk about chlorissa potentially being something other than a comic
00:34:26 Like he's he was gonna talk to me about like
00:34:29 um, you've got a really good thing here
00:34:32 Talk to me. We'll we'll hash out like a pitch and you can we we can pitch it. I'm like, uh, okay
00:34:39 Uh, I don't know how to do that
00:34:41 And so that I got to look into that I got to ask him about that and then there's also
00:34:46 I should probably try to get some money for chlorissa because like I'm not getting money for it at the moment
00:34:52 So I was like what if I sell them?
00:34:55 On amazon, what if I have an amazon account? What if I go through all that?
00:34:59 And there's just like all these little things that will not take up that much time
00:35:04 by themselves
00:35:05 And just like yeah, yeah
00:35:07 My weeks are always packed with stuff
00:35:10 And I just kind of want to draw it kind of want to draw new chapters, but there's always all this marketing stuff
00:35:15 I got to do as well
00:35:18 I I feel like
00:35:22 You know
00:35:23 It's funny you say that because I really feel like
00:35:28 This this week especially but in in in
00:35:31 many recent weeks
00:35:34 Yeah, it's in spite of the fact that I have resolved to draw biscapades. I I feel like I have just had this never-ending
00:35:40 list of like the tasks that I that I have to do before I can actually get down
00:35:46 to do that
00:35:47 Uh, and I haven't done it yet and I just
00:35:50 It feels like the it feels like the
00:35:53 The things the things that I have to do around
00:35:56 that are just so
00:35:59 daunting and and numerous
00:36:02 Uh, that it has kept me from actually doing it
00:36:05 Uh, even though I guess it should be the point
00:36:08 The content should be the point
00:36:12 But it's not
00:36:15 Yeah, I don't know the best way to do like the balancing of stuff like that because
00:36:20 There's that thing they say
00:36:23 about like oh
00:36:25 You got to do the most important things in your life first because if you fill your life with
00:36:30 the the minutiae
00:36:32 Of everyday bullshit, you'll never like if you if you spend
00:36:38 If you if you answer all of your stupid emails first instead of following your passions
00:36:43 You'll never run out spend your whole you'll spend your whole life
00:36:47 Yeah, yeah, so like that's that's like a priorities thing. So like even though all these stupid emails will never stop piling up
00:36:55 That's that means you should let them sit let them
00:37:00 Let them rot I guess and focus instead on the more important stuff because the emails will still be there when you come back
00:37:06 and like
00:37:08 That's true of most of the time, which is why I'm trying to focus on the drawing but at the same time
00:37:14 Uh
00:37:16 It'll be good if though if people can buy Clarissa. I should really just get on that. I think I think that's just a good thing
00:37:23 uh, I think
00:37:26 You definitely have to answer some stupid emails. Yeah
00:37:30 Damn, you know, that's that's a
00:37:33 I've heard that's a good quote and uh now i'm wondering
00:37:38 If maybe I've been doing too much stupid email answering lately
00:37:44 Uh, might maybe probably because I haven't done any any drawing
00:37:49 ha ha
00:37:50 well, I mean
00:37:52 It sort of consumes you because it's always like yeah
00:37:56 It you you want this this a magical sort of there's nothing going on
00:38:01 sort of situation
00:38:03 um
00:38:04 And it never acts there's never there's never nothing going on it never. Yeah, there's never nothing going on
00:38:10 That's only when you're like three that that's the case
00:38:13 Yeah
00:38:14 Can't get it back. You can't play video games. I mean you can no, but like it's never gonna be. No, you're right
00:38:19 I can't I know more video games
00:38:23 I mean I have time for video games because I allocate time for no work
00:38:28 So I'm able to enjoy myself in the evenings
00:38:31 Right, I think is doing a lot good for me because it allows me to like
00:38:36 Constantly be making progress every week
00:38:39 Um with like a plan of action that I write on Friday after I finished work like okay next week
00:38:45 this coming week, I'm like
00:38:47 Do the fucking logo then do the pdf get all that ready
00:38:52 for a perfect comic party and then
00:38:54 Only once those things are done. I can start drawing Clarissa Gunsmoke during the remaining workouts of the week
00:39:01 And then I know what I'll be doing on Monday. So it's like
00:39:05 and then I have time to enjoy fucking around
00:39:08 On every day as well. So it's like
00:39:11 It's time
00:39:12 Management it's good
00:39:14 That's nice. That's nice. I mean, I guess it's working for you. Yeah, you're getting
00:39:19 You're getting work done, which is really nice
00:39:22 uh
00:39:24 I mean I get to play video games. I do get to play video games on twitch.tv slash st comics
00:39:30 battle network
00:39:31 So
00:39:32 Yes, I do have play some video games. You know what?
00:39:35 I'm actually really liking
00:39:38 battle network two
00:39:39 a lot
00:39:41 Battle network one was kind of frustrating
00:39:44 battle network two is like a much they like
00:39:47 It's basically the same game
00:39:49 But they just like were a lot more like deliberate in how they like balanced it and executed it in a way that is just like a lot more
00:39:57 fun
00:39:59 If what I mean
00:40:02 Okay, do they still have random battles?
00:40:05 There are random battles, but they're I feel like they're less frequent
00:40:10 And the battles are more
00:40:13 Well, I what I mean the battles are mostly the same
00:40:16 I feel I feel like there's less of them per like time spent walking
00:40:21 and
00:40:22 uh
00:40:23 Here's the one of the most important things is like
00:40:26 in battle network
00:40:28 One like the core conceded the core concept of the bat the combat is that you have
00:40:33 This like deck of chips that you can use a certain amount of and if you have chips that are the same like
00:40:41 They can either be the same type or they can have like the same like code letter on them
00:40:45 And if either one of those you can match and you can use multiple at the same time sort of like uno or whatever
00:40:52 So
00:40:55 And if you have certain very specific combinations of them you can you can use like a super attack, right?
00:41:01 In the playing through the entirety of the first game. I use
00:41:05 One super attack ever it only ever happened one time
00:41:09 Uh, I've already had it happen once
00:41:13 Uh, and I'm not even I'm not I'm like only like a third or the way through two
00:41:18 And also
00:41:19 It just feels like I'm actually using the combos more like there were I never used like combos in the first game
00:41:27 I just
00:41:28 if
00:41:29 Playing through the second game. I'm finding cards and I'm actually having like oh
00:41:34 This card would go with those two like this card has a letter matching these two. I can use that that makes it useful
00:41:39 They also introduce a thing and two where certain cards are like no letter and no letter cards can be basically matched with
00:41:46 As long as you have only one other letter in your in your stack you can match a no letter card with them
00:41:52 It's like a wild card
00:41:54 So even if you have no matches if you have an asterisk you can use one plus an asterisk
00:41:58 So you it's just more it's just more possible to to think about like which cards do I want to use?
00:42:05 together
00:42:06 And there are now cards that modify other cards and stuff
00:42:10 and it's like they really
00:42:13 Took the first game, but they did it good
00:42:16 the second time
00:42:18 Uh, and it's fun. It's cool. I'm liking it more than I expected to
00:42:22 That's good. How long did the first game take then to complete?
00:42:27 I think it took me roughly like 20 hours total. Okay
00:42:31 And I think the second one's probably gonna be similar
00:42:35 I can't remember how many
00:42:37 How many hours I've played like the fire emblem first game
00:42:41 It's like I missed I missed your stream yesterday. It was in the morning and I was asleep. I I think I should stream
00:42:48 Later because I I enjoy
00:42:51 Streaming during the day because it's like, I don't know
00:42:54 Nothing really going on. It's just a lazy weekend. Whatever. Yeah, but um
00:42:59 Nobody's around so I should probably stream later
00:43:02 on Saturday. I think that on
00:43:05 Friday I should stream earlier because the stream my my
00:43:10 On this Friday. I had like a pretty good stream. My my my stream was kind of I mean, you know
00:43:17 Wasn't I wouldn't pop it popping off would be an exaggeration, but it felt like it was popping off
00:43:21 It had it had more people in there
00:43:24 For me and I I was really high energy
00:43:28 I was people in the in the chat were saying like
00:43:31 What is that? What is this like energetic been like? What is this like hyperben?
00:43:35 I was I was uh, I was going off
00:43:38 and
00:43:39 But like a viewership really started to tank at the end and I think it's just because it got really late
00:43:44 And you know, especially like especially people in europe were like, well, I gotta go to bed, you know
00:43:48 It's freaking like one in the morning here
00:43:52 So, uh, I'm probably I'm gonna try to try and start streaming maybe around like I've been starting maybe around like six
00:43:58 Maybe I'll try and start around like four
00:44:00 Or something
00:44:02 Uh, yeah
00:44:06 I was I was I was
00:44:11 I don't think
00:44:13 I don't know if you I don't know if I should say why I was so energized
00:44:17 In the chat on Friday
00:44:19 There was there was drama happening
00:44:22 There was there was there was there was there was fighting occurring and I won't I won't go into the details about it
00:44:28 uh
00:44:29 But I was mad
00:44:31 and I was uh
00:44:33 And I was going off about it on my stream
00:44:37 Uh, because I love gossip
00:44:41 Uh
00:44:44 What else are we talking about that's twitch.tv slash st comics twitch.tv slash
00:44:49 Hippocrite or the give and take give and take dammit. Ha ha. I never had a hippocrite twitch
00:44:57 Uh
00:44:58 Right, right
00:45:00 Actually, I don't remember when or why I made a twitch account
00:45:05 Well, obviously the stream but like I don't remember for what game. I don't really remember
00:45:11 I don't really remember making tea bath. Didn't you on twitch?
00:45:14 Right
00:45:17 Maybe but I don't think we ever used it
00:45:21 I think we probably we probably did have an account
00:45:24 I remember because you you have an account that like I followed
00:45:29 Or something
00:45:30 twitch.tv let me let me look twitch.tv slash
00:45:34 tbbb ap
00:45:38 There is a tbap
00:45:40 Do we have any videos? No, there are no videos on the tbap twitch account
00:45:47 Maybe just like a parking on that space in case there was another tbbb ap it was trying to muscle in
00:45:54 Oh, the the description on it is tbap who's ready for some shit art
00:46:02 I guess I was intending to to do draw streams
00:46:05 Oh, that probably would be it
00:46:08 I think I was probably
00:46:09 That's really funny. I must have been intending to like draw like phantom horn comics
00:46:14 And then I did draw phantom horn comics and it's called slime and punishment coming soon
00:46:19 But I didn't stream it
00:46:20 Uh, I was struggling
00:46:23 I was really struggling because I wanted to raid somebody
00:46:27 And while I while I was while I was streaming
00:46:31 Uh hazel was live and I wanted to stream her but then she quit right before I was done
00:46:36 Action button was live. I wanted to raid him. He quit right before I was done. I think I ended up raiding. I ended up raiding, um
00:46:44 jonan vasquez
00:46:47 Who is not huge on twitch. I think maybe like 70 people were watching him
00:46:51 so
00:46:52 I got a shout out from
00:46:54 from xanen v
00:46:56 On twitch was was kind of fun
00:46:58 Uh, I keep forgetting the raid function exists by the time I'm finished with the stream. I'm like, uh, I'm tired. All right. See you
00:47:05 Yeah, I mean me too. And that's why I was like, well, I gotta raid someone
00:47:09 I gotta raid someone because like you literally there's no reason not to freaking raid someone
00:47:14 at the end of your stream
00:47:16 That's just the habit I want to get into
00:47:19 Who is it who the uh, sometimes I see cyber shell streaming
00:47:24 Sometimes cyber shell streaming see hazel streaming. I was surprised to see action button streaming
00:47:29 Uh, and those are all people that I think it would be funny to raid
00:47:34 uh, but
00:47:35 I'm all I all my streams go too long and they always end before I do
00:47:40 Because I usually stream for like five hours
00:47:42 I think I'm going to try to keep them shorter because it was pointed out in my chat and I looked at the analytics and it's mostly true
00:47:49 I think my stream viewership tends to usually go for about like three hours and then it like tapers off
00:47:55 and I'm not sure if that's
00:47:56 Just like the natural lifespan of a stream or if maybe like I start to lose my
00:48:01 My focus or my enthusiasm my energy around that time and people start dropping off
00:48:06 Because I was really energized for a while and then I eventually I was like, all right. Let's all right
00:48:10 Let's just talk about the game and then I kind of
00:48:13 Yeah, and then you know that was around three hours in and then uh, I guess less
00:48:18 Viewers started to drop off. It depends on
00:48:22 Like international appeal, I suppose but also the time you start
00:48:26 Because like germa
00:48:28 Is my favorite streamer. He sometimes will get obsessed with a game and go for 11 hours
00:48:34 Only are very occasionally. I mean like hit this stream is still buzzing. I don't think it drops off
00:48:40 That significantly
00:48:43 Maybe it does maybe it doesn't it's just always people there. So it doesn't feel like it's like dead
00:48:49 Wouldn't wouldn't know
00:48:52 Yeah, I think probably when a when a stream is popular and a lot of people are watching and the chat is going like mile a minute
00:49:00 probably less people
00:49:02 Probably that means this makes a smaller percentage of the viewership actually be typing
00:49:08 Because more of them are like well my message wouldn't even get seen because the chat's moving so fast
00:49:13 Uh
00:49:19 Well, uh
00:49:22 All right
00:49:24 Ben have you seen the anime revolutionary girl utena?
00:49:29 No, I've never watched it
00:49:31 I've begun watching revolutionary girl utena in my off time and it is very good show
00:49:37 Oh
00:49:40 I remember it being the one I would watch I've heard a lot about it. Yeah, it's like swords and dueling
00:49:46 and
00:49:47 Utena is this pink haired
00:49:50 Girl who dresses like a prince
00:49:53 She she was saved by a prince or like she
00:49:57 Prince found her when she was very young gave her a ring
00:50:01 And he said oh don't cry uh, whatever and then he left and she was like, ah
00:50:07 This guy's so cool. I'm gonna be a prince when I grow up and then she has a sword and it's cool
00:50:12 Oh
00:50:13 gender
00:50:15 Gender ha ha lesbianism
00:50:19 That's wait wait that reminds me of
00:50:22 What does that remind me of
00:50:25 What did you say gender?
00:50:27 No, I mean that was h bomber guy
00:50:30 Um, no brand brand of tarth. I think I'm thinking of brand of tarth
00:50:35 From game of thrones, you know, yes. Yes. Oh, yeah, you see you're you're a
00:50:40 I'm a throner. You're a throne a throner
00:50:43 Um, I'm a throne head. You're a throne like the the angel with the eyes
00:50:49 You know about thrones
00:50:51 Uh, you ever you ever see you ever see that biblically accurate angel. That's like a big wheel of eyes
00:50:57 Yes, well, I haven't I haven't seen it in real life. You ever seen it in real life. That's that's a throne
00:51:04 aka a throne rug aka an ophanim
00:51:09 Because uh, it's called that because in like the book of ezekiel or inok or something
00:51:13 There's like someone sees the throne of god and like it's like four of these like these four like eye wheels are like wheels
00:51:20 Are like carrying him around or something
00:51:23 They're looking in every direction
00:51:25 Literally true
00:51:27 literally true
00:51:29 Although nowadays there'd be like 360 cameras nowadays
00:51:33 Nowadays those things have a million eyes and 900,000 of them would be woke
00:51:41 Open your eyes. I can't believe
00:51:44 Wokeness has gone so far that even the even the very throne of god himself has been
00:51:50 wokified
00:51:52 gotta
00:51:54 You've got to stop teaching this in schools, man
00:51:57 Um, like like like a conservative like filming on their phone like looking at god
00:52:03 Yeah, like feeling god like I can't believe god is woke. You could believe what has happened
00:52:07 God yeah, good god appears before them on his on his throne and like the freaking seraphim spread their like giant like
00:52:15 There's six like rainbow colored wings and they're just like, oh, I can you believe this?
00:52:19 Can you see the grooming they're grooming our they're grooming the spirits of our dead
00:52:24 They're grooming the spirits of our hallowed dead and the saints
00:52:28 That's in the saints that sing god's praises. They're being there's teaching crt
00:52:33 The holy ghost is teaching it
00:52:38 What are we gonna do to vote against this? Yeah
00:52:41 anyway, utena is great
00:52:43 and uh, I
00:52:45 remember
00:52:46 The one of the one of the first pcp arguments. This is a nostalgia bombshell. I remember this one
00:52:52 Do you remember when exactly we were talking about the steven universe clip of pearl doing that famous
00:52:58 Lunge into the camera
00:53:00 Action shot. Yes, and it being like, ah, you know what's so cool about that
00:53:05 It's a reference to a revolutionary girl utena and I watched the show and I got to that part and I was like, oh
00:53:10 It's just like steven universe. It's just like steven
00:53:13 Yeah, yeah, and I think didn't me and jeff poo argue
00:53:18 That was an epic jeff was on that episode
00:53:21 Wow, and someone was arguing with me and I said
00:53:24 homage is always inferior to the original
00:53:28 And someone was like, no, it's not and I don't remember if jeff was on my side
00:53:33 Or not. I think I think uh, trixie and jesse were there and I do remember
00:53:39 I do remember it being a big argument that we never remember being there
00:53:43 I don't think I said much on that specifically
00:53:46 Yeah, yeah, it was it was an interesting idea like
00:53:50 Like a reference
00:53:54 I kind of remember like references are always lesser than the original even if the original
00:54:00 Sometimes is bad just by itself
00:54:03 Yeah, I think that was my position
00:54:06 But it turns out the utena usage of it is better. I like it much more
00:54:10 Because utena it looks so fucking cool
00:54:12 Her her like princely she she wears like a boy's school uniform, but it's not like the other boys of the school
00:54:18 Um, it's like black. Oh, she's like will smith
00:54:21 She's like will smith who wears her who wears the his uh, his his school uniform jacket inside out to show the floral pattern
00:54:29 Yeah
00:54:30 Yeah, it's just like that
00:54:32 um
00:54:33 and uh
00:54:35 Yeah, the
00:54:37 It's like a really cool outfit and then when she goes to do a duel with swords
00:54:42 She walks up this long spiral staircase and there's like metal music playing
00:54:47 like like
00:54:48 It's metal, but there's like anime high-pitched ladies singing like absolute
00:54:55 devastation
00:54:56 Uh abyss and stuff and it's like
00:54:59 It's so like
00:55:02 So metal it's so cool
00:55:05 And they they go to this big huge area looks like a kingdom hearts level boss area
00:55:11 And she does a sword duel and she does that that lunge attack a couple times. There's a bits of
00:55:17 recycled animation, but the animation
00:55:20 Like generally across all of the battles is like really solid
00:55:24 Every time there's a new duel there's a new like set of like really cool cuts
00:55:28 Who is she dueling like other students?
00:55:32 Other students members of like the student council
00:55:36 Of the high school, you know, it's a classic like ha ha anime, but like what if it's school and
00:55:41 Things that are not associated with school for real
00:55:44 Um, is it like a mystic mysticism and like weird magic that is a little bit like the clubs
00:55:50 Is it a little bit like the clubs in kill a kill?
00:55:54 Not I don't think there's like underlings or anything. It's just like these individuals
00:55:59 Who are part of the student student council?
00:56:01 And then there's all of the rest of the students who are like oblivious to all the sword dueling
00:56:06 That's doing their thing
00:56:09 Uh, but like
00:56:11 It's great. I really like the show. I would recommend that you watch that one
00:56:18 Okay, it sounds pretty cool actually
00:56:21 It sounds it sounds like it might be good. Maybe I would watch it
00:56:25 Maybe how many episodes is it long? Uh, it's like 30 episodes 31. Oh, that's nothing. So like a couple seasons
00:56:34 And i'm already on episode like 15
00:56:39 No, wait, maybe it's more than 30. Maybe it's like 38 I can't remember but uh, it's nice
00:56:47 It's nice and it's not
00:56:49 It's not like um
00:56:52 It's it's odd because it's such a serious
00:56:56 feeling show with like the imagery of the roses and the
00:57:01 The gothic sort of architecture and the sword fighting and the princely princes and princesses and the sort of mystical
00:57:08 weird stuff
00:57:10 But then occasionally there's an episode that's like a complete farce a complete joke
00:57:15 Uh, where nanami who is my favorite character?
00:57:19 Who is like the bitchy horrible
00:57:22 Uh, you know high school girl mean girl
00:57:24 But she's also like the the pret full comic relief character who constantly is a complete idiot and gets beat up a lot
00:57:32 And there's just like an episode centered around her will be like
00:57:36 Like her treating someone like shit and then getting comeuppance in the form of a kangaroo with boxing gloves coming to beat everyone up
00:57:44 It's just a kangaroo. There's no explanation of the kangaroo, but it's there for like
00:57:50 like
00:57:51 I don't know
00:57:52 It's it's such a weird vibe that it strikes where it's so silly
00:57:56 And so serious, you know, I I feel like
00:58:00 I said I've never seen it and I've only heard it talked about and yeah, I couldn't really have told you what john
00:58:05 I mean, I guess I thought that it was a
00:58:08 romance with like
00:58:10 action
00:58:11 There's romantic stuff and there is that action, but it's not like a it's not
00:58:16 Serious, which is nice. I didn't want it to be like
00:58:20 Like super emotional and serious the whole time. Yeah, I like that. It's goofy sometimes
00:58:26 There's like a little mascot character. That's like a little chubby
00:58:29 A little chibi chubby, uh, monkey. That's the size of like a chibi chubby monkey minky
00:58:35 Yeah, a little chubby chubby monkey minky is like the size of like a a grapefruit and he's always doing something silly
00:58:42 and uh
00:58:44 him a
00:58:45 aunty aunty
00:58:46 the princess looking
00:58:49 to to utena's prince
00:58:51 is uh
00:58:52 she's
00:58:54 She's kind of a fucking weirdo
00:58:56 She's like a nice girl, but she's kind of like really autistic and laughs at stupid shit and nobody knows what the hell she's doing
00:59:05 It's kind of it's it's endearing in a weird way. There was this part where
00:59:10 She was like there was a serious conversation going on between utena and someone else
00:59:14 and uh aunty was
00:59:17 Um, you know, she was there, but she wasn't really listening and then she was making a flip book
00:59:23 Uh using the pages of our math textbook and then she was flipping through it
00:59:26 And the scene ends when she just bursts out laughing flipping through the pages and they look at her and like what?
00:59:32 What are you laughing at and she just kind of stopped laughing and they cut to the next scene
00:59:36 She's just kind of a freak
00:59:38 Yeah, I love it. Hmm. I like freaks
00:59:43 Uh, man original. Yeah 39 episodes original run 1997
00:59:49 man
00:59:51 I would have been a tiny person
00:59:53 I wouldn't have been that tiny. I guess I would have been nine
00:59:56 I'm just shit. I mean
00:59:59 I feel old now. No that a that the anime is ancient, but I'm even more so
01:00:05 I guess I'm gonna come years ago is 97
01:00:08 the
01:00:11 20
01:00:13 26
01:00:15 Yes
01:00:18 Wow
01:00:22 I'm a relic and I'm a relic it's over
01:00:25 So it's so over. It's never been more over than it is right now
01:00:30 You know, if you're an age of empires too, you would generate gold
01:00:36 If you're a relic
01:00:38 Damn, I guess I'm not a relic then because if you were placed in a monastery, you would generate gold because I'm definitely not generating the gold right now
01:00:51 And I'm definitely not at a monastery
01:00:54 Um
01:00:56 Radcon five at a monastery
01:00:59 We'll generate gold rad cut live
01:01:02 To rad we'll go to the priory
01:01:05 We'll go to the priory in real life radcon five
01:01:08 Yeah, vote should we go and protect democracy in the ukraine?
01:01:11 Or should we take a vow of monasticism and become monks in the in the real life priory?
01:01:18 and uh
01:01:19 And generate and generate gold
01:01:22 Generate gold for our team
01:01:24 Radcon five just generate just be just taking a vow of poverty taking a vow of silence
01:01:30 And getting on stream get and generating gold
01:01:33 Yo, yo, hit the dono link to generate some gold and then we have like we have the the twitch the twitch cup
01:01:39 It's just like full of gold coins
01:01:43 I don't think of like a bunch of monks at a monastery, but they all have their own like
01:01:48 streamer rig
01:01:50 So they can like live stream them praying or something. I
01:01:53 I know that like, uh, I know people live stream like church masses
01:01:59 Uh, I wonder if there's any like
01:02:02 I
01:02:04 I bet there are probably monks that stream on twitch
01:02:08 I bet there I bet there probably is at least one. Hang on
01:02:11 I mean the only monks that are really relevant
01:02:16 In terms of like having existence is like
01:02:20 Tibetan monks or like buddhist monks and they don't do technology
01:02:24 as much as they can
01:02:26 the like christian monks
01:02:29 Exist in the same way that we think of them
01:02:34 Well, I mean those are both
01:02:37 I was talking about like like western christian monks
01:02:41 Sure, but like I thought you're at your I guess I don't know what the the the the monk like title is about
01:02:50 Because I don't think I've ever met a person who was a monk or even known of a person who was a monk
01:02:54 I've known people who are priests
01:02:57 or vicars
01:02:59 Vickers are more common. Okay, they're
01:03:03 Okay, I think I've heard of this guy dr. K
01:03:06 That does it ring a bell?
01:03:08 Yeah, health health. Yeah. Yeah, it's the healthy gamer healthy gamer gg
01:03:13 That guy healthy. I mean, I think he's an x-munk. I think he's a former monk who became like a psychiatrist
01:03:20 So I don't know if that really counts. I'm just trying to go like active monks
01:03:23 Go to twitch.tv slash for active monks active monk
01:03:28 Uh, well, I mean this youtube channel calls how a game addicted monk became twitch's go-to therapist
01:03:35 But no, I'm talking about like someone like streaming live from the monastery
01:03:39 I mean, it's hard because when you search monk you find like
01:03:43 Video game monks like like d&d. Yeah
01:03:46 Fucking runescape monk
01:03:50 Well, you know, I bet I bet it's a thing. I bet it is a real thing, but it's probably they're probably not gaming
01:03:56 They're probably not generating gold. They're probably well, I mean, it's maybe if there's a really popular one
01:04:03 um
01:04:05 I wonder if maybe some do it and like give like
01:04:09 religious advice or something. Maybe they have like just a just chatting like
01:04:13 Yeah, you know talk to this really popular monk and he'll tell you about
01:04:18 What god wants you to do in your marriage or whatever. I guess that's probably more of a priest thing than a monk thing
01:04:23 Yeah, I think monk is like a lower level
01:04:27 What is a monk is basically just a freaking like a priest in training
01:04:32 I always thought of it as like like if they are historically like medieval or whatever
01:04:37 The monks would go to practice praying and discipline in the churches and the monasteries and the priories
01:04:44 um, and then rise the ranks
01:04:46 But they would mostly be there as like servants for the older
01:04:50 members of the church who didn't want to clean the floors and and the toilets and make all the food
01:04:56 A monastery is not is not a church
01:05:00 I think that a monastery. I mean it might have a church in it, but I think a monastery is basically just like a dormitory
01:05:07 where monks
01:05:08 Just live and and do I think it's like a freaking
01:05:12 Work camp basically
01:05:15 It's a little town religiously themed. It's a place where you
01:05:19 Go or are sent to just live there
01:05:23 And when you live there as a monk, you know you abide by these monkish rules
01:05:29 And and probably a lot of them do eventually become
01:05:32 priests or take on other like
01:05:35 roles in the church, but like not I don't think necessarily you're like
01:05:40 Oh, I'm putting in my my obligatory service hours as a monk before I
01:05:45 graduate I mean think some of them do probably do that
01:05:49 But probably not all
01:05:52 damn
01:05:54 That's just I just had a thought that like what if I was a monk
01:05:58 But I was just like a kind of a shitty one and I just like never
01:06:03 I just stayed a monk my whole life
01:06:05 probably would too
01:06:06 I probably would have no outstanding qualities and I would just I would just never graduate from monkhood. I would probably just uh
01:06:14 I would probably just be making cheese wheels my whole life
01:06:17 Maybe maybe they would put me on duty illuminating some manuscripts if I was lucky
01:06:23 But I wouldn't be like the the guy who illuminates manuscripts. I would just be like an apprentice
01:06:28 Someone else would probably be better at illuminating those manuscripts than me
01:06:32 I don't know. I don't think I don't think I would have cut it
01:06:35 I don't think I would have cut it as a monk
01:06:37 Just imagine that being like you say that as you're like
01:06:41 Like hunched over and just kicking a rock
01:06:44 You know in the monastery courtyard like yeah, I'll never be the guy who illuminates the manuscripts
01:06:51 I mean I've practiced some illuminations on my own parchment, but uh, it's just not
01:06:56 It's just not that impressive. I just don't know what it takes
01:07:01 Well, these other guys they thank god comes to them all the time. It's just like he doesn't come to me that much
01:07:09 You know what I mean by illuminating manuscripts, right?
01:07:12 Uh, like illumination entertainment the minion animation studio. That's that's it. It literally means illustrating
01:07:19 That's what you call it when like a big fancy old medieval text has like freaking like a big fancy letter and like like little drawings in the margins and stuff
01:07:28 Like that's an illuminated manuscript. It's illuminated in the sense that yeah, you've drawn little pictures on it
01:07:37 So, okay, what is ilu then like there's illusion there's
01:07:43 There's illuminate and there's illustration
01:07:47 What's ilu? It's like a fucking Latin word. It probably means to show or to reveal
01:07:53 Or maybe to see
01:07:55 Yeah, illuminated manuscript is formally prepared document where the text is supplemented with flourishes such as borders and miniature illustrations
01:08:03 Uh
01:08:05 Illusion etymology
01:08:08 illustrary illustrary
01:08:12 late middle english
01:08:14 Illumination spiritual or intellectual enlightenment
01:08:18 What do you mean? What does it mean?
01:08:21 Where's the first one? It means light. Okay
01:08:25 Illuminates from the verb illuminari from in upon and lumen
01:08:31 Lumen or lumen means light and in so so
01:08:36 In light so light
01:08:38 in
01:08:40 You light upon you put you shed light upon it
01:08:46 That's why like reading something can be illuminating for your mind, I guess
01:08:50 Yeah, it's it's illuminating and that it lights it up
01:08:59 So light being
01:09:01 Not physical light necessarily
01:09:04 Yeah, I guess light has a lot of of connotations of
01:09:08 like
01:09:09 spiritual and
01:09:11 intellectual like
01:09:13 I see the light. I get it light bulb goes off my head and I understand
01:09:18 My brain is on fire right now
01:09:23 Um, I think I think that in old in middle english and latin
01:09:28 As today. Yeah to illuminate something
01:09:32 To give put light on something had had metaphorical
01:09:36 meaning in the sense that it also
01:09:38 It all to reveals something or um
01:09:43 Maybe just uh
01:09:46 It what's the enhances or uh
01:09:49 uh
01:09:50 I mean when you're illustrating something you're illuminating in the sense and that you're like brightening it up
01:09:56 It could mean that it's like brightening it up like making it nicer and illuminating it in that sense
01:10:00 Or it could mean and because it's in like this monastic context
01:10:04 It could mean
01:10:06 Something like yeah, you're shedding the light of god upon it because the what you're the decorations and the illustrations are divinely
01:10:13 Inspired maybe
01:10:17 Light has a lot of fucking history around it light does
01:10:21 the word
01:10:23 It's as old as the universe actually I guess I suppose so
01:10:28 it's just funny how like
01:10:30 I think of light mostly is like. Oh, yes photons
01:10:35 You know
01:10:36 Or like something isn't heavy right
01:10:39 But then of all these all these things that it
01:10:42 Historically refers to a little different. I was talking um
01:10:49 Long time ago probably maybe months ago in my discord about like
01:10:54 Uh, how you would go about
01:10:57 Acquiring how would you how would you go about uh, basically doing dyson sphere stuff to like acquire solar energy more efficiently?
01:11:07 And uh, we were just we were talking about like
01:11:12 Uh, okay. You mean you know what a Dyson spirit?
01:11:16 Uh, it's a star trek idea
01:11:18 More or less. Yeah, where you use
01:11:23 You build a structure around a sun to harvest its energy. Yeah, uh to I don't know shoot lasers or whatever or whatever
01:11:32 yeah, uh, so like
01:11:35 The building like a solid sphere would be really hard
01:11:40 But what you could almost just what you could also do
01:11:44 Is you could build just a ring around it and like then the the ring would also catch the light
01:11:50 You know not as much as the sphere, but you know, it's a start or you could instead of putting building a solid object around it
01:11:56 You could just put like a like a swarm of like small orbiting bodies and like a big cloud around it
01:12:04 That would orbit it and like little little solar panels that would also
01:12:08 absorb the light and the idea then
01:12:11 Would be well if we want to use that energy on earth, it would have to
01:12:16 somehow transmit that energy back to earth
01:12:18 So you would have a huge swarm maybe in a ring shape around the sun of these
01:12:24 Uh panels and they would be catching the solar energy and then they would have to somehow
01:12:29 Transmit the energy back to earth and I feel like the easiest way to do that would be like
01:12:35 A laser they would have to fire a laser
01:12:37 at earth
01:12:39 Towards maybe like a satellite that was in space over the earth that would have some sort of receiving
01:12:45 a photoreceptor that could absorb the energy from
01:12:50 The lasers that the these photo or these solar
01:12:54 receptacles would be firing at it
01:12:57 And I was thinking okay
01:12:59 Well, is it feasible?
01:13:01 To is it feasible to have a laser that travels that far like basically from the sun to the earth?
01:13:09 uh and like
01:13:11 stays
01:13:13 As a coherent beam
01:13:15 You know because lasers are not like perfectly parallel like they do sort of widen as they travel
01:13:21 And I don't know I I crunched some numbers really quick and I like I looked up some
01:13:26 There because okay, there's a thing where like the the the beam is a parallel beam
01:13:30 But it's also a wave and so like there's no
01:13:33 There's no way to construct a laser where the lines go perfectly parallel and they stay perfectly parallel forever
01:13:39 And the rate at which the like the widening of the wave sort of happens
01:13:43 It depends on a bunch of things it depends on like the original aperture that it's fired from
01:13:48 And it depends on the the the the wavelength of the laser
01:13:53 photon
01:13:55 And I did some and I did some crunch some numbers around and I ended up coming up with the result that yeah
01:14:00 If you use like a very high like ultraviolet
01:14:03 wavelength laser
01:14:05 Yeah, you could fire a beam from the sun to the earth and you could
01:14:10 You could keep a beam diffusion down
01:14:14 And I think the result that I came up with was that you could probably do it
01:14:18 And it wouldn't you you could without the beam spreading over more than maybe like a couple meters wide
01:14:24 So you could in theory have
01:14:26 A beam and you could have a satellite in the in the sky
01:14:29 Up in space that would have a big photo receiver
01:14:32 And I feel like the receiver could maybe just be a few meters wide and that would be enough to like okay
01:14:38 The the beams are still getting into it and I was like hmm. That's kind of sounds
01:14:43 Pretty feasible. I don't know that that doesn't sound that crazy actually
01:14:47 And then the satellite will take the laser and convert it into battery energy and then shoot batteries down at earth
01:14:54 It's like it's like pooping a stream of batteries down
01:14:58 Yeah, little tiny little AA batteries and then like and then like poor disenfranchised children from third world countries
01:15:04 Will go and like stand with like woven baskets around where they know like oh here every day at 3 p.m
01:15:10 Like the the battery like the the AA battery boy come just come careening down from space
01:15:19 Shattering bones
01:15:25 Yep, that's right. That's right
01:15:28 I mean, I think that I think that then probably uh, you would probably have it would fire another laser
01:15:34 Through the atmosphere that would probably have to be received on the ground somewhere
01:15:38 Yeah, and you would lose some energy there to like atmospheric diffusion or whatever dispersal, but like, you know
01:15:46 How much of the sun's energy are you blocking from reaching earth normally?
01:15:51 I mean not not most of it
01:15:54 the sum
01:15:56 The sum
01:15:57 But that's okay. I mean, it's got to get here somehow. You got it. You got to deal with area. I mean we could build it
01:16:02 We could build a cord
01:16:04 Could we run a cord like an electrical cable from like a satellite in space
01:16:09 To earth to transmit like electrical energy
01:16:13 Where would you plug it in it would be constantly spinning around the earth? No, no not necessarily because you you can um
01:16:21 You can set up a satellite to orbit in lockstep with the earth's rotation so that the satellite stays directly above
01:16:29 a specific spot
01:16:31 I would say then that it's likely that a cord of that length would be so heavy that it would pull the satellite to the ground
01:16:42 Like it would be it would need to be
01:16:44 so far away
01:16:46 That enough of the cord is in the vacuum of space so that it's not being pulled to earth
01:16:52 I think you could probably account
01:16:55 For like, yeah the gravity of the cord. I think you could probably account for that in in like the the satellites
01:17:03 orbital momentum or something
01:17:06 I think you
01:17:08 I don't know
01:17:11 I think you could do it but I sort of thing that
01:17:13 Like a kid would think oh, why don't you just have
01:17:16 You know a really really tall thing. Why really really long wire. Just want you to make a really long wire
01:17:22 Why can't you build a tower that just keeps going up and up and up? It's because the weight of the thing
01:17:26 It's it's not really that intuitive
01:17:29 But like the weight of the thing as it gets taller is so much that it would crumple it would pull itself back to earth
01:17:35 You would need so much support or it would need to be
01:17:39 so tightly
01:17:40 Like it would be you need to be so I don't know
01:17:44 There's no drag in space. So it's not like air resistance is going to be a factor
01:17:48 No, no, because the court's not moving if you have a if you have a synchronous
01:17:52 Satellite in a satellite in synchronous orbit with the earth's rotation. The the cord wouldn't really be moving
01:17:57 So once it's up there, it wouldn't have to deal with drag
01:18:00 There would be a lot of cord that was like
01:18:04 Yeah, it would be going up for miles and miles and miles and yeah, it would be heavy
01:18:10 Maybe you'd have to like start the cord at the satellite and then lower it down
01:18:15 Yeah, you could do it that way
01:18:18 I
01:18:21 You know, it might be one of those things that like
01:18:24 Theoretically you could do it but like in practice. Yeah, like like the the pull of the cord would just be like the satellite
01:18:31 It's unreasonable to think that the satellite would be unaffected by
01:18:35 Yeah wind forces
01:18:38 And whatever else
01:18:40 That might affect
01:18:43 That might just be too disruptive to like a stable orbit
01:18:46 It would be funny though. What if a little little space mouse and short chews through the cord
01:18:51 Space mouse
01:18:53 Little space mouse is like right at the edge of the the atmosphere and he goes no
01:18:59 Yeah, yeah, they would have to watch out for that. They would definitely have to watch out for that. Oh
01:19:05 um
01:19:06 Shit wait, I want to take a picture of something. Give me give me one second. I'll be right back
01:19:12 Oh, no, no another dick pics
01:19:16 He didn't hear that a few moments later
01:19:42 Oh
01:20:02 My homey. Oh homey. It's me March
01:20:07 March, it's me
01:20:12 Oh, it's me March and this is what I say
01:20:16 Oh homey. Why did you have to kill Bart?
01:20:22 I was working on making him
01:20:24 The bestest son there ever was you just killed him. What are we gonna do homey?
01:20:31 What are we gonna do? All right, shut up March?
01:20:36 Dad's back from the plant
01:20:38 and uh
01:20:40 All right, so here's my here's my setup right now
01:20:45 Uh, this is like
01:20:47 This is this is how it's progressed
01:20:51 So basically uh on the left you have
01:20:55 the the original
01:20:57 tonic
01:20:58 that I boiled down
01:21:00 The the the diet tonic that I boiled down
01:21:04 Uh really really far and I let it sit and it eventually sort of congealed into a puck
01:21:09 So what I did to all these is I added alcohol to them. I just added like pure like isopropyl alcohol
01:21:16 And then in the middle
01:21:18 Is the one that I added baking soda to to neutralize the acid and it turned it green and it like made it all clumpy
01:21:26 And you can see in the original one
01:21:28 There's some kind of like chunky like salt or some kind of like powder or like crusty stuff at the bottom
01:21:35 And I think that might be like a salt that the quinine is incorporated in because the salt is like glowing really
01:21:41 bright blue
01:21:42 And then in the middle is the stuff that I added the baking soda to and you know
01:21:46 It's got this chunky stuff at the bottom white kind of like like goopy stuff
01:21:51 And then in the right is I sort of like siphoned. I used a
01:21:56 syringe
01:21:57 to to suck up
01:21:59 Basically the glowing green
01:22:01 Liquid sort of rose to the top
01:22:03 So I like sucked that off the top
01:22:05 And then I put it in that that cup on the right and I used a coffee filter to filter like the bits out
01:22:09 So it's like just the liquid
01:22:12 so um
01:22:15 Yeah, this is what this is for this is for the the the face paint
01:22:20 Not anymore
01:22:22 It's just for real life. It's just to have it
01:22:25 Just to see what happens to smear on the wall. I don't know
01:22:29 uh, I just
01:22:31 At this point. I'm just seeing what happens
01:22:33 Uh, I just think I think that eventually the alcohol in the one on the right will just sort of boil off
01:22:41 and I'll be left with um
01:22:43 possibly pure quinine
01:22:46 or maybe some combination of
01:22:49 Uh sodium citrate and quinine or maybe
01:22:54 Maybe maybe just aspartame and quinine
01:22:57 Um
01:22:59 Yeah, I mean uh and then on the left I'm definitely I'm definitely not putting this stuff on my teeth
01:23:06 Sure
01:23:08 Uh
01:23:11 Slime it it's just it's yeah, I just got some glowing goo
01:23:17 In my room. You're a slime man, sir. I'm a slime. I'm a lean. I'm a limo man, sir
01:23:21 We were I was gonna add because you know, I I had plans at one point in in endless war to add um
01:23:28 A method of you could
01:23:29 It was basically be like a sort of a progression outside of the regular leveling system. It would be a form of like
01:23:37 Something of a way that you can progress your character that persists between
01:23:42 Uh
01:23:44 Lives and it would basically it was limo mancy and it was basically like
01:23:49 An ability to fight
01:23:51 without a weapon
01:23:52 basically by like slime based telekinesis that
01:23:57 I mean on a particular given run you probably could do more damage with a weapon
01:24:01 But like if you knew limo mancy, you would basically have like a certain baseline combat ability
01:24:07 That you would always have when you respawned even even weaponless
01:24:12 And it was going to be something that you had to take classes on
01:24:16 at um
01:24:18 nlacu
01:24:21 Not not the shitty not the shitty uh, what what's what's the shitty like community college called? Um
01:24:30 What an endless war I had no idea. Yeah, yeah in endless war there's there's new los angeles city university nlacu
01:24:36 and that's like the fancy one, but then there's like there's also, uh
01:24:42 Neo milwauke neo milwauke state or like neo milwauke community college
01:24:47 and uh
01:24:49 Basically to become a limo mancer you would have to pay exorbitant tuition fees
01:24:54 It was it was basically going to be like like a money sink like like if there's nothing if you have too much money
01:24:59 And there's nothing else to spend your money on you just you sink it into limo mancy to become a powerful limo mancer
01:25:05 And that's just like a thing that persists
01:25:07 It's a small thing that doesn't really make you more powerful in like the overall metagame
01:25:12 But it gives you like a certain benefit that carries over in between
01:25:16 runs basically
01:25:18 And I don't think it was ever implemented
01:25:20 uh, but that's
01:25:23 Exactly what i'm doing slime congeals right is right you study slime
01:25:30 and slime accessories
01:25:34 Um
01:25:37 But I think I mentioned yeah, I put the glowing powder in the tooth makeup
01:25:43 and the effect
01:25:44 You know what I'll show the picture that I posted
01:25:48 This I've given I gave up on the quinine. I gave up on the tonic. It was too complicated and stupid and probably dangerous
01:25:54 to my tooth health
01:25:57 But I mean when would that stop a slime boy?
01:26:02 uh, but uh
01:26:05 So I tried the
01:26:07 I tried the um
01:26:09 No, not copy link copy image
01:26:11 I tried putting the glowing stuff in the tooth makeup and uh, here are the results
01:26:16 and uh, you can't
01:26:18 Couldn't could not be more pleased with the
01:26:21 Yeah, it's so good. It's so good
01:26:25 Um, so I hope to do a little bit. I hope to do a little skit with that
01:26:31 Not exactly sure what the trailer will hat will be
01:26:35 Probably probably just a little thing where like I'm thinking maybe it's like oh
01:26:40 The framing of it is like
01:26:43 Oh, the the cop killer is addressing you like uh, you want to join my oh, you're new in town, huh?
01:26:48 You want to join a gang? Well here read this read this graphic novel by ben sain
01:26:53 It will tell you everything you need to know about life here in new los angeles city
01:26:58 Something like that
01:27:00 If you hold up the book in the video will it be
01:27:04 Let's well enough to see what it is
01:27:06 Uh, yeah, I think I'll probably have to do a cut
01:27:11 I'll probably have to like cut to me
01:27:13 Yeah, because if I hold the book up in this light, it will not
01:27:16 You might not be able to see what it is and it'll look weird. So yeah, that is a concern
01:27:22 I could but I could probably do a little a little
01:27:25 I mean, you got a great screen. You could do a funny like floating book thing
01:27:29 Oh, that's true. Yeah, but oh, I could just limo man see it in the cop killer is a master limo man sir
01:27:35 And he just whoo an intelligent he's so powerful
01:27:43 Yeah, yeah, I could wear
01:27:45 um
01:27:46 Yeah, this is all
01:27:49 I'm just gonna film something and then I'll just kind of try and fuck around with it in vegas to like see
01:27:55 What can I do with this? How can I make this look kind of funny or presentable or reasonable?
01:28:03 Uh, yeah
01:28:05 Don't don't exactly know what he's gonna look like
01:28:09 But anyway, I love I love that like
01:28:12 You can just see the glow like bouncing off of the ridge of your nose a little bit
01:28:18 Yeah, so it's like oh it is there, you know, it's like it doesn't look like it's just a cut out thing
01:28:24 It looks like your face is glowing
01:28:26 And it because it is because it is
01:28:29 It's a tactile practice. So I was practical effects practical effects
01:28:34 I
01:28:35 oh
01:28:37 I don't like how my face looks not in this picture. I mean just generally
01:28:41 But that's okay
01:28:45 You know, they'll be distracted by the glowing teeth true
01:28:49 You know what would have been cool and probably some people could do this is if I could print
01:28:53 with like fluorescent ink
01:28:56 I'm sure that some printers do that
01:28:58 But I do think it's kind of like a sort of weird and unusual like boutique
01:29:02 printing
01:29:03 Yeah, that would cost like a huge amount
01:29:07 First of all most printers probably couldn't do it and even the ones that could are probably more expensive baseline
01:29:13 And I'm sure they would charge
01:29:15 Yeah, out the ass to print in specialty ink, although maybe if it was just the cover it wouldn't be that bad
01:29:20 But whatever this printer doesn't offer the service and it's the one I'm going with so
01:29:26 I don't know. Maybe if I maybe if it sells like gangbusters and I have to print a special edition
01:29:30 10 years from now, we'll do the 10th anniversary special edition with glow in the dark
01:29:35 cover
01:29:38 Yeah
01:29:40 Now that now that would be how you achieved like a real like
01:29:45 neon green
01:29:46 Print I think is if you use like fluorescent yellow ink
01:29:50 The highlighter ink
01:29:53 Never never paint seems unnerved by the
01:29:59 As usually that's the point
01:30:02 It's meant to be
01:30:03 Highly it's meant to scare
01:30:06 People away
01:30:07 It's not they don't pledge. It's meant to
01:30:11 Exactly right. It's meant to scare away those low rolling
01:30:16 Poor juvies without two slime coin to clink together. Sorry
01:30:20 Captains of industry and high level gangsters only only the real slime heads are going to stick around through this pitch
01:30:28 To buy my freaking book
01:30:31 You know what I'm saying
01:30:33 Still waiting on my orange green screen to come in the mail
01:30:37 I just remembered. Yeah that I have a single slime coin, but not two
01:30:42 I'm currently looking at it. I wonder um
01:30:45 You know, I haven't tried putting the slime coin under a black light
01:30:50 Some of the some of the enamel pins that I got actually do
01:30:54 Look really good under a black light
01:30:56 But I don't know if the coins do
01:30:59 Red band would probably be like completely black
01:31:02 Yeah, I don't think aside from his eyes. I guess wait
01:31:06 Give me go back to being marge. This will this will only take this will take less time than the first time
01:31:11 I know exactly where it is. I don't
01:31:14 My marge bit was was it was it was a spur of the moment. What else can marge do other than say help me?
01:31:23 Help me I'm marge simpson like that's it. That's the whole bit
01:31:30 Um
01:31:32 Yo, oh, holy shit
01:31:34 Alpen's
01:31:36 ecstatic
01:31:38 I heard him exclaim
01:31:40 Hey gamers
01:31:43 Oh
01:31:45 Oh
01:31:46 Yeah, I'm yeah, I'm I'm thinking we're glowing
01:31:49 Yeah, that's glowing. Yeah, I'm thinking we're glowing under that black light
01:31:53 That looks really good. That looks super good that rules
01:31:58 I was afraid it wasn't yeah, I guess I got to get a black light or like an ultraviolet light. Is that
01:32:03 similar enough?
01:32:04 Uh, I mean, I think I think I kind of have like an ultraviolet light like a tiny little light bulb and like a
01:32:10 Toy thing. I think I think that's what a black light is basically
01:32:15 Well, how would you do?
01:32:17 Uh, I have like
01:32:18 I have like a big one. I have two like big like standing ones now
01:32:23 I also have a little tiny like little little mini flashlight of one
01:32:28 That's what I used to use. Uh, but now I have these the big ones. So
01:32:33 That's really cool. It looks super good
01:32:36 Uh, what was it? What were you talking about?
01:32:40 Enough enough of me showing off my funny my funny goo
01:32:44 Um, I guess nothing
01:32:47 Hmm. I said go watch Utena
01:32:51 I can't wait to get back to that
01:32:53 Uh
01:32:55 Fucking Clarissa fucking this and that whatever
01:32:58 This and that
01:33:01 I don't know. I guess my my week has been mostly about redoing the give and take website
01:33:06 and thinking about Clarissa stuff
01:33:11 And playing runescape and watching Utena and that's it
01:33:15 My weeks are very regimented and simple and they just just keep going
01:33:20 But cool cool
01:33:23 I do feel sometimes that I'm like
01:33:26 It's too
01:33:27 Similar like the days are too similar. I'm getting amount of I've got I'm getting an amount of work done and it's all positive
01:33:35 But I like I wake up. I do the work and I
01:33:38 I relax with the things that I want to relax with which are the same things
01:33:43 I'm like, maybe I need to switch it up a little bit. I don't really know what to do
01:33:47 It's it's still too annoying and cold outside for me to feel like I can go
01:33:52 For a nice walk, but I think I should do that. I think I should do some more walks
01:33:56 Mmm. Yeah, I yeah, the cold is um cold makes me want to stay inside
01:34:04 It's been the cold everything sucks when it's cold
01:34:07 it's been colder like
01:34:09 now in like early march
01:34:11 then it was
01:34:12 Like it was really it was very mild like most of winter and now
01:34:17 end of february it's finally like like
01:34:20 below freezing like snowing temperatures a little bit
01:34:24 It was like it was like felt like it was like 40 degrees
01:34:27 Uh, most of the through most of winter just kind of nice. I mean I like that
01:34:33 Um
01:34:37 Uh, I guess shall we go to voicemails? How long how long we've been going an hour an hour 30? Yeah. Yeah, okay. Um, you know what?
01:34:46 there actually was
01:34:49 Oh on my stream
01:34:51 The guy that sent a voicemail
01:34:54 From last week said that I didn't read
01:34:57 his voicemail
01:34:59 Because I was too distracted by the image
01:35:03 Uh
01:35:05 That he sent so
01:35:09 It was it was the one um
01:35:12 It was the one that was I think it was called like why and it was like a picture of phantom horns, but
01:35:18 Do you remember?
01:35:19 Uh, I don't if it was the last episode. I don't
01:35:23 Oh, that's right. You were I mean, right never mind
01:35:28 Uh
01:35:29 Shit, okay. Well, let me um, there's one saying why doe?
01:35:34 Oh, where? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, why doe?
01:35:38 Yeah, okay. Well, let me let me revisit this one because I told that guy I would go back
01:35:43 Yeah, I'm looking at the image, but let's listen. Here's the image. All right. Three two one go
01:35:48 I'm probably one of the three people who recently got into the pgp and ben verse
01:35:53 And I gotta ask is was phantom horn meant to be a parody of trans people has he been reclaimed?
01:35:59 Is he problematic? Oh, so why he think that's so
01:36:04 That's so devastating. Uh, I mean
01:36:07 The the the honest answer is yeah, he kind of was and now I feel bad about it
01:36:13 And I kind of uh
01:36:15 Yeah
01:36:16 I mean, he wasn't okay
01:36:19 I think I've talked I've talked about this before. Yeah, he he kind of was sort of a like ha ha
01:36:26 The sjw's have gone so far now an earth pony is identifying as a unicorn
01:36:32 Ha ha it's so wacky
01:36:35 What the left has the left has gone too far
01:36:38 Uh, and then I eventually was like, hey, that's kind of stupid
01:36:44 uh, and I and I
01:36:46 Made him cool by sending him to slime city and he became
01:36:49 A base dialectical materialist marxist and now he's good. He's been reclaimed. He's good now
01:36:56 Don't he does look pretty thick in that picture. He does look pretty he's looking. Yeah, he's looking like a short stack
01:37:01 He's short stack
01:37:03 He's literally stubby little way
01:37:05 I don't know why he drew him that way
01:37:08 He's chibi. I think I've said last week. He's just this is chibi phantom
01:37:12 um
01:37:14 Next
01:37:16 So is phantom just in and the swore now is he in that yeah that land?
01:37:21 Oh, just hanging out. Well, I don't know if you oh, this is this is a
01:37:25 One angle that I like kind of forgot. I was trying to type up like the Kickstarter page and I kind of forgot
01:37:30 And then I remembered is um, yeah, the ending of slime and punishment is like secret
01:37:36 And like the only way you could find it was by beating phantom's revenge and phantom's revenge is like way too hard
01:37:43 for the for the casual gamer
01:37:45 And not me though. I did it. That's right. But I think most people
01:37:50 Probably didn't I think like a pretty small number of people actually
01:37:55 did it so
01:37:57 Even the people that have read phantom's or slime and punishment most of them have not seen the end and that's a big reason
01:38:03 Why so if that's you and you're too casual you can buy my book and that has the ending in it lamau
01:38:08 Uh
01:38:12 But yeah, yeah, he um
01:38:14 Well, I guess is he does yeah, he posts slime and punishment. He just continues to live in uh
01:38:20 In new los angeles city. He he canonically lives there now
01:38:24 yep
01:38:25 Although he can he can go back to
01:38:27 equestria through
01:38:29 The night star portal which is now a permanent fixture in the uh
01:38:33 sky and someone devs
01:38:36 I hope an endless war dev is listening right now
01:38:38 If we can please add some functionality where you can travel to equestria
01:38:43 when you're on the blimp
01:38:45 When you jump through the portal
01:38:47 I would appreciate it just like twilight sparkle just like twilight sparkle
01:38:52 In that's the plot of equestria girls, right?
01:38:56 Uh, yeah
01:38:59 Yeah
01:39:01 Okay, I think the first voicemail this week is from it's called 6 30 38 from prince isolation
01:39:08 three two one
01:39:10 Go welcome back to the ben saint appreciation hour
01:39:14 Where on this episode a quote by ben saint
01:39:18 I already streamed for like two hours
01:39:22 And I started streaming kind of late today
01:39:25 So I think that I won't really go that long. I won't go like
01:39:31 Five hours or anything like that
01:39:36 Right
01:39:48 Let's listen to the whole song it's loud
01:39:54 I went really long it was a long stream
01:39:58 Uh, I think this is probably
01:40:01 Jesus the whole I really like the low quality of that really really bad
01:40:08 Uh, this is probably like I mean that might it was at the time when I beat the game because like I think I was just like
01:40:15 Like yeah, I'm gonna beat the game like I gotta beat the freaking game now
01:40:20 No, no that was the first stream
01:40:23 Of battle network
01:40:24 one
01:40:26 So I had just I was enjoying the game. I was really enjoying the game
01:40:29 um
01:40:30 the
01:40:31 Yeah, and I think
01:40:33 The one after that that I went for four hours
01:40:35 And yeah, I think I'm gonna try and keep my streams like four hours or shorter going forward
01:40:40 because viewership does not
01:40:44 Hold up
01:40:45 The whole I'm usually at like by by four hours in I'm at like half the viewership that the stream usually starts with it starts
01:40:52 Dip off around the three that's a historically been the case
01:40:55 I just want to increase the amount of time I play
01:40:58 I did that like last time it was a seven hours. You know, yeah
01:41:02 I only go through like four five
01:41:04 Maps in fire emblem. They take quite a lot. Oh quite a while. That's kind of
01:41:10 Yeah, when I do when I go six hours in a stream
01:41:13 partially, I'm just kind of like
01:41:15 Even if there's only you know, either there's only a few people actually in the chat
01:41:19 I'm kind of just playing it to play it because like
01:41:22 You know, but my goal is to play these games. So
01:41:26 Yeah
01:41:27 I don't feel like oh, nobody's watching. I gotta I gotta cut the stream. I'll come back later. I'm like
01:41:32 Well, even even if no one's watching I'm still getting I'm still accomplishing my goal
01:41:38 Uh while I'm streaming. So that's why I stream for a really long time. Sometimes this part of the reason why
01:41:45 Yeah
01:41:47 Thanks for making fun of me
01:41:49 Uh next one is called real
01:41:52 Oh, is it a a broken uh
01:41:56 Damn
01:41:58 Yeah, that's what also is says real. Maybe it was a fixed
01:42:03 Maybe they fixed it. Yeah, that first link didn't work for me
01:42:07 And then this is real question mark dot dot dot
01:42:14 It's got a voice attached
01:42:17 Yeah, okay, uh, let's um
01:42:22 Uh, okay, let's listen, uh, three two one go
01:42:27 I'm so very sorry to do this to you all. However
01:42:31 Uh
01:42:32 Let me just read it for you. This is
01:42:36 Yay, Ayano Koji bloated by not whole nuts on deviant art
01:42:43 Enjoy
01:42:46 Uh
01:42:49 Then
01:42:52 I thought this might be like veruca salt willy wonka, but I I mean it seems
01:42:59 Very similar. Um
01:43:03 Wait, okay, the the next one is an image
01:43:08 I'm sorry
01:43:10 glide yaito
01:43:13 Okay, yeah, so in mega man legends
01:43:16 Uh, there's this guy. There's a guy called glide and this girl yaito. I don't even know who that is
01:43:22 It must be like a really minor npc
01:43:25 And then I guess she kind of looks like
01:43:28 Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yai yaito and they kind of
01:43:32 I guess it's supposed to be the same
01:43:35 I yeah, I mean the girls definitely look similar
01:43:39 I don't even who is okay yaito mega man
01:43:46 Uh
01:43:48 Yo, there's a there's a trio called yokan. Oh
01:43:54 Okay
01:43:57 Yeah, it's one of the three women or girls that are sitting in the like village
01:44:04 Hut that asks you like a hundred trivia questions
01:44:10 To give you a freaking bonus item
01:44:15 That's like a fun job
01:44:17 Yeah, they're just at school cushion
01:44:20 She I think she asks you the like easy questions and then the one on the right asks you the middle questions
01:44:24 And then the one in the middle the sexy one
01:44:28 Asks you uh, the hard like the hundred hard questions
01:44:31 And all right, let's listen to the voicemail three two one go
01:44:36 I just realized I probably fucked up because I removed the image from my imgur
01:44:41 From the first link that I just sent so it probably didn't work
01:44:46 So you probably the first thing that you saw me send you related to this subject was just bloated. Yeah
01:44:52 I am very sorry about that. Here is the the actual reason that I sent you anything at all
01:44:59 the actual
01:45:01 interesting image post
01:45:04 I'm sorry
01:45:06 Uh, yeah
01:45:08 it does
01:45:10 kind of look
01:45:12 Yeah, yai is I I'm not sure if she's supposed to be like a tron bond. She's sort of like it looks like this girl yaito, but she's
01:45:20 She's like a rich girl like like tron bond and she kind of has tron bonds hairline
01:45:26 So I guess it's like they mash these
01:45:28 Two together and I don't know why this little girl from the school is even
01:45:34 Irrelevant, but yeah
01:45:36 Probably just like the design wanted to use it again. Yeah, we just like the design. Yeah
01:45:42 Um, they put her in a dress
01:45:44 That's interesting. I I told her
01:45:46 And then they put a hose upper
01:45:50 body and
01:45:51 pumped her full

01:47:47 She hates poot
01:47:50 um
01:47:52 I like your your stance in this one. Hmm
01:47:56 okay
01:47:58 Is the blessed I feel like we at some point maybe a long time ago somebody made a joke about the blessed land
01:48:04 About the jewish people. Is that like a term?
01:48:07 for them
01:48:09 This line you look like one of the blessed land that's from something or somebody said that and I don't remember
01:48:16 who
01:48:18 or why but
01:48:20 Commenters if you remember what this is a reference to it's it's something
01:48:25 Hang on jews
01:48:28 blessed
01:48:30 land
01:48:32 jew.com. Okay the term holy land usually refers to the
01:48:37 Territory roughly corresponding to the modern state of israel and the palestinian territories. Okay, they're all right
01:48:44 It is so maybe it's some why would they say blessed land? Why not the holy land?
01:48:50 No, I don't know this is this is a reference that I'm like blanking on
01:48:55 um
01:48:56 Next one is uh, but I do look cool in my zutsu there next one is
01:49:03 I dropped one piece
01:49:12 Oh, no, I forgot to read one piece this week. No you reminded me you reminded me and I said and I said okay
01:49:18 And then I didn't do it
01:49:21 Oh, no
01:49:24 Think of all the trash that you could say I could have read up. I could have been that this is literally me right now
01:49:36 What are you saying one piece is good actually
01:49:40 I
01:49:46 Just I really like
01:49:49 The complete like inversion of the reason for this mean this mean image
01:49:57 Oh, what a sad person who missed out on all that
01:50:09 Is
01:50:12 Is the implication that like the first 10 episodes are good
01:50:17 Or is it just that like all of one piece is trash and like yeah, it's a good thing you stop
01:50:23 I think they mean like the longer you go the worse it gets so just like if you
01:50:29 If you drop one piece it's good
01:50:33 I don't know. I just like it. I like this image how brazen how brazen to just like
01:50:39 One piece trash. It's all trash
01:50:43 Who says that true true, but also who but also true, but also how fucking dare you?
01:50:52 Okay
01:50:55 Oh good stuff. Oh boy

01:52:45 Now we're talking
01:52:47 Okay, uh
01:52:49 Here we go. Here we go. Here we go
01:52:51 uh
01:52:52 Next one is
01:52:55 An image
01:52:56 Oh, come on. Fluttershy. I got plenty common with you and viral mentalists both
01:53:03 Such as such as
01:53:05 Hmm. Well, we both hate coal burners, don't we?
01:53:09 What what does that smirk for applejack? What do you mean both hate coal burners? Is that a racist?
01:53:16 Thing I mean because it's applejack, of course everything she says is to raise it
01:53:22 I would imagine is that a joke, but I don't actually know the reference
01:53:27 I don't know what is being referred to oh
01:53:32 A non-black person usually a woman who has sexual relations with black people usually men
01:53:39 well
01:53:42 Now I know applejack
01:53:45 Applejack
01:53:48 Uh, uh, she's just kidding. No, it's fine. Yeah, she's just having she didn't learn anything
01:53:56 I didn't in woke school in crt. Yeah
01:54:02 Uh, I just wanted for many just one of her many quirky quirky traits
01:54:08 um
01:54:10 Okay, the next one is called give this man justice three two one go
01:54:16 So I just went back and skim through episode 132 of the pcp
01:54:20 Just because it was the deltarune one and I liked seeing everyone as the deltarune characters that gib true back
01:54:25 Oh, yeah
01:54:26 It was nice and fun
01:54:27 But someone left a voicemail on that episode
01:54:29 Calling in to make fun of Nate for using an electric skateboard
01:54:33 And then he did a grind on his real skateboard during the voicemail and recorded the like
01:54:38 Sound I remember that and uh, I forget by calling him a pussy or whatever
01:54:43 There's the best voicemail ever and I think it was before voice grail
01:54:46 So I want to let you know that you should retroactively give that guy
01:54:50 From four years ago voice grail
01:54:53 Also, uh, does Nate still use his electric skateboard? I feel like I haven't heard about that in a million years. Um
01:55:00 I don't know
01:55:03 Sorry your voicemail was just so boring
01:55:06 I I agree about the voice grail though
01:55:08 I remember that one
01:55:09 I remember we all cracked up because it was just sort of like just a typical voicemail
01:55:13 But then he did the the skateboard trick with the audio
01:55:17 I and it's and then it was like, yeah, fuck you. It's great
01:55:22 I actually don't
01:55:24 remember that
01:55:26 Almost at all. I don't think so. Maybe I I remember it was funny enough that everybody laughed including Nate. Hmm
01:55:33 Oh, yeah, I'm drawn a blank but sounds pretty cool
01:55:38 An electric vouch for that for that voice grail. All right. Okay. Let's do it. Let's freaking go
01:55:44 Let's do it. He's in god's gift to grinds is in
01:55:48 Yes, yeah
01:55:51 Do you um
01:55:53 Shit, uh
01:55:55 Okay, the electric skateboard is like one with a motor on it, right that like
01:55:59 Propels the Casey Neistat boards. Yes. Oh, yeah. I mean, I have no idea if he uses it. I haven't heard him mention it
01:56:05 In forever. So probably not he probably just drives
01:56:10 Yeah, it's a bit of a weird thing to go around using. Yeah
01:56:15 Having a car is inconvenient as it is in new york city, which is why Casey Neistat uses that all the time. Hmm
01:56:22 Yeah, I uh, I don't know. I don't know if he's it
01:56:25 Um, he's probably not grinding on it too much
01:56:29 Okay, next one is called thoughts about this
01:56:32 Hey, you. Hmm. Well, it's kind of gross
01:56:36 Reminds me of that that
01:56:38 I don't know what artist did it but like something something a teaspoon made of fur
01:56:43 Oh, and it's like a series of like what if an object was like made of a material that made its purpose
01:56:50 pointless
01:56:52 It was made it really bad at its
01:56:54 As its purpose like something that you would heat up being made of
01:56:58 I don't know bubbles or something
01:57:01 Maybe being made of wood. Oh, I see merit Oppenheim
01:57:06 Yeah, I see it's like a teap a cup and and a dish
01:57:12 Here I got I got the image cup and a dish and a spoon
01:57:16 Cup and a dish and a
01:57:18 Hey, I'm eating a cup and a dish and a year
01:57:21 Yeah, that's the one. Yeah
01:57:25 It makes sort of it makes it sort of pointless that it exists
01:57:30 Makes makes but I guess in this in this case you could cut
01:57:34 The non-hairy part of the cheese away any bad if you really wanted to yeah, I think that's probably how I would
01:57:40 Approach this this cheese problem
01:57:43 Is AI generated?
01:57:45 No, no, it's gay. I generated gay. Yo
01:57:50 sick
01:57:52 Was there
01:57:56 Was there some AI news
01:57:59 I mean I might have
01:58:00 I might have talked about that one clip, you know that one like really fancy looking clip going around of like the high resolution like
01:58:07 People playing rock paper scissors
01:58:10 I haven't seen that but I don't the thing that's annoying me with AI is that
01:58:15 Extremely unfunny people are going out in droves to make the same video over and over again
01:58:20 Of donald trump and joe biden and whoever else
01:58:24 Just like in about whatever and it's like ha ha. Isn't it funny?
01:58:27 Isn't it funny that these famous people that you wouldn't expect to be playing a video game
01:58:32 Are playing a video game and they're on headsets and that's it. I gotta admit
01:58:36 Uh, I saw I saw like a couple of those and I did think a few of them were really funny
01:58:41 It's funny once but like it's now it's now now that's so accessible
01:58:46 It's just gonna continually be a thing. Yeah, that's god. That's a gag. That's a gag
01:58:50 That's not gonna that's not gonna you got to be good at writing if you want to make something that that funny
01:58:54 I really think that the that tall barts
01:58:59 Videos of uh, joe rogan and uh, ben Shapiro and jordan peterson
01:59:04 Uh talking about their money troubles are really good. He's he's tall bars. Pretty good. I you guys really funny scripts
01:59:11 I like them. I um
01:59:13 I mean tall bar was making like youtube poops like sentence mixing without AI
01:59:18 So they clearly
01:59:20 they have
01:59:21 uh
01:59:23 They've they've shown that they can come up with some some funny things the AI stuff though. It feels a little
01:59:30 I don't know less funny. I think
01:59:32 Something you think you think it was funnier when he was mixing their actual words together. Yeah, because it sounds unnatural
01:59:39 it's the sort of
01:59:40 It's it's it's the it's the fact that it's it's obviously not really them
01:59:45 that
01:59:46 It something there's there's an extra element of like absurdism
01:59:51 in there that makes it like
01:59:53 I don't know. I'd prefer it. I guess
01:59:55 Yeah, so somebody's saying like saying
01:59:58 Like a like an AI generated voice of a person who you wouldn't expect to say I suck dick saying I suck dick is like
02:00:04 Sure, they wouldn't say that but just sounds like them saying something sounds like a person talking
02:00:10 But if you okay, but if you sentence mix it
02:00:13 There's something else to it and I like that. I think
02:00:16 I mean, I think I mean tall tall barts tall barts skits have a little more going on in them than just having
02:00:23 Jordan Peterson say that he's gay or whatever
02:00:26 Uh, that's a lot of it. But yeah
02:00:28 it
02:00:29 I don't know. I saw I saw
02:00:31 They they've started to sort of they have sort of like a narrative to them
02:00:35 They like they like sort of make jokes about themselves and like they have I don't know
02:00:39 I saw one that was Jordan. It was it was
02:00:42 Rogan and Ben, uh, they were they were AI generating like
02:00:47 Like oh now make now. Let's make well this AI stuff is so funny
02:00:50 Let's make Jordan Peterson say some gay stuff or whatever and then they do that for what?
02:00:55 I don't know. Are they just I like I think he's good and they're
02:00:59 I don't think they're bad. Fuck you. Fuck you. Just leave my man tall bart alone. I don't think I'm bad
02:01:06 That's all they are they are competent and humorous
02:01:10 I just I guess I've just seen a lot of it recently and I'm like, yeah
02:01:15 Well, where where's lamp oil roping bombs, huh? Where's my boy and dinner? Like I want more of that
02:01:22 Where's where's my boy and dinner? Okay. I mean sure no
02:01:26 I understand what you mean about like. Yeah the weird
02:01:30 The weird and unnatural way that it sounds when they just like are obviously cutting like lines together
02:01:35 To make them say some wacky shit. Yeah. Yeah, it has a different
02:01:39 It's funny for in a totally different way. Yeah
02:01:42 Um
02:01:43 I thought it was I thought it was really funny to see tall bark. Yeah, I had been following tall barton. I've been seeing
02:01:48 his uh
02:01:50 His mixes his videos and then when AI came out
02:01:53 He's he suddenly like jumped on the AI train and he started doing like
02:01:57 Some slight with some different ones
02:01:59 using this AI voice tool
02:02:02 And I thought that's great. I don't know. It's cool. He's like, oh a new thing I can make these videos out of well
02:02:08 I'll do it
02:02:10 And he did it and I think it's good
02:02:13 I think it's good
02:02:15 Uh next one is called
02:02:18 Uh, how would you send? Yeah, how to send file without vocaru
02:02:24 And then he sends it by vocaru
02:02:27 So that's interesting three three two one go
02:02:32 Bro, remember ram ram movers. He fucking died. He didn't make enough money. What the fuck
02:02:40 Just like uh maple sorry too
02:02:43 What the fuck life sucks
02:02:47 Okay, you don't need to pretend you care
02:02:50 Uh maple, okay. What was the Rambo verse?
02:02:56 Rambo verse I don't remember Rambo verse
02:03:00 Or whatever that could be
02:03:03 I guess he's talking about like I think he's saying rumble verse
02:03:07 I don't even know what that is. What is that?
02:03:11 Rumble verse was a free to play brawler battle royale video game
02:03:15 developed by iron galaxy and published by epic games publishing
02:03:19 I heard about that
02:03:22 It 91% liked this video game
02:03:25 Did it die?
02:03:27 It apparently yeah, I guess it I guess it got shut down
02:03:30 Rumble versus shut down feels sudden, but the writing was on the wall. Yeah, I guess the game died
02:03:36 I mean
02:03:38 I
02:03:39 Never thought about it even that was that while it existed. That was the dodge ball game, wasn't it?
02:03:46 I don't
02:03:48 I'm pretty sure I saw somebody watching it and react into it as like a trailer
02:03:55 Maybe it's germa and he was like, oh it looks pretty good
02:03:59 And it looked like a dodge ball game, but like battle royale dodge ball
02:04:04 Maybe it was like really like announced it like e3 or something that I can don't know
02:04:09 Do they do e3 does that exist anymore? I think they
02:04:14 I think they don't I think e3 died everyone's dead
02:04:20 Does that mean the packs became the new e3?
02:04:23 I don't know. I think everyone does
02:04:26 Nintendo events. Oh, yeah. Now they all now they all do Nintendo directs and stuff. There's no need for a freaking convention
02:04:35 Coronavirus killed everything including video games coronavirus literally killed
02:04:42 Someone who was working at at packs like two years ago or like a year or two ago
02:04:49 They they they did they did one they did packs in spite of everything and somebody died
02:04:58 Not so good, not so good, not so good. I wonder
02:05:04 Um, I wonder if they still
02:05:08 Do them
02:05:10 Packs let's let's look at packs on twitter
02:05:12 um
02:05:14 At packs twitter
02:05:15 No, I mean they're still going
02:05:18 March 3rd looking for something that packs east 2023. Okay, so they're doing packs east
02:05:24 Um, okay, you all you know, I guess one little death isn't gonna
02:05:31 Isn't gonna stop you
02:05:34 I mean, you know
02:05:37 It's kind of true a bit like
02:05:40 It's not it's not it's not like oh packs literally killed someone
02:05:43 You know somebody got somebody got covid and somebody died and I mean, I guess these things do happen
02:05:49 But I was hearing about it and I can't it can't be good
02:05:53 Can't be good publicity. It can't be good for like view. It can't be good for attendee enthusiasm
02:06:00 Uh, I would always hear about gaming conventions and like all my favorite youtubers would go to whatever convention
02:06:05 And I would see the things and they would have a little video. It's like well, I went to the thing
02:06:10 But they it always seemed like such a fucking
02:06:13 nightmare
02:06:14 Even though it was fun in some ways
02:06:17 I went to
02:06:19 the last day of packs east like
02:06:22 Maybe like four or five years ago. Maybe five or six years ago. Yeah, and then
02:06:29 Funny story, maybe I've told it before sheep over
02:06:33 You know, you're a sheep over who used to be a
02:06:36 Mumke's girlfriend at one point
02:06:39 Said that she saw me and this was post tbap and I think maybe even post pcp
02:06:43 She saw me and she recognized me, but she didn't say hi because she was uh
02:06:48 Chai or something
02:06:51 Then she told me later. Oh, yeah, I literally I saw you like at a food truck at packs east
02:06:56 I was like, yep. Wow. I was there on sunday that one year
02:07:00 Very funny
02:07:03 Um
02:07:07 What was the other one he said rumble verse and
02:07:10 Uh maple story too, I guess
02:07:13 I've heard of maple story
02:07:15 Uh, I think I did know that there was a maple story too
02:07:20 I didn't know that it died
02:07:22 Oh maple story too lives on in our hearts through its creative expression and unique aesthetic
02:07:27 We'd like to thank the wonderful maplers
02:07:30 No
02:07:33 We'd like to thank
02:07:36 We'd like to thank the wonderful maplers that inhabited its charming world by offering you the chance to keep some of what made the game special
02:07:42 Here you'll find links to download all kind of designs illustrations concept art and more
02:07:46 There's tons of art and never-before-seen assets and we invite you to take a look
02:07:49 We've also uploaded the music of maple story 2 onto our official youtube channel
02:07:53 Or you can always find it if you want to take a trip down memory lane or download and take it with you on the go
02:07:59 Oh my god
02:08:03 Why is that hitting me so hard?
02:08:06 It's it's it's a real big thing when it's like
02:08:10 Like
02:08:12 A lot of virtual worlds online like mmo's that they feel more than just like a video game
02:08:18 Uh, especially when you're young you spend a lot of time on there. They're like a virtual like physical
02:08:24 place
02:08:26 And then they don't exist anymore
02:08:29 People get real fucked up about that. So I know I do
02:08:33 I'm still sad about world of warcraft changing everything in the cataclysm
02:08:38 I thought you were gonna say club penguin. I mean club penguin is as well. I was gonna say that as well
02:08:42 And then good and and and then like runescape before they released old school runescape
02:08:48 Runescape had changed beyond recognition. It was just like this is not what I lived with. This is not my friend
02:08:55 I hate this place
02:08:57 That's what I say every time I look in the pcp server
02:09:02 Uh, yeah
02:09:05 Oh, I'm I'm I'm that's just that's just so sad. I don't know. I don't know. I just thought
02:09:13 I don't know
02:09:14 I can't look at this anymore
02:09:16 Maple story one still exists like maple story one didn't die
02:09:20 but I guess two was just like
02:09:23 I wonder why two died just the the player base didn't migrate
02:09:29 I guess uh, maybe the business model was just not
02:09:35 Damn
02:09:37 Best the best laid plans
02:09:40 um
02:09:41 next one is um
02:09:44 The philosophy nerd hour from prince isolation at twitter.com
02:09:49 three two one go
02:09:51 On episode 350 of the pro-crastinators
02:09:55 Men's saint does not seem to fully understand what
02:09:58 Vinny Vitevichy means when he says that he appreciates give and take for simply being who she is
02:10:04 But if he'd have read kirkegaard and specifically the sickness unto death
02:10:09 He'd have known that according to kirkegaard
02:10:12 We are constantly living in a state of despair because of the friction in our human condition between what we want out of life
02:10:20 And out of ourselves. That's me and what we eventually get and what the limits of the material world are
02:10:28 and
02:10:29 because of this he claims that
02:10:32 Everyone can live with despair in
02:10:34 several ways
02:10:36 One of these ways is despairing wishing to be oneself wherein someone
02:10:42 Wants to be themselves
02:10:44 But wants to basically change their condition of existence and continually improve and fight against their despair
02:10:52 In the other case there is despairingly not willing to be oneself
02:10:57 In which case one despairs of existence so much that they don't even want to have their own
02:11:03 Identity anymore. They want to basically reject themselves and their own lives. So I suppose the question is ben
02:11:11 Do you want to be yourself?
02:11:15 uh
02:11:21 It's a big question
02:11:24 um
02:11:26 I feel like i'm not supposed to answer seriously
02:11:29 uh
02:11:31 I've a lot of I don't know. I think I think a lot of the time most of the time. Yeah
02:11:36 A lot of the time, you know what a lot of the time I do fall into a state of like
02:11:41 I wish I just didn't exist the I have those I have those times. I wish I could just disappear
02:11:48 uh
02:11:50 But you know
02:11:52 It's not all the time. So I guess I guess it's a little a column a and a little a column b for me
02:11:57 I have both
02:11:58 I get you a guy who can do both kinds of despair. I guess
02:12:02 Little column a a little a column bang
02:12:05 Um
02:12:08 Got him
02:12:10 Uh, well that was educational
02:12:14 So next up
02:12:15 Well, there's an image and
02:12:17 Another voicemail from the ben and give appreciation hour
02:12:21 From prince isolation
02:12:24 Steeped in malice and cruelty steeped in malice and cruelty
02:12:29 Uh
02:12:30 This is what
02:12:32 Endless jess said my blue rays are steeped in malice and cruelty. That's the joke
02:12:39 Uh
02:12:40 Next one. Oh, no not the next one. There's a voicemail. There's a voicemail. Okay three two one go
02:12:46 In honor of the jessie blood feud
02:12:49 also
02:12:50 Recently ben said that um in another iconic quote
02:12:56 that
02:12:57 He becomes stronger every time someone spurns him which
02:13:02 Also goes hard and it reminded me of a song that I think is very ben core
02:13:09 it's called I think see the light by ghost and uh the main the main
02:13:17 Chorus of that song goes every day that you feed me with hate I grow stronger
02:13:23 And I think that is possibly the most ben core song ghost also has a big cathedral
02:13:31 Like like christio
02:13:35 Inspired religious
02:13:37 But also satanic angle. Uh, I you know ben I think if you don't already listen to ghost try it
02:13:42 I think you might like try that song try see the light. I feel like it's your vibe anyways, you know, bye
02:13:50 You know, I know
02:13:53 What am I
02:13:55 First of all, I appreciate this drawing. I love my little slime my little slime drool
02:14:00 uh
02:14:02 Although I don't wear
02:14:03 khakis unless those are supposed to be jeans because I do wear jeans
02:14:07 Um, I rarely tuck my shirt in. I'm not a nerd
02:14:12 Uh, but thank you. Um, do you know ghost?
02:14:17 Uh the lord of
02:14:19 No the the band
02:14:22 Uh, is that the one with the animator who did the little thing?
02:14:27 Or was that the song called ghost?
02:14:30 Oh, are you talking about I've been feeling like a ghost. Yeah, I guess that was the song
02:14:36 I hate them. Oh
02:14:38 uh
02:14:40 Yeah, no that yeah, that's a song. Uh, no ghost. Okay. I don't I've never listened to ghost
02:14:47 Uh, I guess they're kind of a big sort of I don't know. I don't
02:14:53 What I gather from seeing their stuff is that they're sort of a big like kind of theatrical sort of yeah gothic
02:15:01 metal
02:15:02 question mark
02:15:03 band
02:15:04 And I think they do like really elaborate costume sort of stage
02:15:11 Shows I think I think there's a lot of like theater in their
02:15:16 work
02:15:18 and uh
02:15:19 I feel and I
02:15:22 Sorry to be a hipster. I don't listen to them
02:15:27 I kind of feel like I see them around enough. I'm gonna be an asshole. I'm seeming to contrarian asshole
02:15:31 I feel like I see them around enough that they're unpopular enough that people sometimes think like, oh, yeah
02:15:38 I'm into this indie band ghost. I you ever heard of it, uh, but they're but they're not actually as like
02:15:44 Underground as people think because I feel I feel like I have seen
02:15:48 I've known people that like them
02:15:51 and uh
02:15:52 The fact of the matter and I know I'm being unreasonable here
02:15:55 Uh, I've known people that like them and I don't like those people who I have known who like them
02:16:00 Although maybe there's other people that I know that like them. They just never brought it up
02:16:03 Maybe I'm just thinking of a few people who were vocal about their
02:16:07 Appreciation of ghost who now I don't like and that does get and that does sour my opinion of this band that I've never heard
02:16:13 I don't listen to
02:16:16 But maybe I should give them a try and I would change my mind
02:16:18 And
02:16:20 Thoughts give
02:16:22 Uh, my thoughts is why is this the been and give appreciation hour? Yeah, I had nothing to do with give
02:16:30 I mean, I guess it's and
02:16:32 Yeah, this should be this should have been the been or give appreciation hour because at least one of us was appreciated
02:16:38 You just say ben appreciation hour if you want if you want to talk about ben, I don't mind
02:16:42 Or you yeah, you just
02:16:44 Like sometimes people just send a voicemail and it's directed to one of us and that's okay
02:16:49 There's nothing there's nothing wrong with a ben a good old ben appreciation hour
02:16:53 I guess prince isolation wants to stick to the brand of like this is the been and give appreciation hour and it will contain appreciation of
02:17:01 One or both of us and that's the
02:17:06 Uh, okay, that's what I think about ghosts
02:17:09 Uh, I've probably heard one or two of their songs
02:17:11 But like without realizing that it was them
02:17:15 because I feel I feel like they are
02:17:18 Known and popular enough that I
02:17:20 I do hear people talk about ghost
02:17:22 um
02:17:23 Next one is called. I hope nate is on this podcast so he can apologize to ben
02:17:28 Uh, three two one go
02:17:35 Okay, so nasa sent people that's what I
02:17:39 And it was this massive technical feat
02:17:42 And everyone thought it was impossible and they did it, right?
02:17:46 So you believe that but then you turn around and you say that
02:17:50 Well, no, there's no way they could have had a camera that could film that long like
02:17:55 Like do you have no imagination? You just use a bigger
02:17:58 Like it's good. What okay
02:18:01 First of all, does this have anything to do with nate? I don't think nate does moon landing denial
02:18:07 But I know I thought maybe he was responding to something from last episode. I wasn't privy to
02:18:14 Wasn't aware of I know I don't I don't think so
02:18:17 What is he talking about with a camera?
02:18:20 Okay, I I'm not sure
02:18:22 I've heard that specific
02:18:25 Thing but like yeah, I guess maybe people that say the moon landing could not have happened say well, they recorded too much footage
02:18:32 Yeah, they couldn't have
02:18:34 That much footage in a camera and that and I don't I don't know if I've ever heard people say that before
02:18:38 But that is the kind of thing people say
02:18:40 Because they are like so limited and they're thinking that they're like well any camera
02:18:45 That would go up on the space shuttle would be exactly like a commercial camera that I like I use
02:18:51 In my real life and therefore like the the the memory limits that I am subject to in my normal life
02:18:57 Would apply there too, right when in fact, no, they could simply make a custom camera that has different capacities
02:19:04 What is the argument here that they couldn't have faked the moon landing because they couldn't have enough film?
02:19:10 No, I think wait because because this guy's saying you believe the moon landing happened
02:19:14 But then you also believe this other thing
02:19:19 That they couldn't be enough film I'm like who's having this who what's what argument
02:19:24 What person would make this argument? I miss under
02:19:30 I'm listening to it again
02:19:33 I'm yeah, I am really confused are there can't be someone who is like. Oh, yeah. Yeah, the moon landing is real
02:19:40 but
02:19:41 they couldn't have actually filmed it because
02:19:45 Yeah, I don't I don't get it. Oh, is this like a weird like double like they believe the moon landing happened
02:19:50 But they believe the footage of it was faked
02:19:53 some for some reason
02:19:56 What is this have I've never heard of that didn't they'd say this there's no way
02:20:00 No, I don't think so. I think the title is completely unrelated
02:20:04 Okay
02:20:08 Maybe
02:20:09 Yeah, there maybe there is someone who is like, yes, there was a moon landing
02:20:13 But the footage is fake because the footage what the footage was staged because they couldn't film the real thing
02:20:22 Maybe somebody believes that lamau
02:20:24 Uh, next one is called. That's a very funny
02:20:27 Like conclusion to draw
02:20:30 from the whole thing
02:20:32 Like I would never have considered this idea
02:20:35 They probably just had funny cameras
02:20:37 They could put a man they could they could get a rocket into space and put a man on the moon
02:20:41 But they couldn't make a camera with a real big enough to film it
02:20:46 God could you know, it just could god
02:20:51 Do a moon landing so impressive that even he couldn't film it on a camera
02:20:57 I think perhaps
02:20:59 Next one is called bend.exe 321 go
02:21:04 Hey, Ben, congrats on beating bow network one
02:21:07 Did you ever have plans to play network transmission on gamecube?
02:21:11 Pretty sure you already know, but it's basically classic mega man, but with the battleship mechanics
02:21:17 Oh, in fact, it's actually got a lot of callbacks to the first game
02:21:21 Which is pretty cool
02:21:24 And more importantly, it's got zero dot exe
02:21:27 Which I think is just the coolest version of zero throughout the entire franchise. That's so funny spoilers. I'm sorry. I guess technically
02:21:36 His battle chips really fucking suck, but
02:21:39 You know just being able to summon zero to fight is just really cool and I just do it anyway
02:21:46 um
02:21:48 But yeah
02:21:49 Good luck with the rest of your battle network series and thank you
02:21:54 To your next lecture or whatever the hell it may be
02:21:58 sweet, uh
02:22:00 I will start working on the next lecture soon. I just as I
02:22:05 Oh, that's another fucking thing that I got on my plate that I have not even been able to really
02:22:10 Do so many irons
02:22:12 It's a little too many irons
02:22:14 Okay, that's really funny. First of all, I didn't know that that's what battle transmit or network transmission is
02:22:22 Um, I have I was planning on playing it because I know that it's part of the series
02:22:26 I didn't know what it was though, but that actually sounds like it could be really fun
02:22:30 Like it's like a side scroller, but with about that sounds awesome. Now. I now I really want to play it
02:22:36 um
02:22:36 And that's really funny that you say
02:22:39 That about zero because at least one person in my chat has told me that zero dot exe is like the worst
02:22:46 Version of zero and they and they hate them
02:22:49 So I'm interested to hear that opinions are divided on zero dot exe
02:22:53 So I look forward. Maybe he's like super edgy
02:22:57 The proto man in in uh mega man dot exe is basically I mean he looks very much like he's a he's a mashup of proto man and zero
02:23:08 So it's like they were trying to combine those two into one
02:23:12 Character and they just called him proto man. I know that there is a zero dot exe
02:23:16 I actually don't know what he looks like. I haven't looked him up
02:23:19 But someone told me they hate his design and now this guy says he's really cool
02:23:22 Even though his chips are bad. So
02:23:25 That's exciting. Yeah, I definitely want to play um network transmission
02:23:30 um
02:23:32 Probably in in release order. I should look into like what exit which what were the release order was
02:23:37 next one
02:23:39 It's a new comic. I think it yeah, it's a dropbox link. That's me
02:23:45 Yes, I yes my the the sniffer
02:23:48 Sniffed the the the I forget what is the big nose
02:23:54 Sniffed my boobies away
02:23:56 No
02:23:57 How could you
02:23:58 It's not fair. I never get what I want as soon as I am happy some goofy shit has to happen to take it away from me
02:24:05 They were perfect a million M and Feminine
02:24:10 What make them that big again my life's over. They were so squishy and snuggly and warm and it's just not fair
02:24:17 True
02:24:18 I can't go on like this. Everything is ash and woe. I'm gonna kill myself
02:24:22 Yeah, I'm gonna jump off the top of hq and fall infinitely into the void
02:24:27 Void void void void void void void void void etc
02:24:33 How should I do error Ari's voice?
02:24:37 Hey, you you want to put some clothes on is that too much? Is the inward voice too much?
02:24:43 I remember that from the t-bat place
02:24:46 Hey, you want to put some clothes on no, that's too much. That's all too you want to put some clothes on you want to put on some clothes
02:24:54 Void void
02:24:57 Uh
02:24:58 Whose giant butt is that is that error Ari's giant part with the heart shamed pockets going through the the the doors there
02:25:06 Okay, oh, let me zoom in
02:25:08 Oh, yes error Ari
02:25:11 doing a little
02:25:13 doing a little rarity
02:25:15 Oh, it's a it's a dress
02:25:18 making
02:25:20 It's the art. She's really doing the art of the dress right now
02:25:23 Cool. Cool. Now, let's hit those nine flights of stairs
02:25:28 nine
02:25:29 That's a lot of flights
02:25:32 That's looks so cute
02:25:34 It is cute. Uh, I look like jade
02:25:38 Yeah, yeah, definitely
02:25:41 So why do we got to find Nate again?
02:25:44 So we can use him as a blood sacrifice for the Nate fuckers
02:25:48 Wait, what?
02:25:51 I mean everybody wants him back on the podcast so might as well get some sweet content out of it
02:25:56 Can't blame him though. Nate always brought that 2017 cringy edge that I sort of miss
02:26:02 Why do you stop coming on anyway again? Why do you stop coming on anyway?
02:26:06 I don't know he didn't say and then he started the gamer zone and talking pirates
02:26:10 Apparently we're too cring for him to associate with let alone podcast weekly
02:26:16 But but podcasting easy
02:26:18 Oh, right
02:26:19 Now that's right. Yeah

02:28:32 Hey, hey close one. Is that the bear?
02:28:36 Is that the bear from gamer and the bear perhaps?
02:28:39 I was thinking it was
02:28:41 Beware beware of the bear could no prepare for the bear prepare for the bear much more likely. Maybe they're the same bear
02:28:50 Why
02:28:53 There's just two bears and there they are
02:28:56 It's just one of the two bears
02:28:58 Uh
02:29:00 It's so good. This is so good. Did we say on the show that like
02:29:04 Hey, we'd love to maybe put some of these uh new comics in the in the in the throw them in the in the dang
02:29:11 Perfect comic party
02:29:14 I think I should we definitely mentioned it. But yeah, I should reach out to new on twitter and like ask him like
02:29:19 Hey, what do you think? What do you think if we put these in there? Should we?
02:29:24 You you said you you have the high res of all the
02:29:28 The past chapters, right? Uh, yes
02:29:31 Okay, cool. Um
02:29:35 This one
02:29:37 This one's really this one looks really good
02:29:40 The faces in this one are really cool. I have I don't have enough nice things to say about news art
02:29:46 uh, but I think
02:29:48 There's uh, there is a new there is a new drawn comic in the dojin. So
02:29:54 That'll be funny. I need a dress like this. This is a good dress. It looks cool
02:29:59 This this the one where you got your tongue hanging out the the posture. Yeah, it's great. You look like
02:30:06 You're running me of elaine from sign film and I always liked her so pretty
02:30:12 Look at the librarian like a gothic librarian. Yes. Very cool. Very
02:30:19 Very nice
02:30:20 new
02:30:21 You've done it again
02:30:23 You saw you son of a bitch. You've done it again
02:30:27 Uh, thank you very much. I'll appreciate it
02:30:30 uh, next one
02:30:32 should be like
02:30:34 You know, I saw um
02:30:36 I saw the dick show like posting fan art. They were like posting the fan art that they got that week
02:30:43 on twitter
02:30:45 And maybe we should do that or something. I don't know
02:30:48 Because like yeah, that's pretty funny
02:30:52 Some of the stuff probably deserves to be
02:30:54 I mean, we don't really use the twitter for that much. Do we I don't I really don't use the twitter for for
02:30:59 I hardly ever do. Yeah, I just use it to retweet
02:31:03 Maybe things
02:31:05 That I tweet that maybe I want the pcp audience to see as well and like that's mostly most of what I do with it
02:31:11 um
02:31:13 Yeah, it'd be a good idea. I think probably it probably would be a good idea. Okay. The next one is an image
02:31:20 What is
02:31:22 Dang this
02:31:26 Dang congressman, which I had a wife who would tell me her prophetic dreams. Oh
02:31:33 it's um
02:31:34 I think
02:31:35 If I'm remembering remembering correctly
02:31:39 There's a there's a congressman called a representative clay higgins
02:31:44 Who just straight up says that like his wife gets visions from god and has prophetic dreams
02:31:50 Yeah, I think I may have heard of it. Yeah, and and he
02:31:56 I wish I had a wife who would tell me everything
02:31:59 Maybe if I had a maybe if I had a psychic profit for a wife, maybe I could have been a congressman too
02:32:06 Uh, unfortunately, it just didn't work out that way
02:32:10 I'm pretty sure it's clay higgins that I'm thinking of
02:32:14 Um, unless I mixed him up with someone
02:32:16 Because I follow clay higgins on twitter and his tweets are boring and but I just followed him for the meme
02:32:24 Next one is
02:32:27 Oh, I already posted it. Next one is called to gib from me. Please and thankles
02:32:32 three two one go
02:32:35 Yeah, I don't know if you heard yet, but ben was
02:32:39 racist
02:32:42 That the robot was in your place for
02:32:45 Uh, do you need skulls for me? Thank you. What what did you say?
02:32:50 Wait robot. You must have it must have taken my mind. You remind me how racist you are ben saint
02:32:56 I said that you scolded me. You woke scolded me for saying that gino samuels
02:33:03 Delivery was stiff and robotic. You said I shouldn't use the r-word
02:33:08 Oh
02:33:10 You said it was triggering and I said I would do better
02:33:14 Um
02:33:16 How do you not remember? How do you not remember this?
02:33:18 Uh, I don't know. I just you were so you were so you were so adamant. You were so
02:33:24 Impassioned about it
02:33:26 It was a rollback
02:33:28 I got you
02:33:30 Uh, next one is called. Oh, here we go. Gib appreciation. Oh, this one's not the ben and gib appreciation hour
02:33:37 This one's just the gib appreciation not even an hour. All right. Okay three two one go
02:33:42 Also on this episode of the ben and gib appreciation hour
02:33:46 I was listening to gib stream and she made a very cute funny joke
02:33:51 Where she just went like oh looking at my character stats high strength high speed. Hi. How are you?
02:33:58 And I appreciate that joke. It was small, but it was and it was subtle, but it was good
02:34:03 also also
02:34:05 I figured I should give a counterpart to
02:34:08 Music that is very ben saint core music that feels very gib core. Have you ever heard of igloo ghost igloo ghost?
02:34:15 Everything is really weird glitch core like
02:34:19 um
02:34:20 Bops and whistles kind of sounding music
02:34:23 That is like very otherworldly, but also the mascots for it are like these weird little like
02:34:29 clown-esque alien creatures with like big noses and party hats and um
02:34:34 The the lyrics I think are supposed to be like their language and it's really weird and funny and cute
02:34:41 And I feel like gib might like that and it just it feels gib core. It's like it's like odd and silly
02:34:50 and and and like nice and and chaotic and cool
02:34:54 And I don't know check it out
02:34:57 So
02:34:59 I get regular ghost and you get igloo ghost. I get igloo ghost. Oh, I'm I'm looking at uh, I googled it
02:35:06 There's a little image of the little mascot character
02:35:12 That is a gib core design
02:35:15 Very cute. I yeah, I'll give this a listen
02:35:20 Sounds kind of neat
02:35:22 I'm almost a little more interested in this than in ghosts
02:35:26 Because it because I've never heard of this before
02:35:28 And once I've heard of something that's how I know that I'm not gonna like it
02:35:32 um, so
02:35:35 I was gonna say oh
02:35:38 Uh, you made a cute you made that cute joke. I had a bit on my last stream. I said I was really high energy and I was really like
02:35:45 Uh, a hyper I I had a
02:35:49 A thing I don't know. I made myself laugh up roriously
02:35:53 Well, that's always fun. That's always good when you know
02:35:57 I had a I had a bit that I I meant to clip it. I think I I should go back and I should clip it or something
02:36:03 Uh about how like
02:36:06 When I don't know if the story of mega man dot exe you have to
02:36:10 update hub dot bat in or and you sync your and hub's dna
02:36:15 Because your twins you sync your dna 100 and you become
02:36:19 Sinked and so though if you die in the game you die in real life. Well
02:36:23 Uh, it was like, oh, what if what if um, what if hub was circumcised?
02:36:29 And land was not and that's why hub died
02:36:31 Like hub died because of being circumcised and so your dad is like land
02:36:36 You have to you you have to run hub dot bat to complete his genetic code and sync it with you
02:36:41 But the one downside is if you do it you'll become so perfectly synced that you become circumcised just like your brother
02:36:48 It's the only way
02:36:51 The only way to save him land. You have to be circumcised
02:36:55 To update the circumcised data into your dna
02:37:01 I I I'm killing myself again
02:37:04 um
02:37:06 It's just
02:37:07 It's just your dad your dad is really fucked up your dad makes you do like he's a really he's a huge freak and he's like
02:37:13 It's really it's actually really good that dr. Light didn't have any kids in the main timeline because that guy's a fucking sick sick fuck
02:37:22 um
02:37:23 Next one is uh an image
02:37:26 And there's also a voicemail to go with it. Oh, it's a little guy. Oh, it's a little guy
02:37:31 with his little
02:37:33 orbs
02:37:34 His little orbs
02:37:36 Uh, let's listen three two one go
02:37:38 Just as an example here is one of the mascots for the song clear tummy
02:37:43 By igloo ghost
02:37:45 Cute little guy. Don't you think I feel like he is gift core. I feel like this guy. That's what you said. I'll you any day
02:37:52 Okay. Bye. Bye
02:37:55 Yes, I agree. He had he had the same
02:37:58 He had the same thought uh cool
02:38:01 Well, that's the last voicemail
02:38:03 So
02:38:04 Yeah
02:38:06 I didn't read
02:38:08 One piece
02:38:09 In fact, I'm too
02:38:11 In fact, I'm two chapters behind because I didn't read it last week either. Oh dear. Yeah, because um
02:38:19 Well, what do you you want to read it right now? Um, or
02:38:25 Is it too? I
02:38:27 I've read it so
02:38:30 You want let me just let me just check. I mean, it might be a really could really cool one
02:38:35 Yeah, I remember I'm remembering it being like like oh
02:38:41 Like a little bit of a pog moment. I see. Oh, yeah, it was definitely a pog moment. I think you should
02:38:49 Okay, so
02:38:51 Uh, I guess I'll do that right now with that. Um, yeah, okay, so let me
02:38:57 No, wait, you you you did there was a break. So there's there's no um
02:39:01 Oh, right like last week there was a break
02:39:06 Was there? I mean, I don't remember. Well, I am I'm reading the most recent chapter 1076
02:39:12 And that follows on immediately from 1075 which we did read on the show. All right, let me um
02:39:20 Oh, yeah 1076
02:39:22 It's the one with um
02:39:26 There's a double color page spread of the straw hats doing a cool poses and stuff
02:39:32 Oh
02:39:37 I'm I'm a little did I did I read 10 1075 it's the yeah the gore say
02:39:44 Standing there with the vega punk and then
02:39:47 Yeah, yeah, okay. I did I did read this one. Okay. At the end of the last one
02:39:52 it was like
02:39:53 Zorro and Luffy
02:39:55 With kaku and luchi and considering maybe letting them free because the seraphim have gone nuts
02:40:05 Yes, okay, I'm reading
02:40:08 And I'm gonna pee while you do that. Yeah, good good good
02:40:13 The the shorthand I feel like Oda's shorthand for being like
02:40:19 The coolest old guy in the world is drinking a huge amount of sake from a big plate
02:40:26 Yeah, he's always doing that that shanks what a white beard what was always doing it and now shanks is always doing it
02:40:37 I also like how
02:40:40 he draws shanks
02:40:42 without those like
02:40:44 trousers
02:40:45 That have like they go below the knee but only a little bit
02:40:49 Hmm
02:40:50 They look really comfortable, but for some reason they're also like really badass like ah, yeah
02:40:56 Uh, I mean, I think they look badass because they're on shanks. I guess I guess so
02:41:01 But I want some
02:41:03 I guess I kind of have some already
02:41:07 Imagine like a an edgy tee and being like, oh, I want to wear those those those fluffy floral pant
02:41:13 pant like long shorts that like tie up on the leg
02:41:16 I'll look like such a badass just like shanks. I always thought I always thought
02:41:22 Oda knew how to draw legs that looked comfortable to be
02:41:28 Like Luffy's shorts the whole time. It's like, why don't they sell shorts like that?
02:41:33 This look cool
02:41:36 They sell like fake like sort of scuffed jeans and all like you can roll a jean up, but like it doesn't quite work
02:41:45 They're like fluffy somehow
02:41:51 Dory and Broggy
02:41:53 What?
02:41:54 No, I mean
02:41:58 Who's that big kid?
02:42:02 Just a kid I guess looks I like that big kid looks cool
02:42:08 Do you have a message for captain kid?
02:42:10 Tell him he can either hand over his load pona griff rubbings and scram or he can risk fighting me. Hmm
02:42:16 Kid lost his arm fighting
02:42:20 Shanks's
02:42:22 fleet
02:42:23 Yeah, I don't think it was
02:42:27 I can't remember if that was like him
02:42:29 Like before time skip. He didn't have an arm. He may have had two arms and then in the time skip
02:42:37 Bunch of shit happened and he lost his arm fighting shanks's crew
02:42:40 I thought he always had the
02:42:43 Well, I know he always had the the magnet power
02:42:47 Yeah, I don't remember
02:42:51 Weird
02:42:53 This seems weird that kid lost his arm fighting against red hair shanks who has one arm what's going on
02:43:02 Is that just a coincidence?
02:43:04 Did he steal kid's arm to replace his own?
02:43:11 Kid you specifically have the just the right arm
02:43:14 It or
02:43:16 Wait a minute. I'm putting it all together
02:43:18 They were going to build the perfect white beard clone. They made uh, they made white beard's son
02:43:25 And shanks was going to donate his arm to the hideous frankenstein projects
02:43:29 But he lost it so we had to steal kid's arm to donate his instead to stitch the this man together
02:43:36 What's the way sounds legit? What's the white beard kid's name?
02:43:40 Uh
02:43:41 Eugene
02:43:43 You oh the the edward weevil we the other guy edward we've yeah weevil weevil
02:43:53 Okay, uh
02:44:03 They won't settle for an arm this time maybe the chief's coming through
02:44:08 So glad to see you youtube back then oh your protection money. We don't do that
02:44:13 They won't settle for an arm this time. They'll take your life instead only if I lose ha ha ha. Oh my god
02:44:19 Wow
02:44:22 Yeah, so it's they're fighting about this they're yeah, um
02:44:28 I
02:44:30 All right, so I caught the uh the thing
02:44:34 That they gave a me little baby me hawk the dice dice fruit
02:44:39 That's really I don't know. It's cool. I guess the idea behind each of them is they gave each one like the best fruit
02:44:44 They could that's why they gave baby ginbay
02:44:47 The the wave fruit to turn that he could swim through anything
02:44:50 And they give the best swordsmen in the world the I forgot about that
02:44:54 Yeah, and they give this guy they give him the thing that turns his whole body into a sword
02:44:59 That's awesome. Yeah, it's so fucking powerful dude
02:45:04 Yeah, cool
02:45:06 So yeah, scary shit initially
02:45:09 They're fighting the two of them the the kuma
02:45:13 Seraphim and the me hawk seraphim
02:45:16 And it's a little too much
02:45:20 And they gave yeah, the me hawk the the leg
02:45:23 Not the leg but like the um
02:45:25 The turn your whole body into a sword thing
02:45:28 Dice dice the dice dice fruit. Yeah
02:45:31 And so they agree
02:45:34 Uh to let him out. I like how luchi is not trying to be subtle at all
02:45:40 Like he he's not he's not the kind of person
02:45:43 to like
02:45:44 scheme I guess
02:45:46 He's just gonna say I'll kill you
02:45:49 I'll work with you now and then I'll try and kill you afterwards
02:45:54 Oh, I'll kill you. Oh, I'll kill you all right. Yeah, uh, it's like help us help us uh
02:46:01 Help us get these guys and then let us put you the handcuffs back on okay
02:46:10 They're like, yeah, sure. Yeah, whatever
02:46:13 Yeah, of course
02:46:14 And he's so proud he he like
02:46:17 Is easily
02:46:19 Is easily got by the the insinuation that he's like it would be a cow and a sore loser if he didn't yeah
02:46:26 Yeah, you can't beat me so after this you got to fight me
02:46:31 and
02:46:34 You know
02:46:35 Once, you know, if you win if you beat me then whatever but like, you know, you can't beat me
02:46:40 So you can't you can't just do whatever you want. You got to fight me first
02:46:43 It's the same fight you it's similar. I guess to that moment when
02:46:48 He fought alki g the first time
02:46:51 And he said like Luffy alkegi. Yeah, Luffy fought alkegi and he got turned to ice
02:46:56 But because it was like a one-on-one duel he sort of like
02:47:00 Protected his friends by making it about like just them
02:47:05 And alkegi was like her. I guess I can't kill everyone
02:47:08 Like I plan to that's pretty cool. You got me
02:47:12 I
02:47:13 I forget exactly how I don't really remember what he was sort of like an like an honorable duel sort of situation
02:47:21 In order to protect his crew
02:47:26 But this time is a little more low stakes because luchi can't be luffy
02:47:32 He probably can't I mean didn't didn't they just lose didn't luchi like just get owned
02:47:38 He did
02:47:39 Yeah, so I don't know
02:47:41 But he did come back. It wasn't like he was at the brink of death. He came back with the through with the
02:47:47 With kaku and stussy
02:47:49 at the top
02:47:51 after they had retreated to
02:47:54 To the egg area or whatever it's called
02:48:00 So they're all right, they've temporarily joined forces against uh
02:48:05 Frickin, I think it's just the the me hawk and the kuma
02:48:09 sarah phim
02:48:11 It looks so cool
02:48:12 Then doing their their big attacks at the same time. Oh, yeah
02:48:16 And of course kaku was like a swordsman. So it's like
02:48:20 So it's their enemies. They're one-on-one enemies
02:48:24 But together
02:48:26 It's like crack for me six king gun
02:48:31 Yeah, luffy and luffy and luchi fighting together and uh, uh, zoro and kaku fighting together
02:48:40 I love I love kaku the fight the the zora versus kaku was one of my favorites of the whole series
02:48:46 yeah
02:48:47 The whole like fucking cutting through
02:48:50 The any's lobby tower and then it was like slowly shifting the entire time after that
02:48:56 Yeah, I just liked him him using his like giant
02:49:00 giraffe
02:49:01 body so like
02:49:04 You can't outreach me. I'm everywhere
02:49:10 I can't wait to see it return. I can't beat a neck that long
02:49:15 There's no what do you even do against a neck like that?
02:49:20 Slice it I don't think so
02:49:23 Uh, so so then then we're in some sort of containment chamber
02:49:30 With a bunch of government intelligence agents
02:49:35 Yeah
02:49:36 From various crestinator podcast
02:49:39 Uh, ha ha ha true
02:49:41 various make clones. Yeah
02:49:44 and um
02:49:46 So it seems two months back when we were meant to set sail
02:49:49 The weaponized seabees attacked us. We were brought to the island
02:49:52 Then other game agents came so two months ago something was going on
02:49:57 Agents were being captured and held in prison
02:50:01 And then other agents that were sent to get them were held in prison, which is probably why cp0 is here
02:50:08 Yeah
02:50:09 In some in some fashion because because to them this is like oh, they thought vega punk was
02:50:15 Doing this capturing cp9 agents and just hold they thought they thought he was pulling a trade federation from the start of phantom menace
02:50:23 When they were just like catching. Oh, you sent your goons to come and inspect us. Well, we'll fucking
02:50:29 Trap him and murder him. We'll gas him
02:50:32 uh
02:50:33 But he says he
02:50:35 Is not the one behind it. He had no idea and now he's in here
02:50:40 and wasn't he
02:50:42 I'm sorry. Wasn't he like a baby?
02:50:46 Moments ago. Yes
02:50:47 He what well moments
02:50:49 It's been a bit a few minutes. There was that everyone split up
02:50:54 And go look for vega punk. So he's been gone for a little while
02:50:58 But yeah, bonnie
02:50:59 Took his age out and turned it into funny little shapes
02:51:03 Right as one does
02:51:05 And I guess he got those back at some point
02:51:08 Yeah, and is now locked up after getting punched
02:51:14 probably
02:51:15 By bonnie, I guess. I mean, I can't think oh, yeah, he's like bleeding, right? Yeah
02:51:20 Yeah, he's got he got beat up and locked here and now he's learning about this thing going on
02:51:26 Um, damn
02:51:28 They said vega punk could see everything
02:51:31 Kid knows everything, but does he know why kids love the taste of cinnamon toast cream?
02:51:35 I mean why they're locking my captain kids like the taste
02:51:39 Yeah
02:51:41 Uh, he didn't he didn't even know is happening under his own nose some some genius
02:51:47 um
02:51:48 Yeah, so it's it's
02:51:50 One thing so who so I've no idea who the fuck could possibly I mean, I guess someone is is running things over
02:51:57 Maybe it was that shadowy figure that we saw
02:52:00 looming over one of the vega punks
02:52:03 before I thought that was just like a
02:52:06 a hint of the seraphim
02:52:09 Yeah, maybe it was just one of the seraphim. I didn't didn't we
02:52:12 Wasn't there like a like a dark figure with like glowing eyes and we were like not sure
02:52:17 I was and it might
02:52:19 Or might not have been a seraphim
02:52:22 Uh, I guess we could go back and check. I felt like that was like, oh, there's something going on here
02:52:28 What's the mystery and it's oh, it's the seraphim but like
02:52:31 Yeah, there's another person that was not revealed in that moment
02:52:34 That is probably the person who is now being referred to as leaking data to the world government
02:52:40 Yeah
02:52:42 And and all of the reasons that like vega punks like research is being outed
02:52:47 Um, the stuff that obviously he wouldn't let this slip himself
02:52:51 Stuff that would get the world government to to fucking send warships to kill him
02:52:57 Um, so yeah, somebody's been leaking stuff
02:53:01 And I guess
02:53:03 Who?
02:53:05 Is there anyone currently that we know about who it could be do you think?
02:53:11 Santomaru
02:53:13 I mean, why would he do it?
02:53:15 I don't know. He was already like
02:53:18 marine affiliated, but he was like loyal to vega punk
02:53:22 Yeah, we've learned
02:53:24 Because he was rescued like a as a baby or something
02:53:28 I mean
02:53:29 Who have we seen that hasn't I'm just trying to think of who has any authority on egghead?
02:53:33 I mean vega punks the guy and then there's like his seven
02:53:37 Clones or whatever and their sentomaru is like his direct underling
02:53:42 And then there's stussy who was a cp0 agent. Well, stussy just got here. I know but like
02:53:50 How do we know that? I don't fucking know. That's not that's not a good that's not a good theory. Um
02:53:58 She's just suspicious. I guess these guys have been here for two months
02:54:02 So someone's been here for a while. Yes, either somebody who's just not been introduced yet
02:54:08 Yeah, or it could be one of the vega punk like robots
02:54:14 Maybe maybe one could one of them be rogue and the other's not I think no
02:54:20 It could be but then like what's the seraphim doing killing the vega punks?
02:54:26 You know, but is he killing all of them? Maybe he's is there one that like maybe hasn't been attacked
02:54:35 But don't well all the vega punks know everything that all the other vega punks know
02:54:39 Yeah, that's the only thing that's a little weird. I guess we don't know exactly how it works
02:54:44 But that's how it's been explained is that they share
02:54:47 They share data
02:54:49 Yeah, I guess they don't necessarily share experiences because one of them
02:54:54 will have like
02:54:56 Thoughts like they'll see something and they'll have to report it by speaking to the others
02:55:02 Oh, so like you think they can have
02:55:05 Their own individual like thoughts about stuff and the others. It's just like information they learn
02:55:11 Yeah, I mean maybe yeah
02:55:14 Because like a thought in your head is not like something you see or hear or whatever. So maybe that stuff is not
02:55:22 transmitted
02:55:24 Yeah, it could be
02:55:27 I don't know. Lilith is evil. Lilith is just evil. Lilith is the evil one
02:55:33 But I mean she was with the others and she was being attacked with them
02:55:39 I mean the the most surprising one would be if it was shaka
02:55:42 But number one. Yeah
02:55:46 I feel like he's got more power to do that because he's like the guy who looks at all the information
02:55:51 He says things to everyone about what's happening
02:55:55 He seems the most on the level
02:55:58 Which is why it's like it would be the most he seems like the least likely candidate
02:56:02 But that makes him probably my first guess if it is one of them, it's probably him
02:56:09 Yeah, so
02:56:11 I guess at the moment we don't have much to go on other than the fact that not really where is bonnie
02:56:16 Um, and what did she learn when she got the kuma thing?
02:56:20 Did she learn more? Why is she not here? Did she do anything bad?
02:56:25 Where'd she go?
02:56:28 Because if there was a bad guy if there was a bad guy that was orchestrating all of this for two months
02:56:33 And then they found vega punk beat him up and locked him up here
02:56:38 Did they not find bonnie either?
02:56:41 Is bonnie just somewhere else?
02:56:48 I think I think the fact that yeah, I think they I think they probably
02:56:52 Split up. I think bonnie and vega punk must have split up and then vega punk was taken in
02:57:00 I mean, this is all happening. This is like happening pretty fast. Yeah
02:57:04 Uh, so like they're probably still look whoever is doing this probably is looking for
02:57:10 Bonnie or maybe they decided that bonnie is fine and they can let bonnie go
02:57:16 Yeah, I think it might be shaka. That's my this is my theory but it's only because
02:57:22 When they lost track of vega punk and bonnie
02:57:25 He was the one who was looking at the monitors and saying, oh, we don't know where they are
02:57:29 Everyone's split up
02:57:31 And everyone just agreed that he is calling the shots. So he would be the one who could
02:57:37 Throw everything direct people. Yeah. Yeah, definitely
02:57:41 I mean, I have no idea. I have no idea why he would do that but like
02:57:45 We don't know anything about him other than that. He is vega punk sort of and he is
02:57:52 In charge
02:57:54 Yeah, and also the seraphim
02:57:56 They weren't necessarily attacking him in that room. They were attacking the cp zero and luffy and zoro
02:58:03 There's enough other people there that they weren't just attacking him. So maybe he was like on the white list
02:58:09 Yeah, but you wouldn't notice
02:58:11 Yeah, he's he's he's I would say he's my suspect number one. Yeah, just because he has the most opportunity to do it
02:58:22 Uh
02:58:24 And it would have to entail that like some yeah, there's there's some
02:58:28 Either they don't actually know everything that all the other vega punks know or there's some mech mechanism by which one can hide something from the others
02:58:35 But I mean, uh, yeah outside of that or maybe sentomaru, I can't think of anyone else who would be
02:58:43 Doing some weird
02:58:45 Betrayal over like a long period of time
02:58:52 Well unless unless vega punk is just actually what if he's just lying
02:58:56 What if he's actually just lying and he put himself in jail and uh, he's he is bad and the mastermind
02:59:02 And all of them are are just playing a big long con
02:59:09 You know, it's possible. I just feel like
02:59:13 It would be a shame
02:59:15 If like vega punk was a bad guy this whole time
02:59:18 I agree
02:59:21 But what if I don't want daft punk to be evil we'll have to have to kill daft punk
02:59:27 Maybe he's not a daft punk after all. Maybe he's a sensible punk
02:59:32 What if he takes his head mask off and underneath is like
02:59:37 She's got some kind of fucked up. She's got some fucked up comedic villain face underneath
02:59:42 He's got some
02:59:44 big teeth or something
02:59:45 Yeah, like he's resentful for dr. Vega punk for making him ugly so that he needs to wear a mask
02:59:51 Yeah, you made all the other vega punks look nice. Well, what about me, huh?
02:59:55 That's why I started
02:59:57 spying on you and taking your secrets
03:00:00 Hmm. Yep
03:00:02 And vega punk nods and says, yep, that's exactly what I would have done. I should have known
03:00:06 In that situation, I would have behaved exactly the same way
03:00:11 Uh
03:00:14 And then uh, I guess we're on to yeah kid and
03:00:18 freaking kid and shanks at albath
03:00:21 the giant island
03:00:23 So shanks wants the pony glyph rubbing
03:00:26 and kid has one
03:00:29 and um
03:00:33 They're gonna freaking fight about it
03:00:36 Oh, this is cute. I've just realized um shanks and this giant kid
03:00:41 It's the same as when luffy was a kid and shanks is at the bar
03:00:46 and shanks is like drinking all his pirate friends and
03:00:49 Luffy's like, oh, come on. Take me with you. Come on. Take me with you on a cruise on a pirate adventure
03:00:55 And now shanks is saying that to this this giant kid
03:00:58 The same thing was the kid asking. Oh, yeah, there's no way I'd bring a hotheaded kid like you
03:01:06 Wait, this is is this a giant kid?
03:01:08 Yeah, it's a giant. Oh, these are the islands of giants. Oh, they're all giants
03:01:13 And oh, that's that's why the sake plate is huge and that's why the the blueberries are giant. Okay, this makes
03:01:20 Yeah, it all makes perfect sense now because like last time we heard about alba
03:01:24 Elbeth was um because kid had found it. He found albeth
03:01:30 And maybe he found it because he was looking for shanks
03:01:33 Because shanks was there
03:01:36 And so kid captain kid is fighting shanks his crew or is like causing trouble
03:01:44 And shanks is like, oh, well, I guess we got to go say hello
03:01:48 Oh
03:01:49 So
03:01:50 Is kid is kid the aggressor here? Is he like attacking shanks's fleet?
03:01:54 Is he trying to like get somewhere and shanks is blocking him?
03:01:59 I think um
03:02:01 It's likely that kid is the aggressor just because that's what kid is like and
03:02:06 seeing as he has a
03:02:07 a history of a shanks
03:02:10 He probably wants to take down shanks in the same way that he and law took down big mom and like everyone took down
03:02:17 Kaido and all that. It's like he's one of the the yonko. He's a target
03:02:23 Hey, look at this. Uh, I mean, what do you make of?
03:02:27 in this panel
03:02:29 This panel of um elbeth. I mean just look at the way that the island looks there's like a big
03:02:36 black like
03:02:37 pillar
03:02:39 I would say that's tree. That's like a giant tree
03:02:43 Hmm
03:02:45 Perhaps a world tree perhaps a yeeg dressil
03:02:48 That's a classic Norse thing along with vikings and giants. Oh, yeah
03:02:53 That's a good point
03:02:55 I I looked at the the the way that the island looks and I thought it kind of looked like
03:02:59 Fire and ice island or whatever that was called like it looked like some of these mountains were like melted glass or something
03:03:06 Yeah, maybe it's just a huge tree a huge huge world tree that would
03:03:10 Either that or it's like a huge
03:03:12 Viking elbeth giant castle the the the texture on it does look like bark
03:03:19 Now that you say that no, I think you're right. I think you've hit the nail on the head there
03:03:24 And then wait wait wait actually if you look up above the ships
03:03:28 Like above the ships there are like sort of uh screen tone like gray
03:03:33 Oh, yeah, there's like pillars like further away. Maybe it's many trees
03:03:37 I think these are just I think these might be giant trees
03:03:40 Yeah, is this like adam wood?
03:03:44 Oh, remember that being like the special words that the that was used to make gold rogership and then frankie bought the thousands
03:03:51 Yeah
03:03:53 Do these could be adam trees?
03:03:55 uh, did we
03:03:58 Do we know does like that come from elba?
03:04:01 I don't think
03:04:03 Comes from anywhere in particular, but we just know that that's a type of tree that's got like the best wood
03:04:09 And it's probably the big tree
03:04:13 Probably the giantest of trees
03:04:16 Okay, okay, just a just a just an idea. Okay, it's
03:04:19 Wait a minute. Wait a minute adam treasure tree adam is a type of tree whose wood is considered the strongest
03:04:26 It's immense rarity makes it highly valuable
03:04:30 Uh
03:04:34 Okay, no
03:04:37 Uh
03:04:39 No, I think I think we've seen adam trees
03:04:43 I mean here here's a screenshot that supposedly has one in it and this is from the anime
03:04:48 But supposedly this is a screenshot of a treasure tree adam
03:04:52 And it's normal size. Oh
03:04:54 does that that that looks like the one that um
03:04:58 Uh, niko robin and the the librarians of ohara had is that that kind of tree? Oh, um
03:05:08 I don't
03:05:10 I don't I don't know
03:05:12 probably not
03:05:14 ohara
03:05:17 I mean I had a huge fucking tree. Yeah, this is what ohara looked like
03:05:21 They built a library on the inside of it
03:05:24 I think
03:05:28 Frankie explained the history of this one of a kind. Oh wait. No, there's only one
03:05:32 There's only one treasure tree adam
03:05:36 What
03:05:37 Frankie explained the history of this one of a kind tree long long ago an endless war raged on an island
03:05:42 People died and the island was destroyed by a rain of bullets and left in ruins. However, the people kept coming back to rebuild
03:05:48 the nation near a giant tree
03:05:50 A giant tree the only one that remained intact and that was adam
03:05:55 Adam
03:05:56 So that big tree could be adam
03:06:00 There is apparently also a sunlight tree eve on fishman island. Yes, and that's what and that's what lets the light
03:06:07 Come down through the red line
03:06:11 Through its roots to illuminate fishman island. Do you remember that?
03:06:16 Uh
03:06:18 That's why there's light. That's why there's light in fit. That's why there's light in fishman island. I remember
03:06:23 Uh
03:06:24 And us up. Yeah, and and us up was like treasure sunlight tree eve. Is that like the treasure tree adam?
03:06:33 Fascinating
03:06:36 We have to know more
03:06:39 Uh, so yeah, shanks is having a party is drinking and eating with the giants in the bar
03:06:46 And uh
03:06:48 That he's gonna go
03:06:51 Because one piece is just so boring
03:06:54 He's gonna go deal with kid
03:06:56 Um, and he says hey, uh, dory broggy. Can you lend me a hand? And I also notice
03:07:01 Uh, oi mo and kashi from any's lobby is behind them
03:07:05 as well
03:07:06 Remember those guys
03:07:10 I do remember those guys were on
03:07:13 They were on some other island before they were on any's lobby. Um, yeah. Yeah. Yeah
03:07:18 They were like tricked into
03:07:21 Being
03:07:22 Allied with the marines for some reason they said they were like tricked
03:07:26 Um by the marines saying dory and broggy were captured and they had to do this
03:07:31 But then us up told them that they met dory and broggy and they're fine
03:07:35 And so they turned the tables
03:07:38 They became friends of the straw hats
03:07:42 Yo
03:07:44 It's so cool
03:07:46 How much stuff how much elba for we're getting nowadays
03:07:50 Yes, this is the next big arc. Yeah, this is the one we're we're we're
03:07:56 We're moving towards the elba far egg egghead is like part of it
03:08:06 Who do you think's gonna win between kid and shanks, uh, I mean
03:08:12 Shanks obviously has more strength and the backing of the giants is obviously gonna do a lot
03:08:19 Yeah, kid is not as tough as he thinks he is
03:08:23 But he's got he's got uh hootspah, you know, he's got gusto definitely definitely and he's got uh
03:08:32 I mean killer is uh
03:08:34 I mean, he's got a history honestly of like of picking fights that he can't win
03:08:39 He picked he picked a fight with kaito and that resulted in him being imprisoned
03:08:44 Yeah, true. It didn't he and he was uh, who was who else was he fighting on?
03:08:50 Was he he fought other people on the on the kaito island? Or am I just did did he end up fighting?
03:08:57 Uh, uh, the the the wicker basket guy
03:09:01 Hawk
03:09:02 Basil Hawkins basil Hawkins or was that killer that fought basil Hawkins
03:09:09 I think
03:09:11 That's a new number of people
03:09:14 I can't actually remember who it was that did the final fight or was it Diaz or was it Diaz drake that fought basil Hawkins
03:09:21 Everyone fought him who has fought basil Hawkins at this point
03:09:27 Such a weak boy a little bit cool hair though
03:09:33 Yeah, so
03:09:35 He he fought kaito and he got imprisoned
03:09:38 And he got rescued by luffy and whatever was going on in that prison break
03:09:45 Um, and he's like, yeah, fuck you. I don't care about you, but let's team up anyway and kill kaito and all that
03:09:52 Hell yeah
03:09:54 He clearly is coming here with a chip on his shoulder or should I say a lack of a shoulder?
03:10:01 His chip on his one shoulder
03:10:04 Ah
03:10:07 I mean
03:10:08 He's still got a shoulder
03:10:10 So, yeah, this this is implying that there's gonna be a fight because of course kid would not
03:10:15 Give them the the poneglas rubbings
03:10:19 Um shanks getting getting bitches
03:10:22 You have to see a couple panels of shanks getting bitches and drinking a huge plate of sake to know
03:10:27 This is the who are these women that are like jumping on them because they're not giants
03:10:32 Um, well earlier shanks said something like
03:10:36 How do you say? I guess I lost track of time catching up with everyone
03:10:41 um, maybe it's more than just the giants he's catching up with maybe there's like
03:10:46 Like other members of his like grand fleet if he has that i'm sure he has a grand fleet
03:10:50 We just haven't heard too much about them because why if they had had like a fleet of different pirates that would loyal to whitebeard
03:10:58 And uh
03:11:00 I guess luffy has that as well
03:11:05 Uh, yeah, yeah, like bar the bar not bartholomew
03:11:09 um
03:11:10 What's the name of his bartholomeo bartholomeo his his underling speaking of bartholomeo
03:11:16 um, you might not remember but there was a point where
03:11:20 He declared war on shanks under the straw hat flag. Oh god. No when
03:11:27 Why it was it was in a cover like arc
03:11:31 Bartholomeo was doing some stuff
03:11:33 after dress rosa and then
03:11:35 he took over a town and he
03:11:38 Set fire to shanks his flag and put the straw hat flag there in its place
03:11:43 and then later
03:11:45 This event was referenced by the the the red-haired pirates
03:11:51 at the end of wano
03:11:52 When they could have gone and seen luffy, but they didn't I think shanks just did like a a hacky from across the sea
03:12:01 And then they left
03:12:03 Just a sense that luffy was there
03:12:07 I can't remember exactly. I think yeah, he did he did a hacky
03:12:11 to the the the green bullet the green bowl
03:12:15 Admiral who was there causing trouble
03:12:18 Hmm
03:12:19 He was like turning into a giant tree and he was trying to fight and and momonosuke was like saying no, you can't come here
03:12:26 This is my kingdom or whatever
03:12:29 And luffy was watching saying yeah, you go momonosuke, but then shanks did a whole big electric hacky conquerors hacky thing
03:12:37 To the admiral and then luffy could feel it. It's like that sound that feels familiar that hacky. I'm sorry
03:12:44 so you're saying
03:12:45 the green admiral showed up
03:12:47 And then shanks just like from all the way across the ocean like
03:12:51 Disabled not all the way across the ocean. He was his ship was like at the edge of
03:12:56 wano
03:12:57 But yeah, it was a long way. It was like silly amount of distance. You couldn't see weird shanks. I
03:13:03 Kind of I don't know how shanks could see the admiral, but whatever and that was at the very end of wano, right?
03:13:09 That was a very end of wano. Yeah. Yeah after they've beaten everyone
03:13:12 And so they I think somebody mentioned that that does ring a bell
03:13:16 We can't see luffy yet
03:13:18 um
03:13:19 And also we can't forget about that thing that happened with the bartolomeo guy
03:13:25 We don't know. I don't think we know what happened to bartolomeo
03:13:29 um, but clearly
03:13:32 That's gonna have to be resolved I guess
03:13:37 True
03:13:41 Uh
03:13:44 I mean, I'm sure that shanks probably understands that bartolomeo is
03:13:50 an unruly vassal
03:13:52 And is acting on his own
03:13:54 Volition this is this is the part. I think where we'll we see
03:13:59 shanks having to be
03:14:01 ruthless because
03:14:03 If he's got a fight kid
03:14:06 Like I don't know if he's gonna be like nice about it
03:14:11 I
03:14:12 Yeah, I don't really see any reason why he should be
03:14:18 So that'll be cool. This is yeah, this is shanks like
03:14:22 Yeah, when he's not in nice guy mode he might
03:14:26 He might uh, be really
03:14:29 Fucking
03:14:30 He might even be a big meeting to this guy who's fucking attacking his ships
03:14:36 There's also the thing with um, like at the end of wano during that combo
03:14:40 Where shanks did the hacky and everything he said to beckman. Hey, isn't it time we claimed the one piece?
03:14:47 So that's what shanks is doing now. He's shanks is no longer just hanging out. That's so funny to just casually be like, hey
03:14:53 I feel like uh, you know
03:14:55 This comic's been going on for uh, uh, 28 years now. I think it's about time. We got the one piece
03:15:01 I think we should be moving we should be moving in that direction in my he's moving and shaking
03:15:06 It's it's about don't you think it's about time we got the fuck on with it
03:15:11 Um, let's go. He's just doing it. I do remember that he's gonna kid. He's gonna kill or severely
03:15:17 Mame kid and take his other arm
03:15:20 And and he's gonna have the pona cliff rubbings and then it will be like
03:15:25 Shanks
03:15:26 Might go after law next
03:15:28 Because law has another one of the rubbings
03:15:31 Yeah, so it'll be like
03:15:33 What and then it'll be he'll have to come for luffy after that
03:15:37 Does luffy have a they must have several rubbings at this point? Yeah, luffy only needs one more. I think yeah
03:15:45 Yeah, I guess
03:15:48 I guess if shanks is serious, he's gonna have to come after those rubbings
03:15:52 So
03:15:55 That'll be cool. That'll be exciting
03:15:58 Um, it's an airplane in my my noise. I don't know if that got noise removed
03:16:03 I think I heard a little buzz. Here's a question
03:16:07 Would would shanks have gone and after kids rubbing
03:16:12 If kid was not like already attacking his fleet or was it just like it just it just so happens that this kid guy is
03:16:19 Attacking my ships. Well, I'm gonna fucking get him and I'm gonna take his rubbing because I need that
03:16:27 um
03:16:28 You know
03:16:29 I think based on the fact that he's going after the one piece
03:16:33 he may be
03:16:35 Landing at albath after a kid because we know kid saw albath and there was no sign of like
03:16:42 Pirates being there. Oh, yeah
03:16:45 So maybe kid was in the area and now shanks has arrived and he's just gone up to the pirates and say hey bros
03:16:51 Remember me and everyone's like, how the hell yeah shanks
03:16:55 And he's sort of muscling in on the territory. He's just having a drink casually and then he's go, okay
03:17:00 Let's go get that shit now. Let's go kill kid
03:17:04 Knock him on the head. Right. Yeah. Yeah, he's he seems
03:17:09 That makes sense and it would be that like yeah, he's no he's he's actively
03:17:13 Going after people that have rubbings
03:17:16 He needs those rubbings. It's time to get the one piece. Oof
03:17:20 That's exciting
03:17:22 That's that's awesome
03:17:24 Uh, I'm freaking I'm freaking
03:17:29 This is a big pog chapter
03:17:32 Most a lot of these chapters have been pog
03:17:35 It's so like
03:17:38 It really feels like
03:17:41 It really feels like things are slotting into place for like
03:17:45 a real like momentous
03:17:48 battle or or uh
03:17:51 Something's gonna happen things are moving
03:17:55 I'm excited
03:17:58 Uh, yeah, can't wait for next week too bad. There was a bi-week
03:18:04 Yes break next week
03:18:07 It's a break next week too. Yeah, right at the bottom. It says that
03:18:11 Oh, right. Right. Right. But like by next week, they'll by our next week. There will probably be another one
03:18:17 Probably uh, I don't know. I don't think so
03:18:20 Well, I well actually I don't remember if this one was out last week or not
03:18:26 Was this was this new I don't think this was out last this is new I think okay
03:18:32 Um
03:18:35 There's gonna be some yeah, he's gonna he's gonna steal kid's arm or he's gonna maybe he'll take maybe he'll take his robotic arm
03:18:41 Maybe he'll be nice and take his robotic
03:18:44 No, no, I probably wouldn't do that
03:18:47 Like I mean he can't do that because right because it's all together with his yeah
03:18:52 You just make another one. What if he is like, hey kid, you're a machine
03:18:56 Magnet man, could you like build me an arm like that and I could just take it with me and like that would be cool
03:19:01 Maybe they'll become friends and kid will make shanks a robotic arm
03:19:05 Wouldn't wouldn't that be nice
03:19:08 Uh
