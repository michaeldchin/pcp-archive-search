00:00:00 I won't bless that guy that son of a bitch.
00:00:11 Welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. It's Ben Saint and Gibbontake.
00:00:21 I just attacked Ben with a red hot poker.
00:00:24 Yeah, yeah, you know how it is
00:00:30 Do you have something you wanted to start with well, I was gonna ask you about phantom's revenge cuz I was sure yeah phantom's revenge is out
00:00:40 You played it I did played it you played it and I watched you stream it and it was
00:00:47 So fun watching you figure it out in real time
00:00:52 I
00:00:53 Had a I re I rewatched most of the stream cuz I just liked it that much. Oh
00:00:58 Wow, yeah, I know it was great
00:01:02 Well, I'm glad to have been the perfect
00:01:06 Gamer for that one the perfect gamer you I think you you told me that you
00:01:13 Eventually you didn't beat it on stream, but you said it took you like three more tries
00:01:17 Which meant that you took like six tries total
00:01:20 Like so seven. Yeah, some of my bad
00:01:23 I think that's less than most people, but you really took your time with it like you really like
00:01:29 Took a while for each run and you were like unpacking after every move and like really like carefully choosing
00:01:36 Your next decision
00:01:38 It was because I had played the demo and that was like
00:01:42 The point of the demo is that you have to find out the one
00:01:46 Way to beat it. Yeah
00:01:48 And so every single thing you do is like that could end the run if you don't know what you're doing
00:01:53 Yeah, if you don't think about what you're doing. Yeah, I came into the the game with the right mindset
00:01:59 Yeah, I have I don't know. I might have told you this
00:02:02 I've definitely told some people on Twitter this but um, you know the demo was like really hard to the point that you basically
00:02:09 Couldn't win unless you did exactly the right
00:02:13 Moves every time every turn
00:02:17 The the the game as the final game is not quite like that. It's still pretty hard
00:02:22 You got to know what you're doing. You can't fuck around, but there is some leeway in there
00:02:26 You can you can make a few suboptimal decisions, but if you play it optimally 100%
00:02:33 there is a
00:02:35 Wind condition in there. There's something you can do in there that is as hard as the demo was
00:02:42 Which is to say there's only one way to do it
00:02:46 Specifically that is getting to the end without letting Virginia take any damage
00:02:51 You can you can keep Virginia completely safe through the whole thing if you do everything 100%
00:02:58 Correct and not yeah
00:03:00 Yeah
00:03:01 Well, well one one person actually did it like sauce pirate
00:03:07 seemingly by accident or maybe maybe just a
00:03:10 They just
00:03:12 Figured it out and just have just happened to do it the right way or something
00:03:16 But yeah, they they they did it that way and I was like wow. I almost and I kind of didn't expect anyone to do it like that
00:03:22 I
00:03:23 Feel like once you know
00:03:26 How long the game is yeah, and like what is expected of you to win?
00:03:32 Yeah
00:03:33 Because I think one of the playthroughs
00:03:35 I don't know whether this was on stream or off stream, but I did like optimal plays. I kept Virginia alive
00:03:40 I got to the end and I'm like, okay. I
00:03:43 have a
00:03:44 ton of slime
00:03:46 That is not useful
00:03:48 Because the amount of damage I will take and the amount of attacks I need to perform. Yeah, do not like deplete it
00:03:55 That much and I can't use it to level up because all my poisons are gone. So that that number is
00:04:02 Like excess slime I can use elsewhere earlier in the run. You mean after the after the big room
00:04:11 Yeah, after the big room or at some point near the end where it's like yeah
00:04:16 calculating the amount of
00:04:18 Slime I need and I had excess so I knew yeah that I could use that excess earlier in the run to save on like
00:04:27 oh
00:04:28 No, I think it was like I realized that I could afford to level up earlier and
00:04:33 Then that excess slime will be used up by my attacks
00:04:36 Right, and then it was like it was those sorts of realizations that were fun, right? Yeah. Yeah seeing you
00:04:44 Seeing you like figure something out like oh wait a minute like oh if I oh
00:04:50 I actually have to dab like if I dab it actually saves slime because then Virginia does the attacks
00:04:55 And I don't have to spend it just like kind of kind of seeing you
00:04:59 Like go from room to room and then in in a particular room
00:05:04 There were there were a couple of times when I was like
00:05:07 This is exactly what I wanted the player to feel like I wanted like I wanted them to get here and die in this specific way
00:05:14 And realize oh I can't do that what I have to do is this instead, and then I won't die there
00:05:23 The
00:05:26 There are
00:05:28 Yeah, so when I when I I added them the anoint command for leveling your weapon up
00:05:35 and and
00:05:37 Weapon marriage I added them in like a later update kind of just as like a
00:05:42 Joke basically like I added them thinking that they wouldn't even like do anything
00:05:48 But it turns out it created like a completely separate way that you can win
00:05:53 Like I didn't even intend for this to be it to be the case, but it turns out you actually
00:05:58 Well, I made the game thinking you would have to level up to win
00:06:01 But with anoint in the game you actually don't have to level up anymore
00:06:04 You can level up just only by anointing and without level you or you can win with only anointing and not leveling up
00:06:11 I didn't even mean for that to be the case, but it turns out it is and that's okay
00:06:17 I'm not sure which is like easier. I think it's just like whichever one you kind of
00:06:22 figure out first
00:06:24 Ends up being the way to do it, but they both work
00:06:29 I just think that's pretty funny because I think I didn't mean for it to be useful, but it is
00:06:36 That's like a lot of games
00:06:38 Yeah, they don't they don't have like a one win condition
00:06:42 They have like a bunch of systems that can interact in so many possible
00:06:46 Permutations the game designer couldn't possibly like account for every possible way
00:06:50 Yeah, I thought because leveling up gives you boost your damage more than
00:06:57 than
00:06:58 Anointing I thought that anointing would not boost it enough to meaningfully make a difference, but it turns out it did
00:07:10 So
00:07:11 Yeah, I am I've been watching my itch
00:07:15 analytics and
00:07:17 I
00:07:18 Was pleased to see that the game got a little boost the other day from being featured on Equestria daily
00:07:27 Yeah, a
00:07:30 Lot of people saw that and we're like I can't believe Equestria daily is still
00:07:34 Still posting I can't believe that sethisto
00:07:39 Yeah, I don't know much about what he knows
00:07:43 Okay, it's such an odd thing to put this like Justin does it
00:07:46 I don't know if he does like OC things a lot. Maybe he does. I mean
00:07:51 Well, you remember how it was back in the day, right? I
00:07:55 Mean back in the day if you made anything pony related
00:07:59 You would get like I feel like it had to at least be like relating to the show
00:08:04 Like your thing is almost entirely your own OC and a bunch of slime and
00:08:10 It's like it's barely anything to do with my little pony. That's true. You know on the one hand
00:08:17 You're totally right on the other hand. I really feel like I
00:08:22 Like I just said that back in the day they would host like
00:08:25 anything pony
00:08:28 It's got how much it's got it's got to be drier
00:08:30 Like the wells got to have run even drier these days, right? Like the brony fandom has reduced significantly
00:08:36 There's got to be less to go around. I feel like they'd be hungrier than ever
00:08:40 um, I suppose so but I mean
00:08:44 You're right though. They weren't gonna do it. I'm sure I added sethisto on Twitter just to see if I could maybe entice him and
00:08:51 Nothing happened right away
00:08:53 And then oblivion fall told me that he like emailed sethisto and like asked
00:08:59 Are he say I don't I don't know if he I don't know if he
00:09:03 Just like recommended it like hey look at this game or if he said like hey so that hey sethisto
00:09:09 Please you know you and I we go back, you know, we're we're best friends, uh, please as a personal favorite
00:09:15 I know it's embarrassing. I know Ben Saint is like a is like a weird freak and nobody would
00:09:22 Nor is ordinary circumstances want to be associated with please please let me call you know
00:09:27 I you know, I gave you my kidney that one time you were you know dying of alcohol poisoning
00:09:33 And you needed a new a new some new organs like please just I'm trying to call it in that favor now
00:09:39 Please just feature Ben Saint stupid little slime game on your pony website. Thank you and good night. I
00:09:46 Don't know which of those two things happened
00:09:48 I mean, I feel like Seth has always been consistently pretty cool. I
00:09:53 So like I'm sure I'm sure once it's been brought to his attention. He'd read it out like the blurb
00:09:59 I mean, wow, this is pretty funny. I mean, I look up ponies like I think I can see him just being like, oh cool
00:10:05 I don't really know any what he's like at all. So maybe you're right. I just I got no idea
00:10:11 I would think of you. Yeah, there was a blurb on the site that
00:10:16 Seemed it's see, I don't know. I guess he wrote it
00:10:22 So and it seemed like pretty genuinely appreciative of it. So yeah, maybe he saw it was like, uh, lol, what is this?
00:10:29 Which should be cool
00:10:32 Yeah, I'm joking about the the other option
00:10:36 I'm joking with the liver, but if Clayson wasn't clear, I don't think that that actually I don't think that that actually happened
00:10:42 Although I can't prove that it didn't
00:10:45 Um
00:10:46 Yes, and then um, I yeah, uh, oh, yeah side cyber shell played the game and posted his results
00:10:53 And I asked him if you wanted to come on this episode. He said he couldn't make it this week, but it will have him on
00:10:59 Someday one of these days soon and I'll ask him. I don't know to tell me that the game is good
00:11:07 And then he will
00:11:10 Uh, any oh, yeah, anyway, check it check out check out my analytics. Let's look at these analytics in the general
00:11:19 There they are. What flag is that? I think it's uh, is it bisexual?
00:11:25 Let's say it looks like one of those four different purples. It's like super bisexual. There's even more shades
00:11:32 You know what? This is this is four four distinct shades of purple instead of three
00:11:37 It's bisexual, but it it it specifically excludes the possibility of being like equally
00:11:45 Attracted to to men or women. It's like yeah
00:11:49 You can be you can be bi and you could be into one and the other, but you can't ever be perfectly
00:11:56 Perfectly in the middle. You always got to lean one side or another
00:11:58 I'm taking the stand and I'm fine with the L's and the B's and the G's and the T's
00:12:03 But the B's that are like I mean I'm kind of in the middle like nah those specifically those ones
00:12:08 I don't put their liars. They're just lying. They got to have a preference. That's what this flag means. I
00:12:14 sected more like by
00:12:16 Fercated by
00:12:18 No, um
00:12:19 The word I was looking for was defenestrated, but that's not that's not right. He forested
00:12:25 D-flowered
00:12:27 So what what's the yeah use the um, that's a big jump
00:12:33 Yeah, that was that was the day after the equestria daily feature
00:12:40 Uh, as you can see, so it actually had as you can see it got yeah, it actually did it got it got like um
00:12:47 Because it's not just on the website. It was also on the equestria daily
00:12:51 Instagram
00:12:53 And I saw the instagram got like a hundred or two hundred likes on the on the phantoms revenge post
00:13:00 That was pretty funny
00:13:02 But okay, what's interesting to me here is these colors, right?
00:13:07 Because there's four of these colors and these mean something um
00:13:11 They are these are these represent the sources that of the traffic
00:13:15 uh that
00:13:17 Okay, so
00:13:19 On the left see there's like the the purple on the top and then like a middle purple in the middle and then pink on the bottom
00:13:25 The the the top purple is on the far left not the not the blue we'll get to that later
00:13:30 On the left the purple is from twitter
00:13:34 And then the middle purple is from my website stcomics.com
00:13:38 And then the bottom pink is from itch.io
00:13:42 I think what that means is people just discovering it organically on the website scrolling. Yeah. Yeah, which is good
00:13:49 Like that's what I want the most of
00:13:52 Uh, because I think what that means is people who had never seen
00:13:57 You know my stuff before just finding it on the site like oh, what is this?
00:14:01 um
00:14:01 And then see yeah on the the day it gets the big spike that big up blue blue is from equestria daily.com
00:14:09 but you know encouragingly
00:14:12 uh the uh
00:14:14 Yeah, the pink bar the people discovering it on itch got got a boost too somehow. I don't know
00:14:20 um
00:14:21 Maybe that means people were going to the website and typing it in the search bar and finding it that way
00:14:28 It could be that or it could be like increased traffic
00:14:32 boosts the algorithm of itch and so it gets shown
00:14:35 It's like oh, this is a hot new thing. There's loads of people looking at it and then more people would find it via itch
00:14:40 I can't do anything
00:14:42 Yeah, maybe I I hope so and then uh that last day that's
00:14:47 Uh, that's today. So like, you know, it's still 10 a.m. So I'm hoping
00:14:52 I'm hoping that you know by the end of today it gets maybe it's has as many or maybe even more than uh yesterday
00:14:59 um, I don't know
00:15:01 but uh, yeah, so
00:15:04 You know people are are finding it through the website, which is good because you know, I would I hoped that the game would appeal not mere
00:15:13 I hoped that the game would appeal for its gameplay and for its puzzle elements to you know, just people that like
00:15:20 in video games, uh
00:15:22 and not necessarily just to people who uh
00:15:26 Have read the comic although, you know, obviously it's got the story in there that is directly tied into the comic and all that
00:15:33 Uh, so it's nice to see some people. Uh, just just find in it. That's very encouraging
00:15:40 Yeah, yeah
00:15:42 What else? What else? It's been good job. Nice game. Thanks. I'm proud of the game
00:15:48 I think it came out really good
00:15:50 uh, I want
00:15:52 more people to play it. I think I have
00:15:56 200 and something downloads now and I don't know like what
00:16:01 You know like in in terms of youtube numbers like that's terrible like 200 views of a video is like well
00:16:07 Get out of here. I don't know
00:16:10 like
00:16:12 That's gotta be better on itch. I don't know. That's probably I feel like that's probably a lot for just some game that someone posts on itch
00:16:20 I don't know if that's like if I should feel good about that number or bad about that number
00:16:25 Well, I don't have access to
00:16:28 uh pumpkin alley
00:16:31 like
00:16:32 Not not that i'm not that it's a contest or anything
00:16:36 No, no, no, no, I'm trying to see like if there's like a trend
00:16:40 What I have hippo not tries not to die from skeletons on
00:16:44 It's the analytics on that one. How do I find this?
00:16:47 Uh, if you go to your dashboard
00:16:50 Oh, shit, this doesn't go all the way back. No, it goes back to november 2021, but this was uploaded before that
00:16:56 It must be somewhere
00:16:58 Hmm
00:16:59 I so I um, yeah
00:17:01 I released a patch like two days or after release. I released a patch because there were some uh
00:17:08 There were a couple of little minor things that I had missed
00:17:11 and uh
00:17:12 I I had to I deleted the original file
00:17:16 And I uploaded a new file version 1.1
00:17:19 That's what you can download on the site now and I made a little development log
00:17:23 A patch notes page that explains like what all the changes are. It's all really minor stuff
00:17:28 um
00:17:29 But I but uh because it deleted the original file
00:17:33 It deleted the the record of like how many downloads that file had and I was like, oh, no
00:17:38 Now i'm gonna lose my analytics data
00:17:41 About you know, how many downloads the game has but no
00:17:45 It remembers how many downloads the page has had separately from how many downloads that particular file has had
00:17:53 So I did not lose that
00:17:55 Information so I know that it's 200 and
00:17:58 200 and like and 230 I think I pulled up. Um
00:18:02 Uh hippo tries not to die from skeletons when it came out
00:18:06 Or after I made a video about it. It got like 200 views. That was the spike
00:18:11 Mm-hmm, and then way later in like 2019 you got 50 views somehow. I don't know why
00:18:17 Was it like was it like uh, was it like
00:18:20 When oblivion fall made that uh made that uh
00:18:24 Uh the the cuphead animation, uh, I don't know could be
00:18:29 I feel like that was earlier, but it maybe is that then from that point, uh
00:18:35 Yeah, I don't I don't know. I haven't looked at the um dashboard analytic stuff that much
00:18:40 Phantom's revenge
00:18:42 To where I'm sitting at. Oh, no. Oh it passed 207 250
00:18:47 2174 views 277 downloads
00:18:53 It's not enough. It's not enough
00:18:55 When I hit a thousand downloads
00:18:57 When I hit a thousand downloads, uh
00:19:01 Where can I shill it?
00:19:03 Where can I shill it?
00:19:05 Harder
00:19:06 Maybe I should like email some
00:19:09 Could I email some gaming games journalists about it? Maybe I don't know
00:19:14 Uh, yeah, I don't know about that. I don't know how that works
00:19:17 I don't know. I you know, I tried I sent a couple emails about endless war to some like games journals once
00:19:24 Uh, it nothing ever happened
00:19:26 uh
00:19:30 I mean
00:19:31 I could try it again now that I have a game with graphics
00:19:35 These fucking hacks need their need the baby needs their bottle. I guess game journals need their graphics
00:19:43 On their video games
00:19:46 I guess
00:19:54 Anyway, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, two 250 241
00:19:59 Views of that game hippo tries not to die
00:20:02 30 28 downloads
00:20:04 On on the peak and then there's a bunch of other ones. How do I find like the just just just on like one day?
00:20:10 Yeah, that was the the the peak is the same like 200 something views
00:20:16 The 28 downloads of that shitty little like who cares thing
00:20:22 But you're talking that's that was the day like the day it got the most
00:20:25 Traffic is what you're saying. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah
00:20:29 Uh, um, hmm. Well, if you go to yeah, if you go to dashboard
00:20:35 Oh, wait, I'll download counts 548 people downloaded hippo tries not to die
00:20:41 Hmm. That's my target. That's my glass ceiling. I got a breakthrough
00:20:49 Uh
00:20:50 Yeah, it's an it's a new creator dashboard
00:20:53 Did I did I talk did I mention the ukraine bundle? I think I did last episode
00:20:58 I think yeah, we did
00:21:00 The the games on there are so fucking ridiculous
00:21:04 You get the you get minute you get Celeste
00:21:08 You get the kingdom 2
00:21:12 You get there's like there's like a bunch of like
00:21:15 Games like everybody should play
00:21:17 On there. Yeah
00:21:19 I when I noticed was super hot, which is when I wanted to play but I couldn't be bothered to pay for it
00:21:26 Hmm. Do you have do you have a vr rig?
00:21:31 Uh, my brother does
00:21:33 Oh, oh bob. Oh my god. Yeah, baba is you and a short hiker on there
00:21:39 Already had those but that is nice. I did already have a short hike. I did not have the baba is you
00:21:44 So I might I might play that actually I already had I actually already had
00:21:48 Celeste and minute and a short hike, but like
00:21:51 Any one of those games is worth the ten dollars for the bundle. So I got the baba is you so I might play the baba as you know
00:22:00 I think one of the baba is you I think one of the baba is you guys worked on noida
00:22:06 I feel like I remember that factoid somewhere. I
00:22:10 Can't don't quote me on that
00:22:12 um
00:22:14 Anyway, this week has felt really long because
00:22:18 The the day that I put the game out
00:22:20 Felt like it it felt like an entire week went by
00:22:23 It's like watching. I don't know just watching like the numbers go up and like hearing people like, you know
00:22:28 Responding to people on twitter being like, oh, I can't beat it games too hard
00:22:38 It's it seems like it seems like people can beat it in
00:22:43 The number of tries varies from like, you know, half a dozen to maybe like up to like 20
00:22:50 But it seems like it takes people around like four to six hours or so
00:22:55 Of you know, try and shit and figuring it out
00:22:59 To to to figure it out. Yeah, how long was my stream like three hours your stream was about three hours. Yeah
00:23:05 Yeah, it took me like
00:23:07 Maybe two hours after that off stream
00:23:09 Mm-hmm
00:23:11 Steel viper said it took them like four or five hours
00:23:15 That seems that seems to be about where it's settling
00:23:19 which is uh
00:23:21 I don't know that might be
00:23:23 Maybe it's long. Maybe it's long, but uh, whatever
00:23:28 I hope that um
00:23:30 I hope that uh, it's gratifying when when you when if people can stick with it
00:23:36 And you know have that realization. Uh-huh. I found out what I need
00:23:39 I figured I would need to do and then execute on it and get to the end
00:23:43 I hope people will be like
00:23:44 Yeah, it was worth it. It was it was worth my my energy
00:23:49 My precious my precious spirit energy my precious time on this earth was uh
00:23:54 spent well enough
00:23:57 uh
00:23:58 If unless you have anything else, I don't know. Do you is there anything else to say about that at the moment?
00:24:04 Um, I don't know. I mean I I liked it. I enjoyed uh the figuring out of stuff
00:24:09 Yeah, it's very polished and cool looking
00:24:12 Thank you
00:24:13 and the
00:24:15 the story
00:24:16 And the the face the face of I guess we can't I don't really want to spoil like exactly what happens
00:24:23 I know you everyone knows that it's his phantom's revenge and nightstar is involved
00:24:28 Nice. I mean nightstar is on the um her little her little gift and the thing is on is on the store page. So uh, yeah
00:24:36 Yeah, so there's no reason to like spoil what happens, but I really like that one face
00:24:40 That one face. Yeah, I yeah, that's good. It's a good face
00:24:44 uh the
00:24:46 I have been um, I have been retweeting people that uh
00:24:50 At me or hashtag phantom's revenge with the screenshots of their you know win
00:24:56 Uh, I have not
00:24:58 I won't I don't retweet ones that include the entire screen because the entire screen shows
00:25:04 Spoilers, so if you want me to retweet you just uh, just crop that out. Just show your stats. Oh, yeah the um
00:25:13 You know what I want to mention the
00:25:15 The patch I did here's here's what I did in the
00:25:19 The the v version 1.1 patch notes
00:25:22 Uh, oh, yeah, this is funny
00:25:25 Did you know that the the the damage that the son that the squirt gun soniches did it was just wrong
00:25:31 They simply did not do the amount of damage that it said they were doing
00:25:36 I yeah, I think I saw somebody talk about that somewhere
00:25:40 Uh, and I it was so I I had no idea that it was incorrect. I just assumed that what I was looking at
00:25:48 Was truth. It's uh, the insect was a lie. I don't think it would have made that much difference
00:25:54 Really in in terms of like
00:25:56 Although I do remember that on the stream at one point you said like
00:26:01 Oh, I it's it seems important that the squirt gun damage deals more damage than attacking
00:26:08 Costs slime and it turns out that that's not true. I mean, yeah, yeah the the okay
00:26:15 So what what happened was I I figured it out. Um
00:26:18 These squirt guns were meant to do 960 damage
00:26:22 And it calculates the damage they should do as 960, but then to actually deal the damage
00:26:30 It because you know when you're taking the damage your your slime number like
00:26:35 You know it it actively like rolls down, you know, it doesn't just change number
00:26:40 So it deals a fraction of that damage every frame the animation is playing
00:26:44 And it turns out that the animation was only 20 frames and I thought it was 25 frames
00:26:50 So it only dealt four fifths of the intended damage. So it dealt 768 instead of 960
00:26:57 Uh, but you know the game was all balanced around the amount of damage they were actually doing
00:27:03 So I just changed it to be 768 to preserve the balance. So now it's now at version 1.1
00:27:11 It actually says 768
00:27:13 It feels like a really strange way to
00:27:17 To calculate the damage something takes
00:27:19 You think so like for for every frame of animation like if you ever wanted to change an animation
00:27:25 Everything would be shifted
00:27:28 right
00:27:31 Um
00:27:35 Yes
00:27:37 Yes, if I if I changed the if I changed how long
00:27:43 Okay, well, here's what happens. Here's what happens the the sonichu squirts a bullet, right?
00:27:50 It creates a bullet object the bullet object moves to
00:27:54 Uh, the player or the the the hero being targeted
00:27:58 Uh, then when it reaches their location
00:28:01 The bullet destroys itself and creates a new object
00:28:06 That is called hit splash and it's a little has a little like splash like to show like water splashing off of them
00:28:12 and then that hit splash animation depending on whether the bullet was shot by a
00:28:17 Uh, a squirt gun sonichu or a super soaker sonichu
00:28:21 It it has a lifetime value that is set to either
00:28:25 A long value or a short value and then it counts down that value until zero and then it destroys itself
00:28:32 And so that lifetime value determines how many frames
00:28:36 the object lasts
00:28:39 And so for the super sonichu it only the lifetime value it was set at at 20
00:28:44 And so it it exists for 20 frames
00:28:47 And then it dies. So yeah, if I were to change how long that
00:28:52 Uh lasted it would change the amount of damage that was that was being dealt
00:28:57 uh
00:28:59 actually the the number is like
00:29:01 The number of damage is actually based on
00:29:05 Phantoms starting slime level. So if I changed phantom starting slime level all the sonichus and all of both types
00:29:12 Would suddenly deal a different amount of damage because they calculate a value based on his starting level
00:29:18 And then they take that number and then they do the thing of like, okay
00:29:22 They divide it about by the number of frames and then they do a fraction of it every frame
00:29:26 That's I mean, that's how I achieved the uh the effect of like his his uh,
00:29:31 You know his slime count like, you know rolling down as he takes damage
00:29:37 I probably there probably was a another way to do it
00:29:41 It seems overly complicated and relies on like multiple different things aligning perfectly
00:29:47 Uh, it might it might be
00:29:50 To tell you the truth. There's another thing
00:29:53 I mean, there's probably a lot of things like that. Um
00:29:55 The screen shake like when
00:29:59 Okay, like when phantom takes damage, there's a screen shake effect
00:30:03 uh
00:30:05 Let me tell you what doesn't happen in that in when the screen shakes the game does not
00:30:11 render an image of itself
00:30:14 And then shake the image what actually happens is
00:30:18 uh
00:30:21 Is that the game goes through a list of every object that exists in the game
00:30:27 Selects those objects that I decided these things shake during the screen shake effect
00:30:33 And then takes those actual objects and moves them
00:30:37 around according to
00:30:39 a continually varying
00:30:41 Uh variable well first it records their initial position
00:30:45 And then it takes it creates a shake object that randomly
00:30:50 Varies through a shake variable and then it takes every object that is considered shakeable
00:30:56 And then it shakes them around and moves them around their starting position
00:31:01 And then it like ends and then it returns them to their starting location
00:31:06 And then it destroys itself and then the shake is over
00:31:09 uh, so
00:31:11 Very stupid and inefficient and bad way to do that
00:31:14 Uh, but that's what I do
00:31:18 I mean, it's funny because like you play the game and it just it nothing feels wrong
00:31:23 It's just sort of like yeah, it's a screen shaker. It's this is a jumping thing. It doesn't feel wrong
00:31:27 But under under the hood it's totally wrong and it's totally fucked up and bizarre and like
00:31:34 you know
00:31:35 Somebody I for I forget who it was
00:31:38 Someone on the endless war dev team at some point
00:31:41 Like someone was looking at the the endless war code and someone DMed me to be like ben
00:31:47 I'm looking at the code you wrote for endless war
00:31:51 And it is so bad
00:31:54 To the point that I am convinced that it has memetic qualities
00:31:58 Like that's what they that's what they say
00:32:02 What were they referring to I don't exactly know
00:32:05 They I they just thought that my code was so bad and so like counterintuitive that it was like
00:32:12 A joke it was like I'd written it as a joke
00:32:17 That's what they said anyway, I don't know there. I'm sure they I'm sure it wasn't that I'm sure it was fine
00:32:23 um
00:32:24 the
00:32:25 But it doesn't matter if the the end result is good
00:32:27 It just depends on how long how much extra time you may have taken to make something happen
00:32:34 Yeah with a convoluted way like that. Yeah, uh
00:32:39 Yeah, there's probably a bunch of stuff in there that I did the hard way because I just didn't know there was an easy way to do it
00:32:45 Uh, but you know that's learning
00:32:48 Uh folks
00:32:50 I mean
00:32:52 That's video games and you know and you know what like what's like what's the alternative?
00:32:57 Like that I feel like maybe there's some people that might hear that and be frustrated like ah ben
00:33:02 Like why didn't you just like learn game design first? Like why didn't you like study?
00:33:07 I don't know computer science first or something and I'm like well
00:33:12 That would it take like
00:33:14 Yeah, it made the game take longer that I didn't know
00:33:18 The right way to do these things
00:33:20 But how much longer than that would it have taken for me to like become educated beforehand?
00:33:26 Before I could have I would have even started
00:33:29 Making the game. You know what I mean?
00:33:31 Actually, it's funny. I actually feel like
00:33:34 You're
00:33:35 You're like higher education your physics degree and your your knowledge of mathematics you already have
00:33:42 Probably made you think of these more convoluted ways of doing it than if you were like a real dumb dumb
00:33:47 Hmm
00:33:50 What do you mean your brain is so a bit like like my brain's so big that I it's like that episode of
00:33:55 Mordecai and rigby regular show where they become so smart that the nobody can understand them anymore
00:34:01 That's like my code
00:34:04 It's like if I were trying to do something I'd be like, um, I don't know one plus one
00:34:10 How do I figure this out? And I would look at tutorials and being like all this
00:34:13 I wouldn't think to do it so convolutedly
00:34:16 Well, I wouldn't even know how to think about that. You know, you know what?
00:34:21 Something like screen shake. I probably could have just googled like
00:34:26 screen shake effect in game maker and just seen how people
00:34:29 How other people figure theirs out because like there are there are there are there are things in game maker that I don't even understand like
00:34:38 apparently like the game
00:34:40 it renders
00:34:42 all these sprites
00:34:44 onto a
00:34:45 Quote unquote screen, right? There is a thing in the game called a screen
00:34:50 Which you you can basically just quote unquote shake, right?
00:34:55 So I probably could have just googled it and I would have found that out and it probably would have made my life easier
00:34:59 I just didn't think
00:35:01 I just thought like okay the game is the game is drawing these pixels
00:35:06 I have to make the pixels move
00:35:08 somehow well
00:35:10 The the the the sprites are tied to objects. Well, I guess I got to make the objects move or I got to make the objects draw their sprites
00:35:19 Just just the most the most intuitive way that I thought to do it was well
00:35:23 I got to make the objects move
00:35:25 I got to make the objects move to make the screen shake
00:35:28 Turns out game maker kind of has a built-in thing that sort of means that you don't have to do that
00:35:33 I I guess I was like
00:35:37 I did oh, I I did use a tutorial like the first thing that I did the first the very first thing that I did when I started making the game
00:35:44 was I looked up tutorials for how to build a like a
00:35:48 jrpg battle menu
00:35:51 and I followed tutorials from
00:35:53 A guy I think he was called game maker rob was the youtube channel
00:35:58 He had just a tutorial series about it
00:36:01 And I just walked through with him making a thing
00:36:05 It took me like three days. I think of following his tutorials to get a menu going
00:36:10 Which seems like I remember at the time being like oh, this has taken me so long. I just want to be done with it
00:36:16 Now in hindsight, it's like wow three days
00:36:19 Little that I know this shit would take me like 13 months
00:36:23 Uh
00:36:24 Oh, well, uh, but um
00:36:28 Yeah, so I I followed that tutorial and uh, it was kind of annoying
00:36:32 And he you know, he was building like a rpg magic menu. So it has stuff in there
00:36:38 He's got magic. There's a magic option
00:36:41 There's spells. They don't do anything but there is like
00:36:44 So yeah, so in the phantom's revenge code there is like, you know
00:36:49 No, uh annotated out code for like
00:36:52 A man a magic option in the uh, you know in the battle menu and whatever
00:36:58 Uh, that was like the foundation that I built everything else on and then every time I wanted to add a new command
00:37:03 I'd be like, okay. Well, let's take a command that I already have
00:37:07 Like duplicate it and then like whichever one is closest to what I'm envisioning duplicate it and then just you know
00:37:14 Make make such changes as are required to turn it into the new command that I wanted to be
00:37:20 um
00:37:21 yeah
00:37:23 I
00:37:25 I don't know I
00:37:28 I'm I'm I'm actually like
00:37:30 I know I know that it was not
00:37:33 I know that I didn't do everything in the most efficient way possible
00:37:37 But how was I but like how am I supposed to know?
00:37:40 What what am I supposed to do about the fact that I don't know?
00:37:44 What am I supposed to do about the fact that I don't know the optimal way to do everything because right?
00:37:48 If I wanted if I wanted to be like, oh, well, let me first. I'll learn everything about game design
00:37:53 I'll learn everything about programming before I start making my game and then I'll know the optimal way to do everything
00:37:59 And then I'll you know, and then I'll do everything as efficiently as possible. Well, sure
00:38:06 But then I'll how I'll never I'll never start making the game, right?
00:38:09 I'll just you'll get caught in that thing with like, oh, I'm I'm not ready. I'm not ready to work on this thing
00:38:15 I have to um that that is true. That is a potential trap. I have to prepare for it. I have to like no
00:38:20 I'm not ready. I have to I have to study more before I can start it. I'm not good enough
00:38:25 you know
00:38:27 I'm never worried about not being good enough
00:38:29 Um, because I'll never be good enough. So whatever
00:38:34 Yeah, that's that's the best way you could ever look at anything
00:38:38 It is I'll never be good enough. I'll never be good. I'll never be good enough. So you to fuck it
00:38:43 I know that I'll it'll suck whenever I end up doing it. So might as well suck now
00:38:51 Why wait suck now die later
00:38:54 true
00:38:56 uh speaking of sucking and dying and video games
00:39:00 Uh, I've been playing Hades this week after after the game came out
00:39:05 I was like, I want to play a video game
00:39:08 I I started playing Hades famously the reason I started playing Noita was because
00:39:14 Someone recommended me and my old roommate Lorenz recommended me Hades
00:39:19 And I went to download it and then as it was downloading I saw steam recommending me Noida
00:39:25 And I went and I looked at the demo for that or the the the trailer and I was like, what the fuck is this?
00:39:30 And I downloaded Noida and then I played that for a year and then I never played Hades Lamal
00:39:35 Well, but I'm playing Hades now and it's really good
00:39:38 It's really fucking good. Do you?
00:39:41 Do you know about it? I I do know about it. It's the company that made um
00:39:47 bastion
00:39:48 Yes, and uh and and transistor
00:39:52 Yeah, they they have that
00:39:54 distinct
00:39:55 Isometric sort of style. Yeah camera angle thing
00:39:59 I submit isometric camera angle and uh like strummy like folk guitar
00:40:08 I don't know what you'd call it
00:40:14 Like a sort of like uh, I don't know what you would call that style of guitar, but there's a very specific
00:40:22 It maybe I don't know. Um, but there's a very
00:40:26 particular sort of strummy guitar soundtrack they have and sometimes
00:40:30 Sometimes that soundtrack the Hades sounds like that and I'm like, oh, yeah, this is a super giant game
00:40:36 I didn't play bastion and I didn't play transistor
00:40:39 and I also didn't play um
00:40:41 Do you know about their weird like fantasy basketball game?
00:40:46 No, uh, it's not it's um, hold on, uh, you play basketball in an isometric perspective
00:40:53 It's not actually basketball. It's a
00:40:57 But it's like a it's like a sort of it's like a fantasy sport game
00:41:01 That is sort of like basketball because it involves moving a ball to a goal
00:41:07 um
00:41:08 That's all sports. Yeah, pretty much, uh, pie. It's called pyre
00:41:14 It's a it's about um
00:41:16 I watched a video about super giant games one time and that guy said that like he pyre was his favorite
00:41:22 It's it was not successful
00:41:24 Uh, it's like their worst performing game ever
00:41:28 Uh, because a lot of people didn't get it, but this guy really liked it
00:41:32 because it's like, um
00:41:34 It's not like in universe. It's about like a band of nomads that have been exiled from some
00:41:41 country, but like they're part of this like weird spiritual, uh culture and they have to do these like
00:41:49 Rituals and like the the the the game it's not the game is like the ritual. They're doing this like
00:41:55 Ritual, but it's like a competitive ritual to see like who can I don't know
00:42:00 Make the sacrifice first or whatever
00:42:03 I don't it's very weird
00:42:05 Yeah, pyre is their other game people don't know that one as much people don't talk about it as much as bastion and transistor
00:42:12 Uh, but anyway
00:42:13 Yeah, I haven't played any of those games
00:42:16 I uh, I haven't played them in either. There's something about the
00:42:19 camera angle that that perspective that I I
00:42:23 I don't like for some reason
00:42:25 Yeah, I know I I kind of know what you mean. There's something about it
00:42:30 I don't I don't know. Yeah, like it's it's objectively a good way to
00:42:35 Depict what they're doing for for the gameplay
00:42:38 You can see a lot of the the the place and you can dodge around if it was in first person
00:42:43 It would be maybe disorienting if it was side-scrolling then there wouldn't be a lot of depth
00:42:49 And uh, if it was completely top-down, I mean, it would be the same I guess
00:42:54 That's just something about it. There's just like unappealing visually not like because of art style
00:43:00 It's just that that view. I don't like it. I get it. It reminds me of like shitty gba games
00:43:06 For some reason that I didn't enjoy like like there was this fucking spiral game that was on Game Boy Advance
00:43:10 Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know what you're talking about like season of ice and fire or something
00:43:15 It feels yeah, it felt it felt cheap a little bit
00:43:19 Honestly, yeah, like that. I know the exactly the spire you're talking about. I've played it. It was like a cheap knockoff
00:43:25 I feel yeah
00:43:27 It's not fair, but yeah, I also feel like something about that it kind of looks cheap
00:43:32 Like I never I was not impressed by what I saw of bastion
00:43:36 And transistor. I mean they looked fine
00:43:38 I'm like I got it, but I was not enticed to play them
00:43:42 but people told me that Hades is uh, like a
00:43:45 You know a rogue a rogue light
00:43:48 With like really like fun combat deez nuts. Hey, hey deez nuts. And so
00:43:56 Yeah, I was like, okay, that sounds like my kind of game. So I gave it a try and yep. It's my kind of game
00:44:01 Uh, it's I really appreciate
00:44:04 Do you know the story?
00:44:06 I really appreciate it. I I assume from what I've seen that it's Hades son
00:44:12 And he's like, I don't go fuck and Hades like um, you do have to go fuck and then he fights all the gods
00:44:18 Some something like that. Uh, you don't fight the gods the gods are the gods give you boons because they want to help you escape
00:44:25 Uh, but it's really good because um the conceit of the game
00:44:31 This is this is what we call ludo narrative. Uh, whatever the opposite
00:44:35 I've had the same thing the other day. I couldn't think of ludo narrative assonance
00:44:41 Synergy, whatever. Yeah, uh
00:44:43 When you uh, because the story of the game
00:44:47 The story of the protagonist and the story of the player are the same
00:44:50 Because you know, he too he keeps going out and trying to escape and dying and getting reborn in the pool of sticks or whatever
00:44:58 And he's got to try again
00:45:00 He you know for him it's a pardon the expression, you know
00:45:03 This sycophie and task of you know, just going and trying over and over and over again
00:45:07 And for you and that's what you the player are doing as well
00:45:10 You're trying over and over and over again making it a little bit further each time
00:45:14 Uh, very good. Very good. Uh, they really were like
00:45:18 Hey, why don't we make the why don't we make the story fit the gameplay and then they did
00:45:24 Uh, I really appreciate that
00:45:26 The best ludo narrative synergy is when you die in the game you die for real
00:45:32 You you can either yeah, there's you could either make it so that you know, the character never really dies
00:45:38 He just gets reborn over and over, you know, that's one way but that's for cowards. Yeah, the better way is
00:45:45 You die in the game
00:45:47 The game the game shoots you with a VR headset with a gun attached and when you die the gun goes off
00:45:55 Uh
00:45:56 Really heightens the uh
00:45:58 It heightens the drama
00:46:01 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm
00:46:03 That would be a black mirror episode of some sort of cheesy like
00:46:08 Post like future scary future scary story where it's like
00:46:12 Everyone was playing vr, but they didn't know there was a fucking little bomb inside and if they died in the game
00:46:18 The bomb would go off in the future and they couldn't take that vr helmet off for no reason
00:46:22 Can you believe that in the degenerate future? You know
00:46:26 Humanity has humanity has regressed so much. We're so we're so like dopamine star that like people are even
00:46:33 People are playing vr games
00:46:36 They they can't even get off on regular vr games anymore
00:46:39 Now they have to play vr games with a little bomb in the headset
00:46:42 That will go off and make them die if they lose. It's the only way they can feel anything anymore
00:46:48 Uh, it's the future
00:46:50 I mean it sure that'll be invented by some crazy person and then they'll stream it and everyone will be saying no
00:46:58 I mean at that it's like, you know, I mean people die doing uh
00:47:02 Doing uh, what do you call it? Uh, auto erotic?
00:47:06 Auto auto erotic asphyxiation
00:47:09 Uh, so, you know, that's like, oh, you know the little the danger is what makes it is what makes it good. So
00:47:15 Uh, same, you know say but for but for gameplay instead of orgasms
00:47:21 uh
00:47:23 Good good video game
00:47:26 Uh, I think I I I I my first my first win my first win was with the rail
00:47:33 Uh, the the rail gun that's uh, that's how I got my first
00:47:36 win although
00:47:38 The story the story continues even after you quote-unquote win like
00:47:43 Just uh winning is not enough. You have to you have to do more beyond that. So I'm still
00:47:50 I've been playing it for like three or four days now. Uh, it's really good
00:47:54 Uh, that's like other than watching my analytics. That's like all I've been doing
00:47:59 Uh, I deserve it. I deserve a break
00:48:04 Yes, yeah video game I video games are good for you actually
00:48:10 Uh, I was gonna say this this segue earlier when you're talking about a patch, but the there will be
00:48:17 Uh, I'm not sure when but definitely like within the next few days as of recording a patch for pumpkin alley
00:48:25 Oh
00:48:26 Did you already do a patch that like changed the uh the falling thing?
00:48:31 No, no, we that was the patch I was talking about we were making and um,
00:48:35 It's not out yet because we there was a there was a complication with some people on some computers
00:48:41 max
00:48:42 Couldn't open the photo album from the menu and some people in different countries had like
00:48:48 Uh, the the the tutorial signs like not work with the text
00:48:53 It's there's a there's a bit of like
00:48:56 Fixing of a very specific little bugs
00:48:59 Um, but we it's very close to being
00:49:03 Done, uh, there's also
00:49:06 A new lizard
00:49:08 In this new no fucking way
00:49:10 There's a new lizard. Oh, and um
00:49:13 There's a bunch of changes to like the speed of characters and a bit of jumping tweaks and
00:49:18 It's a lot of little things. So it's not like it's not gonna be like
00:49:23 We're not gonna continue making patches over and over again
00:49:26 This is just gonna be this one time because there was a bunch of like kind of important bugs
00:49:31 And we thought we may as well like tidy up some stuff
00:49:35 While we were doing it and then this is this is the this is the pumpkin patch. We're calling it
00:49:41 Huh, and then that's great
00:49:43 and then later
00:49:45 We'll be the next patch will be the
00:49:47 Fucking finished game or however we we want to to do that
00:49:51 We might have an alpha for like kickstarter back as if we make a a
00:49:56 A kickstarter for to to fund it
00:49:58 You mean we're looking into that at the moment, but yeah the alpha
00:50:03 Uh, what are you gonna do for the for the alpha version?
00:50:08 What do you mean?
00:50:09 You you said you're gonna do a patch and then you're gonna do one more update and that's gonna be the alpha version
00:50:14 No, the no no no the the patch. This is just for the demo. We're talking about the hotfix for the demo
00:50:20 Yeah, and then when we make the full game
00:50:23 Oh, right
00:50:24 That's the next time you'll see any of new stuff. Okay. Okay. Okay. Um, yeah, it makes sense
00:50:33 Uh, so
00:50:35 So if you have played the demo already, there is reason for you to play the new one because of the new lizard
00:50:41 Uh, yeah, I wanted to yeah, I watched I watched keyblade spirit
00:50:46 stream the
00:50:49 Herself playing the demo and she found lizards that I had not even heard of before
00:50:56 I didn't know about the white lizard. That's exciting
00:51:00 Yeah, so I still have not found
00:51:03 The red one and the white one and I think maybe one other one or maybe it was just those two
00:51:10 And then I guess there's another one now that I'll have to hunt down
00:51:14 Uh
00:51:16 Pretty pretty cool. I like those
00:51:18 I call them surprise lizards because they make the little they make what sounds to me like the little alert noise from
00:51:26 Metal gear solid
00:51:29 There's something like that
00:51:32 Oh
00:51:33 I was gonna mention, uh, yeah for the the phantom's revenge patch the patch notes. Here's here's what I did
00:51:40 Uh
00:51:41 Yeah, so the squirt gun damage, uh, I didn't change the damage that they actually dealt. I just changed the number
00:51:47 Well, well, I fixed the code so that
00:51:50 It's it it intentionally deals the 768 and then I changed the number. So it actually says like, okay, this is how much it actually deals
00:51:58 um, there was a mistake in the
00:52:03 Virginia's sprite not in her normal sprite, but when she was sad in the chambers where she's sad
00:52:09 Uh, her tail had like a visual error in it where like
00:52:13 The impression of her like wings sort of like was taking like a chunk out of her tail
00:52:18 It was kind of hard to see but if you watched it, you could you could see it. It looked a little yeah, I mentioned that
00:52:22 Yeah, that's right. You did. Um, yeah. Yeah, I forgot it was you
00:52:27 Uh, uh, so I fixed that that's fixed. Um, I I made it so that the end screen displays
00:52:35 the end screen used to display your, uh
00:52:40 What was it your your time to beat your slime coin your
00:52:46 Uh, your virginia's status your horn status
00:52:49 Uh, probably maybe one I forget. Anyway added it now displays your final level and your final, uh, weapon skill or your weapon mastery level
00:52:59 because um
00:53:01 You know, it's there's since there's different routes, right since you can take a leveling route or uh
00:53:07 Or an anointing route. I thought it would be good to show like, okay. What's your final level?
00:53:11 What's your final
00:53:12 Anoint status so you can be like, oh, that's how you want. Okay, because those are those are relevant. Those are worth
00:53:19 knowing about
00:53:20 Um, and then oh, I changed it. You said this as well
00:53:24 You thought it was a mistake that uh, the final boss when you when you exclamation point data on the final boss
00:53:30 It shows her max hp, but it doesn't show
00:53:34 Her it doesn't update when you damage her. Yeah, that was not a mistake. I was just lazy
00:53:40 Uh, but I fixed that so now now it displays
00:53:44 Her her current hp as a fraction of her
00:53:47 Total hp so it says like, you know 2000 20 000 out of you know, 3000 32
00:53:53 1500
00:53:55 um
00:53:56 The inner lad spoilers that number
00:53:59 Uh, don't worry about it
00:54:02 Uh the um
00:54:05 The inner lab music before I had forgotten to fix the inner lab music to loop
00:54:10 So if you if you played it long enough
00:54:13 The inner this is when you get past the the spoiler battle
00:54:17 Uh, and you get into the inner area
00:54:20 Before it just it would fade out and then start again. I changed it so that it loops now
00:54:25 Uh
00:54:26 And then I added to to the to the marriage animation
00:54:29 I added a little thing where the word skill up pops up twice
00:54:35 Uh, when phantom when phantom kisses uh platinum
00:54:40 His little heart comes little green heart comes out and then it goes bling and then it turns into a little double skill up
00:54:45 Because I thought oh, yeah
00:54:46 Because I thought there was a pretty significant chance that people wouldn't realize that marriage actually increases your weapon skill
00:54:52 So I added that to be just to make it crystal clear like this this is increasing your weapon skill
00:54:56 I thought it was it was just like a funny like cutscene. No, no, it's uh, it's it
00:55:03 It's too it. Well, yeah in endless war getting married
00:55:07 Uh boosts your weapon skill by two but means that you can't switch your weapon at will
00:55:12 Uh, so I mean phantom only has the one weapon so he doesn't need to switch
00:55:16 But uh, yeah, it it boosts your weapon skill. You can I think you can anoint
00:55:21 I think you can anoint
00:55:23 Four times before it stops increase you can keep anointing
00:55:28 But it just doesn't increase your weapon skill any further after a while
00:55:32 And then I think beyond you can then you can marry and I think that will boost your
00:55:39 That will boost your skill
00:55:41 Too higher than that
00:55:44 You can if you anoint twice
00:55:46 You can that's when you can get married
00:55:50 And then you could if you wanted to anoint up to four times before it stops being helpful
00:55:56 And then at whatever point you get married
00:55:59 Boost your weapon skill to above whatever you were at when you marry. So you could
00:56:05 Get as high as low as weapon mastery eight if you anoint four times
00:56:09 And then marry I think I think
00:56:13 Does that increase the slime it takes to attack or is that just your level? No, uh weapon mastery
00:56:19 Does not increase the cost to attack only leveling increases the cost to attack
00:56:26 The that's that's and that's that's the truth
00:56:29 Uh, so it doesn't it doesn't really matter whether you
00:56:33 Leveling it matters when you do it anointing it does not and marriage it does not matter when you do it
00:56:38 It doesn't it doesn't cost you more to do it earlier
00:56:41 Uh, and then oh, yeah, the last thing was I had a patron a patron's name was just in there twice for some reason
00:56:47 So I just took that out. So now it's only in there once
00:56:50 And those are all the patch notes
00:56:52 It took me like it just took me like a couple hours to do all these things was really easy
00:56:57 Uh, but now the game is perfect
00:57:00 Damn
00:57:04 Oh, oh, oh wait one more thing one more thing I have to say about this is it was really funny
00:57:11 So the way that you finish the comic is by beating the game
00:57:14 And then when you beat the game you get the link to the end of the comic, right?
00:57:18 Yes, well, I made two different versions of the ending where
00:57:25 Uh one where phantom has his horn and the other where he does not
00:57:31 Uh, you know, because I was like, well, what if you if you beat the game with your horn, you know
00:57:34 You want to you would want phantom to have his horn in the final scene? Yeah. Yeah
00:57:37 Well, it turns out you can never get the horn ending. It is impossible to finish the game
00:57:44 And get the the link to the horned version
00:57:47 Really? Yes, because I I didn't
00:57:52 the the
00:57:53 If you if you play the game optimally
00:57:56 You can you can keep virginia from taking a hit
00:58:00 uh, if you
00:58:04 You you can't you can't prevent phantom from
00:58:09 Well, no, you you can't prevent phantom from
00:58:13 Taking from losing his from losing his horn in the same way. I'm not gonna say I won't spoil why but the point is it doesn't work
00:58:19 Uh, uh, you you you can okay. You can win with the horn, but you
00:58:27 You get the bad ending so you don't get the oh, yeah, so you don't get the link
00:58:32 So yeah, you the only way to win
00:58:35 Uh with the horn means that the game doesn't let you doesn't give you the link to the final page
00:58:40 So that no one will ever see yeah
00:58:43 It's there. I guess you you would have to um
00:58:47 You have to heck the game you would have to well you would have to guess the url
00:58:50 You would if you got the the actual ending you could maybe try like changing the url
00:58:54 And maybe you could find the horn version if you really wanted to does that mean one of them is like more canon than the other
00:59:01 In my I already considered the horn the hornless version to be more canon
00:59:06 Because I was like well, I mean nobody's gonna
00:59:08 I I had I had forgotten I had actually forgotten
00:59:12 Uh, I had I was thinking for a minute that if you played it perfectly you ended with your horn intact and
00:59:19 Virginia unharmed that is that is wrong. You you can't do that
00:59:24 But you don't you just don't have enough slime
00:59:26 uh
00:59:27 So I was thinking
00:59:29 Yeah, you can do it, but like no one's gonna do it on their first
00:59:32 Playthrough and it makes more
00:59:35 You know and you know people are gonna lose their horn on their first win
00:59:38 You know of course and honestly it makes a little bit it's a little bit more thematic if like you know if phantom has taken
00:59:43 damage by the end of his
00:59:46 quest for for revenge
00:59:48 It's also like a cool cutscene like if this was part of the comic
00:59:52 Yeah, that would happen that would just be like a cool thing to happen
00:59:55 Yeah, so even even so the the hornless ending was more canon in my head
01:00:01 Although I thought if you get the hornless version that's canon too. You deserve it
01:00:05 Uh, but turns out no
01:00:07 It's not because it's impossible
01:00:10 I just uh, it's a different timeline thought that was thought that was pretty funny
01:00:15 uh, you can um
01:00:17 The bad the the actual bad ending though is not canon as endless war will let you know if you try to continue on
01:00:24 after getting it
01:00:27 Someone in my patron discord was like
01:00:31 Oh, the link's not working the link's not working and I
01:00:34 Smugly I was like, hey, you know what you did you deserve this
01:00:40 But it turned out no just like their their internet browser was just like not responding
01:00:46 So I was like, oh no
01:00:49 Oops, you know what you did. You know you didn't get uh google fiber. You didn't you didn't update chrome
01:00:55 new monster
01:00:57 Yeah
01:00:58 uh
01:00:59 LeMau
01:01:01 Whoo, so yeah, it's the the weakest felt really long
01:01:05 Uh, yeah, it hasn't it felt like a long time ago that the game came out
01:01:10 Your game came out it really did
01:01:13 Like I I released it that day and then like by the time it was like the end of the day
01:01:18 I was going to bed. I was like, it's only been one day
01:01:21 The game's only been out for one day. It felt like an entire week had gone by
01:01:24 was it uh, was it
01:01:26 Was it lenin that said uh, there are
01:01:30 There are decades where nothing happens and there are weeks where decades happen or something like that or stallin
01:01:37 one of those guys
01:01:39 One of my heroes
01:01:42 It sounds like yeah, this sort of thing. Yeah that a smart person would say
01:01:48 True
01:01:49 So a capitalist would never have said that they would never have figured that out dogs
01:01:56 um
01:01:58 Yeah, I guess uh, that's that's uh
01:02:02 That's what's been going on with phantoms or revenge
01:02:05 I'm glad the game's done, but now I don't know what to do with myself. So I've just been playing hades
01:02:13 and that's well
01:02:15 I mean, you did say you were gonna like work on biscuit page is the next thing. Oh, sure. Yeah
01:02:21 There's always like a list of of like projects to get round to it's just that
01:02:27 You've spent so long
01:02:30 Building up momentum and like
01:02:33 For this one project now that you've stopped you take a break and then it's like
01:02:38 Um, well now I've got to do another thing. Oh, no, you're you're at a standstill
01:02:42 You've got to like build up the momentum momentum again for a different thing
01:02:46 Actually, I lied what I have I have spent some time
01:02:51 Doing stuff related to the book
01:02:53 Uh, like I've been all right
01:02:55 I've been I've been in touch with printers like getting quotes from different printers and like finding out like who's gonna give me the best price
01:03:01 Uh, and I've been like setting up, uh, you know
01:03:05 The the image files that I will eventually use for the uh
01:03:09 it turns like a
01:03:11 I kind of put that aside for a bit because I need to deter I need to determine which printer I'm going with
01:03:18 First so that I know what dimensions to use and then I can do the like, you know
01:03:24 Set up set up the pages to be the correct, uh
01:03:28 Uh, yeah dimensions and whatever I it's looking like mix-im is going to be the the cheapest option
01:03:36 Cheap cheapest and has like the most um the most uh like options. I think
01:03:42 I just wish they'd send me the goddamn sample pack
01:03:45 I just still haven't they won't no they won't do it. Uh, oh, oh they said um
01:03:50 Um
01:03:51 Yeah, they did I did I tell you this already? They said uh
01:03:54 They initially told me that they wouldn't do it because there was a software issue
01:03:58 Like their website was just like not working and I asked them like
01:04:03 Well, can you just send it to me?
01:04:05 And they replied and basically they were just like no
01:04:11 I just won't they were they were like, uh, hold on. What did they say? They said something stupid
01:04:17 Um, we hate people from Boston
01:04:21 Okay, they they said unfortunately due to the global paper shortage
01:04:25 We are not offering sample packs at this time to anyone. So I guess they just aren't doing sample packs at all
01:04:31 Oh
01:04:32 So that's unfortunate. It is unfortunate and it makes me wonder like wait
01:04:36 Am I like getting am I getting like a bad price to print right now like is printing right now bad
01:04:42 Because paper shortage
01:04:45 I don't I haven't heard of a paper shortage. I would imagine something something covet would have done something somewhere
01:04:51 I don't I don't know maybe
01:04:54 That that's what they said unfortunately due to the global paper shortage
01:04:58 um
01:05:00 Maybe I mean it's just it's just like
01:05:03 I just need to know like I would like to see like the difference between like 80 pound paper and 100 pound paper
01:05:08 I could probably get that somewhere else
01:05:10 If I'm not the only people that could give me something like that
01:05:14 um
01:05:15 But anyway mixem seems to offer the
01:05:18 I'll probably have to just bite the bullet and spend like 60 dollars or 70 dollars ordering like a test copy
01:05:25 Yeah
01:05:28 Uh, but I don't they seem to be I
01:05:31 I contacted another local printer in boston. This one was called alpha graphics and they too
01:05:37 They were quoting me like like 30 or like 25 30 dollars a copy
01:05:41 Like what is like what is the point of view?
01:05:44 What what are you doing?
01:05:46 I don't know. I I don't know if it's their fault. Maybe it's the global paper shortage or whatever
01:05:52 But it's just it's just an unacceptable price point like I'm aghast like I'm aghast that they would show me that
01:05:58 And like not be shamed of themselves. I don't know. Oh, I'm looking it up
01:06:04 Paper prices have gone up a little more than 25 percent since january 2021
01:06:09 and
01:06:12 And because and because they're up 25 they can't offer sample packs anymore
01:06:16 25 well, there's
01:06:18 I mean there's more to it like they say the paper mills reduce their workforce during the turmoil of 2020
01:06:25 Many mills transitioned into making boxes for example for amazon versus making paper for direct mail pieces
01:06:33 I guess since paper
01:06:36 They have the power to make boxes and there's more demand for those. I don't know
01:06:40 Okay types and paper grades would discontinued. They don't elaborate on why
01:06:45 Okay, there's probably lots to learn about that. That's weird. But are but are you telling me?
01:06:51 right, but are you telling me
01:06:53 that
01:06:55 No, they can't no due to the paper shortage. They can't send a paper sample pack
01:06:59 But they can
01:07:01 just
01:07:02 print
01:07:03 A thousand copies of my book if I want them to
01:07:08 Well, yeah, because you're paying for it
01:07:14 Okay, but
01:07:15 Okay, but 25 isn't that much and I need and I want the fucking sample
01:07:20 I don't know man. I just
01:07:24 Seems stupid. They say they say 25 since january 2021. It probably has gone up
01:07:30 Uh like since 2020
01:07:35 I'm just looking at a blog about it
01:07:38 I uh, maybe
01:07:43 I just
01:07:45 Well, and that makes me nervous because like gosh like what if I'm
01:07:49 What if I'm paying like what if it's going to be like too costly to get my book made now? What if
01:07:54 I don't know. I mean I I would have been caught in like the heightened paper thing as well
01:08:02 It was still it was I mean it was still like within what I thought it would be
01:08:07 Yeah, although I did I did like order. I did look into it start looking into it in the middle of 2020
01:08:13 I think what if when the hell did I do the lord ghosts?
01:08:18 I don't uh
01:08:21 The paper was already expensive I guess is the point
01:08:25 The I wonder I mean that makes me nervous like geez like
01:08:30 If I wait till next year to do the book will that like
01:08:35 Increase will that like lower the costs?
01:08:38 I don't I don't want to wait until next year
01:08:41 But like I don't know
01:08:43 If if it would make the production cost like 50 lower or something I might consider it
01:08:47 But it probably I mean it probably wouldn't be that dramatic a difference, but like
01:08:53 It would be really sad if like just across the board like paper becomes more expensive because so much is
01:09:01 digitized
01:09:02 That you don't need paper so much and then like making comics is way more difficult
01:09:08 Physically it would be difficult. I mean it would be sad just just because it would be a sad thing
01:09:15 But it would also be sad for me in particular just because
01:09:18 you know
01:09:20 selling selling books selling the books has been like
01:09:24 a pretty it's been pretty good in terms of like return on investment like it's always been
01:09:30 moderately successful so that would be like
01:09:33 kind of a kind of a
01:09:36 bummer for that for me
01:09:38 I don't know
01:09:40 I was anticipating
01:09:42 I mean the vapors to Kickstarter did pretty well
01:09:45 I was anticipating that slime and punishment might do even bigger numbers
01:09:49 Which would be very exciting
01:09:51 uh
01:09:54 But
01:09:56 I don't know
01:10:00 Everything is bad
01:10:01 Like I looked at I looked at kablam again
01:10:03 You know kablam is where I printed vapors and it it didn't seem like the prices there were like significantly different than they were in the past
01:10:11 So, you know what? I think they're just making it up. I think much like covid itself the uh
01:10:17 The paper shortage is probably a hoax
01:10:21 You know what I mean? Yeah, I mean paper does grow on trees. It literally does trees everywhere
01:10:26 What are we even fucking talking about? You know, this is bullshit. It's it's all it's all
01:10:31 liberal media something something
01:10:34 um
01:10:35 Oh man, wait
01:10:37 This is totally off topic, but speaking of the liberal media, uh, do you see that the may is having her kid?
01:10:45 Uh, why would that be liberal media? Why would you tell me about this? Because the kill stream because the kill stream hates the
01:10:52 The kill stream is bravely standing against the tyranny and the scourge of the liberal why would you
01:10:57 Think that I would ever want to know about any of that
01:11:01 I don't know because I you like to keep abreast of the of the current state
01:11:06 of the world
01:11:09 That's not the world
01:11:11 It is
01:11:12 It's it's it's the most important thing we could be talking about right now
01:11:18 Well, I hope the baby is okay. I hope yeah
01:11:23 Yeah in the long term in the short term and the long term really
01:11:27 Really hoping really hoping things don't work out the way they probably will work out for that kid
01:11:32 Uh
01:11:35 Yeah, um
01:11:37 Good luck
01:11:39 child
01:11:40 Good luck child good luck child
01:11:43 What can I what else can I say?
01:11:45 um
01:11:48 Uh, yeah, I think I think she's like given birth like like did like this week or something like like one minute ago
01:11:54 I think I heard that like her water broke or something like her water. Why did you hear about people?
01:11:59 People were talking about it in my in my discord server somebody somebody said somebody said that like
01:12:06 Her water was breaking and she said like uh, Ethan. No, no, no, we don't have to go to the hospital
01:12:11 Just now finish your stream finish your stream or whatever
01:12:16 Uh, that's what I heard. I don't I don't know um
01:12:20 But uh, yeah supposedly I don't know so that's bad and I don't like it. Um
01:12:26 But uh, you know
01:12:28 Easy come easy go
01:12:30 Whatever that means
01:12:32 What does that mean in this context? I have no idea. Don't worry about it. Um
01:12:39 Damn, well, that's all what else. I don't know. Uh, I don't have any I don't have any notes this week
01:12:46 Speaking just briefly on the lord of ghosts at Kickstarter reward stuff
01:12:50 I have labels now, but I have been holding off using them because I found this company
01:12:57 Called a black box a black box dot cool
01:13:00 Apparently they are a Kickstarter backer
01:13:03 Like reward assist program. Yeah, you tell them what you need to send
01:13:09 And uh, where you live and you know, you're a Kickstarter link, please and then they'll give you a quote for
01:13:15 Handling all of the shipping to all over the place
01:13:19 And I'm like that sounds so helpful. I would love to do that
01:13:23 This service sounds like I'm its demographic
01:13:26 It sure does so they're gonna send me a quote
01:13:29 tomorrow at the latest
01:13:31 Um on monday and I'll I'll if the quote is like reasonable
01:13:36 I'll be using them
01:13:37 if not, then I'll be I'll be printing out labels on label paper and
01:13:42 and
01:13:44 Going insane for a few weeks, but either way, uh, I have all the pieces
01:13:49 You know, so it's it's not gonna take too much longer
01:13:52 Let me know how that goes because I mean if they're if they're a good service and their price
01:13:57 Point is reasonable. I mean, that's the kind of thing I might make use of in the future
01:14:01 Yeah
01:14:03 they they say they they um
01:14:06 A lot of kick starters are like for creative things. They they work with like board game people like uh, oh, yeah
01:14:13 People who make board games on Kickstarter and it's like difficult to send stuff around
01:14:17 Oh, yeah, and so they they made that service because they understand that artists are not smart
01:14:22 And then they don't know how to do it. That's right. That's true
01:14:26 um, I um
01:14:30 Damn
01:14:32 Wish I uh
01:14:34 I wish
01:14:36 Making I wish that making the book were not hard
01:14:40 I actually have a I have a lot to do
01:14:43 For you would you would think that like formatting the pages of a book would just be like, uh, open up like a
01:14:50 Open up like a photoshop document. Uh, you know make a square center it. Uh done
01:14:56 Uh, not not really there's like
01:14:59 I kind of I kind of got to go through like I'll have like a standard layout
01:15:04 And then but then like I kind of got to go through every individual page and like like because because they're not all quite
01:15:09 Some of them are like four most of them are four images. Some of them will be three or two
01:15:13 I kind of got to like customize each one or most of them or a lot of them to a certain extent
01:15:17 And then I have to write I have to write the index section
01:15:21 I'm actually gonna I don't even know what it's it's going to be
01:15:24 I don't know how long it's going to be but I feel like there's going to be a lot to say
01:15:27 In the index section. It's going to be a lot of words
01:15:31 It's going to probably increase these page count
01:15:34 significantly
01:15:36 It's probably use like a moderately small font just to avoid it being like a big like additional print cost
01:15:44 Uh, but anyway, there's a lot a lot to do with that
01:15:47 I think the the reason the the author notes in the homestuck books and the problem sleuth books are at the bottom
01:15:54 Is to save on
01:15:55 like an index
01:15:57 Yeah, because because the the like the page is the same like shape as the panels in homestuck
01:16:04 but like
01:16:05 There's no very rarely. Do they actually fill the entire page with one of the panels?
01:16:11 They'll have like
01:16:12 Because they have all text underneath them
01:16:14 They have like terezi do
01:16:16 The do the thing and then it's like they have the text with the image above it
01:16:20 And they have like maybe three panels per page with their texts
01:16:23 And if there's a pestilog that takes up and it's like
01:16:27 With that there's a lot of space to have author notes at the bottom without like
01:16:32 Compromising too much on like
01:16:35 Showing the pages in full. That's true
01:16:39 That's true actually and you know, I you know, I pulled out my problem sleuth
01:16:43 Uh book to like look at the layout
01:16:45 And yeah, I did notice that a lot of it is there is a lot of blank space
01:16:49 At the bottom of of many pages
01:16:52 Like the the images are all they're definitely there's like set towards the top and there's blank space at the bottom four
01:16:57 You know, it's potentially there could be text there and then at the very bottom. There's the
01:17:03 There's the running commentary
01:17:05 I I don't know. I kind of like the idea of like a dedicated index section though. I think I just
01:17:11 It
01:17:13 Yeah, damn it. Okay. Now I'm in a conundrum because on the one hand
01:17:17 um, yeah, my the four images like like the
01:17:21 The the the the the aspect ratio of the images
01:17:26 Most most even landscape oriented book layouts
01:17:30 They're not long enough. They generally they do will have some wasted vertical space. It's almost unavoidable
01:17:38 uh
01:17:39 So then I'm I'm I'm left with the choice of either I waste that space
01:17:44 or I
01:17:46 I could do a running commentary page by page and then that space would be used
01:17:50 Or you know, if I do if I do in the back of the book, there might be some some waste which is unfortunate
01:17:55 so
01:17:56 so like, um, you've got
01:17:59 You've got the four
01:18:01 For most tweets. There's four images the same size. Yeah
01:18:05 Uh
01:18:06 And like putting all four of those like with their sides touching
01:18:10 In a grid on one page would be too
01:18:13 Like would make the pages too wide or uh, no, well, here. Well, here's like a
01:18:18 I was working on it the other day. Here's what I was kind of
01:18:22 Um, hold on. I gotta I gotta post a
01:18:26 Here's what I was kind of like mocking up
01:18:30 Like, uh
01:18:31 this is
01:18:33 This is this is including like a bleed
01:18:36 So, I mean, this isn't even you know what this isn't even that bad actually like yeah, there's a little bit of space at the bottom
01:18:41 But it's not even it's not even that bad
01:18:43 You know what I was like futzing with it the other day and thinking like oh, there's extra space. Oh, I hate this wasted space
01:18:50 But like this is fine
01:18:52 Is is the white like the bleed area? No
01:18:56 Oh, sorry. No the white on the outside is like ignore it
01:19:00 That's just the photoshop file you're working in. Yeah, no the the black the black is the page
01:19:05 Or here, um, let me uh
01:19:08 here
01:19:10 there
01:19:12 Yeah, yeah
01:19:13 The corner ignore the red in the corner. That's irrelevant
01:19:17 Uh, so they would be
01:19:19 Some yeah, this something like for text if you got something to say or no, no, no, I think I think this is
01:19:26 I don't shit is this post because I because I got the template from mixam
01:19:32 No, wait, uh, this is uh
01:19:37 I'm not sure if this includes the bleed or not whatever this is whatever something something like this, you know
01:19:44 So, yeah, there there would be there. Okay, there would be some space for a commentary at the bottom
01:19:49 There might be a few
01:19:51 There might be a few cases where
01:19:54 I would want to write like a substantial amount that maybe I would want more than just the bottom
01:20:00 Uh margin for I guess in those cases I could make a little asterisk and have a little like
01:20:06 index section at the back
01:20:08 but on the other hand, I kind of just like the idea of having it of it being a
01:20:13 Uh an infinite jest style back of the book index section. I just kind of think that's funny
01:20:20 Yeah, I mean, whatever you feel like. Yeah
01:20:23 I I remembered that I was at one point thinking of making like a bell jpebook
01:20:28 And I started like laying out
01:20:30 some pages
01:20:32 Yeah, just sort of like this sort of thing. I like that
01:20:37 Would it be would it be square pages?
01:20:40 Yeah, the square pages would be pretty square. Yeah. Um, just because
01:20:46 Actually, I don't know why I think it was just because the problem sleuth books were square and I liked that
01:20:51 The problem sleuth books, they're not they're not quite square. They're like, um, they're like a little bit less
01:20:56 They're like a little bit more than square. They're like eight by eight and a half or so. I measured I measured mine
01:21:02 Uh because uh, you know
01:21:04 I was I was looking at this at this stuff
01:21:08 Uh, okay
01:21:10 I've got my
01:21:13 I still don't know whether I would want to make a bell jpebook
01:21:17 It's it's like a fun idea of a project
01:21:20 but it's still like bell jpe is
01:21:24 maybe not like
01:21:26 The thing people would really want
01:21:29 I don't know
01:21:31 How many how many would it be a lot of pages?
01:21:33 I think it would be a lot of pages. Oh, how don't I think I may like
01:21:38 I got up to
01:21:39 page
01:21:41 What's this page 35 of the book would be where tiki is introduced
01:21:47 I didn't I didn't finish doing that one. Let me page 34
01:21:51 I think it would be like maybe a hundred two hundred pages
01:21:54 um
01:21:56 200 yeah
01:21:57 Slime and well, I slime and punishment is gonna be like a hundred and
01:22:02 180 or something a hundred and seventy hundred and eighty and that that's not including the index
01:22:08 Hey, see I can't remember whether I'm that number is referring to like the number of panels I have
01:22:14 um
01:22:15 Because obviously I can fit multiple panels on a single page. Yeah, and uh, some panels are less important than others
01:22:22 If they're like like just sort of moving from one point to another. I like I like this like alternating a left and right
01:22:29 Thing you got going on here
01:22:32 Yeah, I think it's pretty good. It's pretty good
01:22:34 I feel like it would be a cool project once I don't have um
01:22:38 I don't know more pressing projects
01:22:41 Happening. Hmm. Yeah
01:22:44 I could have like give and take dot say and you can buy the bell j-book. I wouldn't I probably wouldn't do a kickstarter for it
01:22:49 Uh, or would I I don't know in a in a in a in a bit that I'm gonna rip off from the lord of ghosts kickstarter
01:22:57 What the hell did it it's not showing it whatever this this image. I just posted is uh, it's it shows the the bleed
01:23:06 It shows it with the bleed and like uh, it's kind of it's kind of narrow on the edges
01:23:10 I I really don't like how it's like coming coming coming close to the edge
01:23:14 But it's got like a more substantial margin at the top. I don't like that
01:23:18 There's more space on the right because this is like a left page. So, you know, there's more space in the middle towards the spine
01:23:24 Um, it'd be reversed for a right hand page
01:23:27 Ah, there's just a lot
01:23:29 There's a lot of lot to fuck with there's a lot to fuck with in terms of uh, so
01:23:34 What are you what are you copying from from lord of ghosts? Oh, right? Um, I'm gonna do a when I kickstart that I'll do a, uh
01:23:43 stretch goal zine
01:23:45 and the zine will be, uh
01:23:48 Nuts the beginning. Do you know what that is?
01:23:50 I
01:23:51 Yes, the like timeline conversions or like it's split whether or not you have the salted cashews or the unsalted
01:23:59 The salted almonds are the unsalted cashews. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, uh, or well
01:24:06 Uh, I mean, there is the there is the the secret brazil nut ending, but uh, we shouldn't talk about that
01:24:14 So, yeah, I'll do that as like a little uh
01:24:17 choose your own adventure, uh
01:24:19 probably like staple bound, uh
01:24:23 Zine it'll be like 13 pages
01:24:27 Uh, no, no, I'll probably be a little longer than that
01:24:30 Maybe like 20 something because it's all all these multiple versions. Uh
01:24:35 How many pages is the red man zine by the way?
01:24:39 That's about a hundred pages. It's a that's big for a zine
01:24:43 That is big for it's got like a flat like it's perfect bound. It's not like stapled
01:24:49 Oh, that's a lot more. That's not even a zine. That's not even a zine. You can't call a zine if it's perfect bound. That's a book
01:24:57 Uh, uh-oh
01:25:00 I got caught
01:25:01 That's a book my friends
01:25:04 Dang it. Now people will know I made a book
01:25:07 Fuck you fool. Um, I'm very disappointed. I want my money back
01:25:14 Uh, okay, thanks, but you won't get your red man. Oh wait. Oh
01:25:19 Oh, well, well, no, never mind then. No, actually
01:25:23 No, I want I want well, I want the money back
01:25:25 But I want to still have the thing that I paid for
01:25:28 Can we can we arrange something like that perhaps?
01:25:32 Uh, sure, I'll send it to you and then you complain and then I'll capitulate instantly. Okay. Okay. Good. I receive red man comic
01:25:39 You receive no money from me
01:25:42 Uh
01:25:44 We can make this work. I think
01:25:47 Um, you I receive red man comic you receive less than what we agreed upon
01:25:52 Hmm. Hmm. You you drive a hard bargain there
01:25:57 Uh, yeah
01:25:59 So let's uh, let's see
01:26:03 What uh, what else what else? Um, like I said, I have no notes this week. Um
01:26:09 I did nothing of note besides release the game and play Hades
01:26:13 uh
01:26:15 Well, you deserve it. Thanks
01:26:19 uh
01:26:20 Anything I've been doing is um
01:26:24 Is waiting for
01:26:25 Well, at first I found out about like the
01:26:29 The the black box company and now I'm just been I've just been waiting for them to get back to me with the quote
01:26:35 Oh
01:26:36 So I've been playing uh animal crossing
01:26:40 Pocket camp. I think I talked about that before you mentioned it. Yeah
01:26:44 That's been fun. I have animals
01:26:47 I got Marshall. I got Raymond. Oh my god. Uh
01:26:51 The best ones
01:26:53 Yeah, I found all the best ones
01:26:56 Um, I think there's that new one new ish one
01:27:01 Uh, what's his name?
01:27:03 Bunny boy like turquoise
01:27:06 Femboy bunny that was like ha ha. It's so feminine for a boy bunny
01:27:12 I don't remember that one
01:27:15 It's a new one new with the
01:27:18 Switch game. I think
01:27:20 But that's a possible. I can I can find that one and and add it to my my campsite
01:27:26 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Good. Good
01:27:30 And uh, yeah, it's just that's just a fun game
01:27:33 Uh, is it you said it's different from
01:27:38 New horizons
01:27:40 Yeah, I mean there's a lot there's obviously less you can do on a mobile device
01:27:44 But like I haven't played the animal crossings. I've just seen people play it
01:27:49 seems to be just
01:27:51 Good like you go around and you shake trees to get at things you catch bugs you catch fish
01:27:58 You give those things to the animals as little gift bags and they're like wow, thanks
01:28:03 And then they give you crafting resources
01:28:07 With which you make furniture
01:28:09 To furnish your campsite. Mm-hmm. And then if you have the right furniture animals
01:28:14 Who like that furniture can be invited to be at your camp. Very nice
01:28:20 Very nice
01:28:22 Uh
01:28:23 And and like that that loop has not gotten tiring or tedious yet
01:28:28 This is uh surprisingly
01:28:30 And it's just it's a good one. It's a good mobile game. I like that. I like that they did that the
01:28:36 The the Hades loop has not gotten tedious for me
01:28:39 Although I was very
01:28:41 I was really mad. I was really mad. Let me tell you
01:28:45 When I realized
01:28:47 I had thought that diamonds I had thought I figured out that oh diamonds are just for like
01:28:52 They're just for like extra shit. They're just for like, you know, bullshit cosmetic stuff
01:28:57 So I bought a song. I bought like a soundtrack song for one diamond
01:29:01 And then a day later
01:29:03 I realized like, oh my god, I've earned all the diamonds I can like get easily
01:29:08 And I'm one diamond short
01:29:10 of unlocking arabus gates
01:29:13 And I fucking wasted my fucking diamond on a stupid soundtrack
01:29:18 I'm fucking gonna kill everyone. Yeah, you can yeah, you can buy like in-game music that plays at the music stand in the
01:29:27 Like courtyard or whatever
01:29:29 Right
01:29:30 And you get diamonds you get diamonds by slaying the lernian bone hydra, which is the boss of the second area
01:29:37 Well, you get a you get them in a couple ways, but the easiest way to get them is by slaying the hydra
01:29:43 With each weapon you get a one diamond for doing it with that weapon and you get one for doing it at different heat levels
01:29:51 which is uh
01:29:53 Sort of a difficulty setting you can like turn up for yourself if you want more rewards
01:29:58 So I had completed I had gotten all the diamonds that I could get that way
01:30:03 And then I was like, ah, fuck
01:30:06 I'm short of a an upgrade that would add like a new like sort of type of room to the dungeon
01:30:12 Uh, I ended up getting I had to like trade some shit
01:30:15 I had to like gather up some other crap and trade one for a diamond
01:30:18 And then I got the extra one and I got the I unlocked the room
01:30:21 But I was mad for a minute. I was like, oh, I wish I hadn't spent that diamond on that song
01:30:27 Oh, well
01:30:29 Uh, you got tricked. I I
01:30:32 It was bad conveyance. It was bad conveyance
01:30:37 They didn't they didn't signpost clearly enough that this thing that I had to slay the hydra to obtain was valuable and I should care about it
01:30:44 Uh
01:30:47 There was okay, we I just thought of one more thing one more thing. Um, I was talking
01:30:52 to Nate
01:30:54 about
01:30:55 Radcon funds
01:30:58 and I
01:31:00 I think I'm I'm I'm I think I'm taking over. I think I'm taking over a
01:31:05 PCP
01:31:06 Like accounting duties from him. He is handing them off to me soon
01:31:11 and also
01:31:13 Uh, we were talking about
01:31:15 The expenses that I have incurred while doing stuff like getting road to radcon done
01:31:21 And doing the dojin
01:31:23 And other such things and we went over the expenses
01:31:27 And uh, I think I'm gonna get paid. I'm gonna get that money that I spent
01:31:32 This is money that I already spent that I spent my own money that was PCP money
01:31:36 So I'm just getting reimbursed for that
01:31:38 and then
01:31:39 we talked again about the uh, the brad garlinghouse diss track music video
01:31:46 and the ova
01:31:48 And we once again and we once again Nate said
01:31:51 I'm gonna say I'm just gonna say it. I'm just gonna say it Nate said to me. Okay, Ben
01:31:56 I I'm gonna set a deadline for myself. I will have the
01:32:00 uh
01:32:01 Music video done
01:32:03 He said next friday
01:32:06 So that will be the friday after this episode
01:32:09 Or that will be a week from the day this episode comes out
01:32:13 So the day the episode after this comes out
01:32:17 Nate said he would and he told me he would have the brad garlinghouse diss track music video
01:32:24 These are his words. These are his words
01:32:26 Uh, all right, and now and now okay. I can't guarantee he didn't say that it would be published
01:32:31 He said it would be done
01:32:33 So he might
01:32:34 It might be the case that he has he hasn't finished then and then maybe we publish it like the next day or something
01:32:39 Um, so if it's not posted when this comes out, it's not quite time to
01:32:46 Call him out on shenanigans, but uh soon
01:32:50 Soon thereafter shortly thereafter
01:32:53 uh
01:32:55 I asked him
01:32:56 Do you do you care if like we talk if talk a little bit about like money funds?
01:33:02 um, I mean sure is
01:33:04 part of the
01:33:05 The thing I was concerned. I because I I had not seen like the money
01:33:11 Like he's just sort of kept it in escrow or whatever for this whole time
01:33:15 Uh, and I was concerned like
01:33:18 damn, what if we like spent it all and um
01:33:23 Like like what if it's what if it's all been spent and it's gone and we're not getting
01:33:27 And there's not going to be any money to pay us out by the time it's it's done. Turns out no
01:33:32 That's not the case
01:33:34 Nate said that like even after everything there's like
01:33:38 $15,000 just there just sitting
01:33:42 To be to be dispersed as soon as as soon as he is done
01:33:47 Well as soon as he's done with those videos and uh, and I get uh
01:33:53 Kaiju to finish the damn the damn dojin
01:33:57 Yes, Kaiju. It's not Kaiju's fault Kaiju said he would work on it as soon as he has time, but he has been
01:34:03 He has been busy with uh, his editing work for totally not mark, which he told me was going to be the case so
01:34:11 It's uh, it's uh, I I accepted that
01:34:15 Because I don't know he he said
01:34:18 He said I should consider finding someone else if I want it done sooner
01:34:21 And I was like, okay, I'll think about it
01:34:25 But other than like I genuinely don't know who else I would ask because I I really feel like his style is a pretty good fit for
01:34:32 uh eds stuff because I want to use what ed got done and uh
01:34:39 So like
01:34:40 That's good
01:34:41 And like I don't I don't know any other I have like I don't know I have not found any other artists who would be like
01:34:48 Oh, yeah, I could get that guy to do it and that would look fine
01:34:52 Like I just have I don't like maybe there's someone out there, but I don't I don't
01:34:57 I don't know I don't haven't seen him
01:35:01 I
01:35:02 Anyway, those are the I mean those are the things that have to get done before we get that money
01:35:06 We'll get like a few thousand bucks a piece. It'll be pretty sick
01:35:10 Yeah, and then finally
01:35:12 um
01:35:14 And finally the curse of radcon 4 will be lifted finally. Yeah, yeah the curse
01:35:19 God
01:35:21 It's been
01:35:22 So long that I can't even remember
01:35:25 Yeah
01:35:26 what like
01:35:28 If I have been reimbursed for anything or or not
01:35:31 Well, Nate has it all gotta go Nate has it all in records
01:35:35 Apparently he told me I had thought that I had been reimbursed for like my uh, not my travel expenses
01:35:41 But like my expenses while there like, you know food food and stuff
01:35:46 Uh, apparently I was not like
01:35:48 He he told me like now I have it I have it down here on the
01:35:52 Spreadsheet that like now you you listed like 400 dollars worth of expenses that have not been reimbursed. I'm like, yes
01:36:00 Fuck yeah
01:36:02 I'd have to really go back and
01:36:04 check
01:36:05 Wait, well if you if you already told him if you already reported him then like well, that's the thing
01:36:10 I don't I don't even remember if I reported
01:36:13 Everything well if you didn't I I feel like I I feel like I I like put
01:36:18 like
01:36:20 uh receipts
01:36:22 Somewhere, uh, yeah, I did I was meeting I kept all my receipts from the trip and then I posted screenshots of them
01:36:29 for him in the all business
01:36:31 uh
01:36:32 channel
01:36:34 And that's and I just did that and like that's that's all I had
01:36:38 Yeah, I guess the main thing I would want is like my plane ticket because I was part of the the Kickstarter
01:36:43 Yes, the pay for travel probably. Yeah, probably that 400 includes my plane tickets
01:36:51 And probably yours as well need to be paid out
01:36:54 along with everything else
01:36:57 Oh, yeah, that would have been big for you
01:37:00 because of a international flight and all
01:37:03 Yeah, did you not did you know over though? Did you not get uh?
01:37:07 Did you not get that covered?
01:37:10 Um, I don't remember it's been so many years
01:37:14 It's been two years multiple years
01:37:18 Or
01:37:20 wait
01:37:21 I mean red con 2 would have been it would have been around this time of year right like late march
01:37:28 I think on 2 or sorry red con 4
01:37:31 It would it would have now. Yeah, it was it was march. It was pre. It was just on the cusp of covid
01:37:36 So we're probably scary. No, so we're probably in like
01:37:40 Yeah, this this we were like right around the second anniversary or something like that. Oh
01:37:45 Yeah, it's so weird. How weird is it?
01:37:49 Like what watching the uh the red con 2 documentary and being like red con 1 and 2 were like four months apart
01:37:57 So bizarre
01:38:00 Yeah, well
01:38:03 Yeah, well things change. Yeah, well, that's life. That's life. I don't want to say about it. Yeah, I mean sure
01:38:11 Uh
01:38:14 I don't know that's all I got
01:38:17 That's all I got this week. Um
01:38:19 Oh, have you been reading one piece?
01:38:21 No
01:38:23 You're gonna get caught up. It's very good fame famously. I do not read one piece
01:38:28 Uh, I should watch it. I read it
01:38:31 I yeah, you know, you know what, uh, there's a there's a lot of things that I have been putting off doing and being like
01:38:38 Nah, I'll do it after the game's done. Well
01:38:42 Now the game's done. So maybe reading one piece
01:38:46 Should be one of those things that I do
01:38:48 Uh
01:38:49 Yeah, I should get caught up
01:38:51 I know I've been saying that and saying that and saying that but I really mean it this time
01:38:56 I really mean it. I'm downloading
01:38:58 Uh
01:39:01 Voice mails by the way, I don't know if we're gonna do them right yet, but I feel like we're getting
01:39:06 Closer to that time
01:39:09 I mean at the moment
01:39:11 Like all the things that are going on in my life that are major
01:39:16 I've already mentioned. Mm-hmm
01:39:18 And I'm mostly just sort of like enjoying the fact that it's getting a bit warmer. Yeah, and uh
01:39:24 Oh, there's there's a bumblebee every so often in that nice sunlight. That's good. Yeah, I went to the
01:39:33 I went to the post office the other day
01:39:35 I had like legitimately not been out of my house and like probably more than a week
01:39:39 Like I had not stepped outside
01:39:42 And I was shocked to see that. Oh, it's uh, it's warm now
01:39:45 That's weird
01:39:47 That's pretty cool. I guess
01:39:50 But I feel I have gone um
01:39:53 I have gone with the kids these days are calling goblin mode
01:39:57 I feel like they calling it that. Yeah, I feel like a monster
01:40:01 I feel like a devil who doesn't belong in society anymore. I feel like a wretched little
01:40:06 little uh
01:40:09 Little hand-wringing thing scurrying about I don't want anyone to see me
01:40:14 Uh, that's that's like you're like those little little bugs in in uh
01:40:20 Oh, no, not little little bugs the little scrabbly guys in blood boron you kill them you get little blood. Oh, it's the little tight night. Uh
01:40:28 Tight night equivalents. Dark souls tight night scarabs or whatever they're called. Yeah. Yeah
01:40:33 Exactly. Yes, exactly like that. Exactly. Um
01:40:37 You have great like powerful loot
01:40:40 It feels and everyone's trying to try and gonna try and squash you for it
01:40:45 Feels bad. I feel like I look terrible
01:40:48 Uh, I don't know what to do about it
01:40:51 Uh, just look good. Duh. Yeah easy. Yeah, you know what?
01:40:57 You're inspiring an inspired an inspiring message of hope
01:41:01 Uh for today's youth. Just get good. I Ie me
01:41:05 Yeah
01:41:07 You know what?
01:41:08 Never thought about it like that
01:41:10 And I never will
01:41:13 But anyway, the point was it was very warm out. It was like all of a sudden it was 70 degrees and I'm like, well
01:41:20 Damn, I guess, uh
01:41:22 I guess my excuse for uh
01:41:25 I'm running out of excuses to never leave my house. Uh
01:41:29 COVID's like
01:41:31 Nobody nobody cares about COVID anymore
01:41:33 Uh, it's not it's not even winter now. It's warm. So like fuck
01:41:38 I gotta go to a local park and pet a dog. Jesus christ. Don't don't
01:41:46 Don't fucking say such things
01:41:48 Uh
01:41:52 Do you have like a local park near
01:41:54 A local park
01:41:56 I mean there
01:41:58 There there is one that I there's one kind of I know there is one kind of near a sort of uh
01:42:05 Street crossing like square nearby
01:42:09 Uh, but it's sort of off the road and I have not actually gone to it
01:42:15 Long story short, there are parks. I just have not I have not really seen any of them
01:42:20 I guess I moved in
01:42:22 I don't I don't go to parks. Do you go to parks?
01:42:25 Yeah, I love going to parks
01:42:29 I I would never think I would never think to go to a park
01:42:34 It's just sort of um, you know, you go outside, but you're far away as far away as possible from traffic sounds
01:42:43 and
01:42:45 You know sometimes there's nice grass sometimes there's a lake to look at I don't look at like ducks and stuff
01:42:50 I don't know if there are any parks
01:42:52 Around where I live that are big enough that you would be like away from traffic sounds
01:42:58 Yeah, I mean, I guess it depends if if you're in like a big city or
01:43:03 Or a place where the parks are small
01:43:06 like
01:43:07 even just
01:43:10 Surrounding yourself with tall things that are not like made of concrete and instead are made of wood and they're trees
01:43:16 I mean, I go to the I go to the Boston Commons sometimes
01:43:20 Uh for various reasons. That's that's a park. It's not huge, but it's it's probably it's the biggest park
01:43:27 around I think
01:43:30 It's probably a bigger is that the place with
01:43:32 Uh
01:43:34 Wait, was that the place?
01:43:35 I think I went there. I think you probably did and we probably and we probably played pokemon go. Yeah, I think you did
01:43:43 Go there and and and another time
01:43:46 I think you and
01:43:48 Munchy did like a
01:43:50 Like a with rfck con or something with signs. Yes. Yes the slime. I remember watching a stream
01:43:58 Walking around a big green area slime war slime slime war now slime war now
01:44:05 Uh, yeah, that was in the common
01:44:07 Uh, it was also it was also the place where I went to uh, so you see andrew yang
01:44:14 Give us a beat when he was running for president
01:44:18 Uh
01:44:19 It was where we went for the when it was cold for that time you were here. Yeah, so you yeah, that's the common
01:44:26 I go there once in a while
01:44:28 um
01:44:29 Just for various uh reasons
01:44:33 I gotta go
01:44:36 Um, I actually after this is over. I gotta go to the
01:44:42 I've been meaning to go back to medford. I moved so my old
01:44:48 PO box is in medford
01:44:51 Which is kind of annoying to get to it was probably like 45 minutes to get there. I gotta go by bus
01:44:56 And I gotta I gotta check my po box because I'm sure that some packages have probably been returned to sender and are sitting in
01:45:02 My po box and need to get them
01:45:04 Uh
01:45:06 And uh, but I don't want to uh, it's annoying
01:45:11 So but I I'll probably do that today actually because I gotta go out to summerville for some other shit
01:45:17 um
01:45:20 I guess it's the first day of spring. It's march 20th
01:45:22 It's also my sister's birthday. So I should call her the sister who famously said you're a dog. You're a dog and I'm sick of it
01:45:30 Uh, it's her birthday today. I should give her a call after this
01:45:35 Hmm. Anyway, I'm just rambling now. What am I talking about?
01:45:39 Uh, nothing nothing nothing
01:45:43 Shall we go to voicemail? Yeah, let's go to voicemail
01:45:46 Oh
01:45:49 Oh, man, I made I made two ingredient cookies yesterday
01:45:53 Shit was so cash
01:45:56 The way two what cookies I talked about these two ingredient cookies the ones that are made
01:46:02 Of bananas and oats
01:46:04 Oh, okay. Yeah, I mentioned these. Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna experiment next next batch. I make I'm gonna experiment with uh
01:46:13 adding
01:46:15 Because it's like they're actually I'm actually disappointed. They're actually kind of high calorie
01:46:19 Like a batch of like eight cookies
01:46:23 I mean moderately large cookies, but still eight cookies like a thousand calories
01:46:27 And that's a lot
01:46:29 Um, so I'm gonna experiment with sub substituting
01:46:33 This might be the worst thing ever. I'm gonna try and substitute some of the oats with psyllium powder
01:46:39 Which is pure fiber
01:46:41 Is so it's not psyllium. So it's non caloric. I don't know. It might be horrible. It might be just disgusting
01:46:48 Uh, but it might be fine and great and then it would be
01:46:51 It'd be very silly
01:46:55 Yeah, um
01:46:58 Do you want me here? I'll I'll post uh
01:47:01 Oh, yeah, sorry
01:47:02 Uh, are you gonna post them? Yeah, sorry. I'm getting them. Uh, this one is called
01:47:07 Sorry, I've got a lot of uh, fucking folders open at the moment. This one is called this is for this one is for Gib and not Ben
01:47:16 Okay, so the both of us will be listening. Um, three two one go
01:47:22 Hey Gib, uh, you said
01:47:24 previously
01:47:26 that
01:47:28 On your money spenders podcast you have gone over
01:47:32 details on
01:47:34 development of pumpkin alley
01:47:36 um, some yeah
01:47:39 Very vague details without
01:47:42 spoiling it
01:47:44 Uh, how much detail did you go into into the process?
01:47:49 a lot a little
01:47:51 no
01:47:52 Biden find out
01:47:54 Biden find out. I mean Biden will find out. Oh, he's he fucked around now. He's gonna find out
01:48:01 uh
01:48:03 I feel like there's there's not like
01:48:07 A wealth of information about like the process of making the game
01:48:11 I can't remember exactly what I say
01:48:13 but like
01:48:15 I wasn't like documenting it like very rigorously and I wasn't programming it either so like
01:48:21 How the game works
01:48:23 Is like secondhand information that I get from like watching charlie struggle with something
01:48:28 And I'm like we workshop like possible solutions to problems and
01:48:33 and stuff like that
01:48:35 um when it comes to like
01:48:37 What I was doing for the game
01:48:40 I was doing animation, but I don't know how to like talk about the process of doing animation for a 3d thing
01:48:48 I don't know. I can't remember
01:48:51 Oh
01:48:52 That reminds me I I forgot to uh
01:48:55 I forgot to record that uh that I said I was going to do a patreon podcast and I haven't done it yet
01:49:01 I'll do I'll do it this week and hopefully have that out before this episode comes out
01:49:05 I meant to have it out by the time the last episode went out, but I didn't uh
01:49:09 oops
01:49:11 Uh, whoops whoops. Yes, exactly
01:49:15 Uh
01:49:16 Okay, next one

01:49:34 Where's the other chopstick going?
01:49:37 It's gotta go somewhere
01:49:39 Ow, how are you gonna pick things up with chopsticks?
01:49:43 Is she gonna put one in her eyes and then you combine your powers to pick up the food that?
01:49:50 God
01:49:51 Stop no
01:49:55 Disgusting. I'm just I'm just thinking. I'm just there. Just read the practicality. Oh
01:50:01 Good, I'm glad somebody's thinking about the
01:50:05 the consequences
01:50:07 I don't want to talk about this anymore. It's terrible
01:50:10 Uh, next voicemail is called, uh, texas anti trans stuff as of march 13th
01:50:18 3 2 1 go. I'm a little late so I'm responding to you talking about this two weeks ago
01:50:23 Hopefully I'm not just repeating information someone else said but I want to clarify what's going on in texas with the anti trans stuff
01:50:27 The first thing is that it's not new legislation. There's no new bill here
01:50:30 Essentially texas attorney general ken paxson out of the blue released a statement saying gender affirming health care constitutes child abuse
01:50:36 And then greg abbott the governor turned around and was like, yeah, that's definitely true
01:50:39 And i'm gonna issue a directive right now to send cps to investigate families of trans children and threaten to tear them apart
01:50:45 Also, this has the effect that psychologists and shit are required to report trans children to the state
01:50:49 So a lot of clinics just immediately close their doors to adolescents outright
01:50:52 This has been happening families are terrified cps workers were diverted from real cases of child abuse
01:50:57 No checks and balances no need for anything to be passed by other lawmakers just abbott abusing his position to terrorize his citizens
01:51:02 Yeah, I know you don't have to tell me that it's bad
01:51:06 And the first hearing for that was on friday march 11th
01:51:08 state's defense was utterly pathetic and the judge sustained an injunction to prevent the investigations from continuing
01:51:14 Until the next hearing in july ken paxson the attorney general then submitted an appeal the very same day and said that he's not
01:51:20 Going to let the investigation stop. I don't know if he has any way of doing that, but I am kind of fucking terrified at the thought
01:51:25 I'll leave more voicemails if there's more updates before the next show is recorded. This voicemail was left on sunday the 13th
01:51:31 I did hear about I did hear about like a court ruling that the okay. I didn't realize it was not new legislation
01:51:38 I did hear about a court ruling it unconstitutional
01:51:41 uh
01:51:43 So that's good. Hmm, but like it was blocked
01:51:47 by the attorney general
01:51:50 And that and like currently like the judge's ruling was blocked
01:51:57 Is that what I'm trying to think if that was what they said just then
01:52:02 Because like does that mean that in texas like families are still being terrorized by this
01:52:08 new
01:52:09 thing not new thing but like
01:52:12 I am
01:52:13 stuff
01:52:15 Bad thing sucks. I'm unsure. I think it it mean it seems like
01:52:21 What it means is that it's under like uh judicial contention
01:52:26 Like there's it sounds sounds like okay, there is there was a judge ruling against it
01:52:30 but like
01:52:31 Other forces are attempting to combat the ruling
01:52:35 so so until there's a like a a
01:52:38 um
01:52:39 A consensus on that issue
01:52:42 Whatever is happening can continue to happen. I don't I don't exactly know what's happening. I guess I guess uh
01:52:49 uh clinic clinics being closed
01:52:52 Uh because of like the potential legal uh consequences is happening. Uh
01:52:59 Psychologists being forced to out trans children. Yeah, well, it's um
01:53:05 Yeah, I don't I mean I don't know if like
01:53:08 uh, they've
01:53:11 Uh probably it has happens a few times. I don't know. I don't know if it's like a widespread thing
01:53:17 But like I guess it might
01:53:19 From what I've seen it is like definitely a scary thing. I don't know if I've seen
01:53:25 Like specific examples of things happening, but like the precedent is like scary enough. The precedent is pretty scary
01:53:32 I'm
01:53:33 I don't know. I mean I could be wrong, but I
01:53:36 Feel like it like it hasn't there hasn't been like I don't know
01:53:40 there hasn't been like a uh, you know, like
01:53:43 A trans crystal knocked in texas yet, you know, hopefully there won't be
01:53:48 Hopefully like the judge will will stop it before that happens
01:53:53 Ah
01:53:55 2022 is a good it's a good time
01:53:59 Texas be crazy. It's crazy texans
01:54:03 um, that's it
01:54:05 The next one is called Nate bestman and terrible translations
01:54:13 There it is. Uh, yep there three two one go
01:54:17 Okay, so I just rewatched the one piece lecture even though it is the second worst lecture with the first one
01:54:24 Of course being the final fancy one
01:54:26 And one of my big takeaways
01:54:28 Was that then
01:54:30 You really got to tell your stupid brother to stop reading terrible fan translations
01:54:36 Because best guy mr. Nate bestman commits one of the cardinal sins of terrible translation
01:54:44 Where he says something to the tune of
01:54:47 When delfut users get seawater on them they turn into a hammer
01:54:52 now
01:54:54 The reason this is so bad is because the phrase kanazuchi in japanese which literally means hammer
01:55:00 Uh figuratively is often used in japanese as a phrase to mean somebody who can't swim
01:55:06 yeah, so
01:55:08 In a lot of like terrible fan translations, which I assume are just translated with like you will translate
01:55:14 They don't they they just translate that word as hammer. They just go like oh, you're such a hammer
01:55:20 Even though in english that does make any sense
01:55:23 um
01:55:25 But a japanese person would understand it because it just means a person who can't swim. That's what it means. Yeah other pet peeves
01:55:32 A best guy says things like shichibukai
01:55:34 Or tenryubito or kairoseki even though these are just normal japanese words that could be easily translated
01:55:42 They're not like titles or something. These are just words. It sucks. It's terrible. Fuck you. Okay. I I like shibukai
01:55:49 I think it's fun to say it like that. I
01:55:52 Instead of I understand this I understand warlords. I understand this caller's point
01:55:58 Okay, I feel okay. I mean
01:56:02 I'm gonna I'm gonna
01:56:04 I'm gonna extend you
01:56:06 The goodwill to assume caller that you don't think that nate thinks that like literally they turn into hammers
01:56:14 Right like you know that he doesn't mean that so like
01:56:18 Nate knows that he's talking about a colloquialism for not being able to swim a japanese colloquialism a japanese colloquialism
01:56:26 You don't like
01:56:28 That he spent okay. I think you don't like that nate says
01:56:35 That maybe you think that nate presents it almost like a sort of one-piece ism that you turn into a hammer
01:56:42 Is what happens to you when you?
01:56:45 Get water on you as opposed to the reality which is that it is just a common
01:56:49 Japanese phrase maybe it would have been better to not even bother translating it literally and just
01:56:54 Say, you know
01:56:56 You you you become dead weight you become dead weight or something else like an english I feel like similar what phrase
01:57:02 I feel like I just don't agree with this guy
01:57:05 Or maybe you sink like a stone you sink like a stone would maybe be a better translation
01:57:09 That like because I I don't know I grew up reading
01:57:13 translated anime and manga
01:57:15 And I you know, they don't always translate every word. They don't always
01:57:19 A localize every term. Yeah, and so I feel like that's
01:57:25 just sort of the fun
01:57:27 Like flavor of like yeah, I don't know it doesn't have to be one way or the other
01:57:32 I don't mind people who like insist on
01:57:35 Not saying the japanese words or
01:57:37 Or what but like yeah, well what you got to get on my case for saying shibukai or like akatsuki
01:57:43 Like I like saying that I think I think there's some charm
01:57:46 I think there's some charm to a sort of inept translation where you read like oh
01:57:52 He he becomes a hammer and then there's a little asterisk and then you read at the bottom
01:57:56 That's like this is this is a this is a colloquial expression for
01:58:00 Being unable to swim. I mean it feels like it's like self-evident anyway
01:58:04 Like he becomes a hammer in water. It's like well, I know what would happen if a hammer was in water. It would sink
01:58:10 I think
01:58:12 I think I think it's fun
01:58:13 It is also fun and I appreciate I could I appreciate the value of like yeah a localization that
01:58:20 It would probably be a more natural reading experience to an english author
01:58:24 You know or to an english reader if you don't have that and if you just instead of
01:58:30 instead of just saying
01:58:32 He becomes a hammer and then having an asterisk and instead of just
01:58:36 Being you use you use an english phrase like oh if you type water gets on you you'll sink like a stone
01:58:42 You know you'll use like a an english equivalent of like a colloquial phrase
01:58:47 I I think that's you know, it's fun to think about that and that's probably like that's probably a better
01:58:53 You know a better way like a more professional and like cleaner and smoother doesn't take you out of the
01:59:00 Story sort of way to do it
01:59:03 Uh, I guess too, okay
01:59:04 And I understand the argument that like to a japanese speaker
01:59:08 Maybe you would read the word tenryubito
01:59:12 Not as like a
01:59:13 You know a proper noun not as like a name
01:59:15 But just as a phrase the way an english person would read. Oh the celestial dragons
01:59:21 Oh the seven the seven warlords of the sea, you know, you wouldn't think it
01:59:26 Yeah, but I I I kind of like the japanese names. I like shichibukai and tenryubito
01:59:31 I like saying them. Yeah, I understand. I but although I get I get why it's like that's not how it's intended
01:59:37 It's it's not intended to be read as like a word spoken in a different language
01:59:43 So I feel like you know, I'm gonna be a fence sitting centrist and I'm gonna say I see both sides of these
01:59:49 Uh
01:59:51 Yeah, I like saying loro no zoro like what's the enemy?
01:59:55 Oh, did you know that in japanese the r letter is the the r
02:00:10 That's where yeah japanese
02:00:12 it's a it's a fun thing for a teenager to like try and figure out how to say
02:00:18 true not from the right culture to do that that's right that's what I did I
02:00:23 I tried I learned some I got a book on tape learn Japanese from the library when
02:00:28 I was a kid and I learned a little bit of phrasing here and there it was fun
02:00:34 anyway anyway this guy this this caller you got a point but I think you're being
02:00:39 a little too I think you're being a little too serious about it no it's
02:00:47 supposed to be straw hat it just means I mean I mean I mean I guess you yeah you
02:00:51 would make the same I mean I mean I mean actually I mean I guess that makes it
02:00:55 right because they're not they're not calling him some fancy title moogie
02:00:58 wada they're calling they're just calling oh it's interesting it's
02:01:01 straw hat loofy it's more it's colloquial I and I can I can agree and accept that
02:01:07 you are I would to come across as a nerd if I went around saying moogie wada all
02:01:12 the time but I just kind of like it it's over it's like that would be like if in
02:01:17 if in the original they call him like they literally call me oh stood all
02:01:21 had to do theater like there is like they say it like that like it's a it's a
02:01:26 name you know but they didn't anyway next one is oh god this one's gonna suck
02:01:37 this this is voicemail is gonna suck shit it's bad but I'm gonna play it anyway
02:01:42 how to get your podcasts on Spotify Apple podcasts etc. 3 2 1 go apologies if
02:01:51 the Spotify situation has been cleared up already if so feel free to skip this
02:01:56 I'm gonna lose my mind but as somebody with a podcast themselves
02:02:02 it's 12 podcast called tales gets podcast please check it out okay I might be a
02:02:08 modicum of help so the way you upload to platforms such as Apple music or Apple
02:02:15 podcasts and Spotify is that you have to submit an RSS feed this is this is
02:02:22 torture this is torture and so how you updates all the podcasts on like spot
02:02:30 etc. is just by uploading a new podcast to your RSS feeds then it
02:02:35 automatically gets put on all the different platforms okay so really all
02:02:40 you need to do is get your hands on that RSS feed yeah and just uploads the
02:02:45 episodes that aren't in there to it I assume Tom set up the RSS feed and I
02:02:53 don't know how you did it because there's many ways of doing it some you can
02:02:57 make it yourself or you can use like a service to make it so you upload through
02:03:03 that this is literally the worst track down Tom and like steal the RSS feed
02:03:09 like right out of so this is like missing the start uploading this is like how
02:03:14 did you talk for a minute 30 and convey zero information like I know we still
02:03:20 need to get a hold of Tom thanks for thanks like thanks for nothing like I'm
02:03:24 literally angry I'm literally angry at you from for making this like what is
02:03:28 wrong with you why did you think I needed to hear this yes the point is yes
02:03:32 Tom controls the RSS feed yes I know yes Tom is in charge yes oh I just I just
02:03:37 got to get Tom to do it I know that's what I've been saying this week has been
02:03:42 I've gotten a bunch more messages I don't I've got a bunch more messages from
02:03:46 people asking me Ben can you please no I know I asked already but can you please
02:03:50 put them on the podcast apps and like how many fucking times do I have to tell
02:03:54 you I don't have the power Tom's in charge of it Tom has the RSS feed how
02:03:58 many fucking times do you have to hear that's not my fucking problem why are
02:04:02 people still asking me about it how why don't they ask Tom like what could I do
02:04:06 to make it clearer that somebody else is in fucking charge of it I don't get it
02:04:12 who don't ask me again you fucks okay that's it cuz Tom doesn't answer me I
02:04:20 have it's Tom just don't just Tom just ignores me when I ask him about it and
02:04:25 that's and that's the truth that's that's just where we're at with that so now
02:04:29 you know like it's if I I just I just won't I just won't answer anymore I
02:04:35 just won't answer anymore anyone adding me about it cuz like I don't respect it
02:04:40 okay anything else no okay hmm what I don't know I see I see Tom tweeting about
02:04:56 playing Elden Ring yeah like like surely you'd be able to just reply and say oh
02:05:04 yes sorry I'll get around to it like at least that I know what he's doing yeah
02:05:09 no I haven't no he obviously and myself okay okay okay I haven't I haven't dm
02:05:14 him but I've added him you know what you know you know what you know what you know
02:05:19 what okay you know what maybe I'm being maybe I'm being a little bit of bitch
02:05:23 right now because I have not actually do you know what I'm gonna do it right now
02:05:26 I'm gonna do it right now I haven't done it before say hey dm Tom all right and
02:05:34 and and I rescind all my previous anger and if it doesn't get fixed after this
02:05:39 then I will unresend it I had assumed you already dm'd him and he just hadn't
02:05:45 responded that's why I thought no I just added him in the pcp discord which I'm
02:05:49 like he would have seen it obviously like like he maybe not I don't see why
02:05:56 not there we go okay all right message sent I just don't I just don't get it I
02:06:12 just don't get why people keep asking me about it when like I've said like it's
02:06:17 not me I guess I guess I guess just you know for the sake of cosmic justice like
02:06:22 I hope I hope people have been asking Tom too because like there's there's
02:06:27 literally no reason why like I'm the guy like I've said over and over that like
02:06:31 I'm not the guy so it's just it's a little annoying I guess but anyway okay I
02:06:40 sent I sent a dm there I dm'd and now now I have done the extent of
02:06:46 everything I could possibly do about it anyway I fucking hate you voicemailer
02:06:50 fuck you and fuck your podcast next next one is called Nate soundboard there
02:06:59 it is 3 2 1 go dude remember when Nate debuted as soundboard just to leave the
02:07:06 podcast like three episodes later was that all about kind of cringe I don't
02:07:13 know man I don't know like you it's cringe because you wanted to see more of
02:07:18 the sound yeah did you want more soundboard or do you think he just
02:07:21 shouldn't have bothered debuting it what's what's your what's your solution to
02:07:26 this to this cringe conundrum you've presented us with here you already had
02:07:31 it for a stream that in me I think it was just sort of like I figured out how
02:07:34 to make it play during a podcast yeah maybe yeah maybe I don't know I don't
02:07:43 know okay next one is something there it is it is called then you skip one did
02:07:55 I do six seconds oh right sorry yeah that was Ben Saints weekly reminder three
02:08:02 two one go welcome to Ben Saints weekly reminder to go to the library yeah
02:08:11 have you done it yet no not yet I'll do it yeah I'll go to the library I've been
02:08:18 playing Hades I just released the game a few days ago I guess it's been like four
02:08:21 or five days it's been playing video games and setting up book pages I'll go
02:08:28 to the library I'll go to the library one of these days but thanks for the
02:08:34 reminder next one is called Ben's Saint character inconsistencies to come on
02:08:40 writers three two one go when the character of Ben Saints reacted to the
02:08:47 reveal of the new Pokemons he uttered this phrase I haven't played a good
02:08:53 Pokemon game since white two however in his own Pokemon son Nuzlocke he said
02:09:01 this I love this game so no wonder this character is so controversial he is so
02:09:11 inconsistent the writers don't even know what to do with this character I mean
02:09:15 come on man get some consistency into the Ben Saint character now I I remember
02:09:21 like I I had a pretty okay time playing Sun I felt more positively about Sun
02:09:27 while I was playing it than I do in hindsight in hindsight I think it was
02:09:30 pretty underwhelming and I think a lot of the changes they made were bad and I
02:09:34 don't think it's a good direction for the series and I'm not very happy with
02:09:37 it at the time I thought it was okay even so even still I don't think I would
02:09:42 have sighed and said I love this game it just doesn't sound like something I
02:09:47 would say I don't believe you I think you're lying it sounds like the sort of
02:09:52 thing you would say sarcastically maybe something terrible happened yeah yeah
02:09:57 that sounds yeah it sounds about right okay next one is called rip capitalism
02:10:03 three two one go you made it I know we calling a nighter good bye bye thanks see

02:12:18 also give makes really funny puns and I love the occasions when they happen
02:12:23 I love that gal thank you the joker thanks the joker wow I can't believe the joker's a fan
02:12:33 uh yeah specifically the uh oh what's his name
02:12:39 dark knight and joker heath ledger heath ledger heath ledger yeah specifically that joker um
02:12:46 oh no oh no this is just like um oh but this is just like we have a problematic fan who did
02:12:53 terrorism this is just like when when like lauren southern fans like committed all those mass shootings
02:12:58 it's like oh we got a disavow we got a disavow all the actions of the time that was a really good

02:13:15 okay yeah true yeah true uh oh wait I okay I skipped one whatever uh the one 26 is called
02:13:26 I have okay well there's a oh there's an image file attached here let's uh let me get the link
02:13:33 oh it's a it's a phantom's revenge end screen there it is don't
02:13:45 elias are blur out the blur out the image blur out the uh the spoilery part with the image yeah
02:13:51 just show the text that parts you can't we catch no spoilers no spoilers here um okay anyway three
02:13:58 two one go so I just started listening to this podcast around the end of 2021 so I don't have
02:14:05 any nostalgia of what it used to be oh wow but I catch up by randomly listening to previous episodes
02:14:11 that intrigued me now and this wasn't too long ago but I was just on the orangutan flange episode
02:14:17 and it's really funny to hear a hopeful ben saying he won't add anything unnecessary to phantom's
02:14:21 revenge or and also releasing the cwc one or two lecture with it and also just truck
02:14:28 sink tricksy on actually riding rhodo rathcon chapter five the congrats on the public really
02:14:33 extended a lot of good here's my minimalist run where I actually beat it I didn't actually
02:14:37 didn't actually take me 10 minutes because I closed the tab after a break and then I proceeded
02:14:41 to drop in at the last 10 minutes of gib stream uh no I did take you 10 minutes um because that's
02:14:49 the time for the run I you're not the first person to say this and I feel like people don't
02:14:56 get that like the time is not the time you spent playing the whole game it's the time you spent
02:15:01 in the run it's always like that so no it definitely did take you 10 minutes uh don't
02:15:08 worry about it that's pretty fast though no one I haven't seen anyone try to speed run it
02:15:13 uh yeah I haven't seen anyone try to speed run pumpkin alley either
02:15:21 when the hot fix comes out I will explicitly ask for people to do that because
02:15:26 that there's there's a lot of like because it's a 3d game uh there's lots of like potential for
02:15:33 like time saving and and like skips I want to see what people can figure out I I did not add
02:15:42 anything unnecessary to phantom's revenge everything that ended up in there was 100
02:15:48 crucial for the experience um on a slime coin on a no you know no that not text texturally it's
02:15:59 texturally necessary it had the if it changes the it changes the uh the way you feel about it
02:16:07 uh yeah I guess uh no I'm just kidding obviously obviously you're right yeah slime coin is totally
02:16:12 slime coin is totally pointless floor reflections pretty much a waste of time they look nice but
02:16:18 they could have gotten away with they were nice I could have gotten away with adam and honestly
02:16:21 I probably should have but oh well whatever uh you know but not nothing unnecessary uh the um
02:16:30 um what else did he say uh about uh oh I was I think on a I think on a um on a
02:16:41 patreon podcast I will probably go into like stuff that I sort of thought about adding to
02:16:48 the game there was a bunch there's a whole I have a whole list of things that I was considering like
02:16:52 I would like to maybe add this to the game but then I was like no just just you have to stop
02:16:58 you see it has it has to stop somewhere there there were a few features that I was like
02:17:04 really considering uh uh I yeah also like before I really like got a lot of the game like nailed
02:17:13 down like when it was just a battle system with like nothing in it there was I was there was a
02:17:18 lot of like I was considering like a different sorts of like enemies and stuff I was I had like
02:17:25 different ideas about what it could have been uh I don't know there's a lot of things that could
02:17:30 have been but it is what it is and that's a tautology anyway the next one is there's no voicemail
02:17:37 there's just a link to a tweet from doid gazer oh yes yeah this is really good actually doid gazer
02:17:45 is um I haven't seen this I saw this on um yeah on twitter this is actually really good
02:17:54 the pcp iceberg okay or maybe it's or make you crew no it's the void it's like the it's supposed
02:17:59 to be like the void gazer is like Trixie the golden witch iceberg I think is what it's supposed to be
02:18:05 oh is it I think so well I feel like this is pcp stuff because like even at the top star fleet
02:18:14 weird utilitarianism has nothing to do with Trixie at all yeah yeah you're right
02:18:18 uh ask pcp I'm just could we use that hashtag I guess we did yeah for I for the um for when
02:18:27 we were doing questions instead of like voicemails yeah we did rebel pixels neuro typing that's all
02:18:34 this is all normal stuff yeah make survive tbap mining at night sigh wonderbred ripple xrp
02:18:42 group piss slash shit what's your favorite anime yeah one one one one uh riddle my ass
02:18:49 batman wears the podcast I'm gonna wait and I'm gonna go down until I find something I don't
02:18:54 even remember I actually I don't remember what's your favorite anime that was a question we got
02:19:00 like annoyingly like frequently because like people thought it was digipros anime podcast yeah well
02:19:07 and so there would be like again come up with better questions and that was like a thing we would
02:19:12 we would rag on I guess uh uh monkey kick uh what's that time Ben been recorded through speakers
02:19:25 what what does that mean you remember that uh I mean I know my mic used to be pretty bad
02:19:31 I don't remember Ben recorded do they mean that like do they mean like you were recorded
02:19:38 via someone else's speakers of your voice uh like so that's what it sounds like yeah I'm not sure
02:19:46 either uh let's keep going pizza jumps maddox synchronicities Ben and Jackie's college fun
02:19:57 that's that's a good one that now they now there's a piece of like lost media right there yeah
02:20:04 maddox maddox synchronicities is that's not do they just mean like like oh there was a breakup
02:20:11 and somebody's got to be the dick and somebody's got to be the maddox I think that is what they
02:20:14 like is that yeah yeah it doesn't really line up that's not really like a high profile thing
02:20:21 yeah like it's yeah it that's just like a hey is in some ways this one thing that happened was
02:20:27 resembled another thing in certain aspects like crazy um
02:20:35 has he groomed munchie now that now that one I'm familiar with give rights for doctor
02:20:44 Jesse okay I think I think this point when you get to the beluga whale that's when you just go from
02:20:49 like well I guess Tom is a vegetarian is is not true but like that we used to say that you know
02:20:56 we used to say Tom was a communist too uh that used that used to be a thing Thomas in one of the
02:21:01 the rumbles yeah yeah that was a way from way back give rights for dr who what is that in reference
02:21:10 to uh it's because you're just that I do writing stuff uh because you were a show you're a show
02:21:16 writer you do that I get do you do because you're writing stuff for a secret for a secret
02:21:23 project and still yeah so it's dr who because you're British oh well what else what else would
02:21:31 it be yeah um davoo is why davoo wasn't a red con three I don't remember that why wasn't davoo a red
02:21:38 con three I think she just didn't want to come I think it's as simple as that
02:21:46 or wait had she left by then the right con three no maybe um maybe a little are you sure I I you
02:21:58 know I don't remember I know I know at some point she hmm I feel like she was like the first person
02:22:10 to be like hey guys I've I'm officially like I'm like I'm actually leaving like I'm I'm officially
02:22:16 out and that might I feel like I feel like she was on a like a I need to reduce my presence on the
02:22:23 internet because I'm a game developer now people are gonna find my tweets like that was the thing
02:22:28 she was going on stupid and so she wanted to appear on podcast less and I maybe that was part of
02:22:34 like red con three not coming do you uh yeah I think you you know I don't really exactly remember
02:22:45 like if there was any particular reason or if there it was just like she was just like yeah
02:22:51 yeah um you know she deleted her she deleted her discord recently did you know about that
02:23:01 like she started discord no she had she put out like two videos started a discord and then deleted
02:23:08 it and said like oh this was like a youtuber discord yeah like like a like a davoo cord
02:23:17 to go along with like I remember it's it's very strange I remember she said she put out
02:23:24 she messaged me to say some shit about uh uh Trixie or whatever and then she said she said and
02:23:34 said she was considering like getting more back into like being online then she made a discord
02:23:43 and was like I want to be more online then like I want to be in like a community whatever
02:23:48 then she big mistake big big mistake and then she put out that uh five will goes west video uh
02:23:55 and then I think she did one more video after that I'm not sure like more like maybe like a week
02:24:01 ago or two weeks ago um which I missed at the time but it's there and then like a week ago she was
02:24:08 like yeah guys I've decided that uh this was like I was trying I was testing it out uh doing
02:24:13 community uh being online uh don't want to do it uh I'm deleting the discord by uh maybe I'll
02:24:20 like I'll keep making videos but no more community uh it's just stupid I don't know this is dumb um
02:24:31 yeah um anyway so in the in the lowest category then there's devu as a symbiote
02:24:41 does that is that like the the devu collective that joke
02:24:45 problem is something different you know it's probably
02:24:51 I mean none of these are none of these are real at this point these are all no but like I'm trying
02:24:57 because like I feel like the devu collective was a very well known joke in comparison to that some
02:25:03 of these other things I don't think yeah that's what makes me think it's not that I think it's
02:25:06 saying like devu is not a real human devu is actually like a like a creature that like like
02:25:13 you know maybe latched on to like a Trixie or something that was like a a parasite growing
02:25:18 in Trixie's body or something not a not a human I vaguely remember mage as a tulper I don't remember
02:25:26 in what context was she on an episode where we were talking about tulpers I don't think these
02:25:32 last ones are even like based in anything fiance blood ritual gamer saver and his xkgp
02:25:40 sounds pretty legit though I mean we don't we don't know how old he is
02:25:45 I guess not I guess not like exactly no
02:25:53 it's true then it's just true if we don't know so it's true yes so it's true if we don't
02:25:58 the fact if we don't know everything then like anything anything could be true
02:26:04 as far as as far as I'm concerned sorry I'm putting my bathrobe on because it's getting
02:26:08 chilly in here yeah okay uh so yeah this is uh this is great I love this it's pretty good
02:26:16 yeah it's really good a lot of a lot of a lot of funny jokes and references to things and uh

02:31:23 imo I haven't heard of that one uh there are some decent ones like for example the ash vampire
02:31:29 bionicle one no as well as vampires a piece of shit and his life studios russell grair one
02:31:36 the problem with most lectures though and the vast majority of lectures are
02:31:43 similar wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait did this did this idiot just recommend the void
02:31:48 gazers russell grair lecture the topics like aren't good for lectures is that what just happened
02:31:54 conducive to the lecture I wasn't listening like it's good final fantasy and this guy's serious this
02:31:59 guy thinks that the that the ash vampire bionicle lecture and the void gazers russell grair lecture
02:32:05 I watched like five minutes of that russell grair one and it was like incoherent and I didn't know
02:32:10 what he was talking about okay whatever there's like loads of them this guy this where this no

02:32:22 matter uh it's got to be something yes oh my god it's the same fucking thing it's the same
02:32:28 fucking thing he says oh it's better to just watch the thing you need something that you need
02:32:32 that you need a lecturer to explain it to you on I know I'm gonna feel I'm gonna feel really bad

02:34:09 uh whatever ring a ding ding I don't know it's just it's like it's just a video I see like hey I

02:34:29 oh once the lord of ghost things get get shipped off you said you would be able to play you said
02:34:34 you wouldn't play it until lord of ghosts I gotta admit I have felt like I've been missing out on
02:34:40 something by not playing elden ring everyone seems to just be having such a great time playing elden
02:34:46 ring yeah it's it's just like universally like that's a good one so I'm like I'm sure I'm gonna
02:34:54 have fun with it and I and I I would enjoy the process of streaming it and having everyone in chat
02:35:01 be a veteran of the game and being like no no no no no you gotta do this you gotta do that and I'd
02:35:05 be like huh what then I die that would be fun I want that to happen that does sound fun um okay the

02:37:11 and then we can see you back on next week guys okay there are a lot of people who would be mad that
02:37:17 you said the episodes are way too long people love that some people are like super long episodes
02:37:23 five hour episodes please yeah I get it I watched that I watched the entire uh
02:37:31 it's it saves somebody it saves somebody having to like click on another video
02:37:38 yeah why would you want to let it play just let it play I get it I genuinely get it next one is
02:37:43 called phantoms revenge three two one go so then his fans revenge you're taking revenge on tripsy
02:37:49 if not you should update the game to be that because that would be an even and more people will play
02:37:54 and fuck you fuck you you didn't play you didn't play the game if you didn't play the game you
02:37:59 don't know it is I can't tell this is a joke I mean I think he's just saying like ha ha revenge
02:38:07 is tricksy okay yeah you're right now and now I'm imagining like the same game but like the
02:38:13 sprites are replaced with phantom horn is just been saying it'd be terrible and and um the sonichus are
02:38:21 uh yigtralite so whatever you could call them I mean did didgy brony is in is in the game
02:38:31 now that is true oh like like didgy brony too it's it's uh it's
02:38:40 you I think you started to pick up on it you started to pick up and I don't know if you
02:38:46 uh picked up everything but there is um there is sort of a like sort of undiscussed
02:38:55 like story happening in the game with the son I mean uh some of them okay I'll just say
02:39:06 her name her name her name would be didgy bro her name her son even though she's a son of
02:39:11 her name would not be didgy bro sonichu it would just be didgy bro
02:39:16 and that's uh that's uh that's that's consistent that's consistent with all the other uh names in
02:39:23 the game the I wonder what that means uh you you got to that chamber and you were like huh does that
02:39:35 mean does that mean that some of these sonichus were ponies and I was like hey hey you saw some
02:39:43 other stuff before that you didn't notice but uh it was there so it was there all along
02:39:50 so like pony sonichus turned from ponies I mean I guess nightstar well I shouldn't say anything
02:39:57 about that but I mean well nightstar okay well nightstar is a sonichu right in the same way that
02:40:03 chris chan is a sonichu yeah they they just are for some reason I now that I think about it I have
02:40:11 no idea aside from like generating soldiers for a war which I guess is happening I have no idea what
02:40:17 that like thing the the facility is doing in ponyville in everfree forests specifically
02:40:25 I will say if you've seen in my second lecture in sonichu one or two when I'm talking about
02:40:32 which which issue is it issue 13 or issue 12 the one that's just like a big text dump of like
02:40:38 fucked up shit happening there's the part where there is the part in that issue where um sonichu's
02:40:48 blood like chris chan's blood gets like splattered over like I think it gets like it gets disseminated
02:40:57 through the water supply or it gets like like a wave of it or something something happens
02:41:01 chris chan's blood gets on all the nazis that are invading quickville and they all turn into
02:41:06 sonichu's uh and that's just canon that's just on then the sonichu race is filled with nazis
02:41:15 I think all those nazis died no no they no they go a lot of them die discord gives them a lot of
02:41:22 them heart attacks a lot of the remaining ones go back to germany and disband the rite
02:41:30 that's that's just canon that's just the text that's just the text um there's a
02:41:37 I feel like I need to reread sonichu but I don't want to let me let me let me think there are a
02:41:43 couple of sonichu's in phantom's revenge uh what are they blue yon blue yonder is one uh strawberry
02:41:52 shortcake I think I think that no not strawberry shortcake its name is like uh strawberry something
02:42:01 um strawberry cream I think it might be called strawberry cream and there's another one called
02:42:05 uh roaming service and there might be one or two others too but the a few of the sonichu's have some
02:42:11 like descriptions that might stand out a little bit uh I don't want to say I don't want to I've
02:42:19 said too much already uh anyway next voicemail is called uh prince isolation

02:51:44 glad you enjoyed the ending of uh of phantom's revenge hey you beat the game you got the ending
02:51:52 that's pretty good uh drawing the ending I didn't like it I found it very uncomfortable
02:51:59 to draw that scene but uh Gabe you told me that it was fine well I it's without getting
02:52:11 too specific yeah it's like it's uh it's like somewhat gory yeah a little bit it's not like
02:52:20 like actually unsettling at least for me in terms of like visuals obviously what's happening is
02:52:27 maybe a bit like it's not it's not about yeah it's not about uh it's not about like the I guess
02:52:34 you could I guess you could call it gore a little bit it's not like yeah yeah it's sort of that is
02:52:41 just a yeah uh it's just like uh it's like what it says about phantom horn is that what makes you
02:52:50 unsettled it's sort no not really no it was just like uh it's not that it says like oh it's that it's
02:53:03 bad it's like oh oh I don't know it's not that it's just that it's like a it's it's literally just like
02:53:12 if I was phantom in this situation this would feel terrible and and like that's it so I'm just like
02:53:23 I'm just feeling it I'm just feeling it drawing it when I feel it feeling it when I draw it and
02:53:28 when I look at it that's it uh yeah that's because I'm that's I'm what you call I'm what you call an
02:53:36 artist give oh really what's that try it sometime why don't you um next voicemail is called uh did I
02:53:46 upload it already yes I did st comics dot com slash patreon dot com slash ben saint dot com three two one go
02:53:59 to the round of phony veal there was a stranger one fine day it's the song
02:54:05 heart I spoke to folks around him didn't have too much to say oh my god
02:54:10 Jesus she was wanted and a killer his slime level ten and four and his slime court verified
02:54:17 cal count number one and 19 more one and 19 more Jesus was this guy trying his best
02:54:25 early in the morning when he rode into the town yeah I mean yeah exactly what he said
02:54:32 haha what sounds like this is canon no one dare to ask his business no one dare to make a slip
02:54:39 the stranger there among them had a big artist if they can't I can't believe it I can't believe it
02:54:48 no hold the stranger lived a pony who would the stranger come to me and she watched the stranger
02:54:56 marching down the cobble pony this is this is great in her bunker on the yaskers she came
02:55:04 I'll kill you I'll fucking kill you fuck it up the slimy stranger was marching towards his day
02:55:10 marching towards his day
02:55:15 base that I like I like that being the canon voice of red man in that sequence
02:55:21 yeah that's what makes it funny this was uh I don't know LA is our post the somebody's got to
02:55:28 do it like a pcp animated event I did there's this there's a four panel sequence of red man
02:55:38 in the red man in the classic red man comic poses he's singing that song that was uh that was really
02:55:45 something okay next wait a minute okay okay the next one all right now I'm unsure because the next
02:55:57 one is called please don't play the previous one too late it's too late okay I assume that the other
02:56:06 one was the all right maybe this is the one that um maybe this is the one that uh crezathore meant
02:56:13 not to play and I told him I wouldn't play it but like that was good I already played it and like
02:56:19 it's kind I mean I have mixed feelings about it no no I love it I love it okay I think it's fine
02:56:27 yeah it's fine don't worry about it um next one is called uh uh god I lost my place next one is called
02:56:35 david hater come collector um oh wait I haven't posted yet David hater come collector there it is
02:56:44 okay three two one go so you wanted better voicemails to riff on here you go give then
02:56:52 possibly cheesy as a comic artist to a comic artist which platforms would you recommend for
02:56:57 upload they're all terrible also how much your sites cost you and how hard to maintain their
02:57:02 framework is um they're all all platforms are bad they're all terrible if there's one they're like
02:57:10 I don't know I guess line webtoon is okay it's probably the one most people use I don't know
02:57:16 yeah webtoons all right the I don't feel like they're necessarily good for all types of comic
02:57:23 you have to be like the right kind to get big noticed on there um yeah when it comes to my
02:57:31 website it's like a wordpress thing and I pay for the domain and since it's not like dot com it's
02:57:39 just dot site it's like cheaper if I got it through hover which is you may have heard of that it's
02:57:47 like a like a domain registering thing yeah it's quite easy to use my website I got through I think
02:57:55 it's called digital ocean uh I pay like 10 I pay like $10 a month just to keep my like domain active
02:58:04 uh which is like whatever um I pay like eight pounds a year on give and take dot site
02:58:15 wait do I pay $10 a month $10 a month seems like a lot but I guess I don't know
02:58:20 hmm I know for my other website um it's like 11 pounds for a dotco.uk for a site that I made
02:58:30 for uni that I don't use for anything I think maybe I just decided that I just wanted that dot com
02:58:39 really bad do with the coom it does it does seem high now that I think about it
02:58:49 I mean dot com I don't know the the legality thing I assume that like you're not allowed to sell
02:58:56 things if it's not a dot com like you can't set you can't have a website if it's not dot com
02:59:02 because it's commercial but I don't know whether that's actually enforced or whether that's true
02:59:06 there's no way that that's like enforced I'll I'll have to look into that because like I was
02:59:12 thinking like maybe I should make give and take dot com or something as well I just think it's more
02:59:17 expensive I don't know I just think it's yeah I mean I don't think it really matters uh it honestly
02:59:25 I probably should have just gone for dot st comics dot dot slime all right well I mean that would be
02:59:33 sick um there's lots of things you could do it's just like um I guess the cool ones are really
02:59:40 expensive and the ones that everybody knows to type in are the most expensive like dot com
02:59:47 or like dot gov if you're like no those are those are very expensive um all right next one is
02:59:55 what's that squeaking noise in the last episode uh answer I don't know I don't know what you're
03:00:01 referring to yeah I don't know was there a squeaking noise I don't remember one uh next one is uh
03:00:09 come collector two sons of liberty three two one go speaking of metal gear did you play
03:00:17 who is best but raid nor snake I played the first one and I didn't finish it and that's it I played
03:00:25 the first one for a few minutes by the first one I mean solid solid yeah metal go solid yeah
03:00:32 I didn't get very far and I was kind of confused and it was too hard I think I got to like the
03:00:38 like the second elevator sequence I did I never beat it I got like pretty far I knew it and I
03:00:45 never beat it I have like the short game I didn't yeah it's I had never played the whole thing
03:00:52 but I it wouldn't be that difficult to just go through it I think with games like that that
03:00:59 and like Resident Evil the fact that there are like oh um uh you can't there's like things that you
03:01:09 can't get back or like rations and stuff healing things or saving points or stuff it's all like um
03:01:16 what's the word finite you run out yeah that scares me too much fun fungible uh so so like
03:01:26 when it comes to that I don't know the full length of the game I get scared and I get too
03:01:30 afraid to use healing things and that means I die a lot and then it's too hard I because I feel
03:01:36 like I need to save those healing things because the game might what if I get to write the end of
03:01:40 the game and then I can't win because I didn't have any like healing things like uh like stacked up
03:01:48 and so that's why I don't play games you definitely you definitely shouldn't use those items that the
03:01:54 developers put in the game to like let you beat it you should definitely avoid those at all costs
03:02:02 it's like it's a holdover for me and the time that you shouldn't use them the most is when you
03:02:07 need them like that's when you that's when you know like no this is a trap this is a trap they've
03:02:12 laid for me it's just a holdover from like when I was younger and I didn't know like the extent
03:02:19 to which games could exist I thought like the possibilities were so far reaching and like
03:02:24 anything could happen that I need to be super prepared for every eventuality because one time
03:02:30 I got a game over and I didn't like it like you obviously you want your heroes and your JRPG like
03:02:37 after they beat the final boss you want them to like end the game with lots of stuff in their
03:02:41 inventory lots of like grenades and like vaccines and stuff like you know they're gonna need to like
03:02:47 sell that later you know to get their life started afterwards to get their retirement fund
03:02:51 exactly exactly yeah I could throw this grenade and deal some extra damage but like you know that's
03:02:57 gonna be like the starter capital to like you know start my bakery after I settle down start a family
03:03:02 later camp why would I like oh this this rocket launcher only has three shots if I use one that's
03:03:11 a third of my ammunition gun who knows if I'll get another ammunition box further in I better
03:03:16 use my pistol instead save save on the rockets and then fight this boss for 200 hours that's right
03:03:24 that's that's thinking now you're thinking uh what was the question what was the topic
03:03:33 it was your favorite metal gear oh um I don't know I I haven't played much of them um I have like
03:03:43 the HD collection that includes two three and uh snake eater I think and I also have
03:03:53 metal gear four I think three is snake eater three yeah three snake eater yeah no wait no yeah three
03:04:00 there's another one there's like a PSP one that's on in the collection oh um uh peace walker
03:04:07 peace walker yeah um one of those uh those are all possible my brothers play those
03:04:15 um they've beaten I think they've beaten like all of them actually I've sort of watched some
03:04:22 some bits of like metal gear solid four I was like oh that's the one where the they have the thing in it
03:04:30 that's the way I'm worried is our old man I don't know much about them I should play them
03:04:35 because I have them why not uh I just I just have the sense in my head that like metal gear is
03:04:42 like the hardest game ever made and you have to be a genius to be able to beat such a video game
03:04:48 why why would you why would you because when I was because I was when I was younger I had
03:04:53 trouble with metal gear solid one I was like okay well I guess I'll never beat this one
03:04:58 and that just that opinion carried through to everything else well I can't play metal gear
03:05:03 solid two uh before beating metal gear solid one and metal gear solid one's impossible so
03:05:07 they're probably all impossible I'm I'm a little baby child and metal gear solid is a video game for
03:05:14 grown-up big boys and I'm and I'm not a grown-up big boy yeah I mean I look at something like crash
03:05:22 bandicoot and I'm like well that's I'm supposed to be able to play that that's a kid's game it's
03:05:26 called goofy it's stupid yeah yeah yeah to play metal gear solid it's like it's like technical
03:05:31 you gotta like you gotta know how to like use a rocket launcher and like you gotta be able to
03:05:35 use your camera to look at things and be smart and I'm like yeah I don't want to do that I want to
03:05:39 go jump jump spin you know I don't know I don't know how radar works what am I uh what am I an
03:05:45 engineer what am I a science guy no no thanks just leave me with my with my with my mascot
03:05:53 platformers with my scrimblow bimblows please yeah scrimblow blimblows only scrimblow bimblows only
03:06:03 you should add that as a you should add that as a race in endless war

03:11:48 I have no idea I'm not watching the video well okay 20 what don't put youtube video if you got
03:11:55 one us to watch a youtube video later it better be five seconds in the voicemail yeah um next
03:12:04 next voicemail is mage of light three two one go the thing about vosh is that he kept saying that
03:12:14 he's okay with people criticizing the misogyny but whenever someone criticizes the misogyny he keeps
03:12:20 saying that this is sitting ground to jk rallying yeah like well are you okay with being criticized
03:12:27 also like I know this is like it bullshit but if a lot of people have told you that what you did
03:12:35 was wrong and that they don't feel right about it maybe you should just like hear them instead of
03:12:42 being antagonistic towards them like what happened with contra was so fucking stupid and it's
03:12:47 literally like how about just saying hey sorry that's it that was all the thing but he is such
03:12:56 a baby yeah like fucking apologize dude that's it yeah I really think there's no I really think
03:13:03 there's no basis for him to just double down like the thing to do is be like like it's like it's
03:13:11 bad that it's bad that I said that and that like jk used it to like make me look bad and make all
03:13:17 of us look bad and it was embarrassing you like it's not it's not the wrong thing to do is be like
03:13:23 no it was good actually uh yeah I mean I watched his video explaining it and he doesn't he he he
03:13:32 doubled down he doesn't agree that like um it's good for jk rolling but he does agree that it was
03:13:42 misogynistic okay so I'm like okay well whatever so that's bad right yeah like we're all agreed that
03:13:49 that's bad then like yeah the that part of it okay um he thinks he still has an argument I guess it's
03:13:57 like there's an argument there I can't remember exactly what he said um hey it's just such a who
03:14:03 cares like drama fest at the moment I don't like it well it's like man getting all heated about it
03:14:10 all all I can say is like man I got I got some uh just just for like mention for mentioning it on
03:14:17 Twitter I got some I got some bros I got some bros showing up in my dm or not in my replies
03:14:25 and oh my god they're so annoying like yeah like like angry vosh people are like
03:14:34 they're not they're not quite as bad as smaller people but they're they're on the same level
03:14:38 because they'll show up they'll show up and like you can just I can just smell it I can just smell
03:14:45 it through them they think they're gonna show up and they're gonna own me with fax and logic that's
03:14:49 really what they're here to do they show up and they start asking questions they show up and they
03:14:53 just and they start asking questions that are obviously meant for me to answer them in a way
03:14:58 that will like lay a trap that they can catch me in like I that's obviously what they think they're
03:15:03 gonna do to me uh and it's just it's just infuriating I hate them um and uh yeah uh so next one is okay
03:15:15 we got another one from mage of light three two one go also before I forget I mean it's kind of
03:15:26 ironic that man is so angry at vosh because he constantly is doing the ironic misogyny thing or
03:15:35 maybe not ironic who knows I don't think that's true man you're you're so fucking hypocritical
03:15:41 when when was the last time I did that you just name name name an instance that I did that
03:15:49 I don't know what they're saying you're doing ironic misogyny I don't know even if I did I mean
03:15:55 the difference would be well I didn't I didn't get JK Rowling retweeting me saying something like that
03:16:01 and saying like this is this is what men do to me all the time and like I'll never back down from
03:16:08 this sort of bullying right the point is JK Rowling didn't like make it a make it a you know a a a
03:16:16 point in the culture war that's that's the difference even if you're right which I'm not sure if you're
03:16:20 right about that anyway next one is called you know fuck you fuck you it's not hypocritical
03:16:34 it's not hypocritical because it's it's a different situation like a like a like you can you can be
03:16:44 upset that the the the state of affairs is that JK Rowling uh screenshoted something
03:16:52 um the not necessarily like like vosh didn't know that would happen it's I don't think it's
03:16:58 probably a bad thing because he's such a public figure to have done in the first place but then
03:17:02 it's like I don't think vosh is a bad person for being like ha ha women bad like as a joke
03:17:11 like I don't think that makes him a bad person what I do think kind of is is pushing him into
03:17:16 like oh he's sort of just like a bad guy now territory is that when people say
03:17:22 well you know that you know it's bad that misogyny is bad he he doubles down and goes no
03:17:29 it's it's good and here's why no that's what that's what I saw his video that's like uh uh
03:17:36 you know like like the moral necessity of being misogynistic to JK Rowling or whatever
03:17:42 like I didn't watch the video no of course I didn't watch the videos I just saw what
03:17:45 there I just saw what they're called and I saw what he's saying on twitter right I mean that's
03:17:50 entirely the problem is that his is uh he milked he decided to milk the the discourse with a really
03:18:00 inflammatory thumbnail and title of course like the content of the video is obviously a lot less
03:18:06 well not obviously apparently but like it was a lot less actually inflammatory he acknowledges
03:18:11 the misogyny you know it's yeah and it's just like there's more nuance but like nobody who's angry at
03:18:17 vosh would like go to the efforts to like listen to what he's has to say and I don't think I should
03:18:23 have and it's like I'm not gonna I'm not gonna listen to his three hour stream because then it's
03:18:29 a 20 minute clip but if I don't want to listen even that's too much uh I don't want I'm not
03:18:34 gonna turn into one of these vosh people they're terrible uh the message the message that it's
03:18:40 putting out okay it's it's it's a little bit bullshit it's a little bit bullshit for for you to
03:18:47 like okay you title you title your video something that clearly implies one thing and then in the
03:18:56 video maybe you you put in there a little secret thing you put in there like oh well actually
03:19:02 I don't know I don't actually think what it's not it's not it's not my fault it's not my fault
03:19:08 that the message I take from that is that you think the thing you titled your video because
03:19:13 you were deliberately deceptive about it uh so yeah I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure that when he has
03:19:18 20 minutes to like talk about it I'm sure it comes across as much more nuanced than the title of the
03:19:24 video but I don't feel like uh I've made an error or anything by taking away from that the message
03:19:31 that is like he's doubling down on misogyny it's yeah it's it's it's a fair like assessment I guess
03:19:39 all right it's just um and I absolutely will not seed ground and I absolutely will not seed
03:19:46 ground and given to the bullying of the vosh freaks who just want to be like did you watch the stream
03:19:51 did you watch the stream here I'll link you a video watch this video yeah I won't like it's
03:19:57 I think it's what was annoying me about it most is like you know people are misunderstanding things
03:20:05 from both sides and like information is getting like not fully understood and people are like
03:20:13 living their lives and this is just sort of a blip and it's like you know twitter like
03:20:19 what is your opinion on this thing and like nobody is should be expected to go on an expedition
03:20:25 before they can give their opinion yeah um but I wish they either did that or just didn't give
03:20:32 the opinion if they don't know what is happening exactly I feel like it's it's too normal it's
03:20:38 too normal to be expected to say your piece on something before you understand it and that's
03:20:47 why a lot of shit happens and it's completely unimportant yeah well uh I guess I understand
03:20:58 what you're saying but uh I don't know I just really I just really don't like I just really
03:21:05 don't like the messaging that's coming out from like the vosh camp I really don't like I really
03:21:11 don't like it at all it's it's stupid yeah um anyway fuck you mage of light I'm not a hypocrite
03:21:20 uh I won't uh just let you uh say that shit to me it's not true uh next one is uh insubstantial
03:21:29 update to Texas anti trans oh great I can't wait to have this I can't wait to receive an
03:21:36 insubstantial update on the situation uh three two one go so earlier in the week I left a voicemail
03:21:43 about uh the anti trans stuff going on in Texas and the update is we don't really know what's
03:21:48 going on they're still appealing stuff that's that's what I said Texas DFS was asked if they're
03:21:52 still doing the investigations into families of trans kids and they gave like a non-answer so
03:21:57 who knows in funnier news ken paxton tweeted an obvious cancel bait tweet about how Rachel
03:22:03 Levine is a man and then uh the twitter made an exception to not delete his tweet but just flag
03:22:09 it as offensive because he's a public official but they he still went on and made another tweet
03:22:14 decrying big tech censorship about it anyway and is tweeting more like obvious cancel bait and it's
03:22:20 really hilariously transparent what he's doing is Rachel Levine that swimmer who I've been seeing
03:22:25 on twitter lately for the one who won a thing I don't know there's like a very tall trans woman
03:22:33 swimmer who like Charlie Kirk or someone was like tweeting about you know oh drag out the
03:22:41 trans women in women's sports thing the only time we care the only time we care about women's sports
03:22:50 is when we can use it as a wedge issue yeah against the people we don't like okay uh
03:22:58 so yeah I guess we don't know whether they're doing as I thought the bad stuff as I thought
03:23:05 well I hope they don't do the bad stuff I hope uh I was I was I remember seeing that like there was
03:23:12 a judge you know ruling an unconstitutional and I remember I remember being relieved like okay
03:23:17 I'm glad this isn't just just going unchallenged I heard Joe Biden say something about it as well
03:23:23 I feel like oh yeah Biden was pro Biden's auntie but the Biden administration is like this is bad
03:23:29 so that's pretty yeah but like are you gonna do anything about it Joe you know that's fair
03:23:34 what are you gonna do huh where are your thoughts and prayers thoughts and prayers from the from
03:23:39 the Biden administration uh they said um they released a press oh it was like um
03:23:49 the like the national sorry I don't remember exactly what agency but some national agency
03:23:55 released a press uh release that was like you know our you know the the national agency you know
03:24:02 offers like uh you know support you know you know in spite of like you know the like state uh
03:24:08 like if if any family feels they've been discriminated against on the basis of like
03:24:12 you know race sex a sexual orientation gender identity you know our agency you know we can
03:24:21 you file a complaint with us and we will you know help with that or something so it's good
03:24:27 it's good this is cool I guess uh anyway it's a developing situation um next one is called
03:24:39 tournament arcs three two one go
03:24:46 in episode 300 you talked about how lazy tournament arcs are and I can't agree more I can't believe
03:24:53 that Ben zane fruit one into the champion you're wrong you're wrong there's not an there's not a
03:25:00 tournament arc in the champion that just takes merely a tournament there is merely a tournament
03:25:05 but like story is not really about that uh story is not really anything because it's just like the
03:25:10 intro chapter like a tournament arc is a very specific sort of you have all of these characters
03:25:17 in a a story that involves a lot of special types of magic fighting powers and stuff you
03:25:24 put them up against people and to see who wins and it's just a long uh series of fights but like
03:25:34 the context for the fights is like a competition whereas usually it's like we're trying to do
03:25:42 something and save the world or stop someone bad I that's why it would be lazy is because it's like
03:25:49 what if we just got rid of the story from this battle manga and just had battles instead
03:25:55 yeah but that's not I mean you know I mean a good it's not it's not a bad good tournament arc
03:26:00 you know has a story going on it's yeah sure sure but like like the laziest way to do it is for
03:26:08 whatever story is going on to be put on hold while we punch each other for a bit right it's been
03:26:14 done badly before yeah uh um I'll get man I'll get I'll get back to the champion when I know
03:26:25 what it is that I want to say with it and also when I get over the feeling that in my gut
03:26:32 that I am too ashamed and embarrassed of myself to say anything ever uh one day
03:26:42 what do you mean like like the the the moral of the champion yeah you don't want to actually come
03:26:47 out and say anything about it it's not that it's that I it's that I don't it's that I don't really
03:26:52 know what the uh the real champion was the friends we made along the way I feel I feel like I could
03:27:00 ending I feel like I could say something I could I could have a message in there there's a kind
03:27:07 there's a couple different ones I could have and like I just I would just have to settle on like
03:27:11 here's what I want the message to be and here's exactly how I'm going to go about saying it and
03:27:16 I don't know exactly what that is yet uh so it's going to be it's going to be an allegory it's going
03:27:21 to be capitalism is bad for capitalism it's going to be an allegory for youtubeing and and
03:27:26 and and uh Sophia is a youtuber she's burnt out that's what she doesn't like making her youtube
03:27:32 videos that get slay queen and everyone loves them it's about being an only fans uh sex worker and
03:27:39 how uh it's it's a real job actually it's real work it's an allegory and then all the people
03:27:47 say I want to be just like you and it's like yeah it sucks exactly everybody everybody wants to be
03:27:54 an only fans girl or guy uh anyway okay we're almost done by the way you've got like two more
03:28:04 okay I think yeah yeah the next one is an image oh the procrastinators podcast is a show where a
03:28:13 bunch of content creators pick a topic and talk about it so no one cares anymore and we take
03:28:17 viewer questions on twitter where is this yeah what is this from is this like on the youtube page
03:28:26 I don't know what the lines are no the the youtube channel description just says like under construction
03:28:33 is this from the website is it um let's check I'm just thinking like what what has these like
03:28:41 like very faint gray lines behind on the white background uh backdrop I don't know
03:28:51 what is our is our podcast the is our website the pro crap yeah the procrastinators podcast
03:28:55 dot com uh is there an about section it's a true mystery I don't know this is inside the animus
03:29:05 an assassins creed yeah I have no idea where where this I have no idea where this copy comes from
03:29:13 um all right whatever it'll be it'll be a mystery forever um okay and then fittingly our last
03:29:21 voicemail of the day is called wait yeah it's called a one last message three two one go
03:29:32 hello comrades nicole here calling my god vulgar heaven he yeah he's giving me a chance to send
03:29:40 you one last message the nicole I would like to say he loves you very much and you'd like to
03:29:46 say goodbye nicole I go back to vulgar heaven where you can drink vulgar forever yeah goodbye
03:29:52 comrades it was good knowing you see you nicole uh why you gotta give him a why you gotta give him
03:30:00 a heartfelt send off like that oh gee I'll miss him I didn't know I didn't know how much I'd miss him
03:30:08 till he was gone nicole even just in the in the duration of this this uh episode yeah I've gone
03:30:19 from ambivalence he's gone tragedy he had a family did he yeah his brother his brother
03:30:31 let us know he was dead oh right yes uh all right well that's a lot I didn't see this
03:30:39 his brother it was his brother that's the end of the voicemails which is probably just about the
03:30:46 end of the podcast yeah uh go check out the pumpkin alley the new hot-fixed version see if you can
03:30:57 find all the lizards including the new one will that be out by the time this is out um it yeah
03:31:03 okay pretty pretty pretty sure it will be um the only thing we're waiting on is like feedback to see
03:31:11 whether something works on a mac version and if it does then we just set it live because it's already
03:31:15 uploaded hey what did you make a pumpkin alien what did what did you make pumpkin alien uh unity
03:31:23 in unity okay uh you know I was talking to crack and like I I want to get phantom's revenge going on
03:31:33 I wanted to run an html so I can put it on new grounds and I probably want to like maybe convert
03:31:39 to a bunch of platforms and I just I was thinking maybe I could maybe pay someone like on five or
03:31:46 something to do that because I don't want to do it um and I and crack said he would look at it and he
03:31:51 might be able to just do it and he told me that like oh actually he can't because um he uses linux
03:31:58 and like game maker studio just doesn't run on linux like even in in wine like it just doesn't
03:32:04 run you can you can make a game project for linux but you can't run the program that there's no
03:32:11 version of the program that runs on linux which seems insane uh linux is so odd it feels like it
03:32:19 only has drawbacks I mean I don't really uh the people that like it really like it but I don't know
03:32:28 why exactly from what I from what I gather is like it's a version of windows or whatever
03:32:34 that has stripped away unnecessary background um processes uh that like slow down the machine
03:32:44 and that don't literally need to be there um and so you as a user can customize the experience of
03:32:53 your computing experience you know your computing experience is perfectly customizable
03:32:57 and there's no like a windows update is forcing you to do something and it won't let you not do it
03:33:03 like well linux does not have that and that's like I think is the appeal is the total control over
03:33:09 your computing uh time yeah but I'm like it's like it's like the opposite direction to apple where
03:33:17 there's so much less control than you have over windows where you can you can see all the program
03:33:24 files and stuff and yeah in a mac that's possible but it's like it's harder like it there's just
03:33:29 super easy like consumer friendly apple product windows for like everyone this just is useful
03:33:37 and then linux for the nerds is what I understand indeed yeah it's for computer it's for people that
03:33:45 like know the enthusiasts and look that with a computer which I don't really know on that level
03:33:51 what I'm doing yeah uh so anyway uh I do I do really want to get it running on html and uh
03:34:00 and put it on new grounds at some point uh I just uh I just want to do it just want to do it it might
03:34:07 be mm-hmm I had I had started converting I had started converting it but it was
03:34:14 turning out to be a little bit of work and I gave up I'm like I just can I just pay someone
03:34:19 like 50 bucks to do this for me uh yeah I wonder if you could put 3d games on uh new grounds uh
03:34:28 I mean and I don't see why not like in theory it would have to be uh it would browse a version
03:34:35 rather than just a game file that you can run and executable it'd have to literally work in
03:34:41 browser so probably not I mean I I made um like the champion game runs in browser that one runs
03:34:48 html it's not a downloadable executable downloadable yeah but it's like a two-dimensional game and it's
03:34:53 not like a million things going yeah yeah but like there's nothing um there's nothing about
03:35:01 it's like you know 2d-ness I don't I don't see why a 3d game wouldn't work in html um well I know
03:35:11 3d games that do work in html I just I guess I just don't know enough I feel like the pumpkin alley
03:35:16 demo has a little too much to process for like the browser to handle it hmm I don't know how it
03:35:23 works though I maybe it just defaults to the computer handling it instead of the browser but
03:35:28 then how's it be on the browser wow I don't run away from snakes did work in browser but it took
03:35:36 a really long time to load and that's a much smaller game right yeah um I got no idea but uh
03:35:52 but I just really want I just really want fandoms revenge on newgrounds I want on every
03:35:56 platform I think I'm definitely gonna try and put it on steam at some point just because
03:36:02 I might I might change the music I might have to change the music because I stole the music from
03:36:09 front mission gun hazard you know how it goes what are you gonna do they're gonna make music for it
03:36:18 I I was talking to Nate about it the other day actually when we were talking about finance stuff
03:36:25 he seemed to think that the thing to do was just to commission like sound to like music which
03:36:32 yeah I could do that it seems like so unnecessary but like I guess if it makes the difference and it
03:36:39 makes it's so like it's so like bankrupt it's like creatively bankrupt like hey hey musician could you
03:36:46 like make me a song that like basically sounds exactly like this other song like it's it's different
03:36:51 but like just make it sound like this other song okay okay bye uh like how like how sad you know
03:37:00 um but that's all like like I but I you know like uh the game is it has like events in it that are
03:37:07 very specifically timed to like the timing of the music like I really I sort of made the scene
03:37:13 sort of around the music that is in them sometimes so there's really no way around it if I if I wanted
03:37:20 new music in there so I don't know I guess so yeah I could do that or I could just upload it with
03:37:25 the music intact and like just be like Square Enix will never notice because it's like from an old
03:37:30 game that nobody cares about and like that's true I don't know I don't know what I'll do about that
03:37:38 but I know that I want it on there just just to say yeah it's on steam Lamal
03:37:45 okay uh what do you think are we done I think we're done I think we're done yeah okay uh
