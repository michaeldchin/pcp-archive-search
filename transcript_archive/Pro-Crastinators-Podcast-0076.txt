00:00:00 If you don't stand with your fellow Canadians, then you are a rat!
00:00:02 Don't call me a rat, buddy!
00:00:04 I'm not your buddy, friend.
00:00:06 He's not your friend, guy.
00:00:07 I'm not your guy, buddy.
00:00:09 He's not your buddy, friend.
00:00:10 I'm not your friend!
00:00:11 Hello!
00:00:13 Everybody, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:17 The only show on the internet about friends.
00:00:20 I am the best guy ever, and we're joined today by Mumkey Jones.
00:00:24 Oh, look at Donkey Go!
00:00:28 That's funny.
00:00:32 We've got Ben Saint here.
00:00:35 Yeah, the PCP, the only show produced by friends, for friends, and only for friends.
00:00:43 If you're not our friend, get out of here.
00:00:47 If you're not on the Patreon, you're literally a worthless friend.
00:00:50 Oh, wait, Mumkey's calling you out.
00:00:53 Mumkey's calling you out, listener.
00:00:56 That's true.
00:00:56 We've also got the DeVoo with us.
00:00:58 Hey, everybody.
00:00:59 I saw those pictures you posted on Facebook of you guys hanging out.
00:01:02 I guess I didn't get the invite, I guess.
00:01:05 Oh, no.
00:01:05 Oh, shit.
00:01:07 DeVoo wasn't supposed to know.
00:01:10 And at her glorious return, it's going to be a real frenesance, everybody.
00:01:16 Lethal Aurora Mage is back with us.
00:01:18 Holy shit, here I am, guys.
00:01:20 We're just delighted to have you with us once again.
00:01:23 Yeah, I'm happy to return.
00:01:25 Beautiful.
00:01:25 So let's do the thing that we're doing and let's clarify what the PCP is real quick.
00:01:29 It's a YouTube podcast where a bunch of friends from the internet,
00:01:34 who all are content creators, get together and just talk about a bunch of bullshit.
00:01:37 Any clarifications?
00:01:38 It's also a pyramid scheme, as of very recently.
00:01:42 A hashtag PCP Pyramid Scheme, everybody.
00:01:47 All right, well, today's topic, everybody, is friends.
00:01:50 Worthless friends, specifically.
00:01:52 Those worthless fucking pieces of shit.
00:01:55 Okay, we'll get into the exact definition.
00:01:56 But first, okay, so there's no worthless friends on Urban Dictionary, if you can believe that.
00:02:01 But let's just see what a friend is and we'll go from there.
00:02:04 Nobody knows about friendship better than the people of Urban Dictionary.
00:02:09 That's very true.
00:02:10 Okay, here we go.
00:02:11 Here's the top definition for friends.
00:02:13 People who are aware of how retarded you are and still managed to be seen in public with you.
00:02:18 People who make you laugh till you pee your pants.
00:02:20 People who cry for you once your special items disappear
00:02:24 when you don't have enough money to get an ice cream they chip in
00:02:27 knows all your internet passwords who would never make you cry just to be mean.
00:02:32 I think I have a lot of friends that would fit this perfectly.
00:02:34 What a terrible definition.
00:02:36 If not making me cry just to be mean, it qualifies you as a friend.
00:02:40 Then I think I have an awful lot of friends.
00:02:44 That's true.
00:02:45 Does anybody actually trust their friends with their internet password?
00:02:48 That's like a recipe for disaster.
00:02:50 You know what I remember when I think about that?
00:02:53 You know that scene at the beginning of Full Metal Jacket
00:02:57 where the Sergeant guy calls out a private fat body or whatever his name was, Gomer Pyle.
00:03:03 He's like, there's nothing in this world I hate more than an unlocked footlocker.
00:03:08 If it wasn't for worthless pieces of shit like you, there'd be no thievery in this world.
00:03:12 He's making the larger point there that sometimes it's best not to trust everybody
00:03:17 because everybody's better off that way.
00:03:18 So I'm totally with you.
00:03:19 You shouldn't share all your personal details
00:03:21 even with your closest friends because people don't want to know that shit
00:03:24 and it causes temptation.
00:03:25 You can fuck you over in the long term.
00:03:26 Well, the problem is they do want to know it
00:03:28 so that they can fuck me over by posting I'm gay lol on Facebook.
00:03:32 So that's why you don't want to give them the password.
00:03:33 Was that any different from a usual Facebook post for Monkey?
00:03:36 Like, I don't even...
00:03:39 It's been posted so many times they wouldn't know if I got hacked or not.
00:03:42 You guys use Facebook?
00:03:43 You're such normies.
00:03:45 My Facebook actually got hacked this morning
00:03:47 and my college friends were messaging me being like,
00:03:50 dude, thanks for notifying me about that 90% off sale of sunglasses.
00:03:53 But please keep that to your...
00:03:55 And how ironic is it that it's sunglasses?
00:03:57 Knowing that it's me.
00:03:58 Fucking perfect.
00:03:59 But in any case...
00:04:01 So, okay, we're talking about worthless freks.
00:04:03 Nate, don't pretend you're not taking a little handout under the table
00:04:07 from some unscrupulous foreign bootleg sunglasses corporation.
00:04:11 They supply you and that's how you get your fix.
00:04:14 They keep me in the green with these sunglasses.
00:04:19 Keep me out of the red.
00:04:20 Okay, so let's...
00:04:22 I think we all probably got a different idea of what a worthless friend really is.
00:04:26 I'm sure it'll be around the same...
00:04:27 Same general theme, but...
00:04:29 So who's had some experience with a friend who turned out to just be of no value
00:04:33 to you or anyone else on this earth?
00:04:35 Oh, buddy.
00:04:36 I've got a wacky cavalcade of lovable characters to introduce you all to today.
00:04:41 I have two.
00:04:42 Ooh.
00:04:43 Two.
00:04:43 Well, I think...
00:04:44 I think since Mage is a lady and she's also back after a long summer,
00:04:47 I think we should let her go first.
00:04:49 No.
00:04:49 Agreed.
00:04:50 Don't.
00:04:52 Okay, never mind.
00:04:53 Okay, let's get somebody else to give one and then we'll maybe go back.
00:04:57 Well, we've all heard the tale of Momke's great friend in high school
00:05:00 who fucked his girlfriend and also slashed his sister.
00:05:04 So that's pretty worthless friend, somebody who betrays your trust like that.
00:05:10 Well, hang on, hang on.
00:05:11 There is a right way to fuck your friend's girlfriend and to fuck your friend's sister.
00:05:14 I'm just saying, you know, context matters in these situations, but okay.
00:05:18 Sure.
00:05:18 Yeah, context the fucking his own sister and...
00:05:21 Yeah, of course.
00:05:22 Yeah, great story.
00:05:23 I think I've read that anime before.
00:05:25 But I mean, the thing is though with me is I think my greatest weakness is that I might be too forgiving
00:05:32 because despite how worthless and terrible these friends are and all the bad things they've done to me,
00:05:39 like they don't even fucking say sorry, but I'm just like,
00:05:42 Yeah, well, I guess live and let live, you know.
00:05:43 I think there's a difference between boys and girls is that girls like really hold grudges long term
00:05:49 and the guys are just like, uh, fuck it.
00:05:50 Let's go drink a beer.
00:05:52 So hold on.
00:05:52 So your biggest flaw is that you're too forgiving.
00:05:54 I think I read about that on like page 17 of Humblebrag Compendium 2018.
00:05:59 Oh, that's not a brag.
00:06:01 Is being forgiving something to brag about, DeVoo?
00:06:03 In Jesus fucking did it.
00:06:04 It's a sign of weakness.
00:06:06 It's like quite literally mess-ionic.
00:06:09 In today's, in today's feminized society, I suppose it is a virtue.
00:06:12 I suppose it is.
00:06:13 I think being too forgiving is a sign of weakness.
00:06:15 I think it's a, it's a humble deficit, not a humble brag because it only leads to more pain.
00:06:21 Like, oh, I guess I'll let you walk all over me and treat me like shit all the time.
00:06:24 But the thing is, I don't have any other fucking friends.
00:06:26 So what am I supposed to do about it?
00:06:27 I have no choice but to forgive them for all these terrible things they've done.
00:06:31 But, uh, you know, that's just the one example.
00:06:33 I'll get into one so you guys haven't heard before later on.
00:06:36 Okay, uh, mage, can you give us one of your two?
00:06:41 Okay, but I'm leaving the last one for last because this is super long.
00:06:45 Okay, okay.
00:06:46 So like, um, there was this guy, we go way back.
00:06:50 I think I met him when I was eight at first and like, we have a quite a history, but
00:06:54 like to summarize it, like at first he was like absolutely terrible.
00:06:58 Disgusting.
00:06:59 To summarize it, he raped me.
00:07:01 He was, he was, he was the, he was the brother of my best friend.
00:07:04 So we, he had to be there, I guess, but whenever we went to hang out.
00:07:08 Was he an older, an older guy?
00:07:09 Yeah, by one year.
00:07:10 So he was, yeah.
00:07:11 So he's around.
00:07:12 So, so at first, like we really disliked him, but then like, uh, started to really
00:07:16 get along with him that at one point he became the best friend rather than my best
00:07:20 friend, that'll come up later in the second story, by the way, um, or should do
00:07:25 if I don't forget foreshadowing.
00:07:28 But yeah, so, and then, uh, we were like really, really good friends and stuff.
00:07:32 And he went to, um, study in America for a year as, uh, not an exchange program,
00:07:38 but like he won the privilege of studying in America for a year and was really cool.
00:07:43 And we, um, kept in touch and he actually sent me a manga, like the death note first
00:07:49 volume manga for Christmas as well, because he knew I was really into death note at
00:07:54 that time.
00:07:54 So it was like, it was wonderful.
00:07:56 We were good friends, but then he, he returned and when he returned, he was, he
00:07:59 kind of got set back a year in school because in America, they were learning a
00:08:04 different curriculum than we were learning.
00:08:06 Sure.
00:08:06 Sure.
00:08:07 So he ended up in my class and I was like, we can sit together during the classes
00:08:12 we are going to have together and like we can hang out and stuff.
00:08:16 It'll be like great.
00:08:17 But then he never did.
00:08:19 And then he kind of started shunning me and it's just like he, he got like too
00:08:25 cool for me or something.
00:08:26 Like because, because I think the thing is like he was always sort of, he had that
00:08:29 American, he had that, he was, he was an American.
00:08:32 No, the, my theory is because he was always sort of like the nerd in his previous
00:08:36 class.
00:08:37 He didn't really have much friends, but, um, then he came back and he was like,
00:08:43 he started getting along with the other people a lot.
00:08:46 And it was like, we were teens at that point.
00:08:48 I think 16 or 17 and you know, everyone kept hanging out and drinking and stuff.
00:08:53 And I'm not about that.
00:08:55 And like we were, we went to like the super special class called like the
00:08:59 baccalaureate program.
00:09:01 So like all the smart kids quote unquote went there.
00:09:04 Right.
00:09:04 And I got in there because I was very good at English.
00:09:07 That's the only reason I got in there.
00:09:09 Um, I suck at everything else other than English class.
00:09:12 So, you know, I wasn't the most popular kid, especially since I was like into
00:09:15 anime and stuff.
00:09:16 So I was like the weird kid.
00:09:17 So I, I was not popular.
00:09:20 So I think he sort of like traded me off for popularity.
00:09:23 And I was like, you know, I, he's been a loser kind of his whole life.
00:09:28 I'm going to let him have this one.
00:09:30 So, you know, mage, that's a, that's an excellent point.
00:09:32 I also want to add to the point that it is a big propagandized myth that nerds
00:09:37 are like actually good people or nice people like the shitest meme of all.
00:09:42 I hate it so much.
00:09:43 Every time you see like the scrappy loser kids, honestly, it's like, it's like an
00:09:46 it, the, the, like all the kids who were like the outcast were like the best
00:09:49 people and everyone else was literally an evil monster.
00:09:52 All the bullies were like fucking, you know, evil freaks, but the loser kids
00:09:56 only hang out with each other because they can't do any better.
00:09:59 That's why they hang out.
00:10:00 And the second you give them a drop of something beyond that, they'll
00:10:03 seize it and they'll betray you at every turn.
00:10:05 You can't trust a nerd as far as you can throw, particularly with the whole
00:10:08 like, oh, he's going to be better to a girl stereotype.
00:10:11 It's like, there is going to be a, they're taking the beta path to get the
00:10:15 pus.
00:10:16 Right, right.
00:10:16 That's what they're doing.
00:10:17 You're going to, you're going to be able to perceive a above average
00:10:21 level of giving a shit because of the desperation.
00:10:25 If they get it, the desperation goes away and then they haven't had the
00:10:29 experience of trial and error and how to treat a woman gentlemanly that a
00:10:32 fucking Chad would have by it.
00:10:34 And I know this game cause I played it for many, many years.
00:10:37 That was my ankle in life.
00:10:40 Oh, I need to go back.
00:10:44 I'm not shitting on them at all.
00:10:45 They're smart.
00:10:45 They're, they know what they're doing.
00:10:46 You know what it makes me think of?
00:10:48 It makes me think of Griffith from Berserk and how, and how
00:10:51 he was, you know, he was, well, you know, I won't not, no need to go into the
00:10:58 details, but you know, once, once he, once he got like, once he had all the
00:11:01 power and once he, once he could do whatever he wanted with no consequences,
00:11:05 he showed his true colors and you know, what's interesting about that, Berserk
00:11:09 really is the story of a friendship and how like, yeah, like, I guess even the
00:11:16 whole thing with Charlotte and like, when he was pursuing, you know, marrying
00:11:19 the princess and becoming king and getting his kingdom and all that, he
00:11:22 never really like, betrayed guts in any serious way until he, you know, like the
00:11:27 eclipse happened.
00:11:28 And like, obviously that's, you know, that pretty much sums up his feelings
00:11:31 right there.
00:11:31 Like these people were his tools, but Berserk, he was nice to them and treated
00:11:36 them well because he needed them.
00:11:38 That's right.
00:11:39 That's right.
00:11:39 And it's a complicated thing, but yes, it is very interesting.
00:11:42 I think that Griffith did show himself at the very least, not a true friend to
00:11:46 those individuals.
00:11:47 No kidding.
00:11:49 Yes, that's my, uh, that's, that's my deep, that's my deep analysis of that
00:11:55 situation.
00:11:58 Yes.
00:11:58 I'm just like, those guys are okay.
00:12:02 Those people, if they were, if they were like hot 10 out of 10s, you know,
00:12:05 they'd be banging cosplay sluts that wouldn't be hanging out and making this
00:12:08 commercial for Sakura con, like a bunch of bullshit.
00:12:10 That's their angle, man.
00:12:11 That's their angle in life to hang around Vic Minyana, make these terrible
00:12:15 commercials and go to soccer God every year.
00:12:20 My one, the one ambition.
00:12:22 Um, okay.
00:12:22 Let's, let's move on to another one.
00:12:24 Ben, do you have a story for us?
00:12:25 Um, worthless friend of yours.
00:12:27 I remember one that involves you actually.
00:12:29 Wait, give me a hint because I'm thinking of one.
00:12:32 I just, I remember a vague story about when you used to ride the bus with a
00:12:36 kid and he, you seem to be really have fun with him.
00:12:38 But then when the other people were around, he would, he would be mean.
00:12:42 He'd be mean.
00:12:43 He proved that he didn't actually like you.
00:12:45 I, you know, I actually don't remember that story.
00:12:48 I think you might be thinking of someone else.
00:12:50 No, the, the guy, okay.
00:12:52 So I have a guy, he, I don't think he's not worthless.
00:12:57 Like I actually like him in a lot of ways and like I'd still consider him a
00:13:00 friend, but he did prove to be troublesome.
00:13:04 Like not just to me, but to other people.
00:13:06 This was like God, like maybe a year and a half ago before I moved in with
00:13:11 Digi, I was living, I was living in this place in Medford, which is near
00:13:16 Boston.
00:13:16 It was called Monkey House.
00:13:18 And Monk, yeah, we call it Monk.
00:13:20 We were, we were this, yeah, we were this, we were six, six little Monkeys
00:13:23 living in a house and jumping on the bed.
00:13:26 We, we, it won't tell off and call the doctor and the doctor said, no more
00:13:29 Monkeys.
00:13:29 Oh yeah, I've been there.
00:13:30 Actually, I think, I think like to, like the first day at Monkey House, we all
00:13:34 like jumped on a bed together, you know, to seal a rhyme, teach you nothing.
00:13:42 Oh God, we didn't, yeah, we really didn't think that went through, did we?
00:13:46 But, uh,
00:13:47 You could have bonked your head on the floor, dude.
00:13:49 So, so Monkey House was a collaborative effort.
00:13:53 Basically, there was, we knew, we knew this guy.
00:13:56 I'll just say his name.
00:13:57 His name, his name is, uh,
00:13:59 Say his first name.
00:14:00 Vic Mannyana.
00:14:00 I'll hide his name.
00:14:01 Let's say his name's Carl.
00:14:04 Um, so Carl, uh, like he had, he was friends with me and another guy locally.
00:14:09 And then he had a couple of other friends from like these internet forums that
00:14:13 they hung out on and talked about and like it came to pass.
00:14:17 Well, see when I first knew Carl, I thought he was like a real ironic
00:14:21 hipster kind of guy and he'd make all these funny like, ha ha.
00:14:24 Um, um, you know, sure, I'm suspicious of the Jews.
00:14:27 Ha ha.
00:14:28 You know, not, not necessarily criticizing Middle Eastern genocide or anything.
00:14:32 I'm just saying maybe there are good reasons for it, stuff like that.
00:14:36 I thought it was a joke.
00:14:37 It turned out not really, not entirely.
00:14:40 And a bunch of, so a bunch of the, these other guys that he brought in and literally
00:14:45 the experience I had with Paul, I really thought he had the exact same arc.
00:14:49 I feel like Paul was like genetically engineered out of like one of his hair,
00:14:52 lots of hair that created pull out of that guy.
00:14:56 I don't, I don't mean to, I don't mean to diminish this guy or like throw
00:14:59 his, all of everything he thinks under a blanket statement and like make sweeping
00:15:04 generalizations because I talked to him a lot and he had a lot of knowledge and
00:15:07 he had a lot of really complicated opinions that were not just simply, oh,
00:15:10 I hate Muslims or whatever.
00:15:12 But you know, he was a little, him and his friends prove to be, if not alt right,
00:15:16 maybe kind of alt right adjacent.
00:15:18 So, so that was troubling.
00:15:20 So alt tab right.
00:15:21 Yeah.
00:15:22 Um, but I got something bad to tell you, bed.
00:15:26 Well, so bad news, but that wasn't, but that wasn't really the problem.
00:15:30 The problem was that like to get all these guys together, like he basically
00:15:35 just said like, I have a house, I have a bunch of people moving in.
00:15:38 Do you want to split the rent?
00:15:39 And I was like, sure.
00:15:40 And I moved in.
00:15:40 But like after we'd been there for months, it came out and I hadn't realized
00:15:44 this, that Carl had like, Carl had really like fucked the other guys over
00:15:49 because he had told them that the house was there and we had it and we had like
00:15:54 made the down payment only for them to like fly here from across the country
00:15:59 and arrive to find that the payment had not been made and that he needed more
00:16:03 money from them immediately on the spot.
00:16:06 Like, yeah, to pay the down payment on the place to pay first month's rent
00:16:10 or else there'd be no place that they could live.
00:16:12 So they basically had no choice but to lend him money right then and there
00:16:16 or they'd be homeless, uh, which they did.
00:16:19 And then for months, he kept telling them like, oh, I'm going to pay you back.
00:16:24 I'm going to pay you back.
00:16:25 But he didn't work like his, his dad owned a little print shop and his dad
00:16:29 would have let him work in the shop to make money anytime he wanted.
00:16:32 But he frequently didn't.
00:16:33 He would just kind of sit around, say he was doing things when he wasn't.
00:16:37 Um, he would, the final.
00:16:40 Oh, I remember this guy now.
00:16:41 The final fucking straw came when we were like, Carl, this month we cannot
00:16:47 be laid on rent again because we'll be kicked out.
00:16:50 Like, do we'll just, just, just level with us.
00:16:53 Will you have it?
00:16:55 Yes.
00:16:56 Like days before Carl.
00:16:57 Okay.
00:16:58 We're serious.
00:16:58 Like we really need it on the day.
00:17:00 Just, just be straight with us.
00:17:01 We're not going to be mad.
00:17:02 Are you going to have the money on time?
00:17:04 Yes.
00:17:05 And of course the day comes and goes and no, he doesn't have it.
00:17:09 And we're all like, shit, we've got to cover his part.
00:17:11 So we fucking me and some of the other guys went up and who grabbed
00:17:15 all his stuff and gathered it together and put it in the living room.
00:17:17 And he came home that day.
00:17:18 And, and, um, one, this other guy, Matt was like, Carl, Carl walks in
00:17:23 the door and Matt's just like, Carl, welcome home.
00:17:25 Now get the fuck out of here.
00:17:28 And we just turned him around and sent him away.
00:17:31 Um, and it was sad, um, but he richly deserved it.
00:17:34 I think that is sad.
00:17:36 I think that's the exact kind of worthless friend story I was hoping to hear.
00:17:39 That's exactly right.
00:17:40 He, um, yeah, he, he, he, he dragged his feet about paying those guys back.
00:17:45 I think that later he eventually did.
00:17:47 Um, I don't know how, but I think benevolent of him.
00:17:50 Yeah.
00:17:51 I think it came like after much conversation with everyone involved.
00:17:56 My theory was that he was hoping to just get himself in so much debt
00:18:01 and like fuck him, his own situation to such an extent that it would be
00:18:05 so hopeless that some like rich guy that they knew on these forums
00:18:09 that they hung out with would just like throw him a bone and be like,
00:18:12 here, I'll cover your debts for you.
00:18:14 Um, but it didn't happen.
00:18:15 Interesting strategy.
00:18:16 Yeah.
00:18:16 Um, but it didn't happen.
00:18:17 You forgot to be a hot girl portion of that.
00:18:19 Yeah.
00:18:21 You were like, yeah, I think this guy had gotten, I think the guy had like
00:18:25 had like spotted him before.
00:18:26 Like I think he'd this was, yeah.
00:18:29 Carl is the kind of guy who kind of gets by on pity a lot of the time
00:18:34 and will like spin a sad story to get people to like give him stuff
00:18:38 and to like forgive transgressions and forgive deaths and things.
00:18:42 That's just no way to run your life.
00:18:43 You know, it's just no way to run your life.
00:18:45 My question is, why does he have to actually go into debt?
00:18:48 Why can't he just tell the guy online?
00:18:49 Hey, I'm in debt.
00:18:50 Get the, give me the money.
00:18:52 You know, um, I don't know.
00:18:54 Maybe he probably just fucking lie.
00:18:56 It's the internet.
00:18:57 But I guess I don't think he's lying.
00:18:59 Well, maybe I'm thinking maybe because the other guys would be able
00:19:03 to corroborate the story.
00:19:05 Like, yeah, Carl owes me all this money and he can't pay it back.
00:19:08 So more importantly, his conscious mind will be able to corroborate the story.
00:19:12 Like, you know, there's a big difference between like people who lie
00:19:15 and they know they're lying versus the guy that you're describing then.
00:19:19 If you know what I mean, like it seems like a person who lies to
00:19:22 themselves enough that they can sufficiently mental gymnast their way
00:19:25 up to the top of the trapeze, but they can't ascend outside of the entire
00:19:29 fucking circus into the heavens just on mental gymnastics alone.
00:19:33 They just, they just can't break that glass ceiling to get beyond to the,
00:19:36 to the freedom above.
00:19:38 I, I want to say that like this guy never fucked me personally over
00:19:42 like that.
00:19:43 So I don't have any like personal beef with him and like I do like him
00:19:47 and think he's pretty fun to hang out with and he's, he's, he's not worth
00:19:51 always are.
00:19:52 Yeah, but he really did, but he really did, he really did fuck these guys
00:19:56 over in the, under the guise of friendship and it really sucked.
00:20:01 No one, no one is truly worthless, but, but we're here to make sweeping
00:20:05 generalizations about people's character that we know.
00:20:07 So it's understood.
00:20:08 It's understood.
00:20:09 Yeah.
00:20:09 So yeah, that's, that's the tale of Carl.
00:20:12 I have a short one actually.
00:20:13 I realized I actually have two stories.
00:20:15 Okay.
00:20:15 So I actually, I actually don't have any that are actually my friends.
00:20:18 I just have two ones that I experienced adjacently through someone else.
00:20:21 Right.
00:20:22 I have no tolerance for shitty people.
00:20:24 I, I like for me, the definition of liking someone is that they like me.
00:20:29 Uh, that's not, you can't just get me to like you by liking me, but that's
00:20:32 like 80% of it to be completely honest.
00:20:34 Like if you like me, then you're probably the kind of person I want to
00:20:37 hang out with.
00:20:38 If you don't like me, if you don't value me, I don't value you for the most
00:20:41 part, but you like me to do.
00:20:42 How do you explain that?
00:20:43 Hello.
00:20:44 Well, got him.
00:20:46 Oh, I like you to do.
00:20:48 Yeah.
00:20:49 Let's fuck.
00:20:51 So anyway, okay.
00:20:52 So what would you want?
00:20:53 So this one is from childhood, right?
00:20:55 This is my brother.
00:20:56 You know, my brother's a more sociable person.
00:20:58 He's a, he's very much that, um, he's, he's sort of a, uh, chivalrous, uh, outdoorsman
00:21:03 kind of guy or at least he was.
00:21:04 Now the Dora tipper of the highest.
00:21:06 No, well, no, he's never, he used to be into like, you know, tennis and BB guns.
00:21:11 Like the entire bird population of our yard was eliminated within us, within a
00:21:14 summer, which is great.
00:21:15 There was no more poop anywhere.
00:21:17 And now he's into like fucking actually now he's into ballet, which is really
00:21:20 cool because he's the only guy sick.
00:21:22 He's the only guy.
00:21:23 So was I when I was a kid?
00:21:24 Yeah.
00:21:24 Yeah.
00:21:24 He's just having guns to ballet.
00:21:26 It seems like two completely.
00:21:28 Yeah.
00:21:28 You watch, you watch a little anime called princess to hell.
00:21:31 Hell yeah.
00:21:31 You do the pendulum.
00:21:32 The pendulum always swings in the other direction.
00:21:34 Yeah.
00:21:35 Well, it's like the fucking heterosexualist thing you could ever do because
00:21:38 he just goes around grabbing the shit out of girls and touching them.
00:21:41 And that's right.
00:21:42 He's like, yeah, it's pretty cool.
00:21:43 He even got like, so actually he's doing ballet class.
00:21:45 He's like in the class.
00:21:46 It's like this fucking like don't it's like this fucking Christian thing though,
00:21:50 which makes it a lot less dope.
00:21:51 No, but you know, I don't know how he's because like he got into it because our
00:21:55 youngest sister has been into dance since she was like four.
00:21:58 And I guess my brother was just like, I guess I'll try it too.
00:22:00 And now that he's the only guy, let alone like a six foot really strong guy.
00:22:04 He got sent like to a trip to Israel because they were going to do some like
00:22:09 performances there for like a whole month.
00:22:11 And they're like, well, we need someone to pick them up for the whole picky upie
00:22:14 parts of the ballet.
00:22:15 So he got to go to Israel for it.
00:22:16 And he gave me, he came back with a freaking wallet with a really badly done
00:22:20 rendition of the Pink Floyd album with the light coming out of the other side
00:22:24 as the rainbow.
00:22:24 It's really shittling.
00:22:25 Yeah, Dark Side of the Moon.
00:22:26 Yeah, Dark Side of the Moon.
00:22:27 Now it's my wallet.
00:22:27 Anyway, that's the kind of man this is, right?
00:22:29 So he's the kind of man who will trust you even if I don't know if it's
00:22:32 necessarily worth it.
00:22:33 So we were kids and he was like 11.
00:22:35 My brother's name is Aaron.
00:22:37 This kid's name, I think his name was Josh.
00:22:38 I don't remember.
00:22:39 And he was just a kind of like charming attractive manipulator kind of guy who
00:22:43 would just keep fucking you over and keep lying to you, you know, the stakes
00:22:48 weren't that high because we're all 11 here.
00:22:51 But you know, you know how it is.
00:22:53 And the thing that was, yeah, his whole upbringing is, you know, single mom fucking
00:22:57 will do drugs, someone gets shot or whatever.
00:22:59 We didn't live in a great neighborhood.
00:23:01 We lived a few streets away from where, you know, there was like literally a tree
00:23:04 growing into someone's wall and they never fixed it for some reason.
00:23:07 That part of neighborhood is where Josh was from.
00:23:10 And the thing that was really notable to me, I remember specifically
00:23:13 he fucked over my brother seven times.
00:23:15 I specifically counted the number of times he lied to him and like Aaron, how
00:23:20 long are you going to keep trusting him?
00:23:21 But the most notable thing Aaron's Aaron's got to forgive him until he fucks
00:23:25 him over 70 times, seven times.
00:23:27 Yeah.
00:23:28 Yeah.
00:23:28 And like, and the weirdest thing is that Josh had so many mannerisms that reminded
00:23:34 me not to get political, but reminded me of Bill Clinton like astonishingly.
00:23:39 He had like the same smile, the same demeanor, despite being like,
00:23:42 he fucked a lot of secretaries.
00:23:44 Probably has by now.
00:23:45 He's Sonic the Hedgehog.
00:23:47 Oh, he's probably, oh, he's probably a snap and get a pussy kind of guy at this
00:23:50 point, I imagine.
00:23:51 Right.
00:23:52 Okay.
00:23:52 I believe he went to Julia.
00:23:53 He looks down.
00:23:53 He just looks down his penis.
00:23:54 He snaps.
00:23:55 He's got a pussy.
00:23:56 Oh, yeah.
00:23:56 He's really excellent.
00:23:57 He's like, you know, really charming and attractive and skinny and like got that
00:24:01 like boyish charm.
00:24:02 Is his wife un-electable?
00:24:04 Yes.
00:24:06 So yeah.
00:24:07 Well, that doesn't sound like Bill Clinton at all.
00:24:08 It was just a really interesting thing to me at the time because I was probably
00:24:11 like 13 or 14 or whatever, you know, and like, so I kind of like knew what Bill
00:24:15 Clinton was, you know, I'm not that fucking young.
00:24:17 And yeah, I guess that's really all there is to say about that.
00:24:21 So.
00:24:22 So wait, what were the seven ways that he's fucked?
00:24:24 I don't remember.
00:24:25 It was all a bunch of dumb, you know, preteen bullshit, but it wasn't anything
00:24:29 too big, just like, I actually don't remember at all.
00:24:32 So I'm not even trying.
00:24:33 Okay.
00:24:34 All right.
00:24:34 We throw this man out of the bus.
00:24:36 Fuck that guy.
00:24:38 I condemn him to death.
00:24:39 Oh, I remembered one short one as well.
00:24:43 Oh, actually, but before you say it, I just want to say that, you know, Josh, I never
00:24:48 thought that it'd be so simple, but I found a way.
00:24:50 I found a way.
00:24:51 Oh, there it is.
00:24:54 It's going to take you time to realize.
00:24:56 But if you realize that actually I found out over your shoulder, you're not real
00:25:02 find out.
00:25:02 I'm always picking you up when you're down.
00:25:06 I was, I was really glad to see your brother.
00:25:10 I was really happy.
00:25:11 Your brother, Aaron Drake, Davoo finally made up with Josh recently.
00:25:15 That's my last name.
00:25:17 The is my first name.
00:25:18 It is.
00:25:18 It is for this joke.
00:25:19 Baby boy.
00:25:21 Okay.
00:25:22 I'm sorry.
00:25:22 All right.
00:25:22 Mage, what do you got for us?
00:25:23 Yeah, it'll be just quick, much like the nerd in the last story.
00:25:28 I don't dislike her at the current state.
00:25:31 It just so happens the way it happened.
00:25:33 Like she, um, we met also when I was very little, even younger than eight.
00:25:38 I think it was a five or six.
00:25:40 Um, and we, we were friends for almost a decade, I think.
00:25:44 And, um, she, maybe the last, uh, she, she kind of was a bit of a liar, but
00:25:49 she didn't do it on, I'd like to see on purpose, but like, I mean, you know,
00:25:54 when you're lying, but it's like, you know, little kids being little kids and
00:25:58 she just wanted to impress.
00:25:59 So she would sometimes make up lies.
00:26:02 And so I can't really hold it against her.
00:26:04 But the thing about her though, um, she would sometimes make really stupid
00:26:07 decisions in her life.
00:26:09 And every time she would come to me and be like, Hey, I want to do this thing
00:26:12 or Hey, I'm going to do this thing.
00:26:14 I would be like, no, that sounds like a bad idea.
00:26:17 You're going to regret this.
00:26:19 And she never listened to me and she got in trouble and then she would come
00:26:23 back to me and be like, I should have listened to you and it would repeat
00:26:28 for many, many years for many, many occasions.
00:26:30 She never listened to me despite, you know, admitting that post fact she
00:26:35 had, she should have listened to me.
00:26:37 The very last thing she didn't listen to me.
00:26:39 A new girl sort of moved in into the neighborhood.
00:26:42 We were sort of neighbors in the same neighborhood.
00:26:45 And I could tell she was trouble.
00:26:47 She was the kind of like, you know, preppy long haired, uh, a bit of a
00:26:51 skanky sort of girl.
00:26:53 And my kind of girl.
00:26:56 I think the words right out of my fucking mouth.
00:26:59 14 at the time.
00:27:01 I Oh, that's really my kind of girl.
00:27:02 Oh, we go.
00:27:04 Skanky 13 year old.
00:27:06 Can I move to what Lithuania?
00:27:08 Where the fuck do you live?
00:27:10 But basically she moved in and she, she was very much like a drama whore.
00:27:15 I think like we've never dealt with the sort of person, but I knew she was
00:27:20 troubled in the moment.
00:27:21 I met her.
00:27:21 I did give her a chance, but just from interacting with her, I knew that,
00:27:24 you know, she's going to lead people down the wrong path.
00:27:28 And, um, my friend sort of got friends with her and I was like, don't
00:27:32 become good friends with her.
00:27:34 She's like, you know, stay cautious, please be mindful because, you
00:27:37 know, she's probably going to get you into like alcohol and smoking and
00:27:41 maybe even drugs.
00:27:41 Who knows?
00:27:42 Like I knew, I knew she was going to be like that because we were living in
00:27:46 a not the best neighborhood.
00:27:48 Let me tell you, uh, a lot, lots of drug people.
00:27:53 Like surprisingly, I kept hearing stories about people using drugs and
00:27:57 like other stuff, like all these spooky stories in our neighborhood.
00:28:00 And I never met any person that actually did that.
00:28:04 I was like, where are these stories come from?
00:28:07 Cause they, cause they, cause they knew that you were beaten up boys with
00:28:10 your Dragon Ball Z moves and they knew to stay away from them.
00:28:13 Did I tell you that story?
00:28:14 Uh, should I not have said that?
00:28:18 Was that told?
00:28:19 No, I'm just, I'm just surprised.
00:28:21 I was beating the people with Dragon Ball Z moves.
00:28:25 Yeah.
00:28:26 Okay.
00:28:26 Are we talking like spirit bomb or like, or like, punch or punching?
00:28:31 We punched each other and it was, it was, that's how we played.
00:28:35 Like when I was little, our games was like, we would punch each other
00:28:38 until it would hurt and that was fun.
00:28:43 But we were playing Dragon Ball Z.
00:28:44 So it was okay.
00:28:45 So is this, is this person, someone who never really became a close friend,
00:28:49 but was like a fake friend or was just a friend of low caliber?
00:28:53 She was like quite a close friend to her.
00:28:56 I was her best.
00:28:57 And sometimes on some occasions, even the only friend she had.
00:29:01 Okay.
00:29:01 So we were really, really close friends.
00:29:03 And yeah, I told her not to get close to her because I knew she
00:29:05 was going to be trouble.
00:29:06 And the same like the nerd guy, you know, she exchanged me for that girl
00:29:12 and we never talked again.
00:29:14 Just kind of like, trade it up.
00:29:15 Yeah.
00:29:15 Trade it up.
00:29:18 Can't, can't say I heard stories about her and not very good ones
00:29:23 about how she, when like she, she, she, the thing is though, like,
00:29:28 I don't want to like, you know, stereotype or whatever, but this is
00:29:31 a story that was quite common in, in Lithuania at that time, considering
00:29:36 the time we lived in, like a lot of broken families and stuff like that.
00:29:42 She, she, she came from a very poor and a broken family and her chances
00:29:47 of like, you know, getting a good life were pretty low in comparison.
00:29:53 And, but everything changed upon the election of Donald Trump.
00:29:59 But yeah, but yeah, she, and yeah, so like, I really, I really wanted
00:30:04 to try and, you know, leave her on, on, on the good path and just, just
00:30:07 like to, to give her a chance to like, not, not fall down.
00:30:10 This is the same rabbit hole her mom fell down as it seemed the history
00:30:16 repeated herself with her.
00:30:18 So I'm sad.
00:30:20 I did, I did the basic, you know, if she doesn't want to be your fault made.
00:30:25 Yeah.
00:30:25 She didn't want to be my friend anymore and she wanted to hang up with
00:30:28 the skanky girl.
00:30:29 So, you know, yeah, for me, it's like, if there's any person
00:30:31 who I'm getting into some sort of affiliation with and I recognize
00:30:35 some major problem and the only, the only way I'm going to have
00:30:38 a long-term affiliation with them is if that problem is rectified or
00:30:41 addressed, this individual has the social equivalent of a five second
00:30:46 span to prove that they are self-aware, self-deprecating about
00:30:50 that issue and are willing on some level to deal with that problem.
00:30:54 And if they do not demonstrate that self-awareness, that, that courage
00:30:58 of the self to challenge themselves, then I'm like, all right, bye.
00:31:02 You know, like I have a very short, very short patience for people
00:31:05 who are not willing to address themselves and a pretty long patience
00:31:10 for people who are like people who will like regularly with absolute
00:31:14 genuineness say sorry and they don't do the same thing a second time.
00:31:18 Like they're really showing a, a, a statistical improvement chart,
00:31:22 you know.
00:31:23 Oh, I just remembered this friend also got me into some pretty deep
00:31:26 shit, but that's a story for another podcast, I guess.
00:31:29 Oh, okay.
00:31:31 If you say so.
00:31:31 Yeah.
00:31:32 For those of you who cast.
00:31:35 I have a story.
00:31:37 This one is actually about, it's about me being a shitty friend.
00:31:40 It's about me being the worthless friend.
00:31:41 The plot twist.
00:31:43 Wait, is that going to be the subject?
00:31:44 Cause I mean, I, that kind of needs its own episode with just me for
00:31:47 about seven hours.
00:31:48 I mean, well, that's fine.
00:31:49 I, I really only have this one story because I really don't have
00:31:52 any experience of a friend, uh, proving to be shitty or worthless.
00:31:56 I've got some that are like minor things.
00:31:57 Like they just started being boring.
00:31:59 So I didn't.
00:32:00 Hey, I'm sure you've got some minor things.
00:32:01 Hell yeah, Nate.
00:32:02 High taste boys.
00:32:03 We got, we're very fucking selective.
00:32:06 That's how, that's how it should be done.
00:32:07 I discard what is worthless to me, which is everyone I've ever known.
00:32:11 Yeah, basically.
00:32:12 And you all will be too in time.
00:32:13 I look forward to it immensely.
00:32:15 But let me tell you about the time where I was a terrible friend.
00:32:18 Um, so, yeah, this is basically worthless, I suppose.
00:32:21 So, um, a friend of mine got married two years ago.
00:32:25 And maybe I've told the story before, but I don't think I have on here.
00:32:28 So two years ago, a friend of mine got married.
00:32:30 So I fly back to Massachusetts for the wedding.
00:32:32 I haven't been there in a while.
00:32:34 And, uh, so I'm at the wedding.
00:32:36 It's a good time.
00:32:37 All my old friends are there from school.
00:32:38 It's, it's absolutely fantastic.
00:32:40 Um, and I, uh, my, my one friend brings a date and this date is like,
00:32:47 I've seen her several times before when we've been hanging out.
00:32:49 They'd known each other for a while and she, uh, was clearly friend zoning
00:32:54 this guy really hard, really hard.
00:32:56 And, uh, she, man, she just turned it on for me, man.
00:32:59 What can I say?
00:33:00 She just turned on all the signals, uh, the, the, the touch and the extended
00:33:04 eye contact, laughing at jokes that I was not even attempting to make.
00:33:07 And what could I do?
00:33:09 Uh, you know, what can a man do in this kind of situation?
00:33:14 So, uh, the extent of it was we, we kissed at the wedding for a while.
00:33:18 Uh, yeah, I, I, I, and I don't want to glorify this.
00:33:21 This was a very bad thing I was doing.
00:33:23 I was simply, this is an excuse, but I had not gotten late in quite a while.
00:33:27 So I was just like, finally, finally an opportunity presents 22 years.
00:33:30 Here we go.
00:33:32 No, no, uh, more recent than that.
00:33:34 But anyway, um, yeah.
00:33:36 So what can I say, man?
00:33:37 I just, I just made out with my friend's date.
00:33:39 Uh, they had, like they were not dating.
00:33:42 I was, I was in my drunken way.
00:33:43 I was like asking her like, so are you guys like an item?
00:33:46 Like, is this okay?
00:33:46 What are we doing right now?
00:33:47 She was like, oh yeah, it's fine.
00:33:49 Don't worry about it.
00:33:50 Don't worry about it.
00:33:51 Little did I know, uh, this was, I mean, certainly not in his mind.
00:33:55 You know, I just, my judgment was way fucked up.
00:33:56 I totally was a bad person, uh, regret it deeply.
00:34:00 I don't think you did anything wrong.
00:34:01 I mean, that woman is her own being.
00:34:03 If she's not into that guy and she's into you, like, why would you, like, he'd
00:34:07 be fucking you over if you weren't allowed to make out with that hot shit?
00:34:09 You know what?
00:34:10 I am perfectly willing to say that from a, from a basically like moral
00:34:14 standpoint, like no, no contract has really been violated in this situation,
00:34:18 but simply from the perspective of like being 100, as cool as possible to
00:34:23 your friend, this was not 100% cool to my friend, you know?
00:34:27 So on, on that scale, you know, since we're talking about friendship specifically,
00:34:31 this is not the best way to maintain a friendship, you know?
00:34:34 No, probably not.
00:34:35 Probably a pretty poor way to do that.
00:34:37 Exactly, exactly.
00:34:39 And, uh, I regret it deeply.
00:34:40 If you're listening to this friend, I apologize sincerely.
00:34:43 I regret it all the time.
00:34:45 He's, he's definitely not listening, but in any case, I am very sorry.
00:34:49 I will not do it again.
00:34:50 I've learned my lesson.
00:34:52 That's it.
00:34:52 That's, that's, that's all I got.
00:34:53 Really?
00:34:53 That's all I got.
00:34:54 Well, I'm going to have to one up all of you because I've got the most worthless
00:34:57 friend of all time and you guys are going to, your jobs are going to drop.
00:35:00 Hope you guys are ready.
00:35:01 Hope you're all sitting down because this story is going to
00:35:04 revolutionize the PCB podcast as we know it.
00:35:07 Fuck yeah.
00:35:07 Not too long ago, I had a decently good friend of mine and we decided, you know
00:35:11 what, we're going to start a podcast together.
00:35:13 That'd be real good.
00:35:15 And, uh, you know, let's try to do this consistently.
00:35:17 Let's, let's work together.
00:35:18 No.
00:35:21 And, uh, you know, we decided the podcast would be reviewing each Naruto panel
00:35:25 one at a time.
00:35:27 Oh, that's a good idea.
00:35:28 That's a good idea for a show.
00:35:30 We thought it was a good one.
00:35:30 We thought it was a good one.
00:35:32 Yeah.
00:35:32 So we did the first one.
00:35:33 It's a huge shit, probably the most popular channel on video on that channel
00:35:37 at the time, but then the friend just like disappeared.
00:35:40 She like disappeared like to some fucking Middle Eastern, uh, European
00:35:44 country with like no microphone.
00:35:46 And I didn't hear from her for like three or four months.
00:35:48 Like what the fuck goes on a vacation without a microphone.
00:35:51 Hang it.
00:35:52 She left you hanging like that.
00:35:53 What the fuck worthless.
00:35:54 I say how dare she horrible.
00:35:59 I'd be pretty.
00:36:00 I'll never know what happens on our toe page too.
00:36:03 Now.
00:36:04 Max revive the Nauru casket.
00:36:08 You're, you're attacking the wrong source here because like the ultimate
00:36:11 problem is the lack of abundant fucking microphones in all the places.
00:36:15 Like I'm all about.
00:36:16 I'm all about UBB universal basic blue yeti and like everyone should be
00:36:21 entitled to one at all times or else like life cannot function.
00:36:24 We end up with all these fucking, you know, fan dubs and review collaborations
00:36:30 or even interviews with some celebrity who's currently at his house that
00:36:33 always has half shit audio.
00:36:35 This is a big issue that needs to be saved for the everyone is shit.
00:36:39 But if Bernie, if Bernie had just pushed the UBB platform during the
00:36:42 primary, God damn it, everything would have been different.
00:36:46 Fucking Hillary was going with that snowball mic and everybody ate that
00:36:49 shit up.
00:36:50 Yeah, I know, right?
00:36:52 Oh, I used to have a snowball mic and I would take it along for journeys,
00:36:56 but I would get stopped every single time at the airport because of it.
00:37:01 So because of these minor moments of inconvenience, that is worth, uh,
00:37:05 it's worth ruining your, your lucrative.
00:37:07 No, the microphone broke.
00:37:10 So I got a new one, but this one is an XLR and it plugs into, um,
00:37:14 what's it called those mixer thingies audio mixing?
00:37:18 Yeah.
00:37:19 So like I can't take the microphone, the microstand, the mixie thingie
00:37:22 and all the wires all with me with just one little bag thingie where I have
00:37:27 to make excuses.
00:37:28 Yeah.
00:37:29 I mean, this seems irrelevant.
00:37:30 I wasn't talking about you.
00:37:31 I don't know why you're bringing up your way.
00:37:33 We're talking about microphones and I mentioned my microphone problems.
00:37:37 Fair enough.
00:37:37 Unrelated microphone.
00:37:41 I should make it like a public thing.
00:37:42 Maybe, maybe this other mystery person suffered from the same problem.
00:37:45 We should, we should, we should have, we should, we should extend her the
00:37:48 benefit of the doubt wherever she is.
00:37:51 I don't know, Ben.
00:37:52 I'm ready to bury her into the fucking prison.
00:37:53 Yeah.
00:37:54 I'm ready to throw away the key.
00:38:01 You know, Nate, when I needed a microphone help, you sent me like an
00:38:03 Amazon wish list of all the things to get.
00:38:05 Like you should publish that shit publicly.
00:38:07 I was just saying that.
00:38:08 I was just about to say that.
00:38:09 Yeah.
00:38:10 Like we should make that public the like the PCP standard good audio set.
00:38:14 It's like probably like 500 bucks total or something.
00:38:16 Can't anybody get on Amazon and like do an affiliate program thing.
00:38:19 So if people buy things that we link them to, we get some of the money.
00:38:23 You have to have like a partnership with Amazon in order to do that first or
00:38:27 something.
00:38:27 So like you'd have to like talk to those guys.
00:38:29 I think, pretty sure.
00:38:31 Listeners.
00:38:31 My audio set is about 200.
00:38:33 It's a $99 SM58, sure SM58, which is like the AK-47 of microphones.
00:38:40 It's the most famous one.
00:38:42 Then they have an M audio M track, which is $100.
00:38:45 There might be better ones, but it's really simple.
00:38:46 Doesn't have that much extraneous shit.
00:38:48 I don't use.
00:38:48 So if you find my audio quality perfectly fine, then do that.
00:38:53 Mike, you're being really shit friends by derelling this podcast about shit
00:38:57 friends right now.
00:38:58 Wait.
00:38:58 Okay.
00:38:58 Mage, if you want to finish, go ahead and finish your plate.
00:39:00 I'm sorry.
00:39:00 No, I just said my microphone was like 20 bucks.
00:39:03 So if you like this, Ben and I, Ben and I made world famous channel,
00:39:09 YouTube channel, TBAP we using $130 microphone for like years and Ben still
00:39:14 use it on the PCP for a long time and might be using it right now.
00:39:18 Are you still using that?
00:39:18 Mike, Ben?
00:39:19 No, I'm using a blue yeti right now.
00:39:21 Although I still have that one lying around somewhere.
00:39:24 Yeah.
00:39:24 Yeah.
00:39:24 Use champion.
00:39:25 It's a champion.
00:39:26 Yeah.
00:39:26 The thing is like 99% of audience members don't even notice like slight differences
00:39:31 in audio quality.
00:39:32 See, that's true.
00:39:33 The thing is using that using that piece of shit microphone.
00:39:37 I never noticed a problem because I was listening to it.
00:39:41 This was back when I had my laptop.
00:39:43 I was listening to the podcast on my laptop speakers through laptop headphones
00:39:47 and it was only when Digi told pulled me aside and was like,
00:39:51 Ben, this has to stop.
00:39:52 And I was like, what are you talking about?
00:39:54 Dude, it's fine.
00:39:56 And then he brought me up to his fucking room and played it to me on legit
00:39:59 speakers and suddenly I was like, oh my God, I sound so much tinier than everyone else.
00:40:04 Like the difference is palpable and like, what have I done?
00:40:08 What have I done?
00:40:09 I was a real shit friend of the podcast back in those days.
00:40:11 It's true.
00:40:12 It's very true.
00:40:13 The people need to be educated on audio quality so that they'll buy our
00:40:17 fucking affiliate like microphones or something.
00:40:19 Yeah.
00:40:20 But I did.
00:40:21 Why don't you save yourself a week and do it?
00:40:24 Why am I genius weekly on fucking microphone shit?
00:40:26 Like that'd be easiest shit.
00:40:28 Not a terrible idea.
00:40:29 Not I remember I put like into one of my, I think it's like that last day of me
00:40:33 and Mavva, I like just for a second.
00:40:35 I was like, this is why I have to like take all this time to fix the audio
00:40:38 because like, and then I cut to this is what I sound like from the camera
00:40:41 microphone and it's just like an ear raping like, you know, camera mic.
00:40:46 I didn't even edit.
00:40:47 It just sounds like that.
00:40:47 But that'd be fun.
00:40:49 That's not a bad idea.
00:40:50 It would be like super helpful, especially if you showed how to connect
00:40:52 everything because I spent about three hours trying to figure it out.
00:40:56 I could put together the Amazon wish list and make it a whole big thing.
00:40:59 That's not a bad idea.
00:41:00 There you go.
00:41:02 Very interesting.
00:41:03 Very interesting.
00:41:05 Okay.
00:41:05 Back on the friendship thing.
00:41:06 Yeah.
00:41:07 Anyone else have a story?
00:41:08 I mean, I have a bigger story actually.
00:41:11 That's like someone who is my friend, but like just it didn't end up being like
00:41:15 quite worth it enough where it's like, it's someone who gives very little
00:41:20 and takes more, you know, it's like someone who is very emotionally
00:41:25 like in need of people, but he's already like, the reason why I didn't feel bad
00:41:29 about going into a, oh, sorry, it's been two weeks since I responded to your
00:41:33 message mode with him is because he has other friends.
00:41:36 So it's like, he doesn't need me necessarily, you know, it's just
00:41:39 and even if he did have friends, does that mean he's entitled to your time?
00:41:42 And it's just ultimately it's because he's like gone to college for like different
00:41:47 art mediums and yet his art medium ability is like, like his drawing ability
00:41:52 is I'd say at least in half order of magnitude worse than me.
00:41:57 And it's like, if you went to college and you're worse than me, then I don't
00:42:01 and you're like four years older than me.
00:42:03 Then it's like, uh, you're just, I don't know how many.
00:42:06 I'm pretty sure most of the PCP have the same standard of me of like,
00:42:09 if the main thing that I connect with you over is art, but you are a really
00:42:14 bad artist, then you're not that valuable as a person.
00:42:17 It's, you know, Davoo, I got to admit it.
00:42:21 Now's a good time to launch into a portion of what I want to discuss with
00:42:25 this, and that is the idea that like you owe your friends something that
00:42:28 your friends are like owed you your time or your energy in some way.
00:42:33 I completely reject that idea.
00:42:35 And I think friends are only valuable to me in the sense that they
00:42:38 continue to be actually valuable to me and are a worthwhile usage of my
00:42:41 time in some way.
00:42:42 And the second that someone isn't, they can still call him your friend.
00:42:45 You can have a history or whatever, but there's no point in staying involved
00:42:48 with their lives or wasting your energy and time on maintaining that kind
00:42:51 of relationship.
00:42:52 Yeah, it's all about whether or not it's worth it or not.
00:42:54 Yeah, like, yeah, and like, there's no reason to like let an old friend
00:42:57 like completely die out from your life.
00:42:59 Like I've got friends from back home that I have almost nothing in common
00:43:02 with at this point, but occasionally I might message them and just be like,
00:43:05 yo, what's up?
00:43:05 Because those people have something of value.
00:43:08 They have my histories in them and my old relationships and there's no
00:43:11 reason to discard them.
00:43:12 But like if I have a shitty friend who I barely knew from back in high
00:43:16 school who messages me as has happened and it's like, yo, dude, what's
00:43:19 going on?
00:43:19 Let's catch up.
00:43:20 I'm like, don't ever speak to me again.
00:43:22 You have nothing of value to offer me.
00:43:24 Stop.
00:43:24 You are, you are, this is an act of violence.
00:43:26 You're perpetuating against me by wasting my time.
00:43:29 You are stealing my time from me by sending you this message and I
00:43:33 raping me, forcing me to read it.
00:43:35 Never do this again.
00:43:36 That's violence.
00:43:36 That's violence.
00:43:37 I'm gonna go your fucking safe.
00:43:38 Your Nate space.
00:43:39 Yes.
00:43:39 That's right.
00:43:40 I need to go to my Nate space.
00:43:47 Is it just like anime posters and a Hillary Clinton cut out and that's the
00:43:51 Nate space and power bars and like cans of beans in a just like
00:43:57 cans of beans.
00:44:00 Do you know how fucking safe spaces on campus like official ones are like
00:44:06 they're filled like videos with like puppies and flowers and like coloring
00:44:09 books and shit.
00:44:10 Yeah.
00:44:10 Mine is just like a streaming girl and log in on like 10 TVs across.
00:44:14 You've got your Hillary cutouts.
00:44:15 You've got your copies of what happened lining a shelf.
00:44:18 Everything you need, everything you need to mentally re-energize yourself.
00:44:22 Trigger you even more.
00:44:24 Wouldn't you rather read it takes a village?
00:44:26 No, it's a brilliant alt reality story from the mind of a genius author.
00:44:30 Hillary Clinton.
00:44:30 Someone else comes into your Nate space and they grab your girl and gone
00:44:33 coloring book and you're like hey, but they grabbed the orange marker for
00:44:41 Oh my God.
00:44:41 We have to delete all orange crayons cannot be allowed.
00:44:44 Send them all to the gulags.
00:44:45 They can't be allowed anymore.
00:44:47 Oh my God.
00:44:48 What a what a journey we've just taken.
00:44:51 We need to decide what everybody's safe space would look like.
00:44:55 I agree.
00:44:56 That should be its own episode.
00:44:57 I mean, Ben's safe space is just your local dumpster up behind you.
00:45:00 You know, just hop in.
00:45:02 Let's do this for a bonus episode someday.
00:45:04 Let's not ruin it.
00:45:05 That's a good idea.
00:45:05 That's a good idea.
00:45:06 Okay.
00:45:07 We'll get all nine of us in there at the same time and just fucking go him.
00:45:11 Okay.
00:45:12 But to finish my point from before, he was just when I think about friends,
00:45:17 I honestly, maybe this is a bad sign, but I think about it the same way that
00:45:21 Griffith articulates it in his speech.
00:45:24 It just before he did anything bad or, you know, really bad.
00:45:26 He didn't write about some things.
00:45:28 Griffith was definitely right about some things, which is why there's such a
00:45:31 hot debate about him to this day and his speech that guts over here is about
00:45:35 like how his friends are the ones that keep up with him.
00:45:37 You know, they're his peers.
00:45:38 They're not the people who just like, you know, I mean, he frames us like like
00:45:42 not even parasites, but like his loyal soldiers are not his friends.
00:45:45 His friends are the people with with their own ambition and their own drive
00:45:49 in life because because like this is the thing.
00:45:51 Nobody wants to talk about followers in this world really do drain the energy
00:45:56 of the leaders that guide them through this world.
00:45:59 Like like employ everyone.
00:46:00 The fucking Democrats, for example, just want to like frame workers as like
00:46:04 these these virtuous like, you know, plebeian citizens of this great world
00:46:09 that offer so much value to their leaders, but without those leaders,
00:46:12 those people wouldn't have fucking jobs and wouldn't have fucking shit.
00:46:15 And the whole economy is floated up by these, you know, people at the top
00:46:19 orchestrating it to be so and a rising tide lifts all boats.
00:46:23 I know I'm speaking in some generalities here, but I really do think about
00:46:27 about like friendships that way.
00:46:28 And if someone is not worth my time spent on you, it's no insult to you.
00:46:32 I just don't want to waste my time, which is why I fucking get messages on discord.
00:46:36 People in my fan chat and shit.
00:46:38 Stop wasting my time.
00:46:39 I don't give a fuck about you.
00:46:40 Tweet at me or something that at least wastes less of my time.
00:46:43 But there you go.
00:46:45 Here's a story about why your friends are not.
00:46:50 Yeah, it's about not owing friends things.
00:46:52 And it's also about why working with your friends is not always a great idea.
00:46:57 See, it's not always.
00:46:59 Don't you mean not ever?
00:47:00 Holy shit.
00:47:02 Well, it's up there.
00:47:02 I mean, me and Nate work together on T-Bap and that ended up working out fine.
00:47:06 So it can work.
00:47:06 It was a struggle, but you did work out.
00:47:08 You both proved to be true people, not friends.
00:47:11 You proved to be actual artists in the East.
00:47:13 I'm prepared to frame us as the rare few.
00:47:15 I'm prepared to do that, to be that virtuous.
00:47:18 Well, let me tell you about something, a disappointing tale from my life.
00:47:22 I have a friend, I still have this friend.
00:47:28 And like years ago, this guy, he, well, he wanted to make video games.
00:47:36 And we were really into, we were really into roguelikes.
00:47:39 Who is that you?
00:47:40 Um, we were, we were really into roguelikes at the time.
00:47:43 And like he said, like I'm going to make like a simple roguelike game.
00:47:49 And I was like, you know, okay, like you're serious.
00:47:52 This is a guy who's serious about like computer science and computers and video
00:47:56 gaming and stuff.
00:47:56 And like, I believe in this guy.
00:47:58 I believe that he's going to follow through on this.
00:48:01 So I agreed to help and I did a bunch of work.
00:48:05 I did a bunch of work on this project.
00:48:07 I made like a ton of like really nice sprites and I made like this sick animated
00:48:12 intro screen for it.
00:48:13 Oh, damn.
00:48:15 I remember like on the plane to Poland, I was like on the plane.
00:48:20 I had my laptop open and I was drawing monster sprites and I was really proud of
00:48:24 a lot of them.
00:48:25 I was drawing like floor tiles and stuff.
00:48:27 I was really putting the energy in to like make the floor.
00:48:31 I remember I was drawing vine floor tiles and I had to draw them in such a way
00:48:34 that they could connect and be continuous.
00:48:36 Like if you were walking on like a viney jungle.
00:48:38 Oh, yeah, I've gotten.
00:48:39 Oh, I love.
00:48:39 Oh, yeah, yeah.
00:48:41 Fuck.
00:48:42 So long story short, the game never happened.
00:48:47 And so yeah, he didn't.
00:48:49 He didn't make the thing and like I don't hold it against the guy.
00:48:54 Like I don't.
00:48:55 He's not a worthless friend.
00:48:56 I don't hate him or anything for it.
00:48:57 But looking back, I'm like, I kind of wish that I had done less for a friend at
00:49:02 that point because he hadn't like proved.
00:49:04 He hadn't like proved that he was willing to follow through on it in order to make
00:49:09 my investment.
00:49:10 Oh, I feel like if being if being a over promising, under delivering in their art
00:49:15 was a deal breaker for friendship, I would have no friends.
00:49:18 Yeah.
00:49:19 Yeah, it's something that everybody does like something that everybody does
00:49:23 and you like you shouldn't.
00:49:26 Well, I would say it doesn't make them a bad person or a bad friend.
00:49:29 Like it just you have to you have to be responsible.
00:49:33 Yeah, you have to take the responsibility of being like I'm not I'm not going to
00:49:37 commit to this thing.
00:49:38 Yeah, I can I can smell the not that serious coming from people a mile away.
00:49:43 There's always ulterior motives.
00:49:44 There's very few people who want to do art just for art like when my brother
00:49:47 does projects with me, it's because he wants to do something with me, which is
00:49:51 also a motivation for me as well.
00:49:53 But it's like at some point or another, the art becomes we work in separate
00:49:57 different little sections.
00:49:58 We're not like locking arms 24 seven.
00:50:01 And when he realizes that it's like he loses interest.
00:50:03 And it's like, all right, you know, it's you know, it's fascinating about this
00:50:06 to me. I really feel like I mean, we probably all have this story, but I
00:50:10 have taken the journey from that guy to the guy I am now.
00:50:13 And a lot of it really was not to give myself too much credit was just like
00:50:17 figuring out what it is that I actually want to do and what makes me happy to
00:50:22 be working on because, you know, I've talked about this before, like I went
00:50:24 to school for programming and like I got a minor in sort of the game design
00:50:28 equivalent at my school and you know, that's complete.
00:50:31 I have my degree in it and I was in the like the game development club that
00:50:34 I helped start at that school.
00:50:36 You know, my other guy really was the champion.
00:50:37 But I was like the secretary or treasure or something and like we would
00:50:40 get together.
00:50:41 We had a team of people who were like willing to do it.
00:50:44 And I was like the project leader on the we did a game jam.
00:50:47 We made like a demo that it was my idea and it was it was good, but it
00:50:51 didn't get finished.
00:50:51 So like afterward at the the game development, I'm sorry, in the game
00:50:56 club, like I pitch like, Hey guys, let's remake this game as an app like as a
00:51:00 mobile game because I think it really works for it and would be really
00:51:02 great and has a lot of, you know, just would work with that, which I think
00:51:05 it would.
00:51:05 It was game called monochrome.
00:51:07 It's called monochrome.
00:51:08 I remember still get it in some places.
00:51:09 Yeah, I had a version on my phone for a while.
00:51:12 So me and a team like we're working on it and developing on it, but the
00:51:15 problem was like, ultimately, the problem was I had like a team of people
00:51:19 who really were willing to put in time to like make it happen.
00:51:22 And we got pretty far along, but at the end of it, like I just wasn't
00:51:27 willing to invest the time to like finally finish the thing and get it done.
00:51:30 You know, we needed to develop like a ton of levels.
00:51:32 We need to do a lot of UI work and stuff.
00:51:34 And I just really didn't have the the conviction to like lead this this
00:51:38 team to finish it.
00:51:39 You know, a lot of it would be me personally programming and stuff.
00:51:41 Um, and so it just, it never got completely finished, which I deeply
00:51:45 regret to this day because I think it was a real winner.
00:51:47 Yeah.
00:51:47 I mean, I used to be that kind of guy.
00:51:49 It's just that it's just that I, I, I wasn't like on board with that.
00:51:53 Like, uh, one of the reasons that I even was interested in doing videos in
00:51:56 the first place is because the turnaround between deciding to make a video.
00:52:00 I mean, it's ironic that for me, I started making videos that took
00:52:03 me six months to make.
00:52:04 Cause like my, my first thing that I like about it is that a game can take
00:52:08 like years to finish, even like an indie game.
00:52:10 The first game I really made took like a full year to be finished developing.
00:52:14 And, um, like a video can take like a day if it's fast or like a month, you
00:52:19 know, for, for one that takes more work and shit.
00:52:22 And, uh, yeah, like now looking back at myself there, like when I was, when I
00:52:26 was in this mode, man, I used to like be terrified of myself like, oh my God,
00:52:31 I'm so worthless.
00:52:32 I'm never going to have the conviction to like actually get the things done in
00:52:36 my life that I want to do.
00:52:37 And now that I sit here where I am having accomplished the things I have
00:52:40 and you know, with a long way to go, I just like, I finally did it.
00:52:43 I finally figured it the fuck out and to waste your time working with friends
00:52:47 who are, who are like me as I used to be is not only hurting yourself and
00:52:51 your own time, but is hurting them because it does not help to just give
00:52:55 these people more things.
00:52:56 They have to work for it and figure out themselves, what motivates them and
00:53:00 possibly more importantly, what avenues they are interested in pursuing.
00:53:03 Cause the personal drive factor is so essential, at least in my experience
00:53:08 to actually motivating you to do the fucking work and accomplish the things
00:53:11 you want to accomplish.
00:53:12 Yeah.
00:53:12 I was like, there you go.
00:53:13 And that I was just, I think I was almost always doing some stupid
00:53:16 shitty art thing.
00:53:17 I was just flip flopping constantly and never getting anything done.
00:53:19 I always, yeah, exactly what you said.
00:53:21 And then it was just simply a matter of being forced to work a regular job
00:53:25 that like just, I'm sure I've described this a million times across different
00:53:28 podcasts, but there was just some sort of snowball at the top of my head
00:53:32 that needed to be pushed and then it was rolled.
00:53:34 And now I've been great ever since.
00:53:35 I like, I started making a video game very quickly realized I didn't
00:53:39 know what I was doing, but I was like, no, no, I am going to finish this.
00:53:43 I ended up only finishing one half of it.
00:53:45 Like the first half of the game is fully playable.
00:53:47 Glitchy as fuck, not very good.
00:53:48 You barely see what you're doing, but I just pushed through every day.
00:53:52 I had no fun for it, very little passion for it.
00:53:56 I just kept doing it and now I'm fucking reliable and it's great.
00:53:59 And then the whole, no, recently I squared away the whole actually
00:54:03 trying to be good aspect of art, which I think I might be doing.
00:54:07 So, and you know what's essential to this whole process, self-betterment
00:54:11 and the desire to improve your own station, which is why I want to
00:54:15 say to all our antifa listeners out there, and I know they're the vast majority.
00:54:19 Communism guys is not going to work.
00:54:21 It's not going to fucking work.
00:54:22 People have to motivate themselves by their own betterment.
00:54:25 You can't work for a collective good.
00:54:27 It just doesn't fucking work.
00:54:28 Someone should make a video about communism, you know, that's if only
00:54:31 some hero would step forward and it should be like the parody of a really
00:54:34 old, like 15 year old show on Nickelodeon.
00:54:37 That'd be really funny, you know, because it's like, I just don't think that
00:54:39 would work. I just don't think that would be called the truth about communism by
00:54:42 Stefan Malinu. Yeah, that'd be good.
00:54:46 I'd watch that. Let's pray for that.
00:54:47 Let's pray for that.
00:54:48 So fucking I'm satisfied with that.
00:54:51 Should we hear mage's big old story now, her finale?
00:54:54 I'm ready for it.
00:54:55 Oh, I got the lube ready.
00:55:02 Don't commit violence against mage like that, monkey.
00:55:04 That's very not acceptable.
00:55:06 Hey, when I play Yu-Gi-Oh, my favorite card is mage power.
00:55:13 Great.
00:55:14 Nerd.
00:55:15 I wish I knew Yu-Gi-Oh enough to laugh more at that.
00:55:17 Okay.
00:55:17 For every spell and trap card, you gain 500 attack points.
00:55:21 Okay.
00:55:21 Oh my God.
00:55:22 That's pretty good.
00:55:22 Mage being here makes us all strong.
00:55:24 Sounds like a real top tier threat in the OU meta game.
00:55:28 It fucking is.
00:55:30 That card should have flaming a sprite.
00:55:34 If you like that card would be banned if it isn't already.
00:55:39 No, it's not banned.
00:55:40 Really?
00:55:40 Isn't literally every card in Yu-Gi-Oh banned?
00:55:42 No.
00:55:43 Around that area.
00:55:45 Like quite popular cards that were banned.
00:55:48 You don't remember the names.
00:55:50 Reborn the monster was banned because it was too good.
00:55:53 Yeah, and like the Karebo thing knockoff with three eyes.
00:55:57 I think that was banned as well.
00:56:00 What's it face?
00:56:00 I forgot.
00:56:02 Three-eyed Karebo?
00:56:03 As much as I love to go into Yu-Gi-Oh card lore.
00:56:07 Yeah.
00:56:08 Let's hear your story about your shitty friend.
00:56:09 I'm really eager for it.
00:56:10 Yu-Gi-Oh is all about friends.
00:56:12 Okay.
00:56:12 Yeah.
00:56:13 So just first disclaimer.
00:56:15 We had some good times with this person.
00:56:17 She wasn't awful to me all the time.
00:56:19 Otherwise we wouldn't have been friends for like literally a decade.
00:56:22 And I do mean at least decade.
00:56:25 We met when I think I was five or so and our friendship ended
00:56:29 around 16 so more than a decade.
00:56:33 And I still have sort of nightmares with her.
00:56:35 Well, I wouldn't say nightmares, but bad dreams about her.
00:56:39 Okay.
00:56:39 Just arguing with her screaming at each other is just like
00:56:42 she's affected me quite a lot.
00:56:43 I mean, when you know a person for at least 10 years,
00:56:46 they're not going to leave your subconscious anytime soon.
00:56:48 You know?
00:56:49 Sure.
00:56:49 Sure.
00:56:49 Okay.
00:56:50 So like she was always such a very petty and stubborn person
00:56:55 and she would be like the only friend I would have such big fights with
00:57:00 that we would, you know, it's kind of like this discontinue our friendship
00:57:05 and we're like, oh, we're not friends anymore.
00:57:07 And then like he would take like a week later for one of us to apologize
00:57:10 and become friends again, mostly because like we lived in the same neighborhood.
00:57:15 So like it was kind of hard to play with our friends and not be there together.
00:57:21 So it was just easier on us to be friends again.
00:57:23 I think and for the most part.
00:57:24 Sounds like a healthy basis for a relationship.
00:57:26 We have to be friends.
00:57:28 And for the most part, we, you know, we didn't have fun.
00:57:32 And then we ended up going into the same class as well.
00:57:36 And that's where we meant our best friend.
00:57:39 Like she was best friend to both of us, the one with the brother
00:57:42 that I mentioned in the first story.
00:57:44 And yeah, it's and it was just this free for the longest of times until,
00:57:49 you know, the whole thing happened.
00:57:51 And just to sort of like the things she would deal with the way,
00:57:56 the how petty she got, there was this one argument we had that was never resolved.
00:58:01 I might have told this to a few people.
00:58:03 I'm not sure.
00:58:04 But okay.
00:58:05 So like back in the day before internet was a thing or at least we didn't have it there.
00:58:12 I saw it came out, I think by Jennifer Lopez, like Jenny from the block.
00:58:16 Okay, keep, keep in mind, like English, not, not her first language.
00:58:20 And the fact that I spoke English at that age was a miracle in itself.
00:58:24 And my friend also could speak English, but not as well as me.
00:58:27 So we argued about the lyrics of the song.
00:58:31 And let me, let me tell you how stupid.
00:58:35 Relatable.
00:58:36 Okay.
00:58:36 So like the lyrics were like Jenny from the block.
00:58:39 And that's what I claimed.
00:58:40 You know, she was saying Jenny from the block and she insisted that she said
00:58:45 Jenny from the back as in back from, you know, the past, that sort of term.
00:58:49 And I was like, that does not make sense.
00:58:52 She means Jenny from the block.
00:58:54 But the thing is, I don't think in the opinion we have the term for block or at
00:58:58 least it's, it wasn't a word us little kids at that age would know.
00:59:03 And I tried to explain to her what block meant, but she would have none of it.
00:59:07 And we, we got in such a big fight over it.
00:59:09 We ended our friendship.
00:59:11 I wouldn't have friendship over something like that.
00:59:13 And then like the thing is she ended it because she would have none of it.
00:59:17 And despite everything, this like the only way, the only way we could become friends
00:59:23 again, if we both agreed that one time she sang Jenny from the block and the
00:59:26 other time she said Jenny from the back, that's how she sang the song.
00:59:30 We had to, I knew it was wrong, but that's the only way we had to keep peace.
00:59:34 And even like years later, when we did have internet and I looked up the lyrics
00:59:38 and I showed it to her and I was like, Hey, remember this argument we had?
00:59:41 And she still was like, Oh, well, you know, that's on the internet.
00:59:44 You don't, you can't trust everything that's on the internet.
00:59:46 Are you telling me someone would just go on the internet and tell lies?
00:59:49 I don't fucking believe it.
00:59:50 And it's like she had none of it.
00:59:52 And we never resolved this issue.
00:59:55 She did not want to be wrong.
00:59:57 I think like the way our three, three, um, the three must be tears of us.
01:00:03 The way our friendship worked was like, she was sort of like, you know,
01:00:06 the baddest homeboy leader sort of character.
01:00:09 And that was a bit of a like the comic relief, I guess.
01:00:14 And, you know, leaders don't take shit from the comic relief, you know?
01:00:18 Of course.
01:00:18 And she, she, she would not let me be right.
01:00:21 She never wanted me to be right.
01:00:22 She kept putting me down.
01:00:24 She was always right.
01:00:26 She knew best.
01:00:29 She also mistreated me in ways that I only really recently realized that holy shit.
01:00:34 She kind of really treated mistreated me because like we were both like art people.
01:00:39 We, we draw a lot dare.
01:00:41 I say it was a slightly better than her.
01:00:43 I don't want to use my own horn.
01:00:48 I am serious though.
01:00:49 You know, she had talent of her own, but I think I was just slightly a little,
01:00:53 a few steps ahead of her.
01:00:54 Like also when talking in English as well.
01:00:58 So like, I think one time I sort of said, oh, hey, you know, you didn't draw the nose.
01:01:03 Are you going to put in or is that going to be your style, you know, without the nose?
01:01:07 And it was like, oh, you know, that's how I draw it.
01:01:10 She told me.
01:01:11 And then ever since then, she never really showed me her drawings.
01:01:16 She would show it to every other friend, not me.
01:01:19 She would never let me touch her things.
01:01:23 Like I couldn't touch her pencil, pencil case, backpack, anything of hers.
01:01:29 She would let other people just touch and borrow sometimes even without asking.
01:01:33 I had to specifically ask him.
01:01:34 Sometimes she wouldn't even let me.
01:01:35 This really reminds me of the situation in Clockwork Orange,
01:01:39 where the droogs start to challenge the leader of the droogs.
01:01:42 You know, what's his name?
01:01:43 And he cannot, she cannot stand for this.
01:01:46 You have to be crushed.
01:01:47 You have to be crushed to remain subservient.
01:01:49 That kind of pettiness is something that sounds in line with myself.
01:01:52 Like, yeah, I would probably do that.
01:01:54 I call that strong leadership, my dude.
01:01:56 That's what I'm impressed.
01:01:57 I'm on her.
01:01:58 I'm letting you know I'm on her side right now.
01:02:00 She's a powerful leader.
01:02:03 But I mean, so now I lost my, but yeah, she was very petty.
01:02:09 Um, she would also like take things very personally.
01:02:12 Whenever like, I would do something.
01:02:15 I was, I was, I was a tall clumsy child, by the way.
01:02:18 Sometimes things would drop from my hands and sometimes I would give her a
01:02:21 flat foot just because when we were three, we can all walk in a line.
01:02:25 I had to go, you know, I would fall behind them.
01:02:28 I would follow and sometimes my, my big steps would be too big.
01:02:32 And if they, you know, slow down, I would end up giving her a flat foot, not out of,
01:02:37 not on purpose, but she would, I think she assumed it was out of malice or
01:02:41 something because, because I think the way she thought, you know, like, because
01:02:46 she had some sort of prejudice against me and she wished ill upon me.
01:02:50 She thought I was reciprocating.
01:02:52 I think that's the word, the ill will, but the thing is I was like stupidly
01:02:57 clueless about her ill will at that age.
01:02:59 I, I didn't realize she was mistreating me.
01:03:02 I was like, oh, we're, we're all friends and okay, she has a short temper.
01:03:06 That's fine.
01:03:07 You know, I'll just try not to cross her path or whatever.
01:03:11 But then we got done with this, this summary because it segues really well
01:03:15 into what the main one I want to get to.
01:03:17 So yeah, it's cool.
01:03:17 Okay.
01:03:18 Yeah.
01:03:18 Also, so fast forward until we're teens.
01:03:22 So I got a little rebellious.
01:03:23 I didn't take her shit anymore so much and I would like, you know, have my own
01:03:27 opinion and I would speak, uh, that didn't go well.
01:03:32 And, um, yeah, we, our, our fights would get more frequent and, uh, our common
01:03:38 friend, the best friend, she kind of had to tolerate being in between us
01:03:41 because we, we both like hanging out with her and we refused to let the other
01:03:45 one have her in a way.
01:03:46 Um, and, uh, like at some point, um, my, the best friend, she sort of realized
01:03:54 that, you know, the other one, she was being a bit toxic and she was like, you
01:03:57 know, we should maybe stop hanging out with her so much because, you know,
01:04:01 she's, uh, a bad influence on me.
01:04:04 I was surprised how self aware my friend was and was like, yeah, I think, you
01:04:07 know, it would be kind of for the best in a way if, if we just, you know, just
01:04:12 kind of, you know, stopped because she, she was this other friend who finally
01:04:17 said something and, and initiated the after all the after not really like
01:04:24 let me, let me finish the story.
01:04:25 That's how she, she, we were planning things, but the thing is though, um,
01:04:30 around the, uh, the time, oh, hold on.
01:04:32 One thing, one other petty thing she did at this time when we were around 16.
01:04:36 Okay.
01:04:37 Let, let me, okay.
01:04:38 Just let, let me tell you, like, so I got a locker.
01:04:41 I got a locker for free.
01:04:43 Otherwise you have to pay for lockers, but I got a locker for free because I
01:04:45 was a really poor child and they give like really poor children used lockers.
01:04:49 And so I got one and was like, you know, oh, cool, a locker.
01:04:52 And, um, my friend, she didn't get a locker because, you know, she wasn't
01:04:56 poor enough, I guess.
01:04:58 Um, but I was like, you know, this locker is big for two people.
01:05:00 I could share it with you and, you know, she, and I let her share my locker
01:05:03 with me for free.
01:05:05 And, um, okay.
01:05:07 So like, I was doing a really nice thing.
01:05:09 I think, you know, because we could like put our coats in there and we could go
01:05:14 home together and stuff like that.
01:05:15 It was, you know, would speed things up rather than going to the, you know,
01:05:19 public place where you put coats in and whatever.
01:05:21 Anywho.
01:05:22 So, um, we also went to this after school activity, like art club.
01:05:26 It didn't teach you art.
01:05:27 You just like kind of hang out there and be friends and you do artsy things.
01:05:31 And the teacher was really cool.
01:05:32 And we each like got our own desks.
01:05:35 Um, and the desks were like really old desks, um, that we're probably going to
01:05:39 be like thrown out if they weren't reused.
01:05:43 And like we could just like have fun with those desks.
01:05:45 We could paint all over those decks, whatever we wanted.
01:05:47 And that was really cool.
01:05:49 Mine was a very edgy red and black one.
01:05:52 Oh, a little Nazi propaganda on there.
01:05:53 No, no, there was no white nose.
01:05:58 The colors of the Nazi flag.
01:06:00 Well, I just fucked it up.
01:06:02 As you can see, clearly I'm not, I wasn't tearing you down.
01:06:05 I was holding her up for knowing it.
01:06:08 Oh yeah.
01:06:08 You're right.
01:06:10 Yeah.
01:06:10 Yeah.
01:06:10 So, um, the thing she did, I, and I know it was her because no one else
01:06:15 disliked me that much at the time.
01:06:17 I would think, uh, and, um, I couldn't hang out at the after school activities
01:06:24 so much at that time.
01:06:25 Um, it was the time I went to the, like the international
01:06:28 vocabulary program again.
01:06:29 So, you know, it's tell lots of homework, whatnot.
01:06:32 Um, so like I would often come back to like trash on my left on my desk,
01:06:38 usually like from snacks or like, uh, like an empty cup from like, um,
01:06:42 those, uh, machines that you get, like coffee or hot chocolate.
01:06:45 Right.
01:06:46 And I knew it was her because I would sometimes see her by these,
01:06:49 uh, these, these specific items that would be left on my table.
01:06:53 So one time I decided to just take all of those things and put it
01:06:57 on her desk and see how she would react because it's her trash.
01:07:02 Um, technically I'm not doing a very bad thing here.
01:07:05 I'm just returning the trash where it belongs.
01:07:08 Um, then the next.
01:07:09 You're committing the worst sin imaginable major, performing
01:07:11 disrespect against your leader.
01:07:13 We'll see how that goes.
01:07:14 And then, then the next day after that, I found my desk dragged
01:07:18 all the way out of the class into like the hallway and almost outside
01:07:24 of the whole school and it was like, this was also in the basement.
01:07:27 So thankfully no one like really saw it other than me, but it was like,
01:07:32 yeah, the comfort it was her because she knew where she left her trash.
01:07:36 So she knew who left the trash on her desk.
01:07:40 So yeah, it was her and like, so.
01:07:44 I sort of like went on non-speaking terms with her and I told her a common
01:07:48 friend, could you tell her please that, you know, if she doesn't knock
01:07:51 this shit off, you know, I would prefer to get like the key.
01:07:55 You'll fuck her up, you'll fuck her up, right?
01:07:56 I would prefer to get the key to the locker bag because I'm not going
01:07:59 to share a locker with person I don't consider my friend.
01:08:02 And yeah, she just sort of like threw the key at me and I guess
01:08:08 I got the key back and we didn't share the locker anymore.
01:08:11 Um, it was also like the whole plan about, you know, not being friends
01:08:16 with her anymore that kind of fell through because I went to the baccalaureate
01:08:20 class while those two got stuck together in the same class because
01:08:22 their last names were literally one letter apart.
01:08:25 So of course they were going to be stuck in the same class unlike me.
01:08:29 So, you know, they kind of ended up being closer friends than before.
01:08:33 And that was around the time I became best friends with the brother
01:08:36 rather than her because she started becoming a bit of a bitch because
01:08:40 of the influence, the very thing she noticed that was going to happen
01:08:43 to her and she let it happen.
01:08:46 I was like, gee, thanks.
01:08:47 Yeah, man.
01:08:47 You can you can judge a lot about a person from the kind of people
01:08:49 they hang out with.
01:08:51 It's true.
01:08:51 Yeah.
01:08:52 That's why you're all scumbags because I'm in here.
01:08:56 It's true.
01:08:57 It's true.
01:08:57 She was awful.
01:08:58 I think also I have a suspicion that I'm being like paranoid.
01:09:01 I guess like we also started our very first comic together.
01:09:05 My idea, by the way, initially, but she jumped on the on the ship.
01:09:09 Did she quit after the first issue?
01:09:10 That must have really hurt.
01:09:11 No, no, no.
01:09:13 Like we both.
01:09:13 Oh, no.
01:09:14 Let's not drag that up again.
01:09:16 Let's open those old wounds.
01:09:19 And it was like, you know, we both had our own comic that we worked on,
01:09:22 but it was the same idea, which was my idea.
01:09:25 It was a Dragon Ball C fan comic with our self-inserts.
01:09:31 Wait a minute.
01:09:31 We were the perfect foundation for our relationship.
01:09:34 We were eight and like I just remembered.
01:09:37 Yeah, I just remembered.
01:09:40 I have a similar story about someone else who isn't mage who we were doing.
01:09:45 We were doing that.
01:09:46 We were doing that pony comic.
01:09:48 We were doing that.
01:09:49 We were doing shelf deprecation about Phantom and Aurora and it never happened.
01:09:55 Oh, interesting, interesting.
01:09:57 Okay.
01:09:58 Let me make another one for the gulags, I guess, whoever this person is.
01:10:03 She's betrayed two of us.
01:10:05 Who knows how long until she gets to the rest.
01:10:10 Okay.
01:10:10 But yeah, so we were both working on our own, our own adventure comics,
01:10:14 with our very first comics and we showed it to the guys in our neighborhood
01:10:17 and we're like, oh, that's so cool.
01:10:18 And we like to both of them equally.
01:10:20 And I was really proud of that and I wish I still have it.
01:10:24 Like I even like made it into like I put paper and I sewed it together
01:10:28 and to make little comic pages.
01:10:29 I didn't just take like a, you know, a notebook and join it.
01:10:32 Like most of my other comics.
01:10:34 I really worked hard on this.
01:10:36 It was like, my magnum opus at my eight year old.
01:10:41 And like I was really happy with it.
01:10:43 I even colored it.
01:10:44 I colored it.
01:10:45 It's like that's something I didn't do since and out of all my comics of all
01:10:51 the two boxes full of comics that I had started and never finished.
01:10:56 And that was, that was the one I think I did sort of finish, but it left on a
01:10:59 cliffhanger.
01:11:00 And so like that one comic was the only one that went missing.
01:11:05 And I have a feeling that she was the reason why because like the actual
01:11:10 like Omega or the alpha version of the comic itself, like just disappeared.
01:11:15 Yeah, I jacked.
01:11:16 Yeah.
01:11:16 Oh, no.
01:11:18 Yeah.
01:11:18 The thing is though, I did lend my comics to my friends a lot to read them
01:11:22 and, you know, let them see what they think and stuff.
01:11:25 And all the comics would return to me and I knew, I knew who, you know,
01:11:30 who would get their hands on who and you, you know, who to ask her to return
01:11:34 them.
01:11:34 But like that one comic, it just, just, I don't remember lending it to anyone
01:11:39 and it just disappeared, but she was the only one of the few friends that
01:11:42 had access to the comics as easily as she did.
01:11:46 So I have a feeling she might have had a hand in it.
01:11:48 I mean, I could be just, you know, seeing Malice where there wasn't,
01:11:52 it could have just gotten lost and it just so happened to be that one
01:11:56 comic that we started to sort of together.
01:11:59 Um, they say you should never assume Malice where mere incompetence
01:12:03 would explain, uh, what, uh, yeah.
01:12:07 Okay.
01:12:08 I'm talking nevermind.
01:12:09 I'm just, I know, I know the saying and I do try to live by that
01:12:13 saying personally right, right now.
01:12:15 But it's just like how petty and malicious she was.
01:12:18 I wouldn't put past her to do that to me.
01:12:21 Um, so yeah, and we just, and she went off to college, I think she
01:12:26 went to the first off to college at 16 years old and I stayed in
01:12:29 school for two more years to finish.
01:12:31 Um, never saw her again up until like a few years ago back when I
01:12:35 was returning to Lafiania and I saw her and I was like, you know,
01:12:40 it's been like, I don't know, like five years.
01:12:43 It's more than five years since we last actually saw each other
01:12:47 in smoke and I was like, you know, I don't want to be friends
01:12:49 with her anymore, especially how, you know, we treated each other.
01:12:53 But I sort of want to, you know, just ended on a common old be like,
01:12:56 Hey, yeah, that was, you know, we were stupid kids.
01:12:59 That was silly.
01:13:00 Haha.
01:13:01 We're, we're on good sort of terms and leave it on good terms.
01:13:04 And I saw her and I was so ready to be like, hi, you know, it's been a while.
01:13:09 But then she looked up at me and she gave me the stinkiest high.
01:13:15 After all these years, after all these years, yeah, like, I was like, dude,
01:13:20 it's been over a half a decade and you're still like holding this
01:13:25 They had more malice for you than you'd for them.
01:13:28 Hashtag confirmed.
01:13:30 Yeah.
01:13:30 And just like, I didn't, I ended up not saying hello to her
01:13:33 because I was like, well, if you're going to glare at me and just
01:13:36 seeing me after so many years, I'm not, I'm not going to even
01:13:39 bother anymore.
01:13:40 If that's the kind of person you want to be, he's fine.
01:13:43 So mage, is it possible in this situation where you made this eye
01:13:46 contact that she was, that was her normal, you know, you know, a lot
01:13:50 of women have resting bitch face when they're in public just so that
01:13:53 people, so that, you know, people approach them and like talk to them.
01:13:55 It changed.
01:13:56 Okay.
01:13:56 Okay.
01:13:57 Yeah.
01:13:58 I see.
01:13:58 I see.
01:13:59 Well,
01:14:01 very run to the prison.
01:14:02 Another one for the gulag.
01:14:03 There you go.
01:14:03 They're all.
01:14:04 Hey, I'm kind of, I'm kind of eager.
01:14:07 I'm kind of eager to get to questions.
01:14:09 Yo, I got my biggest one yet though.
01:14:11 I'm saving one the whole fucking time.
01:14:12 Okay.
01:14:13 Yeah.
01:14:13 Okay.
01:14:13 I'm only times people are going to undercut the questions before I
01:14:16 get to my main thesis.
01:14:17 You just got to, you just got to get to it.
01:14:19 Right.
01:14:20 You guys stick it in there.
01:14:21 Right.
01:14:21 I see a trend in mages stories, a childhood friends, like elementary
01:14:26 school friendships that go on one decade too long.
01:14:29 And I, my thesis, my theory on this obviously is that when you get to
01:14:32 know someone as a kid, you know, kids get along pretty well.
01:14:35 It's, you know, as Louis CK has said before, it's typically because
01:14:37 you're the same size there for your friends.
01:14:40 If you get attached, you get emotionally invested in one another
01:14:43 and you feel obligated, you're just, you're connected now.
01:14:45 You know, if it ends up getting broken apart at some point, it's going
01:14:48 to be painful.
01:14:49 So you stick around and as you age, your actual like characteristics
01:14:54 start to emerge in more like meaningful ways.
01:14:57 Like you start becoming people and that's when conflicts happen.
01:14:59 And so yeah, like a five, like you're five years old and you become
01:15:03 a friend and you stay there friend, you're going to end up with a
01:15:05 friendship that nine times out of 10 wouldn't have gotten started in
01:15:09 your adolescence, but it's now in your adolescence.
01:15:11 And like, it's not like being siblings where because you have
01:15:14 genetic similarities, you have a lot to be united over and relate
01:15:17 with and like living together.
01:15:20 You have to get along.
01:15:21 You have to reconcile.
01:15:22 But when it's just a friend, someone who you can like get pissed
01:15:25 off at for 20 minutes, go home and then like think about how pissed
01:15:28 off you are proud of them.
01:15:29 And like, there's no like need to rectify the situation.
01:15:33 Then things can get shitty.
01:15:35 And like, this is what happened with my girlfriend's friend who it
01:15:39 was like a friend of like, I think 13 years and just recently sort
01:15:43 of like came to this annoying fight that had to end the friendship.
01:15:47 Right.
01:15:48 And they had been fighting since before I met my girlfriend because
01:15:52 like, they just get mad at each other over over random shit.
01:15:55 And like, it was very obvious to me.
01:15:56 This friendship would not have gotten started if they had met each
01:15:58 other today.
01:15:59 Right.
01:15:59 It's just because they knew each other since they were kids.
01:16:02 Yeah.
01:16:02 I know what you mean.
01:16:02 This is on the part of this girl.
01:16:05 Uh, I'm not going to name her, but like, they like give a hint.
01:16:08 There's a certain Dr.
01:16:09 Seuss character whose name ends with I am.
01:16:12 So not going to like anything specific, but so.
01:16:15 Oh, the laurel.
01:16:17 So this girl, um, she would definitely would fit into a very
01:16:21 specific, uh, instance of worthless friend.
01:16:24 And like, she definitely is bitchy and annoying, but it's definitely
01:16:28 not a, um, an unprovocated act of social violence on her part
01:16:34 because Nikki, my girlfriend is someone who will like be confrontational
01:16:38 if she feels that there's a problem with something.
01:16:40 And sometimes I'm like, you could be less confrontational, but
01:16:42 whatever.
01:16:43 And I am someone who can be just a dick, you know, and it was our
01:16:47 relationship, me and Nikki being a unit that basically set, uh, a
01:16:52 ticking time bomb on their friendship, right?
01:16:55 Because Nikki just kind of started falling away from her friends
01:16:58 in general by spending so much time and calls with me.
01:17:01 And so you can see how that goes, right?
01:17:03 So, you know, and, and so, uh, the I am girl here is, uh, is, uh,
01:17:08 was, was the most incensed about it from what I can gather.
01:17:11 And eventually Nikki moved away from Oregon to come live with me instead.
01:17:15 So yeah, she basically leaves her friends in the dust by and large.
01:17:19 So you can see that, that issue.
01:17:20 And I did visit Nikki's hometown for like a couple of days and I
01:17:23 was hanging out with all of her friends because she really wanted
01:17:25 to introduce me to all of them.
01:17:27 And it's like, like, okay, you know, but obviously I don't make good
01:17:33 first or millions of impressions on people by and large.
01:17:36 So a lot of them were weirded out and wondering why she was into me.
01:17:39 You know, whatever.
01:17:40 Um, she literally Nikki could literally grabbed my phone at one
01:17:43 point and just started adding some of her friends without introducing
01:17:46 them to who I am.
01:17:47 And I'm like, uh, okay.
01:17:50 So yeah, you can see how this is sort of a powder keg to piss people off.
01:17:53 Right.
01:17:54 So I don't want to be too accusatory here, but basically, um, we were
01:17:57 in the car, me and Nikki sitting in the back and this, you know, the girl
01:18:00 in question, I'll call her acorn head because that's where her hairstyle
01:18:03 reminds me of sick.
01:18:05 She's driving.
01:18:06 I don't even think she was driving, but I think it was her car.
01:18:08 It was her CD, right?
01:18:10 Or she was playing like, yeah, it was her CD and, uh, drive by by train
01:18:14 was on the CD and I was just like muttering about how, oh, yeah.
01:18:17 I remember watching like a, I was just muttering to Nikki like, oh, yeah.
01:18:19 I remember watching a video by Todd in the shadows about how like the song
01:18:22 has like some of the worst lyrics possible.
01:18:24 Like if you really analyze it, lol.
01:18:25 And then like she put on this like rock cover of somebody I used to know
01:18:29 and I just muttered to Nikki like, Oh yeah.
01:18:31 You know, man, when this song is sort of isolated from its interesting
01:18:34 instrumentality, the lyrics are pretty, you know, average.
01:18:37 And so this was phrased to Nikki in the form of a Facebook chat message
01:18:42 as your boyfriend is belittling my musical tastes.
01:18:46 And I was like, I had this like this, this disconnect moment of, oh, right.
01:18:50 Not everyone is on the internet constantly talking opinions all the time.
01:18:56 I like had to really brain search to remember what the fuck I said
01:19:00 because I consider myself to, if I'm not on the internet,
01:19:02 reading random strangers, especially friends of someone important to me,
01:19:05 I'm going to keep myself pretty tight-lipped.
01:19:07 And indeed, I did just subconsciously.
01:19:10 She also put on a mixed tape of like early 2000s Disney pop songs.
01:19:15 And I didn't say shit because I never really thought about this as a policy
01:19:19 until I until I until I was faced with this issue with Acornhead.
01:19:23 But that that I was the result of this situation that I can fuck.
01:19:29 Okay, fine.
01:19:29 I'll we'll talk about musical taste insulting policies in another episode.
01:19:33 The point is, she was like, what the fuck is wrong with your boyfriend?
01:19:35 Right?
01:19:35 Because she was like blowing off Nikki like through texts and Nikki was like,
01:19:40 I'm so mad at Acornhead.
01:19:42 I want to like tell her to f off and like Nikki, calm down.
01:19:45 Let's just say, hey, you know, you're here.
01:19:47 You're there for her, right?
01:19:48 And just just be nice.
01:19:49 And she wants to tell her to f off.
01:19:51 That's some pretty strong language right there.
01:19:54 Yeah, I don't know why I censored that anyway.
01:19:56 So, um, so she just was like, hey, what's up?
01:20:00 You know, I don't know what's going on, but you know, let me know.
01:20:03 And then Acornhead was all like, oh, your boyfriend's such a dick.
01:20:05 You know, he always corrects people.
01:20:07 And I was like, wait, what?
01:20:08 And so apparently an instance of me correcting people is one of her friends
01:20:11 was like, I was playing this game on my phone and it was like one of those
01:20:15 things where like the camera was like out and it was like at an angle.
01:20:18 And I'm like, isometric.
01:20:20 And she was like, well, well, like it was like things were at an angle
01:20:23 and I'm like, isometric.
01:20:24 That was apparently really offensive.
01:20:26 You know, like I was trying to throttle my dickishness so hard,
01:20:29 but it's still enough of a came through.
01:20:31 Well, you know, a lot of that is just if they have a certain impression
01:20:33 of you already, you know, like it's a straw that breaks the game.
01:20:37 I already fucking represent like a tension, a new tension with their friends.
01:20:42 So I get it, right?
01:20:43 Exactly.
01:20:43 Um, but so yeah, you guys ever see that episode of Big Bang Theory
01:20:46 when Sheldon goes to the dinner party?
01:20:48 Unrelated question.
01:20:49 Just asking.
01:20:50 But yeah, so like their friendship was over for like a couple of weeks,
01:20:53 even though like I went back to, you know, back to my zone and Nikki was left,
01:20:57 you know, IRL friends with Acornhead and everyone else.
01:21:01 And so I was like, well, how are you going to like not be friends with someone
01:21:04 when you're in a densely connected web of friendship?
01:21:06 But cut to a few months later, now Nikki lives with me.
01:21:09 So now it's all online friends with her, right?
01:21:11 And what happens?
01:21:13 Oh man, we do something that really offends or really disappoints Acornhead.
01:21:17 So Nikki says we're going to get a hamster because like me and David
01:21:21 are going to live up in this room.
01:21:22 We're going to get a hamster and it's going to be so cool.
01:21:24 Who's David?
01:21:25 Yeah, I know, right?
01:21:26 Who the fuck is David?
01:21:27 I actually hear my real name more often than a username once now.
01:21:31 David's the hamster obviously.
01:21:33 Right, it's the hamster.
01:21:34 David the hamster.
01:21:37 So, so fucking, she even had the idea like I'm going to name the hamster Donut.
01:21:42 That's specifically what I'm going to call it.
01:21:44 She had like, she basically had visualized exactly what this hamster
01:21:47 is going to be before we even had it.
01:21:48 And Acornhead was like great hamster idea.
01:21:51 All you got to do is we like once you get a job, you save up some money.
01:21:54 You buy all that hamster equipment.
01:21:56 You buy yourself a hamster and Nikki was like, yeah, Acornhead.
01:21:58 I'm totally going to do that.
01:22:00 But then, you know, Nikki's laying around like before I think, yeah,
01:22:04 she was about to get a job actually.
01:22:06 It was just like a couple of weeks before she got called in, I think.
01:22:09 Um, she was about to get a job.
01:22:11 Uh, but like a few weeks before that, whoops, I'm fucked it up a bit.
01:22:14 It's a few weeks before.
01:22:15 Right.
01:22:15 Oh my God.
01:22:16 We're going back weeks.
01:22:17 Sorry, it's no big deal.
01:22:19 It was just seriously.
01:22:20 It was just one little clarification, right?
01:22:22 Okay.
01:22:22 She fucking, she was like, I want to get the hamster stuff now.
01:22:25 I'm like, okay, fine.
01:22:26 So I spent like a fair bit of money to get like a hamster cage and all the stuff.
01:22:31 And Nikki said, hey, she take my money.
01:22:36 So she said, Hey, Acornhead.
01:22:37 I got all this hamster equipment, snap a picture.
01:22:39 And Acornhead was like, Oh, dot, dot, dot.
01:22:43 And Nikki is like, what's going on?
01:22:44 Huh?
01:22:45 What's up?
01:22:45 And she's like, Oh, nothing.
01:22:47 I'm like, what?
01:22:48 And she's like, are you mad at me?
01:22:50 Acorn's like, no, not mad.
01:22:52 Just dot, dot, dot.
01:22:53 Disappointed.
01:22:54 Turns out, of course, the classic believe that she got dramatic ellipses
01:22:59 that your boyfriend is getting you a hamster before you got a job.
01:23:03 Right.
01:23:04 Oh man.
01:23:05 Your boyfriend is like spoiling you in the humanity.
01:23:08 Right.
01:23:08 Sounds like sounds like she's in need of a hamster.
01:23:10 Right.
01:23:11 Dude, now that we got the hamster hamsters are great.
01:23:14 I finally realized that there is a pet that is great because you know,
01:23:16 even cats are kind of, you know, they're not zero maintenance.
01:23:19 Hamsters are basically zero maintenance.
01:23:20 It's just like watching my every day.
01:23:23 Now every day is Hamtaro time.
01:23:24 And it's wonderful.
01:23:25 Hell yeah.
01:23:26 Finally, I have an animal I really like.
01:23:28 Tomorrow will be great too.
01:23:30 Hell yeah, Ben.
01:23:31 Hell yeah.
01:23:31 So it was definitely worth it.
01:23:32 But like Acorn had this frame.
01:23:34 This is like, Acorn had this framing this as like me like spoiling Nikki,
01:23:38 you know, like giving her too much stuff and like, you know,
01:23:40 again, Nikki wouldn't like let it go.
01:23:42 She'd be like, Hey, no, you shouldn't.
01:23:44 But, but Acorn had to be just like so offended that her life advice wasn't being
01:23:49 taken.
01:23:49 So here's where we get to the worthless part of the friendship here.
01:23:52 Is that Acorn had is was so like, it's just a couple of years older,
01:23:56 right?
01:23:57 And she sees herself as very mature and like independent and was just
01:24:01 in sense that Nikki was not quote listening to her life advice by virtue
01:24:06 of not just following all of it, you know, and, and she was just like,
01:24:10 and I even told Acorn had like, I gave her my own message like, Hey,
01:24:14 I mean, I decided to give Nikki the hamster because it would be a
01:24:16 responsibility.
01:24:17 Like, you know, she has to like feed it every day and she just needs
01:24:20 something to do while she looks for a job.
01:24:21 She's really bored, really depressed, waiting for a job to show up.
01:24:25 I'm giving her some more stuff to do, right?
01:24:27 And what she did was the classic internet technique of like pretending
01:24:30 to agree with that point so that they can then proceed to like completely
01:24:33 contradict you.
01:24:34 She was like, Oh, I totally get that.
01:24:35 But just wait.
01:24:36 She said, just wait until five years from now when she's still not doing
01:24:39 anything with her life and see if you still want to be with her.
01:24:42 And I was like, Jesus.
01:24:44 That's I see where she's going with that.
01:24:46 Sounds pretty zero to 60.
01:24:48 Yeah, yeah.
01:24:49 This person's got an agenda.
01:24:51 Yeah, I fucking know, right?
01:24:53 And so Nikki was so mad and then like, you know, like she was just browsing
01:24:57 Facebook a few days later and she saw a comic that reminded her of Acornhead
01:25:01 where it was like some it was like a little Facebook, you know, comic
01:25:04 strip thing of like, you know, certain guys went this out of a relationship
01:25:08 and like all the responses were like, oh, yeah, fuck those guys and fuck
01:25:10 those relationships.
01:25:11 Nikki was like, all these goddamn people telling me how to have my
01:25:15 relationship, you know, like, yeah.
01:25:18 And so she so she posted a reply to that thing saying, or you could just,
01:25:23 you know, let people have their own fucking relationships and live
01:25:26 their own goddamn lives by their own terms.
01:25:28 The problem is that she did not like, like nest the actual original image
01:25:33 because it was also like a fetish thing.
01:25:34 So she didn't want that to be on her post.
01:25:36 So she just out of context responded to something that wasn't there,
01:25:39 which was like the weirdest shit ever.
01:25:41 But it made Acornhead think it was directed completely at her because,
01:25:45 you know, she knows that there you go.
01:25:47 So Acornhead, this is fascinating.
01:25:49 This is like the tale of the snarky Facebook post.
01:25:52 Like the origin story.
01:25:53 This is like, uh, uh, yeah, Facebook post redemption.
01:25:57 Yeah.
01:25:57 So like he was all like, yeah, that that Facebook post wasn't directed
01:26:01 at her.
01:26:01 It wasn't about her.
01:26:02 Although emotionally it was about her, you know, but it wasn't directed
01:26:05 at her.
01:26:06 She didn't at message Acornhead, you know, at acornhead.twitter.com.
01:26:10 She did not message her, but Acornhead was like incensed about it and
01:26:13 wasn't talking to Nikki for a couple of days.
01:26:15 And she was like, why is she like blowing me off?
01:26:18 And she was like getting mad.
01:26:19 Like, I'm going to say F you Acornhead.
01:26:21 And I was like, Nikki, Nikki, Nikki, Nikki, Nikki calm down.
01:26:24 Just be there for her.
01:26:25 Just send her a message saying what's up.
01:26:28 Right.
01:26:29 And she was like, okay, fine.
01:26:30 So she wrote a message hit send message could not be sent.
01:26:35 Oh shit.
01:26:36 So after about 30 attempts to call her because I don't know.
01:26:39 Maybe Nikki is a little bit clingy.
01:26:41 Uh, she finds out through the grapevine that she has been Facebook
01:26:45 blocked by Acornhead Esquire.
01:26:47 The worst sin you can commit in today's age.
01:26:51 What a fucking shit.
01:26:52 Okay.
01:26:53 Yeah.
01:26:53 So, so now Nikki kind of goes like, no, cause Nikki has this sort of
01:26:59 this really difficult relationship of not being able to not respect Acornhead
01:27:04 for being, you know, an older girl who's gotten more accomplishments
01:27:08 and done more things with her life and acts like a know it all and
01:27:10 therefore like attain some authority.
01:27:12 You know, someone who Nikki has looked up to for a long period of time.
01:27:16 So it's hard to like reconcile the fact that she's actually kind of a bitch dick.
01:27:20 So it's, you know, kind of tears her up.
01:27:22 You're right.
01:27:23 And it was just like, eventually Acornhead responded with, yeah, fuck you
01:27:26 and your stupid messages.
01:27:28 Um, you're not, you're a terrible friend.
01:27:30 Um, I'm not going to be your friend anymore.
01:27:32 I don't want to see any more of you.
01:27:34 Oh, you're dumb.
01:27:35 And I thought it was pretty interesting to see, uh, to see Acornhead after
01:27:39 all of her like posturing of like how mature she is, like taking
01:27:42 her ball and going home, just the amount of spite that was like spread
01:27:46 onto me indirectly through Nikki is palpable in my soul.
01:27:49 This is a very recent thing.
01:27:50 That's why I'm going in through too many like unnecessary details
01:27:53 is because it's hard and I haven't had as much time to filter it out.
01:27:56 But, uh, but, uh, yeah, and, and eventually like her last message to
01:28:01 Nikki was, yeah, you know, um, you think you can live without me,
01:28:05 but when it all comes crashing down, you'll be sorry.
01:28:08 And I'm like, Jesus.
01:28:10 And, uh, yeah, that was that.
01:28:12 So that was a friend, you know, when you talk specifically
01:28:14 about worthlessness, it's a friend who felt that they were more
01:28:18 worthful than they are and couldn't deal with the fact that they're
01:28:22 fucking life advice and you know, this whole like hamster thing
01:28:24 was at the tip of the iceberg.
01:28:25 Sounds like someone who's willing to, who's willing to write
01:28:29 you off completely when you don't need them.
01:28:31 And like, like if you, if you're no longer dependent on them.
01:28:34 Yeah, exactly.
01:28:35 Exactly.
01:28:36 It was, it was very, yeah, it was pretty manipulative and controlling
01:28:39 in that kind of way.
01:28:40 And she was just, yeah, she was just getting herself into this,
01:28:42 the cycle of like acting more immature because she wasn't being
01:28:45 treated like the adult in the room, you know, and, uh, we see.
01:28:48 Yeah.
01:28:49 There's a lot of ways that you can be a worthless friend and a
01:28:52 lot of ways you can approach this from.
01:28:53 So, uh, yeah, that's interesting here for that perspective.
01:28:56 All right.
01:28:56 Well, we encourage you all to go out and try and experiment with
01:29:00 your own ways of being a worthless friend and let us know how it goes.
01:29:04 All right.
01:29:04 What's up, mate?
01:29:05 Yeah.
01:29:05 Just quickly while I was talking, I remember like the friend from my
01:29:08 last, uh, story, she, um, told her family, like, like, uh, she was
01:29:13 really good friends with her, like, um, cousins and stuff.
01:29:17 Uh, she, she told her cousins about me and during like one time while
01:29:21 we were friends, like we, you know, we had the on and off thing.
01:29:24 Uh, while we were friends, like her cousin came to visit and like in
01:29:28 the middle of like the neighborhood, I was just walking home.
01:29:30 The cousin just kind of like pointed to me and shouted across
01:29:33 the neighborhood, like, you can't like my cousin says, like, you're,
01:29:40 you're a terrible person.
01:29:42 And I was stunned.
01:29:44 I was stunned.
01:29:45 I was like, I never, I never talked to you.
01:29:47 You don't know anything about me.
01:29:48 She must have said really terrible things about me for you to go out
01:29:52 of your way to bully me in public like that.
01:29:55 And she was older as well.
01:29:56 She, we weren't like, we weren't like, and like the same age.
01:29:59 She was much older than me.
01:30:00 She was like, did you say sorry?
01:30:02 Yeah.
01:30:03 She was, did you say you cunt in Lithuanian in Lithuania?
01:30:06 She said something of equivalent.
01:30:08 Uh, I don't remember the exact words, but I knew it was like a swear word.
01:30:12 It was like approximately say something like that in major major.
01:30:17 Can't believe you remember the English translation better than what
01:30:19 was actually said in your native tongue.
01:30:22 She's living in the first things first, like Lithuanians don't
01:30:26 have swear words all their swear words that we use our Polish or Russian
01:30:29 or even English.
01:30:30 Oh, cool.
01:30:31 Yeah.
01:30:32 So we don't, we don't have swear just in our, that's, that's what I like.
01:30:34 A good clean language.
01:30:38 If we wanted to insult people, we would use animal words like, you
01:30:41 know, pig, uh, kurwa, rooster.
01:30:44 That, that's Polish.
01:30:46 And that's a swear word.
01:30:47 I know, I know.
01:30:49 That was fascinating.
01:30:50 I heard kurwa all the time.
01:30:51 Kurwa was the only, was like, was like, was the most, was the big thing over
01:30:57 there.
01:30:57 Um, I'm medical never, never at me.
01:31:00 Um, never from me because I'm a good boy.
01:31:03 Of course.
01:31:04 You didn't do nothing.
01:31:05 Never.
01:31:05 But yeah, just like my point is like, she should talk so badly about me to
01:31:10 her like close relatives where I, while we were friends, I never should
01:31:15 talked about her behind her back.
01:31:17 Like only time I would complain about her to our common friend who knew
01:31:21 how she was.
01:31:21 I wouldn't like, you know, poison new people to her like by, by, you know,
01:31:26 just, you know,
01:31:28 that was like, that was such a shocker.
01:31:29 And I just remembered it.
01:31:30 And like, there was also other ways how she mistreated me, but like this
01:31:34 podcast is a long enough for me to tell all the stories.
01:31:38 But yeah, she was, she was terrible.
01:31:40 Hey, what can you do, man?
01:31:41 Uh, sounds like she really was after control.
01:31:43 Friends are scary.
01:31:44 They can become enemies.
01:31:46 It's, it's true.
01:31:47 It's a role in life.
01:31:48 I like how like every, never have friends.
01:31:50 Everybody has a message.
01:31:51 Yeah.
01:31:52 All the friends I had, like in real life, just sort of like pissed off from my
01:31:55 life all at the same time.
01:31:57 When I was 16, 17, so they all left and you were the common element here.
01:32:02 Wonder if there's a.
01:32:05 Come on.
01:32:05 I don't know.
01:32:07 Fuck you.
01:32:11 I like, I like to believe I was meant for greater things.
01:32:15 Interesting.
01:32:16 Interesting.
01:32:17 That's what all sociopaths say.
01:32:18 Okay.
01:32:20 So this is the part of the show where we take questions from fans at home
01:32:24 on Twitter and on the private PCP discord for patrons only.
01:32:28 Hooray.
01:32:28 That's right.
01:32:29 That's right.
01:32:29 And if you patron, uh, you're more likely to get your question seen because we
01:32:32 got a whole bunch of Twitter ones.
01:32:33 It's a more exclusive club.
01:32:34 And for the first time ever, the entire, the entire PCP patron lounge came
01:32:40 together with one big question that they want us to debate.
01:32:44 Oh, God.
01:32:45 They've been having a debate about this all day and they wanted to get our
01:32:47 take on it.
01:32:49 What's the best kind of chocolate, dark chocolate, normal chocolate?
01:32:52 Oh, I have a very specific answer.
01:32:54 I like how it's called normal chocolate, not milk chocolate.
01:32:57 Well, sure.
01:32:57 That's true.
01:32:58 Of course it's not dark chocolate.
01:32:59 Of course it's dark.
01:33:00 Milk.
01:33:01 Does anyone not think it's dark chocolate?
01:33:02 It's not dark chocolate.
01:33:04 It's dark chocolate.
01:33:05 It's dark chocolate.
01:33:06 Milk chocolate.
01:33:08 No.
01:33:08 Okay.
01:33:08 So look, hang on.
01:33:09 Okay.
01:33:09 So, uh, who, how many people in favor of dark chocolate?
01:33:12 I.
01:33:12 I.
01:33:14 What?
01:33:14 Only two?
01:33:15 Is it genetic?
01:33:16 Is it a genetic disposition that we shared?
01:33:18 Who's, who's, who's for milk chocolate now?
01:33:21 Uh, I like white chocolate.
01:33:23 What?
01:33:23 And a white, what about DeVue?
01:33:25 And what does DeVue say?
01:33:25 Are we limited only to dark white and milk?
01:33:28 No.
01:33:28 No, you got another.
01:33:29 You can suggest it.
01:33:29 Yeah.
01:33:30 That was the question.
01:33:30 The kind that you get that are chocolate chips out of the bag that are meant for baking.
01:33:35 Those for some reason.
01:33:35 So baking.
01:33:36 That's not, that's not milk chocolate.
01:33:38 No, that's not sweet.
01:33:39 And it's dark chocolate.
01:33:40 Dude, I can't.
01:33:40 Are they sweetened?
01:33:41 Are they sweetened?
01:33:41 I don't know what to fucking tell you.
01:33:42 You can buy any kind of fucking Hershey's.
01:33:44 It's not going to taste quite like, uh, chocolate chips that you get out of a bag that are meant for cooking.
01:33:49 It's like, it's like this weird civilization where like everyone is doing the wrong thing
01:33:52 and I'm the main character who like looked to the side of the shelf and like found this other different path.
01:33:56 It leaves the secret society where there's the fucking completely way superior in every fucking way chocolate that people put in chocolate chips.
01:34:04 No, you don't need to buy it in chip form.
01:34:06 You can get it just normal.
01:34:08 Well, DeVue is making the case that it's not the same.
01:34:10 The taste is like like a Hershey's part.
01:34:12 Hershey's favorite flavor is a shape.
01:34:13 I'm going to tell you what, it's, it's dark.
01:34:15 It's semi, it's semi sweet and it's dark chocolate.
01:34:18 I'm sure.
01:34:18 You erased all memories of chocolate from me and you blindfolded me and had me eat a regular Hershey's bar.
01:34:24 I would be like, hmm, kind of tastes like I'm eating like a candle or something.
01:34:28 It kind of like, it almost tastes like some sort of like weird, like maybe chocolate that was like inside a can that was like sitting there for two weeks mixed with like a red candle or something.
01:34:36 Maybe some bugs flew into it.
01:34:38 That's what I think when I eat like Hershey's bars or Hershey's kisses, every kind of Hershey's thing.
01:34:42 But even Hershey's, the same exact fucking brand.
01:34:46 If you just buy the bags of chocolate chips that I'd see in my mom's jelly cupboard, I open it up, pour that into like just a little cup and just eat those like a snack while I'm 14 and don't have to worry about getting a fat belly of beer belly yet.
01:34:59 That was the only kind of chocolate that was really worth having.
01:35:01 And I'm just like, why, why, why is the world not like understanding this weird mistake we've all made?
01:35:06 We've all made this collective mistake.
01:35:09 Fair enough.
01:35:10 If we can pick random shit as our favorite chocolate, then peanut M&M's are the best chocolate ever made.
01:35:16 Okay, now we're just poisoning the well here, bringing in these candy coated shit.
01:35:19 What is the word?
01:35:20 You let the food do it, you fuck!
01:35:22 He's talking about a specific type of pure chocolate.
01:35:24 So much!
01:35:25 No, but the peanut M&M's got damn it.
01:35:27 The question is, the question is white milk, the question is white milk or dark.
01:35:32 Well, in white milk or dark, dark all the way.
01:35:34 Like I would rather like fucking eat like a celery stick than any kind of dark, any kind of chocolate other than dark.
01:35:39 People who prefer dark chocolate are also like wearing a fedora and like smoking a pipe.
01:35:43 Well, I'm literally doing one of those things right now and I'm gonna do the other later today.
01:35:51 Like I've been dark chocolate fans also like watch Rick and Morty every week and like do a podcast about it.
01:35:57 Disgust.
01:35:57 Rick and Morty?
01:35:58 You're not wrong.
01:35:59 My, I'll always have a place in my heart for cookies and cream Hershey bars.
01:36:04 Yeah, one of my chocolate.
01:36:06 That's not white chocolate.
01:36:07 I know that's not pure white chocolate.
01:36:09 That's a meme candy bar.
01:36:10 It's not, it's not in the running gear.
01:36:12 It doesn't taste good.
01:36:14 My mom will occasionally get this like hot pepper like dark chocolate, which just has like spiciness to it, which is kind of good.
01:36:20 But I gotta go with dark chocolate.
01:36:22 The answer is clear.
01:36:23 The consensus here is dark chocolate.
01:36:24 No.
01:36:25 There you go.
01:36:26 I disagree.
01:36:27 Facts are facts.
01:36:28 You disagree with the consensus.
01:36:29 This is math mage.
01:36:30 In general, I like fake chocolate like Atkins chocolate more than real chocolate.
01:36:33 Like even more than like fucking chocolate chip chocolate.
01:36:36 Because it doesn't make me feel like I just ate a bunch of sugar because I didn't.
01:36:39 It's a faker, but it's actually actually like a taste better.
01:36:42 That's why I like diet soda.
01:36:43 Like it might be just psychosomatic, but I just feel better about myself after drinking a diet soda.
01:36:48 I recently got super into zero water.
01:36:49 It's all the taste of fucking soda without feeling like I just, I'm about to fucking pass out, right?
01:36:53 But yeah, like fake chocolate.
01:36:55 I even like the taste.
01:36:56 It's not just the feeling afterwards.
01:36:57 It's got this like powdery texture to it that is just so much more even and smooth.
01:37:02 Then like, cause like chocolate chips.
01:37:04 Yes, they have an amazing taste, but they're so fucking intense that they kind of command my attention and I become numb to it.
01:37:09 You know?
01:37:10 So like, cause like, like chocolate chip cookies, for instance, I would say are not actually enjoyable to eat in the long run because they're so good.
01:37:17 What the fuck are you talking about?
01:37:19 How is there so no one ever let me finish my fucking sentence?
01:37:22 They always boo me before I can completely beat it.
01:37:28 Yeah, there's so many people here who boo.
01:37:30 When you eat one, you like, it's like so good that like now that you're done eating it, life sucks now.
01:37:37 So the only logical conclusion is to never stop eating them, which will become a thing you can never eat.
01:37:43 God damn it, are you stop gaslighting us on the definition of good brother fucker?
01:37:46 Are you actually here to argue that because the chocolate chip cookies are so good that it's so sad to stop eating them?
01:37:54 That it's not worth eating them in the first place, man.
01:37:56 But he loves eating dark chocolate, so it must taste like shit.
01:37:58 I don't know what to fucking tell you.
01:37:59 There are things I think taste even better than chocolate chip cookies, but they're just a certain kind of good that aren't the same problem.
01:38:05 I guess Davoo's making like the heroin arguments.
01:38:07 Like is heroin good?
01:38:08 I mean, kind of, it's kind of good, but when your whole life is wrecked because you've reached to by a peak of euphoria.
01:38:14 I don't know, hold on.
01:38:15 It's not just simply the level.
01:38:16 It's not a fucking DBZ power level here.
01:38:19 It's more of a complicated thing, right?
01:38:21 Because like for example, like-
01:38:22 My P-brain can understand this.
01:38:24 Yes, yes, fucking tortilla chips.
01:38:26 I have the same issue with them.
01:38:28 Because it's all about the fucking salt.
01:38:30 The beginning of every tortilla chip is great.
01:38:33 The end of every tortilla chip is all right.
01:38:35 And so the only way to continue the feedback loop is to keep doing more chips, right?
01:38:39 It's a clear science.
01:38:40 Like potato chips even fucking advertise themselves, can't put them down.
01:38:44 Like that's kind of like weird abusive marketing right there, abusive products.
01:38:49 It's that skinner box.
01:38:51 Right, yeah.
01:38:52 Every time you get the fucking shiny thing.
01:38:55 Like obviously with chips, the logic in science is very clear.
01:38:58 It's salt and then the salt gets absorbed and now you're dealing with a bunch of tasteless darts.
01:39:03 I don't know how the science works with chocolate chip cookies.
01:39:06 I don't understand why, but I can have something like say brownies with ice cream,
01:39:09 which I think I would write above chocolate chip cookies as in terms of taste.
01:39:13 But I feel more satisfied about that.
01:39:14 Please stop, I'm so hungry.
01:39:15 Okay, well you know what?
01:39:16 You know what?
01:39:17 I'd say dark chocolate chip cookies are better anyway.
01:39:19 So the question is settled.
01:39:20 Actually guys, I just realized I made a mistake.
01:39:23 The question actually said dark people, milk people.
01:39:26 Oh no, we've been racist this whole time.
01:39:30 What are the milk people?
01:39:32 Wait, is that like gay people?
01:39:33 Like the guy named the milk people?
01:39:35 It's the carthine.
01:39:36 It's the carthine are the milk people.
01:39:38 Wouldn't a milk person be a woman?
01:39:40 Oh shit, you're right.
01:39:41 They're the cows of people.
01:39:46 You're not wrong.
01:39:47 I guess I'm going to maintain my same answer from before,
01:39:49 which is that my favorite of the kinds,
01:39:50 the really small ones, you get in a bag.
01:39:55 Davoo sent me to have some jungle fever over here.
01:39:58 Yeah, I guess we do.
01:39:59 Yes, we do.
01:40:01 Should we move on to the next question?
01:40:03 I've got it right here lined up.
01:40:06 Okay, all right, there you go.
01:40:07 All right, here we go.
01:40:08 New question at Faye88son says or asks,
01:40:12 are you with or with not?
01:40:14 This is how they say it.
01:40:16 Are you with or with not designer babies?
01:40:19 Designer babies.
01:40:20 What does that mean?
01:40:21 What do you think, everybody?
01:40:22 So a designer baby is the idea of being able to genetically
01:40:25 engineer the type of baby you want,
01:40:27 and then you just, you know.
01:40:28 I think I've got to be against,
01:40:29 because lately I've been thinking about dog breeds
01:40:33 and about how fucked up it is that we've like fucked up
01:40:35 dogs so much with genetic engineering
01:40:37 and like turned them into mutants.
01:40:39 And I'm pretty sure it would be a bad idea
01:40:41 to start down that route with humans as well.
01:40:43 Well, Ben, let me just play devil's advocate
01:40:45 on the obvious points here,
01:40:46 but like wouldn't it be great though, Ben,
01:40:48 if we just engineered everyone to like
01:40:50 not have any chance of cancer and like have, you know,
01:40:53 I don't know, be tall and strong and muscly.
01:40:56 You know what, I was thinking,
01:40:58 I was thinking designer as in like purely aesthetic.
01:41:01 If we're talking about like disease resistance,
01:41:03 then I'm going to say.
01:41:04 Yeah, but like having a foreign amendment against aesthetics
01:41:07 is just, here's like talking about ideology, sure,
01:41:10 but let's go one layer down towards a little bit
01:41:12 more of practicality as to like what platforms,
01:41:16 no matter how noble, cannot possibly win.
01:41:19 Here's the thing, like because when Ben said it would be
01:41:22 difficult to go to start down that direction,
01:41:24 keyword I want to emphasize is start.
01:41:26 Similarly to like say cyber augmentation
01:41:29 and how some people say that it's kind of a stupid argument
01:41:31 because we already augment ourselves with things
01:41:33 that we wear or like put on our wrists.
01:41:35 It's like the same thing.
01:41:37 You are already putting into consideration
01:41:40 the design of your children if you make any decisions
01:41:43 about who you're going to mate with
01:41:45 based on what you want your children to be.
01:41:47 And if you choose to not drink alcohol during pregnancy,
01:41:50 you are making an effect.
01:41:51 It's just a very simple one.
01:41:52 It's a very simple, obvious, not complicated,
01:41:54 not morally gray yet series of decisions that you are making.
01:41:58 And if the decisions become really complicated,
01:42:02 every fucking forum argument is just going to go back down
01:42:05 to like, well, you already weren't drinking alcohol.
01:42:08 So like the people who are against this are hypocritical.
01:42:11 And I just don't think people are going to be able to like,
01:42:13 yeah, people, the people who are going to stand against it
01:42:15 just aren't going to be able to win.
01:42:16 Probably because all the people who are for it
01:42:18 are going to be like a lot stronger than them
01:42:20 and just kick their ass.
01:42:21 I agree, Davoo, that the, to say it's just bad on its face
01:42:25 is overly simplistic for a lot of reasons.
01:42:28 But like, I see that the biggest concern that I would have
01:42:31 is through the, like how good is the actual process?
01:42:34 Like are we saying in this example that we magically
01:42:36 have the ability to just, you know,
01:42:38 wizardly control whatever kind of way we want our kids
01:42:41 to come out and there won't be any side effects?
01:42:43 I'm thinking like that the real issue will be
01:42:45 the actual like tangible effects of monkeying around
01:42:48 with like a zygote's DNA and like trying to control it.
01:42:51 But yeah, I'm sorry, that's your word.
01:42:54 I know that's your people's word.
01:42:55 You fucker.
01:42:56 First PewDiePie and now you.
01:42:58 How can't you do this to me?
01:43:00 What I did want to say was that, so Star Trek,
01:43:04 totally sidestepped this question in what I would consider
01:43:07 a fairly cowardly way and it's that,
01:43:09 so the way that Star Trek addressed the question
01:43:11 of genetic engineering is, so even in the original Star Trek,
01:43:14 everyone knows Khan, you know, the famous Khan guy.
01:43:17 So he is a genetically engineered like super Ubermensch
01:43:20 and that's like, and it just made him like think that
01:43:24 like, okay, I am superior to everyone.
01:43:26 So I have carte blanche to just like rule the human race.
01:43:29 And there were a lot of guys like him and you know,
01:43:30 it caused a lot of bad things to happen
01:43:31 because he had that mentality.
01:43:33 But like, and so basically, and in Deep Space Nine,
01:43:36 there is another character who's also genetically enhanced,
01:43:38 but basically the whole thing is like, he's okay.
01:43:40 He happened to turn out okay.
01:43:41 But there's a bunch of other genetically enhanced people
01:43:43 who like got kind of fucked up during the process,
01:43:46 which I think is interesting and probably more realistic
01:43:48 to what will happen because, but the reason they got fucked up
01:43:51 is because the practice has been completely outlawed
01:43:55 to genetically engineered children throughout the galaxy.
01:43:58 Exactly.
01:43:59 And so like these people were fucked up because like,
01:44:01 they had like back room geneticists, like are the ones,
01:44:04 like it's really similar to like a back room abortion
01:44:06 that like can fuck up the mom and stuff.
01:44:08 Like that's the idea here.
01:44:09 And so like, of course in that process,
01:44:11 things get messed up.
01:44:12 A much better conceit would simply be that like,
01:44:13 well, we try, but it turns out we can't make people
01:44:15 that much better than we already can
01:44:16 because DNA is more complicated than we thought,
01:44:18 you know, like fucking, you know.
01:44:20 Yes.
01:44:21 They're trying to avoid the question of like,
01:44:22 okay, but what if we really do just start making every baby
01:44:25 like pretty much perfect as a campaign?
01:44:28 You see the Ubermensch.
01:44:29 They're not answering that question.
01:44:30 They're still getting fucking,
01:44:31 I'm actually like editing a fucking Hunter, Hunter thing.
01:44:33 I'm watching the Merrim versus Netero fight right now.
01:44:35 That fucking Ubermensch.
01:44:36 Well, that didn't work out too well for him.
01:44:38 But it probably would have worked out okay.
01:44:41 I mean, okay.
01:44:42 So like he was not a bad person.
01:44:44 He just had a big ego because everyone, you know,
01:44:46 fed it a lot and he had to kind of sort through it.
01:44:48 But like he did develop human emotions
01:44:50 and an appreciation for life.
01:44:51 He probably wouldn't have lost if he was like more than
01:44:54 like 15 days old and had like more life experience.
01:44:57 Yeah.
01:44:58 Like the only reason he lost is because the, you know,
01:45:00 people assumed he was going to be a huge problem for the world,
01:45:03 which he may or may not have eventually been.
01:45:05 You know, the ants did kill a lot of people,
01:45:07 but you know, he didn't really have control of that
01:45:09 from the start.
01:45:10 He was brought into this system.
01:45:11 So he himself, you know, maybe he would have fixed things
01:45:14 and like, you know, they basically just assassinated him
01:45:17 without finding out what he would eventually become.
01:45:19 He was only like a couple days or like a couple months old
01:45:22 at that point, you know?
01:45:23 Yeah.
01:45:24 God, I love this fucking discussion we just had like 20,
01:45:26 like 2% of people are gonna be like, yeah, that's good points.
01:45:29 20% of people would be like, you fucking spoilers.
01:45:31 And then the other people are like, they're fucking talking about it.
01:45:34 That's okay.
01:45:35 We don't need to get into that anymore.
01:45:36 So does anyone have like a strong stance against it
01:45:39 on any kind of moral level or is it all practical?
01:45:42 No.
01:45:44 Yeah.
01:45:45 Human life is there to be toyed with in my mind.
01:45:48 Okay.
01:45:49 I see a good question here, pretty heady one.
01:45:52 It's on the Twitter?
01:45:53 Yeah, it's on Twitter.
01:45:54 Okay.
01:45:55 PoraSailingGod asks, what does humanity deserve more?
01:45:58 Alien friendship by solving global warming for us
01:46:01 or punishing us with death for causing it?
01:46:04 Oh, wow.
01:46:05 Well, okay.
01:46:06 By killing us because we caused global warming that only hurts us?
01:46:10 What's...
01:46:11 I think what she's asking is, does humanity deserve to be,
01:46:15 should aliens step in and help us solve the issue
01:46:18 or should they destroy us?
01:46:20 Because we've caused this issue and we're too dangerous.
01:46:23 I think the destroy thing is a silly point.
01:46:26 I would not be on board with that.
01:46:28 I would be surprised if I personally was ever a huge fan of a sci-fi thing
01:46:31 where aliens did anything other than not give a single shit.
01:46:35 You guys are still relying on the atmosphere of the rock you grew out of?
01:46:39 Plebs?
01:46:40 Yeah.
01:46:41 Why would they even give a shit?
01:46:42 They're interdimensional travels.
01:46:43 I hope people realize the moment that we have faster than light travel,
01:46:46 fucking no one's gonna care about climates of planets.
01:46:50 Well, you know, we'll need to fix it.
01:46:52 Still gotta live on them.
01:46:53 Yeah, you gotta...
01:46:54 Sorry, you could live in a ship, I guess, but whatever.
01:46:56 People do better on planets.
01:46:58 Yeah, no.
01:46:59 I mean, I wouldn't really...
01:47:00 I mean, it'd be nice if the aliens fixed it
01:47:02 and then just like gave us the answers to these questions,
01:47:04 but I think humans will sort it out eventually.
01:47:07 I think we deserve the benefit of the doubt.
01:47:10 I agree.
01:47:11 What's her face from horror, he said?
01:47:12 Yeah, I could influence the weather,
01:47:14 but if you influence it just slightly in an artificial way,
01:47:17 it will basically cause apocalypse for hundreds of years.
01:47:20 Wait, Haruhi said that?
01:47:22 Oh, right.
01:47:23 The alien girl from it.
01:47:24 Oh, Yui.
01:47:25 No, not Yui.
01:47:26 Yuki, that's right.
01:47:28 Okay, the question of like, should we be wiped out for it?
01:47:32 I feel like that attitude is coming from this like,
01:47:35 because we have committed this sin against the planets.
01:47:39 Guys, the planet is a fucking rock.
01:47:41 It's not alive.
01:47:42 It has no personhood.
01:47:43 It is not like...
01:47:44 It is not deserving of moral concern outside of...
01:47:48 It is a habitat for...
01:47:49 And I don't even care about animals.
01:47:51 My standard of caring about something is
01:47:53 if it has like an intelligence that is worth preserving.
01:47:55 Some animals might qualify for that,
01:47:57 and definitely humans do.
01:47:58 But like, I don't feel bad for the fucking planets
01:48:01 or like wiping out bacteria.
01:48:03 Every day you're fucking alive.
01:48:04 You are murdering bacteria in your fucking gut.
01:48:06 That's no different from like,
01:48:08 burning down a fucking rainforest
01:48:09 and just like letting all the trees die.
01:48:11 All I care about is our environment.
01:48:13 That's all I care about.
01:48:14 Yeah, for our own sake.
01:48:15 Yeah, I mean, not to like pile on and be too much of a dick,
01:48:18 but hearing that question,
01:48:19 it reminds you of like my parents and their friends being like,
01:48:21 do you think that like America deserves to be destroyed by Satan
01:48:24 for all of its sins at this point?
01:48:26 I'm just like...
01:48:27 Okay.
01:48:28 Gotcha.
01:48:29 Oh, is this it done?
01:48:30 I mean, yes, but, you know...
01:48:35 All right.
01:48:37 How about this one?
01:48:38 Jade Murrow asks,
01:48:39 how much do you value being a jack of all trades
01:48:42 versus specializing in one craft?
01:48:44 Immensely.
01:48:46 So, because I feel that the two,
01:48:48 that the one field I have proven successful in videos
01:48:51 would not have been able to be,
01:48:53 if not for having a very specific mixture of skills.
01:48:56 Let me finish the question.
01:48:58 She goes on to say,
01:48:59 I mean, most crafts take more than one skill to do.
01:49:02 Right, yeah, exactly.
01:49:03 But like, it's all about the very specific mixture.
01:49:05 Like, you can have people with like,
01:49:07 mediocre to pretty good skills in certain things,
01:49:09 but if combined just right, they make something great.
01:49:12 And I would consider James Rolfe to be kind of in that camp.
01:49:14 Like, he's pretty good at writing,
01:49:16 he's pretty good at directing,
01:49:17 he's pretty good at editing,
01:49:18 he's pretty good at analysis,
01:49:19 and he's pretty good at filmmaking.
01:49:21 I think he's kind of like a mediocre to decent filmmaker,
01:49:24 but he would just happen to have the idea
01:49:26 to combine filmmaking and narrative with video game review
01:49:30 and created an all new like genre
01:49:32 that like revolutionized everything
01:49:34 and happens to still do it better than most people.
01:49:36 So it's like, you know.
01:49:37 The single most important invention of the last hundred years
01:49:39 was the induction of the video game nerd.
01:49:42 Yeah. The angry video game nerd.
01:49:43 Yeah, yeah, oh, absolutely.
01:49:44 The greatest creation of the last hundred years,
01:49:46 I would say, of course.
01:49:47 You know, we're like, you know, Andrew Hussey
01:49:49 taking pretty good art skills, great writing skills,
01:49:52 great work ethic skills,
01:49:53 and creating something that's spec'd perfectly to his abilities
01:49:57 and he made something amazing with it, right?
01:49:59 So, yeah, like to do videos,
01:50:01 to do videos like all around well,
01:50:03 you got to be pretty good at analysis,
01:50:05 you got to like understand writing,
01:50:06 you got to understand like visual flow,
01:50:08 you got to understand how to talk at least decently,
01:50:10 you got to have the privilege to afford all the equipment,
01:50:13 and yeah, you got to have like a thin array
01:50:16 of like a little bit of skills in many different fields
01:50:18 and if you don't have all of them, you're fucked.
01:50:20 That's true, that's true.
01:50:21 Yeah, this question,
01:50:23 this question highlights to me why it's important
01:50:26 not to like spend time like practicing to do a thing
01:50:30 by doing other things
01:50:31 and why the best practice for a thing is just to do it
01:50:34 because like, yeah, whether it's videos or comics
01:50:37 or anything you're wanting to do,
01:50:38 like yeah, it takes a set of skills to do a task well
01:50:42 and the only way you're going to like practice all of them
01:50:45 in the proportions that you need to know them
01:50:47 to get good at the particular thing
01:50:49 is to do that thing
01:50:50 because anything else is going to be imbalanced, you know?
01:50:53 Like if you're trying to draw a comic
01:50:55 and you just do like figure drawing,
01:50:57 like maybe you'll get good at drawing figures,
01:50:59 but like drawing comics, it involves more than that.
01:51:01 It's all about framing, about dialogue and pacing.
01:51:03 Like you're never going to be the best artist
01:51:05 because there's a thousand best artists.
01:51:08 So like if you want to be the best of something,
01:51:10 come up with an all new combination
01:51:12 that no one's even heard of.
01:51:14 So I would say the best thing to do is specialize.
01:51:18 Well, hey, is anyone?
01:51:20 I can hear it, I can hear it.
01:51:22 Okay, Davoo, cut out.
01:51:24 The best thing that you should specialize in one thing
01:51:27 and you should be, and thereby become good
01:51:30 at all the things needed to do that one thing.
01:51:32 But yeah, I think overall,
01:51:35 like specializing in one thing is the most important
01:51:37 because like you're only,
01:51:40 that's what makes you stand out.
01:51:42 You know, they say like do one thing and be the best at it.
01:51:44 If you're doing all kinds of different things,
01:51:46 you will never be the best at any of them.
01:51:48 And being the best is what it takes, you know?
01:51:50 Being the best at what you specifically are doing
01:51:53 is what it takes to, you know, stand out.
01:51:57 Agreed, agreed.
01:51:58 If you're doing, if you're mediocre
01:52:00 at a bunch of different things, it's normal in case.
01:52:02 And when you say the best of a thing,
01:52:04 a thing doesn't mean a whole medium.
01:52:05 It can mean a whole genre.
01:52:06 It can mean a very specific thing, you know?
01:52:08 Like if you are, if you have the same amount
01:52:10 of writing skills as a bunch of other people,
01:52:12 but you happen to know a whole lot about fucking hepatitis B,
01:52:17 then you could make the biggest, best hepatitis B novella series
01:52:21 that anyone, that all the preteens
01:52:23 are gonna go crazy for, right?
01:52:25 That's exactly what I mean.
01:52:27 Being the best at specifically the thing you're doing,
01:52:29 like even if it's like something real narrow.
01:52:31 You go on the internet, like here's my hepatitis B fucking OC.
01:52:34 Do not steal.
01:52:35 It's hepatitis B DC5.
01:52:36 Yeah, and you know, like the small but dedicated
01:52:39 hepatitis B fan base will go wild for it.
01:52:42 And that's what you want.
01:52:43 And your mascot, the hepatitis B,
01:52:45 Buzz Buzz will, you know, be on the internet
01:52:47 and take it by storm.
01:52:48 It'll be great.
01:52:49 Yeah.
01:52:50 You'll be like, oh man, you sure are lame.
01:52:52 What are you, a hepatitis C fan?
01:52:54 Well, we're better than those people.
01:52:57 Hey, here's a question that's totally relevant
01:52:59 to our podcast here from the Twitter at
01:53:02 M-I Cool Man, or Me Cool Man, says,
01:53:05 how do I make cool internet friends like you guys?
01:53:08 And the great thing I like about this
01:53:10 is it's not a question of like, how do I become your friend?
01:53:13 This man is looking to cultivate his own circle
01:53:15 of internet friends.
01:53:16 And I have advice for that.
01:53:18 I would say the best thing to do is just
01:53:20 find a community and get engaged with it
01:53:23 and identify the people who, you know,
01:53:26 are investing their own energy
01:53:28 and providing value to that group
01:53:30 and, you know, contribute to it in whatever way you can,
01:53:33 be it like a content creator or otherwise.
01:53:36 And identify the people who are worth your time.
01:53:38 Hang out with them.
01:53:39 Just talk with them.
01:53:40 It's inevitable that you get to know them
01:53:42 because you're both there investing your time
01:53:44 in the thing that you're doing.
01:53:45 And yeah.
01:53:46 The PCP, the procrastinators,
01:53:48 could not have been formed in any other environment
01:53:51 but broneism.
01:53:53 The MLP fandom like specifically facilitated
01:53:56 a sort of like, you know, hypothetical social structure
01:54:00 of like people running around like sort of an ecosystem
01:54:03 and there was this one little, one little like area
01:54:06 where a very specific type of cream
01:54:08 rose to a very specific type of top
01:54:10 where it was the brone analysis scene
01:54:12 where it was like there's just enough autism
01:54:15 flying around, just enough creativity
01:54:17 and just enough people who are lazy
01:54:19 to create this giant like, this giant field of people
01:54:22 who are idiots and bad, but like there was just enough
01:54:25 people who were actually good
01:54:27 that they were definitely going to find one another
01:54:30 and hit it off really well through this highly relatable
01:54:33 place that they're both in.
01:54:35 Yeah, agreed.
01:54:36 Yeah, that's the only way that the PCP could have been formed.
01:54:38 Like everything with like the kind of art that we do
01:54:40 all sort of being synchronized.
01:54:42 We were sort of all on the same page for a period.
01:54:44 I mean, I wasn't in it at the time, but I was following it
01:54:46 during the pony era and doing some pony stuff myself.
01:54:49 Like we sort of all got synchronized.
01:54:51 We all sort of like understood one another and sort of like,
01:54:53 yeah, we started similar projects in similar ways
01:54:55 for similar reasons and all imbued in ourselves
01:54:59 the extremely categorical elitism
01:55:02 over like the people around us because that was
01:55:04 what the brone analysis community was
01:55:06 where there was this just giant swath of people
01:55:09 who were utter shit to make you feel better
01:55:11 and superior about yourself.
01:55:12 And that's the attitude that we still have basically.
01:55:14 It's such a stigma against feeling superior to people.
01:55:17 But when you look at the landscape and you see that
01:55:19 you really just are superior.
01:55:21 Well, if that's not the right time to feel superior when it is.
01:55:24 Oh yeah, believe me.
01:55:25 If you're doing an art specifically something that you're like
01:55:27 it's like a new project, something you've never done before
01:55:29 and you might be really insecure about it.
01:55:31 You don't know if you're going to do good.
01:55:32 You know, obviously you need to like look up to those people
01:55:35 who have done it better than you're ever going to do
01:55:37 as like inspiration and like motivation
01:55:39 and like showing what you have to do to be successful.
01:55:42 But when you're actually in the trenches working on it
01:55:44 chipping away at the project, it's perfectly fine
01:55:46 to spend 90% of your time like dwelling over and over again
01:55:49 about all the people who are worse than you'll ever be.
01:55:52 To tell yourself no matter how much you fuck it up
01:55:54 you're not going to be as bad as them.
01:55:58 It's a beautiful thing.
01:56:00 I see another question I want to answer.
01:56:02 Sure.
01:56:03 From at underscore swagdude underscore
01:56:06 favorite black fictional character.
01:56:09 And I just was excited to see this question
01:56:11 because I definitely have an answer
01:56:13 and it is the guy with the afro in chromarty high.
01:56:17 Oh, he's like...
01:56:19 I guess he's black.
01:56:20 He's totally black.
01:56:22 I mean, there's a lot of indicators but he's not like that dark skin.
01:56:26 You know, he's really not.
01:56:27 He's just fucking looking at him.
01:56:29 He's definitely a black guy.
01:56:31 That's definitely what they're going for.
01:56:33 Well, yeah, exactly.
01:56:35 And he's great and the fact that he's great
01:56:37 doesn't have anything to do with him being black
01:56:39 but he happens to be.
01:56:41 And I fucking love chromarty high
01:56:43 and he is my favorite dude from that show.
01:56:47 I might be forgetting someone else right now
01:56:50 but the one that I really think of is princess tiata
01:56:52 from princess and the frog.
01:56:53 I legitimately love that character.
01:56:55 I think she's fantastic and she's also hot as hell.
01:56:58 So there you go.
01:56:59 My favorite is Nino.
01:57:05 I think the best black character is
01:57:07 Bobobo Bobobo from this anime
01:57:09 called...
01:57:16 If Bobobo is black, then this guy from
01:57:19 Chromarty High is definitely...
01:57:21 Because they basically look like the same...
01:57:23 Bobobo has a giant blonde afro.
01:57:25 This guy's got a giant regular afro.
01:57:27 If he has an afro, he's fucking black.
01:57:29 What is Nino talking about?
01:57:31 I cannot believe you have not seen Chromarty High.
01:57:33 You should absolutely watch it.
01:57:34 It's one of my favorite shows of all time.
01:57:36 Okay.
01:57:38 What about you, Mage?
01:57:40 I was thinking...
01:57:42 I haven't watched much of videos lately.
01:57:45 Uh-oh.
01:57:46 Uh-oh.
01:57:47 We've got...
01:57:48 No, no, wait.
01:57:50 Is it Jamal from black.com?
01:57:52 No.
01:57:54 I never finished, but I should probably get on that.
01:57:57 What's it called again?
01:57:59 The show...
01:58:01 Young Justice. There we go.
01:58:03 Aqualad or whatever.
01:58:05 Yeah, he was cool. I like that.
01:58:07 Wait, he can swim?
01:58:08 I never liked him.
01:58:09 He was shitty and not cool.
01:58:11 I'm sorry, I don't mean to undercut your choice.
01:58:15 Okay, other questions?
01:58:17 No, no more fucking questions.
01:58:19 I don't pay two hours.
01:58:21 Fair enough.
01:58:22 I want more.
01:58:23 Now we're done.
01:58:24 We don't get paid more if we make the episode longer.
