00:00:00 Click and click down the track. Welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast, everybody. Welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast, where we decide that The Pro Crastinators Podcast will be slaughtered or salvaged.
00:00:12 Don't you guys just hate it when you're crying while masturbating with your fucking claw hand that you've accumulated from just jacking off three times plus a day?
00:00:25 Thinking about your various classmates because they've worn a nerd girl t-shirt once? I do that all the time and it just sucks.
00:00:33 Come on, hand. Can't you keep up the heat? Get out of the kitchen. Cyborg hands for jack off two. Classmates go now, too.
00:00:42 You know, I read this book by Jordan Peterson. I don't like the Jews either.
00:00:51 Who are you quoting?
00:00:53 This is not PewDiePie. That's obviously PewDiePie.
00:00:57 You're a master of speech.
00:01:01 That's all I'll say is that you're a master of linguists and you're a master of impersonation.
00:01:06 Hey, how you say it, this is me, PewDiePie, haha, Brofius.
00:01:13 This is a Swedish accent. He's Swedish, right?
00:01:17 Yeah, but he's not like...
00:01:19 So he sounds exactly like the Swiss shit.
00:01:22 No, it wasn't. I was doing the Swiss chef accent.
00:01:24 Well, okay, as you can see, everybody, we got everybody here. We got PewDiePie here.
00:01:28 God, intros are so better. Intros are so better. I hate the cold intros. I love these valuable, like, productive intros we have.
00:01:37 I mean, I agree. I agree. But just for the sake of information, me, Bestie Boy is here, Hippocrite, Mage, Munchie, Ben.
00:01:44 There you go. That's who's here. Alright, moving along.
00:01:47 What's up, guys? You like Caramel Donson or what? Are we gonna Caramel Donson or what?
00:01:52 I like Caramel Donson constantly. Honestly, but listen to it constantly.
00:01:57 I was just saying to Munchie before we started that Munchie is a...
00:02:01 He literally embodies the soul, the departed spirit of the 2006 anime congoer.
00:02:07 It's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me. Niceest thing.
00:02:10 Ben and I would both know. We were there.
00:02:12 It was a special time in a boy's life.
00:02:14 You were around zero.
00:02:16 Imagine me in my Disgaea cosplay at Anime Boston 2000...
00:02:23 Was that guy's name? Serif, something?
00:02:26 He was the Serif.
00:02:28 He's the angel leader guy. I can't remember his name.
00:02:30 That might have just been his title was the Serif. His name was Master Something.
00:02:33 He had kind of like an English or a Swedish sounding name or something.
00:02:37 I'm gonna find this right now.
00:02:39 Master Something Son.
00:02:40 Lammington? Lammington.
00:02:41 Master Lammington, that's it. Yes, that's it.
00:02:43 Okay, got it. Flansboss.
00:02:44 Imagine me in my Master Lammington Disgaea cosplay at Anime Boston 2006 at a FreezePop concert.
00:02:52 Glomping hard to FreezePop on the dance floor.
00:02:56 I still have a special place in my heart for FreezePop.
00:02:59 Boston-based band, as it so happens, didn't even know that at the time, but it's true.
00:03:04 You have a connection to one of the PC Pimmers with a blankets concert at Anime Boston, right?
00:03:10 Question mark?
00:03:11 What the fuck are you talking about?
00:03:13 You're talking about the pillows, my dude. You're talking about the pillow.
00:03:15 Oh, the blanket.
00:03:16 Sorry, I don't know.
00:03:18 Unload a fucking blanket in your skull.
00:03:21 Yeah.
00:03:22 Wait, that won't be a problem.
00:03:24 It'll be a real wet blanket if you were to do that.
00:03:27 Hey, Munchy, recently I saw you did a little animation of a lateralist of RowdyFuckers Copkiller's fame
00:03:35 doing a funny dance that was similar to the Caramel Dancing.
00:03:38 I just wanted to ask you, why? What'd you do? Why do you think of that?
00:03:44 Well, the reason I did that is twofold.
00:03:48 Number one, I'm animating on the side now.
00:03:51 Now, guys, exclamation point, stop.
00:03:54 Also, I'm doing another thing that features Lateralist Heavy that I'm not going to speak about.
00:03:59 Don't get your hopes up, question mark.
00:04:01 Are you talking about Lateralist Heavy like TF2 Heavy, like big donut sandwich?
00:04:06 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:04:07 What's the thing going on?
00:04:08 Oh, yeah, yeah, believe me.
00:04:09 Okay.
00:04:10 Lateralist Heavy, a frame scout, a six-ton pyrogue, the list goes on.
00:04:16 That's a terrible lineup.
00:04:17 Wait, what's his face would be spilling?
00:04:18 I already have the lineup.
00:04:19 Camman is tracing.
00:04:20 Camman's spy, right?
00:04:22 No, okay, here's the thing. Crocs is Heavy.
00:04:25 I don't know the rest.
00:04:27 There you go.
00:04:28 It's not that easy, is it?
00:04:30 It's all there is to say.
00:04:31 Why do you ask? Just want to know what's going on?
00:04:33 No, I just thought it was a really nice little gif.
00:04:36 Yeah, if you're doing animation on the side, it's like...
00:04:40 Link it in the show notes. Let me see. I haven't seen it.
00:04:43 Okay, do that. It's in RFCK, but also...
00:04:47 Speaking of nice little animations, there's on the Gibb and Take channel, there was those
00:04:52 two combined little snippets of animation from the upcoming...
00:04:56 What is it? Reanimating project of...
00:05:00 Well, it's called Hashtag Rise Up.
00:05:02 Is that the name of the show?
00:05:03 No.
00:05:04 I think that's what it was, right?
00:05:06 Hashtag, dude.
00:05:08 Hashtag stand again.
00:05:09 Nate, are you looking at YouTube?
00:05:12 Are you looking at Ben Sainz's leftist Twitter feed?
00:05:16 Yeah, I might have confused the two.
00:05:18 Sorry, Gibb, please extrapolate.
00:05:20 It's like a little animation thing of...
00:05:22 Oh my god, 43 notifications.
00:05:24 Of from the Homestuck-esque, collide reanimation product.
00:05:29 My favorite flash, our favorite cliff flash.
00:05:31 Yeah, you know, I'm not like that big a fan of the flash for story reasons,
00:05:37 but parts of it are really cool and the music is pretty good.
00:05:40 And there's numerous reasons to do it outside of the flash itself.
00:05:44 I'm happy to be involved in a big collaborative project.
00:05:50 And more so than ever, you've made Arm Retrieval Canon 2 Homestuck.
00:05:54 Yes, that was my big goal, is to do one of the first scenes.
00:05:57 I didn't think you needed help with that.
00:05:59 Wait, is this an official What Pumpkin project?
00:06:02 No, it's just like a fan who said,
00:06:04 hey guys, let's reanimate collide for the 10th anniversary of Homestuck.
00:06:07 But I mean, Hussie gave up all rights to artistic control over Homestuck a long time ago.
00:06:12 When I disagreed with the direction he took the series in.
00:06:15 That's exactly correct, that's exactly correct.
00:06:17 Now the, what is it, the lunatics are running the asylum as it were.
00:06:25 Well, hey, yeah, go on, who's got something?
00:06:28 I got things, but go on.
00:06:30 Okay, okay, well I want to continue on what we were just talking about.
00:06:33 So, you started this animation kick hippo.
00:06:38 I know that you've also been animating other things.
00:06:42 I don't know if you've said them on the show question mark, but I don't want to dox you, you see.
00:06:46 Oh, no, no, I've mentioned that I'm working on the finale of Bail Jape.
00:06:51 That is the animation I'm doing.
00:06:54 So, you've been in a real fever, you've been in a real fever pitch for animating.
00:06:59 Yeah, I'm, you know, I'm dreaming of in-betweens at this point.
00:07:03 I'm just thinking, ah, yes, smooth and jumping and key frame cool mode.
00:07:09 Ah, I love it.
00:07:11 In-betweens, the trans people of animation, my favorite.
00:07:15 Well, yeah, literally transitioning from one key frame to the other.
00:07:19 Indeed.
00:07:20 I, again, myself have been doing stuff on the side for personal reasons.
00:07:26 And I just want to say that I kind of suspected this was the case.
00:07:33 But, like, I feel like animation is, like, speaks to me on a more fundamental level than any art that I do.
00:07:41 It really is something that I, like, appeals to me.
00:07:44 Like, just the busy work of doing in-between frames and, you know, just animating.
00:07:50 That is just an inherently fun process to me, to watch something come together
00:07:55 and just to be able to kind of almost zone out in a way.
00:07:58 Once you have your key frames and you've done all the thinking hard work,
00:08:01 then you can just fill it in, that's really, really hot.
00:08:04 You know what, you know what I think about that.
00:08:06 This is something, okay, because we recently finished all those big video projects
00:08:11 and I've gotten back to drawing more, I have been facing this prospect more
00:08:15 and remembering the weird contradiction.
00:08:19 I feel the same way about starting to draw.
00:08:23 Because, like, once you start drawing, it's fine.
00:08:26 But I feel the same way about doing that as I feel about sleeping and that it terrifies me.
00:08:32 Because, like, yes, because I'm afraid...
00:08:36 I know exactly what you mean.
00:08:37 I'm afraid to let my, to turn my brain off.
00:08:41 I'm like...
00:08:42 Oh!
00:08:43 Okay, that's a very different way.
00:08:46 Really? Okay.
00:08:47 Is this the whole, like, you don't know if you're the same person when you wake up, sort of thing?
00:08:53 No, not exactly. It's not rational like that.
00:08:56 It's just, I don't want to do it.
00:08:59 And I know when I start, like, why don't you,
00:09:02 and Hippo and Mage, do you feel this way when you're thinking about maybe starting drawing
00:09:07 and you're like, oh, but I don't want to start that, though,
00:09:11 because then I'll, like, I don't know.
00:09:13 I don't even know what it is.
00:09:16 You know, I think I might know where you're coming from.
00:09:19 It's like the prospect of, like, I think about this sometimes of, like,
00:09:26 getting started with something means I know that if I get going,
00:09:30 I will be doing it for a certain amount of time.
00:09:33 And I won't...
00:09:34 Mage, don't just jump in and interrupt the middle of a sentence.
00:09:38 Like the... fuck.
00:09:42 Yeah, where are you saying?
00:09:44 I don't know. I can't remember.
00:09:47 A way to go, Mage.
00:09:49 I'm trying. It's one of those things where, like, I can't fucking think of the word.
00:09:53 You know that thing where, like, you think of the word?
00:09:55 Guys, what was he saying? We were all listening.
00:09:57 I was too busy yelling at Mage. I can't remember.
00:10:00 Dude, this is a great podcast.
00:10:02 Okay, okay.
00:10:04 What was the question?
00:10:06 Ben, you feel like you don't want to start drawing.
00:10:10 I do that because you know that once you're in there,
00:10:15 anything that comes along that could potentially interrupt you
00:10:18 will piss you off more than it would otherwise would.
00:10:21 And you don't know whether your future is going to be completely, you know,
00:10:25 devoid of interruptions.
00:10:27 And you're like, I need to wait for the perfect time to start doing this thing
00:10:30 that will take hours.
00:10:32 Yeah, that's part of it.
00:10:35 It's like, oh, maybe I shouldn't do it now.
00:10:38 It's not so much that I'm worried about being upset, about being interrupted.
00:10:42 It's just like, does this feel like the ideal moment to start on this?
00:10:47 Am I in the perfect headspace to do this now?
00:10:51 Maybe I should just wait. Maybe I should just wait in a better time.
00:10:54 A better opportunity will come along, which is ridiculous.
00:10:57 I'm going to level with you. You've got a pebble in your brain,
00:11:00 and you've got to drink something to get rid of.
00:11:03 He's got a pebble for a brain, if anything.
00:11:05 You've got to drink some carbonated soda to wash that down,
00:11:09 some bang to wash that down, because that's an extremely terrible mindset to have.
00:11:13 And I have that too sometimes.
00:11:15 I'm not saying this is right. I'm just saying this is my problem.
00:11:20 I feel that way too sometimes.
00:11:22 And I know that the way to fix it is to push through it more often.
00:11:28 But because I wasn't drawing much for a while, now I've started doing it again.
00:11:31 I've been facing this.
00:11:33 And I know that the way to bust it is to keep doing it and keep resisting it.
00:11:38 And I'm still working through that for the time being.
00:11:43 But it's getting better.
00:11:45 For a while.
00:11:47 For me, it's not that I feel like I should wait for a better time,
00:11:53 or something's wrong and I should wait.
00:11:56 It's really just that I don't want to do it because I'm lazy.
00:12:00 It's partially that.
00:12:02 The things I usually do to get over that initial thing is have a small ritual.
00:12:09 If I'm slightly hungry or tired, I will go downstairs, get a cup of tea or a small snack,
00:12:18 eat that, drink that while listening to something or reading Twitter or Discord.
00:12:24 And once I'm done with the eating, then I start the work and I drink the tea.
00:12:30 Music makes me more productive.
00:12:34 It definitely does, and yet I never listen to it.
00:12:38 It's just not something I do.
00:12:41 When I do, the results are always good.
00:12:48 Lads, we've got to talk over each other a little bit less here.
00:12:54 We're getting all tangled up.
00:12:57 This is particularly...
00:12:59 No, that wasn't even directed at you, Meiji.
00:13:02 I think Meiji needs to learn to interrupt better.
00:13:06 Not more, but better.
00:13:09 I was trying to make a point because there are a lot of people that say,
00:13:14 Everyone, guys, I have something to say.
00:13:17 Make sure you just go in and interrupt.
00:13:19 I tried two times and you guys...
00:13:21 There's an arc to this.
00:13:23 You said it while we were talking.
00:13:26 Here's my strategy.
00:13:31 Let's compare strategies on how to talk over each other.
00:13:34 You guys don't pause. Where am I supposed to start talking?
00:13:38 You look at strategic gaps in the armor.
00:13:41 Right there, I found one.
00:13:43 You wait for a strategic moment.
00:13:46 You can do that.
00:13:48 The way that I create a strategic moment.
00:13:51 It's about creating opportunities.
00:13:54 It's about visualizing the future you want to see,
00:13:57 and then the universe will bring it to you.
00:14:00 Here's the thing.
00:14:02 I feel like I interrupt properly.
00:14:06 When I say, guys, I have something to say.
00:14:09 I usually try and find a moment.
00:14:12 I don't think you're just better served by saying...
00:14:15 Instead of saying those words, being like...
00:14:18 And then they will make space for you.
00:14:21 And then you just launch into it.
00:14:23 My strategy is that if I'm trying to say something
00:14:27 and someone else is talking and I want them to stop,
00:14:29 I will begin the first word.
00:14:31 I'll say the first syllable.
00:14:33 People feel the anticipation there.
00:14:36 And I'll just...
00:14:39 And I'll keep doing that until the person speaking notices
00:14:43 and it disrupts them.
00:14:45 And then eventually they will...
00:14:47 It's a psychological battle of wills.
00:14:49 Why do they do this? There's no time limit here.
00:14:51 It just lets the person speaking know
00:14:53 that something is going to interrupt them
00:14:55 and they better just accept that possible.
00:14:57 I'll tell you why.
00:14:59 On one hand, it's like...
00:15:01 If people are interrupting each other,
00:15:03 that means they have things to say.
00:15:05 All the other boys have a lot of things to say about this
00:15:07 and it's an interesting topic.
00:15:09 However, it would be more easy to follow
00:15:11 and more interesting if instead of just
00:15:13 spitting out...
00:15:15 We actually thought
00:15:17 for even narrate a millisecond
00:15:19 to construct our point more.
00:15:21 I'll tell you my reason.
00:15:23 There's an elaborate series of reasons as to why that's done.
00:15:25 I'll tell you the biggest one.
00:15:27 One is that the conversation,
00:15:29 if you don't seize the moment when you have something to say,
00:15:31 could just move on
00:15:33 and then your thought will no longer be appropriate.
00:15:35 And the other real thought I have
00:15:37 is I will literally just forget
00:15:39 what I was going to say.
00:15:41 Actually, right now, for the last five minutes,
00:15:43 I have had a thought on my frontal cortex
00:15:45 waiting to be ejaculated
00:15:47 into the conversation
00:15:49 and I'm waiting for a lull to go back
00:15:51 to a thing to say it. And I could lose it at any moment.
00:15:53 It's precarious balance
00:15:55 and my psyche could be disrupted.
00:15:57 But then you get the...
00:15:59 Is this good for you, Buntie?
00:16:01 Is this what you want?
00:16:03 Hey, can you hear this?
00:16:05 Hey, can you hear this gun shooting your head?
00:16:07 That thought not.
00:16:09 Thought not.
00:16:11 Got a silencer on it.
00:16:13 A pen and pencil might actually be the solution.
00:16:15 Or like a pen and paper.
00:16:17 Oh, wow.
00:16:19 Munchie solves world hunger yet again.
00:16:21 Just a snatch in a way.
00:16:23 A pen and paper, tabletop, RPG,
00:16:25 dungeon crawl with the PCP.
00:16:27 Bonus episode.
00:16:29 What a race is all I'm trying to say.
00:16:31 We can all say everything we want.
00:16:33 And this isn't me an anti-conversationalist.
00:16:37 You're not accepting the full reality
00:16:39 of the battleground
00:16:41 that any given conversation truly is.
00:16:43 No other podcast is like this.
00:16:45 By saying that there's no time limit,
00:16:47 that's ignoring the fact that conversations
00:16:49 can simply shift
00:16:51 and then you just don't have the chance to say your thought
00:16:53 on what the conversation was.
00:16:55 Conversations only shift when people want to change the conversation.
00:16:57 No, that's not true.
00:16:59 It just evolves organically, dude.
00:17:01 Unless the Russians collude
00:17:03 and force a change in the conversation.
00:17:05 There's definitely something to be said
00:17:07 with regards to letting people
00:17:09 speak
00:17:11 when they
00:17:13 need to get something out
00:17:15 of their chest.
00:17:17 But I totally see what Nate is saying
00:17:19 because a lot of the times
00:17:21 I have a thing
00:17:23 that I didn't anticipate the conversation
00:17:25 going this way, but now I have something
00:17:27 to talk about this thing.
00:17:29 I haven't written it down.
00:17:31 And I don't know how to use a pencil,
00:17:33 so I'm just gonna forget about it.
00:17:35 I was surprised.
00:17:37 Not everyone agreed with me in the comments last episode,
00:17:39 but there were quite a few people
00:17:41 who were like, I like that
00:17:43 being a little bit of a clusterfuck.
00:17:45 I like a little bit of people interrupting each other.
00:17:47 Let the pod just let it be what it is.
00:17:49 And I was like, I'm glad I'm not the only one
00:17:51 that sees it that way.
00:17:53 And let me defend myself.
00:17:55 I am the first person to admit that I like
00:17:57 how frantic the PCP is sometimes.
00:17:59 I'm not saying it has to be another
00:18:01 boilerplate podcast.
00:18:03 Everyone just waits their turn
00:18:05 and just speaks only when they are
00:18:07 called upon or highlighted.
00:18:09 Why did I think that the phrase you were about to use
00:18:11 was boilerplate apocalypse?
00:18:13 I don't know.
00:18:15 However, I think
00:18:17 there's a balance here.
00:18:19 Moderation and all things.
00:18:21 I think there's a time and a place for clusterfucks
00:18:23 which could be even often.
00:18:25 And the time is now.
00:18:27 Okay, let's do it.
00:18:29 Hey guys, it's me on the podcast.
00:18:31 Don't interrupt me, please.
00:18:33 Wow, that was a great joke
00:18:35 and I'm glad everyone committed to it.
00:18:37 I didn't have anything to say.
00:18:39 That was awful.
00:18:41 What were you saying?
00:18:43 Art is shit and I'm glad
00:18:45 I'm not doing it anymore.
00:18:47 Hey guys, I just want to let you know
00:18:49 that I'm retiring from the podcast.
00:18:51 I made enough money. I can live for the rest of my life.
00:18:53 That's fair. We all can.
00:18:55 But we are greedy.
00:18:57 We want to steal the money from the poor
00:18:59 by continuing to make the podcast.
00:19:01 No, it can't happen. We were having a great conversation
00:19:03 and now it's back to the shit.
00:19:05 Guys, dammit.
00:19:07 Please support my empire at patreon.com.
00:19:09 I'd really appreciate that if you just keep sucking up
00:19:11 by vacuum on the poor.
00:19:13 Just giving it straight to my bank account.
00:19:15 My personal goal is to
00:19:17 make a living in a way as opposite
00:19:19 to my personal and political beliefs
00:19:21 as possible.
00:19:23 I thought you were going to say
00:19:25 as opposite to Nate as possible.
00:19:27 I just want to let you know
00:19:29 that I'm extremely suspicious of you right now
00:19:31 because you said something
00:19:33 which hurt me
00:19:35 deep in my arteries.
00:19:37 You said you check Twitter
00:19:39 when you get your T.
00:19:41 On what device are you checking Twitter?
00:19:43 What do you mean?
00:19:45 On my computer?
00:19:47 I think that's a pretty straightforward question.
00:19:49 Stop dodging the question.
00:19:51 Wrong answer, dude.
00:19:53 I don't understand.
00:19:55 He's showing weakness. Get him.
00:19:57 Everyone talk plow.
00:19:59 In my head, I envisioned you
00:20:01 walking downstairs and drinking tea.
00:20:03 But I guess the next sense,
00:20:05 if you were on your phone using Twitter,
00:20:07 I would have said tisk tisk, not strongly.
00:20:09 Oh, no, no. That's not on my phone.
00:20:11 Okay, I'm glad.
00:20:13 I have also...
00:20:15 You see, I'm following your footsteps.
00:20:17 You're a big daddy to me,
00:20:19 and I would appreciate if your cock could come out soon
00:20:21 rather than later.
00:20:23 Because my phone is basically
00:20:25 not connected to the internet whatsoever anymore.
00:20:27 No social media, no YouTube.
00:20:29 No fucking web browser.
00:20:31 Literally no web browser.
00:20:33 It's gone.
00:20:35 I have not...
00:20:37 I don't even look at my phone anymore.
00:20:39 Just because it's a piece of shit.
00:20:41 Well, I mean, it's not
00:20:43 aspirational. It's because
00:20:45 the thing is just really old and stuff.
00:20:47 Ben's truly stumbled ass backwards
00:20:49 into the perfect lifestyle.
00:20:51 It's not, because anything that I would
00:20:53 be wasting time on looking at my phone,
00:20:55 I just look at it on my desktop instead.
00:20:57 No, I'm not aspirational
00:20:59 in this regard.
00:21:01 Or any regard.
00:21:03 I'll fucking kill you, dude.
00:21:05 A couple of days ago,
00:21:07 I wanted to get really serious
00:21:09 about my phone
00:21:11 chewing up time, because I have had
00:21:13 the social media stuff off my phone
00:21:15 for a while now.
00:21:17 When I delete Twitter from my phone,
00:21:19 I just basically stopped using Twitter
00:21:21 altogether. I don't even know
00:21:23 the last time I looked at my Twitter.
00:21:25 I have no fucking clue.
00:21:27 Other social media stuff also falling off the map
00:21:29 as well as Discord. I have a mobile account now.
00:21:31 That's been for a while now,
00:21:33 but I finally took a big plunge
00:21:35 and just basically deleted everything
00:21:37 off my phone that was not
00:21:39 inherently work or
00:21:41 communications related.
00:21:43 That's fine.
00:21:45 I only have one screen on my phone
00:21:47 and it's all just like writing apps.
00:21:49 I'll just write apps or
00:21:51 my default music player
00:21:53 and that's basically it.
00:21:55 It's just a brick.
00:21:57 It's a brick of
00:21:59 pure writing and it feels
00:22:01 so good to be liberated from the
00:22:03 distractions that come with your phone.
00:22:05 Not only that,
00:22:07 I've turned it into a pure
00:22:09 work beast.
00:22:11 Finally, for the first time in my fucking life
00:22:13 gotten
00:22:15 a to-do app,
00:22:17 a task app
00:22:19 and a schedule for myself.
00:22:21 I finally have
00:22:23 a bedtime
00:22:25 where I'm going to bed at a single time
00:22:27 and I'm waking up at a single time
00:22:29 every single day.
00:22:31 Don't embrace this meme of this Digi Bro lifestyle
00:22:33 which I'm sure he would agree with as well.
00:22:35 Having a set time to go to bed and wake up
00:22:37 is just good for you.
00:22:39 I'm pretty sure
00:22:41 because you have an internal clock.
00:22:43 When you wake up
00:22:45 you don't feel like you want to die for two hours.
00:22:47 Imagine that.
00:22:49 So I'm
00:22:51 trying to go to bed at the same time every day.
00:22:53 Oh and big thing,
00:22:55 I have a journal now.
00:22:57 I had a journal before but I was not sticking to it.
00:22:59 Now I have a convenient app
00:23:01 called
00:23:03 Day Leo
00:23:05 and it is just a small
00:23:07 app that reminds you
00:23:09 every day at a certain time
00:23:11 to write about your day
00:23:13 which is what I've been doing every single day for a while now
00:23:15 and it's extremely helpful for my memory.
00:23:17 That's cool.
00:23:19 It's really nice so I've locked down my phone
00:23:21 and it's really great.
00:23:23 I'm really happy about it.
00:23:25 Is it something that you like?
00:23:27 I mean
00:23:29 I had my journal
00:23:31 that I would bring on holidays and stuff
00:23:33 to record events.
00:23:35 Sometimes
00:23:37 the day was so full of stuff
00:23:39 and by the time I remembered that I should write my journal
00:23:41 I was so tired I was just like
00:23:43 I don't know what to say.
00:23:45 I want it to be like a thing I can come back to
00:23:47 so I don't want to just write nothing.
00:23:49 Ironically
00:23:51 those are the days you need it most, right?
00:23:53 I've had that all the time.
00:23:55 I had a physical journal
00:23:57 and I use it.
00:23:59 But I have a physical journal
00:24:01 that I would have that exact same
00:24:03 scenario.
00:24:05 I would try and write every day
00:24:07 even when I was not on trips
00:24:09 and it just would fall through.
00:24:11 I just couldn't keep it up.
00:24:13 I would do it for the first couple days of a trip
00:24:15 and then it would be like I did so much today
00:24:17 I'm just fucking tired. I don't want to do this.
00:24:19 I hate writing by hand.
00:24:21 It's just a fucking nightmare.
00:24:23 However, with this
00:24:25 app, it's specifically incentivized
00:24:27 for you to write short sentences.
00:24:29 For instance,
00:24:31 yesterday...
00:24:33 It's like Twitter but only you can read it.
00:24:35 Literally yes.
00:24:37 Literally yes. It's like for that
00:24:39 basically.
00:24:41 There was a...
00:24:43 So you just at least have a record of what you did
00:24:45 the previous day.
00:24:47 And when I have something more interesting to say
00:24:49 that's when I break out the journal.
00:24:51 So I have a system here. It's every single day
00:24:53 and then when I have something more interesting
00:24:55 to write about and I have the free time
00:24:57 to do so, I'll break out my journal.
00:24:59 And that means it's not like a commitment
00:25:01 that I feel bad about breaking
00:25:03 that is writing in the physical journal.
00:25:05 It's just like a...
00:25:07 Whatever I break out the journal, it's just non-stop
00:25:09 good interesting things that I've chosen
00:25:11 to write about and therefore it feels more
00:25:13 important and better.
00:25:15 The Penny Arcade guys had a little inside joke
00:25:17 running for a while
00:25:19 about an app called Twonter
00:25:21 which is just Twitter, but instead
00:25:23 of posting your tweet, it just doesn't go
00:25:25 anywhere and nobody sees it.
00:25:27 It's like you get the satisfaction
00:25:29 of making an angry tweet with none
00:25:31 of the fallout or problems that come from it.
00:25:33 It would be a good system.
00:25:35 Everyone should get that and send
00:25:37 everything they want to send on Twitter on
00:25:39 Twonter first, see how they feel
00:25:41 about it and then decide if they want to
00:25:43 re-send it. Yeah, come back the next day.
00:25:45 Yeah. Do I want to tweet my...
00:25:47 No, the answer is always
00:25:49 the answer is always no.
00:25:51 Sometimes I go on Twitter
00:25:53 and I'm like, well
00:25:55 let's try and think of something
00:25:57 to say. Let's try and think of something funny.
00:25:59 Usually it just results
00:26:01 in me saying something stupid, but you know
00:26:03 whatever, but I shouldn't
00:26:05 feel the need to post anything
00:26:07 if I don't feel like there's
00:26:09 anything to say and yet there I go
00:26:11 trying to...
00:26:13 The most recent one was like Jimmy
00:26:15 Neutron meets Jimmy Page.
00:26:17 I was like, I mean it's kind of funny
00:26:19 but like I only did that because
00:26:21 I was on Twitter and I was like, I should probably
00:26:23 tweet something. It's been a while, it's been
00:26:25 a few days.
00:26:27 It's kind of stupid.
00:26:29 It's just so boring, honestly.
00:26:31 After a while it just becomes like
00:26:33 do I really want to know
00:26:35 what everyone else is saying?
00:26:37 Not in the sense that I'm antisocial, but like
00:26:39 I've known everyone I'm following
00:26:41 for so long, like I know
00:26:43 what they're going to say, it's just going to be more
00:26:45 bullshit.
00:26:47 Nothing's new there.
00:26:49 I'm not getting any new stimuli.
00:26:51 It's just keeping up with people
00:26:53 it's keeping up with you guys
00:26:55 exclusively. I've been getting
00:26:57 new stimuli from Twitter.
00:26:59 I've been having a great time
00:27:01 tweeting about what a lefty
00:27:03 I am and getting
00:27:05 people mad.
00:27:07 People aren't fucking argue with me.
00:27:09 On that subject Ben, I just want to let you know this is no disrespect
00:27:11 but I find that so
00:27:13 tasteful that I just have muted you
00:27:15 and have no interest. You've muted me?
00:27:17 I had no choice Ben. You've muted me because
00:27:19 I made like six tweets in the past week
00:27:21 are you kidding me?
00:27:23 Ben, okay here's the thing, maybe you should blame Twitter
00:27:25 because for some reason at the top
00:27:27 of my feed out of chronological order
00:27:29 it just kept showing
00:27:31 like one of your particularly
00:27:33 political tweets and I was like well I don't want
00:27:35 to deal with this, what are my options here?
00:27:37 I make one every like two days
00:27:39 one every two days for the last week
00:27:41 or so. That's a completely valid
00:27:43 move Nate. I haven't done it to Ben just because
00:27:45 I haven't done it to Twitter. I do not apologize
00:27:47 at all. I'll mute whoever the fuck I want
00:27:49 anytime. Twitter is for my fun and
00:27:51 enjoyment so I make no apologies
00:27:53 but that's the thing. But Twitter is not fun
00:27:55 I agree with my sheet
00:27:57 but it's not a good time. I disagree Ben.
00:27:59 I go there to have a bad time and make sure everyone else
00:28:01 is having a bad time too.
00:28:03 For me, who I follow on Twitter
00:28:05 is a bunch of people I generally like
00:28:07 not everybody 100% like people like
00:28:09 all of you who I like basically everything
00:28:11 you do and I retweet a lot of it because it's fun
00:28:13 and good and I like people to see it
00:28:15 and then also like anime cat girl bots
00:28:17 these are the things I follow
00:28:19 and they bring me such joy
00:28:21 and so Twitter for the me is mostly just a great
00:28:23 time and you know what
00:28:25 maybe I'm just not the right audience
00:28:27 I'm just saying this is a consequence
00:28:29 of the you know
00:28:31 of the political spin here. The main thing
00:28:33 I think of when I'm like should I delete
00:28:35 Twitter? Probably not
00:28:37 is that I follow a few artists
00:28:39 and I like when I see good art
00:28:41 and I want to share it with the people who follow me
00:28:43 and
00:28:45 it's like you know it's a nice feeling
00:28:47 to share someone's art when it's good
00:28:49 and to just see
00:28:51 oh there's a new Jade Maraud tweet
00:28:53 I like her stuff every time
00:28:55 but I don't see it posted anywhere else
00:28:57 and I don't really follow her in other places
00:28:59 so I'm like
00:29:01 I don't know
00:29:03 it's convenient enough
00:29:05 to keep around
00:29:07 I think I maybe should just unfollow
00:29:09 everyone who says words
00:29:11 I mean kind of
00:29:13 and I know that I too do this
00:29:15 so I would not blame people
00:29:17 if people just don't want to hear me say any thoughts
00:29:19 I totally get it and I would say then yeah
00:29:21 absolutely unfollow
00:29:23 whatever it's not a pure just fun
00:29:25 time all the time
00:29:27 Honestly I think a lot of my
00:29:29 disfun comes from
00:29:31 very structural foundation
00:29:33 things about Twitter
00:29:35 I'm thinking right now what if I had a Twitter
00:29:37 that was just
00:29:39 literally all images
00:29:41 and they were all drawing some artists that I liked
00:29:43 and I'm imagining on that white
00:29:45 Twitter page just scrolling down
00:29:47 and I just can't help but think
00:29:49 I would still feel terrible
00:29:51 using the light theme
00:29:53 what is the light motif
00:29:55 yeah something like that
00:29:57 I think I switched to dark but whatever it doesn't even matter
00:29:59 I would still feel bad
00:30:01 because I just don't want to just
00:30:03 it just feels unproductive
00:30:05 it feels like even
00:30:07 more terrible than like watching
00:30:09 something
00:30:11 it feels like
00:30:13 you're doing cookie clicker
00:30:15 but if you get more cookies
00:30:17 you get internet cookies
00:30:19 I mean at this point
00:30:21 watching an anime
00:30:23 for example for me feels like
00:30:25 homework
00:30:27 for me I'd just rather read a manga
00:30:29 because it goes way faster and feels like less of an obligation
00:30:31 I feel like Twitter is like a similar
00:30:33 sort of thing that it's just like
00:30:35 it's one level easier
00:30:37 than like now we have all the media we can consume
00:30:39 infinitely at our fingertips
00:30:41 but like Twitter's faster, Twitter's like easier
00:30:43 let's just go there, that'll be like more
00:30:45 you know fast results
00:30:47 to my brain stimulus
00:30:49 I just hate scrolling down, not in like a physical way
00:30:51 like I just don't want to scroll
00:30:53 but it just makes me feel like
00:30:55 I'm a fucking soulless automaton
00:30:57 well look, I hear you
00:30:59 I still think there are good things
00:31:01 for example, shout out to
00:31:03 Ukrainiansagok at black
00:31:05 s-e-a-a-m-s
00:31:07 something like that, I just posted a link
00:31:09 to a thing, Ukrainian, yeah
00:31:11 look at the disgusting gross audio links
00:31:13 just look at this one tweet, just says enormous
00:31:15 and it's an old school anime
00:31:17 robot guy just oozing power
00:31:19 this is what I like to see
00:31:21 this falls into my anime cat robot group
00:31:23 it's just lovely old anime
00:31:25 images that he posts screencaps of all the time
00:31:27 and it just brings me a little bit of joy to see
00:31:29 this is what I like Twitter for
00:31:31 to see shit like this
00:31:33 he posts stuff like that
00:31:35 in the discords that
00:31:37 I'm in, that he's in
00:31:39 so like
00:31:41 I don't know, I mean it's good for me
00:31:43 it means I don't need to follow him on Twitter
00:31:45 I can ask him, like hey
00:31:47 send me some funny things and he'll do it
00:31:49 I just, I just
00:31:51 I'm just over here saying
00:31:53 I started first, I'm just over here
00:31:55 I want to quickly say I'm just over here
00:31:57 I'm going, I'm going
00:31:59 yeah I have to, I have to, I'm sorry
00:32:01 I need to go, it's okay though
00:32:03 just sorry for
00:32:05 pay docked, you gotta pay
00:32:07 understood, say why
00:32:09 why you gotta go, what the fuck
00:32:11 I gotta go, I did say in it
00:32:13 I don't mind not getting paid, it's fine
00:32:15 it's okay, have fun guys
00:32:17 later
00:32:19 is it private, you can just go, okay
00:32:21 alright
00:32:23 do we bully her too much, I'm so sorry
00:32:25 I don't think so, I hope not
00:32:27 I hope not
00:32:29 well whatever
00:32:31 triggered by Twitter
00:32:33 well I guess, you know
00:32:35 Twitter is lame, art is lame
00:32:37 I hate images, I hate going on Twitter
00:32:39 and seeing images that I like
00:32:41 I am having a great time
00:32:43 I'm having a great time
00:32:45 going on there
00:32:47 saying an opinion
00:32:49 and having people be
00:32:51 and having an outpouring of yes
00:32:53 I agree with this and I hate you
00:32:55 you're an idiot for thinking this
00:32:57 that is stimulating to me
00:32:59 maybe I'm just weak, but I don't get much joy out of that
00:33:01 I don't know
00:33:03 I don't think it's like a strength to enjoy
00:33:05 indulging in stupid
00:33:07 shit
00:33:09 it's not stupid shit, it's about
00:33:11 saving the world
00:33:13 one tweet at a time
00:33:15 just manipulate people with your comics
00:33:17 that's the best way to do it
00:33:19 I do think that's the best way to do it
00:33:21 to package an ideology in some
00:33:23 consumable media, I think is pretty effective
00:33:25 alright, that's fair
00:33:27 I'm scrolling down and it's literally all in Japanese
00:33:29 and all the images that I like and I'm still unhappy
00:33:31 well that's why I'm bummed
00:33:33 that's why I'm bummed that you've muted me
00:33:35 because now that I am drawing comic pages again
00:33:37 and every time I finish a page
00:33:39 I tweet like, hey it's on the Patreon
00:33:41 new page up early
00:33:43 for patrons at patreon.com
00:33:45 that's true
00:33:47 I don't know, I'm sure I'll get you back
00:33:49 frankly you're one of my favorite people to follow
00:33:51 historically, but I don't know
00:33:53 I pretty much like all your shit
00:33:55 as has been, I've been pretty vocal on
00:33:57 but whatever, I mean you're not like some of these other people
00:33:59 who have just always been annoying
00:34:01 shout out to my boy
00:34:03 what's his name? Econ
00:34:05 an eternal mute
00:34:07 if there ever was one
00:34:09 but uh
00:34:11 I like
00:34:13 I know, but I have muted him historically
00:34:15 a couple times because he will go on some
00:34:17 tears, he will go on some
00:34:19 tweets, he will go on some tweet rampages
00:34:21 indeed, from time to time
00:34:23 what, Munchy?
00:34:25 number one
00:34:27 what do I call myself as a
00:34:29 binhead patreon bin saint fan?
00:34:31 I think a saint head
00:34:33 I think bin head rolls off the tongue better
00:34:35 I think saint head
00:34:37 I like the sound of it better
00:34:39 personally
00:34:41 I'm a clergy member, that's more thematic and funny
00:34:43 as opposed to saint head
00:34:45 what about a victim of
00:34:47 pre-sexual molestation
00:34:49 I don't know
00:34:51 also totally unsubstantiated
00:34:53 also, by the way
00:34:55 so
00:34:57 as a saint head
00:34:59 I always see
00:35:01 vapor's pages
00:35:03 posted and emailed to me
00:35:05 I could update from patreon and be like
00:35:07 hey, here's a new page and I always check them out
00:35:09 but I have to wonder
00:35:11 why aren't you putting them on your website
00:35:13 so normal people can see them
00:35:15 and you get bigger
00:35:17 let me speak
00:35:19 for the voices of the non-patrons
00:35:21 I've never patroned anyone in my life, I speak for the normos here
00:35:23 and
00:35:25 it's true, but I see you post
00:35:27 all the time, or maybe more in the past
00:35:29 but whatever, I see you post like, hey, new page on my patreon
00:35:31 become a patron
00:35:33 totally understandable but
00:35:35 that does nothing for me as a non-patron
00:35:37 I think you're possibly
00:35:39 somewhat handicapping your reach
00:35:41 by giving some preview
00:35:43 to people in some way
00:35:45 I don't know exactly what would be the best way to do it
00:35:47 the way you do it, that's what
00:35:49 it's like, you post a page on patreon
00:35:51 then maybe like a week later you post it publicly
00:35:53 so like, if you're a patron
00:35:55 you still get that bonus of it being like
00:35:57 oh, I got this on the inside, like I'm up to date with the bin saint lore
00:35:59 I know what's going on
00:36:01 that's reasonable, I suppose
00:36:03 you got your eternal stingy fucks like me
00:36:05 who just will never pony up the dollar
00:36:07 that's why you make it public
00:36:09 so that you can still have benefit
00:36:11 no one can market to you then
00:36:13 well, you'll never get my money
00:36:15 but you will get my
00:36:17 support and my spreading of the content
00:36:19 so that's something that you can leverage
00:36:21 you can get, I'm not a patron to Ben
00:36:23 but I did buy
00:36:25 the vapor's kickstarter book
00:36:27 that's the sort of thing
00:36:29 I'll put money down for
00:36:31 rather than a recurring payment
00:36:33 buy a cool thing
00:36:35 so if people know about
00:36:37 and like your comic and more people are fans
00:36:39 that's just better
00:36:41 the biggest currency
00:36:43 someone in your position has to trade in Ben
00:36:45 is awareness
00:36:47 yeah, attention, exactly
00:36:49 so putting that first
00:36:51 my rationale
00:36:53 maybe it's good, maybe it's bad
00:36:55 but I like
00:36:57 and I want the
00:36:59 well, like
00:37:01 you know
00:37:03 when I work for a long time
00:37:05 and I release a full comic
00:37:07 like Vapors 3, done
00:37:09 one of these days I'm gonna say
00:37:11 guys, this Friday
00:37:13 Vapors 3, it's coming out this Friday
00:37:15 and then on Friday, bam, Vapors 3, it's out
00:37:17 it's sort of an event
00:37:19 and I've looked at my
00:37:21 website analytics or whatever
00:37:23 and on those days
00:37:25 I get a big spike
00:37:27 and sometimes
00:37:29 my viewership stays
00:37:31 a little elevated after that spike
00:37:33 and I don't know
00:37:35 I'm sure there's an argument to me
00:37:37 that maybe if I spread that out
00:37:39 there'd be a lot of smaller spikes
00:37:41 and maybe viewership would grow
00:37:43 over the long term, I don't know
00:37:45 good or bad in terms of that business model
00:37:47 I know I would do something similarly
00:37:49 because I feel so
00:37:51 I want my videos
00:37:53 and my artistic creations or whatever
00:37:55 to be released in the way that I want them
00:37:57 to appreciate in that way
00:37:59 so with patrons, that's one thing
00:38:01 but I sympathize
00:38:03 when I first started doing the whole
00:38:05 comics thing, I thought
00:38:07 I don't really like reading
00:38:09 one page at a time
00:38:11 you've championed that
00:38:13 I like reading something in one big chunk
00:38:15 the whole story is one story
00:38:17 I want to consume the whole thing in one
00:38:19 blast because that's really how it's meant to be consumed
00:38:21 not one page every week
00:38:23 here's a thought
00:38:25 and I was just going to say on top of that
00:38:27 also, releasing
00:38:29 an early two patrons
00:38:31 is something that I do for my patrons
00:38:37 I would think it's good to offer
00:38:39 something
00:38:41 and then that's one of the things
00:38:43 just to confirm
00:38:45 none of Vapor Chapter 3
00:38:47 is on your website, none of it, correct?
00:38:49 that's right and there is
00:38:51 not an unsubstantial amount
00:38:53 of pages that you've released to patrons
00:38:55 so imagine you're a Ben St. fan
00:38:57 who likes your comics, likes the Vapers
00:38:59 but maybe you aren't as initiated
00:39:01 as
00:39:03 maybe some other St. Heads
00:39:05 or maybe you just don't want to patron someone
00:39:07 from their perspective, Ben St.
00:39:09 has not released a comic page
00:39:11 since the champion
00:39:13 since the champion ended
00:39:15 well, I mean
00:39:17 there was nuts the beginning
00:39:19 if you want to count that
00:39:21 okay, sure
00:39:23 then yeah, you're right
00:39:25 so I think
00:39:27 again, there's a middle ground here
00:39:29 I think it would be
00:39:31 I don't know if there is a middle ground on this
00:39:33 I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing
00:39:35 that it just comes randomly
00:39:37 at some point because like
00:39:39 with animators on YouTube
00:39:41 that used to be like they would do nothing
00:39:43 and then suddenly there was a new video
00:39:45 and you're like, oh cool
00:39:47 it wasn't like a detriment
00:39:49 some people would get mad
00:39:51 that somebody didn't upload
00:39:53 like Egoraptor didn't upload enough animations
00:39:55 and they left
00:39:57 and I never understood that mindset
00:39:59 but I guess some people are like that
00:40:01 where if they don't get a constant feed of information
00:40:03 they're just going to be upset
00:40:05 I mean I don't think people will be too upset
00:40:07 at someone like with Ben's release model
00:40:09 because I think they're relatively used to
00:40:11 like the long delays between stuff
00:40:13 so it's a different-ish sort of thing
00:40:15 but I mean on the subject of
00:40:17 something of a compromise
00:40:19 here's a thought
00:40:21 I think it is something of a problem
00:40:23 even George R.R. Martin
00:40:25 has released like sample chapters
00:40:27 of Winds of Winter and I think that's
00:40:29 helps him
00:40:31 here's a thought
00:40:33 maybe either like releasing a page as a tease
00:40:35 to give some general maybe something like that would work
00:40:37 or perhaps
00:40:39 when you tweet
00:40:41 when I see those tweets that are like hey
00:40:43 new page is available to my patrons
00:40:45 and I have the idea of having like a
00:40:47 just like a screen cap not of the whole thing
00:40:49 but of like one little highlight
00:40:51 of the page to be like a tease almost
00:40:53 to be like hey you could see this
00:40:55 and so much more
00:40:57 if you're on board with this shit
00:40:59 that I think would do a lot for me because I have not seen
00:41:01 new Ben comic
00:41:03 for I don't know what a year or something
00:41:05 now and I would love to
00:41:07 I'm very excited to see more
00:41:09 so something like that might both drum up
00:41:11 I mean it could persuade me I mean potentially
00:41:13 think about it like this
00:41:15 or just to pay more attention
00:41:17 I would wager to say
00:41:19 that blank
00:41:21 that blank Patreon link is not very appealing
00:41:23 indeed
00:41:25 I would wager to say that a lot of people
00:41:27 do not think of you
00:41:29 as primarily a comics
00:41:31 artist in a lot of ways
00:41:33 that's true and it's partially my fault
00:41:35 because your other work is
00:41:37 so much more visible
00:41:39 and so
00:41:41 much more frequent
00:41:43 Ben St. is far more
00:41:45 of a streamer or a
00:41:47 video essayist than he is
00:41:49 comics and I don't even think that's
00:41:51 because it's wildly that you produce
00:41:53 these things more though you do obviously
00:41:55 but just that they're so much
00:41:57 easier to get to people
00:41:59 than your comics because they're just
00:42:01 behind the Patreon wall
00:42:03 and not as many people
00:42:05 see it as
00:42:07 probably want to see it
00:42:09 I mean some of this is inevitable
00:42:11 I mean a lot of people would want to see it more
00:42:13 than just our Patreon too
00:42:15 I mean it's a platform
00:42:17 problem right
00:42:19 my Twitch streams
00:42:21 are on Twitch
00:42:23 and you know people are on Twitch
00:42:25 I got like a thousand and some change
00:42:27 followers on Twitch there they get notifications
00:42:29 my Youtube videos
00:42:31 are on Youtube
00:42:33 that's where people are
00:42:35 it's definitely part of that
00:42:37 are on my website which does not have a subscribe feature I think it's definitely
00:42:42 something to be said that if you release more on there there will be more
00:42:44 traction I haven't I haven't released I've been releasing my old pages on
00:42:48 line webtoon I'm trying to get online webtoon and when I start releasing
00:42:53 Vapors 3 I'm gonna be releasing them on Topastic again which I do I always
00:42:57 forget I have like I have like six thousand five or six thousand followers
00:43:01 on Topastic that I just forget about yeah it's not bad I don't even think about
00:43:05 their existence ever I was thinking about like in terms of like websites and
00:43:12 retention and people going to your website I was I was thinking about like I
00:43:18 want forums back I want I want to bring a forum I want to make a forum on APS
00:43:23 adventures dot site where I like I do like most of my notifications and
00:43:29 stuff and maybe even I mean like I have a community on Discord but they are
00:43:34 mostly just chat about nothing like if I had them to like if there was a
00:43:39 reason for people to go to my site just for no reason just to hang out then it
00:43:45 would be better for me in every way when I made my website peep like like like
00:43:53 webs like how-to sites on the internet as well as like individual people that I
00:43:58 talked to about it like I heard a lot like you got to have a comment section
00:44:02 like you got to put a comment section under your pages so you can see so people
00:44:08 can discuss and shit and I thought about that and you know I have I wouldn't say
00:44:15 I have a huge readership even right now and you know back then it was much
00:44:18 smaller and I just I just thought about well two things one I thought about all
00:44:24 the all the shit that we say about like the comment section under a YouTube
00:44:28 video being a part of the experience it's a part it becomes a part of the art
00:44:33 if you put it there right and apart and it's a part that I don't have control
00:44:37 over and no I don't want that I want your site is very clean and well I I totally
00:44:42 value you know the utility of comments I it is it would you know it would mess
00:44:46 with the aesthetic of the site which I would mess with the aesthetic of the
00:44:48 site of the site of the site it would affect the message of what I'm trying
00:44:53 to put there would affect the experience I'm trying to give the reader or
00:44:56 whatever and I don't like that furthermore I just thought back to all of the
00:44:59 like modestly known web comics that I've ever seen and unless you're huge you go
00:45:06 to a website for a comic and you look at down at the comments and it's like zero
00:45:11 comments on bait if you like if you got one if you got one on every page even if
00:45:15 you're a popular web comment you'll have just zero comments and it's just a bad
00:45:19 look and embarrassing Frank yeah I even though it happens to like everyone it
00:45:24 looks bad and I don't want to look bad yeah it makes you it makes you feel it
00:45:28 makes you look like nobody is reading and therefore it's like going into a shop
00:45:33 where there's nothing on the shelves yeah even if people are reading it's like
00:45:36 well why would you post a comment on like every page like maybe you'll have a
00:45:40 bunch of comments on like the last page or the first well Ben clearly you don't
00:45:43 get over to my and visit my friends on I don't know what it like dojin moe no
00:45:47 that's not it like an ex hentai.com where you'll see just some some some real
00:45:52 troopers commenting on every page oh yes I would also like to do this to my
00:45:56 sexual partner ah yes that that also was the good sex right there.
00:46:01 If I had one.
00:46:03 Oh us gamers am I right?
00:46:06 I completely empathize with like wanting to have things be a big block you just drop
00:46:11 and it has a huge impact but I just don't think that that's valuable.
00:46:16 I mean Munchie might just be right that like no matter how you want to do it I
00:46:20 mean I get that like there's no reason for me to make like big videos that take
00:46:23 a long time it's just a mistake but I'm going to keep doing it anyway because I
00:46:26 want to so I mean on YouTube the algorithm specifically rewards frequent
00:46:32 content I think well I think the algorithm rewards that because that is it
00:46:36 kind of ties into human nature like people get hype for for regular we
00:46:41 Aguas yeah that's true and when you know I mean you leave a little trailer for
00:46:46 the last one that you did the Kingdom Hearts one I think like that was yeah
00:46:52 like that build-up hype people are waiting for it but it's it's only like
00:46:57 they were expecting it because you used to post it weekly and that that's in the
00:47:02 name and it's kind of a joke that it hasn't been weekly but playing the hype
00:47:07 is a dangerous thing to do because it risks the the the the possibility of the
00:47:14 bubble bursting that's true you can build a pipe for a while and if you pay it off
00:47:19 well the rewards are sweet but you run the risk of very easily waiting too long
00:47:26 and then no one cares that's why that's one of the many reasons why you don't
00:47:30 talk about what you're doing until it's like done yeah like you don't you don't
00:47:35 promise a thing until it's like beyond a shadow of a doubt that it is going to be
00:47:40 delivered yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah cuz if you know I should say yeah if you
00:47:45 if you hype yeah hype you know it's that thing about like investigator like
00:47:50 any day now guys I'm sure just like I'm pretty sure I oh well no that's not yeah
00:47:57 okay you know when you when you I mean there's the thing it's like when you
00:48:01 talk about what you're working on you get that emotional release as though you
00:48:04 had shown it to someone as though it were done which kills your motivation to do
00:48:08 it and also the fact that yeah if you don't end up doing it so so it makes you
00:48:12 less likely to finish it and then if you don't finish it it is emotionally it is
00:48:17 damaging to the people that were hyped and are now disappointed and it's like
00:48:20 emotionally damaging to you I don't know about you guys I mean I'm sure you
00:48:25 get this as well but like I love I to a to a what's the word I supposed to a
00:48:30 problematic degree probably I love keeping my projects completely under wraps
00:48:35 or as much as possible and then just complete like t-bap resurrection for
00:48:39 example look took a look like we sure we were not working on it the entire time
00:48:43 you know steadily but like little bit of time really talk about it we I mean I
00:48:48 avoided discussing any details basically tension and I'd like to be cryptic and
00:48:52 not give any like exact dates as to like when we expect I've done that before
00:48:56 it's a mistake I still do it occasionally I like that too I think that
00:49:00 vapors 3 is going to be I think people really will really like it and I have
00:49:06 been saying that I'm doing it for a while but I haven't I mean I might have
00:49:09 spoken a little bit about it on a stream here or there to like that's a pretty
00:49:13 small chunk of the people that will end up reading it when it comes out so I'm
00:49:17 yeah I get it it's cool it's cool to be cryptic and I think when people read it
00:49:22 they'll be surprised and I think there's value in that and yeah so I just look at
00:49:27 how great t-bap resurrection turned out with all the all the I mean the dope-ass
00:49:31 intro that we were so hard to make and then like the ending with our multiple
00:49:36 Mr. X like new characters showing up for the ending with a risky business and
00:49:40 then our live-action segment at the end it was just a real layer cake of
00:49:44 deliciousness and to have spoiled any of like that the image of Ben and me
00:49:49 looking at the camera your two fathers caught you masturbating you know that
00:49:53 look yeah it's a great it's a great image I see people using it it showed up in
00:49:58 the dating sim it sure did it instantly became a little bit iconic it
00:50:04 absolutely did and like I wanted to tweet like like when I was first editing
00:50:08 like six seven eight months ago I wanted to just do something with that image but
00:50:13 I mean it was not hard for me to say no no no I must wait I must wait there will
00:50:16 be a time when this you know pays off I'm I'm glad the conversation has gone in
00:50:21 this sort of artistic direction because the thing I wanted to talk about today
00:50:25 was some data on on Andrew Hussie and the comics he's written compared to mine I
00:50:31 went and looked at the the dates that his comics were published well pages were
00:50:38 published and of Homestuck of all of it all of the things I got the numbers
00:50:42 how to break it down so jailbreak is first little one 134 pages drawn across
00:50:49 two days so that was that 134 pages and no not not hippo Hussie yeah I know but
00:50:57 wait he drew 134 pages well yeah I mean jailbreak is very simple this very much
00:51:03 stick figures that's pretty impressive that's still that's still a lot yeah it
00:51:07 is yeah it's pretty good problem sleuth 1,700 pages a lot of them in very
00:51:14 impressive gifts drawn in one year exactly mm-hmm 1,700 that's like three
00:51:22 yeah three days the two yeah something like that and yeah a lot of them are
00:51:27 huge yeah projects in and of themselves okay that's when he really got into his
00:51:32 style of like the what we see later of Homestuck where he has his character
00:51:35 assets and will like move them around and it becomes easier to produce fast I
00:51:38 mean I just that's good he did that that's yeah yeah cool and then all right
00:51:43 I've made a little graph for Homestuck because we all know the Homestuck
00:51:47 declined in speed at least indeed the first year was 1,668 pages the second
00:51:55 year 2,048 the third year 1,005 1,014 1417 I can't read numbers for the fourth
00:52:06 year and then it was like yeah 5,600 with year 5 yeah act 6 happened at the big
00:52:13 like somewhere in year 3 so like the first two are you fucking kidding me
00:52:18 that's when act 6 started oh yeah yeah disaster so like x6 was you know this
00:52:25 took a long time like what's the word epic exponential growth meme are you
00:52:29 guys laughing yet are you laughing for these last five years yeah I mean it was
00:52:35 very impressive especially since you know act 5 he adds so much color and it's
00:52:40 the feature all of the things get so good but that's the year he does most of
00:52:44 his work like the speed is at the highest like cascade is in year 3 so yeah
00:52:51 imagine we just gotten like two extra not bail james but problem sleuths
00:52:58 instead of all of act 6 what a great lifetime that would be pretty sick that
00:53:02 would be the brightest time line and then and then I went over to my to my
00:53:06 images because I hadn't been like well I'll just say that the numbers first
00:53:10 a canon story my first thing 141 pages so very similar to jailbreak and that
00:53:17 took like two hours to draw that in a stream and maybe one day to like write
00:53:23 all the texts so that's pretty good jail bail jpe which is the big one that I've
00:53:30 been working on is only like 367 pages one of which is a video game so that's
00:53:36 pretty cool indeed but it was started according to when the first image was
00:53:41 created around the 8th of February 2018 so it's been more than a year almost a
00:53:47 year it's been yeah that's barely that's barely a page a day you hack I know it's
00:53:51 well I mean for first part of that it was me trying to juggle that and
00:53:56 hypocrite videos and then also I have other things going on but I really I
00:54:03 was looking at all these numbers I'm like bail jpe is so small it's such a
00:54:07 tiny little thing I really gotta do bigger faster work but I don't feel too
00:54:14 bad because unlike a hussey in in bail jpe I I got tired of like copy pasting
00:54:21 the it's strange to say but like copy pasting like images and on layers was
00:54:27 more of a hassle than just drawing a new layer for each panel so I just drew
00:54:31 them all in uniquely individually and then I'm finishing it off with kind of
00:54:37 an overblown animation it's not like beyond my capabilities but it will take
00:54:41 a few few weeks sure sure but yeah art I was so fast he was too fucking fast yeah
00:54:50 I faster his own good I think a lot of this is not being focused like you said
00:54:57 you for a lot of that you were you know you had hypocritical and even now
00:55:03 there's something to be said that when you are in the sort of work that we are
00:55:08 and you had the sort of disparate projects that we do it's very easy for
00:55:14 you to be paralyzed by indecision and for you to have a lot of little things
00:55:19 that just sort of feel like they're bigger deals than they are for instance
00:55:25 if you're been you might have been for a while maybe you didn't have necessarily
00:55:30 anything on your plate they had to do that day but you always had ten paces
00:55:34 and draw over your head thinking oh maybe I should do that today or maybe I
00:55:38 should do papers three today there's so many things you were keybabs and whatnot
00:55:41 or tea or tea bath yeah stuff like that just a ton of things that you could do
00:55:46 and that makes it so it's hard to do any one of them because you're just thinking
00:55:50 what am I gonna do well maybe I will watch this YouTube video maybe that's
00:55:55 what I'm gonna maybe I'll just play enter the gungeon for 12 hours yeah maybe
00:56:00 we'll just do that it's easy for you if you haven't clearly defined what work
00:56:05 you're going to do what kind of stuff you're gonna accomplish each day it's
00:56:09 very very easy to just sort of fall into a routine of doing a whole lot of
00:56:16 nothing but still feeling overwhelmed I felt this a lot even recently yeah where
00:56:21 there wasn't a lot of like stuff that I was even doing but it was so easy to
00:56:27 feel overwhelmed like there was so much on my plate just because there was so
00:56:29 much stuff being unfinished because they're all just at the same time stuff
00:56:33 I know I have to do and just I felt that way for a long long time and and now
00:56:39 that my you know now that teabab and and ten paces are done I'm really not
00:56:44 eager to start anything new I really am so relieved I've kind of I kind of quit
00:56:49 the poo videos I don't know if I'll go back and finish yeah I don't know if I'll
00:56:53 go back and finish season one I had like maybe two more episodes of that that I
00:56:56 might make but I kind of don't want to think about it right now I just I'm
00:57:00 really happy that like the first three is the only thing that I have on my plate
00:57:03 and but speaking I'm totally with you but actually this circles back to hey
00:57:07 remember how it was discussion at the beginning of the episode I said I put a
00:57:10 pin in something that I wanted to say but I had not said it but I did in fact
00:57:14 write it down and I just want to talk about very briefly just in you know as
00:57:18 Ben was saying just now that yes when you're trying to come up with a project
00:57:22 and like when you're trying to schedule and plan what comes next that's the
00:57:25 hardest thing to do but I feel such a euphoric freedom when I simply have
00:57:30 intelligently or not committed to the project I'm doing and said I don't care
00:57:35 a meteor could fall outside my house could be burning around me I don't care
00:57:40 I have my project I am free I just need to work on this one thing nothing else
00:57:46 matters right now it is kind of my favorite feeling in the world and as soon
00:57:50 as the project's released that feeling lasts a few minutes and that's like
00:57:54 shit think about my next fucking video now damn it feels good it feels good for
00:57:59 a moment and that's like oh but it's that's why I'm that's why I like it
00:58:05 feels so good to be out of the YouTube rat race the the the no more chasing the
00:58:09 algorithm the fact that you have to be consistent to I mean production algorithm
00:58:14 right of like I mean I just mean as soon as like any projects done it's time to
00:58:18 move on to the next project just in life right I suppose I mean I'm kind of
00:58:22 excited about bail jpeg being done so that I can move on to the next thing
00:58:25 rather than you know well I mean it's not like doing the animation is boring or
00:58:33 I hate it I like it it's just also the idea I mean I was reading like looking
00:58:39 at the the time in between problem sleuth and Homestuck it was just like a
00:58:43 couple days just like you finished you finished the the problem sleuth and he
00:58:48 did some epilogue pages and introduced the midnight crew in one of them and
00:58:52 then he was just like yeah I'll just start Homestuck I had this idea for a
00:58:55 while and they started it and it you know it just kept going like every day
00:59:00 there'll be like five six images and you know the first year it got all the way
00:59:05 up to Jack ascend like imagine that right I'd non-stop not a single day was
00:59:11 messed I checked every day there was at least an image a page that's like hey
00:59:16 yeah that's I want to do that I would I would yeah I would love to be I would
00:59:21 love to be like that hey I'm just curious does anyone know was was Hussie
00:59:24 like able to successfully like live off his work specifically during not bail
00:59:29 jpeg but but during problem sleuth is he like full time at that point he had an
00:59:33 audience yeah but I I mean but was it monetized like I like live he had ads
00:59:40 yeah I assume he was making his money through ads and I mean this was I mean I
00:59:44 think ads were worth more back then I mean he had enough clout by the end of
00:59:49 problem sleuth to start making books didn't he's my real question I don't
00:59:52 think I don't think he made books until Homestuck was well oh well maybe this
00:59:56 this may or may not be the case what I'm really asking is like was he having to
01:00:00 like do a day job in addition to doing this I think you must not have he must
01:00:05 not have had a day job if he could have uploaded every no I feel like not I you
01:00:11 know maybe you're remembering wrong but I remember something about him like living
01:00:16 like kind of low budget like all he needs is a computer and his tablet and
01:00:22 he can just do anything he's just like me he's just like me indeed yeah here's my
01:00:29 message just to the people on that subject though I mean Hussie had to work
01:00:32 his way up I haven't followed his career extensively in his early days but I mean
01:00:37 for me it's very much if you want to be an artist guy I mean we all feel this all
01:00:41 the time just that we wish we had more time wish you had more hours in the day
01:00:44 to do stuff I mean I have basically you know whatever I've been doing YouTube
01:00:48 like part-time essentially for the last four or five years whatever and it's just
01:00:54 I feel such a desire to just be able to throw all my you know force into it I
01:00:59 feel like I can just explode and do all these great things once I've made the
01:01:04 time and I'm just like but that's on me I gotta figure out a way to get there
01:01:08 that you know will let me continue to live and frankly you know I'm not like
01:01:12 Ben I don't want like I need a decent amount of money to have a decent ish
01:01:17 life not that whatever I'm not even joking about bed like I'm just I'm
01:01:20 simply saying my I want a little more that's fair although more money would
01:01:25 help of course patreon.com spent I feel I sometimes I worry that maybe this meme
01:01:33 that I am a that there's not even untrue meme that I am that I am like a low rent
01:01:38 like like you know what do you call it scowl ag something like yeah it makes
01:01:45 makes makes people feel like oh well he doesn't he doesn't need any money so I
01:01:49 don't support not true I do need money of course not a ridiculous amount but
01:01:54 more than I currently have would be really nice okay that's fair yeah okay
01:01:59 patron.com is not a joke ladies and gentlemen this is not this isn't your
01:02:05 dad is in fact deadly serious this is life and death yeah yeah I find extremely
01:02:11 useful and I have just just a few days ago when I was organizing my my schedule
01:02:17 as I mentioned previously I think it's very helpful to literally write things
01:02:21 down to very absolutely just completely black and white what am I doing what
01:02:28 projects am I currently producing right now and I do that with my whiteboard I
01:02:33 not to belabor the point not to belabor the point I also want to say that this
01:02:37 past month my pay is a couple of big patrons reduced pledges and my rent
01:02:42 went up for unrelated reasons fair enough save me help please okay well I'm
01:02:51 still paying shit room rent because I still have the shit room but one of the
01:02:54 guys who was living here left and we did not find a replacement so I've mentioned
01:03:02 it to him I don't know if he could afford what we would charge for a room but
01:03:08 he didn't put the he didn't close down the possibility but I mean he doesn't
01:03:14 need a room right now he don't think he'll need one for a little while so
01:03:18 that maybe we'll see yeah I don't know fair enough I don't know okay sorry to
01:03:21 interrupt oh god I think it's good to because most of the time when you feel
01:03:28 overwhelmed and you think oh god there's just so much I have to do in
01:03:31 actuality there's not and it's not that you're you're stupid it's just that it's
01:03:35 easy for the human brain to get overwhelmed by uncertainty so in order
01:03:39 to be certain just write down the projects that you are working on and when
01:03:44 you can remove some of the boats some of the stuff that you don't have to do and
01:03:47 just kind of focus on those things it becomes so much easier for you to focus
01:03:51 on oh actually there's nothing I can do if I just allocate time here and there
01:03:56 oh wow look at that I've accomplished my goals you just have to be certain on
01:04:00 what you're working on you just have to remove uncertainty you know you can move
01:04:04 in decisiveness this isn't exactly the same thing but as just so this isn't
01:04:08 about exactly managing tasks that lie before you but actually what I did the
01:04:12 other day was just out of the blue I decided to make a list of all my total
01:04:16 life goals and this was spurned on by I watched PewDiePie's video that was it
01:04:22 was like another googling himself and I'm surprised about how frankly he talks
01:04:27 about like how much money he has and I mean he was just like I mean it's not
01:04:31 secret or anything it's not really a secret I mean the the figures are like
01:04:34 wrong but he was like yeah I think my net worth you know like those like what I
01:04:37 probably like 20 million or something and I was like well shit there you go I
01:04:41 guess these are the facts yeah and I've actually learned a lot I actually from
01:04:46 PewDiePie I learned about CPM or whatever like cent per meal or whatever
01:04:51 it's like a European thing like per meal as in per thousand right yeah that's
01:04:55 right that's right yeah and actually just incidentally I don't know if this is
01:04:58 true for everybody but I make the most money from Australian views so for every
01:05:03 like thousand views from Australians who watch ads on YouTube you make the most
01:05:08 per capita or you make the most total well I mean per capita not not total
01:05:12 because like it's I've like 59% of my viewers are from the US and like Australia
01:05:17 is a I'm just saying if everyone moved to Australia that would increase my income
01:05:21 so I really appreciate that if you would do that for for bin technique PCP HQ
01:05:27 Australia Sydney I know we don't want to move to what we want other people to
01:05:32 move to Australia because like right we want them to be exchanging their
01:05:36 currency with us at a favorable rate and some and maybe we would get new
01:05:44 Australian fans you hear about you hear about the Prime Minister did today I
01:05:49 hate them anyway I just I made a list of all my total life goals that the one
01:05:58 that spurred it on was actually that PewDiePie just said one of his life goals
01:06:02 is to own a house in Japan and I was like me too motherfucker me too so so that
01:06:09 became generally one of mine and I've just I've got a total of 14 yeah I mean
01:06:14 what of my what are my goals here I'm honestly shocked that he can't do that
01:06:18 right now the reason he can't is not money it's due to like like immigration
01:06:22 and visa issues I think specifically I mean which I'm sure in time he could
01:06:26 probably I'm sure he doesn't have 20 million dollars available right now well
01:06:30 you know what he said the issue was actually this was interesting he said
01:06:33 and yes he'd probably need to liquidate like at something I don't know also I'm
01:06:35 surprised I'm kind of surprised it's only 20 million I would guess me to me too
01:06:39 a little more than that but whatever but what he said the the real issue was
01:06:43 was that when it comes to getting a visa like claiming your you like you have to
01:06:48 state like your job and your intentions when you travel internationally and
01:06:50 stuff yeah and so like when he puts down his his employment he's a youtuber and
01:06:55 he said that first of all like youtuber isn't a real career in like in the eyes
01:06:59 of Japan particularly and also the Logan Paul shenanigans have given
01:07:03 youtubers a really bad okay so actually affected immigration issues wow in his
01:07:11 eyes I mean maybe that's not a hundred percent accurate but that's you know
01:07:14 that's what I mean it doesn't that's not inconceivable that's not I mean I've
01:07:19 heard of Japan's serious immigration at one point I was thinking maybe I'll move
01:07:23 to the to the US yeah but it's the same sort of problem like I can't get in
01:07:28 because I'm a youtuber I don't mean no immigrants my dude we've had enough of
01:07:32 those although you know soon I can now say that I'm a writer instead cuz that's
01:07:37 true that's true income like I mean couldn't you could call yourself a
01:07:40 freelancer I mean as long as you report your income wouldn't that be Japan is
01:07:44 very strict I mean Japan regulates its population pretty strictly when it comes
01:07:48 to immigration and stuff so like maybe who knows like exactly what their
01:07:51 process entails they maybe they want like an interview and they want to know
01:07:53 like what who you are what you do and like significant detail I don't know I
01:07:57 don't know boy okay I understand that but surely
01:08:02 Japan must realize who PewDiePie is on some level not as in like the
01:08:07 immigration officer like watches PewDiePie but surely he's like he's the
01:08:11 most famous person on he's like famous famous well are you guys aware that not
01:08:16 only was PewDiePie passed by T-Series recently so he is no longer number one
01:08:21 I saw that he released a video a celebration music video today called
01:08:26 congratulations to T-Series where he snidely congratulates them in hopes that
01:08:30 they're decadent you know giant corporation that somehow managed to
01:08:35 defeat one Swedish boy that they're myriad corruption scandals and me too
01:08:40 if she's happening to not tragically wouldn't that just be so sad pretty
01:08:46 funny I got I got me too by T-Series
01:08:51 I got me too the other day what a fucking what a nightmare what a life
01:08:56 yeah indeed indeed but but you know just to back to the point making a list of
01:09:00 life goals was good and helpful it's I'm pretty good at making task lists I do
01:09:06 it not every single day but frequently when I have like 20 things to get done
01:09:10 in a day and they're not even big the only way I can do it is to make a list
01:09:14 and then I like if they're fast and easy I will burn through those motherfuckers
01:09:18 tell me tell me if this is relatable to anyone or am I a freak my if I think if
01:09:23 I wrote down my list of life goals every single thing on the list would be a
01:09:28 thing I want to make and nothing else mine or more about well I mean I don't
01:09:33 know like my number one rule my number one life goal is to like be morally
01:09:37 upright and I put when in doubt adhere to the golden rule so like that's the sort
01:09:42 of goal I'm keeping in mind just like a way to live in general okay but a lot of
01:09:47 a lot of my like big dream thoughts is to be someone who's like you know
01:09:53 obviously I like doing the art that I do but but in the back of my mind I'm
01:09:58 like ah if I was a good enough artist I could like be friends with Andrew Hussie
01:10:01 oh I could I could talk to them and be like cool and like I'll be I'll be one
01:10:06 of those those you know the mysterious elite artists who talk to each other I
01:10:11 assume yeah you know okay now that you say that that I also aspire to that to
01:10:19 be to not just be cool and glorious myself but to like but to travel in
01:10:25 circles you know what I almost tweeted the other day I whatever I was like
01:10:28 busy and didn't but I was this is my tree I was gonna tweet like for some
01:10:31 happiness is like I don't know like a walk on the beach whatever blah blah blah
01:10:35 but I say happiness is measured by the number of secret backroom executive
01:10:41 boardroom meetings you are in over the course of your life relative to the rest
01:10:44 of the population to me that's happiness that's you know that's true okay it
01:10:50 feels cool to have like a secret meeting that people will not know about
01:10:54 indeed indeed by the way but here's their here's your visual people the visual is
01:10:59 the the meeting in godfather number one when you know Vito Corleone meets with
01:11:05 all the heads the five families at the tail end of the film that is what I
01:11:09 aspire to in my life I want to be there oh yeah things things of that nature
01:11:15 like every time I have like a meeting in about like the movie I'm making and
01:11:21 there's like an important person there and like a producer is like oh you know
01:11:25 this is this is like something's happening right here things are being
01:11:28 things are being said you talked to somebody pretty big the other day I
01:11:31 forget who maybe you don't want to say was that a Mike Cooper he's a feature
01:11:39 director feature animation guy at Ardman he was as is that the wall he was a
01:11:45 Wallace and Gromit guy right am I not the Wallace and Gromit guy he was also
01:11:50 called Mike but you know one of the big guys old guy was given info feedback on
01:11:57 the script and we we talked about stuff he looked at your script and gave you
01:12:01 feedback on it that's pretty dope dude and and then we had dinner later and it was
01:12:06 like that was like a business trip I went on a business trip to Scotland that was
01:12:12 like the coolest thing that's dope dude that's so that's so romantic and sexy
01:12:17 hippo totally yeah you should you should shag a Scottish last like the
01:12:26 Pokemon Sword and Moon yeah cloud cloud and hopper what the fuck it's called

01:12:56 on a projectivity mindset today I'm glad we're sure about this I've been thinking
01:13:02 about constantly I just made this is just a small thing but like I've I really
01:13:07 have committed I'm a little bit late on my new we Agua but I have after after
01:13:11 what else is new I know after the power creep arc is indeed over it's true like
01:13:16 I've got a we Agua in the editing bay just needs a you know a day or two left of editing
01:13:20 and it will be out and I've also got the next one already not feeling like ready to go
01:13:25 knowing what I'm doing you gotta commit to we Agua I I'm effectively committing to we Agua
01:13:32 and I'm sure I'll reference that in some way so it is it is what is happening so uh
01:13:39 another logo coming up I say you know tightening my own chains around my own neck
01:13:48 it's a totally new show we Agua's dead long live we Agua totally new original idea I just came
01:13:54 up with I want to go back to when we were talking about Ben's comics I just want to say oh sure let's
01:13:59 do that uh that I was on st comics whenever we're talking about something like PCP I I just look at
01:14:06 it like pictures of whatever we're talking about on the internet I don't know why I do it
01:14:10 add to the show notes of course and and and I I clicked on the the vapors number one and I had
01:14:17 such like a visceral reaction like an emotional reaction to seeing the like first like title
01:14:24 screen title page cover page of the vapors by Ben saying and right it was almost like
01:14:30 this is so iconic I can't believe I'm talking to the person that made it in a weird way I don't
01:14:38 I don't want to turn this into a dick-sucking thing but like the vapors is like a real thing
01:14:46 that is so I don't even know what I describe it other than like like yeah like iconic it like
01:14:51 influential and like but it's not influencing anyone it just feels like legendary it feels it
01:14:58 feels mythical it feels like a legendary well I think what you're describing is that it feels
01:15:03 like a real big project with all the pop and circumstance that comes with that and yeah yeah
01:15:09 and it look at this page I have this page on my shelf right now like I have the physical version
01:15:15 of this comic thing I still want to copy I don't know the copy of the vapors well I can't believe
01:15:21 that it's it's real well fortunately when chapter three is done the Kickstarter for chapter two
01:15:28 will begin and in the Kickstarter for chapter two you will be able to buy bundles that include
01:15:34 the first book if you missed it the first time oh that does sound good uh yes I gotta start thinking
01:15:40 about that um I got I got I gotta start uh this is something you know I've been I've been chugging
01:15:45 along doing new pages and that feels good but in the back of my mind I've got that oh I need to do
01:15:50 some more shit I gotta I gotta think of I gotta write scripts for bonus uh vaporettes I want like
01:15:56 at least three probably more because chapter chapter two is shorter than chapter one and
01:16:01 I want to make up some of that length uh somehow wait is chapter three shorter than chapter two
01:16:06 or well it's not done I think it might be slightly longer than chapter two but not as long as chapter
01:16:13 one yeah okay I think uh we'll see something like that okay cool cool yeah right yeah yeah well I
01:16:23 think we're all in agreement that we all look forward to it very much uh yes um I feel like I
01:16:28 need to make my site more epic it feels pretty juvenile I my my site is so I'm you know I just
01:16:37 I made that thing with like such a basic understanding of like html and css it is
01:16:43 it's a I went back and revamped some of it it's it's functional and it looks decent
01:16:49 but the editing like like okay I know there are ways where I could have like automated the upload
01:16:55 process but one it is so inconvenient to update because like okay what what I need to do to it
01:17:05 is to make is to like enclose all the elements like the okay like the button bars for a long time
01:17:12 to change a button on the website I had to go through every page of the website and
01:17:17 manually update the button I change that for most things there are still a few things that are like
01:17:23 that I think and I could and I will fix those probably before I start uploading any more okay
01:17:29 I gotta up before chapter three comes out I'm gonna upload the um the um actually I should
01:17:35 do make these a patron exclusive I should make these like an early patron thing is the the the
01:17:39 vaporettes from the first book they gotta go on the website and I gotta and I gotta go through
01:17:44 the whole fucking thing and going through page by page and putting in the like when I put up a
01:17:49 new page I have to manually put in for example the numbers you gotta make some sort of database
01:17:53 indexing system or something that that's easier like put it like is each page has to link to the
01:17:58 previous page and the next page and the last page of the chapter and the first page of the
01:18:02 chapter and I gotta put those all in one by one and it's oh god it takes like it it's sometimes
01:18:08 it takes a day or two for the big update it'll take like an entire day or two just to put it on
01:18:13 the website um which you know could be improved some some to work on indeed yes indeed on the
01:18:20 subject of character specific interactions hippo I also want to ask you something about your comic
01:18:26 do you intend to always be the dude who makes homestuck like comics
01:18:39 no but I like I like it so I mean bell good place to start I suppose bell jpew is like
01:18:47 supposed to be that obviously with the name as well but I do have other types of comics
01:18:52 that I want to make so you're you're not intending to carve as much space underneath
01:18:58 Andrew hussey shadow as possible is what I'm trying to say no okay look at our boy toby fox
01:19:04 he's he's he's broken out and uh he's he's the role model here I'd say I don't want to underestimate
01:19:09 or underplay how much I love jailbabe and just even the way that it's produced I also want to
01:19:14 empathize the fact that I I too find the homestuck style very appealing and very much something I
01:19:21 would want to emulate for like like just the way that I work I feel it gels with me quite a bit
01:19:27 however I feel like there's something to be said that it just is no matter what it will almost
01:19:33 always feel and teeter on fan art jailbabe is not related to homestuck in any way but you can't
01:19:40 divorce from homestuck no matter what sure can't read it and not think about homestuck no matter
01:19:46 is it on is it on mspfa no okay I think somebody wanted to make a mirror of it
01:19:51 the I don't know what how I feel about that I am like I made a I made nuts the beginning
01:19:58 and I put that on mspfa not because it is particularly homestuck like but just because I
01:20:04 found that a convenient way to do the um the uh like timeline split yeah to have like multiple
01:20:11 endings I think there's like complete valid way in like the structure of homesuck I don't think
01:20:18 it's an inherently a wrong thing to do to have like you know you know not just like have it be a
01:20:25 text command parody but in the sense that you can have multiple pages and split paths and choose
01:20:30 your adventure like elements in there it's just I mean specifically with jailbabe I mean it's
01:20:35 literally on a website that's supposed to look like homesuck and it's called like APS adventures
01:20:39 or something to that effect it's literally called it's so similar I'm gonna you feel me probably a
01:20:45 good time to say that like I think when vapors three is done I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna go back
01:20:49 and finish beast capades which is um a much something that oh yes I'm very excited for that
01:20:55 yeah I was really excited about beast capades too the thing that excites me the most about beast
01:21:00 capades is that I don't think I don't think it was apparent like I don't think that the amount
01:21:05 of it that I did communicated where the story was going I don't think anyone probably could
01:21:10 guess where the story is going but the thing about beast capades is that it has an ending it has a
01:21:15 specific like ending in mind and I know mostly how it gets there and I am just really excited to
01:21:24 you know is this is this tell a story with a definitive ending and then you finish it and
01:21:29 you're like yes wow that story went places hey is this too much you know what I mean in terms of
01:21:34 like I'm curious I know these things always change but like if you had to guess what percentage of it
01:21:38 would you say like is complete now of beast that's a dangerous question to ask it is a dangerous
01:21:44 question to answer and I'm gonna preface it by saying I'm probably wrong okay like whatever I say
01:21:49 will probably be wrong but I think maybe 25% okay that's good that's good what you know locked and
01:21:57 loaded written down right now I mean it's definitely well it's definitely not halfway done yeah but a
01:22:03 big chunk of it is done so somewhere in that region so I'm just gonna ballpark it at 25% okay
01:22:10 I've been thinking about like the the whole like Homestuck Hussie's Shadow thing because like I kind
01:22:15 of do regret naming my website APS Adventures even though you know I don't really mean I mean hail
01:22:21 MS Paint Adventures is dead it's homestuck.com now so it is dead but the things that are called MSPA
01:22:27 still why did you say hail did I say hail yeah you said hail I think I meant I meant say like
01:22:33 hell I guess I just said I think you meant to say hell but you said hail I apologize to the audience
01:22:38 to the commander I was I was going to say I was going like hail okay sorry hail not yeah okay that
01:22:43 makes sense sorry I really like to be pedantic and point out when people pronounce things wrong
01:22:48 appreciate it appreciate point of order I'm like I'm like a game of order I'm so smart that I pointed
01:22:54 out that you said less instead of fewer relate to me audience point of order hypocrite I will be
01:23:01 hurt yeah I'm fucking I think I've lost the train of my thought what was I saying oh you're
01:23:06 regretting that you named it APS Adventures a little bit kind of oh yeah yeah I like um
01:23:12 I could you know quite easily just make a new site it would be a hassle and yeah I just call it
01:23:19 something else change the name of it I guess I could just change the name of it big floppy
01:23:24 dongs.com I'll be there I had a completely other point but I just I've lost it oh sorry we fucked up
01:23:39 guys yeah I mean I have the memory of a goldfish I have a cool thought but I can't write the yeah
01:23:45 whatever well let's talk about well let's talk about capitalism and it's many anyway back to the
01:23:52 vapors by me you know I do I do want to just quickly say I want to hurt all your feelings
01:23:57 real quick yeah and just this is we're getting a little hug boxy so I just want to retort with
01:24:03 all your efforts mean nothing if you can't survive off them I mean you can you can play in the sand
01:24:09 you can be a little sandbox baby who you know works like a normal job and then supports your
01:24:14 art on the back of that but until you go and you're you're a real boy a real survivalist
01:24:20 off of your art are you even a real boy are you even a real boy Gibb is because Gibb is a real
01:24:25 artistic job now but yeah for the rest of us we we've we've got some work all right I don't care
01:24:31 about that I've remembered what it was I agree with that okay atreon.com slash Ben saying to make me
01:24:36 a real boy the whole thing about staying in the house and yeah and stuff when I started it I copied
01:24:44 like the the arrow going forward and the text commands as if you were the characters just
01:24:49 because that's what he did and I thought it was funny but you know more recently I've been thinking
01:24:55 that is because he played games that were like that and I didn't do that I am doing that because
01:25:01 I'm ripping off Homestack not because I'm ripping off text-based adventures and it's the same thing
01:25:05 with like Hussie knows a lot of code and if I were to try and make coding jokes I wouldn't know what
01:25:11 I was doing yeah so like it would it would be like wrong so like going forward the things I'm
01:25:18 gonna base I mean I've already written a few stories that could be like novels rather than
01:25:22 comics anyway they're just like stories that work but the the way I'm going to approach them
01:25:30 regardless of what I whatever the site's called or like whether it's just one panel per page
01:25:34 because I just like that in general is that I'm going to base things off of things that I
01:25:42 grew up with and know about more so than you know good like um text commands specifically like the
01:25:49 idea of commanding the the person reading the adventure is uh uh commanding the character to
01:25:56 do stuff that's only because um the characters actually were being controlled by the viewers
01:26:03 with uh the prompts that the people were giving and I hadn't I hadn't done that and so it was really
01:26:09 just like very hollow very like um copying for no reason sort of thing so if if I ever copy anything
01:26:16 from Homestuck in the future it'll be because um not you know I will consider the usage or like the
01:26:23 reason Hussie did it in the first place right right including the fact that he made so many pages
01:26:29 and he had his characters uh you know reuse the assets because the reason he had that in the first
01:26:33 place was not because he can't draw like me it's because he wanted to have the fan interaction be
01:26:41 like a major part of the comic and the faster he can make the images in response to the prompts
01:26:47 the the more intense it would feel and that's why he wanted to to make it like that I feel like
01:26:53 Hussie you know if he makes a new thing he's not going to do the the command the prompts from the
01:26:59 viewers because he's done that to death and his art will be like completely different
01:27:04 from Homestuck which is probably why he's like apprehensive maybe to to do anything because
01:27:09 damn it you need to go go Toby Fox Hussie isn't he still well isn't he still working on um
01:27:15 Hype Swap he well I suppose he is yeah but that's almost sad to me I I feel like that's like
01:27:22 bolderline cancel Hype Swap yeah uh Hype Swap is in like I like it's so
01:27:29 long and so just I I I honestly see it being like a failed kickstart and I don't think it will be
01:27:35 finished it's it's so a dude whatever I think about the first chapter already came out and people
01:27:40 generally liked I mean I haven't played it and I feel honestly guilty about that but but why haven't
01:27:45 you played it Ben could it be because you just don't care anymore well I was kind of over it
01:27:51 and also or two not yeah like the fact that it's only the first chapter I'm like I'd rather
01:27:56 play the whole thing except the delta rune chapter one was hype as shit and was the
01:28:01 fucking dopest thing in the last several years I I can't help but when I think of Hussie I compare
01:28:07 him on every level to Toby Fox Hussie like did a huge kickstarter got complete he just fucked it up
01:28:13 financially stopped hurting Hussie's feelings I won't Toby Toby made like 50 grand made like the
01:28:19 biggest game of all fucking time as a first-time game developer fucking he went on but he's already
01:28:25 made his sequel thing and he's working on it sure it recycled some assets but it's fresh it's new
01:28:30 it's beautiful I love it I can't wait for more it makes me want to piss so badly yeah I have to
01:28:36 I don't know I don't know I know I'm getting a little bit over the top on Hussie I but it's just
01:28:42 that he hasn't the last thing I heard from Hussie was him making a game that I'm not interested in
01:28:48 and you know like kind of fucking up his legacy a little bit with like getting rid of msp a.com
01:28:54 and change it that's not a huge deal but then he just hasn't made anything new for me so I'm just
01:28:59 here like well I really liked Hussie but what do I got to I mean I imagine he's working in the
01:29:04 I mean he did that like kickstarted thing with drill like he and drill made you know that's true
01:29:09 that's maybe uh the the sweet bro and hello Jeff book which I wanted to buy I just I just didn't
01:29:13 I meant yeah same yeah same I got it I got you got it is a great spoon inside is it cool
01:29:20 um I like it but it the things that you you may have seen from uh like the previews of the art
01:29:27 yeah uh doesn't exactly look like the sweet bro and hello Jeff earliest comics it's more like the
01:29:32 later sweet bro and hello Jeff comics and we all love your comics yeah and and the whole thing is
01:29:37 pretty funny so I you know I feel and I got the fidget spinner you know I feel like it's worth it
01:29:42 did it come with a fidget spinner yeah I got the fidget spinner edition it's got like it's
01:29:47 got like the holographic film and and the angle at the angel of the book itself is like um
01:29:55 it's not at 90 degrees there's just sort of like on one of the corners it's like
01:29:59 an acute angle so it just sort of goes off in a weird direction it's hard to fit on the shelf
01:30:03 it's really funny I have I have a fidget spinner actually our our our mutual friend econ gave it
01:30:09 to me uh it's a sweet it's a sweet metal yin yang fidget spinner nice fucking sick and I just want
01:30:15 to let everyone know what a cool guy that was such a legendary piss I'm honestly mad that it
01:30:20 wasn't on the episode I'm honestly I didn't just take the bullet and do it on the it was I did it
01:30:24 for like it was insane it was insane was it just quantity was it the power behind it I mean both
01:30:31 it was it was a total package it was a total package was it one that was just like continuous
01:30:37 force the whole time yes ends abruptly yeah yeah doesn't just travel off trail off yeah yeah cool
01:30:45 all right should we go to voicemails do you think oh yeah no no no before we yeah before we go to
01:30:51 voicemails we should shout out the the pcp dating sim thing that came out yes okay okay thing about
01:30:58 that and I think this is just a me issue I am having trouble getting it to run I got it to run
01:31:03 every time I opened it it opens up this window it's a gray window that just says j s dot n w or
01:31:09 something like that yeah yeah and one time I got it to open and I played it for a while I did a
01:31:15 bunch of branches it was very amusing but then I I think I hit a bug or something or I got to a
01:31:21 something or the text wouldn't load some if the game it I got to a point where I seemed to not be
01:31:25 able to progress anymore so I closed it and then I couldn't open it again and that's and I'm very
01:31:30 upset that's too bad it was pretty cool and funny well let's okay let's start from the top here
01:31:35 people if you're not aware yesterday today's the 31st on the 30th at pcp dating sim that's them

01:32:29 got to avoid the landmine deaths as you go through uh and you can make it all the way to the end
01:32:33 but what I did not discover uh until I was playing it again with Michelle later and we were trying to
01:32:39 do even more options there's actually some choices you can make early in the game that affect what
01:32:44 your ending is way later independently I won't spoil anybody I have a guess I have a guess about
01:32:50 what one of those might be okay but at I mean I only discovered we only discovered one when we
01:32:54 were playing but like at the end we we you discover uh let's just say an arch nemesis of all pcp dome
01:33:00 and uh uh that that encounter can be changed uh depending on uh uh you know what uh what's done
01:33:08 as you go through the game and uh it's super funny and hilarious and don't want to fucking beat it

01:33:42 even give a shit it's fucking hilarious every word of it is priceless and and it it's just it's
01:33:46 just such a legendary shitpost and the opening movie that these guys made at the very beginning
01:33:52 the anime intro is that like an incredible Gundam it's I think it's the original Gundam uh I think
01:33:58 or Gundam Z or I don't know I have no idea it seemed I couldn't make out the logo and I'm not a Gundam
01:34:03 boy uh anyway it was hilarious and dope play it every pcp member shows up um good good good and
01:34:10 it's there it's great yeah some of them are hard to find though so you gotta you gotta put in the
01:34:14 work to find them and uh the ending is truly hilarious um when you discover the greatest
01:34:21 podcast of all time but I'll leave that up to the viewers to discover so I don't spoil it for them
01:34:27 oh boy that's oh man this is there's more mysteries here than I realized yeah yeah I I gotta figure it
01:34:33 out I gotta figure out how to play this fucking game uh the rest of the way one time I don't know
01:34:38 what the fuck I don't know what I did the one time that made it work I yeah I don't know dude
01:34:43 I mean maybe just download it again would be fine maybe maybe have you given uh Munchie have you
01:34:49 guys played through have you done it yet no I I don't know I've seen screenshots though I know about
01:34:54 it yep I've played through I haven't got like multiple endings uh you die a lot uh there's a lot
01:35:00 of wrong decisions to make yes you do save often people save often uh I definitely encountered
01:35:06 some bugs hey here's a shout out to one bug to those guys it's probably too late to do anything
01:35:10 but when you talk to mage on the staircase uh as you leave Digi's classroom I think uh that's the
01:35:16 one that's that's why I had to restart the game that I just yeah the text just didn't load it just
01:35:20 doesn't load so uh yeah so I guess that's just a dead end probably probably okay well whatever
01:35:25 anyway the rest of it people go play it's legitimately hilarious and fun uh highly recommended
01:35:31 highly recommended yeah um and shout fucking the next p at pcp dating dropping tomorrow for us in
01:35:38 the past for you let's see maybe it'll be a joke it's April 1st what could that imply I don't know
01:35:44 we'll see I I don't know I talked I talked to it's supposed to be real I talked I talked to
01:35:50 Levent Hart who assures me with all possible sincerity yeah that it is not a joke that's what
01:35:55 they say and and that the April 1st release date is not meant as a troll and I mean we'll see about
01:36:02 that that's not really in doubt like if it I feel like I'll believe I'll believe it when I see it
01:36:09 I mean I feel like it would be very like stupid to to have a fake game on the April 1st I mean
01:36:16 yeah something will happen something will happen I think I said last time but I don't know what
01:36:20 something will definitely happen I think but I said last time that like we've talked about previously
01:36:24 in like April Fools I know at a million years ago on a piece of yeah I said we said like
01:36:28 the best April Fools jokes are when it's actually something like expansive and like actually fun
01:36:33 that no one expected and it is surprising and funny and perhaps foolhardy but it just like
01:36:38 is a real project that you can play and enjoy that's a real project not necessarily what you
01:36:45 expect yeah I mean if it would just turn out to be I don't know I mean fighting game honestly
01:36:49 if I were betting if I were putting my bets out I mean I think they're just going to release
01:36:53 an actual demo of the actual dating I agree I think that's the most likely that I think yeah
01:36:57 and by the way we have maybe a little bit insider information I mean some people on
01:37:01 I don't actually know who was on the team doing any of this I know only like one or two people
01:37:07 but like in the at the end of the pcp dating sim the the meme one that just came out those guys
01:37:13 go on to like it actually it's actually really sweet spoiler is this a spoiler no it's not really
01:37:17 a spoiler it's just that at the end they say like like they're like we're excited too for the bigger
01:37:23 pcp dating sim so like it's like an advertisement almost to hype up the big release of like the
01:37:28 demo or something and it's that that was so sweet that they that they put that in there
01:37:32 and uh I those guys might have insider knowledge I don't know I don't know don't know we'll find
01:37:37 out tomorrow and you people will know yeah all right I'm very I'm very excited I'm very you'll
01:37:42 definitely be able to find we'll retweet anything on the pcp at TP Krasnayers Twitter so go check
01:37:48 that if you're you know if you're looking for updates um okay we don't have to spend a lot of
01:37:57 time on this but I feel the need to respond to all the people calling me a fascist in the comments
01:38:04 last week uh okay for what purpose for what reason uh for because I was supposedly anti-free market
01:38:13 and more and anti mostly was an anti-free speech people people okay this would piss me off people
01:38:18 in the comments respond they weren't even generally making an argument like Ben what you are saying
01:38:25 is anti-free speech sure they were just sort of taking it as an assumption it's just like
01:38:29 so so Ben's anti-free speech and here's why I'm against that and and like like it's just the
01:38:34 base assumption and I just want to say that I fucking hate all of you because okay what we were
01:38:40 talking about everyone just fucking jumped in logic they made a huge fucking logical leap
01:38:45 we were talking about tom getting kicked off mastodon yeah we were talking about platforms
01:38:49 mastodon is a privately owned platform that people are in charge of and have the ability to curate
01:38:56 I'm I'm not talking about like making it illegal to be to to say the n-word or whatever but I'm just
01:39:04 like okay did you made all those rants he made all these videos he's talked so much in the past
01:39:09 about how you know it's his plat his youtube channel is his platform and it is within he
01:39:15 does not have to let you into his house and and give you a platform to say whatever shit if he
01:39:21 doesn't like it you know and that's true for all of us like if it's your platform you are not obligated
01:39:26 to let some what to let people say whatever they want to say even stuff that you disagree with
01:39:31 stuff you don't want propagated you're not obligated to give people a platform you know
01:39:36 with the tom example so I hear what you're saying and that's not a crazy point or anything
01:39:39 well let me let me let me just finish so the like the logical and I absolutely agree with that logic
01:39:46 and it's the the logical extension of that is that if someone makes a platform it's their platform
01:39:51 mastodon or twitter or whatever and you might not like it you might not agree with their decision
01:39:55 but they are not obligated to let people say stuff and if they believe that something is you know
01:40:02 a bad ideology to spread I do I think they are not obligated to let you spread it I think they
01:40:08 have every right to be like I don't like what this person is saying I don't like that they're
01:40:12 saying it on my platform get out go say it somewhere else I mean if I'm not mistaken with
01:40:18 that's not a legal thing that's not me talking about criminalizing or censoring like on a legal
01:40:23 bait that would be totally different well I totally fucking different I hear what you're
01:40:26 saying man uh so with the tom thing I think that with mastodon like with tom he was kicked out of
01:40:31 a group made by users and I you know I think those guys probably like it'd be hard pressed to say
01:40:38 are you not allowed to kick a friend out of your friend group or something I mean that's a little
01:40:42 you know that's not exactly their group so that's not even being kicked off the platform as I mean
01:40:47 maybe I missed something but I think that's it although okay maybe I misunderstood yeah I mean
01:40:51 the point still stands but whatever the thing about I'm fucking mad I hear you but the thing about
01:40:55 getting kicked off Twitter is like I mean so yeah so so Twitter's definitely a private platform and
01:41:01 the the thing people bring up about this is that like okay um it's fine that you know we've got
01:41:07 private businesses they can do what they want and all that they they don't have to platform users
01:41:10 they don't want to or whatever um but I suppose you have to think about like what the goal is so
01:41:15 like Twitter claims to be just for example a platform where like they want everyone to come
01:41:21 together and speak but and yet at the same time they go beyond that and they enforce policies
01:41:26 that favor some ideological groups you know over others and they say like okay but some
01:41:31 speech simply isn't allowed here so really what they're saying is that they actually aren't truly
01:41:37 going to welcome every type of speech here they actually have an ideological lean and like again
01:41:43 if you're talking about like a small group like this is like 10 people and they have their little
01:41:46 you know let's just say communist club or whatever and like you got a free market and
01:41:50 arco cap he's like I like this they're like get out you're not one of us like obviously that's
01:41:54 fine but when it becomes an issue I guess with the like the idea that this is the new open marketplace
01:42:02 and the Twitter claims to be a place for everyone to come and speak well here well here's a problem
01:42:07 and I think this is a problem that arises because capitalism sure and that is the fact that this
01:42:12 platform that is you know supposed to be a free marketplace of ideas or whatever is privately owned
01:42:19 they own it they made it they own it they get to say I don't think this type of speech is good and
01:42:26 I don't want it on my platform yeah I that's a fair point and it seems like the only real
01:42:32 ways around this are like I mean at a certain point you gotta ask like what's best for the
01:42:37 civilization and like this is what a government's for to keep things like getting crazy and out of
01:42:41 control so you know I'm not actually but let me go on let me go one step further and make
01:42:47 the argument that I think people last week thought I was making which I wasn't okay let me just go
01:42:52 right ahead and make it you're not allowed to run into a theater and yell fire we all heard this
01:42:57 example because that is a that's a harmful action that is false and deliberately harmful speech it
01:43:04 causes harm through you know it's it's engineered falsehood to create damage yeah that's true what
01:43:11 about someone going on the internet and spreading like bullshit statistics about like about like
01:43:18 white genocide and the great replacement or whatever and inciting like we need oh we need a
01:43:23 we need a piece we need a peaceful relocation of the jews I think that would probably help with this
01:43:28 issue look okay first of all then is that not is that not false harmful speech okay well you've
01:43:34 got to make a distinction I think it's disingenuous to say that those two claims are exactly equivalent
01:43:40 and I mean you'd probably agree with that I mean they're not the same act but I think they both they
01:43:45 have the same the same descriptors could apply to one versus the other that would qualify them as
01:43:51 you know not protect look legit like if you've got just I mean you know to try to you know
01:43:56 delocalize it from the hot button issues if you've got like let's just say I think this is a
01:44:00 politically incorrect word but whatever you know what I mean like the eskimo population
01:44:03 let's just say that they though like there's a there's an identity I think you're I think
01:44:07 Inuit oh yeah okay let's say you've got whatever I frankly I don't give a shit but whatever I
01:44:11 got you got you got the Inuit population and like among those people they've decided um like we
01:44:17 don't like let's say there was some Scottish people whatever they move they're like we are gonna we
01:44:21 believe that our society should be us and we do not like the Scottish influence that's coming in
01:44:26 and so we are going to enact a peaceful like you know like not again like because there's
01:44:32 there's various discussions about like what white identitarians or white nationalist want
01:44:35 or they want like buyout policies or like relocate like whatever it's just that like you
01:44:40 that the policy and the ideas by themselves like people are going to have these ideas in their
01:44:46 head and banning them from somewhere doesn't get rid of the idea so I think at a certain point you
01:44:51 need to think about is it actually a good thing to do to ban these people from the platforms is are
01:44:57 we doing any good to deradicalize and is is like them being present doing direct harm in the same
01:45:04 way that yelling fire in a crowded theater is and are you actually doing more harm than good I
01:45:08 I this is it's a tough thing and I think you have to balance all the elements in a conversation like
01:45:13 that and I again I'm no expert I'm a dunce about this shit I'm no policy genius there was a you
01:45:19 know there was a time there was a time when being on the internet yeah and being edgy and making jokes
01:45:25 about gassing the Jews was you know it was funny because of how audacious it was and it's like well
01:45:31 no one's actually going to do it so it's funny to say it yeah how ridiculous and then now here we
01:45:36 are in the year of our lord 2019 and you got you got open fucking rallies you got open white
01:45:43 nationalist rallies you got literal you got literal neo-nazis collecting in public and espousing an
01:45:50 ideology of genocide and I don't know that doesn't feel like it should be protected speech you know
01:45:58 I don't I don't think that's cool I think we are at a slightly different place I think you get to that
01:46:02 point and suddenly you gotta you gotta be like okay but are you allowed to advocate should you be
01:46:08 allowed to advocate for anything really so just to be clear you are in fact coming out to advocate
01:46:13 that some speech needs to be repressed and you're you seem to be making that claim I think I think
01:46:19 when your speech is we should we should do something about these Jews I yeah I don't know if I don't
01:46:28 know if I think that should be protected speech why is it better to force these people to not speak
01:46:33 publicly why is that a better solution they will that will not change their beliefs it will not
01:46:39 change their beliefs but are you saying because it won't spread the ideas yeah that like like
01:46:47 giving these people a platform spreads their ideologies and like they're advocating to like
01:46:54 hurt people but like that out there saying we should fucking hurt these people are you are you
01:46:58 allowed and listen your pretend what um conspiracy to commit murder is not protected speech why is
01:47:04 advocacy for genocide it's basically the same well okay roundabout way I think that you are
01:47:09 conflating a couple of things like I don't think that genocide look if you like if you're a serious
01:47:14 white nationalist for example and you want a buyout policy to buy out all minorities so
01:47:19 they will leave your country that is not genocide that is a white nationalism that is a different
01:47:24 thing who's talking about a buyout I've heard a Richard Spencer make that case for one okay well
01:47:30 I don't know well that's I mean I don't think that's what most of these people are talking about but
01:47:34 I mean I think that there's a lot of conflation going on and I think that the danger is when people
01:47:39 I and I think that you're a little guilty of this you're you're look yes there's absolutely
01:47:43 violence and you know identity and bad stuff that I am totally opposed but when you just I
01:47:48 feel like there's a grouping together of a lot of ideas here and saying that it all needs to go away
01:47:53 and it's all dangerous to even be allowed on the airwaves I just think that that enacting policies
01:47:58 to suppress that will do more harm than good and maybe I'm wrong and maybe I'm wrong about that
01:48:03 but that is my well you know what maybe maybe there's something to what you're saying can we
01:48:11 okay let's just okay what would you agree with me if what was being advocated for was just open
01:48:18 genocide you know okay that gets way closer to where I'm more likely to agree the only thing is
01:48:26 that like I don't know if it's really a great idea to govern based on specifically like beliefs as
01:48:35 opposed to action and so that I guess I kind of would like to I don't really know for sure
01:48:41 what I believe on that I can't say for sure I think it's a good idea to always ban it
01:48:47 because I I don't know it seems like that will definitely that still would lead to the same
01:48:51 problem that I'm talking about but maybe it's kind of worth it in that position I understand where
01:48:55 you're coming from yeah I understand the idea that like you know you know free marketplace of ideas
01:49:01 these people should be allowed to say what they're saying so purely pragmatically forget the
01:49:05 marketplace so that we can hear it and be like well that's bad but that's sure that's not that's not
01:49:11 always what's happening that's not always what happens I mean you're right but like that's the
01:49:17 thing these are these are like percentage cases right so it's about I think you end up in a game
01:49:21 of like if which choice does the least damage and like does the most good you have to like really
01:49:26 figure out the majority if if the overton window shifts like like if if these ideas get out there
01:49:32 and they get more popular and the overton window shifts more and more to the right and the majority
01:49:37 opinion the centrist opinion ends up being yeah we should get rid of these guys will we then be
01:49:44 saying boy I sure am glad I'm sure I'm glad that we let the marketplace of ideas decide what was
01:49:49 right for us because here we are we've accepted that that X group X ethnic group is bad and we
01:49:55 fucking got rid of them you know but I we fucking ended them I hear your point great I would make
01:50:00 two points one thought is that I think I'm glad we were so egalitarian about this uh okay I hear
01:50:06 your point and again that does make sense as well it's not unreasonable it's that that on the one
01:50:10 point I would make the case that I think that we are a long way away from something like that
01:50:16 but I understand people think that it's going to increment more and more so I get that yeah I mean
01:50:21 I don't think this is around the corner right yet but it's fair to say that like it's more
01:50:25 tax happened it's too close for comfort okay I mean I think that's you know whatever people
01:50:30 might feel differently about that but fair enough the other thing is I think that a large difference
01:50:35 between sort of more leftist and rightist thinking is about the emphasis being on
01:50:40 targeting a specific goal and then kind of advocating any policy to get there I think that's
01:50:46 kind of more like leftist thinking whereas I think more right thinking is about
01:50:50 implementing a system and again I don't mean to like load this more with moral stuff but like
01:50:57 implementing a principled system with the belief that like it will not you know lead to a bad
01:51:03 outcome and if you see that trying to correct the system when those such things occur and I
01:51:08 definitely sort of lean more towards that model of well let's let's let's let's implement let's
01:51:14 let's not let's just implement a system that will you know engender the jews getting the
01:51:21 fuck out of here you know we won't actually do it but I really think that's a pretty fringe
01:51:25 belief I and I get it it is a fringe it is a fringe belief but it's growing and it's there
01:51:33 it's there in the alt right but we'll it's undeniable it is undeniable will it ever go away
01:51:39 though is my question like will our struggles seem like it was away it seemed like it was gone it
01:51:44 was a joke and it's becoming less and less of a joke due to what I'm scared well look like I got
01:51:50 you Ben I I don't know I think we've we've covered decent ground I think that you and I are kind of
01:51:55 I don't know at the one point I don't love talking politics like this but the thing I think when Ben
01:52:01 and I discuss it hopefully the viewers agree we give each other charity in our arguments and
01:52:07 hopefully people see that and think that it's good uh and see that there's there's decent
01:52:13 points to be made on either side and like maybe I'm wrong but I like to think I'm approaching
01:52:17 good faith um and uh I feel the same about you so I mean I think you're a reasonable guy and I
01:52:23 don't you know yeah I I want to I want to like I want to actually engage yeah with your ideas on
01:52:31 this yeah I don't I don't want to just I don't want to throw anything out uh out of offhand
01:52:37 or whatever you know okay I think I think I've made my point about the people calling me a fascist
01:52:42 in the in the comments yeah isn't isn't May a fucking wanker I can't wait for her to resign
01:52:49 they're talking about Digi's fiance yeah which is gonna resign from that position of fiance wait who
01:52:54 are you talking about Theresa May Theresa May our department minister that fucking speech she made

01:54:25 from his exile it's I don't know I you know I was has he has he been found like Jimmy Hawthorne
01:54:30 I was handled I was handed this this mp3 file physically just the file itself not on any device
01:54:36 of any kind uh and I've smuggled it here across the border to try to find out did it look like did
01:54:42 it look like in Fullmetal Alchemist when Scar like pulls all the the words off of that page of that
01:54:47 book and holds it in like an orb like an orb of letters like floating around his hand did it look
01:54:52 like yeah I was it was a little bit more digital kind of like you're grabbing like a glowy effect
01:54:57 kind of thing but that's what it was but okay let's let's hear what pizza party podcast has to say
01:55:03 go congratulations you have dived into all the layers of the deep web you have uh crawled
01:55:10 out the dungeons and have found the witch made prize the secret anion of the pizza party podcast
01:55:15 you're now listening to pizza party podcast I'm your host it's a body podcast uh we have your
01:55:23 guests uh coming to San Diego uh Waldo from Wraith Waldo
01:55:29 we found uh a zombie lighting the bin line okay that would be hidden in the original
01:55:38 shear cartoons we have uh what um I don't think something's wrong returning guests um
01:55:47 the the brown is it I don't think this is it this is a this is a forgery god damn I did not

01:56:03 to be the pizza party podcast but you can't you can't you can't fake the original and it's and you
01:56:09 can't find it either I think I think that may have been a pcp fan and not actually a podcast
01:56:14 damn it's they're trying to stand there I don't think there are any of those actually it's it's
01:56:18 it's kind of funny how the pcp fans are either like you can't understand them or they're like
01:56:23 american children yeah that's true yeah yeah yeah yeah I like that too uh well that was disappointing
01:56:29 maybe one day we'll we'll get a real contact going uh okay moving on uh actual voicemails okay
01:56:36 here's a lovely call um you know what I'm not even gonna read this name uh it's all in the subject
01:56:41 matter and you're about to hear it let's get to it go a munchie wears killing code huh oh that's it
01:56:49 hey that's the whole okay actually that was a good voice that that that was a good voice I actually
01:56:54 thought that was munchie for a second I was I thought about this the other day about how I have no
01:57:00 desire to finish that series because first of all Tom's like like dead uh something like that Tom
01:57:07 like he's doing better everybody he's doing better he's still he's still on it I am games
01:57:12 uh that's true but also why would I continue killing code when I'm coding every day for endless war
01:57:18 the reason why I was doing killing is to motivate myself to do code but why would I need a show for
01:57:24 that when I already do it just in my daily life sure I understand that for you to live vicariously
01:57:31 through me and not actually do your work and to be just be like I like to see progress made I like
01:57:36 my favorite TV characters to have arcs and I want this to be spoon for me I want to feel like I'm
01:57:41 accomplishing something by watching killing code and not actually doing what I understand this might
01:57:46 be disappointing for you but from my perspective I've accomplished everything that I want to and
01:57:50 I'm living my ideal life right now and I code all the time and it's just well munchie I I want to
01:57:56 say I don't know whether to blame you or the fans for this but like um uh the people people in the
01:58:03 comments being like hashtag where's the podcast killing code and stuff and people like people
01:58:08 commenting on tbapp and 10 pays like where is killing code is that is that accurate there are
01:58:14 some there is some of it and I hate it and I hate them and I hate you why have you done much you
01:58:19 you need to make killing code finale already it needs to yes you need to make the killing you need to
01:58:23 kill you need to like do like the the we have killed the code we have killed the code the video
01:58:29 release you need to do the till that I'm not opposed to continue but I just see no no reason
01:58:35 for my perspective well hey as long as people no no no don't don't continue it if you don't want to
01:58:39 but please just just slip a dagger into its ribs put it out of its misery that's that's fair that's
01:58:44 fair I mean obviously the reason people say that is because the very first episode it's like we're
01:58:48 going to do this every week and if we don't you must attack us verbally and mentally yeah that's
01:58:53 true yeah I think that's the same height backlash you were talking about I mean I'm getting roasted
01:59:02 quite a bit for we ag was being late you know totally fair totally fair but it's because I
01:59:06 sent myself embrace we ag a boy okay okay indeed I just want to say yeah the difference between this
01:59:14 and reagawa is even though they're both supposed to be weekly or whatever you know we agawa was you
01:59:20 know like like it's it's good content for your channel you must survive yeah to make videos and
01:59:25 stuff like that killing code had a purpose and the purpose was not to be a show it was not to be
01:59:33 like well much I can't I can't let you off the hook on this surely you would admit it is not the
01:59:38 viewers who are at fault for believing your promise of a weekly show that that's not at all what I'm
01:59:44 saying that's not what all I'm saying I'm not saying that they were wrong to suspect this or
01:59:48 even wrong to want it or continue to want it after I mean you're explaining why you're not
01:59:53 going to do it which is fine which I totally get but exactly yeah that's that's all I'm trying to
01:59:57 say is that there's no like I'm I'm doing everything I wanted to do this was a man killing code was a
02:00:04 massive success in my opinion fair enough all right so so canonically killing code kill is it
02:00:10 killed it's yeah I haven't talked to Tom Tom might want to still do it yeah maybe Tom's Tom's
02:00:15 like hey I'm waiting and then he's too busy he's too busy creating 3d modeling that's doing a
02:00:24 different show he's making a game though you know what this will be interesting I wonder I wonder
02:00:28 what's Tom's done with with with all this this Cody knowledge these so I wonder he should let us know
02:00:33 we should let us know well that well that killing code finale that's where you get into that start
02:00:38 up killing code season two what did we do with killing code season one no no I think the finale
02:00:43 would just be like Tom and munchie in a call and say so what do you do I'll do endless war what do

02:04:48 some crazy dude all right some pink otter uh is calling it let's let's see what they have to say
02:04:55 dear denizens of the pcp podcast and any potential celebrity guests I've been listening to the
02:05:01 podcast long enough for my brain to rot and to believe that following my passions might actually
02:05:06 be a good idea so a little over half a year ago I began writing in my spare time oh good what I have
02:05:12 now is the first draft of a method I would simultaneously like to edit and release over
02:05:17 some unspecified amount of time however I was left with a conundrum where in the world do I post
02:05:23 this piece of garbage after talking to my stupid friends they suggested Wattpan but I don't particularly
02:05:30 like the idea of being on the same website as Naruto has a sister Sasuke love story
02:05:37 as stupid yet more experienced internet creators yeah I was intrigued about your opinions on the
02:05:43 matter should Wattpan indeed be avoided like the plague or am I just a fucking fan fiction figure
02:05:50 okay first of all what's Wattpan what is he saying I I don't know what what what what pad is a
02:05:55 it's a wait what what's the name of it what is it Wattpad like WATT yeah yeah is it a is it a fan
02:06:02 fiction site or is it just a fiction site that a lot of fan artists post on it's it's it's a fiction
02:06:07 site that oh it's most fan I mean none of us have ever done like long-form prose Tom kind of did
02:06:13 with a certain iteration of sorceress loss I feel like you might know more about I mean did you
02:06:18 wrote like uh his light novel I don't know what he released that on though I think he just made
02:06:23 a google doc yeah oh yeah like the thing with the thing with writing I mean I don't know either
02:06:28 because I don't I usually write for things that I end up drawing right um but uh I suppose
02:06:38 being on a platform doesn't necessarily mean that you are associated with the people on that
02:06:43 platform but people people will like think certain things if they know the you know like if Wattpad
02:06:50 seems like a place that everyone goes when they hear it then maybe not put it there well it's
02:06:55 it's also like if you're on a platform then people who are also on that platform will see you so
02:07:01 yeah fans might consist of I mean I mean there's nothing there's nothing stopping you from posting
02:07:06 on multiple platforms I was gonna say that's the solution even if it's just a personal thing for
02:07:10 you to make you feel better then you'd be like it's available on all these platforms like oh are
02:07:14 you on that Naruto one no no you don't understand I'm on everything I'm just I'm playing the game
02:07:18 baby I'm going everywhere I'm multi-plat and and I mean people will turn their nose up at any given
02:07:22 platform right like no platform is perfect or completely respectable uh I mean I would suggest
02:07:28 maybe maybe make your own website or maybe even just like a wordpress or something I mean he's just
02:07:33 trying to get a seat right right so and then just you know make your make your twitter profile
02:07:36 whatever put the description like author of you know whatever the title of your thing is make that
02:07:41 part of your thing you know talk to other talk to other amateur writers and stuff and you know build
02:07:46 a little personal brand around it I guess and while you work while you work on your next one um
02:07:53 I mean I yeah post that that's the answer posted to every every platform yep every don't feel boxed
02:07:59 and even like even if that put it on lulu put it on amazon have it like do like print on demand
02:08:03 sir you can do this you can have it like you can have like print on demand books yeah is it is
02:08:08 it self-publishing is it vanity publishing maybe but it's not completely illegitimate so fucking do
02:08:13 it whatever publications going to be like that anyway so you know and I mean you won't it's your
02:08:17 first book you know it won't first of all it might suck he's gonna keep working on it he said two
02:08:22 it's like he sounds like it's still being okay yeah okay but um let me just say it might suck
02:08:27 that's fine whether it sucks or not it won't sell that's fine this is your this is your base
02:08:33 this is your like this is the thing that I made and like this is what you you're about and you
02:08:38 work on your next one and and it's just you know don't worry about don't worry about the money don't
02:08:44 worry about making sales worry about building a this sounds kind of dirty when I like I see it as
02:08:49 but it's your fear for early shit is like you building your brand yeah right yeah absolutely I
02:08:53 totally agree I mean who out right out of the gate like is super successful very rarely are people
02:08:59 successful immediately like a I don't know like an undertale was his first time making a game
02:09:02 really but he was a modder so I guess even that wasn't his first like you know well I mean yeah
02:09:07 I'd feel like a lot of the success of undertale is down to Toby's uh proficiency with making really
02:09:13 catchy good songs for sure for sure so and he had a lot of practice in that already I didn't I mean
02:09:19 he also had he also had connections like Hussey promoted yeah he had he had lots of lots of help
02:09:23 with that um yeah yeah so I mean so the short answer to your question yeah fucking release it on there
02:09:28 and like don't well what are you gonna let like let the fact there's lots of fanfiction on the site
02:09:33 stop you from spreading your shit and hustling and getting that green my dude I don't think so get
02:09:38 out there post it there and then just be and then yeah like if that makes you feel bad post it everywhere
02:09:43 put it in a google doc that you can just link to people if they just want to read it you know
02:09:47 free of whatever else if you care about that but I say who gives a shit man that's um that's what I
02:09:52 think maybe maybe commission someone to draw you like a like a cover yeah spend the 20 bucks to
02:09:57 get funny effectively function as a cover art or something yeah hell yeah hell yeah and don't
02:10:03 don't do if you can't draw don't do it yourself there's nothing worse than like an embarrassingly
02:10:07 bad uh like piece of art piece of promotional art drawn by someone who obviously you know I always
02:10:12 thought I you know I enjoyed mumke's uh the triflers and all that but I always thought he
02:10:16 should have gotten a cover made I just know I never finished it I got like halfway through it
02:10:20 and then I forgot to finish I mean we had our podcast big fan loved it a lot really enjoyed it
02:10:24 maybe super pissed but I mean that's because it's supposed to so there you go right all right well
02:10:29 there you go there's your answer moving on he would he would know ask him he's I mean that
02:10:34 that sounds like a higher level though that was like actual releasing it for sale which I don't
02:10:38 think this dude's going for yet but I mean you can always ask him he might have well I'm saying
02:10:42 yeah I mean you can buy the triflers on like it's on Lulu and stuff yeah yeah Amazon books may I
02:10:48 don't know but like there's nothing stopping you amateur author from doing oh I mean that's
02:10:53 totally true yeah like why limit yourself if you don't have to you might as well just make
02:10:57 it available you might as well you might as well yeah so go for it dude yeah okay anyway okay next
02:11:03 yeah that there's your answer moving on okay this call is from a little guy you know him you love

02:12:11 he's a good man uh please call back give us more um all right oh okay we've got a very special so so
02:12:19 um so I just gotta say I am I am I'm just wait I'm just waiting for riddle my ass oh it's it's
02:12:24 coming it's coming you know it's coming uh but before that we've got uh so we've actually got
02:12:29 some robots calling in um so first we've got the pcp generator 0.0 0.3 gang gang 2020 yeah that's
02:12:37 fair we have to fight against them I got my got my yang shirt fuck the robot but we gotta know our
02:12:41 enemy so let's hear what this version uh of the alpha generator has to say okay uh go welcome to
02:12:48 the pcp version 153.6 edition four beta got the right lesson this program was carefully crafted by
02:12:56 the best scientists the world had to offer for your listening pleasure Ben sainte is here
02:13:02 so his best guy ever also made jopen brackets who does not talk close brackets laugh she left
02:13:09 what about yang gang best guy ever ah yes the yang gang is quite delightful I agree
02:13:16 Ben but I also hate that the laborers of the world are oppressed by the capitalist overlords
02:13:22 best guy ever best guy ever but they take money for work which was agreed upon beforehand
02:13:29 you are stupid come on guys I will get mad so I will talk about pokemon and all its derivatives
02:13:34 in length it's okay we're talking about pokemon I will join the conversation now because I know
02:13:40 something about pokemon which is not the case for politics which is why I have abstained from
02:13:44 contributing during that time mage insert nothing of value here thank you for listening to our
02:13:52 professional podcast and please donate your hard-earned money on patreon which contributes to
02:13:57 the abstract idea of making more of this podcast which we will do anyway and a possible gathering
02:14:02 at a later date yeah fair all good there it is okay you know is that it pretty good yep though
02:14:08 that was it so that was good I appreciate that okay so the good news is okay so first of all
02:14:13 I'm actually getting a little worried we've got another bot calling in uh and it's already evolving
02:14:18 because uh I mean maybe maybe yang was on to something because we podcasters are being
02:14:23 deposed by these robots that are just better in every way did you hear that last call that was
02:14:29 better than anything we've ever recorded on this podcast over 50% of the american population is
02:14:33 currently working in the podcast sector and every single one of those jobs is automatable god damn
02:14:38 he's right by by 2020 there will be no podcast we cannot compete with that level of quality therefore
02:14:44 we need to ban the technology it's the only fair thing to do okay but I believe in knowing
02:14:48 thy enemy so let's see what uh pcp ai bought version 208-03-30 uh oh wait no that's the date
02:14:56 it's version 208 okay okay here we go uh commence all right let's get into this urban
02:15:04 dictionary's definition for procedillary generated podcast is the procrastinators podcast
02:15:09 i don't think that's right good or can't be made by our machine i kind of agree
02:15:13 we're not at the level with that sort of thing what if there was a machine that let you turn
02:15:18 whatever you were thinking of dream about a god lost i mean everything's every day that's why
02:15:23 capitalism works that is keto it's not fair that people have money pay for leon dot com slash
02:15:29 then say we need to get everyone building themselves up that's how we get the star fleet people real
02:15:34 problem with procedurally regenerated art is that at some point it starts making a mess and
02:15:38 you have to clean it up is that really i don't like it it's not good i don't know why i am just
02:15:43 thinking okay press one one one one one one one one one one one one one that's okay that was those
02:15:51 two real algorithm they have evolved since that first robot it's already advanced this much maybe
02:15:56 maybe that interrupting each other maybe we should lean into this i mean we have now had yeah two
02:16:02 entire effectively two entire pcp episodes within this pcp that's true because we've had
02:16:08 two basically four it's like the the equivalent of like you know in uh in uh willy wonka they got
02:16:13 the pill that's like the full three course meal like that's what these are these are these are an
02:16:18 entire an entire pcp experience just the pure joy condensed into this few seconds this 45 second
02:16:24 podcast uh that's really all you need i really like that the topic was a podcast made by ai and
02:16:30 they actually discussed that as the thing they evolved so much dude i'm they're getting smarter
02:16:37 uh i'm okay so you know so uh the thing about yang i don't just agree with is that like if i can
02:16:43 be on top if we can be controlling the robots to just do our jobs for us so we do zero work
02:16:49 we reap the benefit while the rest of society stagnates and is destroyed but we can suck the
02:16:54 the wealth and the resources from them while that's happening that sounds great that sounds like
02:16:59 what i want to i mean that's what i mean that's what automation should do that's that's what i
02:17:03 believe in yeah the robot shouldn't lead to people being miserable it should lead to oh the work
02:17:07 is done for us well we can just relax we can chill out we can do some cool although you know i mean
02:17:13 okay that's true and i don't want to get too much into this but like why are we doing this again
02:17:16 look just just okay this one question i just have one it's like no if no question if you were i want
02:17:21 to hear it if you were the roboticist and like you knew that like if you made this robot that
02:17:27 it's just an omni robot it can do everything it'll replace every job on the planet and you know
02:17:31 that like your but you will not earn all the money it's gonna be taken and you're like fuck it
02:17:36 i'm just not gonna make the robot you know why is everyone else gonna benefit disproportionately
02:17:41 to my work shut up you fuckers uh what's your what's your word to that scientist who feels that
02:17:46 his work isn't going to be fairly rewarded that he should just do it for the benefit of humanity
02:17:51 is that you know uh i mean why wouldn't he be people i mean people are gonna have to buy his
02:17:57 robots right uh i suppose i suppose maybe the robots will build themselves and then they'll
02:18:02 you know they're smart enough to do that well here's what i would say i would say that okay
02:18:07 maybe it's bad maybe it's a shame that he won't be compensated however by creating this robot he
02:18:12 will create a utopia in which he doesn't need money i suppose he doesn't need rewards because
02:18:19 everything will be solved um yeah yeah so i would still say okay i'm gonna make i'm gonna make
02:18:25 they'll say it'll a partially controversial statement that i think you'll totally disagree with
02:18:29 and lots of people will but it's just that like if you're let's say you're a rich man on the top
02:18:33 of the hierarchy and you have the ability to make like to give everyone infinite wealth like with
02:18:39 these robots or whatever and you choose not to because you like your privileged position at
02:18:44 the top of the hierarchy here at my stance is i think that's you're like well if everyone's if
02:18:49 everyone's equal if everyone's equally provided for then i won't be above exactly i think it is
02:18:55 your right to make that choice and i i think it is your right to make the choice but you are a
02:19:00 fucking monster that may be a fair case you are a fucking demon who should be swell all right
02:19:07 okay good news people were passed that it's time to check in with riddle my ass batman he's here
