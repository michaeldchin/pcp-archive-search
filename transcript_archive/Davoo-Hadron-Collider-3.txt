00:00:00 During RADCON 2, I think I overdosed on PCP. I really love these PC people. The most in
00:00:21 the world. They are the coolest people and the most interesting guys. But there's no
00:00:28 possible theoretical human who is so interesting that I want to hang out with seven of them for a
00:00:34 straight week. Constantly. It was hard actually. It was actually really surprising. Uh, because
00:00:44 there were so many fun things to do and so many fun times to be had, but then there were just so
00:00:48 many moments in the middle where suddenly it's like, uh, oh, I'm just sort of sitting here not
00:00:54 knowing what to do, being like, hmm, so I just kind of retreat back to my room and then just do
00:01:01 what I was doing normally, but this time way more distracted because I know there's people out there
00:01:05 and, you know, every five hours or so, or every 30 minutes, someone will be banging on my door
00:01:10 being like, hey, here's a fun thing you can do. And I'm like, you know what, I agree. And so I
00:01:14 could never get anything done. That, uh, that Digibro's Discuss Yuri on Ice video, for instance,
00:01:21 is a, I was working on that for like a week and a half, I think, because I spent like a whole week
00:01:28 just barely trudging through it over the course of days and days because I had nothing else to do
00:01:34 in between sitting around during Radcon, um, but I never was able to give it a good consecutive
00:01:41 session. So I just felt disorganized the whole time, you know? It was still good, totally worth it,
00:01:47 but it felt kind of burnt out. And I had like this moment of, gosh, am I slipping away from the
00:01:52 PCP? Am I like becoming a bad? Am I becoming shit? Am I like, does everyone, does everyone still value
00:02:00 me? Am I basically just being a parasite on this establishment? You know, I get, I feel like I've
00:02:09 been too worried about what, um, the other PCP people think of me, or rather I know this for a
00:02:16 fact. I think it's because my whole life, I've never given that much of a shit about what people
00:02:22 think about me. Like it's, it's, it's always been like, you know, if you're not related to me, then
00:02:30 the only thing that can make me like you, or like an absolute requirement for me, like caring about
00:02:34 you is you caring about me. And like, if you don't, if you don't like me and you don't approve of me,
00:02:41 then you don't matter to me. And I'm genuinely like that. And even people who I do like, I don't
00:02:47 value them so highly that like their opinion of me can make me seriously question, like instantly
00:02:53 question my own opinion of myself. But then, like all the PCP people are that, they're people who I
00:02:59 think are so good and interesting and good that things that they say can really affect me, like
00:03:06 inspire me and whatever. And if they say something like critical towards me, I'm like, oh no, no.
00:03:13 And like, you know, I take it too far and I'm trying to get over that hump stump. I don't know,
00:03:22 I think, I think, I think I'm fine now. I just don't, please don't give me advice on how to deal
00:03:28 with this problem I just stated. I have it under control. But I mean, it is true that like,
00:03:34 it does cause problems sometimes. Because yeah, I guess I just, I guess I just want to shock it
00:03:40 up to inexperience of giving a shit what people think about me. Like I'm so not used to it. I'm
00:03:46 so not accustomed. I'm so not accustomed to people saying things and me really caring immediately.
00:03:55 That it's like bothersome to me. You know, I'm trying to, I kind of have the gain up right now
00:04:02 to encourage me to talk more softly, but I'm just not good at talking softly. It makes me
00:04:06 awkward. So I'm going to turn the game down. Yeah. Yeah, don't don't don't get me wrong.
00:04:14 Well, did I turn, did I turn the game up? No. Yeah. Anyway, don't get me wrong. I had a great
00:04:21 rad con to it was a great experience and all, but it just, you know, it just had to kind of like
00:04:26 recover afterwards. And I was, I was kind of kind of in a depressive funk for a couple of days,
00:04:32 because I was feeling like I was pissing people off and stuff. And they're like,
00:04:36 but now I'm recovered. I, I was just like, you know what, no, this, this whole operation we're
00:04:42 doing is too good. It's the best thing ever. And I get to be a part of it. And it needs to happen.
00:04:48 It needs to work. I want it to work. And I want it to work well.
00:04:53 I value it extremely highly. I mean, the position I'm in now, which I know I talked about this in
00:04:59 the first episode of my show here, but the fact that doing Digi's videos doesn't take that much
00:05:04 time. And like, that's really the privilege of this job. Like it doesn't pay that much yet.
00:05:09 Like it pays like a normal amount of money. But the privilege is how little time it takes. And I
00:05:14 can spend all that time working on other things. And I have in fact continued to be consistently
00:05:20 working on programming. That's the main thing I've been doing still. I mean, I wasn't doing a lot of
00:05:25 it during Red Contour, but I am definitely getting back into it. And I just want to let you know
00:05:29 that like, yeah, every, every Patreon dollar that is coming through Digi and then going on to me,
00:05:37 I am using, I am really using all of my time. I am really maximizing my efficiency. Because
00:05:45 because it's a good way to live. I don't like being bored and I don't let myself be bored. Like,
00:05:51 again, I was in kind of a depressive funk for the last couple of days, rather the last like 36
00:05:56 hours. And I almost never liked that. In fact, I don't know if I've ever been exactly like that
00:06:02 until just now. And it was terrible. I was like, God, I can't get out of bed. This sucks not having
00:06:09 the motivation to get out of bed. So what I did was this is a hashtag life hack. If you can't get
00:06:15 out of bed, throw your phone somewhere else in the room so that you don't have it anymore. And the
00:06:21 only way to get it is to get up. That's how I, that's how I did it. Oh, God, I'm, I'm just like
00:06:33 springing back so hard from that funk. And I'm now I'm like so high again. Like, yeah, I know Digi
00:06:40 on his most recent episode, or at least in the first half of his most recent episode of his
00:06:44 decompression chamber is saying how like, you know, don't think that even though I'm having a
00:06:49 fun time making videos, I'm always having a fun time. I spend a lot of time being bored, he says.
00:06:54 And for me, that is just really not the case. I am, I'm wired all the time. That's why this show
00:07:01 was called it. That's why this show isn't named after letting go and like disperse. So it's named
00:07:07 after I specifically thought what's the opposite of decompression? What's the most intense compression?
00:07:14 What's the most intense collision that happens in the known universe that can be recreated by man?
00:07:23 And that was the idea of this show of the title anyway. But also the theory behind the show
00:07:30 is I don't really relax much. It's just fun being stuff all the time, you know.
00:07:37 Maybe, maybe I have some optimism chip programmed in me because I was raised to believe that there's
00:07:46 a God and everything will be great at the end. I don't know. For those who listen to all of the
00:07:51 apescape playthrough by peace by us on this channel, you'll probably know that I was saying
00:07:57 this before in that show, but to spin it in a much more positive way, I feel like on some
00:08:01 fundamental level, the way my perspective of the universe is wired is kind of, is kind of
00:08:07 programmed around the assumption that God is real and that like most of what the Bible says is
00:08:12 accurate and stuff. Even though I completely every second intellectually don't think that,
00:08:17 I feel like it still sort of affects, like it's still part, it's still intrinsic to my core
00:08:22 understanding of the universe. And so I guess that just kind of makes me optimistic. Maybe I'm
00:08:29 wrong though because that I should be at my core depressed because I'm not upholding Christian values
00:08:35 in my life. I mean, I mean, I'm kind of upholding most of the agreeable ones. I don't know. Yeah.
00:08:46 Oh, yeah. So I want to give you an update on my, my, I mean, on me becoming a hashtag code boy.
00:08:56 I finally figured out that C plus plus, I can kind of retire that one for now. Like it was,
00:09:00 it was useful learning programming through that. But I was thinking more about what specifically
00:09:06 my goals are, what my, what am I, what's my demand here. And really what I demand is,
00:09:13 is a, as a platform on which I can make a game or make a program 100% all manually by myself,
00:09:20 like where I'm in control of every detail, but where the details are not that obtuse and they
00:09:25 don't stack up to become that complicated. Because like all the ideas for games I have are nothing
00:09:31 mechanically revolutionary, right? I'm not like, well, specifically the main idea I'm thinking of,
00:09:37 I'm kind of running through it in my mind and I'm like, no, there's not going to be any
00:09:42 ridiculous programming challenge in this. Like it's all going to be basic stuff that already
00:09:47 exists in games, um, simple games, but reconfigured. So yeah, I'm confident that I don't need to become
00:09:56 incredibly amazing at detailed stuff. I just need to be organized and push on and stuff, you know,
00:10:02 you know, you know, you know. So a C plus plus, the problem is that just getting graphics on the
00:10:10 screen requires like downloading, like you have to build an engine for that, but like there's
00:10:15 ways to like have the engine built kind of for you sort of, but even that's kind of complicated.
00:10:20 You have to install SDL, which seems like a good program, but it's just every five minutes I run
00:10:24 into a thing where it's different for me than it was for the tutorial video that showed me how to
00:10:29 do it. So I was like, okay, I need to put this down. And like, so I was kind of, you know,
00:10:35 shifting around some, I looked at Game Maker again. And I was like, yeah, I can't do this,
00:10:41 because it's just, it's so, it's so much about menus, you know, menus that I didn't make. So I
00:10:47 don't feel like I'm completely in control. Like I know all the little twists and knobs, definitely
00:10:53 not into, um, drag and drop programming. And I mean, I know that you can make Game Maker without
00:11:02 using any drag and drop, you can do it entirely in GML, it's native programming language. But I'm
00:11:07 like, I just, I don't need this, I don't need these middle managers, you know, like every time I got
00:11:12 frustrated with C plus plus, I was like, you know what, fuck it, I'm going to go over to Godot. I'm
00:11:16 going to, I'm going to figure out that program. And before I even get like three minutes into a
00:11:21 tutorial, I'm like, I can't do this. I can't deal with like having my hand held by this other thing
00:11:28 that's trying to make it easier for me, because that just means I understand what I'm doing less.
00:11:34 So I finally got into Python. And I think that this is the, this is the, the sweet combination
00:11:41 of elements, the sweet spot that I've been looking for. Because I think it's, it's definitely centered
00:11:45 more towards people who are more simple minded, I think. I'm not, I'm not sure. Maybe I'm wrong.
00:11:50 I believe Google uses Python actually, so maybe not, but you know, it just seems like it's more
00:11:55 about being clear and like, like, sure, you have to do all the work manually. It is a programming
00:12:00 language, but it's more straightforward and like things are much more what they seem to, what they
00:12:06 look like at face value. There's no like sucker punches that you don't understand. I assume I
00:12:13 have barely just now scraped the surface of Python. So, you know, I'll see how that goes. But I, I
00:12:18 skipped ahead in some tutorials a bit, and it seems as though getting graphics on the screen is
00:12:22 more straightforward with it. I'm not sure though, but it, if nothing else, I can tell just by the
00:12:28 design of the graphics of all Python and Python accessories that they care more about aesthetics
00:12:35 and presentation and like smoothness and feeling good than C++ does. That's, that's kind of the
00:12:43 thing. Like C++, it always looks so dorky. It looks so like Windows 95, but hold the vapor wave,
00:12:52 where, and then like, meanwhile Java is like, well, you know, Java is universal and stuff,
00:12:57 but it's like, so I'm sure I could figure that out. But like the Java logo is so crappy looking
00:13:03 compared to other things. And like, and like the Java installer looks so ancient and cruddy. And I'm
00:13:09 like, for one thing, on the surface level, on phase value, it makes me feel less aesthetic. But
00:13:15 more importantly, if the Java people saw fit to make it this way, to let it look like this, then
00:13:22 they're not the kind of people who I think I can work with. They're not the kind of people who I
00:13:25 think designed something that I can understand. Because I think they just don't look and think
00:13:30 the same way I do. Um, yeah, doing all this coding, learning stuff has really made me
00:13:39 reconsider or made me consider more deeply for the first time. What is complexity? What is
00:13:46 complicatedness? Because I know those two words are actually different, complicated and complex.
00:13:52 Um, complex, I believe, means things that just has a lot of information. Complicated means the
00:13:58 information is confusing. It might be the other way around, but I'm pretty sure. Like, basically,
00:14:05 I think a lot of people have it backwards in terms of trying to simplify things,
00:14:08 or maybe I'm just weird, I don't know. But like, for example, imagine a list of a bunch of things,
00:14:15 a bunch of stuff on a list. And if it's a bunch of stuff, it's like, man, that's hard, that's
00:14:21 confusing, that's complicated, because there's so many things to remember. But meanwhile, I think
00:14:27 a comparatively small number of things that are like woven together in a very weird way
00:14:33 is more, is more difficult to learn. Like, the relationships between them
00:14:37 is harder to learn. Maybe it's an autism thing. Maybe I should get myself tested. I don't fucking
00:14:43 know. But the point is, I think people in general, I'm going to assume, are better at learning things
00:14:51 from a big drop-down list. Like, where every piece of information means the same kind of
00:14:56 things. Like, they have the same parameters, and they all relate to each other linearly.
00:15:03 Because that way you can like, it's like your brain can like, store a method for how to
00:15:09 take that information in, and you can apply that method each time to taking in each entry on the
00:15:15 list one by one. Meanwhile, if something is like, you know, only five or six things, but they're
00:15:21 all woven together with this complex web, you have to keep reformatting your brain in order to
00:15:26 take any information. And I think that reformatting your brain to make a new method is more difficult
00:15:33 than simply running an existing method. Now, obviously, both are different forms of learning
00:15:38 that are very enjoyable. You know, I'm just saying that one is harder than the other, which,
00:15:43 when successfully done, makes you feel even more satisfied. Like, it's sort of like the difference
00:15:48 between, you know, like watching a movie that like adds new elements to your friendly, familiar
00:15:53 format, and it's enjoyable and fresh and new for that reason versus a movie that, you know,
00:15:59 challenges what your definition of a movie even is, which is, you know, it can be even more exciting,
00:16:06 but maybe less enjoyable, who knows. So I feel like with object-oriented programming, I feel
00:16:12 like that's the mistake that people are making, or at least the mistake I made. You know, I don't
00:16:16 want to speak for anyone else because I haven't done a lot of programming. I mean, I've done a
00:16:22 decent amount. I did make half of an RPG, but, you know, I'm not super experienced. I haven't like
00:16:27 watched other people extensively. So I don't want to speak on anyone else's behalf, but on my own
00:16:32 behalf, I feel like what I was trying to do was to try to reduce the size of the list of how many
00:16:38 things to know by weaving them together in this tight package so that it would look smaller on
00:16:45 paper, like it would all be intricately woven, and therefore it's all organized and everything
00:16:49 connects. But connections are difficult to keep track of, and that if I just had the discipline
00:16:54 of just, you know, grind down until you're done with the list, then you did it. You know, just
00:17:00 study and practice. Basically, that's what it is. It's the difference between study and practice
00:17:05 versus trying to come up with a new method to cheat your way around it or get it more easily.
00:17:10 You know, you need both in your life, but, you know, keep in mind when one is appropriate and
00:17:15 the other is not appropriate. Yes, yes, yes. Going back to the whole, you know, feeling like I'm
00:17:27 falling apart from the PCP, which I no longer do. That's just, you know, sometimes an emo
00:17:31 bullshit, like feeling sometimes, which, you know, I think I won't have anymore. I'm gonna be perfect
00:17:36 from now on. But like, I guess I get afraid of that because I feel like I've been like that in
00:17:41 the past. I feel like as a kid, I was always like that because I've just, there just weren't people
00:17:44 who I liked enough to give a shit, you know? Like, again, you know, I was homeschooled and all,
00:17:51 but I had plenty of social interaction. Just like not, I guess most people in life, you're either
00:17:57 forced to hang out with the same people all the time because of school, so you just have to
00:18:01 fucking deal with it. Or you find people who you like and you can retreat into them, you know?
00:18:06 So I guess the difference is that I didn't have that forced to be around people who I don't want
00:18:12 to be around. Like I could just, in my life was, my life has always, has always been pretty dang
00:18:16 modular. You know, I've always been able to do what I wanted to and work on what I wanted to.
00:18:22 So I guess the positive is that, that it makes me like really accustomed to the idea of just being
00:18:28 like, hey, I'm gonna, I just decided to jump on YouTube and it's, it's pretty easy for me to just
00:18:33 suddenly start devoting all my time to it or suddenly start devoting all my time to one thing
00:18:37 or another because I've never, never been constrained by, you know, the schooling method
00:18:42 because it's like if you do homeschooling, you can just, you can kind of crank out the work
00:18:46 pretty quickly. And yeah, I mean, it depends on your parents, but that's kind of how it was for me.
00:18:53 You know, I did a, I did a pretty mediocre to bad job with schooling, which I, if I had gone
00:18:59 to a public school, I would have done almost certainly the same bad job, but over a much longer
00:19:05 period of time stretched out over the course of every day. Whereas, you know,
00:19:10 at home, it was just a couple hours of feeling like I'm shitting around and being stupid.
00:19:17 But yeah, my point is, yeah, like the benefit that the pro is that I always felt able to just
00:19:24 like jump on something and just start doing it. And I've just, it's easy for me to have the focus
00:19:28 on things that I want to do. But the downside is there are a lot of things that you're sort of
00:19:32 supposed to go through as a frustration in life that I just avoid. I don't know, maybe that's,
00:19:38 I guess that's also a pro, but you know, it just, it just means that there are certain things that
00:19:41 like I never had to deal with as a child. And like part of it is having to hang out with the same
00:19:47 people who you hate all the time. If there were people who I hated, I could just stop hanging
00:19:51 out with them. But yeah, like there was, um, there was one church I went to from like ages 10,
00:19:58 11 through 12 that my parents went to this church and like they got bored of it and they left.
00:20:04 Like, I guess I get my misanthropy from my dad who always, you know, associates himself with
00:20:08 people and then like disconnects from them and eventually leaves. I feel like that would have
00:20:12 been my life if I hadn't discovered the, the, the, the pro crest and praetors people
00:20:18 who are people who I can like respect consistently and never get tired of,
00:20:23 except during ride gone to a little tiny bit. But anyway, that's beside the point.
00:20:27 Like anyway, in this church, like before my parents decided we should stop going there,
00:20:31 like, you know, they have a youth group thingy or like a tween group or whatever it was. And like,
00:20:36 I liked doing it because I liked being in there more than the adult church, because like it was
00:20:40 a small room where there was more audience participation and it was more direct to direct
00:20:45 to indirect. It wasn't like sitting in a giant auditorium and having a guy lecture you for three
00:20:49 hours, which by the way, I don't know if I remember, I remember one time I had a Catholic
00:20:54 friend on the internet who went to like a Baptist church one, one Sunday and he'd never realized
00:21:00 that like most churches that aren't Catholic, the sermons are like three hours long. I'm not
00:21:05 kidding. Apparently in Catholicism sermons are really short because the Catholics are like really
00:21:12 good at actually making their religion aesthetic and enjoyable on some level, I guess. Anyway,
00:21:19 yeah, so like three hours sermon with the adults and I was just like, this is terribly boring,
00:21:23 I hate it. But if, you know, with the youth group, I can at least feel more involved, you know, and
00:21:29 that's nice. But what really frustrated me is that like, like they would often be like, you know
00:21:34 what, we actually want the youth group to be with the adults this time because this message is important.
00:21:39 And I was like, okay, well, I hate this, but fair enough. But it just got to be to the point where
00:21:43 it was like 75% of the time, like three out of four Sundays, it honestly felt like three out of
00:21:49 four Sundays, they wouldn't do the tween group thing. Because because this message was just so
00:21:54 important. Honestly, I honestly now looking back on it, I just now had a suspicion that maybe the
00:22:00 guy who ran the tween group thing was just didn't want to do it most of the time and asking them
00:22:04 to excuse him out of it. I don't know. But that's probably not the case. They probably thought that
00:22:09 the messages were just that important that all the 11 year olds had to listen to it.
00:22:13 But anyway, what was really frustrating is that on the occasion I finally went to the
00:22:18 tween group thing, you know, it was more involved, but I didn't like the people there and they would
00:22:22 piss me off. And well, they only pissed me off twice, right? Well, no, they only pissed me off
00:22:27 once. Here's how it went. Like I just didn't like being there. I was just weird. I think this was,
00:22:32 I was going through my phase where I decided to like not wear underwear during the summer,
00:22:36 because I was like, my butt is sweating constantly. So I just don't wear underwear,
00:22:39 I won't feel it clinging to me. And then also during the winter, this was my period when I was
00:22:45 like, I just need to wear gloves all the time so that my hands don't get chapped. This was before
00:22:49 I discovered you could just put lotion on your hands and then your hands won't get chapped during
00:22:53 the dry season. At the time I was just like, I'm gonna wear gloves all the time. And you know,
00:22:58 I'm sure I'm awkward and like, it's like, I don't talk in ways that would make me seem natural,
00:23:03 but I do talk in ways that make me seem unnatural, you know, again, didn't really care about these
00:23:08 people or their opinion of me. It just made me feel like, okay, I just don't need to be here.
00:23:11 It just made me feel a little bit uncomfortable. Not really uncomfortable, just why am I here?
00:23:16 What am I doing? Right? I remember one time we were like, never mind, I won't get into like
00:23:23 time. There were just some times we were like, don't touch me or some kid was like, we're like,
00:23:27 one girl, we were like holding hands to pray and one girl was like, why do you wear gloves all the
00:23:31 time? And I don't remember what answer I gave. I think I think I probably just said, oh, because
00:23:35 my hands get chapped. So I just want to keep them warm all the time. But yeah, I probably came off
00:23:40 like a huge weirdo. But I don't think I was like that stand out for people to care that much,
00:23:45 you know, it's a bunch of 12 year olds, of course, they're all they're all probably feeling miserable
00:23:49 too. But like, there's one time where like, what happened, we had water cups, I just spilled the
00:23:56 water cup on my pants. And I was like, I'm frustrated, right? And like, you know, today, I just like,
00:24:01 oh, shit, I spilled water on my pants. But you know, at this time, I didn't have the maturity
00:24:05 to just do that. I was just like, Oh, God, I don't want anyone to see this. Like, I don't mind that
00:24:10 much. It's just that it stresses me out. So I went to the bathroom and I was just trying to dry it
00:24:14 off. And like, one of the teachers was like, Hey, what's up? Like, it was like a female girl person
00:24:19 woman who was like, she wasn't in the bathroom with me. But you know, like when I came out,
00:24:22 she's like, Is anything wrong? And like, and I was just I was just frustrated, right? I was just
00:24:27 frustrated at like, now I'm like spending 30 minutes just trying to dry my fucking pants off.
00:24:32 And instead of like, participating in whatever they're doing, which is probably going to be at
00:24:36 least somewhat stimulating, right? I don't want to be here anyway. And so I eventually walked back
00:24:41 in with the teacher lady. And like, everyone was just kind of silent for a second. And one girl
00:24:46 said, What's wrong? Are you constipated? And like, everyone laughed. Like, you know, the classic,
00:24:53 you know, laughing at the child in the classroom type of thing. And like, it didn't bother me.
00:24:58 It just amplified my why the fuck am I here? You know, I was just like, I don't I don't need you
00:25:04 people, right? Now, I must clarify that on one hand, I've never been someone who minds being
00:25:12 laughed at. Like for me, I was actually asked like last night, I was talking to my squiggle. And
00:25:19 the squiggle asked me like, what is what is like the your biggest fear? What's your biggest concern?
00:25:25 What's your biggest insecurity? And I said, people not finding me funny, me not being funny, that is
00:25:31 literally the only thing that could make me make myself image plummet into 0%. That's really the
00:25:37 only I could be terrible in every other way. But as long as people are laughing because of me, I'm
00:25:41 okay, I can live, right? And, and then like the question is raised, well, what about when people
00:25:48 are laughing at you? And I honestly sincerely don't mind. If if me, if my existence or my actions
00:25:55 causes amusement to people, then I legitimately, I legitimately appreciate it no matter what the
00:26:02 context is really. So like, the fact that everyone laughed at me, I don't mind. I really thought
00:26:08 like, huh, it is kind of, I mean, that was a funny quip. It was well timed, you know? But it just was
00:26:12 like, yeah, but I don't really feel welcome here. Again, I want to emphasize the laughing on its own
00:26:18 didn't bother me. It was just like thinking, I don't need to be here. I don't want to be here.
00:26:23 I was just kind of grumpy about it for like weeks. And eventually like that girl was like,
00:26:29 hey, sorry that I said that to you. I'm like, don't don't worry, I don't mind, you know, nice.
00:26:33 But then, oh God, the the like like a month later, you know, however many sessions of this later,
00:26:41 like we were doing a Thanksgiving thing. Hold on, Thanksgiving, that would mean that this was
00:26:49 like November, which would mean like a couple months prior would have been when I was still
00:26:54 wearing gloves during September. So maybe it was just cold all the time. Maybe my hands got
00:27:00 chapped all the time. Maybe it was just dry that year. I don't even know. No, no, it had to have
00:27:05 been cold. Maybe that maybe the kid thinking maybe the girl asked me why I wear gloves all the time
00:27:10 was from the last winter. And and now and this Thanksgiving story I'm about to tell was from
00:27:18 the the year that felt that followed afterwards. Man, I actually you know what it's starting to
00:27:26 trip me out. I don't remember like I'm like the dates of things are blurring together for me more
00:27:32 and more like I was realizing just last night I don't remember if I was 11 or 12 when I jacked
00:27:37 off for the first time. I literally cannot remember if it was 2005 or 2006. Like I'm pretty sure it
00:27:46 was 2005. But then it conflicts with other dates and timelines I have in mind. So it may have been
00:27:52 2006. And then there's a part of me that's like wait, was it 2007? Was I actually 13? I really,
00:27:59 really don't remember. And so much of the stuff that I did on the internet at the time I have
00:28:03 deleted long, long ago. So I won't I can't check. Anyway, this is you know the whole when you look
00:28:12 on back on this you'll laugh this story with this youth this tween group thing is definitely the case
00:28:17 with this. So it was a Thanksgiving thing. And basically the assignment is we're gonna make a
00:28:23 friggin. Oh, geez, it's like you're just gonna make like a card like a thing what you're oh yeah
00:28:30 what you're thankful for of course that's what Thanksgiving is for I don't remember that but
00:28:34 putting one and two together I'm sure that's what it was make a little card with arts and crafts
00:28:39 signifying what you're thankful for. So actually I just remember we were actually in that church
00:28:47 for longer than I can I remember because I was actually in the kids group before that but then
00:28:52 eventually I moved up to the tween group in the same church right so I was probably there for
00:28:57 three years or so but anyway yeah so yeah make a card of what you're thankful for and like
00:29:03 and they had little um okay where's those little cone shaped things for Thanksgiving where you put
00:29:08 like fruit in it or something and you put like stuff in it and it's Thanksgiving themed it's like a
00:29:14 it's like one of those bugles snacks but it's Thanksgiving and like you put stuff in it like
00:29:20 that's a Thanksgiving thing so part of what they were you know prompting for these cards is that
00:29:24 you know decorate them with one of those bugles I think they actually were literally using bugles
00:29:30 like the snack and you put the thing inside of them but it may have been little plastic things
00:29:34 and I just didn't really care that much so I was just like gluing you know you glue it to the card
00:29:39 and I just glue I glued the fruit outside of the bugle like I didn't like like everyone else like
00:29:46 I was just kind of messing around with it didn't really care but then like the other kids were like
00:29:50 oh you're not doing it right you know you're like like look see what we're doing like you're
00:29:55 gluing you're putting glue into the bugle and then you're putting the little plastic fruit ornaments
00:29:59 into the bugle to uh to make them stick and it looks real but I was just sticking the bugle to
00:30:05 the piece of paper and then sticking the fruit to the piece of paper outside of the bugle and I
00:30:11 didn't think of doing it the way that they were doing it but they were like legitimately like like
00:30:15 correcting me about it you know which is you know remember these are a bunch of 12 year old so of
00:30:21 course they were just like and like a couple and I was like uh no the way I'm doing it is perfectly
00:30:27 fine right like I'm I'm doing it I don't care you know like I think at the time I was probably
00:30:33 arguing oh this is more good like this is better the way I'm doing it like I don't and like and then
00:30:38 like when it got to the point that there was like two or three kids being like no no you're doing it
00:30:42 wrong you're doing it wrong I was like they weren't mad they were just trying to help me but they
00:30:46 were doing it in this know it all kind of attitude and so I was just like fuck this you know I didn't
00:30:52 say that I was just like I literally just turned around walked out of the room because you know it's
00:30:58 it's a church I mean for those who don't if you haven't been to a church or maybe you've gone to a
00:31:02 certain kind of church all the churches I've been to it's not it's pretty relaxed you can just kind
00:31:05 of wander around and you know whatever so but yeah the point is I wasn't doing anything like breaking
00:31:11 the rules I was just being kind of audacious I'm like why do I need to be here I don't need to be here
00:31:17 I walked out I was just like I was mad like why are they giving me shit over nothing and I walked out
00:31:21 the door and it was like storming down the hall and I remember specifically um like there was some
00:31:26 adult woman person talking to another adult woman person like what's going on oh he's having another
00:31:31 David's having another issue with the kids another issue like oh great this is what I am I'm the one
00:31:36 who has the issues right so I was just like so I never went there again I think that may have
00:31:41 actually spawned at the end of us going to that church like I mean I probably told my parents about
00:31:45 that and they were like okay let's stop going there you know because they didn't like it either they
00:31:49 didn't like the people there either oh god it's so funny oh so you know I remember also like much
00:31:59 younger at a different church we went to like a church camp thing and there was a point in time
00:32:03 where I just got pissed off at everybody and I just I just went into the tent and I zipped the
00:32:07 tent up and I was just mad and like some other kid was like man remember last year when like you
00:32:11 were so mad at everybody you like you zipped the tent up so that no one would get in I'm like
00:32:15 yeah I guess I just have I guess that's just my reputation at some point I get mad at everybody
00:32:19 and I just want to storm off right and I lose nothing because I have I have computers video games
00:32:25 and the internet eventually when I was like 13 and I started using the internet all the time
00:32:30 even as a kid I had the internet I just didn't use it much I you have the infinite universe
00:32:35 to explore I don't need I don't need useless people who are normal you know so I guess because
00:32:41 that's my pattern uh then when like I feel angsty towards the pcp I get paranoid like oh god am I
00:32:50 gonna emo out and leave because I would then legitimately be crushed you know I value this
00:32:56 association this affiliation way too much you know so I need to get the fuck over it man
00:33:07 okay um that's it I'm gonna keep this short again that was a pretty self-contained point
00:33:14 I have other notes but they're all things that will continue to be relevant as the weeks go on so
00:33:18 I don't want to squeeze this uh this my topics out too quickly uh yeah I'm planning on you know
00:33:28 still doing this every week probably maybe but okay on one hand I feel like if I force myself
00:33:34 to do one every week then I'm gonna run out and it's gonna be pointless and it would be better
00:33:38 if I just do it when I feel like doing it but the thing is pressuring myself to do it on a schedule
00:33:45 makes me want makes me like forces me to come up with ideas and to put it together in a good way
00:33:51 so I think I am going to commit myself to doing this you know what I'm gonna commit myself to
00:33:55 doing it once every other week yeah that's what I'm gonna do hopefully it's been like two weeks
00:34:01 since the last one yeah so yeah that that will officially be the schedule of this until further
00:34:06 notice the uh the voodoo hadron collider will be once every two weeks two weeks two weeks
00:34:15 will have lost the contract and oscorp will be dead sometimes it's gonna do things yourself
