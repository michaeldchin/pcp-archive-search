00:00:00 Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemail for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Redcon funded by you. We can be procrastinators.
00:00:16 Hello, and welcome to another episode of the PCP, The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm Ben Saint, and with me today, I have Tom Oliver. Thank you for joining me, Tom.
00:00:36 We're all about melodrama today, apparently. I would like to ask you, what is to be done about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Your thoughts.
00:00:52 I think we just need to line them all up in like a big line together, and then you just got to get like one semi-attractive looking woman to walk up to them, and then just be like, have a Red Bull, and they'll all be friends. That's what TV has taught me.
00:01:08 What? Wait, Red Bull doesn't make friends, it gives you wings.
00:01:16 Well, if they're wings, they'll all-
00:01:20 No, no, no. I think you're right, but it's got to be Mentos. It doesn't matter what comes, fresh goes better in life, and then like, oh, an Israeli, someone in the Israeli Defense Force, you know, he's like pounding-
00:01:34 That's the fresh maker, not the peacemaker.
00:01:37 He's like beating a child's head in with the butt of his rifle, but then like, you know, his little, like, his emaciated little, the Palestinian kids, like, emaciated little brother is like, wait, sir, it holds up a Mentos?
00:01:49 And he goes, ha, ha, ha, ha, and he takes some, and then they're like, ah, forget about it, ah, you little scamp. And that's- I could see it, I could see it.
00:02:01 Why aren't we in charge of international relations? We can get this all solved in a day.
00:02:05 The Mentos Trio. The Mentos Trio could have solved, could have, we could have had peace in the Middle East back when I was like 14.
00:02:15 Have I- Wait a second. I've mentioned the Mentos Trio before. Have I ever explained what that was?
00:02:23 Maybe. I'm only here for like half the episodes now, so.
00:02:26 That's true. That's true. Okay, I think I mentioned this once, but let me tell you about a period in my life.
00:02:33 When I was like- I'm going to be so embarrassed if I have told the story before and I just forgot.
00:02:39 But when I was like 12, 13, maybe a little younger even, I went to this summer camp.
00:02:47 Not a camp, really, but like a program for gifted children, because I was so smart.
00:02:54 That's what your parents told you, huh? That's what you're going?
00:02:57 I don't know. It was called College Academy, and it was basically like kids during the summer.
00:03:04 It was like- it was sort of like a mock college, like you would pick your classes, and then in the course of the day you would go between classes,
00:03:13 and then you go to lunch, and then you go to two more classes. It was sort of like pretend college for kids.
00:03:18 It's like a prepare yourself for the future kind of thing.
00:03:21 And you, a future cartoonist, needed this desperately.
00:03:24 Well, I had potential back then.
00:03:31 But on the bus ride to and from College Academy, I don't know, there were these older kids who I thought were so cool,
00:03:41 and like a couple years later, some of them would graduate, and eventually I joined their inner circle,
00:03:50 and they called themselves the Mentos Trio, and what they would do is they would sit at the back of the bus to College Academy,
00:03:59 and they would buy Mentos before every bus ride, and they would write- they would take paper, like a pencil paper,
00:04:07 and they would write like Mentos the Freshmaker on paper, and they would wait for the bus to stop at a red light and wait for a car behind the bus to pull up close,
00:04:17 and then they would like flip back and like look through the windows in the back of the bus and slam the paper on the back window,
00:04:22 and they would give thumbs up and big smiles and hold the Mentos like, yeah, Mentos, the Freshmaker,
00:04:28 and just see what the car behind them would do, and that was it. That was the Mentos Trio.
00:04:36 And these are the people you thought were cool.
00:04:38 Listen, they had passion.
00:04:41 You know, I can't deny that. This sounds like something out of a webcomic.
00:04:45 This sounds like something that could be in Tales Against Troll or something, and I would believe it.
00:04:48 It does. It's pretty zany. It's pretty wacky.
00:04:53 Ben, do you think it became a cartoonist because your entire childhood was just something out of an early 2000s webcomic?
00:04:59 No, no. I thought it was normal back then.
00:05:05 But sometimes you get good reactions, though.
00:05:09 Sometimes there was one guy who flipped us off and then peeled out in a U-turn, like he was mad.
00:05:17 Most of the time, people would either just ignore it or sometimes people would give thumbs up back.
00:05:23 That was the most common thing, as you might expect.
00:05:28 Yeah, you're just playing the long game to get those golden reactions, either positive or negative, I suppose.
00:05:33 Gotta wade through the shit.
00:05:35 Ah, it was good times. It was good times.
00:05:38 I think they thought I was a loser because I was a little kid, but then a couple of them graduated and they were like,
00:05:45 well, we have to let Ben join because there's no longer three of us.
00:05:50 Oh man, can't be the Mentos duo. That's just not nearly as good.
00:05:54 That's just lame, no. The people behind the bus would laugh at us.
00:05:59 The balance between base and cringe is that three-person dynamic.
00:06:04 That's it. If there's only two of you, you just look like some weird lone losers, right?
00:06:10 But you can't get a third person to join your little Mentos cult?
00:06:13 Three's a crap, so then it's the cool thing to do.
00:06:15 For just two people, just like, oh god, those sad, pathetic young men.
00:06:20 It's just a tray, and what were the shooter's names?
00:06:29 I know, I don't.
00:06:31 From the Columbine, the Columbine shooters.
00:06:34 Why do you think I would know the shooter's names from Columbine?
00:06:37 I don't know, they're famous.
00:06:39 I know the names of the last five Ultraman, I don't know, the Columbine shooters.
00:06:45 My knowledge is very fucked up.
00:06:49 It was Trey Parker and Matt Stone, I believe.
00:06:52 Oh, right, that was the duo that you joined to become the Mentos trio.
00:06:56 And who then went on to shoot up Columbine, famously.
00:06:59 Yeah, you know.
00:07:01 If you want to get a show on Comedy Central, you got to really prove that you're committed to the bit.
00:07:07 Good times, good times.
00:07:11 Okay, so now, that's pretty much it.
00:07:15 There's nothing else to say about the Mentos trio, but that was the deal with it.
00:07:19 I was not familiar with that story, so you at least never told me it before.
00:07:23 Good, good, good, good.
00:07:28 Me and Gib did the bonus episode this week.
00:07:33 We did the Minesweeper challenge.
00:07:38 We did the Minesweeper, I guess, race or battle or whatever.
00:07:42 Which you can see for $5 a month over on patreon.com slash the procrastinators.
00:07:49 I got to say, I think that that bonus episode, it has twists and turns.
00:07:57 Was it better than the Dark Souls race?
00:08:01 Well, the Dark Souls race.
00:08:03 You have to say yes, we're trying to sell this right now.
00:08:07 No, I could say that I can waffle and I don't have to commit to anything.
00:08:12 I can say, well, it's apples and oranges.
00:08:14 Well, it's a different kind of quality.
00:08:18 It's better than the Yellow episode, for sure.
00:08:22 It's better than the Dark Souls race.
00:08:24 It's better than the Pokemon race.
00:08:26 It's better than what's the most viewed video on our channel.
00:08:32 I don't know.
00:08:34 It used to be the DigiTrixie calls Mumkey, the one where she explains why Mumkey was kicked.
00:08:46 That was the most popular for a while.
00:08:48 For a long time.
00:08:50 For a year or more.
00:08:52 That explains a lot, I guess.
00:08:54 And then I think finally, we were like, guys, we don't want this here.
00:08:59 This sucks.
00:09:01 All the lectures that are on here had less views than that.
00:09:04 Wait a minute.
00:09:06 Wait a minute, that might be right.
00:09:08 That might have been the most popular after the lectures, actually.
00:09:11 Okay, okay.
00:09:13 That's a little better.
00:09:15 Why the most?
00:09:17 Oh my God, it's both your lectures are the most popular.
00:09:20 Yeah, by a wide margin.
00:09:22 Oh my God, am I the king of this channel now?
00:09:25 That was a ground-breaking piece of content.
00:09:30 It was the video that set the trend.
00:09:33 It was the video that set the trend.
00:09:35 It was the video that set the trend.
00:09:37 It was the video that set the trend.
00:09:39 It was the video that set the trend.
00:09:41 It was the video that set the trend.
00:09:43 It was the video that set the trend.
00:09:45 It was the video that set the trend.
00:09:47 It was the video that set the trend.
00:09:49 It was the video that set the trend.
00:09:51 It was the video that set the trend.
00:09:53 It was the video that set the trend.
00:09:55 You know, it was.
00:09:57 It was.
00:09:59 Man, it'd be really great if there was another one.
00:10:03 If there was a follow-up to that, God, it just seems like it's about time.
00:10:07 If only that existed.
00:10:09 It is time.
00:10:11 It is time.
00:10:13 I've been feeling bad about that.
00:10:15 I have...
00:10:17 Well, I have...
00:10:19 I hope I'm not giving the game away here.
00:10:21 But I mean, I need to get my secret project done
00:10:25 before I want to release that.
00:10:27 I feel like...
00:10:29 I feel a little bit like zonked out.
00:10:31 I feel a little bit like...
00:10:33 I don't know what's going on.
00:10:35 I don't know what's going on in the news.
00:10:37 I don't know what I should be angry about this week.
00:10:39 The last two days, I've done basically nothing except work on that.
00:10:43 And it's...
00:10:45 Which is good.
00:10:47 Which is what I should be doing.
00:10:49 I've said this before, but it's probably stupid.
00:10:53 Objectively, it's probably stupid that I haven't released that yet.
00:10:57 But there is a reason why I need it released in a particular order.
00:11:03 Maybe not a good one, a reason that anyone would agree with.
00:11:07 But there is a reason.
00:11:09 At least you have a game plan and you're sticking to it, I guess.
00:11:13 I do.
00:11:15 The commenters will let us know if they respect that decision in any way, shape, or form.
00:11:21 I do think that...
00:11:23 I think originally I wanted...
00:11:25 Okay, I want to make posting that an event.
00:11:29 I want to attach with it an announcement that I was going to do.
00:11:33 Maybe some kind of...
00:11:35 I was thinking I will read every issue of Sonichu on my Twitch channel
00:11:41 to raise money for charity or something.
00:11:43 To make a big event out of it.
00:11:45 I don't know if I want to do that anymore.
00:11:47 Part of me is just like...
00:11:49 When it's time, I'm maybe just going to say fuck it.
00:11:51 Just put it out there who cares.
00:11:53 It could be fun.
00:11:55 Depends how much extra effort it would require.
00:11:59 You'd have to have special guests, Christine Westin Chandler, to show up.
00:12:03 To voice themselves in the comic.
00:12:05 She's been on my channel before.
00:12:07 I know. It's not outside the realm of possibility.
00:12:13 If you really wanted to raise money for charity, that's what you would do.
00:12:17 That would be the power move.
00:12:19 I don't know about it.
00:12:21 I don't know if the crowd that would be attracted by Chris being on a thing would be very likely to give anything to anyone.
00:12:31 I feel like people within your sphere, though, would be doubly invested in a situation like that.
00:12:39 Maybe.
00:12:41 Maybe.
00:12:43 It's possible.
00:12:45 Every time I do or say a Chris-related thing,
00:12:49 there's a new crop of people that show up to be like,
00:12:55 Chris, get a job!
00:12:59 Chris, get a job, Chris!
00:13:01 Fuck's sake!
00:13:03 It's never going to happen.
00:13:05 I don't think so.
00:13:07 It's just unhirable.
00:13:09 Some people are unhirable.
00:13:11 Some people are just dedicated to other people
00:13:15 need to get jobs, raise kids, and have families.
00:13:19 Some people are angry when people don't do that.
00:13:23 These people come out of the woodwork
00:13:27 when Chris is being discussed on the internet.
00:13:31 It's funny how these people are berating Chris
00:13:33 or just doing the same thing over and over again,
00:13:37 wasting their time chasing an impossible goal
00:13:39 when they themselves are chasing the impossible goal
00:13:43 of getting him to stop doing that.
00:13:45 We're getting her to stop doing that, I should say.
00:13:47 So they're both committed to the same hubris.
00:13:51 They're like Batman and the Joker.
00:13:53 They're two sides of the same coin.
00:13:55 One can never defeat the other.
00:13:57 That's true.
00:13:59 They need each other.
00:14:01 It's a symbiotic relationship.
00:14:03 I mean, it's kind of true.
00:14:05 Without the trolls, what would Chris be?
00:14:07 I mean, so much of Sonichu is about dealing with trolls.
00:14:13 It's true.
00:14:15 Sonichu would be nothing.
00:14:17 What she conceives to be trolls, yeah.
00:14:19 It makes you think really thought-provoking.
00:14:25 What else was I gonna...
00:14:31 I'm like, hey, what's...
00:14:33 Tell me something.
00:14:35 Well, I did it.
00:14:39 I did the thing.
00:14:41 I watched the Snyder Cut of Justice League,
00:14:44 because it came out on Friday.
00:14:46 I watched the whole thing, all four hours in one sitting.
00:14:51 I have been hearing about the Snyder Cut.
00:14:57 And I don't want to...
00:14:59 I mean, I didn't see the original movie,
00:15:01 so I'm not gonna watch the Snyder Cut either.
00:15:03 I would not watch it if you did not see the original.
00:15:05 In fact, no one should really watch it at all,
00:15:08 but it was just one of those things where it's like,
00:15:10 I'm so curious as what...
00:15:12 I saw a Stereo's Coconut on Twitter said
00:15:16 that he did think the Snyder Cut was better than the original.
00:15:19 I agree. I think it was better.
00:15:21 It was more, as strange as this to say,
00:15:24 it was more cohesive just because there was one person
00:15:27 in charge of the vision than the studio meddling hodgepodge
00:15:32 that was the theatrical cut, because of course I saw that too.
00:15:35 There is a video by Foldable Human.
00:15:39 Do you know who that is?
00:15:41 No, but that's a terrifying username.
00:15:45 He used to use a little cardboard box puppet
00:15:51 as sort of his mouthpiece, as sort of his avatar.
00:15:55 He just dropped Dan Olson.
00:15:57 He's dropped that for a long time,
00:15:59 but I think that was originally why he was called Foldable Human.
00:16:02 Now it just sounds lovecrafty and terrifying.
00:16:05 You know, I've never thought of it like that,
00:16:08 but I guess I could see what you mean.
00:16:12 But he made a video about folding ideas.
00:16:16 Folding ideas is what the channel is called.
00:16:18 Oh, okay. I've heard of folding ideas. Yeah, yeah.
00:16:20 Oh, okay, okay.
00:16:21 Well, he made a video about the Snyder Cut a year or more ago
00:16:24 saying it doesn't exist.
00:16:26 There is no completed Snyder Cut.
00:16:29 So I don't know.
00:16:31 People have been calling for the Snyder Cut for years,
00:16:36 but the Snyder Cut now, it's not something that existed all along.
00:16:41 It's like, it must have been something that was made in response to the outcry.
00:16:46 From what I've read is that only, like, okay.
00:16:50 So the original Cut, I think, was under two hours at the theatrical release.
00:16:53 And almost, like half of it was just new footage they re-shot with Joss Whedon.
00:16:59 And then this version that just came out is four hours and two minutes.
00:17:03 And only five minutes of that was new footage.
00:17:06 Everything else that was replaced was footage that was cut from the original version.
00:17:10 So there's, like, I think an hour and 45 minutes of footage from the original version that got cut.
00:17:17 Does the Snyder Cut not include the Joss Whedon stuff?
00:17:21 No, none of the Joss Whedon stuff is in the Snyder Cut.
00:17:23 It's all just the original stuff.
00:17:25 Because, like, there was, like, over two hours of shit they cut from the theatrical release
00:17:31 or in place with the Joss Whedon things.
00:17:33 And then they re-tweeted a lot of stuff.
00:17:35 So, yeah, it was, it's kind of dumb just because, like, you, it's like, okay,
00:17:41 for four years people have been clamoring for the Snyder Cut.
00:17:44 And they release it and it's clear that you watch it.
00:17:47 It's like, oh, this was a part one.
00:17:49 So it kind of ends super open for, like, all this new stuff that you just know is not going to happen.
00:17:56 And, like, the five minutes of new footage was, like, the cliffhanger ending of this movie.
00:18:01 It's like, so you recorded a stinger for a movie that you know is not going to get made?
00:18:07 Like, it was really fucking weird.
00:18:10 Hmm, I see, I see.
00:18:13 Because, like, spoilers, at the end, like, Martian Manhunter shows up and he's like,
00:18:16 hey, Batman, I'm Martian Manhunter.
00:18:18 I'm gonna help you fight.
00:18:19 And Batman's like, cool.
00:18:21 And then it ends and it's like, oh, I can't wait to never see this movie
00:18:24 where Martian Manhunter exists.
00:18:26 Awesome.
00:18:29 I saw a tweet from Brianna Joy Gray.
00:18:35 I think she was watching the Snyder Cut.
00:18:37 And someone said, she said, like, I guess Martian Manhunter shows up
00:18:45 and Ben Affleck goes like, who the fuck are you?
00:18:48 And she said, like, thank you.
00:18:50 I was wondering too.
00:18:52 And then she said, Martian, the name Martian Manhunter is so descriptive
00:18:57 without being clarifying at all.
00:19:00 Yeah.
00:19:01 Like, if you don't, like, if you don't know who that is.
00:19:03 This cut of the movie would never have worked in theaters
00:19:08 because it just drops a ton of, like, comic lore without any explanation
00:19:14 and doesn't try and make it any way approachable.
00:19:17 Like, Darkseid's just there, like, trying to get to Earth
00:19:20 and he's like, I need to go to Earth.
00:19:22 It has the anti-life equation.
00:19:24 And, like, they don't explain what the anti-life equation is
00:19:26 or what it means.
00:19:28 It's just a bunch of, like, CG monsters talking about this thing
00:19:31 for, like, two hours.
00:19:33 And it just assumes that, like, you've read comic books,
00:19:35 like, you know what the anti-life equation is
00:19:37 and why Darkseid wants it, right?
00:19:39 And it's pretty funny.
00:19:41 That's, I mean, I guess that's what the hardcore fans want.
00:19:45 So, like, it sounds like, it sounds like some people
00:19:50 will be pretty pleased about that, I guess.
00:19:52 I mean, like, in the original, in, like, the theatrical cut,
00:19:54 like, that came out first, the whole back end of the movie
00:19:57 is, like, the main, like, throwaway villain guy Steppenwolf.
00:20:01 He, like, sets up a base in this, like, abandoned, like,
00:20:04 Russian town that has, like, a couple people in there
00:20:06 and the whole fight is happening while they're trying
00:20:08 to, like, evacuate the people that are living in this town.
00:20:11 I think some cute little fucking, like, one-liners
00:20:14 and, like, funny scenes of, like, the Flash pushing
00:20:17 this truck away of, like, these, like, old couple
00:20:19 and then Superman's, like, carrying an entire building
00:20:22 and he's like, oh, I feel shitty because I'm not a strong
00:20:24 Superman, like, dumb shit like that.
00:20:26 And the Snyder Cut, there's, it's just an abandoned town
00:20:29 and nobody's there, so they destroy the entire fucking thing
00:20:32 in this fight and it's so much, such a different tone
00:20:35 and, like, of course, everything's shot in the dark
00:20:37 in this version and in the original theatrical cut
00:20:39 it was all brightened up and stuff and for some reason
00:20:42 when Superman comes back, he wears a black suit
00:20:45 but they changed it back to the normal colors
00:20:47 in the original theatrical cut, but in this one,
00:20:49 he's just wearing a black costume just because
00:20:52 Zack Snyder, I guess?
00:20:54 Was he given the comics or...
00:20:56 I mean, he did have a black costume in the comics.
00:20:58 I don't know if that was a reference to that or...
00:21:00 It was just strange because there was no reason for him
00:21:03 to wear another costume because, like, in the movie,
00:21:06 they go on to, like, a Kryptonian ship
00:21:08 and it has, like, his normal costume in there
00:21:10 but, like, he just wears black because I guess it's cooler?
00:21:13 I don't know.
00:21:15 The whole movie's in 4.3 also.
00:21:17 It is cooler.
00:21:18 That's probably the weirdest, most jarring thing
00:21:20 because there was a bunch of articles.
00:21:22 4.3 is like...
00:21:23 The Snyder Cut is?
00:21:24 Yeah, the Snyder Cut's in 4.3 aspect ratio,
00:21:25 not widescreen.
00:21:27 Why?
00:21:28 I think it was because originally it was shot
00:21:31 in a different aspect ratio for IMAX theaters
00:21:35 and, like, instead of, like, trying to adjust it
00:21:38 for 16x9, like, because I think widescreen
00:21:41 or IMAX is taller or something, I don't know,
00:21:43 I didn't look into it too much, but, like, yeah,
00:21:45 it's all in 4.3, the entire thing.
00:21:48 Speaking of...
00:21:50 Not to force a subject change,
00:21:54 but speaking of 4.3 aspect ratio,
00:21:57 I've been watching a lot of, or I've been mostly listening to,
00:21:59 a lot of Ross's Game Dungeon recently, you know that?
00:22:02 From Accursed Farms, the YouTube channel?
00:22:05 No. What is that?
00:22:07 Well, I mean, it's just, like, videos that a guy makes
00:22:11 where he talks about games, and, like, a lot of the games
00:22:14 that he plays are, like, a lot of older stuff.
00:22:17 It's not all older stuff, but a lot of older stuff.
00:22:19 Like, stuff like the Commodore 64 or the Amiga,
00:22:22 but also stuff, like, older classics, stuff like,
00:22:25 like, Deus Ex, the original Deus Ex and stuff.
00:22:30 Weird, like, point-and-click adventure games.
00:22:32 He plays a lot of point-and-click adventure games
00:22:34 that I've never heard of.
00:22:36 The reason I heard about this channel was because
00:22:38 when I made the lecture about Jennifer Dane writes,
00:22:43 a lot of people, I talked about that old game she made,
00:22:46 Boppin, and I guess Ross's Game Dungeon had,
00:22:49 from years ago, Ross's Game Dungeon had an episode about Boppin,
00:22:53 and a lot of people had heard of Boppin before from that.
00:22:56 I see.
00:22:59 Okay, Ross is very...
00:23:02 He does, like, text stuff.
00:23:05 He says he's not good with computers,
00:23:07 but he's way better with them than me.
00:23:09 Like, he will, like, emulate games,
00:23:11 and he will, like, go into the code
00:23:13 and, like, hack it specific...
00:23:15 I don't know if it's hacking, but, you know,
00:23:17 he will modify the code to make games, like, play in widescreen,
00:23:21 even if they, like, natively run in 4.3.
00:23:24 He, like, hates games that don't run in widescreen,
00:23:27 and he will, like...
00:23:29 He will take, like, pains to make these, like,
00:23:32 old, like, Windows 32-era game,
00:23:39 like, 3D games run on widescreen.
00:23:43 I don't know.
00:23:45 He's passionately against, like, shaders
00:23:49 that cause aliasing on pixels in games.
00:23:53 He gets, like, upset about that. I don't know.
00:23:55 Oh, like, like, anti-aliasing?
00:23:57 Like, smoothing out the pixels and stuff?
00:23:59 Yeah.
00:24:01 That's a huge pet peeve of mine, too,
00:24:03 but I've never gone and, like,
00:24:05 tried to put something in 16x9 that's in 4.3.
00:24:09 I don't mind the anti-aliasing.
00:24:11 That doesn't bug me too much.
00:24:13 Every time I play Doom, and, like,
00:24:15 it has the anti-aliasing on by default,
00:24:17 it smooths out all the sprites, and I'm just like,
00:24:19 no, I want my pixels.
00:24:21 Wait, so, no, no,
00:24:23 what he hates is when
00:24:26 like, um,
00:24:28 is when the pixels aren't smoothed.
00:24:30 Oh, my God.
00:24:32 What a monster.
00:24:34 Like, when, well, he'll, like,
00:24:37 there's a video, a clip that he shows sometimes,
00:24:39 there's, like, power lines,
00:24:41 and there's wires going between the power lines,
00:24:43 and the pixels on the power line are anti-aliased,
00:24:47 so they're all, like, individual pixels,
00:24:49 and they kind of, like, fizzle and, like, pop in and out, right?
00:24:52 As you move your field of view,
00:24:54 and, like, the tiny little wire moves across the screen.
00:24:57 You know what I'm saying?
00:24:59 Uh, sort of.
00:25:01 Uh, okay, I don't know.
00:25:04 I would have to find the screenshot.
00:25:06 It's just the low resolution.
00:25:08 They were just fucking with it.
00:25:10 And, like, a texture looks like it's all, like,
00:25:13 staticky, right, as you move,
00:25:15 because the pixels are, like,
00:25:17 yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:25:19 I like pixels.
00:25:21 I like when old games look fucked up.
00:25:23 Yeah, I mean, it's good.
00:25:25 You have to, that's, like, part of the aesthetic.
00:25:28 Ugh.
00:25:30 I don't know, he'll play these fucking, like,
00:25:32 20-year-old games and be like,
00:25:34 ah.
00:25:35 Why does this not look like a modern game?
00:25:37 I have to, I have to, I have to, though,
00:25:40 he's like, this isn't good.
00:25:42 I gotta go in and, like, modify the game's code
00:25:45 and, like, lock the game to, like, a higher frame rate,
00:25:49 and, like, overclock my fucking processor
00:25:51 to, like, make the game run at 60 frames per second
00:25:55 when it originally ran at, like,
00:25:57 10.4 or whatever.
00:25:59 Uh...
00:26:00 Sure.
00:26:01 I don't...
00:26:02 He has, he just has such a completely, completely...
00:26:05 That must be a nightmare.
00:26:06 I know a lot of, like, early 3D games,
00:26:08 they would tie all their physics to frame rate.
00:26:10 So, like, you would have to, like,
00:26:12 completely, like, redo the whole physics engine
00:26:15 to get it to work.
00:26:17 He has such a completely different way
00:26:20 of engaging with the medium of video games.
00:26:22 That is an idea.
00:26:23 That is, uh...
00:26:27 I want to say autism, but no.
00:26:29 It's something.
00:26:30 I don't know.
00:26:31 It's that weird laser focus that people have
00:26:33 about certain specific things.
00:26:35 Yeah.
00:26:36 Yeah.
00:26:39 I, um...
00:26:40 I've been, I guess, I guess, binging it
00:26:43 because, um, I...
00:26:46 Have just been trying to...
00:26:48 Because I've been trying to crank out work
00:26:50 on the thing, on the secret thing,
00:26:52 and I just...
00:26:53 I've found that that's a good thing
00:26:55 that, like, I don't really need to pay attention to.
00:26:57 You know, that's, that's the hurdle.
00:26:59 That's the problem, is you want,
00:27:01 you want content to put on
00:27:03 to just be noise in the background
00:27:05 and the danger is that, oh, it'll be too interesting
00:27:08 and you'll find yourself having to, like,
00:27:10 pay attention to it instead of the work you want to be doing.
00:27:12 You know, I do that all the time.
00:27:14 I was doing that with critical role
00:27:16 and it just got too interesting
00:27:17 and so I just tabbed back over to it.
00:27:18 You just got to listen to, like, music.
00:27:20 Just, like, lo-fi, instrumental.
00:27:22 I don't like music.
00:27:24 Just something to occupy the sound space.
00:27:27 I'm just...
00:27:29 Music doesn't do that for me.
00:27:31 Music doesn't, like, occupy...
00:27:33 I mean, sometimes it does.
00:27:35 Sometimes I'll use, like, rainy mood
00:27:37 and I'll just put on, like, you know, like a thunderstorm,
00:27:39 like, on loop for, like, 30 hours and just do that.
00:27:41 Well, I use that to sleep.
00:27:43 I do that to sleep sometimes, too.
00:27:45 Just, like, some sort of ambient noise.
00:27:47 I don't know, just, like, real silence bothers me.
00:27:51 It's, like...
00:27:53 It doesn't bother me if I'm...
00:27:56 If I start working on something
00:27:58 and I actually, like, get into working on it,
00:28:01 it doesn't matter if, like, it's quiet or not.
00:28:04 I don't even notice.
00:28:06 But, like, when I'm starting,
00:28:08 I feel, like, it's, like, harder for me to start
00:28:12 because I feel, like, oh, it's quiet.
00:28:14 Like, my mind isn't occupied.
00:28:17 Like, something is...
00:28:19 I need something.
00:28:21 It's, like, the fact that there's no noise
00:28:24 or is, like, distracting almost.
00:28:26 Yeah.
00:28:28 Yeah, I guess that's how I'm gonna describe it.
00:28:30 I find that, like, in the beginning,
00:28:32 I need something to, kind of, like, occupy that part of my brain.
00:28:34 Then I'll get into it for a while,
00:28:36 like, usually within, like, a half an hour to 45 minutes,
00:28:39 my brain will start to drift, regardless of what I'm doing,
00:28:42 unless I'm, like, stuck on something.
00:28:44 If I'm having, like, a problem, like, my brain will just laser-focus
00:28:46 on trying to get that fixed while, like, raging.
00:28:48 But other than that, like, my brain always starts to drift.
00:28:51 And if I have something that's interesting on the background,
00:28:53 like, you know, like, Critical Role or, like, YouTube videos or something,
00:28:56 I'll just, like, drift back towards that
00:28:58 and forget what I was doing.
00:29:00 And then two hours later, I'm like,
00:29:02 why am I watching Best of the Worst Episode 75 for the fifth time?
00:29:04 I should be working.
00:29:06 So, like, music is just the safe thing,
00:29:08 because, like, I'll just open the tab,
00:29:10 and it'll be the little raccoon walking on the sidewalk,
00:29:12 and I'll be like, yep, she's still walking,
00:29:14 and then I can go back and do what I'm doing.
00:29:16 I'm supposed to be working.
00:29:18 Oh, it's so bad.
00:29:20 Now I'm supposed to be working right now.
00:29:22 I woke up today at 11, and I was like,
00:29:24 oh, I got, like, four hours to work on my secret project
00:29:26 before the podcast starts.
00:29:28 But then I didn't, and I went and got food,
00:29:30 and then I don't even know what happened.
00:29:32 The podcast is just the worst.
00:29:34 The podcast is a nightmare.
00:29:36 It fucks up your whole day, right?
00:29:38 It really is. It does for me.
00:29:40 It's in the middle of the day, so it's like,
00:29:42 it's not like you can get it out of the way early,
00:29:44 or it's not like you can wrap everything up before it at night.
00:29:46 It's just like, no matter what you start,
00:29:48 or when you start it, it interrupts it.
00:29:50 Yeah.
00:29:52 It's like, lately, I've seen a couple of, like,
00:29:54 you know, haha-relatable comics
00:29:56 that I have been, like,
00:29:58 yes.
00:30:00 I do, it is relatable
00:30:02 about, like,
00:30:04 I saw one that was, like,
00:30:06 you know, oh,
00:30:08 only I have to do something
00:30:10 in four hours.
00:30:12 Guess I can't, I can't do anything.
00:30:14 Yeah.
00:30:16 And the podcast does that every Sunday to me.
00:30:18 I can't do anything before, because, oh,
00:30:20 in, like, six hours from now, I have to do the podcast,
00:30:22 and then afterwards, like, oh, well,
00:30:24 I have to go to sleep in, like, five hours from now,
00:30:26 so I can't do anything.
00:30:28 I've been, like, trying to push myself through that,
00:30:30 but something that helped me is, like,
00:30:32 after I did the PCP,
00:30:34 I would usually also record the bonus podcast
00:30:36 I do for my patrons on Sunday as well.
00:30:38 It was, like, another hour on top of that,
00:30:40 and, like, I got to move this to another day.
00:30:42 Yeah.
00:30:44 Yeah.
00:30:46 I missed my
00:30:48 patron
00:30:50 podcast this month. I missed it.
00:30:52 I failed them.
00:30:54 But it's okay,
00:30:56 I made an announcement. I said,
00:30:58 yes, I missed the Q&A, yes, I missed the podcast.
00:31:00 However, however,
00:31:02 I'm going to do another one
00:31:04 after the secret thing is,
00:31:06 after the demo of the secret thing is done,
00:31:08 the, like, the semi,
00:31:10 the patrons only, like,
00:31:12 early version is done.
00:31:14 And then I'll do a Q&A
00:31:16 where I talk about that specifically.
00:31:18 So I have a plan.
00:31:20 It's all part of the plan.
00:31:22 I missed sending out the
00:31:24 merch package for this quarter
00:31:26 because I've been doing all these secret projects.
00:31:28 So I just said to everyone
00:31:30 on that tier on Patreon, I was like,
00:31:32 I'll just do a double, a double size
00:31:34 next quarter.
00:31:36 So in April, you'll get two t-shirts, two 3D prints,
00:31:38 four posters, and a bunch of other stuff
00:31:40 instead of the two and ones that I usually send.
00:31:42 I wanted to complain
00:31:44 about
00:31:46 problems I was
00:31:48 encountering on the work,
00:31:50 on the project with patrons
00:31:52 because, like, I'm only
00:31:54 talking to patrons about it.
00:31:56 But so I went into my Discord
00:31:58 because I have a patrons-only channel
00:32:00 and nobody was in there and I was like,
00:32:02 what is this? And I realized
00:32:04 that Discord patron integration
00:32:06 had been broken for, like, months.
00:32:08 What? Is it really?
00:32:10 Well, not in general,
00:32:12 just on my account.
00:32:14 Oh, shit, I rely on that too.
00:32:16 No, my account had just, like,
00:32:18 I had set it up before,
00:32:20 but, like, I look back and it just, like, isn't
00:32:22 there anymore. It, like, it didn't know
00:32:24 that my, it didn't have my
00:32:26 server attached, it didn't have the, like,
00:32:28 patron roles attached to it.
00:32:30 So I fixed that
00:32:32 and then I, and then
00:32:34 it dragged a bunch of people, like, into
00:32:36 my server who I think had been in there
00:32:38 and had left. I think they, like,
00:32:40 weren't interested in
00:32:42 but they came back
00:32:44 and so I had a captive audience
00:32:46 that I could complain to about,
00:32:48 ah, it's too hard, though.
00:32:50 It's too hard.
00:32:51 Half of them just, like, what the fuck are you talking about?
00:32:53 I haven't been in here for six months.
00:32:55 I got, um,
00:32:57 I got some, I got some helpful,
00:32:59 I actually got some helpful feedback from a couple of them.
00:33:01 Oh, yeah. It was pretty, it was good.
00:33:03 It helped me, it helped me cope.
00:33:05 I was seething, at first I was seething,
00:33:07 but afterwards I was
00:33:09 successfully coping, so
00:33:11 that was an improvement.
00:33:13 Excellent.
00:33:15 Uh,
00:33:17 yes.
00:33:19 I have too many secret projects right now.
00:33:21 I'm working on three
00:33:23 and a half secret projects all at the same time.
00:33:25 How do you,
00:33:27 you can't work on three at once.
00:33:29 I know, but, but I'm trying anyways.
00:33:31 It sucks.
00:33:33 What?
00:33:35 Why would you do this?
00:33:37 Because I only have
00:33:39 eight more years left before I turn
00:33:41 40 and I'm gonna kill myself
00:33:43 because no one should be allowed to be that old,
00:33:45 so I gotta, I gotta make these last,
00:33:47 this last,
00:33:49 less than a decade count.
00:33:51 We're gonna, we're gonna look like Prince Harry by then.
00:33:53 Oh, God.
00:33:55 Don't even say that.
00:33:57 Have you? Okay.
00:33:59 Every time I go on the internet,
00:34:01 I go on Twitter and I realize like
00:34:03 19 year olds are conscious.
00:34:05 I'm just like, I am irrelevant.
00:34:07 I am a fossil.
00:34:09 I should, I literally should be dead.
00:34:11 It's the worst feeling of all time.
00:34:13 Yeah.
00:34:15 I mean,
00:34:17 yeah.
00:34:19 Um,
00:34:21 it, it, it, I know what you mean.
00:34:23 I wouldn't, it, it wouldn't bother me.
00:34:25 It wouldn't bother me
00:34:27 except that
00:34:29 I don't
00:34:33 I don't know how
00:34:35 to, I don't know.
00:34:37 If I were still like
00:34:39 doing my, my work, whatever, doing what I do,
00:34:43 it would be fine.
00:34:45 Except that I feel like I haven't found any
00:34:47 new audience in a long time
00:34:49 and that really bothers me and I don't know what to do about it.
00:34:51 Well.
00:34:53 I'm not growing.
00:34:55 The fact that I'm old, the fact that I'm old doesn't,
00:34:57 doesn't bother me too much
00:34:59 except for the fact that oh, I've, I've gotten this
00:35:01 old and yet I feel like I have not
00:35:03 grown in a while. Ben. Am I,
00:35:05 am I stagnant now? No, it's because you're doing
00:35:07 the same thing that I am because it's the reason I haven't
00:35:09 grown in any fashion either
00:35:11 in the last like couple years is because
00:35:13 we're both doing secret projects.
00:35:15 Nobody knows what the fuck we're working on.
00:35:17 The way
00:35:19 to be successful is you have to broadcast
00:35:21 everything you're doing constantly.
00:35:23 That's true. That's true.
00:35:25 That's true.
00:35:27 My secret project,
00:35:29 I guess, I guess when mine is
00:35:31 done, I can probably hype it up to a certain
00:35:33 extent. I could see maybe
00:35:35 I could see maybe getting a little bit
00:35:37 of word of mouth buzz. I'm not keeping
00:35:39 my secret project secret until
00:35:41 it's done. I'm just keeping it secret until
00:35:43 it's at a state where there's something worth
00:35:45 presenting because especially one
00:35:47 of them right now is just so early
00:35:49 that it would be boring
00:35:51 to even talk about.
00:35:53 Well, I think mine
00:35:55 I think mine isn't actually going to take me.
00:35:57 I mean, if I were if I
00:35:59 keep working at the pace that I've been working
00:36:01 on the last couple days, I think
00:36:03 I think that like the early
00:36:05 version will be done this week and the
00:36:07 the final version
00:36:09 I mean who know. I mean, you know
00:36:11 it's one of those things where like I
00:36:13 could work on it for another year
00:36:15 and just keep like adding stuff, adding
00:36:17 stuff, adding stuff, but like I won't do that.
00:36:19 I think mine are going to take at least two years.
00:36:21 Oh, OK
00:36:23 mine's not like that. Mine's not that big.
00:36:25 It's a nightmare. Yeah.
00:36:27 That is a nightmare. Oh my God.
00:36:29 And that's like the first the first of three
00:36:31 like I have three projects I'm working on
00:36:33 right now, but the biggest of the three
00:36:35 is the smallest of a three part larger
00:36:37 secret project that will probably take 20 years.
00:36:39 20 years.
00:36:41 20 years.
00:36:43 20 years.
00:36:45 You can't you can't plan 20 years.
00:36:47 I'm not I'm not even thinking about the rest of it, but just
00:36:49 like thinking about like how slow I work.
00:36:51 There's not even going to be. Yeah, like I'm dead
00:36:53 in eight going to be in America in 20 years.
00:36:55 Yeah, yeah, exactly.
00:36:57 So that's never going to happen. So I'm not thinking about it, but.
00:37:01 Speaking.
00:37:02 Speaking of the collapse of America.
00:37:04 I did I did something.
00:37:06 I did something a little crazy.
00:37:08 I did something a little wacky. Oh, yeah.
00:37:10 I sold my Bitcoin.
00:37:12 Oh my God, really? Why?
00:37:14 I sold because
00:37:16 because I bought
00:37:18 some last month
00:37:20 with the plan that I would hold
00:37:22 until the stimmy thinking that the stimmy
00:37:24 would cause a bump.
00:37:26 Which didn't really happen,
00:37:28 but it went up anyway.
00:37:30 But you know, it was up to almost 62
00:37:32 and then it went down to like the mid 50s
00:37:34 and then it went back up to like the high 50s
00:37:36 and I was looking at this kind of wobbling
00:37:38 and I was like,
00:37:40 I expect a crash at some point.
00:37:42 I don't know if it'll be immediate,
00:37:44 but like sometime this year,
00:37:46 I expect that it will drop significantly.
00:37:48 And I think
00:37:50 I've gained a little bit.
00:37:52 I've gained I've made a little money
00:37:54 from the rise.
00:37:56 And the last time,
00:37:58 the last time I held,
00:38:00 you know, I could have just held and held and held,
00:38:02 but I also could have just sold
00:38:04 earlier and I would have made money there too.
00:38:06 The reason why I didn't make money earlier
00:38:08 was that I held too long.
00:38:10 And I was thinking maybe like, maybe now is the time
00:38:12 to like sell.
00:38:14 So I can lock in what gains I've made
00:38:16 and wait for,
00:38:18 I mean, it could be wrong, maybe there won't be any crash,
00:38:20 but if there is, maybe now is the time
00:38:22 to try and like beat it out.
00:38:24 So that's what I did.
00:38:26 I sold at about 58
00:38:28 on down a little bit since then.
00:38:30 It's at 57.4.
00:38:32 So I feel
00:38:34 I feel like,
00:38:36 I don't know.
00:38:38 I feel good. I feel good having sold.
00:38:40 I'm like, I'm kind of done.
00:38:42 I'm done with it for now.
00:38:44 I don't really
00:38:46 I don't understand why Bitcoin is so valuable
00:38:48 other than it was the first like the novelty
00:38:50 of it because like everything that's
00:38:52 happening in the crypto space seems to be built
00:38:54 on top of it.
00:38:56 So like, yeah, like the whole NFT thing
00:38:58 we're talking about last week, that's all built on top of Ethereum
00:39:00 and things like that. Like I was watching some stuff
00:39:02 about Ethereum in general and they were saying
00:39:04 how like Ethereum was built because
00:39:06 Bitcoin wasn't sophisticated
00:39:08 enough to build more
00:39:10 applications on top of it.
00:39:12 So Ethereum was built because
00:39:14 Bitcoin sucked and
00:39:16 for some reason, Bitcoin's worth like 60
00:39:18 times the amount and
00:39:20 it makes no sense.
00:39:22 Yeah, I think the common sense answer,
00:39:24 I think the obvious answer is the right one.
00:39:26 I just think it's the first one that more people know about.
00:39:28 Yeah, and that's it.
00:39:30 I think like
00:39:32 even though the first one
00:39:34 it's less sophisticated. Yeah, I think people just
00:39:36 don't understand crypto like including me.
00:39:38 So like anytime something cool with the blockchain
00:39:40 happens, I think people just attribute it to
00:39:42 Bitcoin, even though it probably has nothing to do with it.
00:39:44 Yeah, for sure.
00:39:46 Because I'm sure if you talked about NFTs to most
00:39:48 people, they'd be like, oh, the Bitcoin thing.
00:39:50 It's like, no, it has nothing to do with Bitcoin.
00:39:52 I don't know that until I go deeper and like started looking
00:39:54 at it. So I don't fucking know.
00:39:56 I keep thinking like maybe I should just
00:39:58 like start investing hardcore in Ethereum
00:40:00 because I feel like that's set to blow up
00:40:02 soon. But
00:40:04 this is the first time I've opened
00:40:06 my stock portfolio
00:40:08 in like a week and a half
00:40:10 and you know what?
00:40:12 I just stopped caring.
00:40:14 I'm in the red right now. I feel nothing.
00:40:16 It's okay.
00:40:18 Dogecoin is up
00:40:20 to 0.57.
00:40:22 So that means I still have up almost $300
00:40:24 of my initial investment.
00:40:26 Dogecoin...
00:40:28 Wait, is it up?
00:40:30 It looked like it was very gradually
00:40:32 trickling down.
00:40:34 It's trickling down right now.
00:40:36 From the last time I looked at my portfolio
00:40:38 it was at 0.5 last time I looked.
00:40:40 Now it's at 0.57.
00:40:42 Wait, what is Ethereum?
00:40:44 I'm trying to find my...
00:40:46 Okay, here's my
00:40:48 Ethereum to Bitcoin. I don't care about that.
00:40:50 What's Ethereum to USD?
00:40:52 Show me Ethereum to USD.
00:40:54 Ethereum is 1,796 currently.
00:40:58 It is...
00:41:00 Okay, it's...
00:41:02 It had the exact same bump
00:41:04 as Bitcoin did. They move almost
00:41:06 in lockstep.
00:41:08 On the 14th they both had
00:41:10 a pretty substantial little jump
00:41:12 and then hold and then like an equal drop afterwards.
00:41:14 That's why I think
00:41:16 people just
00:41:18 equivalent all
00:41:20 crypto stuff with Bitcoin. That's why
00:41:22 all the coins, all the altcoins
00:41:24 seems to just mirror it.
00:41:26 I don't know.
00:41:28 This is not legal financial advice.
00:41:30 I have no fucking idea what I'm talking about.
00:41:32 I'm just looking at tiny graphs on Robinhood.
00:41:34 It is literally
00:41:36 just that when people are
00:41:38 investing in one crypto
00:41:40 they are likely to invest
00:41:42 in others at the same time, right?
00:41:44 Is that why they move together?
00:41:46 I feel like cryptocurrency
00:41:48 reminds me a lot of Linux
00:41:50 and open source in general. It's totally open
00:41:52 so everybody can make their own versions
00:41:54 of it, but that just makes it so complicated
00:41:56 that most people don't understand.
00:41:58 It's like trying to explain
00:42:00 to somebody the difference between
00:42:02 Linux Mint and Debian.
00:42:04 Aren't they Linux? It's like, yeah,
00:42:06 but they're different in this way.
00:42:08 It's like trying to explain the difference
00:42:10 between Gabogubu and Dubugaba.
00:42:12 It's like, you know,
00:42:14 some people just don't understand what these things are.
00:42:16 Including me.
00:42:18 I just know that they're different. I don't know how.
00:42:20 Hey, guys, what's going on?
00:42:22 Hey!
00:42:24 We're talking about stupid shit.
00:42:26 We're talking about Bitcoin.
00:42:28 I sold all my Bitcoin.
00:42:30 Oh, you fucking fool.
00:42:32 It's going to go to the moon.
00:42:34 You fucking paper hands, paper hands.
00:42:36 It's going to...
00:42:38 I think it's going to crash sometime this year.
00:42:40 If it's going to crash, I want to be there when it happens.
00:42:42 What's GME at right now? I haven't looked at that.
00:42:44 Maybe down to like 30 or 40.
00:42:48 GME is still at 200 bucks.
00:42:50 Holy shit. You want to ride that rollercoaster?
00:42:52 Yeah, GME like fully recovered.
00:42:54 It makes me so mad.
00:42:56 For reference,
00:42:58 the money that I made
00:43:00 back from this latest Bitcoin rally
00:43:02 made up for about half
00:43:04 of what I lost in GME.
00:43:06 I was hoping it would fully recoup it,
00:43:08 but I would rather recoup half of it
00:43:10 than wait for a crash
00:43:12 and lose everything like I did last time.
00:43:14 If GME
00:43:16 tanks again, maybe I'll buy some.
00:43:18 There's apparently more life
00:43:20 in this fucking...
00:43:22 Whatever.
00:43:24 I would say something, but
00:43:26 what the fuck do I know?
00:43:28 I sold my GME at 50 bucks,
00:43:30 so don't listen to me.
00:43:32 Obviously, I'm an idiot.
00:43:34 I was saying like trying to understand
00:43:36 GME is like trying to understand
00:43:38 why a slot machine lands on all sevens.
00:43:40 It just seems completely arbitrary.
00:43:44 I mean, I know that the
00:43:46 second rise had to do with
00:43:48 the previous
00:43:50 president stepping down and a new one
00:43:52 taking over, but I have
00:43:54 no clue why that would cause the company
00:43:56 to quadruple in value.
00:43:58 What's so special about this guy?
00:44:00 Maybe he's a good president,
00:44:02 a good executive.
00:44:04 I think before he became the president of the company,
00:44:06 he bought a fuck ton of the shares
00:44:08 and then I know
00:44:10 they landed a big deal with Microsoft.
00:44:12 They got a big cash
00:44:14 infusion for Microsoft and now they have
00:44:16 this partnership where all
00:44:18 Xboxes sold through GameStop,
00:44:20 they get a cut of all digital sales from
00:44:22 that console and shit like that, so there's
00:44:24 a big deal they're working on right now.
00:44:26 Okay, that makes a little more sense.
00:44:28 Okay.
00:44:30 All right.
00:44:32 Yeah, I don't fucking know.
00:44:34 Money is dumb and I hate it.
00:44:38 I mean, I love money,
00:44:40 but I hate how much I love it.
00:44:42 I love money, but I hate markets.
00:44:48 I like markets
00:44:50 for non-essential
00:44:52 things.
00:44:54 I think markets are good in the abstract
00:44:56 when they're not tied to
00:44:58 an inelastic
00:45:00 demand, things like
00:45:02 food and healthcare.
00:45:04 What are these things you're saying?
00:45:06 I'm talking about
00:45:08 I love rubber bands.
00:45:10 I'm doing Voshism, I'm doing market socialism.
00:45:12 Vote for Biden.
00:45:14 If I use
00:45:16 words big enough that I've heard on live streams,
00:45:18 people will think I know what I'm talking about.
00:45:20 I'm sorry, I don't have an opinion about that.
00:45:22 Vosh hasn't done a stream on it yet.
00:45:24 I won't.
00:45:26 I refuse.
00:45:28 Unironically, there are tons of people who think like that.
00:45:30 I know, I know.
00:45:32 For a minute there,
00:45:34 I was on a Destiny kick and then a Vosh kick,
00:45:36 but I'm over it.
00:45:38 I haven't even been keeping up with my favorite
00:45:40 breadtuber, Big Joel.
00:45:42 Big Joel?
00:45:44 Big Joel, I love Big Joel.
00:45:46 Big Joel and Destiny got into a big fight.
00:45:48 That was pretty funny.
00:45:50 I didn't watch the stream,
00:45:52 but I saw Big Joel's tweets about it
00:45:54 and Destiny seems like a huge asshole.
00:45:56 Destiny was being
00:45:58 a huge but
00:46:00 he was just sort of...
00:46:02 As far as I remember,
00:46:04 it was Joel having a take
00:46:06 on something and Destiny
00:46:08 they had a back and forth
00:46:10 and they disagreed whatever, but afterwards
00:46:12 Joel was like, well, that was that
00:46:14 and I don't agree with Destiny
00:46:16 and Destiny said Joel was a fucking
00:46:18 scum-fuck piece of shit for
00:46:20 saying that on Twitter afterwards.
00:46:22 Like he's a lying scum-fuck
00:46:24 and I was like, Destiny,
00:46:26 you are using words that are so
00:46:28 overblown for the situation all the time.
00:46:30 I saw the tweets
00:46:32 that were posted afterwards and it seemed like
00:46:34 cause he was trying to be conciliatory
00:46:36 on stream and then he got off and said
00:46:38 this sounds so... I guess if you want to
00:46:40 care about your fucking CD player
00:46:42 or something, I think there's something like
00:46:44 you know what? I'm talking about this
00:46:46 and I realized that A
00:46:48 it meant so little to me
00:46:50 that I barely remember the circumstances
00:46:52 and B, I don't give a single fuck
00:46:54 so I...
00:46:56 I'm invested in Big Joel
00:46:58 I'm invested in Big Joel
00:47:00 I'm pro-Joel and anti-Destiny now
00:47:02 so I'm committed, I have a team
00:47:04 I've been going back and forth on Destiny
00:47:06 I mean, for a while there
00:47:08 I thought after that big row
00:47:10 he and Vosh had about
00:47:12 where Destiny just seems so
00:47:14 unreasonable and so unwilling
00:47:16 and I was just like
00:47:18 you piece of shit
00:47:20 I don't like you now
00:47:22 and then I watched another video of his
00:47:24 where he was like
00:47:26 converting like a
00:47:28 right-leaning person's
00:47:30 perception of... That's old Destiny
00:47:32 That's where Destiny is good
00:47:34 Old Destiny was good
00:47:36 No, it wasn't old
00:47:38 It was a very recent stream
00:47:40 So almost like people are nuanced
00:47:42 and you can agree with certain positions
00:47:44 and disagree with other positions
00:47:46 I mean, that's like
00:47:48 if he's talking to a right-winger
00:47:50 then obviously he seems good
00:47:52 in comparison but then he talks to
00:47:54 like a socialist and he's like
00:47:56 but actually, you know
00:47:58 Deadly Force should be used
00:48:00 by the state
00:48:02 by the state in support
00:48:04 of capital or whatever
00:48:06 It's just that I feel like
00:48:08 his methods of
00:48:10 being the way he is
00:48:12 speaks more to
00:48:14 right-leaning people
00:48:16 and gets them to engage with ideas
00:48:18 they wouldn't otherwise engage with
00:48:20 more so than like other
00:48:22 like Worsh
00:48:24 Worsh does it as well but
00:48:26 when Destiny talks to
00:48:28 a right-leaning person
00:48:30 they're more likely...
00:48:32 Is Destiny the first stop
00:48:34 on the alt-left pipeline?
00:48:36 I think for a lot of people he is
00:48:38 because like
00:48:40 the whole John Tron thing
00:48:42 got a lot of people who are just fans of John Tron
00:48:44 and not political in any way
00:48:46 to like
00:48:48 at first they were mad at him
00:48:50 but if they actually watched it they'd be like
00:48:52 oh John, that doesn't sound right
00:48:54 then they start to doubt
00:48:56 the people they idolize
00:48:58 and then that gets a lot of people thinking different
00:49:00 If I can't trust John Tron then
00:49:02 what's left for me?
00:49:04 Well, I was so hesitant to like
00:49:06 hate on John Tron
00:49:08 at all, I didn't really do any of that stuff
00:49:10 and he was funny
00:49:12 cause like it's John Tron
00:49:14 cause it's John Tron, like he's not a bad guy
00:49:16 like he's a funny guy
00:49:18 he's just a chubby funny guy
00:49:20 He's not technically a white nationalist
00:49:22 he just says the things that they say
00:49:24 He would never say anything terrible
00:49:26 he can't like
00:49:28 he can't have like any like fucked up ideas
00:49:30 or anything
00:49:32 because if he did
00:49:34 that would mean that such things
00:49:36 they're like deeply ingrained in our culture
00:49:38 in a way that's like invisible and insidious
00:49:40 and that would be fucked up
00:49:42 It would
00:49:44 So I think Destiny has
00:49:46 has worth in that
00:49:48 aspect of like moving people to the left
00:49:50 generally on a lot of other things
00:49:52 he's kind of
00:49:54 an annoying asshole
00:49:56 He's a lib, it's literally just the problem
00:49:58 is that he's a lib so he looks good
00:50:00 in comparison to right wingers and bad
00:50:02 in comparison to lefties and like that's
00:50:04 it
00:50:06 So when he's talking to
00:50:08 a MAGA kid or whatever it's like
00:50:10 he got the dunk in
00:50:12 I don't think he's like a terrible person
00:50:14 but it's like
00:50:16 stances in
00:50:18 like no but I would
00:50:20 early on
00:50:22 hate Destiny as a person
00:50:24 because of the way he would interact with people
00:50:28 and that's not a good way to hate someone
00:50:30 you know like you should hate someone
00:50:32 having
00:50:34 disagreements but like being able to
00:50:36 have fun with them anyway because they're
00:50:38 kind of he's alright
00:50:40 when he's a human being
00:50:42 he's not like the worst person ever
00:50:44 like I've flipped flopped on
00:50:46 the extent to which
00:50:48 I hate a person
00:50:50 like Destiny and like you know what
00:50:52 ultimately he's just a guy
00:50:54 I shouldn't get too worked up about
00:50:56 Destiny this or that
00:50:58 Exactly
00:51:00 I just I reached a point
00:51:02 I reached a point where I had
00:51:04 heard enough I had heard enough
00:51:06 fucking debates on the internet
00:51:08 I know everything already
00:51:10 I unsubbed from all the debates
00:51:12 I blocked all the recommendations for them on my
00:51:14 YouTube and literally the next day
00:51:16 I felt better because I didn't see
00:51:18 bad ideas anymore
00:51:20 I was like oh my god
00:51:22 this is a great idea
00:51:24 all the time people spend
00:51:26 listening to debate bros on twitch
00:51:28 would be better spent
00:51:30 investing in bitcoin
00:51:32 doesn't take that long to do that
00:51:34 you should take the more
00:51:36 time you spend investing in bitcoin
00:51:38 the better your results will be
00:51:40 I promise
00:51:42 I just I just see instead of seeing
00:51:44 Destiny and Vosh stream recommendations
00:51:46 on my YouTube I just see like
00:51:48 every episode of best of the worst now
00:51:50 I'm like ah life is good again
00:51:52 this is great
00:51:54 can you block certain channels on YouTube
00:51:56 yeah you just like click the little dots
00:51:58 on the thumbnail and you go don't recommend
00:52:00 channel and it's like okay
00:52:02 I've never done that
00:52:04 but I might start doing that
00:52:06 it's incredible because every time you see like some
00:52:08 stupid viral video that like somehow got back
00:52:10 in the algorithm you're just like never show me this again
00:52:12 what really bugs me is twitter
00:52:14 twitter has started recommending me
00:52:16 like topics
00:52:18 it didn't use
00:52:20 did you install the better twitter plugin yet?
00:52:22 no I'll do that right now
00:52:24 I'll do that
00:52:26 it keeps recommending me
00:52:28 it tried to get me to follow Elon musk
00:52:30 as a topic the other day and I have never
00:52:32 been so insulted in my entire life
00:52:34 I have never been more disgusted
00:52:36 um
00:52:38 you can tell it to not
00:52:40 recommend you that topic anymore
00:52:42 but it will continue to recommend you other topics
00:52:44 I think the only
00:52:46 the only like weird thing about the better twitter plugin
00:52:48 is that when it blocks stuff
00:52:50 it doesn't like get rid of the space
00:52:52 it's just a gap of like
00:52:54 what would be there and it's just blank
00:52:56 which is kind of weird but it's also good
00:52:58 because it gives you a moment to be like wait a minute
00:53:00 you can appreciate that the software is doing something
00:53:02 what am I doing with my life right now
00:53:04 I'm just like scrolling for the last 15 minutes
00:53:06 and now I'm just there's just nothing there to distract
00:53:08 my brain I realize what I'm doing I'm like
00:53:10 I have better things to do in my life right now
00:53:12 so it's kind of a power move in disguise
00:53:14 yeah
00:53:16 better twitter hide retweets
00:53:18 refresh oh it doesn't even need to refresh
00:53:20 wow there's nothing here
00:53:22 it's all gone
00:53:24 your entire time on it just destroyed
00:53:26 better twitter is
00:53:28 is just nothing
00:53:30 yeah that says a lot
00:53:32 it's a better version yeah
00:53:34 makes you think thought provoking
00:53:36 uh
00:53:38 oof
00:53:40 Gib did you forget about daylight savings time
00:53:42 I didn't forget I was
00:53:44 I was having a wolf I was wolf
00:53:46 pilling my parents
00:53:48 I don't know what the fuck that means
00:53:50 that sounds terrifying
00:53:52 that sounds terrible
00:53:54 you know wolf peck I must have talked about it before
00:53:56 no it's a band
00:53:58 like a funky like
00:54:00 contemporary funky comedy
00:54:02 not comedy but like really good musicians
00:54:04 um and
00:54:06 I don't think you've ever mentioned this before
00:54:08 I've definitely mentioned it but maybe it didn't stick
00:54:10 because it wasn't that interesting at the time
00:54:12 but like wolf pilling
00:54:14 is when you show people
00:54:16 wolf peck live at Madison Square Garden
00:54:18 concert and then they go oh
00:54:20 oh it's so cool
00:54:22 and good and then they love it
00:54:24 that's
00:54:26 that's how I was doing that I was busy
00:54:28 oh I
00:54:30 I clicked over to it and there's a guy
00:54:32 going into
00:54:34 a little saxophone and oh yeah
00:54:36 like okay
00:54:38 oh it is a tiny saxophone
00:54:40 it's him and
00:54:42 he's he's plucking he's plucking a violin
00:54:44 no no it's a mandolin
00:54:46 I think
00:54:48 oh okay
00:54:50 yeah that those are
00:54:52 another guy I'm not sure
00:54:54 what his name is
00:54:56 but I know these guys from from youtube videos
00:54:58 I found them I was looking at music
00:55:00 music's cool
00:55:02 wolf peck is great
00:55:04 they do lots of instrumental and funky
00:55:06 and soulful
00:55:08 stuff that's wholesome and cool
00:55:10 and they're very very very talented
00:55:12 go listen to the wolf peck
00:55:14 it's like wolf peck
00:55:16 but not
00:55:18 oh he's he's really going he's really going
00:55:20 on that mandolin
00:55:22 oh yeah
00:55:24 they're having a battle oh they're
00:55:26 they're battling oh they're riffing
00:55:28 okay
00:55:30 I get it so we put that on the tv
00:55:32 and my parents were like wow
00:55:34 like what years this is
00:55:36 1970 because like
00:55:38 you know music these
00:55:40 days sucks
00:55:42 they couldn't even believe it was 2019
00:55:44 culture death
00:55:46 yeah yeah yeah
00:55:48 I've never
00:55:50 making real music in the year of our lord
00:55:52 2020
00:55:54 it's because it's like
00:55:56 my parents they don't use youtube
00:55:58 and so much new cool music
00:56:00 is on youtube but it's not like on tv
00:56:02 they would never see something like wolf peck ever
00:56:04 but people like me who are hip and trendy
00:56:06 do see it
00:56:08 I'm all in the know on the cool
00:56:10 new bands that are around
00:56:12 like wolf peck and
00:56:14 loose coal and
00:56:16 stuff
00:56:18 damn
00:56:20 you must be popular
00:56:22 no
00:56:26 despite all my music knowledge
00:56:28 despite everything
00:56:30 my existence is meaningless
00:56:34 ah cringe
00:56:36 but also based
00:56:40 what else
00:56:42 before you showed up
00:56:44 we were talking about
00:56:46 all our secret projects and shit
00:56:48 and um
00:56:50 shit like that and not saying anything
00:56:52 because they're too secret to be discussed
00:56:54 yeah it's a great topic for a podcast
00:56:56 super interesting
00:56:58 did you see my little Clarissa animation
00:57:00 I made
00:57:02 it was on twitter
00:57:04 she gets a gun out
00:57:06 she gets a gun out
00:57:08 I just thought that was nice
00:57:10 but if you haven't seen it
00:57:12 I will grab it
00:57:14 I need to learn to animate so bad
00:57:16 oh wait
00:57:18 oh I see it
00:57:20 oh yeah
00:57:22 I wasn't feeling so good over the last week
00:57:24 so I didn't really
00:57:26 manage to do anything
00:57:28 but I just picked up
00:57:30 procreate on ipad has
00:57:32 like a animation assist thing where each layer
00:57:34 becomes like an onion skin for another layer
00:57:36 so I just
00:57:38 did a little thing and I was like yeah it's pretty good
00:57:40 I guess I still have like skill in that area
00:57:42 the follow through on the holster is really good
00:57:44 oh yeah didn't you like study animation
00:57:46 like at school or something
00:57:48 like I got a degree in it like or something
00:57:50 oh my wow
00:57:52 weird
00:57:54 it's almost like I have
00:57:56 should be incredible
00:57:58 but I'm not I'm just sort of alright
00:58:00 hmm
00:58:02 the
00:58:04 it's good
00:58:06 follow through
00:58:08 did she get shot in the head at the end?
00:58:10 yeah she does
00:58:12 damn
00:58:14 I wasn't sure if it was her
00:58:16 shooting her own gun and being like
00:58:18 or okay okay now I know
00:58:20 I have been
00:58:22 I have been I think
00:58:24 I've been more productive this week and the reason
00:58:26 why was because I have
00:58:28 I had a game of Noida
00:58:30 that went really really far
00:58:32 and it took me a long
00:58:34 I spent like a day and a half just like
00:58:36 having the most
00:58:38 the most the furthest game of
00:58:40 Noida I've played and when
00:58:42 when I finally died I was like
00:58:44 I'm sick of this shit
00:58:46 uh no more
00:58:48 and I haven't played Noida since
00:58:50 and it's good
00:58:52 because you could that shit can
00:58:54 eat up your whole day if you let it
00:58:56 that's video games
00:58:58 that's video games
00:59:00 I mean that game
00:59:02 it took me it literally took me like
00:59:04 30 hours and I think I just stayed up
00:59:06 for like 30 hours straight
00:59:08 oh my god
00:59:10 just becoming just becoming a Noida god
00:59:12 uh uh
00:59:14 by the end I had like
00:59:16 I had these like teleporting wands
00:59:18 with like modifiers to make the teleport
00:59:20 spells like have really low duration
00:59:22 so I would just hold down
00:59:24 the button and just like
00:59:26 machine gun out like short
00:59:28 teleport spells that would just make me like
00:59:30 like across the screen like
00:59:32 so I could just like shoot across the
00:59:34 entire world
00:59:36 uh in in in like
00:59:38 a minute but like
00:59:40 because like you can't really control the direction
00:59:42 I you're like spazzing around
00:59:44 the screen you're like up down left
00:59:46 but like generally
00:59:48 sort of making progress in a left word
00:59:50 or right word or upward direction
00:59:52 uh
00:59:54 and uh
00:59:56 just going around and like shooting like
00:59:58 I had a wand that would shoot out like a big
01:00:00 like shotgun spread of black
01:00:02 holes that would just eat like
01:00:04 all the terrain in front of me and I was just
01:00:06 like going through these caverns
01:00:08 just like
01:00:10 just like just annihilating
01:00:12 like literally annihilating all the terrain
01:00:14 in front just like just just just going through
01:00:16 the world just erasing it behind
01:00:18 me it was pretty cool
01:00:20 um but then I touched some polymorphine
01:00:22 and I died uh which is
01:00:24 pretty much the only thing that can kill you
01:00:26 at that point in the game uh and that's
01:00:28 what happened wow sad
01:00:30 sad yeah
01:00:32 boy but I'm
01:00:34 but when I but after after like 30 hours
01:00:36 sunk into it when I died I was kind of like
01:00:38 I'm glad like thank
01:00:40 you I'm free I'm free and I
01:00:42 hate this game now uh
01:00:44 uh for a while anyway
01:00:46 uh my the spell is broken
01:00:48 uh
01:00:50 for how long
01:00:52 all I had to do oh it turns out all I had to do
01:00:54 uh to break my noida addiction
01:00:56 was just indulge
01:00:58 it so hard
01:01:00 that it uh
01:01:02 that uh I don't know
01:01:04 things just fix themselves
01:01:06 for no reason yeah
01:01:08 yeah basically it's like
01:01:10 cigarettes you know
01:01:12 you gotta smoke all these cigarettes now
01:01:14 you gotta smoke the whole
01:01:16 you gotta smoke the whole carton
01:01:18 and then that'll teach you
01:01:20 kid
01:01:22 that's definitely how it works I've saw it on TV
01:01:24 oh
01:01:26 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
01:01:28 I uh I
01:01:30 found this um
01:01:32 well I didn't find it somebody
01:01:34 posted it and I was like oh that sounds like fun
01:01:36 um it's a
01:01:38 geography what is it
01:01:40 online dot satara dot com
01:01:42 it's a it's a guess
01:01:44 we'll find where the country is
01:01:46 on the map every single country
01:01:48 on the earth and click on it
01:01:50 and you get three tries before it just tells you
01:01:52 where it is and if you get it right
01:01:54 immediately it it's like
01:01:56 bright it goes white but if you get
01:01:58 it wrong um it becomes
01:02:00 red and you have to fill in the the entire
01:02:02 world and I played this
01:02:04 and I realized how pathetic
01:02:06 my knowledge of geography of
01:02:08 particularly Africa is
01:02:10 I'm like Africa was just like
01:02:12 you know you don't learn about African
01:02:14 there's so many countries
01:02:16 in Africa and like they're so big
01:02:18 there's no way they're like
01:02:20 the same country they're not
01:02:22 even slightly similar there's so much
01:02:24 you know landmass there
01:02:26 so I went on like a on a
01:02:28 geography learning binge
01:02:30 I went to I went to
01:02:32 just a random like
01:02:34 country in Africa that I got completely wrong
01:02:36 didn't know what it was what the flag was
01:02:38 whatever some of them I thought
01:02:40 were like in South America or like
01:02:42 fucking
01:02:44 Middle East or whatever I'm just I'm done
01:02:46 it was so so embarrassing
01:02:48 and I picked a flag I picked
01:02:50 a flag and then I just
01:02:52 Wikipediaed it and then I just looked
01:02:54 into it and then
01:02:56 I feel like I want to do that for every country
01:02:58 that I got wrong I just want to know the shape of the country
01:03:00 the flag and a little bit about
01:03:02 the culture of it and like the history
01:03:04 yesterday I was looking at
01:03:06 Mali which is
01:03:08 like North
01:03:10 West Africa
01:03:12 and that's like
01:03:14 got a cultural
01:03:16 like story about
01:03:18 like an emperor who
01:03:20 appears to have inspired the Lion King
01:03:22 I'm not sure whether that's true
01:03:24 but he was called the Lion King
01:03:26 he's like the emperor of Mali
01:03:28 of the Mali empire
01:03:30 and he was like you know all that stuff
01:03:32 and that was cool and then I was looking
01:03:34 into like what was the rape of
01:03:36 Africa actually like what happened why did that happen
01:03:38 and I looked into like
01:03:40 how Africa was
01:03:42 divvied up between European nations who were just like
01:03:44 curving up the land to get
01:03:46 resources because of a economic
01:03:48 depression they thought well we'll just
01:03:50 we'll just rape Africa let's do it
01:03:52 and they fought over Africa
01:03:54 why not and they split it up
01:03:56 and that's where some of the weird borders in
01:03:58 Africa that are completely straight lines that's
01:04:00 the Europeans I mean all of it
01:04:02 before before
01:04:04 Africa was like
01:04:06 divvied up into those countries
01:04:08 they had like empires that overlapped each other
01:04:10 there were no like the entirety
01:04:12 of Africa was not
01:04:14 owned by any individual like
01:04:16 country wasn't like split up
01:04:18 which is weird to look at as a map
01:04:20 because it's like there's a big
01:04:22 blob there that is no one's there
01:04:24 apparently there's not even
01:04:26 no borders no government or nothing
01:04:28 just little
01:04:30 smaller blobs that don't even fill the entirety
01:04:32 of the landmass of Africa like what the fuck
01:04:34 I've never seen I've never even considered
01:04:36 that you can have a world where
01:04:38 the borders don't technically like
01:04:40 line up to touching each other
01:04:42 but that's like the ultimate like
01:04:44 if you
01:04:46 if you try to conquer the world and everybody's
01:04:48 got a stake and everybody has a flag and
01:04:50 everybody's fighting eventually all the borders
01:04:52 will touch
01:04:54 it doesn't didn't need to be like
01:04:56 that now this is just interesting I'm just on
01:04:58 a big learning curve learning time
01:05:00 that's why I posted that tweet of me
01:05:02 learning it was so fun
01:05:04 to learn so much I felt so good
01:05:06 about it
01:05:08 I'm on the site
01:05:10 right now
01:05:12 it gave me a bunch of like hard balls
01:05:14 right off the bat
01:05:16 there's so many countries in the world
01:05:18 what the fuck is San Marino
01:05:20 yeah it includes like tiny
01:05:22 islands that are technically their own nations
01:05:24 as well like groups of islands as well
01:05:26 so like
01:05:28 Lichtenstein
01:05:30 Lichtenstein is in the middle of Europe
01:05:32 I think
01:05:34 it is it's between
01:05:36 I thought Luxembourg was Lichtenstein
01:05:38 I think it's between
01:05:40 Switzerland and is that Hungary
01:05:42 oh god
01:05:44 oh god I thought I knew
01:05:46 I thought I knew everything
01:05:48 okay Latvia I know where Latvia is
01:05:50 Netherlands I know where Netherlands is
01:05:52 Luxembourg
01:05:54 it's one of these cities
01:05:56 it's this tiny little thing yeah yeah next to
01:05:58 something okay I'm
01:06:00 I'm a fucking genius
01:06:02 so I wanted to
01:06:04 I would encourage everyone
01:06:06 to go to this link and play this game
01:06:08 see what you know about the world
01:06:10 because it's fun just like
01:06:12 having some reason to look into
01:06:14 something because there's so much information out there
01:06:16 and
01:06:18 learning is fun I didn't know that
01:06:20 yeah you hear
01:06:22 about learning
01:06:24 fucking Bulgaria
01:06:26 Hungary
01:06:28 Slovenia
01:06:30 these aren't real
01:06:32 they're in the Eurovision Song Contest
01:06:34 and we always lose
01:06:36 UK always loses the Eurovision Song Contest
01:06:38 because they hate us
01:06:40 what the fuck is that
01:06:42 what the fuck is that
01:06:44 it's a
01:06:46 a song contest that is
01:06:48 it's like the Olympics
01:06:50 but for singing and in Europe
01:06:52 it includes Russia and Australia
01:06:54 so it's like
01:06:56 Europe's got talent
01:06:58 I guess Russia is Europe
01:07:00 it just like stretches all the way to
01:07:02 other parts of the world
01:07:04 Russia's so big
01:07:06 Cyprus
01:07:08 yeah Cyprus
01:07:10 oh it's a tiny little
01:07:12 why is Cyprus
01:07:14 considered Europe
01:07:16 it's like south of fucking Turkey
01:07:18 yeah Turkey's in the Eurovision Song Contest
01:07:20 as well
01:07:22 I guess Turkey is considered
01:07:24 part of
01:07:26 the Middle East slash Northern Africa
01:07:28 why is Turkey
01:07:30 not part of Europe
01:07:32 but Cyprus is that's insane
01:07:34 the only ones in Africa
01:07:36 I remember getting was Egypt
01:07:38 South Africa the Central African Republic
01:07:40 for obvious reasons because they just
01:07:42 tell you where they are
01:07:44 and then like Algeria
01:07:46 and the rest I didn't know
01:07:48 what the fuck is Andorra

01:07:58 because it's funny
01:08:00 okay it's between France

01:09:48 here wait I'll post
01:09:50 Eleazar
01:09:52 put my map
01:09:54 put my map
01:09:56 in the episode so they can see
01:09:58 so they can see how good I did
01:10:00 at geography
01:10:02 is that just your that's more
01:10:04 yeah just your okay yeah
01:10:06 you can do like um yeah
01:10:08 the North America South America
01:10:10 different areas I did the like the entire world
01:10:12 thing and I got like yeah
01:10:14 I don't know 13%
01:10:16 the first time I was like oh god
01:10:18 embarrassing
01:10:20 I'm sure I would do
01:10:22 I would probably be pretty good with South
01:10:24 America
01:10:26 I would I mean
01:10:28 yeah the Middle East and Africa
01:10:30 I would probably struggle with and like Southern Asia
01:10:32 I have two fucking knows
01:10:34 who fucking knows about all these
01:10:36 I just have one big country like America
01:10:38 you know
01:10:40 why not just make one big
01:10:42 big old big old country
01:10:44 that's bigger and that's better
01:10:46 in my opinion
01:10:48 your ideas have merit but I don't like
01:10:50 the cut of your gym so you're gonna die
01:10:52 now
01:10:54 solid
01:10:58 to follow
01:11:00 what the fuck to follow
01:11:02 to follow oh I actually got it in the third
01:11:04 such a place
01:11:06 it's an island in Africa
01:11:08 no it's an island near
01:11:10 fucking Indonesia
01:11:12 I see
01:11:14 Vietnam I know that
01:11:16 I actually
01:11:18 don't know where
01:11:20 Vietnam is exactly or like what it looks
01:11:22 like
01:11:24 it's just the low channel and it's on the coast
01:11:26 oh okay
01:11:28 that makes sense
01:11:30 um
01:11:32 alright
01:11:34 um yeah anyway
01:11:36 let's move on from
01:11:38 where is the country
01:11:40 thank you all for learning with us today
01:11:42 yeah yeah thank you all type in the comments
01:11:44 how much you've learned go learn something
01:11:46 and then come back and say I learned this
01:11:48 this is an educational podcast
01:11:50 here before someone said I learned Ben's
01:11:52 bad with Bitcoin
01:11:54 no no no no you're gonna you laugh
01:11:56 now but the dip is coming the dip
01:11:58 is coming well here's here's the thing
01:12:00 if you do one thing and I do the opposite at least
01:12:02 one of us might get rich
01:12:04 hmm that's a good idea for a podcast
01:12:06 you guys just always do the opposite of everything
01:12:08 each episode someone's always
01:12:10 right and you call it the always right podcast
01:12:12 if you
01:12:14 always right
01:12:16 somebody yeah one person
01:12:18 that'd be so bad like one person buys
01:12:20 tons of Bitcoin the other one
01:12:22 wait doesn't sells it doesn't buy
01:12:24 it doesn't
01:12:26 buy something else
01:12:28 it's like one of us made the better investment
01:12:30 one of us was right
01:12:32 Christ you can either buy
01:12:34 or not and if you don't
01:12:36 and it goes up you feel
01:12:38 sad
01:12:40 wait okay well they would be like okay
01:12:42 one person invests like
01:12:44 I don't know maybe a thousand dollars
01:12:46 into Bitcoin and the other
01:12:48 person just has a pot of like a thousand
01:12:50 dollars USD
01:12:52 and then
01:12:54 yeah yeah you just you start with
01:12:56 a pot that you pay that you
01:12:58 set aside for yourself and then
01:13:00 once one
01:13:02 sells when the other buys and and vice yeah
01:13:04 you could do it it would be great
01:13:06 uh
01:13:08 the PCP the only podcast where we
01:13:10 have ideas for better podcasts
01:13:12 on our show one ends up rich
01:13:14 and the other ends up poor and then
01:13:16 the rich one buys the poor one
01:13:18 into servitude and then
01:13:20 let's play channel
01:13:22 and then and then well
01:13:24 and then they get a new guy in to be the
01:13:26 new other guy
01:13:28 he's got to buy in his own pot and then
01:13:30 the goal and you know whoever wins
01:13:32 that contest buys the other
01:13:34 two and it's just like a rolling ball
01:13:36 and like each time
01:13:38 a new person ends up owning all the other
01:13:40 ones until they become
01:13:42 a multinational corporation yeah
01:13:44 and then and they start a let's play channel
01:13:46 and then they start a they start
01:13:48 a service they start like a like a video
01:13:50 streaming service like Polaris or something
01:13:52 or a network
01:13:54 some shady some shady fucking pyramid
01:13:56 scheme yeah the pc pyramid
01:13:58 scheme the pc pyramid scheme
01:14:00 that's right that's right
01:14:02 ah
01:14:04 um how
01:14:06 how far are we in we're an hour
01:14:08 and should we start voicemails
01:14:12 I don't mind
01:14:14 uh I don't know
01:14:16 if I have anything you just you just got here
01:14:18 I just go yeah I don't I don't have
01:14:20 that much to talk about either oh yeah
01:14:22 there are yeah I'm floundering
01:14:24 fucking gorillas you ever heard of
01:14:26 gorillas the band
01:14:28 oh I thought you meant
01:14:30 the apes
01:14:32 the primates no no these are
01:14:34 two dimensional
01:14:36 they're these big
01:14:38 man
01:14:40 beasts
01:14:42 they're pretty crazy
01:14:44 oh favorite primates favorite primates
01:14:46 say
01:14:48 um
01:14:50 favorite primates
01:14:52 yeah
01:14:54 there's so many to choose from
01:14:56 gonna have to go with human
01:14:58 probably something like a
01:15:00 maybe like maybe like a lemur
01:15:02 is a lemur a primate yeah yeah
01:15:04 monkeys and apes and all that
01:15:06 lemurs are pretty cool
01:15:08 lemurs are yeah I like lemurs
01:15:10 because I think monkeys
01:15:12 and apes in general are pretty ugly
01:15:14 but lemurs like just look like a
01:15:16 they're sort of like a cute like
01:15:18 cat looking thing so I think they're like
01:15:20 less off-putting yeah they're sort of almost
01:15:22 squarely
01:15:24 yeah and they're in the Madagascar
01:15:26 film
01:15:28 I don't I don't like monkeys
01:15:30 they're they're kind of gross actually
01:15:32 they are yeah okay
01:15:34 all right I got that one candy valley thing going on
01:15:36 you know they do
01:15:38 they do
01:15:40 predictably um my favorite is the gibbon
01:15:42 mmm
01:15:44 I didn't see the text on this game
01:15:48 yeah that's me
01:15:50 Mikey going to get his gun
01:15:52 just
01:15:54 the way they hold their hands up
01:15:56 he's pretty good
01:15:58 such long arms like whoa
01:16:00 I gotta put them somewhere otherwise they'll drag on the ground
01:16:02 do they not have tails
01:16:04 no gibbons are like
01:16:06 they're like teddy bears
01:16:08 that's pretty good
01:16:10 he's got his fucking like ice climbers face
01:16:12 yeah he's got like a
01:16:14 like a built-in parka
01:16:16 built-in
01:16:18 just reminds me of all the way
01:16:20 back in the day on the furry
01:16:22 episode of the pzp
01:16:24 where one of you guys said that my persona
01:16:26 was an orangutan and I've never forgotten
01:16:28 I think that was me
01:16:30 I think it was you actually
01:16:32 because you're lanky
01:16:34 I know to this day I'm just like oh no
01:16:36 this is why I can't ever go outside
01:16:38 no one wants to see the orangutan
01:16:40 in the store
01:16:42 I'm sorry
01:16:44 orangutans
01:16:46 I promise it's not because
01:16:48 you're as hideous as an orangutan
01:16:50 I'm pretty close though
01:16:52 look at these guys
01:16:54 they love each other
01:16:56 incredible
01:16:58 I need to find my orangutan gf I guess
01:17:00 oh these guys
01:17:02 God look at them
01:17:04 ew
01:17:06 this is what you see when you see me
01:17:08 I thought they were bigger
01:17:10 they're so short
01:17:12 there are probably like different types
01:17:14 I think the kind of orangutan that have the
01:17:16 weird like flesh
01:17:18 like side head
01:17:20 things
01:17:24 maybe I wasn't thinking of an orangutan
01:17:26 what is king louie in jungle book
01:17:28 what kind of monkey is he with the really long arms
01:17:30 is he an orangutan
01:17:32 he's just an idealized disney orangutan
01:17:34 and not the real nightmares
01:17:36 we have to share the earth with
01:17:38 why do some of them look like this
01:17:40 what is that going on there
01:17:42 that is incredible
01:17:44 I feel like it might be an alpha male thing
01:17:46 like the alpha male grows those on the side of its head
01:17:48 and then everyone else is just normal
01:17:50 is that really what happens
01:17:52 like a lion's mane or something
01:17:54 maybe some different types
01:17:56 I'm gonna go learn some stuff
01:17:58 hashtag learning
01:18:00 this is just a learn podcast now
01:18:02 look at things the viewers can't see
01:18:04 and talk about them
01:18:06 the name orangutan means
01:18:08 man of the forest in the Malay language
01:18:10 man of the forest
01:18:12 in what language? in Malay
01:18:14 Malaysia
01:18:16 flanged male bornians
01:18:18 Sumatran and Tapanuli
01:18:20 okay so some orangutans
01:18:22 are called flanged
01:18:24 which means they have the flange
01:18:26 okay okay
01:18:28 the flange look at this
01:18:30 this guy
01:18:32 these are the same type
01:18:34 adult male
01:18:36 and female Tapanuli orangutans
01:18:38 so I think it is a male female thing
01:18:40 that orangutan has a sick beard
01:18:42 I'm gonna give him that
01:18:44 pretty powerful
01:18:46 hmm
01:18:48 you know I'm turning around on this
01:18:50 I wonder if this is where ginshers came from
01:18:52 hmm
01:18:54 oh wait a minute look at this
01:18:56 okay these ones
01:18:58 are flanged in an unflanged male here
01:19:00 oh it's like
01:19:02 circumcision
01:19:04 some of them have their flanges cut off
01:19:06 and then they lose sensation
01:19:08 oh no
01:19:10 are you just saying that
01:19:12 where are you reading this
01:19:14 no yes some orangutans
01:19:16 they do facial circumcision
01:19:18 it's like a
01:19:20 they've learned how to use tools but only for that
01:19:22 yeah some
01:19:24 orangutans are the original
01:19:26 Hebrew rabbis that invented the practice
01:19:28 actually
01:19:30 oh
01:19:32 that's where it comes from
01:19:34 we're learning a lot today
01:19:36 and
01:19:38 yeah I can't
01:19:40 I can't really make out a clear rhyme or reason
01:19:42 to like which
01:19:44 ones of them are fucked up in the face
01:19:46 they're not fucked up
01:19:48 they're just big
01:19:50 I mean compared to the other face that's an improvement
01:19:52 let's be real
01:19:54 we have mumps
01:19:56 a little bit
01:19:58 control f
01:20:00 flanged
01:20:02 control f
01:20:04 okay
01:20:06 adult males may develop distinctive cheek
01:20:08 pads or flanges
01:20:10 younger males do not and resemble
01:20:12 okay so
01:20:14 I don't think it's all types of orangutans
01:20:16 males get the flanges
01:20:18 but only the males get it
01:20:20 and like in some
01:20:22 strains of the
01:20:24 that is bizarre
01:20:26 I wonder what the evolutionary advantage of that
01:20:28 is that cause it to stick
01:20:30 okay okay they may exhibit
01:20:32 males become sexually mature
01:20:34 around age 15 they may exhibit
01:20:36 arrested development by not developing
01:20:38 the distinctive cheek pads pronounced throat
01:20:40 pouches long fur or long
01:20:42 calls I don't know what a call is
01:20:44 until a resident
01:20:46 dominant male is absent
01:20:48 the transformation from unflanged
01:20:50 can occur quickly
01:20:52 flanged males attract females in estrus
01:20:54 with their characteristic long calls
01:20:56 which may also suppress development in younger males
01:20:58 what the fuck
01:21:00 are you fucking kidding me
01:21:02 that doesn't sound real
01:21:04 what you're what this is saying
01:21:06 is that in a fucking orangutan tribe
01:21:10 one like the fucking patriarch
01:21:12 orangutan has a flanged face
01:21:14 and all the other males are just like
01:21:16 they go unflanged and then if that like
01:21:18 top flanged guy
01:21:20 dies then like one of the other guys
01:21:22 is like I'm the new daddy
01:21:24 now and then his face will
01:21:26 fucking transform
01:21:28 and then you giant rat
01:21:30 how
01:21:32 becomes the new giant rat
01:21:34 how that's like that's like if humans
01:21:36 like there was just like one muscular
01:21:38 guy and if he died someone randomly
01:21:40 in your town just became muscular
01:21:42 wait look at this this is insane
01:21:44 listen to this
01:21:46 unflanged males
01:21:48 wander widely in search of estrus females
01:21:50 and oh my god
01:21:52 and upon finding one will force
01:21:54 copulation on her
01:21:56 the occurrence of which is unusually high among mammals
01:21:58 females prefer to mate
01:22:00 with the fitter flanged males
01:22:02 and seek their company for protection
01:22:04 non ovulating males do not usually
01:22:06 non ovulating females do not
01:22:08 usually resist copulation with unflanged males
01:22:10 as the chance of conception is low
01:22:12 resident males may form
01:22:14 consort ships that last for days
01:22:16 weeks or months after copulation
01:22:18 homosexual behavior has been recorded
01:22:20 in the context of both affiliative and
01:22:22 aggressive interactions
01:22:24 holy shit
01:22:26 so is this like we officially
01:22:28 learned too much on this podcast now
01:22:30 if you don't have the flange
01:22:32 then you're basically
01:22:34 an incel orangutan
01:22:36 yes it's literally
01:22:38 virgins and chads it's real
01:22:40 it's just biology guys
01:22:42 that's what we've learned today
01:22:44 guys if you're a chad put like flanged
01:22:46 in your bio
01:22:48 if you're flanged
01:22:50 if you're flanged all the
01:22:52 fucking bitches
01:22:54 want your dick and if you
01:22:56 if you're unflanged you fucking form
01:22:58 a fucking roving rape gang
01:23:00 or you have to kill the flanged
01:23:02 you gotta kill him so you can
01:23:04 become the new flanged
01:23:06 I wonder if
01:23:08 that happens I wonder if
01:23:10 because I know in like silverback
01:23:12 in silverback tribes
01:23:14 like the younger males
01:23:16 will like challenge the silverback
01:23:18 for like dominance
01:23:20 I wonder if that happens in orangutans
01:23:22 is it weird that nature
01:23:24 literally puts a target on the face of the
01:23:26 alphas of orangutans
01:23:28 like it just leads your fist
01:23:30 leads your fist directly
01:23:32 well that's why there's such chads
01:23:34 because like they
01:23:36 you know the only way to be the coolest
01:23:38 is to be
01:23:40 susceptible to like
01:23:42 assassination
01:23:44 that's like the power move
01:23:46 his chad hitbox is twice as big
01:23:48 flanged grow
01:23:50 what the fuck
01:23:52 I'm trying to find
01:23:54 Ben you said you played so much noida
01:23:56 you just couldn't stand anymore
01:23:58 we're overdosing on learning right now
01:24:00 to the point where I don't want to learn anymore
01:24:02 no we could always learn more there's always more to learn
01:24:04 okay I'm reading about
01:24:06 their social life
01:24:08 adult males are dominant over sub adult males
01:24:10 yeah okay
01:24:16 orangutans will form traveling groups
01:24:18 between different food sources
01:24:20 consort ships
01:24:22 between an adult male and a female
01:24:24 social grooming
01:24:26 is uncommon among orangutans
01:24:28 well that's good
01:24:30 this knowledge makes the plan of the eight movies
01:24:32 so much more scary
01:24:34 they might just be like serial rapists
01:24:36 but at least they don't groom
01:24:38 each other
01:24:42 you wouldn't find them on a discord
01:24:44 okay it seems like
01:24:46 maybe they don't
01:24:48 really form like big
01:24:50 tribes so maybe it's not
01:24:52 like one
01:24:54 flanged male
01:24:56 like sort of dominates
01:24:58 the gorillas have like the one silverback kind of like dominates everything
01:25:00 I think orangutans
01:25:02 like more live on their own
01:25:04 so maybe it's not so much that like the
01:25:06 they start out in a jungle by them
01:25:08 they build their house
01:25:10 and
01:25:12 they kill creepers
01:25:14 all man
01:25:16 they go to the nether
01:25:18 and they play minecraft
01:25:20 they play some minecraft and monkeys
01:25:22 orangutans play minecraft
01:25:24 orangutans disperse
01:25:26 and establish their home ranges by age 11
01:25:28 females tend to settle close to their mothers
01:25:30 while males disperse much farther
01:25:32 but may include their natal birth range
01:25:34 within their new home range
01:25:36 they enter a transient phase
01:25:38 which lasts until a male
01:25:40 which lasts until a male can challenge
01:25:42 and displace a dominant resident male from his home range
01:25:44 both resident and transient orangutans
01:25:46 aggregate on large fruiting trees
01:25:48 the fruit
01:25:50 yeah okay
01:25:52 so they have like individual little areas
01:25:54 and then a village where they all eat fruit
01:25:56 they all kind of
01:25:58 individual zones that are theirs
01:26:00 but they all sort of like
01:26:02 they all sort of consort with one another
01:26:04 in like a wider range
01:26:06 are you saying they all get on jungle twitter
01:26:08 and fight each other just like we do
01:26:10 they all
01:26:12 yeah which is way cooler
01:26:14 as god intended
01:26:16 exactly
01:26:18 I don't know so what do we think
01:26:20 has this made us more or less inclined
01:26:22 to return to monk
01:26:24 it's a real mixed bag I think
01:26:26 yeah it's
01:26:28 their strengths and weaknesses
01:26:30 I like
01:26:32 relatively low levels of testosterone
01:26:34 interesting
01:26:36 I like that they just kind of like
01:26:38 they hit
01:26:40 they hit like adolescence
01:26:42 and then they're like well I'm out
01:26:44 and they just go and like find a little like
01:26:46 tree clearing and like this is my now
01:26:48 but like they still kind of like
01:26:50 hang out
01:26:52 with like you know
01:26:54 orangutans around and they have like neighbors
01:26:56 and like oh hey
01:26:58 can I borrow a cup of sugar
01:27:00 it's the equivalent of having
01:27:02 full diamond full enchanted
01:27:04 diamond armor
01:27:08 all this learning about
01:27:10 orangutan society really makes that first
01:27:12 gift with the heart wipe kind of insidious
01:27:14 oh yeah that he's an
01:27:16 unflanged
01:27:18 god he's manipulating her
01:27:20 yeah
01:27:22 orangutans communicate with various sounds
01:27:24 males will make long calls
01:27:26 to attract okay by call they mean like
01:27:28 an actual like they're yelling
01:27:30 what else would they be
01:27:32 get on like an hour long phone call
01:27:34 I don't know I thought maybe it was like a term
01:27:36 for some part of their anatomy
01:27:38 that like humans don't have
01:27:40 like a waddle or so
01:27:42 I don't know maybe
01:27:44 males will make long calls but they'll attract females
01:27:46 and to advertise themselves to other males
01:27:48 what
01:27:50 just to let them know like hey guys don't
01:27:52 don't fuck around I'm here
01:27:54 these are divided into three parts
01:27:56 they begin with grumbles climax
01:27:58 with pulses and end with bubbles
01:28:00 what did you say
01:28:02 I said the call
01:28:04 begins with grumbles
01:28:06 climaxes with pulses
01:28:08 and ends with bubbles
01:28:10 both sexes will try to intimidate
01:28:12 conspecifics
01:28:14 cons intimidate
01:28:16 conspecifics
01:28:18 with a series of low guttural noises known collectively
01:28:20 as the rolling call
01:28:22 when annoyed an orangutan will suck in air
01:28:24 through purse lips making a kissing sound
01:28:26 known as the kiss squeak
01:28:28 mothers reproduce
01:28:30 mothers produce throat scrapes to keep in contact
01:28:32 with their offspring
01:28:34 what
01:28:36 they
01:28:38 my son you haven't
01:28:40 you haven't answered my throat scrapes in months
01:28:42 what are you doing
01:28:44 are you eating well
01:28:46 infants make soft hoots when distressed
01:28:48 orangutans are also known to produce
01:28:50 smacks or blow raspberries
01:28:52 when making a nest
01:28:54 okay
01:28:56 so they just make a bunch of weird
01:28:58 a bunch of weird
01:29:00 sounds all the time
01:29:02 they're fucking kissing noise
01:29:04 they just sound like freaks
01:29:06 that's gross
01:29:08 they are freaks
01:29:10 they're demons
01:29:12 they're deem forest demons
01:29:14 they don't want to return to monkey anymore
01:29:16 so tom that's you basically that's you
01:29:18 by the way
01:29:20 I've just become more and more subtly insulted
01:29:22 by ben's comment from five years ago
01:29:24 I read this and I
01:29:26 uninformed by all this information
01:29:28 I read this and I think Tommy Oliver
01:29:30 yeah you know
01:29:32 what can I say
01:29:34 he's been known to
01:29:36 produce smacks or blow raspberries
01:29:38 when making a nest
01:29:40 you know I mean
01:29:42 yeah
01:29:44 he caught me
01:29:46 he's been known to begin with grumbles
01:29:48 climax with pulses and end with bubbles
01:29:50 hasn't everybody at least once
01:29:52 just me
01:29:54 it's relatable
01:29:56 it's like
01:29:58 orangutan relatable comics
01:30:00 is like oh that feel when
01:30:02 that feel when your mother
01:30:04 is throat scraping at you
01:30:06 oh god
01:30:08 I'm trying to
01:30:10 I'm trying to force copulation mom
01:30:12 I'm not flanged yet already
01:30:14 oh are you flanged yet honey
01:30:16 no mom
01:30:18 I'm working on it
01:30:20 I'm finding a dominant male to challenge
01:30:22 god
01:30:24 this is fucked up
01:30:26 this is too fucked up
01:30:28 ehhh
01:30:30 learning
01:30:34 voicemails
01:30:36 yeah save me
01:30:38 ok
01:30:40 wait voicemails might be even worse shit
01:30:42 yeah it just so happens
01:30:44 that all the voicemails are about orangutans
01:30:46 and there's a complete coincidence
01:30:50 never ends
01:30:52 do you have them open are we ready to go
01:30:54 oh yeah yeah yeah
01:30:56 you gotta look at it
01:30:58 you gotta look at the voicemails
01:31:00 there's more than one page
01:31:02 yeah let's
01:31:04 let's keep a brisk pace up on these
01:31:06 please
01:31:08 alright the first one
01:31:10 is munchie crab rave
01:31:12 are we seeing this
01:31:14 are we seeing this
01:31:16 ok 3 2 1
01:31:18 go
01:31:20 I had just finished chucking a bang energy
01:31:22 it was a new flavor
01:31:24 power punch it tasted like the sweetest
01:31:26 syrup you could imagine
01:31:28 I thought I'd take a look
01:31:30 at munchie's channel
01:31:32 we live some old memories
01:31:34 we watch an episode of arm retrieval
01:31:36 only to see
01:31:38 it's all privatized
01:31:40 lost to time
01:31:42 like slime
01:31:44 like permanent rain
01:31:46 like pseudointellectual vlogs
01:31:48 magenta filters on them
01:31:50 I'm not asking for an apology
01:31:52 I'm not asking for forgiveness
01:31:54 I just want an explanation
01:31:58 that you're
01:32:00 you're talking about munchie's channel
01:32:02 I don't know
01:32:04 anything about that
01:32:06 we're not in charge of it unfortunately
01:32:08 in fact I didn't even know the whole channel was privatized
01:32:10 I didn't know that arm retrieval was
01:32:12 privatized I didn't know that
01:32:14 I learned that
01:32:16 but
01:32:18 Ethan's channel does have
01:32:20 a cool
01:32:22 thing from it
01:32:24 you can find that
01:32:26 munchie just didn't want
01:32:28 his stuff online anymore
01:32:30 that's as much of an explanation
01:32:32 as we can give
01:32:34 yeah that's
01:32:36 pretty much all he said to any of us about it
01:32:40 it is what it is
01:32:44 yeah
01:32:46 I think munchie's experiencing what we all were
01:32:48 happy we didn't
01:32:50 because we were like seven years older
01:32:52 of our entire teenage life being on the internet
01:32:54 for everyone to see
01:32:56 just hurts
01:32:58 just hurts
01:33:02 I guess that's true
01:33:04 yeah
01:33:06 I would probably not like to see
01:33:08 some of the posts that I made
01:33:10 on like accounts that I had
01:33:12 when I was like
01:33:14 16
01:33:16 yeah
01:33:18 oh well
01:33:22 it's his content
01:33:24 it's his content to do
01:33:26 what he likes with at the end of the day
01:33:28 yeah
01:33:30 okay next one is called
01:33:32 misbendering
01:33:34 not a huge deal I just
01:33:36 want to talk
01:33:38 okay three two one
01:33:40 go
01:33:42 so I think Ben was kind of
01:33:44 dismissive on the podcast last week
01:33:46 when he was like
01:33:48 he misgendered this person on
01:33:50 Twitter and they
01:33:52 were like hey my pronouns are in my bio
01:33:54 I didn't read your bio because
01:33:56 if you called them she
01:33:58 that's because
01:34:00 based on either the way they look or their actions
01:34:02 or something you assume
01:34:04 they were female I guess
01:34:06 and it's like a fucking
01:34:08 it's a fucking meme to be like
01:34:10 did you just assume my gender
01:34:12 it's nothing but
01:34:14 if you do assume someone's gender
01:34:16 because of the way they look or the way they're acting
01:34:18 and they're like
01:34:20 that's not correct
01:34:22 you know that
01:34:24 can be upsetting to people if
01:34:26 they think
01:34:28 they're being perceived as this other
01:34:30 gender and demonstrably
01:34:32 they were because of
01:34:34 the way you referred to them and I don't know
01:34:36 in cases like that I think
01:34:38 you do have to have some kind of
01:34:40 compassion for other people
01:34:42 I think you should probably
01:34:44 apologize in situations like that
01:34:46 to give a sincere apology I would have to
01:34:48 feel remorse
01:34:50 why would I feel remorse for a simple
01:34:52 honest mistake
01:34:54 I wouldn't so
01:34:56 there we go did I make a mistake yes
01:34:58 do I feel bad about it no
01:35:00 not really
01:35:02 sure
01:35:04 there was no malicious intent
01:35:06 sure there was no malicious intent
01:35:08 but like
01:35:10 I think the issue is the response
01:35:12 when you make a mistake of
01:35:14 something
01:35:16 it's fine to have made the mistake
01:35:18 so long as you say oh sorry
01:35:20 just any indication that you
01:35:22 I acknowledge
01:35:24 that I did make a mistake
01:35:26 I acknowledge that
01:35:28 I just think it's like
01:35:30 I don't know
01:35:32 good polite
01:35:34 to say it
01:35:36 I didn't want to be polite to this person
01:35:38 I know but like
01:35:40 cringe though
01:35:42 little cringe
01:35:44 I don't
01:35:46 just don't think so
01:35:48 I think it's pretty
01:35:50 value neutral you had one
01:35:52 tweet worth of context for this
01:35:54 person and based on that
01:35:56 tweet which was completely gender neutral
01:35:58 and the profile picture which seemed to be
01:36:00 if I recall like it was pink it was pink
01:36:02 it was like some character right it was
01:36:04 some sort of it was pink and it was a
01:36:06 pink character and also they
01:36:08 had not not that this makes
01:36:10 it any less of a mistake because it was
01:36:12 but like they did the reason why I assumed
01:36:14 is because they had a pink
01:36:16 avatar and they had
01:36:18 they had like the two female
01:36:20 symbols like interlocking
01:36:22 in their bio
01:36:24 like the I guess it's the lesbian symbol
01:36:26 or something two female things
01:36:28 like linked so you know
01:36:30 this is why I assumed it wasn't a
01:36:32 it wasn't a Ronius assumption it's a fair
01:36:34 assumption to make there was a
01:36:36 mistake made I think
01:36:38 people's problem with this interaction
01:36:40 why we're still talking about it three weeks later
01:36:42 is because your response seemed
01:36:44 dismissive and not
01:36:46 like
01:36:48 actively
01:36:50 apologizing
01:36:52 I think the thing is this person was not
01:36:54 but the thing is that the person who was
01:36:56 accusing you wasn't trying to be like
01:36:58 oh by the way you're mistaken
01:37:00 it was like you just
01:37:02 basically
01:37:04 did a hate crime feel bad about it
01:37:06 and like when you're putting the back foot like that
01:37:08 it's like fuck that
01:37:10 it's not even that
01:37:12 it's not even that it's that
01:37:14 I just
01:37:16 I think an apology
01:37:20 an apology
01:37:22 you give an apology when
01:37:24 you feel bad about
01:37:26 something you did and you want
01:37:28 I mean there's there's a there's a there's like
01:37:30 a sincere reason
01:37:32 and you can do it because you have
01:37:34 realized that you were in the wrong
01:37:36 and you want to express
01:37:38 that you have changed
01:37:40 right or you can give an
01:37:42 apology because you want to
01:37:44 reconcile with someone
01:37:46 and you want to let them know
01:37:48 that you are sorry so that they will forgive you
01:37:50 and
01:37:52 one I don't feel any remorse
01:37:54 for making
01:37:56 a simple honest error
01:37:58 I do I I don't feel bad about
01:38:00 that and I hate
01:38:02 this person and I don't care
01:38:04 if they forgive me
01:38:06 therefore what is the what would be
01:38:08 the justification
01:38:10 for making an apology I can't think of one
01:38:12 I can't
01:38:14 I can acknowledge the error
01:38:16 which I did my response did acknowledge
01:38:18 that I was in error I feel like that
01:38:20 is all that is called for
01:38:22 I disagree but I can't
01:38:24 I don't know how I would frame my
01:38:26 I don't know how to say it
01:38:28 I think the problem is optics
01:38:30 just I mean I don't I really don't
01:38:32 care but just because we have the class
01:38:34 I really don't care either it's an optics issue
01:38:36 because you already had people making assumptions
01:38:38 negative assumptions about you during this
01:38:40 discussion that you were like some crazy right
01:38:42 ring person
01:38:44 and by not like immediately
01:38:46 capitulating to like
01:38:48 the gender question to just reinforce those
01:38:50 assumptions where if you would like
01:38:52 actually made a response like oh I'm sorry
01:38:54 I didn't mean that like it probably would put everybody
01:38:56 who had made these assumptions like
01:38:58 challenge those assumptions and made them
01:39:00 slightly reconsider even for a second
01:39:02 day apologizing would have done
01:39:04 wouldn't have done anything in the grand scheme of
01:39:06 things but like in this micro
01:39:08 exchange that for some reason were all
01:39:10 really focused on
01:39:12 it probably would have been a better move
01:39:14 from optics perspective
01:39:16 to be more
01:39:18 transparently apologetic
01:39:20 well I mean if if
01:39:22 by that you mean that
01:39:24 I would not be receiving
01:39:26 voicemails saying um you should have apologized
01:39:28 then yeah apologizing
01:39:30 would have prevented that one thing I
01:39:32 would would say is like
01:39:34 the
01:39:36 disagreement you had with this person was based on
01:39:38 the other thing you said not that you
01:39:40 um
01:39:42 you know misgendered them that was just an extra aside
01:39:44 um I think
01:39:46 it's
01:39:48 to
01:39:50 to you know stay true
01:39:52 to you know yourself and say well
01:39:54 I don't feel remorse so why would I need to apologize
01:39:56 I don't want them to forgive me
01:39:58 it's
01:40:00 nah I can't
01:40:02 I can't think of the right way to say this
01:40:04 I'm gonna I'm going to like make
01:40:06 the wrong point and then you're gonna get the
01:40:08 right idea I need to like write it down
01:40:10 but like it's very subtle
01:40:12 God
01:40:14 I'm stupid I hate being stupid I hate not being
01:40:16 able to quick wittedly
01:40:18 think of an entire argument
01:40:20 out of nowhere
01:40:22 I feel I feel I feel pretty
01:40:24 rock solid on this I feel like
01:40:26 based on based on what an
01:40:28 apology is and what function it serves
01:40:30 one was not necessary in this
01:40:32 situation
01:40:34 by definition I have
01:40:36 I've laid it down
01:40:38 I'm lodged
01:40:40 my logical brain
01:40:42 has uh
01:40:44 it's cracked the case
01:40:46 I'm so fucking angry
01:40:48 with myself I can't figure out how to say this

01:41:22 talking about like oh mind sweeper you

01:41:36 what it is the vast majority of the time you are
01:41:38 very far back exactly where the bombs are
01:41:40 it's very far by we very specific
01:41:42 scenarios where it's just impossible
01:41:44 to figure it out exactly and you can
01:41:46 write an algorithm to prevent those scenarios
01:41:48 from happening when you generate
01:41:50 a map and that's what no guessing mode is
01:41:52 oh my fucking okay I tell you these things

01:42:48 donate to the patreon
01:42:50 and watch that but also
01:42:52 the no guessing mode I've tried it
01:42:54 um I don't like it
01:42:56 there's something annoying about
01:42:58 the first one like I haven't tried it
01:43:00 you go to no guessing mode you click
01:43:02 is like an X this is the first
01:43:04 thing you click and you actually
01:43:06 cannot click anything else you have to click
01:43:08 this space so often it opens up
01:43:10 like a three by three
01:43:12 space and from there it's like
01:43:14 oh god I don't know how to figure
01:43:16 myself out of this one
01:43:18 it's so it's so small I like
01:43:20 the freedom of being able to click randomly
01:43:22 and get lucky to get like a bigger
01:43:24 start or to go to all four corners
01:43:26 so that when I get to those places
01:43:28 you know the likelihood
01:43:30 that I have to guess
01:43:32 at the very end is minimal
01:43:34 I can do
01:43:36 expert mind sweeper now quite easily
01:43:38 and it's fun
01:43:40 and
01:43:42 you don't mind the
01:43:44 the fact that sometimes you have to guess
01:43:46 the no guessing mode is just worse an experience
01:43:48 because even though you don't have to guess
01:43:50 uh it's less
01:43:52 I don't know it's less fast paced
01:43:54 I have to start really slow all the time
01:43:56 I like going to the corners first
01:43:58 it's just good it's just easy
01:44:02 uh based
01:44:04 uh based though
01:44:06 what
01:44:08 yes
01:44:10 next voicemail is called

01:46:22 uwu I just

01:46:40 three two one go
01:46:42 I am extremely
01:46:44 sorry I
01:46:46 forgot to do
01:46:48 something very important last week
01:46:50 I know what it is
01:46:52 which was to remind ben to please catch up on one piece
01:46:54 ben this is your weekly reminder to catch up on one piece
01:46:56 thank you bye
01:46:58 it's so hard though
01:47:00 reading is just so hard
01:47:02 but you've kicked your noida addiction
01:47:04 now you have time
01:47:06 should you spend 30 hours straight
01:47:08 catching up on one piece this week
01:47:10 instead of 30 hours playing a noida run
01:47:12 I'm on a kick though
01:47:14 I'm on a really good kick of getting worked on
01:47:16 on my secret project
01:47:18 I'm gonna try and stick that out
01:47:20 I'm gonna try and ride that
01:47:22 ben you are a pro-crastinator
01:47:24 you cannot be working right now
01:47:26 Drew I have
01:47:28 defied my nature
01:47:30 I have temporarily put it aside
01:47:32 I think
01:47:34 it's gonna be
01:47:36 one piece though
01:47:38 I'll get around
01:47:40 to it
01:47:42 imagine the feeling of slaying this person
01:47:44 for actually
01:47:46 not giving him the ability to continue sending
01:47:48 these voicemails
01:47:52 he just wants
01:47:54 for me
01:47:56 next voicemail is called
01:47:58 FYI
01:48:00 3, 2, 1, go
01:48:02 Konnichiwa
01:48:04 this is Samurai-sama
01:48:06 so
01:48:08 Samurai-sama
01:48:10 notice some confusion
01:48:12 in the right
01:48:14 of this
01:48:16 Samurai-sama want to make
01:48:18 something clear
01:48:20 Samurai-sama
01:48:22 is a man
01:48:24 ok?
01:48:26 Samurai-sama character
01:48:28 he
01:48:30 Kasady-chan
01:48:32 he
01:48:34 ok?
01:48:36 until next time
01:48:38 fuck off you
01:48:40 ben no sentosa
01:48:42 sayonara
01:48:44 samurai sensei
01:48:46 that's like a zetsubo sensei
01:48:48 but different
01:48:50 did we make that mistake
01:48:52 did we
01:48:54 I don't remember
01:48:56 I don't think so
01:48:58 I know that Kasady is a she
01:49:00 and Samurai is a he
01:49:02 because Samurai is a character
01:49:04 by which I mean he's a real person
01:49:06 who dogs me
01:49:08 in real life
01:49:10 I guess I might have made
01:49:12 I might have made that mistake
01:49:14 because when I think about it
01:49:16 I'm not sure how to
01:49:18 with the
01:49:20 using pronouns to refer to a character
01:49:22 played by a trans person
01:49:24 who is the other gender of the character
01:49:26 there are no pronouns
01:49:28 there are no pronouns or just
01:49:30 what even is a pronoun really
01:49:32 when you get right down to it
01:49:34 what really is a pronoun really
01:49:36 when you get down to it
01:49:38 what even is
01:49:40 a
01:49:42 pronoun crastinators
01:49:44 the pronoun crastinators
01:49:46 there it is we did it
01:49:48 we got there
01:49:50 the pronoun
01:49:52 okay whatever next voicemail
01:49:54 is called radcon4
01:49:56 over one year later
01:49:58 three two one go
01:50:00 there was some confusion on this
01:50:02 Ben and co the day that
01:50:04 we recorded that thing about
01:50:06 radcon4 was the
01:50:08 anniversary of it
01:50:10 yeah we're over a year lads
01:50:12 I knew that
01:50:14 that was the whole point I thought
01:50:16 or I knew
01:50:18 it was around I didn't know
01:50:20 whether it was the exact one year anniversary
01:50:22 but yeah this is the
01:50:24 the pronoun
01:50:26 cast
01:50:28 yes the pronoun cast
01:50:30 about radcon
01:50:32 that's what they're talking about
01:50:34 next one is called victimless crime
01:50:36 in quotes three
01:50:38 two one go
01:50:40 this is a message to
01:50:42 younger or more impressionable listeners
01:50:44 of the podcast who don't know better
01:50:46 and this is coming on the show before but
01:50:48 don't shoplift
01:50:50 don't fucking do it it's a joke
01:50:52 don't shoplift
01:50:54 if you do it you're gonna get caught
01:50:56 and you're gonna get fucked really bad
01:50:58 if you do get caught
01:51:00 it's gonna happen the people in this podcast
01:51:02 are fools
01:51:04 they're naive idiots they don't know what they're talking about
01:51:06 it's a joke don't actually
01:51:08 shoplift don't be stupid
01:51:10 alright
01:51:12 I mean definitely don't
01:51:14 getting caught would be really bad
01:51:16 so definitely don't get caught
01:51:18 if you get caught shoplifting
01:51:20 you have done it wrong
01:51:22 and you have done it you have fucked up
01:51:24 I don't condone getting caught
01:51:26 shoplifting
01:51:28 yeah I mean I would never do it
01:51:30 because I am scared of consequences
01:51:32 and I would assume
01:51:34 it would fail
01:51:36 like it's not a thing
01:51:38 I would have pulled victimless crime
01:51:40 I think
01:51:42 the implication here is that the victim
01:51:44 is the person who will get caught
01:51:46 and get in trouble which is true
01:51:48 that is probably the main victim
01:51:50 of shoplifting
01:51:52 the real crime is getting close
01:51:54 yeah
01:51:56 the real crime is punishing someone
01:51:58 for stealing from a faceless corporation
01:52:00 I would feel super bad
01:52:02 if I was like shoplifting is morally
01:52:04 neutral
01:52:06 well I will do it then
01:52:08 and then they did it
01:52:10 and then they got caught and there were
01:52:12 terrible legal consequences for them
01:52:14 that would just be awful and terrible
01:52:16 and not worth it at all
01:52:18 I would say that podcast told me
01:52:20 to do it and their mom gets all pissed
01:52:22 I knew podcasts were the work
01:52:24 of the devil
01:52:26 I don't know how young
01:52:28 and impressionable our audience is
01:52:30 I feel like most of them
01:52:32 are like
01:52:34 super young
01:52:36 they wouldn't all be late teens and up
01:52:38 obviously
01:52:40 don't shoplift
01:52:42 if it's
01:52:44 difficult
01:52:46 just
01:52:48 I think what we've said in the past is
01:52:50 what we've said in the past is that
01:52:52 shoplifting from a large corporation
01:52:54 is not a morally wrong thing
01:52:56 to do it's just a shame
01:52:58 that you can get caught for it and that sucks
01:53:00 I wouldn't condone it
01:53:02 myself I know Ben might
01:53:04 because Ben's like more into it
01:53:06 than I am
01:53:08 I would say that it's morally neutral
01:53:10 it's neither good nor bad
01:53:12 well yeah
01:53:14 I would just
01:53:16 I've never been caught
01:53:18 shoplifting so
01:53:20 I don't even know
01:53:22 what would happen
01:53:24 it probably depends a lot
01:53:26 on who catches you
01:53:28 and what store you're at
01:53:30 and whatever
01:53:32 so I don't even know what the consequence
01:53:34 would be
01:53:36 I feel like in certain stores shoplifting would be so much easier
01:53:38 now because everybody has to wear masks
01:53:40 so they can't identify you and a lot of stores can't chase
01:53:42 after you so what are they going to do
01:53:44 some kind of mask came and stole our shit
01:53:46 most stores can't chase after you
01:53:48 the only one who can
01:53:50 arrest you for it is if there's
01:53:52 a plainclothes police officer on the scene
01:53:54 the store cannot
01:53:56 apprehend you
01:53:58 and hold you against your will
01:54:00 or like tackle you or like that's completely illegal
01:54:02 they basically have
01:54:04 the store itself has like
01:54:06 no I don't know they might hire
01:54:08 someone who is like a
01:54:10 I think there are certain credentials
01:54:12 some people can have that do like allow
01:54:14 them to do that on behalf of like law enforcement
01:54:16 but like
01:54:18 a store employee can't a normal store employee can't
01:54:20 like
01:54:22 seize you and stop you from leaving the grounds
01:54:24 and like punish you or whatever
01:54:26 they simply don't have the authority
01:54:30 so I would say if you do get caught
01:54:32 shopping probably the thing to do
01:54:34 is try and lie your way out of it
01:54:36 and if it doesn't work just run
01:54:38 and like
01:54:40 almost in most cases
01:54:42 they will simply have no recourse
01:54:46 again I have never had to do that
01:54:48 so I don't really know and I guess I'm talking
01:54:50 out my ass
01:54:52 getting in trouble with the law is scary
01:54:54 because it's the law
01:54:56 so for that reason I wouldn't
01:54:58 suggest trying it
01:55:00 yeah
01:55:02 yeah
01:55:04 the potential consequences are usually not
01:55:06 worth a couple of dollars you might save
01:55:08 on something getting a rap sheet in the first place
01:55:10 getting a criminal record is super bad
01:55:12 and definitely not worth anything
01:55:14 you can shoplift
01:55:16 I think if you're the sort of person
01:55:18 who is able to listen to the procrastinators
01:55:20 podcast
01:55:22 then you're probably not
01:55:24 in a position where you need
01:55:26 to shoplift
01:55:28 really probably okay
01:55:30 what do you mean by that
01:55:32 well you have access to the internet
01:55:34 you have
01:55:36 time to listen to such a stupid
01:55:38 podcast
01:55:40 this is like you're doing
01:55:42 the same bit that that streamer
01:55:44 did that girl who said like
01:55:46 if you have time to watch my stream
01:55:48 you have time
01:55:50 to donate to me to donate 5 bucks
01:55:52 to subscribe
01:55:54 instead of that I'm saying you probably don't need to
01:55:56 risk a criminal record
01:55:58 I'm not saying donate to the podcast
01:56:00 I think it's a better message
01:56:02 I'm saying that
01:56:04 I would say
01:56:06 I would suggest
01:56:08 that anyone listening go out
01:56:10 and shoplift right now and then donate
01:56:12 whatever they saved
01:56:14 to the patreon
01:56:16 is my
01:56:18 I don't know
01:56:20 I mean
01:56:22 I'm sure there are people
01:56:24 listening right now who are in economic
01:56:26 distress
01:56:28 I'm listening and I'm in economic distress
01:56:30 that'll be true
01:56:32 for a lot of people
01:56:34 but I mean those people still
01:56:36 it would be probably
01:56:38 it wouldn't help
01:56:40 them to get fucking arrested
01:56:42 like the amount of
01:56:44 money saved
01:56:46 sometimes proportional to the
01:56:48 largeness of the thing you're stealing
01:56:50 like if you try and steal a fridge
01:56:52 that's gonna be a little difficult
01:56:54 if you try and get the steal like a candy bar
01:56:56 you can probably put it in your pocket
01:56:58 steal small
01:57:00 things that have a high price
01:57:02 per ounce
01:57:04 like fucking diamond jewelry
01:57:06 yes for example
01:57:08 things like cheese
01:57:10 things like cheese are like
01:57:12 pretty high
01:57:14 in a grocery store
01:57:16 I would say cheese is small
01:57:18 high in calories and relatively high
01:57:20 costs per weight so it makes a good thing
01:57:22 that you can just slip into your pocket
01:57:24 and pretend you didn't realize you had
01:57:26 or something like
01:57:28 like steve
01:57:30 or something like
01:57:32 vanilla extract
01:57:34 or a tiny little bottle of vanilla extract
01:57:36 might cost like 12 bucks
01:57:38 but you just pop it in my pocket
01:57:40 and it's like well I just won't pay that
01:57:42 for instance I mean I'm just
01:57:44 thinking off the top of my cup here
01:57:46 not like I would know or anything
01:57:48 not like I thought about it
01:57:50 all these examples sound like things that you would
01:57:52 probably eat on the daily
01:57:54 they're so specific
01:57:56 they're so stevia's keto
01:57:58 no it's not
01:58:00 cheese and stevia both keto how interesting
01:58:02 hmm
01:58:04 like I said I haven't been going to stores
01:58:06 I just order my groceries now
01:58:08 but if I did I don't know
01:58:10 probably wouldn't be worth the risk at this point
01:58:12 um yeah don't do it
01:58:14 I guess that's my
01:58:16 probably don't do it
01:58:18 probably don't do it but if you do
01:58:20 I won't think you're a bad person
01:58:22 but it's probably not worth it most of the time
01:58:24 okay there we go
01:58:26 next voicemail
01:58:28 is bring back tectonic improvements
01:58:30 and gamers tavern

01:59:06 um
01:59:08 I know tectonic was with cheesy that one time
01:59:10 no I don't
01:59:12 I think tectonic was on
01:59:14 twice
01:59:16 the one tectonic was on
01:59:18 first
01:59:20 gamers tavern might have also been on that one
01:59:22 I don't know
01:59:24 yeah I remember but yeah
01:59:26 those guys are cool
01:59:28 we could have one of them back
01:59:30 recently I haven't had
01:59:32 guests in a while
01:59:34 shocking realization
01:59:36 three two one go
01:59:38 guys I think the nape fuckers
01:59:40 are gay
01:59:42 like they just sound really gay
01:59:44 no
01:59:46 I don't know it could just be me but like
01:59:48 I just get like gay vibes from them
01:59:50 that sounds
01:59:52 very silly
01:59:54 that's ridiculous listen to yourself you sound
01:59:56 you're insane you're crazy
01:59:58 you don't know what's happening yeah don't you realize
02:00:00 they're all female
02:00:02 right
02:00:06 gay
02:00:08 what a concept
02:00:14 next voicemail is called mark
02:00:16 24 three two one
02:00:18 go so if you guys haven't already
02:00:20 you should totally check out the game ever hood
02:00:22 it's like psychedelic undertale with
02:00:24 guitar hero bullet hell battles that's
02:00:26 fucking sick
02:00:28 is that the dug tenable
02:00:30 no no it's ever heard
02:00:32 yeah I thought he said that but ever hood
02:00:34 is another thing okay what's the dug
02:00:36 tenable one never heard
02:00:38 well done ever heard never yeah
02:00:42 this looks like a rhythm
02:00:44 game it's good I see the under
02:00:46 I see the undertale reference
02:00:48 reference
02:00:50 is this a video game reference
02:00:52 oh it is
02:00:54 looks kind of neat this looks kind of cool
02:00:56 I've heard the fuck about it as well
02:01:00 wait I'm gonna do like a
02:01:02 something I'm gonna do a thumbnail
02:01:04 show me a
02:01:06 yeah this is flowery see
02:01:08 that's flowery that's flowery right there
02:01:12 honestly yeah this is a little
02:01:14 to undertale actually
02:01:16 it's unapologetically undertale
02:01:18 this is it almost
02:01:20 seems like the amount
02:01:22 to which this is referencing
02:01:24 undertale is like part of the joke
02:01:26 or something
02:01:28 I just think it's a marketing strategy
02:01:30 I think it's a marketing strategy maybe
02:01:32 I mean people are talking about it so it
02:01:34 clearly worked it's like undertale
02:01:36 with guitar hero with guns
02:01:38 it's like even the font for the game
02:01:40 it's like hey it's the undertale font
02:01:42 basically but we just it looks exactly like
02:01:44 undertale of yeah
02:01:46 which is fine they even have I guess undertale
02:01:48 is like a they do have someone looks just
02:01:50 like Gino the art for this guy
02:01:52 is Gino it's that's Gino
02:01:54 it's ridiculous our boy
02:01:56 okay pretty good
02:01:58 all right
02:02:00 is undertale like
02:02:02 has it become sort of a
02:02:04 sort of genre like a pseudo
02:02:06 genre no undertale likes
02:02:08 are those a thing
02:02:10 I was that's what I'm thinking are they I mean
02:02:12 they are this one clearly
02:02:14 I feel like in a way
02:02:16 yes but then it's more that the
02:02:18 undertale and like Lisa
02:02:20 and earthbound are all part of the same
02:02:22 earthbound are
02:02:24 G genre earthbound like
02:02:26 would be
02:02:28 weirdo weirdo RPG
02:02:30 yeah I it's probably
02:02:32 that like that genre
02:02:34 of weirdo RPG
02:02:36 is the is the group
02:02:38 but then like undertale is such a like
02:02:40 influential
02:02:42 piece of it that it has
02:02:44 like it's its own influence
02:02:46 I say that it's had a lot
02:02:48 of influence on other like
02:02:50 subsequent games in the
02:02:52 name I got a name so for
02:02:54 earthbound likes that are undertale
02:02:56 adjacent we call them
02:02:58 other tale
02:03:00 mmm that's good
02:03:02 I dig it that's that's cute
02:03:04 that's cute
02:03:06 this game looks kind of this game looks
02:03:08 kind of neat though would you sacrifice
02:03:10 your humanity to receive
02:03:12 immortality yes
02:03:14 everhood trailer yes of course I would
02:03:16 in a heartbeat answer
02:03:18 100% defy humanity
02:03:20 you I mean part of you part of
02:03:22 being human is to be mortal so like you
02:03:24 just necessarily give up
02:03:26 now that see the thing they
02:03:28 they say they don't tell you is that the
02:03:30 part of humanity they take is
02:03:32 your IQ
02:03:34 they take all of your IQ
02:03:36 oh no
02:03:38 no I'll just
02:03:40 become flanchless orangutans living
02:03:42 forever cursed to wander looking for
02:03:44 they take your flanges away but you can live
02:03:46 forever
02:03:48 who would want to live without flanges
02:03:50 this is
02:03:52 this is the plot of my new other tale
02:03:54 game that's coming out that I'm working
02:03:56 on is it's going to be like
02:03:58 you start you're a humble
02:04:00 little rice farmer
02:04:02 until one day
02:04:04 a fucking a fucking goblin
02:04:06 goblin shows up
02:04:08 a goblin appears
02:04:10 and he steals all your equals
02:04:12 your rice he's skilled no he steals
02:04:14 all your IQ points and he scatters
02:04:16 all 100 of your IQ
02:04:18 points to the far corners of the
02:04:20 earth and you have to go get
02:04:22 them
02:04:28 how do you even get the first one
02:04:30 here that's the toughest
02:04:32 one that's the toughest one
02:04:34 you gotta that would be a funny idea
02:04:36 the game gets easier as you go instead of harder
02:04:38 yeah the first thing is the most difficult
02:04:40 part of the game the final boss
02:04:42 is like learning how to walk again
02:04:44 like the
02:04:46 the first one is maybe like
02:04:48 you just like gotta like mash
02:04:50 one button
02:04:52 just pound a button like a thousand times
02:04:54 and that's the only thing you can do and eventually
02:04:56 the game's 50 hours long but the first
02:04:58 point back and now you can move
02:05:00 jabbing one button over and over again to get your first IQ
02:05:02 point that's like right in front of you
02:05:04 then there's just two hours of the rest
02:05:06 of the game
02:05:08 that mischievous goblin though
02:05:10 the IQ goblin he's just like
02:05:12 haha I've got the points
02:05:14 I will send them away
02:05:16 he's very
02:05:18 sinister
02:05:20 next voicemail is called
02:05:22 the entire thing
02:05:24 three two one go
02:05:42 I've had was the
02:05:44 voicemail kind of wish
02:05:46 the pcp
02:05:48 fellas would do a super best
02:05:50 friends and just make a video
02:05:52 telling everyone they
02:05:54 don't enjoy slash
02:05:56 they can't work with each other
02:05:58 anymore instead of trying
02:06:00 to drag this podcast
02:06:02 along off
02:06:04 legacy alone watch
02:06:06 as I ingest this entire
02:06:08 cock
02:06:10 hey yeah
02:06:12 hey yeah
02:06:14 was that a cookie I sounded like a comment
02:06:16 that may have been posted I haven't
02:06:18 read yet it might be
02:06:20 it sounds it sounds like
02:06:22 sort of an amalgam of all
02:06:24 the of all the sorts of
02:06:26 comments that say like
02:06:28 I used to I used to
02:06:30 like the podcast more the podcast
02:06:32 should just die
02:06:34 or whatever I think the
02:06:36 obvious thing missing from this analysis
02:06:38 is that we still
02:06:40 can work together just fine
02:06:42 we're still here the podcast
02:06:44 you're listening to we're here doing it
02:06:46 we're doing it right now we're making
02:06:48 it happen we're proving all the haters wrong
02:06:50 does anybody has anybody have
02:06:52 any dissolutions at this point that Nate and
02:06:54 Trixie and munchie don't
02:06:56 like being on the podcast
02:06:58 is that still unclear
02:07:00 what I feel like
02:07:02 a year of doing this should make it pretty obvious
02:07:04 what is the pcp
02:07:06 if not a podcast
02:07:08 persevering after all
02:07:10 the person ever less
02:07:12 podcast
02:07:14 nevertheless we persisted
02:07:16 mmm
02:07:18 uh this guy
02:07:20 this guy is a fucking bitch
02:07:22 and I hope he enjoys that cock
02:07:24 okay
02:07:26 same
02:07:28 yeah next one
02:07:30 is called bringing it back
02:07:32 three two one go
02:07:34 at work today a man
02:07:36 tried to circumcise himself
02:07:38 he didn't finish the job
02:07:40 it's really alarming
02:07:42 agreed
02:07:44 that sucks
02:07:46 well
02:07:48 why would you do it to yourself
02:07:50 get a professional
02:07:52 well you can um
02:07:54 you might uh it might be
02:07:56 you know you can always
02:07:58 it's good though
02:08:00 it's good to go to your genitals with a knife
02:08:02 I mean what's the harm
02:08:04 because I mean at least
02:08:06 at least it hurts
02:08:08 he didn't do enough circumcision
02:08:10 right but that's okay because you can always circumcise
02:08:12 more
02:08:14 the real danger is doing too much circumcision
02:08:16 because you can't
02:08:18 reduce the amount to which
02:08:20 you were circumcised later
02:08:22 so I would I would advise that if you
02:08:24 want to be circumcised
02:08:26 do it in little pieces
02:08:28 just do it like cut like just slice off
02:08:30 a piece of your foreskin
02:08:34 and then come back with a knife
02:08:36 and chop up the next like the next millimeter
02:08:38 of it and then just
02:08:40 every time the last one heals
02:08:42 why would it make a sound
02:08:44 that's the sound of the butcher knife
02:08:46 hitting the hitting the
02:08:48 what you call it the chopping block
02:08:50 the cutting board
02:08:52 chopping cock
02:08:54 chopping cock you might say
02:08:56 um little baby steps
02:08:58 baby steps
02:09:00 baby 12 steps to the perfect
02:09:02 circumcised cock
02:09:04 my new novel
02:09:06 book
02:09:08 self-help book
02:09:10 available on amazon
02:09:12 I wish
02:09:14 next
02:09:16 next voicemail is called
02:09:18 animorphine time
02:09:20 3, 2, 1, go
02:09:22 Ben why aren't you in the
02:09:24 animorphine time podcast
02:09:26 uh discord yet
02:09:28 there's a discord
02:09:30 I guess like I guess like I didn't know there was a discord
02:09:32 I guess I could join the I haven't listened to it
02:09:34 in a couple weeks
02:09:36 uh
02:09:38 I could I I bet if I asked they would let me
02:09:40 be a guest on there maybe I don't know
02:09:42 they had
02:09:44 one they had
02:09:46 they had a guest
02:09:48 or a pair of guests
02:09:50 that were really annoying most of the time
02:09:52 they're fine but there was one episode
02:09:54 animorphine time that had two guests
02:09:56 who I just couldn't stand
02:09:58 they were it was a married couple
02:10:00 and
02:10:02 the wife
02:10:04 just kept shrieking
02:10:06 every time her husband
02:10:08 said anything the husband was very much
02:10:10 like very dry since if humor
02:10:12 deadpan delivery and every time
02:10:14 he said anything like
02:10:16 I wouldn't say darker edgy
02:10:18 but he would he would be like sarcastic right
02:10:20 every time he said anything sarcastic
02:10:22 the wife would just start shrieking
02:10:24 I hated her
02:10:26 I hated them so much
02:10:28 so my goal would be to be better
02:10:30 than them
02:10:32 I feel like you'd be like hey can I talk about
02:10:34 animorphine you guys on a podcast
02:10:36 we did this whole big video about it
02:10:38 there was some sexism
02:10:40 and edgy jokes in that video
02:10:42 sorry you're cancelled
02:10:44 they would um
02:10:46 you know I saw
02:10:48 I was randomly recommended a video
02:10:50 from a youtube channel
02:10:52 that was talking about animorphs
02:10:54 and he sort of offhandedly
02:10:56 mentioned your lecture and put up like a thumbnail
02:10:58 it wasn't a huge channel
02:11:00 or anything it was um
02:11:02 I think it was recommended
02:11:04 to me after watching a James Tullos
02:11:06 video someone else was just
02:11:08 talking about
02:11:10 someone else did like an animorph some
02:11:12 like series
02:11:14 retrospective you know
02:11:16 one of those
02:11:18 um animorphine time is pretty funny
02:11:20 uh I don't know
02:11:22 I don't know if they
02:11:24 follow me on twitter but like I don't know if they
02:11:26 know who I am or what the pcp is
02:11:28 or anything
02:11:30 but whatever
02:11:32 ok
02:11:34 next voicemail is called

02:13:24 make a save state then you click
02:13:26 the square and if you blow up
02:13:28 we'll then just load your save state
02:13:30 and pick another square and just keep doing that until you win
02:13:32 and that's how you
02:13:34 solve Picross forever
02:13:36 I'm a genius
02:13:38 that's so much smarter than you Gib
02:13:40 uh
02:13:42 I can't believe I've been
02:13:44 bested so easily
02:13:46 you're all like oh well you can
02:13:48 logically deduce that to this square
02:13:50 and this square no
02:13:52 detective shit
02:13:54 waste of fucking time
02:13:56 I'm here doing detective work and that guy's
02:13:58 going in guns blazing and getting the job done
02:14:00 instantly with no problem
02:14:02 you're playing LA Noir and he's
02:14:04 playing Grand Theft Auto
02:14:06 yeah
02:14:08 if you yes
02:14:10 uh
02:14:12 next one is called Easy Money
02:14:14 3 2 1 go
02:14:16 ayo can this dick
02:14:18 fit in your mouth
02:14:20 hmm
02:14:22 I don't know I didn't know how big it is
02:14:24 it was an audio show
02:14:26 most dicks probably
02:14:28 could
02:14:30 just geometrically speaking
02:14:32 next one is called Hi Ben
02:14:34 3 2 1 go
02:14:36 I
02:14:38 am going
02:14:40 to fuck
02:14:42 the best guy
02:14:44 ever because
02:14:46 his butthole
02:14:48 is supple
02:14:50 just like his brother
02:14:52 wait
02:14:54 oh the fucking modulator
02:14:56 okay
02:14:58 next one is called Hi Ben 2
02:15:00 let's try this again
02:15:02 3 2 1 go
02:15:20 that was way better
02:15:22 the modulation just added so much
02:15:24 sound quality
02:15:26 and the dog squeaking as well
02:15:28 the squealing
02:15:30 the squealing mammal
02:15:34 don't incentivize those kinds of things
02:15:36 did you hear that shit Tom
02:15:38 oh oh yes
02:15:40 oh yes
02:15:42 the next one is called The End
02:15:44 and its own reward
02:15:46 and okay the email attached is called
02:15:48 an end to cluster punk at
02:15:50 sad.time so
02:15:52 I'm prepared to cry
02:15:54 3 2 1 go
02:16:22 could enjoying the process
02:16:24 be its own reward
02:16:28 I think yes
02:16:30 yes
02:16:32 yes
02:16:34 I think
02:16:36 I think this is
02:16:38 the end
02:16:40 of the bear
02:16:42 suck
02:16:44 if you want to call it that
02:16:48 how far we've come
02:16:50 to an end
02:16:52 in so short a time
02:16:54 in fact the only things that are good
02:16:56 are things that stop immediately
02:16:58 and they never come back
02:17:00 I wonder what he's going to do next
02:17:02 just like
02:17:04 my wand
02:17:06 just like my teleport wand in Noida
02:17:08 that shot the really short teleport bolts really fast
02:17:10 that made me go
02:17:12 you get an end really fast
02:17:14 and that makes it good
02:17:16 next voicemail is called
02:17:18 bacon bacon surprise
02:17:20 3 2 1 go
02:17:48 why
02:17:50 he's 10 feet wide
02:17:52 and armed to the teeth
02:17:54 cut this big bacon
02:17:56 bastard
02:17:58 best to the bear and me
02:18:00 okay I was wrong
02:18:02 it's not over
02:18:04 it's just totally wrong
02:18:06 that was only the beginning
02:18:08 so the bacon man
02:18:10 is that what
02:18:12 it's a bacon man
02:18:14 is it like a redditor is that what they mean
02:18:16 I think the bear
02:18:18 has the edge
02:18:20 being a carnivore
02:18:22 wait bears eat meat right
02:18:24 I mean I know they eat honey
02:18:26 they eat fish out of the river
02:18:28 and they'll kill humans
02:18:30 sometimes
02:18:32 bears eat anything they don't fuck around
02:18:34 okay
02:18:36 even spaghetti
02:18:38 even spaghetti but not macaroni
02:18:40 cause they've never heard of such a thing
02:18:42 I know that feel
02:18:44 next voicemail is called
02:18:46 the monopoly man
02:18:48 who remember promised
02:18:50 was it 2,000 doge coin
02:18:52 to whoever made the best
02:18:54 league of nate fuckers video

02:19:14 will not only get 2,000 doge coin
02:19:16 but also the rights to nate's body
02:19:18 the league will entrust him
02:19:20 with his health
02:19:22 and thirst
02:19:24 ho ho ho
02:19:26 this was the monopoly man
02:19:28 good luck everybody
02:19:32 such a long pause
02:19:34 I thought it was over
02:19:36 it's like he had to check his script
02:19:38 to see that
02:19:40 he had to turn the page
02:19:42 ho ho ho
02:19:44 well I guess the stakes
02:19:46 have been raised
02:19:48 next voicemail
02:19:50 is called
02:19:52 btorish from
02:19:54 umineko
02:19:56 3 2 1 go

02:20:26 what is this
02:20:28 I know
02:20:30 I've heard of it
02:20:32 I think it's a manga
02:20:34 it's a japanese dojin
02:20:36 soft visual novel series
02:20:38 okay
02:20:40 it's what the
02:20:42 it's what Beatrice is from
02:20:44 it's what that name is from
02:20:46 but where's the game oh wait it's a
02:20:48 yeah yeah visual novel video game I think
02:20:54 I like that being on a we
02:20:56 microphone that was good
02:21:00 yeah I
02:21:02 think this caller might be
02:21:04 disappointed because I don't know
02:21:06 anything about it
02:21:08 lol
02:21:16 uh guys
02:21:18 I thought there's
02:21:20 why did everyone shut up
02:21:22 yeah I thought there was a problem with the call
02:21:24 I was like everyone's one saying anything
02:21:26 what the fuck okay well I guess
02:21:28 next I guess next voicemail
02:21:30 I thought that awkward's pause out
02:21:32 no no no no
02:21:34 there was another one too there was another
02:21:36 long awkward pause before
02:21:38 keep it all in
02:21:40 it's all part of the experience
02:21:42 you know who cuts their awkward pauses out
02:21:44 the pizza party podcast they do
02:21:46 we can't stoop to that level
02:21:48 it's dishonest frankly it's despicable
02:21:54 say in the comments if you
02:21:56 watch only for the awkward pauses
02:21:58 I need
02:22:00 my I appreciate naturalism
02:22:02 naturalism in my podcasts
02:22:04 I need to feel
02:22:06 the pain
02:22:08 the pain that the podcasters
02:22:10 are experiencing
02:22:12 uh the next voicemail
02:22:14 is called ben taint
02:22:16 three two one go
02:22:20 did you know come is keto
02:22:22 yep well for me
02:22:24 that's not good enough
02:22:26 I must have Nate's come
02:22:28 so I may enter the most
02:22:30 true ketosis
02:22:32 with Nate's come
02:22:34 I can make the best
02:22:36 keto gummies
02:22:38 all out of commies
02:22:40 but there's still
02:22:42 one problem
02:22:44 I don't have Nate's come yet
02:22:46 to get it
02:22:48 I'll have to join the league
02:22:50 of Nate fuckers
02:22:52 they're
02:22:54 they're still working on
02:22:56 getting it
02:22:58 I think the bureaucracy
02:23:00 the administration of the league
02:23:02 is too much red tape
02:23:04 they can't get anything done
02:23:06 they all have
02:23:08 different ideas
02:23:10 of how best to fuck Nate
02:23:12 they can't vote on anything
02:23:14 if they all came at the same time
02:23:16 but if they all came to Nate
02:23:18 at the same time Nate doesn't have that many holes
02:23:20 it's not even gonna work
02:23:22 it would be
02:23:24 all the dicks
02:23:26 they would just clog
02:23:28 they would just bump against each other
02:23:30 it would be like
02:23:32 the thing with mr burns
02:23:34 and the diseases
02:23:36 and the germs too many germs
02:23:38 that they can't get all squeezed through the door
02:23:40 so there's so many
02:23:42 Nate fuckers that Nate is completely
02:23:44 protected
02:23:46 complete virgin
02:23:48 they just can't fuck
02:23:50 they can't fuck
02:23:52 I wonder if Michelle is in the league
02:23:54 who do you think started it
02:23:56 I don't know
02:23:58 the league seems to want to cuck Michelle
02:24:00 but I mean they could
02:24:02 she's like the shadow
02:24:04 there's like a hooded figure
02:24:06 Michelle's part of the Nate Chastity brigade
02:24:08 there's a hooded
02:24:10 maybe there's a hooded figure
02:24:12 who appears only in hologram form
02:24:14 who leads the league of Nate fuckers
02:24:16 secretly Michelle under the hood
02:24:18 I don't know
02:24:20 we'll never know
02:24:22 this really is a tales gets trolled
02:24:24 so I gotta go now
02:24:26 so many faces
02:24:28 do you ever wonder what it's like for that one person
02:24:30 every week who's not subscribed
02:24:32 who just stumbles upon an episode
02:24:34 and gets to this portion
02:24:36 what the fuck is wrong with these people
02:24:38 I have
02:24:40 nothing but disdain
02:24:42 for anyone who isn't subscribed already
02:24:44 every episode is someone's first episode
02:24:46 I seek to pun it
02:24:48 I don't know if that's true
02:24:50 I'm not sure if
02:24:52 maybe
02:24:54 no
02:24:56 no no every episode is someone's last episode
02:24:58 that's what that's the actual
02:25:00 that's definitely true
02:25:02 the turnover rate
02:25:04 is just astronomical
02:25:06 next voicemail is called
02:25:08 Phrygian Meetup
02:25:10 3 2 1
02:25:12 3 2 1
02:25:14 go
02:25:16 so when are we getting the files from the meetup
02:25:18 it's been a year
02:25:20 maybe you could just dump them somewhere
02:25:22 I don't know
02:25:24 on that subject though
02:25:26 being some of the guys from the meetup are getting back together
02:25:28 and having our own radcon next week
02:25:30 so PCP fans
02:25:32 we'll have some new lectures for you soon

02:25:46 I am praying for you
02:25:48 yes
02:25:50 cool
02:25:52 people do lectures
02:25:54 people doing their own lectures is cool
02:25:56 I like it
02:25:58 we should find
02:26:00 the meetup footage
02:26:02 I need to talk to Victor somehow
02:26:04 Trixie has it right
02:26:06 she was the one who was collecting all the footage
02:26:08 at the end of the day
02:26:10 I guess she must have it
02:26:12 I don't know
02:26:14 what a fucking nightmare
02:26:16 we're gonna have to
02:26:18 bang on the door again
02:26:20 we've been banging on the door
02:26:22 we've been banging on the door
02:26:24 she just doesn't give a fuck
02:26:26 she just doesn't give a fuck
02:26:28 we're gonna have to reach out to Nate
02:26:30 and or Victor and just be like
02:26:32 look
02:26:34 you guys both have a head on your shoulders
02:26:36 you guys have a sense of responsibility
02:26:38 please help
02:26:40 I'm not even sure what it is
02:26:42 that she's got
02:26:44 well just to find out
02:26:46 you mean the film from the meetup
02:26:48 the meetup behind the scene
02:26:50 thrust the behind the scene stuff
02:26:52 okay
02:26:54 yeah
02:26:56 because at the end of every day
02:26:58 because she brought
02:27:00 her desktop to the house
02:27:02 and we would just dump all the footage
02:27:04 that we had onto there
02:27:06 because she was supposed to be putting the behind the scenes up every day
02:27:08 big mistake
02:27:10 that was the plan
02:27:12 things did not go according to plan
02:27:14 nightmare nightmare nightmare
02:27:16 um
02:27:18 okay well
02:27:20 we'll try to do something about that
02:27:22 maybe
02:27:24 do our best
02:27:26 next one is called
02:27:28 mind sweeper gone rogue
02:27:30 three two one go
02:27:32 demon crawl
02:27:34 is a mind sweeper
02:27:36 roguelike
02:27:38 demon crawl
02:27:48 oh let's see
02:27:52 fascinating
02:27:54 oh look it's mind sweeper
02:27:56 but there's treasure chests
02:27:58 let's get
02:28:02 what makes it a roguelike
02:28:04 and not
02:28:06 just a series of mind sweeper levels
02:28:08 nothing
02:28:12 i think mind sweeper itself
02:28:14 could be classified as a roguelike
02:28:16 it does have perma death
02:28:18 that's true
02:28:20 and it's procedurally generated
02:28:26 interesting
02:28:28 looks vaguely interesting
02:28:30 yeah
02:28:32 next voicemail is called
02:28:34 digital monster x
02:28:36 and there is an image attached
02:28:38 um i'll post it in the
02:28:40 on the thing
02:28:42 it's a picture of some digivices
02:28:44 i guess
02:28:46 there we go
02:28:48 dude those look sick
02:28:50 yeah these are like
02:28:52 is this the new version
02:28:54 that released like last year
02:28:56 i didn't even know there was a new version
02:28:58 but it's black and red
02:29:00 that's my favorite color combination
02:29:02 because i'm an edge lord
02:29:04 it's got bielzomon on the cover
02:29:06 who's fucking murdered leomon
02:29:08 it was fucking sick
02:29:10 the one in the bottom
02:29:12 who rode around a motorcycle
02:29:14 who was dressed in leather
02:29:16 and he fucking murdered one of the kids
02:29:18 didgymon in cold blood
02:29:20 and she cried about it and was awesome
02:29:22 is it the one with the big blue wings
02:29:24 and the gun
02:29:26 and the gun
02:29:28 okay the voicemail
02:29:30 digital monster x 3 2 1 go
02:29:32 an english version
02:29:34 of the digital monster x was just announced
02:29:36 so what's the difference between that
02:29:38 and the version 20 of which tom has
02:29:40 well first of all the english version
02:29:42 of both are gonna be way cheaper than the japanese counterpart
02:29:44 so now you have two options to pick from
02:29:46 however
02:29:48 here's the thing with the version 20
02:29:50 you get a raise 2 digimon at a time
02:29:52 and you have 10 aches to choose from
02:29:54 evolution branches
02:29:56 meanwhile the dmx only lets you raise one digimon at a time
02:29:58 you only get one egg
02:30:00 but the evolution tree and all the things in that branches
02:30:02 far more than any of the version
02:30:04 20th eggs
02:30:06 and finally it has like an rpg quest mode
02:30:08 so if you're fighting a 20th versus a 20th
02:30:10 or an x versus an x
02:30:12 they have a little mini game you can do
02:30:14 so there's a little bit of skill in fighting
02:30:16 but if you're fighting a 20th versus an x
02:30:18 not so much
02:30:20 so if you do a royal rumble you're probably gonna want to stick
02:30:22 to all 20th's
02:30:24 or all x
02:30:26 and I believe the version 20th
02:30:28 is the more beginner friendly of the two
02:30:30 however if you do the 20th
02:30:32 you enjoy it
02:30:34 but you want something new I then highly recommend
02:30:36 checking out the x when it comes out
02:30:38 I gotta watch a review
02:30:40 on that um
02:30:42 digimon youtubers channel
02:30:44 what was his name
02:30:46 oh god I don't remember
02:30:48 I can't remember his name
02:30:50 it's not out yet
02:30:52 but when it is
02:30:54 digimon digital monster
02:30:56 x is a brand new digital
02:30:58 monster virtual pet which is focusing
02:31:00 on x antibody
02:31:02 digimon
02:31:04 I don't know what that means
02:31:06 several mechanics from the
02:31:08 digimon pendulum x series
02:31:10 also make a return such as the xai
02:31:12 system this is gobbledygook
02:31:14 yeah there's a ton of
02:31:16 digimon vpets that came out in Japan
02:31:18 like one version before
02:31:20 these re-releases came out in the states
02:31:22 there's a lot that I don't know about
02:31:24 all I know is I just
02:31:26 went to Amazon to look for one and then they're related
02:31:28 there was the detamers d-arc
02:31:30 that I had
02:31:32 like three of back in the day and they're all gone now
02:31:34 and they're selling used for $573
02:31:36 uh
02:31:38 digimon's were so much money
02:31:42 cause it's like old and discontinued
02:31:44 is that why it's expensive
02:31:46 thousands of dollars worth of digimon merged
02:31:48 that just got lost when we moved houses
02:31:50 back in the day and it really hurts my soul
02:31:52 to know I could like pay off my student loans with
02:31:54 digimon toys but I can't
02:31:56 cause they're gone
02:31:58 oh no
02:32:00 I wonder if, I mean I had
02:32:02 I had an old digimon
02:32:04 from back in the day
02:32:06 it's no way it's worth anything
02:32:08 like the old
02:32:10 pre-pokemon ones even
02:32:12 those are worth a little bit
02:32:14 hmm
02:32:16 maybe I should look it up
02:32:18 the next voicemail is called
02:32:20 well it's just an image link
02:32:22 and this is the image
02:32:24 attached it's a drawing
02:32:26 of a bird man
02:32:28 looks pretty cool
02:32:30 so voicemail in 3, 2, 1, go
02:32:44 telling you that bandits from far away
02:32:46 seek to plunder your fortress
02:32:48 and steal what is yours
02:32:52 what do you do
02:32:54 um
02:32:56 bird, bird men
02:32:58 are warning us that bandits
02:33:00 are going to plunder our fortress
02:33:02 uh
02:33:04 DM I'd like to make a sleight of hand check
02:33:06 to try and steal pickpocket from the bird man
02:33:08 no you don't
02:33:10 you don't say
02:33:12 DM I want to make a sleight of hand check
02:33:14 you say I'm going to try
02:33:16 to pick the bird man's pockets
02:33:18 and then the DM says
02:33:20 okay make a sleight of hand check
02:33:22 did you see what I did there
02:33:24 that's how you fucking do it
02:33:26 you don't
02:33:28 talk in mechanical terms
02:33:30 the DM tells you the rules
02:33:32 bitch
02:33:34 I tick limitarily
02:33:36 lays an egg
02:33:38 and then I make an omelet with it
02:33:40 um
02:33:42 DM is the bird man
02:33:44 sexy
02:33:46 you got the image
02:33:48 oh I guess I have to choose myself
02:33:50 uh okay no
02:33:52 his head is too small
02:33:54 and he has no pupils
02:33:56 he has no pupils I don't mind that so much
02:33:58 DM do I believe this bird
02:34:00 do I believe this bird's claim
02:34:02 or do I find it dubious
02:34:04 okay alright I guess
02:34:06 you can make a sense mode of check
02:34:08 we're not the DM we gotta wait till next week
02:34:10 to know what all these options are
02:34:12 I will
02:34:14 okay my
02:34:16 uh I mean
02:34:18 I don't care I don't care what this bird man says
02:34:20 okay we'll just we'll maintain normal
02:34:22 fortifications we're always on guard
02:34:24 we're always on guard from bandits right we run a tight ship
02:34:26 uh
02:34:28 this is not helpful we all take
02:34:30 watch and shifts at night you know to make sure
02:34:32 that nobody syncs up on our encampment during
02:34:34 the evening we will
02:34:36 redouble our usual efforts
02:34:38 at repelling invaders
02:34:40 bird man you are
02:34:42 you are dismissed
02:34:44 get out of here
02:34:46 no does he have any weapons
02:34:48 maybe he could help us defend
02:34:50 defend our uh our encampment
02:34:52 is he armed? no
02:34:54 does he seem to have any arcane
02:34:56 gifts that could help
02:34:58 I don't want him in the fort
02:35:00 he's not one of us
02:35:02 why are you speciesist
02:35:04 is he who knows
02:35:06 I don't
02:35:08 in this world it's killer be killed
02:35:10 I think he's more likely
02:35:12 trying to pull some kind of ruse on us
02:35:14 well that's why you have to
02:35:16 see if we can leave them first
02:35:18 I dare not say the mechanics name
02:35:20 just in case I set you off again
02:35:22 but
02:35:24 fair enough
02:35:26 I don't believe it
02:35:28 believe it or not
02:35:30 believe it or don't believe it
02:35:32 I'm still like well what whatever
02:35:34 whatever
02:35:36 no
02:35:38 okay that's my take
02:35:40 wait I gotta
02:35:44 roll a d20
02:35:46 I gotta see what I get for my insight
02:35:48 I like it it's hard
02:35:50 it's hard and it's annoying
02:35:52 but I like it when like
02:35:54 I got an 18 plus my modifier for insight
02:35:56 I think
02:35:58 when you do a sense motive check
02:36:00 it's better if the dm rolls
02:36:02 I feel like the roll should be secret
02:36:04 like you shouldn't know like oh I got a great roll
02:36:06 or oh I got a terrible roll
02:36:08 because then you know what's real and what's not
02:36:10 but I mean
02:36:12 we're limited
02:36:14 I feel like it helps with immersion
02:36:16 if the dm rolls does all the rolls
02:36:18 but it also it kind of like empowers the player to feel like
02:36:20 their stats are doing well
02:36:22 if they know what the roll is
02:36:24 so it really depends on what side of the equation you want to kind of
02:36:26 it depends on the roll
02:36:28 I don't do this for like an attack or something
02:36:30 or like most even something like picking a lock
02:36:32 I would let the player roll but for something like sense motive
02:36:34 like
02:36:36 if the entire party rolls sense motive
02:36:38 and you know you get a bunch of rolls
02:36:40 I think it's better if they don't know what they rolled
02:36:42 because then all they know is who believes
02:36:44 and who doesn't
02:36:46 and then all they can do is like okay well
02:36:48 this guy has got a good intuition stat
02:36:50 he's like usually pretty perceptive
02:36:52 maybe we should believe
02:36:54 him because he's more likely to be right
02:36:56 but you never know
02:36:58 sometimes it could be wrong
02:37:00 I think that's the best way to do it
02:37:02 usually an insight
02:37:04 something that's just a character
02:37:06 and two it's like internally
02:37:08 so even just like having the roll be
02:37:10 announced is difficult
02:37:12 like that's kind of like
02:37:14 the struggle with table top is like
02:37:16 even knowing that you
02:37:18 had to make a roll for it at all
02:37:20 is sort of giving the game away a little bit
02:37:22 I think that
02:37:24 if you think about it the numbers
02:37:26 the rolling of the dice
02:37:28 is to offset
02:37:30 the fact that you can't literally
02:37:32 do these things in real life
02:37:34 if you have charisma
02:37:36 like not in real life but in the game
02:37:38 you roll a high number
02:37:40 if you don't know what you rolled
02:37:42 and you have to convince your party
02:37:44 of something
02:37:46 if you don't personally have charisma
02:37:48 but you rolled a high enough how are you supposed to
02:37:50 like you can't really convince them
02:37:52 with your real life stats
02:37:54 I think
02:37:56 that in a case like that
02:37:58 you shouldn't be able to
02:38:00 just like make
02:38:02 I think it's better if generally
02:38:04 you don't like roll charisma
02:38:06 checks to convince your party of things
02:38:08 because then you
02:38:10 if you make a really high roll
02:38:12 then that ends up forcing other players
02:38:14 to play their characters
02:38:16 in a way that they don't actually want to
02:38:18 unless it's like a physical check
02:38:20 that just happens naturally
02:38:22 like if the players believe you or not
02:38:24 it's just a matter of you being able to convince them
02:38:26 at the table
02:38:28 that's a point where the rules
02:38:30 kind of break down
02:38:32 where the rules and the role playing
02:38:34 kind of clash with each other
02:38:36 and you sort of have to choose which one
02:38:38 you're going to prioritize
02:38:40 there
02:38:42 some character just imagining
02:38:44 you have to convince a guard
02:38:46 to let you in
02:38:48 let me in, you want to let me in
02:38:50 and it's like not convincing at all
02:38:52 but they roll a really high number so it works
02:38:54 and then everything seems a little stupid
02:38:56 well at that point it's up to the DM
02:38:58 whether they want to allow it to happen
02:39:00 or not
02:39:02 the DM has the last say
02:39:04 even like in a situation where you roll a nat 20
02:39:06 if it's like I'm rolling
02:39:08 to like fucking insta kill God
02:39:10 like you're not going to get a success on a nat 20
02:39:12 because like with skill checks
02:39:14 a nat 20 isn't an instant success
02:39:16 it's just 20 plus your score
02:39:18 because you can set up a debility check
02:39:20 like that outside of damage
02:39:22 to be like 47
02:39:24 or something insane like that
02:39:26 that you just can't clear
02:39:28 if they were trying to lie their way in
02:39:30 and they just said like let me in
02:39:32 cause you want to
02:39:34 I would probably be like as the DM
02:39:36 I'd say like that's not even a lie
02:39:38 like you just fucked it up
02:39:40 it doesn't matter what you roll
02:39:42 like you simply didn't do the thing
02:39:44 it still depends on whether the roll is
02:39:46 for the
02:39:48 like how good the lie is
02:39:50 or like the stupidity of the guard
02:39:52 in question
02:39:54 I think letting the players roll
02:39:56 even if you know that they're not going to
02:39:58 succeed just helps the game feel more
02:40:00 feels like they're actively participating
02:40:02 you should definitely
02:40:04 you should definitely make them roll
02:40:06 sometimes when there's
02:40:08 like literally no purpose to it
02:40:10 just so they don't know
02:40:12 what's real and what's not
02:40:14 yeah that's a good
02:40:16 that's a good DMing
02:40:18 if you roll a 20 on a strength
02:40:20 and they're trying to push a boulder
02:40:22 it doesn't matter how strong
02:40:24 they roll they can't push it
02:40:26 too big
02:40:28 unless they have like some kind of like superhuman
02:40:30 strength score
02:40:32 but like most normal characters won't
02:40:34 like you can roll a nat 20 on a strength check
02:40:36 and be like your muscles flex real nice
02:40:38 and everyone thinks you look cool with the rock doesn't
02:40:40 it's DM's discretion but I think
02:40:42 if you did that and you roll the nat
02:40:44 20 I might be tempted to be like
02:40:46 it is physically impossible to move this boulder
02:40:48 but it just so happens that it was
02:40:50 sitting on some like unstable ground
02:40:52 which kind of gives in and the boulder moves
02:40:54 like maybe
02:40:56 it depends
02:40:58 there was an interesting like uh like simplified
02:41:00 rule set for tabletop I was looking at
02:41:02 that was based on 2d6's
02:41:04 and it was like under under 7 was
02:41:06 a failure
02:41:08 and 9 was a yes but
02:41:10 so like you succeed at what you have to do
02:41:12 but something bad happens
02:41:14 and then like an 11 or 12 was just a straight success
02:41:16 I thought that was pretty interesting
02:41:18 that is interesting like that's like improv
02:41:20 yeah the yes yes but
02:41:22 that's cool
02:41:24 it's kind of like
02:41:26 I like that because it follows the like the rule
02:41:28 of storytelling that it's not like
02:41:30 it's it's like
02:41:32 what is it like that there's that tray parker matt stone
02:41:34 talk where they talk about
02:41:36 the columbine shooters
02:41:38 yeah the columbine shooter
02:41:40 it's it's not yes and that's the improv thing
02:41:42 it's like
02:41:44 they're talking about like a story has to progress
02:41:46 according to like
02:41:48 and then
02:41:50 because
02:41:52 and then and then and then it's and then
02:41:54 so therefore
02:41:56 you know it's like one one
02:41:58 leads into the other and there's like some sort of
02:42:00 I don't know
02:42:02 I guess it's not quite the same
02:42:04 never mind
02:42:06 next voicemail is called
02:42:08 Sam 3 2 1
02:42:10 go
02:42:12 hey guys
02:42:14 so this is the first time I'm
02:42:16 doing one of these
02:42:18 so my apologies
02:42:20 if
02:42:22 correctly or you're doing good
02:42:24 incorrect format
02:42:26 but I'm in college
02:42:28 and
02:42:30 because of the virus and all
02:42:32 I don't have any friends
02:42:34 pretty lonely
02:42:36 I'm stuck in a room all day
02:42:38 I was just wondering
02:42:40 if you guys had any advice on how to
02:42:42 make friends in college
02:42:44 or how to meet new people
02:42:46 I mean to do it
02:42:48 I hope you all have a great day
02:42:50 I mean I the whole
02:42:52 the whole virus situation is
02:42:54 a little bit
02:42:56 nobody knows how to cope with that
02:42:58 yeah I mean obviously
02:43:00 we didn't have to deal with that when we were
02:43:02 in college because there was no
02:43:04 coronavirus at the time
02:43:06 I mean I can give you the usual
02:43:08 fucking
02:43:10 advice under normal circumstances
02:43:12 it would be join
02:43:14 groups, join extracurriculars
02:43:16 join like study groups for your classes
02:43:18 or whatever
02:43:20 chat with your classmates after class
02:43:22 and I don't know
02:43:24 see what they're up to and
02:43:26 make
02:43:28 not to
02:43:30 I'm going to sound a little salty
02:43:32 but making friends in college is so fucking easy
02:43:34 it's so easy
02:43:36 and if you can't do it in college
02:43:38 then you might as well just fucking kill yourself
02:43:40 because that's the easiest time and you're fucked
02:43:42 uh no
02:43:44 that was a terrible thing
02:43:46 a terrible thing I just said
02:43:50 the thing is like it's easy to make friends
02:43:52 in college because like you have a bunch of people
02:43:54 the same age it's easy to find
02:43:56 like people who are pursuing the same kind of
02:43:58 general goals that you are because
02:44:00 there's tons of like
02:44:02 clubs and stuff but
02:44:04 in the current situation
02:44:06 that's all undercut
02:44:08 the point of college is like it's a bunch
02:44:10 of people of like a similar background
02:44:12 generally who are all
02:44:14 convened together to spend years
02:44:16 doing structured activities
02:44:18 with one another like it's the
02:44:20 it's like the ultimate like
02:44:22 like acquaintance building
02:44:24 engine
02:44:26 uh after school
02:44:28 out of school it's like
02:44:30 nothing is like that anymore
02:44:32 if it wasn't for the internet I would have made a single friend
02:44:34 from 2011
02:44:36 to now
02:44:38 because I haven't I literally haven't made a single friend
02:44:40 in the real world in the last decade
02:44:42 I made
02:44:44 uh I've met
02:44:46 I've met some a couple
02:44:48 people in the real world but like not
02:44:50 yeah mainly I've made friends
02:44:52 that I originally knew through the internet
02:44:54 uh cringe
02:44:56 uh cringe
02:44:58 um
02:45:00 oh man
02:45:02 yeah the coronavirus
02:45:04 with not being able to like
02:45:06 physically be with people
02:45:08 from college is probably
02:45:10 I'm sure the coronavirus
02:45:12 is making it ten times harder
02:45:14 than it's supposed to be so
02:45:16 yeah I mean college makes it
02:45:18 easier but the coronavirus makes it way harder
02:45:20 so maybe it balances out
02:45:22 at the very least if you have like zoom
02:45:24 groups or discord groups or whatever
02:45:26 for your classes talking
02:45:28 those I just really all I can
02:45:30 think of yeah joining clubs
02:45:32 and groups is good there's
02:45:34 one that you want that doesn't exist
02:45:36 try starting one and uh
02:45:38 I would say what happens nobody
02:45:40 shows interest and you're in the exact same
02:45:42 position you're in now so I would say
02:45:44 get vaccinated
02:45:46 early if possible
02:45:48 I know that's not possible for everyone
02:45:50 and then
02:45:52 after you know after the coronavirus
02:45:54 is dealt with to whatever extent it can be
02:45:56 be I don't know
02:45:58 this is hard and I don't and I
02:46:00 struggle to do this as well but like
02:46:02 just try and like be
02:46:04 out of your room
02:46:06 be out in places
02:46:08 I know it sounds stupid it sounds
02:46:10 like what's the point of that like what I'm just gonna go
02:46:12 and like stand somewhere like yes
02:46:14 to a certain to a certain extent yes
02:46:16 you should just like leave your room
02:46:18 and go somewhere
02:46:20 any literally anywhere anywhere other
02:46:22 people are simply for the sake
02:46:24 of being there there's just like a commons area
02:46:26 where you could like get snacks
02:46:28 and just tables like sit and like study
02:46:30 and do stuff like out
02:46:32 of your room I spent a lot of time there and I would just
02:46:34 like run into people I knew from class because like
02:46:36 it was right above the cafeteria so when people would
02:46:38 get food they'd walk by there and I would just say hi
02:46:40 it was a good place to kind of just like
02:46:42 naturally start conversation with people
02:46:44 that you like had seen around
02:46:46 so something like that when the weather gets
02:46:48 better just being outside
02:46:50 if you're on campus like just working outside
02:46:52 doing some studying outside and like
02:46:54 just just kind of like reaching out
02:46:56 to somebody who you've seen in class
02:46:58 and you might have an interest
02:47:00 in striking up conversation with even
02:47:02 if like you don't know
02:47:04 exactly what the conversation is
02:47:06 going to be about just like putting yourself
02:47:08 in the situation even though it feels like really
02:47:10 scary of just like saying hi to somebody
02:47:12 you'll naturally get better at doing it
02:47:14 so it'll be
02:47:16 easier going forward each time to talk to
02:47:18 more people
02:47:20 yeah
02:47:22 I think that's pretty
02:47:24 good advice
02:47:26 I think we've pretty much solved this guy's whole
02:47:28 life now
02:47:30 I think he's good
02:47:32 you're welcome
02:47:34 Sam
02:47:36 let us know how it goes I guess
02:47:38 the last voicemail
02:47:40 I think is called
02:47:42 download ruffle
02:47:44 3 2 1 go
02:47:46 boy download ruffle
02:47:48 it's a flash emulator that can install your browser
02:47:50 as well as your computer
02:47:52 preserve flash as much as you can
02:47:54 download ruffle right now
02:47:56 okay
02:47:58 okay
02:48:00 I like playing the old flash
02:48:02 video games online
02:48:04 so is what I'm hearing
02:48:06 that if you have ruffle
02:48:08 you can play old flash games
02:48:10 is that
02:48:12 it seems to be saying
02:48:14 so it's basically just someone remade flash
02:48:16 it's probably like some sort of emulator
02:48:20 I don't
02:48:22 I mean
02:48:24 what's the difference
02:48:26 yeah flash player emulator written in rust
02:48:28 yeah it just emulates
02:48:30 the flash environment
02:48:32 but it's written
02:48:34 I assume it's written in rust but it probably
02:48:36 works with the html5 so it runs in modern web browsers
02:48:38 without
02:48:40 I mean flash is just a program
02:48:42 flash is just software how do you
02:48:44 emulate software don't you just
02:48:46 wouldn't you just have
02:48:48 written the software again
02:48:52 it's I mean it's the same way you emulate
02:48:54 like a super nintendo I guess
02:48:56 super nintendo is a software
02:48:58 well it's hardware and software
02:49:00 sure and like you're emulating the hardware
02:49:02 and the software that it runs
02:49:04 in order to run the applications
02:49:06 and you're just emulating
02:49:08 the software of flash player
02:49:12 I guess so I guess so
02:49:14 well that's I mean I'm glad there's a
02:49:16 I'm glad there's an alternative
02:49:18 I'm glad there's a plant based alternative
02:49:20 to flash
02:49:24 does this mean I can read old homestuck
02:49:28 maybe
02:49:30 I don't know
02:49:32 wait does old homestuck even exist anymore
02:49:34 I mean the MS Paint Adventures
02:49:36 got like redirected to homestuck.com
02:49:38 so I don't know
02:49:40 actually if all that stuff is there
02:49:42 but I think a few pages have like
02:49:44 you can go to the top right and like
02:49:46 switch to the flash version of the page
02:49:48 like cascade
02:49:50 which is way way better
02:49:52 than the video
02:49:54 on the ruffle homepage they have a
02:49:56 version of alien hominid running in ruffle
02:49:58 you can just play alien hominid on here
02:50:00 hell yeah
02:50:02 that's pretty based
02:50:06 download ruffle I guess
02:50:08 well we're at two hours
02:50:10 and 50 minutes
02:50:12 and eliazar says keep it under three
02:50:14 hours so
