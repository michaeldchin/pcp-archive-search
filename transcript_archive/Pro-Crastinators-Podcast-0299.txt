00:00:35 believe it. Can't believe it. It's a Friday once again.
00:00:42 Hello. Jumping right in. Episode 299 of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. It's me, Ben Saint,
00:00:51 and Oblivionfall is with me today. This week. Hey. I almost had to do another solo Bencast.
00:01:00 Everyone's favorite. But Oblivion jumped in to save me from that. I'm always hovering.
00:01:06 I'm always the specter. The specter of the solo Bencast is always hovering, floating,
00:01:12 just out of reach, haunting me. It's just a matter of staving it off. Yeah. How's it
00:01:23 going? What's up? What is up, dog? I'm here. The people have spoken. I read the comments.
00:01:32 They said, Oblivion, come back. And I did. Yeah. Put the baby in a blimba. Yeah, everybody
00:01:41 liked that. I was shocked to click on that episode and just hear my voice and I'm like,
00:01:46 what the fuck? Why am I at this? I wasn't on this episode and then I remembered. I had
00:01:52 some leftover voicemails I sent last week. Old ones that never got used. I was like,
00:01:58 oh, yeah. It was shocking. Shocking. What could this be doing here? Oh, I put it here. Yeah,
00:02:04 I said it was clean. Yeah, I said it was. Yeah, I kicked the habit. Well, how's your week been?
00:02:17 My week's been pretty productive. Because I haven't been productive enough, I did other
00:02:23 productive things. I was supposed to have my animation project done this month. I thought
00:02:28 for sure I could get it by January 15th. And so I realized shit, it's not going to be done. I
00:02:36 got to put something on Patreon. I guess I'll do another sketch dump because it's been about six
00:02:42 months. I want to do a sketch dump at least every six months. So I had to clean up a bunch of old
00:02:46 sketches. And I don't know if I can really share them because they're pornographic. So
00:02:54 of course. Just trust that at patreon.com slash oblivion. I did some good boob and penis and it's
00:03:03 good. I believe you. I believe you. I think I owe my patrons a Q&A. I haven't done a Q&A in a
00:03:15 couple of months because for a few months I've been like, well, I don't want to do a Q&A until
00:03:19 after the game is out. Because that's what I think people are going to want to talk about.
00:03:25 So I would put that off for a little while. Well, I was going to say I thought the game
00:03:31 would be done this month, but it is done this month. I was talking about this last week. I've
00:03:37 been drawing more of slime punishment because I need to have the comic done because the game and
00:03:43 the end of the comic are intertwined. They are one and the same. So I've been drawing that.
00:03:52 And then I realized I was like, okay, maybe I got like 30 pages. That's not so bad. So I started
00:03:57 cranking them out. I think I've done like 17. It'll probably be more than 30. It'll probably
00:04:02 be like 35 or 40. But then I realized, shit, I know what I have to draw up until the game.
00:04:11 And then I know what I have to draw is what happens immediately after the game.
00:04:18 And then that's the end of the comic. Slime and punishment is over. So I have to draw an ending
00:04:24 and I have no idea what the ending is. I know the climax. I don't know like, okay,
00:04:30 but what's the ending ending like? And they lived happily ever after. I don't know what I want to do
00:04:35 for that. So I have to think of that, I guess. I'm surprised. I'm surprised that wasn't like
00:04:46 planned way ahead. Well, I mean,
00:04:55 well, I mean, slime and punishment was an evolving thing because I kept changing it in
00:05:00 response to, you know, Chris Chan making up weird shit at me.
00:05:08 Waking up weird shit. They would never. They did. I did incorporate some things that she
00:05:16 told me in DMs. She would occasionally send me some weird DMs about like what she thinks should
00:05:23 happen. And I did incorporate some of that. I guess I don't mind spoiling a little bit.
00:05:32 For instance, you know, in S. Revert, Laka Kam falls in the alpha timeline and crushes Chris
00:05:39 Chan, Sonichu. But she mentioned in a DM that like an alternate version of herself would become
00:05:48 quote unquote corrupted by slime. So I have a little narrator's note from Discord,
00:05:54 the draconiquus, that there's an alternate version of Chris that is still in Laka Kam.
00:06:02 It's just like a slime junkie, just like sleeping in between dumpsters or whatever. It's great.
00:06:09 You know how it is. So I'm getting further on that. I will surely have it done this
00:06:19 in February, probably early February. I hope it won't even take. I hope it won't take most of the
00:06:25 month. Yeah. Damn. And then, I don't know, maybe I can like make some money selling,
00:06:37 doing a Kickstarter for a book of that in the not too distant future. That would be cool.
00:06:45 That wouldn't be. I need to buy me one of those plebeian that we blew rays, but my
00:06:52 PayPal is sadly drained. As I had one of, okay, so you know how I do those,
00:07:01 those Milo Pony Vector Commissions, I still do them.
00:07:04 Yeah. Especially now that I don't have a job, it's an easy way to get and come on the side.
00:07:09 There was one that I offered a refund to like back in December, because very design
00:07:16 was just a little too much. It didn't work. It wasn't like some like super like,
00:07:21 OC do not steal like a million like wings and stripes or whatever. It wasn't that sort of
00:07:26 issue. It was just with the hair. Just looked like it would be a pain to do with how my roots work.
00:07:32 Yeah. It was like really wavy and had stripes in it. And I was just like,
00:07:37 that's difficult to handle with my templates. So I just said, hey, offer a refund, you know,
00:07:43 I'll even give you 10 bucks extra because you waited, you know, about a year or more since,
00:07:49 because I accepted a big bachelor way back and took on way too many. So this person had been
00:07:53 waiting like a year. So I said, I'll give you 10 bucks extra. And then I don't hear anything for
00:08:00 like a month and a half. Yeah. And I'm just sitting there. I'm like, okay. And my PayPal is
00:08:05 getting a little smaller, my balance, but I still had like just enough in there to pay them back.
00:08:10 And then then I get an invoice from them. And it's like, they're like, in the invoice, it's like,
00:08:17 hey, sorry, I asked for 10 bucks extra. And I'm like, what do you mean? And I'm sitting here thinking
00:08:23 I already offered to give them 10 extra. What are we talking about? You were gonna give them
00:08:27 10 extra as like a sorry, can't take your commission. Here's $10 to cheer you up about it.
00:08:34 And then they were like, sorry, I'm putting 10 bucks extra on the invoice. And the invoice was
00:08:41 30 extra. So I was like, well, no, no, your math is not good. And then I was just annoyed. And I'm
00:08:50 like, you know, I actually only like received like $124 because PayPal like charged a $6 fee at
00:08:57 my end. So the 10 bucks extra is technically only going to be four bucks extra for you.
00:09:04 Because I never actually received the full 130 that was agreed on way back.
00:09:11 So that was a thing that happened. And then PayPal charged me like another $5 just to send
00:09:19 them the money back because of course it did. Yeah, wherever I receive or send money,
00:09:25 the charges only come out of my end and never the other person's end. It's weird.
00:09:29 Yeah, I saw you're, I don't know why you have like weird PayPal issues.
00:09:37 Yeah, someone thought maybe they switched me to like a business account or something,
00:09:42 like against my knowledge. I don't know. But like when I send like 20 bucks and it charges
00:09:49 me like almost five bucks worth of fees. And I'm like, that's not how it's not how it's supposed
00:09:55 to work. Yeah, definitely not how it's supposed to work. Yeah, the fees are really high for me.
00:09:59 And it might be because my account is like based in New Zealand, but they don't let me change it.
00:10:04 They say it's against policy to change the region. And I've been trying to like,
00:10:07 What if you move? I did. I mean, exactly. I move like almost six years ago,
00:10:13 I moved to America and I still am so confused. New Zealand PayPal account that tries to convert
00:10:18 everything to New Zealand dollars and I keep going to be like, no, keep it in America dollars.
00:10:21 I don't want even more conversion fees. And I tried setting up a new one and they're like,
00:10:27 oh yeah, you can't set up a new one unless you send us a picture of your driver's license or
00:10:32 if you have a bill that has your name on it, I can't get either of those things. My apartment
00:10:38 complex, we don't get bills. Like everything is like handled in the rent. There are no bills.
00:10:43 Like they're just none. And I don't have a driver's license and because I don't
00:10:48 fucking want to drive. At least not at the moment. My husband takes me everywhere I need to go if
00:10:55 I need to go somewhere. So I've had a PayPal account for like your housewife.
00:11:03 Yeah, totally. No, no, I'm just for cool. I'm just a cool cackling at your expense.
00:11:13 I'm the cool artist man and my husband is my chauffeur. Okay. But yeah, that PayPal account,
00:11:19 I tried setting up three or four years ago. And there's I when I first set it up, I like
00:11:24 accepted a few commissions. So there's a couple hundred bucks just sitting in there. And I can't
00:11:28 access it. I can look at it, but I can't touch it. In your PayPal? Yeah, in my American PayPal
00:11:34 that I set up. It's the same one I use for the PCP dating sim OST, which made about $80, which is
00:11:40 alright. I'm sure the work on that was worth more than $80, but it was definitely worth more.
00:11:47 Yeah, just the fucking, the fucking like little music video I made that went on the PCP channel
00:11:54 like a week to do. Yeah, it looked great. I don't know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But that's, you know,
00:12:03 I'm actually really bothered by I, for some reason, after effects, if you have a wave file,
00:12:12 and of course, wave is like the best sound quality, like it's the most losses format.
00:12:18 If you have a wave file and after effects, I found this out when I was editing the PCP way back,
00:12:25 is there will be little popping and clicking sounds that'll start appearing in the audio. If it's,
00:12:32 if the audio is really long, like say an hour long, more than an hour long, around 30 to 40
00:12:36 minutes, and you'll start hearing little clicks and pops, and they get louder and more frequent.
00:12:40 And by the end of the video, it's like,
00:12:42 like, and it's like really like harsh sounds that it really, that's just okay. So what you're
00:12:49 saying is after effects like just simply doesn't process audio, correct? Yeah, like really long
00:12:55 lossless audio formats just kind of sound fucked up towards the end. And you have to either use an
00:13:00 mp free, or, which I guess I could have just done that. Or what I usually do is I use X media
00:13:09 recode to remix the audio afterwards. It basically just lets you like, you just swap out the audio
00:13:14 file for a different one and the video information is untouched. So you don't lose any quality.
00:13:18 And also it's really fast. It takes like two seconds. So that's what I did for the PCP episodes.
00:13:24 I forgot to do that for a dating sim because I wanted it, the soundtrack to come out exactly one
00:13:27 week after. And I was already like, running late on that day. And I guess I just forgot to so
00:13:33 the video went up with shitty audio and it's just been like that. And I've been mad about it.
00:13:39 Silently for like two years almost. Two years. Who would hold a grudge? Who would hold a grudge for
00:13:49 years of Libyan fall? Who would hold on to anger for that long? You know? I only anger against
00:13:55 myself. I don't, I can't hold grudges against other people. I'm incapable. It's like the Buddha
00:14:00 said grudges are like holding on to a hot coal thinking I'll throw it at, one day I'll throw it
00:14:08 at my enemy. Unironically, that's how I feel. Your enemy is yourself. Well, yeah, it's just
00:14:17 sitting up my ass, keeping it warm, I guess. I don't know. I've never been able to stay mad at
00:14:25 people. And there've been people who have like completely fucked me over who I've just forgiven
00:14:29 and like let back into my life. And that's happened a lot. And usually how does that work out?
00:14:35 It doesn't usually work out great. Granted, like it's not usually people who are like
00:14:40 really like fucking annoying. Like it's usually people who work close to me about it.
00:14:46 Like family or stuff like that where I've been like oof.
00:14:50 Yeah. But man, I'm mad. That's that's personal poopiness. I don't know where I'm going. It's
00:15:00 seems he's saying you might jump in. That'd be cool.
00:15:03 It seems like he's gonna. I'm glad you thank I'm glad you mentioned the the blue rays though.
00:15:10 Link in the description.
00:15:13 stcomics.com slash store.html for the store. $20, $20 cent fee $5. Unbelievable.
00:15:25 Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. It's not for me when I get
00:15:31 I have I have orders for the blue rays have continued to trickle in. I have sold
00:15:36 about twice as many as I expected. Hey, Simsie. Hey, how's it going? Whoa. It's
00:15:40 Hey, leave the episode. Yo, well, that's three three man three man tag team today.
00:15:49 It's better than nothing.
00:15:53 You are recording, right? Yeah, I just started recording.
00:15:57 We'll do a sync at the end there.
00:15:59 Wait, let's do let's do a sync right now. On the on the count of three, say sync. One,
00:16:04 two, three, sync. One, two, three, sync. So I was just gonna say
00:16:13 I have sold about twice as many as I expected to sell my first batch of 50.
00:16:19 I have basically I think I have literally one more left of my second batch of 50.
00:16:26 So if I if two more people order blue rays, I will have to I will have to buy another set of
00:16:32 blank DVDs and cases for them, which is fine. When when people order it through when they order
00:16:41 it through when they when they just DM me and ask like where do I send the money and I give them
00:16:45 my my email address. Sometimes they choose, you know, buy as a buy it as a, you know, by a service
00:16:53 or item, which charges I think it's about 5% of a fee, which is not very much. So I don't mind
00:17:00 it that much. The best outcome is that they choose like buy through friends and family.
00:17:05 And then there's no fee at all, which is which is great. So I like that, although I don't blame
00:17:11 anyone for not wanting to do that, because like, you know, they are, if I were to rip them off,
00:17:16 they would they would have no way to like file a complaint and request their money back through
00:17:20 PayPal. So fair enough. And then the button that I made for the store page,
00:17:27 stcomics.com slash store.html is that one also charges a fee, but it charges like
00:17:33 ever so slightly more like instead of charging $1.50 for a $35 transaction, it charges like $1.65.
00:17:41 And I don't know why that is, but it's an insignificant difference. So I have not interrogated
00:17:47 it. But I did notice it and I thought it was odd. Yeah, fuck you. It's crazy. Evil PayPal's feeling
00:17:55 little man's money again. Elon Musk. Elon Musk. He's got he needs that $1.65 to build his big fucking
00:18:02 rocket ship that you can jerk off on his way to the moon in. Does he still does he still like run
00:18:08 PayPal or has he like sold it? I don't know. He was one of the guys who made it. I don't know like
00:18:13 if he's still involved in it. Yeah, but it's funny to blame everything on him because he's
00:18:18 dick face weirdo. Absolutely. And of course. How's your week, Simsie? How have you been?
00:18:27 Not too bad. I felt really sick last night. So I called in sick for work and I was like,
00:18:31 I ain't coming in. And then I got a text from work today saying, ha ha, even though you work
00:18:35 overnight and there's no customers there, you can't wear headphones anymore. So it's like, oh,
00:18:40 fuck. What the fuck? I'm going to be stacking shelves for eight hours without headphones on.
00:18:47 I'm going to go insane. I don't know. I think they said something about like people who come in
00:18:53 closer to when like the store opens. They leave their headphones in when the customers come in,
00:18:58 you're not allowed to do that. So they've just banned the whole thing. It was really annoying
00:19:03 for someone like me who only works when the store's closed. That's so awesome. That's so awesome.
00:19:11 I can't listen to the PCP while I'm stacking shelves. This is like how they insist that
00:19:20 like cashiers stand, like cashiers are not allowed to sit. Yeah, it's one of those type of things.
00:19:25 One of those is just like, I the boss just think that work should just be worse for me.
00:19:31 I just feel like it should be worse. So it is now. And that's good.
00:19:35 I'm really annoyed. I'm not looking forward to it. There's literally no reason they couldn't just
00:19:40 cashiers couldn't just sit. Luckily, my contract ends in March. So it's not going to be too bad
00:19:48 because it's going to be like a month of fucking pain. And then I'm going to say like,
00:19:54 please don't bother extending me. I don't want to work here anymore.
00:19:59 That's why I shop at Aldi. Aldi lets their cashiers sit.
00:20:03 Also, they're cheaper. Actually, I don't even shop at Aldi anymore because they don't have the
00:20:09 brand of ice cream that I like. Amazing. They don't have Knicks. Hey, Gib, what's up?
00:20:15 Hey. Hello. Hello. There we go. Now I hear you. Nothing's up, really.
00:20:26 It was a slow week. I had a slow week because, wait, I already explained the whole thing about
00:20:34 how I'm drawing the pages, right? I already said that. You did mention that last time. Yeah.
00:20:39 Well, I mentioned it again this week. I'm just doing that. So that's my week.
00:20:50 What have you been, Gib? I've been okay. I've been like fucking...
00:20:57 I don't know. There's been the secret project and that's going along.
00:21:09 And then there's been a lot of ghost mailing stuff. And I've packaged some envelopes up
00:21:13 in tomorrow. They're going to come around, pick them up. And I got to buy a bunch more
00:21:19 for sending to all over the globe. There's one in Japan. There's a few in Chile.
00:21:27 And Greece and France and Belgium and fucking everywhere.
00:21:31 Is the guy... I have a suspicion about who the guy in Japan is. I think it might be the same
00:21:37 guy I talked to this week who is the same guy who does a lot of the like PCP, like the music
00:21:42 voicemails. It could be. There's one guy in Japan. He ordered a road to Radcon. He was a
00:21:48 Kickstarter backer. He ordered a Blu-ray. And he's in the comments too. He's the guy who...
00:21:55 Fuck. I forget what his handle is, but he's a...
00:22:00 It's the Pink Floyd guy.
00:22:03 Amazing. Anyway, I just like... It was a mastermind.
00:22:10 Dark horse.
00:22:13 But yeah, it's mostly just been like... My thing for this pickup is mostly to America.
00:22:24 They can come to my house and pick it up and put the labels on at their warehouse,
00:22:29 which is epic and nice. But for basically every other place that isn't America,
00:22:36 I need to go through Royal Mail, which is the cheapest option, but it requires
00:22:41 that I go to one of... I bring everything to a post office and I have to print the labels and
00:22:48 stick them on myself, which is like, yeah, it's a hassle. I got to do that.
00:22:53 You heard it here first, people. If you bought one of Gibbs Comics and live outside of America,
00:22:58 fuck you. How dare you?
00:23:00 No, no. It's just that I've yet to do that. And I don't know. I could barely believe a week has
00:23:09 passed. I didn't even notice. Yeah. I mean, same. I feel like that a lot. I feel like that a lot,
00:23:17 but I got to say something. I got to get in here and I got to convert my lived experience
00:23:26 into content somehow. I feel time just slipping away a lot. I don't notice the weeks anymore.
00:23:33 Maybe it's because of my horrendous scheduled sleep and work, but I just don't fucking realize
00:23:39 when one day it ends and the other one begins. I know this is... Oh, this is where everyone's
00:23:43 quarantine started, but fuck me. It's just been awful. I don't know what's happening. I don't
00:23:50 know where I am in the world. I don't know what's going on. We had a blizzard here yesterday,
00:23:57 so it was like a foot or two of snow outside, which has compounded the issue. Since New
00:24:07 Year, since everyone here got COVID, I have not been working out. I have gotten off of the
00:24:13 schedule wherein I used to go over to Munchie and Kazi's house and lift three times a week,
00:24:20 and I have not been doing that this month. And it's bad. That was a ritual, I guess,
00:24:30 that I had that got me out of the house, but not anymore. I'm hoping that starts up again soon.
00:24:36 Munchie's school schedule is like, I guess he's like, I don't know what my good schedule is.
00:24:44 Figure it out, bro. Compounds the like, I don't know. I don't do anything. I don't
00:24:53 leave my house. I have no reference point for when one week starts and another ends.
00:25:00 I mean, I've, working on The Secret Project has been really fun, and I really enjoy that,
00:25:05 which is why I can't wait to release it and then tell people, so I can talk about it in public.
00:25:10 Yeah. I know what you mean. So the days feel the same, but they're good days. It's not like I'm
00:25:20 like, despairing about everything. It's just sort of like, what the fuck, time passes?
00:25:25 Yeah. I can measure time passed in pages of slime and punishment drawn.
00:25:36 And you can get back to drawing comics as well.
00:25:38 That's really how it feels. I think I got, this week I have like 17 panels drawn,
00:25:47 which is not as many as I should have for a whole week, but that's what I got.
00:25:55 So that's like, if a day goes by and I don't do any, it's like, well, today might as well not
00:26:03 have even happened. What am I doing? I get that feeling a lot, where if I haven't drawn anything
00:26:08 that day, I would just be like, oh, I didn't exist. I didn't, it didn't happen. Nothing,
00:26:13 nothing happened today. Yeah. Before that, it was, when I was making the game, it was,
00:26:19 I would have like a to-do list. I would have like my items on the to-do list, like bugs
00:26:23 that needed fixing or like assets I needed to make. And it would be like, how many items
00:26:26 did I cross off the to-do list? That was how I used to measure it. Yeah.
00:26:31 My criteria has been like, unless something has gone up on my Twitter or my Patreon,
00:26:37 the day has not counted. It's not been a thing. It's, it's unreal.
00:26:42 Absolutely. Absolutely.
00:26:44 But I've been pretty good about that recently. I was in a big art slump for like all of fucking
00:26:47 December. And then over the last month, I've slowly built up the steam again. And I'm putting
00:26:53 down a lot more than I used to. And I've actually started using my Patreon for the fucking first
00:26:58 time in like six months. Yeah, I've seen, I've seen you've been drawing a lot of, of one piece
00:27:05 girls. Yeah. Yeah. It's mostly because my, my friend has gotten into one piece recently. So
00:27:10 we've been talking about it a lot. And it's just like, cool rules. It's the best thing ever.
00:27:15 Yeah. It, I mean, it is. It's perfect. I've been seeing you, I've been seeing you draw that maid
00:27:22 girl. Oh yeah. The milkmaid. That's fun. I don't know if she has a name. Amelia. I mean,
00:27:28 it doesn't really matter, but yeah. She looks similar to I smell. Yeah. I have two characters
00:27:35 that wear the exact same thing. And I realize they need to redesign the horse to get rid of
00:27:39 or something, which is unfortunate because we used her for a drawcast episode recently,
00:27:43 but I just put a trash bag on her head, literally. Yeah. There we go. That work. I'm gonna give her
00:27:47 just like a generic Alma helmet or something to make it look funny. I don't know.
00:27:51 Whatever. Speaking of, speaking of the drawcast, I, I, uh, how many more people does the, uh,
00:27:58 does the, uh, the, the telephone episode have to go through?
00:28:02 Not that many people. We've just had a couple of people who just sat in it for weeks.
00:28:09 Yeah. Yeah. When did it start? I can't remember.
00:28:13 It's 12 months ago. Probably four months ago.
00:28:21 Maybe five. I just, uh, I don't know. Look, look, look at forward to that. I guess the list must
00:28:27 have grown because when I looked at the list, there weren't that many more people. There's like
00:28:31 20 people on the list, which is pretty long for a telephone, but I think that'll make it way
00:28:35 better when it's done. Cause the character will have evolved a lot more, I assume. I haven't seen
00:28:42 any of you yet. I can't look at it because I'm still waiting for my spot. I haven't looked at it
00:28:49 in a while. I looked at it. I looked at what was done after I did mine. I had assumed it was like
00:28:57 canceled because I hadn't seen it be updated for so long. I was like, are you, are you in that
00:29:01 Simsie? Yes, I think so. Oh, sick. Yeah, I had been waiting for a while. I had kind of been like,
00:29:08 that must be canceled if it's been this long. Okay. Well, that's good.
00:29:13 You got to hound people who love you and fool. You got to hound them. You got to say,
00:29:17 get this shit done like all my commissioners did. And I finally, I had commissions from
00:29:22 fucking four months ago that I hadn't done. I am the worst at this shit. I should not do it as a
00:29:27 shit, dude. That's pretty bad. That's pretty bad. It's like my record.
00:29:33 Jesus Christ. What was that though? Was that like a full vector model?
00:29:38 Well, yeah, that was one of those vector packs. Well, here's the thing, the vector packs,
00:29:41 most of the time I can do them in like a single day. The problem is it was really hard for me
00:29:46 to keep on top of them with pencilmation. I was always behind on things and those things had like
00:29:51 strict deadlines that like had to be done and everything was always like down for the wire.
00:29:56 And it was like that for like a couple years at a certain point. This is very hard for me to
00:30:01 actually make progress on my commissions. Now that I am not working at pencilmation anymore,
00:30:06 I can, what I'll do is I won't accept batches of commissions anymore. I'll accept one commission
00:30:12 at a time and I'll do it that day. And then I'll accept another one and do it that day.
00:30:16 That's what I decided on. So no one waits. The way I'm doing it going forward is if I'm in the mood
00:30:21 to do a commission, I think I can do one. I will put up on Twitter. Hey, I'm going to do a commission.
00:30:27 I'm not having multiple slots open because it will just get past me. And I know how my brain
00:30:32 works and it doesn't work properly. Speaking of, this reminds me of the most annoying comment
00:30:42 ever got on the last episode. I'm going to complain about this one commenter.
00:30:47 This one made me feel like I was losing my mind because this is like, I anticipated,
00:30:56 I imagined someone complaining that like me talking about the artist, you know,
00:31:02 bailing on the dojin and ghosting me. I imagined someone finding it objectionable
00:31:09 that I would complain about that. And then I was like, no, Ben, you're being ridiculous.
00:31:13 It's just so foolish. Well, some commenter was like, Ben, you're bullying this guy.
00:31:22 It's evil. It's cruel. You're a monster. It's not really true, I'm paraphrasing,
00:31:29 but someone was complaining that like, this guy thinks it's wrong. This guy thinks it's wrong
00:31:33 for me to complain about the guy who basically like scam. I didn't even do like a full scam.
00:31:39 It wasn't like a deliberate scam, but he did like, he took, he took money for a service and
00:31:43 he didn't deliver on the service and then he, then he ghosted. And I, I just can't believe this
00:31:49 guy thinks I'm the bad guy for just for saying that, for saying that that happened. Fuck you,
00:31:56 commenter. It's the ghosting part that makes it like, like a bad thing that you can complain about.
00:32:04 Because like if somebody is saying, oh, I'm taking a while, at least they're in contact with you.
00:32:09 Yeah, absolutely. And you can talk to them about it. You can, you can, you can like arrange
00:32:12 something and you don't have to say anything publicly because you're talking to them.
00:32:16 This fucking pussy. But if you have no way to, to talk to them, what are you gonna do?
00:32:20 This pussy, this pussy commenter was like, oh, you're probably just making them anxious. You're
00:32:25 probably giving them anxiety. Fuck you. Fuck you. We live in a society. I don't care. It's your
00:32:31 problem. When you do, you're, I guess we shouldn't, I guess we shouldn't have trials for criminal.
00:32:36 I guess when people do crimes, we probably shouldn't have trials for them because that would
00:32:40 be bullying them and it would probably give them anxiety. They'd probably be like, bothered by
00:32:44 that. You fucking, this sick fuck, sick fucking mentality this guy has. I hate it. I hate it.
00:32:52 Yeah, with my incredibly late stuff, at least like tried to contact and say, hey, sorry,
00:32:56 I haven't been able to work on it. Or when I went back to do those, I would not have been mad at
00:33:01 all. I would not have even been mad if the guy had been like, sorry, I'm three months late.
00:33:05 I'm working on it. I'd be like, you know what? No big deal. You know what? These things happen.
00:33:09 Three months is the cutoff point. Wouldn't even, wouldn't even about it.
00:33:11 Where I offered like a refund or the, or to just do it and then say, sorry. You know what I mean?
00:33:17 Yeah. Like half the people who's commissions were really late recently. I offered them refunds and
00:33:22 half of them took them. So it just seems fair. I mean, I'm not saying like that guy should give
00:33:27 you a refund, but he should give you a refund. He should give me, he should refund me at least
00:33:32 part of it because he didn't do, right. Cause I paid him half and he didn't quite do half.
00:33:36 He probably did like a third. So is that going to be used anywhere? What's been done?
00:33:43 Yeah. Yeah. I think I'm going to keep what's done. And, and, uh, uh, yeah, I'm going to keep what he
00:33:50 did. And, uh, Kaiju is just going to just do the rest. Yeah. The, the dodging is like a few like
00:33:57 short stories, isn't it? Yeah. So they can be like different art styles and not be too jarring.
00:34:05 Yeah. Yeah. I don't think he, I don't think he like finished. I think he did quit mid story.
00:34:13 So one story will be split. I don't, you know, I mean, not that they, they look the same,
00:34:19 but I feel like Kaiju and this guy have close enough style. They, they both do, you know,
00:34:25 sort of manga style, like, you know, black on white, uh, uh, line art, kind of sort of a
00:34:31 traditional manga look. It's not exactly the same, but I feel like they are, they are compatible
00:34:37 enough in a way that it's not like going to be a weird, like doesn't, doesn't look like the same
00:34:42 comic. Uh, I don't know, whatever. It'll just be a funny, like, oh, huh. This, this page was by,
00:34:47 you can see, you can tell when the art is shifted because the art style changes a little bit here
00:34:51 and here. Yeah. Yeah. Like, uh, when that voice actor from Avis Alastair Vendor died and they
00:34:56 got another white boy guy and it sounded like exactly the same and you can only barely tell.
00:35:01 Which, which, um, that's Iro. Iro, um, was voiced by Mako, I think. Yeah. I don't know.
00:35:11 Yeah. So it's sort of a, he was like a prestigious Japanese like actor who worked in a lot of stuff
00:35:17 and, um, very old guy, sort of had a, like a, like a, like, oh, voice.
00:35:22 But you mean in the English stuff? You mean in the, you mean the original?
00:35:27 So I was going to say, I didn't say it. I was, I meant the, but you, but you mean the English
00:35:32 voice actors? Yeah. Yeah. I didn't, I didn't know that. Okay. I never noticed the voice change. So
00:35:41 I mean, on the first watch, I didn't, but I think I've definitely noticed it every time
00:35:46 since the first watch. So I'm like, oh, that's when. If I ever watched it again, I'm sure I'd
00:35:51 be listening for it. Yeah. Uh, yeah. Oh, well, maybe I'm just kind of deaf.
00:35:59 I'm pretty, I'm pretty bad at noticing and noticing things like that. I have a tall,
00:36:04 kind of good, kind of like one of the best. Yeah. That's what they say. That's what they tell me.
00:36:10 Is it as good as they say though? Yes. Pretty much. Yes.
00:36:14 As far as the last airbender is really that good. Dude.
00:36:18 YouTube thumbnail, red text. Distilled critic watched every episode with his brother and they
00:36:23 talked about it and he said, show good. Hmm. I agree. Thumb up. I'm not sure if it's good.
00:36:32 I have a bunch of, um, I have a bunch of gripes. I have a bunch of life gripes that are bugging me.
00:36:42 I'm just going to go, I'm just going to go down. Hashtag Ben Sains life gripes.
00:36:46 Here we go. Top number 10. I'm just going to go down a list and list off things that annoy me.
00:36:51 The life grapes and the wine corner. You turn gripes into wines.
00:36:59 Yeah. Yeah. This is the wine corner and these are all the individual grapes that I'm about to smush.
00:37:05 Number one. My glasses broke, uh, sort of. I dropped them a little while ago and one of the
00:37:11 frames cracked and it's just a small crack in the side of the, of the, one of the, the frames and
00:37:19 the lens is fine. Like the lens didn't crack, but now like there's a little gap and I,
00:37:23 if I move my head a lot or like I, I, I, I hold them the wrong way, the lens will fall out.
00:37:29 So I need to like glue the frames. I should get new lens, new frames because I got these
00:37:33 like eight fucking years ago. Oh, let's try and come up with solutions for all of Ben's life
00:37:38 gripes. Uh, number one, get new frames or tape. Uh, uh, I, I'm going to order some gorilla glue.
00:37:46 I'm going to order some gorilla glue, but I, it's only like $6. So I had to buy some other stuff
00:37:52 to get free shipping on Amazon. So I'm waiting for it. Like I said, if I sell like two more
00:37:57 copies of the Blu-ray, I will have to buy more discs. So I'm waiting until like two more Blu-ray
00:38:03 copies sell so that I can order another batch of discs, which will get me over the $25 limit
00:38:09 to pay no shipping on an Amazon order. So so I get my gorilla glue free shipping charges.
00:38:15 You see, it's all, it's all connected. Would you like glue your glasses with like a glue gun
00:38:21 pointed towards, uh, like while you're wearing them, just right into your eye?
00:38:26 Cassie said they had a glue gun that I, I was going to, I was going to glue gun them
00:38:33 temporarily together, but I just forgot to, uh, and now I don't want to walk over there
00:38:38 because it's too cold out and there's too much snow. So I'm just, I'm just fucked.
00:38:42 All right, life gripe number two. Let's go. Let's go. Uh, my toilet is clogged.
00:38:47 Plunger, Amazon, uh, put you over the limit for the things.
00:38:50 I have to buy a new toilet.
00:38:52 Dude, you mentioned my plunger.
00:38:53 Destroy it. Plunger.
00:38:55 Dude, plunger, plungers are so cool.
00:38:56 When I was a kid, I loved when I run into the store and I would grab a bunch of plungers and
00:39:00 stick them to the walls. I have, I have been, I have a plunger and I have tried to plunge it
00:39:06 and it doesn't work. Okay. This, since I moved in, this, this toilet, this toilet in my apartment
00:39:15 is, I guess it sucks because it clogs quite often. It has clogged a bunch of times. However,
00:39:20 if, if I just like have like, let it, if I just have ignored it, because there's two
00:39:24 toilets in my apartment, I can just use the upstairs toilet, right? I can just, if I have
00:39:27 just let it sit for a day or two, eventually the clog like dissolves or whatever. And it,
00:39:32 and it has like cleared up and it's like fine. This time it has been clogged for like a week.
00:39:36 It has in fact only gotten worse. The clog has only gotten more severe. I don't know what's up with
00:39:41 that. Um, but so, and plunging has not fixed it. So God, I might actually have to like call my
00:39:47 superintendent or my landlord or something and be like, uh, fix it. Or I guess I could just go buy
00:39:53 some like Drano or something. I've never, I've never like, gotta get that, that like duct, toilet,
00:39:58 blast pipe, chemical dissolving, get like an air cannon and fire it into the toilet.
00:40:06 So I mean, whatever, I just been using the upstairs toilet. Like it doesn't even matter,
00:40:10 but it just makes me annoyed. It just makes me feel like I live in a, in a dump, which I do live
00:40:14 in a dump. So I guess that's fine. Uh, third problem is I don't have a, uh, uh, I don't have a,
00:40:22 I miss, I need another blanket. It's too cold. I need a third blanket. I have another blanket,
00:40:27 but it like, I think I spilled something on it like a while ago and I've been meaning to do my
00:40:31 laundry. I've been meaning to put it in the laundry, but it requires like a load unto itself
00:40:36 because it's a big blanket and I just don't want to put you over the limit of the spending thing.
00:40:40 And I just don't want to spay the $2. I don't want to pay the $2 to do a whole load of fucking
00:40:45 laundry just for one, actually $4 because I have to dry it afterwards. So I've just been,
00:40:50 so whatever, I just have a bathrobe. I just put it, I just put a bathrobe on top of my bed and
00:40:54 now that's my third blanket. Watch your fucking clothes Ben. Jesus. I don't, it's, it would take
00:41:00 a whole separate load just for the, just for a blanket. I don't want to. You can put some socks
00:41:04 and pants in there with it. No, it's too big. Oh, fuck you. And I don't, you're telling, oh,
00:41:11 what am I, what am I going to do, Simsie? Just, just lift myself, pick myself up
00:41:15 in my bootstraps and spend the $4 to do a whole load of laundry. Yes. Don't be ridiculous.
00:41:23 Self-care is important, my friend. I was thinking of like getting a blanket and buying like a brooch
00:41:31 and making a cloak because like, because that's basically what a cloak is. It's just like a long
00:41:38 big piece of cloth that you wrap around yourself. That's a problem with walking around your house
00:41:41 dressed like that. Well, not just like outside, like, but the only problem is like,
00:41:46 it's getting warmer, it's going to be spring and it'll be very weird to have a like cloak.
00:41:51 It's good for like when it's really cold. I mean, why not? And you can like wrap it around and it's
00:41:56 like, it's like a fashion thing that is completely gone for no reason. They're trying to sell you
00:42:03 coats. Coats aren't as cool. It's a, coats are a racket. Coats are a new agenda. Coats are a jacket.
00:42:09 They make fucking people. They, they, they sell, they sell us poison and then they suppress our
00:42:15 cures. Well, no, they, and they, to sell us cures while we suppress our medicine. Selling,
00:42:21 give us poison is cold. Sell us cures is coats. Suppress our medicine is cloaks clasped with a
00:42:29 brooch. Anyway, it's just, it's just such a, such a base cloak life, a base and easy solution.
00:42:36 All I need is a brooch. I don't know where to get one. I guess I can Amazon or look around.
00:42:42 A brooch is just like a pin, right? Like a pin in the class.
00:42:45 A big, a big hefty pin that you can go through and can withstand pulling forces of a big,
00:42:52 heavy blanket. Big, heavy person pulling it real hard. Yeah, like give. Yeah. Yeah. Give you like
00:43:02 400 pounds, right? I cost a lot more than that. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Life grapes go. We
00:43:13 need another one. Yeah. I had one, one more, which is a dental insurance. I've been trying
00:43:18 to look into dental insurance and like it doesn't make any sense and it sucks so much and it doesn't
00:43:23 even work. Like it doesn't, it doesn't, it's not even good. It doesn't even like actually pay for
00:43:29 shit. Amazon.com, cheap dental insurance. Amazon Prime Dental, the new services they're rolling
00:43:38 it up. Because I got, because I got to go to the dentist because I'm sure I need a couple of
00:43:41 fillings at least. And so I'm like, okay, time to actually do that. So I tried to do it. I tried
00:43:47 to like be good and get my shit taken care of and I went and I tried to look into it. And I guess
00:43:52 the most popular dental insurance in Massachusetts is something called Delta Dental, but everyone
00:43:56 hates it and apparently it sucks. And I was looking at their policies and like you could get,
00:44:01 they'll give you, they'll give you like, they won't even pay for shit. They'll give you like 50%
00:44:05 off at best. That's the best, that's the best you can get for, for, yeah. It's 30% on some things.
00:44:15 And then like, I don't know, like they're, I was looking at their plans and then they have like a
00:44:19 regular plan. It's like, oh yeah, this is a plan that like, if you have this plan, you'll have no
00:44:22 waiting period. It'll cover all this stuff. It's not available anymore. That one's, you just can't
00:44:27 get that one anymore. I'm like, okay, cool. So I don't know. It's just, it's so like inscrutable
00:44:35 and like they don't even tell you what a plan costs. They don't list the price anywhere. They just
00:44:41 will say, yeah, this plan exists and this is what it covers. What does it cost? I don't know.
00:44:50 Depends on how big your teeth are. Don't even worry about it. Well, how am I supposed to
00:44:54 fucking choose a plan? You freaks. You sick fucks.
00:45:02 I called my, called my parents and I asked my dad like, what should I do? And I forgot like, well,
00:45:09 they have like Medicare. So like, they don't have to worry about this shit. Okay, great.
00:45:15 My dad, because my dad gets all of us kids, my dad gets all of us offspring, a AAA membership.
00:45:25 Every year. So he recommended that I get some insurance offered through AAA. There are some,
00:45:31 there are some companies that are like, affiliated with AAA. I was like, okay.
00:45:36 So I was going to look through those, but like, I didn't because it's like,
00:45:41 they have names like choosy, like they sound like fucking apps.
00:45:46 Jeez.
00:45:47 That's horrifying.
00:45:47 They sound like fucking Twitter artists.
00:45:50 C-H-E-W-S-I. I don't know, man. That sounds weird for an insurance company.
00:45:55 Choosy Manfredo.
00:45:58 Yeah. So, so, uh, I just, just, um, I don't know. I haven't done it.
00:46:05 That's a life gripe that you've got to solve on your own, my friend.
00:46:09 Yeah. I'm afraid Amazon free shipping isn't going to solve this one for me.
00:46:14 As it does so many things.
00:46:17 Yeah. So that was it. That's the end of my, uh, that's everything on my list of stuff that's
00:46:23 bugging me.
00:46:23 That will be a recurring segment every week where we go through all the little things that
00:46:27 have ruined Ben's existence and life.
00:46:28 I mean, I mean, it pretty much is already. It's just we've never put a name to it.
00:46:34 We need a jingle for it.
00:46:36 Ben's life gripes.
00:46:37 I think, is it, I'm going to get that guy, I'm going to find that guy's name.
00:46:43 Came to make a life gripes jingle.
00:46:46 Oh, yeah, please. Somebody has to do it.
00:46:51 Genius.
00:46:52 That's all I got. That's all I got.
00:46:55 And we're only 45 minutes in.
00:46:59 Um, well, I guess I can talk a little bit about maps. I said last time.
00:47:07 Mutu Sandu. Mutu Sandu is the guy in the comments. He's the guy who does the music.
00:47:12 And I think he's probably the guy in Japan that you got to ship to, perhaps, perhaps, maybe.
00:47:18 He's a real Tokyo boy. He's got a Tokyo address. He gave me his, his shipping address to send
00:47:23 them some stuff, but he gave it to me like in like fucking kanji.
00:47:29 I'm like, what the, what the fuck am I supposed to do with this?
00:47:32 Oh, speaking of Japan, I got my first, he gave it to me in English too.
00:47:35 I got my first embarrassing sexy one piece figure.
00:47:38 Hooray.
00:47:39 Hooray.
00:47:40 When it arrived at the house, my dad looked at the package and he was like, Fukuoka City.
00:47:44 What the hell's that? I was like, never mind.
00:47:48 I want to see you, Simsie.
00:47:49 Uh, it's on my Twitter. It's not.
00:47:51 Is it Robin?
00:47:52 Yeah, it's Robin. Of course it's Robin. What the fuck do you think I am? So I'm going to plebeian?
00:47:57 Or I'm going to buy a fucking.
00:47:58 Like Batman and Robin?
00:48:00 Yeah. From one piece.
00:48:03 From one piece.
00:48:03 He's got his, he's got his like little short, short.
00:48:05 Hang on.
00:48:05 But out.
00:48:06 Here's a picture.
00:48:07 I bought it with leftover Amazon money that I had from.
00:48:11 That's not embarrassing.
00:48:13 No, but it's like, fuck yeah, there it is.
00:48:15 Dude, I didn't know she was that much taller than Bulma.
00:48:17 What the fuck?
00:48:18 I know. I was very surprised.
00:48:20 It's the same brand as well. It's Canon. That's the Canon height.
00:48:24 Wow, she's tiny.
00:48:25 Yeah.
00:48:27 Oh, I like it.
00:48:29 Oh, I found her. I found her.
00:48:31 And I immediately bought another one because I was like, that's cool.
00:48:33 I want to know. I need an Ami now.
00:48:37 These sorts of figures are like cool as a photograph.
00:48:44 When I see them in, in like real life,
00:48:48 like the time I went to Digi's or Trixie's older house
00:48:52 for Redcon one and two and stuff.
00:48:55 I saw all those figurines and I was like, oh, that's what they look like
00:48:59 in person because I'd never bought one.
00:49:01 And they're like, this just annoys me because of like,
00:49:06 it not not because of what it is.
00:49:08 I don't care about anime or whatever or like whatever it is.
00:49:11 Like, oh, it's it's embarrassing. It's not. It's just a figure.
00:49:14 But like, yeah, having figures that with with like, oh, you got to dust them.
00:49:20 You got to put the fine shelf space for them.
00:49:23 Yeah.
00:49:23 I'm like, that's a whole that's like a full time job is keeping a display looking nice.
00:49:28 I do hate owning things.
00:49:30 I do hate owning things.
00:49:31 Just minimize ownership and everything's fine.
00:49:35 Yeah.
00:49:36 Well, that's that's the attitude that got me in a fucking shithole apartment
00:49:40 with a clogged toilet and so, you know, who's who's not enough.
00:49:46 I have I have a plunger.
00:49:48 I have a plunger.
00:49:49 I guess I need to plunger.
00:49:51 I need to do one.
00:49:52 You got to you got to you got to do a dual system.
00:49:55 Yes, that's the phrase I was looking for.
00:49:58 You're using the right bed.
00:49:59 You're not sticking a thin bit down the toilet.
00:50:01 Oh, it's just just jam the.
00:50:03 Well, yeah, you jam the wooden end down.
00:50:05 You just wash it around to try and break up the clog.
00:50:07 Right.
00:50:08 Right.
00:50:10 Yeah.
00:50:11 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:50:11 Well, well, it doesn't fucking work.
00:50:14 So what you fix a clog door is you keep flushing it until the water comes out.
00:50:17 And then it's done.
00:50:18 And it's everything's fine.
00:50:20 It used to work.
00:50:21 It used to just it used to just unclog itself.
00:50:24 But not anymore.
00:50:25 Now, well, not that not this time.
00:50:28 Yeah, I like toys.
00:50:29 I like buying embarrassing toys to have my desk and it makes me smile.
00:50:33 That's all I wanted to say, really.
00:50:36 I have like more like a collection of of plush toys instead.
00:50:41 And those at least you can squish together and like and throw on the bed or on the floor.
00:50:45 Yeah, you can have the you can have convenient storage of plushies.
00:50:49 Yeah, you don't have to worry about all that fell off the shelf.
00:50:52 Yeah.
00:50:53 Oh, or or anything.
00:50:54 Because along the top shelf.
00:50:56 Along the top shelf, which is next to me.
00:50:58 Yeah.
00:50:59 Along the top of the bookshelf, which is next to my desk,
00:51:01 I've got all my like Gundam models and action figures and shit set up
00:51:04 because I'm an embarrassing 22 year old fucking freak.
00:51:07 But I own I own nothing.
00:51:13 I own nothing.
00:51:14 You own you have digital ownership of things, but it's fine.
00:51:20 I have a little my friend.
00:51:22 My friend Chelsea gave me a little a little Homer Simpson Buddha,
00:51:27 who's like holding a donut.
00:51:29 That's the right kind of thing to own a little a little.
00:51:32 I'm not I'm not sure if it's plastic or rubber,
00:51:35 but it's a little a little figurine of a little Buddha Homer Simpson.
00:51:39 And that's that's my Nika Robin.
00:51:43 You look at him longingly every day.
00:51:46 And that's culturally insensitive to someone, probably.
00:51:50 He's up on my he's up on my shelf next to my Sonic the Hedgehog and Shrek glasses.
00:51:56 Very nice.
00:51:57 I collect collectible glasses.
00:51:58 Shrek glasses.
00:51:59 Do they have I have do they give you a little Shrek here?
00:52:02 Let me put them on.
00:52:03 They just have a little screened on.
00:52:04 They're like promotional glasses from like Shrek three, I think.
00:52:08 Oh, the one with the best one.
00:52:10 You mean the one with the babies.
00:52:11 You mean drinking glass or eyeglass is they're not shot not shot glasses.
00:52:17 They're just I don't know what you call them.
00:52:20 Tumblers.
00:52:21 Tumbler glasses.
00:52:22 They're you know, they're like not like tall glasses.
00:52:25 They're like, you know, medium height glasses of normal width.
00:52:30 Yeah.
00:52:31 Chugging down your Shrek flavor, Jack Daniels.
00:52:34 Yeah.
00:52:37 Shrek coming green green.
00:52:40 Yeah.
00:52:40 Green St. Patrick's Day Shrek themed whiskey.
00:52:46 They do green versions of basically every food like I know around Halloween,
00:52:49 Jaffa cakes, they do like green versions of those and I've always been scared to try them
00:52:53 because I don't know why we don't have we don't have Jaffa cakes over here.
00:52:58 But I mean, they do green.
00:53:00 They do green beer.
00:53:02 Yeah, they do some green.
00:53:03 I've never had green beer.
00:53:05 That sounds terrible.
00:53:06 That might be that might be a thing that they just do like at bars.
00:53:09 Like how do you tell it's green because you're drinking it, you know, looking at it.
00:53:14 I don't know if they sell like I don't know if they if many brands like sell green beer
00:53:21 like in bottles.
00:53:22 No, of course not.
00:53:24 It's funny.
00:53:24 I used to think beer was green because they were in the glass bottles.
00:53:29 I didn't really put it together that it's not that color.
00:53:32 Yeah.
00:53:34 This is like way before I started drinking.
00:53:36 There's just like, oh, I see that beer bottles are green or wine bottles are like a weird color.
00:53:42 Yeah.
00:53:42 I think my parents drank like mostly like clear bowl stuff all the time.
00:53:46 And then they straight vodka.
00:53:48 Yeah.
00:53:50 Yeah.
00:53:50 I was like, that's cool.
00:53:51 That footage just makes you act real strange.
00:53:55 My dad, one time at Olive Garden, my dad gave me a sip of his firewater whiskey.
00:54:02 And when I was like a kid and I was like, oh god, he like laughed.
00:54:06 He thought it was funny that I was like, disgusted by it.
00:54:09 Honestly, it probably was funny.
00:54:11 Honestly, I think I get it.
00:54:13 Yeah.
00:54:13 That happened with me, but with like a normal beer.
00:54:16 Like, you know that warm throat feeling you get from alcohol?
00:54:19 Like too much of it.
00:54:19 Yeah.
00:54:20 I had that.
00:54:21 I had like a sip of my dad's desperado.
00:54:23 So when I was like eight and I was like, my throat's burnt.
00:54:26 It's on fire.
00:54:27 What's going on?
00:54:29 I smell.
00:54:30 I smelled beer as a kid and I thought it smelled because I would because we would have
00:54:36 to like sort our recycling into, you know, you know, returnables and non-returnables.
00:54:43 And then, you know, my parents would let, we, okay, we didn't have like, like trash pickup.
00:54:47 We had to take our trash to the dump and we would sort recyclables and we could bring
00:54:53 the recyclables to a local, to a liquor store, actually, or to a returnery or whatever you
00:54:59 call it.
00:55:00 And they would accept, you know, cans and they would give you return money for it.
00:55:04 A nickel per can or whatever.
00:55:06 And so parents, when we were little kids, parents would let us sort it and then we
00:55:10 could take it and return it and we could get the return money.
00:55:13 And, you know, I would do that and I would sort out my dad's beer cans and I'd be like,
00:55:17 oh, this is gross.
00:55:18 It's so fucking disgusting.
00:55:19 It smells nasty.
00:55:21 So I never wanted to try tasting beer as a kid.
00:55:25 I thought it was the grossest shit ever.
00:55:28 And I was right.
00:55:28 You were correct.
00:55:29 I should go, I should go back.
00:55:31 I should go back to that.
00:55:33 Yeah.
00:55:33 If only it was possible.
00:55:35 My dad, my dad, by which I mean my bare father, who's a piece of shit.
00:55:40 Let me try beer and it was fucking gross.
00:55:43 It was the worst shit.
00:55:45 And later, like over a decade later, I got my first job and the boss from America
00:55:53 randomly showed up at our tiny office.
00:55:55 He just walked in unannounced to check up on me.
00:55:59 Was this in New Zealand?
00:56:00 Yeah, it was in New Zealand.
00:56:01 He puts a beer on my desk.
00:56:03 It was like, yeah, I bought you this.
00:56:05 Haha.
00:56:05 It's brand is really good.
00:56:07 And I'm like, oh, thank you.
00:56:10 I don't really drink alcohol, but sure.
00:56:12 I'll give it a try.
00:56:13 And I tried it when I got home and it was not good.
00:56:17 Yeah.
00:56:19 Do you still not like beer?
00:56:21 Well, that was only a few years ago.
00:56:23 Most alcohol I don't like the taste of.
00:56:27 Well, sure.
00:56:28 The alcohol itself is just kind of nasty.
00:56:33 And there's only been a couple where the flavor has been good enough to
00:56:38 mask it or work with it.
00:56:40 Like I like Baileys.
00:56:44 That's why mixed drinks exist.
00:56:46 The point of them is that you mixed stuff together so you don't taste the alcohol.
00:56:52 I think there was a few beers I've liked.
00:56:55 I like Hobgoblin, which is like a.
00:56:58 That's funny.
00:56:59 I've never heard of that.
00:57:00 It's like, I don't know what it is, like ale or pale ale or whatever.
00:57:05 It's a beer.
00:57:05 It's got a hobgoblin on the front, like a fancy creature.
00:57:09 Let me see.
00:57:09 Those taste all right.
00:57:11 I think it's a gold beer.
00:57:12 I remember really liking, yeah, I remember really liking this Icelandic beer
00:57:20 because it was like a lot of beer is quite bitter and like
00:57:26 yeasty or fermenty flavor.
00:57:29 And it's like whatever who cares.
00:57:31 But this was sort of sweet and smooth, but not super strong either.
00:57:35 It was it was really good.
00:57:37 And I don't know what it was called.
00:57:39 One time at in Atlanta with econ, I went to we went a couple times to this ramen restaurant.
00:57:48 And this place had a couple of Japanese beers and one beer that they had was this.
00:57:54 I guess it was sort of a novelty beer.
00:57:56 It was blue, but like it was light blue was pale like sky blue.
00:58:01 The beat the liquid was and it was supposed it was supposedly like
00:58:05 supposedly it was like it was naturally that color.
00:58:07 Like it was brewed with like glacier water or something.
00:58:11 And it was like, I don't think it was died.
00:58:15 And it was really good.
00:58:16 I really liked it.
00:58:16 It was very light and a little bit sweet.
00:58:18 And I was like, this is great.
00:58:19 It was like it was like 12 fucking dollars a bottle though.
00:58:23 So, you know, that's the way.
00:58:26 But it was neat.
00:58:26 I'm not sorry.
00:58:27 I tried it.
00:58:29 I like I like sours.
00:58:31 I like I like beers that are like.
00:58:34 Yeah, that are not that are very.
00:58:36 I mean, I don't exactly know what a sour is like how it's made.
00:58:39 But it's it's very like light and it's not very hoppy and it's very tart.
00:58:43 And sometimes it has a fruity taste.
00:58:45 I like sours a lot other than I like I don't really like dark beers.
00:58:50 I don't really like loggers.
00:58:51 I kind of just like drinking like some fucking like Miller light,
00:58:56 like piss water bullshit, because it's like whatever.
00:58:59 It's basically just water.
00:59:01 Ah, what we.
00:59:01 Like I barely even taste.
00:59:04 I mean, it's a good word for it.
00:59:06 Oh, because it's because it's just like drinking water.
00:59:08 You barely even taste it.
00:59:09 It's like fuck it.
00:59:10 Yeah.
00:59:11 Yes.
00:59:12 It was Einstok Icelandic pale ale.
00:59:15 I like that one.
00:59:17 And the hobgoblin is a dark English ale.
00:59:19 Yeah.
00:59:19 I guess I like ales.
00:59:21 Ales are good.
00:59:22 Have you ever had doomba?
00:59:23 Doomba is pretty good.
00:59:24 Corned.
00:59:24 Doomba is very good.
00:59:25 I love.
00:59:26 Well, I wouldn't say very good.
00:59:28 Most beer is like that's that's all right.
00:59:32 And hobgoblin and Icelandic pale ale go a little further.
00:59:38 I think they're not like my favorite thing to drink.
00:59:40 I'm just like if I'm in the mood to get drunk, I'd rather be this.
00:59:44 I think it's the seeds of the bloke in me that has come out in the last few years.
00:59:50 I just I just love the.
00:59:51 Seeds of the bloke.
00:59:53 There are aspects to my personality and the things that I like that I'm like,
00:59:56 oh fuck, I'm kind of am like a typical English fat guy bloke sometimes.
01:00:03 Dude, I take one drink of ale and I am king in the north.
01:00:07 I am Jon Snow.
01:00:09 I am all of that.
01:00:10 I'm glued to the footy.
01:00:11 I'm arguing about the rugby.
01:00:13 I'm kicking the cricket ball right in my son's head.
01:00:15 I'm doing all the stuff.
01:00:17 Hmm.
01:00:18 Well, I mean, you just lean into it, I guess.
01:00:21 I guess I could do.
01:00:22 You're going to be you're going to be wearing like an like a newsy cap and.
01:00:27 But what's what's a bloke?
01:00:28 What's a blokely thing to do?
01:00:31 Opening a newspaper to look at the boobies on page three.
01:00:35 Getting a tattoo of your favorite football team on your shoulder.
01:00:38 And then you're you're then you get really fat.
01:00:40 So the tattoo gets stretched out and it looks really terrible.
01:00:43 Seen that before.
01:00:45 That's pretty good.
01:00:46 It's a it's a it's a tradition.
01:00:47 It's a tradition.
01:00:48 It runs in the family.
01:00:49 Alcohol, cigarettes.
01:00:51 It's all garbage.
01:00:52 It's all shit.
01:00:53 It all tastes like crap.
01:00:54 It all smells terrible.
01:00:55 Just to have sex.
01:00:57 That's the only thing.
01:00:58 Just have sex.
01:00:59 Just just have sex, a virgin.
01:01:01 Yeah.
01:01:02 Especially to get a beer though.
01:01:07 You can only have one.
01:01:08 If you can't get it, draw it.
01:01:12 That's mine.
01:01:12 That's mine.
01:01:13 If you get drunk enough.
01:01:14 Draws beer.
01:01:17 Just damn.
01:01:18 Damn, I'm thirsty.
01:01:21 Draws a draw.
01:01:22 Draws a pint.
01:01:22 Beer or booba.
01:01:25 You could only draw one.
01:01:27 The answer is clear.
01:01:29 And it's not beer.
01:01:34 I'm slave to your edges, oblivion, full of your slight.
01:01:37 Most most most like guys, a lot of guys that I know and I'm friends with are very
01:01:44 they're very like into beer.
01:01:46 They're like they like they like to buy like micro brews and like oh locally brewed like oh
01:01:52 an IPA or like a pale stout or whatever.
01:01:55 It's like you know buying a fancy whatever.
01:01:59 Pick a new brand every week and it's and I'm like that's fine.
01:02:03 That's cool and all.
01:02:04 I like trying new things as much as the next guy.
01:02:07 But at the end of the day most of these most like of those beers are like they're strong.
01:02:11 They're like they're brewed to have a strong flavor.
01:02:13 Yeah.
01:02:14 And I'm like I don't kind of I kind of don't like the flavor.
01:02:17 I don't really drink it for the flavor like it's fine.
01:02:19 Like I kind of get how you can kind of enjoy like you sip like a dark lager
01:02:24 again or whatever and you're like ready.
01:02:27 It's like it's fine.
01:02:29 But like I kind of don't really care about that.
01:02:32 So you know just the piss water.
01:02:34 Piss water is fine.
01:02:35 And it's like a dollar fifty you can.
01:02:37 So who's the who's the real genius.
01:02:40 Who's the real real beer official.
01:02:42 I've only ever dipped into like fancy beers like once.
01:02:44 And it was when me and my friends went to a micro brewery in Lincoln.
01:02:48 And we had like a chocolate hazelnut stout.
01:02:51 And it was so fucking fulfilling.
01:02:54 It was like jam packed with fucking stomach space.
01:02:57 It feels like a couple years ago.
01:03:01 This was right when I moved back from Atlanta.
01:03:03 I moved back into my old place monkey house as we called it.
01:03:06 And I think like shortly after that I guess I wasn't invited.
01:03:09 Because I guess they had I guess they had had to schedule this in advance.
01:03:13 And I had not been back at the time.
01:03:15 So I couldn't go.
01:03:16 But a bunch of those guys went for one of their birthdays.
01:03:19 They went to some brewery.
01:03:20 And as part of this brewery trip they got to like.
01:03:24 They got to like mix their own a batch of their own beer or whatever.
01:03:29 Like they mixed it in like a keg or something.
01:03:32 And they you know then like later they would bottle this entire batch.
01:03:36 And they gave them like the whole batch and bottle.
01:03:38 So this guy got like yeah he got like like several dozen bottles of some like beer
01:03:43 that he had like technically brewed himself or whatever.
01:03:46 And I never tried it.
01:03:47 I never got to try it.
01:03:48 That's a cool gimmick.
01:03:49 It's a cool gimmick.
01:03:52 Wonder if it was good.
01:03:54 Yeah apparently brewed beer is actually really hard in terms of like stirring
01:03:58 it and shit.
01:03:59 So they might fuck that up and made some shitty beer.
01:04:01 I like to pretend that.
01:04:02 One one Christmas.
01:04:03 One Christmas I went to my uncle's house and my cousin was there.
01:04:09 And he and we didn't have anything to talk about.
01:04:11 So he kind of told me he was getting into like brewing his own beer or whatever.
01:04:14 I think he eventually like quit his his normie job and became like a.
01:04:19 He worked for some like micro brewery that he had like part ownership of or whatever.
01:04:25 They became a brew only.
01:04:27 They started a beer co-op or something like that.
01:04:31 And he showed me some of his like he showed me his like active.
01:04:37 I don't know what you call it.
01:04:38 He's like he showed me his active cultures.
01:04:40 He showed me some like tank that he was brewing in.
01:04:43 And like if you looked inside of it you could see that it was moving
01:04:46 because like the yeast inside was like alive and it was like swimming around in there fermenting.
01:04:51 And I was like weird man.
01:04:54 That's crazy man.
01:04:56 Seems cool I guess.
01:04:58 Yeah.
01:05:00 I don't know.
01:05:01 Not not a hobby I would probably pick up.
01:05:03 Yeah.
01:05:03 It's one of those things that's so like it's such a bad thing where like he gets.
01:05:07 Yeah it is.
01:05:08 He gets to like 60 and then he's not 60.
01:05:10 Like he gets like let's say 48.
01:05:13 I would say he's the perfect age for a dad to get really really into brewing.
01:05:17 And he clears out his garage and he puts fucking three vats in there.
01:05:21 It's like what are you doing?
01:05:22 It is a dadly thing.
01:05:26 I don't know.
01:05:27 I don't know.
01:05:29 You need a hobby I guess.
01:05:30 Yeah.
01:05:31 You do your thing.
01:05:32 Do your thing on the side.
01:05:33 Whatever if it's sparks joy in you.
01:05:36 Yeah.
01:05:37 More power to you.
01:05:38 It's you know it's equivalent to like making keto gummies.
01:05:43 It's just like what if I was in charge of what I consumed.
01:05:47 What if I was the means of production.
01:05:51 It probably yeah basically basically is.
01:05:54 And that's why I draw.
01:05:57 Yeah yeah.
01:05:59 Man sad again.
01:06:01 Sad again.
01:06:01 Crack found a link to a site that's that purported to offer isomaltoligosaccharides.
01:06:08 And it asked me to like enter my info and they would send me like a quote.
01:06:12 They would send me a quote for like how much will a certain quantity cost.
01:06:15 And I did it and they didn't send me anything.
01:06:18 I think the site is like is like soft to defunct.
01:06:21 It just doesn't work.
01:06:23 I was like damn it.
01:06:23 They were like this chump doesn't need enough
01:06:26 saccharide.
01:06:28 Maybe it maybe it was maybe like they saw the numbers I was asking for.
01:06:32 And they were just like this guy's not worth our time.
01:06:34 This guy's working in change.
01:06:35 We're dealing with this guy.
01:06:37 I'm sorry I only I'm sorry I only need like 10 to 20 pounds of the stuff.
01:06:43 I don't need like metric tons at a time.
01:06:46 Where would I even store it.
01:06:47 Where would I even store metric.
01:06:49 Wait.
01:06:49 I just thought of another gripe.
01:06:51 This is really important.
01:06:52 Can't get it's not a gripe.
01:06:55 No.
01:06:55 There's mice.
01:06:56 There's mice.
01:06:57 Oh no.
01:06:57 Mice in my kitchen.
01:06:59 Mice.
01:07:00 Ratatouille.
01:07:01 There were mice.
01:07:03 There were mice months ago.
01:07:04 I saw mice months ago and then I put down traps.
01:07:06 And I haven't seen any mice.
01:07:07 But then I was walking out my I was walking out my fucking bedroom door.
01:07:15 To my fucking clog toilet bathroom to not use it I guess.
01:07:19 And I heard and I heard a little rustling.
01:07:23 I heard something like twitch.
01:07:25 I heard a little paper bag rustling sound under the kitchen table.
01:07:29 Where we keep a bunch a bunch of people have bags of stuff.
01:07:32 And I went and I looked and I was like and I stopped and I listened.
01:07:36 And then I heard it again.
01:07:37 I heard a little rustle.
01:07:38 I heard a little rustle.
01:07:38 And I was like I think there's something.
01:07:40 I think there's something in one of these bags some creature.
01:07:43 So I like I walked towards it and I tried to like.
01:07:45 I wondered like what if I just picked up the bag that it's in.
01:07:49 And I just like threw it out into the parking lot.
01:07:51 Just throw the mice out of the house.
01:07:53 Right.
01:07:54 But I but I walked up towards it and as I got closer I stopped hearing it.
01:07:58 And then I couldn't I couldn't hear it anymore.
01:08:00 So I didn't know where it was.
01:08:01 And so I tried like I tried like nudging it.
01:08:03 I tried like kicking the little box that like the bags were in to try and see if I could make it move.
01:08:08 And I didn't hear anything.
01:08:09 And I was like and I was too scared.
01:08:11 I was too scared to like pick up the bag that I thought it was in.
01:08:15 Because I was like what if it like jumps out?
01:08:16 What if it like runs up my arms?
01:08:17 You're gonna fit five nights at Freddy's jump scares me right in the face.
01:08:19 Yeah.
01:08:20 Yeah.
01:08:20 So I couldn't do it.
01:08:22 I was like I'm just gonna I'm just gonna pretend I didn't hear anything.
01:08:25 I'm just gonna pretend it's not real.
01:08:26 And maybe it won't be.
01:08:28 But then why do I keep things under the table in bags?
01:08:34 You never keep like a bag of like rice or something?
01:08:38 I put it in a cupboard on the floor.
01:08:40 It's like asking for like little little creatures to come and get it.
01:08:44 Well, it's in like a rubber.
01:08:47 Yeah.
01:08:47 I mean in this I mean you're right.
01:08:49 And that's and that's what happened.
01:08:51 My stuff is at least it's in like a box.
01:08:53 It's not just like on the floor.
01:08:54 It's in like it's on the floor under the table, but it's in like a box.
01:08:59 But anyway, so I ignored it.
01:09:01 And then long story short, two days later I go again.
01:09:05 And this time I hear it again.
01:09:07 And this time I see two mice at the same time run out from under the table and run under the refrigerator.
01:09:13 And I'm like I think I think that my door closes tightly enough that the my that mice could not
01:09:24 come into my room as long as the the door was closed.
01:09:28 I think they could not get into my room unless they were to like burrow through the walls or
01:09:32 something. I don't know that for sure.
01:09:34 I would be very upset if there was like a mouse in my room like living in like a pile of my dirty
01:09:39 laundry or something that would that would ruin my my day.
01:09:41 There's not a chance there's not a mouse in your room.
01:09:43 There's one that poops in your mouth every night.
01:09:44 I'm sorry it's true.
01:09:49 So that's my other that's my other gripe.
01:09:55 Just pretend they're pets and then everything's fine.
01:09:57 Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
01:10:06 Can we pretend that mice that live under our table are really nice?
01:10:11 No they are nice. They seem nice. They're just gross.
01:10:14 You seem chill.
01:10:14 Mice are so small they're like cockroaches.
01:10:17 No they're not. They're cute no matter what.
01:10:20 They are a little cute.
01:10:22 They're cute but like if they're around on the floor and like you step on one and you kill it
01:10:29 that's terrible.
01:10:33 A corpse of any kind is not very cute.
01:10:35 I don't like knowing that like at any moment I could tread on an animal.
01:10:41 They are a little cute like up close but like from a distance like you turn on the light and one
01:10:46 of them scurries across the floor it's not it's it's like disgusting it's like it's a
01:10:50 cockroach it might as well be a cockroach.
01:10:52 I run over and try and give it a high five as quick as possible.
01:10:57 Ends up like slamming into the wall.
01:10:59 Just smushing it with my hand and killing the poor thing.
01:11:01 I would love have I ever I've probably mentioned the time that one time in my
01:11:06 old in monkey house I dropped a frying pan on a mouse on purpose.
01:11:10 There was a mouse and I saw it was on the floor and I was like how do we get it and I just dropped
01:11:15 a frying pan and it crushed it.
01:11:17 That's horrible.
01:11:19 I know but that's life.
01:11:23 That's not the life that's death.
01:11:24 That's mouse life ladies and gentlemen.
01:11:26 Son it's not disgusting it's just reality.
01:11:29 Take a deep breath and kill some mice.
01:11:33 Kill some mice.
01:11:37 Yeah.
01:11:39 I have to go to the bathroom.
01:11:40 I'll be back in one second.
01:11:42 I gotta pee.
01:11:42 Oh no we gotta entertain ourselves.
01:11:43 He's gonna go to the bathroom.
01:11:46 And he's gonna go and he's gonna go be like oh no that's blocked still.
01:11:50 It's clogged and there's mice in my toilet.
01:11:53 Then he's gonna walk over to the next the the other toilet and he's gonna
01:11:57 encounter a mouse or two and he's gonna come back and say guys there was a mouse's.
01:12:03 Oh my god.
01:12:04 That's my prediction.
01:12:04 Oh my god.
01:12:06 Oh my god.
01:12:09 Yeah you go oblivion for what you gotta say.
01:12:12 Um what do I have to say?
01:12:14 Um mouse cute.
01:12:19 What's better than a mouse?
01:12:20 A mouse woman.
01:12:21 No no here we go.
01:12:24 It's true.
01:12:27 There's a guy on youtube who draws for mouse and she has an ass and it's good.
01:12:35 Right is it?
01:12:36 I can imagine such a thing.
01:12:39 Is it the guy who's using the name of something like J-A-O.
01:12:43 J-I-O-E-O-E-O-E-O-E-O-E-O-E-O-E-O That's his name.
01:12:44 J-I-O-E-O-E-O-E-O-E-O-E-O-E-O He follows me.
01:12:47 It's great.
01:12:48 Yeah that's cool.
01:12:49 Legend moment.
01:12:51 Uh I wanted to think, I designed a mof uh a big tittie mof character.
01:12:57 Oh yeah I saw that that was cute.
01:12:58 On the draw cast.
01:12:59 I like that.
01:13:00 Yeah um she's cute and I and I thought of a really funny idea.
01:13:05 I'm back.
01:13:07 Hello.
01:13:07 What's not.
01:13:08 Part of a funny idea with my mof character.
01:13:10 I'll post a picture over if it doesn't show her pussy.
01:13:12 So that way you'll be safe.
01:13:14 Impossible.
01:13:14 I don't believe you've drawn such a thing.
01:13:17 It's cropped.
01:13:17 I mean, it's cropped.
01:13:19 Yeah, I cropped it.
01:13:20 Um, okay.
01:13:21 The uncropped is on my Patreon at the moment.
01:13:23 There's also a version where she lifts her shirt.
01:13:25 But, um, so, so the idea I had, if I want to, I want to have a NOC that's like a
01:13:31 masochist, uh, cause I think that's funny.
01:13:35 I think it's funny if you have a character who just wants to get beat up and
01:13:38 they think it's good, actually.
01:13:41 Um, I thought, what if, what if I do that with a character who's a bug?
01:13:44 She's just a little bug and she wants, she wants you to like pull her fucking
01:13:48 legs off and shit.
01:13:50 Oh my God.
01:13:54 Yikes.
01:13:55 Cause I drew it with two arms and I'm like, people like, oh, don't usually like,
01:13:57 if you're drawing like a bug girl, you give her four arms.
01:14:00 And I'm like, oh, I fought about it.
01:14:02 I'm like, no, she had the other arms pulled off because, um, she enjoys it.
01:14:06 And then they just grow back.
01:14:08 They grow back and pull them off again.
01:14:10 You know, you can't pull off too many, you can't pull off too many at a time.
01:14:14 You can't put a whole, yeah.
01:14:15 Like she, she, she's got to keep at least two so she can go for her daily
01:14:18 functions, but, uh, she, she likes bug zappers, you know, you know, people in
01:14:22 the BDSM sometimes I like getting electric shocks.
01:14:24 She likes the bug zapper.
01:14:26 She likes to fly swatter.
01:14:27 She likes newspapers.
01:14:28 She likes getting hit by cars.
01:14:30 Um, I, I, I was like, what?
01:14:33 Like splatting on the windshield, just splatting on the windshield.
01:14:35 Yeah.
01:14:35 Oh, I was thinking about size cars.
01:14:38 Yeah, like human, human cars.
01:14:40 She's in the human world.
01:14:41 She's just this, she's like one foot tall or something.
01:14:44 She's, she's got to be at least big enough to put a penis in.
01:14:47 Um, and it's too big and that's also good.
01:14:50 And I thought of a funny like music video.
01:14:52 I just want to montage of her just getting squashed and electrocuted, but enjoying
01:14:55 it and then go into a bug hospital and just, I've been thinking of all these
01:15:02 funny ideas in my head and I want to do like a simple, I want to do in like a
01:15:05 simplified, like almost like barely more of a storyboard style animation similar
01:15:11 to that, uh, that one guy who draws the mouse for joy.
01:15:14 Oh, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you.
01:15:16 Um, anything that'd be fun.
01:15:17 Yeah, the only thing is that after drawing this character, I stared at it
01:15:22 and I stared at it for a while and I'm like, looks, looks a little familiar.
01:15:28 Looks.
01:15:30 Oh, no.
01:15:30 I, I, I hope.
01:15:32 Wait, I think I see it.
01:15:33 I see it.
01:15:34 Yeah.
01:15:35 Yeah.
01:15:36 And I'm like, huh, maybe I should change the hair a bit because it's a little too
01:15:41 similar to someone we know.
01:15:45 She doesn't have a copyright on that hair style.
01:15:52 I think it's just like the mitt.
01:15:53 Yeah.
01:15:54 It's Marge Simpson.
01:15:56 Oh, yeah, Marge Simpson, she starts with an M.
01:15:59 Exactly.
01:15:59 You're right.
01:16:00 I don't know.
01:16:00 I couldn't tell, so I don't know.
01:16:02 You know, I actually think Marge Simpson might not even be real.
01:16:06 That's a controversial opinion, but if she's not, if she's a fictional character,
01:16:10 she can't copyright anything.
01:16:12 True.
01:16:13 Mickey Mouse can't even copyright themselves.
01:16:15 So really, um, it's all fair game.
01:16:18 True.
01:16:19 True question.
01:16:20 Only his, his, uh, his master, his, his, his wrangler can, can copyright Mickey Mouse.
01:16:28 John Mickey, what's his name?
01:16:30 John Doon.
01:16:30 No, he can't because he's dead.
01:16:32 It's true.
01:16:32 No, it's Walter Mouse.
01:16:34 Because he's fucking dead.
01:16:36 Walter J.
01:16:37 Is that from, is that from Mr.
01:16:38 Boop?
01:16:40 Walter Mouse.
01:16:42 Yeah.
01:16:43 No, it's doing like Walt Disney, but his last name is Mouse.
01:16:46 Okay.
01:16:46 Okay.
01:16:47 And he named his Mickey after it.
01:16:48 But in Mr.
01:16:49 Boop, he goes to, no, it's, no, it's Mr.
01:16:52 Boop, but Mr, doesn't Mr.
01:16:54 Boop also own Mickey or just, or did they just mention Mickey?
01:16:58 Because Mickey has copyright issues also in that.
01:17:02 That's part of the story.
01:17:03 Oh, it's been so long since I read it.
01:17:04 I have no idea.
01:17:06 You can't have been that long.
01:17:07 It was only last year.
01:17:08 Yeah, but I'm a fucking idiot.
01:17:09 But I, I, yeah, well, I forget to.
01:17:11 So who am I?
01:17:13 Who, who am I judge?
01:17:15 Uh, no, I got, no, I don't think so.
01:17:18 Cause I, cause I remembered there was like, oh, big copyright man.
01:17:23 But I was thinking of Mr.
01:17:24 Boop, like the, the dad.
01:17:26 But then I also remember that Mickey is like, oh, oh, my, my master
01:17:31 wouldn't be happy if he knew that I was having orgies with other cartoon
01:17:35 characters.
01:17:36 Oh, and, uh, and I conflated, I conflated them.
01:17:39 No way.
01:17:41 Hmm.
01:17:42 No way.
01:17:43 Mickey Mouse did that.
01:17:44 It's true.
01:17:45 He did.
01:17:45 Master would be happy.
01:17:46 Clearly.
01:17:47 You see his dick.
01:17:48 You see Mickey's dick in that.
01:17:49 My main memory from Mr.
01:17:51 Boop was a, a very move Goku coming downstairs with a bath towel around his
01:17:54 cock saying, Hey, get back here with continuing the orgy or something like
01:17:57 that.
01:17:58 And I was like, that's awesome.
01:17:59 I think that happened.
01:18:01 Yeah.
01:18:02 That was, that was pretty good.
01:18:03 That's pretty good.
01:18:03 Mid, mid, mid, mid, mid run.
01:18:09 That's stuck with me.
01:18:10 There's a, just the, the, the, the, the, in the orgy era.
01:18:15 There's something about sticking Goku in things that makes it funny.
01:18:17 I don't know why.
01:18:18 Yeah.
01:18:19 Is it his like ridiculously like carved angular muscles.
01:18:24 Yes.
01:18:24 That clash with every other art style.
01:18:27 It exists.
01:18:28 It's true.
01:18:29 And then it's also the, the eyebrows.
01:18:32 It's the fact that he's, he's, he's wacky silly as well.
01:18:35 Goku is a wacky silly character.
01:18:37 So putting him like in anything is just odd.
01:18:40 I don't know why he does, he does act.
01:18:43 He is silly enough that his, his, his personality is like cartoonish, goofy,
01:18:48 Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, goofy style, I guess, but he just looks like that.
01:18:54 Yeah.
01:18:55 This is beefcake muscle, man.
01:18:56 What a hero.
01:18:58 Yeah.
01:18:58 A true shonen hero.
01:19:02 Speaking of which, I've been reading Full Metal Alchemist recently
01:19:05 because I watched it like years ago and I remember literally nothing about it.
01:19:11 So it's.
01:19:11 Did you watch Brotherhood?
01:19:13 I think I watched Brotherhood.
01:19:14 Yes.
01:19:15 Okay.
01:19:15 I believe so.
01:19:16 I've only seen the original.
01:19:17 I've never seen Brotherhood.
01:19:18 I know the original gets pretty crazy and it sounds funny and cool, but.
01:19:23 I, it's pretty weird.
01:19:26 The original, the original ending and the movie that they made about it is
01:19:32 pretty, is pretty fucking weird.
01:19:35 I liked it.
01:19:35 I liked it a lot.
01:19:36 It sounds very unique for it.
01:19:39 And I, yeah, there were like little bits in the manga that I
01:19:42 referenced that I was reading that were like, you know, how like the beginning
01:19:45 of a manga chapter, sometimes the author will have like a comment.
01:19:47 And it was, it was, she was talking about how the anime was ending.
01:19:52 And I was like, oh, Jesus, that makes, that puts it in timeline really
01:19:56 weirdly in my head.
01:19:57 Yeah.
01:19:57 But, um, and like how she, she, she gave them a few ideas and was just like, yeah,
01:20:02 go wild.
01:20:02 And she loved the way that it went.
01:20:04 And I was like, ah, that's cool.
01:20:06 Maybe I'll have to give the anime a chance someday.
01:20:08 This is very, it's like George, it's like George RR Martin.
01:20:11 It's like Game of Thrones.
01:20:12 They're just like, well, I'm still right in the book.
01:20:14 They're, they're finishing the, the show.
01:20:16 Uh, I guess I'll just tell them like, uh, what if you did this?
01:20:18 What if you, what if you ended like that?
01:20:20 Fuck it.
01:20:21 Um, is that how, is that something that happened?
01:20:25 I thought he was like largely like disconnected from the show running by
01:20:30 that, the point they were going beyond the books.
01:20:33 I remember hearing that he gave them the outlines for the end.
01:20:35 And he like barely understood what was going on.
01:20:37 It's just like, well, you know, that's, that's their thing now.
01:20:39 So I, I don't think so because I don't, I mean, he might have been less involved
01:20:44 by that point than he was originally, but I think he did have input because I
01:20:49 remember they talked about like the, the, the hold the door thing was like
01:20:54 direction him.
01:20:55 Like, like he told them about that.
01:20:56 That's, that's, they didn't come up with that.
01:20:58 Right.
01:20:59 The, yeah.
01:21:01 He, I'm sure he gave them like a general gist of like where characters end up.
01:21:08 Um, but like the, I mean, a lot of the reason the show is so like shit right at
01:21:16 the end is that they have the ending in mind and they don't like,
01:21:20 they don't properly build to it.
01:21:22 They just sort of have the characters as they've evolved through the show as opposed
01:21:27 to the books and then, you know, changed a few character arcs and like dropped a
01:21:31 bunch of them and just say, okay, well, you wouldn't do this, but because your
01:21:35 ending is coming up, you will now do this.
01:21:38 And it's completely out of character for you in the show.
01:21:41 And who cares six episodes in the last season, just get, get it done.
01:21:46 Well, and that's why that was like different.
01:21:49 So I know he, he had, he had some like say in like, what would the ending be?
01:21:55 Yeah.
01:21:56 That he has for his book thing.
01:21:57 I remember hearing that he gave an outline of who ends up where, like in terms
01:22:01 of throne things like that.
01:22:04 Yeah.
01:22:04 I don't know if I should just say it.
01:22:06 I think he may have changed his plan since though.
01:22:09 Like he's, he's, he's mentioned that his, his books will not be the same as the show.
01:22:17 Yeah.
01:22:17 I think that's a given.
01:22:18 Which is a.
01:22:19 Yeah.
01:22:20 So I'm wondering if he like just said, here's my like first draft ideas for how
01:22:26 the show ends or how the books end and use that.
01:22:29 I kind of like that.
01:22:31 I know the second My Hero Academia movie does that where the author of the
01:22:35 manga had come up with what he wanted the final action scene to be.
01:22:39 And he changed his mind.
01:22:40 So he just gave them that to do in the movie.
01:22:42 And it's just fucking ridiculous.
01:22:43 And it's like, oh, it's in a non-canon movie.
01:22:45 So it's nice that we got to see it.
01:22:47 It's that that's fun.
01:22:48 I like that.
01:22:49 It's not the ending of the TV show that everyone loved and ruining it though.
01:22:55 They didn't actually love it, right?
01:22:57 No.
01:22:57 Yeah.
01:22:58 Okay.
01:23:00 Uh, I don't, I don't, I haven't seen, I haven't, I've read a little bit of, I like,
01:23:04 I read the beginning of My Hero Academia.
01:23:06 It is fine.
01:23:08 It's completely the most like white bread.
01:23:11 Like, yeah, this is quality, but there's nothing, there's really nothing special
01:23:17 about it, aside from the art style.
01:23:18 I think I liked, I did like the art impression.
01:23:21 Yeah, I like how the faces look, like how the eyes look on the, I like that the
01:23:25 mouths, the mouths and the teeth.
01:23:27 The mouths are always really like rounded and cute looking and fun.
01:23:31 And the teeth are very detailed and weird.
01:23:33 Ben, into Vor once again, clearly.
01:23:36 I, I, it was, it was all over like the internet, like everyone was talking about,
01:23:41 it felt like everyone was talking about My Hero Academia for a while.
01:23:44 I had checked it out a little bit before that.
01:23:46 I think maybe Nate had talked about it or someone had talked about it.
01:23:49 And I had checked it out and I read a bit and I was like, yeah, that's cool.
01:23:52 I think I liked the gimmick of like, I think I was, I think I liked, uh, All Might.
01:23:59 I think that like, that he was like, that he was, I liked that he was like weak.
01:24:03 Yeah.
01:24:03 I don't know.
01:24:03 I thought that was reminds me of myself.
01:24:08 I think I checked it.
01:24:09 Yeah.
01:24:09 It's, it's, but, but, but then now late, everyone, it seemed like everyone was
01:24:14 really, really excited about it on the internet for a while.
01:24:16 But now, whenever I see anyone talk about it, it's like they were, it seems
01:24:19 like everyone was disappointed in it.
01:24:20 Or it seems like generally the opinion has somewhat turned.
01:24:24 Yeah.
01:24:24 I think not like hugely against it, but somewhat.
01:24:26 I think part of it is what I like to call the legend of core effect where
01:24:29 something is okay, but then everyone like turns on it because it's so popular
01:24:33 and loved.
01:24:35 Um, yeah, that, that has happened to some extent of it.
01:24:38 There are definitely parts of the series that I think kind of smell and a boring,
01:24:42 but like the last like year or so of it have been pretty like solid.
01:24:47 I don't know.
01:24:48 But, um, seems, seems kind of like what happened to attack on Titan.
01:24:51 Yes.
01:24:51 This is my hero academia, a, a, a manga story about a young man with a super
01:25:01 power and all these people who have superpowers, but they also have to go to
01:25:04 school and they're superpowers at school.
01:25:07 Is that what it's about?
01:25:08 Yes.
01:25:09 That's right.
01:25:09 Basically.
01:25:10 That's right.
01:25:10 Damn.
01:25:11 So basic.
01:25:12 I know.
01:25:12 So fringe.
01:25:13 Exactly.
01:25:15 I assume that's what it was from what I saw.
01:25:17 And I'm like, there's a little twistiness of it.
01:25:20 One punch man just come out and it's like a parody of that and it's so much funnier.
01:25:24 One punch man doesn't go to school.
01:25:26 Yeah.
01:25:26 No, but like it's like.
01:25:27 Also, that was like 10 years ago of one punch man is like 100 years old now.
01:25:32 Go with the times.
01:25:33 I feel like the thing that sets my hero academia apart is the fact that the
01:25:36 they explained that the, that it's 90% of the planet or something like,
01:25:40 or 99% of the planet that have some super power.
01:25:43 So it isn't just like a certain people have it.
01:25:45 It's everybody has something and some people are really good.
01:25:48 But like, what does that change about it?
01:25:50 It's cool.
01:25:50 Like it's all right.
01:25:53 Shonen, generally, they are a vehicle by which combat can be, you know,
01:26:04 experienced.
01:26:04 Exactly.
01:26:05 My hero academia.
01:26:06 What if this was like a fight and instead of punching, there was some weird wacky thing instead.
01:26:14 My hero academia.
01:26:15 Bulk of what the Shonen genre is about.
01:26:18 Takes place in an alternate timeline of the Incredibles universe where syndrome
01:26:22 one, yes, and everybody got a, got a super power.
01:26:24 That's true.
01:26:25 That's true.
01:26:25 Dude, that's correct.
01:26:27 And so Madagascar.
01:26:30 Huh?
01:26:31 That's true.
01:26:32 Madagascar ending.
01:26:33 That's true.
01:26:34 I look, I got this, I saw like a video talking about this, but if you see a
01:26:38 world map and attack on Titan after everything gets expanded and they,
01:26:42 they leave the walls and they leave Ireland and everything.
01:26:46 And the world map is just Earth, just flipped upside down and everything
01:26:50 takes place on Madagascar.
01:26:53 Crazy.
01:26:53 Like the movie Madagascar?
01:26:55 No, like the, the play like, is Madagascar the movie canon to attack on Titan?
01:27:03 The movie Madagascar isn't a fictional place that Dreamworks invented.
01:27:05 It's real, it's a real place.
01:27:08 Yeah, but, yeah, but I want to know if the events of the film Madagascar and
01:27:12 sequels are canon to attack on Titan.
01:27:13 Did Chantelle Dubois happen in the, in the attack on Titan universe?
01:27:17 Did that villain from Madagascar three Europe's most wanted, the best
01:27:20 film ever made?
01:27:21 Did she canon to attack on Titan?
01:27:24 That is, she is an acrimon.
01:27:27 She is a descendant.
01:27:28 Oh, cool.
01:27:30 Very nice.
01:27:31 Attack on Titan is another movie Madagascar free.
01:27:33 It's a game of fucking psychotic.
01:27:34 I kind of think she's great.
01:27:36 I would say Attack on Titan is a game of thrones level blunder for me.
01:27:39 I know some people really like the ending, but I fucking get it.
01:27:43 Oh, I never, I never got to the ending.
01:27:46 I'm very excited because the, the last season is coming out now, I think.
01:27:50 So people are going to see the ending.
01:27:51 I'm very excited to see the discourse come around about it and see what people think.
01:27:55 I think, I think the ending is weird.
01:27:57 I, I liked when like the world opened up and we got to see, see like all like.
01:28:02 Yeah, I love that.
01:28:03 The world has like more modern technology that like to me made the show
01:28:06 finally like actually interesting because I didn't, I didn't care about that.
01:28:10 It was just a big mystery box fest for a long time.
01:28:13 I didn't give a shit about that really.
01:28:16 And then when I said it's like a game of thrones, I mean, like
01:28:19 the very last second it throws the bucket in like the last five chapters,
01:28:23 I think Attack on Titan just falls off a cliff.
01:28:27 Do the fucking weird.
01:28:29 The bigger they are, the harder they fall BS.
01:28:32 We can't, we can't talk about it because it's going on right now.
01:28:35 And I don't want to ruin it for people, but for my own opinions, it sucks.
01:28:41 The Titans are actually not as big as we thought.
01:28:44 They were actually bigger Titans and those they just
01:28:48 one of the biggest Titans in the universe came and he put his foot down,
01:28:52 smashed the earth, everyone's dead.
01:28:53 It's you've seen, you've seen the end of Gerr, of Gerr and Lagann when,
01:28:57 when, when the guys in their mechs get their mechs into bigger mechs
01:29:00 and then they get those mechs into even bigger mechs.
01:29:03 Well, Attack on Titan, same thing.
01:29:04 The Titans get form even bigger Titans around themselves.
01:29:08 It's alarming how on point you guys are.
01:29:11 Oh, no, you're kind of like unironically correct.
01:29:16 Yeah, it's been addressed.
01:29:18 It's been addressed in the anime at this point.
01:29:20 So we can't kind of talk about it, but there's this concept called the rumbling
01:29:22 where like a fuckload of colossal.
01:29:24 You remember the colossal Titan, the really, really big guy.
01:29:27 Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's like hundreds of them and a character.
01:29:31 It's millions at the word that they specifically say that there's millions.
01:29:35 Is it millions? Jesus.
01:29:37 That's that's at least the translation I read of the is millions of them said that
01:29:42 and they're going to use them to wipe out the rest of the planet as revenge for being fucked over.
01:29:46 It's just big.
01:29:47 All right. How tall is a colossus Titan?
01:29:50 I think the colossal one is the one that is like taller than the walls of the like 60.
01:29:54 They're like so like hundreds and hundreds.
01:29:56 Yeah, they're like.
01:29:58 Yeah, hmm.
01:30:00 I'm trying to think of like like the biggest dinosaurs and how like the potentially
01:30:05 largest way bigger, way bigger, way bigger.
01:30:07 OK, no, a regular, a regular Titan is like a regular Titan is like dinosaur size.
01:30:13 The colossal Titan is like.
01:30:15 I mean, even I mean, it's like it's like a hundred blue whales or bigger, bigger than that even.
01:30:20 Should I post all of the manga panels?
01:30:23 No, no, it's Godzilla.
01:30:24 It's Godzilla sized or even bigger than Godzilla sized.
01:30:26 Should I post one of the manga panels to give some idea?
01:30:29 I'll I'll I'll I'll I'll I'll provide.
01:30:30 I'll provide.
01:30:31 So there's this funny flash game called Age of War, right?
01:30:35 Mm hmm.
01:30:36 Do you remember this as cool?
01:30:38 I remember I had Halo music as I've ever played this one.
01:30:43 Well, anyway, there's these funny YouTube videos.
01:30:45 Why is there like a Jesus meter in the top right?
01:30:48 It's like a guy being crucified.
01:30:49 You can use your smite ability or something.
01:30:52 OK. Well, anyway, there's a funny YouTube video.
01:30:56 There's a whole bunch of videos like doing size comparisons for all the Titans
01:30:59 and some of the really wacky crazy ones that come out in every end
01:31:02 that are like 400 meters tall or some bullshit.
01:31:06 And the videos look like this game.
01:31:09 They have these little funny walking animations that are really janky
01:31:12 and they're just walking in place and it's really funny.
01:31:16 But but the size comparison is useful, I guess.
01:31:19 But it's spoilery.
01:31:20 I don't know if I could share if people care about spoilers.
01:31:24 I don't care when the Colossus Titan from Attack on Titan
01:31:30 or the behelit like like what's his face?
01:31:35 The many faced big guy.
01:31:37 Ganesha from Berserk.
01:31:39 Ganesha a man from Berserk.
01:31:41 I think Ganesha would win because he's fucking like a god man by the end, isn't he?
01:31:45 He turns into a tree, though, and he has no brain.
01:31:48 He's like so he's so he did the thing twice.
01:31:52 I mean, all the Colossus Titans do is walk forward and kill people basically.
01:31:56 They just stomp.
01:31:58 Oh, my gosh, dude.
01:31:59 This is the size comparison video.
01:32:00 Me, me, me cast a acrimon, the smallest Titan of them all.
01:32:03 It's true.
01:32:05 It's canon.
01:32:05 Oh, God, these fucking flash puppets.
01:32:07 Why did they even bother?
01:32:09 Why don't they animate it like this?
01:32:12 Why wouldn't you just have you could just have a static image?
01:32:15 It would be fine.
01:32:16 It's terrifying.
01:32:18 It's because it's an animated show, Ben.
01:32:20 You've got to have animated in your YouTube.
01:32:23 Literally like skipped like to the five minute mark to start seeing the big ones,
01:32:27 I guess. Yeah.
01:32:29 They're pretty big.
01:32:31 This is a terrible video.
01:32:33 They start out pretty small.
01:32:35 Really funny.
01:32:37 They start out pretty small.
01:32:38 They're only oh, hmm.
01:32:40 Hmm.
01:32:42 How do they hold up their own way?
01:32:45 A cartoon logic, because, you know,
01:32:48 attack is a wacky silly cartoon found founding Titan.
01:32:52 Oh, my God.
01:32:53 What the?
01:32:55 Yeah, it gets pretty crazy.
01:32:56 That's stuff I like.
01:32:58 It's just like.
01:33:00 I've never seen this like fucking fish skeleton one.
01:33:02 Yeah.
01:33:04 Oh, well, that's that's a spoiler.
01:33:06 OK, that's a huge.
01:33:07 That's what happens when you tell Aaron Yeager that he smells like a barker
01:33:11 and he turns into a giant fish monster and kills the entire planet.
01:33:15 Yeah. Jesus.
01:33:16 It's pretty cool. OK, there.
01:33:18 Well, like, technically,
01:33:19 technically, I've watched the whole show now.
01:33:21 That's true.
01:33:22 That's all that's all that runs in the rib cage.
01:33:24 I see the most creepy monsters.
01:33:28 These things are disgusting.
01:33:29 Then these are like, then it's genuinely invested in the designs.
01:33:33 I am. No, I always was.
01:33:35 I always really liked how like how just how viscerally gross
01:33:39 and like I hate these things so much.
01:33:41 The Titans are like, they're so vile.
01:33:43 It's one of the strongest aspects of it, I think.
01:33:45 Yeah, I like the founding Titan.
01:33:47 Yeah, wherever the.
01:33:49 And I know the manga artist has like another artist
01:33:52 who does like the really nice panels that show up every so often.
01:33:55 Oh, really? The founding Titan is pretty cool.
01:33:57 I they have to because the art style is like suddenly like really good on some
01:34:01 yeah, and then it looks janky elsewhere.
01:34:02 I will say because the guy panels.
01:34:04 The guy's like not a very good artist.
01:34:06 Like his original manga is like, it looks pretty shit.
01:34:08 Yeah, the first few volumes are pretty rough looking,
01:34:11 but I feel he really does improve throughout the course of it.
01:34:14 And it does look great unless like oblivion for said the other guy was doing the whole thing.
01:34:19 He he he doesn't improve.
01:34:21 He probably also had assistance to do like, you know, cleaner,
01:34:24 cleaner line work and stuff like this.
01:34:26 It's fucking cool. I'm sorry.
01:34:29 This one's pretty spoilery.
01:34:30 I shouldn't have posted that. Oh, God.
01:34:33 It's horrible. It's OK. I didn't mind.
01:34:35 I'm pretty sure I like this image where the where the skeleton
01:34:40 like is just screaming.
01:34:41 You look at his jaw and it's just wide open.
01:34:44 I'm pretty sure the show's reached this point.
01:34:46 I haven't watched the last two episodes,
01:34:47 but I'm pretty sure it's reached. Yeah, I think it's I've got gearing up.
01:34:52 I've heard big stuff.
01:34:54 I've heard that the.
01:34:56 Oh, you know what?
01:34:57 I remember at the end of the part of the show I watched,
01:35:00 you see the wall crumble and you see what's inside the wall.
01:35:03 So OK, this is kind of like I kind of get what's going on all the millions of
01:35:07 Titans that stomp on that stomp on everyone are the ones from the walls, basically.
01:35:12 Yeah, I did.
01:35:13 I did always want to finish the show because I did like what I read.
01:35:17 Everyone said the ending was was bad and it gets really stupid.
01:35:20 And that was like that a chilling effect on me.
01:35:24 I guess I wasn't enjoying the show for a while.
01:35:28 I read after like because we were waiting a million years for season two
01:35:32 and then eventually I'm like, fuck it, I'll read a bit of the manga.
01:35:34 And I did. I would I would rather watch.
01:35:37 I would rather read almost any manga than watch the show version.
01:35:39 Yeah, basically unilaterally.
01:35:42 I don't know if there's any exception to that.
01:35:44 I mean, in terms of a show,
01:35:46 I would say it's only worth watching up until the end of season three,
01:35:49 because that's when they still had their really good animator on board,
01:35:52 the one who is basically who basically fucking carried the whole show.
01:35:57 By doing like every fucking action scene by being a god tiered piece of shit,
01:36:02 who I love.
01:36:04 And then in season four, they changed studios
01:36:06 and that guy no longer works in the show.
01:36:08 We also did all the best like fighting like moments
01:36:12 and one punch man as well.
01:36:14 Yeah.
01:36:16 Right, right, right.
01:36:17 He's a really good animator.
01:36:19 So it's worth seeing at least his scenes because they are really well done.
01:36:23 But beyond that, just read the manga, probably.
01:36:26 The Mr. Boop guy, Alec Robbins, a little while back,
01:36:29 I think he finally got around to watching Mob Psycho
01:36:33 and he said he loved Mob Psycho.
01:36:35 So he was gushing about it.
01:36:37 It made me want to check it out.
01:36:38 Oh, you haven't seen Mob Psycho?
01:36:40 No, I have not seen Mob Psycho.
01:36:41 Oh, it's really good.
01:36:44 I only I only hear really good things about it.
01:36:46 Yeah, it's what I did.
01:36:47 I did like one punch man, although I never finished one punch man.
01:36:51 Yeah, but it's in the anime season or the manga.
01:36:54 I I think I read up to the point in the manga
01:36:58 that had been drawn at the time.
01:37:00 I don't know if it if it finished, I assume it did.
01:37:03 No, the manga is still going, I believe.
01:37:05 Really? Oh, wow. OK.
01:37:08 Because the web comics still going as well, I think,
01:37:11 because you know how it's as he needed to use two punches at this point.
01:37:15 With the web, that's the web comic.
01:37:17 Like the originally drawn web comic is still going. Yes, I think so.
01:37:21 What? Yeah, no way.
01:37:24 They're still building up to crazy shit, apparently.
01:37:26 I haven't kept up with it, but I see stuff every now and again
01:37:29 when talking to people and it seems like it's going strong.
01:37:31 I didn't watch.
01:37:32 I didn't watch the anime because I had read the manga.
01:37:35 I know it looked great.
01:37:36 Everyone praised the animation and it did look pretty good,
01:37:39 but like I don't really care that the manga is also one of the best looking
01:37:42 manga of all time. It does.
01:37:44 It does. Yeah, it really does.
01:37:46 Although I still like the idea of reading the original
01:37:50 web comic comic that drawn by one, even though even though the art is bad.
01:37:55 Like, I just think that's cool.
01:37:57 Yeah, I don't know.
01:37:58 Yeah, I need to read that.
01:38:00 That's what makes Mob Psycho work so well is because it's directly
01:38:04 it's directly adapted from his comic as opposed to like a re adaptation
01:38:08 in the manga, like where it's drawn better.
01:38:10 So it's like, yeah, it's these sketchy, simplistic character designs
01:38:13 that are like focused entirely on expression, basically, and not aesthetic
01:38:17 quality and they're animated by the gods at Studio Bones.
01:38:21 And it just makes Mob Psycho one of the best looking things ever.
01:38:25 So they can they can go very simple with the faces and stuff
01:38:28 and then go crazy with like effects and things like that and motion.
01:38:32 Yeah. So it was it was a manga first.
01:38:34 Yeah, Mob Psycho was a manga, which was like OK.
01:38:38 I think it was pretty short.
01:38:39 I think it was like 10 or 11 volumes, so it wasn't crazy long.
01:38:42 But yeah. Yeah.
01:38:44 I should I should watch it's great.
01:38:46 Season three coming at some point this year, which I think will be the end.
01:38:49 Oh, it's still going. Yeah, I thought it was I thought it was done.
01:38:52 I thought it was just a one season one and then season two came out in like
01:38:55 twenty seventeen, so it's been like years.
01:38:57 Yeah, because I didn't want to read the man because the anime is too good.
01:39:01 It's one of those things where I got caught. Yeah, that's fair.
01:39:06 My friend's been he's been watching one piece of the anime, all of it.
01:39:10 And he's on nice.
01:39:11 He's on Dressroser at the moment and he's starting to feel it.
01:39:14 He's starting to feel that the slow.
01:39:16 I think that's Dressroser in specific is like terrible.
01:39:23 I think most people stopped at that point and switched to reading the manga.
01:39:27 Yeah, I think I switched to reading the manga a few arcs earlier.
01:39:31 It was I got frustrated.
01:39:32 I got frustrated with the pace even reading the manga in in I think it was
01:39:37 Fishman Island. Yeah, I was like, this is this is going on a really long time.
01:39:42 It was at the time the biggest arc, Fishman Island.
01:39:45 Yeah, you can say that about every arc at this point.
01:39:48 I got I can't imagine watching longer.
01:39:52 I can't imagine watching all of the show at this point.
01:39:54 I know, I don't know how he did it.
01:39:57 It's got to be like it's it's got to be over a thousand episodes, right?
01:40:00 There's something I've noticed where where people seem to have
01:40:04 like a like a like a charge in them of how much
01:40:06 anime they can watch in their lifetime.
01:40:08 And then like after you've watched a certain amount,
01:40:09 you'd switch to like way shorter stuff or you'd stop watching.
01:40:12 Yeah, because like he's realized that it's just more efficient.
01:40:16 Yeah, it's just the better you see your time.
01:40:17 My friend, his only watched Naruto and Fulmer Alchemist, I think, before One Piece.
01:40:23 He was really not like a big anime guy and it's like, wow, yeah.
01:40:27 How is he doing?
01:40:28 I think it would take one piece as a as like an like if you haven't seen a lot
01:40:34 of anime is very good mostly because of like the really good music that sells
01:40:42 a lot of the epic moments and gets you hyped to watch the next episode every time.
01:40:46 It's very easy to binge.
01:40:48 I remember watching, I think like the anime was like a thriller bark or something beyond that.
01:40:57 I actually can't remember, but like I remember binging all of One Piece and I
01:41:03 got like like a couple of hundred episodes in a week.
01:41:06 Yeah, that's maybe more than that.
01:41:09 And it was like, it was great.
01:41:10 I can't remember.
01:41:11 I like it's it's kind of upsetting though, because it's like the music and some
01:41:15 of the scenes that are depicted in the anime of One Piece are like so like emotional.
01:41:22 Yeah.
01:41:22 And like it being animated and with the sound effects and the voice acting and
01:41:28 then the music, yeah, it adds so much to those moments.
01:41:31 But like, I can't recommend people watch One Piece.
01:41:34 That's so fucking long.
01:41:35 Yeah, they'd never do it.
01:41:37 Completely agree.
01:41:38 That's it's it's big.
01:41:40 Binks sake is so much better in in the in the anime.
01:41:43 Yeah, you can hear it when there's a whole musical sequence to it.
01:41:46 But yeah, but you'd have to but you'd have to watch 981 episodes a few years ago.
01:41:50 Do it when I got into One Piece.
01:41:51 It was like I watched the podcast like live thingy.
01:41:55 I think it was and like where you talk about how to get into it.
01:41:57 I think briefly and it's like, I'll read the manga and watch all the
01:42:00 bit the moments that you liked the most from the manga on YouTube.
01:42:03 And I did that and that was pretty much perfect.
01:42:06 Yeah.
01:42:07 And I did some I did some listening to the soundtrack while I read it
01:42:10 because I'm one of those weirdos.
01:42:12 The the OK.
01:42:14 So it's 981 episodes, which OK.
01:42:18 I guess you you could watch all of the all of that in less time
01:42:22 than I have spent playing Noida in my life.
01:42:26 So yeah, that's you know.
01:42:29 So I guess I guess I I guess you could do it.
01:42:32 I swear it's more than that.
01:42:33 But I could have sworn they got past episode 1000.
01:42:36 I thought it would be for the bankers gone past that.
01:42:39 Yeah, apparently the way the anime is on episode 1008.
01:42:43 Apparently, according to this totally legal anime watching website.
01:42:46 Oh, well, I well,
01:42:48 Google says 981.
01:42:50 Well, they're bloody maybe they're maybe they're wrong.
01:42:52 OK, OK, OK, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
01:42:55 Oh, oh, here's another interesting detail.
01:42:57 I think he's watching the dub, which is.
01:43:02 I don't think I've ever heard a whole show.
01:43:04 Yeah, they've gotten up to Zoe, I think.
01:43:07 So he's going to have to switch soon.
01:43:09 They they they Zoe is the elephant.
01:43:12 Yeah. Yeah.
01:43:13 Just before Holkig Island.
01:43:15 So I don't think I've ever heard anyone speak about the one piece stuff.
01:43:20 So people don't know that I remember back in the day that the dub was done
01:43:25 by four kids and it was like laughable and that's terrible adaptation.
01:43:29 That's how I found it.
01:43:30 That's how I that's how I got into one piece was through the four kids dub.
01:43:34 But then there was another dub.
01:43:35 Was it the Funimation?
01:43:37 Yeah, it's Funimation.
01:43:38 Yeah, and they should be doing the entire show.
01:43:41 Yes, I did.
01:43:42 Did they I thought they just kind of picked up where four kids left off?
01:43:45 No, they went back and did it later for DVD releases, apparently.
01:43:48 OK, well, that's probably good.
01:43:50 The whole thing exists.
01:43:51 And I listened to some clips of it.
01:43:52 It's surprisingly pretty good.
01:43:55 Something about Shodan works in dubs for me.
01:43:58 I don't love Luffy's voice, though.
01:44:00 It's kind of not great, which is kind of a problem.
01:44:02 What does it sound like?
01:44:03 It's the big character.
01:44:05 Did you ever watch Dragon Ball Kai Gip?
01:44:07 Nope.
01:44:08 OK, it's the voice actress for Gohan from that.
01:44:11 And it's Hello and Luffy.
01:44:15 It's a little too scrimmy.
01:44:17 Luffy is scrimmy, but there's lots of deadpan moments.
01:44:19 Yeah. Oh, what do you what do you mean, Zoro?
01:44:22 Yeah, it's a bit like that.
01:44:24 It's a bit full on all the time and just a tiny bit too feminine.
01:44:29 I'm a pirate. Believe it.
01:44:31 Yeah. Yeah, it's a it's a little Naruto dub kind of.
01:44:35 No, that's a shame.
01:44:37 That's a shame.
01:44:39 But everyone else is pretty solid.
01:44:41 I like I like what I saw.
01:44:43 Usopp is just Krillin, because, of course, he is.
01:44:45 Yeah, I heard they got him.
01:44:48 No, it sounds that makes sense.
01:44:50 I think the thing is in the Japanese dub is is that like
01:44:56 the voice actress plays Luffy.
01:45:00 In a way that he sometimes just sounds like a monkey.
01:45:02 Yeah, like he laughs like a monkey.
01:45:05 He also has a lot of deadpan deliveries, I think, I feel like.
01:45:08 In the anime, which people don't talk about a lot,
01:45:10 but the her voice performance is him.
01:45:12 There's a lot of moments where she's like, oh, OK, like that.
01:45:14 And I'm like, that works pretty well.
01:45:16 And there's none of that in the dub, which is a problem, in my opinion.
01:45:19 Because Luffy saying things flat because he's a fucking moron is
01:45:22 one of my favorite things about him.
01:45:26 Next episode of Talking Pirates will talk more.
01:45:32 I haven't watched Pease.
01:45:34 I haven't. What am I?
01:45:36 What am I? I'm still I'm still at.
01:45:38 I'm still at in one piece, the place where I was
01:45:41 when I almost caught up at Radcon 4, which is I'm past Whole Cake.
01:45:48 Oh, hey, I had just gotten to Wano.
01:45:50 Yeah. So you went through the the reverie stuff,
01:45:54 which is like a few chapters in between.
01:45:56 Wait, that's when all the kings and queens come together and chat.
01:46:01 Yes, Rebecca and VV together, and they look exactly the same.
01:46:05 Hmm, because they have the default female character of Ark model.
01:46:10 They're Nami types.
01:46:11 Have I shown you my one piece girl types chart that I made?
01:46:17 I know, maybe. Let me see this.
01:46:19 This might be funny to post.
01:46:20 I mean, when you say chart, you mean like two?
01:46:23 Like they're either Nami.
01:46:25 No, they're ridiculously exaggerated.
01:46:28 There's Nami types, there's Robin types, and there's aberrants.
01:46:31 And here is it. Here is the fact that I made.
01:46:35 Of these, and then there's subtypes within them.
01:46:40 Almost all Robin are in the lip subtype.
01:46:44 Interesting fact, almost all Robin subtypes are in the lip subtype.
01:46:50 I can't remember why I made this.
01:46:51 I think I was just very tired and thinking about it.
01:46:53 And I was like, yeah, why not?
01:46:55 Ugly subtype.
01:46:57 OK, OK.
01:46:59 My criticism is the only difference
01:47:01 between Nami types and Robin types is the hair color.
01:47:04 Yeah, looking at it now.
01:47:09 There's a there's a difference with the eyes as well.
01:47:11 The eyes are a lot rounder on Nami types, I feel like.
01:47:14 In my opinion, maybe on some of these.
01:47:18 They usually like Robin and Hancock have like slanted
01:47:22 downwards eyes on the outside.
01:47:24 It's like they I'll be honest.
01:47:25 I didn't know that Robin and Hancock were different characters.
01:47:27 I know. I know what you mean.
01:47:30 Until I see the names, like I forget.
01:47:32 I really don't.
01:47:34 OK, I can tell I'm only three minutes in to Nate's lecture.
01:47:38 Wait.
01:47:39 I OK, I'm trying to identify.
01:47:43 OK, there's some.
01:47:44 There's two that you won't know because of one, three.
01:47:47 OK, several of these I genuinely can't tell aren't just Robin and Nami.
01:47:52 OK, OK, I see Shira Hoshi.
01:47:55 I don't know the girl with the horns.
01:47:57 I know the bunny girl.
01:48:00 Who I don't know who that chef is.
01:48:02 I guess she's just some rando from a whole cake.
01:48:04 Is that that's pudding?
01:48:05 Yeah, that's pudding.
01:48:06 Why is she dressed like a chef?
01:48:08 Because it's when they make the wedding cake.
01:48:11 Oh, because she goes crazy.
01:48:14 Is that a is that a mermaid that last
01:48:15 is an unusual outfit for her?
01:48:17 That's camey the mermaid.
01:48:19 Yeah. OK.
01:48:20 And then they're OK.
01:48:21 I see in the Robin types,
01:48:23 I see there's the the smokers assistant lady.
01:48:26 Tashige. Yeah.
01:48:28 Tashige, Boa Hancock.
01:48:29 I don't know the next two.
01:48:32 And those are those different characters, Ben, those two there.
01:48:37 Yeah, are they? OK.
01:48:39 And then the one with the mask is one of the
01:48:42 Oh, fuck, what are they called?
01:48:44 The ones that they fight in the dress.
01:48:46 Rosa in Alibaba.
01:48:47 No, in alabaster. No, no, no, no, no, no.
01:48:51 Not to press Rosa, Ben.
01:48:53 Really? She's like she baby five.
01:48:56 Is that her name?
01:48:56 That's baby five.
01:48:57 She's the one that turns her body into guns.
01:48:59 And she's she has a devil fruit turns her body into weapons.
01:49:04 Yeah, OK. What was I what am I thinking of?
01:49:05 What's the what's Crocodile's organization called?
01:49:09 But the Baroque works.
01:49:11 Yeah, I thought she was a Baroque works girl.
01:49:13 But no, OK.
01:49:14 She's yeah, you're right.
01:49:16 And then the last one.
01:49:18 Oh, the last one is that one that
01:49:19 Sanji like falls in love with in dress Rosa.
01:49:22 What's your name?
01:49:23 Violet. Yes.
01:49:25 Yeah.
01:49:27 Best, best, best one.
01:49:28 Best one piece girl is Perona.
01:49:30 There's no.
01:49:31 I would have thought Perona would be yours.
01:49:33 Yeah, well, it's true.
01:49:35 It's true. She's one of the funny eyeballs.
01:49:38 But the round the really round.
01:49:41 Yeah, that's that's Perona with the big hat.
01:49:43 That's Perona. Yeah, pink hair.
01:49:44 The one the one to her right is my favorite.
01:49:47 Sanderson. Oh, Sandersonia.
01:49:49 Yeah, I drew her.
01:49:50 I just really like her wide face.
01:49:53 Yeah, that makes that makes sense.
01:49:56 That makes total sense.
01:49:57 Sandersonia.
01:49:58 I really, I really like this.
01:50:00 This this Ukiyo a like side view Japanese looking one.
01:50:05 She's one of my favorite designs.
01:50:06 She's awesome.
01:50:07 Actually, I really I also really like
01:50:10 Shirahoshi's mom.
01:50:12 What's what's her name?
01:50:13 Otohime. Yeah, I think she's one of my favorite signs.
01:50:16 Otohime is is one of the best ones.
01:50:18 Yeah. Yeah.
01:50:20 So Yoda can do it sometimes.
01:50:22 He just likes to default to the simple ones.
01:50:23 He just he just likes drawing
01:50:27 like this a circle head with facial features that are the same.
01:50:32 These ones that are different are actually they're actually good.
01:50:35 Who's this one with the blonde hair in the glasses?
01:50:37 Is that a CP nine?
01:50:39 Yeah, no, that's yeah.
01:50:40 That's Khalifa.
01:50:42 Yeah, I think the name's not sheep.
01:50:44 The the the the bubble, the soap one.
01:50:47 Yes, what not me?
01:50:48 Yes, yes, I remember.
01:50:51 I don't recognize this like snake looking one,
01:50:55 even with the chopsticks.
01:50:56 Is she a wano girl?
01:50:57 No, she's from Fishman Island.
01:50:58 She's the prophecy lady.
01:51:00 Oh, yeah.
01:51:01 Yeah, I'm Shirley.
01:51:02 Yeah, yeah, Charlie.
01:51:04 Yeah, OK, I remember.
01:51:06 OK, well, I kind of know that stuff.
01:51:10 You know most of them, Ben.
01:51:11 Fine, I know most of them.
01:51:12 That's pretty good.
01:51:14 Rebecca right there looks like so non-distinct,
01:51:18 even amongst the nami types.
01:51:20 Yeah, Otohime would be played by Helena Bonham Carter.
01:51:25 Yes, true.
01:51:27 Yeah.
01:51:30 Actually, you know what?
01:51:30 That makes me like her less.
01:51:31 No, Charlie would be.
01:51:33 Charlie would be.
01:51:35 Oh, is it because like Otohime has like mascara or like eyeshadow?
01:51:40 I think it's it's like kind of kind of her like rectangular head.
01:51:44 And big lips and big lips and Otohime.
01:51:47 Well, it's not rectangular, but she's like a wide set head and wide jaw.
01:51:51 I don't know.
01:51:52 What a good design.
01:51:53 Cute, cute, so cute.
01:51:55 I love God bless.
01:51:59 God bless.
01:52:00 Oblivion for read one piece.
01:52:01 You'll like it.
01:52:02 God bless everyone.
01:52:03 Never have something else to do first.
01:52:07 No, Bummer.
01:52:09 You're missing out on some very funny character designs.
01:52:13 Very funny character designs.
01:52:14 I still gotta finish watching Detective Conan
01:52:16 and then that's like a number of five hundred episodes
01:52:19 and I've already watched five hundred episodes.
01:52:21 How could you not get tired of Detective Conan?
01:52:25 I like it.
01:52:26 That's the it's it's detected.
01:52:27 And I guess it's like if you like detective little mini stories
01:52:31 of one after the other.
01:52:32 The mystery is a lot of them are really, really, really, really fucking clever.
01:52:36 And I'm like, damn, I want to commit a murder now.
01:52:38 I read like a bunch of like a hundred or so a bunch of chapters.
01:52:43 I don't know how many chapters I read, but I was like,
01:52:46 OK, you you grabbed me with this initial mystery
01:52:49 and I enjoy these side mysteries that are just sort of like Detective Conan
01:52:53 solving a mystery, but I don't like that you've decided to pretend
01:52:57 to string me along with an answer to this bigger mystery about
01:53:00 who's behind turning him into a small child,
01:53:03 because I know you're never going to do it.
01:53:05 You just fucking lied to me and I got a mad.
01:53:07 No, this this this being this being some like big ass fucking things
01:53:11 that have happened that just really spread out.
01:53:14 And there's wait, like recently, well, no, like around episode
01:53:18 five hundred of the show, at least, and I think around episode 128.
01:53:25 There's been a few points where like they've revealed some big stuff
01:53:27 and there's been big plot things.
01:53:28 There is a lot of filler and a lot of the filler is good,
01:53:31 but some of it is kind of boring.
01:53:32 I feel like like Detective Conan would be more enjoyable
01:53:37 if it was just this is a young kid who's really good at detective work.
01:53:43 And here's like a serial of him doing detectives things.
01:53:51 And every week, there's a new every episode, there's a new mystery.
01:53:54 Oh, and it's fun.
01:53:57 Simsie, who is this?
01:53:58 It's Charlotte Amanda from One Piece, one of Big Mom's daughters
01:54:01 who doesn't really do anything, but she's great.
01:54:03 She. Yeah, she's got the best.
01:54:04 Like I got a huge part giraffe.
01:54:06 You is that you're drawing Simsie?
01:54:08 Yes.
01:54:09 She drew her hat way too small.
01:54:11 That hat is like, I know.
01:54:15 The next one is not long enough.
01:54:17 What's her name?
01:54:18 Amanda, like Amanda, not the best design.
01:54:24 Yeah.
01:54:25 She literal T pose woman.
01:54:28 Charlotte Amanda, Amanda, I see face.
01:54:32 Oh, my God.
01:54:33 It's such a funny image.
01:54:35 She looks way better in your drawing in real life.
01:54:39 No, she's a lamp face.
01:54:41 Oh, you know what?
01:54:41 Actually, she's got like a bowling pin head.
01:54:44 Actually, when you see her, her like full body.
01:54:48 OK, this is this.
01:54:49 She looks cool here.
01:54:53 Oh, you already are.
01:54:54 You already posted it.
01:54:55 OK, yeah, she looks.
01:54:57 OK, I get it.
01:54:58 I get it. She's sick.
01:55:00 Shut up.
01:55:01 What's this? OK.
01:55:02 All right. All right.
01:55:03 This is awesome.
01:55:04 All right. One piece kind of good.
01:55:08 Does she really?
01:55:09 She doesn't like fight or anything?
01:55:11 No, she she makes sticky and then steal something out of her tits.
01:55:15 I remember that.
01:55:18 There was like a there's so many good character designs.
01:55:20 There's not time for them all to do some cool.
01:55:22 Yeah. And in whole cake, I remember, there was like, here's.
01:55:27 Well, here's a big mom's crew.
01:55:31 There's so many people in it, and it's an unwinnable situation.
01:55:34 We have to get the fuck out of here.
01:55:36 So they couldn't.
01:55:37 It wasn't really like a let's defeat all of these people in turn.
01:55:40 It's here's too many people.
01:55:41 We got it. We can't defeat them.
01:55:43 So they didn't actually get to do much.
01:55:45 And they're all perfect.
01:55:47 They just got to stand there and look cool.
01:55:49 And it's scary.
01:55:50 They're just flexing a whole room of like any one of these could be
01:55:54 look could have like a whole like side arc devoted to them
01:55:56 if I felt like it, but I don't fuck it.
01:55:58 Let's move on.
01:56:00 It's such wrong.
01:56:02 What a good design.
01:56:04 There's just too many.
01:56:05 That's just like how he draws like fat ladies.
01:56:08 I don't know why they're really funny.
01:56:10 They are funny.
01:56:14 That's funny.
01:56:16 These are this makes me this this makes me happy.
01:56:19 This brings us this brings a smile to my face.
01:56:22 This whole.
01:56:23 Oh, it's like about one face.
01:56:29 A smoothie.
01:56:30 Smoothies pretty good. Yeah.
01:56:32 I tried drawing once it was pretty bad.
01:56:35 Oh, in the anime, she.
01:56:37 All right, this image is funny.
01:56:40 But I remember in the.
01:56:43 In the manga, those are like when she was introduced.
01:56:48 There was like a picture of her sitting down.
01:56:51 I remember her and like the angle of it was like really cool.
01:56:54 But when she stands up, her legs are a little little ridiculous looking.
01:56:58 Hang on.
01:56:59 I found the panel, I think.
01:57:01 Oh, I'm such a good.
01:57:02 Where are her knees?
01:57:03 Are they like in the little bulby part or the?
01:57:05 Yeah, they're just like right at the.
01:57:07 Yeah, look at them legs and look at that that wine glass.
01:57:10 That's what I love.
01:57:11 That's a big wine.
01:57:13 Swishin, it's swishin.
01:57:15 Oh, yeah.
01:57:16 You were earlier with your assumption that like any one of the
01:57:20 the Charlotte family could be the main villain of another one piece arc.
01:57:24 Like, in terms of how well designed they are, they're great.
01:57:27 They're so good.
01:57:28 Yeah, they're awesome.
01:57:30 Fuck yeah, they better come back in spades.
01:57:34 There's just not time.
01:57:36 But I think there's time for at least like smoothie to do something.
01:57:40 At least two of them have come back.
01:57:42 She's like third or fourth in command or something.
01:57:46 Quite high up there.
01:57:48 She's the I.
01:57:49 I feel like at some point we tipped over into like a critical.
01:57:54 Zone like a tipping point was reached where in like new like awesome characters
01:57:59 or just like every chapter, there's like a big splash page of like,
01:58:02 oh, here's a new guy with the coolest character design you've ever seen.
01:58:06 Yeah, it's it's it's it has to happen because like the idea that a new crew
01:58:12 that you've heard about and that is like unparalleled power in the seas
01:58:17 would not have a wacky large crew like other smaller crews that you like
01:58:22 the one the store have parts have defeated before.
01:58:25 They've got to have a big crazy crew with the kooky characters.
01:58:28 Just they can't have just jobbers.
01:58:30 Yeah, you're you're right.
01:58:32 Think think back to like what like the pirate crew has looked like
01:58:36 with like back when like Alveda and buggy and like East Blue,
01:58:40 like the very like guys with like striped shirts and glasses.
01:58:43 Like they had like maybe maybe five named characters
01:58:47 that had their abilities and they were like in command.
01:58:50 And then there was the the crewmates,
01:58:52 just the people who would roll barrels and yell.
01:58:55 Yeah, just some dudes, just some dudes.
01:58:59 They even had to do that to the Marines,
01:59:02 because like Marines in the New World, they can't just be like
01:59:06 skinny twinks with a with a rifle.
01:59:09 They've got to be like meaty gorilla brutes with with all of these
01:59:13 like like bazookas and like double bazookas in each hand.
01:59:16 It's like they've got to they've got to wear like big fur collars
01:59:19 and like, you know, have like big, I don't know,
01:59:23 gold boots or whatever and like crazy facial hair.
01:59:26 We've got to have something.
01:59:27 We've gone from like buggy, second in command,
01:59:29 being just a guy who tames lions to like an entire family
01:59:33 of crazy devil fruit piracy is that all themed around sweets
01:59:38 and very sizes. Oh, my God.
01:59:41 It's inspiring.
01:59:42 And I is.
01:59:43 Is that that guy in the far right?
01:59:45 Is he is he in one of the crews?
01:59:50 Well, the egg man Tom ago, that's Tom ago from from a
01:59:55 he's in like the Beast Pirates, right?
01:59:57 No, I don't think so.
01:59:59 No, he's a big mum pirate guy.
02:00:01 OK, but who am I thinking of?
02:00:02 There's there's another egg guy named Tom ago who's in the Beast Pirates.
02:00:07 Is there? Yeah.
02:00:09 Are you sure you're not confusing him?
02:00:11 Because you meet we meet him before we go to Whole Cake is
02:00:15 we meet him in Fishman Island.
02:00:16 He and Peckons are just hanging out.
02:00:20 And they're thinking of an egg shaped man from one
02:00:22 local queen. No.
02:00:25 OK, this is no, this is the guy.
02:00:27 This is Tom ago.
02:00:29 Oh, I guess he is part of the big mom.
02:00:32 Oh, I thought I thought he was in the Beast Men.
02:00:35 No. Oh, well, well, well, you misunderstood.
02:00:38 I guess I misunderstood.
02:00:42 Bomber. Well, actually, it's fine.
02:00:45 It's fine either way.
02:00:46 This is wacky.
02:00:47 What's wrong with living full?
02:00:48 That's why it's wacky.
02:00:50 There is an unlimited wank.
02:00:55 Yeah, no, but it's wacky, but also it'll make you cry your fucking little nuts off.
02:00:59 This is good.
02:01:00 It's it's it's the my favorite thing.
02:01:02 It's like he he has these ideas for these designs.
02:01:07 They're so simplistic in in aspects of like,
02:01:12 what if there was a guy who was just a circle?
02:01:14 You know, like that that's the the character design.
02:01:17 But then on top of that, he has details.
02:01:19 He gives them personality quirks.
02:01:22 And then, you know, someone like
02:01:25 Waltz's face in Dressroser, famous example.
02:01:30 For baby boy. Oh, yeah.
02:01:32 The baby boy.
02:01:34 He's a boy. He's a man who's like a cool macho man.
02:01:38 I don't remember his name.
02:01:39 And he yeah, Senor Pink. Oh, Senor Pink.
02:01:41 Yeah. Yes.
02:01:42 Senor Pink, he dresses up as a big baby with a bonnet guy.
02:01:46 He's like a cool guy, like mafia boss with like a
02:01:49 cadre, he's like a harem of like hot girls that are just like
02:01:52 following around everywhere.
02:01:53 Rips girls bras off and wipes his face with them when he gets sweaty.
02:01:56 And then just throwing away.
02:01:58 Yeah, he's like it's like a complete insane parody of like,
02:02:01 what the fuck's kind of guy is this?
02:02:03 And then because of that, it's the most funny thing to do would be
02:02:08 to give him a heart wrenching backstory to explain why he dresses up in a diaper.
02:02:14 And it's like, it's his, it's because his wife,
02:02:19 I can't remember the exact details, but his wife was like dying
02:02:22 and their their child had died and he dressed up as a baby
02:02:29 to pretend to be their dead child to cheer her up in her final days.
02:02:34 Yeah, his wife went crazy and couldn't like emote anymore
02:02:38 unless he dressed up as a big baby and reminded them of the kid.
02:02:42 Yeah, and so she she she she managed to smile again
02:02:47 because he dressed like a baby, but then eventually she died as well.
02:02:50 And so to honor her memory, he still dresses as a baby.
02:02:53 And it's like it's so heartfelt.
02:02:55 Everyone cries. It's great.
02:02:58 I literally like I was talking about one piece of my friend the other day
02:03:00 and he was like, oh, this in your pink guy seems kind of lame.
02:03:03 And I said to him, I was like, that's legit.
02:03:04 One of the best characters in one piece.
02:03:06 And then two weeks later, when he'd seen his backstory, he came back to
02:03:09 like, you're completely right.
02:03:12 It's just that's that's the vibe.
02:03:14 It's like, what's the most ridiculous thing we could do
02:03:17 and do it as seriously as possible?
02:03:19 Do it seriously and just good as possible. Yeah.
02:03:24 Well, I'm feeling overwhelmed by my feel
02:03:26 and by my by good one piece feelings.
02:03:29 I'm just staring at the size
02:03:30 comparison chart and thinking about attack on Titan.
02:03:33 Yeah.
02:03:35 I'm thinking of them in their little puppet walking animations.
02:03:39 Yes. Why is that fat woman so big?
02:03:42 Why is she big?
02:03:42 That's big mom.
02:03:43 She's just big.
02:03:45 She's that big because she's big mom.
02:03:47 You idiot.
02:03:49 Why else?
02:03:52 Don't call her that fat woman.
02:03:53 That's big mom.
02:03:55 That's a young girl, big mom.
02:03:57 You big mom.
02:03:58 Don't you know what that means?
02:03:59 You're full.
02:04:01 I'm a fool.
02:04:02 I mean, Katakuri is so fucking big.
02:04:04 Katakuri is that big.
02:04:06 Yeah. Katakuri is that big.
02:04:08 You don't realize it when you're like reading it.
02:04:10 But when I know, like, I thought he was like, you know, tall.
02:04:14 I thought he was maybe like twice as tall as Luffy.
02:04:16 No, I don't realize he's like 40 feet tall.
02:04:19 It's because Luffy gets really big when he's in that form that he uses.
02:04:25 If he gets at least twice as big when he's in Snake Man, I think it's called.
02:04:29 But Katakuri is a big boy.
02:04:32 All right, that kind of that kind of makes up that kind of explains it.
02:04:35 Yeah. Oh, and there's the panel.
02:04:37 It's hard to tell in some of the the manga panels, because like in the big
02:04:41 mom parts, there are quite a lot of people who are just very big.
02:04:45 It's like sometimes it doesn't you can't really get a sense of how big he is
02:04:49 in comparison to like the generic human actual size.
02:04:53 It's almost where Luffy is.
02:04:55 It almost feels like Oda just wanted to like cram so much personality
02:05:01 into all of his side characters that you just had to keep making them bigger
02:05:04 and bigger because it just wouldn't fit otherwise.
02:05:06 So true. Yeah.
02:05:10 It's because because they have to they wouldn't fit on the screen.
02:05:13 They wouldn't fit in the panel because they have to stand up behind
02:05:16 the other guys so you can see them all.
02:05:17 Yeah, they said he needs to get progressively bigger.
02:05:21 Yeah, depending on how important they are.
02:05:23 I almost think that like that might be it.
02:05:25 Like he just wants to like have like big people so you can see them all in a crowd
02:05:29 shot. I don't know.
02:05:31 That's why Franky got big.
02:05:34 Yeah. Yeah, pretty sure that's why you did it is just so that you could
02:05:37 add Frankie in the background of Straw Hat panels and still see him.
02:05:41 Oh, you mean after you mean after the timescale?
02:05:43 Yeah, because you know, you got like four times bigger.
02:05:44 I'm pretty sure you did that intentionally so that Franky could be the background one.
02:05:48 Well, good. It was the right move.
02:05:50 It works, but he's still he's still good.
02:05:53 He's he's all right.
02:05:54 I still prefer the Popeye arms to what he has now.
02:05:59 Yeah, I can see both.
02:06:00 It's a little busy right now.
02:06:02 It's it's the only thing he keeps getting busy and busier.
02:06:08 I mean, I mean, yeah, they all do.
02:06:10 Like Brooks outfits and stuff.
02:06:13 Yeah, that's true.
02:06:15 They did like it's not so bad.
02:06:17 He's he wore that feather boa and that crown for a while,
02:06:19 but he hasn't done it in Wano, I don't think.
02:06:23 No, in Wano, he was in the ghost disguise most of the time.
02:06:26 It's good.
02:06:28 God, one piece kind of cool.
02:06:30 No, I can't know what I know.
02:06:31 I want to catch up.
02:06:32 Yeah, so I'm suddenly feeling inspired to catch up.
02:06:36 No, I can't know.
02:06:37 I know I got to draw.
02:06:38 I got to draw my fucking comic.
02:06:40 You got to draw my stupid ass comic and then read and then maybe read.
02:06:43 Four times a night before bed.
02:06:47 No, I want to read it all at once.
02:06:49 OK, there's no point.
02:06:51 But then you can talk about it weekly in a segment on maybe on
02:06:55 twitch.tv or on this podcast, I guess I could do that.
02:07:03 I don't know. I'll do it.
02:07:05 I'll do it. I'll I'll do it.
02:07:08 It worked. I finally we finally convinced them.
02:07:11 We finally did it.
02:07:12 Maybe as soon as you catch up, you'll fall off right again.
02:07:16 Well, probably, yeah, conversing pirates.
02:07:20 Yeah, we'll call it one piece of my mind.
02:07:23 I can't remember who said that.
02:07:24 I think it was crack.
02:07:24 I think it was crack is one piece of my mind.
02:07:26 Terrible, terrible title.
02:07:28 I hate it. No, that's perfect.
02:07:29 We've got to use it. I don't like it.
02:07:35 Well, I have I have nothing else to say about one piece other than that.
02:07:38 It's good and I like it.
02:07:39 Oh, OK.
02:07:41 Now I see this final panel of Katakuri on the holy shit.
02:07:44 He's a big boy.
02:07:45 That's fucked.
02:07:46 He's a big gentleman.
02:07:47 So you can you can live in his shoe than many of the Titans.
02:07:51 He genuinely is.
02:07:54 Yeah, OK.
02:07:55 You have a band.
02:07:55 It makes him look strong.
02:07:57 I it sure does.
02:08:00 It sure does.
02:08:03 And it makes it funny when you find that he likes doughnuts.
02:08:06 I'll give you a toilet.
02:08:08 They just use the ocean.
02:08:10 They've got all of these different sized people.
02:08:12 And when they go to the bathroom, we never see that.
02:08:14 Everybody has like six or seven different rooms.
02:08:18 That's why the Seekings are so pissed off
02:08:20 is because they're constantly eating people shit.
02:08:22 And they're not happy about it.
02:08:23 People just keep getting bigger and bigger.
02:08:25 And the poo just just keeps being more and more poo in the ocean.
02:08:29 And they can't damn.
02:08:30 They can't fucking take it anymore.
02:08:33 So they eat people.
02:08:35 Yeah, yeah.
02:08:37 People have to decide them, though.
02:08:38 It doesn't really solve the problem, does it?
02:08:41 All right, you got to you got to cut it off at the source.
02:08:42 It's worth eating a little bit of poo now to avoid eating more.
02:08:49 It's a it's a simple cost-benefit analysis
02:08:52 that the Seekings has performed to decide that eating people
02:08:54 poo and all is the is the best solution.
02:08:59 Yeah, yeah.
02:09:01 Imagine imagine being an animal
02:09:03 and killing and eating another animal and you're eating them
02:09:05 and you take a big bite of their large intestine
02:09:07 and just poo just starts flowing out just into your mouth.
02:09:11 Delicious, my favorite.
02:09:13 Do do they just not I do they just not eat that part?
02:09:17 I think they mostly don't care or they eat around it.
02:09:21 I mean, dogs eat shit sometimes because they're really idiots.
02:09:25 Yeah, they just see shit and they're like, oh, look, that's something.
02:09:29 It's something. I got to eat it.
02:09:31 I feel like maybe do you do like lie like a lion kills a gazelle?
02:09:34 I can't imagine that like one like like all the lion pack
02:09:38 like jump on the gazelle and they're all tearing bits off of it.
02:09:41 And then one lion is like, oh, well,
02:09:43 I guess my part is the large intestine.
02:09:45 Oh, it's got poo in it, though.
02:09:46 But I just got to eat it while you shit yourself when you die as a courtesy.
02:09:51 Get it out of there.
02:09:53 I hope that's that's literally what happens.
02:09:56 It's a nature solution.
02:09:58 I don't do, dude.
02:09:59 Now I believe Jesus absolutely is correct.
02:10:03 Why? Why?
02:10:05 Because he's a lion.
02:10:06 And he eats people.
02:10:08 From now, I can't think of an evolutionary benefit to shitting
02:10:11 when you die other than to make other animals happy,
02:10:13 which means it had just like this.
02:10:15 I am is correct.
02:10:16 That's for proof.
02:10:17 That's what Jesus said of the Sermon on the Mount.
02:10:19 He said, blessed are the meek.
02:10:21 And also, you know, it's kind of good that when you shit yourself in the back.
02:10:26 They left that pile because everyone was like, that was a weird.
02:10:28 I don't know what I'm going to write that one down.
02:10:34 Lost the time, but it did happen.
02:10:37 It got it got everyone on his side, but they all agreed like,
02:10:40 you know, future generations probably don't need to hear that.
02:10:42 They hated him for he spoke the truth.
02:10:44 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:10:47 Thank you Jesus.
02:10:49 Thanks. Thank you. Thank you.
02:10:52 That's all for me.
02:10:56 That's all for that's all for me, too.
02:10:58 I don't know anything else.
02:11:02 We could we could start voicemails now.
02:11:04 We have a lot of voicemails, actually.
02:11:06 Like we should probably get through them
02:11:08 because I don't think I can stick around too much longer.
02:11:10 OK, sure. Well, let's let's let's start that out.
02:11:13 We'll try and I don't know why we got so many.
02:11:17 It's crazy.
02:11:18 Was it the big stuff?
02:11:20 People want to talk about that, I guess.
02:11:22 Uh, it doesn't really look like it.
02:11:28 Maybe maybe we wanted to the stuff happened that I didn't hear about.
02:11:32 A little bit, a little bit.
02:11:35 Nothing interesting, nothing.
02:11:36 Because it's big stuff.
02:11:38 Yeah, I mean, true.
02:11:40 OK, OK, so here we got one.
02:11:41 This is called this is called Red Five Rainbow.
02:11:46 Put it in the general.
02:11:49 There we go. OK, three, two, one, go.
02:11:53 One of my classes this semester requires me to use Proctorio
02:11:57 whenever I take an exam.
02:11:58 And what that is is basically a software
02:12:00 that records me through my webcam and records my computer screen
02:12:04 the whole time I'm taking the exam.
02:12:05 And it has an AI to analyze
02:12:07 whenever I'm doing suspicious behavior to make sure that I don't cheat.
02:12:12 Can we talk about how that's fucked?
02:12:14 Suspicious behavior.
02:12:16 That's literally 1984.
02:12:18 Probably like looking.
02:12:21 Probably like looking, looking like off your desk or something,
02:12:23 looking at your phone.
02:12:26 Dude, yeah, that's fucked.
02:12:28 I had to use someone.
02:12:30 I forget who they are, but they worked from home
02:12:32 and they had to have a software installed.
02:12:35 They had to like basically have like OBS or something
02:12:38 like recording their entire screen like one of my old one of my old roommates
02:12:42 had he would have to take tests online.
02:12:45 And yeah, there would be a Proctorio that would be like watching him
02:12:47 through a webcam to make sure he wasn't doing any weird shit.
02:12:51 You know, this wasn't even test.
02:12:52 This was like a worker like at a company who was working from home
02:12:56 and they recorded their screen out eight hours a day
02:12:57 just to make sure that they weren't slacking off.
02:13:01 Jesus, my friend had that where
02:13:03 but they would also check his like internet history on the laptop
02:13:05 because he had to work from this laptop from home
02:13:07 and then turn it in every now and then.
02:13:09 Because I think he did like online programming and stuff.
02:13:11 And he specifically, I specifically know this
02:13:14 because he was watching Gundam and he could only watch the ones that were on YouTube
02:13:18 because he couldn't go on any piracy websites or anything.
02:13:21 So we have to wait fucking months for it to come out
02:13:23 on some weird streaming service here.
02:13:25 And it was very strange.
02:13:26 I saw that I use VPN.
02:13:29 I saw that the SATs are going like all online or something.
02:13:35 That's weird.
02:13:36 I guess they're probably going to do the same thing.
02:13:38 Use some weird software.
02:13:39 I bet I bet it'll still be possible to cheat.
02:13:41 I mean, I guess you could cheat the in-person version as well.
02:13:44 They won't in England.
02:13:45 Ha, ha, why not?
02:13:47 Because they're giving up on all COVID restrictions, aren't they?
02:13:51 Oh, yeah, they're going back in.
02:13:54 Yeah, I don't I'm not paying attention to that.
02:13:56 It's just like a yes or no to everything possible
02:14:00 that you could or could not be doing.
02:14:02 Please do or do not do everything.
02:14:03 It's like, I don't know.
02:14:04 I'll just wear a mask.
02:14:05 Yeah, I'll just wear a mask and I'll just go outside.
02:14:07 If there's no legal requirement to wear a mask anymore,
02:14:10 there's no legal requirement to work from home or any of that shit.
02:14:13 There's nothing, basically.
02:14:15 There's no restrictions anymore.
02:14:16 Damn, I think it's just the NHS are going to start firing people
02:14:20 who aren't vaccinated or something like that.
02:14:22 That's the only one that's sticking around.
02:14:23 Something, something, I guess.
02:14:25 Yeah, take what I can get.
02:14:28 I guess Boris, my the lawsuit against the New Zealand government
02:14:33 that my mum is involved with.
02:14:37 As there was a little thing written about it recently.
02:14:42 It's a COVID restriction thing, right?
02:14:44 Yeah, but churches.
02:14:47 Why do I why do I have to? Oh, yeah, that whole thing.
02:14:53 All right, I think the next one might be the same one again,
02:14:57 because there's another one called Red Five.
02:15:01 Three, two, one, go.
02:15:04 Oh, my gosh, I already left this as a comment on the last episode.
02:15:07 No, different, OK, probably two episodes ago once you hear this.
02:15:11 But for wordle, it's based off of your system time.
02:15:15 So if you just like set your date to a different date,
02:15:18 it will give you a wordle for that day.
02:15:21 So you can play the past wordles.
02:15:22 You can play some future wordles, too.
02:15:24 Hmm, really? Wacky.
02:15:26 You could go you could go and just play future ones
02:15:28 that no one has seen before.
02:15:30 You could go and spoil all future wordles.
02:15:33 That's interesting, because the timer when it reset
02:15:36 seems to be based off like UK time, because it like it resets like
02:15:40 at like nine p.m. for me, which would be for me.
02:15:44 It resets at midnight.
02:15:46 Yeah, I thought it was like midnight wherever you are.
02:15:49 It's not midnight for me.
02:15:50 Like it seems to if I check.
02:15:54 If I check wordle, when's the next one?
02:15:57 Every everybody else.
02:15:58 Everybody else seems to reset at midnight.
02:16:00 Oh, wait, no, now it's now it's set to midnight.
02:16:03 That's weird. The other day, like I was able to like access a new one
02:16:05 like like five or six hours before midnight,
02:16:09 which would have lined up with the UK. That's pretty weird.
02:16:12 Never. Maybe they recently changed the system time
02:16:15 because of the popularity.
02:16:17 Maybe or or I'm stupid.
02:16:22 Nakes. OK, next one is please tell me this is in the Blu-rays.
02:16:27 And then there's a YouTube link.
02:16:30 That is not a YouTube link.
02:16:31 This is not a YouTube link.
02:16:33 That is not a note.
02:16:34 Yeah, this video isn't of it.
02:16:36 Yeah, yeah. No, here's what fucking happened.
02:16:38 They pasted the link and didn't notice that their their voicemail title
02:16:42 was too long and it only put part of the link there.
02:16:46 I feel like I feel like this happens all the time.
02:16:48 I feel like this happens very often.
02:16:51 I am going to I'm going to assume this is a Jesse video
02:16:55 and I'm going to look at the URL that has 69 Q in it.
02:16:59 I have I have a I have a guess for what this might be.
02:17:04 Is it is it that one Jesse video that went viral recently?
02:17:07 Wait, one went viral recently.
02:17:09 Yeah, there was one going the the Windows updates one was like
02:17:14 it went viral on TikTok recently.
02:17:17 It went viral. You made me a racist, Obama, you made me a racist.
02:17:23 As long as I kept that part in and good, I guess,
02:17:25 because when it went viral on Facebook, if I cut that part off.
02:17:29 So just ended with the N word without the the dawning horror
02:17:32 that they have become a racist now.
02:17:34 That would that's the punchline.
02:17:36 Yeah, that's pretty much ruin the whole point of the of the bit.
02:17:40 Yeah.
02:17:42 It's like I hate Windows update so much that I became racist about it.
02:17:47 But there's a way it doesn't work if it doesn't work
02:17:49 if if you if you omit the self-awareness of I guess.
02:17:53 I guess it would be funny in a different way
02:17:55 if you just cut it off after the N word.
02:17:58 But like it's like then it becomes like a crazy person yelling.
02:18:03 Yeah, that's all shock value, which is funny in its own way.
02:18:05 But like, yeah, then you just think it's just a person who's.
02:18:09 Yes, that's why it went viral.
02:18:12 Well, well, no, yeah, that's that sucks.
02:18:17 All right, next next one is a is a vocabru.
02:18:22 Is a vocabru link, I guess.
02:18:24 So let's let's check. Let's check it out.
02:18:28 Wait, oblivion fall. What are you?
02:18:30 What are you?
02:18:30 I am I am doing some I'm doing some detective work detective work.
02:18:37 Yeah, so with YouTube videos.
02:18:42 You I learned this from Vsauce.
02:18:44 You can search for videos based on what the URL is.
02:18:48 So I can search for a YouTube URL that has that in it.
02:18:54 And hopefully.
02:18:57 Oh, wow.
02:19:01 OK, I'm getting a few videos with this.
02:19:04 Oh, no, it's not case sensitive.
02:19:06 This is just a Minecraft video.
02:19:09 I know there's only three letters that's not enough if we had four, maybe.
02:19:13 Well, well, we'll never know.
02:19:15 You done fucked up, voicemailer.
02:19:16 You done fucked it up.
02:19:20 All right, next next one is this vocabru link.
02:19:23 All right, I'm looking on it.
02:19:24 I got it. Three, two, three, two, one, go.
02:19:50 I couldn't understand it.
02:19:51 No, I don't know what I said.
02:19:53 I couldn't understand a single word.
02:19:54 I have no idea what they said.
02:19:55 Sorry. Good try.
02:19:57 Good try.
02:19:58 Sounded cool.
02:19:59 Sounded nice.
02:19:59 And credits of Red Dead Redemption 2 or something,
02:20:01 but I did no idea what that said.
02:20:06 It's too bad.
02:20:08 Next one is.
02:20:12 It's OK, parentheses.
02:20:14 It's a cover.
02:20:14 It's called It's a Cover of a Song Called Nightfall at Runescape is Fucking
02:20:18 based, whatever, whatever.
02:20:21 OK.
02:20:23 Next one is Shraft, Shraft 3.0.
02:20:30 OK, there it is.
02:20:32 Three, two, one, go.
02:20:35 Hey, PZP, two questions.
02:20:38 Well, really one question, but in the form of two,
02:20:41 because I'm that much of an asshole.
02:20:43 So the internet, it's constantly changing.
02:20:47 It's, you know, the internet of 10 years ago is gone
02:20:51 and the internet of 10 years from now is what I'm about to ask you about.
02:20:55 So what do you think the internet is going to look like in 10 years from now?
02:20:59 What are going to be the hot trends?
02:21:01 What's what's everyone going to be chasing for cloud?
02:21:03 What kind of rat race are we going to be stuck in?
02:21:07 And secondarily, what type of internet would you like to see in 10 years?
02:21:11 What would be a good internet?
02:21:13 And don't fucking.
02:21:15 OK, this is an obvious like trash web 3.0 shit.
02:21:19 But like, let's say let's say fucking
02:21:23 the crypto bros don't get their way.
02:21:25 What what what do you think would happen maybe outside of that?
02:21:28 So be more creative, you fucks.
02:21:30 Well, that's too that's too broad a question.
02:21:33 Oh, I have no I have no idea.
02:21:34 I mean, 10 years ago, the internet was like
02:21:39 slowly becoming exactly what it is now,
02:21:43 which is just sort of whatever.
02:21:48 Content, content for the viewing public, the masses, social media.
02:21:52 I feel like it's going to be the same for the next 10 years.
02:21:54 I feel like it was leading up to this and I can't see it like changing anymore.
02:22:00 Well, what I want is a gallery.
02:22:01 A few years anyway, all I want is a proper gallery mode on Twitter.
02:22:04 That's all I need.
02:22:05 It goes month or maybe every media post.
02:22:07 That's all OK.
02:22:10 So the last like 10 years has seen like consolidation of content into like
02:22:15 what's the word, agglomerating platforms, aggregating.
02:22:21 Yes, aggregating platforms.
02:22:24 I'm going to say that maybe that trend will continue.
02:22:27 But I don't know, maybe optimistically,
02:22:32 a sort of like maybe like a more like underground
02:22:37 sort of trend will emerge and become stronger.
02:22:41 Maybe there will be like a strong like a stronger like counterculture
02:22:44 sort of like not like something that will maybe some
02:22:49 maybe some kind of opposition to that will coagulate because there really is,
02:22:53 I don't know, I think it's a vague prediction, but it's something.
02:22:57 Yeah, I think for that to happen, crypto would need to completely die
02:23:02 because at the moment, the whole counterculture like desire
02:23:07 is in the minds of those crypto bros who are like fighting the system
02:23:11 and everyone else is just sort of laughing at them because they're stupid.
02:23:14 And everything they're doing is idiotic.
02:23:16 I don't know if there's like a counterculture to the internet as exists.
02:23:20 Everybody seems to hate Twitter and nobody seems to be trying to go anywhere else.
02:23:26 So like, I don't know, I see it staying about the same.
02:23:31 I mean, it's like Torrance.
02:23:32 Stuff like Torrance seem good.
02:23:35 Stuff that is like, you know, free freeware and just just distributed,
02:23:41 really distributed.
02:23:43 Yeah, I guess if there's like a what would you like the internet to be more?
02:23:50 I'd like it to be more independent individual websites
02:23:57 and that somehow people like going to in the same way that there's like the big city
02:24:02 where you have social media and then you can go on a country road
02:24:06 and explore the towns and the villages outside.
02:24:09 And there are cool websites everywhere.
02:24:11 And there's like a wonderful hamlet of Gibb and take dot site.
02:24:14 We need we need to bring back web rings.
02:24:17 I don't know what that is.
02:24:20 I think I think a web ring was basically just like back when there were
02:24:23 when everybody had a website, you would just like like like websites
02:24:27 would just like ally with each other and they would put links to each other
02:24:30 in their in their in their descriptions.
02:24:34 And then like just a bunch of websites that all linked to each other
02:24:37 would be called a web ring, right?
02:24:39 I think that's what they were.
02:24:41 Yeah, yeah, that's cool.
02:24:43 So maybe I don't know.
02:24:45 I could I could kind of see like a sort of retro movement coming back,
02:24:49 like a kind of like we sort of sort of recreate the old internet
02:24:54 with web, web rings and stuff sort of underneath the, you know,
02:24:58 the fucking the top level web 2.0.
02:25:00 Everything's accumulated on platforms.
02:25:03 Yeah, I think I'm.
02:25:06 I think server hosting costs.
02:25:12 Like you have to buy, you have to pay a server to host your website
02:25:18 or use your own computer.
02:25:20 And I think a technology that would be nice in the future
02:25:25 is like more peer to peer stuff.
02:25:29 So like making it more like what's that thing
02:25:34 that people use, those chat rooms that are like pre forums
02:25:40 that are basically proto forums that I know the ones to peer.
02:25:45 I know the one you're talking about sex hotlines.
02:25:48 I don't know what's going on. Yes, we need sex hotlines.
02:25:52 More sex hotlines.
02:25:53 That's what the internet is going to be.
02:25:54 I think the metaverse is going to completely fail.
02:25:56 I don't know. Oh, of course.
02:25:58 It's it's like it's it's.
02:26:00 Zuckerberg like discovering Second Life and thinking he's invented it.
02:26:03 Like, yeah.
02:26:05 Are you talking about like CompuServe?
02:26:07 I don't really know what I'm talking about.
02:26:09 I think I've heard of like a peer to peer messaging system.
02:26:12 I know the one you're talking about.
02:26:14 Early internet stuff.
02:26:16 I see IRC IRC IRC IRC.
02:26:20 I think you're talking about IRC internet relay chat.
02:26:23 Yeah. So like more peer to peer stuff to like lower the costs of
02:26:28 manage like having a server that has a lot of traffic.
02:26:31 If it's like spread out across, I don't know how stuff like that could work.
02:26:36 But like, all I know is that if you want a website,
02:26:39 you'll need to pay for however many people come to see it.
02:26:43 And you want people to see it, so you'll need to make a lot of money.
02:26:46 And if you need to make a lot of money,
02:26:49 it's in your best interest to maybe put advertising on the website.
02:26:53 And then when it comes to that, it's like,
02:26:55 well, what about all of these free services that have wider reach
02:26:58 and require no monetary input on your part?
02:27:01 And it's like, dang, I guess I should just post on these sites.
02:27:04 These these conglomerate everyone's here sort of things.
02:27:08 So like technology would need to make it really cheap for people
02:27:11 to have their own websites before people would actually be able to do it.
02:27:14 I mean, I mean, I have a website and it cost me like ten dollars a month.
02:27:19 Sure, like if you have if you had a lot of people coming to that website,
02:27:24 it would cost more, maybe would it?
02:27:29 Well, I guess not for a comic website.
02:27:31 I'm not entirely sure.
02:27:32 I don't really know how it works.
02:27:34 Larger traffic makes it slower to maybe maybe like if it needed to handle
02:27:38 like a bigger traffic load, I would have to upgrade like a subscription
02:27:42 to like a higher traffic version or something. Yeah. Yeah.
02:27:44 I mean, it's probably I mean, when a Homestuck update came out
02:27:47 and everybody was clicking on it, the website would crash.
02:27:51 So clearly, there's something that can go wrong if too many people
02:27:54 are reading your stuff.
02:27:55 So it's fine if like you're you're relatively obscure,
02:27:59 but as soon as it scales up, you need to scale up the money as well.
02:28:04 And so at that point, it becomes more of an of an annoyance.
02:28:11 The future sucks.
02:28:13 The future hasn't happened yet. We don't know.
02:28:16 It's true. Sad but true.
02:28:17 All right. Next next one.
02:28:19 Next one is called VTuber Revolution.
02:28:21 I don't know. Yeah.
02:28:23 Three, three, two, one, go.
02:28:26 Hey, PCP, I think I'm going to stop watching
02:28:29 unless you literally all become VTubers.
02:28:32 I want to see avatars moving around, bopping and bopping.
02:28:36 I want to see Ben St.
02:28:38 is the cop killer. I want to see Gibb moving around.
02:28:42 I want to see everyone's mouths flapping.
02:28:44 We have the mouth flaps animations on the podcast.
02:28:48 I think I'm just about done with this show.
02:28:51 Good. Thank you both for that.
02:28:54 They make a compelling point.
02:28:56 I tried to make that phantom horn VTuber rig one time and it was weird.
02:29:00 It didn't act right.
02:29:01 Its eyes were like jittery and I couldn't get them to stay still.
02:29:05 Yeah. Ben, your eyes are just jittery.
02:29:08 Some sort of a crazy setup to get at the tracking.
02:29:12 I think I've seen these clips of this one VTuber girl,
02:29:15 DM, who has like a three dimensional VTuber avatar.
02:29:20 Yeah. And her tracking is like, I think she uses like an iPhone.
02:29:25 And the face tracking on that is like perfect.
02:29:29 The expressions are like immediately picked up.
02:29:32 And it's like girl DM.
02:29:34 Oh, yeah. I just want to see what she looks like.
02:29:36 She's one of those people who has a really nice model.
02:29:40 Yeah, she's got a real nice model.
02:29:41 She's funny, which is nice.
02:29:43 I haven't bothered to like look at her streams.
02:29:45 But the clips I've seen are like, dang, that's really good tracking.
02:29:48 That really good face tracking shit.
02:29:51 It helps out the it was the models by the art gun.
02:29:53 They do a lot of really, really, really high quality ones.
02:29:56 Oh, a lot of the a lot of the face stuff can be done
02:30:00 so that it is mode shifting as opposed to trying to emulate every single expression.
02:30:04 So it will only like subtly change.
02:30:06 And then you press a button and it will switch to like different expressions.
02:30:08 But when you're playing a game,
02:30:10 pressing buttons to change your expression is too hard.
02:30:13 That's why you get a little off this controller and bind it to different things on that.
02:30:16 You have a little foot. I've seen people do that.
02:30:19 Yeah, this is I'm not an organ player.
02:30:23 Good guitar.
02:30:25 Sorry, clone hero players have foot pedals to activate certain things in game.
02:30:29 They're crazy.
02:30:30 I'm not a car driver.
02:30:35 What if I was playing a car game and I had a pedal
02:30:38 and I had my twitch like reaction pedal and I would switch over to it.
02:30:42 And like, oh, shit, I'm going to crash.
02:30:44 Click and I'm screaming.
02:30:46 It goes.
02:30:49 VTubers cringe.
02:30:50 Then I need to be like, I need to be a VTuber
02:30:54 and like have a nice freedy model and it's German.
02:30:56 I'm just like a cartoon German.
02:30:59 No, just a real German.
02:31:00 It's like German's face cut up and like, wait, yeah, just a realistic German.
02:31:03 I think I think I complained.
02:31:05 I think I complained about whenever I see VTubers that are all just like
02:31:10 VTubers on low level VTubers on Twitter,
02:31:13 all like evincing this weird like fake solidarity, this like fake friendly thing.
02:31:17 It's like, we all got to follow each other to support each other.
02:31:20 We're all going to make it.
02:31:21 No, it's a pyramid scheme.
02:31:23 It's a pyramid scheme.
02:31:24 That's not true, but it's annoying.
02:31:27 Red Man was a pretty good VR VTuber, not VR.
02:31:31 The best.
02:31:32 He was wobbly and he had one frame for his mouth opening.
02:31:35 The only problem was the eyes were would would not track at all
02:31:39 and it would completely lose track of my face.
02:31:41 Yeah, it was Phantom's eyes were the problem.
02:31:43 Just the pupils just would not stay still and it just didn't look right.
02:31:46 It didn't like it might have been where like big googly eyes.
02:31:50 It was probably just that my setup was not good enough.
02:31:53 The lighting was not good and it couldn't track it well.
02:31:57 OK, next next voicemail is called D and balls.
02:32:02 There it is three, two, one, go.
02:32:06 Ha, hey, what do you think about drum and bass music?
02:32:10 I don't fucking care.
02:32:12 I think it's pretty good.
02:32:13 I haven't heard much.
02:32:14 I think I listened to like a something on YouTube
02:32:17 that had a pig on the front cover.
02:32:19 Nice. Nice.
02:32:21 When I was in school, people listened to music
02:32:24 that they called drum and bass.
02:32:25 But I don't know if it counts as drum and bass anymore.
02:32:27 It sucked. So I don't know what drum and bass is.
02:32:31 I don't even know what drum and bass is.
02:32:33 The fucking Powerpuff Girls theme song,
02:32:36 that bit where the the drums are playing, that's drum and bass.
02:32:41 It sounds sounds fine.
02:32:43 See, when I was in secondary school,
02:32:44 people basically referred to drum and bass as like,
02:32:47 it's like soft the dubstep it was.
02:32:49 And it's like, this doesn't this is shit.
02:32:51 And also, I don't think that's what that should have been called.
02:32:54 That that that drum sample is like from like the 70s or 80s or some shit.
02:33:00 Yes, yes.
02:33:01 It's it's just being like reused and repurposed like a million times.
02:33:05 It has a name. I forgot what it's called.
02:33:07 It was from like some jazz called the stolen drum beat.
02:33:09 And the drummer is sad.
02:33:10 They didn't get royalties.
02:33:12 Yeah.
02:33:14 Anyway, this is voicemail.
02:33:16 Next voicemail is called one of us doesn't understand boxes.
02:33:20 Three, two, one, go.
02:33:23 Ben, just put it all in a fucking box.
02:33:28 No, like you take a box, you put the blu-ray in it,
02:33:32 then you put the book in it, then you close the box and seal it.
02:33:36 And you mail that customer.
02:33:37 It would be why the fuck do you need it?
02:33:39 Like, it would be more expensive, stupid, more expensive to ship.
02:33:44 Yes, it is so much more expensive.
02:33:46 He doesn't understand like, I don't know.
02:33:48 I don't deal with with a whole lot of ship.
02:33:50 Well, like clearly, you don't know, see, seems pretty simple.
02:33:54 Hmm. Ben, why don't you do this thing?
02:33:56 Hmm, could it be could it be for this reason?
02:34:00 I don't know. I don't know anything.
02:34:02 So why don't you do it?
02:34:03 Well, clearly, Ben doesn't understand boxes.
02:34:05 This guy doesn't understand shipping.
02:34:08 Dude, fucking. All right, all right.
02:34:09 I was selling all like me and my partner when we were moving to America.
02:34:13 We had to we had to sell a bunch of shit
02:34:15 because we couldn't take it all on the plane.
02:34:16 And we had a whole bunch of my little pony merch
02:34:19 that they had accrued over the years.
02:34:20 And we were like sort of falling out with the show.
02:34:22 So we're like, we'll just sell a bunch of his shit.
02:34:24 It was like eight hundred dollars worth of like various things.
02:34:27 And we advertised it on a Facebook group
02:34:30 and some person said they wanted it and we put it all in a box
02:34:34 and they were willing to pay like four hundred for it.
02:34:37 And the shipping was like three hundred seventy
02:34:40 because it was in a fucking box.
02:34:44 That's cold. Fucked.
02:34:46 Yes, really made like 30 bucks to this guy.
02:34:49 Yes, it is just it is simply much cheaper
02:34:52 to put the book in an envelope and send it as a letter
02:34:56 than it is to put it in a box and ship it as a package.
02:34:59 I got a CD on discogs from New Zealand recently.
02:35:03 And they said, hey, if I put it in a jewel case,
02:35:06 it'll literally cost like 10 bucks, like 15 bucks extra to ship.
02:35:10 If I put it, if I put the CD in an envelope, it'll be like two bucks.
02:35:14 And it's that all right.
02:35:15 And I'm like, sure.
02:35:16 And I got the CD in a very nice.
02:35:19 I have I have a big box.
02:35:20 So I think I have like 40.
02:35:22 I think I have like 40 more that I need to take to the post office,
02:35:26 which I will do as soon as the snow melts a little bit.
02:35:29 I think I'll give that.
02:35:30 Just bring a friend.
02:35:31 Maybe I'm like, yeah, if I if I could get one.
02:35:36 Next, the voicemail is called Terry Walker.
02:35:41 I'm putting it in chat right now.
02:35:43 There it is. Terry Walker, three, two, one, go.
02:35:47 All right. The setting is December 2019.
02:35:49 I'm making New Year's resolution to stop watching YouTube.
02:35:52 Believe me, I had a problem.
02:35:54 I'm not going to pretend I need to be caught up, though.
02:35:56 I do have a Twitter.
02:35:57 Then it was December, 2021.
02:35:59 I rewatch and get caught up on all the PCP's content.
02:36:02 Like I said, I have a problem.
02:36:05 There was a hot week there that I was confused about
02:36:08 because y'all were talking about the Brony lecture, but no matter how many times
02:36:11 I scrolled through the lecture playlist, I couldn't find it.
02:36:13 Yeah.
02:36:17 Well, where are you now?
02:36:19 See what you've done, Trixie?
02:36:20 What is it? Because this could have all been prevented.
02:36:22 This person.
02:36:24 I'm not sure what the point of this.
02:36:26 I'm not sure what the point of this is.
02:36:27 Isn't it interesting that if you haven't gotten to the point?
02:36:31 Oh, does he not?
02:36:32 Does he not know? Does he not know? Oh, yeah.
02:36:34 Well, there's no Brony lecture.
02:36:35 It was thrown in the trash. Trixie.
02:36:37 Trixie destroyed it.
02:36:38 Trixie destroyed it in a fit of fury of rage and from.
02:36:44 Yeah. Oh, yeah, you asked me for the lecture.
02:36:48 Will you? Well, I'll punish you for it.
02:36:50 You fools.
02:36:51 It was only, but this is only a character I'm playing.
02:36:57 Next.
02:36:58 Next voicemail is, yeah, it was destroyed, was destroyed, is the answer.
02:37:03 Next one is called, wait.
02:37:06 Well, okay.
02:37:07 Next one is called insanely transphobic procrastinators.
02:37:10 Part one, three, two, one, go.
02:37:15 So the reason I called in was I wanted to express
02:37:17 my confusion of Trixie critics that feel the need to shoot the arguments
02:37:20 in the foot by including the transphobia.
02:37:22 Like Trixie was clearly going through an asshole arc
02:37:25 long before transitioning ever came up or completely independent of being trans.
02:37:28 Who's saying that?
02:37:30 The first time I think people noticed anything was when Trixie got a girlfriend.
02:37:36 I wasn't one of the people that thought May was the problem.
02:37:39 She didn't reveal her politics at that point.
02:37:43 But the being high 24 seven and acting like they were the first person
02:37:47 that had discovered drugs, if she's not still in that arc,
02:37:50 that is the most cringe arc they've ever been on.
02:37:53 And then Trixie trying to shame the PCP for not paying May's way to Radcon.
02:37:57 Weirdly yelling at Manji for going to college and belittling everyone
02:38:01 that did go to college on a recorded episode for some reason.
02:38:04 That was fucking weird.
02:38:06 Convincing people to move to Boston or Virginia Beach for PCPHQ.
02:38:10 Like didn't Nate and Michelle actually move for the cantant reasons?
02:38:14 And then hating Boston because it was like cold or having to take a bus.
02:38:19 What the fuck?
02:38:20 Like people moved across country and then dropping projects
02:38:23 that other people were dependent on like cantant or I am games.
02:38:27 By 2020 comes around.
02:38:28 Everyone should have been rolling their eyes at Trixie coming in
02:38:31 with a new paradigm shift or abandoning projects long before the Brony lecture.
02:38:37 Like the how the marketed thing or those rants.
02:38:42 Well, yeah, I mean the signs for all that's all true.
02:38:45 I think I think for my part, it was like I didn't care too much
02:38:50 because I wasn't really involved and I had no stake in Trixie's career.
02:38:55 Yeah, I had no stake in it.
02:38:57 It wasn't like personally affecting me.
02:39:01 There's another part, by the way, there's one.
02:39:03 There's another part, too.
02:39:04 So let's just listen to that three, two, three, two, one go.
02:39:08 So yeah, feels like a full Kiwi Farms article without gender needing to come up.
02:39:13 Even with that, I'm one of the fans that found the PCP through the Digi Bro channel.
02:39:19 Do you all think this was an arc of selfishness and instability?
02:39:22 Or was she always an asshole? Always an asshole. Always an asshole.
02:39:27 It was always an asshole.
02:39:28 It just took she had she had to she had to get on top.
02:39:31 She had to have like everything handed to her.
02:39:33 And then once she had it, I would say as much I can be as much of an asshole
02:39:37 as I want, nothing bad will happen.
02:39:38 Well, I would say always an asshole through selfishness and self importance.
02:39:43 Yeah, she just doesn't.
02:39:45 She just doesn't care.
02:39:46 She just doesn't care about other people is the is the is the problem.
02:39:51 In my opinion, that's my diagnosis lack of empathy.
02:39:55 You're going to work for you once you get there.
02:39:57 Stupid golden witch, bitch, whatever it's called.
02:40:01 OK, where's Kusa, mega, you fuck?
02:40:05 Next next voicemail.
02:40:06 OK, OK, we're getting a bit into it.
02:40:09 I don't know if there's that many of these, but there's the next one is called
02:40:11 Yig commenters. No, no.
02:40:13 So three, two, one, go.
02:40:17 I've been I see you floored about
02:40:20 the Yig commenters being all positive on Trixie's video.
02:40:26 You know, she's just deleting all the rest.
02:40:29 That's all that's all that's going on.
02:40:31 That is true. That is true.
02:40:33 It's true.
02:40:34 But like, it's still insane that people aren't even saying those things.
02:40:39 Yeah, nevertheless, there's like hundreds of a few hundred people being like,
02:40:42 thank you so much for enlightening me, illuminating for me the truth.
02:40:48 Yes, I understand. It all makes sense now.
02:40:51 I'll do anything for you, my queen.
02:40:54 Bless.
02:40:56 Anyway, anyway, it is hope.
02:40:59 Yeah, some people are just beyond help.
02:41:02 Next voicemail is called Otaku Twilight.
02:41:07 Three, two, one, go.
02:41:10 Macross, do you remember? Love is an important classic.
02:41:12 I hope you actually watch the film.
02:41:14 Remembering love is based regardless of dumb internet beef.
02:41:18 I've never I've never seen Macross.
02:41:21 Cool. I had forgotten.
02:41:22 Is that what Jesus said?
02:41:24 That's some.
02:41:25 Yeah, because I guess because Trixie got that phrase remembering love from
02:41:29 what's what's his name, a ghost lightning who, I guess, got it from Macross.
02:41:35 But I've never seen Macross.
02:41:36 Is that the voice of Jesus on that voicemail?
02:41:39 It was a voice of Jesus.
02:41:41 It's quite like that.
02:41:43 Millions of sparkle.
02:41:43 Probably sparkle was Jesus, you know.
02:41:47 I said Jesus because Macross, like he's like, oh, Macross.
02:41:53 OK.
02:41:54 Oh, fuck.
02:41:55 I'm sorry.
02:41:57 Oh, Twilight is in the pony character.
02:42:02 Oh, you don't even know.
02:42:03 Yeah, it's Twilight Sparkle Sparkle.
02:42:06 There was like two.
02:42:07 You think I was that then.
02:42:10 Twilight must have been thinking Twilight like Edward.
02:42:12 Yeah, that's why I said Ed McMillan, but that's the.
02:42:15 Oh, you mean, you know, Jesus, like Edward Macmillan,
02:42:20 like, like, like Gish and and Meat Boy.
02:42:23 Yeah.
02:42:24 From Five Nights at Freddy's.
02:42:26 I don't know.
02:42:27 Next voicemail.
02:42:28 Yeah, next voicemail is called Question three, two, one, go.
02:42:33 All right, this one's for the Doritos English muffin guy.
02:42:36 That shit sucked.
02:42:37 You must have lost your mind.
02:42:39 Oh, fuck you.
02:42:41 Do you make your bed?
02:42:43 Piece of shit.
02:42:44 He's Doritos and English muffins are fucking tasty.
02:42:48 This guy's no taste.
02:42:49 From in the trash, you're talking about you're talking about
02:42:50 your your cluster punk kitchen recipe.
02:42:52 Yeah, good thing I'm here this week to defend myself, eat a, eat a dick.
02:42:56 I haven't tried it and I'm on a very strict diet as of like a week
02:43:00 and as of like two weeks ago, so I'm not going to try it anytime soon.
02:43:04 But I would try it and I'm not going to knock it until I it sounds weird.
02:43:07 It doesn't sound like it's any good at all.
02:43:10 Sound stupid as fuck.
02:43:11 You fucking imbecile.
02:43:13 However, however, I won't knock it until I try it.
02:43:16 So like maybe it only works if I make it because every time I've
02:43:19 given it to someone, I prepared it.
02:43:21 I put it together and I handed it to them.
02:43:22 Well, what did you do to it?
02:43:24 Do you wash his hands?
02:43:25 It's cold as grease.
02:43:26 You think you English toast English muffin butter it and then
02:43:29 what you sprinkle crushed up Doritos on toast, right?
02:43:31 Well, like you put like like three or four or five or six
02:43:34 however many Doritos you think is appropriate.
02:43:35 And you just kind of, you know, pushed the two halves of the muffin together
02:43:39 and you crunch it a little, crunch it down a little bit like, you know,
02:43:41 you know, like you eat it like a sandwich.
02:43:43 You eat it like a sandwich.
02:43:44 Yeah. And I've done that.
02:43:46 And I loved it and I've made it for like six or seven other people.
02:43:50 And everyone who I've given one to when they they were like a bit skeptical
02:43:54 and then they took a bite and they were like, oh, that's actually really good.
02:43:58 Damn, like all of them had that reaction.
02:44:00 So I've had a pretty good success.
02:44:02 Obviously, obviously someone's going to not like it because taste is like
02:44:06 it's fucking subjective, like like what I want to say, like food tastes.
02:44:10 Obviously, some people are going to hate it.
02:44:12 But I don't know.
02:44:14 I think it's good.
02:44:17 I would try. I would try.
02:44:19 I myself prefer what sits on a bagel.
02:44:24 What's a what's it?
02:44:25 What's a what's it?
02:44:25 It's a good. What is it?
02:44:26 It's a good, a good crisp.
02:44:28 It's a cheesy puff.
02:44:29 Crisp.
02:44:31 It's like a cheese puff.
02:44:32 You would just call it a cheese puff.
02:44:34 Yeah. Yeah.
02:44:36 Like, like a cheeto.
02:44:38 Oh, like, like, like, like Jax, maybe.
02:44:43 I don't know.
02:44:44 Oh, yeah, yeah.
02:44:46 Oh, those things that are like.
02:44:48 Yeah, those, those, those, those chips that are like, yeah.
02:44:52 Cheetos, Cheetos puffed and or Jax or cheese balls or whatever.
02:44:55 Yeah. Yeah.
02:44:56 Like we had we have a different name for them in New Zealand as well.
02:45:01 I mean, those on a bagel.
02:45:02 Yeah, I can see that being good.
02:45:04 Jax coming up. Jax coming up barrel.
02:45:06 I used to put a barrel.
02:45:08 Well, I used to put what sits on my sandwiches at school
02:45:10 because they they have a lot of flavor to them.
02:45:13 So they work really well as a sandwich.
02:45:14 Crisp.
02:45:15 Yeah, I guess.
02:45:18 I guess I could see it.
02:45:23 And they can't.
02:45:23 Should they melt in your mouth without the wishes?
02:45:27 And I say.
02:45:30 And I said, yeah, yeah.
02:45:33 Yeah. Next one is called.
02:45:36 Next one is called.
02:45:37 It's Janess three, two, one.
02:45:40 Ah, what's this?
02:45:42 Sorry. Sorry.
02:45:43 Ew, is this real?
02:45:45 I don't think so.
02:45:46 That's not real.
02:45:47 Look at that.
02:45:48 Hold on, hold on.
02:45:49 We can't continue.
02:45:50 I have to set.
02:45:51 You just remind me, Simsie, this is important.
02:45:53 I'd try it. Oh, no.
02:45:55 Where's my phone?
02:45:56 I saw something fucking horrendous, and this is real.
02:45:59 I took I took this fucking photo myself.
02:46:01 Oh, I'm pulling up my phone.
02:46:02 It was dark chocolate.
02:46:03 Yeah, maybe.
02:46:05 I'd try it.
02:46:06 You ever eat like cheese and onion crisps
02:46:08 and then had some chocolate right afterwards?
02:46:09 It's surprisingly good.
02:46:11 I've sometimes had like like some dark chocolate
02:46:15 and then like some salty snack.
02:46:18 Yeah, inside it and the same time or like just bread.
02:46:21 Bread, tiger bread and dark chocolate is like a great combo.
02:46:25 Tiger bread.
02:46:27 It's it's like bread with like burn melted cheese on the top.
02:46:30 Yeah.
02:46:32 That kind of cheese.
02:46:33 Is it? Oh, I thought it was just like a funny
02:46:38 something or other.
02:46:38 No, I'm pretty sure it's just like over cheese.
02:46:41 I've probably said this before,
02:46:42 but the pattern on this bread is much more reminiscent
02:46:44 of a giraffe than a tiger.
02:46:48 So the tiger.
02:46:50 All right, all right, look at this bullshit
02:46:52 if it'll actually copy the case.
02:46:54 Yeah.
02:46:56 Well, briefcase my fucking there,
02:46:59 fucking spicy Cheetos flaming hot ice cream.
02:47:03 Why?
02:47:05 They were just sweet.
02:47:07 It can't just taste like hot cheese.
02:47:12 Oh, I went to the fucking marble slab at the mall
02:47:17 and they had this poster and they replaced
02:47:20 Kai's banana flavor that he loves with this.
02:47:25 How dare they?
02:47:27 Did you try it?
02:47:28 No, I got chocolate with marshmallow and I want to I want to try it.
02:47:32 You know, and cream are both derived from milk.
02:47:37 OK, but it's like spicy.
02:47:39 It's like burning the space.
02:47:41 The idea. OK, here's what I think.
02:47:43 I think it's probably not like actually tastes like hot Cheetos.
02:47:48 I think it's probably some other flavor.
02:47:51 Like it looks like it's strawberry or something,
02:47:52 but maybe it has a little bit of spiciness in it.
02:47:54 Yeah, I think it's just spicy vanilla.
02:47:56 I bet you that's what it is.
02:47:58 He's he's staring at you.
02:48:00 I miss I can't I can't find rain, rain,
02:48:05 thermo, strawberry jalapeno anymore.
02:48:09 That was my favorite rain flavor.
02:48:10 I like the spicy strawberry.
02:48:12 You drink rain. What the hell?
02:48:14 Yeah, R.E.R.E.I.G.N.
02:48:18 It is a it is a bang like it is a bang like produced by the monster company.
02:48:23 I thought Boston was so polluted that you could taste different flavors
02:48:27 of rain depending on how heavy it was raining.
02:48:29 And you were outside and opening your mouth.
02:48:31 Well, since it snowed yesterday,
02:48:33 Munchie was saying that he was going to make snow cones out of the snow.
02:48:36 But then someone was saying like, no, no.
02:48:39 If it if it if it snows in the city,
02:48:42 it absorbs all the pollution from the air, like from the atmosphere,
02:48:45 like it have all the pollution in it.
02:48:47 Don't eat the snow.
02:48:48 Even carbon monoxide in your belly.
02:48:50 Even the clean surface snow is toxic.
02:48:53 Well, I mean, I would recommend about toxic,
02:48:56 but it would definitely be a bit grimy.
02:48:58 It would be a bit unclean as I was just sitting outside.
02:49:01 I don't know. I'm entrusted.
02:49:02 That's everything. No, that's so dumb.
02:49:04 OK, I don't know about all this absorb from the from the air.
02:49:07 That does happen with rain.
02:49:10 OK, like if you but it's not.
02:49:12 But but if it's like, OK, if the air was clean,
02:49:15 then if it was just like snow, like on the ground,
02:49:18 like if it was like a foot deep, you could grab some off the top of the surface
02:49:21 and it wouldn't have it wouldn't be grimy.
02:49:23 There wouldn't be any dirt on it.
02:49:25 It would just be it would be clean from the top of the snow pile.
02:49:27 It wouldn't be dirt.
02:49:29 But the as it falls through the air, it picks up tiny particulates.
02:49:34 OK, I'm sorry.
02:49:36 If you grab if you grab fruit off off a tree, you wash it.
02:49:39 But if you wash snow, it'll melt.
02:49:41 So what can you do?
02:49:42 You can't clean it, spin outdoors, a bug sat on it.
02:49:45 Probably if it's if it's really cold outside,
02:49:48 you left some ice cream out there all all night and it didn't melt
02:49:50 because it's really cold. Would you eat it?
02:49:53 No, same thing.
02:49:54 What? Why not?
02:49:59 Well, you mean like ice cream?
02:50:00 You're not what bugs get on it, Ben.
02:50:02 What bugs have gotten on my snow?
02:50:04 Oh, like wait, like just out.
02:50:07 Yeah, I can't believe what I'm hearing.
02:50:10 You guys are like weirded out by the thought of like eating snow off the ground.
02:50:13 No, no, I'm not.
02:50:15 I eat snow, but I just think it's funny that I eat snow, but I wouldn't eat another thing.
02:50:20 OK, well, I think about like like pollution in the air
02:50:23 getting into the snow as it falls is a true thing.
02:50:26 I don't know how bad it would be.
02:50:28 Ice cream is full of sugar, so I'm sure it would attract pests.
02:50:31 Yeah, I probably would if it just left a bear ice cream cone outside.
02:50:34 No, I would need it.
02:50:35 But like if I left it out in like a pint in like a closed pint, sure.
02:50:40 Yeah. OK, OK, whatever. OK, whatever.
02:50:43 I don't know. I'd never heard this thing.
02:50:45 I'd never heard this thing about absorbing toxins from the air before, but but maybe.
02:50:49 OK, I think it would kill you.
02:50:51 But I'm sure. No, whatever.
02:50:53 All right. Next voicemail is an image of Emmanuel Macron.
02:50:59 I don't know. We missed one because I posted the What's It's Oreo image.
02:51:03 Oh, you're right. You're right.
02:51:04 Janice, right. Janice. OK, three, two, one, go.
02:51:09 If you haven't heard the news yet,
02:51:11 Scott Pilgrim is getting an anime editor.
02:51:14 You asked this last week and the author is going to be the executive producer
02:51:18 on the project. Nice.
02:51:19 This made me wonder, since your comic's art style was mainly influenced by Scott.
02:51:25 The exact same question last week.
02:51:26 How would you feel if your comics were adapted into anime?
02:51:31 And how would you feel about Japanese dubbing of your own creative character?
02:51:36 No, I answered this last week.
02:51:37 Next voicemail is a next voicemail is a an image of Emmanuel Macron.
02:51:43 Oh, my God. I don't know.
02:51:45 Oh, my God.
02:51:46 Posted in the first two of them and then not reaching for.
02:51:51 Oh, this is OK.
02:51:52 This is just a bunch of stuff.
02:51:54 Emmanuel Macron said I saw I saw a good one of these
02:51:58 political compasses about I think it was JFK.
02:52:02 No, it wasn't JFK. It was FDR.
02:52:06 No, was it FDR? Was it Eisenhower? I don't know.
02:52:10 Whatever. Thanks for the fucking meme.
02:52:12 I don't care. No, not reading it.
02:52:15 Next voicemail is a Tumblr link.
02:52:19 Here it is.
02:52:21 Tumblr.
02:52:22 I don't know those words in here.
02:52:24 So there's nothing here.
02:52:25 There's nothing here. It's a broken link.
02:52:27 All right, cool.
02:52:28 We're moving right along.
02:52:29 Use a link shortener.
02:52:31 Use a URL shortener next time voicemail.
02:52:33 Yeah, next voicemail is another image.
02:52:36 It's called Improved the podcast logo.
02:52:39 This is from the freaking epic artist at the artist.
02:52:42 Freaking the freaking.
02:52:48 Fixed your logo and finally made it make good good and make sense.
02:52:52 Please use it from now on.
02:52:53 Oh, OK.
02:52:55 Why the fuck not?
02:52:56 I guess. Yeah, Ben said more like Ben Tate.
02:52:59 Given Tate more like Given Snake.
02:53:01 Tom Oliver more like who?
02:53:02 Hey, that's my joke.
02:53:04 They stole it. Why?
02:53:06 Why did you say about me?
02:53:08 There's the text at the bottom.
02:53:09 Given Snake.
02:53:10 They called you Given Snake.
02:53:12 Given Snake. That's fair.
02:53:15 Because I got a really long neck.
02:53:17 Yeah, like Charlotte.
02:53:18 And I am entirely neck.
02:53:20 This is objectively better than our current logo.
02:53:22 That's true.
02:53:24 I remember Ben's Tate.
02:53:26 You could put you could set that as the YouTube thing
02:53:28 and nobody would notice how screwed up it is.
02:53:30 Honestly, maybe I just fucking will.
02:53:33 Maybe if I'm in the mood later, I will do exactly that.
02:53:36 Well, it's about on April Fool's, but then never change it back.
02:53:41 A February Fool's next next voicemail is called.
02:53:47 What's it called?
02:53:48 It's called Improving Your Intros 5000
02:53:50 percent with this one weird trick.
02:53:53 Three, two, one, go.
02:53:55 All right, PCP, here's the deal.
02:53:57 No intro, right?
02:53:57 I'm a Zoomer.
02:53:59 I grew up watching YouTubers.
02:54:01 And while I do enjoy the PCP, you know,
02:54:03 there's one thing that just really piss me off about podcasts.
02:54:07 And it's the fact that you're not YouTuber enough.
02:54:10 Every time I watch, you know, a new podcast, a new video,
02:54:13 I don't know what to do.
02:54:14 You don't give me fricking instructions.
02:54:17 And any viewer like me will not know what to do.
02:54:20 So from now on, I want you to have a similar intro to this,
02:54:24 what I'm about to do right now.
02:54:27 What's up, PCP Nation coming back right at you again
02:54:31 with a new video, a new podcast.
02:54:34 And guys, this one is going to be crazy.
02:54:38 But before you watch, remember to like, subscribe,
02:54:42 bring that bell, put on all notifications
02:54:45 so you don't miss a single upload.
02:54:47 And remember to watch the entire video
02:54:50 preferably multiple times.
02:54:52 So we get that sweet watch.
02:54:54 I want. All right, guys, we'll see you next time.
02:54:57 Just watch this video from now.
02:54:59 Very cool. Yeah.
02:55:00 I want people to know that sort of intro.
02:55:02 So the viewers will know what's what's up, what to do.
02:55:06 I want people to miss our uploads and people like.
02:55:10 Can we get Eliza to put that at the beginning of the episode?
02:55:13 Just like just some guy saying, what's up, guys?
02:55:15 Welcome to a new video.
02:55:16 Some guy.
02:55:18 Sure. Why not?
02:55:20 Yeah, yeah, yeah, in fact, put it at the beginning of every episode
02:55:23 from now on, so we don't have to do it.
02:55:25 I don't like.
02:55:27 I don't like the YouTube thing that has become normal.
02:55:31 It was it was like hilariously bad.
02:55:35 We the entire time and it still is.
02:55:37 But people are just used to it now.
02:55:39 Dude, I fucking hate like terminal YouTube of voice.
02:55:42 I see it when I when I if I find like an obscure Minecraft video,
02:55:44 I guarantee they'll be like, oh, what's up, guys?
02:55:47 We'll go back to another Minecraft video and they just just fucking it's awful.
02:55:52 I can't understand what they're saying.
02:55:54 It's a roller coaster of of like like literally like.
02:56:00 Welcome to the one of German craft.
02:56:04 The the I don't want you to I don't want you to subscribe.
02:56:08 Here's what I want you to go to the Patreon pledge to the Patreon.
02:56:11 And then I want you to go unsubscribe and unring that bell.
02:56:14 So just forget that we exist and forget that you're pledged.
02:56:17 It's what happened to David Lynch to give and take instead.
02:56:21 Patreon.com slash give and take.
02:56:23 Uh, it's what is this?
02:56:26 It's it's David Lynch at like a weekly podcast thing where he had a funny fucking
02:56:31 YouTuber intro and he just started like every time he said it,
02:56:34 he just like made the vow.
02:56:36 He drew out the vowel sounds even longer and someone compiled it.
02:56:40 And it's just like the second half of the video is just him going.
02:56:44 Ooh, like just like over various videos like half a year.
02:56:49 I'm reeling a little bit from the fact that like David Lynch uploads YouTube like vlogs.
02:56:55 What the hell?
02:56:57 In circle David Lynch saying what January one.
02:57:02 Ali's are the intro of the podcast should just be him going.
02:57:06 That's the intro.
02:57:10 Very nice.
02:57:12 What is it?
02:57:13 What word is he saying?
02:57:15 Is he saying you to?
02:57:19 I like to believe that he just sat there for an entire year straight doing this.
02:57:25 OK, I can't I can't listen to any more of this.
02:57:27 I can't stand it.
02:57:28 Thank you David Lynch.
02:57:32 Next voicemail I posted it up above is called Banana.
02:57:36 Three, two, one, go.
02:57:39 Does your life have a principle or a set of principles?
02:57:42 No.
02:57:44 The principle crop from Captain Underpants.
02:57:46 Fuck, how are dying?
02:57:49 I like probably do, but I couldn't explain it because I don't know how to speak.
02:57:53 I would say I like to not have a boss.
02:57:55 I like to own my work.
02:57:58 I like to own.
02:57:59 I like to own my work, I think is one of my guiding principles.
02:58:03 I guess that's a pretty good one.
02:58:05 Be nice and smiley to everybody.
02:58:08 If I have a ridiculous idea, no one's going to make it unless I do it.
02:58:12 So I have to. That's a good one.
02:58:15 Yeah, that's where all the voicemails came from, by the way, I'm sorry.
02:58:20 Yeah, where? Where else?
02:58:23 No one else is going to do it.
02:58:24 I had to know nobody else was going to be snakes.
02:58:30 It's true, sad, but true.
02:58:32 All right, next next one is called.
02:58:34 Next one is called Stonks.
02:58:38 OK, three, two, one, go.
02:58:42 Then it's it's happening.
02:58:44 It's happening.
02:58:44 AOC is down. It's down a whole bunch and you can buy in.
02:58:47 You can buy in with all the AOC is down and you can buy in and then it's going to moon
02:58:51 and then we're going to be fucking rich. We're all going to be rich.
02:58:55 You know, like unless it's a week later, so maybe it's down even more
02:58:59 or maybe it's already mooned and it would be too late.
02:59:02 Who the fuck knows?
02:59:05 Bitcoin, how did how did how did Bitcoin do today?
02:59:08 Yeah, it's kind of just plateauing.
02:59:11 It went big, big.
02:59:12 It went big down.
02:59:14 It went big down when Trixie premiered that new video because of that new video
02:59:20 announcing that she hates did you broke Crater?
02:59:23 No, Crater, it cratered the value of Ethereum and Bitcoin.
02:59:26 The market will never recover.
02:59:27 It has it has bumped up a little bit since then.
02:59:30 It's recovered a bit.
02:59:30 It's kind of plateauing around 38 Le Mans.
02:59:34 Damn, man, Bitcoin's fucked.
02:59:37 The coins really fucked up.
02:59:39 I really don't like it.
02:59:41 Did you watch the did you watch that line go up video?
02:59:44 Oh, yeah, I've watched that.
02:59:45 But even before that, I found these this info on the energy consumption
02:59:52 of Bitcoin, like if you're in the second worst, Bitcoin is the worst by far.
02:59:57 Yeah, I think it's something like one point five million visa
03:00:00 transactions is the equivalent energy cost of a single Bitcoin transaction.
03:00:04 Bitcoin is like specifically designed to be inefficient.
03:00:07 Like it's it's supposed to it's supposed to be slow and unwieldy
03:00:11 in a way that is designed to mimic gold.
03:00:14 Yeah, but worse and all the energy comes from everyone doing repeat work.
03:00:20 Yeah, everyone trying to mine the same
03:00:22 like hundreds of people mining the same coin, but only one person actually gets it.
03:00:26 And then all the other 99 people or more who are mining that coin.
03:00:29 The energy goes in the trash.
03:00:30 It was worthless.
03:00:31 But man, this this this technology is so amazing.
03:00:34 Isn't it so isn't it so good?
03:00:36 It's it's it's great.
03:00:38 If it's great, if what you think technology is supposed to do is like
03:00:42 partition things away from the public so that someone can charge money for them.
03:00:48 Yeah, but if you think if you think if you think that's a technological
03:00:51 announcement, it's public, though, right?
03:00:52 Like it's all a public.
03:00:54 You can look you sure you can look at it.
03:00:55 Yeah, it's publicly.
03:00:56 But then it's decentralized by which I mean it's it's it's not
03:01:00 decentralized, actually.
03:01:02 It's dude, it's dude.
03:01:03 I love how decentralized NFTs are.
03:01:05 I mean, I can't wait to get my NFT show on Amazon.
03:01:08 It's it's decentralized.
03:01:10 It's decentralized right up until anyone has a dispute and then a fucking
03:01:14 coven of witches get together to decide the fate of everyone.
03:01:18 Did that stupid fucking NFT
03:01:20 cartoon ever actually come out?
03:01:21 Was it just a little 10 second clip I saw?
03:01:23 No, no, no.
03:01:24 It's like a six minute family is free NFT cartoons.
03:01:27 And Reddit family had an episode and it's like on Amazon Prime or on
03:01:31 some service or some garbage or where it's going.
03:01:34 I don't know. It's it's it's a six minutes long.
03:01:36 I didn't actually watch it.
03:01:37 I I didn't watch it.
03:01:39 I watched someone else watch it.
03:01:42 I watched I watched the dire gentleman recap it.
03:01:45 And they they didn't watch it real time.
03:01:48 So I had no idea how long it was.
03:01:50 I got the feeling that it was like 15 minutes, but maybe it's shorter than that.
03:01:55 Looks great.
03:01:56 Looks amazing.
03:01:58 I might go watch this episode.
03:01:59 Just see. I'm curious.
03:02:01 It's unless it gives the money in which case I won't.
03:02:04 It's pretty. It's pretty good.
03:02:07 It's pretty great, actually.
03:02:11 It's it's maybe slightly better than you might expect from a.
03:02:14 No, that's not even true.
03:02:16 That's not it.
03:02:17 It's going to say what?
03:02:18 Wait, what?
03:02:19 I was going to I was going to say, yeah, no, no,
03:02:21 because like just so much NFT art looks like shit.
03:02:24 And like, at least it is a card.
03:02:26 I guess it is a cartoon.
03:02:28 I mean, it's not.
03:02:29 It doesn't look good or anything.
03:02:30 But they look like I guess I guess they did make it.
03:02:34 It's it's pretty dog.
03:02:35 It's no smiling friends.
03:02:36 I'll tell you that.
03:02:38 I still I still haven't watched smiling.
03:02:40 Smiling friends is just a joy.
03:02:43 It's good. I should.
03:02:44 I should watch it.
03:02:45 It seems good.
03:02:47 All right. Next one, which was that?
03:02:50 Seventy one next voicemail is there it is.
03:02:56 And it is called.
03:02:57 Fuck, I can't print.
03:02:58 Annihilation Road to Radcon three, two, one, go.
03:03:04 Hello, Ben and Gibb. Hello, PCP.
03:03:08 I've just finished finally the copy of Road to Radcon
03:03:13 that I bought recently.
03:03:15 And from it, I come away with a lesson and a question.
03:03:20 The lesson being that Ben St.
03:03:22 is a significantly better writer than Trixie is.
03:03:27 The other thing, the question is,
03:03:31 since I'm a bit of a new fan and listener of the podcast,
03:03:35 who really only started listening to the episodes
03:03:38 after the great exodus, shall we call it, happened.
03:03:42 Yeah. What or whom is cold corona?
03:03:48 Is there any short form answer to this or any
03:03:51 piece of content that I can be pointed to to explain what the
03:03:55 fuck amazing because I am a bit confused.
03:04:00 Otherwise, a good wrap up on the story, Ben.
03:04:04 I've got to be honest.
03:04:05 I'm not really sure either.
03:04:06 What? Really?
03:04:08 I've never really gotten this because you haven't.
03:04:10 You haven't watched Jesse's videos.
03:04:12 So that's why. No, that's true.
03:04:13 I haven't watched the single.
03:04:14 Yeah, he's a corona is a real.
03:04:18 His videos.
03:04:18 If you don't know, if you don't know,
03:04:21 Road to Radcon, the ending of Road to Radcon,
03:04:24 basically, the entire conclusion is about is centered on cold corona.
03:04:29 It's like about him. OK.
03:04:31 Because I wrote the road to Radcon, but I haven't opened it at all.
03:04:35 OK.
03:04:37 The corona is like like Jesse's video game reviews
03:04:42 were like half like sincere video game stuff
03:04:45 and also parodies of like that guy with the glasses as content.
03:04:49 And Colt Corona was supposed to be like the stupid idiot character
03:04:55 that like reviewers often have.
03:04:59 And like things would happen like, well, I'm in this video.
03:05:05 What's going on, Jesse?
03:05:07 He had like that sort of a relationship.
03:05:11 And he's like grown beyond that.
03:05:13 He's he was like the front, like the the main character of like the horseshoe saga.
03:05:20 And he's like, yeah, he's he's in bodies.
03:05:24 All of the worst traits of the Brony Frandom.
03:05:27 It's it's he's a complex guy, but he's also like really stupid.
03:05:30 He's just got a horse head.
03:05:31 He has the innocence of a child.
03:05:33 He has like a child's mind, but he's like a violent like
03:05:37 rapist, I think.
03:05:40 Now, that's Michelangelo Michelangelo.
03:05:43 Yeah. Yeah, yeah, you're right.
03:05:45 Donatello. That's not a tello.
03:05:47 That's not a tello.
03:05:49 He sang that funny vapor wave song, I don't know.
03:05:53 Yeah, he's he's a Jesse.
03:05:54 He's he's Jesse wearing a horse mask, but he's a whole character unto himself.
03:05:58 OK. So yeah, that's hard to like explain
03:06:02 because I haven't really tried to explain him.
03:06:04 But yeah, I won't I won't I won't explain
03:06:07 what his role is in the ending of Road to Radcon
03:06:11 available at stcomics.com slash store dot html.
03:06:15 I won't explain his role because it would be a spoiler.
03:06:17 But it's just really funny.
03:06:19 It's just really funny to imagine like a new
03:06:22 a new PCP fan who is not familiar with all that stuff.
03:06:25 Just being like, what what is this?
03:06:28 What does this mean?
03:06:31 Good, good question, though.
03:06:33 Yeah, it is great. It makes makes me smile.
03:06:36 A life history lesson for me. Awesome.
03:06:39 I'm trying to think if I wonder if there's other
03:06:43 like stuff in the ending that like you wouldn't understand.
03:06:48 That's that's probably the big one.
03:06:51 It's still out of like.
03:06:55 Yeah, I don't know. That's probably the big one.
03:06:56 Yeah, I'm glad I'm glad you liked my ending.
03:06:59 I was not very confident in my prose writing ability.
03:07:03 So I'm glad you liked it.
03:07:06 Thanks. OK, next one is called.
03:07:09 It's just called OOH. OOH post.
03:07:13 OK, three, two, one, go.
03:07:16 OOH podcast, OOH me likey make longer.
03:07:25 Well, we got so many voicemails.
03:07:26 We're going to have a really long one this time.
03:07:27 It's an epic podcast.
03:07:30 You know, wait, I'm like going
03:07:32 heading to the store in like 20 minutes, by the way.
03:07:34 Really? OK, we might.
03:07:36 Well, we'll try to we'll try to be done.
03:07:37 But I want to say about the retro radical.
03:07:39 I did. I did try.
03:07:40 I actually tried to like sort of mimic
03:07:42 Trixie's like writing style a bit.
03:07:45 I don't know how successful I was,
03:07:46 but I tried to keep the like the tone consistent.
03:07:50 It was very respect, I'm sure.
03:07:52 It felt well like a good continuation.
03:07:55 I didn't feel like, all right, I'm taking over the show now.
03:07:58 And it's me, Ben saying, completely different.
03:08:01 Like you actually finished the story.
03:08:03 It was gone.
03:08:05 No, there were there was a tone.
03:08:07 There was a tone I tried to keep the tone consistent.
03:08:11 And I tried to keep like like like she would make
03:08:14 like the way that she would sort of like make a joke that was basically just a
03:08:17 sentence like she would just make like a long alliterative sentence or something
03:08:21 or just just attack like a bunch of weird adjective.
03:08:23 I tried to like sort of duplicate that and like and copy it a bit to
03:08:29 I thought it came up pretty good.
03:08:31 OK, next one is moving right along here.
03:08:36 Next one is a trans zone from Chip Wiseman.
03:08:40 Three, two, one, go.
03:08:42 Ni hao, Ben and Gib.
03:08:44 So actually, this is just a question for Gib.
03:08:46 So, Ben, if you want to go and draw your comic or something, feel free to do that.
03:08:50 So, Gib, I have a panel working on you.
03:08:53 We're talking about Davoo's new video and how her voice is like amazing.
03:08:58 And yeah, so as a trans femoid, who is, shall we say,
03:09:03 vocally challenged myself, I was wondering if you ever got back to her
03:09:07 and found out like what she does.
03:09:09 Does she have a personal vocal trainer?
03:09:11 What exercise does she do?
03:09:13 Stuff like that.
03:09:14 Second thing in the spirit of sharing the knowledge,
03:09:16 I'd like to put this out there for anybody who is on their own trans voice journey.
03:09:21 And that is, check out the YouTube channel called Trans Voice Lessons.
03:09:24 She does a bunch of videos, mostly going into like the theory of vocal feminization,
03:09:29 like, you know, physically what's happening with your different muscles
03:09:32 and voice folds and stuff.
03:09:34 It's really interesting stuff, great for understanding what's going on.
03:09:38 But she doesn't really go into the practical element of it much,
03:09:41 like actually what to do to practice.
03:09:44 So it's not a one stop shop.
03:09:46 Anyway, thank you and have a happy Chinese New Year.
03:09:49 Trans Voice Lessons.
03:09:51 Do they help trans males as well?
03:09:53 I wonder.
03:09:54 They they definitely would live.
03:09:57 It's about theory.
03:09:58 Yeah, I mean, well, I don't know about that YouTube channel.
03:10:02 But yeah, the people try to change their voice
03:10:06 in either direction.
03:10:08 Yeah, I never talked to Davoo about that.
03:10:10 I guess I should or could.
03:10:13 But I imagine the answer is just going to be like,
03:10:16 oh, yeah, I watched some YouTube videos about it.
03:10:18 And Chip, why not?
03:10:20 Chip, why not simply ask Davoo?
03:10:23 Why ask Gib?
03:10:24 Did you ask Davoo and what did Davoo say?
03:10:26 Why not simply ask Davoo?
03:10:29 I don't know.
03:10:30 She's hard to get in contact with.
03:10:31 It sounded like she had better voice than Davoo might have, anyway.
03:10:36 Yeah, probably. Yeah, whatever.
03:10:38 I just listened to a bit of this person's voice,
03:10:41 this trans voice lessons.
03:10:42 Yeah, they got a good voice.
03:10:45 All right, next.
03:10:45 The knowledge is all there.
03:10:46 It's just like, all right, time to commit to learning.
03:10:49 I'm like, oh, it's a whole skill.
03:10:51 I don't want to do that.
03:10:53 Absolutely. That's true.
03:10:55 Next one is X minus one.
03:10:57 Three. Did you miss one?
03:10:59 Did I miss one?
03:11:00 Yeah, there's a five second.
03:11:01 Oh, sorry, sorry.
03:11:02 Yeah, go go back to the five second one is X minus one.
03:11:05 OK, three, two, one, go.
03:11:08 Next.
03:11:10 Oh, God.
03:11:12 Oh, no, it's going to be the time it's three.
03:11:15 It's three hundred.

03:11:19 We're going to we're going to yell this is Sparta really loudly.
03:11:23 I hope it's not a disappointment
03:11:25 if we don't do anything super cool because I have nothing.
03:11:28 I have nothing in mind.
03:11:29 Sorry. Sorry.

03:11:48 Remember, my love is a fine movie and the series is a beloved classic
03:11:52 and doesn't deserve slander.
03:11:53 Check out Discotheque's Blurry.
03:11:55 They do good preservation of classics.
03:11:59 What is this makes me like in a submarine?
03:12:03 Otaku Twilight just makes me think about friendship is witchcraft
03:12:06 and how funny Otaku Twilight was in that and how I'll never make anything
03:12:11 as even half as good in my entire life as friendship is witchcraft.
03:12:15 It is good and it holds up and I need to rewatch it for the fifth time.
03:12:20 I should I should just give up.
03:12:21 I should just give up.
03:12:22 Yeah, sit in a hole. Yeah. Yeah.
03:12:25 Yeah, I know. No, no, no, you're not supposed to agree.
03:12:29 No, I love my little pony.
03:12:31 So do I love sitting in a hole.
03:12:36 Friendship is bitchcraft.
03:12:38 Friendship is cringe.
03:12:40 Friendship is cringe.
03:12:41 Next one is called episode 300 predictions.
03:12:45 Wait, I already uploaded this one twice.
03:12:47 OK, whatever. Three, two, one, go.
03:12:49 Episode 300 starts with the original procrastinator's podcast theme.
03:12:54 Trixie has an autistic meltdown with endless jets.
03:12:58 And then they talk about it on the podcast.
03:13:01 Monkey Jones makes a grand return.
03:13:04 Cyber shell and cheesy Manfredo become full time members.
03:13:08 Tom dies comes out as transgender.
03:13:12 Known as the best girl ever.
03:13:15 Ben finally calls me back.
03:13:21 What was that last one?
03:13:22 I feel like I've heard that before.
03:13:24 Which one?
03:13:26 The whole voicemail, I feel like I've heard it before.
03:13:29 Am I crazy?
03:13:30 Did you send it?
03:13:32 I didn't send it. That's not me.
03:13:35 If we go back to the old days, we can have we can have Nate and Trixie
03:13:41 having another boring conversation about like the YouTube algorithm.
03:13:45 That those those were the good old days.
03:13:47 Bring that back, return to tradition for episode 300.
03:13:52 All right, next one is called Kyle and Funny Man.
03:13:56 Episode four, it's dark now.
03:13:58 Critical acclaim, please.
03:14:00 Three, two, one, go.
03:14:02 The show is dark now, but that's what makes it good.
03:14:08 No more funny times for Kyle and Funny Man.
03:14:12 It's dark and depressing, but that's what makes it good.
03:14:16 It's Kyle and Funny Man in space.
03:14:26 That's right. We have crossed the threshold.
03:14:28 This is what the show is now.
03:14:30 It's dark filled with pathos, deep characters,
03:14:33 and that's what the show is now. No more fucking nonsense.
03:14:36 All right, let's go.
03:14:39 Hey, hey, Funny Man.
03:14:41 How about we go on a sweet, fricking adventure?
03:14:44 I know I know the last episode was a bit dark,
03:14:46 but maybe we can be more lighthearted this episode.
03:14:50 No, I cannot.
03:14:52 I'm going to go to a therapist and it's going to be one
03:14:56 entire episode where I just talked to this.
03:14:59 My wife couldn't remember and I had to wear a diaper
03:15:02 to make her happy one last time.
03:15:04 And that's going to be an episode.
03:15:06 Well, I guess I can go do an episode
03:15:10 where I realized that my life has no meaning
03:15:13 because I try to have fun on my own, but I can't.
03:15:15 And I'm like, what's the deal? What is life?
03:15:17 Oh, my God. Oh, yeah.
03:15:20 And to do that, we must argue now, so I hate you.
03:15:24 Well, I hate you too, Funny Man.
03:15:26 Let's go do that.
03:15:27 And that's right, people.
03:15:28 This show is now we're going to have a huge critical claim
03:15:30 to show so fucking good. Yes, yes.
03:15:33 Okay.
03:15:36 I love how like that was almost entirely the show is talking
03:15:40 about what the show is.
03:15:44 That's just podcasting.
03:15:45 That's just podcasting.
03:15:50 That wasn't as dark as I expected.
03:15:52 It wasn't as dark as I thought it was going to be.
03:15:53 Where's the murder? Where's the tragedy?
03:15:56 Funny Man didn't even tell a joke.
03:15:59 Get out.
03:16:00 Well, the show is dark now.
03:16:01 The show is dark.
03:16:03 Funny Man.
03:16:03 It's like, no.
03:16:04 My, yeah, it should have been like,
03:16:06 my name isn't Funny Man anymore.
03:16:07 I can't see the joy in the world.
03:16:10 My name is Ma.
03:16:11 I have, I have sadness.
03:16:13 Cancer. I have depression, cancer.
03:16:15 And boy, howdy is it taking a hold in my brain.
03:16:20 And I'm getting divorced as well from you, Kyle.
03:16:23 No.
03:16:26 And here's a dagger that I'm going to throw,
03:16:29 throw into your torso.
03:16:31 Here I go.
03:16:32 No, Funny Man.
03:16:33 And I lost my wallet on the bus home.
03:16:40 Next voicemail.
03:16:42 What's the next one?
03:16:43 The next one is called Ben St.
03:16:45 gets destroyed in the marketplace of ideas.
03:16:48 Three, two, one, go.
03:16:51 What's up?
03:16:52 It's me, Dusty Dumps.
03:16:54 And I'm basically just here to do a victory lap
03:16:57 all over Ben St's corpse.
03:16:59 Because yes, Ben St may have done a sweet ass
03:17:05 lecture about Tails gets trolled.
03:17:07 He may have been the first people,
03:17:08 one of the first people in the world
03:17:10 to interview Laserbot of Tails gets trolled.
03:17:14 That video is critically under viewed.
03:17:15 And also CC as well.
03:17:17 And you might have voiced some characters
03:17:21 in the official dub, but has he named a character
03:17:24 in the comic?
03:17:26 No.
03:17:27 But I have now the character that is a troll,
03:17:33 which is a corner that appears for two pages
03:17:36 in chapter 14 has been officially named by me
03:17:41 as now a rigor mortis.
03:17:44 And you can see it on the wiki.
03:17:47 Rigor Morphis is his official name now.
03:17:50 And it's credited to me.
03:17:51 So get fucked, Ben St.
03:17:56 How do you retroactively name a character?
03:18:01 We just claim it.
03:18:02 You put a flag in it.
03:18:04 The mint is mint him on the blockchain.
03:18:07 Yeah.
03:18:10 How does I wonder?
03:18:11 What if you made an NFT of the United States of America?
03:18:16 Wonder what would be the ramifications
03:18:18 of minting, say, the entire United States of America
03:18:21 on the blockchain?
03:18:23 Dude, I don't even try that.
03:18:24 You should try it then.
03:18:27 No, think of the impact on the environment.
03:18:30 No, no, I couldn't.
03:18:32 But it would make a lot of money.
03:18:33 No, that's just something anti-NFT bro says.
03:18:36 If America gets packaged up as an NFT,
03:18:39 then I can't like pollute anymore.
03:18:40 Think about it.
03:18:43 Yeah, yeah.
03:18:46 OK.
03:18:46 Next voicemail is, it's called something.
03:18:50 Come on, load.
03:18:51 Thanks.
03:18:52 It's called YouTube swearing arc four.
03:18:56 OK, actually final this time.
03:18:58 Three, two, one, go.
03:19:00 All right.
03:19:01 Dusty dumps back again with an update
03:19:04 on the exciting YouTube censorship storyline
03:19:08 story arc that everybody loves.
03:19:11 So last episode, we said something about maybe my account
03:19:17 was too new to be able to swear on it.
03:19:20 But I was like, that surely can't be the case
03:19:22 because my account was made in like 2009 or something.
03:19:29 But you saying that made me click on my account settings
03:19:33 and I could see my location, which is Japan
03:19:36 because I live in Japan.
03:19:37 What's this guy?
03:19:38 And so I said, well, maybe if I try changing this,
03:19:43 I don't know, just on a whim.
03:19:44 So I changed it to the United States
03:19:47 and tried leaving a comment.
03:19:48 And lo and behold, if your location is set to United States,
03:19:52 you can't swear in comments.
03:19:55 What?
03:19:56 Why are they banning us living in Japan?
03:19:59 All Japanese people are fucking banned from commenting.
03:20:04 But like any English?
03:20:04 Saying fuck in the comments or shit
03:20:06 or any sort of swear word.
03:20:08 But if you're from the United States,
03:20:10 I guess you have the God given rights to say a fuck.
03:20:13 So that's Jeff Dates.
03:20:16 If anybody wants to swear in the comments,
03:20:18 I guess you got to make your location America or something.
03:20:22 Not true because I have a ring.
03:20:25 There's a new wrinkle to this.
03:20:26 And this is bizarre.
03:20:28 I tried to reply to a comment on the PCP channel,
03:20:34 like as the PCP account, into our own comments.
03:20:38 Some guy, some freak in the comments was like,
03:20:42 when I told the story about a Trixie defending May
03:20:46 saying that George Floyd deserved it,
03:20:48 some freak in the comments was like,
03:20:49 George Floyd did deserve it, actually.
03:20:51 And I tried to respond to them with profanity,
03:20:54 with well-deserved profanity that was completely justified
03:20:57 and would have been good.
03:20:58 And I couldn't.
03:21:00 I could not comment on my own YouTube channel.
03:21:03 It deleted the comment from myself.
03:21:07 And we're definitely set to,
03:21:09 I think we're set to Nate's old address,
03:21:11 which is Cincinnati.
03:21:12 So it definitely thinks we're in America.
03:21:15 It deleted our own comment on our own podcast
03:21:19 because it had the F word in it.
03:21:20 And then I re-typed it with no swearing.
03:21:23 And I felt like I wasn't being strongly worded enough,
03:21:26 but whatever.
03:21:27 And it worked.
03:21:29 So I don't know, it's just super fun.
03:21:32 Every time I'm in my after dark account
03:21:34 and I just comment on a video
03:21:36 and I say something about come,
03:21:37 my comment doesn't show up when I refresh.
03:21:40 Yeah, that's what happened.
03:21:42 That's the same thing that happened
03:21:44 with me replying to this guy.
03:21:48 So I don't know if it's, for us,
03:21:52 being located in the United States
03:21:53 does not have any, has not done anything for it.
03:21:57 I don't know.
03:21:58 It's fucked up.
03:21:58 Criminal, what's next?
03:22:00 Swear in the comments, everybody.
03:22:01 Swear like a sailor.
03:22:03 Fuck.
03:22:03 Yeah.
03:22:04 Actually, do like YouTube shorts as comments
03:22:08 because then if it's in a video,
03:22:09 it might be harder for them to delete it.
03:22:12 Next voicemail is called Google Gobble.
03:22:15 Three, two, one, go.
03:22:17 Ben, you are absolutely right.
03:22:19 The Reddit search is fucking dog shit.
03:22:22 And you wanna know why?
03:22:23 It simply doesn't work.
03:22:24 Because they made their own search.
03:22:26 It's not powered by Google.
03:22:28 They tried to do their own shit
03:22:30 and it doesn't fucking work.
03:22:31 Just like all searches not powered by Google.
03:22:34 You know what the answer is?
03:22:35 More monopolization.
03:22:38 Individuals and companies
03:22:40 that are not part of a giant conglomerate.
03:22:43 Finally.
03:22:45 Google, Apple, Disney, Amazon,
03:22:47 Google, Apple, Disney, Amazon.
03:22:50 That was catchy.
03:22:51 That was a catchy tune.
03:22:52 I wanna make a song out of that.
03:22:53 Now I like corporations.
03:22:54 Interest on Google, Apple, Amazon, Disney,
03:22:58 Google, Apple, Amazon, Disney, Google, Apple.
03:23:00 Bass, bass, bass, bass.
03:23:01 Microsoft Activision Bethesda.
03:23:04 Bass, bass, tap, tap, tap, bass, bass, bass,
03:23:07 tap, tap, tap, tap.
03:23:07 Tap, tap, tap, tap, bass.
03:23:08 Um, there.
03:23:09 Fucking old.
03:23:10 I have to say, though, I've noticed
03:23:12 that if you use old.reddit.com,
03:23:16 you can actually still access
03:23:17 like an older version of the Reddit website.
03:23:19 And the search on that version
03:23:20 is 100 times more functional.
03:23:22 You'll actually get results.
03:23:23 If you don't do that, the results, shit.
03:23:26 I use the old, wait, do I?
03:23:28 I'm not sure.
03:23:29 In the URL, it'll say old.reddit.com.
03:23:33 Maybe I, I'm not sure.
03:23:36 I'll have to check.
03:23:36 I'll have to check.
03:23:38 Okay, that's a good tip.
03:23:40 Yeah, I found that because I use it
03:23:42 for like an NSFW Reddit page.
03:23:46 It's like the one I wanted.
03:23:46 You should use it for an NSFT.
03:23:49 Ah, shit.
03:23:51 Mint that shit, dog.
03:23:53 Okay, next one is.
03:23:54 Nice, saggy fucking titties.
03:23:58 Next one is called, did I already,
03:23:59 did I already upload the next one?
03:24:00 Yeah, I did.
03:24:01 Next one is called New Pokemon Game Spoilers.
03:24:03 Three, two, one, go.
03:24:06 It's an isekai.
03:24:08 Been stanked.
03:24:09 Give and take.
03:24:10 It's an isekai.
03:24:13 No, it's not.
03:24:14 It's a time isekai.
03:24:17 Uh, okay.
03:24:17 Did it go through a time?
03:24:18 Did it go through a time portal?
03:24:19 Did the character you play as
03:24:20 has been trying to.
03:24:20 Is it good though?
03:24:21 That's an important problem.
03:24:24 Yeah, that's cute.
03:24:25 That's cute, I guess.
03:24:26 Did you see that they retconned how
03:24:27 Pokeballs work?
03:24:30 What do they do?
03:24:31 All Pokemon have the ability to shrink naturally.
03:24:34 That's just something they can do.
03:24:36 And the Pokeball just traps them in there.
03:24:38 Like they shrink.
03:24:39 It doesn't turn them into energy or anything.
03:24:40 They could just drink and do that.
03:24:43 That's insane.
03:24:44 Okay, that's fine.
03:24:47 Whatever.
03:24:48 It's okay.
03:24:49 I mean, how else did they get them
03:24:53 into apricorn balls?
03:24:55 You know?
03:24:55 Oh, simple.
03:24:56 You turn them into atoms.
03:24:58 You record the atoms and then you recreate them every time.
03:25:00 Oh, magic.
03:25:01 It's like a teleporter.
03:25:03 That would do it, I suppose.
03:25:04 Yeah.
03:25:05 Just say it's magic because they're magical creatures
03:25:07 that shoot lightning at each other.
03:25:10 I mean, when I first...
03:25:13 Well, I think I had this idea years ago
03:25:16 and I can't remember when.
03:25:18 But the idea is that they're...
03:25:20 Pokemon are actually also digital monsters.
03:25:23 But they're not called Digimon.
03:25:25 They're just like, you know, because it's a video game.
03:25:27 But are they the champions?
03:25:28 But they don't present themselves as fake digital monsters
03:25:33 in the canon of the story, so whatever.
03:25:35 I mean, in the canon, you literally store them in a computer.
03:25:39 Yeah.
03:25:40 So it's meant in that way to parallel people
03:25:43 playing the game on their Game Boy Color in real life
03:25:47 because you go around and trade,
03:25:48 just like the people in the game in the Pokemon Center.
03:25:51 They trade Pokemon.
03:25:53 Exactly.
03:25:54 Yeah, whatever.
03:25:54 Pokemon smells.
03:25:56 Diageesis.
03:25:57 It's ARG.
03:25:58 It's not ARG, augmented reality.
03:26:01 So then the next question, I think this person's confused
03:26:04 because the question is called
03:26:05 the question on everyone's mind next week when Gibbon visits.
03:26:09 I don't think you're visiting anywhere next week.
03:26:11 So...
03:26:12 No.
03:26:13 Okay, three, two, one, go.
03:26:17 So, like, you're going to fuck?
03:26:21 You're going to fuck.
03:26:23 This guy must be a bit behind because, like,
03:26:26 you canceled your trip, like, several weeks ago.
03:26:29 I mean, I didn't talk about my trip until it was canceled.
03:26:33 Exactly.
03:26:34 You brought it up to sales.
03:26:35 Maybe they assumed that it was just, like, delayed a week.
03:26:37 And when you, like,
03:26:38 No, no.
03:26:38 When your COVID test came back and you were fine,
03:26:40 they just assumed you were going.
03:26:42 No, no, no.
03:26:43 I'm going to go in the summer.
03:26:44 I have the cost of the ticket.
03:26:48 Totally refunded, completely.
03:26:50 And I can use that cost to buy a new ticket at a different time
03:26:53 in the year.
03:26:54 So...
03:26:54 Clearly this person hasn't played the PCP dating sound.
03:26:57 Clearly.
03:26:59 Also, we have about 10 more.
03:27:00 So we're getting down there, in voicemails.
03:27:03 My dinner's ready.
03:27:03 I want to go and eat.
03:27:06 Okay, okay.
03:27:06 We're almost there.
03:27:07 Speed run.
03:27:08 Next one is called Let's Talk About Race You Lib Tards.
03:27:11 This is at beatmyassatlike.drum.
03:27:15 Three, two, one, go.
03:27:18 Lib Tards like Ben keeps saying it like there is only one race.
03:27:22 The human race.
03:27:23 Bah, bitch.
03:27:25 What about NASCAR?
03:27:27 What about what?
03:27:28 NASCAR.
03:27:29 What about NASCAR?
03:27:31 What?
03:27:31 Oh, that is what's going on.
03:27:32 Yeah, well, they drive around and they...
03:27:34 Yeah, well, what about Formula One, huh?
03:27:37 The better race, the master race.
03:27:39 What about Formula One?
03:27:40 Well, I got a race gone out of here.
03:27:42 It's time for me to leave.
03:27:44 Vroom, vroom, goodbye.
03:27:46 You guys have a good podcast.
03:27:48 Will you actually leave it?
03:27:49 I'm literally leaving now.
03:27:51 Okay.
03:27:51 Okay, goodbye.
03:27:52 See you, beautiful.
03:27:54 All right, well.
03:27:55 See ya.
03:27:56 But...
03:27:58 What a cringe.
03:27:59 Cringe.
03:28:00 Couldn't he...
03:28:00 Couldn't hang it out for the last nine voicemails.
03:28:02 Yeah, fuck.
03:28:04 Yeah, fuck.
03:28:04 Okay.
03:28:06 Good riddance.
03:28:06 Okay, next one is...
03:28:08 Next one is called May Lover At Trad.Wife.
03:28:11 Oh, no.
03:28:12 Also called rampantatmisoginous.ben.
03:28:16 So, you know, take your pick.
03:28:19 Three, two, one, go.
03:28:21 So, that was pretty funny timing with Trixie's
03:28:24 I Hate Digit Broke video, huh?
03:28:26 One week she's explaining how she likes Riley
03:28:29 because he's a pathetic bottom feeder.
03:28:31 Willing, May, begging to gravel at her feet,
03:28:34 licking her soles in parentheses and wash.
03:28:37 Nodding.
03:28:37 For the meager crumbs of clouds she made grand.
03:28:39 I'm nodding.
03:28:40 Next week it goes bust.
03:28:41 That's what I'd call an epically my moment.
03:28:44 Also, Ben, on the last episode you kept insisting
03:28:47 that Trixie must remember all of the things
03:28:49 that caused you two to fall out.
03:28:51 Not all of them.
03:28:51 And she must be lying when she's saying
03:28:53 that she doesn't know why you hate her.
03:28:55 But have you considered that she simply suffered
03:28:57 too much cognitive decline from smoking way too much?
03:29:00 Epic 420.
03:29:01 Your motherfucking boba-booy gang,
03:29:03 we do remember.
03:29:04 You hear that?
03:29:05 Or your brain is just working overtime
03:29:07 bending reality into something that allows her
03:29:09 to sleep that night?
03:29:10 Got aloof of pissing everything and everyone away
03:29:12 for what amounted to a couple of unwatchable vlogs
03:29:15 after all.
03:29:16 Front aloof?
03:29:17 More like frontal cope?
03:29:19 Ha ha ha.
03:29:20 Anyways, the Ig Arc seems to be nearing its end,
03:29:23 but we never learned where the fuck Bird came from.
03:29:25 How did they meet in what kind of black male
03:29:27 does Trixie have on him to make him stay with her?
03:29:30 I know it's the answer to some of these.
03:29:32 I know that Bird is just a big dick show lover.
03:29:38 Bird is just an obsessed dick show fan
03:29:40 and they met at a dick show thing.
03:29:42 That's that's it.
03:29:45 Cool.
03:29:46 Yeah, the cognitive decline weed.
03:29:48 Yeah, that's all probably somewhat true,
03:29:50 but she must remember some of it.
03:29:52 She must remember some of it.
03:29:53 There I feel like there was one other thing.
03:29:55 Okay, the Yig thing.
03:29:59 I saw something Trixie says.
03:30:03 I don't I don't think in Trixie's mind
03:30:05 that Riley quitting means that Yig is over.
03:30:08 She just thinks like Yig is just what she calls the channel now.
03:30:11 Yeah, it's a studio of two people.
03:30:14 Well, one I mean, Bird doesn't do anything.
03:30:16 So it's one person now.
03:30:18 Yeah.
03:30:20 So yeah, I think she would not say,
03:30:24 okay, well, just because Riley's gone,
03:30:25 it's not Yig anymore.
03:30:27 Like it's still Yig.
03:30:28 Although it is funny that in that video,
03:30:30 in the I Hate Didgeridoo video,
03:30:31 she did talk about like how important Riley was
03:30:33 and how they were like doing stuff together
03:30:34 and then he quit like three days later.
03:30:36 This is pretty good.
03:30:37 It's pretty good.
03:30:39 Next one is called...
03:30:40 Oh, by the way, I just want to say
03:30:41 that that AI voice was really good.
03:30:43 It's good.
03:30:44 It was pretty good.
03:30:44 That's great.
03:30:45 It reminded me of Mandy from Billion Mandy.
03:30:48 I don't know actually what it is though.
03:30:50 I'm not, hmm, maybe.
03:30:54 Next one is called...
03:30:56 Wait, what number was that?
03:30:57 We need 86.
03:31:00 Okay, this one is called For Your Cons...
03:31:04 No, stop, stop.
03:31:05 It started playing for me.
03:31:07 Okay, For Your Consideration.
03:31:08 Three, two, one, go.
03:31:11 Long tick stall.
03:31:12 LDS in short is a method of intercourse
03:31:15 where the rhythm is slow but deep in thorough.
03:31:17 It is most effective with a long penis,
03:31:19 preferably inches or more.
03:31:20 The penis is inserted into the vagina
03:31:22 all the way in using a slow, smooth stroke.
03:31:24 You pull out slowly as well,
03:31:26 right until the head of the penis
03:31:27 is about to fall out and then you sink back in slow.
03:31:30 Rinse, repeat.
03:31:31 This is a slow stroke.
03:31:32 You pull out and then you sink back in slow.
03:31:34 Rinse, repeat.
03:31:34 This allows the female to feel
03:31:36 every inch of your long dick.
03:31:37 It also increases effectiveness
03:31:39 by rotating your hips
03:31:40 and doing a stir the coffee motion with your stroke.
03:31:42 Long dicking is only possible
03:31:44 when the man is in a dominant position
03:31:45 where he can control the stroke missionary,
03:31:47 to argue, or lasebone sideways,
03:31:49 playing on and be in matching your stroke
03:31:51 to the bass line of the song
03:31:52 also increases effectiveness.
03:31:54 Be aware of the side effects though.
03:31:55 While long dicking a woman
03:31:56 can greatly increase your chances
03:31:58 of getting breakfast in the morning,
03:31:59 it can also take your relationship
03:32:01 to a whole other level
03:32:02 that you may not want to take.
03:32:03 Unfortunately, that is not a concern for a week.
03:32:05 Limp-wristed be de-mails like Benjamin H.
03:32:07 Say who haven't worked out in over a month.
03:32:10 No.
03:32:14 It's true.
03:32:15 What a wild voice.
03:32:18 Is that meant to be Ben Shapiro's voice?
03:32:21 I think definitely, definitely Ben Shapiro calling me out
03:32:25 for not lifting for a month.
03:32:28 Ben is Ben.
03:32:30 It has been, I think, yeah,
03:32:31 it has been now over a month now.
03:32:32 It's a perfect punchline.
03:32:33 Because I got COVID at the end of December,
03:32:36 so that's pathetic.
03:32:38 Pathetic, Ben.
03:32:40 Next one is called Am I a Pet?
03:32:43 Three, two, one, go.
03:32:46 My cat's litter box is across from my desk
03:32:48 and every time he takes a shit, he looks at me.
03:32:50 Yes, yes, your cat owes you.
03:32:52 Ha, ha, ha.
03:32:53 Who's really in charge?
03:32:54 He commands me for food when it's his time to eat.
03:32:59 And in the mornings, he tells me when my turn
03:33:02 with the bed is over.
03:33:06 Am I a pet?
03:33:07 Just get rid of your cat.
03:33:08 Just get rid of your cat.
03:33:09 Just throw it out.
03:33:09 Just throw it out the window.
03:33:10 Just drop a frying pan in your cat and see what happens.
03:33:12 Just, just, it's simple as that.
03:33:16 Simple as that.
03:33:16 You ever try it?
03:33:17 Don't knock it, don't knock it till you try it.
03:33:21 Okay.
03:33:21 Next one is called Keggs Therapy Session.
03:33:24 Three, two, one, go.
03:33:26 So Keggs Standard, what brings you here today?
03:33:32 It's about my character, Dr. Wolfe.
03:33:34 People around here call me Keggs Standard,
03:33:37 but Keggs is just the character I'm playing.
03:33:39 What exactly are you talking about?
03:33:41 It's like a Stephen Colbert situation,
03:33:44 where Colbert played a right wing dipshit
03:33:46 when he was really a left wing dipshit.
03:33:48 It's the same for me and Keggs.
03:33:50 Even though Keggs is eerily similar to me,
03:33:52 he's an entirely fictionalized character.
03:33:55 I wonder, who am I talking to in this therapy session?
03:33:58 Is it Nate or am I talking to Keggs Standard?
03:34:01 You're talking to Best Guy ever.
03:34:03 Who is Best Guy ever?
03:34:04 Is that also a character you're playing?
03:34:07 Yeah, Best Guy ever is a character.
03:34:09 He's almost entirely identical to me,
03:34:11 right down to the laboratory in worldview.
03:34:13 A lot.
03:34:14 I see, perhaps people are confused
03:34:17 because Best Guy ever and Nate are so similar.
03:34:19 I get where you're coming from.
03:34:21 I don't know if you know this,
03:34:22 but Dr. Wolfe is a character I play.
03:34:25 In real life, I'm a certified accountant.
03:34:28 I'm not a therapist.
03:34:29 But still, people look up to me
03:34:31 because I have years of wisdom that they don't have.
03:34:33 That's a really good point.
03:34:35 I guess I have a ways to go.
03:34:37 I'm out of here.
03:34:38 I have a hot date with Abley Jack.
03:34:43 It's good to be back.
03:34:48 That was very good.
03:34:49 It's so eerie.
03:34:50 It's so eerie that it sounds like
03:34:52 the voice.
03:34:53 Yeah, I mean, it's obviously not.
03:34:55 But then there's like a few brief little bits
03:35:00 where it's like, oh yeah, that's Nate.
03:35:02 Of course.
03:35:03 Yeah, I'm the best guy ever.
03:35:04 That one's a good one.
03:35:07 No.
03:35:07 Like in some words,
03:35:08 some words just sound like he said them,
03:35:10 like kegs sound like he said it.
03:35:13 But like, kegstund.
03:35:16 Kegstund.
03:35:17 Kegstund.
03:35:20 It's just characters within characters.
03:35:22 Nothing is real anymore.
03:35:25 You could make fake weagwis with a nice AI voice.
03:35:29 Make a hole.
03:35:30 Nate should just, you should use that bot
03:35:33 and he should just like feed all his past script
03:35:36 weagwis scripts through like an AI thing
03:35:38 and just generate new ones.
03:35:42 OK, next one we're getting down there
03:35:44 is called PCP TPC logo.
03:35:49 I guess this is a hot topic this week.
03:35:52 Three, two, one, go.
03:35:54 In episode 282, Ben wondered why the PCP logo
03:35:57 had a scribbled over page of the vapors in the background.
03:36:00 And I believe that's because the vape is fucking sucks.
03:36:06 No, no, come on.
03:36:13 OK, next one is called.
03:36:16 Trixie explains a very intellectual joke,
03:36:20 parentheses, she's brain dead.
03:36:22 Three, three, two, one, go.
03:36:26 So the first lyrics here,
03:36:28 you're playing Minecraft in a cave looking for diamonds.
03:36:31 That's funny.
03:36:32 I'm in the same cave looking for minors
03:36:35 because my sexual attraction to minors is major.
03:36:38 Can't even play hopscotch without popping a rager.
03:36:42 Now these lyrics in particular,
03:36:44 I think are obviously meant to be funny.
03:36:47 Oh, this is the Mr. Girl album, the referential.
03:36:50 They have word play, you know, he's looking for minors.
03:36:55 You could imply that he's talking about minors, people who mine,
03:36:58 you know, but because it's Minecraft in particular,
03:37:04 which is known to have a very young fan base,
03:37:07 it's like, OK, that seems to be the implication.
03:37:10 And then, you know, saying my sexual attraction
03:37:13 to minors is major is like.
03:37:16 Why is she just explaining the joke?
03:37:18 Don't have a comparison to majors, you know, if we're talking about.
03:37:22 Oh, my God.
03:37:23 So it only makes sense if he's talking about children.
03:37:26 So that's where you start to go.
03:37:27 Oh, and then can't even play hopscotch
03:37:30 without popping a rager is obviously a joke.
03:37:32 So it's humorous, but any very in your face
03:37:37 and, you know, calling yourself a fucking pedophile kind of way.
03:37:43 No kidding.
03:37:46 I can't believe that's real.
03:37:50 What?
03:37:50 You have that?
03:37:51 What was the context of that?
03:37:53 Why was she explaining an obvious joke?
03:37:56 It's I can't believe she had to explain that.
03:37:59 It is.
03:38:00 It's like it's like, OK, well, the chicken,
03:38:03 when you ask why it crossed the road,
03:38:04 but then the answer is you say cross the road.
03:38:08 And it's like, oh, I wasn't expecting that because it was obvious.
03:38:11 Like it's that level.
03:38:12 That's from the reviewed.
03:38:16 Mr. Girl is some guy who thinks it's really funny
03:38:20 to just say he's a pedophile.
03:38:21 And that's his whole thing.
03:38:22 And also he hates trans people, but never mind that.
03:38:25 And they did a review of his album.
03:38:28 Yeeg reviewed his album and loved it, like gushed over it.
03:38:32 They can't get enough of this fucking freak.
03:38:35 Yeah.
03:38:36 So this is the review of that album.
03:38:38 So great review content.
03:38:42 Guys, it's funny because when he says I'm a minor,
03:38:47 when he says I'm a minor, he's looking for minors,
03:38:49 but not in the way that you might think where it's mining,
03:38:54 like minecraft, he means it.
03:38:57 It's a homonym, you see, for another word,
03:39:00 M-I-N-O-R, meaning a person of underage.
03:39:02 It is not legal to have sexual intercourse with them.
03:39:07 Nevertheless, he implies that that is what he wants to do.
03:39:09 The humor you see comes from the suggestion that he is a pedophile.
03:39:17 Very, very droll, very droll.
03:39:20 I have one.
03:39:21 All right, this is great.
03:39:23 I have one comment to say.
03:39:25 She made a video, she released a video about Diddy Kong racing.
03:39:28 It got like 3,000 views.
03:39:30 Nobody watched it.
03:39:32 It was obviously meant, it was very obviously
03:39:35 like her trying to do a Hazel video.
03:39:37 It was very clear.
03:39:38 Someone in the chat said, this is just like Hazel.
03:39:42 And she said, no, this is not like Hazel.
03:39:46 This is me attempting to do Civvie, Civvie 11.
03:39:50 And I don't know if you've ever seen Civvie 11,
03:39:52 but Civvie 11, he's like a comedy guy.
03:39:56 He does, he does game, let's play.
03:39:58 He does like commentary, plays through a game and comments on it,
03:40:02 but he like lampoons it.
03:40:03 He's a comedy guy.
03:40:04 Her video is like obviously not.
03:40:06 There was no comedy and no jokes at all.
03:40:08 And it was, and it's like, it was really weird.
03:40:11 Like you could just admit you're doing Hazel.
03:40:14 Why, why pretend?
03:40:16 No, I'm this, no, actually, I'm pretending.
03:40:18 I'm trying to rip off this other guy, but like it's not.
03:40:22 I don't know.
03:40:22 It was, if you don't, I don't know.
03:40:25 The con, you maybe have to know, if you're familiar with Civvie.
03:40:28 And if you're familiar with Civvie and you heard her say,
03:40:31 no, this, this is my attempt at a Civvie style video.
03:40:34 You would just be like, it's obviously not.
03:40:36 Like if there's no, there's no similarity other than the fact
03:40:38 that you're talking about a game.
03:40:40 It reminded me of, it reminded me of when somebody asked,
03:40:44 people said, people accused Chris Chan of,
03:40:47 they were saying, Sonichu is a rip-off.
03:40:49 It's a rip-off because you, here, you just,
03:40:52 you just mashed together Sonic and Pikachu.
03:40:54 Even the name, the name is just Sonic and Pikachu
03:40:56 mashed together into Sonichu.
03:40:58 And Chris Chan said, no, no, no, you fool.
03:41:00 You see actually the name Sonichu comes from the,
03:41:05 the Japanese name for Sonic, Sonichu, you see.
03:41:09 So, aha, I gotcha.
03:41:11 And it's like, shut up.
03:41:12 What are you talking about?
03:41:14 Why?
03:41:14 Why are you lying?
03:41:16 Literally, why lie?
03:41:17 I don't know, whatever.
03:41:20 Anyway, great voicemail.
03:41:22 I loved it.
03:41:22 Pretty good.
03:41:24 Yeah.
03:41:25 Next one is Baby in a Blender Emotional.
03:41:30 Oh, this is a, this is a Vokeru link.
03:41:33 Here it is.
03:41:35 Three, two, one, go.
03:42:05 Baby in a Blender Emotional.
03:42:11 It really, it really liked that little
03:42:13 Carlos Santana riff in the middle there.
03:42:15 Holy moly.
03:42:21 Good one.
03:42:22 Next one is called Rod Serling, coming of 300.
03:42:28 Three, two, one, go.
03:42:35 Imagine if you will, the Procrastinator's podcast,
03:42:38 episode three, double O.
03:42:40 I don't want to.
03:42:41 Everyone is here.
03:42:43 Davoo, Tom, Simsie, Cybershell, Oblivionfall.
03:42:47 It's like a goddamn multiverse fighting game,
03:42:50 except without the concerning community presence of minors.
03:42:53 Gave us excited to record.
03:42:55 Which kind of minors do you mean, though?
03:42:57 Any of his many guests yet.
03:42:59 But wait, was there not a prophecy?
03:43:02 A wording that implied that he was coming?
03:43:06 Joining the call to the horror of everyone
03:43:09 is Nate the Body Saint Himself.
03:43:11 The Body.
03:43:11 The video goes live the next week,
03:43:13 and what they all feared was true.
03:43:16 No, Nate.
03:43:16 Yes, watch.
03:43:18 Zero likes and zero views.
03:43:21 No.
03:43:23 Horrifying.
03:43:27 Worst fate I cannot imagine.
03:43:30 Yeah, not gonna happen, bro.
03:43:32 Twilight Zone episode where a YouTuber
03:43:35 enters the Twilight Zone,
03:43:36 but the only difference is all their videos
03:43:40 just get zero views.
03:43:42 And they go, ah.
03:43:44 They keep gaining subscribers,
03:43:46 getting less views every day.
03:43:47 It doesn't make any sense.
03:43:48 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
03:43:50 It's like everyone's talking about their videos.
03:43:52 Everyone's like talking about them on 4chan and stuff.
03:43:54 They got a Kiwi Farms thread.
03:43:55 Everyone's talking about them,
03:43:56 but no views.
03:43:57 Nobody's watching.
03:43:58 No views.
03:43:59 How does anyone know about it?
03:44:01 They're talking about it,
03:44:02 and it's like, if they're talking about it,
03:44:04 like it's a completely different video.
03:44:05 They're just saying things that weren't in there,
03:44:07 and you're just like, no.
03:44:08 No, that's not what my video was.
03:44:10 And their Patreon starts draining money
03:44:11 from them instead of giving it to them.
03:44:14 Yeah.
03:44:17 Next one is called, is this today?
03:44:20 Okay, next one is called I Did It.
03:44:22 We've got three more.
03:44:23 I Did It.
03:44:24 Three, two, one, go.
03:44:31 What is it?
03:44:43 Hello, comrades.
03:44:45 Nikolai found vodka.
03:44:46 Now, Nikolai, okay.
03:44:48 You just want,
03:44:49 Nikolai just wanted to let you know
03:44:50 that Nikolai considered you all comrades.
03:44:52 Oh, cool.
03:44:53 Thanks, com.
03:44:53 Even if you are a dirty capitalist.
03:44:56 Thanks, comrade.
03:44:57 Thanks, comrade Nikolai.
03:45:00 Thank you.
03:45:01 I love you.
03:45:02 That's the worst Russian action I've ever heard in my life.
03:45:06 Don't invade Ukraine, please.
03:45:08 Yeah, don't.
03:45:09 Okay.
03:45:10 I don't think you should do that.
03:45:11 I think that would be bad.
03:45:14 In my opinion.
03:45:16 The Ukraine has UK in it,
03:45:18 and that reminds me of my country where I live,
03:45:21 and that's scary.
03:45:22 And how would you like it if Russia invaded your country?
03:45:25 Oh, I would be so sad.
03:45:28 Yeah, you better, you better watch it.
03:45:32 Next, next one is called
03:45:34 Wong-Chan is back.
03:45:36 Three, two, one, go.
03:45:48 Flo, it is Wong-Chan.
03:45:50 I'm doing good.
03:45:51 Thank you.
03:45:52 How are you?
03:45:55 What the fuck was the point of that?
03:45:56 Yeah.
03:45:57 It's just the point is to be a racist caricature,
03:46:00 and then say hello.
03:46:01 All right, yeah.
03:46:02 And then say hi.
03:46:03 I'm doing good.
03:46:04 Thanks, Wong-Chan.
03:46:05 How are you?
03:46:06 Yeah, Wong-Chan, you know, I'm sorry,
03:46:09 I'm sorry that God made you like this
03:46:12 as such a racist caricature of your own race.
03:46:14 You know, it's not your fault.
03:46:15 You didn't, you didn't choose to be like this.
03:46:19 And why would I judge, and how can I judge you for that?
03:46:23 God bless.
03:46:23 Next voicemail.
03:46:25 God bless.
03:46:27 Happy Chinese New Year,
03:46:29 Mahal, Ni Hao, Happy Chinese New Year, Wong-Chan.
03:46:33 Last voicemail.
03:46:35 This is breaking news.
03:46:37 It's called breaking news.
03:46:38 Three, two, one, go.
03:46:41 Guys, guys, breaking news.
03:46:45 No, fucking Riley said that.
03:46:47 Fucking void gazers is canceled.

03:46:52 Have Trixie.
03:46:53 No, have Riley on.
03:46:55 Yeah, yeah.
03:46:57 This guy's brain's going a mile a minute.
03:47:00 He sounded like ABGN at the last we go, yeah.
03:47:05 Riley on the procrastinator's podcast.
03:47:09 Can we get him?
03:47:10 Can we, can we afford him?
03:47:11 I don't know if we can afford him.
03:47:14 He listened to the last episode, he was mad.
03:47:16 He was, he was, he was mauled tweeting about it on Twitter.
03:47:19 He gets to produce the next episode.
03:47:21 That's good enough.
03:47:22 We can let him produce the next episode.
03:47:26 I guess that's it.
03:47:26 That was the last voicemail.
03:47:27 We're done.
03:47:28 That'll do.
03:47:28 We did it.
03:47:29 That will do.
