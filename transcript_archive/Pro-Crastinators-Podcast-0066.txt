00:00:00 Can you believe all the money we're making from these ridiculous pony videos?
00:00:04 Stocks, bonds, drugs, blood diamonds, nothing's made dividends like this before.
00:00:24 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:29 I am the best guy ever and also here's Hippocrit.
00:00:34 Cash money and such.
00:00:36 And that's it. We're the only guys here, that's it.
00:00:38 So let's move ahead here.
00:00:39 Oh, that's the party fucker to the party cash.
00:00:41 IT'S ME!
00:00:42 Oh, what do you know?
00:00:44 PURSING IN THROUGH THE SEALING!
00:00:48 I was parachuting and I just figured I should get out now before the instructor got too mad at me.
00:00:56 And here I am.
00:00:59 Well alright, just in time.
00:01:01 Why was he getting mad at you?
00:01:03 I figured if I waited too long he'd be like, why aren't you jumping out so I better go early so he wouldn't get mad.
00:01:11 What was that voice that I heard from under the door that we locked to keep him out?
00:01:15 Oh, it's Ben St.
00:01:17 Hey, let me just roll on in here and say that I'll probably be leaving a little early because Nate's technical issues have forced a scheduling conflict.
00:01:26 Because around 7 today I'm going to be over fucking streaming video games streaming you, me, Nicky on twitch.tv.
00:01:33 So if you're in the future, go back to watch me.
00:01:35 Yeah, I'll join stream.
00:01:37 Yeah, you should all join the stream by the way.
00:01:40 Oh hey guys.
00:01:42 Sorry I'm late, my dad was taking me in the city to see a marching band.
00:01:47 He said son, when you grow up would you be the leader of the broken.
00:01:51 It's beaten in the damn, he said will you defeat them, your demons and all the non-believers, the plans that they have made because one day I'll leave you a phantom to lead you in the summer to join the black raid.
00:01:58 And that's why he appeared, he tellturnism is bad.
00:02:02 Busted, Nate, busted.
00:02:04 I just, I just, I don't associate that song with anything except Gern Lagen.
00:02:08 Is that, I mean-
00:02:09 I associate that with the freshman year of high school.
00:02:12 Munchy, have you not seen this girl, I gotta link it to you, it's like the greatest thing ever made.
00:02:17 It's just, it so perfectly fits with the, with like the Simone common relationship.
00:02:21 Okay, let's move on.
00:02:22 The Simone.
00:02:23 Can we, can we-
00:02:24 From Moana.
00:02:25 Can we have a peek behind the curtain real quick and say this is not the first PCP episode we've recorded today?
00:02:31 Very true, everybody.
00:02:32 I had technical issues, my computer died.
00:02:34 We recorded a grand episode about Nate's weird utilitarian principles.
00:02:39 So grand.
00:02:40 Yeah, it was actually really great and when we're all real fucking bummed that it's lost forever and no one will ever hear it.
00:02:46 I, I, I object to even mentioning it because then we might not make it in the future, but we'll try again.
00:02:52 I'm gonna upload my audio and I'm gonna let the audience try to piece together.
00:02:55 Really?
00:02:56 Piece together what was going on.
00:02:58 Why would you all upload our audio separately?
00:03:00 I made some really great points.
00:03:02 Yeah, everyone upload their separately on their channels.
00:03:04 It's a good idea.
00:03:05 I'll try to recover mine too and upload mine separately.
00:03:07 Nate, don't even try to recover it because I-
00:03:10 It'll be like an ARG.
00:03:11 Yeah.
00:03:12 Whoa, that's a good idea.
00:03:13 But we spoiled it for everybody.
00:03:14 Okay, well too bad.
00:03:15 Maybe within the week until this goes live, people will be wondering what the fuck these audio's are.
00:03:21 Excellent.
00:03:22 Okay, everybody, but we're not talking about that today.
00:03:24 Instead we're gonna talk about money.
00:03:26 Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money.
00:03:30 Insert cash register sound effect.
00:03:32 Is that, is that ruffling?
00:03:33 What's that?
00:03:34 Is that the ruffling of the cash?
00:03:35 Yeah, what's that ruffling of the cash?
00:03:36 Yep, that's, that was my money.
00:03:38 That's Ben rubbing all the IOU's together that he has.
00:03:41 Ben who Ben who hates
00:03:44 Dollars and loves coins would never
00:03:47 Yeah, yeah, I wish I just had a big sack of like weird like ring coins and just things all the time to carry
00:03:55 I never want to see you fail as long as I live
00:03:58 That is it does make more impressive sounds that you do things with it like that. Yeah, there we go
00:04:03 Oh, yeah, it's like a pirate sound you put a sack of gold on the table
00:04:07 Parts knew what was up. They were smart. So okay, here we go. So here's the the Urban Dictionary definition of money everybody
00:04:13 Okay, money that which allows lazy people to do stupid things without painful consequences thus keeping them forever stupid
00:04:22 Here's the example. It's not the love of money. That is the root of all evil, but rather the lack of it
00:04:27 It's not wrong to have money. It's wrong for money to have you
00:04:31 Hey money is the root of all evil is a misquote and I can't remember what the actual quote is
00:04:36 But I know it's love of all money is the root of all it makes sense said Jesus to me right now
00:04:42 Yeah, money is I like it
00:04:45 So as you can guess we did not have much time to think about this ahead of time. So let's just jump into it
00:04:51 Let's talk about my accounts. I have a big bank account. Go go fund my bank account
00:04:56 Here's my account info paid for the PCP last month. Let's see. Yeah
00:05:00 Share our detailed financials. That's what this episode. Yeah, I got one hundred seventy five dollars
00:05:07 Link in the description to our bank account, which you can feel free to just have at withdraw from what's your favorite?
00:05:16 password the ease for your bank
00:05:22 Top ten my bank password
00:05:25 My top ten account passwords and that's a good one. That's a good video. I should do that before I die
00:05:32 That's actually a great idea. Okay, so let's talk. So is money the root of all evil? No, it's great
00:05:37 I hate money money
00:05:39 Causes me more stress than anything else in my whole life. I don't know whatever I hear anybody be like guys
00:05:44 Wouldn't it be great if we eliminated money? I just think you're an idiot. You don't know share life
00:05:49 The fact that I that I need money is what causes me the stress not the fact that it exists. Okay, okay?
00:05:56 Yeah, I feel that way
00:05:57 I would like I would like a nice comfortable sort of amount of money where I'm like well
00:06:02 I'm not gonna die tomorrow. So that's good
00:06:05 I'm you know me and me and DeVoo talked about this a bunch when I was living at Digi house when both of us were living at Digi house
00:06:12 DeVoo would sometimes get on this tub subject of a what's like universal minimum income
00:06:18 We're like just basic income. Yeah universal basic income where everyone it's just like, you know like like
00:06:25 Social programs are are less social programs are cut
00:06:28 But just everyone gets like you know a small but livable income maybe like
00:06:33 $20,000 something a year and
00:06:36 Like you if you make up for it else and like God, I wish that was the world we lived in no
00:06:41 I don't know
00:06:44 Set he'd be perfect. That'd be a big race
00:06:47 I wouldn't have to worry about anything I could just do my art and be happy a lot of the time
00:06:51 I think of like like people who are on hard times
00:06:55 But they never seem to be like suddenly homeless like actually completely homeless with no money and no way to make any
00:07:04 I know I like about Ben though
00:07:07 It's just I like that Ben is a Ben is realistic and is willing to downscale his life
00:07:13 With you know like having made less money
00:07:15 What I what I hate is what or what I think is is wrong or silly of people to do is to like expect
00:07:21 Everything and then also like not realize that like oh well
00:07:25 I'm not generating enough value to deserve these things like Ben is willing to eat trash and live
00:07:30 You know on the streets. Yeah, it's like I only make zero dollars. This is what I prefer it
00:07:35 Yeah, exactly, you know that's like he's he's correctly scaling his expectations to reality, which is good
00:07:42 I think so I like to think so
00:07:45 It seems that way anyway, I think poor people, you know, I I think poor people should be eliminated
00:07:52 Because here's what poor people do they will walk into a
00:07:58 I didn't
00:08:01 Even able to make half my point now. I can't remember what it was. I'm just really mad
00:08:06 You just
00:08:10 Something about like homeless I don't know if you suddenly if you suddenly if there are people on the on the on the on the streets
00:08:17 And I've been like there for years suddenly giving them a paycheck. I don't know what they would do with it
00:08:22 Oh, so you're saying that like even if we gave, you know, even if even if suddenly there was a there was a not
00:08:27 There was like a livable wage for everybody
00:08:29 I don't know whether that much would change like people would no not a bit more not that much
00:08:36 Yeah, but it would just but I just wanted to be good for people like me
00:08:41 So that's why I want like I don't care about anything else. Obviously. I mean, I know Tavu has some weird like
00:08:48 Things that are like that. I mean, I only say weird because I don't understand them
00:08:51 I don't know if they're actually like incorrect or not
00:08:53 But like he's got some justification for universal basic income based on like it would free up people to work on the things
00:08:59 They really want to do
00:09:02 Because that's what it would do to me. Yeah, I mean, you know, it makes sense
00:09:05 But the only thing is
00:09:07 Like so universal basic income definitely makes sense in a situation just where there's like mass unemployment due to like
00:09:14 Technological evolution or whatever. It's just you know, like we don't need like a thousand billion McDonald's employees anymore
00:09:20 We've got robots. They they've got it under control. So like that's you know
00:09:23 And that puts like a million people out of work or whatever
00:09:25 But but like up until that point where like things are covered by robots
00:09:29 If you give people universal basic income like there's not going to be value generated
00:09:34 So it's like the society will suffer and could get weighed down by that shit. It's like there needs to be
00:09:40 Is they were already spending like a million fucking dollars on like, you know, I don't know a stuff
00:09:47 Stuff that the government does that like that like this would be like this would be paid for by cutting those other programs
00:09:54 You know what I like about this though
00:09:56 This puts the responsibility on people to manage their shit properly and then I don't have to feel bad for them anymore
00:10:02 Yeah, you know, I feel like it should at least be something you have to sign up for like just fill in some paperwork
00:10:08 If you can't read if you can't write
00:10:11 No school. No, no, wait wait
00:10:14 Here's what it is. Here's what it is
00:10:16 If you can't read or write you get free school until you can and then from there
00:10:20 Okay, you get you get like a little bit of money and then you can just you're supposed to like you'd be incentivized to do stuff
00:10:26 You go to because like okay, if you get money some people some people will definitely just live and do nothing forever
00:10:32 What if you're just retarded though like literally you're actually mentally challenged about those people?
00:10:37 Well, you get some of that money and you spend it on
00:10:40 Yeah, but they won't know how to do any of that shit. They'll need they'll need care
00:10:43 Guys, let me clear this up with what I think is a far more intelligent solution instead of just giving people
00:10:50 $20,000 a year retarded because the thing about money is you can buy whatever the fuck you want with that
00:10:55 If we're gonna give people handouts, it should be a universal housing and universal like food and water
00:11:01 Don't give them just straight up money so they can go buy fucking anime books and I'll say I disagree with that
00:11:05 I disagree then you're fucking retarded
00:11:07 No, I want I'd be fine with just being housing and food allowances
00:11:11 I I want those people to die who can't who can't make that shit happen
00:11:15 I want them to die and be and remove themselves from the gene pool
00:11:21 Why yeah, why is that crazy why?
00:11:26 What category of people are you right?
00:11:29 These people who squander their universe. Yeah, sorry
00:11:33 I was trying to explain what you were going, but you've seen it says fine
00:11:37 Yeah, I was just saying people who cannot manage their life
00:11:39 They're like 30 grand basic minimum income with the ability to go out and earn more if they want to those people if they can't handle that
00:11:47 They should die. I mean I agree that everybody who gets a gender studies degree should die
00:11:51 But I don't I think that's a little too extreme though. No, see here's the thing
00:11:55 I don't like about universal basic income. What like we've kind of structured society in a way that everybody just gets to live
00:12:01 Like we will take care of everybody. I don't like that. Some people should die
00:12:05 Some people should be weeded out fucking crazy. No, but they're weeded out by their own decision-making
00:12:11 No, they're not like we're killing them. No, they fucking aren't there
00:12:14 Well, they're weeded out because they because they don't have a family support network or because they just happen to get sick
00:12:20 Or because they're mentally ill things like that. Well, free will isn't real either. So, you know, none of this
00:12:26 We have control
00:12:35 Totally
00:12:38 This is why we needed that podcast because it's just gonna keep coming up
00:12:41 Of course. Do you want to actually go back now? I think the mood is set again. We have to go back
00:12:49 Here's my thing about money
00:12:51 I
00:12:53 like coins
00:12:57 And I'm with you so far
00:13:00 Did any of you as kids have like a big thing of pennies? Did you just have a load of pennies?
00:13:06 Sure
00:13:09 Yeah, they have pennies. Yeah, oh, it's called the same thing. It is called the same thing
00:13:13 You have sense we have pennies and everything is also called pennies. It's just like five pennies five pennies
00:13:18 Is Abraham Lincoln your pennies too?
00:13:20 No, it's the Queen the Queen's all about money. Is a pens the same thing as a penny?
00:13:26 One pence one penny. Yeah
00:13:29 But you call it sense you just change the P to a C
00:13:34 Yeah, you know what they say in for a penny in for a pence. That's the expression
00:13:41 All right, I wasn't gonna talk about not know this
00:13:48 All right now I like I like I forgot what I was gonna say, but I like coins
00:13:53 I'll just go back to that that classic
00:13:56 That's that classic tried-and-true tested debate topic. I love coins. Uh, they're good
00:14:01 I like oh, yeah, the pennies thing
00:14:03 Did any of you have like like I had like a treasure chest full of pennies and I and I
00:14:08 Cashed it into the bank one day and it wasn't even that much and I really I really I really am upset
00:14:16 Treasure chest it was a little little wooden treasure chest with a lock and I had a padlock and it was just full of pennies
00:14:21 And it just felt so dude. You know I felt so wealthy. I did yeah
00:14:25 I felt so wealthy having that chest, but my parents told me you know
00:14:29 That's worth money and you can have it and I'm like whoa
00:14:32 So I did and it was like I don't know a couple a couple quid a couple pounds like not even five pounds
00:14:38 Maybe and now I'm sad that I don't have a pirate chest
00:14:41 I do have a related question for everybody if we want to go around the horn based off what hippo just said
00:14:48 And hopefully this is relevant for most of you if you got like for your birthday you get money
00:14:53 Like at the edge of like 10 to 12. What did you spend that money on?
00:14:58 Saved in one time. I went to I went to a hallmark and I spent literally
00:15:05 $100 on webcams
00:15:07 Just webcams. What are those a webkin you mother fuck is that a stone?
00:15:14 Webkins are
00:15:16 All right
00:15:18 Here I'm gonna red pillion webkins
00:15:21 All right, please
00:15:23 You would be a little lad a little boy or a girl or maybe even both and you would walk into it
00:15:30 You would walk into a store and there you would see them the webkin and he would
00:15:35 And they would smile upon you gleefully and with it with the with the tint in their eyes where you know
00:15:40 They mean fucking business basically there's these they're there these little like stuffed animals
00:15:45 And they look fucked up and like fucking like battered like like crazy housewives fucking Los Angeles and and they like
00:15:52 They're all like tie-dyed and shit
00:15:54 They're like mystical and magical and frivolous and you would buy these you would buy them and and and there'd be like like
00:16:01 Like fucking like 15 or $20 like like a lot for like a teddy bear or something or like a cat
00:16:06 And then you would buy them and then they would have a special code and you would go online to webkins
00:16:12 www.webkins.gov and
00:16:14 And you would enter in the this is a government program. Yeah, you would enter in webkins would be cut to pay for a universal
00:16:23 No, we have to abandon that
00:16:25 Yeah, that motherfucker that guy and he would get him and he would put the code in and then he would be like hello
00:16:31 I'm alive inside the computer. I will I will transmit my code into your soul now
00:16:37 And and impressive it's like a soul augmentation program, right? Okay, is it is it like beanie babies for the modern age?
00:16:45 Is that yes? Yeah, and you like put them in rooms and you could like make their rooms look cool
00:16:50 And you could like it was like Animal Crossing
00:16:52 But you had to like get like a fucking like thing in real life. So they're kind of like amiibo
00:16:56 So yeah, yeah trainer amiibo, and yeah
00:16:58 They live inside of a virtual world and you can like see them growing you can play games with them
00:17:02 I would always play this one game where it was like I would go into the fucking like King Solomon's minds
00:17:06 And I would like work my little baby hands until I would fucking cried myself
00:17:11 All over your web was doing slave labor. Yeah, yeah, exactly and I liked it. I liked it like that. I liked being a slave
00:17:20 I was a slave to my own desires, and you know what it worked down the end like what's that?
00:17:26 There was like like that that minigame
00:17:28 It was like an old like asshole like southern like fucking like a big it like fucking confederate sold your dog there
00:17:33 It was like working my minds and maybe you'll fucking not be a slave one day
00:17:39 Wow, and and I did it ever feels like
00:17:43 Yeah, that's what it means to be a slave
00:17:45 And then I always work and I was trying to get like fucking like like heart scales basically I can never get any
00:17:51 I only got like fucking like shoes and like fucking like three dollars, and it was well wait you made money
00:17:56 There's a return on investment here. No, well first of all money like super much like webkins money, okay?
00:18:02 So like Bitcoin
00:18:05 I got I got payment and dogecoin
00:18:09 That's worth 20 times Bitcoin as I understand like when you win the sled game on Club Penguin. Yeah, exactly
00:18:15 Yeah, yeah, and a base. Yeah, it's like web. It's like Club Penguin, but like better because it's webkins
00:18:20 And like it's I know a certain hippo who would probably argue against you on that one sucker
00:18:26 I don't know whether hippo's played
00:18:30 Fiona the hippo world's famous hippo yesterday at the Cincinnati Zoo. Oh, yeah
00:18:35 It was cool. She was a little rambunctious dude. She was hanging out with her mom and papa
00:18:40 That's nothing to do with what we're talking about. Yeah, but then again now that is webkins, so
00:18:44 Let's
00:18:45 What did you waste your money on?
00:18:48 Right without question. It was always video games every single time I would buy mostly like I could afford
00:18:53 I would spend my money on like GBA games because they were generally cheap
00:18:57 Yeah, like every every birthday or like Christmas. I could usually cash in for exactly one video game no matter what it cost
00:19:03 I mean, they were generally like 60 bucks, but nonetheless, I would use my money
00:19:07 Really that much back then. They're like 40 bucks shit 40 bucks
00:19:10 Yeah, you know, but I would scrape together my money and I would buy fucking Mario and Luigi Superstar saga the greatest game ever made or
00:19:18 Fuck what else? I don't know Castlevania. I would always buy the new Castlevania's on GBA. It was the greatest games of all time
00:19:24 Shit like that. So it was always video games. So that's my answer. That's a complete long and short of it
00:19:29 I
00:19:33 Shout out to Castlevania circle of the moon
00:19:36 I would um always save any money I got from birthdays because I
00:19:41 Ever since ever since my parents said oh, we can't afford that at anything
00:19:45 I was like wait, you can't you can't get this thing that I would like you to get for me
00:19:51 And then it was disturbing and then I learned that things can cost a hundred pounds
00:19:56 And I was like no no one is ever gonna spend any of this money. I'm getting I have to keep all of it
00:20:01 So I just kept putting it in my bank account and I have thousands upon thousands
00:20:05 Well, not that many but like what was your what was your goal with this just to have it to save it
00:20:09 I mean as a kid. I just thought well my parents buy things for me
00:20:12 Anyway, so if I get money from my other relatives, I don't need to spend it
00:20:16 I just need to you know, just sort of sort of wait wait around and then parents
00:20:19 So your answer to what did I buy as a kid is I didn't buy I didn't buy anything. I just got shit
00:20:24 I'm I'm a I'm a I was a clever Jew as I wish I was as smart as hippo because regretfully
00:20:30 I spent all of my childhood money buying yugioh tins
00:20:34 Which were never worth it
00:20:36 And now every single card I own is worthless and I I couldn't sell it if I found the biggest fan of the world
00:20:42 It it was the worst investment a young boy could ever make
00:20:46 Oh my god about magic dude should have invested in magic the gathering that would have paid I bought I bought magic the gathering
00:20:51 I just remembered like the most wasteful thing that I spent my money on I did I did spend some money on it
00:20:57 But mostly it was something that I would use my like, you know Christmas and birthday gifts
00:21:02 Like like credits as or such as they are for
00:21:06 Um fucking fucking dungeons and dragons
00:21:09 Uh like splat books and rule books. I always wanted more of them. I ate that shit up
00:21:15 Um god, it's embarrassing. Cool. Huh. Do you still have them?
00:21:20 Yeah, there's a huge fucking pile of them in my parents house
00:21:23 Some of those were e fucking sensual the manual of the planes is a is a wonderful book just to read
00:21:31 Some of them are just fun to read like some like they have rules in them
00:21:35 And it's like that's fine
00:21:36 But some of them are just like lore and it like goes into like each one of the each one of the planes and like talks about
00:21:41 What monsters and what gods live there? There's a lot of creativity there and I really think those are fun as fuck
00:21:46 Some of them
00:21:48 I want to get into but I don't know how and I don't know how to
00:21:52 To get into dungeons and dragons. Well, here's the free get all those rule books like the free on the
00:21:57 Disclaimer disclaimer. Don't get into dungeons and dragons. It's actually a shit game that sucks
00:22:02 Um, yeah, and like any any any any any suggestion to the contrary is the product of memes and stock homes
00:22:09 It's what I mean by that is that I I would like to be able to say
00:22:15 You know, I kind of get what the whole lore of dungeons and dragons is if there is like a consistent law
00:22:20 I know there are like different books. Well, there's a saying this is this is this is like the book of this
00:22:24 And then another book will reference that book a bit so they're sort of connected, but not really
00:22:29 There are a few there are a few like worlds that like certain books are specifically made for and or in
00:22:37 but like
00:22:38 I mean
00:22:40 They all conflict with each other
00:22:42 I feel like if I want to be get it be good at world building. I might have to read a few of those
00:22:47 Forgive me if I wrong. Yes
00:22:50 A dungeon and dragons to like make your own story. It's like you make your own thing
00:22:54 Oh people need not always need a bit of guidance
00:22:57 I guess is the point and some people just want to buy these like pre-made stories and just play along with them
00:23:02 Like remember that one about that that drow elf guy drizz it or whatever who was so popular
00:23:05 Yeah, I know people would just buy lore books to read. I always wanted I always wanted
00:23:10 Like to be in a game like like a professionally made campaign like a professionally made adventure with like
00:23:17 Because like the professionally made ones are better like they're just better
00:23:20 But nobody wants to buy them because someone wants to DM and people want to tell their own shitty stories around your fucking
00:23:27 a basement dining room table
00:23:29 and
00:23:31 like
00:23:32 I feel like I missed out because
00:23:34 Like one time I played a pre-made adventure that like came in a box and I was like this thing is so robust
00:23:40 There's like there's just so much more to do like it's so much more engaging than just the shitty nothing
00:23:45 Whatever that my that my jerk-off friend here has has prepared for my enjoyment. Fuck that guy. Say my name. Say my name
00:23:54 Munchy munchy. It's me. I DM you already said webkins
00:23:58 Uh, no, no, no, I'm telling Ben to name that guy by name so we can make one of them
00:24:04 All of them. Oh, yes, just like everyone. It's just everyone. Just nobody makes good d&d campaign
00:24:08 I nobody makes them. I didn't even know there was
00:24:11 Like lore to dragons dragons. I thought I was just like a rule dragons and dragons. Yeah
00:24:17 Well, that's what we're talking about, right?
00:24:18 Some dungeons and dragons you clawed you colossal weight some of the books describe like a specific setting
00:24:25 But not but like you don't have to play it in that setting if you don't want to
00:24:29 Yeah, I thought I didn't I thought it was just like a rule set for like anything
00:24:33 I thought I thought the mother
00:24:36 There's a whole pantheon of gods and shit and like
00:24:39 The way spoonie
00:24:41 Explained it in his uh series about dungeons and dragons makes it seem like it's really cool. Well, he's wrong
00:24:48 I promise you he's wrong
00:24:50 Well, yeah, I mean, I'm sure it's it's not cool, but it's like cool to have a story to say and then this happened
00:24:56 Although I kind of want to go watch those that video now
00:24:59 Uh, all right, let's move on to the next one. No, no, no, no, just really just really just really just really quick
00:25:04 Wait, all right, what is it? I I wanted I want to be in a spur
00:25:08 Dungeons and dragons thing. Oh god only only I got to never
00:25:13 My dammit, Nate
00:25:15 I yeah, I was thinking about spurred the other day and I was thinking I am such a genius
00:25:20 That was good. Remember how like early on some of the like role playing sessions
00:25:24 We did over text to simulate uh pester logs. Yep. Yeah, I am the greatest. Yeah, those are great
00:25:31 If we ever
00:25:33 And the pcp of course is the thing we have to do that. I will force you to do it
00:25:37 Then I will not you will not have to say in it. You know what? Yeah, I'm not gonna say that I would never do
00:25:43 Like a spur with the pcp
00:25:46 I would if I could find an excuse to do it
00:25:49 So yeah, I mean that one's was actually fun because we didn't give a fuck about although. No, wait. D&D actually has
00:25:54 Yeah, well, I mean there's already horse stuck
00:25:57 Well, yeah, but I don't get to play as my guy. Yeah, horse stuck is just Gibbs thing basically, you know
00:26:03 Well, no, no
00:26:05 I could like have a bit where you I I could have like a like a you skip ahead and then there's like a big area
00:26:10 Where you could have a gorgeous. Let's talk about this another time
00:26:15 I don't care about money. This is way more fun. Well, this is not the time to discuss the details. I have possible future work
00:26:21 Yes, it is
00:26:23 I can't think of a better time a tangentially related topic of money that we were talking about
00:26:27 We're talking about, you know, things we spent birthday money on what about the biggest waste of money of all time that we have spent
00:26:35 Sure
00:26:37 I've got a great answer for this and I think about it all the time and how much I regret it
00:26:41 I spent 100 american dollars as a little baby boy
00:26:46 At king Richard's fair at this giant floppy black leather match
00:26:50 Because I want it to look like vampire hunter d more than anything. I remember that hat. I remember I still have this hat
00:26:57 It's dusty as fuck. It's huge. It's even better. Hilarious listeners. Let me just personally assure you is even better than than you are imagining
00:27:06 It's amazing. It's I'll do a vampire to d cosplay someday and use it just to justify the purchase
00:27:11 Uh at king Richard's fair, which by the way king Richard's fair is like a renaissance fair thing that they have near us
00:27:17 It's pretty it's pretty cool
00:27:20 they uh
00:27:21 I spent 90 dollars on a on a like on like a
00:27:26 Smith uh metal flanged mace, which I named which I named leopold
00:27:32 Uh and and leopold is I guess probably sitting in my in the closet of our parents house right now
00:27:37 Haven't seen him in a while, but he's my faithful companion and if I in a time someday in a time of need
00:27:42 I'll have him around that I do not regret at all
00:27:45 Well then why'd you bring it out? We're talking about because I just wanted to talk about leopold
00:27:50 I guess it is regressed because this is a waste of money
00:27:52 Uh the the thing that I've wasted the most money is and the things that I regret the most are all the things that I've lost
00:27:58 Because I don't have them anymore
00:28:00 I've lost so many fucking things. I'm a clumsy adult and I don't know where any shit is
00:28:07 I just found my original ds the other day after like fucking like eight years of not having it
00:28:12 And it's like all like broken and shit and I love it, but I hadn't I and I don't have my fucking original 3ds
00:28:17 I think that one broke though. There's just so much shit. I don't have that. I just lost somehow
00:28:23 I don't know how I hate so much the the the like the fear of of an electronic device
00:28:30 Like like oh if I like a like a ds or a gameboy advance like if I bring it into the bathroom
00:28:35 What if I drop it in the toilet? It'll be ruined
00:28:38 I can I can I have to put it on my bed
00:28:40 And I and I have to walk, you know, and then I play my switch while I poop now every time and it is the greatest experience
00:28:47 It's too dangerous. It's so wonderful. I I'm never going back. My switch is my favorite thing in the world
00:28:51 It was worth every single cent every other console is garbage consoles are shit handhelds are the future
00:28:57 I mean, yes. Yes. Handhelds are far better than consoles. I hate consoles. I hate computers
00:29:03 I only like handheld gaming devices that that is
00:29:06 Do you remember okay? Do you remember what happened to your copy of like zelda for swords or something?
00:29:13 Yeah, what what you did with it, right? Well the tragedy that ensued. Yeah. Yeah. I know it was an accident
00:29:18 It was on some trip. It was on some trip like either to or from college
00:29:22 I was I was catching my train in in pen station in new york
00:29:26 And I the train was there it was like leaving and I was I had all my bags
00:29:30 And I was like running to jump on this train before the doors closed
00:29:34 And just as luck would fucking have it my fucking ds just bounced
00:29:39 Out of my bag and just like hit the ground and skidded and just fell off the edge of the platform
00:29:45 And just landed under the train and I was standing there looking down over the ledge through the gap
00:29:50 And I could see it there. Maybe like 10 feet away from me eight feet away from me
00:29:54 I was just sitting there and I just looked around like
00:29:57 well
00:29:59 I better get on the train
00:30:01 And then I got on the train and sat down. I was like my fucking ds with nate's game in it is like is like
00:30:07 Eight feet below me like down through the floor of this train. It is sitting there right now and I can't get it
00:30:12 Yeah, you know what though ben?
00:30:14 I I feel content knowing that the little mole people who man the trains who do the repairs at night
00:30:20 They creep out from the woodworks one of their little children probably obtained that ds and and enjoyed it to his heart's content
00:30:26 But no charger. It probably died in three hours
00:30:29 Well, it was the best three hours of that little mole's life
00:30:32 But but uh, but moles are blind so they wouldn't have been able to see it. Yeah
00:30:36 Oh, he could he could play through through psycho kinesis
00:30:39 Nate your story has more holes than hillary clinton's email story
00:30:44 Well, what about donald trump jr. He's done nothing wrong. He's he's oh, yeah, he's done nothing wrong
00:30:49 He's a good name one thing that trumps have done wrong. Hey, they have money. Can we talk about trumps money?
00:30:54 Uh, sure. What's there to say about tv show and the theme song was money money money money?
00:31:00 No, no, no, no, no, no that is that is trump wait that wasn't no, that's uh, uh, uh, that's that is vince mcman's son
00:31:07 That is his wwe song when he comes out. That's the song of the apprentice as well
00:31:12 Really? Oh, I guess they're repurposed it. Well, that's cool. Repurposed it
00:31:15 It's not like the song wasn't invented for wrestling. That's incorrect. It was invented for the song's been around forever
00:31:21 Is that true? Yes. Okay. All right. Jesse once told me like that's his theme song
00:31:25 And I know songs do get written for specific wrestlers
00:31:28 Well, probably I've been correct here. Maybe I've made a mistake. I don't think so. Okay, whatever
00:31:32 In any case, fine. Cool. Good. Was that the apprentice theme song? Was that the idea? Yeah? Yeah
00:31:36 Okay, I regret losing the most is my courage my pride and all of my wisdom
00:31:44 When he joined the piece, yeah
00:31:47 All of my wisdom
00:31:50 It's when you joined you you joined having all your wisdom
00:31:54 It is through the process of joining that you lost it all. Is that is that accurate? Okay. It's it's goodbye. Goodbye
00:32:02 Um, I may have told the story before but there was this one time when I was playing donkey kong country 2 on my
00:32:09 On my little brother's uh black gameboy advance sp
00:32:13 And I was I was getting frustrated because that game's really it's real hard
00:32:16 A real difficult game and I got mad and I threw it across the room because I didn't realize that things break
00:32:23 And it and it broke and that screen was fucked and I didn't know what to do
00:32:27 I just nobody heard it. Nobody was around
00:32:30 It was and it was like during like a like a the middle of the day. So
00:32:34 Uh, did you print out a screenshot from donkey kong and pasted over the screen?
00:32:38 Well, eventually that's what came of it. Like, uh, not not I didn't do that
00:32:42 But he he turned it into a memorial. He he he cut out a little a little uh image of like mario cart
00:32:49 Gba or whatever mario cut advance and he pasted that on and he just kept that as like a little little thing that you could flip it open
00:32:55 How did you make up for this great scene of yours?
00:32:58 This the thing was I I was so upset that well, I didn't I was I was scared really
00:33:05 Um, sure and my little brother was really upset and my dad came home
00:33:09 And he heard about it and he just left and then he came back with another one
00:33:12 But but he was my god
00:33:15 He came back with another one, but he looked at me so glaring like
00:33:19 I don't want to have to do this again
00:33:22 Hey, you know, I felt terrible
00:33:24 Pretty much he was a good dad
00:33:27 But I felt like a complete idiot, but it I didn't learn my lesson because a few years later
00:33:32 Oh
00:33:35 I broke that same brother's uh ds original by punching it
00:33:40 Because because because of dragon quest something or other
00:33:43 I was trying to do the casinos in a dragon quest game on ds and I punched the thing
00:33:47 I realized that if I punch it it might break, but I was so angry. I was willing to test it
00:33:51 And I
00:33:52 Test you really, you know, you really do have like a video game ball of rage inside. It does come out. Yep. I I'm I'm frucky
00:33:59 I'm evil. I'm terrible
00:34:02 When I was I was like eight and I would literally with my my gameboy advance when I lose against the pokemon league
00:34:08 I would just throw the thing as hard as I could across the room and the batteries would go flying out like fucking grenades
00:34:13 Right. No, but it never
00:34:16 That gba still works to this day
00:34:19 Damn, they don't build them like they used to no that uh, that thing's a fucking tank
00:34:23 What the hell is it with white people and throwing controllers? I don't get it with white people with white
00:34:29 White people specific to other races not do that. I would assume they do. I don't know. I've never seen a black man
00:34:34 What about the spicy latin community? They gotta do that. I did I did I did punch uh
00:34:38 I did punch my laptop in the screen one time and just fucking
00:34:50 Here's the thing here's the thing I was in college and and my school gave everyone there a basically a free laptop
00:34:57 That like well, I mean we had to pay for it, but they were like, okay
00:35:02 Well, they issued me a laptop and like they would repair it if it ever got broke
00:35:06 So like one time when I was home vacation
00:35:08 I just like punched it in the screen and just like cracked it all just ruined it while it was on
00:35:13 It felt really badass, but then like for the rest of vacation. I had no I had no laptop
00:35:17 Which was a bummer but then I went back and I was like, oh, yeah, I just dropped something on it and they were like
00:35:22 All right fine
00:35:23 Why didn't you wait until the end of the vacation to do that?
00:35:25 Well, it was it was I was mad about yeah, it was the heat of the moment. It wasn't like I'm not gonna be mad later
00:35:31 It wasn't like a free. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I really want to punch my laptop screen
00:35:35 But I don't I don't know if I'll be mad enough later. So I better I better conserve it
00:35:41 Um, uh, yeah, Ben Ben's Ben's a an angry lash out of things man. Yeah
00:35:46 Yeah, I kicked a hole in the wall that one time
00:35:48 You know the basement one time I I kicked a hole in the wall
00:35:52 But I'm gonna defend myself on that because like me and the parents were like really on the outs at the time
00:35:58 And they'd been and they'd been fucking giving they'd been
00:36:01 Okay, they took me to a shrink and they made they got the shrink to prescribe me riddolin
00:36:06 so for like two weeks I was taking riddolin and
00:36:09 Here's the thing I don't know whether the riddolin like made me fucking hyperactive and that's where this happened or
00:36:16 If taking the riddolin gave me an excuse to be hyperactive because now I could blame it on the riddolin
00:36:22 I don't know which is these is true
00:36:23 But yeah during that time I did like punch a hole in our basement wall
00:36:27 And then my dad our dad got so fucking mad and he made me repair it myself
00:36:31 Like I had to go to the the store and like buy putt like like plaster putty wall putty mix it
00:36:37 Like scrape it on like repaper the wall. It was like he
00:36:40 It took I mean it probably could have been done in a day by a competent craftsman or a couple days
00:36:45 But it took me like a fucking week to do it was miserable and
00:36:50 I was very sad
00:36:51 I think that's a fitting punishment. I think so too. Yeah, I think I think that's fair
00:36:55 But still it made me it really it really was a drag
00:36:59 Fair but I was gonna say it sounds like me and munchie. I've like never done shit like that ever
00:37:03 You know, I'm not a violent guy. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe it's just a thin boy thing
00:37:09 Maybe
00:37:10 Are you calling me fat you piece of shit?
00:37:12 No, I will you don't want to be fit. No, no, right
00:37:16 No, I don't know what it what it's caused by it, but I'm just an angry rage machine because I remember another story
00:37:21 Oh, my god, he's dead. We killed him
00:37:25 The original playstation one
00:37:28 Say or something and I and I I lost real bad and I have never heard
00:37:33 I never even like I'm so seething all my electronics. I have never like I don't I don't play video games with my sound
00:37:40 I went there and they'll they'll like hurt my ears. I oh fuck's sake. Why is it? Okay? Yeah, we hear you now. I can hear you
00:37:48 I'm so I'm so full of rage thinking about give rage. Yeah
00:37:53 That trademark Gibbon Ray
00:37:57 so so guys uh
00:38:00 I'm playing rayman one on ps1 the original playstation disc
00:38:04 I don't have it anymore because I got so mad that I took it out
00:38:08 Slowly and I just had it in my hands and my hands were shaking and you know when you're angry
00:38:13 And you need you feel the need to like really really clench your fists or pull on something real bad
00:38:18 And I had this disc on both hands and I was like
00:38:20 I wonder if I could just twist it just a little bit just a little bit twist it in my hands
00:38:24 And then I snapped it instantly. I was like
00:38:27 And you know my my hands were shaking. I was like
00:38:30 No, you know
00:38:35 I killed rayman's essence
00:38:38 It was the first time I destroyed a video game. I felt like my first time but far from the last
00:38:44 He felt that surge of power and knew he would do this every day
00:38:48 I was real sad, but I was very scared that people would find out so I shoved I slid it underneath the tv
00:38:54 And and I don't know who found it. I've probably somebody found it at some point
00:38:58 But uh, my brother's one says one day was saying where's rayman?
00:39:02 Where is it? Hey, that panic started to rise. Hey hippo. Hey hippo. Where's rayman? Where's rayman hippo? It's like
00:39:10 I didn't do nothing. He went out a good man
00:39:13 He took a trip far away to visit distant relatives. He's not coming back. Uh, don't look for him
00:39:18 There's the sequel rayman 2 the distraction
00:39:22 Oh, that's that's cute. That's hey, but remember that time we had a babysitter and we played frisbee with the final fantasy eight discs
00:39:28 Uh, what a fucking idiot. Yeah, I do. I can't possibly imagine wait. What what?
00:39:35 I was just like
00:39:37 We were just playing final fantasy eight having a great time and he was like, hey, here's a great idea
00:39:42 Let's play frisbee with the goddamn disc and we were like little kids. We're like, yeah
00:39:46 The babysitter suggested it
00:39:49 Yeah, he was the one doing it. Oh
00:39:52 Am I the kind of guy who's gonna play frisbee with his final fantasy eight disc? Absolutely not. He instigated
00:39:56 He instigated this madness. I remember and uh, I do remember that a guy a guy in our boy scout troop
00:40:02 He sold me legend of dragoon, but like the third disc was just broken
00:40:06 I remember that it was like a big fucking deal
00:40:08 And I think I had to get my parents our parents to talk to his parents and be like your son sold my son a broken thing
00:40:14 And like he've like reluctantly paid me back at some point
00:40:18 That sounds familiar that sounds and I remember once that was like my favorite game
00:40:21 But the third disc was broken and I couldn't get past that. Yeah
00:40:24 Yeah, one and then you for my birthday years later got me a new copy of legend dragoon
00:40:30 And it was the most wonderful. I was finally able to be I did what a cool guy. I am you used money
00:40:35 Yeah, I was just gonna say
00:40:38 And you know how I did that with money. So there you go
00:40:41 I have a new god. I have a new question if we want to talk more about money
00:40:45 Yes, we do. Please. It feels like a video game cast so far with all this webcam shit
00:40:50 It's fine. When we mentioned spoonie this question popped into my mind. Are there any people who make more money than you think they deserve?
00:40:58 Oh my god, I mean
00:41:03 All of us I think fall into that category
00:41:07 Ben in the last episode you said that the market gets to chew
00:41:09 So if anything that's making money at all like it deserves to because people are willing to pay for it
00:41:14 Well, yeah, all right. I have to engage in a little bit of double think here
00:41:18 Like yeah, I know that like people people can give will give money to what they value and I think that's fun
00:41:23 But like for me personally, I think like even though I like for example, gym sterling
00:41:28 Like I like him
00:41:29 But I think it is out fucking rages that he makes like $10,000 a month for what he does like that's like that's disgusting
00:41:37 But if people are willing to pay for it, what's the problem? But what are they paying for?
00:41:42 What are they paying for like the people just value his opinion that you know, you know what it is
00:41:47 You know what it is? It's not it's not people don't actually
00:41:50 Think that they're doing him any good because they're not like he doesn't need more money to do what he does
00:41:55 Like like he's passed the point where he he could whatever
00:41:58 They're just people just pay for for things like that people pay for for creators
00:42:03 Just because they want to feel something like they have something to do
00:42:06 They just want to hitch their wagon to theirs and like feel like they're a part of something which is like that's fine
00:42:11 I get that and I won't say that anyone's wrong to do that
00:42:13 But like it's annoying because like
00:42:17 Some people like oh you mean like me for example
00:42:20 Like I need money so that I can actually do the things I want to do and then someone like jim sterling
00:42:25 You're just giving him money to give him money at that point, you know
00:42:27 Yeah, I that that's definitely frustrating a frustrating feeling
00:42:30 Uh, but like on the uh, just this isn't really a counter example
00:42:33 But then you got people who just like that what they do is they game the stock market and produce nothing
00:42:39 And like they just make tons of money and even even look more like
00:42:42 Yeah, I guess you're right. There's worse injustices in this world. Yeah, I don't really know what my point is
00:42:48 I guess I just like I'm just escalating the scale of like this shit gets fucked up
00:42:52 I was just hoping we have high levels point out people on patreon and make fun of them
00:42:56 I don't want to talk about stock market. Hey, you know that you know that you know that porn lady who makes like the high-def
00:43:01 Still images of porn and makes like 30 grand a month. You know her. Yeah. No, I'm very interested
00:43:07 S-s-s-s-s-such
00:43:10 No, she's Saki Chen Saki. Yeah. Yeah. She draws like really like beautiful shiny like fucking fan art bullsh**
00:43:19 I like like
00:43:22 Like like ben I don't begrudge these people for earning their money
00:43:25 But considering like I'm trying to personally get to a level just to survive
00:43:30 On doing this stuff, of course, it's just naturally frustrating that I see these people making so much more than they actually need
00:43:37 Like it is you know, that's all but I don't begrudge them, but I just
00:43:40 I hit some of that I only begrudge people when they're in the same sort of line of work
00:43:47 Anyone a patron I consider especially like a creator like cuz like if it like is say that there's like a load of there's a big
00:43:54 I mean everyone knows there's a huge market for porn people
00:43:57 Yeah, like if you do porn you're going to get money and you're going to get like a lot more than you would doing something else
00:44:07 I can get upset at that. I mean generally generally like it generally the opportunity is certainly there
00:44:13 Yeah, well the point is if a video game reviewer of you know is
00:44:19 Making loads more money than me, and I think I'm better than them
00:44:23 Like it's not a game reviewer. It's it's it's it's it's more I feel
00:44:28 It's just a more relevant
00:44:31 Direction to put rage rather than just at people making money in general
00:44:36 Yeah, I mean, it's more frustrating when someone yeah, yeah when like when it feels like someone else is getting more for the same thing than you are
00:44:44 Yeah, okay, that's fair. That's fair like I don't know like peanut butter gamer for the fact that he survives at all
00:44:50 Well, Spoonie dude his money is gone. He is I don't know
00:44:53 He's making more than most of us. Yeah, not I've checked now making more than him now
00:44:58 And I mean obviously I deserve it. How much he makes nothing. How much is he making like $800, right?
00:45:04 Yeah, I think something yeah, that's about right, but like he's made nothing for months and you know
00:45:09 Like he's got his depression or whatever
00:45:10 But the point is he is not giving his patrons anything of value so why on earth would he get any money for it?
00:45:16 He shouldn't he shouldn't get any money. No, you know, but like that
00:45:20 You know these on to these people into thinking if they gave him a certain amount
00:45:23 He would make a movie that he has no intention of actually making I think he's a fucking scam con artist who deserves to give all his money
00:45:30 He's just said some stupid like like he's not he doesn't deserve to have like
00:45:37 He doesn't deserve to be able to say I'm going to do something because it's just not reliable
00:45:42 Well, he doesn't say anything anymore. I think he streams occasionally, but I don't even know whether he does that anymore
00:45:48 But I guess I don't follow that. Should patreon goals
00:45:51 We consider like a legal contract that these people gave you this much money for this thing that you didn't do
00:45:57 It's like a line
00:45:59 It is a line. I really hate that I would just get away with like
00:46:02 I like this moment to reiterate that I have not forgotten about the reward art that I owe people
00:46:07 If any of you out there are like really jonesing for that and like want it in a timely fashion like feel free to tell me
00:46:14 But for the but anyway
00:46:17 My guilt
00:46:19 How's the name different from a Kickstarter campaign that reaches the goal and then they just run off with the money
00:46:24 You mean like you mean like leaving the weave
00:46:31 It's in the works
00:46:34 Yeah, it's coming. It's coming. Don't let Jess listen to this episode. No, but it is that it is actually coming though. I promise
00:46:42 Stuff like that is that like the free market or whatever if people are
00:46:46 You there's nothing free market about lying and stealing
00:46:50 Yeah, but if you're known as a liar and stealer people aren't gonna pay money for you anymore
00:46:54 Well, they didn't know until you already stole their money. Yeah, I know but that's why I said you can get away with it
00:46:59 Once but after that you're fucked forever. So I don't know why you should be allowed to get away with it
00:47:03 I mean, you know the loud to it's just the way it is
00:47:06 Didn't she actually finish or is like is finishing me like three episodes once you promised to do like a million, right?
00:47:11 And when she did it was like three years late
00:47:13 Then once she said she would do and now she's like hosting panels and getting atheists kicked out of panels
00:47:19 And she's fucking retarded and people don't trust and love this woman who who conned them gay
00:47:25 Anita is the avatar of feminism and to oppose Anita just like to people to oppose her like
00:47:32 She is just she's just obtained this crown. Well, Hillary did nothing wrong and is perfect
00:47:36 But yeah, you know, it's just like for some reason she has this status now where you cannot oppose her without just being
00:47:43 Considered, you know, like a anti-woman or whatever. Yeah, which is you know, whatever
00:47:47 I
00:47:48 Know everyone's already said this but I want to reiterate the people who I think deserve no money are as follows
00:47:54 porn artists porn actors. Yeah
00:47:59 What's the weather? Oh, I completely agree with you much. You want a condom companies condom companies contrast
00:48:05 Yeah, any sort of
00:48:07 What is it a planned parenthood?
00:48:09 Yeah, I really agree. I really agree about I want to defund parenthood
00:48:19 I really agree about the porn actors and actresses because they're they're they're having sex, right?
00:48:30 No, they don't
00:48:39 Anybody ever see that gift of the dude snapping his dick
00:48:45 Yeah
00:48:49 What do you think it means
00:48:55 Yeah, that's right, that's what happens. It's fucking brutal
00:49:00 But it's like
00:49:03 Didn't break it just probably hurt. I mean, I don't maybe get like there's no like
00:49:08 What material is your dick made of like it's made of dick
00:49:12 It's made of a sponge. It's made of a spongy mucus membrane
00:49:17 Coiled up into a kind of foam
00:49:19 Muscle in there, too, so I think maybe it's counselor my dick's nothing but muscle, dude
00:49:27 I do my kegels every day do my cock push-ups. Oh wait, what's that thing? I do my jelking every fucking
00:49:33 Yeah
00:49:36 You joke but after jelking for a full year my dick is now one centimeter longer. Okay, so that's laughing now. It's not fucking true
00:49:49 All right, all right, you know, I'd love I'd love to I'd love to share my jelking story
00:49:53 But it'll have to it'll have to wait for another day because I gotta go I gotta go stream twitch.tv
00:49:58 Stream jelking
00:50:03 Yeah, viewers you'll you'll miss this one today, but we'll do more so go sub me
00:50:11 We might yeah, we might actually uh put them put them there, and they'll be up on twitch
00:50:19 I want to come on after this after this i'm gonna come on save me. Okay. I'll see you soon. I love you. I love you all
00:50:25 I love you, Ben
00:50:27 Is he gone? Is he gone yet? No, no, what penalty shall we give ben for leaving girl? He's still hearing and it's away from delay
00:50:33 Oh, i'm still hearing. What is this? What is it? What is this shit?
00:50:36 I just want before I go. Okay before I go
00:50:38 I just want to say that Nate if you want to fucking penalize me
00:50:42 Let me this is entirely your fault. It was your it was not. It was your fault
00:50:46 I said I have to leave before seven and then you had had technical issues that caused it to run late
00:50:52 All right, so me leaving is due to your technical issues. Okay, I would argue that I don't bear more responsibility
00:50:58 But I do bear the you know the the physical. Okay. It was okay fine. I can I can we can agree on that. All right, okay
00:51:04 Bye-bye. Yeah, okay. All right, seriously though. He's getting docked pay. He's not paying this boy for this
00:51:10 Can we just have a serious discussion about what we're gonna do about kicking ben out of the pcp?
00:51:15 I think now's the right time. That's the right time. Listen guys. I've been sick of Ben shit for a long time. Yeah
00:51:20 I've been sick of Ben for a while guys. He doesn't offer into the podcast. He's got nothing interesting to say
00:51:26 He's got no comedic timing. He's a big. He's a big gay, you know
00:51:29 When he edits the episodes, I have to write the description for him because he never does
00:51:33 Oh, do you do that too? Do you do that too? I sure do all the unfunny ones are from me
00:51:38 I I think that the pcp can be shaved down to like maybe one person if I really stretch it
00:51:43 Yeah, let's just make it. Let's just make it the the tom Oliver show. Which person would it be? That's a good idea
00:51:47 That's a good idea. Um, you're gonna have to find it. It has to be Jeff
00:51:54 Only Jeff has the vision to carry some of the 21st century. Tom has all the attributes of a true pcp member
00:52:00 Depression suicidal thoughts my little pony addiction. What else could you want?
00:52:05 It's pretty good. Yeah addiction
00:52:08 um, okay
00:52:11 Anyway, do you have any other points about money or should we just go to the question?
00:52:14 I have money right now. I'm gonna buy a pizza hut after this
00:52:18 I'm gonna buy a whole pizza hut restaurant Nate speaking of money. Go pledge your parents' hard-earned money to the pcp patreon

00:53:02 And monkey just had a bunch of questions for our failed pcp episode
00:53:05 We just tried to record but they were going to be involved. So if you want to be on the show, it's another way to do it, you know

00:53:29 This is a tangible benefit here. Do we have like like shirts yet?
00:53:34 The shirts are coming in fact

00:54:51 Of course, I forgot I've already I got it back before the episode even aired. So I'm gonna I was I was wondering
00:54:57 It's weird one week. I'm bragging about my subs and when it comes out my channel's gone
00:55:01 Next week. I'm complaining that it was deleted, but it's already back by the time it airs
00:55:06 We need to stop recording these eight days early. It makes us seem like we're crazy
00:55:10 That's the only way ben has enough time to edit them
00:55:14 Uh, okay, let's let's go to the questions. Here we go. Uh, I'm just gonna acknowledge as a block
00:55:19 Everyone's asking these questions about what is or isn't gay. Uh, well, let's just let's do an episode about that shit
00:55:24 You know, let's just do a bonus episode about that. I think we're gonna do a bonus episode about what's guys
00:55:29 By far the most popular questions we get every single week are about like is it gay to suck your own dick our traps gay
00:55:35 I think is the number one question
00:55:37 I've deliberately avoided them because I don't give a shit
00:55:39 But you're finally gonna get your answer if you become a patron the bonus episode is about this stuff
00:55:44 So, uh, and also if you listen to the insufferable social media argument podcast
00:55:48 We already answered all those questions me and digi so nobody cares about nobody cares about that podcast
00:55:52 That's that's the shitty podcast
00:55:55 Yeah, that's that's like the arm retrieval of your channel
00:56:01 Oh, no, yeah, it's true. Uh, okay. Here we go. So so so everybody a patron that'll be out

00:56:42 What about sonic himself? He's pretty hot
00:56:45 Sonic's pretty hot
00:56:47 He doesn't have enough
00:56:49 He eats. Oh no, wait, sonichu, of course. So I roast you. Oh, yeah
00:56:53 Roast you probably the whole pantheon is available to us a rose bubbles chew angel chew or whatever name is angelica
00:57:00 That's an angelica rose a chew. I don't know the hottest is because I hate sex
00:57:03 But whoever has the eye who has the most justice and valor
00:57:07 pulsing through his veins is vex the alligator
00:57:12 What about that little bumblebee? I like that little bumblebee that guy's a fucking faggot. He's a beat. I hate you
00:57:17 They're worthless
00:57:19 He's a punk ass bitch. You know what drop his fucking lights out
00:57:23 I like I like the the robot specifically from sonic heroes that that was that is that male sonichu
00:57:28 It's no no. It's the robot that was with shadow and rouge or something. Oh that guy from from adventure battle 2 or whatever
00:57:36 Yeah, that guy was cool. All right. Forget this shit. This is a gay question. Uh, how about uh, here we go
00:57:41 At a die nile 2 2 7 asks if you could restart life from birth while retaining all the memories and yes
00:57:48 You have now. Yes, would you no changing made no no changing major events?
00:57:53 What a shitty question what that ruins the whole question
00:57:56 Why why would you do it if you can't I want to be the baby who predicted 9 11 and called
00:58:00 George bush on the phone the morning of and said
00:58:03 Mr. President sir, mr. President sir, they're about to attack the twin towers and then he just replies
00:58:07 I know
00:58:09 Oh my god. Okay, but you know what I've had a fiction. I've had a thought about this for years
00:58:14 Okay, does everybody remember that remember the movie jumanji the old one not the new one with the rocking shit
00:58:18 Yeah, yeah, so so at the end of jumanji after they finally win after like it's like 40 years later something after they
00:58:24 You know robin williams grew up and that other lady grew up
00:58:27 So after that thing happened so so robin william spent that whole time since he was a kid in the deepest darkest jungle in jumanji
00:58:34 And he survived and you know he did this whole thing
00:58:36 So like he didn't really learn anything about real life, but he did become a real boy
00:58:39 Like he's he's you know a big fighty action jungle man
00:58:41 So that's cool
00:58:42 But that other lady like the lady that was his like childhood friend who grew up and they they finished the game together like
00:58:49 That lady lived to be like
00:58:51 35 or 45 or whatever like a middle-aged woman
00:58:55 Having gone through society seeing everything that happened in the real world
00:58:59 She knows everything and we saw at the end of jumanji when like that year those times just passes normally
00:59:05 When they meet those kids again like they remember everything that happened
00:59:09 So this woman knows every major thing that happened
00:59:13 Uh during the time between like the 70s and like 2000 or whatever jumanji came out
00:59:17 So like why is this woman not the richest person on the planet controlling everything major that happens because she understands
00:59:22 And can predict every single event that happened. Why didn't that happen because that's back to the future
00:59:29 Is a different movie. Yeah, I'm just uh, she she should have been the god
00:59:34 Busted that's the future of shit like that
00:59:37 Speaking of shit like that, you remember you ever know the the
00:59:41 Lion witch in the wardrobe where the kids they you know, they the i'm talking about the original movie
00:59:46 I don't know whether the the other movie has this but
00:59:49 The they they'd live in that world for fucking years and they grow old and they're like, you know late 30s or something kings and lords ladies
00:59:58 And then they go back and they find the wardrobe again
01:00:00 They come back through and their kids again in world war two. Yeah, and i'm thinking
01:00:05 They know what sex is and now they're little children. What's gonna go? What's gonna happen?
01:00:10 There's gonna be child pornographers, of course. Oh, yeah
01:00:14 The only good porn actor
01:00:18 In inception leo de caprio and his wife lived in the limbo area of the dream world for like 80 fully years
01:00:25 So technically he's been alive for like a fuck 130 years. It's crazy
01:00:29 Sort of but yeah, it's sure. That's that's pretty goofy shit. But what what uh, what was the question?
01:00:36 Uh, I can't remember why is jumanji the greatest movie. Okay. Now. Let's move on to the next question
01:00:41 Well, because i'm a level seven christ consciousness member
01:00:44 I've actually been alive for 6 000 years and I've watched humans evolve over time
01:00:48 And I just have to say that it's uh pretty good and I knew
01:00:51 It's gonna happen by just wanting it to happen. I didn't want to
01:00:54 Okay, good question. You wanted the holocaust to happen. Yeah, I mean, I don't know. It's pretty funny. Don't you?
01:01:02 I find that I find that interesting don't you think millions of people die even lose those sea belts
01:01:06 That's pretty interesting. All right. Go ahead. How I got a question. What are all right? Would you rather?
01:01:12 um live for a hundred years or
01:01:15 live
01:01:16 100 million thousand years, but it's the same year over and over again
01:01:21 Oh, definitely that definitely that one for sure that one for sure because I can speed run that shit
01:01:26 Yeah, plus there are billions of people like you'll never get bored because you can always find like a new person to
01:01:31 Fuck or you know mess with or you know, there's tons of stuff you can do even living the same
01:01:36 I might freak out and lose my sanity at some point, but I'm willing to gamble that I'm willing to take a chance
01:01:40 Don't you think after like 30 years you'd run out of art to consume? There's no new art being created
01:01:46 What's the well you can just work on creating it yourself like you can evolve yourself and I'm not entertained by watching
01:01:51 my own art
01:01:52 No, but you can watch people react to your increasingly good art as you learn new shit
01:01:56 You just want to read youtube comments for a hundred million years
01:01:58 It doesn't have to be youtube you could become a fucking sculptor you can change the world you become an economic genius and uh, you know
01:02:03 You gotta do it in within one year
01:02:05 So that's not even that long
01:02:07 But you can spend like those millions and billions of years over and over learning new things that will allow you to speed run that
01:02:13 Shit, yeah, but I think I would just get bored like showing things up like I want to watch the next avengers movie
01:02:17 And I couldn't do that the thing is though. Yeah, you might get bored just with people's reaction because like, you know
01:02:23 You know what they're gonna do, but I don't know I'd give it a shot
01:02:25 I'd give it a shot
01:02:27 What happens if you die in this theoretical hypothetical thing do you just come do you start the year over?
01:02:33 you
01:02:35 No, because then that would be a way to cheat if you just want to get through them
01:02:38 Yeah, I can practice every suicide method and see which one's the best I could perfect it sounds fine
01:02:42 So how about how about oh, how about if you kill yourself for the rest of the year?
01:02:47 You're uh, you're conscious you can feel like yourself decomposing and then when you get to the end of the year you just reset
01:02:54 So you're still like conscious for the whole year. That's fine. All I want to do was just assassinate the president over and over again
01:03:01 So I would find the best way to assassinate the president
01:03:03 Dude, don't talk about hillary that way. It's it's a sin to talk about hillary that way. You can't do his name with was seth rich god damn it

01:03:46 Yeah, but um, there wasn't really like a any big deal
01:03:49 It was just sort of he doesn't talk he didn't talk in the chat and he were like, uh, you're not really a member of us
01:03:55 Of our stupid gay group

01:06:04 That's really is you don't have to read this just for this hero character. You should check him out. He's pretty great

01:06:14 He literally
01:06:16 He shoots up his entire race. He destroys his entire fucking race because some girl won't go out with them

01:06:32 Bugs good bad or important by jade morrow. We bugs are great
01:06:37 Didn't we answer that last time jane? I would expect better from you. I'm deeply disappointed with his shitty quest
01:06:41 Maybe he's looking at a question from last week that might not have been released yet
01:06:45 Uh, so in that case, I apologize jade. That's true. Are you fucking bully?
01:06:49 Still die. No, no, she she can live. I love jade. She's great. Uh, let's uh, what else we got here. Uh, no, that's terrible
01:06:56 These are all bad. These are one more good one and go to bed because I've been here for three hours
01:07:01 Yeah, that's true. Um, okay, here we go. Uh, oh, it's another one from at porous saline god
01:07:06 So here's a chance to redeem yourself. What's the worst porn you ever accidentally saw?
01:07:11 Oh
01:07:14 That that would be the first one I ever saw which okay, I was I was google imaging search
01:07:18 I'm not fucking joking when I say this funny simpsons images
01:07:24 I googled that
01:07:26 And and I was just scrolling through like like I got to page like fucking 60
01:07:30 I just could not get enough of the funny simpson images
01:07:34 And eventually I came across this was the first porn I ever saw and I felt so bad when I saw it
01:07:39 A cuck it was a cuck image of bart fucking lisa and millhouse crying in the background
01:07:46 Wow
01:07:47 That's great. I'm the one who drew that. I can't believe you found it
01:07:53 I know
01:07:54 It was it was sublime. Oh god all of that that's simpson's stuff
01:07:58 It it's like one guy who does it like I don't know
01:08:02 I don't know whose mom key jones
01:08:06 I've seen that as well. I think that's probably the same like it's just so bad
01:08:11 It's all right. So and after I saw for the first time I literally cried because I was like I saw sex
01:08:15 I know what sex is now. I'm not a kid. I'm not a child last week
01:08:20 He had no this was actually in the future. It hasn't happened
01:08:25 The worst porn I've ever found was also the best porn I've ever found and that was the the legendary pain olympics of of yesterday
01:08:32 I was gonna bring that up god damn it. All right, you there you go. So nominal stuff
01:08:36 It was the back in the old days on spank wire dot com
01:08:39 There is a video known just as you know the spank wire video
01:08:42 It was named after the website
01:08:44 But it's really just a compilation of the best of the pain olympics and it had some good shit in it
01:08:50 A lot of which was inspiration for things that I detail in the triflers
01:08:56 A word yep. Yep
01:08:58 Uh, this isn't actually bad at all
01:09:00 But the only thing I can think of it was kind of bad just by sheer volume
01:09:04 There was this website that was shortly for a very very short lived amount of time was free
01:09:08 I think it still exists. It was called pink tube called pink tube and basically what it was was it was amazing
01:09:14 It was a wall of porn and it would scroll past you and like there would be previews of every single one playing at the same time
01:09:20 And all you would have to do is either highlight one with your mouse or click on it
01:09:24 And it would blow it up and make it big and like you could watch that and then as soon as you were bored
01:09:27 You could close that and it would keep on going and there'd just be infinite numbers of them. It was amazing
01:09:32 Uh, but they were all great. It wasn't bad at all. So that's not relevant. I got nothing
01:09:37 Um, I love funny census images
01:09:41 Give do you have anything to to to top this off?
01:09:46 I don't know about accidental porn
01:09:49 I bet you see some freaking brisks. There's no that's always deliberate. What are you talking about? Yeah fair fair point
01:09:56 But um, I guess there's a couple times where I was just on google
01:10:01 And I clicked on an image. It was like
01:10:03 Before like google could could block stuff like this and it redirected to a page of
01:10:09 Of like, uh, old people having sex and blowing each other
01:10:14 Uh, like old gay guys. I'm like, oh
01:10:16 And it was like enjoy your porn asshole and I wasn't even clicking on porn. It was just like an image of like not even anything
01:10:24 And it just redirected me to gay old man sex and talking lemon party
01:10:28 Lemon party, of course
01:10:30 It wasn't quite that because I also saw that and I'm like good god damn it. Why are the people keep putting this on the internet?
01:10:38 Lemon party's cute. I think those old men are adorable. Yeah, they're just having fun
01:10:42 Uh, I didn't like it because I'm not old
01:10:45 Yeah, yeah, but everybody should check out the offended page on encyclopedia. Dramatica that has some good stuff, too
01:10:53 Sick, uh, can I just shout out just this is this isn't even a room we need to go into but at nyankwan
01:10:59 Ask the question, uh glass is hot or not?
01:11:02 And I just like that it's a it's a picture of a girl with glass
01:11:05 So like I think we know she's got a bit of a dog in this fight. I think
