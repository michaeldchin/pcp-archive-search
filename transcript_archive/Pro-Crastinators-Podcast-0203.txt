00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome back to a new post Radcon 4 episode of The Pro Crastinators
00:00:11 Podcast. I am the best guy ever. Oh by the way this episode, 203 love numbers. I'm the
00:00:18 best guy ever we got Gibbontake over here. Oh my god, Radcon 4. It feels like it didn't
00:00:24 take any time at all and basically it didn't even happen. It was so quick. I'm just the
00:00:29 video. Nothing has changed. I'm back in my seat. I'm just looking over and I have two
00:00:32 new pins. One of which is a Radcon 4 pin. How interesting. Tom Oliver is here. Don't you
00:00:37 love how we had that brief spike of interesting mix up content and now we're back to the same
00:00:42 four people who are always on the podcast. It's great. It's great that we're settled
00:00:46 back into our monotony of weekly output. We're back in all the wrong ways. Speaking of our
00:00:53 monotonous fourth individual, here's Ben St. everybody. Hey guys. Shit. Fuck you. I had
00:01:01 something I was going to say. No. Stop. We're not moving on until I remember what it was.
00:01:06 Oh. Radcon. We're really fast. What? Life comes at you pretty fast. No. No. No. Sorry.
00:01:19 We're going to take as long as we need. Something about how fast it went or going. You idiots.
00:01:25 You idiots said things about Radcon that were sort of related to what I was going to say.
00:01:29 I said that Radcon felt like it was going real fast and it's like basically nothing happened
00:01:34 at all. Is that what it? True. Oh, I was going to say because it was going to make the brilliant
00:01:40 observation that it's been like a really, it's actually been like three weeks since
00:01:43 we recorded a regular episode and it feels weird. Indeed. Yeah, because we didn't do
00:01:48 one last like two weeks ago and then the one before that was the one, the live one. Right.
00:01:55 Yeah. Weird. That's right. Weird and wacky. Well, we're glad to have you folks back and we've
00:02:00 got tales to tell and stories to divulge about Radcon, the content we made, the meetup, all
00:02:07 kinds of fun stuff. No, we don't. Yes, we do. We've got like, we've got stories. 7-Eleven.
00:02:14 7-Eleven was a cool thing. 7-Eleven. Radcon 4 sponsored by 7-Eleven. Radcon 4 was sponsored.
00:02:22 It was maintained by 7-Eleven. You know, I was really hoping we would see the return of world-famous
00:02:28 beloved character 9-Eleven and the Royal Rumble, but I hear he came down with that
00:02:32 coronavirus. Oh, yeah. Fucking 7-Eleven should have been in the Rumble. Coronavirus is hot
00:02:39 enough to melt steel beams. This is bullshit. Next time we got to bring back 9-Eleven and
00:02:45 his son, 7-Eleven, as a tag team duo. It's only two years younger. Hey, speaking of pins
00:02:52 that I mentioned before, I don't want to tell this tale. So we had the meetup and oh, you
00:02:58 know what? Oh, I want to say it, but something isn't out yet that needs to be out as a part.
00:03:01 Okay, I'll just tell you what I can tell you, which is that at Radcon 4, the meetup on
00:03:07 Pi Day, March 14th, it was a great time. We got images, show notes, look at all the people
00:03:12 who showed up. Oh, by the way, guys, I didn't show you yet, but Victor sent me the pictures
00:03:16 of the meetups and the OVA photo shoot calendar pics that they exist. So I'll get them to
00:03:24 you soon. Oh, and the big group shot of all of us at Radcon. Maybe I'll grab that shortly.
00:03:30 I was going to say about the meetup. It was a great time. People showed up. Not too many
00:03:33 people were spooked off by the virus, which was nice.
00:03:36 This was before. I'm sorry. I was going to say, it's funny. I feel like the coronavirus
00:03:44 thing went from spooky rumor to real shit pandemic while we were at Radcon. It's very
00:03:52 funny. Once we were there, we realized, oh, shit, things are getting real. Hippo, you
00:04:00 real possibility that you might not be allowed to fly home didn't end up happening.
00:04:05 I never felt like that was a possibility just because of why would they not let a foreign
00:04:11 person leave? That seems like anti-American. Well, the UK might have said no flights from
00:04:16 America or something. Maybe. I mean, I don't think... That's true. I guess I just wasn't
00:04:21 thinking that that was going to happen in the time frame. That had entered my thought,
00:04:25 but I was just like, even in the worst case scenario, Gible just stay with Digi for a while,
00:04:29 who lives right there and it'll all be fine and good. I'll do a bunch of weed and I'll be completely
00:04:33 destroyed as a man. That would have been so funny. Imagine how much weed you would inhale just
00:04:40 passing Digi on an average day at his home and his base. It would be nightmarish. But hey,
00:04:46 about the meetup, I just want to say that if you came, I'm sure you had a great time as we all
00:04:50 did. Part of the photo, go down the legacy. It was the first dedicated PCP meetup, I think,
00:04:56 not like a RFCK thing or any of that side stuff or a BronyCon one. This is for the PCP,
00:05:03 Radcon specifically. And you people, if you didn't come, boy, oh boy, did you miss out,
00:05:09 because at the brilliant suggestion of Tom Oliver, we're produced, and there will be links to this,
00:05:15 the wonderful PCP pennies, the crypto currency, decentralized crypto punk currency,
00:05:23 that we gave out in real life to all attendees for free. And we're on the streets, they're going
00:05:29 to the moon. It's such a powerful cryptocurrency that it only exists in physical space. You can
00:05:36 only have physical points. I've been looking at the stock markets. The economy is tanking,
00:05:44 Ripple is way down, but PC pennies are picking up the slack.
00:05:48 Remaining stagnant at value of one pin per pin. You're just not fluctuating at all.
00:05:53 To go to Gibb's point, it's not so much a cryptocurrency as it is a cryptid currency.
00:05:59 They apparently exist out there, but the sightings are very slim.
00:06:05 Please, click the link in the show, it's if you don't physically own one, you hack, who didn't
00:06:09 even come to Radcon meetup. Tom made the design, it's beautiful, it's real. I'm holding it in my
00:06:14 hands right now. It's next to my Radcon four pin, and we gave them weight for free to the people
00:06:19 who should have extras. Wait, before we move on, at the meetup, who was it? Who was it? I'm trying
00:06:25 to find the name of the guy. Ben Rodea. Ben Rodea came to the meetup and he had made a gigantic
00:06:33 punk plush. Of course. The life size punk plush that I have on my chair right now,
00:06:39 she's doing like a cool like sitting down, like what are you looking at? Sort of pose.
00:06:42 Legendary. Legendary weight. It was unveiled right at the end of the meetup too. None of us
00:06:48 saw it coming, and then all of a sudden there was punk, life size. Yeah, he just ran to his
00:06:52 hotel room and got his. So cool. Let me say, friggin Eric was there, Dune Koon was there,
00:06:59 endorsing slavery, like the hero he is. Friggin Eric. Friggin who made the ride shot. Friggin
00:07:04 Eric. Oh, oh, oh, right. The gunsmith. Gotcha. Gunman. And it was all kinds of kooky characters
00:07:11 that came to that place. It was great. It was such a wonderful experience. We were there for like
00:07:15 six hours walking around Virginia Beach. We hung out most of the day. Well, almost the evening,
00:07:21 I guess. And there will be, I'll make sure those images are left. Zen Uxtable came.
00:07:27 That's right. Zen was there for a day. He was involved in a little bit of RAD content,
00:07:30 which was cool. I won't say what, but it'll be out pretty, pretty darn soon.
00:07:35 There was, there was that, that Fern guy that I know, tangentially a little bit about from.
00:07:40 Oh yeah. But he wasn't there for RADCon. So fuck that guy.
00:07:42 I like, I like, while Zen was there, I was like, I was, I was asleep. I was like asleep the entire
00:07:50 time Zen was there. Well, I think because I had, oh, it's because I had stayed up the previous
00:07:56 night making my either, uh, I was doing, doing something for one. I think for the,
00:08:03 you, you were working on your board for the Christian lecture, while me and Jesse were
00:08:07 streaming. Right. Yeah. During the stream, I sat there trying to write shit on the board,
00:08:12 but like just getting distracted and not getting any work done. I did like 70% after the streaming
00:08:17 that entire week. Me, you and Jesse and Gib, we were all up all night, every night streaming
00:08:23 like badasses. It was sick. That's true. That's true. I was, um, actually the first couple nights
00:08:29 I was up for a long time every night, uh, in my bed reading one piece on my phone,
00:08:35 at which you ended up being a big waste of time because I didn't actually manage to quite, I'm
00:08:39 still like 30 chapters behind. So I didn't, I didn't catch up in time to get on the podcast,
00:08:45 but the, you still could any time. I probably will. Actually, I forgot about that. But yeah,
00:08:51 I'm like, I'm almost, I'm almost caught up now. Word. Yeah. Word. There's so, there's so much
00:08:57 things that were recorded. It feels like because of the, the, the whole thing with, there was like
00:09:02 six, seven, six or seven lectures. And to do the lectures, people, we didn't like perfectly
00:09:09 figure out exactly everything before we arrived. I think most of us had most of the general idea,
00:09:16 but like so much time was spent finishing off notes, writing stuff on the board, and then doing
00:09:22 the lectures, like so many hours of the, the 10 days. You, that's true. You all, not you,
00:09:27 hippo, but you all fuckers. Why are your lectures so fucking long? I can't talk. I don't want them
00:09:34 to be. I can't talk for tonight. I can't talk for a while. I just, I'm just, I'm just so talented
00:09:41 that I can get, I'm so succinct that I can't make a lecture more than two hours, even if I try.
00:09:47 I thought the Christian would be longer than that, but it wasn't. Yeah. It served you well.
00:09:53 But it, yeah, we spent a lot of, we spent a lot of the time just in these fucking
00:09:59 unbelievably long lectures. It was like, especially towards the end.
00:10:05 Uh, you know, I haven't done the math, but I, we like either tied or slightly more lectures at
00:10:11 Radcon four than like any of our previous radcons. I can't quite, I mean, whatever. I'll do the math
00:10:17 later, but, uh, how much math is it? You just got to count to seven. Well, I just don't remember
00:10:23 is the issue. I guess it's not a math question. It's a simple remembrance question of how many
00:10:29 fucking things happened, but it doesn't matter. Uh, nonetheless, it was epic and the classroom theme
00:10:35 was, uh, was good and fair and it pervaded lots of the stuff. When we were coming up with scripts for
00:10:41 various of our productions, we were able to incorporate the, uh, the school PCPU theme
00:10:46 very well. So that memes really got legs. It's really, uh, it's really going places.
00:10:50 Um, it's good stuff. Uh, Radcon four, what do you guys think guys? Let's, let's take a vote.
00:10:56 Radcon four, based or cringe? I, I would say based, but I wanted it to be longer.
00:11:02 By the time it was over, I was like, damn, is that it? Let's address that real quick. Cause
00:11:06 okay, at Radcon three, like Ben showed up halfway through. So like we couldn't do lectures until
00:11:11 that point. It's so strange to me to think that I was not even there for like, I was only there for
00:11:16 like a little over five days or so. I don't know, but like, and Radcon four felt way faster. It did.
00:11:24 It really did. I think, I think it really came that comes down to like the, the first few days
00:11:29 we were hardcore filming really, you know, the, the OVA was a big project. Um, the, the, the, uh,
00:11:36 the day out, the, the meetup was a whole like day out. So it was like, and basically everything
00:11:44 else was like really strenuous, like constant work. And I don't know. It was, it was, it did
00:11:51 feel like constant work. Yeah. We felt like we were, we were really busy the whole time.
00:11:55 Like time flies when you're in, uh, when you're doing work, I guess. Yeah. Because we crammed
00:12:03 so many, we did like three lectures in one day at Radcon three, if I remember correctly, because
00:12:08 we were hitting the wall and we had to do it at three. Yeah. I think so. I don't remember. Well,
00:12:13 maybe, maybe it wasn't, maybe, maybe it wasn't three lectures at least two, least two. Yeah.
00:12:18 We were going pretty early into the morning at Radcon three. Yeah. We went like all night.
00:12:23 Oh yeah. I think, I think in Radcon three it was like Tom's lecture followed by Nate's
00:12:27 Final Fantasy lecture was one of the days. Oh God, did we do both those the same day?
00:12:31 God, what a nightmare. Yeah. Yeah. We did two, we did two lectures, um, in a row this time too.
00:12:40 One of them was hippos and yours was reasonable. Hippos was mercifully shorted and it was already
00:12:46 out. Yeah. Go click the link. Uh, I, I don't think we need to release them that fast. I mean,
00:12:55 yeah, it's not super important. My, um, my Jennifer Diane writes lecture whose title I'm
00:13:01 still debating. I'm constantly going back and forth on what I want to title it, but, um,
00:13:06 it's almost ready. Just, uh, it's, it's basically all edited. I just have to like figure out some
00:13:11 like weird editing, or weird like rendering hiccups and that's basically ready to go. But like
00:13:17 the CWC one probably, I am probably not going to do that one for a little while. I will,
00:13:22 that's going to back burner that while I work on, um, finishing the slime and punishment finale.
00:13:26 Sure. Um, I don't know. I might just kind of, I don't know. The people want to hear that.
00:13:33 How many lectures, how many lectures can, are people going to watch in like,
00:13:36 are people going to watch a lecture every day? No. Uh, well that's fair. Maybe.
00:13:44 Some might, some might. I think given them like, uh, I don't know, two or three days,
00:13:48 like if like, I wasn't in control of releasing exactly what, I'd release one every maybe like
00:13:52 two days or something. I think that's enough time for the people who are the most interested to
00:13:56 consume and whatnot. God damn. The red con, I mean, we're, I, it was frustrating at the time,
00:14:04 but in hindsight, I feel like it was maybe a good thing that the content from rad con three
00:14:09 took so long to release and it was trickling out over the course of like a year plus.
00:14:15 That's not a terrible thing. It keeps people interested in, uh, the rad con cycle turning.
00:14:20 It took a full year for TBAP resurrection to come out and I don't really think it hurt anything
00:14:26 particularly. I don't think, I don't think so either. If anything, it kind of kept like interest
00:14:31 alive in, uh, rad con overall. Like imagine if they'd all come out in like, I don't know,
00:14:35 two weeks and then you had two dead years. Ten? Well, well, I mean, maybe if we had gotten the
00:14:42 content out faster, we would have thought about organizing rad con four sooner. Think about that.
00:14:49 That is true. That is true. I mean, I wasn't even thinking about it because I was so swamped with
00:14:56 the stuff we were still doing. So that's, that's fair. Yeah. Um, like this time probably we're
00:15:02 going to have like the OVA will probably take at least a few months, a couple months to come out
00:15:08 and the dojin will probably be after that. Probably. Or maybe they'll come out together. I don't know.
00:15:14 The music video, I don't think will take that long to get done, but we have some work to do
00:15:18 on it still. Yeah. The music video will be out less than a month probably, right? I would assume so.
00:15:25 Probably. If we get all the song release stuff arranged, which shouldn't be too complicated.
00:15:30 Yeah. Yeah. Taste. Hey guys, what did you think of my first lecture? My first foray into talking
00:15:37 in front of people. Dude, it was good. It was good. It was a good lecture. It was good. I would, I,
00:15:44 I mean, it was the first very small like focus, although it was more, it had more like lower
00:15:50 than I expected it to. It went a little longer than I expected, which wasn't a problem. It makes
00:15:54 sense. This is a new territory of small, very specific lectures that we need more of. This
00:16:01 could be the future of lectures as we're out of gigantic big series that we could talk about for
00:16:06 four hours. We're not out of those. We're not out of those. I think it's good. It's a good precedent
00:16:14 to set though, because there's, I think we all have a lot more of those kinds of lectures in us
00:16:19 than the big four hour ones. Yeah. I was always debating for so long, like before, like,
00:16:26 do I even know enough about a big thing that I can talk about a whole big thing in a lecture?
00:16:32 And I guess I forgot about one thing that I could do next time.
00:16:38 So that that's a secret tease for the next year. Yeah, I'm not trying to imply that there aren't
00:16:42 any. It's just get your wallets out for Radcon five boys. Gibbs already ready to go. I guess next
00:16:48 time I'll I'll do that. I'll do that. Oh, Lillia one. But I really doubt it'll be like long.
00:16:55 His it's actually pretty. It's actually pretty quick to explain what his books are about.
00:17:02 They're pretty. They're sort of they're sort of devoid of interesting facets.
00:17:10 Well, I mean, I am curious how successful like a half an hour lecture would be as an example.
00:17:16 You know, in the same style, probably probably I'm sure it would do fine. I'm sure it wouldn't
00:17:21 be a problem. Yeah. Yeah, certainly. Certainly. Yeah, I'm going to vote. Radcon four was cringe.
00:17:31 No. No. In what way? Sight your sources, explain your argument.
00:17:41 It was cringing that I had to wake up and do things. Oh, that's cringe.
00:17:46 Yeah. Thank you. No, it was really cringe about Radcon four, our diet the entire week. It was
00:17:52 that's terrible. Some might argue that's based. No, no, it was. I feel like I feel like it was
00:17:57 better than than Radcon three, because three was almost entirely cereal and then fast food.
00:18:04 Well, that's true. The first half of Radcon three's diet was cringe. This this time we had bacon and
00:18:10 eggs, which is sort of bacon. It was a staple for survival. There was more. There was more alcohol
00:18:18 at this one. The second half of Radcon three, Nate's and Ben's parents brought us over like
00:18:22 real food. So the second half of Radcon three, definitely bring like Turkey or mashed potatoes
00:18:28 or something. Yeah, yeah, stew or something. There was a lot of like just like real food.
00:18:33 Yeah, it was good. And to the point where we didn't use like half the groceries we bought
00:18:37 the beginning of the week. That's true. That was pretty much nobody drank any fucking beer.
00:18:43 I was like the only one that drank beer. I don't even like drink beer usually, but like we were
00:18:47 there at Radcon. We had a big case of beer. I was like, well, I feel like it's in the spirit of the
00:18:52 event to be drinking this all the time. I don't much prefer beer hard liquor in any capacity.
00:18:59 If I ever choose between a shot of vodka and a beer, I'll take a shot of vodka
00:19:04 every time. 100%. A beer is pleasant. We were on vacation. I don't know why everybody didn't
00:19:10 constantly have a beer in their hand. It would have been funny. Because you had them all, Ben.
00:19:15 I would have if it was like brought up more. I wouldn't have had them all if other people
00:19:22 had been drinking them. This is a chicken and egg situation. It is. It is. Like the whole tiki bar
00:19:27 aspect, I don't think I was there for like coming up with that for the Kickstarter. So I wasn't like
00:19:33 thinking of this as like, oh, the alcohol Radcon. So I never really thought to do it until it was
00:19:38 a stream time. Well, you know, the first night, I definitely got significantly drunk. That was
00:19:44 the best night. That was the best night. That was the best night. It was the best night until
00:19:49 after the stream where I literally threw up in my sleep and woke up covered in puke. It was. Oh,
00:19:55 God, did that happen? That did happen. Oh, that's awful. Yeah, it was fucked up. I mean, I puke,
00:20:00 but famously, I deliberately strategically puked during the stream and it worked like a charm and
00:20:07 it was the best decision I ever made. I should have done what you did. I've never been that drunk
00:20:11 in my life and I never will again. I've learned my lesson. Law. Law. I've been way drunker than
00:20:19 that many times. As have I. As have I. But I've made a, what's the word, a conscientious objector
00:20:25 stance? It's morally wrong and no one should do it. It's immoral. Terrible. Terrible. Anyway.
00:20:32 No fun allowed in Nate's life. No fun allowed. And fucking, I'm disappointed. We had to leave
00:20:38 all the extra alcohol with Digi. So now he's got like half a handle of gin, half a handle of vodka,
00:20:44 and half a thing of like. Amazingly, the people may know as we were transporting those out of the
00:20:49 house, we like lost all the lids. Yeah. So these like open containers. I had to sit in the back.
00:20:55 I had to sit in the back of Jesse's car with these open liquor bottles, which I think is illegal.
00:21:00 That's illegal. That's definitely illegal, but I did it anyway, because fuck the Polis. I mean,
00:21:05 it's not illegal for you. I think it's illegal for Jesse, since he was driving. Oh yeah, true.
00:21:10 But whatever. Even if like they breathalyzed you and you had no blood alcohol. It's still illegal,
00:21:15 because I mean, you might just be, could theoretically be sipping a little bit or something,
00:21:18 and it's just a discourage, you know. I don't see why it would be illegal. Okay. I don't see why
00:21:25 it should be illegal to drive with open containers if you are like demonstrably not drunk.
00:21:32 You know, there have been times this has amused me when like, I remember when I was in college or
00:21:37 something, and my dad would pick me up from the airport, and dad would greet me in the car,
00:21:42 and he would have like a beer for me, and generally not to shit on my dad, but also like one for
00:21:47 himself. Oh, don't say that. Oh, don't fucking tell me that. That sucks. That fucking sucks.
00:21:52 It was like one though. It wasn't really that bad or that serious. That fucking sucks. It just is
00:21:56 technically illegal. Sucks. Which, you know, is amusing. Uh, dab, ACAM. Oh, dad. I mean,
00:22:05 that's one of the cool dad things that dad does sometimes. No, it's not. What? I think drunker
00:22:10 is not going to make you. It's not cool dad behavior. Do you explain why? Why is driving drunk
00:22:17 not cool? I don't know, Nate. Is one beer going to get our dad drunk, Ben? Is that the point?
00:22:21 I guess not. I guess not. All right. You shouldn't fuck, whatever. I'm not encouraging it, but if
00:22:26 you want to be cool, I'm just, you know. Nate, your sense of cool is like fucked, and it sucks.
00:22:32 Okay. Well, luckily, everyone listens to me when I tell them what's cool and what's not.
00:22:39 Based, dad. Nate heads, consummate drunk drivers. What else is going on? Starts an epidemic
00:22:46 in the PCP audience. Nate has never drank except when driving. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
00:22:51 Dad's a better driver drunk than sober. He's actually more dangerous with without all boomers
00:22:56 are with it. I believe it's Joe Biden's main, main, you know, presidential criteria. Oh, yeah.
00:23:02 All those times that he like is confused and doesn't know what he's doing. Like that's when
00:23:06 he isn't drinking. They get him liquored up before like a debate. So he can like seem
00:23:11 coherent. It's very wise. Just long enough to ruin America. Yeah. Okay. What other highlights
00:23:16 we got here? What else went down? Let me look at my notes. Yeah, let's talk about the Animorphs
00:23:22 lecture. Now, okay. First of all, you released your Animorphs lecture. Everybody loved it. We
00:23:26 were there. It was great. Way better than I thought it was going to be. And first of all, on Twitter,
00:23:32 who was that I saw commenting on the fact that his creation had had this big lecture made about
00:23:38 it? Was it K.A. Applegate? It was not quite. It was her husband who co-wrote the books. He's
00:23:45 someone linked him the lecture and he saw it and liked it. What? Excuse me? Yeah. Yeah.
00:23:50 Fucking excuse me, sir. And just now that I just retweeted, Catherine Applegate herself
00:23:55 responded with a heart emoji to the reverse. You've got to be shitting me. No way. It's made
00:24:01 it all the way to the top. It's funny because I was looking. You've got to be shitting me,
00:24:05 dude. No, bro. It just happened. It's real. Fucking ridiculous. How did she find out about it?
00:24:11 You'll link that tweet, dog. Link that tweet in the links. Yeah, someone sent a message to
00:24:17 her husband saying, hey, here's a lecture. Oh, my God. And it just went up the chain,
00:24:22 which is fucking insane. Catherine Applegate at K.A.A. author. Holy shit. Yo, this is
00:24:32 definitely hashtag Applegate happening right now. It's busted. The gates of heaven wide open.
00:24:38 Did she like retweet your lecture, maybe? I don't think it retweeted. I think she was just
00:24:43 responding to my comments saying like, hey, I did this thing. It's fucking lit. Why wouldn't
00:24:49 she do that? I don't know. Why wouldn't she do that? Because she can't sanction all of Tom's
00:24:53 ooze. I think because Nate was a raging misogynist throughout the entire video,
00:24:59 which people are mad about. You were a bigger misogynist than I'll ever be, Tom. Well,
00:25:03 endorsed everything I said. I did. And you loved it. I do not disavow. In fact, I avow. I avow it
00:25:10 off. I don't love bass, Tom. That is, that's so cool though. It's Applegate. Applegate herself
00:25:19 saw the lecture. Well, it's so weird because I was looking, I was uploading it and I was like,
00:25:25 I need to think of a title for this. It's like, what have people been like,
00:25:29 titling things for animorphs on YouTube? There's nothing. There's like, literally nothing. Like,
00:25:34 the top results are the number one result when you search for animorphs is someone just made a
00:25:38 video of the entire Nickelodeon series. There's one big video that's like four hours long and then
00:25:44 didn't someone have like a animorph sucks. They had like 4000 views on some channel. I thought
00:25:48 somebody had, I mean, that's small. There's like the only big project with animorphs is some guy
00:25:53 over the course of like seven years did like long reviews on every single book, but they didn't
00:25:58 ever seem to hit animorphs. Animorphs is one of those like early, well, I don't remember what time
00:26:04 period is like late nineties, early 2000s sort of thing. It's well, it's one of those things that
00:26:09 came up and was its big heyday before the internet, before people could post like DeviantArt things.
00:26:15 That's true. That's true. It reminds me of like, like, like certain video games from that era
00:26:23 where like one or two pieces of fan art, but if they were posted nowadays, there'd be a million
00:26:27 videos, a million pieces of fan art. That's true. The times have changed. Press B in the chat if you
00:26:32 want the mythical Victor Beast Wars lecture one day. Oh God. Beast. Yes. I'm not ironically want
00:26:39 this so bad. Actually, yeah, not a bad idea. I like Beast Wars. I just, I searched on YouTube for
00:26:48 Jennifer Diane writes and nothing. There is not, there is not, there's nothing. There's no video
00:26:55 that like has that in the title. Damn. Yeah. When it comes to like interesting,
00:27:00 Kokoro Wish is probably a little more popular. When it comes to like interesting subject matter,
00:27:06 Vriska is not like that obscure. So I kind of like failed in that aspect, but you know,
00:27:12 I just don't know cool weird things that nobody knows about. No, there's nothing. You search
00:27:17 Kokoro Wish and there's a channel called Kokoro Wish that has 37 subscribers and that's it.
00:27:24 Okay. There's a music video called Eternal Kokoro Wish. It has 185 views and that's
00:27:30 literally it. Ben, what do you think is the likelihood of you making this lecture about
00:27:34 Jennifer Diane writes and then that spawning a, what do you call it, a gold rush of people
00:27:42 making like a lectures and analysis of, you know, down the rabbit hole with this person.
00:27:48 Yeah. Wait, who would be doing that? Just people, just YouTubers would be like, oh,
00:27:54 what's Jennifer Diane writes? Oh, this gets lots of views. I'll make a million videos about it.
00:27:58 Wait, wait, wait. Oh my God. Funny, Nate, get ready. One of like the six, like a dozen results
00:28:05 down. One of the videos that comes up is actually Legacy of the Pony, part two from T-Bat Plays
00:28:13 titled Big Boobs Bad Webcomic. And I guess- Oh no, that's heinous. In the description, I linked
00:28:22 to the Jenny verse because I guess we talked about it. You must have talked about it. Yeah, yeah.
00:28:26 God, T-Bat Plays was- Back to live T-Bat Plays, guys. T-Bat Plays was peak content. I swear to
00:28:31 God, like this was the point. You would, if you had watched T-Bat Plays, you would already,
00:28:36 you wouldn't need the lecture. You would already- That's true. Ben, remember the intense controversy,
00:28:41 the T-Bat, we were almost closed our doors. We almost shattered our windows at this event,
00:28:46 where because we did 10 minute episodes, I insisted that we stop filming an episode
00:28:50 in the middle of a boss fight during Equestria Bound and we'll be back next time. And by this,
00:28:55 I mean, maybe like two or three people commented saying like, that was fucked up.
00:28:59 I do not remember that, but I'm sure- I'll never forget that day. Sounds very on brand, yeah.
00:29:05 It had to be done. I mean, hey, since K. Applegate is fully endorsing Tom and all his political
00:29:11 beliefs, I can't wait for Diane Rice to do it for Ben and for Vriska to do it for Giv. Jennifer is
00:29:17 online. She is on FIM Fiction. She's actively writing and commenting and stuff on FIM Fiction.
00:29:23 She has a YouTube channel. It wouldn't surprise me at all if she-
00:29:27 Yeah.
00:29:27 If she called for the lecture and maybe saw it.
00:29:30 You should do a like T-Bap, so it's like Friendship is Magic related, T-Bap transcript
00:29:37 of like Phantom Horn saying your entire lecture as a fanfic. And then she can comment on that.
00:29:43 Wait. So it's on fanfiction.net?
00:29:47 Okay. No, the entire fanfic is just like starts like scene, a tropical house. Phantom Horn walks
00:29:56 out in front of a whiteboard. Quote. And then it's just the like the full transcript of the lecture.
00:30:01 And-
00:30:03 Do it. Perfect.
00:30:05 Why not? Why not? That's so- I'm- you think Andrew Hussie will see the Vriska lecture?
00:30:14 I mean-
00:30:15 No.
00:30:16 No.
00:30:17 It's Andrew Hussie. He doesn't give a shit.
00:30:19 I mean he might see it, but like nobody knows anything he sees because he never does anything
00:30:24 online anymore. Like if he liked it, he won't click like. He'll just sort of like smile.
00:30:30 With his nasty fat lips.
00:30:32 You know, maybe he does a fat lips. Maybe he wouldn't appreciate a fellow Vriska connoisseur
00:30:38 in this particular unique format that makes the kids go Goo Goo Gaga because they are babies.
00:30:43 Babies enjoy the lectures is my point. Maybe this is like a kind of format that he would
00:30:48 like more.
00:30:50 Maybe.
00:30:51 My thinking about my choice of lectures is like, I know the people crave- they've been crying out
00:30:57 for CWC 102, right? Part two. That's- that's me like giving- that's me giving like the people
00:31:05 what they asked for. That's me like being like, okay, here's what the people expect of me,
00:31:10 here's what they want. I'll give it to them. To Jennifer Dayan Wright's lecture is me
00:31:15 exercising my artistic power to give people what they do not yet know that they want.
00:31:23 Of course.
00:31:23 Of course.
00:31:24 The- the- I feel like this- I feel like that one is super cool and interesting and people
00:31:30 who watch it and listen to it will be like, wow, that sure is fucking neat and I never would have
00:31:35 known any- I wouldn't have ever heard- ever heard of any of this stuff if not for this.
00:31:39 Because that was largely our reaction upon listening to the lecture.
00:31:42 That's- yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I was watching- I've watched it back like so many times because
00:31:47 I've been going through and editing it. I've-
00:31:48 Right, right.
00:31:49 I'm sick of it.
00:31:52 Also, as a- as a treat, as a treat, I put in, um, okay, remember- remember in the lecture how I
00:31:59 mentioned that before she started making web comics, she made a thing called Kami Shibai,
00:32:02 which is like a little like interactive like-
00:32:04 Yep.
00:32:04 Like game. In- in the middle of the lecture, there's like a little 10-minute block in it
00:32:09 where I just play the Pastel Defender Heliotrope, um-
00:32:13 Sick.
00:32:14 Kami Shibai, uh, you know, from 1998, like six years before the comic started, uh, and it's-
00:32:21 it's actually kind of cool. It's got like- it's got like pretty hype anime chiptune music
00:32:26 that plays over it. Like, that's- that's like in the original thing. I don't know where she
00:32:31 got it from. I don't know who made it, but uh, it's- it's sick. And again, and that's like nowhere.
00:32:36 You can't see that anywhere unless you go and download the Kami Shibai and download the files
00:32:41 and play it in the thing, and nobody's gonna-
00:32:42 Was it hard to find?
00:32:43 Can do that. Yeah. Uh, I- I feel like it sort of feels like lost media, but I'm sort of recovering
00:32:51 a bit.
00:32:52 Good. Good.
00:32:53 Yeah.
00:32:54 That's kind of what I hope these things to be.
00:32:57 They're- I don't know, they're a little bit more than just a video. I mean, uh, you know,
00:33:01 a lot of it is like, uh, we were talking about, like, how long it takes to make notes. Like,
00:33:04 sure, it takes a couple hours to put together notes or whatever, but really it just takes,
00:33:07 like, a lifetime of dedication to, like, either a particular media or, like, some- some, like,
00:33:14 genre. Like, like, Gibbs proposed, like, a YouTube poop lecture that may or may not exist one day.
00:33:19 Something like that. And with all the, like, things that you wouldn't find scrolling through
00:33:24 the fucking Wikipedia article, you know, that you can bring to the forefront and make interesting to
00:33:28 people. That's- that's what I like about it so much.
00:33:31 The thing about the YouTube- I was considering that for a while. I think the thing about the
00:33:35 YouTube poop lecture is that it would make far more sense as a video where you can show examples
00:33:41 of things. Because if I'm just talking about, like, hundreds upon hundreds of different styles of
00:33:46 video editing, but I'm not doing video editing-
00:33:48 You could do it as a lecture. If you just, like, mentioned, like, it'd be almost like a political,
00:33:53 like, a military battle. Like, you describe what, like, X General did with his troops and how that,
00:33:58 like, changed the board over some span.
00:33:59 Maybe. I feel like- I feel like the person who would do better at, like, making a YouTube poop
00:34:04 style, like, explanation is Emperor Lemon, because he's done stuff like that before,
00:34:09 and he was in, like, you know, the community at the time. He has more insight on-
00:34:13 You can even share a poops as well.
00:34:15 I- I mean, it's not about- I haven't made any, really, but, like, um, I don't know.
00:34:22 I feel like- I feel like it would require far more research in order to make a satisfying sort of
00:34:27 product.
00:34:28 Sure, sure. It's like how- all those guys who make those, like, fairly popular speedrunning videos,
00:34:34 generally they intersect with the story at some point, because they probably are speedrunners,
00:34:38 or were at some period of time, so they know this shit, uh, pretty in-depth.
00:34:44 That's been what I've noticed, anyway.
00:34:47 Hmm.
00:34:48 Hey, so-
00:34:49 I don't think of anything else.
00:34:50 Well, about- let's talk a little bit about the OVA and the fact that we all were anime girls
00:34:55 for a while there.
00:34:56 Oh, okay, sure.
00:34:58 Um, Lamau.
00:35:00 We could- we could, you know, if you guys want, we could, uh, perhaps provide some sort of hints,
00:35:06 perhaps of an image attached to this, or should we keep everything secretive?
00:35:10 I mean, well, that- that video already came out where, like, Ben and Munchie were in, like,
00:35:16 their costume.
00:35:17 It's true.
00:35:18 Not everyone was-
00:35:18 But that's just for backers, right?
00:35:21 Oh, is that just for backers?
00:35:22 That was probably-
00:35:23 I thought that was-
00:35:23 Was that one public?
00:35:24 Okay, okay, but one grainy phone video with a couple of us is different from, like, revealing
00:35:29 a full spread shot of all of us.
00:35:31 So, I don't know, I don't know.
00:35:33 Well, I'm more like talking about, like, the experience of doing it,
00:35:36 because I had, like, a bit of a weird, like, thing.
00:35:38 I think everyone else was just sort of like, ha-ha, this is funny, and I was like, uh, uh, uh,
00:35:43 lol, um, um, I kind of like this, uh, and I had that, like, that one tweet about, like-
00:35:50 Right.
00:35:51 Like, going a little crazy, going a little, like, um, I don't like admitting that I-
00:35:55 I'm wearing women's clothing and it's kind of cool.
00:35:59 Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
00:36:00 That's it, that's all I wanted to say.
00:36:03 I don't really know how to elaborate on it, it's just sort of an interesting-
00:36:06 I mean, I don't know, we all enjoy doing weird, silly stuff sometimes.
00:36:09 Maybe it does mean you're gay, who knows.
00:36:11 Maybe it does.
00:36:11 Good luck on your quest.
00:36:13 Yeah, I guess this isn't-
00:36:14 This podcast isn't really the best place to explore ideas of that nature, because, uh, lol.
00:36:20 But it was just, it was just a thing.
00:36:21 It was, it was a thing, I don't know, why is Ben muted?
00:36:27 I thought Ben would have something to say, because he was the one wearing makeup.
00:36:30 Yeah, like a big gay, as the days do.
00:36:33 Man, remember, remember how Ben was constantly like, I gotta go fix my makeup guys, and then
00:36:36 we'd have to wait, like, 10 minutes.
00:36:37 Yeah, if there's fucking stop shots, well, Ben fixes goddamn makeup, it's really annoying.
00:36:40 And then you would go to get Ben, and then Ben would come back, and you'd be inside doing
00:36:43 something, and be like, oh god.
00:36:45 That was a running gag.
00:36:46 It was-
00:36:46 It was always a chimilin ski.
00:36:48 Yeah, dead name, sorry.
00:36:50 Whoops, bleep that out, bleep that out.
00:36:53 It was always a teabag.
00:36:55 It was always a bestman.
00:36:57 Two best brothers delay production entirely.
00:37:00 How do we call, what is your fake brother name?
00:37:02 Is it, is it best saint?
00:37:03 We don't have a fake brother name, you can call us teabag, I guess.
00:37:05 It's standard, it's keg standard and substandard, that's canon.
00:37:08 That is true, that is true.
00:37:09 Jesus Christ.
00:37:10 That's the one name that unites fake fans, including the creators of characters, fake fans.
00:37:16 Disgusting.
00:37:18 Um, yeah, I mean, that, that whole production, I mean, none of it would, it's just that it
00:37:25 goes on for so long.
00:37:27 I mean, we filmed the OVA, and miraculously, we were, excuse me, able to get it done in
00:37:32 one day of filming.
00:37:34 And thank god for that, because we were dreading, like having to spend a second day, and probably
00:37:40 a large amount of the day, because we start things late, and because people are cowards
00:37:44 and weaklings.
00:37:45 Did you have to get up and come over?
00:37:46 Right, it's like a half an hour drive to the house.
00:37:49 You know, we should talk about, we should talk about the fucking dog, the dog that
00:37:53 tried to fuck up our, our shoot.
00:37:56 Sure, sure.
00:37:57 So while we were filming the music video, there, I won't describe in too much detail,
00:38:02 but at the, at the seminal shot, as like the lights are going down, the sun is setting,
00:38:08 and we're filming a very important dramatic shot for the music video, a fucking little
00:38:13 pug, it just walks into the frame, right where we're filming.
00:38:17 And okay, like, so some guys walk in his dog, and I think he had like two, there were two
00:38:21 ladies with him, I don't know if they were with him or whatever, and okay, that's fine.
00:38:24 They're there for a second, it's okay.
00:38:26 Okay, cut to like five minutes of this like teenage motherfucker, like lazily, slowly like
00:38:34 circling our group, like trying to get the dog, but really making just the least possible effort
00:38:41 to grab that fucking dog.
00:38:42 And I would have grabbed that dog, but I was indisposed and could not do it at the time.
00:38:47 And by the way, I love that dog.
00:38:48 He was cute and he was great, and I was happy to see him.
00:38:50 But nonetheless, we had a fucking job to do.
00:38:53 So this is not, not good timing.
00:38:55 And he was hard, I mean, he was a hard dog to catch, like I tried to grab it myself,
00:38:58 but he like skidded, scampered away like, like really fast.
00:39:03 But like the guy was just sort of, he was just sort of like amused and sort of standing and like,
00:39:10 what would you call it, like orbiter sort of did orbiter distance, better orbiter distance
00:39:18 around us.
00:39:19 Yeah, he was just kind of like watching with the used interest as all of us are freaks trying
00:39:25 to get this photo, like video thing done.
00:39:28 And he just made no effort to be like, hey, clear, you guys are in the middle of something.
00:39:32 Maybe I'll get my dog out of the way.
00:39:34 He's just kind of like standing there.
00:39:36 Dogs, am I right?
00:39:37 As it's like running around us.
00:39:39 If I can have a conversation with that man, maybe you can tell me why he is being such
00:39:43 a slow moving, uh, lackadaisical, because he doesn't know any of us.
00:39:47 He's too shy to come up and imagine your dog runs into a group of people,
00:39:54 not even clearly filming something, but just standing there and the dog is like fucking
00:40:00 with him and not fucking hustling at all to get that guy who jumped in.
00:40:06 Yeah, we're talking about the dog.
00:40:08 Yeah, fuck that guy.
00:40:10 Ben was really mad.
00:40:12 All of us were just like, haha.
00:40:13 Ben was the most mad.
00:40:14 But Ben, Ben was the most blatantly mad.
00:40:16 Like, like even when the guy was hanging around like, I'm gonna fucking kill that dog.
00:40:19 I'm gonna fucking kill that dog.
00:40:21 I mean, I was, I was like a little amused and a little annoyed when the dog showed up.
00:40:27 But like after the dog was like running around, like for a while, like while and like the guy
00:40:33 is right there and he could easily pick his fucking dog up and get him out of there.
00:40:38 And we're clearly doing something and don't want the dog there.
00:40:40 And the sun is setting as we have like a tiny window, sliver of time to finish this.
00:40:45 I'm like, oh god, we're gonna have to redo this entire shot tomorrow.
00:40:47 This dog doesn't get the fuck out of the way.
00:40:50 Yeah, yeah.
00:40:53 Well, he got him eventually, which, you know, the least he could do.
00:40:57 Better late than never, I guess.
00:40:59 We will obliterate him.
00:41:03 I don't know what, I don't know what.
00:41:05 Okay.
00:41:07 Nobody else said anything.
00:41:08 Like everyone else, you all just made fun of me for being mad.
00:41:12 But like clearly it wasn't a problem.
00:41:15 I just did like the dog.
00:41:17 That's all.
00:41:17 I was just sure.
00:41:19 The dog was fine.
00:41:20 We really did not have any use for him.
00:41:22 But at the time, like we really did have, I mean, probably like, I don't know,
00:41:28 half an hour to get this shot done.
00:41:29 And we were, it was like the very last thing.
00:41:31 And you know, it did take the dog maybe like, maybe up to like three,
00:41:35 four minutes to like be removed.
00:41:37 So like that wasn't, it wasn't like an ad coming back.
00:41:41 I don't think it was longer than that.
00:41:42 Those minutes are.
00:41:43 It definitely was.
00:41:44 Well, he came back.
00:41:45 And like came back a few times.
00:41:46 He came back a second time.
00:41:47 And it was, he was in like the final like drone shot.
00:41:50 And we were just like, oh god, that might be the best take.
00:41:52 He's in the fucking drone shot.
00:41:53 That piece of shit.
00:41:54 I think we have a shot that he will not be in as our final shot.
00:41:58 But I remember Victor saying that one with the dog was the best shot.
00:42:02 So it's not a problem if the dog is in the drone.
00:42:04 No, it's not.
00:42:05 But it's just like, come on, man, come on.
00:42:08 Yeah.
00:42:08 Yeah, he's cute.
00:42:10 The dog was also there.
00:42:12 That's the end of it.
00:42:12 I have no problem with the dog.
00:42:14 Including a dog increases production value.
00:42:16 Fucking not controlling their dog.
00:42:20 It is a public area that we were doing that in.
00:42:22 You're supposed to have dogs on a leash.
00:42:23 She was not on a leash.
00:42:24 She was just running around.
00:42:25 And you're not supposed to film without a permit.
00:42:26 So who's the real criminal?
00:42:28 What do you mean you're not supposed to film without a permit?
00:42:30 That's Victor.
00:42:31 You're not supposed to film.
00:42:32 That's it.
00:42:32 You're just not allowed to record a public place.
00:42:36 Yeah, it's barely public.
00:42:38 It's right outside the house.
00:42:39 You know better than Victor?
00:42:40 I don't.
00:42:40 That can't possibly be true.
00:42:43 On a phone?
00:42:44 I mean, I don't know.
00:42:45 Maybe it was specifically using the drone.
00:42:47 But that person would be the drone.
00:42:49 That's the only thing it would be is the drone.
00:42:51 Well, I think he specifically said filming.
00:42:53 And then the drone was a separate issue.
00:42:54 I have no idea.
00:42:55 No, there's no way.
00:42:57 What if you just take your phone out and film?
00:42:58 I don't care at all.
00:42:59 But, you know, I would do it anyway.
00:43:02 I don't give a shit.
00:43:04 It's pretty funny.
00:43:07 To put a cap on the whole like me,
00:43:08 like Ben, you weren't here when I started talking about like the.
00:43:12 Sorry, I suddenly had to shit really bad.
00:43:16 Lol.
00:43:16 Of course.
00:43:17 But what happened?
00:43:19 I was talking about the wearing of the OVA female attire.
00:43:25 And you with the me with the.
00:43:28 I'm just going to say it.
00:43:28 Fascination with the stuff.
00:43:30 I look the best.
00:43:31 I was the hottest girl.
00:43:33 That's not accurate.
00:43:36 That's not accurate.
00:43:37 Nate, you were the only one that even came close.
00:43:40 But I'm sorry.
00:43:41 You're second place.
00:43:42 You're second.
00:43:42 I see.
00:43:43 I see.
00:43:45 Nah, nah.
00:43:47 It was me.
00:43:48 It was me.
00:43:49 No.
00:43:49 La Ma.
00:43:50 This is shit.
00:43:52 And I am.
00:43:52 Everyone else was cringe.
00:43:53 And I was based.
00:43:55 I really.
00:43:55 It was really funny.
00:43:57 I had to ever like every ever after every couple shots.
00:43:59 I had to run inside and like redo my makeup.
00:44:02 We were talking about that.
00:44:03 It kept getting like we hated it.
00:44:04 It kept getting fucked up.
00:44:05 But it was worth it.
00:44:08 It was worth it.
00:44:08 Okay.
00:44:09 That's called commitment.
00:44:10 That's one word.
00:44:11 It was really funny.
00:44:12 Like like at various points where I wore like the punk costume.
00:44:17 Where people regularly did not realize that I was me.
00:44:21 And thought Michelle was in the house.
00:44:24 What did you say?
00:44:25 Well, did you said that?
00:44:26 Like he would see you give out of the quarter of his eye and be like,
00:44:28 Oh, is that Michelle?
00:44:29 Hold on.
00:44:29 I never thought that.
00:44:30 No.
00:44:31 That would make me fucking gay.
00:44:33 Yeah.
00:44:34 We all know Ben's gaydar is not active.
00:44:37 Digi's totally is.
00:44:39 Digi's definitely way gayer than Ben.
00:44:42 Indeed.
00:44:44 Yes.
00:44:45 Anyway, wearing women's clothes is based.
00:44:48 And that's all I gotta say.
00:44:51 I just thought it was funny that like day one
00:44:54 Gibbs on stream and everyone's like, Oh my God, Gib cut his head.
00:44:57 That's Gib.
00:44:57 I didn't even recognize him next day.
00:44:59 Gib dressed up as pump.
00:45:01 Where's Gib?
00:45:01 Who's the girl in the stream?
00:45:03 You were just a ninja.
00:45:04 I decide half the time.
00:45:06 I think I decided that I think makeup is cool.
00:45:09 And I sort of wish I could wear it.
00:45:11 Not in like a I want to like wear lipstick and look like a girl way.
00:45:14 I just think it's like cool that you could like just like paint stuff on your face to
00:45:20 make you look a certain way.
00:45:21 You can just kind of like apply imagery to yourself and the way you look.
00:45:27 I think that's neat.
00:45:28 It is pretty bad.
00:45:29 Ben leveled up and it unlocked new avatar customization.
00:45:32 He's really yeah.
00:45:34 Yeah, basically.
00:45:35 Alas, it has been.
00:45:36 What's the word?
00:45:37 Socialized as a feminine trait.
00:45:40 What can one do in this Western hegemony?
00:45:42 Why we got to abolish gender and then I can.
00:45:46 I don't know.
00:45:47 I can I can put I don't know what I put on my face.
00:45:51 I don't know.
00:45:51 Some just like I'll just probably come.
00:45:53 Probably come mostly would be the just draw some common there.
00:45:59 That's pretty manly.
00:46:00 Right.
00:46:00 That's like the manliest substance there is.
00:46:03 Here you go.
00:46:03 It comes straight from the man.
00:46:06 Yep.
00:46:06 Straight from the store.
00:46:07 Pure testosterone.
00:46:08 People will walk by and I'll be like, no, no, no, no.
00:46:10 It's my own cum.
00:46:11 You fucking fag.
00:46:16 That's what I'll say.
00:46:17 That's what I'll say.
00:46:17 I'll get arrested.
00:46:18 You know, here's something interesting I was thinking about.
00:46:20 Like when we were leaving the house,
00:46:21 I was like, we didn't get nearly attached to the location
00:46:25 as we did last time.
00:46:26 Because if I recall during ragcon three,
00:46:28 there were like multiple times when we were like,
00:46:30 oh, we got to do a fucking house tour.
00:46:31 We got to go through the entire house and like explore it
00:46:33 and like show it off in videos.
00:46:34 I don't think we did that for.
00:46:36 For this was way nicer for the first one.
00:46:39 It definitely was.
00:46:40 Right.
00:46:41 Country was like, whoa, didn't you do that like the first day
00:46:45 when you saw when weren't you running around filming the house
00:46:48 and like doing a tour of the house
00:46:49 and you found the like the bloody footprints
00:46:51 and smears and stuff?
00:46:54 I mean, I wasn't.
00:46:55 I don't know if we were recording that.
00:46:56 I think it was just happening.
00:46:57 I swear.
00:46:57 I swear someone was filming that.
00:46:59 It definitely got filmed in one of the videos or something.
00:47:02 But I mean, one of the things that I had in mind,
00:47:04 like I really wanted to do a house tour
00:47:06 of ragcon three house, the arena,
00:47:09 specifically because I was hoping someone would make
00:47:12 a quake stage using the map of the arena.
00:47:15 So that was my biggest motivation.
00:47:17 No one has done that.
00:47:18 But the challenge is still open.
00:47:20 Someone wants to do that.
00:47:22 Although I just don't want to wake the other day
00:47:24 to make room for doom eternal on my computer.
00:47:26 I mean, it's been two years since ragcon three.
00:47:28 I think if anyone were going to do that,
00:47:30 they would have done it by now.
00:47:31 It's true.
00:47:31 True.
00:47:32 Someone's just been working away this entire time.
00:47:34 Like he started day one.
00:47:35 He's still putting the finishing touches on everything.
00:47:37 Hey, maybe.
00:47:39 I just remembered that we forgot to put patches
00:47:42 from Dark Souls into the Royal Rumble.
00:47:45 Oh, we didn't put patches, did we?
00:47:47 That's pretty true.
00:47:48 That's pretty fringe.
00:47:50 The Royal Rumble was another event of note
00:47:54 that we used some, I don't know.
00:47:56 It was this election of memes was interesting
00:47:59 considering now we've really got a large pantheon
00:48:02 and not everybody can fit even in like the 40 man one.
00:48:06 Such amazing characters as Big Dig,
00:48:08 the Samurai Ning who made it in.
00:48:11 Everybody loves that guy.
00:48:13 God, did you know he's just so shit all the time?
00:48:15 Can we just, you know, so bullshit?
00:48:18 At least he now has purple hair girl who I actually like
00:48:21 and is a good design that is cool.
00:48:24 So that's one.
00:48:25 You got one Digi.
00:48:26 Your whole light novel cast of characters, they're all fine.
00:48:28 He said that character just is Sabrina.
00:48:31 Oh, that's right.
00:48:32 She's Sabrina from Pokemon.
00:48:34 Just Sabrina.
00:48:35 That's very true.
00:48:36 But to be fair, like every anime character
00:48:38 is just some shitty trope with a different hair color.
00:48:40 That's true.
00:48:41 So, you know.
00:48:42 That's pretty base, dude.
00:48:43 I love anime.
00:48:45 It's well done.
00:48:46 They save us the trouble of like having to like get to know
00:48:48 or understand the peculiarities of new characters.
00:48:50 Yeah, because you can just see someone.
00:48:51 Oh, I know what this person's deal is.
00:48:53 No worries.
00:48:54 Sick, dude.
00:48:55 I love...
00:48:57 I love that.
00:48:58 Modernity?
00:48:59 I don't know.
00:49:00 I don't even know what I'm supposed to complain about.
00:49:00 I love modernity.
00:49:03 Modernity, yeah.
00:49:06 So how do you think the Royal Rumble
00:49:07 stacked up to old eras?
00:49:08 Because we had a new champion this time.
00:49:10 We're not going to spoil who it is, right?
00:49:14 We can save it.
00:49:15 I mean, people could have watched it any time.
00:49:16 We're not going to...
00:49:17 Oh, wait, it's already out.
00:49:18 Yeah, we live streamed it.
00:49:19 Oh, I'm so fucking dumb.
00:49:20 Yeah.
00:49:21 Yeah, no.
00:49:22 The ending was hype.
00:49:24 I don't know if noise ninja winning...
00:49:28 I don't know if the HTB guy winning was as hype
00:49:30 as the arm retrieval arm.
00:49:31 The arm defeating...
00:49:32 No, the arm was way too hype.
00:49:34 Especially the pose at the end.
00:49:36 The pose at the end, yeah.
00:49:37 But we were...
00:49:38 It was hard to beat that.
00:49:39 Perfect.
00:49:39 At the end, we were all definitely rooting
00:49:41 for noise ninja at the end.
00:49:43 Especially since Brad...
00:49:44 It didn't look like he was going to win,
00:49:46 but he pulled it out.
00:49:47 Especially since up until that point,
00:49:49 I had kind of forgotten that Brad Garlinghouse
00:49:50 was in the Rumble and he came in right at the end.
00:49:53 He was the last guy.
00:49:53 He had a good chance.
00:49:54 Like the best part.
00:49:55 A really good chance of winning.
00:49:56 It's like, shit.
00:49:58 After all this time, Brad's going to come back
00:49:59 and destroy the channel once again.
00:50:00 I was terrified he was going to win.
00:50:02 How bad, how sad would that have been
00:50:04 if Brad didn't won the Rumble?
00:50:05 The optics would have been all wrong.
00:50:07 It would not have been good.
00:50:08 Yeah, I know.
00:50:09 Thank God.
00:50:10 No, no, it didn't happen.
00:50:11 I mean, I loved having him there for the lecture,
00:50:13 of course.
00:50:13 We all loved having him.
00:50:15 Absolutely.
00:50:16 Pleasure, Brad, come back any time.
00:50:20 But also, fuck you.
00:50:23 Oh, wait.
00:50:23 Chemonically.
00:50:24 Is he even alive anymore?
00:50:25 I don't know.
00:50:26 Oh, shoot.
00:50:27 Yeah, he's alive.
00:50:28 Oh, sure.
00:50:28 Chemonically.
00:50:29 A ripple tanked and he committed suicide.
00:50:32 In some sense.
00:50:34 He must live.
00:50:36 He's got to live.
00:50:37 There must always be a Brad Garlinghouse.
00:50:42 A Garlinghouse is chained in the basement of my Garlinghouse,
00:50:46 and that's where he'll stay for all time.
00:50:49 It's like the Santa Claus.
00:50:51 Like if you kill Brad Garlinghouse,
00:50:53 you become the new Brad Garlinghouse,
00:50:56 and you start finding garlic in your pockets.
00:50:59 And you get your bank account and just skyrocket.
00:51:02 It goes to the moon, in a word, in a phrase.
00:51:06 We've got to do Redcon right now.
00:51:07 We've got to do Redcon again.
00:51:09 Redcon 5 to the moon.
00:51:11 It's in space.
00:51:12 It's on the moon.
00:51:14 We do it on the top of up.
00:51:16 It just feels like we were working the whole time.
00:51:18 We didn't really hang out enough.
00:51:20 We didn't stream.
00:51:21 There wasn't enough casual streaming just to be cool.
00:51:23 I do think of enough.
00:51:25 I do think the reason why it felt that...
00:51:28 Yeah, I don't feel like I got to hang out with everyone.
00:51:31 I don't feel like we hung out as much.
00:51:33 Even though I was there for less of Redcon 3,
00:51:35 I feel like I did more just hanging out.
00:51:38 Yeah.
00:51:39 And a lot of the time we were all spending
00:51:42 when we weren't doing a video or streaming
00:51:44 was typing up things for research notes
00:51:48 for the lectures we were all doing
00:51:50 and just looking at our phones.
00:51:52 It's like we're all scared about the coronavirus
00:51:55 and just looking at things like,
00:51:56 hey, do you know about this thing
00:51:57 that just happened in the coronavirus Twitter feed?
00:52:00 And it's like, yes, yes, we all know.
00:52:02 Lol, scared, cry, cry emoji.
00:52:06 I got to say, I looked like a real...
00:52:07 I didn't even walk on the beach enough times.
00:52:09 I wanted to do that more.
00:52:11 Yeah, that's important.
00:52:12 On the last day before we left,
00:52:14 I went out for one final walk up the beach
00:52:16 and I looked at one of those big weird pipes
00:52:18 sticking out of the sand and was like, hmm, bizarre.
00:52:21 Those are cool.
00:52:22 Speaking of the coronavirus,
00:52:24 I walked to Whole Foods today
00:52:25 and I looked like a fucking urban ninja
00:52:28 because I was wearing...
00:52:29 I was wearing like...
00:52:31 Well, when I went into Whole Foods,
00:52:32 I put on gloves and I wore a scarf over my face
00:52:35 because you're not supposed to breathe on stuff.
00:52:37 Right, right.
00:52:38 And nobody else was doing it
00:52:40 and I kind of started to feel stupid,
00:52:42 but I'm like, no, no, I'm right.
00:52:46 They're wrong.
00:52:47 I'm doing what I'm supposed to do.
00:52:49 Yeah, that's true.
00:52:50 Massachusetts is gonna get closed down soon
00:52:52 if they're not already doing it.
00:52:53 I was gonna ask, what's the status
00:52:54 of everybody's state or country or location?
00:52:56 Ohio just said they were locking down, right?
00:52:58 Like today?
00:52:59 I don't fucking listen to the news.
00:53:01 If you say so, okay.
00:53:02 Yeah, because my friend Ashley lives in Ohio
00:53:04 and she messaged me and was like,
00:53:06 yeah, they're locking it down until April 6th.
00:53:08 Wait, who does?
00:53:09 My friend Ashley.
00:53:10 Ohio, apparently.
00:53:11 Oh, yeah.
00:53:12 I have heard that they might lock down Massachusetts
00:53:16 or some part of it soon,
00:53:18 but they haven't done it yet.
00:53:20 I don't know.
00:53:21 Well, fair enough.
00:53:23 It's probably a good idea.
00:53:24 Honestly, I won't make a difference to me at all.
00:53:27 Because even if it's locked down,
00:53:29 even if it's locked down,
00:53:30 you're still allowed to go out and buy food.
00:53:32 Yeah, which is all I do.
00:53:34 That's the only reason I would leave my house anyway.
00:53:36 So like, whatever.
00:53:38 All this time, we were all preparing for our global pandemic.
00:53:41 Our lives were not pathetic.
00:53:43 We were just ahead of the curve.
00:53:45 It's a great time to be a neat, truly great time.
00:53:47 I'm the most patriotic guy around.
00:53:50 I'm doing my duty.
00:53:52 Yeah.
00:53:55 I love being a doom boy.
00:53:58 Doom Eternal is great and I love it.
00:54:00 I'm glad it exists.
00:54:02 And thank you, God, for making it for me.
00:54:04 It was really nice of you to do that.
00:54:06 God didn't make it.
00:54:07 This isn't a Christian game.
00:54:08 They made this a person who made this game.
00:54:10 Because you're going to kill God.
00:54:11 Or I don't know yet,
00:54:12 but you wouldn't go to heaven or something.
00:54:14 And I can't wait to kill God.
00:54:15 One of the tenants of Christianity
00:54:16 is that you kill God at the end.
00:54:17 You must kill God.
00:54:18 Well, they literally did that in Christianity, bro.
00:54:20 Remember that?
00:54:22 They did.
00:54:22 I mean, it sure was frowned upon, but it did happen.
00:54:25 They put them on a tree and they caught them.
00:54:28 They stabbed them in the chest.
00:54:30 They crucified them.
00:54:32 That's how it went down.
00:54:34 Pretty based.
00:54:36 Oh, I got nothing to say.
00:54:38 Doom is good.
00:54:39 Tom, I saw, of notes, just while we're on the subject,
00:54:41 I saw you saying, I think on Twitter,
00:54:42 that something about it didn't click as much for you.
00:54:45 What was that about?
00:54:45 Yeah, I'm not.
00:54:46 How do you, how so?
00:54:47 So far, I just beat the first boss, the doom hunters.
00:54:51 I just got to them this morning.
00:54:53 And I don't think I like it as much as 2016.
00:54:57 I think they went too far.
00:54:59 I think it's too frenetic.
00:55:01 I think it's too much.
00:55:03 I think the game has so many tools available to you.
00:55:07 I feel like it requires the precision of a mouse,
00:55:10 but it has so many functions and things to do
00:55:13 that it wants a gamepad for all the buttons you have to hit.
00:55:17 And I feel like there's so much going on in the game
00:55:22 that the first person perspective is a detriment.
00:55:24 And if this game was developed as a new IP,
00:55:26 it would have been a third person shooter
00:55:28 because of the situational awareness
00:55:30 you need in order to play the game function well.
00:55:32 I do find myself scrambling to remember
00:55:35 all the buttons for weapons I have available on my, you know.
00:55:39 They're all, they're all like necessary,
00:55:41 like using the grenades necessary, using the flamethrower.
00:55:43 You got to use that flamethrower to get the armor.
00:55:45 You got to be bashing people.
00:55:47 Yeah, I mean, that's true.
00:55:47 So it's all, it's not like you can just like
00:55:49 settle into your favorite really.
00:55:51 You got to, you got to use every tool at your disposal.
00:55:54 And so for all those buttons, I'm like,
00:55:58 this is clearly designed for a gamepad.
00:56:00 But then like, because you have to hit certain sweet spots
00:56:03 on the enemies, it's like playing this with,
00:56:05 like dual analog aiming would be a nightmare.
00:56:07 So it's like, you're trapped between two things.
00:56:10 And yeah, I just feel like it's a lot.
00:56:15 Is this compared to 2016 or classic due?
00:56:17 2016, 2016 was like, was frenetic, but not nearly as much.
00:56:22 Like they clearly dialed everything up to 11.
00:56:24 And as much as I like a lot of the improvements,
00:56:28 like the dashing and stuff is like really fucking sick.
00:56:30 Yeah, I love that.
00:56:31 It just feels like, I mean, I don't think it's a bad game.
00:56:34 I still am having a lot of fun with it.
00:56:36 I just liked 2016 more because it felt like more cohesive,
00:56:42 I suppose, in terms, I never, I never felt like,
00:56:46 I felt like exhausted at the end of a lot of the encounters
00:56:48 in 2016, but never like overly so.
00:56:51 Because like the Doom Hunter boss,
00:56:52 because I don't know how far you are, you're in.
00:56:54 I fought them, yeah, at least to that point.
00:56:56 It just takes too long, because like.
00:56:59 You got to switch between your fucking energy beam
00:57:02 and then you got to go to like rockets to blast the bottom
00:57:04 and then the shields back up.
00:57:05 And I'm out of energy bullets now,
00:57:07 so we got to go chainsaw people to get back,
00:57:09 you know, ammo and everything.
00:57:11 It's a lot, it's a lot.
00:57:12 The intensity is like always at an 11.
00:57:15 And I'm fine with that, but like it goes on for too long.
00:57:18 Like it just becomes monotonous,
00:57:20 because like the boss, you're fighting him
00:57:22 and you're like, all right, I'm almost done with the boss.
00:57:23 And they're like, oh no, he has multiple life bars, fuck.
00:57:26 So you're still going and then like you kill him,
00:57:28 you're like, all right, I did it.
00:57:29 And then you drop down the hole, now there's two of them.
00:57:31 And it's just like too much, too much, too much.
00:57:34 Like if this encounter came later, fine.
00:57:37 But like putting them back to back, like no, no, no.
00:57:39 Like you're firing on all cylinders for too long,
00:57:42 pacing, very important.
00:57:45 I see your point.
00:57:46 I don't know if I quite agree,
00:57:47 but I certainly do feel like my fingers are stretched
00:57:50 to the limit.
00:57:51 And it is a lot to keep track of at any given point.
00:57:54 Okay, anyway, anyway, there's your little doom review,
00:57:56 doom eternal.
00:57:57 I'm very excited to play more though.
00:57:58 And I can't wait to go back.
00:57:59 I'm definitely going to finish.
00:58:00 Yeah, no, no, I'm actually,
00:58:02 I didn't do this in DOOM 2016, because I, oh my God,
00:58:04 I played that on Switch, Jesus Christ.
00:58:07 What a fucking retard I was.
00:58:09 But I have this one on PC, thank God.
00:58:11 And I mean, I'm actually really excited.
00:58:14 The first perks I got were like,
00:58:15 where all items are on the map and like how to,
00:58:18 like what items they are.
00:58:20 So now I, after I beat a level,
00:58:21 I'll immediately go back and get all the secrets I missed.
00:58:24 Oh, it's so much fun.
00:58:25 Oh, I really like it.
00:58:26 Really, really good game.
00:58:28 I should do that with 2016 as well.
00:58:30 I should play it again.
00:58:31 Okay, anyway, anyway, enough of that.
00:58:33 Did anybody get Animal Crossing?
00:58:35 Just out of curiosity,
00:58:36 because this is the other one everybody's talking about.
00:58:38 I've never been, I've never been a big Animal Crossing guy.
00:58:40 I played one Animal Crossing on like the DS,
00:58:43 I think for a bit.
00:58:45 I played that game a ton on the DS.
00:58:48 Wild World?
00:58:48 Maybe we were playing the same copy.
00:58:50 No, Wild World was the three DS.
00:58:52 What?
00:58:53 I thought that was the DS one.
00:58:55 Oh, okay.
00:58:55 I thought New Leaf was the three DS one, right?
00:58:58 Oh, you know, maybe you're, hang on,
00:59:00 fucking DS, Animal Crossing.
00:59:01 Cometers, let me know if I'm based a cringe on this.
00:59:05 Okay, you are correct.
00:59:06 It was Wild World, okay.
00:59:07 Hell yeah.
00:59:08 That's the one I played a ton.
00:59:11 But I want to get it,
00:59:13 but I think I will lose time and efficiency if I own it.
00:59:18 So I'm being a responsible adult and not buying it,
00:59:21 even though it does look pretty fun,
00:59:22 because now you can like customize your town
00:59:25 and you can like actually shape the terrain and the geography.
00:59:28 Something I've always wanted to do in Animal Crossing,
00:59:30 but I'll be a good boy.
00:59:32 Oh, plus we're on a tropical island, which is-
00:59:34 It's on brand.
00:59:36 Radcon, for Paradise Anybody.
00:59:39 Do you get it?
00:59:39 Mm-hmm, I see where you're going.
00:59:42 I'm picking up what you're putting down here.
00:59:44 Oh, it's fun.
00:59:45 They're cool games, but whatever.
00:59:47 Oh my God, guys, are you like shipping?
00:59:49 Like I am like Doom Guy with Isabelle,
00:59:52 because like their game's like same day, bro?
00:59:55 What if different game, but same day,
00:59:59 characters had sex?
01:00:01 What if?
01:00:03 Are people doing it?
01:00:03 She's just a dog.
01:00:06 She's just a small dog.
01:00:07 You can't have sex with a small dog.
01:00:09 I've seen a lot of fans on 4chan.
01:00:10 Well, you're on 4chan.
01:00:12 That's your first bra.
01:00:13 Bro, but the deep lore is that the fucking-
01:00:16 The Doom Guy had a pet bunny.
01:00:18 I know Isabelle is a chow-chow, but it doesn't matter.
01:00:21 Small cute animal that he loved, and then it died or something,
01:00:24 and that's what made him so mad, among other things.
01:00:26 So it's like he has a history of loving cute little animals.
01:00:30 So he could definitely be shipped with Isabelle by me,
01:00:33 and it would be totally legit.
01:00:35 It's based.
01:00:37 I know this is what people want and are dying to hear about,
01:00:40 so you're welcome, bro.
01:00:41 I'm keeping you up to date.
01:00:42 Yeah, yeah.
01:00:43 Okay, video game talk over.
01:00:46 Ooh, finally.
01:00:48 What else is going on in the world?
01:00:50 How about the corona?
01:00:51 We can talk about the corona a little bit.
01:00:52 I feel like I talked about that.
01:00:54 We're going to get demonetized.
01:00:55 I guess you're right.
01:00:56 You're literally not around talking about the outfit.
01:00:58 I've got something that I've just sort of realized,
01:01:02 which is going to bring the mood down.
01:01:04 I might die.
01:01:05 I might be going to die.
01:01:09 But on the plane ride home, I was feeling kind of cramped,
01:01:14 and then when I got home, I had diarrhea and a fever,
01:01:16 and I was like, ah, shit.
01:01:18 Of all the things to get,
01:01:20 it was something that wasn't the coronavirus,
01:01:22 but still hurts a lot.
01:01:25 I'm looking up the thing,
01:01:26 because Digi just said symptoms of that do arise with coronavirus.
01:01:32 And I looked it up.
01:01:33 Apparently, it's less likely, but it does happen.
01:01:36 So I might have had the coronavirus this whole time.
01:01:40 It's possible.
01:01:40 I mean, we were saying before,
01:01:42 I was feeling a little under the weather.
01:01:44 I skipped my last two streams,
01:01:45 because I haven't felt great the last couple of days.
01:01:47 Like, sure.
01:01:47 Theoretically, it's possible.
01:01:49 If you came to the meetup and you talk to me, I'm sorry.
01:01:55 I mean, maybe they infected you.
01:01:57 They should apologize to you, Gib.
01:01:59 I mean, it's possible, I suppose.
01:02:02 But you can never be sure of these things.
01:02:04 I'm just going to say whoops in case.
01:02:08 But it also says there's a higher mortality rate
01:02:10 for people who have the diarrhea alongside
01:02:14 and it also says that you could have the diarrhea,
01:02:18 but without the coughing, which is why I didn't think I had it.
01:02:21 So I haven't been coughing at all.
01:02:24 I should probably fucking get myself tested.
01:02:27 You know, the funny thing about the testing,
01:02:29 when I just didn't feel great, I was like,
01:02:30 I guess I'll just go to the doctor and get tested or whatever.
01:02:33 You can't, because there's not enough testing.
01:02:36 It's only for medical personnel.
01:02:38 And I think it was like people confirmed to have it.
01:02:41 Okay, well, that doesn't make sense.
01:02:42 Why would they test if they know they have it?
01:02:44 I don't know.
01:02:44 It was very limited.
01:02:45 It might have been government officials or something.
01:02:47 For me, I assume it's going to be a waiting list sort of deal.
01:02:53 You press 111 on your phone right now in the UK,
01:02:56 and you get the coronavirus hotline.
01:02:59 Get Munchie's voice in the door.
01:03:01 Do you have coronavirus?
01:03:04 And I say yes.
01:03:04 As he does.
01:03:06 Yes.
01:03:06 And say, okay, go to bed and stay there.
01:03:10 Maybe I should do like an I'm dying stream,
01:03:14 where I just play a branching clank or something.
01:03:17 Because I don't expect to be able to get into a hospital at this point.
01:03:20 There's so many fucking people already with the thing.
01:03:23 The webcam's just going to go up.
01:03:25 You in bed wrapped up in blankets.
01:03:28 We'll just clarify.
01:03:29 I should definitely try to get a test.
01:03:32 And if I can't, then I'll try to rest it off.
01:03:35 Because I assumed the diary had stopped.
01:03:39 It was all fine.
01:03:40 It was just a little bit of stomach bug.
01:03:42 Yeah.
01:03:43 But I'm not perfectly fine.
01:03:45 So it could be like the beginning signs of having the coronavirus,
01:03:48 or my start coughing soon.
01:03:50 We'll just clarify.
01:03:51 If this is the beginning of my death.
01:03:54 Well, I can be ignorant about this.
01:03:56 I think I know the gist though, or at least some of the facts,
01:04:00 that like, I mean, you don't feel deathly ill,
01:04:02 as I understand it.
01:04:03 You're just concerned that you may have this specific illness.
01:04:06 I have like a very vague headache.
01:04:07 Almost no chance that you'd be seriously hurt by it.
01:04:12 Well, I mean, when I was like in my massive pain,
01:04:15 like when I came back and I had the diarrhea,
01:04:17 and it was like fever,
01:04:19 I couldn't really eat anything,
01:04:20 otherwise I'd vomit it up.
01:04:22 And I couldn't really, you know,
01:04:23 it was just sort of like, couldn't retain water.
01:04:26 It was very painful.
01:04:26 Okay, sure, sure.
01:04:27 I was in bed for an entire day and a half,
01:04:30 and I couldn't sleep.
01:04:31 So if that happens again, that will be bad.
01:04:34 That's not good, okay.
01:04:35 That's not good.
01:04:37 So I assume I'm over the worst of it,
01:04:41 because, you know, I'm like 26.
01:04:44 I'm not likely to have a, you know, massive thing.
01:04:49 But I don't know how this thing propagates.
01:04:50 Does it come in waves?
01:04:53 Maybe it does.
01:04:53 No, I'm not really sure.
01:04:55 Like, can I feel better and then feel worse later?
01:04:58 I'm not sure.
01:04:58 I mean, it's probably possible,
01:05:00 because like, if you're like something happened
01:05:03 and like your immune system got worse for some reason,
01:05:06 and it got a second foothold on, I don't know,
01:05:10 your body fights it off.
01:05:11 And like, if you're healthy, most of the,
01:05:13 if you're not ancient and you're healthy-ish,
01:05:17 most of the time your body fights it off in your esophagus
01:05:20 before it gets to your lungs.
01:05:22 And then you're, and that's when you have mild.
01:05:25 You get bad coronavirus if it gets to your lungs.
01:05:27 That's the confusing thing.
01:05:28 That's the confusing thing, though,
01:05:30 is like, if it's going to my intestines instead,
01:05:32 like, could it then...
01:05:34 Well, it wouldn't be the virus.
01:05:36 It's not, the virus is not in your intestines.
01:05:38 It would be, I don't know,
01:05:39 some kind of secondary bodily response.
01:05:42 In your butthole, just hanging out,
01:05:44 converting poop to diarrhea as it passes through.
01:05:47 It's a tricky one.
01:05:48 Maybe I sat on a virus and fisted to dildo it,
01:05:52 and that's what caused it.
01:05:53 Well...
01:05:55 I heard one fact that,
01:05:56 I mean, I don't forget where I heard this,
01:05:58 but I heard, I'm hearing so many of these things
01:06:00 that may or may not be true.
01:06:01 I've heard that like, 99% of people,
01:06:03 I believe who died,
01:06:05 only died because they had a second,
01:06:07 like, debilitating illness
01:06:09 that made them particularly vulnerable to the corona.
01:06:12 I mean, usually, yeah.
01:06:14 Usually, yeah.
01:06:14 Like, it's not necessarily the case.
01:06:16 That's true, it's 99% it's not 100%.
01:06:17 It's not guaranteed.
01:06:18 You can have, I think there have been cases
01:06:20 of like someone with, like, a young, healthy person
01:06:22 with no underlying issues can like,
01:06:24 just get real unlucky,
01:06:26 and like, they'll go to fucking critical condition,
01:06:28 because like, it gets in their lungs
01:06:30 and it fucks them up and they can't breathe
01:06:31 and they need to be respirated or they die.
01:06:33 It's, be afraid, people.
01:06:36 Be afraid.
01:06:37 Yeah, I'd run it in the sight of being afraid.
01:06:40 Yeah.
01:06:42 Well, yeah, I mean, if you feel bad.
01:06:42 I'm gonna deal with that as soon as we're done here.
01:06:46 Yep, that seems like the right thing to do.
01:06:48 And I would encourage anybody who feels similar to Gabe,
01:06:50 if you feel, you know, this level of bad,
01:06:52 if you just got a little cold, I'm sure you're fine.
01:06:54 But if you got, you know, any of the symptoms he's saying,
01:06:56 that's, you know, reasonable to get that kicked out.
01:06:57 Something to consider,
01:06:59 because I, like, a couple days ago, I Googled,
01:07:02 like, what are the symptoms of corona again?
01:07:03 Oh, respiratory problems, cough.
01:07:06 Okay, I don't have that.
01:07:07 Fever, cough, trouble breathing.
01:07:08 Yeah.
01:07:09 If you don't have that, it's probably not coronavirus.
01:07:12 But I do have the fever.
01:07:13 And so with this, like, diarrhea thing,
01:07:16 it's like, that's linked.
01:07:18 If all you have is a fever.
01:07:20 There's probable cause.
01:07:22 There's probable, what's the word, to, like,
01:07:24 there's reason to suspect.
01:07:26 Yeah, I don't, I don't know.
01:07:28 If all you have is a fever,
01:07:30 it's way more likely to be something else.
01:07:33 Like, there's plenty of things,
01:07:34 there's plenty of more common things that cause fever.
01:07:37 Like a cold or a flu.
01:07:39 Maybe, but like, not many fever things cause diarrhea.
01:07:43 I'm just saying, I just looked this up.
01:07:45 Do they?
01:07:47 Yeah, sure.
01:07:48 Yeah, plenty of, you can definitely get diarrhea
01:07:50 when you just have a cold or a flu.
01:07:52 The virus does not, like, directly cause that.
01:07:55 The virus is in your lungs.
01:07:57 So if, if you don't have, like, breathing problems,
01:08:01 I mean, it's probably not coronavirus.
01:08:03 Most likely, I mean, it could be anything's possible.
01:08:06 I'll, I'll check it,
01:08:07 cause I'm, I'm all spooked by this new knowledge,
01:08:10 but whatever.
01:08:12 Okay, I'm, you're, it doesn't sound like
01:08:14 it's likely to be coronavirus.
01:08:17 If it was something significantly worse.
01:08:19 Who knows?
01:08:20 Sure.
01:08:20 Yeah, definitely.
01:08:21 Right.
01:08:21 Oh, it's way more likely to be something much worse.
01:08:24 It's, what could it be?
01:08:26 At least it's not, at least it's not,
01:08:28 if it's something worse,
01:08:29 at least I won't kill my family with it.
01:08:31 That's the whole thing.
01:08:33 Oh, no.
01:08:33 Oh, you will.
01:08:35 Oh, no.
01:08:36 It's way more, whatever it is.
01:08:38 You will kill them,
01:08:39 but it won't be related to the virus.
01:08:40 You're just going to get mad, you've got chainsaw,
01:08:42 and just fucking massacre them all.
01:08:44 Maybe I got coronavirus too.
01:08:47 And I'm going to propagate vans from the UK.
01:08:50 The coronavirus too comes out.
01:08:51 You got the HD reaster of coronavirus, you know?
01:08:54 Yeah, it's like it's bigger,
01:08:56 better, and stronger too.
01:08:57 It's the second member of the coronavirus crew.
01:09:01 COVID.
01:09:03 COVID-19.
01:09:04 COVID-19.
01:09:04 No, COVID-20.
01:09:06 And then COVID-21,
01:09:07 and then Goku comes back,
01:09:08 and he's like,
01:09:09 I'm not going to die anymore,
01:09:10 and he punches the virus.
01:09:11 Damn.
01:09:12 Remember that?
01:09:12 Remember Dragon Ball?
01:09:14 I do remember Dragon Ball.
01:09:17 Epic.
01:09:19 Hey, me too.
01:09:21 Well, I mean, if you guys want,
01:09:23 I've got the voicemails,
01:09:24 but if you've got anything else you want to talk about,
01:09:26 feel free.
01:09:27 Have we given the people their money's worth yet?
01:09:30 I mean, it's over an hour.
01:09:30 We're only an hour and 10 minutes.
01:09:33 I feel like it's been three weeks
01:09:35 since we had a fucking episode.
01:09:37 Yeah, let me look up the list of things
01:09:40 that happened during Ritecoin
01:09:41 if there's something we didn't talk about.
01:09:44 Did you keep a journal or a list?
01:09:47 I kept a little gay journal, you know?
01:09:50 Hey, you know, I'll let you look that up.
01:09:51 I'll give people one interesting fact
01:09:53 that I just think is fun.
01:09:55 So while we were at Radcon,
01:09:56 we've been talking about like,
01:09:57 so the reality of Radcon is that like,
01:10:01 we got like $34,000 or whatever,
01:10:03 but much of that we knew would be absorbed.
01:10:06 Like a minimum of $10,000,
01:10:08 and that's before all the additional stretch goals
01:10:10 we promised in order to just to break even.
01:10:13 So I mean, that seems like,
01:10:14 okay, it's like $24,000 cleared.
01:10:16 Great.
01:10:17 But then also there's, you know, production stuff,
01:10:20 various things that are also going to eat in that.
01:10:21 Okay, cool.
01:10:22 So what I did finally after Radcon was
01:10:24 we've been documenting all of our expenses and stuff.
01:10:27 And what I have now is a running spreadsheet
01:10:29 that like every expense I can now plug into that thing.
01:10:32 And at the bottom, what it has is it spits out
01:10:35 like how much profit each of us is going to make off the top.
01:10:39 And I'm not going to talk about how much it is,
01:10:41 because that's private information.
01:10:42 But it's fun for me to watch
01:10:44 as every expense gets added to it,
01:10:47 like how that number goes down.
01:10:49 And we want to maximize our income, obviously.
01:10:52 While delivering on each of the promises that we've made,
01:10:54 because that's the agreement, of course.
01:10:56 But it's a fun exercise of me, spreadsheet man,
01:10:59 that's my superhero name,
01:11:01 to be upkeeping that with all the expenses
01:11:05 and being just really mad at all of you guys
01:11:08 for daring to expense anything
01:11:10 and not just giving money for free for no reason
01:11:14 to all of us so that we can all make more money.
01:11:16 It's very selfish of you guys.
01:11:18 You know what I'm saying?
01:11:19 Yeah.
01:11:20 True.
01:11:22 Guilty as charged.
01:11:24 That's capitalism.
01:11:25 I love making money is the point of that.
01:11:27 Expensing things was so cool.
01:11:29 It felt so cool every time I would go shopping
01:11:33 and be like, uh-huh.
01:11:34 Yeah, I'm spending all this money on groceries for the house.
01:11:37 We actually have money to cover the things we need
01:11:39 to make Radcom this time.
01:11:40 Spending all this money on groceries at the house,
01:11:42 put it on my tag.
01:11:44 Put it on the expense account.
01:11:46 Yeah, work will cover, yeah, on the expense account.
01:11:48 It felt like a real jet set radio.
01:11:52 If you know what I mean.
01:11:53 It's fucking great.
01:11:55 God, if we just, if we clear like a little-
01:11:57 You bet we can't live like that.
01:11:59 No, if only.
01:12:01 If the PCB got vastly more successful.
01:12:03 I mean, I just think about like those fucking guys,
01:12:05 like Come Town and those other podcasts
01:12:07 that make literally too much money.
01:12:09 It's not right, it's wrong.
01:12:12 Imagine if we made like that much money.
01:12:14 We could just live our lives being like,
01:12:16 eh, put it on the PCP account.
01:12:18 Pretty much, pretty much.
01:12:20 Do you know who I am?
01:12:21 I'm on the PCP.
01:12:23 It's free.
01:12:26 It's great.
01:12:27 Okay, I guess the only different thing that I have here
01:12:32 is that I shave all my fucking leg hair off.
01:12:36 Oh, God, that did happen.
01:12:39 Oh, I shave all the hairs off my hands and legs
01:12:42 and arms and feet.
01:12:45 I've talked about doing that, but give was the one
01:12:46 who actually committed.
01:12:47 Punish Gibb and take.
01:12:49 Jesus Christ.
01:12:50 It was extremely gay, but I do think
01:12:53 that having super smooth legs is very based
01:12:55 for like five minutes.
01:12:57 Sure, sure.
01:12:58 Because it feels like, whoa, these are on my legs
01:13:02 and you touch them and you're like, that's not my leg.
01:13:04 That was fun.
01:13:05 It was interesting.
01:13:06 Which lecture was it, Gibb, that you,
01:13:08 because you were in a lot of pain.
01:13:09 It was my lecture.
01:13:10 Yeah, it was the first lecture.
01:13:11 Tom's right, okay, okay.
01:13:13 We're like, because we, I shaved my legs
01:13:16 and then I didn't know how to do it,
01:13:19 like I did it wrong.
01:13:20 I didn't realize I was giving myself
01:13:21 like thousands of tiny microscopic cuts.
01:13:24 I didn't see any blood.
01:13:25 I mentioned that to Michelle later,
01:13:27 and she was like, it should not hurt that much.
01:13:29 That's not good, that that's.
01:13:31 I was using like dull, like 7-Eleven razors.
01:13:35 And I was scraping it all off.
01:13:38 And the day after, well, I do it during the night,
01:13:42 and then the day after, we did the OVA,
01:13:45 which involved running around on the beach,
01:13:47 rolling around in the sand,
01:13:49 getting in the salty seawater,
01:13:51 which fucked them up quite a bit.
01:13:53 Low.
01:13:53 And like that night, I think,
01:13:57 when did we do the first lecture?
01:13:58 Was it the day after that?
01:14:00 The third or the fourth day?
01:14:02 I think it's the fourth day.
01:14:04 Yeah, yeah, yeah, Monday the night.
01:14:05 The day after, I believe.
01:14:08 They were in extreme pain.
01:14:09 I was in constant pain the entire day,
01:14:11 and I hated life.
01:14:13 I regretted everything.
01:14:16 It sucked.
01:14:17 Yeah.
01:14:17 Don't do it if you don't know what you're doing.
01:14:21 But on the other hand, pretty fucking base.
01:14:24 Just fuck it, man.
01:14:24 Just do it.
01:14:25 Pretty base, though.
01:14:26 Yeah, pretty base.
01:14:27 It was pretty base to do it.
01:14:29 I've never felt so smooth.
01:14:31 Indeed.
01:14:31 Indeed.
01:14:32 You're a hairy man.
01:14:33 Gross, dude.
01:14:33 I mean, I am a hairy man.
01:14:34 I have shaved my body before,
01:14:37 and yeah, it feels terrible.
01:14:39 No, it doesn't.
01:14:41 And it lasts like a day.
01:14:42 I feel like once, like for a few minutes,
01:14:45 it feels like really good.
01:14:47 And then when the pain sets in, then it feels terrible.
01:14:50 But when the hairs come back, they stop poking through.
01:14:52 Well, when I shaved my torso now,
01:14:56 and then until the hair starts moving around,
01:15:01 I feel my shirt on my skin in a way that is very distracting.
01:15:05 It's not painful exactly, but it sucks.
01:15:09 I don't have a lot of chest hair,
01:15:10 so that's not a big thing for me.
01:15:11 But once in a while, I will shave my armpits
01:15:14 just because I'm like, well, this is too long.
01:15:15 Let's just start over again.
01:15:16 I have done that before, and it also feels bad.
01:15:18 And I hate it.
01:15:19 It fucking hurts, especially when it grows back a little bit.
01:15:22 And then there's prickles,
01:15:23 and then you're stabbing yourself with your armpits.
01:15:25 The armpits are the least bad part, I feel.
01:15:29 You think so?
01:15:30 Yeah, I don't know why.
01:15:32 Well, maybe compared to other stuff.
01:15:34 I mean, the armpits are fucking sensitive.
01:15:37 I guess they are.
01:15:39 Maybe I'm hard as nails.
01:15:41 Maybe I'm the tough man.
01:15:42 Like, I didn't pass out when I should have.
01:15:45 Hard as nails.
01:15:46 It ain't hard to tell.
01:15:47 I sat through that whole Animorphs lecture.
01:15:50 I learned about yirks.
01:15:52 Yeah.
01:15:53 Watch the fucking Animorphs lecture.
01:15:55 There's a bunch of people.
01:15:55 Go watch it.
01:15:56 The reaction's been incredibly positive,
01:15:58 which I'm happy about.
01:15:59 K.A. Applegate approved.
01:16:00 Because I was like sweating balls sitting there
01:16:04 before we started being like, this could suck.
01:16:07 Yeah, yeah.
01:16:08 But no, it was good.
01:16:10 Yeah, I promise you.
01:16:11 And now the people are getting to voice their agreement.
01:16:14 And it's great.
01:16:15 I dig it.
01:16:17 My favorite thing by far was this shit about zero space.
01:16:20 I'm so happy that they came up with their own system
01:16:23 of fast and light travel.
01:16:24 It's at 11 K views already.
01:16:26 After what, like two days?
01:16:28 One day?
01:16:30 Less than two days.
01:16:31 And the lectures are slow burners.
01:16:33 They retain serious viewership long-term.
01:16:36 And they just spread like a virus.
01:16:39 They got big aroma.
01:16:40 I really don't know how much the risk of lecture.
01:16:42 Because the content of it is like, it's pretty good.
01:16:45 It's not like the best it could be.
01:16:47 I feel like I fell short in a few areas.
01:16:49 Yeah, they never are.
01:16:50 But the subject matter, there's a lot of homestucks out there.
01:16:56 And Vriska is a very contentious character.
01:16:58 I title it like the best character in Homestuck.
01:17:00 Indeed.
01:17:01 Vriska 101.
01:17:02 That makes me mad and angry.
01:17:03 Are people going to jump on there and say, no.
01:17:07 No, it's not true, Vriska Stucks.
01:17:09 Is that going to bolster the views?
01:17:10 I hope it does.
01:17:12 Tom, when your lecture came out, I thought, oh boy,
01:17:15 someone should post this on Reddit r slash animorphs.
01:17:18 But then I was like, there's no way that exists.
01:17:20 Or if it does, there's like five people on.
01:17:22 Right.
01:17:23 But you should definitely post the Vriska one on r slash Homestuck.
01:17:28 Oh, I might get destroyed.
01:17:29 But yes, I should.
01:17:31 No.
01:17:32 Wait, is it like a universal thing
01:17:34 that you're not supposed to self promote on Reddit
01:17:36 or is it only some subreddits?
01:17:38 I assume it's, well, maybe not.
01:17:41 Not every subreddit enforces that,
01:17:43 but it is like general practice that like,
01:17:45 unless it says otherwise, you're not supposed to self promote.
01:17:48 Well, I mean, I'll fucking post it for you if you want me to.
01:17:51 Yeah, I mean, I think it's fine on the Homestuck Reddit.
01:17:54 The reason I have reservations is that Homestuck fans,
01:17:58 like vast majority, are people who are still into Homestuck.
01:18:02 Ergo people who are stupid.
01:18:05 And they don't understand things like act six wasn't as good
01:18:09 as the rest of Homestuck.
01:18:10 Vriska did nothing wrong.
01:18:11 They believe that all of the bad things.
01:18:14 And they are the, you know,
01:18:17 so those are the people on the Reddit
01:18:18 and they will come to the video and they will say no.
01:18:20 It would be like talking about,
01:18:22 it's like when the Brony lecture is going to drop.
01:18:24 And, you know.
01:18:26 Oh yeah.
01:18:26 I'm so excited for that.
01:18:28 I forgot about that.
01:18:28 Imagine all the comments that'll be in there.
01:18:30 Dude.
01:18:31 It'll be sick.
01:18:32 I would love, I would love fucking.
01:18:34 For the response to that one.
01:18:36 I'm pretty excited.
01:18:36 Yeah, I would imagine.
01:18:38 Imagine if FNGR does a huge big thing.
01:18:42 Imagine if anyone, like a misanthropony does all the little action to it.
01:18:46 FNGR is such a fucking piece of shit that like,
01:18:48 it would be so funny if,
01:18:50 like if he tried to do anything about it,
01:18:52 it would just like be,
01:18:55 it would just make it even cooler that like,
01:18:57 oh, FNGR went and like,
01:18:59 he said all this shit in response to this video.
01:19:01 It's like, that just means we're good.
01:19:03 Like if it makes FNGR mad,
01:19:04 that just shows you that you're on the right path
01:19:06 and you, and you should continue.
01:19:08 Shout out to my boy FNGR.
01:19:10 Shout out to FNGR.
01:19:10 Face to this very day.
01:19:12 Love you, buddy.
01:19:17 What was I saying?
01:19:18 Oh, hey, did, did anyone ever post like,
01:19:23 was there ever like a thread on Reddit about arm retrieval?
01:19:26 Did that ever get posted there?
01:19:28 I don't know.
01:19:28 Did like, did, did, did R slash Homestuck have any response to arm retrieval?
01:19:33 Strong disavowal, I'm sure.
01:19:34 I feel like if, if it's as you say,
01:19:36 and the people on R slash Homestuck,
01:19:38 and I'm sure that you're right,
01:19:39 that they're all like, no, no, X6 wasn't that bad.
01:19:41 No, no, no, the ending was good.
01:19:43 No, they probably hated it.
01:19:46 Not all of them, I think it was posted there a little bit.
01:19:49 A few people from who found arm retrieval via the Reddit
01:19:54 are now like in RFCK.
01:19:56 I think Shaddock was one of those people.
01:19:58 Sick.
01:19:58 He was a Homestuck man.
01:20:00 He found arm retrieval and he was based, so he liked it.
01:20:04 But it didn't get a lot of traction on the Reddit, I don't think.
01:20:08 Speaking of Shaddock, I am having him, her,
01:20:12 I don't know what Shaddock is.
01:20:14 Sure, it's a him.
01:20:14 I only know Shaddock has a gray blob from...
01:20:18 Yeah, yeah.
01:20:18 But I'm having Shaddock make a little thing for,
01:20:21 for, for, I'm commissioning for a little,
01:20:23 a little, little treat to slap into the fucking CWC 102 lecture.
01:20:29 It's gonna be fun.
01:20:29 Of what medium?
01:20:30 It's gonna be...
01:20:31 Are they, are they an art person?
01:20:32 Animator.
01:20:33 Animator.
01:20:34 Oh, okay, okay, cool.
01:20:35 This is gonna be a little funny, a little funny thing.
01:20:37 They did the very first arm retrieval animated,
01:20:39 if you remember that.
01:20:40 Oh, that's right.
01:20:41 Okay, right, right, I remember now.
01:20:44 Based.
01:20:45 It's based.
01:20:45 It's based, dude.
01:20:47 It's fucking based, dude.
01:20:49 How long do you think the based cringe meme is going to subsist post-radcon?
01:20:54 I thought it was dead.
01:20:54 Because we're all still at least a year.
01:20:56 At least a year.
01:20:57 At least a year.
01:20:58 I, I think, I thought it was like dead a few,
01:21:01 like a day or two ago,
01:21:02 but now that I'm in this call and I'm hearing it,
01:21:04 I'm just like, yeah, you know, based on cringe is still based.
01:21:07 Well, I know that it's not dead,
01:21:08 because I am still saying it constantly in my real life.
01:21:14 And that's, that's all it takes.
01:21:16 I'm just, I'm gonna carry the torch to my grave.
01:21:19 I wanna challenge someone to make images
01:21:21 that we can use as emotes in the PCP Discord server
01:21:24 that are based on cringe,
01:21:26 that we can then upvote and, you know,
01:21:28 make, let's keep this thing going.
01:21:30 There's no, they don't look like anything.
01:21:33 Well, just, yeah, well, I use some artistic ingenuity folks
01:21:37 and, you know, just sign on the look here.
01:21:39 I'm, I'm, I'm remembering, uh, uh,
01:21:41 Milhouse's dad playing, uh, uh, uh, uh,
01:21:46 Oh God, what's that game where you draw?
01:21:48 Pictionary?
01:21:49 Not Pictionary.
01:21:50 Is it Pictionary?
01:21:51 Yeah, playing Pictionary and he draws the squiggle.
01:21:53 It's dignity!
01:21:55 Oh, yeah.
01:21:56 Oh, exactly, that's what I hope to see.
01:22:05 Man, what the fuck?
01:22:06 Milhouse's dad is the worst guy.
01:22:08 No, he's the best guy.
01:22:09 What the fuck?
01:22:10 Kirk Van Houten.
01:22:11 Oh, dude, next Radcon 5, Kirk Van Houten lecture.
01:22:15 Oh, definitely.
01:22:17 That's a meep lore.
01:22:18 That's a, that's a risketeer lecture in terms of scale.
01:22:22 You know, I, I, I'm the subject of curse here.
01:22:23 Single character lectures.
01:22:25 Yeah.
01:22:25 Uh, fucking, yeah, be a risketeer, risketeer, ask.
01:22:28 Um, so in that episode, he's like really mean to his wife
01:22:32 and he's like yelling at her and like taking her for granted and stuff.
01:22:34 I'm just curious, in any of his appearances,
01:22:37 if he in fact had appearances before that episode,
01:22:39 was that like something like he was shown to be like aggressive or rude to his wife?
01:22:44 Or was that like kind of made for that video, for that episode?
01:22:47 Was, was he, I mean, was he like the bad guy?
01:22:52 I think it's, I mean, if I remember that episode,
01:22:55 like that, he was being very rude and mean to his wife.
01:22:57 I kind of just remember that like they just are angry at each other like the whole time
01:23:02 and then they get divorced.
01:23:03 Historically or just in that episode?
01:23:05 Just in that, just in that episode.
01:23:08 They were like just like normal parents, I think before that.
01:23:11 I think that's true.
01:23:12 There's, there's the one where in the magic eight ball episode,
01:23:16 when Bart and Milhouse are like beating the crap out of each other,
01:23:19 they come out and the mom is like,
01:23:23 Milhouse is out of bed and full of beans.
01:23:26 And it's like, it's a miracle and they just leave.
01:23:29 That seemed like a pretty happy family at that time.
01:23:32 They were doing good.
01:23:34 Wait, wait, why was he full of beans?
01:23:36 What did that mean?
01:23:37 It was because he had in that episode.
01:23:39 In that episode.
01:23:41 Yeah, he got broken up with by the girl and he was like in bed and he was depressed.
01:23:45 And then he found out that Bart did it.
01:23:47 And he was killing Bart at that very moment.
01:23:49 He like he left.
01:23:50 He just started strangling Bart and kicking his ass.
01:23:53 And they're like, oh yeah, he's back.
01:23:55 Milhouse is back, baby.
01:23:56 I remember that.
01:23:57 Oh, that was great.
01:23:58 That was fantastic.
01:24:01 And ironically, the Simpsons is so old now,
01:24:03 you could do a lecture on the Simpsons
01:24:05 because so many new people don't get into it.
01:24:08 The lecture on the Simpsons would be,
01:24:11 there's way more of the Simpsons to talk about
01:24:13 than there is of like Homestuck.
01:24:15 It would have to be a very specific focus on like.
01:24:18 I mean, you would have to be.
01:24:21 I mean, do you guys know that?
01:24:22 Fucking Hans Molman lecture.
01:24:23 Yeah, yeah.
01:24:24 Do you guys know the channel The Real Gyms?
01:24:27 I think you've talked about it before.
01:24:28 Yeah, The Real Gyms, he not like lectures, but he does like
01:24:33 YouTube videos where he'll like spot like a character
01:24:36 and talk about like their entire history throughout like the show.
01:24:40 What's like the length of one of those?
01:24:41 Just out of curiosity.
01:24:42 Maybe like 20 minutes or something.
01:24:44 Yeah, okay, okay.
01:24:45 So you got to keep it limited scope.
01:24:46 He did one on Hans Molman.
01:24:47 He did an Edna Krabapal.
01:24:49 I don't think there's one on Kirk Van Houten,
01:24:52 but there might be.
01:24:52 There should be.
01:24:53 Let me find out.
01:24:54 Let me find out.
01:24:56 Why do we start talking about the Simpsons?
01:24:58 I have no idea.
01:25:00 I don't remember.
01:25:00 Because it's a great show.
01:25:01 Because it's a good show and everyone who didn't watch it
01:25:05 missed out, didn't have a child.
01:25:06 They're fucking Zoomers don't know back in the day.
01:25:09 It's still going, right?
01:25:10 They could watch it today.
01:25:12 Yeah, but it's not good now.
01:25:14 It's passed us from him.
01:25:15 Yeah, it's not relevant.
01:25:20 One day, every single person who worked on the first
01:25:22 series season of The Simpsons will be dead,
01:25:24 but The Simpsons will be alive.
01:25:28 No, there is no Kirk Van Houten episode.
01:25:31 Update your shit, bro.
01:25:33 We need it.
01:25:34 Real gyms.
01:25:38 Okay.
01:25:39 Well, hey, that said, how about voicemails?
01:25:41 I got them right here.
01:25:42 I'm ready to go.
01:25:42 I guess we might as well move on to voicemails.
01:25:46 Excellent.
01:25:47 I've got a selection that will titillate the senses.
01:25:50 I've no doubt.
01:25:51 So everybody, of course, you know,
01:25:53 speak pipe link down below, click on it,
01:25:55 leave voicemails there, et cetera, et cetera.
01:25:58 Now, of note, it's been like Ben said at the beginning.
01:26:01 It's been like three weeks since we've had a real episode
01:26:03 where we can answer voicemails.
01:26:05 Now, there aren't that many.
01:26:06 I think I have seven total.
01:26:08 There's more like six, because there's like some
01:26:09 two part of stuff here.
01:26:10 But let's let's take a look.
01:26:13 Here we go.
01:26:13 First one is from Clyde Caliber.
01:26:17 And let's see what he has in store for us and go.
01:26:21 Best date idea you've ever heard in your entire life.
01:26:24 Three, two, one, go.
01:26:26 Take her to Best Buy.
01:26:28 Go to the back where the blue rays are.
01:26:32 Tell her to pick out whichever one she likes best.
01:26:34 It doesn't matter which one it fucking is.
01:26:36 You immediately go and buy it.
01:26:38 If she's confused as to why
01:26:40 and she doesn't want it for some reason,
01:26:42 just tell her it's for your dad.
01:26:46 Wow.
01:26:47 That's his suggestion.
01:26:48 You really know how to pick them, Naean.
01:26:52 I liked it.
01:26:53 What's your favorite date idea, guys?
01:26:55 Jokes on him.
01:26:56 Best Buy literally today announced
01:26:58 that they're closing all of their stores.
01:27:00 You can't go inside them.
01:27:01 All stores?
01:27:02 Wait, is this a corona thing?
01:27:03 For the pandemic.
01:27:04 For the pandemic thing.
01:27:05 But you can only do curbside pickup now.
01:27:09 So your plan is foiled already.
01:27:12 I prefer a curb stomp pickup
01:27:14 where they just kill me on the curb when I pull up.
01:27:17 Maybe they can do that.
01:27:19 When I go to Whole Foods,
01:27:21 my local Whole Foods is connected to a Starbucks
01:27:23 and it's funny.
01:27:24 I see people wait outside the Starbucks
01:27:27 and the barista comes out the door,
01:27:29 asks what they want,
01:27:30 and then brings it outside to them.
01:27:33 Fascinating.
01:27:33 It's very weird.
01:27:35 Best date idea?
01:27:36 I don't fucking know.
01:27:40 Hey, hey, you know what is funny?
01:27:42 Why would you ask me that?
01:27:43 Yeah, Ben has no ideas.
01:27:44 Clearly.
01:27:45 My favorite date idea is self-isolation.
01:27:48 Just stay indoors and you don't talk late.
01:27:50 Yeah, Skype with your GF.
01:27:54 Great idea.
01:27:55 Okay, well, you know what?
01:27:56 It doesn't matter.
01:27:57 One of the reasons that I wanted to play this one
01:27:58 was to remind me that I just watched
01:28:02 the Steven Universe episodes.
01:28:04 There's so...
01:28:05 Oh, God, I haven't watched any of those.
01:28:08 They're not all bad.
01:28:09 I think they're 16 out now.
01:28:11 I never even finished original Steven Universe.
01:28:14 You should.
01:28:16 I didn't watch the last five episodes.
01:28:18 So you haven't seen the movie yet?
01:28:21 I did see the movie.
01:28:22 Oh, okay, good.
01:28:22 That's better than the episodes.
01:28:23 Fuck the episodes.
01:28:24 Although there is some good stuff there.
01:28:25 Okay, whatever.
01:28:27 I was going to say that in the last...
01:28:30 Actually, of note, this Friday,
01:28:32 in fact, the day you're listening to this
01:28:33 at like 7 p.m., the final two episodes,
01:28:37 so there's like four of the mini half-episode episodes.
01:28:40 That's how Steven Universe works.
01:28:41 The final four Steven Universe episodes
01:28:43 are airing like two day,
01:28:45 and the series is ending forever.
01:28:47 Steven Universe's future is over
01:28:49 as of a couple hours after you're hearing this.
01:28:52 So that's interesting.
01:28:53 I guess the movie in a season afterwards
01:28:57 never really caught on,
01:28:58 because I completely forgot immediately
01:29:01 that it was a thing.
01:29:02 I don't blame you.
01:29:03 After I heard that it was a thing.
01:29:04 Michelle's been watching and been reminding me,
01:29:06 and I finally caught up with her yesterday.
01:29:07 And as always, I still like Steven Universe a lot,
01:29:10 though I always make fun of it because there's some dumb shit.
01:29:12 Okay, but there was one...
01:29:13 What's the general plot?
01:29:15 What does Steven...
01:29:16 Oh, sure, sure.
01:29:17 I think...
01:29:17 In summary, so like Steven Universe happened,
01:29:20 then they saved the world,
01:29:22 then the movie happens,
01:29:23 and they're dealing with like fallout of,
01:29:25 you know, like some fucked up shit that's still going on.
01:29:27 Now that that's done,
01:29:28 it's just a little bit after that,
01:29:30 and basically it's just the story of Steven
01:29:33 having PTSD from his experiences,
01:29:35 and like acclimating back to being like a normal teenager.
01:29:38 I think you maybe explained that somewhere before.
01:29:40 Yeah, I mean, it's a little hard to see Steven
01:29:44 be such a whiny baby when he used to be such a Chad child,
01:29:48 but you know, it's understandable.
01:29:49 Doesn't he have like PTSD now?
01:29:52 Huh? Say what you said.
01:29:53 Yeah, yeah.
01:29:54 What?
01:29:54 That's pretty much the issue.
01:29:55 That's almost exactly what they're implying,
01:29:57 that yeah, he's got like PTSD,
01:29:59 and it makes him all fucked up in some ways.
01:30:01 He's got like weird...
01:30:02 Everyone's like going off to college
01:30:04 and like doing their own thing,
01:30:05 and Steven doesn't know what he wants to do,
01:30:06 and he feels really lonely and scared,
01:30:08 because he's missing people that he loved and stuff.
01:30:11 But...
01:30:12 Post-traumatic Steven disorder.
01:30:14 The reason that I mention it is because,
01:30:16 okay, here's a spoiler of an event that happens.
01:30:18 I won't tell you how it goes.
01:30:20 Okay, I have to tell you how it goes
01:30:21 for the sake of this event,
01:30:23 but Steven, like I said,
01:30:25 he's feeling really lonely,
01:30:26 and Connie is going to go off to college,
01:30:28 and Steven doesn't know what he wants to do.
01:30:30 So he talks to like Ruby and Sapphire separately,
01:30:33 because they're doing their own stuff,
01:30:35 and they both suggest that Steven propose to Connie.
01:30:40 These two have never been on a date.
01:30:42 What?
01:30:42 Connie gave him a kiss on the cheek once in the movie
01:30:46 to propose marriage.
01:30:47 They're Jim.
01:30:48 Is the proposal.
01:30:48 They're Jim fucked before.
01:30:52 Actually, Garnet later says like, yeah.
01:30:53 Are you trying to tell...
01:30:54 Nate.
01:30:55 What?
01:30:55 Are you trying to tell me
01:30:56 that you don't think Steven and Connie
01:30:58 like know each other well enough?
01:31:00 Ben, they have not been on one date ever.
01:31:02 You think marriage is the appropriate step there?
01:31:04 Are you fucking insane?
01:31:05 They've spent like three seasons together.
01:31:07 They don't need to go on a date.
01:31:08 They fucking spent a huge amount of time together.
01:31:10 Well, I guess it's a good thing
01:31:11 that the narrative literally agrees with me and not you,
01:31:14 because Connie says, obviously, no,
01:31:15 I'm not going to do that.
01:31:16 So there you go.
01:31:17 Why did...
01:31:18 Well, look, I'm not saying they should...
01:31:19 No, you fucking idiot.
01:31:21 I didn't say yes, they should get married.
01:31:22 I said it doesn't matter
01:31:23 that they haven't been on a formal date.
01:31:26 Well, okay, I mean,
01:31:27 I don't think that's how romance works,
01:31:28 so whatever.
01:31:29 Look, the point of it is...
01:31:30 What?
01:31:31 Ben, what is wrong with you?
01:31:33 No, it doesn't matter, Ben.
01:31:34 The point is that in this fucking retarded ass situation,
01:31:38 Steven sets out this like amazing spread.
01:31:41 It's an incredibly romantic scene,
01:31:42 and he like sings the song for Connie,
01:31:44 and Connie is visibly wooed
01:31:46 and would definitely fuck if pressed.
01:31:49 But instead of like doing anything romantic,
01:31:51 he just jumped straight to marry me.
01:31:54 And I just wanted to say,
01:31:55 everything about the way he did that was perfect,
01:31:58 except he had way too high of ambitions
01:32:01 for this one scene.
01:32:02 But it was like a really great romantic scene
01:32:04 that he just, for some reason,
01:32:05 in his weird asexual autistic brain
01:32:08 thought that marriage was the appropriate step to go to.
01:32:10 Aren't they like 16?
01:32:11 Yeah, yeah.
01:32:13 That's super weird.
01:32:14 How is she going to college at 16?
01:32:17 She's actually like a year younger
01:32:18 than Steven, I think, too.
01:32:20 So I don't know.
01:32:22 You tell me.
01:32:22 The fuck?
01:32:23 She's really smart.
01:32:24 Is this, I cannot imagine.
01:32:25 Is this played for laughs?
01:32:27 Um, okay, I mean.
01:32:28 The entirety of Steven Universe is played for laughs.
01:32:31 The setup is absolutely played for laughs,
01:32:33 but the emotional consequences of Connie saying no
01:32:36 is legitimately devastating to Steven.
01:32:39 Well, okay.
01:32:41 I guess that makes sense.
01:32:43 Yeah, yeah.
01:32:44 Hmm, I don't know.
01:32:45 I don't know if that was pretty good.
01:32:46 But I wanted to win.
01:32:47 I'm pretty excited for the finale of Steven Universe.
01:32:50 I'm looking forward to it.
01:32:51 I guess I'll get caught up.
01:32:52 But anyway, you should.
01:32:54 I mean, I'll do it.
01:32:54 The idea is that he needs to propose to her.
01:32:56 What, to like keep her from going away to college?
01:32:59 Oh, you know what?
01:33:00 He specifically proposes.
01:33:02 Yes, Ben, but even more than that,
01:33:03 he proposes to say like,
01:33:04 because he gets the idea from Ruby and Sapphire,
01:33:07 let's be Stevonnie forever.
01:33:10 Let's like do that.
01:33:12 Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
01:33:15 That's fucking weird.
01:33:16 Yeah, it's what you get for listening to Gens.
01:33:20 I mean, it's funny because Garnet herself says like Steven,
01:33:23 you listen to Ruby and Sapphire to like love-addled retards.
01:33:27 Listen to me, Garnet, because I'm smarter than them,
01:33:30 even though I am them.
01:33:31 I don't quite get it, but.
01:33:32 Garnet is that.
01:33:34 For this particular scene, she needed to not be,
01:33:37 so she wasn't.
01:33:38 And it was perfect.
01:33:39 Love that.
01:33:41 Yeah, I know, I know.
01:33:43 It's not perfect.
01:33:44 Next voicemail, Jesus Christ.
01:33:47 Okay, okay.
01:33:47 Oh, you're gonna love this.
01:33:48 This is from Virgin Rage is calling in.
01:33:52 Let's hear what she has to say.
01:33:53 Go.
01:33:54 I can't wait.
01:33:55 Oh, you're so nice, Jacks.
01:33:56 You're so sweet and kind and wonderful.
01:33:59 And oh, I love that new haircut you got.
01:34:01 Oh, you're so handsome and you're so funny
01:34:04 and so talented and nice and strong.
01:34:06 And you'll make a perfect boyfriend with it.
01:34:08 Oh, you're gonna make a perfect husband when you grow up.
01:34:13 You grow up.
01:34:14 Then I won't hit him.
01:34:15 You just fuck me over.
01:34:19 That's it.
01:34:20 Because they're lying to you, they don't actually mean it.
01:34:25 Hard to agree, I guess.
01:34:26 Hard to agree.
01:34:27 I think they mean it.
01:34:28 I'm gonna vote yes on that.
01:34:33 These women are gaslighting you and that is emotional abuse,
01:34:36 that they're not having sex with you.
01:34:38 Got to agree.
01:34:39 Got to agree.
01:34:41 I mean, imagine your whole day being told how handsome and cute you are
01:34:43 and none of the women are having sex with you.
01:34:46 Something's wrong.
01:34:46 Don't let them get away with it.
01:34:50 Make them pay.
01:34:51 Yeah, that's the only thing to do.
01:34:52 Because they get what they fucking deserve.
01:34:54 Make them pay.
01:34:54 Fuck it.
01:34:55 Make them pay.
01:34:58 I'm not telling you to do anything specific.
01:34:59 Just use your imagination.
01:35:00 Yeah, yeah, no, no.
01:35:01 Make them pay for your only fan's account.
01:35:07 That's the way, that's the way.
01:35:09 Okay, next one we've got Radcon Forever.
01:35:12 Okay, and take it away, go.
01:35:14 Bro, so like, what if you guys get stuck in your old Virginia place
01:35:18 because of the corona shit?
01:35:19 Like, what if, what if like,
01:35:20 great question and like, none of you guys can like, go anywhere?
01:35:23 You're stuck in Radcon Forever.
01:35:27 That's the joke.
01:35:27 Bye-bye.
01:35:29 Excellent.
01:35:30 I guess, I guess we would have just had to like,
01:35:32 crash at Digi and fix a house.
01:35:34 That's, it would have been the only thing to do, yeah.
01:35:37 Or, I mean, the alternative would be drain the Radcon fund on like,
01:35:41 getting a fucking hotel until the next time as we can leave.
01:35:44 I would have considered just like,
01:35:46 renting a car and driving home.
01:35:48 I mean, obviously, the only viable thing would have been
01:35:52 immediately kickstarting Radcon 5 and doing it.
01:35:56 Yeah, yeah.
01:35:57 Spend your precious money.
01:35:59 You don't have the ability to go to work anymore.
01:36:01 Spend your money on us.
01:36:02 Right, right.
01:36:03 Please.
01:36:04 Imagine, imagine if there had been like,
01:36:07 I mean, I can't imagine that they would have like,
01:36:09 said like, no traveling within the country.
01:36:12 But like, I can imagine a scenario in which like,
01:36:16 flights stop leaving the country.
01:36:18 Yeah.
01:36:19 And that would have been.
01:36:19 That's definitely possible.
01:36:21 It was the most vulnerable probably.
01:36:22 It would have been really funny if you were just stuck here for like,
01:36:27 a month maybe or something.
01:36:28 Years.
01:36:29 Lol.
01:36:29 I mean, on the one hand, it's, it would be pretty scary because,
01:36:36 I'm, you know, just like coronavirus, it's a pandemic.
01:36:39 I want to be, I don't know, in a place I'm used to the least.
01:36:43 A place where you can get healthcare that doesn't cost
01:36:46 $3,000 to get a coronavirus test.
01:36:48 Yeah, that's, that's also the thing.
01:36:50 But like, on the other hand, it would be pretty cool to have an excuse
01:36:54 to stay in America for an extended period of time.
01:36:57 Sure.
01:36:58 It's, it's not really a thing to like get a flight and that leaves
01:37:02 like a bunch of months later.
01:37:03 Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
01:37:04 Like you have to stay for a certain amount of time.
01:37:07 And then if you stay for too long, you're an illegal immigrant.
01:37:10 You got to get out.
01:37:11 You know, I got a good deal on me and Tom's plane tickets.
01:37:14 But it's hurt, like, I guess like the price of tickets drop precipitously
01:37:21 because of the pandemic.
01:37:22 So it actually would have cost less if I had waited till the last minute.
01:37:25 Ah, it's one of those things.
01:37:27 No way to predict.
01:37:28 Yeah, there was no way to know at the time, unfortunately.
01:37:30 Hey, you know, I just thought of something.
01:37:35 I realized that I'm so scared of flying.
01:37:40 I'm so afraid of it.
01:37:41 You said, you say you realized, was this not a thing earlier?
01:37:45 I was so uncomfortable being there,
01:37:48 watching you have like all but a panic attack while flying
01:37:52 and being completely confused as to what to do,
01:37:54 if anything, to comfort this poor man.
01:37:58 No, I mean, there was nothing you could.
01:38:01 It was just like a descent into just like madness
01:38:05 because like we're getting on the plane,
01:38:06 we're getting on the plane the first time.
01:38:08 I didn't used to be like this.
01:38:10 I didn't used to do.
01:38:12 You just have to understand this from my perspective
01:38:14 because like we're getting on the first flight
01:38:16 and we're walking down into the back of the plane
01:38:19 because we're in coach.
01:38:20 And like you just like are like still in generally good spirits.
01:38:24 And you admitted off like comment of like,
01:38:26 oh yeah, I'm not really a fan of flying.
01:38:28 And I didn't know how serious to take that.
01:38:29 And like you were hamming it up
01:38:31 because like we're walking past one of like the stewardess who's like,
01:38:33 hey, we're going to be okay, right?
01:38:35 And he's just like, yeah, we're going to be fine.
01:38:38 And I was like, oh, there's Ben having a good time,
01:38:40 riffing on the help.
01:38:42 How hilarious.
01:38:44 Not realizing he was deadly serious about this question.
01:38:47 My mask cracked.
01:38:48 My mask like progressively cracked.
01:38:50 I got more afraid with every flight.
01:38:53 I was worse on the second one
01:38:55 and worst on the third on the one home.
01:38:56 You'd think it would go the opposite way
01:38:58 because it proved to, you know, turn it okay.
01:39:01 I'm not kidding.
01:39:02 I spent like every night at Radcon like,
01:39:07 and it got worse as it went on.
01:39:08 I was like, I would like have trouble sleeping
01:39:12 because I would be thinking about,
01:39:13 oh God, I have to take another flight home.
01:39:15 I have to fly again.
01:39:18 Like it cost me sleep and it was upsetting.
01:39:21 And I don't know what's wrong with me.
01:39:24 This is like a new thing.
01:39:26 This is like, like I flew to Radcon three and did I like flying?
01:39:31 No, but I didn't like flight of Radcon three
01:39:33 because you lived in the boxing area.
01:39:36 No, you flew.
01:39:37 No, I lived in Georgia at the time.
01:39:39 Oh, that's right.
01:39:40 That was back in the day.
01:39:42 Yeah, and like I didn't, on the flight home,
01:39:46 I had like such a strong like fucking episode
01:39:49 that I had to like get out of my seat
01:39:52 and like fucking hustle to the front of the plane
01:39:54 and be and like accost the flight attendants
01:39:58 and be like, what is happening?
01:40:00 What are we doing?
01:40:01 Why, was there turbulence or something?
01:40:03 While you were in flight?
01:40:04 Yes.
01:40:04 There was no turbulence,
01:40:06 but Ben was just like constantly like looking out the windows
01:40:09 and being like, where are we?
01:40:10 I don't get it.
01:40:10 I don't understand what's going on.
01:40:13 And I'm just like, Ben, we're above the clouds
01:40:15 and it's nighttime.
01:40:16 That's why you can't see anything,
01:40:17 but like he was not having any of this shit.
01:40:20 I could see the clouds.
01:40:21 I could see that we were above the clouds,
01:40:23 but I kept feeling as though I had a constant feeling
01:40:27 like we were turning.
01:40:29 We weren't turning,
01:40:30 but I kept thinking that we were turning
01:40:32 and I was like, why are we turning?
01:40:33 Where are we going?
01:40:35 And then we changed altitude at some point
01:40:38 and I was like, why is this happening?
01:40:41 Why?
01:40:43 No, no, something's wrong, something's wrong.
01:40:45 And I had to go ask the flight attendants,
01:40:47 like, is this normal?
01:40:48 Is this normal?
01:40:49 And they were like, yes, this is normal.
01:40:50 And I'm like, okay.
01:40:52 And I sat down again.
01:40:54 And it was fucking based.
01:40:55 Did you have like, did you have like action movie like?
01:41:00 There was no screens or anything.
01:41:03 No.
01:41:03 There was, was it like, like intense music?
01:41:06 The first flight was better
01:41:08 because we had the screens and it showed our altitude.
01:41:10 So I could watch the screen and be like, okay,
01:41:12 I see where we are.
01:41:13 I see our altitude.
01:41:14 It's normal.
01:41:15 We're not like, we're not plummeting.
01:41:18 We're on track.
01:41:20 This is reasonable.
01:41:21 But the second two flights did not have those.
01:41:23 And I, you have no idea what's,
01:41:28 there's no frame of reference, what's going on.
01:41:30 I don't know if every flight has this,
01:41:32 but I, I've discovered recently that when,
01:41:34 when planes don't have the screens that show a thing,
01:41:36 a lot of them do have like a Wi-Fi connection thing
01:41:39 that you can use to actually show the progress
01:41:42 and all those stats on your phone if you connect to that.
01:41:46 So perhaps that would be a helpful thing.
01:41:47 You could usually go to pay for that though.
01:41:50 And that's, I mean, it's been freed.
01:41:51 I mean, my flight had free Wi-Fi.
01:41:52 I've never had a free thing.
01:41:54 My, my flight had free Wi-Fi.
01:41:57 Anyway, I just thought I'd mentioned that.
01:41:59 It was a weird and unpleasant thing that happened.
01:42:01 And I don't like it.
01:42:02 I hope that gets better.
01:42:05 Yeah.
01:42:06 I know that statistically flying is the safest way to travel,
01:42:09 but it is also the scariest.
01:42:11 You know, I mean, you're the least likely to die.
01:42:14 Sure.
01:42:14 But, but I constantly think I am going to die.
01:42:18 I understand that.
01:42:18 You're the most likely to shit yourself.
01:42:20 Maybe you're more comfortable like, I mean,
01:42:22 imagine Radcon 5, let's just say theoretically,
01:42:24 it's in Virginia Beach again or whatever.
01:42:26 You could maybe take a train.
01:42:28 It would take longer, but you know.
01:42:29 It was so bad that I'm considering just never flying again
01:42:33 and taking the train just to avoid feeling that way.
01:42:37 I don't really see any downsides.
01:42:39 But then like, even though it would probably be more expensive
01:42:43 and take like 10 times as long.
01:42:45 Possible.
01:42:45 Smash cut to you being on the train.
01:42:47 You look at the window and it's dark and you're like,
01:42:49 wait, where are we?
01:42:50 Where are we going?
01:42:51 Oh, and the plane is plummeting towards the train
01:42:54 directly at Ben's window.
01:42:55 What, what, why is our altitude changed?
01:42:57 Where are we going?
01:42:58 Like, like the, like the shitty trains,
01:43:01 like the commuter rail sucks.
01:43:03 But like, like a good train, like a cellar or whatever,
01:43:07 is like, those are a joy.
01:43:08 Those are just a fucking, like a cross-country train
01:43:11 or just a treat.
01:43:13 They're just a treat.
01:43:13 Ben, your insistence on taking the train
01:43:16 reminds me a lot of one Joseph Biden
01:43:19 talking about investing in rail.
01:43:21 He loves, that's the one thing.
01:43:22 That's the one thing that I got it.
01:43:24 You got a hand, it's just like ISIS.
01:43:26 You do not have that.
01:43:27 Biden, you got, you got a handed to him.
01:43:29 He's a big fan of rail and so am I.
01:43:33 Fair enough.
01:43:33 Good for him.
01:43:34 And so is ISIS.
01:43:35 My hashtag, my president.
01:43:37 All right, let's go on to our next voicemail here
01:43:40 from an individual named Corn.
01:43:43 All right, Corn, take it away.
01:43:45 Hey, PCP, y'all better stay inside
01:43:48 and be practicing that social distancing.
01:43:51 Because if not, you're all fucked.
01:43:54 But anyway, my question is,
01:43:57 do y'all have any like media you'd recommend
01:43:59 people going through while they're stuck
01:44:02 holed up inside?
01:44:04 Like YouTube videos, TV shows,
01:44:06 Vidya, anything that you'd just like recommend
01:44:08 for like coming to Mumps?
01:44:10 Is that it?
01:44:11 Yeah.
01:44:13 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:44:14 Got it, quarantine media recommendations.
01:44:16 Got it.
01:44:16 End of, end of, end of voicemail.
01:44:18 Y'all better be social distancing.
01:44:19 I have a bunch of things that I like.
01:44:22 Here, I'll tell you what I really long
01:44:27 final fantasy, let's play, or speed runs from like a.
01:44:31 Just play the game.
01:44:33 No, it's gay.
01:44:34 No, like, like speed runs of like final fantasy,
01:44:38 seven, eight, nine, six, seven, eight, nine from,
01:44:40 from like GDQ.
01:44:41 You learn a lot watching speed runs that you won't get
01:44:43 just playing through anyway.
01:44:44 Yeah, not every speed run is interesting,
01:44:47 but the final, the really long final fantasy ones,
01:44:50 I can't get enough.
01:44:51 Bro, I was just, I'm just gonna, I said this the other day,
01:44:53 but I was just watching a speed run of Chrono Trigger.
01:44:56 It just felt good to just look at that game.
01:44:58 Oh, God.
01:44:58 Did you watch the one by Puexel from like 2016 or something?
01:45:03 The one, I remember, the Chrono Trigger one,
01:45:06 it was like the final game of like some AGDQ.
01:45:10 I think it was that.
01:45:10 And like, at the end, like they passed $3 million,
01:45:12 and it's like, the crowd goes fucking crazy.
01:45:16 It was great.
01:45:17 I love it, because they did all the end game quests and stuff.
01:45:20 Oh, it was satisfying, you shit.
01:45:21 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:45:22 Good shit.
01:45:23 My other recommendation would be.
01:45:25 Remember when Square Enix was good?
01:45:26 Ah, kill me.
01:45:27 I'm sorry, go on.
01:45:28 No.
01:45:30 The fucking Yogg's cast, Shadow of Israel,
01:45:38 I haven't watched it in a while,
01:45:39 but I watched it like maybe like six or seven years ago.
01:45:42 And when I found it, I thought it was like the coolest thing ever.
01:45:45 It's a really long Let's Play series,
01:45:47 but it really goes places you don't expect it to go.
01:45:50 I would, if you've never watched, I don't know,
01:45:54 I feel like Yogg's cast isn't that relevant anymore,
01:45:56 but like, I don't know, Shadow of Israel
01:45:59 was a very cool Minecraft series that is not.
01:46:03 Oh man, did all of those guys get me tooed?
01:46:04 Can I ethically consume this content?
01:46:07 I don't know, did he?
01:46:08 Is that true?
01:46:09 I think so.
01:46:10 I don't really know.
01:46:12 I disavow that I said that.
01:46:13 I don't know.
01:46:14 I don't know, whatever.
01:46:15 Yeah, it doesn't matter.
01:46:17 Give it a shot.
01:46:18 Have I talked about it and how it's like,
01:46:21 you think it's just...
01:46:23 You have talked about it, yeah.
01:46:24 You think they're just playing Minecraft,
01:46:26 but then like some weird shit starts to happen
01:46:29 and like suddenly there's like this whole narrative
01:46:32 that emerges and it's cool, man.
01:46:34 I guess I've kind of spoiled that reveal
01:46:37 just by talking about it, but like, it's cool, man.
01:46:40 People need to know the hook anyway.
01:46:42 Yeah.
01:46:43 So there you go.
01:46:45 Okay, give Tom, you want to suggest something?
01:46:47 I got a few.
01:46:49 Animorphs, obviously.
01:46:50 Fucking based.
01:46:52 Read that.
01:46:52 That's the time.
01:46:54 All the...
01:46:55 It's all like PDFs are available for free, right?
01:46:57 They're all available for free.
01:46:59 How do I open PDF?
01:47:01 But how do I open PDF?
01:47:02 Exactly, we're trapped here.
01:47:05 Listen, Jack.
01:47:07 Actually, speaking of Jack...
01:47:08 Hey man, hey Jack.
01:47:10 How do I open PDF?
01:47:12 You're a dang, you're a dang junkyard pole cat.
01:47:15 Oh my god.
01:47:16 The second thing I'm going to recommend
01:47:18 is Tales from the Gas Station,
01:47:19 which is a series starring character named Jack.
01:47:23 I thought you were going to go with Metal Gear Rising Revengeance
01:47:26 because there's a Jack in that as well.
01:47:28 There is a Jack in that as well.
01:47:30 Jack is a common name.
01:47:31 I don't know if you're aware,
01:47:33 but there are many Jacks throughout all of the media.
01:47:34 I don't know if he claimed that being in stock.
01:47:36 That was fucked up.
01:47:37 Yeah, yeah.
01:47:40 Jacks had a long and storied adventure
01:47:42 all throughout the years.
01:47:44 But yeah, no, Tales from the Gas Station's great.
01:47:46 If you like creepypasta kind of story,
01:47:49 but it's humorous and tongue-in-cheek.
01:47:52 It kind of pokes fun at the genre.
01:47:54 It's pretty great.
01:47:55 I love it, 10 out of 10.
01:47:56 Let's give people, since this is a practical question
01:47:58 of all this quarantine,
01:47:59 do you know where they can find it?
01:48:00 Where it's available?
01:48:02 You can, it's on No Sleep, on Reddit.
01:48:05 But if you prefer listening to it,
01:48:07 Mr. Creepypasta does a narration of it on YouTube.
01:48:09 And it's very well done.
01:48:11 That's how I listen to it.
01:48:12 I highly recommend it.
01:48:13 And if you really enjoy it,
01:48:15 Jack, Gas Station Jack,
01:48:17 the guy who writes the stories,
01:48:18 also has two novelizations
01:48:20 that expand upon the story available on Amazon.
01:48:24 I have both of them in hardback.
01:48:25 They're very good.
01:48:26 Cool, cool.
01:48:26 And the last thing I was going to recommend
01:48:29 is, I don't remember.
01:48:31 So I'm just going to say those two.
01:48:32 Sure.
01:48:33 All right, Gabe, what do you recommend?
01:48:36 Go to Gibb and Take.Site and read Bale, Jaype,
01:48:39 and the Lord of Ghosts comic.
01:48:41 Those are base.
01:48:42 Those are good.
01:48:42 Aside from that, I guess most people probably have
01:48:49 a long list of things
01:48:50 that they've been meaning to get around to.
01:48:52 Just do one of those.
01:48:53 Yeah, check your back.
01:48:54 I would probably, if I have, I mean,
01:48:59 I can work on the internet,
01:49:00 so I have no real excuse to not work.
01:49:03 But if I'm unable to do anything,
01:49:06 if I'm unable to move,
01:49:07 I'm going to try and figure out
01:49:08 how to watch all of Star Trek,
01:49:10 the next generation of the meaning to get around to that.
01:49:13 Queen.
01:49:13 That's what I'm talking about.
01:49:14 I should do that as well.
01:49:16 That's a big one.
01:49:17 And yeah, big old things
01:49:19 that you don't have the time
01:49:21 to usually get around to.
01:49:22 Smart.
01:49:23 Watch every video by Thought Slime.
01:49:26 Listen to Chappo, Trap House.
01:49:28 Get radicalized.
01:49:29 Now's the time.
01:49:30 It's never been a better time to see
01:49:32 in your house than right now.
01:49:34 It's never been more important, guys.
01:49:36 Oh, and play Pokemon Go.
01:49:38 Oh, you can't.
01:49:40 Oh, fuck.
01:49:41 Hey, I got a couple.
01:49:41 The last thing I was going to say
01:49:42 was a critical role.
01:49:45 If you want to just like literally do nothing,
01:49:47 like there's so much fucking critical role
01:49:50 to get caught up on.
01:49:51 There's like literally thousands of hours
01:49:53 of over the two campaigns.
01:49:55 It's super fun.
01:49:56 It's great.
01:49:57 Critical Role is like a bunch of professional voice actors,
01:50:00 DM'd by Matthew Mercer,
01:50:01 playing a Dungeons and Dragons campaign.
01:50:04 And it sounds gay, super fucking based,
01:50:07 because they all are doing like professional voice over
01:50:10 for all their characters.
01:50:10 And they get into character and like Matt Mercer
01:50:13 does like 50 different voices
01:50:14 and does voices for all the enemies
01:50:16 and all the NPCs.
01:50:17 Oh, it's grand.
01:50:18 10 out of 10 love critical role.
01:50:20 Definitely watch it.
01:50:21 I guess I could get maybe I'll start watching.
01:50:24 I'm sort of I'm sort of out of things
01:50:26 to watch on YouTube these days.
01:50:27 Maybe I should start watching.
01:50:29 I should go back and catch up on the seat.
01:50:32 This the the the the the sea team that fucking.
01:50:36 Oh God, what's the acquis acquisitions incorporated
01:50:39 the sea team?
01:50:40 Yeah, the like they do like a D&D thing.
01:50:44 Yeah, it's the penny.
01:50:46 It's the penny run by the penny.
01:50:47 I don't actually I don't watch the main series.
01:50:50 Acquisitions incorporated.
01:50:51 I own I mostly watch the like side series
01:50:54 with all their like fucking second rate friends.
01:50:56 You nobody's ever heard of now base.
01:51:00 Well, I've got some obvious suggestions.
01:51:03 But look, with the amount of time you got here,
01:51:04 there has never in there will never be very likely
01:51:07 a better time to catch up on one piece.
01:51:10 It's still my favorite thing.
01:51:12 You I mean, you can catch up on one piece
01:51:14 if you dedicate yourself over like two weeks
01:51:16 without too much of a sweat.
01:51:17 I would say.
01:51:17 Oh, yeah.
01:51:19 I have a little one piece to catch up on myself.
01:51:22 And then you can listen to the podcast every week, folks.
01:51:25 Wouldn't that be fun?
01:51:27 And you definitely start track.
01:51:29 Next generation is the best so far.
01:51:32 But if you like a little more edgy war stuff,
01:51:34 you can check out Deep Space Nine or the original
01:51:36 if you like more goofy shit.
01:51:38 And also it's a great time for big, long, old RPGs.
01:51:42 So how about fucking, you know,
01:51:43 Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy, any of them seven
01:51:46 is a good place to start.
01:51:47 I guess six, five, nine.
01:51:50 I realize I forgot that I had like Final Fantasy nine,
01:51:54 like the PlayStation one version.
01:51:55 Just I bought it one day and I never played it.
01:51:57 And now I'm playing it.
01:51:58 Do it.
01:51:58 It's a great game.
01:51:59 Dude, you would love nine.
01:52:00 I think it's really mine is so fucking good.
01:52:04 Going off the Star Trek recommendation,
01:52:06 if you like Star Trek and you finish Star Trek,
01:52:11 Babylon Five is so fucking good.
01:52:15 It's amazing.
01:52:16 It's another show that came out around, you know,
01:52:18 a little like a couple of years, I think after TNG,
01:52:21 it was like mid nineties, really fucking great,
01:52:24 great characters, great story.
01:52:27 Love it.
01:52:27 If you want more like cool sci-fi stuff,
01:52:30 Babylon Five does not disappoint.
01:52:32 Did you say bad that you hate nine just now?
01:52:34 No, I said I never beat it.
01:52:35 Oh, okay.
01:52:36 Well, that's, that's fine.
01:52:37 That's fine.
01:52:38 I still have to go back and beat three and eight.
01:52:40 I never beat six.
01:52:41 I never beat six either,
01:52:43 even though I consider it my favorite one.
01:52:45 That's all right.
01:52:45 There's tons to do in there.
01:52:46 Oh, they're good, good games.
01:52:49 Was there something else I was going to suggest?
01:52:52 Also, how about Legend of Dragoon?
01:52:53 There's a classic game that nobody talks about anymore.
01:52:56 We'll play Legend of Dragoon.
01:52:57 Great game.
01:52:58 I never beat that one either.
01:53:00 That game gets off the fucking rails in a good way.
01:53:03 Remember that legacy, Ben,
01:53:04 of how our disc three of Legend of Dragoon was broken
01:53:07 for so many years we could not play?
01:53:10 Jeff or whatever.
01:53:12 I think it was Matt.
01:53:13 Matt, he was playing Frisbee with the disc.
01:53:16 Oh, wait, no, that was later.
01:53:18 What about Buck?
01:53:19 Yeah, a guy in our fucking Boy Scout troop broke
01:53:24 disc three of Legend of Dragoon,
01:53:27 and it took forever for us to get our parents
01:53:30 to talk to his parents and make him fucking
01:53:32 buy us a new one.
01:53:33 I think ultimately, I think that did happen,
01:53:35 but I didn't even play it.
01:53:37 And then I lost it, and I was sad for years.
01:53:39 But then I think Ben, for Christmas one year,
01:53:42 bought me a new copy of Legend of Dragoon,
01:53:44 and with that, I finally beat the game.
01:53:46 Did I?
01:53:47 I think so.
01:53:49 That's my recollection anyway.
01:53:50 I vaguely remember that.
01:53:52 That sounds like it might have happened.
01:53:54 That's how I remember it happening.
01:53:55 And I'm glad it happened, because it was good,
01:53:58 and it's a great game, and literally save Legend of Dragoon.
01:54:03 Please, bring them back.
01:54:04 They're dying, and they deserve more.
01:54:05 There's no GDQ.
01:54:07 I would love to watch a speedrun of it.
01:54:09 I would love to watch a GDQ, but there's none.
01:54:11 There's like one speedrun video on YouTube of it,
01:54:14 but it's just like some guy.
01:54:17 And it's not that interesting,
01:54:18 because the commentary is very low energy and sporadic.
01:54:22 It doesn't strike me as a great game for speedrunning anyway.
01:54:24 It would like the weird ways that the encounters work,
01:54:27 and other stuff.
01:54:28 Ah, I don't know.
01:54:29 I don't know.
01:54:31 All right.
01:54:31 Well, you got plenty of suggestions there, folks.
01:54:33 Play some Viggy games.
01:54:34 Play the new Doom.
01:54:35 It's good.
01:54:36 I like it.
01:54:37 Or the old Doom.
01:54:38 That's also good.
01:54:39 Okay.
01:54:40 Play Kingdom Hearts.
01:54:41 Ooh, now's a good time to play the good Kingdom Hearts.
01:54:43 One, Chain of Memories.
01:54:44 Two, and I guess I'll put three in there,
01:54:47 now that there's good DLC for it.
01:54:48 Skip everything else.
01:54:50 Okay, we had more questions here.
01:54:52 Let me see.
01:54:54 How many more do we got?
01:54:55 Three more total, but this is like two and one.
01:54:57 So let's, we can do these real quick.
01:54:58 I'm still, I'm being like,
01:55:00 I've suddenly come over, been,
01:55:02 been swept over with a wave of fatigue.
01:55:04 Well, luckily.
01:55:05 Which is one of the symptoms of the coronavirus.
01:55:07 No.
01:55:08 Write it out, Ben.
01:55:09 We're getting there.
01:55:10 Okay.
01:55:10 Good news, everybody.
01:55:11 Get ready to have fun,
01:55:13 because it's riddled my ass Batman
01:55:15 with the Scooby-Doo murder mystery files.
01:55:18 He's calling in.
01:55:19 Oh, and by the way, he asked me to remind everybody
01:55:21 that canonically what's going on
01:55:23 is that Johnny Bravo is playing
01:55:26 who wants to be a PCP millionaire.
01:55:28 And so that's what's happening
01:55:30 when we last left our hero.
01:55:32 He missed his chance
01:55:32 because he didn't show up to the meet-ups
01:55:34 to get his PC penny.
01:55:35 Is that what, I'm sure that's true.
01:55:37 Well, that's how,
01:55:37 that's the easiest way to become a millionaire.
01:55:39 That's true.
01:55:40 That's true.
01:55:40 A PCP millionaire specifically.
01:55:42 So let's see how things go for our hero.
01:55:44 Okay.
01:55:45 Take it away.
01:55:45 Go.
01:55:47 Well, Johnny, would you like to continue?
01:55:48 We've been away on break for a while.
01:55:50 Is it like,
01:55:50 lay it on me, brother.
01:55:51 I really want to earn some money.
01:55:53 Hoo-ha-ha.
01:55:54 Take it, take it.
01:55:55 Okay.
01:55:56 Next question.
01:55:56 Who is about to kill Johnny Bravo?
01:55:59 What are you talking about?
01:55:59 Hoo-ha.
01:56:01 Oh, fuck.
01:56:03 Scooby-Doo-Doo.
01:56:05 That's who.
01:56:07 Where's my money?
01:56:09 Scooby-Doo at gunpoint?
01:56:10 I always knew I died this way.
01:56:13 Stop stalling.
01:56:14 Where's my money?
01:56:17 Scooby-Doo, give yourself up.
01:56:18 You're highly surrounded.
01:56:20 Better be careful.
01:56:21 I have one of my ass batman at gunpoint.
01:56:24 Like Scoob?
01:56:24 You don't have news, man?
01:56:26 Raggy, I always knew you'd betray me.
01:56:29 Hey, Scoob.
01:56:31 Yeah, where do I ask Batman?
01:56:32 Your plan has one fatal mistake.
01:56:36 Oh, yeah?
01:56:37 What would that be?
01:56:38 Before you killed Johnny Bravo, he taught me karate.
01:56:41 Hi-yah!
01:56:42 Karate suplex.
01:56:45 Well, well, Raggy.
01:56:48 Take it away, boys.
01:56:50 He was like, I would have gotten away with the two that weren't for you.
01:56:53 Where are my ass batman?
01:56:54 You meddling kids.
01:56:55 Thank you.
01:56:57 Thank you.
01:56:58 To the next time for the exciting backstory of the predicament.
01:57:01 And Scooby-Doo, mystery murder files.
01:57:07 I'd have to know the backstory.
01:57:09 I'd have to know the content.
01:57:12 Yeah, I'm dying.
01:57:12 Mystery murder files.
01:57:14 What?
01:57:18 That's got great news.
01:57:19 The little full starts make this like elevated like seven rungs up the ladder of greatness.
01:57:25 It's so true.
01:57:26 It's so keep it going riddle my ass Batman.
01:57:28 It's so weird.
01:57:28 I think he wanted to come to the meet up but he couldn't do it for whatever reason.
01:57:32 So we missed you, buddy.
01:57:33 We missed you.
01:57:34 What a shame.
01:57:34 We have you in our thoughts and prayers.
01:57:37 I had forgotten the joy of a riddle my ass Batman voice.
01:57:41 They never fail.
01:57:42 And so I forget it like with the Johnny Bravo thing.
01:57:46 I think that was just called who wants to be a PCP millionaire.
01:57:50 If I remember correctly.
01:57:50 I just happened to have Johnny Bravo in it.
01:57:52 But now the fact that it's called the Scooby-Doo murder mystery murder files.
01:57:57 It's actually Scooby-Doo is doing the murder mystery.
01:58:01 He is the criminal in these in these files.
01:58:03 And I wonder if there'll be more.
01:58:05 Right.
01:58:06 Scooby-Doo sounded a lot like Batman.
01:58:09 He did.
01:58:10 Yeah.
01:58:10 He did.
01:58:11 He occasionally sounded a little bit like Batman.
01:58:14 Sometimes.
01:58:15 Sometimes.
01:58:15 Okay.
01:58:16 Say what he said.
01:58:16 Racky.
01:58:17 That's I've got good news.
01:58:18 We heard a little bit of it there at the end.
01:58:19 But we've been provided a full Scooby-Doo mystery murder theme song by riddle my ass Batman.
01:58:26 So let's let's listen and enjoy.
01:58:28 Take it away.
01:58:30 Look out for Scooby-Doo.
01:58:31 He's going to murder you.
01:58:32 He's going to rape you and I see you Scooby-Doo and your Mr.
01:58:37 Murder Crew.
01:58:38 Look out for Scooby-Doo because he's going to murder you.
01:58:42 Don't look back till you find a safer path.
01:58:47 Scooby's wrath will be waiting there for you.
01:58:51 Look out for Scooby-Doo.
01:58:53 He's going to murder you.
01:58:54 He's going to rape you in the butt.
01:58:57 I see you Scooby-Doo and your Mr. Murder Crew.
01:59:00 Look out for Scooby-Doo because he's going to murder you.
01:59:07 Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na.
01:59:13 Scooby-Doo's going to murder you.
01:59:16 Say it again.
01:59:17 Yeah.
01:59:19 More on-core.
01:59:20 That was great.
01:59:21 Is that the second OP?
01:59:23 Maybe it is.
01:59:24 Yeah, maybe it is.
01:59:25 That's my favorite one for sure.
01:59:28 Incredible.
01:59:29 Keep it coming.
01:59:30 Love it.
01:59:31 All right.
01:59:31 We've got one more, one more message and this one's coming in hot from an individual known as
01:59:36 The Big Gay.
01:59:38 Okay.
01:59:39 Let's clear the floor and let them see them.
01:59:41 From RCK?
01:59:42 It could be.
01:59:43 Let's find out.
01:59:44 Take it away.
01:59:44 Go.
01:59:45 I am a big smelly gay demon and I hate everything good.
01:59:51 That is why I hate the PCP dating sim releasing on April 1st.
01:59:58 Don't play it unless you want to have a good time.
02:00:02 Don't go to Twitter at PCP dating for updates.
02:00:06 Don't download the game on April 1st.
02:00:09 Especially don't live stream it if you're a PCP member.
02:00:14 That would be terrible.
02:00:17 You don't want to end up gay like me.
02:00:25 That, that voice mail, that was from Oblivionfall.
02:00:29 He told, he told me he was sending it.
02:00:31 Classic, classic Big Gay.
02:00:33 And so when you hear this.
02:00:36 Five days, April 1st will be the release of the PCP dating sim according to this.
02:00:43 Is Oblivionfall the Big Gay?
02:00:46 It sounded like them snakes to me.
02:00:47 It sounded like them snakes.
02:00:49 I was thinking it sounded like a little like them snakes too.
02:00:52 Is this just a coincidence that there's another guy called The Big Gay?
02:00:56 I feel like it's a coincidence but I don't know for sure.
02:00:59 I'm not sure.
02:00:59 Oh god, what a fucking quagmire.
02:01:01 Indeed.
02:01:02 Didn't the demo for the PCP dating sim come out last April 1st?
02:01:07 That sounds right.
02:01:08 It did.
02:01:09 Yeah, and we all thought they were joking and it wasn't a real thing.
02:01:13 That is true.
02:01:14 You see, I was gonna say, let's not ignore the fact that they're releasing this quote
02:01:18 unquote project on quote unquote April 1st, April Fool's Day.
02:01:23 That's what we thought last time.
02:01:24 Yeah, it is.
02:01:25 But then it really happened.
02:01:26 The joke then.
02:01:28 The tweet literally said the joke was that they spent way too much time.
02:01:31 Right, right.
02:01:31 That was the joke then.
02:01:32 Now the joke is that that was all a joke and none of it's actually coming out.
02:01:36 There is no game.
02:01:37 It's a first tapestry.
02:01:38 Yeah, I mean, they swiped this joke.
02:01:39 They said it would come out before Radcon 4 and that we could play it live.
02:01:43 But they failed.
02:01:44 That's okay, that's okay.
02:01:44 They fucked it up.
02:01:46 It's all a big joke.
02:01:47 They're just gonna, they're gonna post.
02:01:48 They're just buying time eternally now.
02:01:51 They're just gonna post a PDF that you can't open.
02:01:53 I won't be able to figure out how to open that.
02:01:55 And that'll really quagmire my presidency.
02:01:57 I'm very excited.
02:01:59 I trust Oblivion to deliver this message.
02:02:01 I believe that it's true, even though I don't have any proof or anything.
02:02:05 There you go.
02:02:06 April 1st people.
02:02:06 We have only his word.
02:02:08 Indeed.
02:02:08 I assume on the behalf of...
02:02:10 I don't know if Oblivion even worked with them to work on it.
02:02:12 Maybe they just asked him to convey the message.
02:02:14 I don't know.
02:02:15 I have no idea.
02:02:17 I don't even know if that was like his recording.
02:02:19 Maybe he was like past it a lot.
02:02:20 I don't know.
02:02:21 I don't know what's going on.
02:02:22 But April 4th people, go follow at its PCP...
02:02:26 You mean dating.
02:02:27 April 1st.
02:02:28 April 1st, that's right.
02:02:29 Which is gonna be five days after you hear this, people.
02:02:32 So pretty soon.
02:02:33 Oh god, it's upon us.
02:02:34 It's upon us.
02:02:35 We were just last episode saying like where the fuck is it?
02:02:37 I don't consent, viewer.
02:02:40 You're not allowed to fucking use my route.
02:02:42 My route is off limits.
02:02:44 It's for me and my future god-chosen, destined wife.
02:02:51 Jennifer Diane Wright.
02:02:52 Jennifer Diane Wright's aunt, yes.
02:02:55 And Steven Lepisto.
02:02:57 And Sandra Woodruff.
02:02:58 Join the Collective.
02:02:59 And fucking...
02:02:59 Ben's joining that Polly Amherst relationship.
02:03:02 Whatever the fucking name was.
02:03:03 The real life Borg cube over there.
02:03:06 It's based.
02:03:08 Well there you go, people.
02:03:09 I'm pretty excited about it.
02:03:10 That was our last voicemail update with the PCP dating sim.
02:03:13 Very excited to see how that turns out.
02:03:14 So check out it a couple days.
02:03:16 Eldenath.
02:03:17 Eldenath de Vilio, that was the fourth one.
02:03:20 Who could forget that memorable character?
02:03:22 All right, well that's it everybody.
02:03:23 Hey, leave more voicemails.
02:03:24 Speakpipelink is in the description.
02:03:26 Keep them coming.
02:03:27 We will be listening to them and rolling them out
02:03:29 and enjoying them as you've seen here.
02:03:31 And other than that, at...
02:03:34 No, not at.
02:03:34 It's patreon.com.
02:03:36 Flash the procrastinators is where you need to go for all.
02:03:40 Excuse me.
02:03:41 The best PCP related bullshit.
02:03:44 I think when you hear this...
02:03:45 Bonus episodes.
02:03:46 A bonus episode is coming out like a couple...
02:03:48 Oh well it should be on April 1st.
02:03:50 Which will be the day that the bonus...
02:03:52 The fucking dating sim comes out.
02:03:54 So get ready for that ladies and gentlemen.
02:03:57 And there's like fucking 35 other ones.
02:03:59 So what a deal.
02:04:00 $5 a month or so.
02:04:03 Give us money.
02:04:04 We would be eternally grateful.
02:04:06 And more and more PCP stuff from Radcon 4.
02:04:10 We'll be rolling out as you will expect.
02:04:12 So watch for updates on the Kickstarter page.
02:04:14 I'm sure we'll be announcing and retweeting a lot of them
02:04:17 on Twitter at TPCrastinators.
02:04:19 So as always follow that for updates and stuff.
02:04:22 And I think at some point I think we want to make available
02:04:25 via purchase to those latecomers the like the bonus footage.
02:04:30 We'll probably sell it for some amount.
02:04:32 Kind of like we did with the Radcon 3 stuff.
02:04:34 So if you missed out you may get a chance
02:04:36 to catch some of it later on.
02:04:38 But we'll we'll keep you posted about that.
02:04:40 Probably be another thing on Gumroad or whatever.
02:04:43 In any case that's going to do it.
02:04:45 Cool.
02:04:46 That's it for the episode.
02:04:47 Sounds pretty base.
02:04:48 Not bad.
02:04:49 If yes.
02:04:49 Ooh.
02:04:50 Very little cringe.
02:04:52 Ending the episode though.
02:04:54 Totally cringe.
02:04:54 That is cringe.
02:04:55 Not base.
02:04:56 In fact that's not three, four, five hours long.
02:04:58 A pathetic two hours.
02:05:01 Not not.
02:05:01 Particularly base.
02:05:02 That's all there is to say about it.
02:05:03 Okay I gotta go.
02:05:04 I gotta go play Doom.
02:05:06 I gotta go work on videos.
02:05:07 I gotta fight more bosses in Kingdom Hearts 3.
02:05:10 Remind.
02:05:10 Oh my god I love my life.
02:05:12 And I love my body.
