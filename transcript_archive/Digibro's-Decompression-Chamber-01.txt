00:00:00 What's up motherfuckers?
00:00:28 Welcome to the first inaugural episode of Digibro's Compression Chamber, a podcast
00:00:36 about nothing in which I attempt to relax as relaxing is against my nature.
00:00:45 You know, I'm one of those guys, you probably hear us talk about our plight all the time,
00:00:52 I know I hear Jesse talk about it all the time.
00:00:55 I'm one of those guys who tends to make everything into a project.
00:01:00 Every time I get an idea in my head, it spirals out of control and becomes a thing.
00:01:06 And thankfully, unlike Jesse, my projects are never, they're never something that's
00:01:11 gonna take me a whole month to do.
00:01:13 It's more like I get constant ideas for little projects and I just burn through them as fast
00:01:19 as I possibly can.
00:01:21 And if I don't burn through them fast enough, they just get left by the wayside.
00:01:26 If a project's too big for those couple of days when I'm excited about it or if it just
00:01:30 takes a little bit too much mental energy, it's gonna fall by the wayside, you know.
00:01:37 It's so hard for me to have, to just like, to try to just do things at a normal rate
00:01:44 to just, you know, take a few days to get something done if it needs it or hold off
00:01:50 on the next idea until, until the time comes, you know, just, instead it's like this constant
00:01:57 like the second I come up with the next thing, the last thing has to be over so I can work
00:02:02 on the next thing and then I don't know where I am anymore after a little while, I'll guide
00:02:07 you through what this is like in a moment.
00:02:09 But just to explain the nature of this podcast, you know, I'm laying on the couch with a beer,
00:02:14 I encourage you to do the same to, to imitate me in this podcast.
00:02:22 And I'm just trying to decompress.
00:02:28 You know, I used to, I used to sort of do this on Digi Bros, which is a show, my Let's
00:02:33 Play show, my Let's Play channel that hasn't been very active lately because it used to
00:02:38 be that me and my brother Victor would get together every week or two and we'd talk about
00:02:43 all the stuff that was going in our lives over the course of the, you know, the time
00:02:47 we'd been apart.
00:02:49 But Victor is almost never around anymore.
00:02:52 Since our parents moved out at the start of September, Victor has mostly been at his girlfriend
00:02:59 Hope's house.
00:03:01 He's probably going to be moving in with their, like, you know, next year at some point.
00:03:06 He mostly uses our house as like a studio space.
00:03:09 He comes here to work on editing and stuff.
00:03:13 Anytime he has like a, you know, he needs to get work done or something, but he barely
00:03:18 ever is just hanging out here.
00:03:20 So I don't see him a whole lot.
00:03:23 And you know, we keep saying we're going to do another Digi Bros because we've had like
00:03:27 a month of nonstop things happening that we could talk about, but it hasn't been happening.
00:03:32 But you know, even then with that show, it's like there's a difference between the way
00:03:40 you talk about something to get it off your chest and the way you talk about something
00:03:45 to another person, you know, and with Victor, there's a certain security in that I've known
00:03:51 him my whole life and nothing I could possibly say would surprise him or would make him want
00:03:55 to comment on it, you know.
00:03:57 Victor has a very like standoffish approach to my life.
00:04:03 If I tell him something that's going on with me, he doesn't try to give me any advice.
00:04:07 He doesn't try to like analyze it in any way.
00:04:10 He's just like, yeah, that sure is a thing that happened, you know, and that makes him
00:04:14 easier to talk to in that way.
00:04:19 But even then, you know, it's still a person who I'm trying to present things to in like
00:04:23 the story like way, you know, the way I talk on DigiBros is very heightened, like I'm
00:04:28 trying to be entertaining or to put a spin on the story.
00:04:32 That's not what this podcast is about.
00:04:35 This podcast is being recorded in such a way that it's as though there is no audience.
00:04:40 I've even played with the idea of turning off comments for these videos, but I do actually
00:04:45 want to know how people think of the show itself, you know, if not particularly the topics
00:04:52 at hand.
00:04:54 But you know, I think that when I do a podcast with another person or even when I do a vlog,
00:05:01 there's a certain like level of putting on airs, there's a certain level of trying to
00:05:05 find the perfect words and describe everything in a way that's going to, you know, make the
00:05:09 most sense to the other person as opposed to just like decompressing.
00:05:14 I don't want to use the word venting because this isn't about being angry or like stressed
00:05:19 out.
00:05:20 I actually feel really good right now.
00:05:23 The reason I need to decompress is that there's just so much I'm doing and so much going on
00:05:28 that like I need a moment, you know, and for me, taking a moment is near impossible.
00:05:33 Like how can I possibly take a moment that I'm not like working on anything?
00:05:40 It's hard to justify to myself.
00:05:41 It's like when I, you know, usually I'll go for a walk or something, but those aren't
00:05:47 really to decompress so much as usually it's because I'm trying to think of more things
00:05:51 to do.
00:05:52 Like I'll go for a walk because I need the next video to write and I'm trying to come
00:05:56 up with an idea and then like while I'm out on that walk, then, you know, if at some point
00:06:02 I finally come up with an idea, then I'll like rush home to get it done, you know, like
00:06:06 I won't walk as long if I come up with something I really want to do before the walk is over.
00:06:13 But like I'm constantly searching for the next idea.
00:06:17 I'm constantly like beating over my, beating myself over the head to come up with something
00:06:21 as opposed to just like chilling out for a second and like, you know, maybe reveling
00:06:26 in what I have done, you know, I have a tendency I will do things like, you know, a video comes
00:06:31 out, I feel accomplished, I go out and buy something to eat to celebrate, you know, and
00:06:36 I do have moments like when a big thing happens that I cool off, but I think that there's
00:06:41 possibly some bad behavior being instigated by that and I'm going to get into why when
00:06:46 I describe my past week because I've all, I've kind of been building up to like why
00:06:50 I need to decompress.
00:06:52 So this past, oh my God, it's almost two weeks actually now that I'm realizing it.
00:06:59 The past week and a half to two weeks has been one of the most productive periods of
00:07:03 my entire life.
00:07:05 Now I'm someone who generally bounces between periods of insane productivity and periods
00:07:12 of eh productivity and usually those periods of eh productivity involves a lot of socializing.
00:07:18 Usually if I'm not getting a lot of stuff done, it's because I'm spending a lot of time
00:07:22 with other people or I'm trying to set up something, you know, something complicated.
00:07:29 Usually it's, it's because I'm doing something else other than work and I don't have enough
00:07:34 good ideas to drag me back to work, but as soon as those good ideas come, as soon as
00:07:38 I get inspired again, I come rushing back.
00:07:42 So here's what's been inspiring so much in the last couple weeks.
00:07:46 You know, me and DeVu, we were starting to work on, starting to work on videos together
00:07:52 towards the end of September.
00:07:53 We'd taken sort of a long break.
00:07:56 We had Radcon, you know, we had a lot of stuff going on.
00:07:59 We were trying to get ourselves sorted out and then we pumped out these two videos at
00:08:03 the end of September and I felt really good about that.
00:08:06 So then we got to work on the next one, which is Akiyuki Shinbo in the 90s, which is a project
00:08:11 that I'd had on hold for like a whole year.
00:08:13 I'd started it in at the end of 2015 and I thought there was no way I'd be willing to
00:08:21 edit it myself because I was going to edit it myself at the time and like just the thought
00:08:26 of how much effort it was going to take, which the kind of editing that it is, is the kind
00:08:30 of stuff that DeVu is just really good at.
00:08:33 I literally don't know how he edits these so fast.
00:08:39 He's most of the way through part two after about a day and a half and he keeps assuring
00:08:45 me, oh, don't worry, I'm almost done and stuff, I'm not worried, I can't believe you're working
00:08:49 this fast.
00:08:51 It's incredible how fast he can find all the specific examples that are needed for something.
00:08:57 What made it possible is that he, because the reason I wasn't going to ask him to do
00:09:02 it, is because there's a lot of stuff you have to watch for this and at the time that
00:09:07 I was working on it, he wasn't on my full-time payroll yet, but the biggest thing is that
00:09:12 he would have to watch all of Yu-Yu Hakusho, which is 112 episodes.
00:09:16 It just so happened that he ended up doing that anyway.
00:09:18 Him and his brother went ahead and just watched Yu-Yu Hakusho for the hell of it and then
00:09:23 I was like, oh my god, if you've seen all of Yu-Yu Hakusho, then you're already halfway
00:09:27 done with everything you need to watch, more than halfway done, for Shinbo in the 90s.
00:09:32 So I took the project off Hiatus and the two of us jammed it out.
00:09:38 I got the whole thing written, he's almost done editing it, he went on like a weird little
00:09:44 sabbatical for a few days because he went down what he calls a video game hole where
00:09:48 he, every once in a while, he remembers that he's really obsessed with video games and
00:09:53 then he just doesn't do anything but think about how badly he wants to make games and
00:09:57 then he snaps out of it when he runs out of money or something and so he gets back to
00:10:02 work on anime videos.
00:10:07 So while he was doing that though, we had come up with this idea where I was like, actually
00:10:16 he was talking about how in 2014 I put out a video every single day for a month, for
00:10:21 the month of October.
00:10:23 It was a challenge to myself that had a few purposes.
00:10:26 One was because I'd already written most of the 8 Nights of Karinokyokai series and so
00:10:31 I felt like I was already, I had a good foot in the door if I wanted to do it, I wanted
00:10:35 to do some kind of challenge video thing and I also wanted to have more anime videos on
00:10:42 my channel because I was concerned with the fact that, you know, in order to really have
00:10:47 a rapport with a reviewer, you need to really know a lot of their opinions, you can't really
00:10:52 get a sense of how you feel about someone's stance on things if you don't know their stance
00:10:58 on things.
00:10:59 So I wanted to review a lot of anime in a short period of time so people would get a better
00:11:03 sense of my tastes and just how I write and stuff like that.
00:11:08 So all of that sort of culminated in this thing and in order to make it happen, I made
00:11:12 bets with everyone I know, basically, I got everyone to put in money against me on whether
00:11:19 or not I could finish this in a month.
00:11:23 With the caveat being that each video was supposed to be of a level of quality that
00:11:26 it could be patroned if I wanted to, though I did not patron most of them and some of
00:11:30 them were definitely not of that level of quality, but nonetheless I did do it.
00:11:36 I did a video every day for a month in October and it was a big cool thing and it's funny
00:11:41 because I've never really gotten a lot of credit for it because my channel was fairly
00:11:46 small at the time and not so much in subscriber count, but people weren't watching my videos
00:11:51 because I was pretty new to anime and I didn't have a lot of followers who cared about anime
00:11:57 that deeply and I had a lot of stuff that I was talking about that nobody cared about
00:12:02 so I don't think anybody watched every video that month except probably the DeVu who at
00:12:09 that point had just started working for me as an editor and he got done, he got a couple
00:12:14 of those videos edited himself, so a couple of my biggest videos came out that month,
00:12:21 like back to back what is anime and what isn't and Sword Art Online sucks part one came out
00:12:29 that month.
00:12:30 Anyways, point being he wanted to try to do that again, like with him editing and me writing
00:12:35 which would make it twice as easy to get it done and I was like well a video every single
00:12:40 day might be pushing it because the quality definitely suffered in the previous attempt,
00:12:46 you know there's a lot of videos from that month that are not worth going back to really.
00:12:50 So I thought well what if we did one every other day and the concept will be a novel
00:12:56 worth of videos because November is coming and November is National Novel Writing Month.
00:13:03 Now I've been trying National Novel Writing Month every year since like 2006, I want to
00:13:08 say I've been doing it a straight decade now, I succeeded in 2010, I wrote a novel, I never
00:13:17 looked at it again after the month was over, like I wrote on the last day, the last day
00:13:25 I wrote 24,000 words, I wrote a thousand words an hour for 24 hours and that's how I finished
00:13:33 my novel because I hadn't touched it in like two weeks and it was way behind and I just
00:13:40 jammed it out in a day and then never looked at it again because it was such a mess, the
00:13:45 book was just so like full of plot holes and structural issues and bad writing that I just
00:13:52 didn't look at it ever again but all I cared about was that I had won Nano Remo because
00:13:58 I wrote 50,000 words in a month.
00:14:00 So then last year I wanted to do a novel in videos but I didn't have any good ideas until
00:14:09 like late into November when I came up with the Asterisk War Sucks series which did end
00:14:14 up being a novel in videos but I started writing it at like the very end of November and ended
00:14:20 around the end of December so I think it might have been slightly over a month and either
00:14:23 way it wasn't, I wasn't keeping track of it basically, I wasn't keeping track of time,
00:14:29 I didn't know it would be a novel length by the end but it was great that it turned out
00:14:34 that way.
00:14:35 So then this month I thought well what if we just straight up do that and so I wrote
00:14:39 myself out a day to day calendar like of how you know the Nano Remo thing is that you have
00:14:45 to write 1,667 words a day in order to hit 50,000 by the end of the month.
00:14:51 Now obviously you can write as much in a day as you want to play catch up if you need to.
00:14:56 Currently I have to catch up, I'm a few days behind but I've been doing pretty well.
00:15:02 Now when I came up with this I was like okay well the concept is 15 videos right?
00:15:09 So 15 out of 50,000 is something like 3,500 something like that I think maybe even 4,000.
00:15:22 It's a lot of words for one video because 15 videos that would all have to be like basically
00:15:28 between 15 and 20 minutes long is about the length that I would get from a 3,500 word
00:15:34 post.
00:15:36 So in order for that to happen each of these videos would have to be pretty long for it
00:15:41 to have to be a novel worth of videos and so I started writing these posts and very quickly
00:15:46 realized that they're not that long, they're probably closer to 10 minutes so I've been
00:15:51 doing a great job of keeping up with my daily quota of words but I also am quickly realizing
00:15:57 that I'm going to exceed 15 videos that I've written this month.
00:16:02 So whether or not DeVu ends up editing more or less I don't know, all I know is I'm stacking
00:16:07 up a backlog that's pretty fucking nice to look at right now.
00:16:12 I wrote 6 posts in 5 and a half days, I wrote 6 posts all of which I love, all 6 of them
00:16:22 I thought were great, I'm proud of all of them, they're all things from my bucket list.
00:16:26 Like basically there's certain videos I've wanted to write for a very long time and just
00:16:32 never like got around to it because one reason or another and then finally just like having
00:16:37 the pressure of like alright let's see if we can do it now and each every single day
00:16:42 that I've written for this I had started at like midnight like it was like 45 minutes
00:16:49 before I would be out of time for the day and I'm trying to catch up with the word count
00:16:52 you know so I'm trying to crank these things out like a thousand words to 1500 words in
00:16:58 an hour and they're coming out great like because of it because I'm just forcing myself
00:17:03 to actually fucking write this thing that I've been thinking I don't know how it's
00:17:08 going to be I don't know how to structure it and then like once you're in the moment
00:17:11 and it's like alright let's just first sentence that comes to mind fucking throw it down and
00:17:16 we'll go from there you know we'll structure it based on that and that's been a great idea
00:17:21 so I wrote six videos that I'm really into then so I'm I've got that going on and I'm
00:17:29 on like you know day six I'm kind of I start a video that I don't really like you know
00:17:34 I wrote a couple paragraphs and I was like this isn't going how I want it to go so it
00:17:38 kind of cool it cooling off to that you know just a little bit and then I I'm just this
00:17:44 is what I'm talking about with ideas that come up out of nowhere and then totally change
00:17:48 everything I'm doing so everyone's talking about this music video called shelter right
00:17:54 it's it's this little anime music video put together it's an a1 pictures thing everyone's
00:18:00 like like looking at me like oh do you hate this because it's a1 it's like it's like one
00:18:05 person made this it's like there's the director and then the animator who animated the whole
00:18:11 fucking thing you know and then like the the musician who made the music I don't even think
00:18:16 it's like to think of it as an a1 pictures thing is kind of like besides the point it's
00:18:21 obviously these two people's creation but nonetheless I don't really care for it I think
00:18:27 it's it's it's fairly trite and as much movement as there is in the animation the style of it
00:18:34 didn't really interest or impress me so yeah I wasn't that into it but nonetheless I saw
00:18:43 all these people talking about it and I thought man this is a great opportunity to talk about
00:18:47 anime music videos because one of the reasons that my my number of completed shows on my anime
00:18:55 list is so fucking high is because I watch lots of shorts I'll go through these phases we're all
00:19:01 just like spend a couple days like marathoning tons of music videos or other shorts and I think
00:19:08 they're really cool and like they're great way to see like lots of experimental different stuff
00:19:15 not all of it's good in fact not even most of it's good most of it's pretty middle of the road
00:19:20 usually it's like well that was kind of cool I guess but it was totally pointless and I'll never
00:19:25 think about it again it's pretty rare to get music videos that you actually like want to revisit
00:19:31 amazing but nonetheless I watched like all of them and so I thought what if I made a video like
00:19:40 10 cool anime music videos you should all check out since you're so psyched about this one here's
00:19:45 all these other great ones so then of course I think well if I want to do that I should make
00:19:51 sure I know every cool music video you know what if I make this video and I totally miss out on
00:19:57 like the coolest one ever so I go to my anime list and I sort you know by music video and like
00:20:04 you know show me all the completed music videos out there and there's 10 pages of about 50 shows
00:20:11 a page and I look at that and I think I bet I could do that I'm yeah 500 I mean they're only like
00:20:19 three to five minutes a piece so what's the big deal you know now I've been skipping I'm skipping
00:20:27 all the ones that that I can't find obviously those there's a there's a lot of them that I just
00:20:32 straight up can't find I'm skipping a lot of the ones that are tie-ins to shows because most of
00:20:36 those are awful it's usually like the opening theme song and they they animated a little thing and
00:20:42 it's always shit um the best ones would be stuff like the love live ones where they just make like
00:20:48 a music video but I I hate idol shows and I can't get into it at all I watched the video for um snow
00:20:56 halation and I was like this sure feels like an idol music video I mean it's incredibly well done
00:21:01 but I I don't like it you know I don't like the music I don't like idols uh so did didn't do much
00:21:07 for me but nonetheless um skipping most of those and any video that I'm just like I think is total
00:21:13 shit from the start I'll just stop watching it but nonetheless I go down this whole of music videos
00:21:20 and so for like you know this is an idea I've just had on a whim and then 12 hours later I've
00:21:26 been doing nothing but watching videos for 12 hours you know I have forgotten to eat or breathe
00:21:33 I'm just sitting there in a chair you know watching music videos non-stop and it's at some point I
00:21:41 got to the point where I'm like I'm not sure if I'm interested enough in this idea to keep going
00:21:47 like if this takes more than three days then I feel like the the hype from uh what's it called
00:21:54 we'll we'll have died down enough that like no one will be as open to this like it really felt
00:21:59 like something that had to happen now it had to be a flash in the pan it had to be completed all at once
00:22:08 so then as I'm working on this as I'm watching all these videos downstairs Davoo
00:22:16 is editing akuki shimbo in the 90s part one and he's finishing it up so I come downstairs you know
00:22:23 I think I had him wake me up I was like wake me up when it's done so he wakes me up
00:22:27 you know after I've slept probably eight hours after just a non-stop video music video binge all
00:22:33 night I come downstairs and I watch shimbo part one it's great we we you know workshop it a little
00:22:38 bit fix some things I upload it now as soon as I started seeing positive reactions to this
00:22:47 now mind you akuki shimbo in the 90s I knew from the start this is a video that's not going to get
00:22:54 a ton of views this is a video that not a ton of people are gonna care about some people are gonna
00:22:59 find it boring and stupid I will be shocked if anyone gets a lot out of it but the second there
00:23:05 was even one comment that was like this is the kind of stuff I come to you for or like wow such an
00:23:12 impressive amount of research or man I really learned to appreciate shimbo's work so much more
00:23:19 and I'm gonna check out some of these shows it only takes one comment like that to make me like
00:23:25 all right now we got to do part two you know like now we got to do the next one I mean
00:23:30 literal part two was already in the works of shinbo in the 90s but like shinbo in the 2000s
00:23:36 is a whole other animal and I was gonna hold off for a little bit because the project is gonna be
00:23:42 unbelievably massive I probably have to watch a hundred shows for this project like there's 70
00:23:49 that I definitely have to watch and those are ranging from you know two episodes to 26 at the
00:23:58 most so that's yeah that's like 70 shows I have to watch no matter what for this project now I don't
00:24:06 have to watch all of them before starting the project before any videos can come out like the
00:24:11 way I've been looking at it there might I might be able to like gradually put these out over like a
00:24:16 long course of time but nonetheless this is a titanic sized project and I was gonna just hold off
00:24:24 but the second I got that spark of inspiration it was like I gotta do it I gotta at least make the
00:24:31 preparations for it you know because there's a lot of prep work to be done I have to basically mostly
00:24:37 it's about organizing all of the data I have figuring out exactly what I need to watch why
00:24:43 who worked on it and what else they worked on that's basically the basis of it so I spend
00:24:50 probably six or seven hours putting together a list of every show that shinbo's been involved with
00:25:00 from the soul taker onwards and everyone who's worked on more than one of those shows so if
00:25:07 there's a name that appears in the credits of two shows that he worked on now I only went for major
00:25:13 credits no one who's just like a key animator or an in-between or something that would be
00:25:19 I mean what I'm doing is already psychotic but that would be next level psychotic I mean
00:25:23 that would be psychotic on a literal level like no one would do that no matter how like it's just
00:25:30 not even a good idea there's no point to it but um anyone who's a major staffer I made the connections
00:25:37 and I put together this fucking huge list and then I spent two days of just straight work
00:25:46 turning that into a spreadsheet I have spent two entire days turning it into a spreadsheet
00:25:54 and the funniest thing about it is that it was the easiest most natural thing in the world for me
00:25:59 to do there is nothing that comes more natural to me than making lists and just putting data
00:26:06 into boxes like I've often thought that if I like if if for some reason I had to get a desk job
00:26:14 I'm gonna go for a data entry job because that shit I don't know if I'll be as into it if it's
00:26:19 not about something I care about but like I am just unbelievably good at zoning out
00:26:26 and making a list all night long I at no point had the thought like like oh this has to get done
00:26:37 it was just I just did it and like the first day it was a natural progression right like I
00:26:44 finished making my list and so then I started making the spreadsheet and then at some point I
00:26:49 was too tired to go on and I passed out I woke up at 11 30 p.m or no no what stopped me working on
00:26:56 the spreadsheet was I had to record the pcp uh Nate was gathering everybody together he was
00:27:02 really I was like I was too tired I wasn't gonna do it but he he conned me into it I did the pcp
00:27:09 and then I read some comics and then I went to bed woke up at 11 30 p.m I sat down in my chair
00:27:17 the spreadsheet was open and I didn't even like ask myself do I want to do something else first
00:27:23 I just started working on it and I didn't stop for 12 hours that's just it I just sat down
00:27:31 and I worked on it for 12 hours and it was it was helped as well by the fact that like
00:27:37 I've been in sort of a musical slump for most of this year uh you know I'm a big music fan but
00:27:44 I've kind of run out of like music that I that I like that I'm not sick of I listen to the same
00:27:50 shit over and over and over and over again I was getting tired of all the uh all the stuff I had
00:27:55 and I wasn't finding anything new I was I was out there on the prowl you know I ask people for
00:28:00 recommendations all the time but nobody knows what I like so yeah I can never find anything
00:28:05 new I haven't liked much of the new stuff coming out this year um so I decided I was like I need
00:28:12 a revolution I need to just go out there and start downloading shit and mass and fill my computer
00:28:18 first of all fill it with all the stuff it's missing because most of my stuff that I have on my
00:28:23 computer um is new because like at some point my um my hard drive died at like the start of 2014
00:28:33 and I lost all the music I had and I just never got it all back like all that I had on my computer
00:28:40 was stuff that was on my phone so anything that was still on the phone is on the computer and
00:28:45 there's like certain certain albums I've gone and like re-downloaded it or re-burned it to my
00:28:49 computer but there's like whole discographies of bands that I love that I haven't looked into
00:28:55 in you know the last two years and then also there's lots of songs that I've accumulated over time
00:29:01 that like that are like singles by bands that I don't really like any of their albums but I really
00:29:05 like that single but I've never downloaded the albums I just go to YouTube every once in a blue
00:29:10 moon you know and and and listen to it so I thought I'll download all those discographies too so I
00:29:15 found a reliable Russian torrenting site and just started mass downloading music and uh that helped
00:29:24 a lot with the spreadsheet making because listening to a band's entire discography is hard to make
00:29:30 time for unless you're doing a menial task that takes all fucking day and really leaves you with
00:29:38 like most of your brain space open to listen to music so I listened to like countless hours of Omar
00:29:46 Rodriguez Lopez music that's the guitarist for the Mars Volta who puts out um he he's basically like
00:29:54 a light novel artist of music he puts out stuff fucking constantly for ever since like 2006 he's
00:30:01 had at minimum like four albums a year and then this year he's pulling a full-blown NCOE scene and
00:30:07 doing an album a month every month all year the man's crazy he's not as bad as Buckethead but he's
00:30:13 crazy so I downloaded like 30 Omar albums and I was listening to a bunch of those then I downloaded
00:30:19 like the whole discography of Bad Religion which is a band who has like like 10 singles that I love
00:30:25 that I never heard an album of theirs so I was listening to their discography and I gotta say
00:30:29 I was surprised that a lot of it is pretty good like I expected it to just pretty much be the
00:30:35 singles but there's other great songs in there those guys are masters of hooks they write the
00:30:39 best hooks in the world there's so many songs with memorable choruses I it's it's it's crazy
00:30:46 because all their songs sound exactly the same except that they all have a different awesome
00:30:49 memorable chorus um so I was listening to all that um AFI downloaded their discography only to
00:30:58 realize that the one I grew up with December Underground is probably their only good album
00:31:04 but it is a great album I like I mean it was partly nostalgia for me but that album is fantastic
00:31:10 I like didn't remember it being as good as it was when I listened to it just now and I was like whoa
00:31:16 finally downloaded the fucking mindless self-indulgence discography I haven't had them on my computer
00:31:21 since the crash two years ago and immediately I realized mindless self-indulgence might be
00:31:28 my actual favorite band and I just forgotten all this time because I didn't have them on my computer
00:31:34 but my god I love them so much and yeah if you haven't noticed I'm mostly like
00:31:41 downloading stuff that I listened to when I was like a teenager or uh or like a young adult
00:31:48 I'm in that phase in my life where uh you know all all like
00:31:55 concept of guilt like guilty pleasures like I mean I don't believe in guilty pleasures anyway
00:32:00 but like any sort of shame I might have had about something I liked before is gone I will
00:32:06 probably download Linkin Park's discography and give the whole thing a whirl by the end of this week
00:32:14 so expect to hear a lot more of me singing because there's some great Linkin Park songs
00:32:20 like there's some songs that come on the radio when somewhere I belong comes on or faint comes on
00:32:25 I still get excited so I know there's gems in that discography I just gotta dig them out you know
00:32:32 really the biggest difficulty of this whole process is gonna be when I have to go through
00:32:36 every album by all these bands and try to like weed out all the songs I absolutely hate
00:32:44 because more on that subject I'm also starting to try and adopt a a populist mindset as they as
00:32:50 they call it on on mute I don't know if it's a meme or if it's like a thing that people actually
00:32:56 study but like uh you know I I was recently introduced to the youtuber Todd in the shadows
00:33:04 I'd heard about him for fucking ever he's a he's a classic that guy with the glasses member
00:33:09 been around the internet for a very long time um I I can't stand that guy with the glasses
00:33:15 stuff so I've avoided him but now that I actually watched him he's actually really good and he
00:33:19 does these really interesting videos about pop music and what's most interesting to me about it
00:33:24 is that it's pop music and I hate pop music so like hearing someone go really in depth about
00:33:31 this genre that I have like no interest or experience with it's pretty interesting like
00:33:36 I feel like he's um giving me the opportunity to have opinions about these things or to feel
00:33:42 anything about uh you know a musical genre that I would typically avoid and it's really funny for
00:33:47 me when I watch his like top 10 and top uh bottom 10 of the year because I can't really tell the
00:33:52 difference that much in the musical quality I'm like it's all just shitty pop music but
00:33:59 nonetheless he can get me to care about it to even like root for a song or artist or something like
00:34:04 that you know um but in any case part of what's interesting about it is that he really goes
00:34:10 by song you know he's like a song reviewer he doesn't have album reviews the way that like
00:34:15 Anthony Fantano would and I've always been an album guy I've always been someone who sits and
00:34:20 listens to the whole album but in the last couple of years I've felt myself gravitating towards
00:34:26 like shorter and shorter albums because I don't have time to listen to whole albums all the time
00:34:31 you know and um part of it was also when I lost all that music because I've always kept just the
00:34:37 tracks I really like on my iPod you know like I'm not going to keep the slower songs on there
00:34:42 because if I'm driving which is why I'm listening to music on my phone then like
00:34:48 I'm not going to want to hear the soft songs so I just leave them all off
00:34:51 but like now there's a bunch of albums on my computer where I only have the songs I really
00:34:56 like and guess what I like those albums a lot more now you know like um Sufjan Stevens album
00:35:04 The Age of Odds I would consider one of my favorite albums and the album's like almost 90
00:35:11 minutes long it's long as shit and I don't think that it would be one of my favorite albums if I
00:35:18 listen to the entire thing every single time because I'm not that into the song like too much
00:35:24 or the song uh god even the opening track like there's a there's a few tracks from the album
00:35:31 that just aren't on my phone and so like I kind of forgot about them until like the other day I
00:35:37 was listening to the song the whole album on YouTube like to hear those extra songs and I was like
00:35:40 yeah I know why I cut these out because this is like an extra 20 minutes of the album that without
00:35:47 it the album's easier to listen to and I'm more likely to listen to it repeatedly and you know
00:35:53 hear the songs I do like over and over again so I'm really warming up to this idea of like listening
00:35:59 to singles especially because my fucking phone has it has this might sound like a lot but my phone
00:36:05 only has 940 songs on it and it doesn't actually take that long to end up hearing all of it you
00:36:12 know and because shuffle sucks and every time it restarts it just plays you every fucking song
00:36:16 you just heard again and even when you go through it for a while like you know a lot of those are
00:36:22 again whole albums so like yeah 941 songs might sound like a lot but that's really like if there's
00:36:29 let's say 13 tracks an album um less than 90 albums that still sounds like a lot when I put it down
00:36:40 but let's just say I've heard those 941 songs many many times you know I rarely update
00:36:46 what's on my phone I rarely take stuff off or put stuff on so I'm quite used to hearing all of it
00:36:51 and I drive a decent amount so yeah like I'm really in this mindset of it's time to
00:37:02 totally change my library let's get rid of all the songs I don't care about
00:37:06 let's put all the songs I like on and obviously not every song I like is one that I want to
00:37:11 listen to constantly but they do need to be on there you know like I don't exactly throw on
00:37:17 spirit they're gone spirit they vanished by uh animal collective when I'm like in the car
00:37:22 driving down the highway it's a very like contemplative alone at night song uh or album rather
00:37:31 so you know that one's going to stay on the computer but not likely make it onto the phone
00:37:35 but still you get what I'm saying and the reason it's called a a populist mindset is like
00:37:42 on mute they talk about how you know there's there's like rockists people who are into rock
00:37:47 music have a tendency to like really put all of their emphasis on the album um whereas people
00:37:53 who are into pop tend to put emphasis more on the songs and I do think that something is lost
00:37:59 by focusing too much on on full albums because I you know I watch Anthony Fantano's reviews
00:38:06 and sometimes he'll give like an eight out of ten to an album that is very consistent and very
00:38:13 strong in how it sounds but and maybe he feels differently than I do about this anyways but
00:38:20 like I'll feel like none of the songs individually stand out it's like a solid album at having the
00:38:26 sound it has but it's not an album I really want to hear all the time whereas there's some albums
00:38:30 that if you just take off a couple songs then all the rest of them are like the best song ever
00:38:37 you know like um acid rap by chance the rapper every song on it with the exception of smoke again
00:38:46 is like the greatest song ever written smoke again sucks I took smoke again off of there like
00:38:51 when I the album for like around when uh when I first discovered the album and uh I've never
00:38:56 had a problem it's always been like my favorite album I just kind of forgot that song is even
00:39:00 a part of it so like when you see it up on my my favorite albums list like just keep in mind
00:39:06 the caveat that I have forgotten that smoke again is a song on the album it's not even a terrible
00:39:11 song I just don't like it that much um the album lady gaga's art pop like manicure god awful song
00:39:19 take that off great album I originally had a few more songs off gypsy is pretty bad too take off gypsy
00:39:27 um but I originally had like Mary Jane Holland and uh what's the other one Donatella I originally
00:39:36 didn't have those on there but they worked their way back on you know it's not like I'm not open to
00:39:40 listening to these songs again and re reaffirming whether they belong on my list manicure is really
00:39:46 bad though that's an unlistenable song but nonetheless with all that stuff removed art
00:39:52 pops one of my favorite albums so I do think that there's something to this song based mindset
00:39:58 and I'd really like to get into it so aside from all that stuff that's been going on I also read
00:40:08 some comics yesterday uh consider this a response to Jesse's panel cast because uh Jesse started
00:40:15 up a podcast about reading new comics and he recommended some cool stuff and one of them was
00:40:21 Gwenpool which I like he was talking about it and he was showing the cover art on screen and I just
00:40:27 thought the character design was super adorable because it's like this just super bright pink
00:40:33 um very like anime-ish art style and I really liked it and then in the comments he had linked
00:40:40 someone he had he had linked someone a page of a batman comic but it was on this like comic
00:40:47 reader website and I was like oh hey a comic reader website I wonder if they have Gwenpool
00:40:53 oh they do oh Gwenpool only has seven chapters so far because it's a brand new comic this all the
00:41:02 stars are lining up just right so I read all of Gwenpool and it was really good um it has it has
00:41:10 these great it's a it's a comic that plays with the meta of comics in really pretty obvious ways
00:41:17 but effective ways where it's it's kind of all about Gwen Gwenpool like basically she she knows
00:41:27 she's in a comic she used to read comics and she she's like you know from our world and she's taken
00:41:32 into this world and it's about her constantly like well you know what I won't get too into it
00:41:39 because Jesse talks about it in his podcast but I will talk about what I really liked at the end
00:41:42 of volume one is that there's a shit gets real moment that was like really intense and what I
00:41:49 liked about it is that it was this villain who is sort of a goofy villain and Gwenpool doesn't
00:41:55 take him seriously because she's like ha you know you're you're that guy like why would I take you
00:42:01 seriously and then he just like vaporizes like her friend right in front of her and it was shocking
00:42:09 because the tone of this comic is mostly pretty light-hearted and upbeat and this is like right
00:42:14 at the end of chapter one and it was shocking but what was cool about it is that it's that
00:42:21 villain because like yeah to us who don't have to deal with the consequences of a villain a super
00:42:27 villain's actions they can just be goofy but like when you think about what is actually happening
00:42:34 in the comic that a person has been vaporized you know then it's suddenly like man even the
00:42:41 goofiest super villain is is murdering people you know they are actually murdering people and that
00:42:48 shit is rough you know and that's sort of what the lesson of the comic is it's what Gwenpool is
00:42:53 out there to realize is that you know shit is like for basically she sees it as this is a comic
00:43:02 therefore I can't take it seriously whereas what she has to realize is that for the characters in
00:43:07 the comic it is the real world and everything is as serious as it would be in the real world and
00:43:12 you know the comic is constantly drawing attention to how kind of shit it is to live in the comic
00:43:16 book world especially to the police force who are all just like they hate living in this town and
00:43:22 like why do we have to deal with this every day you know and uh that's the meta part that I really
00:43:28 like about it you know and I think that's really what the core of it is like there's lots of just
00:43:34 meta humor and jokes that aren't really that funny it's just kind of whatever you know it's just
00:43:40 kind of filler dialogue in a way but the actual core of the intrigue of it is really good um
00:43:48 and it's a lot of fun it kind of reminds me a little bit of the webcomic strong female
00:43:55 except the strong female protagonist is a lot more serious and a lot more like edgy
00:43:59 where a strong female protagonist is like a straight up watchmen thing Gwenpool is just fun
00:44:04 and lighthearted and like even though it has these like kind of deep biting messages it never
00:44:09 loses its tone of just like whimsical and fun um you know like when big things happen they tend to
00:44:16 happen in like pinpoint shock moments that are quickly over with as we get back to the fun um
00:44:25 and I like that about it it feels it makes it very easy to read and so yeah I might go and actually
00:44:33 buy the first graphic novel because it is out I believe um of the first six chapters
00:44:39 so in other news there was that Kickstarter that happened I started it probably over a week ago
00:44:53 it's up to seven thousand dollars an incredible amount of money um I'm extremely paranoid about it
00:45:00 because the Kickstarter the income of it is taxable right I I have to pay taxes on it and
00:45:09 everything's in my name with regard to this Kickstarter now the person who's supposed to
00:45:13 get most of this money is Jesse but in the process of setting because this Kickstarter
00:45:18 kept making more money I kept adding more goals to it and I added all these goals about uh
00:45:24 blue rays and like how we'll make and send blue rays and I think it's entirely possible that I
00:45:30 have way like grossly underestimated the shipping cost of shipping all these blue rays out and that
00:45:36 I also haven't really accounted for how much of this money might get taken by taxes so uh and then
00:45:44 like a lot of the money has to go to flying everybody down you know uh and having them all
00:45:49 here for a week so I don't actually know if there is enough money in the Kickstarter to fund everything
00:45:56 that the Kickstarter promises um so I'm concerned about that but we won't really find out until
00:46:03 it's all said and done like I don't know what it's gonna cost to ship all these blue rays until I
00:46:08 know what it cost to ship to each of these people's houses um hopefully most of them live in the
00:46:15 United States but you never know it's a it's a mystery to everybody you know if it turns out
00:46:23 all of them live in Europe then it could end up racking up quite a hefty quite a hefty fee
00:46:30 but it also could be that I actually allocated more money for it than I realize like I don't I
00:46:35 don't know it's it's a it's a confusing process I think I had initially set it so that each dvd
00:46:42 goal was like $500 and that most of that would be for uh for mailing but I don't know if that's
00:46:49 enough so yeah I'm concerned about that but at the same time hopeful because I mean the results of
00:46:55 it have been incredible you know that it was such a weird moment of like why didn't we think to do
00:47:02 this before you know because we just did radcon one um at the start of september and like radcon
00:47:11 getting it organized was a huge ordeal you know because it's it's six people all have to have
00:47:18 time at the same time we all have to travel you know everyone had to figure out how they were
00:47:24 going to pay for it you know hypocrite costs a thousand dollars for a round trip from fucking
00:47:30 england um you know we were pitching in money I paid like $120 to his ticket you know just to
00:47:36 help him get over here and none of us ever thought maybe our audience would just want to see this
00:47:44 you know maybe now I mean it would have been harder to prove to our audience what we could do
00:47:49 you know like what's great about the plebe and the weave is that we already had three episodes so
00:47:53 we could say hey here's exactly what you're getting if you pay for this you know but like
00:48:00 the results were so overwhelming that I really do think like maybe we could have done this for
00:48:05 the first radcon you know and we had all been salt like after radcon was over we were all saying like
00:48:11 this should not be a once a year thing you know this should definitely happen sooner we've had
00:48:16 too many good projects good ideas and we really want to start talking about getting everybody
00:48:21 into one place you know because ben and divu moved in at the time of radcon but every all of us
00:48:27 want to live in the in proximity to each other because we've all been saying all this time that
00:48:32 like if we all lived in proximity we'd get so much stuff done there'd be so many projects we could do
00:48:36 together you know we could really make things come to life and like the part the point of radcon
00:48:42 was to prove that and we did prove that we got lots of great content out of it you know we got
00:48:48 stuff like the potty cast live or ben's uh lecture which is ben's lecture is like a totally different
00:48:54 genre of video that none of us have done before or would have thought of but now that it exists
00:48:59 it's like this is fucking genius there needs to be more of this you know i'd love to do a classroom
00:49:05 thing you know as often as possible doing the plebe in the weave was something me and jesse
00:49:09 had been planning for years just because we were like it won't be the same if we're in different
00:49:14 rooms it just won't be what we're looking for you know and now that we have it it's like this is
00:49:19 what we've been looking for so you know jesse said pretty early on into radcon he was like i
00:49:27 clearly need to move down here because this is obviously the best career path you know uh like
00:49:32 if i want to have a successful youtube career i need to be around you people um you know
00:49:37 nate has wanted to get down here for as long as as long as i've known him you know but he's trapped
00:49:44 by um financial insecurity but he just he's finished school so he doesn't worry about staying
00:49:51 there for school he's just trapped at his job and as soon as he can well he's not quite finished
00:49:55 with school but he's almost finished with school and like once he finishes school um and then you
00:50:01 know has enough money that he could leave his job and he could obviously make more money if it came
00:50:06 down here so like radcon too is probably a lot of going to be planning for how we're gonna move
00:50:13 those guys down here you know and i would really love if like jesse and nate could get a place together
00:50:20 i don't know how soon we can even get hippo i don't know if he needs citizenship or like a work visa
00:50:24 or something but like you know if if we could somehow afford to have to have everybody move in
00:50:33 then eventually we'll be able to you know get everybody because i think someone like nate who
00:50:39 on his own content he spends so much time it's it's definitely hard for him to turn a profit
00:50:46 on the kind of content he's making where every single thing is a six month long project for a
00:50:52 45 minute video but he when he works with other people we get stuff out all the time and if we
00:50:59 were turning a profit on something like pcp which the pcp as it stands is a goofy little podcast
00:51:06 that's you know we we vaguely come up with a topic we all jump into a call we talk over each
00:51:13 other and it's a nightmare but like the amount of effort that goes into a pcp would not increase
00:51:19 that much if we turned it into a live show with a little bit more production you know if it was
00:51:25 maybe three people on a panel and we have a little set and we discuss a more concrete topic and we
00:51:31 do that once a month it might become something that's worth patroning you know if we had a
00:51:36 patreon for the pcp uh and if you know if nate had a show that he could patreon i think he'd
00:51:42 probably be able to be a lot more quickly successful than he's gonna get with these super long uh you
00:51:49 know video projects and so that's why i really want everyone living in one place because i think
00:51:54 we will all make a lot more money this way you know ben by all rights should be making more money
00:52:01 because i keep offering him uh art things to do but he keeps not doing them um but nonetheless he
00:52:07 does have the opportunity divu is obviously gonna make a hell of a lot more money living with me
00:52:12 because we can get videos done quicker i mean if he didn't live with me we would not have been
00:52:17 inspired for this 15 videos in a month thing of which six are already written so guaranteed
00:52:24 you know next month we are going to make a shitload of money like even if i don't write
00:52:28 any more videos after this point i've already got enough um that you know we will have a very
00:52:34 successful time ahead of us so yeah i think everything's coming up really well and it's kind of
00:52:41 it's kind of like i'm watching a bunch of plans that i've had for so long that have always felt
00:52:46 so far away suddenly come into sharp relief you know it's like all at once earlier this year
00:52:55 in around like uh the area of july to august like my channel suddenly spiked in growth and my
00:53:02 patreon suddenly spiked in growth and then my parents decided to move out and then we built a
00:53:06 studio in my house and then ben and divu decided to move in and it's like these are all things that
00:53:12 i always thought were going to happen eventually and then they did and it's like holy shit well now
00:53:18 it's time for all the other things that we've wanted to happen eventually to happen you know uh
00:53:23 when are we going to stop talking about getting nate down here and just get nate down here you
00:53:28 know when are we going to stop saying jessie needs to move out of his house and somehow find a way
00:53:34 for him to move out of his house you know like it could be happening soon and i feel like this
00:53:39 kickstarter really gave us the opportunity to start making those considerations that like
00:53:44 you know after radcon we were all like well i don't know when we'll be able to do this again
00:53:48 when will we once again have a thousand dollars to fly hippo down you know that's a crazy amount of
00:53:54 money but now we have it all of a sudden we have it now it's just like oh well apparently radcon
00:54:01 two is gonna be in january uh let's buy everybody's tickets and get down here and when we're here we
00:54:07 could talk about how we're going to make this happen again you know next time it doesn't need to
00:54:11 be a kickstarter it could just be that we have money you know maybe we're not maybe we're not
00:54:18 capitalizing well enough on how much like clout we have you know that that that clearly there's
00:54:26 some part of our audience who cares a lot about getting us you know getting to see us do things
00:54:32 together um and we should be taking advantage of it in a in the best way not in the uh not in the
00:54:41 way that that could be taken well i guess that's most of what's been on my mind i felt pretty comfy
00:54:50 on this couch this beer has gotten warm in my hand as i've been barely sipping it between long
00:54:59 sections of tirade but uh yeah this was a good way to decompress i feel it i feel
00:55:09 i feel like i just spent an hour on something that wasn't staring blankly at a spreadsheet
00:55:16 and blasting uh mid-2000s music that i used to listen to so i got done everything i wanted to get
00:55:26 done with this and i hope you guys enjoyed it i hope if you if you like this idea for a podcast
00:55:32 let me know um you know if you think this is something that you like really want to see
00:55:38 more of then let me know if it's more of a passive i don't really care this way or that yeah it was
00:55:43 fun but whatever then it probably i will be less likely to ever do it again but if it's something
00:55:49 that people are like holy shit this is a revelation in podcasting technology then i'll probably do
00:55:55 another one all right uh bottoms up have a good night of drinking and resting and uh let's play
00:56:07 out with some nice chilled out tunes
00:56:37 so
