00:00:00 Hello and welcome to the first and only ever Magecast! I'm your host, Mage, and I'm joined
00:00:07 today by Mage. Say hi, Mage! Hi! So, the topic for today is actually a YouTube user we both
00:00:13 are very familiar with. Her channel is Little Aurora, Mage, but that's a mouthful, so we're
00:00:18 just gonna call her Mage, because it's faster that way. Indeed! Anyway, so a bit about her.
00:00:23 We know that she joined YouTube in 2013, but this isn't her first account, isn't that
00:00:27 right, Mage? Why, yes. I know for a fact that she has had several YouTube accounts
00:00:31 over the years, but they were all abandoned when she grew out of the content she had made
00:00:35 on them. One of her first videos on YouTube was actually a crappy Naruto AMV, I believe.
00:00:41 She made several of those? Yikes, I built from that ship too, had I been her. But that's
00:00:46 all in the past, let us look at what she has been up to in the more recent years. But not
00:00:50 to every sin, let's start off by looking at her Magnum Opus, the critically acclaimed
00:00:54 collaboration video from way back when she did pony stuff. The lethal Halloween. Pony
00:01:00 stuff? Yeah, my little pony stuff, she used to review it. I don't see those videos on
00:01:06 her channel anymore. Oh, they're just unlisted, just go to her playlist on Mage page. Oh,
00:01:11 I see. Bit back to the half an hour long product of love and labor. But doesn't she hate that
00:01:16 video? What? Yeah, she keeps frequently telling people how much she hates it now. Any reasons
00:01:21 as to why? Uh, because it sucks? But Magnum Opus? No, she never claimed it to be. Frankly,
00:01:28 I can see why. The script is terrible, the voice acting often lacks direction and she
00:01:32 was too timid to ask people to redo their lines when she thought they didn't sound
00:01:36 right. Oh, let's not forget the main premise is just a rip-off of Danganronpa, a game and
00:01:40 anime series. The art? It's good though. Just barely holds up. Things got rushed there
00:01:46 at the end too, as she was late to post it on Halloween. Took her months to pull all
00:01:50 this together. Well, uh, we can still talk about it anyway. Yeah, sure, I guess. Well,
00:01:56 fun trivia. All the people who participated in this collaboration were politely asked to
00:02:00 make little videos to link back to this project. Most of them were little skits about how they
00:02:05 got kidnapped from their channels. Inkrowse had to pull hers down though due to the majority
00:02:09 of her audience being little kids who got scared by the collaboration video. Seriously. Yeah,
00:02:13 NKP never put hers up to begin with. At first she said she was just late but then she just
00:02:18 met. Oh, that's Rich, coming from a person who later asked people who featured for a
00:02:22 weapon of two seconds in an animation she did, didn't even animate to upload linkbacks
00:02:26 to her project. Yeah, funny that. So, this was back in her pony days. Three, four years
00:02:32 ago? Why does she up to now? Means. What? Means. Animation means to be precise. What
00:02:39 are those? Oh, people take snippets from a song and animate a character dancing to it.
00:02:44 I use the term animate loosely here as some settle for flipping an image or peg just a
00:02:50 slideshow. That sounds lazy. Sure is mage, but mage's animations are not that thankfully.
00:02:56 Hers take literally days to complete because instead of learning how to use a proper animation
00:03:00 program like a sane person, she draws everything on Psy and saves each and every individual
00:03:05 frame separately as a PNG to later be edited in a video editing program that is not made
00:03:10 to cater to animation makings. To top it all off, she has no clue on how to do fancy
00:03:15 effects on the video editing program. Nice. But yeah, so, final words on her channel?
00:03:21 Uh, give her a 2 out of 10. Needs more edge. What about you? I give her a U-Try Gold Star.
00:03:28 Good luck in the future, mage. Hope you actually do fucking work instead of procrastinating
00:03:31 by doing stupid things no one asked for. Well anyway, time to wrap this up. Thank you for
00:03:35 joining me, mage. You too, mage. It was nice. I hope to never do this again with you. Me
00:03:40 too, mage. Me too. If I never see your face again, it'll be too soon.
