00:00:00 Good evening everybody and welcome to the first episode of the Hyperbolic Wine Chamber
00:00:10 where I train my ability to complain. I am Tom Oliver and today I'm going to be drinking
00:00:16 Red Bull because I'm at work and that's the best wine I can have here. The Red Bull was
00:00:26 donated by myself or technically by the wonderful taxpayers of Massachusetts because I got it
00:00:32 with my EBT card because I am that poor. If you would like to donate to the Wine Fund,
00:00:39 the link is in the description to my PayPal and by all means request a specific wine in
00:00:43 the text field and I'll do my best to track that wine down and drink during an episode
00:00:49 of the Wine Chamber and of course I will mention you in the show notes. So today we are going
00:00:55 to be talking about Art vs Critique and I guess this is a bit of a follow up to the recent
00:01:02 as of this recording Procrastinator's podcast episode I don't fucking care because it's
00:01:08 late, it's currently 12.37am and I'm only half an hour into my shift at work. I've got
00:01:16 a long night ahead of me and this is how I've decided to pass the time is to do the first
00:01:22 recorded but probably not the first aired episode of the Hyperbolic Wine Chamber. So
00:01:27 we're going to talk about Art vs Critique and a couple other kind of retorts and rebuttals
00:01:33 and points talking about the latest episode of the Procrastinator's podcast. I will link
00:01:37 it in the description if you have not watched it. I suggest you watch first but you don't
00:01:41 have to but of course if you're watching this you probably already have seen it so for like
00:01:44 you know most people it's fucking fine. I wanted to start with my definition of Art because
00:01:50 the podcast kind of was centered around art mediums that we don't respect or art mediums
00:01:56 we think are lesser like the tierless or hierarchy of artistic mediums and the conversation kind
00:02:01 of had its ups and downs and there were points that everyone was making that I was kind of
00:02:05 agreeing and disagreeing with so I'm going to try and kind of go into that a little bit
00:02:09 but first I just want to kind of lay the foundation with my definition of Art and I kind of have
00:02:15 two definitions sort of there's like the literal definition of Art and then my personal definition
00:02:20 of Art and I will try to explain what that means as well. So in terms of if you were
00:02:25 going to like say like Tom what is Art like if that's your question I would use Scott
00:02:30 McLeod's definition of Art ever since I stumbled upon it I think it's well I may not like personally
00:02:37 sit down and describe everything within its context to my personal beliefs of what Art
00:02:45 is I think like when soup comes to nuts I can't disagree with it so I'm going to say
00:02:51 that like literally everything for the falls and sides is definition of Art and his definition
00:02:55 of Art is anything that isn't done for survival or procreation counts as Art and that's a
00:03:05 super fucking wide huge gamut but I think if anything YouTube and just the internet
00:03:12 in general and things that have become monetizable and become art forms I think the definition
00:03:17 really holds true that things that you know even like 20 years ago that we probably never
00:03:22 would have considered artistic or a pursuit that had artistic merit have been proven wrong
00:03:27 even if I don't personally agree that some of these things I would consider as artistic
00:03:32 I think are still art so there was a great it's in I think it's in understanding comics
00:03:38 the book that Scott McLeod drew because like understanding comics and making comics and
00:03:43 reinventing comics or trilogy of books that he made that are comic books that deconstruct
00:03:48 comics as a medium they're really good even if you don't read comics or don't care about
00:03:51 comics too much I was just kind of thumbing through them anyway because they're really
00:03:54 interesting but at one point he has this kind of these panels that describe what he believes
00:04:00 Art to be and it's his caveman running around and he's saying the caveman has like three
00:04:05 main goals is is procreation finding a woman because it's a guy a woman to procreate and
00:04:10 have a child with because that's like kind of programmed into his primitive brain seek shelter
00:04:16 from the elements and acquire food and drink to sustain his body those are the three things
00:04:21 that like instinctually drive all living creatures and his ability his desire to survive and he's
00:04:29 being chased by a saber-tooth tiger or something to that effect and he's running and running he's
00:04:34 like you know he's trying to survive this encounter so he he runs to the edge of a cliff
00:04:40 and then he jumps up on like a tree branch that's overhanging the cliff that the tiger
00:04:46 leaps at him and falls off the cliff and it's like this was an entirely an exercise in this
00:04:51 man's desire to survive there's no art in here so what does he do next does he find more food
00:04:55 does he seek more shelters you find trying to court a woman again but instead he kind of like
00:05:00 does sticks his tongue out at the dead corpse it's off off uh i guess off camera but not really
00:05:05 camera and then it's just the next panel just says art something as simple as that it had no
00:05:10 practical application in this person's life uh but it was a self-expression uh devoid of necessity
00:05:18 that is art so i would say as a baseline kind of like anything that isn't done under survival
00:05:25 can technically be considered art so even if i don't personally deem it worthy of artistic
00:05:30 consideration by my own personal standards i would say that that is a true enough kind of
00:05:35 like factual objective definition of art now in my personal opinion which i consider art
00:05:42 you know that's much more nebulous it's kind of much on a kind of uh
00:05:47 case by case basis like you present me with something and like do i find it worthy of my
00:05:51 own personal artistic consideration um it's more nebulous i guess to really define now that i'm
00:05:58 trying to actually sit down and like kind of spin it into a sentence or two i don't think i can uh
00:06:04 it really is just there there are definitely certain things it's tough because like to go back
00:06:08 into the main idea of what the podcast was talking about like what is art and what are my tears i
00:06:12 definitely have a personal tier list of things that i respect more in terms of their artistic
00:06:18 merits versus other things however something that was done consistently on the podcast that i don't
00:06:24 know if i really understand uh and this is a podcast that i really wish i was in on but i was
00:06:31 at work so i couldn't really do it um is that there there were these tier lists are being
00:06:38 mentioned by some people but i don't know if they were like trying to present them as objective
00:06:45 fact or if this was just personal opinion being confused with it because ben was saying some stuff
00:06:51 um i think hippo made mentioned a couple things um
00:06:58 but those those are personal opinions like i i could i could give you a list a tier list of like
00:07:03 things that i appreciate more than anything i think animation is probably at the top uh
00:07:08 then then it'd probably be books then comic books then video games and and and things like like uh
00:07:16 modern art and and abstract art and and uh you know like analysis and things would be at the
00:07:23 bottom in terms of things that have artistic merit but but that's just my that's not a tier
00:07:27 it's not like an objective tier list that's not something like these are worthy this is just my
00:07:32 interpretation my appreciation of these mediums in terms of ascribing them personal artistic
00:07:38 uh values objectively it doesn't mean anything and that's i guess that's kind of like the problem
00:07:45 right because like where does subjectivity end and objectivity begin or does it ever begin or end
00:07:50 i need to actually have some of my wine my quote unquote red bull wine
00:07:53 here we go so
00:07:59 where does one begin and another end and another thing that um that jesse said that i agree with
00:08:04 very much and i would have i was itching to bring up sitting there listening to podcast until he
00:08:09 brought it up was that um pieces of work are not necessarily confined to the slot that they reside
00:08:19 in and what i mean by that is like let's say i think personally that i feel that animation is a
00:08:25 more powerful and more artistically uh impressive to me medium than uh video games undertale is
00:08:34 still way more impressive artistically than a lot of animation i've seen you know like you're
00:08:38 they're not nothing is is bound by its tier list it's not like every the worst animation is still
00:08:43 more artistically valuable to me than the best video game there's definitely some overlap there
00:08:48 and that's why i think that the tiering doesn't really mean much um it just kind of says to me
00:08:55 that like you know if you mentioned the medium off hand like i have a certain amount of respect for
00:08:59 it just from my personal experience um as someone who's written books as someone who's attempted
00:09:06 animations as someone who's attempted and failed miserably at making games and as somebody who's
00:09:10 done illustration and podcasting i'm like i'm dabbled in a bunch of different things there's
00:09:15 subtle nuances to each medium that need to be understood and appreciated in order to do them
00:09:21 effectively and i'm not even going to begin to pretend that i'm a master at any of the fields
00:09:25 i've ever attempted to do uh even this podcast i'm probably doing a mediocre job at best but
00:09:32 there's there's mastery in every field even in things that i particularly revile or not even
00:09:38 reviles too hard word things that i don't find much particular personal interest in things like
00:09:43 abstract art you know like the jackson pollocks and the cubism and and shit like that that is
00:09:47 fine boring and uninteresting and vapid personally uh aren't some boring or vapid to other people
00:09:54 and aren't boring and vapid objectively at least i don't think so like what does the objective uh
00:09:59 value of art really mean and like going back to a specific example from the podcast itself with
00:10:04 pornography is a lot of porn empty and baseless well sure like it's kind of manufactured to be
00:10:13 low hanging fruit because it's appealing it's art that's made for the primitive mind instead of the
00:10:21 intellectual mind and that sounds really like fucking pompous when i say it out loud but it's
00:10:26 true right like like sexual desire isn't really a refined uh intelligent aspect of humanity it's
00:10:36 very like going back to the caveman example of how i defined art it's something that's been there
00:10:39 since the inception of mankind and to appeal to that you require very little you know because
00:10:44 it's not a very complicated emotion uh you want to fuck somebody so to make art that that stimulates
00:10:51 that part of the mind doesn't really require a lot of intellectual depth a lot of creative
00:10:57 endeavor you know like you you see something someone hot you want to have sex with them you
00:11:01 know it's kind of like that initial and emotional kind of visceral reaction so pornography to be
00:11:07 an effective form of art doesn't really need to be all of that uh crazy complexity like like it's
00:11:14 more complicated to to stimulate your intellectual desire or intellectual appreciation of like a
00:11:21 love story having two characters fall in love with each other and i'm sympathizing with their kind
00:11:26 of emotional play that's a much more complicated thing to do than to stimulate the primitive
00:11:30 mind of like i have an erection and i want to fuck something i can jerk off to this
00:11:34 it's it's a simpler desire so pornography i guess as a result is a much simpler art form
00:11:39 um is it still art for my technical definition yes uh from my personal definition i think it's
00:11:47 probably lower rung if i was going to rank it in terms of things i appreciate artistically but i'm
00:11:52 never going to deny that it's not art there is pornography in any medium is still uh a sub
00:12:00 section of the medium itself so like if someone's drawing like a pornographic image it's still a
00:12:05 drawing and has all of the artistic merits of drawing as a medium same with as a film same
00:12:10 with as a comic book same with any of that stuff like it's all using the same techniques that if
00:12:16 you replace those drawings of fucking with drawings of anything else would still be an art form so
00:12:22 well the the so it's not really the structure of pornography that makes it less desirable
00:12:31 uh or less valid as an art form i think it's the goal that turns a lot of people off ironically by
00:12:38 just existing to turn them on um because it doesn't aspire to much more than that right like you
00:12:43 know the typical plot of a porn the the the stereotypical you know uh pizza delivery guy
00:12:50 comes i can't before the pizza can i pay with something else like you know that's about as
00:12:55 complicated as porn plots tend to get but then again just to make a good example with alan
00:12:59 war's lost girls taking pornography to a whole other level that was done intentionally so it's
00:13:04 like how much of pornography being unexplored as an art form is because of culture because culture
00:13:13 really is still kind of on the fritz when it comes to to to porn and and human sexuality in
00:13:19 journal is still something that's very private i think probably with good reason for the most part
00:13:24 um i don't think we need to be super puritan about it but sex is a private thing uh you know
00:13:30 just by nature of what it is do i think there's more room in social uh commentary to to to address
00:13:39 it more to be more open about it of course um i think we've made large strides in the last like
00:13:44 even like 10 years of of kind of normalizing this talk and just understanding of sexuality
00:13:51 because it's a huge part of humanity and again it's very ingrained in the human mind so i think uh
00:13:58 artistically there's definitely more room for pornography to become to kind of like move beyond
00:14:05 its its stigma i don't think it needs to be as stigmatized as it is uh but i think like i said
00:14:11 because it's it's it's it's trying to stimulate a very primitive part of the human mind it doesn't
00:14:16 have to be very complicated in order to be effective uh so that's what i got on pornography i got a
00:14:21 whole notes what else was i going to talk about um oh i uh another thing i wanted to talk about
00:14:26 was analysis because analysis is kind of glazed over i got a lot to fucking say about analysis as
00:14:33 someone who did analysis for two years um like i mentioned earlier analysis is pretty low on my
00:14:38 rung of like things i have a lot of appreciation for i kind of get where ben was coming from where
00:14:43 he was saying that analysis can never uh surpass the work it was based on um i don't think surpassed
00:14:51 was probably the right word i think what ben was trying to say or at least what i was taking from
00:14:55 him because it was something that i kind of agree with is that analysis is always contingent upon
00:15:01 other art to exist it can't exist in a vacuum right you can't analyze nothing so in order
00:15:08 to analyze something something else has to pre predate it i guess was a word something something
00:15:14 needs to exist first in order to be analyzed um so it's always a reactive medium it always has
00:15:21 to be a reaction to something else and that inherently makes it a response and never an
00:15:26 initiation of creativity if that kind of makes sense um i don't know if that's exactly the best
00:15:32 way to to word it but there always it always has to come after something else and i think that's
00:15:39 what ben was trying to get at um the the the the red letter media thing he was kind of referencing
00:15:45 when saying star wars is a good example of uh the the analysis getting more kind of critical
00:15:52 recognition than the work itself uh though depending on the social circle you ran uh the
00:15:57 prequels are well loved by certain fanboys but something i wanted to bring up when i was listening
00:16:03 to that was the idea of analysis and cultural catharsis uh red letter media is a great example
00:16:08 of that how much of the the the reaction to uh that video was was catharsis right because there
00:16:18 was a long build there was a big gap between the phantom menace in 1999 and the red letter media
00:16:23 video which i think was like 2009 2010 something it was it wasn't very recent it was it was a couple
00:16:30 years ago but there was a huge at least i think a 10 year gap between phantom menace and the video
00:16:35 so there was 10 years of this like cultural buildup of like animosity toward this video like the
00:16:39 initially came out um i was like in fourth grade at the time so i loved it because i was a stupid
00:16:44 little kid but i'm assuming at the time there were adults who were kids watching the original
00:16:48 star wars watched it and felt betrayed by it felt that it was a letdown um obviously people feel
00:16:55 that way nowadays i'm assuming at the time there probably was a group of people who were too
00:16:59 so there was a decade of just like built up animosity towards this trilogy and how it let them
00:17:05 down and how it was just just a different approach to the franchise than the original movies so how
00:17:12 much of the appreciation for the star wars reviews and by extension analysis in general
00:17:19 is for the catharsis of having your your note your ideas um given a bigger outlet than just your
00:17:28 mind versus for the art itself um because as someone who did analysis and someone who's from
00:17:35 the bunch of people who do analysis and reviews and critique and stuff i can appreciate the red
00:17:38 letter media reviews on a technical level for what they're doing with the medium of analysis
00:17:43 even though i don't appreciate it as much as an art form but i'm sure a ton of people don't think
00:17:48 about that at all they're just like yeah they're sticking into these movies that i hate so i think
00:17:52 a lot of the love that eclipses the prequels probably comes from this just like jonesing for
00:17:58 the the fucking like verbal assault that they gave the prequels does that really count i guess
00:18:05 is my question maybe it does um but it seems like a lot of that comes from um the catharsis and the
00:18:13 feeling of oh i understand that and that's how i feel and and he's saying exactly what i want to
00:18:18 say and it kind of almost feels like uh you're appreciating it because you're seeing yourself
00:18:23 in it and therefore you're kind of like you're kind of pushing your ego into the piece because
00:18:27 it's saying something that you wanted to say and something you already believe versus your
00:18:31 appreciation for the piece itself um maybe another way of examining this point is talking
00:18:37 about um four panel comics that are prevalent on tumblr where they're like hashtags so relatable
00:18:42 you know when there's a character in like their pet and then life or some sort of life struggle
00:18:48 is personified and and shits on them or something and like all the reblogs like ha ha this is me
00:18:53 hashtag me and like people seem to there's like a huge backlash against those now especially
00:18:58 against owl turds comics on tumblr as of late just because they're so redundant and done over
00:19:02 and over again and they appeal to a very kind of base uh concept of like i'm going to point out
00:19:09 something in life that is common and affects a lot of people and you're going to look at it and
00:19:13 you're not going to really see the work itself you're going to project yourself into it like ha ha
00:19:18 this is me i like it because i see myself not because i appreciate the work and i feel like
00:19:23 analysis uh sometimes can do that as well where it's appreciated because of catharsis
00:19:28 and not because of what it is okay that went on a bit longer than i want i got five minutes left
00:19:33 to wrap this up before i gotta do my next round at work fuck um analysis and dependency uh critics
00:19:40 and laziness what am i even talking about with this bullet point um i don't remember
00:19:48 critics and laziness fuck i'm gonna have to cut this whole part out i don't even remember what
00:19:53 i was talking about these bullet points i wrote them like three hours ago fuck okay so i this is
00:19:58 like an hour and a half two hours later i'm cutting this in because i remember what i meant by critics
00:20:04 and laziness okay so this is probably gonna get me a ton of flak but i don't fucking care because
00:20:09 i think it's true and whatever i think critics too many critics fall back to criticism because
00:20:19 they're too lazy or feel they're too untalented to do the thing they're actually passionate about
00:20:29 that they criticize for example i think a lot of people who do video game reviews and shit on
00:20:36 probably really love video games and would make video games but you think it's too hard
00:20:41 or they're not talented or they just don't want to put in the effort to learn how to make games
00:20:44 because that's really difficult but they want to express their love for video games so instead
00:20:49 they talk about video games and i think because analysis is such a big thing and critique and
00:20:54 reviews and it's easy and you can make money doing it and it's become this big thing because of youtube
00:21:00 i think we're being deprived of a lot of people who make things because it's easier and more
00:21:08 rewarding short term to talk about things that other people have already made i think that's a
00:21:13 huge fucking problem and it's one of the reasons why i don't really do much reviews of media anymore
00:21:19 because i would rather spend the time that i spent making reviews making things
00:21:26 you know this is something that i guess this is kind of a personal tick that really
00:21:33 resonates with me is that when sometimes there are some people there are people who are legitimate
00:21:39 critics people who like actually want to be that and that's what they want and nothing else i think
00:21:45 digi is a great example just off the top man to somebody who actually legitimately likes
00:21:49 and wants to be an analyst i don't think if given the knowledge and the tool set to make anime he
00:21:57 would stop reviewing anime i think that's that that's his thing and that's what he wants to do but
00:22:01 there are a ton of people who aren't like that and for me personally that's what was kind of pissing
00:22:06 me off is that i'm talking about tv shows and i'm talking about movies and i'm talking about games
00:22:12 but i'm only doing it because i'm too lazy to get off my ass actually make the things i'm talking
00:22:17 about and that's what i was doing before i got into youtube was that i was putting my money
00:22:21 where my mouth was and where my passion was and trying to make the things i don't want to talk
00:22:26 about things that are cool i want to be talked about is one of the things that are cool that's
00:22:31 what i'm really interested in and i really hate how there are so many people who are doing analysis
00:22:37 because they're too lazy to put in the legwork to make the thing that they're actually passionate
00:22:41 about i think there are so many people out there who would be making movies who would be making games
00:22:46 who would be writing books who would be making tv shows who would be doing all these things but
00:22:52 it's just too hard so they don't and then they see people talking about the stuff on youtube like
00:22:58 oh that's easy i can just point a camera and talk about it and look the guy's a million subscribers
00:23:03 and makes a hundred thousand dollars i'm gonna do that and then they do that and we've lost another
00:23:08 creator to the simple easy returns of analysis and critique and i really hate me all you want
00:23:18 but i really think that because of youtube has made analysis and review and critique and commentary
00:23:24 way too big and has pulled people away from legitimate creation i think youtube is unfairly
00:23:33 it's almost too easy to make money with youtube and now too hard to make things doing things that
00:23:38 actually require effort it's like this reward effort is unbalanced right now you should make
00:23:45 more money quicker and and and more significantly when you do the hard work than the easy work but
00:23:52 that's not the way the system set up right now and i think that combined with like just lack of
00:23:56 confidence or lack of desire in people you know i actually want to make things and it's still
00:24:01 fucking hard and i still haven't done anything of any significance yet so i can't even imagine
00:24:05 someone who like doesn't really have that drive they're kind of sitting on the fence like it's
00:24:09 so fucking difficult but like the tantalizing prospect of being the next nostalgia critic a black
00:24:16 nerd or red led or media whatever just like like like just sitting there and talking about
00:24:22 shit and getting all these acolytes i just think if put in a vacuum and asked what would you want
00:24:31 to do if the effort and the money and the time was no object and you could just snap your fingers
00:24:36 and you would do one of these fields i think a lot of people who are involved in criticism would
00:24:42 say like like if it was no object of course i would make a movie instead of talk about movies
00:24:47 of course i would make a book instead of talking about books of course i would make a comic instead
00:24:51 of talking about comics and that's what's frustrating that's what i think so much analysis
00:24:57 comes from laziness too lazy to put in the time to be what you admire instead you're just kind of
00:25:03 talking about it that's what i meant that's just a huge problem with analysis and that's kind of
00:25:08 why for me personally i put it so low in terms of where i think it is artistically because i think
00:25:12 so many people do it for the wrong reasons and fuck that i want to talk about books because
00:25:22 munchie kind of tried to go on this fucking rampage about books i'm happy that jesse and ben
00:25:26 both shut him down because he's so fucking stupid saying that books are shit books are definitely
00:25:31 not shit um but this is kind of like i don't want to say a new revelation but something i was reminded
00:25:37 of by getting back into books in the last couple months um i used to read a lot in high school
00:25:42 and middle not even high school i used to read a lot in middle school and elementary school
00:25:45 by high school i was reading mostly comics because i think i had the same mentality that a lot of
00:25:49 people do and kind of maybe what munchie sounded like saying that like pictures are better than
00:25:53 words and that's kind of why i started gravitating towards comic books and manga away from uh
00:25:59 books when i was a little kid because i liked drawing i liked words but i also like pictures
00:26:07 and i liked pictures more so like this has words and pictures this has just words i'm going to go
00:26:11 with words and pictures um but reading again in the last like two or three years as i've slowly
00:26:19 started getting back into reading novels um there is a specific cadence and a specific tone and a
00:26:25 specific way of storytelling that books have that cannot be replicated in other mediums um
00:26:32 um books aren't just movies without a budget it's something that i think a lot of people don't
00:26:41 realize or don't fully appreciate is that a book is a very unique form of storytelling
00:26:51 because it allows a couple different things that i really appreciate the first is that you
00:26:56 can really get into a character's head in a way that you can't do in movies as much um because
00:27:05 movies have show don't tell uh books have show don't tell as well but you have to show by telling
00:27:11 which is kind of weird because all a book really is is telling it's it's like 300 pages of telling
00:27:16 but it's the way that you tell that makes it feel more like showing
00:27:19 it so you can get into a character's head and really understand their thought process and get
00:27:27 into their their their thoughts and their inner kind of workings as they go through situations
00:27:31 that you can't do uh in a way that isn't heavy-handed in film you can imply a lot of things
00:27:37 with cinematography uh to a character's inner plights and stuff but in terms of like a very
00:27:43 like direct line into a character's thought process books can do this more efficiently
00:27:47 because they're nothing but writing so you can like stop as you're describing something you can
00:27:53 describe the the emotions and the thought process going through character's head in between statements
00:27:58 because time flows a little bit differently right you're reading the book and and a book can have
00:28:03 like a page that goes through like you know five minutes of stuff or another page it goes to like
00:28:09 half a second as they think through uh a decision um you can't really do that with a movie because
00:28:16 a movie's running in real time consistently like time can flow differently but you as a passive
00:28:21 viewer are experiencing it in real physical time obviously because you're sitting watching the movie
00:28:25 so like if a character is sitting there uh think about something for a minute it's happening in a
00:28:30 minute of real time um and the movie's kind of happening in that time as well but if you're
00:28:34 reading a book um it it doesn't it it just it feels different um you're still experiencing it in
00:28:41 real time but the book allows for some reason allows that time to feel less uh disjointed i
00:28:47 guess um i guess also because like a book is right at your own pace it doesn't really have a limit of
00:28:52 like two hours approximately to really worry about it can kind of meander a bit more uh because page
00:28:58 counts are much less consistent than movie times uh but regardless you can get into character's head
00:29:04 just can examine situations and and really break things down more than you can in movies and another
00:29:09 thing that i really like is you can engage all of the senses more specifically than you can
00:29:14 in any other medium uh ironically because there's less sense there's less visual engagement like
00:29:20 describing things in books like visual medium is very difficult to do in books compared to any
00:29:25 other medium because there are no visuals like you have to sit there and describe things as opposed
00:29:30 to just showing it in any other medium and i would say that's books biggest weakness is that it can
00:29:35 also be considered a strength um from a certain perspective that like you can envision the world
00:29:40 however you want it kind of stimulates your imagination a bit more and i'd say that's a
00:29:43 useful thing but in terms of like like uh objective like strength versus weaknesses in terms of like
00:29:48 me as an author trying to tell you what something looks like by me having to describe it with words
00:29:53 i can never be as accurate as it would be if i could just show you a picture of what it was
00:29:56 so that's a weakness of books but on the flip side every other sense can be stimulated uh second hand
00:30:04 just as eloquently whereas something visually has to kind of go out of its way to kind of
00:30:10 tell you about it so for example if i was going to sit here and describe the room i'm in i could
00:30:18 describe how it looked like uh the room had a very ominous cadence because i'm sitting in an
00:30:23 abandoned building with nothing else in here one lighted room looking outwards through two windows
00:30:29 into a vast sea of blackness sparsely lit by a small light scattered throughout the large room
00:30:35 the the ticking of the clock kind of punctuates every minute of my time being wasted in here
00:30:41 not being able to do the things i actually want to do the smell of the air smells of oil and dust
00:30:48 and makes me cough it's so i can jump between visual stimuli and and like you know how something
00:30:54 smells and how something feels and then how i think i can do that all in the same kind of rhythm
00:31:00 without ever breaking the flow of how a book works whereas if a film wants to describe how
00:31:04 something smells a character usually has to say oh man it stinks you know and and very clearly like
00:31:09 kind of stop whatever else is going on and say this is what this send this this uh this sense
00:31:14 is being stimulated in this world because all you can do is see it um but if i showed you a picture
00:31:21 of the of the room that i'm sitting in i can much more clearly give you the visual information than
00:31:25 me describing it because every one of you listening to this saw a different version of the room and
00:31:29 none of them were exactly the same as the one i'm actually sitting in whereas if i gave you a picture
00:31:33 everyone's perception would be the same so books have strengths and weaknesses but the point i'm
00:31:37 trying to make here is that books are the are in work of art or a medium of art that is unique
00:31:42 they do things that know where the medium can and they're not just like shittier versions of books
00:31:46 or comics um that's all i got for this episode i was going to make some other points but i'm out
00:31:52 of time already late for my next round so this has been the hyperbolic wine chamber i've been
00:31:57 drinking not wine but if you want to give me wine for the next one link is in the paypal tell me
00:32:02 what you want me to drink and i'll go drink it if you have suggestions for the podcast let me know
00:32:07 till next time i'm tom oliver and i'll be whining forever because i hate my life i don't know how to
00:32:14 end these yet that's that's all i got
