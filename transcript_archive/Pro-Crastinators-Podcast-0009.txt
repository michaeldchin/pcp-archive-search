00:00:00 Hello, and welcome to this week's episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:04 We are back to talk about your favorite things one more time.
00:00:08 I'm the best guy ever, Guy, and I'm here with my internet dudes.
00:00:12 First up, Ben Saint.
00:00:14 SaintComics.com
00:00:16 Baby
00:00:18 Endless Jess
00:00:20 Yabba
00:00:21 Dabba too
00:00:23 Uh, Lethal Aurora Mage
00:00:25 I'm here, hi
00:00:26 And The Davoo
00:00:27 Hi
00:00:28 And uh, you'll probably notice if you've been watching that we've got a slightly different composition today of people
00:00:33 And we specifically requested Mage be here and Ben too
00:00:36 Uh, because our topic for the day is fan art
00:00:39 I have been derelict
00:00:40 He has
00:00:41 I've been derelict in my Pro Crastinators duties
00:00:43 Not as much as Mage though
00:00:45 Though that was because I gave Mage some shit
00:00:48 But regardless
00:00:49 You sure did
00:00:50 But regardless, all is well in PCP land
00:00:54 And we're gonna talk about this shit
00:00:56 Well, so right, fan art
00:00:58 So what we want to talk about, or what I was planning on bringing up
00:01:01 Was um, not really instructions on how to do it
00:01:05 But things that you should never ever do without my permission
00:01:08 Um
00:01:09 Well, okay, okay, that's one thing
00:01:11 The impetus for this was simply that
00:01:14 If you go, the links in our description will bring it to the PCP Reddit
00:01:18 In the bottom of the video
00:01:19 If you go there
00:01:20 A nice fellow did a couple of PCP art pieces
00:01:23 A couple of fan art pieces
00:01:25 That just got us thinking about fan art in general
00:01:27 And so we thought we'd take some time
00:01:29 Just break down what we like about, what we don't
00:01:31 And uh, you know, that kind of stuff
00:01:33 Alright, alright, guy, guy
00:01:35 So there's many aspects of fan art that we can talk about here
00:01:39 There's the aspect that a bunch of us do
00:01:41 Which is actually doing it
00:01:43 And then there's the aspect of getting it
00:01:45 Which is a whole different
00:01:46 Which is my exclusive side of that equation
00:01:48 So, right
00:01:49 And first of all, the first thing I have to say
00:01:51 Is that it is downright disgraceful people
00:01:53 That best guy ever has gotten exactly one piece of fan art
00:01:57 From Hippocrite
00:01:58 From Give and Take
00:01:59 And nobody else
00:02:00 So anyone watching this, stop right now
00:02:02 You're not allowed to watch any further
00:02:04 Unless you go draw me something
00:02:06 Send to me on Twitter
00:02:07 Do whatever you gotta do
00:02:08 And that's the end of it
00:02:09 Someone, someone did make a meme out of you though
00:02:12 That, that's true
00:02:13 That was um, a hyper bit hero actually
00:02:15 That's arguably fan art
00:02:17 Of a, of a kind
00:02:19 You know, actually two people have done that sort of thing
00:02:21 I guess that counts
00:02:22 But I want the drawly people
00:02:24 The drawly people
00:02:25 And, and uh, of course Cotton Candy did my banner
00:02:27 But that was a commission
00:02:29 So that doesn't count
00:02:30 But it's true
00:02:31 In any case
00:02:32 We drawly, we drawly people are just more valuable than the rest of you
00:02:35 Well, no, whatever
00:02:37 It's a sad truth of life
00:02:39 What about the draw I did for your video
00:02:42 For free
00:02:43 You mean um, oh for, for TBAP
00:02:45 Yeah
00:02:46 Well of course that was wonderful
00:02:47 But I just wouldn't count that as fan art
00:02:49 Because I asked you for it
00:02:51 That's true
00:02:52 Mage is a coin
00:02:53 Let's start with you Mage
00:02:54 You're asking people, you're asking people right now for fan art
00:02:56 So
00:02:57 No, I'm demanding
00:02:58 I'm putting a, putting a ultimatum
00:03:00 Do it or I'll, or I'll never do another video again
00:03:03 Uh, a guy
00:03:04 Yeah
00:03:05 I believe that your icon and banner and, and well
00:03:08 Like, you know, the face that you use
00:03:11 I mean, I did that for you
00:03:13 Unprompted I think
00:03:15 So I think that could just be fan art
00:03:17 Hmm, I, I suppose that would count
00:03:19 You could call that ascended fan art
00:03:21 It was just fan art to begin with
00:03:22 But then it, although, you know, I guess I kind of had the idea
00:03:25 That you might use it for an icon when I made it so
00:03:27 But it doesn't really count if you're related
00:03:29 So it's fan art
00:03:30 I can't remember
00:03:31 You probably did, you probably did actually
00:03:32 I'm, I'm, I'm a fan of guy kind of
00:03:36 True
00:03:37 Very critical and, and, and
00:03:39 That's true, you're probably my most critical fan
00:03:41 I think you're the most critical fan I have
00:03:43 Yeah
00:03:44 If you do in fact count
00:03:45 Which is, which is a good thing to have
00:03:46 Um, but, but regardless of that
00:03:48 I, I want to ask you and Mage, I guess
00:03:51 Or specifically Mage
00:03:52 I, I brought, I made sure Mage was here
00:03:54 Because she is by far the most prolific producer of fan art
00:03:57 That
00:03:58 Among our entire view
00:03:59 I would say she's the most prolific producer of art period
00:04:01 You think so?
00:04:02 Uh, close to it
00:04:04 Well, I mean, you're probably right
00:04:06 And so she's got the expertise that we need
00:04:09 To really crack this nut, you know
00:04:11 So, uh
00:04:12 No pressure or anything
00:04:14 Yeah, yeah
00:04:15 To crack this nut we call
00:04:17 The real America
00:04:19 Yeah, so, so Mage
00:04:21 You, you're into, you're doing a lot of undertale art
00:04:23 Are you still, still doing that?
00:04:24 Is that, are you still doing that?
00:04:26 Yeah, I haven't heard, I haven't heard from you in a while, so
00:04:28 I, I, I've been busy playing a game
00:04:30 But yeah, I am gonna do some more
00:04:32 Uh, there, uh, a secret project that's coming up
00:04:35 That's might be in a video
00:04:36 Ooh, a secret project
00:04:38 That sounds, that sounds sexy
00:04:39 So
00:04:40 Would that be on your channel?
00:04:41 Yep
00:04:42 Lethal Romage, cool
00:04:43 So, so what drives you, Mage
00:04:45 What's that core fire that burns in you
00:04:47 That compels you to produce?
00:04:49 Uh, specifically undertale or
00:04:52 Or, you know, whatever you're currently into
00:04:54 Well, I am currently into undertale stuff
00:04:56 I, I mean that in the grander sense
00:04:57 The thing at the time that you draw
00:04:58 That you are currently interested in
00:05:00 Uh, gosh, inspiration
00:05:03 I mean, I know that's such a go-to answer
00:05:06 But like, there are some moments in the day
00:05:09 When I just sit down and I was like
00:05:10 I feel like drawing today
00:05:12 And I don't stop until that feeling goes away
00:05:14 But I have to exploit that feeling
00:05:16 Because it's sometimes very rare
00:05:17 And it's just like
00:05:18 When you feel it, you have to do it
00:05:20 Because it'll, it'll, it's very fleeting
00:05:23 What everybody thinks
00:05:24 Sure, I know what you mean
00:05:25 Um, but your art is, is very good
00:05:27 So I imagine it takes you a very long time
00:05:30 To produce
00:05:31 Uh, I mean, does that like
00:05:33 Go away? Do you lose drive
00:05:35 As you're going along?
00:05:36 Um, most art
00:05:38 Just kinda like, it takes a few hours
00:05:40 Uh, I rarely like
00:05:42 Uh, put a piece of art down
00:05:44 And then come back to it the next day
00:05:46 Rarely
00:05:47 Oh, really?
00:05:48 Sometimes it does happen
00:05:49 Yeah, but usually I just kinda get in the zone
00:05:50 So it's good and good
00:05:51 You gotta do it
00:05:52 You gotta do it in one shot
00:05:53 Or else you might never come back to it
00:05:55 Yeah, yeah, exactly
00:05:56 Um, my favorite thing that you've done
00:05:58 I was just gonna say
00:05:59 My favorite thing that you've done recently
00:06:01 Is, is your Muffet picture
00:06:03 That's totally awesome
00:06:04 That's not that recent
00:06:05 That was like three months ago
00:06:06 Well, it's, it feels recent
00:06:07 I don't know
00:06:08 It was like her first Undertale art that I saw
00:06:10 Uh, I was just wondering how long that took you to do
00:06:12 Uh, probably a few hours
00:06:14 Uh, no, wait, actually
00:06:16 If, if, um, now I lost my place
00:06:22 How long Muffet took you
00:06:24 Yeah, yeah, okay
00:06:25 If you're counting the sketch that didn't happen
00:06:29 Then it probably took me a few days
00:06:31 Because the original sketch was like
00:06:33 A bit too complicated
00:06:34 And then it had like a perspective
00:06:36 That was really hard to do
00:06:37 And I tried to change it
00:06:38 But then I just scrapped the sketch altogether
00:06:41 And then I made a new one
00:06:42 And there we go
00:06:43 Okay, cool
00:06:44 I can weigh in on this subject
00:06:46 Yes, please
00:06:47 Ben is definitely our second highest fan art guy
00:06:50 I'm a very slow, I'm a very slow artist
00:06:53 And very often it takes me, like
00:06:56 Okay, a big piece that's complicated
00:06:59 I spend, I sometimes have to spend days on it
00:07:01 Because I'm just not fast enough
00:07:02 Or just not motivated enough in general
00:07:04 To do it all in one go
00:07:05 But, but, if the thing is coming out well
00:07:09 Then that gives you more motivation to it
00:07:13 Like if you do something and it looks good
00:07:15 You're like, yes, that's great
00:07:16 And that like restores some of your energy
00:07:19 And you can like, you can keep going a little longer
00:07:21 You know what's cool
00:07:22 Like your little successes build each other
00:07:24 But if it starts to look bad
00:07:26 Then it's like, oh god, forget it
00:07:28 Like if something goes wrong
00:07:29 I don't want to do it anymore
00:07:31 Sure, that's understandable
00:07:32 I was just going to say
00:07:33 It's interesting that you guys work in sort of
00:07:36 Like, I mean like
00:07:38 A piece of art is like one image
00:07:39 That you're just working on
00:07:40 And like crafting to make as good as it can be
00:07:42 And just the way that you were saying that
00:07:44 Like when I'm making a video
00:07:46 I don't know, like Digi I don't think really does this
00:07:48 His impetus is to get the video done as fast as possible
00:07:50 But when I get to like a complex moment
00:07:54 In a video, I'm sure Davoo can relate to this
00:07:56 And Jesse too actually
00:07:58 It's like, I try to frame
00:08:00 To make that as good as it can be
00:08:02 And like do all the little things I need to
00:08:04 Like a good moment for this is my
00:08:06 In the Gurren login video
00:08:08 When I did the like, what was it?
00:08:11 Like the alternate version
00:08:12 Or like an interpretive version of the spiral nemesis
00:08:14 Where I did like guts with all the waifus
00:08:16 Like I made that part really good
00:08:18 And just like you, I felt a strong desire to keep going
00:08:21 But then I finished it
00:08:22 And then it was on to the next one
00:08:24 And I didn't care anymore
00:08:25 And it was like, well, now that fire is gone
00:08:28 Just my jealousy of the 2D media
00:08:31 That's completely unrelated to this
00:08:33 Anyway
00:08:34 Oh shit, there's Wolf's Rain
00:08:36 Stray, stray
00:08:40 Wolf's Rain fucking rules
00:08:42 It does
00:08:43 It's got wolves, dude
00:08:45 I don't know
00:08:47 You guys want to talk anymore about that
00:08:49 Or should we shift into what we think about
00:08:51 I want to say
00:08:53 That when I make fan art
00:08:55 I don't do that much of it
00:08:58 But sometimes when something really fucking gets me
00:09:01 On a deep level
00:09:02 And when I really love a piece of work
00:09:05 And I want to like
00:09:07 I want to participate in its splendor
00:09:11 In some way
00:09:12 And I want to like feel close to it
00:09:15 In some way
00:09:16 So you fuck it is what you're saying
00:09:18 Yeah, I want to fuck it
00:09:19 Yeah, I make videos
00:09:21 That's how I do that
00:09:22 Honestly, it's not that different
00:09:24 From like, oh you like someone
00:09:26 You want to fuck them
00:09:27 Oh, I like this thing
00:09:28 I want to draw it
00:09:30 Sure
00:09:31 It's intimate
00:09:32 It gets me intimately knowledgeable
00:09:34 With the inner workings of a thing
00:09:37 And once I've done it
00:09:38 I feel much closer to it
00:09:40 Of their bodies
00:09:41 Sure, I feel ya
00:09:43 Like I loved Lisa so much
00:09:45 I was like, oh my god
00:09:46 This story is so
00:09:48 You know
00:09:50 Good
00:09:51 Touching or whatever
00:09:52 The story is so emotionally resonant
00:09:54 I was like, I have to create
00:09:56 I have to depict the final epic scene
00:09:59 Or you know, in Undertale
00:10:01 The fight against Toriel
00:10:02 I was like, oh my god
00:10:03 That moment is so beautiful
00:10:04 I have to capture it
00:10:05 I have to participate in it
00:10:07 In some way
00:10:08 I have to depict it in my own way
00:10:11 Ah yes, good
00:10:12 Yeah, that's cool
00:10:13 It's almost like
00:10:14 Right, okay
00:10:15 Now tell me
00:10:16 Alright, if you really like something
00:10:18 I can't be the only one
00:10:20 That if I really like something
00:10:22 I can get caught up
00:10:23 Just like thinking about it
00:10:25 Over and over again
00:10:26 That's how fandoms start I think
00:10:27 Just like mentally dwelling
00:10:29 On this thing and how much I like it
00:10:31 Oh yeah, all the time
00:10:33 That's when I make a video
00:10:34 So I can tell people what I think
00:10:35 And then I can
00:10:37 Gradually go to other things
00:10:39 Same, same
00:10:40 Well, I mean when you draw something
00:10:42 You gotta think really hard about it
00:10:44 Right?
00:10:45 So to draw a thing
00:10:47 To draw a fan of a thing
00:10:49 It's both an excuse to
00:10:52 Just sit there and dwell
00:10:54 On how much you love something
00:10:55 And just think it really hard
00:10:57 Like this thing, this thing, this thing
00:10:59 But it's also an amplifier for it
00:11:01 Because it gives you
00:11:02 You have to focus on like
00:11:03 Oh my god, this face
00:11:05 She's making this face
00:11:06 The tears are running down Toriel's face
00:11:08 As the hot fire burns around
00:11:10 But it doesn't hurt the fallen child
00:11:13 Because she's merciful
00:11:15 That's pretty heavy stuff dude
00:11:20 And that's what it's like
00:11:21 That's what fan art is like
00:11:23 And that's why I do it
00:11:24 What a good description
00:11:25 With fan material in general
00:11:26 I'm much more drawn to works
00:11:28 That expand on the context
00:11:31 Of the original or create new scenarios
00:11:33 Within the thing that are plausible
00:11:35 But aren't shown or don't happen
00:11:37 When seeing Undertale stuff
00:11:39 Where someone makes a comic strip
00:11:40 Out of a scene that happens in the game
00:11:42 I'm like, uh, okay, fine
00:11:44 You're like, okay, I already saw this in the game
00:11:46 Oh man, fuck you
00:11:47 Okay, I see what you're saying
00:11:49 But I personally am a much bigger fan
00:11:52 Of what Ben was saying
00:11:54 As a viewer of people dramatically
00:11:57 I fucking love all these
00:11:59 Incredibly dramatic depictions
00:12:01 Of fights in Undertale from the non
00:12:03 Because Undertale's fights are so abstract
00:12:06 To see them rendered in any other form
00:12:08 That's even slightly realistic
00:12:10 It's so cool
00:12:11 Like how epic was the fighting frisk
00:12:13 In Sans actually
00:12:14 All the fan art I've seen of it
00:12:16 Makes me love that fight more
00:12:18 Because I'm like, holy shit
00:12:19 This is so fucking rad
00:12:22 See, good
00:12:23 Who are you agreeing with?
00:12:25 In this case, she's agreeing with me
00:12:26 All the scenes in Undertale
00:12:27 Were obviously written around the fact
00:12:29 That they were going to be very minimalist
00:12:31 The more tools you have
00:12:32 The more detail you have
00:12:33 The different you're gonna write it
00:12:34 And when it gets all drawn up
00:12:36 It's not as funny or as interesting to me
00:12:38 When it gets all detailed and stuff
00:12:39 I know it's not as good as the fight
00:12:42 Of course, but it's a cool thing
00:12:44 It's a cool supplement
00:12:45 Like, again, it's kind of fanarty
00:12:47 Because these things did not happen
00:12:49 They just floated around in a heart box
00:12:51 For a while and died
00:12:52 Cool supplements are not interesting to me
00:12:54 Well, fuck you
00:12:55 I mean, as an artist
00:12:58 It's that feeling that I just described
00:13:01 Is what I get when I'm depicting something
00:13:03 That's in the game, actually
00:13:05 As a viewer, I'd probably be more interested
00:13:07 In something that isn't in the game
00:13:09 Like D'Vu was saying
00:13:10 Some kind of expansion of the lore
00:13:12 But that really comes with the risk
00:13:14 Like Sans' dating Toriel
00:13:16 It's gonna happen, guys
00:13:17 Shut up, man
00:13:18 But that really comes with the risk
00:13:20 Of someone overextending themselves
00:13:23 And interpreting it in some...
00:13:27 Going overboard in how far it's being interpreted
00:13:31 On this earth
00:13:32 Which can be really annoying sometimes
00:13:34 There is nothing on this earth
00:13:35 I hate more than unrealistic
00:13:38 Fan interpretations of situations
00:13:40 It makes me want to wipe out the entire human race
00:13:42 But did you guys play Undertale Red?
00:13:47 No, but I saw it on YouTube
00:13:49 Why is this?
00:13:50 I have not heard of this
00:13:51 Oh, you should play
00:13:52 It's kind of cool
00:13:53 It's really cool
00:13:54 And it's exactly what you were talking about, D'Vu
00:13:57 What it is is a single fight
00:14:00 It's like a single theoretical fight
00:14:02 From Undertale that takes place
00:14:03 Some time around
00:14:04 Like the time you're in Waterfall
00:14:06 It's a game, you play it
00:14:07 It's a game that you...
00:14:08 Yeah, yeah, but it...
00:14:09 Yeah, it's a game
00:14:10 But it's just one Undertale fight
00:14:13 But it's got alternate paths
00:14:15 For if you're a good guy or a bad guy
00:14:17 Or a genocide or whatever
00:14:19 And the fight can play out in different ways
00:14:22 I mean, it's a little like...
00:14:23 Yeah, it's cool
00:14:24 And it's a little dumb that the character in it
00:14:27 Ends up having a kind of a relationship
00:14:30 With one of the main characters
00:14:31 Who talks about her a little bit
00:14:33 Like she knew her
00:14:34 That's a little cheesy
00:14:35 It's so really great
00:14:36 I have no problem with it
00:14:37 But then again though
00:14:38 In Undertale, all characters
00:14:40 A lot of characters seem to know each other a lot
00:14:42 Like they seem to have a close-knit community
00:14:44 That's true
00:14:45 It's a balancing act
00:14:46 It's a small community
00:14:48 You just have to balance how plausible it is
00:14:50 With how cheesy it is
00:14:51 With how cool it is
00:14:52 And if those things are right
00:14:54 And it's acceptable
00:14:55 Then it's great
00:14:56 Then there's no problem
00:14:57 If she was the chosen one
00:14:59 And she's like
00:15:00 I'm the actual true God of Undertale
00:15:02 You have to beat me for the real deal
00:15:04 Because I was hiding in the shadows the whole time
00:15:06 And if it was that, that'd be more annoying
00:15:09 What I'm into is ambiguity
00:15:11 And subtlety in fan material
00:15:13 Stuff that isn't
00:15:15 This is where everything feels bad
00:15:17 In this fan art that I'm making
00:15:19 Because Undertale itself isn't always
00:15:21 Things feel bad right now
00:15:22 Things feel happy right now
00:15:24 Well I always look for
00:15:25 The first thing that I look for in fan art
00:15:28 Is an interpretation of the work that is
00:15:31 Porn
00:15:32 Oh yeah
00:15:33 Yeah
00:15:34 That's entirely true
00:15:36 That's what I'm saying
00:15:37 I'm way into pornography
00:15:40 Speaking of those sorts of things
00:15:42 You know what I think
00:15:43 Is a pretty good sort of fan art
00:15:45 The show Teen Titans Go
00:15:47 I love that porn
00:15:48 It's not porn
00:15:49 It really is a kind of fan art
00:15:51 For the original Teen Titans
00:15:53 And I think like fan art
00:15:55 It can be polarizing sometimes
00:15:57 Like what fan art can do which is cool
00:15:59 Is expand like DeVue was saying
00:16:01 I think expand on little things
00:16:03 That the fans are all aware of
00:16:04 That maybe the community is aware of
00:16:05 But the show itself doesn't really address
00:16:07 Like for example
00:16:08 My favorite episode
00:16:09 Hang on, hang on
00:16:10 My favorite thing
00:16:11 You know I don't think it's fan art's place
00:16:13 To really expand on the original work
00:16:15 Like the episode of Teen Titans Go
00:16:18 Where it's just an episode
00:16:20 About how awesome Raven's legs are
00:16:22 That's the entire thesis of the entire episode
00:16:24 And like people who hate Teen Titans Go
00:16:26 Which there are amazingly
00:16:28 Those people exist
00:16:29 I don't get it
00:16:30 And they see themselves as the vast majority by the way
00:16:32 I know they're
00:16:33 I hate them all
00:16:34 I wish they were all dead
00:16:35 They are scum
00:16:36 To make like a big
00:16:38 To big lampshade hang that thing
00:16:39 And make a big episode
00:16:40 That's a big funny take on it
00:16:41 Is cool
00:16:42 I really like that sort of thing
00:16:44 That is not an expansion upon
00:16:47 The original Teen Titans
00:16:48 That is a parody of the original Teen Titans
00:16:52 Right there
00:16:53 It blurs the line
00:16:54 I mean it is a show
00:16:56 That's a sequel
00:16:57 But it's not really
00:16:59 I don't like read fan art
00:17:01 And stuff
00:17:02 And then go back to the original
00:17:03 And go
00:17:04 Oh well all those pictures I saw
00:17:05 Are now a part of this
00:17:07 It doesn't
00:17:08 But they are
00:17:09 They are in your mind
00:17:10 My mind
00:17:11 Almost none of that
00:17:12 Really changes my perspective
00:17:13 Of the original thing
00:17:14 Look look
00:17:15 I'm not asking
00:17:16 I'm not saying that it's good
00:17:17 To change your perspective
00:17:18 I'm saying it's cool when fan art
00:17:19 Can just make you think
00:17:20 At the time of viewing
00:17:21 That fan art
00:17:22 That's an interesting thing
00:17:23 Yeah definitely
00:17:24 And that's kind of what I'm saying
00:17:25 The Teen Titans Go
00:17:26 Though fan art has like
00:17:27 The ability to make you
00:17:29 Like make certain characters
00:17:30 More endearing
00:17:31 For instance like an undertale
00:17:32 Grilby like
00:17:33 He's just a bartender
00:17:34 And he's like a flying man
00:17:36 Like I have seen like
00:17:37 A lot of Grilby fan art
00:17:38 And just like
00:17:39 The fan depictions of him
00:17:40 Has just made me
00:17:41 Like a huge fan
00:17:42 Of the character
00:17:43 Even though like
00:17:44 He literally says nothing
00:17:45 I agree
00:17:46 And especially when the fan art
00:17:47 Doesn't do anything to like
00:17:48 Depict him in a different way
00:17:50 It just kind of
00:17:51 Puts a spotlight on him
00:17:52 And it's like
00:17:53 Look at this guy
00:17:54 He's a fire guy
00:17:55 He hangs out at the bar all day
00:17:56 He listens to everybody's problems
00:17:57 He's probably a chill dude
00:17:58 And we're depicting him as such
00:18:00 So then when you play the game
00:18:01 Again you'll see him
00:18:02 And you'll be like
00:18:03 This guy
00:18:04 This guy's pretty cool
00:18:05 And like you know that flames
00:18:06 That flames school girl
00:18:07 Who's like the glue fire girl
00:18:08 She's probably
00:18:09 Grilby's best friend
00:18:10 Or wife or daughter
00:18:11 You know
00:18:12 I'm just making up things
00:18:13 But I like him
00:18:14 You think all
00:18:15 Hey you think all flame heads
00:18:16 Are related?
00:18:17 Yes because I'm racist
00:18:18 You know I can
00:18:19 I can see that
00:18:22 And I can understand
00:18:23 How like that kind of
00:18:24 Fan interpretation
00:18:25 If you like it
00:18:26 And choose to embrace it
00:18:28 Oh listen to Ben
00:18:29 Condescend on everybody
00:18:30 Shut up
00:18:31 You can give
00:18:32 It can give someone more
00:18:33 Like depth in your mind
00:18:34 If you want it to
00:18:35 Personally I feel much more
00:18:37 Comfortable keeping fan
00:18:39 Like interpretation
00:18:40 Like that separate
00:18:41 And I don't like to
00:18:43 I don't know
00:18:44 I don't like to think about them
00:18:45 I don't think it's
00:18:46 I don't think it's really fair
00:18:47 To like combine them
00:18:49 With the original work
00:18:50 I really think they
00:18:51 I don't know
00:18:52 Should be kept separate
00:18:53 Well but I mean
00:18:54 How do you do that
00:18:55 You can't stop people from
00:18:56 Making art
00:18:57 And I think as soon as you
00:18:58 Look at them
00:18:59 I just don't think about it
00:19:00 Like I never thought about
00:19:01 Like I never thought about
00:19:02 Vinyl and Octavia dating
00:19:03 When I watched
00:19:04 My little pony
00:19:05 And
00:19:06 I think what's important is
00:19:07 To like draw a line
00:19:08 Between your head canon
00:19:09 And what's canon
00:19:10 So like you can like
00:19:11 Head canon has about a lot
00:19:12 Of stuff and have fun with it
00:19:13 But when you're watching
00:19:14 The show or playing the game
00:19:15 Sure
00:19:16 You realize that
00:19:17 Like what you like
00:19:18 Is probably not true
00:19:19 But you can still
00:19:20 You know
00:19:21 Sure but these
00:19:22 You know more dramatic
00:19:23 Depictions of Grillby
00:19:24 Or like the sans fight
00:19:25 None of those are like
00:19:26 Deviating from canon really
00:19:27 They're just
00:19:28 People who are
00:19:29 Who are dumb
00:19:30 Who see fan art
00:19:31 And they go
00:19:32 Well this is canon now
00:19:33 Yes
00:19:34 Actually believe it
00:19:35 Oh yeah
00:19:36 That's a whole other angle
00:19:37 True
00:19:38 Don't understand
00:19:39 Those people at all
00:19:40 You know this
00:19:41 Maybe this can transition
00:19:42 Into what I consider
00:19:43 To be the big problem
00:19:44 Of fan art is
00:19:45 The self perpetuating cultures
00:19:47 Where people
00:19:48 Continue to go
00:19:49 To make the fan art
00:19:50 Not necessarily
00:19:51 Because of their
00:19:52 Original enjoyment
00:19:53 Of the work
00:19:54 But by the
00:19:55 Amount of attention
00:19:56 And friendship
00:19:57 They can get
00:19:58 From continuing to create
00:19:59 Fan works
00:20:00 Causing people
00:20:01 To continue to dwell
00:20:02 Too much
00:20:03 And get a little bit
00:20:04 Tired of it
00:20:05 Well I mean
00:20:06 That's an issue
00:20:07 That's an issue
00:20:08 And I think that
00:20:09 Definitely sort of happened
00:20:10 With Undertale to the point
00:20:11 Where I got sick of it
00:20:12 I was on board with most of
00:20:13 That point
00:20:14 But then I got confused
00:20:15 At the end
00:20:16 Yeah
00:20:17 I'm 100% on board
00:20:18 With that point
00:20:19 Davo
00:20:20 But isn't that just
00:20:21 Like what if
00:20:22 What if people made
00:20:23 No fan art
00:20:24 But just talked about it
00:20:25 Too much
00:20:26 Just posted
00:20:27 You know pictures
00:20:28 It's like the same thing
00:20:29 It's not like a fan art
00:20:30 Problem
00:20:31 And a thing
00:20:32 Explodes in fan works
00:20:34 And the whole community
00:20:35 Comes around it
00:20:36 The fan art perpetuates itself
00:20:38 Like Davo said
00:20:39 In a way where
00:20:40 It turns into memes
00:20:41 And the memes turn into
00:20:43 Dreams
00:20:44 Like people
00:20:48 Hopes and dreams
00:20:49 Yes that's right
00:20:50 Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
00:20:54 Okay sorry
00:20:55 It's the best song
00:20:56 In Undertale by the way
00:20:57 Hopes and dreams
00:20:58 I disagree but whatever
00:20:59 But anyways
00:21:00 What I'm saying is that
00:21:02 There's memes that spring up in the fan art
00:21:04 And that turns into
00:21:05 People's interpretation of canon
00:21:07 So you have stuff like
00:21:08 There's like 50,000 different comics
00:21:10 Of Sans crying
00:21:11 Like a fucking baby
00:21:12 Yeah
00:21:13 And he's such a nihilist
00:21:14 And he's so depressed about it
00:21:15 And people live
00:21:16 At some point
00:21:17 That kind of waned on
00:21:19 On our Undertale
00:21:20 At least back when I was
00:21:21 Still looking at it
00:21:22 Eventually people realized
00:21:23 I think as soon as people
00:21:25 Realized that crying
00:21:26 Sans was like a common thread
00:21:27 People got a little embarrassed
00:21:28 About it
00:21:29 That's good
00:21:30 Because it's self-awareness
00:21:32 Yeah
00:21:33 It's the whole
00:21:34 You know
00:21:35 It's like
00:21:36 That's like a huge
00:21:37 That would be a huge moment
00:21:38 Well let's just say
00:21:39 Hypothetically there is
00:21:40 A part in Undertale
00:21:41 Where Toby decided
00:21:42 To actually make that happen
00:21:43 For some reason
00:21:44 There was a lot of build up to it
00:21:45 That would be like
00:21:46 A huge payoff
00:21:47 And that'd be like
00:21:48 The equivalent of a character death
00:21:50 And in fan art
00:21:51 You could go all the way
00:21:52 You could make the ultimate thing
00:21:54 Happen
00:21:55 But then everyone would do it
00:21:56 And everyone gets sick of it
00:21:58 Yeah
00:21:59 On the subject of fan art
00:22:01 Perpetuating itself
00:22:02 By its popularity
00:22:04 I'm with you on that
00:22:06 And like for me
00:22:08 I even the things that I love
00:22:10 Like Undertale's like
00:22:11 My favorite game of 2015
00:22:13 And one of my favorite games ever
00:22:15 I did like one fan art of it
00:22:17 And then I wanted to do
00:22:18 A second one
00:22:19 But it turned out
00:22:20 It was turning out bad
00:22:21 So I was like well I give up
00:22:22 What was the one you were doing?
00:22:23 I was gonna do undying
00:22:24 The undying
00:22:25 I was like I did exactly
00:22:26 One Undertale fan art
00:22:28 That was pretty okay
00:22:29 And then I made another one
00:22:30 That was deliberately bad looking
00:22:32 And that was
00:22:33 I don't know about you
00:22:34 I make everything I do
00:22:35 Deliberately bad looking
00:22:36 So I can hide behind that
00:22:37 Like a coward
00:22:39 Exactly
00:22:40 That's my life
00:22:41 Exactly
00:22:42 That's my life
00:22:43 I actually do pretty pride
00:22:44 In my shitty art
00:22:45 But anyway go on Ben
00:22:46 Anyway
00:22:47 I guess all I'm saying
00:22:48 Is I don't feel the
00:22:49 I don't usually feel the
00:22:50 Needs to do any more than that
00:22:52 But if someone was like
00:22:54 I mean I did get a bunch of views
00:22:55 I got
00:22:56 I've gotten more comments
00:22:57 On my Toriel picture
00:22:58 Than I have on anything else
00:22:59 In my DeviantArt
00:23:00 Of course
00:23:01 I've gotten more likes
00:23:02 On my Alisa fan art
00:23:03 Than I have on anything else
00:23:04 On Twitter
00:23:06 Fan art's a good way
00:23:07 To get popular
00:23:08 Just to do
00:23:09 If those things were
00:23:10 Like super motivating to me
00:23:11 I would be tempted
00:23:12 To do more of them
00:23:13 But I don't know how many
00:23:14 More I could do
00:23:15 Before I started
00:23:16 To be like
00:23:18 Yeah
00:23:19 Yeah
00:23:20 What you gotta do
00:23:21 Is hop from fandom
00:23:22 To fandom
00:23:23 To do your fan art
00:23:24 Get that sweet subscriber money
00:23:26 I mean
00:23:27 Yeah I mean that
00:23:28 That's my natural inclination
00:23:29 Is to find something
00:23:30 I like
00:23:31 Do like one cool picture
00:23:32 Of it and then move on
00:23:33 Well good
00:23:34 That should work out then
00:23:35 Let me explain why
00:23:36 The whole fan perpetuation
00:23:37 Thing is
00:23:38 Is something that I find
00:23:39 To be
00:23:40 Not something
00:23:41 Something that I have to go out
00:23:42 Of my way to avoid
00:23:43 In regards to Undertale
00:23:44 Whereas
00:23:45 With my little pony
00:23:46 It's not as much of an issue
00:23:47 At least not for nearly as
00:23:48 It takes a lot longer
00:23:49 To become an issue
00:23:50 Is that Undertale is one game
00:23:52 In a hypothetical world
00:23:53 Where Undertale didn't get popular
00:23:55 But I still played it
00:23:56 I would have had a great time
00:23:57 I would have spent
00:23:58 You know a day
00:23:59 Looking at fan art
00:24:00 Then
00:24:01 I would have forgotten about it
00:24:02 Come back to it a year or later
00:24:04 And had an amazing time
00:24:05 But if
00:24:06 You let yourself get stuck
00:24:08 Sucked into the big community
00:24:10 You think about it day in day out
00:24:12 Every day every week
00:24:13 And so then you can't have that cool
00:24:15 Come back to it in a year
00:24:16 Experience
00:24:17 You never have to get about it
00:24:19 You know
00:24:20 I don't know
00:24:21 I rewatch pony episodes sometimes
00:24:23 And I found them
00:24:24 I like living in Undertale hell
00:24:26 Yeah
00:24:27 Well that's good
00:24:28 I can
00:24:29 I understand what you mean
00:24:30 Under hell
00:24:31 And I
00:24:32 I
00:24:33 You know I guess I would
00:24:35 Hypothetically have like to like
00:24:37 Forget about Undertale
00:24:38 And then play it
00:24:39 In a year
00:24:40 There's still time
00:24:41 It's gonna happen
00:24:42 But I never actually do that
00:24:43 I never actually go back and re-read
00:24:45 Or re-play things
00:24:46 Even if I really like them
00:24:48 Which is too bad
00:24:49 And I should probably do that sometimes
00:24:52 That's a healthy part of the experience
00:24:54 You know
00:24:55 It's like stuff like My Little Pony
00:24:56 Is you know half
00:24:57 It's mostly a situational TV show
00:25:00 Where things happen
00:25:01 There's new episodes coming out
00:25:03 There's a continuity
00:25:04 So it's something that can remain
00:25:05 In your subconscious all the time
00:25:07 Or it's something that you can always have
00:25:09 On the mind
00:25:10 Like ooh what's the character
00:25:11 Is doing this week right
00:25:12 That kind of sitcom
00:25:13 Yeah
00:25:14 Romcom
00:25:15 You know
00:25:16 Soap opera type stuff
00:25:17 Undertale is a single
00:25:19 One
00:25:20 It's a somewhat linear start
00:25:22 Begin
00:25:23 End
00:25:24 Story
00:25:25 So you have a problem with the fact
00:25:26 That people keep bringing it up
00:25:27 Even though it's done
00:25:28 It's not something that should be
00:25:30 I mean
00:25:31 I'm not following
00:25:32 I think ideally
00:25:33 Yeah
00:25:34 In terms of your ability to enjoy the game
00:25:36 It's not something that you think about
00:25:39 Consciously
00:25:40 Often
00:25:41 For like a whole year
00:25:42 Yeah
00:25:43 Now me avoiding
00:25:44 Me taking it
00:25:45 Well it hasn't been a year
00:25:46 Coming down
00:25:47 Well I'm
00:25:48 Well I'm just saying it's still
00:25:49 Probably going to be
00:25:50 Pretty around
00:25:51 A year from now
00:25:52 Because of the
00:25:53 Fan popularity
00:25:55 Perpetuation thing
00:25:58 Maybe
00:25:59 Maybe
00:26:00 Anyway
00:26:01 I'm not really agreeing with that
00:26:03 Personally though
00:26:04 I like seeing a lot of fan art
00:26:06 Of Undertale
00:26:07 Like for me
00:26:08 Me too
00:26:09 What I like about Undertale
00:26:10 Is like the characters
00:26:11 And I like seeing people's interpretations
00:26:13 Of like possible dialogues
00:26:15 And in between characters
00:26:16 Possible
00:26:17 Outcomes
00:26:18 Like what's going to happen
00:26:19 After the end
00:26:20 Or what happened before this
00:26:21 Or like
00:26:22 Yeah
00:26:23 Just sort of like all these
00:26:24 Things that are around the characters
00:26:26 I think
00:26:27 I love seeing that
00:26:28 I love that scene
00:26:29 I think that happened
00:26:30 After the end of the game
00:26:31 I think is the perfect place
00:26:32 To make fan art of
00:26:34 Because
00:26:35 Like all that is speculation
00:26:36 It's all
00:26:37 What makes the game interesting
00:26:39 Is like oh man
00:26:40 What's going to
00:26:41 They have a happy ending
00:26:42 But like what does that mean
00:26:43 It's fun to think about those things
00:26:44 That are really supposed to get answers
00:26:45 Within the work
00:26:46 But you know
00:26:47 Everyone's got their own interpretation
00:26:48 Of what that could be
00:26:49 And there is no answer
00:26:50 Well I
00:26:51 So it seems logical to
00:26:52 You know to pick whatever you want
00:26:53 I can totally say
00:26:54 That Undertale
00:26:55 Like that wrestling match
00:26:56 Like that wrestling video
00:26:57 Is the exact thing
00:26:58 That I would like to happen
00:26:59 After Undertale ends
00:27:00 You know
00:27:01 I forget what it's called
00:27:02 Metaton
00:27:03 Entertainment
00:27:04 Or whatever
00:27:05 You know
00:27:06 That's good stuff right
00:27:07 That's good fan work
00:27:08 I really like
00:27:09 I do really like seeing
00:27:10 Different interpretations
00:27:11 Of characters
00:27:12 Sometimes
00:27:13 Everything
00:27:14 Everyone has like a different
00:27:16 Idea
00:27:17 Of what she actually looks like
00:27:18 Because it's really vague
00:27:19 Yeah
00:27:20 Because it's in black and white
00:27:21 And like
00:27:22 I don't know
00:27:23 Like the hearts
00:27:24 Are the hearts red
00:27:25 Or are they white
00:27:26 Is like
00:27:27 You know
00:27:28 What color is the weird spear beam
00:27:29 Shooting out of her eye
00:27:30 You know
00:27:31 Like what color is
00:27:32 And like
00:27:33 You know
00:27:34 What's she doing
00:27:35 I don't know
00:27:36 Everyone's drawing of her
00:27:37 Looks really different
00:27:38 And some of them
00:27:39 I think are amazing
00:27:40 And some of them
00:27:41 I think are really stupid
00:27:42 I have this policy
00:27:43 For myself
00:27:44 Is
00:27:45 I absolutely know
00:27:46 That Undertale is good enough
00:27:47 To be a thing
00:27:48 That you can
00:27:49 Dwell on
00:27:50 All the time
00:27:51 Indefinitely
00:27:52 I just think
00:27:53 There are other things
00:27:54 To get to
00:27:55 Nothing's good enough
00:27:56 To draw on indefinitely
00:27:57 That all
00:27:58 Well until further notice
00:27:59 I guess
00:28:00 But I'm just saying
00:28:01 There are so many other things
00:28:02 That also deserve your time
00:28:03 For the first couple of months
00:28:04 I would have said
00:28:05 That Undertale was not
00:28:06 Overrated
00:28:07 It was
00:28:08 Correctly rated
00:28:09 And just there's
00:28:10 A million other things
00:28:11 That are underrated
00:28:12 Is my opinion
00:28:13 Um
00:28:14 I don't know
00:28:15 Um
00:28:16 Maybe
00:28:17 I don't know
00:28:18 Yeah probably
00:28:19 I'm not bothered by that
00:28:20 People can make art
00:28:21 Of whatever they want
00:28:22 Uh
00:28:23 You know
00:28:24 I am annoyed
00:28:25 But when communities
00:28:26 Obsess about things
00:28:27 That I'm no longer interested in
00:28:28 But I would never begrudge
00:28:29 Someone for the art
00:28:30 That they're making
00:28:31 I am off
00:28:32 Sensation and burnout
00:28:33 Are problems
00:28:34 Yeah
00:28:35 Yeah
00:28:36 I am often
00:28:37 Perterrived by the thought
00:28:38 That there's probably
00:28:39 Lots of really great
00:28:40 Emotionally affecting media
00:28:41 Out there
00:28:42 That I'll never find
00:28:43 Sure
00:28:44 That I haven't found yet
00:28:45 And I never will
00:28:46 And that's very troubling to me
00:28:48 Um
00:28:49 That brings me to another
00:28:50 Thing about fan art
00:28:51 Which is
00:28:52 Um
00:28:53 That it kind of brings
00:28:54 Attention to a thing
00:28:55 Yeah
00:28:56 Like the way
00:28:57 That I found out about
00:28:58 Homestuck
00:28:59 Was through
00:29:00 You know art of the trolls
00:29:01 Or not
00:29:02 Actually it was mostly
00:29:03 Screenshots of the trolls
00:29:04 That I would see
00:29:05 As people's avatars
00:29:06 And stuff
00:29:07 But whatever
00:29:08 And like
00:29:09 Rainbow Dash presents
00:29:10 The
00:29:11 The biker gorilla
00:29:12 Named episode
00:29:13 Rainbow Dash presents
00:29:14 Her pussy
00:29:15 To be cummed inside
00:29:16 Am I right?
00:29:17 Anyway
00:29:18 Yeah
00:29:19 And I
00:29:20 A friend of mine
00:29:21 Made me watch that
00:29:22 The one with the
00:29:23 Rainbow Factory
00:29:24 Made you watch
00:29:25 Rainbow Dash get cummed inside
00:29:26 Okay
00:29:27 Before
00:29:28 Making me watch an episode
00:29:29 Gave you the opportunity
00:29:30 He said it
00:29:31 Instead of
00:29:32 Making me watch an episode
00:29:33 My friend
00:29:34 Made me watch
00:29:35 The Rainbow Dash presents
00:29:36 The rainbow factory thing
00:29:37 And that
00:29:38 Made me
00:29:39 More interested
00:29:40 In the show
00:29:41 Is the rainbow factory
00:29:42 What she calls her pussy?
00:29:44 Then the consecutive episodes
00:29:46 That I watched
00:29:47 Of my little pony afterwards
00:29:48 Because of the fact
00:29:49 That it was this
00:29:50 20 minute
00:29:51 Production
00:29:52 Or is it her bottle?
00:29:54 This 20 minutes
00:29:56 Why don't I fucking kill you?
00:29:58 Holy fucking shit
00:29:59 Slide show story
00:30:01 About all this meta stuff
00:30:03 I wasn't able to follow
00:30:04 And I was like
00:30:05 Man
00:30:06 If it's able to inspire
00:30:07 In people
00:30:08 This much effort
00:30:09 For something they're not
00:30:10 Gonna make any money off of
00:30:11 It must be good
00:30:12 So it wasn't just advertising
00:30:14 It really sold me
00:30:15 On the passion
00:30:16 That people had
00:30:17 You know what's interesting though
00:30:18 Yeah
00:30:19 That's Sam's
00:30:20 Stronger than you parody
00:30:21 Last time I checked
00:30:22 Over 5 million views
00:30:23 And that's like
00:30:24 Only one of the variations
00:30:25 I think that's like
00:30:26 The animated one
00:30:27 I mean
00:30:28 There's no way
00:30:29 5 million people have played
00:30:30 Undertale right
00:30:31 There's an entire subgenre
00:30:32 Of stronger than you
00:30:33 Mashup parodies
00:30:34 With Undertale specifically
00:30:35 Yeah
00:30:36 But like
00:30:37 The fan work
00:30:38 Has eclipsed the game
00:30:39 At this point
00:30:40 Clearly
00:30:41 There's no way 5 million people
00:30:42 Bought that game and played it
00:30:43 You are probably right
00:30:44 Yeah
00:30:45 A lot of them could be
00:30:46 Just rewatches as well
00:30:47 Okay true
00:30:48 True
00:30:49 But I doubt even
00:30:50 1 million people played
00:30:51 Wouldn't that be like
00:30:52 Crazy successful
00:30:53 I mean
00:30:54 Guy
00:30:55 Yeah
00:30:56 I will agree with you
00:30:57 That there is probably
00:30:58 A contingent
00:30:59 I don't know how large
00:31:00 I'm not complaining
00:31:01 By the way
00:31:02 I'm just pointing it out
00:31:03 That do
00:31:04 Or at least
00:31:05 That do
00:31:06 And or enjoy
00:31:07 Undertale fan shit
00:31:08 And haven't actually
00:31:09 Played Undertale
00:31:10 Yeah
00:31:11 There's probably
00:31:12 Quite a few
00:31:13 Just like there were people
00:31:14 That did homestuck
00:31:15 Fan shit
00:31:16 And they never read
00:31:17 Homestuck
00:31:18 True
00:31:19 I know
00:31:20 Those people have a
00:31:21 Slightly better excuse
00:31:22 Though
00:31:23 No
00:31:24 They should be
00:31:25 In hell
00:31:26 Well okay
00:31:27 You can say they're
00:31:28 Equally bad
00:31:29 Sure
00:31:30 On days like that
00:31:31 Guy
00:31:32 Kids like them
00:31:33 Should be burning
00:31:34 I think I've ever heard
00:31:35 So well done
00:31:36 Well done
00:31:37 Everyone else never
00:31:38 Say it again
00:31:39 It's really annoying
00:31:40 So I mean
00:31:41 We could now
00:31:42 Shift into
00:31:44 We've talked about that
00:31:45 For a while
00:31:46 How about we now complain
00:31:47 About the other side
00:31:48 Receiving fan art
00:31:49 And how everyone's
00:31:50 Doing it wrong
00:31:51 Or not doing it enough
00:31:52 Let me tell you
00:31:53 Assholes
00:31:54 Yeah
00:31:55 And I think
00:31:56 Mage can relate to this
00:31:57 A story
00:31:58 I like
00:32:00 Doing fan art
00:32:01 And giving it to people
00:32:03 I have given a couple
00:32:04 Of favorite artists of mine
00:32:05 On Twitter
00:32:06 Some fan art
00:32:07 Oh yes
00:32:08 And I have gotten
00:32:09 Like retweeted from them
00:32:10 And like
00:32:11 You know they've said
00:32:12 They liked it and stuff
00:32:13 Which was very nice
00:32:14 Did the Lisa guy retweet
00:32:15 Your thing
00:32:16 Yes
00:32:17 The guy who made
00:32:18 Lisa retweeted
00:32:19 My picture
00:32:20 Who by the way
00:32:21 Is a Nordic god
00:32:22 He's the most beautiful
00:32:23 Man in the world
00:32:24 And a karate master
00:32:25 That's right
00:32:26 But
00:32:27 Yeah he retweeted it
00:32:28 And as well he should
00:32:29 Because that piece was
00:32:30 Fucking awesome
00:32:31 And it got like
00:32:32 Very good
00:32:33 Because I did one of her
00:32:34 Characters
00:32:35 And I did one from
00:32:36 Katie Rice
00:32:37 I drew her characters
00:32:38 Camp we don't want you
00:32:39 Camp we don't want you
00:32:40 Yeah
00:32:41 From Katie
00:32:42 And
00:32:43 It's
00:32:44 Nice
00:32:45 Because being an artist
00:32:46 Myself
00:32:47 I know
00:32:48 That fan art
00:32:49 Of my own characters
00:32:50 Is the most precious thing
00:32:52 Yeah
00:32:53 It's the most valuable commodity
00:32:54 Other than money
00:32:55 And it's even pretty close
00:32:57 To that
00:32:58 Because like
00:32:59 That's how you know
00:33:00 A thing is popular
00:33:01 That's the fan art of it
00:33:02 It inspires people
00:33:03 Yeah
00:33:04 So if fan art of your stuff
00:33:06 Exists
00:33:07 And is being made
00:33:08 You need to fucking
00:33:09 Foster that
00:33:10 You need to like
00:33:11 You need to like
00:33:12 You know try and kindle that
00:33:13 Because that's
00:33:14 That's how
00:33:15 That's one of the ways
00:33:16 By which you
00:33:17 Propagate
00:33:18 So
00:33:19 Yes
00:33:20 I made some
00:33:21 And gave it to people
00:33:22 Because I knew they would
00:33:23 Like it
00:33:24 Because I would
00:33:25 Like it
00:33:26 And it was true
00:33:27 Remember the time
00:33:28 Way back in the day
00:33:29 Ben
00:33:30 The first ever piece
00:33:31 Of fan art
00:33:32 That I put into that
00:33:33 Big intro
00:33:34 Celebrating it
00:33:35 That's
00:33:36 That's
00:33:37 That was a great
00:33:38 A more innocent time
00:33:39 That was a great day
00:33:40 It was a great day
00:33:41 And then given of course
00:33:42 Put us into a video
00:33:43 I think shortly after that
00:33:44 Which was
00:33:45 That was probably a while later
00:33:46 Man
00:33:47 Man it feels good
00:33:48 To be a
00:33:49 YouTube gangster
00:33:50 Anyway David
00:33:51 What were you saying
00:33:52 Oh
00:33:53 I think that
00:33:54 If the apocalypse happens
00:33:55 If the apocalypse happens
00:33:57 What if fan artists
00:33:59 Are
00:34:00 Fan arts like the
00:34:01 Like the most valued
00:34:02 Commodity
00:34:03 You can draw
00:34:04 Like a bottle caps and fallout
00:34:05 Or something
00:34:06 DeVoo
00:34:07 Yeah
00:34:08 DeVoo have you played Lisa
00:34:09 Is that what happens in Lisa
00:34:10 That happens in Lisa
00:34:11 What
00:34:12 There's
00:34:13 Because it's the post
00:34:14 Apocalypse
00:34:15 And all the women are dead
00:34:16 So porn
00:34:17 Becomes the most
00:34:18 Precious commodity
00:34:19 Like porn
00:34:20 Is money
00:34:21 In Lisa
00:34:22 Whoa it's awesome
00:34:23 Yeah your money
00:34:24 Your money is mags
00:34:25 As in nudie magazines
00:34:26 And you have to trade for them
00:34:28 Yeah
00:34:29 But like
00:34:30 One of your party members
00:34:31 Is this
00:34:32 He's an artist
00:34:33 And just like
00:34:34 He like
00:34:35 Draws porn
00:34:36 And that's
00:34:37 Oh man
00:34:38 He's drawing money
00:34:39 Making it good living
00:34:40 Yeah he prints money
00:34:41 Awesome
00:34:42 But he's actually a really shitty party member
00:34:43 And his design is really shitty
00:34:44 And Mary Sue
00:34:45 Well
00:34:46 Because he was a fan
00:34:47 He was like a kickstarter reward
00:34:48 Oh really
00:34:49 Okay
00:34:50 Well that's
00:34:51 Oh that's a whole other subject
00:34:52 We should probably get into
00:34:53 But anyway
00:34:54 Yeah
00:34:55 We could do that
00:34:56 But what's that DeVoo
00:34:57 Kickstarter rewards
00:34:58 But the artist
00:34:59 Putting a fan made thing
00:35:01 Into the real thing
00:35:02 Okay man
00:35:03 I was watching this one
00:35:04 Undertale video
00:35:05 Wait
00:35:06 Muffet
00:35:07 Muffet's great
00:35:08 Wait are you saying Muffet
00:35:09 Was introduced outside
00:35:10 By a
00:35:11 Well she's the objectively best character
00:35:12 In this series
00:35:13 So obviously that redeems
00:35:14 The whole thing
00:35:15 Right guys shut up
00:35:16 Everyone
00:35:17 Explain what you mean
00:35:18 What do you mean about Muffet
00:35:19 Well she was a
00:35:20 Kickstarter
00:35:21 Thing
00:35:22 Right it was like
00:35:23 There'll be one
00:35:24 Kickstarter character
00:35:25 Made by a fan
00:35:26 Who can design her
00:35:27 Or it
00:35:28 233
00:35:29 What no
00:35:30 What a great
00:35:31 That was so sorry
00:35:32 There was so sorry
00:35:33 What's his face in the
00:35:35 Flying thing
00:35:36 Oh yeah
00:35:37 And Muffet
00:35:38 Muffet was the best
00:35:39 The flying thing
00:35:40 Are you talking about
00:35:41 Sunderplane
00:35:42 No no no
00:35:43 What flying thing
00:35:44 The other one
00:35:45 I forgot its name
00:35:46 Is he a boss
00:35:47 Like he's kinda hard to find
00:35:48 Sort of like
00:35:49 Is he a whale
00:35:50 Yeah he's kinda like
00:35:51 A flying whale thing
00:35:52 And he's like
00:35:53 I see
00:35:54 What
00:35:55 He's pretending to be
00:35:57 Cool or whatever
00:35:58 I don't remember
00:35:59 Like Glide
00:36:00 I think
00:36:01 Geez I never found this guy
00:36:03 Yeah he's
00:36:04 I've seen pictures of him
00:36:05 He's encountered
00:36:06 Before Papyrus's battle
00:36:07 In that
00:36:08 Area where
00:36:09 It was a locked door
00:36:11 Yeah
00:36:12 If you run around
00:36:13 For a million years
00:36:14 You'll fight him
00:36:15 Which is what happened to me
00:36:16 Because I was trying to
00:36:17 Open that door
00:36:18 Yeah and he's
00:36:19 Really hard as well
00:36:20 Holy shit
00:36:21 I've never seen this guy
00:36:22 Just looked him up
00:36:23 What the fuck
00:36:24 So Glide so sorry
00:36:25 And Muffet
00:36:26 Are rewards
00:36:27 And Muffet
00:36:28 I know for sure
00:36:29 That she was definitely a reward
00:36:30 Because she was
00:36:31 Designed by the artist
00:36:33 Who is making a comic
00:36:35 Called Avis Demon
00:36:36 I'm a fan of that comic as well
00:36:37 She's a brilliant artist
00:36:39 Like her art
00:36:40 Is just wow
00:36:41 And how
00:36:42 Toby utilized
00:36:43 What a mind blow
00:36:44 The Muffet's design
00:36:45 Was pretty great
00:36:46 Because he
00:36:47 Yeah with the whole
00:36:48 Spiders thing
00:36:49 He created this whole
00:36:50 Subculture
00:36:51 Within the world
00:36:52 Which made it feel
00:36:53 Realistic man
00:36:54 That really makes me wonder
00:36:56 Whether she was
00:36:58 Designed before the demo
00:36:59 Because even in the demo
00:37:00 There were the
00:37:01 Spiders in the bake sale
00:37:02 I see
00:37:03 So maybe she was
00:37:04 Trying to extrapolate
00:37:05 Off of that
00:37:06 She was like
00:37:07 Ooh I'll make a spider
00:37:08 And then Toby realized
00:37:09 Ooh I could have a payoff
00:37:10 To this whole spider situation
00:37:11 Maybe they work together
00:37:12 That's a genius
00:37:13 Like I always thought
00:37:14 It was kind of funny
00:37:15 That I mean
00:37:16 Muffet really kind of
00:37:17 Comes out of nowhere
00:37:18 She's in the middle of
00:37:19 Hotland
00:37:20 Like right in between
00:37:21 Like the mediton sections
00:37:22 Not only there for like
00:37:23 A brief time
00:37:24 And that's like
00:37:25 One of my favorite parts
00:37:26 In the whole game
00:37:27 But man
00:37:28 Like all the work
00:37:29 He put into that
00:37:30 Jesus Christ
00:37:31 Did this person pay
00:37:32 For like a boss fight
00:37:33 And a character
00:37:34 Like and
00:37:35 Ties to the story
00:37:36 Jesus that's
00:37:37 That's a lot of shit
00:37:38 And anyway
00:37:39 It doesn't matter
00:37:40 Well I mean so sorry
00:37:41 Has a boss fight
00:37:42 Right
00:37:43 And his own little
00:37:44 Area
00:37:45 And his own little like
00:37:46 I don't know
00:37:47 Coated into the game
00:37:48 But he's like
00:37:49 Hidden away
00:37:50 Yeah
00:37:51 So
00:37:52 Okay so of those
00:37:53 Glyde looks cool
00:37:54 Muffet is the best character
00:37:56 And so sorry
00:37:57 Is the worst thing
00:37:58 That's ever happened
00:37:59 Oh each shit
00:38:00 Each shit guy
00:38:01 So sorry he's fine
00:38:02 He's fine
00:38:03 I mean look at
00:38:04 He's like the butter dragon
00:38:05 You ever go look at this guy's art
00:38:06 Yeah so fucking what
00:38:07 So he's ugly
00:38:08 And whatever
00:38:09 He's a nightmare
00:38:10 He looks like
00:38:11 Like a rejected Barney character
00:38:12 He's a fucking comedy
00:38:13 Character you piece of shit
00:38:14 Well
00:38:15 I'm laughing
00:38:16 Guys
00:38:17 Guys
00:38:18 Design aside
00:38:19 I actually found his battle
00:38:21 Sort of annoying
00:38:22 Like his personality
00:38:23 Or attitude
00:38:24 Or whatever you call it
00:38:25 I mean yeah
00:38:26 It's a little annoying
00:38:27 Yeah I mean he's a dick
00:38:28 Whatever
00:38:29 I like him
00:38:30 Like a fucking chud
00:38:31 I'm not even
00:38:32 I agree with you Ben
00:38:33 Like I think he's a good addition
00:38:34 To the game
00:38:35 I thought he was funny
00:38:36 And I enjoy you know
00:38:37 Treating him like the garbage
00:38:38 That he is
00:38:39 And I absolutely love
00:38:40 That you can murder him
00:38:41 And Sam says
00:38:42 You didn't kill anyone important
00:38:43 That's not true
00:38:44 And you can still get true pacimist
00:38:45 That's not true
00:38:46 What?
00:38:47 Yes it is
00:38:48 No you didn't
00:38:51 I don't believe you
00:38:52 I don't believe you
00:38:53 How do you know
00:38:54 Okay well I've just
00:38:55 I just
00:38:56 You've heard it?
00:38:57 I was reading on Reddit
00:38:58 Someone tested it and said it wasn't true
00:38:59 I'm gonna go look this up
00:39:00 That would be really stupid
00:39:01 If that was true
00:39:02 No it would be hilarious
00:39:03 And I would love it
00:39:04 It would really
00:39:05 There's more homework for you
00:39:07 For Undertale
00:39:08 Find Glide
00:39:09 And then test this thing
00:39:10 I will
00:39:11 I will
00:39:12 General Toby's done a good job
00:39:13 Handling fan stuff
00:39:14 By like sanctioning official albums
00:39:15 Like Live at Grillby's
00:39:16 And the other metal one
00:39:17 You know
00:39:18 Yeah that's cool
00:39:19 If you can like review and be like
00:39:21 That's what I would do
00:39:22 If I had created a thing
00:39:24 That had like a huge fandom around it
00:39:26 A lot of like
00:39:28 You know fan theories
00:39:29 And fan cannons
00:39:30 I would just go around
00:39:31 With my cannon stamp
00:39:33 And I would find the things I like
00:39:34 And go yeah
00:39:35 That's cannon
00:39:36 That's cannon
00:39:37 That sucks
00:39:38 That's cannon
00:39:39 If that happened to you Jesse
00:39:40 If you had
00:39:41 If you were in that position
00:39:42 Well no one's in a position
00:39:43 To do that to Jesse's shit
00:39:44 Okay okay listen
00:39:46 That is the game space funeral
00:39:48 By the catamites
00:39:50 That guy actually kind of did that
00:39:52 But it's hard to take seriously
00:39:55 Because someone made a space funeral too
00:39:57 And it wasn't that great
00:40:00 But I mean it was a thing
00:40:02 And just in an interview
00:40:04 Someone asked him like
00:40:05 Do you know about space funeral too
00:40:07 And he was like
00:40:08 Oh yeah sure
00:40:09 It was alright
00:40:10 It's cannon
00:40:11 Ah Jesus
00:40:12 What a hero
00:40:13 And so now it's technically cannon
00:40:14 Because he said so one time
00:40:16 Yeah it's like what
00:40:18 With the DBZ guy
00:40:20 A curatorium
00:40:21 It's like what he's doing with DBZ now
00:40:22 Like for a while he was just like
00:40:24 Yeah all these things are cannon
00:40:26 And like what he's doing now
00:40:27 With Dragon Ball Super whatever
00:40:28 He made like
00:40:29 He made like the strongest person
00:40:30 In the universe
00:40:31 Like this weird little dude
00:40:33 With like these giant nipples
00:40:34 He is like canonically
00:40:36 The strongest man
00:40:37 In I think every universe
00:40:39 That exists
00:40:40 And it's like
00:40:41 How seriously are we going to take
00:40:43 What a curatorium has said at this point
00:40:45 It's been like 30 years
00:40:46 Another cannon
00:40:47 See still
00:40:48 Yeah
00:40:49 Another cannon that's very big
00:40:50 Very pervasive
00:40:51 Pockabell's cannon
00:40:53 Indeed
00:40:54 That's in all these different songs
00:40:55 That's true
00:40:56 And that guy
00:40:57 I gotta say the fandom around that
00:40:59 Is really out of control
00:41:00 And it's time for a change
00:41:01 Yeah
00:41:02 Yeah
00:41:03 We've just been rehashing
00:41:04 And rehashing it
00:41:05 Since like 1640 whatever
00:41:07 Should we get back to the topic
00:41:09 Of receiving fan art?
00:41:10 Yes please
00:41:11 Sure whatever
00:41:12 Way off for a minute there
00:41:14 That's fine
00:41:15 Maze you've gotten fan art right?
00:41:17 11 pages on DeviantArt
00:41:20 Yes
00:41:21 Of your characters
00:41:22 Yeah
00:41:23 In my
00:41:24 Favorites folder
00:41:26 What do you think make
00:41:28 I was going to say
00:41:29 What makes good fan art
00:41:31 To you
00:41:32 To receive versus bad
00:41:34 I appreciate all fan art honestly
00:41:36 Like
00:41:37 Whatever the quality
00:41:39 You might think it is
00:41:40 It's okay
00:41:41 You can tell them their shit
00:41:42 No
00:41:43 People take time
00:41:45 Out of their day
00:41:46 To draw something
00:41:48 Specifically for me
00:41:49 So I'm going to take time
00:41:50 Out of my day
00:41:51 To favorite and leave a comment
00:41:53 Whenever I can
00:41:54 Maze you're a big person
00:41:55 They're little people
00:41:56 They don't matter
00:41:57 Oh that's not nice
00:41:59 Okay
00:42:00 Okay
00:42:01 Well I will say
00:42:02 One thing
00:42:03 Yeah I mean I agree
00:42:04 That I appreciate all fan art
00:42:05 Because it is a person
00:42:06 Taking time
00:42:07 To show appreciation
00:42:08 For what you do
00:42:09 And that's great
00:42:10 But
00:42:12 I don't care
00:42:13 For the ones
00:42:14 That are just trying
00:42:15 To look like the original
00:42:16 Dude
00:42:17 The t-bap fan art
00:42:18 That tried to copy your style
00:42:19 A lot of the t-bap fan art
00:42:20 Looked as though
00:42:21 It was traced
00:42:22 Like right off the screen
00:42:23 And it's like
00:42:24 Yeah okay
00:42:25 Thanks for the fan art
00:42:26 But you haven't really
00:42:27 Added anything
00:42:28 Or given like
00:42:29 Your own interpretation
00:42:30 Of it
00:42:31 Even if you can't draw
00:42:32 At all
00:42:33 I would still rather see
00:42:34 You just like
00:42:35 Try to draw
00:42:36 Fucking my characters
00:42:37 Or whatever
00:42:38 Just however you would draw
00:42:39 Like
00:42:40 Why did it take
00:42:41 Why did it take like
00:42:42 Three years
00:42:43 For someone to like
00:42:44 Draw
00:42:45 Like someone made a keg
00:42:46 Standard
00:42:47 Like normal
00:42:48 Like he looked like
00:42:49 He was in the show
00:42:50 And I still haven't seen
00:42:51 A phantom horn one
00:42:52 Anywhere
00:42:53 Like if it was me
00:42:54 I'd think that'd be
00:42:55 Like the first thing
00:42:56 That I'd want to do
00:42:57 Like he's a pony man
00:42:58 He's in the
00:42:59 Whatever
00:43:00 Just draw him that way
00:43:01 You know
00:43:02 It's like
00:43:03 Why is everybody
00:43:04 Drawn
00:43:05 They always draw us
00:43:06 In groups
00:43:07 Like with our
00:43:08 I agree
00:43:09 Yeah
00:43:10 I agree
00:43:11 If you're going to draw ponies
00:43:12 With big sparkly pony eyes
00:43:13 Just give them all
00:43:14 Fucking big sparkly pony eyes
00:43:15 If you want to draw them
00:43:16 With tiny little
00:43:17 Gross beady teabap eyes
00:43:18 Give everyone like that
00:43:19 You know who I blame for this problem
00:43:20 Just draw all eyes
00:43:21 The way you draw eyes
00:43:22 I blame Dr. Wolfe for this problem
00:43:23 Because he's got his
00:43:24 Bizarre weird OC
00:43:25 That doesn't even make sense
00:43:26 And everyone's like
00:43:27 Oh we have to
00:43:28 We have to just use
00:43:29 The style of the art
00:43:30 And put it in there
00:43:31 Dr. Wolfe can go to hell
00:43:32 And don't ever mention his name
00:43:34 I don't ever
00:43:35 Fucking say that name
00:43:37 Or any name
00:43:38 Don't ever say any name
00:43:39 In my presence again
00:43:40 Okay
00:43:41 Okay
00:43:42 Coming back to what Ben
00:43:43 Originally said
00:43:44 Yes
00:43:45 About you know
00:43:46 Tracing art and trying to
00:43:47 Make it look like original
00:43:48 Yeah I agree with you
00:43:49 I have seen people just
00:43:50 Sort of like
00:43:51 Or take my original images
00:43:52 And just sort of like
00:43:53 Doodle on them
00:43:54 Or add some text or whatever
00:43:56 Make them into like
00:43:57 A collage or something
00:43:59 Yeah
00:44:00 It's not
00:44:01 I mean
00:44:02 Okay you wanted to do
00:44:03 Something and you're
00:44:04 Very good at art
00:44:05 And okay I appreciate the effort
00:44:06 But at the same time
00:44:07 I prefer whatever you can do
00:44:09 To love to you
00:44:10 Right
00:44:11 Copy pasting my work
00:44:12 Yeah
00:44:13 It's kind of like
00:44:14 The illustration equivalent
00:44:15 Of like
00:44:16 Like a knock off YouTuber
00:44:17 Like the angry video game
00:44:18 Nerd knock offs
00:44:19 Being like the waging
00:44:21 I don't know
00:44:22 Whatever
00:44:23 Because I've seen guys
00:44:24 On YouTube
00:44:25 A couple guys actually
00:44:26 Who you know
00:44:27 Are like
00:44:28 Openly proudly inspired
00:44:29 By me
00:44:30 And I watch their videos
00:44:31 But it's like
00:44:32 At the point where
00:44:33 They're just like
00:44:34 Stealing my jokes verbatim
00:44:35 Yeah
00:44:36 And it's like
00:44:37 I saw that one guy
00:44:38 You showed me
00:44:39 That was just
00:44:40 Your video
00:44:41 It's cool that you're
00:44:42 Inspired by me
00:44:43 But this is literally
00:44:44 A worse version of my video
00:44:46 Yeah
00:44:47 I'll kill you
00:44:48 The inspiration and
00:44:49 Stealing work
00:44:50 Is two different things
00:44:51 Hey
00:44:52 I mean
00:44:53 If it's for fan art
00:44:54 Then I would never call
00:44:55 It stealing
00:44:56 No matter how boldly
00:44:57 They've
00:44:58 You know
00:44:59 You know
00:45:00 You mentioned
00:45:01 James Rawl
00:45:02 You mentioned the angry nerd
00:45:03 And
00:45:04 He blinded me back
00:45:05 When I was first
00:45:06 Getting into the nerd
00:45:07 Way back then
00:45:08 And I looked at the fan art
00:45:09 What bothered me
00:45:10 Is that almost
00:45:11 None of the fan art
00:45:12 Looks like his face
00:45:14 Almost none of the
00:45:15 The eyes
00:45:16 Or the noses
00:45:17 Or the mouths
00:45:18 Really looks like
00:45:19 An abstraction
00:45:20 Of what James Rawl
00:45:21 Had
00:45:22 There was a guy
00:45:23 Who did
00:45:24 You know
00:45:25 As we mentioned
00:45:26 Fan art of all of us
00:45:27 And you know
00:45:28 It was cool looking
00:45:29 But almost none of it
00:45:30 Really like
00:45:31 Captured our facial features
00:45:32 All that much
00:45:33 I don't understand
00:45:34 Picture perfect
00:45:35 Or even
00:45:36 Almost unrealistic
00:45:37 I think when it's
00:45:38 A real life person
00:45:39 And you're going for
00:45:40 A somewhat
00:45:41 Depending on how
00:45:42 Realistic you are
00:45:43 Just look at your icon
00:45:44 Right now
00:45:45 I'm looking at it
00:45:46 Right now
00:45:47 It doesn't look
00:45:48 Anything like you
00:45:49 And I appreciate it
00:45:50 I agree
00:45:51 I'm not saying
00:45:52 This is like
00:45:53 A required thing
00:45:54 I just wish
00:45:55 It would happen
00:45:56 Sometimes
00:45:57 Or
00:45:58 Let me put it this way
00:45:59 If you're going to make
00:46:00 Like
00:46:01 A more abstract
00:46:02 All of those little
00:46:03 Squiggly details he has
00:46:04 Will be some sort of representation
00:46:06 Of our facial features
00:46:08 You know
00:46:09 I guess
00:46:10 Look at Maze
00:46:11 Maze doesn't look like her thing
00:46:12 She's got like an established
00:46:13 Character now
00:46:14 That like is her face
00:46:15 And it's you know
00:46:16 Yes it's me
00:46:17 That's draw me
00:46:18 As a purple anime girl
00:46:19 Nothing else
00:46:20 Yeah
00:46:21 And you know
00:46:22 This reminds me real quick
00:46:23 Speaking of fan art
00:46:24 And the angry video game nerd
00:46:25 Did you guys ever see
00:46:26 That
00:46:27 I forget what anime it was
00:46:28 But like in a real anime
00:46:29 Some background extras
00:46:31 Were with the video game nerd
00:46:32 And the nostalgia critic were
00:46:33 In an anime
00:46:34 Like in some big show
00:46:35 Yeah
00:46:36 They were actually
00:46:37 Acting in the background
00:46:38 Drawn in some show
00:46:39 And in James Rolton
00:46:40 John Walker
00:46:41 Made a fan
00:46:42 Recreation of that
00:46:43 They did a fan recreation
00:46:44 Of that by
00:46:45 Re-staging it
00:46:46 Which is just like what we did
00:46:48 When or most
00:46:49 Some of us here
00:46:50 When someone did that fan art
00:46:51 Of give and take
00:46:52 Never give up
00:46:53 And we recreated that
00:46:54 At BronyCon last year
00:46:56 Which was
00:46:57 Never give up
00:46:58 Never give up
00:46:59 That's right
00:47:00 Good times
00:47:01 The best
00:47:02 Um
00:47:03 I
00:47:04 Okay
00:47:05 Those
00:47:06 No those fan arts
00:47:07 Someone did of the procrastinators
00:47:08 Yeah
00:47:09 Mine looked like absolute ass
00:47:10 And I hated it
00:47:11 Sure
00:47:12 My face was the most
00:47:13 Like it was totally
00:47:14 Like warped and disgusting
00:47:15 Get it together
00:47:16 Whoever you are
00:47:17 Yeah
00:47:18 Let's talk about
00:47:19 Crappy fan art
00:47:20 Of us
00:47:21 And how much it
00:47:22 Anchors you
00:47:23 No I was wearing glasses
00:47:24 And I had a little heart
00:47:25 Tattoo on my neck
00:47:26 Yeah
00:47:27 Which was cool
00:47:28 That was cool
00:47:29 But you can find it
00:47:30 On the procrastinators
00:47:31 Yeah
00:47:32 The reddit
00:47:33 The subreddit
00:47:34 We'll show you
00:47:35 We'll show you
00:47:36 You can go there
00:47:37 God damn it
00:47:38 Click in the link in the description
00:47:39 Shut up guy
00:47:40 Fuck's sake
00:47:41 Alright
00:47:42 Yeah Jesse
00:47:43 Let's talk about
00:47:44 Shit fan art
00:47:45 I love getting fan art
00:47:46 Of all kinds
00:47:47 I think it's the best thing
00:47:48 It's the thing from the fans
00:47:49 That I respect the most
00:47:50 I respect it infinitely
00:47:51 More than some
00:47:52 Shitty, worthless
00:47:53 Pissant
00:47:54 YouTube comment
00:47:55 That took you half a second
00:47:56 To fucking crap out of
00:47:57 Your shitty brain
00:47:58 Yeah
00:47:59 If someone actually takes a time
00:48:00 To draw something
00:48:01 Or make something
00:48:02 That makes me feel good
00:48:03 And a lot of it's really good
00:48:04 But what I don't like
00:48:05 Is the ones
00:48:07 The guys who like
00:48:08 Make it crappy on purpose
00:48:09 Just be like
00:48:10 Hey you crappy fan art
00:48:11 That's not fun for anyone
00:48:12 Jesse
00:48:13 Get out of here
00:48:14 You're one to fucking talk
00:48:15 Look at your fucking
00:48:16 YouTube thumbnails
00:48:18 What are you talking about
00:48:19 Look at your fucking
00:48:20 Horse cast
00:48:21 YouTube thumbnails
00:48:22 That's the very definition
00:48:23 Of crappy on purpose
00:48:24 Whoa whoa whoa
00:48:25 Whoa
00:48:26 My
00:48:27 MS Paint
00:48:28 Masterpieces
00:48:29 Thumbnail drawings
00:48:30 Are goddamn masterpieces
00:48:32 They're 10 out of 10s
00:48:34 How dare you
00:48:35 Insinuate that they're anything
00:48:37 Less than perfect
00:48:38 That they're flawed in any way
00:48:40 They capture our spirit
00:48:41 They capture our essence
00:48:43 Yeah
00:48:44 I don't know man
00:48:45 I think they're just trying to go for
00:48:47 I think they're
00:48:48 Maybe they're just trying to go
00:48:49 For that same sort of appeal
00:48:50 You know
00:48:51 I can guarantee you
00:48:52 I can guarantee you
00:48:53 That I am legitimately
00:48:54 Putting my all
00:48:55 And giving the maximum amount
00:48:56 Of effort when I draw those
00:48:57 Well if it's all the same
00:48:58 To the person seeing it
00:48:59 On the other end
00:49:00 Whether you put your all
00:49:01 Or not right
00:49:02 Yeah
00:49:03 It's great
00:49:04 10 out of 10
00:49:05 And you guy
00:49:06 Let's not even talk about
00:49:07 Your art
00:49:08 I'm proud to be the worst
00:49:09 Artist that I know
00:49:10 I wear it on my sleeve
00:49:12 As armor
00:49:13 So that it can never be used
00:49:14 To hurt me
00:49:15 Yeah that's right
00:49:16 You piece of shit
00:49:17 It depends on the context
00:49:18 As you go
00:49:19 And I have no interest
00:49:20 In getting any better ever
00:49:21 Now that I've discovered
00:49:22 That I can pay people
00:49:23 To draw things for me
00:49:24 I have no incentive
00:49:25 To get better
00:49:26 It's the best possible timeline
00:49:27 Oh yeah
00:49:28 Well there's a commission
00:49:29 In my armor
00:49:30 Because Ben has hurt me
00:49:31 Let's talk about commissions
00:49:32 Yes
00:49:33 Yes
00:49:34 Podcast successful
00:49:35 If I get into being
00:49:37 A person with a lot of money
00:49:39 I would just be commissioning people
00:49:41 To make fan stuff
00:49:42 That I want to see
00:49:43 All the time
00:49:44 No dude
00:49:45 No dude
00:49:46 Listen
00:49:47 I could never pay someone
00:49:48 To do art for me
00:49:49 Because it wouldn't look
00:49:50 The way it did in my head
00:49:51 Sure
00:49:52 I have to do it
00:49:53 My way
00:49:54 I know what you mean
00:49:55 Yeah well I can't
00:49:56 I can't do drawing
00:49:57 So I can compromise on this
00:49:58 Wait mate you do agree with me
00:49:59 Or you don't
00:50:00 I agree with you
00:50:01 Like I cannot
00:50:02 Like pay people to do
00:50:04 Like commissions for
00:50:05 Like I cannot
00:50:07 Commission people
00:50:08 To do art for me
00:50:09 Because like for me
00:50:10 I have this horrible thing
00:50:12 About like
00:50:13 If it can be drawn
00:50:14 I might as well draw it myself
00:50:16 Well of course you guys
00:50:17 Can draw
00:50:18 You guys have that ability
00:50:19 No shut up Davoo
00:50:20 I'm gonna kill you for saying that
00:50:21 And here's why
00:50:22 Because all of my drawings
00:50:23 Look like shit when I start them
00:50:24 And I just fucking
00:50:25 Keep changing them
00:50:26 Until they look good
00:50:27 So all anyone
00:50:28 In the whole world
00:50:29 Has to do
00:50:30 Is just draw a shitty drawing
00:50:31 And then just keep redoing them
00:50:32 Until
00:50:33 Okay that's all I do
00:50:34 I'm sick and tired
00:50:35 Anyone can do it themselves
00:50:36 I'm sick and tired
00:50:37 Of this professional illustrator
00:50:38 Elitism
00:50:39 Fucking looking down
00:50:40 On people this pompous attitude of
00:50:42 Oh shut up
00:50:43 You can learn to draw
00:50:44 Anyone can learn to
00:50:45 Fuck you
00:50:46 I've tried motherfucker
00:50:47 I can't
00:50:48 It's impossible
00:50:49 Ben is absolutely right
00:50:50 Quit kind of sending to me
00:50:51 Anyone can learn to draw
00:50:52 Anyone can do it
00:50:53 The thing is
00:50:54 I don't want to
00:50:55 I don't want to take five years
00:50:56 To learn how to draw
00:50:57 Because I need a picture
00:50:58 For my video next week
00:50:59 Here's the thing
00:51:00 Yeah Ben I totally agree
00:51:01 I totally agree
00:51:02 I don't have time for that shit
00:51:03 I could just pay someone
00:51:04 You just redo it
00:51:05 Over and over again
00:51:06 And eventually it becomes good
00:51:07 I do not have the technical know how
00:51:09 Listen
00:51:10 I can't do that
00:51:11 But it will take me
00:51:12 Ten times as long
00:51:13 As it will take you
00:51:14 And you'll be glad
00:51:15 And you'll be glad
00:51:16 For the experience
00:51:17 No I'd be glad to
00:51:18 Pay money to save myself the time
00:51:19 So I can be working on my video
00:51:20 And editing it
00:51:21 Guys
00:51:22 Do the things
00:51:23 That you are better at
00:51:24 And pay for
00:51:25 Davoose
00:51:26 Alright Davoose
00:51:27 Enough
00:51:28 Okay
00:51:29 Paying for commissions is fine
00:51:30 Like guys
00:51:31 I am going to open commissions soon
00:51:33 So yes please do pay me for commissions
00:51:35 Everybody pay me
00:51:36 Oh shit
00:51:37 She's got skin in the game
00:51:38 She's got skin in the game
00:51:39 It's an important thing
00:51:40 I'm going to do that too
00:51:41 So forget everything I just said
00:51:43 But the thing is
00:51:44 Like you can learn how to draw
00:51:47 Like there's a certain amount of hours
00:51:49 You have to
00:51:50 Have been drawing
00:51:51 In your life
00:51:54 I think there's
00:51:55 There's some sort of rule
00:51:56 Somewhere this is
00:51:57 Like oh
00:51:58 If you had drawn
00:51:59 This many thousand hours in your life
00:52:01 And you should be okay at art
00:52:03 Guess what
00:52:04 We only have so many hours
00:52:05 Into something new
00:52:06 We only have so many hours
00:52:07 In our life
00:52:08 Before we potentially die
00:52:09 We have to choose
00:52:10 What's true
00:52:11 To go for
00:52:12 I don't understand
00:52:13 So like
00:52:14 You know
00:52:15 It's never too late
00:52:16 To learn to draw
00:52:17 But you have to
00:52:18 It's too late to care
00:52:19 If you're a high school kid
00:52:20 And you just
00:52:21 You're not doing anything
00:52:22 Particularly important with your life
00:52:23 And you want to learn to draw
00:52:24 Then you should absolutely do it
00:52:25 But
00:52:26 You know
00:52:27 Our video creators first and foremost
00:52:28 And that's what we focus our time on
00:52:30 And that's what we have interest in
00:52:31 Perfectly
00:52:32 Like I was a terrible video editor
00:52:33 What three years ago when I started
00:52:35 But I've just done it
00:52:36 For millions of hours now
00:52:37 And I'm decent
00:52:38 I'm okay
00:52:39 So I assume it's the same with art
00:52:41 The whole point of society
00:52:42 Is that you pay
00:52:43 And how all you genius illustrators
00:52:44 Are with your art
00:52:45 How you said
00:52:46 That you
00:52:47 Are saying it was such a scorn
00:52:48 You genius illustrators
00:52:50 How you said that
00:52:51 Like you can't commission
00:52:52 Someone to draw something
00:52:53 That's how I am with editing
00:52:54 I can't commission someone to edit
00:52:55 For me
00:52:56 That's exactly right
00:52:57 My videos could never be made
00:52:58 I'll commission a guy to draw for me any day
00:53:00 Because
00:53:01 Fucking make it look pretty
00:53:02 Make me look pretty
00:53:03 The whole point of paying people money
00:53:04 For anything ever
00:53:05 Is that they can do it better than you can
00:53:07 You could grow and cultivate
00:53:08 All your own food
00:53:09 But it's a lot easier
00:53:10 To just pay for it
00:53:11 To be off a shelf
00:53:12 Right
00:53:13 Specialization is the nature of capitalism
00:53:14 Right
00:53:15 I can respect that
00:53:16 But whatever
00:53:18 Like if you were making like
00:53:20 If you were the angry video game nerd
00:53:22 And you had like a million subscribers
00:53:23 And you're like
00:53:24 Okay, time to make a new video
00:53:25 I'm gonna do every single piece of it
00:53:26 It's not feasible
00:53:28 It's not smart
00:53:29 You gotta break that shit up
00:53:33 I feel like I had something else to say
00:53:35 On the subject of
00:53:36 I don't know
00:53:37 Drawing
00:53:38 Or
00:53:39 Commissioning
00:53:40 Or
00:53:41 Fan art
00:53:42 Or whatever it is we're talking about here
00:53:44 On the Procast Nudist podcast
00:53:46 Every weekend or so
00:53:50 Yeah, I don't know
00:53:52 But really honestly
00:53:54 The worst sin
00:53:55 A fan artist
00:53:56 At all
00:53:57 Can commit
00:53:58 Is not
00:53:59 Drawing
00:54:00 Best guy ever
00:54:01 Fan art
00:54:02 Get out there people
00:54:03 Get out there on your tablets
00:54:04 And your gay little notebooks
00:54:05 Do whatever you gotta do
00:54:06 To draw fan art of me
00:54:08 And my cool waifus
00:54:10 I'll have it a great time
00:54:11 Because if you don't make it real
00:54:12 It will never be real
00:54:13 So live your dreams
00:54:14 And live my dreams
00:54:15 Okay, while I can respect the attitude
00:54:17 Of like
00:54:18 Oh, it's easier to just pay someone to draw it
00:54:20 I can understand that
00:54:22 And that attitude is what keeps me
00:54:24 Alive
00:54:25 And in business
00:54:26 Kind of
00:54:27 So that's fine
00:54:28 But
00:54:29 On the other hand
00:54:30 I kind of hate that attitude
00:54:32 Because
00:54:33 I really like it
00:54:34 When people that don't know how to draw
00:54:36 And are bad at drawing
00:54:37 Nevertheless
00:54:38 Like put forth a sincere effort
00:54:40 And produce an image
00:54:42 That just to get across
00:54:44 Their idea
00:54:45 Like
00:54:46 I think
00:54:47 Like I was reading this comic
00:54:48 The other day
00:54:49 Called Skuzzy
00:54:50 And it was about like
00:54:51 Some kids that wake up as zombies
00:54:52 And it sounds stupid, right?
00:54:54 But it's
00:54:55 Drawn
00:54:56 In this really like
00:54:57 Child-like way
00:54:58 Everything's all like
00:54:59 Real simple
00:55:00 Like blocky shapes
00:55:01 And like
00:55:02 Everything's all colored
00:55:03 And like
00:55:04 Flat colors
00:55:05 Like the characters are just purple
00:55:06 And their teachers are yellow
00:55:07 Yeah?
00:55:09 Have you all seen
00:55:10 The original One Punch Man
00:55:12 Webcom?
00:55:13 Yes
00:55:14 Ah, that's a good example
00:55:15 I guess of what you're saying
00:55:16 Yes, I have
00:55:17 Yeah, it's got really
00:55:18 Really basic shitty art
00:55:19 Yeah, so
00:55:20 It's really rough
00:55:21 Look at the brick into that
00:55:22 And even
00:55:23 Attack on Titan
00:55:24 At the beginning
00:55:25 Kind of is shitty
00:55:26 It's still a shitty
00:55:27 It's too shitty
00:55:28 To be published
00:55:29 As it was
00:55:30 I don't know how it got through
00:55:31 Their approval process
00:55:32 But it did somehow
00:55:33 And it was popular
00:55:34 Okay, okay
00:55:35 Forget about
00:55:36 The actual
00:55:37 Attack on Titan manga
00:55:38 Yeah
00:55:39 If you ever saw
00:55:40 Like
00:55:41 The manga
00:55:42 That he did before
00:55:43 Attack on Titan
00:55:44 That he submitted to some
00:55:45 Like shitty little
00:55:46 Rinky Dink contest
00:55:47 It is so bad
00:55:48 Every bit
00:55:49 Of that like
00:55:50 Proto
00:55:51 Attack on Titan manga
00:55:52 Yeah
00:55:53 Is worse
00:55:54 Than the worst panel
00:55:55 Of the original
00:55:56 One Punch manga
00:55:57 And there's some pretty bad ones
00:55:58 It is like
00:55:59 Fucking a child's scribbling
00:56:01 How the fuck did he win?
00:56:03 I don't know if he won
00:56:05 I'd like that he just lost
00:56:06 Or maybe it was just
00:56:07 A really bad contest
00:56:08 I don't know
00:56:09 Well, that's fascinating
00:56:10 Maybe they lack the idea
00:56:11 Of the story
00:56:12 And not just the art
00:56:13 Okay, but you're making
00:56:14 A comic for Christ's sake
00:56:15 You're not making
00:56:16 A book
00:56:17 Although the story
00:56:18 Was way more basic
00:56:19 Than Attack on Titan
00:56:20 It's just like
00:56:21 A guy comes to town
00:56:22 And there's like
00:56:23 A monster
00:56:24 It was a genetically
00:56:25 Engineered monster
00:56:26 Luckily I too
00:56:27 Am a genetically
00:56:28 Engineered monster
00:56:29 And he gets big
00:56:30 And fights it
00:56:31 And that's it
00:56:32 That's the whole story
00:56:33 Yeah
00:56:34 That's the end
00:56:35 Of really shitty comics
00:56:36 Becoming popular
00:56:37 One Punch Man is
00:56:38 Legitimately great
00:56:39 And deserves it
00:56:40 They're not shitty
00:56:41 Just because they have
00:56:42 Rough art
00:56:43 They're really like
00:56:44 Scuzzy
00:56:45 I really like
00:56:46 The original
00:56:47 One Punch Man
00:56:48 I really like
00:56:49 Just fucking
00:56:50 Garbage made by
00:56:51 Assholes
00:56:52 But when you compare that
00:56:53 To like
00:56:54 The new version of
00:56:55 One Punch Man
00:56:56 It's pretty much
00:56:57 Better in every way
00:56:58 I don't care
00:56:59 I like
00:57:00 The original
00:57:01 Remakes should all
00:57:02 Burn
00:57:03 I mean
00:57:04 I agree
00:57:05 I've been watching the show
00:57:06 And I keep thinking
00:57:07 The whole
00:57:08 Part of the integral
00:57:09 To the joke
00:57:10 To the reason it's funny
00:57:11 And amusing
00:57:12 Is that it looks amazing
00:57:15 But it's
00:57:16 Silly what's happening
00:57:17 But it looks amazing
00:57:18 Similarly to
00:57:19 That is true
00:57:20 That is a unique joke
00:57:21 How weird Al
00:57:22 His entire comedy
00:57:23 Requires
00:57:24 His incredible production
00:57:25 Value
00:57:26 That's true
00:57:27 Because
00:57:28 It becomes
00:57:29 As valid
00:57:30 As the original
00:57:31 Song that was made
00:57:32 If not even
00:57:33 Better produced
00:57:34 As it is sometimes
00:57:35 That is integral
00:57:36 To why it's funny
00:57:37 You know
00:57:38 My favorite image
00:57:39 That proves that point
00:57:40 I think
00:57:41 Is when you see
00:57:42 King
00:57:43 Like there's a couple
00:57:44 Panels
00:57:45 That are these
00:57:46 Massive close-ups
00:57:47 Of King's face
00:57:48 And King's whole deal
00:57:49 Is that he has just
00:57:50 Intimidated people
00:57:51 With his scary face
00:57:52 And everyone thinks
00:57:53 That he's super strong
00:57:54 And you know
00:57:55 As it turns out
00:57:56 That's not the case
00:57:57 And like
00:57:58 The super good
00:57:59 Detailed like
00:58:00 Intimidating glare
00:58:01 Is what like
00:58:02 The people in the story
00:58:03 Are experiencing
00:58:04 And with shitty art
00:58:05 That would not be conveyed
00:58:06 Anywhere nearly as well
00:58:07 And makes the joke so much funnier
00:58:08 When you find out
00:58:09 Oh
00:58:10 It's fucking
00:58:11 It's fucking not true
00:58:12 It's fucking baloney
00:58:13 Yeah
00:58:14 So that's a unique thing
00:58:15 To the
00:58:16 Enhanced version
00:58:17 I want
00:58:18 I just really want
00:58:19 To reiterate
00:58:20 That I think that
00:58:21 People
00:58:22 That can't draw at all
00:58:24 Honestly
00:58:25 Sometimes I think
00:58:26 That makes their art
00:58:27 More interesting
00:58:28 Like if you put forth
00:58:29 Like a sincere effort
00:58:30 Like the guy who
00:58:31 Poo-pooed on my
00:58:32 M.S. paint drawings
00:58:34 No
00:58:35 I was just about to say
00:58:36 Now I see
00:58:37 Your true
00:58:38 Hypocritical colors
00:58:39 Where's my
00:58:40 Hypocritical colors?
00:58:41 I was just about to say
00:58:42 That if someone like
00:58:43 I mean
00:58:44 I would say like
00:58:45 Davoo
00:58:46 You have like
00:58:47 You're not a great artist
00:58:48 Or anything
00:58:49 But you do have like
00:58:50 A very like
00:58:51 Kind of
00:58:52 Unique aesthetic
00:58:53 And everything
00:58:54 That you do draw
00:58:55 And the same is kind
00:58:56 Of true of Digi
00:58:57 Digi has this weird
00:58:58 Like scratchy
00:58:59 I would really like
00:59:00 To see more art
00:59:01 By people like that
00:59:02 Yeah
00:59:03 Like my art
00:59:04 I do make sure
00:59:05 Whatever I
00:59:06 Because I always draw
00:59:07 Something for the purpose
00:59:08 Of something else
00:59:09 That needs to like
00:59:10 Convey something visually
00:59:11 Or I'm making it
00:59:12 For a thumbnail
00:59:13 So I always have a clear idea
00:59:14 And I'm usually
00:59:15 Able to square it in on
00:59:16 At least accomplishing
00:59:17 The goal that
00:59:18 It was intended for
00:59:19 Even if it otherwise
00:59:20 Sucks
00:59:21 But what about
00:59:22 Like you drew that little face
00:59:23 That little face
00:59:24 With just like this
00:59:25 Gross little thumbs up
00:59:26 Just kind of sticking
00:59:27 Out of the side
00:59:28 Like
00:59:29 I almost made that
00:59:30 My thumbnail
00:59:31 And I love how
00:59:32 Polarizing it was
00:59:33 Like people either thought
00:59:34 That was amazing
00:59:35 Or horrifying
00:59:36 And they never wanted to see it
00:59:37 I know you were torn up
00:59:38 About whether
00:59:39 To use it or not
00:59:40 Yeah
00:59:41 Until eventually someone
00:59:42 Came around with one
00:59:43 That I thought was basically
00:59:44 Perfect which is what
00:59:45 I'm using now
00:59:46 So Ben are you saying
00:59:47 That guys like me and Jesse
00:59:48 On further down
00:59:50 On the artistically competent
00:59:52 Spectrum if you will
00:59:53 On the artistism spectrum
00:59:56 Yeah that's right
00:59:57 Our shitty art has value
01:00:00 Because it's shitty
01:00:01 It's an artistic representation
01:00:04 Of ourselves
01:00:05 Someone just drawing
01:00:07 Like what's in their mind
01:00:09 Even if they have
01:00:10 Without any technique at all
01:00:12 Can sometimes convey something
01:00:14 That you wouldn't get
01:00:15 From like a very practiced
01:00:17 And like skilled artists
01:00:19 Like on this very podcast
01:00:20 On the Steven Universe episode
01:00:22 Episode three I think
01:00:23 My Mexican cherry opal
01:00:26 I think was his name
01:00:27 Yeah Mexican cherry opal
01:00:29 That's true
01:00:30 He was a masterpiece
01:00:31 That's no doubt
01:00:33 And you know
01:00:34 Talking about Digi
01:00:35 Because way back in his
01:00:37 Some of his earliest pony videos
01:00:39 He drew this character
01:00:42 This really weird looking
01:00:43 Terribly drawn character
01:00:44 The gray thing with the white hair
01:00:46 Yeah and then recently
01:00:48 In one of his asterisk videos
01:00:49 He makes a reference
01:00:50 I saw you put it in there
01:00:51 He makes a reference
01:00:52 When he said who am I
01:00:54 To complain about characters
01:00:55 Design
01:00:56 Yeah what would I know
01:00:57 About character design
01:00:58 And I decided to draw
01:00:59 A fan art of that character
01:01:00 That would be making
01:01:01 A specific pose
01:01:02 That would fit
01:01:03 And so in the process
01:01:04 Of drawing that
01:01:05 I realized
01:01:06 Whoa this is actually
01:01:07 An interesting design
01:01:08 It's just terribly drawn
01:01:10 But it's a kind of
01:01:11 Interesting character
01:01:12 That I've never seen before
01:01:13 Especially the color palette
01:01:15 So yeah
01:01:16 Yeah that's true
01:01:17 When he does draw things
01:01:19 They end up looking really weird
01:01:20 But in a way that I kind of like
01:01:21 Yeah like when we did
01:01:22 The comic jam
01:01:23 I remember thinking
01:01:24 The art was very interesting
01:01:26 It was one of the most interesting
01:01:28 Along with like
01:01:29 Yeah like there's
01:01:30 One of like
01:01:31 Just like a close up
01:01:32 Picture of a pony
01:01:33 Like screaming
01:01:34 Yeah that's right
01:01:35 And it's really
01:01:36 Spooky looking
01:01:37 I think Digi in general
01:01:38 Is a guy who is
01:01:39 Who is able to
01:01:40 Really really really
01:01:42 Think about
01:01:43 What he likes aesthetically
01:01:45 Like he has very specific
01:01:47 And detailed ideas
01:01:49 Of what looks good
01:01:50 Yeah
01:01:51 But not a whole lot
01:01:53 Of skill in explaining it
01:01:54 All the time
01:01:55 And obviously almost
01:01:56 No skill in recreating it
01:01:58 See that's my problem
01:01:59 I'm not
01:02:00 I'm a shitty artist
01:02:01 Because I can't visualize
01:02:03 What I want something to be
01:02:04 And then convey it
01:02:05 In my pen
01:02:06 And a lot of the times
01:02:07 I'll have ideas
01:02:08 Of what I want to do
01:02:09 And it just
01:02:10 It won't come out
01:02:11 It will not come out
01:02:12 Anywhere close to
01:02:13 How I'm envisioning it
01:02:14 What
01:02:15 What can you do about that
01:02:16 What can be done
01:02:17 Because when I was drawing
01:02:18 That fan art of that character
01:02:19 Of his
01:02:20 I was really looking at it
01:02:21 More closely
01:02:22 And I was imitating
01:02:23 Some of the
01:02:24 Crappy drawing
01:02:25 Like
01:02:26 Like inking methods
01:02:27 That he was using
01:02:28 Where he would
01:02:29 Draw some of the hair
01:02:30 And then use the erase tool
01:02:31 To make different threads
01:02:33 Of the hair
01:02:34 I was like whoa
01:02:35 So
01:02:36 His lack of skill
01:02:37 Created like a unique
01:02:38 Look
01:02:39 That's kind of how I did the hair
01:02:42 On my latest picture
01:02:44 On my Twitter
01:02:45 It's also ugly
01:02:46 Everyone go follow me
01:02:47 Well I mean
01:02:48 He would use a pretty
01:02:50 Thick erase tool
01:02:52 But
01:02:53 Yeah
01:02:54 Um
01:02:55 So yeah
01:02:56 The lack of skill
01:02:57 Can create a unique aesthetic
01:02:59 So what you're advocating here
01:03:00 Ben
01:03:01 Is to not assume
01:03:03 That even if you are
01:03:04 The shittiest artist in the world
01:03:05 Don't assume
01:03:06 That you don't have
01:03:07 Any ability to produce
01:03:08 Your own work
01:03:09 You gotta
01:03:10 You gotta take it
01:03:11 Sometimes you just gotta
01:03:12 Do it
01:03:13 And see how it comes out
01:03:14 Because even your shittiness
01:03:15 Can give it its own personality
01:03:16 Well clearly
01:03:17 With one punch man
01:03:18 That was great
01:03:19 I was able to make it
01:03:20 To prove that it was
01:03:21 Worth existing
01:03:22 And then was able to
01:03:23 Get it drawn well
01:03:25 I'll give you that
01:03:26 I'll give you that
01:03:27 However I gotta say
01:03:28 That guys in the position
01:03:29 For example of me and Davoo
01:03:31 Who are focused on other things
01:03:32 And are just trying to
01:03:33 Manage their time to get shitt done
01:03:35 For example right now
01:03:36 Right now in this very moment
01:03:37 I'm commissioning a guy
01:03:38 To make this pixel art thing for me
01:03:40 And I don't know
01:03:41 Fucking shit about making pixel art
01:03:42 What am I gonna do
01:03:43 Gonna learn how to do pixel art
01:03:44 He's talking about all these
01:03:45 Mathematical equations
01:03:46 That he's applying to like
01:03:47 Animate pixels moving and stuff
01:03:49 To replicate like
01:03:50 Different effects in the sky and stuff
01:03:51 Like am I gonna learn
01:03:52 All that shit
01:03:53 No of course not
01:03:54 That's why I'm commissioning a guy
01:03:55 And it's the same thing with
01:03:56 Whatever
01:03:57 Yeah it just works smart
01:03:58 Like I made an RPG once
01:04:00 And I'm not a very good pixel artist
01:04:02 But I did most of it myself
01:04:04 Because I had to
01:04:05 You know
01:04:06 And that I had to
01:04:08 So that I could make a game
01:04:09 And even Toby Fox
01:04:11 Is not a very good artist
01:04:13 You know
01:04:14 That's true
01:04:15 Look at the beginning
01:04:16 The frisk who looks like shit
01:04:17 And then the whole beginning area
01:04:18 The ruins looks like garbage
01:04:19 Compared to the rest of the game
01:04:20 Which looks much better
01:04:21 Right
01:04:22 The guy who made Lisa
01:04:23 Is not a great artist
01:04:24 Yeah
01:04:25 But he
01:04:26 In his figures look really weird
01:04:27 But in that kind of like
01:04:28 Strangely comedic game
01:04:30 It works really well
01:04:31 They give personality
01:04:32 And he's not a great artist
01:04:33 It's true
01:04:34 You know
01:04:35 You made a fair point there Ben
01:04:36 It works smart
01:04:37 Because
01:04:38 Like Trey Park and Matt Stone
01:04:39 They made the South Park characters
01:04:40 Even though they can't do good art
01:04:42 And those designs
01:04:43 They're iconic now
01:04:44 Yeah they're iconic
01:04:45 They're fucking fully cool
01:04:46 That makes them cool
01:04:47 And
01:04:49 And
01:04:50 Yahtzee
01:04:51 Making his air punctuation art style
01:04:53 You know he hasn't ever had
01:04:54 To update that
01:04:55 And he can't really do art
01:04:56 Otherwise
01:04:57 And again it's working smart
01:04:58 It's knowing your limitations
01:05:00 Down to the wire
01:05:01 Yes working around
01:05:02 Your own limitations
01:05:03 Yes
01:05:04 That's where art comes from
01:05:05 And it's related to fan art
01:05:07 To bring it home
01:05:09 That's true
01:05:10 Anyone can do fan art
01:05:11 Doesn't matter about your level of skill
01:05:13 But get creative
01:05:14 Do what you
01:05:15 You know have an idea
01:05:16 Have a vision
01:05:17 Get creative and put forth a sincere effort
01:05:19 And your vision
01:05:20 Will shine through your lack of skill
01:05:22 I absolutely love
01:05:23 Our shitty first ever T-Bap fan art
01:05:26 It felt like there was heart
01:05:28 It was all fucked up
01:05:29 And I loved it
01:05:30 Yes it was drawn in their own style
01:05:32 It wasn't just like
01:05:33 Traced from our thumbnail
01:05:35 It was its own thing
01:05:37 And I'd like everyone to do likewise
01:05:40 Yes
01:05:41 Alright anybody got any last words to say
01:05:43 I'm gonna throw in another
01:05:46 You know one of those
01:05:50 Jesse
01:05:51 I should have killed myself years ago
01:05:53 Yeah
01:05:54 Because of your lack of art skills
01:05:56 Yes
01:05:57 Yeah
01:05:58 That would have been better
01:06:00 I think we got a lot done today everyone
01:06:03 I think we've really made progress
01:06:05 I think we've all come to understand things a little bit better
01:06:07 Our
01:06:08 Well good
01:06:10 Okay
01:06:11 Everybody draw fan art
01:06:12 Mostly me
01:06:13 And also these guys too
01:06:14 Everybody should do it more
01:06:16 Go to the subreddit
01:06:17 There's a link in the description
01:06:18 Go to the subreddit
01:06:19 Give us PCP fan art
01:06:21 At the very least of the five of us
01:06:22 Who are here today
01:06:23 I demand it of you
01:06:25 I want fan art
01:06:26 I want fan fiction
01:06:27 I want fan games
01:06:28 I want everything you can possibly do
01:06:30 Whatever you gotta do
01:06:31 And by the way if you make a fan game
01:06:33 Make it something other than an 8-bit platformer
01:06:35 That's a rule
01:06:36 But I like those so you can do it
01:06:38 Don't listen to different
01:06:40 I like 8-bit platformers
01:06:41 Any game starring me is a fucking 10 out of 10 game
01:06:43 Which Jesse has had two games made about him
01:06:45 At this point by the way
01:06:46 Two
01:06:47 Yeah
01:06:48 Two?
01:06:49 Other than quest for donut?
01:06:50 Yeah somebody made a game where I'm beating up
01:06:52 The cinemasins guys
01:06:53 Yeah
01:06:54 Me
01:06:55 I made that
01:06:56 Oh that's right
01:06:57 Oh yeah I still haven't seen that one
01:06:59 I sort of like a really stupid Atari 2600 game
01:07:02 In terms of depth
01:07:03 I like it
01:07:04 I wanted you to make like
01:07:07 Like more of those
01:07:08 Yeah
01:07:09 Of me beating up different YouTubers
01:07:10 With different settings
01:07:11 And I wanted to like compile them
01:07:13 Into like a Mega Man
01:07:14 Where you pick the stage and stuff
01:07:16 Oh that's a cool idea
01:07:17 I'd commission that from DeVoo
01:07:18 That's worth it
01:07:19 Because you wanted me to do a Final Fantasy 7 edition
01:07:21 Where you can beat up everyone who thinks
01:07:23 Final Fantasy 7 is overrated
01:07:25 What a great idea
01:07:27 Dude commission that for when the remake comes out
01:07:30 And have that at like the beginning of the video or something
01:07:32 That'd be great
01:07:34 Okay good thoughts
01:07:36 Alright let's end it right here everybody
01:07:38 Thanks for watching folks
01:07:39 We'll be back next week talking about something else
