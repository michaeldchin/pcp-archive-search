00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm back, and the fun is over!
00:00:07 I'm the best guy ever. And also we're joined by Gibbontake. Hippocrit.
00:00:11 Hey guys, belljapes finished and there's a fucking Kickstarter. We're going to talk about that later.
00:00:16 Oh, that's right. Please, please, please.com.
00:00:19 Was that not done when they last spoke, but like it was going to be listenable by them?
00:00:24 Yes.
00:00:25 But now it's out and we've all read it, at least I have. I read the whole thing.
00:00:28 Of course.
00:00:29 Great shit, great shit. Ben Saint is here.
00:00:32 Woo! I fucked up last episode.
00:00:35 Yeah?
00:00:36 Also.
00:00:37 Very embarrassingly, unlike Hippo, who's got his shit together, last episode I said,
00:00:46 guys, when you hear this episode, there will be one of the Vaporettes from the first Vapor's book will be published on the website.
00:00:54 And I just forgot it was Friday and forgot to do it.
00:00:58 But it's there now. And for real this time, when you hear this episode, there actually will be a second one.
00:01:06 So there will be two by the time you listen to this one.
00:01:08 At stcomics.com slash something, hit fucking whatever, go to my Twitter to find the direct link.
00:01:14 Very fantastic.
00:01:15 We got Munchie. Munchie's here.
00:01:18 Nate?
00:01:19 Yeah?
00:01:20 You're going to have to answer some fucking questions.
00:01:22 I'm ready.
00:01:23 Now or later?
00:01:25 Later.
00:01:26 And did you, bro, is here.
00:01:28 Soon, soon, your time will come.
00:01:30 Hey, I'm awake at 1pm on a Sunday.
00:01:33 Imagine that.
00:01:35 What better thing could I possibly be doing?
00:01:38 You know, I've been sleeping a lot lately as a result of massive exhaustion from, you know, me and Mavva2,
00:01:43 which should be done by the time you hear this PCP, everyone.
00:01:46 Yes, it's after the end of May, but you know what, 31 days, whatever.
00:01:51 I'm doing my best.
00:01:52 Those were the questions.
00:01:54 How could this possibly fucking happen?
00:01:57 Okay, you had more time, did you not?
00:01:59 I thought we talked about this on the show that you had more time.
00:02:01 I did have more time, that's correct.
00:02:03 Wait, are we talking about the me and Mavva being late?
00:02:05 Because there happens to be a very prominent X factor in this equation.
00:02:10 There's one major thing that's different between Nate's life two years ago and Nate's life today.
00:02:16 I wonder what could possibly be delaying me and Mavva.
00:02:20 Are you saying that getting a girlfriend ruined best guy F?
00:02:23 I'm just saying that he drives her to and from work.
00:02:27 That is accurate.
00:02:30 Wait a minute, were you single a year ago?
00:02:36 Well, that was two years ago, me and Mavva2.
00:02:39 I actually met Michelle as a direct consequence of me and Mavva1 as it would happen.
00:02:44 That's right, it was two years ago.
00:02:47 You either die a fan or live long enough to see yourself become the girlfriend.
00:02:51 I am fully prepared to engage on this topic because I couldn't agree more.
00:02:58 It's true, so I started at the beginning of this month, so here's the thing.
00:03:02 I'm going to talk about this in the final episode of me and Mavva, but whatever, I don't mind.
00:03:06 I had more time because I hoped to be done with my job and have left it.
00:03:12 But because of the particular situation of my job, I suck my own dick a little bit.
00:03:17 I'm kind of an important member of a particular team, and if I'd gone, they would have been fucked.
00:03:21 So they asked me to stay.
00:03:23 Normally, you give them two weeks, I give them a month.
00:03:26 They asked for three months, basically, is how it worked out.
00:03:29 And I was just like, you know what, these guys did me right.
00:03:32 And frankly, if things don't go so great as a YouTuber, I'm going to come crawling back.
00:03:36 So I'm going to plant some seeds, plant some seeds.
00:03:39 Sure, I get that.
00:03:42 They're paying me for half-time work, and I'm working more like two-thirds work.
00:03:46 It's how it's shaped out.
00:03:48 So yes, I have a couple more hours in the day to do stuff.
00:03:52 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
00:03:54 Did you say you're working half as much and they're paying you two-thirds as much?
00:03:59 They're paying me half as much.
00:04:01 My pay was slashed by half.
00:04:03 However, the way it's shaken out, I'm actually working more than half.
00:04:06 That's kind of...
00:04:07 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
00:04:08 So they gave you a pay cut because you put in your resignation?
00:04:11 Well, because I'm working supposedly half-time, which is, you know, how it's supposed to work out.
00:04:16 But then you end up working unpaid overtime?
00:04:18 I mean, that's, yes, that is what's happening, yes.
00:04:21 Which is, I mean, I'm not thrilled about it, but the thing was already with my job.
00:04:25 My job already had it.
00:04:32 Fair.
00:04:33 Well, you know what's interesting about my job?
00:04:35 After years of, I don't know, I guess I'd call it high performance and then being happy,
00:04:40 I actually got into a category where I got a monetary bonus per quarter based on an evaluation of my job.
00:04:47 So there was an incentive.
00:04:49 If I did extra work and they were happy with me, I did get paid more.
00:04:52 I mean, it's kind of funny to think, frankly, compared to my YouTube earnings as my side gig,
00:04:57 it was like a drop in the bucket, which is like a second career entirely.
00:05:01 But it was extra money if I did better.
00:05:04 So that was nice.
00:05:05 Okay.
00:05:06 But the point is, yes, I had a few extra hours to work, not a ton, but some.
00:05:11 But that would balance out the Michelle driving.
00:05:14 The relationship factor.
00:05:16 Yeah.
00:05:17 To treat it as coldly, callously, robotically, heartlessly, demonically as possible.
00:05:22 Which you do every day in your life, so it's no way out of character for you.
00:05:27 Correct, correct.
00:05:28 The fact of the matter is a relationship does in fact take time and energy.
00:05:32 And I'd be lying if I didn't kind of wistfully remember the kind of pure robotic autistic dedication
00:05:38 to being able to simply sit down, block out every other need and concern,
00:05:43 and simply generate, you know, video.
00:05:45 And now I have at least one human relationship.
00:05:48 I cannot avoid, you know, investing time into it.
00:05:51 I wish you could see the fucking smile on my face.
00:05:53 I'm so smug about this.
00:05:55 Inarguably, it is a nightmare, Nate.
00:06:00 Indeed.
00:06:01 Well, why did you?
00:06:02 Why are you so smug?
00:06:03 Just because you gave everybody so much shit about having a girlfriend
00:06:06 and that you got one and all the same things happened.
00:06:09 Well, I mean, I just want to say, do you remember the days when, like, Digi would mention Mae
00:06:15 and you would vanguard, you would leave the charge of, like,
00:06:18 listen to this guy on top of bringing up your girlfriend again.
00:06:21 And then he brings up his girlfriend on, like, every PCP episode.
00:06:24 He did, Nate.
00:06:25 You're worse than Digi was about it then.
00:06:27 Hang on.
00:06:28 Are we just ignoring the fact that, like, in this example,
00:06:30 she's being purely brought up in a negative sense
00:06:33 as, like, the detriment that she's causing?
00:06:35 Well, sure.
00:06:36 As long as you're shitting on her, then it's okay.
00:06:37 Well, in this case, I brought her up, so it's different.
00:06:40 But, yeah, there you go.
00:06:41 There you go.
00:06:42 It's just, it's hilarious because I know that it doesn't matter.
00:06:47 Like, there's no way for you to ever have to be...
00:06:49 I know I was accepting the devil's pact here, people,
00:06:51 by getting into a relationship.
00:06:53 I don't think it's typical.
00:06:54 I'm accepting the losses.
00:06:56 Yeah, no, that's what makes it so great, is that...
00:06:58 We're just saying how the ables have turned, how the ables have turned.
00:07:00 You will never feel, um, you will never feel, like, embarrassed
00:07:03 or offended if I point these things out,
00:07:05 because you're just gonna be like, yeah, it's exactly true.
00:07:07 I've become the beast that I was, uh...
00:07:10 Yeah, that's right.
00:07:11 Making fun of all this time.
00:07:12 I'm just a bad man now, you know?
00:07:14 You know, I think the difference about me...
00:07:16 Failed masculinity at its peak.
00:07:18 There are some aspects of life where I think other people reject this,
00:07:21 but I just embrace being a bad person.
00:07:24 For example, pirating video games and movies and software and music.
00:07:29 Other people make arguments for why it's acceptable.
00:07:31 I make no such argument.
00:07:33 I accept the fact that I am a bad person for doing so.
00:07:36 Now, that's it.
00:07:37 Now, on the one hand, I respect that.
00:07:41 Actually, no, on both hands, I respect that.
00:07:44 Be a bad person.
00:07:47 Yeah, that's fair.
00:07:48 I mean, I guess one should aspire to be a good person, so...
00:07:50 I'm completely with you.
00:07:51 I have completely embraced that.
00:07:53 I just, you know, do what I want to do,
00:07:57 and you can make value judgments about it.
00:08:00 I'm not going to, you know?
00:08:02 I'll just be like, uh, bad, good?
00:08:04 What are these words?
00:08:05 I'm just doing me.
00:08:07 It's an interesting, uh...
00:08:09 I don't know, paradox isn't the right word.
00:08:12 When you get a girlfriend, you do have less time for work,
00:08:14 and you spend that time with your girlfriend.
00:08:16 But your time, I don't know...
00:08:18 It's a quality of life investment, right?
00:08:20 It's better.
00:08:21 Like, your life is better, necessarily.
00:08:23 Yes.
00:08:24 Well, that's insane.
00:08:25 I feel like it's almost, I don't know,
00:08:27 it is good to force yourself to experience pleasure,
00:08:31 because if we're up to us, we would just not do it.
00:08:34 At least I would.
00:08:35 There have been multiple times, very recently,
00:08:37 where if it were up to me,
00:08:39 I would have just worked tirelessly
00:08:41 and wanted to kill myself.
00:08:43 So in a way, yes, work was delayed,
00:08:45 and in fact, I was doing things that I could have finished.
00:08:48 I was going to finish it in this work.
00:08:49 And I haven't done it yet, because I was with my girlfriend.
00:08:52 But when I say the time has been misspent,
00:08:54 no, because I had a great time.
00:08:55 I feel like I have improved my life.
00:08:57 This week, I've worked less,
00:08:59 because I've been spending time with my girlfriend,
00:09:02 Monty.
00:09:03 It came me, yeah.
00:09:04 Exactly.
00:09:05 Exactly.
00:09:06 But on this front, though,
00:09:08 I do want to say that obviously,
00:09:10 I make all these, these are not jokes,
00:09:12 these are real consequences of investing in a relationship,
00:09:15 but I do think that it's a net positive,
00:09:17 and I'm happy to be doing it and whatnot.
00:09:18 So, yeah.
00:09:20 I mean, everything that could be said.
00:09:23 Wait, wait, wait.
00:09:24 Flash, flash cut to Michelle,
00:09:26 sitting on a beach somewhere,
00:09:29 whatever she does in her spare time,
00:09:31 with her paper.
00:09:32 With her divorce papers in hand.
00:09:34 And she goes, oh, he thinks I'm a net positive
00:09:37 and starts shredding the papers.
00:09:39 Everyone should think they're a net positive.
00:09:41 No one's perfect.
00:09:42 Everyone has negatives.
00:09:43 That's the highest problem that I can do.
00:09:45 I'm saying she puts her hand over her heart
00:09:47 and says he says I'm a net positive.
00:09:49 Right.
00:09:50 Okay.
00:09:51 Well, good.
00:09:52 Good.
00:09:53 But I did want to say, though.
00:09:54 Well, I just want to say that this doesn't, you know,
00:09:56 exclusively apply to relationships
00:09:58 in the sense of, like, romantically.
00:09:59 I mean, this happens for friends.
00:10:00 I mean, as Ben just said, it happens with me.
00:10:02 I'm over here in Boston,
00:10:04 so we're obviously hanging out more.
00:10:05 So, I mean, I'm sure the productivity
00:10:07 has extremely just dropped off the face of the earth
00:10:09 because I met him for, like, combined,
00:10:11 like, 10 hours total.
00:10:12 Absolutely.
00:10:13 However, I would never claim that you are a net positive,
00:10:16 you know what I'm saying?
00:10:17 Okay, hey.
00:10:18 My final point.
00:10:19 So, I mean, look, I can hide behind the shield
00:10:21 of, like, my job and Michelle, you know,
00:10:25 like, girlfriend time.
00:10:26 And plus, my dog also takes time.
00:10:28 So, that's another factor.
00:10:29 A dog also takes, you know,
00:10:30 you have to walk him and whatever.
00:10:31 But the real thing is...
00:10:33 You have to love him.
00:10:34 You have to love him.
00:10:35 I mean, yeah.
00:10:36 The real unadulterated truth
00:10:38 is that I have made many mistakes in this Weagawa,
00:10:41 I mean, in this Miyamafava.
00:10:43 Look like that mistake, for instance.
00:10:45 Yeah, like that one.
00:10:46 I mean, just, it has been more than anything,
00:10:49 just me getting sloppy and getting...
00:10:51 Look, I was on track with Miyamafava
00:10:54 until day, like, 21 or 22.
00:10:58 And it was at that point.
00:11:00 So, the thing that happened was, like...
00:11:02 So, okay, there's two major things that caused me to fuck up.
00:11:05 One was, I accepted the thing that I had never accepted
00:11:09 with Miyamafava 1.
00:11:11 And that was, I accepted being able to go to sleep
00:11:14 before posting a video the next morning.
00:11:17 I said that this is something I'm going to allow myself to do.
00:11:20 That was my first and biggest mistake.
00:11:22 Doing that allowed me to get lazy and sloppy.
00:11:24 I should not have done it.
00:11:26 I should have just chug coffee and got it done
00:11:29 and then slept the one or two hours that were left.
00:11:32 But the other thing beyond that is that I...
00:11:34 I think because of this initial weakness I allowed myself,
00:11:37 this mental weakness that crept into my mind,
00:11:40 I then, when I got, like, a copyright strike
00:11:42 on my Point Break video,
00:11:44 that got me a little bit upset and fucked up.
00:11:46 I was like, no, my perfect, like, plan day-dive-day
00:11:49 isn't going to work.
00:11:50 And then the next day's plan was to release the Miyamafava theme,
00:11:54 which is ready to go.
00:11:55 And the thing is, right now, it's sitting in copyright hell.
00:11:58 It cannot go live on YouTube.
00:12:00 And it's in the, like...
00:12:02 It's in the secondary stage of copyright fight
00:12:04 where, like, I'll get a strike if I lose.
00:12:06 And so, like, the reality of that video just...
00:12:10 I prepared it.
00:12:11 It has a little bit of fancy editing.
00:12:12 It's got the song.
00:12:13 I did a bunch of stuff.
00:12:14 It's ready to go.
00:12:15 And seeing that that video just wasn't able to post,
00:12:18 I was like, okay, well, there goes the video for today.
00:12:21 And then as a result of, like, the next day or two,
00:12:23 I was just kind of fucked up and, like,
00:12:25 I don't know what I'm gonna...
00:12:26 Yes, I'll just...
00:12:27 Yeah.
00:12:28 It was so...
00:12:29 This is all on me.
00:12:30 100%.
00:12:31 I just let things get to me and got off schedule and whatnot.
00:12:33 But it was that initial weakness.
00:12:35 Because what I should have done is...
00:12:36 You should have said, I ain't gonna let it get to me.
00:12:39 I'm still gonna creep.
00:12:40 Yeah.
00:12:41 Down in Pumpkin Hill, I got to find my lost feet.
00:12:43 I know that it's here.
00:12:45 I sense it in my feet.
00:12:46 I think I'm gonna...
00:12:47 Great inworld power allows me to feel.
00:12:49 Yeah.
00:12:50 There's no excuse for me not being, like,
00:12:52 posted a video.
00:12:53 It didn't go up.
00:12:54 Okay, I'll just make another video right now in the next,
00:12:56 like, I don't know, hour or so.
00:12:58 That's what I should have done.
00:12:59 And I didn't do it.
00:13:00 And it's my fault.
00:13:01 So I'm late.
00:13:02 And that sucks.
00:13:03 But I don't know.
00:13:04 I'm also kind of wondering how upset I should be with myself.
00:13:08 But not at all, because nobody gives a shit.
00:13:11 Yeah, nobody gives a shit.
00:13:12 I'm more upset with myself.
00:13:14 When I did the August video series, like,
00:13:17 my takeaway was that I was mad at myself for taking it so seriously.
00:13:22 That, like...
00:13:23 Really?
00:13:24 Because I tried to get...
00:13:25 I got every single video out before midnight.
00:13:28 And there was no point at which I had said I was gonna do that,
00:13:33 or when that was, like, in the promise.
00:13:35 The promise was only really to my patrons.
00:13:37 Nobody was even...
00:13:38 Nobody had really made bets on it.
00:13:40 Like, there wasn't really much at stake.
00:13:43 If I had made them late, or if I had, you know,
00:13:47 taken more time for myself.
00:13:49 It was just like...
00:13:51 I just imposed it on myself because I felt like I had to do something really crazy
00:13:55 because I really needed money.
00:13:57 And it did make me some money, but like, I didn't...
00:14:02 I don't know, you know, if money was the goal,
00:14:04 it needed to be pitched better, it needed to be more planned out.
00:14:07 And I came up with the idea for a very last minute.
00:14:10 Like, literally, like, 8 o'clock PM on July 31st.
00:14:16 I did tons of planning, but I fumbled the execution opposite of you.
00:14:20 Well, if I am allowed to pull a Nate in hell,
00:14:24 ringing that bell, best guy ever, real quick,
00:14:26 and play devil's advocate,
00:14:28 I just want to say, isn't the whole point of BMFA to be like,
00:14:32 guys, or this one specifically, like, guys, it's really happening.
00:14:36 I'm going to be a professional YouTuber.
00:14:38 You can expect this level of dedication to me,
00:14:40 and I will deliver videos on time,
00:14:42 and you know, this is big glory, like, hyping up me as an AirNet creator,
00:14:46 and that you failed to deliver that.
00:14:48 Would that not mean that it's like, oh, well,
00:14:50 he couldn't even do this, like, initial, like, high promotional thing?
00:14:53 Would that not be a failure there?
00:14:55 Well, you know what...
00:14:56 Now, okay, I mean, I would understand people making that criticism.
00:14:59 I would argue that this Miimath of a...
00:15:02 I mean, if you watch the original pitch video,
00:15:04 the thing is, I should have done this and mostly intended to do it,
00:15:08 but I leaned a lot less on the idea of, like, getting one video out per day.
00:15:13 Now, I mean, maybe that's a cop-out.
00:15:15 Everyone fucking knows what it means.
00:15:16 It's supposed to be one video per day.
00:15:18 But, I mean, I don't know.
00:15:20 I don't think it's gonna matter.
00:15:22 A long-term, no. No one's gonna care.
00:15:24 But a lot of people are already comparing it to Miimath of a one.
00:15:27 I have reached a point in my career where I literally don't have any fucking idea,
00:15:33 like, what's going through the heads of anyone who watches me anymore.
00:15:37 Like, I don't really understand the mentality of people consuming my content
00:15:41 because, like, there's the people who talk to you,
00:15:45 and that makes up such a small percentage.
00:15:47 Like, even in my patron discord, like, I have a thousand patrons.
00:15:52 There's maybe 30, 40 people who talk in the discord.
00:15:56 So, like, I can talk to them and kind of act like, oh, this is...
00:16:00 I have a sense of what my fans care about, but not really.
00:16:03 It's just those people who hang out in the discord.
00:16:06 And there's all these other patrons who I don't know what the hell they want or care about.
00:16:10 I don't know how many of them are watching each different type of video.
00:16:14 You know, I try to make multiple channels, multiple styles,
00:16:17 and, like, a lot of my videos aren't even getting pushed to my audience
00:16:21 or nobody's clicking on them.
00:16:22 You know, I've got way more subs than the amount of views I get on average.
00:16:26 And I just keep asking.
00:16:27 Like, I've gotten to a point where I just pull my readers or listeners and stuff or whatever,
00:16:33 and I just say, like, why didn't you watch this video?
00:16:35 Like, I did that.
00:16:36 I put out this hour-long Utana video,
00:16:38 and I did it because that was, like, the most requested show I had gotten.
00:16:42 Anytime I ask, like, hey, what anime would you like to see me cover the most?
00:16:47 The one I get the most is Utana.
00:16:49 So I put, like, I made a video.
00:16:51 It's got less than 20,000 views after a couple of days.
00:16:53 Damn.
00:16:54 Oh, God.
00:16:55 And, like, that's not too surprising because it's an hour-long.
00:16:58 It's about an old show that not that many people have seen.
00:17:02 I just thought that because the show has been more hyped over the years,
00:17:06 more people, you know, people specifically wanted me to talk about it.
00:17:09 Maybe I see it on Twitter.
00:17:10 Maybe I see references to it on Twitter.
00:17:12 His mid-sentence.
00:17:13 Ben, no, kill yourself.
00:17:14 Yeah, no.
00:17:15 No, well, Ben's right.
00:17:16 It is on Twitter.
00:17:19 That's what I thought, too.
00:17:20 And, again, like, it gets requested a lot, but I put out this video.
00:17:24 It doesn't get that many views.
00:17:25 So I put out a Twitter poll and I said, hey, have you watched my new Utana video yet?
00:17:30 If not, why?
00:17:31 And the options were I haven't seen Utana.
00:17:33 I don't care about Utana.
00:17:35 It's too damn long or I haven't gotten to it yet.
00:17:38 And the majority was I haven't seen Utana or don't care about it.
00:17:42 Like, 60% was I haven't seen the show.
00:17:44 So I'm like, OK, that's not necessarily surprising to me because I know that not that many people
00:17:50 have watched it.
00:17:51 It's just so weird that that is the overwhelming majority of what I get if I ask people what
00:17:57 I should cover.
00:17:58 But it just means most of my audience isn't answering.
00:18:01 You know, Digi, you're so right.
00:18:03 This phenomenon of the vocal minority is so prevalent in, like, the YouTube comments
00:18:08 sections and the kind of feedback we get when, I mean, I don't know, I don't know if it's
00:18:13 cynical or anything.
00:18:14 But the things to listen to really are the total viewership numbers you get, the like-like-to-dislike
00:18:19 ratio, and of course, like, the amount of Patreon support one gets.
00:18:23 The thing about that is, yeah, and it gets weird, though, when the Patreons make stuff
00:18:26 in it because sometimes you might make something that gets a shitload of views, but your patrons
00:18:31 don't really care about it or vice versa.
00:18:33 Right.
00:18:34 You know, I make tons of stuff that gets no views, but it's the patron's favorite.
00:18:38 So like, for me, ultimately, it just comes down to don't fucking listen to anybody.
00:18:42 Like, just do whatever I want and market it in a way that makes sense to me.
00:18:46 There's a gut instinct.
00:18:47 It's the only thing that's ever worked, and I know the data better than anybody else does,
00:18:51 because every time I open my mouth about anything, I get a thousand people telling me their idea
00:18:56 of what I can do to fix it, and always it's missing something.
00:18:59 It's always like, yeah, like, that would be a good idea if not for this other element to
00:19:03 it, and like, you guys don't know all the data that I have, so like, there's no victory
00:19:09 here.
00:19:10 I've just got to do my own thing and try to figure it out, you know?
00:19:13 Yeah, it's-
00:19:14 There's no victory here.
00:19:15 I feel quite anxious sometimes, like, whether or not to post my Patreon on certain things
00:19:21 that I do, because the Patreon, I mean, it's changed, like, hands in a sense.
00:19:27 Like, it used to be for pony compilations or analysis or whatever.
00:19:32 Now it's- then it was for hypocrite videos, but now I don't really shill it on things
00:19:36 like my Red Man comics, or like, my, uh, Bale J, or whatever, uh, because it feels like
00:19:43 I should make a separate Patreon for those things, because I know that if I post certain
00:19:49 things on the Patreon, I mean, it's a monthly thing.
00:19:51 I just need to, like, advertise it more.
00:19:53 But, like, it's kind of weird.
00:19:55 It's kind of hard to, like, market yourself as, yes, this is me, and this is- I do lots
00:20:00 of different things, and if you like any one of them, uh, pledge.
00:20:05 It sounds like how I heard the Osterios Patreon described of it just support this
00:20:09 internet man doing internet things.
00:20:11 I mean, that's kind of- I don't know whether that's, like, it's- I don't know whether
00:20:15 for me, specifically, that's, like, quite, uh, you know, a good, uh, idea.
00:20:20 Well, not a good idea, but, like, uh, it's a hard sell, because the things I've done
00:20:24 are not similar, like, comics and YouTube reviews are a little different.
00:20:29 Yeah, I mean, it depends on whether the audience is there for a specific piece of content
00:20:34 or for the creator, and that's- that's another place where it hook- like, it confuses me
00:20:38 because I always follow creators.
00:20:41 Like, I per- just if- if somebody makes something good, I follow that person because I expect
00:20:47 them to be able to make other things that are good.
00:20:50 It doesn't seem like most people really think that way, and I guess that's obvious,
00:20:55 because, like, most people don't base what they watch on, like, knowing directors or
00:20:58 knowing, you know, staff members, but, like, that's entirely how I consume media.
00:21:02 So, like, to me, if I were to make, like, a separate channel that's about some other
00:21:08 subject, like, if any of you made a separate channel, I'm going to follow all of them,
00:21:13 obviously, and it's not just because you're my friends, it's because I expect anything
00:21:17 you make to be good, so, like, it's a given.
00:21:20 Yeah, I'm going to follow that other channel.
00:21:22 Most people don't think that way.
00:21:23 Subscribe to the news update for piece of shit tabloid news by a deceptive evil man,
00:21:27 Johnny News.
00:21:28 And, like, I've come to realize the only way you can get people to care about your
00:21:32 other thing is you just have to, like, fucking shill it constantly.
00:21:37 Like, I think YMS is the only person I've ever seen who, like, launched a secondary
00:21:43 channel and built it up from nothing over, like, the period of, like, a year and a half
00:21:48 with this gaming channel, because he advertised it at the end of every single video
00:21:52 until it had steam.
00:21:54 And, like, when IAMgames launched, I had advertised it as, like, I had put it at the
00:22:01 end of a couple videos, I had put it at the very beginning of one called What is Deep,
00:22:05 which is a video I wrote just so I could put an IAMgames promo in it.
00:22:09 I did a video announcing, like, my Tales of video on the main channel.
00:22:15 And, like, at that point, I was like, okay, surely I've done enough.
00:22:19 Like, I've mentioned it a bunch of times, I started getting comments of people telling
00:22:23 me to shut up about it, so I'm like, okay, this must be good enough.
00:22:27 It never, it didn't amount to that many subscribers.
00:22:31 Like, it didn't push people to the channel.
00:22:33 The videos still aren't getting a lot, and so the question becomes, like, okay, well,
00:22:36 is it that people aren't interested in the content, or is it that I haven't promoted
00:22:41 it enough?
00:22:42 So, my latest video, I just did one on Metroid Prime.
00:22:45 I posted it to IAMgames 13 hours ago, and on there it has 1.8 thousand views.
00:22:51 I posted it to my main channel, opening with an advert for IAMgames three hours ago,
00:22:56 and it has 5.3 thousand views.
00:22:59 So, clearly-
00:23:00 Makes sense.
00:23:01 Yeah, I mean, it makes sense because I have way more subs, but it's just like, why is
00:23:06 there no follow through?
00:23:07 Like, why are people not, like, why are they watching it and not saying, okay, now I want
00:23:11 to go sub to IAMgames?
00:23:12 I just don't understand the way people think.
00:23:16 I think it's like the thing my parents used to tell me about eating your greens.
00:23:23 You have to put an unfamiliar food in front of a child who will not eat it, like a thousand
00:23:30 times, or maybe not a thousand times, but like a hundred times before they will start
00:23:34 to try it out of curiosity.
00:23:36 It's true.
00:23:37 Yeah.
00:23:38 It needs to be an overwhelming amount because it needs to be something that they can expect
00:23:41 to appear and that they will like brush off, like, almost as like a routine, like, oh yeah,
00:23:47 they're talking about this at the end of the video, whatever.
00:23:49 You're fucking totally right.
00:23:50 That's true.
00:23:51 Like, I should not have let myself be, like, again, vocal minorities, and like, I'm somebody
00:23:56 who falls for it really bad, like, if somebody leaves a comment about something and I, like,
00:24:01 in any way agree with it, I'll just do what it says.
00:24:05 Like this Utana video, I did it as a YouTube premiere because somebody said, hey, you should
00:24:10 do a premiere for, like, your next big analysis video that might, you know, help it to get
00:24:15 more attention.
00:24:16 And I was like, that sounds like a good idea.
00:24:17 Crazy suggestion.
00:24:18 So I premiered it.
00:24:20 Premier seemed to go fairly well, you know, there's a chat, it was fun.
00:24:24 But first of all, lots of negative comments about premieres, like lots of people who were
00:24:29 pissed off because they hate the premiere function.
00:24:32 I don't understand that.
00:24:34 People literally, like, don't understand what a premiere is and they just, like, get confused
00:24:40 by it.
00:24:41 It's so weird to me.
00:24:42 Every time I do a premiere, there's people in the chat like, oh, is this happening live?
00:24:46 Like they think it's live.
00:24:47 A lot of people were mad because they clicked on it and it wasn't the video.
00:24:51 Like they don't notice it says premiere until they click on it.
00:24:53 And then they get pissed off because they're not going to see it live.
00:24:58 And it's just like the feeling of having missed out on it causes them to not want to watch
00:25:01 it at all.
00:25:02 Like they get mad that they missed the premiere and then they're like, fuck it.
00:25:06 But apparently it also is really bad for you.
00:25:09 Apparently there's tons of YouTubers who have reported that it fucks up the launch of the
00:25:14 video once it actually does launch.
00:25:16 And like it doesn't repost to people's sub boxes and a bunch of people just completely
00:25:19 miss it.
00:25:20 Like the view counts always go to complete shit.
00:25:22 People will do a premiere of a video, unlist it, re-upload it and get better views from
00:25:28 the second upload than they did from the initial one.
00:25:31 So apparently it's just kind of fucking broken and a bunch of people have talked about it
00:25:37 and I didn't know.
00:25:38 It seems that way because with the quickdraw server channel where we post the art things
00:25:45 that used to, you know, the drawcasts move over to the...
00:25:47 Hey, yeah, wait, hold on.
00:25:49 Before you continue on with the story about it, I don't think people know that people
00:25:53 ask sometimes like, where's the drawcast?
00:25:56 It's over there.
00:25:57 It only went somewhere.
00:25:58 It didn't go anywhere if you know what I'm trying to say.
00:26:00 It's still happening under a new name and it's on another channel, a separate channel
00:26:04 called Quickdraw and you can do it and there are like three episodes soon before.
00:26:07 You're going to have to mention that on every episode of this show from now on.
00:26:10 Yeah, that's true.
00:26:11 That's true.
00:26:12 Yeah, guess so.
00:26:13 Link in the description to the Quickdraw.
00:26:14 Go.
00:26:15 The problem with this is we all do a lot of stuff.
00:26:20 So it's like the thought of trying to bog down our show by literally just listing everything
00:26:25 we're doing every single time.
00:26:27 And yet like...
00:26:28 That's true, sister.
00:26:29 You said it.
00:26:31 There's something about Pumpk and every single time he mentions it, there's somebody who's
00:26:35 like, I've never heard of Pumpk before and it's like, ouch.
00:26:38 That was from Homestuck?
00:26:39 Yeah.
00:26:40 I saw that comic.
00:26:42 That was funny.
00:26:43 What a legend.
00:26:44 Anyway, were you saying anything about the Quickdraw premieres?
00:26:47 Well, yeah, the Quickdraw premieres seem to have like a very small view count compared
00:26:52 to the amount of people who liked the drawcast and are in the server even.
00:26:58 But maybe it is just that people don't know on the PCP channel that it has moved.
00:27:02 But I feel like if it wasn't a premier, it may even be getting more views than it is.
00:27:08 Yeah, maybe, Doug.
00:27:09 I don't know.
00:27:10 Might be worth trying.
00:27:11 The thing is, is that I just like the idea of a premier because I would certainly like
00:27:16 to...
00:27:17 I enjoy seeing premieres when I do.
00:27:18 I like seeing like, oh, hey, there's going to be premier in like two days.
00:27:21 I think I'm going to catch that.
00:27:22 That sounds like a fun time.
00:27:23 All right.
00:27:24 Maybe for you.
00:27:25 I think...
00:27:26 I mean, it's not good for channel show.
00:27:27 I'm arguing that we like personally should do it or if the online space should do it.
00:27:33 I just think it's...
00:27:34 I don't know why people don't appreciate the same way I do.
00:27:36 They're always confused.
00:27:37 They don't know what the fuck's happening.
00:27:38 And just seems like, are you stupid?
00:27:39 I think it's the fact that it's...
00:27:40 Are you literally dumb?
00:27:41 Can you not read me?
00:27:42 Like two days ahead of time is too long.
00:27:45 Like a day on the life of the internet is like a month.
00:27:48 They'll forget.
00:27:49 I have an issue...
00:27:50 Oh, sorry.
00:27:51 Go on.
00:27:52 Go on.
00:27:53 Well, it's like notifications.
00:27:54 You can turn them on, but you have to turn them on.
00:27:55 Like set reminder.
00:27:56 I've never clicked that.
00:27:57 I keep forgetting to click that, even when I want a reminder about it.
00:28:00 Even when you're constantly told to ring that bell.
00:28:04 One of the annoying things I have is that like you get notifications of premieres the
00:28:08 same way that you get like a new video.
00:28:10 So it'll be pretty common that this doesn't really impact whether or not I want to watch.
00:28:14 I still want to watch the premiere or just the video eventually, but like when I click
00:28:18 on it and it takes me to, oh, this premieres in two days, I'm like, Jesus Christ, why would
00:28:23 you even show me this YouTube?
00:28:25 Let me know when it's actually premiering.
00:28:26 Maybe I'll watch it then.
00:28:27 This is another place where I feel like an alien because I get people who say like,
00:28:31 I didn't even know you posted this video because I didn't get a notification for it.
00:28:35 And I'm like, I don't use notifications anywhere on the internet ever.
00:28:39 Yeah.
00:28:40 Notifications are the devil to me.
00:28:43 I want to be that.
00:28:44 I'm unsubscribing from a bunch of stuff because I'm realizing what a waste of time and energy
00:28:47 it is.
00:28:48 But yeah.
00:28:49 I mean, I'm subscribed to tons of channels, but I just go to my subscription page when
00:28:54 I want to, like when I want to watch YouTube, I go to YouTube and I watch videos.
00:28:59 I can't imagine getting a notification and then dropping everything and watching a video.
00:29:03 That's what I do.
00:29:04 That's what I do.
00:29:05 That's really what you do.
00:29:06 That's insane to me.
00:29:07 I need to be fair.
00:29:08 A lot of the things I subscribe to are like ASMR people.
00:29:11 So like, oh, new ASMR, this is the new thing I can listen to and not think about it while
00:29:17 I'm listening to it.
00:29:18 What are you doing when you get the notification?
00:29:22 Like just I'll be at work, like working and then, oh, notification, oh, let's take a few
00:29:26 minutes and watch this 10 minute video or something.
00:29:29 I guess if you can dick around at your job, then that's...
00:29:33 I mean, I can absolutely dick around at my job because I got my own office.
00:29:36 That's how boomer jobs work, dude.
00:29:38 Boomer jobs can just fuck around like 80% of the time.
00:29:41 Yeah.
00:29:42 It's a corporate job.
00:29:43 And as long as you get your quota done, like by the end of the day, the thing is I do end
00:29:47 up staying late at my job because I have fucked around too much during like the normal
00:29:51 eight hours or whatever.
00:29:52 So it bites you.
00:29:53 It bites you at the end.
00:29:55 That feel when you're on Twitter and you find an artist who draws big ass titties and you
00:30:00 go and check their workout and it turns out half their shit is some fucking morbid obesity,
00:30:05 big old punch shit.
00:30:06 You know what I'm saying?
00:30:07 I feel you, man.
00:30:08 I feel you, man.
00:30:09 You know what I'm fucking dealing with over here.
00:30:10 I couldn't fucking resonate with you less right now.
00:30:13 That feel when you're on Twitter, you see an artist and they draw big old fucking titties
00:30:17 and you go to their art page and all they draw is big old titties even when it's weird,
00:30:23 even when it's strange.
00:30:24 Like, dude, this ain't no big old titties, this is just like a stick figure or something.
00:30:28 That's crazy, dude.
00:30:29 What are you doing?
00:30:30 I don't know what you're talking about.
00:30:31 I literally don't understand what you're saying.
00:30:34 Hyper people hide in the shadows and you think it might just be normal art, but it's actually
00:30:37 hyper art.
00:30:38 That feel when you go on Twitter and you see a Twitter artist with the big old titties,
00:30:43 but then most of what they put on Twitter is not art and that's just talking and I don't
00:30:48 care.
00:30:49 I don't want to read.
00:30:50 Oh, yeah.
00:30:51 Hey, it's time for a call out.
00:30:52 It's time for a call out against a Twitter up and falling for many years.
00:30:57 Mokuo bot, Mokuo bot, Mokuo is a Toho girl.
00:31:02 She's the Chinese one.
00:31:03 She's cool and I was following them for a million years.
00:31:06 Now I had known all of a sudden I'm seeing people, this Mokuo bot, this account that
00:31:10 is only tweeted Mokuo bot images or Mokuo images by the specific artist for years and
00:31:17 all of a sudden is engaged with debate.
00:31:20 Okay.
00:31:21 Okay.
00:31:22 The path of progression was simply that this person suddenly tweeted, I think it was just
00:31:27 two words, trans rights just canceled, canceled and look, I mean, that was fine, but the next
00:31:38 many tweets from this account were being angry at people who expressed, I mean, to
00:31:45 my eyes, any kind of pushback that this account would tweet, you know, a somewhat political
00:31:52 statement.
00:31:53 You know, obviously there's some nuance there.
00:31:54 That's what it seems like a rite of passage, like you walk up to the lion's den, you say
00:31:57 trans rights and you see if you can survive, you can see if you can fight them off.
00:32:01 You know, I don't think any sane person would argue with the point of the tweet.
00:32:05 I would, however, argue that this is really not what I signed up for when I pledged to
00:32:09 the Mokuo bot account.
00:32:11 And why would you think, sir or madam, that I'm here for your political opinion or, you
00:32:17 know, sure, trans rights, it's great, but I'm here for the, for the japery, the memory,
00:32:22 and I will, I would have unpledged you a million years ago if there was going to be any of
00:32:26 this kind of business.
00:32:28 And you know, it's not that I hate trans rights.
00:32:30 Well, it's not the one tweet that made you want to unsub, it's that it became like a
00:32:35 long protracted thing.
00:32:36 That's correct, Ben.
00:32:37 That is correct.
00:32:38 And you know what the good news is?
00:32:39 I did not unpledge your Mokuo bot and they've gone back to tweeting Mokuo images and I
00:32:42 couldn't be happier.
00:32:43 This is, you know, I'm loving it.
00:32:45 Digi, I'm going to need you to give me a news update and if you, and if you say that
00:32:48 you haven't followed this Twitter for years and I'm going to start barking at you like
00:32:51 a literal dog, so get ready for that if you've just treated me in this way.
00:32:56 Is Nihilist Arby's still good?
00:32:59 Oh, I haven't read it in years.
00:33:00 That joke seems played out.
00:33:04 You know, I found out, I found out today that you can't be fat and trans in New York.
00:33:11 What do you mean?
00:33:12 They did a ban on trans fats.
00:33:19 Yeah, that's what I call my label, fat, like fats.
00:33:23 I'm part of the fats community.
00:33:26 Nate, did you see these pictures from Oda of Nami age 40 and Nami age 60?
00:33:32 Oh my God, that was from the new SBS and no, I have not.
00:33:34 Where are they? Where can I see them?
00:33:36 Oh, I saw them.
00:33:37 I will link them in the chat, but you prepare to be disappointed because it's just her with
00:33:41 a different haircut.
00:33:42 I'm not surprised.
00:33:43 There's no difference whatsoever.
00:33:46 Have you one piece boys seen these fucking ramen commercials?
00:33:50 Oh, you bet your bottom dollar I have, dude.
00:33:53 I saw the Zoro one.
00:33:54 Yeah, I've only seen that one.
00:33:55 Is there more?
00:33:56 Is there more than that one?
00:33:57 Yeah, there's I think there's a handful.
00:33:59 Oh my God.
00:34:00 Well, yeah, the Zoro one of like it's actually it's I've studied that many times.
00:34:05 So okay, so there's a there's a cup noodle commercial featuring Zoro as like a high
00:34:10 school boy in, you know, like one piece high school and he's in like the Kendo club and
00:34:14 he got beat by Mihawk blah, blah, blah and he's hanging around.
00:34:17 It's like Zoro's story condensed into like 30 seconds, but if he was a high school Kendo
00:34:23 club member instead of fucking want to be the greatest swordsman on the on the high seas.
00:34:28 And it's a lot.
00:34:29 And it's a lot.
00:34:30 Yeah, at the end, Luffy just shows up and it just has ramen, which is relevant somehow.
00:34:36 This studio was already making like anim like weird anime ramen ads like this, which were
00:34:42 usually just like short rom like romantic stories that are just like they're just beautifully
00:34:48 animated 30 second romance stories that then have like a ramen cup at the end.
00:34:53 By missing at the very end.
00:34:56 It's Japanese media.
00:34:59 Have you guys ever seen Lost in Translation with Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson?
00:35:02 No, I was just watching it the other day and obviously it's not real life, but it is fascinating.
00:35:08 I don't know.
00:35:08 I'm thinking about Japan a lot these days.
00:35:10 I love Japan.
00:35:11 You might say I love it, period, but the ceremonies, you know, a dog.
00:35:16 The the no one they do commercials.
00:35:19 J-rock.
00:35:19 J-rock.
00:35:20 Karugamesh.
00:35:21 Yeah.
00:35:22 Smile DK.
00:35:23 Yeah, thank you.
00:35:24 I'd say that of course.
00:35:27 Oh, I forgot the dog.
00:35:28 We got to do it.
00:35:29 We got to do it.
00:35:30 Oh, I forgot the dog in the, you know, the Japanese dog.
00:35:33 Oh, because all Japanese dogs.
00:35:35 We got to we got to go back and remake it for for 2019.
00:35:38 We have to put like our faces coming in and saying trans rights.
00:35:42 Trans rights.
00:35:44 What else?
00:35:45 Trans fat.
00:35:46 Puppers.
00:35:47 Just just multiple names for dogs.
00:35:50 Someone opens their mouth and you just hear the sound.
00:35:53 Come out of their mouth.
00:35:59 No, you need a guy in the very lights up blue.
00:36:01 I want you to be in like the very back of the shot at like the far end of the
00:36:05 restaurant in the gesture outfit screaming.
00:36:12 Dude, Radcon four.
00:36:13 We should do that.
00:36:14 That's the only thing we should do a Radcon four.
00:36:16 We should do nothing else.
00:36:17 But you know what?
00:36:18 I bet that Oscar voice actor lady doesn't have a lot going on.
00:36:21 And you know who else's career got canceled?
00:36:23 My boy, Vic Mignana.
00:36:24 So he's going to need a gig.
00:36:25 We could probably get him to do the voiceover.
00:36:27 I can go.
00:36:28 I can go on the dick show and I can get Nick Rakita to put me in contact with
00:36:33 Vic and then he could do the boys.
00:36:37 Have I told you guys that when I was in college, I knew a girl who she was a,
00:36:41 as I recall, she was a relatively attractive, like cosplay kind of girl who
00:36:48 claimed to have a personal relationship with Vic Mignana.
00:36:51 And I'm just saying it plays into, I don't even know if I believe or disbelieve
00:36:56 any of the accusations.
00:36:57 I'm just saying that if I had to guess, if this woman was at the very least
00:37:01 aspiring to fuck Mignana, I would say 100%, she was attempting to do so.
00:37:06 Whether or not that was reciprocated, I have no idea.
00:37:08 But they did know each other at least a little bit.
00:37:11 So I don't know.
00:37:12 I'm not even, this isn't even a criticism of anyone.
00:37:14 You should ask Josh if he took that dick if you still know her.
00:37:17 I wish I could remember her name, but...
00:37:19 The Vic dick.
00:37:20 The Vic dick.
00:37:21 Yeah.
00:37:22 The Vic dick.
00:37:23 Yeah.
00:37:24 Okay.
00:37:25 It's going around lately.
00:37:26 I want to talk now about Bill Jaype.
00:37:29 Okay.
00:37:30 And it's a webcomic that I made.
00:37:33 When will Bill Jaype get canceled?
00:37:36 Too late.
00:37:37 He's already finished.
00:37:38 It can't get canceled.
00:37:41 So what do you guys think?
00:37:44 What do you think of my comic I made?
00:37:47 You saw the fan art that I did.
00:37:49 I did.
00:37:50 I did.
00:37:51 Great.
00:37:52 Did we talk about this last episode?
00:37:53 No.
00:37:54 It was not real yet.
00:37:55 It wasn't finished at the time.
00:37:57 I'm very annoyed because the way that Twitter cropped it, you couldn't see
00:38:01 Pumpk.
00:38:02 And Pumpk is the big money maker.
00:38:05 It's like a promo image.
00:38:10 Show Don't Link Oblivion.
00:38:11 Get that Link slave.
00:38:12 All the characters displayed out in a symmetrical way with the hero and the front supporting
00:38:20 characters behind.
00:38:21 They're floating in the background.
00:38:24 The classic trope of snakes all around the border.
00:38:28 I have a lot to say about Jailbape because before the finale was released, just maybe
00:38:35 even just going back like maybe a month ago, I had not read a single page of that comic.
00:38:40 But I had the honor of doing one small part of the Jailbape animation and I saw that
00:38:48 to myself.
00:38:49 Well, you know.
00:38:50 Bill Jaype, you clawed.
00:38:51 As I said at RFCK a couple days ago, I will literally never say Bill Jaype ever.
00:38:57 You just did.
00:38:58 Okay.
00:38:59 Well, whatever.
00:39:00 Slip that.
00:39:01 Ladies and gents.
00:39:02 Anyway, so I went back and read it and I have a lot to say about Jailbape because I absolutely
00:39:07 love the comic.
00:39:09 It's really interesting to me in a lot of ways because of its basically, I'm sure you would
00:39:17 admit that a lot of it is rushed artwork in the sense that you didn't spend a year or
00:39:24 two on each panel.
00:39:25 This just plays right into what I've been saying for a while now, that art does not have to
00:39:31 be good to be good.
00:39:32 In fact, it was probably in most scenarios actually to its detriment to try and make each panel
00:39:38 individually perfect.
00:39:39 I think in every scenario it's to its detriment.
00:39:42 Yeah, I would agree.
00:39:45 You can clearly tell in Jailbape, like many panels where it's like, okay, obviously-
00:39:51 Hang on.
00:39:52 If we reduce that rule to something that's like to put in more effort in something than
00:39:57 the bare minimum to get the ideas, the essential ideas across-
00:40:00 Yes, yes.
00:40:01 Could just be a waste of time and yeah.
00:40:02 Okay, okay.
00:40:03 Yes, yes.
00:40:05 There's very many panels where you can clearly tell that you cut corners in many ways and
00:40:10 that did not impact the moment to moment of it at all because there are legitimately pages
00:40:17 upon pages of Jailbape that I would consider homestuck level of memorabilia.
00:40:24 I often regard the many Tiki poses, specifically that one page where it's completely red.
00:40:31 The lava has just broken down into an underground tunnel and a cannonball has broken the roof
00:40:36 of said underground tunnel.
00:40:37 While it's fun and Tiki is just standing there posing, it is absolutely incredible.
00:40:42 I think about that and many other pages constantly and even though if you really take a fucking
00:40:49 measuring glass and look at each of the lines, you can say, hmm, this was made in three seconds.
00:40:57 Literally does not matter.
00:41:00 One fucking molecule.
00:41:04 Again, this goes out from the art, like the story.
00:41:07 There basically is no actual story, things just happen one after another.
00:41:11 But your passion for just the character designs basically and you know what little character
00:41:17 they do have shines through and especially in this lovingly crafted animation that you
00:41:24 made.
00:41:25 It is just like the pure like energy in this project regardless of the quote unquote lower
00:41:31 case Q quality of it.
00:41:35 That doesn't matter at all.
00:41:36 What matters is that this was a new thing that you had done.
00:41:39 This was, you know, you had done can story before, but let's face it, Jailbait basically
00:41:42 outclasses it in every single way.
00:41:44 I mean can story doesn't even hold a candle.
00:41:46 Call it Baaljab for fuck's sake.
00:41:48 Never.
00:41:49 I never will.
00:41:50 Whatever.
00:41:51 Fuck you then.
00:41:52 Get the idea.
00:41:53 You get the idea, exactly.
00:41:54 It just is so refreshing in so many different ways that comic and I'm so happy that you
00:41:59 were able to finish it in such a spectacular way and I encourage every single person to
00:42:06 go and read that comic because it is the best thing that any member has done in maybe a
00:42:11 year of any member of the PCP has done.
00:42:14 Just for fun.
00:42:15 What do you think was the last good thing that was like as good that any of us have done
00:42:18 before Baaljab?
00:42:19 Anyone.
00:42:20 This goes to anybody.
00:42:21 I'm trying to think myself.
00:42:23 The timeline is hard in my mind.
00:42:25 It's fuzzy in my mind.
00:42:26 It really depends who you ask.
00:42:28 True.
00:42:29 True.
00:42:30 We're asking all.
00:42:31 Okay.
00:42:32 Me and Matthew will one maybe.
00:42:33 Okay.
00:42:34 The timeline is good.
00:42:35 The timeline is fuzzy.
00:42:37 The timeline is fuzzy.
00:42:38 So there's probably something else.
00:42:39 Are we not allowed to pick our own shit?
00:42:42 No.
00:42:43 You pick your own shit.
00:42:44 Why not?
00:42:45 Go for it.
00:42:46 I mean, champion chapter one ended and then the game came out after the game.
00:42:49 Oh, okay.
00:42:50 That's a good one.
00:42:51 No.
00:42:52 That was in like late.
00:42:53 That was like early, like the first half of 2018.
00:42:56 2018.
00:42:57 Okay.
00:42:58 No.
00:42:59 Okay.
00:43:00 Sure.
00:43:01 That's probably what I would go for, I think.
00:43:02 Are we saying that?
00:43:03 Are we trying to think of something that's as impressive as Jailbait?
00:43:06 No.
00:43:07 I mean, I knew we were refreshing in any way.
00:43:09 That's just not the same old shit, that's something that's like PCP like production
00:43:12 cannonball.
00:43:13 Oh, wait.
00:43:14 Azumi.
00:43:15 The Azumi demo was recent.
00:43:16 Yeah.
00:43:17 Azumi game.
00:43:18 Azumi game.
00:43:19 I was going to say the Davoose game as well.
00:43:20 Oh, yeah.
00:43:21 Davoose game.
00:43:22 Yeah.
00:43:23 A ton of this.
00:43:24 A ton of this game.
00:43:25 When did that come out?
00:43:26 When did that come out?
00:43:27 Yeah.
00:43:28 Personally, I would count my albums in there, but none of y'all listen to that shit.
00:43:31 Yeah.
00:43:32 Sorry, dude.
00:43:33 I just don't listen to them.
00:43:34 Yeah.
00:43:35 I'm sorry.
00:43:36 Maybe if I did, I'd love them.
00:43:37 I just haven't.
00:43:38 Sorry.
00:43:39 I don't like Digi, bro.
00:43:40 I don't like Singers.
00:43:41 Digi's too black sounding for me.
00:43:44 Well, to each his own.
00:43:47 Okay.
00:43:48 So Azumi game.
00:43:49 That's a line, guys.
00:43:50 He's not racist.
00:43:51 Please.
00:43:52 It's a quote.
00:43:53 It's a quote.
00:43:54 I mean, this doesn't have to turn into a dick measuring contest.
00:43:55 I'm just trying to say hippo.
00:43:56 I'm really proud of you.
00:43:57 Yeah.
00:43:58 I'm just capturing a flame that I feel has been slightly extinguished.
00:44:03 And I'm really happy that you are doing something so interesting and unique again.
00:44:07 And you know, I think...
00:44:08 Thank you very much.
00:44:09 It might...
00:44:10 Well, yes, I don't mean to undercut you.
00:44:11 Cut you off there.
00:44:12 No.
00:44:13 I really appreciate all those words.
00:44:17 And I agree that like initially it was just, let's just fuck around and draw some stuff
00:44:23 and see what happens.
00:44:24 And like the first half, the first few first hundred or so pages was like, let's make it
00:44:30 up as I go.
00:44:31 And now that I have some things, I started progressively to decide, okay, well, why is
00:44:36 that a thing?
00:44:37 And then I, you know, thought of what, where they are and what they're doing.
00:44:40 And then I tried my very best to incorporate everything that was brought up randomly into
00:44:46 the finale or the end or like, so everything got wrapped up.
00:44:49 My brother did notice that there was that one thing that when Tiki smashed the bottle
00:44:55 in her face and then like had the broken bottle, she put it in an inventory, that didn't come
00:44:59 back.
00:45:00 So, you know, zero out of 10 for that.
00:45:02 Yeah, true.
00:45:03 But everything else, including the table of potions...
00:45:06 Well, it's a red herring, dude.
00:45:07 It's a red herring.
00:45:08 Yeah, it's actually 10 out of 10.
00:45:10 Excuse me.
00:45:11 I mean, like...
00:45:12 Oh yeah, sorry, God.
00:45:14 When I saw that the finale was a video, I was expecting something like the Endless War
00:45:21 S-Descend, which you also made, which was...
00:45:23 Did you not know it was going to be a real animation?
00:45:26 I didn't.
00:45:27 No, which, I mean, S-Descend is great, but I can tell that it was made in a time-efficient
00:45:32 manner.
00:45:33 Like, you know, it's mostly stills with video.
00:45:35 I mean, there is some animation in there.
00:45:37 Which, I mean, the sort of goes back to like, you know, that was good enough and that was
00:45:42 a great...
00:45:44 That was good enough.
00:45:45 And so that's why I was like, why would you do more than this?
00:45:47 Because it's fucking outstanding as well.
00:45:49 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:45:50 Well, yeah, and then I saw...
00:45:51 Because it's a genie.
00:45:52 It's a Stratobloid genie.
00:45:53 I saw that it was like fully animated.
00:45:55 I was like, oh my, oh my God.
00:45:58 It took a very long time, but I, you know, if there's anything I can say is that I learned
00:46:05 how to do the pre-production on that so that it happened in an efficient manner from going
00:46:10 to uni.
00:46:11 That's my story there.
00:46:12 Don't go to college, please.
00:46:13 Don't go to college.
00:46:14 Anything but that, totally.
00:46:15 Don't go to college, but if you do accidentally go to college, if you do accidentally find
00:46:18 yourself with a degree, you may as well have remembered some of the things you learned.
00:46:23 And you may find yourself with an animation degree.
00:46:26 This is not my beautiful dorm.
00:46:28 This is not my beautiful student loan desk.
00:46:33 There is a PCP release somewhere in time around you released the Bugs Life YouTube Hippocrate
00:46:39 review.
00:46:40 Yeah.
00:46:41 Where I believe I mentioned like Hippo, you know, video games review, are they cool?
00:46:45 You know, I like video games, but your animations were so cool and you were like, yeah.
00:46:51 And then you said, yeah, but in the future, which is now, and you had released one moments
00:46:56 ago, and it's really cool.
00:46:58 It's really cool that you're doing it again.
00:46:59 It's really cool that you're doing animations and the things that are unique to you as opposed
00:47:05 to being another cog in the fucking machine.
00:47:08 I think it's only fair.
00:47:10 I think it's only fair we give Munchy, I'm going to get around 100% credit for give make
00:47:15 in this animation.
00:47:16 Oh yeah.
00:47:17 Oh yeah.
00:47:18 That's definitely what I meant by suggesting that you do animations again.
00:47:19 Yeah.
00:47:20 Yeah.
00:47:21 That's good.
00:47:22 I do want to make one point about like the whole, it doesn't need to be good to be good
00:47:25 because combined with, I think it was like way back when I was doing the drawing your
00:47:31 waifus if it was risk a video series where I drew like a copied image and then gave
00:47:38 her like risk a horns.
00:47:39 Yeah.
00:47:40 And then Munchy and Ben shadow me mercilessly about how that's not, yeah, both of you.
00:47:45 I remember.
00:47:46 Wait, wait, for what?
00:47:47 Drawing your waifus if it was risk a because like I was doing it with the idea of, of like,
00:47:52 wasn't tracing.
00:47:53 It was copying.
00:47:54 It was close by.
00:47:55 It was in my peripheral, but like you were saying that's not going to get you better
00:47:59 at drawing.
00:48:00 I was like, they're right.
00:48:02 Yeah.
00:48:03 It's pretty true.
00:48:05 From that point, I think like a thing in my brain change little, little thing where
00:48:09 it was like, so I do get 100% credit.
00:48:11 Well, I guess you do.
00:48:12 Both of you, both of you, 200% between the two of you.
00:48:16 Yes.
00:48:16 High five, Ben.
00:48:18 High five.
00:48:18 High hoof, bro.
00:48:20 But like it was the idea, the idea of I'm, you know, I've been okay at drawing for a
00:48:26 long time, but it doesn't seem like I'm getting that much better.
00:48:28 And I want to be really good in order to do certain things.
00:48:32 But it's time sticking, time sticking.
00:48:35 And I'm not like suddenly better yet, even though I'm drawing a little bit more than
00:48:38 I was.
00:48:39 Why don't I just work within my means?
00:48:41 Why don't I just like make something with the power that I have currently?
00:48:46 And then that will be my practice for the next thing I know.
00:48:50 That's it.
00:48:51 That's what I've been since.
00:48:52 That's all you can do.
00:48:54 That's what Vapors One was for me.
00:48:56 I was like, I can kind of draw.
00:48:57 I'll just, I'll just do a comic with as best I can.
00:49:00 And that'll be my practice.
00:49:01 I think we can all agree, I think we can all agree that this, this concept of sitting
00:49:05 around and waiting for the perfect time to do whatever, to hone your skints.
00:49:08 It's all a bunch of bullshit.
00:49:09 This is what I mean.
00:49:10 I don't, I don't, I like, don't believe in practice unless there's like a highly
00:49:15 specific thing that you really want to get like exactly down.
00:49:18 Look, I'm going to go be a tightrope walker today and fuck practice.
00:49:22 I don't need a net.
00:49:22 I'm just going out on my unicycle.
00:49:24 I'm going to win it.
00:49:25 I understand.
00:49:26 I believe in myself.
00:49:27 I'm speaking about this from like, I've spoken about this many times before.
00:49:30 So I don't feel like I need to do the whole preamble that I always do.
00:49:33 But I'm not anti practice or anything.
00:49:35 And I'm not anti things being good, obviously.
00:49:39 Like when I say he doesn't have to be good to be good.
00:49:40 I mean, that it doesn't have to be of, I'm saying it doesn't have to be of
00:49:43 technical prowess.
00:49:45 It does not have to be like, you know, none of Jill is like, like technically
00:49:49 impressive.
00:49:50 What even is technically impressive is such a weird idea in the first place.
00:49:55 Because it's like, it's like something that has to be determined by like
00:49:59 academic consensus.
00:50:01 Like it's like a bunch of people are specifically trying to boil down what
00:50:05 they're going to consider to be technically proficient and nobody else cares.
00:50:10 And I think there was a time where I think this is basically the difference
00:50:13 between like modernism and postmodernism is the idea of like, yeah, OK,
00:50:18 but like you guys can come up with a bunch of logic for why that is what
00:50:24 you're going to call good.
00:50:25 But we can come up with a bunch of logic for why anything could be called
00:50:29 good, like when it comes down to it, what matters is the effect it has.
00:50:34 And like individual people are going to make their own determinations about
00:50:37 whether it's good or not.
00:50:37 Anyways, they're not going to listen to what is considered to be good or bad.
00:50:43 So I think what matters when we're worried about it when you judge
00:50:47 something's quality is what the idea is.
00:50:51 If you think it's a good idea in whatever way you may categorize that
00:50:55 and if it's communicated effectively.
00:50:56 So going back to that to those Tiki page pages, what is the idea?
00:51:01 Tiki looks cool.
00:51:03 Is that a good idea?
00:51:05 Yes, Tiki is my wife is executed effectively.
00:51:08 Yes, she looks cool.
00:51:10 Done.
00:51:10 That's all that panel needed to be.
00:51:12 And you pull it off spectacularly.
00:51:15 You did not need to make, I don't know, you didn't have to make Tiki
00:51:19 atomically correct or make or make the line with or even just, you know,
00:51:22 going away from technical problems, making the line with absolutely
00:51:25 perfect on that one page.
00:51:26 That would not have made the idea communicated any better.
00:51:29 It didn't, you know, you know, it would have really improved jail, jail
00:51:33 babe, though, if you didn't connect your lines, if you use that like super
00:51:37 secret technique of not connecting my lines, because then how could I do
00:51:40 the fill in bucket?
00:51:42 Well, well, well, wait, hippo, I think you're really missing an opportunity
00:51:45 to get your content for your patrons.
00:51:47 I think that you would get way more money if you just didn't release
00:51:49 the jail babe animation for three years and they just had to be patron only.
00:51:54 Thanks, man.
00:51:57 I have all these, all these points.
00:51:59 Oh, sorry, yeah, if you want to.
00:52:00 I have one thing that, like, I made a, I also have a plush, which is
00:52:05 being kickstarted currently of punk.
00:52:08 And that's like, that's cool.
00:52:10 It's, it's, it's, you want to talk about how the kickstarter is going?
00:52:14 I got like a fifth of the way there already.
00:52:16 So that's pretty good.
00:52:17 Okay.
00:52:18 And it's running for a month, right?
00:52:20 Running for a month.
00:52:21 Likely it will get like kind of close, but might not actually go over.
00:52:26 But that's not what I want to talk about right now.
00:52:28 I just want to, I just want to highlight one comment from that
00:52:31 video where I announced it from Pan Limak, who says, sorry to say this,
00:52:38 but the art isn't nice.
00:52:39 The comic looks ugly, the game looks ugly, the animation looks ugly,
00:52:44 and the plushie looks rather ugly.
00:52:46 The thing about stories with good funny writing is that bad art
00:52:50 doesn't make them better.
00:52:51 I mean, it's bad after all.
00:52:54 It feels weird when you show up on YouTube suddenly just to throw an ad.
00:52:58 Good luck, I guess.
00:52:59 What a fucking.
00:53:00 This is your post on Hippo.
00:53:01 I kind of, it's very like, very dismissive of the thing.
00:53:06 But you know, I kind of like him because he didn't, he didn't, he didn't
00:53:10 say fuck you.
00:53:11 He just said, I don't like it.
00:53:12 True.
00:53:13 And we said it, that's nice.
00:53:14 There's kind of a difference.
00:53:16 I mean, when people say something's bad, they mean they don't like it.
00:53:20 Nobody really knows how to say that.
00:53:22 I agree, Hippo, that is what it means.
00:53:24 And I kind of want to, okay, okay.
00:53:26 Remember that, that leprechaun video I did where I said that like being
00:53:31 saying something is bad is just to say that you don't like it.
00:53:34 Someone, oh God, I should dig up this tweet.
00:53:36 I like, after that video, someone tweeted at me and he was like, this is a
00:53:41 like particular value theory in philosophy that has been disproven.
00:53:45 And then he linked me to, well, well, hold on.
00:53:47 Well, he linked me, he cited some source and I went and I tried to read it and it
00:53:53 was my, and I could tell that there was like more literature on the subject.
00:53:55 And this is something I've been thinking about ever since.
00:53:58 And I crave to make a video where I like an actual like philosophical argument
00:54:03 where I go into that like value theory of judgment and I try and I like argue in
00:54:08 favor of my theory and I try and like rebut because apparently this is like a
00:54:11 thing, this is like a thing that has been like, like literature has been written
00:54:15 about philosophical theory has been written about.
00:54:18 And this is something that I'm interested in arguing in and I just
00:54:20 haven't dived into it yet.
00:54:21 Hang on, is this about the general principle of artistic merit?
00:54:25 Or is there a specific type?
00:54:26 Well, this is about like what is, is a value judgment purely subjective?
00:54:31 Or like it is saying something is bad, identical in structure to saying I
00:54:36 don't like it or is there a distinction?
00:54:38 Is there a linguistic distinction between those two things?
00:54:41 And this comment was saying that that link has been disproven.
00:54:44 I mean, this tweet, this tweet, I said that like this, like,
00:54:47 your theory of value has been philosophically disproven.
00:54:51 I regardless of that, I don't think every person is going to use bad or
00:54:56 like I don't like it in the same way as as like some people are going to think
00:55:01 about that most people are not.
00:55:02 Say when they say I like it's bad, they mean they think it's objectively bad.
00:55:08 Like I think that's a very common belief.
00:55:10 Well, I think they think they mean that, but I think they might fail to mean
00:55:14 that even if they intend to.
00:55:16 I agree, but that that's, you know, that's like death of the authoring
00:55:20 these people's comment.
00:55:21 Like this guy, I think it's totally legit.
00:55:24 It is.
00:55:24 No, I agree with you that what this guy is saying is I don't like it.
00:55:30 But because his intent was to say that it was objectively bad.
00:55:34 I think he's a piece of shit asshole.
00:55:38 Maybe I suppose.
00:55:40 OK, but it depends on what you want to do with it.
00:55:42 It just, it just, you know, I don't because I have like kind of a small
00:55:47 audience and the people who I was showing Belle Jape to as it was being made.
00:55:51 It wasn't like that many people, obviously, since people people on my
00:55:55 hypocrite channel have no idea what about anything I do.
00:55:58 Really, you know, you know what?
00:56:01 Oh, yeah.
00:56:02 Well, it was a duh.
00:56:07 I forgot my train of thought, something about the comment being mean.
00:56:12 Oh, no, yeah, it reminded me that, yeah, people will see Belle Jape.
00:56:17 They will see the way it's drawn.
00:56:18 The fact that it's like kind of, you know, low resolution, like pixelated,
00:56:22 not super clean, doesn't look like a way to put it, but it is actually accurate.
00:56:28 Like, well, it's better than pixelated as a term, because everything's pixels.
00:56:33 But true, people will see that and they will think, you know,
00:56:37 this isn't a good quality image.
00:56:39 This guy doesn't know how to draw really.
00:56:41 And they will dismiss it offhand.
00:56:43 This is like most people, I think, would see this.
00:56:45 People who say like Kill La Kill is badly animated or like people who say.
00:56:50 Kill La Kill can get people's attention.
00:56:54 I feel like Belle Jape was like more well received in the small community,
00:57:01 but on a larger scale, may not appeal to that many people.
00:57:05 But I still feel proud about the writing I've got, like the quality
00:57:09 of the writing, the, you know, the things I've learned.
00:57:13 I mean, if you look at the first few panels and then the last few panels,
00:57:16 you can tell I've become at least a lot more confident in drawing
00:57:20 like more difficult poses and things.
00:57:23 I was going to say, I feel like you improved, like reading it through in one go.
00:57:26 You can tell that you improved a lot.
00:57:28 Yeah, I haven't done that.
00:57:29 I just want to say that like the fact that people are seeing it
00:57:32 and making negative comments means that people who aren't already into it
00:57:37 are seeing it.
00:57:38 So like, even though that comment is like it's symptomatic
00:57:41 of the fact that new people are seeing it, which is good.
00:57:44 Yeah. And you know, when new when when more people see a thing,
00:57:47 obviously they're not all going to be into it.
00:57:48 Yeah. Hey, all this is fine discussion and criticism,
00:57:52 but really it's all pointless bullshit because I have a substantive
00:57:55 lower point to make about Belle Jape and it's the only point that matters.
00:58:00 And I actually already talked to give about this,
00:58:02 but I just want to express a sentiment I had because unlike you,
00:58:06 meta commentary dumbass pieces of shit, I actually care about the actual
00:58:10 characters and have concern for their well-being.
00:58:13 And this is what it is.
00:58:15 It's that at the end of Belle Jape, I guess I won't specifically spoil it,
00:58:18 but Belle Jape takes place on a sea of lava.
00:58:22 And as we have not seen anything outside of this one island, which is in
00:58:27 we do see other islands in the distance, do we really?
00:58:31 I don't remember that in some of the wide shots.
00:58:33 You can see that there are other things like way off in the distance in the sea.
00:58:38 Is that?
00:58:39 Yeah, this is a few little pixels of black in the inverted horizon and a few things.
00:58:44 I must have missed those.
00:58:45 OK, well, my my OK, nonetheless, nonetheless, as a dumbass piece of shit,
00:58:50 idiot who didn't miss any of these.
00:58:53 I was really cared about the substance.
00:58:56 That's right. That's me.
00:58:58 I represent the common man.
00:59:00 We at the very end of the series,
00:59:03 I felt so seeing our heroes, you know, win and go off and drift off in the sea of
00:59:07 lava, I felt a deep, profound anxiety because I was like,
00:59:12 I see these guys on a world of lava with no indication of civilization
00:59:17 or potential safety.
00:59:19 And I don't know how long this this this orb of Splish is going to last.
00:59:23 You know, I don't know what their ultimate destination is.
00:59:26 The jewel of Splish is the jewel of Splish is eternal.
00:59:28 Well, OK, nice head cannon, bro.
00:59:31 Cool head cannon.
00:59:32 But you know, I'm not here.
00:59:34 Takes a hit of my jewel.
00:59:35 Ah, Splish flavor.
00:59:37 I all I'm saying is if I was begging Gibb to make an epilogue or something
00:59:42 where we see them like, you know, just I would have been this would have been
00:59:46 addressed if just on the in like the last panel, we see them drifting off.
00:59:51 And maybe there's like the silhouette of like a city looming in the distance
00:59:54 or or like something like just just a hopeful element.
00:59:57 But there was none.
00:59:58 And the fact that I missed these islands in the distance.
01:00:00 OK, I'm already I've already missed some stuff because there is hope
01:00:04 because one of those you could theoretically go to and live.
01:00:07 Just please go back and just add a black panel and then in show card
01:00:12 gothic just right and they lived happily ever after so I can rest easy at night.
01:00:17 I mean, that's a I mean, that's a bullshit way to do it.
01:00:20 I want a more artistic way to do it more, you know, yeah.
01:00:23 But yes, no, I guess.
01:00:24 Well, obviously, the more artistic way flew over your head.
01:00:27 I want him to artistically do what I want him to do to his story.
01:00:31 That's that's what they had many grand adventures.
01:00:34 Look, I'm saying as the person who cares most about these characters
01:00:39 in the world, more than anyone in the world, I am scared
01:00:44 and pissing my pants currently worried about them.
01:00:47 And I want them to be safe and happy.
01:00:49 And please, sir, help.
01:00:51 OK, I can I can tell you that scholar.
01:00:54 I mean, first of all, you need to make like an analysis video
01:00:59 like theorizing and then I can say all your theories are stupid
01:01:03 and they'll they'll reach an island.
01:01:05 You so you so you can comment, lull.
01:01:08 I didn't put I didn't think about any of this.
01:01:10 It was all I do, bro.
01:01:11 I just comment death of the author and death of the author
01:01:14 in all caps like a hundred times and say, fuck you, death of the author.
01:01:17 And then start your five hundred page Bill J.
01:01:19 fan fiction that becomes more popular than the original.
01:01:22 And I was like, oh, yeah, Nate, Saint, the bell, jake guy, cool.
01:01:27 The bell, jake theorists like like like a Game of Thrones guy.
01:01:30 Exactly. Analyzing.
01:01:31 I'm going to talk about how pretty how pretty jail babe is.
01:01:34 But it doesn't just live up to like the narrative
01:01:37 stronghold, just ironclad, a thousand times folded script.
01:01:41 That is canon story.
01:01:42 I mean, come on, it may look more visually impressive, but come on.
01:01:45 Like the real meat and potatoes narratively is in.
01:01:48 No, check off gun remains unfired in canon story.
01:01:55 We can all agree the pocket boys is the real.
01:01:58 Oh, yeah, indeed.
01:02:00 And by the way, another moment I just really loved was
01:02:04 like at the end, when the shits going down, these are spoiled.
01:02:09 OK, you know, I guess I won't say it.
01:02:10 But OK, I will say that the payoff of the of the Flamingo narrative
01:02:15 I very much enjoyed.
01:02:17 And I mean, that I kind of felt one of those like, like, oh, my God,
01:02:22 moments like you'd get in like a real story.
01:02:25 Like imagine that and it felt great.
01:02:28 We can all agree that the real HIPAA winner is all those fucking
01:02:32 Terezi, Vriska, Porns, I see a real 34 pa heal, but I have to scroll
01:02:37 past whenever I search home stuck.
01:02:39 I always see them and makes me feel uncomfortable.
01:02:41 Who uploaded those and why?
01:02:44 There was there was one moment when I was very surprised.
01:02:48 I was like, oh, my God, that happened.
01:02:52 But then I thought I was like, oh, wait, that makes perfect sense.
01:02:54 Ah, and I don't want to say what it is because it's a big spoiler.
01:02:57 But I'll just say that that did happen.
01:03:00 Type it in in chat and I'll react accordingly.
01:03:05 I've got one, too.
01:03:06 I'm also going to type it in this audio podcast and totally ruin it.
01:03:11 Oh, yeah, that was that was.
01:03:13 I was I was like, I was like, what?
01:03:15 Wait a minute, may actually in hindsight, of course, that would happen.
01:03:20 Oh, I got one, too.
01:03:21 He's coming on this.
01:03:25 That was that was a thing that happened.
01:03:27 And oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:03:28 Oh, yeah, go watch. Go read.
01:03:30 Bell shape right now.
01:03:31 Link in the description.
01:03:32 Link on street.
01:03:33 There's a hundred links on screen.
01:03:34 Oblivion fall.
01:03:35 You better put a hundred links on screen.
01:03:37 I could say like literally 100 or.
01:03:39 Why did why did these people deserve to live
01:03:42 as opposed to all the other people?
01:03:44 It's not fair.
01:03:45 It's not just wait.
01:03:46 We pay him. You do have to do.
01:03:48 There's no justice in this world.
01:03:49 That's true.
01:03:50 That's in this lava world.
01:03:52 Hey, did you did you?
01:03:54 Yeah, did you read it?
01:03:55 Have you read it yet?
01:03:56 I've only read as much as was out
01:03:59 like a month after it started because I decided I would wait for it to be over.
01:04:04 And now it's over.
01:04:05 So now I have to read it, please.
01:04:06 Please.
01:04:07 I read it.
01:04:08 Give it a little thing in about an hour and a half.
01:04:11 Making an hour announced video and then releases a premiere.
01:04:14 Why don't you make a 12 port analysis?
01:04:16 You piece of shit.
01:04:17 Maybe I will do a thoroughly analyzing
01:04:22 my little pumpkin.
01:04:24 Hey, hey, pumpkin.
01:04:28 I want my pumpkin.
01:04:29 Hey, let me tell you about something.
01:04:30 Let me tell you about something that makes me.
01:04:32 It bends here.
01:04:33 Oh, God.
01:04:34 This is this is my new this is my new crusade
01:04:37 that I've started to take up and get legitimately.
01:04:39 All right, more people on Twitter who are stupid.
01:04:42 Guys, look at this.
01:04:43 Look at this image.
01:04:44 Look at this image.
01:04:45 Look at this tweet.
01:04:46 Look at this image and tell me that you would look at this and say,
01:04:50 no, thanks, I prefer I prefer a more well proportioned woman.
01:04:54 Get fucked. You're a pervert.
01:04:56 You're a sick pervert.
01:04:57 Hang on. You don't like these big ass titties.
01:05:00 That's what I'm fucking mad about.
01:05:02 OK, like you're a big fan of these titties.
01:05:05 Little. Yes, of course I am.
01:05:06 This is great. This is disgusting.
01:05:08 This is really disgusting.
01:05:10 This is what I'm here for.
01:05:11 This is the shit. No.
01:05:12 This is the shit.
01:05:13 Some shatman shit.
01:05:15 I mean, that is not some fucking shatman shit.
01:05:18 I'm so surprised and happy that we are brothers on this issue.
01:05:21 I would have never guessed, but I'm really happy.
01:05:23 You're all perverts.
01:05:25 In regard to Paul, I'm not a fan of I get to count in the comments.
01:05:29 Yeah, all you sick fucks in the comments who are like, no, thanks.
01:05:33 An undeserving of life is what you are.
01:05:36 In regards to this specific example that you've posted,
01:05:38 I find that Betty Boop has a more attractive body type than.
01:05:42 Look, Betty Boop is looking great here.
01:05:45 Betty Boop is looking great here,
01:05:46 but Jessica Rabbit is what I am about.
01:05:49 Ben, you know what? I'm surprised.
01:05:51 I'm very surprised you say that.
01:05:53 I didn't know when did this revelation come.
01:05:56 This is the truth. This is the this is the dark truth.
01:05:59 This is the dark shameful truth that I like big old titties.
01:06:03 I stand with Ben. I stand with Ben on this one.
01:06:07 You are a nightmare.
01:06:08 Hippo, you literally remind me of like a tractor going inside my wreath, right?
01:06:13 Like you are the worst thing that could happen when it comes to sex, very problematic,
01:06:17 which is why your riskatresi images on a rule three, four pack.
01:06:21 You'll always get my fucking goat.
01:06:24 Well, I don't draw anything.
01:06:27 Anyway, anyway, guys, speaking of comics and hippo, I literally don't care.
01:06:32 Don't worry about it. I want to fight about I want to fight about this.
01:06:35 OK, I want to fucking fight whatever even is there to fight about retarded.
01:06:39 My opinion is the correct one.
01:06:41 I wouldn't really criticize anyone for being into it,
01:06:44 but I would also have no problem with someone saying that they don't like it,
01:06:47 which sounds like what the argument is.
01:06:49 So really, I have no comment.
01:06:50 I just can't wrap my head around it.
01:06:52 I just can't wrap my head around it. I can't do it.
01:06:54 Well, I guess it looks unnatural and strange is this is one of those things.
01:06:59 This is one of those things where I just I just I can't respect.
01:07:03 I can't respect a conflicting opinion.
01:07:05 I can't do it.
01:07:06 You mean like every other opinion and a thing that people have,
01:07:09 like, you know, like all the rest, you can't respect that.
01:07:11 That's right. Yes.
01:07:12 In other words, this is just like everything else, I believe.
01:07:15 Things that look unnatural and strange is like part of the reason
01:07:17 why you would draw it rather than photograph in the first place.
01:07:21 You know what? OK, if Shadmander these, if Shadmander these,
01:07:24 they would be big and like spherical and that would be horrible.
01:07:26 But in that first drawing of it, like they've got half to them,
01:07:28 like they look like they're made of flesh.
01:07:30 No, it's they're just.
01:07:33 You're fucking gross.
01:07:35 No, it's it's 10 out of 10.
01:07:37 I wouldn't use the word grow.
01:07:38 It's ten five. I'll allow it.
01:07:41 Fine. OK, good. Great. All right. All right.
01:07:43 Hey, well, that's my that's my contribution.
01:07:45 I was walking. I'll see you all later.
01:07:47 Doing thank you all for coming.
01:07:48 Doing doing the thing that I love to do more than anything else
01:07:51 in the entire world, go inside of Newberry Comics
01:07:55 and go to the Children's section.
01:07:57 Because for some reason, I was not informed of this.
01:08:01 But apparently Western comics are like fantastic and cool looking,
01:08:06 says the person who's never bought any of them.
01:08:08 He's like, go to the kids section
01:08:10 and I just see covers that look like this.
01:08:13 And I'm going to post them in the show notes for you to look at.
01:08:15 And I think myself, what? Huh?
01:08:18 This is like a loud.
01:08:20 What is not my beautiful comic?
01:08:21 Discussing audio links so that we don't have to copy it over.
01:08:24 I literally did. You fucking dumbass.
01:08:26 It's in gross assumption audio.
01:08:28 Oh, you're right. I'm wrong. OK.
01:08:29 Hey, Nate, kill yourself.
01:08:31 Anyway, that's fair.
01:08:32 So it's things like this.
01:08:34 Is this a Western comic? Yes.
01:08:36 OK, it is a children's comic.
01:08:38 Yeah, wait, wait, wait, wait.
01:08:38 What's extremely average is named at Atelier Cento?
01:08:43 Atelier Cento.
01:08:45 That's not a real name.
01:08:47 Is it one of the is he the star of one of the Atelier games?
01:08:51 Atelier. Is he Atelier Heidi's brother?
01:08:53 I have no idea.
01:08:55 The first name is what connects them.
01:08:56 But this looks so Japanese.
01:08:59 So, yeah, it's so intriguing.
01:09:01 Art style wise and subject matter wise.
01:09:03 Look at that girl. Look at how she has no people.
01:09:05 Because that's the thing that I like.
01:09:06 I like when characters don't have pupils.
01:09:08 That's what I like. That mushroom cut.
01:09:09 I had a mushroom cut when I was young.
01:09:11 I find this almost as confusing as Ben's picture of the giant tits.
01:09:15 What the hell?
01:09:17 I just don't see anything unique or appealing about it.
01:09:21 No, I think it looks nice.
01:09:23 It doesn't make me want to read it.
01:09:24 You know, OK, you know what?
01:09:25 Maybe this is a man or a woman.
01:09:27 I don't know who's like Japanese by origin
01:09:29 because it's called Daira of a yokai ghost hunter.
01:09:32 I mean, that is a Japanese name.
01:09:34 I mean, his name is Cento.
01:09:35 That's a Japanese name.
01:09:36 And yeah, his name is Cento.
01:09:37 So he's either Japanese or like descendant of Japanese people or something.
01:09:40 Well, the reason I'm sure that you're right, Digi,
01:09:43 that it has to be the name of a group, right?
01:09:47 Because it's a children's book.
01:09:48 They usually group atelier or worse.
01:09:50 If I had the media prowess that you did,
01:09:53 I probably would not find this interesting.
01:09:55 But the fact of the matter is is that I have been pretty stunted media growth wise
01:09:59 and I have not watched or consumed shows or comics
01:10:03 basically like almost ever like like consistently throughout my life.
01:10:08 I basically have grown up on video games
01:10:11 that I have like three of them.
01:10:12 I was about to post that late night. God damn it.
01:10:15 Hey, what? Hey, hey.
01:10:16 So is it a collective or is it a French guys?
01:10:19 Yeah, inspired by their travels in Japan, apparently.
01:10:23 So their website actually, the artwork that shows up when you click on it is.
01:10:26 Yeah, I like it a lot. It looks great.
01:10:28 So so so when I see stuff like this, I think to myself, wow,
01:10:31 I legitimately haven't really seen much things that look like this.
01:10:35 And so I open it up and it's just a really nice experience.
01:10:37 And it makes me think about things I've talked about many times in the past
01:10:41 where I just feel against stifled media wise in the sense that I feel like
01:10:45 I don't make enough time for myself to actually watch shows,
01:10:49 which may seem weird to, you know, maybe other people,
01:10:51 but maybe maybe any of you guys, but I really just don't do it.
01:10:55 And so I made a pact myself.
01:10:56 I didn't buy this book, obviously, because why would I fucking buy things?
01:10:59 But by next episode, I will have watched,
01:11:02 I will have read the entirety of this book.
01:11:05 So this is the new thing.
01:11:06 Munchie Book Club, one comic at a time.
01:11:08 I'm actually doing media for Reels this time.
01:11:10 These these Atelier Cento guys also make games in this art style.
01:11:15 Hell yeah. Hell yeah.
01:11:16 They make like a mobile games.
01:11:18 Yeah, I'll put a link to their blog.
01:11:19 Oh, that's cool.
01:11:20 That's, huh?
01:11:22 Like mobile adventure games in that art style.
01:11:24 It looks pretty cool.
01:11:26 Sounds sick as hell.
01:11:28 And I'm really excited.
01:11:30 I like are they like a are they like a husband and wife do?
01:11:32 Or are they like two dudes?
01:11:34 They seem to be a man and a woman, but I don't know their relationship.
01:11:37 I don't know. I don't know.
01:11:38 I see a picture of a woman holding a tablet, playing one of these games.
01:11:42 And I wonder if she's one of them.
01:11:46 I'll be one of you.
01:11:48 I think so. YouTube channel, too.
01:11:50 Well, we have now.
01:11:51 Well, there you go.
01:11:52 Deep dive.
01:11:53 This is fucking great.
01:11:54 Long in the children's book that Munchie was interested in.
01:11:58 It looks like this is a good example of like good art plus, you know,
01:12:03 like, oh, yeah, art can be good and as well as being good.
01:12:06 I just want to say, I mean, this is exactly the way that I consume things,
01:12:11 by the way, is that like I see something, I look it up
01:12:15 and I find everything that person's ever done and then just systematically consume it all.
01:12:20 And like, that's what I was trying to get at earlier.
01:12:22 Like it's always about the artist.
01:12:24 It's like, oh, this person did something that I'm interested in at all.
01:12:27 Let me consume everything they've ever done
01:12:29 because it's all going to interest me.
01:12:31 And I think that's the I think that's a good just a piece of advice.
01:12:34 If anybody you have trouble finding things that you enjoy,
01:12:39 you know, consider looking into the people who've created the things
01:12:42 that you've enjoyed previously.
01:12:44 And they've probably made other things you enjoy.
01:12:47 I only had any respect for Weaboo's.
01:12:50 I might be able to appreciate this.
01:12:51 Ben, I know I know that you've resonate me on the not watching media front.
01:12:56 You, you should fucking watch a movie or something, dude.
01:13:00 Come on this journey.
01:13:01 Be a media, be a media meister, be a media muncher.
01:13:05 You need to consume more media.
01:13:08 It's such a weird thing to say, right?
01:13:10 It's a weird like on this show being like, oh, I don't watch shows.
01:13:14 But like, it's true. It's like actually true in real life thing about you.
01:13:17 Saying this much is that I also don't consume nearly enough media.
01:13:22 I just have the appearance of doing so because I research shit all the time.
01:13:25 Like the amount of stuff I actually consume is nowhere near the amount
01:13:29 that I like watch analysis videos of or just like.
01:13:33 Yeah, I do too much of that.
01:13:34 I do too much of just listening to some guy on YouTube explain things to me.
01:13:38 Completely agree.
01:13:39 Yeah, I think I think also that the reason a lot of people have ended up
01:13:44 looking at YouTube like reviews and analysis of things
01:13:47 is because there's so much media out there that you're like,
01:13:50 ah, geez, I don't want to be stuck watching or reading the wrong thing.
01:13:53 And you go to let you like somebody to compartmentalize all of the different
01:13:59 things and tell you which one's the best game of the year.
01:14:01 Well, I don't even like it for that reason.
01:14:04 I like it because I don't have to consume any of it, except for that.
01:14:08 Like the things that I tend to be interested in are almost never
01:14:12 some kind of big blockbuster thing.
01:14:14 It's never going to be something that even will get covered by YouTubers
01:14:17 because they would get no views.
01:14:19 So like it gives me the opportunity that I can go fuck off
01:14:22 and play my stupid weird indie games that I like.
01:14:26 And then I can still be a part of the conversation about what's happening
01:14:29 in the mainstream because other people are doing the job for me.
01:14:32 So like I could I could literally sit here and have a full fledged
01:14:36 conversation with any of you about the latest Avengers movie,
01:14:39 not having seen any Marvel movies in like 10 years,
01:14:42 because I've listened to so many podcasts that describe the plot in depth
01:14:46 that I have, you know, and like I would have hated the movie.
01:14:49 I could tell by the way it's described.
01:14:50 But listening to Jesse talk about it or listening to Red Letter Media
01:14:53 talk about it is enjoyable because I like those guys.
01:14:56 So it's like it's a better way to consume it for me.
01:15:00 Non sequitur right now, I'm imagining right now an alternate reality
01:15:04 where where Jailbap was a video game released for the Game Boy.
01:15:08 And I imagine the mid 2000s commercial for that Game Boy game
01:15:11 and about how I can imagine like some like 2000s teenagers
01:15:15 like going to your pumpkin patch and being like, huh, better not stay out here
01:15:18 at night dot, dot, dot.
01:15:20 And then one of the pumpkins grows eyes and then pump chunks out.
01:15:23 And then it like flashes like it does like an eye catch for like a couple levels.
01:15:26 And then it's like Nintendo at the end.
01:15:30 Anyway, I just thought you guys would like to know that.
01:15:33 Make it real.
01:15:34 That sounds pretty good.
01:15:35 I've seen it in the podcast, everyone.
01:15:37 I if you didn't know, by the way, people of viewers who haven't yet read
01:15:41 Bill J, there is a video game inside the comic called Run Away from Snakes,
01:15:46 which is like a 3D 3D endless runner where you run away from snakes.
01:15:50 I've got my brother to make a new grounds account
01:15:52 and he has uploaded it to there at just the endless mode.
01:15:57 So that will hopefully get a lot of traction.
01:16:00 Because the high score is winning ever since ever since Tom got front
01:16:03 paged with Azuni, I've been meaning to try to put the the champion game up there.
01:16:09 I don't think it would do as well because it's not a side-scrolling platformer.
01:16:13 It's not it's not a, you know, it's more of a narrative experience.
01:16:17 So I wouldn't expect it to do as well just on that basis.
01:16:20 But still, it'd be cool.
01:16:22 Wait, there's a champion game.
01:16:23 I didn't hear about this.
01:16:25 It's page one, technically, right?
01:16:27 It is the yeah, it is like sort of a prequel story to the first chapter.
01:16:32 And yeah, when you go to stcomics.com, it is the landing page or in there in a little bit.
01:16:37 Yeah, you play as the champion.
01:16:40 What's your name, Sophia and you and you are in the arena.
01:16:44 It is sort of a it is sort of a JRPG like Final Fantasy six kind of gross.
01:16:51 Yeah. Well, well, there it is.
01:16:53 Advertise this enough.
01:16:55 Did I did I not advertise it enough?
01:16:58 I mean, I guess not.
01:16:58 If people fail to hear about it, then I suppose the answer is if you're listening
01:17:01 to this on Friday, maybe you should head over to stcomics.com, check out that game
01:17:06 and then check out the two new vaporettes that are up at the end of the vapor section.
01:17:11 The first one by Emily Rhee and the second one by Lauren Colt.
01:17:15 Just one more week until the munchy vapor.
01:17:18 Just one more week.
01:17:20 Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Next week.
01:17:23 Oh, which is by far the longest and by far the bestest, far longer than needed to be.
01:17:30 I'm going to break down why we all continually fail at this, why we're all
01:17:35 still marketing wrong, because the Vapors, there's a good chance a lot of people
01:17:42 listen to this, don't even know what the fuck it is.
01:17:44 So full bore, go back, explain what is the Vapors?
01:17:50 It's a comic that I made.
01:17:52 So if you go to stcomics.com, there's a bunch of comics that Ben's written.
01:17:55 He wrote two chapters of the Vapors, chapter three being written on the
01:18:00 Patreon, like released page for page.
01:18:02 It's been it's been released page by page on the Patreon.
01:18:05 It will be up to it will be done in two weeks from when you.
01:18:09 And a vaporette is like a one page, like short starring the characters.
01:18:15 It's a short story with guest art, yes, with a guest artist is what a vaporette is.
01:18:21 There was one by Fennel Kedenurix, one by Emily Rhee, one by Lauren Colt,
01:18:26 and one by Munchie.
01:18:28 And there's going to be a there's going to be a bunch more that come out with
01:18:30 chapter three. And it's a story about a couple of deeply neurotic
01:18:37 college autistic college kids, I guess.
01:18:41 Probably maybe autistic, maybe undiagnosed.
01:18:44 Maybe they just maybe they just have maybe not personal.
01:18:47 Maybe they just. Oh my God, you just fuck.
01:18:49 I just remembered the most important thing I had to describe.
01:18:53 Talk about on the show.
01:18:54 Yeah, please tell me you guys heard about they found the cure for autism.
01:19:00 What? Oh, I was a bang, bang energy.
01:19:02 No, no, it's way more insane than bang energy.
01:19:06 I saw a little bit of this.
01:19:08 Was this a joke? Do you just have to get it?
01:19:10 It's not a joke.
01:19:11 The cure for autism, unironically, literally is eating Normie's shit.
01:19:18 What? How can this be?
01:19:19 Because let's hear more about that.
01:19:22 They have discovered is that autism is linked to gut bacteria
01:19:27 and a lack of certain types of gut bacteria.
01:19:30 Apparently are apparently a lot of intestinal bacteria
01:19:34 as in shit have a lot to do with how our minds work.
01:19:37 And yeah, there's a certain gut bacteria that if you are lacking it,
01:19:42 then then you will I can't read this.
01:19:46 You will have autism and you can get it by ingesting feces
01:19:53 from neurotypical people.
01:19:55 Right. No, surely.
01:19:56 This sounds like an epic brand.
01:19:58 And it has autistic people.
01:19:59 No, there is no.
01:20:01 There was a full bore study where they they fed normal people feces
01:20:06 to children over the course has to be a joke.
01:20:09 It's not a fucking joke.
01:20:11 Why would they not extract the important element
01:20:15 from the feces if this is the only way to get it?
01:20:17 They made it into a pill.
01:20:18 They didn't like feed them shit. OK, OK, I'm sure.
01:20:21 Yeah, they made like a fecal metal pill.
01:20:24 There's other stuff you can find the fucking article.
01:20:26 I retweeted it from May.
01:20:27 Is it going to get a link?
01:20:28 I mean, in the show notes or something, hopefully.
01:20:31 OK, we'll get it.
01:20:32 I mean, I have heard that there are procedures wherein you literally
01:20:35 transplant feces from one person's intestines to another.
01:20:40 Like to get the good.
01:20:41 They ingested it orally in this particular experiment.
01:20:45 But if you just look up, I don't know what to look up,
01:20:47 but you could find this.
01:20:48 It's it's being reported on.
01:20:50 It's a study that was done on a bunch of autistic children,
01:20:54 all of whom showed fewer symptoms of autism
01:20:58 after about 18 months of going through this course.
01:21:01 Eight of them were so much less autistic
01:21:05 that they were no longer considered to even be on the spectrum
01:21:08 by the end of the treatment.
01:21:09 They are considered neurotypical now.
01:21:12 Is this something you have to do to a kid when they're young
01:21:15 like and still developing or like what if I don't know,
01:21:17 autistic adult become less autistic.
01:21:19 I haven't seen anything other than just the study that was done.
01:21:24 Hey, where the shit at?
01:21:26 I need to ask what you're trying to do out here trying to eat shit.
01:21:31 Please correct me.
01:21:32 So is autism defined as simply a set of behaviors?
01:21:36 Is that what that seems to be the case?
01:21:39 I don't think there's any other clearer definition than that.
01:21:42 We don't we don't understand the like underlying
01:21:44 physiological cause of it.
01:21:46 Apparently, though, it's tied to gut bacteria.
01:21:50 And you know, you know, by eating normie shit.
01:21:54 I'm prepared to entertain that this is true.
01:21:57 I kind of need more data before I'm going to be fully on board with this.
01:22:02 Go read some new look it up.
01:22:04 No, I read an article on the Economist about it.
01:22:08 On the Economist, yes.
01:22:11 What I'd rather do instead is just give I'll give these people, you know,
01:22:14 like 10 years, like go go fix autism and report back when it's done.
01:22:19 I mean, this is what I'm going to do.
01:22:20 I'm not going to read anything.
01:22:21 I mean, I'm not going to be 10 years.
01:22:23 It's going to be a year.
01:22:24 Well, great. Then they'll be able to do it within 10 years.
01:22:27 No problem. I'm sure this is not the cure.
01:22:29 And like, oh, this is it. All that other stuff and irrelevant.
01:22:32 It's just it's just the poop. It's just about poop.
01:22:34 That's all it ever was from the beginning.
01:22:36 I guess can't be that simple, right?
01:22:38 I I'm I'm still in shock mostly
01:22:43 because my diet apparently isn't working and I'm still not fixed.
01:22:47 I mean, I was doing this before anyone else.
01:22:50 And it's just not fucking working.
01:22:52 What am I doing wrong?
01:22:54 Maybe the maybe the people's shit you're eating is not a normies.
01:22:58 Yeah, sure.
01:23:00 Surely the the the not the only way to get the good gut
01:23:04 bacteria is specifically eating it from normies poop.
01:23:08 Like, is this just a dietary problem?
01:23:10 I'm not saying it.
01:23:11 Embrace it. This is the way of the future.
01:23:13 I really don't feel that uncomfortable,
01:23:15 but it's like I'm just wrapping my mind or it's like surely.
01:23:18 Like, I don't know why they did the experiment the way they did it.
01:23:20 Like, all I have is the data of what was done.
01:23:24 They fed people, married children for 18 months.
01:23:28 We're over analyzing.
01:23:29 Well, of them, eight of them were fully cured of autism.
01:23:33 Oh, look, the reason I'm giving such resistance here is because I don't want
01:23:37 a lot of people camped out around my toilet and my septic tank,
01:23:40 eating my neurotypical poop.
01:23:43 Does does this mean does this mean that if you eat autistic shit,
01:23:47 you will become more autistic? I hope so.
01:23:49 I hope I'm right.
01:23:50 We'll see what I'm thinking is the start of the fucking war.
01:23:54 A sewer war.
01:23:54 What this is going to lead to is you can customize your own neurosis.
01:23:58 Like, you can have whatever brain type you want.
01:24:01 Like, you could like, it's all going to make it go for one to the other.
01:24:05 Right. So like, you could just add or remove gut bacteria if you need to be
01:24:10 more or less autistic for your job.
01:24:14 It's like you really like a little bit.
01:24:16 Maybe if you like being autistic, like, avoid normie bathrooms
01:24:19 because you don't want to get infected with that normie gut bacteria.
01:24:23 It's like it's like you shouldn't hang out with cats because they'll give you
01:24:25 like they'll give you like brain like brain parasites that make you love cats
01:24:29 more. It's the same with normies.
01:24:31 They'll give you fucking gut parasites that will make you a normie.
01:24:34 Don't let them don't let them get you.
01:24:36 And some people, yeah, you know, fuck it.
01:24:37 I bet Nikola Tesla probably would have upped his I mean,
01:24:40 he was probably at max level autism already.
01:24:42 But, you know, like if you could increase it for more like autistic focus
01:24:46 on your work might help some people.
01:24:48 It's not all negative.
01:24:49 There's some benefits.
01:24:50 Yeah, I got to eat shit so I can be Mozart.
01:24:52 Nikola Tesla totally autistic and that guy never ate shit in his life.
01:24:56 Coincidence.
01:24:57 Imagine if he had how far we'd be ahead in the future right now.
01:25:01 Kind of tech we'd have boy.
01:25:04 You got to learn something new every day.
01:25:06 It should be utilized as a marketing strategy.
01:25:08 So it definitely took me a couple of days to fully internalize it.
01:25:11 But now you know what this means, guys?
01:25:13 The Patreon closed that shit down.
01:25:15 We can just sell our shit for fucking money now.
01:25:17 So we can give it off the cyberpunks.
01:25:19 Selling shit to cyberpunks is going to make up like 80 percent of our business now.
01:25:23 Who like, OK, are we just assuming that like
01:25:27 if you eat anybody's shit, you just become whatever they are?
01:25:30 Like, if you want to be a better like anime analyst, don't close my shit.
01:25:36 Yeah, all right.
01:25:36 I think I think it's a power up.
01:25:38 Appalachic all kinds of of unproven hearsay from this finding.
01:25:42 And you know what, we can make all kinds of shit based claims now.
01:25:46 We can send a poop based like care packages to people who we want
01:25:49 to be tweaked one way or another, you know, just send them like,
01:25:52 I don't know, who could use a dose of more Ben?
01:25:56 I mean, you know, people say that me and Ben are like two diametrically opposed.
01:25:59 What if Ben and I swap shit?
01:26:00 Just swap shit.
01:26:03 Yeah, yeah, we become the happy medium somewhere.
01:26:08 The phrase, you're full of shit is going to mean something different like five years.
01:26:12 OK, OK, you sign up to a subscription based service
01:26:14 where they have like celebrities that each contribute and you can like custom formulate a pill.
01:26:19 It's like, hmm, you know, I want to be I want to be successful.
01:26:23 I want to be a successful capitalist.
01:26:24 So like, give me like, give me like, you know, maybe give me a pill once once a day.
01:26:28 Give me that musk shit.
01:26:29 Yeah, yeah, 40 percent Elon Musk, 20 percent Jordan Peterson,
01:26:33 maybe maybe a dash of Steve Jobs, you know, Joe Rogan in there.
01:26:38 So they still like to be extracted.
01:26:39 Dude, OK, I'm shit from his corpse.
01:26:41 There's going to be literally there's going to be Ben St.
01:26:44 shit flavored vapes in the near future.
01:26:47 And you can get if you subscribe to loot shit, my new box based shit subscription service.
01:26:53 Comes with randomized normy, normy shit.
01:26:55 Normy shit should be a flavor of fuck energy in my in my discord last night.
01:27:02 We were all thrown out like ideas for for fuck energy flavors.
01:27:06 I'm I'm a fan of a water flavor, just urine.
01:27:11 How long is it going to be before I can get over the counter jankum?
01:27:16 Soon. Oh, man.
01:27:18 Well, that's a whole legalizer.
01:27:19 Man, I want to I want to start.
01:27:21 I legitimately would be so excited to start like a like a like like garage,
01:27:25 like drink canning business and just like put it in like local like vending machines.
01:27:30 Fuck energy drink the fuck energy.
01:27:32 The competition.
01:27:33 This is this is like an amazing market because.
01:27:37 Yeah, like it is.
01:27:38 Yeah, because everybody I mean, anybody who has who can prove the value
01:27:43 of their shit can sell their shit in this market place we're describing.
01:27:47 Like if if all you have to do is market yourself as somebody with desirable shit.
01:27:54 So like the competition is endless, like nobody can just make the best shit.
01:27:58 That's true.
01:27:58 Everybody's going to have somebody else who they who's shit they want.
01:28:02 They're all the kind of shit that they enjoy the most.
01:28:04 The Japanese, as always, so far ahead, you can buy you can buy sexy girl
01:28:09 shit in vending machines in little capsules, I'm sure.
01:28:13 I don't know. I know.
01:28:14 And for those who wish to be a little girl, they got your cover.
01:28:16 It's so much easier.
01:28:17 It's just girl shit.
01:28:21 Some guys who have been trying that for years and it hasn't had much effect,
01:28:24 but maybe maybe with a higher concentration.
01:28:30 Well, what have we solved it?
01:28:34 We solved every problem.
01:28:35 Each shit get fuck energy.
01:28:38 That is I think that's all for this episode.
01:28:42 Yeah, I think we've run the game over the voicemails.
01:28:45 Move on to voicemails now.
01:28:46 This this was great.
01:28:47 This was great and breezy.
01:28:47 I didn't get to like half the things I want to talk about.
01:28:49 That's how you know it's a good episode.
01:28:50 That's how it should be.
01:28:51 I like how much he's like rushing us to the end and then saying he has more to say.
01:28:57 Well, I mean, I could go on with these things.
01:28:59 Always go on for like two fucking hundred hours.
01:29:02 You know, I want to go in later.
01:29:04 I mean, I really think that we should, as we're recording these,
01:29:06 we should reach a point where we say to ourselves,
01:29:09 you know what, we've literally done enough.
01:29:11 Like we can just pick it up next week.
01:29:13 Like there's no need to, you know, jam stuff in where it does need to be.
01:29:18 Because I don't know.
01:29:19 That's how I feel anyway.
01:29:20 Around this time, it's better to leave on a high note than in a low note.
01:29:24 Even when there's more. Yeah, yeah, that's true.
01:29:27 That's true. What is it?
01:29:28 You know, I heard somebody say something the other day.
01:29:29 It was about like it was why did someone famous like retire
01:29:33 before they like like their career like totally bottomed out?
01:29:36 And I think it was I think it was on Joe Rogan, some comedian or something.
01:29:39 And it was just like because you want to retire
01:29:41 with something left in the tank, because you want to use that gas
01:29:45 you got left to like start your next thing.
01:29:47 And I think like topics on episodes.
01:29:48 I think that applies to that reasonably, reasonably successfully.
01:29:52 It's not like these things go away.
01:29:54 Yeah, exactly.
01:29:54 And I mean, if there's something topical that has to be discussed that week,
01:29:57 that should be like the first thing you discuss anyway.
01:29:59 So I wish I had been more on top of the fucking eating normally shit thing.
01:30:04 But I guess that was a strong finish.
01:30:06 All right, well, then let's get to the fucking voicemails.
01:30:07 Yeah, let's do it.
01:30:09 Read read read.
01:30:11 Yeah, bail, jpe, read the vapors.
01:30:15 Click on the vaporettes.
01:30:16 Listen to my album.
01:30:17 Click on the pump contest.
01:30:20 Digi, put that's true.
01:30:21 Digi, put them in the put them in the show.
01:30:23 Yeah, put links to my fucking put a link to the world over
01:30:26 and the unknown tape and the fuck off mix tape.
01:30:30 Digi, let's get the people something really easy.
01:30:32 Digi, if there was one project that we should that we,
01:30:36 your potential audio listener, music people should go listen to,
01:30:39 what's the one thing we should go listen to?
01:30:41 Oh, see, I'm just saying make it easy for us.
01:30:44 Give us a table.
01:30:45 You know what?
01:30:46 Because everybody's going to like a different one.
01:30:48 All right, Digi, news next episode.
01:30:51 Next episode, I will have the listen to the world over and we will discuss it.
01:30:55 Be there next time.
01:30:55 That's it.
01:30:56 The world over.
01:30:56 Listen to the world over.
01:30:57 There you go.
01:30:58 All right, cool.
01:30:58 That's my personal favorite.
01:31:01 Also on next episode,
01:31:03 I will have read the fucking yokai ghost hunter bullshit.
01:31:07 So right.
01:31:07 Tune in for that too.
01:31:08 Read the real along with me.
01:31:09 This is this is the we're laying seas right now here ladies and gentlemen.
01:31:14 And go to Gibbs fucking pump Kickstarter.
01:31:17 And give him money for plushes.
01:31:19 I want those to be real.
01:31:21 If anyone deserves it,
01:31:22 literally lower your pledge to the PCP to donate.
01:31:25 No, don't do that.
01:31:26 Earn more money.
01:31:28 That's my counter.
01:31:29 Oh, the fucking phone here.
01:31:34 However, 40.
01:31:34 What is it?
01:31:35 $40 for one?
01:31:36 That's not a bad price.
01:31:37 It's about it's about 40 bucks plus shipping.
01:31:40 For custom made plus she that doesn't sound unreasonable to me.
01:31:45 Yeah, I think if any of you have not read the comic and you're thinking,
01:31:50 I don't know about plush, there's plenty of time for you to read it
01:31:54 and then become a fan enough that you will want to buy one.
01:31:56 That's true.
01:31:57 Please consider indoctrinate yourself into buying it by reading the comic.
01:32:02 All right, let's go to the voice bells.
01:32:03 Yeah, here we go.
01:32:04 Okay, now first of all,
01:32:05 now I don't know if this was the thing you guys did last week
01:32:07 while I was away or something,
01:32:09 but there's a guy who named his thing voicemail theme contest.
01:32:15 Is this a thing that started?
01:32:16 Is this happening?
01:32:17 No.
01:32:17 No?
01:32:17 No.
01:32:18 Okay, okay.
01:32:18 Well, then forget that part because he also just called it PCP hype man.
01:32:22 So we'll use this as our prerequisite to the voicemails for today.
01:32:26 So, okay, take it away.
01:32:27 Go.
01:32:32 Everybody, let's get ready for the PCP voice mails.
01:32:40 When I say PC, you say P.
01:32:43 Oh no.
01:32:44 You say P.
01:32:45 P.
01:32:45 You say P.
01:32:46 P.
01:32:47 When I say voice, you say mails.
01:32:51 Voice.
01:32:52 Mails.
01:32:52 Voice.
01:32:53 Mails.
01:32:54 When I say patreon.com, you say slash bensake.
01:32:58 No.
01:32:58 Let's go with the top.
01:32:59 No, no.
01:33:00 Slash bensake, bro.
01:33:01 Bluey baton.
01:33:02 patreon.com.
01:33:03 Slash bensake.
01:33:04 I went to the bathroom, but I'm back.
01:33:12 It was the pep rally.
01:33:14 God damn it, I went to the bathroom.
01:33:15 I went to the bathroom and then I'm like, oh my god, he said bensake.
01:33:18 I gotta rush back and complete the challenge.
01:33:21 You made it in time for the second one.
01:33:24 Well, great.
01:33:25 I'm spent.
01:33:25 I'm tired.
01:33:27 Okay, let's go on.
01:33:28 I'm so tired, everybody.
01:33:29 So tired.
01:33:30 All right.
01:33:31 First real voicemail.
01:33:33 I think this is a follow up to last week or so.
01:33:35 It's called I, or am I a furry?
01:33:37 Okay, go.
01:33:39 Hello again.
01:33:40 It's me, the one that did you call this furry the last time.
01:33:44 Because you said my voice sounded like a furry.
01:33:47 So this is a complicated subject because I don't identify as a furry.
01:33:52 Because my definition of a furry is someone who actually like identifies as an animal.
01:34:00 Like I, in my definition of what a furry is, it's like other kin.
01:34:06 But from what I understand, talking to other people, she called me a furry.
01:34:11 Like people's definitions of furry is different and it appears to be a spectrum.
01:34:15 So I'm curious to know what your definition of a furry is.
01:34:18 Like I don't identify as an animal.
01:34:20 Like it'd be a dog.
01:34:21 If you find that art style to be in any way appealing, you're a furry.
01:34:26 I don't identify, I don't believe I myself am a furry because I don't want to get up
01:34:29 in a fur suit and tell people I'm a dog because I understand I'm not.
01:34:33 So what's your definition of a furry and what makes a furry and what
01:34:37 does not make a furry?
01:34:38 Oh my God, it goes on forever.
01:34:40 So I could have got that up or whatever.
01:34:42 Everyone's insane too.
01:34:45 If you are capable of appreciating the furry art style, you're a furry.
01:34:51 I mean, I could appreciate it.
01:34:53 There is no one furry art style.
01:34:55 You're not a furry just because you like Disney's Robin Hood.
01:34:59 And I do.
01:35:00 Let me tell you.
01:35:00 That's not the furry art style.
01:35:02 Okay, no, okay, listen.
01:35:05 Here's the argument, Ben, you've heard it before.
01:35:07 If you're a furry, if you say you're a furry, if you honestly believe that you are a furry,
01:35:11 it can mean whatever the fuck you want it to mean.
01:35:13 As long as you engage with the community and believe yourself to be one, then you are one.
01:35:18 You don't, furries doesn't...
01:35:20 No, stop, stop, stop.
01:35:22 Furry doesn't mean you have to be in a fur suit.
01:35:24 Furry doesn't mean that you have to draw like other furries.
01:35:26 And it doesn't mean that you have to be a fucking under-otherkin.
01:35:29 It's literally its own word.
01:35:30 What are you insane for thinking that means the same thing?
01:35:33 No, furry just means if you think you're a furry.
01:35:36 Okay, but you just said a bunch of contradictory things.
01:35:39 You said if you think you're a furry, then you are one, comma, if you engage with the community.
01:35:43 Those, like, do you have to engage with the community?
01:35:46 No, but I think it makes sense that if you engage with the community, then you would be a furry.
01:35:50 I think that...
01:35:51 What is that?
01:35:52 It doesn't have to.
01:35:53 What I said, if you think you have yourself as a furry, then you are one.
01:35:56 Let me kick the can down the road a little bit.
01:36:00 Okay, so maybe we can agree that if you think you're a furry, then you're a furry.
01:36:05 But what criteria would you use to decide whether you yourself are a furry?
01:36:09 I mean, it could depend on a lot of issues.
01:36:11 I mean, it's different for every person whether or not you're a furry.
01:36:14 Okay, well, that does gay and retarded.
01:36:17 Why is it gay and retarded?
01:36:18 That if you think that that art is appealing, you're a furry.
01:36:23 It's not that art.
01:36:24 There's a ton of different art in the furry community.
01:36:26 That would include so many people who don't consider themselves furries.
01:36:29 It's not the quality or the design of the art.
01:36:37 If you could magically have two pieces of art that are equivalent in your mind as equally good,
01:36:43 and one has a snout and one is a human, one has a tail, which one do you prefer?
01:36:49 It's a preferential thing.
01:36:50 It's not quantifiable, really.
01:36:54 It's just like would you rather see anthropomorphized animals instead of a human?
01:37:01 I don't know if I would agree with the collars claim that you have to consider yourself an animal.
01:37:06 No, not at all.
01:37:07 Of course not.
01:37:07 I think you could maybe make a case that you're not really a furry until you have a first sona.
01:37:12 No.
01:37:13 I don't know if that's necessarily true.
01:37:14 There are plenty of furries that don't have first sonsa.
01:37:16 Can we back up for a second and remember that what she asked is what do you consider to be a furry?
01:37:21 She didn't ask what is the definition which nobody can pin down at all.
01:37:26 We're all going to have our own meaning for it.
01:37:29 Let's go to the higher authority here, guys.
01:37:31 Urban Dictionary has an extensive definition of furry.
01:37:35 Let me just read the sample.
01:37:36 Hold on.
01:37:37 Wait, wait, wait.
01:37:38 Before you do, I just want to say that what I said was assuming that you at least know what a furry is
01:37:45 in an abstract.
01:37:46 Like obviously if you were just some random person and you just thought to yourself randomly,
01:37:50 like you had a seizure and your brain thought of thought that dad had no meaning to it,
01:37:54 I'm a furry now and you had no consequence of what a furry is.
01:37:57 I'm not saying that you are one now.
01:37:59 If somebody was like, well, I'm attracted to men and I love sucking cock,
01:38:05 but I'm not gay because doesn't being gay mean you have to take it in the ass?
01:38:09 I'd be like, no, you're still gay.
01:38:12 Yeah, like that's what this call was like to me.
01:38:14 It's like, hey, I like what I like the things that furries like just not this and this and this.
01:38:21 And it's like, yeah, but I mean, if you like any of it, then that's not I think as long as you're
01:38:26 for a fan of anthropomorphic animals and you consider yourself to be one than your furry.
01:38:30 I guess, I mean, basically, we're down to the to the sorting hat problem of if you don't want to
01:38:38 be one, I guess you aren't one, even if you exhibit all the signs.
01:38:41 Yes, well, okay, well, what if you like the art, but you don't consider yourself to be one?
01:38:47 Well, then you aren't one.
01:38:49 Well, okay, I guess like, I mean, if you if you if you love anime,
01:38:54 I mean, you don't have to believe that you are.
01:38:58 Are you like considered an animaniac?
01:39:00 You don't have to consider yourself to be something for other people to consider you to be it.
01:39:05 That's that's what I was going to say.
01:39:07 I think I think it I would say that it is possible for someone to be a furry and not
01:39:13 know that they are.
01:39:14 But your definition precludes that possibility, Munchie.
01:39:16 Well, I mean, they would not concern to themselves to be one.
01:39:20 No, I mean, the bottom line is.
01:39:22 So you don't you don't think that you don't think that a person can be a furry,
01:39:26 but not realize nobody can be a furry, because there is no definition of it.
01:39:32 It's only in the eye of the beholder.
01:39:34 Like, it's up to you, your definition to say therefore, no, not up to the person.
01:39:41 It's up to every single individual upon observation of a person to determine if that person's a
01:39:46 furry in your mind.
01:39:48 So I mean, I guess that person can say they're not a furry.
01:39:50 I can disagree with them about what they are.
01:39:52 They can feel that they are more correct because they are themselves.
01:39:56 But it will not change my opinion.
01:40:00 We are seeking a robust and universal theory of furredom here.
01:40:05 But it doesn't exist in an intellectual exercise.
01:40:07 It might not exist.
01:40:08 But isn't it isn't it more about the journey?
01:40:10 You know, this is a real definition of furry is the friends we made along this
01:40:14 reminds me of the label of brony, which I personally so I had an OC.
01:40:19 I mean, you know, you could argue that it was like a joke, which it was.
01:40:23 But I mean, you know, it existed.
01:40:25 I made videos about my little pony was, you know, relatively heavily engaged.
01:40:32 I never once claimed or considered myself a brony and still don't think I ever fit
01:40:37 that label personally.
01:40:39 But I'm sure many people would say that I have in hindsight.
01:40:42 I don't think I think it's pretty clear that we were bronies, even if we did take it with
01:40:47 a high sort of but see, I don't agree.
01:40:50 You watched my videos for enjoyment.
01:40:54 Why would that make you a brony?
01:40:55 We watched the show.
01:40:56 That's the only definition that I could even imagine.
01:41:00 Like what other definition is there?
01:41:02 You like the show.
01:41:03 We did it.
01:41:04 We did everything bronies do.
01:41:05 Would you would you say that a little girl who watches the show and enjoys the show
01:41:09 and then watches your videos is a brony?
01:41:11 Absolutely.
01:41:12 I think so.
01:41:13 Yeah.
01:41:14 Is there any way to watch your videos for enjoyment and not be a brony?
01:41:19 If you are watching my videos because you like the show and you like the videos because
01:41:24 they're about the show, that is exhibiting fandom for the show, which is the fandom of
01:41:29 the show is referred to as bronies.
01:41:31 I mean, you know what?
01:41:32 I guess I feel kinship with this person that I feel maybe in my mind, the definition of
01:41:36 brony had additional characteristics that maybe other people don't share.
01:41:40 Maybe I'm just wrong about it, but that's what I think.
01:41:42 This is the thing because back in the ye old days when I had a tumblr, there were certain
01:41:47 people I followed who were not bronies and brony things were like blowing up and people
01:41:53 considered bronies to be rapists at the time.
01:41:57 If you call yourself a brony, you are a rapist because you're an apedophile and it was all
01:42:04 that sort of like oh geez.
01:42:05 So like to say like if somebody asks you are you a brony, you're not just defining yourself
01:42:13 by the show, you're labeling yourself in a way that allows people who have an idea of
01:42:18 what that label is to judge you based on that idea of the label.
01:42:22 I'll say right now.
01:42:23 To not call yourself a brony is just to, you could consider yourself a brony, but if you
01:42:28 say publicly that you're a brony, people will think certain things and if you don't do that,
01:42:32 then that's just a choice.
01:42:33 I think it's stupid to label yourself at all.
01:42:35 I think that I understand why people do it for a sense of community and being a part of
01:42:41 something, but you're just giving everyone else the reins to interpret it as they see fit.
01:42:49 I would rather reject the labels.
01:42:50 If somebody wants to label me, they can believe whatever they want, but I don't want to put
01:42:56 a label on myself because I know that it means different things to different people.
01:43:03 What am I going to explain what I mean every single time I talk to somebody and a lot of
01:43:07 them are just going to disagree with my definition.
01:43:09 I call this the feminist problem because everybody who calls himself a feminist has a
01:43:14 different definition of what it means and they'll explain it to you and they'll say,
01:43:18 well, if you fit this, this, and this characteristic, that means you're a feminist,
01:43:22 but then the next person will say, well, I disagree.
01:43:24 And I just go, how about we just don't call ourselves anything.
01:43:26 Just have a set of beliefs and just be you who has that set of beliefs.
01:43:32 This desire to boil things down into a single word results inevitably in this problem.
01:43:38 So yeah, you've got to boil it back up or boil it down to the actual arguments that you're
01:43:42 trying to make and it's fucking annoying.
01:43:44 When I see a furry, I become a fury and I arch my back and I hiss and I get my claws out
01:43:51 and I'm ready to pounce on this piece.
01:43:52 I just really love insisting to people that they are furries because of the fact that people are
01:43:58 so resistant to it and they're resistant to it and they almost don't know why.
01:44:04 They're like, oh, well, well, surely, surely I'm not, it's not just the lack of liking labels,
01:44:11 it's that they want to believe that they are not so far gone when they are definitely a little
01:44:17 far gone, you know, like I'm in front of May for this constantly because she was like,
01:44:22 she was like had like a fursona kit fox when she was younger and like she insists that she's not
01:44:29 a furry, but like warrior cats are just cats.
01:44:32 They are not anthropomorphized.
01:44:34 Well, yeah, but she had a anthropomorphized kit fox character.
01:44:37 What do you mean they're not anthropomorphized?
01:44:39 Like physically, but they are given explicit personalities, names, and motivations.
01:44:44 I have never, ever seen warrior cats or know what they look like.
01:44:47 It has been explained to me that they look like normal cats.
01:44:50 Sure.
01:44:51 I'm sure they have personalities.
01:44:52 You can anthropomorphize them in other ways, it's not physical.
01:44:56 Of course, but like, is that what we mean when we say furry?
01:44:59 Someone who looks like a literal cat?
01:45:01 It could be.
01:45:02 I mean, I don't think that's that.
01:45:04 Again, we fall into the label problem, because when you think furry, you think
01:45:07 the furry art style, which this does not fall under.
01:45:10 The fun in it is just, it's just pushing people.
01:45:13 It's just pushing up again.
01:45:14 Like it's, it's funny to see, I guess, because of the fact that, you know, I don't like to
01:45:19 label myself, but like if other people want to call me something, it doesn't matter to me that
01:45:25 much.
01:45:25 And so it's really funny to me when people get so upset when you call them something,
01:45:29 like it cracks me up to see how resistant people will be.
01:45:32 To being called something.
01:45:34 And it's just like, dude, just embrace it.
01:45:36 You like furry shit.
01:45:36 Like, who cares?
01:45:37 Like, it doesn't have to say anything about you.
01:45:41 I suppose, but I mean, weren't you just arguing that you hate labels?
01:45:44 So like, why wouldn't they also do the same thing and be like, no, why box me in?
01:45:49 Let me just like my thing and not label it.
01:45:51 It's, it's not a matter of, it's like, you shouldn't care what somebody else is calling you.
01:45:57 You know, it's like.
01:45:58 You kind of want them to accept the label that you're pushing on them.
01:46:01 And you're laughing when they resist it.
01:46:04 I'm laughing because they care so much.
01:46:07 I'm laughing because they're trying so hard to not be called something.
01:46:11 When it doesn't matter, you know, I get you.
01:46:14 I also think it's a unique digi to furries in a way where it's like, it's, it's really like,
01:46:18 I saw this a lot in Bernie's where it's like, dude, what?
01:46:21 Bernie's are not furries.
01:46:24 What are you fucking talking about?
01:46:25 Leave me alone.
01:46:28 It's like, you know, listen, yeah, okay, I get you.
01:46:30 But like, it's clear you're really insecure about it.
01:46:32 It's that I don't consider it an insult to call someone a furry or a brony or whatever.
01:46:38 It's like, I respect all these different things that people like.
01:46:41 So when I see somebody who's like, so resistant to being called that thing,
01:46:45 it implies that you, you yourself don't respect that label.
01:46:49 Like you think, oh, I don't want to be a fucking furry because those guys are weird.
01:46:54 And it's like, yeah, but you're also weird.
01:46:56 So shut the fuck up.
01:46:57 You know, that's why it's funny to me.
01:46:58 Hardcore resident.
01:47:00 Good job.
01:47:00 Excellent.
01:47:01 Okay, well, hey, wait, wait, no, no, before we go to the next voicemail,
01:47:04 I just want to say that this person, first of all, I have no idea if you're a furry or not,
01:47:10 because I don't really know, you know, I mean, what do you think it doesn't mean,
01:47:14 what you think it means.
01:47:15 It's not under other kin.
01:47:17 Do you consider yourself a furry?
01:47:18 You know, ask yourself that.
01:47:19 But also you brought this up by mentioning your voice.
01:47:22 And now you have the furry voice about how furry is the voice.
01:47:25 And this is 100% true.
01:47:28 This is actually factual and this and this is and this is and this is the only red
01:47:34 quick list for being a furry is if you have the furry voice, the furry girl voice.
01:47:40 I'm not trying to shit on this person excessively much, but it's interesting that their defense
01:47:43 for not being a furry is that they do not believe themselves to be an animal,
01:47:49 which I don't really think is much of a defense against.
01:47:52 That's that's like a that's like an extremist view of what a furry is.
01:47:57 A furry is not an other can.
01:47:58 We can all agree those two things are not identical.
01:48:01 I was watching a video that she'll not be named.
01:48:04 Although, although, although actually there's I think what she's thinking of is a
01:48:08 farion because an other can is someone who believes themselves to be like a like an
01:48:12 angel or a demon.
01:48:13 A farion is someone who has like an animal spirit and identifies as an animal.
01:48:16 We can give her credit that she clearly isn't a part of a furry community
01:48:20 because yeah, that's these things like because if you were to ask a furry,
01:48:25 if a furry is the same as another can, they're going to say no,
01:48:28 like there's there's as well say I was I was watching a video and
01:48:36 farion might actually just be a subset of other other can.
01:48:39 So I might personally, by the way, extensive audio from a girl that had the furry voice
01:48:44 and it was extremely amusing the furry voice, which can be broadly also categorized as internet
01:48:50 girl. Like like when you're a girl, when you're a fan artist, like a fan girl artist on the
01:48:56 internet, you just like stop aging.
01:48:59 I'm convinced whenever you like become really interested in something and you're on DeviantArt
01:49:04 slash or Tumblr, your brain and body just stop and you turn into a 13 year old looking
01:49:11 like boy for the rest of your life and you sound like it too.
01:49:15 So you can be like 20, like seven years old, but if you liked warrior cats once,
01:49:20 then you're going to look like you're 13 and sound like you're 13 and act like you're 13 forever.
01:49:24 Like it's just it's like a bizarre genetic disease transmitted through the internet.
01:49:28 And I see it all the time.
01:49:30 We have like a vague lisp and you sort of stutter over your words and and and you just
01:49:35 can't get the words out sometimes.
01:49:37 Wait, wait, wait.
01:49:41 I think I'm going to have to reevaluate some things really soon.
01:49:46 Okay, all right, let's go on to our next fucking call here.
01:49:48 We got a handful more.
01:49:49 Okay, this one's from Chillin' Chocolate.
01:49:52 Old call, man.
01:49:53 Let's let's see what he's got for us.
01:49:54 My life is fucking L and my fucking L is my life.
01:49:58 All right.
01:49:58 You see, there's a girl I like from school, but there's only one.
01:50:03 Do I risk telling her how I feel or do I just leave things on set?
01:50:07 Do I want try to go for a short term relationship?
01:50:10 Say it.
01:50:10 Have a nice time together or, you know, with the like most beautiful and intelligent and
01:50:16 nice person I know or just fucking.
01:50:19 What do I just give up and shrivel?
01:50:22 What do I do?
01:50:24 Okay, hang on.
01:50:25 You know what?
01:50:25 Actually, giving up and shrivel sounds kind of nice.
01:50:29 I liked a girl in my art class in my senior year
01:50:32 and I regretted for years not saying anything to her.
01:50:35 Okay, what is what is this man actually asking us right now?
01:50:39 We're not doing it.
01:50:40 Can you imagine?
01:50:41 He's going to graduate, so like.
01:50:42 Right, he's graduating in a month and presumably he's going into college
01:50:45 and will be separated.
01:50:46 What he's really asking is,
01:50:48 okay, look, I get the idea of wanting to get like emotionally involved with someone
01:50:52 who you will inevitably be separated from relatively shortly.
01:50:56 Do I think this relationship is going to last very long if you get split up,
01:51:00 you know, over a distance?
01:51:01 It's certainly not.
01:51:02 But listen to the real question you're asking.
01:51:04 You're asking is, is it worth putting in the effort to like do a good thing like now,
01:51:10 just because it like won't literally last forever?
01:51:13 You're just asking us for an excuse to not put in the effort to do something you already
01:51:17 want to do.
01:51:18 And you fucking pussy.
01:51:20 You should have already asked her like months and years ago.
01:51:23 Obviously, you've wanted to for a long time.
01:51:25 Even if.
01:51:26 So fucking do it.
01:51:27 Even if all, like, even if you get emotionally invested and you get heartbroken,
01:51:30 at least you might get some like.
01:51:34 Life experience, a starter bitch.
01:51:36 Get your starter bitch out of the way, dude.
01:51:38 I mean, look, heartbreak is going to come.
01:51:40 It's going to happen.
01:51:41 Even if you had a relationship that lasted,
01:51:44 she's going to fucking die on you one day, man.
01:51:48 You're going to have 60 years.
01:51:50 These bitches just be dying on us out here.
01:51:53 I mean, at the very like, if you're really like shrively, shrively,
01:51:57 oh, I can't possibly do it.
01:51:59 Just like write it on a piece of paper like I like you, haha.
01:52:02 And then like, give it to her.
01:52:03 Say, hello, please read this.
01:52:05 And then she takes it and you run away, run away screaming because, you know,
01:52:10 at least then you'll have.
01:52:11 Okay, kind of like, think about the other thing that he brought up.
01:52:13 I guess it's better to do it in a horribly embarrassing way
01:52:17 than not at all.
01:52:19 Think about the way that he frames this though.
01:52:21 He's like, oh my God, do I want to make it awkward
01:52:23 for the last like month among these nine people?
01:52:25 Think about, shoot, the stakes,
01:52:27 the stakes have literally never been lower.
01:52:29 You're about to all split up anyway.
01:52:32 So like what, like, what is your reasoning that like now is a bad time to do it?
01:52:36 It's like the whole school is going to be up.
01:52:37 So it's nine people and you're graduating in a month.
01:52:40 Okay. Why would it even be awkward?
01:52:42 Like you asked her out.
01:52:43 She said, no, who gives a shit.
01:52:44 This transaction happens a million times a day in your school, I'm sure.
01:52:48 These things are awkward, especially for people who haven't done it much.
01:52:51 Okay, but you got to get over that too.
01:52:52 And now is your time to get over it.
01:52:54 I mean, okay, maybe you love her.
01:52:55 You think she's your specialsome pony.
01:52:57 You know, I get it.
01:52:58 I get it, my dude.
01:52:59 But like, there's no reason not to start now.
01:53:02 And I mean, just taking a step further to a place nobody wants to go.
01:53:06 Like I do think that the whole thing of forming relationships
01:53:10 and having them tragically end and feeling devastated by them emotionally,
01:53:15 I think it's ultimately good for you anyway.
01:53:17 And I really think you should just get that shit out of the way in your life
01:53:21 so that you can move on.
01:53:23 And frankly, like talk about a clean slate.
01:53:25 If you're going to college or whatever and getting split up,
01:53:28 then like there's not going to be like, I was weird, dude.
01:53:30 My, I broke up with my girlfriend in college and my senior year,
01:53:33 like she was like around.
01:53:34 And let me tell you, I made it awkward.
01:53:36 But the good news with you is you don't have to do that.
01:53:39 You're going to be free and you will stop.
01:53:42 Here's the another, here's a black pill on relationships.
01:53:45 The second that you like have a fleeting glimmer with a girl
01:53:50 past the girl that you just broke up with.
01:53:52 Like, okay, you have this, whatever, month long relationship,
01:53:55 three month long relationship until you leave.
01:53:57 You're all sad, boo-hoo, I broke up with the girl.
01:53:59 Your mammalian mating instincts will make you not give a fuck.
01:54:04 As soon as you meet some sweet young thing at your college or whatever,
01:54:07 and she's interested, you will no longer give a shit
01:54:11 that that girl broke up with you.
01:54:12 And you've got a new girl because that's just how human beings work.
01:54:16 So there you go.
01:54:18 So do it.
01:54:19 Why literally listen to this message.
01:54:21 Call her immediately.
01:54:22 You have no excuse.
01:54:23 Make her laugh in some funny way and say, ha, ha, wouldn't it be so funny
01:54:27 if we watched some piece of shit movie together?
01:54:29 Ha, ha, epic joke, whatever.
01:54:31 It doesn't matter.
01:54:32 Make up an excuse.
01:54:33 Okay, okay.
01:54:34 People have come to the piece of pee with like girl advice before,
01:54:37 which first of all, lol, but this one has like,
01:54:40 this has evolved in a way where it's like,
01:54:42 this one was like really like not like, you know, good.
01:54:46 This one was like, um, I'm so stupid.
01:54:48 I wanted to yell at this man.
01:54:49 It was like weirdly self-deprecated in a way.
01:54:52 And frankly, I'm not into it.
01:54:54 And I hate you.
01:54:55 I get where this guy is at.
01:54:57 I think the fact that he called in.
01:54:59 He was a little tongue-in-cheek.
01:55:01 I get that.
01:55:01 I get that.
01:55:02 Let's talk about Ben's Tinder profile.
01:55:03 I think that he maybe will actually get the push from this.
01:55:08 I think maybe he was, like you were saying,
01:55:10 he's looking for an excuse not to,
01:55:11 but I don't think he possibly could have thought
01:55:13 we were going to answer differently than we did.
01:55:15 I agree.
01:55:16 I agree with that.
01:55:17 How many voicemails do I have to piss?
01:55:18 We got like four.
01:55:19 If you want to go piss, I'm going to go piss.
01:55:21 Let's move on.
01:55:22 This is, we've answered this question.
01:55:23 We've definitely addressed this.
01:55:24 Okay.
01:55:24 This one's from, um, I'll, I think it's pronounced,
01:55:28 I'll die corp voicemail bot.
01:55:31 Sure, sure.
01:55:31 I'll die.
01:55:32 Yeah.
01:55:32 Okay.
01:55:33 Okay.
01:55:33 So let's, uh, let's, let's play it.
01:55:34 Go.
01:55:36 Booting up.
01:55:37 I'll die corporation voicemail bot.
01:55:44 Cool.
01:55:44 Tends to speech.
01:55:45 I hear to tell you that procreation is immoral.
01:55:47 Being brought into existence may allow you to experience good things,
01:55:51 but it also makes you vulnerable to inevitable suffering.
01:55:54 You cannot consent to being born.
01:55:55 This is trivial to point out,
01:55:57 but I fail to see how that makes it any better.
01:56:00 The only justification for birth is that humans
01:56:02 must continue to exist to create a weird utilitarian utopia.
01:56:05 Still, in a world where millions of children are in need of adoption
01:56:08 to be saved from shitty, shitty lives,
01:56:10 what moral justification have you for leaving them in the shit
01:56:13 and making a new person who may not ultimately want to exist
01:56:16 to have a good life in their stead?
01:56:18 Shutting down.
01:56:20 I'll die corporation voicemail bot.
01:56:25 Another one of these fucking unburthers.
01:56:28 Another one of these procreation is immoral people.
01:56:31 No dude, just adopt, just adopt.
01:56:33 And then when there are no more kids to adopt,
01:56:35 then you make another batch of them.
01:56:38 Well, you know, okay.
01:56:39 On this argument, I take sole responsibility
01:56:42 when it comes to procreation for the specific children
01:56:45 that I will be producing,
01:56:47 which I will be producing at some point,
01:56:49 I don't know, not too far from now,
01:56:51 within 10 years I assume.
01:56:53 So like when it comes to those children,
01:56:55 yeah, I accept full moral responsibility for producing them
01:56:59 and putting them on the earth
01:57:00 and them having to deal with like,
01:57:02 struggles and whatnot.
01:57:03 But I mean, look, you could even argue
01:57:06 that most of life is suffering.
01:57:08 However, looking at my life, for example,
01:57:11 I think that the joys I have experienced,
01:57:13 which might not even outweigh the sorrows,
01:57:16 are good enough that I'm glad that I lived.
01:57:18 That's how I feel.
01:57:19 The question is, why make a new person
01:57:25 without their consent versus adopt an existing person
01:57:30 who already exists regardless of consent?
01:57:32 Did they bring up adoption?
01:57:33 No, I didn't.
01:57:34 Yes.
01:57:34 Yeah.
01:57:35 No, it was explicit.
01:57:36 It was explicit.
01:57:37 I have an answer for that for me personally,
01:57:39 which is that there's a lot of things
01:57:45 that are already going to be going on with that kid
01:57:48 by the time you get a hold of them.
01:57:52 I think that's fine.
01:57:53 Like there's a lot of people who,
01:57:55 and maybe even for me,
01:57:56 it would be good to take it a kid like that.
01:57:58 Are you saying there's not going to be
01:57:59 a lot of shit going on with your kid, did you?
01:58:01 Well, it's more of a black slave.
01:58:01 There's not going to be a lot going on with that.
01:58:03 No.
01:58:03 What I mean to say is that all of the programming
01:58:07 will be done by me from the start?
01:58:09 No.
01:58:10 Wrong.
01:58:11 Well, more of it.
01:58:12 He or she will come with a brain that you did not design.
01:58:15 But it's a brain that came from the genetic code of me and May.
01:58:20 So, like, I know.
01:58:22 And you get it at ground zero.
01:58:23 I don't know how much that's really worth in the final analysis.
01:58:26 I think it's worth a lot of my ability to relate to.
01:58:27 What does that really mean?
01:58:29 Like, I think that if I have a kid that's, you know, that's mine,
01:58:35 like, they're going to be a lot more similar to me.
01:58:38 There's going to be a lot more ease in me being able to, you know,
01:58:44 work with it.
01:58:45 Maybe.
01:58:46 I think, I mean, again, not to say that I couldn't maybe find,
01:58:49 like, the perfect kid in an orphanage somewhere.
01:58:53 But like, for the most part, like, you know,
01:58:55 kids who are up for adoption are probably going to be from
01:58:58 pretty shitty backgrounds.
01:59:00 And, you know, it's a lot of it's going to be rehabilitation.
01:59:04 And that's, I mean, still, it's fine.
01:59:06 I think that I think, you know, if somebody's really serious about that as,
01:59:11 like, what they're trying to do as a parent is to just, like,
01:59:15 make society better by creating a, you know, a human functioning as well.
01:59:20 Yeah.
01:59:20 That's probably the best way to go for it.
01:59:21 Like, for me, having a kid, there's, you know,
01:59:24 obviously an element of ego and, like, you know,
01:59:28 wanting to create one that's as close to what I'm hoping to accomplish as possible,
01:59:34 if that makes sense.
01:59:35 I got you.
01:59:36 I got you.
01:59:37 You know, it's kind of like getting a Pokemon at level one and training it up
01:59:41 versus getting the same Pokemon at level 23.
01:59:44 Your BioKid is going to have better EVs, is what you're saying.
01:59:47 Yes.
01:59:47 That's exactly what it looks like.
01:59:48 Yeah.
01:59:50 Now I get it.
01:59:51 Let me boil this down to one phrase.
01:59:53 And it's that, uh, I care more about my shit than your shit.
01:59:57 And I make no apology for it.
01:59:59 And this applies on a genetic level.
02:00:01 You know, I just, yeah, like, did you say an vanity is definitely a part of it.
02:00:05 But also it's the fact that I plan on really optimizing my child rearing.
02:00:10 And I mean that by, like, being as good a dad as possible.
02:00:13 And, like, pragmatically speaking, even if I get a kid born one day old,
02:00:17 I think there's a couple issues of, like, uh, you know,
02:00:19 I don't know how much will be done to that kid before I get them.
02:00:22 They're probably going to have had some shit done to them already.
02:00:24 And I'm really looking to optimize my kid experience.
02:00:27 And it's simple.
02:00:28 You just, you can undo all that.
02:00:30 You just put them through unbirthing therapy.
02:00:31 That's fair.
02:00:32 I'll also say this.
02:00:32 Well, look, I'm, I'm, I'm, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm proud of my genes.
02:00:38 I think, uh, my, my family, my genes too.
02:00:40 My family's pretty long lived.
02:00:42 I'm pretty smart of a guy.
02:00:45 You know, May comes from a really tall family and she's tall for a girl.
02:00:50 So like, we'll probably have some pretty tall kids, you know,
02:00:53 probably taller than me.
02:00:54 So that's cool.
02:00:55 You know, like it's, it's a good, I think it's a good combination of genes.
02:01:00 And I'm like, I'm excited to see if I can create something better than myself.
02:01:05 What a weird way to think about it.
02:01:06 I mean, that is like the issue.
02:01:08 Isn't that just a completely normal way to approach it that everyone has
02:01:12 for all of human history?
02:01:13 It's the unconsciously normal way.
02:01:15 Cause like the only reason we like certain looks or like,
02:01:18 Oh, this person looks good.
02:01:19 This person looks healthy or whatever.
02:01:21 They're muscular.
02:01:22 That is all because they have good genes.
02:01:24 Right.
02:01:24 Therefore our kids will be human.
02:01:26 Humans are tribal, man.
02:01:27 I want my kids to generally look like me, you know,
02:01:30 I just think that's a normal thing to want.
02:01:32 I thought that like my genes were really bad or dangerous.
02:01:37 I would be a lot more hesitant to, I would probably want to adopt instead.
02:01:41 Like I would think, okay, let me find a kid who, you know, who needs a home.
02:01:45 But like if I feel like my offspring will benefit the human species, you know,
02:01:51 it's very egotistical to think.
02:01:53 But it's like, I don't know.
02:01:54 I feel some level of confidence in my genealogies deservedness to continue.
02:02:00 Okay.
02:02:01 But like it's not having the people who have,
02:02:04 who had Hitler's genes said they'll never have children.
02:02:07 Well, not, not having shitty genes,
02:02:09 like not having genes that will fuck a kid up.
02:02:12 It's not like a rare thing.
02:02:14 You like lots of people have normal, functional, healthy genes.
02:02:17 I mean, my genes, like, I don't know.
02:02:18 Let's just say that I had, you know,
02:02:19 I reproduced with like my current girlfriend,
02:02:21 you know, with Michelle or whatever, if I did that,
02:02:23 like there's potential that our particular combination of genes
02:02:26 resulted in some like awful thing for the,
02:02:28 like it's always possible.
02:02:29 You don't know.
02:02:30 I'm just saying, I don't know, might not go that way.
02:02:33 And it's just, I like familiarity.
02:02:37 So I'm going to go with kids that are my genetic kids.
02:02:40 Just seems, you know, like a logical way to go.
02:02:44 Now, now if you, to make it a larger argument though,
02:02:46 like if this isn't the net benefit for the world,
02:02:49 now on that, I get that argument that,
02:02:52 that's fair to look into more to like, you know,
02:02:54 deal with kids who are in poverty to maybe adopt them.
02:02:57 I'm not even opposed to adopting in general,
02:02:59 but I'm not going to lie selfishly.
02:03:01 I just want some kids that have my genes
02:03:03 because you know what, it's just,
02:03:04 I think I got a pretty good brain going on here.
02:03:07 And like my brain patterns,
02:03:08 obviously largely shaped by genes.
02:03:10 So it seems reasonable to pass on.
02:03:12 Here's what I mean.
02:03:13 I get, but it's not your brain.
02:03:15 What do you mean?
02:03:16 I don't know.
02:03:17 It's not like, yeah, maybe you'd have,
02:03:18 maybe you'd have a kid with a great brain.
02:03:20 So what?
02:03:21 It's not your brain.
02:03:22 It's someone else's brain.
02:03:22 Oh, well, well, I bet I think that,
02:03:24 that's a fair question, but I think it ties into the,
02:03:26 like how is it that humans,
02:03:28 like what's the purpose of human existence?
02:03:30 I mean, probably to exert our influence
02:03:32 over the world in some way.
02:03:34 And like they say that, you know,
02:03:35 reproduction is the kind of immortality
02:03:37 that humans can obtain.
02:03:38 So like I'm interested in propagating my genes to the future.
02:03:41 If for no other reason than just the vanity of like,
02:03:44 I still kind of continue to exist in this one way.
02:03:47 And you know, I could do that by,
02:03:49 let's just say being a teacher
02:03:51 and like instilling my values on kids.
02:03:53 Okay.
02:03:53 That's a great way to do it.
02:03:54 I just think another way is also genetically.
02:03:57 So I'm interested in doing that to cover all my basals.
02:03:59 I definitely see that there is like,
02:04:01 an argument to be made for like,
02:04:03 your child will not necessarily be exactly
02:04:06 how you want it to turn out.
02:04:08 Whether you rear them from your own genes
02:04:10 or whether you adopt them.
02:04:12 It could be that the person you adopt
02:04:14 will love you exactly the same way
02:04:16 and will be even a better person in the end.
02:04:18 But you can't know that either way.
02:04:20 And so in the decision making process,
02:04:23 selfishness is really the only thing that tips the scales.
02:04:27 And I mean, I'm selfish in all other aspects of my life.
02:04:29 Why not this one?
02:04:31 Yeah.
02:04:32 I mean, if you're extremely moral,
02:04:35 if you hold that higher than selfishness,
02:04:38 then you could go either way.
02:04:40 I think I wouldn't like besmirch anyone
02:04:44 for choosing one or the other, really.
02:04:45 Yeah.
02:04:46 I mean, I wouldn't say, you know,
02:04:48 I don't think it's wrong to want to have your own kids.
02:04:50 I do think that probably the ultimate moral thing to do
02:04:55 is to adopt a kid that needs a family
02:04:57 rather than produce a new one.
02:04:59 I get that.
02:05:00 Yeah, I'll say that.
02:05:01 I mean, and we also have to look at it this way.
02:05:04 I mean, in an ideal system, I think,
02:05:06 we would have some way of saying like,
02:05:10 okay, we've measured your benefit to humanity.
02:05:16 You should have kids, and you should not.
02:05:19 You should adopt.
02:05:20 And like, there's only so many kids who need to be adopted.
02:05:23 Someone still has to make babies.
02:05:26 You want to know my hot take.
02:05:29 This is my hottest take, and I think everyone will hate it.
02:05:32 And no one will like me.
02:05:34 I just think we should abolish families.
02:05:36 I really think that society would be better without...
02:05:38 Yeah, I think society would be better without them,
02:05:40 and we wouldn't miss them when they were gone.
02:05:42 I mean, look, to entertain that, okay,
02:05:44 so like, how do people get raised then?
02:05:46 What's the new model?
02:05:47 Well, wait, we don't have fucking state barracks.
02:05:50 I've got this great idea.
02:05:51 I don't know.
02:05:51 We should get these big furries called Lucises.
02:05:53 Literally, it would be cool.
02:05:55 Well, I don't like...
02:05:56 I mean, I don't like...
02:05:57 I don't know.
02:05:57 I think the fact that trolls are all like birthed in batches
02:06:01 and sort of raised as like a collective community is great.
02:06:04 I think that's awesome.
02:06:05 I think that would be so much cooler if it were like that.
02:06:07 And you know...
02:06:08 The trolls came out really great.
02:06:11 Well, they were fucked up because they were ruled by like a despot.
02:06:16 Yeah, the Alpha timeline was all right.
02:06:18 Yeah, the, you know, like people have in families,
02:06:21 they have like these like nationalistic allegiances.
02:06:23 They have family allegiances.
02:06:24 They have like racial allegiances.
02:06:26 Honestly, we should just fucking obliterate the family unit,
02:06:30 abolish culture.
02:06:31 We won't miss it when it's gone.
02:06:32 We'll have a new culture.
02:06:33 All cultures die eventually.
02:06:35 And if we just like...
02:06:36 We're like, fuck all these old cultures.
02:06:37 We're having a new one that is like communal
02:06:39 and is like shared and is not like family based.
02:06:43 And it's called Endless War.
02:06:45 We could keep the old stuff.
02:06:47 Like we wouldn't...
02:06:47 We could keep like...
02:06:48 We could keep like a...
02:06:50 I don't know, Mexican salsa dancing.
02:06:52 That doesn't have to go away.
02:06:54 You know, all the cool stuff we like about culture
02:06:56 doesn't have to go away just because we like...
02:06:58 We don't have...
02:06:59 Those cultures don't like actually exist anymore
02:07:02 because we abolish the family and are all living
02:07:05 in like a unified, like beautiful utopia
02:07:07 where we're all brothers under, you know, whatever.
02:07:10 Whatever like anarcho-communist regime we've established.
02:07:13 Ben, you gotta write a book.
02:07:15 You could be like the iron rand
02:07:16 of the authoritarian left or something.
02:07:19 Didn't they already have that
02:07:20 by the name of Karl Marx or something?
02:07:23 Okay, okay.
02:07:24 I don't know.
02:07:27 I know I say all this stuff
02:07:28 and then I get nervous when I say,
02:07:29 it's like, wait, wouldn't we have to have
02:07:30 like a really fucking totalitarian state to establish this?
02:07:34 And then I try and think about like,
02:07:35 well, how could we do all this without that?
02:07:37 And I'm sure there's a way to do that.
02:07:38 I don't like the...
02:07:39 If you actually change everyone's opinion
02:07:42 so that they wanted to be in that system,
02:07:44 I mean, I don't know how you do it,
02:07:45 but if you did that, if you convinced people
02:07:47 it was for the best.
02:07:47 I mean, the same way you would get just
02:07:50 a regular communist society.
02:07:51 Not on machines.
02:07:53 I just think families are bad.
02:07:55 Well, you know, even taking...
02:07:58 Yeah, I guess that's a fair question.
02:07:59 Because we have a fucking fractured...
02:08:01 Okay, well, this is...
02:08:03 First of all, they fractured society.
02:08:05 That's bad.
02:08:05 We have...
02:08:06 You have family allegiances,
02:08:07 nationalistic allegiances.
02:08:08 That's bad.
02:08:09 I don't think allegiances are...
02:08:10 Oh, man, I sure love being a Finn.
02:08:12 But Ben...
02:08:12 And I hate those goddamn Swedes.
02:08:14 Just because you have...
02:08:15 We don't...
02:08:15 Are you saying you want this to be like a global thing?
02:08:18 This ties into my thing
02:08:20 about how I think inheritance should be illegal
02:08:22 because it's like...
02:08:23 Illegally mean?
02:08:24 And unjust.
02:08:25 Illegally mean?
02:08:26 I said illegal.
02:08:26 And I know this has been brought up to you before, Ben.
02:08:30 But I mean, you are...
02:08:30 I mean, you're gonna inherit from our parents.
02:08:32 So I mean, is that...
02:08:33 Yes.
02:08:34 Oh, God.
02:08:35 Oh, I participate in...
02:08:36 I criticize society and yet I participate in it.
02:08:38 What a fool.
02:08:39 I mean, what...
02:08:40 Okay, but I mean, how would you...
02:08:41 If you could have complete control,
02:08:42 given the fact that you're going to inherit now,
02:08:44 what system would you replace that with
02:08:46 that you'd prefer?
02:08:48 Okay.
02:08:49 Parents don't raise their kids.
02:08:51 Okay.
02:08:52 Parents don't raise their kids.
02:08:53 No one inherits anything.
02:08:55 Everyone gets UBI.
02:08:56 There you go.
02:08:56 Okay, so basically you're saying
02:08:58 forget inheritance, instead we'll do like a UBI system.
02:09:00 Forget inheritance.
02:09:01 You don't inherit anything from your parents
02:09:03 because you don't need anything
02:09:04 because our society makes enough money
02:09:06 to provide everyone with the necessities
02:09:08 without having their parents make it for them
02:09:11 and then give it to them.
02:09:12 You know, Ben, I'll take your argument.
02:09:13 I accept it as...
02:09:15 I try to accept it at its most reasonable position,
02:09:17 granting that all of this can be done
02:09:19 and that like human nature will like allow for it.
02:09:22 I would still argue simply that I think
02:09:24 that there's a good amount of utility
02:09:26 in both like the familial structure
02:09:28 and the nation state.
02:09:29 And I just...
02:09:29 I have not yet been convinced
02:09:31 that a better system is the one you described.
02:09:33 I think.
02:09:33 And that's right.
02:09:34 I think that we could replace...
02:09:36 We could replace the family structure
02:09:38 and the nuclear family
02:09:40 with a new, more egalitarian, more just society.
02:09:44 And we would look back...
02:09:45 And we would look back on late capitalism.
02:09:48 We would look back on when we all lived in...
02:09:50 And when we're all like...
02:09:51 When we were all just raised
02:09:53 by whatever fucking chuckle fuck
02:09:54 happened to give birth to us, what the fuck?
02:09:56 We would look back on that and say,
02:09:57 wow, what like barbaric backwards times?
02:09:59 I just don't feel like the state
02:10:00 is particularly competent at these things.
02:10:03 But okay.
02:10:04 But you know what?
02:10:04 I get your point.
02:10:05 It could...
02:10:05 It could...
02:10:06 Maybe one day.
02:10:07 Maybe one day.
02:10:07 What if it wasn't a state thing?
02:10:08 What if it wasn't a state thing?
02:10:09 What if it was just like a sort of
02:10:11 like democratic like community run process?
02:10:14 What if it wasn't imposed from on high person?
02:10:18 I would prefer that, certainly.
02:10:19 I mean, they already say it takes a village
02:10:21 to raise a child.
02:10:22 What if communities just got together
02:10:24 and like established like community centers
02:10:26 where kids were like, you know, raised from birth?
02:10:29 I don't know.
02:10:30 I like it.
02:10:30 I get you.
02:10:31 I feel like inevitably there'd be some like kind of human nature
02:10:35 things that we weren't programmed to deal with
02:10:37 that we might...
02:10:37 We already do that.
02:10:38 Humans are programmed to do all kinds of horrible things
02:10:41 that we don't let them do
02:10:41 because they're fucked up and ruin everything.
02:10:44 That's fair.
02:10:44 That's fair.
02:10:45 Just like the family does
02:10:47 and just like inheritance does
02:10:49 and just like all this shit does that we do now
02:10:51 and one day we'll say,
02:10:52 thank God we don't do that anymore.
02:10:54 Well, I guess we'll say.
02:10:54 That's what I...
02:10:55 I guess we'll say.
02:10:55 That's my hot take.
02:10:56 I...
02:10:56 Fair enough.
02:10:57 Fair enough.
02:10:58 Yep.
02:10:58 Okay, sound up in the comments
02:10:59 if you think I'm a fucking psychopath or what.
02:11:02 I mean...
02:11:02 Guys, enough of this.
02:11:04 Enough of this.
02:11:04 Enough.
02:11:06 Every single episode of the Pokemon anime
02:11:08 is for free on like the Pokemon website.
02:11:11 I've just found that you can just watch them all.
02:11:14 God, that's like thousands of episodes.
02:11:15 But not in Japanese, right?
02:11:16 But the Pokemon Company International...
02:11:19 No, it's not in Japanese.
02:11:20 It's English.
02:11:20 Did this just happen?
02:11:21 I mentioned the first episode.
02:11:22 It said...
02:11:23 No, I just saw like somebody linked it and it was like...
02:11:25 You know, I have never seen episode two of Pokemon
02:11:28 and I've always wanted to.
02:11:30 Where...
02:11:30 Look, there's got no views.
02:11:31 Nobody knows about this.
02:11:32 Please put a link in the show notes.
02:11:36 Okay, let's move on to our next call.
02:11:38 We got, I think like three more or something.
02:11:40 Okay, here we go.
02:11:41 So this is Don't I Repeat Do Not Mine At Night.
02:11:47 Okay, go.
02:12:00 Is this Animal Crossing?
02:12:04 No, it's Minecraft.
02:12:05 We turn.
02:12:11 Can I just boobernate?
02:12:14 I didn't know GLaDOS played Minecraft.
02:12:18 GLaDOS from Portal 2.
02:12:19 Portal 1, in fact.
02:12:21 I think I understood the first like three words of that.
02:12:23 Did anyone...
02:12:24 I could not make it.
02:12:25 I literally could not make out a word of that.
02:12:27 Yeah, was that Miku?
02:12:28 Who was that?
02:12:30 It was Red Boy Genius.
02:12:32 All right, next voicemail.
02:12:34 I thought that you guys might be able to get meaning out of it
02:12:36 that I couldn't figure out.
02:12:37 Okay, all right.
02:12:38 Unfortunately, it didn't pan out that way.
02:12:40 But I also just thought it sounded nice.
02:12:41 It didn't pan pizza out that way.
02:12:42 Oh.
02:12:43 It did sound nice.
02:12:44 Okay, so there's the plus.
02:12:45 I did enjoy it aesthetically.
02:12:46 So I'll give it that.
02:12:47 Okay, let's move on.
02:12:48 Oh, you know what?
02:12:48 This one is actually directly for Mage
02:12:50 and since she's not here, I'm going to skip it.
02:12:52 So sorry, Ultra Violet.
02:12:54 Wait, why?
02:12:54 Oh, it's for Mage.
02:12:56 It was, you know what?
02:12:57 I mean, I could play it.
02:12:58 I could play it.
02:12:58 It's for Mage, but...
02:12:59 Well, maybe we could wait.
02:13:00 Well, see, yeah, I'll just play it.
02:13:01 She won't be here for like two weeks.
02:13:02 All right, fuck it. Here we go.
02:13:02 Play.
02:13:04 We can shit on her.
02:13:05 So, Mage, you claim to like Purple, yeah.
02:13:08 I think we're going to have to see if that's really true.
02:13:11 Now, you may have heard of this little wavelength
02:13:13 called Ultra Violet.
02:13:15 That's right.
02:13:16 Ultra Violet, also known as Purple II.
02:13:23 Now, normally Purple II isn't visible to the human eye,
02:13:26 but it turns out that that's actually
02:13:29 because your eyes are betraying you.
02:13:33 In fact, you can remove the lens from your eye,
02:13:38 and suddenly you will be able to see Purple II.
02:13:42 It's probably not safe for the eye.
02:13:46 You will still be able to see a new form of Purple.
02:13:50 So, tell me, Mage, is it worth it?
02:13:53 Is it will you destroy your eyes in the pursuit of Purple?
02:13:56 Is that true?
02:13:57 I like your answer.
02:13:58 Okay, I've never heard this thing about removing the lens,
02:14:01 but I have heard that there are some people
02:14:04 who's like eye cones are sensitive to a slightly wider range.
02:14:08 So, some people can see somewhat into the Ultra Violet spectrum,
02:14:13 and apparently, according to them,
02:14:15 it looks like the drum roll, please,
02:14:18 a slightly like white pale purplish color.
02:14:21 Sounds worth.
02:14:22 Sounds worth.
02:14:23 Yeah.
02:14:24 Cool.
02:14:26 I don't know about this lens removal thing.
02:14:30 Is it like the lens filters light in some particular way?
02:14:33 Maybe it blocks.
02:14:34 Maybe it.
02:14:35 I mean, it wouldn't be crazy because Ultra Violet light,
02:14:37 if it's harmful to your eye,
02:14:39 maybe your lens might have evolved to block some of it
02:14:42 to protect you from it.
02:14:43 That's true.
02:14:43 It doesn't.
02:14:44 Maybe.
02:14:45 I've never heard that before.
02:14:46 Wow, I don't care.
02:14:47 Let's listen to the next voicemail.
02:14:48 Yeah, great.
02:14:50 All right, all right.
02:14:51 Oh, you talk about don't care.
02:14:52 We got a call here from Oopsy Bobo.
02:14:55 Now, this man left a couple of messages.
02:14:59 I forget what the deal was.
02:15:00 I think this was for you, Munchy.
02:15:01 Let's see what he has to say.
02:15:02 Oh, I'm not going to like it then.
02:15:04 All right.
02:15:05 So my dumb ass fucked up,
02:15:07 and I wasn't sure if the message quality was great,
02:15:10 so I'm going to record this one again.
02:15:13 Munchy, fuck you.
02:15:14 This is a thread.
02:15:16 This is not a voicemail.
02:15:17 If you don't let my...
02:15:21 If you don't let my fucking message go in,
02:15:24 the one about the weed,
02:15:26 I'll get a fucking whore of minions,
02:15:28 and Oospamiu is smoking the weed message.
02:15:30 Just constantly, man.
02:15:31 There's just nothing you can do about it.
02:15:33 So, fuck you.
02:15:42 All right, so if I remember correctly,
02:15:44 this guy called in last week,
02:15:46 and I didn't put his message in
02:15:48 because it was really terrible,
02:15:49 and so now he's mad at me
02:15:51 for not putting in his message.
02:15:53 So I just want to give a shout out to Oopsy Bobo.
02:15:57 We're going to put this guy in the voice jail
02:16:00 because you had the audacity to appear on the show
02:16:02 and be a piece of shit,
02:16:05 and you are not funny,
02:16:06 and also you're from South America,
02:16:08 and you have not followed on the promise
02:16:10 that your forefathers gave you
02:16:11 with the glorious history that you have betrayed.
02:16:14 So good job, and you're going to the voice jail.
02:16:16 That's fair. His name is just Bobo,
02:16:18 and Oopsy was like the title,
02:16:19 but yeah, okay, Bobo, there you go, buddy.
02:16:21 This is exactly why we need the wall.
02:16:26 All right, we got our last message here.
02:16:27 The Panama wall.
02:16:28 That's the one.
02:16:29 Okay, game board, Gaylord, part three,
02:16:32 calling in.
02:16:33 This is our final one.
02:16:34 Okay, let's go immediately.
02:16:36 Captain Gaylord, if we don't see any results
02:16:38 of this foolish while you started,
02:16:39 who will prove the plow to you and your crew?
02:16:42 Don't worry, everyone, as they say.
02:16:44 This is definitely the day of the spades.
02:16:46 See your shit back.
02:16:47 What's the status of our latest missile?
02:16:49 Ah, Cap, this just came in.
02:16:51 I believe we hit him.
02:16:52 Yes, we did it.
02:16:53 We hit him.
02:16:54 Don't celebrate just that.
02:16:55 It might hit us back.
02:16:57 We moved.
02:16:57 We got that.
02:16:57 Bobo, gay, Bobo, Bobo.
02:17:02 Bye, Colleen.
02:17:03 They missed.
02:17:04 Yes.
02:17:05 Hooray.
02:17:05 Yes, we know.
02:17:07 We did it, boys.
02:17:08 We finally got the upper hand.
02:17:09 Lucky for us that we are celebrating
02:17:11 a royalty-free use.
02:17:14 We...
02:17:15 No, because the game board is so small,
02:17:17 we can't lose.
02:17:19 Actually, the game is played on a 25-tile grid,
02:17:22 with 11 of those tiles occupied by our fellowships.
02:17:26 The odds are hitting are probably so high,
02:17:28 so that if you would be playing in a, you know,
02:17:30 a weak paternal house, it is stupidly complicated.
02:17:34 Anyone with two grandtiles could have figured that one out.
02:17:37 We did this to ourselves.
02:17:38 Yeah, yeah.
02:17:38 Yeah, we have no one to blame ourselves.
02:17:40 I feel like I'm shooting a brand new story teller.
02:17:42 Do you?
02:17:43 Bobo.
02:17:44 What?
02:17:46 Oh, it's a hit.
02:17:47 I think.
02:17:48 He hit our Death's Reader.
02:17:49 Yeah, you know what?
02:17:50 You know what?
02:17:50 You hit all of our submarines.
02:17:52 Oh, they were all stacked on top of each other,
02:17:54 like at different depths.
02:17:55 And now we're dead.
02:17:56 Oh, no, you won.
02:17:57 So good.
02:17:58 I guess that's the end of the game.
02:17:59 Yep, that's right.
02:18:00 Hey, guys, if you try to be real of my ass, Batman 2,
02:18:04 I want to know that...
02:18:05 I want you guys to know that I personally hate you,
02:18:07 and a fucking please unironically kill yourself.
02:18:10 Like, with a news or a gun.
02:18:12 Anyway, humanly possible, end your own lives.
02:18:15 Oblivion?
02:18:16 Nobody can be riddle my ass, Batman 2.
02:18:17 Oh, this episode's not getting monetized.
02:18:19 That's for sure.
02:18:21 Oblivion, if you could try to make that audible in some way,
02:18:24 that would be great.
02:18:26 Apparently, Oblivion finds the original call audio
02:18:30 and puts that in instead of the SoundCloud version or something.
02:18:34 Oblivion does something.
02:18:35 It's the same fucking thing, but okay, if you can do that, great.
02:18:37 No, he told me that he does some shit with the voicemails
02:18:40 that just makes them better.
02:18:41 Okay, fantastic.
02:18:42 That man is a god and a king.
02:18:45 Okay, well, anyway, that's the last thing
02:18:46 we got to sit through on this fucking episode of the BCP.
02:18:49 You're free now.
02:18:50 You're free.
02:18:50 Wow.
02:18:51 We did it.
02:18:52 It was really great.
02:18:53 And then some like anarcho-communist shit came,
02:18:55 and then the voicemails took like 500 hours.
02:18:58 And you know what?
02:18:58 That's fine.
02:18:58 Only because we talked about it.
02:19:00 Specific questions for whatever.
02:19:02 Go read, bail, jpe, and pledge to the punk plushie Kickstarter.
02:19:08 And I just want to clarify, that's all true, do that.
02:19:10 And if you left a message and it didn't get on,
02:19:13 I want to confirm it's because it wasn't good enough
02:19:16 because I was looking for good things.
02:19:18 And there was a dirt.
02:19:19 I mean, you heard the quality of what we did end up accepting.
02:19:22 So you were even worse than this.
02:19:24 Oh, imagine that.
02:19:25 Imagine being in that position.
02:19:26 Okay, anyway, patrons.com slash the procrastiners people.
02:19:29 We just made a new fucking bonus episode.
02:19:31 It was Game of Thrones.
02:19:33 Me, Tom, and Gibb talked extensively
02:19:36 about everything you could possibly want to know.
02:19:37 Are you like mashing a burger, meat, or something?
02:19:40 Like you make it a patty over there?
02:19:41 I'm sorry.
02:19:42 Was that visible?
02:19:43 Sorry, okay.
02:19:44 So what I'm doing is I've got a bag of, a plastic bag of candy.
02:19:47 I know I'm trying to puncture it with like the sharp end of a pin
02:19:50 so I can get the candy out
02:19:51 so I can eat some delicious gummy drops.
02:19:55 Well, do that at your time.
02:19:58 All right.
02:19:58 But it sounded instead like you were crushing a burger
02:20:01 between your fingers.
02:20:02 At cpcrastinators on Twitter people.
02:20:04 Follow us there for links and whatnot.
02:20:06 And give us money, $5 bonus episodes, $1 patron lounge.
02:20:10 Have fun, hang out with us, be a cool guy.
02:20:12 There you go.
02:20:12 That's all you need to know.
02:20:13 All right.
02:20:14 That's it.
02:20:14 We're out of here.
02:20:14 We'll see you next week, people.
02:20:16 Check out, check out the new vapor.
02:20:17 It's up on stcomics.com right now.
02:20:19 Take all the goddamn links with us.
02:20:21 We all do a million things.
02:20:23 We're all cool guys with cool shit.
02:20:25 Correct.
02:20:26 The amount of the two will be done by now.
02:20:28 Go check out.
02:20:29 Oh my God.
02:20:29 That's that school.
02:20:30 We can't be so good.
02:20:31 All right.
02:20:32 I'll see you later, people.
02:20:32 Have a beautiful night.
02:20:34 Bye.
02:20:34 Bye.
02:20:35 Have a beautiful time.
02:20:35 Bye.
02:20:36 Bye.
02:20:36 Bye.
02:20:37 I love you.
02:20:38 Oh.
02:21:08 What the hell is wrong with me?
