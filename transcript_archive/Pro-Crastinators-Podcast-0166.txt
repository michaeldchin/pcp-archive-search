00:00:00 Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. Welcome, one and all, to the Republican first debate of the season, and boy,
00:00:10 can I not wait to tell you my thoughts on politics and whatnot. We've got a staunch member of the good old...
00:00:20 Is there a good old party? Isn't there a term for Republicans?
00:00:23 Yeah, the GOP.
00:00:25 Ben, front runner.
00:00:28 As your Republican president, I would burn each and every one of you for fuel.
00:00:37 A bold proposal, but an inevitable one. Hippocrit is here.
00:00:41 It's me a cow, moo. That's the symbol, right? That's the animal.
00:00:47 That's the kind of thing that I would crack down on as a Republican president. No more of this.
00:00:52 These cows running for public office has to be stopped now. We can't trust them, they're shifty. Tom Oliver?
00:00:58 I have no idea why we've been calling Souls games and their Elk Souls-like, because I just watched an interview of the guy who made Neo,
00:01:06 and apparently some headed Sony calls them Massacor, and I think that's the fucking best name ever we should use it.
00:01:13 I mean, Hippo has a name. Dark Demon Blood.
00:01:17 Yeah, Dark Demon Blood. Now with Sekiro, it'd be like Dark Demon Blood Shadow.
00:01:24 So it's clunky, but it's cool.
00:01:27 The point is that it's for all the games, even the ones outside of FromSoft.
00:01:31 Massacor sounds like it would also apply to something like Super Meat Boy, or I Want to Be the Guy.
00:01:39 True.
00:01:40 Maybe it does.
00:01:42 Or Dynasty Warriors.
00:01:43 I mean, is the implication here how hard it is?
00:01:46 I don't know. It was weird because it was just like an IGN video that I was just looking for footage, because I'm making a video on it right now.
00:01:52 Dude, Crash Bandicoot is so Massacor.
00:01:54 And they just translated it as talking about they had a bunch of influence from Bloodborne.
00:01:58 They're like, yeah, the guy from Sony who pioneered the Massacor genre and worked on Bloodborne.
00:02:02 I'm like, what the fuck? Where did this come from?
00:02:04 Just to be clear, that's a play on Massacist as opposed to Massacor.
00:02:09 Which is what I was first thinking.
00:02:11 It's a masochism and hardcore.
00:02:14 What's that one?
00:02:16 Hatred would definitely be a part of that new anime girl school shooter game.
00:02:22 That definitely counts.
00:02:23 Well, that's like a year old or something.
00:02:25 I gotta play those on an IGN.
00:02:27 I forget the name.
00:02:29 It's a JRP, what's the word?
00:02:32 Game maker, not game maker, RPG maker.
00:02:34 It was made in RPG maker and it's a school shooting game where you play as a girl.
00:02:39 It's like a choose your option game, I think, where you just like visual novel style.
00:02:43 You walk into the classroom, a turn based battle starts, you have one command shoot.
00:02:48 There are like 20 enemies on screen.
00:02:50 They're all named like student A, student B, student C.
00:02:53 You just go shoot, shoot, shoot.
00:02:55 You know, to be fair, I didn't look at much.
00:02:57 It's not like that.
00:02:58 But you know what game is like that?
00:02:59 Page one of the champion.
00:03:01 Now that I think about it.
00:03:02 That's a massacre game.
00:03:04 It's in a massacre core kind of sense.
00:03:08 Indeed, exactly.
00:03:09 Oh, by the way, also Munchie is here.
00:03:10 I was going to say you impotent whelp and then talk about how I was creating the Neo Progressive Bull Moose Party.
00:03:16 But the moment has passed and no one remembers the opening premise of the joke of this episode.
00:03:21 I'm going for you.
00:03:22 You know what?
00:03:23 Okay, thank you, Nate.
00:03:24 I appreciate it.
00:03:25 You're welcome.
00:03:26 You've got my endorsement and my subservience in all things.
00:03:30 I want to kick things off.
00:03:32 I want to kick things off with Steam versus the Epic Store.
00:03:37 People have been talking about like something about like some bullshit or some sort of bullshit go along.
00:03:42 I love Boogie.
00:03:43 Dude, I love Boogie so much.
00:03:45 Was Boogie talking about this?
00:03:46 What does he have to say about this episode?
00:03:48 Isn't Boogie, you know what?
00:03:49 I don't even know.
00:03:50 I don't remember if Boogie is a shill for the Epic Store or if he hates the Epic Store
00:03:55 and talks about how much he hates it.
00:03:57 Either way, fuck him.
00:03:58 I'm guessing the latter, but I don't know.
00:04:00 He's an idiot.
00:04:01 I haven't really looked into too much of like what people are angry about.
00:04:06 I just think that it is strange that people are angry at all because every argument I've seen is like,
00:04:14 well, that doesn't matter.
00:04:15 Like it doesn't matter that there's excuses on PC.
00:04:17 Well, here's just the first thing.
00:04:18 Because it's like you don't have to buy a console.
00:04:21 What is happening right now?
00:04:23 All right.
00:04:24 I'll set the ground layer.
00:04:25 Please.
00:04:26 Steam is a place where you buy games online on PC.
00:04:29 Whoa, wait, stop.
00:04:30 Hold on.
00:04:31 Wait, can you repeat that?
00:04:32 Steam.
00:04:33 Computer?
00:04:34 Yes.
00:04:35 What?
00:04:36 And then there's this game called Fortnite, which owned by Epic Games.
00:04:41 They made an Epic Store.
00:04:43 We're moving so fast.
00:04:45 And they also have a big PC gaming store where they're buying up deals with certain indie
00:04:54 games and larger games and whatever to have games exclusively on their store.
00:05:00 And there's a big like war going on, I guess.
00:05:05 And people are like championing Steam because it has like a shopping basket.
00:05:11 And that's it.
00:05:13 I don't really know what the people championing Steam really have going for them other than
00:05:19 there's many features in Steam, but Steam has also been...
00:05:22 Convenience, maybe?
00:05:23 That's the main thing, I would think.
00:05:24 It's annoying to have to get a second thing.
00:05:26 Well, it's not even that difficult.
00:05:29 The reason I have like so much like disdain for the fact that there's a war about it is
00:05:35 that you know that image of like the artist puts his cake on the table and he sees another
00:05:41 cake and he's like, oh, shit, that's a big cake.
00:05:43 That's a better cake than mine.
00:05:44 And then the viewer comes and he says, holy shit, two cakes and I'm the two cakes guy.
00:05:50 I see two stores, they're both good.
00:05:53 They're both fine.
00:05:54 They both have stuff on them.
00:05:55 They both have good deals and free shit.
00:05:57 And I'm like, hey, I can download these free apps, put them right next to each other on
00:06:01 my desktop.
00:06:02 I can easily see all the games.
00:06:04 I can just click.
00:06:05 I want them to compete to make the things better.
00:06:07 Like I don't see like any argument I've seen is like, that's not important.
00:06:13 What do I think of this?
00:06:14 What a good argument, but I can't as to why it's bad that there's two as opposed to one,
00:06:18 except that it's just mildly annoying to have two things.
00:06:21 What is the nature of this outrage?
00:06:23 I'm a little bit confused.
00:06:24 So like, you know, the ever store exists and then people got mad somehow in the ether.
00:06:29 I mean, what do you...
00:06:30 Well, here's like the basic gist, I think, is that the Epic Store is buying a lot of
00:06:36 exclusivity deals with certain games.
00:06:39 And that means people are having to download the Epic Client to play those games.
00:06:47 And that's the extent of like the problem with that.
00:06:51 I feel like I don't really see how it could be like a big problem unless you have like
00:06:56 a large steam wallet that you want to purchase things with.
00:06:59 There were some games that were promised on Steam that then...
00:07:02 There was at least one.
00:07:03 I forget what it was.
00:07:04 Shenmue 3 was the last big one.
00:07:07 That was supposed to be on Steam and then it was like people had bought it on Steam,
00:07:12 but then they just moved it to Epic.
00:07:14 They refunded everybody.
00:07:15 The first one that did that was a big one was Metro Exodus.
00:07:18 There were a bunch of pre-orders on Steam.
00:07:20 Okay, so if they refunded everybody, I mean, that is like...
00:07:23 Well, they didn't even refund them.
00:07:25 If everybody who pre-ordered is still going to be able to play it on Steam, it's just going forward.
00:07:28 You can only get it from the announcement point on Epic.
00:07:31 Oh, really?
00:07:32 It doesn't sound so bad then.
00:07:35 It's one thing when you bought it with the idea of it going on Steam, but the only thing
00:07:43 that gives you really is an addition to your Steam library list, Steam achievements and
00:07:51 Steam trading cards and a lot of Steam bullshit that I really have never cared about at all.
00:07:59 I don't know, Steam friends and curation.
00:08:02 Obviously, the Epic store is new and it doesn't have a lot of stuff in it.
00:08:07 But I play games, I buy them to play them.
00:08:10 I don't really go...
00:08:12 If you think about it as a metaphor for a store, I don't go to the Steam store to be on Steam.
00:08:19 I just go there to look at what's there, if there's something I want, I buy it and then I play it.
00:08:24 The entire community Steam stuff is completely uninteresting and I don't give a shit.
00:08:32 I totally agree.
00:08:33 I think having a lack of that is not an issue for me.
00:08:36 As a pure video game store thing, there's nothing to be upset about really.
00:08:42 I did a bunch of vlogs about this on IM Games last month or so when it started getting really hot.
00:08:49 My takeaway from it for me personally was this is the epitome of a first world problem.
00:08:54 To get bent out of shape, you have to move your mouse cursor over 5 pixels to click on a different launcher.
00:09:00 It's just not a big deal.
00:09:03 I understand that people are inconvenienced by the idea of like,
00:09:06 I am invested in the Steam ecosystem and now there are these games that I want to play that I can't play on Steam.
00:09:12 To be clear though, these are not permanent exclusivity.
00:09:18 It's a six month to one year exclusivity period and then there can go on Steam.
00:09:23 Video games don't matter after the first six months though.
00:09:26 In that case, you shouldn't even fucking buy the game in the first place if it's only good for six months.
00:09:31 Fuck that.
00:09:34 It's a bit more multi-layered because the reason that a lot of these developers are moving to Epic and taking the deal in the first place
00:09:40 is not only the cash advance they get for signing an exclusivity agreement,
00:09:44 but Epic gives you way more money.
00:09:47 As a developer, you get 88% as opposed to on Steam where you only get 70%.
00:09:52 So they take a much smaller cut and that's like their big drop.
00:09:55 I want that pressure to be on them.
00:09:58 As everyone knows, generally competition is a good thing.
00:10:01 What's bizarre is that Steam has done nothing in response to this.
00:10:06 They have not made a statement.
00:10:08 They've probably been working on it.
00:10:10 They've just sat on their asses and done nothing like they have done basically for the last five to ten years.
00:10:15 That's Gaben's MO in life in general.
00:10:19 Hey, here's a conceptual issue that I have with this concept.
00:10:24 It's not really a major complaint, but it's like the things remain unideal and this does nothing to improve the situation.
00:10:32 So UniqueNameSaurus made a couple of videos that I found reasonably interesting about piracy.
00:10:37 I don't know if I agree with every single thing he said in a while, but there was one point that he said that was pretty cool
00:10:44 that I agreed with or at least made sense to me.
00:10:47 He was talking about anime releases and exclusivity deals with various licensing companies.
00:10:54 So if you have exclusivity deals for any given show, like for example, Evangelion is finally out in the West,
00:11:01 and Netflix has it solely, I think, and it's kind of fucked up.
00:11:07 Oh my God, guys. Evangelion is on Netflix. I can finally watch it.
00:11:12 I could never watch Ava before, but now I can watch it because it's on fucking Netflix.
00:11:19 Do you guys know?
00:11:20 I don't think you could buy it. I don't think it was on print anywhere.
00:11:22 Do you guys know about Love for Terrorism and Evangelion?
00:11:25 Buying anime.
00:11:26 What?
00:11:27 What about it?
00:11:28 All right.
00:11:29 I hope it's real.
00:11:30 I was finishing a point, by the way.
00:11:32 Oh, sorry. Continue, continue.
00:11:33 Okay, all I was going to say was just taking Evangelion as an example.
00:11:39 It actually is still a monopoly that doesn't allow for any of the kind of competitive forces that we would want to improve the product
00:11:47 if you have these exclusivity deals, because there simply is no ability to compete.
00:11:52 And what you would want, theoretically, is every service can produce the show
00:11:57 and they can each try to make it as presented as best as possible.
00:12:01 The perfect world is one where the best service is the one that people go to.
00:12:09 And then if everybody could have Ava, if Amazon had Ava and Netflix had Ava, it's just two.
00:12:19 It's not perfect, but it's more than...
00:12:21 I mean, for example...
00:12:22 If Amazon had Fly Me to the Moon in their version, then people would be like,
00:12:26 oh, I'm going to that one.
00:12:27 And there's a new dub they used.
00:12:29 Maybe the other service might use the old dub.
00:12:31 And then we could see, oh, this did much better.
00:12:33 That shows us that the people liked X more than Y, whichever one does better in that situation.
00:12:37 Yeah, that's the sort of thing that you would want, this kind of proliferation
00:12:41 among different platforms to solve.
00:12:43 But we have in no way done anything to fix that issue.
00:12:47 And I don't have a solution.
00:12:49 But that would be the main thing I would want something like this to solve,
00:12:52 but it does not, at least the way it's operating currently.
00:12:55 But then again, with Tom's point about it being a time exclusive,
00:12:58 maybe that will eventually help.
00:13:00 I mean, all you can really do as a creative is to be obstinate
00:13:04 and not let people do stupid things,
00:13:07 even if it means you're not going to get as much money
00:13:09 like the guy who made Calvin and Hobbes.
00:13:12 No adaptations ever, please, ever.
00:13:16 And that's why Calvin and Hobbes has not been ruined.
00:13:19 Okay, that's a cool idea.
00:13:21 But now that he's dead, which I assume he is,
00:13:24 let's work with his estate and get a Garfield crossover
00:13:28 with Calvin and Hobbes movie on the big screen.
00:13:31 As a massive fan of Calvin and Hobbes, that idea repulses me.
00:13:35 I mean, who's to say Hobbes is not Garfield?
00:13:38 Exactly.
00:13:39 The people eat it up.
00:13:40 Lasagna and whatever Calvin and Hobbes were into.
00:13:43 They're kind of fit.
00:13:44 Y'all breakers?
00:13:45 Sledding.
00:13:46 Lasagna on the sled.
00:13:47 That's the name of the show.
00:13:48 Oh, on a lasagna pan.
00:13:49 He could sled in a lasagna pan.
00:13:51 It's perfect.
00:13:53 Excellent.
00:13:54 I already want to end this podcast.
00:13:55 This is horrifying.
00:13:58 Anyway.
00:13:59 Before we pivot away.
00:14:01 The interesting thing about a perfect ideal world,
00:14:05 like a perfect ideal service, Gogg, the underdog hero,
00:14:09 the greatest service of all time, no DRM.
00:14:12 They have stepped up to the plate and they're like,
00:14:14 hey guys, we're going to make a new application for Gogg Galaxy,
00:14:19 which is like their version of Steam.
00:14:21 But they're completely revamping it.
00:14:23 And what it's going to do is it's going to tie into Steam and Epic.
00:14:28 So you launch Gogg and you have access to your Steam, your Epic,
00:14:32 and you're gone.
00:14:33 Now we're talking in one place.
00:14:34 Yes.
00:14:35 I really love that.
00:14:36 That's the good shit.
00:14:37 Because those guys have always seemed to be like, yeah,
00:14:40 we just want this to be good.
00:14:43 Like the reason they started was all these old games
00:14:46 that they wanted to play, they just couldn't play.
00:14:48 It's really difficult to get a fucking working version
00:14:51 of populist at the beginning or whatever.
00:14:53 Yeah.
00:14:54 Right.
00:14:55 They loved that game.
00:14:56 And it was like, oh my god, Gogg, they care.
00:14:58 They care about this sort of thing.
00:15:00 They care about making the games accessible and easy to use.
00:15:06 And I'm sure they're big into archiving.
00:15:09 It's just a nicer feeling than Epic.
00:15:13 And those guys are owned by...
00:15:15 There's the CG project read, guys, right?
00:15:18 The Witcher.
00:15:19 Yeah.
00:15:20 Okay, that's great.
00:15:21 That's great.
00:15:22 That's great.
00:15:23 That's great.
00:15:24 That's great.
00:15:25 That's great.
00:15:26 That's great.
00:15:27 That's great.
00:15:28 That's great.
00:15:29 That's great.
00:15:30 That's great.
00:15:31 That's great.
00:15:32 That's great.
00:15:33 That's great.
00:15:34 That's great.
00:15:35 That's great.
00:15:36 That's great.
00:15:37 That's great.
00:15:38 That's great.
00:15:39 That's great.
00:15:40 That's great.
00:15:41 That's great.
00:15:42 That's great.
00:15:43 That's great.
00:15:44 That's great.
00:15:45 That's great.
00:15:46 That's great.
00:15:47 That's great.
00:15:48 That's great.
00:15:49 That's great.
00:15:50 Oh, it's great for destruction.
00:15:51 It's just auego.
00:15:52 That's great!
00:15:53 That's great.
00:15:54 That's great.
00:15:55 That's great.
00:15:56 That's great.
00:15:57 That's great.
00:15:58 Great.
00:15:59 Fantastic.
00:16:00 All right, good lip shake.
00:16:01 That's good.
00:16:02 That's great.
00:16:03 I actually...
00:16:04 I actually heard Marc in here, you and I.
00:16:06 Marc taught me how to do doorstrokes in�루.
00:16:08 And I think I also did really cool.
00:16:09 And you never did one in the future though.
00:16:10 Any ideas in there?
00:16:11 No.
00:16:12 No.
00:16:13 No, with regards to the WCS, why did you...
00:16:14 You mentioned the Witcher, didn't you?
00:16:15 It was his Demon Souls playthrough,
00:16:17 there's a wall in Shrine of Storms that you can jump over,
00:16:19 and it was not intended to be there by the developer.
00:16:23 And, but people use it to skip like two thirds
00:16:25 of the entire route, which if you play Demon Souls,
00:16:28 it's like a huge thing, you should not be able to do it,
00:16:30 but you can with this exploit.
00:16:32 And Miyazaki, you know, creator or whatever,
00:16:34 Dark Souls Man was asked like,
00:16:35 hey, in an interview that Matthew highlighted,
00:16:38 it's like, if you were making the game, like originally,
00:16:40 would you have kept that there,
00:16:41 or would you have like removed it?
00:16:42 He's like, if I was back in time making it then,
00:16:44 I would have removed it,
00:16:46 but I would never remove it now,
00:16:48 because it's a part of like the ecosystem,
00:16:50 and it's part of the identity of the game,
00:16:52 which is this whole thing I always talk about,
00:16:53 how art is created and then shown,
00:16:55 and so you need to preserve that vision,
00:16:57 and I am so terrified of our modern day
00:16:59 of like patching things,
00:17:00 and removing little things like that,
00:17:02 that add personality and color to games.
00:17:04 Oh, I feel so much as being lost in time,
00:17:06 and it's very sad.
00:17:07 Kind of like the whole World of Warcraft vanilla thing,
00:17:09 how that just got patched,
00:17:11 and they brought back vanilla recently.
00:17:12 Oh, is that recent?
00:17:13 Is it out now?
00:17:15 Yeah, I think it's out now, pretty sure.
00:17:16 I don't think it comes out until like August.
00:17:20 There's like a closed beta that people are playing.
00:17:22 Soon, yeah.
00:17:23 This is responding to those people's concerns,
00:17:25 and frankly, I kind of feel bad for,
00:17:27 maybe there's like a couple people out there
00:17:29 who loved like vanilla plus like one patch.
00:17:32 They thought like that was the best version of the game,
00:17:35 but like where's their, you know, non-vanilla,
00:17:37 vanilla plus one version.
00:17:39 I mean, it's a sad feeling knowing that
00:17:41 I will never be able to play what I perceive
00:17:44 to be the best era of Team Fortress 2 again.
00:17:47 Like I have this game in my Steam library
00:17:51 called Team Fortress 2,
00:17:52 and it functions much the same way
00:17:55 that the game that I used to play does,
00:17:57 but with such minor tweaks that just here and there
00:18:01 over and over and over again,
00:18:03 that make it feel weirdly alien to me,
00:18:06 even though on the face of it,
00:18:08 almost all of it is the same.
00:18:10 And you know, the thing about these games,
00:18:12 the thing about these games is I'm aware
00:18:14 that like this is a trade-off,
00:18:16 we're sacrificing like preserving history, I guess,
00:18:19 for like the ability to upgrade games,
00:18:21 which is a fantastic ability, it's true,
00:18:24 but you know, all I'm lamenting
00:18:26 is the thing that's being lost there.
00:18:28 This is kind of why I don't want physical copies
00:18:30 of games to go away, because I mean,
00:18:33 with a physical disc, like the 1.0 is burned to the disc.
00:18:38 So you disconnect from the internet.
00:18:39 And I buy digital, but I should buy physical
00:18:42 for that exact reason.
00:18:43 But then again, it's annoying though,
00:18:45 because sometimes you put like,
00:18:47 if it's a PS3 or PS4 game,
00:18:50 I mean, I guess you can turn the internet off,
00:18:52 but if you put a disc in, it'll say,
00:18:53 ah, this is the version 1.0 version of the game.
00:18:55 It'll require you to upgrade before you can play.
00:18:57 You have to update before, yeah,
00:18:58 and it'll just patch all this new stuff onto it.
00:19:01 That's just, that's a symptom of this larger,
00:19:03 like they're just like, everyone's online,
00:19:04 you have to be able to upgrade now.
00:19:05 But just having the disc gives you the option
00:19:07 of going back to the 1.0 if you want to.
00:19:09 Whereas the digital, they're kind of fucked.
00:19:12 Something to mention about the World of Warcraft thing though,
00:19:14 as much as I want to give Blizzard Activision credit
00:19:18 for listening to people.
00:19:19 Never forget that Jon Tron video
00:19:21 where they shut those boys down.
00:19:23 They did famously go on stage,
00:19:25 tell everybody you don't want this at all,
00:19:27 and then people, I forgot about that.
00:19:30 When people made fan versions of these vanilla servers,
00:19:34 they litigated and shut them down,
00:19:35 only to turn around and monetize exactly
00:19:37 what the fans were doing for free anyways.
00:19:40 I mean, oh, they have the right to do that legally.
00:19:43 I get the business incentive, but-
00:19:45 You're still a bit of a cut.
00:19:46 It makes them, they're very much,
00:19:48 like the guys running World of Warcraft,
00:19:50 they weren't the original guys who made it.
00:19:52 They're sort of like, the story writers
00:19:55 have been like kind of stupid over time.
00:19:58 There's like, they clearly don't have the same reverence
00:20:03 for the original game as the people who play it, the game.
00:20:07 They just sort of like up their own arse.
00:20:08 I mean, a few of them, I forget the names.
00:20:09 Even people who make a game, even the original,
00:20:11 like they have a very different experience
00:20:13 of like the people who first played it.
00:20:15 Like this Demon's Souls example.
00:20:16 Man, I just, it annoys me on such a,
00:20:19 this actually ties into just like the FF7 remake thing.
00:20:22 People just look at the, they think they understand
00:20:26 that like, they look at a vanilla WoW versus like new WoW,
00:20:29 and they're like, what's the difference?
00:20:30 They look the same to me,
00:20:32 because they weren't there, man.
00:20:33 They weren't in the trenches.
00:20:34 They didn't experience what it was like
00:20:36 to be part of that community.
00:20:37 And I would never speak to like what the vanilla WoW community
00:20:40 was like compared to like the new people,
00:20:42 because I don't fucking know.
00:20:43 But I do know about some things, like like FF7.
00:20:46 And to people who just say like, shut up.
00:20:48 It's like, it's then, you know, it's...
00:20:50 Shut up, just to consume product
00:20:52 and then be excited for the next product.
00:20:54 At least when people make the argument that like,
00:20:57 it's an upgrade, well, not even,
00:20:58 I won't use the word upgrade because that implies positivity.
00:21:01 People will say like, it's a reimagining.
00:21:04 It's a new version for new players.
00:21:06 I mean, at least that's like an honest argument
00:21:09 you can make that like, okay, sure.
00:21:11 So we're admitting that it's totally changing tons of shit.
00:21:14 And that's, you know, I need to just deal with that
00:21:16 or not play it.
00:21:17 At least in the case though of FF7,
00:21:20 like it's not an online always connected game.
00:21:23 So you can always go back and play, you know,
00:21:25 the PS1 version.
00:21:26 Thank God for that.
00:21:27 Thank God for that.
00:21:28 Imagine if this was like, oh, FF7 was always connected online
00:21:31 and now it's just become this, you know?
00:21:34 Games are gonna be like that more and more.
00:21:35 Yeah, I mean, Stadia is, if that becomes successful,
00:21:39 we're all fucked.
00:21:40 Again, this comes down to artists being obstinate
00:21:44 and refusing to bow down to sing the things like this.
00:21:47 If I ever make a game, I mean, you know, whatever,
00:21:49 if I ever make a game and I want it to stay how it is,
00:21:52 I will definitely always have the original version
00:21:55 like accessible.
00:21:57 Like if I have a website like download patch 1.0,
00:21:59 I mean, Minecraft does that and that's great for Minecraft.
00:22:02 You can download these original alpha.
00:22:04 Minecraft's surprisingly incredible about it.
00:22:05 For such like a big company like Microsoft,
00:22:07 they are surprisingly excellent about it.
00:22:09 They probably just kept that ethos.
00:22:10 I mean, I don't know for sure,
00:22:12 but like based on the way that Notch made it originally,
00:22:14 he seemed like a kind of guy who cared
00:22:16 about that sort of thing.
00:22:17 They probably kept that in place.
00:22:18 Maybe he like had something in the contract
00:22:20 when he sold Mojang.
00:22:21 He's like, no, you gotta keep this shit up.
00:22:24 Yeah.
00:22:24 I mean, the thing is, guys, to everybody out there,
00:22:28 ex-former professional programmer
00:22:31 work with a ton of,
00:22:33 it is so common for people to preserve old versions
00:22:37 of software because they know that when you're doing
00:22:40 professional, I don't know, engineering work or whatever,
00:22:42 you've got old software, you need to be able to support.
00:22:45 And after a while, it's true.
00:22:46 Things can get phased out and not supported
00:22:48 by newer releases.
00:22:50 We have all this engineering software, we did,
00:22:53 that would connect with each other
00:22:54 and you have to make sure that your versions are compatible
00:22:56 and that was always a headache.
00:22:57 But you can always go back and get like,
00:22:59 the old, old versions of things, they still exist.
00:23:02 And all I'm advocating for is that we preserve that
00:23:05 for games as well, if possible.
00:23:08 That'd be, it wouldn't even be hard, frankly.
00:23:10 You just have to have the code,
00:23:12 have the fucking data available to people to download.
00:23:14 People are smart, we can figure it out.
00:23:16 The problem is these companies don't see games
00:23:20 as art to be preserved, it's just business.
00:23:23 And so they don't care.
00:23:24 Why preserve this thing when we can just turn around
00:23:26 and resell it to you in 10 years all over again.
00:23:28 It kind of reminds me of like,
00:23:29 it's a little bit like how Apple feels
00:23:31 such a need to control all their patents
00:23:33 and data and versions of everything.
00:23:35 And like, I understand that from a business side,
00:23:37 but the cost is like people's ability to, I don't know,
00:23:40 like it's a black box.
00:23:41 You can't get in there and see what's being changed
00:23:44 and I don't know, make tweaks or something.
00:23:46 Maybe people can, I'm no expert on Apple products
00:23:48 or services, but this is my understanding, yeah.
00:23:51 Nothing's built to last anymore.
00:23:54 Yeah, I don't know.
00:23:55 Planned obsolescence.
00:23:56 Planned obsolescence.
00:23:58 Planned obsolescence.
00:24:00 Planned obsolescence.
00:24:01 Put that on a shirt.
00:24:03 Speaking of planned obsolescence,
00:24:04 all I was gonna say was I was listening to H3H3's interview
00:24:08 with Vsauce briefly the other day.
00:24:11 And speaking of planned obsolescence,
00:24:13 he, as basically a futurist himself,
00:24:16 I was encouraged to see that he agrees with me
00:24:19 that immortality for human beings
00:24:22 is probably not a good idea
00:24:24 from like a growth of the species perspective.
00:24:27 Not because I want people to die,
00:24:28 that is unfortunate and a moral bad thing that happens,
00:24:31 but it is a pragmatic step
00:24:33 to make sure that ideas are continually evolving
00:24:37 and to not go krypton,
00:24:39 because that's what happened in Superman.
00:24:40 That's why krypton went to shit,
00:24:42 because everybody lived forever
00:24:43 and their society was stagnant and shit.
00:24:45 But just saying that, that was pretty cool.
00:24:48 I'd never watched Vsauce, but after that,
00:24:49 I was like, I could get into this man.
00:24:52 If you're like Michael,
00:24:54 but you don't like Vsauce,
00:24:58 you should check out Ding, formerly Dong,
00:25:02 which is a YouTube channel where he just shows off
00:25:06 weird maths toys and is really funny,
00:25:09 because he's a creepy crazy man.
00:25:11 I love him, he's great.
00:25:12 He is creepy and I love the,
00:25:14 when he talks weird in Vsauce,
00:25:16 it's kind of like off-putting,
00:25:17 because it feels so, I don't know,
00:25:20 but what I want him to be is my weird uncle
00:25:23 who talks funny and do his weird eyebrow raises.
00:25:26 He really plays into that on Ding,
00:25:30 like being the creepy uncle, like crazy man,
00:25:33 excited about stupid maths shit.
00:25:36 Oh, I love him.
00:25:37 He did a video in April and he said,
00:25:39 well Christmas is nearly around the corner
00:25:41 and I thought it would be a great time
00:25:43 to talk about this thing
00:25:45 that has nothing to do with Christmas.
00:25:46 He just made it a Christmas episode for no reason.
00:25:48 Oh, see, it's funny, it's good.
00:25:50 I like it a lot.
00:25:51 He really won me over with this one clip
00:25:53 on the H3 podcast, way to go Vsauce.
00:25:56 Is there a guy named like Vsauce3?
00:25:58 Are there like multiple versions of this manner?
00:26:01 Vsauce Michael is the only good one.
00:26:03 Vsauce, Jake, and Vsauce, and Vsauce, Paul.
00:26:10 I don't remember their names, or Kevin or something.
00:26:13 Are you say they shit munchie?
00:26:15 They're shit.
00:26:16 I say they're shit.
00:26:17 Good to know.
00:26:18 Yeah, I believe you.
00:26:19 Vsauce3 is Jake and he went on,
00:26:23 he went full jauntron and making like a big set.
00:26:26 Uh-oh, racially.
00:26:28 No, no, he had like this video,
00:26:30 which was basically a very basic Vsauce video
00:26:33 about like some very understandable stuff.
00:26:37 But he like obviously spent like thousands of dollars
00:26:40 on a set and costumes and things.
00:26:42 And it didn't get a lot of views and he got depressed
00:26:45 and he was like, man, you just didn't need
00:26:47 to do all of that stuff.
00:26:48 You weren't talking about anything very interesting.
00:26:51 I don't know what's going on with him.
00:26:53 The last I saw, he was like working
00:26:55 with Casey Neistat on something.
00:26:57 But that was a while ago.
00:26:58 They're gonna say working to KFC.
00:26:59 I don't know.
00:27:00 Maybe that too.
00:27:03 Gotta pay back, bro.
00:27:04 You're working with Casey Neistat,
00:27:04 things are going pretty well.
00:27:06 Yeah, yeah.
00:27:07 One content creator I quite cherish,
00:27:10 which I feel is almost awkward and embarrassing
00:27:13 to admit because he's popular,
00:27:16 and therefore the subject of must-needed ire,
00:27:21 I listen to and I follow CGP Grey a lot.
00:27:24 And so I hear him talk about rubbing shoulders
00:27:27 with all these sorts of people about Vsauce
00:27:29 and all the different versions and clones of Vsauce
00:27:33 going to VidCon and about how he knows
00:27:36 and interacts with these people.
00:27:37 And it's interesting to hear it from the horse's math
00:27:41 because I don't really interact with any YouTubers
00:27:45 that we consider popular outside of him.
00:27:48 So, and because he's a reclusive guy himself,
00:27:52 it's sort of like two layers of filteredness
00:27:55 that I'm just hearing about these dimmy gods on earth
00:27:58 who couldn't bend people to their will instantaneously
00:28:01 if they requested it.
00:28:02 Do you ever see that Bill Wertz clip?
00:28:05 You know, I just did a bad thing.
00:28:07 Everybody knows Bill Wertz.
00:28:09 Of course.
00:28:10 When he was, he accepted like a webby or whatever it was.
00:28:12 Yes, yes, yes.
00:28:13 It just seems so like not,
00:28:15 no, a little bit judge anybody
00:28:17 even goes to these.
00:28:18 I mean, I would go to if I was him,
00:28:20 but he just, man, he's one of us, dude.
00:28:22 He didn't give a fuck about this award.
00:28:25 Or he was like, thanks.
00:28:26 And then he peaced out.
00:28:27 I mean, I've always like loved the idea
00:28:29 of like not doing that exact thing.
00:28:32 Yeah, yeah.
00:28:33 Like just saying things.
00:28:34 Reminds me of you a little bit.
00:28:34 Musician, freak of nature.
00:28:37 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:28:37 Disturbing to look upon, yeah.
00:28:39 I can sink into what happened.
00:28:40 Give goes up, wins his webby.
00:28:42 Just goes up there in his I'm just being cool T-shirt.
00:28:46 Yes, of course.
00:28:47 It's a little nod, a little.
00:28:48 And then just goes away.
00:28:49 It proceeds to dab on all the haters at once.
00:28:52 That's the way.
00:28:53 I know when the last straw gets 27 million views
00:28:57 and they'll be the true bill where it's desperate.
00:29:00 Imagine the first like dab at the Oscars.
00:29:03 I bet it's probably already happened, yeah.
00:29:05 Years ago, yeah, yeah.
00:29:08 God, I hope it's me again.
00:29:12 Hey, you know, speaking of AGD-DGUQ,
00:29:15 the thisfastgamer.com,
00:29:20 I have like trouble watching,
00:29:23 well, I don't have trouble watching speedruns,
00:29:26 but like I always like to watch a speedrun
00:29:29 like of games that I played as a young'un.
00:29:33 Because obviously when you're a young'un, you're stupid
00:29:35 and you don't play games really fast.
00:29:37 But then it turns out that all the games
00:29:41 like PS2 games of that era,
00:29:44 you can't really play them fast
00:29:46 and a lot of things you can't skip.
00:29:47 It's like I look up speedrun of like Sly Cooper 2.
00:29:53 World record like five hours long.
00:29:55 Like that's not fun.
00:29:56 Same with like, yeah, like FF7 or Kingdom Hearts 2.
00:29:59 They're like eight hours long or something.
00:30:00 It's like I'm not sitting down.
00:30:01 I mean, all my childhood favorites
00:30:03 are pretty good speedrun stuff.
00:30:04 It's mostly like SNES stuff.
00:30:06 So that's like the golden era.
00:30:10 I was watching the Secret of Mana speedrun the other day.
00:30:12 I've been replaying it with the new collection on Switch.
00:30:14 It's pretty cool.
00:30:15 I'll play the sequel, Legend of Mana,
00:30:18 whatever it's retitled or something.
00:30:20 And like specifically watching them do things.
00:30:23 First of all, when you're young and you play a game,
00:30:25 you're probably just gonna miss a lot
00:30:26 of like mainline content.
00:30:27 I know I did.
00:30:29 Watching like Mario RPG or Secret of Mana,
00:30:31 it's like, oh my God, there's all these things
00:30:32 I didn't know about.
00:30:33 That's pretty dope.
00:30:34 And then also just watching them
00:30:35 just break the game wide open with like these,
00:30:38 especially if it's like not glitchless,
00:30:40 but like if they don't hack the game,
00:30:42 they just use whatever mechanics are available to them.
00:30:45 It's like, wow, so cool.
00:30:47 I wanna do that too someday.
00:30:49 I could be a strong boy.
00:30:51 And I could now probably beat Secret of Mana
00:30:53 in a couple hours shorter than intended
00:30:56 with a couple of these tricks I've learned.
00:30:58 Watching games where they make heavy use of glitches,
00:31:02 like Nintendo 64 games,
00:31:04 it's always like makes me feel like weirdly
00:31:07 how could you make a game this poorly?
00:31:11 Even though I know that these are like professionals
00:31:13 who have spent their entire lives
00:31:14 to break these beloved games.
00:31:16 They were helped to get on.
00:31:17 Which for a lot of the intense purposes
00:31:18 is functioning completely fine.
00:31:20 Do you ever watch the Summoning Salt like History of?
00:31:23 I love those, yeah.
00:31:25 Yeah, like the parts where like,
00:31:27 he'll explain the mechanic,
00:31:29 like how like everyone was looking for a long time
00:31:33 for a way to skip the bridge to Ganon's Castle
00:31:36 in Ocarina of Time.
00:31:38 And then like an incredibly esoteric fucking method
00:31:43 was discovered and it just changed the whole game, yeah.
00:31:48 Or the way when it was finally discovered
00:31:51 how you could beat Mario 64
00:31:52 without collecting any stars, but the last one.
00:31:55 Yeah, that was great.
00:31:56 Speedrunners are like the modern day equivalent
00:31:58 of our ancient ancestors.
00:31:59 Like the ones that first discovered
00:32:00 that you can plant seeds and then reap the wheat.
00:32:04 No, fucking dumb.
00:32:06 No, because it's like how would you possibly think
00:32:10 to eat a berry or to like consume anything?
00:32:13 Like when you come into existence.
00:32:14 Because it's bright and colorful and you're like,
00:32:15 we've got instincts, you know, we're based on.
00:32:17 No, listen, impossible.
00:32:19 And that's what speedruns like, you know,
00:32:21 you just backflip into the same wall
00:32:24 over and over and over again on the 50th one,
00:32:26 you now clip into the last level
00:32:28 and instantly gain the star.
00:32:29 That's what agriculture is like, you know.
00:32:31 You're a human out in society and then you just backflip
00:32:34 into the ground over and over and over again
00:32:36 and assume enough, your family is fed
00:32:37 and you're the king of a primitive society.
00:32:41 I mean, it's not like people just go into a game,
00:32:44 like speedrunners or like hackmasters go into a game
00:32:47 and just like jump into shit.
00:32:50 I mean, some obviously do just for fun.
00:32:52 They find things, but like, you know,
00:32:55 Pan and Koic, the famous man, watch for rolling rocks
00:33:02 in 0.58 presses.
00:33:04 Half a time it doesn't work that way.
00:33:06 Yes.
00:33:07 Yeah, like I watch all of his videos,
00:33:10 even the ones that are like really mathematical
00:33:12 and like, you know, when he's just explaining
00:33:15 how walls, floors and ceilings work
00:33:17 and how they push Mario like every frame.
00:33:19 I still love that blue coins video.
00:33:21 Yeah, and like all of these things
00:33:24 and they use like a system of like recording the game
00:33:29 through and a specific emulating thing
00:33:32 so that they can look at the code that's running
00:33:34 and see the numbers at like in real time.
00:33:37 And so they can see like visually
00:33:41 without really having to jump into every wall,
00:33:43 what walls could be jumped through
00:33:45 if you had enough speed.
00:33:46 And the question is how to get enough speed
00:33:49 or something.
00:33:50 And then they find a way.
00:33:51 Yeah.
00:33:52 They break that shit.
00:33:53 So you can hack into the mainframe to find secrets.
00:33:56 Every cell often when I'm walking down the street
00:33:59 and this is real, Kaz can attest to this.
00:34:02 Sometimes I've just like gone to a wall.
00:34:03 That kid who no-clipped all the way to school.
00:34:05 I mean, I've like pretended to no-clip through walls
00:34:10 on many occasions.
00:34:11 Where I'll just go up to wall trying back to it
00:34:13 and just go hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop.
00:34:15 I feel like, stop, stop.
00:34:18 I think I've seen you do that.
00:34:19 Hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop.
00:34:22 That kid whose dad worked at Nintendo
00:34:24 and had all the hacks.
00:34:25 Do you do like the backwards long jump?
00:34:27 Like, yahoo.
00:34:28 No, yahoo, yahoo, yahoo, exactly.
00:34:30 Yahoo, yahoo, yahoo, yahoo, yahoo, yahoo.
00:34:31 That kid who, what is it?
00:34:33 Back jumped up the stairs at light speed
00:34:35 and got past the infinite staircase.
00:34:37 AKA the escalator going down.
00:34:39 Yeah, that's good.
00:34:42 Actually there is that one clip of a dude doing that
00:34:44 that's like famously posted or whatever.
00:34:46 For real, oh my gosh.
00:34:47 Well, okay, kind of, it's like.
00:34:50 Okay, I don't know if this is like
00:34:51 reverse footage. I don't know if it's possible.
00:34:52 It's like a dude, he does like a pose
00:34:55 at the bottom of a staircase.
00:34:57 And then like, he like moves backward
00:34:59 and his feet are moving in like a seemingly impossible way.
00:35:03 And he's like going backwards up the staircase.
00:35:05 And there's like a webm that's called like, you know,
00:35:07 MarioStairGlitch.mp4.mpg.webm, or whatever it is.
00:35:12 .mpreg, .normalpreg.
00:35:15 My favorite encoder.
00:35:16 .ntr, yahoo, it's all good.
00:35:19 Hey, well I have a slight tangent,
00:35:22 but this is actually all very much in keeping
00:35:24 with the subject that I wish to discuss today
00:35:26 on this episode, which was the concept
00:35:29 of spiritual successors, which kind of ties
00:35:33 into like preserving history and a little bit
00:35:36 and all that, because I just beat bloodstained
00:35:39 Ritual of the Night for my Nintendo Switch.
00:35:41 Hell yeah. Oh, you played on the Switch?
00:35:42 I've been hearing bad things about that version.
00:35:44 It is not good on the Switch.
00:35:47 There have been, okay, I've had one fatal glitch
00:35:51 where it just died and I had to restart the game
00:35:54 and lost progress, so that's not good that that happened.
00:35:57 I guess you backflip and you won too many walls, huh?
00:36:00 That's exactly, I went too many QPUs over
00:36:02 and just lost track of who I was spiritually.
00:36:07 I have no basis for comparison.
00:36:09 I don't know if it looks better on the PlayStation
00:36:11 or on PC or anything.
00:36:12 I gotta tell this game looks like ass.
00:36:14 I gotta watch those digital foundry videos, dude.
00:36:16 I should check those out, because I'm actually curious,
00:36:18 because I got a man in this game looked horrible
00:36:20 in my humble opinion, specifically the color design,
00:36:24 I thought was quite bad and the models
00:36:26 were not very impressive, and all the animations were,
00:36:30 they were fine and all that.
00:36:32 Because it wasn't sprites, it's 3D models
00:36:34 in a 2.5D perspective or whatever.
00:36:38 Just quite unattractive.
00:36:40 All the enemies look bad.
00:36:42 I miss the sprites intensely.
00:36:43 Sprites are infinitely better compared to this.
00:36:46 We're still in this awkward, transitionary phase.
00:36:48 I get why they did in 3D, but not great.
00:36:51 There was a bunch of ego posts of video
00:36:53 like a month ago or whatever about like,
00:36:54 we improved the visuals to me.
00:36:55 Yeah, I saw that.
00:36:57 That was okay. It didn't look very impressive.
00:36:59 I'm not, I've not been following this game very closely
00:37:04 whatsoever, I knew of its existence,
00:37:06 and I knew that people didn't like the way that it looked.
00:37:08 I had never seen it before.
00:37:10 And then I watched that video of him rather like,
00:37:15 pompously saying like, oh, listen,
00:37:18 you haven't seen my true form.
00:37:21 Listen, we've listened to criticism.
00:37:23 And here it is.
00:37:24 We've unveiled the new graphics.
00:37:27 And to me, they looked as bad as what I was imagining
00:37:30 that people were like.
00:37:31 It looked like people were saying.
00:37:34 It looked terrible.
00:37:35 To me, it looked like they applied filters
00:37:37 and maybe updated some of the textures.
00:37:40 I mean, probably a lot of them.
00:37:42 But the models were the same,
00:37:43 the animations were all the same.
00:37:44 And both of those I don't really care about.
00:37:46 The models were pretty ugly and clunky.
00:37:47 Okay, none of this is to my main point
00:37:50 because while there were many graphical glitches,
00:37:52 there were many kind of gameplay glitches,
00:37:54 like items that get stuck in walls,
00:37:55 and sometimes it was kind of weird when enemies dropped them.
00:37:57 And again, I had one game breaking glitch
00:37:59 where it stopped I to restart the game.
00:38:02 The thing is though, I loved the game
00:38:04 because I really don't give much of a fuck about,
00:38:07 like it reminded me of that Samus Returns remake
00:38:10 for the 3DS or whatever.
00:38:12 There was a 3DS game about on par
00:38:14 with this fucking Switch game in my estimation.
00:38:17 And you know, this is made by Kickstarter.
00:38:19 I haven't gone over the numbers to judge like,
00:38:22 okay, was my experience good enough
00:38:24 to justify the amount of money they make?
00:38:25 Like have they given their backers rewards?
00:38:28 And those are all valid concerns,
00:38:29 which I'm not even dismissing.
00:38:30 My point simply is that I have been a huge
00:38:35 Castlevania specifically Egavania fan
00:38:38 for a million years, ever since I played Castlevania,
00:38:41 fucking Circle of the Moon on GBA way back in the day.
00:38:44 I loved him ever since,
00:38:45 played every Egavania that exists.
00:38:47 Does history still like Egavanias?
00:38:50 Has the worm turned on us?
00:38:50 I think there's so bad rap these days.
00:38:52 I think they're somewhat contentious
00:38:54 from what I understand.
00:38:55 I feel like for a while,
00:38:56 it looks really nice.
00:38:57 That definitely looks really nice.
00:38:58 It was like the best game on PlayStation.
00:38:59 Everyone loved it shit.
00:39:00 And then there was a million imitators.
00:39:02 I feel like maybe like the years and years of imitators
00:39:05 soured people on the whole formula a little bit.
00:39:07 I think that's probably a large part of it.
00:39:08 I think the ego raptor kind of started turning that
00:39:10 when he did the Sequelitis on Castlevania
00:39:12 and kind of shit on the RPG ones
00:39:14 and saying that the classics were better.
00:39:15 I think that kind of started shifting
00:39:17 that's understandable in a big way.
00:39:19 You know what?
00:39:20 Now that I've played a lot more games since I played,
00:39:23 I mean, whatever,
00:39:23 I played Order of Ecclesia in college,
00:39:26 which was where you play Shanoa.
00:39:27 That was like the last real Castlevania game
00:39:31 and or the last main Egavania.
00:39:33 There's been a couple like Lords of Shadows,
00:39:34 piece of shit, don't care, no interest,
00:39:36 tried them, terrible.
00:39:39 And this one was the next,
00:39:41 this is like really the continuation.
00:39:42 So it's a spiritual successor, right?
00:39:45 Castlevania is basically dead.
00:39:46 At least the game, the style of game that I cared about
00:39:49 that Konami used to make, Konami, whatever.
00:39:51 They're not making video games anymore basically at all.
00:39:53 That's fine.
00:39:53 So it's up to the little guys to make it
00:39:55 with kick starters and whatever we got.
00:39:57 Played the game, I beat the game like an hour
00:40:01 before we started filming.
00:40:02 I beat like the true final boss
00:40:04 and I'm at like 99.8% math completion
00:40:08 and I've been trying to find that last 0.2%
00:40:10 and it's pissing me off.
00:40:11 I can't fucking find what room I missed,
00:40:13 but that's okay.
00:40:14 I am loving it.
00:40:15 Oh, and I was gonna say to someone's point
00:40:17 about like the old games being better.
00:40:19 It is very much on my mind that I'm able to like RPG style
00:40:22 brute force many of the bosses in this game
00:40:25 that like I'm not using skill.
00:40:27 I'm using like stats and the ability to just use potions.
00:40:30 And so that's pretty embarrassing
00:40:32 to realize I'm doing that.
00:40:33 But whatever, man.
00:40:35 I'm just loving the game overall.
00:40:36 Maybe I'll do like a hard mode game.
00:40:38 You talking about the blood stains?
00:40:39 Yes, that's correct.
00:40:40 That's correct.
00:40:41 What was the other one, the like NES version one?
00:40:44 No, that was all for this, wasn't it?
00:40:47 Yeah, and I also-
00:40:47 There was Curse of the Moon, right?
00:40:49 Curse, that's right.
00:40:50 It's like Bloodstained Curse of the Moon.
00:40:51 I got that game as well.
00:40:53 I played it all the way through
00:40:54 and that's like a classic NES.
00:40:55 I got to the final boss and like died on it a couple of times
00:40:58 and I was like, I'll come back and beat this later.
00:41:00 I feel like I basically got 100% out of it
00:41:02 though I didn't quite beat the final boss.
00:41:03 So I'm a relatively inexperienced on Bloodstained stuff now.
00:41:06 I've played the two games that exist for it.
00:41:07 Yeah, you could say I'm an epic gamer.
00:41:10 I'm gonna go for at least 100% completion of the map,
00:41:13 but I mean, that's very little left to do.
00:41:14 Okay, but none of this is to my point.
00:41:16 My point is I respect the effort that made Bloodstained.
00:41:21 I legitimately, I'd use the word loved
00:41:23 because it's so nostalgic.
00:41:25 The idea of exploring the castle, completing the map,
00:41:27 getting these power-ups.
00:41:28 I mean, and I love Metroidvanias.
00:41:30 They're like my favorite genre, if you wanna call them that.
00:41:33 But it makes me feel nervous about the future of games
00:41:39 because the point I wanna make about them
00:41:41 is like Konami, big company, lots of people,
00:41:45 they said like, fuck video games.
00:41:47 They're not sustainable anymore, whatever.
00:41:49 We're not gonna emphasize them
00:41:50 at least the way we used to.
00:41:51 And so the Igavenia, like the man behind them,
00:41:54 the Igavenia style, it's like,
00:41:55 okay, well I'll take care of it.
00:41:57 It strikes me as almost hopeless.
00:42:00 I feel hopeless about the future of games
00:42:03 because it's very rare for a game like Bloodstained
00:42:08 to be created and it seems far more common
00:42:10 for things to just go away and never come back
00:42:14 in my experience.
00:42:15 And I don't know, I feel, again, love the game
00:42:20 but it just made me think like, oh, I wish this happened more.
00:42:22 I wish this seemed like a realistic hope for the future
00:42:26 that there would be more.
00:42:27 I mean, there've been a ton of Metroidvanias
00:42:29 that have come out over the last couple years.
00:42:30 Yeah, and what we were just saying,
00:42:32 like the fact that they were constantly iterated upon
00:42:35 sort of eventually made people get tired of the genre.
00:42:40 Well, true.
00:42:41 How much iteration is too much iteration?
00:42:44 I think how many more?
00:42:45 Chidoration.
00:42:46 I can only play like one video game
00:42:49 before I'm just sick of the whole medium.
00:42:51 And frankly, I'm not even specifically,
00:42:53 like this goes to what we were discussing before.
00:42:55 I'm not specifically talking about Metroidvanias.
00:42:57 Like, Metroidvanias are like,
00:42:58 Hollow Knight came out like two years ago,
00:42:59 like best game I've played in years.
00:43:01 Would you say that Hollow Knight is more of,
00:43:04 actually, no, I guess it is more of a Metroid-like
00:43:07 than a Castlevania, isn't it?
00:43:09 I mean, I definitely just put it in that.
00:43:12 You level up by getting health upgrades
00:43:14 and things like that, but you don't get like XP to spend.
00:43:19 Unlike some people, I find the Metroidvania label
00:43:22 to be very useful, and so I'm happy to apply it to both games.
00:43:26 I know what you're talking about when you say it.
00:43:28 Indeed.
00:43:29 I know what you're talking about,
00:43:30 but I do prefer the distinction
00:43:32 between Castlevania and the Metroid,
00:43:35 just because anything with XP feels a lot different.
00:43:38 There is a distinction.
00:43:39 Sure.
00:43:40 I mean, absolutely.
00:43:41 The ability to grind through an area
00:43:43 to get more powerful is like a big gameplay difference.
00:43:47 It is a big gameplay difference,
00:43:48 and actually one of the things that I love about,
00:43:51 like Aria of Sorrow Castlevania did the thing
00:43:53 that I love most about, like, Igavenias,
00:43:56 and Bloodstains of this, Order of Ecclesia did this.
00:43:59 Portrait of Ruin, I think, did this.
00:44:00 It's become, at least I think Portrait of Ruin did.
00:44:02 It's become way more popular as time has gone on.
00:44:04 Yeah, Portrait did do it.
00:44:05 And it's the thing that even Symphony of the Night
00:44:08 didn't do, and so I think this is an improvement.
00:44:10 It's that every enemy in those games
00:44:13 can give you the power of that enemy.
00:44:15 So the game, it's not just like,
00:44:16 where Symphony of the Night, you gotta get through the game,
00:44:18 find the totems that have the relics or whatever
00:44:22 that you need to access certain powers.
00:44:24 I like better in the new game.
00:44:26 The enemies feel like a real important part of the game
00:44:29 because every single enemy drops a soul
00:44:32 or a shard in this game or whatever,
00:44:35 a sigil or something that gives you a specific power.
00:44:38 And so it's like, oh wow, I can really connect
00:44:40 and kind of even role play if I want to
00:44:43 as a specific current magic user.
00:44:45 I did like that in, I mean they did,
00:44:47 was it Aria of Sorrow they did that in?
00:44:49 Yeah, Aria of Sorrow.
00:44:50 That was pretty cool.
00:44:52 A lot of the abilities were bad.
00:44:54 A ton of them were shit.
00:44:56 A lot of them were just reskins of other ones.
00:44:59 But still, the fact that it sort of turned it
00:45:04 into a collectathon, you gotta catch them all.
00:45:08 Yeah, I mean the great thing about a system like that
00:45:11 is that it kind of gives the grinding a higher purpose
00:45:16 because you're doing a lot of backtracking in these games.
00:45:20 It's actually, I just re-released a video
00:45:21 in Ion Games talking about this in relation to Metroid
00:45:24 because this is something that Metroid totally misses
00:45:27 is that when you're going back and forth in Metroid,
00:45:31 the enemies are just impediments.
00:45:33 They don't give you anything.
00:45:35 So when you're doing your backtracking in those games,
00:45:37 you're just like, oh, I gotta get past those cracks.
00:45:39 What is your incentive to kill any enemy in Metroid?
00:45:42 There's literally none.
00:45:43 Exactly, and in Castlevania there's always new abilities
00:45:46 and all these enemies that potentially give you something.
00:45:49 Even above, just the fact of killing them to get experience,
00:45:52 which can cap out and to get their soul
00:45:55 just so you have the power,
00:45:56 there's I think a very important system
00:45:58 of you can level up the souls.
00:46:01 If you get more souls from a certain enemy, it powers it up.
00:46:04 So you feel like every enemy you kill
00:46:06 has real weight to it
00:46:08 and is actually improving your character.
00:46:10 And I gotta say, to me,
00:46:11 that's one of the best things you can do.
00:46:13 That's like, even if the game goes.
00:46:15 I don't know.
00:46:16 Just like Pokemon Go.
00:46:18 I mean, kind of like that.
00:46:19 Hollow Knight, for example, doesn't have EXP,
00:46:21 but it does have money, and money is very important.
00:46:24 But later in the game, you can run out of money,
00:46:26 or you can buy everything you need to buy,
00:46:28 and then you hit that wall
00:46:30 of there's nothing to grind for anymore.
00:46:32 But a game like this, I'm not saying it's perfect,
00:46:34 I could understand why people like other systems differently,
00:46:36 but that is a relatively unique benefit
00:46:40 of having this system in place.
00:46:41 I've got so many weedles,
00:46:43 I don't know, I can't even count them at this point,
00:46:45 but every single time I do, I get candy,
00:46:48 and then I can transfer them,
00:46:49 and then I can upgrade my weedles and the cocooners,
00:46:52 then I can upgrade my cocooners and the B-drills.
00:46:55 I get that sweet, sweet EXP every single time.
00:46:58 I wanna catch every Pokemon.
00:46:59 I do see the appeal of killing enemies in your way,
00:47:04 being beneficial in some small way with EXP or something.
00:47:09 But there's something.
00:47:10 There's something maybe specifically
00:47:12 about the Metroid games that I enjoy,
00:47:15 that the platforming and the ice beam
00:47:19 and the speed at which you can dodge past enemies
00:47:23 or the powers that allow you to just jump
00:47:25 and screw attack, kill enemies,
00:47:27 just sort of makes the obstacles less of a,
00:47:31 it's more fun.
00:47:33 Well, I wouldn't go so far as to say it's more fun,
00:47:35 but I definitely prefer the feeling of progression
00:47:38 through being able to easily and nonchalantly
00:47:42 smash or dodge or run past enemies
00:47:44 that were once big annoyances.
00:47:46 Well, there's definitely a lot of mobility upgrades you get
00:47:48 in most Castlevania II, which is to this point,
00:47:51 which I very much enjoy.
00:47:52 Let me just give you one highlight,
00:47:53 which actually, you could do something like this
00:47:55 exactly in a Metroid or a Hollow Knight,
00:47:57 and there are moments like it, but it's what I love.
00:48:00 It's that you can get to the end of the game in Bloodstain.
00:48:02 I guess this is minor spoilers, but nothing major,
00:48:05 just a small little fun thing I liked,
00:48:07 part of the progression.
00:48:08 It's that early in the game,
00:48:09 there's just a big blood fountain,
00:48:11 and it just seems like a set piece,
00:48:13 and it's like, oh, wow, this is, you know,
00:48:15 ooh, spooky, you know, Vampire Castle or whatever,
00:48:17 big blood fountain.
00:48:18 And if you look on the map,
00:48:20 you can see that there's actually a hole at the bottom,
00:48:23 but you can't get through that hole,
00:48:25 and it's like, hmm, I wonder what that's about.
00:48:26 That definitely is gonna be something later.
00:48:28 It's a symbolism for my incel lifestyle.
00:48:31 Exactly.
00:48:33 Damn.
00:48:34 So later in the game, later in the game,
00:48:36 you gotta find new ways to progress to explore.
00:48:38 A hole covered in blood, think about it.
00:48:40 Makes sense.
00:48:41 Makes sense.
00:48:42 Throw up.
00:48:43 There's a vampire, there's a vampire lady,
00:48:46 and it's specifically said that like, hey,
00:48:48 you know, there's a vampire who can like,
00:48:51 absorb blood without even sucking on you,
00:48:53 without even touching you, she can suck your blood.
00:48:55 How does that work?
00:48:56 So you go hunter down, and you kill her,
00:48:59 and you get her soul or her shard or whatever,
00:49:01 and it lets you like, absorb blood from enemies.
00:49:04 So now, if you ever up against an enemy,
00:49:05 you use this spell or whatever,
00:49:07 and it just, boom, it sucks blood from them,
00:49:08 you get healed, they take some damage.
00:49:10 If they have blood, it doesn't work on like, skeletons.
00:49:12 So that's already pretty cool.
00:49:13 But if you go to this one fucking place,
00:49:15 the big blood pool, and you use the spell,
00:49:18 boom, you use the thing, and it's like a little thing,
00:49:19 you absorb all the blood, and there, it's empty,
00:49:21 and you got a place you can advance now,
00:49:23 progress the game, it's awesome.
00:49:25 You know what I like about that?
00:49:26 Yeah.
00:49:27 Is that probably means that in the game, right,
00:49:29 in like the game's enemy data,
00:49:31 there is probably a tag that someone had to go through
00:49:34 in every monster entry and manually edit
00:49:37 to specify has blood, does not have blood.
00:49:41 That's a super specific ability,
00:49:43 like whether or not you can drain blood from them.
00:49:45 So yeah, every enemy probably has that switch toggled.
00:49:48 And it should, like, I basically 100% of the game
00:49:50 in terms of exploration.
00:49:52 I haven't done every little thing.
00:49:53 Oh, you know what?
00:49:55 I'll just say while we're talking about blood,
00:49:56 so we can move on.
00:49:57 But like, the moment I had, after I beat the game,
00:49:59 beat the true final boss, and I just came back,
00:50:01 because in the end credits, I noticed that I see,
00:50:04 there's a little image of Miriam sitting at a piano
00:50:08 with a little familiar that you get throughout the game.
00:50:10 It's this little like pink pixie thing,
00:50:12 Cognazzo or something,
00:50:13 which I think means like song or something.
00:50:16 And she's sitting at a piano playing it,
00:50:17 and I'm like, I remember that piano.
00:50:19 I never did anything with that piano.
00:50:21 I tried to play it, but she didn't,
00:50:22 I'm gonna go back and do that.
00:50:24 So I go, I equip the little pixie fairy.
00:50:26 I equip, or I, you know, I get fucking Miriam.
00:50:29 I go to the piano, I sit down,
00:50:31 and not only does Miriam start to play the piano,
00:50:34 but the little pixie fairy starts to sing along
00:50:37 in a live-action English voice,
00:50:39 sing like a song to the main theme of Bloodstained,
00:50:42 which is, that's just classic Igorvania
00:50:44 putting that stuff in.
00:50:45 And by the way, I tested it.
00:50:46 If you sit there and you play without the fairy equipped,
00:50:49 she still plays the piano medley,
00:50:51 but there's no voice saying along.
00:50:53 But then if you equip the fairy,
00:50:55 then it does sing along, and you get the full,
00:50:57 I was, that was the moment when I,
00:50:59 I reflected at this moment of like,
00:51:03 even figuring out the difference between
00:51:04 having the fairy and not having it,
00:51:06 I reflected on like, wow, this game was awesome.
00:51:09 And I had such a great time playing it.
00:51:11 I love these details.
00:51:12 I sat back in my chair and I said,
00:51:13 maybe video games can be art after all.
00:51:19 Exactly, exactly.
00:51:21 I was, I felt lots of gratitude,
00:51:23 and it was a great, it was a great game.
00:51:24 Highly recommend it, highly recommend it.
00:51:25 Ben, something you just said remind me
00:51:27 of something in my own life when you were saying
00:51:29 that you had to tag every single enemy
00:51:31 if it has blood or doesn't have blood.
00:51:32 That reminds me of something that you may relate to.
00:51:36 I was doing my favorite activity just earlier today,
00:51:38 and that's duplicating code unnecessarily
00:51:41 and cluttering up a mini Python file.
00:51:45 Excellent.
00:51:46 That's my favorite, yeah.
00:51:48 So I had joy, much like, you know,
00:51:50 tagging if blood, do this.
00:51:52 I was tagging if dismembered limb of slime zodia,
00:51:58 then add to this unwrap trading card pack function.
00:52:04 Is that true?
00:52:04 Yes.
00:52:05 How much of this is made, okay.
00:52:06 No, Ben.
00:52:07 Wait, are we getting, are we getting sea creatures?
00:52:12 Indeed we are, Ben.
00:52:14 So it's not a-
00:52:15 No!
00:52:16 Oh, no.
00:52:17 And by no I mean, yes.
00:52:20 So it's not a playable game,
00:52:25 but the trading cards are there,
00:52:27 and you'll be able to assemble slime zodia
00:52:29 and smelt it together for some disastrous results.
00:52:32 What happens then, I wanna know.
00:52:34 Well, I'll have you know that even if you are a goon
00:52:39 of GitHub sorts, you will not be able to understand
00:52:42 or to read the flavor text I have written
00:52:45 for the Forbidden 111, or the Forbidden Stuffed Cross
00:52:49 that you can, that you can smelt
00:52:51 by smelting together 128 double stuffed crust pizzas.
00:52:56 You will not be able to read it,
00:52:58 because I put it in a specific off,
00:53:02 like an off GitHub Python file
00:53:06 that I've given exclusively to Magic,
00:53:08 so you will have to literally get it in game
00:53:10 in order to understand and to read the flavor text.
00:53:13 Or else you will not be able to read it, yeah.
00:53:15 So okay, this is an announcement.
00:53:16 Click on the link in the description.
00:53:18 Do it, do it now.
00:53:19 Do it now.
00:53:20 Yeah, is it on slimecorp.net?
00:53:24 No, listen, they don't own the scan.
00:53:28 They don't own everything that happens in it.
00:53:29 This is not, they don't own the city.
00:53:31 Well, I'll have to send them a memo and we can fix that.
00:53:36 Yeah, Ben, listen, come back, please, God, come back.
00:53:41 I was, you know, I've been, you know,
00:53:43 I churned out the last Vapors 3
00:53:45 and I've been working on like commissions and stuff.
00:53:47 I think, I gotta like draw a cover for Vapors 2
00:53:50 before the kickstart and stuff.
00:53:51 Oh, maybe after that I'll like take a step back
00:53:54 and just go back to coding for a while.
00:53:57 That sounds like it could be a kind of change of pace
00:54:00 that I need.
00:54:01 Code, you just gotta put in some FaceTime, you know?
00:54:03 Wait a minute, I've got a controversial subject
00:54:07 to bring up regarding this.
00:54:08 And it's, Ben, I was just thinking about this.
00:54:11 And I was just wondering what the hell took so long
00:54:16 to get a new chapter out.
00:54:18 I was trying to crunch the numbers
00:54:19 to see when the last chapter had come out.
00:54:21 And interestingly, this is a big call out
00:54:23 that I'm about to do.
00:54:24 I couldn't help but go to your Patreon,
00:54:27 which I noticed your Patreon exists specifically
00:54:30 to finance creation of these comics.
00:54:32 So I was thinking like.
00:54:33 That is the stated, that is the stated goal.
00:54:36 And I, now I do not back you or anyone on Patreon
00:54:40 or anywhere else because I'm a hero.
00:54:43 However, Michelle does, and I was encouraging Michelle
00:54:46 and all her cohorts to grill you and to force you
00:54:51 into submission, to produce faster content.
00:54:54 Do you know how long it's been
00:54:55 since like the last chapter, whatever came out?
00:54:57 Yeah, don't, yeah.
00:54:59 You think I haven't thought about this?
00:55:01 I was saying, I'm sure you have.
00:55:02 I'm sure you think about more than anybody else,
00:55:04 but nonetheless.
00:55:05 It was like, well, you're talking about since Vapors 2?
00:55:10 I was thinking like since your last, you know,
00:55:12 big comic release, which I guess would be,
00:55:14 no, wasn't it the champion was the most recent one?
00:55:16 There was, well, there was, okay, there was the champion
00:55:19 and then there was Beast Capades
00:55:21 and then there was Endless War.
00:55:24 So those are some things.
00:55:24 Nobody loves Beast Capades more than me.
00:55:26 Oh, I forgot about Endless War, that's true.
00:55:28 Yeah, those are things that happen in the interim.
00:55:30 Yeah, I know when you crunch the numbers,
00:55:34 it comes out to like less than a page a week,
00:55:39 which is bad.
00:55:41 But, you know, remember that Vapors 3
00:55:44 is not the only thing that was going on in that period.
00:55:48 That's true, that's true.
00:55:49 Although if I was your patron,
00:55:51 I would, you know, up the pledge insanely, Ben,
00:55:55 because I just loved Vapors 3.
00:55:57 I thought I wasn't gonna go there.
00:55:58 Okay, but I mean, I talked about this the other day
00:56:01 or two weeks ago when I said like, you know,
00:56:04 I had been working on Endless War a lot
00:56:07 and then I had realized like I'm pretty sure
00:56:09 that like my patron, I mean, technically,
00:56:12 if you patron me, you support anything that I do.
00:56:17 Is that what's stated there though?
00:56:18 It, yeah, what's explicitly stated
00:56:20 is that it's about, it's that it's for comics.
00:56:22 And eventually I was like, you know,
00:56:23 I'm pretty sure most of my patrons
00:56:25 are patrons for the comics.
00:56:26 This is why I'm like, I need to get a comic out.
00:56:30 I need to get the next comic out.
00:56:31 The reason this is on my mind
00:56:33 is because I just did an update of my Patreon
00:56:35 and I was like, I wanna make,
00:56:37 I mean, to me it's, I wanna be super clear
00:56:39 exactly what I owe these people,
00:56:41 specifically so that no one can bother me if I'm, you know,
00:56:44 as long as I'm abiding by the agreement,
00:56:46 I want there to be no room for anyone
00:56:48 to get on my case about anything.
00:56:50 But I mean, as a non-pagent of yours,
00:56:52 I am just here selfishly demanding
00:56:54 that you produce things faster for me
00:56:57 because they're good and they're my favorite thing you do.
00:57:00 And I want Biscopades now, Ben, now.
00:57:05 Soon.
00:57:06 Okay, good.
00:57:07 Excellent.
00:57:08 There you go.
00:57:09 Fantastic.
00:57:10 Yeah.
00:57:12 Okay, that's it.
00:57:13 All right.
00:57:13 Okay.
00:57:14 Did my due diligence.
00:57:15 To go back to video games.
00:57:17 Of course.
00:57:18 There was an article that I stumbled upon on Twitter
00:57:20 that blew my mind to shit a few days ago.
00:57:24 So you guys know about Eve online.
00:57:27 You ever heard about Eve online?
00:57:28 Yeah, I know that.
00:57:29 That's like people are very, very heavily involved
00:57:34 to the point of having whole societies within the game.
00:57:36 It's like literally another world.
00:57:38 So there was an article from PC Gamer.
00:57:40 Oh, shut up.
00:57:41 Mr. Beetong, Mr. Beetong did a video.
00:57:44 Was it specifically about Eve online
00:57:46 or was it about emergent gameplay?
00:57:47 Or was it the one about Shandification?
00:57:50 There's one of his videos.
00:57:51 It might be the Shandification one.
00:57:53 Go check that out.
00:57:54 I don't know.
00:57:55 There's one where he talks about emergent gameplay
00:57:56 and he talks about Eve online and the war between,
00:57:59 oh fuck, there were the band of brothers
00:58:02 and some of the band of sisters.
00:58:04 Two like player driven factions that were like
00:58:07 not actually part of the game at all.
00:58:10 It was like purely a user driven faction system
00:58:14 that emerged and like a war rage
00:58:16 between these two factions for years and it was sick.
00:58:19 It's fascinating.
00:58:20 It's okay, but I found this article on PC Gamer
00:58:25 talking about something that happened
00:58:27 a couple days ago in Eve online.
00:58:30 And it doesn't read like an article about a video game.
00:58:34 It reads like a wiki article
00:58:36 on like an actual like piece of fiction,
00:58:39 but they're talking about like real people.
00:58:41 It's fucking insane.
00:58:43 So I'm gonna link the article right now,
00:58:45 but I will attempt to summarize it.
00:58:47 The idea here is that most games,
00:58:51 like when they do a big content update,
00:58:53 they like make a big deal out of it at E3
00:58:55 and you wait like a year.
00:58:56 Eve online just sicked an entire alien race
00:59:00 on the entire galaxy with no warning at all.
00:59:04 People just woke up and half their shit was destroyed
00:59:07 and there was this huge guy.
00:59:09 The board fucking invaded all at once.
00:59:11 Yeah, three days ago.
00:59:12 Yeah, that's basically the board.
00:59:13 Three days ago.
00:59:14 And there's the article goes in on how like
00:59:16 there was a huge like a war going on
00:59:19 between two faction, two player factions.
00:59:21 They prematurely ended the war
00:59:23 and teams started fighting the fucking invaders.
00:59:27 Like basically all of their like systems they had programmed
00:59:31 to like keep track of like their bases and things
00:59:34 because like it's a huge fucking galaxy.
00:59:35 None of it was even like coded with the understanding
00:59:39 that NPCs could trigger things like this.
00:59:41 So none of the like preparations
00:59:43 for keeping their shit safe was prepared
00:59:45 for this NPC invasion.
00:59:46 And like the entire like population
00:59:49 is in turmoil right now.
00:59:50 And it's fucking fascinating to think
00:59:52 that something like this is like real and happening.
00:59:55 It's like the most like interesting article
00:59:58 to read through this like these people
01:00:00 are like this guy's like a diplomat
01:00:02 for this player faction, the test alliance
01:00:06 and like the Imperium.
01:00:07 And there's these huge big things
01:00:08 and like they have to like completely change
01:00:10 how they're playing this game
01:00:12 because there's this huge new third party
01:00:14 that was not accounted for by anyone.
01:00:16 Like an AI party.
01:00:17 Yeah.
01:00:18 And it's just like, and like again,
01:00:19 like Eve online had the like the balls of like
01:00:22 no one is gonna know this is gonna happen
01:00:23 until it's too late.
01:00:24 We're not gonna hype it up or anything.
01:00:26 It's just dropping.
01:00:28 Not to be.
01:00:29 Just like an alien invasion would do.
01:00:31 They wouldn't announce it.
01:00:32 Exactly.
01:00:33 Yo, let me just not to be overly like,
01:00:35 not to have overly high expectations
01:00:37 for something like this,
01:00:38 but this is in Star Trek Deep Space Nine.
01:00:41 The main premise of like,
01:00:43 I think episode one of Deep Space Nine,
01:00:45 Commander Sisko takes over and a wormhole opens.
01:00:49 And it's all like a spiritual thing.
01:00:51 There's some religious stuff going on.
01:00:52 But more importantly to me is that this wormhole
01:00:56 has incredible gigantic tactical implications
01:00:59 because it opens directly
01:01:00 to the heart of the Delta Quadrant.
01:01:03 So everything in Star Trek takes place
01:01:04 in the Alpha Quadrant.
01:01:05 This is the Delta Quadrant
01:01:06 that had never been explored by anyone
01:01:09 in the Alpha Quadrant at this point, I think.
01:01:13 And like the fucking, like what this does,
01:01:16 it opens directly onto a gigantic like opposing force.
01:01:21 What's it called?
01:01:22 Not the Federation, something, something else.
01:01:24 I'll look it up and those guys were like,
01:01:26 like it just now there's a direct hold
01:01:29 that leads from like the center
01:01:31 of this enemy races territory.
01:01:33 Or it's like, it's more than one race,
01:01:34 like an entire, they control the entire Quadrant
01:01:37 versus the Alpha Quadrant.
01:01:39 And like, okay, what I was gonna ask is,
01:01:41 so in that it's Star Trek obviously.
01:01:43 So like battle tactics are relevant,
01:01:45 but mostly it's about diplomacy
01:01:47 and there's some assassination stuff that's attempted
01:01:50 because like every organization has leaders
01:01:52 and people you could theoretically try to take out.
01:01:54 I'm wondering, is there any like ability
01:01:58 to do stuff on that level
01:02:00 or is it purely like NPCs we need to kill
01:02:03 and get their HP to zero?
01:02:04 I don't, it doesn't really specify.
01:02:06 Cause like this is all happening in real time.
01:02:08 This reads like a news report.
01:02:09 Is there any chance we could negotiate?
01:02:11 What if we could form an alliance with them?
01:02:13 God damn it.
01:02:13 Like listen to this, it says,
01:02:15 as it says like as tasks scrambled
01:02:18 to muster pilots into action, reports quickly spread
01:02:21 that attacks like this were not just happening to them,
01:02:24 but elsewhere throughout the NullSec reasons of new Eden.
01:02:27 Chinese Alliance fraternity had to,
01:02:29 had at least one of their own star bases sieged
01:02:32 while the Imperium had to prematurely end a war campaign
01:02:34 against the rival empire.
01:02:36 So it could quickly retreat home
01:02:37 and mount a defensive its own stations.
01:02:39 Meanwhile, pandemic court had a special structure
01:02:42 they built known as a jump bridge outright destroyed.
01:02:45 More and more reports are coming in by the hour
01:02:47 leading to an unprecedented ceasefire
01:02:49 between all of Yvonne line's warring factions
01:02:52 as they focus on defense.
01:02:54 All warring factions, incredible.
01:02:56 That fucking um, um,
01:02:58 Vite,
01:02:58 Vite was right.
01:02:59 The Watchmen, yeah, exactly the same thing.
01:03:01 The only thing that can unite us.
01:03:02 Azimandius was right all along.
01:03:03 He was right.
01:03:04 It's just, I mean, I know like the moment to moment
01:03:06 gameplay in Yv is not anything to write home about.
01:03:09 You know, it's very kind of like,
01:03:10 like super hardcore nerdy,
01:03:12 but like just, just the meta of it
01:03:15 is just so fucking sick.
01:03:16 And it makes me wish I was like 10 times more gay
01:03:19 so I could get into this game and enjoy it.
01:03:20 Yeah, I wish I had been there.
01:03:22 I wish I'd been like a long time player
01:03:24 just doing my fucking, you know,
01:03:26 running my freighter.
01:03:26 Oh, you know, I'm just, you know,
01:03:28 I run freight from the Imperium to the other guys.
01:03:30 I'm neutral.
01:03:31 So, you know, and then all of a sudden on the horizon,
01:03:34 all these alien ships suddenly appear
01:03:36 in an unprecedented invasion
01:03:38 from a fucking other quadrant or whatever.
01:03:40 And everyone scrambles and is forced to fucking,
01:03:43 oh my God, that's incredible.
01:03:45 That's so cool dude.
01:03:45 A fucking cooler shit.
01:03:46 A fucking lecture, a lecture on Yvonne line stories
01:03:49 would be the best thing.
01:03:51 Yv totally deserves a lecture.
01:03:52 It's one of the most fascinating gaming worlds out there.
01:03:55 Anyone know how old Eva's?
01:03:56 Is it like 30 years old or something?
01:03:58 It's not 30, I don't think it's that old.
01:04:00 It's probably at least 20.
01:04:01 It's gotta be pushing that.
01:04:02 I mean, I, the first time I played Yvon line
01:04:06 cause I tried it out was in like 2006.
01:04:09 Okay, it was released 2003.
01:04:11 So it is 16 years old now, it looks like.
01:04:14 Yeah.
01:04:15 Fascinating.
01:04:16 Sounds about right.
01:04:17 Plays from the star system and tests this whole region.
01:04:19 Every fucking dude who played Yvon line
01:04:21 just had their 16 year subscription justified.
01:04:25 They are now part of the glorious human campaign
01:04:28 to fight off this evil entity that needs to be destroyed
01:04:32 and prevented from assimilating us into their collective.
01:04:35 It's so cool.
01:04:36 So cool.
01:04:37 If I were.
01:04:38 Imagine, wait, imagine you rush home.
01:04:40 Mom, mom, I can't go to school today.
01:04:42 The Imperium is being attacked by the fucking the others.
01:04:45 I can't go to school.
01:04:46 I can't pause the game mom.
01:04:48 There's no pausing in Yvon line.
01:04:50 For that to be true, you would have had to start playing
01:04:53 when you were one year old or else you'd be early then.
01:04:56 They started early then.
01:04:57 They started early.
01:04:58 You'd be over 18, okay.
01:04:59 No, I'm a man child.
01:05:00 My mom still makes me go to, you know,
01:05:02 cram school or something.
01:05:04 Prep school for it.
01:05:04 It's still going to cram school.
01:05:05 Yeah, that's right.
01:05:06 It's games like Yvon line.
01:05:08 No, this is normal school, but this is dating college
01:05:10 begun by the legendary Chris Chan, who you know.
01:05:14 One day I'll learn.
01:05:16 Games like Yvon line and like 2P2T are so enchanting to me
01:05:20 because of the like the real,
01:05:22 like you can't describe another way than history
01:05:25 between players in these virtual spaces.
01:05:29 Exactly.
01:05:30 The platonic ideal of a multiplayer game
01:05:33 is one where the gameplay feeds into the community
01:05:36 and the role playing, which is being, you know, conducted.
01:05:40 And that's sort of one of the pillars in those wars.
01:05:43 Just that's for that.
01:05:44 The gameplay is merely a subject of the role play
01:05:48 that's being happening and indeed online.
01:05:51 It just seems to be like a masterful execution of that.
01:05:56 Listen to this.
01:05:57 At the time of publishing this story, CCP games,
01:06:00 the company who made Eve hasn't even acknowledged
01:06:03 that half of Yvon line is actively on fire.
01:06:06 That initially led many to believe
01:06:09 that this was all some kind of horrific accident or bug,
01:06:11 but now the consensus is that this invasion was planned.
01:06:15 After all, Eve's online card expansion is called invasion.
01:06:18 I reached out to CCP games personally
01:06:21 and the spokesperson said to me,
01:06:22 they reached out to the drifters for comment,
01:06:24 but they rejected our hailing frequency.
01:06:26 The drifters.
01:06:27 You motherfucking role play pieces of shit.
01:06:29 God damn it.
01:06:30 Give us some answers.
01:06:31 If I were the devs, the what I would do or if I were the devs,
01:06:37 I would make the alien invasion like basically an AI invasion,
01:06:44 like a robot like swarm or something so that, you know,
01:06:47 they could behave like completely deterministically
01:06:51 and basically just be a fucking computer program,
01:06:55 which they are.
01:06:56 Yeah.
01:06:57 Okay, yeah, yeah.
01:06:58 And that, you know, to decrease that dreaded cognitive dissonance.
01:07:01 No, what's the word?
01:07:02 Neo.
01:07:03 Neo.
01:07:04 Ludo narrative dissonance?
01:07:05 Ludo narrative dissonance.
01:07:06 That dreaded Ludo narrative dissonance.
01:07:10 That's my opinion about that.
01:07:12 By the way, the name of the bad guys from Deep Space Nine
01:07:15 is the Dominion.
01:07:16 The Dominion runs the Gamma Quadrant.
01:07:18 Oh, shit.
01:07:19 I said the Delta Quadrant.
01:07:20 Did I fuck?
01:07:20 It's the Gamma Quadrant.
01:07:22 Oh, I look like a fucking idiot, man.
01:07:24 God damn it.
01:07:25 I'm so sorry.
01:07:26 It's in Star Trek Voyager.
01:07:28 They're in the Quadrant, the Delta.
01:07:29 You're gonna have to take a Star Trek of a short pier.
01:07:33 Role playing is simply the highest form of art.
01:07:39 Guys, don't buy in a munchies pro role play propaganda.
01:07:42 I love these role play.
01:07:43 Trying to lead you down a dark path.
01:07:45 Now, role playing is like, you're an artist,
01:07:51 you're making a character,
01:07:52 but you are just pretending to be that character.
01:07:54 Like, all art is role playing.
01:07:56 You're making the shit up.
01:07:58 God, strike me down if I ever even consider
01:08:01 the possibility of being any person
01:08:04 other than what I am.
01:08:08 As much as you may wish for that not to be the case.
01:08:10 But what are you then?
01:08:11 Unfortunately it is.
01:08:12 So I hate to harp on about it more than is necessary.
01:08:17 However, it's relevant to the conversation of role playing.
01:08:20 When I was writing things for Endless War,
01:08:23 for characters that I had to act out as though I were them
01:08:27 in multiple different Discord accounts,
01:08:29 logging in and out literally probably hundreds of times
01:08:32 in the course of a really long text conversation
01:08:35 that I had fabricated between two Discord users
01:08:38 don't actually exist.
01:08:40 It was really like, you know, the advice is to, you know,
01:08:43 just sort of like get into your character's head
01:08:45 and you know, write from their perspective
01:08:46 and you know, just really understand what's like to be them.
01:08:49 But like the actual like physical act of logging in and out
01:08:53 is like insanely helpful just to like
01:08:55 to really ram that into your fucking skull.
01:08:58 But like, yeah, you know what?
01:09:00 You really are this person, you know why?
01:09:04 Because you're in a Discord account,
01:09:05 look down at the bottom left,
01:09:06 like that's the avatar of the character that you're role playing.
01:09:10 Like it's a really like acting it out
01:09:13 in a like a literal role play scenario.
01:09:16 Like I felt like genuinely helped me write four things,
01:09:20 like write the dialogue.
01:09:22 It just felt like it was more, like I actually,
01:09:26 I believe for a moment that I was indeed in two.
01:09:30 I believe in multiple occasions.
01:09:33 Yeah, dog.
01:09:34 Hell yeah, dude, hell yeah.
01:09:36 Hey, by the way, we just briefly in there
01:09:38 mentioned 2B2T, I just want to give a shout out to our boy
01:09:41 fitMC who is blowing up these days
01:09:44 with his fucking Minecraft videos.
01:09:47 Is that like 350,000 subs now?
01:09:49 He's always been big dude.
01:09:51 When we last talked to him, he was at like 200,000.
01:09:54 He's like doubled since we last talked to him.
01:09:56 That's pretty good.
01:09:57 Well, of course, much congratulations.
01:10:00 Kind of thought Minecraft was on the decline.
01:10:03 Not while this boy's on the case.
01:10:05 It's kind of like on a sort of research.
01:10:07 Minecraft, I don't know if Minecraft could ever really
01:10:10 be considered on a decline.
01:10:13 Like even if it is literally going down, it's always.
01:10:16 It's acceleration.
01:10:16 Yeah, yeah, maybe.
01:10:17 Was not, was like less fast than before or something.
01:10:21 Yeah, I mean, I mean, I've had to.
01:10:23 It's acceleration had to slow down because like it just,
01:10:26 it's saturated the population.
01:10:28 There was like no more, there was like less, you know,
01:10:31 new territory to expand into.
01:10:34 Yeah.
01:10:35 I guess that was inevitable as you do.
01:10:39 Yeah.
01:10:40 Well, good job to fit.
01:10:42 Yep.
01:10:43 I have been like on Twitter.
01:10:45 I saw FitMC was like doing like a 2B2T.
01:10:52 Like there was a war going on with Edyka.
01:10:55 That's true.
01:10:55 And his boys jumping into the server.
01:10:58 And FitMC was backing him up and it was all cool.
01:11:01 And then it was like, ooh, Edyka guys.
01:11:04 Too bad about that, unfortunately.
01:11:06 Yeah.
01:11:08 I didn't.
01:11:09 RIP.
01:11:11 Yeah.
01:11:11 I didn't know anything about Edyka really.
01:11:13 I'd seen, I don't know, maybe a month or two ago.
01:11:16 I saw people, you know, being, you know,
01:11:19 concerned about him and like I saw a bunch of tweets
01:11:21 from his that seemed to suggest a person
01:11:24 who was maybe not stable.
01:11:26 His behavior was erratic for sure.
01:11:28 Yeah, yeah.
01:11:29 This was clear.
01:11:30 All I know him from is like the things one YouTube poops
01:11:35 where he would like chop up his reactions to things.
01:11:39 And he seemed like a pretty happy, funny, cool guy.
01:11:42 So like, I don't know what was going on with him.
01:11:45 I did hear a couple of times that he was like depressed
01:11:47 or he'd said things,
01:11:48 but I never really followed his content.
01:11:50 The term bipolar has been thrown around.
01:11:52 I don't know if that's true,
01:11:53 but it certainly seems to fit the profile.
01:11:55 He seemed like, I don't know, from his tweets,
01:11:58 it almost seemed like he was like,
01:12:00 I don't know, maybe even schizophrenic or something.
01:12:02 Like he just seemed like, you know,
01:12:05 really kind of detached at times.
01:12:08 He talked about being a God and it's hard to tell
01:12:12 exactly how much sincerity.
01:12:13 I mean, how, I don't, obviously you can't diagnose
01:12:16 this from tweets, but you know.
01:12:18 But they're just to be clear.
01:12:20 I have nothing, but I mean,
01:12:21 there were times in the past where like he went missing
01:12:24 and then a bunch of YouTubers made videos
01:12:25 being like, dude, Etika is missing.
01:12:27 Like is this a hoax?
01:12:28 Who knows?
01:12:29 Like what's going on?
01:12:30 Is this some kind of prank or ARG or something?
01:12:32 You know, on the subject,
01:12:34 this is my more controversial opinion here, I suppose.
01:12:38 It's that one, I really, I legitimately liked Etika.
01:12:41 I'm really sad about what happened to him.
01:12:42 Felt pretty emotional about it at a time.
01:12:46 So that's horrible.
01:12:48 I've said this before, but like he just subbed to me
01:12:50 and I was like, oh, that's pretty cool.
01:12:51 He seems like-
01:12:52 Wait, Etika subbed you?
01:12:53 Yeah, with his remaining channel.
01:12:54 He had subbed to my main channel.
01:12:55 Maybe for my smash videos, I don't know,
01:12:57 but I thought that was really cool.
01:13:00 That is cool.
01:13:01 Well, yeah, obviously, he was in the midst of an episode
01:13:05 when he did that, or else he must have been.
01:13:09 But I've heard on the subject of this,
01:13:12 I've heard a lot of people saying that like,
01:13:14 it was fucked up what the internet did
01:13:18 of like joking about Etika's mental state,
01:13:21 or like being overly just calling him like a faker,
01:13:25 like Keemstar, I think people were saying that he called,
01:13:27 he did call him a faker, as I understand it.
01:13:29 And like just doing it for attention or publicity stunt.
01:13:32 But so that's all, you know,
01:13:34 question of like varying degrees of like questionable
01:13:36 or possibly moral things to do, I guess.
01:13:39 But I think we're missing the point
01:13:41 if we're gonna say that like the problem here
01:13:44 was that this internet creator
01:13:46 was getting too much negative feedback from the internet.
01:13:50 And they weren't like, the internet is in no position
01:13:52 to know how serious or fucked up.
01:13:55 Like, I agree, it seems serious with this guy.
01:13:58 People probably should not like joke.
01:14:01 I mean, he died, so in hindsight.
01:14:03 Yeah, it was pretty fucking serious.
01:14:05 But I mean, what responsibility does like the people,
01:14:09 basically what I'm saying is,
01:14:10 I don't think we should really take away from this
01:14:12 that like people need to not joke
01:14:14 or not take things seriously.
01:14:16 You know, actually, maybe that would even be good.
01:14:18 My real point is that there's no hope for that.
01:14:21 That no one should, he needed like people in his life
01:14:25 that helped him as opposed to trying to get.
01:14:27 You can't blame the, I don't know, this is kind of,
01:14:32 I guess this sort of relates to my argument
01:14:35 about Meat Man a couple of weeks ago.
01:14:37 Like, you know, if you're mentally ill on the internet
01:14:43 and you're acting in a way that is erratic and weird,
01:14:46 like nobody on the other side of the keyboard
01:14:48 knows what's going on with you.
01:14:49 They're gonna react how they're gonna react
01:14:53 and like you can't, you know, you can't be like,
01:14:57 oh, well, the internet at large
01:15:00 should have done this, this, and this.
01:15:01 Like it's not something you can dictate or control.
01:15:04 I feel like there's gonna be people like Philip DeFranco
01:15:07 and others like him who will come out
01:15:08 and do like a big moralizing like the internet failed Edeca.
01:15:12 It was like their responsibility.
01:15:15 I can already, I mean, he's probably already made that video.
01:15:17 And I just think that that's not the solution, I don't think.
01:15:21 That's not gonna fix anything.
01:15:21 Yeah, you can only really be responsible for yourself.
01:15:24 Exactly.
01:15:24 Like I err on the side of caution with things like this.
01:15:27 Yeah.
01:15:27 I mean, if I was following him and I saw all this stuff,
01:15:30 I would probably not joke about it
01:15:32 because I mean, I can't like speak to how like clear it was,
01:15:39 how he was feeling or how I would have interpreted
01:15:43 what he was saying, but like to err on the side of caution
01:15:46 is to like not like laugh at someone
01:15:49 who's potentially joking about how they're depressed
01:15:53 because it's more likely that they are actually depressed.
01:15:55 We're in no position to know if they're joking or not though.
01:15:58 I mean, I well, again, sometimes it's clear.
01:16:00 I mean, it's harmless.
01:16:02 It's harmless to act concerned when they are joking.
01:16:05 Yeah.
01:16:06 But it's harmful to act not concerned
01:16:09 when they aren't joking.
01:16:10 That's true.
01:16:11 And to like Ben's point, like we said
01:16:13 with our last discussion about this kind of stuff,
01:16:15 like I totally agree that like the snowflake
01:16:18 never blanes itself for the avalanche,
01:16:20 which does strike me as like kind of what happened here.
01:16:24 I just like, and this isn't to be callous or like unfeeling
01:16:27 because I really, this affected me kind of a lot
01:16:31 like more than I expected it to and made me very, very sad
01:16:35 and other things that you have no position to trust me on
01:16:37 but I'm going to say anyway that like it's just not helpful
01:16:43 to frame things this way and yeah, like the probably this,
01:16:49 this has to be something that some people are in a situation
01:16:53 where being an internet creator,
01:16:56 like it has these consequences right now,
01:16:58 we cannot change that this is the sort of thing
01:17:00 that people do when you know, people make jokes,
01:17:04 people don't believe you, people talk shit.
01:17:06 And like someone who's vulnerable to that,
01:17:09 it's just inevitable.
01:17:10 Like do we blame the ocean for drowning people who you know,
01:17:14 like lose and again, this word blame
01:17:17 of like moral accountability.
01:17:19 I agree every individual kind of bears
01:17:21 a little bit of responsibility on it.
01:17:23 I agree with including me.
01:17:25 I mean, I kind of chuckled before I had a joke about this
01:17:27 just earlier this while I'm still sad about it.
01:17:30 So I feel like, you know, when someone, someone like
01:17:36 if you care about Erika and he's dead
01:17:39 and you're really upset,
01:17:40 you're gonna wanna blame something.
01:17:42 You're gonna wanna like, you know, you're gonna be emotional.
01:17:45 I think it's overall better that they just yell
01:17:50 at the internet, quote unquote,
01:17:52 rather than like specific people.
01:17:55 Cause like, I don't know.
01:17:57 And in the same way that like somebody might have
01:18:00 like an episode and you know,
01:18:03 they may not say what they mean or you know,
01:18:06 mean what they say and you're like,
01:18:07 if you can, if you can understand
01:18:09 that they're having a thing and it's like,
01:18:10 that's not too like the things they're saying
01:18:13 are not actually what they think,
01:18:15 then you can let it slide.
01:18:16 And I feel like in the wake of something emotionally,
01:18:20 you know, not traumatizing, but you know,
01:18:22 it affects people, they'll react in certain ways.
01:18:26 And I think getting mad at like a vague like sense
01:18:31 of like, or like being moralizing.
01:18:33 I don't think it's, it's like cynical.
01:18:36 I don't think it's entirely like a devoid of emotional.
01:18:39 I don't think it's necessarily cynical.
01:18:41 I mean, I agree with you that anybody who feels any kind
01:18:44 of way cause they like the guy, like that's fine.
01:18:46 You're feeling those feelings I can't argue with,
01:18:48 but it's the people who didn't really know Attica
01:18:51 and now are like making a case that like it's the internet.
01:18:54 That's what I got annoyed.
01:18:55 I wouldn't know who said, who didn't know him
01:18:58 or didn't know his situation unless they said so.
01:19:01 I mean, there's that one guy who made,
01:19:04 you know what, I won't get into it.
01:19:05 Like I saw H3 roasting a guy who would like,
01:19:07 he didn't actually do this, but he made a video titled
01:19:10 like Attica Ouija board ghost like conversing.
01:19:15 And this is like two days.
01:19:16 Now he didn't actually do that,
01:19:18 but he had titled the video that way.
01:19:20 So it was cut and he had made a video a couple of days before
01:19:24 where I believe he called out Attica for faking or something
01:19:27 and said that he wasn't really dead.
01:19:28 Now I don't, you shouldn't muddle those two things
01:19:32 because no one knew for sure exactly what was going on.
01:19:36 But to have made fun of him before
01:19:38 and then to be proven wrong
01:19:40 and then to title a video like that.
01:19:42 That says, that is just a scumbag move.
01:19:47 It's a little scummy.
01:19:49 I mean, I would do that.
01:19:49 I'll call out some specific people
01:19:53 and blame them for Attica's death,
01:19:55 even though the things I'm gonna criticize them for
01:19:57 are things they did afterwards.
01:19:58 From my justice, okay.
01:19:59 But still, I think we should retroactively blame them
01:20:03 for it.
01:20:04 I'm sure they're not the only ones who did this,
01:20:04 but people saw a couple of people on Twitter
01:20:07 making it all about them.
01:20:09 Like Boogie, of course,
01:20:12 professional coward and appeaser,
01:20:15 being like, I think it was like-
01:20:16 Mental health, yeah.
01:20:18 It was like, the tweet that I saw was like,
01:20:20 you know, like, you know, so sorry to hear,
01:20:23 so sorry to hear about Boogie.
01:20:25 You know, bullying is terrible.
01:20:27 You know, I have experienced bullying.
01:20:30 Fortunately for me, I experienced so much bullying
01:20:34 that I became hardened to it.
01:20:36 You know, unlike poor, poor Attica,
01:20:39 who just wasn't-
01:20:40 There are some points to that.
01:20:41 I mean, I don't hate Boogie the way you do.
01:20:42 He wasn't bullied nearly as much as me,
01:20:44 which is maybe true.
01:20:46 You know, that might be true.
01:20:47 That fucking Boogie was bullied and shit still.
01:20:50 He fucking makes this like sad tweet,
01:20:52 humble bragging about how much he's been bullied
01:20:55 and stuff in response to this Attica thing.
01:20:58 You know who else did the same thing?
01:21:00 And this was a big disappointment to me,
01:21:02 was fucking Holly Conrad.
01:21:05 Your favorite content creator, as I understand it.
01:21:07 My favorite content creator,
01:21:08 who, you know, is known for several things,
01:21:12 but most recently for being the other woman
01:21:15 in the Jared scandal.
01:21:16 And I was very disappointed because I'm very much on,
01:21:20 I'm fucking on Jared and Holly's side in that.
01:21:22 So it's disappointing to go and see Holly
01:21:25 embarrassing herself with tweets about like,
01:21:28 talking about how like cancel culture is what killed Attica
01:21:33 and like, you know, it's bad and toxic.
01:21:35 And I, you know, I've been,
01:21:37 I also have been the victim of like the internet hate mob.
01:21:41 You know, we have to end this.
01:21:42 Isn't that kind of true?
01:21:43 Well, well, I mean, first of all,
01:21:45 I mean, cancel, being canceled didn't kill Attica, right?
01:21:50 How would she know about his story though?
01:21:52 Cause I think, I believe that part of the reason
01:21:54 that he was feeling down and whatnot to this degree,
01:21:58 I like, I think it was disproportionate,
01:22:00 but it was because he had, honestly,
01:22:03 it's kind of complicated,
01:22:04 but he had like been involved with like a cult
01:22:07 in some weird way.
01:22:07 I don't know if that was specifically responsible.
01:22:09 I didn't hear this.
01:22:10 I mean, that's, that's the word that,
01:22:11 I don't know if that's actually necessarily an accurate label,
01:22:13 but like he had, he had done, you know,
01:22:17 honestly, I don't even fucking know,
01:22:18 but I know that he had done things
01:22:19 that people were criticizing him for
01:22:21 and he felt bad about it.
01:22:22 And I think that was like, so I would see where that comes
01:22:27 from if that's totally true.
01:22:28 I don't know.
01:22:29 I'm kind of talking out of my ass,
01:22:29 but that was my understanding.
01:22:30 I just think for Holly to come out
01:22:32 and basically imply like, guys,
01:22:35 what the reason Attica is dead is the same thing.
01:22:38 That happened to me too.
01:22:39 That happened to me and Jared.
01:22:41 It's like, fuck off.
01:22:42 It happened to her more so, I'd say, than Attica.
01:22:45 I don't think Attica was getting,
01:22:46 like the reason I was so shocked,
01:22:48 cause I don't think Attica had done that much.
01:22:50 Yeah. Well, exactly.
01:22:51 That's why I don't think it's like,
01:22:53 it has nothing to do with what happened with her and Jared.
01:22:56 I see a thread of connection here.
01:22:58 I see something.
01:23:00 You could draw that same thread
01:23:02 to like anyone with a following online.
01:23:04 It isn't the point, the fact not that it is true,
01:23:08 but rather that it's just, it's sort of rude
01:23:10 to just make this person talk about you.
01:23:12 Well, okay.
01:23:13 To take the most charitable interpretation
01:23:15 as I so often like to do,
01:23:17 couldn't she be saying that like, this thing is bad.
01:23:20 I've experienced this.
01:23:21 Here's another example.
01:23:22 Guys, let's get rid of this bad thing.
01:23:24 It's happening.
01:23:25 We're seeing it.
01:23:27 I understand that.
01:23:28 Well, maybe, but then think,
01:23:29 what if that bad thing,
01:23:31 what if you don't think that that bad thing she's blaming
01:23:34 is what actually is responsible?
01:23:36 Well, that's fair.
01:23:37 Her actual motivation for making that assertion
01:23:40 is just that some unrelated bad thing happened to her.
01:23:44 She's mad about it and she wants to take this death
01:23:47 and use it to decry this unrelated thing
01:23:49 that she is opposed to.
01:23:50 I mean, it's sort of equitable to like a shooting happens
01:23:54 and then everyone says the stance on gun control.
01:23:58 Yeah, it's the same thing.
01:23:59 And it's like, you know, fair enough,
01:24:01 I would just, I just don't like seeing that like immediately
01:24:06 like some sort of agenda being pushed.
01:24:09 I mean, even if it's a good cause,
01:24:11 I just like someone's dead, like, I don't know.
01:24:15 I felt personally I knew.
01:24:15 Like why do you need to feel the comment on the death?
01:24:18 I didn't even like, I mean, I retweeted like the news report
01:24:21 that Erika died.
01:24:22 I felt gross doing it, especially,
01:24:25 I tweeted about this afterward.
01:24:27 I like, I read to it and I said, like,
01:24:28 I always liked Erika, I respected him,
01:24:29 which she was, yeah, it was, it was breaking news.
01:24:32 But the thing, like, I rarely comment on serious stuff
01:24:34 like this, but I liked Erika a lot.
01:24:37 But okay, but the point, like, after that,
01:24:39 I, my brain, like, this was a response to my own tweet.
01:24:42 I saw that the, oh, wow, this is getting lots of numbers.
01:24:45 Hooray for me, getting lots of numbers.
01:24:46 Like my brain did that exercise and then I was like, ew,
01:24:50 I want to be deceased.
01:24:52 This is gross.
01:24:53 And so I said, like, I mean, this,
01:24:55 this was almost a virtue signal
01:24:56 because I'd already done it, but I was like,
01:24:59 I really wish I could get no social cred from this,
01:25:02 from this thing.
01:25:03 I want to puke when I, when my brain thinks, hooray,
01:25:05 positive numbers, but, you know.
01:25:07 I mean, in some small way, you posting it at all,
01:25:12 like, regardless of numbers would still be
01:25:14 like a social cred thing to show that you care about Erika.
01:25:17 Well, in, well, you know, existing within the attention
01:25:20 of the economy, one cannot help, but, you know,
01:25:24 have their, you know, have their...
01:25:26 We're incentivized, all right.
01:25:27 Yeah.
01:25:28 Yeah, what, like, you, you can't post something
01:25:30 on social media and not have that action tied
01:25:34 to your, you know, social worth or whatever.
01:25:37 Yeah, I mean, I feel like that's not really
01:25:40 that big of a problem, but it is like, you know,
01:25:43 it's a bit like, oh yeah, when you catch yourself doing it,
01:25:45 you feel a little stupid.
01:25:46 I just like, I fear, I fear the future
01:25:48 where I do more and more of this sort of thing.
01:25:50 And I begin to not have any, you know,
01:25:53 revulsion to my own capitalization on such things,
01:25:57 which was not, I was not cynically approaching this
01:25:59 to be clear, I am very, very sad
01:26:01 about what has to edit, it's fucked up, obviously.
01:26:04 The worst thing possible is to find yourself
01:26:07 being like okay with faking concern for clicks
01:26:11 and views and all that.
01:26:13 Man, it's fucked up.
01:26:14 I was real upset when he died, it was fucked up, man.
01:26:17 He was a cool guy, and it's like, I'm with everybody else.
01:26:20 God, this was so predictable.
01:26:22 Did you guys know he'd been in like the hospital
01:26:24 for these kind of issues twice already
01:26:26 and been released both times?
01:26:28 I know that we can't like keep against his will,
01:26:30 but I just like, I wish that the machinery
01:26:33 had worked better to save this fucking guy.
01:26:37 I mean, let's talk about that.
01:26:39 Okay.
01:26:40 How would it work better?
01:26:41 I'll give you what I would want.
01:26:42 What would that look like?
01:26:43 How would what work better?
01:26:44 The internet or like medic, or the hospital?
01:26:48 I don't know, I guess mental health in America, I suppose.
01:26:53 I mean, maybe.
01:26:53 America is real, it's super hard, as I understand,
01:26:57 to like commit people against their will
01:26:59 to like any kind of mental institution.
01:27:01 And I don't even know if necessarily I would want that.
01:27:03 I'll tell you exactly what I would want
01:27:05 in a perfect world, though.
01:27:05 In a perfect world, I wouldn't want like the government
01:27:09 to like lock this guy up until he's healthy enough to live.
01:27:12 I would want his friends and family
01:27:15 to be so concerned about him
01:27:16 and so like willing to move heaven and earth to save him
01:27:19 that they, not that he wouldn't take that much,
01:27:21 but that they're like, you know, like whatever,
01:27:22 like man, your cousin's gonna stay with you
01:27:25 and like take care and make sure you're okay
01:27:27 because you need our help and we're gonna do it.
01:27:29 I mean, I don't know if there was anyone in his life
01:27:31 who could, like his little brother had like died
01:27:33 and I think committed suicide like years ago.
01:27:36 It might have been older brother
01:27:37 and it might not be suicide, so I might be speaking wrong.
01:27:40 I'm sorry about that if I have that wrong.
01:27:42 But like he was fucked up about his brother's death
01:27:44 and for this to happen.
01:27:46 Like I would have liked his brother to be around
01:27:48 and like, you know, be able to help him
01:27:50 and get him on the right track.
01:27:51 I sometimes get the sense that that like family
01:27:56 or like best friend that's super there for you
01:27:59 is like pretty fictional.
01:28:02 Like that very often does not really happen.
01:28:05 Like people have their own shit going on.
01:28:06 I don't think anyone would do that for me,
01:28:07 not to be me, anyone in my friends or family,
01:28:09 but I think I'd be in a similar boat.
01:28:11 Like even if they would think that,
01:28:13 like they're just never right in the like mindset
01:28:18 to go that hard on trying to save someone.
01:28:22 Imagine being that cousin and like your family is like,
01:28:27 hey, you know, our boy, Attica or whatever.
01:28:31 He's having mental stuff.
01:28:34 He's having suicidal ideation.
01:28:36 He's in a rough spot.
01:28:38 We're gonna leave this guy,
01:28:40 like you gotta take care of this guy.
01:28:42 Like imagine, I mean, imagine having to,
01:28:45 imagine having to like take care of someone like that
01:28:47 who like doesn't want you to
01:28:49 and like will like fight you on it
01:28:51 and will try and like undermine you
01:28:53 and like they're in a mental state to perceive you
01:28:55 as the enemy and like they're constantly
01:28:57 on the verge of a breakdown
01:28:58 and you're the one who's there
01:29:00 and you've gotta be the one to like deal with it every time.
01:29:03 Like it's exhausting.
01:29:04 I'm not sure that Attica was in that place,
01:29:06 but it definitely could happen.
01:29:07 So I'm waiting.
01:29:08 You know what, I shouldn't have used,
01:29:09 I shouldn't have said Attica, I don't know the details,
01:29:11 but imagine doing, I'm just,
01:29:12 it pictured someone who was like,
01:29:14 like genuinely suicidal, like long-term,
01:29:17 like imagine dealing with that person,
01:29:20 especially if you're like not a professional in the field.
01:29:22 I mean, look, I'm again, maybe controversial.
01:29:25 I am prepared to say that like with our society,
01:29:28 with the amount of freedom that we aim to preserve,
01:29:31 some people will fall through the cracks
01:29:33 and that's not good, but compared to a society
01:29:36 where we, I don't know, force people to get locked up,
01:29:39 it might be a cost I'm willing to pay.
01:29:41 Nothing's perfect.
01:29:42 Nothing's perfect, exactly.
01:29:44 So you gotta pick your poison and I don't know.
01:29:47 I don't know, man.
01:29:48 You know, if someone's gonna,
01:29:49 if someone's, you know, I mean, it's tragic.
01:29:52 Yeah.
01:29:53 But if someone is, you know, for whatever reason,
01:29:55 whether mental illness or, I mean,
01:29:56 I guess it would generally be mental illness, but whatever.
01:29:59 You know, if someone's dedicated to killing themselves,
01:30:03 like they can, they can do, yeah, yeah,
01:30:06 it's hard to be, it's hard to make that impossible
01:30:10 for someone who, you know, wants to do it.
01:30:13 I think that's, yeah, that's what this was.
01:30:15 Yeah.
01:30:16 I don't know, I don't know.
01:30:16 If you're fucking dedicated to the cause or whatever.
01:30:18 I just wish people, I don't know, man.
01:30:22 I feel like the answer to this,
01:30:25 well, I think the problem largely is due
01:30:28 to like social media and the kind of negativity you can get.
01:30:32 So I get that that's like an issue and you can,
01:30:34 I don't know, you can humiliate yourself
01:30:36 and you can be attacked from every corner of the globe
01:30:38 all at once, you know, justified or not.
01:30:40 It's just something that can happen now.
01:30:42 And I don't know, like I feel like in the situations
01:30:45 like this, the kind of solution is to like,
01:30:48 in whatever way, regain perspective.
01:30:51 And if you've got like, you know, a malfunctioning brain
01:30:53 as people with mental illness do, not to disparage them,
01:30:56 like I understand that can be border impossible
01:30:59 or just difficult or whatever.
01:31:01 But like, if you're like, if you just go away
01:31:03 from the internet for like a week, let's say,
01:31:05 and you're just like, you know, hanging out with your family,
01:31:07 maybe you go on vacation somewhere or something.
01:31:09 And it's like, oh, you know, life's okay.
01:31:11 Life's not terrible.
01:31:12 It's the fact that you've got like an online job though
01:31:15 that makes you pretty vulnerable
01:31:17 to the constant waves of assault of this stuff.
01:31:20 And I don't know.
01:31:22 It seems like really, really harsh on,
01:31:27 really hard on the people who are streamers generally,
01:31:31 where they have to be like doing multiple hours a day
01:31:36 playing games or whatever it is they do.
01:31:38 And like holidays are such an impossibility
01:31:43 that they're always hooked into whatever's going on.
01:31:45 They're always online.
01:31:47 They're always entertaining.
01:31:50 And they, I mean, they work really hard
01:31:53 and they get a lot of money for it.
01:31:55 But I can't help but wonder if there's so many
01:32:00 of these streamers are like really fucking themselves up
01:32:04 due to this.
01:32:05 Mentally, I would be, yeah.
01:32:06 Mentally, yeah.
01:32:06 Even my little bit of streaming I do now,
01:32:09 there's, you know, there's a little bit of anxiety
01:32:11 and kind of pressure that goes along with it,
01:32:13 such that I don't want to do it full time.
01:32:15 That sounds, not great to me.
01:32:17 I would never want to be a streamer, just this way.
01:32:19 Imagine being on camera like eight hours a day
01:32:23 for a full work week, live on camera.
01:32:26 That's not for me.
01:32:27 That's not for me.
01:32:28 Yeah.
01:32:29 Yeah.
01:32:30 I don't know, maybe one day I'll whore myself out.
01:32:30 What are these internet things are good hobbies?
01:32:35 That's why making videos I think is healthy.
01:32:37 It still ties into the whole machine,
01:32:39 but it's like you produce, you edit down
01:32:41 what you don't like out of it.
01:32:42 It's less stressful.
01:32:44 I don't know.
01:32:45 I just like that better personally.
01:32:48 What were you saying, Munchy?
01:32:49 You were trying to.
01:32:50 Just to pivot away from this.
01:32:52 Sure.
01:32:52 To go back to fit MC to springboard off of him
01:32:56 into a tangent.
01:32:59 I said this before, but seeing worlds collide
01:33:02 on your Twitter timeline or in YouTube comments
01:33:04 specifically related to this,
01:33:06 where just you're on some video
01:33:08 and you're enjoying your life
01:33:10 and the content creators inside of it.
01:33:13 You scroll down and you see that another part
01:33:17 of your brain, another part of the people
01:33:19 and another content creator is on this other content creator
01:33:22 that you're like, oh, it's the same.
01:33:24 And when it's your own content,
01:33:26 like how it was for when I saw fit MC
01:33:30 coming on the PCP, what the fuck?
01:33:35 That's so bizarre of a thing for my perspective
01:33:40 to have this like 2B2T YouTuber that I follow
01:33:43 coming on my podcast.
01:33:46 That was strange.
01:33:47 And I had a moment like that earlier today
01:33:52 when I was scrolling through the comments
01:33:53 of the latest episode when, who do I see?
01:33:56 But fly away now, what?
01:34:00 For those of you with a, Ben, give me a way
01:34:05 to describe a brain.
01:34:06 What's a way to describe a brain
01:34:07 that's a, you'd never forget something.
01:34:10 Wait, a way to describe a brain that's what?
01:34:13 Never forget something.
01:34:14 You know, there's smooth brain.
01:34:15 A steel trap.
01:34:16 A steel trap.
01:34:17 A steel trap, mind.
01:34:18 Steel brain.
01:34:19 Steel brain.
01:34:20 For the steel brain, if you may remember that name
01:34:23 from my Deagle Nation lecture,
01:34:24 as he was a key member of Team Gamer Food.
01:34:28 And I can only assume that he just found
01:34:30 the PCP through that.
01:34:31 And then it has just been like following us since then
01:34:35 and just now has decided to comment,
01:34:38 what, fly away now, listen, I understand
01:34:40 that from your perspective, you've been living life
01:34:42 for years and that you are far removed
01:34:45 from whatever saga that you were once in at that point.
01:34:48 But to me, you're still fucking crazy, dude.
01:34:51 You think you can just comment on the PCP?
01:34:53 That's insane.
01:34:54 Fly away now, isn't the PCP, what?
01:34:58 So shout out to Fly Away Now,
01:34:59 what I think is listening right now.
01:35:00 Dude, you should be on the show.
01:35:01 Yeah.
01:35:02 What?
01:35:03 That's crazy.
01:35:04 That's crazy, talk.
01:35:06 I don't know what you think.
01:35:07 PCP, I'm sorry.
01:35:09 Film C, we just lurk in the shadows.
01:35:11 Fly away now, just lurk in the shadows.
01:35:14 Who else?
01:35:15 Who other?
01:35:16 When is PewDiePie finally gonna comment?
01:35:17 He's gonna comment that I love the door.
01:35:20 PewDiePie Notch?
01:35:21 We know Notch is watching our Primo Minecraft discussions.
01:35:25 He's here.
01:35:26 Yeah, Notch is a Mumkey Jones fan.
01:35:29 Like, he's probably all up in the war.
01:35:32 The thing about Notch that's fascinating.
01:35:34 I mean, we had everyone's favorite Florian Hemsel.
01:35:39 Indeed, indeed.
01:35:41 Hey, you know, news about Florian Hemsel,
01:35:43 he's a lib now.
01:35:44 I'm so excited.
01:35:45 We did it, gamers.
01:35:47 We made him, he put out a video being like,
01:35:50 yeah, I used to be edgy and like triggering the libs,
01:35:52 but actually I think maybe they make some good points.
01:35:55 Wow, that's going to change.
01:35:56 And I left a long comment being like,
01:35:59 here's my favorite left tubers.
01:36:00 No, not to mean that.
01:36:01 Don't go watch them and get radicalized.
01:36:03 Get radicalized.
01:36:04 He's gonna make a game now, the binding of capitalism.
01:36:07 Ah, I'm just curious, was this,
01:36:10 did this seem like, you know,
01:36:11 well thought out and legitimate or was it, you know,
01:36:14 kind of, okay, okay, good.
01:36:16 Yeah, it's just him being like,
01:36:17 so you know, here's the stuff I used to say
01:36:19 and here's some thoughts I have about politics nowadays
01:36:22 and how they're different from what I used to think.
01:36:23 Sounds reasonable to me.
01:36:26 You could like check your subscribers.
01:36:28 I'm 99% sure.
01:36:29 In fact, I say that looking at the feature
01:36:32 where I can do it right now.
01:36:33 And I'm just scrolling through,
01:36:35 like what if I just see someone who I just,
01:36:37 like I'll lose my shit on.
01:36:38 Like I don't think that's like impossible right now.
01:36:41 You can sort by most popular.
01:36:43 You can sort by the most subs.
01:36:45 Most subscribers, yeah.
01:36:46 So you can just see who is your most subbed person
01:36:50 who subs you.
01:36:51 You can't do that on Twitter though, I wish you could.
01:36:53 There are, I think apps you can use to do that though.
01:36:56 I haven't looked for apps
01:36:57 and I haven't found any that are free.
01:36:59 Okay, maybe I'm wrong.
01:37:00 I can only find in the past 28 days here
01:37:03 on YouTube right now.
01:37:05 I'll try and find, okay.
01:37:07 Oh, that's the new fucking creator studio thing.
01:37:09 They're probably removing that fucking functionality
01:37:11 like everything else with this.
01:37:13 Did you guys, okay, time for a call out.
01:37:14 Once again, do you guys watch Creator Insider?
01:37:19 They're like the quote unquote unofficial YouTube team
01:37:23 like update shit.
01:37:25 Everyone who does YouTube should watch them
01:37:27 because they just release information
01:37:29 that you're not gonna get anywhere else
01:37:31 about like literally what YouTube is doing.
01:37:33 It's the thing that we all wanted for years
01:37:35 about like, why doesn't YouTube just make a YouTube channel
01:37:37 and make announcements about their changes?
01:37:39 Well, that's what they are.
01:37:39 That's exactly what they are.
01:37:41 And they're often shitty and terrible
01:37:42 and I hate everyone who works there
01:37:45 but they do in fact release good information to know
01:37:48 if you're gonna do YouTube shit.
01:37:51 And they have been, I wanna use the word shilling.
01:37:54 They've been shilling the YouTube studio beta
01:37:57 as opposed to like the studio classic.
01:37:59 And I know it's not their fault.
01:38:00 Like YouTube just decide they're gonna update the studio.
01:38:02 It's like the new thing.
01:38:04 And they're gonna get rid of the classic studio pretty soon.
01:38:07 And I am dreading that day
01:38:09 because I fucking hate the new YouTube studio.
01:38:12 So let me just give you one, here's one reason
01:38:14 why I hate the new YouTube studio.
01:38:16 Dude, did you bro subscribe to me?
01:38:17 What? Oh my God.
01:38:19 He's got 363,000 subs.
01:38:22 This won't even be a big deal for most people
01:38:24 but for me it's infuriating.
01:38:25 It's okay, every month when I'm going over my finances
01:38:28 and the PC piece finances, which I do every month,
01:38:31 there is a thing that you can do
01:38:33 where you set up like exact dates of when you want
01:38:36 your like income earning to be for your analytics.
01:38:38 This is easy to do.
01:38:39 You click the little calendar.
01:38:40 It works relatively well on the studio beta
01:38:44 and the classic, so that's fine.
01:38:45 You can find the window of like a month's earnings.
01:38:47 No problem, get the information you need.
01:38:49 The problem is on classic you have the option of
01:38:53 you can have that block of time that set number of days
01:38:56 you wanna get your analytics from.
01:38:58 You can then go to the top right,
01:39:00 click on your account, switch account,
01:39:01 and you can switch accounts.
01:39:03 And if you do it on classic,
01:39:04 it retains that date window when you switch between accounts.
01:39:08 I have a lot of YouTube accounts that I go into
01:39:10 for this stuff and great, done, easy.
01:39:13 On fucking studio beta,
01:39:15 it resets the goddamn time window,
01:39:18 so I have to manually set it again for every fucking time.
01:39:22 Now, the one advantage is they have slightly more options.
01:39:26 You can go into a menu and select like a previous month,
01:39:29 a little bit easier, but I still have to click
01:39:31 an extra fucking button that I didn't have to in classic.
01:39:34 For that reason alone, I hate the new one
01:39:37 and it's fucking annoying.
01:39:38 It just lacks features the other had and I was used to.
01:39:41 And I'm gonna cry and bitch about it forever.
01:39:44 And everyone who pushes the studio beta, fuck you.
01:39:47 You're a bad person.
01:39:48 This is my-
01:39:49 I mean, it makes you look at better,
01:39:50 but right now the beta leaves a lot to be desired.
01:39:54 Yes, exactly.
01:39:55 I'm gonna fucking rabbit hole right now.
01:39:57 Okay, so I went to our subscribers
01:39:59 and I'm looking at everyone's sword by most popular.
01:40:01 On the PCP, I assume.
01:40:03 Yeah, of course.
01:40:04 A shocking revelation.
01:40:06 Drumroll, please, for the top subscriber
01:40:09 that we have to the PCP.
01:40:11 Drumroll, please.
01:40:13 Digi bro.
01:40:17 We did it.
01:40:18 But also, okay, among these,
01:40:20 among these are, again, just like someone that I know,
01:40:23 I already know who you are and you're watching the PCP.
01:40:25 What the fuck?
01:40:27 Deadly Comics is described to the PCP.
01:40:30 Deadly Comics was great.
01:40:32 What, huh?
01:40:33 What do you mean what?
01:40:34 That's pretty cool.
01:40:35 He's my best friend.
01:40:37 I love Deadly Comics.
01:40:38 He's a subscriber of mine as well.
01:40:40 We see him around, I think.
01:40:41 I remember this boxing video from years ago.
01:40:44 I can't even believe that it's real.
01:40:47 The person makes this-
01:40:48 Do you remember, do you-
01:40:48 Real?
01:40:49 What?
01:40:50 Do you remember he animated the give-and-take
01:40:52 jumping up and down?
01:40:53 Yeah, that was him that I put in my fucking video on.
01:40:56 Yeah, that's because he was a subscriber
01:40:57 of like give-and-take reviews or whatever.
01:41:00 He's had a lot of really funny innovation work
01:41:02 since then.
01:41:03 If you guys don't keep up with him,
01:41:04 it's fucking fantastic.
01:41:06 No, yeah.
01:41:07 What, guys?
01:41:09 What?
01:41:10 What's happening?
01:41:12 I don't understand.
01:41:13 Why are these people subscribed to the PCP?
01:41:15 The dick show's subscribed to the PCP?
01:41:17 What's happening?
01:41:19 Hey, what do you know?
01:41:20 That's, I mean, obviously that's,
01:41:22 those guys, they don't know much about us or care.
01:41:24 They obviously just subbed for the,
01:41:26 for the, you know, lecture did you did.
01:41:28 For the piece, don't say that, dude.
01:41:30 The fucking, the collabs and the works.
01:41:32 Yeah, okay.
01:41:32 All right, we'll see.
01:41:33 Damn.
01:41:34 And people like Fly Away Now are like,
01:41:36 like people who I care intensely about,
01:41:38 but like don't have like, you know, subscribers.
01:41:39 I can just go through here and find,
01:41:41 okay, like text talks.
01:41:42 I already knew that he was a fan,
01:41:43 but like, I didn't know he was a fan.
01:41:45 That would have been crazy.
01:41:47 Yeah, I'm looking at Deadly Comics' newest video, Milk Dust.
01:41:50 Ooh, I love it.
01:41:50 Got bite effects.
01:41:51 Looks sick.
01:41:52 Deadly Comics is good.
01:41:53 Pass analysis.
01:41:54 Glorious, glorious.
01:41:55 Yep, we got him.
01:41:56 Got him.
01:41:58 Frankly, there's not a lot of accolades on the PCP.
01:42:00 There's some, for sure.
01:42:01 And that's cool.
01:42:03 Okay, the fucking like exponential like drop
01:42:06 and like, oh, you know, you got Digibro at the top
01:42:08 with like almost 400K.
01:42:10 And then like almost immediately, it's like,
01:42:14 oh, that's like 1.0.
01:42:14 It was down to zero.
01:42:15 Yeah.
01:42:16 I mean, you know, for understand me.
01:42:17 That's fine.
01:42:18 I mean, it's not like, you know.
01:42:19 I mean, how many.
01:42:20 You're not less valve of a PCP fan.
01:42:21 Yeah, most subscribers.
01:42:22 The YouTube population has Digibro level subscribers.
01:42:24 Yeah, not much.
01:42:25 The most, the most curious one of mine
01:42:28 is like the most subscribed is a channel
01:42:30 called Reckless Eating with 600,000 subscribers.
01:42:35 They are like, yeah, Jesse like did like the Count
01:42:40 Chocula review like a million years ago.
01:42:42 And somehow through some like association through Jesse,
01:42:48 he found Hippocrite and he subscribed.
01:42:50 And he, I think has commented on a few videos.
01:42:53 It's just sort of like, man, I don't know anything
01:42:55 about that.
01:42:56 Anime guy said to me, go fuck off, dude.
01:42:58 I don't give a shit about your terrible anime.
01:43:01 All right.
01:43:01 Now I'm just, I'm just, you're a fallatio at this point.
01:43:04 I'm on my own and apparently Mr. Meat Man's following me.
01:43:07 Okay.
01:43:08 All right.
01:43:09 Okay.
01:43:10 Oh, he wants to dig up that scoop, dude.
01:43:11 He wants to beat.
01:43:11 Yeah, he really.
01:43:12 He thought that was monkey.
01:43:13 To be fair, Frank, he thought you were.
01:43:15 Yeah, that's right.
01:43:16 You know, unironically, Mr. Meat Man, I think was like
01:43:19 kind of a fan of at least some of us for a while.
01:43:22 And I don't know, he probably still is.
01:43:23 I mean, there's nothing's changed about what any of us do.
01:43:26 So, I mean, I just, I think he generally likes my content
01:43:31 as far as I know.
01:43:31 I don't know.
01:43:32 You know, I'm trying to put words in his mouth.
01:43:34 You know, you want to be fun.
01:43:35 You want to be fun.
01:43:36 Yeah.
01:43:37 Even if you're not, you know, like a fucking,
01:43:39 like a big wig, big dick.
01:43:41 Yeah, I am.
01:43:42 You know what?
01:43:42 If you're listening to us, just post a comment.
01:43:44 Post a comment.
01:43:45 I don't know what you do.
01:43:46 What your deal is.
01:43:48 I don't know.
01:43:49 Maybe I do know you from somewhere.
01:43:51 If you have vast amounts of social currency,
01:43:53 please post in the comments below
01:43:55 so that we may, we may basket it's glow.
01:43:58 I would love that.
01:43:59 I would absolutely, you know, that'd be delectable.
01:44:01 If I can, if I can Viva Reverie as well.
01:44:03 That's a cool guy.
01:44:04 I'm a two.
01:44:05 Oh yeah, he's a cool guy.
01:44:06 I remember those pony things.
01:44:06 Yep, yep, yep.
01:44:07 Wasted his talents on ponies,
01:44:09 but you know, one day maybe he'll wake up to, to justice.
01:44:13 There's a bizarre amount of subscribers to me
01:44:15 that have Scott Pilgrim avatars,
01:44:16 which I'm completely fine with.
01:44:17 Oh, that's concerning.
01:44:18 That's nice.
01:44:19 No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
01:44:21 That's the audience you want to be reaching.
01:44:22 Yeah, literally.
01:44:24 The Scott Pilgrim audience.
01:44:25 Um, okay.
01:44:27 So enough jacking our own.
01:44:28 Yeah, sure.
01:44:29 About how cool our subscribers are.
01:44:30 Sure, sure.
01:44:31 Um, let me, you guys catch those
01:44:33 fucking Democratic debates on the television.
01:44:36 I didn't know, television.
01:44:37 You know, I wanted to,
01:44:39 I wanted to look back,
01:44:40 but I, all I could find on YouTube was like reaction videos
01:44:43 and I couldn't find the actual thing.
01:44:44 I watched them both on YouTube.
01:44:45 I found clips.
01:44:46 The whole thing.
01:44:47 No, I mean, like afterwards,
01:44:48 I wasn't watching them.
01:44:49 Me too, I watched them afterwards.
01:44:50 I was like, I was gonna.
01:44:50 I'm gay.
01:44:51 Oh, well, whatever.
01:44:53 You know, I'm fine.
01:44:54 I really thought long and hard about watching those.
01:44:56 My conclusion was,
01:44:57 and this just goes to my general thoughts on life these days,
01:45:00 it's that I don't want to engage with politics
01:45:06 on this kind of like fast,
01:45:08 like kind of like the hype cycle level.
01:45:11 I would be much happier letting everybody else sort it out
01:45:13 and then I will try to sort through.
01:45:15 And you know what?
01:45:16 Maybe I'm lazy.
01:45:17 Maybe I'm avoiding the question,
01:45:18 but I think it's the best thing for me.
01:45:19 I watched them for the exact opposite reason.
01:45:21 I watched them because I didn't want to have
01:45:23 the information of the debate to be filtered through
01:45:26 biased perspectives from other people.
01:45:28 I wanted to observe it first hand
01:45:29 and draw my own conclusions.
01:45:31 I mean, I'd rather watch them all like in six months,
01:45:33 but I'm not going to obviously.
01:45:35 Nate, I understand what you mean by that.
01:45:38 But here's my counter thing.
01:45:40 I kind of felt the same way in 2016.
01:45:43 And in 2016, I wasn't really paying attention.
01:45:45 And I was just like, eh, doesn't matter.
01:45:47 I'll just wait for the final election.
01:45:50 I'll look at the final candidates.
01:45:51 I'll pick between them.
01:45:52 You know, I was like, you know,
01:45:55 everything up until that is the, it's, it's all just,
01:45:57 you know, there's nothing I can do about it.
01:45:59 And then because I had that attitude, I didn't,
01:46:02 I wasn't paying attention in the democratic primaries.
01:46:05 Yeah, yeah.
01:46:06 And I created and I fit the greatest moral failing
01:46:08 of my entire life, which was not voting for Bernie
01:46:11 in the primaries because I didn't vote in the primaries
01:46:13 because I wasn't paying attention.
01:46:15 So this time I was like, well, I'm going to be,
01:46:17 I got to at least pay some attention.
01:46:20 I got to at least pay some attention to like, you know,
01:46:22 the main fucking event of the race, which is, you know,
01:46:26 the debates.
01:46:26 So I tuned in.
01:46:27 That's fair.
01:46:28 I'd highly encourage people to arm themselves
01:46:31 with information and to vote in their primaries,
01:46:33 including me.
01:46:34 I should do that too.
01:46:35 If I, I don't even know if I'm registered to a party.
01:46:37 I certainly don't feel like I belong to either party
01:46:40 or any of the myriad parties out there.
01:46:42 But people should.
01:46:43 I don't know how it is in Cincinnati.
01:46:45 Pretty sure in Massachusetts.
01:46:46 I think I'm registered as an independent in Massachusetts,
01:46:48 but I think in Massachusetts,
01:46:49 independents are allowed to vote in either.
01:46:52 People should know those sorts of things.
01:46:53 Yeah.
01:46:54 I should make absolutely sure of that.
01:46:56 But you know, I, I was actually talking about this
01:46:59 in my stream yesterday a little bit,
01:47:00 that I do consider it a civic duty to vote.
01:47:03 And I think like you cannot do it in the same way
01:47:06 that you cannot, I don't know,
01:47:08 like doing anything that you should do,
01:47:09 but like that's, that's worse than doing it,
01:47:12 which I count with myself.
01:47:14 Which so I voted in the last bunch of elections,
01:47:16 but not the primaries.
01:47:17 And the primaries kind of matter more.
01:47:19 The only thing is-
01:47:20 I mean, you know, I mean, yeah,
01:47:21 I didn't think about it until 2016,
01:47:23 when the primaries-
01:47:24 2016 opened my eyes.
01:47:25 Yeah.
01:47:26 Yeah, yeah.
01:47:27 The 2016, the primaries decided everything.
01:47:29 It was so clear.
01:47:30 I mean, our two votes obviously, you know,
01:47:33 wouldn't have made a big, I wanted to vote for Bernie.
01:47:34 I was fucked up that Bernie didn't win, you know, last time.
01:47:38 I wouldn't vote for him now, but-
01:47:39 In hindsight, you wouldn't wait.
01:47:40 What do you mean you wouldn't vote for him now?
01:47:42 I mean, I, I mean, I don't know.
01:47:44 I probably vote for Trump.
01:47:45 So I was going to vote for anybody.
01:47:47 Because things are going fine.
01:47:49 I don't know, pretty happy.
01:47:50 Are you insane?
01:47:51 No.
01:47:52 Oh no.
01:47:53 Are you fucking kidding me?
01:47:53 Not at all.
01:47:54 Did you actually say that?
01:47:56 Oh my God, you're so down the rabbit hole.
01:47:59 Well, I'm down the, I'm down the rabbit hole.
01:48:02 I'm gonna fucking-
01:48:03 Well, I totally admit to my total ignorance.
01:48:05 I have no, not even if I not looked into it,
01:48:08 I have no interest in looking into like real life politics.
01:48:12 And so, I mean, I'll vote,
01:48:14 I'll figure out somebody to vote.
01:48:15 And I'll probably do what I've done.
01:48:16 And basically cop out,
01:48:18 and just vote for like a third party person
01:48:20 who isn't gonna win anyway.
01:48:21 Which, you know, I mean, it is my right to do, obviously.
01:48:24 Is this a bit?
01:48:25 No.
01:48:26 No.
01:48:28 You know, most of the country just, you know,
01:48:33 is pretty right-wing.
01:48:34 I mean, you know, about half.
01:48:36 I'm not even right-wing.
01:48:37 It's just that I don't really,
01:48:39 I mean, I want small government overall.
01:48:41 Clearly is like,
01:48:43 clearly is like a really stupid,
01:48:46 like silly man who says the wrong things on TV.
01:48:49 And it's really funny when he does that.
01:48:51 I assume you're one of those people who likes to ignore
01:48:54 like the Twitter drama stuff.
01:48:57 True.
01:48:57 And you care more about policy.
01:48:59 Do you even know what Trump has been doing, though?
01:49:01 I know a couple of things.
01:49:02 I mean, I don't either,
01:49:03 but like, I wouldn't immediately say,
01:49:06 yeah, sure, Trump.
01:49:07 Well, okay, let me be more specific.
01:49:10 What I'm really saying is,
01:49:11 because frankly speaking,
01:49:13 I'm almost definitely not going to vote for Trump.
01:49:15 I mean, you know, so let's not overreact here.
01:49:18 Nate's the biggest Trump supporter in the world.
01:49:20 He loves everything Trump is doing.
01:49:21 My point is that it doesn't seem to me very likely
01:49:25 that anyone's going to beat Trump.
01:49:27 So considering that, I'm, I don't know,
01:49:30 I'm relatively ambivalent about who I vote for anyway.
01:49:33 I mean, look, I understand people
01:49:35 are probably gonna disagree with that.
01:49:36 Why is that a reason to vote for him?
01:49:38 And second of all, I mean, I don't think that's,
01:49:41 he might win.
01:49:42 I don't think it's a sure thing.
01:49:43 I mean, to break it down, I'm in Ohio.
01:49:45 Ohio's gonna go red.
01:49:46 So I mean, you know.
01:49:48 Well, how do you know?
01:49:49 Well, it went red last time
01:49:51 and it seems like it's been trending that way.
01:49:53 I haven't really studied it or anything.
01:49:55 I understand that you don't really care,
01:49:57 but like, it seems like a pretty silly like position
01:50:00 to be like, well, it was this once,
01:50:02 it'll probably be this again.
01:50:03 Therefore, I won't even think about it.
01:50:05 You should vote.
01:50:06 You say that voting is a civic duty, but correct.
01:50:08 I honestly think people with your attitude
01:50:10 probably just shouldn't vote because that's fucking dumb.
01:50:12 I mean, I agree.
01:50:13 Well, okay, you're asking me right now
01:50:14 before I had a chance to, you know, look in anything.
01:50:17 So I don't know.
01:50:18 Let's readdress this question
01:50:20 when the primaries are coming up
01:50:21 or when the elections are coming up.
01:50:22 I really wish that you had seen the debates
01:50:25 because I really would love to hear your thoughts
01:50:27 on all the shit.
01:50:29 There was a lot of shit.
01:50:29 Not that I think they were great or anything.
01:50:31 In fact, they were kind of disappointing.
01:50:32 This will be more important
01:50:34 than anything I just said about who I'm gonna vote for.
01:50:37 The real deal here with me as a person
01:50:39 is I want the government to be so small
01:50:43 that I don't have to think about it at all.
01:50:45 So the question to me of who are you gonna vote for
01:50:49 is it's about who will fuck things up the least.
01:50:53 And additionally, who will do the less
01:50:56 to increase the size of government
01:50:58 because I just don't want it to be big.
01:51:00 So I understand.
01:51:01 People who want the government to fix things,
01:51:03 understandable, that's fair.
01:51:05 I just don't think that's happening.
01:51:08 And again, I'm not a student of political philosophy.
01:51:10 I don't know anything.
01:51:11 These are general thoughts of experience of life
01:51:13 that could be totally wrong.
01:51:15 It's just that considering that,
01:51:18 the question to me of who to vote for
01:51:20 is not a very important one
01:51:22 other than who will not fuck up the world more.
01:51:25 I'd rather that opposite of that happen.
01:51:28 So reasonable to think about.
01:51:30 I understand the president has influence on the world.
01:51:34 Who can I vote for to diminish that power?
01:51:37 That's the person I wanna vote for.
01:51:38 Cause I just wanna do my own shit
01:51:39 and not be bothered by anyone.
01:51:41 Cause that's it.
01:51:44 I mean, I wanna kind of wanna vote for Bernie
01:51:47 because he'll diminish corporate power
01:51:49 because that's like kind of the more pressing problem
01:51:52 in my life, right?
01:51:53 Economically speaking, that's what I'm into.
01:51:57 I get that.
01:51:57 What's going on with Yang?
01:51:58 I heard that his mic was like cut.
01:52:00 Yang got cut, man.
01:52:01 Yang got cut.
01:52:03 Okay.
01:52:04 He didn't speak up.
01:52:04 I'm not saying it's his fault, but yeah.
01:52:06 They only asked him like one or two questions.
01:52:09 He got snubbed and also apparently
01:52:12 his mic was turned off when he tried to interject.
01:52:14 There's video evidence showing that his mic
01:52:16 did get was turned off.
01:52:18 Okay.
01:52:19 So they fucking, yeah.
01:52:21 They fucking forest-gumped him.
01:52:23 Remember that?
01:52:24 Oh yeah.
01:52:25 When they cut the mic.
01:52:26 Yeah.
01:52:27 Okay, I'm with you.
01:52:28 I'm with you.
01:52:28 So that happened to him.
01:52:29 So he's being silenced, which is great.
01:52:33 You know, I love it.
01:52:37 God, no.
01:52:38 Hell, okay.
01:52:39 You know, I did watch just of passing interest.
01:52:43 I watched a couple of people's summaries of the debate
01:52:46 and it was interesting to see.
01:52:47 I watched, I think I watched Ben Shapiro on the one hand
01:52:51 say that Bernie lost hard.
01:52:53 And then on the other hand,
01:52:55 I watched Kyle Kalinsky of Secular Talk say that Bernie won.
01:52:59 Not as much as Kamala Harris, but that Bernie came out
01:53:02 and I'm just like, well, this just seems like
01:53:04 people's biases are playing a new one.
01:53:06 Well, Ben Shapiro is a fucking goblin.
01:53:08 So like, I think he's obviously wrong.
01:53:11 And I would assume that about anything he says.
01:53:13 I mean, what a boring point.
01:53:15 Cause now we, okay.
01:53:16 People whose political politics are different from mine.
01:53:19 Their opinion just doesn't matter.
01:53:20 Well, there's people who are different
01:53:22 and there's people who are stupid.
01:53:24 The only things I've heard Ben Shapiro say are,
01:53:26 man, I couldn't understand him.
01:53:29 Okay.
01:53:30 I don't think Bernie was like a huge,
01:53:32 I don't think he, yeah, like it's pretty clear
01:53:35 that the general consensus that the people that came out
01:53:37 that the most ahead in the debates were Tulsi Gabbard
01:53:39 in the first one and Kamala Harris in the second one.
01:53:42 That's fine.
01:53:43 I was just, I was waiting for Biden to embarrass himself,
01:53:47 which he kind of did, but not as much as I hoped he would.
01:53:49 Here Kamala dunked on him or something.
01:53:51 Kamala dunked on him really hard.
01:53:53 And then there was another part where I'm, oh God,
01:53:56 fucking the guy who looks like the fucking Dweebie guy
01:53:59 from 30 Rock, I don't know his name.
01:54:02 Like a younger candidate who looked like a fucking nerd,
01:54:05 but he was all right.
01:54:06 He came out, he was like, 30 years ago,
01:54:09 a politician came to my town or something.
01:54:12 Fuck, I forgot the details.
01:54:13 I heard a politician speak and he said it was time
01:54:16 to pass the torch to the next generation.
01:54:19 That politician was Joe Biden.
01:54:22 And Joe Biden fucking smirks at the camera and is like,
01:54:25 well, I'm gonna hold onto that torch a little longer.
01:54:29 He literally said that.
01:54:30 You'll pry this torch for my cold dead hands.
01:54:32 He didn't say that.
01:54:34 He did not literally say that.
01:54:37 That was pretty funny.
01:54:39 The best part of both debates was when fucking,
01:54:43 Hick and Looper, that fucking ghoul was like,
01:54:47 I think we need to not,
01:54:51 we need to make it really clear that we're not socialists
01:54:56 because if we're socialists,
01:54:58 then the Republicans will call us socialists,
01:55:02 and that's bad.
01:55:03 I mean, that will happen, true, as they already do.
01:55:06 Yeah, it already happens.
01:55:08 I mean, he's so fucking behind.
01:55:10 I thought Bernie's literally running
01:55:12 as a democratic socialist.
01:55:13 He is openly a socialist.
01:55:15 And you're like, we can't let them call us socialists.
01:55:17 Bernie fucking is one.
01:55:18 Hasn't Bernie been rejecting the label of socialist?
01:55:21 Like, I know he's a democratic socialist.
01:55:22 He's like, no, no, no, that's not socialism, guys.
01:55:24 This is a totally different thing.
01:55:26 Isn't that his stance?
01:55:27 I mean, think about it, though, Ben.
01:55:29 The whole reason Bernie got fucking snubbed last time
01:55:31 by his own party is because he was basically pushing
01:55:34 the socialist agenda that the people
01:55:36 power the DNC did agree with.
01:55:37 Yo, I'll throw this out here, though, Ben,
01:55:38 because it's interesting to hear your thoughts on it.
01:55:42 Like, okay, you're into the left stuff.
01:55:44 Got it, that's cool.
01:55:45 Is America overall with you on this?
01:55:49 I mean, are they gonna win?
01:55:50 No, Nate.
01:55:51 No. Okay.
01:55:53 Well, I think Bernie could win.
01:55:56 Okay, that's possible.
01:55:58 I don't know America's not on board
01:56:00 because the Overture window has shifted
01:56:02 and what's considered centric now
01:56:05 is fundamentally conservative.
01:56:07 Okay.
01:56:08 So no.
01:56:11 We're the opposition, but that's fine
01:56:15 because the actual things on offer by people like Bernie
01:56:18 are things that people actually care about and want.
01:56:22 For example, student loan, debt forgiveness,
01:56:26 universal health care, et cetera, such and such.
01:56:31 So yeah, no.
01:56:33 I think it is probably against,
01:56:35 but why do you ask that, Nate?
01:56:37 What's the point of that fucking question?
01:56:39 Well, my question, it's really, it's that like...
01:56:41 What's the actionable results of knowing that answer?
01:56:44 It's that like, I mean, based on the people
01:56:47 that I've been listening to,
01:56:48 it's been put out there that like,
01:56:51 so the left, like the democratic debates
01:56:54 are really far left in what most people are into
01:56:58 and like, that's fine.
01:56:59 That's their values or whatnot,
01:57:01 but like in a general election,
01:57:03 won't they be like too far left overall to win back?
01:57:06 Like, you know, the actual general election
01:57:08 from somebody like Trump,
01:57:10 who's obviously gonna be the other side.
01:57:11 I mean, I know that the far left people hate Trump,
01:57:14 but like, is this a winnable plan to just keep going left?
01:57:18 And the idea of even staying at all centers
01:57:20 seems to be so demonized,
01:57:22 but isn't that like literally the way
01:57:23 you appeal to more people?
01:57:24 What you're saying, what you were saying is...
01:57:28 I'm an idiot of politics, by the way.
01:57:29 I know nothing.
01:57:30 For the left, okay, okay.
01:57:31 Well, you know, you're not the only person to say this,
01:57:33 but it's very frustrating
01:57:34 because basically what you're saying is,
01:57:36 okay, if the left wants to win,
01:57:38 if the right, if the left wants to do what it wants to do,
01:57:41 it needs to concede and appease
01:57:45 and give as much ground to the right as possible.
01:57:48 I mean, negotiate, right?
01:57:49 And that's, right, that's what Democrats do.
01:57:51 They compromise, but we've compromised too much.
01:57:54 And the result of that is like,
01:57:58 centrist neoliberal shills like Hillary getting supported,
01:58:02 like Biden, who will change nothing, accomplish nothing.
01:58:07 Will they be better than Trump?
01:58:08 Yeah, sure, but like, they won't do anything.
01:58:12 And what we need is a fucking someone, you know,
01:58:15 Bernie, for example, someone who's actually got,
01:58:18 who wants to like fundamentally change stuff.
01:58:20 Well, you know, Ben, I'm with you in the sense of like,
01:58:22 having the kind of stagnation that results from that
01:58:25 is probably good for no one
01:58:27 and that it might just be straight up better.
01:58:29 I'm a small government guy,
01:58:30 so I'm not into most of these ideas,
01:58:33 but like, but having them might actually be better
01:58:36 than having the kind of half measures
01:58:37 that seem to paralyze society somewhat.
01:58:41 So yeah, I mean, maybe, I don't fucking know.
01:58:45 I don't, I certainly don't like
01:58:46 when everything's all like compromised
01:58:48 and no one actually gets the actual plan.
01:58:51 Vote, vote, vote Biden.
01:58:52 Nothing will, nothing will fundamentally change.
01:58:55 You know, sick, love it.
01:58:58 That's a quote.
01:58:59 He said, like he said, nothing will fundamentally change.
01:59:01 You know, the, here's the problem with me and politics.
01:59:04 It's that I'm very happy with my life
01:59:07 and I don't need much to change such that
01:59:11 I am not incentivized per, call me a selfish asshole,
01:59:14 I guess, but I'm not incentivized to like look into
01:59:18 what can be done to improve other people's lives
01:59:21 because that will have no impact on my life.
01:59:23 And as a result.
01:59:26 That's one hell, that's one hell of a sound, right?
01:59:28 You just gave me a name.
01:59:29 I mean, what should I do?
01:59:30 I mean, you know, it's hard to discern
01:59:33 what like other people's lives being better
01:59:36 will do to affect your life.
01:59:37 Like you can assume it's just generally good,
01:59:39 but there's nothing like immediately,
01:59:42 you know, I understand that sentiment.
01:59:44 I mean, I feel that a lot.
01:59:46 Well, not specifically, but like,
01:59:49 there's just sort of, ah, jeez, you know,
01:59:52 I have to think about that.
01:59:57 I just think it would be nice if, you know,
02:00:01 we took care of our citizens.
02:00:03 I just don't want the government to do anything.
02:00:05 You know, you know, whatever.
02:00:06 Yeah, I, I like.
02:00:09 The problem for me is that the government has fucked up
02:00:11 some people's lives.
02:00:12 So it seems like it owes people something for that.
02:00:15 But once we're square, can we just call this thing off
02:00:17 and let, you know, things just run on their own?
02:00:20 It'll be fine.
02:00:21 We can't fucking call it off.
02:00:21 It won't be fine.
02:00:22 It's not fine.
02:00:24 Well, no, it's not fine right now.
02:00:25 Yeah, there's things that need to be made amended for.
02:00:27 I agree, corporate, there's tons of problems
02:00:30 with corporations.
02:00:31 Yeah, that's, that's fair, that's fair.
02:00:33 Seems like power's being consolidated.
02:00:35 It sure, it sure is Nate.
02:00:37 It sure is.
02:00:38 Do you see that fucking wealth chart that I tweeted?
02:00:41 It's, but, but the other issue is, I don't agree.
02:00:43 Did you see that fucking chart?
02:00:45 I did, I did.
02:00:46 I did.
02:00:46 Cool visual.
02:00:47 Okay.
02:00:48 I still stand by the belief that some people having
02:00:50 more money than others is not a moral crime.
02:00:55 You, well, you mean power is a zero sum game, Nate.
02:01:00 Okay, but this, this idea of power,
02:01:02 like at what point will a company be so rich,
02:01:04 it's allowed to just like take my house from under me
02:01:07 and kick me onto the street.
02:01:09 Cause if that's not going to happen,
02:01:10 then I don't care how much money they have.
02:01:13 But the, but the point is that the more they have,
02:01:17 the less everyone else have.
02:01:18 That's how power works.
02:01:19 Okay. Well, you're talking about power.
02:01:20 I'm talking about money.
02:01:21 Yeah. And money, and money is power.
02:01:24 Well, I mean, I'd be,
02:01:26 I think you're doing an unfair conflation here.
02:01:28 Like you're saying like,
02:01:29 I'm not conflating money is power.
02:01:31 Well, that, isn't that a conflation right there?
02:01:33 No, not when it's true.
02:01:35 Not when two things are the same.
02:01:37 I mean, I, but I just established why I don't agree
02:01:40 with that. So maybe I'm wrong, but I just don't agree.
02:01:42 Yeah. I mean, no amount of money will let someone
02:01:44 just like kill me.
02:01:46 So until that happens, you know,
02:01:48 I'm not really worried about it.
02:01:50 So money, so money is not power then.
02:01:52 Okay. Great. Point.
02:01:53 Money can definitely help them like do it in a way
02:01:57 that they don't get caught.
02:01:58 Like, okay.
02:01:59 So they like, they bribed like the town commission
02:02:01 such that like those people will, you know,
02:02:03 they'll sign some forms and
02:02:04 or they pay an assassin to do it sneaky,
02:02:06 tweak some things so that they can, you know, like
02:02:08 wheel their way in the system to like take my house
02:02:11 or something like that.
02:02:12 I mean, that's not, that's not a crazy thing to do.
02:02:14 Who gives a, who gives a shit about your house?
02:02:16 Is it money being power the entire point of lobbying?
02:02:19 Right? Like, isn't that the whole point?
02:02:21 It is.
02:02:22 I mean, yeah.
02:02:23 But the problem there is that they can lobby the government
02:02:27 to do things that I'd rather the government
02:02:29 couldn't do one way or another.
02:02:30 Just get out of our lives.
02:02:32 Like, like what?
02:02:34 I mean, like how about like a company dumping waste?
02:02:38 Well, you know, they'll, whatever the fuck it,
02:02:41 they'll use money and the lobby
02:02:43 to get like loose and environmental controls.
02:02:45 Okay.
02:02:46 So like that's the government like shifting their standards.
02:02:49 That's money being power, right there.
02:02:51 I mean, I don't know.
02:02:52 I'm no fucking expert, but just like, can't.
02:02:55 You don't have to be an expert.
02:02:56 This isn't complicated.
02:02:57 It's extremely complicated.
02:02:59 And the way that you reduce it as like my point
02:03:01 is obviously the right one.
02:03:02 Anyone who thinks differently,
02:03:04 obviously they're not making any sense at all.
02:03:06 When I say that money is power,
02:03:08 yeah, I think anyone that thinks differently obviously
02:03:11 just doesn't know what they're fucking talking about.
02:03:13 Well, like what do you think money is?
02:03:15 Like what do you think money is?
02:03:17 It's, you know, like, what's the word?
02:03:19 Like leverage to be able to get people to do stuff.
02:03:23 There you go.
02:03:24 But the thing is, yeah,
02:03:24 just have the power to say no
02:03:26 when people ask you to make a transaction.
02:03:28 I mean, I oppose the anyone being able to override
02:03:32 one's right to choose things,
02:03:34 because of my freedom.
02:03:35 But I don't think that just having money
02:03:38 to buy things that you want
02:03:39 when people agree to the exchange
02:03:41 is the beast that we need to contend with.
02:03:45 Well, it is, I'm sorry.
02:03:47 Well, I guess that's it.
02:03:49 Maybe I could just be the ignorant one here
02:03:51 and not know anything.
02:03:52 That's definitely possible.
02:03:54 But I don't know, this is what I think.
02:03:55 Sure is.
02:03:57 Okay, well, whatever.
02:03:59 I mean, what do you expect from me?
02:04:01 I'm not educated on this.
02:04:03 Is that better, better?
02:04:04 Question mark, question mark, question mark?
02:04:06 I think you probably could be a good person
02:04:08 if you put a little effort into it.
02:04:09 Well, see, here's my focus.
02:04:11 I mean, call me a bad person if you want.
02:04:13 My focus is on being personally the best person I can be,
02:04:17 building myself up so that I can do good for myself
02:04:20 and the people around me
02:04:21 and taking care of my immediate environment.
02:04:24 If you wanna call that a bad person,
02:04:26 that's your right, excuse me.
02:04:28 But I mean, I would call that just, you know,
02:04:30 doing the things that are more tangibly,
02:04:32 you're able to control in your life
02:04:33 to try to make the world a better place.
02:04:35 But you're not talking about stuff that just affects you.
02:04:39 Like, when you're talking about like society at large,
02:04:43 so like we've moved beyond that.
02:04:45 Like, yeah, I get it that you personally want to like,
02:04:49 I don't know, you know, have a house, you know, have money.
02:04:54 Like, I want those things too,
02:04:56 because I need those things,
02:04:58 because I need to want those things
02:05:00 because that's the society we live in.
02:05:02 Right? You need to want them?
02:05:03 What do you mean?
02:05:04 And I don't blame you for being like,
02:05:06 I don't want there to be societal upheaval.
02:05:08 I don't want there to be, you know, strife.
02:05:12 I don't want there to be, you know,
02:05:14 I don't wanna be taxed and, you know, be impoverished.
02:05:19 That's all fine, makes sense.
02:05:23 But then there's sit like, you know,
02:05:26 in the broader scope of things, really, oh, small government.
02:05:30 Well, small government means corporations run rampant, right?
02:05:34 The smaller the government gets,
02:05:36 the less checks we have on unrestrained capitalism,
02:05:39 which caused the 2008 fucking financial crisis
02:05:42 and subsequent recession.
02:05:43 Well, look, I'm saying small, not zero.
02:05:45 For example.
02:05:46 I don't think that anarchy is the solution.
02:05:48 I agree on that, but you know, I mean,
02:05:51 it seems to me that like a lot of what we're doing
02:05:53 is putting faulty, like the system itself
02:05:56 is putting faulty incentives into place.
02:05:58 And again, I have not studied this shit, but...
02:06:02 What's a faulty incentive?
02:06:03 What do you mean?
02:06:04 Well, I don't know, like all the regulation on drug testing.
02:06:08 I mean, I was just listening to something about how,
02:06:13 regulations like they make, I get it.
02:06:14 We don't wanna hurt people, sounds good, got it.
02:06:17 The problem is when this like stagnates the development
02:06:20 of new products and adds such overhead
02:06:22 that the drugs are so expensive.
02:06:24 I mean, this sounds like it's being counterproductive
02:06:26 at a certain point.
02:06:27 So what can we do?
02:06:28 That's not why the drugs are expensive.
02:06:30 The drugs are expensive
02:06:31 because fucking big pharma is a monopoly.
02:06:34 But there's multiple drug companies.
02:06:35 So how's that a monopoly?
02:06:38 Well, they have a, well, okay.
02:06:39 Well, they're a polyopoly, okay?
02:06:42 They're like, they might be multiple companies, right?
02:06:45 But the point is that they are rich.
02:06:46 They're a rich capitalist corporation.
02:06:48 They have all the money.
02:06:48 They lobby for policies that empower them.
02:06:51 They have all the hands in the situation, right?
02:06:55 It's not because like testing regulations are too strict.
02:06:59 That's not why drugs are expensive.
02:07:01 I mean, what I want.
02:07:02 It's because they have the power to lobby
02:07:04 for the ability to make them expensive.
02:07:05 Man, we want the same.
02:07:06 So they can make more money.
02:07:07 It's not the same thing.
02:07:08 We want more people.
02:07:09 I mean, I assume this is what you want.
02:07:11 More people to just be able to compete
02:07:13 on a fair playing field with these guys.
02:07:16 And I mean, I don't know what's involved
02:07:18 in like making a drug and doing any of the testing
02:07:22 or chemical production or whatever's involved with that.
02:07:25 But like, I just-
02:07:26 Life doesn't have to be a competition.
02:07:29 Society doesn't have to be a competition.
02:07:30 Oh, that's where I totally disagree.
02:07:31 At last, we're at the true disagreement between us.
02:07:34 This is where we totally disagree.
02:07:36 Life will always be a competition,
02:07:38 as far as I understand it.
02:07:40 And I think it's naive to believe otherwise.
02:07:43 The human desire is not infinite.
02:07:45 Just it's fundamental to human nature.
02:07:48 You would think, you would think that it's naive
02:07:50 to think that things could be good.
02:07:52 I mean, you're framing it that way.
02:07:53 I'm framing you as being unrealistic about human nature.
02:07:56 So who's right?
02:07:57 I guess everyone has their own view on that.
02:08:00 Okay.
02:08:01 I'm depressed.
02:08:02 Thanks for listening to T-Bap,
02:08:04 two best brothers bitch about politics,
02:08:07 the weekly podcast show here on The Procrastinators.
02:08:10 I didn't want to have to do this.
02:08:12 What can we do to not do this again?
02:08:14 I would love to do that.
02:08:15 You forced me.
02:08:16 I forced you, but being ignorant.
02:08:18 You always are one half of the conversation.
02:08:21 You're like, oh, but guys, politics,
02:08:23 like, oh, this is just terrible.
02:08:25 How could this possibly happen?
02:08:26 Munchy, put yourself in my shoes.
02:08:28 If at any point I say, look, Ben,
02:08:30 I don't want to talk about this.
02:08:32 I look like the asshole.
02:08:33 So what am I to do?
02:08:35 What am I to do?
02:08:36 Take the bullet for the benefit of the show.
02:08:37 I don't know whether you look like the asshole.
02:08:39 Just concede that I'm right instead of this whole,
02:08:42 well, here's what I think.
02:08:43 Oh, but I'm not an expert.
02:08:44 You don't think you can see to any of this.
02:08:45 Are you the expert, Ben?
02:08:47 Here's why I disagree with you,
02:08:49 even though I don't actually know anything about it.
02:08:51 We just found out that we disagree
02:08:52 on our fundamental approach.
02:08:53 I think I know more than you do honestly.
02:08:55 True, but we disagree on our fundamental approach.
02:08:58 I don't know what I'm talking about.
02:09:00 I think I'm doing that because I am humble,
02:09:02 whereas you are not.
02:09:03 But we totally disagree on our fundamental premise
02:09:07 of what human life even is.
02:09:09 How could we ever agree on politics,
02:09:11 knowing that that's different?
02:09:13 This is like a microcosm of the problem
02:09:15 with the country in general right now,
02:09:16 is that the two parties don't agree on anything.
02:09:18 They're operating on two fundamental different existences.
02:09:22 The very building blocks,
02:09:24 the foundation of society and life itself
02:09:27 is no longer agreed upon by 50% of the country.
02:09:30 Well, surely it's been this way before.
02:09:32 I don't think that life has to be built around competition,
02:09:36 but I'm not gonna argue too hard,
02:09:39 and I will say that if we're gonna have a competition,
02:09:42 yeah, I wish that it would be fair, but it's not.
02:09:46 Like the deck is stacked in favor of those who are currently winning.
02:09:49 Whoever's, okay, you say that,
02:09:51 but everything you say works to the contrary of that,
02:09:55 because the deck is stacked
02:09:57 in the favor of those who are currently winning.
02:09:59 And what someone who is like socialist might say is,
02:10:02 well, we should stack the deck the other way
02:10:05 because capitalism itself stacks the deck.
02:10:09 So we gotta unstack the deck because that's just fair, right?
02:10:13 Because that's fairness.
02:10:14 I mean, is it fair to take the inheritance of a guy from his parents?
02:10:18 And you say, yes, because he doesn't fucking deserve it.
02:10:23 I mean, the thing is, no one deserves anything.
02:10:27 Life just happens.
02:10:29 And I don't want things to be...
02:10:32 Life is fundamentally unfair, is my approach to it.
02:10:35 No one deserves anything from square one.
02:10:41 Like no one is born deserving anything,
02:10:43 but when you're born into a society,
02:10:46 you necessarily must participate in that society.
02:10:49 And that society is generating wealth,
02:10:52 like on the back of you and everyone else's labor
02:10:55 that could provide for everyone.
02:10:58 I don't think you deserve it just for being alive,
02:11:01 but for your participation in that society,
02:11:03 I think you deserve to be taken care of by that society
02:11:07 that could do that for you.
02:11:09 If the people who were in charge of it decided that's what they wanted to do.
02:11:12 I just don't think it's their obligation to do so.
02:11:14 I think everyone's got to carve out their own shit.
02:11:16 They made them, they didn't make that money by themselves,
02:11:20 but they get to keep it themselves.
02:11:23 Like they personally own it.
02:11:24 If you don't like the job, don't do the job.
02:11:26 You're not making it else.
02:11:27 It's not about that.
02:11:28 All right, like the idea of inheritance and stuff,
02:11:31 like if I had the choice to have grown up in a family with less money,
02:11:38 I would not choose it because why would I?
02:11:41 I understand that there's an inherent like,
02:11:45 I don't want to give up this thing that I have.
02:11:47 I don't want to live in a world where my children won't have the benefits
02:11:51 that I can carve out for myself in the world.
02:11:54 But if everything was fair and the difference between the very rich
02:12:01 and the very poor was a lot, it was a lot more equal.
02:12:06 Being in a poorer family would not even be that bad.
02:12:11 I think is what like the ideal is where even if you're not,
02:12:16 if you're not given like a huge inheritance or if you didn't grow,
02:12:19 you didn't get born into the the correct big wealthy family.
02:12:23 If you got born into like the average family,
02:12:25 the average family would still be, you know, way better than it currently is.
02:12:30 And therefore it would be fine to not have inheritance
02:12:33 because you'd still be OK average.
02:12:36 We don't need to take down the top to raise the bottom.
02:12:40 We should be raising the wealth floor.
02:12:42 We don't have to necessarily stifle the wealth ceiling
02:12:45 because if wealth become a lot of the things that we all use
02:12:51 in a capitalist system is like done in the pursuit of profit
02:12:54 and that is fucked up and bad and wrong because it can lead to a lot
02:12:57 of like terrible decisions that are like tunnel vision.
02:13:00 I mean, sometimes to that point, sure.
02:13:03 But like if if if you if you have a situation
02:13:10 where you no longer have any incentive to do anything,
02:13:13 like a lot of people are just not going to do things, you know,
02:13:16 it just it just doesn't seem to make sense to me.
02:13:20 And that's when the society becomes burdened by those people
02:13:23 and that is bad. That's not good.
02:13:26 The that's what I fear about it.
02:13:28 The video, the video that that chart that I tweeted came from,
02:13:31 like my edited version of the chart that showed like,
02:13:34 okay, in the video, that final column for the 1%
02:13:38 that is like a million times higher, like it doesn't show the whole high.
02:13:41 It like chops it up and makes like a block out of it.
02:13:43 Yeah, yeah.
02:13:43 And it's a little and it's a little less evocative, right?
02:13:46 So I edited it to show that it actually is how tall it actually is
02:13:49 on this bar graph.
02:13:50 And it's like it's like 10 times as high as even like the 90th percentile
02:13:56 or as the 99th, like the 100th percentile is like so much higher than even
02:14:01 like the spike is like hugely exponential.
02:14:04 But anyway, the point is like that video is a video on the wealth inequality
02:14:09 in America and they polled people about like, what do they think the wealth
02:14:15 like the wealth distribution looks like?
02:14:17 And people drew sort of like a sort of a graph that like, you know,
02:14:20 oh, there's it kind of levels down at the poor people.
02:14:23 And then, you know, it starts to rise up in the middle class.
02:14:25 And then at the rich, there's sort of like this, there's a big bump, right?
02:14:28 So like this is like this is like maybe they're like five or ten time,
02:14:33 you know, several times wealthier than the average like middle class,
02:14:36 like maybe five times well, whatever.
02:14:37 So there's a big bump.
02:14:38 And then they asked, what do you think the wealth disparity should look like?
02:14:42 And people drew another chart that was like, you know, more even didn't
02:14:47 like the poor people were started out higher up, right?
02:14:50 Even the poorest were not under the poverty line.
02:14:52 It went up a little bit in the middle class.
02:14:54 And then there was still a bump, but like a smaller bump, right?
02:14:56 So there was a difference there in the distribution.
02:14:58 And it turns out that the that was what people thought it was and
02:15:02 what people thought it should be.
02:15:04 And it turns out that the actual graph is as different from the reality as people
02:15:11 think the as people think the reality is from their ideal.
02:15:16 And then you see the three alongside themselves and like, you know,
02:15:19 but from the ideal that people described, and then the bump gets bigger in the
02:15:24 in what they think the reality is.
02:15:26 And then the actual real reality is just this huge fucking
02:15:29 asymptotical spike up towards infinity at the hundred percent.
02:15:33 And the point is that basically everyone thinks that wealth should be
02:15:39 more equitably distributed, like almost everybody thinks that.
02:15:43 And people think that without even knowing that most people don't even
02:15:46 realize the direness of how inequitably it is distributed.
02:15:51 Did you know that currently the wealth distribution in America is less
02:15:56 equitable than in the days of fucking like Carnegie and Rockefeller, right?
02:16:01 Like the fucking like post-industrial revolutions.
02:16:03 Seems reasonable.
02:16:04 Yeah, the days of the robber barons.
02:16:05 It is worse than that now.
02:16:07 It's a nightmare.
02:16:09 We're living in hell.
02:16:10 That's all makes sense.
02:16:12 It's perfectly reasonable.
02:16:13 But I just remain at the position of I don't think disparate disparate
02:16:17 disparate desperateness or whatever in wealth is equivalent.
02:16:21 Like I'm all for setting the rules that you finish that sentence.
02:16:24 What is it not equivalent?
02:16:25 It's not equivalent to a moral crime because let's set the rules so that
02:16:30 you can't spend money on things that are like bad for the world or whatever.
02:16:34 I'm all for that.
02:16:35 But to just like to take the money that's that is produced by them.
02:16:41 I mean, do I think that they necessarily deserve all of it?
02:16:44 I'm sure that's not true.
02:16:46 So let's identify the specific ways that ill gotten gains have been obtained.
02:16:50 And let's take that, I guess, as like a crime that's been committed.
02:16:54 I just have no interest in taking money from people who just who earned it
02:16:58 legitimately by playing the rules.
02:17:01 You just you just said they probably didn't earn it legitimately.
02:17:04 You know, I said that I'm sure.
02:17:05 Well, I'm not. Yeah.
02:17:06 OK, I'm sure I'm sure that there has been some money gained illegitimately.
02:17:10 But a lot of this would be on how you define illegitimately.
02:17:13 I have a sneaking suspicion.
02:17:14 Yes, we're not going to agree.
02:17:15 We're not going to agree on that.
02:17:17 So I'm not even going to have you not said you won that profit is theft
02:17:20 in the past, because I think that right there shows our profit.
02:17:24 Is exploitation. OK.
02:17:25 Well, well, not always, but a lot.
02:17:29 OK, look, let's leave that.
02:17:31 Let me just ask you this.
02:17:33 OK. In the days of the robber barons, right?
02:17:36 Fucking I don't my history is muddled.
02:17:38 But the point is like we had monopolies, we had robber barons,
02:17:42 we had like huge wealth and equality, fucking like Teddy Roosevelt or whatever.
02:17:46 You know, him and his brain trust, you know, past trust busting laws.
02:17:49 They busted up the trusts and such.
02:17:52 And and and, you know, they fucking do that now.
02:17:55 And we, you know, yeah, OK, we should do that now.
02:17:59 And, you know, the way that you do that is you have to have a power
02:18:05 that is more powerful than these big corporations that can enforce that.
02:18:09 And I know you love small government, in theory, I understand.
02:18:12 But the only power on earth that could possibly do that is the government, right?
02:18:17 And I agree. That's our only hope.
02:18:20 There are certain functions the government should do.
02:18:22 Yeah. Yeah, I agree. Or I mean, or a violent people's revolt.
02:18:26 I don't particularly want that, but that's another option.
02:18:29 It is an option. Here's the problem with the government, right?
02:18:31 Is that you the situation we're in right now that makes like corporate
02:18:36 like control, like being able to like fight back against the issues
02:18:41 you're talking about is that the government is a national power.
02:18:46 Corporations are worldwide.
02:18:48 So like we can make all the laws, put all the laws on the books that we want,
02:18:51 saying like, Oh, Amazon, fuck you, you're paying taxes now.
02:18:54 The loopholes are closed. We're breaking up Google, whatever.
02:18:58 Like the government can go in and try and make rules like that and make legislation.
02:19:02 Google and Amazon will just leave. We'll just leave the country.
02:19:05 They all they already operate internationally.
02:19:08 It's already that's exactly my point.
02:19:10 So like they have the resources clearly to to to to to get out of the
02:19:15 jurisdiction of the United States law.
02:19:17 So you would in order to actually solve this problem,
02:19:20 you would have to have a one world government.
02:19:22 And I know that's like the dream for a lot of people on the left.
02:19:25 They want to get rid of the nation state.
02:19:27 But that creates a lot of other problems.
02:19:29 And this is where I think Nate is right in saying that like,
02:19:31 this is an incredibly complicated issue because of the domino effect
02:19:34 of changing these things when you're dealing with powers this massive
02:19:38 and this able to get around what we feel like as normal people,
02:19:44 like ironclad law, right?
02:19:46 Like we are governed by US law.
02:19:49 Corporations, not so much.
02:19:50 They have the power and the ability to leave the United States entirely
02:19:54 and no longer be bound by national law.
02:19:57 And Amazon is a it's a United States based corporation.
02:20:01 Like if we said, you know, maybe Yang gets elected.
02:20:05 We're like, OK, value added tax.
02:20:06 There's a value added tax on Amazon's profits now.
02:20:10 That's there's no loopholes for that.
02:20:11 They have to pay it.
02:20:13 And and Bezos says, well, in that case, I'm just going to leave.
02:20:16 I mean, they can't just leave, right?
02:20:18 That would be like maybe not treason.
02:20:20 But it would be like that would be tax evasion and he would be
02:20:23 an international fugitive if he did that.
02:20:25 Don't I mean, I'm not an expert, but I don't know if that's the case.
02:20:29 I would assume if you're running a business, you can relocate it.
02:20:34 I mean, yeah, probably to pay.
02:20:35 I mean, I didn't Trump put something like a thing where you have to pay
02:20:38 if you're trying to leave your company from the US or something.
02:20:40 Sure, I'm sure that fine would be inconsequential compared to the damage
02:20:44 that that a radical restructuring of corporate law in the United States would entail.
02:20:50 So I think a lot of people would probably pay that fee and leave if that was the case.
02:20:54 Maybe. I mean, that's the same.
02:20:55 That's the same issue we're talking about with like Amazon's new headquarters
02:20:58 in New York was like a microcosm of what we're talking about, you know,
02:21:01 but states instead of country, honestly, you know, I don't think it would be as simple
02:21:06 as just oh, we impose a tax Amazon like like operating in the United States
02:21:11 is still beneficial.
02:21:12 Like, I don't think they would just up and leave.
02:21:15 Well, it's beneficial even if they did with this new laws in place.
02:21:20 Like someone's balancing the books.
02:21:22 And at some point, if we tip the scale too much, of course, they're going to pack up and take off.
02:21:26 But that that's just that's just appeasement.
02:21:29 That's just saying, let the fucking OK, I'm sorry for my sorry for my evocative language
02:21:34 that I'm sure people have a big problem with.
02:21:35 That's just saying to the to the tyrant, the like go OK,
02:21:40 we better just let you fucking have your way with us.
02:21:43 Better just let you exploit us as much as you want.
02:21:46 Because if we do anything about it, you'll you'll you'll you'll leave.
02:21:49 You know, you'll fuck us over like you'll take your bowl.
02:21:51 No, that's just not a tenable mode of operation.
02:21:55 OK, I mean, I mean, no, I want I want there to be a reform.
02:21:58 I get what you're saying.
02:22:00 I get what you're saying.
02:22:01 Probably it would be bad problem.
02:22:03 I mean, would well, here's the thing with the United States even lose anything
02:22:08 if Amazon fucked up because they don't even pay taxes.
02:22:11 So like fuck leave them.
02:22:13 Well, I don't think it's that simple.
02:22:15 Surely there's some, you know, benefit to the economy.
02:22:17 Here's like a simple question to this complex situation, right?
02:22:23 Would you be more in favor of like a potential
02:22:28 like domino effect catastrophe or like some some, you know, unforeseen bad consequences
02:22:34 but also change or would you prefer stagnation?
02:22:39 Um, like if there's a choice, like how much do you care?
02:22:42 And like would you care that there's a change
02:22:46 even if it may fuck things up?
02:22:48 I mean, I guess we're assuming that this is like what we would consider a good change.
02:22:53 Is this is this question for me specifically?
02:22:56 It's for anyone, like like that a lot of what these complicated complex things come down to is like
02:23:04 do you care enough about potentially damaging other things that you may not
02:23:11 be foreseeing to like upset the system?
02:23:15 Or are you scared too scared to do any of that or not scared?
02:23:21 But like you're too wary to change, you know, change anything for fear
02:23:25 or fucking up something unforeseen?
02:23:29 I mean, it depends.
02:23:31 Like, I mean, depends how bad we're talking.
02:23:36 You know, the point is that is that it's unforeseen and you're not sure exactly.
02:23:39 Nobody, unless you're like a super genius, you'd never be able to have all the information
02:23:42 and make the correct decision.
02:23:44 At the moment, I would say, yeah, we better fucking shake things up now
02:23:48 because things are bad and they're just getting worse.
02:23:51 So, yeah, I mean, I guess if you if you handed me the dice and said,
02:23:57 yeah, you feel unlucky, punk, yeah, I'd roll them.
02:24:00 I think now is a good time to roll them because because, you know,
02:24:03 the status quo is bad and getting better.
02:24:08 So, yes, I think I'd change, please.
02:24:12 Is the main bad thing that you're identifying change seems just more more.
02:24:18 I mean, I guess interesting, but that's not a good reason.
02:24:20 But like, sure, politics has been like the same old shit
02:24:25 my entire life.
02:24:26 I've never really noticed anything being like actually different.
02:24:31 Like, Trump is the most recent thing that was like, whoa, what do you know?
02:24:37 And yeah, it's very different.
02:24:38 I suppose that's not.
02:24:40 Brexit is also a thing.
02:24:41 I don't really want Brexit to happen.
02:24:43 I know it will be bad.
02:24:44 But one part of me is like, that's different.
02:24:47 I'd prefer different, honestly.
02:24:51 I mean, yeah, I would also prefer good.
02:24:56 Yeah.
02:24:57 For example, yeah, okay.
02:25:01 Well, cool.
02:25:03 Yeah, roll them.
02:25:04 Roll them bones.
02:25:07 Yeah, I mean, you know, I don't want a violent revolution, but if there was one
02:25:12 and the result was, you know, student loan, debt forgiveness, universal health care
02:25:18 at the cost of, I don't know, maybe some beheadings.
02:25:23 I just straight up think that's probably worth it.
02:25:25 I straight up think that's worth it because people because people actually die
02:25:28 under like lack of Medicare right now.
02:25:30 Revolutions don't go the way people say that they will fight.
02:25:34 I mean, yeah.
02:25:34 Oh, no, I'm posing.
02:25:36 I'm posing the hypothetical scenario of there is a violent uprising and the only
02:25:41 measurable consequences of that are student loan, debt forgiveness, universal health,
02:25:45 single payer health care.
02:25:47 Yeah, I would take that deal.
02:25:51 Okay, but I need to leave right now.
02:25:53 Highly specific.
02:25:55 Unfortunately, I need to leave right now.
02:25:57 I did not expect this podcast to go on for two hours and 35 minutes before voicemails.
02:26:03 Yeah, it's a long ass episode.
02:26:05 Oh, God.
02:26:07 Okay, yes, understandable.
02:26:10 Sorry, happy birthday, you fuck.
02:26:13 Yeah, oh, it's my birthday.
02:26:15 I don't know whether I mentioned that.
02:26:16 No, I don't think so.
02:26:17 Happy birthday, you jerk.
02:26:18 I'm 26, I'm like just a boring number.
02:26:24 It's the one year anniversary of you being able to rent a car without paying an additional
02:26:29 young driver's fee in the United States.
02:26:36 All right, see you later.
02:26:38 Later.
02:26:39 Should we just do the voicemails now?
02:26:42 Unless anyone's got any more to say about all of that.
02:26:47 We could go on for hours, honestly.
02:26:49 I gotta tell you, not only do I not have anything more to say right now,
02:26:53 it's that I'm so, I so wish we didn't do these things because everyone's so bored by them.
02:26:59 You sure argue pretty fervently for someone who has nothing to say about it.
02:27:04 It's not that I have nothing to say.
02:27:05 It's that I am so aware that no one wants to hear what I have to say.
02:27:09 That's what I'm sensing.
02:27:10 I think the, I would say that the audience is split.
02:27:13 T-Baboo politics literally went.
02:27:17 Literally went, Nate.
02:27:18 I gotta tell you, Ben, I just straight up don't,
02:27:21 I don't want that to exist is my main concern.
02:27:25 Just do it yourself, man.
02:27:26 Just get whoever you want.
02:27:27 That's just another, that's just one more,
02:27:30 that's one more fundamental difference in our worldviews that will probably never be reconciled
02:27:36 is the desire for two best brothers bitch about politics to exist.
02:27:39 I think you're right.
02:27:40 I think that is very true.
02:27:42 Uh, you know, I will say on the subject,
02:27:45 it's just that, I mean, maybe I'm just a coward and I'm too complacent,
02:27:50 but frankly, I just don't want to fuck up my life by discussing politics
02:27:55 and things I have no idea about and don't even have the interest to learn about.
02:27:59 Well, you've sure done a great job of doing exactly that.
02:28:03 Like, why do you, you'll fucking fight me on these things and then you'll be like,
02:28:07 oh, but I don't know what I'm talking about.
02:28:09 I just think, and then you'll fight some more about it.
02:28:11 I mean, everything I say, everything I say, I believe,
02:28:15 I just don't think anyone, like whatever, they care about my opinion.
02:28:19 They shouldn't though, because I'm uneducated.
02:28:21 This is just like my life assessments.
02:28:24 I have not studied any of this.
02:28:26 I listen to people who know more sometimes
02:28:28 and they think different than me.
02:28:30 Maybe they're right.
02:28:31 I don't know.
02:28:33 Why would my opinion has no value in politics?
02:28:35 So I'm just aware that I'm just wasting everybody's time with my discussion about it.
02:28:40 So I believe everything I say.
02:28:42 I just think that no one should care.
02:28:44 And I'm really not trying to make myself sound cool or anything like that.
02:28:49 It's just that I am ignorant and that's unfortunate.
02:28:52 I mean, I guess listen to Ben since he claims to know more.
02:28:56 I mean, take his word for it.
02:28:57 I wouldn't say I'm an expert, but I think I know some things
02:29:01 and they have led me to some pretty strong opinions about some things.
02:29:05 I want to say in the record that even though in the past
02:29:10 and even still now, I don't want to make it seem like I've been a real vocal opponent
02:29:16 to the idea of politics being presented.
02:29:18 Because frankly, I think that's pretty annoying.
02:29:21 Ben, if you remember the last PCP, when I just brought up something
02:29:24 that was tangentially related to politics, everyone started groaning in chat,
02:29:28 which I thought was pretty immature and lame and dumb.
02:29:32 Was I on that one?
02:29:33 Dude, can you blame them?
02:29:34 We've been inundating them with our politics talk for months now.
02:29:37 Of course.
02:29:38 You mean the audience started groaning?
02:29:40 Yeah.
02:29:40 Wait, who started groaning?
02:29:41 The audience?
02:29:42 Yeah.
02:29:42 Yeah, fuck them.
02:29:43 Fuck the audience.
02:29:45 I emphasize with that.
02:29:46 I understand.
02:29:47 But I do just want to say that Ben, you've actually been pretty good this time actually.
02:29:54 You were pretty eloquent.
02:29:57 Smart?
02:29:57 Yeah, you were.
02:29:57 Eloquent?
02:29:58 You were.
02:29:58 You know what?
02:29:59 I feel like in the past, I have sometimes not gotten my point across adequately.
02:30:04 I don't really feel like that this time.
02:30:06 At the very least, I feel like I said everything I needed to say
02:30:09 and made all the points I wanted to make.
02:30:10 I feel like you got into actual specifics and you actually argued your point.
02:30:17 You know, maybe early in this year, in the 2016, lead up to 2020 primaries,
02:30:25 I'm like, I don't want to repeat it last time.
02:30:27 I don't want to go down another year that I didn't vote in the primaries.
02:30:31 I started thinking about all this stuff and I started getting into it.
02:30:35 I feel like I have grown in my understanding quite a bit.
02:30:39 I started out with some vague notions of what I thought was right and probably just.
02:30:44 I've looked into it more and I have more facts and logic to own people with now.
02:30:50 I am a political history nerd.
02:30:53 I love the idea of orators and I love the ideas of intrigue and debate.
02:30:59 They're extremely romantic to me.
02:31:01 And I've always really highly valued them.
02:31:05 The reason why I would be annoyed with the PCP of Discussed Politics
02:31:09 is because it felt like people very vehemently like arguing things that they know nothing about
02:31:14 and that have went very little thought into them.
02:31:18 And so that's why I would get annoyed.
02:31:20 But I feel like, you know what, Ben, you at least understand what you're saying.
02:31:27 You have reasons to believe them and you know, I'm curious.
02:31:31 How much time do you guys devote to politics on RFCK?
02:31:36 Basically zero.
02:31:37 Why can't that be this?
02:31:39 Why can't that be here?
02:31:43 Why don't you put all your politics in RFCK?
02:31:46 That sounds great.
02:31:47 I have no wish to argue politics or to discuss them.
02:31:52 Nate, you are the half of this.
02:31:54 I don't understand what you don't understand about this.
02:31:56 You are the essential component that makes politics happen on the PCP.
02:32:01 This is like that moment at the end of Fight Club.
02:32:04 You're right.
02:32:04 I am the name of that.
02:32:07 I am Tyler Durden.
02:32:08 Tyler Durden.
02:32:09 I need to kill myself to remove me from the situation so this never ever happens again.
02:32:15 I think politics are intriguing.
02:32:17 I do not think they're an inherent evil.
02:32:19 I think they are oftentimes annoying on this show.
02:32:22 I think they're I think that politics are a big opiate for the masses
02:32:26 as a distraction from actually fixing their lives in meaningful ways.
02:32:30 This is how I view politics.
02:32:32 Yeah, that's right.
02:32:35 We can all jack our dicks about like, oh my god, this tax policy.
02:32:38 Meanwhile, you should go fucking, I don't know, pick up a second shift
02:32:41 so you can pay for your daughter's fucking college or something.
02:32:45 As if taxes don't affect what you're able to pay for.
02:32:47 Too bad you'll need to work 36 hours a day in order to actually do that
02:32:53 because the minimum wage is only like $10.
02:32:55 Why would you ever think that the minimum wage
02:32:57 should be what you should earn to support a family?
02:33:01 What?
02:33:01 That's like that's that's the entry level on baby level.
02:33:05 Some people some people don't have like degrees.
02:33:08 Well, that's you can get a good deep better job without a degree.
02:33:13 Well, okay, not everyone.
02:33:16 Some people are going to have to work minimum wage jobs, right?
02:33:19 Well, I they should work out of it eventually.
02:33:23 Not everyone can work out of it.
02:33:26 I mean, I'm sure that's true.
02:33:27 I'm sure that's true.
02:33:31 Well, I hope they live their life realistically then, I guess.
02:33:36 Yeah, fuck college.
02:33:38 I mean, I agree.
02:33:39 I'm colleges for people who are going to do something useful with it,
02:33:41 not just waste a bunch of money.
02:33:45 Well, sure.
02:33:48 Munchy, you're my best friend.
02:33:50 I mean, you know, I feel like you you earned it this time.
02:33:56 And you know what?
02:33:56 And you know what, Ben?
02:33:57 I want you to appreciate because I do not say that lightly.
02:34:01 Thank you.
02:34:02 Because I well, you know, you know, you annoy me all the time every day.
02:34:06 And you know what?
02:34:07 You didn't annoy me even a little bit this time.
02:34:09 The constant crunching of my unsalted cashews,
02:34:12 just just grinding of my teeth keeps you up at night.
02:34:15 I know, you know, I know people have complained about in the comments
02:34:18 like us talking about this and not knowing what we're talking about.
02:34:21 I'd like to think that those are, for me personally, those are growing pains
02:34:25 in which I was still trying to like hash out, you know, knowledge.
02:34:31 I'm getting there.
02:34:31 I don't think it's necessary.
02:34:33 I'm getting there.
02:34:34 I don't think it's necessary that everything you say align with my or everyone else's opinion.
02:34:40 I think the only thing that matters in debates like this are the fact that you are eloquent
02:34:45 and explain yourself in a reasonable sort of way.
02:34:48 You still are extremely vitriolic and angry and mean for no reason,
02:34:54 which is something to work on.
02:34:55 But you know what?
02:34:55 That's, that will work out.
02:34:58 Yes, yes.
02:34:59 Okay.
02:35:00 All right.
02:35:00 We don't have to thank you for patting me on the back, but let's let's end it.
02:35:04 Should we?
02:35:05 I don't know.
02:35:06 Anything else?
02:35:07 The voice, the voicemails are here.
02:35:09 And Nate, I believe you said that these are terrible.
02:35:11 So we do you want to do them?
02:35:14 No, no, well, well, I said that the, as I was going through them,
02:35:17 the, everyone be, please be advised.
02:35:19 The selection of voicemails was, was particularly bad this time.
02:35:22 There was like, you know, you know who you are.
02:35:25 If you left a voicemail, it was like kind of okay.
02:35:27 I'm not playing it for a reason.
02:35:30 So just be aware of that.
02:35:31 You know, I was, I was questioning myself.
02:35:34 I was thinking, am I like in a bad mood?
02:35:36 Is there something wrong with me that like I'm enjoying these less than normal?
02:35:40 I don't think so.
02:35:41 I think it's you, not me.
02:35:43 Humble, humble voicemail callers.
02:35:45 It's like that, it's like that meme of Skinner being like, hmm, is it,
02:35:50 could I be out of touch?
02:35:51 No, it's the voicemails.
02:35:53 The difference being in that the joke was that he was wrong about that,
02:35:56 but I'm right about this is my, is my confusion.
02:36:00 No, yeah, no, I'm sure the voicemails are terrible.
02:36:03 And listen, people, look, nobody, nothing was like offensively bad or terrible,
02:36:08 but like some people you went on way too long.
02:36:11 You, I don't know, I'm doing this for your benefit.
02:36:14 Speak, pipe, listener, people, so that you will get on.
02:36:17 It was too long and boring and didn't get to the point.
02:36:20 It was like overly personal and not in an interesting way.
02:36:24 And we have personal stuff on here that was entertaining.
02:36:26 So juxtapose this to your voicemail.
02:36:29 I don't know, like it just, just a lack of entertainment value was the main thing.
02:36:33 So I'm not trying to berate anybody.
02:36:35 I'm simply giving you feedback on why you didn't get in so that you can improve in
02:36:39 the future if you care to be on, of which you don't have to be, you owe us nothing.
02:36:42 So there you go.
02:36:44 That's, that's it.
02:36:45 Let's, let's go to the first one though, because like I have four that were, you know,
02:36:49 they were okay.
02:36:50 They were okay.
02:36:52 Let's, let's, you know what, this one sucked.
02:36:54 I'm skipping this one actually.
02:36:55 Let's go to the next one.
02:36:59 We're down to three.
02:37:00 I can't wait.
02:37:02 All right.
02:37:02 This is from a bus ride Tony.
02:37:05 Let's, let's hear what bus ride Tony has to say.
02:37:07 Oh, yes.
02:37:08 Okay.
02:37:08 Go.
02:37:09 I know that name.
02:37:10 Where do I do that?
02:37:10 Hello.
02:37:12 I am bus ride Tony.
02:37:15 Oh God.
02:37:15 And after 92 years, I'm finally a teenager.
02:37:21 That's right.
02:37:22 Today I turned 113 years old.
02:37:28 He's keep like disappeared.
02:37:30 That's how I know.
02:37:30 Finally, finally submit my application to join the teen CP.
02:37:37 Oh, of course.
02:37:40 If you need to contact me, I look like a man who is always waiting for the bus,
02:37:49 but there's never a bus stop near me.
02:37:52 Is that Victor Victor?
02:37:55 Goodbye.
02:37:56 I don't wait my summons.
02:37:58 Oh my God.
02:37:59 Shut up.
02:37:59 All right.
02:38:00 But bus.
02:38:01 Okay.
02:38:03 First of all, please don't stop.
02:38:05 But also why do, why does everyone call in to be on the teen CP on the teen CP?
02:38:11 It's the new meme, dude.
02:38:12 Because it's the wave of the future.
02:38:14 Well, okay.
02:38:14 Listen, the teen CP is objectively superior.
02:38:17 Hashtag where's the teen CP?
02:38:18 Maybe multiple are out already.
02:38:22 Check them on my channel.
02:38:23 I guess it's just another podcast.
02:38:24 So wait.
02:38:24 Nobody stops.
02:38:25 So they're on Munchy wears tiny hats on YouTube.
02:38:28 They're on your channel.
02:38:28 That's where they are.
02:38:30 Yes.
02:38:30 Well, I don't know why you're like, you're like, don't even focus on that one detail.
02:38:34 I actually did not know.
02:38:35 Right?
02:38:36 What?
02:38:36 I knew.
02:38:37 I knew they were out and I did not know where they are.
02:38:39 Okay.
02:38:40 Well, yeah, there are two episodes of the teen CP soon to be a third on my channel.
02:38:46 You can go watch them.
02:38:48 People really, really, really seem to resonate with them and are super excited about them,
02:38:52 which I'm super excited about as well.
02:38:54 It's pretty cool.
02:38:55 Well, the teen CP is a PCP meme, but it is its own show.
02:38:59 There's this.
02:39:00 Oh, yeah.
02:39:00 No, it's its own show for disgruntled PCP fans
02:39:04 who are also teens.
02:39:05 Indeed.
02:39:05 AKA me.
02:39:06 Such as our boy bus ride Tony or whatever the fuck his name was.
02:39:09 No, no, no.
02:39:09 He's not on.
02:39:10 He wants to be on.
02:39:11 What do you mean?
02:39:11 I mean, he's eligible.
02:39:13 Okay.
02:39:13 Well, what's your what's your policy on Centenarian teen, Centine areas?
02:39:20 Our policy is that we take everything on a case-by-case basis because we are Zoomers,
02:39:24 AKA maximum nuance and there is no objective reality.
02:39:28 So we will review him.
02:39:29 Odds are that we will say get fucked and you're gay though.
02:39:32 Okay.
02:39:33 I am.
02:39:34 I am, by the way, coining that term.
02:39:37 If you are a Centenarian is a person who is over 100 years old.
02:39:40 So if you are in your 110s, you are a Centine area.
02:39:44 That's good.
02:39:44 That is mine.
02:39:45 I get royalties for that every time.
02:39:46 There's a couple of those.
02:39:47 A couple of people have lived that long.
02:39:49 I think the oldest person ever was 130 something.
02:39:52 I don't know.
02:39:52 Whatever.
02:39:54 Yeah.
02:39:54 No, there you know, there's like research that suggests that like this is depressing,
02:39:59 but like like like like it's it's genetic.
02:40:03 Like whether you will live to be like super old is like pretty much just genetic.
02:40:06 Hmm.
02:40:07 Okay.
02:40:07 Like it runs in like it runs in families and stuff.
02:40:10 No, that's a good thing because we've mapped the human genome.
02:40:13 It's only a matter of time before you can genetically engineer immortality.
02:40:15 We're getting there.
02:40:16 We might.
02:40:17 Well, it's a good thing for the next generation, but it sucks for me.
02:40:19 Yeah, we're probably not going to make it.
02:40:20 Maybe we will.
02:40:21 No, fuck off.
02:40:21 We'll see.
02:40:22 I'm optimistic.
02:40:25 2027 is when Deus Ex brings in fucking robot bodies.
02:40:29 So like we're we're getting close.
02:40:31 We have seven more years.
02:40:31 That's fair.
02:40:32 That's fair.
02:40:33 I'm I'm not even like my whole thing.
02:40:35 I don't know if I said that this episode about how immortality.
02:40:37 I'm a little skeptical of it as a like as a viability for the human species,
02:40:42 but it's a totally different ball game.
02:40:44 If we've got like interstellar travel and like we've got colonies,
02:40:47 like if you can just go be immortal elsewhere, that's fine.
02:40:50 I'm worried about like clogging up earth with old people who should be dead,
02:40:53 but it was just myself.
02:40:54 You're immortal.
02:40:55 Khan, you're banished to the moon for eternity.
02:40:58 The moon's all right.
02:40:59 I take it.
02:41:00 It's not bad.
02:41:01 Well, as long as I can kill myself,
02:41:03 if I want to the moon, you know, the dumpster, I mean,
02:41:07 for all of eternity on the moon, that's not that bad.
02:41:09 If theoretically there would be stuff on the moon at some point,
02:41:12 dude, it'd be it'd be like playing Minecraft.
02:41:14 Exactly.
02:41:15 Yeah, that sounds good.
02:41:16 You could just you just make shit out of it.
02:41:18 All right.
02:41:18 Two more voicemails.
02:41:19 So we got two more fucking long.
02:41:21 I have a pizza.
02:41:21 I need to go to pizza.
02:41:22 This fucking pizza.
02:41:23 Okay.
02:41:23 All right.
02:41:24 This this mail is from LMAO Lamau.
02:41:27 Let's see what Lamau has for us.
02:41:29 Go.
02:41:31 Yo, what's up?
02:41:32 PCP.
02:41:34 What's up?
02:41:35 Here to ask some relationship advice because that's been.
02:41:39 Okay.
02:41:40 Yeah.
02:41:40 Really?
02:41:40 Interesting.
02:41:43 As much as we are politics experts.
02:41:44 Basically what I'm wondering is I got this chick who's into me
02:41:48 and she wants to like.
02:41:49 Don't say chick.
02:41:50 Date and stuff.
02:41:51 But I really want to because my life is like super busy with
02:41:56 like I'm just going into college now and like all that kind of
02:42:02 stuff and so I don't even want to like deal with girls right now.
02:42:07 So my question is how do I ditch this chick without like being a rude dude?
02:42:18 Okay.
02:42:19 All right.
02:42:19 That's two.
02:42:20 That's two.
02:42:20 I've got the answer.
02:42:21 It's a three word answer.
02:42:23 These little phrase will serve you well in your life.
02:42:25 Pump and dump my dude.
02:42:27 This is the way you do it.
02:42:29 This is the way you should live your life.
02:42:31 That's all there is to it.
02:42:32 Before I said how do I ditch this chick.
02:42:35 I thought I was just like oh you know like I just want to work on my craft you know.
02:42:38 I know right.
02:42:38 I just don't have to ever rush it.
02:42:39 So how do I dump this fucking bitch in the gutter.
02:42:41 This is a weird question.
02:42:42 Well he said how does he do it.
02:42:44 I think he wants to do it in a nice way.
02:42:46 Yeah.
02:42:46 He didn't want to look a nice way.
02:42:48 He's literally just tell her what you told us in this voice.
02:42:51 Just play this play this voicemail.
02:42:53 Your reasoning isn't even mean.
02:42:55 It's totally pragmatic.
02:42:56 I guess like a girl might feel bad that a guy isn't willing to displace his time
02:43:01 on other things to make.
02:43:03 I guess that is a negative thing.
02:43:04 You're saying your time is more valuable.
02:43:06 But just you know you can say I like you.
02:43:08 You're nice but I got stuff to do.
02:43:10 You know.
02:43:13 Relationships are a relationship that you have to foster and you have to put time into.
02:43:17 I mean relationships are like a lot of work and just pure time.
02:43:20 If you don't have that time then it just wouldn't be good for either of you.
02:43:24 I mean the relationship would falter and it wouldn't be a good time.
02:43:26 Honestly I think it's a mark.
02:43:28 I mean this guy says he's applying for college.
02:43:31 Yeah I think so.
02:43:32 I think it's probably a mark.
02:43:33 I think it's a mark of this person's maturity that they would consider that and be like well
02:43:37 you know our relationship will eat into my free time.
02:43:41 Can I afford it right?
02:43:42 Like to even ask that question.
02:43:44 I suspect.
02:43:44 You know you're thinking you're thinking you're thinking the right thing.
02:43:47 Considering this guy and the life situation is that I suspect he's not that into her anyway.
02:43:53 So I mean that seems clear.
02:43:54 So problem.
02:43:56 What are you losing here dude?
02:43:57 I mean there's nothing wrong with a good old pump and dump every once in a while.
02:44:01 So keep that in the back burner.
02:44:02 Sure.
02:44:02 If uh.
02:44:03 But if she wants to know why you won't be her BF.
02:44:06 Just tell her you're just tell her you're busy and you can't fucking.
02:44:09 Yeah.
02:44:10 I'm sorry.
02:44:10 I mean that's really always the best like scenario.
02:44:13 I think for basically like any situation like any relationship is just to be honest.
02:44:18 Yeah.
02:44:19 But don't be afraid to emotionally manipulate her to at least lose your hand holding virginity.
02:44:24 I would definitely go for that.
02:44:25 That's an easy one.
02:44:26 Do that.
02:44:28 Aim for that.
02:44:28 High bar.
02:44:29 Gaslighting too.
02:44:30 Gaslighting is definitely recommend gaslighting.
02:44:33 And don't be afraid to if she ever gives you a guff go in her face and make rapid hand motions.
02:44:37 Go nightmare nightmare nightmare.
02:44:39 That's a good one for confusing.
02:44:40 Love nightmares.
02:44:42 All right.
02:44:42 Next mail is okay.
02:44:43 This is our last one other barely passable one.
02:44:46 This is requiem for a meme.
02:44:49 Let's hear what he has for us.
02:44:50 Go.
02:44:51 Actually didn't realize there was a 90 second.
02:44:55 Rule before I decided to send this little voice mail.
02:44:58 The equivalent of sorry.
02:44:59 I haven't made a video in a while.
02:45:01 Much longer and in detailed story.
02:45:03 You're wasting your 90 seconds.
02:45:04 I'm wasting your 90 seconds.
02:45:06 It's okay.
02:45:06 One part which is my ex-girlfriend is absolutely insane and keeps harassing me.
02:45:11 I've blocked her on all social media.
02:45:13 I've blocked all her friends on social media.
02:45:15 But she keeps showing up to the place I work which is a movie theater.
02:45:19 She keeps showing up for no reason over and over again just to talk to me.
02:45:23 She's got all her friends doing it.
02:45:25 Her friends will show up and buy bottles of water.
02:45:28 Just bottles of water and then leave.
02:45:30 It's a movie theater I work at.
02:45:32 She's apparently spreading rumors about me and how I've got like small penis.
02:45:36 Which I can do whatever fit.
02:45:38 And she's harassing me.
02:45:41 I am 18 years old.
02:45:42 This girl is 17 years old.
02:45:43 She is dating a 22 year old opioid addict.
02:45:47 Fucking.
02:45:48 I don't know why.
02:45:49 What sort of time is he living?
02:45:51 Requiem for a dream over here.
02:45:52 You know it's quite a bit of drama.
02:45:55 So tell me procrastinators.
02:45:56 Because you know you guys seem to be geniuses when it comes to women.
02:45:59 Clearly women.
02:46:00 Yeah that's us.
02:46:01 I'm disputed kings of dealing with femininity.
02:46:03 So please how do I handle this absolutely insane ex-girlfriend.
02:46:08 Keep showing up at my work.
02:46:10 Keeps you know adding me on social media.
02:46:12 Trying to get her boyfriend to attack me.
02:46:14 You know how do I deal with it.
02:46:15 Oh no.
02:46:16 Without shooting someone.
02:46:17 He's like he's he's like.
02:46:18 That's about where I am.
02:46:19 Wait.
02:46:19 He's like sweating right now.
02:46:20 Okay.
02:46:21 While he was recording that like he was being threatened at that very moment.
02:46:25 That guy was like gunpoint that entire fucking voicemail.
02:46:27 Is this a like is this a meme.
02:46:29 Yeah it sounded so cartoonish.
02:46:32 It must be a joke.
02:46:33 It's it's I okay.
02:46:35 I don't know because I don't really remember.
02:46:36 But I think he might be describing the plot of Requiem for a dream.
02:46:40 No no no.
02:46:41 I've seen Requiem for a dream.
02:46:42 It's just about a heroin addict.
02:46:44 There's no like stalker girlfriend in Requiem for a dream.
02:46:47 I don't think.
02:46:47 Been a while.
02:46:48 Okay.
02:46:49 I mean the way he's like laughing as he talks.
02:46:51 Like it doesn't really sound like.
02:46:52 He's not laughing.
02:46:53 He's scared for his life.
02:46:54 He sounded like he could was barely on the breaking point.
02:46:57 It sounded like he was like walking somewhere.
02:46:59 And he's not.
02:46:59 I mean this is kind of.
02:47:00 This is a pretty silly.
02:47:02 This is a pretty silly situation.
02:47:04 I mean it's kind of it's hard to know how serious it is.
02:47:06 I'm guessing based on his demeanor it's not like like life or death.
02:47:09 But it could be just it's absolutely disturbing.
02:47:11 It seems to me so fair and fair enough.
02:47:13 Yeah yeah yeah it is it is a disturbing situation.
02:47:15 I could that's why it's to me it sounds like he's laughing.
02:47:18 Okay let's just assume he's serious.
02:47:21 If we just assume that it's serious.
02:47:22 Okay let's take it on good faith and answer it as though it is serious and maybe.
02:47:26 I've never been in this situation but it seems pretty fucked up.
02:47:29 Yeah this seems like very extreme to the point of like like you know like normal
02:47:33 like reason doesn't seem like it has a place here.
02:47:36 It's weird to me that he just slips in at the end.
02:47:39 He just puts in at the end like oh yeah she said her boyfriend to like fight me.
02:47:42 It's like whoa why isn't that front and center.
02:47:44 Yeah that's pretty crazy.
02:47:45 That seems like the that's that was the typical.
02:47:48 Okay yeah.
02:47:48 But like here's the thing here's the thing.
02:47:52 The the new boyfriend's a fucking cuck if he's doing that.
02:47:55 If if if his girlfriend is like dude my ex is such a bitch go fight him.
02:48:00 I don't like to even think about the fact that girls I date use to have exes.
02:48:03 I like to disassociate from my body and from that reality you know.
02:48:07 Sure sure but imagine imagine.
02:48:09 Maybe it's even better to beat them up though.
02:48:11 That's like how to win over the long term.
02:48:14 Imagine you're dating a girl and she's like my ex is such an asshole.
02:48:18 Go fuck with him.
02:48:19 Like how much of a fucking Roger Roger that's that's big loser activity.
02:48:23 But my ex was so abusive.
02:48:26 He was so talky.
02:48:27 Go fuck with him and his chubby little friend.
02:48:29 Just make me pose very much.
02:48:31 Yeah good idea.
02:48:33 Okay well like I mean so okay well well he says he says attack.
02:48:37 What do you mean by attack?
02:48:38 Do you mean like insult?
02:48:39 Do you mean physically attacked?
02:48:41 Do you mean I'm guessing physical intimidation.
02:48:44 Is it criminal?
02:48:45 If it's criminal I think you could probably file for a restraining order.
02:48:49 Just the general things he's talking about.
02:48:50 Sounds like it's already grains for a restraining order against the girl.
02:48:53 I mean this guy's probably never filed one.
02:48:55 Well her showing up to his place of work.
02:48:58 Her friends coming to his place of work and buying water bottles.
02:49:01 I don't know if that is like severe enough.
02:49:03 It's hard to say.
02:49:04 That you would need to that you could take legal action about it.
02:49:07 And I mean like okay I get that it's probably stressful.
02:49:12 But like who are they really hurting?
02:49:13 They're just showing up and spending money at your place of business.
02:49:16 Well they're talking to him.
02:49:17 He's trying to talk to him.
02:49:19 Okay about what?
02:49:21 It sounded almost like they were trying to talk to him like to get him to get back with
02:49:25 the girl at first.
02:49:26 But then the thing about the boyfriend seems like a harassment campaign.
02:49:31 The spreading rumors is a pretty vicious thing to do about like small dick whatever.
02:49:36 I mean okay this is a man's area where a man has no...
02:49:42 Like a man can't fight back on this battle.
02:49:44 There's nothing you can do other than like get over it.
02:49:47 Anything you do makes you look like you can say no I've got a huge dick.
02:49:49 You look like you have a small dick.
02:49:51 You can I don't know.
02:49:53 There's no way to win.
02:49:54 There's no way to win.
02:49:55 So all you can do is try to get people to understand in whatever capacity that like this
02:50:01 person is just coming from bad faith.
02:50:03 Like don't even specifically refute the claim because that just looks pathetic.
02:50:07 Just be like look this was my girlfriend.
02:50:09 I dumped her or whatever.
02:50:11 She's just mad at me like nothing she says is real or serious assuming that's true.
02:50:16 You know you know I mean this is a you know this is a this is a post breakup scenario.
02:50:22 Like I think people kind of get that like there's can be bad blood there.
02:50:27 And like if one of the if people are talking shit about each other after they break up like
02:50:31 that's normal and not like cause for alarm.
02:50:36 That's true that's true.
02:50:38 And I'm not saying like oh get over it.
02:50:40 Like yeah I get how that would suck.
02:50:42 I'm just saying people will hear that and be like yeah shit talking to her ex.
02:50:47 That's it to be expected.
02:50:48 Yeah I personally I never take any of these claims of like small dick.
02:50:51 I don't think I've ever taken it seriously once in my life.
02:50:53 And some of those people probably have small dicks.
02:50:55 But it's just like you know statistically it's a certainty it's a certainty.
02:51:00 Statistically probably half of them are at or below the average.
02:51:03 Sounds about right.
02:51:05 Okay so on the on the one hand Ben's point is good to like
02:51:09 if these things are concerning you don't try like don't be overly concerned because
02:51:13 it's probably less bad than you're you're right Nate you're right.
02:51:15 This is really this is out of your control.
02:51:17 You can't control what she does.
02:51:19 It's definitely true.
02:51:20 But if she's like stalking him though but hey but take comfort.
02:51:23 Take comfort in the fact.
02:51:24 Yeah other people probably are just hearing this like yeah shit talking.
02:51:28 That's I would say I don't know your circumstance exactly.
02:51:31 But I would involve either my parents or possibly the police if you think it's at that level.
02:51:36 It never hurts to just talk to the police and tell them your situation if you think it's fucked up.
02:51:41 The worst thing they'll say is like sorry dude we can't help you.
02:51:43 And like there's no shame in that if you feel either scared or you know like this is going
02:51:48 beyond what's reasonable.
02:51:50 I feel like if you do talk to the police and like have a record that you did it like lays the
02:51:56 foundation later for like if some if something does happen and it is like a more serious like
02:52:01 threat like makes it more credible like late in the future if you're like okay I filed a
02:52:07 report before nothing happens and I'm filing more again just like repeat behavior.
02:52:11 When they're sifting through like your bloodied remains on the side of the road you can rest
02:52:14 assured that they will see that police paper trail and they'll be like we got a suspect.
02:52:18 We got it under control.
02:52:20 So that's you know yeah that'll be good.
02:52:22 That'll be good to have.
02:52:23 That'll give you much comfort as she pulls out the knife.
02:52:26 I guess the you know it's kind of unfortunate.
02:52:29 I guess the only the only actionable thing here is if it's not that bad if it's not if
02:52:34 they're not doing anything criminal try not to worry about it.
02:52:38 If they are go to the police yeah I mean it seems pretty obvious right right there's nothing
02:52:43 groundbreaking there.
02:52:44 I think the most useful thing we said is the reassurance that people don't take this that
02:52:48 seriously anyway.
02:52:49 I think that'll be comforting.
02:52:50 They definitely take it less seriously than you.
02:52:52 Yeah that's for sure.
02:52:54 Guarantee.
02:52:54 I think that we're all missing a vital component here is that we're all like trying to like
02:52:59 make it so that we make the woman not want to come in like you know ruin his life as well.
02:53:06 But we need to make it so that she doesn't want to and how can you convince someone to not
02:53:10 fuck with another person.
02:53:12 We'll get to show them that the person that might be the object of their hatred has friends
02:53:17 in high places and what higher friends in higher places than the procrastiners podcast.
02:53:23 So I'd say buy some of our merch maybe just the I'm being cool.

02:53:57 Let us know next week.
02:53:59 I'm a little interested in this if this is worse or better.
02:54:01 I guess this is why he was frustrated with the 90 second limit.
02:54:04 There was clearly more nuance to the story.
02:54:06 You know that's fair.
02:54:07 That's fair.
