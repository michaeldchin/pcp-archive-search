00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm the best guy ever and today we've got
00:00:09 Hippo Gibbontake. What's up?
00:00:11 Hey, the the punk plushie Kickstarter is still ongoing. If you don't know what that is, here's a link to it.
00:00:19 It's it's a thing. We talked about it last episode if you in case you didn't watch.
00:00:23 If you want to pump plush, go invest now.
00:00:26 We've got Tom Oliver.
00:00:28 Hey, a pump plush is good and I backed it and you should back it too. Go check out the link that was just thrown down.
00:00:35 It'd go well within a zoomie plush if one existed, which it does not currently.
00:00:39 Oh, it's happening. Oh, it's it's in the works. It will happen. I swear it on my soul.
00:00:45 Ben Saint is here.
00:00:48 Are any of us really here though?
00:00:52 When you think it right down to it. I have a philosophy degree.
00:00:56 Impressive and here's Digi bro. Just your friendly neighborhood boomer with a beer gut.
00:01:05 Tearing through your mom's cunt.
00:01:10 Happy as always to have that happening.
00:01:13 Welcome everybody. Time for another week of the podcast. Hope you've been doing well.
00:01:18 Let's just jump into it. Well, who's got things? I got things. Yeah, let's just jump into it and
00:01:22 hope someone else has something. All right, I've got something. Sun and moon, Pokemon. Okay, no.
00:01:27 Sun and moon. Let's talk about. Wait, I meant shield and sword. Let's talk about Zamazenta and Zashian and how they're bad.
00:01:34 I think they're kind of cool personally. I think Zamaz. I think Zashian's. You dog lover.
00:01:39 I do love dog. Just me. Zashian is okay. I don't think Zashian is worse than like the musketeers.
00:01:46 Which one's the sword? Which one's the sword and which one's the shield? Zashian. Zashian. Okay, that's the sword.
00:01:50 I think Sif is okay. I think shield dog is fucking hideous.
00:01:55 Agreed. He is very silly and it doesn't make a lot of, like, what if I attack him from behind?
00:01:59 But worst of all is just the fact that they look too much alike and have the same fucking color palette.
00:02:03 Are they literally the same Pokemon? Is that a thing? Like, but one got a sword and one got
00:02:08 shield in the different versions of the games? I heard that was a thing. Maybe. Maybe the third
00:02:14 Pokemon, like there's always a third. It's going to be a third. Dog gun. No, no, no. Not a gun.
00:02:20 It'll be like the guy's master. Like, it's a human Pokemon who rears these two dogs.
00:02:24 It's just like a dude with like a leash. He puts them on a leash.
00:02:28 Pokemon trainer Artorias challenges you back. Here's the thing about the third Pokemon. So,
00:02:34 Zashian and Zamazenta, they are cyan and magenta. So the third one will be yellow.
00:02:40 Do they actually look that way though? Do the colors match that? Not at all.
00:02:44 Yeah, well, they kind of do because Zashian is more blue and Zamazenta is more red pinkish.
00:02:50 That makes some sense out of the color palette to me, but like, they could not have made it look
00:02:55 shittier. Like, they could have definitely. Oh, it sucks. Oh, it sucks for sure. I heard one other
00:03:00 theory, which was that. I mean, the logos for Sword and Shield are basically cyan and magenta or
00:03:06 pretty close. That is true. Why didn't they make games of Pokemon cyan and Pokemon magenta, you
00:03:11 know? Maybe that's a little too gay for people. I don't think they're allowed. Well, they got away
00:03:18 from colors at some point. I don't think they're ever going back. I think, yeah, probably not.
00:03:23 I did hear one theory that like, that it's this, I was just watching a bunch of speculation shit.
00:03:28 I think it was that guy, what's his name? Noggin and Lockestein. Lockestein and Noggin,
00:03:32 that guy, she's all right. Well, it's two guys. I only see, I thought it was just one guy who was
00:03:37 like an avatar. I only see the one chubby guy. Yeah. Actually, he lost some weight, though. He's
00:03:42 looking good these days. Good job, dude. I just see that one guy and I don't know if he's Noggin
00:03:47 or Lockestein. He has the most, I watched some old videos. He has the most ridiculous hair I've
00:03:51 ever seen on a human being. It's got this weird, spiky wave, but he's fixing it. I hate what he
00:03:58 represents, which is humans that use like a like really like deliciously rendered cartoon avatar.
00:04:05 And that's their identity. They paid like a couple, maybe a couple hundred bucks to a really
00:04:11 good artist to draw some really fucking lush, to draw a really, really handsome avatar,
00:04:16 really handsome in cartoon form and with like five different expressions and that's the whole
00:04:21 fucking- And we all know that's an alt-right dog whistle if there ever was one. Absolutely.
00:04:27 Okay, but the theory was that these two are like Odin's sword and shield and the third one will
00:04:33 be a spear. But like- You know, I was thinking spear. I was thinking spear. There's some connection
00:04:38 there. How does Odin have to do it? Is this like a Norse? There's like Norse shit going on. Odin
00:04:43 has two pet wolves. God, what about Frecky and Gary and Frecky, I think? I think that's right.
00:04:50 Do these two things even look like wolves? They're just like dogs, right? They're wolves. No, they're
00:04:56 wolves. They're definitely supposed to be wolves. They're absolutely wolves. I can't tell the difference.
00:05:01 Yeah, I mean, not at all. They're looking at a husky with the difference between a wolf.
00:05:04 There is none. It's the same. You're delusional people. Anyway, I don't know. I got really
00:05:09 not much to say. Oh, we could talk about- What do you guys think about Dynamaxing? You're gonna
00:05:13 Dynamax your voice? It sucks. It's bad. I can tell that the game is going to suck because-
00:05:21 It's desperate. Because obviously the fucking priorities are totally wrong.
00:05:26 Well, okay. The fact that they would even think to introduce something like Dynamaxing just
00:05:32 demonstrates that they've failed from the get-go to understand what makes a Pokemon game good.
00:05:38 I thought the mega evolutions were retarded and I thought the other thing from the last gen was
00:05:42 retarded as well. You're right. I kind of agree, but I could sort of defend them as like an experiment,
00:05:50 but the fact that they- But they're still here. They're not going anywhere.
00:05:53 They did it again. They do it every time now. They did it again, but they're doing it with so much
00:05:59 less art direction to it. They're just bigger. I mean, that's just the most obvious thing to
00:06:04 make fun of, but it's the biggest problem with it. There's nothing to it. I think that the one cool
00:06:08 thing about it though is the idea of the raids, like that you fight a giant Pokemon. It's like a
00:06:13 group, it's like an online raid party thing. I think that's neat. I look forward to Dynamaxing
00:06:20 my Wailord and creating a black hole that consumes the entire planet. That'll be fun.
00:06:24 That'll be fun. No, no, because he's lighter than air. He's the float whale.
00:06:29 Wait, does he actually float? It's debatable, but his weight is like- I think I saw someone
00:06:36 calculated it and he only weighs like 800 pounds or something, even though he's like 40 feet long.
00:06:41 But he's huge. Yeah. I think he might technically be lighter than air and his type is the float-
00:06:47 he's the float whale Pokemon, so he might literally just float.
00:06:52 What about the Alolan Exeggutor? Would he hit the Skybox?
00:06:56 Oh yeah, he goes into the atmosphere for sure. Oh my God, Dynamaxing an Alolan Exeggutor would be
00:07:00 so sick. Well, now you're officially sold on it. Okay, some of these gimmick ideas are good.
00:07:08 It's a good idea in that I would like to see a gif of it. I don't want to buy a video game
00:07:12 because of it, you know? I mean, I like the Z moves for the sole one reason that it had that
00:07:17 really funny clip of Snorlax when he wakes up and does his funny charge attack with his sparkling
00:07:23 eyes of death. I don't inherently hate mega evolutions. I don't inherently hate Z moves,
00:07:28 but it's enough. Stop, stop. It's a weird- It's over. This is what's happening now.
00:07:34 I just hope that- The only thing that pissed me off about this fucking game, on the one hand,
00:07:40 console RPG Pokémon is something I've dreamed of since I was a child. X and Y already gave me
00:07:48 the taste of it, where seeing it in 3D finally was like, oh my God, this is what I always wanted it
00:07:54 to be. Sun and Moon made it better by opening up the environments and stuff. Except fucking Colosseum
00:08:00 had way better animations than any of the fucking new 3D actual mainline Pokémon games.
00:08:04 Does Colosseum use the same- Yeah. Okay, it's not that the models are better. It's the animations
00:08:11 are infinitely better. It's not used for Pokémon Stadium. Okay, well, yeah, and that's the same
00:08:17 ones from Pokémon XD, right? Yeah. Because the Pokémon and XD look fucking ridiculous. I know,
00:08:23 that's why they're great. They're sick. Sometimes they're great. There's personality. They look
00:08:27 ridiculous because the models from Pokémon XD are all ripped from Pokémon Stadium and Pokémon
00:08:31 Stadium too. They are just N64. Yeah, okay. It's all right. I mean, have you seen Pokémon Stadium?
00:08:38 I mean, Golbat's really funny. Have you seen Golbat? Yes, and he's awesome. He stands with
00:08:43 his wings wrapped around him, just like rocking back and forth, like waddling. I love that guy.
00:08:48 It's great. It's great. But it's terrible, but I love it. All the Nintendo 64 animations
00:08:54 had, obviously, since they were less Pokémon, they had more personality in each of the
00:08:59 animations. It's literally Soul vs. Soul. Me and Munchy recently finished our
00:09:05 Nightmarishly long Pokémon XD Nuzlocke on the RFCK channel, and link in the description.
00:09:17 Kangaskhan is like a fucking seizure nightmare. Really? Yeah, I don't remember. I haven't seen
00:09:23 that one. Kangaskhan is just like a mess of constantly flailing, and a lot of them are like
00:09:29 that. They're really weird. Whoever designed some of them. Fair enough. As much as I'd love to go
00:09:35 into the bones of every technical thing wrong with these children's games, the thing that bothered me
00:09:40 the most is that it's on the Switch, and the Switch is a $300 console, and there's two of the games
00:09:49 still. So it used to be, hey, me and my brother would each get the two different versions on our
00:09:56 Gameboys. It's perfectly reasonable for you and your sibling to both have a Gameboy. For you and
00:10:02 someone else sharing your house to both own a $300 console is just a lot more, and it's like,
00:10:08 I was really looking forward to getting to play this with Mei. Both of us get the two different
00:10:12 games, play together, but it's on the fucking Switch. So now I just finally bought a Switch.
00:10:17 Now she would have to also buy a Switch for us to play simultaneously, and if they fucking make
00:10:22 this game still only one save file per game, I'm gonna fucking throw fit. Yeah, they will. That's
00:10:28 a whole like fucking grandfathered in bullshit that Pokemon's always done. That should not be
00:10:34 excusable. Just one save file per game. It initially was a fucking memory issue, and there's no reason
00:10:40 they couldn't change that in the future. Maybe they like the idea of it's kind of Animal Crossing
00:10:45 where Animal Crossing intentionally says this is your world. You have one world.
00:10:50 You can play as multiple characters in that world. It's like Dark Souls. It's like Dark Souls.
00:10:53 Even Dark Souls lets you have multiple save files now. Wait, it does? Okay, never mind.
00:10:57 Yeah, you can have as many characters as that game as you want. The thing about Pokemon is they
00:11:04 obviously do it just to push system sales. There's no other reason other than it forces your friends
00:11:11 or siblings or whoever you would be sharing this game with to also own a copy. Actually,
00:11:15 the good news about the Switch is like, you know how you can have different profiles? I think
00:11:19 even with a game like Pokemon or Animal Crossing, every profile on your Switch account does have
00:11:24 like its own save file of every single game. If that's true, then it will, then it'll be fine,
00:11:29 but like it still is annoying to know that like I can't just pass, you know, like the idea of a
00:11:35 $300 console to play two fucking of the same game is just infuriating. I hear you. I hear you.
00:11:43 What can you do? What can you do? To move the conversation from Pokemon to, you got something
00:11:49 to say, Nate? Wait, wait, I have one final thing to say on the subject and it's just that. So,
00:11:53 gyms are the best thing about Pokemon. They were always the most fun and the most interesting
00:11:58 and the most cool and they were great, like, I don't know, like progression meter of how you're
00:12:03 doing. And we saw like in the new trailer, like, uh, it's just that in the new trailer, it's like
00:12:08 you're in like a stadium, you're going to get like super popular or something. Like that's all
00:12:11 fine. But it looks like Dynamaxing is going to be like a main component of gym battles is what it
00:12:17 looked like. And I'm just saying, oh, great. Now instead of like my Pokemon skill at the game,
00:12:22 I'm just going to have to deal with this fucking Dynamaxing stuff. I mean, it's like the Dynamaxing
00:12:29 thing is like a thing. I mean, it's like a Z move. It's like a thing you have to use strategically.
00:12:36 I don't think Dynamaxing in and of itself is bad. They said only last like three turns.
00:12:40 Yeah, you guys are all fucking gay. This looks cool. I like Dynamaxing.
00:12:45 Oh, you just like it because you're Godzilla shit. Yeah, yeah, I do. Tell me how it looks cool.
00:12:49 How does it look cool at all? Because they're big and it's fucking cool. I like the idea. I think
00:12:55 everyone's always dogging on Pokemon. You're all gay. You know what? You know what? I think
00:13:03 one Pokemon can do it for three turns in a battle. It's not going to overtake anything. It's just
00:13:07 another extra layer. It's fine. It's not going to be a huge deal. You know what I think would be
00:13:11 cooler? You know what I think would be cooler is if Dynamax battles were like a different mode of
00:13:15 battling, like you can have triple battles and double battles and rotation battles. What if just
00:13:21 there were some Dynamax battles where it was like maybe you only get sort of how would you balance
00:13:26 that though? It'd be a whole different game. Well, I mean, yeah, I don't know. Maybe it's just each
00:13:32 one is like one monster versus one monster. Maybe they each have like everybody's giant. What's the
00:13:37 point then? You know, because if everybody's giant, then they know what he is. Just looks cool. I don't
00:13:43 know. That was the problem I was having with it was like it seemed to be every gym or like you
00:13:49 have this power and you can activate it potentially in every battle if you wanted to, I guess.
00:13:56 I like the idea of like a final boss sort of like, oh, you know, the evil villain has like a power.
00:14:05 Like when a hot blonde lady fused with that one Ultra Beast in Sun and Moon or whatever. That was
00:14:11 you know, that was okay. Yeah, right, right. Like if the villain team of this game is like
00:14:19 getting technology to turn Pokemon big and then you have to fight the leader and he has a big
00:14:24 Pokemon and you have like your whole party, but like you don't get like that until after that.
00:14:30 Maybe, I mean, maybe that's what it is, but it feels like it's like a thing at the start of the
00:14:34 game. You can just become big and then you get big through the game and it just loses its appeal.
00:14:39 I doubt it'll be at the very start of the game. Because like the Z moves were such a
00:14:43 fucking pain in the ass to even acquire in the last game that I never used. Well,
00:14:47 we know it'll happen at the first gym at the latest because we saw it in the first gym.
00:14:51 Yeah, you're right. You're right. So, you know, the Milo, it's, it kind of looks to me like maybe
00:14:56 you can only Dynamax in certain places. Like maybe you can only do it in gyms and raids and maybe
00:15:03 certain other specific times. Hey, Ben. Ben, did you notice that they made a new
00:15:09 killer Pokemon? Oh, the, um, the bird, the fucking bird. That was the most killer ass thing I have
00:15:15 ever seen. That thing is so killer. That thing is my new favorite Pokemon. He is. Is that what it's
00:15:20 called? Corviknight? Corviknight. That's right. That's right. I, I do like it, although it's like,
00:15:25 it's, I mean, it certainly looks flying. No, wait, it's flying steel, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
00:15:30 okay, okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, how do you know? Because they told us. They told us. Did they?
00:15:35 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they released info. I'll take your word for it. Shot. Everyone was saying like
00:15:40 Skamori finally has a friend. Yeah. Yeah, there's a new Skarmory. Well, cool. Yeah, it was pretty good.
00:15:48 Very killer. Very gothic. I can't wait to have a team of six. Ben, is your favorite Pokemon still
00:15:56 Gothelita, Gothetella, whatever? Gothetell, Gothetell. She's, I mean, she's never been my favorite,
00:16:01 but I do like her. I like her a lot. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. I was going to say,
00:16:05 because she sucks. Is there a fucking Pokemon called Gothelita? What? Yes. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, well,
00:16:10 she's my Pokemon waifu for sure. Okay, great. Let's talk about Pokemon again. Hippo, what did
00:16:15 you want to talk about? Oh yeah, I was going to change the topic from Pokemon to Pokemon the anime,
00:16:22 because, because last, last episode, I had a, I had a moment where I was like, whoa,
00:16:30 Pokemon's free. I mean, I could pirate it easily. It's fine. But like on the Pokemon website,
00:16:35 they have every episode of all Pokemon just in all of it all the way up through the current.
00:16:40 Yeah, like, well, that's what I'm going to do from now on. So I've been going, I, as a youngster,
00:16:50 I got up to like the first league, and Ash last, and that's what I remember. And then I watched the
00:16:56 movie, and I don't think I watched the anime properly after that. So I've been picking it up from
00:17:01 the Orange Island saga, and it sucks. No, I'm really enjoying it because yeah, okay, okay,
00:17:08 the anime is good. All right, we gotta talk about this. It's really colorful and really nice,
00:17:13 and the music's great. And some of the animation is like surprisingly really good. I've looked
00:17:20 around for Sakuga Meisters to find out who animated like certain episodes. Team Rocket
00:17:27 is the best thing to happen in the Pokemon franchise as a whole. Yeah, they have the most
00:17:32 personality for sure. Pokemon has always been enjoyable and fun, except for maybe advanced
00:17:38 generation. But the, the Orange Islands, like as a kid, I think that I and a lot of other people
00:17:46 lost interest in the series at that point, just because it wasn't the games. Like we had all played
00:17:51 the games. And what are those fucking weird, like abstract, like post-modern looking badges you're
00:17:56 getting, Ash? Like, yeah. Well, and, and like, Golden Silver had already been out. So like, we had
00:18:01 played those games, we're expecting Johto, and then we get this weird other thing, and it was like,
00:18:06 it felt like kind of a slap in the face just because it was like, I haven't gotten to experience
00:18:11 these gyms. Like, I don't know who these, these gym leaders are, but like, I actually think that
00:18:16 section of the anime was probably one of the more conceptually interesting parts, because,
00:18:21 you know, since they weren't going on source material, they were just able to make up their own
00:18:26 stuff. Hey, this is a very high bar, though. Yeah, dude, Pokemon anime is good. It is very good.
00:18:31 I can still return to it. And I just watched an episode the other day that was fucking hilarious.
00:18:37 The dub is fun. Like, I honestly enjoy the Pokemon dub because they, they clearly intended to make
00:18:44 it a comedy series. Like, they were trying to be funny, and like, the acting's stupid as fuck,
00:18:49 but like, the dialogue works with that. So it's, it's almost like a parody dub.
00:18:54 The frying pan is the drying pan. Yeah.
00:19:00 That is funny. That is good. Who am I? I am Brock. Slimes like that.
00:19:07 By the way, uh, yeah, Brock leaves in the Orange Islands, which I had never, I had never knew
00:19:13 and known. Tracy, don't you love Tracy? Tracy is like really boring, but there's one thing that I
00:19:19 like about this new dynamic is that without Brock, um, Tracy is like not as much of a pervert,
00:19:26 but he does notice that Ash and Misty like each other and he's pointing it out like every
00:19:30 episode and they're all blushing and it's like this whole romance thing is coming to the forefront.
00:19:35 I know, I know that it doesn't go anywhere because, yeah, Misty gets cut and, and like,
00:19:40 she leaves and I'm, I'm, I'm waiting for that moment in the anime where I can be like,
00:19:44 ah, it sucks now and I can stop because I don't actually want to watch like 700,000 episodes.
00:19:49 Dude, but it gets, but it'll never happen. You're gonna watch them all. You're true.
00:19:52 I mean, Pokemon like, it gets, there's a shitty part because if you get to Advanced
00:19:57 Generation when they introduce May and Max, May and Max suck. The episodes get really formulaic.
00:20:02 That part of the anime is not that good. Uh, the next season after that with, uh, with Dawn is,
00:20:07 is whatever, but like, it picks up again as of Best Wishes or Black and White. Like, the show
00:20:14 gets great again and, uh, is definitely worth watching. Although the dub is no longer as good
00:20:20 and funny and iconic because they replaced all the actors in like Advanced and all the new ones
00:20:25 are fucking terrible, but, um, but fucking Pokemon Sun and Moon and brought in Keeper Sutherland
00:20:31 for Ash. Pokemon Sun and Moon is the best one. It's super fucking, it's colorful and adorable
00:20:37 and it's, it's not actually an adventure show. It's like, uh, it just takes place in one city
00:20:43 and the action comes to them and like Ash doesn't have like companions. He's just kind of at this
00:20:48 Pokemon school with like all the gym leaders from the game in it or like most of them and, uh,
00:20:54 the girls are super fucking hot and it's like the most interesting animation.
00:20:58 Is it like still getting badges or something or whatever they fucking do?
00:21:01 Uh, I don't know because I haven't watched that much of it, but like in what I've seen,
00:21:04 it was mostly just like a slice of life show in Alola, but with like really amazing animation
00:21:10 and, uh, an art style. It looks fucking awesome and it's, that's cool. Very pleasing.
00:21:15 And, uh, one thing, uh, is that I found like, I'd never really had a Pokemon waifu. Misty was
00:21:21 the closest, but I think I found one, uh, in Professor Ivy because look at how
00:21:26 right, uh, look at that, look at that wreck. Look at how big she is.
00:21:30 I'm pretty sure Tracy ends up fucking cooing their shit.
00:21:33 Oh, okay. I guess she's, so she's the Orange Islands lady.
00:21:37 Yeah, she's, she's, that is quite a wreck. Jesus Christ.
00:21:39 Wait, wait, wait, where'd you post it? Where, where is this?
00:21:41 I posted it in the thing, you know, gross discussing audio links.
00:21:45 That is girth. That's serious girth right there.
00:21:48 The wreck is fucking intense.
00:21:50 Could, could, could be bigger, could be bigger, but I'll take it.
00:21:54 She is the reason Brooke left, uh, because he wanted to stay and help her because she's a
00:21:58 star. Oh my God. Yeah, he makes sense.
00:22:03 Doesn't she kind of talk like she has to downs?
00:22:05 She's always like, oh yeah, she's like, uh, yes, I, I said that we, no, she's not,
00:22:10 she's not the island time, man. So she's name is, is Brock like you? Did he go full retard?
00:22:17 Why, am I like getting GF and then going for retard? No, no, by dated, by fucking retarded girl.
00:22:22 Oh, right. It's really trading up to the value brand, in my opinion.
00:22:32 Classic meme. Hi, Michelle. Get fucked.
00:22:35 Oh yeah. Yeah. Um, well, good Pokemon's good.
00:22:40 Oh, one, one, one more thing about like Pokemon, uh, the anime, I've noticed that a lot of the
00:22:46 times when they're introducing or like talking about like this, this new islands where they
00:22:51 grow grapefruits and, um, or this new island where they blow glass and stuff, it's just like
00:22:56 they, they come up with a thing and the animation of like, you know, the backstory of like what this
00:23:03 island does and what these people do is actually quite like lovingly crafted and, um, the, you know,
00:23:10 attention to detail for a lot of things, a lot of parts of the episode, um, uh, like for no real
00:23:16 reason, uh, made to explain what these things are. And I feel like, uh, it's like half trying to be
00:23:23 educational, but it really comes across natural and not forced. And I like that. I really appreciate,
00:23:29 like the, in the glass thing, they have like a few scenes showing how the glass is made.
00:23:36 And it looks like, like documentaries I've seen of like glass blowing factories and stuff and
00:23:40 traditional methods and they just have a few background characters doing that and with a
00:23:44 Pokemon helping them with the fire and stuff. And it's, I feel like that sort of thing. I don't
00:23:49 know whether they had it in the Indigo League as much. Um, but I feel like that sort of like real
00:23:55 world, um, aspect to the Pokemon anime is supposed to ground it in reality so that a kid who has seen
00:24:02 those things in real life can sort of be like, ah, Pokemon could be real. I'll go outside and find one
00:24:09 like the, the Pokemon are just sort of living in amongst this realistic world that could exist.
00:24:15 And it's, uh, it's really cool. You know, that all does sound very cool. And, but I think it was
00:24:20 kind of that same thing. I think that like as a hot-blooded, like my biggest problem with Pokemon,
00:24:25 watching it from the start was like, Ash, just get a new fucking badge, you pussy, catch every
00:24:30 Pokemon. Cause that's how I played the game. And it's like annoying when Ash isn't playing it the
00:24:34 way that I want to play it in my video game world. And sounds like, like these are all good things
00:24:39 about the, the show, but like, it sounds like more of the stuff that frustrated me. Ash's whole
00:24:43 character arc is about the fact that he is not a good trainer. He slowly gives up his dreams of
00:24:49 actually being like a good trainer or a champion or anything. No, no, it's just that the anime
00:24:54 resets basically after Johto and then constantly resets. But like up through the Johto League,
00:25:01 there's an arc about the fact that like Ash has his heart in the right place. And that's why
00:25:06 everybody respect, like, you know, wants to like him, but he's just ignorant and doesn't really try
00:25:12 to learn how to be better. And that's why he loses in the Indigo League is that he just straight up
00:25:17 doesn't know what he's doing. And like, he's never,
00:25:22 cause he's never trained it well. When he loses to Richie, right?
00:25:24 Yeah. And then in the Orange Islands, there's a whole episode about him finally like,
00:25:29 you know, training Charizard properly and getting his respect.
00:25:34 And then he becomes his like fucking pitch hitter for like a million seasons or something.
00:25:37 Well, no, because then he gets rid of him in like early Johto.
00:25:40 Yeah, Ash gets rid of all his good Pokemon.
00:25:43 Yeah, because they always end up, because Charizard goes to live in like the Valley of
00:25:46 the Charizards or whatever the fuck. Right, to get good and swole and huge, which is sick.
00:25:51 Goes to the Valley of Drakes, hangs out with his friends.
00:25:53 Yeah, but he gives up his, I mean, whatever, we all know that Ash gives up.
00:25:56 Tom over here with all the fucking Dark Souls references all of a sudden.
00:26:00 I just played it. All right, it's all there.
00:26:02 You hate Dark Souls, Tom. Yeah, that's your whole personality, Tom.
00:26:07 He's hating Dark Souls. Without that, there'll be nothing left.
00:26:11 What's your status on Dark Souls these days, Tom?
00:26:15 I'm like, I haven't touched video games like the last two weeks.
00:26:19 I've been so busy working on stuff, but I beat Dark Souls.
00:26:22 One, I got, I started playing it again just for shits and giggles.
00:26:26 I got the sense fortress this time, like, I don't want to deal with this, so I stopped.
00:26:30 I'm playing Dark Souls 3. I'm at, I'm like halfway done, I think.
00:26:34 Fighting the guy who like, he's the two brothers, whatever, in the fucking...
00:26:39 Ornstein and Smough. It's just cool, two brothers.
00:26:41 Yeah, those guys, no. It's like the guy who like crawls around on his knees with a big sword.
00:26:45 Oh, the Lothric princes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:26:49 And I'm getting destroyed. Wait, that's like at the end of the game.
00:26:51 Yeah, it's pretty far. It's pretty far.
00:26:53 That's like one of the last bosses. Well, I guess I'm almost done then.
00:26:55 I mean, he might not have, have you gotten all the other Souls of Cinder yet?
00:26:59 I haven't gotten, I've gotten three out of four, I believe.
00:27:01 Wait, are you talking about Dark Souls 3?
00:27:04 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:27:05 Oh fuck, okay. I'm confused. Never played it.
00:27:08 So, I'm just...
00:27:08 Okay, but basically you've changed. You seem to be liking Dark Souls in general. Is that fair?
00:27:14 Sure. I think Bloodborne's the best one out of all of them by far.
00:27:17 Yeah, okay. That's fair.
00:27:18 So, I take, I take a Bloodborne 2 before anything else.
00:27:23 Maybe one day. Maybe one day.
00:27:25 So, Breath of the Wild.
00:27:27 Now, Breath of the Wild seems like the kind of game that I would really like,
00:27:31 but I still don't want to play it. And I don't know why.
00:27:34 I don't know why you think you would like it that much, Ben. What about it appeals to you?
00:27:40 The openness and the freedom and the robustness of the systems and the like the ability,
00:27:45 like the item transformation and cooking and shit, that all seems really cool.
00:27:49 The only problem with all that is that the game is
00:27:52 I mean, I don't know, maybe you'd enjoy it on like the higher difficulty that I think you can unlock,
00:27:56 but like as a baseline, you don't need to do any of that shit.
00:28:01 Like the game really is not hard enough to require you to do that stuff.
00:28:06 But I do think you'd enjoy it.
00:28:07 Some things I think you do need that for.
00:28:09 Like for, I remember being plagued by lightning, like many times on my like first playthrough,
00:28:14 and like, if you play like lightning is a bitch.
00:28:18 Yeah, you just have to un-equip your metal stuff and it's fine.
00:28:21 Is that the only thing you have to do?
00:28:22 Because I was still getting struck even after unequipping it though.
00:28:24 You shouldn't get struck by lightning.
00:28:25 There might have been something you still had equipped that was metal.
00:28:28 Huh. Okay. But see, that's the sort of thing.
00:28:30 Maybe I just missed that because I thought I, ah, whatever.
00:28:33 Fuck it.
00:28:34 Point is there's lots of little things like that that you got to know.
00:28:36 I don't, don't you equip the rubber suit specifically?
00:28:39 No.
00:28:40 And like that's how you avoid lightning?
00:28:41 No. If you're not wearing any metal, you shouldn't get hit by lightning.
00:28:44 Yeah. I mean, if you're wearing your rubber armor, it reduces lightning damage.
00:28:48 I didn't even know there was rubber armor and I haven't as well gotten hit by lightning once.
00:28:53 Well, okay. Like the climbing, right? The climbing is kind of,
00:28:56 you really do need to level up your climbing to like get to some places.
00:28:59 I've literally gotten everywhere in the game on only two extensions of the,
00:29:04 of the stamina wheel.
00:29:07 I can literally climb anything in the game on two extensions of the stamina wheel,
00:29:11 except for making the like-
00:29:11 Are there like some towers you straight up won't be able to climb if you don't level up your fucking-
00:29:15 Like the main towers? No.
00:29:17 Yeah. Like the main towers you got to use to unlock.
00:29:18 You just got to be smart about how you climb them.
00:29:21 Like the game, because what I like about the game is that they put a lot of thought
00:29:27 into the topography of the game.
00:29:28 And if you, you know, just look at your environment carefully enough,
00:29:33 you can find an alternate route.
00:29:35 There's always like a path.
00:29:36 Like there's an intended path through all most of these things.
00:29:39 And sometimes you need a special thing.
00:29:40 As long as you're paying attention to like the slopes and the angles of the slopes,
00:29:44 like you can figure out where you can stand and recharge.
00:29:46 So like, I don't know, I managed to climb the whole fucking big,
00:29:51 the biggest mountain area without having to upgrade very much.
00:29:55 Like-
00:29:55 Well, she-
00:29:56 I mean, even if you don't want to upgrade your stamina,
00:29:58 you can always brute force it because if you make good recipes-
00:30:01 Oh, you can make items and use them.
00:30:02 And yeah, that's true.
00:30:03 Yeah, I've done none of that.
00:30:05 I have not cooked once at the end of the game.
00:30:08 There's like a really cool moment in the beginning.
00:30:09 Like one of the coolest things for me about Breath of the Wild in the beginning
00:30:12 was when you're like talking with the old guy who's like teaching you how to do shit.
00:30:15 And one of the little many things you can do is like,
00:30:17 you have to go to this like ice place,
00:30:20 like this cold like roof top thing, like mountain top.
00:30:24 And you can like cook a bunch of things to like kind of like
00:30:28 temporarily make it so you can go in cold environments and be okay.
00:30:31 Or you can optionally like go and like read his diary
00:30:35 and he's like trying to find a recipe that he forgot about.
00:30:39 And if you do that, he'll give you a warm coat and then you can just go there.
00:30:42 And it just felt cool.
00:30:43 I just carried a torch.
00:30:43 That's a lot of fun.
00:30:44 That's a lot of fun.
00:30:45 Or oh.
00:30:47 Yeah.
00:30:47 And I didn't learn how to cook until more than halfway through the game.
00:30:51 God damn it, dude.
00:30:52 I was just like, where's the tutorial?
00:30:54 Like how the fuck do you cook?
00:30:55 I don't understand because there's nowhere to go and click on something and it says cook.
00:30:59 I got so into cooking because there was a there's a point in the game where you have to-
00:31:03 I think I would get really into cooking.
00:31:05 I think you would, Ben.
00:31:06 I think it would stop you from doing anything else.
00:31:08 I think you would just be cooking all the time.
00:31:10 Yeah, I'd just be like, oh my god, I gotta find some fucking black lines and sour potatoes
00:31:18 and dire apples to make a stew.
00:31:20 It is definitely absurdly real.
00:31:21 There are quests all about making recipes in the game.
00:31:23 And the great thing about that is because it's such an impetus to explore the whole
00:31:27 world because certain ingredients only exist in certain places, so you've got to explore.
00:31:31 Which is why I replayed it recently.
00:31:33 But the thing is, I found a bunch of new shrines that I hadn't done before and that was cool.
00:31:38 But the second, I found every tower and it's so satisfying to unlock a tower.
00:31:43 But the second I unlocked my final tower, I had only beaten one of the main beast dungeons.
00:31:49 I hadn't beaten Ganon.
00:31:51 As soon as I got that last tower, I was like, I'm done.
00:31:53 I'm literally done.
00:31:53 I don't care anymore.
00:31:54 I kind of felt that way as well because getting the towers was the main incentive drive force.
00:32:00 It's so much fun.
00:32:00 That's what I loved.
00:32:01 I want to play again and just do it again because it's so much fun.
00:32:05 But I think that the biggest problem I have with Breath of the Wild is that it needed quest lines.
00:32:10 Not just quests, but quest lines that would force you to do a bunch of things.
00:32:16 Because just playing through the game normally, it's so easy to just go to the...
00:32:19 You need a big gore on sword quest, motherfuckers.
00:32:21 I was going to say a big gore on sword.
00:32:23 Yeah, well, I'm sure there's stuff like that.
00:32:25 But it should have been a lot of the game because it's formatted like in MMO,
00:32:29 like when you go to different regions and stuff.
00:32:31 There should have been quest lines that take you through the whole region.
00:32:34 That you have to do everything because as it stands, the game is basically just
00:32:39 run to a place and do a thing.
00:32:40 So it's like you can just run straight to the towers.
00:32:43 You can just go straight to the villages of each of the four races and just do the...
00:32:48 Fight the ancient guy or whatever.
00:32:51 Like most of the side quests are just go to a place and do a thing.
00:32:54 So it's like there's a lot.
00:32:55 There's a ton of shit to do.
00:32:57 There's a ton of secrets.
00:32:59 Fuckloads of shrines, fuckloads of Korak seeds, all that stuff.
00:33:02 But all of it is just go somewhere and do something.
00:33:03 It's just a lot of it's really basic.
00:33:04 And then the story on top of it isn't very captivating.
00:33:06 Well, and nothing drives you to go do it.
00:33:08 Like there's no...
00:33:09 Like why would I choose this thing over that thing?
00:33:11 Like why would I pick these?
00:33:13 Breath of the Wild is super great.
00:33:14 What it needs, it needs like a...
00:33:16 Just for example, like a Final Fantasy VII,
00:33:19 like story and quest lines just overlaid on top of it with the existing characters.
00:33:24 And then it'd be like the greatest game ever made.
00:33:26 I think another thing that is difficult for me to get into the game is that...
00:33:30 Yeah.
00:33:30 Like in RPGs mainly, like your rewards for doing quest lines is gear,
00:33:34 but like the gear in Breath of the Wild by its very nature doesn't really matter
00:33:38 because like you're never going to get a cool weapon.
00:33:40 Well, some gear, like like at the very beginning quest,
00:33:42 getting that cold weather gear makes a huge difference to your actual game.
00:33:46 Your armor, like that's really satisfying.
00:33:47 The coolest thing for me was finding the fairies and being able to upgrade your armor
00:33:50 because your armor doesn't break.
00:33:51 Yes, that's a lot of fun.
00:33:52 For some reason in Breath of the Wild, the cloth is more durable than steel.
00:33:55 Don't ask me how, but that's just how it works.
00:33:58 But like that was cool to be able to like find...
00:34:00 You gotta go find certain ingredients and items and stuff to give to the fairies
00:34:03 so they'll upgrade your gear so it will be better.
00:34:04 I mean, it's like in Dark Souls, doing a quest line can result in you just like
00:34:08 getting an armor set that you can't get anywhere else.
00:34:10 Like I'd be pretty happy with that, even if it's just for fashion souls or you know,
00:34:13 fashion zeldas.
00:34:15 That can be pretty satisfying, I think.
00:34:16 Yeah, it's like there's not enough...
00:34:18 If the game had some kind of experience system,
00:34:21 it would be...
00:34:22 It would one, instantly change everything for me.
00:34:25 If there was leveling up, I would...
00:34:28 That goes a big way because I just avoid mobs.
00:34:30 I hate fighting mobs in that game.
00:34:32 Right.
00:34:32 Fighting sucks because...
00:34:34 Why do it?
00:34:34 Literally, why?
00:34:35 It just puts you in a worse position in the dungeon.
00:34:37 For that chest of like 30 rupees, is that why I'm gonna expend like 30 explosive arrows and shit?
00:34:42 There is a lot of stuff to buy, so it's not like having lots of rupees isn't good, but like...
00:34:47 But once you unlock the snowball game, that's just the fastest way to get rupees.
00:34:50 And so I just do that end game and I ignore buying anything up to that point.
00:34:55 For me, the problem is like...
00:34:56 There's a lot of areas where it's impossible to gauge whether you should go there yet.
00:35:01 Like you see an enemy.
00:35:02 Yeah.
00:35:03 You know what?
00:35:03 I'm talking too much about this because I'm planning to talk about it in another place anyway,
00:35:06 and I don't want to spoil my whole goddamn review of the game, but...
00:35:10 All right, fair enough.
00:35:11 So, um...
00:35:12 Hmm?
00:35:13 I don't want to cut you off.
00:35:14 All I was gonna say is the thing that like...
00:35:16 The funniest thing that I did in Breath of the Wild is there's a quest early on where you have to like
00:35:20 stealth around a Lionel and like collect arrows or something for the boss battle.
00:35:25 I didn't know that was a stealth section and brute force it and killed it.
00:35:29 And over like 15 tries and it was the coolest thing ever because I told my friend...
00:35:33 Did you fight that guy?
00:35:34 I fought him and I beat him.
00:35:35 It took like 15 attempts.
00:35:36 You fucking beat...
00:35:37 I've never beaten a Lionel to this day.
00:35:39 What?
00:35:39 I just ignore them because I'm scared.
00:35:40 Dude, I fucking could've stopped Lionel now.
00:35:41 No, you know what?
00:35:41 End game, I might have fought one or two, but uh...
00:35:44 I go out and hunt them for fun.
00:35:46 Jesus Christ, you're more of a man than I ever will be, Tom.
00:35:48 That's the best part about the game.
00:35:52 Okay, literally I'm just...
00:35:53 How did you...
00:35:54 Because I ran out of weapons several times early on while fighting Lionels.
00:35:58 How'd you beat him?
00:35:58 What'd you do?
00:35:59 Oh god, it was just like...
00:36:00 That's why I got so into cooking because I was like...
00:36:03 Only had like five hearts at the start.
00:36:04 Durability and stopping.
00:36:05 And I just like...
00:36:06 I must really suck at this game if it expects me to beat this Lionel
00:36:09 because I didn't know it was a stealth section.
00:36:11 So I was like, okay, I guess I'm just gonna have to go get really good recipes
00:36:14 and figure out shit so I can like get bonus hearts
00:36:17 and just stack all the best weapons I can.
00:36:20 I got...
00:36:20 The thing is...
00:36:21 The reason I was able to beat it is because I learned the pattern so well
00:36:25 I just was automatically able to counter everything it was doing
00:36:28 because like there's like a parry system.
00:36:30 So I got so good I just parried all of his hits
00:36:32 and like the whole fight happened in slow-mo
00:36:34 and it was fucking sick.
00:36:35 And it was the best part of the entire game.
00:36:37 The game speaks to a problem with me as a gamer
00:36:41 which is that I will always choose to engage with as few systems as necessary to beat a game.
00:36:47 Right, right.
00:36:48 Like I get some sick pleasure out of seeing how badly I can play and still win.
00:36:54 Like how little I can contribute.
00:36:57 Like a game like Dark Souls, there's so many different things you could do
00:37:01 but you could just put your points into strength and stamina and just overpower everything.
00:37:04 Ever since you told me about that, all I do in a Dark Souls,
00:37:07 I just pump up my HP to insane heights and right now I'm playing a dex character
00:37:11 so it's all dex.
00:37:12 It's like there's so many different things you could do
00:37:14 and I understand why other people do it just as a way to find fun in the game.
00:37:19 But I'm not somebody who's gonna play the same game over and over again
00:37:24 just to fuck around and experiment.
00:37:25 So it's like I'm always just gonna try to get it over with as fast as possible.
00:37:28 So it's like there are games that force you to engage with all the systems in order to win
00:37:35 and I think that that's the only way I'll get to really have that mind expansion moment of like,
00:37:40 oh shit there's so much you can do in this game.
00:37:43 That's why I love, I like when games let you ease and casually,
00:37:46 low skill floor, high skill ceiling.
00:37:48 And like Kingdom Hearts 2, I think does a great job,
00:37:50 eases you in casually, but then like critical mode or whatever,
00:37:53 final mix stuff, it's got like all these super bosses that you need to learn how to fight.
00:37:57 And that's for me that's why I like that.
00:37:58 That's why I do, if I ever play Breath of the Wild again,
00:38:01 I'll definitely do it in a higher difficulty just because I was expecting to be forced to
00:38:05 learn things.
00:38:06 Like I was expecting to hit a wall at some point and like when I first,
00:38:10 cause I did Zora's domain first, then I went to Death Mountain and it was like,
00:38:14 the enemies seemed too strong for me.
00:38:16 So I was like, okay, the way that the map looks,
00:38:19 it looks like this is where you're supposed to go second.
00:38:21 So like maybe I really need to go grind and like learn how to play.
00:38:25 And then I just went to the Ruto domain, Rito?
00:38:29 The birds.
00:38:30 So the birds?
00:38:30 I went and did the birds and that was easier than the Zora plays.
00:38:34 And then like by the end of that, I had kind of gotten to a strong enough that I could go
00:38:38 do Death Mountain pretty easily.
00:38:39 And it was just like, oh, okay.
00:38:41 You know, as long as you just do all the easy stuff first,
00:38:44 then the other stuff's not that hard.
00:38:47 I don't know.
00:38:47 I just felt like I was waiting for that moment where it would be like,
00:38:50 you can't progress until you get good.
00:38:53 And it never really comes.
00:38:55 Yeah.
00:38:57 So, uh, so I'm reading, uh, reading Brave New World, uh, it sucks.
00:39:03 Is it verbose and boring?
00:39:05 No, it's not that it's verbose and boring.
00:39:07 It's fun and it's a rollicking thrill ride and it's fun and hilarious and good.
00:39:11 I like it a lot.
00:39:11 I'm, I'm reading it slowly.
00:39:13 It's very short book, but I'm only like a quarter of the way through it.
00:39:17 But I, I gotta say, it is so fucking corny and unsubtle and like cartoonish.
00:39:24 It is, it is a fucking.
00:39:24 Tell me about it.
00:39:25 How so?
00:39:25 It is like, it is like a caricature.
00:39:27 It is like a caricature of dystopian fiction.
00:39:30 That's the idea.
00:39:30 Yeah.
00:39:31 It's meant to be kind of parody of America.
00:39:33 Okay.
00:39:33 I should read that.
00:39:34 Well, no, no, it's like, okay.
00:39:35 Well, like I read 1984 when I was maybe like 23 or something.
00:39:41 You know, so an adult, a young adult, but an adult.
00:39:44 And I thought it was great.
00:39:45 And I loved it.
00:39:46 And, um, is it a little ridiculous?
00:39:49 Oh, maybe.
00:39:50 But, uh, it was compelling.
00:39:52 I loved it.
00:39:52 I'm reading Brave New World and Brave New World.
00:39:54 Was it ridiculous when it's our modern day?
00:39:59 It's like, it's like, they'll have like big scenes of like they're going,
00:40:03 they're going through like the human like embryo hatchery.
00:40:07 And they're like, yes, yes.
00:40:08 We breed all the embryos.
00:40:09 Yeah.
00:40:09 Yeah.
00:40:09 And here we sort them out.
00:40:10 Yep.
00:40:10 We have like a perfect system.
00:40:12 Ah, and here's where we introduce alcohol into the blood streams of the lower classes.
00:40:17 So they'll come out retarded and be incapable of doing anything.
00:40:21 Yes.
00:40:21 Society truly is wonderful.
00:40:23 Maybe there's some utility to that.
00:40:25 Like it's important to have a lower class like.
00:40:27 No, yeah.
00:40:27 That is the point.
00:40:28 That's the point in the book is that they make the lower class retarded.
00:40:32 So that they will not strive for more.
00:40:35 Like they don't understand the concept of wanting more.
00:40:38 So they just do stupid menial jobs and they literally are are like like bread and like
00:40:45 psychologically conditioned to think nothing and just straight up like be catatonic until
00:40:51 someone of a higher caste barks an order at them to do the one thing they've been conditioned
00:40:56 to derive pleasure from doing such as operating an elevator or whatever to you in concept.
00:41:02 I think that's great.
00:41:03 It's a fucking.
00:41:04 Well, I mean, it's a horrible fucking nightmarish thing to do to a person.
00:41:10 Well, yeah.
00:41:10 I mean, that's the.
00:41:11 You can make an argument for that.
00:41:12 Sure.
00:41:12 The idea though is that like this is how you would craft a society in a way where nobody's
00:41:18 nobody within the society is going to think it's bad because they are literally conditioned
00:41:23 from embryonic states to participate in it.
00:41:26 Like it's the ultimate authoritative state where nobody questions it at all because they
00:41:32 literally are controlled from birth to not question anything.
00:41:35 Right.
00:41:35 It's just built up on the back of like a baseline of like a like atrocity.
00:41:40 Right.
00:41:40 Like just the society itself to call that atrocity.
00:41:44 Yes, it fucking is.
00:41:47 All right.
00:41:47 Here's why that feels wrong.
00:41:50 Even though basically what that's what is happening is that they're rearing cattle to
00:41:54 do like a thing like cattle would rather not be eaten for me, but they don't know any better.
00:42:00 But like the thing that makes it gross and weird is that they're humans just like the
00:42:05 people at the highest state.
00:42:06 And it's it's, you know, a human is controlled getting to decide who gets to live on the lower
00:42:13 classes and who gets to live on the higher classes.
00:42:16 And that just feels unfair and uncontrollable.
00:42:19 Right.
00:42:19 I mean, I just got for sure.
00:42:20 It's only inhumane from your perspective as a as a human who values his personal freedom.
00:42:26 Sure.
00:42:26 I guess if I guess if you asked that guy, I guess if you asked one of these
00:42:31 semi morons as they're literally called in the text, I guess if you asked one of them,
00:42:36 they'd be like, yeah, it's great.
00:42:37 That's what makes it good.
00:42:38 That's why I like the book.
00:42:39 It's horrible.
00:42:40 It's horrible.
00:42:41 It but it's so cartoonishly.
00:42:42 It's so cartoonishly evil.
00:42:44 It's like, well, that's a fun of it.
00:42:45 It's like taking it to the farthest flung possible extreme because like, I mean, I don't
00:42:49 But it's so cartoonish that I can't I can't even take it seriously.
00:42:53 It doesn't feel like a meaningful satire.
00:42:55 Is there other things going on like that?
00:42:57 I mean, are there like, yeah, they're like, they're like, ah, here's the chamber.
00:43:00 You're like, they get some like, not like that low class, but like the sort of low class.
00:43:04 So like, oh, yep.
00:43:04 Here we go.
00:43:05 Some newly decanted babies.
00:43:07 Let's watch as we condition them.
00:43:09 And then they send the these newly decanted babies in and like they crawl in and they put
00:43:14 like books and flowers around and they're like, yep, here we go.
00:43:17 Yep.
00:43:18 Take find those books and flowers.
00:43:19 All right.
00:43:20 Turn on the fucking electric floor and then they like send like shock with shocks through
00:43:24 these babies and like, oh, yeah, we'll do this several thousand times.
00:43:27 And then these infant babies will learn not to read books or like nature.
00:43:31 Yeah.
00:43:31 Society truly is wonderful.
00:43:33 Hail our Ford.
00:43:35 I was like, they literally worship Henry Ford.
00:43:38 It's hilarious.
00:43:39 Yeah.
00:43:39 That's fine.
00:43:40 That's fine.
00:43:41 This sounds like the level of like cartoonish like hell scape that you would find in
00:43:47 some like doge and whether breeding.
00:43:52 The funny thing about it is that Brave New World was created by a British author who
00:43:56 like came to America and just saw the way Americans act and wanted to write a book that
00:44:00 was like his like extreme like parody version of what he thought they already were like.
00:44:06 Yeah, dude, hard to agree.
00:44:07 Like just the sheer consumerism of America and like the way that people acted.
00:44:12 He was like, this is this is a hedonistic nightmare world.
00:44:15 I'm going to write a book about it.
00:44:17 What's what's bugging what's bugging me about it is that like some of the things
00:44:22 in it are things that I think are cool.
00:44:24 Like I think that I think that everyone being hatched in an embryo hatchery would be sick.
00:44:29 But then he's got to throw in the thing about like turning some people into like more on mutants.
00:44:34 You know, I get your point on that.
00:44:36 So, you know, like this is a dystopia.
00:44:37 I just got through a part where they're like, okay, I don't really understand this part.
00:44:41 They have this slogan that's like everyone belongs to everyone else.
00:44:44 And the idea is like monogamy is considered like a sin.
00:44:47 It's like monogamy is bad and deviant.
00:44:50 Everybody posts everybody all the time.
00:44:52 Well, you're supposed to fuck everyone.
00:44:55 But it's not like you're made to do it.
00:44:57 Like because like some people are like more attractive.
00:45:00 Like you like people still get to choose who they fuck.
00:45:03 So it's like, I don't know.
00:45:06 So I don't know if it like it's presented.
00:45:09 And I think you're supposed to recoil and be like,
00:45:11 everyone's fucking so many people.
00:45:12 They don't think they don't believe in monogamy.
00:45:14 That's like, what a nightmare.
00:45:16 Am I right?
00:45:16 A world where monogamy isn't seen as like this holy to be held up in the world.
00:45:20 Again, written by a guy in like the what, the 50s or 60s who came to America in LA
00:45:27 and saw everybody fucking it was like, put his mom,
00:45:31 twitched his monocle at his head.
00:45:32 This is this is filth.
00:45:34 These Americans, well, that's what, well, that's what annoys me about it.
00:45:37 Is that this idea is presented as like, like this is so look how
00:45:41 horrible a society like this is.
00:45:42 And I'm like, well, I mean,
00:45:44 do we have to throw the baby out with the bathwater on all it?
00:45:47 Just give me my embryo hatcheries and I'll be happy.
00:45:49 Keep out the deliberate retardation stuff.
00:45:51 And you know, what's so interesting about that sort of thing is
00:45:56 that we see that that particular complaint as very dated and old fashioned.
00:46:02 And like, well, it's not even that bad.
00:46:04 But I don't think it's that old fashioned.
00:46:06 I mean, I think, I mean, I think people feel like that now.
00:46:09 I think Zoomer Zoomers love monogamy fucking perverts.
00:46:14 Well, it's it's just sort of like in the future.
00:46:18 If this was PCP episode 8000 and we like a new like N U Ben was reading the same book.
00:46:27 And he was like, you know, like having no problems with anything because that
00:46:32 there is no problem with anything.
00:46:34 Like like the cultural the culture has shifted to the point where
00:46:39 things that used to be very upsetting are no longer upsetting,
00:46:44 which is something that happens through history a lot.
00:46:47 Yeah.
00:46:47 It was like, hmm.
00:46:48 Well, that's why we have so many.
00:46:50 Oh, the world is exactly like 1984 articles because, well, yeah.
00:46:54 Yeah.
00:46:55 The stuff he was writing about is stuff that became real.
00:46:58 And like it was it was like, yeah, this this would happen.
00:47:02 And it did.
00:47:03 So here we are.
00:47:05 Well, there's a distinction to be made there.
00:47:07 I mean, at least kind of.
00:47:08 Like was the idea behind the book.
00:47:10 I don't I haven't read it.
00:47:10 I don't know the guy who read it who wrote it or anything.
00:47:12 1984 of Raveneworld.
00:47:14 I guess really both.
00:47:16 Because like are they simply.
00:47:18 I mean, I would think if I was going to sit down and be like, okay, the future,
00:47:22 I'm seeing things that could be bad.
00:47:23 So here's what I'm going to do.
00:47:24 I'm going to write a book about what I expect.
00:47:28 Like I'm seeing bad things in society.
00:47:30 I'm writing a book about the like how things could progress along that way.
00:47:33 And my goal will be to represent the future that I see
00:47:37 realistically from my perspective, but to illustrate how specifically those things
00:47:42 could be bad, which is very different from simply like imposing that and also saying
00:47:48 also people like will be evil at the same time as these things.
00:47:51 Well, it's basically it's not that it's evil.
00:47:53 It's that it's they're raised in a society with like twisted morals that makes them that way.
00:47:57 It's that the it's basically both books are slippery slope arguments.
00:48:02 It's like if we keep following the trend of thought that is carrying us in the direction
00:48:06 we're going, this is where that ends up.
00:48:09 If we, you know, if we allow that, like if we allow ourselves to be in a surveillance state
00:48:16 and constantly, you know, having the state monitor us and we become more and more comfortable
00:48:21 with it and more and more okay with it, then they will be able to impose, you know,
00:48:25 crazier and crazier shit until just a hundred years down the line.
00:48:28 It's fucking a totally different society where, you know, individual thought and freedom is
00:48:34 totally not even considered a thing you want to have, you know.
00:48:39 Right, right. Yeah, no, fair enough, fair enough.
00:48:43 I don't know. I guess I just want people to, I mean, like, for example, like on the monogamy point,
00:48:47 like I would say that I think monogamy thus far in human history has been a relatively useful
00:48:54 concept. Now, I could doubt like, I don't think that there's any moral imperative for anyone to
00:48:58 engage in it specifically. However, I would say that as society has progressed, it seems like it
00:49:03 has been relatively useful. And so like in like a Brave New World thing, I could write a book
00:49:08 about how like maybe everything else is the same, but monogamy goes away and I could potentially see
00:49:13 like how that could cause problems for society if that kept going. Well, yet to remember in Brave
00:49:17 New World, people do know the idea of family doesn't exist. All babies are born in test tubes,
00:49:23 they're all raised by the state. So like they're the only reason you fuck is just to keep your
00:49:29 stress levels down, basically. Like it's just like the reason everybody's encouraged to fuck
00:49:34 all the time is just to keep them in a good mood, essentially. Like everybody fucks all the time,
00:49:39 everybody does tons of drugs, they all fly around in private helicopters.
00:49:43 What you need is a gram of soma. Yeah, all like clothes are built to only last for like two
00:49:49 weeks so that you're constantly buying new stuff. Like it's fun about like the having to fuck all
00:49:55 the time because like if the guy right in the book didn't want to have that as a point,
00:50:02 it would make more sense for them in the test tubes to like get rid of the sex drive so that they
00:50:08 they don't need to get distracted. Maybe he thought that wasn't possible. I mean,
00:50:12 I don't know what he thought was like intrinsic to human beings and what like could be you know,
00:50:16 removed or whatever, because it sounds like he does like conditioning more than like genetic
00:50:20 manipulation. Like they give alcohol, which is like a physical substance, you know, when they're
00:50:23 young or whatever to fuck them up and then they shock them or something. I think the overall
00:50:27 like thought behind the book is basically if we had a society whose purpose first and foremost was
00:50:35 to perpetuate itself, like the only purpose of society was continued growth and continued,
00:50:41 you know, just being bigger and bigger and more and more of itself, then this is the best way,
00:50:49 like, you know, this is the most expedient way to go about that. Like this method would work
00:50:54 in theory, like the way this world is structured. It just is so repulsive to us because we look at
00:51:01 it and we go, well, this is antithetical to what we actually want out of life. So clearly,
00:51:06 you know, the, I think the reflection you're supposed to take out of that is, okay, well,
00:51:09 then maybe a society built to perpetuate itself isn't inherently a good thing and we shouldn't
00:51:15 look at our advances in the world through that lens. Maybe we should not think about, you know,
00:51:21 only how to make things more efficient, more, you know, more and more factory. What's the
00:51:26 word I'm looking for? Industrialized. Like, you know, we should take a step back and weave that
00:51:32 into our lives more carefully as opposed to plunging into it, especially in, again, the era
00:51:36 it was written where we're still in the industrial age, you know, which has kind of given way to the
00:51:41 digital age now. We, you know, we don't, we're not trying to make more and more people. We're not
00:51:46 trying, you know, the era of the baby boomer is over, but it would have been like this book would
00:51:52 have come out like when the baby boom had just happened, you know. So I think that's why like
00:51:58 the culture of America at the time did more closely resemble this. And like, you know, we always
00:52:03 talk about things like, oh, like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting as like a creepy thing,
00:52:08 you know, we look at something like Pleasantville or, or whatever, like all those fifties sitcom
00:52:13 ideas. And that stuff is creepy to us now because it is so conformist, it's so non,
00:52:20 you know, individual. No, no, people talk about Norman, when they say, oh, it's like out of a
00:52:24 Norman Rockwell painting, it's like, it's like, oh, it's like a wholesome pure. Some people say it
00:52:29 that way. Justice in the American way. Some people say it as in it's a nightmare. Like, I mean, have
00:52:33 you ever seen the movie Pleasantville? Yeah, no, but I'm familiar. It's basically about like a guy
00:52:39 who's obsessed with this fifties sitcom that's like that, you know, white picket fence traditional
00:52:43 nuclear family kind of setup. But like once they they get sucked into the show, and like once they're
00:52:48 there, they realize how that society, like all the problems with a society that functions that way.
00:52:54 Sounds like a Twilight Zone episode. I mean, not to get too into it, but like, I mean, I remember
00:52:58 reading Not to Kill a Mockingbird, what's that book with Holden Caulfield and the
00:53:03 Catcher of the Rye, I think was written specifically to show that like this Leave it to Beaver facade
00:53:08 of fifties culture was actually belying like an underlying darkness that was like more of the
00:53:13 reality. That's also what all of David Lynch's movies are about as well. Oh, yeah. But I mean,
00:53:18 doesn't Catcher of the Rye more about just like young people being like hypocrites and like it's
00:53:24 about many things like teen angst and stuff about many things. I think that that is one of the
00:53:30 things that comes along with. Yeah, okay. In any case, yeah, I think that Brave New World reflected
00:53:34 this idea of like, you know, what where the industrialization and the sort of brainwashing
00:53:40 because very much so we were being brainwashed back then like the boomer generation is a brainwash
00:53:44 generation. They were told what to buy, how to live, you know, I mean, we still are. Yeah,
00:53:51 but I think that since the sixties that like when they, you know, the hippie movement and
00:53:55 everything was about breaking away from that conditioning and like that's where alternative
00:54:00 lifestyle became a thing. And now like alternative lifestyle is, I mean, it's not even really
00:54:06 alternative anymore. It's like there's basically just multiple lifestyles you can have that are
00:54:11 all like alternative lifestyles are were just they were maybe they were a thing at some point,
00:54:17 but then they were just commodified in and of themselves and turned into that's that's good
00:54:22 to me. Like I think that that's fine because no nightmare nightmare. Well, it speaks to the fact
00:54:28 that society is a better place to live that you are not if you have an alternative lifestyle
00:54:34 instead of being killed, they just sell you shit. You know, like, I think that's a better situation
00:54:41 to be in. I mean, better than being killed. Yeah, I guess. I don't know. I don't want my
00:54:51 everything is bad once it's commodified once once it's being sold to you. I mean,
00:54:55 you got to always try to find, you know, a new way to be even more alternative. But like,
00:55:01 I think at some point, you know, if we have enough acceptance that literally no matter
00:55:08 how alternative your viewpoint is, you're being catered to, it just means that we've basically
00:55:12 achieved world peace. You are a neoliberal capitalist shill and a stooge. And how could you
00:55:21 be a neoliberal and a capitalist? Isn't that aren't they like that's the same? That's that's
00:55:26 that's what linear like neoliberalism is capitalism focused. Okay, well, what's all the
00:55:32 what's all the fucking commie shit then that's going on?
00:55:36 Oh, no, neoliberalism is like centrist liberalism. That is leftist is leftist is like,
00:55:43 like, liberal is basically like milk toast, like like everyone. Okay, I think it's used
00:55:48 differently in America. Like in America, there's like, you see the dichotomy of liberal versus
00:55:52 conservative. I think globally, liberalism is a philosophy is a basically a mostly
00:55:58 universally accepted philosophy that is pretty much just the default. And like,
00:56:03 okay, but what do we call all communism are left of that all these kids leftism all the
00:56:08 so those are just leftists. That's the only word for it. You I think you basically have to be at
00:56:13 least a socialist to be a true lefty. Okay, if you're if you're just a if you're just a garden
00:56:18 variety, but neoliberal is not the same. I just thought it meant the new left.
00:56:23 Uh, neoliberalism is well, it's the new it's the it's the new it's the mainstream. It's what
00:56:31 the mainstream left has become in in in late stage terminal capitalism. It seems to me like the
00:56:37 mainstream. Well, I don't know. I don't even know what these are just definition terms. This is
00:56:42 really boring. But I got really fucking boring. You're just talking about a definition. That's
00:56:46 all it is. Yeah, a definition. Well, it's an important definition. And we can't fuck like,
00:56:50 I'll bet there's people that don't know this. I'll bet there's people that are misused if they
00:56:54 know what a word means or not. Shut the fuck up. Did you did you didn't know what the word meant?
00:56:58 So now we can hear and argue about this all day. Or we can we can I'm not arguing. I'm giving facts
00:57:04 that were previously unknown or we can we can we can bring it back. We can go to urban dictionary
00:57:09 and we can find out for what neoliberalism is. Yeah, okay. Do you have that pulled up? I don't.
00:57:17 Let's get no and none of us do and I don't care anymore. So if anybody has anything else to
00:57:22 talk about, I've got another another concept that I just learned this last week, at least it became
00:57:27 fully clear to me that I think is real cool. And it puts a point on things. Urban dictionary,
00:57:34 neoliberalism, the belief that allowing the wealthy to extract more money from the labor of other
00:57:39 people will lead to better conditions for those people. Example, neoliberalism. This is
00:57:45 retarded. That's literally what capital. Well, it really depends on what you mean by the word
00:57:50 extract there, but I don't want to get into it. Example, neoliberalism doesn't work,
00:57:55 semi colon. The proof is all around you. Okay, so so what I learned from this is that I had
00:58:00 thought neoliberal was a buzzword that the right made up, but now I realize it's a buzzword that
00:58:06 the left made up. So either way, it's retarded. But now I know which side it comes from.
00:58:11 Well, whatever. I think we can all agree the buzzing is really annoying and I hate insects.
00:58:16 Hey, listen to this word, this phrase that I just learned a couple of days ago. It's okay,
00:58:22 it's like it's a it's from a specific field of journalism. And it's the journalistic principle
00:58:27 of minimizing harm. And I just learned what this meant. And I think you'll all agree,
00:58:32 it's a valuable thing that people who make YouTube videos and whatnot should be should be on
00:58:37 board with and I tweeted about it the other day. But basically what it is is it's well,
00:58:42 it's just not including information. Okay, when you're being a journalist, and I would argue
00:58:47 anyone who like makes a tweet is kind of being a journalist because you're making like a public
00:58:50 post about stuff. It's like, including information that is not specifically like serving the benefit
00:58:57 of the public, or like, you know, in your journalistic capacity, such as it is, doing good,
00:59:02 like for the world by publishing, like just for example, if you write a story about like,
00:59:06 this is an extreme example, or you make a tweet about like, I hate this guy so and so,
00:59:11 and you include just for a crazy example, like his name, social security number, address, phone
00:59:16 number, etc. It's like, okay, you're letting people know the information about this person who
00:59:21 maybe you hate or you think he maybe he put fucking pushed your milk at lunch or something.
00:59:26 But like, is that necessary to include? No, you're definitely doing it as a way to like,
00:59:32 give the guy harassment, or, you know, it's just not necessary. And so you're what you're not doing
00:59:37 is adhering to the principle of minimizing harm when reporting on stories like this.
00:59:42 And like, like a lot of attack videos, and like takedown and call out culture, like all the stuff
00:59:49 with like, James Charles lately, it just included like tons of and you see this on like every call
00:59:55 out video ever, there's so much information that is simply put in there to humiliate and like insults
01:00:01 and deride the person, which does not serve like what one might think of as the thesis of,
01:00:06 I don't know, so and so is a hypocrite on these specific principles for XYZ reason.
01:00:12 I agree. And I think that's a good thing to do. But in those videos, you're talking about specifically,
01:00:16 those are trying to maximize harm. Like, I mean, absolutely. Right.
01:00:20 You're absolutely right. I mean, let's not let's not pretend that YouTube is journalism.
01:00:23 Well, I mean, it's trying to say is that we need to, if we see people deliberately trying to
01:00:29 maximize harm to be not okay with that, yeah, to call out the people doing the call outs,
01:00:35 if they're being, if they're like, you know, to make it something that we bash people on
01:00:39 Twitter for, just be like, Hey, I want to put a word to it because I see people doing it and
01:00:43 it makes me upset and mad. And I didn't really know how to phrase it. But now I know, like,
01:00:48 you're trying to maximize harm to the law, like the way that the law works and how we punish people
01:00:54 is based on a principle of minimizing harm. Like, we don't like, let's say somebody murdered
01:00:59 somebody else, we don't just jump and kill that guy. We like put them through a system to figure
01:01:04 out like, okay, like, what is the minimum amount we can do to this person that is still going to,
01:01:11 you know, allow retribution, allow everybody to be sort of comfortable with the result of it,
01:01:17 you know, like, yeah, you know, maybe, maybe we could say, okay, well, you're going to present
01:01:22 professionals doing it at least, you'll go to prison for 25 years to life, you know, we'll
01:01:25 make a determination over the course of those 25 years, if you have reformed as a person and we
01:01:30 didn't have to kill you and you can continue to contribute to society, maybe you will, maybe you
01:01:34 won't. But like, that is minimizing harm in a way, it's like, it's like, we've got and it doesn't
01:01:40 do any good for the world to just hurt people over this and it drives people apart. And it's a
01:01:44 large part of like, call out cultures, cause and it's like, you got people who commit murder,
01:01:49 get like murder, like first degree intentional murder, or let's say second degree, whatever,
01:01:53 they get out of jail. And those people oftentimes are like less hated publicly than like, like,
01:01:58 you know, just James Charles for what exactly, I don't know, being slightly sexually forward with
01:02:05 some people who were not even opposed to it. And then, you know, it got debunked. I don't know,
01:02:09 I don't know who James Charles is, but can you give me like a concrete example of a violation
01:02:14 of this principle of minimizing harm? Well, I was trying to avoid it, the name. Okay. But like,
01:02:19 the one that's in mind right now is what Mr Meat Man made his video about monkey lately. And I like,
01:02:26 monkey himself even said like, I accept this is true. But when I like, I don't care what monkey
01:02:31 thinks, I think that video was so overly cruel and took the absolute worst possible interpretation
01:02:39 of every point. And I think monkey has kind of painted himself into a corner where he feels
01:02:43 like he has to just say, this is fine, because he has done things like this in the past, which I
01:02:48 whatever, not interested in discussing. But it's like, but I on the sidelines say, this is wrong.
01:02:54 I think you're going too far. This doesn't seem fair. It's overly cruel. And you're, you know,
01:02:59 not even the points are wrong, but it's the most insulting interpretation. And when you get to
01:03:04 the end of the video, and it's because he's like personally mad at monkey, it's like, well, Jesus,
01:03:09 is this really an appropriate, you know, backlash for that stuff? I don't even think it's going to
01:03:15 stick that long. But I just think it's fucked up. Well, I mean, what's the, I mean, that's not
01:03:21 journalism. That's gossip. Like the point of that video is that it's gossip. It's juicy gossip.
01:03:26 But the problem is weird. That's what it sets out to be. And that's what it does. True. But I
01:03:31 think that like gossip deserves to be mocked, not taken seriously, condemned, insulted, you know,
01:03:37 on its merits, which are none. And then like, we just be like, oh, well, yeah, this is trash.
01:03:42 But it's not treated as trash. It's treated as, wow, Mr. Medeker 2, I love this guy. Can't
01:03:47 I just subscribe for more? I mean, it's interesting because it's human drama that's actually real.
01:03:52 And we learn even more from it than watching like a show about it, you know, like that's why
01:03:58 gossip has, it has some intellectual content to it. Like, you know, there's a reason to consume it
01:04:05 as a human for, you know, self-preservational purposes. Right. But we can't just ignore like
01:04:09 all the math. And now I just have a word for what I'm seeing. Like you could make that video
01:04:13 in a way that's totally reasonable. But like what I'm seeing is a man. How could you,
01:04:17 how could you make that video in a way that's, I mean, just for example, if you would be,
01:04:23 there would be nothing to it. Maybe there shouldn't be, you know, a little baggage
01:04:27 saddled to it. A story about, I think your problem, because I think it's my problem as well,
01:04:32 is that if it was just a video where it's just like, I'm mad at X person and I'm going to fucking
01:04:38 dunk on them for 20 minutes, like not, not great, not my cup of tea, like does feel uncomfortable,
01:04:44 but understandable. The problem is a lot of these takedown videos are presented in a way that I'm
01:04:49 doing this for the greater good. Like this is a good thing I'm doing. And then they proceed to
01:04:53 like very personally attack somebody. So it's like that's trying, they're trying to make a documentary
01:04:59 about. And for the love of God, people, I'm not saying go shit on Mr. Meat Man. Could I be any
01:05:03 more fucked? I'm, that's not the point. It's a, it's a global phenomenon. I'm criticizing the
01:05:08 concept of this stuff. Jesus Christ, don't get me involved in some beef with Mr. Meat Man. I don't
01:05:13 give a fuck. But you know, you know, I'm just saying, I oppose the idea. Let me tell you,
01:05:17 this is something, something's kind of related. So I, so I'm in, I'm in sheep overs discord and
01:05:24 some people were talking about, uh, you guys remember, uh, FNGR? Of course. Yeah. That's that
01:05:29 fucking moron. Uh, well, he, he somehow. I think he still listens to the PCP. So. Hey, FNGR, you're
01:05:37 a fucking loser. Um, so he, he somehow managed to finagle. He got them, uh, the girl, uh, Lou,
01:05:45 Lou, Lou the kitty. Yes. The one, the one that, uh, the, the monkey shit. Uh, you know, uh,
01:05:50 and she got her on, he got her on stream with a bunch of people and I listened to some of it and
01:05:56 like they get her to call the cops on herself and tell, yes, and tell them, and tell them that, hey,
01:06:04 I had sex with a minor. Are you, what the fuck is that about? What kind of human being are we dealing
01:06:11 with here? Well, the thing is, uh, wait, who, FNGR? No, I'm just like, how weak willed and like,
01:06:17 weirdly. Yeah. Okay. But whatever. Go on. Go on. She seems like she's not very smart at all, but
01:06:23 also she's maybe on a bunch of medication. Well, the thing is she says that she already told like
01:06:28 her therapists and other policemen on other occasions about it. So it's, I don't, I don't get the feeling
01:06:32 that anything's actually going to happen. I mean, look, on subjects like this, do you think any of
01:06:36 those guys like give a fuck about like protecting the kids in her community? No, not at all. They
01:06:44 just want to start shit. That's, that's what I was going to say. Yeah. Yeah. They, they, they do this.
01:06:49 And then even while she's still in the call waiting for the cop to show up at the door,
01:06:53 they're like patting themselves on the back and congratulating themselves like this person is
01:06:57 a danger to the community. We did another pedo locked up. Ladies and gentlemen, we did it.
01:07:01 Ladies and gentlemen, we got him. We've saved the fucking community. We've made the world a better
01:07:05 place. All this hand wringing and stuff. And like, they're not fucking, they don't fucking care.
01:07:10 They want to feel better than someone. They want to, they want, literally it's virtue signaling.
01:07:14 Yeah. Like, okay, okay. If this person committed a crime, they should be tried, you know, as a
01:07:19 criminal. Absolutely. But that's not what they're doing. This is where I plug my other podcast,
01:07:25 Artso Farto's Whirling Dervish episode three, where I talk about all this, the gay, gay ops of
01:07:31 thrones as I call it. Oh yes. So yeah. So anyway, this, this, this was all, this was all a bunch of
01:07:36 virtue signaling, self-congratulatory horseshit, FNGR, you and your friends are fucking stupid.
01:07:42 You should die. I take no personal positions on any of this, but I mean, yeah, I mean,
01:07:46 it's, it's retarded. It's fucking, there's so much of this shit, man. I, it really, like,
01:07:51 I will never in my fucking life get involved with any of this shit. And it's such a lucrative
01:07:56 mark. And I'm not saying that like I'm tempted to, I have no desire and I never will. But like,
01:08:00 I just see the reality on the ground that all you do is you make a X person exposed video,
01:08:07 you find like the most basic, like non substantial evidence you possibly can,
01:08:11 boom, you got yourself 50,000 subs. You got a burgeoning career now. Let's go baby.
01:08:16 Well, that's the thing. Okay. This is my thing. It's, I mean, okay. Yeah. You watch the Meat Man
01:08:22 video and you come away with a sense like boy, that was some juicy gossip, but also Meat Man
01:08:28 kind of seems like a fucking loser. Like, why is he so obsessed with this?
01:08:31 Gee, you think Meat Man's a fucking loser?
01:08:33 Yeah. I mean, I think he would agree because he says he does it for like a $10 thing. It's
01:08:37 kind of silly. So I mean, I mean, he's so invested. Like he's, he like, I don't know,
01:08:42 you can tell from his voice that he's just like, he's like savoring it. He like can't
01:08:46 fucking wait to share this like delicious. He like, he can't wait to take this guy down.
01:08:51 Right. He doesn't come off very well.
01:08:52 If anybody is surprised that Mr. Meat Man is a piece of shit, you have not been paying
01:08:57 attention. Okay. Okay. So that's all fine. However, I don't know if I can blame him
01:09:04 in a, if, for like, for making the video, because you know that like he, like, you know
01:09:09 his channel grew because of it, you know, new people heard about him that never would have
01:09:12 heard about him otherwise. Like he was sitting on like this information that he made the video
01:09:16 on, he was literally sitting on a gold mine. And like, how could you expect him for like,
01:09:21 of attention, right? In the attention economy and how he would be shooting himself in the foot
01:09:25 not to make this video. So how could you expect him to do otherwise?
01:09:28 Well, I mean, I, but, I mean, in the same way I kind of expect myself not to because I didn't.
01:09:35 I mean, I've got plenty of insider. What do you mean you didn't?
01:09:37 I mean, look, I've obviously not like been friends with mum for that long, but like,
01:09:41 I have plenty of insider information. I could make some sort of exposed video,
01:09:45 but then I think to myself, oh wait, I'm not a fucking asshole scumbag. On who? On who?
01:09:49 On, look, I mean, look, theoretically on like anyone in our chat, I could like go,
01:09:53 like I'm just saying, like the possibility exists. Any of us could make exposed videos
01:09:57 on any other of us. And you know, it'd be great. If you play the gay ox of thrones,
01:10:02 you are a piece of shit. You have to accept that about yourself. And everybody needs to look at
01:10:08 it that way. Be entertained, have fun, watch people shit on each other, but know that the
01:10:13 people doing it are shit. And you are shit for participating.
01:10:15 And you're making the world a worse place. If you accept all that, I can understand that.
01:10:19 You know what? Yeah, I can agree. Like you like, like, if you're going to get in there and throw
01:10:24 shit, right? If you're if you're one of the people in there throwing shit, that's fine. Maybe
01:10:28 it's an entertaining spectacle, right? You are covered in shit. Yes. And you are remind you,
01:10:32 monkey was playing the gay ops of thrones the whole fucking time. So I don't really feel any
01:10:37 sympathy for him in this regard. Well, I mean, I feel sympathy for anyone in this situation.
01:10:41 I don't feel sympathy for anyone for basically anything. I didn't feel it about anyone involved
01:10:46 in the projared thing. I don't feel it in anything involved in this thing. Yeah, I mean,
01:10:50 he that's why he says like, he said he said in his no, he said in his response to it, like, you
01:10:56 know, if if this like, if this video were about anyone else, I would think it was funny. Yeah,
01:11:01 yeah, this this kind of thing is not exactly, but it's not okay. It's not too far away from the
01:11:06 sort of thing that monkey traffics in. But me strapped on my white knight armor. I feel like
01:11:12 yes, like there there's many people who are in the shit, they can't defend themselves because
01:11:16 they've done too much shit. We need outside heroes outside white knight, such as myself to come in
01:11:21 and police. I mean, we kind of need content cops to be like, this is fucked up, people shouldn't
01:11:26 be celebrating that this is being done. And like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what do you mean?
01:11:30 We need content cops back up a second. What are you talking about? I'm saying I'm not saying like,
01:11:33 we need YouTube to enforce what's okay. I'm saying like, I think that what I dubs did, I'm not saying
01:11:38 I dubs like a hero or anything. Wait, what did I dubs do? Well, he made a series called content
01:11:42 cop, where like, specifically what he did was he, he made videos, you know, they're just there,
01:11:46 you could call them drama videos too. But like the point of them was, and you could say he went
01:11:50 too far, so like personal stuff was included, he did not minimize harm across the board,
01:11:54 fair enough. But like, the conceit of them was to push back against practices, like Leafy did,
01:11:59 that was kind of bullying in many ways against, I don't like, you know, like Jake Paul or something,
01:12:04 I think, or no rice gum, rice gum. And again, I don't know any of the specifics. I just, I see
01:12:10 a utility of like us as a community, even age three did this like a bunch, you could say he
01:12:15 doesn't do it as much anymore. I see a, and I am not going to be the man to do it. It's not happening
01:12:20 for me, no interest. I'm not involved at all. I'm going to make funny anime videos. But like,
01:12:25 I just like it, I don't think we should just like all be like, yep, this is fine. No one's
01:12:30 being punished for this. Everything's great. It just seems, yeah, I mean, that's it, you know,
01:12:34 I feel like content was the genesis of this entire subgenre on you, you can make an argument,
01:12:40 it's propagating the cycle or is kind of a problem itself. But I don't know, like, you don't, you
01:12:45 don't have to like, epically dunk on people the way that content cop does, you can like, I don't
01:12:50 know, be a little more nuanced. I think it's what Ben is saying, though, like the more you dunk on
01:12:54 someone, the better your video is going to do. One needs to become an aesthetic and absolve
01:12:59 oneself of the pleasure of dunking on anyone and simply point out like, look, it is, it is wrong
01:13:05 to do XYZ. I'm just saying we live, listen, okay, let me, let me, let me finish this thought, just
01:13:12 give me like one minute to kind of, could kind of work this out. Like we live, you know, we're on
01:13:16 YouTube, we're in an economy where attention is the currency and like anything you can do to get
01:13:23 attention like will get you ahead, like almost like, you know, there are maybe certain kinds of
01:13:28 negative attention that might backfire on you, but like 99% of the time, there's no such thing as
01:13:33 bad publicity, anything you can get to do to do eyes on you. That's what you, that's what you
01:13:37 logically should do to get ahead and succeed. I just kind of, I feel with Nate's whole point here,
01:13:44 like on like a logical level, like an emotional moral level, I feel similarly to you, but I also
01:13:51 feel like acting on morals is no, first of all, no one's doing that at all ever. And second of all,
01:14:00 I'm not going to really hold anybody to it. Like, I mean, Nate, you, you pirate everything you consume.
01:14:09 And it's fair to criticize me on that one point. Right. And so you know that like,
01:14:15 nothing is going to compel you to even operate within your own sense of morals. Like,
01:14:22 rather than us saying like, oh, we should be looking down on people who make this type of
01:14:26 content. Yeah, we should. But like, that's who gives a fuck. Like I look down on myself for a lot
01:14:32 of things that I do, but it's not going to stop me from doing it. You know, I'm going to do what I
01:14:37 like and what, what, what favors me. So rather than that, like, you know, yeah, we could start a moral
01:14:43 crusade about it, but it's not going to, we just got to accept that we live in this fucked society.
01:14:48 Like we live in a society where this happens and this is what's going to happen because it's in the
01:14:53 nature of how people are. I just want to be clear. I mean, I don't want to get into a thing where it's
01:14:59 like, I'm not allowed, like I have identified what I think what I'm making a case for a problem with
01:15:05 our kind of ecosystem or are the people or whatever. And like, okay, there are many ways to deal it.
01:15:10 But I wouldn't want to just say like, okay, because like, I personally do other bad things,
01:15:16 like I'm not allowed to like point out or it's not valid. And I think you should, I think it's
01:15:21 fine that you're pointing it out. I think it's fine that you're trying to affect the way people
01:15:25 think about it. And maybe like, if enough people thought that this shit was not good, you know,
01:15:31 if enough people were offended at this type of content, then it wouldn't be able to,
01:15:37 you know, propagate. But like, I think that you are very much fighting the ocean on a case like
01:15:44 this. And like, on the one hand, I can say I find it immoral, but like, I also can say that I find
01:15:50 eating meat immoral, but I do it and everybody does it and I don't hold anything against anybody.
01:15:55 Like, I can think of, you know, like if you want to claim that it is moral, you'd have to do it
01:16:00 from purely like a humanist perspective, like you have to be thinking about like drawing lines
01:16:06 in the sand about whose rights matter and all that kind of stuff. And it's like, anytime we get
01:16:10 into a moral question like this, you could tunnel down forever. And like, you know, we like having
01:16:16 things like, oh, journalistic principle of minimizing harm. That's great. It sounds great.
01:16:21 But it's just something people came up with as a line in the sand. Society as a whole is always
01:16:27 going to be deciding where it wants its lines drawn. We might enter a society where people think,
01:16:33 like, if you listen to the tactics of like, you know, SJWs and stuff, I think they would be
01:16:39 very against that principle. They would be like, oh, it's all about like, if somebody does something
01:16:45 bad, then we need to, we should destroy them or, you know, right, that person needs to be excised,
01:16:50 that person needs to be punished for their behavior. And like, I think that you always fall on the
01:16:57 side of something that is more bureaucratic, something that's more stable, more logically
01:17:04 based. And the problem is that pop media is never going to operate that way. Pop media is always
01:17:12 going to operate on eyeballs. It's always going to operate on, you know, on just what gets attention.
01:17:18 And that's always going to prey on human nature and the way that we, you know, the way that we
01:17:24 socially think. And I think that this kind of drama is just so core to the way that we operate,
01:17:31 because historically, we need to know this kind of stuff. Like, at a time when we were in smaller
01:17:36 communities, if someone in your community was a piece of shit, it really mattered. It really
01:17:40 affected you. And I think people still think that way. I think we still want to know if somebody's
01:17:46 doing bad behavior, we want to know enough about them that we can, you know, first of all, make
01:17:53 it publicly known that it's not okay to be this type of person. And second of all, to avoid that
01:17:57 person in themselves. And like, I do think that, you know, epically dunking on people, yeah, it's
01:18:03 like, if we're thinking of it in terms of like, being judge, jury and executioner, it would be
01:18:08 unfair. And it certainly is. And again, there's a right way and a wrong way to do it. Just, you
01:18:12 know, one specific example that I've noticed, I've really thought about this one example is,
01:18:16 since we brought up the monkey thing, it's just that I've noticed that for a long time, we all
01:18:20 knew that monkey, like he actually, he told it, I mean, I don't mind going into a little bit of
01:18:24 detail, it's just that he told us in the past that his name was Jimmy. And now, and you know what,
01:18:27 I'm not even going to say it because I don't want to maximize harm. Jimmy is not his real name.
01:18:32 And in Meat Man's video, he goes several times, it's almost like a point where he specifically
01:18:37 states monkey's real name. And the thing about that is we know monkey doesn't want his real name
01:18:43 out there. But like Mr. Meat Man in his own way, and again, I don't care, don't involve me with him,
01:18:48 don't shit on the guy, it's just what it is. I understand the motivation behind it and whatnot.
01:18:51 I mean, do shit on the guy, but you know. Well, I mean, whatever. Just don't involve me,
01:18:56 people. I don't give a fuck. But it's like, we know he doesn't want that information out there.
01:19:01 And because sources exist on the internet, where one can find out monkey's real name,
01:19:07 like, oh, that makes it okay to make a big dunking video where we expose this information
01:19:12 that we know the person doesn't want exposed because they have been labeled bad person now
01:19:17 for X, Y, Z reasons. And this is exactly the sort of like creeping like information that that
01:19:23 person wouldn't want. And I would call it creeping like bad person behavior, where we're just like
01:19:28 we're dismissing their personhood and their desires with culture in general right now is just that
01:19:33 as soon as you make one slip up, you lose all moral consideration. And like if he comes a moral
01:19:37 imperative to destroy you in any way possible on the one specific example, like again, I follow
01:19:41 the logic, I understand why someone would feel comfortable exposing that information. But we
01:19:46 know that monkey doesn't want that. So you're making a choice to say that you're going to include
01:19:51 that. I mean, I agree that like, yeah, the way that his real name is like stated over and over
01:19:57 and over again is like seems like a deliberate sort of like attack, almost like a dehumanization
01:20:02 tactic. Here's the thing, we have like dead, like to dead name him or something. We have to ask
01:20:05 ourselves a question though. Like, because, okay, but I just, I just want to ask where is, where is
01:20:10 the line? Like, okay, like, yeah, I think that's probably passed a certain threshold. But like,
01:20:16 I don't know if you can draw like a clear threshold of like what information is acceptable
01:20:21 to share and does not cause harm and what, and what is beyond the pill, like this is
01:20:25 maximized, this is not minimizing. I would like people to at least consider that though, which
01:20:29 has not seemed to have been done in many videos. I think considering it would be great. But I do
01:20:33 think that like, the problem with this argument is that you can just tell so much of this is just
01:20:37 spite. So on the one hand, you use, you want to say like, okay, the person's right to their
01:20:43 privacy, we want to respect that. But then on the other hand, there's the people's right to public
01:20:48 dissemination of information. Like, do we not have the right to know as much as we can about the
01:20:55 world we're in and make decisions? Like, if people- Well, this is exactly what minimizing harm is about.
01:20:59 Does it serve a public good to know monkey's real name? No. I mean, I would say no, but that doesn't,
01:21:05 just because I think so doesn't mean it's true, because like, let's say that other people legitimately
01:21:09 think that he is a monster on some level. Like, they might think that they need to know this
01:21:17 information or that like, it needs to be out there so that something can be done about him.
01:21:21 Well, this is exactly why I want people to be thinking about this concept so that they can
01:21:25 forth like, you're right, every person will disagree on exactly which points are, you know,
01:21:29 on that or against that. But I would like the public to consider like, did he really like, was
01:21:35 that name really relevant? And every single person can decide whether they agree or disagree.
01:21:39 But like what I would, I mean, again, what I hope, I'll just put my position out there,
01:21:43 I would hope most people think like, you know, that really didn't need to be in there. That's
01:21:46 kind of fucked up and I'm not really supportive. I don't think that the average person who watches
01:21:51 that video is going to come away from it thinking that Mr. Meat Man was justified. I think that most
01:21:57 people watching it think this is a huge shit show and the entertainment value is in that everyone
01:22:03 involved is such a piece of shit that like, that everybody fucked up on so many levels that-
01:22:09 I just don't want a situation where we end up with an eye for the eye and, you know, just
01:22:13 everyone's fucked. Because like- Okay, okay. I just really don't think that people are coming
01:22:17 away from that video thinking that it was like a morally just thing that like, oh, we're all on
01:22:21 Mr. Meat Man's side. Even if so, the information's still out there. Well, did you, I think, I
01:22:25 disagree, unfortunately, and I don't think this is a good thing by any means, but I think a lot
01:22:31 of people probably watched that video and came away with the idea that some, that they had,
01:22:36 they had learned like a truth, like a hidden truth and that like Meat Man had done some great
01:22:40 service. Like, oh, you've opened my eyes. Like now I see the truth of the matter. Like now I can enact
01:22:46 the justice. I mean, there's always- Now I can enact the justice that is required. That's the thing.
01:22:50 Anytime we create any piece of media, a significant amount of the audience is going to be
01:22:54 fucking morons who take the wrong thing out of it. Even if it's, I mean, in this case, he wants you
01:22:59 to take something bad out of it, you know, but, but like, I don't think even the majority of people
01:23:07 watching are going to feel that way. And by the way, to anyone who's going to say that like,
01:23:07 Monkey and Meat Man are like a bond, like they're going to like do a live stream. I do not care
01:23:13 what Monkey's position is on this. I have my own moral that I'm judging by. So I'm just saying,
01:23:18 I do not find that a valid critique. Because I mean, obviously, I don't agree with Monkey's
01:23:23 stance on any of this in the first place, because that's the whole reason he got kicked out of
01:23:27 the fucking PCP. I could talk about the exact same principles on any video Monkey's ever made,
01:23:31 but that's not what we're talking about right now. So, and I don't believe in just an eye for an
01:23:35 eye. I think that's silly. I still, I still don't think we, I still don't think he did. I still
01:23:40 don't think he did anything that deserved a kick. Well, he did. That's it. What he did is exactly
01:23:44 this. What he did is that he thinks he, he didn't, he embraced this. Guys, listen, the Monkey
01:23:49 kicking thing is ancient history. Who cares? Well, I mean, we're talking about the guy anyway.
01:23:54 I mean, sure. But I'm, I'm trying to talk about the principle of, of not including unnecessary
01:24:00 detail in these dunk posts that are just designed to hurt people because I just don't think it's
01:24:04 right. And I just want people to think about this concept when they watch their exposed videos and
01:24:09 be thinking like, is this like, frankly, I want them to think, should I actually be watching this?
01:24:14 Because that's what I was thinking the whole time while I watched it.
01:24:18 The video was made. I mean, let's be honest, the video was made to cause harm.
01:24:22 Of course, obviously. If, if, if Meat Man had considered for even a second the principle of
01:24:26 minimizing harm, he wouldn't have made the video at all. And like, basically you couldn't make it,
01:24:30 you couldn't make it. Yeah. But I don't think, right? Like, yeah, I think, I don't think Meat Man
01:24:35 comes off well. I think he seems like a piece of shit. But I wouldn't say like, oh no, no one
01:24:39 should make a video like that. Like that's wrong. But you shouldn't. I mean, it's a, well, the, I'm
01:24:44 saying is you shouldn't be a piece of shit. But like, the fact of the matter is people, people
01:24:49 are going to be a piece of shit. And like, we as an audience member can, we can watch and even
01:24:54 enjoy the content and still think the guy is a piece of shit for doing. I mean, I, I just think,
01:25:00 I mean, I'm, my point is basically like, I think it's wrong, the harm that's being done
01:25:04 with the extra information that we know is not wanted to be out there. And like, you could
01:25:09 argue, I mean, it's fair to say, you know, it's human, like again, I didn't stop watching. I kept
01:25:14 watching. But like the person who has the agency in the situation, I think it's pretty clear to say
01:25:20 is the video maker. So it's just that that's where my focus goes. And I get Ben's point that it's
01:25:25 a structural thing. And you're such a, you're such a, you just, you want to come so close,
01:25:34 like you want to come so close to saying he shouldn't make the video. But then at the last
01:25:38 second you pull, oh, but I'm not saying he shouldn't have made the video, but Ben, I'll be super
01:25:41 clear. No, he should look, he should not have made it as is, because it had a lot of
01:25:46 and unnecessary information. Like I'm not going to like say, I will physically stop it was unnecessary
01:25:50 information. All of it was none of it had to be. Yeah, look, there's a version of the video that's
01:25:55 just like, like literally reporting the facts of the case as they were like, people allege this
01:26:00 and that video too, and that video too is made to cause harm because it's just gossip. I mean,
01:26:05 yeah, I mean, what am I doing wrong here? I don't think I've done anything wrong. I don't, I don't
01:26:09 think you're, I don't think you, your principle, whatever you're trying to say, like whatever
01:26:13 guideline you're trying to lay down that people should follow doesn't make any sense. It, whatever,
01:26:18 I, I think it's well, I think that basically, I think what needs to mostly arguing for is that we
01:26:24 consider it. And I think that's very fair. Like to say we should be like, if you're going to write
01:26:30 something like this, think about it. And if you're consuming something like this, think about it as
01:26:35 well. Like if you're consuming it and you see a guy who is not holding up the principle of
01:26:41 minimizing harm, criticize that, consider it to be a lesser form of journalism.
01:26:47 Like, like just, here's an example. When you got like, when you got like an angry ex-wife,
01:26:51 and let's just, or you know, let's say a guy dumps a girl, and I don't know, he, let's say he's a
01:26:55 YouTuber or something. And the girl, let's, let's say in this example, he's done nothing wrong,
01:26:59 but the girl like finds some things he's done. And I don't know, maybe she literally makes it
01:27:04 up. Let's say it's all fabricated a hundred percent, because she's decided she's an addictive,
01:27:08 so she's going to make a video about like how he dumped her, he was abusive, he's fucked up,
01:27:12 et cetera, et cetera. Things that are hard to disprove. Like really what I want is people to,
01:27:17 when that video, you know, of course gets billion million views, I want people to think about,
01:27:23 like, what are the motivations? What is the evidence here? Is it like, why was this made?
01:27:28 Should I trust this source? And blah, blah, blah, things like that. Because I'm aware of human
01:27:33 nature. That's my only point. Of course I agree with all that. Of course you should be critical
01:27:38 about the media you consume and about what people tell you. I also want to add in here that like
01:27:42 when I keep pointing out that like, monkey, you know, had this coming for doing this type of thing,
01:27:47 it's not that I'm saying an eye for an eye makes it okay. I just want to make sure we are addressing
01:27:52 the fact that monkey too should be held accountable for this, that like, this didn't just become a
01:27:58 problem when Mr. Meat Man did it to him. Monkey did this to people. He definitely did not
01:28:05 try to minimize harm about people he would talk about. He would even go so far as to,
01:28:11 you know, deliberately, like, you know, kind of give his audience an avenue whereby they could
01:28:18 fuck with somebody, you know, not necessarily urging them to do it, but making it clear how
01:28:22 they could. So I guess a lot of it's on the borderline, which is where he operated a lot of
01:28:27 the time and still does. And that's exactly why I wanted to disassociate with him at the time,
01:28:32 because I saw him as somebody who was willing to play this game, The Gay Ops of Thrones, and I
01:28:39 think that as soon as anybody is doing that, your best interest is to disassociate with that person.
01:28:44 Because, I mean, if you don't want to ride the wave and try to make it out on type, like your
01:28:48 Keemstar, you're always, you win or you die, but the game goes on forever. So if you play it long
01:28:53 enough, you know, I mean, just doing Gay Ops is in itself something that you could be like, like,
01:29:00 you might, if you get into this game thinking, oh, I haven't done anything fucked, so people aren't
01:29:06 going to find, you know, I'm not going to be uncovered. Well, the fact that you're playing
01:29:10 the game is fucked in itself. So you have already given up that moral ground. This is what I said.
01:29:16 I said, you know, yeah, you live, you live by YouTube drama, you die. On that point, as soon as
01:29:21 as meat man, again, I'm not saying to talk shit, I'm not saying to do anything to the guy for the
01:29:25 love of God, but like the second he made that video, and he's getting notoriety, like the countdown
01:29:30 on when the exposed video about him began, and it's only a matter of time, you think Mr. Meat Man
01:29:36 hasn't said fucked up things in his private chats that like, I don't know, I'm not saying monkey
01:29:40 will do anything, but that like people will have. But somebody will, because now he's a juicy target
01:29:46 for someone else to make a name for themselves. And I just think it's toxic. I don't even want
01:29:50 anything bad to happen to Meat Man. I just don't think anything should, people shouldn't do this.
01:29:54 Nate, that's all. The thing about these people, and this is also true of Mumki,
01:30:00 is that I think that a lot of them are in a very bad place in their life. They're people who have
01:30:06 low self-esteem, think that they essentially are worthless, and that the best way they can put
01:30:12 themselves up is by shitting on other people and being a piece of shit, because they think,
01:30:16 well I'm already a piece of shit, I have no worth, so I'm just going to continue to be a piece of
01:30:21 shit, right? But the thing is that that will come back to bite you one day, because unless you do
01:30:27 kill yourself, then if you ever have a peak, if you ever have a moment where you start to gain
01:30:32 something, that can now be taken from you. And for someone like Mumki, who for so long was portraying
01:30:38 himself as like, oh, I'm a piece of shit, and I don't care what happens to me. I will harm my
01:30:44 friendships, because it doesn't matter, because I'm suicidal anyways. None of this shit matters,
01:30:50 but then things started to matter, and that caught up. It's like once you've gotten to a position
01:30:55 where, oh shit, turns out I'm not horribly depressed, turns out I'm making money, turns out I'm
01:30:59 getting popular, well the seeds that you sow- But you have many enemies that you created along the
01:31:04 way, or whatever. Exactly. And so again, with someone like Mr. Meat Man, he has been continually
01:31:10 a low-level nobody, and now that he's got some attention on him- He's got like 70,000 subs,
01:31:15 but I mean- He now has a huge target on his back, you know? Now that he has-
01:31:20 I think so. Now that he's someone who's bigger than anybody who's smaller than him, who's in the
01:31:26 same position he once was, sees him as the stepping stone they can use, and it's dead easy to do,
01:31:32 and he will go from being somebody who had nothing to lose, to being somebody who has
01:31:36 something to lose, now that he has that popularity, and he can lose it. And that's why you can't
01:31:42 involve yourself in this game, because it will- This is how it happens. What goes around comes around.
01:31:49 That's true, and you know, it just reminds me of like, well a couple of- I mean on the one point,
01:31:55 I'd like to all this point, I guess people could point out fairly, like what about like the video
01:31:59 I just made recently about Zack Rittner? But I would say, I mean again, you can go into instances
01:32:04 of this shit. I would argue that I actually did think about minimizing harm as I was making that
01:32:09 video, but that guy was a absolute spammer commenter, and I think one video that is simply making fun of
01:32:15 him and telling the audience not to do anything to him is more than fair, and it was all for fun
01:32:21 anyway, and was not a big deal. But like- Okay, so I'm gonna bring this up, Ben.
01:32:28 Ben.
01:32:28 Huh.
01:32:29 How do you think that monkeys shouldn't have- didn't do anything worth of being kicked?
01:32:34 Um...
01:32:35 Oh lord.
01:32:36 I just don't think he did anything.
01:32:38 You don't think that him, after- after he was promoting and collaborating with Mr.
01:32:46 Meat Man and Cream Man when they were harassing Jesse, that wasn't grounds to be kicked?
01:32:51 Um, none of the harassment I saw, none of the- I didn't- I didn't see anything that seemed like that.
01:32:58 You didn't see it, but it happened, so if you would go and do the research or maybe come away with that-
01:33:03 Look, I've heard all the arguments, and I'm just not convinced by any of it, that any of it was-
01:33:08 that any of it was so bad that not only should a person who did- we're not even arguing that a
01:33:13 person who did this should be- but that someone who was friends with someone who did this-
01:33:16 It's not that he was friends with them, it's that he promoted them and collaborated with them,
01:33:20 and celebrated the behavior they were displaying.
01:33:22 Guys, we literally talked about this dozens of times.
01:33:25 I just- I just never saw it.
01:33:27 I just- I don't know, I've heard you-
01:33:29 We're not gonna move on our positions.
01:33:30 Jesse and everyone talk about this, and I've heard all the arguments, and none of them convinced me.
01:33:35 Well, there's really nothing more to say.
01:33:36 We've been over this so many times, you know.
01:33:40 I just don't feel bad for anyone.
01:33:42 That's all.
01:33:44 Nobody.
01:33:44 Nobody ever.
01:33:45 I mean, whatever, man.
01:33:46 For me, it is now what it always was.
01:33:48 The fact that people in this organization had major issues with Momke leaves me feeling,
01:33:54 you know, I don't feel bad that I made a business decision personally
01:33:57 to vote him out to protect the business.
01:33:59 That's what I did.
01:34:00 I bear no ill will towards anyone feeling any way.
01:34:03 Sure would be coming down on us right now if he was still around.
01:34:08 I mean, I think it'd be funny.
01:34:11 Why would it be coming down on us?
01:34:13 Because we'd be embroiled in all this.
01:34:15 Well, we didn't do anything.
01:34:16 Okay.
01:34:17 I just want to say that what Momke did, I think, was really fucking funny,
01:34:24 and I really enjoyed the video.
01:34:27 I feel like that's a position.
01:34:29 You mean like get down with the sickness as it were with the, you know?
01:34:33 Yeah, like Mr. Meat Man's video was like a horrible takedown of a horrible set of things
01:34:38 that a guy did.
01:34:40 Horrible guy.
01:34:42 Really funny.
01:34:43 I laughed the whole time and I don't feel bad about it.
01:34:47 I mean.
01:34:47 And that's my pain.
01:34:49 I mean, the problem for me is that I don't feel we got the unadulterated facts.
01:34:52 I think we got the facts as presented by the man who's currently the most mad at Momke.
01:34:56 I'll tell you right now that a few facts here or there that are not correct.
01:35:00 I mean, I, Momke did tweet and say, yes, basically.
01:35:03 I don't trust Momke.
01:35:04 I think Momke is overly protective of his reputation by going out of his way to say it's all okay.
01:35:09 I haven't watched the video, but I'll say that all of this happening has been
01:35:13 a source of many yucks for me as well.
01:35:16 And it's not that I don't.
01:35:17 Like not from a position of like, ah, ha, ha, fuck you, Momke.
01:35:20 Like, you know, I don't really, I don't have like a lot of ill will towards him or anything
01:35:26 at this point.
01:35:26 Like he's had nothing to do with me for like a year and a half, almost two years.
01:35:30 There, it is, it is, it is Juicy Goss.
01:35:33 Juicy Goss is always great.
01:35:35 And especially when it's about people, you know, people who have been like, you know,
01:35:39 for me, the sheer surrealness of watching things like this happen is an endless source of joy
01:35:45 for me.
01:35:45 Like it makes me feel like this was the point of becoming famous is that I can be surrounded
01:35:51 with so much weird shit all the time that like people who've been to my house now have
01:35:57 like a fucking, you know, news articles written about them and they're in discretions.
01:36:01 Like, you know, all these weird historical anecdotes that all feed into each other.
01:36:06 And I'm in the middle of this whirlwind looking at all the stuff and going,
01:36:08 this is fucking insane.
01:36:09 This is awesome.
01:36:10 Maybe the difference for me is purely that this all makes me extremely uncomfortable to
01:36:14 be anywhere near me and I want nothing more than to be as far away from it as possible.
01:36:19 Like I feel uncomfortable talking about it because I don't know, like I,
01:36:23 a lot of the time I have like half opinions about certain things and half about other things.
01:36:27 And I don't want to be like seen or heard saying something that I'll later say,
01:36:31 actually, I don't know about that thought.
01:36:33 But then you saying you're like, you brought this whole thing up or like you went into it
01:36:38 quite a lot.
01:36:39 Well, I mean, I didn't want to talk about it.
01:36:41 I mean, I accept responsibility of broaching the topic at all.
01:36:44 But it was not my goal to get into any specific.
01:36:47 I like talking about all this stuff because you can't run away from this.
01:36:50 This is the world we live in.
01:36:51 These are the people we're surrounded with.
01:36:53 Well, I'm trying to be proactive and just get people to absorb this in a way that I
01:36:57 think is more healthy.
01:36:58 That's all.
01:36:58 I think that's good.
01:36:59 I like that you do that.
01:37:00 I think it'd be weird.
01:37:01 I think it'd be weird if we didn't talk about it.
01:37:03 It'd be like John and Aaron not talking about why the Game Grumps broke up.
01:37:06 I mean, that's how I felt because inevitably people are asking me about
01:37:10 monkey and it's like, I don't have such strong opinions that I'm going to like go
01:37:14 and make a video about it.
01:37:16 And I also don't want to individually respond to everybody on Twitter about it.
01:37:19 But it's like, if I have thoughts about it as I have on this podcast, like, yeah,
01:37:23 I think it would be weirder of me to just keep my mouth shut.
01:37:26 And it's like, whatever.
01:37:28 I used to think that I think that the era of trying to keep things private is just gone.
01:37:36 And that's for better or worse.
01:37:38 There's problems with it.
01:37:39 There's ups and downs.
01:37:41 But I've accepted the idea that we're just not in a private society anymore.
01:37:47 It's not the way that enough people want to operate for it to be the case.
01:37:51 And that's always the way.
01:37:52 Well, not if you're online, right?
01:37:53 Right.
01:37:54 Like, not if you're online.
01:37:54 But everybody's online at this point.
01:37:56 Even if you're not online, people could just come to your house.
01:37:58 I mean, not your house, but like, I don't know, take a picture of you in public,
01:38:00 tweet it, get it going if they want to.
01:38:03 It's like there was a brief period where I was kind of trying to run away a little bit from it
01:38:09 because it was like, and I don't want to always be like a public figure who says
01:38:14 absolutely everything going on in my life because it's unnecessary.
01:38:17 But it's like, if people are going to know things about me, that's going to happen.
01:38:22 There's too much information going around at all times.
01:38:25 Too much surveillance happening.
01:38:26 You're right, Digi.
01:38:27 I understand this idea that like privacy is dead.
01:38:29 It's just that, OK, when I look at this thing, what I see
01:38:33 is a gossip to me is a chain with a series of links.
01:38:37 And it's like infinitely long.
01:38:39 And it actually branches out.
01:38:40 The links connect to different.
01:38:41 It's like a net.
01:38:42 That's what makes it so interesting.
01:38:43 It starts at one point.
01:38:44 That's why it's so fun to watch.
01:38:47 I mean, that's fair.
01:38:48 That's fair.
01:38:48 But what I perceive is that at every single link, every one of us is an individual link
01:38:52 in that chain that can branch out infinitely.
01:38:55 And like, I think at every one of those junctures,
01:38:58 it's reasonable to just say like every person bears some responsibility when it comes to like
01:39:03 propagating misinformation or, you know, if anybody who is watching this content,
01:39:08 anybody who's participating in any way, you are a part of it now.
01:39:12 And your decisions are going to matter and you're going to be held accountable.
01:39:14 Including just watching it.
01:39:15 And you are not a private person.
01:39:18 You are no more so a private.
01:39:20 Like people always say, oh, well, he's a he's a public person, so it's different.
01:39:24 Motherfucker, you are all public people.
01:39:27 If you have an account on the internet and you're tweeting anything,
01:39:31 if you're posting comments on YouTube threads, you are creating content.
01:39:35 You are putting yourself in the public eye.
01:39:37 That just reinforces my my thing.
01:39:39 I started this whole thing off with like every tweet is a little journalistic activity,
01:39:43 which is why I feel comfortable bringing up the standard as, you know, related to it.
01:39:46 And like, look, if you want to be private, like, first of all,
01:39:50 the government system is not currently really protecting your privacy.
01:39:54 If anything, they're breaching it even harder than we are because they're getting their
01:39:58 tendrils into things you aren't even trying to publicly state.
01:40:01 So probably don't have the state on your side.
01:40:03 If you want to protect your privacy, it's on you.
01:40:05 If you don't want people to know about you, you don't tweet.
01:40:09 You don't go online.
01:40:11 You don't post your information because at this point, nobody,
01:40:15 no part of the social structure is trying to protect your privacy.
01:40:19 So the second you start participating in the game, just know you are a participant.
01:40:23 Expect to be held accountable for your actions.
01:40:26 I guess so.
01:40:27 I guess so.
01:40:28 Just remember, people, you can make choices.
01:40:30 You don't have to share that video.
01:40:32 If you think it's kind of fucked up what somebody did, you don't have to watch it.
01:40:35 And I'm aware we're humans.
01:40:36 We're going to be weak.
01:40:37 I watched it too.
01:40:38 So I'm part of the problem, 100% true.
01:40:40 You know, you don't have to bring it up on this podcast and make it a big deal among all your friends.
01:40:46 I did not watch it because I didn't want to have to hear that sniveling retard's voice for 45 minutes.
01:40:52 Oh, Mr. Meat Man.
01:40:54 I like it.
01:40:54 I do like his delivery.
01:40:56 Lol.
01:40:56 I laugh whenever he says his own name.
01:40:58 I laugh.
01:40:59 I clap.
01:40:59 I am a chimp.
01:41:02 I am a chimp with a lizard brain.
01:41:05 Yep.
01:41:05 He's got some serious branding going on.
01:41:07 We should go to voicemails because it's an hour.
01:41:10 It's going to be the Microsoft press conference.
01:41:12 And I got to watch the Halo Infinite reveal.
01:41:14 Oh, I see.
01:41:15 But were you going to say something first?
01:41:18 I had one more small thing to mention, which may or not branch off into a topic.
01:41:24 But I've got this app called Duolingo, which is a language learning app.
01:41:31 And I'm learning Hebrew for no reason.
01:41:34 Huh.
01:41:34 Whoa.
01:41:35 Why?
01:41:36 Why Hebrew?
01:41:37 I mean, I know you said for no reason, but why?
01:41:40 Well, the reason was I wanted to learn Arabic, but they didn't have it.
01:41:44 And that was the closest thing.
01:41:46 Hmm.
01:41:46 Because I'm thinking like...
01:41:49 Yeah.
01:41:49 Well, yeah.
01:41:50 I mean, that's the thing.
01:41:51 That's the thing I've been thinking is that culturally, in the West,
01:41:57 the whole Middle East is seen as the enemy.
01:42:01 Just in general, for your basic Joe Shmo who's like,
01:42:05 duh, he'll say, fuck those Muslim people.
01:42:10 I guess.
01:42:11 Yeah, it's true.
01:42:12 I do say that all the time.
01:42:14 Yeah, and it's like, there's this sort of demonization of that whole area of the world.
01:42:19 I kind of like the things over there.
01:42:23 And it's kind of a shame.
01:42:24 Like, if I, as a white man...
01:42:25 Why not Arabic?
01:42:26 I'd get shifty eyes.
01:42:27 There's a lot more Arabic speakers.
01:42:28 They said there was no Arabic on Duolingo.
01:42:31 Oh, okay, sorry.
01:42:32 I see, I get.
01:42:32 Yeah, there's no Arabic on Duolingo.
01:42:35 I don't know why.
01:42:36 Because of racism, god damn it, they hate them.
01:42:38 Yeah.
01:42:39 I mean, I would look for a thing, but learning Hebrew is good enough.
01:42:42 Yeah.
01:42:42 There's a Hebrew guy.
01:42:44 There's a guy who lives in the Israeli army in my Discord who talks about stuff.
01:42:50 That's cool.
01:42:50 And so, I'll be able to say, hello, I have the bread.
01:42:54 Like, I'll be able to say that soon.
01:42:56 You'll need a new keyboard.
01:42:58 Oh, I will.
01:42:59 Well, there's a Hebrew keyboard.
01:43:00 Duolingo is such a gamified version of learning.
01:43:05 That sounds good.
01:43:08 Basically, it doesn't give you a course that you have to memorize in a test.
01:43:13 They just give you questions.
01:43:14 Some of them are like, a guy speaks and you have to put the right letters in the right words
01:43:20 from a choice.
01:43:22 Sometimes there's like a word in a sentence that you have to do.
01:43:24 Sometimes there's a sentence you have to translate into English.
01:43:28 And a lot of it is like, you can infer based on what ones you've seen.
01:43:34 Like, there are different categories.
01:43:35 Like, the first three sections are like just words, simple words.
01:43:40 Like, mother, father, love, and stuff.
01:43:44 And then you go further down.
01:43:45 Once you've unlocked more complex systems like adjectives and concepts and greetings and stuff,
01:43:54 you click on one of those.
01:43:55 You do a lesson.
01:43:56 And it's basically like a 10 minute, like you're given like 10 to 20 questions.
01:44:01 And if you get it right, it's a little ding.
01:44:04 And if you get it wrong, there's a like, and then it comes back around.
01:44:07 And you can't complete the thing until you've got all of them right.
01:44:11 So if you're stuck on one, it's not like you will never learn it.
01:44:14 It will, you'll eventually like understand, like it'll show you what the answer is.
01:44:19 So you get it wrong.
01:44:20 And then you're like, oh, wait, that one, it means that.
01:44:23 So you through like trial and error, and how like language is more fun to learn, I find,
01:44:32 is that you come up with your own associations with the words and the symbols.
01:44:38 Of the other language.
01:44:39 So I'm recognizing without even really trying
01:44:43 words that, you know, in Hebrew and like the male and female versions of certain words,
01:44:49 I'm like, oh, that squeaky line means that I don't know what any of the letters are,
01:44:52 but I do know how to read certain sentences with, you know, like I've only been doing it
01:44:58 for a week and I can, I can recognize quite a few and it's, it's pretty cool.
01:45:02 That's interesting.
01:45:02 The way it's, the way it's structured.
01:45:04 That's cool.
01:45:04 I use something called.
01:45:05 It's also a free app.
01:45:06 So you may as well, if you, if you ever felt like learning a thing, it could be,
01:45:10 it could be a good like starting point, at least for reading.
01:45:13 I've used something called memorize for the last while, which sounds very similar.
01:45:17 It's sort of a gamified and obviously I use it for Japanese.
01:45:20 And I've been pretty lazy the last while, but I actually, I have been taking more steps
01:45:24 to just expose myself to more Japanese on a daily basis.
01:45:27 I actually, for multiple reasons, because I didn't want to deal with just like news
01:45:30 on Twitter and shit.
01:45:31 I just wanted the people I subscribed to and that's it.
01:45:33 So I, I set my Twitter feed to just be as if I was in Japan.
01:45:37 So I just get like all these updates that are just like pure Japanese shit.
01:45:41 And mostly it's in, it's in kanji a lot, so I can't really understand it,
01:45:44 but it just like from my recent dabblings into learning Japanese, everyone's been telling me
01:45:48 exposure on a daily basis, total exposure is the best way to go, but the more the better.
01:45:54 Well, that's how, well that's how Bart, well that's how Bart Simpson learned to speak French.
01:45:57 Indeed.
01:45:57 Indeed.
01:45:58 Yeah, the thing that encourages you.
01:46:01 Oh, that's actually a good thing people do.
01:46:03 They read Shonen manga because it's very simple.
01:46:05 It's for elementary school kids.
01:46:07 The people read that raw.
01:46:08 So eventually I will do that for sure.
01:46:10 Yeah, the Duolingo app has a lot of bells and whistles and jingling, jangling things,
01:46:15 dangling in front of your, in front of your face, such as streaks and getting bonus.
01:46:20 Yeah, same with memorize.
01:46:22 That you can, you can spend on customizing the owl.
01:46:24 Mine actually does cost money though, I think.
01:46:26 So yours is probably much smarter to use.
01:46:29 The only thing is like after you complete a lesson, there's like a little ad and you say
01:46:33 no thanks.
01:46:34 Oh yeah.
01:46:35 I don't want to subscribe, but it really hasn't become a problem and I just do it every night
01:46:39 before I go to bed.
01:46:40 Like, oh yeah, I want to keep my streak going.
01:46:42 Smart, that's very smart.
01:46:42 For no real reason, because the current, the virtual currency is pointless and I don't care
01:46:47 about spending on anything, but I do like having gems and numbers going up.
01:46:50 So like every night, every night before I go to bed, instead of, instead of watching another
01:46:55 45 minute YouTube video, I do some Hebrew learning and then I go to bed.
01:46:59 And I feel like, I feel like that's actually quite a good way to get the knowledge.
01:47:04 I don't think I'll ever use Hebrew, but it's just nice.
01:47:07 Oh, you're going to use it when they take over my dude.
01:47:09 It's going to be exclusive, but we're all using one of these days.
01:47:14 All right, let's hear some voicemails.
01:47:15 But yeah.
01:47:16 Yeah, all right.
01:47:17 That's cool.
01:47:17 Let's go to voicemails.
01:47:18 I'm ready.
01:47:19 Oh, hey, first of all, we got a little PCP theme.
01:47:22 So let's ramp it up while I play this PCP theme.
01:47:25 Go.
01:47:25 It's coming.
01:47:26 It's coming.
01:47:27 I know the theme contest is months gone, but I just want to do this rendition of the
01:47:34 original theme and then you guys will be like, yeah, that's cool.
01:47:39 We'll see about that.
01:47:47 Cool.
01:47:49 Hey, it's cool.
01:47:50 Yeah, I like it.
01:47:51 Okay, so next one while he's playing us in.
01:47:55 Okay.
01:47:56 I mean, I'm just letting, that's just background noise.
01:47:58 Yeah, let them do his thing.
01:47:59 So our first voicemail is from Dynamax Tortera Detective Pikachu.
01:48:04 I wish he recorded that.
01:48:05 All right, I'm just going to play it and I hope it stops the one that's playing now.
01:48:08 Okay, here we go.
01:48:08 Go.
01:48:09 I would just like to point out something real fucking quick.
01:48:11 All right.
01:48:12 You know, this is Dynamax.
01:48:13 It's the same guy.
01:48:14 Maybe.
01:48:16 And you know, Detective Pikachu, the movie.
01:48:19 Well, the fucking, the torteras.
01:48:21 Oh shit, you're right.
01:48:22 They were giant and no one's talking about it.
01:48:25 What?
01:48:25 They totally teased that shit.
01:48:26 The torteras are really big in the movie.
01:48:28 That's all I got to say.
01:48:29 Okay, so in Detective Pikachu, they had really big torteras.
01:48:31 I didn't see it.
01:48:33 Okay, does that mean that in Gen 1, with the anime, when we saw that giant
01:48:38 dragonite, well the giant dragonite or tentacle, was that Dynamaxed to my dude?
01:48:44 Makes sense to me.
01:48:44 Do you remember that episode with the giant Gengar and the giant Alakazam?
01:48:48 Yes.
01:48:48 Yes, I do.
01:48:49 The ancient Pokemon.
01:48:51 I remember the giant, I remember the giant Haunter from Electric Tale of Pikachu.
01:48:56 Yeah, was it giant?
01:48:57 The good series, the good manga series.
01:49:00 True, true.
01:49:02 Okay, anyway, shit voicemail.
01:49:04 Thanks for nothing.
01:49:05 I remember the Dynamaxed human beings from One Piece.
01:49:09 Oh yeah, remember that time that in one, in a filler anime of One Piece.
01:49:13 How do I end up with Nate, who is the one who screens the voicemail, playing a voicemail
01:49:18 going, wow, that was a shit voicemail.
01:49:19 Didn't you screen the voicemails?
01:49:21 Me shitting on it is part of the joke, did you?
01:49:24 This is high level stuff.
01:49:25 Nate's criteria is...
01:49:26 So Nate deliberately includes shitty voicemails, so he can shit on them.
01:49:31 I included that one so I could make the rebuttal about the huge dragonite.
01:49:34 That was my sole desire, that's why I included that.
01:49:37 By the way, okay, we gotta put out a message to our boy RiddlemyassBatman.
01:49:42 Okay, which is just that, he's been calling in, leaving a bunch of like,
01:49:46 I'm Batman, why aren't you playing my voicemail?
01:49:49 Listen, buddy, you gotta get it together.
01:49:52 We can't just be playing this stuff that's like, why aren't I on the voicemails?
01:49:56 And there's a surprisingly large number of people
01:49:58 who are calling in with this exact same complaint.
01:50:01 So people, every time you call in, it's judged on merit and nothing else.
01:50:05 Just be funny, if you don't get in, that means it was not funny enough,
01:50:09 and there's nothing else to be said.
01:50:11 So just be funny.
01:50:12 Unless Nate needs to make a point about dragonite, in which case...
01:50:15 That's correct, that's the one time that you'll get in.
01:50:18 Think about what opportunities can I give Nate to say things
01:50:22 and build your voicemail around that.
01:50:26 Pretty much, pretty much.
01:50:27 That's the key, yeah.
01:50:28 But also, don't make it too much about me,
01:50:30 because I deliberately avoid some that are like, this is for Nate.
01:50:32 I'm like, that's too many of those, we're out of here.
01:50:35 So it's a delicate balance, good luck.
01:50:38 Okay, let's move on.
01:50:39 Next one's from Garrett, the microbiology student.
01:50:42 Okay, good, good.
01:50:43 Oh wait, go, yes, here we go.
01:50:44 This voicemail is in regards to Nate's poopy autism question about his poopy autism.
01:50:53 It's not really about me though.
01:50:54 And why he has to eat the shit from normies to care his autism.
01:51:00 Eat shit, right.
01:51:01 And the reason why you have to eat the shit is because the bacteria in your gut is anaerobic,
01:51:09 so it won't survive in an atmosphere with oxygen, which basically means you can't grow
01:51:16 any of that bacteria on a petri dish without like a fuck ton of work.
01:51:21 So it ends up being a ton cheaper and easier to just wash out the shit a bit
01:51:27 and then put it in a pill that you can eat.
01:51:32 Hell yeah.
01:51:33 That's a pretty reasonable point, I just thought that was an interesting.
01:51:35 Small follow up on that.
01:51:36 There's been an article written on the Aspergian website about autism, I guess.
01:51:44 Where basically they called into question.
01:51:45 Really, that's what it's called?
01:51:47 They called into question the study.
01:51:49 Apparently the study is just, while it is interesting what findings it has,
01:51:53 it had like no control group.
01:51:56 They didn't really factor in a lot of different elements of what could have caused the change
01:52:01 other than the shit pills.
01:52:02 Shockingly, it wasn't the most professional study ever done.
01:52:05 It wasn't a great study, but there could be more studies done to eventually get more info on.
01:52:10 On the one hand, of course, but on the other hand, am I really going to trust a website
01:52:15 called the Aspergian on it to report accurately on how they're about to destroy their business?
01:52:20 I mean, I think we're all winners here for just having heard a story about children being fed.
01:52:25 Oh yeah, it's very true.
01:52:26 I didn't share all this because I legitimately thought.
01:52:29 Shit and die is real now.
01:52:31 Yeah, all right, that's enough.
01:52:33 Okay, all right, let's go on to the next one.
01:52:35 That's the new tagline, autism, eat shit and die.
01:52:39 All right, this is from your average passive listener.
01:52:42 Okay, go.
01:52:43 You guys were talking about having kids last week,
01:52:45 and it was basically talking about symbolic immortality,
01:52:48 a psychological term coined by Robert J. Lifton.
01:52:51 We all naturally strive for it because we're fear of death.
01:52:54 There's four categories, biological, children, afterlife, religion, natural,
01:53:00 trees, and the good shit, creative immortality.
01:53:03 I think all artists have that little comfort inside them
01:53:06 that at least something will still be there after they're dead.
01:53:09 Like this voicemail, for example.
01:53:11 I think I need a question.
01:53:12 So is anyone religious in the PCP?
01:53:14 And no matter the answer, how does religion influence religion?
01:53:16 Is anyone religious?
01:53:17 First of all, you don't necessarily need a question if your point is just good.
01:53:20 I mean, I'll be interested to hear it.
01:53:24 Yeah, it's a voicemail.
01:53:25 It's an order of voice question.
01:53:26 Yeah, I mean, yeah.
01:53:27 I don't think any of us are religious.
01:53:29 I think literally none of us have any religious inclination whatsoever.
01:53:32 Well, no, he asked how his religion affected your child.
01:53:36 Oh, true.
01:53:37 I was raised hardcore Catholic, so.
01:53:39 Yeah, yeah.
01:53:40 Like church every week until I was 16.
01:53:42 Wasn't there like a hardcore anti-religion PCP or Let's Play?
01:53:47 I don't know if it ever got released, though.
01:53:49 What?
01:53:49 No, well, we did a religion cast,
01:53:52 which I think was a lot of dunking on religion in general.
01:53:55 Yeah, but like at that point too, I think you and Davoo
01:53:59 and somebody else did like a long Let's Play
01:54:02 where you were just like talking about your upbringings with religion.
01:54:06 But I don't think it got released.
01:54:07 I think it was.
01:54:08 I think like the files were corrupted or something.
01:54:11 Yeah, I don't know.
01:54:11 I don't remember.
01:54:12 God, God wasn't having that one.
01:54:14 I'll say that I don't think personally for me,
01:54:16 I was raised generally religious.
01:54:18 We went to church every Sunday for a long while.
01:54:21 I don't think it had any particular like exceptionally bad effects on me
01:54:25 because I actually, despite, I'm going to say anti-theist,
01:54:28 I think it is bad for the world that people believe in religion.
01:54:32 I'm not saying that I necessarily know like the solution, but.
01:54:36 We went to church.
01:54:37 It was fine.
01:54:39 Nothing interesting to say on this topic.
01:54:41 Let's play the next question.
01:54:42 Okay, but that was only his final question, which was shit.
01:54:44 His main point about, oh, living forever.
01:54:48 Now on that, I want to say something.
01:54:49 Simbolic immortality.
01:54:51 Simbolic immortality.
01:54:52 I think if you're making videos,
01:54:54 then that's like one of the most volatile
01:54:56 and will probably dissolve quickly.
01:54:58 Yeah. I mean, how long until the server farms
01:55:00 are all destroyed by aliens or something?
01:55:02 I mean, they're not going to last that long.
01:55:04 I don't know. People need to keep up.
01:55:05 Actually, is anything digital is the same?
01:55:07 Kind of.
01:55:08 So it just depends on how long the internet survives.
01:55:09 I mean, anything material is the same, right?
01:55:12 Yeah.
01:55:12 There's no material that doesn't erode.
01:55:14 Yeah, but a bronze statue lasts longer than a bronze vinyl record.
01:55:19 I mean, true.
01:55:21 To this guy's point, though,
01:55:22 he said like artists are comforted
01:55:24 by the thought that their works will outweigh them.
01:55:26 But like, I mean, to an extent, share.
01:55:30 That's true for me. That's absolutely, I'm in this category.
01:55:32 Well, I mean, I get consumed by the long-term thought of,
01:55:35 I mean, I guess as Gabe was saying,
01:55:36 it's like, I'm thinking long-term,
01:55:38 like nothing of me will exist in a thousand years.
01:55:41 And that makes me kind of upset that like,
01:55:43 oh, I'm going to be completely forgotten.
01:55:45 100% chance.
01:55:47 Like people like Elon Musk might be remembered
01:55:49 if they colonize Mars successfully or something,
01:55:52 even if they just get it started.
01:55:53 But like, you guys are all, you're all,
01:55:55 you're all worried about nothing.
01:55:57 Look, it's the year is 2019.
01:55:58 Transhumanism.
01:55:59 The night, it's 2019.
01:56:00 So we have, we have eight years before 2027 hits
01:56:03 and Deus Ex happens, canon.
01:56:05 And we're all.
01:56:06 Oh yeah, it's canon.
01:56:07 Oh, I hope you're right.
01:56:08 That's true.
01:56:08 Oh, I hope you're right.
01:56:10 Oh, I'm praying for it.
01:56:10 I'm praying to the digital God.
01:56:12 I think that, you know, on Krypton in Superman lore,
01:56:16 incidentally, I think that those people had obtained
01:56:19 like scientific functional immortality.
01:56:21 And like the reason that Krypton went to shit
01:56:23 was because everyone was immortal, nothing changed.
01:56:25 And I'm just saying, if we get a more immortality,
01:56:27 I can see that happening in humanity.
01:56:29 And we all just eventually like just die out.
01:56:30 Well, all of a sudden we get firmware updates,
01:56:32 you know, we'll be on human OS 13.
01:56:34 I guess so.
01:56:34 And we'll finally get dark mode
01:56:35 and the black people will come back.
01:56:39 Okay, all right, let's go to the next one.
01:56:40 How many of these do we have?
01:56:41 I have to piss again.
01:56:42 I think there's three more.
01:56:43 No, four more, four more.
01:56:44 I can stand that, I guess.
01:56:46 This is I'll Die Bought on porn and dark souls.
01:56:49 So let's see what they have to say for us.
01:56:51 Go.
01:56:52 Hey, hooting up.
01:56:53 I'll die corporation voicemail bot.
01:56:59 The landscape of one sexuality
01:57:01 has better nonlinear level design than dark souls.
01:57:03 You start going down whatever avenues
01:57:05 are immediately apparent
01:57:06 until they suddenly interconnect
01:57:07 in ways you never expected,
01:57:08 eventually elucidating that it is all
01:57:10 a manifestation of something else
01:57:12 deep inside you wanting to be expressed
01:57:14 in the same way that the kiln of the first flame
01:57:16 was deep below the same fire
01:57:17 like shrine you always called home.
01:57:19 In other words,
01:57:20 there's no reason to beat your meat
01:57:21 when beating dark souls
01:57:22 has already given you all the same pleasures.
01:57:25 Shutting down, I'll die corporation voicemail bot.
01:57:28 That was incredible.
01:57:29 Thank you, I'll die corporation bot.
01:57:31 I love it and I want more.
01:57:33 Yeah, keep it going.
01:57:34 He's been doing it for a while or she,
01:57:36 I don't know.
01:57:36 Yeah, those are great.
01:57:38 Whatever algorithm is producing these voicemails.
01:57:41 Indeed, pretty advanced.
01:57:42 Okay, we've got white,
01:57:44 I think it's from Wike, W-E-I-C-H.
01:57:46 White, the professional furry.
01:57:49 Okay, and here we go.
01:57:50 Go.
01:57:51 Okay, now as a real furry,
01:57:53 let me lay down the law on who is
01:57:55 and is not a furry,
01:57:57 because I have authority.
01:57:58 Oh, we definitely got a furry voice.
01:57:59 Super furry voice.
01:58:01 And you just are a furry,
01:58:02 there's no denying it.
01:58:03 If anyone disagrees, shut up.
01:58:05 Now, the interesting thing is people
01:58:07 who may not say they are,
01:58:09 but have varying degrees of deniability
01:58:11 in that claim.
01:58:12 If you just kind of look at furry art,
01:58:14 but have no real participation in the community,
01:58:16 even if you have some inclinations
01:58:18 with your art consumption,
01:58:20 then you're not really a furry unless you say so.
01:58:22 But if you participate in furry communities,
01:58:25 like if you make furry art
01:58:26 or you talk to other furry community members as in equal,
01:58:31 now you kind of are a furry,
01:58:33 even if you don't have a fursona, pretty much.
01:58:35 You're maybe like diet furry.
01:58:38 But if you have a fursona,
01:58:40 pretty much in any capacity whatsoever,
01:58:43 especially if you call it a fursona,
01:58:45 then you just are a furry.
01:58:47 And if you say you aren't,
01:58:48 then you are not only a furry,
01:58:50 but you're also a liar, liar, liar, fur on fire.
01:58:54 I want to make an addendum to this.
01:58:57 It's unrelated about furry as an art style.
01:59:01 If you say furry is an art style,
01:59:02 that is literally the exact same thing
01:59:04 as saying anime is an art style.
01:59:07 Which is not that unfair.
01:59:08 Make that statement what you will, digi bro.
01:59:11 Yeah, I mean, it's not like anime
01:59:13 is overwhelmingly pretty similar.
01:59:17 If somebody said that as if it were objectively true,
01:59:20 I'd be like, no, there's a lot of exceptions.
01:59:23 But as a generalization, yeah,
01:59:25 anime tends to look a certain way.
01:59:27 It's very easy to identify.
01:59:30 Furry is the same way.
01:59:31 What about avatar?
01:59:32 I'm so confused.
01:59:33 They're a sort of a cut.
01:59:35 You could probably break down,
01:59:36 and maybe someone should.
01:59:38 There are probably schools of furry art.
01:59:40 Sure, at least.
01:59:41 There are a couple of different looks that it can add.
01:59:44 Just like there are schools of furry voices.
01:59:46 There's like a more anime-ish look.
01:59:48 There's like a more Disney-ish look.
01:59:50 There's probably others.
01:59:52 I mean, I feel like the reason
01:59:55 the furry art style rubs me the wrong way
01:59:57 is because I think of that as like,
02:00:00 oh, it's an animal, but as a human,
02:00:02 which is just like a type of thing.
02:00:04 It's like saying there's a boat art style.
02:00:06 Like there's an art style for drawing a boat.
02:00:09 All boat art style is the same, generally.
02:00:12 And I'm like, yeah, but you can paint a picture of a boat
02:00:14 and you can cray on a boat,
02:00:15 and you can draw a difference.
02:00:17 You do a 3D boat.
02:00:18 Abstract.
02:00:19 Well, yeah.
02:00:19 There's so many different ways to do it.
02:00:20 But what if culturally...
02:00:21 Calling it an art style is...
02:00:22 Well, hold on.
02:00:24 Yeah, I know that boats is not culturally similar.
02:00:27 No, no, but what if culturally,
02:00:29 people tended to draw boats
02:00:31 in a couple of broadly similar ways,
02:00:33 which is kind of how it is with furry art?
02:00:35 It's kind of like with the masculine and feminine.
02:00:38 I would argue that, sure,
02:00:39 there's a binary of people who fall in the spectrum,
02:00:41 but I think we can identify two focal points
02:00:44 of femininity generally exists
02:00:46 and masculinity generally exists.
02:00:48 And I think that the substantive arguments
02:00:50 are like, does that justify calling it there
02:00:53 because there's so much gray area?
02:00:54 I would argue, yes, in the same way
02:00:56 I would argue there is a furry art style,
02:00:58 but I get why people say no.
02:00:59 I don't think there's one furry art style.
02:01:02 I think there are furry art style.
02:01:04 It just calls on me to...
02:01:06 It feels like a challenge to draw an anthropomorphized animal
02:01:10 in a way that is in no way similar to any furry art style
02:01:14 and then have someone say,
02:01:15 oh, it's a furry art style when it's like some strange Picasso thing.
02:01:21 It feels like reductive of what art style is.
02:01:25 I definitely think it's possible to draw anthroanimals
02:01:28 and not have a furry art style,
02:01:29 but when I see furry art, I feel like I know it immediately.
02:01:33 Just like the voice, which is now...
02:01:35 That's now what I'm going on.
02:01:37 Like, fuck any other data.
02:01:39 If I hear the voice, I know you're a furry.
02:01:41 That's now my entire basis.
02:01:44 I guess we're talking about the art though.
02:01:45 Look at salazzle.
02:01:46 Like, okay, I feel like through the eyes of a furry,
02:01:49 salazzle is like a hot milk, just exactly the same drawing.
02:01:53 But like through the eyes of just a normal...
02:01:55 Like, I'm not even saying they're abnormal,
02:01:56 but like through a non-furry,
02:01:58 salazzle is simply like a slightly feminine lizard creature.
02:02:01 So it's really the eye of the beholder
02:02:03 that I think decides a lot of it.
02:02:06 I don't know, that's what I got.
02:02:07 Okay, let's move on.
02:02:08 Because this is a hot one, boys.
02:02:09 We got Gnoggin the Genome is calling in.
02:02:12 Oh, from lock stock in Gnoggin?
02:02:15 Indeed. Let's hear what he has to say for us.
02:02:17 Go.
02:02:21 Hello, my old chums.
02:02:23 Gnoggin the Genome here.
02:02:25 A huge fan of the gontas.
02:02:27 I've been listening since episode one.
02:02:30 I have a question for Mr. Bestman.
02:02:33 I understand that you're a huge fan of the Gnoblin Slayer.
02:02:37 And I am too.
02:02:38 A very important Gnome called Gnadoch Gnitler
02:02:42 once said 14 very famous words.
02:02:45 You must secure the existence of our people
02:02:48 and a future for all Gnome children.
02:02:52 Right, now then, if a Gnoblin came into your hovel,
02:02:56 what do you invite him inside for cream cakes
02:02:59 and chocolate going to drink?
02:03:00 Or what do you call Gnoggin the Stapho and Mr. Godwin say?
02:03:04 Gnoggin the Gnoblin Slayer.
02:03:06 This is Gnoggin the Gnome, sign him off.
02:03:09 Cheerio!
02:03:11 Boy, I'd be on that phone to the Gn-
02:03:13 G-G-G-Gnostapo like that.
02:03:15 I'd be fucking absolutely fucking Gnoblins.
02:03:22 Better safe than sorry with Gnoblin than sorry with say.
02:03:25 Well, you know, one of the untold stories of our age
02:03:28 that history will look back at us unfavorably for not reporting on
02:03:31 is the deep racial tension between the Gnoblins and the Gnomes
02:03:34 and they will understand that we just turned a blind eye
02:03:37 to the genocide and the massacre,
02:03:38 but hopefully we can spread awareness here.
02:03:41 If we don't learn from history, we're doomed to repeat it.
02:03:43 Exactly.
02:03:44 Oh, I love you, Gnoggin.
02:03:46 You're my hero.
02:03:47 Okay, let's move on.
02:03:50 Oh, wait.
02:03:51 Okay.
02:03:51 Charming.
02:03:52 I was going to play this one from Chilling Chocolate
02:03:54 that was about the Teen CP,
02:03:56 but Munchy isn't here and also it was a shit message.
02:03:59 There was another like, oh, please pay attention to me.
02:04:01 I'm the Teen CP.
02:04:02 Please play me on your podcast.
02:04:04 Listen, guys, you got to get organized.
02:04:06 Classic Teen, classic Teen CP tactics.
02:04:09 Munchy was here.
02:04:09 It's just a phase.
02:04:10 It's just a phase.
02:04:11 It's just a phase.
02:04:11 If Munchy was here, I'd at least tell them like...
02:04:13 Dude, that should be their slogan.
02:04:14 That should be their slogan.
02:04:15 It's just a phase.
02:04:16 Teen CP.
02:04:17 It's just a phase.
02:04:18 That's a good one.
02:04:19 Yeah, some sons, you're gonna have to try better than that.
02:04:23 You're gonna have to try better than that
02:04:24 to earn your fatherly boomer father pride.
02:04:27 Indeed, indeed.
02:04:28 Episode one is out though.
02:04:29 We'll let you ride the lawn mower.
02:04:31 Episode one and maybe episode two will be out
02:04:32 when you hear this on Munchy's YouTube channel.
02:04:34 So go check it out if you want to.
02:04:35 But I'm just saying, like, okay,
02:04:38 there's a problem with the Teen CP,
02:04:40 which is that there's no discord or anything
02:04:42 for people to be on.
02:04:43 So they come to the PCP one or like RFCK
02:04:47 because they don't know...
02:04:48 Like, Chilling Chocolate wants to be on,
02:04:50 I think is the idea,
02:04:51 but he doesn't know where to go to talk to you guys.
02:04:54 So for the love of God, get organized.
02:04:56 They're directionless and aimless,
02:04:57 but they don't know what to do.
02:04:58 Indeed.
02:05:00 Munchy, here's the solution.
02:05:01 Make a discord server.
02:05:02 It doesn't have to be Munchy.
02:05:03 Anyone in the Teen CP,
02:05:04 make a discord server and post the link
02:05:06 in the fucking comments or something
02:05:08 so we can not have to hear your shitty comments anymore,
02:05:12 complaining and whining and shit.
02:05:13 Okay.
02:05:13 No kids allowed.
02:05:14 No kids allowed.
02:05:15 Okay, final message.
02:05:17 It is Game Board Gaylord Final.
02:05:20 Thank God.
02:05:21 Okay, let's see what he's got for us today.
02:05:23 Go.
02:05:23 It is me, the Game Board Gaylord,
02:05:25 and I am here to inform you that I won.
02:05:28 I did it.
02:05:28 What?
02:05:29 I told you so.
02:05:29 No, come on.
02:05:30 All right.
02:05:30 Now, let's play another game.
02:05:33 Just kidding.
02:05:34 I just want to know what your favorite board game is.
02:05:36 That's all.
02:05:38 All right, thank God.
02:05:39 It was all a long time to get us to say
02:05:43 what our favorite board game is.
02:05:44 I like Monopoly a lot.
02:05:46 Oh, that's disgusting.
02:05:46 As I would.
02:05:48 Nate, everyone hates Monopoly.
02:05:50 I don't think you've played Monopoly recently,
02:05:51 or you wouldn't say.
02:05:52 Probably not in the last five years.
02:05:53 One person in the world that would love Monopoly.
02:05:55 No, I really like Monopoly.
02:05:56 When I was like 13 to never play Monopoly again,
02:05:59 and I've held strong to it.
02:06:00 So she gave me.
02:06:01 I win Monopoly most of the time.
02:06:03 I'm just saying.
02:06:03 I'm just saying.
02:06:04 That's why I like it.
02:06:04 The person that wins Monopoly
02:06:06 is just the person who lands on a good space first.
02:06:09 That's not crazy.
02:06:10 I once played like the legendary,
02:06:15 into the wee hours of the morning,
02:06:17 family Monopoly at a Christmas family gathering,
02:06:21 where it was me and some of my cousins and uncles.
02:06:24 Everyone else had gone to bed,
02:06:25 but I was like the last young boy there.
02:06:28 I was like seven or something.
02:06:30 And I won.
02:06:32 I beat everyone.
02:06:33 Wait, what was the game?
02:06:33 Family at Monopoly.
02:06:34 Oh, I see.
02:06:35 I see.
02:06:35 Because it went on for like seven hours,
02:06:38 and it was the first time in my life
02:06:40 that I had stayed up so late without getting tired.
02:06:43 I felt like a god.
02:06:44 But after that, I realized that I don't want to do that again.
02:06:47 So I never played again.
02:06:47 You're going to go on the high note, you know?
02:06:49 Shoots and ladders is fun.
02:06:51 Oh, my God.
02:06:52 You guys have the worst fucking board game ever.
02:06:55 Here is a great board game.
02:06:57 Fucking Buccaneer.
02:06:58 It is a pirate sailing board game
02:07:01 involving stealing things from treasures
02:07:05 from certain islands on squares on the map.
02:07:08 It's a game my dad played when he was young,
02:07:10 and he bought a version of eBay,
02:07:13 and we played it a few times.
02:07:14 And it's got these tiny plastic pirate ships,
02:07:18 and it's this four harbors,
02:07:21 and you can go and raid someone else's harbor
02:07:23 if you have a higher number of crew.
02:07:25 And the crew is like, you get them from cards,
02:07:27 and you can trade crew for treasures and stuff.
02:07:30 Really strategic, really fun, great.
02:07:33 Great game.
02:07:34 Doesn't last for hours.
02:07:35 That's good.
02:07:35 That's important.
02:07:36 It feels like very balanced.
02:07:39 Now, here comes Big Dick Tom.
02:07:41 He's going to be like, Katan.
02:07:42 I like Katan in the merely indifferent board games
02:07:45 that boomers play these days.
02:07:48 It's probably a toss-up either between
02:07:49 Betrayalight House on the Hill or Mansions of Madness.
02:07:51 They're both really fun.
02:07:52 I played one of those.
02:07:54 It's fun.
02:07:55 I think I played the first one with you at the time.
02:07:56 Yeah, we played when you guys came over that one time,
02:07:59 and it was a great time.
02:08:00 Wait, was Nate there, too?
02:08:01 Nate was there.
02:08:02 Yeah.
02:08:03 Huh.
02:08:04 Oh, the furtive Nate, so easily forgotten.
02:08:06 That was the trip when Nate,
02:08:08 they were playing board games, and he's like,
02:08:10 wait, I got to go talk about the analysis anarchy
02:08:12 and just hijack my computer.
02:08:14 And wait.
02:08:15 Wait, what?
02:08:16 Well, I don't remember this.
02:08:18 Wait, Tom, please explain that.
02:08:19 I don't remember what you're talking about.
02:08:20 Oh, god.
02:08:21 I remember, okay, I remember I went to your house
02:08:24 a couple times.
02:08:25 I forgot that Nate was there one time.
02:08:27 Yeah, Nate was there one time.
02:08:27 Did you?
02:08:28 Uh-huh.
02:08:29 Yeah.
02:08:29 Was this when an analysis anarchy
02:08:30 had just come out or something?
02:08:32 Yeah, this was a while ago.
02:08:33 It was like years ago.
02:08:33 Oh, it was like the first time,
02:08:34 and I think we were just being like, wow, what the fuck.
02:08:38 And you were like, you took my computer.
02:08:40 Like, I need to get on a Skype call
02:08:41 and figure out what is going on.
02:08:42 And we're all just like, gay.
02:08:45 Wait a minute.
02:08:45 Wait a minute.
02:08:46 Was the Skype call, was that when I was deciding
02:08:48 whether I was going to be on the show or not?
02:08:50 I believe so.
02:08:51 I believe that is what it happened.
02:08:51 Yeah, I think that's right.
02:08:53 That's when the fateful decision was made
02:08:54 and the timeline split between me and Ben.
02:08:56 Me on the light path, Ben on the dark path.
02:08:58 I was going, no, that's when we split
02:09:00 into the worst timeline when you decided
02:09:02 not to follow me on my journey into whatever the fuck that was.
02:09:06 An analysis anarchy.
02:09:07 Yeah, that was when it all started to go wrong.
02:09:09 Indeed.
02:09:10 And only for you.
02:09:11 I'm pretty good at boggle.
02:09:14 Boggle.
02:09:15 Okay, not bad.
02:09:16 I think I'm pretty dang good at boggle.
02:09:19 Yep.
02:09:20 You know, I try to-
02:09:21 Oh, wait, wait, fridge scrabble.
02:09:22 Fridge scrabble, fridge magnets,
02:09:24 where you'd write something on the fridge
02:09:26 and it's really funny and then someone writes a response
02:09:29 with the remaining letters
02:09:30 and then you change your thing to a different thing.
02:09:32 That's my favorite board game.
02:09:34 It's played vertically.
02:09:35 And there's, yeah, vertical fridge scrabble.
02:09:40 Vertical integration.
02:09:41 It doesn't matter.
02:09:42 It's just really funny.
02:09:43 Excellent.
02:09:44 All right, I think we're done here, folks.
02:09:46 That's all the board games that exist.
02:09:47 I have, yeah.
02:09:48 Hey, I wanna, before the show ends,
02:09:50 I wanna, I have two things to plug.
02:09:52 One, this week, when you hear this,
02:09:54 once again, another vaporette will be posted
02:09:58 on my website, stcomics.com.
02:10:00 Ben, I don't know who did that.
02:10:01 I loved that last, I was like,
02:10:03 wow, Ben's art really improved for this one.
02:10:05 And then I was like, oh, shit.
02:10:08 Oh, you mean Lauren Colt?
02:10:09 I believe so.
02:10:10 It was the newest one, the fluffy animation.
02:10:12 I mean, it looked great.
02:10:13 Yeah, that one, that one.
02:10:14 Lauren Colt is so...
02:10:15 Why did she agree to work on your lowly project?
02:10:18 Oh, sorry.
02:10:19 He, well, we did it, well, we did an art.
02:10:21 So I did two pages for his webcomic
02:10:23 and he did two pages for mine.
02:10:23 Why did he downgrade so savagely as Michael?
02:10:27 All right, all right, I get it.
02:10:28 Yes, I get it, yes.
02:10:30 Lauren Colt's art is lush
02:10:32 and you should all check him out on Twitter and whatever.
02:10:34 Well, that was the one where,
02:10:35 where What's Your Face Came Home and saw,
02:10:37 oh, maybe I shouldn't spoil it,
02:10:38 but the shower was involved, right?
02:10:39 Yeah, I don't spoil it.
02:10:42 No.
02:10:42 Oh no, it was right, it was just the room.
02:10:44 Okay.
02:10:44 Wait, wait, wait, wait, your spoilers?
02:10:45 I'm sorry, I just want to say the art was fantastic
02:10:47 and I loved it.
02:10:48 It is, it puts me to shame.
02:10:50 Yeah, fair.
02:10:51 It's, I'm disgraced.
02:10:53 But don't worry, no worries about that this week
02:10:55 because this week's one is drawn by Munchie.
02:10:57 Oh, how exciting.
02:10:58 So no, so no, but it's like 11 pages long.
02:11:02 He didn't, he just made it 11 pages long for some reason,
02:11:04 so it's like way longer.
02:11:05 There's like two, right?
02:11:05 So that'll be up on the website.
02:11:07 Yeah, the others are two pages.
02:11:08 Well, I don't know why.
02:11:09 I don't know why.
02:11:09 He just decided to make his fucking long as hell.
02:11:12 Also, me and my friend John recorded a podcast.
02:11:15 It's called Grimp.
02:11:16 Episode one is out now.
02:11:17 What's the subject of description?
02:11:18 What do you talk about?
02:11:19 We talk about art anxiety.
02:11:21 It's a title, a reference to Gimp
02:11:24 and how it's better than Photoshop.
02:11:26 And for free.
02:11:28 Maybe.
02:11:28 The podcast was almost called the official Dijornos podcast.
02:11:33 That would have been good too.
02:11:35 But we chickened out.
02:11:37 Didn't want to get that C, so this is this letter.
02:11:39 You feared the long, yeah, the long-term game
02:11:41 had to play it safe.
02:11:42 My plug.
02:11:43 But there's chill jams.
02:11:44 There's chill jams in it too, so.
02:11:46 My plug is going to be if you're listening to the PCP,
02:11:48 you should also be listening to Artso Farto's
02:11:50 Whirling Dervish podcast.
02:11:52 It's the podcast that I am the most proud of,
02:11:56 of any podcast I've ever been involved with.
02:11:59 Wow.
02:11:59 It's pretty good.
02:12:00 Frankly, I don't know how you sit down.
02:12:02 I don't know how you sit down to nobody else involved but you.
02:12:03 How fit for this?
02:12:04 I was going to say, wait, who do you do it with?
02:12:05 It's a loan.
02:12:06 It's just me.
02:12:06 It's a loan.
02:12:07 Well, it's not even me.
02:12:08 It's Artso Farto.
02:12:09 I'm not even a part of it.
02:12:11 There is Tard Wrangler May in the back though.
02:12:13 You're just the producer.
02:12:14 Oh yeah, that's true.
02:12:15 May is in the background as the Tard Wrangler.
02:12:18 She doesn't really say anything.
02:12:20 She's just there to make sure that.
02:12:23 I've been wondering, what do you think is,
02:12:26 like what are the stakes here that May is here to like prevent happening?
02:12:29 What could happen?
02:12:30 Maybe it's happening and you cut it out, I don't know.
02:12:32 Who knows?
02:12:33 If you go to.
02:12:34 I mean, I do record the, well,
02:12:37 Artso records the podcast standing up in his underwear.
02:12:41 So the whole thing is done as a standing rant,
02:12:44 make it in my room, in the office.
02:12:47 So I guess just to make sure that it doesn't become like some kind of bath salts rampage.
02:12:52 Okay, that's fair.
02:12:55 You made the analogy in, I think the second one about how the whirling dervish is like your
02:13:00 CPU fan trying to keep you cool so you don't.
02:13:03 Yeah, May is like when you just have to pull the power plug out of the wall.
02:13:07 Exactly.
02:13:07 It's too bad.
02:13:09 I've had to do that to computers before.
02:13:11 I haven't really enjoyed them incidentally.
02:13:12 Big fan, big fan.
02:13:13 Thank you.
02:13:14 We'll go on, Gabe.
02:13:14 I want to plug again, the the the punk plush Kickstarter.
02:13:19 It started off real, real strong, but it's slowing down.
02:13:22 Needs it needs another bump.
02:13:23 It needs, it needs you.
02:13:24 I'm personally invested because I pledge and if you people don't fucking make this happen,
02:13:29 I don't get my pump plush, fuck all of you, make it real.
02:13:33 Yeah, you got to, you got to share it and you got to, you got to make people become fans.
02:13:38 But also if you're not like willing to throw down like a big, you know, cash settle.
02:13:46 I will be doing like art commissions if you like my art style, if you just like want to help.
02:13:52 That is like a lower tier reward.
02:13:53 If you want to do that instead, that's a thing.
02:13:58 Hopefully this, this will work.
02:13:59 But if it doesn't, I, I'm, you know, I'm not going to be like crying, but it will be like,
02:14:07 you'll have like a lot of angry people who wanted the plush and they will kill you instead.
02:14:11 They will be the ones killing you.
02:14:13 You will become a target of that.
02:14:15 You know, you know, Gabe, I'm such a cheap asshole.
02:14:18 I was thinking to myself like, I've got it.
02:14:19 I do, I would like the plush if it was just supporting something abstract, I wouldn't do it.
02:14:23 But since there's a plush on the line, I was like, that's interesting.
02:14:26 You know what I'll do?
02:14:27 I'll split it with Michelle.
02:14:28 And then we can both like enjoy having the plush.
02:14:30 The problem was she had already given money.
02:14:33 And so she didn't want to split with me again.
02:14:35 And I'm not willing to go all the way myself.
02:14:38 So what I want, what I want to give.
02:14:40 Unforgivable.
02:14:41 I want you.
02:14:42 So she, so she already got one.
02:14:43 No, well, she didn't pledge that much.
02:14:45 She pledged like a lower tier thing or something, like 10 or 20 bucks or something.
02:14:48 Yeah, no, she, she, I think she didn't ask for a, for a reward at all.
02:14:52 I think, I think that's true.
02:14:53 Well, she just pledged, well, she just pledged like,
02:14:55 if she just pledged like five more bucks or whatever, then you could go half.
02:14:59 All you got to do, all you got to do, you just go and edit her pledge,
02:15:02 and then you pay the rest of it and get up to the.
02:15:04 Oh, okay.
02:15:04 See, I was going to ask if that's something that we could do.
02:15:06 That's what I was going to ask.
02:15:07 Yeah, you can edit your pledge at any time.
02:15:08 You can do that.
02:15:09 If you have, if you have a pledge currently, you can, you can double it.
02:15:12 You can triple it.
02:15:13 I won't send you more plushies unless you ask for it.
02:15:15 Okay.
02:15:16 But like, like, I mean, that's, that's still a thing that can, can be.
02:15:20 You remember that guy?
02:15:22 If you say, if you say like in the comments, so like, I'm pledging double the amount,
02:15:26 can I have two, I will say yes, because as long as the money is, you know, is there,
02:15:31 I will be able to get the product.
02:15:33 Okay, I got you.
02:15:34 I was going to, I was going to say, if that wasn't a possibility,
02:15:36 I was going to ask you to be like, remember that guy in the undead church,
02:15:39 when you ring the bell, who like absolves ones of sin, I was like,
02:15:42 can you please absolve Michelle of the guilt of unpledging, like personally,
02:15:47 so that we can repledge together and then pay for it.
02:15:50 But okay.
02:15:51 Okay.
02:15:51 Good.
02:15:51 We will edit her pledge and I'll be, I'll chip in on half of that or whatever.
02:15:55 Okay.
02:15:55 Sick.
02:15:56 I, I forgot to mention, yeah, this week when you hear this, uh,
02:16:00 vaporette is munchies vaporette.
02:16:02 And then next week, vapor's three drop.
02:16:04 Oh my God.
02:16:05 How exciting.
02:16:06 Yeah.
02:16:06 I can't wait.
02:16:07 I, I know, like, right.
02:16:09 I, it's so forever.
02:16:11 It's been fucking forever.
02:16:12 I'm incredibly stoked.
02:16:13 Uh, will it be worth it?
02:16:15 Yes.
02:16:15 Of course not.
02:16:16 No, nothing will be worth, nothing will be,
02:16:18 nothing will be worth the time it has taken, but perhaps it will be some
02:16:21 consolation to you and me that it finally exists.
02:16:25 If only then, we can all take sucker.
02:16:28 If only I could, I could unmute you on Twitter to get those updates,
02:16:32 except that I would see you just being mean to Boogie and instantly turn it off again
02:16:36 and not want to be anywhere near.
02:16:37 What the fuck?
02:16:38 What the fuck?
02:16:39 Fuck you.
02:16:39 Fuck Boogie.
02:16:41 Boogie is a fucking coward.
02:16:42 I'm just saying, I don't like meanness, but okay.
02:16:44 Anyway, anyway.
02:16:45 Boogie is a fucking, oh my God.
02:16:46 Let's fucking go on and think about Boogie.
02:16:48 Let's talk about Boogie.
02:16:49 No, no, I gotta wait.
02:16:50 Wait, no, no, no.
02:16:51 Fade out, fade out, fade out.
02:16:52 I gotta include my pit.
02:16:53 Centrist, fensitize.
02:16:55 All right, all right, great.
02:16:56 Okay, cool.
02:16:57 But, but let me just get my pledge, which is just that, hey everybody,
02:16:59 MiaMath of a 2, uh, I was late, it's not done yet,
02:17:02 but it's going to be done like a day or two.
02:17:04 So that's exciting.
02:17:04 But right now, uh, well actually it'll be like a week ago for you.
02:17:07 You can go listen to the MiaMath of a 2 theme,
02:17:09 which is available on Spotify and Bandcamp.
02:17:12 And I think people might enjoy listening to it because it's really cool.
02:17:15 And Hylio did a great job.
02:17:16 And, uh, you can give me money for it on Bandcamp if you want to pay to download the track,
02:17:20 but it's also free.
02:17:21 So, you know, do whatever the fuck you want.
02:17:23 And that's real nice.
02:17:24 And I think it's real good.
02:17:25 And I'm super happy it's out.
02:17:26 Thanks again, Munchy for making the logo, which is beautiful.
02:17:29 And thanks to Hylio for making the song.
02:17:30 Couldn't be happier with it.
02:17:31 And definitive edition coming soon.
02:17:34 Get ready for it.
02:17:35 My plug is the Zoom game.
02:17:37 It's on Twitter.
02:17:38 It is the second best voted, voted the second best game of May on Newgrounds official.
02:17:43 I was beaten out by a shitty game that just had a girl with big tits on it.
02:17:46 Titties, right?
02:17:47 Yeah, yeah, of course.
02:17:48 You can't compete.
02:17:49 You can't compete.
02:17:49 You got to give a Zoomie big tits.
02:17:51 That's what everyone said.
02:17:52 I said no flat hashtag flat lives matter.
02:17:55 Representing.
02:17:55 No, no.
02:17:56 This is my fucking thing.
02:17:57 This is my new crusade.
02:17:59 Fucking big titty.
02:18:00 Hey, oblivion fall in the comments.
02:18:01 Oblivion fall in the comments.
02:18:02 What do you say?
02:18:03 He was like, he was like, I can't believe all these quote unquote cowards and quote unquote
02:18:08 straight man.
02:18:09 You are all about the huge titties.
02:18:10 That's right.
02:18:11 That's right.
02:18:11 Yeah, all you gotta do.
02:18:12 Oblivion fall, you're my boy.
02:18:13 I don't even mind that you called me a conch.
02:18:17 All you got to do, Tom, new character, just be the big tit character.
02:18:21 I'm going to have to do that.
02:18:22 You just have to have a nice little flat.
02:18:25 Also a furry.
02:18:25 There's a term for it that I forget.
02:18:26 I mean, I know it's a character when they're like wearing their shirt.
02:18:28 You can't see their tits, but miraculously when they open their shirt,
02:18:32 all of a sudden they have gigantic titties or whatever.
02:18:34 I don't know what the term for it is, but that could be a Zoomie still on the table.
02:18:40 The term for it is canon.
02:18:43 All right.
02:18:44 Let's end on a high note, people.
02:18:45 Think about a Zoomie's big hidden titties.
02:18:47 All right.
