00:00:00 Hiya.
00:00:02 Hiya.
00:00:04 No, no, no. It's just that it's called Hiya.
00:00:08 But it's a type of Hiya.
00:00:11 It's called Hiya, but I don't think so.
00:00:15 It's amazing how great it is.
00:00:18 If you put the weight in and turn it,
00:00:22 even if something bad happens, it's okay to put it in the book.
00:00:25 That's my opinion.
00:00:27 I've been doing a series of online online classes since I was a child.
00:00:31 I've been doing online online classes since I was a child.
00:00:37 The most important thing is not to fall.
00:00:39 I've been doing online classes since I was a child.
00:00:43 That's how you think.
00:00:45 That's how I think.
00:00:48 That's right.
00:00:57 I'm the best guy ever.
00:00:59 Last week was a mistake. I'll never leave you again.
00:01:01 I swear upon my Lord Jesus Christ.
00:01:03 With us today is Mumkey Jones.
00:01:08 Yeah, he's having a tough time right now.
00:01:10 Ben St. is here.
00:01:15 And Hippocrite is also joining us.
00:01:18 Yeah.
00:01:20 Fuck your enthusiasm.
00:01:22 Fuck you. Fuck the PCP.
00:01:24 Fuck my ass and suck my dick.
00:01:26 The PCP is what you got left.
00:01:28 It's all I have left is the PCP.
00:01:30 You fuckers have more subs than me now, God damn it.
00:01:33 It's true. Let's address this right away.
00:01:35 Guys, there's been a terrible event in case you haven't heard.
00:01:38 Mumkey's channel was in fact deleted.
00:01:40 It was destroyed from YouTube.
00:01:42 His main channel due to infringement of what was it?
00:01:45 Terms of service or something?
00:01:47 Wasn't it violent content?
00:01:49 No, it was. I made fun of Muslims one time too many
00:01:52 and they couldn't handle it.
00:01:54 I mean, that certainly seems to be the case.
00:01:56 His Sharia law video, in fact,
00:01:58 you were making jokes about how many subs you will lose.
00:02:00 You did in fact lose all of them as it turns out,
00:02:03 which is a certain kind of hilarity.
00:02:05 But it's quite sad.
00:02:07 So first of all, Mumkey's migrating his work
00:02:10 over to his Mumkey Jones 2 channel,
00:02:12 which is now just called Mumkey Jones, as I understand it, right?
00:02:15 Link in the description, of course.
00:02:17 We need to update all our links on the PCP.
00:02:19 No, I don't care.
00:02:21 Okay, alright.
00:02:23 Fair enough.
00:02:25 But, I mean, I don't know what's appropriate.
00:02:28 I guess, sub to his new channel.
00:02:30 If you like Mumkey shit, even if you don't like it,
00:02:32 support the man, because it's not right what's been done to him.
00:02:34 No.
00:02:35 Subscribe to his new channel, or his, you know, his most,
00:02:37 his current channel, his real channel, Mumkey Jones,
00:02:40 and give it to his Patreon, just to say,
00:02:43 fuck you, YouTube.
00:02:45 We support people who do things you don't like,
00:02:47 just across the board.
00:02:49 Anything you oppose were for.
00:02:51 Send YouTube your emails, and fucking tweet at YouTube,
00:02:56 and just fucking spam YouTube.
00:02:58 Is there a link we can use?
00:03:00 We can tell them to send shit to?
00:03:02 There's like a bunch of ways to contact YouTube,
00:03:04 but I don't know which one's the right one.
00:03:06 Incidentally, this will be a week ago,
00:03:08 by the time this actually goes up.
00:03:10 Yeah, I might actually have my channel back by this time.
00:03:12 It's funny.
00:03:13 The depth episode premieres tomorrow,
00:03:15 and the whole time I brag about how many subs I have,
00:03:17 so it's gonna be really funny.
00:03:19 It's gonna be really funny for people who hate me.
00:03:21 That's true. That will be an interesting arc.
00:03:23 Yeah, I can't wait.
00:03:25 I'm gonna avoid that comment section like the plague.
00:03:27 Well, if your channel's not back by the time this goes up,
00:03:32 and people want to...
00:03:34 I'll probably be dead.
00:03:35 Alright, and people want to complain about it.
00:03:37 Where should we send?
00:03:39 How should we protest to YouTube about it?
00:03:41 I think I can find the link where they can fill out a form,
00:03:44 and I'll probably put it in the description.
00:03:46 Can we put it in the description?
00:03:48 Okay.
00:03:49 And by the way, I'd like just people...
00:03:51 I think it will be most constructive to not just send them,
00:03:54 you know, like Islamic State videos
00:03:57 with like, you know, YouTube logo
00:03:59 shoot over the journalist who's getting his head beheaded.
00:04:01 You know, just like...
00:04:02 Those sorts of things will not be constructive.
00:04:04 Don't take the Trump approach.
00:04:06 Yeah, now that's evil.
00:04:08 Don't go crazy and tell them, send them death threats,
00:04:11 or what you've done is evil.
00:04:13 You want to just be...
00:04:14 You want to help...
00:04:15 This is real shit, people. Let's not fuck around.
00:04:17 This is real shit.
00:04:18 So be polite.
00:04:19 Yeah.
00:04:20 And say, you have made a mistake.
00:04:21 Please correct this, Monkey Jones.
00:04:23 Yeah.
00:04:24 This clearly was not hate speech of any kind.
00:04:25 It was simply criticism.
00:04:26 Right.
00:04:27 You know, in a satirical fashion.
00:04:28 So go take that tack, guys,
00:04:30 if you want to really help.
00:04:32 And I certainly do.
00:04:33 So there you go.
00:04:35 There you go.
00:04:36 Do what you can, people.
00:04:37 I guess...
00:04:38 Okay, so moving on.
00:04:39 Our topic for today is being prolific.
00:04:42 Whoa.
00:04:43 Being prolific.
00:04:44 Yeah.
00:04:45 So I...
00:04:46 Me and Nate have been doing...
00:04:48 And Monkey, really.
00:04:49 Monkey's always been quite prolific.
00:04:51 I did it once.
00:04:52 I did it once a long time.
00:04:53 Once in a...
00:04:54 T-Bap was prolific.
00:04:55 Every blue moon.
00:04:56 T-Bap was prolific.
00:04:57 Oh, yeah.
00:04:58 I forgot about T-Bap.
00:04:59 Yeah, T-Bap was pretty prolific back in the day.
00:05:00 Before doing me and Mavva,
00:05:02 I always used to reminisce about how productive I was
00:05:05 during the T-Bap days,
00:05:06 and how much I loved it.
00:05:07 But now I've upgraded my most recent productivity memory.
00:05:12 These days, I reminisce about how productive I was
00:05:16 when I was drawing Brunswick.
00:05:18 That was my, like, golden age.
00:05:21 And I haven't been able to recapture it in a while.
00:05:25 You know, I'm sure this will come up a lot.
00:05:27 And certainly not to criticize,
00:05:29 because I love the work that you do.
00:05:31 Get the fucking...
00:05:32 Don't fucking criticize me.
00:05:35 You would say the same thing yourself.
00:05:37 And you did when talking about Brunswick.
00:05:39 Because when you started Brunswick,
00:05:41 it was a tougher art style.
00:05:42 But like you said,
00:05:43 you were able to get it out really fucking fast.
00:05:45 And then as you got further,
00:05:46 you kind of, like, you know,
00:05:48 you sort of developed more of, like, a connection with it.
00:05:50 Or you want it to be really great,
00:05:51 because you put so much time and work into it.
00:05:53 And, like, you start taking longer on pages,
00:05:55 and they get better.
00:05:57 Yeah, yeah.
00:05:58 Like, I started out with it,
00:06:00 like, I'm just gonna fucking blast it out
00:06:02 and not care that much about how it looks.
00:06:04 But, like, the further I got into it,
00:06:06 and the more important it felt,
00:06:07 like, the less I was able to do that.
00:06:09 So, like, yeah, like, early on,
00:06:11 I was like, I'm gonna draw, like, one,
00:06:13 maybe two pages a day.
00:06:14 And I did.
00:06:15 But then towards the end,
00:06:16 it was more like,
00:06:17 maybe I'll get a page done every other day.
00:06:19 And I mean, from the beginning,
00:06:21 like, the pages were smaller,
00:06:22 so there was, like, less to do on them.
00:06:24 So, like, it was, I don't know,
00:06:26 like, everything about that,
00:06:27 like, the way I approached Brunswick
00:06:29 just, like, led to, like, it getting done really fast.
00:06:31 And it was really good.
00:06:33 And I think I need to fucking,
00:06:35 I think I need to fucking, like,
00:06:37 maybe once champion's done,
00:06:38 I need to fucking take a minute
00:06:40 and, like, look at my life
00:06:41 and look at myself and, like,
00:06:42 maybe go back and...
00:06:43 Take a look at yourself,
00:06:44 then make a change.
00:06:45 Yeah.
00:06:46 And just, like, try and, like,
00:06:47 try and, like, see what I can take from that
00:06:49 and, like, put that in my fucking workflow, you know?
00:06:52 Like, try and replicate those circumstances.
00:06:54 I just had, like, an idea
00:06:56 while you were talking then,
00:06:57 just then, because, like,
00:06:58 I feel like you just need a project
00:07:00 that you feel, like,
00:07:01 you want to make more than you want to hone.
00:07:03 Like, you, like, like...
00:07:05 I disagree.
00:07:06 No, no, no.
00:07:07 What I mean is, like,
00:07:08 spending too much time on each, like, drawing
00:07:11 makes it take so long
00:07:12 and then you feel bad.
00:07:13 But if you had, like, a project
00:07:16 that was sort of, like,
00:07:17 you didn't care too much,
00:07:18 but it was sort of fun to do,
00:07:20 that, you know, that could be, like,
00:07:21 a good way to just get some...
00:07:22 Get yourself on that, like,
00:07:24 choo-choo train of just making things.
00:07:26 And I had an idea.
00:07:27 Oh, you mean, like...
00:07:28 You mean, like, take a break
00:07:30 from, like, the other stuff
00:07:31 and, like, do something
00:07:32 that's less, like, quote-unquote important?
00:07:35 Well, well, I was going to say, like,
00:07:37 doing a HD re-release of Sonichu,
00:07:39 like, just drawing the whole thing yourself.
00:07:42 God.
00:07:43 People have done that, actually,
00:07:44 but I see what you're saying.
00:07:46 That would take so fucking long, dude.
00:07:48 Well, I would actually say,
00:07:49 I think a strategy...
00:07:51 I mean, here I go,
00:07:52 shelling my own shit,
00:07:53 but, like, doing a, like,
00:07:54 maybe I'll actually draw a page a day.
00:07:56 Like, a challenge like that
00:07:57 that forces you into the play position.
00:07:59 I thought about it.
00:08:00 I thought about it.
00:08:01 I can't do it with Champion.
00:08:03 If I start...
00:08:04 Not Champion, sure.
00:08:05 Not Champion, but something else.
00:08:06 If I started a new thing,
00:08:07 I could maybe stick to a page a day
00:08:08 for, like, a month.
00:08:09 Like...
00:08:10 I'd think about it.
00:08:11 Like, I could have done that
00:08:12 with Brunswick.
00:08:13 I could maybe have done that
00:08:14 with Brunswick.
00:08:15 So, yeah, it's a possibility.
00:08:16 I might really like it
00:08:17 if you did a comic version
00:08:18 of some of your recent
00:08:19 Nuzlocke adventures,
00:08:20 if there were any, like,
00:08:21 characters that stick out
00:08:22 in your mind.
00:08:23 Oh, what about,
00:08:24 what about Banana's Final Day?
00:08:25 Or, you know, like, that one?
00:08:26 Something like that.
00:08:27 You know?
00:08:28 Um...
00:08:29 Wait, you, sorry.
00:08:30 You said, like,
00:08:31 like, comic adaptations
00:08:32 of, like, pieces of the Nuzlocke's?
00:08:34 Yeah, sure.
00:08:35 Um...
00:08:36 Yeah.
00:08:37 That's a really good idea.
00:08:38 That's a really good idea.
00:08:40 I really...
00:08:41 Please do Banana's Final Day.
00:08:43 Please, if you had to do it.
00:08:44 That's my favorite thing
00:08:45 that's ever happened.
00:08:46 Banana's Final Day,
00:08:47 or Banana's Big Day Out
00:08:48 or whatever I call it,
00:08:49 is my favorite moment
00:08:50 from both series.
00:08:51 This is amazing.
00:08:52 I'm here, everybody.
00:08:53 Oh!
00:08:54 I'm late.
00:08:55 But I...
00:08:56 Did we just start?
00:08:57 We've...
00:08:58 No, we've been going for
00:08:59 10 minutes or so,
00:09:00 but only because we already
00:09:01 have been waiting
00:09:02 for people such as you
00:09:03 to show up in the first place.
00:09:04 If you're...
00:09:05 Okay, if I'm too late,
00:09:06 I'll just go
00:09:07 if you don't want me here.
00:09:08 No.
00:09:09 But I'm here now.
00:09:10 No, it's fine.
00:09:11 Right?
00:09:12 I think, guys,
00:09:13 let's do a quick vote.
00:09:14 Who votes Jesse can stay.
00:09:15 Yay!
00:09:16 Stay!
00:09:17 I vote yay.
00:09:18 I vote yay.
00:09:19 Yay.
00:09:20 All right.
00:09:21 Sorry.
00:09:22 I just got home.
00:09:23 I was at the happiest place
00:09:24 in the world,
00:09:25 the Gibraltar Trade Center.
00:09:26 It's a big, grimy,
00:09:27 dirty flea market
00:09:28 full of cool stuff.
00:09:29 We...
00:09:30 I don't think they're joined.
00:09:31 They can't.
00:09:32 But I want you here.
00:09:33 I want Jesse here.
00:09:34 I'm a weak.
00:09:35 I'm a weak man.
00:09:36 I can't hold on my own rules.
00:09:37 Monkey,
00:09:38 do you have any strong feelings
00:09:39 about this?
00:09:40 Oh, that's...
00:09:41 That's because the...
00:09:42 Let's give him 10% less pay
00:09:43 so I can get my money's worth.
00:09:45 The rules...
00:09:46 Okay, you're getting dark.
00:09:47 The rules document...
00:09:48 The rules document says
00:09:49 you can join late
00:09:50 and it's fine.
00:09:51 Like, that's...
00:09:52 Like, that's what the
00:09:53 explicitly written rules say.
00:09:55 Okay, I think that, like,
00:09:56 30 minutes late
00:09:58 should be the cutoff
00:09:59 for two weeks.
00:10:00 This is 25 minutes.
00:10:01 25 minutes.
00:10:02 That's very damn fucking close.
00:10:03 Yeah.
00:10:04 You're under the wire.
00:10:05 You're under the wire
00:10:06 that you put there yourself
00:10:08 slightly above yourself.
00:10:09 Just now.
00:10:10 Okay, we'll work on this later.
00:10:12 I don't care if you're here.
00:10:13 We'll figure it out.
00:10:15 By the way,
00:10:16 before we get too crazy,
00:10:17 let me actually read,
00:10:18 just for fun,
00:10:19 the Urban Dictionary Definition
00:10:20 of Prolific.
00:10:21 Just because...
00:10:22 Yeah, I think you'll find it
00:10:23 interesting.
00:10:24 Okay.
00:10:25 So here's the top definition,
00:10:26 Prolific.
00:10:28 Utterly, unexceptional,
00:10:29 absolutely average.
00:10:31 Person one,
00:10:32 did you go to that alternative
00:10:33 rap show on the weekend?
00:10:34 Person two,
00:10:35 yeah, it was prolific, eh?
00:10:37 This is the worst...
00:10:38 That doesn't sound right at all.
00:10:40 That's just wrong, yeah.
00:10:42 Listen to the next one.
00:10:43 This is the second one.
00:10:44 Prolific.
00:10:45 A dumb man's profound
00:10:47 actually means
00:10:48 fertile or producing.
00:10:49 I mean, I guess that
00:10:50 second part's true.
00:10:51 Okay, so they're saying
00:10:52 that people confuse the words.
00:10:54 And people...
00:10:55 I guess so.
00:10:56 And, like, the first one
00:10:57 is just that confusion
00:10:58 or something.
00:10:59 I've never been confused
00:11:00 on this word.
00:11:01 Does anyone actually think
00:11:02 this means mediocre or something?
00:11:03 Okay, whatever.
00:11:04 Well, I gotta say that
00:11:05 I'm actually pro-choicic.
00:11:07 Wow.
00:11:08 Nice.
00:11:09 Thanks, Ibo.
00:11:10 Just like my girl Hillary,
00:11:12 my hero.
00:11:13 It could be a statement that
00:11:14 people who play out a lot of stuff
00:11:16 evidently have a lower quality
00:11:18 since they, like,
00:11:19 do too much work.
00:11:21 I think that's what they're
00:11:22 trying to get at.
00:11:23 I think that's what they're
00:11:24 trying to get at with this.
00:11:25 Like, if you're prolific,
00:11:26 then you obviously aren't working
00:11:27 that hard.
00:11:28 Wait, what was the second one?
00:11:29 A dumb man's profuse?
00:11:31 A dumb man's profound.
00:11:32 Profound.
00:11:33 A dumb man's profound.
00:11:34 Actually means fertile
00:11:35 or producing.
00:11:36 Does that mean the person
00:11:37 using prolific in that way
00:11:38 is a dumb man or...?
00:11:40 Well, yeah.
00:11:41 If you use a word wrong,
00:11:42 you're dumb.
00:11:43 I would agree that
00:11:44 we're all dumb.
00:11:45 Yeah.
00:11:46 But not dumb enough
00:11:47 that we would ever
00:11:48 incorrectly, you know,
00:11:49 misspeak
00:11:50 or anything.
00:11:51 No, never.
00:11:52 Or use one word
00:11:53 when we meant another.
00:11:54 That should be our slogan,
00:11:55 not dumb enough.
00:11:58 All right.
00:11:59 Well, let's,
00:12:00 I don't know,
00:12:01 where should we take this?
00:12:02 Do we want to just talk about
00:12:03 the trials and tribulations
00:12:04 of being prolific
00:12:06 on millions or web?
00:12:08 Now, monkey is,
00:12:09 I think, consistently
00:12:10 the most prolific man here
00:12:12 when he's not doing
00:12:13 a big, big, gay event.
00:12:15 When his channel's not
00:12:16 fucking deleted.
00:12:17 Well, that too.
00:12:18 That too.
00:12:19 So, monkey,
00:12:20 why don't you tell us
00:12:21 about your approach
00:12:22 to your content?
00:12:23 Where prolificity
00:12:25 pertains to it?
00:12:26 I guess that's the word.
00:12:27 So, I have a
00:12:28 dry erase board
00:12:29 up on my wall
00:12:30 above my desk
00:12:31 and it has my
00:12:32 daily schedule.
00:12:33 And, well,
00:12:34 I don't really follow it.
00:12:35 I love it already.
00:12:36 I love it.
00:12:37 I got cucked.
00:12:38 But it's pretty much
00:12:39 like this.
00:12:40 Sunday through Wednesday,
00:12:41 I would do
00:12:42 work on main channel videos.
00:12:43 I treat it like
00:12:44 an actual job
00:12:45 eight hours a day
00:12:46 every day.
00:12:47 So, that's how
00:12:48 I crank out all this shit.
00:12:49 Then the PM
00:12:50 record the
00:12:51 I S M A podcast
00:12:52 AM
00:12:53 of Thursday.
00:12:54 Edit the podcast.
00:12:55 You have to
00:12:56 schedule this shed out
00:12:57 and treat it like a real job.
00:12:58 I love you, monkey.
00:12:59 This is perfect.
00:13:00 This is perfect.
00:13:01 Go.
00:13:02 I've got a massive
00:13:03 erection right now.
00:13:04 Please continue.
00:13:05 Fridays are dedicated
00:13:06 to recording Let's Plays.
00:13:07 And then Saturday
00:13:08 in the AM,
00:13:09 you edit those mother fuckers.
00:13:10 And then Saturday
00:13:11 in the PM,
00:13:12 you record the PCP.
00:13:13 And there you go.
00:13:14 That's my week.
00:13:15 That's what my week
00:13:16 used to be before I decided
00:13:17 I'm going to kill myself.
00:13:18 And is that to have
00:13:19 Sundays off?
00:13:20 No.
00:13:21 Sundays I work on
00:13:22 main channel videos.
00:13:23 I don't get a day off.
00:13:24 Because my job
00:13:25 is making fucking
00:13:26 YouTube videos.
00:13:27 Exactly.
00:13:28 Days off are for
00:13:29 week faggots.
00:13:30 Every day is a day off.
00:13:31 I love it.
00:13:32 Days off are
00:13:33 literally a fake
00:13:34 meme.
00:13:35 A fake news
00:13:36 created by unions
00:13:37 to trick us into
00:13:38 thinking that we're
00:13:39 less cool than we
00:13:40 actually are
00:13:41 as human beings.
00:13:42 Weekends are for
00:13:43 if you've got a shit job
00:13:44 that I'm sure you're
00:13:45 totally into a weekend.
00:13:46 Weekends are for
00:13:47 people with bad jobs.
00:13:48 That's what they are.
00:13:49 It says that like
00:13:50 entertainment or the arts
00:13:51 is not a real job.
00:13:52 Fuck that.
00:13:53 If that person
00:13:54 has a quote
00:13:55 real job where they
00:13:56 get a fucking weekend
00:13:57 and days off
00:13:58 and get to go home at
00:13:59 5 p.m.
00:14:00 Fuck them.
00:14:01 They're the lazy ones.
00:14:02 They're scum.
00:14:03 They're nothing to me.
00:14:04 I work
00:14:05 fucking 25 hours a day
00:14:06 366 days a year.
00:14:08 Never had an off day
00:14:09 since before I was born.
00:14:11 Fuck you.
00:14:12 Die.
00:14:13 And the way that
00:14:14 I've been getting those
00:14:15 is actually every
00:14:16 PCP is recorded.
00:14:17 We actually talk
00:14:18 10 times speed and then
00:14:19 we slow down.
00:14:20 Except for today
00:14:21 when I can 10 minutes late
00:14:22 for the podcast
00:14:23 because I was at a flea market.
00:14:24 The happiest place.
00:14:25 The only day off
00:14:26 I've ever had in my life
00:14:27 and I still made it
00:14:28 to work on time.
00:14:29 Yeah.
00:14:30 On time.
00:14:31 What was the place called again?
00:14:32 Roughly on time.
00:14:33 Whatever.
00:14:34 Yeah.
00:14:35 That's great.
00:14:36 Jesse, what was that
00:14:37 place called again?
00:14:38 I just it sounded magical.
00:14:39 Gibraltar World Fair
00:14:40 or something.
00:14:41 The Gibraltar Trade Center.
00:14:42 Amazing.
00:14:43 I went today.
00:14:44 It's like my favorite
00:14:45 place in the world.
00:14:46 It's like an hour away.
00:14:47 Fantastic.
00:14:48 Like an airplane hanger.
00:14:49 Fucking grimy ghetto
00:14:51 flea market full of like,
00:14:52 you know, just like
00:14:53 vendors full of stuff.
00:14:54 Yeah.
00:14:55 And there's this huge
00:14:56 sign.
00:14:57 I'll post a picture
00:14:58 of me by the sign.
00:14:59 It's the sign of this
00:15:00 of this dandy gentleman
00:15:02 in like a bowler derby
00:15:03 and a brown pinstripe suit
00:15:04 with a cane.
00:15:05 And he's like,
00:15:06 welcome to the Gibraltar
00:15:07 Trade Center.
00:15:08 I'm Gibraltar
00:15:09 and welcome to my stuff.
00:15:10 You can buy my stuff.
00:15:11 He's my best friend.
00:15:12 He's my hero.
00:15:13 He's my father.
00:15:14 I took a picture
00:15:15 standing next to him.
00:15:16 And I went is because
00:15:18 after this summer,
00:15:19 after 37 years,
00:15:21 the Gibraltar Trade Center
00:15:22 is closing its doors
00:15:23 once and for all.
00:15:24 And it's the saddest thing ever.
00:15:25 So yeah.
00:15:26 So I called up my secretary.
00:15:27 I said,
00:15:28 we have to go to Gibraltar
00:15:30 every day this summer
00:15:31 before it closes.
00:15:32 Ben,
00:15:33 remember that trade center
00:15:34 that we went to
00:15:35 where I think we a,
00:15:36 we sold our original
00:15:37 NES with all our games.
00:15:38 Like,
00:15:39 no, no, no.
00:15:40 That's not that's
00:15:41 you're misremembering
00:15:42 because we sold our original
00:15:43 NES at a GameStop.
00:15:44 And I know
00:15:45 because they ripped us off
00:15:46 for an original copy
00:15:47 of Kid Icarus,
00:15:48 which they gave us
00:15:49 a measly,
00:15:50 miserly,
00:15:51 $1.
00:15:52 Parsemonious,
00:15:53 $8 for.
00:15:54 Fucking cucks.
00:15:55 And the one cent
00:15:56 for like all our games.
00:15:57 Probably could have got
00:15:58 like 30 or 50 for it.
00:15:59 Why the fuck
00:16:00 did we sell that?
00:16:01 Okay, but forget that.
00:16:02 But I do remember,
00:16:03 I do remember a flea market.
00:16:04 I do remember
00:16:05 the Gibraltar
00:16:06 trade center.
00:16:07 It sounds so funny to me.
00:16:08 And it's because
00:16:09 the World Trade Center,
00:16:10 that's the first thing.
00:16:11 I was thinking it.
00:16:12 I was thinking it.
00:16:13 I never realized
00:16:14 they got the World Trade Center
00:16:15 and not the Gibraltar one.
00:16:16 Yeah, true.
00:16:17 Nate, but I do remember
00:16:18 a flea market.
00:16:19 The Gibroni trade center.
00:16:20 There was a flea market
00:16:21 where we bought
00:16:22 Earthworm Gym 2.
00:16:23 Metal Gear Solid 1
00:16:24 and Metal Gear Solid 1.
00:16:25 Remember that?
00:16:26 No, but I remember
00:16:27 Earthworm Gym 2.
00:16:28 I remember we bought
00:16:29 Metal Gear Solid 1
00:16:30 at a trade center
00:16:31 because you're like,
00:16:32 my friend,
00:16:33 Stefan really likes this game.
00:16:34 We should buy this game.
00:16:35 That sounds like
00:16:36 something I'd say.
00:16:37 If I can add to
00:16:38 what Jess was saying
00:16:39 about an hour ago
00:16:40 before Nate and Ben
00:16:41 interrupted with
00:16:42 this stupid bullshit.
00:16:43 The point about
00:16:44 the wage cucks,
00:16:45 like, you know,
00:16:46 they go to work at 9,
00:16:47 they go home at 5.
00:16:48 Yeah,
00:16:49 like you get to
00:16:50 stop working at that point.
00:16:51 But when you're doing creative
00:16:52 stuff,
00:16:53 all day you're tormented
00:16:54 by thoughts of,
00:16:55 okay, what should I be working on
00:16:56 next?
00:16:57 What's the next idea?
00:16:58 What's the next video
00:16:59 going to be?
00:17:00 And I can't turn that part off.
00:17:01 It's not like a 9 to 5 job
00:17:02 where it's like,
00:17:03 okay, I'm at this place
00:17:04 and now I'm back at this place.
00:17:05 I'm at home all day
00:17:06 and I can't stop
00:17:07 thinking about things
00:17:08 I should be working on.
00:17:09 It doesn't turn off.
00:17:10 Yeah, it's true.
00:17:11 I can think like,
00:17:12 I can't do anything.
00:17:13 I just like,
00:17:14 I'll lay on the couch
00:17:15 and like try to relax
00:17:16 and play video games.
00:17:17 But like,
00:17:18 even when I'm relaxing,
00:17:19 I'm not relaxing
00:17:20 in my head.
00:17:21 I'm still working
00:17:22 in my brain.
00:17:23 You know what that is?
00:17:24 That's the comfort
00:17:25 of low personal expectations.
00:17:26 Like,
00:17:27 oh yeah,
00:17:28 it's not like
00:17:29 if I work harder,
00:17:30 I'm going to like
00:17:31 make any money today.
00:17:32 Like,
00:17:33 why would I,
00:17:34 why would I go in
00:17:35 and like put in an extra hour
00:17:36 to like get this project done?
00:17:37 I'll just do it on
00:17:38 fucking Monday.
00:17:39 Who gives shit?
00:17:40 And it does,
00:17:41 it does its own destiny
00:17:42 out here doing our own shit,
00:17:43 which is why it's so much better.
00:17:44 And especially like,
00:17:45 our particular branch
00:17:47 of entertainment.
00:17:48 Like,
00:17:49 I'm sure monkey probably
00:17:50 has this problem as well.
00:17:51 Where like,
00:17:52 I feel like I can't play
00:17:53 a video game
00:17:54 because I should be
00:17:55 recording it somehow.
00:17:56 Yes.
00:17:57 Yeah, yes.
00:17:58 Video games now.
00:17:59 Yeah, like video games
00:18:00 are like my,
00:18:01 they've always been
00:18:02 like my most beloved hobby,
00:18:03 but now they're also
00:18:04 just my work.
00:18:05 This is why everybody
00:18:06 should stream all the time
00:18:07 because streaming is,
00:18:08 is basically,
00:18:09 you know,
00:18:10 when you're being able
00:18:11 to play a video game
00:18:12 and relaxing
00:18:13 and chilling out with people
00:18:14 and you're not,
00:18:15 you don't feel like
00:18:16 you're performing,
00:18:17 you feel like you're
00:18:18 hanging out.
00:18:19 And also,
00:18:20 you don't have to edit anything.
00:18:21 It's,
00:18:22 it's so much better
00:18:23 than making Let's Plays.
00:18:24 I made Let's Plays for,
00:18:25 you know,
00:18:26 a couple years.
00:18:27 Nobody ever watched them.
00:18:28 Nobody ever watches
00:18:29 the live streams,
00:18:30 but at least now,
00:18:31 I can see there are a few
00:18:32 Hey man, 23 viewers
00:18:33 reliably turn into
00:18:34 Minecrafty every Friday
00:18:35 and over.
00:18:36 Yeah,
00:18:37 and she bovers like the,
00:18:38 the queen of the chant.
00:18:39 Yeah.
00:18:40 So,
00:18:41 but it's like,
00:18:42 even if it's only 20 people
00:18:43 on a,
00:18:44 on a YouTube view count,
00:18:45 20 people is like,
00:18:46 there's nothing,
00:18:47 but in a stream,
00:18:48 it's like, yeah,
00:18:49 I have 20 whole people here
00:18:50 and they say,
00:18:51 that's a party.
00:18:52 It's not,
00:18:53 it's not just video games.
00:18:54 Like I feel that way
00:18:55 about everything.
00:18:56 Like,
00:18:57 like watching a movie
00:18:58 or something.
00:18:59 It's like,
00:19:00 yeah,
00:19:01 I could,
00:19:02 I'm spending this time
00:19:03 watching a movie like,
00:19:04 man,
00:19:05 I could be making something.
00:19:06 I could have made this movie.
00:19:07 I could have made this movie,
00:19:08 but I was used to look down
00:19:09 and I still do
00:19:10 on people who kind of like,
00:19:11 in a,
00:19:12 just,
00:19:13 just like people who aren't
00:19:14 creators,
00:19:15 but like have a,
00:19:16 a social media presence.
00:19:17 Like they just have a
00:19:18 Facebook page or whatever.
00:19:19 And then they like feel the
00:19:20 need to like document
00:19:21 the cool shit they do.
00:19:22 But like,
00:19:23 I do a different version
00:19:24 of that now where I like
00:19:25 post to Twitter,
00:19:26 the things that I'm doing
00:19:27 that seem interesting
00:19:28 or relevant.
00:19:29 In addition to just my
00:19:30 thoughts and shit,
00:19:31 just cause like,
00:19:32 like when I was in
00:19:33 Anime Expo,
00:19:34 I just felt a desire
00:19:35 to post all this shit
00:19:36 cause it's like relevant
00:19:37 to you.
00:19:38 And,
00:19:39 you know,
00:19:40 it's a little different
00:19:41 from like the reason people
00:19:42 do it,
00:19:43 but I feel like it's part of
00:19:44 like my branding.
00:19:45 So I,
00:19:46 I can feel like I'm
00:19:47 accomplishing something
00:19:48 by doing that,
00:19:49 you know,
00:19:50 like I'm,
00:19:51 I'm helping my,
00:19:52 my business
00:19:53 by doing that shit.
00:19:54 It's cool.
00:19:55 It's cool.
00:19:56 My Twitter doesn't help
00:19:57 my business,
00:19:58 but I do enjoy it.
00:19:59 I don't know.
00:20:00 For a while there,
00:20:01 for a while there,
00:20:02 I was really on
00:20:03 Twitter a lot.
00:20:04 And I kind of,
00:20:05 I don't know.
00:20:06 I was doing something productive
00:20:07 cause I was like,
00:20:08 expanding my social media
00:20:10 outreach or something.
00:20:12 But I think it's,
00:20:14 it's not real.
00:20:15 It's like,
00:20:16 I don't know.
00:20:17 Like it's,
00:20:18 there's such a thing as too much.
00:20:20 You know,
00:20:21 there's not a real
00:20:22 return on investment on Twitter.
00:20:23 There is a bit.
00:20:24 Like I think it's good,
00:20:25 it's good and beneficial
00:20:26 to maintain some kind of like,
00:20:28 you know,
00:20:29 fan like direct line
00:20:30 of communication there
00:20:31 and like talk to people
00:20:32 and like get messages
00:20:33 and respond and,
00:20:34 you know,
00:20:35 show everyone
00:20:36 you're still here
00:20:37 and you're still doing stuff.
00:20:38 But like,
00:20:39 yeah,
00:20:40 not much.
00:20:41 Like a little,
00:20:42 a little bit goes a long way.
00:20:45 Yeah,
00:20:46 I feel like in the last year or so,
00:20:48 I've become like really good at Twitter
00:20:50 to the point where like,
00:20:52 like I've got more followers on Twitter
00:20:54 than people with more
00:20:55 YouTube subscribers than me.
00:20:56 And like,
00:20:57 it feels good.
00:20:58 You get that rush.
00:20:59 You get all the,
00:21:00 the favorites
00:21:01 and the retweets and stuff.
00:21:02 But like,
00:21:03 I would almost prefer to not be
00:21:04 on Twitter,
00:21:05 so I wouldn't tweet as much
00:21:06 because like,
00:21:08 like I have a vision for myself.
00:21:10 Like I long to be
00:21:11 one of those mysterious creators
00:21:13 who doesn't have
00:21:14 a social media presence
00:21:15 and like,
00:21:16 oh, people only know him
00:21:17 from his work
00:21:18 and that's it.
00:21:19 Like I show up out of nowhere
00:21:20 after like months or years
00:21:21 with a video
00:21:22 and people are like,
00:21:23 wow, he's back.
00:21:24 What a legend.
00:21:25 He's back.
00:21:26 I want to be that guy
00:21:27 and I can't because
00:21:28 I'm too damn good at Twitter.
00:21:29 I feel that.
00:21:30 I feel that.
00:21:31 Some,
00:21:32 sometimes it feels,
00:21:33 it feels a little cheap
00:21:34 for me to be like,
00:21:35 going on Twitter
00:21:36 and like just talking to people.
00:21:37 And it's like,
00:21:38 I should be speaking
00:21:39 through my work instead.
00:21:40 Like why do,
00:21:41 why, like why do I have to do,
00:21:42 why am I doing this?
00:21:43 But then it's like,
00:21:44 and like sometimes
00:21:45 like I'll fool myself.
00:21:46 Like I'll lie to myself.
00:21:47 Like I'll,
00:21:48 I'll go on this massive
00:21:49 tweet storm
00:21:50 or I'll make a big chain
00:21:51 of tweets,
00:21:52 making some like,
00:21:53 grand point
00:21:54 or like,
00:21:55 fucking philosophical
00:21:56 theory.
00:21:57 And,
00:21:58 and I'll look at it and like,
00:21:59 hmm,
00:22:00 maybe I'll just take these tweets
00:22:01 and format them
00:22:02 in the form of a video.
00:22:03 So I'll have content.
00:22:04 I'm never gonna fucking do that.
00:22:05 I don't know
00:22:06 why I lie to myself.
00:22:07 Once it's on Twitter,
00:22:08 it's gone.
00:22:09 It doesn't matter.
00:22:10 It's lost to the void.
00:22:11 It's kind of given you,
00:22:12 like, yeah,
00:22:13 since it's sort of published
00:22:14 in a way,
00:22:15 it's like,
00:22:16 yeah,
00:22:17 you get the endorphin rush
00:22:18 of having said it,
00:22:19 but without having said it well
00:22:20 in the format people
00:22:21 actually care about.
00:22:22 And the way that
00:22:23 will actually make you money.
00:22:24 I have seen you
00:22:25 take tweets
00:22:26 and turn them into videos
00:22:27 before,
00:22:28 or at least put them
00:22:29 into videos.
00:22:30 So,
00:22:31 what are your tips
00:22:32 to bring back
00:22:33 in a video form
00:22:34 if I can?
00:22:35 Well,
00:22:36 let's,
00:22:37 I don't know.
00:22:38 I think,
00:22:39 did we get off
00:22:40 our original topic here
00:22:41 a little bit?
00:22:42 I mean,
00:22:43 this is all relevant,
00:22:44 this is all relevant,
00:22:45 but let's focus
00:22:46 in a little bit.
00:22:47 I was asking
00:22:48 Monkey about how he
00:22:49 deals with his
00:22:50 productivity.
00:22:51 And he,
00:22:52 that's perfect,
00:22:53 Monkey.
00:22:54 Your scheduling system
00:22:55 is exactly what
00:22:56 I should be doing.
00:22:57 I,
00:22:58 like,
00:22:59 I don't have time.
00:23:00 So either,
00:23:01 like,
00:23:02 I've decided like,
00:23:03 I'll do a thing
00:23:04 where I'll be like,
00:23:05 I've devoted like,
00:23:06 like Saturdays and Sundays
00:23:07 are like this.
00:23:08 I just sort of think
00:23:09 in my head during the week,
00:23:10 like, okay,
00:23:11 Saturday and Sunday
00:23:12 are just pure
00:23:13 get YouTube stuff done.
00:23:14 Just work on that stuff.
00:23:15 But the problem comes in
00:23:16 that I don't organize
00:23:17 that time,
00:23:18 like specifically enough.
00:23:19 So I'll do things
00:23:20 like wake up in the morning,
00:23:21 like today,
00:23:22 and like,
00:23:23 you know,
00:23:24 okay,
00:23:25 I'll just spend like
00:23:26 an hour,
00:23:27 you know,
00:23:28 and so what,
00:23:29 what am I going to do?
00:23:30 Waste the whole day?
00:23:31 I don't think so.
00:23:32 Meanwhile,
00:23:33 so many Saturdays,
00:23:34 the days that I have,
00:23:35 like,
00:23:36 the most amount of time
00:23:37 to work on shit,
00:23:38 end up just getting consumed
00:23:39 by me thinking like,
00:23:40 oh, I'll do it in a bit.
00:23:41 Oh, I'll do it in a bit.
00:23:42 Oh, I'll do it in a little bit
00:23:43 because I have not structured
00:23:44 my time perfectly enough.
00:23:45 It's almost like
00:23:46 you're a pro Krastin.
00:23:47 Hey,
00:23:48 that's me, baby.
00:23:49 It's funny,
00:23:50 Nate,
00:23:51 that you still go through
00:23:52 that because I'm,
00:23:53 because you did me a math
00:23:54 for,
00:23:55 you had to do it every day.
00:23:56 And I'm doing
00:23:57 the,
00:23:58 my thing,
00:23:59 the Igmovo tourdage thing.
00:24:00 And every time I wake up,
00:24:01 I'm not even considering
00:24:03 not doing anything.
00:24:05 You know,
00:24:06 I've been working like
00:24:07 from 8 a.m. to
00:24:08 however long it takes.
00:24:09 Usually,
00:24:10 usually I finish
00:24:11 the video for the day
00:24:12 by 6
00:24:13 and then I try to
00:24:14 start the next one
00:24:15 immediately.
00:24:16 But like,
00:24:17 the idea that
00:24:18 after me a math
00:24:19 of her,
00:24:20 you could wake up
00:24:21 and then not want to,
00:24:22 not continue that.
00:24:24 That's,
00:24:25 that's,
00:24:26 that's,
00:24:27 I agree hippo,
00:24:28 I agree hippo,
00:24:29 Nate is a fucking
00:24:30 hack.
00:24:31 It all makes sense,
00:24:32 just in the context
00:24:33 of the way that
00:24:34 my brain works
00:24:35 because like,
00:24:36 I'm doing this thing
00:24:37 where I like,
00:24:38 like during me a
00:24:39 math of her I was able
00:24:40 to like kind of
00:24:41 be intellectually lazy
00:24:42 and just say,
00:24:43 Nate,
00:24:44 your whole life
00:24:45 is now making videos
00:24:46 and you are doing
00:24:47 nothing else.
00:24:48 And because of that,
00:24:49 I didn't have to actually
00:24:50 put in the hard work
00:24:51 of something
00:24:52 that will like,
00:24:53 pay off long term
00:24:54 of being able to structure
00:24:55 And like that's because I was able to just kind of relax into I've given up everything except making videos
00:25:00 Like that's actually kind of the easier way to do things than like managing your life properly
00:25:05 That's what it was like. That's what it was like drawing Brunswick
00:25:07 I would like wake up and be like there's no question of me doing anything other than just sitting down and starting to draw
00:25:13 Right, and it worked. I've never been good either at the scheduling thing
00:25:19 The only schedule I have is
00:25:21 Every every twice a week I stream and around that I just I have
00:25:27 I've mentioned this before I have like a pad of paper of like goals that I needed to get done at the moment
00:25:32 I have just like the list of video ideas. I have and once I've done one for the day. I just tick it off
00:25:38 but
00:25:39 The idea of saying okay for the for the beginning of this day the AM of this day
00:25:44 I'm gonna work on this I
00:25:46 It just doesn't feel right. I've made calendars like that before where I would say all right for this hour
00:25:52 I'm gonna do on work on this
00:25:54 But I never know like I sometimes can start at the right time, but I didn't never end at the right time
00:26:00 So the entire schedule is is fucked for the rest of it. So I'm like, ah, well, I've gone like over by three hours
00:26:06 I don't know what to do now. Should I say never next thing?
00:26:09 I've never been able to stick to a schedule
00:26:11 But what what what's worked for me is like just getting the day started on the right foot
00:26:17 Like if I get the day started and I'm starting to work
00:26:20 Yeah, then that's gonna be a productive day
00:26:22 But if I wake up and I'm like I'm gonna do something else for a while and then I'll start working like I might as well
00:26:27 Just give up, you know. Yeah, man
00:26:29 That's like my my Achilles heel as a as an as a creator and as a human being
00:26:34 Hmm is that I have like a hard time focus and like you said Ben
00:26:38 It's almost like an involuntary procrastination. We're like like when I get up
00:26:43 I cannot think clearly at all until I've like eaten and been outside and walked around a little bit
00:26:50 So it's like I'll sit down to work. It's like, okay. Well the first time hungry
00:26:53 So I go to eat and it's like well, I need some fresh air. So then I walk around food was a trap
00:26:57 They get back a trap. Yeah, then I finally get back and start to sit down like well now
00:27:02 I have to go pee so then I have to go pee then I go pee go back down sit down
00:27:05 Well, now I'm hungry again
00:27:06 So I go and I fucking I eat again and now I have to go outside again
00:27:09 And now I fucking remembered that like I thought of a tit so now I'm horny
00:27:13 So now I got to go sail around the world and find like a seaside brothel
00:27:17 Yeah, and then I fucking come back like a month later and finally sit down and it's like well now
00:27:20 I'm hungry again. You know, it's never ending. That's why you know, it's like two in the morning ain't done shit
00:27:26 Yeah, that's pretty much a similar problem to me
00:27:28 The only thing I find that helps is breaking my tasks down into tiny little bits. I like you should see me at work
00:27:34 I've got all these post-it notes that have all like my tasks broken down into like tiny little chunks
00:27:39 Like it's better at work because like there are people there who will fire me and hold my feet to the fire if I fuck up real bad
00:27:45 So I have no choice but to schedule my shit and that's great
00:27:49 Having deadlines makes me a thousand times better at getting the shit done
00:27:53 Even if I like am a big shitty procrastinator and wait until like the last possible minute to get it done
00:27:59 Which I've always done and I really want to fix about myself
00:28:01 But but like like I really I take every task. I have I have all these lists
00:28:07 I make it work and I really try to break it down into the smallest possible components and then just just itemize like okay
00:28:13 I'm doing this now then I'm gonna do this then I do that and I'm not great at it
00:28:16 Obviously, but I find that even if I'm like give and I like fail to
00:28:20 Like stick to the plan having these to keep me sort of on in sailing in the right direction of what I need to get done
00:28:26 Eventually like the little steps to do and really knowing like exactly what motions
00:28:30 I need to specifically do in order to get it accomplished is a big help to me
00:28:34 It helps me long term get things done. Even if I you know, no stick to the plan perfectly
00:28:39 Yeah, I'm
00:28:42 I was gonna say something and I blanked out something about Igma Vo 2 just something about video something about making videos
00:28:48 It's something about being productive or probably in fact
00:28:51 I've you you have been able to get like it sounds like at least one video done if not more
00:28:57 During your time. Yeah, if it's a blog I can get two videos done per day
00:29:00 It's like one of them's a blog and the other one's like I've edited video
00:29:03 I never managed that with with me a math but not even once I mean I have a huge advantage because I have all day
00:29:09 Oh, that's true. That is true. So it's it's not a weekend. I never did it, you know
00:29:13 Oh, no, I've been working all fucking week. Oh, every single waking moment. It's it's
00:29:19 You know, this is what I was gonna say the em
00:29:22 Cuz like all these problems of like you wake up and you're not sure you want to really start doing this
00:29:26 I oh, you know, I didn't finish that podcast
00:29:29 I'll just put that on and listen to the last bit of that as I wake up and you know
00:29:33 I haven't bite to eat and before you know it, you're clicking on the next podcast and you're like, oh, yeah
00:29:37 Oh, no, I'm gonna kill myself
00:29:40 but this month like even
00:29:44 Even just before the month I was trying to make a few videos like as a buffer to get me started
00:29:48 And they were taking more than one day each to make and I was like, oh, no, this is gonna suck
00:29:53 And as soon as July started, I was like, I have to do it now and the deadline that the pressure
00:30:00 It wasn't really stressing me out. It's just like well, I have to do it
00:30:04 I'm going to do it and I love pressure. I love pressure
00:30:08 It makes me a real human being it forces me to accomplish things. Yeah, I wish people put things on me and forced me to do things
00:30:15 It's so hard to self-motivate what I'm gonna do what I'm gonna try and do it's not gonna is not gonna happen
00:30:20 But what I'm gonna try and do is I'm gonna make one of one of the years
00:30:23 It doesn't matter when the year starts, but I'm gonna make 365 videos in a row
00:30:28 I'm gonna see what happens because if casey-nice I can do I mean he does the same sort of
00:30:33 Yeah, but what does he do? I thought he just like talked about what he did all day like hippo makes actual analysis and shit
00:30:39 That takes work. That's true. It does
00:30:41 I'm I'm a lot of the videos I've been making I'm like does that make any sense
00:30:47 I don't have time to check I just I just write it on the other hand casey-nice that has one guerrilla in subs
00:30:52 So, you know, it's it's it's like my ad sense has been going up quite a bit just because of the daily amount of videos
00:31:00 I'm happy about this. I like it's great. I like daily videos daily videos are great. I might I might do it forever
00:31:07 I hope you do
00:31:10 Being prolific. Yeah, is it is is um is addictive. It's it's cool. Yeah feel like you're really on top of things
00:31:17 I already miss me and math intensely and
00:31:21 You know, I want to go back. I have to go back hashtag max revive
00:31:25 It really is like like giving yourself a deadline makes you more powerful because like absolutely like if I have um
00:31:33 Like say I want to make oh, I don't know a 4th or July video
00:31:37 Like I'll tell myself. Okay. It has to be out on the 4th of July
00:31:40 So I'll work at it really hard and I'll get it almost done almost done
00:31:44 But if the as soon as the clock strikes 12 on July 5th, it's like well now
00:31:48 I'll never fucking finish it because I don't care anymore even if it's 99% done. It's like yeah, fuck it. I'm done with this shit
00:31:54 Yeah, fuck it. You'll you'll get a you'll get a 4th of July video on fucking August 22nd
00:31:59 This is not this is not quite the same thing
00:32:01 But something something that I really regret and I think has really hurt me was when I decided to release like half of
00:32:09 Champion because like the previous comics I released only like I released them entirely when they were done
00:32:15 And it was like a big surprise and it was like oh man. This is what I've been working all the time
00:32:19 Here's the whole thing
00:32:21 like releasing half of it really was like really
00:32:25 really killed my motivation a lot and
00:32:27 Because it's like it's in a way it feels like okay people have already seen it and it's no longer
00:32:32 It's no longer a surprise like if I had had if I had kept it to myself and just like sat on it and been like
00:32:39 It's out when it's done
00:32:39 I would have felt like so pressured all the time to be like well no one's seen it like as of right now
00:32:45 I've got like no one's seen my work
00:32:48 I need to finish it so people can see it and it would have been like even like I gotta finish it no matter what now
00:32:53 It's like well people have seen almost of it or a lot of it
00:32:57 You know like it can get the rest done and and it doesn't I
00:33:01 Took the pressure off myself, and I feel like I really paid for it. I hate when the pressure goes off
00:33:06 Yeah, I'm just repeating myself here, but yeah, that's I hear you I hear you one thing that's really confusing me is that?
00:33:12 Deadlines and pressure used to completely destroy me when I was younger
00:33:16 And I don't know when the change happened because like in school when they're doing something that you want to do
00:33:20 You know that's I guess that might be it but like I used to do I was I did like art at school
00:33:25 And I liked art and I was like yes making cool big things and stuff
00:33:30 But it was like every deadline of a thing I had to do was like oh, no, I only have seven days left
00:33:35 Oh, no, I only have six days left. Why haven't you done anything? Oh, no, I only have five days left
00:33:39 Oh, no only four days left. Why you just why you just just complaining about the number of days you don't have oh, no
00:33:46 It's done. Oh, I didn't do anything. Oh, that was depressing the whole time
00:33:50 I don't know what I am doing with my life, and that was just me the whole time forever through school
00:33:56 Dude, I and now deadlines are like good like I thought they were bad, but they're good
00:34:00 And I don't know when that changed and how you know
00:34:03 I know comparing that to like school work like
00:34:06 Deadlines were great for me because I never I mean sort of because I I was that kid who never did I always got pretty decent grades
00:34:12 I guess I mean whatever who gave a fuck but like I would get the project done like the night before I would stay up the night
00:34:18 Before it was due and finish it then this happened to me like every single fucking time
00:34:23 Including on my class that I finished like this January like as a 26 year old man
00:34:28 I was still doing I have not fixed this about myself and may never actually do so
00:34:34 But like finding myself doing doing this shit like I it's astounding to me
00:34:39 Like how much I am willing to just like drill myself into the fucking ground and like plan things to have
00:34:45 I plan things out ahead of time and work for months to finish a project that I'm just kind of interested in or very interested in
00:34:51 You know whatever as opposed to like at work where I just like whatever who gives a fuck school work. Oh, I don't care
00:34:57 God, I don't want to do this shit. Just like having the motivating factor of doing something for myself
00:35:02 It's like it's like I don't know it's kind of like kind of like that shit Davoo talks about we're like
00:35:07 Like if I guess like a sort of a political thing
00:35:10 We're like if if someone's telling you to do something if like just for example if the government is like telling you like okay
00:35:16 Restructuring people to like be these people to like fit into these boxes. That's what you're gonna be your whole life
00:35:21 Like as opposed to letting basically the free market like dictate what people are gonna be and let them like find something
00:35:27 They're good at and like find a way to make it work like not only will those people be happier at least in my own experience
00:35:33 I'm like at least ten times more productive
00:35:37 Because I'm doing something that makes me happy and I'm able to get more out of it
00:35:41 And I like I personally have way more to contribute to the world doing this kind of shit as opposed to you know being a fucking
00:35:48 You know wage-cuck automaton just just doing the shit that I'm told to do it's it's night and fucking day
00:35:54 Yeah, so yeah, but like but like the free market has its own
00:35:59 Downfall because like it because like look at YouTube right like look like YouTube is a free market
00:36:04 YouTube is a what might loosely be described as a meritocracy where like people get rewarded for unless you don't approve a sharia law then
00:36:13 Well on YouTube you get rewarded for doing what you know what there's demand for you once and that's why and that's why YouTube has become
00:36:20 So homogenized because everyone is everyone is incentivized to do the same thing and that's what the free market does and I mean
00:36:26 It's nice to say that like oh, but if it's not rigidly dictated if it's if it's if it's up to the individual to decide then
00:36:33 Yeah, you can do what you want to do
00:36:34 But like not everyone not everyone can be a you know an esteemed anime youtuber
00:36:40 You're absolutely right about you're absolutely right about that
00:36:42 I guess just in this case I'm more focusing just on this one this one thing that I notice is better about it
00:36:48 There are absolutely problems with I mean specifically YouTube or any kind of system that is trying to like or just ends up
00:36:53 We maybe intentional or not like steering people into like certain compartmentalized ways of doing things like that's what me a mafia
00:37:00 Was all about I would love to just spend all my time making gigantic like cinematic anime reviews the way that I've been doing
00:37:06 That's what I really want to do
00:37:07 But I realized that I can't do that if I want to survive I have to adapt to the world
00:37:12 I'm in which forces me to do me a mafia and you know what it won't always work out this way
00:37:16 But I found out that people actually pretty pretty pretty pretty positive about hearing me just talk about shit and doing that kind of like light
00:37:22 Editing stuff and that like it's it's brought out that something I see myself as being better at doing, you know
00:37:28 And it's helping me kind of find these other ways. So of course, it's not always gonna work out that way
00:37:34 There's going to be problems
00:37:35 But you know if you can be forced to experiment to like see how you fit somewhere that could be helpful
00:37:40 And if you just don't succeed at it then like yeah, it's gonna suck
00:37:43 But like you know you should find some other way if like the thing that the market's forcing you to do just isn't working out
00:37:49 Then yeah, you got to find something else which can be a loss for sure
00:37:53 But I just think that process is more interesting and productive and like
00:37:58 Yeah, like really productive like you'll get more out of the people doing it if you let them
00:38:03 Explore that shit for themselves instead of like box in the mint of shit
00:38:08 No, yeah something like that something like that I don't particularly like it when
00:38:15 When there's a person and he makes something really great and he gets a load of fans and then he
00:38:21 Consistently doesn't make something that's great forever and his fans continue to be there because of that first thing
00:38:27 I don't particularly like it, but I understand why it has to be that that way because oh no, are you calling me ego raptor?
00:38:33 No, I'm calling I'm calling everybody the same guy who does yeah
00:38:37 Because it's unfortunate when you just see somebody who used to be good
00:38:41 And now they're just doing something that is kind of homogenized and kind of boring and kind of whatever
00:38:46 But that's how they got to keep stay afloat and I don't like it
00:38:48 I like to crit before in Gava would to a ditch you get so mainstream. I look at my thumbnails and I'm like
00:38:54 I don't even know who I am. What is this Nate?
00:38:57 Are you saying that you're never going to make another video in the same?
00:39:00 You know epic vein as the tank and I'm currently working on it
00:39:06 It's just that I'm restructuring the way that I do things so that I can survive while doing this
00:39:11 And overall make more throughout my life
00:39:13 I'm just probably gonna break up my content between like doing those long-term and then like take a day and make like a smaller video or something
00:39:19 Yeah, I think that's a good thing to diversify instead of just like abandoning our only exclusively doing one type of video
00:39:25 Yeah, yeah, just trying to compensate for my own weaknesses
00:39:29 I trust Nate to be able to continue making big videos while still doing the small stuff, but I'm I
00:39:36 Don't know I don't know I just
00:39:38 Maybe I feel like I haven't made a big big video. Yeah
00:39:43 I kind of feel like the era of the big video is over on your way. Yeah, I
00:39:48 Mean even even me as a viewer like I you know more than anyone. I appreciate
00:39:54 the merit of the big gigantic videos, but
00:39:58 Man, even as a viewer myself. It's like I'd rather watch the five-minute video
00:40:03 Here's here's a weird dilemma that I that I find myself having like what I like I
00:40:10 Like it's easy for me like I look at I look at the landscape of YouTube
00:40:13 I look at how you know, it's all like vlogs and it's all like let's plays and it's all like casual like low low produced stuff
00:40:21 And I'm like man
00:40:23 Look at all like look at all the shit content like what I like what I think of as like real content is like worthwhile
00:40:29 Content is like scripted like narrow like narratively driven like like stories like fit like stories and fiction
00:40:35 It's like that's what I think is good
00:40:37 And like that's what I try to make as an artist myself
00:40:41 But as a viewer as a viewer
00:40:44 I'm I don't like I'm kind of pushed away from that like I don't eat like I don't eat like I don't want that for myself
00:40:49 Because it's like but I don't know if that's because of like
00:40:53 my like my like I don't know if that's because of like the YouTube landscape and like because of like culture
00:40:58 Like I don't know if that's me as a viewer or me as an artist because like as an artist
00:41:02 I'm like, I don't care about what stories other people are telling. I'm trying to tell mine over here
00:41:06 So like I wonder I like I hope that it's just me being like biased by my by my profession
00:41:12 You know like what I like I hope or I would like to think that like people that like a layperson
00:41:18 Like the masses like respond to that stuff well
00:41:20 But I don't know if it's true or not because technically I'm part of the masses and I find myself being like well
00:41:25 Whatever someone else will watch it if it's good someone else will watch it and enjoy it and like it
00:41:30 I and it'll get popular but if but leave that I don't but I want no part of it
00:41:34 literally my favorite show on YouTube right now is
00:41:37 Monkeys Yu-Gi-Oh, let's play that is without a doubt my favorite thing happening on YouTube right now
00:41:42 I don't even know how to play Yu-Gi-Oh, but it's my fight
00:41:45 It's my favorite thing and I can't explain it. It's it comes out like every other day or something like that
00:41:51 I fucking love it. He's just plowing through all the fucking
00:41:54 Like we're past where I even know who these characters are anymore
00:41:57 I don't know who any I for some reason something about it is just great
00:42:01 and it's so easy for me to watch like every morning as I'm coming into work and
00:42:06 You know, it's it's really great
00:42:07 But but yeah, let's let's talk about like the downsides of of being prolific or prolificity or whatever
00:42:13 Well, yeah, well you guys um, I mean you were talking about wanting to do more stuff like short videos like Mia
00:42:20 Maffavan gives thing and like getting them out more more being more prolific
00:42:24 I almost feel the opposite way where like I I kind of strive to be less prolific like I
00:42:32 Would I like my goal is to this for my patreon to get high enough that I can disappear and make one huge great thing
00:42:41 Project a month. Mm-hmm as opposed to like just just a never-ending stream of trash like I've been doing for all these years
00:42:48 I'm at a point. Thanks to YouTube fucking me that I'm kind of in that position where I'm like, okay
00:42:53 Maybe you know since I'm not gonna get 10 million views anymore
00:42:57 Maybe I'll just do two really big great videos and throw them up on the patreon and see what happens
00:43:03 That's something to try at least God your your video had just gotten like it was close to like a million
00:43:08 Yeah, I was right up to a million. They're like, you know, I know this guy. Yeah, yeah had it crossed over 900,000 yet
00:43:14 I know it's close. Yeah, it had
00:43:17 Well, uh, the um
00:43:19 Dair of a wimpy kid
00:43:21 That's that's a lot of views. Yeah, we'll see if I get it back and and if YouTube doesn't want to give me my
00:43:28 $1,000 in ad revenue, I'm gonna fucking burn YouTube headquarters to the ground
00:43:34 Yeah, they certainly deserve it
00:43:36 They're just they're just the worst. They're just the worst. Um, so are they gonna just gonna keep my money. What's the idea here?
00:43:42 Oh, oh, they're gonna keep your money
00:43:44 They're gonna keep your money just just like how right now we're having a little bit of I mean, I know this is getting inside
00:43:49 Maybe I should even talk about but like we're talking about those emails. I saw those emails today
00:43:53 Yeah, yeah, I'm talking like it's not a big deal
00:43:56 But like we're trying to basically get access to the to the ad revenue that the PCP has already earned and like they're
00:44:02 They're throwing up some real roadblocks here for us getting that money. They might just decide, you know what?
00:44:07 I think we're just gonna keep it. You know, yeah, that's uh, that's cool you guys, but and they're gonna they're gonna take that money
00:44:13 They're gonna build a paper mache cock out of it and fuck us with it. That's right. That's right
00:44:18 Well, and we're supposed and we're supposed to just thank them. Thank them for giving us this platform. Yeah
00:44:26 Thanks guys appreciate that
00:44:29 Well, okay, okay, but before we we go because we're getting pretty close to the hour
00:44:33 Let's let's talk about specifically more downsides of prolificity because that I did your depression
00:44:39 So you're like
00:44:41 It's easy for me to to be like really excited now that it's done, but like it was hell
00:44:46 I gave up sleep. I gave up sleep for for much of that time and just worked
00:44:53 I feel like it's way more depressing when you don't have any videos in mind and you're just sitting there. Yeah
00:45:01 That's yeah, that's true. I'd rather be stressed out and being like, oh man. I really need some sleep
00:45:07 I'd rather be like that than oh man. I really need to die like
00:45:13 I was the first one's better
00:45:14 I was I was just about to say not being prolific is what is what makes me feel more depressed
00:45:20 And then I realized something I realized something about the way that I am as a human being not not being like I think that not
00:45:27 Being productive causes depression and then I think that right rather than rather than
00:45:31 Product productivity making me depressed because it fucks up my schedule
00:45:34 I think that being depressed causes me to change my schedule to become productive to like to mollify
00:45:41 To mollify the depression because I'll go if I go a while and I'm not being productive and I start to hate myself
00:45:47 Then I'll like I'll have to like like with Brunswick like I was like and I was like the world is fucked
00:45:52 My life is fucked. I'd like there's nothing for me
00:45:54 There's nothing there's nothing for me in this world
00:45:57 It's time to just it's time to never leave my room and never do anything again and spend like all day every day
00:46:02 Just like drawing and that was like and that was like the fucking that like really helped and carried my problem
00:46:08 For a while. I that's true
00:46:10 I guess the only danger is falling into that kind of depression spiral where you don't make the change and start to make shit
00:46:15 It's like, you know, it's a gambit. I mean, I mean, I think the healthy
00:46:19 I mean, I think the healthy thing that that that nugget of
00:46:23 Hutsma from inside yourself and actually get shit done as opposed to you know, just killing yourself
00:46:27 I was gonna say I think I was gonna say I think the healthy about the healthy thing is to make that
00:46:32 Loathing my depression is like the opposite of that where I really love myself and my fear and like I just don't want anyone else to
00:46:40 Not like me
00:46:41 So my fear is that like if I take too long with a video or like too many days go by without a video for me that people
00:46:49 Assume I'm not working or not doing anything. Yeah, like sure like but my my biggest problem that like hampers my
00:46:57 Productivity is just like not being able to focus on one thing at a time
00:47:01 Like right now I'm looking at
00:47:04 11 Sony Vegas windows in my browser. Oh my all of different projects and like
00:47:11 Everything takes forever for me to get out because I can't focus on finishing one project at a time
00:47:15 I like I'll do like five minutes of work on on this window and then like get bored and zoom over to the other window
00:47:21 So like I'm just inching towards finishing all these different projects instead of getting one thing done and like my worst
00:47:27 Fears that people think that I'm just lazy or not working. I am working. I'm working hard all the time
00:47:31 There's just there's just no there's no results ever
00:47:35 And I don't know why not to be critical
00:47:37 But it sounds like the issue there is that little thing that get bored that get bored that allows you to you know
00:47:43 Just or that forces you I don't know. I don't know
00:47:47 It's more like run dry what I can't finish one thing before I start feeling guilty about not having finished the other thing
00:47:56 So I'm constantly like like a balancing my guilt for different projects and going from one to the other
00:48:02 That that you know that thing that monkey said oh just a couple minutes ago
00:48:05 You know about the whiteboard with the schedule, you know, that's inspiring to me
00:48:10 That's really probably what I need in my life more than anything
00:48:14 Yeah, I'm literally going to order a whiteboard as soon as we're done with this call
00:48:18 I want that I want that in my life
00:48:20 It reminds me it reminds me of those like you ever seen for like mangaka the like
00:48:25 Like the timetables of like how they spend their day and how like each hour is blocked out
00:48:29 Yeah, and they'll work for like 16 hours a day with like half an hour for lunch in the middle
00:48:34 And then like on weekday on weekends
00:48:36 They'll only work eight hours a day and then spend the other like and then like spend like four with their wife or something
00:48:41 And then on Sunday, you know, it's right back to it. It's like what what what's a better life?
00:48:46 What's a what's a better life really?
00:48:48 I guess is the question that sort of comes to mind when I think about this shit
00:48:51 Do you want to be somebody who like, you know as a nine-to-five, you know, it's it's fine and all but then on your weekends
00:48:56 Ah, you can chill out you can you can you fuck sluts at the club or do you want to be a content machine?
00:49:03 Where you spend 16 hours a day or more?
00:49:05 Bust in your ass and so the end of your life you say look at what I have accomplished look at
00:49:11 Terrible
00:49:13 The day is a bit is a bit much, but I do like the idea of working really hard
00:49:19 I mean I like time to make something that's so cool like I want to be I want to make a home stuck or a one piece
00:49:25 I want to make that yeah, the problem the problem with I'm dead the problem with the nine-to-five
00:49:31 Slog but then you got weekends free like that sounds fine to me because like but then like what are you doing with your free time on the weekends?
00:49:39 You should be working. Well, yeah, that's what I mean because it if you're not if you're not a content machine
00:49:44 Then like well what what what are those free time for what cuz like because if it's just time to just like sit there and like zone out
00:49:51 And it's like what's the point like what are you getting out of that?
00:49:53 I feel like people who zone out don't deserve that life off because
00:49:59 Yeah, they're not used to working so hard that they need a whole weekend of time off
00:50:07 You know what I mean, I mean my whole my whole deal is I want human advancement as quickly as possible
00:50:12 So I look at the landscape of humanity and I see all these people taking weekends off doing nothing
00:50:16 And I'm like get your shit together guys
00:50:18 I want you guys to discover your purpose in life and work until you fucking die to achieve it
00:50:25 You know be as happy as you want. I mean your shit together me like to me
00:50:29 Happiness is or like the closest way to time
00:50:33 No, no, no the closest thing to happiness that I found is just is just having a goal
00:50:38 Having a any goal and feeling like you're working towards and if you're working a nine five and if you're working a nine to five
00:50:44 Then like what's like and then you have the weekends off like if you're not using those weekends to work towards some goal
00:50:50 And it's like well, what are you doing? You know like you know you need you need to feel like you're progressing towards something
00:50:55 I think the normie answer would be like maybe a family like starting a family and
00:51:01 Yeah, that shit
00:51:03 Children kissing your wife. No, that's actually that's actually
00:51:09 That's that's a fine way to like to be a good parent
00:51:12 I think I'm not I'm not gonna I'm not gonna shit on I'm not gonna shit on the idea of being a family man
00:51:17 Like if that's your goal, of course not. Yeah, okay, but like I'm just I'm imagining someone who's just like you know
00:51:23 Like time off for the sake of it is not satisfying
00:51:26 Like if you're not if you're not using it to do like to do something that's like gonna bring you happiness
00:51:31 even if even if it's something as simple as like
00:51:34 You know, you don't know what you want to do
00:51:37 But you find you kind of like the idea of playing guitar, so you have a guitar and you just play it
00:51:42 You know play it a little you don't know whether that's going to result in a musical career
00:51:45 But it's something to be working towards it doesn't matter that you you don't need like an entire life plan planned out
00:51:51 Yeah, just need you just need an ideal
00:51:54 Like a goal a thing that you want to get towards and whatever people do
00:51:59 I think they're better off having like goals for it
00:52:03 You know like I'm going to do this for a while like even if this is a weekend thing
00:52:06 Yeah, yeah, like playing guitar like you said like to have a goal like you know what I'm gonna pick up guitar
00:52:10 It's pretty fun. Maybe one day you know my goal be like do a do an open mic and I just you know do that shit
00:52:15 I think you're way better off having something that you're like working towards then just I don't know not
00:52:21 Not doing that, you know
00:52:24 Yeah, if I ever find myself feeling bored then I will know that I'm doing something wrong
00:52:30 Because like I will definitely like I will always
00:52:34 Take off work to hang out with a friend or someone because that's important to me like it's way more important than work like
00:52:41 Like I almost live my life by the ethos if I can be with another person fuck work. It shouldn't exist. Well
00:52:48 disagree there, but alright
00:52:51 Yeah, but you know, but the opposite of that is that if I'm not working
00:52:55 I'd better be doing something worthwhile or fun or else. I should put my head in the toilet
00:53:01 Which is also fun
00:53:03 In a different way because I'm a fucking digital and that's what I do I swim in the fucking toilet. I
00:53:11 Don't know where I was going with that originally, but it went somewhere totally different somewhere superior
00:53:17 the story of my old roommate
00:53:19 Okay, my lifelong best friend who I lived with before I moved down to North Carolina
00:53:25 Mm-hmm. He worked at a kitchen
00:53:28 Eight hours a day and no joke every single minute. He was home when he was not work
00:53:33 He would just sit on Netflix
00:53:35 While staring at his phone and that was that's literally his entire life
00:53:39 He's just binging through shows not actually watching them and looking at his phone
00:53:43 He would he's watched the two Netflix seasons of better console. He couldn't tell you what
00:53:49 Staring at his phone. That's tragic. Yeah, when I think about his life
00:53:53 Like is ignorance actually bliss because he doesn't seem that sad, but it it looks miserable to me. Yeah, wait
00:54:00 It's hard to say. Oh, I'm very confused about what he's looking at on his phone
00:54:04 He's just like on Twitter or fucking Facebook or reading ESPN.com to see what his favorite Faggity football player has been up to
00:54:10 That's just stupid shit. I
00:54:13 Guess yeah, I guess it's not really a bad thing if you you're satisfied with with less stuff in your life
00:54:20 But I couldn't be you know, you know, I don't like that though
00:54:23 It's cuz cuz if this guy or whoever you know, I don't mean to show the guy specifically, but like shit on him
00:54:27 I fucking hate him any anybody who does that I think would be Nate. Hello
00:54:33 Significantly happier or or at least equally happy if they were like working to accomplish something and then like you know what and then they also
00:54:40 They're achieving something which is good for everybody. So like I think let's just do that
00:54:44 I think it's just because people like that haven't even considered or tried or been put into a situation where they're forced to
00:54:51 Work on something
00:54:53 You know bigger than just getting through the day and they don't even you know
00:54:58 They can't even conceive of a big old goal like that
00:55:01 So they don't feel like they're missing out when they're not doing anything probably which one of you was it that said that if you
00:55:07 Don't have a creative outlet. You're not even a human being because I agree with that completely
00:55:11 I think that was me. I fit so I feel I think I've definitely said that
00:55:15 I stand by it completely
00:55:18 Jesse's definitely said if you're not a creative person, you're less than
00:55:24 That sounds like that sounds like a much younger more foolhardy and arrogant version of me
00:55:29 So I would I would also define creative in this context as like if you're working to like I don't know crack some new
00:55:35 Mathematical algorithm just in your spare time like Einstein used to that's creativity
00:55:39 You know, that's yeah, if you're putting your brain to work in any way. I think it's creativity sitting fucking yeah
00:55:44 Yeah, the background is wasting your life away in my opinion. I want to be a zombie. I guess if it makes them happy
00:55:50 I don't know. I mean maybe that maybe maybe that's a simpler and like less stressful existence
00:55:55 Well, I would I like to believe I I
00:55:59 Like to believe that the highest of my highs are better than a person like that's very true
00:56:05 Yeah, I would say that they're kicking their their stress down the road until they die
00:56:09 They're like I've accomplished nothing. Yeah
00:56:12 That's what I was about to say like people have midlife crisis is when they
00:56:15 Yeah, like a normal life and they have no reason they have no idea that you could even do more and then they get to an age
00:56:22 Where they're like man, I haven't really done anything and then it all comes and hits them all at once whereas for us
00:56:27 It's hitting us constantly, but less, you know
00:56:30 Yeah, we're facing it. We're we're staring staring into that a whole life crisis basically
00:56:37 Life is like and fast forward and you don't even realize how much time has passed and that you haven't done anything
00:56:43 It's very true. I
00:56:45 That terrifies me deeply without yeah without that structure without that structure that the bullshit academia system like forces you into and like
00:56:54 Tells you as important to some degree that might be just as you get older time goes faster, but nonetheless
00:57:00 That's yeah, there's that but also the lack of structure just makes it real easy for like fucking weeks and months to go by and you're like
00:57:06 Well, I wasn't supposed to be doing anything. No one told me to do absolutely absolutely
00:57:10 So very specifically gives you like little tasks and things to achieve like okay
00:57:15 I have to finish this paper by tomorrow
00:57:16 But like once you're out there are no goals handed to you you have to come up with your own goals and most people don't
00:57:22 Haveing them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, most people are like just
00:57:27 Really happy that they don't have to think of good goals anymore
00:57:30 It's like you haven't liked those goals because school sucks when you're anything when you're in school
00:57:36 Goals were interesting then people would probably continue to do them up when you're in because most people go to school
00:57:41 And they do the work just because like they have to do it to get the degree
00:57:44 So then you they graduate and they're like, oh, well, thank God now
00:57:46 I don't have to do any of those things anymore
00:57:49 But then but then you don't if you don't have anything that you are having to do then you fucking
00:57:55 You're headed for a midlife crisis town USA
00:57:58 It really reminds me of at least personally how I play video games because I love
00:58:03 Accomplishing goals in video games and it feels great. I love like
00:58:07 Achieving challenges and you know, there's there's some challenges to achieve in real life
00:58:10 If you want to if you want to take the time to do that shit
00:58:13 So it's like people, you know video games give people like an artificial world that allows them to like feel like they're superior and like
00:58:20 They're they're doing something when instead of doing it in real life because it's way fucking easier in a video game
00:58:24 You know, I still love video games
00:58:26 But that that that probably is a lot of the reason why people I know it is for me
00:58:30 They yeah, they buy the hot new game
00:58:32 And they play it all the way through and they complete everything and then they're just like well, I did it
00:58:37 It gives them a sense of empowerment. It gives them like like I'm in their own life. Yeah
00:58:40 Yeah, it's like it's it's goals for them to achieve and they've been starved for goals because they're not doing anything
00:58:46 So I hate that I hate I hate thinking about that. I hate thinking about the fact that like
00:58:52 To a certain extent video games or video games are just like a sort of like hamster wheel
00:58:57 That usually are supposed to like step up on and run and if you and if you press if you press the right buttons like
00:59:03 It'll tickle your brain and that way that you've been missing and then you're like, oh, I got it
00:59:07 Games are in a sense kind of like emotional crack because you get to just like experience the most interesting part of
00:59:14 Characters lives over and over and like accomplish these gigantic goals that you will never be able to do in your pitiful little real life
00:59:20 And it just it's all big it's a big like playcane a mechanism to make you think that you're happy as you're like living somebody else's life
00:59:27 When I when I when I think about that I feel like oh god video games
00:59:30 Oh, no, get them just get them get them away, but then but then but then some time sometimes I'm like
00:59:37 Yeah, I was just gonna say but oh man
00:59:42 Undertale wasn't really like I mean I guess to a certain extent it was it had some tough bosses
00:59:48 But it was mostly about the story which is not really the same thing I guess well
00:59:52 So I don't know I would tell like make it makes like intellectual points about like the nature of video games
00:59:58 Which is cool. You know games do that a lot my favorite video game of all time is without a doubt
01:00:01 You have to burn the rope on new grounds. Oh my god
01:00:04 It's this 30-second long game where you just you fucking go and you like you walk along this corridor
01:00:10 You grab fire you burn the rope and you slay the grinning colossus
01:00:14 And then there's a there's like a 10 minute outro a song about how fucking badass you are for burning that fucking rope
01:00:19 It's the greatest video game ever conceived and laughs at this whole idea of what video games and yeah
01:00:23 Know what the the the worst and most agonizing game of all time in terms of like feeling like a mindless hamster wheel
01:00:35 For me the worst in terms of that and also
01:00:39 Possibly the best game ever made which is the problem is the binding of Isaac because yes, man
01:00:45 I know the guy who made that he's pretty cool
01:00:47 Yeah
01:00:50 Yeah, I don't know about that
01:00:54 We should if you want to he we should you should hear our conversation with him on the bonus episode a patreon.com
01:01:01 The procrastinators are TP procrastinators. I forget our url. Yeah
01:01:06 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah dogs with him the last he was on the last man. So it was great game
01:01:11 I I hate it because there's no story and there's no reward and there's there's nothing that makes it feel like a worthwhile
01:01:18 Experience whatsoever, but the gameplay itself is so goddamn perfect and flawless and beautiful
01:01:23 Like there are times when I will just fall into an Isaac hole that lasts for an entire day and I'll hate myself
01:01:30 Yeah, I want to die, but I just can't it's it's the worst drug of all that's kind of like
01:01:35 The Zelda Breath of the Wilds doing to me sometimes these days like that's what I did when I woke up this morning
01:01:40 Yeah, I just played Zelda a little bit. No big fucking deal
01:01:42 Of course, it's a gigantic world to explore an infinite goals to accomplish. So it's like fuck my fucking day
01:01:47 But the thing about Isaac that's interesting to me that makes that that kept me coming back is
01:01:52 Is like if there's nothing new to discover
01:01:54 I won't keep playing a game like that even if I really like it because I'll I'll get bored
01:01:59 But like the fact that there's like new bosses to unlock new levels to unlock new items to find
01:02:04 You know like an extra challenges to give myself to overcome is what I'm all about when you get that like when when
01:02:12 Two or more power-ups like combine in a unique way that you haven't seen before
01:02:17 It's like fucking heroin right up my dick
01:02:19 I just chasing that dragon forever, especially when you get especially when you get the boomerang bullets and the Ipacac
01:02:26 Exploding bullets so the
01:02:29 That's my thing I
01:02:33 Personally have fallen way down the Magikarp jump hole. I'm really loving training all these Magikarps
01:02:39 I'm really I fully I fully admit
01:02:42 I don't know
01:02:43 It's just something to do like when I'm in the car or just like when I'm just like sitting around when I'm when I'm
01:02:48 Yeah, yeah, what I'm driving when I'm on the toilet. It's just
01:02:51 It's it's like I fully admit that the gameplay is like just a just a completely shallow just excuse
01:02:58 It's just like a series of rigamarole. It's just it's complete rigamarole
01:03:02 Like the only thing that matters is your trainer level and everything else in the game is just a is just like a bullshit hurdle to
01:03:08 Jump over just to get your trainer level up
01:03:11 But it's just so fucking cute how all your how all your previous Magikarps the ones that the ones that survive the ones that
01:03:17 Don't get eaten by Pidgeotos or blown or blown to smithereens by Voltorbs
01:03:21 They'll just like live in your pond and swim around in the background
01:03:24 You can see them there and sometimes they and sometimes they come and give your and give your current Magikarps some advice on how to become a great jumper
01:03:33 It's really cute and charming
01:03:36 That's pretty cool. I guess
01:03:37 Gyaradoses you can't you yeah, yeah, you can you can make your you can like fuck up really bad and make your a
01:03:44 Magikarp evolve into a Gyarados at which point he becomes worthless and is discarded
01:03:50 Just like when I normally play Pokemon. Yeah, I don't abide that shit
01:03:54 Yeah
01:03:56 Well, all right, that's cool. I guess we we pretty much explored our topic our original topic being productive or prolific
01:04:02 I got it. I got it my final word on being productive is I got I got to get back there
01:04:07 I got a I think it's time
01:04:09 I've been feeling real bad for a while about not getting enough done
01:04:11 I think it's I think it's getting nigh on that time where I need to like I need to get back into that headset of like wake up start
01:04:18 drawing and
01:04:20 Then I'll be happier then I gotta drive a fucking comic
01:04:24 Yeah, that's been that's gonna be been every morning all right anybody else final points being prolific
01:04:31 In the comments say which is better me a mother or Igma vote who it is. Hey, it's not done yet though
01:04:36 Yeah, but
01:04:38 Who cares it's
01:04:40 Plus yours is the current one everyone's gonna like the current one so the old and busted one. Hey, I'm the original baby
01:04:45 I'm I'm I'm Bulbasaur. I'm Pokemon zero zero one. I'll always be the champ. Hell. Yeah, I'm Bulbasaur
01:04:52 Jesse Jesse's like quiet and then just he hears Bulbasaur. Yeah
01:04:57 Nate just got my vote
01:05:01 To me I really think Min Maphne I really trumps in Govo a to a ditch and me a math
01:05:06 I really math math. Yeah, man. Maphne is just is just is like it's like it's like one of those
01:05:13 Like what I it's like one of those brain activity charts. It's like, you know, man
01:05:16 Maphne is like a little tiny skull in Govo a to a ditch is like a little a little activity
01:05:20 Min Maphne is like, you know, just like fucking like angels shooting out of like a man with a brain light shooting out of his fucking head
01:05:28 Yeah, yeah, and like and like the eye the eye of Raj is like
01:05:32 Sure, the sheer brilliance of maybe never making a nuzlocke
01:05:38 My Christ consciousness is off the chart, right
01:05:41 The thing that really is puts it over the edges the maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, like damn this guy's got it all figured out
01:05:50 Thanks
01:05:51 All right. Well, let's let's go to our questions if we're all set with this or is there we all good
01:05:56 We all set folks. I got one good, baby. Okay. Um, let me see. I'm just scrolling scrolling scrolling. I
01:06:03 Fuck I had a good one. Where the fuck did it go?
01:06:06 Nope. Nope
01:06:09 I gotta find something fast. Okay. Here we go at Moe entrepreneur asks what crimes have you committed?
01:06:16 What crimes?
01:06:19 What are you willing to confess? I dared to
01:06:22 To make a point that Shreela probably doesn't treat women very well, oh, that's true. That's a YouTube crime. That's a YouTube
01:06:29 How dare I?
01:06:31 That's it
01:06:33 No, I think we're all too good boys. We're the goodest boys on the on the whole planet. Um, I've
01:06:39 Crimes just just stop being crimes when we do them. Yeah, I've stolen shit before I'm not even I'm not embarrassed about that anymore
01:06:47 I've shoplifted stuff. I haven't I've been real poor. I
01:06:52 Wasn't poor. I would just eat a donut while walking around and was like, yeah, whatever. This is my yeah now
01:06:57 It's in my body. Yeah
01:07:00 It's part of me ever steal anything from digi when you lived with him
01:07:04 food probably no
01:07:06 only
01:07:08 Well, I
01:07:10 Well, after Victor after Victor moved out after Victor moved out
01:07:15 I ate a bunch of the food that he left behind but like he left it behind so I'm thinking so I'm thinking that's not stealing anymore
01:07:21 Yeah, I gray area
01:07:23 I still I committed once
01:07:26 Well, we've all done that. Yeah
01:07:29 I committed the greatest crime ever once and I'm ashamed of it to this day
01:07:34 I'll never atone for it shit when I was a little kid
01:07:38 When my grandma used to watch the news
01:07:41 I would just come in the room and sit down and turn on the Sega and not even ask her
01:07:47 You monster and I didn't even care
01:07:50 I had no remorse for my for my poor
01:07:53 Saintly grandmother and now she's dead and I can never apologize for this crime that I committed over and over again as a child
01:08:00 I ought to be stoned as his code of Sharia law
01:08:04 She probably thought you were cute, which is my religion now so I can stay on YouTube forever
01:08:08 That's right. She probably was so senile that she thought Sonic the hedgehog was the news
01:08:14 She did have Alzheimer's it was very sad
01:08:19 Here's another question at exile of itch asks who would win him? Yeah, I know that guy
01:08:25 He's a dead mining who would win in a fight Rhonda Rousey or Gal Gadot. I
01:08:30 Know
01:08:34 I mean Gal Gadot has killed there both women so they would both lose
01:08:43 Yeah, I don't know if Rosie has two kills under her belt
01:08:46 That's true. That's true. By the way guys. I just happened to read the other day
01:08:49 This is a little bit of a tangent, but I like apparently it's common
01:08:54 Like the world champion
01:08:57 Should they were working but like that the Australian like
01:09:01 National team like their best national team their female national team
01:09:05 Lost 7-0 to a 15 year old high school boy soccer team like
01:09:12 What is that what the fuck is happening here? These are like the best in the country. I don't know
01:09:17 I just was astounded the best in the country
01:09:21 You got it you got it man
01:09:24 Really like I want that clarified. Is it true?
01:09:27 Like I know munchie drilled it all into our heads and now he
01:09:32 But like I tried looking it up and I couldn't find this information in like there for for real
01:09:37 So I don't know if it was just like scrubbed the only munchie knows the truth
01:09:44 Munchie's the only source for fake news that I trust
01:09:47 Did you guys see that poster somebody made of the Wonder Woman with like the palestinian kid
01:09:55 Amazing way to go dude. I wish I'd remembered your name, but that was sick
01:09:58 I retweeted it, but it's like three weeks ago. So good luck. Yeah. Yeah
01:10:03 Okay, a new question. Here we go at
01:10:06 ZTM zero three two one asks thoughts on YouTube being pro Sharia law. Yeah
01:10:12 You know I approve I approve
01:10:15 Let's
01:10:16 Let's talk about this for a second. So Sharia law guys. It's not so good. It's not so good got some issues with it
01:10:23 Got some got some complaints. No, I've seen a lot
01:10:25 Ultimate way to live. Oh
01:10:27 Now that you've said that now that you've said that Nate the PCB is done for they're out for us
01:10:32 They're gonna we're gonna get flag. We're gonna get a band. Yeah, we're done. We're gonna get fucked and sucked
01:10:39 It's uh, I'm really curious as to whether they actually know it's about Sharia law
01:10:44 And that's why it got taken down. Can we just talk about this for a second? I mean whether it was just like oh
01:10:50 Sharia law is a controversial thing. You can't have that in a title
01:10:54 Destroyed. I mean was it as simple as that or but the thing is I I did a lot of research before I put up the video
01:11:00 And there are like outright hate mongers on the front page of when you search fuck Islam
01:11:05 Just saying the worst things you can imagine millions of views on the front page of search
01:11:09 I make a comedy video that doesn't specifically target any group at all for hate
01:11:13 It just like lists stats and shit and makes jokes about them instantly deleted within a day
01:11:19 Maybe it's just like somebody manually flagged it or something. Well, yeah, but like
01:11:23 Yeah, that has to be it like people in your audience like who subscribes to monkey Jones and then gets so upset about something like that
01:11:31 What if one really I've been getting pretty doing well on the red? Oh, no way? No, I know why the dive of wimpy kid
01:11:37 Yeah, that's probably it. I mean I'm I'm I'm almost positive that it's just like one
01:11:43 Muslim guy on reddit must have seen it and flagged it. Yeah, I bet it was literally Isis
01:11:47 But literally Isis like it was like that guy that I hate the most. Yeah, the worst guy
01:11:53 Yeah, the worst PCP character of all maybe Muslims really like Dyer of a wimpy kid
01:11:59 You really pissed them off
01:12:01 The Sharia law broke the camel's back. That's probably true. Let's just just examine this just for one second more
01:12:08 Okay, so so YouTube's thing is that they're SJW cucks, right? Like that's clearly that's clear where they're moving
01:12:13 So like so that being the case they support or are like totally in defense of
01:12:19 This belief system that says that women should like not drive cars or should be clothed when they're outside at all times
01:12:27 Here's the thing. What is up with that?
01:12:29 This is the most brown brown feminist video I've ever made and I got me banned
01:12:34 Like you're literally arguing to for women to not have to be forced to wear clothes like that cover their entire body
01:12:39 That's your argument beaten and raped by their husbands and all it's it's literally because like brown comes before women
01:12:46 Yeah, it's a progressive skin color. That's how Obama beat Hillary in 2008. Yeah
01:12:52 It's not a joke. I don't accept that Hillary won that election too. She's perfect
01:12:59 How long has she been the president?
01:13:01 She's gonna have 16 years under her belt
01:13:04 How do I even let her run for a third term? That's crazy. I don't know. That's one of the many mysteries
01:13:09 I'm trying to cover. She is in fact the founding mother of America
01:13:12 She wrote the Declaration of Independence. She is the alpha in the Omega. Yeah, you know as much as I hate to to get off
01:13:19 My centrist high horse for a minute. That is definitely some SJW cucky shit on YouTube's part. Yep
01:13:26 It's unacceptable for her once for once
01:13:30 Didn't deserve it
01:13:32 Yeah, I've been saying it couldn't have happened to a more deserving person
01:13:38 Indeed indeed. Well a hashtag justice for monkey. I don't know man. Hopefully that shit works out
01:13:44 We'll say sending in appeals every single day begging the stupid fucking interns who look at this shit to actually watch the video and tell
01:13:51 Me you wear the hate speeches because they couldn't do it. It's impossible
01:13:55 You're fucking intro bit
01:13:57 Monkey Jones, that's me. That's like my favorite. I don't know. That's line is fucking hilarious. You know, it was funny
01:14:02 I really like that. Yeah, I just I really get a kick out of the the bad monkey dancing in public scenes
01:14:09 Those are my favorite parts of all of your videos coming up. I'll survive
01:14:13 I don't even know how the song goes, but it was great
01:14:18 Okay, here's here's another question getting off that I guess at ice killer 159
01:14:22 My old friend the Excalibur Excalibur. Yeah, Excalibur that guy's cool
01:14:26 Would you say that DLC has overall been a good thing to happen to gaming?
01:14:31 No, and no, no not at all. Nope the fact
01:14:34 Well, I mean DLC as like the idea of downloading extra things is no, but the idea of purchasing it. Yes
01:14:44 Remember you can have like like a like. Oh, yeah, we patched we patched something and made it
01:14:49 I mean, I mean, I disagree with that. It's cool that we're no longer stuck in the days
01:14:53 We're like you have to buy like Sonic the like extra fucking cartridge to like plug your Sonic 3 and 2 so you can play as
01:15:01 Knuckles or whatever like it's cool that we've been unshackled from that
01:15:05 But also it sucks and it's not it's abused and I mean
01:15:11 I guess I guess I like the idea of DLC in principle
01:15:14 But I know that like companies do it in a shitty way that like just fucks their consumers things like Artorius of the
01:15:19 Abyss are like good examples of DLC that do everything right or like the Bloodborne DLC and shit
01:15:24 But like like the the idea of like electronic media and you know that you can just download everything and then endlessly
01:15:30 Put out patches everyone should check out a little video by by an old man called Endless Jess
01:15:36 Who who I forget the name? It was it was in the city, right?
01:15:40 City one. Oh, yeah, that's my second favorite guy next to furnace room. Yeah, he's pretty good
01:15:47 They're both good that video just really lays bare like the the agony that we all have to go through of how like
01:15:53 Video games will like be updating for a thousand years and like it was so great to just buy a fucking game
01:16:00 You put it in your thing and then you're playing it now and all the like I'm expanding from DLC
01:16:05 Just like electronic gaming like downloadable content and all that shit like it's made to developers
01:16:10 Super fucking lazy and like now they just don't give a fuck about like delivering like a complete package day one
01:16:17 Now they're like, oh, we'll just patch it man
01:16:19 Who gives a fuck like right now they are continually like tweaking Final Fantasy 15 to make it like the real game
01:16:26 And oh what we rejoice in like ten years when we've got like oh, we did it
01:16:30 We've got the real Final Fantasy 15
01:16:32 Meanwhile, I buy that shit day one and I punished for it because I care too much
01:16:38 About you know playing the game when it comes out the people who invest the most are the people who are punished the harshest
01:16:43 You get the worst experience. I don't like that structure people should be rewarded for supporting your fucking product instead of punished for it
01:16:50 I hate that shit. I mean I
01:16:52 Thinking about like the Dark Souls DLC. I bought
01:16:55 The Dark Souls one the prepared to die edition which had the DLC in it
01:17:00 So I mean I like the DLC
01:17:02 But if I didn't like it and I bought it separately
01:17:05 I would feel constantly bad that I had purchased that extra add-on when I didn't need to and with every other Dark Souls game
01:17:11 It's like now that I purchased this DLC. I better enjoy it
01:17:16 Whereas if it was just part of the game like I could just think of it as part of the game like I don't really like that level
01:17:22 I won't play that one. Mm-hmm, and it's I don't like that it it makes me think that at all
01:17:26 I don't like thinking about it
01:17:28 I don't want to be naive either because like I know game development costs are just shooting through the roof and like DLC is one
01:17:33 Way of like them them like you know compensating for that
01:17:36 But like all the problems I've said still stand and like DLC should never like
01:17:41 I don't know. Well, that's you shouldn't rely on it
01:17:43 That's the problem because because development costs are skyrocketing, but it's not like games are getting better
01:17:48 Right, you know like it's not like there's any real return on that investment
01:17:52 It's like that's that's the problem that should I have fixed
01:17:56 I have a not not DLC used as like a weird fucking patch to take to cover
01:18:00 DLC should only stand for dick licking contest with fine juggalette bitches
01:18:07 I
01:18:09 Agreed agreed. I actually have like a video about this that will not be out as we're recording
01:18:15 But we'll be out by the time people are watching this. Oh hell. Yeah, it's a rant about realism and
01:18:20 Video game. I think a lot of it comes from like the normie influx is gaming has hit the mainstream and people want like people don't
01:18:27 Actually get what's good about video games. They just want the shitty cinematic experience like they want to play
01:18:31 They're only picking up they're only picking up on the tangible details. Yeah. Oh my god
01:18:35 I just remembered I just remembered that last night last night
01:18:38 I had a bunch of shitty dreams and one of them was a terrible nightmare about me playing
01:18:44 I don't know. I think it was uncharted. I've never played uncharted
01:18:47 But I was playing what my mind imagines uncharted to be and I was just like oh my god the game plays itself
01:18:53 I'm not
01:18:57 Really
01:19:00 Who else had shitty dreams who's that Martin Luther King jr. Oh
01:19:10 Yeah, but he had one good dream that was good, you know, it's just the one dream was pretty nice
01:19:16 There was I was just gonna say his dream was Hillary's nightmare
01:19:21 Exactly there's this one. There's this one chart that gets passed around on V a lot
01:19:25 That's that's very misogynistic and it's very problematic and it's it's like a picture of like Mario
01:19:31 With just like a list of like years and then like what women thought of video games at this time in history
01:19:36 And it starts at like
01:19:38 1995 and it's like there for nerds and you're gay if you play them and it let just like go
01:19:42 That's that repeated like ten times until you hit like 2000
01:19:45 It's like oh what are those guys doing over there and then like 2001
01:19:49 Oh, maybe I can get it on this and it just shows it like slowly like creeping in and like like changing
01:19:54 And then the last ones are like we games are for us and if you can accept that you need to get the fuck out of here
01:19:59 Yeah, and um, you know, I don't actually feel that that's like a super accurate for all women or anything
01:20:04 But it reflects like the normie influx of video games guys. I had a dream
01:20:09 That I was at a place with my dad
01:20:12 And there was another dad with his littler kid than me
01:20:15 He was a little kid and that dad sent the littler kid to annoy my dad my dad turned around and he beat the shit out
01:20:24 Is that for doing that he didn't beat the shit out of the kid the kid did nothing wrong
01:20:28 Yeah, and I felt so proud and I then I woke up and I was like yeah, that young child's name was Trayvon Martin
01:20:35 He didn't do nothing. He didn't do nothing everybody
01:20:40 All right, I know
01:20:43 Doesn't
01:20:48 What the fuck are we okay the question let's get out of question here here's a simple question at Siamid
01:20:55 Simply says bug fuck
01:21:05 Depends definitely well, that's that's what we need to you know the bug wars are going on
01:21:11 But like we need we need to look forward to a better future where we can we get we and the bugs can love one another instead
01:21:17 You know, uh-huh. So yeah, so yes enthusiastic. Yes to bug fuck
01:21:21 There's a very me me Twitter that has been blowing up recently called spike the beetle and it's this
01:21:28 Oh, yeah, I'm speedal with the big the pinchers and they put like a pen in his hand and they let him paint
01:21:34 Oh, I saw that yeah, you know, I look at that beetle and I think this guy fucks this bug
01:21:41 I
01:21:46 Just want to give all the girls love and I want to give an unequivocal yes to this question because of Hornet from Hollow Knight
01:21:52 Who is the sexiest bug? I've ever seen and I love her and she's great and she's super cute. I love her dress
01:22:01 She's a fucking fish bitch fuck that slut. Yeah, if if a bug is a woman then of course
01:22:08 Who beat I still want to be gay with a man bug
01:22:12 Yeah, that would be unacceptable, but I like it like an armoured penis or whatever they would have
01:22:18 Armoured penis that sounds that sounds like a Mega Man X boss
01:22:24 Let's okay, let's let's end this thing. Here's one more question
01:22:28 Yeah, at 5 8 Keegan asks do you think YouTube has been oversaturated with reviews?
01:22:38 Delete all the channel
01:22:43 The problem is there's too many that are not good and they make I mean I would imagine they would make people think that what I make is
01:22:49 I think there's too many here. I think there's too many period even the good ones
01:22:54 Yeah, I agree. I agree. They need to all go away. So you know what everyone everyone look up a video on YouTube
01:23:00 called
01:23:02 Bill Hicks Hitler had the right idea
01:23:05 He just he absolutely loses it on a heckler and starts screaming about please God wipe these scum from the earth and like
01:23:13 It's it's like it's not even funny like he's clearly
01:23:18 Audience feels really awkward about it because he's really screaming at this guy like please God kill everyone
01:23:24 Hitler had the red idea. He was just an underachiever
01:23:27 That's why I feel about reviews and analysis videos on YouTube. I feel like Bill Hicks
01:23:32 screaming kill them all
01:23:34 Agreed. It's it's really just that
01:23:37 There's you know, there are good things to review
01:23:40 But I'd rather people make more good things to review than to review the good things
01:23:46 I mean
01:23:46 I only care does that because reviewing good things is easy and everyone does it and I do it and I feel stupid
01:23:52 I'm basically totally uninterested and people talking about specific peeps pieces of media outside of the fact of them like making a
01:23:59 larger point about like I don't know something that is
01:24:03 Actionable or you know like is good and smart in some way. I don't know. I don't know
01:24:09 You know what? They're entertaining if they're entertaining or they're a cool person
01:24:12 Yeah, then it will be good. It's it's about it's like ideally
01:24:15 It's about the person doing like making the review and like you like you watching it for their for their personality or whatever
01:24:21 And just like you like and the game itself or the movie itself is just like a sort of like prompt to get them on a
01:24:28 Thing it's like this movie or this game is like smart and good
01:24:32 And they're just like using that to attach themselves to it and make them seem good. Yeah, you know what?
01:24:39 You know, it's not even reviews and analysis. It's the problem. It's it's just please for the love of God be funny
01:24:46 Everyone. Yeah, isn't funny. Just die
01:24:49 I couldn't agree more
