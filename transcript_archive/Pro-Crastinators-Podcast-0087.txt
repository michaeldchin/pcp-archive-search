00:00:00 The term was originally coined by James Bartholomew for the spectator to decry people who say,
00:00:05 I don't like this thing very much in order to feel good about themselves and then just
00:00:10 vote labour every few years or whatever and take no stake in actually making things better.
00:00:15 This is a fairly straightforwardly good call to action. The term actually decried a real
00:00:20 existing problem. Of course, then the idiots got their hands on it.
00:00:25 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast,
00:00:42 a podcast on the internet by people also on the internet. We make stuff and now we're talking
00:00:48 about other stuff. I'm the best guy ever and today we're joined by such charismatic individuals as
00:00:53 Tom Oliver. Hello, I am here, signaling my presence.
00:00:59 Excellent. Virtuous it is indeed. I try. Hippocrit is here. I'm great.
00:01:08 The end. Lethal Aurora Mage. And I'm not like the other girls.
00:01:15 I'm purple. Yeah. Excellent. And the often forgotten Fertive Benz.
00:01:23 The Fertive Benz. So easily forgotten. Crouched in darkness.
00:01:30 Origin of all despair in the world. Excellent. Excellent. I try. Thanks for being here everybody
00:01:36 and thank you audience for being here as well. It's time to talk about some dumb shit. So our
00:01:41 topic today is indeed virtue signaling. Virtue signaling. Virtue signaling. Wow, Nate.
00:01:47 Is that impressive? Yeah. Virtue signaling when they get a big, big old light bulb and then they
00:01:54 shite it in the sky and then Virtue Man comes. Is that what they do? Exactly. Basically. You know,
00:02:00 I'm unclear. I'm unclear on what Virtue signaling is, but I think I know where we can find out, Nate.
00:02:07 We got to go to a place where there's both the intellectual content we desire
00:02:11 and the street smart delivery that makes it go down oh so smooth.
00:02:19 Guys, before we go and read the official definition of virtue signaling, I just wanted to
00:02:25 define a possible meaning for virtue signaling. Do you guys have you seen the anime state young
00:02:31 men? Yes. So when Buddha is being virtuous, he starts to glow and so he's signaling to everyone
00:02:39 that he's being virtuous. That should be the thumbnail for this episode. That would be good.
00:02:46 It's kind of like how, this is actually a very apt metaphor, like how lightning bugs are signal
00:02:52 like that they are prepared to mate the fuck out of the ladies out there or maybe the female signal
00:02:58 or something, but it's like a mating dance they do when they light up. So what? Yeah, it's that
00:03:03 kind of shit. That's just like the beta males on Twitter. Exactly. Virtue signals retract at
00:03:09 pus. I see what you're talking about. I got you. Exactly, right? That's a very apt metaphor.
00:03:13 Just glowing. Glowing with virtuousness is their Christ consciousness sores and their
00:03:17 myrkabah spins and the dimensional energies just go higher and higher as their chromosomes multiply
00:03:26 and they rapidly become over 50 feet tall. Just like the ancient Egyptians. Of course.
00:03:34 Okay, so here we go. Here's our top definition on urban dictionary for virtue signaling.
00:03:38 Saying you love or hate something to show off what a virtuous person you are instead of actually
00:03:43 trying to fix the problem. Jane. Wow, I hate Fox News. They're so evil and they hate women.
00:03:49 John, why don't you actually do something instead of just virtue signaling about it?
00:03:53 Jane. OMG, that would be way too much work. Goes back to shit posting on Twitter. Yeah, why don't
00:03:59 you make your own fucking news network, Jane? All right. So I have consistently heard and
00:04:06 reheard this definition of virtue signaling. I always forget it. So I'm just going to give you
00:04:11 one and see if this is true. Okay. I hate starving African children. Is that virtue
00:04:18 signaling? Because I hate how starving they are. In a way, it sounds like you hate them as
00:04:23 opposed to you hate the poor conditions that they live in. They make me feel bad with their
00:04:29 insistence on not eating anything. That is a miscalculation. They're over it. They're
00:04:36 guilting me every day. It makes me hard to enjoy all the luxuries in my life. It makes me hard if
00:04:44 you know what I'm mean. Oh, yeah. No. Yeah. I guess this is good. How quickly you had me
00:04:51 again some decent. That was fast. So, okay. So the whole point of virtue signaling is not to
00:04:59 feel good yourself. Well, I mean, it sort of is. But it is to make people think that you're cool or
00:05:03 good for whatever reason like you would want to do that. And this is run rampant in our society
00:05:10 these days. And it's like absolutely everywhere. Everybody's including me. I'm sure we've
00:05:14 all done it. I'm doing it right now by being on the PCP and letting everyone know what a cool guy
00:05:19 I am. Indeed. Indeed. It is part of it like you aren't actually doing anything good. Yes,
00:05:27 it is. Yes, it is. That's a key component here. Sometimes you don't even have to believe what
00:05:32 you're saying is just you doing it so that others people would just... I would almost say that's
00:05:37 a requirement. That's the difference between virtue signaling and actually being virtuous.
00:05:42 Well, no, you can virtue signal by like trying to amplify what you already believe. But there's
00:05:46 tons of people who just be like, I want to gain social favor in some way. Usually online. A lot
00:05:52 of the time is on Twitter. So I'm going to either echo or project a sentiment that is popular in
00:05:57 order to align myself with this popular perception to make myself look better by by osmosis.
00:06:03 I got my start virtue signaling very early in life. When my parents, my dad, I think, got me
00:06:13 a Backstreet Boys CD and I was jamming out. I never want to hear you say I want it that way.
00:06:22 Yeah, it was a smooth. It was a smooth and silky jam. But I came to realize that the kids at my
00:06:27 school were over the Backstreet Boys and that was not cool. That was something that girls liked
00:06:32 and cool kids didn't like that. So one day I told my dad and he was like, hey, you want to put on
00:06:37 Backstreet Boys? I was like, no, dad, I don't like the Backstreet Boys. They're gay. My dad
00:06:43 called me. He was like, you like them. They're just not very popular. And I was like, it cut me
00:06:47 to the core because it was absolutely true. But I couldn't admit it. Now that is definitely in a
00:06:52 sense similar to virtue signaling. But specifically, this would relate to trying to make you look
00:06:58 morally superior. The virtue of being cool and not liking things that society has deemed are for
00:07:04 girls and gay. In that case, you're absolutely right. By the way, I also had an in-sync CD that
00:07:09 we bought simultaneously to the Backstreet Boys. We each had one. We were jamming. We were jamming to
00:07:14 the. So where does giving to charity so that you can say I give to charity? Does that fall into
00:07:23 the same thing? Absolutely. I mean, you are giving to charity. So that is like a real action you're
00:07:29 doing. But like it depends. A lot of it depends on your motivation. The giving to charity isn't so
00:07:34 much virtue signaling. It's making sure everyone knows that you did it. That's the virtue signaling
00:07:39 part. But let me give you a great example from recent days of exactly what a virtue
00:07:46 signaling is. Like when I think virtue signaling, I think male feminist almost immediately. That's
00:07:51 where my mind goes. And like Harvey Weinstein, big leftist, turns out he's basically a rapist or
00:07:59 something. That is a classic virtue signaling right there. It's these guys with these duplicitous
00:08:04 motives. Like again, male feminists who go on and on about how much they love women and they want to
00:08:09 fight for women's rights. But their end game is to fuck women. That's their goal. But they're going
00:08:14 about it in such a way so as to like do it through virtue. They're doing the popular thing to get
00:08:19 closer to what they want. What really bothers me when people virtue signal is like they pretend
00:08:25 like they're seeing something like non-mainstream, something edgy and risky and like, oh, they're
00:08:30 going to get in trouble for seeing that. But like they say the most popular mundane acceptable
00:08:35 shit. An unpopular opinion. But I don't think people should be ostracized for their sexual
00:08:43 preferences. Society. Just slow it down. Okay. Yeah. That's such an unpopular. You know, I'm in the minority here.
00:08:52 We don't know what's funny about this whole thing. Unpopular opinions. I guess we're all
00:08:55 virtue signals. I have a gay friend. Hope I don't get stoned in the town square.
00:09:02 Oh, but I'm going to get stoned in the town square if you know what I mean.
00:09:08 Legalized, bro. Unpopular opinion. But legalized weed, bro.
00:09:14 You know, it's funny because a lot of these issues now I don't want to be insensitive to
00:09:21 people's lived experiences. But a lot of these sorts of unpopular opinions, I mean, I'm sure you
00:09:26 guys will generally agree with this, are things that people like are no longer problems. Like,
00:09:30 for example, like a gay marriage was legalized what like like seven years ago. So that's like not
00:09:36 that's not a long time. But the not everywhere. Well, it federally has been the problem is
00:09:43 I'm going to interject right here. Oh, right. The problem is it's not even that these things
00:09:47 aren't a problem anymore. It's that you have a bunch of people who ardently believe in these
00:09:52 things. Sure. Like they believe in gay and like, you know, gay marriage and LGBT rights and all
00:09:58 that stuff, right? And that's all those are all good things to fight. Right, we would all support
00:10:02 those in general. Here's the problem with virtue signaling is that when you go on Twitter, and
00:10:07 you tell everybody about it, everybody who's on Twitter already agrees with you. So it's a circle
00:10:12 jerk on Twitter to get all the people you want to like you to like you because you share their
00:10:16 opinions. Whereas you actually want to do something about that, you'd have to like go somewhere
00:10:21 besides Twitter where people don't believe these things and state your case and try and change
00:10:25 OK, here's here's a great thing. I've been watching I've watched for a long time now Sam Harris's
00:10:30 podcast, the waking up podcast. And one of his episodes was he brought on this guy. I can't
00:10:35 remember his name. But like the whole point of the episode was like doing the most good with your
00:10:40 life. How do we do practical good? Could there be a more Nate podcast? Sam Harris is like exactly
00:10:47 me. He's like literally me. So like the whole point of this is to like mathematically determine
00:10:53 what is the best way to do the most good with your money, which is the exact opposite of virtue
00:10:58 signaling. It is the mathematical other extreme. You can't see me smirking and shaking my head
00:11:03 right now. Good. That's what I want. That's what I want the people to do when they hear me speak.
00:11:09 So like and what was determined throughout this was that for like for your buck, the best you
00:11:15 can do to like to help people is to buy mosquito nets for like Sub-Saharan Africa, I think, or
00:11:22 maybe it was like South America, somewhere where like malaria, I think was like a big deal and
00:11:25 mosquito nets would prevent that. Like that was mathematically the best thing you can do to save
00:11:30 the most human life on the planet. And that could change for sure. Like let's say the mosquitoes
00:11:35 die, then you would find something else that's like the best way to help people. Once the mosquito
00:11:39 problem has been curbed, the supply and demand curve will shift and you got to keep up with it.
00:11:45 That's right. If you want to do the most good, that's right. That's right. And like that's the
00:11:51 real shit. And so for just for example, like Sam Harris was like, you know what? Okay, this is good.
00:11:55 I'm going to immediately start giving like X amount of money to this charity because like he's a
00:12:00 pure like rational, scientifically minded guy, of course. So he's just giving his money there.
00:12:04 And if I was so inclined to give my money to anyone, I would probably feel like that would
00:12:08 be the right thing to do, you know, give to those people. Or of course, you know, just engage in
00:12:12 capitalism in general, which is not really the same. It's just like how you build a functioning
00:12:17 economy. But yeah, that's like that is the good stuff. That's what I want to see. And I got no
00:12:22 time for people and their personal little issues. Like, like, like for example, feminists in America
00:12:29 complaining about how women are, there's a problem with AC is being too cold. Like I actually
00:12:35 sympathize with that immensely. I hate when it's too cold in office buildings that like men of
00:12:40 internal higher body temperature, like I get it. And I'm with you on that. But let's not forget
00:12:44 that literally every woman in Saudi Arabia is a slave for the for the most part, like all of them.
00:12:50 All of them. It's fun how we don't talk about that at all. Well, because I mean,
00:12:58 I think the AC thing is like it's not it's not like like the fact that there are worse problems.
00:13:03 I support their struggle. I was sexist. Like, okay, it's a problem. Okay, like, hey, it's too cold.
00:13:12 I would prefer it to be warmer. Okay, sure, that's an issue. We can fix that. But don't call out of
00:13:16 your way and claim it only sexist. I mean, I guess I mean, I guess it is a gendered problem in that
00:13:21 like, statistically, probably management of most places is male. And they're probably the ones
00:13:27 making the decision. So like, it is a gendered issue. I would argue it's a gender issue, but not
00:13:32 sexist issue. Not necessarily. It depends on how you frame the frame it. Like if you say that only
00:13:39 men's, you know, quote, like lived experience is used to determine the correct temperature
00:13:43 for inside the office building. And we just like don't care about the women because they're the
00:13:46 minority. If they just went to like someone who works the AC and be like, Hey, could you raise
00:13:51 it a little bit? I'm sure they would have raised it a little bit. But the goddamn patriarch, you
00:13:56 won't allow it. I mean, I mean, yeah, like, like what it comes down to is that like, obviously,
00:14:01 every employee's input should count the same. Yeah, everyone's comfort should be valued equally.
00:14:07 So like, yeah. And if they're not being, then that is sexist. But like, yeah, yeah, I doubt
00:14:16 that they're saying, fuck the women's opinion, we don't care. Yeah. But there is a certain temperature
00:14:22 that will be the middle range of the comfort level. And people just need to attune themselves to
00:14:25 whatever that is. Realistically speaking, you know, you got to do an example of virtue signaling
00:14:31 would be somebody who runs like an office of like three people and goes on Twitter, he's like,
00:14:36 I changed my AC today because I care about my female employees. Give me hundreds of thousands
00:14:42 of retweets, please. Yeah, you're not wrong signaling right there. Especially because like,
00:14:47 again, mathematically speaking, what if two of your employees are male? Like it actually makes
00:14:51 sense to do the most good for the world to make it like a temperature that, you know, is the most
00:14:55 comfortable for the most number of people. Like just as an example, I'm not saying you should
00:14:59 always, you know, cater to men, I'm just saying, mathematically speaking, it makes the most sense.
00:15:03 That's the way we should operate. Do you think a way to determine virtue signaling is like
00:15:08 the percentage of people who respond to what you said with, yeah, all right, whatever, fine.
00:15:16 Like if you say that, the more people who say that to what you say,
00:15:20 that makes it more virtue signaling than less. Difference is the answer.
00:15:24 It's hard to say because it depends on who you're projecting to. There's a lot of people who laugh
00:15:28 that shit up. Like if you would, you cast that net into the right audience, everyone's gonna be like,
00:15:33 oh, you're so great. You're so good. Like every time, you know, a, a, a, like this whole like
00:15:38 me too thing, like it's a huge problem. But every time another celebrity comes out, like something
00:15:42 happened to me at some point by somebody, this is bad. Everyone's like, oh, you're so brave. Well,
00:15:47 you know, the real problem. It's like, well, why don't you drop the name? It's less and less brave.
00:15:51 Let's solve the problem. The more you do it, the more it happens, the less brave you are.
00:15:55 And you're not brave for not dropping names. If you know exactly who fucking did it and you're
00:15:58 going to keep letting them go on and continue to harass other people, you're not brave. You're
00:16:02 looking for social credit. Fuck you. I have no respect for you.
00:16:05 Entirely true. And the thing I hate about, I don't, I don't hate the movement, but the thing
00:16:09 that is a problem about it is that so many people, like just under this heading of me too,
00:16:14 like everyone's thing gets lumped in together as like equally bad. Like you could have been
00:16:18 legal, literally raped by Harvey Weinstein, or you could have had like your butt touched by Al
00:16:23 Franken, or you could have had like a co-worker make a sexually charged joke to someone else,
00:16:28 not directed at you. And these would all be lumped under me too. My life is hell. You know,
00:16:33 I have experienced deep sexual, like the problem is not that these things, that,
00:16:38 that that you're complaining about these things. Each of them is fine. It should be treated with
00:16:41 a level of, of, of respect. But the issue here is proportionality. That is my favorite word in
00:16:48 the world, proportionality. Just like I was saying before about how the women AC thing,
00:16:52 like that, that, you could take that as a problem. I understand. I'm willing to talk about that.
00:16:55 But also Saudi Arabia, full of litter, all the women are slaves, all of them, basically. And
00:17:01 like, like proportionality-wise speaking, we should talk about that a lot more. That's like
00:17:08 the big deal that, that really matters. Right. Yeah, but like Saudi Arabia is really far away.
00:17:14 But like the AC knob is right here. It's right here in my, in my house. And I can't twist it.
00:17:21 You have to claim patriarchy for someone else to twist it.
00:17:26 Well, well, let's, I mean, Alexa is a woman and she's the one really in charge of all our
00:17:30 computers and environmental controls these days. So Alexa, be the patriarchy. Maybe it's
00:17:36 internalized patriarchy or internalized misogyny on Alexa's part. You know what other sort of
00:17:42 virtue-sugging I really dislike? Like someone, let's say, you know, they're sharing an experience
00:17:49 maybe a negative one, something bad that happened to them. You know, that's fine.
00:17:54 Sometimes you need to vent. Sometimes you just want to share a story and that's perfectly fine.
00:17:58 But then someone else takes your story and then runs with it, puts it on blast, and like, look
00:18:05 at me. What a good person I am for like making this public and we should all stop this horrible
00:18:10 thing from happening to people and then they make it their own problem. Are you saying they're like
00:18:14 just lying and like taking other people's stories to gain the social credit?
00:18:18 No, not lying rather than like, like, look at me. How good I am. I'm helping this person.
00:18:25 Are you saying virtue signaling they're virtue hijacking? They're like hijacking your point
00:18:30 and making it about them. They're like, like turning someone else into like a symbol of like
00:18:37 they're using your struggle as a prop for their virtue. Yeah, exactly.
00:18:41 Yeah, yeah. That's a classic thing. The whole idea of like, of like retweeting and sharing and
00:18:46 liking and stuff like that is just it. What's the word? It accommodates virtue, virtue signaling
00:18:54 to happen because it's like it's very easy to just put someone else's statement on your thing
00:19:00 and say look at what I believe. What look at what I agree with. Like it's fine to sometimes just
00:19:07 share certain stories that you want to make people aware, but like don't make it your battle.
00:19:13 It's really just an obnoxiousness slider. Like you can be a good person and say,
00:19:20 hey, you should help this charity or this thing and this guy's got a kickstarter to get medical
00:19:26 funds or whatever. And you know, you re-share it or whatever because you care and you want people
00:19:31 to know about it. But there's just like the more you're putting yourself in the picture frame of
00:19:39 hey look, it's me who's doing all this. It's me who's showing you this.
00:19:43 And that's what it's all about. That's what this is all about.
00:19:45 Let's not mince words about this. These days, virtue signaling is big fucking business, right?
00:19:51 Oh, of course. Like you can be financially successful. You can make like a living. No,
00:19:57 no. You can make a living if you invent the right hashtag and are active enough in a hashtag. You
00:20:03 can be like hashtag famous because you made the right hashtag that embodies some social issue
00:20:08 that enough people want to jump on the bandwagon for and fucking be up on in a Twitter arms race
00:20:15 about. Oh, for sure. Absolutely. And it's like just showing that you support an issue enough
00:20:26 can make you famous, can make people want to support you based on that. So you can make a
00:20:34 living virtue signaling if you're smart about it and if you can get like a following based on it.
00:20:40 When discussion gets wide enough about it, you can monetize it so you can get
00:20:45 monetized thickness. Right? I mean, that's what, I mean, this is, I'm kind of going,
00:20:54 I'm going broad with this, but that's kind of what like, that's kind of what like fucking
00:20:59 YouTubers that like that's that's what like someone like Sargon of Akkad does is they just
00:21:04 virtue signal their what they what they perceive as virtues and like people just like pick up on
00:21:08 those like, yes, this is a very virtuous person. I want to ally myself with that. I mean, this is
00:21:13 like this is what all pundits do. This is what like every YouTube or like blog pundit or something
00:21:18 does. They're out there just putting their opinions out there showing that they support the right
00:21:22 issues and then the other people that support those issues want to be like, yeah, me too. This
00:21:26 person is powerful. This person is influential and I want to show and I want to show myself
00:21:31 to be in alliance with them and I'll do that whenever I can. I'll retweet their shit. I'll
00:21:34 back them. I'll guess I want to show that I am also on this bandwagon and that's what it's all
00:21:42 about. I really because like thinking about that, like everybody is basically a virtue
00:21:48 signaler in some fashion. Does that mean virtue signaling is not really that bad and it's just
00:21:55 sometimes people take it to an obnoxious degree? I think it is one of these things that is
00:22:03 almost a fundamental human desire or tendency, but that doesn't make it good. It would be good
00:22:09 if we could stop doing it and just be objective about things. I do think there's a difference
00:22:13 between fighting for a cause or like trying to spread. I'm not even awareness, but like just
00:22:20 discuss things. There's a difference between having a debate or a discussion and trying to
00:22:25 just talk about a certain thing and virtue signaling, right? Because like if somebody,
00:22:29 like to go back to a pundit, if a pundit talks about an issue and like hammers away at it all
00:22:33 the time because they truly believe this is a big problem and it needs to be addressed more,
00:22:38 that's different than that same pundit going on and making a big deal about whatever's popular
00:22:43 at the time in order to bolster their own self-image. Well, you know, it's a creeping thing
00:22:48 really because like the real issue with virtue signaling generally is it is catering to an audience
00:22:54 and like every every worse because there's money because people will pay you to cater to talk about
00:23:00 the thing that bothers them. Yeah, it's just it's just kind of by nature of the business of
00:23:05 having someone with a pain. It ties to victim culture, right? That's true because in order to
00:23:11 be like it's because we have this weird kind of social dynamic now where being a victim is
00:23:16 virtuous. Yeah, so they tie together a lot nowadays. Like I've been wronged. Look how bad this thing
00:23:23 is. We need to solve this problem because I've been wronged. Now please give me money to make
00:23:27 up for the fact that society shortchanged me in the next way. Yeah, sure. But because we've got
00:23:33 like, you know, social media in the way that we do now, it's so easy for people to like keep catering
00:23:40 to their audience and it just like things spiral out of control and they just keep going down a
00:23:44 rabbit hole where you got guys like, I don't know, like there was some guy on like Joe Rogan's
00:23:48 podcast recently who like it was a self avowed like big SJW guy and then he was there saying like,
00:23:53 yeah, that like and he had supposedly like stopped doing that or whatever and I'm taking
00:23:57 him by his word. I don't really know who he is or anything and he was just and Joe was like with
00:24:00 him on it. So he was like, yeah, man, like I just kept like retweeting the same people. Like just
00:24:04 kept doing it and doing it because like everyone around me was like, yeah, this is it. This is
00:24:08 right. We got to keep doing this shit. There's no alternative facts to be considered or other
00:24:12 viewpoints or whatever. So like, I almost want to give people credit or not not give them credit,
00:24:18 but like not lambast them too harshly for this because just by the nature of the way that our
00:24:24 interactions work these days, it is almost inevitable that we fall into these. I was going to make
00:24:29 a point at some point that this is a huge this is I'm not going to say this is a product of social
00:24:34 media, but it's absolutely spiraled out of control. The way it has because of the way social media
00:24:39 works. Like social media first enables us to happen at scale. Virtue, virtue signal in person
00:24:45 very effectively. Yeah, you have like five or 10 people. Virtue signaling on social media is highly
00:24:50 incentivized socially as well as financially. Well, even the algorithm does because as you
00:24:55 continue to virtue signal and like you show support for that content, all these algorithms
00:25:00 just show you more of that stuff. So you're just seeing more of it. It's just kind of and then
00:25:04 you're you'll be have this little like social bubble because you're only going to interact and
00:25:08 you're only going to see people who talk about these topics and you know what I'm like a bigger
00:25:11 problem to you. Let me let me give you a big example that's happening right now. Okay, and it's
00:25:15 net neutrality. And I think that we might actually disagree on this to some degree because I'm
00:25:20 actually not 100% in favor of net neutrality all the way. Whoa. But let's let's let's let's discuss
00:25:26 this. So so right right now, a lot of people just assume that net neutrality is obviously the best
00:25:31 thing. Obviously. And I feel it sort of fits under this discussion about this recently too. And
00:25:36 it was aware of new facts that I was not aware of. Okay, so maybe we'll both learn something.
00:25:41 Yeah, well, I'm not going to learn anything. It's super. It's I think you're I was going to bring
00:25:48 up net neutrality at some point as well. And I think it's a great example of what we're talking
00:25:51 about right now. Yeah, is because net neutrality, the issue there's huge issues with revoking title
00:25:57 to status. But I think so the conversation has become that title to has become synonymous with
00:26:04 net neutrality when net neutrality is just a subset of what title to means for internet regulation.
00:26:09 Right, right. Because we have so many people who are defenders of net neutrality, myself included,
00:26:16 we nobody talks about the other effects of having a title to classified internet,
00:26:22 there's a lot more regulation on building out infrastructure and stuff. And smaller startup
00:26:29 companies are have more difficulty. Let me let me throw this at you regarding
00:26:33 regarding net neutrality, everybody. So like, this is this is just an example about you fair
00:26:38 viewer, you probably have heard almost nothing, except that net neutrality is great by people
00:26:43 online and that it all it is is super important that we keep it with its title to status and
00:26:48 all that bullshit. You've probably heard nothing about that. But let me raise this,
00:26:52 this point to it. Right now, net neutrality enforces that all internet traffic go along
00:26:59 the same exact channels that there can be no delineation between, you know, different types
00:27:04 of pipelines. It all has to go through the same series of tubes. Therefore, things that take
00:27:09 up a lot of data, for example, the gigantic advent of online HD streaming these days has
00:27:15 completely changed the game for how much data is demanded per capita at any one time. And like,
00:27:20 it is like, I don't think it's the majority, but it's really getting up there to be like a huge
00:27:25 percentage of like all internet data traffic. It counts for like 40% of internet bandwidth.
00:27:30 Exactly, exactly. And so considering that, everybody, let's say you fair viewer are just
00:27:35 trying to watch, you're just trying to go online, trying to go to fucking your own website to do
00:27:39 something, you know, bigdicks.com, your favorite website, you're just trying to get there.
00:27:45 If I'm going to bigdicks.com, I definitely want some 4k HDR.
00:27:48 Well, let's use an example we can all agree on.
00:27:51 These are artistic photographs. Let's use an example we can all agree on. Maybe you're headed
00:27:54 over to your favorite hub for all your favorite content on the internet, patreon.com slash Ben
00:27:58 Sane. Just check out what's been going on.
00:28:02 Yeah, right.
00:28:03 I thought you were just going to say St. Comix because that would make more sense.
00:28:06 Your life is an absolute shambles. It's in shambles. It's the only place you can take
00:28:10 solace in this cruel world is on patreon.com slash Ben Sane. That's where you need to be.
00:28:15 You know, you'll find a friend there.
00:28:17 For a price, of course. He hasn't come cheap.
00:28:24 Okay, so you're just going to some bullshit website that's not an HD video streaming website.
00:28:29 That's the point I'm trying to get to. Okay, so you go there and the page is loading really slow
00:28:34 and you think, why might this be? And then you realize, like, it's the season finale.
00:28:38 It's the series finale of Game of Thrones or something. It just came out and everyone in the
00:28:42 world is using Netflix right now to try to get that fucking, you know, watch that fucking video
00:28:48 that just came out. And so the internet is just down like around you because everyone is demanding
00:28:53 so much data right now that it's a fucking nightmare. Now, does that model necessarily make more sense
00:28:59 than one where there are indeed separated lines where something like Netflix has a dedicated line
00:29:05 and then something like, you know, your static web page loading service that has its own dedicated
00:29:10 line? No, I'm not saying they necessarily should be charging different rates or any of that bullshit.
00:29:14 I'm just saying that that neutrality enforces that everything uses the exact same pipeline
00:29:20 and that does not necessarily demand or create the best environment for all use. It does not
00:29:26 necessarily optimize happiness for everyone. I think not necessarily. There's absolutely a
00:29:30 discussion to be had about how to best optimize, you know, bandwidth and stuff like this because
00:29:36 you have these heavy ban. The problem is by revoking, and this is the argument for net neutrality,
00:29:41 is that by revoking Title II, we can optimize like that, but we can also do all this other
00:29:47 heinous shit which Comcast and Verizon have. Did you expect them to make money to not milk it as much
00:29:52 as they can? Like, do you know there's like, I think there's no net neutrality. They've already
00:29:56 started doing it. There's already examples of them doing it. I mean, if you, a couple years ago,
00:30:00 Comcast and Verizon throttled Netflix, they throttled Netflix until Netflix started paying
00:30:07 them extra money to cover their bandwidth costs. And then there's like graphs of like this,
00:30:12 the speed slowing down significantly, then the date Netflix started paying, it all went back up,
00:30:16 and both these companies colluded to basically kneecap the company and extort them for money.
00:30:21 Well, okay, I mean, business is business. And I get them wanting to be able to do
00:30:27 those sorts of things, or how businesses find an equilibrium of power. But like, again, you need
00:30:31 competitors to drive down Verizon. And that's the problem right now. Isn't that collusion
00:30:37 and monopoly monopolizing and, you know, trust, aren't trusts illegal? Isn't that why we busted
00:30:42 all those trusts back in the days of Teddy Roosevelt or whatever? To some degree, yes. To
00:30:47 some degree, you're absolutely right. And I totally agree with all of these things,
00:30:51 you know, in practice. I'm sort of being an idealist about like what I would like to see.
00:30:55 I would love to have a free market of competition in the space of ISPs and stuff.
00:31:02 The problem is right now, we don't have the infrastructure to do it.
00:31:05 Okay, but it's just that the problem is the origin of this problem was government regulation,
00:31:10 because there used to be a lot of little ISP providers until things got consolidated. And like
00:31:15 AT&T was like the big one that just took over everything. So as to like supposedly to streamline
00:31:20 the process and to make things more efficient in the development of like phone line infrastructure
00:31:25 at the time and now, you know, a lot of, right? No, no. The problem right now is that government
00:31:29 regulations and like letting these companies lobby and basically dictate policy has totally
00:31:34 fucked up any new players stepping in. It's like, I want the libertarian solution. But like
00:31:38 this particular thing of like enforcing the neutrality is indeed like an extra like restriction.
00:31:44 But like, that doesn't get it closer to egalitarianism. I just want it to like all stop. And it's all
00:31:50 to be free to exchange commerce in a free open way. But that's not like what this one issue
00:31:55 solves. Let's say we pull it all back and we revoked title two and put it back on title one and
00:32:01 anybody can do anything. My concern with that is that, okay, this solution, because like this is
00:32:05 what people are talking about, let's get rid of all the legislation. And yeah, if Comcast and Verizon
00:32:10 and all these fucks decide to like make the internet terrible, we're just gonna have more
00:32:13 companies come in and take their place. And my two concerns with that is one, what do we do in the
00:32:18 meantime, while all these new companies magically sprout out out of the ether, the internet still
00:32:22 fucked, we're still kneecapped for the time being. And two, like if the market responds to supply and
00:32:28 demand, like if we wait long enough, and this is just how the internet is, like none of these
00:32:31 companies are legally binded to be good people, like you can just have another company come in
00:32:36 and like not restricted by regulation, but be like, yeah, Verizon and Comcast is doing it,
00:32:40 I'm gonna do it too, but I'll charge five bucks less. And so there's no guarantee that the problem
00:32:45 that we're talking about that's going to go away would go away. Whereas with net neutrality,
00:32:49 it does go away. So it's a guarantee versus a hope that people are going to do the right thing.
00:32:54 And I don't trust people because people are assholes. That's understandable. That's understandable.
00:32:58 But I think there's way more nuance to this discussion that's being completely thrown out,
00:33:04 because we're not talking about title two, we're just talking about net neutrality,
00:33:08 which is only a small part of the impact of title two regulations. Indeed. And this is what I
00:33:14 want to bring up. Like what we're doing right now is not virtue signaling. This is an actual
00:33:19 discussion about the pros and cons of these issues. What I'm gonna do after this is that I am going
00:33:24 to post this, the time code of you talking about net neutrality on my Twitter saying, I was there.
00:33:30 I know about net neutrality. This is me and my buddies talking about it, even though I didn't
00:33:35 say shit because I don't get it. You'll be so smart. You'll be so smart. That'll be new virtue
00:33:39 signaling. That's my plan. Yeah, intellectual virtue signaling. Yeah, that's cool. I like it.
00:33:44 Make sure you put your Patreon in there so people can give you money to help fight the good fight
00:33:48 for net neutrality. Oh, yeah. Oh, that's the thing right there. Like guys, I'm working so hard to
00:33:52 support. Oh, you know what it reminds me of? Remember Ben, like Mad Munchkins, like her,
00:33:57 her like, what was it, another Patreon, but her like things like support artists in the local
00:34:01 community or something? Yeah, yeah, her kickstarted with the incredibly vague like goal of like,
00:34:08 yeah, support like local business. Okay, she's just giving me money so I can buy things.
00:34:13 Live in my town and purchase things from my local, from my local vendors. You know what a great
00:34:19 example of virtue signaling that kind of hit close to home because it's in our backyard
00:34:23 is all these people being like, I got demonetized again on YouTube. Please give me money on Patreon.
00:34:30 It's the only way I can survive. That's the virtue signaling right there. Tom, didn't you say that
00:34:38 exact same thing? I don't know. I did. I did. I keep bitching about it, but I'm not like I never
00:34:44 post my Patreon link ever. I think I did once as a joke. Okay, but but but I don't say it's funny.
00:34:50 There's this one guy is a joke though. Yeah, I will agree that one time I'm being hypocritical,
00:34:55 but it's funny. I mean, I don't blame every time I bitch about like being demonetized. I'm not
00:35:00 I did it just now. I don't like my fucking because like minutes ago, like like if none of these videos
00:35:06 I post are going to make any money anyways, they're going to make like a dollar like I don't even
00:35:10 fucking I if I should just turn off monetization on my channel entirely because I make nothing.
00:35:14 It's more the principle the matter that pisses me off. Absolutely. Absolutely. But it's funny
00:35:18 because this one guy keeps replying to all of my posts with my Patreon link. I'm like, dude,
00:35:23 I'm not posting it because I'm not trying to I'm not trying to virtue signal. I'm trying to say,
00:35:28 look how dumb this is. But um, but there are people that who do that who would just make a big
00:35:33 deal about it and like I get it. I get that it's a huge problem and but to there's there's a point
00:35:38 where like I think there are some people who like have like hundreds of thousands of subscribers
00:35:42 and just lost 50% of their income and that's all the money they were making and they're like shit
00:35:47 guys. I'm opening a Patreon. Could you help me? I don't know what I'm going to do if I don't have
00:35:51 this and then there's the people who jump on that bandwagon or like this is a good way to get on
00:35:56 this narrative and get some extra Patreon. Because it is legit for some people because it is legit
00:36:02 for some people. It's also a convenient excuse. And I mean, I said, but now Patreon's kind of a
00:36:10 bit fucked as well. So it's getting there. Okay, as much as I depend upon it, Patreon is a terrible
00:36:18 company and I wish there were an alternative. So these changes, these changes that are happening
00:36:23 in Patreon that definitely are to some degree going to make people not want to use it as much.
00:36:28 There are people who have already lost hundreds of dollars for this.
00:36:31 Yeah, I've lost a couple bucks so far and it's going to hit on the 18th. I believe it's one of the
00:36:35 fees like the bill comes for the for the patrons so we will see them leave. It's a thing that's like
00:36:39 it's not it doesn't yeah like like more of the fee is the fees putting like part of the fees being
00:36:45 put onto the the patrons rather than taken out of the of the creator's cut and like it's a pretty
00:36:52 small percentage but it's also got like a small tax on it's like 2.9% plus 35 so for a $1 pledge that
00:37:00 it bumps it up from like $1 to like $1.40 which is right and that's a 40% increase yeah the thing
00:37:05 that sucks is that like let's say because the argument that everyone's making I think is totally
00:37:09 valid let's say there's a guy who pledges a dollar to the PCP and a dollar to all of us that's $11
00:37:16 a month he has to pay that 40 cent fee on each one so now that's right he's paying $15 $16 it's
00:37:23 really it's really it's really it's really much more harshly punishing like low level patrons I
00:37:28 don't want to point out that like this fee this cost has always been there and so yeah we were just
00:37:35 taking it out of our income which I was fine with yeah I was pretty fine with it like I understood
00:37:40 that going in I don't I mean I would rather I would rather lose I would rather lose a cut I would
00:37:45 rather lose a cut of a patron's pledge than dissuade them from pledging at all because they're
00:37:50 uncomfortable I hear what you're saying I just wish things had been like this from the start and
00:37:53 people knew what they were signing up for that would make here's my thing yeah here's my question
00:37:57 because like if you know because I looked at the numbers and I'm dumb I don't know man you're smart
00:38:01 um because the numbers that patreon threw out is that we made what like 80 to 88 percent of each
00:38:06 dollar and that was what they were talking like that was the number before and now it's 95
00:38:12 yeah that's about right because I don't understand where if it's the same percent that seems low
00:38:17 well the thing is is like if we were making 80 percent at the low end before but now one dollar
00:38:22 patrons have to pay 40 percent more it's it's because patron making more money no no no no that's
00:38:27 coming from patreon is taking the same amount they're they pay they need the more money because
00:38:33 they're changing the infrastructure so that they it's uh the the thing is more like a subscription
00:38:38 service where the person who pledges um gets paid on the same time every month that they pledged
00:38:45 well to do that they need more they need to do more transactions which means higher transaction
00:38:49 fees I I wasn't aware that that was changing so there is there is more money being taken total
00:38:54 now right I do not think that's being taken more money is being taken in total but the money
00:39:01 that that's right that is being taken is used to pay for the extra transactions which I mean
00:39:07 would make patreon more smooth and and less confusing but it does you're being slightly
00:39:12 inaccurate that that's not quite right what's actually changing is patreon is specifically
00:39:16 trying to change how transparent they are about how much patron pledges like actually are giving the
00:39:22 money to the people you are patroning to so when you pledge one dollar what you're pledging is to
00:39:27 make to do whatever is necessary to get that one dollar to the pledge I was just explaining that
00:39:33 the reason the money is going up is not to get patreon more money they they made an update
00:39:38 to to alleviate concerns and I read that and I was like okay I like the the the main goal was to
00:39:44 make patreon itself work more smoothly and less confusingly um and they gave a few reasons for
00:39:51 like the way the system is now people like yeah I don't know it's it's I just want to look it up and
00:39:56 you'll read it I'll lay this case out real simple for you before patreon used to like if you pledged
00:40:02 a dollar what uh we you would send in a dollar and patreon and the money you know and like the
00:40:07 people you are patroning to they figure out what fees they need to pay to get whatever's left of
00:40:12 that pledge to the person that you're patroning to now what they're doing is they're making sure
00:40:17 that uh okay so 95 of that one dollar goes to the patreon person and then five percent of your
00:40:22 pledge goes to patreon as their earnings and then off of your back you do whatever's necessary to
00:40:27 pay those fees that like 40 cents or whatever to get that money to where it needs to go that's
00:40:31 that's also true but like that yeah the reason that that is like the thing is they wanted to
00:40:36 to like dress it up nice because that their main thing was they were for the artist they're for
00:40:40 the artist yeah they're for the artist they wanted to be like oh we're gonna give the creators more
00:40:44 money make sure there's we're taking less of off of your paycheck that was what they led with but
00:40:49 the reason they're doing it at all is to change the infrastructure of the site which just leads them
00:40:54 with more transaction fees that they have to give to either the creators or the the the pledges and
00:41:01 they decided to give it to the pledges and now everyone's upset I don't like the okay patron
00:41:06 has done but that is the reason they've to bring this back to virtue signaling because I we're
00:41:09 getting a little we're getting a little caught off-path now oh yeah don't you think that this problem
00:41:15 has become exponentially bigger than it otherwise would have been because all these artists are
00:41:19 virtue signaling online about how bad it is and now everyone's aware that's true yeah that's true
00:41:24 yeah I you know I've I've been a lot of people are deep pledging because they've been made aware of
00:41:29 this where they have just saw it in their bank account they would have been like that's dumb or
00:41:33 they would have like investigated and read what patreon said to be like that's okay but because
00:41:37 all these people like this is evil now everyone's like I don't want to support this evil company
00:41:42 I've been that's not true guys it's just business I've been seeing a lot of comic people on Twitter
00:41:47 who are like railing against it and like on the one hand like I'm not happy about it because I am
00:41:52 I do think that it has us a pretty good chance to de-incentivize people from pledging and put
00:41:58 people off and and could hurt me but on the other hand like to go to go out and be like guys patron
00:42:03 is evil like well I mean I don't want to my goal is not to dissuade people from from doing it I mean
00:42:12 I don't want them to jump into it and then get hit with a bunch of extra fees they weren't expecting
00:42:16 but like you know I just as long as it's transparent and they know what they're pledging for like
00:42:21 of course I want people to do it you know that's my people are so people are so retarded when it
00:42:26 comes to like fees and business and whatever I have I feel like I have a fundamentally different
00:42:31 view from like a lot of my fellow millennials out there like guys business is business sometimes
00:42:36 businesses rearrange the way that their cost structures are working sometimes they just
00:42:41 have to make changes and and they they are telling you what the changes so you can say you know what
00:42:45 this is not not what I want to do I'm going to stop doing this it is not evil to change your
00:42:51 business model they are simply adjusting things and if you don't like it fucking leave well from
00:42:56 that's not evil perspective because I agree with you you know like they have to do what they have
00:43:00 to do to make the business work and like there are there are questions of ethics that we can ask
00:43:04 I don't think sure but uh but like again like that's it's not a question of ethics why they're
00:43:08 doing it I think the the problem with patreon doing this is that they've tried to spin it
00:43:13 to make them look like good guys and not just like this is a business decision because I think
00:43:16 they just like work that's what I hate about we have to adjust for the market and this is how
00:43:20 we're going to do it would have been much better than like hey guys we really want to make sure
00:43:24 you get as much money as possible because we love you so much patreon is going to give you some more
00:43:31 money right all right that's that's the part that really pissed me off like like I don't know like
00:43:36 like jack conti really kind of just creeps me out jack conti biggest virtual biggest virtual
00:43:41 signal in the world and about hater of all pornography patreon like pornography patreon has
00:43:47 in an infamous I mean at least among the pcp an infamous email writer who sends us yeah
00:43:55 um every single time it's like some sort of announcement yeah and she's like talking to
00:44:00 us like we're four year olds like oh we're patreon we love creators like you it's like oh
00:44:07 sad okay it makes me mad it makes me mad and it feels disingenuous because because patreon
00:44:13 like yet like to me and like to us like they're this is like they're not a community like we
00:44:18 don't interact with the patreon community they're just a service dude they want you to be in that
00:44:23 community so bad so that you'll keep recirculating you'll pledge to your friends and then all the
00:44:28 money will continuously recycle and then patreon just draws more money off the top of all of it
00:44:32 don't know what community they're talking about I don't know I don't know they they really just
00:44:36 they feel they feel like I don't know they like xylophones to them to like it's like from their
00:44:43 perspective or at least how they wish it was it's like all the people that have patrons are like
00:44:48 their family and they're all their children and they're all working and we're all working together
00:44:51 for the common goal of making patreon and they need to dictate what's good and what's bad art
00:44:56 and they need to make sure and I really do not like the attitude they cop that like I'm supposed
00:45:01 to buy into this narrative let's just let's just same side no you're a service that I use you should
00:45:05 be literally paypal paypal is all these things people have been asking me like what to do if you
00:45:11 don't want to use patreon anymore because you find this evil because you're a retarded person
00:45:15 uh the the answer is use paypal yeah like you can set up you can set up recurring payments on
00:45:19 paypal if you want I have links to my paypal in my fucking my channel bar so I have I have links to
00:45:24 do that on my on my about page on stcomics.com I mean I've had yeah it's it's not one guy but it
00:45:31 works just as well I mean I was using paypal for recurring purchases before patreon even existed
00:45:35 so like it's not like this is a new service they have but it but it needs to come to me
00:45:40 didn't you were like how do we make money and one of the things we were like oh we can make
00:45:43 recurring payments on paypal I guess we can try that but it doesn't have that friendly face painted
00:45:49 it's not a creator's maybe maybe that's a necessary evil then maybe some of these people
00:45:54 need their hug box in order to get them on board which I find really odd but it just makes me mad
00:45:59 it just makes me mad to hear from Taryn all the time because she's talking about what a great
00:46:03 hug box community and I'm like I have yet to receive a single hug from you patreon
00:46:08 hahaha
00:46:10 some hug box yeah what the fuck I want to talk about um the the the dick show patreon because
00:46:18 okay I I don't know whether who would agree on like where would this would stand in virtue
00:46:25 signaling because the reason his patreon is gigantic yeah is because he's writing off of
00:46:32 the the backlash from Maddox like that if Maddox wasn't um doing things against dick and giving
00:46:38 him reasons to you know to to feel like the victim people would not be pledging to dick
00:46:46 it's interesting that you bring this up just because I I I just finished the biggest problem
00:46:51 like listening to it like three days ago uh because did you told me to like get off my
00:46:55 ass and and listen to it so I finally did so I was I've actually been interested because like
00:46:59 it just ends the podcast just kind of ends I'm like what the fuck so I I've been starting to dig
00:47:05 in like what the fuck happened like what and then I saw dick's patreon I'm like holy fuck the man's
00:47:09 loaded yeah so yeah the basic idea is like Maddox didn't say anything and dick did so everyone
00:47:14 went over to dick's show and dick you know said all the gossip and stuff and then recently Maddox
00:47:21 is like filed a lawsuit against uh dick for like um you know damages and stuff and it's a big lawsuit
00:47:28 and dick is like dick's patreon has blown up considerably since then because because he's
00:47:37 because he's you know I saw he was at like 20k before is it like he's at almost 23k right now
00:47:43 holy shit and yeah it is like every every time Maddox every time Maddox lashes out against him
00:47:49 and he's done and he's done so in some really stupid and baffling ways before so I get it like
00:47:54 I get how I get why dick looks like the good guy in this I mean I don't even disagree with that
00:47:58 Maddox was a big asshole uh but but yeah like every time Maddox takes any action against dick
00:48:04 it's like we gotta it's it's a fucking rush to to support dick because now Maddox and any and he's
00:48:10 hugely benefited off of it to be fair I'm sure the biggest dick sucker in the world a digi bro
00:48:16 would say that like a dick has like capitalized on the opportunity and turned that gossip into a
00:48:22 comedy show yeah like that's his real source of you know stuff yeah I don't know tomato tomato
00:48:28 tomato hmm but I think we can agree the foundation here is is a sort of virtue signaling I think
00:48:35 I have no idea what you guys are talking about I think it is yeah I think dick I just yeah dick
00:48:41 did a really good job dick did a really good job of painting himself as the good guy in that conflict
00:48:46 and he did it paid off I don't uh yeah you know uh virtue signaling pays guys once again good good
00:48:53 good good for him good for him I suppose like he really did monetize being a victim and in
00:48:58 sometimes that's appropriate like if you yeah a bit you know yeah you know you know like if you
00:49:04 sue someone in the US that's reasonable oh yeah go on go on no no no that's fine that's moving on
00:49:10 if that's what we had to say about that I I feel like we've pretty much run of gamut here I think
00:49:14 we've done a lot of good stuff on on this topic and I I'm pretty pretty spent I just I just want to
00:49:20 say that I think this discussion has really proved that all of us are just really just we have a
00:49:25 really good nuance and understanding of this topic we're just we've elevated the discussion much
00:49:30 higher than anybody else has so if you really want to if you want to enable more amazing
00:49:34 discussions like this please go to our patreon and give us money yeah because we're going to have
00:49:38 con slash the procrastinators every night and we believe in whatever social issues you do
00:49:45 believe whatever you want please I'm with I'm with you if there's a steady if there's a steady pay
00:49:51 check in it I'll believe whatever you say that's from Ghostbusters that's Winston is that the new
00:49:55 Ghostbusters the old no no that's the old one yeah yeah when he answers the ad he answers the ad
00:50:01 and the receptionist is like do you believe in the paranormal experiences after like life after
00:50:06 death the Loch Ness monster and UFOs and he's like if there's a steady paycheck in it I'll believe
00:50:10 whatever you say because he's a because he's an opportunist but he's also got a heart of gold
00:50:14 Nate that was Winston not women Jesus hello okay let's I mean I got I got some questions here
00:50:22 if we're all set I can pull up some of these questions I'm okay to do that okay here's a
00:50:28 here's a point of order question at the one true Henry asks okay why does your logo say TPC
00:50:36 but the podcast is PCP wouldn't it be TPCP if you are the procrastinators then it should be the
00:50:43 procrastinators podcast justify yourself okay okay I'm gonna I'll go on record I think the logo
00:50:50 probably should read PCP rather than TPC but the reason it says TPC is because it stands for
00:50:57 the procrastinators which is the name of our organization whereas procrastinators podcast is
00:51:02 the name of the show indeed I like I like TPC just because it means that if we if we if we want to
00:51:08 end the podcast and make a different show we can that yeah that's true that's true there are there
00:51:15 are many shows under the subset of this other the heading of TPC of I mean let's let's be honest
00:51:21 just just to be like we we've talked a few times about munchy rebranding all this because this was
00:51:26 all cobbled together without any sort of like logical thought at all we just kind of like
00:51:31 squeezed our cheeks together and shit this out and that's that's the graphic design of
00:51:36 the procrastinators in general wait if you squeeze your cheeks together and then shit it out well
00:51:40 you're gonna get shit all over your cheeks just yeah and that's why that's why we're such a
00:51:45 fucking mess that's why we're a fucking mess and that explains where the the aesthetic is
00:51:50 shit everywhere all over the place in places except except get out from my case Jesus yeah
00:51:57 it was even more apt than you know than you know it's it's shit everywhere except on
00:52:01 procrastinators red bubble merch shop where you can get all the cool not shit designs right now
00:52:09 indeed uh so that's that that's that under the under the sweat under the rug what else we got
00:52:16 hey uh here's one I don't know if this might be a quick one but at stumble reel asks any of you
00:52:21 watch or listen to Harman Town do you any of you guys watch that show I listen to like one episode
00:52:26 I kind of always meant to listen to it but I haven't so no also stumble reel is the guy who
00:52:32 discovered the origin of the pcp guy that's right that's now dead pcp guy rest in peace
00:52:39 long last it's forever in our hearts uh and here's one more question from from the pity from the
00:52:45 pity section here on on twitter uh at zacktm underscore asks wait oh sorry that was the wrong
00:52:51 person get fucked zack uh it was actually at center point 360 uh asks what's your favorite
00:52:57 thing to do while sick that's an important question because you're always looking for something to do
00:53:02 while sick any tips here would be very much appreciated do you sleep yeah sleep yeah sleep and
00:53:08 just do my own thing I always roll around in my vomit and my shit and just my favorite thing to do
00:53:14 is is to have like a like a thing of like just plain crackers and a glass of water and sit and
00:53:20 watch a show a marathon a show on a big old tv marathoning anime is what I do I don't I don't
00:53:26 know if this counts when I say everything to do while sick is to skip work any excuse I have to
00:53:30 oh yeah work is a 10 out of 10 in my book I depending on how sick I am like um if I'm super
00:53:37 sick and I can't do much like in super high here whatever didn't sleep because that's the only thing
00:53:42 I can do and it makes time pass and hopefully that means when I wake up I'll feel better uh but if
00:53:48 it's like the kind of sick that I can still get out of bed and do stuff then um usually just like
00:53:54 maybe play games on phone or watch videos or listen to something something mild
00:53:59 I mean I mean everything I do is just fucking sitting around on youtube or just drawn or whatever
00:54:05 so I just I I do all the same nothing changes nothing changes when I'm incapacitated nothing
00:54:11 changes between Ben being alive and dead it's basically the same
00:54:16 same difference um okay should we have some patreon questions absolutely I've got one right here
00:54:22 there's two questions related to me so I want to okay go for it are we gonna see mage at ratcon
00:54:29 three the rat cunning uh where is it gonna happen do you guys know in america somewhere that's a
00:54:36 no no no mage there you go maybe maybe if we maybe if we kick started the shit out of it
00:54:42 we could we could fly you out I mean at at one point at one point we were we were considering
00:54:47 like me and mage flying together so it wouldn't be like scary but it's we don't know anything about
00:54:54 ratcon three yet so it's gonna happen barely even exists so yeah it's gonna happen during the summer
00:55:00 so long if it's gonna happen during the summer then it's gonna be a strict no for me because
00:55:04 I have obligations during the summer but really noted yeah it's gonna happen at any other time
00:55:10 then we'll see we'll have to discuss it I'd really like it I'd really like it if we don't we don't
00:55:15 have digi house anymore so that that that's really been the big issue I think if digi still had his
00:55:20 house we all would have hung out again by now probably possibly yeah I'm glad to get out of that
00:55:24 house no I want to expand just come to like UK and have an adventure in London but that's so much
00:55:29 more expensive for everyone you know combined I know but like one day one day we'll do the
00:55:36 maybe you have a little bit of female privilege but don't don't push your luck all right I don't
00:55:41 know maybe maybe maybe if we get me you know maybe if the pcp keeps growing and we make you know we
00:55:46 start we have more money to throw around maybe we could make radcon four in fucking London patreon.com
00:55:52 slash the procrastinators uh hey here's a here's a question one more question for me just quickly
00:55:58 uh can you deduct me everyone is my children so there you go okay go ahead there you go okay uh
00:56:06 Ben here's one for you uh Delta Cullis asks favorite vape juice what's the good shit Ben
00:56:12 well um I've been I've been on a kick for menthol flavors uh I think watermelon I okay I buy on
00:56:21 dirtcheapjuice.com most the time even though they're not true is that real of course you would
00:56:26 is that actually what it's called dirt cheap juice or dirt cheap they're not actually a good deal
00:56:31 like but I but they keep sending me every time I buy from them they send me a little coupon for
00:56:36 one dollar off my next order and even though that doesn't make it cheaper than the competition
00:56:41 I have to spend that free that dirt cheap dollar or else it's a waste so I'm fucking trapped I've
00:56:46 got stock homes man uh I got watermelon ice uh blue ice uh I like I like fruit flavors with a
00:56:53 menthol kick I like vanilla ice play a lot of do a lot of that shit uh okay okay now my nickname
00:57:00 in the patreon lounge is mom so that was the right nickname I thought no it was nom for the halloween
00:57:06 okay so I just know it's official I see um okay here we go um here's here's another question from
00:57:13 one spar and this is relevant because this is like basically our christmas episode
00:57:17 because this will be actually this will be there will be one this will be out and then next week
00:57:20 there will be another one and then christmas will be like out a couple days after that one
00:57:24 but we're we're in the season anyway so um one spar asks what do you guys want most for christmas
00:57:29 this year what do you hoping that Santa will bring you want to feel happy you can't Santa only
00:57:39 gives gifts to good little boys hippo so uh you're out of the running for that one tell me tell me
00:57:45 who to kill and like I'll kill the other side I'll kill somebody I gotta kill somebody kill
00:57:52 I know what I want for christmas what's that undertale to yes made by Hideo Kojima aka death
00:57:59 stranding I can't wait uh do you I think this might have been edited is as real I don't I don't
00:58:07 know that this was real or not but I did see a screencap of Hideo Kojima tweeting I am making
00:58:12 undertale to probably a lie probably a lie but god I want to believe I can't wait to see gell
00:58:19 mill del Toro reprise his role as sand yeah it's gonna be fucking great that little troll of a man
00:58:25 yeah oh fantastic uh tom what do you want for christmas um oh my god I don't I don't do it I
00:58:31 don't have a meme answer so I just want to fucking switch I want to I want to I want to buy mario
00:58:35 honestly god damn it can't blame you dude I cannot blame you it's fucking good dude they just
00:58:39 announced bayonetta 3 I'm done I know for the switch the hits keep coming god damn like fuck
00:58:48 yeah that that that and 10 billion subscribers so I can stop working yeah job that that's that'd be
00:58:53 nice we all want that uh mage what do you want for christmas uh I don't have a meme answer either
00:58:59 like I have a bit of a dilemma I do want the switch as well but like there aren't any currently
00:59:04 games that I want on it but there will be like I know that there's a shin megami tense a game
00:59:09 coming out yeah that's coming that's coming there's definitely going to be a pokemon game on it so
00:59:14 no doubt me getting a switch at some point in my life is probably going to be inevitable isn't
00:59:20 ultra sun and ultra moon coming out on the switch yeah that's already available yeah that's out that's
00:59:25 yeah I have a 3ds so I could get it if I wanted to but I'm I'm not particularly inclined to get it
00:59:31 because I'm saving up some money um and the other thing I want is I want to play persona 5
00:59:37 really really bad but the problem is I don't have a ps4 nor a tv to put it onto that's on vita
00:59:45 2 isn't it um no no it's not sadly no okay just pull your just dust off your old vita I yeah I have
00:59:53 a vita like I've got it for really wait you do yeah I have a ps vita I got it for really cheap for my
00:59:59 sister's but uh well currently husband it's really cheap and I got a digimon game on it
01:00:05 that was fun hey apparently it is available for the vita but it's got stutters and it doesn't run
01:00:10 great wait no no I love it up are you sure maybe I'm wrong I don't know I am not you know what okay
01:00:15 this is my mission life I'm gonna find out right now hang on okay because there's definitely a persona
01:00:20 for golden on ps vita which I'm gonna get for Christmas from my parents oh wait it's available
01:00:26 on ps3 that's that's something I don't own it though that that has stutters I've heard though
01:00:32 okay that's that's probably what it is okay well that's fucked uh yeah so like if if I want persona
01:00:38 5 I'd have to get like a ps4 and a tv or so I'm not gonna get any of them but in a perfect world
01:00:48 I would get everything dreams are made to not be fulfilled that's what I that's what I believe
01:00:56 men going and keep them unsatisfied indeed my dream is to never have my dream fulfilled
01:01:02 that's that's a pretty good dream I think because if you do then you'll just languish
01:01:06 wait that's not true life should be about achieving goals then setting new goals so never mind uh
01:01:11 yeah ignore that uh anything else gib is there anything else you want um I was trying to think
01:01:17 and it's really just I want to get all of my affairs like my currently outstanding affairs in order
01:01:23 by the time the new year party and all that like right clean slate let's do this let's do like it'll
01:01:30 help my mind be clear yeah so that I so that I don't have to think I gotta do that that's a great
01:01:36 I totally feel you because I just finished that animation and now if I can get that strike off of
01:01:41 that uh second part of the y3d anime fails all the projects I started this year will be done
01:01:46 and yeah rates so I have like a two-week window to make that work I'm hoping I'm hoping like even
01:01:52 even though it doesn't really make any difference because it's just the next day but it is new year
01:01:57 it's a very mental like block when totally old year stuff is still being done it's become a cultural
01:02:03 thing and so you're affected by it naturally um and I guess what I want for Christmas I want a
01:02:10 microwave I would like a microwave for Christmas I don't want a microwave I do not have a microwave
01:02:16 yep yep I don't know I feel like they wouldn't having a microwave make it easier to to start eating
01:02:22 things that aren't fucking cans of kidney beans oh you just want to heat up those kidney beans is
01:02:28 that is that what this is all about frankly the real reason is I just want to be able to cook oats
01:02:32 much more easily than I do right now that's that's the real thing I want dude you know what I have
01:02:36 when I have like oatmeal and stuff we have a water dispenser and it dispenses hot water so it's
01:02:41 like instant like literally like you pour the hot water in with the oats and it's instantly done
01:02:45 it's the most magical thing of all time that's pretty good though I'm not sure that actually
01:02:49 works with like the steel cut oats that I've got because like you have to like they're pretty tough
01:02:54 and I think the microwave process like softens them or something maybe I don't know maybe I'm
01:02:58 wrong I don't know but in any case I need some solution well I'm gonna work on that that's my
01:03:06 goal to have better oats really what I want for Christmas is oats I want those sweet sweet oats
01:03:11 like what a weird utilitarian answer I gotta get my fucking gains dude okay here we go
01:03:16 now another question uh snow zillofenikin that's mazillofenikin what's up dude
01:03:21 any plans on the pcp having more guest appearances or guest interviews with content creators you
01:03:27 enjoy I've been thinking about this a little bit haven't actually haven't haven't had any ideas for
01:03:31 that lately that's true I I want to get Andrew Hussie on the Undertale uh what oh my god it'll
01:03:38 be our Undertale 2 podcast our best game ever number two when I get Undertale 2 for Christmas
01:03:44 and then release it on steam and make a hundred million dollars um I actually there is a guy who
01:03:52 I've been I've this has been like a pet project of mine for a long time uh that I haven't really
01:03:56 talked about that much but I I want to interview rosseter from twin perfect because he fascinates
01:04:02 me and I he's like the main guy with glasses and uh blonde hair with no beard you know okay
01:04:08 yeah yeah yeah he's like the he's the main dude I want to know what fascinates you about him
01:04:13 like because I've because I've watched those twin perfect silent hill videos yeah you're at your
01:04:18 behest good good it's it's the the the uniquely like adversarial attitude of his videos I find
01:04:26 very compelling and the incredible meticulous detail both in the research of the videos as well as the
01:04:32 editing of the videos is definitely like an has been an influence on me and uh uh I mean it's it's
01:04:38 it's just very interesting especially the kind of languishing that the channel has done uh that
01:04:43 like I'm I'm just wondering why he hasn't like dedicated himself more to producing more content
01:04:48 in a more expedient manner I just want to know what makes the man tick and and know what the
01:04:53 deals because it's one of my favorite channels on all of YouTube that releases content very
01:04:57 irregularly I don't know that there are real enigma to me I want to know them more you're
01:05:01 going to have to lick me this channel because I have no idea who you're talking about I will
01:05:05 twin perfect youtube search youtube search uh the real silent hill experience there's a playlist
01:05:10 just start watching it it is like it is like an 18 or 17 episode long gauntlet of like some gigantic
01:05:18 videos it kind of it kind of falls apart at the end but whatever nah yeah it does there's like a
01:05:24 podcast in there well okay that that yeah is it like a let's play or is it like no no no no no no
01:05:30 it's like a long analytical thing okay it's it's on youtube the merits of silent hill 2 it basically
01:05:36 it's it's a it goes through the whole series the whole series yeah it just discuss it in great
01:05:40 detail I was pretty interested by even despite that I've never played a silent hill before
01:05:45 watching those is what maybe you want to play sound hill and then I did so they're they're real good
01:05:48 they're real good uh in any case that so that's that's like an idea I've had and I actually
01:05:52 messaged rosseter once before but he just didn't reply but now that I am now that I've officially
01:05:57 passed twin perfect insubscribers perhaps now he'll pay attention to me and give a shit about me
01:06:03 we'll see will I pay attention to you when you're the senpai yeah exactly the co has become the senpai
01:06:13 I just realized I didn't credit the people that I asked and answered the questions too so quickly
01:06:18 oh okay the the person who asked if I was going to be in radclan was daxter from patreon lounge
01:06:24 and Ken majored out me person was squid mika from patreon lounge excellent um I okay I think that's
01:06:32 going to do it I'm not seeing any other questions here okay not about me okay back what was each of
01:06:39 your best parts of 2017 both professionally and personally oh that's a good question that is a
01:06:44 good question buy a one spar on uh let's go first yeah I think for mine it was following after me
01:06:52 and math of uh it was you know it's dark demon blood month bro and then Igmovo to a ditch that was like
01:06:58 that was a lot of videos and that was really stressful but it was cool that I did it some
01:07:02 stressful and some of those dark the just some of those dark demon blood month videos are really
01:07:06 good still damn right they are and the thumbnail to the first one for demon stills is still like
01:07:11 one of my favorite thumbnails of all time a demon an arrow to the demon oh it's excellent uh this has
01:07:20 been a huge year for me obviously uh me and mafa was was was uh crazy was huge was big uh but actually
01:07:28 like the channel doubled in size of course with the galco video beforehand where I finally broke
01:07:32 like it was funny like all these barriers like kind of broke all at the same time around like may
01:07:37 this year were like I had never I remember like I had been saying on twitter and stuff
01:07:41 I so I'm so close to 17 000 subscribers the old goal that that uh tbap never reached I want to
01:07:46 break that that's my goal and then I did and then immediately galco came out and over the next like
01:07:51 couple of couple of days and weeks my channel more than doubled in size like 40 000 and then um
01:07:59 yeah fuck and then just like me and mafa was already happening because I already planned it
01:08:02 before galco came out and that was that was big that made people like aware of my channel as
01:08:07 like a thing that was it was going to update regularly and now I'm I've just like learned
01:08:11 from those experiences and I made a couple videos and now I'm doing we agua and things have never
01:08:15 been better in terms of the online stuff yeah it's real great it's real great oh also we all
01:08:20 started the pcp uh patreon this year and that was definitely god that was only this year that was
01:08:25 only this year it was only this year it was like march or something yeah she it yep yep yep um
01:08:32 well I mean I finished champion chapter one finally uh which was great I finished a nuzloc
01:08:39 conquest which was a relief oh yeah I was so glad when that was over um yeah good stuff good stuff
01:08:48 yeah um I think my favorite like professional thing that I did this year was just learning 3d
01:08:52 like I've I've told myself I wanted to learn I was gonna make a video about this actually today
01:08:56 just talking about it because I just released the animation uh but I've wanted to do 3d since 2006
01:09:00 and I always told myself I was too dumb to do it and this year I finally nut it up and I went from
01:09:04 knowing nothing about it to making an animation in 11 months so way to go dude that was cool
01:09:10 and I really love your little uh the little gifts like rotations of like little models you make
01:09:16 oh tom yeah the the thing the animation went up today right uh you went up yesterday actually
01:09:22 okay I haven't seen it yet so I gotta I thought it was pretty impressed though I want to watch it
01:09:25 again because I could only quickly watch it at the time yeah it's not I mean there's room for
01:09:30 improvement but in terms of just like getting it out look pretty smooth I noticed that hips way I
01:09:34 noticed that hips way going on which which channel was it on uh it's on my main channel it's on
01:09:40 it's funny you say that hips way is good because I had a guy uh who I woke up to this guy who looks
01:09:44 like a huge essay comment saying he was quote a professional animator and did a shot by shot
01:09:50 breakdown of how terrible it was well that's kind of a compliment I suppose in its own way it's his
01:09:55 comment was a fuck you I thought you were good at art what is dude what the fuck that it's it's
01:10:01 it's really all right I saw that comment as well it's basically he he copied it from a discord
01:10:06 where he was discussing it among people yeah and he pasted it but he didn't take out like the the
01:10:12 colloquial things he was saying to his friends about how tom in in the third person is terrible
01:10:17 yeah it was it was the worst thing and then I called him on it I called him on it he's like yeah
01:10:23 that's exactly what happened and then he messaged me on twitter's like I'm sorry I'm like yeah fuck
01:10:26 you well okay that's nice but yeah some of the some of the criticisms he had was you know they
01:10:33 they they they they were all right like there was tons of good good ideas in there for improving
01:10:37 sandwich between you're a fucking retard so that was fun but that that my favorite like
01:10:44 professional thing was was a 3d my favorite personal thing this year was definitely uh
01:10:48 rad country watching mad bull with everybody oh i forgot rad country was this year guys remember
01:10:53 that i remember now but yeah it was fucking january jeez Louise yeah i miss those days soon for me
01:11:02 personally i think i mentioned that in the last podcast when i got my health in order like at the
01:11:07 end of um may or so that was that was like the best that's a huge deal major's out there major's
01:11:16 out there grinded random pokemon with her whole team either dead or at low hp so she finally visited
01:11:21 nurse joy and everything's in top shape once again yes i was visited the pokemon center finally
01:11:30 professionally i i don't know like i feel like it all fell into place this year you had like two
01:11:35 videos hit a million views this year yeah it's nice yeah that's insane i i am i i had to i had to
01:11:42 turn off comments on one of the videos because driving insane like i don't want to like um what
01:11:48 would they do it or they tell what were they saying smack about it's like it's like the same
01:11:52 comments every now like every every day i wake up to the same exact comments and i have to reply
01:11:58 with the same exact same thing and like we don't have to like i know i don't have to but like i was
01:12:03 i just i had to i've i've stopped i've stopped uh i get i get a ton of comments on the christian
01:12:10 video to this day and like i but i haven't replied to one in a long time i i do like that comment
01:12:16 that was like uh man this video is great too bad about the autists you know just like that you
01:12:20 have to look at and and experience yeah yeah uh those are my favorites he loves those fucking
01:12:25 odd he's watching a christian video he loves autistic people fuck that someone someone commented
01:12:30 like like a couple days ago and said like i watch this video like every like every two weeks
01:12:36 and i i i almost i almost commented like thanks for the clicks or like thanks for the views dude
01:12:41 thanks for the watch time that's nice that's nice because like i do want because because like when
01:12:45 people legitimately like it i want to yeah i want to like tell them you know i'm thanks i'm glad you
01:12:50 enjoy this but there's just so many there's so many when i see when i see comments like that like
01:12:54 the king of hearts video was out this year and that was also great but whenever i get a mean
01:12:58 comments on anything or rather when i get a really nice comment that i'd like to be like oh thanks
01:13:02 dude or anything like that i i generally suppress the urge because i don't want the people leaving
01:13:07 mean comments to know that i'm reading their comments and only replying to the nice ones i
01:13:11 don't want to give them that yeah no i never i would never reply to like a shitty comment or a
01:13:16 comment criticizing me because it's like yeah yeah we don't we don't we don't need to give them what
01:13:20 they want we don't need to spare those any attention no my favorite thing to do with mean
01:13:24 comments is to reply nicely because they don't know what to do after that that's always fun because
01:13:28 if they respond they're just like uh if if fuck if they do uh they are in fact the fool i usually
01:13:34 reply by making their attitude or make fun of them i don't know like it really depends on the comment
01:13:40 like sometimes i don't reply at all if it's just not worth my time sometimes maybe if i feel
01:13:45 feel like i have something to say i say it but if someone if someone just seriously if someone
01:13:50 just comments in a way that's like they don't like me then i just don't respond because like
01:13:54 right or whatever but if but if it's someone like if it's someone who's like criticizing or
01:13:58 saying something that's like wrong or like making some kind of some kind of like claim that's wrong
01:14:04 and like then i'll reply and be like listen yeah let me set the record straight on this because like
01:14:09 i don't want people reading this comment and and believing it i'm always tempted to reply to those
01:14:14 sorts of things but generally i find myself replying more to i mean if this is rare this is
01:14:18 like the rarest breed but like someone making like a substantive sincere criticism of like any
01:14:24 point or whatever those i will reply to uh sometimes not i want to say quickly uh it's like um if people
01:14:32 like post like super angry or or something like comments like that like one of my favorite things
01:14:38 to play with is just lol that that's all i i don't want to do that because i feel like that gives
01:14:45 them what they want they got your attention no i just like they never reply they never reply to
01:14:50 it though like i haven't had a person reply to lol to lol well fair enough if it works for you then
01:14:56 but godspeed uh i don't always but sometimes i do well um any more questions i think that's about
01:15:06 it i think we've tapped out you have something to say i think i feel like he had i was it was just
01:15:12 about a comment thing um but i don't know the moment feels like it's past you can say it's okay i
01:15:18 want to hear it give i want to hear that shit tell me about the comment oh okay who are you
01:15:25 the the fucking uh i had a comment recently uh on my ape escape part three uh video
01:15:32 saying it was the worst one i ever made and i was the worst video ever i felt terrible yeah i saw
01:15:37 that i wanted to kill him yeah but um has he even seen a g r p j i mean i i love g r p j i honestly
01:15:46 i wish you would make more g r p j yeah me too me me too um anyway uh there was two people who
01:15:52 asked that said that and i was like oh i'm gonna respond because i i just i just really want to
01:15:58 know like why why why is it the worst one and i felt better just asking him so what didn't you
01:16:04 like about it and then he replied with more specifics and i was like okay that actually makes me feel
01:16:09 better knowing it precisely what was wrong yeah because it's no longer like an ephemeral thing of
01:16:16 like you're terrible now it's like okay he's like specific criticisms like these can be changed or
01:16:21 you know i can totally relate uh one of the comments i got on the the video that i disabled
01:16:27 the comments on like it's not necessarily a bad comment it's not the reason i disabled comments
01:16:31 it's just like um and they come to someone like oh well where the fuck did that at enemy go and i'm
01:16:37 like what's the problem with it and they were like oh and that specific point uh uh his head
01:16:44 seems a bit too big and i was like yeah that's a fair point uh you could have just started with that
01:16:49 and they're like i'm sorry about being too direct i was like see that the problem was that you
01:16:54 weren't direct enough right exactly yeah it's just like the commenter atmosphere you know like we
01:16:59 we got to change the commenter culture guys make it work it's it's really just that people think
01:17:04 that they're not going to have uh to respond to a reply about it so they don't feel the need to
01:17:10 make it clear the first time and i just throwing it out there we all love a little bit of shit posting
01:17:15 down again yeah well all right i guess that's it everybody i think we're i think we're we're concluded

01:18:40 asked for and then i checked the google play downloads yesterday it's like three yeah exactly
01:18:46 i don't i don't know what the fuck you people are talking about making me work to the bone
01:18:50 maybe itunes is more i don't know maybe i i was agonized over the itunes things for like a year
01:18:55 it was it was a lot of work and it still isn't it's it's more work than it should be getting them up
01:18:59 and the dumb thing is itunes doesn't track your downloads so i gotta dig in the blue hose to find
01:19:03 out downloads for itunes which is her moronic regrettable i found no the reason i found out is
01:19:09 that itunes like apple has one guy in charge of all of podcasts because they don't because they
01:19:14 don't make any money off of it they don't give a fuck so one guy's in charge of the entire thing
01:19:18 yeah i guess that makes sense okay well now we know that's why capitalism works baby if you
