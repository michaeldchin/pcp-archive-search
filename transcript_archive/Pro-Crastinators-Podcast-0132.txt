00:34:50 That is me and no, I did not know that with that I see I feel that this is the big difference maker
00:34:57 And this is the big meta thing that it is a huge
00:35:00 This is which because like and then the the the vessel there with that's where your choices don't matter
00:35:05 But that's because you're not that's that's exactly him
00:35:10 Because the vessel took you the player out of the equation by ripping out the soul aka hearts putting in the cage
00:35:17 So
00:35:22 The fact that that is there and the things that that imply I feel that's going to be what Delta rune is about like agency of players
00:35:30 Surely we'll know one day. I hope one day. I hope to know what I can't wait to play this one
00:35:35 I'm 40 and really finally get the answer to this question. Well, we'll get on PCP episode. What let me just let me just ask you guys this
00:35:42 Everybody does that make a big difference to you. Does that it make you well?
00:35:46 It gives me hope about makes it encourages me that there is more going on here
00:35:51 Yeah, I want to tell you and because Tom brought up the the YA thing
00:35:56 Cuz like a big part of the discussion we were having when we were playing this game is that I kept calling it like youth fiction that like
00:36:02 I was comparing it to like Harry Potter and like that level of very childish
00:36:10 Characterization and theming and I didn't mean this as an insult to Toby Fox's
00:36:17 Inspiration because I feel like this is a game that he probably wrote that dude's youngest fuck, right?
00:36:22 Like how old is 25 maybe now or something? I don't know. Yes. So so at yeah
00:36:28 2012 that he wrote this he's a he's a baby, you know and like this game feels like
00:36:35 someone who's
00:36:37 Trying to express his very personal experiences the fact that the the the big
00:36:43 Wham line the arc words of this game are quiet people piss me off
00:36:49 Is that what it is? Your choices don't matter is like the I mean
00:36:53 That line is repeated twice. It's repeated. Yeah, several times
00:36:57 It has said quiet people piss me off first by Susie and then by I think yeah and both at very important moments, you know big dramatic
00:37:05 pulls and
00:37:07 this is
00:37:09 This is clearly a game about
00:37:12 Otherness about being like an outcast Susie is this character is very angry about the fact not that she
00:37:18 That that people don't accept her for being who she is, you know that she she thinks everyone's already drawn their conclusions about her before
00:37:26 They meet her that like I think Toby was very inspired to make this game based on his experiences as a human
00:37:34 You know clearly this is a game
00:37:37 You fucking take one look at Toby Fox. Obviously. He's a quiet fucking nerdy motherfucker who's been bullied his whole life
00:37:42 So like this game means something to him. I'm sure never
00:37:46 but like but also I
00:37:49 Feel like when I looked at this game
00:37:52 I saw Toby trying to work through something like trying to work through his past and get this off of his chest finally
00:37:58 But he's doing it in a very
00:38:02 Basic and generic way and I don't even mean that as an insult like sure. Let's find it's it's well
00:38:09 Constructed. He's telling the story as well as any other youth novelist would it's as good as Harry Potter
00:38:16 I'm 27. I don't need to read fucking Harry Potter. All right. Let's get into that. This is what I care about most of all
00:38:21 Okay, what made Undertale one of my favorite games of all time. I played Ben turned me on to the demo. He just said it's great
00:38:28 Nate go play it. I said, okay, I play it. I'm fighting Toriel. I get the and I killer and I get a bad ending
00:38:34 I'm like, okay, I'm gonna try this again and not killer. See what happens. I spare Toriel this time
00:38:39 And Flowey tells me like lol, you think you can just like not killer. I remember what you did
00:38:44 I'm like, what what what are you talking about? I and you know and then like whatever I do a pacifist run
00:38:49 I see that everything changes. I do a genocide run and I see that
00:38:53 Oh my god this and it really it was the genocide run when the demo came out
00:38:59 That was the thing that made me think wow, this game is not afraid to go there. This is bold
00:39:04 This is creative. I've never seen this done in this way before
00:39:07 This could be and at that point I was truly excited and had no I did not think for a second
00:39:13 It was going to be as good as my expectations were and then it was better than them
00:39:18 Because it it did as much as you could do with that concept and I personally love the moment-to-moment
00:39:25 Like world exploration of undertale. I love all the flavor
00:39:28 I love the fact that there's an ultra mega secret boss. You can fight if you do a bunch of you know
00:39:32 Genocidal shit. It's so fun for me. I love that game
00:39:36 But the thing that made undertale so great was the degree of choice you have and like your own
00:39:43 Responsibility for your choices now
00:39:45 I current once I discovered that you can move the heart thing at the end after you know
00:39:49 Kara rips it out or what at Chris Bessel whatever that implies to me
00:39:53 Okay, Toby is smarter than me and he has things planned this man made undertale
00:39:58 I'm not going to under a smarter than you but at least yeah smart enough to appeal to you
00:40:03 I think okay playing this demo. Yeah, I feel like there is potential for this game to be better than undertale
00:40:11 There's just so much more going on that like if he if he did to this game what he did to undertale
00:40:18 It will be better, but it's just a matter of like we don't know that yet because it's a fucking demo
00:40:23 You know, see I completely agree and I think you're right and frankly. I'm more scared now that this game
00:40:28 I mean my my expectations were so high for undertale and it bet them
00:40:33 I don't like is it possible to do that twice in a row? Oh god. I don't know but more importantly than that
00:40:38 The the main conceit of the undertale demo
00:40:41 I understood and couldn't and was like this is the coolest thing I've ever seen
00:40:45 The conceit of this demo is that your choices don't matter and I know he'll subvert it in some way
00:40:52 But like what so I played through the game a second time doing it effectively a genocide run and I was disgusted
00:40:59 I had heard this and I tested to see I think I know what you're gonna say
00:41:02 Literally you have the ability to do a genocide run in
00:41:06 In undertale in the demo and the fact you could was amazing and incredible
00:41:10 I loved it you don't even have any of those kind of option like when what I when I played through the first time
00:41:16 I was like, oh man, I have to this is a creative thing Susie who's a member of my team
00:41:20 I have to prevent her from killing enemies to get the pacifist run by far the coolest thing by far
00:41:27 Absolutely the best thing about the game and then I played a quote-unquote genocide run and found I couldn't even kill people when I tried to and
00:41:37 Was like well that just completely invalidated all the effort I put in in my fucking pacifist run and I was
00:41:44 Like that was a terrible betrayal to me of
00:41:47 What I hoped the consequences of my actions to be Rob me of agency which is why it's extra weird
00:41:53 Yeah, that afterwards Toby puts out this statement
00:41:56 That's like I hope people don't play this game with the expectation that it'll be like undertale that might ruin your experience with it
00:42:02 Why didn't you fucking say so? I
00:42:05 It doesn't matter if it's a sequel to undertale or not the fact that the game itself sets this up
00:42:09 But it turns out it's just not an issue or it's like putting in QTE elements in a game that you can lose and you still win
00:42:17 That's what it is
00:42:19 Defense it worked and it did get me to play the game worried about like, you know stopping Susie from hurting people
00:42:29 Even though even though it turned out upon review that it was a trick and I did not actually have to worry about it at all
00:42:38 Can you quickly explain for the viewers?
00:42:41 Okay, me what happens when you try to do genocide run because I want to do that
00:42:45 I'll be happy to but I just did bug fixes for my game instead because I'm gay
00:42:48 I hear your brother. There was literally one difference doing a genocide run versus a pure 100% pacifist run and it is this
00:42:56 It is that at the end when all the characters when you're fighting the king at the end when you're like, oh, we can't kill this guy
00:43:03 What are we gonna do and then the enemies come and they like pick up the king and they take him away?
00:43:06 Like it you know friendship saves the day instead of that what you get is a scene at the end where
00:43:12 It's actually interesting
00:43:14 The what happens is instead of the king being carried away by enemies
00:43:17 What happens is Susie has over the course of the game has learned that pacify spell that Rawl say knows and
00:43:25 Casts that spell upon the king and he's really tired. So he gets pacified
00:43:30 That is the only difference. He learns it and doesn't just ask
00:43:34 I am 100% sure because I played it and that is what is stated by the characters. Yes
00:43:40 It's so for some reason the difference between these two is that I feel like she just remembered that Ralsei can cast it
00:43:47 So she asked him to cast it. Well, I have played the game and that is not what happened
00:43:52 So, I mean let me know how can you be 100% sure that you wait mage did you do this run?
00:43:58 I watched I watched
00:44:00 Dab dab dab dab. Yeah, that's what I thought. It's still it's still words Nate that I could read so, you know
00:44:07 Yeah, so you you're just saying that I'm wrong. I'll go check. I'll go fucking check right now
00:44:11 I'm just saying that we might be interpreting the same line in different ways, and I'm not sure which one is correct
00:44:16 I'm gonna prove it right now
00:44:18 Nate did this seem ambiguous to you at all. No, not at all
00:44:23 Changes there's actually two changes, but one is significantly smaller the second one. There's a secret boss
00:44:29 and
00:44:31 Yeah, and during the the pacifist route it turns into an armor, but it during the genocide run so to speak it turns into a
00:44:38 What then so the secret boss by the way is great and one of the best characters and
00:44:43 I just I want to say that you you you let you literally can't kill it like anything like you cannot kill anything
00:44:50 If you watch if you watch they do not die if you hurt them if you get them under zero HP
00:44:55 They like zip off screen like they're running away, right? But but can you what happens if you don't stop?
00:45:03 Susie from doing things just the same thing they just run away
00:45:05 They they get down to zero HP and and then they run away because that's what happens like mechanically that sucks
00:45:12 Okay, quickly. I just people are theorizing and I
00:45:16 Know what they're basing it off and it could be like completely wrong and I don't blame it
00:45:20 It's just an interesting theory
00:45:21 I just thought about is that darkers actually bleed and it could be because and the reason they run away is because
00:45:27 Toby Fox or whatever they're trying to hide the fact that they actually do bleed which is not common for monsters of
00:45:34 At least the lightings
00:45:36 What is that implying is that implying anything about?
00:45:40 Anything I
00:45:42 Don't know about it. It's just because at some point
00:45:46 Lancer Lancer. Yeah, Lancer brings up a bucket. It's like oh to mop up the blood that you're gonna
00:45:51 God, I can't wait for like a week now for Matt Pat to come in and explain all this for me
00:45:56 So I can understand it. Yeah, I did my due diligence. God damn it. I know everything there is to know
00:46:01 I just it's just I mean, I'm not saying it's true, but it's interesting theory
00:46:05 I mean, there might be a reason why you can I think it's pretty weak
00:46:09 I don't that seems pretty weak. It was a strange choice to have Kara literally break into the
00:46:14 Da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba Fortnite dance at the end of the game. That was an odd
00:46:19 Animation so I want to jump into something a little bit here that like my biggest hope for a final version of this game is that I
00:46:30 Recently have been on this kick where I'm talking about how media can basically broke it be broken into two categories
00:46:37 stuff that is about
00:46:40 Exploring the self and stuff. That's about exploring society
00:46:44 like
00:46:45 Every story is either about a man trying to come to grips with understanding himself well man or woman, obviously, but you know
00:46:52 I say man broadly or trying to come to grips a society around them and like
00:46:57 Informulate different opinions and different perspectives into one thing and when you look back at Undertale even though it has
00:47:04 It's about a
00:47:06 It's about one individual and how they slot into society
00:47:10 It's like are you someone who's a protector or a sociopath like where do you fit in but with this game?
00:47:18 Because you have a party of three and who knows how many more in the final game could be our teammates could be more
00:47:24 More to explore with this party system
00:47:27 It feels like this is almost
00:47:30 Spiritually a sequel which is why it's kind of weird even that this was like thought of before Undertale supposedly
00:47:37 You know, I don't I can't say I know the chronology of thoughts and Toby Fox's mind
00:47:43 But nonetheless at this game feels spiritually like a sequel to Undertale
00:47:49 Just in that there's three people in your party and that
00:47:52 Literally core to the mechanics is how those three people interact that like you can warn enemies about when this girl's gonna attack and the entire
00:48:01 Demo as soon as I knew that I was just like when is that other guy
00:48:07 rat res
00:48:08 I'll say I'll say when is Ralsei going to get mad at Susie. Yes for attacking and Toby's way too good a game designer to
00:48:16 Not do something interesting with Ralsei as a party member at some point
00:48:19 Yeah, like I knew that scene was coming because I was like well your character is not gonna do it
00:48:24 But like the fact that she's doing this is a problem. It has to be wrong brought up at some point
00:48:30 Ralsei's gonna get upset at her
00:48:32 He's gonna accost her for this the way she's been acting and like that's a very basic childish kind of
00:48:40 You know
00:48:41 black and white way of looking at it like either you spare him or you or you don't but
00:48:46 Surely there's more depth to it and the game then steps into the gray area of like what if there's an enemy you have to kill
00:48:53 You you don't actually you can just spare the fucking
00:48:57 final boss
00:48:59 All the way, but like obviously that's the next step forward, but then it's like well if this is all explored in chapter one
00:49:06 Surely there's even more you can do with this. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Will this game ever get made?
00:49:12 Okay, okay, so what since choices don't matter and you're forced into a pacifist route in the chapter one so far
00:49:19 Yeah, so far. Yeah. Yeah. What if you're forced into a genocide route in chapter two
00:49:24 Potentially that'll be fucking crazy. I mean, yeah, that'd be interesting. That'd be interesting
00:49:29 It seems like you know, it's setting it up because you know of the whole ending thing
00:49:33 I honestly have a lot of faith in toby as a character designer
00:49:37 So, you know, frankly, I'm I'm happy to sit back and say
00:49:40 You know, maybe I can't imagine all the ways to do interesting things with these mechanics
00:49:44 But I feel like there is enough material here to work with
00:49:47 That he can definitely come up with something and that thing again with like the moving heart at the end
00:49:51 Which is the physical manifestation of the theme that like your control can be wrestled from your choices don't matter
00:49:56 It's a video game. Ah, the only way to win is not to play. Ah, you could definitely
00:50:00 You know pull up pull a spec ops the line sort of thing with that or something the way and uh
00:50:06 My position basically I've been wanting to say this but I kept forgetting
00:50:09 Just I don't think toby fox can
00:50:12 Disappoint me. I'm at this point
00:50:14 It's just like because the reason I like undertone and I like delta rune is because it has the toby fox flare
00:50:19 It has his sort of like a quirky humor and just the little
00:50:24 Sort of things without in like for instance when I got jailed in in delta room and I ate the moss and I put the shackles on
00:50:30 And I'll say commented on it. I found it so funny. It was like you're like you could eat the moss
00:50:35 Yeah, you can eat the moss and then so I didn't know yeah, and the susie says like oh, you didn't even leave any for me
00:50:41 There's so much love and I love his artistic voice
00:50:44 So that's that is a lot agreed a hundred percent
00:50:47 So because it was it's a toby fox game
00:50:49 I don't think he can disappoint me to the extent where I would be
00:50:52 Upset about it. Even if it's the game is not as great as undertale. It was or you know mage
00:50:57 That's that makes a lot of sense
00:50:58 I I guess it's just fair to state that like some people have different hopes and expectations for what you know
00:51:04 This game may or may not be in terms of like mechanical complexity. I mean, I sure have some high hopes about that
00:51:09 I think a lot of people will enjoy delta rune for same reasons why they might have enjoyed undertale
00:51:15 And that is I wouldn't say surface level because that's an inherently derogatory sort of like
00:51:20 Oh, you're just enjoying it on the surface level
00:51:23 But I just mean the art the visuals and the sort of dialogue that you hear from the players
00:51:29 I think a lot of people will enjoy it
00:51:31 You're solely based on those aesthetics and the voice of toby as you said
00:51:36 Yeah, and I personally had absolutely no issue with it being an alternate universe because I like seeing the characters that I love
00:51:42 Living their happy little lives in but they aren't the characters you love. They're different. That's true. I know
00:51:47 I mean, they're wearing their skin
00:51:50 Well, it's called. Well, it's called. I mean, I called it an alternate universe for a reason
00:51:54 It's you're not the exact same characters, but there's like they look the same
00:51:58 But it's a different universe where they didn't have to go through the whole
00:52:03 Nonstance that they had to go through
00:52:05 So I still think it's interesting to see characters who look exactly like other characters that you've read and you know
00:52:11 Got to bond with except now they're different and sly and sometimes well
00:52:16 Luckily, that's a very small portion of the game that you don't need to worry about that much because the rest of the game is different
00:52:21 Don't don't confuse me
00:52:23 I with with other people here. I'm not saying I'm not saying that this is a large complaint from me
00:52:29 I don't even think it's really a huge complaint. I am more so on the camp that I just think it's weird
00:52:34 I don't really get where it's coming from. It's not
00:52:37 Odd curiosity that's that's that's where my beginning and end of that comes from
00:52:41 um, I think oh
00:52:44 sorry, I thought I was fucking mouthful, but
00:52:47 Get that dick out of your mouth digi
00:52:49 Take the words out of my mouth. I love dick
00:52:52 uh
00:52:54 The thing about it for me and the reason I've been so emphatic about
00:52:58 Why I wish he would have said something is that I don't mind that it's the same characters because
00:53:05 I feel like I totally get that as somebody who um, like mage said earlier has
00:53:10 Has a stable of character. So I've tried to put in a lot of different stories because
00:53:14 I look at it as that
00:53:17 generally with artists
00:53:19 Your characters all represent a part of your psyche
00:53:23 Like most of the characters that you write are bound to represent something about yourself some way that you think like
00:53:30 I tend to look at a cast of characters
00:53:32 It's like if you are a prism through which a beam of light is being cast then
00:53:38 You know all the characters are the different colors that are refracted through that prism
00:53:42 um
00:53:44 So like and generally when you look at an artist's work you can often say like oh this character
00:53:49 It's just an xb for that character, you know to use tv tropes terminology
00:53:54 um
00:53:55 So rather than create like major saying rather than create a character who everyone's just going to say
00:54:01 Oh, this is just the sands of this game. Just use sands again. He's the best representation of that part of your mind and like
00:54:08 Undertale is already a universe that allows for so much that he could
00:54:12 Like portray these characters as best. Maybe he imagines them
00:54:17 um
00:54:17 So like that part of it. I feel like it wouldn't have even been a
00:54:21 A fraction of a question in anyone's mind had he just said from the start
00:54:26 It's an alternate universe guys
00:54:28 Undertale doesn't matter and like I guess nobody would have said a damn thing. I I mean
00:54:33 I'm slightly with Nate here. I mean pretty Nate with I'm pretty with Nate here
00:54:37 I didn't really think like I just assumed it was an alternate timeline and that it wouldn't really like I
00:54:43 I could instantly tell this isn't a sequel in the sense that this is
00:54:48 I don't I wasn't expecting it was a sequel
00:54:50 It's just that it's clearly an alternate timeline
00:54:53 But without knowing distinctly because toby fox says in his tweet longer
00:54:58 Like don't worry about your ending to undertale
00:55:00 Everybody in undertale is fine and that's that's not affected by actually they're they're exactly as dead or alive as you left them
00:55:07 Right, right exactly exactly
00:55:09 So so like uh, they're they're fine either living their lives are dead and buried like you left them, you know, that's that's that's fine
00:55:16 but
00:55:17 Because I understood that they were alternate universes. My question was this okay. How is this connected?
00:55:23 But if I had read that tweet before I'm like, oh, it's not connected
00:55:26 They're just the same and that that changes how you think about them. Now again, this is a tiny complaint
00:55:32 I don't know why we're focusing so much not about it, but like that's my position
00:55:35 That's because it's it's weirdly fascinating because it's just the fact that look it's not even that like playing this game
00:55:42 I thought it's not that I thought it was a sequel or a prequel
00:55:45 It's not that I thought it would have relevance to the actual story of undertale
00:55:49 It's that when you see these characters it makes you think that the game will be like
00:55:55 Undertale that it will like like like ben said we spent the whole game waiting for the other shoe to drop
00:56:01 And if he came out and said it's not like undertale, you wouldn't have been waiting for that
00:56:06 You wouldn't have been thinking. Oh, it has to have it has to be meta. It has to be crazy
00:56:11 I mean that heart moving thing at the end is kind of that shoe dropping
00:56:15 If it is, I mean that could very well be but like he even says
00:56:20 In the tweet longer like I don't think I'll ever be able to make you feel that way again
00:56:24 And I don't know how much of that is him being humble or literal like it's impossible to know before we get full day
00:56:30 I was waiting for I was waiting for a moment like when flowery suddenly flowery's face changes and suddenly he's attacking you
00:56:36 And you realize that like you've been tricked. I mean I was waiting for that like
00:56:41 The whole game
00:56:42 Or something the notion of whatever like lack of control whatever you your choice don't matter
00:56:49 Sounds to me just like a bad game
00:56:51 But I just believe that's why I think I think he must
00:56:54 Subvert it like that's not a theme like that's not a theme that is like
00:56:59 A game where your choices don't impact the ending like let's explore that like what no, that's dumb
00:57:05 Like that's that's one of those uh jokes on you
00:57:08 I was just pretending to be retarded
00:57:12 The reason why I'm so fascinated with this relation to undertale and the fact he uses themed characters
00:57:17 Is because even though I now know after reading the tweet longer the somewhat the quality the chronology
00:57:23 Of you know, it was delta and then came undertale and you know delta was first
00:57:27 It feels on the surface of it and I'm really I'm crazy for this as a sort of you know marketing corporate thing
00:57:34 You know I'm making a new game, but undertale is really popular
00:57:38 Let me put in the old characters. So it'll spread the word around like hey
00:57:42 Stay today. Hey Steve. Did you hear that sands is back sands is back
00:57:47 I say dropping all of my groceries to run home pretty good for that though. The fact that literally was planned this way
00:57:52 I understand. Okay. That's what like again. Why why would you start talking if I'm still in the middle of my point?
00:57:57 Why why would you do that? I'm sorry? It's just that waking up in the bed that the last game ended in is just like
00:58:04 You didn't have the same bed though. I'm not even talking about that
00:58:07 I'm saying that it just is interesting the fact that this came first even though on the surface
00:58:12 I would think that it was a marketing thing and now the fact now that that has taken away from me
00:58:17 I am just confused at the point of him doing it like this now that we that it's revealed like oh, yeah
00:58:22 Like he's really into this. He just really likes having the same characters there
00:58:25 I know what you're all saying like oh, it's fun to see characters in a different life
00:58:28 But I just don't resonate with that whatsoever. I think it's extremely confusing
00:58:32 I'm saying the same thing as you like there's no reason it had to be this confusing like
00:58:37 Literally if it had started in any other way
00:58:41 Then that undertale ends with you being tucked in by toriel and
00:58:46 Delta rune opens with you being woken up by toriel if it opened in any other way
00:58:53 It would have been a thousand times less confusing
00:58:56 Chris which is a new name
00:58:58 Not even the one it is fucking totally irrelevant to the fact that it's like you could do
00:59:03 Anything else you could do anything else you could start off in a forest you can start off in a city
00:59:10 You can start off anywhere other than a bed being woken up by the character who tucked you in at the end of the last game
00:59:16 And it wouldn't have been as confusing. I get it. I think that it's pretty minor like because again
00:59:23 Frisk has a canon name and chris also has a canon name and they're not the same name
00:59:28 The fact that it ends
00:59:30 Okay, maybe this is just a way that that my mind works
00:59:34 But like if you're gonna do
00:59:36 Parallelism if you're going to do a juxtapit like if you're gonna do the same fucking scene
00:59:41 That the last game ended on as the start of your game. You're making a statement there. Are these intentional?
00:59:47 Or is this just the way toby fox writes his undertale games?
00:59:51 No, it's intentional. He definitely wanted you to be confused by the start of this game
00:59:57 That's why he put out don't anybody talk about it for the first 24 hours guys
01:00:01 Nobody spoil anything even though it's irrelevant to the original game. There is nothing to spoil in this fucking thing
01:00:08 That was another point I wanted to make it's very weird that on the main site of delt ruin
01:00:12 It says this is an experience for people who have finished undertale yet undertale has no but rare
01:00:17 Relevance to this story whatsoever. Well, I mean there is the asriel reveal. That's that's not even a reveal
01:00:26 It
01:00:27 This game has literally no
01:00:29 Well, if you have no connection to undertale then the fact that we recognize the face of that character like wouldn't make sense
01:00:36 It wouldn't first okay first of all we don't because we've never seen that sprite before we can kind of infer that it's probably asriel
01:00:43 I think
01:00:44 What having what having okay?
01:00:46 If this is an experience for people who have finished undertale
01:00:49 Then I think that what that must mean is that like if you finished undertale
01:00:53 You will surely recognize that ralse is an anagram of asriel
01:00:57 And you will probably guess that he is asriel before the end of the game
01:01:01 And then when he takes off the mask you'd be like, oh, yep. Mm-hmm
01:01:05 Um, even though that makes no sense based on the other things that the other characters say you will
01:01:10 That will probably I mean, that's it. That's like the only real connection to undertale that I can see
01:01:14 Okay, I have and even that is confused and I and I feel like I can't even speak any further on it because I clearly
01:01:20 Missing information do you think do you think the point of all this stuff?
01:01:24 Because now now that nade has told me you can move the heart at the end at the end of the game
01:01:29 Is all of this meant for the player?
01:01:31 Right like like I mean, of course it is but what I mean to say is that
01:01:36 Everything that's happening like the reveal of taking off as like, oh, it looks like asriel
01:01:40 That's for you everything that happening in universe like it's not addressed, right?
01:01:44 And then at the end of the game it's like, oh, you're just the heart the character
01:01:48 You're playing as isn't you in this world the world's just happening
01:01:52 And you're along for the ride and that's why all these weird things that like we understand as a player
01:01:58 Like oh, that's the character from the other game
01:02:00 And like this is a situation that explains something from the other game kind of but how it's connected like all of that
01:02:05 Is like on a different level than all the actual events in the game itself
01:02:09 That's a good point. They're there. I mean we we don't have all the information
01:02:12 There's definitely he is stated this game is for people who've played undertale
01:02:16 The fact that we recognize all these characters and that is that is a separate thing from the people in the game that
01:02:22 I mean, I'm just saying that could be intentional and could build to something
01:02:26 Um, I'm I'm still waiting. I'm still waiting for that shooter drop. I am I mean when when when you told us about the heart thing
01:02:33 We were kind of mind-blown, but I feel like
01:02:36 That's the kind of detail only an undertale superfan would notice. That's me, right?
01:02:42 Like you got to be somebody who is expecting
01:02:45 More out of every single second of the game, which yeah, how much fun is that to find and be the one you discover these things?
01:02:52 It is it is fantastic those things exist. But it also makes me think about the fact that in
01:03:00 Normally in art
01:03:02 When somebody makes something that is so personal that nobody else can understand it unless they dig as deep as they can
01:03:10 That's called autism
01:03:12 Like when you when when when someone makes a
01:03:16 35-minute analysis of why a sonic game story is actually super deep. Yeah, like we call that autism
01:03:22 And we laugh at it and we say it's bad storytelling and like if you do it. Well, it's fine. It's not bad
01:03:29 Or it's not it's just it's not I'm not even calling it bad. It's just like a matter of
01:03:33 We didn't see this heart move moment and it's so easy to play this game and not notice that and like
01:03:41 That's at the end of three fucking hours
01:03:44 You know like for I don't know I tend to look at art in a more like I I tend to measure it more in like time for
01:03:51 dollars kind of way like
01:03:54 if
01:03:55 If every moment of my experience is great
01:03:58 I give it a 10 out of 10 if
01:04:00 One moment was amazing enough to make up for a bunch of
01:04:05 Parts I didn't care that much about. Yeah, it might be a more fair trade
01:04:09 I'm just looking at this game and I'm like is is the fact that you can move the heart at the end and that like
01:04:14 Oh, there's confirmation. There is more going on. Is that enough to offset the feelings?
01:04:19 I had of three and a half hours of going
01:04:22 Eh
01:04:24 Nothing really going on in this game
01:04:26 It doesn't it doesn't greatly improve my like experience of chapter one. It just makes me more hopeful that
01:04:33 Because I have tons of hope for like this is a full game
01:04:37 I think like I have no real reason to doubt that toby could make a great game
01:04:42 But when I watched this chapter one, nothing grabbed me nothing grabbed me the way that undertale did
01:04:49 I feel a little grabbed by this heart reveal
01:04:52 Um, like by the end of the by the end of chapter one my expectations were pretty low like I
01:04:57 felt like I felt like maybe toby was setting up for like
01:05:01 Okay
01:05:02 So all of this is just to say that these undertale characters are not the same and this will not be an undertale ask experience
01:05:10 This will be a new and like this will be a new like totally linear
01:05:15 Totally YA level, uh, you know story about like a mew and a mean bully like going into an alice in wonderland world together
01:05:23 And we will have episodic adventures where that happens and you will fucking like it
01:05:28 Um, and I was and I and I was a little crestfallen by this
01:05:32 I didn't feel that cynical about it because just the fact that susie
01:05:37 Could attack enemies and you had to stop her like
01:05:41 Yeah, that's something that felt so that felt like a mechanic that you could do so much with
01:05:47 that like to think that
01:05:49 That the game that this chapter didn't do that much with it and like we know what toby can do. So it's like
01:05:55 There's no way he wouldn't explore this to a more full extent. Yes
01:06:00 I kind of got the impression from chapter one to made as episode two
01:06:04 Hey, oh my god, welcome. Welcome to episode two waifus now that we've done episode one episode two waifus
01:06:11 my new waifu susie from delta room
01:06:15 minus rules card
01:06:17 I love him. Oh, you know, I I I it took me a while to figure out that that you whose name you were saying mage
01:06:24 Just because the way I know I had such a hard time spelling it. Who is it? I don't even know what you're talking about
01:06:29 It's the it's the traps or the uh, the puzzle master
01:06:32 Yeah
01:06:35 He's cool. He's cool. Also, is he gassed out? Is he literally gaster? No, he's not gaster. It looks kind of like gaster
01:06:41 I'm just saying it does look kind of like all right. I got a hot take. I got a hot undertale take laid on me
01:06:47 I love delta rune because other characters are nice and cool and it's really cute and stuff
01:06:52 Yeah undertale. Here's my hot take. I think undertale strengths were all way always the characters
01:06:59 And and the story and and the meta gimmicks and and and like the the the world bending stuff was like
01:07:06 It's nice, but I don't care if it's not in this new game. I care, you know
01:07:11 hippo, I'm really glad you brought that perspective up because
01:07:15 um
01:07:16 That's the biggest disconnect that I think there is between two different camps of undertale fans. We're like
01:07:22 For me, it's like all I care about is the meta stuff and the characters did very little for me
01:07:28 Whereas I feel like the vast majority of people who like undertale mostly like it for the characters and
01:07:33 Like the meta was kind of secondary to them like most people like the game because they think that dating papyrus was a great
01:07:41 Yeah, yeah, I mean that I don't really care about that particularly. I'm not gay guys
01:07:48 But um like the the way that toby writes is is funny and quirky and nice and cute
01:07:54 And I like it and the characters that he writes are the characters that the sort of
01:07:58 Sort of characters that I like
01:08:00 And and I like stories and stuff and I've been burned by steven universe not existing
01:08:06 And I've blown through adventure time and that's over and I'm sad because though that's a good show
01:08:11 But there's no shows there's no shows that exist that are good and deltarune is like, oh, this is not this is like well written
01:08:17 Like like, you know cliche story a little bit of a cliche story like like oh
01:08:22 it's a
01:08:23 Something or other somebody changes their tune and it's you know
01:08:27 But like it works and it's effective and I just don't get enough of it nowadays
01:08:30 I just don't get enough of just good stories that are just told. Well, I like it
01:08:34 I'm on I'm on board with this. That's that's kind of where I wanted to go
01:08:38 I can't tell the difference between nowadays and before days because I'm constantly watching old shit. So
01:08:45 Oh, well, I I completely growthy hippo and a lot of my enjoyment from undertale was also the characters
01:08:51 I would say it's more about a 50-50 split maybe a little bit more of the meta because I'm a homestuck boy
01:08:56 But I did quite enjoy the characters and all of the quirky dialogue scenes and stuff such as that
01:09:00 I would say the only difference here is I don't really resonate with the characters from deltarune
01:09:04 And I don't really think that's an issue per se. I just find them not as interesting as you know
01:09:09 Sands and empires and stuff like that. I don't know if I'm really going to say that's the reason why I don't like it
01:09:15 We got we got uh, we got susie who's literally just nelson months
01:09:20 She's yep. She's good. I like susie. Yeah better than nelson. Well nelson doesn't particularly fleshed out
01:09:26 I mean susie at least has an arc. Nate. Okay. I don't think you remember. I don't think you remember
01:09:31 Nelson has a lot of fleshing out throughout this the the many seasons
01:09:35 Then I think maybe you give nelson credit. You know what that's fair. Is that the fucking the
01:09:41 You know, what's funny is the only name in my mind was Seinfeld
01:09:45 and
01:09:46 uh
01:09:47 I know it's simpsons now that you've said the ha ha noise
01:09:52 I'm drunk as shit by the way. Okay, that's cool. All right. Did you just wake up is
01:09:58 No, dude. I've been up forever. Oh sleep means nothing sleep is a whole other world to me
01:10:05 It's like a whole other different universe. Okay. Um, you know, when I read the comedy scenes in undertale
01:10:11 My impression is like, huh, that was clever
01:10:17 I like them a lot. I really like the writing. Yeah, I love toby's writing toby's writing is great
01:10:23 Toby's characters are great. It's it's all very intelligent
01:10:27 It's all smart and funny and I look at it and I think that sure is smart and funny
01:10:33 The the I think the funniest moment in uh
01:10:36 Undertale was the part where you are in like the glowing
01:10:41 Place with like the glowing water
01:10:43 Yeah, and you walk up you go like to like a little side path and you find the little bird
01:10:48 And the little bird like oh, yeah flies you across the tiny little gap with like the heroic music playing
01:10:54 Yeah, that was great. That was really good. That was really funny
01:10:58 The dialogue jokes and stuff are like I I guess it's that like homestuck's comedy is I mean, uh,
01:11:03 Fucking undertale's comedy is homestuck. Same thing. Yeah, that's what I meant to say, but like
01:11:09 Distilled like yeah, it's homestuck. Homestuck is explosive and constant all over the place
01:11:15 Like it covers every base imaginable and it's so long and it goes in so many directions and undertale is like
01:11:22 Drawing a through line through that
01:11:24 Undertale is is more pop than boogie and homestuck is more boogie than pop or whatever
01:11:28 That's a perfect description. I was gonna use the word normie, but you got me in an even better terminologies. Thank you
01:11:35 Well, I just want to say
01:11:37 That I definitely I don't know. I agree with munchie. I care about both
01:11:41 I the thing is I absolutely love all the writing and jokes. I like
01:11:46 A lot of people get turned off by like tumblr enus of undertale doesn't happen to me. I love everything about it
01:11:51 I don't even think it's as tumblr as people think it is. I agree
01:11:55 There is there is a little bit of like like bait for certain types of people
01:11:59 I mean, I still think it's weird that undine and alphys are kind of like I don't get the connection
01:12:03 But like whatever. I don't care. It's fine. It's fine. I mean, okay
01:12:06 I feel like tumblr
01:12:08 Poisoned the well in this case because like I've been into lesbians and like gay shit
01:12:13 Since way before tumblr because I too have like have had
01:12:19 Gender identity issues long before that was popular to have
01:12:24 Before it was like a codified thing where it was like, hey support me on patreon because I'm not sure if I'm a boy or a girl
01:12:30 Like yeah, like I had those issues before that was the thing. So like I feel like
01:12:37 Undertale speaks
01:12:38 I don't feel like toby is doing it to cash in on a trend or like he only he only writes lesbians into a story
01:12:44 Because he reads tumblr guys like no, I think he he has a better appreciation than that
01:12:50 But it's kind of just in that world. I do wish that it was less like a
01:12:55 fucking
01:12:56 Virgin gay boys idea of it. Like I I want some hard fucking
01:13:01 You know, it's not that kind of story. That's that's really all there is to every story should be that kind of story
01:13:08 I'm trying to say
01:13:09 Hey, fine final point. This is really my final point on this on this whole thing. It's that
01:13:15 unequivocally in my in my humble opinion the demo from
01:13:20 Undertale was way better. I do think that's true
01:13:24 Don't think that's debatable in in every way except visually because deltarune has some incredible visuals the sprite work is off the charts
01:13:30 I absolutely my favorite sprite work is when the main character points in battle and there's little sparkles when he's commanding
01:13:37 It is gorgeous. It is gorgeous and I love the battle aesthetic is really nice
01:13:41 Yeah, it's great and I love that it's it's in world battle arenas. You don't final fancy teleport to another one
01:13:46 It's just it's chrono trigger rules
01:13:49 fantastic sublime
01:13:51 Is that true? I didn't pick up on that. Yeah. Yeah, you watching someone play the game. No, that might only be in some areas
01:13:57 It's only in some areas of very normal enemies. You just transport to a computer
01:14:02 Synthwave, but for bosses you go in
01:14:06 In the world. I hope it does more of that. Hope it does more of that stuff. Um, uh, but uh, uh,
01:14:11 Right, I just I want more meta stuff
01:14:13 I believe in toby my faith is restored and I just I need him to deliver some but I believe that he will that's
01:14:20 I think this could I mean I think that this game can be amazing. I don't know whether you probably talked about this
01:14:26 Well, but um
01:14:28 Sorry, there's a lot of lag happening. Um
01:14:31 The speaking of like faith restore and toby. I am just happy like regardless of like the quality of this this deltarune
01:14:38 I'm happy that I know what he's doing and then he's doing something me too
01:14:41 We were we were talking in the chat the other day and devoo say that we're all a bunch of assholes when this came out
01:14:47 But that's fine. Uh, we were just saying how man like what the fuck's toby up to can't wait for him to milk undertale forever
01:14:53 And never do anything and then this drops out of the fucking blue
01:14:58 Blowing me the fuck out my blowing my asshole wide open like a blooming onion from outback steakhouse
01:15:04 and I just want to say that
01:15:07 I have been deeply inspired by
01:15:11 Toby's commitment to his artistic vision with this shit and the fact that he's a one-man team
01:15:17 He's got temi on sprite work. He's been he's sucking japanese cock all day. He loves his japshit
01:15:23 With the translation and I don't know. He just seems really into it. Also. He's learning japanese. He's a hero
01:15:28 He's a hero this guy. Did you know about the fact that he interviewed zune?
01:15:33 What I had no fucking idea. He interviewed somebody linked it to us in uh, I am games
01:15:38 Yeah, he like met zune who was like who found out about undertale because people are like
01:15:42 This is like toho and they sent it to him and like he did an interview with him and like
01:15:46 Apparently he's like a huge fanboy of perfect cherry blossom
01:15:49 Yeah, yeah, those two together is such a perfect like those two fucking indie heroes basically
01:15:56 Yeah, I just maybe i'm exaggerating a little bit to call toby hero, but i'm reading his twit longer
01:16:01 He's definitely indy. Well, the only reason I say that when he was making undertale
01:16:05 He was definitely an underdog hero now. He's like he's successful, right? I'm sure he could ride
01:16:10 Indy hero. He is soon as fucking successful
01:16:14 I mean that's true
01:16:15 I'm just saying like like I was gonna say that like the fact that toby is like guys. I want to make this project
01:16:20 I have a vision. I don't know if it's even possible to make my vision
01:16:24 That is an inspiring thought and he's like i'm going to try
01:16:27 I'm gonna try to make a team to make it happen and i'm just like fuck. Yes
01:16:32 This is what I this man should be doing
01:16:35 This is what everybody should be doing. Yeah, if you can afford it, which he can thank god
01:16:39 More so than the game itself like that twit longer spoke to me a lot and like it made me
01:16:45 Even though I didn't it didn't make me love the game more, but it made me empathize with him more
01:16:51 as like when he said when he like the ball drops and he's like look
01:16:55 Like when I made the undertale demo was to prove to myself
01:16:57 I could do this game in a short amount of time
01:17:01 This demo took me years to make and like
01:17:04 He's straight up like some of it is because of the fact that it's aesthetically way more
01:17:09 It's got a lot. It's a lot more complex
01:17:10 And he had to set everything for the future in this if he ends up more
01:17:14 So he had to plan a lot. Yeah, but he also mentions like loss of enthusiasm in the project
01:17:20 Like at some point it's like hey, this is taking too fucking long. I'm he probably has had better ideas
01:17:28 He's probably just through sheer force of aging looked at this and said like I'm getting less and less interested as I go and like
01:17:36 He set a definitive amount of time of how long he's willing to work on a project
01:17:41 Seven years seven years is the maximum and he's like and consider three of those years are already up
01:17:47 You know, imagine seven years making a game and then you decide. Well, no, it's a bust. That's I'm calling it here
01:17:54 Yeah, someone's really done. I don't believe it
01:17:57 I mean Duke Nuke forever took 12 years to make
01:18:00 It started and stopped many times though. I mean for different companies and shit, but but like I just think of of tobi like
01:18:08 Like if he builds this team and he makes the game that will be great
01:18:12 If he doesn't I'll be equally excited that like it failed and he moved on to the next thing
01:18:18 Like it's kind of weird
01:18:21 When he was working like when I first found out that this was like Undertale 2
01:18:25 I was disappointed because I was like I would rather tobi be doing something else
01:18:29 Like this this man has shown us so much talent in undertale
01:18:33 Why would he chain himself to the same characters in the same world?
01:18:37 but then like
01:18:38 When he explained that it's not
01:18:41 Undertale 2 that he wrote this so long ago. I was like, okay, I get it. This guy isn't
01:18:46 He's not boundlessly creative. He's a man with a with a very specific something
01:18:52 He has to get off his chest. I feel more like you know, like it wasn't that undertale was
01:18:58 Born from him being somebody who's like, I'm gonna play with the meta of games and that's my career
01:19:03 It's more like he had something specific to say with these characters and they they represent something to him
01:19:09 to an extent that he would use them again, but
01:19:12 Like and then to hear him say like
01:19:15 Yeah, this idea in spite of being maybe less complex than the other idea
01:19:21 To like thematically is more complex in terms of design and therefore it will take longer and is harder to do
01:19:28 Yeah, it's it's uh, it's fascinating
01:19:32 I I just want to mention uh homestuck took seven years to be finished. So I think that's where he got that number from
01:19:38 Ha, maybe that is wait. Did it take only seven years? Yep
01:19:42 It felt like a lifetime
01:19:45 Act six was what four of those years wait, it took me it took me seven years just to read it
01:19:50 Wait, homestuck started in 20
01:19:52 2011 right no nine
01:19:55 Oh, okay, okay, that makes more sense. I was confused. I was like, what the fuck how could it have ended last year?
01:20:01 Hey, by the way, uh, just small point. I went and I read we were arguing about like the genocide ending how it ends
01:20:07 Uh, uh, me and mage and uh, I did look it up. I did look it up and what it says is uh, uh that
01:20:14 Like so susie does something the king falls asleep and then, uh, uh ralze walks over
01:20:21 They say that i'm surprised you remembered my pacify spell
01:20:26 So maybe she like told her to use it or something either way you got used maybe susie didn't literally learn it
01:20:31 Yeah, because it was it happened off-screen and we didn't see who used it and that's that's true. That's true. Yeah
01:20:36 Okay, so fair enough a small point, but I just yeah, yeah, yeah, it's good to have a resolution
01:20:41 Some sort of resolution. I'm sure they appreciate that
01:20:44 I mean, uh, yeah, I mean that pretty much sums it up for me guys. Uh, anybody have any other comments?
01:20:51 Hey, how about that how about that ending song with uh with the lady singing?
01:20:56 Oh, I hate it. It was it was reminding me that like a huge part of why I have so much respect for undertale and
01:21:03 Also deltardune is that the music is so fucking. Yeah, it was awesome
01:21:09 Like no matter what I could say about story mechanics, whatever it doesn't matter toby fox is an amazing fucking musician
01:21:16 That nobody can take that from him ever that battle thing
01:21:19 Nate
01:21:20 We were talking about two different things the smash thing. Oh, yeah, you smash the yeah, yeah
01:21:25 I was I was talking about the smash. I was talking about that. I wasn't talking about the the deltardune Indian song
01:21:31 That's what i'm saying like that. I didn't like the deltardune ending song. I don't like it. It's weird
01:21:35 Like fantasy. I want chip tunes. I want chip tunes toby. I don't want these fucking human voices in my goddamn undertale
01:21:43 Give me what I want. Give me what I want toby
01:21:46 It made sense to parallel to the original game because that was the like it had live guitars in the ending and everything
01:21:51 That's true. That's true. Yeah, he was doing a thing there. He just wanted that extra little punch
01:21:57 Oh, that's some kingdom hearts shit. I think he got um, I kind of love kingdom hearts
01:22:03 Speaking of kingdom hearts, that's the answer. Ralsei is just azrael's nobody
01:22:08 Yeah, Ralsei's azrael's nobody that's that's
01:22:11 Oh my god
01:22:13 Oh my god, light and dark light and dark
01:22:17 Just for fun. Uh, did you guys know so I I played everything I did everything, uh, you know pacifist and and aggressor whatever if you fight
01:22:25 Um, uh, the the secret boss the the devil which I love and is hilarious
01:22:30 Um, if you fight him and you defeat him with pacifism whatever something it doesn't matter
01:22:34 But when you defeat him with attacking and aggression
01:22:37 He tells you that the knight, you know, like the the boss that started the well and is like doing stuff
01:22:42 There's there's a mention of the knight is the one who's like doing shit
01:22:45 Actually in in that boss when you genocide fight this guy. He actually mentioned there's a queen who's coming back
01:22:51 So just so you know, there's a yas queen that the knight is actually acting on behalf of who seems like they're probably gonna be the real
01:22:58 Villain, so
01:23:02 Yep, yas queen. It's gonna be hillary. Can't wait. Can't wait seven years from now
01:23:09 Okay, you can't you can't die tom. You're not yet not until delta room
01:23:13 I heard actually I was on a thread and on v and someone's like, uh hate life want to die
01:23:18 No good video games, uh delta room comes out says it's going to be seven years till the game's like god damn it
01:23:23 I want it to die toby. Why won't you let me die?
01:23:28 Pretty good
01:23:29 All right. Well, I mean that's so wait is is this like a single topic episode or can we talk about smash direct?
01:23:34 Well, oh, let's we have only we have only talked about delta room, but we are not
01:23:39 Legally bound to it. If you want to talk about the smash direct. I say, let's do it. I'm shocked. It's shocked. Oh, right
01:23:47 I'm sitting was it to not have a new adventure mode. I understand that making the subsystem is
01:23:52 Substitutes a mysterious locker. I said it was the equivalent to make an entirely separate game
01:23:56 That was half of brawl development. I understand that it was a big idea, you know
01:24:01 And we're taking a lot of work to make all those fmv's
01:24:04 Uh, but
01:24:05 In male a's adventure mode was good enough male a's adventure mode was you were walking around in a world
01:24:11 You know first episode or sorry the first level
01:24:14 It's like you're playing a mario game and you can play a chic or you can play a zelder
01:24:17 You can play whoever and it was good enough. You just would go through these nintendo worlds
01:24:21 It was way shorter than brawls and it was could have been easily doable by the what?
01:24:26 900 billion people they have working on this fucking video game
01:24:30 So there is something though. I mean there literally is a kind of mode with world of light. Do you know that it's not that?
01:24:38 Well, I don't think we really know right now. Okay. Okay. I have seen no footage of a level in the sense of
01:24:46 Not a fight, but you know you were progressing from one side of the screen to the other and there are obstacles in the way
01:24:51 I have seen exactly zero of that in any of the trailers
01:24:55 And what it seems to be is that there's a giant world map and you interact with this world map
01:25:00 The world map is you know
01:25:02 Painted and it looks nice and there's all these different video game elements in it
01:25:06 However, you are merely playing a mini game walk around the map press some buttons on this over world
01:25:13 And then the actual gameplay is sometimes you will come across a person who you have to defeat in a
01:25:19 Combat scenario, so I have seen no evidence that it is like Maly's is just a sort of weird
01:25:27 Yeah, it's like a weird
01:25:29 Maybe almost mario party-esque like the fights of minigames and moving around on a board
01:25:34 I would describe it like that
01:25:36 Well, but the only thing is maybe there are still cool like there is at least that intro
01:25:41 Story thing where all the characters get blasted by light and I'd like to point out
01:25:45 Not every character was in that trailer. Does that imply that there's characters elsewhere who are not dead?
01:25:52 I mean like cloud wasn't in that where's cloud. I don't know
01:25:56 Yeah, the thing is there like a story that's gonna happen with him elsewhere. I don't know with the with the smash direct
01:26:02 There's there's like
01:26:04 Oh, I like smash. I I'm interested to see what's what's coming up
01:26:08 And then like the direct was just like a really terrible presentation like you can get annoyed about the presentation of that direct
01:26:15 And I did and I was yeah, well, what do you mean?
01:26:18 What I know about the game. Oh shit, right? What I what I know about the game is that there may be
01:26:24 Something resembling some sort of subspace emissary-esque thing with some amount of cutscenes
01:26:30 I don't know enough about it yet to actually like that
01:26:33 But that's all I wanted from a new smash game is a is a is cutscenes where the characters interact with each other
01:26:39 And and and they look at each other and it's like, uh, they're running
01:26:43 They're running that they're together
01:26:45 Samus and Pikachu you know stuff like that. It was so cool. We got a little of it at the beginning that cut that movie
01:26:50 We got we got that big. I mean, they've done so many promotional cutscenes that I
01:26:54 I really hope it's not all just for promotional reasons. That's what it was with the last game. So
01:26:59 You know
01:27:00 Where's gino guys? Where's gino? Why isn't he in the game cracks just sips monster energy drink?
01:27:07 Where's gino?
01:27:08 I'm about to say something more that will definitely make a few of you in the chat angry
01:27:13 And I'm definitely not saying that smash should not exist in the form that it has and there are a
01:27:20 Remiss any of the decisions that had led to this point
01:27:23 However, there is a small part of me that thinks
01:27:27 Some of the worst things about
01:27:31 Smash on a gameplay level is the fact that it's a crossover series
01:27:35 This is not to say that I don't cherish again the subspace emissary
01:27:39 Again to see these characters who you love interact in various different ways with people from other franchises
01:27:44 However, I will just say that as a
01:27:48 fighting game person as a person who enjoys the gameplay of smash
01:27:54 I I start talking and everyone starts booing in the audience who all hate super smash brothers. Yeah. Yeah, okay
01:27:59 I get I know I know it's not fighting games a part of the game
01:28:01 But someone who does I would say it's always very weird to me when people are like, yes
01:28:07 More players like more characters. Yes. We just need gino
01:28:11 But there's no one actually saying like hey, let's have like a new like, you know, let's have a new brawler type character
01:28:19 Let's have a new, uh, you know actually talking about their gameplay mechanics
01:28:23 I'm just talking about how it's a cool character that you like from other games
01:28:27 I'm so with you because like
01:28:29 Where do you fucking stock?
01:28:31 Where do you fucking stop the buck on that shit? Never you never stop it. That's the deal
01:28:36 There's like 45 fucking characters in smash. Like there are 74 characters confirmed 75
01:28:43 Fucking that's the most in any fighting game ever
01:28:48 Like you know, it'd be even better 75 75 would be even better with the plant. So, uh, you know beyond that like
01:28:55 Literally and you know what? It's great. Not only five is a new high
01:28:59 You could go on forever. Like there is no character. He can introduce that will satisfy me over the character
01:29:07 I wanted to be in like yeah, it's impossible for everybody. It's like
01:29:12 Fucking piranha plant really it's like
01:29:15 Well, what did you want asshole and then you get 35 different answers goku, you know, we gotta put them all in
01:29:23 Yeah, the Grinch
01:29:25 I've never been like interested in in the characters that come out
01:29:29 It's it's really just like it's the same with deltarune
01:29:31 Like I don't really like playing the game smash that much
01:29:34 I just remember the subspace adversary being a crossover and I love crossovers and I love characters and I love character interactions
01:29:41 I love those cutscenes for all those reasons because they they made
01:29:44 Like they made the idea of playing with these these, you know toys
01:29:49 3d digital toys
01:29:51 Like controlling them and having them like be real
01:29:55 Like that was the aspect of of smash that I always liked playing it
01:29:58 It's hard and I'm bad at it and I suck and I don't like it and
01:30:02 and you know, it's
01:30:05 Like all the characters in the world could be in it
01:30:07 I just
01:30:09 I don't care. I love I just quickly wanted to check the reason I'm being quiet is because I never played those games
01:30:14 Never gonna play those games completely not interested. That's why I'm fascinating. So
01:30:18 It's such a rare opinion
01:30:20 Yeah, I've literally never heard that opinion before I've heard even tom who
01:30:25 abjectly
01:30:26 Doesn't like smash, but I've never heard no interest and never played smash
01:30:32 Well, there I am here. I go. It is a nintendo thing to me the degree of which I just care about more characters realized
01:30:39 In the smash bros universe, you know, whatever. I want my gino guys, you know reuse cool incinero or whatever all these new
01:30:46 When will you accept that gino is a
01:30:49 Super fucking obscure character and I accept that
01:30:53 I also accept the fact that sakurai has specifically said that he'd like to put him in in the past
01:30:58 And he's also fairly popular in north american polls. So, you know, these are
01:31:03 What is sakurai's relevance
01:31:05 He's makes the game. Yeah, what makes which game super smash bros god did what
01:31:12 What?
01:31:13 That's the man. I thought sakurai was the final fantasy guy. No, that is. No, it's tatsuya. Nomura a.k.a.
01:31:20 Sakaguchi, I think it was sakaguchi. Sakaguchi, that's something. Okay. Well, that's the relevance. He is the man making the game
01:31:25 Go man, that's that's gonna. I'm sorry. Nate. That's gonna be a major. Go man. Now. Say I'm
01:31:35 It's spreading like like everyone fucking played like everyone with a super nintendo played mario rpg
01:31:41 Everybody fucking love. Look, I'm not true. What are you talking about?
01:31:45 Let's not pretend that gino is like someone that we that everyone is clamoring for across the world
01:31:51 I I get it. I have played mario rpg and not even made it far enough to see gino
01:31:57 I I bet I I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if more people alive today meaning millennials and no one else
01:32:05 Played mario rpg then played. I don't know
01:32:08 Castlevania one or two. What maybe that was playing today, right?
01:32:13 Uh, yeah, I don't know. That's a big oof for me there, ben, but uh, you think so you don't think so
01:32:18 I'm gonna look at the sales of each right now. Uh, I would like to point out as a smash boy
01:32:24 That smash bros was not originally smash bros
01:32:28 It was dragon king the fighting game
01:32:31 And it was a game made specifically just for the mechanics
01:32:35 Because it was iwata and sakura being like, hey man fighting games are all the exact same fighting games are the same
01:32:41 Let's make a new fighting game. That's different. And so they made smash and it's a beautiful game with beautiful mechanics
01:32:47 Where it's not just fighting, but you know health bar goes down
01:32:50 It's you know, you're racking up damage and hit them off the screen with the beautiful airtight controls
01:32:54 And it was incredible and they're like, hey, uh, no one's gonna like this game. How do we market it?
01:32:58 Uh, just fucking put mario in there, bro. Haha. Yes
01:33:03 Number one most successful game ever except for poke. I'm saying
01:33:06 I'm not saying that I hate smash or anything. I love smash. It's one of my favorite games
01:33:11 She's of all time
01:33:12 I love playing as kirby because I am kirby and i'm not upset like just want to make sure
01:33:18 Like guys don't vote me out of the office. I just think it would be cool if the smash genre wasn't relegated just do smash
01:33:26 And yeah, I know about rivals of aether. Yeah, okay. I know about rivals of aether. I know the other ones
01:33:31 But okay tbh who gives a shit fucking roll owned
01:33:37 Do you like that kirby is canonically confirmed to be the most powerful, uh, uh person in the game?
01:33:42 He's just like the only survivor from the no, he's just he's just the first
01:33:46 Yeah, I mean he was riding a war star. I guess I'm so on it. I'm about to slam myself here, dude
01:33:51 Because fucking apparently according to vg charts with the z dot com
01:33:57 Uh
01:33:58 Super mario rpg sold 2.14 million games and the highest selling castlevania symphony in the night is 1.27 million
01:34:11 That's fucking crazy castlevania seems so beloved and talked about
01:34:16 I certainly love it. All right. That well it is. I'm just uh
01:34:20 Mario rpg is talked about and beloved and and uh and not to mention it's part of the mario franchise
01:34:26 Which is just a huge advantage. I have not even seen one analysis video about super mario rpg. It's coming. There are best game ever
01:34:33 Super mario rpg legend of seven stars will be here one day. Wait for it. I did a g rpg on that. Oh, yeah
01:34:38 No, it will. Oh wait, that's right. That's right. Hippo did two g rpg on it
01:34:43 Well, that's I've seen so many about like mario and luigi and shit and mario is great. It's good
01:34:50 Uh, that yeah, uh, all right. I have a question. I have a I have a thought piece
01:34:55 Um
01:34:57 Would you prefer if you could only have one or the other would you prefer gino to be in smash?
01:35:03 Or for gino to come back for another game installment in the super mario rpg franchise
01:35:07 That involves weighing my my faith in nintendo as a development company to make another good j rpg
01:35:14 And I do not have that faith. So I mean look at cloud like. Oh my god guys
01:35:18 We're getting a final fantasy seven reboot. Uh, I would much rather just have them in smash and just like have the cloud
01:35:24 I remember and respect as opposed to the bastardization that we'll be in the remake. So, you know, that's pretty much how I
01:35:30 That's that's true. I'm just saying if that implies that like a direct sequel in the vein of mario rpg would come out
01:35:37 I would acquit like yeah. Yes. No, don't interrupt the perfect ending of mario rpg. It's perfect as it is
01:35:43 Well, nate. I mean like the mario games all take place in the same continuity
01:35:49 and like so like having a sequel to it would not ruin it any more than
01:35:54 I don't know fucking
01:35:56 Fucking any of the other ones. You know, they're all they're all mario games. There's there's what like 30 years of baggage now
01:36:01 Let's let's you already have a fucking mind's blowing. You heard those in numbers. I said before, right? Yeah, uh
01:36:08 What do you think is the best-selling mario rpg?
01:36:13 mario and luigi bowser's inside story. That's my guess
01:36:16 You are correct bowser
01:36:19 Bowser's inside story with 3.77 million
01:36:23 Jillian guys
01:36:24 Bowser's not sorry. It's a good fucking game. Literally stop hating for no reason
01:36:29 Saga being 2.1 and super mario. Okay. Well super paper mario for the we is the highest selling of the paper mario with 3.37
01:36:38 Actually, that might even top bowser. That's not unfortunate. That's a good game before look. It's good
01:36:42 But it's not as good as the other mario. I would say it's equal. It's just different
01:36:46 Okay, it should have said it should have stayed a spin-off. It shouldn't have decided the course of things
01:36:51 I'm gonna need a guide for mario and luigi and super paper mario because like everyone's opinions is vastly
01:36:57 Oh, oh, did you all get with the real shit? That's not fucking fake. Oh the only the only good mario luigi game is the first one
01:37:04 Yeah, all right. Yeah, correct. Yeah, accurate statement. Well, the first three are all great
01:37:09 The first three are all classic games
01:37:11 You should play the first three and then literally everything after that is a dumpster fire and terrible do not agree on that
01:37:19 The first and and similarly very similarly paper mario the first three are all great
01:37:24 Here's the difference between the paper mario games paper mario 64 is like a cozy experience when you play with the lights off
01:37:29 And you're in bed. It's a pretty slow experience
01:37:32 But it's kind of quirky in the same way that dealt to ruin. Oh callback is
01:37:36 paper mario 2
01:37:39 Paper mario 2 is sort of like a more action-packed version of paper mario 1
01:37:43 It's got which looks way better. It looks beautiful
01:37:45 There's a ton of interesting gameplay mechanics
01:37:48 And you play if you want to have a good video game experience and the worlds are also super interesting
01:37:52 Super paper mario is a great game as well with a bunch of it's not it's not an rpg in the same way that the other two are
01:37:58 It's like an action rpg where you move around the world
01:38:01 But it's got a really interesting aesthetic a great story and it just is a generally good spin-off video game that you should play as well
01:38:07 Paper mario super paper jam is a terrible game and it sucks. It makes absolutely no sense
01:38:13 Paper jam
01:38:14 Yeah, or what's it called sticker sticker star sticker stars the first one. I like paper jam paper jam is a thing
01:38:21 It's like mar it was a mar a paper mario 3 printer error. No, no, that's actually a thing. Uh, it's uh, mario and luigi paper jam
01:38:28 It's not paper jam
01:38:30 Wait, oh, do you guys know what is the best selling game with all time?
01:38:34 It's a bad game isn't it? Yeah mickey mouse steamboat will it's like a new game right? It's like it's like a new game
01:38:42 It's we we sports all right because there was one for we or something
01:38:47 8.2 million
01:38:49 We would like to know 82. I meant to say 82.6
01:38:53 82 okay. Hey going back to munchies point. I just want to say about about the smash thing
01:38:58 Uh, I am somebody who would sacrifice
01:39:02 Any degree of like balance or any of that fighting game bullshit just to get one new character
01:39:09 Because I don't give a shit about I just want characters. That's all I care about
01:39:13 Look, I'll I'll adapt man. Whatever. Whatever. It's fine. I don't care
01:39:18 The meta's gonna be what it's gonna be. Yeah, I'll just adapt. Why would they not add susie to smash?
01:39:23 Why?
01:39:24 Why this there was this the cryptic 24 hour thing and it was gonna coincide the smash
01:39:29 Oh, oh susie is gonna be in smash because delta rune's new and it's like a promotional thing. Oh, it's it's confirmed
01:39:35 I want it. I want it. What if he really he releases the delta rune chapter one and it's just a like side story
01:39:42 Explaining how sands found a poor magic portal that transported into smash
01:39:47 How is there nobody from golden sun?
01:39:52 That he's been confirmed as an assist trophy isaac tragically. He's uh, Nate. I mean, I know you like golden sun
01:39:59 But you are literally the only person I know who has ever played golden sun. I played golden sun one and two
01:40:05 Golden sun was my first video game at not literally but my first rpg is the first game I cared about
01:40:12 Okay, it's it's actually a fascinating story. Uh, because because here's the thing about golden sun
01:40:17 It is fairly well known and reasonably liked. Here's what I think the reason is why like I was a deeply beloved
01:40:23 I would say it's by by some that's true. Um, and it pulls all right in the polls
01:40:27 But like I think the reason why Isaac is not a care is not a playable character is because
01:40:33 Camelot the developer
01:40:35 It's it's because the series like they just like if they put Isaac in that alone
01:40:40 I think would catapult the series to get another game made and finish off the like the the sequel to dark dawn that I think they
01:40:47 Wanted I think camelot has given up. That's what I think and because they've given up
01:40:52 They don't want to put in the energy like if if we're gonna put a character in why put it in for like a dead series that
01:40:57 You know, we could do it for fucking piranha plant or you know, whatever it is. Oh, yeah, the new piranha plant game
01:41:02 I can't wait. I can't wait for the new piranha. I don't even that doesn't even sound weird
01:41:06 That doesn't even sound like a weird thing that would surprise me if it were true
01:41:09 Yeah, like these companies have to decide what they're gonna do
01:41:12 It's some kind of some kind of motion controlled thing where you like use the game pad to like tilt around and like stretch your
01:41:19 Fucking vine. Why would you ever expect?
01:41:22 Gino to make it in before chrono, I'll tell you why uh, oh before chrono you were saying, um
01:41:29 Well, one is literally mario character. I think that goes a long way
01:41:33 Yeah, but he was in one game. That's not that well technically speaking. He's been in two games
01:41:40 Oh, jesus christ has a little mario and luigi. He shows up. Yeah
01:41:45 But but okay, gino. Okay, gino has already been confirmed to be in
01:41:50 The new smash game as a little like player icon now
01:41:54 I'm not I don't know what that implies
01:41:55 But they obviously have the ability the legal right to use his likeness in the game to a degree
01:42:01 And I mean some people think that's a deconformation that like he isn't in but we saw like an image in the trailer
01:42:07 I don't think it implies that at all. I think uh, it things remain the same
01:42:11 He's likelihood as being a dlc is certainly possible
01:42:14 But I'm not even trying like I don't want to convince anyone that gino should be in the game
01:42:18 I just happened to think that he would you would you classify smash brothers as a religion?
01:42:23 Imagine a new mario rpg right imagine that in we we meet uh, we meet like gino, but not gino
01:42:31 As we know we meet the we meet the person
01:42:34 We meet like the person who is like an in-world superhero or something
01:42:38 Okay, like an in-world like captain quirk kind of character like, um
01:42:42 Who the who the doll was based off of and he's like a hero to the he's like a hero to the people and the hero to the children
01:42:48 But he's oh my god
01:42:49 You mean we meet the original gino who is not the same and he's more of like and he's more of like a corporate sellout
01:42:55 But then for whatever reason the star spirit has to come back to like continue
01:43:00 You know he has to repair the star road again
01:43:03 And he comes back takes over a doll again
01:43:05 And like the real gino ends up in league with whatever force broke the star road and the doll has like has to overcome
01:43:12 Okay, like original gino can't be a real person. Well, I guess it is mario. I was going to say puppets aren't alive, but
01:43:19 Wait what because gino could like canonically gino is a puppet
01:43:24 Like the mario is an inanimate
01:43:25 He's an inanimate puppet and the the the little toadette playing with him
01:43:29 Seems to think that he's some kind of superhero. Yeah, but that doesn't mean he's based on one
01:43:35 No, well, it doesn't mean that but he could be while we've been talking
01:43:38 I've been trying to like research the most popular characters in nintendo games from like the last
01:43:44 Uh 20 years
01:43:46 It's actually shocking how well represented like all the most popular characters even if the third party are in smash
01:43:54 To the extent that gino actually would be like one of the top five candidates probably those characters who would make sense
01:44:02 Um, what do you mean? How so how do you figure like just that most of the characters from like, okay?
01:44:08 I'm going by like game FAQs looking at like the most popular games that are looked at on there and
01:44:14 almost everything on nintendo consoles is represented like down to like bayonetta and
01:44:19 Shit, that's like not even first party
01:44:22 Um, but I do think it would make just as much sense for like golden sun or
01:44:27 Gino or something like that to be the next one
01:44:30 to come out there was something else
01:44:32 That I saw that would have also made sense
01:44:35 like, uh
01:44:36 It's it's really just a shame that rareware is like microsoft now because like banjo would obviously make sense
01:44:43 They should make a deal just make a deal dog like with cloud fucking figure it out pay the money
01:44:47 I don't know yeah like banjo or some resident evil characters like leon from re4 would make sense
01:44:53 Yeah, sure because re4 was a huge game cube game game before it became can we please get fucking
01:44:59 I forgot the name of the silent hill two main character. Can we get that guy, please?
01:45:04 Can we please get jill sandwich as a smash trophy?
01:45:08 We should we should we should get mara from shimakami tense eight
01:45:12 It really sucks that rare when with microsoft now they can't use donkey kong games because of donkey kong 64
01:45:17 Really sucks that they left donkey kong reds
01:45:20 Yeah, he's right. He's right. So you're implying that why don't they just use banjo and also but even more
01:45:27 I'm honestly shocked that like they have any
01:45:31 Square eighties characters and not so am I dude. I was blown the fuck away
01:45:35 I made a video about it like three years ago
01:45:37 Not having like if if you ask me like if they were going to do another square character after
01:45:43 After cloud like before gino. They will do chrono
01:45:46 I would have to disagree. But who knows maybe that you could be right. It could be right
01:45:51 I think one of the most popular characters of all time just because chrono trigger is so beloved
01:45:56 This this this is mara from shimakami tensey by the way. He was he was joking
01:46:02 Are there any shimakami tense it came on?
01:46:05 Oh, that's a dick monster. Oh the dick the dick chariot rider. Yeah
01:46:11 You're right. I do want him in there that would be that would be great. Which game is he from shimakami tensey
01:46:17 Just the first one. Yeah, just any game. I'm pretty sure he's in a bunch of them. He's in a bunch of them
01:46:21 Okay, beautiful. All right guys. This conversation is going down the tubes real fast. I feel it. I think we all feel it
01:46:28 Let's uh, look the only thing I have to say about the only thing I have to say about super smash brothers
01:46:33 Is that the latest the latest trailer that has like uh sonic running away and then reaching out to hold
01:46:38 The good grab pq and then they both get like teleported away
01:46:42 Uh, that's getting dangerly close to canonical sonatru and i'm uncomfortable about it
01:46:49 He's right. He's right
01:46:51 If only they had fused they could have had the power to escape, but they didn't do it in time
01:46:55 That trailer was that that that that that animation was great. I love seeing everybody try their best to survive and
01:47:01 Instantly die and can I just say okay? Here's the thing. I love most about uh smash bros and it also extends to like
01:47:08 Decidio final fantasy like games like that like that that's the zelda in
01:47:13 Smash bros the new smash bros is the character design of the one from a link between worlds
01:47:18 Which was like a tiny little like chibi sprite and it's been brought to life
01:47:23 So beautifully and to see that character design in these incredibly beautiful animations brings so much joy to my heart
01:47:30 And uh, and I wanted gino to be one of them. God damn it. He deserves respect
01:47:36 But now it's just gonna be a fucking dlc character. You know, I was like malo better
01:47:40 I'm zelda from uh smash bros, you know the new one. Okay. Yeah

01:49:03 I actually sucked at it a lot with with with uh with the controllers
01:49:07 So I had to learn this definitely looks like a vita game like a vita port
01:49:12 Yeah, sadly, I didn't know that um, but I I only bought it because it was on sale on on steam
01:49:17 So and there we go and I'm having fun with it. It gives me
01:49:21 It gives me a little bit of bit of persona vibes. It's not as good, but I don't know. It's fun. It's fun enough
01:49:27 All right, we got to move through this fucking thing faster. Let's so let's let's get through these fucking games we're playing
01:49:32 Here's my list. I'm playing ease eight on switch a little bit. I'm playing hyper light drifter on switch a little bit

01:49:42 I'm playing a little bit of eventical the porn game from steam and I'm playing a little bit
01:49:48 How can you be playing a little bit of devil may cry one?
01:49:50 We we did a live stream of that last night where tom beat it in one three hours sitting
01:49:55 Okay, well, I've played I don't know maybe twice for like two hours settings. I'm not that good at it
01:49:59 So, you know, whatever take me a while last game. I'm playing believe it or not

01:50:24 Oh, also, I forgot delta rune now. Good. What do you play?
01:50:28 Uh, I have been playing a lot of team fortress two and I've been getting getting into a big old like depression about it
01:50:36 About how I'm not good at the headshots and I keep missing my head shoots and I keep getting dominated by the entire other team
01:50:43 They're gangbanging me. They're getting me all in the shooting holes
01:50:47 Through my body. There's no body left. I'm dead and I keep coming back and I keep rage quitting every time I die
01:50:52 And I keep immediately opening tf2 after I rage quit and I just do it over and over again
01:50:57 I think to myself. What am I doing? Why am I doing? What am I? What am I trying to accomplish here?
01:51:01 Am I trying to get better or am I trying to what's going on here?
01:51:06 And then I go to youtube.com
01:51:08 Slash german 985 and I watch all of his old videos
01:51:12 Then I go to star underscore and I watch all of his old videos
01:51:14 And then I watch how it feels to play scout in tf2
01:51:17 And then I fucking I look at a million tf2 videos every day and I don't do anything
01:51:22 And I'm fucking sad and it sucks. It was the best game of all time
01:51:26 I love it when I can get a hail screw skill streak with my sniper rifle
01:51:31 Oh, I love tf2. Fuck you tf2. You shit
01:51:34 Idiot
01:51:34 Hey, but you know what the worst moment my entire life was was a few days ago

01:51:40 Show kathy some of my culture and so I turned on german is mad and she didn't get it
01:51:45 No, I know I know I was so fucking devastated. I couldn't believe that I that I thought it drops out
01:51:52 Yeah, that that that was investing time and the person who didn't understand the appeal of german is mad
01:51:58 What the fuck I've never seen german is mad german is mad is the only video on the planet worth watching
01:52:05 If you're watching another video, then you don't understand
01:52:09 German German and star videos are like the game grumps before game grumps, and they're still better than game grumps have ever been ever
01:52:16 sick
01:52:17 Bad, what are you playing well?
01:52:19 um plan uh
01:52:21 Me and munchie playing endless war. I'm pretty pretty tired today because and this is my chance to segue into what I actually care about
01:52:30 We had the uh, we had rfck con yesterday. It was great. We met up with some some top some top killers and top rowdies
01:52:37 My my achilles tendons are are raw and frayed to the point of nearly snapping
01:52:43 Because I was walking around in boots that were not the most comfortable
01:52:47 um
01:52:49 And we met uh, we met endless war in real life and that's what happened to the base of endless war
01:52:52 It was a great as a grand gay old time
01:52:55 Well, uh, we prayed we prayed for his mercy and we did not receive it. I gotta ask at the the pillow fight
01:53:01 Well, what was that room? Where were you? Was that a big old hotel? Oh, ben wasn't there?
01:53:05 That was like that was like an after party thing wait pillow fight. It was like an after party thing
01:53:10 I I because paradox rocks had flew in and he flew in like towards the end of rfck con
01:53:15 I wanted to spend more time with him because he is my literal adoptive son
01:53:19 We just went back to efrim's hotel room and me efrim a.j.
01:53:23 Shoop cough kazi and paradox rocks. All he just hung the fuck out ordered pizza and uh shot the shit
01:53:31 And uh, I beat the shit out of paradox rocks once. I don't think that that was recorded
01:53:35 It wasn't on my channel
01:53:36 Then paradox rocks beat the shit out of efrim and then I think efrim beat the shit out of someone else
01:53:41 But I forget hey, oh efrim beat the shit out of a television
01:53:43 Man, this is too fucking meta for me. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Munchy, what games have you been playing?
01:53:51 We're talking about a
01:53:52 Convent I'm sorry. I'm sorry that you don't understand literally everything that we're talking about
01:53:58 Yeah, that's well, that's it. I guess
01:54:01 Munchy, what a game are you fucking playing? I I don't play video games. I only play pokemon going in this war

01:54:31 What happened to crosscode?
01:54:33 Getting it on the beginning of crosscode. It's not as valuable as making a video about tails
01:54:39 So that means you just wasted all that time playing crosscode, you know, it wasn't a waste because I had a great time
01:54:47 Why we're gonna we're gonna disappoint the iam games. We've been talking up that crosscode video
01:54:52 Nobody said that I quit crosscode just because I made him fucking decided to play tails of fantasia

01:55:02 It's gonna take us what like longer than uh fucking delta rune will take the finish because there's so fucking many of them
01:55:08 Why are you playing tails of fantasia instead of tails of berseria with that very sexual main character velvet?

01:56:17 Yeah, it was fucked up what you did to your character
01:56:24 Now I remember why it was sounded familiar. Okay. Yeah, yes tails of symphony was my favorite game of all time
01:56:30 And I was 14 and I wrote a lot of pornography about the characters
01:56:34 What's uh, what's the name of the sexy ninja girl?
01:56:37 Sheena
01:56:37 Sheena yes, she was the biggest titty girl in the world. Well actually tifa was in my pornography
01:56:44 the lolly girl uh
01:56:46 And uh while sheena was asleep
01:56:49 inserted the hilt of us a short sword into her own pussy
01:56:54 And then put the sheath of said sword and now we're demonetized
01:57:00 In her sleep. Wow
01:57:03 That was one of one of eight chapters of which I got of which on fanfiction.net before they killed all pornographic fan fiction
01:57:11 I had 8 000 views which until the my little pony channel was the most views I ever caught on anything
01:57:19 I ever did on the internet. Do you ever see I've seen a couple of like 14
01:57:23 I've seen I saw one girl's twitter bio once that was like, uh, it was like 10 000 views on youtube
01:57:29 like, uh, something like 20 000, uh, like snapchat or twitter followers like
01:57:34 100 000 snapchat followers and then like 10 million views on porn hub and it was like an escalating
01:57:41 Legit that fucking tale of symphony of pornography that I wrote when I was 14 took me almost
01:57:48 10 no 10 minutes
01:57:51 Eight years to come in view count it took eight years of non-stop production of further internet content
01:57:58 What can you say it appeals to the largest demographic pornography? That's you know, yeah, and I guess tells everybody a fan's
01:58:05 Porn is for everybody. If you are a viewer and you would like to escape the frankly uncomfortable and confusing lifestyle
01:58:13 of listening to the pcp
01:58:15 And calling yourself a pcp fan like full stop in there then please go to

01:59:02 Okay, like what did you call me? What did you call me at halloween? You call me like a like a zoomer like a zoomer pied piper
01:59:14 Damn that's so true and much is the lead zoomer. Yeah
01:59:19 He's the first one caught in my in my piccolo song
01:59:22 Damn, that's good. That's good shit. Yeah
01:59:25 I'm very proud. Um, I guess we're all kind of that. You know, I was just actually I got an interesting message from somebody
01:59:30 Um in my in my patron discord
01:59:32 I was like rounded up the you know the the people who haven't paid their taxes need to be killed
01:59:37 You know who unpatroned and one guy it was it was really fine. He's just like hey, dude
01:59:41 Just letting you know, uh, you know, just whatever don't want a patron anymore
01:59:44 um
01:59:45 And one of the things he said was that like like I've I've since outgrown the need for your message of like self betterment
01:59:51 And taken responsibility. So like I don't really need your perfect now
01:59:55 I get that every day like every time someone unpatriots me. That's what the message is. I mean, that's fine
02:00:00 But I was just like wow, that's actually kind of great. It's a little sad. But like they won't pay me
02:00:05 No, it's it's it's such a weird feeling. I see the temptation, but I think like that's dumb actually
02:00:11 I mean, maybe he's just lying and actually he just you know, doesn't know what
02:00:15 I feel like those people I feel like those people think that they forget about the fact that you
02:00:20 Remain older than them and that your message will evolve
02:00:24 Well, I mean like yeah, that's true continually need your guidance unless they are actually exceeding you unless you have
02:00:30 Unless they like they've taken like a huge
02:00:33 Attitudinal shift in their life or something. They no longer see they probably think they're a badass and they're gonna quickly realize
02:00:38 They're not maybe they are I believe this guy or at least that he believes it
02:00:42 It's just that like I mean I think about myself like nobody's that cool
02:00:45 I was nobody's that
02:00:48 If if somebody like I don't know is loving loves my content
02:00:51 But then like gets a great job like gets a girlfriend and is just like loving their life
02:00:56 Like I totally get why like you need to take responsibility or whatever. They're like I did that's good. You know got it covered fam
02:01:05 Sure, you know that just sounds like what I want people to do and and I've been thinking about how like
02:01:09 It's inevitable that at the very least people will probably age out or like just some people are gonna not care
02:01:15 About anime video, whatever and just go to other stuff. But then probably like new kids will cycle in
02:01:20 It's almost like you're a teacher in a classroom of a certain grade level
02:01:24 Whatever that may be and people cycle in and they cycle out is their life
02:01:28 Constantly realizing that you're aging because the kids keep getting younger and younger somehow while you only get older
02:01:35 Yeah
02:01:37 I don't know. It's just interesting
02:01:39 This sounds terrifying. Let's talk about something else. Okay, you know what we can go to those we can go to the voicemails anytime people
02:01:45 I want to quickly I want to quickly make a shout out. It's just
02:01:49 Not for myself not for myself. It's not not something that will benefit me in the long run
02:01:53 Is just so there's this anime that absolutely no one is talking about on the internet
02:01:57 It's just like it doesn't exist. I swear like three or four people and like it's called double dicker
02:02:03 So I just want to raise awareness about this anime because I give us the elevator pitch. Why is it good mage?
02:02:08 What's more like double dicker?
02:02:11 Yeah, why is it good mage sell us please have you guys seen tiger and bunny?
02:02:18 Yes, I have no I'm not certain but it seems like it's by the same people
02:02:22 He has that sort of aesthetic and style to it and like the characters are really fun
02:02:27 It is by sunrise who did this who did both but yeah
02:02:31 In fact, it is apparently tied into tiger and bunny. It is a
02:02:36 Oh, okay. I like it even more now
02:02:39 Okay, well, hopefully so much. Let us know
02:02:41 Press press m in the chat if you don't listen to mage and did that
02:02:45 Yeah, you don't have to like it
02:02:47 I just want people to be aware that it exists because no one's talking about it
02:02:52 I say I'm if you approve of mage press m and chat
02:02:56 Mage, I've got an idea. Why don't you make a literal anime analysis video on why it's so great to raise awareness?
02:03:02 Like I did with oh shit. They galco chant. I'm really not good at those things though. It's not hard enough
02:03:07 It's not hard. It's right. I I go search double deck your dug and krill and I see what it looks like
02:03:14 Is it a good mage? Do you like it?
02:03:16 I mean, it looks like ass, but if she says it's good, it might pass. I mean, it's a cg nightmare, so
02:03:24 I mean, I mean the tiger and bunny had also cg'd and so, you know
02:03:28 The city's state of wifillania
02:03:30 Two suns arise above the city and the people here live
02:03:33 Oh, yeah, it is in a city that is named literally this town is called lis valetta
02:03:40 Oh, which sounds like lithuania. No, I did not realize that
02:03:44 Oh
02:03:45 I see I see the fucking propaganda. Oh my god. There's government like
02:03:49 Mage has been hired by the government to push this propaganda
02:03:53 Is the main character a young a young girl dressed in complete purple with a baseball bat walking around the desolate streets
02:03:59 It is actually a young man described exactly that way
02:04:04 He does not have a bat. He does not have a bat
02:04:07 Is he actually purple?
02:04:10 The pieces are falling into place
02:04:13 His whole entire design is all purple, but like head to toe. Well, we know we know why mage is watching the show now
02:04:21 You're not entirely wrong
02:04:25 I got into it
02:04:26 I mean, I it was recommended to me by by biter and and he sold me because there was a main guy who was purple and he
02:04:31 Was cute. Oh, but bet his personality is so adorable. He's just so excited to be there. It's just how can you not love him?
02:04:37 That's always endearing. I like people who are excited to be anywhere
02:04:40 He's a bit of a dumbass, but I love him double decker. Check it out sponsored by mage and and state of lithuania

02:07:26 I do recall having like things of in the similar vein of like it's food, right for children, right?
02:07:37 They're tiny little crackers and bits of cheese the thing is I never liked cheese so I would never eat
02:07:41 Well, okay
02:07:43 The lunchables that are good are the pepperoni pizza ones and it's because for me as a child
02:07:48 They were too expensive for my mom to buy them for me. But as an adult. They are like
02:07:54 Digi's over here in the lap of luxury with
02:07:59 Mountains of tiny pepperoni
02:08:01 They're like 250 they're like not even expensive. That's fine. You know, I relate did she I relate like back in the day
02:08:08 I couldn't get like cereal or like kinder egg surprise is too expensive. So now I'm just
02:08:14 As soon as I became an adult I was drowning in cereal
02:08:17 Best thing about being an adult. Yes
02:08:19 Did you have only I've only ever had the cheese pizza lunchables because when I was a child my mom was like the meat
02:08:25 And these are disgusting and you're not allowed to have
02:08:27 Because my mom she's wrong
02:08:30 Okay, well the thing about the lunchables pizzas is that the key to them is that they come with
02:08:34 It's three pizzas and you get nine pepperonis and the satisfaction of laying out your three pepperonis per pizza
02:08:41 And then like take like each pizza you can it's like perfectly proportioned to devour in three bites
02:08:48 So you have one bite per pepperoni. It is the most satisfying fucking meal in the world
02:08:53 You need to put like a video on the main channel if you analyze really do
02:08:57 Dude, I did I I made a uh, there's not on the main channel
02:09:02 But on after dark there's a video of me eating nine lunchables pizzas and I got the worst of a cake of my life
02:09:09 Do not eat more than one box of those. I know it's tempting because you're like, haha, I'm an adult
02:09:15 It's only five bucks. I can do whatever I want if you eat more than four lunchables pizzas. You will feel like shit
02:09:21 I'm just letting you know because all of it is just sugar every single element of it tastes like sugar
02:09:27 The the the end of that message was I think asking us like if there's any other like crazy election people in our areas that like have a
02:09:34 Kooky thing. Oh my god, that was a question. Don't you know about donald trump?
02:09:40 I mean, there's always a crazy guy. I remember like the last time in the in the
02:09:44 uk election for prime minister or whatever that there was a guy running
02:09:50 And he was like what I think he was wearing a giant elmo suit or something
02:09:55 And he was just elmer and nobody took it seriously
02:09:58 But he got votes because people hate politicians and it's funny to vote for that guy
02:10:01 Oh, okay. So there he was kind of like a goofing on the whole system. Yeah, there's there's there's usually a goofer or two
02:10:07 There's a guy with a giant boot on his head. I think I've seen an image. Oh, yeah, I've seen the guy
02:10:13 Are you having a vermin supreme?
02:10:15 Politicians, yeah, maybe got him
02:10:19 Right. Oh, Ben. What were you saying? I I know I've heard of vermin supreme
02:10:23 I have a I have a a delta rune
02:10:26 observation to make
02:10:28 To jump back. How did that happen? Did anyone know this is a this is a question slash observation
02:10:32 I want to know if anyone else feels the same way about this. I have a feeling I'll be the only one that thinks this
02:10:37 Uh, was anyone else annoyed by the dear girl having a crush on susan. Why do you hate lesbians so much?
02:10:43 Tell me explain it's not that I hate lesbians, Nate. Although I do but that's not the reason why I felt like it had no
02:10:50 It had no relevance to the game that was like it was just oh by the way he he
02:10:55 Ship them. Yeah, it was it was irrelevant, but I mean there's more chapters to come. So whatever maybe it will be
02:11:03 I know it's not because I want susie susie's mind and no one can have you know
02:11:08 My reaction my reaction to hearing that like to the learning that uh, what's her name?
02:11:13 The dear girl has a crush on susie is wow
02:11:16 This dear girl is a fucking idiot and probably a terrible person
02:11:20 Because susie is a freak and a monster who I don't who like bullies people
02:11:25 Shubs them into lockers and threatens to bite their face off
02:11:28 If you like someone if you like someone like that, you're probably
02:11:31 Okay, first of all, you're probably fucking stupid says ben
02:11:37 Ben first of all, I don't think anyone has actually seen susie bully someone because if you talk to everyone all she did
02:11:43 Throw a ball and then they hated her. It seems like everyone's scared of her
02:11:49 When she comes in the class they also say they no one actually seen her bully anyone
02:11:52 They're just scared of her because she's big wait. Do they wait. Do they say that do they say
02:11:57 There's an implication throughout the classroom that that that she
02:12:01 Tries to put on a front and then they can sort of see that she's not but they are still scared of her because they're just kids
02:12:07 I I think it's pretty evident that like regardless of whether she's done that or not like yet
02:12:14 She's a 14 year old to 16 year old girl. Of course if she's attracted to other girls
02:12:19 What would she more be more attracted to than the bad boy?
02:12:22 You know the the bad one the the bad apple the one who seems like a bad ass
02:12:27 I mean susie's like that sexy rebel kid from the breakfast club, you know, exactly. Yeah, uh, but she's obviously she likes her
02:12:34 But like she's mean and she's nasty. I think she acts terribly
02:12:37 I think if it weren't for the fact that undertale already did the lesbian thing
02:12:41 You'd be like this doesn't feel as forced as it does here
02:12:45 No, I don't think it feels forced. In fact, I think it feels totally natural
02:12:49 I think it feels like something that would definitely happen in real life
02:12:52 But it also makes me mad. Well, it makes me mad and I don't think it's fair and I thought I just think it's
02:12:58 I read girls and I was like Ben's such a Ben's a nice guy. Why won't you date him girls? Why?
02:13:04 It's just no, I no no no
02:13:05 I read that I read her being like oh
02:13:07 I have such a crush on Susie and I just put and I just put the game down and I'm like
02:13:11 I know I know of course you do but she's awful. She's awful
02:13:15 Ben do you think it's implied that it is healthy of her to have that
02:13:20 affection towards Susie
02:13:21 I don't think the I don't think the game really makes much judgment either way. It's implied to be innocent enough
02:13:28 Yeah, I mean, I think it's totally natural that she'd have that
02:13:31 Like I don't think Susie has displayed herself as like an abject sociopath. I think she's
02:13:38 She does she fucking she fucking shoves you into a locker and tells you she's gonna bite your face off
02:13:43 You know that not the kids in class
02:13:46 Also, I mean these people probably grew up in the town together. Don't you think it's possible
02:13:50 There was a time in in you know back in antiquity where Susie and this person were kids and they may be played together
02:13:56 And they she has some positive memories based on that so even if she's being a jerk now
02:14:00 Maybe there's a connection that's fan fiction. Hey, you just wrote fan fiction. Yeah, I got it consider it
02:14:06 The dear girl. She's like naive and innocent and and soft and kind
02:14:10 So she might admire the strengths that Susie has that she laughs true true
02:14:16 I just yeah, we're all writing some good fan fiction right now. It's just you know, okay
02:14:20 This is not this is not a story problem. This is not a the writing sucks problem
02:14:25 This is a this is a this is a the world is terrible problem where it makes
02:14:30 It makes sense and is totally fine and acceptable that someone that acts like Susie could have like, you know
02:14:35 The affection and admiration of strangers for it
02:14:39 People literally make fan pages for serial killers in real life. I don't that's true. Well, there you go. All right
02:14:46 I mean, I get your right Ben proving proving that but people like are attracted to weird shit and sometimes just strength and
02:14:53 Yeah, I don't you know, I want to I want to say on the basis of this conversation
02:14:58 Before I never talk about Delta Rune again. Yeah, Delta Rune is perfectly fine
02:15:05 I want to go on record as saying that anything negative I have to say about the game
02:15:09 There's nothing wrong with it. I'm just old
02:15:16 I don't I don't I have legitimate semi criticisms like this whole thing about how all my efforts to protect enemies from Susie
02:15:22 We're literally pointless. Let me let me take that back
02:15:25 It's not that there's nothing wrong with it potentially at all. Just that like it's it's overall good
02:15:30 I'm just I don't I don't care. Something being good doesn't impress me
02:15:35 Like I need things to be great for me to give a fuck because I've seen countless good things
02:15:41 Like I've seen hundreds of thousands of good things
02:15:45 So something being good is not impressive to me, but like I do think it's good. I'm not saying it's bad in any way
02:15:50 It's fine. I get that. I
02:15:52 I get the attitude that like sure it's good, but who cares
02:15:56 Because undertale for me is not impressive. I don't care about the good things
02:16:00 I don't care if Delta Rune does something totally different from undertale
02:16:03 It's just that undertale changed the game and awakened me a little bit more to like amazing things you can do
02:16:09 And like I just want something like that to happen in delhi. It doesn't matter. What can we move on?
02:16:14 Yeah, we should continue. We should continue. All right. Let's move on. Please. I want this to end
02:16:19 I I hear you. Okay. This one's from pcp fan
02:16:23 Unconditional love guy. That's yeah, okay. That's terrible real name. That's me. That's my
02:16:29 My cock is right here. I'm really happy to hear you guys on a Saturday morning at 3 a.m
02:16:34 I'm sorry. It was late. I just wanted to mention that there's now as many ptp episodes as there are
02:16:40 Is the greatest anime of all time dragon ball super?
02:16:44 I just wanted to know you could be any dragon ball character. Who would you be?
02:16:49 We got several messages about which dragon ball character we would like to be
02:16:54 I would be uh
02:16:56 Puar the shape-shifting cat. Oh, yeah, I would obviously be Goku because he's the best one
02:17:01 I was gonna say you'd be popo because you look like popo. I don't even know who that is. I've never watched Dragon Ball Z
02:17:07 Um
02:17:09 Munchy the very slightly minorities definitely like completely mr. Popo
02:17:13 It's not a race thing. It's the fact that he's a stocky boy with like big impressive girth and that's what munchy is
02:17:19 Why not boo? Why not Majin boo who's big and pink because he's too fat. He's too fat to be munchy
02:17:23 You're too fat to be munchy. Get the fuck out of here. I'd be sell because I'm into eugenics
02:17:29 So, you know, yeah
02:17:31 I'd be when I was a kid and we and dragon ball z was super popular and every kid was claiming
02:17:36 A person. I was android 18. So I guess for nostalgia's sake. I feel like ben's frieza ben just seems like
02:17:45 Cool, cool, I'll take it. I love it actually
02:17:49 I'm actually sincerely complimented that I was frieza and not I don't know that one pig. Oh, uh, whatever. Yeah
02:17:56 We're long
02:17:58 If I can I know I changed I changed my mind. I'm gonna be oh, I forgot his name
02:18:03 The the general blue
02:18:05 General blue. Oh, that's the blonde, right? The nazi guy. The funny the funny gay nazi is really cool
02:18:11 Magic mage by the way, I can totally see why you'd be android 18. That's the blonde one, right? Yeah
02:18:16 I'm reflecting on it and I get it. Normally. I would pick like some cute girl
02:18:21 I want to be right but like chi chi or something in dbc
02:18:25 There is no who thinks chi chi when they think cute
02:18:28 Like as a okay as a child she's an extremely sexualized little girl. So that sounds like something did you think though like
02:18:35 There's no
02:18:36 dbz girl who I really relate to
02:18:39 What about vedel vedel's pretty good as for the well, that's what I'm thinking is like
02:18:44 You can either be one of the girls or one of the like the guys who's with the girls and like ultimately if I had to pick
02:18:50 It's like well vedel is the cutest I'd be gohan so I could be with vedel
02:18:54 That doesn't feel that different from my actual life. No wait, who wants to be gohan?
02:18:59 Yeah, sure. He gets he's with vedel who's fine
02:19:01 That's the square. What okay the hottest girls are like android 18 and vedel probably
02:19:08 Yeah, that sounds about right. Oh, I don't we'll launch I guess from dragon balls
02:19:12 Launch is pretty good. Launch is good too. I mean the thing is that all I don't think the girls in dragon balls year that hot
02:19:19 Okay, what it comes down to is that the characters and dbz are all very basic
02:19:23 Like every guy is just like a male ideal and every girl is just like your ideal girlfriend
02:19:29 So it doesn't matter who you choose no matter what you get the perfect life like any dbz character you pick
02:19:34 You just live perfect. I don't really like a curatoriyama's girl
02:19:39 Or fucking tm. I like bulma. Bulma's looks nice. She's cute. Yeah, like everybody loves bulma. And if you
02:19:45 Bulma is pretty badly
02:19:47 Okay, who do you want to be do you want to be bulma so you can be a hot girl or vegeta so you could fuck a hot girl
02:19:53 It doesn't matter all the characters are the same. I just like bulma. She she stole my husband
02:19:58 I uh, I want
02:20:01 Oh, I want to I want to be android 17 because uh, uh, he's a not he's the closest thing to a machine man
02:20:08 That oh, yeah
02:20:10 He has unlimited energy and he's in super and he looks the same age
02:20:14 So maybe he's immortal. So I'm on is he the one with the red mohawk. No, that's no that's 16
02:20:20 16
02:20:23 Guys guys did pan ever grow up like because the last time I saw her was like she was in gt. Yeah
02:20:29 She wasn't gt. Yeah, jesse is telling us in the chat
02:20:32 You guys are looking at this all wrong the correct answer is krillin because he's the only one but the actual normal good life
02:20:38 It's true. I don't I don't like being krillin and getting to fuck android 18 is pretty fucking perfect
02:20:46 Um, like I mean, okay if I'm thinking of it in terms of like
02:20:50 Like when I think of it broadly, I just think that being krillin is no different from being gohan
02:20:56 Like if you're getting more specific krillin is krillin is like the best human in the entire series
02:21:02 Jesse's pointing out that nobody hates krillin
02:21:04 But I feel some people aren't too fond of gohan after what like he after gohan gave up like all his incredible power
02:21:11 Like I said, like I think we're thinking of this broadly
02:21:13 But if you're gonna get ultra specific like like I said all the girls are kind of the same all the guys are kind of the same
02:21:19 So it's really just like
02:21:21 If on a broad level like if you want to get specific
02:21:24 I just don't really think about tbc
02:21:26 And I don't know it well enough krillin or gohan the way that I respect someone like like goku or vege
02:21:32 Yeah, you know
02:21:33 It was like the least respectable guy at dbc for for in a way like he's he's a dead
02:21:38 He's fucking dead. Vegeta then. Vegeta. Vegeta is the best. Goku is awful. Goku is objectively a character
02:21:45 I don't like as I've grown older and uh, it makes me very upset
02:21:51 If anyone can explain to me what goku did to like not not that he deserves more power
02:21:56 But literally what technique did he use to acquire more power than vegeta who objectively tried the hardest genetic
02:22:03 genetic genetics
02:22:05 Which doesn't make sense. He just he just is strong and it's really gay and I hated it forever
02:22:10 Well, that's that's kind of what I love about dbc is that like the main character is like the least
02:22:16 Not okay. I won't say the least interesting character, but like among the central cast. He's like the least relatable
02:22:22 And uh, I think that's almost appropriate like if someone's going to be fucking god
02:22:27 Like the guy who solves every problem. You're not that fucking guy
02:22:32 No audience member is the guy
02:22:34 The moment in the kid boo saga when vegeta finally is he's like sitting there beaten and bloody on the ground like already
02:22:40 Basically dead but somehow came back and goku's like super saying three fighting majin boo
02:22:45 And he just has to come to terms with the fact that like yeah, you're better than me and it just always will be that way
02:22:49 Man that fucking hit me hard as a kid
02:22:54 Like like I think goku is there to remind us like we are not goku
02:22:59 That's why vegeta is the best character in dragon ball like not even a contest like the realist dude the best guy
02:23:07 Yeah, vegeta is the best character in in dragon ball z vegeta is the new main character when he you know comes in
02:23:14 But if you read dragon ball goku is interesting and I like I believe you I believe you
02:23:19 He's fun in dragon ball krillin krillin is the vegeta of dragon ball
02:23:23 Okay, this is my theory on why why goku sucks in dragon ball z because goku is the main character of a comedy series
02:23:28 And dragon ball z is not a comedy series
02:23:30 We'll share and also he never mentally grew up even like a little bit. He never kissed his wife. How did he have children?
02:23:36 Oh my god. I mean you don't have to kiss a woman to impregnate her. I'm just saying I'm just saying who says goku never kissed
02:23:42 Chee-Chee goku did in dragon ball super
02:23:45 There you go. Wait, what? Yeah, I don't wait. What? Yeah, he doesn't even know what a kiss is
02:23:50 But what about all that pornography? I read. All right guys, let's we've been a way too long in this question
02:23:56 Let's move on to the next one shall we? No, I'm fucking I'm fucking
02:24:05 Regardless of why their bed gives a fuck about dragon ball z he grew up with this show and to hear this is obviously
02:24:12 Fucking deeply disturbing
02:24:15 This is like wait, there's something wrong here
02:24:20 Something's rotten. I guess they're
02:24:22 Corrupting his character by you know
02:24:26 It is kind of ridiculous because he was like that in dragon ball like he's like chee-Chee like asked him to marry her
02:24:32 And he said yeah for that real reason and he never kissed his wife
02:24:36 What and it was implied that he he had no idea what he was getting himself into when he said he was married
02:24:42 Why didn't she say something like
02:24:45 How you know goku how you're supposed to talk to that. It's impossible. She couldn't just demand
02:24:51 Why would you marry it kiss her like what the fuck like she has her fucking
02:24:56 She's kind of got like
02:24:58 I don't know. It's a weird relationship where like sometimes she's in control and but most of the time she's totally not
02:25:03 What if she didn't while he was asleep? What if that was the only way it was safe because he's so strong
02:25:07 You know, yeah, maybe he doesn't remember kissing her
02:25:10 Do you guys ever read that it was like an article called like like how to fuck superman or like like something about like
02:25:17 It was a it was like a think piece about how lois lane has sex with superman
02:25:21 And it's about how like his sperm or so would be if his sperm is like proportionally strong as the rest of him
02:25:26 They would like shoot through her body and like rip her eggs to shreds literally happened in the movie hand cock
02:25:32 Have any of you seen it or heard about it? Yeah, I've watched it. I don't remember how it dealt with this
02:25:36 Yeah, will smith comes through the like roof of the trailer that they're fucking in
02:25:41 Like he has to pull out so that he doesn't fucking murder her with his god damn. I don't remember that
02:25:46 Yeah, there's a scene where they're fucking like and it cuts to the outside of the trailer
02:25:50 Like two holes appear in the roof as he comes through the roof of the she's got a double barreled cock. I guess
02:25:55 That's the only seat I've seen of that
02:25:59 All right, guys, let's move on
02:26:01 Let's keep going. Okay, ryan harper with a with a message. Here it is
02:26:08 Hello, I am the democratically elected representative of the detractors of the new pcp theme song
02:26:15 been sent to tell you guys that the whole issue with the theme song is that
02:26:20 It is more of a joke
02:26:22 than a theme the
02:26:25 Whole bit with the guy
02:26:27 doing a woman's voice
02:26:30 It's funny
02:26:33 But it's really force. Well, okay, it wouldn't be funny if it sounded natural
02:26:39 Okay, but because
02:26:42 Do any of us even disagree theme song like really and after hearing it
02:26:48 We all agree the new theme song is wrong, right? No, why did you vote for it? Oh my god, yeah
02:26:55 No, of course not did you we fucking voted for it and it won
02:26:58 Yeah, I mean I voted for it because it was funny until we realized that when you hear it over and over again
02:27:03 It's doesn't it's not it doesn't function this way. I mean, I
02:27:08 I like it like isn't it boring that every episode of adventure time opens them saying come along with me
02:27:13 Like we got it the first time guys. We don't need to hear it every time. Okay. Maybe you liked the second
02:27:18 Maybe you liked the runner-up. I get it. I liked the runner-up too. I also voted for it. I did not listen
02:27:24 It was the one that was just the word pcp in multiple ways
02:27:29 You know what? Yeah, what would be ideal channel trailer? I don't think opening themes are necessary for this show
02:27:37 Well, all right, we don't need to open this can of worms. I don't know. Let's talk about amongst ourselves the next meeting
02:27:42 We'll see what's did you won't be there to speak his opinion. Yeah, that's right. I don't even care. I'm just letting you know
02:27:49 What am I?
02:27:52 I don't care for the rock breakdown, but whatever. Yeah, the rock. Okay
02:27:56 I didn't remember that that was the thing like when I voted for this theme song
02:28:00 It was based on my vague memory of it from months prior. Oh, that sounds like your problem. Rock and roll
02:28:06 That's true. Uh, I I just will say what I've been saying the entire time
02:28:11 This has ever been even an idea is that we don't even need a new theme song. Why?
02:28:17 We always did money don't know don't know so about that. It's about that community engagement
02:28:22 Tom you're fucking insane. If you think that this is built more commuting engagement than I'm
02:28:29 Supposed to you're insane
02:28:32 The problem was that at first we were playing the wrong part of the song as the op but eventually we corrected that and we're playing a
02:28:39 Better part of it and it was no longer a problem in my eyes. So like I don't know what initially
02:28:44 I was a big complainer of us making the ed the op because of the fact
02:28:49 That it sounded wrong as an op but then like we used a different part of it
02:28:53 It was only five seconds long and it wasn't a problem anymore and like
02:28:57 It was like fixed before we made another op
02:29:00 I guess
02:29:03 This is what we
02:29:08 Let him finish this all right say it to go all I wanted to say is that we clearly fucked up
02:29:12 We should have referenced our good friend Jeff the master of what's in an op who could have helped us
02:29:19 Yeah, he's right. Okay. Love. Love you Jeff next message. Here we go. This is from uh mackeys back. I think all right go

02:32:05 It's real bad. I need fucking elbow pads. I'm tearing my fucking body up. My dad is a big time skateboarder
02:32:10 He's got a bunch of dhs tapes of him fucking busting mad shit on a half pipe and he tried to get me in when I was a kid

02:32:32 All right. Yeah, here we go. Here we go. Next one. Uh, this is number six out of 10. Yes
02:32:36 I'm 17 years old calling in with a message. Let's see what he's got for us
02:32:40 Hey guys, so I was reading this book called how to win friends and influence people a book that
02:32:47 And uh, one of their principles is um, do not criticize other people
02:32:51 They say that just to not misconstrue what they mean criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive
02:32:56 And it usually makes them strive to justify themselves. You guys agree with that or you guys completely disagree. I agree
02:33:01 This is a great question. Okay. Okay. I like criticizing people when I don't care about like
02:33:09 You know coming to a some sort of agreement with them. I just want them to be annoyed because they made me annoyed
02:33:15 I'm sure that's usually, you know, that's just bad. Well, that means you're not trying to win friends or influence
02:33:22 Yeah, okay, don't you can criticize go you can you can criticize people but you should credit there's like
02:33:29 I don't know. You just have to do it the right way
02:33:31 You just have to do it in a way that shows that you don't like dislike them or think that they're dumb or that they suck
02:33:37 I like in like a like way like an inception way you want them to like kind of like think that it's their own idea
02:33:43 Right, you gotta ask questions instead of make statements. Yeah, if they're forced to answer badly themselves, it's more impactful
02:33:50 You want to criticize with like well, you don't just want to say oh, well this sucks
02:33:54 You want to be like, okay. Well, I really like the way you did this but this other thing over
02:33:59 I don't know if it really works with this like, you know, you want to like you want to give a little
02:34:02 Nate does this all the time every time we're on the pcp if Nate ever says, uh, I hear what you're saying
02:34:08 That means what you just said was retarded, but I'm not gonna say that that's me saying it in a diplomatic way
02:34:13 Well, okay, like I think that in most situations people are not looking for criticism like
02:34:21 Yeah, um, yeah, just just about 12 hours ago
02:34:24 I put out an album and there was this one guy who left a super long comment like criticizing every fucking song on it and
02:34:31 When I read through it, all I could think was this guy has no idea what my intentions were nor what I think
02:34:39 Of what I've released
02:34:41 Like his criticisms have nothing to do with my feelings on the songs or how I feel about him
02:34:46 But he phrased it in such a way like he was trying to be helpful and it's just like dude
02:34:51 Like you can't help me if you don't know what I'm trying to do
02:34:55 And when people are criticized the reason they go on the defensive is that
02:35:00 They have thought through this more than what they are saying
02:35:05 Like I think the average person
02:35:07 He turned on to us for criticizing
02:35:12 Sure
02:35:17 There is a huge difference between criticizing something
02:35:21 To the person's face and doing so elsewhere
02:35:25 And like this guy this guy who I'm talking about on my album literally said you're a critic
02:35:30 So I guess whatever and I was just like what does me being your critic have to do
02:35:35 With the fact that you're commenting on this because when I criticize things I don't leave them
02:35:41 On the guy who made its page like I I've never made a comment that
02:35:46 Reki Kawahara author of sort out online has read
02:35:50 If you know if someone if someone is looking for criticism, that's one thing in general
02:35:55 I would say okay. I I I do believe in not
02:36:01 Giving criticism to someone unless they specifically asked for it
02:36:04 Like I don't go out of my way to tell someone if I think they're fucking up
02:36:09 Because and I sometimes I feel selfish for that reason because I know that criticizing someone who is not looking for criticism will only
02:36:17 Honestly, it might benefit them to hear it if no one else has told them that they're fucking up
02:36:21 Yeah, but it can also make them hate you a lot. Yeah. Yeah. So that's a cost you have to pay
02:36:27 The reason I don't do it is for selfish reasons because I know that it will not it will usually not benefit them because most people will not
02:36:33 Hear it if they're not looking for it
02:36:36 And they will just hate me and I don't want people to hate me
02:36:38 So I just am like, well, I'm just gonna let this person figure it out on their own
02:36:42 I think because that makes sense because that's because that's how it always has to do
02:36:46 A person will not listen to your criticism unless they have already become mentally ready to receive it
02:36:51 I think one step further though, which maybe is too much
02:36:54 But I just think that like, okay, if I've got like my let's say like friends around me
02:36:58 I see them fucking up and I don't say anything
02:37:00 I personally worry that one day they'll be mad at me for allowing them and not like saying anything
02:37:06 You know what I might be too passive
02:37:09 On on that end like I have benefited greatly from people
02:37:13 Like criticizing me when I didn't want to hear like in the long run
02:37:16 I have looked back and been very grateful
02:37:19 Any specific or credits
02:37:21 No for criticizing me
02:37:24 Um on things and and there are other times when I'm like, I wait, I wish that someone had criticized me
02:37:30 There was one criticism I gave to you Ben recently
02:37:32 I could wait what there was one that I gave to you that I think will benefit you in the long run
02:37:37 You seem to sort of agree with that criticism of was it about uh
02:37:41 Being too like accepting of like
02:37:45 No, no, it was that you you just sing too much and it's not funny
02:37:49 That was the one have you noticed that I have stopped doing it?
02:37:52 I have noticed that I have noticed that so I think Ben singing is mostly hilarious
02:37:58 In small doses sure absolutely specifically if he is singing
02:38:03 Neutral milk hotel. I don't get the five six seven oh nine thing that he does all the time
02:38:10 That's that's an endless war thing. So there you go. Okay, whatever
02:38:13 Uh, it doesn't matter that speaking of stuff like that though
02:38:17 That's that's making me think like the reason why a lot of artists tend to be self deprecating and openly self deprecating
02:38:24 Is that they want to criticize themselves publicly as to like
02:38:29 Allow people to like agree
02:38:31 So that they you know, it's like nobody
02:38:34 It is it well
02:38:35 It's a shield and it's also an invitation because like if I say something of mine sucks
02:38:39 I want somebody I don't want people to say no no no no no no no no what I want people to do is like to
02:38:46 To take that as like
02:38:47 An opportunity to say yeah, I I you know because like people are generally very
02:38:54 You know guarded with their criticism. They don't want to make enemies with anyone. They don't want to make someone upset
02:39:00 So like how do you say please criticize me?
02:39:03 um
02:39:05 Like you I mean you say it like that but like a lot I don't think about it a lot and I think the reason people
02:39:10 like me self deprecate is is like uh like a
02:39:14 A sub uh, what am I thinking of a way to do that?
02:39:17 Subconscious way of doing that. Okay. I so this is
02:39:21 Okay, I think that people probably have the perception that we are all a bunch of like hyper critical
02:39:27 assholes right if anything and I don't necessarily feel that way I
02:39:31 I mean obviously you can do too much, but I respect I respect people
02:39:37 Well, you can be an asshole and criticize someone who doesn't want criticism and no good comes of it
02:39:42 And you just hurt feelings and nothing good happens and obviously that's bad
02:39:45 I respect people who are willing to criticize someone if they honestly believe see them fucking up
02:39:50 I don't think that I do. I think that I am too unwilling to open my mouth if I see someone fucking up
02:39:56 I'm too I'm too willing to be like
02:39:58 I'm just gonna let them deal with it because they're not gonna want to listen to what I have to say about this
02:40:02 Then I will tell you right here and now I will only criticize someone to their face if they ask for it
02:40:09 I'll criticize people all fucking day behind their back
02:40:12 And that could mean in the form of a long form youtube video viewed by seven million people
02:40:18 But like if it's to someone's face, I'm not gonna do it. They don't ask for it because like
02:40:23 I don't believe you can take it like I've criticized people and they haven't been able to take it
02:40:30 I've had people come to me asking for criticism and not be able to take it and like I don't have fucking patience for that
02:40:36 Like I need to have a certain level of trust in you that you actually are going to take this criticism seriously or else
02:40:43 I don't like it's even if I think it can help you
02:40:46 I don't trust you to take it the way I want you to and to like actually learn something from it
02:40:52 Like fuck you. You don't get my criticism. You don't get that help
02:40:55 Did you you do separate you separate people who don't take it well and people who just kindly disagree?
02:41:03 Yeah, but like I there there are people who I mean if you're gonna
02:41:08 If if let's say somebody comes to me asking for criticism
02:41:12 And then I tell them my criticism and then they disagree
02:41:15 And then maybe they they sway me or they don't if I feel like
02:41:20 I've offered my opinion and you just dismissed my opinion
02:41:24 Then I'm just gonna be like well. Why did you ask for my opinion if you were so sure of my of yourself?
02:41:28 Remember remember Dave did you remember Dave?
02:41:31 Uh, I assume you mean the german guy
02:41:34 The german the german writer he was a big part of why I developed like he was a guy who would constantly ask for criticism
02:41:40 And then argue against all of it
02:41:42 Perfect case study. Yeah, perfect. He's like the he's like the he's like he's like patient zero
02:41:47 For uh, he it's like he's like a cartoonish example of someone who would literally a good reason for why I have trust issues today
02:41:55 Might be this particular individual later. He moved on to I mean, I think most people have better sense than Dave
02:42:02 Um, but Dave would come to me and he would say hey ben. I wrote this like story
02:42:07 Or I drew this comic. He was mostly into writing like a novel at the time. I wrote this like chapter of a novel
02:42:13 What do you think and I would read it and be like, okay?
02:42:16 You know no offense
02:42:18 But your english is not fluid and then he would say well
02:42:21 I can't sell anything if I write it in german and then I would say well
02:42:25 Your english isn't good enough to sell in english. So no fucking nobody writes in german
02:42:30 Nobody reads books written in german. I mean to be honest
02:42:34 I didn't think that the humor was very good even if I ignored all the weird like like like esl like
02:42:40 Gaffes and goofs and whatever
02:42:42 But you know even aside might like the the first thing the first thing every time would be like
02:42:46 I'm sorry. I'm sorry if you don't you don't want to hear this but your english just isn't good enough
02:42:50 You do not read like a fluent english speaker like you shouldn't you need to you need to either write in german or improve your english
02:42:56 Like one or the other and he just wouldn't fucking listen
02:42:59 He would and then he would argue against me about why his english was actually right
02:43:03 Like why it wasn't as bad like why why it wasn't as bad as I was telling him
02:43:08 Yeah, even if it's not as bad it has to be if you want to be published
02:43:12 Yeah, yeah, at least get a proofreader. You know, it's not yeah like get get someone to literally
02:43:16 I would tell him that I would tell him you need an editor or a proofreader or something
02:43:20 And he'd be like no, I can't afford one and I'd be like well, sorry
02:43:23 We were supposed to be his proofreaders like he was coming to people
02:43:28 But then he would argue and he would argue against our proofreads. Right. It was really fucking ridiculous. Okay. Yeah
02:43:35 Okay, in those situations. Yeah, that's stupid. I was some people are just hopeless and their ego is too big to accept
02:43:41 You know, whatever criticism. I mean not even saying he's got a huge head
02:43:44 But like if he's not gonna take the the points then there's just useless. It's just useless
02:43:48 I don't I don't know. He was so set. He was like, no, I can't write in german. Why it's your fucking people read people read
02:43:55 Right people read in germany. This guy this guy sounds like somebody amazon bestseller
02:44:00 Like like like I would I would think that writing in german would be a huge advantage because that's a much more niche market
02:44:05 Right, I guess not everybody knows about marketing
02:44:07 So
02:44:10 What was what was he writing anyway? Was it like something anime related or something? It was like a
02:44:16 Furry weird fantasy. Oh, of course. He's a german furry all germans. Yeah
02:44:21 He was he was a furry. He was writing. It was like a sort of fantasy. What is it called when you're a furry, but it's all scales
02:44:27 Scaly scaly
02:44:29 We all know instantly
02:44:31 I was asking I was asking
02:44:33 Uh, this is all about birds. I I had hoped that there was a special word. We were talking about this on iam games, weren't we?
02:44:39 Oh, yeah, yeah, and apparently. Oh, no, variety fuckers. It's just avian. It's not variety fucker scop killers, wasn't it?
02:44:43 One of those two god, there's all of no, I think it was whatever. He was a scaleman. It's all a blur. What's the next fucking voicemail?
02:44:49 Yeah, please god the next voicemail
02:44:51 Uh, we've got we're not even at three hours. This is too long. We're all right. We're getting there. We've got we've got four left
02:44:56 This one is from uh, uh, hang on play. All right. This is from ring grompulation is is this one
02:45:03 Uh, let's let's see what he's got for us. Hey guys, I just wanted to ask what's on the short list for your like personal
02:45:10 cringe compulation
02:45:11 You know when you like think about like at random times like the shittiest thing
02:45:16 Or like me not even like like maybe like a minor thing that you did in middle school that you're just like
02:45:21 Where do I fucking begin?
02:45:23 I have one. I have one
02:45:27 Small man boy a non a non man. I have one. So what's that for you guys my blog?
02:45:34 Okay, that's okay. Okay. I I have one that I honestly feel so terrible and awkward and weird about to this day
02:45:42 and I and I feel like
02:45:44 it's it it's
02:45:46 I've like specifically avoided ever telling the story because it's uncomfortable for me in a way that does not feel fun
02:45:52 Sure. Okay. Um
02:45:54 Maybe don't tell it. Are you gonna tell us now?
02:45:57 I mean, I could I don't think I'd be happy to hear it
02:46:00 Objectively speaking. I don't think it's anything that anyone is going to crucify people probably will throw it in your face
02:46:05 And it doesn't matter if it's bad. It'll if it makes you uncomfortable then, you know, well, I don't know
02:46:10 I think I'm I feel like it's maybe a little overblown. All right. The point is we were we were we were in like
02:46:15 Fucking middle school. I was like probably in like fifth grade or something or maybe fourth grade whatever
02:46:20 and
02:46:21 I don't know why I did this. I don't know why I thought this was funny
02:46:25 but like we were doing like practice speeches for
02:46:28 uh,
02:46:29 fucking like student government like elections like we were
02:46:34 Sitting in the auditorium and we were like the the people who were running for student office were were practicing their speeches
02:46:41 and
02:46:42 one of the girls running was like a couple years older than me. I didn't know her and
02:46:47 she she gives a speech about treasurer and I like
02:46:51 And like this is this is not in front of like a big crowd or anything like that. It's just like and um
02:46:58 The she she gives a speech about running for treasurer or something and like I think she asked for questions
02:47:03 And I think and I decided it would be funny if I like raised my hand and asks like how does a guy get a date with you?
02:47:10 And as like a joke and I was like and like I think it really embarrassed her
02:47:15 And I felt terrible afterwards. I was like, what a weird. Yeah in hindsight like what what a weird
02:47:20 Thing to do like oh that's so mean too because it's like
02:47:22 Oh, she's trying to like do something here and you just hit her with that
02:47:25 You know, it's funny that you're upset like with yourself for that because I feel like the average douche bag does that every week
02:47:32 And I mean maybe yeah, that just shows that you're not such a bad guy
02:47:35 But it was very in hindsight. I realized I think I realized as soon as I said it was out of my mouth
02:47:40 When I saw the look on her face that I was like that this was like a very like demeaning thing to do and I had like
02:47:47 It's real
02:47:48 That's like the worst really where where like the you know the when you you say something and it wasn't even funny
02:47:54 And it wasn't even for a good joke like like the first time in your life where you
02:47:59 Something you say
02:48:01 Doesn't go the way you thought it would in your head and that's that realization of like oh wait
02:48:06 Like oh, oh no, I heard a real person's feelings. Yeah
02:48:10 God, I don't have a specific story like that
02:48:12 But I have had that feeling before of like just fucking up
02:48:15 Terribly in front of people
02:48:18 When I thought I wouldn't
02:48:19 I've got a I've got a small story about this that does haunt me to this day. This was the weirdest
02:48:24 Okay, this was the first time in my life. I attempted to make any kind of sexual advance on anyone
02:48:31 Uh, nice. It was it was nice. Okay. Well, whatever. I'll let you be the judge
02:48:35 Um, there was there was a girl in my class. I don't know what was going on
02:48:39 We were like out. I don't know like feel there. Whatever. We were just in school somewhere and uh, um
02:48:45 Like this girl was a well-known slut and I was like, oh, yeah, all right. This will be easy like yeah
02:48:50 Don't worry. I thought she was kind of cute. You know, I'm she likes to park in cars with boys. Exactly exactly
02:48:57 so
02:48:58 I forget what was going on, but this is how I communicated my sexual interest in her
02:49:04 um, okay, she like
02:49:06 We were I don't know what was going on, but like she like offered her hand. Oh god. This is this is
02:49:11 She there was something going on. She like held her hand. What was that? Where were you?
02:49:16 We were we were outside like doing something like the two of us
02:49:20 Um, was this like a school dance or something? It might have literally been a band camp actually
02:49:25 okay, um
02:49:27 And the way that I communicated my interest was she like held at her hand
02:49:33 Like I grabbed her hand. There was like she had like two fingers up
02:49:39 And I I made the like jacking off gesture on her fingers with my hand
02:49:45 This is what I did
02:49:47 What oh
02:49:49 And she just was like what and I was like that's that's like so forward
02:49:53 It was I know it was incredibly forward like okay. There was we were kind of friends. There had been jokes about sex
02:50:00 Uh, but like this was what I chose to do as my
02:50:05 Method you mean do you mean you guys I was probably sex before or no
02:50:09 Well, no, I mean, I was a virgin for many more years after this. She definitely was not
02:50:13 In fact this same girl, but you and her had joked about sex. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know as a group
02:50:17 That's less awkward. I guess if like the tone had been set to like make humorous
02:50:21 No, well the thing is it wasn't it wasn't like on that level. I made it real in a way that was not anticipated by anyone
02:50:29 I want to know how how old were you? I want to know how old were you?
02:50:32 I was pro I was between 16 and 18. I think somewhere in that oh too old too. Yeah way too old
02:50:38 It was it was too real and weird and uh, no no no no no
02:50:42 It's like when like it's like when the nerdy guy who nobody really likes you get paired up with in class to do something
02:50:48 Your girl in this example and he like starts coming on to you in some ways and you're like, oh christ, dude
02:50:53 What the fuck yeah, what is this when he like when he like when he like pulls out his katana
02:51:00 Like behind the school and like corners you with it and is like we're gonna you're gonna figure enough
02:51:04 We're gonna do sex stuff now and you're like, oh no not again. All right. That's it. What anybody else got when they want to share
02:51:12 I have a story that is something I regret
02:51:16 Okay. Oh, yeah
02:51:18 um, it was uh in school. I remember there was this one classmate that I was really
02:51:23 Really did not get along with him
02:51:26 Um, it was because he kept badgering me rather than like I badgered him
02:51:30 I don't know what his problem was with me, honestly
02:51:33 But he was he was bad to everyone
02:51:35 But I feel like he was picking on me the most but it was hilarious because he was the shortest guy in the class
02:51:40 And I was the short and I was the tallest person in class
02:51:43 So it was like a bit a bit of a hilarious duo now that I think about it
02:51:47 And he's such an odd yeah, and he was so I was walking with my friend
02:51:50 In the hallway and he was behind us with his friends and he was heckling me
02:51:55 I don't remember what he was saying, but he kept, you know
02:51:59 Agitating me. So what I did I just I I I formed the fist and I put all my strength in it
02:52:05 And and I turned around and I tried to punch him, but I ended up punching someone else
02:52:10 and I
02:52:12 And I felt so bad the guy ended up laughing at the guy that got punched
02:52:16 And I was like, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean it. I was gonna punch him and and
02:52:21 The guy ran away. I probably punched him really hard. I think he cried
02:52:25 He ran away and cried the violent violent violent violence has no no no don't off switch for for the lethal force
02:52:33 That was I think like one of the last punches I ever threw and now that I think about it
02:52:38 Just another story of her going too far
02:52:41 Just going going too far in this mad maxi and wasteland that is
02:52:46 Lithuania in the
02:52:47 What early 90s? I regret two things. I regret punching that four guy and I regret not punching the other guy after first
02:52:55 His defenses were down at that point. It was a prime opportunity
02:53:01 All right, anybody else anybody else
02:53:03 I don't know how to answer this question because I am a living cringe compilation
02:53:07 And I could think of a thousand stories at least as embarrassing. I can sum up jumping in I have one. Oh my god
02:53:16 Hit us up. Hit us up. I'm jumping in at like the last five minutes of the podcast
02:53:21 Because this conversation brought back a memory so traumatic and so cringy
02:53:26 That I've never told this story in my life. Okay, I vowed to never tell it
02:53:32 It's kept me up at night for like 20 years probably longer
02:53:37 It's
02:53:40 It's the worst thing I've ever done to another human being in my life and it haunts me to this day
02:53:46 I was like a little kid. I was like seven or eight years old
02:53:50 Just a little stupid little bastard baby shit
02:53:54 And I was at a carnival with my mom
02:53:58 And uh
02:53:59 They had the carnival games and there was a girl who was probably in her 20s or late teens
02:54:03 You know working at the carnival games with the balloons and you throw the thing at the bottles or whatever
02:54:08 And I went up to there with my mom
02:54:10 And
02:54:11 I don't know how it got brought. I think she had like a little kid with her or like a
02:54:15 She mentioned that she had a kid or something. I don't know somehow
02:54:20 It got revealed that this uh
02:54:22 This this lady working at the carnival game had a kid of her own and I was just like this
02:54:27 I was a little baby. I would never do this ever as an adult
02:54:32 Ever
02:54:34 But when I found out that she had a kid the first thing that came to my mind and I said it out loud to her
02:54:41 was
02:54:42 Wow a cheating carney and a bad mother
02:54:45 What?
02:54:54 I do not condone that I did this. This is the worst thing I've ever said to a human being
02:55:00 You said that when I was seven
02:55:02 I have two I have two questions. I have two questions one
02:55:05 What made her a cheating carney and two and two what made her a bad mother?
02:55:10 No, nothing. She didn't need to do anything to me. She did nothing to me. She didn't even cheat. She didn't even cheat or anything
02:55:16 I had no nothing against her whatsoever. I was just for race for class
02:55:21 I hadn't even like thrown the dart yet to confirm that she was cheating in any way
02:55:29 Oh guys
02:55:31 In my stupid like bastard baby shit right like eight-year-old brain
02:55:35 I just for some reason associated like carnies with like people don't like carnies because they cheat
02:55:40 You know like like how oh people don't like lawyers like it was one of those things
02:55:43 I assumed that it was like a stereotype and I just fucking like it just came to my brain
02:55:48 And I said that and the look on this woman's face. She was so
02:55:53 Yeah, did your mom hear you did your mom hear this? Oh, yeah, she heard me and like the woman was so livid
02:55:59 She said get the get out of here. You can't play this game. Get get away from me, which I don't blame her for at all
02:56:04 Yeah, I would have done that. I like if a kid had come up to me and done that
02:56:06 I probably would have left over the counter and kicked it in the face and gone to prison
02:56:10 So I don't blame this woman at all. She was like livid. She said go away you little brat and like
02:56:15 The like the worst part is
02:56:17 Like my mother because she loves me and she's my mom
02:56:20 Like my mother like stood stood there after I like ran away like a little fucking coward
02:56:26 My mom stood there and like defended me. Oh, yeah
02:56:31 That's a losing battle. That's a losing battle. Yeah, like oh, he didn't know what he was saying
02:56:35 He's just like no, I knew what I was saying
02:56:37 You like like she should she should not have defended me. She should have beat the fuck out of me
02:56:42 like in the public square
02:56:44 and um
02:56:45 I don't know since you guys were all debasing yourselves. Yeah, and revealing your darkest most shameful moments
02:56:51 I thought I'd reveal mine
02:56:53 My my story my shameful story is is is it is actually the most like painful memory that I have
02:57:00 The most it's it's yeah, that's that's the one thing that I remember is being like that one that you're ashamed of doing
02:57:07 Yeah, oh, yeah, okay. What the fuck that's the most shameful you've got
02:57:11 Yeah, I mean I hurt someone's feet. I hurt someone's feelings. All right. All right. You know what I'll share one
02:57:17 I'll just share the one that that's probably the strongest in my mind just to fucking
02:57:22 So when I was in fifth grade
02:57:25 It was valentine's day
02:57:27 And I was really I was really hoping to get some kind of love letter from several girls in my class
02:57:33 I had a crush on
02:57:35 However, I did
02:57:37 actually get a love letter
02:57:39 But I had no idea who it was from it just said like I like you or something
02:57:43 I saw this episode of king of the hill and it was your and it was bobby's grandma that actually said to you
02:57:48 That's fucking bizarre
02:57:50 No, I'm looking around class like which like hoping it's one of the girls
02:57:53 I have a crush on like who the fuck sent me this letter
02:57:56 Um, so I'm at gym class and at the very end of gym
02:58:00 A girl comes up to me who I've never seen before in my fucking life and it's like I've got a crush on you
02:58:06 And I having never spoken to a girl before
02:58:10 Just like freak out and don't say anything. I won't look at her in the eyes
02:58:14 I won't say anything to her and I just like get because like gym class is ending
02:58:18 So everybody's getting in lines to go back into the building
02:58:21 So I just kind of like rush into line and my my friend
02:58:27 Not particularly close, but you know, the only friend I had in my class was like behind me in line
02:58:32 and um, I guess this girl is like trying to speak to me, but I'm just like hard line ignoring her and pretending
02:58:39 I don't notice and like
02:58:42 She starts badgering this kid because I guess she can tell we're friends and I say to my friend like hey
02:58:48 Can you like I don't know what to do like can you tell this girl to stop bothering me, right?
02:58:53 And my friend looks at her and says
02:58:55 He hates you. Oh fuck
02:58:58 Oh god, I mean we've gone nuclear
02:59:01 He then tells me that he said this and I'm like ha ha and like she's
02:59:07 She's like crying and he's like laughing and so I laughed too
02:59:14 You had to pick a side you had to pick a side
02:59:17 And so it's so like it was gonna be a fucking queer into girls. So yeah
02:59:21 Exactly. I was staunchly anti-girl at this age. Yeah. Um a few a few like weeks or months later
02:59:29 We're doing like a class thing where um, this is a very bizarre project
02:59:34 Every one of my class had to pick like a famous person from the 1800s
02:59:38 And like we did this thing where we all we were all in the auditorium
02:59:42 And we just like had to stand still like a statue and if someone came up and like touched our hand
02:59:47 We had to give a speech as though we were like a living museum of that person
02:59:52 Okay
02:59:52 So I was George Washington carver and that girl came up and she kept like tapping me over and over again
03:00:00 And I like terrified just kept giving my rote speech of being George Washington carver like I literally was a
03:00:08 installation at a museum just like
03:00:11 Watching this girl like I I very
03:00:14 Clearly remember like her heart broken face like pressing my hand over and over again hoping I'll say something else
03:00:20 Don't treat me like a human being stop with the camera responses, please and and she didn't say a damn word
03:00:25 That was the last I ever saw
03:00:27 Do you like tugging at your sleeve like tearfully like please please please conrat and you're just like did you know that?
03:00:34 I invented peanut butter
03:00:36 Exactly what it was
03:00:40 And that's that's the first thing that comes to buy by that's a good one
03:00:45 That's really funny, but I have easily a dozen stories that embarrassing. I don't know why but I imagine that story
03:00:53 In the style I don't know why but I imagined while you were telling that story that it was like animated
03:01:03 Oh, it doesn't matter people have been talking over me this entire podcast. I don't care anymore. Yeah, sorry
03:01:08 Nobody will ever hear what I say they'll listen back. Uh, uh, uh, uh, Tom munchie. You want to tell stories or should we move on?
03:01:15 How can I top that?
03:01:16 I got nothing
03:01:18 Oh, I there was one time where I hit my brother over the head with a metal detector
03:01:22 And I felt bad about it. I hit victor with the face of the microwave door
03:01:26 That was pretty awesome. I threw a kettle at my sister's head as a child and I don't know what got into me over there
03:01:31 I wasn't a child. I was 21 when I hit victor with the microwave door
03:01:36 When we were fighting over who would get my friend's hamburger
03:01:41 That he offered to victor, but I felt entitled to it. So I
03:01:48 There are many stories about things I shouldn't have done
03:01:52 Sort of like digi but not in the sense that there are too many good ones
03:01:55 But just in the sense. I don't know what people will gravitate towards
03:01:58 There most of them are just like
03:02:00 Not embarrassing in the sense of like, ooh, who weren't you like a kooky child?
03:02:04 But like weren't you kooky like three or four years years ago and therefore aren't you just a terrible person?
03:02:12 Uh, I don't know. I mean I a lot of embarrassment just comes from like
03:02:18 Me saying things which would have been funny if I were on the internet and not terribly awkward
03:02:25 But like me trying to do edgy humor outside of like like an offline like
03:02:31 Just at a school and it coming up really weird and terrible and like
03:02:37 I don't know like I like I like I just would speak in some sort of like grotesque internet meme
03:02:43 And I would say something gross and then people would be like wow
03:02:46 What a gross asshole and then not talk to me anymore and I would think you know what maybe I should have seen this coming
03:02:53 Like why don't they get it when I when I when I say gamers rise up bottom text and strike the awkward penguin pose
03:03:00 Why don't they like get that? Yeah, what's I don't understand?
03:03:03 What have they never been on four champs?
03:03:05 There was well, there was one time where I was just talking to some girl and I was and I was joking about how one time
03:03:10 I saw like like like like there was this one image
03:03:13 I saw someone who like cooked their their period blood into bacon and ate it and she looked really upset
03:03:20 And I was like, oh, yeah, I guess you're not supposed to say that to people
03:03:24 How does one hook their period blood into bacon? Well, I put it on there. Yeah hook in why not why not?
03:03:34 You eat the placenta you cook the period blood. This is really gross
03:03:38 I'm imagining like a link cable from your pussy to the
03:03:42 Well digi they have those they have those rubber cups now that that that you just stick right up there and it goes into a cup
03:03:49 So you can pour it into anything you want you cook blood into you cook blood into like black pudding
03:03:54 Yeah, that's true. So like why not use it. I guess I did a couple months ago
03:03:58 I had a foe that had uh, it was like a blood foe. Oh god not a period
03:04:04 Like an foe like a blood like a blood. I have many blood foes
03:04:10 I have a new blood foe every day
03:04:13 Yeah, all right guys next fucking question. Shall we?
03:04:18 All right, I apologize to the carnival lady. I'm sorry
03:04:21 She hears you out there. So lying car a cheating car
03:04:27 All right, here we go. Uh, this is from suole as far as I can tell. All right go
03:04:32 Yo, okay, so munchie college. It's a bad idea. Everything you're saying sounds exactly like what I was
03:04:38 Maybe I'll make friends or something
03:04:40 No, like like everyone's saying about the financials and like I get it
03:04:44 But if you're saying like no, I've got it handled
03:04:45 I have to argue with you on a more important point
03:04:47 Which is the fact that the experience is not valuable you think it will be right now
03:04:51 But the amount of like real world knowledge that you will gain by actually being an adult and not being in some weird like daycare facility
03:04:57 For adults is so much greater if you actually just move somewhere and start your career
03:05:01 You're so lucky to be so young and have so many people actually care about what you're making on the internet right now
03:05:05 You could just bend st. Style
03:05:07 Start making shit and people would love it and you could be good
03:05:12 You think oh man, I'm gonna meet people. No, everyone in college is like a fucking super
03:05:16 Libtar'd like no, it's not gonna work. There are some good people you probably will make a friend
03:05:20 But here's the thing munchie. It's not a good idea
03:05:22 You can make plenty of friends just by being a normal human being being in a classroom in college
03:05:26 It's not like being in the classroom. I love this guy. He never stopped and no one talks to each other. It's a huge problem
03:05:31 No one gets along. It's listen high school is like the most. I mean college is the most
03:05:36 Fucking like denigrating experience ever will destroy you won't learn anything you can't learn from a book or by actually making things yourself
03:05:42 That's the most important thing just push yourself to keep practicing and you will become good
03:05:49 I I like honestly
03:05:51 I love the kind of that man's gym that guy's a fucking
03:05:55 So what I want to respond let munchie respond to two things first of all the
03:06:00 Two things that come in like every college discussion, which I don't understand
03:06:05 Are the speaking with absolute certainty about all colleges ever and the and the all bad
03:06:11 All colleges ever. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You can't you can't like going to college is a mistake all the time
03:06:18 I don't know about that. No
03:06:21 I feel confident
03:06:24 I'm worried about the liberal people in colleges nowadays
03:06:29 They're not that's not
03:06:33 You're gonna get off like some some some chick with a green side cut is gonna like is gonna come and like burn your house down
03:06:38 Okay, you guys have to remember that munchie is a libcock. So this is not a problem. Yeah. Yeah
03:06:45 Also, for me, I think the biggest concern I would question directly at me now
03:06:50 It's the yeah, I know, right? No, I'm just saying like because I was thinking about this after the conversation
03:06:55 You and I had about college munchie is that like
03:06:58 You were you were implying that you were like, oh, I'll come over to your house every weekend
03:07:02 And I'm like, how the fuck are you gonna have time for that if you're in college?
03:07:05 I like a serious college. I understand that that I should I misspoke and I'm and I said that like well
03:07:12 Well, not every weekend in the conversation, which you're referring to I misspoke every weekend is not realistic
03:07:18 Uh to go back to what the guy was saying
03:07:22 Okay, the second thing uh like aside from speaking as though, you know about every
03:07:29 Social like like group in every college ever aside from that
03:07:32 Also the just be a real person in quotes and you'll be just fine
03:07:39 I don't know like okay
03:07:41 If I were to just continue what I'm doing now what I would be doing what I'm doing right now
03:07:47 Aka never leaving the house and only talking to people online and doing my art slowly
03:07:53 So if that's that's what the equivalent would be
03:07:57 Going to college is being a real person all of you guys are wrong college is good being a youtuber is morally fucking
03:08:04 Reprehensible, I would give anything to have not dropped out of college
03:08:07 Wait, wait, it felt like the only two options here are be a youtuber or go to college
03:08:13 No, well, they're making it sound like oh drop out of college and be an artist
03:08:17 Here's an idea fuck faces stay in college and be an artist
03:08:20 And maybe don't ruin your entire life by dropping out and devoting everything to this fucking dead end of an artistic career
03:08:27 When I hear quote be a real person, I think get a cubicle job is what this guy is saying
03:08:32 Okay, okay, the thing that the thing that stands out to me most about what this guy's saying
03:08:36 Is the idea that there is nothing that you learn in college that you can't learn from a book
03:08:41 Or somewhere else like they don't have a monopoly on like secrets
03:08:45 Ben, of course, they don't have a monopoly on all knowledge
03:08:50 But like there are of an ensure you can learn some technical skill in books
03:08:56 But like what I've said a thousand times
03:08:59 I will have an instructor with me who is instructing me on a personal basis
03:09:04 He is helping me through things as well. I will be surrounded by constant artists. That might be great
03:09:09 That might be great or it might suck ass
03:09:12 Okay, obviously there is risk, but it is an educated decision
03:09:16 I'm making based on literally attending not a metaphorical college, but a college. I'm going to
03:09:23 Munchy, I'm not
03:09:25 Being a digi here and I'm not saying that college is a bad idea and you will regret it
03:09:29 You might not but I am saying that you you can't you can't tell me that you have it
03:09:33 It's an educated decision because you don't know
03:09:36 We you you look you will not know if it was a if it was regrettable and a mistake
03:09:41 You can talk to people who've been there and you know until after no, I'm not look you just won't know
03:09:45 Okay, it's just a fucking crapshoot. That's all I'm saying. It's a crapshoot. It's not a crapshoot. It's just always bad
03:09:53 Tell me one time. I've ever been wrong about anything
03:09:56 Oh
03:09:58 I didn't like the anime you recommended
03:10:00 Like like what shit wait made you didn't like angel of death
03:10:04 I I liked it at the beginning, but the further I got the worst. Well, I only saw the first two episodes
03:10:09 I can't you can't judge. Oh, I would I didn't see the whole show
03:10:12 I it seemed like your kind of thing based on how much I saw
03:10:16 I apologize that the show went to shit from your perspective. It's okay
03:10:21 I wasn't wrong at the time
03:10:24 Oh, I'll give you that much digi you're not there's nothing nothing is guaranteed
03:10:29 Of course and no matter how educated you think you are you could end up regretting it
03:10:34 Here's the thing you will you will end up in debt. You might end up okay with that
03:10:39 Maybe then of course that is true. I'm not saying I'm guaranteed to enjoy college
03:10:45 But again, I'm playing the odds and there's also no guarantee that I'll be able to make a living on the internet
03:10:52 With no sort of a hand and like foot in the industry whatsoever. There's no guarantee in that either
03:10:58 Okay, but but I'm just saying the idea solution to that is to just accept a large amount of debt and then pay that off
03:11:05 That's not all that I'm doing
03:11:08 You know, that's not all that as a man with debt
03:11:11 I can definitely say having debt is the worst part of my life and the biggest regret I have and the thing
03:11:17 I most wish I didn't have sure the idea that somebody on a fucking podcast
03:11:23 Can wave their hand over all of it and say that college is always a bad idea no matter who you are is insane
03:11:28 Well, only did you say that you're
03:11:30 Yeah, I know just like the idea that like say your father is saying if you don't go to college
03:11:34 You'll fail no matter what is also insane. Of course. Nice. Okay. Here's why here's why college didn't work for me
03:11:40 Because I I went to a community college. I didn't have the money or the grades or whatever to go to a real university
03:11:46 So I didn't really meet people or it didn't really take it seriously
03:11:49 And I went into college with an attitude of I don't need this I'm gonna be an artist
03:11:53 So why am I here? So I fucking I I floundered in it for three years and then dropped out
03:11:59 but
03:12:00 If you have the chance if you have the real opportunity
03:12:04 If you if you have to take if you have to like get yourself into debt to go to college
03:12:07 And you don't think it's for you then it's not for you
03:12:08 But if you have the opportunity to go to a real university then it is an experience that is valuable
03:12:13 You will probably make friends. You will probably learn something
03:12:16 You will probably get a good career out of it eventually
03:12:19 I just I've never known anybody who I respected who went to college
03:12:25 I went to college. You asshole
03:12:30 Tom you wait. Well, you did wait tom. Do you have a degree? Yeah, you do have a degree
03:12:35 Yeah, but you don't you you hate college. Okay. Let me replace that Ben is a degree
03:12:38 But I've never known anybody who went to college and didn't regret it that I respect
03:12:43 I don't entirely regret it. Well, I don't regret it. Well, hippo, you don't
03:12:50 You're from England. It's different
03:12:52 I I went to a social function a smash tournament at the school that I want to go to and it was a nice time
03:13:00 I didn't like make a new friend. I hope I hope to god
03:13:04 Guys, please we already had this argument before and I don't think we're bringing up anything new
03:13:10 You're not trying to tell me that you
03:13:13 That a smash tournament is an argument in favor of college. No, I'm not what no
03:13:18 Obviously, okay. Okay. Maybe if everyone would stop fucking speaking over me
03:13:21 So I can actually say what I'm trying to say and not just say one sentence of it
03:13:25 And then I have to stop munchy
03:13:26 I have to keep arguing because I have to keep increasing the time that I'm on this podcast so I can get paid for it
03:13:31 Now that I've jumped in
03:13:34 I'm not saying oh, I won't go to college because there's smash tournaments. That'll be cool. That's not at all
03:13:39 What I'm saying don't even like get that out of your mind immediately. That's I mean, yeah
03:13:43 I thought that that would be ridiculous. I just don't understand. Oh my god. Did you I can't believe you right now
03:13:50 After I just said that I want people to stop in or under me you come in saying something
03:13:55 Obviously, it's just hard because everything you say is obviously fucking retarded
03:14:00 Anything you have to say
03:14:02 At all munchy, please continue. I'm saying that I went
03:14:07 People are saying you you won't make friends the guy in the bush now saying you won't make friends
03:14:11 You just won't do it. But I went to a social function
03:14:14 I went to a social function and it was great. Sure. I don't have like oh like hit me up on discord
03:14:19 They are we're best friends now
03:14:20 But it was nice to hang out with people and it wasn't an air of like, oh, I don't know what I'm doing
03:14:25 I can't make friends here. I've been with the same sort of cultural
03:14:28 Like I've been to this school and I don't dislike the culture at all. It will be fun
03:14:33 I feel like anyone who says you won't make friends is just a weird person who wouldn't make friends anywhere
03:14:38 Yeah, like obviously that's wrong, but this whole friend argument is weird
03:14:42 It's like it sort of feels like we're arguing past the point because like yeah, you you you can make friends at college
03:14:48 But you can make friends
03:14:49 I feel like munching can easily make friends in any circumstance
03:14:52 He was in like there's no reason to go to dude everyone listening to this because I feel like most of the people who
03:14:57 Listen to the procrastinators are like in their late teens probably that's the demographic
03:15:01 They're probably you know weighing their options of whether to go to college if you can go
03:15:06 Fucking be young be young and be around other young people for the love of god
03:15:10 Do not be 29 years old and be a fucking youtuber and having a crisis. I want to go back to college
03:15:15 That's all I want in the world. I want to go back
03:15:17 Don't be a youtuber, but don't go to fucking college
03:15:19 Just get a regular fucking job like a normal human like 90 percent of the population who are fucking fine
03:15:27 You can go to college after the regular job and not have fucking death let people make their own choices about their own lives
03:15:35 If you've got the opportunity to go to college
03:15:37 Don't let people make choices about their own lives because don't make the wrong choices. Everyone lives their life fucking wrong
03:15:44 Hold on we are all people who have lived wrong and have the opportunity to tell people how to how to avoid the mistakes
03:15:51 We've made
03:15:53 I didn't make any mistakes. I made all the right decisions at every point
03:15:57 I came in like an agent of chaos
03:16:01 If you have the opportunity to go to school and you won't settle yourself with debt
03:16:05 Yeah, it's probably a great idea, but like it's the trade-off. Okay. It's the trade-off of a huge amount of debt
03:16:11 Oh
03:16:15 May or may not benefit you
03:16:18 Dang it. Oh, we're gonna get copyright claimed. We play that too long
03:16:23 No, it's from a video game. You can play video game music. Oh, okay. You might be right. You might be right about that
03:16:28 I I just want to say that I think it's really hilarious
03:16:31 that like
03:16:33 Munchy is constantly defending college from the standpoint of not having gone to an audience of everyone else who has gone to college
03:16:42 No, you're you're you're disparaging it from someone who never finished
03:16:49 I don't give a shit
03:16:51 Everyone I've ever told it's not just me. It's not like I haven't spoken to countless people who've been to college
03:16:56 It's not like I've haven't I don't have a huge
03:16:59 I am someone who's been to college and I don't even think it's bad. I'm not even against it
03:17:04 I'm skeptical, but I'm not like unilaterally saying the college is bad
03:17:08 Uh
03:17:09 Me hey munchy
03:17:10 Do you want to live the life of ben saint living with nine other dudes and making 400 dollars a month for the rest of your life?
03:17:16 Yeah, that's the lifestyle you want. Ben seems pretty fulfilled in his life. Well, then you'll be fine. Go to college
03:17:21 Wait a minute. Wait wait ben's life being like that isn't because he went to college. It's because he became an artist
03:17:27 When he was both are equally the problem. Yeah, okay, but he does have no I mean
03:17:31 No, becoming an artist was the right choice for me and I'm fucking happy with my life digi you asshole
03:17:37 I know you're happy with your life. I'm asking munchy if he would be happy with your digi
03:17:41 Here's the thing. I'm in front of a panel of people who have been to college
03:17:45 Who do I like the most out of this group who I like want to I'm sorry. I shouldn't say like that. It's a very mean thing to say
03:17:51 I
03:17:52 I mean, who do I respect?
03:17:54 Who do I respect? Like what kind of life do I want to lead? Oh hippo ben?
03:17:58 They both went to college and say it been in ben's case. Oh not like not a bad thing
03:18:04 You know there you gotta brood the prawns hippo was just yeah. Yeah, it was cool. It was good. Yeah. Well. I want to do that
03:18:10 Well, go ahead faggot. Well, I'm just letting you know that it's the worst decision you could ever make
03:18:17 Hey, man. Look, I used to visit my buddy who went to uh, michigan state, which is an actual college
03:18:22 Yeah, I used to visit him. I'd come there for st patty's day and it was beautiful
03:18:26 It was amazing
03:18:27 He would just walk around the college town going into everyone else's apartment
03:18:30 Having part every every every single house or apartment had a party in it with drinks and girls and fun and friendship
03:18:35 He was friends with the whole town go to college and you'll be just like that guy
03:18:39 Every time it's it's always good. I'm just saying that I'm now
03:18:43 I'm making the generalization
03:18:46 I'm going to college. It's like saying I'm gonna get an abortion on myself. It's like I hate my life
03:18:52 And I want to die like listen, but I I'm going to college. It's like saying I want to be castrated
03:18:58 If you go to college if you go to college, you can become an abortion guy
03:19:03 Professor and you can do that. You can be I just think it should be flexible
03:19:06 And if you don't you shouldn't feel like like if you like you need to fend like like if college
03:19:12 Isn't working you should be willing to
03:19:15 I'm not saying that I will
03:19:18 Like college is the best decision to me for definitively 100 percent. Of course there is risk and I understand
03:19:24 I'm sorry if I seem more to senses than usual. I'm just annoyed
03:19:28 But yeah, that's fine. I'm on team munch. I I believe in you boy. It's fine to be annoyed munchy
03:19:34 I understand why you're annoyed. I'm just annoyed every time anybody says the phrase. I'm going to college to me
03:19:41 Well, like every time I hear that phrase. I think oh great. Oh great. You're perpetuating everything I hate in the world
03:19:48 Great
03:19:51 Everything the same as it's been who fucking cares you have the opportunity to do anything else
03:19:58 But you're gonna do the same thing great. I wish the best for you
03:20:02 No, don't don't wish the best for me. Don't change stop. No more look
03:20:08 Can I can I make one here's how I win this conversation because conversations are about winning
03:20:13 So here's how I win it. They're not about understanding each other
03:20:16 No matter what you do in life, you're going to regret it. Whatever you do to your 20
03:20:21 You're gonna regret it when you're 30. So just do whatever you want, man
03:20:25 Everyone just do whatever you want. I win
03:20:28 Uh, yeah final point on this. I think this is a real actually big brain intelligent point
03:20:33 It's that I think that college
03:20:36 Is kind of the pleasures of childhood and then like working
03:20:40 This is not meant to be demeaning and then like whatever like getting a job
03:20:42 That allows you to get like the pleasures of adulthood
03:20:45 I think the pleasures of adulthood are better like having control of your life sooner and you know
03:20:50 Like what not going into debt being financially solvent
03:20:53 That's that's the main reason why I think that I mean and I would never say college isn't right for anyone including munchy
03:20:59 Uh, it's just you know, like well if you want to be a doctor, you got to go to college and a conversation
03:21:03 Uh, you know, but if you want to be a doctor, you're not a human being
03:21:08 Well, all right, fair enough fair enough. I want to be a doctor
03:21:10 I I I have um, I have like secret dreams of being a psychologist or a therapist. I
03:21:16 That's not a doctor
03:21:18 What are you talking about actually you need your doctor
03:21:23 I think about that a lot like I really want to go back to college and like major in psychology or something
03:21:28 So I can like do you actually have a doctor to be a psychologist
03:21:31 Well, you can be like a therapist without a literal doctor
03:21:33 I think or a sociologist you do not require a medical degree
03:21:37 You're you're not a medical doctor, but you do but you do you need you need your ph
03:21:41 You need your phd, which is a doctor. My buddy. My buddy's a psychologist. He uh, he went to a lot of school. It's crazy
03:21:48 Psychologists are cool. Psychiatrists. There's no one. I trust less in this world
03:21:52 Psychiatrists are actually like more
03:21:54 I mean, they're the one with the more exacting like medical degree. That's true
03:21:59 They're the people who I am thoroughly disgusted by
03:22:03 All right, let's move on to the next we got two questions left people here
03:22:07 Mr. Waffle guy is the one so here he goes with his question
03:22:14 All right, so on the halloween and student debt episode. We got a really good discussion about monkey's college plans
03:22:24 And what hippos got besides youtube
03:22:27 That's all fantastic. I loved it. But my brain mouth requires more
03:22:32 Feed it. It's greens. Give me the sustenance of the plans of the rest of the pcp methods
03:22:38 Anyone else on the episode? Where do you want to take yourself in the future?
03:22:42 Where do you see yourself and not only individually, but with the pcp? Or do you plan on doing?
03:22:48 Well, I've been tensed. I'm not going to college anymore and the and that that no one should go to college
03:22:52 So now I've officially abandoned that idea. So now I don't know those futures right open
03:22:56 I'm it looked like a career in homelessness. It's looking pretty good right now. You know just
03:23:00 I I I my career is going to be I'm going to become andrew hussey, but good
03:23:06 It's what I'm going to do. That sounds good. So you'll be toby fox then you'll be toby fox
03:23:11 Uh, yeah, but I'll have a different name called my name toby bison or you know
03:23:15 I don't have like a long term like step by step plan. I know that I'm gonna finish max surviving tbap and then
03:23:23 Uh, take a take a break takes like a social media break and go away for a while until vapors three is done
03:23:29 I just all I have is a list of projects. I don't have a life plan. All I have is a list of projects
03:23:33 I mean, that's and they go to tbap vapors three
03:23:37 Biscopades champion two and that's it. That's not that's almost admirable about more than anything
03:23:43 I think more than anything like life goal than you could have just having a list of projects. That's really nice
03:23:47 That's all I have. That's all I am is my list of products
03:23:50 All I am is my list of projects and the fucking bullshit standing between me and them. What a beautiful future
03:23:55 I feel that I feel that hardcore Ben
03:23:58 Well, my my current plan is next year to downsize my living situation because I overexerted myself moving into a place
03:24:05 That was too expensive. So I'm going to move into a less expensive place
03:24:10 Uh, try to reduce my cost of living while saving up so I can pay off the debt
03:24:15 I have to the government over taxes. Good plan. Eventually pay off the taxes
03:24:21 Um, once that's sorted out
03:24:23 Try to move my career in a way that I don't have to be so focused on having to do anything mainstream whatsoever
03:24:30 um
03:24:31 moving in a more artistic direction try to work with other people more because I'm
03:24:36 Increasingly less interested in what I can do by myself and more and what I can do with other people
03:24:41 um, so try to do that and then uh,
03:24:45 Maybe two or three years from now
03:24:48 Fuck off from all of it and go have a kid
03:24:52 Somewhere and two or three years in the mountains become a you want you want you want big digi
03:24:58 You want to talk about you might as well be saying i'm gonna abort myself. They'll have a fucking kid. I want to abort myself
03:25:04 Why would I hold on? What's the point of living at all?
03:25:09 What's the point of making a new life if I make a kid? Maybe he can do something he can make good
03:25:17 The point of life is the experience of living which you are giving up
03:25:21 You are giving up for some other person to have those experiences instead
03:25:25 Like consider this as a 27 year old nothing is fun to me anymore
03:25:30 However, having a kid I can experience fun again vicariously through that. Oh, you are a fucking idiot. What the fuck?
03:25:38 What's an idiot about that? What are you talking about? I think I think having a kid is not stupid
03:25:43 Everybody remember back when like christmas was fun and like you you you like enjoyed like doing things with people like
03:25:53 Stop chasing the pleasure of childhood and embrace the pleasure
03:26:02 They're about mastering your life and doing what you want and having a child can be one of them
03:26:06 What is more mastering your life than
03:26:08 Having well, I don't know what I'm arguing because it's fine to have a kid. Just I don't know
03:26:12 Man, yeah, I like I would like to see a new new lull arc of digi
03:26:18 Individually as human beings we have very little impact on the world
03:26:22 Continuing the legacy of humanity is far more important than anything we can do
03:26:26 That sounds like the most selfish reason to have a child imaginable. What is selfish about that?
03:26:32 What is selfish about wanting to continue the human fucking race like selfish would be being like
03:26:37 I'm gonna perfect myself and never continue humanity
03:26:40 Because I'm totally gonna have such a huge impact on the younger generation
03:26:45 Like like you don't need to continue humanity like it doesn't need continuing. It's gonna continue just fine
03:26:50 Oh, well, I mean, okay, somebody's gotta do it. Take responsibility and do it. You know
03:26:55 Fuck fuck it. No, man. Oh, fuck you. Let me tell you
03:26:58 I just want to be happy. That's my hope for the future. I just want to find something that brings me peace
03:27:04 I'm already happy
03:27:08 The point the point of life the point of life is the experience of it
03:27:12 And I don't I mean sorry if this is fucking selfish or whatever
03:27:15 But I don't want to give that up so that someone else can have what is giving up about how I don't understand
03:27:20 How having a kid is giving up anything you fucking being a parent is fucking boring
03:27:28 Kids are automatically more interesting than anyone your own age. No everyone my age
03:27:34 I already thoroughly understand. You're all the same as me. You're all fucking boring. All kids think the same shit
03:27:40 All kids think the same shit. They haven't had an original thought and they're shitty lives
03:27:44 They're worthless like 14 and like they understand a world you can't even conceive of because they've been fucking
03:27:50 Don't be just by then you're already and you fucking thought all their shit every listen kids are boring because by the time you have them
03:27:57 You have already thought every thought they'll ever have like a hundred times over. Maybe when they're like 30
03:28:02 Maybe when they're 30 if they're a super genius
03:28:04 Maybe they'll like seed your fucking mental capacity and teach you something
03:28:08 You're you're so fucking smart that your kid has to be a super genius to teach you anything
03:28:13 That's what you're saying then look at what what we do compared to what our parents experienced in their life and just
03:28:19 Just think about the radical difference and how they're able to kind of understand it through us
03:28:25 I'm just saying that has value. I don't want to understand things through people. I want if look, okay
03:28:31 Maybe maybe 20 years down the line. There will be a new cultural paradigm
03:28:35 I don't want to experience that cultural paradigm vicariously through a fucking, you know creature that I made
03:28:41 I want to fucking be involved in it. I want to be involved in it myself
03:28:45 I want to be I want to be relevant myself. Look ben. I completely agree which is why the smart man does both
03:28:51 That's what I say, uh by the way for the record. I think being a father is cool
03:28:56 I I think it's super cool. I mean if you do it well, you know, it's definitely the least cool thing
03:29:02 What are you?
03:29:05 All right guys
03:29:07 This is like a fucking it's always sunny episode. We're like they can't solve any problem without having a four hour argument
03:29:13 About nothing. That's pretty much true
03:29:16 This is absolutely true. All right, let's get to our final question. Shall we?
03:29:21 We're pretty split on all these
03:29:24 All right final message of the day. This is from it's from our boy crunchy crunches right again. No, I don't
03:29:32 Let's see what let's hear. What do you got this?
03:29:36 Wait, it didn't it didn't load properly. Hang on nightmare. This is this is gonna be good. I probably uh, let's see
03:29:43 It's already fucking dark at 440. What the fuck?
03:29:50 You survived my missile
03:29:53 But you will not be so lucky this time
03:29:57 Will you see I have a new mission and it puts all of your lives at risk
03:30:04 The pcp dating sim is real and it is coming. We have made good progress
03:30:11 We have already completed half the entire soundtrack in just one week
03:30:17 Costume designs have been finalized and all assets are well underway
03:30:24 The only thing we're missing is writers
03:30:28 If you are interested in writing steamy shit
03:30:33 Go to twitter.com at pcp dating and join the discord
03:30:40 Join the fun or else you will be eliminated
03:30:44 I have them snakes here with me
03:30:48 And if you don't go you will split into the first pieces and inject all of you with his them snakes
03:30:55 Venom and you will die
03:30:59 This is real loud
03:31:08 I just I just want to say that I'm very very disappointed that that cat is out of the bag about them
03:31:14 I really thought no one I thought I thought I could hide his existence forever. That that gave me a stroke. Yeah. Yeah
03:31:21 Yeah
03:31:22 a pcp dating I guess at pcp dating check it out
03:31:25 I guess I just want to say that that that that was like probably one of the funniest things on like the past like
03:31:33 50 pcps
03:31:35 Like not just on the strength of it, but the fact that I was experiencing such emotional turmoil and then and then almost if on like
03:31:43 Q narratively
03:31:45 The levity accusations hurled at me have devolved into hello
03:31:50 It's me the the embodiment of a cartoon villain
03:31:55 Um, that's incredible. Um, I couldn't plan it better myself and frankly it almost makes me forgive you for being a part of the pcp
03:32:02 Dane sim which is a fake project which isn't actually happening
03:32:06 It's actually happening in the in in the sense that people say that it's happening
03:32:10 Blast eye check it's just been people sitting on their thumbs and doing fucking nothing
03:32:14 So okay frank the the idea that the sound guys the soundtrack is half done and wow we make such progress
03:32:20 I mean come on that's
03:32:21 Let's you know what guys prove this wrong. I have heard nothing about this. Is this a thing I didn't fucking know
03:32:26 I'd share with like for it to be real right now
03:32:29 How did they make a soundtrack first without having anything written?
03:32:32 I don't know
