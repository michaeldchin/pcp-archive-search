00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:04 I'm the best guy ever. Let's see who we've got in the menagerie today. We've got Gibbontake.
00:00:10 A-yup, lad.
00:00:12 We've got Tom Oliver.
00:00:16 Yeah, me too.
00:00:18 Ah, she has some fucking enthusiasm. You pathetic, cum-addled brain losers.
00:00:22 You fucking coomer.
00:00:23 Yeah, Ben's saying it. There he goes. Tell you tell him, Ben. Who tell him?
00:00:26 Coomer extraordinaire.
00:00:28 You're no better though, you are.
00:00:29 Audience, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry the show is not good anymore. It's my fault. Please.
00:00:36 Coomer on the streets. Coomer in the sheets.
00:00:39 I want to be that big army guy who's shielding that little kid in the bed from all the attacks and death attacks.
00:00:46 You know that political cartoon? This is a little baby boy sitting lying in the bed.
00:00:51 I can think of a way better example. There's this incredible image.
00:00:53 My soul is just like, hmm, as flames and knives blast him from behind to protect him.
00:00:58 That's the gay millennial version of the actual good one.
00:01:01 The soldier is me. The PCP is the baby.
00:01:04 Okay, I appreciate that. But the better one is there's a glorious knight in shining armor shielding a beautiful princess as they're walking through a thing.
00:01:12 As the crowd is throwing shit and he's protecting her. God, I love that fucking image.
00:01:16 Anyway, we've got Digibro. There he is.
00:01:19 This is the first time I've been awake at the time this show is recorded since the last episode that I was on.
00:01:25 I think that was at least a month ago.
00:01:29 I don't even remember who are you again?
00:01:33 No one knows.
00:01:35 I'm that guy who isn't in the endless war.
00:01:38 What? In 2019?
00:01:42 I know.
00:01:44 And Lethal Aurora Mage. There she is.
00:01:47 You exist as I always do.
00:01:49 You do exist, Mage. And how? And let me just start off by saying let's get this out of the way, everybody.
00:01:54 Ladies and gentlemen, you will have seen on the PCB channel by now the release trailer.
00:01:59 Right now at this very moment, the PCP Minecraft server is live.
00:02:04 It is live. It is active. It is a thriving community already. No doubt.
00:02:08 And you can be a part of it for a monthly. It's got a separate Patreon, $5 and you're in the Discord and you can play the game every month.
00:02:16 That's how it is. It's got to be incredible.
00:02:18 Get excited.
00:02:19 Come join us. Play with us. We want to play with you. It's fun. It's going to be fun.
00:02:23 Okay, that's out of the way. We can move on with our lives.
00:02:26 But that is the most important thing we'll say today.
00:02:28 I just have to ask, how long do you think you're going to play Minecraft for?
00:02:32 Who can say?
00:02:34 Let's say it lasts two months.
00:02:37 I mean, I think Mage will be playing it until the day she dies in 2020 by my hand.
00:02:46 That's for me. I don't know.
00:02:48 Wow. Wow, Ben. Wow.
00:02:50 I expect to check in regularly.
00:02:52 Besides, like if we use it for streams and stuff, we like, I don't know, do stuff there.
00:02:56 It could be a gold mine. And you know, why not try it?
00:02:58 I just, I read the bones and that's what they told me. Don't hate me. Hate the bones, okay?
00:03:04 Hey, what's up guys? Nate from the future here.
00:03:06 Hey, one clarification point about the Minecraft server, just to make sure everybody understands exactly how this is working,
00:03:12 is we are going to be grandfathering in everybody with a PCP pledge of the $10 or up,
00:03:18 of which there's a handful of people.
00:03:20 Those people are going to be given access to the server now without having to go pledge any additional money to the new Patreon.
00:03:27 But for everybody else who isn't currently at 10 or higher, everybody else has to go pledge to the new patreon.com.
00:03:37 So don't bother raising your pledge up to $10 that isn't going to work for you.
00:03:41 We're trying to make a clear distinction here.
00:03:43 So if you want to get in the server, you got to go to the new Patreon and pledge the $5 there.
00:03:48 If not, that's totally cool. Don't worry about it. Have a great day.
00:03:52 And again, that's patreon.com slash PCB Minecraft. See you there.
00:03:57 What were we talking about?
00:03:59 Well, I mean, let's get into it, whatever else is going on.
00:04:03 Hey, you guys, I suddenly remembered that drawing can be fun again, right?
00:04:12 Because I'm drawing fucking Endless War comics. I'm drawing fucking Nightstar comics.
00:04:18 I'm drawing fucking Phantom Horn comics.
00:04:21 I just read all of that like two days ago.
00:04:24 I can't believe how fast you're fucking putting it out.
00:04:27 It is incredible.
00:04:29 Fucking blast. I've made like 110 images, 120 images, something like that.
00:04:34 It's really fun.
00:04:37 In the span of like a couple of weeks, right?
00:04:40 Well, a couple of them I made a while back, like the first like 15 or so.
00:04:45 But other than that, yeah.
00:04:47 I think initially it was more born out of the excitement over meeting Chris Chan, right?
00:04:53 It was because the genesis of this, the genesis of the love hogs, if you will,
00:05:01 is that I was reading through Sonichu issue 12.9, and in one of her backstory lines,
00:05:07 Nightstar says that her eye is green because she got some slime in it during a science experiment.
00:05:13 And suddenly my mind expanded to encompass all of not only dimension 12.18, but also C197.
00:05:21 And I realized that it was all connected in a great circle of life, and it was a story that I had to tell.
00:05:28 It very quickly becomes like, it seems like you're trying to make it a tutorial for Endless War as well.
00:05:34 Like a user book almost, like to lure in new people.
00:05:38 Like hey, because your biggest video is your Chris Chan video, so it's like, hey, Chris Chan people,
00:05:43 come look at this comic that is secretly trying to teach you how to play my underground discord video game.
00:05:49 I mean, Chris Chan is in Endless War right now. Like they entered.
00:05:54 That's true.
00:05:55 That's fucking crazy.
00:05:56 Yeah, the world, this is one of those moments where it's like, oh, our lives have gotten too fucking weird now.
00:06:02 It's so cool.
00:06:03 She's in there, she's got the special role of visiting mayor of Quickville, although technically, she is dead.
00:06:10 She is a corpse in the sewers.
00:06:12 And has her scalp.
00:06:13 No, no, Dupati Shmoopal has been messaging me.
00:06:16 Dupati Shmoopal has acquired the scalp through various trade deals and barter swapping,
00:06:23 and I guess he wants to barter with me for various objects.
00:06:28 That's the kind of thing Dup would do.
00:06:30 So it's not exactly a tutorial, it talks about, like I do bring, I do mention game mechanics every here and there,
00:06:43 just because I think it's funny, and you know, I drop links in there and stuff.
00:06:46 It is kind of, Matthew told me that people are joining because they're finding the game in the comic,
00:06:54 which is really funny, and kind of what I wanted, but also it's just sort of like a loving tribute.
00:06:59 It's just sort of a fucking...
00:07:03 Alright, I have the whole first chapter, ready to go.
00:07:06 It might be done, but I think I said this last week.
00:07:08 I'm getting close to there.
00:07:11 I just have all these key points, I have these key images in my head that I must hit,
00:07:15 and in between those, I'm just scribbling out, I have to fucking power my way through to that image that I see.
00:07:23 The next page is one.
00:07:25 I see it, I have to make it, because there's tons of artwork from Endless War, right?
00:07:33 And these locations, do they, within the context of the game, do they have accepted visuals?
00:07:40 Do people have a joined sense of what the minds look like, or have you just now defined that through this comic?
00:07:47 Is that official canon, or should people continue to interpret it differently?
00:07:51 It's both.
00:07:53 It's sort of loose, there's a loose canon.
00:07:55 If somebody draws a really cool version of, like, all of the locations have flavor text describing them,
00:08:03 but they're vague enough that you could interpret it in many ways.
00:08:06 So anything goes, but the coolest stuff is the thing people stick with.
00:08:10 Every district is a big place, so the fact that two people draw the minds differently,
00:08:17 you can just be like, oh well, okay, I mean it's a big place, you know.
00:08:20 There's two different spots, and like, this is, like, the agreed, if you draw it is canon.
00:08:26 Like, this is the understanding, this is the community, this is a collective understanding,
00:08:31 is that it's all canon, and like, you just gotta find a way to understand that it's all canon.
00:08:38 And I mean, did you, I mean, I just want to, I said this last time, but not only, yes,
00:08:42 everything that's happening here is canon, Endless War, that's how it works,
00:08:45 but the involvement of Christian, and by Christian's explicit word, has made all of this stuff,
00:08:50 all of this canon to real life.
00:08:53 It's canon to real life explicitly, and that's just right, so far as I'm concerned.
00:08:58 Just right.
00:08:59 So wait, what you mean by canon to real life is that it's canon to the Christian universe,
00:09:05 which is real life.
00:09:07 Well, yes.
00:09:09 I mean, Christian is canon.
00:09:13 Sonichu is canon, okay, well, first of all, all this is explicitly canon to Sonichu,
00:09:18 because Chris said so.
00:09:20 But on top of that, so now, this, everything adjacent to this, and Sonichu itself,
00:09:27 and Endless War, and T-Bat, and even Radcon, if you can believe it,
00:09:34 all these things are now canon to real life, in that they literally physically exist somewhere in the universe,
00:09:40 because all fiction, this included, takes place in C197.
00:09:47 So, it's all real.
00:09:49 We will go there soon, as the dimensions collide.
00:09:52 Magichan is already here.
00:09:54 Magichan has been appearing, he's been making appearances in YouTube videos lately.
00:09:58 Chris has been making tweets about, like, oh, look who showed up in one frame of such and such video,
00:10:03 too fast for the human eye to see.
00:10:05 It's Magichan.
00:10:07 Right.
00:10:09 Excellent.
00:10:11 I just want to know what it feels like to have gone from somebody who, like, a decade ago,
00:10:16 was, like, researching Chris Chan, and, like, following her output with Sonichu,
00:10:22 made a lecture that was, like, the biggest thing you've ever made,
00:10:25 and now Chris considers everything you've ever made canon to her universe.
00:10:31 It's not enough.
00:10:33 It's not enough.
00:10:35 I want more.
00:10:37 What I want, I will not be happy until...
00:10:41 I will not be happy until Chris draws...
00:10:44 Chris starts drawing comics with your characters in you?
00:10:46 Until Chris starts drawing.
00:10:48 And not in, like, a weird idea, guys, way.
00:10:50 Just in a...
00:10:52 I just want to see...
00:10:54 I want, like, a genuine back and forth.
00:10:57 Like, a genuine artistic back and forth between me and Chris.
00:11:01 And once...
00:11:03 Do you think that Chris would be bothered by any of the content in your comic?
00:11:07 I think that she was bothered by the 9-11.
00:11:10 But not...
00:11:12 Okay, Chris was not...
00:11:14 That was the funniest fucking thing in that comic, by the way.
00:11:16 That was the same thing.
00:11:18 And the gigantic explosion of blood.
00:11:20 That was awesome.
00:11:22 Chris was not bothered by the blood at all.
00:11:24 Chris was not bothered by Red Man's murder.
00:11:26 Well, I thought that you was pretty violent, right?
00:11:28 Well, okay. It was and it has been.
00:11:30 But I think that Chris has, like, really walked back on that
00:11:33 because the reception to the end of...
00:11:36 Whichever one with the Alec Benson Leary trial...
00:11:39 That one has these, like, gruesome executions.
00:11:42 But all those were made non-canonical and, like, retcon
00:11:47 so that they didn't technically happen.
00:11:49 Chris, like, fully walked back from that, right?
00:11:51 Because the negative reaction was huge.
00:11:54 So, like, Chris has learned through, like,
00:11:56 the application of one's hand to a hot stove
00:11:58 that you don't touch that anymore, right?
00:12:00 So, Chris knows on some level that, like, violence is bad.
00:12:04 And that's why I think she was like,
00:12:07 whoa, okay.
00:12:09 This 9-11 was no fun, you guys.
00:12:12 Because, like, people reacted negatively to her
00:12:14 over that one video where she makes fun of Clyde Cash
00:12:17 by saying that he is like the Twin Towers.
00:12:19 Weak.
00:12:21 Ah!
00:12:24 Oh, my God.
00:12:27 Yeah.
00:12:29 Weak like water.
00:12:31 And he could...
00:12:33 He, at the time, could blow Clyde Cash out,
00:12:36 like, birthday candles, just like the Twin Towers.
00:12:39 Right.
00:12:41 So, I think that was why Chris was like...
00:12:45 She said something about the Twin Towers about 9-11.
00:12:48 It's like, oh, good thing this didn't happen in real life.
00:12:50 This isn't the real 9-11.
00:12:52 This is a different thing.
00:12:54 This is fictional. Those buildings were empty.
00:12:56 It's got her bases covered, totally.
00:12:58 Good job.
00:13:00 But she didn't care about the fucking gruesome death of Red Man.
00:13:02 So, I don't really...
00:13:04 Red Man's fine.
00:13:06 Well, Chris doesn't know that Red Man's fine.
00:13:08 Yet.
00:13:10 This is a big reveal.
00:13:12 This is a big reveal that's coming.
00:13:14 The revive system is a big reveal
00:13:16 that's coming in the comic later.
00:13:18 Okay, that's fair.
00:13:20 So, I don't know what's going on in that head of Chris's.
00:13:22 I don't know what upsets her and what doesn't.
00:13:24 It's hard to say.
00:13:26 We'll just have to wait and see, I guess.
00:13:28 And wait for those sweet lures to be added to his comic.
00:13:30 Like, at the point when Phantom and Strawberry
00:13:32 are standing around just dripping blood,
00:13:34 just like coated in it,
00:13:36 for pages and pages and pages as they discuss
00:13:38 their situation,
00:13:40 like, at that point,
00:13:42 I thought I was over the line.
00:13:44 And, like, I was like, Chris is gonna see this
00:13:46 and be like, what the fuck is this?
00:13:48 Fuck off. But she didn't.
00:13:50 So, who knows.
00:13:52 What would you do if she got upset over something you drew
00:13:54 and wanted to sue you over the use of the carry?
00:13:56 Wanted to sue me?
00:13:58 Oh, well, I mean, she can't.
00:14:00 So, whatever.
00:14:02 Okay, drama.
00:14:04 Chris was talking to this person,
00:14:06 and this is something I didn't know about,
00:14:08 but, like, I've heard about it lately.
00:14:10 Chris was talking to someone named Sockness.
00:14:12 And this Sockness person was going to go
00:14:14 and see Chris.
00:14:16 And this person was really weird online.
00:14:18 And apparently, there were, like,
00:14:20 dating question marks, and, like,
00:14:22 Sockness got a ticket
00:14:24 and was gonna go see her.
00:14:26 And then, like, Chris called up.
00:14:28 But she called it off in, like,
00:14:30 the most lukewarm, stupid way possible,
00:14:32 where she's like, hey,
00:14:34 I still love you
00:14:36 and I want to see you,
00:14:38 but it's too soon, you know,
00:14:40 to send too many red flags,
00:14:42 at which point, message over,
00:14:44 you know, this relationship's off red flags,
00:14:46 but then it continued.
00:14:48 Actually, in reality, it continues, like,
00:14:50 oh, no, we'll do it later,
00:14:52 when there are fewer red flags, right?
00:14:54 It's like, okay, whatever you fucking need.
00:14:56 Chris has never been good at, like,
00:14:58 what's the word, cutting off when you realize
00:15:00 it's not gonna work out and making a hard decision?
00:15:02 This is, like, what's going on
00:15:04 in the Chris Chan life right now.
00:15:06 This is the drama.
00:15:08 They're not gonna fuck or whatever.
00:15:10 But, right before this happened,
00:15:12 Sockness messaged me on Twitter
00:15:14 being, like, hey, stop using
00:15:16 Sonichu shit, stop, like, doing this,
00:15:18 or we'll sue.
00:15:20 This is copyright infringement.
00:15:22 Who's we? Who are you, individual?
00:15:24 And Chris responded to Sockness, like,
00:15:26 chill out. It's fine.
00:15:28 Ah!
00:15:30 Chris is into it.
00:15:32 When you are more autistic than Chris.
00:15:34 No offense, Chris.
00:15:36 I think she's less interested in it
00:15:38 now that, um, Nightstar isn't
00:15:40 now that, like, it's not, like,
00:15:42 she's not liking every tweet anymore,
00:15:44 but, like, I'm assuming she's still seeing it.
00:15:46 You are tagging her
00:15:48 every single one.
00:15:50 I gotta bring Nightstar back,
00:15:52 like, just for, like, a little visual call.
00:15:54 I just gotta, like, test the waters,
00:15:56 make sure Chris is still paying attention,
00:15:58 trot the little image of Nightstar out
00:16:00 in front of her, like, hey, you just see,
00:16:02 you see us, it's still canon.
00:16:04 Yep. Yeah.
00:16:06 That's the easy fix. Get that.
00:16:08 Also, Chris has been,
00:16:10 those two panels of
00:16:12 Nightstar going, hmm,
00:16:14 I get it, you're lying.
00:16:16 Um, Chris has been using those
00:16:18 as, like, reaction images on Twitter.
00:16:20 Like, when someone says something
00:16:22 that Chris doesn't agree with,
00:16:24 Chris will respond with those two images.
00:16:26 Cropped very badly
00:16:28 in such a way that you literally
00:16:30 cannot see Nightstar's face in either
00:16:32 panel, but whatever.
00:16:34 The intent is there, I guess.
00:16:36 I love it.
00:16:38 Yeah, so that's, so that's,
00:16:40 that's what's up with that, I suppose.
00:16:42 Pretty fucking fun.
00:16:44 Pretty fucking fun. It's really fun.
00:16:46 Tom, what's the state of a Zoomie game right now?
00:16:48 Um, well,
00:16:50 I'm getting ready to
00:16:52 start Devtober again.
00:16:54 It's been one year since
00:16:56 the production of the game has started.
00:16:58 Yo, Tom, are you far from the mic?
00:17:00 You sound kind of quiet.
00:17:02 I didn't think you sounded that quiet.
00:17:04 Okay, that sounds better, I think.
00:17:06 Sounded okay to me.
00:17:08 Okay, well, Devtober
00:17:10 starts in two days, and that'll be a year
00:17:12 since I started working on the game.
00:17:14 So I'm gonna try and get the final public demo,
00:17:16 like, complete, feature complete.
00:17:18 Nice. Like, a level and stuff.
00:17:20 I have a couple people who are helping me now.
00:17:22 The game's come pretty far.
00:17:24 I've been updating it every couple weeks
00:17:26 for Patreon. What are people helping you with?
00:17:28 Just if you don't mind, Sharon.
00:17:30 Um, well, I have three people...
00:17:32 I have, uh,
00:17:34 Sixten and my friend, Adar, who've been doing
00:17:36 the soundtrack, and we've been going back far.
00:17:38 They've been making some new tracks. It's pretty fucking sick.
00:17:40 They got the authentic OPM
00:17:42 emulator things.
00:17:44 So it sounds authentic to Sega Genesis,
00:17:46 which is dope.
00:17:48 And then this other dude messaged me on Twitter,
00:17:50 out of the blue, was like, hey, I do 3D,
00:17:52 uh, let me help.
00:17:54 And I'm like, what can you do?
00:17:56 And then I just took one of my concept arts,
00:17:58 that I just showed him randomly,
00:18:00 and he's like, here's a fully complete model
00:18:02 in like three days. I'm like, okay,
00:18:04 sure, let's do it.
00:18:06 So, he's like,
00:18:08 super stoked about that. So I got a couple people
00:18:10 to kind of help lighten the load,
00:18:12 because there's a lot of shit that needs to get done.
00:18:14 It's, yeah, that's the way.
00:18:16 When was the last, like,
00:18:18 uh, well, no, I guess I should ask, like,
00:18:20 um,
00:18:22 when...
00:18:24 when can we,
00:18:26 the rest of us see,
00:18:28 when can the general public see,
00:18:30 like, the new build or something?
00:18:32 You got one plan?
00:18:34 I'm hoping by the, the plan right now
00:18:36 is to get the final demo,
00:18:38 that's like, basically an entire level
00:18:40 with a boss fight, by the end of December.
00:18:42 Nice. A boss fight. Okay, cool.
00:18:44 Cool, cool, cool.
00:18:46 Yeah, so I have like a boss that I've modeled,
00:18:48 I gotta figure out, like, how to...
00:18:50 Did you end up, like, finding somebody to consult with
00:18:52 not yet, that is my next thing.
00:18:54 I gotta find somebody who's, like,
00:18:56 Tom, Tom, if you want to win every indie game
00:18:58 award, here's what you do.
00:19:00 You, okay, there was, like, a thread on,
00:19:02 on Vee about this the other day, it's like, you, you,
00:19:04 you know, you know what, like, the jumping capabilities
00:19:06 of your character are, you just make
00:19:08 tunnels of spikes, and just make it
00:19:10 so that you can barely make the jumps,
00:19:12 and everything except a perfect jump is surrounded
00:19:14 with spikes, and you will win
00:19:16 every indie game award that there is
00:19:18 if you just do that, because that's what
00:19:20 the game design looks like, right?
00:19:22 No, you should base it, I think if you,
00:19:24 the more you base it on, like,
00:19:26 going back and playing,
00:19:28 like, Genesis Shinobi,
00:19:30 and just, like, try to copy the level designs
00:19:32 to some extent, because, like, if you're,
00:19:34 you know, I mean, obviously your mechanics
00:19:36 are more advanced, I think, than Shinobis are,
00:19:38 but, like, you know, if you want it
00:19:40 to feel, like, more authentic to Genesis,
00:19:42 like, you know, try to do Genesis
00:19:44 level design.
00:19:46 Yeah, I mean, that's the idea.
00:19:48 Examine that stuff. The biggest,
00:19:50 I don't want to say issue, but the
00:19:52 challenge right now is going to be that, like,
00:19:54 Izumi's movement is insane, like, you can
00:19:56 traverse, like, huge distances
00:19:58 with, like, a double jump plus a double dash,
00:20:00 so you can, like, go crazy
00:20:02 ape shit, so I might have toned that down,
00:20:04 even though it's super fucking fun, and it's the best part
00:20:06 of the entire game. I mean, you can also look
00:20:08 at stuff, like, like, Mega Man X
00:20:10 has more, like, agile movement
00:20:12 than, say, like, you know,
00:20:14 Shinobi, like, there's, like,
00:20:16 dashing and stuff like that, and
00:20:18 there's definitely some
00:20:20 games from that era that, you know,
00:20:22 that, like, you just use
00:20:24 they just, like, make the levels bigger.
00:20:26 They're just taller and more vertical, you know?
00:20:28 Yeah. There's just going to be a lot more
00:20:30 space. I mean, the funny thing is, like, I was
00:20:32 playing it, I was working on the mechanics,
00:20:34 I'm, like, getting really, like, into, like,
00:20:36 the hit stop and, like, the cathartic, like,
00:20:38 game feel. I'm like, why didn't I just make a beat
00:20:40 him up? Then I wouldn't have to worry about levels.
00:20:42 All those levels are literally just a straight line
00:20:44 approach things. That's true.
00:20:46 I would have solved, like, 90% of my power right there.
00:20:48 It's always been crazy to me, though, that beat-ups are, like,
00:20:50 we're such a big genre, because, like,
00:20:52 they aren't, like, really straightforward.
00:20:54 Yeah. I mean, they literally are
00:20:56 go left the game. I mean, those are
00:20:58 go right the game, depending on the level.
00:21:00 I think the appeal of those is just the sound effects
00:21:02 of the punching, and it's just really cathartic.
00:21:04 Exactly. And that's, like,
00:21:06 that's the thing that I'm, like, being
00:21:08 really autistic over, like, the last, like,
00:21:10 month has just been, like, I gotta make
00:21:12 maybe if I put the hit stop, like,
00:21:14 a little bit more to feel even better.
00:21:16 Maybe if I make this part not part of the hit stop,
00:21:18 so it keeps animating, even though everything else is frozen,
00:21:20 it'll feel even better. And I'm, like,
00:21:22 Great sound effects will
00:21:24 enhance, like, anything.
00:21:26 Like, if the animation is so-so,
00:21:28 if you get a perfect sound effect,
00:21:30 nobody will ever notice.
00:21:32 If it's not, like, the animation's a bit
00:21:34 roof. There was a game someone recommended
00:21:36 to me. I was watching a playthrough of it,
00:21:38 and I muted it, and instantly
00:21:40 the game didn't feel nearly as good,
00:21:42 because the sound was doing all the heavy lifting.
00:21:44 I'm like, huh, that's interesting.
00:21:46 So when I did that, I muted my game and made sure
00:21:48 it still felt good. I'm like, hey, hey, I'm better than you.
00:21:50 Oh, that's a good idea. Yeah, so...
00:21:52 It's cool.
00:21:54 I'm hype. It's gonna be, it's gonna be good.
00:21:56 Yeah, this reminds me of, back in the day,
00:21:58 me and my buddy John, I mean, in college,
00:22:00 I made a couple of games. There was a game design club,
00:22:02 study and that stuff, etc. But,
00:22:04 after college, me and my buddy John were working on
00:22:06 a game. I forget
00:22:08 and I think we gave it a name. It was something
00:22:10 musical related.
00:22:12 And the conceit of it was,
00:22:14 I was doing level design, and most of
00:22:16 the programming, I mean, whatever,
00:22:18 I was a more experienced programmer and stuff,
00:22:20 and I had done level design for a game.
00:22:22 Me and my buddy Rich had done in college,
00:22:24 so I was doing it again. That was
00:22:26 primarily a platformer, and I'll just tell everybody
00:22:28 the gimmick, because that's the most interesting
00:22:30 thing about it. And it's when you establish
00:22:32 your mechanics, then you build the levels around it.
00:22:34 That's the way to make it the game
00:22:36 that I would want to most play, because I love
00:22:38 platformers and stuff. And so,
00:22:40 here was the conceit of the game. It was
00:22:42 that every level
00:22:44 had its own music,
00:22:46 or maybe every world would have its own song
00:22:48 that plays in the background. And here was the thing.
00:22:50 On the beat, and sometimes irregularly
00:22:52 on the beat, there would be an
00:22:54 indicator that would flash. And so, on
00:22:56 beat, again, this is like a musically
00:22:58 themed game, you would get abilities
00:23:00 that you could only do basically on the
00:23:02 beat. It was kind of like a
00:23:04 R-Hero meets, I don't know, Super Meat Boy
00:23:06 or something. And so, like, just for one
00:23:08 example, you would, like, your jump
00:23:10 would go like twice as high if you jumped
00:23:12 on the beat as opposed to not on the beat.
00:23:14 It's a little bit necromancer, right?
00:23:16 Yeah, yeah, this is before necromancer.
00:23:18 But yeah, it was like that. It was like that.
00:23:20 But you would, yeah, I mean,
00:23:22 we thought it was cool. We made a couple of levels.
00:23:24 We actually made quite a few levels. But I mean,
00:23:26 this was, I made a little
00:23:28 character designs. It was cute. It was a good stuff.
00:23:30 But actually, this was the time when,
00:23:32 right at the beginning, I was spending my free time.
00:23:34 I was, you know, going to work. I was spending my free time
00:23:36 working on this game with John. But then I
00:23:38 decided to do YouTube. So I'm like, hey, John,
00:23:40 I'm going to spend my time doing YouTube instead
00:23:42 of working on this game. So, you know,
00:23:44 I won't have as much time. Maybe it just doesn't
00:23:46 work out. I'll come back. So
00:23:48 maybe one day, me and John will pick up that idea
00:23:50 and run with it again.
00:23:52 But I thought it was a good
00:23:54 idea. I love doing it. I kind of miss making
00:23:56 games because it's pretty fun. It's also
00:23:58 really, really hard. So the big problem
00:24:00 that I'm reading about now with games,
00:24:02 and that scares me immensely is
00:24:04 everyone's like indie games are over. It's
00:24:06 impossible to get noticed or make
00:24:08 any money off of them. Oh, that's fucking bullshit.
00:24:10 I don't believe that. It's crazy.
00:24:12 The entire fucking like
00:24:14 industry, not industry, but like community seems
00:24:16 like so fucking down on everything.
00:24:18 And I'm just constantly reading things about that.
00:24:20 I mean, maybe, maybe it's a pragmatic thing.
00:24:22 Like we can point to things like Hollow Knight and
00:24:24 even like Blasphemous that just came out.
00:24:26 But those, those are like, okay, how many
00:24:28 indie games were made for like two or three
00:24:30 or four or five to stand out at the peak?
00:24:32 Maybe just realistically. The big gay panic
00:24:34 in the indie scene right now
00:24:36 is that everybody is
00:24:38 doing, they're adopting
00:24:40 a Netflix subscription service now.
00:24:42 So like you only, you get,
00:24:44 you're going to get paid on this. Like Humble Bundle kind of stuff?
00:24:46 Well, the platforms
00:24:48 like, like a lot of people who do
00:24:50 indies right now are doing mobile. And
00:24:52 both Apple and Android
00:24:54 both just announced a $5 a month
00:24:56 spot, not streaming service,
00:24:58 but subscription service for games.
00:25:00 And so you're only under that model
00:25:02 you only get paid for how many minutes
00:25:04 people are playing your games. Oh my goodness.
00:25:06 So you're incentivizing like pointless endless
00:25:08 bullshit that just wasted your time.
00:25:10 Because you're just, just like
00:25:12 you know, fucking Netflix
00:25:14 fucked over like movies and, and Spotify
00:25:16 is like bankrupting the indie musicians.
00:25:18 Everyone's like, well, the subscription service
00:25:20 is coming for games now too.
00:25:22 So everyone's butt hurt about that. Feels like
00:25:24 more every day, like we're coming
00:25:26 closer to just have your own
00:25:28 website, forget stuff,
00:25:30 just be, be cool and have your own
00:25:32 shit. Tom, yeah.
00:25:34 Tom, you're planning to sell the game, right?
00:25:36 Uh, initially I wasn't,
00:25:38 but now that it's becoming such a
00:25:40 big fucking to do and it's becoming
00:25:42 a brain blast of like cool ideas that
00:25:44 have no idea how I'm going to pull off, I'm probably going to have to just
00:25:46 to justify all the effort.
00:25:48 How much do you think you charge for it?
00:25:50 I don't know, more than
00:25:52 $10. It's only going to be four levels.
00:25:54 Probably be like an hour to play through.
00:25:56 I think, I think if the game is only
00:25:58 like, you know, 10 bucks or less
00:26:00 and like we have a platform
00:26:02 to promote it, so like at the
00:26:04 very least it's going to get some sales. I mean
00:26:06 you could talk about it on I Am Games,
00:26:08 you could talk about it on here, we could
00:26:10 talk about it, everybody's probably going to want to
00:26:12 promote that shit because it's going to be a fucking
00:26:14 just like we did with Davoo's game, at least a little bit.
00:26:16 And uh, if you, if
00:26:18 the game was successful enough, do you
00:26:20 think you would try to like figure out if you
00:26:22 could like reproduce it onto
00:26:24 a Genesis cartridge?
00:26:26 I mean, I don't know if it's even like
00:26:28 technically possible, because like I don't know what the exact
00:26:30 specifications of the Genesis are.
00:26:32 I mean, I would love to have that, it would be
00:26:34 like the biggest come of all time.
00:26:36 How many people actually have a physical Genesis anyway?
00:26:38 You know, these days?
00:26:40 Well, lots of people. Everybody?
00:26:42 Yeah, maybe. There's currently like
00:26:44 it's kind of like a boutique market right now
00:26:46 to make like limited run
00:26:48 like repro cartridges of games.
00:26:50 But usually the games are
00:26:52 designed like literally around the systems
00:26:54 capabilities if they're going to do that, you know.
00:26:56 In Tom's case, it's more of just an aesthetic.
00:26:58 You know, what would be interesting, there's
00:27:00 there's a, there's a video
00:27:02 on um, on YouTube
00:27:04 of some guy that
00:27:06 it was just, it was called Doom running on an NES.
00:27:08 And I guess
00:27:10 what he did is you just have a, you have
00:27:12 you open up a NES cartridge,
00:27:14 you put a Raspberry Pi in there, and then
00:27:16 you can have it output through
00:27:18 the NES, but it just runs the game off the
00:27:20 Raspberry Pi.
00:27:22 Yeah, Raspberry Pi is like a mini computer.
00:27:24 Why would you put a Pi in your fucking Nintendo?
00:27:26 That sounds pretty messy.
00:27:28 What were they thinking?
00:27:32 Oh, it was a parody video, no one told me
00:27:34 shit. I thought this was...
00:27:36 But like, I'm just thinking like maybe you could do that for a Sega,
00:27:38 like you get like a Raspberry Pi, it runs
00:27:40 the game off that, but it like interfaces
00:27:42 through the Genesis's video out.
00:27:44 For a Genesis, you would use a chili dough.
00:27:46 Apparently it is possible.
00:27:48 What's up? I, I, I don't know
00:27:50 anything about this. I've only heard that like indie
00:27:52 people say that like getting your
00:27:54 uh, game on Nintendo is pretty, is pretty good.
00:27:56 Uh, would it that... Yeah, the switch
00:27:58 is pretty fucking hot right now for
00:28:00 indies, but even, even now it's like starting
00:28:02 to get super saturated, just because everyone's
00:28:04 targeting that. Cause there's way too much fucking bullshit.
00:28:06 Like they are not quality controlling it.
00:28:08 So you go on there and just like switch the
00:28:10 new Steam.
00:28:12 It's, it kinda is, yeah.
00:28:14 Steam's kind of, I guess, I was reading
00:28:16 today in a thread that I guess Steam's reduced
00:28:18 like profits for indies by 50%
00:28:20 or something, like some update to the policy
00:28:22 and everyone's fucking butt heard about it
00:28:24 and I'm just like, I don't even know what's going on.
00:28:26 I'm just over here in my corner, coloring.
00:28:28 So,
00:28:30 I have no fucking clue. It's very strange.
00:28:32 I can't, I can't believe, I really can't believe
00:28:34 that like indies are getting released on the switch.
00:28:36 That seems like, that's like the
00:28:38 opposite of like Nintendo's old
00:28:40 Goose game. Oh, someone was telling me
00:28:42 about Goose game just yesterday.
00:28:44 My friend, yeah, my friend
00:28:46 Toby was telling me that I got
00:28:48 to check out Goose game. My friend Toby
00:28:50 Fox. My friend, yes, yeah.
00:28:52 He was like, hey, Ben, love the
00:28:54 Nightstar comic. Just back the
00:28:56 Vapors 2 Kickstarter
00:28:58 at kickstarter.com
00:28:59 slash project slash
00:29:00 Ben St. Slash Vapors 2.
00:29:02 Love your, love your stuff. However,
00:29:04 have you played Goose
00:29:06 game? And I said, I'm titled
00:29:08 and I said, Toby Fox, you're a fucking
00:29:10 hack. Deltarune wasn't that good.
00:29:12 Come back
00:29:14 when you've fucking grown a brain, a dick
00:29:16 and a heart and
00:29:18 um
00:29:20 Has anyone actually, I mean
00:29:22 I've seen a little bit of the footage of Goose
00:29:24 game. It's just Goat Simulator 2, right?
00:29:26 I mean, who cares? That's what I said.
00:29:28 I don't know about it. I know
00:29:30 people love it. I mean
00:29:32 it's at least visually appealing
00:29:34 and Goat Simulator was not. I love it so much.
00:29:36 I agree. It's true.
00:29:38 Have you seen the Goose Waddle? That's all I need.
00:29:40 Oh my god. See, that's what people are paying
00:29:42 for. Lol, cute Goose Waddle.
00:29:44 Wow, that's worth my $1,000.
00:29:46 I'm here for this Goose.
00:29:48 I stan Goose.
00:29:50 I mean, that's all you need, I guess.
00:29:52 I'm thinking this whole video game thing.
00:29:54 Did you watch
00:29:56 Dunke's video about Goose game?
00:29:58 I did not. I did not.
00:30:00 You'll see that like, there's a lot of
00:30:02 it's like the AI scripting
00:30:04 of the people that makes the game
00:30:06 interesting. You can like really fuck with the NPCs
00:30:08 and like do weird things.
00:30:10 You can lock the little boy into a like
00:30:12 what's it called? The phone booth.
00:30:14 You can no clip through the little boy
00:30:16 and
00:30:18 QPU over a couple dimensions.
00:30:20 Oh, can you backwards long jump as the Goose?
00:30:22 You gotta keep your Goose QPU
00:30:24 aligned at all times.
00:30:26 That's the meta.
00:30:28 I want to see, I want to hear
00:30:30 like the Mario wahoo, but like a Goose
00:30:32 like honk.
00:30:38 Uh oh, it's secret Waluigi propaganda.
00:30:42 Imagine if Goose makes it into Smash
00:30:44 and Waluigi still isn't.
00:30:46 This game looks like
00:30:48 this game looks like a
00:30:50 like a Kurzgesagt video or something.
00:30:52 This game looks like
00:30:54 a like mass appeal
00:30:56 YouTube video.
00:30:58 It reminded me a bit of Ooblets
00:31:00 that you guys know about Ooblets.
00:31:02 I know the name, but I've never met the man.
00:31:04 I've heard of Ooblets. I've seen a bit of it.
00:31:06 They're the ones who got in trouble
00:31:08 for being on Epic Game Store, right?
00:31:10 Yeah, yeah. I've actually
00:31:12 knew about them way before.
00:31:14 I was looking forward to their game
00:31:16 on Steam.
00:31:18 So what's the deal? Did they get fucked?
00:31:20 They signed an
00:31:22 deal with the Epic Game Store
00:31:24 that they were like really...
00:31:26 That wasn't a big mistake.
00:31:28 They were up their own ass about it.
00:31:30 They made a whole thing just like,
00:31:32 you guys are gay. This is fucking great.
00:31:34 We're better than you because we made a game
00:31:36 and everyone was like, go fuck yourself.
00:31:38 Yeah, they were kind of rude about it.
00:31:40 If they had just been like, hey guys,
00:31:42 we're going to Epic Exclusive because
00:31:44 we really need the funding, whatever.
00:31:46 If they were honest about it
00:31:48 and just nice people.
00:31:50 When I see people arguing about the Epic Store,
00:31:52 like the argument
00:31:54 that I see online
00:31:56 is like, people are like, guys,
00:31:58 indie devs have to go
00:32:00 on the Epic Store because it makes them money
00:32:02 because they need money.
00:32:04 Duh, you idiots. And the response is
00:32:06 like, well,
00:32:08 fine, yeah, business is going to make
00:32:10 money, of course.
00:32:12 The thing people say is like,
00:32:14 yeah, but a lot of people
00:32:16 kickstarted their project, crowdfunded their project
00:32:18 or something for a public release
00:32:20 and then turned around
00:32:22 and released on an exclusive platform.
00:32:24 You bought, you backed the project
00:32:26 to get a Steam key and then like, oh, there's no Steam keys now.
00:32:28 Double-dipping, as it were.
00:32:30 Right, right.
00:32:32 I believe that Bloodstain, for example,
00:32:34 was originally supposed to be on Wii U,
00:32:36 but now, it's been so many years or whatever,
00:32:38 like, no one's, like, what's the point?
00:32:40 No one's gonna buy it. So they just ditched,
00:32:42 and I mean, it's fair to have a grievance
00:32:44 if you want it on the Wii U, but...
00:32:46 I mean, if you had a Wii U,
00:32:48 you probably have a Switch by now.
00:32:50 I feel like it would probably not be
00:32:52 here. You don't want to be changing your ways.
00:32:54 I mean, I was the oldest codger of them all
00:32:56 and I don't even have a Switch by now.
00:32:58 That's true. If you finally moved,
00:33:00 whatever, people are entitled to their grievances.
00:33:02 If people break their word, fair enough.
00:33:04 Patreon.com
00:33:06 slash PolyStation2 to play my game.
00:33:08 Play the new build. You can play
00:33:10 all the new moves I've added. It's pretty sick.
00:33:12 The hit stop is now
00:33:14 perfect, feels like the best
00:33:16 shit of all time.
00:33:18 Yeah, I'm really happy with it so far.
00:33:20 Hey, let me give you guys an update from the
00:33:22 Nate Overse, which is this thing.
00:33:24 So, me and Gib talked about this yesterday
00:33:26 when we recorded the Pawnee cast.
00:33:28 Was that yesterday? Yeah, okay, I think it was.
00:33:30 And there's a couple things going on,
00:33:32 but I've noticed a few things.
00:33:34 It's the subject of hype culture and hype stuff
00:33:36 that I talk about sometimes, but I just wanted
00:33:38 to bring up this one, particularly,
00:33:40 I don't know, a perfect example of what's going on.
00:33:42 And there was even a new one a little bit after
00:33:44 I saw that from yesterday that's even more
00:33:46 interesting. And so, the
00:33:48 new chapter of One Piece, I won't get into the specifics,
00:33:50 but among other things,
00:33:52 the new chapter had a big
00:33:54 flashback to some of Roger's
00:33:56 history, like Roger's greatest
00:33:58 rival of the past, and we learned about
00:34:00 a lot of deep lore about him and Garp
00:34:02 and things like this, and
00:34:04 the relationship of the Yonkos back in
00:34:06 the day, like the big, important people in One Piece, blah, blah, blah.
00:34:08 I know a lot of people don't know, that's fine.
00:34:10 And then the second
00:34:12 half of the chapter, what it did was it just dumped
00:34:14 all the Yonkos
00:34:16 bounties, which are like the
00:34:18 they're like the One Piece equivalent of like the power level
00:34:20 rating, it's different. People decide that it's not exactly
00:34:22 the same as like Rayatsu from Bleach or whatever,
00:34:24 but you know, there's a similar kind of hype
00:34:26 surrounding them, and we got them for
00:34:28 all the Yonko, Whitebeard,
00:34:30 and Goldfucking Roger. We got
00:34:32 like all their historical bounties that are
00:34:34 like said to be the highest of all time.
00:34:36 So like this, this is a chapter that gave
00:34:38 us numbers that don't really
00:34:40 indicate anything other than like
00:34:42 how much value like the Marines put on these guys,
00:34:44 and then we learned like some back
00:34:46 story that like, I mean
00:34:48 just thinking about it rationally, like Oda
00:34:50 could have just made this up like yesterday
00:34:52 and read it into the story as like something
00:34:54 he's planning for the future. It's not like this
00:34:56 was something that was really planned out for a long time
00:34:58 necessarily.
00:35:00 And I think given my experience with this series,
00:35:02 I think this would have been hinted if he was going to do it before.
00:35:04 Okay, but the point is
00:35:06 everything in this last chapter was like
00:35:08 pure hype bait.
00:35:10 It's like, okay, there will be future developments
00:35:12 about like Roger's past. Okay, cool.
00:35:14 And like his old
00:35:16 adversary, this guy rocks, etc. etc.
00:35:18 his old crew. And then also we just learned
00:35:20 a bunch of bounty stuff, and that stuff really
00:35:22 doesn't actually matter very much
00:35:24 to the narrative of One Piece. It's just
00:35:26 like satisfying for like us
00:35:28 like lore fags. People who are like
00:35:30 we want to know these numbers. It just
00:35:32 satisfies the autism.
00:35:34 And some people were saying this
00:35:36 was the best chapter of One Piece.
00:35:38 And I went on, I mean
00:35:40 some people who are like respected members of the
00:35:42 quote unquote One Piece community.
00:35:44 And I just found that so strange
00:35:46 that like as opposed to like
00:35:48 I hope you're not gonna go on, yeah, don't do the entire
00:35:50 rent again, it was really wrong. No, I'm not.
00:35:52 I'm just saying as opposed to like
00:35:54 a big end of arc moment where like
00:35:56 all this artistic stuff
00:35:58 that's been set up for like months and possibly years
00:36:00 all is like satisfyingly
00:36:02 concluded in an artistic
00:36:04 climax. Instead
00:36:06 this like hype chapter is called
00:36:08 like the best moment in One Piece. And I
00:36:10 find that like the wrong way
00:36:12 to read One Piece basically.
00:36:14 So it's hype culture at work. And then
00:36:16 just yesterday after I saw that
00:36:18 somebody tweeted me on Twitter
00:36:20 and they said, hey Nate, have you seen this?
00:36:22 This is what they led
00:36:24 with like Nate, did you hear about
00:36:26 the Sekiro DLC rumors?
00:36:28 Have you heard about the hints about Sekiro
00:36:30 DLC? Okay, so first of all
00:36:32 there's no one on the planet who's more
00:36:34 interested in Sekiro DLC than me.
00:36:36 I am the number one most
00:36:38 strongest Japanese boy
00:36:40 who wants my strongest Japanese DLC
00:36:42 for my samurai game.
00:36:44 This is what I want more than anything. So
00:36:46 when I actually, I'm like, okay, don't lie to me now.
00:36:48 Don't tease me boy. What is this?
00:36:50 He links me a
00:36:52 post from here. I'll fuck, I've got it right here.
00:36:54 It's a post on Sekiro's
00:36:56 Twitter that it just looks like
00:36:58 this and it says
00:37:00 the one armed wolf awakens
00:37:02 and it's just a picture of Sekiro
00:37:04 of Wolf, like from the
00:37:06 opening area of the game.
00:37:08 So people are taking this like statement
00:37:10 of the one armed wolf awakens
00:37:12 as like, ooh, could this be like a reawakening?
00:37:14 Could this be like more DLC?
00:37:16 Well, okay lads, let's use a little
00:37:18 critical thinking here. First of all
00:37:20 if you scroll down beyond like
00:37:22 two fucking posts, you can
00:37:24 see that this Twitter feed
00:37:26 regularly, it is the official Sekiro Twitter feed
00:37:28 it regularly posts
00:37:30 like still images of the game
00:37:32 with quotes exactly like this.
00:37:34 There's one from a couple days ago that's Kuro
00:37:36 the little boy that you work for, your lord
00:37:38 or whatever and it's just him and it says
00:37:40 I heard stories of your death, yet here you are
00:37:42 and there's more just like
00:37:44 the point being, like this
00:37:46 image is such a
00:37:48 poor indicator that there is actually
00:37:50 any intention of DLC, there has
00:37:52 been no other like
00:37:54 clues that any DLC is coming
00:37:56 and yet when you just look at the numbers
00:37:58 this image has been retweeted
00:38:00 4,000 times and all these other
00:38:02 ones have been retweeted like
00:38:04 100, maybe 200, like
00:38:06 150 and like there's like 10
00:38:08 times the amount of likes because people
00:38:10 have been like tricked into
00:38:12 thinking that this is like a hint of DLC
00:38:14 when there's like nothing implied
00:38:16 here and this is my point
00:38:18 this is the vicious hype machine
00:38:20 at work. I don't want to be
00:38:22 led to believe there's actually hints
00:38:24 of DLC coming when the actual
00:38:26 evidence when you do and you look at it
00:38:28 critically there's just no reason to believe
00:38:30 that and it just sets people up
00:38:32 like me in this case for
00:38:34 disappointment. So it's just
00:38:36 endlessly frustrating to me
00:38:38 that all these people involved, like I feel like
00:38:40 people say to me on the episode yesterday
00:38:42 they said like Nate we just want to get hyped
00:38:44 and excited about things, why you poo poo
00:38:46 in our hype and it's like well like
00:38:48 because it's disappointing
00:38:50 and people like if I bought Securo
00:38:52 now under the expectation that
00:38:54 DLC was coming that could be a waste of money
00:38:56 if like that's what I'm buying it for
00:38:58 customers and consumers can be
00:39:00 falsely led down paths. What if I read
00:39:02 all of One Piece because I believe
00:39:04 something that was wrong and then I get to it
00:39:06 and I'm like oh well shit that isn't what I expected
00:39:08 my time was wasted. I mean I
00:39:10 love One Piece but you get my point
00:39:12 I'm endlessly frustrated
00:39:14 by how people view this subject
00:39:16 and they just don't want to believe
00:39:18 that there could be any negative consequences
00:39:20 of any kind by like believing
00:39:22 things that have no substantiating
00:39:24 evidence by overhyping
00:39:26 things and possibly poisoning the well for
00:39:28 other people. You know
00:39:30 what I'm saying Lads, does this make sense
00:39:32 are you with me?
00:39:34 It could be fun like you know it's
00:39:36 actually coming and like and you
00:39:38 and your friends are like yeah it's
00:39:40 going to release this day let's get hyped
00:39:42 it's going to be fun and it's sort of fun
00:39:44 in the moment just to share the information
00:39:46 excitement with someone but also
00:39:48 like the hype itself if
00:39:50 you don't know if it's confirmed or not
00:39:52 or just like if you get like
00:39:54 toxic about it or violent about it
00:39:56 it's just or aggressive
00:39:58 I guess. Yeah that's true
00:40:00 or even just set up for disappointment
00:40:02 that's the great bugbear here
00:40:04 I don't want people to be disappointed by
00:40:06 things because I feel and it can
00:40:08 mislead consumers and money could be
00:40:10 spent places where it doesn't deserve or
00:40:12 time or energy I just want to save
00:40:14 people from that and myself
00:40:16 so I don't know. I feel this
00:40:18 reminds me of a situation like it pops up
00:40:20 every few years I keep seeing it
00:40:22 it used to be on Tumblr but I don't use Tumblr anymore
00:40:24 so I haven't seen it in a while
00:40:26 every few years season 2
00:40:28 of Oran High School House Club
00:40:30 is going to be announced soon
00:40:32 and everyone gets so hyped
00:40:34 and just like guys no
00:40:36 that will not happen
00:40:38 they keep promising the reboot
00:40:40 of reboot you know that old CG show
00:40:42 reboot
00:40:44 every now and then they'll announce it
00:40:46 as a way to like generate fake hype
00:40:48 but they never do it
00:40:50 if you look down at the evidence behind
00:40:52 any of these claims I would bet almost 100%
00:40:54 the actual evidence for it is like terrible
00:40:56 you know what this your stance reminds me of
00:40:58 is when the new generation
00:41:00 of consoles started
00:41:02 Super Bunny Hop had a series of videos
00:41:04 that were kind of what like first
00:41:06 drew attention to his channel
00:41:08 where he was pointing out that he just
00:41:10 was not hyped for the upcoming consoles
00:41:12 and he had first it was like
00:41:14 the Xbox one why I'm not
00:41:16 hyped which nobody was
00:41:18 so like it was just kind of seen as part for the course
00:41:20 but then he put out a video where he was
00:41:22 why he was not hyped for the PS4
00:41:24 and his argument was basically the same
00:41:26 as yours it's like a lot of the claims
00:41:28 they're making they have no evidence for
00:41:30 and in the PS3's case
00:41:32 what they tried to bill it as was not what we got
00:41:34 you know so like
00:41:36 we look like villains when we are just
00:41:38 when we poo poo and people want to be hyped
00:41:40 he got overwhelming dislikes on that
00:41:42 like even though it got enough views
00:41:44 that people paid attention to his channel from then on
00:41:46 like it's like 40%
00:41:48 dislike bar maybe even more maybe it's
00:41:50 more than 50 I have no idea how it evolved
00:41:52 over time but like people were just really
00:41:54 upset that like just the
00:41:56 PS4 literally on that
00:41:58 E3 just because it was presented
00:42:00 so much better than Xbox one is
00:42:02 considered to be why it is so
00:42:04 successful and it's like one of the most successful
00:42:06 consoles of all time after the
00:42:08 PS3 had been didn't even
00:42:10 sell half as much you know with a long
00:42:12 lifespan and weigh the fuck more games
00:42:14 I just found the video
00:42:16 5 reasons to not get hyped for the PS4
00:42:18 13,000 upvotes
00:42:20 17,000 downvotes the
00:42:22 the case is clear
00:42:24 and like he's not being unreasonable and like
00:42:26 shitting on it he's just like hey man
00:42:28 don't take the claim seriously until they've been
00:42:30 proven and like some of this
00:42:32 shit is they're talking out of their
00:42:34 ass you know like yeah it ended up
00:42:36 being a good console anyways it's just like
00:42:38 don't buy into the marketing just
00:42:40 wait till it comes out and if it's good
00:42:42 then great you know like modern day
00:42:44 triple A games a lot you know they promise
00:42:46 a lot you pre-order
00:42:48 and then like it's shit
00:42:50 you know I'm
00:42:52 working on
00:42:54 here and there I'm working on a concept that I'm
00:42:56 going to reveal at some point
00:42:58 in the future it's like a think piece
00:43:00 I've been wanting to talk about for many years
00:43:02 like my whole gaming career has been leading up
00:43:04 to it it's like it's like I think I've
00:43:06 mentioned a little bit it's something like
00:43:08 the intellectual limit on like
00:43:10 what a game or any kind of product
00:43:12 can be it like when I like for example
00:43:14 with someone like Final Fantasy 15
00:43:16 when I see people being like this game looks
00:43:18 so incredible like look at all the things
00:43:20 look how like complicated the animations
00:43:22 are I already know
00:43:24 that the developers first of all
00:43:26 technical limitations on how much you can do with
00:43:28 a controller and how much brain power
00:43:30 the average player can be expected
00:43:32 to commit to any given game 100%
00:43:34 tell me you are not controlling
00:43:36 the precise movements of these characters
00:43:38 it's mostly AI stuff happening
00:43:40 and then also I know for a fact
00:43:42 there's only so much work a dev team
00:43:44 can pour into any given game
00:43:46 to make it like feasible to release
00:43:48 I just know for a fact
00:43:50 that like Kojima levels of detail
00:43:52 are like an incredible rarity
00:43:54 we like never get that much detail
00:43:56 as like a Metal Gear Solid 3 environment or whatever
00:43:58 so like it's it's silly
00:44:00 to just allow the hype machine to be like
00:44:02 it's going to be like No Man's Sky
00:44:04 generation stuff almost every single time
00:44:06 and people just allow their imaginations
00:44:08 to run wild and they inevitably
00:44:10 set up for disappointment
00:44:12 I think that the culture has
00:44:14 somewhat shifted after like
00:44:16 Watch Dogs because so many people
00:44:18 that and the one you just said
00:44:20 and also like No Man's Sky
00:44:22 the non-release of like Star Citizen
00:44:24 over the course of all these years
00:44:26 you know or Spore
00:44:28 it's just like all these games that over promise
00:44:30 and then like but particularly
00:44:32 like Watch Dogs where it like didn't even resemble
00:44:34 the original thing it's like
00:44:36 it's just a generic shitty game
00:44:38 and everybody was like buying fucking
00:44:40 special editions of it because what they
00:44:42 showed in the trailers
00:44:44 looked awesome but like
00:44:46 it was like a technical benchmark
00:44:48 but they didn't achieve that in the game
00:44:50 this has been going on forever
00:44:52 I mean the Killzone 2 trailer
00:44:54 from fucking all the way back
00:44:56 the Dark Souls 2 trailer
00:44:58 fuck
00:45:00 the entire Anthem reveal
00:45:02 haha yeah exactly
00:45:04 like did you guys hear about
00:45:06 Anthem how like
00:45:08 they had this huge big reveal and it looked
00:45:10 gorgeous and everything and then later it came out
00:45:12 it's like yeah the entire dev team
00:45:14 working on Anthem found out the game was called
00:45:16 Anthem on that reveal trailer
00:45:18 that's how like far behind in development they were
00:45:20 and it's just like
00:45:22 oh dear
00:45:24 I mean one facet of this
00:45:26 this isn't I mean this isn't directly
00:45:28 into the subject but like your video recently on
00:45:30 Digi or Digi's video about
00:45:32 the new remake of Link's Awakening
00:45:34 or whatever like that
00:45:36 you know this is a little bit different but it's like
00:45:38 it's like what's the selling point
00:45:40 of that game yes apparently
00:45:42 some things have been improved in like the gameplay
00:45:44 but like why
00:45:46 a lot of it matters just what are you looking
00:45:48 for out of the game if you just want
00:45:50 a game that looks like that and you want to experience
00:45:52 then I have nothing critical
00:45:54 to say basically that's that it is
00:45:56 what it is there's no doubt no point
00:45:58 doubting it it's weird we've entered
00:46:00 a period now where like
00:46:02 we people have gotten used
00:46:04 to buying the same game multiple times
00:46:06 on different consoles like whichever
00:46:08 console you have hooked up to your TV because
00:46:10 of the fact that we use our consoles for fucking
00:46:12 everything like my brother
00:46:14 Victor he does all of his
00:46:16 YouTube viewing everything
00:46:18 internet browsing usually just because he's too lazy
00:46:20 to open a laptop all through the
00:46:22 ps4 so it's like
00:46:24 just you know
00:46:26 Jesse is somebody Jesse and
00:46:28 Tom I know are both people who bought the same game
00:46:30 multiple times
00:46:32 like you bought doom on the switch even though
00:46:34 you already had it on PC
00:46:36 like to be fair I bought doom on the switch
00:46:38 I thought I was going to be living in a car and I wouldn't
00:46:40 be able to fare on a ps4 anymore
00:46:42 okay fair enough but like
00:46:44 you know still buy it
00:46:46 will buy it on the on the sake of like oh
00:46:48 I want to have it on the switch
00:46:50 and like a lot of people had links
00:46:52 I did that with Hollow Knight I straight up just
00:46:54 bought it on the switch I wanted on it
00:46:56 I bought guilty gear double X like at least seven times
00:46:58 I also did them with forager so yeah
00:47:00 yeah there you go
00:47:02 I'm not going to get ruined factory 4 on the switch
00:47:04 even though I have it on the 3DS
00:47:06 I had bought links Awakening DX
00:47:08 on the 3DS and played it for the first time
00:47:10 there in the virtual console
00:47:12 and like because switch doesn't have virtual
00:47:14 console yet I think they were just like
00:47:16 alright well we've been remaking Zelda games
00:47:18 which one hasn't had a remake and it's like
00:47:20 Link's Awakening had a remake but it was still on the
00:47:22 Game Boy we could a lot of people
00:47:24 like it let's just update it
00:47:26 with better graphics and sell it for
00:47:28 60 fucking dollars and people will pay for
00:47:30 it because it's got the Legend of Zelda in the name and like
00:47:32 to me it's like it's obscene
00:47:34 but I almost bought it anyway you know
00:47:36 I was just kind of like well I'll play it
00:47:38 I know I was really tempted
00:47:40 I'm still kind of tempted to buy it
00:47:42 but I think I really do want to just play
00:47:44 the original more and it was absolutely your
00:47:46 if you haven't played the original I would encourage
00:47:48 you to because it's fun it's a fun
00:47:50 game like it holds up
00:47:52 it's you could pick up and play it
00:47:54 the only thing that's frustrating about it
00:47:56 is that you can only hold two items at a
00:47:58 time and the sword is one of the items so you
00:48:00 almost always want your sword equipped so
00:48:02 every time you want to switch items you have to open up the menu
00:48:04 and you will do it a lot
00:48:06 the number one only thing that's really not
00:48:08 good about the game everything else is good
00:48:10 so that game
00:48:12 Link's Awakening an Oracle of Ages
00:48:14 and Seasons I couldn't get into them because
00:48:16 all of the micromanaging of your inventory
00:48:18 I beat all of those though that was annoying
00:48:20 it was definitely annoying
00:48:22 they did somewhat
00:48:24 like they mostly fixed it because they gave
00:48:26 you an assigned sword button
00:48:28 and an assigned shield button and I think
00:48:30 the gauntlets are just permanently on so it's
00:48:32 like you don't have to do it as much
00:48:34 but there still were ways they could have
00:48:36 made it even better like they could have
00:48:38 given you like a weapon wheel or something that you
00:48:40 could just instantly switch between because
00:48:42 it's not that there's a ton of them but there are a
00:48:44 few that you need to use a lot
00:48:46 so it's just like why make it so I have to go
00:48:48 into the menu at all
00:48:50 but you know this is the thing this was funny
00:48:52 I was like trying to get answers about this
00:48:54 I tweeted out I mean I don't know I've been doing this a bunch lately
00:48:56 I'll just say it like I was thinking about doing
00:48:58 this with Code Vein
00:49:00 Code Vein has been discussed on V for a million years
00:49:02 like the waifu creation people are going
00:49:04 hog wild about it but like
00:49:06 I'm just like okay I could maybe enjoy
00:49:08 the waifu playing as and the creation
00:49:10 and jacking off to IO like your waifu
00:49:12 in the game whatever I could do that for like
00:49:14 I don't know maybe even up to an hour
00:49:16 but once I'm done with that
00:49:18 I'm gonna want to actually play the game
00:49:20 it's apparently Dark Souls-esque so like
00:49:22 I didn't do this yet but I've been doing it with other games
00:49:24 I want to tweet like so guys is this game actually good
00:49:26 I think it is
00:49:28 I believe it is but I'm not
00:49:30 100% sure I know it was just a development for a million years
00:49:32 I mean people fucking love Monster Hunter so
00:49:34 I never got into it I still need to
00:49:36 it's the one from the
00:49:38 big difference it's the one from the God
00:49:40 Eater people yes okay it is
00:49:42 like just like that one yeah
00:49:44 but they're copying they're trying to know it's
00:49:46 it's from the God Eater people but I think it's like
00:49:48 more of a Monster Hunter type of game
00:49:50 because I read an article about it in like a game informer
00:49:52 or something before it came out
00:49:54 well I mean the way that ties into this the Zelda thing
00:49:56 is like so I actually did do this with Zelda
00:49:58 I just tweeted like guys like you know
00:50:00 me I mean this was like mostly
00:50:02 I'm a nostalgia blinded old fuck boy
00:50:04 and I hate everything that's new
00:50:06 but like just tell me like
00:50:08 I want to play a game for the gameplay the aesthetic
00:50:10 will only last for like a little bit then I'll get
00:50:12 tired of it because that's how I play games I want
00:50:14 good gameplay will I enjoy
00:50:16 the new Zelda remake it's considering
00:50:18 that I've like loved every classic Zelda I played
00:50:20 when I was young and I'm okay with that
00:50:22 kind of game remake which game
00:50:24 Link's Awakening was
00:50:26 that was on the original on the Game Boy
00:50:28 that's correct
00:50:30 did I ask the same question last week
00:50:32 no but we did just
00:50:34 cover this right now sorry I was
00:50:36 trading I was completing the trade the trade
00:50:38 is done I've given Master Slimal into Dupati
00:50:40 Smuple and I am Schmuple and I am now
00:50:42 in possession of visiting mayor
00:50:44 Christine Weston Chandler's scalp
00:50:46 in Endless War congratulations in my
00:50:48 pocket just had to announce it
00:50:50 I'm very excited anyway
00:50:52 mm-hmm what the fuck
00:50:54 were we talking about
00:50:56 Zelda will I actually like the Zelda gameplay
00:50:58 I think that you would definitely
00:51:00 prefer to just emulate
00:51:02 the old game like
00:51:04 if you I mean I don't it's free first of
00:51:06 all that's a big plus right there
00:51:08 the fucking game is $60
00:51:10 it's only five hours
00:51:12 long if you play it fast like
00:51:14 it's not a they didn't
00:51:16 change anything about it it's the same
00:51:18 fucking game they just change your
00:51:20 controls so it's like this is a Game Boy
00:51:22 game I can like I bought
00:51:24 it on the 3ds it was like eight
00:51:26 bucks maybe ten you know
00:51:28 like I was willing to pay that for the
00:51:30 ease of playing it on my 3ds
00:51:32 because I wanted to play it there I had been playing
00:51:34 a lot of 3ds but like
00:51:36 yeah I play a lot of switch but fucking
00:51:38 $60 I can literally just
00:51:40 download this game and play it on
00:51:42 any computer in the fucking house and it's not that
00:51:44 long that's how I played all the other classic
00:51:46 Zelda games it's not like there's a fucking
00:51:48 collection pack where I can just buy all
00:51:50 of these in one thing like you can do with
00:51:52 Mega Man or Sonic or the entire
00:51:54 fucking Sega Genesis library
00:51:56 like how fucking hard
00:51:58 is it for them to just put together
00:52:00 a pack of all the classic Zelda games
00:52:02 Nintendo knows they don't have to
00:52:04 because they can tell us $60
00:52:06 reskills they're the apple of gaming
00:52:08 they can go against before
00:52:10 before we go even further down
00:52:12 and like I wanted to talk about hype
00:52:14 for a bit if we're still on that
00:52:16 okay the
00:52:18 the whole thing with like hype I mean in video
00:52:20 games specifically I don't feel it because
00:52:22 I'm extremely cynical like the last
00:52:24 time I was hyped good for
00:52:26 any video game was
00:52:28 Dark Souls 3 and since then
00:52:30 I haven't really cared about anything that's
00:52:32 come out
00:52:34 do you feel any hype
00:52:36 at all for the promise of the next
00:52:38 Hida Takamiya Zaki game
00:52:40 the one that's being
00:52:42 written by the Game of Thrones guy
00:52:44 I mean yes and no
00:52:46 when's the next fucking book when's
00:52:48 wins of winter George
00:52:50 I don't know give it a couple years
00:52:52 it's been like a fucking decade
00:52:54 George is gonna drop dead and we're all gonna
00:52:56 die along with it
00:52:58 Elden Ring is
00:53:00 wait that's it
00:53:02 George George
00:53:04 he's known for killing characters
00:53:06 his final act is tragically killing
00:53:08 the ultimate character himself
00:53:10 before the books are done
00:53:12 the ultimate twist he's gonna die
00:53:14 at the ledger
00:53:18 anyway he's gonna die at the ledge of a fucking
00:53:20 cliff
00:53:22 usually with games
00:53:24 I'm not like I don't get hype
00:53:26 for media in general I don't get hype
00:53:28 but I do effect
00:53:30 I do get the hype thing
00:53:32 in other areas and I have
00:53:34 I've experienced
00:53:36 the unbelievable
00:53:38 anger that comes from somebody quashing
00:53:40 my hype
00:53:42 which is why I understand
00:53:44 the people who get upset about it
00:53:46 is because
00:53:48 I forget exactly what the situation was
00:53:50 but I was like trying to figure out
00:53:52 some things with learning to draw
00:53:54 art
00:53:56 stuff
00:53:58 just techniques
00:54:00 or approaches that are good or bad
00:54:02 or whatever
00:54:04 I was thinking I had something pretty good
00:54:06 and I was like talking about it
00:54:08 and then somebody comes in
00:54:10 actually I don't think I was talking about it
00:54:12 but I was reading people's things
00:54:14 I was like yeah this sounds really good
00:54:16 and then the people come in and say
00:54:18 by the way all of that stuff was
00:54:20 really stupid and
00:54:22 here's some examples of better artists
00:54:24 who are explaining why that isn't true
00:54:26 and it was like it destroyed me
00:54:28 and I got really mad but I didn't say anything
00:54:30 because I was just like
00:54:32 they're right they have the proof
00:54:34 and
00:54:36 the anger was like
00:54:38 this thing is provably stupid
00:54:42 in whatever way I forget exactly
00:54:44 but the thing that
00:54:46 the feeling was is that I had hope
00:54:48 you know I had hope for this thing
00:54:50 I was invested in this
00:54:52 approach and I realized
00:54:54 that oh yeah this doesn't make sense
00:54:56 and it's stupid and this guy came
00:54:58 you know he's destroyed
00:55:00 my hope and I feel like
00:55:02 a lot of the reason people get hype for things
00:55:04 is that they really want to be hopeful about something
00:55:06 and any negativity
00:55:08 that gets in their way is just like
00:55:10 how fucking dare you I have enough to deal with
00:55:12 without you making video games
00:55:14 upsetting for me god damn
00:55:16 people think that video games aren't
00:55:18 serious enough business to like
00:55:20 worry about this stuff with which I understand
00:55:22 to a degree it's 2019
00:55:24 the planet is dying
00:55:26 I just want to get hype for fucking
00:55:28 what's that condemned
00:55:30 what was the one with the cone head man
00:55:32 a blasphemous
00:55:34 I just want to be hyped for blasphemous and then you
00:55:36 come in and tell me that the art is good
00:55:38 but the gameplay is mediocre get the fuck
00:55:40 out of here what am I supposed to live for
00:55:42 yeah it's that
00:55:44 it's literally that feeling and it's like
00:55:46 how do you fix that
00:55:48 well you know what
00:55:50 let me just give one other counter example
00:55:52 you know what I'll tell you how you fix it
00:55:54 you do it eventually
00:55:56 I've been enjoying video games which is
00:55:58 you go and
00:56:00 watch videos of people
00:56:02 reviewing old games
00:56:04 and then find out
00:56:06 what ones are interesting and then go play
00:56:08 interesting old games and fuck
00:56:10 all that shit
00:56:12 how was that more work
00:56:14 I don't get it
00:56:16 I'm not specifically asking about like video game hype
00:56:18 because obviously the thing is just wait for it
00:56:20 to come out and then look at reviews
00:56:22 so that you don't get disappointed but like
00:56:24 I'm trying to figure out why people are so
00:56:26 set on being hyped that it makes them so angry
00:56:28 when people
00:56:30 quash their hype or tell them not to get too excited
00:56:32 because they're
00:56:34 it feels bad though
00:56:36 I don't know whether people were this hopeful years ago
00:56:38 is it because the world sucks more and we're so
00:56:40 we're so
00:56:42 we're so
00:56:44 we're too
00:56:46 we're too linked in with the brain nodes
00:56:48 to all of the bad things that are happening
00:56:50 we just want something
00:56:52 probably
00:56:54 I totally agree
00:56:56 that is a real thing that sucks
00:56:58 I've had people tell me that I ruined anime
00:57:00 for them because they started
00:57:02 looking at it too critically and now
00:57:04 maybe anime was never good guys
00:57:06 and I'm just like well I don't know how you could
00:57:08 reach like I don't know how I could bring you
00:57:10 to that conclusion because I'm thinking about it more critically
00:57:12 than you are and I still find shit to like
00:57:14 all the time dude that's that's how I feel about
00:57:16 I shit on one pieces little imperfections all the time
00:57:18 but I always end with one piece is my
00:57:20 favorite thing ever and people still
00:57:22 take away that I'm like taken away their joy
00:57:24 which I find perplexing
00:57:26 but I uh yeah I mean it's the same
00:57:28 same phenomenon I love
00:57:30 Dragon Age but I also love all the
00:57:32 videos at Bastion Dragon Age because so
00:57:34 interesting to see like
00:57:36 what sort of issues people have
00:57:38 with Dragon Age and I can go
00:57:40 hmm oh okay that's an interesting view
00:57:42 I'm about to go very pretentious
00:57:44 you know what it is it's that their love
00:57:46 is shallow and not founded
00:57:48 on critical thinking it's founded on shallow
00:57:50 hype and so when we criticize
00:57:52 from a deeper level perspective they
00:57:54 have lost their argument they have nothing
00:57:56 to fall back on because they haven't really thought about it
00:57:58 until this point I think there's also a lot
00:58:00 of identity tied up in it because nobody
00:58:02 wants to have bad taste
00:58:04 and like there's a lot of reasons to like
00:58:06 something um you don't
00:58:08 have to like every part of it like you
00:58:10 should not expect to like absolutely
00:58:12 everything about anything like maybe
00:58:14 you like 99% of it there's only
00:58:16 one thing that bothers you but it's still like
00:58:18 worth addressing but there's some people
00:58:20 who are like if you point out that it's
00:58:22 flawed at all that it's like oh shit are you
00:58:24 trying to tell me that my favorite thing isn't the
00:58:26 best possible thing like I can't
00:58:28 be wrong about this but it's like
00:58:30 you have enough experience to know
00:58:32 that there are other things other stories
00:58:34 that are more complete
00:58:36 that don't have these issues that this
00:58:38 thing has and it's like look one piece
00:58:40 is my favorite thing it has
00:58:42 more good in it more things I care about
00:58:44 in it than anything else but
00:58:46 I have seen things that didn't fuck up
00:58:48 the way this thing has you know let me tell you
00:58:50 there was one perfect example of this I was
00:58:52 talking to Pa Diaz Gord boys yesterday about
00:58:54 this issue do like this is this is the
00:58:56 perfect example okay so early on in one
00:58:58 piece there's a thing called the log pose
00:59:00 this is just how they got through the grand line
00:59:02 okay cool it's a compass
00:59:04 that guides you along towards the end
00:59:06 okay but but but here's the thing
00:59:08 here's the thing it when they get to the
00:59:10 new world after like the halfway point of
00:59:12 the time skip or whatever like Nami gets
00:59:14 a new log pose that has
00:59:16 like three nodes it's like it's like a it's an
00:59:18 upgrade it's I believe it's
00:59:20 only used one time to
00:59:22 get them to punk hazard after
00:59:24 they leave Fishman Island it's like the first
00:59:26 place they go after the time skip basically
00:59:28 okay the log pose like
00:59:30 automate a big deal out of this log pose
00:59:32 and like establishing this was he even goes
00:59:34 on like a little spiel about in the narrative
00:59:36 like this is how you will find your way further
00:59:38 you know towards the end of the grand line
00:59:40 in one piece but but though
00:59:42 that log pose has not been
00:59:44 used for the last like five
00:59:46 arcs and they've been traveling through
00:59:48 totally other means and basically
00:59:50 it basically seems like the log pose
00:59:52 yes it could come back to relevance later
00:59:54 it basically seems like it's been totally
00:59:56 abandoned because after that plot point
00:59:58 Oda introduced a totally different
01:00:00 like end point that doesn't involve
01:00:02 the log pose basically at all with these
01:00:04 road poneglas and now those
01:00:06 are the true way to get to like
01:00:08 Raftel or Laugh's tail and to like
01:00:10 actually beat like he he
01:00:12 pretty clearly he introduces this element
01:00:14 at the beginning of like after the time skip as
01:00:16 this is the new thing we're doing but then
01:00:18 he totally has scrapped it later which to
01:00:20 me just clearly reveals he did not
01:00:22 actually have this plan all the way thought
01:00:24 through and he just changed tax I don't
01:00:26 see how any of this is
01:00:28 necessarily a bad thing like you're
01:00:30 saying that like the fact that he didn't
01:00:32 plan certain things make sure like
01:00:34 does it make you dislike one piece
01:00:36 I mean I guess you could argue that this is the problem
01:00:38 time wasted in the narrative
01:00:40 emotional emotional investment
01:00:42 you see the thing is the thing is
01:00:44 I like this for the log pose
01:00:46 the thing I like one of the things I love
01:00:48 about one piece is that
01:00:50 you know there's so many curveballs
01:00:52 despite the fact that it's been going on so long
01:00:54 and so many arcs are like
01:00:56 on surface level seems similar
01:00:58 but a lot of things happen in them that are just
01:01:00 so like unexpected even though
01:01:02 you know I mean you know
01:01:04 what this reminds me of is the equivalent
01:01:06 there's an equivalent to this there was a time
01:01:08 when before the time skip the
01:01:10 strats meet this guy Papagu he's a starfish
01:01:12 he says I'm best friends
01:01:14 with the mermaid princess after the
01:01:16 time skip like because because
01:01:18 Oda did not plan this after the time
01:01:20 skip when they meet Papagu
01:01:22 they're like hey didn't you say you were friends
01:01:24 with the mermaid princess and the character says
01:01:26 because now like the way that
01:01:28 Oda writes the story it wouldn't make sense for him
01:01:30 to have met the mermaid princess Papagu
01:01:32 says oops I was lying
01:01:34 before that is clear indication
01:01:36 of Oda thinking
01:01:38 on his feet having to change
01:01:40 like what did this character canonically lie for
01:01:42 no other reason other than
01:01:44 to appear a little bit shady later
01:01:46 no that's because that's not the guy's character
01:01:48 in the context of his first
01:01:50 appearance surely like he was
01:01:52 always a bit of a showboating like
01:01:54 like
01:01:56 I'm not defending it
01:01:58 but I'm like I'm criticizing
01:02:00 your criticism you're saying it's absolutely
01:02:02 like certified proof
01:02:04 that Oda no I'm not saying that I'm saying
01:02:06 it's very strong
01:02:08 saying that there's room for it to not like
01:02:10 Papagu is like
01:02:12 he was kind of like that I mean it's kind of stupid
01:02:14 but I don't think that in any way
01:02:16 like lessens my
01:02:18 appreciation of the thing it's just sort of
01:02:20 look it just means it's a flaw
01:02:22 it doesn't ruin one piece it's just
01:02:24 clearly it's not a hundred percent confirmed
01:02:26 but it's very likely just proof
01:02:28 I mean to get the
01:02:30 reason for the log pose thing
01:02:32 the point of this all is that when you introduce
01:02:34 a plot element that you expect to be capitalized
01:02:36 on and the narrative sets you up like
01:02:38 the log pose served great purpose through
01:02:40 the beginning of one piece and absolutely
01:02:42 fulfilled its function and I have no criticisms
01:02:44 but when he goes all out of his way
01:02:46 to introduce that it's going to be used in this way
01:02:48 and then totally changes tech
01:02:50 that's where it's like oh like I thought
01:02:52 we were getting like maybe the new thing is
01:02:54 even better but it's not crazy
01:02:56 to be like oh you kind of dropped this
01:02:58 other thing I guess that's too bad maybe
01:03:00 it's for the best but like I just wish you
01:03:02 hadn't bothered doing that before
01:03:04 since you know it wasn't going to do
01:03:06 anything what this reminds me of in
01:03:08 another manga that I know all three of us have read
01:03:10 is Bakuman
01:03:12 so like
01:03:14 in Bakuman which is like it's
01:03:16 my favorite manga you know like so much
01:03:18 good shit happens it's so
01:03:20 interesting as a look into the industry
01:03:22 especially into the magazine of Shonen
01:03:24 Jump and like the mentality
01:03:26 which with these stories
01:03:28 of being written which you can also apply to
01:03:30 the manga itself which is really interesting
01:03:32 in a meta sense because like
01:03:34 in Bakuman they're writing
01:03:36 a story that is clearly
01:03:38 based on death note which they had
01:03:40 before real the same guys had written
01:03:42 and like in the
01:03:44 in Bakuman they're saying
01:03:46 that they want to end the series
01:03:48 when the rivalry ends
01:03:50 like when one of the characters dies
01:03:52 and like there's nothing more to the rivalry
01:03:54 that's where the manga should end
01:03:56 but they're already making
01:03:58 an anime adaptation
01:04:00 so the animators are like
01:04:02 can you keep the manga running
01:04:04 and in Bakuman
01:04:06 they do not they cancel the manga
01:04:08 so that it can have a real ending
01:04:10 and
01:04:12 and it ends up working out
01:04:14 but that's not what happened with death note
01:04:16 death note had
01:04:18 continued on and everybody hates the later section
01:04:20 so obviously they're trying to make
01:04:22 like they're trying to explain
01:04:24 why that happened
01:04:26 and kind of make good on it in the next manga
01:04:28 like you know we get to live the fantasy
01:04:30 leave out the fantasy of what if we could have ended
01:04:32 the story when we wanted to end it
01:04:34 but the funny thing about it is that
01:04:36 Bakuman also teaches us
01:04:38 basically L did nothing wrong
01:04:40 sorry I mean light did nothing wrong
01:04:42 that Shonen Jump manga are designed to go on
01:04:44 for as long as possible
01:04:46 like they might have an ending
01:04:48 in mind and certain ones
01:04:50 are designed to be shorter
01:04:52 but like one piece was designed
01:04:54 for instance with the capacity
01:04:56 to go for as long as Oda
01:04:58 had continued to have ideas
01:05:00 and inevitably
01:05:02 if he keeps adding in new things
01:05:04 like I'm sure he does have the ending planned
01:05:06 and like the basic structure of the story planned
01:05:08 but like you know he wants to add
01:05:10 in new stuff and sometimes he adds in something
01:05:12 and then going along just like
01:05:14 oh this isn't as good of an idea
01:05:16 and or like oh I had a better idea later
01:05:18 of what this could have been
01:05:20 let's just fucking let's just go
01:05:22 with that instead you know
01:05:24 you're totally right Digi and like
01:05:26 such things are 100% inevitable
01:05:28 I simply will not ignore
01:05:30 no and the funny thing about it is that
01:05:32 Akumon shows you how that's the case
01:05:34 but it also has that flaw itself
01:05:36 because they introduce this character
01:05:38 relatively like
01:05:40 later into the series because like
01:05:42 most of the stuff that the main characters
01:05:44 have had to deal with is like their personal growth
01:05:46 in the early part of the manga
01:05:48 then once they've like started to become successful
01:05:50 they deal with the problem of having a shitty editor
01:05:52 and that's like a whole arc
01:05:54 it's like volumes of them dealing with this editor
01:05:56 and then they reach the stage
01:05:58 where they have to be competitive with other people
01:06:00 who are other manga authors in the magazine
01:06:02 everybody starting new series
01:06:04 they all have to keep their stuff interesting
01:06:06 they struggle with you know different kinds of things
01:06:08 and then there's the part
01:06:10 where they discover the serious comedy
01:06:12 which is like their personal style that they're going to use
01:06:14 to get popular which you can see in Death Note
01:06:16 you know so it all ties in
01:06:18 it's a good metatapestry
01:06:20 but then like 14 volumes in
01:06:22 they introduce a character
01:06:24 who's like a weird
01:06:26 mastermind character
01:06:28 he's like this evil guy
01:06:30 who's like hiring
01:06:32 old manga authors to
01:06:34 is this the guy who writes by committee?
01:06:36 the guy who like
01:06:38 yeah he
01:06:40 it was the guy who was like trying to overthrow
01:06:42 he was like trying to make it to number one by coming up
01:06:44 with really crazy concepts and giving them to like
01:06:46 old retired manga authors
01:06:48 this is the guy who made up Panty Flash Fight
01:06:50 right? yes
01:06:52 he creates Panty Flash Fight
01:06:54 and like because of
01:06:56 Panty Flash Fight being so great
01:06:58 and his introduction like
01:07:00 his first arc is okay but it's kind of weird
01:07:02 because he's a very different like he's not a realistic
01:07:04 character you know
01:07:06 like up to this point this is felt like a real story
01:07:08 about what happens when you create manga for jump
01:07:10 now we've got like a super villain
01:07:12 and then they kind of
01:07:14 beat him and the story
01:07:16 continues along but then really
01:07:18 weirdly like three or four volumes
01:07:20 before the end of the manga because it's 20
01:07:22 volumes long they reintroduce
01:07:24 him and they start setting up for a
01:07:26 second even more complicated
01:07:28 arc where he has a really weird
01:07:30 scheme that didn't really make sense
01:07:32 the second arc
01:07:34 he has like a team he hires like a whole team
01:07:36 they write by committee
01:07:38 basically but it was kind
01:07:40 of unclear like what his goals were
01:07:42 and like ultimately
01:07:44 this arc just kind of
01:07:46 it starts it's like setting up
01:07:48 but then it's taking too long
01:07:50 and it's clear at this point that like we're close enough
01:07:52 to the end of bakuman's story
01:07:54 that we do not need another arc
01:07:56 like this manga could end
01:07:58 it could wrap up soon and it would be satisfying
01:08:00 um you know we're already well
01:08:02 into the characters careers
01:08:04 all that's really left is to finish off the like
01:08:06 central romance and all that stuff
01:08:08 like and get them the number one manga you know
01:08:10 wrap up reverse side but like we've introduced
01:08:12 this new villain arc and then it
01:08:14 just kind of wraps
01:08:16 and it's obviously because
01:08:18 people saw this and went
01:08:20 this isn't really that interesting you know
01:08:22 and the authors kind of went uh yeah
01:08:24 fuck it and like it ends really abruptly
01:08:26 this arc like it's
01:08:28 it still seems like it's in the setup phase
01:08:30 and then all of a sudden they like wrap everything up
01:08:32 and boot him from the story and then there's just like
01:08:34 a volume and a half left before the story
01:08:36 ends and I really think it was like
01:08:38 you know they thought they could just keep it going
01:08:40 but then they started this arc and it was kind of
01:08:42 retarded so they just said uh
01:08:44 fuck it let's move on I remember that character
01:08:46 pretty well because he embodied
01:08:48 like a um it was basically
01:08:50 like this when he comes back from
01:08:52 he's got this team that he hired to sort of like
01:08:54 all like get together and make a think tank
01:08:56 about what would be the perfect manga
01:08:58 and like they kind of do it and it's kind of
01:09:00 working but then that one older guy
01:09:02 comes in and he like and he just
01:09:04 like tells this like story he's had in his head
01:09:06 for years and it's like his passion project
01:09:08 and it beats them in the polls or something
01:09:10 so I mean I'm sure they could have done more
01:09:12 with that arc but like I mean that arc
01:09:14 that character that arc is there
01:09:16 for a reason and like it does explore
01:09:18 a theme I just remember like yeah
01:09:20 I just remember it feeling weird
01:09:22 that he came back that like they
01:09:24 had thoroughly bested this guy
01:09:26 and then like in the like such a late stage
01:09:28 of the game when like we really are
01:09:30 you know we're more focused on the main characters
01:09:32 and like them wrapping up their arcs
01:09:34 and then all of a sudden this shit comes out of nowhere
01:09:36 and there's a ton of exposition like
01:09:38 tons of explaining what this plan is
01:09:40 and uh it was just
01:09:42 kind of like this is like a diversion
01:09:44 you know this is this is
01:09:46 not as interesting as the main story
01:09:48 and then it just kind of wraps up and then the story ends
01:09:50 it's true that it's true that
01:09:52 it's like a slight black mark on the series
01:09:54 it's true those guys aren't as interesting
01:09:56 that villain is not as interesting as like
01:09:58 the main characters like personal
01:10:00 struggle and whatever I think I think that's like
01:10:02 okay I guess it's like
01:10:04 the manga's attempt to sort of comment
01:10:06 on like a trend in manga that maybe
01:10:08 the the the authors
01:10:10 don't really approve of like the like
01:10:12 outsourcing your writing
01:10:14 or writing by committee
01:10:16 I think I think they're good ideas
01:10:18 my like as time has gone
01:10:20 I've become a little more annoyed
01:10:22 by how much of how much
01:10:24 Apologia Bakumon engages in
01:10:26 for like the like
01:10:28 you know just like the worst
01:10:30 tendencies of the manga and like
01:10:32 Japanese cultural markets in general
01:10:34 like the way that it's it's sort of
01:10:36 criticizes the whole idle
01:10:38 thing and like oh isn't it
01:10:40 wacky that they're not allowed to have boyfriends
01:10:42 so people can imagine that they could
01:10:44 date them one day it's it doesn't
01:10:46 go hard enough into like weird shit like that
01:10:48 I don't know it's a little too
01:10:50 it's a little too willing to forgive the manga
01:10:52 Anderson be like oh that's just the way
01:10:54 it really also comment on
01:10:56 like it doesn't really criticize the like
01:10:58 absurd crunch that is the
01:11:00 job you know like it's
01:11:02 as it is
01:11:04 but it's just well it's just like
01:11:06 the people who work for jump it's like I mean you gotta
01:11:08 be this kind of person like yeah I mean
01:11:10 just consider like the people writing the story
01:11:12 are people who chose this lifestyle it seems
01:11:14 reasonable they would you know be pretty
01:11:16 into it unless they like hate it but
01:11:18 they're choosing to do it so I assume
01:11:20 they find some value and definitely seen a bunch
01:11:22 of criticisms of bakumon online from people
01:11:24 who like work in the manga industry
01:11:26 and just felt that like it didn't present
01:11:28 it realistically enough like
01:11:30 in terms of the the troubles
01:11:32 of it and like even though
01:11:34 the manga does go out of its
01:11:36 way to have the characters encounter
01:11:38 like lots of common problems that happen
01:11:40 to people like through this just
01:11:42 the necessity of the fact that they are
01:11:44 it's a story about them becoming the number
01:11:46 one you know so like
01:11:48 ultimately things are gonna go
01:11:50 yeah under like better than they normally
01:11:52 would because most manga
01:11:54 authors don't make it to know I have
01:11:56 these characters are major critically
01:11:58 create like they are the perfect mangaka
01:12:00 I love bakumon
01:12:02 I've long had a criticism is that the one
01:12:04 greatest of the main character disgusts me
01:12:06 it utterly repulsed me
01:12:08 his obsession with the one girl
01:12:10 like who even cares I'm not even interested
01:12:12 in the
01:12:14 it serves as a good motivation beyond that
01:12:16 I never cared about the girl at all
01:12:18 it would have been better if they just made her more of a character
01:12:20 like she's just kind of a trophy
01:12:22 yeah absolutely I wanted
01:12:24 she had like an arc that'd be great
01:12:26 her arc is non-existent
01:12:28 I mean I guess it's her becoming a voice actor
01:12:30 she's pretty much just a macguffin for like
01:12:32 95% of it
01:12:34 she does become a successful voice actress
01:12:36 but like we barely focus on that at all
01:12:38 she has a story just not like
01:12:40 a character arc
01:12:42 maybe that story is covered in girl jump
01:12:44 I mean I don't read girl jump
01:12:46 I would show it in jump because I'm a boy
01:12:48 yeah her character doesn't really do that much
01:12:50 but like I guess they used her
01:12:52 as sort of a vehicle
01:12:54 you know they comment on the whole idol thing
01:12:56 which is like yeah okay that's I guess you wanted to
01:12:58 talk about that
01:13:00 it reminds me that I need to watch
01:13:02 what's that anime you love so much didgy
01:13:04 with the guys becoming animators
01:13:06 and becoming a share of friends
01:13:08 share of friends
01:13:10 even I've seen share of friends
01:13:12 I've been fucking around Ben
01:13:14 I know
01:13:16 I'm a little mad still about like the
01:13:18 the one piece
01:13:20 the thing with the Papaku
01:13:22 I went a little hard there
01:13:24 I have like a thing because it's like
01:13:26 the ending of death note whether it continued
01:13:28 the point where it should have ended
01:13:30 that's like a flaw that I feel is a notable flaw
01:13:32 and I could understand people getting upset
01:13:34 about it and I could also understand people
01:13:36 ignoring it but you know
01:13:38 it's more understandable that people would be upset
01:13:40 something like
01:13:42 the whole like Papagu lied thing
01:13:44 it's so insignificant
01:13:46 Papagu lied people died
01:13:48 it's like why would anyone devote
01:13:50 memory to something like I've read the
01:13:52 thing I remember him saying that when you
01:13:54 say it but like it doesn't
01:13:56 mean so much to like devote
01:13:58 any memory to it
01:14:00 it's Nate's autism is the problem
01:14:04 it's like you can't
01:14:06 some of us cannot erase
01:14:08 this thing from our minds it's like
01:14:10 just the knowledge that
01:14:12 knowing Nate and
01:14:14 knowing Ben because you guys are both really into
01:14:16 stories being as robust as possible that
01:14:18 like every question has an answer
01:14:20 everything like makes
01:14:22 sense in context and it's like
01:14:24 it's not that you expect one piece
01:14:26 to be perfect it's not that
01:14:28 you would
01:14:30 you would most like it to have been
01:14:32 perfect but it's no big deal
01:14:34 because in the end there's just so much
01:14:36 in one piece that it's like it's not comparable
01:14:38 to anything else it's like
01:14:40 if that takes it down from like a
01:14:42 100 to a
01:14:44 999
01:14:46 1000 to a 999
01:14:48 the next show is at like a
01:14:50 7000
01:14:52 yes
01:14:54 right like that's again
01:14:56 like let's say that you're
01:14:58 you're thinking of it as like a
01:15:00 954
01:15:02 and this takes it down to a
01:15:04 943 you know again the next show
01:15:06 is at like
01:15:08 it's like you make a pie you make a pie
01:15:10 and maybe you burn a little bit
01:15:12 of the crime maybe like maybe that's got a lump
01:15:14 in it or something but like you know it doesn't
01:15:16 make it doesn't make it a bad pie
01:15:18 it doesn't really even make it a worse pie it makes
01:15:20 it a rustic pie
01:15:22 you can see the author that's the author's finger
01:15:24 that's the author's finger you run into a little
01:15:26 you run into a little gristle in your steak
01:15:28 you just pull that shit out of your mouth
01:15:30 and put it on the side of the plate and you go
01:15:32 man I wish I didn't have to look at this on the side of my plate
01:15:34 but whatever you go remember that time
01:15:36 that Oda introduced that one guy
01:15:38 and he said this one thing and then like the next time
01:15:40 he was like oh I was just lying about that haha
01:15:42 what what a gas
01:15:44 it was just it was just such a small
01:15:46 moment I think it's just that I can't
01:15:48 imagine defaulting like
01:15:50 part of like I've only got so much
01:15:52 memory I've only got so many gigabytes
01:15:54 in my brain like I'd rather
01:15:56 fill it with like joy
01:15:58 than like anything like stupid
01:16:00 well I mean sure surely
01:16:02 you realize your memory shaming me right now
01:16:04 surely you understand that this is unacceptable behavior
01:16:06 I know I mean if anything I'm memory
01:16:08 shaming me because I have less maybe
01:16:10 and then you have so much
01:16:12 you have like a big brain or something
01:16:14 and you got all the one key
01:16:16 flaws like take up like a thousand
01:16:18 terabytes
01:16:20 you know it's just it when I point out stuff like
01:16:22 this I get your perspective give and we've long
01:16:24 approached one piece at the very beginning
01:16:26 of our show we approach it even from more
01:16:28 kind of different perspectives you said that
01:16:30 I think you said something like you didn't understand
01:16:32 one piece had flaws or I'm not
01:16:34 trying to say no I think I said it like
01:16:36 I never like I just loved it so much
01:16:38 that like I criticizing
01:16:40 it was never even in my brain
01:16:42 how much
01:16:44 how many times have you read through one piece
01:16:46 all the way
01:16:48 I haven't read through it all the way
01:16:50 I've I've watched the anime
01:16:52 all the way to like episode like
01:16:54 500 couple times
01:16:56 good lord even I haven't read
01:16:58 every single chapter going back I just go back
01:17:00 and regularly read excerpts from there
01:17:02 it seems like
01:17:04 it seems like you are like always going back
01:17:06 through shit so like
01:17:08 discussion I pulled from like
01:17:10 we went back yesterday arguing about
01:17:12 like exactly what Raftel was arguing about
01:17:14 Ponyglyphs I went and re-read like several
01:17:16 chapters to do research for this
01:17:18 ongoing live discussion that benefited
01:17:20 me 0% just because
01:17:22 I wanted to make sure I had the correct information
01:17:24 like that's the way I can say I did go back
01:17:26 set of kind of recently
01:17:28 to reread Dressrosa which is like
01:17:30 one of the longest and
01:17:32 controversialist arcs
01:17:34 because of the amount of stuff that gets
01:17:36 shoved into it and it sort of makes it
01:17:38 at the second half of it sort of ruins
01:17:40 it gets ruined by the amount of
01:17:42 like character climaxes
01:17:44 that are supposed to be going on and nothing
01:17:46 you know I wanted to make sure
01:17:48 that like
01:17:50 like hindsight we weren't like shitting on it too hard
01:17:52 or anything do you do you stand by
01:17:54 your general feelings before
01:17:56 is it oh yeah I mean it's all stuff
01:17:58 the first half of Dressrosa
01:18:00 is really good though which is why
01:18:02 I think I understand why people still
01:18:04 like is they think of the first half of it
01:18:06 and then there's plenty
01:18:08 it's just sort of like there's three
01:18:10 characters that have a back
01:18:12 story that have a
01:18:14 climax with the
01:18:16 you know the final fight with everyone
01:18:18 yeah and if you
01:18:20 had only one of those it would be a perfect
01:18:22 really good arc but because
01:18:24 there's two or three then it's just like too much
01:18:26 you know here's one
01:18:28 of the problems is that we're selling with Skypia
01:18:30 like everything perfectly in a
01:18:32 writing sense swirled into the ringing
01:18:34 of the bell like every character had attachment
01:18:36 to the ringing of the bell
01:18:38 and the defeat of Enru with Dressrosa
01:18:40 for example it's like totally separate
01:18:42 plots that vaguely tie into
01:18:44 Doflamingo but like they're kind of just
01:18:46 independent like Rebecca and Kyros
01:18:48 their mom getting killed by
01:18:50 Diamante like sure that
01:18:52 technically ties into Doflamingo but really
01:18:54 that was a Diamante thing and so they fight
01:18:56 him and get revenge on him wasn't
01:18:58 really like Doflamingo personally
01:19:00 like if it was like
01:19:02 like you know
01:19:04 if Doflamingo ruined this kingdom
01:19:06 the story then it would be great
01:19:08 if it was Doflamingo ruined Law's backstory
01:19:10 without Dressrosa
01:19:12 then it would be great but because it's both
01:19:14 they neither character has
01:19:16 a satisfying end at the end of that
01:19:18 anyway
01:19:20 let me just say my one final point
01:19:22 on the one piece subject is just that like
01:19:24 a lot of people you know I love one piece
01:19:26 but you know people here we talk about it critically a lot
01:19:28 because those are the main things that I focus on
01:19:30 because I don't know maybe that's just how my brain is wired
01:19:32 and interesting but
01:19:34 it's just true that none of this
01:19:36 moves the needle particularly far
01:19:38 and when I bring up these little examples
01:19:40 like Papagu that being a mistake
01:19:42 like these are just examples that
01:19:44 I mean I have a pretty good memory of one piece stuff
01:19:46 generally speaking I don't remember everything
01:19:48 it's just that I remember them but I don't
01:19:50 it doesn't keep me like people
01:19:52 disproportionately think they bother me or disproportionately
01:19:54 make me think that one piece is way
01:19:56 worse than I actually think it is
01:19:58 I think that you hate one piece
01:20:00 because of Papagu but it's like
01:20:02 I guess
01:20:04 I question the motivation to
01:20:06 devote memory to this
01:20:08 like I don't think I have a choice
01:20:10 if it builds up to such a level
01:20:12 will you hate one piece more
01:20:14 like if it's death by a thousand cuts
01:20:16 if the flaws of one piece
01:20:18 if the flaws of one piece piled up then absolutely
01:20:20 yeah absolutely nothing is sacred
01:20:22 small flaws like Papagu like happening
01:20:24 like a lot
01:20:26 would be not that bad
01:20:28 but like a big flaw would be
01:20:30 like if it ended badly
01:20:32 then it would be bad but if there was
01:20:34 a bunch of Papagu's
01:20:36 there's fears that one piece will end badly
01:20:38 and the things like the Papagu mistake
01:20:40 what they really do is they reveal like
01:20:42 oh that Papagu thing really reveals
01:20:44 he did not 100% plan that arc
01:20:46 that doesn't really matter to me
01:20:48 I would still argue that it does not
01:20:50 necessarily reveal that
01:20:52 I mean okay
01:20:54 I think it does
01:20:56 I imagine the reason is because
01:20:58 him knowing the princess
01:21:00 got you hyped for meeting the princess
01:21:02 thanks to Papagu or something
01:21:04 I just didn't think- I didn't even really care about that
01:21:06 well that's the thing if it didn't matter when it was set up
01:21:08 then when it gets like
01:21:10 the setup that you didn't care about
01:21:12 didn't have a payoff
01:21:14 or had a payoff that you didn't care about
01:21:16 then what is the problem
01:21:18 because what is the issue there
01:21:20 is that it reveals Oda did not
01:21:22 have a plan and it caused him to make a mistake
01:21:24 in his narrative
01:21:26 I can't
01:21:28 whatever
01:21:30 you can just say the good outweighs the bad
01:21:32 so it doesn't matter to you
01:21:34 I'm arguing that the bad that you're explaining is not bad
01:21:36 it's not even a thing
01:21:38 well then I guess we just disagree
01:21:40 I've made my case
01:21:42 die
01:21:46 let me just go way back to the beginning of this
01:21:48 because I've got one final point we can move on
01:21:50 talking about anything else
01:21:52 way back when we were talking about Zelda
01:21:54 I just went like because I tweeted
01:21:56 like hey guys tell me if Zelda is good or bad
01:21:58 it was interesting to me for what most people said
01:22:00 when I said guys is this game good
01:22:02 most people said that like
01:22:04 Nate you will like it
01:22:06 without giving a lot of detail
01:22:08 the people who gave more detail would say like
01:22:10 it still plays fun if you like the old Zelda you like that
01:22:12 but there was a very large contingent of people
01:22:14 who were just saying like it looks great
01:22:16 play it like it's fun
01:22:18 these are very general non-specific terms
01:22:20 and I don't blame anybody
01:22:22 for not giving me the exact details
01:22:24 that I would find most interesting
01:22:26 I'm just asking random people on Twitter
01:22:28 there's nothing wrong with that
01:22:30 but it was Digi's video
01:22:32 that gave me the kind of detail I wanted
01:22:34 I mean Digi hadn't played a ton
01:22:36 but just that one observation
01:22:38 that like in the original
01:22:40 everything's broken into square units
01:22:42 and like as a result of that
01:22:44 the village feels bigger
01:22:46 that's how it was intended to be played
01:22:48 and by radically changing how the game plays
01:22:50 it totally changes how the game feels
01:22:52 and these illusions we create
01:22:54 for ourselves
01:22:56 Digi's point I thought this was a brilliant point
01:22:58 like it's way easier in the original
01:23:00 to feel that this is an abstraction
01:23:02 of a village that like in quote-unquote
01:23:04 real life would be you know
01:23:06 bigger have more to do etc etc
01:23:08 but by making it like a playhouse
01:23:10 that's the design sense they're going for
01:23:12 like now it feels real
01:23:14 but like oh this really is like an insubstantial
01:23:16 village it really is that this isn't
01:23:18 like a real village and that I
01:23:20 I'm not as into that
01:23:22 there's one thing that I had not
01:23:24 observed when I made the video
01:23:26 because I haven't actually played the game
01:23:28 and it's an argument
01:23:30 that I think can work to make the game
01:23:32 interesting it's still very different from the original
01:23:34 it still changes it fundamentally
01:23:36 but the thing about Link's Awakening
01:23:38 and I guess this is a spoiler
01:23:40 but I don't care
01:23:42 the whole game is a dream
01:23:44 because Link
01:23:46 it's the same Link from a Link to the Past
01:23:48 he is knocked out
01:23:50 during a storm
01:23:52 and in both versions of the game
01:23:54 the opening cutscene is an anime cinematic
01:23:56 it's like
01:23:58 in the original game you see him
01:24:00 as like a full-bodied
01:24:02 you know Link
01:24:04 he looks like the Link from a Link to the Past
01:24:06 if he was drawn as an anime character
01:24:08 but like you know
01:24:10 when you see the Game Boy graphics
01:24:12 it's a very abstract representation of that character
01:24:14 when you see it in
01:24:16 Link's Awakening they still have the cutscene
01:24:18 where he is drawn as like a fully formed
01:24:20 man
01:24:22 so like it's only in the dream world
01:24:24 that he looks like a play set
01:24:26 and you know there's the tinges
01:24:28 on the edge of the screen where everything has that
01:24:30 like blur effect
01:24:32 so you could argue that even though it is
01:24:34 literally meant to look like a play set
01:24:36 it is a dream world
01:24:38 and like
01:24:40 in the real world Link is
01:24:42 the Link from a Link to the Past
01:24:44 he is still drawn as an adult man
01:24:46 this is just what the world looks like
01:24:48 inside his dream
01:24:50 and so that's kind of good
01:24:52 but it still changes everything
01:24:54 yeah it's kind of good but it's like that wasn't the intention
01:24:56 of the world in the Game Boy
01:24:58 original
01:25:00 no it was not portrayed that way
01:25:02 it was more meant to just feel like a fever dream version
01:25:04 of a Link to the Past
01:25:06 it's meant to be a direct sequel
01:25:08 I mean in the original
01:25:10 I think it's more of a twist to realize
01:25:12 that it's all a dream
01:25:14 and you could argue that that's more valuable
01:25:16 I think like generally you should
01:25:18 err on the side of the original
01:25:20 especially if it's a short game
01:25:22 you play that first
01:25:24 and then the new game will just be like
01:25:26 oh quality of life improvements
01:25:28 oh it looks nicer
01:25:30 and then the original experiences is maintained
01:25:32 because I'm in the position of
01:25:34 I beat Link's Awakening
01:25:36 years ago
01:25:38 I'm in the perfect moment
01:25:40 where
01:25:42 I would rather play the new version
01:25:44 with the new art style and the new controls
01:25:46 just to
01:25:48 if I'm going to play it again why not play this one
01:25:50 but like if I was right now
01:25:52 today in a situation where
01:25:54 I had never played either one
01:25:56 I would 100% recommend DX
01:25:58 over the new game because the new game is $60
01:26:00 and DX you can play for free
01:26:02 and like it's great
01:26:04 fucking game you will not be let down
01:26:06 like we live streamed it
01:26:08 for my last live stream in May
01:26:10 was having the time of her fucking life playing that game
01:26:12 which is like two hours of just like
01:26:14 not even paying attention to what
01:26:16 I was talking about in the chat
01:26:18 just being like completely enthralled
01:26:20 in this fucking Game Boy game because like
01:26:22 it takes you back man
01:26:24 those classic top-down Zeldas are great
01:26:26 I played them all I fucking love them back in the day
01:26:28 I love Zelda 1
01:26:30 I love Link to the past
01:26:32 it would probably be a fun game
01:26:34 if it wasn't such a fucking pain in the ass
01:26:36 but that one plays totally different
01:26:38 Oracle of Seasons and Ages were like
01:26:40 my favorite games growing up
01:26:42 they were so fucking sick
01:26:44 the Minish Cap is like one of my top
01:26:46 yeah that too
01:26:48 I fucking loved the shit out of
01:26:50 I never had a Gamecube so I never played Wind Waker
01:26:52 but I loved Phantom Hourglass
01:26:54 I thought Phantom Hourglass was the shit
01:26:56 oh yeah I had that as well
01:26:58 I did not play that because of the fact that
01:27:00 with the touch screen and it was just like
01:27:02 let me tell you this lads
01:27:04 you have a journal in that game and one of the things you have to do
01:27:06 is in a certain dungeon
01:27:08 it uses the two dual screen
01:27:10 the DS was the best console ever made
01:27:12 fuck every other console and one of the things you have to do
01:27:14 is you have to stamp your thing
01:27:16 you have to physically fucking close
01:27:18 and open the fucking DS
01:27:20 to stamp your journal
01:27:22 I went Gadzooks for that shit
01:27:24 you have to blow in the microphone
01:27:26 to blow away sand
01:27:28 you can't get that kind of quality
01:27:30 with a fucking switch
01:27:32 with a piece of shit PC
01:27:34 what about the Wii U
01:27:36 you can probably do it on the Wii U
01:27:38 that's a decent comment
01:27:40 you have to snap
01:27:42 I'm gonna snap my switch in half
01:27:44 as I'm emulating the fucking Phantom Hourglass
01:27:46 on that fucking game
01:27:48 you just have to buy a switch to light and tape them together
01:27:50 that's their long game
01:27:52 console gimmicks are great
01:27:54 I know I've basically given up
01:27:56 and become a switch man
01:27:58 but it still makes me sad to think about the fact that I think the Wii U is better
01:28:00 as an idea
01:28:02 having the
01:28:04 two screens
01:28:06 two screens was a great idea
01:28:08 on the DS and the 3DS
01:28:10 and translating it to a console was a great idea
01:28:12 I still really want to play zombie U
01:28:14 it made Zelda the best it could possibly be
01:28:16 is zombie U good?
01:28:18 I have no idea
01:28:20 it's such a fucking good cool idea
01:28:22 of the Wii U
01:28:24 the way zombie U works
01:28:26 is that the game
01:28:28 it's like a first person zombie apocalypse kind of game
01:28:30 and you walk around
01:28:32 you kill zombies and shit
01:28:34 but the controller is your backpack
01:28:36 and that's how you do all your item management stuff
01:28:38 and there's no pause
01:28:40 so every time you do your items
01:28:42 you have to look down and not look at the zombies that are around you
01:28:44 and fiddle with shit
01:28:46 and you can get fucking impacted anytime
01:28:48 bro fatal fucking frame
01:28:50 in fatal frame 3
01:28:52 gamepad as the camera
01:28:54 so you hold it up to the screen
01:28:56 and like take pictures of shit
01:28:58 that's fascinating
01:29:00 they should have made pokemon snap with it
01:29:02 oh my god what were they thinking
01:29:04 I've been screaming about that
01:29:06 ever since the fucking Wii U came out
01:29:08 how was there no fucking
01:29:10 pokemon snap it was bullshit
01:29:12 that's a big oof for me lads
01:29:14 that's a big gomen aside from Nintendo
01:29:16 if there ever was one
01:29:18 I don't know if we'll ever get another pokemon snap
01:29:20 the switch could still do it
01:29:22 turn the switch around
01:29:24 do they have a camera?
01:29:26 I don't know
01:29:28 you just hold it up and spin around
01:29:30 oh yeah
01:29:32 kinda works
01:29:34 I have a video that will probably come up before this podcast
01:29:36 it's about how they need to bring back pokemon puzzle challenge as well
01:29:38 fuck yeah
01:29:40 shit
01:29:42 alright well that's enough about all this shit
01:29:44 I forgot to mention
01:29:46 something that happened to me this week
01:29:48 was me getting trolled
01:29:50 oh no
01:29:52 is that that video
01:29:54 oh yeah I saw that shit
01:29:56 it's on twitch
01:29:58 I clipped it
01:30:00 the video is called
01:30:02 ben saint gets epically trolled by ween CWC
01:30:04 defenders
01:30:06 and it was just a bizarre interaction I had
01:30:08 I was on twitch doing my stream
01:30:10 doing a draw stream for the nightstar comic
01:30:12 and these kids
01:30:14 start messaging me on discord
01:30:16 and they assume they're kids
01:30:18 and they're saying like
01:30:20 hey I got some interesting stuff to tell you
01:30:22 and I say in the stream
01:30:24 like what are these guys doing
01:30:26 these creepy messages
01:30:28 and they give me a call and I decide to talk to them on stream
01:30:30 and it turns out
01:30:32 these are like three guys
01:30:34 and this one autistic girl
01:30:36 who later turns out is being blackmailed
01:30:38 to go along with them
01:30:40 she joins the rfck and she says
01:30:42 these guys aren't my friends
01:30:44 they're really blackmailing me
01:30:46 threatening to dox me and stuff
01:30:48 and these guys they get in
01:30:50 they get in my call and I'm like
01:30:52 hey guys what's up and they tell me
01:30:54 you better stop talking to Chris
01:30:56 she's our fucking mark
01:30:58 they keep pretending
01:31:00 they're her real friends
01:31:02 and I'm muscling in on it
01:31:04 but they're talking like they're mafiosos
01:31:06 they have this weird affective importance
01:31:08 they threaten me
01:31:10 they say we'll be keeping an eye on you
01:31:12 now that you're interacting with Chris
01:31:14 they say don't touch the poop
01:31:16 don't touch the poop
01:31:18 they say chris is their friend
01:31:20 but they're like don't touch the poop
01:31:22 because like
01:31:24 they keep misgendering chris
01:31:26 and I'm like hey you guys should use
01:31:28 the pronoun she asked for
01:31:30 and they're like no me and him have an understanding
01:31:32 these are like some
01:31:34 nonsense
01:31:36 they're obviously not chris's friends
01:31:38 they're obviously some shitty trolls
01:31:40 they fucking and then after the call
01:31:42 they keep messaging me they're like threatening me
01:31:44 to dox me
01:31:46 they went into rfck
01:31:48 and like literally doxed me
01:31:50 but like nobody cared and
01:31:52 that's like the weirdest place to dox me in
01:31:54 who would do anything
01:31:56 so they do that
01:31:58 and I don't know
01:32:00 it was fucking bizarre
01:32:02 I don't know what's going on with these dudes
01:32:04 you're tapping into some primal forces
01:32:06 some realms
01:32:08 I don't understand I suppose
01:32:10 I mean this is a big league
01:32:12 lol cow chris
01:32:14 yeah I guess so
01:32:16 it was so strange listening to them
01:32:18 cause there was parts where
01:32:20 they were implying like
01:32:22 don't hurt our friend
01:32:24 but also like if you do
01:32:26 you may as well make it entertaining for us
01:32:28 they were not on
01:32:30 one person was like hey don't be mean to chris
01:32:32 the other was straight up like make it entertaining
01:32:34 you need to make this entertaining for us
01:32:36 they were not
01:32:38 you better
01:32:40 like deliver
01:32:42 with that comic cause there's a lot of more people
01:32:44 watching it now
01:32:46 things like that it was just really funny
01:32:48 it was funny
01:32:50 yeah we'll be in touch
01:32:52 we'll all be watching you
01:32:54 I believe this is anonymous and they do not forgive
01:32:56 and they do not forgive
01:32:58 they claim to be from kiwi farms
01:33:00 I saw a couple people talking about
01:33:02 the incident on kiwi farms
01:33:04 the overwhelming response was
01:33:06 yeah these guys are embarrassing
01:33:10 it was just bemusement
01:33:12 it doesn't strike me there's a lot of solidarity
01:33:14 among the kiwi farms
01:33:16 like any one of these
01:33:18 troll people who extends above
01:33:20 who raises their head above the crowd
01:33:22 just knowing the kiwi farms a little bit
01:33:24 I expect them to be struck down
01:33:26 what makes you so special sir
01:33:28 if you actually cared about kiwi farms
01:33:30 for whatever reason
01:33:32 yeah I know but if you were a troll
01:33:34 and you're like I'm on behalf of kiwi farms
01:33:36 I will strike a blow against the enemy
01:33:38 you wouldn't show up and be like
01:33:40 hey so I'm here on behalf of kiwi farms
01:33:42 to say fuck you
01:33:44 yeah
01:33:46 did you have a kiwi farms thread about you
01:33:48 no
01:33:50 probably will soon at this point
01:33:52 I'm lately because of the nightstar comic
01:33:54 I've been brought up a bit
01:33:56 in the Chris Chan thread
01:33:58 and there is like an old super thread
01:34:00 there are tons who talk about Chris online
01:34:02 which I am like my video is mentioned in
01:34:04 but I don't have like a
01:34:06 a thread about me
01:34:08 I think like a lot of the PCP
01:34:10 shit talk it's just rolled into my thread
01:34:12 I think so
01:34:14 probably because I have a big ass thread
01:34:16 think of the PCP as Digi Bro's podcast
01:34:18 about anime exclusively
01:34:20 if you're on the outside looking in
01:34:22 that's probably how it looks
01:34:24 I don't think anybody is under the illusion
01:34:26 that this is a podcast about anime at this point
01:34:28 maybe people who have like never
01:34:30 or just heard about it for the first time
01:34:32 and are like oh a podcast
01:34:34 that Digi Bro's on
01:34:36 the less information you know
01:34:38 the more likely you are to think it's Digi Bro's podcast about anime
01:34:40 I mean the thing is I don't really promote
01:34:42 the PCP anymore so like whatever
01:34:44 growth it has is from people
01:34:46 if new people are coming
01:34:48 from me they would have to really
01:34:50 like get into like the discord
01:34:52 and like find out
01:34:54 about you guys before they were gonna know
01:34:56 the podcast and like I do have people in there
01:34:58 who are like oh yeah I've listened to PCP
01:35:00 but I've never even like watched any of
01:35:02 certain people's videos
01:35:04 usually there's one or two people they have though
01:35:06 it'll be like oh I'm a huge fan
01:35:08 of you and give and take and I don't watch
01:35:10 nobody else in that motherfucking thing
01:35:12 and I'm tired of hearing Ben's fucking ass
01:35:14 and talking about politics
01:35:16 and then
01:35:18 classic line
01:35:20 and like I think that there's
01:35:22 I think like there's two general camps
01:35:24 like I do think that
01:35:26 still to this day a bulk of PCP
01:35:28 fans
01:35:30 were at the very least have been
01:35:32 my fans at some point
01:35:34 like you know like
01:35:36 whether they necessarily came from me or not
01:35:38 like I think there's not
01:35:40 a ton of people who are like huge PCP fans
01:35:42 who don't like Digi Bro shit at all
01:35:44 I mean there is a contingent of people who have been around
01:35:46 since the pony days
01:35:48 but I also think that like
01:35:50 there's certain like there's a lot
01:35:52 of people who are much more into
01:35:54 endless war than they are into
01:35:56 you know my shit or anybody else
01:35:58 the endless war subgroup
01:36:00 is like a weird it's
01:36:02 they squeeze took the PCP
01:36:04 fan base squeezed it and a little
01:36:06 like tumor protrusion like squeezed
01:36:08 out to the side and that's
01:36:10 the endless war people
01:36:12 it's a double edged sword in a way because
01:36:14 the double edged of the the endless war
01:36:16 people are probably like the most engaged
01:36:18 with the PCP because of the fact that
01:36:20 several of us are in it
01:36:22 and they come to the meetups and stuff like that
01:36:24 and like often times again a lot
01:36:26 of them are also fans of all of our content
01:36:28 anyways because they found endless war through
01:36:30 the PCP so it's like
01:36:32 they're endless war fans and PCP fans
01:36:34 cool those people are very supportive
01:36:36 and they give us a lot of money and stuff like that
01:36:38 but like I mean it also
01:36:40 does make the podcast harder to penetrate
01:36:42 for if we did want new people
01:36:44 so it's like it's
01:36:46 like the favorite thing of people who are
01:36:48 deep lore but if you were to
01:36:50 go listen like I've often said
01:36:52 if you were to just like put on a random
01:36:54 PCP episode from recent times
01:36:56 it really depends on what the topics happen
01:36:58 to be like this episode probably fairly
01:37:00 accessible but like if you
01:37:02 didn't know who any of us are you've never heard of
01:37:04 endless war you literally have no idea what we're talking
01:37:06 about right now you know that's right and
01:37:08 like there's definitely episodes that start off
01:37:10 with like the one where you guys talked
01:37:12 about the meetup in
01:37:14 London I think yeah
01:37:16 there was one about that
01:37:18 it would have been totally incomprehensible
01:37:20 to anybody who didn't have like at least a modicum
01:37:22 of knowledge how hardcore you have to be
01:37:24 make like a playlist of like
01:37:26 the basic bitch ones
01:37:28 like a scoville rating
01:37:30 I've got good news
01:37:32 for everyone because what could be more
01:37:34 accessible than a simple five dollar pledge
01:37:36 to join the PCP
01:37:38 Minecraft heads and our new
01:37:40 faction that will absolutely dethrone the
01:37:42 RFCK fuck boys
01:37:44 if that happens because I'm also
01:37:46 definitely not going to play Minecraft
01:37:48 so like
01:37:50 that would just be another sphere where I would
01:37:52 just be like oh Nate and Maj are talking
01:37:54 about Minecraft shit now
01:37:56 Munchie and Ben are talking about ready fuckers cop
01:37:58 killers Nate and Maj are talking about
01:38:00 Minecraft
01:38:02 Tom Gibber talking about their comics
01:38:04 you guys are talking about potty cast
01:38:06 and I'm just talking about my
01:38:08 latest research into the world of autism
01:38:10 and that's all I've got
01:38:12 seems pretty good
01:38:14 it's kind of a cool mix I kind of like it
01:38:16 it's like you guys want to hear my latest research
01:38:18 into the world of autism yeah man
01:38:20 lay it on I've come up okay
01:38:22 I've come up with an autism rating scale
01:38:24 right
01:38:26 there are seven
01:38:28 seven different levels of autism
01:38:30 present on the internet
01:38:32 and I can categorize them by the kind
01:38:34 of stuff that they like
01:38:36 I'm planning to make a video where I'm going to do
01:38:38 just anime like like an anime
01:38:40 autism chart like how autistic is
01:38:42 this anime
01:38:44 and like grade everything
01:38:46 so there's basically
01:38:48 how autistic you are comes down to how obsessed
01:38:50 you are with things on like
01:38:52 a systemic level
01:38:54 like how
01:38:56 how much like detail and complication
01:38:58 you either
01:39:00 require there to be for you to enjoy something
01:39:02 or that you yourself read into
01:39:04 the things you enjoy
01:39:06 and there's different sliding scales
01:39:08 like different shows of different intelligence
01:39:10 levels which contributes to people's
01:39:12 ability to enjoy them and generally
01:39:14 you can enjoy
01:39:16 like if you're a level one autistic you can
01:39:18 probably enjoy things going down to level
01:39:20 three autism but any more
01:39:22 autistic than that and it becomes harder for you to
01:39:24 enjoy I see
01:39:26 but there are some people who are like autistic
01:39:28 authors who can project like they can
01:39:30 make stories that are less autistic than
01:39:32 themselves so for instance
01:39:34 Quentin Tarantino probably a level
01:39:36 three or four autistic but he makes
01:39:38 level two autism works
01:39:40 so Quentin Tarantino movies level
01:39:42 two autism generally
01:39:44 even the general public can appreciate
01:39:46 something as low as level two autism
01:39:48 that's like not so autistic
01:39:50 as to be for voting
01:39:52 to the average general population
01:39:54 is everything on the autistic spectrum
01:39:56 or is there non-autistic
01:39:58 work
01:40:00 there is non-autistic work all
01:40:02 anime is at least level one autism
01:40:04 there is no way to watch anime
01:40:06 with no autism
01:40:08 to get a sense of scale is somebody like
01:40:10 Ulillia like a seven
01:40:12 he is a six
01:40:14 on this scale
01:40:16 the new story teller
01:40:18 is a seven
01:40:20 so the way the scale goes
01:40:22 is basically like this level one autism
01:40:24 is basically where
01:40:26 the reason that you're
01:40:28 into anime
01:40:30 Dragon Ball Z is a level one autism show
01:40:32 because the autistic elements
01:40:34 of it are like the power levels
01:40:36 and the fact that it's like a super long
01:40:38 form narrative with a large cast
01:40:40 so like there's things to keep
01:40:42 track of but
01:40:44 if you are like really into keeping track
01:40:46 of things you'll quickly realize that
01:40:48 there's tons of plot holes and ass
01:40:50 poles and retcons and just
01:40:52 the story doesn't seem to care enough about itself
01:40:54 so if you're like autistic enough to
01:40:56 really care about that shit or intelligent
01:40:58 enough because those are also like
01:41:00 elements of the intelligence and construction
01:41:02 I'm planning to make a chart for like
01:41:04 basically each show will have an autism
01:41:06 level and intelligence level
01:41:08 um
01:41:10 whether it appeals to masculine or feminine
01:41:12 where do these charts
01:41:14 where do these charts appear on the scale
01:41:18 the good question the charts themselves they gotta
01:41:20 be pretty high on it
01:41:22 the charts themselves are like level three
01:41:24 to borderline on level four autism
01:41:26 which is where I sit
01:41:28 I'm like a little bit more than level three
01:41:30 but like going down
01:41:32 to level four which is the Evangelion tier
01:41:34 is level three autism
01:41:36 and so basically depending on what tier you're on
01:41:38 it is most likely that
01:41:40 the things that are on that tier
01:41:42 will be your absolute favorite things
01:41:44 like even if you find flaws
01:41:46 in them because they are like perfectly
01:41:48 on your autism wavelength
01:41:50 it's like this is my favorite thing
01:41:52 you know so for instance
01:41:54 something that I would put in between level one
01:41:56 and level two autism is
01:41:58 one piece
01:42:00 one piece gets more into level two
01:42:02 because of the sheer amount of shit that there is
01:42:04 to keep track of if you're keeping track of all of it
01:42:06 you don't have to keep track of all of it to enjoy
01:42:08 the show so it can appeal to more normie
01:42:10 taste as well but
01:42:12 people like Nate who I would consider to be
01:42:14 a level two autism
01:42:16 are into it for the level two autism
01:42:18 reasons I as a level three autism
01:42:20 am into stuff like Eva
01:42:22 that has more of a meta
01:42:24 more into the meta outside of the work itself
01:42:26 like the involvement
01:42:28 of it's place in history
01:42:30 the people who created it
01:42:32 comment on itself as a work
01:42:34 you know stuff like
01:42:36 Homestuck level three autism
01:42:38 and like even if you are
01:42:40 level two you could
01:42:42 a level three autism thing might be your favorite thing
01:42:44 if it's just so good
01:42:46 and like you're like yeah I might not be
01:42:48 quite autistic enough to love everything about this
01:42:50 but it's so fucking good
01:42:52 I have a question then
01:42:54 cause like I'm super
01:42:56 into Homestuck in every aspect
01:42:58 like I'm a big Homestuck autism
01:43:00 but like I can also
01:43:02 look over the things that Nate can't
01:43:04 look over in one piece which is less
01:43:06 how's that work
01:43:08 I think that
01:43:10 the different people have different
01:43:12 priorities in what they think makes
01:43:14 the story good or bad I think that
01:43:16 like the level two autism
01:43:18 I consider to be okay so here's
01:43:20 there's interesting things that happen as we go down
01:43:22 the autistic spectrum because
01:43:24 on the one hand the lower you go
01:43:26 the more like broad and ridiculous
01:43:28 the systems of the story
01:43:30 become but also
01:43:32 you care less and less about it being
01:43:34 good like in air quotes
01:43:36 like people at like
01:43:38 level one and two
01:43:40 probably care the most about everything
01:43:42 like being functional
01:43:44 like they want
01:43:46 to be believable in the end
01:43:48 like you know like JoJo's
01:43:50 Bizarre Adventure is a perfect example of a show
01:43:52 that like people enjoy because
01:43:54 it seems logical
01:43:56 even if everything happening is bad
01:43:58 no it's not at all and it's totally
01:44:00 riddled with mistakes
01:44:02 so I would put that at like level
01:44:04 1.5 autism
01:44:06 like it's got tons of shit for you
01:44:08 to sink your teeth into if you like the deeper stuff
01:44:10 but it doesn't do quite
01:44:12 a good enough job to satisfy
01:44:14 a level two autism who wants everything to be
01:44:16 like dotted every i, cross every t
01:44:18 but when you get to level 3
01:44:20 it's where you kind of enjoy the chaos
01:44:22 more than the order
01:44:24 it's like you don't even care as much
01:44:26 about it answering all of its questions
01:44:28 if it has just as much to say as possible
01:44:30 like Evan Gellion
01:44:32 certainly doesn't answer every single
01:44:34 question it raises
01:44:36 but like it just has so much
01:44:38 shit in it you know there's so much to take in
01:44:40 and there's so much meta
01:44:42 layering to it there's so much to like
01:44:44 enjoy after the fact that it adds to it
01:44:46 for you know the level 3
01:44:48 autism but when you get to level 4
01:44:50 that's when you get to like mega franchises
01:44:52 and where there's like just huge
01:44:54 databases like Gundam perhaps
01:44:56 like fate
01:44:58 like the fate franchise
01:45:00 like where you have to consume all this
01:45:02 any like deep lore of a major
01:45:04 franchise like Star Wars lore
01:45:06 Star Trek lore like if you're reading
01:45:08 the tie-in novels and shit that is level
01:45:10 4 autism
01:45:12 if you're playing like more
01:45:14 mainstream visual novels
01:45:16 that's around here
01:45:18 but then you get to level 5 autism
01:45:20 and this is where you get to like the more
01:45:22 obscure visual novels the people
01:45:24 who are just consuming like
01:45:26 everything because they categorically need
01:45:28 to have seen everything
01:45:30 sounds like you with anime
01:45:32 well there's I also
01:45:34 want to clarify that there's a difference
01:45:36 if you do things as a stunt or in order
01:45:38 to talk about it because like
01:45:40 I will watch shows that I
01:45:42 not necessarily going to enjoy because it has
01:45:44 a like career benefit to me
01:45:46 so like there's some kind of
01:45:48 there's some kind of pride tangled up
01:45:50 in that but like there are
01:45:52 shows that are
01:45:54 just like too dense for me to fucking
01:45:56 wrap my head around have you ever heard of horizon on the middle of nowhere
01:45:58 don't think so
01:46:00 horizon on the middle of nowhere is the most
01:46:02 like over the top with like
01:46:04 having just dozens and dozens of
01:46:06 characters who all belong to different factions
01:46:08 who all have different races and powers
01:46:10 and like different fucking magic
01:46:12 systems and like it's so
01:46:14 fucking dense and complex that there's like
01:46:16 it's a light novel that's like
01:46:18 600 pages in the first
01:46:20 book it has a huge index
01:46:22 just to keep track of what the fuck is going on
01:46:24 I tried to watch the anime couldn't comprehend it
01:46:26 so that's what I consider level 5 autism
01:46:28 level 6 autism something
01:46:30 happens we cross the
01:46:32 warning
01:46:34 we're losing functionality
01:46:36 we're losing functionality
01:46:38 so
01:46:40 when we get to level 6
01:46:42 then
01:46:44 there's two different directions that level 6
01:46:46 autism will take things either
01:46:48 they're very strident
01:46:50 about staying within the canon
01:46:52 and therefore they have
01:46:54 found an unimaginable depth
01:46:56 in every element of the canon
01:46:58 this is where we get the people who are upset about them
01:47:00 putting like taking sonic's gloves away
01:47:02 like because
01:47:04 they've put they've ascribed a ton of meaning to sonic's gloves
01:47:06 because they're obsessed with sonic and like
01:47:08 every part of the canon matters
01:47:10 sonic
01:47:12 by the way sonic meta is level 6 autism
01:47:14 tifa's tips are
01:47:16 3 centimeters too small in the remake
01:47:18 and I will not stand for this this is unacceptable
01:47:20 her bra should not be
01:47:22 exposed okay alright got it
01:47:24 but then there's the other route
01:47:26 that they might take which is
01:47:28 if they don't care about the existing canon
01:47:30 they're going to pump as much
01:47:32 of their own shit into the canon
01:47:34 as humanly possible
01:47:36 so this is where we get like the extreme fanfic writing
01:47:38 and like I would say fanfics in general
01:47:40 start at level 4 autism
01:47:42 like if you're even
01:47:44 writing a fanfic at all
01:47:46 that's pretty autistic
01:47:48 some people who are maybe
01:47:50 a little bit less autistic are doing it
01:47:52 just as a way to like test their writing skills
01:47:54 you know respectable but like
01:47:56 if you're taking it seriously as like something that has
01:47:58 like its own involved canon
01:48:00 level 4
01:48:02 if you're at level 6 it means
01:48:04 that you are somebody who is
01:48:06 maintaining like a wiki of my little pony
01:48:08 youtubers like
01:48:10 that's level 6 autism it's like
01:48:12 an obsession of level
01:48:14 a level of obsession with the meta of everything
01:48:16 that goes beyond it being good at all
01:48:18 like it doesn't have to be good you just have to be
01:48:20 obsessed with it
01:48:22 and you'll find depth and complexity
01:48:24 in it
01:48:26 like Chris Chan and
01:48:28 Ululila and
01:48:30 I wish I had a sound board right now so I could play
01:48:32 and this is what it means to go even further
01:48:34 beyond
01:48:42 and then level 7
01:48:44 is where we get to
01:48:46 like just functional
01:48:48 enough to use the internet and that's where I put
01:48:50 like the new storyteller where he like
01:48:52 clearly he's not participating
01:48:54 in social media he's not like
01:48:56 he might like read his own comments on youtube
01:48:58 but he posts like 7 videos a day
01:49:00 clearly lives in his parents basement
01:49:02 and he plays with Thomas the Tank Engine toys
01:49:04 like that is the that's as autistic
01:49:06 as you can get before you're not really
01:49:08 consuming media anymore you are not
01:49:10 functioning highly enough for that so like
01:49:12 it could be that autism continues past
01:49:14 level 7 I don't know how far it goes but
01:49:16 like any further than that and I can't
01:49:18 ascribe a show to it you know
01:49:20 sure okay so that's my 7
01:49:22 layers of autism and then the other scales
01:49:24 that you have to grade on it's like so each show
01:49:26 will have an autism rating and then
01:49:28 an intelligence level rating
01:49:30 and so like people who are intelligent
01:49:32 across the board might
01:49:34 enjoy things from different categories
01:49:36 and I'll also make side
01:49:38 notes about things like Astro Boy or like the
01:49:40 works of Osama Tezuka I think Tezuka
01:49:42 was himself a level 5
01:49:44 autistic but all of his work is like level
01:49:46 2 or 3 autism you know
01:49:48 although he has some obscure works that go
01:49:50 truly into the depths he has some stuff
01:49:52 that's more autistic than I think even he is
01:49:54 just because he was curious about it you know
01:49:56 because he wrote like a thousand
01:49:58 manga he wrote lots of shit
01:50:00 on the side
01:50:02 but yeah so that's the intelligence
01:50:04 category you might like
01:50:06 the reason that normies who are really
01:50:08 smart can enjoy Tarantino movies
01:50:10 is like they're not as attracted
01:50:12 to just the meta element like level
01:50:14 2 autists they just like the movies because
01:50:16 they're out of order and it gives you a lot of shit to keep track
01:50:18 of you know yeah like
01:50:20 normies who are smart are just like oh
01:50:22 intelligent writing good characterization
01:50:24 you know but like they're not as
01:50:26 interested in it as like fetishistically
01:50:28 as like a autist
01:50:30 is you know so then we've got
01:50:32 the masculine versus feminine
01:50:34 rating because this makes a difference as well like
01:50:36 just how masculine
01:50:38 or feminine you you conceive yourself to be
01:50:40 like what you enjoy out of works
01:50:42 you know if you
01:50:44 are more of a dude bro you're gonna like
01:50:46 more dude bro kind of shows and I did not expect
01:50:48 a Z axis to be added to this
01:50:50 oh there's another axis because there's gonna be
01:50:52 two different charts
01:50:54 one is the autism versus intelligence
01:50:56 so like there'll be
01:50:58 one chart of like the autism level and intelligence level
01:51:00 and then another chart of the
01:51:02 male versus female
01:51:04 as well as
01:51:06 masculine feminine
01:51:08 to be politically correct
01:51:10 I fall
01:51:12 you know like barely into the masculine
01:51:14 side I would say like lots of really feminine stuff
01:51:16 you know but there's also
01:51:18 the
01:51:20 the emotional
01:51:22 thinker versus
01:51:24 what was the word I wanted to use
01:51:26 pragmatic
01:51:28 that's a good word yeah pragmatic
01:51:30 thinker because there are
01:51:32 a lot of shows are beloved because
01:51:34 of the fact that they just have lots of information
01:51:36 in them and like I think
01:51:38 of Ben as maybe somebody
01:51:40 who likes a lot of the pragmatism
01:51:42 and shows a lot of like oh they set up this
01:51:44 really interesting rule system you know and
01:51:46 like and it says it
01:51:48 it's built out of like realistic
01:51:50 concepts and stuff like that like
01:51:52 um I think of something
01:51:54 like that no game no life scene
01:51:56 where he removes columns force from the universe
01:51:58 appeals to like the pragmatic
01:52:00 thinker who's like oh wow science
01:52:02 used in storytelling cool you know
01:52:04 whereas like emotional
01:52:06 good idea even though the execution doesn't make
01:52:08 any fucking right
01:52:10 yeah and uh and maybe you're too pragmatic
01:52:12 for it maybe it's like a little too emotional
01:52:14 or something but like
01:52:16 emotional thinkers are people who more
01:52:18 like don't really care about the logic of it
01:52:20 as much as you know whatever it makes them
01:52:22 feel so like that would be the other axis
01:52:24 I'm gonna I think I could apply
01:52:26 this to every anime I know of I think
01:52:28 I could make a reasonable deduction
01:52:30 of how autistic is it if anybody wants
01:52:32 if you have any questions any anime
01:52:34 you want me to put through the test I could
01:52:36 give you my quadrants
01:52:38 of what I think it falls into does anybody have
01:52:40 a suggestion
01:52:42 well I'm just on that last
01:52:44 I haven't seen double-decker
01:52:46 I'm comparing two series that are I think pretty smart
01:52:48 but like Technolize is probably
01:52:50 extremely emotionally based and then
01:52:52 versus like Ghost in the Shell extremely
01:52:54 like intellectual brain based
01:52:56 yeah you know I would say that
01:52:58 Technolize is definitely
01:53:00 more emotional but like
01:53:02 it does have a lot of interesting
01:53:04 it has a lot of like weird sci-fi
01:53:06 concepts that come out later in the show
01:53:08 so like you'd have to have some interest in
01:53:10 sci-fi to like get the most out of it and like
01:53:12 but yeah I would definitely
01:53:14 say it's more of like a feeling
01:53:16 kind of show it's more of
01:53:18 driven by that for sure
01:53:20 you know what's a good example of this
01:53:22 fucking Space Patrol Luluko
01:53:24 that's like pure emotion like no logic
01:53:26 Luluko I would put on like level 3
01:53:28 autism because it's so
01:53:30 so much of it is obsessed with the meta of itself
01:53:32 of its own existence you know that like
01:53:34 incorporates elements from all the other trigger shows
01:53:36 and it's like none of that shit even means anything
01:53:38 to you unless you've seen all these fucking shows
01:53:40 so you know it's
01:53:42 it's fairly autistic but
01:53:44 it's also like definitely way
01:53:46 more emotional thinker than logical thinker
01:53:48 because none of it really makes any sense or tries to answer
01:53:50 its own questions it's just pure over the top
01:53:52 you know teen
01:53:54 angst and emotions are what
01:53:56 controls the story you know
01:53:58 so like emotional thinking
01:54:00 probably right in the like
01:54:02 on the line between masculine and feminine I think
01:54:04 it tries to appeal to both
01:54:06 yeah I agree in equal measure
01:54:08 and intelligence level
01:54:10 I would say is like
01:54:12 just above average not like
01:54:14 high but you know like
01:54:16 yeah it plays around with some
01:54:18 concepts and it moves really fast
01:54:20 so it doesn't try to like hold your hand
01:54:22 and walk you through everything but like
01:54:24 yeah so that's my rating level 3
01:54:26 autism slightly above
01:54:28 average intelligence
01:54:30 right in the middle between masculine and feminine
01:54:32 and
01:54:34 what was the other paradigm I had
01:54:36 emotionally like yeah much more emotional
01:54:38 than rational
01:54:40 or what the fuck was that
01:54:42 pragmatic yes
01:54:44 psychopaths I would say is like
01:54:46 psychopaths isn't very
01:54:48 autistic at all actually it's
01:54:50 pretty straightforward you know
01:54:52 like well another
01:54:54 thing I put at like level like 1.5
01:54:56 to 2 is like shows that
01:54:58 play around with
01:55:00 like real world theming stuff like
01:55:02 Star Trek where like it has application
01:55:04 to real life because that's meta in a
01:55:06 sense like if that's what you care about
01:55:08 about it which I think people who like
01:55:10 psychopaths would appreciate that
01:55:12 you know like there's not a ton
01:55:14 to keep track of the complications in the story
01:55:16 but it does make a lot of like literary references
01:55:18 it does like
01:55:20 you know reference other movies
01:55:22 and you know sort of
01:55:24 expound on the
01:55:26 conversation through media about the future
01:55:28 so like in that sense I would say it's like level 2 autism
01:55:30 a series that has
01:55:32 tons of references should definitely
01:55:34 like that should inch up the autism
01:55:36 like significantly and like maybe the
01:55:38 intelligence a bit but like it's just a
01:55:40 reference that doesn't do anything that smart
01:55:42 can you give me an example of a level 0
01:55:44 autistic work
01:55:46 um ooh
01:55:48 a marvel movie
01:55:50 any marvel any like
01:55:52 disney marvel movie those are
01:55:54 crunchy lore and those have like lots
01:55:56 of references to an extended canon though
01:55:58 they okay maybe iron man one
01:56:00 I would say that those movies
01:56:02 they can appeal to both
01:56:04 like they're made to market to both
01:56:06 oh uh yeah
01:56:08 I was just reminded by May writing it down
01:56:10 sports is a
01:56:12 depending on your level of engagement
01:56:14 I mean if you're into
01:56:16 like a fucking saver metrics and stuff
01:56:18 if you get into like
01:56:20 fantasy football that's like
01:56:22 at least level 2 or 3 autism
01:56:24 yeah I feel like this this
01:56:26 chart is not like where would you put
01:56:28 the thing but like
01:56:30 for the people who are in these brackets
01:56:32 what could you recommend to them
01:56:34 level 0 autism is
01:56:36 the article in the mag the article
01:56:38 in the magazine that you see in the grocery
01:56:40 store saying that you know
01:56:42 brad and fucking angelina
01:56:44 are back together again
01:56:46 well if I present
01:56:48 this whole thing something I want to
01:56:50 clarify is like people
01:56:52 anywhere on the spectrum can enjoy stuff
01:56:54 that I would categorize as anywhere on the
01:56:56 spectrum depending on how they engage with
01:56:58 it so like for instance may was
01:57:00 telling like telling me about warrior
01:57:02 cats right and like the warrior cats
01:57:04 books are meant to just be
01:57:06 like children's books they're
01:57:08 kind of autistic you know like
01:57:10 they have a lot of factions and like
01:57:12 relationships and stuff to keep track of
01:57:14 a lot of characters but like generally
01:57:16 they're kids books you know
01:57:18 but there was a heavy online
01:57:20 community for warrior cats and like
01:57:22 a lot of them like it because they're
01:57:24 furries or just into like animal
01:57:26 project projecting themselves on the animal
01:57:28 characters or they're like
01:57:30 really intent on keeping track of all
01:57:32 the factions and like creating
01:57:34 you know diagrams creating their own
01:57:36 fan content and animations and fan
01:57:38 fictions making up their own OCs and like
01:57:40 the more of that you get into the more
01:57:42 autistic it becomes the more it's like
01:57:44 you're trying to take this
01:57:46 story and make it more complex
01:57:48 make it have more to offer
01:57:50 because you like the aesthetic
01:57:52 elements of it or maybe you just haven't
01:57:54 seen stuff that would appeal to your level
01:57:56 of autism like maybe there's something
01:57:58 that if you knew about it
01:58:00 you wouldn't have to you know
01:58:02 obsess over warrior cats but you're 13
01:58:04 and it's you know it's
01:58:06 put in front of you so that's just what
01:58:08 you apply your autism to. So there's a
01:58:10 distinction to be made obviously between any
01:58:12 individual consumer and the work itself
01:58:14 to be on totally different pages. Exactly
01:58:16 but I do think that there's
01:58:18 a like I think there's a limit to
01:58:20 how far out of somebody's autism
01:58:22 range they'll generally tend towards
01:58:24 and like what
01:58:26 made me think about this whole chart
01:58:28 like my placement of everything had to do
01:58:30 with the fact that I think
01:58:32 I'm in a position
01:58:34 where I'm like in the middle ground on almost
01:58:36 all of these statistics like by
01:58:38 being like level three autism
01:58:40 I can appreciate level one shit
01:58:42 I can appreciate level five shit
01:58:44 it has to get to level six
01:58:46 it has to get to the level of like appreciating
01:58:48 bad sonic games because you
01:58:50 can't tell the difference that's where it's like
01:58:52 too autistic for me you know
01:58:54 that's pretty far gone most
01:58:56 people aren't that autistic so like
01:58:58 I'm in a good acceptable range to talk about a lot
01:59:00 of different shit and appreciate it you know
01:59:02 and being like
01:59:04 the hardest thing for me to
01:59:06 appreciate is just really dumb shit you know
01:59:08 regardless of its autism level if it's not
01:59:10 intelligently constructed that's the hardest
01:59:12 thing for me to pass you know
01:59:14 but like anything else I'm like right in the middle
01:59:16 of pragmatic and emotional I'm right in the middle
01:59:18 of masculine feminine I can appreciate
01:59:20 stuff all over the spectrum
01:59:22 and you know I
01:59:24 from that vantage
01:59:26 point it's like I can look at absolutely everything
01:59:28 and I can say okay
01:59:30 I've seen all this type of show and like
01:59:32 only these types like the same guys who
01:59:34 like JoJo also like
01:59:36 all this other shit that's like the same amount
01:59:38 of autistic you know
01:59:40 except for guys who like it for
01:59:42 really autistic reasons you know
01:59:44 so
01:59:46 that's kind of how I base my ranking
01:59:48 anyway
01:59:50 this will all have possibly
01:59:52 already been explained in a video I have no idea
01:59:54 but now I just wanted you guys to be
01:59:56 in on it because I thought you'd all be interested
01:59:58 I think you'll all you would all be
02:00:00 like looking at stuff
02:00:02 and asking yourself like how autistic is this
02:00:04 I've been doing it constantly like
02:00:06 watching YouTube channels and be like
02:00:08 how autistic is this creator
02:00:10 because like some of them
02:00:12 like there's this guy I don't do not mean
02:00:14 for this to sound like a call out but
02:00:16 I've been watching shit loads
02:00:18 of like gaming reviews and documentaries
02:00:20 and like retrospectives
02:00:22 just tons of game shit
02:00:24 and I stumbled upon this guy called
02:00:26 Ant Dude and
02:00:28 he's like he's
02:00:30 fairly well spoken he does like
02:00:32 in-depth breakdowns of games
02:00:34 that are pretty
02:00:36 you know he addresses most of the stuff
02:00:38 in the game it's fairly in-depth
02:00:40 and enjoyable
02:00:42 his sense of humor is like
02:00:44 pretty much borrowed from like Egoraptor
02:00:46 and John Tron but not like
02:00:48 nearly as impactful as them
02:00:50 he's not like super funny
02:00:52 but like his super in-depth
02:00:54 reviews are of like Kirby and Yoshi
02:00:56 games
02:00:58 and I'm like that's kind of hella autistic
02:01:00 you know
02:01:02 almost everything on his channel is covering
02:01:04 some kind of mascot platformer
02:01:06 and it's like he's really positive
02:01:08 about these games for the most part
02:01:10 he can recognize their flaws
02:01:12 but he doesn't hold them against the games that much
02:01:14 he's like really positive about these games
02:01:16 and I look at it and I think like this is what happens
02:01:18 if you're like really intelligent
02:01:20 but like level 4 autism
02:01:22 you know not to like try to
02:01:24 diagnose this guy or anything I don't even know
02:01:26 if he's autistic I just find his taste
02:01:28 to be like what I would consider to be
02:01:30 in that realm you know
02:01:32 where it's like yeah I just want to look at like
02:01:34 cutesy fun stuff
02:01:36 and like I get enough depth out of analyzing it
02:01:38 that it doesn't have to
02:01:40 actually be that deep
02:01:42 you know
02:01:44 whereas something that's like absurdly deep is like
02:01:46 a dwarf fortress or something
02:01:48 that's like the appeal is that it's
02:01:50 super deep
02:01:52 and you don't have to read anything
02:01:54 into it because it's completely
02:01:56 all there
02:01:58 that would definitely be like
02:02:00 level 3 bordering level 4
02:02:02 autism level is like the games like that
02:02:04 yeah
02:02:06 oh my god do any of you watch the channel called
02:02:08 Seth to Zenrec
02:02:10 I know that guy I've seen some of his stuff
02:02:12 people like him a lot I've been getting into him
02:02:14 he's very demolition de-esque
02:02:16 but even more of like an edgy meme lord
02:02:18 but he plays like Ben
02:02:20 you gotta watch this channel just because
02:02:22 he plays every fucking
02:02:24 one of these like super robust games
02:02:26 like what's his name
02:02:28 Seth to Zenrec
02:02:30 Seth with two S's
02:02:32 if you just type Seth with two S's you'll probably get the channel
02:02:34 oh Seth scene
02:02:36 yeah something like that
02:02:38 yeah
02:02:40 he has like an African warlord as his avatar
02:02:42 like he always like shows that on screen
02:02:44 if it's like him talking
02:02:46 it's very weird aesthetically
02:02:48 but he plays like all the super robust games
02:02:50 and he goes into all the systems and like
02:02:52 why they are so deep
02:02:54 and what kind of crazy shit can you do
02:02:56 in these games
02:02:58 is it like video essays?
02:03:00 I think this is the guy who made
02:03:02 the Heroes of Might Magic 3
02:03:04 review that people kept comparing me to
02:03:06 because it came out at the same time
02:03:08 he's done all of the Heroes of Might Magic games
02:03:10 I think
02:03:12 but he's covered all kinds of stuff
02:03:14 like a lot of classic RPGs
02:03:16 and a lot of like sandbox games
02:03:18 and like usually the main focus of the video
02:03:20 is just showing you how crazy of things
02:03:22 can happen with the systems in this game
02:03:24 you know or like
02:03:26 how broken the game could be
02:03:28 like sometimes he'll play games that he's like
02:03:30 this game's not even good but because of the weirdness
02:03:32 of the mechanics and how broken it is
02:03:34 you can play it in like really entertaining ways
02:03:36 or mod it to be entertaining in ways
02:03:38 you know so
02:03:40 I'm just impressed by the level of depth he plays
02:03:42 the games to before he talks about them
02:03:44 which no other critic fucking does
02:03:46 nobody even touches stuff like Dwarf Fortress
02:03:48 so it's really cool that he's doing it
02:03:50 with fucking need
02:03:52 alright he's a good man
02:03:54 preemptively so
02:03:56 you know what I'm not subscribed to
02:03:58 no I think I am I don't know whatever
02:04:00 for some reason like there is like a wall
02:04:02 I'm like intimidated to get really into his videos
02:04:04 I mean I fucking binge them all the day
02:04:06 pretty much he doesn't have
02:04:08 like even though his channel
02:04:10 goes back farther than like the type
02:04:12 of videos he does now
02:04:14 like initially he was doing more like meme videos
02:04:16 it wasn't quite like serious reviews
02:04:18 over time he'd like somehow
02:04:20 became a reviewer but sometimes
02:04:22 the memers can grow
02:04:24 into the best serious people
02:04:26 because they get those memes in there too
02:04:28 and they just hit the sweet spot
02:04:30 I don't know what this guy does because I haven't watched him but
02:04:32 that's what it seems to be the case
02:04:34 do you want to move on to voicemails?
02:04:36 I think we should
02:04:38 before we go on to voicemails
02:04:40 I wanted to say one thing quickly
02:04:44 I solved a minor inconvenience
02:04:46 of mine that has been plaguing me for years
02:04:48 and I wanted to share it with everyone
02:04:50 on the off chance that you might have had
02:04:52 the exact same problem
02:04:54 and have been subconsciously looking for a solution
02:04:58 one of the veins of my existence
02:05:00 of just using computers
02:05:02 is having tabs
02:05:04 open of
02:05:06 sites I frequently use
02:05:08 and living in constant fear of my browser crashing
02:05:10 or my computer
02:05:12 updating or turning it off and losing all those tabs
02:05:14 that drives me
02:05:16 insane
02:05:18 so my
02:05:20 system before this is that you can pin
02:05:22 tabs and chrome and shit
02:05:24 so you can right click on a tab and pin it
02:05:26 and it'll stay nested in the corner
02:05:28 so you can have an army of all your frequently
02:05:30 used sites
02:05:32 so that's the old
02:05:34 system I had but the problem with that
02:05:36 is that that was originally something from
02:05:38 Max and the max version works great
02:05:40 every time you open the browser it automatically loads
02:05:42 all your tabs that you have pinned
02:05:44 and if you are in a pinned tab
02:05:46 and you go to another site it actually automatically opens
02:05:48 a new tab and keeps your pinned tab there
02:05:50 which is great no other
02:05:52 fucking browser works like that
02:05:54 so the features basically use this on anything that's not a
02:05:56 Mac but
02:05:58 earlier this week I discovered
02:06:00 a feature of chrome
02:06:02 that has solved this problem
02:06:04 completely and has no longer made me
02:06:06 worried about my browser tabs
02:06:08 or losing like or having access to sites that I use all the time
02:06:10 and it's if you're on a website
02:06:12 any website as far as I can tell
02:06:14 and you click the menu
02:06:16 you go to more tools and do create
02:06:18 shortcut it'll pop up and it's like
02:06:20 oh create a shortcut
02:06:22 then you can check off open as window
02:06:24 and when you hit create
02:06:26 it takes that tab and just makes it a web app
02:06:28 like it's in its own container
02:06:30 it's pulled out of the
02:06:32 out of the browser
02:06:34 and it's just you can pin it to your
02:06:36 taskbar and open it just like a regular application
02:06:38 and so you no longer have to
02:06:40 worry about your tabs anymore
02:06:42 they just work just like regular apps
02:06:44 like I have patreon
02:06:46 youtube and twitter all in my
02:06:48 taskbar along with like all my graphic design
02:06:50 apps and blender and game dev engines
02:06:52 and every time I want to use them you just click it
02:06:54 and it just opens up its own dedicated window
02:06:56 it doesn't open it up in your browser it just
02:06:58 runs its own self
02:07:00 contained version of itself
02:07:02 like a native application
02:07:04 and it's the best fucking shit
02:07:06 of all time
02:07:08 okay let me just let me play devil's advocate for a moment
02:07:10 here I see the one downside of this being
02:07:12 that like now that you're you've got this open
02:07:14 is dedicated like I've got the I just did this with
02:07:16 youtube just now but like
02:07:18 now I've lost the ability to like
02:07:20 on the top menu go to another website
02:07:22 while I have this open because it's dedicated to
02:07:24 like just youtube is this is this
02:07:26 correct am I missing anything
02:07:28 no that's it's it's it's it's designed
02:07:30 to run like a application
02:07:32 okay it just runs it in a container
02:07:34 that works like an application
02:07:36 sick the the the benefit
02:07:38 is that again like
02:07:40 you don't have to worry about your browser crashing
02:07:42 your computer updating all these things going away
02:07:44 because they're always in your taskbar like anything else
02:07:46 and it's changed my life
02:07:48 and I'm gonna try it
02:07:50 if you're level 3
02:07:52 computer autistic like I am this is a godsend
02:07:54 so
02:07:56 check check it out
02:07:58 let's try it out and let us know
02:08:00 in the comments if this is making a positive
02:08:02 difference in your life I'm curious how many people
02:08:04 want to use this
02:08:06 I have
02:08:08 I have something I want to say before we go
02:08:10 into voicemails I just want to do a quick update
02:08:12 on the Vapors to Kickstarter
02:08:14 which is that we have smashed all the
02:08:16 stretch goals
02:08:18 and at this moment of recording we're just shy
02:08:20 of eight thousand dollars
02:08:22 and the next stretch goal is ten thousand at which point
02:08:24 pins for
02:08:26 all everybody who is credible
02:08:28 if we hit ten thousand dollars everyone
02:08:30 who has already pledged at fifteen
02:08:32 or higher will just get a free pin
02:08:34 a new pin a third pin it's my heart
02:08:36 st logo black on silver gonna make those
02:08:38 just give them to everybody
02:08:40 fuck it how much time is left in the campaign
02:08:42 when you're listening to this there will be one
02:08:44 week left to donate
02:08:46 there's usually that bump at the very end as people
02:08:48 realize they gotta get it in so this seems
02:08:50 achievable this seems pretty doable I think
02:08:52 so I'm optimistic anyway
02:08:54 kickstarter.com slash project slash
02:08:56 bensane slash papers to link in the description
02:08:58 is the stretch goal that everybody gets
02:09:00 a free pin yes everybody
02:09:02 who has wanted to donate
02:09:04 so I can get a free pin everybody
02:09:06 was for a physical reward at least
02:09:08 if you donated fifteen dollars
02:09:10 say for just the book
02:09:12 and then the
02:09:14 well already you will receive one dollar
02:09:16 in your package because
02:09:18 we hit the stretch goal that everybody gets a dollar
02:09:20 because communism
02:09:22 and then if we hit ten thousand dollars then
02:09:24 you poor
02:09:26 who merely ordered a book before
02:09:28 will then receive the book
02:09:30 the dollar and the
02:09:32 pin just for having contributed
02:09:34 to the cause what is the pin gonna be
02:09:36 it's the my heart logo
02:09:38 Ben shouldn't you demand
02:09:40 I want the infinite chest pin
02:09:42 well you gotta pay you gotta get that one on
02:09:44 its own level that's like 45 bucks
02:09:46 for that one I think no for infinite chest pin
02:09:48 that's the first pin twenty five twenty
02:09:50 twenty five would get you the book and
02:09:52 the infinite chest pin
02:09:54 I paid the amount where I got both comics
02:09:56 just both comics
02:09:58 I got both comics
02:10:00 and the infinite chest pin
02:10:02 45 was the lowest I could do
02:10:04 to get the books and the pins
02:10:06 if you just got the book okay well let me
02:10:08 hold on let me look at the rewards
02:10:10 twenty five would get you
02:10:12 either both books or a book and a pin
02:10:14 if you wanted to get both books
02:10:16 and the pin you'd have to do thirty five
02:10:18 that's how it is
02:10:20 I didn't want to pay an extra ten dollars
02:10:22 because I don't put pins on anything
02:10:24 I just wanted because of the meme of infinite chest
02:10:26 I had a row of pins here
02:10:28 that bring me such joy every day
02:10:30 including my poobah pin and my rad come three
02:10:32 I still have my poobah pin
02:10:34 it's on my laptop bag
02:10:36 this Kickstarter is at least a level
02:10:38 two and a half autism based on
02:10:40 the amount of highly
02:10:42 specific reward tiers and combinations
02:10:44 of things one might
02:10:46 pay very specific amounts of money to achieve
02:10:48 I would generally categorize
02:10:50 both you and Nate into
02:10:52 level two autism
02:10:54 but I definitely think that
02:10:56 that's probably a bit higher than me I guess
02:10:58 I think you both like a lot of stuff
02:11:00 that's outside of your category
02:11:02 just based on how good it is
02:11:04 like I said
02:11:06 really good stuff can transcend
02:11:08 its categorization more easily amongst
02:11:10 intelligent people just because you're like wow
02:11:12 this thing might be really autistic
02:11:14 but it's really interesting
02:11:16 and you might even enjoy ironically some things
02:11:18 like Ulila's book obviously that's like
02:11:20 a level six autism book
02:11:22 but it's fun to read
02:11:24 it's fun
02:11:26 conceptually
02:11:28 I feel like my autism
02:11:30 must spike when I read
02:11:32 something like that because that is not a good
02:11:34 book it is not fun to read
02:11:36 and yet somehow
02:11:38 I can maintain
02:11:40 I can keep myself erect through the entire
02:11:42 process of reading it somehow I can
02:11:44 maintain enough interest that I could get
02:11:46 through it like multiple times
02:11:48 it's even though it's not even there
02:11:50 we move on to voicemail yes
02:11:52 yes indeed let's do that
02:11:54 okay I've got them pulled up right here
02:11:56 okay let me see here we go
02:11:58 okay so everybody of course leave us voicemails
02:12:00 we love them people speakpipe.com
02:12:02 there's a link in the description just go click on that
02:12:04 give us voicemails their quality
02:12:06 perhaps you'll be as as as
02:12:08 lucky enough has skilled enough to get into
02:12:10 the PCP voice grail
02:12:12 or perhaps you'll be degenerate lowly
02:12:14 to be locked away forever in the PCP
02:12:16 jail the voice jail
02:12:18 so it's a real gamble be careful
02:12:20 before you submit how many
02:12:22 how many voicemails we got
02:12:24 I think 10 I think an even 10
02:12:26 okay there's one
02:12:28 just preview thing before
02:12:30 we get to the real voicemails here's the
02:12:32 the proto voicemail what could this one be
02:12:34 about this is called crypto punk
02:12:36 alright let's hear what it has to say go
02:12:38 the dawn
02:12:40 of the PCP minecraft
02:12:42 server yes bring a new
02:12:44 age for those who choose
02:12:46 to mine at night

02:12:52 punk
02:12:54 patreon.com
02:12:56 slash PCP minecraft
02:12:58 people five dollars and get in
02:13:00 the server it's gonna be a blast
02:13:02 I'm hyped that crypto punk
02:13:04 is starting to get some roots
02:13:06 and becoming part of the PCP can
02:13:08 indeed I can't believe
02:13:10 I can't believe you actually made a separate
02:13:12 patreon I'm we did
02:13:14 and believe it really happened
02:13:16 okay alright
02:13:18 now on to the actual voicemails okay here
02:13:20 we go calling in is mickey
02:13:22 mouse in real life has
02:13:24 some things to say let's hear
02:13:26 let's hear them go
02:13:28 oh hey there
02:13:30 procrastinators it's a me
02:13:32 mickey mouse Mario
02:13:34 minis asleep so I can't be too loud
02:13:36 I'm here to discuss possibilities
02:13:38 for an exclusive PCP deal
02:13:40 with disney plus
02:13:42 we love your stuff but we gotta work on that
02:13:44 Ben sainte fella cause he
02:13:46 could be a little dangerous you know
02:13:48 we really can't have him saying
02:13:50 those things he says
02:13:52 and you know Nate I can't guarantee
02:13:54 anything but joining the disney
02:13:56 family could get you in on
02:13:58 well you know
02:14:00 something you're really
02:14:02 you know whoop that's all for now
02:14:04 I gotta go take Pluto for a walk in the
02:14:06 dead of night
02:14:08 getting touched once you've you know
02:14:10 done something about Ben sainte
02:14:16 um yeah I knew he'd have it
02:14:18 out for me
02:14:20 disney money and no more Ben sainte
02:14:22 this sounds like a win-win to me
02:14:24 yeah I gotta agree where's the downside I ask
02:14:26 where's the downside
02:14:28 well it's been fun
02:14:30 alright as Charlie mickey mouse
02:14:32 and his cohorts live as opposed to communist hell
02:14:34 in capitalist heaven and that's where I
02:14:36 aspire to be eventually
02:14:38 absolutely
02:14:40 they have a direct line to capitalist god
02:14:42 and they're definitely under the
02:14:44 under the
02:14:46 under the purview of you know emperor matthew
02:14:48 is from final fantasy 2 with his administrative
02:14:50 powers operating this whole thing
02:14:52 you know like clockwork
02:14:54 um okay let's go to the next one
02:14:56 uh this is uh
02:14:58 grailers and jailers
02:15:00 okay uh get to it
02:15:02 I gotta say I'm really
02:15:04 tired of this jail
02:15:06 grail shenanigans
02:15:08 I gotta say
02:15:10 it's cool people have been
02:15:12 submitting more quality
02:15:14 voicemails but this shit is
02:15:16 insane it doesn't matter
02:15:18 it's up to the PCP man
02:15:20 it doesn't
02:15:22 matter if you send in
02:15:24 six quality voicemails
02:15:26 in a row and they all get played and everyone
02:15:28 laughs it doesn't matter
02:15:30 you guys need to do something epic
02:15:32 you can't
02:15:34 pander and make all these
02:15:36 retarded ironic
02:15:38 memes like you got
02:15:40 put in the grail and then
02:15:42 you immediately dropped your spot
02:15:44 retarded

02:16:26 if you ask me
02:16:28 100% agree

02:17:12 is he under the bed?
02:17:14 he has not played them
02:17:16 I tried to make them funny
02:17:18 I tried to have a good meme
02:17:20 make it so maybe they would laugh
02:17:22 is he just speaking through a toilet roll
02:17:24 it's suppressed
02:17:26 it's not helping your odds

02:17:38 were they equally as quality as this voicemail
02:17:40 and you wonder why they weren't playing
02:17:42 sounds like it's playing from the other
02:17:44 side of the wall
02:17:46 I think he's literally just like cupping his hands
02:17:48 cupping his hands over his mouth
02:17:50 sounds like it
02:17:52 as a sort of makeshift voice filter
02:17:54 listen I'm an equal opportunity
02:17:56 there are people who are like yeah fuck
02:17:58 Ben man I'm on Nate's side
02:18:00 and I don't play them either cause they're not funny
02:18:02 cause they're lame just make it good

02:20:08 elu gay samurai
02:20:10 After my disgrace by the digital blow, I have been training for my comeback.
02:20:19 When I finally returned, I am very shocked to see you are playing very racist stereotype on your show.
02:20:31 The Chinese dog, Mao Zedong, is using very racist accent to sound like Japanese.
02:20:43 Chinese don't sound like Xato, it is very rude to me as a Japanese.
02:20:52 I have dedicated myself to finding the way to hell, so I can kill all the communists and restorers to Japan.
02:21:12 Nanking 2 coming soon to communist hell, it's only a matter of time.
02:21:18 Who is the Chinese character that has had a fake Japanese accent?
02:21:24 Chairman Mao has been calling in from communist hell to make nice with the PCP, which we appreciate.
02:21:30 Maybe Eroge Samurai just thinks Japanese sound like shit, maybe that's what he thinks.
02:21:37 I think it's contention.
02:21:38 He thinks Mao Zedong's stupid accent just reminds him it hits too close to home.
02:21:43 Perhaps the demon one is in his own eye all along and needs to do some self-reflection.
02:21:49 Think about Eroge Samurai, leave those good communist boys alone.
02:21:53 They just want justice.
02:21:55 Speaking of communists, we've got Carl Liebknecht at communist hell.
02:22:02 Do you know this guy? I don't know who he is exactly.
02:22:04 I assume he's a communist.
02:22:05 Is that like his email? Carlliebknechtatcommunisthell.edu?
02:22:11 Probably something like that.
02:22:13 Dot gov, of course.
02:22:14 I don't know, he'll tell us about it.
02:22:17 Carl, go.
02:22:18 Hello, this is Carl Liebknecht, the good boy of communist hell.
02:22:21 I'm really just here to spend some time with my comrades.
02:22:24 Anyways, I want to remark that you placing only certain denizens of communist hell in the voice grill
02:22:29 is the best pointless and adverse to counter-revolutionary act.
02:22:32 The ascension of our comrades is the ascension of all the peasants and the proletariat of the world
02:22:37 beyond your artificial stratification.
02:22:39 This, oh god, what was that?
02:22:43 Again, how is this happening here?
02:22:47 Oh man, another classic communist faux pas.
02:22:51 Another comrade falls.
02:22:53 That's alright Carl, just exclamation revive, you'll be fine.
02:22:57 I thought they had gun laws in hell.
02:23:00 They have so many gun laws, it's like, you know, Chicago, you know, politics, et cetera, et cetera.
02:23:06 It's like they say, the only solution to a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,
02:23:10 but there are no good guys with guns.
02:23:12 There are no good guys in communist hell, so it's just bad guys with guns.
02:23:15 By touching a gun, you become a bad guy.
02:23:18 Yeah, and that's how you wind up in communist hell.
02:23:23 Alright, let's move on.
02:23:24 We've got one from Zulfur.
02:23:26 Zulfur, okay, go.
02:23:29 Last week, upon hearing that the virgins are banned from making voicemails,
02:23:33 unless we fuck the PCP, I paused, reflected, and decided I want to sleep with a band.
02:23:40 The only question left is, who do I fuck?
02:23:43 Who do I marry?
02:23:44 And who do I kill?
02:23:46 I think about for a minute, Ben, Munchy, and Nate.
02:23:50 Fuck Nate, because he has 100k subscribers that could blackmail him later.
02:23:54 Did she has more?
02:23:55 Very Munchy, because I can introduce him to my parents without dying of embarrassment.
02:24:00 And kill Ben, because there's problematic egalitarian hate speech.
02:24:05 That's being disguised as far left talking points.
02:24:08 Oh, you can't force Ben.
02:24:10 My body, my body is ready.
02:24:14 This is hate crime.
02:24:18 We gotta cancel this guy right fucking now.
02:24:21 I appreciate him at least respecting our updated system, where no virgins allowed to leave voicemails.
02:24:27 So that's, you know, big appreciation for that.
02:24:30 Yes, yes.
02:24:32 Oh, you know, okay, I knew this day would come.
02:24:35 Everyone's out for me today.
02:24:38 Well, yeah, all the online scrolls, the de-packers.
02:24:44 They know I'm a danger to their precious system.
02:24:50 Indeed.
02:24:51 Okay, we've got another one.
02:24:53 Nate, this one's from, okay.
02:24:56 Nate, you uncultured fuck.
02:24:58 It's de-enverred.
02:25:01 De-enverred.
02:25:02 And again, this is another classified voice.
02:25:04 De-enverred?
02:25:05 He's German.
02:25:06 De-enverred called in last time, but this is de-enverred.
02:25:10 He's calling in.
02:25:11 Have you made a mistake last time?
02:25:13 I don't know.
02:25:14 Okay, anyway, go.
02:25:15 Somewhere in the deepest, darkest reaches of phlogmological space-time.
02:25:22 Go!
02:25:26 There he is.
02:25:27 I made it.
02:25:28 Sensei, thank you.
02:25:31 Ah, Agent 1488.
02:25:34 I see you've returned from your undercover mission.
02:25:36 You certainly know how to make an entrance.
02:25:39 I trust you have the intel.
02:25:41 What's happening?
02:25:42 My furor.
02:25:43 Apologies for teleporting directly to your inner chamber.
02:25:45 But the information I have obtained is of the utmost importance.
02:25:49 The pinkos have established contact with the other side.
02:25:52 Somehow they are able to punch through the veil between our phlogmos and physical space-time.
02:25:56 What?
02:25:57 How is this possible?
02:25:58 No signal can reach the other side?
02:26:01 The phlogm just don't create too much background noise.
02:26:04 It gupples the signal.
02:26:05 I want our top scientists working on these until their message is uncovered.
02:26:10 Yes, my furor.
02:26:11 There's just one more thing I have to report.
02:26:13 I managed to trace their signal back through physical space-time,
02:26:16 and have confirmed who is receiving the signal from Communist Hell.
02:26:20 Excellent work, Agent 1488.
02:26:23 Who is the person listening at the other side?
02:26:26 My furor.
02:26:27 It's not a person.
02:26:29 It's an entire organization.
02:26:31 There's nothing in our records about them.
02:26:33 But they've somehow amassed enough power to break through the barrier between their world and Communist Hell.
02:26:39 They call themselves the PCP.
02:26:44 Oh my God.
02:26:46 This is the dawn of a new alarm.
02:26:48 I didn't know Batman was a Nazi.
02:26:50 I didn't know Batman was a German man.
02:26:53 I guess he was all along.
02:26:55 Maybe this is like...
02:26:56 There's something about phlogmatogical space going on in there.
02:26:59 The phlogs, the phlogmos, is very intriguing to me.
02:27:03 Now I gotta look at phlogiston theory right now.
02:27:06 Figure out what it's all mean.
02:27:08 It seems like we're developing an alliance with the fine folks down in Communist Hell
02:27:13 against these clearly fascist motherfuckers,
02:27:17 Agent 1488 and this evil boss there.
02:27:20 Are they operating out of PC limbo?
02:27:23 Maybe they are.
02:27:25 They're somewhere in the in-between spaces.
02:27:27 This is level 3 autistic, level 4 autistic.
02:27:32 This whole arc.
02:27:34 I can't keep track of it.
02:27:35 Somebody do a lecture, please.
02:27:37 Okay, we've got one final voicemail,
02:27:42 and this is a continuation of another beloved saga.
02:27:45 This is not even Clusterpunk can save the PCP from me.
02:27:50 Okay, here we go.
02:27:52 Luckily I escaped from PC prison, but you guys were about to let me rot there.
02:27:55 So for retribution, I hacked some of your search histories.
02:27:57 Prepare to be exposed.
02:27:58 Okay, so Nate, we have Naked Girl.
02:28:00 Naked Girl abs.
02:28:02 Hillary Clinton leaked nudes.
02:28:04 Why was slavery abolished?

02:28:35 How did he know?
02:28:36 Don't seem to have any search histories.
02:28:38 No doubt covering up many heinous crimes.
02:28:40 No doubt.
02:28:41 He's only searched one thing the last few months.

02:29:09 Okay, well I'm having a good time with this guys.
02:29:12 No wonder the police are arrested, PCP listeners.
02:29:14 Jesus Christ.
02:29:15 Yeah.

02:29:29 The PCP voicemails are seeing marked improvements and I'm appreciating it.
02:29:33 The ratings are skyrocketing.
02:29:35 It's just insane.
02:29:36 The climbs.
02:29:37 The financial benefit we're reaping from these voicemails.
02:29:40 You wouldn't believe it if I told you.
02:29:42 The corporate sponsorships such as with Disney Plus are flooding in.
02:29:45 So let's just keep it going.

02:30:11 Oh my God, come play with us.
02:30:13 Video games, streams, build a home.
02:30:15 Wait, so we ended up making a separate Patreon and incorporating it into ours?
02:30:20 We thought it was a reasonable thing to just make an additional bonus for those people who are already pledging like $10 or more.
02:30:26 We're just giving them a free entry if they want to.
02:30:29 But we expect most people to do the separate Patreon.
