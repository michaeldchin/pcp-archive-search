00:00:00 It's me, it's Future Munchy. It was kind of right here. We have Future Hippocrit, any PCP.
00:00:06 It's me.
00:00:07 Okay, we just want to stress real quick here. We're scared baby cowards. We are good people.
00:00:15 We are the good guys in this situation. We represent wholesome intellectual values,
00:00:21 and we have nothing against people. If you look bad or are ugly, we don't hate you.
00:00:27 Yeah, the things that go on in this podcast will make you cry. It doesn't matter who you are.
00:00:32 So the thoughts and feelings and words said by me and Munchy do not reflect the thoughts,
00:00:39 feelings of me and Munchy. We were joking. It was a robot. It was someone else.
00:00:46 Yeah, it was a clone. It was an evil twin. It was a badass. He was a really cool guy,
00:00:53 and he upstayed just in every way. I believe everything that I said, but I said it in a mean
00:01:03 way, probably. I felt like it was unfair. It's just a trigger warning. Just don't kill me.
00:01:11 Just please don't kill me. I don't want to die. I like you, all of you good guys, all of you
00:01:17 men and women, and all the other ones shout out to those guys. We're on your side. I am the biggest
00:01:27 liberal cuck of anyone to ever exist. Martin Luther King Jr., shit, he's gone. Get rid of him. Bye.
00:01:34 It's me now. I'm on your side just a little bit of intellectual curiosity. Just putting words
00:01:42 out there. Just a little bit of an idea. I'm going to die. I will be dead. I will be dead.
00:01:54 Anyway, enjoy the podcast. Just remember, everyone else is evil, not us. That's why we're doing this.
00:02:01 We are the good guys. Everyone else is bad guys. If everyone's transphobic, I just throw it on
00:02:06 everyone else. We aren't bad. We promise. Don't kill me. Hello, everyone, and welcome to another
00:02:15 episode of the Procrastinators podcast. I am the best guy ever, and this is the PCP. We're a bunch
00:02:22 of internet people get together. We all make stuff here, and here is us talking about it. We're joined
00:02:27 today by Ben St.
00:02:37 Hippocrite is here. Hippocrite, everyone. Sorry, I was saluting the flag of whatever that song was.
00:02:44 What song is that? I don't know. I guess it's probably Scottish, because in my head it's not
00:02:49 played on the bagpipes. It does sound like bagpipes. Okay, Munchy, where's Tiny Hats?
00:02:53 I just got back from Papua New Guinea. I've been spending my entire, the past 10 years with a
00:03:00 native tribe, and they've taught me wisdoms you wouldn't even able to be comprehending with your
00:03:07 dumbass white boy brain. They taught me secrets such as don't look at the sun and also play in dirt.
00:03:15 It's fun. So I'm here to spread these invaluable truths with the population. Did all their lessons
00:03:22 rhyme like that? Oh, they talk exclusively in rhymes. Dr. Seuss is a black aboriginal.
00:03:32 And we're also joined by Tom Oliver. Yeah.
00:03:40 Okay, well, speaking of African places that we just came back from, which is the topic of this
00:03:45 video, I just came back from Nejair. Nejair, that's how I think it's pronounced. Funnily enough,
00:03:53 I actually wrote down for a school test. Am I in trouble now? I wrote down for a school test,
00:03:58 I wrote down nigger instead of Niger on an actual test that I put in. What are they going to do?
00:04:04 What are they going to do? No, they gave me full credit that there's actually no penalty.
00:04:08 They gave you a gold star. You actually get bonus credit, bonus. You're right. Okay. Can I tell my
00:04:13 n-word story? No, no, because we don't know what this topic is. We're lost in the fucking dark.
00:04:18 We need to be guided by African countries that we're not allowed to go to, right? We need a
00:04:22 dictionary of non-rule descent to guide us. Here's what we got. Here's what we got for you,
00:04:28 everybody. The topic for today is things you're not allowed to say. Things kind of like George
00:04:34 Carlin's old skit about the seven words you're not allowed to say on television. It's that sort
00:04:38 of thing. It's a little bit broader here. And it's kind of a broad topic. There's no
00:04:43 one urban dictionary definition that really fits this. I tried searching for a bad word.
00:04:48 That's what I found. There was a definition here. The first one's just a list of swears not supposed
00:04:53 to say, ass fuck bitch, skank slut, asshole, ass wipe, cunt, hoe, whore, bitch, ass, damn. But then
00:04:58 there's a little definition. That was weak. It was very weak. And here's the longer definition.
00:05:04 Words that are said in order to make someone or something look or feel bad, cursing is a type
00:05:08 of bad word usage. Okay. That's like, okay, but we're going broader than just bad words here.
00:05:15 There's no definition here. There's no bad ideas of which Nate is full of.
00:05:18 Of course. But Ben wanted to tell his n-word story. What do you got for us, Ben?
00:05:23 Well, it's, I might have told it before, but I'll tell it again here. When I was like,
00:05:27 I was probably in like fourth grade or something. And remember how our parents used to,
00:05:31 used to cruelly and inhumanely leave us at like an after school program while they were at work?
00:05:35 Oh, of course. That's unfortunate. Yeah, yeah.
00:05:39 Stephen Mullenew would be very upset if he heard this. He would be very upset.
00:05:43 And I remember I had, I had a black friend when I was like in elementary school.
00:05:48 This just gets worse and worse. Yeah, yeah, the problems all started here.
00:05:52 And we had like a little electronic, like digital dictionary. It was like a little like toy thing
00:05:58 where you could look up words in this like little database. And he was like, oh, look up,
00:06:04 look up this word. And he types in n-i-g-e-r. And I'm like, what, and it's like,
00:06:10 doesn't find the word. And I'm like, oh, what's that? And he's like, oh, I guess it doesn't
00:06:16 know the word, but it's a bad word for black people. And I was like, oh, okay. And that's how
00:06:21 I learned about that word. Did you try putting in n-i-g-g-e-r or anything?
00:06:28 I don't, I think he, yeah, I think he then was like, oh, wait, wait, wait. And then he tried it
00:06:32 with two Gs. And it also did not, it also did not return anything because of course it fucking
00:06:36 wouldn't because this was like a fucking toy kids dictionary on a fucking little micro computer.
00:06:41 Dude, I didn't see the guy who programmed that in. Like, I wonder, they got to learn somehow.
00:06:46 Just type that. You know, it's a funny thing though, us like adults policing what kids
00:06:51 shouldn't, shouldn't know as like just, just words that exist. Even it's like, I guess specifically
00:06:57 with like racial slurs, it's like we don't, the concept of the racial slur comes with a lot of
00:07:02 baggage that we just don't want children to have. Like we don't want kids to like differentiate
00:07:07 between racial groups because not a lot of good comes from doing so. So I guess I understand
00:07:14 like not wanting kids to hear that. Like when it comes to words like fuck and shit,
00:07:17 I don't really see the need to keep kids from hearing words like that. Yeah, I don't know. I
00:07:23 never have. I think the kids who do find out about it are then like they use it as currency to become
00:07:31 popular. That's true. And I guess if it wasn't those words, it would be something else.
00:07:35 As have I right now. Kids like hiding things from other kids to be like stupid and stuff.
00:07:40 Here's my Jordan Peterson archetypal moment. Okay, that functions just like the story of
00:07:45 Adam and Eve, the forbidden fruit of knowledge, was actually just some sick ass swear words that
00:07:50 Eve found out from Satan himself. And Adam was like, yo, share that with me, bro. And then when
00:07:55 big daddy God found out, he was super pissed and he grounded them for life, which inspired the show
00:08:01 grounded for life. It was a big daddy God is actually the name of my first.
00:08:09 We found out that that that that Eve had taken by the apple. He wouldn't give them
00:08:13 Cummys anymore for like an entire big ordeal, which is why Adam had to make his own Cummys,
00:08:20 which inspired original sin. Oh my God, we figured it out.
00:08:25 Well, guys. Okay, so what do we this is like the concept of like forbidden knowledge almost
00:08:32 like bad words, like words themselves are simply tools like anything, right? Yes. So where
00:08:38 why do we get this whole idea? Yeah, what do you got? Well, I was gonna say, I have I have a thing
00:08:44 that you're not allowed to say, say like, especially on the internet, especially on a like a red
00:08:49 pill podcast like this. The idea that social justice isn't all that bad. And in fact, some of
00:08:57 them have a point. I have a point where I literally support not freedom of speech in this
00:09:08 scenario. Like like self policing. So well, self policing is very different from the kind of social
00:09:14 justice mob justice, you know, like, like social justice warriors are like stupid people who I
00:09:21 think are very funny. But social justice as like a thing is like, it's not a bad idea. Like,
00:09:29 yeah, I mean, I mean, I mean, on the on the face of it, it sounds pretty good, right?
00:09:33 Okay, I guess you're getting there with like, is that really like the racial slur thing? Or
00:09:37 like how we expect? It's just that the idea that I was bringing forth a thing that you're not allowed
00:09:43 to say on the internet. Okay, okay, that's your point. But like, you know, it's because like,
00:09:51 like the idea of like, policing it is stupid, like making sure like quotas and stuff. No,
00:09:56 you don't need that. But the idea that we got a character, should we have a woman character or
00:10:01 a black character or like a gay character? Like, yeah, yeah, sure. No, not if you want me to read
00:10:09 the correct answer is who cares? Yeah, like, why not? Why not be okay with it? I mean,
00:10:16 the yeah, yeah, it's just it's not really just so much as like the idea of normalizing it is like
00:10:22 completely harmless. Okay, here's here's my here's my quote unquote counter argument, which
00:10:28 isn't really a counter argument. But kind of is the reason I have no when when when these things
00:10:34 happen, there's like the social justice injections of like minorities and other shit into media.
00:10:40 My problem is never the fact that there's more more minority representation. It's always,
00:10:45 I know the reasoning behind it now because they pulled the curtain out way right and that's what
00:10:50 pisses me off because like, I know this wasn't a natural artistic development in the production
00:10:55 of this thing. Someone checked off some boxes. There's nothing wrong with making a character
00:11:01 a non white cis male. But in fact, in fact, I think it's it's nice. I do I like I like
00:11:08 the idea of representation in principle. But when it comes when it comes off as contrived,
00:11:13 then you've you've done I feel like you've done more damage. Yeah, or even if it's not contrived
00:11:18 when it comes off as like it when you feel that like what you're seeing there is not so much
00:11:22 an artistic, you know, expression as so much of like, like, micromanaging of a creator's desire,
00:11:29 like that's that just speaks to like, okay, well, we just want to create a specific example
00:11:33 that I'm going to talk about because I like I went to Germany recently and I was pitching a show.
00:11:40 This was a show I hadn't made. But yeah, a lot of the show characters, you know, are gay or like,
00:11:47 you know, race, many races in this, you know, but like, it's a fantasy. Is that hard to animate,
00:11:53 Gibb? The fact that there's so many races, like that everyone's running all the time.
00:11:56 You know what I'm saying, dude. Okay, yeah. But like, I had no problem because like the way
00:12:04 that the story was written, because I was brought on to write with the story, I didn't write it,
00:12:08 obviously, about the the race and the gender, you know, stuff like it's not a show about
00:12:15 a woman being the main character. It's a show about, you know, cool shit. And a woman just
00:12:21 happens to be the main character. And I made my pitch and stuff. And then I the the person who
00:12:26 came directly after me was the complete wrong, like the opposite of like, you know, they had the
00:12:32 same sort of thing, just all that shit was like the focus. But yeah, they literally like their
00:12:37 whole pitch was like, every single social justice were a buzzword. And nothing about what the story
00:12:43 was or why we should give a shit about this show. Well, that's just that's exactly because it was
00:12:48 basically the same thing on the surface level. But nobody gave a shit, especially me. I was like,
00:12:53 why would you tell me about this show? This is this was the person that was pitching their show
00:12:59 after you. Yeah. Okay. And it was just about, I really wanted to show that, you know, women can
00:13:05 be main characters and represented blacks. I'm just I didn't even mention that in mine because
00:13:12 it was important. And it just annoyed me because that's my point basically entirely is when you
00:13:18 do this for the wrong reasons, like you're you're the integrity of the product isn't there because
00:13:23 there is none. Yeah, like what I would really want to see is like that person to like finish their
00:13:27 show, like at like display it to the public. And then like, if that show like tanks, because nobody
00:13:33 gives a shit about it, because all it does is like, that's kind of what you see with like this,
00:13:37 like right now, Marvel is pushing a lot of diversity in their comics and shit. And yeah,
00:13:42 exactly. And like the comic industry is doing very badly. People are turned off by it in a big
00:13:49 way. And they're being forced to reevaluate their position here. So it's like, the marketplace
00:13:54 does not support just ideological brow beating, you know, through through their comics, you know,
00:13:59 with something like the comics, changing the gender or the race of characters people know
00:14:03 and love is not the way to do it. You make new characters that are just good and that have
00:14:09 We can't have that. We can't make original IPs anymore. The market saturated with them. And we
00:14:15 got to play it safe. Oh, well, we've had too many ideas in the past. We've farmed we've farmed the
00:14:21 future. We've we've stripped mind the future of ideas. And now we've pulled them all out. And
00:14:26 there's no more new ones to be had. We've just got to work with what we've got.
00:14:30 Unfortunate. This was a problem, I guess I had back in the good old days of the Wild West of
00:14:38 Gamergate, where it was hard for me to like, it's hard for me to tell all the time when a like
00:14:48 when a black person is a black person for corporate or for artistic reasons, you know,
00:14:53 that's the issue right there. There's obvious, you know, there's obvious examples of, you know,
00:14:58 a black person never corporate, you know, gain of which I can name exactly zero, but I'm sure
00:15:03 they exist because everyone says that they do. But I it I a lot of time I would imagine if it's
00:15:10 a small like, you know, indie game as it was with a lot of Gamergate people, you know, talking
00:15:17 points, but there's probably just done because they like black people. And I think it's hard to,
00:15:22 you know, I would say that like as a general statement, I would say like, like, I like,
00:15:27 yeah, like Ben said, I like black people, I like seeing them in video games every so often,
00:15:33 pretty good. So I think as a Blake and statement, I want to encourage that. And I, and I don't,
00:15:38 I'm skeptical of the like, how often is there really a border mean of all right, we need like a
00:15:44 couple more black people here, like, I just need it. It's probably more often than any of us would
00:15:49 like to admit like the BBC is on record saying they have like quotas that they have to meet now
00:15:54 and they post jobs all the time where they're like, white people can't apply like straight up.
00:15:59 Like this is my majority job. I want to I want to take I want to take sorry, you can you can go.
00:16:04 No, no, no, it's fine. Okay, well, well, I think this is a good time for me to stake my claim
00:16:09 because I want to put this out there. So everyone knows where I stand on this issue. Oh, no. There
00:16:15 is a well, it's not a big deal. It's stupid. You're all going to be disappointed. There is a
00:16:19 there is a Mr. B tongue video that was controversial and it's about like the one about diversity
00:16:25 and the one about I got I forget what it's called but it's the one where he talks about
00:16:30 CD project and how like their games are different because they come from like a Polish culture,
00:16:36 which is not like a well represented culture and stuff and how like more diversity leads to like
00:16:42 fresher ideas and stuff. And I fucking love that video. And anyone that disagrees with it is stupid.
00:16:49 And well, wait, was he was he making a point that like the buzzwords for the discussion of that was
00:16:54 that there are too many white people in this Polish game. But was he I forget what he was
00:16:59 saying about that was he agreeing that like there should be black people in the winter? No,
00:17:02 no, well, he said that he said that maybe there should be. But was he saying that because the
00:17:08 game was all about Polish like folklore and stuff. And yeah, because CD project is Polish and Polish
00:17:16 people don't make that many games, like that's why CD projects games feel a little different.
00:17:22 And that's what he likes about it. And I think that's great. And I was already kind of I was
00:17:28 already kind of blue pilled. But then I watched that Mr. B tongue video. And then I was fully then
00:17:33 I took my big I took a big vat of blue pills and blue gel capsules and crack them all open to a
00:17:39 swimming pool and just die right now. That's not even really a blue pill point. It's not.
00:17:44 Well, and why did I get in so many bitter arguments about people are the stupidest people
00:17:51 ever. So I'm not I'm not I'm not talking about people on YouTube. I'm talking about people in
00:17:56 this very PCP that we're in people in the PCP fought me to the nail on that issue. Well, then
00:18:03 I could not everybody in this podcast who isn't me is retarded and because that point is totally
00:18:08 fine because it's not I love it. It's not contradictory to anything we were just talking
00:18:12 about because that has nothing to do that. That's the reason that that game feels refreshing isn't
00:18:18 necessarily because it was Polish people's because it was Polish folklore. It was a concept that it
00:18:23 was a it was a well of inspiration that hasn't been tapped on a lot. And while those the Polish
00:18:30 people are in a better position to take those ideas because they're familiar with them, anybody
00:18:34 could have just really said, hey, look at Poland, let's take some ideas from there. And they could
00:18:38 have no I don't think would have been would have been his nuance and authentic, probably not,
00:18:42 but it still would have been different. So it's an intellectual thing that's being brought to the
00:18:47 table. It's ideas that make it refreshing. And yeah, but I think that I think that the thing
00:18:52 here, the idea is that like, people from different backgrounds bring new perspectives and ideas to
00:18:59 things. So like, okay, yeah, I think it's would be over. I think it's oversimplifying to say that,
00:19:04 okay, if we're talking about games, like, yeah, the games industry, it's a lot of white males and
00:19:08 stuff. But like, that's not, I don't know. There's lots of different types of white male. Yeah,
00:19:14 the term is so wide. I think I think it's not important to point out the specifics of like,
00:19:19 oh, it's white cis males that are doing it. That's not the point is that it's a monoculture and
00:19:23 it attracts people of like a like minded culture and societal values and outlooks and similar
00:19:29 and similar ideas and sensibilities. And is it like an exclusive thing that kind of pushes people
00:19:35 away that I do not share that same minds, including, you know, minorities and women and things like
00:19:41 that. So I, yeah, basically, I just really like the idea of inclusive inclusiveness and that
00:19:50 fucking because he says that Mr. Butung says in that video that like, we're not doing them a favor
00:19:54 by letting them make video games. It's more like we're, we're allowing them to do us a favor by
00:19:59 like, bringing their fresh perspective. No one's allowing anybody to do a goddamn favor. They made
00:20:03 their own studio and made their own fucking video games. They built it up themselves. They didn't
00:20:07 need anybody. The end result is that you get something that you wouldn't have otherwise.
00:20:11 And it's not positive for you. And I'm not here. I'm not saying, I'm not talking about like a
00:20:15 conspiracy to keep women out of video games or anything. It's the, like the problem,
00:20:20 how the fuck did I get on fucking women in video games? And this is a fucking game or game.
00:20:23 I'll finish the point and then we can move on. The problem is that the culture is hostile to
00:20:34 outsiders. And that's what key, that's what it's not a hard kind of what cultures are.
00:20:38 Cultures inherently have barriers around them. Well, people who are not within the culture.
00:20:42 Yeah. Well, there's, there's, there's degrees. I don't want to get into this. I'm just gonna
00:20:46 let that point go. Let me just say one point about this. And is that ironically, Ben,
00:20:49 Poland is by far the most red-pilled MGTOW country in Europe by far. That's neither here nor there.
00:20:57 It's still illustrative of the point. But then again, so we're like, so it's like, I mean,
00:21:03 they can't hold a candle to like Islamic country is like fucking, you know, Iran and shit. They're
00:21:07 pretty. But what about Sharia law, Ben? What about Sharia law? What about Sharia law?
00:21:14 Dude, that's a game about Sharia law. But it's just, it's red-pilled as fuck. And yet it's like
00:21:19 loved by like feminists and SJWs. Okay, but whatever. Let's get off this shit. I want to ask for
00:21:25 clarification on that, but I'm scared to. I was very confused that entire time because I didn't
00:21:31 know what side anyone was on. But here's the thing. Imagine like there's like a game where,
00:21:37 or a story where the law is humanity was underground for fucking millions of years.
00:21:44 And they do this. And you're talking about homeless. Yeah. And imagine, imagine that's a show. And
00:21:49 then, you know, everybody's like real white and pasty because they've never had any son. And then
00:21:54 there's a black guy in there for like, for like diversity. I hate stuff like that. It doesn't
00:21:59 make any sense with the law of the world. So get out of here, blackie.
00:22:07 Alternate timeline where Nate watched her in the gamba. You couldn't get past the first episode
00:22:11 because they were all black in this timeline. Oh, that's my, that's, that's real life.
00:22:18 Let me, let me touch on this thing that I sometimes feel weird about. It's that like, okay.
00:22:25 Okay. Okay. Pretty much all my, all in my comics and stuff. Everyone's white, more or less. And
00:22:34 it's not that like, it's not like a deliberate like, everyone's got to be white. It's just.
00:22:39 That's gonna take about a hour in my brain. But we grew up, we grew up around almost exclusively
00:22:44 white people. There was so little diversity. The truth is that we are not racist for just
00:22:49 like that sort of being our vision of like a default human being. There's nothing wrong.
00:22:53 Yeah. Like it's just, it's just the way that it should be. I don't have a lot of like,
00:22:58 I never had a lot of like black friends or anything. And yeah, the way that I see it,
00:23:04 if I made a character and made them black, I would have two options. I could either treat them and
00:23:12 characterize them exactly as I would anyone else, which would be the same way as a white person.
00:23:16 And that would be fine and everything. Or I could like, unless the story is like about
00:23:22 their race, but then it'd be like, well, how would I even fucking write about that? I have no,
00:23:28 I have no footing in that culture. No, I have nothing meaningful to say. This is a whole
00:23:33 interesting point with social justice and how they push this forced diversity shit is that
00:23:38 they, it's a damned if you do, damned if you don't, because if you, if you're just doing white
00:23:42 people and stuff, and that's your characters, they'll be like, well, you need to have diversity.
00:23:47 And then it's like, okay, I guess I'll add a black person. Then it's like, well, this is an
00:23:50 inauthentic representation of X, whatever representation we want in this show. So basically
00:23:56 what it's really about is it's they, what they're, they're saying we need more representation,
00:24:00 but at the end of the day, what they really want, they want you to get the fuck out of their whitey.
00:24:03 That's, that's the end goal. Look, here's what I'm thinking about this. It's like, okay, I,
00:24:06 let's say I make a comic. I, it's all white. They're like, okay, put a black guy in. Okay,
00:24:10 put a black guy in there. Like, okay, you did this all wrong. Like, why is he talking white?
00:24:15 And I'm like, oh, let me fix that. So I make him sound black or something. They're like, well,
00:24:19 why are you being so fucking racist right now? Exactly. Why isn't he acting just like the white
00:24:22 people you fucking racist? Like, is, is race relevant or not? I don't know. Yeah. Take a,
00:24:28 take a side. The problem is, I say no, by the way, I say completely no. It's a complete social
00:24:34 construct. I think there's almost no value in it. And I'd rather just go away. For sure. If, yeah,
00:24:38 like, like, no matter what your race is, you're going to grow up acting like the people around
00:24:42 you. And to go back to a little bit of genetic stuff, to go back to a second to what Ben was
00:24:47 saying about Poland and stuff. The interesting thing is that like, well, the, the, the Poland
00:24:51 example works, like, when people push for diversity and stuff in like America, I kind of don't feel
00:24:57 as, as, as like it has the same thing, because we're, despite the fact that there's a bunch of
00:25:02 different races and sexual orientation stuff here, despite the very like surface level, like
00:25:08 different experiences, we're all growing up in the same culture. So our experiences aren't as
00:25:14 different as someone growing up in an entirely different country with an entire different set
00:25:18 of cultural experiences. So what, when you have something in an American setting, like that's
00:25:23 the whole thing. The reason America worked and now like is kind of falling apart as this whole
00:25:28 like race thing goes crazy is because America was built on a set of values and everybody
00:25:33 regardless who they were, shared those values. And that's why the whole thing works. So when
00:25:38 you start doing all this race shit, it falls apart. This little, this little race kerfuffle
00:25:42 we're involved in. This little race war we're about to start is right. Here's, here's, here's
00:25:47 one example of my intense red pilling. So here I go. I am actually angry about how much I have
00:25:54 to think about trans people, despite them being such a tiny percent of real people in real life.
00:25:59 You know what, I'm mad about that. I kind of am too. I agree. I agree. Why the fuck do I have to
00:26:04 think about trans people so much when I like never ever met one? 99% virtue signaling. Yeah, it
00:26:10 makes me mad. It makes me mad that a thing can be popular for no other reason than because it
00:26:16 references or is somehow relevant to trans people because trans issues are what are trendy on the
00:26:22 internet right now. Just in the fucking marketplace, they should have so little stake. And I get that
00:26:27 we don't want them to be fucking, you know, trampled or discriminated against. I'm with you on that.
00:26:31 Why the fuck do I have to think about your problems all the time? But I got my own problems.
00:26:36 I see a disproportionate with his wicked ideas. Yeah, phantom horn,
00:26:40 angry horse man. There he is. Insanely, Ben insanely transphobic saint. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:26:47 Insanely. I've never met a more red pill man in my entire life than Vincent.
00:26:54 And you never will. Because if there is one, I'll kill them. Yeah, yeah, I just want to agree that
00:27:01 yeah, I feel like I hear a lot like a disproportionate amount of media is relevant to trans issues.
00:27:09 You know what I'm saying? I'd like to hear more about furry rights. At least they look funny.
00:27:14 I agree. At least they're cool. At least they work really hard. Because my mom grounds me when I say
00:27:23 fuck. It's really, it's really getting to me. My mom says I can't say nigger when I'm at the dinner
00:27:29 table. I want to talk about one time I saw, I don't remember why, but I was, oh, I think it was
00:27:36 when I was practicing for one of the races. You had to really try to get in that way. I was
00:27:41 practicing the black race. It was really going hard. I saw, I think I was looking at some speed
00:27:46 running records and I saw that a couple of records in I forget what game were held by a woman. And I
00:27:51 was like, oh, whoa, well, this is interesting. Like, it's just like a high tier pro speed running
00:27:58 female. Like, well, let's go check her out. Go to her YouTube channel. It's a trans. It's a trans
00:28:04 woman. It's a trans woman. Proving that even men are better women than women. That's what we've
00:28:09 learned here today. It's one of those ones who wears like a pink, fluffy, low-lead dress and like
00:28:15 big, like, big, like blue banana curls. Just does way over the top and does the like ultra,
00:28:20 ultra, like anime girly style of that version of being a woman. I would beseech any legitimate
00:28:26 trans person, I think would have no choice but to completely agree with my points. Like,
00:28:30 for what reason are your issues forced on the like such a huge amount of media relates to your
00:28:37 tiny little niche thing? I don't like why the glasses fetishists of the world, such as myself,
00:28:42 do not consume the massive amount of airwaves that like these other things do. And why is that?
00:28:48 It's because nobody gives a fuck about our problems. They are our own to deal with and no one should
00:28:53 ever care about them. And same should here. Same should here. I'll go ahead and say something
00:28:59 that you can't say. Please do. There's, all right, here's what I think. Here's what I think. If you
00:29:06 are of a mindset where you do not feel okay unless you are dressed, say, as a woman, if you're a
00:29:14 biological male, if your mindset is such that like if you're not dressed as a woman, you're like,
00:29:19 you're not okay. Dressing as a woman is not the solution to that because like the problem is way
00:29:24 deeper, you know. Uh-oh. Insanely transphobic. But it strikes again. And I want to say I'm not
00:29:32 saying that someone who wants to wear a dress shouldn't wear a dress. Not what I'm saying,
00:29:35 but I am saying that the solution is that it's not it's not it's not a solution to be like,
00:29:42 oh, well, I'm just going to wear a dress and everyone has to call me a woman or else I fucking
00:29:48 will be I'll just break down and cry. I'll just break down and cry if someone refers to me as a
00:29:53 man, you know. Since this is just what the podcast is now, I have something to say about the transgender
00:29:58 community. I think a lot of the time the way transgendered people like present the issues
00:30:09 are like are transphobic and like sexist. Yeah. Oh, oh my god. They're so they're so sexist. They're
00:30:17 so sexist. Oh, okay, okay, okay. The way my ideal society would work is Mulan because at the end
00:30:25 of Mulan Mulan has like gone through all these trials and tribulations trying to be a man trying
00:30:29 to act like what she thinks a man is to, you know, do all the shit written into a Disney movie,
00:30:34 but just bear with me. But at the end Mulan does cool things and she is a good person in a dress
00:30:42 and the thing about being a man or being a woman is that it doesn't actually matter. Like you can
00:30:48 be a masculine girl and wear a dress. You it just is a set of actions and ideals that you have like
00:30:56 like it's just super undefined and trying to like act like oh I'm going to be a man that doesn't mean
00:31:04 anything. That isn't actually anything. When they say that gender is performative
00:31:11 and then they're like okay well I'm going to put on a suit and like cut my hair short and like,
00:31:17 you know, take hormone pills so I'm growing a beard. Well this means I'm a man because I'm
00:31:22 performing as one. Well shit, aren't you fucking pigeonholing what men are like? Like not all men
00:31:27 have beards, not all men wear suits, not all men work out or drink beer or whatever. Well you don't
00:31:32 appropriate that culture. The only time it's okay to be like a classically beautiful woman
00:31:37 right now according to you know the current feminist ideology is when you are a trans woman
00:31:42 because then it's okay to adhere to the stereotype and you're not just you know feeding the patriarchy
00:31:46 by giving them what they want. Okay I know this is like an unfair blanket statement and I'm sure
00:31:50 that there are exceptions probably a lot of them but so but so many trans women their idea of what
00:31:58 being a woman is is this is this overblown fucking like china doll like hyper like hyper feminized
00:32:05 yeah and it's like that that's you that's the great thing to say it is no no it is you know what
00:32:11 is it's female blackface it's female fucking blackface is what it is and this isn't to say this
00:32:15 isn't to say that like if you're a man you can't wear a dress or if you're a woman you can't wear
00:32:19 a suit that's what I want no I want you to just wear what you want because it's what you like
00:32:25 if there's some guy who's like okay I just want to look like a woman because that's just what I'm
00:32:31 into I guess then of course but it's like what is there's no problem there I just don't like
00:32:37 when you're saying that all men or all women are a certain way that you try and perform as
00:32:42 like it's a fucking kabuki theater act. There's a real element there's a real element of like
00:32:49 imposing their worldview onto the language of others and demanding that the way that others
00:32:55 speak in a way that conforms to what they believe and it makes me mad okay well here's the thing
00:33:00 it's really makes me mad if we're we're gonna go down this rabbit hole like this is because we just
00:33:05 fucking are apparently this is the thing and I've always had a question about and I haven't been
00:33:11 able to get a good answer I've talked to a couple trans people about it and I never really get a
00:33:16 straight answer at least something I find satisfactory to to satisfy my kind of like cognitive
00:33:21 dissonance with this is that yeah we have this whole like kind of like blue-pilled you know leftist
00:33:27 ideology that talks about all these issues and that's where all these talking points really come
00:33:30 from. By the way Tom I just want to put it in here I am those blue-pilled person in the entire world.
00:33:35 I agree for sure of course. Okay okay. I I may I'm catching up to you much you one day I'll be as
00:33:41 blue-pilled as you are. I aspire to it. Well my point is that we we talk about like or they talk
00:33:50 about I guess I talk about I'm talking about now too about how gender is a social construct right
00:33:55 and there's no difference between men and women men and women are just as capable they're the same
00:33:59 thing it's all about a performance and then you're talking about trans people and how you can be a
00:34:06 man's brain trapped in a woman's body in vice versa and it's like these two statements you can't
00:34:11 have them at the same time right because if you if if gender is just a performance and your trans
00:34:18 you don't need any surgery you don't need anything to kind of correct anything you just start acting
00:34:23 as something else and so I know like a lot of this like social justice stuff I feel is
00:34:29 faces so much I guess pushback from people because they make everything needlessly more
00:34:34 complicated like that point like we've added like 10 billion genders like what we should have done
00:34:40 just like none of this matters there's just there's we shouldn't have any difference in gender there
00:34:45 should be no gender performance you like added you just subtracted instead of adding things
00:34:50 would have made it that point you blah sorry keep going that I'll go for it that that point you just
00:34:55 made about how gen the the performative gender thing it makes me so mad because it literally
00:35:00 means that tomboy's aren't women like they don't like if you if you act masculine then you're not a
00:35:05 woman because you're not performing the gender and holy fucking shit how fucking sexist and like
00:35:10 fucking and fucking like conformed to my world you because what you can you possibly feel like I
00:35:15 feel like acting like a man so I need I must be trans and it's like well okay but if you just feel
00:35:22 like acting like something just act like it like you don't have to make a huge fucking big deal out
00:35:27 I've had this like thought for like a while uh uh because like you know I like boobs
00:35:34 what if I what if I just what if I just had them what if I just got some grafted onto me and then
00:35:40 just stayed the same and say people would say uh so you were trans and I said no I just have boobs
00:35:46 now I just have boobs I just like them why are we getting there there was a chapter of a manga that
00:35:52 I forget the name of it's like miss so and so's uh nurse clinic and it's about monster girls the
00:35:57 main character is a is a Cyclops with massive tits and she is a nurse in a school full of monster
00:36:02 kids and that's cool yeah and one of the chapters is about like a dude who is obsessed with tits
00:36:08 and like in this world whenever a kid like goes through puberty they like develop their like
00:36:13 monster characteristic and they're all they're always different this particular guy who's like
00:36:16 obsessed with tits he himself turns like just into a woman like he just gets tits uh actually
00:36:22 I guess that's probably the only thing that happens I think other than that he's still
00:36:24 got a dick and stuff but he's just like you know what I like how your voice cracked when you said
00:36:28 dick I like how your voice I uh so the the the the ultimate point of the guy is just that like he
00:36:36 he just like because he just owns it like all the guys that he was like encouraging to like be
00:36:41 ledges and look at tits now he's just like well now I just have this so I will just like enjoy it
00:36:45 and be able to look upon myself as like a sexy tit having individual and so he starts dressing up
00:36:50 like a girl and just being that but he's like no like I am the manliest man in the world I just
00:36:54 have this awesome set of tits that I rock and it's fucking fantastic and uh I'm just gonna live
00:36:59 like this forever and it's great so he just even being able is able to appreciate like his own body
00:37:04 as a sexual object uh and it's great and I don't know I'd like that like the way that he just like
00:37:11 accepts what he is like he doesn't feel the need to like chop off his dick I gotta tell you this is
00:37:15 where I have some issues with this I just don't see the solution to any kind of psychological
00:37:22 discomfort to being cutting off body parts what that's just my other psychological come out with
00:37:28 some crazy pictographs nowadays yeah what other psychological condition is the solution that
00:37:34 you make the outside look like the inside like that's not done for anything else like yeah like
00:37:39 it like the solution if you like are depressed and and think you're ugly they don't tell you oh
00:37:43 well you will you better get some plastic surgery then so you can look the way you feel on the inside
00:37:47 well hey let me it's like fucking I get yourself a steam stored it stored let me push back on that
00:37:52 a little bit though but let's bet if there was a magical like wand you could wave to just make
00:37:57 these transformations instantly like would that be a different case um you know like if there was
00:38:03 no no no because I'm not saying that you shouldn't get surgery I'm just saying that like getting
00:38:10 surgery is one is one thing but like the problems that are making you sad are another yeah you know
00:38:17 well gender dysphoria is like an actual mental condition I'm not trying to underline it's been
00:38:22 redefined now it's been redefined it's no longer one it's being redefined and I think that's kind
00:38:27 of dangerous because like if if these people actually have a condition I think it should be treated
00:38:32 as a condition and not as a fad and I feel like it's devolving into well you know I'm sure these
00:38:37 people would say that it really should have never been like a disorder of any kind it should have
00:38:41 always been treated like again to talk more about this weird kind of like SJW hypocrisy isn't it
00:38:46 interesting that people wear depression and like you know the headbates and all these weird conditions
00:38:51 as a disorder as a badge of honor but then when it comes to being trans like it's not a disorder
00:38:55 that's offensive what is the line being drawn there even though I'm with everything said here
00:39:02 I just want to say that I haven't like actually seen any like headmates or like I haven't actually
00:39:09 seen any like absolutely crazy out there um trans people most of the ones I've seen have been like
00:39:17 pretty normal people so you know this is not a comment on trans people this is a comment on the
00:39:26 ideology that's pushing this agenda I think I think that goes without saying but just to say it again
00:39:30 just in general like this is I try not to argue with people I try to argue against ideas because
00:39:36 I feel like this is a philosophy discussion show this is not a listen to me you loser I have known
00:39:41 at least one crazy trans person who was fucking bizarre and she wore she wore goat horns everywhere
00:39:49 she went like giant goat and like a crown and like a crown of flowers is that weird
00:39:56 and um is this like a trans species thing or are you trying to be like yeah yeah she was like a
00:40:00 goat yeah she was a trans goat she talked all the time about getting like real horns transplanted
00:40:05 onto her head did she change changed her name to clover because that's a goat name oh the ultimate
00:40:10 furry the ultimate furry uh like but you know she was actually she she she was actually kind of a
00:40:17 nice guy most of the time so whatever hey hey I just want to state to go back like like like
00:40:23 the general ideas of things I don't know if it's gonna out me as like a beta cuck loser
00:40:28 but I don't know what these people mean when they say like I feel like a man like yeah I don't
00:40:35 know what that feels like that can't possibly mean anything yeah and even if it did how would
00:40:41 you fucking know I think I think what they mean is I feel like the social the societal um like
00:40:48 normative like generic like this is what everyone decides a man is I feel like that guys I feel
00:40:54 like a generic sitcom dad from the 1950s aka a man that like that's what I think a man is I feel
00:41:02 like that like one one time I was talking one time I was talking to a guy um well a trans woman
00:41:10 or trans girl whatever and they were and they were like well I just I feel like a woman in my head
00:41:16 and I was like well how do you know what a woman feels like and and like they they fucking cussed
00:41:20 me the fuck right out I respect your challenge there but on the other I do want to be like how
00:41:27 could we really understand what they feel like like I don't I don't care about how do they understand
00:41:34 like like there's more going on here there's more going on here because yeah they feel how they feel
00:41:39 but then they're translating it and they're saying well I feel like that I feel like that other group
00:41:43 of people and it's like okay do you know okay how do you know how what your feelings compared to
00:41:47 theirs fuck you god damn it get out of there I mean I have never um like seen like a crazy
00:41:54 trans person but on the topic I have like something it's still like a thing you can't really say
00:41:59 because it's kind of like uh insulting um but I feel like a lot of trans people people who call
00:42:05 themselves trans they're not trying hard enough with the gimmick they're not going far enough
00:42:10 things like they say oh I'm this different gender but they don't do anything about it
00:42:18 besides maybe changing the way they dress and sure they take with that like the whole pronoun
00:42:23 thing like all this special like you I don't know whether these people actually have the dysphoria
00:42:27 that others actually really do and they're just sort of along for the ride because trans is a thing
00:42:32 now and you can be a part of a group with it well like there's no well like there's no test right
00:42:37 like there's no there's no test that you can run to tell whether someone is really trans like all
00:42:42 that makes someone trans is just that they say they are which is fine and it like if we're all
00:42:47 agreed when when there's like actual like people who are like really suffering mentally and they
00:42:51 need help and then there's other people who are just sort of like uh yeah I feel like I feel like
00:42:56 wearing jeans I feel like wearing jeans and boots sometimes so I guess I'll be I guess I'll join
00:43:01 it right and and I'll guess I'll join this culture that like gives me a feeling like I'm a part of
00:43:05 something right because it's not just because it's not just about yourself it's about being a part
00:43:09 of a social it's totally about getting social currency yeah that's what all of this is about you
00:43:14 know that that's why it's all done it's like I want to be a part of this group I want to feel
00:43:19 validated I want to feel part of something bigger than myself they they and the trans community is
00:43:24 so welcoming that they will even accept Christian Weston Chandler as one of their own and and like
00:43:30 actually love him and respect him and be his fans even though he is the worst person in the world
00:43:35 and should be shot dead where he stands right now that's that's the final fucking straw for me
00:43:41 I that's how you know that this shit has gone too far on this on on any subject of this nature I
00:43:47 feel completely consistent in that I just I don't care about anyone who isn't useful to me that's
00:43:53 how I completely feel and man are these people not useful to me so I don't care about any of your
00:43:59 problems listeners any people in any of these subjugated communities your problems are your
00:44:04 own they have nothing to do with me and I hope they work out great for you but you know I just
00:44:10 don't care I just do you know where this does become your problem Nate you know how this does
00:44:13 become this is uh the the culture that surrounds these movements of ostracizing and destroying
00:44:19 anyone who disagrees with them that's where the book did you hear about what happened this guy
00:44:24 he was a teacher he's been a teacher for years um and he went up to these two girls who are working
00:44:28 on like they were working diligently in his class he was like oh nice job girls like you're doing
00:44:33 good and one of them's like how dare you misgender me and he got fired oh my god he got fired because
00:44:39 some little girl said decided she was a guy and the parents reported it to the head of the school
00:44:44 and he got fired I mean he should have known she was a guy because she was working hard
00:44:49 oh my god yeah she was she was really performing
00:44:59 you can't say that you can't say those words oh my god that was excellent
00:45:05 oh zing oh there we go that's what you were gonna do you stole my point and ran with it
00:45:11 I mean oh my god I never intended this discussion about trans stuff to like even begin I wanted to
00:45:18 talk about like the concept of how you're not allowed to say certain things which actually is
00:45:22 relevant to what we said but instead we've just spent the entire podcast saying things you're not
00:45:26 allowed to say which I don't like any of my notes whatsoever well we can we can just switch
00:45:33 a web back to what Tom's point we're gonna go into yeah uh where's point sorry go ahead man go
00:45:40 words I can't say uh what's what's to sheer sauce
00:45:48 what's the sheer sauce yeah this is a lunchy life hack right now it's it's what's the
00:45:55 shit like I've heard what's the shit I've heard I've heard what's I've heard what's the sheer and
00:46:00 I've heard what's the sheer like without war chester sauce is that a war chester here
00:46:05 well that war sauce sauce which is just Jew blood mixed with a gold
00:46:10 war chester shire I mean it it is in England and I assume I feel like it's Worcester like like
00:46:17 that's how you're supposed to there there actually is a Worcester Massachusetts as well is that where
00:46:21 is that where you live uh tower caramel yeah bent and ornate have you guys ever had people from
00:46:26 out of new england come into new england and try and pronounce the words and laugh at them because
00:46:30 like they're saying how they should be said and they're all weird because they're normal to me
00:46:34 yeah it's it's it's hilarious it's like war chester English spot just a thanks cube uh you're
00:46:41 well yeah fucking here's a munchie life hack and like like rest here's like a new munchie recipe
00:46:47 for you if you're out of a one sauce I'm gonna teach how to make munchie shaw's which is just
00:46:52 okay you mix ketchup and wishes your sauce together and it's like it's like tangier than
00:46:57 a wonder like it's basically the same but like this is the first episode of the new hit youtube
00:47:02 series munchin with munchie oh my god that's a good one that is banded right now trademarked
00:47:09 don't even that's that's gonna be the future that's coming up well hey that that that point that Tom
00:47:14 got to right at the end of that trans woman that that is okay so we could talk all day about specific
00:47:19 things you're not allowed to say but but what's what's interesting to me is the the consequences
00:47:24 of saying the things that you're not allowed to say yeah and specifically uh like yeah it's like
00:47:29 there it seems to me that the way it goes is you say something I don't know like anyone listens
00:47:34 to this podcast decides that something we said is particularly offensive to them or their community
00:47:38 and would then go time right and then they would go begin to cultivate within that we're gonna get
00:47:43 we're gonna get roasted we're gonna get roasted for this no no for this podcast this is like those
00:47:49 those guys who are those guys who are who are who are shitting on them they're gonna they're gonna
00:47:53 be back I have no doubt that we'll all be called very ignorant which I admit to I'm totally ignorant
00:47:59 around subject although I think that philosophically I have found I have ground to stand I just feel
00:48:04 like when people shit on me for thinking this way they're really like reading a lot more into
00:48:09 my opinion than I'm actually saying like they absolutely like they hear they hear me say
00:48:15 that like you know well well how can gender be performative if like a tomboy is still a girl
00:48:20 and they're like well quit being transphobic man live and let live uh uh why do you hate trans people
00:48:27 the fact that they jump from you just like asking a question or trying to examine it they interpret
00:48:32 as an attack on like this identity in some way it's not even that it's because there's I think
00:48:37 it's worse than that I think they they they see it as an attack but I think it's because this is
00:48:41 such a feelings-based thing that this ideology has no logical defense because you'll they'll
00:48:46 be like you need to educate yourself and it's like okay teach me and you know I don't think it's
00:48:52 even I don't think it's even controversial to say that it is all about feelings like there's
00:48:56 nothing else there that's true and I mean I guess there's some studies I guess there's some studies
00:49:00 but the studies are all about feelings you know my whole thing that I said before about how I don't
00:49:05 give a shit about how anybody feels or anyone's you know feelings or whatever like that's only because
00:49:10 that's not out of like uh malice or anything it's because I don't think you can get to truth by just
00:49:14 listening to the way people saying how they feel about shit because all these other things get
00:49:18 bottled in I just want to examine fucking data that as as objectively as possible categorized
00:49:23 I want people to be as happy as possible including trans people and like I don't know like the suicide
00:49:28 rate is really high for trans people even after operation so yeah it's really necessarily the
00:49:32 best way to go yeah I want the best opportunities for them possible and like and like people's
00:49:36 feelings are valid and like people feel the way that they feel and I would never tell someone no you
00:49:41 don't actually feel the way that you say they feel but you can't make sweeping generalizations about
00:49:46 your your feelings in comparison to others because you can't you can't fucking tell another person
00:49:50 how they feel which I really think a lot of this a lot of this ideology really toes the line towards
00:49:56 doing that's the thing the reason but we value facts over feelings even to begin with because
00:50:00 it's easy it's easier to to have feelings than to get the facts right but the reason the facts are
00:50:05 more important is because they're universal right yeah and that's the whole thing because when you
00:50:09 when we start taking feelings super seriously it inevitably leads to nothing because your
00:50:16 feelings are different than my feelings communicate with each other with and understand what we're
00:50:20 saying it's a it's a it's a it's a shared baseline that we can build things off of whereas if we
00:50:25 start taking feelings in consideration I feel different than Ben then feels different than
00:50:30 Nate that feels different than much and none of us could ever get anywhere I don't know that sounds
00:50:34 like fake news to me I don't know yeah there's no red-pilled enough for this fucking truth
00:50:40 there's no basis there's no basis for comparison when we're talking about feelings you know right
00:50:44 so it just gets really complicated and tricky well here's a feeling for you I love you guys
00:50:53 give gave were you saying something there well I was just gonna say I'm pro-phobic I I love homophobes
00:51:00 and transphobes I love fear I'm a big proponent of fear yeah okay let me just say okay we're
00:51:06 talking about homophobes let me just drop a bomb on this things you can't say okay what let me this
00:51:12 is just me giving an example of something that you cannot say or like it's over for you okay here's
00:51:18 here's this thing that I do not actually believe but here I go feel free to cut this everybody
00:51:22 and pretend this is what I actually think for the rest of time okay it is impossible for the white
00:51:28 race to share a nation-state with other races therefore the white race needs their own ethno
00:51:34 state like what do you there there's a lot of people think compelling right that's that's the
00:51:40 alt-right position it is like okay what if you believe that what happens when you believe that
00:51:46 and say that publicly you are you're fucking you're done you get punched in the face and I mean
00:51:50 sidewalk during an interview I don't know because now you've got a lot of friends that are with you
00:51:55 well that that that is true you've got the alt-right movement with you the real one it's not very big
00:52:00 though it's real it's well it's big enough that it scares me so you know that's my feeling
00:52:05 the estimations I've heard is this maybe 15 000 people in the alt-right well okay but you know
00:52:10 what it's kind of like it's kind of like with like the jihadist movement 100 people that's a lot of
00:52:14 people I mean I have I have personally known people who well I mean I don't know I guess they
00:52:19 didn't come right out and say that they're all right but like they definitely had like leanings
00:52:24 in that direction well it's hard it's hard to be white person and not sympathize to some degree at
00:52:29 this point considering considering considering everything's about race now it's like well I
00:52:32 guess I'm a white person so I guess considering everything that we as a people have been through
00:52:40 well okay here's here's a thought uh uh you know the the white race specifically uh like gets gets
00:52:46 lambasted in a lot of ways these ways these days publicly as uh and it's like totally acceptable
00:52:51 to make sweeping generalizations about specifically that race and no others uh but but here's I think
00:52:58 it's totally useless and extremely harmful because that's punching up right right that's that's
00:53:03 punching up right well there's like a statistic floating around that I heard that like 50 something
00:53:07 percent of white people in america feel that they're being discriminated against now like that's
00:53:11 an insane metric but when you hear about but like yeah they're not actually discriminated against
00:53:16 right but then you all these talking points like you're you're culturally lambasted all the time
00:53:20 like Nate just said and of course of course people notice that we just you're just not allowed
00:53:25 socially to say anything about it so yeah it's it's it's really just I gotta say there's there's
00:53:32 definitely there's definitely a frustration when you're just like okay here's what here's what I
00:53:36 feel I am I consider myself basically above even considering the concept of race and it's like
00:53:42 basically useless to me so so here I am just being like okay I'm a human individual and this is like
00:53:48 the individualistic philosophy of just like everyone run your own shit and just like get ahead do
00:53:52 whatever you can do and everyone should just try and I want the people who are the best to succeed
00:53:56 Nate are you in the galatarian because you're not allowed to say that either
00:54:01 exactly but then like but then like okay but then you see I don't know like the neo-black
00:54:06 panthers or just whatever like the islamics or whatever I don't know any like racial group
00:54:10 is right any other racial services group sure I don't fucking know but any any like racialized
00:54:15 group then says like okay uh no like we're here to root for like uh you know I don't know uh
00:54:21 like Arab people like we're here champion Arab people and then okay if they're they're sort of
00:54:27 weaponizing their racial group and then you're over here saying like okay but I don't identify
00:54:31 with my racial group I'm just an individual operator it's like you can't contest them it's
00:54:37 like they are just they just go unopposed in saying that like we need to advocate and they're
00:54:41 like reinforcing thinking along racial lines you know which is an issue I don't know if I agree with
00:54:47 I'm gonna I'm gonna come out and and say something uh that I don't know if you'll
00:54:51 agree with but like okay white white people because they're the minority sorry because
00:54:56 they're the majority or like culturally the majority at least in our culture um they have
00:55:02 they have the benefit of being the the default and they have they have the privilege and it is a
00:55:08 privilege of they have the privilege of like living without thinking about their race whereas
00:55:13 like people in marginalized groups and people in minority groups don't really have that privilege
00:55:17 and they are kind of forced to confront like the reality of race and I don't argue with that
00:55:22 I don't argue with that yeah so so I get it like I get why marginalized groups need like
00:55:29 yeah like it's do you think okay this is what I'm coming from a position of privilege but I wish
00:55:36 they wouldn't do that and that no one ever would like I wish white people and every group wouldn't
00:55:40 like be racist I mean I wish people would feel the need to inculcate themselves in the racial
00:55:46 identity because I think it's all bad yeah yeah it would be nice it would be it would be nice if
00:55:50 nobody felt the need to do that but like right by being by yeah by being in the minority and
00:55:57 marginalized you know I I I get it I get I get the the reasoning where like we got a band together
00:56:03 and like it's like it's like how I it's like how I see people who are religious and everyone's like
00:56:07 oh but yeah like religion is is a helpful tool okay but like even if you talk to like a lot of
00:56:12 atheists like like Stefan Malinu is an atheist but would say like okay religion like is sort of a
00:56:17 support structure that helps humanity and I'm like okay but it's not true and he's like yeah of course
00:56:22 I'm like okay uh so how do we like fix this he's like what do you mean I don't know uh we just
00:56:28 keep doing it it's like okay we can recognize this this this has a place in the world like it makes
00:56:33 sense why it's here but let's just try to get past it as soon as possible let's let's let's let's
00:56:38 leave the shit behind because it is an old thing that drags us down and we should move past it
00:56:43 eventually and I'm thinking about doing that I want to do that as soon as possible that's where my
00:56:47 focus is uh yeah yeah yeah that's what I think about religion religion is interesting there's a
00:56:53 there's a guy Dennis Prager who makes the argument and he's not the first person to make it without
00:56:57 religion Dennis the menace hardcore you know he kind of looks like an old guy this guy's a big
00:57:03 conservative guy Prager University and shit yeah but but he made the point um I mean he's made it
00:57:09 before but I saw it on the Rubin report he made the point that um without without without religion
00:57:14 there's no uh objective morality society like in a social context right so because without without
00:57:22 one fake thing you can't assume belief in another totally right because the the argument is that I
00:57:28 mean he is religious but even like saying even saying that it's like I don't believe in religion
00:57:32 so but even putting that aside like if if everyone believes in something then the entire social uh
00:57:39 construct like the social contract has a baseline of ethics or value systems to work up from it's
00:57:45 the same thing we're talking before about America right that's kind of what America was it was a
00:57:49 baseline that everybody who came here could agree with and work off of um yeah but the argument is
00:57:53 once you take away religion everything becomes subjective because it's just human interpretation
00:57:57 well because that's the reality because in reality everything is and and while it's it's I I'd agree
00:58:04 it's way more difficult to work in that paradigm of saying everything subjective how do we come
00:58:08 to a consensus I think it's more valuable long term but I think the reason religion has been
00:58:12 around so long is because it's an effective shorthand for that yeah it's like of course all the
00:58:18 Christians work this way so in our in our Christian culture this is the value system and we don't
00:58:22 have to think about it anymore we're on the same page inherently it's like it's like I think it's why
00:58:26 Islam is doing so well too because everybody you know to some degree is on the same page it's like
00:58:32 here it's like here with with this shit with these like idea systems and systems of like belief
00:58:36 that really functions control mechanisms uh for like societies it's like you're playing spore
00:58:41 and everyone's playing I like this the greatest game I've ever made yeah like you're playing
00:58:46 and you're playing like on like on the cell level where you're just like eating cells and like okay
00:58:50 we're we're living on the cell level where we just we understand the rules at play here but at some
00:58:55 point you eat enough cells and you grow big enough where where it does it does the zoom out to like
00:58:59 the next level so now we're aware of this like larger context and like you can still play the
00:59:05 little cell game and like you can see that at a much lower level but we're not aware of all this
00:59:09 truth about the larger universe beyond this and and it's time to we need to slowly adjust from
00:59:14 thinking just on that cellular level to the like small organism level or whatever it is and I think
00:59:19 that that's the way that like understanding more of the truth that the universe has to work like
00:59:23 people are stuck down at this like lower level thinking which is like religious thinking but
00:59:27 then we realize that okay none of this is true we need to expand the way we think about all these
00:59:32 frameworks and adjust our reasoning for that I see what I'm saying you're talking about leveling up
00:59:36 my christ consciousness trying to rev up those murkabahs guys
00:59:46 it's like you know life is like life is like that game life is like uh that that mini game at the
00:59:51 end of a level of Kirby where you gotta time your jump to like see how high and it's like just like
00:59:56 who can who can who can who can ride their murkaba to the highest dimension right of course the winner
01:00:01 the winner gets to eat a tasty tasty higher dimensional spirit yeah it's how blitz is Kirby
01:00:08 gonna be that like the lowest level is the root chakra and then the top level is the crown chakra
01:00:13 and that's and that's that's the amount of chakras you're gonna be fucking living off of hey I have
01:00:18 one other thing just one other like idea I want to touch on that relates to just like things you
01:00:22 can and can't say and it's the idea that like in context some things that you can't say normally
01:00:28 you can say and specifically Kirby is what reminds me of this
01:00:32 it's that like so you can say nigger and Kirby well I mean that well you kind of can uh because
01:00:38 believe in the weeb episode season two episode three just came out and it's everyone should
01:00:43 watch it it's it's very good it's very funny please don't but it's like but it's like our friend
01:00:48 at munchie here like the the conceit of the episode is that munchie is the biggest race
01:00:53 realist uh whoever lived and is is is a big fan of the racial slur and yet I don't think anyone
01:01:00 has has come away from watching that video and thought like anything negative about about munchie
01:01:05 and I mean I can't imagine why you would it's it's just so like within the context of the video
01:01:10 it's so ridiculous and over the top and this is like the comedian effect like comedians can get
01:01:15 away with saying things like your average person cannot you know you know what I'm saying and I
01:01:20 just think that's real interesting I would like to this is a good point I don't want to come back
01:01:23 to but I just want to say for the record about the plea in the weeb uh it was it was at like
01:01:28 six three in the morning I've been up for like an entire day and also a year ago and also I'm sorry
01:01:35 I'm not funny I swear to god that I'm funnier now first rule dude no no it's right I'm so sorry I
01:01:45 will say though that I do think you've you've evolved significantly over the past year uh since
01:01:49 rad con too which is which when was your like first pcp entrance I mean you were probably on
01:01:54 one before that but like you became like a main dude after that sometime the first episode I was on
01:01:58 was memes that need to god need to die but I don't remember what my first like I am a member was yeah
01:02:04 okay well but I don't know you're it was after that anyway yeah yeah uh I'm so excellent about
01:02:09 like the context in which you can say things yeah I exist in like a weird like limbo land I live in
01:02:16 california in a big city and all my fans are all yeah all my all my friends are blue pilled as
01:02:23 fuck but the actual town that like I like go to and interact with on a daily basis is super red
01:02:31 pit like like like like like fucking blue lives matter flags everywhere you know okay you can't
01:02:36 walk down the street without seeing a trumpet but blue lives as opposed to blue pilled lives
01:02:40 get confused a lot right okay okay so no matter what I say if I'm if I'm in this town with my with
01:02:48 my blue with my cuck friends which is San Diego right that's that's the city I'm thinking that's
01:02:53 specifically like a small like suburb it's like oh yeah like it is San Diego but like it's called
01:02:59 Coronado it's like a like a like a jump away but like basically it's in the metro area like like
01:03:04 they're the same city basically uh yeah so like like if I were to say something there then no
01:03:11 matter what I would have someone who hates me and it's just like like you just have to play
01:03:16 the mood constantly in whatever context that you're in you know it like if what I'm gonna say like
01:03:21 here beneficial to me because I'm just gonna come out right here and say it like I censor myself
01:03:27 sometimes like while I like realize the value and meaning and saying nigger I realize that like
01:03:34 you know like this will make this will make my friend sad if I say nigger and like you know
01:03:41 like like like saying like fuck you know a generic swear word is incredible and makes you a better
01:03:47 person on average but like going to a funeral only sometimes it only sometimes experiences yeah yeah
01:03:55 only sometimes can you say fuck and like you know like like it only sometimes improves the experience
01:04:03 but I've been kicked out of far too many morgues to continue my hedonistic lifestyle of going up
01:04:08 to random corpses and screaming obscenities you know like like I like say nigger but I just have to
01:04:14 realize the mood and you know like like I'm fine like like I care about relationship with my blue
01:04:19 blue friends more than I care about saying nigger in this exact moment like like in this context I
01:04:25 don't it just goes to show that like feelings is what dictates whether or not these things are okay
01:04:29 or not it's all an emotional state that defines this stuff yeah here's here's like on that point
01:04:34 is like another thing that you know it's kind of like stupid to say like sometimes censorship is not
01:04:39 even a big deal like it like people are just kind yes because like everything it's like you're not
01:04:46 supposed to to say certain things in certain places and sometimes it doesn't even fucking matter so
01:04:51 you know why not who cares like censorship isn't you know I was just trying to be like like like
01:04:57 extra blue pill like censorship is good sometimes like whoa that's something you don't hear that's
01:05:02 something you're not allowed to say a clickbait thumbnail they click on the video it's like
01:05:06 actually a far more reasonable point I mean like when you go and meet yeah if you go and meet like
01:05:11 you're fucking I don't know like you hang out with like your grandparents or something like
01:05:15 you're not gonna act the same way with your grandparents that you do on like your your red
01:05:18 pill podcast on the internet yeah exactly I act way more red pills with my I could you know maybe
01:05:26 there you were just in Germany probably visiting Hitler's great and saluting extensively I walk up
01:05:32 my grandmother all right guys time for another episode of arm retrieval you know Andrew house he
01:05:36 is a fucking nigger hack and he's like oh that much he's at it again yeah you only record arm
01:05:47 retrieval when they're in the room it doesn't make any sense yeah it just it just all follows apart
01:05:53 well I guess we we've gone through a gamut here so what else what else should we touch on before
01:05:59 we end our discussion I would like to talk about we've talked about like like the controversial
01:06:04 you know we're talking about nigger which by the way I just want to say like we've talked about all
01:06:07 the negatives and positives I love saying nigger as demonstrate the thing about nigger is that it's
01:06:12 the it's the it's the word that makes people the angriest so it's the one that you want to say
01:06:17 to piss people off which is why like nigger is such a common word okay can I can I can I
01:06:21 pose a question before we go for any further yeah me too good yeah yeah yeah okay is it do you
01:06:27 because I feel and maybe this is just me and that's why I want to pose the question see if I'm
01:06:30 like crazy or this is totally a thing are swear words and racial slurs the most fanatically
01:06:36 pleasing things to say yes or is that just me like that that is me as well that is like a lot of
01:06:42 it's some I think that the reason they become used as words meant to hurt people is because
01:06:47 they have a punchy sort of feeling to them like cunt you know you call somebody a cunt it feels great
01:06:53 yeah it's just of the way I don't know it's just all those they feel good to swear words because
01:06:58 I kind of hate that because it not not even just because like it gets you into trouble like racial
01:07:03 services do like you want to say them but just like I say fuck so much is because like it just it
01:07:07 feels good to say it yeah it feels great go to kinesthetics unironically I mean I I would I would
01:07:14 imagine that like racial slurs like like nigger wop kike like they're all they were come up with
01:07:19 like probably by like your smarmy sailor types just like leering over the bar at like those people
01:07:25 they don't fucking care for very much thank you very much uh so by christ he's a fucking gooke
01:07:30 he's a fucking wop you know like fuck that guy well well well well well well wop is the sound
01:07:35 that spadey makes me drop it down to the fucking ground like you're gonna drop a fucking italian's
01:07:39 head down to the fucking ground is that true is that where that fucking comes from I'm I'm I'm
01:07:44 fairly certain yet no that the sound of that greasy lock slapping against the floor tiles
01:07:49 wop is an abbreviation I think it stands I think it stands for without passport because they're like
01:07:53 illegal immigrants or something was the original idea that's what I heard like that that one's not
01:07:59 phonetically even um even kraut like like like the world war two thing right you call the germans
01:08:05 the krauts like that has like a consonants like whatever that word is like it has like a punchiness
01:08:12 like a like a sharpness to it any word like that is useful for for sounding like powerful
01:08:18 and in command and aggressive so any any any words that has ever been used to like hurt people has
01:08:24 had that sort of sound in it can we agree at least on this if nothing else that the the nation state
01:08:31 of knee chair must change its name to make me more comfortable looking at the world map
01:08:37 it's the only thing I it's not really dragging down the rest of us with that shit like how
01:08:42 how are we supposed to operate in this blue pill feminized cuck world that I live in and advocate
01:08:47 for every day on my blue pill podcast the pcp that how can I live knowing there's a country called
01:08:53 nigger how can I live with that I just it it tears me up it's truly too much to bear those
01:08:59 black people are the most racist against black people in the world and it's a big problem for
01:09:03 me we should fucking bomb the fuck out of it destroy wipe it off the map kill all people
01:09:08 there just just forget about it indeed nuclear bomb I the reason like the reason I like nigger
01:09:15 it's funny that you bring up like it's like it is the worst so it's funny to make it is the worst
01:09:20 but I don't I don't actually agree with like I like I don't set out none of my actions are
01:09:27 inherently to make other people upset that is usually actually the opposite of what I want to
01:09:33 do oh of course yeah but it's it's like it's the reason they're fun to say yeah because it's like
01:09:38 you're just you're just a ball of like insane energy and like you're obviously not like when
01:09:43 you go on a rant about how Kirby is your fucking nigger forget who in the world would like ever
01:09:50 be offended by such a thing it would be inconceivable to be like that's like we're talking about
01:09:54 context and that's like so important right the context of that has nothing to do with like a
01:09:58 racial insult you know yeah exactly people get so pissed off when you say those words because of
01:10:04 like the con like the historical kind of usage of them yeah but at the same time like it's when
01:10:10 you when you're saying something like that there's no insulting context like is it really more offensive
01:10:16 for me to go up to a black person be like you fucking nigger than is to go up to a black person
01:10:20 be like the color of your skin disgusts me and makes you feel like you're less of a human being
01:10:24 than i am right right dude you should do a prank video okay here's where i where i drop like a
01:10:35 munchy lower bomb because there's actually a reason i use nigger a lot uh in the context that i do
01:10:42 i almost got through the entire show and not saying it damn it i was so close i um this doesn't
01:10:49 happen always because i've kind of fallen off the bandwagon and it's just it's just too fun to say
01:10:53 nigger and i say in context and i let my discipline down however the original reason i i set out to use
01:11:00 nigger a lot is because one like like the most important thing about it is that it's phonetically
01:11:05 pleasing and it's really punchy and fun to say absolutely it's just like how drawing a swastika
01:11:09 just feels yeah it just feels right it just is good yeah but i i i i realize i like like i am again
01:11:17 a blue-pilled cuck and you know i didn't want to make anyone feel bad that i was using the term
01:11:23 nigger even though i just wanted to in the base of my soul so i tried to remove nigger from its
01:11:30 cultural context as much as possible that's the thing right there in the curbie episode there are
01:11:37 no black people i am not saying this like like this african this this fucking slave here i'm
01:11:45 saying this like this like snail this like gross snail monster is a nigger what does that mean
01:11:51 exactly the answer is that it means absolutely nothing and to remove that from its actual
01:11:57 cultural context just makes it a fun thing to say the only way i think that someone could like take
01:12:02 this in an insulting way is they'd be like okay the fact that you're calling a character a nigger
01:12:06 means that you're saying like oh this person is as lowly as the lowly nigger would be like the thing
01:12:11 they're i want to say i'm with you though like what you're doing is robbing it of its insulting
01:12:17 significance yeah yeah i feel the same way because i okay i like the i like the feeling of like being
01:12:24 like an asshole and throwing out insults and like treating people you know like like like i'm so
01:12:29 fucking great i'll call you some i'll just be like you suck peon but i also hate hurting people's
01:12:36 feelings yes me too i know exactly same so exactly so what i so what i often do my favorite insults
01:12:43 are the ones that mean literally nothing that's why my favorite insult is to call someone a fuck
01:12:47 because what does that mean nothing right yeah there's there's that that insult has no content
01:12:52 to it at all my favorite type of insult and like threat of violence are the ones where there isn't
01:13:01 actually any violence being like conveyed yeah like i'm not actually say i'm not actually
01:13:08 saying like i'm going to hurt you my my favorite insults i'm gonna pick you up i'm gonna i'm gonna
01:13:13 pick you up i'm gonna put you down like like like like like what does that mean what does that
01:13:18 mean exactly carries all the attitude it carries all the attitude of bravado of like a threat without
01:13:23 any actual threat being exactly it's like it's like beyond like swearing it's like a post swear
01:13:28 it's like so yeah sometimes what i like doing is is instead of like doing any of that violent
01:13:39 stuff it's just to to wish like a very mild and non-sonic die like like like i like i hope i hope
01:13:46 you stub your toe and then you know you fall over like like something like that wouldn't hurt but it
01:13:51 would hurt you know like it would just like fuck i'm really annoyed that i still you know i think
01:13:56 we all really like utilizing these very like light you know it's kind of magical about those is that
01:14:01 yeah if you if you say i hope you know fuck you i hope you go die like they're just like you know
01:14:06 whatever but you say fuck you i hope you stub your toe and then later they stub their toes like damn
01:14:09 it they did it to me that's true that's true that that that that kind of that kind of sticks with
01:14:15 you i feel like i feel like this post swearing world's a world i want to live in now yeah get
01:14:21 together everybody i cannot wait for the hashtag post swear to cash on i'm so happy
01:14:29 well guys everyone else i mean i feel like we've done a quiet i'm glad that we got to this point
01:14:34 at the end this is this is where i was immediately thinking that the discussion would go i i just
01:14:38 want to comment before on the overuse the idea of angry video game nerd syndrome as as i've titled
01:14:48 the use of using too many swear words okay i view it a lot like legendary pokemon like the
01:14:57 useless terrible yes it yes almost exactly because okay the reason i like swear words
01:15:04 and i think we all do is because they they are special as even though we will say you know
01:15:10 swear words aren't that bad and you know you should be able to say swear words to kids and you know
01:15:14 scream obscenities at your toddlers and that should be okay at the end of the day it's almost good
01:15:21 that they that they that is that gives them their power if i heard it's what i said at the very
01:15:25 beginning yeah well i'm saying i'm i'm saying it better because i'm not you get okay okay sir
01:15:35 on that topic i think the point you're making i watched a little video by by a man named steve
01:15:40 recently yeah it was just about how legendary i was just about to recite that is our piece of
01:15:45 shit and terrible and how you had to fucking search for mute two and the original birds and
01:15:51 dig in deep down deep inside and catch them uh that was the good shit uh stop giving me legendary
01:15:56 pokemon pokemon your your shit okay they really give you a very straightforward in sudden moment
01:16:01 they just give them to you basically yeah yeah wait yeah you get to the end of the game and then
01:16:05 you get them what you have to catch them and the game will not let you proceed until you catch
01:16:09 them so you you are forced to catch them and they won't even object they immediately go in the ball
01:16:14 if you just throw the ball so i guess look i i guess lucario is not a legendary but they just give
01:16:19 you a lucario well that's bad too i want to earn my black and white i forget all right well pokemon
01:16:25 sucks gen two was the best gen two was the best objectively actually gold and soul silver that
01:16:30 is the peak pokemon experience and if something you're not allowed to say i like gen three that's
01:16:36 the good one nobody likes gen three get that is literally the most popular opinion as i say
01:16:41 nate says no one likes gen three i hate those fucking trumpets i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna
01:16:46 go i'm gonna die in that hill oh i'll kill you gen three oh i'll kill you what are you talking about
01:16:52 what are trumpets music and gen three sucked ass those synthesized trumpets it sound like someone
01:16:57 was like farting really high pitch okay they fucking suck that kato what the fuck ever okay
01:17:04 what takes at least six points off the metagame score it does critic score six out of ten too much
01:17:09 trumpets ign reveal anything anything like gen four or later if that's your favorite pokemon
01:17:14 you're a literal baby and you don't matter will you like the day that you're black and white too
01:17:19 black and white too is a great fucking oh you're a baby get the fuck out of here if you're not you
01:17:25 guys into one other how about that gen three is your favorite pokemon game you're you're you're a
01:17:30 literal autistic uh uh uh sixth grader is what i'm gonna say gen four is the best generation
01:17:37 you're objectively no no no i have no respect for you i i'm so fucking elated an option for
01:17:44 favorite gen of pokemon i'm so fucking happy that the the the the big argument was just pokemon
01:17:49 okay we're all on the same page we're all on the same page about trans issues about gamergate
01:18:00 about all of that like that like we've solved that we've solved that we're onto the real problems
01:18:04 now look look all the trans issues and the racist stuff that was the cellular level now we're
01:18:09 moving on to work what does it mean to feel like you're that you like the generation one pokemon
01:18:13 more what does that mean to feel like the discussion about which pokemon gen is is best is so much
01:18:19 more relevant to my life than the trans debates and the trans issues so uh that's why i care about
01:18:24 it to go back what i was saying just to just close this up uh i don't like it when you know
01:18:29 people just say fuck or shit randomly as i demonstrated in the plea of the weeb oh god kill
01:18:35 me the reason that's not cool is because you there is no classroom there's no there's no sense of like
01:18:42 oh god he's saying that word right now he's making me conscious ever to say that now it is important
01:18:48 and it's just yeah like everything you know what i will say if you're if your undertale is like is
01:18:54 is at maximum intensity all the time yeah there will be no peaks and valleys in your undertale
01:18:58 and it'll be a bad undertale so here's i think specifically in media i think that over swearing
01:19:03 had its time like i think i think the angry video game nerd in particular is a great historical
01:19:08 snapshot of how media has evolved with the rise of the internet because if you watch an episode
01:19:13 of south park or something on tv back when the internet like youtube was still a wee babe and
01:19:18 they had like a swearing spree it was just like a bunch of bleeps and it just turned into nothing
01:19:22 whereas you watch like an episode of the angry video game nerd having only been able to watch tv
01:19:26 and youtube being a baby thing all of a sudden this guy's on a screen stringing swears together
01:19:30 that you only hear with your friends like holy shit this is crazy and that was really novel
01:19:35 for a time now it's like past sake because everybody can do it so now we're now we're in the
01:19:39 post swearing uh society makes me feel bad i really i think i think that's true i think that
01:19:45 like i think that like the older generations like are more like baby boomers are really offended
01:19:50 by swear words and like millennials as been saying the ultimate baby boomer you know what's
01:19:56 interesting uh i've actually been getting some comments recently on like unlike my star wars
01:20:00 video for example that i made on my channel um we're like i've distinctly noticed like some older
01:20:05 people you know probably like old school star wars fans like clicked on the video to watch it
01:20:08 where i'm like comparing star trek doesn't matter which i say star wars i meant star trek i meant
01:20:13 star trek um and uh i know i would never talk about star wars grace yeah you cannot say star wars
01:20:19 to me don't say it's all it's all star trek all day uh and i know like i've actually been taking
01:20:25 some notice of this myself how i use the word fuck like a lot all the time just in like my
01:20:30 daily speech and i actually think it's a little bit getting in the way of the message i'm trying
01:20:35 to convey like in my weyagawa videos so i've actually been thinking that i'm trying to actually
01:20:40 reduce it just because i don't like for the for the vehicle that that show is i don't think it
01:20:45 actually like adds to it particularly and i think if it distracts people from the point i'm trying
01:20:49 to make then like i wouldn't want to whereas you know something like uh like but what i will say
01:20:54 is like guys like digi or like i don't know uh like other other youtubers who are just common
01:20:59 like interweaving just the word fuck into the script just you know like once in a while has
01:21:04 become super common and like everybody does it now whereas like older like on tv of course it
01:21:09 would never happen so i i actually like that the words these swear words have been like more
01:21:14 interwoven into everyday usage and to use them sparingly is like not even blinked at people
01:21:19 don't even bat an eye at like just the insertion of the word fuck at like a uh a relatively
01:21:25 appropriate moment and i think that is a very positive way that we're gone i like it i i i
01:21:30 completely agree it yeah i mean swear words they really always have been like um if you want to
01:21:36 be controversial you use them so and now like in the internet you can find all types of different
01:21:42 people you can find you know if i'm in a world on a like a potato cam if i'm in a like a like a
01:21:49 like a place full of red peeled people i'll say something blue peeled to rile them up because
01:21:53 i like doing that i mean it's funny yeah for me it's like in a place full of blue peeled i'll say
01:21:58 it you know maker or whatever it's for me it's like it's like uh it's similar to how i think there
01:22:03 should be a state enforcement to include a certain percentage of like erotic content in all media
01:22:09 i think they should be enforced and the reason is because with increasing control parents have
01:22:14 over their children and how they won't let them go out and just like fuck strangers the way they
01:22:18 used to i think it behooves us to make sure that children are exposed to a certain degree of sexual
01:22:23 content so they know what the fuck's going on this is a literal thing i'm passing legislation in my
01:22:28 state at the moment and we're going to expand it globally soon enough so uh i really like i really
01:22:32 like that's the quotas that people want to see everybody that's what you're going to be saluting
01:22:36 that's the flag you're going to salute in the morning had fucking uh a christmas day everybody
01:22:40 get ready for it what are you gonna do when they start having like uh racial and sexual orientation
01:22:45 quotas in the the the sexual content they expose children to that's just oh no well you know i'm
01:22:53 i'm 100 anti-race mixing i can there could be none of that there could be none of this right okay
01:22:58 yeah that'll be a big problem we'll deal with that when it comes out where are you still here
01:23:01 you'll have a pow wow with richard spencer it doesn't matter it was it was a fucking joke
01:23:05 and i couldn't get in now the time's passed so fuck it oh jeez it poops all of us stub our
01:23:12 toes after this show i hope you stub your fucking dad's toes oh my god he had nothing to do with
01:23:21 this how dare you bring it to me but lay off the dad's you aren't allowed to say that
01:23:26 wow um well guys shall we go to the question now nigger yeah i think he's reached that point yeah
01:23:34 it feels like it okay uh uh everybody oh uh don't forget to uh patron us at patreon.com
01:23:40 slash the procrastinators please please you're in our fan discord please lord for for jesus
01:23:46 lord mercy amen lord knows we're not gonna have monetization on this episode so please make up for
01:23:51 it please oh christ i i just want to shout out that guy uh i don't know who was made like a bingo
01:24:01 card of me and i just want to say briska just so you can cross that out before we move on to
01:24:08 questions i have a i have a question for all you just what you're what's your read on this
01:24:12 okay our opinion on like the whole trans thing are we in the majority or are we in the minority
01:24:18 of what the real majority of like real people right yeah well i don't know i'm like i really am
01:24:25 no i do you know what i think it is i think we're in the majority i just think because of the the uh
01:24:30 the culture uh you're not allowed to say it yeah so it's not presented very off so i guess we've
01:24:37 been punching down pretty hard this episode i would imagine zero point one percent of the
01:24:42 population well they have a loud voice they have a loud ass voice online so i don't feel that bad
01:24:48 i would imagine that like the majority of people who are explicitly against trans people are probably
01:24:55 not as nuanced as we are and while we may be in like the majority of like we're skeptical of this
01:25:02 our exact opinions and formations of our thoughts are probably different i don't know i don't know if
01:25:08 we would be necessarily in the minority i'd like to think i i'm sure i'm sure i'm sure that the
01:25:13 people in the comments aren't going to see it that way it's just i i think literally oh no we
01:25:17 will be dead we are done goodbye i want everyone to be as happy and healthy as possible i simply
01:25:24 do not agree that the methods that these people have selected as the optimum one are necessarily
01:25:30 that and i would like to see more evidence that that's the case i agree that's my position i mean
01:25:35 that's my opinion the reason i overflow with empathy for these people but go on the reason we
01:25:39 would you know reason we were talking about it in in the first place was is because like because
01:25:44 we can't talk about it but that you can't talk about it because they have their claws i mean
01:25:49 not to imply they have claws it's like they're fucking deep monsters but like that's the master
01:25:54 kids who have the claws you just you're just everybody's like like the majority of people can't
01:26:00 speak the the way they want right yeah it's kind of silly but that's right here on the on the pcp
01:26:05 we have an open mic for any ideas all the time well they're they're gonna it's it's gonna be like
01:26:11 those dudes that were fucking around on me on twitter they're gonna say like well you can have
01:26:16 your opinion but you shouldn't say it because it's regressive and because like you're you're like
01:26:21 hurting you're like hurting society by spreading around the way you feel about this issue that
01:26:26 usage of the word regressive really got me that's them just saying like no my opinion is confirmed
01:26:30 the correct one you cannot argue yeah like i said i'm not i said i'm not gonna agree with anything
01:26:36 for the sake of progressivism and then he took that as a as an admission that i was that i was
01:26:41 regressive which it was not oh my god fuck yep i love the the words and that should be another
01:26:47 episode fucking like bullshit semantics that people use i hate that oh god that i couldn't
01:26:52 do an episode on that we got speaking of this but here's a great question i love this one actually
01:26:57 there's a lot going on with this so this is from the twitter everybody we do the thing follow us
01:27:02 at tpcrastinators on saturdays we record so that you see the tweet where we ask for them questions
01:27:07 using the hashtag ask pcp thing we also pull questions from the procrastinators chat so if
01:27:12 you're right of course you get access to the discord server and we'll pull questions from
01:27:15 there more often because you love us and we'll love you back that's how indeed but listen to this one
01:27:21 okay at gabe 11 gabe w underscore 11 asks is it wrong to want to see others not succeed in life
01:27:31 if their career is already heading towards failure oh no there's a lot i think i think that
01:27:38 well i think if i think that's i need a minute to parse that good i think that means you care
01:27:42 about them if you think well exactly if you think that's exceeding at their chosen thing is going
01:27:46 to be bad for them in the long run yeah i think you should i think yeah you should want them to
01:27:51 fail at it yeah that makes sense to me yeah um well i mean i'm trying to think of like an example
01:27:57 where that would not work hey i've got one for you i've got an example of this so there was this
01:28:02 there was this guy who went on the shark tank and he advertised this game and it was called like
01:28:07 boulder ball builder ball it was some like game oh yeah i know i know what you're talking about
01:28:13 yeah like this man had spent like a decade a trying to make this sport an olympic sport
01:28:18 and was like going around had sold his house had had divorced his wife or he like his marriage
01:28:22 had collapsed like his life was in shambles because he was trying so hard and he believed
01:28:28 to a pathological degree you might say that this game was going to be successful and he would not
01:28:32 stop until it became as successful as he wanted to be and like the sharks were like dude you need
01:28:39 to stop this is not going to happen it's not going to work out and it was called bullet ball
01:28:45 i have bullet ball yeah okay bullet ball and uh it was it was a nightmare like he listening to his
01:28:50 story but the amazing thing is ultimately he did find some small success with it in like uh i don't
01:28:57 know exactly how but like he did manage to get a little bit of his toe in the door yeah like it's
01:29:02 i'm seeing that it's it's it's part of the senior olympics now right or it became part of it so
01:29:07 yeah someone somewhere picked it up it didn't become an olympic sport but jesus christ someone
01:29:12 someone maybe he met senior olympics all along it just wasn't saying it i don't i don't know i mean
01:29:15 i'm sure it's a perfectly playable game and i'm sure it's an okay game it's an okay game but like
01:29:20 okay but the question is was it worth it was it fucking worth it did he losing his wife that
01:29:26 depends on the metrics you're measuring like is it personal satisfaction or is it like tangible
01:29:32 asset like i think i think the only reason i think the only reason you should um wish for the
01:29:38 the failure of someone is because if they succeed it will be like actually bad for you in some
01:29:44 tangible way yeah otherwise it shouldn't really be part of you but like i mean if you care about
01:29:51 them and like this is gonna kill them then you know that's that's different but if it's like
01:29:55 they're they're living a worse life but they appear happier like if they're going down a road that
01:30:00 you cut like the sort of drifting apart from you is it really your place to like decide where
01:30:04 their life goes if they like it more i think you have to respect their time like don't interfere
01:30:09 you can hope that if something looks really bad like man i hope that i hope i think it's less
01:30:13 about if it's someone you care about it's less about hoping they fail but hoping they change
01:30:18 directions right you're not right you hope right yeah like if you get some sort of something
01:30:22 improves if you're getting a sadistic pleasure from watching your friends fail like i mean that's
01:30:27 that's not that's you know maybe i guess i shouldn't judge what makes you happy either but like
01:30:31 that's not really like what we want society to be built on so i think that that would be uh
01:30:36 fairly safe to say that's a negative thing to do and you probably wouldn't want to do it um
01:30:43 yeah i think but no i think gibbs right the only time you really want to actively hope for someone
01:30:47 failing is like if you're in for an interview and the person before he's interviewing first
01:30:50 man i hope they fuck it up right right anything like that anything like that that's that's perfectly
01:30:55 reasonable i got a question from the procrastinator's patreon lounge you can donate for just one
01:31:03 dollar uh get in here you can fucking scream as loud as you can and we're all contractually
01:31:09 obligated to hear you yeah it's true um by griffy what is your least favorite i'm gonna
01:31:16 expand this to least favorite and possibly the favorite thing that's happened as a result of
01:31:20 the existence of the pcp uh okay so i mean this friend group or specifically the podcast
01:31:28 i would i would imagine like the podcast i would i would like or the podcast or you know like like
01:31:34 the culture surrounding it as a result of it being a podcast uh i make money my favorite thing
01:31:39 that's the best thing that's true that's not bad yeah the best thing about the pcp is that it
01:31:45 lets me do my other stuff yeah absolutely yeah but i think my favorite thing about it is uh radcon
01:31:52 that was the fun radcon and i mean i mean well i'll take it i mean i do enjoy being on the show
01:31:58 and and hanging out with y'all like i always have fun actually doing the podcast yeah that's my i mean
01:32:04 long before the pcp made money i mean it's no secret that i am the beating heart of the pcp
01:32:10 that keeps this this machine lumbering along and a lot of that i think just came from the
01:32:14 fact that i had moved out to a new city and i didn't like have friends out here or anything i
01:32:19 didn't know anybody and i felt a strong desire to to keep conversation going with these guys online
01:32:25 so like i was always there like let's do it let's fucking do this because like this was my excuse
01:32:30 because like again this was a big thing before the podcast there was like never an excuse to like
01:32:34 getting calls and talk it's true with you guys like you have to be like you guys i'm so sad i
01:32:38 need to fucking talk about i think it's safe to say nate that if you hadn't started the pcp we would
01:32:43 not be nearly as close as we are now i probably would have fallen off the map with a lot of you
01:32:48 just because we don't because we didn't we don't have like a fandom thing to keep us all talking
01:32:52 and stuff like we all kind of went off in our own directions and if we didn't have this to to galvanize
01:32:57 our our group i think it would have would have definitely weakened if not and i it's true i think
01:33:02 some people might be inclined to think i don't know i just want to say like on that point some
01:33:06 people might think that's the mark of like a a weaker bond or a weaker friendship and i just
01:33:11 want to challenge that completely if anyone's thinking that that there is nothing that is that
01:33:15 is the mark of of a group of intellectual gods going to your own thing yeah we're we're i mean
01:33:22 capitalism in general and like the the free market decision to do what you want in life
01:33:27 like allows you to self-select for the kind of people that you want to spend your time with
01:33:31 and interact with and so like like you can't choose your fucking parents you know so like you
01:33:36 should have i don't know i was tweeting about this the other day like you should have standards for
01:33:40 like whether or not you want to continue to even associate with like the people that you had no choice
01:33:44 of being involved in when you were growing up like if your parents are monsters it's perfectly
01:33:48 reasonable to not associate with them and if like you guys were shit i wouldn't hang out with you
01:33:52 but i choose to because they're all my brothers and it's great and i love you all thank you and
01:33:56 like and like even before the pcp made any money or even looked like it might ever make any money
01:34:01 like we were all we were we were like there was never any question of like let's not do this anymore
01:34:06 because yeah i love i love my paycheck from the pcp but i'd do it for free yeah and we did a lot
01:34:13 of us for a long time for a long time yeah well some was part of his question the least favorite
01:34:18 thing yeah as well oh that's true i forgot i want to say my favorite thing was either like like
01:34:24 hippo the rad con too or just recently going out to meet ben that was truly incredible and it was a
01:34:29 great time and it was fun great so it was fucking great uh it was blissful yeah i can't wait to do
01:34:36 it again i mean the worst thing about the pcp as an organization by far is is the kind of issues
01:34:41 that arise just from a group of people working and have clashing ideology sometimes and uh you
01:34:46 know we they may have not have been an incident where someone had to leave you know that wasn't
01:34:50 fun and uh things like that are pretty much stand out as the things you don't want to have to do
01:34:55 for me i think i think we can all agree that this i think i want to say uh i i i i'm sorry monkey
01:35:03 i i i i don't hate you uh but i i feel bad about the whole situation oh yeah it was real it was
01:35:11 real shitty it was real shitty yeah actually i'm mad i was gonna make a joke but then you made it all
01:35:17 serious and yeah i'm just gonna echo that it was you know that oh well here's gib cutting off jokes
01:35:22 how does it like taste in your own medicine i can't even make the joke now because my joke is going
01:35:27 to say the worst part was jeff and i can't even make that it's real got him jeff's career i love
01:35:35 you jeff um yeah the monkey situation make no mistake we were all upset about it awdy and so
01:35:40 none of us were happy about it no no yep yep yep yep it's some of us for different reasons
01:35:45 and others yeah but any of the worst things uh i can't really think of any no i mean that's pretty
01:35:51 great in it yeah everything else is great yeah yeah yeah especially the money yeah i i love every
01:35:58 month this is like it is literally my favorite part of the month to just like calculate the finances
01:36:04 of the pcp and like divvy it up appropriately and make sure and check off my little boxes when
01:36:08 everyone's gotten paid i feel so great about it it is it is a pleasure to do it and uh i just watch
01:36:15 as our financial empire slowly grow and can feel that's my favorite thing it's my favorite you're
01:36:20 always posting like you're always posting graphs of like look at like look at our performance like
01:36:25 look at our revenue yeah look at the upward trend and i gotta say i appreciate it a lot damn right
01:36:30 right it does make me feel like my life is on an upward curve in some way despite everything else
01:36:35 being a dumpster fire it's good to know that there's some glimmer of hope there that's good that's
01:36:41 everyone's saying the generic like oh yeah i i i like money i like money and i do like money
01:36:47 however i want to go with like to the black pilled extreme and say that that that that my favorite
01:36:54 aspect of the pcb that might be my favorite about vanity is seeing people say that they like me and
01:37:00 that i am the best pcp member that's what i striped or yeah whoever someone says that i'm the best pcp
01:37:06 member i know like oh of course that is true thank you very much you're a polarizing figure but you
01:37:11 do get a lot of people saying you're the best and that they're here for you and i will say
01:37:15 social currency is just as fun to collect as the actual currency so you know you're not wrong yeah
01:37:21 i feel like i feel like um i feel like i'm a i'm kind of a dark horse kind of a cult favorite
01:37:26 i feel like i'm not the most popular but i but i feel like there's a like there's a like there's
01:37:31 sizable minority of people that are that are solidly in ben's camp and i appreciate them so much
01:37:38 i feel like i don't know what i'm doing lately but people i've gotten a couple comments who
01:37:42 like oh tom's pretty cool i'm just like yes notice me you know the mysterious satisfaction i need
01:37:48 yeah i i feel like i'm like the the token favorite like everyone has to say they like a hippo because
01:37:54 you know i like you just do anything negative at all like as the the absolute everybody gets
01:38:00 tired of some weird utilitarianism every once in a while or they're you know they
01:38:04 whatever or ben you know like there's only so much trash you can eat out of the dumps before
01:38:08 you take it before but before they just get old but yeah exactly but never you stop the podcast
01:38:14 this episode dead in its tracks twice with like three words great just yeah it was great it was
01:38:19 great so i i certainly agree uh that it's it's great there's a reason you're the one pitching
01:38:24 shows and not us it's because yeah well that's not because i made funny jokes you're like you're
01:38:28 like the the you're like the the blueberries in the blueberry pancakes of the podcast you know
01:38:34 juicy sweet bits that you love it's true you know what i'm saying you know what i'm saying that's
01:38:38 that's what i don't like blueberries oh i don't like you yeah i don't like you berries yeah uh
01:38:47 excellent what was i gonna say oh oh it related to this topic uh there happened to be on four
01:38:53 chan the other day a thread uh it was actually about digi something about mario odyssey i think
01:38:58 or something you know that shit um stupid and within it there a discussion about the pcp emerged
01:39:03 and three individual tier lists were posted as for who were the best i just want to say now this is
01:39:09 four chan which i am a close ally of so it makes sense that they would like me but i was the top
01:39:14 contender on all of them on all of them i was number one so that's not true i was i was the
01:39:21 top contender on a bunch of them i specifically remember that i was a different thread i was
01:39:26 consistently ranked high tier one guy was like liking ben saint and someone else and someone else
01:39:32 came in and shat all over him for his for his deviant opinion who may or may not have been me
01:39:40 you're in every episode it's all it's your show and so and i was going to say though the fact that
01:39:45 i talk so fucking much and i'm still liked is a pretty good indicator that my that the quality
01:39:50 of my average contribution is is good is positive so you know i'm the best we'll see about you're
01:39:56 gonna see about that more than you would like in a few minutes i think you're getting a little too
01:40:01 big for your britches i will say that one time i hosted the show i got a lot of positive comments
01:40:08 and people wanted me to replace you more often so just keep an eye out for that buddy it could just
01:40:13 be that host bump it could be the host it could be the host it could be the host it could be the host
01:40:16 angle for the pcp dictation so hard i'm gonna roll in my communist revolution here you just
01:40:23 yeah oh that was the best part of the pcp no like like saying that tom is a communist and having
01:40:30 everyone agree with me and then being that then him saying like it was what makes you think that
01:40:34 and we're all like oh we don't know we didn't question it was a real strizan effect moment
01:40:43 in the pcp like there was no moment of origin but we were all unanimous that of course this is
01:40:49 the funny thing is i didn't even know it was a thing until we had the the wrestling thing and
01:40:53 everyone's like oh you're a communist like i am why i don't know i don't fucking know it was good
01:41:01 good times all around it was it was um it's because you wear a beret it's like a shake of art you
01:41:11 know that honestly could be a real connection that might be like a real source of the though
01:41:15 that's a tutor cap which is not quite the same but you know it's it's a we don't we don't talk about
01:41:20 the tutor on educated americans they're all the fucking same right right another question from
01:41:26 patreon lounge by the vacuuminator are there any songs you've listened to so much uh at one point
01:41:33 in your life the lyrics have started to inform the way you've lived your life every song every song
01:41:42 from the sponge bob musical um not not lyrics wise but i have listened to a lot of like led
01:41:52 zeppelin songs to the point where i like off of the like off by heart i know exactly how all the
01:41:58 drum solos and guitar solos go and i could play along with them you listen to them on the thing
01:42:03 so much you are the black dog you are the stairway to heaven you are that yes yes i i just hum it to
01:42:12 myself in my brain like every every day like i can i can replay a song a classic rock song in my head
01:42:17 without having to turn on my mpc dude if this were a video game you would be like the designated
01:42:22 npc that like you talk to to begin the bgm playing like a different song in the background after you
01:42:27 collect the item oh my god associated with it that'd be you that's you in real life uh wait what
01:42:31 was exactly the question like have you listened to it so much that you're gay yeah that you turn
01:42:37 into a gay person wait no you talked over to her i didn't actually hear oh that it changes
01:42:42 your life well it informs it informs the way you live your life uh like it changes you and it gives
01:42:48 you new ideas in your old craning there i mean here's i don't know i like i'm hallowing at the
01:42:57 moon a lot these days uh uh like i don't actually know most of the lyrics to like sorairo days the
01:43:04 the garin login main theme but like i know i'm always on about it but like i listen to that song
01:43:08 a lot and it like deeply emotionally moves me every single time i was thinking about like what
01:43:14 my point was going to be that i it's not so much like lyrics of songs yeah like me but just like
01:43:18 the context of songs presented it and kind of just the emotional gravitas of the instrumentation
01:43:23 fucking you're not alone from final fantasy nine is like like that song just evokes such a strong
01:43:30 moment like from that game of like i mean i'm not even going to go into it but it is by far
01:43:35 the most emotionally powerful moment in final fantasy nine and it's devastating i actually have
01:43:39 one you know i do actually have one uh if i can pink floyd's welcome to the machine yeah informed a
01:43:45 lot of uh like like uh coming out of college having to think about looking for work uh not really
01:43:50 knowing what to do and be like yeah now you're in the machine this is what it is all of hybrid
01:43:55 theory informed my my middle school years i'm not gonna lie i bet it was a walking meme at the time
01:44:01 this is a like a little bit of a recent find for me so i i've got to see if it's truly changed my
01:44:09 life but it's uh put in a lot of like like ideas in that i've been cooking in my brain it's like
01:44:15 popped out and you know made me fully understand uh this guy this guy on bandcamp who did like like
01:44:20 homestuck music he's a guy who made the music for s enter he like he's that guy michael bowman
01:44:27 he's a real good singer songwriter guy and he's real is real fancy go listen to him uh
01:44:33 fucking comfortable bugs that's my shit and uh that that's he learned all i love all of his
01:44:38 lyrics and they feel like me there are me has there been a has there been a ceasefire in the
01:44:41 bug wars that allows you to listen to comfortable bugs yes yes yes there has okay and and it's
01:44:48 actually it's it's it's like cultural diversity i'm learning about so many different backgrounds
01:44:52 i'm i'm unsure if this fight is you know good enough to continue oh by the way i just want to add
01:44:57 like on a practical note like that that's serairo days and like like that song in lots of other like
01:45:02 songs that evoke strong emotions in me i actually strategically deploy those songs like during my
01:45:07 runs oh yeah i do as ways to like or like just when lifting to like force my like when i'm like
01:45:14 halfway through a run if i just put on like serairo days like it like the i've been psychologically
01:45:20 tricked it just kicks in in dorphin that just allows me to finish my run like easily so using it
01:45:25 that way to like force my body to just obey its stupid biological impulses uh is very interesting
01:45:31 and uh very fucking funny i do that all the time i like like i only listen to music in context of
01:45:39 would it be cool if like i was in a movie and this song was playing right now to the audience
01:45:43 like what this could be what's happening right now that's the only context i listen to any music
01:45:49 i think i think of all music as like what would what would an s like a home stuck flash look like
01:45:54 with this music yeah yeah what if what if i was having the baby and the baby was you what would
01:45:59 that be what if i was a great arm retrieval right now what would that sound like the baby is you
01:46:06 the baby is you changed my fucking life nothing was ever the same after i heard the baby is you
01:46:11 yeah god it's it's like actually like my favorite album oh and by the way people that that is a
01:46:17 homestuck album made by toby fox yeah it's his greatest fucking contribution to culture you
01:46:22 fucking swine indeed to you got two homes like musically guys check out go do it you fucking
01:46:28 bitch okay how about one more question then we wrap it up okay i i have something far very important
01:46:35 that will you know cut to the core of your very soul and your very being will change after you hear
01:46:40 this it'll be it'll be controversial uh topic like none other by bug fuck no my favorite one
01:46:48 by cuddle to ol in the patreon discord what's the best breakfast i'm gonna go out here and say
01:46:57 that pancakes pancakes without butter specifically or syrup and then and then two eggs is the best
01:47:07 breakfast or alternatively two eggs and a steak i'm gonna bring the breakfast and if you don't
01:47:12 have that then you're doing something wrong i'm gonna bring i'm gonna bring a little class
01:47:16 to this slovenly hole that we all reside in i'm gonna i'm gonna be two my two favorite breakfasts
01:47:22 are as follows one lobster eggs benedict oh my fucking god two i'm gonna knock you down oh the
01:47:29 decadence two uh locks locks bagels with cream cheese tomato onion and capers yeah yeah all right
01:47:38 all right slo mo okay all right buddy that's my name oh wait all of us went to a foreign language
01:47:45 class bed and the best and the best breakfast beverage is two thirds cranberry juice one third
01:47:52 grapefruit juice mixed together with your mix all just ain't you i am fat i'm a breakfast alchemist
01:48:02 is what i would describe my profession uh in stark contrast my favorite breakfast is uh to get a very
01:48:09 small frying pan and put two bits of bacon and two eggs uh just in at the same time and just crush
01:48:16 it around it like crush it and squish it around and then flip it over and it becomes like a
01:48:20 like a like a writhing squidging mess of like a like an omelet pancake like bacon things please
01:48:26 it's like it's like it's like a bacon omelet but it's just really messy and you you end up
01:48:30 like mopping up all the grease wait i've got a problem with that i've got a problem i love that
01:48:34 this sounds great just do it like fry bacon and then halfway through just put in okay i was gonna
01:48:39 say i was gonna say the bacon's gonna take longer to cook so you gotta put that in first but i have
01:48:43 one more there's one more i forgot there's actually a breakfast named after me um named after my real
01:48:48 name uh it's not the ben saint it's the perfect beverage for the chat on the go uh the ben i'm
01:48:55 listening the ben i won't say my last name even though i literally don't care if anyone knows it
01:49:00 uh uh but uh it's coffee coffee with a scoop of chocolate protein powder in it and that is a great
01:49:07 that is a great uh powerful breakfast treat that people people turn their nose up at the ben at
01:49:12 the ben saint guy's last name two two points the wonder you just don't want to say it first first
01:49:18 of all it inspired by that it's a bunch of Polish gobbledygook that's why i don't want to say it
01:49:23 indeed it's a waste of everyone's time inspired by that drink ben i i have made my real name as well
01:49:30 which is just the same thing however it's slightly different and for literal like like kill yourself
01:49:37 you will die of a heart attack uh yes i guess the the toby fox an excellent yes yes an honor as
01:49:44 always to have you here today here's if you want to be awake and also you're a fucking disgusting
01:49:50 fat freak you take a scoop of chocolate ice cream and you put like two shots of espresso in it there
01:49:55 you are going to be awake and also it's delicious i eat it it's a great uh all right all right all
01:50:01 right you idiot it's extremely important about your fucking breakfast extremely important
01:50:05 here's how you eat eggs you crack open the oak so the so the yoke spills out and then you dip
01:50:09 your pancake slash steak into the yoke so it's like a sauce of course that's exactly yeah runny
01:50:14 yokes are central ooh Nate Nate i used to i used to i used to think you were a big fucking weirdo
01:50:19 for liking your your yokes runny but i saw the error in my ways and i would never have many other
01:50:23 way and people if you are cooking your yokes you are just making your life worse just don't do it
01:50:28 you're just wasting eggs they're wasting that flavor don't do it okay uh now everybody shut the
01:50:33 hell up your your suggestions are terrible those are the worst because all that matters is that you
01:50:37 are meeting your nutritional macro goals in your breakfast that's all that matters so here's i'll
01:50:43 give you an option as well uh you have a bowl of oats just fucking steel cut oats you put uh uh you
01:50:49 can put strawberries in the frozen strawberries cook that in that's for flavor if you're a weakling
01:50:53 and need flavor like and that's fine indeed you can put sugar in but that's just extra calories
01:50:58 count those fucking calories you coward uh and then you have a thing of water and chocolate
01:51:02 protein patterns eat that all and i'll give you the option of having black coffee in addition
01:51:08 if you're weak and need that kind of thing to wake up which i i actually do now so uh there you go
01:51:14 that's it that's what you think it's all i have to say on the subject of things you can't say
01:51:18 what about what about what about tom though tom didn't come i'm just i i i actually am starting
01:51:23 to do the oatmeal thing a lot now uh because it's cheap and it's easy and it's fine and i don't care
01:51:29 i want to turn into a machine if i could if i could remove my sense of taste i would do it
01:51:34 it would improve my life dramatically absolutely but when i when i'm a weak boy i'm i'm fan of omelettes
01:51:40 i like making omelettes i make omelettes all the time they're good i need protein because i don't
01:51:44 eat meat because i'm a bitch so that's a good source and that's it protein and beans eat them
01:51:50 i get canned beans all the time it's the best i was doing that before it became a pcp meme
01:51:57 guys i i i would eat beans if you could eat them in an omelette could you do that could you do
01:52:02 like a bean omelette anything in an omelette do you eat burrito yeah no problem no friday burrito
01:52:07 i think they sell those fucking taco bell but beans are just delicious and especially fried or
01:52:12 something they're they're really good it's good shit it's good shit i'm all about the bean life but
01:52:16 i'm lazy and just eat them out of the can because fuck yeah fuck some parents things i don't
01:52:20 know who's got time for that it's like 50 percent of it i just don't want to do dishes later so i'm
01:52:23 like fuck i don't need a dish to get in the dish right here oh yes oh yes i hate no dish life that
01:52:28 no dish life oh dude all right here's the thing you're not allowed to say i like washing dishes
01:52:33 oh my god it's good what even are you i get it i get i can be relaxing it's not the worst thing
01:52:39 in the world and like as chores go it's probably one of my no no no this is where this is where i'm
