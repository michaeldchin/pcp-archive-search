00:00:00 Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh.
00:00:05 I'm supposed to be working right now.
00:00:11 I'm supposed to be working right now.
00:00:16 But I'm not working.
00:00:19 I'm doing nothing.
00:00:22 My dick I'm jerking.
00:00:24 Myself I'm sucking.
00:00:27 I am an asshole.
00:00:30 I am a stupid.
00:00:32 I've got a deadline.
00:00:35 Don't wanna do it.
00:00:48 Hi, I'm Digibro.
00:00:52 Nate wanted me to edit this video because he's trying to edit his video.
00:00:59 And he doesn't want to procrastinate his video by editing The Procrastinators Podcast about procrastination.
00:01:06 So I put it off for a day and a half to play Bloodborne.
00:01:12 Now I'm trying to finish it up.
00:01:16 But I'm just gonna let Jesse's song do all the work for me.
00:01:21 Yeah.
00:01:23 It's quite the burden.
00:01:26 It's a hard knock life.
00:01:28 Being a genius.
00:01:31 Hey everybody, welcome to The Procrastinators Podcast.
00:01:35 I'm Digibro and I am supposed to be working right now.
00:01:40 But I'm not doing shit.
00:01:42 What are you guys doing? Who are you?
00:01:44 I'm Guy. I'm the best guy ever.
00:01:46 You know, it's come to my attention recently that I've been putting a lot of work into these podcasts, eating up like all my weekend time.
00:01:54 So I've been literally, The Procrastinator Podcast has been causing me to procrastinate from my best anime evervids and all kinds of shit.
00:02:02 So how's that for a medic shit?
00:02:04 Likely excused. Hippocrite, what's going on with you?
00:02:07 That's me. I'm Hippocrite and here I am.
00:02:11 What are you supposed to be doing right now?
00:02:14 I'm supposed to. I'm supposed to be relaxing after a hard day's work, but I didn't do the hard day's work yet.
00:02:21 Isn't that the worst?
00:02:23 When it's like, the whole day has gone by and it's like, I don't know, like nine o'clock at night and you're like shit.
00:02:29 I kept pushing shit back and now it's nine and I'm supposed to be done and I still have everything I was supposed to do today.
00:02:36 I need to make an appointment to get my oil changed, my fucking car and I haven't done it for like four weeks now.
00:02:43 So it's not even like...
00:02:46 I guess I can't ask this question. You guys both take a lot of work on your videos, yeah?
00:02:53 Like your content takes pretty considerable...
00:02:56 I just work really slowly in the writing phase, but yeah.
00:03:01 But both of you guys are pretty infrequent uploaders, so that time has really felt strongly.
00:03:09 You know, I feel like guys who must have it good in terms of feeling like they're working all the time,
00:03:17 there's got to be guys like YMS where it's like, it takes them an insane amount of effort to put out their video,
00:03:23 but they still get out one a month, so...
00:03:25 Yeah, that's the dream.
00:03:27 It feels like the amount of work and the amount of time it takes are very equivalent and I bet he feels pretty fulfilled that way.
00:03:36 Yeah, and I bet he's really fucking busy.
00:03:38 I believe him when he talks about how Mahardi works and how he's fucking grinding away all the time.
00:03:43 At the same time, me and DeVu have talked about how we think that YMS possibly...
00:03:50 The way he schedules his work or the way he does it probably takes longer than it needs to.
00:03:56 He seems like his process is overly complicated and that's part of why it takes so long.
00:04:01 He has to do his research. It takes him a while to find all that shit.
00:04:04 It results in good things. Sometimes it goes too far with the Senecti thing that he admitted was bullshit,
00:04:09 but you know, it's a rarity.
00:04:11 YMS is what I say when I go to the doctor and they tell me I have multiple sclerosis.
00:04:18 YMS more like, what a mess, am I right?
00:04:21 Oh, zaydam.
00:04:23 Yeah, it's weird for me because my videos take very little time to make.
00:04:29 I envy that so much.
00:04:31 The thing is that everyone thinks I'm really prolific,
00:04:35 but I could be doing so much more that I always feel like I'm sitting...
00:04:40 The amount of videos I put out, people always leave comments like,
00:04:44 oh, this must have taken so much work and it's like...
00:04:50 I mean, you're talking about editing stuff.
00:04:53 You're pretty quick at writing a whole thing down and then recording it.
00:04:58 Yeah, well, it's that I just have a lot of general knowledge about things,
00:05:04 so it doesn't take me a long time to research,
00:05:07 and I know exactly where to research when I do,
00:05:10 so there are times when I spend more time on it when I go out and try to find interviews and stuff,
00:05:15 but with anime, there's not a lot of that in existence.
00:05:19 With YMS, I imagine he has to go through hours of behind-the-scenes documentaries.
00:05:25 He probably watches all these event...
00:05:28 The After Earth video, I was like, where did you find all this shit?
00:05:32 Yeah, I know, it's crazy.
00:05:33 He's got all these TV interviews with Will Smith and shit,
00:05:36 and I'm like, with anime, you've got the one translated interview that exists on the internet.
00:05:43 Anything that comes out goes through ANN, so it takes five minutes to find it all.
00:05:47 Yeah, I'm experiencing this now, making a video about a game currently,
00:05:52 but the reason that I focused on anime,
00:05:56 I think I generally have more of a historic attachment to anime.
00:06:00 I've got strong feelings for anime, but my point is,
00:06:02 when I was thinking about how to make the channel,
00:06:04 I was deciding should I focus more on anime and more on video games,
00:06:07 and the thing that pushed it over the top was definitely like,
00:06:12 I do not want to have to fucking play a game and get footage and record it and download it.
00:06:16 I'm like, if I could just tour it to show, that's a million times easier, way better.
00:06:20 And right now, I just had to replay to get the exact footage I need this game several times.
00:06:25 It's taken hours, so it's like...
00:06:27 Yeah, that's exactly why I don't want to do more game videos,
00:06:33 because it just takes so long, not just because games are longer.
00:06:36 Imagine you're making a Bloodborne video, and that game, if you make a mistake,
00:06:39 you have to play the whole game again.
00:06:41 It's like, Jesus Christ.
00:06:42 Well, the thing is, for me, I prefer, and I wish more game videos would be this anyways,
00:06:49 and we kind of talked about this in the review rules video,
00:06:51 that I want to see more game videos that are just about specific aspects of a game,
00:06:56 and I think you could get way...
00:06:59 I want to be able to play a 20-hour game once, and get all the footage,
00:07:03 and then make three videos out of it, instead of making one.
00:07:06 And then it would feel a lot more justified, and a lot less...
00:07:10 With the Dark Souls and Bloodborne video I just put out,
00:07:13 it was about very specific things, and it was very general,
00:07:17 so for a lot of it I just used whatever,
00:07:19 and I took 45 minutes of my own Bloodborne footage,
00:07:24 just of showing off all the weapons,
00:07:26 because I just wanted you to have a sense of how they all worked,
00:07:29 and getting a few of the mechanics that I needed,
00:07:31 and then other than that, all of the footage was either from the let's plays that we did
00:07:36 of Dark Souls and Bloodborne, or just cutscene videos,
00:07:40 because every cutscene in the game is online,
00:07:42 so I would just search all the cutscenes, or pull other people's playthroughs,
00:07:46 because those are games that people have a lot of let's plays of, and stuff like that,
00:07:49 so yeah, just sort of cobbling together whatever footage I can find,
00:07:55 but certainly if I was doing a comprehensive analysis of Bloodborne,
00:08:00 I would have to either play through it five fucking times,
00:08:03 and have 70, no, probably over 100 hours of footage to sort through.
00:08:08 Like at the very least, if you want the three endings,
00:08:10 that's three playthroughs right there, and you can't go back, there's no going back.
00:08:15 The whole recording a lot of gameplay footage is the entire reason why GRPG exists on my channel.
00:08:22 Right, right, because you have it.
00:08:24 Well, I mean, I don't want to record a whole GRPG, because they're like the longest games ever, for a review.
00:08:31 Oh, you meant because you don't have the footage, because that's the show where you don't show anything.
00:08:34 Yeah, I don't show any footage, it's an excuse.
00:08:37 Oh, right, okay, I see.
00:08:39 For other things, I would just play the whole game, and since they're not usually too long, it'd be like, I don't know, nine hours.
00:08:47 I do think a lot of people are being like, because I know that, and Nate,
00:08:52 I know you're the kind of guy who you really want every video to be like your perfect vision, and to be like a perfect video.
00:08:58 True, but that doesn't mean it's an all-encompassing thing.
00:09:00 Yeah, and I think it's overboard with a lot of people, because I think we've gotten to a point where YouTube videos,
00:09:08 they have to impress you, but they don't have to be perfect anymore.
00:09:12 I think there was a time where if you wanted someone to sit down for 20 minutes, then you had to be sequelitis and really blow their mind with animation and stuff.
00:09:20 But Noah Caldwell-Gervais, that dude does 45-minute videos with no editing in his audio,
00:09:27 and the video is like, you can tell that he'll just turn on a game, play it for 45 minutes, and then just slap the footage he has in there.
00:09:35 It very rarely matches up to what he's saying, which as a result for me, I don't usually watch the video,
00:09:41 and therefore I usually completely lose track of what he's saying, because it's so unedited that I just can't possibly give a fuck.
00:09:48 So what we're saying really is if you want to get your own obstacles out of your way, if you're going to do something like this,
00:09:56 my approach is obviously the wrong one for making YouTube videos.
00:10:03 I don't know that it's the wrong one, it's just that I'm just saying that these days you can do less and get away with it.
00:10:10 Ultimately, the reason you're doing your videos that way is not to do it smart, it's because it's what you want to do.
00:10:18 That's right, I got a job when I work at it, so that I can make the videos that I want to make.
00:10:22 Because if you just wanted this to be a business decision, then you would just fucking make 5-minute chunk videos.
00:10:28 And make fucking Digi Bro videos. Nobody wants to do that.
00:10:32 Well, that's the funny thing, because in the month of January, I finished writing and doing all the audio for my Asterisk War series,
00:10:40 and they're all being edited by the DeVue.
00:10:43 So in January, all I had to do was let him make videos for me, and I was going to make enough money off of those.
00:10:52 As long as he made 3 videos, I'd make enough, and I knew he would do that, even though I have to pay him,
00:10:58 and I made a decent amount through ad revenue.
00:11:01 I should be doing a lot more, because I should be trying to have a buffer of money.
00:11:06 I should be trying to make enough money that I can save some, or think about my future and put some money into my future.
00:11:12 But I was just like, eh, I can skate by letting DeVue edit 3 videos for me.
00:11:17 I put out some stuff that was all non-patron videos, stuff that wasn't deep enough for me to patron it,
00:11:25 because I'm very particular. I'll only patron something if I think it's up to snuff.
00:11:30 So then this month, it was like, alright, I gotta get back in the game.
00:11:34 I gotta actually make one of my own videos, and I wrote that Dark Souls in Bloodborne 1,
00:11:38 and I was so scared of editing it, I was like, oh, it's going to be a nightmare.
00:11:41 The video was like 12 minutes long, and the editing took like maybe 4 hours.
00:11:47 Oh, that's a dream.
00:11:49 But there was so much more of me putting it off, because I thought it was going to be so much worse than it was.
00:11:54 I was like, oh, I can't possibly, I'm going to need beer, and I drank half a beer,
00:12:00 and then did the whole first half of the video in one sitting, and I was like, oh, that wasn't so bad.
00:12:05 A lot of it is just starting is the hardest part.
00:12:11 That's definitely true.
00:12:13 It's a lot worse when you don't know exactly what the footage is going to be,
00:12:17 or what you're going to have to put in there, because when you know exactly what it's going to be,
00:12:22 because me and Davoo have both taken up this method where we download everything we need before we start,
00:12:28 and then it's helpful in two ways.
00:12:31 Firstly, that you can just plug everything in very easily,
00:12:34 and secondly, that it's incentivized for you to finish the video faster,
00:12:39 because you need to get all these fucking files off your computer.
00:12:43 For instance, the Hideaki-Ano video, where there was footage from everything he ever worked on,
00:12:48 so I downloaded every single thing he'd ever done, and I knew exactly which clips I wanted for which part.
00:12:54 So editing that didn't take very long, in spite of how long the video was,
00:12:57 because I had all the clips right there, and I needed them off my computer.
00:13:02 That is a very wise way of doing things.
00:13:05 I usually find myself downloading materials like that,
00:13:08 but I pretty much always just try to get what I know the base thing I'll need,
00:13:12 like game footage or the whole show, or whatever that's going to be,
00:13:16 and then just the way that I do shit, I end up editing in a lot of extra shit,
00:13:20 so I have to go through all that whole process of downloading and waiting.
00:13:23 That's what I used to do, because it used to be that I'd get to a point in the video
00:13:27 where it's like, okay, well, nothing in the show really reflects this,
00:13:30 and now I've got to go find something else, so now when I first start, I'm like,
00:13:33 alright, this clip, this line in the dialogue I know is not in the show.
00:13:38 Let's go find a clip before we start editing, because it really takes you out of the groove
00:13:42 of editing when you're putting shit together, and then suddenly you hit a roadblock
00:13:46 and you don't have the footage, and you have to go find it somewhere,
00:13:49 and it's like, you completely stop what you're doing to go make something else.
00:13:53 Man, it's just, I do that, my whole editing process is just a continuous series of that.
00:13:59 Yeah, that's what it used to be for me, and I'm glad that Me and DeVu sort of changed gears a bit,
00:14:04 and now the only stuff that he really has to, because he puts together a document
00:14:09 for all these Astroscore videos where he'll write down everything he'll need for each line,
00:14:14 and then me and him go through it and find all this shit, so if there's a bunch of shows that he...
00:14:19 because there's a lot of, I make references to lots of things that he doesn't know,
00:14:22 because he's not an anime fan, or not a long time anime fan anyways.
00:14:26 I've been wondering how he dealt with that, not really, yeah.
00:14:29 Well, in the early days, because a lot of the older videos he did for me,
00:14:33 it was interesting because he would use stuff that I'd never even seen before.
00:14:37 Like, in the one where I explained what is anime and what isn't,
00:14:41 he brings in all these Tizuka clips from shows I'd never heard of,
00:14:44 because he was doing his own research.
00:14:46 I would write the video, and then he would have to go re-research the video
00:14:50 and learn it all for himself, and it had some interesting results,
00:14:55 but for these Astroscore ones, when there's parts where I'm like, you know,
00:14:59 there's, I'll say something like, in other generic anime of this type,
00:15:04 you know, and then he has to ask me, okay, what are other generic anime of this type?
00:15:08 I'll give him a list of like five shows, and he'll go download clips from those shows.
00:15:11 I'll come to you sometimes, and be like, did you, I need like a super robot moment,
00:15:16 like what can I use? I did that a couple times with the grown login one.
00:15:19 Yeah, for the getter robo clips.
00:15:21 And the G Gundam, which was actually one of my favorite moments in that whole thing.
00:15:25 Man, the fucking King of Hearts, holy shit, that was like the coolest thing that ever happened.
00:15:29 That was amazing, yeah.
00:15:30 I need to watch that show, and I don't want to sink fucking, what, like 24 hours of my life
00:15:34 into watching that show.
00:15:35 Yeah, it's fucking long, it's like 50 episodes.
00:15:37 It's 50 episodes, so 16 and a half hours, probably, 17 hours.
00:15:40 That's a long ass show for not needing to be.
00:15:42 You can skip a lot of it, like, there's a lot of episodes that if you can tell early on
00:15:47 that it's not going to be, like, because there's a lot of just stupid one-off episodes.
00:15:51 Hey, this is a good example of something that incentivized procrastination,
00:15:55 because I'm the kind of guy who is really uncomfortable with skipping anything in a show
00:16:00 when I'm going to watch it.
00:16:01 And as a result, I keep being like, I'll do it later, I'll get to that.
00:16:05 I wish that I'd seen G Gundam by now, but I haven't, because I've got this obsession
00:16:10 where I'm like, I have to watch it all, it's 50 episodes, it's a long ass time.
00:16:14 For me, it's all about measuring exactly how much do I give a fuck
00:16:19 and how much am I going to miss out on, because unlike you, I spoil myself for a lot of stuff.
00:16:24 And a big part of that, I make it sound sometimes like I just go out of my way to spoil myself,
00:16:30 but it's more like I hang out in the community for long enough
00:16:33 and you're going to get spoiled for everything.
00:16:35 Like, there's not a gamer alive who doesn't know about Eris dying in Final Fantasy 7
00:16:40 because it was spoiled like a week after the game came out in a magazine.
00:16:44 So if you even read gaming magazines, you'd know.
00:16:47 A bunch of cock knobs, we'd do that, fuck them.
00:16:50 And it became like a really infamous spoiler that everyone knew it.
00:16:53 So like no one's going into that game not knowing that.
00:16:56 And like, there's a lot of stuff that I just glimpse on TV, because I grew up,
00:17:00 G Gundam was on Cartoon Network when I was like 13.
00:17:03 So like I'd seen a bunch of it, I got the point, you know.
00:17:08 And so when me and my friend finally like marathoned the whole show,
00:17:11 then there was a lot of episodes where we'd be like,
00:17:13 oh, this is an episode about Neo-Mexico, which is never going to be relevant again.
00:17:17 Yeah, let's skip that, you know.
00:17:19 Because a lot of them are like...
00:17:20 That's racist dog, that's racist.
00:17:22 Well, a lot of them are like really corny sob stories.
00:17:25 You know, it'll be like, oh, Neo-Mexico's sister was captured by the cartel
00:17:30 and he has to fight and then it gets all emotional.
00:17:33 Oh my god, Jesse Wood joins us.
00:17:35 Wow, that's really funny.
00:17:37 Oh, hey, what's up?
00:17:38 Alright, Jesse.
00:17:39 Now we got to sync our audio with Jesse Wood.
00:17:42 Alright, on the count of three say procrastination.
00:17:46 One, two, three.
00:17:48 Procrastination.
00:17:50 That sounded terrible.
00:17:52 Jesse, what have you been procrastinating on joining the podcast by doing?
00:17:58 I want to die.
00:18:02 You can't escape the dream through death.
00:18:05 Is that an answer?
00:18:06 No, I guess it's not.
00:18:08 Are you saying you're procrastinating on dying?
00:18:11 Yeah, just do it already, faggot.
00:18:13 Procrastinating on life because I'm dead inside.
00:18:17 I do like the idea of, you know, I've been wanting to kill myself for years
00:18:21 but it's just so much effort to load the shotgun.
00:18:24 Well, that's not quite exactly the reason that guys like Sato and NHK don't do it.
00:18:29 But at times they're like, man, I just want to die but it's such a fucking bother.
00:18:32 I don't want to go through all that shit.
00:18:34 That's a different sort of thing, I guess, though.
00:18:36 Man, let me tell you guys, I have been the least motivated to do anything that I've been in years.
00:18:45 It's been swell.
00:18:47 And by swell, I mean it's been hell.
00:18:49 Hell in a swell.
00:18:51 I've been pretty unmotivated myself.
00:18:54 Well, you know, I was telling that story earlier, Jesse wasn't here,
00:18:59 but I was talking about how in January DeVue had all my work covered, so all I did was play.
00:19:04 It was kind of cool because I finally got around to playing all the Souls games
00:19:08 just because I didn't feel like I had to do anything and I was like, fuck it, I'm just going to do this.
00:19:12 It wasn't even like, I thought I was just going to play Bloodborne and then play the Witcher 3
00:19:19 because those are the two games that I really wanted to play.
00:19:22 And then I got so hooked on Bloodborne that I was like, I have to finally do Dark Souls.
00:19:26 And then after I did Dark Souls, I was like, I have to finally do Demon Souls.
00:19:30 And then you got to Dark Souls 2 and you're like, I do not have to play Dark Souls 2.
00:19:34 That's exactly what happened.
00:19:35 I'm still struggling with it.
00:19:36 I kind of want to try to play the PS3 version and see if it's less frustrating than Scholar of the First Sin,
00:19:42 but I suspect it's not.
00:19:43 I thought they'd have made it better because it was already pretty shit in the original version.
00:19:46 Yeah, well, they tightened up a lot of things, but they also added a lot of enemies.
00:19:50 I don't want to talk about Dark Souls 2, it's stupid.
00:19:52 Yeah, I do want to talk about what I want to talk about.
00:19:55 What I want to talk about is a better game than Bloodborne, which is a piece of shit.
00:19:58 Oh no.
00:19:59 How can you even say that shit?
00:20:00 How can you say that in my life?
00:20:02 Jesse is an advocate of, he's a star.
00:20:05 It'll be okay.
00:20:06 Jesse will beat Bloodborne one day and he'll like it.
00:20:09 You know what?
00:20:10 I don't even want to argue.
00:20:12 You're right.
00:20:13 It's the best game ever.
00:20:14 You were singing about how tough the heart it was and how much you loved it,
00:20:17 raping you in your face constantly.
00:20:19 Who are you?
00:20:20 What happened to that handsome young man?
00:20:21 Shut up.
00:20:22 Who is this guy?
00:20:23 No, but Jesse did make a good point earlier,
00:20:26 because I knew the answer to that when I said,
00:20:29 we were arguing earlier for the people listening to the podcast,
00:20:32 and I said, what happened to the guy who sang the song about liking games
00:20:36 that are hard in the Demon's Souls video?
00:20:38 And I know exactly what happened to him.
00:20:41 He got older and doesn't have time for shit anymore,
00:20:44 and isn't into doing that, which is the same for me.
00:20:48 That's why I've always said that I don't think any game is hard if it's a good game,
00:20:55 because the only thing that makes a game hard is that you have to learn how to play it
00:20:59 and do the same thing until you know what to do.
00:21:04 The hard thing is just having the patience for it and wanting it.
00:21:10 I guess there's some games that are probably just so hard in terms of dexterity
00:21:15 that if it's a certain kind of platformer game
00:21:19 where you just have to be able to move your hands fast enough.
00:21:23 DDR is hard for really fat people.
00:21:25 Yeah, I'm completely uncoordinated, so DDR is really difficult.
00:21:30 I mean, I guess I could eventually learn it,
00:21:32 but I don't know if I'd ever be able to move my legs that fast
00:21:34 without literally beefing up myself and getting strong for the sake of DDR,
00:21:39 which again would make it easy.
00:21:41 It's just a matter of what you're willing to put yourself through.
00:21:44 I no longer have the patience for anything.
00:21:48 I hate exerting any effort whatsoever for anything.
00:21:53 I hate doing anything or having to do anything.
00:21:56 I can't stand learning new things.
00:21:59 It's like poison to me, the concept that I might have to learn something new
00:22:04 or read a set of instructions or work my way around something.
00:22:08 Just for this very podcast, I had to go figure out how to make audio
00:22:14 two keyframe transitions and animate that thing.
00:22:17 I don't even know what that is.
00:22:19 I taught Demu, I showed them the shit.
00:22:22 Look at us, Jesse, we're all learning things.
00:22:24 You gotta get out there and mix it up.
00:22:26 With Bloodborne though, because I didn't play Bloodborne for all that time
00:22:30 because I thought it was too hard.
00:22:32 I played it when it first came out and the loading screens were really, really bad.
00:22:37 Every time I died, I was just like, I don't want to play this anymore.
00:22:40 The loading screens are way too fucking long.
00:22:42 The reason I ended up playing it was just that I learned everything about it
00:22:46 from watching Victor play and watching other people play.
00:22:49 I was like, well, what I came to realize is that that game is so much fun
00:22:53 just to play that I didn't even care if I made it anywhere.
00:22:57 I figured that I could just play every level over and over again
00:23:02 and it would always be fun because the combat is fun.
00:23:05 That's kind of what I did.
00:23:07 I just played through the first area until I was so overpowered
00:23:10 that there was nothing that they could do to me.
00:23:13 Then I went to the next area and I played that until I was so overpowered
00:23:16 that there was nothing they could do to me.
00:23:18 Then by that point, I was so overpowered that the entire game was easy.
00:23:22 I never had to fight a boss more than three or four times at the absolute most
00:23:27 and just kind of steamrolled the whole game.
00:23:30 There was a guy in a...
00:23:32 No, go ahead.
00:23:33 Well, what I was trying to talk about ages ago
00:23:36 is conversely to all of you who are all feeling very unmotivated.
00:23:41 I have recently become...
00:23:42 I'm not feeling unmotivated.
00:23:43 But you said you were.
00:23:44 You said you were unmotivated for stuff.
00:23:47 I never said that shit.
00:23:48 They were saying it.
00:23:49 I never heard that.
00:23:50 Jesse, I think.
00:23:51 Whatever hippo.
00:23:52 I don't...
00:23:53 I have become much more motivated to do stuff
00:23:59 like progress in some sort of work every day, much more recently
00:24:03 than I have ever in my whole life.
00:24:06 I've been going into...
00:24:08 I've got a university and I'm doing an animation for my final film.
00:24:14 For my final year.
00:24:15 You know what I...
00:24:16 And I've been going in every day to the library to work on it from,
00:24:21 I don't know, like 12 to 6 and then coming back and then playing games
00:24:25 and it's been cool.
00:24:26 Oh, that's the dream.
00:24:27 You know, hippo, I remember a few years ago
00:24:31 when you were always talking about how unmotivated you are
00:24:34 and a lot of the problems you had.
00:24:36 And I kept saying, you're going to turn 22 or 23
00:24:40 and then you're just going to suddenly be motivated.
00:24:43 Yeah, yeah.
00:24:44 I am 22 now.
00:24:45 Yeah, because I remember having this conversation
00:24:48 because I felt the same way.
00:24:49 And then you'll turn 26 and you'll never be motivated again.
00:24:52 Well, because when you're up until your early 20s
00:24:57 your brain is just not finished developing yet.
00:25:00 And for me, when I was a teenager and when I was 20 and 21
00:25:05 I just had no desire to do anything.
00:25:07 And then it just kind of clicked and I was like,
00:25:10 oh, now I want to do stuff all the time.
00:25:14 Now I don't ever want to not be doing something.
00:25:16 Well, it's not that I love doing stuff.
00:25:20 I do love doing stuff, but it's always been difficult
00:25:23 to get into that groove.
00:25:25 Yeah, the mindset.
00:25:27 So I've just been figuring out how to force myself into that mindset.
00:25:31 Getting into a pattern like that is the best thing.
00:25:35 The most productive time of my entire life, by far,
00:25:38 was when me and my brother were doing T-Bab episodes
00:25:40 every Saturday morning.
00:25:41 We would crank those motherfuckers out.
00:25:43 And we were highly motivated.
00:25:45 We were fucking achieving our dreams.
00:25:48 It was awesome.
00:25:49 As unmotivated as Jesse is,
00:25:51 he is still producing a lot of content without even trying to.
00:25:57 I should rephrase it.
00:25:59 It's not that I'm unmotivated.
00:26:01 It's that I'm sick and tired of being motivated.
00:26:04 And I wish I could be unmotivated.
00:26:06 It's like an addiction.
00:26:08 Creativity is a serious addiction for me.
00:26:10 I can't stop it.
00:26:12 That's kind of how I felt when I played all the Souls games.
00:26:15 It was like I had to physically rip myself away from that obsession
00:26:20 with I have to be making something.
00:26:23 It just gets me to a point where I just realize
00:26:28 it's too much effort to organize my thoughts
00:26:33 because my thoughts are like a swirling ball of chaos.
00:26:36 It takes effort to organize it into concise little videos and shit.
00:26:41 And I realize it gets to the point where
00:26:45 I'll never be able to make videos as fast as I can write videos.
00:26:49 So no matter what I do,
00:26:51 I'll always have a backlog of 50,000 fucking ideas that I want to do.
00:26:55 So eventually, I just got to say,
00:26:57 someone come here and kill me.
00:26:59 Come to my house and put a gun in my asshole and pull the trigger.
00:27:02 If that really is an issue,
00:27:05 you should consider getting an editor or something.
00:27:07 I don't know how that would work.
00:27:09 For me, for all the time you see videos coming out on my channel,
00:27:14 all the time I'm not making them is me obsessing over what I should be making.
00:27:19 Every time I finish a video, my immediate thought is,
00:27:22 okay, what's the next one?
00:27:24 And then it's just this long period of figuring out what the next one is.
00:27:28 There's no celebration when you post a video.
00:27:32 There's a window of a couple hours after we're at peace.
00:27:37 There's a window where I...
00:27:39 For me, it's as long as the comments last.
00:27:42 Because basically, comments typically last about two days
00:27:46 before you stop getting new ones or they slow down considerably.
00:27:50 And there's that initial point when you post a video
00:27:54 and then you get a couple hundred comments,
00:27:56 at least for me I do because I get a lot of comments on my videos,
00:27:59 and that early period where I'm just reading all the new comments
00:28:02 as they come in and responding to them really actively,
00:28:05 that's the big come period where it's just like,
00:28:08 okay, I have finished this thing, it's done, now I get to enjoy it.
00:28:13 My sense of peace only lasts until I see the first comment.
00:28:18 That's a window we can believe in.
00:28:22 Well, most of my comments are positive,
00:28:26 so for me it's always like...
00:28:28 Because by the time I'm done with the video,
00:28:30 I've always totally lost faith in it because I've now heard it 20 times
00:28:34 and I'm questioning it already.
00:28:36 So with the Dark Souls and Bloodborne one,
00:28:39 I guess another way to put it is that I become so familiar with the idea
00:28:43 that it doesn't seem like a revelation to me.
00:28:45 It seems like something I've known forever.
00:28:47 All the time.
00:28:48 So I put it out and I'm like, what the fuck?
00:28:51 Everyone knows this clearly.
00:28:53 And then it's not until people start commenting
00:28:55 and they're like, wow, you really opened my eyes.
00:28:57 I never thought about this and I'm like, okay, cool.
00:29:00 Yeah, that's a relieving thing to say.
00:29:03 I legit thought my both girl and Logan videos were complete garbage
00:29:07 when I released them.
00:29:08 My friends are just going to make fun of me.
00:29:10 What was I thinking releasing this piece of absolute trash?
00:29:14 No, they were great.
00:29:15 It came out okay though.
00:29:17 But I don't feel like I'm the arbiter of if my videos are even good.
00:29:21 I guess nobody is.
00:29:23 Yeah, I mean, we all kind of feel like that.
00:29:25 I feel like that every time I make a video.
00:29:28 It's one of those things.
00:29:30 You just got to have people reassure you that it's actually cool
00:29:34 because they haven't seen it yet.
00:29:36 You got to gaze into the void and then hope it gazes back favorably.
00:29:39 You've been spoiled for your own content.
00:29:41 I definitely have a lot of...
00:29:42 I am the arbiter of whether or not my content is good
00:29:45 because who the fuck is going to know
00:29:47 whether or not I achieved my goals better than me?
00:29:49 That's true.
00:29:50 It's not like I trust anyone else's judgment over myself,
00:29:52 but I just don't trust my judgment either when it's being released.
00:29:55 Who's opinion am I going to take on my videos?
00:29:58 My commenters? My commenters are fucking scum.
00:30:00 They're idiots. They're morons. I hate them all.
00:30:03 I have two different types of videos
00:30:06 that I have the ones that I know are good because I like
00:30:09 and I have the ones that I'm okay with because everyone else likes them.
00:30:13 All of my really long videos, I deeply love
00:30:17 and I don't care what anyone else thinks.
00:30:19 My psychopaths videos never got a whole lot of attention,
00:30:22 but I thought they were the best things I'd ever written
00:30:25 and I still think they're better than anybody else's content, you know?
00:30:29 I make no qualms about judging my own stuff against everybody else's.
00:30:34 I wouldn't do that in a video because it would look incredibly arrogant, you know?
00:30:38 But like...
00:30:39 I've made videos right now.
00:30:41 Yeah.
00:30:42 Well, it's not like a top ten video.
00:30:46 Like when I did my top ten videos, YouTube videos of...
00:30:49 Top ten people. Did you think sir? Shit.
00:30:52 Right. If I had done that and I included my own work,
00:30:55 then it would have had my psychopaths theories in it.
00:30:58 It would have definitely had the Hidey Ikeano videos in it.
00:31:00 It probably would have had my Evangelion analysis in it.
00:31:03 You know, maybe even my Nanoha one.
00:31:05 I almost wish that you had done that just so people could watch that
00:31:08 and be like, wow, fuck this guy.
00:31:10 Right.
00:31:11 Yeah, it would have been funny.
00:31:12 Maybe you should release a corrected version with just your videos.
00:31:16 I mean, I make my videos because I want someone to make something that I want to watch.
00:31:21 You know, it's like the whole point of me doing them is
00:31:25 no one else has done this idea yet and this idea is what I want to exist.
00:31:29 So I have to do it.
00:31:31 You know, I've had plenty of videos that I...
00:31:34 I've had plenty of videos that I didn't do specifically because someone else did it.
00:31:38 You know?
00:31:39 Right.
00:31:40 Like I would never want to do a video on Aldenoa Zero because
00:31:43 between demo and anime addicts, they both did great ones.
00:31:46 Although anime addicts channel has completely been taken down by YouTube.
00:31:50 So I...
00:31:52 Because he was a guy who like, he did a bunch of great videos
00:31:55 and then like quit because real life got in the way and he went off to go become an engineer.
00:31:59 And then I think in the time since he stopped doing videos,
00:32:03 he got three strikes and his channel got taken down.
00:32:05 Just didn't pay attention or something.
00:32:06 Yeah, while he was gone.
00:32:08 So yeah, like we've lost the best breakdowns of Aldenoa Zero
00:32:13 and what's it called?
00:32:15 That fucking... that Watanabe show that wasn't good.
00:32:18 Zankono Terror.
00:32:19 Oh yeah, yeah.
00:32:20 He had great videos on those and they're gone now, but like...
00:32:22 Too bad.
00:32:23 I wouldn't want to cover something that someone else already did a great job on.
00:32:26 I cover it because I don't think anyone else has said what I want to say.
00:32:29 And so it only makes sense that those would be some of my favorite videos
00:32:33 because it's something I wanted to see.
00:32:36 That's true.
00:32:37 Yeah, generally, I generally don't look at the reviews of the games that I want to talk about
00:32:42 because I just want to talk about them.
00:32:44 It's never really... I want to, you know, make a big splash with this one
00:32:49 or I want to blow people's minds.
00:32:51 I just want to talk about the games I like.
00:32:53 You got to shoot for the moon because even if you miss, you'll land among the stars.
00:32:56 Oh, I never thought of that.
00:32:59 Yeah, yeah.
00:33:00 But, you know, it's just...
00:33:02 Something about the way... well, never mind.
00:33:04 I was going to make a Bloodborne reference, but you're not far enough in the game.
00:33:07 Nothing is...
00:33:08 I've seen the whole thing.
00:33:09 Relieving to me, then when one of you guys is going...
00:33:13 says you're going to make a video on something that I also want to make a video on
00:33:17 because I feel like I can trust you all to make a good video on it, and then I don't have to.
00:33:22 Oh, I've had a lot of...
00:33:23 I've told Nate...
00:33:24 I've told Nate that he's going to do a fucking Undertale video.
00:33:27 I'm like, thank God, take all my Undertale notes, throw them in the fucking trash, throw a match in it, because I don't care.
00:33:33 Yeah, no, I told Nate before that, like, uh...
00:33:36 I mean, that's also why I didn't do an Undertale video, because when I played it, I was like...
00:33:40 Oh, man. All this pressure.
00:33:42 It's going in the trash.
00:33:44 When I played through the game, I was like...
00:33:46 I feel like I could knock something out on this really quick, and it would be...
00:33:50 It would get a lot of attention, but I didn't want to undercut Nate,
00:33:53 because I felt like he would say all the things I said, but do a better video.
00:33:57 I promise it is coming.
00:33:59 I'm working on it all the time.
00:34:01 So, like, immediately...
00:34:03 I'm never going to do a Girl in the Gone video, because you did the perfect...
00:34:06 I mean, I already have one where I compared it to Kill Out Kill, but...
00:34:09 I don't think anyone else could do one without at least acknowledging the king in the room.
00:34:13 Who could follow that up? Nobody.
00:34:15 I did my one where I compared it to Kill Out Kill, which is a great video on its own,
00:34:20 but I would never try to do a full-on analysis, because you covered everything.
00:34:24 And when you said you were going to do Ghost in the Shell standalone complex, I was like, cool.
00:34:28 I don't have to go in depth on that show, because he's going to do it,
00:34:31 and I could go do something that you will never do.
00:34:34 Yeah, please.
00:34:36 I guess when it comes to, like, things that you want to see exist.
00:34:43 Because, like, I don't know.
00:34:46 I don't know what I'm saying.
00:34:48 Well, I was just going to say that...
00:34:50 I've said this several times before, but when I was making the Girl in the Gone video,
00:34:53 I did watch, like, every video I could find about it,
00:34:56 and found them woefully inadequate.
00:34:58 So I felt, you know, the need to do it.
00:35:00 I mean, I've done it both ways.
00:35:02 Because, you know, I like watching analysis videos all the time.
00:35:06 So, like, inevitably, if a good one exists, then I'm going to see it.
00:35:10 But usually, I have to do a video because I haven't seen a good one.
00:35:14 And if I haven't seen one at all, it's very unlikely I'm going to find one.
00:35:19 Because, like, I follow all the people who I think are doing really great work.
00:35:24 So even if, let's say, I was going to do some show and, like, a bunch of people have reviewed it,
00:35:29 but if it's not anyone I follow, then there's a good chance there's not any good reviews of it.
00:35:34 Or any that I would want to see.
00:35:37 So, like, yeah, it's not like I'm going to cancel my video just because a lot of people covered it.
00:35:43 It has to be someone good.
00:35:45 I have notes for my Japanese anime, Girl in the Gone.
00:35:49 And all the notes say, it just says, Gundam Lagann.
00:35:54 Nice.
00:35:57 And then under that, it says, fuck it.
00:36:00 And that's the whole...
00:36:01 You should release it as that.
00:36:03 So, apparently, between the first joke and then Nate made his video.
00:36:07 Now, let me tell you, you were on to gold with that first line.
00:36:11 You should follow that and see where it logically leaked.
00:36:13 Did you already do Attack on Gundam?
00:36:15 Yeah, he did.
00:36:16 How did you not watch Girl in the Gone in, like, ten years?
00:36:19 It's been, like, ten years.
00:36:20 Every show about big dudes just eat Gundam Axe.
00:36:22 It was going to be, like, a running joke that everything is Gundam for my Japanese anime.
00:36:26 Which is great.
00:36:27 I like that joke.
00:36:28 But I hardly ever make them anymore, so it's taking a while.
00:36:31 Especially because, like, I can't tell if you...
00:36:33 I should just make the whole video.
00:36:34 It should just be Gundam Lagann, fuck it, at the end.
00:36:36 Yeah.
00:36:37 My favorite thing about that joke is that I'm not sure if you've ever seen any Gundam before.
00:36:41 I've never seen Gundam.
00:36:42 Any of them.
00:36:43 Perfect.
00:36:44 Even better.
00:36:45 No, I saw a little bit of Gundam.
00:36:46 And I never will, because if I do it, I'll ruin the joke.
00:36:49 Yeah, you don't want to know.
00:36:50 Yeah, no, you don't need to.
00:36:51 Like, I don't see you ever trying to wrap your head around Gundam.
00:36:55 It's a bit much.
00:36:56 Does Gundam stand for something?
00:36:57 Is there meaning in that word?
00:36:59 Uh, I think the Gundam is made of Gundaneum.
00:37:01 It's just got a damn gun on it.
00:37:03 Oh, it's named after Gundaneum.
00:37:04 Okay.
00:37:05 Yeah.
00:37:06 Of course, of course.
00:37:07 I believe that's the case.
00:37:08 It's when you see the gun, they go, damn.
00:37:10 Damn.
00:37:11 Gundam.
00:37:12 It's a gun.
00:37:13 It's a gun on a den.
00:37:14 They shoot the den.
00:37:15 The damn gun.
00:37:16 The damn gun.
00:37:17 None of us are going to get that, because I don't watch weeb shit.
00:37:22 Uh, so, I mean, so, like, what we're saying is, I think, like, the whole point of this
00:37:27 was, like, content is, there's all these obstacles.
00:37:31 You gotta pick your shit.
00:37:32 Yeah, the point is, we are doing our best just to wait.
00:37:37 Yeah.
00:37:38 Videos are coming, guys.
00:37:39 Well, I think this is something everybody can relate to who's done creative work.
00:37:43 Yeah.
00:37:44 We all procrastinate.
00:37:45 Or even not creative.
00:37:46 Just, like, you gotta do your homework, and it's like, fuck it.
00:37:48 I don't want to do that shit.
00:37:49 That's happening to me, like, just last week.
00:37:51 I'm taking this class forever.
00:37:52 I never did my homework.
00:37:53 Me neither, dude.
00:37:54 Actually, that was the worst period of my life.
00:37:57 Like, procrastination was really the cause of my, well, I don't know if it was the cause,
00:38:02 but it was like, what was perpetuating my depression back when I was in high school?
00:38:06 That's interesting about that, though, because procrastination really does just, like, okay,
00:38:10 what is procrastination at the end of the day?
00:38:12 You have goals that you want to accomplish.
00:38:14 If you just don't do them, that's procrastination, really.
00:38:17 So, like, yeah, if you aren't doing in your life what you want, then, yeah, you're gonna
00:38:21 be depressed.
00:38:22 Well, what drove me nuts back in high school was that, because I would fall into this loop,
00:38:25 and I'm sure a lot of people are gonna be like, oh, my God, you're making me cry because
00:38:29 this is my life.
00:38:30 Yeah.
00:38:31 So, back in high school, you know, I'd get a lot of homework, and then I'd come home,
00:38:36 and I would have that feeling like the homework is the only thing I should be doing.
00:38:41 Yeah, yeah.
00:38:42 But I wouldn't want to do it.
00:38:43 But as a result, I wouldn't do anything else, because I felt like I should be doing my homework.
00:38:48 Oh, shit.
00:38:49 But I wouldn't do the homework.
00:38:51 So, every night, I'd come home, and I'd just sit on Instant Messenger talking to my friend
00:38:56 on who was a Hikikomori at the time, like, full-blown, like, as in not in school, not
00:39:01 in anything, just in his room, pissing in bottles.
00:39:04 Has he seen NHK by any chance?
00:39:06 Oh, yeah.
00:39:07 We bonded over NHK when we first met.
00:39:09 That's sort of how we became friends was by talking about that show, because he was a
00:39:14 full-blown Hikikomori, and I was a borderline one.
00:39:16 I was still in school, but he had to drop out because he had a medical ailment where
00:39:21 he got headaches that were, like, insanely intense every morning.
00:39:25 Yeah.
00:39:26 That sucks.
00:39:27 So, we would sit there on Messenger, and I would just tell him, like, you know, I wouldn't
00:39:31 watch any anime because, like, because to me, I've always regarded watching anime as,
00:39:36 like, a goal.
00:39:37 Like, that is accomplishing something to me, because it's always been, like...
00:39:40 It's better than doing nothing.
00:39:41 It's better than just jacking off or something.
00:39:42 Right.
00:39:43 Well, I've always been writing an anime blog, and, you know, even back before it was my
00:39:46 job, I was very passionate about doing it.
00:39:48 So to me, watching an anime was always a part of doing my job and, or getting things done,
00:39:56 but I wouldn't do it because I'm like, well, I can't really watch anything because I should
00:39:59 be doing my homework, and I just sit there all day and do nothing and just be super depressed
00:40:03 and fucking want to kill myself by the end of the day.
00:40:06 That's a very familiar feeling, and I think every person here can probably relate to it.
00:40:10 I resent the idea that watching anime is better than jacking off.
00:40:14 Oh, a lot of the times it's the same activity.
00:40:17 Sure, you do have something physical to show for it at the end of jacking off.
00:40:20 I'll give you that much.
00:40:21 Yeah.
00:40:22 Talking about jizz, people.
00:40:25 Talking about jizz.
00:40:26 Don't even get me started on jacking off as a method of procrastination.
00:40:29 Yeah, it's...
00:40:30 I actually, I think I jack off more to procrastinate than to actually satiate my human needs.
00:40:35 Well, I'd say jack off once a day is probably, like, the maximum you need to do to get yourself.
00:40:40 Oh, man.
00:40:41 I...
00:40:42 All right.
00:40:43 I'm just saying need.
00:40:44 I'm saying need.
00:40:45 Okay, yeah.
00:40:46 There is no maximum.
00:40:48 Let's stop that kind of thought right now.
00:40:50 I'm saying to satiate your needs.
00:40:51 I actually think there is, like, I mean, there's obviously a physical capability maximum where
00:40:56 you jerk off so many times you can't anymore.
00:40:58 But I've actually had that moment in the song Long View by Green Day where he says, like,
00:41:03 when masturbation's lost its fun, you're fucking lonely.
00:41:06 And I've had that moment where I jacked off so many times that it just wasn't actually fun anymore.
00:41:12 And I was like, I'm done.
00:41:14 Like, this is the most bored I've ever been in my life.
00:41:17 I mean, you've got issues of chafing to deal with as well, and you know, there's all kinds of shit.
00:41:22 If you're going to go long, you've got to prepare.
00:41:23 Well, it's just like, when you go, like, two days in a row and all you really did was jack off all day,
00:41:28 that's when it gets to that point where you're like, what is my life?
00:41:31 What am I doing?
00:41:32 See, I haven't actually done that yet.
00:41:34 I don't jack off all that much.
00:41:36 Hey, no more procrastinating.
00:41:37 I procrastinate on my jacking off.
00:41:39 I have made by working on a goal before.
00:41:42 I've had several times where I've tried to hit the 12 in one day.
00:41:45 Oh, okay.
00:41:46 I procrastinate jacking off by joining a church.
00:41:48 You know what?
00:41:49 I think jacking off might be the only activity that I do just for fun, not trying to make something out of it.
00:41:58 Yeah, okay.
00:41:59 It's pretty often the one I jump to.
00:42:02 And well, because there's a line in there.
00:42:04 Because everything else, like, I can't do anything unless in my brain, I'm telling myself that it's for a video.
00:42:10 If I want to sit down and play a video game, I have to tell myself, well, I'm going to do a let's play,
00:42:15 or I'm collecting notes for a review.
00:42:17 Oh, shit.
00:42:18 Text just pledged the best guy ever, five bucks.
00:42:19 Thank you, text.
00:42:20 That's how it is for me too, Jess.
00:42:21 And it was a true revelation when I managed to play the Souls games and not feel that way.
00:42:25 And it was only because DeVoo was doing so much work for me that I felt like I had time.
00:42:30 And I was able to just sit down and enjoy all three of them.
00:42:33 And then, of course, I had a bunch of ideas for videos anyway.
00:42:36 So I was like, no, I got to make the most out of the three weeks that I spent playing video games
00:42:40 because it's a healthy process, I think.
00:42:41 Yeah.
00:42:42 I mean, it's a lot better than if I hadn't played them at all and was sitting around for three weeks.
00:42:46 But even Jersey Office has become...
00:42:48 Unless you're no longer some asshole who says it's his favorite game and hasn't even beaten it.
00:42:51 Right.
00:42:52 Even Jacking Office has sometimes become a thing that I did to try to accomplish a goal.
00:42:58 Because in The Venture Brothers, there's an episode where there's this group called The Sphinx,
00:43:03 and Brock Samson was a part of it.
00:43:05 And they're all like...
00:43:07 The guy is like...
00:43:08 The leader of the group's like, we don't keep any secrets here.
00:43:10 Men sound of them.
00:43:11 They're all like saying things that they did that are like secretive.
00:43:13 And Brock Samson goes, I once jacked off 12 times in one day just to see if I could.
00:43:18 And I was like, 12 times, huh?
00:43:20 It's pretty hard.
00:43:21 That sounds pretty rough.
00:43:22 Never have actually made it.
00:43:24 It's a lot harder than it sounds.
00:43:26 It's probably above most human's capability, really.
00:43:28 I think I made it to 10 months.
00:43:30 Do you have to take like a five minute break in between?
00:43:32 You can take whatever breaks you want.
00:43:34 If you came, that's what I would count.
00:43:38 This is why everyone should play Starless.
00:43:42 Yeah, this is very related.
00:43:44 Go play Starless.
00:43:46 I don't think I could jack off to that game.
00:43:49 You never know until you try, my friend.
00:43:51 Well, yeah, okay.
00:43:52 Well, I guess if I was actually trying, I could probably do it.
00:43:55 I mean, some of the scenes are very pleasant, you know?
00:43:57 That was kind of my prize for putting up with all the food.
00:44:01 Now I've just got in my head the idea of playing games while jacking off
00:44:04 like as a skill thing.
00:44:05 Like a speed runner would jack off while playing.
00:44:07 That's why they made Bayonetta playable with only one hand.
00:44:10 You can just play that game.
00:44:11 Better yet, Dead or Alive 2.
00:44:13 I've been there.
00:44:14 You can play Dead or Alive 2 entirely.
00:44:17 Well, the problem is you can only do that with the right hand.
00:44:20 You can only play it one-handed with the right hand.
00:44:22 Luckily for me, I'm left-handed.
00:44:24 It's more of a you did it to say you did it thing
00:44:27 than it is an actual, like, I'm going to do this as a regular activity thing.
00:44:31 What I meant, though, was like, you know those speed runners and those live streams?
00:44:36 Yeah.
00:44:37 I bet anything Lobos could beat Dark Souls while jacking off.
00:44:41 I would bet anything on that.
00:44:43 Can you do it with only one-half and eight-press?
00:44:47 Have you ever heard of Lobos, either of you?
00:44:49 Yeah, I've heard of him.
00:44:50 He's like a famous speed runner guy.
00:44:51 He's the guy who does challenge runs of Dark Souls.
00:44:54 And he's done, like, every retarded, insane, like, you know, level one, no items, no weapons,
00:45:02 fighting the final boss on level eight plus seven.
00:45:04 I think I might have seen his YouTube channel if he has one.
00:45:07 Yeah, he's...
00:45:08 Because I saw him do, like, a run where he was level one and he had that, the, you know,
00:45:14 the chest helmet thing that drains your health slowly.
00:45:17 And he played the entire game like that with no weapons.
00:45:20 Yeah, he will do any retarded challenge you can come up with.
00:45:23 Because I'm pretty sure, I mean, when I thought about it, it makes sense because I'm sure he gets,
00:45:28 he's a sponsored Twitch player, so he's getting paid to just be on Twitch.
00:45:34 So it really doesn't matter how much time he wastes fucking around in a game.
00:45:38 Like, yeah.
00:45:39 Because some of those runs, like, you'll see the final, like, you'll see the video on YouTube
00:45:43 where he beat it, and that'll be a 45-minute video.
00:45:46 And then you're just thinking, think of all the times he died with one hit left.
00:45:49 So many.
00:45:50 And how many days this must have taken.
00:45:52 But if he gets paid just to play the game, then it really, it doesn't matter.
00:45:58 He can play it all day and it's his job.
00:46:01 That's true.
00:46:02 What's up with...
00:46:03 If you were a professional streamer, you know, like, I get the feeling that, like, streaming won't last forever.
00:46:09 And what...
00:46:10 I mean, how much money do these people make?
00:46:12 Are they making enough to, like, save for the future?
00:46:14 I really don't know.
00:46:15 Are they hoping to, like, transition to something else?
00:46:17 Or maybe streaming will just last forever, and I'm just being a Debbie Downer.
00:46:20 Let me ask you guys, have any of you ever watched the YouTube channel Crazy Russian Hacker?
00:46:25 Once or twice, yeah.
00:46:27 So Crazy Russian Hacker is a guy who does these really terrible life hack videos.
00:46:32 Yeah.
00:46:33 And he's, like, this Russian dude, his motto is,
00:46:38 safety is my number one priority.
00:46:40 Right.
00:46:41 He's, like, partly it's the accent and partly he's, like, borderline retarded.
00:46:47 Oh, that's not true.
00:46:48 He's a football.
00:46:49 He's definitely an idiot.
00:46:51 There's videos that reveal that he's probably an idiot.
00:46:55 Okay, well, I haven't done the research, so maybe...
00:46:57 He also made a whole video about how the proper way to eat a, quote, muffin, and it was a fucking cupcake.
00:47:02 Wait, who are we talking about?
00:47:03 He's Russian.
00:47:04 Maybe it's a language barrier.
00:47:05 Crazy Russian Hacker.
00:47:06 Anyway, this guy makes these terrible life hack videos, and they're all stolen.
00:47:09 It's all ideas from around the internet.
00:47:10 He puts out a video every fucking day.
00:47:12 He just finds a life hack.
00:47:14 Is it someone's intellectual property, though, to, like, have a method of how to do it?
00:47:18 Not really, but it's, I mean...
00:47:19 I'd like him to get credit, though, I guess.
00:47:20 All right, here's the thing.
00:47:21 Look.
00:47:22 Yeah.
00:47:23 I don't think he gives credit.
00:47:24 He just makes life hack videos.
00:47:25 It's just obvious that he got them from other places.
00:47:27 I mean, and who the fuck can come up with a life hack every day?
00:47:30 Most of them are stupid and repetitive and dumb, right?
00:47:33 Well, my friends have been watching him, like, ironically, for years.
00:47:37 They, like, they'll make, like, they'll just send each other his videos as a joke and stuff like that.
00:47:41 Sure.
00:47:42 Because it's so stupid.
00:47:43 Well, the thing is, he's huge now.
00:47:44 Dude has five million subscribers, almost, right?
00:47:47 Yeah.
00:47:48 Puts out a video every single day, and all of them have half a million views.
00:47:53 Now, recently, apparently, you know, my brother Victor's been watching him for years, and he
00:47:58 was, like, originally, he was doing these in his mom's kitchen at her house, right?
00:48:03 Well, he'll have this intro where you see him going into a house, and Victor's, like,
00:48:07 it's this really nice house in the mountains, and what I gradually realized is that that's
00:48:12 his house.
00:48:13 He has bought a really nice house in the mountains on the back of this YouTube money,
00:48:18 and I was, like, I was, like, show me his channel.
00:48:20 How much is it?
00:48:21 Let me try to figure out how much he's making.
00:48:22 Now, I know that a thousand views is about a dollar.
00:48:25 Yeah.
00:48:26 Five hundred thousand views is about five hundred dollars, and he puts out a video almost every
00:48:31 day, meaning he makes almost five hundred dollars a day on ad revenue, and he's bought
00:48:37 himself a house in the mountains with that money, from which he does life hack videos
00:48:43 that probably cost ten dollars to make in his kitchen, and I thought, what are we all doing
00:48:49 with our lives?
00:48:50 Really?
00:48:51 That's the...
00:48:52 Being stupid.
00:48:53 Yeah.
00:48:54 I mean, we can't all be that guy.
00:48:55 We can't, like, emulate him and hope to achieve that kind of success.
00:48:58 Those sorts of things just happen.
00:48:59 But, I mean, I have no problem with him profiting off such a thing.
00:49:03 I just wonder, you know, how far is it going to go?
00:49:06 It just makes me wonder, what are we thinking when we're putting so much into these videos?
00:49:13 Right.
00:49:14 Yeah.
00:49:15 Totally.
00:49:16 And, like, all we really need to do is, every single day, look up something on the internet
00:49:20 that sounds like it would make a good video, spend ten dollars at Walmart buying water balloons,
00:49:25 and then, like, explaining how a water balloon can be used as a tampon or something.
00:49:30 That's all you have to do.
00:49:31 I'll tell you what it is.
00:49:33 It's entirely ego.
00:49:34 I make the kind of videos that I make because I see myself as a smart guy, and I'm like,
00:49:40 of course I'm not going to make shitty videos.
00:49:42 I'm going to make the fucking best thing in the world, and I am directly financially hurt
00:49:46 by making that decision.
00:49:47 Well, the sad thing is that, like, I've had a lot of times where I've sat there and gone,
00:49:50 like, it would be so easy to open up an alternate channel and just not associate it with my identity,
00:49:56 or even if I don't even care, fuck, associate it with my identity, use it to promote me,
00:50:00 and I could easily be cranking out videos all the time that were just, like, cheap,
00:50:05 but it's, like, knowing that it would take away from the time I spend on my main content,
00:50:09 or that it could eventually, because, like, you know, because we've all seen what happened
00:50:13 with Game Grumps, where it was like, they didn't think it would take away from it,
00:50:17 but then once it was the main revenue stream, then it was like, well, we might as well
00:50:21 spend more time on Game Grumps, because it makes a lot more money.
00:50:24 Why the fuck wouldn't we, you know?
00:50:26 And so, like, there's always that fear.
00:50:28 But then at the same time, I would totally love to have Game Grumps positioned.
00:50:32 I'd love to have some easy fucking job that prints money, and I could just do,
00:50:36 I could take my sweet time on the passion projects, you know?
00:50:39 I shit on Game Grumps a lot, especially to you guys, because I think it's lazy
00:50:43 and not particularly valuable, and, you know, we've all got our different feelings about it,
00:50:46 but, yeah, there's no doubt that...
00:50:49 I mean, you've kind of taken the...
00:50:51 You're basically doing that because you have a real job,
00:50:54 so you're basically doing another job, you know?
00:50:57 I like to think that my life choices were made based on this core belief
00:51:01 that I have then, you know, extrapolated into how I live my life.
00:51:04 So, it's not like I decided that, then decided the Game Grumps were shit, or whatever.
00:51:08 Yeah, but I just mean that, like, if I could turn YouTube into a job,
00:51:15 because it is my job, you know, but I don't handle it like a job,
00:51:19 I handle it like art, and there's times where those conflict with each other
00:51:23 where, like, I can't make a video that would take a month to make
00:51:27 because I just won't make enough money, you know, it can't happen.
00:51:30 I mean, how you told me right after I released my GERD Live video,
00:51:33 like, you wish you could make a video that would one-up it,
00:51:35 but, you know, it would take four or five months to do, so it's not even worth it.
00:51:38 Ben, my problem, my whole career, is the videos, the kind of stuff that I'm interested in making,
00:51:43 I know it's not the kind of stuff that is successful.
00:51:46 Yeah, and you have to ask yourself, like, is that wise?
00:51:50 Like, are we just being stupid by making these kind of decisions?
00:51:53 Even if it weren't successful, it would just...
00:51:55 The most important thing that I'm looking at right now is I've decided to make a whole concept album
00:52:01 about my friend Pete for no reason, and that's more...
00:52:04 That's not gonna make a lot of money.
00:52:06 No, no one's gonna get it, people are gonna think it's retarded,
00:52:09 but it's way more important to me, artistically, than anything else that I could be doing right now.
00:52:14 And that's exactly why I don't make a lot of music, because, like,
00:52:18 if I wanted to really, like, sit there and just polish an album,
00:52:22 and I mean, I make music really fast when I do it,
00:52:25 so even if I just set aside a week, I could probably make a pretty decent rap album,
00:52:31 but I had to set aside a week, you know, and I can't necessarily do that.
00:52:36 And, you know, that's why I was saying earlier about, like, YMS,
00:52:39 that I kind of envy getting into a cycle where, you know,
00:52:43 people are paying you enough that you can make one video a month and make it perfect, you know, and...
00:52:48 Yeah, that's the dream.
00:52:49 Well, I'm very envious of these guys, like, I kind of look down on them in sort of a snobbish way,
00:52:54 but I'm also envious...
00:52:55 Who have YMS or the...
00:52:56 ...of guys who you watch their channels,
00:52:59 and it seems like they're only interested in making one specific genre of video or one kind of contract,
00:53:04 because that's good for them, because that's what works.
00:53:07 People like consistency.
00:53:08 Yeah.
00:53:09 But I can't help but look at it sort of snobbishly, like,
00:53:13 how can you call yourself an artist when you're just making the same shit over and over again?
00:53:18 That, I think, is overly simplifying.
00:53:22 Like, you're like always studying in Philadelphia, right?
00:53:27 Like, that's the same formula.
00:53:28 Yeah.
00:53:29 It's not, like, the highest art, obviously,
00:53:32 but I don't think it's fair to just say that, out of hand, it's a lower form.
00:53:35 Well, I'm saying I'm envious of it, because I kind of wish that I had that,
00:53:39 because I can't do things that way.
00:53:41 I'm incapable of focusing on one thing.
00:53:44 I've told a friend of the show, Mother's Basement, who we had on a few weeks ago,
00:53:49 like, that I'm...
00:53:50 Because he...
00:53:51 I'm envious of him because he likes everything to be a series.
00:53:55 Yeah.
00:53:56 Like, he does what's in an OP, now he's doing, like, he's doing a bunch of different types of analysis,
00:54:01 but they're all a series.
00:54:02 What's in a scene?
00:54:03 What's in a level?
00:54:04 What's in an OP?
00:54:05 You know, like, and he wants it all to be these ongoing things.
00:54:08 And I'm like, man, if I could do that, it would be so much...
00:54:11 It would make my life so much easier to know, at the end of every week,
00:54:15 that I can, you know, that the same video will come out.
00:54:18 And it's like, I just...
00:54:19 There's never been a concept that I wanted to do for that long.
00:54:23 And I tried, at the end of last year, I've told you guys about this.
00:54:27 I don't know if I've mentioned it on the podcast,
00:54:29 but at the end of last year, I tried to come up with a plan, like a syllabus,
00:54:33 to have one video come out every week, all year, for 2016.
00:54:39 And I had eight different series, which would come out bi-week, bi-monthly, rather.
00:54:44 And so it would be like, you know, you'd get four series one month, four series the next month,
00:54:49 and then you get each series again.
00:54:51 So each one would only have, like, four videos for that series coming out, or, no, six.
00:54:56 Six videos per series each year.
00:54:58 But it would be eight different series.
00:55:00 But, like, even within that structure of those, I kept boiling it down to, like,
00:55:04 well, I don't really want to do this one, or, like, I don't have enough ideas for this one to last.
00:55:08 So in the end, I was only left with, like, three that I still kind of want to do.
00:55:12 And even then, just a prospect of making something, and then knowing that in two months,
00:55:17 I'm beholden to make the same thing, is, like, too much for me.
00:55:21 Because, like, what if two months from now, I want to do something else,
00:55:24 but I have to make this fucking series, you know?
00:55:27 Yeah, put yourself in that position.
00:55:29 Do you have to have, like, a series with a time release schedule?
00:55:32 Uh, I guess not.
00:55:34 But, like, the concept at the time was that I was going to try to write all 52 videos before the year started.
00:55:40 Like, just write them all at once.
00:55:42 And I wrote, like, four of them, and then just kind of gave up, but, yeah.
00:55:46 I'm kind of actually trying to do that as well.
00:55:48 I want to write a bunch so that I can have one come out every month.
00:55:52 For guys like us, Kim, who have a harder time writing, that's probably a wise way to go.
00:55:58 Yeah.
00:55:59 Writing is hard, and I hate it.
00:56:01 Writing's easy for me.
00:56:03 Editing's hard.
00:56:04 And for me, the hardest thing is caring for a long time.
00:56:08 Like, the reason my videos get done so fast is because as soon as I'm done writing it,
00:56:13 I don't care about it anymore, so, like, it stops being interesting.
00:56:16 Like, those videos that I did write for last year, um, you know, I have them all,
00:56:20 and they're still good scripts.
00:56:22 But the idea of trying to make videos out of them now,
00:56:25 now that I'm, like, not that hype about it anymore, is, like, really difficult,
00:56:29 where I've got, like, a few that, um, like, one of them was the Top 10 Directing Tricks in Avangelion,
00:56:35 which is a great script, and people really want me to do another Avavid,
00:56:39 but, like, I put it in the editing bay, and I was just like,
00:56:44 Why did I write this months ago and not, I should've just edited it immediately as soon as it was done, you know?
00:56:50 As soon as I wrote it, back when I was still impressed with myself that I had written it, you know?
00:56:55 I have had times where I caught a second wind where I read an old script and, like, forgot how good it was
00:57:00 and wanted to make it a video again.
00:57:02 That is nice, but, yeah, it's good to capitalize on your creative spark when it hits as best you can.
00:57:10 I never have, like, ideas for scripts.
00:57:12 I always just go into thinking, like, I want to talk about this because I know I like it, but why?
00:57:18 Yeah, that's interesting.
00:57:20 It's sometimes really difficult to understand why, because I'm not very good at analyzing, like, myself and games and stuff,
00:57:28 but I just, I don't know, it's fun to talk about, so I still do it.
00:57:33 Well, I need to write a video for this.
00:57:35 What happens is that, like, I'll be, I'll just get something in my head and then I'll go, I gotta go and write this down before I forget it.
00:57:42 Then I'll write it, and then as I write it, more just pours out, and it goes, like, really easily.
00:57:48 And before I know it, oh, great, I have another entire fucking video I have to make.
00:57:52 Yeah.
00:57:53 For me, it's always having the, sort of, the first sentence, like, there's two ways that the videos come about.
00:58:02 Yeah, well, yeah, like, for that one, for instance, it was that I was bothered that the discussion on what is anime and what isn't was always being had,
00:58:10 and then I thought, like, here's how I would approach the argument, and then once I've thought about that, I always construct the first sentence,
00:58:17 and then I go from there.
00:58:19 So, like, yeah, with the anime as a Japanese colloquialism, like, that line was stewing in my head for days.
00:58:25 That's just a meme now, that's a hilarious line to me.
00:58:27 Yeah.
00:58:29 And it's often times that what'll happen is, I'll get the phrase, and then I'll go take a shower, and then while I'm in the shower,
00:58:35 I'll spend the entire shower just constructing the first sentence, or the first paragraph.
00:58:39 Oh man, I do that too, but I'm always scared that I'm gonna forget things before I get out of the shower.
00:58:43 It's anywhere where there's, like, no internet or no distractions.
00:58:47 You know where my sanctum of inspiration is?
00:58:51 Toilet, it's the toilet, right?
00:58:52 No, no, it's Walmart.
00:58:54 Cause, like, that's a good one.
00:58:56 Walmart is, like, where I go, like, it's usually, like, four in the morning when I go there.
00:59:01 No one's there.
00:59:02 Cause you have one in walking distance.
00:59:03 Yeah, and whenever I'm there, I'm just kind of an autopilot walking around.
00:59:07 And when I'm in Walmart, like, I'll wander around Walmart aimlessly for, like, 30 minutes, or 30 minutes to an hour,
00:59:14 not by anything, but then I'll have, like, 10 entire videos in my fucking head, and I gotta go home and write all of them.
00:59:21 I have a road next to my house that's, like, a mile long, and I'll walk down it almost every night and have a cigarette,
00:59:28 and, like, and that's where I usually try to come up with concepts.
00:59:31 But what happens is, if I don't have an idea for a video, then all I think about is, like, stuff about my life,
00:59:37 or, like, drama, or something I've been into, or something, like...
00:59:40 Yeah, yeah.
00:59:41 Like, a lot of the times it's just me thinking about how pissed off I am at somebody on the internet,
00:59:46 and, like, running through all the social reasons that I would be mad and, like, what it says about society as a whole,
00:59:51 and just getting so, like, angry.
00:59:53 And that's the kind of stuff that becomes...
00:59:54 You should, hey, everyone's making beef videos these days. Let's capitalize on that now.
00:59:58 Well, all of that stuff becomes Digi Bro's discussions, you know, like...
01:00:01 Yeah, yeah, that's inappropriate.
01:00:02 Anything I think about that can't be made into, like, a good video just becomes a Digi Bro's discussion.
01:00:07 But, like, when I'm in the middle of writing, then I'll often go for a walk to figure out what the next paragraph is gonna be.
01:00:14 The one that I did that the most with was the PsychoPass videos,
01:00:17 because there's, like, there's parts in there where I just drop, like, all these heavy concepts in a row,
01:00:21 and it was just, like, I write a paragraph and then go outside and walk around, have a cigarette, come back in,
01:00:26 just, like, keep walking around my house and doing laps and shit, like, trying to think of the next sentence.
01:00:32 That was the most, like, I ever felt, like, a writer, you know, like...
01:00:35 Yeah, yeah.
01:00:36 Because it comes so naturally to me that a lot of the times it's just I sit down and I pump something out,
01:00:40 and I'm like, well, okay, but then, like, that was the one script where it was, like,
01:00:44 I really had to struggle to think of how I'm gonna put this idea to words,
01:00:48 and it was the biggest come in the universe to actually do it.
01:00:53 Whoa, you said you sit down and you pump something out, and it was the biggest come in the universe.
01:00:57 Yeah.
01:00:58 Awesome.
01:00:59 Yeah, it's the PsychoPass and the Kaon videos.
01:01:01 Those were the ones that I had, like, the most, like, like, revelations when writing it,
01:01:06 where it was like, how do I put this?
01:01:08 And then I'd come up with the perfect phrase and be like, oh, my God, I finally did it.
01:01:12 I can finally explain what's so good about Kaon, you know?
01:01:15 Like, with Kaon, it was the phrase I kept saying throughout the whole video.
01:01:18 I kept saying, the more you watch of it, the more you like it,
01:01:21 and I said it so many times because it was such a revelation to me at the time that I was writing
01:01:25 that that was, like, totally how I felt about it.
01:01:28 I get so self-conscious of, like, my big lines whenever I'm going over a script,
01:01:33 especially after I've recorded it, and it's like, oh, God, I hope people don't hate me for overselling it.
01:01:39 Yeah, yeah.
01:01:41 There's a few lines in the Astroscore series where I either, like, if I think it's a corny line,
01:01:49 then I oversell it on purpose to show that I acknowledge that it's a corny line,
01:01:53 and then if I think it's really cool, then I just, you know, play it straight and...
01:01:57 Yeah.
01:01:58 Like, the lines that you did in part nine were definitely good,
01:02:01 but just, like, as a guy who makes kind of dramatic videos sometimes like that,
01:02:06 I just, I pictured myself doing that, and I was, like, projecting myself.
01:02:10 I was like, oh, I hope people don't think this is great.
01:02:12 But it wasn't at all. It was deserving.
01:02:14 Oh, apparently it was haunting and deep, and I got so...
01:02:19 Yeah, that was good.
01:02:20 I got, like, a few hundred comments about how...
01:02:23 Those marks.
01:02:24 I got, like, a few hundred comments about how that was my best video ever,
01:02:27 and it made them so emotional, and it was so depressing, which is great,
01:02:30 because that's exactly the intention.
01:02:32 I told DeVue, I was like, part nine has to depress people,
01:02:35 and I actually redid all the audio on it,
01:02:37 because the original one I did was more in line with the rest of the series,
01:02:41 and I was like, it has to be, like, really sobering and dark
01:02:45 and make you feel like shit afterwards,
01:02:47 and a lot of comments said that that happened, so I'm glad.
01:02:50 A lot of them, specifically because they were eating McDonald's when they watched it,
01:02:55 I got, like, ten comments to the effect of I was...
01:02:58 Or I ate McDonald's just before watching this, and now I feel really self-conscious,
01:03:01 and I was like, perfect.
01:03:02 I bet there were quite a few Monocles dropped at that moment.
01:03:04 Yeah, and then I had to point out to those people, like,
01:03:06 I ate McDonald's in the video.
01:03:09 You know, I wrote this video, and then I had to go buy and eat McDonald's,
01:03:13 and, like, and do that for the video, you know.
01:03:17 I felt just as bad as anybody.
01:03:19 Yeah, man, it's funny, it's just that that exact sort of thing
01:03:22 is really what I plan on doing with my...
01:03:24 And I've already got footage for it to do, like, a bunch of shit like that,
01:03:27 so it was probably my favorite moment of anything you've done in your entire filmography.
01:03:32 The live-action segment.
01:03:33 Yeah, just to, you know, make a...
01:03:35 You know, you've seen a million Digi videos.
01:03:37 He makes this change.
01:03:38 It's this related thing, the speech, the music.
01:03:41 It was just, yeah, good stuff.
01:03:43 Fun fact about that, it was totally half-assed and last minute.
01:03:47 That's great, that's great.
01:03:48 Because it was like, Javu went,
01:03:49 I don't have any ideas for this segment.
01:03:51 You should do a live-action segment, and I said,
01:03:53 okay, then I got Victor, and like...
01:03:55 Because Victor hates doing live-action for me,
01:03:57 but I was like, dude, this is the Astroscore,
01:03:59 it's my best video series, we have to nail it, you know.
01:04:03 And he just took a bunch of random shots of me.
01:04:05 Also, you're probably just like, you're going to McDonald's buying food,
01:04:08 so that's what, like, ten minutes, you know.
01:04:10 I was amazed by how many people were like, legitimately impressed with the filmography of that,
01:04:14 because it was not like, it wasn't staged or directed or anything,
01:04:18 it was just like, Victor just pointed a fucking camera at me while I got dressed,
01:04:22 and it just happens to be a fairly nice camera, so the visuals look clean, you know.
01:04:26 I happen to think that my filmography that I did in my, what was it,
01:04:31 like that little update, or the Final Fantasy 7 one where I was filming me driving,
01:04:37 I think that came out great, and that was me nearly killing myself driving in my car.
01:04:42 But my point is that I did actually set up a bunch of stuff,
01:04:46 like I had my DS at home, like paused on the exact screen,
01:04:50 and then I drove out to get footage, and yeah, so it worked out really well.
01:04:55 But it's like, just even doing live action footage when you're guys like us who do a lot of editing,
01:05:00 I'm not saying that makes it look better, but it's, you know, if you do even these, it's going to be...
01:05:05 It's just unexpected, and it shows up cool, and I told Victor like,
01:05:08 the only shot that I really care about is that we see the golden arches coming up in the distance,
01:05:13 which I didn't even end up using, because it didn't come out right,
01:05:16 because I thought it was a much taller sign, but the one that we went to had one of the little signs,
01:05:22 because to me it was so important, because what I'm trying to evoke there is that the reason...
01:05:28 Right, you see the arches and it recognizes you.
01:05:31 Well, to go in deep a little bit, the reason that so many places like that are they all look the same
01:05:36 is because they want it to be the same no matter where you are, where it's sort of atemporal.
01:05:40 Actually, one of the only good idea channel videos of the last two years was the one he did on hotels
01:05:46 and how they kind of exist outside of reality, because it's like you're always going to the same hotel,
01:05:53 like they're all the same place, because they try to be, which would have been an even better video
01:05:57 if he had done it about Walmart or something, because that's explicitly what they try to do.
01:06:03 They want it to be so that no matter what town you're in, you go into Walmart and it's always reliable,
01:06:07 and I've been to a lot of conventions or to concerts in other cities,
01:06:12 and when you do that, you almost always eat at McDonald's or Wendy's, because you recognize it and you know what it is.
01:06:20 There's probably a thousand great local restaurants near you, but you have no idea what they are,
01:06:25 so you're just like, oh McDonald's, yeah, but we didn't even really get that shot.
01:06:30 I really like that you had one shot in mind, because I don't want to spoil things for the future here,
01:06:37 but I've got the one piece video I'm working on, and I too had exactly one image and went out and got it
01:06:43 and then just got all this other shit, so when that comes out, listen back to this,
01:06:47 and this is me telling you how great that's going to be, and it was all from just one image in my head.
01:06:50 And you recorded it like a year ago.
01:06:52 At this point, it's probably been seven months, and the Ghost in the Shell footage has got to be almost a year now,
01:06:57 so it's one of these days.
01:07:00 Every best guy ever video is like the product of like an entire film pre-production cycle.
01:07:07 Pretty much.
01:07:09 I mean, Guru in the Gaon itself...
01:07:11 Guru in the Gaon, the video took four months to make, and Guru in the Gaon...
01:07:15 It took four months to edit, it took months and months before that to write.
01:07:18 But Guru in the Gaon, the TV series, had like, I think four years of pre-production,
01:07:23 and then it was made in like six months.
01:07:26 Because they said...
01:07:28 I remember Imaishi saying they'd spent so long pre-planning it,
01:07:32 and they had like way more ideas that just kind of got left on the cutting room floor.
01:07:37 They originally had done all this research into what an underground society would be like.
01:07:42 I love what they did with that, but they definitely could have done more if they wanted to.
01:07:46 They said that they had done all this research into moles and how they see,
01:07:50 and like what it would be like if people lived underground,
01:07:52 and like they were gonna flesh it out and make it this whole world,
01:07:55 and they were like, eh, they just get through all that.
01:07:58 Yeah, and then like he said that actually making the show was like really fast,
01:08:03 because they had everything planned out, so it's just like they zoomed through it,
01:08:06 and it took no time.
01:08:08 I like that a lot. It's good stuff.
01:08:10 Yeah, it's pretty cool.
01:08:12 I actually just remembered that this is a podcast, and we're recording.
01:08:17 Yeah, we're about at the end of it.
01:08:18 Yeah, I figure we can wrap it up soon.
01:08:20 This is about procrastination.
01:08:22 Well, let's finish it later.
01:08:25 I don't wanna.
01:08:28 Well, date was demanding that we keep these shorter than the last one.
01:08:32 I got an Undertale video to edit, alright?
01:08:35 I think I had time to suck my own dick like the rest of you.
01:08:37 Alright, last time was too long,
01:08:40 but it was also a topic that I was really passionate about,
01:08:43 and I kind of wanted to do that podcast for a long time,
01:08:46 so that's why I wanted to let it run long.
01:08:49 Jesse's list just...
01:08:51 And Jesse had a million things on his list.
01:08:53 And since last week, I watched a video by the Nostalgia Chick.
01:08:59 She actually did every single thing on my list that I hated in one video.
01:09:04 It was honestly inspiring.
01:09:07 Your message needs to be heard.
01:09:09 The people, hopefully they'll...
01:09:11 Oh, by the way, there's something else that I wanted to touch on.
01:09:14 Some wonderful commenter last week
01:09:17 went through the trouble of giving us all individual ratings
01:09:22 for our performance in that podcast.
01:09:24 And you know, he gave everyone else...
01:09:26 You know, did you got like a 9?
01:09:28 He gave me a 2 out of 10.
01:09:30 Really, motherfucker?
01:09:32 I thought he gave you like a negative 2 out of 4.
01:09:35 He gave me a negative 2.
01:09:37 2 out of 10.
01:09:39 Yeah, I was so horrible in that podcast.
01:09:42 I only carried the entire conversation
01:09:45 and made everyone laugh constantly.
01:09:47 You piece of shit.
01:09:48 Oh, the horror that I carried the conversation.
01:09:50 I made everyone laugh constantly.
01:09:52 The horror, the agonizing horror.
01:09:54 I'm so bad.
01:09:55 I'm like power glove bad, right, dipshit?
01:09:57 You piece of shit.
01:09:59 I thought not only that Jesse did the best in that podcast
01:10:03 because he actually had a list,
01:10:05 but also that it was the best he had been in any of the podcasts so far.
01:10:08 Yeah, that's the thing.
01:10:09 It was definitely his best performance thus far in this...
01:10:11 I deserve a 12 out of 10.
01:10:13 And yeah, he had lots of hilarious moments.
01:10:15 I legitimately lost my shit watching the video back at parts.
01:10:20 Anyway, alright, each of us,
01:10:23 let's sign off by saying what we're gonna stop procrastinating
01:10:26 and get back to doing.
01:10:27 Jesse, what are you gonna get back to doing after this podcast?
01:10:31 Finish your Adam's Family retrospective.
01:10:34 Make some bloopers.
01:10:35 Don't spoil it, it's gotta be a secret.
01:10:37 No one can know about it.
01:10:38 We can bloop that out ourselves.
01:10:40 No one can know my secrets, because if they know about it,
01:10:42 then I'll never finish it.
01:10:44 Well, you just gotta finish it before the video comes out.
01:10:46 Before this video comes out.
01:10:47 That's fucking impossible.
01:10:49 Well, did you just editing it?
01:10:50 Who knows how long it'll take?
01:10:52 Like five minutes.
01:10:54 I think I edit a lot faster than you guys.
01:10:56 Cut that out.
01:10:57 That's because I put in an effort.
01:10:58 Take that out of the podcast.
01:10:59 I'm not getting back to doing anything.
01:11:01 I'm gonna be procrastinating forever.
01:11:03 As soon as this podcast is done,
01:11:04 I'm gonna get back to playing Honey Pop
01:11:06 and jerking off forever.
01:11:09 Hi, Hippocrite.
01:11:10 What are you gonna get back to doing?
01:11:13 I'm gonna get back to writing episode,
01:11:16 or not episode two,
01:11:17 but the Ratchet and Clank 2 review,
01:11:19 which I've been working on.
01:11:21 Fun fact, me and Victor just recorded
01:11:24 five episodes of Ratchet and Clank 2.
01:11:27 Let's play.
01:11:28 Oh, shit.
01:11:29 Wait, but seriously,
01:11:30 what's up with that Kingdom Hearts video?
01:11:33 I don't know.
01:11:34 I'm gonna release that later
01:11:36 when I've released an actual video.
01:11:38 Okay, fair enough.
01:11:40 Because of my last few, just been whatever.
01:11:42 Alright, Nate,
01:11:43 what are you gonna get back to doing?
01:11:44 I'm gonna edit the shit out of everyone.
01:11:47 It's...
01:11:48 When is this fucking video gonna be done, Nate?
01:11:51 It's coming, god damn it.
01:11:53 I work hard every day.
01:11:54 How much can possibly be left?
01:11:56 I don't understand.
01:11:57 So hard for my money,
01:11:59 so you better treat me right.
01:12:01 How many hours does it take you
01:12:02 per minute of editing?
01:12:04 I'm curious.
01:12:05 Because this video is like 25 hours to do 30 seconds.
01:12:09 Oh my god, what the fuck were you doing?
01:12:11 I was editing.
01:12:12 I have a vision.
01:12:13 I can't see what was your vision.
01:12:15 This guy was giving me shit.
01:12:17 I was like, oh man,
01:12:18 this is gonna be the best blue glow ever.
01:12:20 He's like, oh what, it's like a 6 out of 10?
01:12:22 This is coming from a guy
01:12:23 who makes like one video every three years.
01:12:25 He's sitting there doing nothing.
01:12:27 Everything the world ever needs or wants.
01:12:29 Bull.
01:12:30 Do they criticize Da Vinci
01:12:31 for taking a while in the Sistine Chapel?
01:12:33 I don't think so.
01:12:34 I crap out a Sistine Chapel every two days.
01:12:39 A poo covered Sistine Chapel.
01:12:41 I actually have to go crap out
01:12:43 a Sistine Chapel for real.
01:12:45 In the toilet.
01:12:47 That wasn't a metaphor for my next video.
01:12:49 I just have to take a shit.
01:12:51 I have nothing planned tonight.
01:12:53 I'm probably gonna,
01:12:55 I honestly have no idea.
01:12:56 I have no idea what I'm gonna do tonight.
01:12:58 So that's it for this episode.
01:13:02 Everybody say goodbye.
01:13:04 Goodbye.
01:13:05 Goodbye.
01:13:07 Fuck you.
01:13:09 We did it.
