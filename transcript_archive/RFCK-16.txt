00:00:00 Routy is the one year anniversary of our fucking video game Endless War, a tech space MMORPG that
00:00:22 you can play in a Discord server.
00:00:38 Today, the 9th of April is the first year since it came online. I believe a year ago and a
00:00:45 couple days was the first time our server went online. I have no idea when the actual
00:00:51 anniversary of that is. I think that's in March actually. I'm going to look at that.
00:00:53 April 9th is the day that the bot went online?
00:00:59 Yeah, the bot went online, yes.
00:01:01 Yeah, okay, so that's in my book, that's the Endless War's birthday.
00:01:05 Also, coincidentally, it's also my birthday. It just became my birthday half an hour ago.
00:01:12 Wait, are you serious?
00:01:13 Yes, April 7th. Yeah, thank you.
00:01:18 I didn't want to tell you, I deliberately hid that information until the show started.
00:01:22 That's so crazy. Oh man, I'm going to have to give you something.
00:01:26 My birthday is two days before that of Endless War, as it happens.
00:01:31 Well, it just still happens.
00:01:32 Yeah.
00:01:33 You're also very close to the first episode or the anniversary of Veryfuckers Cop Killers itself,
00:01:39 because it's on the 11th of April, so April's just a big month. April's a huge fucking month.
00:01:45 It's like, yeah, two days, two days, two days. Also, I just want to say, so I'm here playing
00:01:51 Enter the Gungeon, because I want to hunt that rowdy rat sweetmouth. I hear he's lurking down here,
00:01:58 and I haven't killed him yet, and I'm out for vengeance. He's been the prodigal son for too
00:02:05 long, and it's time to bring him to justice. I know he's down here somewhere, and I haven't
00:02:09 managed to kill him yet, and also I just fucked up, because I shot the water barrel in the fire
00:02:15 place room for it, so yeah, so I'm already behind. I've already screwed up, but you know, whatever.
00:02:22 Okay, okay, viewer. Okay, we're going to premiere this, right?
00:02:26 Yeah, I think so.
00:02:27 Okay, so you're watching this premiere. This is a big event. This is the whole day of
00:02:30 the event that we planned for you, right today. After this video is over, that's not the end of
00:02:36 things. This isn't just like a, oh, cool, like a Veryfuckers Cop Killers episode. I love those.
00:02:40 You know, I can't wait to click, oh, you know, watch right now. No, click the link.
00:02:43 That was that would be taken to an all day stream that we're going to be doing in person.
00:02:47 You may think a premiere is live stream. No, it's not. I don't know how many out. I don't know why
00:02:51 that everyone who watches the premiere doesn't know what the fuck it is. Even still, to be honest,
00:02:56 if you've never done a premiere, if you've never like launched a premiere, I totally get why you
00:03:01 would have no idea what it is. It says premiere. It says premiere on it. That doesn't explain what
00:03:07 a premiere that doesn't explain what a premiere is, though. Well, okay, whatever. We're not live.
00:03:11 We can't see you since Super Chat's still though. Anyway, after this, there'll be a real actual
00:03:16 stream on our Twitch. Well, Pokemon, XT, Gale of Darkness, not to mention. It'll be a bit of a
00:03:23 variety stream. Yeah, yeah. Unless XT just takes us all day. It's going to go from noon to midnight,
00:03:29 Eastern Standard Time. And during that time as well, if you click on our Discord server, the
00:03:34 thing that this whole thing is dedicated to, then you'll be able to play the one of the earliest
00:03:40 versions of Endless War. You'll be able to see what it was like back in the old days. Endless War
00:03:47 Classic will be live, what, today only, right? Today only. Today only. So get in there while the
00:03:52 fucking game's good. Click that fucking Discord link down in the description if you haven't already.
00:03:57 Listen, okay. I know there are some people who watch our FCK and know how to play Endless War.
00:04:02 Not a lot, because frankly, I literally don't understand how that's possible. But if you've
00:04:08 ever thought, like, maybe it may be something to the effect of like, like, it's almost like
00:04:13 like a one piece or a homesick where it's like, it's still, you know, there's so much there,
00:04:17 it'll take too long to catch up in a way. There's so much well-established, like, societal and cultural,
00:04:24 you know, stuff that I'll have to, you know, read or just, you know, listen to or something
00:04:30 intimidated by the vast, deep society that we built for ourselves right now is the time.
00:04:36 Jump in right now, be part of the community, and stop fucking way on the sidelines.
00:04:41 Yeah. Also, I don't even feel like, you know, I think we used to say, I think maybe we used to
00:04:46 say that there was like, just so much. Well, no, I think we, no, we fought this notion. We fought
00:04:51 this notion that there's like so much lore that you like can't, you know, it's impossible to catch
00:04:57 up. You don't need to catch up. You don't need to know everything that's happened. It's not important.
00:05:01 It's all, you know, it's whatever. That's all in the past, and we're looking forward. We're
00:05:06 looking to the future. We are. So just join, you can read orientation, you get caught up in literally
00:05:13 five minutes, and you'll know everything that you need to know. Yeah. Play the fucking game. It's
00:05:17 literally not hard. This is even like a less complicated version of the game than is like,
00:05:21 you know, this is literally just, you press mine and you press kill and you're done.
00:05:25 Temporarily, we're temporarily rolling back that feature creep.
00:05:30 Temporarily. Very, very temporarily. Among the people who haven't played the game are also people
00:05:35 who can't mad when you play the game. And while I don't respect you whatsoever, just so happens
00:05:40 that my interest aligns with yours for a second, because there's just so much to talk about, because
00:05:44 through the last thing in February, in February, that was like a billion years ago.
00:05:48 Was that so like two months ago? Maybe just so much. Yeah. So much to talk about. So,
00:05:55 so we can catch me as much as I would like to. But first, but first, let me crack into,
00:06:00 let me crack into my new, my energy drink of choice. Please, please, God, please, God, summit,
00:06:07 summit gridlock. Oh, Mike. Okay, I'm, I'm fucking rigorously Googling. So just right now. Okay,
00:06:13 summit gridlock. Okay. Oh, somebody's like, yeah, this looks like Metal Gear Solid 3 is what this
00:06:20 looks like. It looks like it's like it looks like a health potion. It looks like Metal Gear Solid
00:06:25 3. This is the most like parkour dude 91 thing I've ever seen in my entire life. Yeah, it is.
00:06:31 It's so parkour. Okay, think of gridlock. It's pretty similar. It's pretty similar to Monster Ultra.
00:06:38 But the thing about it is it's a dollar can for like a full size can. It's, it's, it's only,
00:06:44 it's like only available at Aldi though. So, so get your butts, get your butts to Aldi, I guess.
00:06:50 I'm so glad that we are just like, like rapidly becoming the energy drink duo. I feel like this
00:06:56 is the dynamic that we need to empathize, or emphasize in all of our content together. Because
00:07:02 I, listen, you've heard of bang, but have you heard of rain? I have. From you. But only briefly,
00:07:11 only briefly, and that was a shit flavor. But I am drinking right now rain energy drink,
00:07:17 Melomania. That's, that's um, that's R E I G N. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's R E I G N. Yeah,
00:07:26 yeah, yeah. And I'm about to send you a picture if you can please show it on, on the episode.
00:07:31 I'll just tab over or whatever. All of my, my potions, my various potions that I have today
00:07:36 in front of me. I'm going to be drinking all of these this recording session. I've already cracked
00:07:40 into the Melomania. I'm not, I'm not editing, I'm not editing an image into the video. Okay, well,
00:07:46 okay. Are you recording your, I was just imagining that you would tab over to his court and then
00:07:50 open it. But if you're only recording your game, then whatever, I was supposed to be in the,
00:07:54 okay, yeah, I can do that. But I'm, I'm, I'm killing the, I'm killing the king of,
00:07:58 I'm killing the king of time right now or something. So, well, whatever he's, he, listen,
00:08:03 does he drink bane? Is, is his mental retardation cured? I don't think so. I don't think he matters.
00:08:07 Okay. Show, show me this, show me this, show me this crap.
00:08:10 Right. I deemed it to you. I'm going to be going to taste test. I'm going to be evaluating
00:08:15 energy drink and I'll be telling you how they're rigged.
00:08:17 Okay. So, okay. There is a new monster ultra flavor. It is green. It is slime green.
00:08:26 What? And it is, and it is called ultra paradise.
00:08:32 No. And it is apparently green apple watermelon flavor, which sounds
00:08:36 too good. It sounds too good to be true to me. This is so, you know, you know, Ben, this, this,
00:08:45 this reminds me of a, of a, of a local brand of energy drink from new Los Angeles city,
00:08:50 Akinia, Milwaukee, a fuck energy. I used to drink fuck energy as a kid.
00:08:55 Yeah. Until you need to stop. But you didn't.
00:09:02 Yeah. This, you know, it's like stinky tofu. Like when you eat it, it reminds you of home.
00:09:06 It smells terrible and it tastes terrible, but you know, it just, it just brings it back.
00:09:10 It just brings you back. This reminds me of fucking energy a lot. Anyway, I have right right
00:09:14 here. And as I described to you, Ben, over deems, what a rain con candy was, it was just a watered
00:09:21 down con candy bank. It was just sort of like a, someone saw like tasting bank. I was like,
00:09:26 yeah, I guess we can do that. I guess we can make our own energy drink, but they didn't put
00:09:31 their hearts in the water. However, melon mania, which I'm drinking right now
00:09:37 is fucking de-lish. Have you ever had a hubba-bubba watermelon flavor?
00:09:45 Yes, sir. Yes. It tastes just like that, but it makes you energized and it makes you feel like
00:09:51 you could crush a car between your fucking big toe and your pinky toe. It's absolutely delish.
00:09:58 And rain, I'm giving you a fucking hard, hard eight to light nine. You are doing great,
00:10:06 my friend. You are doing fucking great. Sadly, your con candy flavor sucks. However,
00:10:12 I also have right in front of me the original that rain you cannot stand up to. And that's
00:10:18 con candy bank. So let me taste some of this right now.
00:10:21 Mmm. Rain. Ah, you may taste good, but you're no bang. Bang, bang. That was me shooting rain,
00:10:30 because bang is a fucking literal ten out of ten. This con candy bank is the most delicious
00:10:34 fucking drink I've ever had in my entire fucking life. Nothing can beat it. I have to,
00:10:39 I gotta get me some. I gotta get me some. You've been drooling over the con candy bank
00:10:44 ever since I told you about it. Well, I'm a little skeptical. You know, I'm a little-
00:10:49 Oh, you're skeptical? I wouldn't say skeptical. I would say curious. I'm curious. Like, what
00:10:54 is a cotton candy energy drink? What does that even like? What does it even mean in today's world?
00:11:00 You know, it sounds weird, but the actual taste itself, I don't think is necessarily radical.
00:11:06 The thing about bang is it's, you don't really realize it, but drink, energy drink flavors
00:11:15 are sort of subdued in a way, where it's like, uh, yeah, they do have flavors, and flavors
00:11:21 are usually distinct. Technically, they taste like something. Technically. Yeah. But bang is
00:11:27 like an assault on you. Bang is like the most like, like, it's not that the flavor is better,
00:11:33 it's just that there is more of it. It just is like, they put way too much syrup into it,
00:11:38 and you cannot- That sounds perfect. It sounds like all your sentence.
00:11:40 It sounds like exactly what I want in a beverage. I know, it's- Ben, I'm gonna fucking smuggle you.
00:11:48 I swear to God, I'm gonna smuggle you a melon mania, uh, rain, and I'll smuggle you in a con
00:11:54 candy bang. I have, uh, I have, I have yet to actually, like, check any stores near me. There
00:12:00 could be, there could be bang around here. I just don't know. I'm sleeping on it. I'm sleeping on
00:12:07 that bang. Hey, hold on. Speaking of Boston, next time I'm in Boston. Yeah. Uh, this will be my
00:12:14 first public, uh, announcement of this. Uh, you know Ben, but, uh, the, the, the, the saga that has
00:12:22 plagued me and my appearances on the procrastinators podcast for a while now is over. I got into
00:12:31 Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, I, I, I'm all- Massachusetts awaits.
00:12:37 Matt, yeah, I, so I've been, I'm gonna be able to, like, RCK will turn into, like, possibly
00:12:42 an exclusively in-person ordeal. Scary. Scary though. How fucking weird will that be?
00:12:50 Imagine having another person in your room ever. Ugh. No, thanks.
00:12:55 Uh, I, I suppose I'm gonna, did he used to record, like, like, like we'll, oh wait,
00:13:04 oh, he's gonna be gone though, I think. Is that official? Is that official? I think it's official?
00:13:09 I don't know. We were talking about this last episode. I don't know. You never know, you never
00:13:13 know, you never know what that guy, you never know what'll stick. Well, it's, it's not even just,
00:13:16 it's, it's, it's everyone. You never know with anyone, you know, you never know who's going
00:13:19 where, you never know what's going on. But what we do know is that me and Ben, we're gonna be
00:13:24 together and we're gonna be able to, we're gonna be roommates. Oh, oh, oh, opening a monkey house,
00:13:32 or sorry, wheelhouse, don't mind if I do. We're gonna be bridesmaids. Hmm, always a bridesmaid,
00:13:38 never a kingpin, as they say. Yeah, I see. Always a consort, never a kingpin. Sad.
00:13:48 I want Tom to fucking move into a monkey house so bad. You keep, you keep begging him to you,
00:13:52 keep saying like, hey, there's a spot open, and he was responsible for that stupid fucking thinking
00:13:56 emoji. He never actually thinks with his real brain. He just lets the emoji do the thinking for
00:14:03 him. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, I mean, I mean, he's not gonna leave, he's not gonna leave Digi's
00:14:10 place because he's got a, he's got a sweetheart deal there. So, I mean, sure, you know, what happens
00:14:18 with Digi's place doesn't exist. Yeah, I don't, so until, I think until Digi's place doesn't exist,
00:14:23 or is confirmed to soon not exist, he probably isn't even gonna think about it. And at that point,
00:14:30 will come the time when he must choose like, okay, do I live in a real house or do I just,
00:14:36 or do I live in my car? He's not gonna commit to anything until, until such time as that.
00:14:43 Also, you can't see this, but I'm using, I found, I've never used this weapon before,
00:14:47 it's called mutation. And it's just a big fucking glob in my arm. And it just shoots out big, like
00:14:53 Akira fucking flesh goo that like splatters blood all over all the walls. Perfect thing to hunt
00:14:59 the rowdy rat with, I should think. Speaking of mutations, we're gonna be reading the mutations
00:15:04 contest on stream. So, look at that. Oh, right. Well, click it at noon. Click it at noon. Sorry.
00:15:12 Click it after this episode is over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It immediately, immediately. There will be
00:15:18 no delay. We will plan it out. We will plan it out. We will plan it out. We think you were doing
00:15:22 anything other than listen to RFCK today. You're, you're, you're, you're so embarrassed for you.
00:15:27 Ben, we gotta do this show monthly. We gotta do it monthly. We gotta have an episode out monthly.
00:15:31 We gotta have a stream out biweekly. We gotta get some sort of fucking schedule here,
00:15:35 because we're, we're hemorrhaging slubs, dude. We're fucking no one, no one remembers RFCK.
00:15:39 By the time we released the episode, everyone was just like, huh? Last, last one was when I,
00:15:43 you know, was two years ago. I don't even know who you guys are anymore.
00:15:46 I mean, sometimes I forget.
00:15:49 Ah, that's a nice, yeah. I wish I could forget. Ben, I'm sure you had this.
00:15:55 I'm sure you had this, but I've reached the point in my endless war developer career,
00:16:00 where every single time I go to sleep, I just am like, oh, slime court. Oh, oh, oh,
00:16:05 what weapon rebalance? I just toss and turn. That was, that was, that was me in my brain.
00:16:10 That was me in the first couple months. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe the first six months or so.
00:16:15 Like, like last night, I just got into bed and like for seriously, like two hours,
00:16:21 like not a joke, like I watched the time fly. I would try to close my eyes, try not to think
00:16:26 about updates to the game, fail miserably and start writing down notes in my phone. I would open it
00:16:32 up and I would just like the light on my phone would blast my eyes fully awake again and the
00:16:36 process would repeat over and over again. Here's the thing. Here's, here's the thing about being
00:16:42 mean or probably any sort of art idiot like me. There's too much to do in life, right? You know
00:16:49 what I'm talking about. There's too much to do. I feel, you know, I feel bad that I haven't been,
00:16:56 I haven't, I haven't been as active in the endless war. I've probably been saying this for a long
00:16:59 time because this has been true for a little while, but I'm like, I'm, I check into the dev
00:17:03 discord once in a while. I'm not like actively developing anything right now because I've,
00:17:07 I've sort of taken a step back and I've really buckled down on like my
00:17:11 comics, basically. That's, that's, that's where I'm at. And whoops, should I not save this on the
00:17:18 rfck? Am I being a downer? No, no, no, no, Ben. Okay, listen. All right. Like, what's the most
00:17:26 important thing about rck? Is it making do fucking kill was happy? No, it's being real. It's about
00:17:31 being wrong. It's about saying the actual shit, right? Not the fake shit, not the phony shit.
00:17:36 Yeah. Um, true. And I mean, I'm still like around, like I'm still on discord and everything. Sure.
00:17:42 Sure. Yeah. Um, you know, you know, you know, it's, you know, really, it's the gamers fault.
00:17:48 It's the players fault because we never did hit 100, uh, 100 x's in the secret project.
00:17:55 Uh, we never, we never even hit 50. So, you know, uh, I could blame myself and my own decisions,
00:18:00 but that sounds lame. Uh, so it's your fault. The listener, you're still ahead of type of
00:18:05 recording this. You're still ahead. So we'll see. We'll see how you fare ahead of what, uh,
00:18:11 in, in slime, in slime, in kingpin slime. Oh, Ben, do you remember the mechanics of the game?
00:18:16 Do you remember? That's not what I was talking about. Um, but okay. Yeah. I mean, I mean, I spent
00:18:23 chin up is what I'm trying to say. Oh, I mean, I've been ahead in slime for, I mean, that's,
00:18:27 I'm not even worried about that. The killer's got, got the slime on lock. Um, uh, you're, you're,
00:18:33 okay. I will say if there's one thing, okay, in this war, RCK, the server in general,
00:18:40 is sort of a bad mistake. Yeah, unironically in a way. Wait, wait, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. It's just
00:18:48 cause the people in it are so, they're so active. They're so active. You, like you miss a day and
00:18:57 you're fucked forever and they forget about you. Yeah. So I, I can like not tune in for like a week
00:19:03 and everyone's like, Oh, another absentee father. Oh, oh, my munchies just fucking gone. Ben, a
00:19:08 munchie. You don't even check the game. Hey, munchie, do you know what the, do you know what the
00:19:11 street race is? Yes, I know. I'm sorry. Like I'm not in literally every single fucking day.
00:19:17 Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's kind of, yeah. It's, it's a fast pace. You know, it's fast.
00:19:24 It's very fast. I mean, there's just a lot, there's just a lot to do. There's just a lot going on
00:19:29 over there. I will say that your presence has, has been missed by many people to the point where
00:19:36 the killers don't like recognize you as the valid ruler or as a entity that exists. Okay.
00:19:45 Go on. Tell me more. Well, no, like everyone says fuck Ben. Oh, that's what I'm trying to say.
00:19:51 Okay. That's a little more, that's a little more than you're, oh, fuck. The thing about,
00:19:58 the thing about Gungan is you really got to perfect the bosses. You really got to perfect
00:20:02 the bosses if you want to make it in this life. I'm really fucking this run up, by the way.
00:20:06 But you're on a let's play show. That's expected. Yeah, true. I mean, whatever, what kind of
00:20:11 attention would there be if I, if I, if I got him first try? Yeah, no. Ben can play this game
00:20:17 blindfolded when he's not talking. Well, I don't know. Well, I mean,
00:20:25 okay. Okay. Were we talking about, oh yes, I am a bad person. Yeah. Well, bad father specifically.
00:20:32 Bad father specifically. Um, yeah, I'll come back one of these days.
00:20:41 I'm still, you know, I went out, you know, I took a trip. I went out to get some jewel pods.
00:20:46 I still haven't come back, but you know, don't give up hope. Don't give up hope. Oh god. 25
00:20:52 slime coin for a rip of that jewel, please. It's more precious than slime coin. Oh god.
00:20:59 You ever know slime coin is fake, is fake Chuck E. Cheese slime bucks?
00:21:03 No, don't tell them they have to donate. Oh, right. Are we going to keep our sponsorship
00:21:07 deal with fucking energy and subsidiary, uh, uh, slime core slime? Yeah, actually slime
00:21:13 corp has made it has, has incentivized us heavily not to acknowledge the obvious truth of that. So,
00:21:20 I'm just gonna, don't worry about it. Don't worry about anything that's gone here. Stop
00:21:24 watching this video right now. Oh, what, okay. What's going to happen when we shit talk their
00:21:28 Chuck E. Cheese money? They're going to stop paying us and said Chuck E. Cheese money and then we
00:21:32 won't have any more Chuck E. Cheese money. And then how will we play speedball? Yeah. Yeah.
00:21:38 How will we play the stocks? How will we earn, how will we earn tickets to buy a little plastic
00:21:43 rings that look like spiders? Chuck E. Cheese is so like, I, I've never been to an arcade that
00:21:53 was actually good. I feel like they've, there's a thing they are, they exist. Like they must be
00:21:59 people like arcades. I mean, you ever been to like the aesthetic of them are cool. But I've never
00:22:03 been to one that was actually good. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. I'm just talking over you.
00:22:07 Right. Sure. I mean, you ever been to like a David Buster's? Now keep in mind, I would never go to
00:22:12 a David Buster's because it's totally human core and it's like $40 for a play of crazy taxi.
00:22:18 Human core? I don't know if I would call it human core. I would call way overpriced to
00:22:22 overrated, which I guess is also human. Things that are overpriced are human. Those are,
00:22:26 there's so much overlap between those two concepts. Yeah, you know what? Okay, that's fair.
00:22:32 I've been to David Buster's. I don't know. It, that's like, that's like, if you want to go to
00:22:37 Chuck E. Cheese, but you don't want to admit yourself, you're going to Chuck E. Cheese. Yeah.
00:22:40 That's what David Buster's is, where it's like the same thing. Yeah. It's still like in all,
00:22:45 in all ways that mean anything. Yeah. I mean, yeah, it's just adult Chuck E. Cheese, which is fine.
00:22:52 I mean, I don't even think it sucks too bad. Like I went to one once, played some video games.
00:22:57 That's fine. It's just the cost like a dollar per play of, I don't know, virtual fighter or
00:23:01 whatever. It's a nightmare. God. Or at least it did when I went. I love the idea of stuff like
00:23:08 bowling alleys and arcades and stuff where she's kind of like you hang out. When was the last
00:23:13 time you went bowling? Dude, when I was like six. That's an over exaggeration. Like probably like
00:23:20 12. Probably like 12. Bowling is way fun. Also, I died. Bowling is sick as hell. Bowling is great.
00:23:26 I have a fascination with celebration, a.k.a. the most common bowling alley carpet pattern here.
00:23:34 If you, if you start, I think, I think it was like celebration. I can picture it in my mind.
00:23:38 It's purple, right? And it's not like zigzags or maybe blue. No, but you're probably thinking of
00:23:45 one of them. You're probably thinking, I mean, there are multiple. There are multiple. The one
00:23:48 I'm thinking of is this right here. Hold on. This is my favorite pet. Well, you're at tab back over
00:23:54 Discord. Whatever. Yeah, that's close. That's close to what I was thinking of. Oh, it's so cool.
00:24:03 This is my entire personality right here. Oh, I guess I got to show it on screen.
00:24:10 This is your, this is your background for your Twitch or something? Yeah, it's my
00:24:18 background for a lot of things, I think. It used to be like a pretty heavily,
00:24:24 this was a large piece of branding for me back in the day, like when I was first starting out,
00:24:28 but since how much, how much did you, how much did it cost you to license that?
00:24:34 Zero dollars because I work on the internet and
00:24:38 no one cares about you. Yeah, it's not matter at all. God is fake and hell yeah, dude.
00:24:46 You know, I often think how pretty often a lot of the stuff that people do online is like
00:24:52 clearly not fair use and just is. But it doesn't matter. Yeah, but it just doesn't matter at all.
00:24:59 Nobody's going to actually do anything about it. Yeah, so why should it matter?
00:25:05 Yes, I got the cat bullet king throne. A cat throne to hunt the rowdy rat.
00:25:14 Sourpus turns against his master. I think maybe I stole this from Sourpus. Maybe Sourpus
00:25:20 was sitting on this throne. I'm just floating around. Whoa. Oh, it's so cool. I've never had
00:25:28 this item before. God, I wish you could see it. You'd be so impressed. I doubt it. I doubt it.
00:25:36 You know, I just realized I could probably actually adjust the screen, the screen size and get rid
00:25:44 of these borders. Whatever. She would be breaking the fourth wall though. Because we can't do that.
00:25:52 Obviously K is the opposite of a meta of a meta show in every way that possibly could be. That's
00:25:58 correct. By the way, going back to one thing that I skipped over just to talk about how I'll be in
00:26:04 Boston forever now. Get into college. I want to like someone who was received in Oscar or a Tony.
00:26:13 I just want to thank everyone who said good job, Munchy, or said go for it. I also want to thank
00:26:21 Nate because he wrote a letter of recommendation. And I like to imagine some small part. Nate was
00:26:27 responsible for at least 1% of me getting in. So good job, Nate. I know you're listening.
00:26:32 Well, that was pretty nice of him. It was pretty nice. It was a nice, nice, nice thing to do there.
00:26:38 Hey, actually, did you get to read it? Yeah. Because you were in my essay. I had to write my
00:26:45 entrance essay. Oh, geez. Did I ever show you it? Did I ever? No, I don't think so. It was about the
00:26:56 Spicy Bro Pact. You've told me about this, but I haven't read it. Hold on. I don't think you like,
00:27:03 yeah. Hold on. I thought it was like a secret. Hold on. I'm going to read this on the show for
00:27:11 RCK, for prosperity. I'll also link it in the description. Okay. Hold on. That's not weird or
00:27:17 anything. Is it weird? No, it's fine. No, it's fine. I'm joking. It's real small to see. It's really
00:27:27 it's really funny. Let's see here. Six disheveled men sit in front of a large plate of blistering
00:27:34 in the hot buffalo wings ready to record a video of their feast for an audience of strangers.
00:27:39 So they will be involved in a Spicy Bro Pact, elevating their meager friendship with the highest
00:27:43 form of union one can have with their bros. Forge will eat the hot chicken wings available and
00:27:48 preferably crying in the process. Become rotary experienced while sweating through the agony
00:27:52 together lasts a lifetime. Is it for a matrimony unparalleled and sensitive mentality to me? And
00:27:58 I had been nervously anticipating it as much as one would their traditional marriage. Organizing
00:28:03 their cunning supper had been a pipe dream for so long that I can now even hardly believe I fucked
00:28:08 up whatever it was. This gaggle of men in their late to mid twenties had been my mentors for several
00:28:14 years now and I they're young ward. Yes, excellent. Yeah, make young ward a thing. It's already a
00:28:24 thing and I'm glad about it. Oh, it totally is already a thing. Whenever I have an opportunity
00:28:30 to describe myself in relation to the PC guy, always use young ward to specifically offline
00:28:38 That's a yeah. Whenever I describe you, I always say yeah, he's obviously a young ward.
00:28:45 Like who's this monkey guy? He's my young ward, don't worry about it.
00:28:49 It's like weirdly descriptive in a way where you can like it kind of clicks more than it would.
00:28:54 Yeah, I don't know. It's a great term. You came up with it, right?
00:28:59 Well, I mean, it's from Batman, but I mean, I'm the one that started using it.
00:29:04 Sure. Sure. That's what I mean. Yeah. A mixture of online artists, musicians and writers,
00:29:09 all of them especially in niche content. But by the way, the prompt of this was a describe an
00:29:16 experience that has shaped your life. So the PCP is shaped in my life. You see the collective work
00:29:23 body of work includes everything from comics of autobiographical, autobiographical, homoerotic
00:29:28 mishaps in Germany to sprawling medi narratives, dwelling in the philosophical quandaries,
00:29:32 interwoven across poorly edited reviews. Wait, who had homoerotic autobiographical?
00:29:37 You. You. In what line? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. It was homoerotic on someone else's part.
00:29:48 Well, that doesn't make it any less homoerotic. You know what? You're right. You're absolutely
00:29:52 right. And I fucked up. Plus it was funny to say homoerotic. Yeah, it's just what could be more
00:29:58 funny. Yeah. Okay. If you're if you're a woman and you're gay, it's not very funny. But if you're
00:30:05 a man, you're gay, it's super funny. It's super funny. It's I mean, it's a little fun. You know,
00:30:11 let's be honest. It's kind of strong. It's kind of fun. Yeah, it's kind of fun. After finding each
00:30:16 other's work over the internet, the band together to create it into a creative force with a totally
00:30:20 unique artistic voice and counterculture aesthetic. Yeah, it's pretty accurate. Though the game of
00:30:27 being a freelance artist on the internet is to appeal to the wider, this possible demographic
00:30:30 to his crew as many donations and patrons as possible. Their work was less concerned with
00:30:35 being digestible as it was expressing themselves with uncompromising zeal to any other person.
00:30:40 This motley, cruel social outcast might have been the subject of ire, but not for me. They were
00:30:45 everything I aspired to be. Oh, jeez. Oh, fucking shucks. You fucking asshole.
00:30:53 Growing up, I was bullied often and ostracized by almost everyone in my school. I feel like there
00:30:58 was no one that could understand me or the offbeat comments I doled in my sketchbooks. That is,
00:31:02 until I found them. Never before I had resonated with art in such an intimate way. There aren't
00:31:06 speaking directly to the part myself which I had to hide on a daily basis. I found kindred spirits,
00:31:11 and so I began to weasel my way into their inner circle, beginning with sending intentionally
00:31:16 terrible pickup lines to various members of the group every single day for months and progressing
00:31:20 to assorted mischievous acts of ironic self-humiliation. You never sent me a single pickup line, you
00:31:26 fucking asshole. Uh, you're right. Greatest regret. Greatest regret. I began to be viewed as some sort
00:31:34 of cartoon character in the creative consciousness. That's correct. It was all working exactly to plan.
00:31:39 Their door to their hearts was shitty performance art. That's too too too accurate. But it wasn't
00:31:49 but it wasn't all post-modern hijinks. For the first three years after discovering the group
00:31:54 were perhaps the most productive my artistic career thus far. I pressured myself to lip to the
00:31:59 work ethic of the group exemplified, which meant spinning every moment I wasn't getting beat up at
00:32:04 school, working on my creative pursuits. No, I fucked up. Did you die? I didn't die. I just I
00:32:11 fucked up and I forgot to save keys for the oubliet. Um, that's fine, whatever. That that been like
00:32:19 that sentence had no effect on me whatsoever. Boy, if you could see this gameplay, you would be so
00:32:26 you would be so fucking stoked for me right now. That's all I'm saying. Okay, continue. Oh, no. Oh,
00:32:32 no, I didn't get the bloopy blop so I could kill the get the gock. That's right. Yeah, pretty much.
00:32:37 How do you know? Are you a pro? Are you an MLG?
00:32:41 Let's just say that I've saved a few frames in my day. You know, back in the day, heroes would
00:32:46 save dames. Today, heroes save frames. Literally gonna make a t-shirt. We should make an rfck
00:32:52 spreadsheet and put that on a t-shirt, not a joke. Yes, that's brilliant. That is a 10 out of 10.
00:32:58 That is, I want that on my person. Click the link in the description. Yes.
00:33:05 Or you're a fucking loser. Okay.
00:33:08 There was a slow burn, but in early 2016, I was officially declared a member of the group.
00:33:13 In the three years I've seen with my mentors, now lifelong friends, I've grown as a person
00:33:17 as an artist. They fostered my strange sense of humor and artistic expression and in turn,
00:33:22 I blossomed into complete freak. Instead of doubting myself, I press on to even more uncomfortable
00:33:27 and bizarre summits, all because of the men who shower on an as needed basis. And so, I demanded
00:33:33 we seal the deal. Theoretically, we could have just eaten wings together in a Skype call, but you
00:33:37 can't see your friends cry over the internet. So, soon we were recording our feast. It's self
00:33:43 another art piece I would edit and release online. Immediately, my cold feet were worn by the inferno
00:33:48 of spice enveloping my entire body. My friends began to wail in pain, cursing my name with every bite.
00:33:54 That's right. I remember that. I remember doing that.
00:33:56 It was great. Though I explained its purpose in depth, I doubt they appreciated the
00:34:00 sentimentality of the dinner as much as I did. Tears ran down from my face from a mixture of
00:34:04 passion and the, I don't know how to pronounce it, it's canine. It's not the word canine, it's a spice.
00:34:14 I have no idea. There's a spice called canine?
00:34:17 Yeah, see, oh, I'm not going to spell it, fuck you.
00:34:21 Spell it, spell it, spell it, spell it, spell it.
00:34:24 C-A-Y-E-N-N-E. Oh, canine.
00:34:28 Canine, sorry, canine. I finally knew what it was like to be loved, to belong. I felt the
00:34:33 compassion of my fellow man and it was excruciating. And that's what got me into college, was us doing
00:34:39 the spice of Ropak. That was the end? It was excruciating was the last time?
00:34:42 Yeah, it was excruciating.
00:34:46 Well, I wouldn't have accepted you, but you know, different strokes, I guess.
00:34:51 You know, one man's trash.
00:34:56 I really do. I'm really happy, you know, I'm really happy I got into this group, genuinely.
00:35:03 No, no, I'm, there were some people last episode that felt like I-
00:35:09 Last PCK episode or RFCK episode?
00:35:11 No, no, RFCK episode in the comments, who I think thought that I was being sort of, I don't know,
00:35:18 mean in a way to some of the other members of the group, because I was a little bit,
00:35:22 I don't know, maybe noided that Boston wasn't going to be the place, wasn't going to be the location.
00:35:28 But I am, I could not express how happy I am to be friends with everyone in the group.
00:35:35 So don't think that, please.
00:35:38 Yeah, well, I don't. So that's fine.
00:35:42 That's fine.
00:35:42 Viewers, get your fucking heads on straight.
00:35:47 And fucking please buy, fuck energy.
00:35:50 And please buy RFCK.
00:35:51 Use the link in the description.
00:35:53 Yeah, if you would be so kind.
00:35:55 I think I'm going to fuck this up.
00:35:56 I don't think I'm going to have enough money.
00:35:59 I thought it's up and didn't get to the ooble yet, and I'm not going to have enough bullets to get to the ratty rats den.
00:36:05 Well, can I click on an audible link so I can transfer you some more money?
00:36:09 What?
00:36:11 You say you're not going to have enough money?
00:36:12 Well, give me an Amazon link and I'll fucking give you some.
00:36:16 Well, okay. Well, I'll click down in the description, obviously.
00:36:23 That's what any good good fan would do.
00:36:28 Now is probably a good time to complain about Oolulia and how he's too fucking dumb to let me make money for him by recording a stupid audio book.
00:36:35 Oh, yeah. Okay. I know about this, but there's a lot of people who don't.
00:36:40 A lot of people who are just thinking like, oh, what, Ben, you couldn't get, you couldn't get Oolulia.
00:36:45 Why am I so lazy? Why didn't I make that thing? I said I was going to make.
00:36:49 Who's the dude who made Tales Control?
00:36:51 Laserbot.
00:36:53 Oh, you let him slip through your fingers just like Laserbot.
00:36:55 You just couldn't get Laserbot on. You just couldn't do it.
00:36:58 Yeah.
00:36:59 Please explain.
00:37:01 Well, okay. So I was going to, you know, I wanted to make the, I wanted to make the audio book for
00:37:10 a legend of the elemental masters.
00:37:14 So I just, you know, a couple of times I contacted Oolulia on Facebook and I was just like, hey, let me do it.
00:37:20 Finally, he got back to me and I actually managed to talk him into doing it.
00:37:24 And he actually was like, you know, it's.
00:37:27 Oh, shit.
00:37:28 Well, you didn't know that?
00:37:29 I, I, no, I, well.
00:37:30 What the fuck? What did you think I was going to say?
00:37:31 No, no, no, no.
00:37:32 Well, okay. I guess I wasn't caught up.
00:37:34 I thought that you had tried for all the time and he just was refusing.
00:37:39 Oh, you're way behind.
00:37:40 No, he never refused.
00:37:42 Well, it was mostly like the first couple of times he was procrastinating actually doing it.
00:37:46 You're, I can't tell if you're like a behinder ahead on this.
00:37:50 There's continue.
00:37:52 Okay. So I, I, he finally, he responded on Facebook and I was like, hey, I want to make,
00:37:58 I will record an audio book for you.
00:38:00 I want to put it on YouTube.
00:38:01 And he was like, well, I'm only comfortable with like the first two acts going on YouTube.
00:38:06 And I'm like, okay, well, what about the rest?
00:38:09 And we talked about it and we said that I could make the audio book version
00:38:14 and I looked into it and I figured out how you do that and how you release it through Audible.
00:38:20 And I was like, okay, well, let's do that.
00:38:22 So I made an, an Audible account, you know, of the, of the kind you got to do to go through
00:38:27 the, the correct channels.
00:38:29 I did all that.
00:38:30 I got him to start making an account.
00:38:32 And then at some point he's like, uh, I think it's, I think he probably had to enter his tax
00:38:36 information or something.
00:38:37 And he was like, okay, I've been working on this for a while.
00:38:40 I will, you know, I'll do the rest tomorrow.
00:38:43 You know, months later, months later, every now and then I'll message him and be like,
00:38:48 Hey man, you ever get that thing made?
00:38:50 And he's just like, I'm playing a lot of Skyrim.
00:38:52 No, yeah, that's the point of the story that I'm at is that I knew that he, he,
00:38:57 he agreed to, and that you were under the, the impression that you would be able to.
00:39:01 Yeah.
00:39:01 It's, and he is totally fine with me.
00:39:03 He just is too fucking, I'm so mad.
00:39:06 I'm just, it's not that he's too late.
00:39:07 It's that he's too stupid.
00:39:09 It's that he's too stupid.
00:39:11 I'm not kidding.
00:39:12 Seriously, I have, this makes me so fucking mad.
00:39:16 Literally, I literally, I just want to make money for him.
00:39:20 Also, also me, but also him.
00:39:22 You're so connected, but to the wrong people.
00:39:26 Yeah.
00:39:27 Yeah.
00:39:27 It's like, you have, like, you know, people, you, you have contacted and spoken to people
00:39:33 who many others would consider like a big, like,
00:39:36 you've talked to Crixie.
00:39:38 What the fuck is that?
00:39:39 The fuck is that?
00:39:43 Sad.
00:39:46 Okay, cool.
00:39:47 Sick mom, I'm, I'm recording for the internet.
00:39:49 Do you want to say something over the internet?
00:39:54 Hi.
00:39:55 Hey.
00:39:56 Okay.
00:39:57 All right.
00:39:57 Thanks.
00:39:58 Thanks mom.
00:39:58 Good to have you on as always.
00:40:00 Pleasure.
00:40:02 That was great.
00:40:03 Okay.
00:40:04 Anyway, like you've talked to Christian, like that's so crazy.
00:40:07 Like what?
00:40:08 Talking to Christian is a nightmare.
00:40:10 That's so fucking dumb.
00:40:11 And also stuff like this where it's like,
00:40:13 I can't believe you talked to that law cow.
00:40:15 I can't believe you talked to this person, but like it doesn't matter.
00:40:19 They don't, they don't do anything.
00:40:20 They're, they're pointless.
00:40:21 They're, they're fucking useless for a reason.
00:40:24 Like they, there's a reason that their reputation is what it is.
00:40:29 You know, people like Lilia, but like this has made me like not like him.
00:40:33 Like I don't think I even like him.
00:40:34 Yeah, I'm really fucking pissed at him.
00:40:36 I don't know.
00:40:37 Maybe one day if the book, if he lets me make his fucking book for him,
00:40:42 maybe I'll like him again.
00:40:44 But not, not like this.
00:40:46 This is bullshit.
00:40:47 This is some bullshit.
00:40:50 Literally all he has to do is just like finish making his account.
00:40:52 And then it would just be a matter of him like approving the things that I make
00:40:55 and just being like, okay, go through done.
00:40:57 Literally that would be it.
00:40:59 All he has to do is fucking enter his tax information
00:41:01 and then he'll get free money from me, from my labor.
00:41:04 Man, maybe he doesn't like, he doesn't, he doesn't trust you or something.
00:41:08 I can't imagine why.
00:41:09 I mean, there's no-
00:41:10 Do you think it's a little bit too lazy?
00:41:12 He's just, he just literally-
00:41:12 Yes, yes, yes, yes.
00:41:14 100%.
00:41:15 There's nothing else.
00:41:17 What an asshole.
00:41:18 Yeah.
00:41:23 Boy, that pisses me off.
00:41:25 It would have been, imagine Ben saying-
00:41:27 I spent like-
00:41:28 Like, like audio book narrator.
00:41:30 Yeah, right?
00:41:31 I spent like two days recording and editing a demo version of like the first act or two acts.
00:41:38 It's about 15 minutes worth of like book audio for him to just listen to and approve
00:41:44 before I start like making the audiobook proper.
00:41:47 All he would have to do is approve it.
00:41:51 That's it.
00:41:51 And he just, he just-
00:41:53 No, he's kind of busy playing Skyrim.
00:41:56 It's not even, it's not even a new game, it's Skyrim.
00:42:00 It's actually, it's not Skyrim anymore.
00:42:02 He switched to some other stupid thing.
00:42:04 I don't know what it is.
00:42:04 Okay, but just as retarded.
00:42:06 Yeah.
00:42:12 Why are we cursed?
00:42:13 Why are you cursed to only have internet clout to interact with retarded, crazy people?
00:42:19 Maybe I should try interacting with some better people.
00:42:23 You've got, you're a big YouTuber.
00:42:26 You're a big poke YouTuber.
00:42:27 Surely you could throw your clout around.
00:42:29 You, you, you can't get Lilia to let you do his audiobook.
00:42:32 You can't get your vape.
00:42:34 You can't get Ben St. Vapor sold physically.
00:42:36 What, Ben, you gotta make a change.
00:42:37 I can't, I can't do a damn thing.
00:42:38 You can't do a damn thing.
00:42:41 I gotta, you gotta use it or something or else what am I, or else what's the point of
00:42:44 even having it?
00:42:45 It's gonna decay.
00:42:46 It's gonna have life, half life of two weeks max.
00:42:50 And where's the poo video?
00:42:54 Jesus Christ, Ben.
00:42:56 Jesus Christ.
00:42:56 Speaking of, low art has still, you know, months later, low art still hasn't gotten around to
00:43:02 releasing that fucking Poo's Grand Adventure podcast we did.
00:43:06 Don't know, don't know what his excuse is.
00:43:08 I don't even know who low art is.
00:43:09 He's a fucking guy, whatever.
00:43:11 It doesn't matter.
00:43:12 I'm gonna search low art right now.
00:43:14 He, uh, he, he did a bunch of videos about, uh, like retrospectives on Teen Titans that
00:43:20 got pretty big.
00:43:21 I think he's at like 40k.
00:43:22 Cool.
00:43:23 Yeah, okay.
00:43:24 Yeah, he's at 48k.
00:43:26 Yeah, and we recorded a podcast together and he just has been months and he just hasn't
00:43:31 released it.
00:43:31 It was the same, it was the same for Internet Dream Lounge.
00:43:35 That was, that's, you know, Mary, Maryweather and this.
00:43:38 Yeah, yeah, I know that is.
00:43:39 Yeah, you know, I was on, uh, his, his cohort had me on his podcast, did an interview with me.
00:43:46 You know, months go by and then he's just like, uh, actually I think the show is canceled.
00:43:53 I think it's really, yeah.
00:43:56 Wait, hey, am I allowed to talk about zone?
00:44:01 Why not?
00:44:01 That thing that you were, we're not gonna do a, we're not gonna write a thing?
00:44:05 Yeah, I did.
00:44:06 Yeah, I did.
00:44:06 You did.
00:44:07 Did it happen?
00:44:07 No.
00:44:08 Okay.
00:44:09 Yeah.
00:44:09 Why are you cursed?
00:44:11 I don't know.
00:44:12 I don't know.
00:44:14 That's so, that's so weird.
00:44:16 It's, it's every endeavor that you do.
00:44:19 Yeah.
00:44:21 Like every, like, you're God.
00:44:23 I don't even like to think about it, but yeah, you're right.
00:44:25 There's like all this shit that I do.
00:44:28 And then I try to like branch out with, you know, it's just, I don't know.
00:44:33 Other people just fuck it up.
00:44:35 Like when you have to work with other people, they just will fail.
00:44:38 Like it will always ruin anything.
00:44:41 Especially something like, like, okay, for, for that podcast, right?
00:44:46 Like it's a fucking podcast.
00:44:47 It's a, there's nothing, there's nothing he needs to do.
00:44:51 He thinks he needs to edit it and he's wrong.
00:44:54 Mm-hmm.
00:44:55 Uh, why do people think they need to edit podcasts?
00:44:59 Why are, why are they so fucking retarded?
00:45:02 Like, okay.
00:45:03 I can see the benefit of it if you want to, but it feels like-
00:45:06 But just don't.
00:45:07 Just don't.
00:45:08 It's fine.
00:45:09 It's fucking fine.
00:45:10 Like the release of it in any way, then there's no point.
00:45:14 It just won't happen.
00:45:15 If he, like, if he continues to think that, oh, I have to do anything, he just won't do it.
00:45:23 Uh, man, I'm getting mad.
00:45:25 You know what, you know what I'm talking about?
00:45:26 I think, I think you're in a hardcore agree with me, Ben.
00:45:29 The fact people, okay, the best kind of art is like slap-dash art.
00:45:36 Yeah.
00:45:36 Art that just is made.
00:45:38 More and more, I finally just fully recognize the fact that technical skill does not matter.
00:45:44 Means nothing at all.
00:45:46 What so ever.
00:45:46 No.
00:45:47 Means absolutely nothing.
00:45:48 It's a liability.
00:45:49 Comic that I love.
00:45:51 It's a My Little Pony flash comic that is clearly not even fucking attempted to be technically
00:46:01 impressive.
00:46:02 It's just, it's all sketches.
00:46:04 But this dude had an idea and he fucking made it.
00:46:07 And it is, some of my favorite art ever.
00:46:11 Something that shit fucking gave, and look at this shit.
00:46:14 Look at this fucking shit right fucking now.
00:46:16 Hold on, there's a fucking guy shooting at me.
00:46:17 It's so beautiful.
00:46:18 You don't need to fucking come up with all these signed documents.
00:46:22 Like fine one.
00:46:25 You don't have to come up with all these fucking structures in place.
00:46:28 You don't have to come up with anything.
00:46:30 Just, if you have an idea, just fucking do it.
00:46:33 It doesn't matter.
00:46:34 Okay, like you might think yourself, oh, but you know, I want to make,
00:46:38 what I make is good.
00:46:39 I don't want to shit something out.
00:46:40 No, no, shut up, shut the fuck up, you idiot.
00:46:43 Don't say that.
00:46:44 Yeah, that's wrong.
00:46:45 It's so, oh my fucking god.
00:46:48 It's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.
00:46:50 It's better to release a comic or anything,
00:46:53 and instead of shooting yourself in the fucking skull.
00:46:55 Yeah.
00:46:56 She's so fucking mad.
00:46:57 There's, like, this comic is perfect.
00:47:01 You, like, if there's no-
00:47:02 Would it, boy, like, I look at this and I just think, boy,
00:47:08 I wish this guy had spent, like, 10 times as long,
00:47:11 like, carefully rendering all the, like, background details.
00:47:15 Unlike these doors.
00:47:16 Like, what, these, these, they're not colored.
00:47:18 They're not colored.
00:47:19 They're not, like, they're not, like, shaded.
00:47:21 They're not, like, delicately shaded.
00:47:23 Like, they're not, like, you know, he didn't spend, like,
00:47:25 an hour fucking, like, doing, like, three-point perspective
00:47:28 to get the room looking just perfect.
00:47:30 I can't read this swill.
00:47:32 I, okay, okay.
00:47:34 Like, the thing about it, what is the point of this comic?
00:47:37 Okay, it's like a character interaction between spike and rarity.
00:47:40 What's the most important thing?
00:47:41 Oh, the dialogue and the facial expressions
00:47:43 and the, the character thing, being good
00:47:46 and easily communicating what they're feeling.
00:47:48 Does it matter what the fuck is in rarity's carousel boutique,
00:47:52 like, in the background?
00:47:53 Does it matter what her doors look like?
00:47:55 No, it doesn't.
00:47:56 I have gone, I have gone, like, I've gone, like, 10 pages,
00:47:59 I've gone, like, 10 panels and there's just been no background.
00:48:02 What the fuck?
00:48:03 Or why are they just floating in, like, a gray void?
00:48:05 This is a nightmare, right?
00:48:07 So fucking ridiculous.
00:48:08 What a plothole.
00:48:10 Okay, and you want, you want to know how I prove this?
00:48:12 You want to know how we fucking prove that doesn't matter?
00:48:14 Go back to the start bin, go back to the start,
00:48:16 go back to the title screen, go to extra, click on extra.
00:48:19 He made some panels in, like, a try to do a show at yourself.
00:48:23 No doubt, like, way less expressive, way more effort.
00:48:29 Yeah.
00:48:29 Not only did he spend, like, eat, like,
00:48:31 I'm not gonna exaggerate, like, 10 times as much effort.
00:48:33 I wonder if he, like, I wonder if he started doing it like this
00:48:36 and was like, this is a nightmare and is stupid
00:48:39 and it will, it will just, will never be done if I do it.
00:48:42 Like that.
00:48:42 I'm sure this exactly would happen.
00:48:44 I'm sure this is exactly what fucking happened.
00:48:47 This thing is really long.
00:48:48 The comic is literally, but, oh, it's, it's super long.
00:48:50 It's 400 pages.
00:48:51 Oh my god.
00:48:53 Yeah, no.
00:48:54 Never would have been happened if you just wanted to do it that way.
00:48:56 And the comic is literally better, better for it.
00:48:58 It's better because it's in the scratchy style.
00:49:00 It's better because it's this expressive.
00:49:02 It's better because he got it done.
00:49:05 It would have been, you know what?
00:49:07 Sure.
00:49:07 Maybe some people would have liked it better
00:49:09 if it was in the flash style, in the, in the track itself.
00:49:12 But guess what?
00:49:12 No one would have liked it because it never would have come out.
00:49:14 It never would have happened.
00:49:15 Yeah.
00:49:16 That's, that's it.
00:49:17 Brian Leo Malley, I heard him say on, on like
00:49:20 form spring or something, he said like anything,
00:49:22 he didn't originate this quote, but I heard it from him.
00:49:24 It's like anything done is, is automatically better
00:49:27 than anything that's not done.
00:49:29 Like no matter how good it would have been,
00:49:31 no matter how like, you know, no matter how perfect the parts
00:49:34 of it that are done are, like if it's not done
00:49:36 and it's not out, it's nothing.
00:49:38 It's, and it's, and it's, it's worse than anything.
00:49:41 It's, it's worse than even the worst piece of trash
00:49:43 that's, that's done.
00:49:45 Wrapping it around to us, the endless war
00:49:48 was not like meticulously planned.
00:49:51 It was not like, oh, we have a grand vision for this video game.
00:49:54 You know, you know, let's start, let's start building the pieces.
00:49:57 No, it just was like, it was cranked out.
00:50:01 It's blossomed into this beautiful fucking
00:50:04 unreal, unparalleled discord server video game combination.
00:50:09 That you can play in your discord server for for free right now.
00:50:12 Click the link in the description.
00:50:15 This never would have happened if like, like, like you,
00:50:18 you, you'd return and clack and like, like crack, like, you know,
00:50:21 let's like spin like a few months, like cash out this game
00:50:23 and then we'll have a big reveal, you know.
00:50:24 Let's get it like perfect before release.
00:50:26 Let's make sure it's absolutely perfect
00:50:27 before we, we put it out there.
00:50:29 Like, you know, let's polish every single second.
00:50:31 No, no thing you, you can improvise.
00:50:35 No, I mean, I, I mean, I knew if I knew,
00:50:37 I knew if I did anything like that with it,
00:50:39 then it just wouldn't happen.
00:50:40 I knew it had to be as bare bones as possible to ever exist.
00:50:46 She's so mad.
00:50:48 You know, well, you know, I don't know.
00:50:52 I don't want to seem too condescending because like,
00:50:54 I know what it's like.
00:50:55 It's like a natural, it's a natural feeling to have, I think.
00:50:58 It's, it's just like, you know, you want your art to be good.
00:51:01 You, you want to have the things you put out be nice.
00:51:04 What I'm saying is not that's like, that you're stupid for thinking that.
00:51:08 I'm saying that like, you have to understand that
00:51:12 that desire will kill you negative.
00:51:15 Yeah, it will kill you.
00:51:16 Instead of you putting out like, you think, okay,
00:51:19 if I do this, everything I put out will be perfect.
00:51:21 Instead, it's, you'll never put anything out.
00:51:23 That's what that means.
00:51:25 It seems like a great idea.
00:51:26 It seems intuitively great.
00:51:28 It's intuitively, like, of course I should work really hard
00:51:30 and make this thing good.
00:51:31 Like, what do you, what do you say?
00:51:33 And I shouldn't do that.
00:51:34 What the fuck?
00:51:35 It's, it's not even about making it not good.
00:51:38 It's just about recognizing.
00:51:40 If you think that, then like, yeah.
00:51:42 I mean, your priorities, your priorities are like,
00:51:44 about what is good, are probably like wrong.
00:51:49 You know, I don't, oh shit.
00:51:53 I don't know if it's like, I can't, I can't say like,
00:51:58 oh, these people.
00:52:00 Well, I mean, about, oh, I can say it, about low art.
00:52:03 Like, I don't think low art is just an idiot who doesn't understand.
00:52:06 I mean, he, he cranks out videos on a weekly basis.
00:52:09 So I don't understand why it, when it comes to this thing, he,
00:52:14 like, why did he bother?
00:52:15 Like, why did he bother like, going through all the effort
00:52:18 to like, do this with me?
00:52:20 If he's just going to like, leave it to language?
00:52:22 I don't know.
00:52:23 It doesn't matter.
00:52:24 It probably doesn't make any different.
00:52:25 Even if it never came out, nothing would probably happen.
00:52:27 It just annoys me.
00:52:28 I don't know what the point was.
00:52:30 I don't know what the, oh shit.
00:52:33 The, the, the reason I get so mad is I'm sure everyone
00:52:36 with a function brain can understand this because I've been there
00:52:38 because I know what it's like and I know what it, what,
00:52:40 I know the exact feelings that you go through and you just think,
00:52:43 well, like, like this is really important to me.
00:52:45 I want to make it as good as possible.
00:52:48 And I, listen, it's, it makes sense.
00:52:53 Yeah, but it's wrong.
00:52:54 It's wrong.
00:52:55 It just is wrong.
00:52:56 You just have to recognize when you think that making it,
00:53:02 perfect and good will often just mean that it doesn't happen at all.
00:53:08 And if you really care about it, then your number one goal
00:53:11 should be expressing the idea you want to express.
00:53:13 Should be making sure that it does happen.
00:53:15 Yeah.
00:53:16 Yeah.
00:53:16 I mean, you know, perfect is the enemy of the good and all that and all that shit.
00:53:21 Yeah.
00:53:22 I mean, I'm sure, I'm sure you've felt that before.
00:53:27 Sure.
00:53:27 All the time.
00:53:28 Um, part of a, I mean, I don't know, I mean, I mean, when it comes to,
00:53:38 I mean, I've definitely improved my speed.
00:53:42 I mean, this probably sounds ridiculous because for so long,
00:53:44 I wasn't putting out vapor's pages, but now that I am making them again,
00:53:47 I can tell that like, I've definitely improved my speed.
00:53:49 And a lot of that has just come from knowing what things are not worth focusing on
00:53:55 and not worth like, you know, devoting a huge amount of time and energy.
00:53:59 In Vapors One, on like the first page, there's like a small panel in the bottom right
00:54:04 that has like, you can see like their room.
00:54:08 You can see like their room in the background.
00:54:09 And I spent like hours, I spent like hours drawing.
00:54:14 Okay.
00:54:14 It's going to be embarrassing because it's not even that detailed,
00:54:16 but I spent a lot of time like focusing on that panel.
00:54:20 It's when they're sitting across from each other.
00:54:22 Yeah.
00:54:22 Not nice.
00:54:23 And there's the dot dot dot.
00:54:24 I spent a long time on the details of their room.
00:54:27 And that panel is so tiny that you can't even see it.
00:54:30 Yeah.
00:54:30 It's a, there's a complete waste, complete waste.
00:54:34 I mean, I mean, something like this, like it obviously comes from passion, right?
00:54:37 Like it's obviously like you want to illustrate this room because you feel like it's important.
00:54:41 You feel like it, like a room can say a lot about a character, you know,
00:54:44 it can say a lot about what these people are like.
00:54:46 So you feel like it makes sense.
00:54:48 But yeah, what, what, what matters more to a character, what their room looks like,
00:54:53 or them like writing dialogue and them having like an expression
00:54:57 and you being able to show that expression to other people.
00:55:00 Yeah.
00:55:00 Yeah.
00:55:01 That, that's really matters.
00:55:02 That is.
00:55:03 And that's, uh, and that's what I mean.
00:55:05 That's what, and Vapors one took like a really long time.
00:55:07 Vapors three has taken a really long time,
00:55:09 but not because I've been spending a ton of time like on meticulous details.
00:55:14 It's been because I've been working on other stuff and putting it off.
00:55:16 Um, uh, different problem.
00:55:19 We're not to say, well, might to some people sound like a backhanded compliment,
00:55:25 but because like that's a societal problem.
00:55:28 That's like people value like perfection.
00:55:33 The abstract ideal perfection way too much.
00:55:35 I like, uh, respect people like a digi so much because they, they are able to put out content.
00:55:44 They are able to just get an idea and execute it without having that,
00:55:50 that perfectionist mindset of having to just like toil over it endlessly.
00:55:55 If I had done that podcast with digi, it would have been out months ago.
00:55:59 Yeah.
00:55:59 Just it would have been out the day.
00:56:01 It would have been out the day.
00:56:02 Yeah.
00:56:03 I don't care what kind of cool editing you're going to put on that podcast.
00:56:08 He's not going to put any cool editing on it.
00:56:10 It's, it's the, that's the thing.
00:56:12 I know that he's not even gonna,
00:56:14 he's probably just going through it to like edit out like gaps or breaths or something.
00:56:18 And he's wrong to do so.
00:56:20 He is, he is un-
00:56:21 I mean that, I mean, that's just ridiculous to, to like, to procrastinate this long and taking-
00:56:27 And I think that's probably what EZK from, um, fucking, uh, uh, Internet Dreamland was doing too.
00:56:35 Gotta take those breaths out.
00:56:36 No one's going to listen to it if there's breaths.
00:56:39 Fuck off.
00:56:40 I think what we're saying here could easily be like miscontrude to being like just shit things out.
00:56:46 Just, just like, you know-
00:56:47 Yeah, that's literally what I'm saying.
00:56:49 That's literally what I'm saying.
00:56:51 It's what I'm saying too, but it just sounds wrong to some people.
00:56:54 And I don't really know how to express it in a way that won't, like,
00:56:57 I think that like, you sort of like, it's one of those lessons you might have to learn the hard way in a way
00:57:01 where you might not like get it right now while we're explaining to you and you might think,
00:57:05 oh, listen to these guys, they're, they're just, you know, they're, they're upset that whatever
00:57:09 projects they were working on hasn't come up and now they're trying to just say like, oh, shit it out.
00:57:13 But I, I am telling you, young artist commenting, you'll feel this one day.
00:57:20 You definitely will.
00:57:21 When, uh, one of your projects takes a year to come out.
00:57:24 Fuck.
00:57:24 When it's taken a week, then you'll know what we're talking about.
00:57:30 That's how I feel.
00:57:31 That's how I feel about Vapors 3.
00:57:34 That's how I feel about, uh, everything.
00:57:35 It's not, uh, arm retrieval.
00:57:40 Hmm.
00:57:40 What a nightmare.
00:57:41 What a nightmare.
00:57:43 Ben, you want to do a suicide pact?
00:57:46 Hmm.
00:57:47 Do I want to?
00:57:48 Yes.
00:57:49 Will I?
00:57:49 Maybe.
00:57:50 Sell me.
00:57:51 That has to be perfect, you know.
00:57:53 It has to be perfect.
00:57:54 Yeah, he's got to be, I don't want to mess this one up.
00:57:56 Yeah, yeah.
00:57:56 This one, you really, is worth, is worth the extra time.
00:58:00 Uh, hmm.
00:58:02 Jesus fucking Christ.
00:58:03 Hey, I just killed the cannonball rug, by the way.
00:58:05 Yeah, I hope, I knew you'd be happy for me.
00:58:08 Yeah, it's only when you, when you, when you kill that guy in the White House,
00:58:11 you know what I'm trying to say, dude?
00:58:13 Oh god, this fucking mimic.
00:58:15 Chest was a fucking mimic.
00:58:17 Don't worry about it.
00:58:17 It's fine.
00:58:18 It's fine, yeah.
00:58:20 No, I'm not gonna be fine.
00:58:21 A mimic?
00:58:21 What, what, what a ripoff of nuclear throne.
00:58:24 This game is a nuclear throne ripoff.
00:58:27 Oh, but I got a plunger.
00:58:28 I got a plunger out of the deal.
00:58:29 So it's fine, it's good.
00:58:31 God, I hope this, I hope I can buy a blank.
00:58:33 Yes, okay, because I need, I need two blanks to get into the rat's nest.
00:58:38 I'm going to the rat's nest, by the way.
00:58:40 Listen.
00:58:40 Oh, are you, are you gonna kill the ratting rat?
00:58:42 Are you finally gonna do it?
00:58:43 Uh, I mean, that's the plan.
00:58:48 Here's the thing.
00:58:49 God willing.
00:58:50 I, I have, okay, I have gotten to the rat before.
00:58:56 When you get to the rat, there's a two-phase battle followed by,
00:59:01 and I only just discovered this.
00:59:02 There is something else beyond the two-phase battle.
00:59:05 I have died on the second phase of his battle every time, except once.
00:59:10 One time I made it to the, the extra thing, and that was a real fucking trip.
00:59:15 And I'm sorry you're gonna miss it.
00:59:18 It's, it's, it's a sight.
00:59:20 It's a sight to behold.
00:59:22 It, it technically still counts as winning if you just beat the two-phase battle.
00:59:26 Like, but like, I don't know.
00:59:28 I'm sure something else happens if you do the other thing.
00:59:32 And I don't know what it is, but we'll see.
00:59:34 Who, no one knows what it could possibly be.
00:59:36 No one knows it could be.
00:59:38 Um, yeah.
00:59:40 How many of the comments do you think are gonna be, uh,
00:59:42 heavily criticizing your, your gameplay here?
00:59:46 Not that many, because I'm doing pretty good, I think.
00:59:49 That's good.
00:59:51 Ben, you, as a self-employed, self-made man,
00:59:55 who has no obligations to do anything ever in his entire life.
00:59:59 Yeah, true.
01:00:01 What are you gonna do this summer?
01:00:02 Does your life change with the seasons?
01:00:05 Do you feel like it impacts you whatsoever?
01:00:06 Not a, you know, well, not, well, I tell you what, Munchie,
01:00:11 I've fallen into a real funk lately.
01:00:14 And I think it's partially related to the season,
01:00:16 because during the winter I was so unmotivated to, uh, like go outside,
01:00:22 because it was fucking bitterly cold.
01:00:23 But like, I, I didn't, I didn't play, I mean, sometimes I did.
01:00:27 It wasn't like I never went out, but like, especially recently,
01:00:30 I've been, like, I haven't been playing Pokemon Go,
01:00:32 I haven't really been leaving the house very much,
01:00:34 I've just been working a lot.
01:00:35 And, uh, I'm thinking that I should probably take advantage
01:00:40 of the changing seasons now.
01:00:41 I mean, now it's, now we're full on into spring,
01:00:45 so there's no excuse.
01:00:47 Should probably take advantage of the changing seasons or whatever
01:00:49 to, uh, do something about that,
01:00:51 to get out there a little bit more,
01:00:54 get fucking, stop being such a fucking recluse or whatever.
01:00:57 To shut in?
01:00:58 Yeah, anyway, but I think that, so in that sense,
01:01:00 it might have some, uh, effect on me.
01:01:07 Is there anything that you particularly do outside,
01:01:09 or you just want the fresh air, which I think,
01:01:11 I think is a noble goal in it.
01:01:13 Pokemon Go is the only thing that I do outside.
01:01:16 So it's invaluable.
01:01:18 I, I, I, I found a mini-
01:01:22 Oh, it's really bad, I really fucked up.
01:01:23 I really fucked up.
01:01:25 Oh yeah, I ain't gonna get the ratty rat.
01:01:26 There's no way I'm gonna get the ratty rat.
01:01:28 Oh, come on, Ben.
01:01:30 That, you know, one job, one job.
01:01:33 I, that was a complete clusterfuck.
01:01:38 Uh, since, since I'll be living there soon,
01:01:40 I figured that I should, uh, try and come up with some, uh,
01:01:43 you know, things to do in the city,
01:01:45 because, uh, obviously it's fun to walk around
01:01:48 and play Pokemon Go, but, uh, I, uh,
01:01:51 also want to have some sort of maybe, uh,
01:01:53 a thing I, uh, want to go to, or, you know, like a vent.
01:01:56 Uh, I've been getting,
01:01:57 digging the idea of like a, uh,
01:01:59 maybe a weekly or a bi-weekly club meetup thing.
01:02:02 And I found, uh, stuff for, like that for,
01:02:05 for comic books in the Boston area,
01:02:07 like the Boston Comics Roundtable.
01:02:09 I know about that.
01:02:09 I, um, I used to go to it, um, in fact,
01:02:13 I've been meaning to go to it for like a year,
01:02:16 and I just haven't, and I don't know why.
01:02:20 Uh, it sounds, it, it seems like it would be great for you.
01:02:23 Wouldn't it?
01:02:24 I used to really like it.
01:02:26 Again, I don't know why I haven't gone back.
01:02:28 It's like every, I just put it off
01:02:30 and put it off and put it off.
01:02:32 Um, I meant to do.
01:02:33 You want to make sure it's perfect when you go there.
01:02:35 That's exactly.
01:02:35 You want to make sure it's a, it's a perfect occasion.
01:02:37 Yeah, that's right.
01:02:38 That's, that's, that's the thing.
01:02:40 Or some, it's something like that.
01:02:42 I feel like shit now.
01:02:45 Now I'm remembering that I have, uh,
01:02:47 failed to avail myself of this thing.
01:02:50 Yeah, I used to have a lot of fun going to that.
01:02:52 Uh, did it accomplish anything?
01:02:54 No, it doesn't matter.
01:02:55 Got me out of the house.
01:02:56 That's the only thing that matters in this life.
01:02:58 What, when did you stop going to it?
01:03:00 If I, when I, when I moved to Digi's.
01:03:03 Oh, so you, uh, you have a lot more comments under your belt.
01:03:07 I'm sure you'd have a lot more social.
01:03:08 Not, not as many as I should.
01:03:11 Well, whatever.
01:03:12 Yeah.
01:03:13 People will look at you and say,
01:03:14 Oh my God, it's a song to you guy.
01:03:16 And then you'll say, I also draw comics.
01:03:18 And I'll go, what?
01:03:19 Yeah, I guess.
01:03:22 Uh, I guess so.
01:03:24 I mean, I was all, I mean, even before like,
01:03:26 you know, like two years ago when I used to go there,
01:03:29 there were people that,
01:03:30 I remember there were people, there was,
01:03:32 there was like one guy who like knew who Digi was
01:03:35 and was like stunned that I knew him or whatever.
01:03:39 Oh, it's embarrassing.
01:03:40 Cut that part.
01:03:41 I hate saying what I just said.
01:03:43 Cut that, wait, what, why?
01:03:46 I don't know.
01:03:46 It's fucking lame.
01:03:48 What, what, no, why?
01:03:50 Why is it, why is it embarrassing?
01:03:53 Oh, I knew, I knew a famous person.
01:03:55 Uh, that's fucking stupid.
01:03:57 What a, what a, what a shitty thing to like,
01:04:00 make any difference at all in your life.
01:04:03 You know what I mean?
01:04:04 I know, I, you know, so, so it's, it's easy when you're in your,
01:04:12 to get starstruck easily.
01:04:14 I feel, you know, if you like someone,
01:04:19 if you like, if you watch someone's YouTube videos
01:04:21 and you like them a lot and someone says they know them in person,
01:04:24 well, that's, that's, that's crazy.
01:04:26 For a second there, you know, you're like, oh my God, we'll be delighted.
01:04:29 Shut up, shut up.
01:04:29 I get it.
01:04:30 Yeah, I get it.
01:04:31 Um, but it makes me mad and I don't like it.
01:04:37 Fair.
01:04:38 Did I tell you about me going to code for Boston?
01:04:41 Did I ever give you follow-up on that?
01:04:43 I, I told you about what it is, right?
01:04:44 You mentioned it, you mentioned it,
01:04:46 you didn't give me any follow-up on it.
01:04:48 No.
01:04:49 When, when I, I was a bit, part of this,
01:04:53 just wanting to Google search things to do in Boston,
01:04:56 like meetups and stuff, I found this code for America brigade.
01:05:02 And it is a group, an organization dedicated to making a civic code,
01:05:07 which is a very nebulous concept to say the least.
01:05:11 I don't, yeah.
01:05:12 But I was intrigued by it.
01:05:14 I thought, what is that?
01:05:16 Well, I guess I'll have to find out myself.
01:05:18 So, uh, I, I went to one last time it was in Boston before I got a cold
01:05:22 and we weren't able to record Lego Star Wars.
01:05:25 You're wondering why we aren't doing Lego Star Wars right now,
01:05:27 because it got a cold and, uh,
01:05:28 You couldn't record it before it was.
01:05:30 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:05:31 I remember.
01:05:32 Uh, what, hey, when was that?
01:05:34 When did that trip end?
01:05:36 It ended like, more, no, wait.
01:05:40 Did we, did we hung out with once while you were here that time, right?
01:05:44 Yeah, yeah.
01:05:46 Who did that trip end?
01:05:48 Oh God, I have no clue.
01:05:50 I have no clue when that ended.
01:05:53 Sometime at least two months ago, I think.
01:05:56 At least.
01:05:57 Whatever.
01:05:58 Doesn't matter.
01:05:59 Okay.
01:06:00 Uh, but yeah, it sucked and it was a nightmare.
01:06:02 Anyway, I went, I went to code for Boston with, uh, with Ethan.
01:06:06 He was in town, so from our, or from RBCKCon.
01:06:09 And, uh, we went there and, uh, it was, uh,
01:06:13 I didn't really know what to expect because I was getting mixed signals.
01:06:16 On one hand, it seems like it'd be one of those things that's a
01:06:19 similar serious like, you know, we're making, we're improving the community with our code.
01:06:23 We're, we're, we're updating the government to government 2.0.
01:06:26 Literally a thing they've said.
01:06:28 Uh, and so, you know, it's, it's, um, you might think it's somewhat a high brown,
01:06:32 but then also plastered everywhere on the website was come get free pizza.
01:06:37 Come to Cove for Boston and get free pizza, free pizza night.
01:06:39 We come for Cove for Boston.
01:06:41 And I was like, okay.
01:06:42 Give me, give me, give me on a cauliflower crust and I'm there.
01:06:46 Cove for Boston.
01:06:48 Dude.
01:06:49 Wait.
01:06:49 Important, important, important.
01:06:52 Guess who's Keto?
01:06:53 My hero.
01:06:54 Guess who's Keto?
01:06:55 It's my hero, Arlo.
01:06:58 Really?
01:06:58 Arlo is a, Arlo is a Keto puppet.
01:07:00 I saw him posting about, uh, low-carb red crusts.
01:07:03 Or, I'm sorry, look, I saw him posting about no-carb pizza crusts the other day.
01:07:09 I was floored.
01:07:09 Famous for that, uh, that, that, that, that thumbnail of a video he made that was sadly
01:07:14 deleted, uh, endless war, boring to shit.
01:07:16 Yeah.
01:07:17 Uh, yeah.
01:07:18 That's the name of the show.
01:07:19 We mass flagged him and got it taken down.
01:07:21 Yeah, yeah.
01:07:22 Uh, good times, good times.
01:07:24 I can't believe, I can't believe puppets, puppets first of all can be Keto.
01:07:28 I, I replied to his tweet about the pizza crust and I was like, Arlo, I don't know
01:07:31 you were Keto.
01:07:31 I didn't even know you had him a tablet or something.
01:07:34 Yeah.
01:07:34 Um, you know, learned, learned something new every day.
01:07:37 You do.
01:07:38 Anyway, there's, there's two ways that Cove for Boston go.
01:07:40 It's either just like a bunch of hipsters, ideas man, you know, it up.
01:07:44 An eating pizza or it's a real shit.
01:07:47 I wanted to take my chances and hope that it was the hipsters ideas manning so that I
01:07:51 could possibly, uh, I don't know, somehow use it to my advantage.
01:07:54 Maybe somehow manipulate them into a plane in this war somehow.
01:07:58 This actually ties into many things in my life.
01:08:00 I'm going to do a story later about me going up to LA for a premiere of an independent movie
01:08:05 where my also goal was solely to get people in LA to play in this war.
01:08:09 But, uh, that that's basically the only, uh, operated, like the only thought in my mind
01:08:14 is how can I get people with clout to play this game?
01:08:17 Anyway, I go, I go to Cove for Boston, get some free pizza.
01:08:21 And, uh, immediately to my, uh, my shock and my horror, it's real people actually
01:08:27 accomplishing things and my, my, my influence is, uh, worthless.
01:08:33 So, so it's, it's unfortunately just, um, me kind of like it's, it, there's a couple of
01:08:39 rooms each have their own, uh, project assigned to them.
01:08:42 It's a bunch of people.
01:08:43 There's some ideas manning, but it's mostly just people working in silence.
01:08:47 So imagine me and Ethan going there to have, to, you know, just to have a good time just to,
01:08:52 you know, see, see things that just, you know, have, have a good time, party up and code for
01:08:55 Boston. And then, uh, we're shuffled into an office space where people are just silently
01:09:00 coding and somebody asked me, Hey, what are they coding?
01:09:04 Uh, well, one of them is, uh, one of them was, uh, you had to know Python, uh, but also know
01:09:10 the Alexa Amazon API is there making it so you can ask Alexa, like, I don't know,
01:09:17 fucking like, like something about health insurance.
01:09:20 I don't even remember something stupid like that.
01:09:22 Sick. Yeah.
01:09:24 Uh, the only cool thing was, uh, blocking.
01:09:26 There was a blocking Pokemon go app.
01:09:28 You know what blocking is?
01:09:29 Uh, you've told me before, but I don't remember.
01:09:33 It's, uh, it's a combination of jogging and picking up trash.
01:09:36 It's a Scandinavian thing.
01:09:37 What does it stand for?
01:09:39 It's like a portmanteau, right?
01:09:41 Yeah, it's a portmanteau.
01:09:42 It, it, it's, it's some fucking here.
01:09:44 I'm going to get it right now.
01:09:45 It's, uh, some like Danish word, I think with jogging, some shit, some fucking,
01:09:51 some stupid non-English word that I don't even care about.
01:09:54 It doesn't even matter.
01:09:55 But anyway, there was an app for that and, uh, that was, that was at least that one.
01:10:00 There were people who, uh, were ideas manning it pretty hard.
01:10:04 It was pretty in its early stages.
01:10:05 I got to watch them make a reading file, but other than that, it was a pretty boring event.
01:10:10 Yeah. Um, Boston Comics Roundtable.
01:10:14 You know, it, it was, I don't know.
01:10:20 I guess I liked, it was, it was weird.
01:10:22 There was like, you would go there and there would be like, sort of,
01:10:26 people would sit around and like, they would talk about like events, right?
01:10:29 Cause they have, they have sort of a community that does events.
01:10:32 Like they will have like tables at like local conventions and stuff, which is good.
01:10:36 That's, that's all pretty cool.
01:10:38 Um, they, they would just kind of discuss what's going on in their community.
01:10:42 Like sometimes they would have, there was one time they had like a guest speaker
01:10:46 who like spoke in like a lecture hall.
01:10:48 They used to meet at like a, the downtown, a library near Harvard Square.
01:10:52 I don't know if they still meet there, if they've changed venues, doesn't matter.
01:10:55 But they would do that.
01:10:56 And then you would, like before the meetings proper started,
01:11:00 you would post your like latest, like anything you'd drawn that week,
01:11:04 or something you'd drawn that week, you would post it on like a court board.
01:11:09 And then everyone would walk around and sort of, uh,
01:11:12 just critique each other's like stuff for the week.
01:11:16 And it was really cool.
01:11:18 Yeah.
01:11:18 That sounds really sick as hell, actually.
01:11:20 And it was a lot of, um, you know, it was a, it was a big spread.
01:11:23 There were a bunch of like college kids, uh, there were a few of those.
01:11:27 There were, um, you know, there were a bunch of older people,
01:11:31 like, like maybe middle-aged or verging on middle-aged,
01:11:34 people who were like veterans or whatever.
01:11:39 There wasn't a lot, there wasn't a lot in the middle.
01:11:42 There was, it was, it was mostly like those two,
01:11:44 I guess there were some kind of in the middle, like 30 something or whatever.
01:11:47 But it was a lot of the kids there, a lot of the college kids were like really bad.
01:11:51 But everyone was, everyone was polite about it, you know.
01:11:54 You know, everyone offered, everyone offered a constructive criticism,
01:11:57 no matter how good or terrible you were.
01:12:01 Uh, just, you know, that's fine.
01:12:03 What, what, what kind of stuff happens in it exactly?
01:12:05 Like, like, what, like, what is like the, the main thing that you do there?
01:12:08 Is it just shoot the shit and try and network?
01:12:10 It's mostly, you know, you convene about events, shoot the shit, network, critique each other's
01:12:18 work, go out for burgers afterwards.
01:12:21 Oh, burgers, I sold, sold.
01:12:24 Yeah, um, I have, uh, I feel, you know, every day, I don't know why,
01:12:30 I don't know why I haven't done it.
01:12:32 But every day I know in my heart that I'm fucking up by not going back, and I haven't.
01:12:38 Tell me why.
01:12:40 Look in my soul and explain it to me.
01:12:43 You can surely, listen, Ben, I had no idea how like big
01:12:49 Boston Comics roundtable is.
01:12:50 Maybe like 25, 30 people.
01:12:54 You can surely become a sultan there.
01:12:56 I, I, I believe that you have the ability to make people gravitate around you and become a sultan.
01:13:01 I think you can do it.
01:13:02 I was, hmm, I wasn't, I wasn't a sultan.
01:13:07 You could be one now though.
01:13:08 I mean, I was, uh, I don't know.
01:13:11 I don't know.
01:13:12 You know, maybe I'm afraid of, I think maybe I'm afraid that like I'll go and nothing will have changed.
01:13:19 What do you mean?
01:13:21 Like, I'll go and maybe, and I feel like I've been doing this whole comics thing and art thing
01:13:27 and internet thing for like, you know, two or three years since then, and I'll go back and, uh,
01:13:34 it won't be any different.
01:13:36 And I'll think like, what was any of it for?
01:13:39 You know, I'm still just a schmuck.
01:13:41 I'm still just one of these schmucks.
01:13:43 Oh, oh, so you're afraid you won't be sultan?
01:13:45 In fact, you might be a peon still.
01:13:47 Yeah. Oh God. Fuck.
01:13:49 I think that's, I think that's it.
01:13:51 I think I figured it out.
01:13:53 You also, you seem, you seem to have a, you seem to have an insecurity complex about comics, Ben.
01:13:59 You went to mice and you're just like, oh God, I'm just, I'm just a cattle.
01:14:03 I'm, I'm just a sheep to be herded here.
01:14:05 I need to be behind the booths.
01:14:07 Yeah. I hated, I hated not being behind the booths.
01:14:11 What's so wrong with being just another, another citizen of comic land here, of webcomic land?
01:14:17 You know, you'll get your just desserts one day, but for now, but you know,
01:14:21 you got to toil a little bit.
01:14:23 You got to a little bit in the sand before you can ride this to the gate and prekeat yourself.
01:14:26 No, that's not, I don't agree with your framing of the issue there.
01:14:30 Yeah.
01:14:32 Toil is fine. I'm okay with toil.
01:14:36 It's not, the problem is not toil.
01:14:38 It's not like, oh, I have to work and these, and these heroes, these champions, like lorded over me behind it.
01:14:45 It, it was that I, I just didn't, I didn't want to go there to consume stuff.
01:14:53 I wanted to go there to, you know, pedal stuff. I don't know. I wanted,
01:15:01 it's, it, this is not even like a hierarchy thing.
01:15:04 Like, oh, I'm lower on the totem pole, although that is part of it.
01:15:06 It's that like, I was there for the wrong purpose.
01:15:10 I see.
01:15:11 Does that make sense?
01:15:12 No, I feel like what you understand, like you, you were going there not because you particularly like
01:15:18 loved comics in concept, but because these are other comic artists.
01:15:22 I kind of want to rub elbows with them.
01:15:24 And I kind of want to, if not like get people to literally buy Ben St. Vapors,
01:15:29 just talk to other people in the trade, maybe not, maybe not collaborate directly,
01:15:34 but just at least, you know, get in there.
01:15:36 A bit, there's a little more to it.
01:15:39 It was like being, being there as a, as a guest, as a, as a consumer was like,
01:15:46 I wanted to be like, no, listen, you don't understand.
01:15:50 If this is a mistake, yeah, yeah, that's exactly it.
01:15:54 I wanted to be like, this is a mistake.
01:15:56 This is just an accident.
01:15:57 I'm supposed to be on the other side.
01:15:59 Listen, I'm not, I, please, like, don't, don't, don't look at me like these other freaks.
01:16:05 I actually do things like you.
01:16:09 I promise.
01:16:12 Yeah.
01:16:13 Okay.
01:16:13 There you go.
01:16:14 I, I, I get you.
01:16:17 I'm thinking, I'm thinking, what if, what if there are more people like that in that crowd?
01:16:23 What if instead of, well, that's part of it, that's part of the existential horror of it,
01:16:27 Munchie, is that I think probably there's lots of them.
01:16:31 Mm hmm.
01:16:31 And I don't know if maybe they don't feel it as acutely as me or maybe they do.
01:16:37 And we're all equally frustrated to be there.
01:16:41 But, but then if that's the case, then why not turn on each other?
01:16:44 Why, why not, why not find some solace in the fact that there are other people like that here?
01:16:51 And you know, it's just, it's, it's almost as though the, not the people behind the booths
01:16:56 are, I don't want to say luckiness as they haven't worked.
01:16:58 I'm not locked in there with them.
01:16:59 They're locked in here with me.
01:17:01 Yeah, yeah, in a way.
01:17:03 It's, it's not that they're a, they, you are a consumer, like it's a binary system,
01:17:09 either you're a creator or a consumer.
01:17:11 It's just that, you know, maybe you are blending in with the sheep.
01:17:16 You're a wolf in sheep's clothing in a way.
01:17:17 And then maybe there are other wolves, wolves in sheep clothing.
01:17:20 You can interact with them and maybe talk to them and find comradery.
01:17:25 I mean, in your, in your, well, well, it feels to me,
01:17:28 like if you were really a wolf in that scenario, you wouldn't be wearing,
01:17:33 why would you wear it?
01:17:34 Why would you be wearing sheep's clothing?
01:17:36 Like any, any, I don't want to, I don't want to hang out with these pervert wolves that
01:17:40 like dressing up as sheep.
01:17:43 Yeah, okay.
01:17:45 I think our, our metaphor is getting muddled here a little bit.
01:17:48 I feel like the game, I feel like, I feel like they were muddled as soon as they left my
01:17:51 mouth, but you know what, that's fine.
01:17:52 Um, I actually speak, speaking of that.
01:17:58 Actually now is the time for soon anyway.
01:18:02 We'll be the time to register at a table at mice.
01:18:04 So I gotta do that.
01:18:06 Oh, what's the requirement of that?
01:18:10 Is that, is that just to first come, first serve?
01:18:12 And if you're just anyone who's anyone or even just like asked nicely, you can get in.
01:18:16 I, I don't know.
01:18:18 It might be.
01:18:19 It might, I mean, there are problems.
01:18:22 I mean, there's probably some like priority people, like maybe like certain people who
01:18:26 tabled successfully at like previous events or probably people with clout like Casey
01:18:30 Green or whatever, he was there.
01:18:32 Um, like I'm sure, or Abby Howard or whatever, like I'm sure they would be like, I'm sure
01:18:37 they wouldn't be turned away already.
01:18:39 Yeah.
01:18:40 But maybe it might just be, fuck, it might just be first come, first serve.
01:18:46 Let me ask you this bit.
01:18:47 Yeah.
01:18:49 All right.
01:18:49 Two questions.
01:18:50 First of all, would you consider comics to be your main thing slash main Colin like thing
01:18:56 you want to present yourself as the most thing I want to present myself as the most?
01:19:00 Yeah, definitely.
01:19:00 Like a comics artist.
01:19:01 Okay.
01:19:01 Yeah, definitely.
01:19:03 How much do you read or interact with the independent comic scene just in general,
01:19:08 like webcomics, Boston local, just at all?
01:19:11 Almost none.
01:19:14 That's, that's what I figured.
01:19:15 Yeah.
01:19:16 Is that a problem?
01:19:18 Cause I know.
01:19:19 Probably, probably.
01:19:20 Okay.
01:19:21 A lot of, I have been thinking about this a lot.
01:19:23 The thing about online communities, thinking about how I miss the old fandom days,
01:19:27 which I'm like, yeah, yeah, whatever it is matter.
01:19:29 But I don't have a, a interest that I have where I feel like I know what other people
01:19:37 with the interest have, which feel like I have a lot of interest and I know the interest
01:19:42 themselves was pretty deeply, but I don't really know for instance, like for instance,
01:19:46 I don't really know a lot about like maybe the, the homesick community, for instance,
01:19:50 or something more broad.
01:19:50 Like I don't really know a lot about like the podcast community or just things that
01:19:55 like I do and sort of like almost like my livelihood in a way depends on.
01:20:00 I don't really have a sense of like what the community is.
01:20:03 Like, like, like I watch other podcasts.
01:20:05 Do I like know anything about how like other people view said podcasts?
01:20:10 Have I ever been in a red discussion, a forum discussion, a tweet on Twitter?
01:20:14 Have I ever seen anything like that?
01:20:16 You know, no, not really.
01:20:18 I mean, I don't know if there is something like that for podcasts.
01:20:22 Exactly.
01:20:23 Well, okay, well, sure.
01:20:25 But you get what I'm trying to say.
01:20:26 Like, I totally get what you're trying to say.
01:20:29 Yeah.
01:20:29 I felt that way about comics.
01:20:32 The comics, I feel that way as well.
01:20:34 The comics community, as I have seen it, it's really weird.
01:20:39 And I don't think I get it.
01:20:40 It's really weird.
01:20:43 What?
01:20:44 What do you, what do you like?
01:20:45 Well, okay.
01:20:46 What's weird about it?
01:20:46 What's weird about it?
01:20:48 Okay.
01:20:51 It, it just, you know, I mean, maybe I should try and give another shot.
01:20:59 Maybe, maybe I didn't like it before because I had no like cloud.
01:21:04 I had like very little work under my belt.
01:21:07 And it, and it wasn't like, and that's why it wasn't working out or whatever.
01:21:11 It just, it all feels like people just sort of like buying each other's shit.
01:21:19 Like, like artists all just like buying each other's books.
01:21:21 And like, that's, it's like a bunch of amateurs.
01:21:26 It's like a, just like a bunch of amateurs just like barely keeping each other afloat
01:21:30 with their own money.
01:21:31 That's how it felt like to me.
01:21:33 Well, what's wrong with that?
01:21:37 I hate it.
01:21:39 Yeah.
01:21:39 Okay.
01:21:40 Is that, is that the goal?
01:21:42 Is, is the goal of it to like make shit that like just you and your fellow
01:21:48 members of this community are interested in?
01:21:50 I don't think, I don't think that's why they do it.
01:21:52 I don't think that's the goal.
01:21:54 I think that's a byproduct of them wanting like thems.
01:21:59 I would say almost it's, I think like, I can empathize with a lot in almost like a selfish way
01:22:05 where it's like, I want my comic to be successful.
01:22:08 Not just like monetarily.
01:22:10 I like, I want people to know who the fuck I am.
01:22:12 How do I do that other than collaborate and to like, to mix and mingle with other comic
01:22:17 artists to get their audience into my stuff as well?
01:22:20 But, okay.
01:22:22 What, yeah, I get that, but what if everyone that you're commingling with, everyone's
01:22:28 audience is just the same other people, other people that make web comics?
01:22:34 Hmm.
01:22:36 I mean, sure.
01:22:39 But I don't know if that's, okay.
01:22:43 When you're working on the internet, I feel like that sort of thing is almost like,
01:22:49 like there's no way there's going to be one big circle for like the idea of comics.
01:22:55 Like, like the concept of a web comic, you know?
01:22:57 There's no, there's not one big circle.
01:23:00 There are like several small circles.
01:23:02 I completely understand the idea of wanting to like, just sort of like get the word out.
01:23:09 It's like, I don't, I don't think I'm communicating this well.
01:23:13 Cause like I'm not saying, it's not that I'm saying like, why are these people collaborating
01:23:18 with each other?
01:23:18 Like that's not the problem.
01:23:20 I get that the problem is just like, I don't know that I just, I see people, I see people in
01:23:31 these little comics communities, you know, sort of all it's like, you know, like, like
01:23:38 retweeting each other's kick starters and stuff and whatever.
01:23:40 And like, it feels very insular and like it's not, like it's, it feels very like circle jerky
01:23:49 in a way.
01:23:50 Circle jerky a little bit.
01:23:51 But like, in a way that's like not even their fault.
01:23:55 Like, yeah, maybe they're circle jerky.
01:23:57 It's like pathetic.
01:23:59 I don't want to say it like that.
01:24:00 Like, maybe like, it's like, yeah, there's circle jerking.
01:24:04 But I mean, who else is going to jerk them off?
01:24:06 Maybe, maybe the problem is there's nobody else is going to jerk these people off.
01:24:10 You know, maybe the audience just isn't there.
01:24:12 And that's very discouraging.
01:24:16 And would you say it's discouraging in a way where it like it makes you confront your own
01:24:20 mortality in a way?
01:24:21 Or it's like, oh, if this is all I can ever aspire to is just being like, like other people
01:24:27 also who are commissars liking my stuff.
01:24:29 Is that what you mean?
01:24:30 Yeah, that that one, that one.
01:24:35 Like, I don't know.
01:24:36 I think I said before that I'm not married.
01:24:39 I'm not married to the idea of like, comics being the thing.
01:24:44 Like, if I could do something with like a similar skill set, but in a different format
01:24:50 that would have like a bigger readership be more popular, I wouldn't have any problem
01:24:55 with doing that.
01:24:57 Um, and the web comics community sort of sort of smells to me like one that is very limited
01:25:08 in its readership.
01:25:09 And I don't know if I'm right about that because like there are comics that are successful that
01:25:15 people do read, but also by your own admission, it's you don't, it's not like something you're
01:25:20 fully invested in.
01:25:21 You would like know if like, like, you know, you weren't that involved with it.
01:25:26 That's, I think you're conflating.
01:25:28 I mean, I, I didn't say that.
01:25:31 I mean, I think I know where, I think I know how it works and everything.
01:25:36 I didn't like, I'm not invested in that as like, it has to be this or like, I'm not invested
01:25:40 in the format specifically.
01:25:43 Um, my, my, I mean, there are comics that people read that have like a decent readership.
01:25:52 But they're mostly on, they're mostly on things like, um, they're networks like
01:25:57 HiveWorks.
01:25:58 Actually, HiveWorks is like the only one I can even think of.
01:26:00 But like most, I feel like most comics that anyone actually reads are like on something
01:26:05 like HiveWorks or they're like print, print comics or something like that, or they're just
01:26:11 totally independent and like word of mouth has gotten them around like Ogloff or something like
01:26:16 that.
01:26:17 And like being independent and being known, like that, you can't make that happen.
01:26:24 That's, you can't, you can't manufacture that.
01:26:28 Um, you know, what are you even supposed to do about it?
01:26:31 I don't know.
01:26:32 Getting into something like HiveWorks, well, I tried once and it didn't work.
01:26:36 Um, and I should probably try again at some point.
01:26:39 Um, but you know, I don't know.
01:26:42 That seems like a weird, difficult nut to crack.
01:26:46 And also seems sort of, it's sort of like a, it seems just like a less embarrassing
01:26:54 microcosm of the webcomics community in its own way.
01:26:57 Like it has the same general atmosphere, just like, I mean, there are plenty of comics
01:27:03 that nobody reads on HiveWorks too, um, for instance.
01:27:08 And then print comics, I don't fucking have any clue about that.
01:27:13 I don't think I'm going to get like a, I've been thinking about this.
01:27:18 Um, the idea of like having a job, the idea that of like a publisher like paying me to
01:27:25 produce content on a schedule seems ridiculous, just seems ridiculous, like a, like a stupid
01:27:34 thing to even think about.
01:27:37 Like, I mean, I think, I think those jobs do exist, but I think
01:27:42 they are, they do not, they're not being created.
01:27:47 I don't know.
01:27:48 It doesn't, it doesn't feel like anyone is being hired to do that.
01:27:52 And like professionals say, like, like old professionals say, like these days,
01:27:57 just go indie, just, just kickstart.
01:28:00 Don't, don't, don't go through a traditional like publisher.
01:28:03 Like that's what, that's what I was confused for a second point.
01:28:05 Yeah.
01:28:05 Okay.
01:28:06 I thought, I thought that was like a comment from, uh, Ben, uh, Communism Saint, uh, just
01:28:11 like saying like the idea of the jobs were ridiculous, but you're saying like it's hard,
01:28:15 like, like, they're mythical in a way where it's like, how could you ever land one?
01:28:19 Is that what you're saying?
01:28:20 Yeah.
01:28:21 Yeah.
01:28:21 Okay.
01:28:22 Like who, like who's, who's hiring for that?
01:28:25 Uh, no one.
01:28:26 And nobody wants, I mean, I'm not, I don't have no audience, but I don't have the kind of
01:28:32 audience that like, that like a company would hire me because like, oh wow, this guy's going
01:28:36 to bring in a lot of, a lot of people with him, a lot of readership.
01:28:41 You know, yeah, I, I, I totally get you, dude.
01:28:45 I feel like it's, I, I mean, I would chalk up for me, I don't know if you would consider
01:28:51 this way, but I would just consider it an experience on my part that I don't really
01:28:54 know how the hiring process works for a lot of things.
01:28:56 Like, I, like, I, I mean, I agree with you that I have no idea how like the first thing
01:29:00 to do, but how I would even like approach a like, like, for, like, for instance, like,
01:29:05 like, like everyone who's published a, a, a comic has just like,
01:29:13 uh, well, what am I trying to say?
01:29:15 I'm trying to say that, like, okay, you think about a, a Brian Leo Malley, you think, okay,
01:29:20 how'd he get Scott, Scott Pilgrim published?
01:29:22 Well, he went to Oni Press and he had already had some work under his belt that he'd published.
01:29:27 And so he got, how'd he publish the first one?
01:29:31 No clue.
01:29:32 Like, was he just fresh off the like college or something?
01:29:34 I mean, I, I know, I know a bit about this.
01:29:38 Do you, what, how'd he do it?
01:29:41 Well, he had a comic called, um, Lost at Sea.
01:29:45 Yeah, he had a book.
01:29:46 That one, I, he had like done, okay, I don't know the exact order that these events occurred in,
01:29:54 but he had done Lost at Sea.
01:29:56 I think before that he had done some like strips.
01:30:00 He had done some like comic strips on like some website.
01:30:04 That were sort of the precursor to Lost at Sea.
01:30:07 I don't know what the deal was with those.
01:30:09 He had, I think this was post Lost at Sea pre Scott Pilgrim.
01:30:17 He had a deal with Marvel and Marvel had him draw a like Spider-Man Children's book.
01:30:28 Had him illustrate like a Spider-Man Children's book.
01:30:30 And I, in like an interview or something, he said that like,
01:30:34 that paid really well and like let him like concentrate on like his other stuff.
01:30:41 And, uh, boy, I wish I, I was thinking about that.
01:30:42 I was like, boy, God, I wish I could get paid to illustrate a fucking Spider-Man Children's book.
01:30:47 I'll bet, I'll bet it paid like crazy.
01:30:50 I, I'm sure there's like a clear, I'm just doing, I'm just like looking at his Wikipedia page right
01:30:55 now. It seems like, yeah, he was doing, he was just doing like small, small stuff at like a comics
01:31:00 studio. He was just doing the smallest stuff and doing like lettering and behind the scenes
01:31:04 stuff. And I guess you just have to like, you know, go somewhere.
01:31:07 I mean, imagine, imagine getting a job as a comic book letterer today as like a letterer or like a
01:31:14 fucking, I don't know, colorist. I mean, I guess those jobs exist.
01:31:19 Do, I don't know, do they even exist? They probably exist in some form.
01:31:23 But again, it feels mythical. It feels ridiculous.
01:31:27 I feel like, I don't know. I think we're talking out of our ass.
01:31:30 I like, surely like there's, there's answers to these questions.
01:31:36 I don't know. I've just, I've never looked it up. And I don't know. I don't even think I'm
01:31:40 complaining about it really. I, I, uh, I'm complaining about it.
01:31:45 Oh, oh, Ben, one, one day you'll be behind, you'll be behind the booth.
01:31:52 You'll be behind the booth. I can be behind the booth. Being behind the book is easy.
01:31:56 It was just an accident of history that it didn't happen.
01:31:59 It was a mistake. It was a glitch in the matrix.
01:32:01 It was. That's exactly what it was.
01:32:04 As a matter of fact. Yeah.
01:32:06 Ben, let's go to comics, boss comics round table. Let's like go together. Let's like do it.
01:32:11 Yeah. I mean, I should probably just go like this.
01:32:14 You go, go right now.
01:32:15 Just like, why not? I think they're still on Tuesday.
01:32:19 I'll check right now. I'll check right now.
01:32:21 You only, you won't even have deniability. You didn't, you didn't check it.
01:32:24 Okay. Thursday, 7 p.m. Thursday is okay.
01:32:27 Are they still at that library?
01:32:28 Is it the same way?
01:32:29 They're at Leslie college of art and design,
01:32:32 Lunder hall room 003, uh, near Porter square in Cambridge.
01:32:38 Huh. I wonder if that's a downgrade.
01:32:41 The library they used to meet at was pretty nice.
01:32:46 Open all and all are welcome to matter.
01:32:48 Your level of interest or experience in comics, beginners to experience.
01:32:51 You don't have to give a fuck.
01:32:53 Yeah.
01:32:57 Okay. We're talking about local comic events.
01:32:59 Look at each other's work in progress and generally socialize about the comics theme.
01:33:02 So this is what I wanted.
01:33:04 That's exactly what I wanted.
01:33:05 I just wanted people, ideas, man.
01:33:08 And just being like, yeah.
01:33:09 So I got this like idea about like this comic that like I'll make, you know,
01:33:14 one day when I'm just 30 years from now.
01:33:16 When I, you know, when I'm good, you know,
01:33:17 after I practice a whole bunch and you know,
01:33:19 Yeah. Yeah. After it's perfect.
01:33:20 After I really iron out all the flaws in the story.
01:33:22 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
01:33:25 Discussing.
01:33:26 Perfect.
01:33:27 Um, it sounds really cool.
01:33:29 I really want to go.
01:33:31 I don't know.
01:33:33 Okay. I feel like I do get what you're trying to say,
01:33:36 but it's a little bit insular, a little bit circle, jerky.
01:33:39 I honestly feel bad saying that because like,
01:33:42 what's the alternative that I'm proposing?
01:33:45 What would be better?
01:33:47 What would I do in their place?
01:33:49 I don't know.
01:33:50 I, I, I get your saying.
01:33:52 I don't know if I, I don't know if I, like if I feel the same way.
01:33:55 I feel like I, I don't know.
01:33:57 Honestly, like I think the only difference is that I have like the PCP and other like
01:34:02 internet stuff as like secondary creative outlets.
01:34:06 Like I'm sure for a lot of these people,
01:34:07 comics are just what they do and that's it.
01:34:11 And like, you know, nothing wrong with that, but I don't know.
01:34:17 Let me ask you this Ben.
01:34:19 Do you think, have you ever reflected upon that effect?
01:34:21 Like, do you think that's bad almost in a way that you are doubly down on one thing?
01:34:26 Yes, probably.
01:34:28 Yeah. I'm, I'm a jack of all trades and a master of none.
01:34:33 And you know, they say that to get, that to become a master,
01:34:36 you got to just buckle down on that one thing and you shouldn't do what I do.
01:34:41 Yeah. You shouldn't, you should, you have to specialize to become great.
01:34:44 And I haven't specialized.
01:34:46 I've cast like a really wide net and you know, mistake.
01:34:55 I think about, especially now that I'm staring down college.
01:34:59 Maybe I'm like, what do I want to do with my life?
01:35:01 Maybe, maybe if I had like done nothing but comics,
01:35:03 maybe I could have made some headway in the comic sphere,
01:35:07 like more than I actually have.
01:35:09 Because you know, I mean, what, what, what like actual comics headway have I made?
01:35:12 Like I had my Kickstarter that did pretty well, great.
01:35:15 But like, I mean, what does that, what does that mean in terms of like other opportunities?
01:35:22 I mean, well, I don't know, maybe it could mean something.
01:35:24 I don't know.
01:35:25 No one's fucking come to me with any job offers or anything.
01:35:28 Is that what they do?
01:35:29 Is that what's supposed to happen?
01:35:30 People email you and say, hey, I got a job for you?
01:35:33 Maybe. I don't know.
01:35:36 How could I know?
01:35:40 I think about a lot.
01:35:41 Like what do I want to do with my life?
01:35:43 Like what, what skills should I be developing right now?
01:35:45 I've had a whole, I've literally themed the year based around,
01:35:50 I want to do more with my life.
01:35:51 I want to learn more things.
01:35:53 I've been learning to animate.
01:35:54 I've been learning to play the trumpet more.
01:35:56 I've been doing a lot of things to try and broaden my horizons and get more skills.
01:36:02 But honestly, like, should I be doing that?
01:36:05 I think about like the skills that I want to use to like farther my life.
01:36:10 What do I want with my life?
01:36:11 I want to illustrate.
01:36:12 I want to, I want to, I want to do visual art.
01:36:16 And so animating works for that.
01:36:18 But just playing the trumpet?
01:36:20 No. Does, does, does having new podcast series?
01:36:24 No, not really.
01:36:25 I guess you could maybe argue that quick draws help with that because it's about drawing.
01:36:30 But that's sort of a roundabout way.
01:36:33 It's mostly my, my actual, like what I'm doing for that is I'm editing a video series.
01:36:38 It's, there's no reason to be doing a lot of things I do.
01:36:43 But it's just, it's so hard not to.
01:36:46 I mean, I think it's, I think most people would say it's a good thing to be broadly
01:36:52 experienced, you know, to have had a wide range of experiences in your life and such.
01:36:59 Sure. I don't disagree and I don't regret anything, of course.
01:37:03 But it's almost just, I feel like maybe I am wasting time in a way.
01:37:10 Maybe I should just be doubling down on, maybe I, maybe I should open up commissions again.
01:37:14 Maybe I, maybe I should just be doubling down on visual art in a way instead of
01:37:19 separating time to, maybe even like, maybe even something like R of CK.
01:37:23 Maybe I shouldn't even be, be trying to manage the community as much as I do now.
01:37:26 But I think about that and I think about like the reason to do so.
01:37:30 And it just feels like my life would be just so much duller if I did that.
01:37:36 I feel like there's such spice to having very interest and to being so,
01:37:43 like, even though it's not good for like, business, it feels good to be multi-faceted,
01:37:50 multi-faceted and like, not really easy to describe in a way where it's like,
01:37:55 yeah, I like that.
01:37:56 For instance, you, like, there's a lot of things that one could describe you as,
01:38:01 but it's hard to kind of like, succinctly do.
01:38:03 So like, you stream sometimes, okay, so you're like a Twitterer,
01:38:07 but you also do comics and, and, and different sorts of comics.
01:38:10 But you also like, do YouTube, but like, what kind of YouTube stuff do you do?
01:38:13 Well, you used to like, Pokemon Nuzlocs, but now you do like,
01:38:16 poo, any of the poo videos, but it'll usually do all this other stuff.
01:38:20 It's like, it's not really, you know,
01:38:22 you're sort of everything and therefore not really anything.
01:38:26 Yeah. And, uh, you know, that has a certain appeal for me, but I think it's, I mean,
01:38:34 I think it's bad, like business-wise, right?
01:38:37 Oh, definitely. Like, definitely, definitely.
01:38:39 Because, because what do you say?
01:38:41 Like, what's, what's the pitch?
01:38:42 Like, oh, Ben's saying, why should I, why should I support him on Patreon?
01:38:47 Well, he does.
01:38:49 And then you do a list of things that have almost nothing to do with each other.
01:38:52 It's like, maybe someone likes one of those things or two,
01:38:56 but what about all the other shit that I don't care about, you know?
01:39:00 Yeah. In a way, it's like, okay, making your business based upon the fact that you are a
01:39:08 personality is such a slippery, treacherous slope where some people can make it work really well.
01:39:14 But I feel they can only make it, they can only make it work well once they've already
01:39:19 established themselves with one trait.
01:39:22 For instance, you look at, you look at, you look at the top of the list, you look at PewDiePie.
01:39:27 That dude could do literally anything and have it be successful.
01:39:33 Yeah.
01:39:34 Because it does not matter what it is or even like the quality of it, it's just PewDiePie.
01:39:41 That's all that matters.
01:39:42 But how did he get that big?
01:39:44 Well, he was a video game, let's play, almost exclusively for a really long time.
01:39:48 Then he started vlogging, started to branch out.
01:39:50 But that kernel of him like developing that one skill of him,
01:39:54 him being in front of the camera and that of him playing video games,
01:39:58 he doesn't even like really do that much video game content as far as I know now.
01:40:03 It's just, he built up with that and then branched out into further things.
01:40:06 But I feel like with you and me, other people in the PCP and just, I mean, a lot of people at
01:40:10 large just are starting with, hey guys, it's me, you're supporting me, do, you know, whatever.
01:40:16 And I don't think people like want that.
01:40:18 I don't want, I don't think people want to like just run off the bat.
01:40:22 Like just now have to follow this random dude who does all these disparate random things.
01:40:27 I feel like our audience will disagree with that because that's what they do.
01:40:31 But I think they're like, you guys are the minority, you know.
01:40:36 Yeah.
01:40:37 People want people to be comic machines or want them to be video machines or want them to be
01:40:41 let's play machines.
01:40:42 They don't want them to be like, for instance, rapping all the way back to endless war,
01:40:48 first year SL version, happy birthday, ah.
01:40:51 Oh, right.
01:40:51 Oh, right.
01:40:52 Happy birthday.
01:40:53 Happy birthday, endless war, up all the way.
01:40:56 I would go up and give him a present.
01:40:58 But I'm afraid he would shoot his eye laser beam at me.
01:41:01 Yeah, that's the fable ultimate beam.
01:41:04 Mm hmm.
01:41:06 Like this is just not like this RCK.
01:41:11 Like this is an unwieldy mess.
01:41:15 No one wants to play this.
01:41:17 And I understand.
01:41:19 It makes sense.
01:41:20 I don't think the way we run.
01:41:22 I mean, the show is called Rowdy fuckers cop killers.
01:41:26 And I think like I thought about like there are ways we can better monetize it.
01:41:31 And there are ways that we can do that without changing the soul of the show.
01:41:33 But but honestly, like I don't care because I don't want to change RCK in any way that
01:41:39 would lessen it's it's it's like part of the appeal of RCK is the fact that it's very that
01:41:46 it's weird that it's unlike anything else in this war.
01:41:50 Just in concept, this this like the idea on its own of being a text based MMO in a discord
01:41:56 server they can play for three years for free using the link in the description on its own is
01:42:01 crazy.
01:42:01 But the fact that it is tied into this fucking weird avant-garde.
01:42:05 Let's play show is just is a whole nother layer.
01:42:10 It is.
01:42:10 So yeah.
01:42:11 And that's great.
01:42:13 And that's why and that's why it's cool.
01:42:17 And that's why I am you know fucking and that's why I'm a fucking nothing master.
01:42:26 What's the word?
01:42:27 A wasteoid.
01:42:28 Waste wasteoid.
01:42:29 Webazoid.
01:42:32 Go nowhere.
01:42:33 Fucking idiot.
01:42:36 It doesn't have a fucking real art job.
01:42:38 It was just it was just yeah yeah yeah great.
01:42:43 Sorry.
01:42:43 That was kind of that probably sounded kind of spiteful of me.
01:42:48 But like I do think that it is part of like it is an outgrowth of a kind of attitude that I have had
01:42:55 where like I don't care about I don't care about the monetizability of X idea.
01:43:00 I just care about the fact that I think it's interesting and I want to do it
01:43:04 and I'll make something that's not like anything else.
01:43:06 Doesn't appeal to a wide audience.
01:43:08 I don't care.
01:43:09 And um I don't know.
01:43:13 Is that was that a good idea.
01:43:15 I don't know.
01:43:16 Yeah.
01:43:17 I don't know.
01:43:19 I I don't like maybe maybe maybe munchie.
01:43:23 Maybe if I'd made some more maybe if I'd made a web comic about I don't know a little fucking it's
01:43:33 like you know it's like a dark it's like a dark modern take on like Little Red Riding Hood.
01:43:39 But it's like you know kind of like it's kind of creepy but it's cute like it's a cute creepy
01:43:43 kind of like you know it's like a little you know she meets like friends along the way it's
01:43:47 like a fantastical thing you know get that up on Hiveworks or whatever you know chugged away at
01:43:53 that and nothing else for like three years.
01:43:55 Maybe by now maybe by now I'd have like a low level like storyboarding job at like
01:44:01 you know the hub or something you know.
01:44:04 Well well I get what you're saying but I think you're even overthinking.
01:44:08 I think just take what you're doing now.
01:44:10 I mean it's just unpolished is the thing if you just spent more time working on the comics
01:44:15 that you'd already made if you just really tried to iron them out more than than you put them out.
01:44:19 Here's the thing.
01:44:20 I feel like there'd be way more successful you know.
01:44:22 Here's the thing.
01:44:24 I don't think I agree with you.
01:44:26 And maybe yeah maybe this is ego talking.
01:44:30 I don't think I need to get any better.
01:44:36 Like I don't think I need to.
01:44:37 Wait Ben you are aware that I was making a joke.
01:44:41 Wait what?
01:44:41 That I was saying you had to make the comics perfect.
01:44:46 Oh sorry.
01:44:47 That was obviously bad advice.
01:44:50 You're like I hear what you're saying.
01:44:51 I understand what you're trying to say.
01:44:53 Oh okay yeah you know what I was um that's that's me just that's just the tism.
01:44:59 That's just the tism talking.
01:45:02 Yeah um.
01:45:04 Continue what were you saying.
01:45:05 Anyway I was just saying like well I mean now my I was objecting to a
01:45:10 complaint that you didn't actually make sincerely so.
01:45:14 Cool.
01:45:15 I mean there's like I don't yeah I don't I don't know.
01:45:20 Say maybe maybe maybe if things you know maybe it could fucking maybe it could be like
01:45:26 have built up more of an audience have some fucking storyboarding job at some
01:45:31 animation studio or something uh probably be a lot more it would probably get me more ahead
01:45:37 like in societally wise uh I mean I think I think I have all it's a frustrating because I think
01:45:44 I have all the skills like I think I could easily do something like that that would make me like
01:45:49 much better known much more of like a you know an industry guy like much better connected
01:45:55 much more successful generally um so I'm simultaneously frustrated but that didn't
01:46:03 happen but also I don't even know if I want that anyway I feel both negative emotions
01:46:09 at the same time for conflicting reasons that contradict one another.
01:46:14 We went into productivity as an idea last episode pretty significantly that was a
01:46:20 it was a pretty big section of the episode and I feel it like related to this and and and sort of
01:46:27 like picking what your what what you want to do with your life I feel like having clarity
01:46:34 on issues is something really big that one can easily lose sight of when they're freelancing
01:46:40 and they have so many options before them and it can feel I think we've talked about this before
01:46:45 me and you but like it can feel like you're doing so much stuff but like you aren't you aren't actually
01:46:54 doing that much when you when you sit down and actually analyze what you're doing it can seem
01:47:02 almost like you aren't doing anything in a way uh it just feels like when things are undefined
01:47:08 they feel more uh what's the word they they feel more oppressive than they are actually
01:47:15 when you have vaguely defined work it can sort of feel uh like there's so much of it when in
01:47:20 fact it's it's not that it's a lot of it it's just that you don't really know what you're
01:47:24 supposed to be doing exactly at a good moment and the reason I bring this up is because I feel like
01:47:29 when we have varied works like we do now uh me and you we have so many different things that we
01:47:36 could be working on we could be working on in the store we could be working on quick drive
01:47:38 can be working on the pcp we could be working on our own individual stuff you have like a thousand
01:47:42 different things you could do and it that can be very paralyzing that can be very very like well
01:47:50 and the thing about me is that I'm prone to paralysis yeah it's just realable palsy yeah I'm
01:47:56 I'm serious I'm heavily prone to to paralysis and stuff I completely understand yeah I I uh
01:48:06 there's been some developments in my life and I've sat down and I've tried to cut as many
01:48:12 things from my life as humanly possible and I've sat down and thought myself what are the things
01:48:18 I care about doing online I just went I just went through and thought that the things that I want
01:48:24 to do with my time what do I want to do with my time and I've come back with a very simple
01:48:29 short list rck endless war quick draw the pcp and personal art like commissions and stuff like
01:48:38 that those are the things I care about doing and before it was sort of like yeah I mean obviously
01:48:45 right like those the biggest things in my life it's not like I have another project that's running
01:48:50 but even just the the the sort of vague like should I be making a new podcast series right now
01:48:56 should I not be just even like the the the the vagueness even in an abstract uh like potential
01:49:04 way of like maybe I should be doing something more was causing me to to have paralysis in a way
01:49:10 work paralysis and I also cut down stuff like discord servers and I've tried to leave as much
01:49:17 as I can and just try to I haven't been spending a lot I haven't spending a lot less time on
01:49:21 discord lately yeah uh I uh I haven't been on social media long since I've deleted all that
01:49:27 to my friend I'm just trying to listen your brain is always gonna want to do stupid shit your brain
01:49:34 is always going to want to uh do stuff that's easiest and that requires a little amount of work
01:49:40 so you have to construct the world around you to be make it impossible you can't okay you know
01:49:46 you have twitter on your phone you say yourself I will go on twitter um I just won't go on twitter
01:49:52 anymore uh you're retarded that won't ever happen you need to have actual systems in a place to
01:50:00 incentivize that behavior because if you're not changing the system then why would you think that
01:50:06 you would get a different result you need to either you know like delete it outright which is what I
01:50:13 did or at least come up with like a different like like come up with different ways that your brain
01:50:19 wants to interact with twitter maybe do it at a specific time when you've deemed it's valuable
01:50:23 or just you know like you can't just say things will be different that's not self-control that's
01:50:29 cowardice and retardation yes my two favorite things
01:50:33 so I found it very very eye-opening and helpful to just sort of like define what I want to do with
01:50:46 my with my work and be able to think you know there's not actually that much to do you know
01:50:52 there's only a few projects I want to work on that's not that bad maybe I'll work on quick
01:50:56 try today well maybe I'll work in rck today I mean it's part it's part of the reason I haven't been
01:51:00 as active in in rfck is because like you know I I mean I don't want to talk I've said this a lot
01:51:08 before but like you know I realized like I really had this fucking vapor's three thing hanging over
01:51:12 my head for a long time time to fucking time to fucking put things aside and deal with that
01:51:17 just for my own sanity's sake I'm interested I'm interested at the same thing that I've done
01:51:23 would benefit you in a way because again you have a thousand you have a thousand different
01:51:28 things you could be doing is there any is there any ones that you think that you should be spending
01:51:33 more time on are there any like you think you would benefit from like removing some of the gunk
01:51:39 from your mind and just trying to streamline the process of okay I'm going to re-evaluate
01:51:44 what I'm doing I'm only going to be working on these this this and this do you think that would
01:51:48 be helpful for you well it already has been oh oh have have you done that or what what ones
01:51:57 was it just vapor's three that you're yeah that's the only that's the only thing I'm focusing on
01:52:02 these days um which is the right thing to do and I should have done it a lot sooner
01:52:10 and I think it's this way it'll be and I think do I have a sketchbook no a schedule like not
01:52:15 and I don't mean the sense that you uh regiment every single hour of your day I just mean uh do you
01:52:20 have like do you have a bedtime do you have a wake up time no I've taken it was been very very
01:52:29 motivating in this way uh that he's sort of uh made me think he he too has a bedtime and uh I
01:52:36 thought it was very appealing and I've finally actually done it uh I've got I've given myself
01:52:40 a bedtime which I'm sadly going to be breaking to record this show but you know it's the break
01:52:44 yeah rules are meant to be broken exactly but I've actually uh it feels weird to wake up
01:52:51 in the morning yeah it feels very unnatural for me but uh also very good because it feels like
01:52:57 oh my god it's two o'clock and I've been awake for like an hour already oh my god yeah yeah yeah
01:53:05 yeah I know I know that feeling the feeling of like I got up early my day feels so much longer
01:53:09 but the possibilities are endless um yeah yeah yeah I mean okay now this might not be the best
01:53:17 but it's been working well enough uh I have no bedtime I have no schedule or anything I have
01:53:26 just kind of been like I'm just gonna stay up until the next page is done and I'm just not going to
01:53:33 sleep until it is I mean I don't always get a whole page done in the day or anything it's I've
01:53:39 been getting maybe like one every two or three days lately um but you know they are getting done
01:53:46 under that system so give me give me an overview of the of a day in the life I've been saying
01:53:52 like well like well like what's what's the overview look like uh you you wake up do you
01:53:58 immediately just like get on your computer and start drawing or yeah well I'll get on my computer
01:54:05 and I'll either start drawing or I'll like I don't know play some Gungeon or something okay um and
01:54:12 it's pretty much I mean it's pretty much just alternating I mean it's pretty much just alternating
01:54:18 between like playing Gungeon or whatever game du jour uh you know looking at like social media
01:54:26 stuff and and drawing and like I just I get bored of one and I switch to the other and the cycle
01:54:32 repeats forever until until you collapse or until you get a page and you're finally allowing
01:54:39 yourself to sleep yes that's right that's that's it that's it that's pretty much it's all there is
01:54:45 to it do you feel like social media do you feel like social media impact like is bad at all because
01:54:53 I doubt it I don't I don't actually spend that much time um on social media really I mean I'll
01:55:00 like I'll scroll through my Twitter for you maybe like once or twice a day uh oh it's
01:55:06 funny huge I mean well I used to I used to be on discord more and I would spend more time you know
01:55:12 scrolling through that um not as much anymore that that discord was more of a time sink than
01:55:20 like Twitter was by far yeah uh it feels so good I I I can now see every server I'm in just like I
01:55:30 don't have to scroll I can't scroll anymore I still have to scroll but I just have tons and
01:55:34 tons of notifications that I'll never read Jesus yeah there's so much like you rck is terrible
01:55:42 that side servers yeah there's just so much shit you have to be in yeah yeah there is there's some
01:55:50 stuff that like you want to be in not even just rck but just in general I mean I'd like to in a
01:55:56 perfect world I'd be in everything sure but like it's like there's a lot of the servers where it's
01:56:02 like yeah I wish I posted there but like I'm not going to realistically and it even being here is
01:56:10 just another decision that I'll have to make to go in there or not to go in there and just another
01:56:16 like again going back to streamlining just another thing that could possibly lead me to just having
01:56:21 the choice overload just like literally like like there is I think a noticeable difference or like
01:56:31 like impact on your life just even just having one more choice like a discord server I think it
01:56:37 makes a genuine impact on your life to have clutter in the form of like your room is messy
01:56:43 or like your your discord things are messy and it can just feel like uh again there's just so much
01:56:50 to do uh you aren't uh you aren't fully dedicated to even just a few tasks you can just feel like
01:56:57 you're you're if your room is messy your life is messy it's my motto well my room's a fucking
01:57:03 disaster so yeah mine too lol well um well I don't know I'm thinking about cleaning my room
01:57:12 lately uh probably could do that um I'm cooking I've been cooking a bunch
01:57:19 ooh have you that's very human cordy bin that's a that's a that's a betrayal of your character
01:57:24 I don't know I don't know if it is uh well maybe a little bit um I mean my cooking generally is
01:57:31 about being as efficient as possible um it's about you know getting getting the right macromutrients
01:57:39 um you know fat specifically doing that doing me and Arlo you know doing our keto thing yeah yeah
01:57:46 two together me and Arlo should go on a keto day oh dude bins oh well now that's a guy who won't
01:57:53 let you down you you say collaborating with people is always a nightmare collaborate with Arlo and
01:57:57 do the keto podcast and you'll be fine oh you can come with some pun for keto kermit or something
01:58:04 that effect the the only the only show dedicated to puppets and being keto keto kermit yeah yeah
01:58:12 yeah I mean that's a very niche audience but I think it's one that's been crying out yeah well yeah
01:58:18 it's it's um it's um like like the the silent majority you know yeah totally um okay I'm probably
01:58:28 going to die to this mimic I'm really fucking up I think they're still not killed or the rat I've
01:58:34 only gotten to him once um come on Ben oh and I yep I died I died to the mimic okay yeah it's hard
01:58:42 it's hard it's a lot harder to play when you're talking but that's fine um okay what was I gonna
01:58:49 say oh yeah I make uh I I undertook a project the other day and I made a cauliflower crust pizza
01:58:58 and it came out pretty good um yeah but it took forever okay the real problem was that I don't
01:59:08 have a food processor all I have is a blender and it was a nightmare blending the cauliflower into
01:59:15 like like ricing it in a blender I I don't think I will even though the results were good and I was
01:59:21 pleased with them and it was a great pizza um I won't do it again because I without a food processor
01:59:29 it is a it is a nightmare yeah like blending it's it's just not made it's it's just not made to do it um
01:59:39 sad sad I I've been dying to cook again but my kitchen for like two months since before I left
01:59:48 the last like to go to Boston last trip and since I've gone back my kitchen has been
01:59:52 fucked and like it like it is it's there was mold found during a dishwasher and some sort of
01:59:59 inspection and now that we just haven't had any stove the only thing in the kitchen that's worked
02:00:03 is our fridge and it's just been a complete like uh construction wasteland for literal months
02:00:10 and I haven't been to cook and I've just had I've just had to eat fucking Chipotle every day
02:00:14 oh what a nightmare I know it is it literally is what a disaster um let's get those keto bowls
02:00:21 let's get those lifestyle bowls no no no no no I listen I'm overloaded on ketones as it is if I
02:00:28 have any more than I might brist that's the life that is the life god I just want to swap keto
02:00:35 notes with Arlo that's a that's a that's a perfect day for me I don't know if I told you but you uh
02:00:42 you've you've you've scored a victory uh a long time ago actually uh I haven't I even I've canceled
02:00:49 my hello fresh a long long time ago even before my kitchen broke oh was that why because of me
02:00:55 no not because of you of course not yeah I don't want to any of your advice
02:00:59 sure uh why it's it's it's because I I've outgrown it I know how to cook on my own I don't need
02:01:04 anymore it's like I've always said it's it's it's a beginner's it's a crutch from when you first
02:01:08 started out okay well fair enough all right well good um that's good then I guess you got something
02:01:15 out of it I did uh but unfortunately I didn't get enough out of it because my fucking kitchen's broken
02:01:20 god damn it you know a real man can cook without a kitchen real man just lights a fire in the back
02:01:27 yeah it's room yeah it's a room yeah real man just uh a real man just uh just burns like a fire in
02:01:34 his trash can and just like roasts roast hot dogs over him man god you know hello fresh might be
02:01:41 too human core for me but instacart is the best uh instacart I just I don't I don't gotta go shopping
02:01:49 I feel like one like 90 bucks 90 bucks one time for a whole year of like I never have to go shopping
02:01:56 it is that's pretty good it's so good do I feel bad because uh for the poor people that have to
02:02:05 like actually deliver the groceries for what I can only assume is a complete shithole gig economy
02:02:11 style job with no benefits and probably just getting just exploited the fuck right out yep
02:02:18 but you know what it's not my problem
02:02:23 open oh oh oh uh open I mean it's not like if I I mean it's not like if I didn't do it
02:02:30 it's not like if I didn't engage in this hideous system known as capitalism that these people
02:02:36 would be better off because they don't have me getting them to go out and buy my fucking groceries
02:02:41 for me thanks um so whatever don't even worry about it just don't even worry about it just close
02:02:48 your eyes just don't think about it they love it they want it I'll give it to them free
02:02:56 I mentioned earlier uh I was asking you about about if the seasons impact your life and those
02:03:02 is very very very specific reason they ask this because this summer you're shaping up to be another
02:03:08 year or a summer of pain as it was last time you mentioned this yeah you said that I'm not too
02:03:13 on a recent pcp you said this was going to be another summer of pain uh and uh it's it's fully
02:03:19 locked in that I'm going to be traveling all over the place and I just came back from a trip up to
02:03:24 la now trips at the la for me are not anything particularly special in it other than the selves
02:03:30 uh it's you know I go up to la somewhat regularly but for this was for a um very special purpose
02:03:36 you see as I alluded to uh before um talking about code for boston uh I was I was given an
02:03:42 opportunity where I thought if I can somehow finagle if I can get some some people with social
02:03:48 clout to play in this war then uh then all would just be fucking golden uh and and this the opportunity
02:03:54 came to me in the form my mother asked me to attend a world premiere of a independent movie in
02:04:02 los angeles and to my honesty I don't really know why I thought I was gonna be able to talk to anyone
02:04:07 who would want to play in this war but to me the calculation was simply people in one place
02:04:14 they like movies so they might be nerds maybe I can somehow talk to someone uh who would uh
02:04:20 just like be like hey it's me I'm a big I'm a higher up at EA and I'm attending this la uh yeah
02:04:27 this this uh you know this this event and then I can be like well well mr EA I tune a video game
02:04:33 and would you for a chance want to play me for an afternoon or two and hopefully he would say yes
02:04:40 but anyway you know he's not fucking yes yeah yeah you yeah listen EA I feel like our business model
02:04:46 is very similar to what EA would have demanded of us you know it's completely ringing our audience
02:04:50 cash in this war is the most profitable thing we've done in our entire lives
02:04:56 and I wouldn't have it any other way uh as soon as that bottom line as soon as the bottom line
02:05:01 falls out of endless war it's canceled um yeah I I uh I so so I go up there and it's a fucking
02:05:12 arduous four-hour drive as it always is because LA is shit traffic um so I know by the way LA is
02:05:17 like the worst city on earth like no one lives in LA I'm just convinced that it's like a joke or
02:05:24 perhaps I'm sort of like prank people come out and like like say that they got me after a while
02:05:30 you approach LA there are no roads there are only highways there's no like you know you get in there
02:05:37 there's some surface streets but it's all just they all just lead in highways you approach the city
02:05:42 there's just a bunch of drab gray buildings in the distance they're just sucking life out of you
02:05:47 sucking all the color out of life as you approach them there are no lights on you pass by apartment
02:05:52 after apartment there are no people in those apartments they're just they're just out there's
02:05:56 some sort of like building quota they have to keep up so it's like it's like the town of city
02:06:00 yeah exactly um it's it's like that one north korean city i'm a dmz that there's no one in but
02:06:06 they just want to make it seem like there are people there so the so people in south korea will
02:06:09 affect and that there's actual people living in north korea uh it's complete far since i've
02:06:14 been real is that a real thing that sounds like a real thing you just it is a real thing yeah it is
02:06:18 okay yeah excellent uh it's a fucking nightmare and i hate LA uh but that's that's that's my impression
02:06:26 of you but opposite uh got him so so we're inviting this premiere my my friends are my mom's friend
02:06:36 my gay friend not relevant to the story it's like that would be nice dude yeah that's really
02:06:42 normalizing it um we go to the chinese theater i will speak of gay people i just want to once again
02:06:49 say public enemy number one in new los angeles city pete budigich who has declared that went if he
02:06:56 gets elected president yeah he will wants to put a stop to endless war we can't fucking have it
02:07:01 we can't he can't believe that someone had the audacity to say that oh actually bernie said
02:07:04 something similar i saw it really well kind of he me i just saw him on twitter um like yesterday i
02:07:11 was looking at twitter as i sometimes do and one of his he said uh i think his phrasing was like
02:07:17 we spend too much money on endless wars oh and that was very offensive to me um well hey funny
02:07:26 funny thing i'm going to a yang rally really you are you are on the tenth yeah i'm going to so
02:07:32 the day after you viewer hear this fucking follow me on twitter it's also ugly maybe i'll

02:07:42 it's gonna be really boring you're gonna wonder why you went yeah i'm i'm prepared for that um
02:07:50 speaking of that burning rally by the way some follow-up on that um while i was in line they were

02:09:45 this isn't why i came to the bernie rally yeah this is not what i signed up for even though it's
02:09:51 literally why i signed up that's what you get that's what you get for getting involved in your
02:09:54 community fucking idiot it is it's literally disincentivizing it's literally like i won't go to

02:10:38 there's stuff like did you see our it was do you see my last text there's also like hey anthony
02:10:43 it's me samuel so it might be like a dude it might not it's probably not it's probably a bot

02:11:10 gang or other women oh god i'm not the dunning kruger what's the fuck what's the test in blade

02:11:33 you come across a picture of a naked girl mr. deckerd are you asked are you is this to

02:11:46 whatever sorry okay sorry to sorry to turn this into a blade i don't even care about
02:11:50 blade runner i don't want to make this a blade runner cast okay uh what were you talking about
02:11:54 don't care what uh are you rally shit gunjan uh i'm doing decent this round uh but i'm low on
02:12:02 heart so i might die um my weapons are pretty oh i was i was saying that i was going up to a
02:12:07 film premiere to this shit fucking movie okay right yeah yeah was there more to that yeah oh
02:12:14 ben okay i haven't even started with this movie uh i know so we go to the chinese theater ground
02:12:22 chinese theater sure little in fact the theming of it being a chinese theater stop starts and stops
02:12:27 at the entrance yeah it just it looks like a mall i'm the inside yeah uh it sounds about right
02:12:34 uh a nightmare uh we go and we get our seats uh the the the the attendant at the start says uh
02:12:41 if you gotta go back and go to the bathroom now uh it's a long movie and uh i listened but i thought
02:12:47 how long can this movie be really long yeah really really really really really really long
02:12:53 how long uh it is often said by by me even uh me especially i often describe things as nightmares
02:13:02 yes and and well that's you know it's easy to do they pick that up from you who picked that up from
02:13:08 did i say that too i i i i think maybe you from me i don't know doesn't matter okay anyway it's
02:13:16 a very common thing to say i guess and i'm tempted to say that but i would describe it more in a
02:13:21 literal sense it wasn't a nightmare and since it was bad like overly bad even though it was it was a
02:13:27 it was dreamlike in a lot of ways you know how dreams have quote unquote stories but it's just
02:13:37 sort of one long continuous your brain is constantly coming up scene after scene after scene
02:13:42 there's no beginning middle or end it's just one like like like it just is continuously going along
02:13:49 it's almost like an improv comic in a way yeah it just is just it's just continuously developing
02:13:54 in weird haphazard ways that don't connect to with one another and just seemingly endlessly until
02:14:00 you wake up and you wake up in a cold sweat that's what this movie is like genuine it's
02:14:05 wait so the movie was like yeah this is what the movie was okay i wasn't sure if you were
02:14:09 describing the movie or your experience of going to this theater no no the the movie itself though
02:14:15 i guess it could be said for the overall experience for going to the theater because in itself it was
02:14:19 a nightmare but i'm going to uh i'm going to uh say the the movie title was the turnover and it's
02:14:27 on imdb right now you can go you can go to turnover is it about is it about the pastry indeed um well
02:14:36 it's sort about the pastry oh what you have to understand is that okay this is a it says on
02:14:44 here that it is uh two hours uh it felt like it was way longer so i like to the point where like i
02:14:51 don't believe that this could possibly be true like it can be like oh well i just thought the
02:14:57 movie was really long but it's so it felt so long to the fact that like i like there's no way it was
02:15:03 two hours that feels like it's impossible with the amount of time that i was there watching it that
02:15:09 you just there's no way that you possibly compute but um even though it is two hours which is long
02:15:15 on its own it felt like it was longer in the editing bay and it was cut down to be two hours
02:15:22 so there's so much that's like implied to have happened or to be a character trait
02:15:30 for instance i'll give you the part of the movie in a second here yeah but it's about a restaurant
02:15:35 owner and at one point the restaurant owner rebrands his restaurant and one of his employee he
02:15:41 renames it and he gives it a new logo and one of the characters the waitress um says i thought i
02:15:47 threw that design out implying a lot of things implying she's an artist implying she might have
02:15:53 you know she might be perfectionist in a way she might you know she might be down herself and might
02:15:56 not think that her good enough and and there might have been a scene where the restaurant owner
02:16:01 pete finds a design in the trash or something and it has a you know a moment where he's like
02:16:06 this this girl's too hard on herself i'm gonna i'm gonna make things right i'm gonna make sure
02:16:10 she knows that she's cool um literally not mentioned once the woman is an artist never
02:16:16 mentioned again not even like just so many things are just like implied to be you know
02:16:22 it's taken for great like yeah you know this girl draws i guess i guess that's something she does
02:16:27 this can be said for every character every plot point every just aspect of the story just like
02:16:34 things are supposed to be just you know you just get it like a dream there's no explanation for
02:16:39 things it's just like i guess this is how things are i guess this is just like what is happening
02:16:44 right now um sounds a little like the vapors honestly
02:16:50 ben why would you say that about yourself well i mean there's not a lot of like explanation
02:16:56 about stuff stuff it like vapors is just like a series of things that happen right that they're
02:17:02 all around a central idea okay maybe maybe i'm maybe i'm not maybe i'm not getting what you're
02:17:09 saying because it doesn't this doesn't sound like a bad thing that you're describing maybe it doesn't
02:17:16 sound like a bad thing in concept but it was a very confusing film in a lot of ways i just i don't
02:17:24 mean to imply that it just because it was a goon coonsverk and that everything didn't lead back to
02:17:28 a central theme it was bad or that because it was like a sort of sliced life in a way that that was
02:17:35 bad yeah it's it's that it felt like it didn't know what to like what it was or what it was trying to
02:17:43 accomplish on the surface of it it's like supposed to be like a character study in a way of the
02:17:48 restaurant owner pete but it's just you know i almost want to say that you just have to watch it
02:17:56 and you would understand what i'm trying to say sure and uh it's it's just you can't was it just
02:18:03 didn't accomplish anything it did not accomplish in making me like any of the characters having any
02:18:08 memorable dialogue it did not accomplish having even like the semblance of a storyline or the
02:18:15 semblance of stakes in any way that you just felt like sort of an arbitrary series of things that
02:18:22 happens exactly exactly where it's like it didn't feel like one led into the other it didn't feel
02:18:28 like it was uh progressing in any way the the vapor is like sure it doesn't have it like a story
02:18:34 per se but and well understand what's happening and damn it yeah okay so was it just like confusing
02:18:42 were you just confused what yeah that that is the afterwards that is the afterwards that it was just
02:18:46 confusing in in every way i didn't get what it was trying to do i didn't get what the characters
02:18:52 were trying to do uh i didn't understand the point of the fucking movie at all um to get into
02:18:59 more specifically i will read the indb cafe owner peter at least his disgruntled manager
02:19:04 henry to take care of business instead he hires a crew of misfits peter returns to an
02:19:09 unrecognizable business but soon learns of the value of camaraderie with his new team
02:19:14 it's about family it's about family literally literally it's about family okay he's sick yeah
02:19:21 i mean i love camaraderie personally maybe i'm maybe i'm this movie's target demographic
02:19:27 yeah you just don't care about family or camaraderie that's that's your problem
02:19:36 so what i'm going to describe the movie and you may think that doesn't sound that bad
02:19:40 yeah but keep in mind i am heavily condensing things because i don't want to be here for an hour
02:19:48 explaining each scene that just happens and there's no rhyme or reason for it and there's no
02:19:54 like it adds nothing to the structure of the film it just is like a plot point that just
02:19:59 you know just happens for no reason so the gist of the movie there's this old dude named peter
02:20:06 who owns a restaurant and a twink named henry who is who is his affiliate
02:20:13 partner in crime partner in crime i suppose in a way not incredibly well defined what's
02:20:21 going on there he's like the waiter and the chef and like the like everything else as well
02:20:26 he just like runs the entire business sure um and uh he's disgruntled for for because he doesn't
02:20:32 feel like his potential has been lived up to so he forces peter to make a uh a new franchise
02:20:39 yeah well and he is the manager of this is wait what kind of a restaurant is this that's like
02:20:44 a little cafe it's like a french restaurant it doesn't really matter okay um it uh and and and
02:20:51 so peter agrees by the way this entire movie wants to treat peter like he's an asshole and
02:20:59 peter's the main character right yeah peter's the main character he's the old dude yeah and they
02:21:03 want to like the entire movie like the conceit of the movie is that like it's a character
02:21:08 art he's a character study of peter and how he learns to accept his eventual crew of myths
02:21:13 fits for who they are yeah and it he wants to portray him as stubborn he's not portrayed that way
02:21:19 as all except for in dialogue where people are belittling him and berating him like saying like
02:21:25 don't be some stubborn peter yeah and he and he's like oh yeah i don't know like i'm sorry i guess
02:21:30 you're right sorry and okay oh shit oh fuck okay yeah i could see uh you can see how that would be
02:21:39 annoying that's just one of the many things where it's like yeah it's implied in dialogue to be the
02:21:44 case but it's it just isn't it just is not the case you're on team peter oh oh i'm white dude
02:21:53 i could not be more on team peter unfortunately it turns into a pussy later but that's you know
02:21:58 that's it you know sweet yes um then his evil ex-wife comes into frame his ex-wife is a frequent
02:22:09 character but each time she's a completely different person so for her first appearance
02:22:13 she is unbelievable like corolla de vil evil yeah um and comes in what did she do um okay i'm
02:22:22 going to get to it um but she also introduced like else in that scene is introduced my favorite
02:22:27 character in the show all right in the movie who is peter's son and peter son is played completely
02:22:34 straight like he's on the andy griffith show where he says to flake ah gee pops like can i
02:22:41 go to my friends huh can i can i completely isn't a child actor he's like 13 he's not even young
02:22:50 okay he he's like a teenager who is like pops i'm so happy to see you again i'm you know you
02:22:58 know dad you didn't talk like that when you were 13 um oh wait i knew you when you were
02:23:03 13 wait did i know did you did uh i think you knew me when i was 14 at least yeah yeah that's
02:23:10 what you were that's what you were like don't you remember oh gee whiz oh gee whiz did you golly
02:23:17 uh beautiful and it's like that in every single scene by the way this is one of the scenes that
02:23:23 don't matter and isn't uh you know like like um expanded upon it anyway so i'm just gonna mention
02:23:29 it here at one point he's rocking back and forth during a conversation with uh between peter and
02:23:34 his ex-wife um and he shot almost like a horror movie fourth and just cut between him rocking him
02:23:40 back and forth with a knife in his hands and them talking and then eventually he falls out of the
02:23:46 of the chair and stabs someone else on accident and then like that like peter just takes the guy to
02:23:52 the hospital and like that's the end of the scene like he's just fine no he's like he just like stabbed
02:23:59 someone and that's like not a plot point wait just stabs someone why does he just stab wait with
02:24:05 what i'm sorry i was i was see i'm being attacked by a beholder right now okay i understand um can
02:24:12 you can you repeat can you repeat some yeah yeah they're just in a restaurant they're in
02:24:16 peter's restaurant yeah uh peter and his ex-wife are talking his son's rocking back and forth in a
02:24:22 chair with a butter knife in his hand and i'm dead okay he falls out of the chair yeah and he stabs
02:24:28 a patron one of the staff with this butter knife he's bleeding and like that's like never brought
02:24:35 up it's just like he starts to bleed peter says i i take him to the hospital he takes him to the
02:24:40 hospital and like that he stabs him on purpose well not on purpose but it's a mishap and he says
02:24:46 oh gee i like i'm really sorry okay well so it's like oh wait i you haven't seen the room i was
02:24:53 going to compare it to the scenes did you know that in the room there are like not one but two
02:24:59 scenes where they're just tossing the old pigskin around and someone just falls on someone else
02:25:04 for no reason is is that the case yeah there's i think they're tossing the pigskin and but there's
02:25:11 a lot of pigskin tossing yeah is that the term they use as well i don't think so but they might as
02:25:19 well there's one where mark just like they're just they're just like laughing and then like he just
02:25:25 like from no reason just falls on another guy like just from a perfectly balanced standing
02:25:30 position yeah yeah yeah yeah um and there's another one too i don't remember when the second one
02:25:35 happens but there's at least two okay so okay so it's just a weird accident just it well let's
02:25:45 think about let's think critically did they just not have a was it just a way to end the scene
02:25:49 like did they just want to end the scene and didn't know why didn't didn't know how to do it okay it
02:25:56 in in okay i think it might okay okay the only thing i can think is that setting up the idea
02:26:03 that there's a hospital in the city for later oh good okay see that's world that's a way that's
02:26:11 world-building look it up sometime that's the only thing i can think because later the hospital is
02:26:16 relevant but completely unrelated to the incident and that is not important does he like meet a
02:26:22 character at the hospital when he goes to drop this knife no wound victim no okay okay um not no
02:26:31 not at all uh but anyway back back to the back to the chronological order see um evil wife demands
02:26:38 that this literal child is the manager of the new franchise for his restaurant instead of Henry
02:26:44 this literal 13 year old g whiz who's Henry Henry is the old manager yeah yeah he's the
02:26:49 tweak manager who's who's disgruntled and feels like he should be behind the booth instead of out
02:26:54 there and you know at mice like the proletariat yeah okay i'm with them i think i'm on team Henry
02:27:01 yeah everyone post in the comments are you are you hashtag team peter hashtag team Henry um don't
02:27:08 be don't be team pete because pete bootages wants to bring an end to endless war oh i can imagine i
02:27:14 think i think is i have no idea what his name is his name is something like something stupid like
02:27:19 like pete pastry or like pete pierre or something in the fact no his name is not pete pastry it can't
02:27:26 might as well be can't possibly might as well be pete pastry um and and and so that's like a name
02:27:33 that like jk rowling that's like a jk rowling name but like the laziest jk rowling character ever
02:27:42 um so okay the scene is like the the the start of the entire plot and here and the wife just says
02:27:51 like make Henry or i'm sorry don't make Henry the new manager make our son who's a literal baby
02:27:57 the manager and peter says no i mean why and then the scene ends uh also to emphasize how how evil
02:28:07 the x y face she says that she like he'll never see the sun again if he doesn't make the sun the
02:28:13 the man how how would that work which i don't know so and so this is obviously leading to like like
02:28:22 then you know the plot of the movie comes in and she there's like a custody battle or something
02:28:27 you know obviously no okay no no all right uh and so like pete just he is on vacation now i
02:28:37 don't want to emphasize the fact that he like it's not like pete says like oh i need to break from
02:28:40 this i'm on vacation now there's that scene i just described smash cut to him in a sailboat
02:28:47 looking at the sun gleefully smash cut back to the restaurant and like it's only revealed later
02:28:53 that he's on like vacation and for like an extended period of time he's been on vacation this whole
02:28:58 this whole time is what is what you're saying no no i'm saying that like he starts vacation
02:29:04 just not announced to the audience that what he's doing or for like a reason
02:29:10 really it's not like he's particularly in like hot water right now or he wants to get away
02:29:16 it's just like again like again it's just so confusing like he okay smash cut him in the in a
02:29:21 sailboat hey he's on vacation right now he could just be sailing i don't know why i would imagine
02:29:26 that he is now like off of work for like a week and a half like what is actually happening
02:29:32 or why i'm just expected to know that but anyway the ex-wife just tells henry that peter agreed
02:29:37 and so peter or i'm sorry now now henry takes it upon himself to hire a bunch of literally
02:29:44 mentally deficient people and minorities in order to make the restaurant go belly up in
02:29:49 order to spite peter that's the plot of the of the of the story is is henry just now is like
02:29:56 full just like like listen if i can't be kasey green i'll kill kasey green because my thoughts
02:30:02 exactly um yeah okay wait so this is like supposed to be like the actual like plot of the story
02:30:12 is like you know again it's a story about family it's a story about you know peter coming to
02:30:16 determine with this class of misfits that that henry hires this is like an hour into the movie
02:30:22 okay good yeah yeah yeah all right i'm with you he hires two what's the problem like like mentally
02:30:31 disabled people unironically yeah um an old lady just a girl who i guess is that yeah even the worst
02:30:39 of all yeah yeah yeah yeah and and a black guy and a mexican guy and like that's like that's like the
02:30:45 crew of misfits that he's acquired here that's the crew of like like it's it's what a what a color
02:30:50 what a colorful cast of characters i'm sorry you're not allowed to say colored anymore yeah um
02:30:56 just like like normal people basically yeah okay um by the way i'm not about to send you a picture
02:31:03 of of henry just like you know what he looks like um this is you in about uh 12 years ago
02:31:09 no yeah no all right i'll show it there it is yeah there's me there's me
02:31:21 he's super killer he's such he's such a killer yeah not enough killers wear cowboy hats
02:31:27 um we gotta do something about it so the next couple scenes are frankly indescribable
02:31:32 henry leaves the misfits in charge of the restaurant and like bad things happen question mark
02:31:40 yeah literally describe it i literally cannot describe like some people come to the cafe but it's
02:31:48 like oh by the way this entire movie is shot indoors it's there's never a scene of them outside
02:31:55 except for that aforementioned shot of the hint of peter outside sailing
02:31:59 literally not a single shot outside good wait yeah uh hmm i mean i want to clarify it's the same
02:32:12 building and the building is a small cafe so just feels like you're in the same place over and over
02:32:18 again every single scene as you are that's a nightmare did you die again no i didn't die
02:32:25 i just i fucked up and i don't have enough keys for the ugliet the ugliet is a side level
02:32:32 by the way i okay one in one ear out the other okay fine um you know what this might be i might
02:32:40 be able to make up the difference uh and you're fine and finally kill the rat like you've always
02:32:45 been destined to do i mean maybe that's the plan possible that's that's that's that's the plan
02:32:52 um all right i want to speed this up because i won't be talking about this movie forever
02:32:56 anyway there's just a bunch of scenes of the of the of the new crew just fucking up and being
02:33:01 stupid uh in ways that are confusing and ill-conceived and also not really well portrayed in the audience
02:33:07 peter comes back and is just like like upset that his restaurant has been turned upside down and like
02:33:14 it's been on the twist turned upside down yeah and none of these people have any experience in the
02:33:18 restaurant uh scene uh and this is treated as peter being unreasonable and everyone in the
02:33:24 all the crew is like for instance there's this one line that's delivered when peter comes in and
02:33:29 says like guys like what's going on here like you're supposed to be making french cuisine
02:33:35 and then one of the misfits says i'm sandal i'm i relate to him thus far
02:33:40 uh there's a lot you don't know about around here peter there's a lot you don't know about around
02:33:44 here it's his restaurant wait what yes yes he says you're supposed to be making french cuisine
02:33:50 and the response is there's a lot you don't know about around here yeah okay yeah yeah yeah yeah
02:33:59 so this gun so this gun that i'd have it um it just summons sharks from the ground
02:34:05 really yeah like it it's it shoots out a little like shark fin that sort of like floats along the
02:34:11 floor and then when it hits an enemy just a giant fucking jaws comes out and eats them
02:34:16 it's sick okay that's just i just want you to know what's going on for the audience i've literally
02:34:21 by the way viewers in case you couldn't tell i can literally cannot see bin screen he doesn't have
02:34:25 screen sure on and i don't care it like it's it's better this way fuck i miss the key fuck i miss
02:34:30 the key god damn it okay uh yeah this is the way it should be this is the way it should have always
02:34:35 been uh anyway there's there's like an arc where pier has to learn to accept this new cast even though
02:34:40 the new crew like can't do anything right according to the movie but we're supposed to
02:34:44 like them anyway and want them to succeed um and uh eventually uh his ex-wife shows up
02:34:50 now like a sweet woman who like is like reasonable did he like do something to like change your
02:34:58 attitude no no okay but but he's about to do something that could theoretically change her
02:35:04 but she's already like this before the scene yeah where uh peter uh wants to uh help his ex-wife
02:35:10 you know come to terms with it and you know show that he's moved on by inviting her and her new
02:35:15 fiance to a banquet at the uh the the now renamed eclectic cafe which is uh where i that's that's a
02:35:24 new sub-zone of the rye rough house eclectic cafe um of course this is uh of course uh
02:35:34 it's it's it's to honor all the different heritages that are at work in this in this incredible
02:35:39 cafe you understand and then it's like no everything's going to verse like oh because
02:35:43 there are a rowdy band of misfits and we gotta acknowledge that yeah yeah so they're eclectic
02:35:49 yeah eclectic cafe is it about pete learning not to be racist is that what you've done here
02:35:55 okay it's it's about shooting on pete for like two hours and then him being the exact same thing
02:36:01 and then uh everyone but like everyone likes him now cool yeah he's been through a lot yeah he has
02:36:07 been he believe me he's been through a lot he's been a lot more a lot more than you fucking idiot
02:36:12 um so well they throw a banquet the the uh uh uh the new fiance is there uh he he's italian so
02:36:21 that's how you know he's evil his ex-wife's new fiance yes yes yes yes why why is he
02:36:27 invited why is he invited why is she invited i don't get it well the peter's throwing it for them
02:36:33 to show there's no there's no ill will he's throwing it for them that's like a like a wedding reception
02:36:37 thing oh god it's like that song it's like that song about when the guy he's trying to call
02:36:44 his like ex-girlfriends and like her new boyfriend or whatever to like you know just a show there's
02:36:51 a show i will become the blow learn to take it well i only wish my words could just convince
02:36:58 myself that it just wasn't real but that's not the way it feels good song anyway go on i'm gonna
02:37:05 have to hit the road it's by peepootage it's a big hit by peepootage in a past life
02:37:13 uh i you know i i bet the reason he hates in this war so much is because when he first rode
02:37:17 into town in the scorch home to find some nematodes over in toxington he never found one he just
02:37:21 got cancer instead yeah you know tails all this time um okay okay so while at this banquet the
02:37:29 fiat the the the wife's new fiance go like rance about how like the the restaurant uh crew is just
02:37:35 like a bunch of like weird freaks about how he hates them for being different no no it was henry
02:37:40 that made him higher than new guys yes oh henry's just out of the movie henry's just out of the
02:37:44 movie he's just not even here why what happened what did she do to him what has she done with henry
02:37:50 uh henry's just like like after he screws up everything he's just gone for the rest of the
02:37:55 movie okay well that makes sense i guess and and uh you know i guess he just got gunned down
02:38:02 somewhere like maybe maybe in glocksbury and he hasn't responded he's just stay dead now
02:38:05 yeah um you know after after trying to raid killer uh ready territory anyway there's a fist
02:38:10 fight and a food fight at the scene and uh peter just starts beating up the fiance and they start
02:38:17 throwing blows and everyone's just throwing food at one another goes to shit and then peter has a
02:38:22 stroke and a heart attack and then they go and this is what the the final act of the movie is like
02:38:27 i thought this this quirky food fight was gonna be like the end of it and like peter has grown
02:38:31 up and he's like learned to stand up is the new fiance like younger than him yeah okay is the
02:38:38 wife his age or is the wife younger or what the wife is hmm hey you there why now i'm here
02:38:45 okay sorry you cut out you cut out but you're back okay cool yeah um and then peter has a stroke
02:38:51 and this is like the rest of the movie is what it's about it's like it's completely shipped away
02:38:55 from it being like about learning to accept people who are different it just is like help peter not
02:39:00 be like mentally disabled anymore like help him recover from his stroke really and then yes i'm
02:39:06 not joking and then the most emblematic scene of the entire movie takes place imagine this imagine
02:39:13 a scene in the reception like the you know a a a um uh inside a hospital talking to the receptionist
02:39:23 uh and the misfits want to see peter they want to you know they he was taken by him i mean who
02:39:28 wouldn't after after all they've been through together of course so it's it's it's the scene
02:39:33 that keeps getting cut back between the mexican chef this gun is so fucking good i can't believe it
02:39:39 yeah demanding to see him the where the receptionist saying we don't have him on file the mexican chef
02:39:46 just saying find him his name is peter cutting in between that and the waitress uh millennial
02:39:53 goth girl nice talking to her mother who is a nurse and saying the following which has not
02:40:00 been established whatsoever the the the goth girl meets her mom says mom i have a job now the mom

02:42:33 apparently yeah and then it's immediately resolved and there's no point to it i don't understand what's
02:42:38 happening movie why they just never brought it up before but then they just have a totally
02:42:43 unearned emotional scene where she confronts and gets over her mother buying her sperm from a sperm
02:42:51 donor yeah do i have do i have the do i have the right the idea yeah okay cool i was probably
02:42:58 really buoyed for everyone in the audience for me to repeat that but i'm still not over this
02:43:02 like this was like like three weeks ago yeah still thinking about well hey you know
02:43:08 the movie made an impression so maybe it's actually a masterpiece you know what you're right yeah i know
02:43:15 you know i i i would recommend if you are able to do so watch this movie don't watch the entire thing
02:43:21 because i'm not advocating suicide but i am advocating that you at least understand what i'm
02:43:26 saying because i guarantee you if you watch this then you will uh you'll understand what i am uh
02:43:32 you'll know your pain you'll know my pain yeah you'll know my pain it's as i said i went to like
02:43:38 the premiere so uh it's gonna be a a while before this thing is even on dvds it's gonna be a while
02:43:43 but this this is going on the rck museum it's going the rck uh animals of history and uh i'll
02:43:50 let you know about updates to the turnover i went to a movie premiere at mit a few years ago
02:43:57 i don't remember what the movie was i don't remember like anything about it might have
02:44:02 been a documentary i can't remember but i think i remember that like the xkcd guy was there and he
02:44:09 like gave like there was like a q and a with him it was like him and the directors i don't know what
02:44:14 the i don't know what was up with this i don't know why this event happened or what if anything the xkcd
02:44:20 guy had to do with it um but that's the true oh my god the black hole gun i got the black hole gun
02:44:28 and i don't know what it does but i'm gonna find out probably choose a black hole i had to give up
02:44:33 all right i gave up my key i probably won't be able to get to the ooble at this round but that's
02:44:38 okay i'm gonna try without it it's worth it for the black hole gun i should mention by the way
02:44:44 i started out with the saying that i wanted to rub shoulders to people in uh in in LA yeah immediately
02:44:48 after the movie was over uh everyone who worked on the movie uh uh like just like left like they
02:44:54 all just like like stood up and then all went like to like every like a party that only they were
02:45:00 invited to well literally we just rolled up to watch the movie which was a nightmare and then
02:45:06 drive home and that was it i didn't get to talk to someone at EA at all i didn't see you didn't
02:45:11 you didn't even see um cliff blizinski yeah he didn't even make an appearance
02:45:18 sad if there's i i wanted people who worked on turnover so badly to play in the swore i wanted
02:45:23 i just wanted it more than anything and it didn't work it didn't work man i'm sorry bra maybe next
02:45:29 time maybe next movie premiere you can meet those EA execs yeah yeah well don't worry this is not
02:45:34 this is not dissuaded me from going to every single movie premiere that i can go to possibly to
02:45:39 get the the word in there oh no the black hole ate my key god damn it i'm sorry i haven't you're
02:45:46 not having any luck the black hole ate my key i'm uh livid i'm just livid i need i said i needed
02:45:57 okay how am i gonna fucking kill the rowdy route without a key you can't do it don't tell me you
02:46:01 can do it how like like how hard is it to find the right right because it feels like we've been
02:46:06 going for like a billion years i found him i found it once i found yeah i found what finding him is
02:46:11 not hard um i don't know i just you know i'm not fully focused on the game so i'm taking some bad
02:46:16 damage here um i'm i'm gonna i've tried i tried to find him so i can visualize him is it is his
02:46:21 canonical name the resourceful rat it is the resourceful rat but he's pretty rowdy he's definitely
02:46:27 rowdy he's definitely rowdy you know what okay i'm gonna restart i'm gonna take this really seriously
02:46:33 i'm gonna do it really seriously um because i just true this i just been fucking around i just
02:46:38 viewer i just been wasting your time this whole time you know what don't worry about it um and
02:46:44 that's the end that's the end of my story hey hold on speaking of people yeah i've tried to
02:46:48 chill myself dude did i tell you about that dude on reddit that i do know catfish on behalf of the
02:46:56 pcp to try and get some uh social cloud no um for i think i've talked about this before that i was
02:47:04 going on reddit a lot more to try and uh to recapture some of uh uh the old tumblr days
02:47:09 the tumblr is dead i broke uh and i was on oh there's another one there's another water barrel
02:47:14 yes okay go on i was i was on r slash boston as i was just it was having fun and there was a reddit
02:47:21 post uh saying like hello like like like are there any uh podcasters or internet influencers
02:47:30 that operate the bot like any local boston podcast honestly that sets off red flags for me
02:47:36 yeah does it why well i mean my immediate thought is that this guy is may he's probably a
02:47:43 podcaster himself and he and he wants you know he wants to he wants he wants to get plugged
02:47:49 not on the gate not at all okay completely completely wrong ben uh for you see he was actually
02:47:55 an app developer who wanted us to uh to you see he i'm logging right now so i can get his full
02:48:02 conversation but anyway uh his post is local called local uh boston uh podcasters internet
02:48:09 influencers uh please DM me so we can work out a deal together and i think yes i'll do this on
02:48:15 i will take any deal yeah i love even though um they don't call me munchie day trump because i
02:48:21 don't like deals even though we aren't local to boston um i could have plausible deniability
02:48:27 there you know it's like you know it well it's not true that's totally no that's totally fair
02:48:35 that's totally fair yeah mm-hmm so i i i DM him and then started back and forth uh and uh so i'm
02:48:43 gonna get the first thing here uh uh boss okay okay so so first thing um i say like hey i'm part
02:48:51 of a local boston podcaster and um like need an analyzer group uh in the boston area and i'm i'm
02:49:00 interested in your app uh so please let me know you know you know you know he's developing an app
02:49:08 yeah he's developed he's part of an app development team or i mean what's the app
02:49:13 the app is first question okay well that was my first question too it took him a while too it was
02:49:18 kind of i wouldn't say he was like not he was like shady in a way but he wasn't forthcoming over
02:49:25 yeah he was not forthcoming about it okay um so he's the i i say like i am what you're asking for
02:49:32 and he says i would love the opportunity to chat and pick your brain please let me buy coffee or
02:49:37 lunch so we can spend some time talking about it will you be available next week are you located
02:49:41 in boston sure and so i'm like oh shit i have to tell him that i'm in san diego i'll tell him
02:49:46 that i'm visiting san diego and so i do that i continue to lie to him yeah but but but also
02:49:51 please tell me about your app so he he links me as his app after i i try a few messages of me trying
02:49:57 to ask about about it um and then he explains it uh what does it matter if i name the app i don't
02:50:03 fucking care i don't think so yeah uh uh it's worth t or worthy t um it's pronounced worth it but
02:50:15 it's it's it's just the word oh got it got it yeah worth it yeah yep okay um he links me he links me
02:50:22 like a youtube trailer and here's what he says uh it is a you know you remember form spring right
02:50:28 then your form spring i never used it um but you know what it is remind me it's you have an
02:50:35 account and people can ask you questions it's purely for questions oh yeah yeah yeah right sure yeah okay um
02:50:42 this but it's it this is that however you have to pay money to ask questions um
02:50:50 okay i i get it yeah sure so it's like super chats but only like no video it just is nothing
02:51:00 nothing but yeah you know that makes enough sense yeah i can i can understand i can understand the
02:51:08 thing there sure got it and and then and then uh he says we'd love to get your feedback on it um
02:51:14 things such as if it if it's something you in your community would use what you like or we don't
02:51:18 like about it etc uh please let me know um and i get that message and i pull a bin saint super hard
02:51:28 i read it and i think and i think that's something i should really i should respond eloquently to
02:51:33 i should put a lot of thought into me responding i'll get i'll get i'll get back to that yeah yeah
02:51:38 i'll get back to that way hardcore yeah um smash cut to a month later i'm like oh
02:51:46 shit i forgot about that yeah uh and so i respond super apologetically uh and i explain like it's
02:51:54 it's a cool idea i suppose i'll try it out maybe and i'll let you know um i said that i would pass
02:52:01 on to digi which i i'm not going to or had any intention to it was a straight up lie uh um
02:52:08 and and uh i was just like um yeah uh you know it's it's interesting i'll give it a shot
02:52:14 and then he spawns another thing uh and he's he says something effective um like like can you
02:52:21 tell me more about you and your group and i'm like ooh like here's my chance to explain who i am and
02:52:27 maybe he can scratch my back in some way well it's a free it's a free uh rpg you can play on your
02:52:35 yeah and uh and and that was uh two months ago yep i haven't responded uh well you know
02:52:44 i mean whatever who gives a shit i i i i'm i'm always i'm always trying to find ways to
02:52:52 shill endless war that's that's not it's never working it's never it's never ever in what way
02:52:58 is that a shilling opportunity what what do we possibly stand to gain literally nothing yeah
02:53:03 literally nothing yeah but but but you see it's it's it's it's like um fuck it's like it's like the
02:53:09 animal part of your brain that wants you to have sex and procreate it's like if i can just even talk
02:53:14 about it then i'll i'll have some way to tell something to gain if i can literally just mention
02:53:19 it to anyone who's willing to listen i don't i don't feel that way at all yeah for me it's like
02:53:26 why bother mentioning it to anyone okay as as it's obviously clear from everything i've talked about
02:53:33 like the multiple times right so i got my intention here is to show my product and all three times i've
02:53:38 mentioned on the show have been completely like there's no way they could possibly happen
02:53:42 i'm aware that like the ways i'm doing this are completely like wrong and there's no rhyme or reason
02:53:48 to believe that the things like going to this meeting with me are going to go for boston or
02:53:52 respond to this guy who wants to develop an app in any way could help me i understand that that's
02:53:57 true however it doesn't stop me from wanting it to be the case it doesn't stop me from just wanting
02:54:03 because like what do i have to lose to respond to this guy and like he's he's asking for for
02:54:07 podcasts in the boston area whatever i'll just fucking lie to him just here but tell me what you
02:54:12 can offer me but i don't know yeah but the answer he gave you an answer and it was nothing um yeah
02:54:19 you're right and that's sort of why i stopped responding yeah okay good i just want you to
02:54:25 understand that like the problem here is not oh no why did i stop responding the the the the end
02:54:31 goal is here is so naturally i stopped responding the end good end we made it oh well yeah i'm not
02:54:40 trying to imply that i should have kept responding after i realized that this would not work for the
02:54:46 our fans in any way i mean uh i mean yeah well i mean even if it did even if it did it's not like
02:54:54 it's not like knowing this guy who made the app confers any benefit on us whatsoever
02:55:01 we would just have access to the app like everyone else right true uh i don't know i don't know maybe
02:55:08 there's there maybe you see we could get we could get we could i feel like i'm uh i'm i'm lucy from
02:55:14 i love lucy and i feel like just knowing famous people will get me uh it's not a famous person
02:55:20 this is a nobody who's making some app but but he has he he's developing an app and he never
02:55:26 surely must know pewdiepie are you okay all right all right listen i i know i know it's irrational
02:55:32 i completely understand don't get it but i'll get a little but listen i just listen again any chance
02:55:39 i can even say the words endless war or pcp my brain shoots up and i get a dopamine rush
02:55:46 the moment the moment anyone says that to me at all what why don't you take that nervous energy you
02:55:51 got and put it to some use like impossible even like instead of fucking contacting a random app
02:56:00 developer why don't you why don't you send a fucking press send a fucking press release to the gaming
02:56:05 journalist or something you know because i saw his post on okay listen i saw his post on r slash
02:56:12 oh i'm i like okay you know what stop defending yourself you're right i should stop okay good
02:56:22 i'm glad we figured it out we found we found the solution if only if only if only he reversed
02:56:30 what you gotta get on the app we gotta get on that app if we gotta get on it it's uh
02:56:35 i mean it's not a terrible idea but we're not famous enough i think i made an account and i
02:56:42 did i like i i think i linked it on my twitter and i uh i never checked it again you linked it
02:56:48 well you linked your okay worth it yeah worth it strange name why do you think it's called that
02:56:54 like man asking this question was totally worth it uh no idea i know who i was looking i was talking
02:57:03 to too there's a list of a good team it's kenny it's kenny lee i was talking to
02:57:11 he is fucking mainlanders but he doesn't even believe in ghosts uh well i was asking
02:57:19 that's what i'm gonna dm him i'm gonna say hey listen before we go any further with this what do
02:57:23 you think about ghosts yeah you guys have ghosts on the mainland because we got ghosts in space if
02:57:30 we don't have ghosts but i don't know if we're gonna be able to work together just ask him hey
02:57:36 question you guys got ghosts on the mainland no context context is the enemy
02:57:45 fuck you see this is why i want to go to boston round cable is because i'm just so eager to
02:57:51 collaborate like collaboration at any cost talking to other people at any cost no matter
02:57:56 yeah in any form um i mean i should probably have like the opposite problem
02:58:05 we're like i i like don't i like don't talk about it unless i'm sure that like there's some
02:58:11 like tangible benefit to doing so and other other than i'm like i mean you know what's the point
02:58:17 bring that up you know whatever like that's just the thing um i you know i'm casting a wide net
02:58:27 bin i'm talking to literally everyone and eventually there has to be someone who actually cares well
02:58:33 sure well here's the thing even if they cared so what you get like one guy to join the server
02:58:39 that that guy that guy could tell other guys or or maybe it's not like like i'm trying to sell
02:58:45 that person like i'm not like i'm not trying to get like that one guy but i'm trying to get people
02:58:50 some that guy who maybe has a platform to share it yeah sure sure um hey let me let me bring it back
02:59:01 to the round table yeah let me ask you so like i think they do like a i think they do like a
02:59:08 newsletter or something and like people contribute like comics to like the newsletter uh
02:59:13 i'm just curious if like that's something you would want to do because like i never ended up doing it
02:59:20 but i thought about it like oh maybe i just you know draw some shit and like put it in this
02:59:24 fucking like a zine basically like a zine like they kind of have their own zine yeah so well it's
02:59:31 it's what you're describing is just that like it is like they have a newsletter and you can just
02:59:36 like draw like a like like a like a like a um a funny in the local paper pretty bad like a
02:59:42 like a garfield strip i think uh yeah i think maybe they they took like full page ones as well
02:59:49 but yeah pretty much more or less um well uh no but not because of the underlying idea of it
03:00:04 not that like it's just like work to do to get my work seen by people in any capacity
03:00:10 which is something i'm into i don't know if i have a particular want to do that type of work
03:00:15 though i might not be understanding it completely well i think i got a glitch oh yeah yeah a corpse
03:00:21 just turned into a pink rectangle oh come on developers come on sad sad uh but sorry state
03:00:30 of india games with all these days oh wait it's gone i think it faded okay whatever i i i do like i
03:00:36 think i think zines are cool in concept and i don't have a i don't have a any issue with doing it
03:00:42 just in like the abstract though i think just maybe like like if it is indeed like a garfield funny
03:00:48 i don't know if i want to do that no i don't think i mean i think it can be whatever you want
03:00:54 okay like it's just you know did you make a comic are you do you are you in the boston comics
03:00:59 round table put your comic in the round table newsletter because that's what we're about
03:01:04 well then okay yeah if it just is like you can like like have like an ad for your comic or something
03:01:11 i don't just like your comic i don't think it yeah i don't think it's like they hand you off a script
03:01:16 and are like here make this or anything well yeah sure i don't think so but i i i thought i might have
03:01:22 been like like you remember comic strips from the newspaper we should have those but for our
03:01:29 newsletter because it's like quirky in a way kind of no i i think it's just whatever you
03:01:33 want to make pretty much okay well then yeah i'm not actually sure i'm not actually sure because
03:01:37 i never actually did it or really look much into it i knew that they did this sort of thing i think
03:01:42 they do them like maybe every couple months or something um i have no idea what i would do but
03:01:48 yeah i do have an interesting i think i think that could be cool yeah i i told you about that one
03:01:52 homesick sign that i signed up for but i got rejected for yes you mentioned you mentioned it
03:01:59 uh yeah it wasn't an official thing though right uh it was pseudo official it was like
03:02:05 endorsed by will pumpkin it was made by fans but like what pumpkin like supported them in a way
03:02:11 okay yeah was it canon was it technically technically i'm serious i'm serious was it like
03:02:18 no no not at all i mean i mean it wasn't like a story it just was pictures of homesick people oh okay
03:02:25 lame dumb uh i'm almost glad in a way that i didn't get selected because uh that that whole
03:02:32 operation was a huge shit show and uh very untrustworthy what do you mean untrustworthy
03:02:39 do you think they would have not followed through just like low art and and uh and uh
03:02:43 oh liliah and all these other losers that i failed to collab with it it took them 10 months
03:02:51 to select a a like like the roster for people who were doing art uh weird yeah very weird
03:03:03 when they said it would take them like a like a couple like a week a couple weeks 10
03:03:09 that just speaks to like some weird priorities or something by the way my quest my sub quest this
03:03:17 round is to i have to drop i want to drop this weird egg into fire and hatch it into a serpent
03:03:25 that's my that's my that's um that's something i want that's something i want for myself
03:03:30 mm-hmm yeah wait wait so so why did you say that you just didn't happen to do this newsletter
03:03:39 thing or that you didn't want to for a reason uh i think i was just like
03:03:47 what's the point i was just like eh you know that sounds kind of neat maybe i'll do it but
03:03:52 kind of lazy eyes i'm not even gonna worry about it you know i just like didn't really worry about
03:03:56 it imagine if you had like a like one of the like like the first vaporette but it's in there
03:04:01 and it's just like a small interaction i mean that just seems like why wouldn't i do that
03:04:10 i gotta fuck i gotta write some vaporettes because i am trying to hopefully do the
03:04:17 fucking vapor's three vapor's two kickstarter sand i need some fucking vaporettes for that
03:04:22 i want to do another one and don't worry i won't try it all this time good good as we discuss
03:04:28 trying is the trying is the path to failing my vapor is sick though yeah um kazi wants to do one
03:04:38 i told her she wants to do one vaporettes are cool i told her she could months ago
03:04:42 like months and months ago and uh sometimes she makes fun of me i still haven't given her one
03:04:48 to do because i haven't written anything oh i mean and that's fair you know whatever yeah i mean
03:04:54 instead of writing vaporettes you should be writing real vapor's which is what you're doing so
03:04:57 yeah yeah pretty much um i
03:05:06 one you know
03:05:09 i don't know i haven't thinking about like thinking about like uh money and like my future
03:05:16 uh oh uh oh i know right i'm just thinking like in the absence of some kind of hard to foresee
03:05:25 event where like i gain a lot of exposure very fast you know like i don't know if my audience
03:05:32 i don't know if like my my audience is gonna grow like i you know i've been wondering about
03:05:37 my growth potential like i did the poo videos kind of because i thought it was like it would
03:05:43 might be a good way to grow and reach new audience uh turns out no um i don't think the poo audience
03:05:51 is that big i mean do people know what poo is i don't know i thought i thought it'd be interesting
03:05:58 tom is telling us about that that video series the digi i think i think he did it i think for
03:06:03 fron games did you retrospective of the tales of series yeah that's a good video i actually
03:06:08 really like that also i mean i think i'm in it sort of wait were you i don't know but he
03:06:14 mentions me by name because one of the characters he named one of the characters after me and he
03:06:19 reminds of me that's that's cool yeah uh but like like that was to like capitalize on like it was a
03:06:26 series that like not people have a lot of people to talk about maybe there wasn't a quote-unquote
03:06:30 community for but like a lot of people like it and remember it so it might be a good thing it was
03:06:34 it was like that where it's like maybe like maybe it's not like a poo community per se but it's like
03:06:39 you know everyone knows like people are nostalgic for it people remember it people are interested
03:06:43 to hear about it that's i don't know that was the idea it didn't work out and i don't know why
03:06:48 but whatever um so so you're afraid you're stagnating you're you're plateaued well
03:06:56 well i mean in terms of audience in terms of reach sure like what's how like how do you get big
03:07:07 how do people how do people even fucking get big i think the way you get big is what we were talking
03:07:12 about earlier you focus on one thing do it a lot i don't think that's true munchie because i see
03:07:17 people that do that and don't get big example i could name a dozen people in my fucking twitter
03:07:26 who make comics i'm not doubting i'm first of all i'm not trying to doubt that that like that
03:07:32 is possible or that even is not the case i'm just saying there might be something they aren't doing
03:07:38 correctly like like like like i don't know if that necessary like there are a lot of things that go
03:07:46 into like someone's success online and i think that i don't know just because there are people who
03:07:51 are doing that but like but not succeeding is the case because there are people who do succeed
03:07:57 that do do that you know i think those people are the exception well then what do you think
03:08:05 or they are doing right does is luck do you think it's luck yes yes basically basically
03:08:13 a hundred percent okay yeah i mean maybe that's a little pessimistic well it's not a hundred percent
03:08:21 i mean but like i mean okay like obviously you have to be a certain level of talented
03:08:25 think about that lots of people are that level of talented i think people don't really talk about a
03:08:31 lot it's you do have to even if you're not talented in the way that we would think if you're not
03:08:38 interesting or something no matter what it like i'll take being a youtuber uh yeah to be
03:08:44 my same here no matter even if you're just like a shit boilerplate uh like like an analyst you
03:08:50 still have to work hard to put out videos yeah it's not yeah no listen talent and hard work are
03:08:58 necessary but not sufficient okay and i think the last thing is you just have to get lucky
03:09:05 and some people do and some people don't there's nothing you can do the only thing you can do
03:09:08 about it is keep trying and and not give up and like let let it just just keep hoping i would say it
03:09:14 depends i don't know i don't know if that's i mean i think there did you ever do you ever do this
03:09:20 do you ever like find some content or a content creator and just look at like you know a little
03:09:26 sample of their work and then try and guess like hmm what do i think this person's making on patreon
03:09:32 you ever try never play that game no i don't i play that game yeah is it only would you say it's
03:09:42 more or less or just just fluctuate it's just a fun thing to get i got it a long imprisoned
03:09:47 serpent it looks hungry but wait hello can you hear me yeah can you hear me yes i can hear you
03:09:54 is it is higher is it lower than you expect or is it just fluctuate no the thing the thing is
03:09:59 that i'm pretty good at guessing and i get pretty close a lot of the time and i don't know what that
03:10:07 means like that i can just like sometimes you can just look at someone's work like what kind of videos
03:10:13 they're making and just be like i bet i bet i know what this i bet i know how much this person's
03:10:17 making on patreon and like i get pretty close and i guess that means that there is a correlation but
03:10:24 like you maybe it is like predictable and like gameable and it's not just luck because like if
03:10:31 you can predict it based on what they're making then like clearly there's a rhyme or reason behind it
03:10:40 i don't know if there's ever a patreon that i feel like it doesn't make sense for the person
03:10:47 that it makes that that that means like in the sense that like it's either way more or substantially
03:10:53 less i'm trying to think if there's a patreon that doesn't make sense in the sense that it's
03:11:01 either way more or substantially less than what i would imagine they're making i can only think
03:11:05 of anyone that doesn't like fit in a way but it might just because it is what it is and i haven't
03:11:10 really thought about it till now so it just makes like like of course it's that that's what's always
03:11:14 better
03:11:23 uh i don't know you like fuck oh dead i'm just i got the fucking serpent i got the
03:11:32 fucking serpent but i didn't feed it enough price you you come across people online that you think
03:11:38 should be making way more than they are right that's not a weird thing to observe
03:11:43 yeah mostly me well it's mostly it's artists like artists and well sure well i mean the thing
03:11:50 like the difference is hard you mean like visual art is that what you mean like specifically yeah
03:11:55 yeah yeah like the difference the difference in skill between like a person who's making thousands
03:12:01 of dollars and a person who's making like tens can be like nothing and it makes me so mad
03:12:10 just thinking about it and if you want if you want to make money as an illustrator online
03:12:17 you gotta do porn yeah and you can't and i don't get it i don't get who gives you money for that
03:12:27 uh they just want to do well make their we go hard
03:12:31 by seeing so many ways to do that there's so many ways to do that why do you need to give
03:12:36 your money to this specific person to accomplish that aim i don't i don't get it
03:12:42 uh you like dart style i i guess yeah sure i mean i would never do it it's it's never something
03:12:52 i would want to it's it's always so disheartening though to see someone who you think should be
03:12:57 earning a lot but then just they aren't it's so weird okay i well i mean i i mean i am one of
03:13:02 those people so i have no pity for anyone uh i found this channel that i really enjoy called
03:13:10 j foreman and he's like a he's a british dude who makes videos he makes video series talking about
03:13:15 um for instance he has a series where he talks about like unfinished public works projects in
03:13:21 london talking about like very specific i know like like unused train lines and stuff like that
03:13:28 and like plans for highways that never got built that sounds like the kind of thing that is not
03:13:34 interesting but could be made interesting with the right sort of narration style he does he does yeah
03:13:40 yeah um how and and you think this guy's gonna have no views but he's extremely popular well
03:13:49 maybe not extremely but he's way more than 100 100k followers 100k subs no dude almost 400k wow
03:13:59 wow okay god damn yeah he doesn't break a million on any of his videos but he gets
03:14:04 sort of close sometimes and is usually usually on like one of his main series he gets like above
03:14:10 500k um pretty good so he's doing good youtube wise but his patreon is just like a thousand dollars
03:14:19 that's not bad that's not bad that's nothing to complain about it's nothing to complain about
03:14:25 however i don't know it sort of feels disconnected from me from his subscribers and his views to his
03:14:32 low for 400 you know you know 500k for something so for something so like weird and something that
03:14:43 like nobody else is doing that's the kind of thing that i would expect to have a disproportionately
03:14:48 high patreon yes exactly that's what i'm trying to say it's like yeah i don't know how this has so
03:14:52 many views but so many not people who resonate with it it's not like these are like particularly like
03:15:00 boilerplate videos at all i mean even just by their subject matter they aren't popular i wouldn't
03:15:05 imagine like there's a guy called um there's a guy called krug smash who makes like he makes like
03:15:12 narratively focused dwarf fortress let's plays they're really good and he does art for them and
03:15:17 stuff and they're he's he's he's got some really that's some really great stuff but he makes like
03:15:23 i think he's only gotten the tens of thousands but he makes like uh he makes like a like like three
03:15:31 or four thousand dollars a month on patreon or something like a relatively small audience um
03:15:36 because it's niche because it's niche and nobody else does it the way he does that's the thing like
03:15:40 how can you watch these videos be one of like the like almost a million people who have done so
03:15:49 and then like and like subscribe to him but then like not care enough about this weird niche
03:15:55 interest to like patron him like why are you watching this it just feels weird i don't know man
03:16:02 maybe it's not it's not the fact okay it's not okay if it was just like he was getting
03:16:05 shit views and his patreon that was that i would understand yeah yeah exactly it's just that he's
03:16:11 getting so much views like it's it's just that his views are weird to be this seems like the kind of
03:16:18 thing that a small group is really passionate about and you would think they would be like you
03:16:26 know really eager to support him yeah that's that is that is what i would like think but instead it's
03:16:32 weirdly mainstream and no one really cares enough well i i i don't i don't want to care
03:16:37 rise his patreon is this it's like it's like uh you know it's not a wasteland yeah yeah yeah
03:16:42 but you get what i mean i get you yeah hmm i mean who's someone else who's got like 400k
03:16:50 i mean i'll bet i yeah in g question mark let me tell you no he's like three he's like less than
03:16:57 three oh he has equal amount to him so he's at 375 and the guy i'm just like oh literally the
03:17:04 exact same 375 both of them no shit yeah i should also mention by the way that this guy's been on
03:17:11 like the bbc and stuff so like he's like really popular in the uk i suppose or at least like the
03:17:18 london area question mark hmm maybe it's a demographic thing like maybe british people don't
03:17:26 patreon as much or something you know maybe aren't we lucky to be in america and every and all
03:17:38 art is catered towards us yeah i think the answer is yes it is i agree i mean it's convenient i don't
03:17:50 know well i mean would i really care if like every story i read was set in england no that wouldn't
03:18:00 bother me i don't know if that's i just mean uh well it's not the fact that just it's it's set in
03:18:07 another place but just i don't know like our the culture we have is so ubiquitous in everything
03:18:13 ranging from like narratives to like the like just settings of narratives to just like like anything in
03:18:19 art is made with like the americans might want to watch this unless it's like something super niche
03:18:24 like anime or something count counter argument i mean that yeah american culture is pervasive
03:18:31 but not just in media just in general so like well sure other places kind of have a lot
03:18:38 have pretty similar cultures anyway so like if american media is made for an american audience
03:18:44 an audience with american sensibilities that is actually a lot of the world beyond america
03:18:49 because there's so much like cultural lead over um i don't disagree with all i don't think that i
03:18:55 mean i mean i think that's true i i also think that if for instance you live in a vastly different
03:19:03 culture you the like the sort of stuff that might appeal to you like well okay well actually
03:19:09 let me rephrase that it might be that you kind of maybe not are forced to at all but just like
03:19:16 you know a lot of art is you know for like american sensibility and uh it might not be based around
03:19:25 not like the overwhelming majority of things might not be uh it's something that you might want to
03:19:29 partake in as a member of a different culture kind of talking about my ass right now dude i love
03:19:34 partaking in culture i hate it you know what you're right sorry uh the why i'm looking at
03:19:43 patrons right now you've got me interested uh did you hear about try and get play the game
03:19:48 try and try and like when you find a content creator and you see they have a patreon it's
03:19:52 trying guess it's trying trying to do that do you know about patreon pro no oh ben i don't think
03:20:00 you're gonna like this hold on a new update coming to patreon uh they're raising the cut of how much
03:20:07 they get they uh uh they get or they take from creators uh and they're having it scale
03:20:12 with how much money you make wait what explain yes so okay you can go to patreon.com slash uh new
03:20:22 creator plans uh literally do that literally do that right now i i don't i'm trying to find the rat
03:20:30 you're never gonna do it then no i got a good feeling about this one so they're doing sort of
03:20:36 like a twitch affiliate thing almost kind of what youtube does where when you're a small patreon
03:20:42 and you're starting out you don't have as many tools available to you so there are gonna be three
03:20:48 tiers of creator there's going to be picture on light patreon pro and patreon premium oh my god
03:20:55 okay and when you start out a patreon you can't have multiple like tiers of of like of like um
03:21:03 like like donation okay so uh so you can't like for instance if you just start out a patreon
03:21:13 you cannot have like five dollar month patrons get this one dollar a month patients get this
03:21:19 ten dollar pensions get this you cannot do that now if you just start a patreon
03:21:24 but like old patreon old patrons won't be effective um no they won't okay ones will uh
03:21:32 well i don't why i don't know what what what do they what do they gain from that
03:21:44 well let me read their blurb yeah sure oh okay like they say new creator plans then immediately
03:21:52 they say in bold no change for current creators on patreon so like please don't get mad at us if
03:21:56 you're already on patreon like if they okay so clearly they know this is like a bad and unpopular
03:22:01 thing why do they want it okay let's see patreon has grown in our community of creators has grown
03:22:10 with us we now serve so many different types of creators from a painter with 100 fans who created
03:22:14 business with 100k fans and a staff of 25 this allows us to tailor our offerings to different
03:22:19 types of creators we're also introducing a new payment processing rates for our future creators
03:22:23 including a new low rate of payments for three dollars or less um so basically wait i'm interested
03:22:29 in that part because that actually might make me more money um well they they're they're having
03:22:36 a tax in the rich scenario i yeah exactly explain um okay so okay this could this could be good or
03:22:44 bad for me um i'm trying to see uh with new low rates for smoke okay future creators will choose
03:22:53 one of the above plans uh detailing light probe premium and we'll have new payment processing
03:22:59 rates including a special low rate for small pledges pledges of three dollars or less we'll
03:23:03 use the micro payment rate of five percent plus ten percent for successful payment wait wait wait
03:23:09 wait wait wait wait wait five percent plus ten percent plus ten cents okay oh okay so it's not
03:23:20 it's not by how much a creator is making it's by how much the individual donation is
03:23:25 yes oh that sucks that's fucking stupid okay so here are the rates for new um
03:23:33 patron things and this does affect you yeah uh uh okay okay so if you're a light user so it means
03:23:39 you just start a new a new patreon get five percent which i believe it is now wait no no
03:23:44 stop stop hold on i'm very confused because it sounded like you were just saying that the
03:23:48 the rate depends on the pledge not based on the creator and how much they're making
03:23:54 that why i just described the three dollars thing i was just talking about previously
03:23:58 that it only affects small pledges that affects the pledges that people make we're not to explain
03:24:04 now is related to the patron thing they're they're not related they are just they're just changes
03:24:10 that are separate but they have to be related because that that doesn't make any sense but the
03:24:16 the the amount that they're taking the the amount of cut they're taking
03:24:21 has it can't like those those things those things don't exist in a vacuum like yeah like the pledge
03:24:28 has an amount and the creator is making an amount and if the amount of that they're taking in fees
03:24:35 depends on one or the other it matters which is no okay okay it's not that they're not related
03:24:43 but it's okay it's like um okay the base rate if you're a light member of patreon which is like
03:24:49 the lowest tier is is is five and when you go up the leaderboard and you get to a pro status
03:24:57 once you have more patrons it goes up from five percent to eight percent but if you have people
03:25:02 who are still pledging like we're pledging you even though you have a higher percent or you have
03:25:08 more patrons and you are a bigger patron and you are a pro patron user if they are doing smaller
03:25:15 pledges they they still have the base amount they send you so five percent do you get what i'm saying
03:25:23 no okay well it makes sense okay okay okay okay let's say you're let's say you are a creator
03:25:32 you are a pro creator
03:25:40 and you and the baseline every person who pageants you uh patron takes a eight percent cut
03:25:48 let's analyze two patrons of yours one person who does one dollar and one person who does twenty
03:25:55 dollars the person who pledges twenty dollars will be affected by your higher rate of eight percent
03:26:01 because that's what that that's the base rate for your patron your your patreon now okay but small
03:26:09 pledges are affected at their own like smaller amount yes okay you know what that does make
03:26:14 sense i i got you okay okay um so it goes up to to eight percent uh but for you it will stay five
03:26:22 percent just so your grandfather did uh for premium users it goes up to 12 percent if you're new
03:26:29 and nine percent if you're old so so this means my rate's gonna go down so that's good well oh wait
03:26:37 um i guess yeah okay you know what you're right it will well but but if you will write but but but
03:26:43 if you grow more then it will go down uh well yeah but i'd be growing more uh true so worth it
03:26:53 well this actually sounds like a well i mean i'm gonna have to look this over
03:26:58 but it sounds like another thing to mention is that features are are gated behind
03:27:04 other but but not for me because i am already having a count no they will be gated for you
03:27:09 still like what um i don't think anything that you might care about but there are there's stuff like
03:27:17 um you can have let me here let me see uh there's there's there's some bulletless here uh dedicated
03:27:24 partner manager which i'm not really sure what that means merch for membership which i believe
03:27:28 is some sort of like patreon built in merch store and a team account which might affect
03:27:35 i i don't know if we were at a higher level that might have effect pc yes not this sounds like none of
03:27:42 it affects me um well also also by the way um hold on hold on wait actually let me see
03:27:54 i guess it would be bad if it affected the pcp
03:27:58 as well that would affect me indirectly no i wouldn't affect me directly actually
03:28:05 i'm trying to read it's kind of hard to parse something here okay premium is the best for
03:28:10 creators that expect to make at least 2500 a month on patreon so the 12 percent fee equals to 300
03:28:17 dollars a month do you have to like opt in or is it automatic no no no okay then what's the
03:28:21 point of saying it's best for it's like it doesn't matter we're forcing it on you
03:28:26 fucking god i i hate patreon i hate their attitude
03:28:32 this ensures our costs provide the services to premium yay i got it okay so they're saying if you
03:28:39 make over 2500 a month of that they will take uh 300 dollars in processing
03:28:49 um what percentage is that about 12 percent oh yeah okay well uh okay so that's a little more
03:28:58 because i think they take like nine percent now no they take five percent they take five percent
03:29:03 wait they take five percent now yeah oh what it was more than double i thought they take nine percent
03:29:12 okay well in that case then it's only bad so we so all that's happening is that they're just
03:29:18 taking more from big creators and taking the same amount from small creators yes uh unless you are
03:29:26 i think in your case if you were to have created a a patreon uh after these changes are implemented
03:29:33 and you are a new account they would have been charging you more like and you had the same
03:29:37 amount of money that you're making if you just had a new account and you didn't you didn't have the
03:29:41 grandfathered in rates then you would then they would be taking more from you because you were
03:29:45 like a medium fuck um hmm all right well sounds well awful bad okay stupid um
03:29:57 um um what's that other patreon alternative subscribe star subscribe star yeah maybe i should
03:30:07 make a subscribe star but it has a bad name been it has a stupid name yeah but well look i mean i
03:30:14 haven't looked that deeply into it but i mean i complain about patreon a lot i'm sure i'm sure
03:30:21 that i'm sure there's at least one nazi on there though so i think we might have to label the entire
03:30:25 operation uh stephen molyneux on there uh i don't i don't like that i don't like that guy yeah
03:30:34 we got we got to do something about him uh we got to be black warming insert poorly edited uh
03:30:42 youtube poop of the end of star wars episode three where obi once says you're supposed to
03:30:47 destroy this if not join them yeah but anakin's face is replaced with the old patreon logo
03:30:52 you should make that you should just make that and it would probably go viral on you know what
03:30:59 literally literally it might yeah literally it might uh oh if i had been like literally the day
03:31:07 was announced i i fucking to shit you not that probably would have literally gone back the day
03:31:11 that this announcement was announced yeah yeah yeah well you fucked up yeah i guess i did
03:31:16 well doesn't didn't dick masterson make his own patreon alternative he did but like it's uh
03:31:27 you know i you know you he has to like personally accept you right it's not like just anyone can
03:31:33 sign up for it and like apparently he just like does it like from his own like bank account
03:31:41 uh okay so i'm sure he isn't looking to like you know make it a huge platform with tons of
03:31:46 because like you know so i'm sure it's just going to be like for a couple of people that he thinks
03:31:51 need you know the patreon alternative he's like wants to personally endorse or whatever subscribe
03:31:57 about star please change your name it's so shit um yeah i mean i don't know is it too is it that bad
03:32:06 like how bad is it i think i think it's pretty clunky i think it's pretty stupid and clunky
03:32:12 subscribe star yeah it's pretty it's not it's not it's not great patreon is a lot more it feels
03:32:18 like off-brand like like something you would like like it there's it's like um it's like it's like
03:32:23 an off-brand soda it feels like it feels like mr. pibb to to do patreon i mean are you sure you
03:32:30 would continue to feel that way if it became something that a lot of people used or is that
03:32:36 just your bias is that just your your currency bias or whatever recency i don't know whatever
03:32:42 i don't think that like the the thing itself is i just think the name is like that i don't i
03:32:47 i i think the actual thing itself i know what you're saying i'm just saying what if people like
03:32:51 what if it caught on and it was big and everyone was on subscribe star would it still sound like
03:32:55 like bargain bin patreon i don't know i don't think it's i don't think it's too bad it's not you
03:33:01 know whatever i'll take it i'll take it yep there you go subscribe star i love you don't ever change
03:33:09 please don't adapt ever no
03:33:15 look look look look at it they got um they got the lighthouse project um okay definitely know
03:33:19 who that is yeah yeah yeah yeah they got um um military the history visualized cool sure yeah
03:33:29 what why not uh shon fits jerald uh that's just a household name it is yeah um yeah don't you
03:33:39 know don't you know about scott fits jerald i'm sorry shon fits jerald he um he made that one thing
03:33:45 on youtube oh i love that one thing i got a patreon him love i'm sorry subscribe i'm sorry i love that
03:33:50 one thing i want to go to the boss and i want to go to the boss and college and table really bad
03:33:58 right now by the way i'm just depressed that i haven't gone it makes me so sad it's not that hard i
03:34:04 know that's the point and i don't know i don't know why i didn't i have like no reason not to
03:34:11 and i just didn't do it been i'm gonna set an alarm shit for you to pasture you Wednesday night to go
03:34:19 isn't it Thursday i know that's what i'm saying so the night before you know what yeah it'd probably
03:34:27 be good for me uh i'm saying this up right i'm i have been i mean double-edged sword i have been very
03:34:38 i've had very little in the way of distraction i've gotten a lot of work done on vapors on the other
03:34:44 hand i've had like no social life um so you know that's that's that's it that's the thing i i i could
03:34:56 foresee this being somewhat well okay i mean it obviously depends you might go there it might be
03:35:00 just like shit and make you depressed and feel like no one's ever changed like you described earlier
03:35:05 yep but i don't i don't think it's unlike i don't think if you were to bet if i was a gambling man
03:35:11 i would not bet against the fact that you might even it might be useful to you to just even just
03:35:18 to be around other comic people and not even just necessarily show your own thing but though obviously
03:35:22 that would be an official name but uh to do what i was describing earlier about like i don't know
03:35:27 i i kind of feel like i'm losing out not really knowing what other comic people or what other
03:35:31 youtubers are up to i feel a little like i'm losing out in that way yeah totally i don't know i you
03:35:37 know i've thought a lot about that like about my feelings of like complete and utter disconnect
03:35:46 from the like comics community as a thing and and just like i i feel like maybe i this kind of
03:35:56 come it's sort of related to the whole like you know don't spread yourself too thin you know master
03:36:00 of one and all uh like you know maybe i should have tried harder to get into that whole thing maybe
03:36:07 i would be maybe i would have a better like network or something if i had like quoted that more
03:36:13 in some way but i don't know i just don't know i don't even know what i think about i don't even
03:36:19 know if i think it's good i i mean i'll tell you this bit yeah you go to bostoncomics.com
03:36:25 and you you you scroll down in boston comics round table it's just bostoncomics.com as the
03:36:31 is the urinal they have um and they have a promotional image for lgbt comics from the
03:36:37 boston comics round table and it is this image of presumably all of the lgbt comic authors all
03:36:44 their characters and like a big group shot and this just screams to me like people who go here
03:36:51 are connected they know who each other are yeah and it is a very clear community that has formed
03:36:59 here and i think because it's so close to you and it's so related to your work and it's not at all
03:37:05 hard to go to i think there's almost no reason not to attend this thing i almost no reason not
03:37:12 i just you know again i have known for this whole year that there's no reason not to
03:37:19 do i'm just like i just find you know i just find excuses if if hold on i'm i'm gonna i'm
03:37:26 gonna link to find excuses not to do the thing that i want to do unequivocally
03:37:32 all right okay boy what boy i'm sure would suck to go do that thing
03:37:36 imagine vincent and magna here it underneath the being true pride flag i can't for you the lgbt
03:37:43 conica it's just too it's too good to be true i you put but you know what maybe i should dream
03:37:49 bigger look look at this shit look all these varied characters you could be one of them
03:37:54 let me see hold on look look at all these very these varied characters who all look like they
03:37:59 were designed by someone who just got out of college and they just are a person
03:38:07 why are you showing me this what you're so are you supposed to be encouraging me
03:38:11 no what okay that's so boring it's so it's so fucking dull oh wait i remember
03:38:19 i remembered why i'm not involved in the comics community or go to any of these things or or
03:38:24 or care care about this at all is because i'm a big fucking elitist who turns his nose up at
03:38:29 everyone else's shit the things that's retarded yep that's what and that's what i'm doing that's
03:38:36 doing okay but whatever that image does not fill me with confidence was that drawn by erica
03:38:44 moan was that drawn by erica moan it looks like it was drawn by erica moan but it probably wasn't
03:38:49 it's i don't think she lives here was that drawn by so that person that i hate i don't hate erica
03:38:54 moan do you know who she is no i have no clue she's the ojoy sex toy lady oh i hate only joy six
03:39:01 toy i walk out do you there's there's no reason i would i would understand it looks ugly yeah i
03:39:08 don't fuck you know i like i've said this before i really liked erica moan as a person on strip
03:39:15 search um all of her work is dumb and bad and bad well i mean i'm not interested in it and i don't
03:39:24 like it um which is a shame it's like all of her work is the autobio stuff it's like an autobio
03:39:32 like like like a diary comic that's one that's one big thing she did uh it was oh she did like a
03:39:41 story comic about like a kid finding a lost bicycle and like having to team up with juggalos or
03:39:48 something which sounds really wacky but it's actually totally pedestrian and fuck i shouldn't
03:39:52 have killed that guy with a cape um he's actually like a bonus thing you're supposed to collect
03:39:58 whatever i i thought that's that that's what the child juggalos did during oh no no no that's
03:40:04 whatever anyway that one was fine but it wasn't that interesting wasn't that funny it's just
03:40:08 whatever and then she did ojoy ojoy say after going on strip search uh robert coup advised her
03:40:14 to go in a direction that ended up leading her to ojoy sex toy which naturally was a huge success
03:40:20 for and made her a billion dollars not really but in comics terms it did and uh everyone hates it
03:40:26 also what the fuck's the cup what is that is that what it's called what the fuck yeah what the
03:40:34 fuck yeah what the fuck's the cup oh god it's you know it's pretty funny i don't i don't get
03:40:40 anything out of ojoy sex toy yeah but whatever you know follow follow your bliss i guess
03:40:49 yeah hey let me let me talk about my let me talk about my sour grapes let me talk about my um
03:40:55 ben i was unaware that there was any other aspect of your personality other than sour grapes okay
03:41:01 so i was listening so i've been um i've been listening to so i was breeding alone in my room
03:41:05 late one night as i as i often that goes without saying um like in just like layer that on top of
03:41:12 everything else that i say um i was um i've been listening to the uh fucking i don't don't
03:41:22 ask me why i'm doing this i've been listening to the like penny arcade like a dnd podcast that they do
03:41:28 um like the c team for example mostly the c team which has as one of its players
03:41:35 erica or not erica amy falcone um who was on strip search and actually everything i just said
03:41:43 is unrelated there's um okay but there was another thing i saw i saw like an interview
03:41:49 with amy and um oh god who's the one that did last halloween she was at mice i'm i'm i think
03:41:57 she also amy whatever the one i did last i'll wait these two contestants that were on strip
03:42:01 search i saw an interview with them and so the interview is asking them a bunch of stuff
03:42:07 what because they because they moved in together they briefly became roommates they're talking about
03:42:10 that and i think one of the questions was something like where would you be where would you be if you
03:42:17 had not been on strip search and they both like laugh sort of nervously and say like oh my god
03:42:25 like my life would be so bad if i had not been on strip search and i leaned back and i realized that
03:42:31 ben saint who is not on strip search and living in these two people's personal hell
03:42:38 um what do you think about that i think okay so so you're you're saying like they've made a big
03:42:48 and they're like they're they're economically big and embarrassed to even consider like like
03:42:54 like their idea of like oh god if i if i wasn't famous god if that if that hadn't happened like
03:42:59 everything would suck yeah like like i would just be like toilet in the way just like like
03:43:03 kind of doing stuff in the void and no one would be reading my stuff yeah and you feel
03:43:07 like wait a second that's me that's what's happening to me so i i am the failure i'm the bad timeline
03:43:13 yes that's right well you know what the solution has been you have to be on strip search
03:43:19 you say that like i don't think about that every single day of my life you fucking
03:43:24 wait okay is it actually still running no that's okay no i would fucking
03:43:32 god pester them relentlessly let me i mean this is fucking i've talked about this before it's
03:43:38 fucking sad whatever i'll say it again uh like i saw strip search and i was like this is the coolest
03:43:43 thing ever i want so bad they and they said they were gonna do another one i was like i want so bad
03:43:48 to be on to be on this to be a part of this um so what i'm gonna do so like i'm like it's for
03:43:54 me to actually i'm gonna fucking start drawing you know like more than i did before this was one
03:43:58 of the things that got me like to start taking it more seriously and i was like you know my like i
03:44:06 boy like i hope that like maybe by the time they do strip search too i'll have like you know
03:44:12 i'll hone my skills i'll have more of a following you know maybe it maybe it could make it happen
03:44:18 season two never happens and and well and what did i get out of nothing it was all worthless
03:44:27 it's it's you know what what like what what's a person to do literally what's a person to do
03:44:33 how do you get ahead in this fucking doggy dog world if you if you can't be in strip search
03:44:38 what can you do uh i mean i guess you know i mean i guess i'm being kind of a little baby
03:44:46 about this because like i have the pcp most people don't have the pcp i have the pcp that's
03:44:52 pretty good that's something it is something i mean yeah um but it's not strip search everything
03:45:03 else is inferior nothing else matters even even a little bit um then what anyway anyway this
03:45:11 thought really depressed me and that's it that's the story what would you say is when would you
03:45:17 pinpoint the exact moment when the upward momentum of the pcp died and we uh became the worst people
03:45:24 on earth you know there's a lot of directions you could come at that from do you mean like morally
03:45:32 creatively uh influence wise well all of the above different discussion for each one but i
03:45:40 have to piss really badly i actually have to too um i gotta kill the cannon ball rod
03:45:55 are you kidding me right now dude like get real like get real right now don't you know about

03:51:37 i won got here before you anyway as i was saying jerry jerry jerry and mike just they they got
03:51:44 they got so successful off the backs of like a stupid gaming webcomic they continue to do out
03:51:50 of sheer pseudo creative momentum that they can just do shit that nobody cares about except them
03:51:56 like the fucking irwood nobody gives a shit about the irwood but they're just all about it and they
03:52:00 love it they have the time of their lives i hate them
03:52:10 okay there has to be something practical we can do here we have to turn this anger
03:52:14 in to some sort of like all right how did they get my my guan stones are fucking glitching out
03:52:20 like crazy right now your jio crystals yeah that's right that's right that's correct you did it
03:52:28 you know what okay i've always been a big proponent of like you know i i feel as though you look at
03:52:35 like the top youtube creators or the creators in general and like well sure there's luck there and
03:52:41 you can say they don't have a lot of talent in the way that we would describe it there's obviously
03:52:46 hard work there yeah but i'm trying like there's obviously like like like uh purified and get where
03:52:52 he was by just being idle and just pure luck no not to say that luck is not in a factor you'd never
03:52:59 say that you know if you retarded to say that but um there's obviously something actionable there
03:53:05 where don't you live with don't you know we live in a in a meritocracy month you don't
03:53:08 know that under capitalism everyone always gets exactly what they deserve um everyone has the
03:53:13 exact same starting uh like like everyone starts the exact same level in every way yeah and and
03:53:19 they're rewarded proportionally to their you know to the value that they offer to the world 100%
03:53:26 of the time fuck fuck okay i'm fuck sorry i'm i'm fucking up uh hold on wait one second i just
03:53:34 find okay hold on one second i'm never never mind actually i'm retarded never mind i was i was
03:53:40 going i was going to um say that uh i found you google search pewdiepie one of the first thing
03:53:46 that comes up for me i have no idea why is a video from this person named no life shack
03:53:51 pewdiepie bitch lasagna reaction first time hearing and i was about to say that uh
03:53:57 pewdiepie is so famous that even just reaction videos by no one get a million views but this
03:54:02 guy only has 900 or 900 and one views so i'm now just baffled on why google gave this to me
03:54:08 and why this was one of the first results when pewdiepie came up same so uh cool great
03:54:15 what a mystery it the answer is gotta be just like you just try hard right that's gotta be
03:54:23 how the world is i i want to believe yeah but it's not you just no yeah but it's wrong it's wrong
03:54:29 though it's the only problem there no it can't can't be yeah no sorry it might be i guess
03:54:44 yeah uh and it's very discouraging um
03:54:49 you know it's such major ass i don't know i'm not convinced that i like it can't be manipulated
03:54:56 um i mean it's not that it can't be manipulated it's just that it more it gets more of a chance
03:55:06 there it's just yeah that and there are just um i mean there are ways to manipulate it but not
03:55:14 all of them are possible for everyone and you know there's only so many there's only so many ways to
03:55:20 do it sure you know to to game the system one way or another you have to quote unquote sell out
03:55:32 and i guess it's just a matter of personal preference whether um any of the ways you might do
03:55:38 that are palatable to you and i guess the key is finding a way to do that that is
03:55:44 hmm but but okay like the most influential art on my entire life home stock yeah i wouldn't say
03:55:53 is like a selling out product or is like super almost not at all yeah yeah and that's super
03:56:01 popular you know it's not popular enough and it makes me mad every day that um homestuck is
03:56:09 remembered as anything other than a than a brilliant masterpiece that like anyone says anything bad
03:56:15 about homestuck now i hate them they're cowards what what what bubbler okay wait okay what what
03:56:22 what do you mean that like it's not popular enough it was really popular it was really popular
03:56:30 like people don't like it anymore people talk shit about it that's what you do like you when
03:56:36 people say homes when people say homesuck nowadays they don't mean anything good by it
03:56:40 but that means that that's really determined on who you talk to there are many people who like
03:56:46 everything about homes okay many people many yes i would say the majority fuck fuck fuck i didn't
03:56:53 die i didn't die but i'm going to um
03:57:04 oh god i got him and i oh man i landed on a i landed on a mousetrap but as it so happens it
03:57:12 was in the cutscene okay um okay here to conclude that thought uh i just i think that the zeitgeist
03:57:22 about homestuck now is that it's just sort of an awkward embarrassing thing i think that's
03:57:27 i think that's the general opinion and yeah i know it's got its fans i know a lot of people
03:57:31 still love it and look back fondly on it and everything i don't think that's the majority
03:57:35 opinion it makes me mad i'm mad thinking about it right now i can make
03:57:43 i can make two mistakes i can make two mistakes in this next battle or i'll die
03:57:48 if i make any more of that it really depends on who you talk to
03:57:54 like i'm trying to think about like the homesick community okay okay well okay first of all
03:57:57 the zeitgeist and homesick like faded of like of course like it's nowhere near as popular as it
03:58:03 once was nobody had about that that's fine i just i think people remember it generally people's
03:58:11 big like say it with like a roll of their eye
03:58:18 you know what i actually think i agree but that and maybe not the same way because okay
03:58:26 fuck i think i think that was an easy one for people to fuck god damn it like this is it that's
03:58:33 it watch this video oh you're fucked up you died yep yep well i got further than i did before i
03:58:39 got to a second phase it's uh it's um it's easy for people to watch this and who have
03:58:46 watched armor shield will be like yeah homesick fucked up but it was good in a lot of ways which
03:58:52 is my opinion that it's my favorite thing in the entire world and it makes me mad when i think
03:58:57 about certain aspects of it but like what i want it to not have happened because it makes me upset
03:59:01 in some ways of course not homesick is the best art ever made yeah um but i think okay i think
03:59:09 the majority opinion knowing what i know about the homesick community which i wouldn't say that
03:59:14 okay i'm in bro hold on hold on hold on hold on if we're talking about the homestuck community
03:59:18 specifically i mean obviously it's going to be fondly remembered you know there uh i'm talking
03:59:26 about like the world at large i mean who like i don't mean the homesick community as it like
03:59:32 it currently exists i mean like like like seeing the the the dialogue of it transform over the years
03:59:39 and like people who used to be in homesick who aren't into homesick anymore taking them into
03:59:43 account i don't mean like just like like r slash homestuck okay i mean i i do mean the world at
03:59:51 large i think the general opinion well well to me the world at large includes people that never
03:59:56 read homesick okay well okay we just like have an opinion of it because like they don't like cosplayers
04:00:03 of it yeah hmm yeah okay i can i can see your point i would say okay all of the people who have
04:00:14 read homestuck i would say doesn't just piss you right the fuck off the people have the
04:00:19 fucking the people think they have any right to be like home stuck right uh yeah i completely
04:00:26 understand i would like that sort of thing because it's like they're like the fans are annoying at
04:00:31 homes or at the conventions i feel this way about steven universe two they're not even they were they
04:00:36 were a couple of times you know people who are like steven universe or are like undertale like

04:04:31 it just seems to me right from an outsider looking in right outside of looking in perspective
04:04:36 it seems to me like you meet the penny arcade guys under any circumstances you make them like you
04:04:43 you become their friend and from then on your whole life is just a fucking it's just a fucking
04:04:50 it's just a fucking it's just a no he fucking broke my water barrel idiot quick restart and from
04:04:56 then on you just play d&d and fuck around for the rest of your life and you just have a great time
04:05:01 well okay well actually okay i want to say something because i feel like it was too obvious
04:05:06 and i didn't say it because it was obvious but i actually feel like it might not be obvious
04:05:10 so i should say it please uh it's the the way to accomplish things is how the way that we have
04:05:19 accrued our success which is tied into what everyone else is doing that's collaboration i don't mean
04:05:24 like in a nebulous sense i mean uh like like i described in my college essay it's weaseling
04:05:30 into people's inner circles it's just it's 100 percent trying to be a no good weasel and just
04:05:36 trying to get people to like you you gotta wait what you're a star fucker munchie i am a star
04:05:42 fucker um by the way um i've shown that our fngr video to people like my like offline friends
04:05:49 obviously have no idea who fngr is or i have like a vague notion that like i make youtube videos
04:05:54 sometimes and so to them just like imagine like one of you like your friend like imagine like like
04:05:59 like little john just comes into your room and uh it's like hey i there's someone make a hit like a
04:06:04 hit video on me and he's listening it's just like a slimy fucking snake star fucker like like
04:06:10 mongoloid like munchie like or john like i hate you with all my heart and you and you will be the
04:06:15 downfall of everyone in in your life yeah and how jarring that would be oh that's it's great it's a
04:06:21 great experience it's um well what do they what do they say about it i'm curious they like can't
04:06:29 believe it or also are extremely confused they don't understand what he's saying half the time
04:06:33 because he speaks in such a way i mean that's just that's just fngr for you yeah um so okay
04:06:40 i don't know i don't know how much we can learn from that specifically but anyway okay so think
04:06:45 about like like that's that's very interesting if you didn't like just mention the fact that you
04:06:50 like digi in that one episode if you didn't become the tbap q and a yeah the tbap q and a or you know
04:06:56 with the other guys you wouldn't have a nearly the same audience that you do now yes the pcp would
04:07:03 not have happened and so on and so forth yes so i mean it's the answer is somewhat obvious it's
04:07:11 just a manner of how to in the brody community so small i bet so i so and yeah it's easy to think
04:07:21 if define people to like you just like and and express the fact that you like them and whoops
04:07:26 today isn't your best friends now it there's it's so easy to become a big fish in a small pond
04:07:32 and stuff like that whereas when you're dealing with like the idea of comics like the the comics
04:07:38 community that ranges from so many different things it's so hard to get into quote-unquote
04:07:46 with with when you're in a fandom it's so easy to be on the same page just watch the
04:07:52 latest episode of a show read the latest update of a comic you like that you can now discuss it
04:07:57 when you're you need to be in like the comics community it's like do we have to read all
04:08:01 comics now i don't want to do that no how fucking how could you um i've been thinking about this in
04:08:10 in with respect with respect to the whole round table thing it's really it's really actually
04:08:16 pretty surreal that you like brought up the round table on this episode because i had
04:08:22 been like thinking about it personally a bunch lately um i mean i have as well since i plan to
04:08:28 go there as soon as i am able to yeah um wait pause pause no okay um
04:08:42 oh i fuck what was i talking about i lost my i lost my train oh oh i was i was thinking about like
04:08:48 i don't know you want you want to get out there into a community to like make connections
04:08:58 right and like make friends make associates people to collab with or just be or just people
04:09:05 to like that you like and you like spending time with you know i think that's what a friend is
04:09:10 supposed to be uh if i if i if i recall my uh my latin um so you know you want you want to you
04:09:18 want to get out there in the world and do all that but like specifically with regards to like
04:09:25 making connections networking um i just have listen i know this is wrong i'm just i'm just like
04:09:35 afraid to like waste my time on people that have no i i know i know how that sounds and i'm
04:09:47 i don't mean to say that like oh like i see everyone as like a potential business connection
04:09:51 and if they have nothing material to offer me then i don't want anything to do with them
04:09:54 that's not even what i mean but just in in the in the i mean look i did this podcast with low art
04:10:01 i tried to make this i tried to make this book with this audiobook with fucking oh lilia
04:10:05 they i mean low art might still come through eventually but these guys they oh lilia might
04:10:10 too if i fucking pass through him for another who knows how long but the point is you know
04:10:15 people flake on you you waste your time you you invest your time what do you get back for it
04:10:20 you know usually nothing um and i mean i guess you just gotta keep chugging away at it
04:10:27 but it's just not a very it's not it's not very exciting to me doesn't sound great i
04:10:36 i talked about this on the pcp and i and i don't want to harp on it more but it's
04:10:40 a derid rate for this conversation since it's relevant i have been craving the fandom connection
04:10:45 for a while now and it's hard to get into because i don't know what i mean by the
04:10:50 fandom connection uh sort of what i just described a moment ago where it feels like
04:10:58 i don't have any connection to people like i don't really have anything to talk about with
04:11:03 other people because my entrance art shows where it's easy to communicate with people on a forum
04:11:09 or on tumblr or on a subreddit my interests are more abstract now like for instance i don't go on
04:11:16 the homestuck subreddit because while i like homestuck they don't really interact with it in
04:11:21 the way that i want to and i don't really know if i want to spend my time in that particularly
04:11:26 but sure i i just i felt like again i think a lot of this is like nostalgia a lot of this is no
04:11:35 depth like i just want things to be the way they were before but i do think there's so you know
04:11:39 things aren't the way they were before you wouldn't even recognize me anymore not that you you know
04:11:45 what i'm doing it's linkin park lyrics munchie linkin park get fucking educated um i've never
04:11:51 seen the room anyway i uh i i think there's something real there where it's like when you're
04:11:57 a part of a community and you're a fan of something it's so easy to make connections with other fans
04:12:05 of that specific thing for instance okay like you listener you fucking you you whoever the hell you
04:12:13 are fucking a frame yeah you are specifically yeah yeah um you bedfellow card card god koonrat
04:12:22 cheeky chicken crypto coin lever dolphin boy madish rampage marco boko uh deviated dr plague
04:12:29 frame matt uh steel viper arrow it's yeah you guys uh you are what i'm talking about i think
04:12:36 a lot about this and how it relates to endless war think about how great it would be to be an
04:12:42 endless war fan you have all these people uh based around this really small community
04:12:48 and it's not a lot of people but because it's not a lot of people and it's something that you
04:12:51 care about a lot it's so easy to make connections and to make fans to make friends i hear you yeah
04:12:57 imagine how yeah yeah you know imagine being able to like endless war instead of having it
04:13:02 just be a ball and chain around your ankle you know what i mean literally yeah yeah yeah fuck yeah
04:13:08 i i feel like like i envy that a lot i really do i really envy just being able to like
04:13:15 make friends and do stuff and like i feel like i've made friends a lot with the people in here
04:13:20 this is a thing that that wraps into what i'm you know yeah when you're a fan of something
04:13:27 right you're passionate about something you want to you want to share that passion with others you
04:13:32 you want to you know the community whatever the fuck you know um i just want to say by the way
04:13:39 that i want this like just to be a fan again i want to have that because okay before i cut down my
04:13:47 discord list i was in like 30 different servers all of them combined like the amount of unique
04:13:55 users was less than 100 probably yeah like in what in what in what in what in across the
04:14:02 discord servers what i mean by that is that like i was just surrounded by the same same people over
04:14:08 and over and over again who i talk to on a daily basis but fans of the pcp i communicate exclusively
04:14:16 with people who like know all there is to know about me in a way i and who are like fans of me
04:14:23 in a way and that doesn't like i don't think that legitimizes our relationship in any way but it's
04:14:28 just well i kind of want to be anonymous in a way sometimes maybe that's a little bit of a harsh
04:14:35 statement but like i just want to like exist i mean i can be anonymous of that context i mean
04:14:40 i can be anonymous in real life anytime i want uh i don't know i think there's something to be
04:14:47 something i want to be a part of a community where the community is not about me yeah i just want
04:14:52 to be a fan of something else again and be able to meet different people i feel so stifled by the
04:14:57 pcp audience i don't want to sound ungrateful at all i don't want to sound like so i have so many
04:15:02 fans but like it is a real feel that i have or i just i want to have different connections this is
04:15:07 this is kind of related who the cheat trigger finger do i want that i think i want that do i
04:15:13 have the money for i don't know okay what you're saying it's kind of related to what i was going
04:15:17 to say but you're coming at it from like a different angle the community angle i don't
04:15:21 have a i don't feel stifled by um you know a community well okay then yeah i just want to
04:15:32 say real quick i think i think the distinction here is to be frank you have your own identity you
04:15:39 have your own content that you have a you have your own unique sort of brand i i don't have that
04:15:46 i don't i don't i don't know if i'd say that i mean i understand what you're getting at
04:15:54 it i mean is what you're saying that like your identity is more tied to the pcp specifically
04:15:59 than mine yes yeah okay well that that might be true um
04:16:05 um
04:16:10 to an extent i mean i don't think it's as dire as all that but okay whatever i go what you're
04:16:16 saying i'll at least begin um my what i was coming at it was not the the problem of like you
04:16:23 know the community or whatever whatever um my my problem is it's it's it's it's i i would kind
04:16:32 of like to be a fan again i know i get i get you but like what am i passionate about
04:16:39 and you know it i don't know if this is like narcissistic but like what i'm passionate about
04:16:44 is my stuff like to the almost to the almost to the exclusion of everything not to the exclusion
04:16:51 but like to an extent that dwarfs everything else like i used to i used to go to like parties
04:16:59 or something and i and people would be you know oh everyone's a nerd there everyone's a geek you
04:17:04 know they're all involved in the geek culture and they're all excited they were talking about like
04:17:08 you know marvel movies like talking about lord of the rings talking about stuff that they liked
04:17:15 and i mean god i don't want to sound like an elitist because i don't judge them for that
04:17:20 i don't think that they're stupid for liking those things i i'm just i'm just i can't do it
04:17:26 you know then i completely agree with you and it's the subject of much personal strike
04:17:34 yeah because i i too like i don't play video games unless it's specifically with another person
04:17:40 and i can kind of justify in the sense that like i'm doing it with another person it's a social
04:17:44 experience i don't read things television shows fucking terrifying me i could never watch like
04:17:50 two seasons of something that you're joking me every million yeah i feel i feel maybe once every
04:17:58 like a couple months maybe dude yeah okay you get it you totally get it okay no i told i totally
04:18:03 get it then when i wake up i just think okay what do i want to do with today what art do i want to
04:18:08 create today to like the absolute like complete detriment like like what have i consumed in the
04:18:14 in the last week literally could not tell you probably the same games i played a thousand times
04:18:20 together for like maybe 30 minutes i can't think of a new thing i've watched oh i recently started
04:18:27 watching you know you know this is somewhat personal by recent started watching orange is new black
04:18:31 with kazi but like i had to stop because i got literally too intimidated by sheer length and
04:18:39 i was just like i just can't watch this i i can't watch a tv show that goes on that long
04:18:46 mmm it's just it's so much time i can't do it i can't watch television shows what's like what's
04:18:52 like i can't justify it what's like this i would like to have the experience of having you know
04:19:01 having something that i'm passionate about something i'm a fan of right and then like
04:19:06 becoming like having a community centered around that thing and like you know meeting people through
04:19:17 our like shared love of this thing yeah yeah yeah and okay but i'm i'm so sort of single-mindedly
04:19:28 uh uh devoted to like my own shit to the point that it kind of hampers my ability to engage with
04:19:35 other things completely agree and i hate it and i'm i'm so much like that but like and that might
04:19:42 be fine that might be fine if but like my like for that for that to fill that community void my
04:19:50 fan base or if you want to call it my yeah like my the community centered around my
04:19:56 shit would have to be bigger and it would have to be growing faster it doesn't there's not
04:20:00 not i don't have if i had like a vast following that was like way invested in like
04:20:08 like if ever like tons and tons of people talking about like oh what's the next chapter
04:20:11 gonna be oh what's the next thing he's gonna make whatever like i'm i want to talk about it like
04:20:14 like i could probably just engage with that and it would be fine but it's not enough i don't have
04:20:19 enough of a following that that fills the void for me do you know what i mean not not at the rate
04:20:25 not at the rate at which i produce content which based on which because of the format i produce
04:20:29 content in is just not that fast i i just think about how every single day like like all i do
04:20:38 is think about what i want to create and what i like like you know i think about in this war
04:20:43 updates i can make i think about like ways i could implement it and it techniques a quick draw
04:20:47 and it's so draining in a way not like i don't want to sound ungrateful i love the fact i love my
04:20:55 fans i love the fact that i'm able to do this i'm very privileged and it's fun like i would not
04:21:00 be doing our unless it was literally just fun for me to do and i'm sure i would be doing it
04:21:05 regardless yeah it's it's just that like it's like where am i gonna find the time to do other things
04:21:14 never when am i ever going to like wake up and there's a distinction here that i want to make
04:21:21 where it's like if i'm hanging out with friends which is something that i do somewhat often but
04:21:27 by that i mean like you know i'm paying them calls with people i can sometimes you consider watching
04:21:33 something or playing something though honestly not even that often i can't think of a single
04:21:38 fucking scenario where i would be at my computer and not at least thinking about my art i might be
04:21:46 absentmindedly consuming some media like like youtube videos i find no community or any sort of like
04:21:53 like i don't feel part of like a youtuber's audience or anything like that no whatsoever
04:21:59 yeah i might be doing that but there's never a moment where like i'm seriously like watching a show
04:22:05 watching a movie reading a comic and then like i want to discuss that like i cannot imagine that
04:22:12 and it's stupid it's dumb and it's bad for my art it's stifling me creatively i feel like i'm so
04:22:19 insular just like like it's it's bad for my art it's bad for my like my mental health i think to be
04:22:26 so like i don't have that barrier of people interacting with me yeah it's just bad but i
04:22:33 can't stop all i want to do is make suffer endless war all i want to do is do that because i'm just
04:22:39 fucking dumb i guess um boy uh i'm it's not that i didn't think you would understand but i am
04:22:52 surprised at the extent to which you are articulating the way that i feel about this kind of thing
04:22:58 you know then it's time like these where i where i remember that i think i think you're my friend
04:23:03 i think that we have we have similar elves on life and that's why we talk to each other
04:23:10 is that canon is that canon though i don't know if that's i don't know i don't know i i think i
04:23:16 think i'm still gonna command my child's soldiers to destroy your child's soldiers there we go that's
04:23:20 what i thought that's what i thought the deal was but i'm glad you reminded me of the deal i wouldn't
04:23:25 by the way buy fuck energy from slime corp dot com uh buy and bulk thirty eight dollars per uh
04:23:31 four pack for some you know energy yeah from fuck city um yeah yeah oh maybe this sounds
04:23:43 fuck city anymore i i like to call it once in a while just to throw people off yeah it's like the
04:23:49 big apple that's like calling new york the big apple um uh maybe this sounds weird to people
04:23:57 like to the to the kinds of people who are listening to this right now it probably sounds weird
04:24:03 right to that okay i wonder i wonder constantly to what extent
04:24:11 what if what if like everyone what if everyone was like me what if everyone who was like
04:24:18 listening to rfck watching endless war was like me listening to penny arcade
04:24:24 shit or or or and not not even fully engaged with it on a level where i'm like i'm like this
04:24:34 but like to a large extent of my fucking brain processes is like
04:24:38 like coveting you know what i mean
04:24:46 and we're so fucking pathetic we should be wiped off the map oh no what i mean we should
04:24:52 despawn we should fucking despawn wait we are you saying we plural yeah we plural do you know what
04:24:57 i mean do you i i of course i know i just want to be here you say that i just want to be here you
04:25:04 know i i of course i i feel that i feel that way about other people completely unjustified
04:25:10 yeah i feel that i feel the way about other people in the pcp completely unjustified and i wonder
04:25:15 well i mean it makes me wonder how many people are listening to this feeling the exact same way
04:25:18 about me like like like to me hearing amy falcone say if i hadn't been on strip search my life would
04:25:25 be shit and i think i have been on rfck my life and i yeah and i think i'm living i'm living her
04:25:31 personal hell and then someone listens to this and i and and one of us says like yeah if we hadn't
04:25:36 like formed a horseshoe crew made the pcp my life would be shit and they think i'm living their
04:25:42 personal hell and this and it's just and it's just hell all the way down it's just it's just
04:25:48 hell within hell i i i want to iterate to our fans that don't mistake the meaning in any way
04:25:57 i envy you i wish i was you so badly i don't you're nothing you're nothing i i want like
04:26:07 can you imagine if i like if i found in this war and how much you would gel with me because i
04:26:14 created it sure you know well yeah like i mean i mean it's not gonna it's not going to appeal to
04:26:20 anyone as much as you or that would be like a miracle if it did yeah yeah yeah yeah it like
04:26:28 i i i can imagine this would be frustrating to people you're gonna talk i i yeah totally they
04:26:35 don't get it and i don't want to sound like i'm imagining listening i'm imagining listening to
04:26:41 like amy falcone say this kind of stuff and i'm and i would be my reaction would be
04:26:46 be fuck you you are so fucking privileged you have no idea like what what i what i wouldn't
04:26:53 what i wouldn't have given fuck what i wouldn't give to have had the opportunities that you have had
04:26:58 die i i think this kind of goes back to this is what that's a lot of things in my life i i i'm
04:27:08 really like even though it's like it's fun it's funny the fact that i feel this way i feel like
04:27:13 weirdly like a camaraderie now yeah yeah yeah i want to talk about it and i want to
04:27:19 edit it because i'm ashamed of it and i don't say i express it and i don't express it um you know
04:27:25 like this it's funny that i say it's funny that i think this about these people specifically these
04:27:30 are not like famous people these are what the fuck okay sorry i'm mimic just attack me and it's
04:27:36 sorrowing me a little bit like these like these are not like huge person amy falcone has like
04:27:40 four thousand twitch followers this is not this is not like a fucking i think that might be you what
04:27:47 maybe maybe because like it's like it's closer like it's more tantalizing and close like i don't
04:27:51 like i'm not going to think about like what if i was what if i was a Bradley Cooper what if i was
04:27:56 yeah i was gonna say ninja but like you know whatever someone same thing someone huge well yeah
04:28:02 i'm not like like oh man i could have been like um i don't know who's fucking giant i mean i don't
04:28:09 want to say pew yeah pewdiepie yeah that's right um insane should be your new intro that's right
04:28:17 you're correct uh well yeah you solved it you cracked it you know we're wondering how do you
04:28:24 grow how do you grow your audience you just say the things he says yeah that's it you just say
04:28:34 pewdiepie that's my god i got my new catchphrase it's pewdiepie subscribe oh the youtube algorithm
04:28:39 will detect that you say pewdiepie i assume that you are pewdiepie and then recommend you to all
04:28:43 pewdiepie subscribers that's how you do it that's how you do it you gotta trick the algorithm
04:28:48 it's not about it's not about making appealing content it's about tricking a computer to promote
04:28:53 you it is though for real that's true a few things in my life yeah uh just ties into me
04:29:00 wanting to streamline my time this ties into me wanting to go to college and sort of almost
04:29:07 okay i don't i don't want to sound like a drama queen i don't want to sound
04:29:12 brash but sort of rethinking the way i've led my life in a way and sort of re-questioning
04:29:18 if i want to continue my life in the way that i've been living it in a way yeah where i think
04:29:25 streamlining my content has or a streamlining like like the way i think about work is not so
04:29:31 that i can work on my art better which it is but i want to try and force myself to socialize the
04:29:41 people who don't think of me as like a person they watch on youtube you know yeah i i really
04:29:50 want to try i have not done this whatsoever this is going to be a complete failure so far of me
04:29:56 trying to streamline my my life and my work and just try and socialize in general this is one of
04:30:01 the main tenets of of the year of more which i wanted to accomplish year of more i've not
04:30:08 described this uh it sounds familiar but i don't remember what the year of more is well it is a
04:30:16 yearly theme that i've been talking to for this year that i thought up in i think February or
04:30:21 maybe january where it's uh i have a theme for the year which i'm trying to live my life by and
04:30:27 i'm trying to uh accomplish oh you're trying to live moss i'm trying to live moss um say
04:30:33 he's speaking of live live live moss one of kazi's roommates won the talk about live moss
04:30:40 scholarship and she got college for free because she because just because you live because you
04:30:44 lived moss yeah because she lived moss and she is currently living moss right now that's that's
04:30:49 cool that's pretty cool um so i live moss that's that's fucking
04:30:59 okay this is gonna sound negative and normally it would be but i don't even think it's bad in
04:31:04 this case it's a little dystopian the live the live moss college scholarship yeah yeah yeah i
04:31:11 if you look something from idiocracy it does it totally does yeah but i like it but you know
04:31:16 but rarely in a way that i like and i'm totally behind 100 yeah it's it's really sick it's really
04:31:22 fucking sick yeah i wish that i got to live my scholarship i mean of course that's that's literally
04:31:27 the only reason it exists is so that people that don't get it would wish that they did yeah increase
04:31:33 brand awareness okay but anyway i've been trying to branch out my life in a lot of different ways
04:31:39 i've taken the the the the the word more i mean a lot you've taken the pepsi challenge and you
04:31:43 want the pepsi i want to do the momo challenge and i'm failing spectacular i think i'm afraid i might
04:31:48 kill myself soon well uh okay all right we'll keep we'll keep up and you never have back
04:31:52 me did did you win the momo challenge did you survive um listen i i have i have i have i signed
04:32:03 a contract uh that's uh i'm not allowed to say i'm not allowed to reveal the nature i just you
04:32:10 know like don't don't ask me these questions don't ask me these things i'll i'll be i'll be revealed
04:32:14 in in due time uh this was one of the main things i was thinking about in february or whenever i came
04:32:19 with this and i wanted to branch out more in like art as well as in social life and before you say
04:32:26 you want to live moss just keep saying i want i wanted to live moss in a lot of different ways
04:32:31 what the fuck what oh sorry i gotta i have a familiar i have a uh sick familiar now um
04:32:38 neat what would you look like well he is his sir junkin he's a piece he's like a dirty paper bag
04:32:44 and he's currently wearing a knight's helmet and if i upgrade him i can turn him into like an
04:32:49 angelic crusader that's cool that's really cool i that okay that's my new goal okay i got him i
04:32:57 just got him a shield okay am i new giving up giving up giving up giving up yeah just give up
04:33:02 well no no i can pursue them both in parallel okay okay so i wanted to animate more i wanted to
04:33:08 animate which i'm doing and it's great and i almost you know the way tom describes things where it's
04:33:13 like 3d clicked with his brain in a way that other art memes didn't uh i feel the way about animation
04:33:18 i fucking adore it and it's great i feel that way about drawing in general that it just clicked with
04:33:24 me in a way that like i got decent at it in like like faster than i think most people do
04:33:32 and it just made like intuitive sense to me in a way that i think it does for a lot of people
04:33:36 i feel that way about animation i also want to do code more i want to illustrate i want to do all
04:33:39 these things and all the art like i had a lot of like art goals and they're all coming along
04:33:43 swimmingly but one of the goals was to branch out socially complete failure have not changed
04:33:51 for a while there i was going on reddit uh you know i was going on r slash box you know i did
04:33:56 mean i did meet some lifelong friends uh from reddit meetups fuck dammit okay okay i'm not reset
04:34:04 no we're cool cool yeah we're cool no we're good no we're good um i got sir junkin you know it's
04:34:10 fine your carol live my scholarship um okay but yeah i was saying yeah i meant i mean were you going
04:34:22 to like reddit meetups or are you just on reddit no i was just on reddit well i mean that's not
04:34:26 enough that's not good for you well i mean i literally stopped going on reddit i could not
04:34:33 like it was such a fail i couldn't even continue to go on reddit or continue to go on website
04:34:37 on websites just any yeah what do you mean you just stop what do you just stop going on
04:34:44 websites what do you what are you talking about are you are you are you smoking crack what what
04:34:48 i mean is i just stopped going on social media like one of my goals was literally just to go on
04:34:53 reddit more which i failed at well because i got bored and i didn't want to stop well that's a weird
04:35:02 goal like going on reddit is not socializing i mean i guess in a way it is but no more than like
04:35:09 being on discord i don't know i disagree because the sort of socializing that i would be doing on
04:35:18 reddit would be completely different than the one i would be doing on discord on discord as i said
04:35:23 before all of the discords i could possibly talk in are ones that i am like like i made in a way
04:35:30 that like are like fan discords of me and that would not be the case on reddit
04:35:35 oh i have i have a magic fish munchie i have a great great ben i have a no i have a magic
04:35:44 fish that will show me what's in chests this is literally a game changer okay just okay you know
04:35:50 yeah that's it okay cool um sick do i want this to be yeah so it would be way different to go on
04:36:00 on reddit and like i wanted really a part of that community the fandom feeling that we were just
04:36:05 talking about that that was my goal was to talk on reddit and try and and other social not not
04:36:11 just reddit but i this was a concert effort where i wanted to go on tumblr more i wanted to go on
04:36:15 reddit more i wanted to do more stuff like that try and go in on the chance more uh failed i don't
04:36:19 go on any of them it's out of my thing you know i if you know if you feel like that is um like
04:36:26 where you would get a sense of community that you're looking for fair enough i don't i have no
04:36:31 interest i have no interest in that um i don't i i don't i don't think that would do it for me i
04:36:36 want you know i want to like i like being on i like talking to people on discord and stuff you
04:36:44 know i want uh i don't know i don't want to talk to people on discord though is the thing
04:36:49 i mean i don't want to never do it well okay sure me neither um uh i don't know i i i also
04:36:59 i also don't think reddit is like or going on social media is the end of it this equation that
04:37:04 was sure this was like a baby step situation yeah sure um okay um so you know what i think i
04:37:10 think i just remembered i think i just realized another thing that keeps me from that has kept
04:37:16 me from going to uh the round table and that is that like in theory this is funny because i've
04:37:21 been there and like i i used to go there so i should know right like i shouldn't even have to think
04:37:25 about this but i do like in theory it is the perfect thing it is it is in in theory the the ideal
04:37:33 solution to like every problem that i have but what i just mean like like it is because it's
04:37:40 it's like a community that is centered around like creative endeavor of the kind that i am
04:37:46 you know focused on almost to distraction from everything else right so what so like
04:37:54 so what if i so what if i go and like it sucks you know what if like what if it's not it's like
04:37:58 it's not enough and i'm like oh why did i bother then what then what do i have left what do i have
04:38:03 left out after that i've exhausted all my possibilities so in a way it's almost like
04:38:09 you want to keep that option open and not capitalize on it so it always feels like
04:38:13 there is another option almost yeah actually yeah you said it you said it perfectly um
04:38:22 you gotta go you gotta go i know it's fucked up i know it's fucked up i know it's wrong
04:38:26 i know that i'm bad
04:38:33 i mean that that's why i mean it like i if i can't go like if i can't even do
04:38:43 the babyest thing in the entire world that's just find a fucking subreddit that i want to go on
04:38:49 if i can't do that then i'm like i've just basically embraced the fact that i'm going to die alone
04:38:54 that's the only thing that can be derived from this yeah yeah naturally naturally um well
04:39:03 what's the solution is there a solution do we even want to solve this is this even a problem
04:39:12 nobody knows nobody knows i i've been thinking about how i've taken it for granted that my life
04:39:22 i will have a picture on i will be an online creator that's just what i will do like why even
04:39:29 analyze it but more and more i've i've found the idea of having a job that's not like a
04:39:38 office job one that pertains my interest ones that may maybe you know oh working in the arts as a
04:39:44 uh but having like a clock out time having just your job be well your job not your
04:39:52 fucking life as it is for me uh that consumes every waking moment of your entire being
04:39:59 yeah just having something that you can just go to and then come home from well not wanting to
04:40:03 die while you're there well that's pretty appealing okay kind of but like
04:40:09 but then like i mean the yeah when you when you say it like that when you say like that it
04:40:19 sounds pretty good but like second like what are you actually doing there like is what you
04:40:25 are doing there something you actually want to do or that you derive meaning from i i understand
04:40:32 and maybe i'm really young and i don't yeah i would have to like see for myself
04:40:38 but thinking about it thinking about it critically i thought about like me personally
04:40:43 and what i derive pleasure from and i've said this i've said this before where it's like what
04:40:48 i enjoy about the work that i do is a lot of the time like the busy stuff i'm talking about art
04:40:54 specifically where it's like i don't know if i particularly there's a few comics that i
04:41:00 would like to do in my life but that don't really call to me like narratives don't really call to me
04:41:06 in the same way the drawing the drawing itself the drawing itself yeah that's what i care about
04:41:12 the most and i can understand that i don't know if i am entirely in the same boat but i get it
04:41:19 you know okay so i feel like i am in a unique situation where it's like i don't really like
04:41:24 as long as like just am drawing for whatever purpose i may be or am animating or you know just
04:41:31 as long as i'm working visually i don't i think that i would be fulfilled i don't know i don't
04:41:37 know if i would be completely fulfilled creatively but i would have a job that i wouldn't hate and i
04:41:41 would have off time to sometimes do my creative work or just live my life and be able to actually
04:41:45 watch a television show you know i'm gonna i don't know if this is walking back i'm not
04:41:56 fuck no no no what i don't know why i didn't just die i don't know i don't know i don't know i also
04:42:04 want to say by the way that i'm not computing internet creative work or even saying that i will
04:42:11 not it's i'm simply saying it's appealed to me more than it has before in my past i mean i have
04:42:17 been thinking it's it's it's creative like doing creative work on the internet is in my life it like
04:42:22 is in my blood i've done it my entire life it's something that i stop i don't think you know uh
04:42:27 he totally um i mean like hippo right like hippo's fucking big boy job i fucking i covet hippo so
04:42:35 yeah i love it him hippo's big boy job or approximation thereof you know has made me think
04:42:41 and i've thought like i mean you know what i was saying before about like jobs lettering jobs
04:42:48 like inking like those don't exist those can't possibly be real like what like what are you talking
04:42:55 about um that is a gun i don't want it okay i thought you were referring to the jobs like
04:43:04 that's a gun that's that's just impossible no i mean i mean like but it can't be true right
04:43:11 like i am a god i have skills i have skills that are not like totally fucking worthless
04:43:21 right sh i mean i don't know i guess i guess any feel that i might like i don't know the
04:43:27 pokey the point is i've been thinking every every once in a while i think about like what if i like
04:43:32 what if i like what kind of a job even could i get like i would i would be fine to you know
04:43:40 to an extent i would i would be okay i would be okay doing creative work for an employer
04:43:47 as long as like the hours were reasonable um and all that shit um
04:43:56 i mean i've never had a job like that before i'd like to try it at least like maybe it would be
04:44:00 great you know maybe it would provide structure or whatever to my fucking waystoy lifestyle
04:44:07 who knows i crave i crave structure like i i i crave structure right now well i've been thinking about it
04:44:15 and i guess i'm just like um but how would i oh my god i got the pig i got pig i got pig
04:44:22 you don't understand you don't understand about pig bitty you don't understand it from my perspective
04:44:27 when you're just talking and then like yeah so this really serious thing happened oh my god
04:44:31 the fucking squiggly dude i got the pig activate my bingity bomb do i got a pig this is a game changer
04:44:37 just like last time this is a absolute game changer um i think i want this armor please
04:44:45 okay look it's a pig it's a pig it's a pig deal that's all i'm saying um
04:44:50 um
04:44:52 what the fuck was i talking about i got really distracted by the pig that's all um
04:45:00 do you do you remember do you remember what i was talking about um i i got
04:45:05 distracted by the pig you just saying the pig oh was i saying oh is this the thing i was talking
04:45:09 about like hippo's job big boy job maybe it maybe it would provide so oh yeah like lettering but how
04:45:15 would i even how would i even go about getting a job like that like like with hippo like i feel like
04:45:23 well a fan of his just just so happened to be like one of those people and like yeah just like
04:45:29 offered him a job that's what i think happened hippo feel free to clarify if it's if it was more
04:45:35 and and that's also i want to just say that's not like a like a judgment on him that like oh
04:45:42 just one of his fans just also if you're listening if you to that to that person uh hi uh thanks
04:45:49 no no no that's not me that's what i'm saying is hi no shut up just call me call me my my
04:45:54 no that's no i was saying hi because um she patron me again like like last month and thanks
04:46:01 it since since we're talking about her yeah well yeah that too sure well actually actually i asked
04:46:07 hippo no after me a job please well listen this is when you'll be interested i asked hippo like
04:46:12 i mean are they hiring i that's interesting and he said uh you probably have to move to
04:46:17 london and i was like oh damn but uh so there you go um how much is living in london probably a lot
04:46:29 i mean how much is living i mean uh i don't know i mean it's probably it's probably a little more
04:46:39 than living where i live now not probably not by too much but anyway you know whatever it's not
04:46:45 important um the important part is like i have thought that maybe like you know i've got like a
04:46:54 a not insubstantial internet following right based off of my art and creativity and i thought like
04:47:02 well maybe you know that being the case i'm sure that would be like a strong like foot in the door
04:47:07 like i'm sure that would be like a good thing and maybe help me but i i have like not recently but
04:47:14 in the past i have gone onto like craigslist and stuff and just look for like you know creative
04:47:18 jobs and just be like oh why not and like send out applications like let's just see what happens
04:47:22 it has never borne fruit or even come even close or even like nothing has ever materialized or even
04:47:28 looked like it could materialize from it and i don't know what the fucking problem is um and by
04:47:34 is i mean was because this isn't the thing i've done recently at all sure and and i don't know
04:47:40 what to think about that um it makes me think that maybe everything that i've spent my time doing is
04:47:47 totally inapplicable to any other field of work and if i ever wanted to get a more traditional
04:47:52 job then it's impossible and and and it's just not just not not with how i've spent my life uh i
04:47:59 don't think that could that can't be true uh but it feels like it is
04:48:09 what a fucking bummer yeah sorry uh no no not you just the just the whole just life just the
04:48:16 way the life is well yeah i'm true um i mean you know i i i guess i don't know maybe maybe i'm wrong
04:48:30 and um because yeah i have been thinking about this i have been thinking about like what could i
04:48:36 i mean you know thank you to patrons like i really i appreciate so much everyone who
04:48:41 patrons me but you know i mean in terms of like living off of like like the money that i make
04:48:48 from patreon is it's a it's it's a meager amount to like live off of and i like we all know this
04:48:55 this is obvious this isn't gonna blow anyone's minds um as i say this um so i've been thinking
04:49:01 about like well what if i what kind what kind of a real job what kind of a real ish job would be
04:49:06 palatable to me right because i just don't want to fucking you know pound the pain i don't want to
04:49:13 look back on my this is a cliche but i'll use it i don't want to look back on my deathbed and be like
04:49:18 wow look how many years i spent doing some stupid shit that i didn't care about you know that's
04:49:23 that's fucking horrifying to me um and that's what a job is right i mean you trade your time for your
04:49:30 money you trade your time you spend doing some shit that you don't want to do but maybe someone
04:49:34 else wants you to do it and they give you some money if you if you do that you make that sacrifice
04:49:39 fair enough you know i get it um but it's a it's a fucking you know it's a shame
04:49:48 you know okay i want to give voice to what i think people could be thinking right now
04:49:54 and and like to play devil's advocate a little bit to what we're kind of expressing right here
04:50:01 and uh for some reason when i'm imagining someone constructing this argument which i'm about to
04:50:04 relay i imagine it's just Nate for some reason yeah uh i just imagine the Nate will say something
04:50:09 which i kind of agree with in a way where it's like okay we've been talking a lot about productive
04:50:15 talking a lot about how we don't have time for anything else and it's just us doing our art
04:50:20 and i think that someone could say well you say that but is that true yeah how much art do you
04:50:29 really put out dude yeah like are you really spending every waking moment just
04:50:37 you know you're completely just absorbed with your art and you know what you show for it well
04:50:43 that's not like yeah yeah i i can definitely see someone thinking that that's not what i'm saying
04:50:48 that's not what i'm saying yeah i don't think yeah because it's not i mean i mean look i mean only
04:50:58 recently have i really got back into the swing of drawing again and that's on me and it's to my
04:51:03 eternal shame um and so and so on and so forth um what i don't know uh die die die die die die
04:51:15 okay okay um yes eternal was i saying about eternal shame um that you haven't been drawing
04:51:24 yeah yeah and i'm and i'm only now kind of recovering i just want to add on to that yeah
04:51:29 that like like we've been saying that we don't have to make time for other things in our lives
04:51:33 but like and this people could say that they could see that like or say that like you know
04:51:37 we aren't producing you like unbelievable like homesick levels of art surely you can make time
04:51:43 and this is in your hands and like you know it's your fault and you can be better yeah yeah i know
04:51:48 yeah i hate myself yeah yeah obviously like obviously yeah this is our fault naturally
04:51:54 no 100% agree um the thing is you know because now a lot of this a lot of this past like
04:52:03 while or so you know there were times when i was it wasn't on comics there were times i was productive
04:52:06 on endless war there were other times when i was kind of fucking up and was not productive maybe
04:52:10 those times i would have been better off working a job uh maybe maybe i would have more to show for
04:52:15 it in the long run possible whatever um yeah the point is right it's not it's not that i'm
04:52:24 it's not that anyone is just working 24 hours a day it's just like drawing 24 hours a day
04:52:30 writing 24 hours a day i don't think i mean maybe andrew hussey did that maybe he maybe he could
04:52:36 manage that for a while um but you know it's it's it's it's it's in your brain it's in your mind
04:52:46 it's that you're you're thinking about it and even when you're not doing it you're thinking i could
04:52:49 be doing it and it eats you up inside i think something that's very hard for people who aren't
04:52:55 in our work to like conceptualize yeah especially if you're working exclusively a wage job yeah like
04:53:02 when you clock out of work you're done with work for the day you go home and you you you
04:53:08 snuggle with your wife and your children and you watch tv um when you do what us you're never
04:53:16 clocked out yeah because there is no schedule there is no like a time you're working and time
04:53:22 you're not working there's just time you should be working and it's 100 of the clock it's time
04:53:28 you should be working and time you are working yeah and i can't i can't maintain uh i can't
04:53:34 maintain focus on on creative stuff uh you know 24 hours a day i don't think anyone can uh
04:53:43 um where are we going with this uh just fucking bitching and moaning yeah um
04:53:51 someone give me a job but like a good job like an easy job that's fun friend makes a lot of money
04:53:58 again yeah that was the plan all your caro rfck
04:54:08 we got we got it we got to live moss and that's what i'm gonna do a realistic scenario
04:54:13 you're walking down the street and uh a little dog comes up to you but it's gross gross i fucking
04:54:18 kill it it's not just any dog it's the owner of millie your picnic and he says your caro

04:54:31 do i say fucking talk talk talk to my agent i say how much you got on here what'd you say
04:54:45 yeah i don't like it no i don't i don't like this i don't like the scenario i don't like the
04:54:50 slide of questioning i don't yeah i don't like it i don't like the base your base assumptions um
04:54:56 okay well that thanks for your question that's all the time we have for today five
04:55:05 yeah exactly um all right ben all right here's the idea all right yeah you hold the news i hold
04:55:12 the gun and then we let go at the same time wait so what do they die of and wait nothing
04:55:20 we just put down our arms and live a happy prosperous life we just lay down the weapons
04:55:23 and who are we who's news who's gone who are we our own our own now there's no that's interesting
04:55:33 are you wait are you saying there's a way out i never i never thought i can fuck i can escape
04:55:40 there's always my way out i say mimicking of the haunted house from disneyland what put down the
04:55:47 fucking crack pipe excuse me why can't i been literally why can't i just like steven universe
04:55:58 like all of it and just be like super into steven universe i'll tell you go on tumblr and then
04:56:03 like just talk about how much i love steven universe i will oh that's a good one oh yeah heavy
04:56:10 bullets yeah oh yeah steven universe no listen i will tell you why there's a good reason um
04:56:17 it's because it's not gay enough yeah i think i've talked about this on the pcp yeah uh um
04:56:25 steven universe gets away with having its cake and eating it too by being quote unquote about
04:56:30 lesbians but with all these qualifiers that make it like not really like they're aliens
04:56:37 they're not they don't even have bodies there aren't any men in their species like that's it's
04:56:44 bullshit i hear people say that it's no it's not it's a weak shit it's it's clear like it's
04:56:51 cleared that like those are things about them that don't like are you trying to say that like
04:56:57 they are gyms are not female presenting and like oh they're like they're exactly bodies of light so
04:57:02 like oh like oh they're not actually female like no no i mean of course they're female presenting
04:57:08 obviously but like none of them aren't so what does it mean for them to be quote unquote gay
04:57:15 it doesn't mean anything because there's no alternative it but the reason people want
04:57:24 well a reason a lot of people want representation is so that it's normalized in our society
04:57:29 not so that it can necessarily explore those themes in the show itself but just so that
04:57:36 people can see yeah they are gay or lesbian or whatever they can see themselves in just
04:57:41 represented in media whatsoever yeah so so while they might not be dealing with the same backlash
04:57:48 that a real lesbian real lesbian couples would doesn't mean that it's not impactful i mean like
04:57:53 we recognize them as you know as humans do just because they aren't like technically a gender
04:58:01 doesn't mean that we don't recognize them as such you know that's a that's a good point
04:58:07 that's a good point you make there i'll i'll buy that mm i mean five million nine please
04:58:13 i'll i'll yeah i'll i'll fucking i'll fucking count out of your sgw agenda that that'll be that'll
04:58:20 be one rip of jewel please no no no no no no my pod my pod is oh god my pod's almost empty

04:58:55 well he kept talking to me stuff he told me stuff about the jq and about how we
04:58:59 should solve it i just thought he started making a lot of sense and i felt like he should
04:59:02 continue on without me mm yeah he you know grievous had a lot of good ideas not saying
04:59:08 everything he did was right but he had he had a lot of good ideas oh general grievous is so killer
04:59:15 and also a nazi oh oh dude okay are okay are the nazis rather or the or the nazi is a killer oh i
04:59:21 think they're totally killer yeah definitely 100 100 look at them well yeah they're fashion sense

04:59:41 patreon.com slash that's insane all right you know what
04:59:48 mm-hmm what do you think i feel i've taken away from this conversation yeah you know
04:59:55 i sort of feel like even though like there's been nothing said that's convinced me we've
05:00:00 talked for a long time and said basically nothing yeah yeah yeah um there's nothing that's like
05:00:08 convinced me of this so i don't know why i feel this way specifically maybe just i've like i've
05:00:14 talked and therefore my brain has worked it out itself yeah i sort of feel like
05:00:19 i should just stop doing all the stupid things i'm doing only do things i really care about yeah
05:00:28 what yeah yeah stop doing the things i'm just doing smart things in this war and then just like it's
05:00:33 like like that's almost it basically and then just double down on the other thing they want to and
05:00:38 that's just draw yeah i should just do i should just fucking like stop spread myself even a little
05:00:43 bit thin and just completely fucking like hammer down on like trying to network trying to push
05:00:50 this art aspect of me and just do that yeah missions just do that sure harm you feel that's
05:00:57 that way uh doesn't sound like uh that's doesn't sound too wacky um i'm i'm fighting a giant snake
05:01:05 by the way um so i'm a little distracted um and really really important that i not take any damage
05:01:11 here like it in real life you're doing this yeah oh god oh god oh god the snake is a symbolism for
05:01:19 his uh sense of regret for not being on penny arcade i did it i fucking did it i killed the
05:01:25 ammo i got no damage um why am i oh god i must have failed to get the health upgrade in the first
05:01:32 buck okay that sucks something's gotta change something if i don't change something because
05:01:39 of this conversation yeah i'm just retarded i'm just i just like even if i've articulated it with
05:01:44 someone else something's gotta fucking change or else i'm just gonna kill myself one day
05:01:51 yeah i hear you actually have you ever been like actually suicidal like actually for real
05:01:56 um not really why yeah well just wondering because i have been and it's like it's like
05:02:05 sort of weird it's hard to explain because it's suicide is like stupid yeah that's what feels
05:02:10 like oh people who want to commit suicide just like what's you know even what's going on with
05:02:13 them but like it's a weirdly like i have been i have been weird at the moment it doesn't feel like
05:02:18 when you're when you're in that mindset it's just like yeah you know like if i was dead i wouldn't
05:02:24 feel bad so like if i don't want to feel bad like maybe i should just kill myself sure you know i mean
05:02:30 it's logical in a sense right uh there's a certain certain logic behind it i mean i've been depressed
05:02:37 to the point that i've been like man i should probably like be dead that would probably be better
05:02:44 i've been i but i've never been like to the point that i'm like seriously considering doing anything
05:02:51 about it you know i mean i almost jumped out of a car once i was about to but literally my mom held
05:02:56 on like like like grabbed me and because she was way bigger than i was she was able to well
05:03:01 well no no no i i that that that was i don't know why i said she was way bigger than me because
05:03:06 that wasn't the case but just just because she would like held on to me with a vice grip i didn't
05:03:10 uh that's the good stuff that's the good stuff right there and i continue to live morse ever
05:03:19 since yes ever so yeah i you you all that on that on that day you almost lived manos
05:03:33 whoo what what what about endless war uh what what even what even is that what what is it a text

05:06:10 but this time you okay no irano no irony here feeling real good about this run because i have
05:06:17 the pig um and yeah that's pretty much it i have the pig ah god bless i got the pig and i'm just
05:06:26 looking for rats i'm just looking for rats baby um um hey well let me pivot okay now sure i have um
05:06:35 been thinking and mulling over right i've been fucking for some reason honestly i think it was
05:06:43 just a lack of a lack of healthy alternatives i started falling down this like dnd podcast um root
05:06:51 you know sitting there and and and you know sitting there and just coveting right and coveting
05:06:57 this lifestyle and oh fuck fell down a hole sorry what
05:07:05 wait oh my god the fish saves me the fish saved me munchie the fish i have the fish
05:07:13 everything it's gonna be okay i got the fish and the pig and it's made all the difference
05:07:16 okay okay look got the toad all right so um i mean coveting this lifestyle and and i keep
05:07:24 bringing me keeps bringing me back to thinking like how can i do this right i keep having the
05:07:28 idea of how do i run like a game oh i want to play in a game i want to be one of these people
05:07:33 i want to play in a game and and have that be content that people consume watch me play in a
05:07:37 fucking game watch me have a character run through a story tell a great story have a great time very
05:07:42 entertaining um you know i mean no one's gonna do that that's not gonna happen the only alternative
05:07:48 is that i have to run one and that's a nightmare but maybe i maybe i'm so desperate that i'll do it
05:07:54 anyway and um i mean that's what it is that's a that's a healthy way to view yourself i mean
05:08:03 like i'm so desperate i'll do a thing that i know isn't a good idea just for a sad just for a
05:08:10 taste just for a taste of the reflective glory um i don't know you know i propose i propose doing
05:08:18 one set an endless war that's a maybe i was thinking i was i was actually thinking about um
05:08:25 like the other day i had a i had an idea i actually really liked it and i mulled it over
05:08:29 like for the rest of the night while i was doing other stuff i think i might run like i could i
05:08:33 could run like a game i could run a game set in the champion world i actually think i could i
05:08:38 i actually thought of like oh i have an idea for a story like i have i i have like a concept for
05:08:44 like a story that would take place there and it would be like it would fit cleanly into like a
05:08:49 one-shot thing it has like a thing behind it the thing is i don't know any i don't know if people
05:08:56 that play these games right like like if i got like maybe you or hippo right to be in this thing
05:09:02 with me like you guys to have like it would be weird you'd never played it before and it would
05:09:07 be weird to have it be like your first exposure to it and i thought maybe i could have maybe i
05:09:12 could come up with like a more like like a more simplified like sort of rules light variant do
05:09:17 i really want to fucking spend the time like coming up with a whole system for this or like
05:09:23 maybe i could find a simpler system and also it could be like it's like yeah like me and hippo
05:09:30 are in it but like doesn't that just mean like it's the same audience that you would have already
05:09:34 in a way it does it does mean that um i mean i wouldn't i mean it would work like because
05:09:43 i have like a story idea for it it would work for it could work regardless honestly it might
05:09:49 play out differently depending on who else was there but like it could work with anyone um it
05:09:54 would be fine um honestly i mean this isn't even like this isn't an audience building thing this is
05:10:00 a this is like a man i know i was just i was talking earlier about how it's a bad bad thing
05:10:08 to like diversify and not just focus on one medium but at the same time i like i like being a
05:10:14 diverse i like that's why we do it that's why we do it i like being multimedia i like the idea
05:10:20 i like the idea that like like i mean man i almost never even think about the fact that
05:10:25 i made a whole fucking game for the champion like yeah that almost never even crosses my mind and
05:10:31 yet it is an indisputable fact of some importance i think probably um oh that's a fucking stupid item
05:10:39 but you know what i want it anyway um okay so i don't know i like the idea that like the story
05:10:48 could would be a multimedia thing like there would be you know a game there'd be comics there'd be
05:10:53 these fucking like rpg like tabletop games like set in the universe um that stuff's really cool to
05:11:02 me and i really like it um it's super cool yeah that there just is a video game for this comic
05:11:12 yeah like that's undeniably great and cool i'm very proud of it it's and i actually made it really
05:11:18 fast like that's a weird thing about it is i actually it only took me like three weeks to make it
05:11:27 like like maybe less i okay another thing i want to i want to mention um okay two things actually
05:11:36 number one i was just a broad thing i feel like no matter what even if it's not a
05:11:41 thorough podcast to ever there's always just gonna be stuff in your brain that you can't
05:11:45 articulate it and like there's always some like asterisk to everything you say in a way
05:11:49 where it's like you could always like articulate your point it's like a little bit better and then
05:11:54 like if you when you don't someone's gonna comment it um you mean are you talking about this like
05:12:00 game idea thing or are you talking about no no no i'm talking about in general i'm talking about
05:12:05 in general okay not i'm saying i'm talking about like like me like right now during this conversation
05:12:11 we're having right now sure sure yeah yeah yeah um where it's like like you know there's there's
05:12:17 things i'll say which might to some people require context for them to fully understand
05:12:22 where i'm coming from in a way but just i can't think to do that for every single thing or else
05:12:27 i would just be talking for an hour and saying not really anything just explaining everything
05:12:31 that i'm thinking and all the all the nuances that i'm sort of leaving out to save time so that
05:12:37 that i feel like you can already respond to so one thing i i want to mention one nuance and
05:12:43 clarification i would like to say that like i don't think that like uh like that like being good
05:12:52 is bad for business uh and i feel like people can like say that like all you do for instance like
05:13:02 on youtube is follow the algorithm and feed the algorithm and that's like if you just do that
05:13:08 well you have to you you do that but you like i mean you have to be confident at it right like
05:13:15 yeah you need well yeah you i mean you need a certain base level competency and some people
05:13:20 don't have it but it's not that uncommon either like you know lots of people could oh god i almost
05:13:28 okay um like lots of people could um do it you know not everyone but a lot of people
05:13:35 and that's probably why it seems not special just some you know it it's also like i i think that
05:13:43 there are things that exist that are successful maybe not as successful as someone who is competent
05:13:49 slash either good maybe who is strictly trying to follow the algorithm and just is doing that
05:13:54 specifically and like with intentionally to get paid but there are definitely people who are good
05:14:00 who've succeeded on the back of just being good and there are people there are you know fine success
05:14:08 so i don't i just want to clarify that that is possible and i don't think i think we can it's
05:14:12 easy to get wrapped up and just like oh like like like you know i want to all these things which are
05:14:17 good like you know but like i there's not worth it business wise um i think that is
05:14:24 like it's not that that's wrong i don't think either of those thinkings are wrong that just
05:14:29 like you should just like follow the algorithm on you or something and be a bit competent and you
05:14:33 can do it i also don't think that if you wanted to it's impossible for you to not follow the
05:14:38 algorithm we'll still make quality content and making stuff that people want and like there's
05:14:43 no way to get popular that way well i don't know i just think it's it's harder in some senses and
05:14:48 that's what we're discussing currently well it's like i think yeah i mean i mean i mean if you're
05:14:54 finding okay go on go on i would find it very plausible that there's some like maybe making
05:15:02 that game was not like entirely like the best use of your time in a way that like um well i don't know
05:15:11 yeah cranky now like like uh like uh like like you know a lot of pages i mean the game
05:15:16 theoretically made me zero money yeah exactly and and honestly it probably literally made me zero
05:15:23 money because like nobody talks about it like after it came out like nobody talked about it
05:15:29 and i don't know of anyone who was like wow i saw that game you made and i was really impressed
05:15:36 and like i i check out all your other stuff because that that might be true for this but
05:15:42 this sort of thing in general that's like not strictly for business but you do because you have
05:15:47 a spark of inspiration and you think it's good you think it's a quality idea and it's just creatively
05:15:52 fulfilling i think that thing can feel it can like work just in a business sense of it being like
05:16:01 part of why people like you is that you create content which they enjoy and i think it's i it's
05:16:09 often like almost understated in a way that the masses aren't like stupid they like good things
05:16:18 and when you create stuff of quality they enjoy it often yeah so well maybe that video game in
05:16:27 specific did not generate you money and i'm not complaining and i'm not complaining about that
05:16:32 yeah i think we mix together like stuff like that and maybe endless war which we've said before is
05:16:39 not really made us a lot of money almost at all in the sense uh like i still think that just is
05:16:47 good to do because people will like you more and people will be more often to support you
05:16:53 oh no i'm please please please please yes ah okay i just i was terrified because i realized
05:17:03 i was out of blanks and i need two blanks to get to the rat's nest uh but luckily the store
05:17:08 had some so we're good don't worry about it okay sorry to interrupt you but well no no hold on
05:17:14 also by the way i just want to say that you've said this before but i didn't notice and i thought
05:17:20 you were exaggerating but now like really paying attention to every single panel the halftones
05:17:25 and the vapors is like ridiculous in chapter one the halftone in oh sure sure you mean the dots
05:17:34 yeah the dots yeah you mean the dots what is the halftone yeah um uh it is yeah it is very i was very
05:17:43 meticulous about it too meticulous in fact yeah yeah you know with with vapors one with
05:17:50 vapors one in specific i was very focused on the idea of like replicating the look of a print
05:17:56 comic i used the halftones because they are very print comic e uh in two and now in three i mean
05:18:03 i didn't stop using them but i definitely use them less and i only use them in cases where i
05:18:07 thought they were necessary um there were a couple of shots like the one of vincent like coming
05:18:14 through the door dramatically that looked like the halftones and that looked really cool i literally
05:18:19 as you say that i was i'm looking at it yeah that that's that one's really good um and sometimes
05:18:24 halftones are good but like generally i'm fine with just using like you know gray because like
05:18:29 yeah like the format that i printed can print gray like the reason they had halftones is because
05:18:34 they couldn't print in gray back in the day well you know i can so whatever um yeah um
05:18:43 oh no now i feel now i feel bad now i feel like maybe i should use maybe i should use
05:18:47 more halftones maybe i abandoned something that was important and added value to my work
05:18:53 law i don't know um you were gonna say something i cut you off was i i mean wasn't i just mad
05:19:00 because i had thought that i didn't have blanks to find the rats nest no we were talking oh god
05:19:07 i'm retarded i forget what we were talking about but you were definitely gonna say something
05:19:11 and we're gonna be oh oh we were talking about um how just like inspiring goodwill by creating
05:19:16 quality content is a method to but that is not like inherently goes against the idea of doing
05:19:23 something for a business purpose where it's like doing something that's good for business
05:19:27 core code is described is not necessarily mean just like gaming things or like like
05:19:32 cynically i mean that's that's what go ahead and yeah i mean that's what i always wanted to do
05:19:39 right i wanted to be like okay i'm not i don't want to be like super commercial i don't want to
05:19:48 make shit i don't i don't want to make shit because the algorithm favors it uh you know i just want
05:19:53 to make cool stuff and if i just work really hard and make cool stuff people will see it
05:19:59 i'll see that it's good and you know just sort of naturally you know by just just by on the backs
05:20:06 of the quality of the shit that i make people will find it and appreciate it and that has happened
05:20:14 to extend yeah uh you know not not i mean i'm very poor right so so that's you know but that's
05:20:28 not necessarily a failing of the ideology um that's not that's not a what am i trying to say
05:20:39 okay what am i she helped um blah blah blah live moss um yeah yeah yeah strip search um brood god
05:20:49 is is that is that ben sain in the flesh is that really by the way also looking at vapor's one
05:20:58 right now by the way i've realized that like the way you draw magda while she's in her i don't know
05:21:02 how you describe her her grim bark her grim dark state yeah sure um is literally the way i draw you
05:21:09 in r of ck are which i didn't even realize it look at this literally it's the exact same classes i
05:21:17 did not even notice yeah that's that's a little bit ridiculous it's a little bit weird but that is
05:21:25 the case really funny that's really cool i love it i love it um um i i i get what you mean it like
05:21:36 it's uh i i mean i think the goal is always to just do what you find creatively fulfilling
05:21:48 and if you could do only that and be successful like like no one like okay me and you said this
05:21:54 a thousand times before our goal is not to become the richest people on earth oh that would be a nice
05:21:59 spiritual outcome slash ben sain uh yeah it's i mean it's it's it's about doing what you want
05:22:06 well here's i mean pop it's about it's just about being a guy you want to be not for like
05:22:11 strictly a monetary sense but just in the sense that you want to be able to make your art and not
05:22:16 have to do shit that you don't want to i mean here's my i mean i've said i've said this before
05:22:21 this is sort of my philosophy if i were rich um what i would do with that is i would use the
05:22:33 fact that i don't have to work anymore to just like work on my shit that's what i would do with a lot
05:22:39 of money maybe if i had a whole lot of money i would like hire assistants right maybe maybe that
05:22:45 could help you know grease grease the pipeline yeah yeah that's that's all i would use it for
05:22:51 um uh maybe and if i were famous if i were super popular all i would do with that is
05:23:00 use it to make money so that i could do what i just said i would do with a lot of money
05:23:04 uh yeah ben yeah hmm how do i say this okay your god question mark i'm i'm on i'm on saint
05:23:15 tomlicks.com right now right now which you can too viewer if you click the link in the description
05:23:21 right um these these are genius what are you talking about these why are you talking about
05:23:29 these comics that's bullshit no man i suck remember no you do suck because you make
05:23:37 fucking Winnie the Pooh videos yeah you make you make youtube videos to be fair i was kind of
05:23:43 interested i was kind of personally interested in in like no sure okay no okay in Winnie the Pooh
05:23:49 i'm i'm personally a big Winnie the i'm personally a big Pooh head um it okay there's like a
05:23:57 weird disconnect in my head like like i said this before like i asked you if you felt this way
05:24:01 sort of like in like an abstract like questioning just like sort of um you know do you feel like
05:24:05 ben the saint the comic guy and ben saint the the twitch stream or whatever i just can't people
05:24:10 and i didn't really like like i didn't really notice but i feel that way i don't really often
05:24:17 think about like how i'm friends with ben and you have created the vapors it seems like
05:24:25 the vapors ben couldn't have made the vapors yeah right the vapors is the best thing ever made
05:24:30 no come on now you just yank me you just yanking me no okay you crank yanking me
05:24:38 also it's really cool it's but like i mean i don't think about you that way i mean you know
05:24:44 you know i don't think about myself that way enough and that's that's my problem that's one of my many
05:24:50 problems um and like oh okay i fell into a hole but it's fine um one of the things that i want to
05:24:58 do you know i want to i just you know i spread myself thin and it wasn't even just about you
05:25:04 know i just got out of the mindset right like it's about you know you know the secret is
05:25:08 bullshit obviously but like there's something to be said about like visualizing you know what you
05:25:13 want to see and then like and having it come as a as a consequence of that like just by virtue of the
05:25:21 fact that if you're focused on it you will sort of naturally take action to bring about that
05:25:26 reality and you know when i'm thinking about streaming when i'm thinking about you know
05:25:31 fucking editing doing fancy editing on the latest pcp when i'm thinking about you know making 10
05:25:36 paces draw like really good i'm not thinking about yeah being a comic sky getting my comic
05:25:41 sun getting my yeah work done yeah yeah yeah um uh the the it's such a it's such a because it's not
05:25:49 like okay well okay i'm gonna speak i'm gonna speak like like strictly as i want to say a viewer
05:25:55 i want i want to say this to the view okay no go on okay to the viewer i'm sorry i found it okay
05:26:00 i have been running around the same level like everywhere just looking for the hatch that leads
05:26:05 to the rat's nest and it took me forever but i finally found it so okay uh disaster inverted
05:26:10 okay what are you saying um i just want to say for like i'm strictly thinking as like a fan of
05:26:15 bin saying like i wouldn't say that like just like just only do comics now because like i like when
05:26:22 you do other stuff yeah it's just it's like it's kind of like like you're just fucked like no matter
05:26:30 what you do uh just die in a way it's like i guess like i like the vapors more than other
05:26:38 thing everything else you do but like it's almost like again like i don't i can't recognize out of
05:26:43 the fact in my mind that you've created the vapors i don't i don't get i don't what are you getting
05:26:50 at now i'm getting at i'm getting at that like i like i i don't even like when i think about you
05:26:57 i don't think about the vapors at all really in a way i see um so it's it's almost like i can't
05:27:04 even imagine a world where the vapors or you know any video comics are like the main thing you do
05:27:10 even though i think that would be like the best in certain aspects
05:27:17 like i just can't imagine it this is the thing there's no what's what's the elevator pitch for
05:27:22 ben saying there isn't one yeah it's like 14 different things oh god oh god oh god um i just
05:27:28 a bad room i got a bad room uh there's a there's a demon the grim raper is here
05:27:37 the grim raper is here that's it fuck part part of me thinks that like i like like like as as like um
05:27:46 i guess like as like like a backseat a comics artist in a way like a backseat gamer but like a
05:27:52 backseat uh just like fan of you if i were you i would double down on comics and just try and
05:28:00 throw myself into that community and just kind of focus on that just because i don't know
05:28:04 that seems to be what i like the most of you but like but like i mean i think that's the most
05:28:12 unique i think that's the most unique thing about me definitely the most unique definitely
05:28:17 but like like would i like with that like would i say like you know like i'm comfortable never
05:28:24 seeing another uh like another twitter like ben stream again i'm comfortable never seeing
05:28:28 like stuff like that or his appearances on on pcp or just anything else like that like no no no
05:28:34 no yeah that would be that would be a big loss yeah it would i i think so definitely i don't
05:28:41 want to do i don't want to do nothing but like i don't really want to be someone who does nothing
05:28:47 but you know whatever thing i don't i mean that sounds boring definitely maybe that's maybe that's
05:28:56 my problem maybe that maybe that's my problem and maybe if i were cool for example i would be like
05:29:03 i would be totally okay with yeah i'm just gonna sit in my room i'm just gonna do nothing but draw
05:29:07 forever you know i mean that's how people get i mean that's how people succeed as artists is
05:29:12 they fucking do nothing but it and they become super good at it and they're prolific and they
05:29:16 just put out a ton of shit fuck damn it oh i've got just fighting some orbs just fighting some
05:29:23 real nasty orbs right now um um what's the solution i don't know yep yeah yeah agreed
05:29:37 what a fucking what a shit show fuck shit i say it nothing in particular yeah um

05:29:59 to go through a yes got it okay you have to go through a specific oh but i lost all my armor
05:30:06 oh that sucks you have to go through a specific like sequence of uh like runes that is unique
05:30:12 to every game and uh i just you know okay there was a chance i was gonna fuck it up there but
05:30:18 i didn't fuck it up it's okay um it is a shit show um um you know i've been i've been having this
05:30:29 idea i've been i keep coming back to this to this run a fucking d&d game as a podcast idea in fact

05:36:02 more carefully if you had just sort of you know mulled over your options a little bit more if it
05:36:10 was more of a perfect run you could say yeah then i think everything could have worked out
05:36:16 out pretty well in the end but i think you might have just rushed it out and uh instead of
05:36:24 getting out a good run to the people you've just shit out a bad one over and over and over again
