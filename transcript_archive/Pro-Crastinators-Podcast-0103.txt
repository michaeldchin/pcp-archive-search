00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I am the best
00:00:11 guy ever and let's see who else is here. We got Ben Saint. Minimum wage. Illegal band.
00:00:21 We've got Tom Oliver. I was really upset at the death of Steve Jobs. It ruined Apple
00:00:26 and it's cost him thousands of dollars in revenue from me personally because I will
00:00:30 not buy their products anymore because they're so fucking bad. Well, how unfortunate. We've
00:00:37 got Munchy. Hi guys, it's me, Prisoner308. Welcome back to day 238 of my let's play of
00:00:46 Breaking Out of Jail. The Warner hasn't found me yet but he just might. Stay tuned. I really
00:00:51 wish you'd said Prisoner358 because that's Casey Neistat's new company 358 and you would
00:00:56 have been the one political prisoner of Casey Neistat. But anyway, the one political prisoner.
00:01:00 Have you fucking seen that guy? Maybe I'm just the first prisoner. Okay, fair enough.
00:01:05 And welcome to Thew. Hey buddy. In the land of Ooze, there was a man whose name was Job.
00:01:11 This man was blameless and upright. He feared God and shunned evil. Nice. Thew, I just need
00:01:18 to let it sink in. How many, like, fangirls just squeed and glomped themselves because
00:01:25 Thew is on this episode. It needs to sink in for you. I'm very happy. I'm very happy
00:01:30 to have the legendary cryptid Thew break weir's head once more. Let's just know cousin of
00:01:36 Slimmer Man, Thew underscore thes here for another round of the Procrastiners podcast.
00:01:41 Yeah. Welcome. Welcome. Nate, you're the person. You're the guy who started it. What are we
00:01:47 doing? What are we doing? Why are we here? Listen up, everybody. Here's what we're doing.
00:01:52 We're talking about jobs. We're talking about jobs. What is a job? Where is a job? Please
00:01:58 give me a job. I deserve a job for free. I don't have to work. I deserve a job. Just
00:02:03 give it to me. Let's get into it. All right. So here we go, everybody. A definition of
00:02:07 a job according to Urban Dictionary. Here's what we got. Job means by which at least 30%
00:02:13 of your life is stolen from you. Here we go. To enrich the owners of a company making useless
00:02:21 shit that some other poor idiot in a job will buy. Wow. Are we going to have to fight Nate?
00:02:34 Tom over here. That sounds right. I'm with Tom. We need to seize the means of production,
00:02:39 you motherfuckers. I think I wrote that definition myself. Edited by Ben St. It says. There you
00:02:45 go. Ben has had an allergy to jobs. Why would you edit my perfect entry, Ben? God damn it.
00:02:50 Now that we're past the re-perselection podcast, let me just lay down the law here and say
00:02:57 that I am post-job. I am post-job. My generation is post-job. We do not need jobs anymore. We
00:03:06 are past the point of jobs and now we can just do things on the internet and that can be where we
00:03:12 make money. Well, I mean, yeah, we're in the crowdsourcing crowdfunding era. At least we're
00:03:18 starting out. We can't all do that. And I'm saying my generation is post-job. Well, okay. The reality
00:03:24 of the situation is most people get jobs. What? In America, at least. In America. What are you
00:03:30 saying? I am one of them. I have a job. I have a job that subsidizes, at the moment,
00:03:37 like my internet activities because I, you know, work at it and devote my time to it and stuff.
00:03:42 But listen to the second definition of job, by the way, because this is also incredible,
00:03:46 just in a different way. Job, something that's impossible to find because everyone only wants
00:03:51 to hire experienced people even though you can't get experience if no one will hire you and they're
00:03:56 too damn lazy, you're too damn selfish to train you. And then there's a quote,
00:04:02 finding a job is such a pain. I'm imagining like a guy, I'm imagining a guy in like a
00:04:10 rumpled up, you know, business shirt and like his tie is all pulled loose and stuff and he's like
00:04:14 hungover. He's all scruffy and five o'clock shadow and he's just been out pounding the pavement.
00:04:20 He's been out pounding the pavement trying to, you know, trying to work to get his life on.
00:04:25 Yeah, it's not at all that this person was actually sitting at their computer refreshing
00:04:29 Craigslist for one hour a day and deciding that was enough work. Thank you very much.
00:04:34 And then going back to play Hexbox, damn that Hexbox for the rest of the day.
00:04:38 There are definitely people like that, but the job market is pretty retarded, especially in
00:04:42 Craigslist. Well, don't get me wrong, it took me like three years to find a job that I now have
00:04:47 and it's a great job. It's a very good job. Well, it's funny, you said that and I was immediately
00:04:51 reminded of a tweet I saw on like the, you know, how like Twitter has like recommended things.
00:04:55 They had like the UX Twitter for some reason, it like knows that I went to school for design
00:04:59 and like always recommends me all these things. And one of them was a terrifying a job posting
00:05:03 for a programmer and it's like required 10 years of experience in Swift, which is like
00:05:08 Apple's programming language. And I just like posted a screenshot of that. And he's just like,
00:05:13 Swift has only been around for three years. Oh my God. It's just like LeMau. Oh no. So yeah,
00:05:20 it's pretty dumb. It's pretty stupid. Well, there's a lot to say about jobs. I mean, these are
00:05:25 actually really good jumping off points, these two definitions, because they're really, they really
00:05:28 showcase what the current generation thinks of jobs. And you know what? Well, wait, the last
00:05:34 generation, we are in the Gen X is represented right here. The last generation, we are not going to be,
00:05:39 you know, degraded with your disgusting millennial tendencies. We are, we are post job. We are,
00:05:45 I don't have a bite in this. Millennials, millennials failed to get jobs. And then Gen X is post
00:05:51 jobs. They get off scot free. They win. They want to take credit for, but really they had no choice
00:05:56 because jobs just don't exist anymore. Clearly. Yeah. That's, that's, they're for baby boomers only.
00:06:01 Hate the tale. The game has changed in a lot of ways. It really has. Because like in the old days,
00:06:06 you know, everybody says it, but like in the fifties, you know, you'd go to fucking elementary
00:06:10 school, you go to middle school, you'd maybe finish high school, and then you could get a job at a
00:06:14 factory like one guy and provide for you, your wife and your nine hot children. You could do that
00:06:20 back in those days. You could pay, you could pay your way through college where flipping burgers
00:06:26 over the summer. It's true. That's true. That is generally true. I do think that what has happened
00:06:31 is it's, it's fucking machine learning. Basically, as long as there's anyone who knows how to do
00:06:36 something, it'll only take some developer about a couple of months to create a program that can do
00:06:42 it as well. We're seeing this happen with like analysis videos on YouTube. I'm pretty sure over
00:06:48 the summer, someone's going to make an algorithm that can produce a nerd writer video. There's
00:06:52 already top 10s, dude. Nerd writer's not that far above a top 10. The last thing you want to see
00:06:57 is someone standing in your lettuce at Burger King. This person posted themselves on Burger King
00:07:03 standing on lettuce and posted it on 4jack. Yeah, so like this thing is basically the only way to be
00:07:10 a... There's so many cryptids. The only fucking way... Why did we do cryptids for the topics?
00:07:14 Next time, next episode. Sorry, dude. Sorry. No, no. The only way to fucking make money and have a job
00:07:19 is to outthink all humans and all robots in the world, right? And that's what basically all of us
00:07:26 do. We all talk about things, but it's certain things. I mean, that's created with the people that
00:07:30 had to figure it out slightly. The scale floor is so high for this game. Yeah. No, it's the only
00:07:34 fucking way. It's the only fucking way. The only thing you can do is to be ahead of trends,
00:07:39 and that's the only way to make money now. I mean, just the way that it is, like, and this is the way
00:07:44 that's technically always been. It's just that technology is advancing so fast now. Like the
00:07:47 only thing that anyone will pay someone to do is that they can't do on their own, or they can't,
00:07:54 like, hire a machine to do at a much lower cost than it would take to hire a human. So, for example,
00:07:59 you got, like, a janitor. Like, yes, you could get a robot to be a janitor in theory, but that would
00:08:04 probably be really expensive, so it's cheaper to just, like, hire a guy to push a group around.
00:08:07 The fact that we have every job listing for entry-level jobs requires 25,000 years of experience,
00:08:13 I think it's probably because of, you know, the legal system and employee protection system is
00:08:19 kind of being outdated at this point. Like, we don't have the frameworks, both legal and colloquial,
00:08:25 or unofficial, that we have as expectations for what an employee-employer relationship should be
00:08:30 is kind of dated at this point. At this point, having a job is just sort of filling in the
00:08:35 cracks that robots can't quite fulfill yet, you know what I mean? Like, and yeah, like, all the
00:08:41 friends I know who have, like, regular-ass jobs at, like, stores, they're always worked part-time,
00:08:47 but given as many hours as you can possibly make someone do without it being full-time.
00:08:53 Yeah. Right?
00:08:54 That's like 39 hours a week or whatever.
00:08:55 The worst.
00:08:57 Should be illegal.
00:08:58 It's like...
00:08:59 Yeah, I mean, it's just in the nature that, like, as long as it's not technically illegal,
00:09:03 these giant organizations are gonna do whatever they can to maximize profit and minimize expense.
00:09:08 So, you know?
00:09:09 But yeah, employee protection, like, I'm not trying to sound all fucking randy in here,
00:09:13 but it does make humans more expensive to take care of because robots, you can kick them around,
00:09:18 and abuse them all day long, and be a cheese gate with them, and I think that that is part of why,
00:09:23 uh, yeah, entry-level jobs require five years of experience now.
00:09:27 You know what? Guys, the PCP podcast is probably repetitive enough to us to get
00:09:34 AI versions of ourselves, and the people won't know the difference,
00:09:38 so we can just rake in the cash by putting our AIs up to battle week after week.
00:09:43 I have no doubt. There is a formula. There's an algorithm we could assemble.
00:09:46 You know, you start off the podcast, you got, like, uh, you know,
00:09:49 like, you get a percentage chance of, like, 90% I do an intro,
00:09:53 then there's, like, a 10% chance it's one of the other random people who'll do it.
00:09:56 Then after that, you've got, like, Urban Dictionary.
00:09:58 Like, literally just have a bot read the definition from UrbanDictionary.com,
00:10:02 and then you just move on, you just, you go to Wikipedia, you look up the entries there,
00:10:07 and you just make a random, you select random words from that page,
00:10:10 and you insert them into a thing. You have it cut from person to person every,
00:10:13 like, 20 seconds or something, maybe less than that.
00:10:15 And then at one point, you have a giant section of weird utilitarianism just stuck in there.
00:10:19 You just insert that awkwardly and arbitrarily, and then you just go to the questions.
00:10:23 Uh, it's, it's, it's baby shit.
00:10:26 We gotta get, we gotta get people on this. We, we gotta, we gotta calm up.
00:10:29 We gotta calm up. We need, we, this needs to be real.
00:10:32 Bonus episode, the, come on with the next bonus episode, the PCPAI episode.
00:10:36 Oh, that'd be a great idea. The next bonus is the bot episode.
00:10:40 Okay, we gotta get working on that.
00:10:41 Yeah.
00:10:41 Yeah, PBSA News channel made an algorithm up to themselves.
00:10:42 Please email me Steve Jobs.
00:10:44 Uh,
00:10:46 Nate, it seems like you're pretty, you're coming down hard on the jobs are good,
00:10:50 and everyone, and if you don't have a job, well, then my, like, time to perish.
00:10:55 Well, okay, listen, I, I'm just very hard on the personal responsibility front, you know?
00:11:00 And like, if you don't have a job, like, I, I get it.
00:11:03 There are all these challenges that you face in our, you know,
00:11:06 like my generation is at all these issues.
00:11:08 I was pretty lucky because right from the start, I was interested in technology
00:11:12 and like computer science stuff.
00:11:14 And now I'm a programmer, professional programmer now.
00:11:16 And like, it's, it's a great place to be.
00:11:18 That is, it's pretty much one of the best places to be to get a job.
00:11:22 And I'm really, really sorry to everybody out there who has an intrinsic interest
00:11:27 in to use the old cliche lesbian dance theory or like just what it doesn't matter,
00:11:31 you know, art history, whatever it is.
00:11:33 I'm really sorry that no one wants to fucking hire your ass once you get a degree in that shit.
00:11:38 But it, it like, it's your life.
00:11:41 It's your life to run.
00:11:42 And the world doesn't give a shit if you get a job or not.
00:11:46 Only you can carve out your place in the world.
00:11:49 So it's your responsibility.
00:11:50 Once you're fucking 18, 17, 20, whatever it is, figure your shit out.
00:11:54 Don't get into massive debt.
00:11:55 Don't be stupid.
00:11:57 Find a place where you can get a job or, I mean, or be an entrepreneur, you know,
00:12:00 go outside the system that's easier than ever now.
00:12:02 It's just, I, I don't, whenever I hear people complain about the job market, I think like,
00:12:07 I, what I hear is, it sure is unfair that people will not give me shit.
00:12:14 That's really upsetting to me.
00:12:15 That's really upsetting to me.
00:12:17 And I, again, I acknowledge all the challenges involved in this,
00:12:20 but no one owes you anything and normal that attitude help you to get the things you want.
00:12:25 I'm interested in helping people get what they want in life and be better people.
00:12:29 And that means, you know, not just sitting around and wishing you had a job, but like
00:12:33 literally going out and like, if you go to school for five years and you get your art degree or
00:12:37 whatever, and then you find yourself flipping burgers and like, because that's the only job
00:12:41 that's around, I get it.
00:12:42 That's going to kill you.
00:12:43 It's going to be crippling.
00:12:44 But here's what you do.
00:12:45 You don't cry about it on your fucking blog.
00:12:48 You go and you assess your situation and you determine a path to get what you do want in life.
00:12:54 You know, a better job, you know, whatever it is you want, you make a fucking strategy
00:13:00 and it's just completely useless to sit around and complain about it.
00:13:04 If you're like interested in politics, you could perhaps address what you consider to be
00:13:08 like issues.
00:13:09 Like I'm not a hundred percent on either side of like the minimum wage debate,
00:13:12 but there is real stuff there.
00:13:14 So I could understand someone like committing themselves to fighting on some side of that argument.
00:13:20 But again, don't let politics distract you from the shit you should be doing to run
00:13:24 your life better.
00:13:25 That's the most important thing.
00:13:27 We are all responsible for our own shit.
00:13:29 So when it comes to jobs, you know, like my mentality is projected onto like,
00:13:33 you know, if someone else has a job they could or could not offer you,
00:13:36 you have to make them want to give it to you by providing value.
00:13:41 That's, you know, that's the long term of it.
00:13:42 I gotta tell you, this is one of the only weird totalitarian rants that I would a hundred
00:13:47 percent agree with and I don't have any problem with.
00:13:48 Well, there you go.
00:13:49 Fantastic.
00:13:50 I think we might be venturing into the realm of non weird utilitarian.
00:13:53 I think this might be the realm of normal, normal discussion.
00:13:58 Yeah, that seems like a pretty normal to me.
00:14:01 Well, okay, wait, my, my, my, my mother obviously would like me to go to college
00:14:08 and she is always like, you know, you're such a good artist.
00:14:13 You're drawn the computer and I can't even believe it to me.
00:14:16 I don't even get it.
00:14:18 How can you do that?
00:14:19 You should go to art college.
00:14:21 But I, this kid, this kid's able to go to yahoo.com.
00:14:24 I know an email account.
00:14:26 He's got computer skills.
00:14:27 How does he do it?
00:14:28 I just can't never know.
00:14:30 I can't even turn my computer on.
00:14:32 I don't know what the fuck's going on.
00:14:36 But, but if I, if I were to go to college,
00:14:39 I would go like hard in to like, like, like a STEM field, like like engineering,
00:14:45 like my go to is engineering and my mom's always like, well, well, why do you,
00:14:50 like you don't have an interest in engineering.
00:14:52 You don't like engineering.
00:14:54 Why, why wouldn't you go to something that you like?
00:14:56 Because what I'm not fucking stupid is why because I'm not,
00:14:59 I don't want to get a degree that won't help me get a job.
00:15:03 If I'm going to invest in going to college,
00:15:06 then my investment should be returned as fast and as quickly as possible.
00:15:09 You know, I know we've said this a million times,
00:15:11 but like what is the point of college?
00:15:13 What is the point of college?
00:15:15 It is to eventually prepare you for a job.
00:15:17 It is not adult baby camp, you know, where you can just go around and fuck around.
00:15:22 It is that, but that's not, that's not ideal.
00:15:25 It's not, it's not helpful that it is that we should strive against that.
00:15:28 Yeah.
00:15:29 I recently found out, like I didn't realize that this was a thing about, about courses like,
00:15:36 like that are just like, you can just like buy a college course.
00:15:41 Buy a college course that like just is a course for like a semester.
00:15:47 Like you can just do that.
00:15:49 You can just buy an art like, like course.
00:15:52 If you're like, oh, you know, I really want to be taught anatomy by like a teacher.
00:15:56 So like, you can just buy a course for anatomy at an art school.
00:16:00 Oh, well, dude, you know, I'm sure that's true.
00:16:02 And I'm sure like some, some schools do this differently than I was.
00:16:05 I've literally, I've literally seen that I'm going to do that.
00:16:08 So I mean, that's cool and all.
00:16:10 And like, if you think it's worth your money and like it's something that you're really interested in,
00:16:13 then great, you know, it's just, it's just, you know, you shouldn't expect.
00:16:17 Like there's no reason you can't like go to like engineering school, make that sweet dash
00:16:23 and then just put in the fucking work when you're doing your sick ass engineering job
00:16:28 and also do art.
00:16:29 That's not, you are not prohibited from that.
00:16:31 You don't have an excuse.
00:16:32 If you come home from work every day fucking tiring, you're like,
00:16:35 you know what, I have this passion for doing, I really want to draw or do whatever,
00:16:40 then you should try, then you should do or whatever.
00:16:46 If you don't like, if you don't do the thing that you want to do,
00:16:50 then you got to wonder like how much, how much you care.
00:16:53 I don't, I don't want to suck my own dick too hard here.
00:16:56 But like that's exactly what I did.
00:16:57 You're the best about this.
00:16:59 Yeah.
00:16:59 I mean, that this is what I did.
00:17:01 I, you know, I took the long, you know, I didn't do a digit and I respect digit for what he did,
00:17:04 but I took a much safer route with my career path where I slowly but surely kept working on my college,
00:17:10 kept doing myself, worked my shitty part time jobs, but the entire time I would do exactly that.
00:17:15 Come home exhausted from like building furniture at peer one or, you know,
00:17:19 stand on my feet doing just a bunch of stupid bullshit that everybody does.
00:17:21 It was like a shitty job.
00:17:23 And then come home and it's like, okay, time to work for like five hours making a video now.
00:17:26 I'm going to do that now because that's what I want to do.
00:17:27 And like, if you don't do that, I question how committed you really are to this thing.
00:17:32 Yeah.
00:17:33 I, what I love about you, Nate, this is going to turn into Circle of the Jerk episode two.
00:17:37 Yes, go.
00:17:39 It is, is, is that you like, like, like your base stats are like fine, but your true talent,
00:17:46 your, your talent is that you just will go forever and never stop.
00:17:51 You just like, you will just never cease your, your, your tiring advance.
00:17:56 No matter how like, like it hurts your body or soul, you will just never give up.
00:18:01 That, that's your one, that's your one true, like, like special unique ability.
00:18:06 And you know, again, I don't want to suck my dick either here,
00:18:08 but it's really nice that like other people have started to kind of emulate that with that,
00:18:11 like a bunch of people have done like their own we Aguiz now, or not we Aguiz, but, but
00:18:15 their own me a math of us.
00:18:16 Like, like I just copied guys like Digi and other people who have done like a month of solid content,
00:18:21 but it's the branding man.
00:18:23 It's that Huey's law that makes people see like, wow, this guy really sells me on how cool it is
00:18:28 to work hard on stuff.
00:18:29 And then other people do it.
00:18:30 And it's like, and then every, everyone is glad they did it.
00:18:33 They feel better.
00:18:34 They feel like heroes.
00:18:35 Ask them all, ask, ask math whiz, ask man mode.
00:18:38 Ask any of those other fucking guys who did it.
00:18:40 Uh, you will be a better person if you just tie yourself to a standard into the legendary
00:18:46 munchy W tiny hats vlog, watery advice.
00:18:51 This was vlogger accord at rad con three, where I took a shower after like 20 minutes
00:18:56 of debating if I want to take a shower.
00:18:57 Because you know, like, oh, you know, I, I, I want to just go downstairs and just hang out.
00:19:01 You know, I don't know if I really want to put in the effort to take a shower.
00:19:04 It's too much.
00:19:05 But then I fucking did it.
00:19:06 I forced myself to, and it was great.
00:19:08 Immediately the water hits me and I feel like a new fucking man.
00:19:12 And I, and this is the same thing that goes as I say in the video for like working out
00:19:17 or, you know, like, like, like exercising anyway, taking a shower, doing the normal people stuff.
00:19:22 You might not want to put in the effort into doing work.
00:19:25 But once you do, it'll feel so good.
00:19:28 It's just like, it's just, it's always like that.
00:19:32 It's always like that in every way.
00:19:34 And every way.
00:19:35 It'll feel good.
00:19:37 It'll be good when you do it.
00:19:38 And you'll get the experience, obviously, of doing it.
00:19:42 And if you don't, you will feel bad.
00:19:43 You didn't do the thing you know you need to do.
00:19:45 So you're even preventing yourself from feeling bad.
00:19:47 And that all becomes a good thing that you feel about yourself.
00:19:49 That's how like I feel when I work out and when I come out and do work or any of that shit.
00:19:52 Ben, this is what you're saying.
00:19:54 Oh, I was, I was going to say, yeah, you've got to, you've got to step outside yourself
00:19:58 and be like, I am, you know, I feel averse to doing this thing that is good for me.
00:20:03 But, you know, I know that even though it doesn't feel like it now, objectively,
00:20:07 I know that I will feel good once I do it.
00:20:09 And you have to like, you have to like kind of go on faith.
00:20:12 You have to kind of operate on faith that that is what will happen,
00:20:15 that you will be glad you did it.
00:20:17 Well, you know, the thing is, the problem is that everyone is like,
00:20:24 Oh, what's the point of life to be happy?
00:20:26 And that's not the truth.
00:20:27 That's wrong.
00:20:28 That's false.
00:20:29 The real meaning of life is to find something that gives you meaning.
00:20:33 You have to do something that makes you feel fulfilled.
00:20:35 And fulfillment is totally different than happiness.
00:20:38 Happiness is eating an entire pizza.
00:20:40 Fulfillment is like doing something that like 10 years from now,
00:20:43 you'll look back and think that was fucking amazing.
00:20:45 So I agree.
00:20:47 I think most people delaying gratification.
00:20:49 Delaying gratification is the most important skill anyone can have.
00:20:54 Look, it's called life edging.
00:20:55 All right, get into it.
00:20:57 That's it, man.
00:20:58 That's exactly it.
00:20:59 Like, I don't know.
00:21:01 Like I remember so well that full year,
00:21:04 it took me one year to make both of my Gurren login videos.
00:21:08 And I remember coming home after my fucking shitty job building furniture,
00:21:12 and I would grab my fucking laptop, get in my car, drive to that.
00:21:17 My parents had like loaned me.
00:21:18 It wasn't actually my car and that a drive to the fucking library.
00:21:21 So I'd have privacy and be able to focus and sit there on my terrible
00:21:24 fucking laptop that couldn't even play a preview image.
00:21:28 So I had to render out footage and then play it back.
00:21:30 If I want to see if the edit had worked properly and just do that.
00:21:34 And again, you know, six months, just like month after month after month,
00:21:37 working on the shit, coming home, recording, whatever I need to do.
00:21:41 I'm not interested in like making myself sound cool.
00:21:44 When I'm interested in having people understand why this is important
00:21:47 and why it matters that this is how you orient your life,
00:21:50 you got to know that the best things in life take work
00:21:53 and you should not sit around and be like, why are people giving me shit?
00:21:57 I care about you, everybody listening to this.
00:21:59 I want you to have the best life possible.
00:22:01 And the way you can do that is by empowering yourself
00:22:05 and take responsibility for your life.
00:22:07 I just want everyone to be happy.
00:22:09 God damn it.
00:22:09 And this is how you do it.
00:22:10 Nate, you're literally Caliburn.
00:22:12 You literally are Caliburn in every way, in every way.
00:22:17 Yeah, you're playing a game that's supposed to be unwinnable to play.
00:22:23 And you're just fucking cranking shit out
00:22:25 and you're abusing women every step of the way
00:22:28 and getting your shit done to its fullest extent.
00:22:34 And you'll know the taste of my lash.
00:22:36 The PCP is just the felt that Nate has amassed
00:22:40 over his years grinding out this fucking shit.
00:22:44 As I conquer planet to planet,
00:22:46 I'm like, dissented to that black hole in the sky.
00:22:48 Yeah, sick.
00:22:50 God, X6 was so good.
00:22:51 Remember that part?
00:22:52 Oh, it was really good.
00:22:53 Hey, this is all cool and all.
00:22:58 I feel like we've gone through a little bit of the philosophy.
00:22:59 Believe it or not, whenever we talk too much about how cool I am,
00:23:03 I don't want to do it for that long.
00:23:04 I would rather hear about some specific stories of jobs
00:23:07 that we've each had that are there that I've had a blot in my life.
00:23:12 This is the Nate redemption episode,
00:23:14 where I take back everything that I felt for the past three years.
00:23:18 And Nate comes around to be normal.
00:23:20 He'd be like, you know, guys, let's not get too into the philosophy.
00:23:23 Let's try and transfer into some standard stories here
00:23:26 and get back to the roots here.
00:23:28 Ever since Radcon, I've just had two phrases
00:23:31 ringing in my mind the whole time.
00:23:32 It's, where are the memes?
00:23:34 And give me the memes.
00:23:35 And by Christ, I know that's what the people crave.
00:23:38 So that's what we got to do.
00:23:41 All right, you were talking.
00:23:42 So you're barred from entry to talk about stories now.
00:23:46 Tom, you haven't said anything, basically this entire podcast.
00:23:49 You're basically not worthy of existence.
00:23:51 What else is new?
00:23:53 No, fuck.
00:23:55 I mean, I agree with everything that's been said so far.
00:23:57 Is that like, yeah, you got to like fucking make your shit happen.
00:24:00 And that's just the, you got to grind if you want to.
00:24:03 Where are the memes?
00:24:04 Give me the stories.
00:24:06 That's the memes.
00:24:07 Well, Munchy, you were horrified at my story.
00:24:09 I told you about how my job got fucked over out of college.
00:24:13 Oh, yeah.
00:24:13 Oh, yeah.
00:24:15 Yeah.
00:24:16 So I, the reason like my whole life went to shit
00:24:21 is because I had, I had everything set up and lined up after school
00:24:25 and then it all was cruelly robbed from me at the last second
00:24:28 for no fault of my own.
00:24:31 So when I,
00:24:31 That's what they all say.
00:24:33 What?
00:24:33 Yeah.
00:24:34 Yeah.
00:24:34 I mean, I'm just going to like turn this all around
00:24:36 and take all responsibility off of my clothes.
00:24:40 Well.
00:24:41 But no, so when I was going to school, like during the summer
00:24:45 and the winter, I would work doing like, I sort of an internship.
00:24:49 It was like a college program at where my dad works.
00:24:52 He works as a contractor at Hanscom Air Force Base.
00:24:55 So he's like, he does like businessy sort of things.
00:24:59 He balances like a billion dollar budget and stuff.
00:25:01 He's a smart guy.
00:25:03 Cool.
00:25:03 And so he's like, hey, you're poor as fuck.
00:25:07 Come work here at this program thing.
00:25:08 If they accept you, you can go do that.
00:25:10 I'm like, okay.
00:25:11 So I just started going there, just like doing a like paperwork
00:25:15 and filing things away.
00:25:16 And then I got an email and they were like, hey,
00:25:20 we need this thing designed.
00:25:21 Does anybody know how to do art things?
00:25:23 And I'm just like, hey, this is what I've been waiting for.
00:25:26 So I designed them this whole like thing just in my spare time.
00:25:29 And like it wasn't open for like people in my position,
00:25:32 but I'm just like, I'll just do it anyway.
00:25:33 Because I have a bunch of downtime in the middle of like the things
00:25:36 they're giving me to do.
00:25:37 So I did it.
00:25:37 And they're like, whoa, this is fucking great.
00:25:38 We're going to use it.
00:25:39 So like it's all over the place at the base now and stuff, I guess.
00:25:42 And they still use it.
00:25:43 And I was like, oh, that's sick.
00:25:44 And they're like, you need to come back again
00:25:46 and do like design work for us this time.
00:25:48 Like, all right, sick.
00:25:50 And then I started doing that.
00:25:51 And then they were like, yeah, you're great.
00:25:54 We like you a lot.
00:25:55 We're going to hire you doing design here at the design team
00:25:58 once you're done with school.
00:25:59 And like six months at this point, I'm like, yes, I'm fucking sick.
00:26:02 This is great.
00:26:03 I'm going to get like a big cushy paid job right out of the gate.
00:26:05 It's going to be great.
00:26:07 And then fucking Obama cut the funds.
00:26:10 And they killed my fucking position literally two weeks
00:26:14 before I was set to graduate.
00:26:15 So when I graduated, I'm like, well, I have no backup plan.
00:26:17 Because I literally have been working where I was supposed
00:26:19 to get hired in two weeks.
00:26:20 And they fucked me.
00:26:23 And then I was a sad boy.
00:26:25 Winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, Barack Hussein Obama.
00:26:29 Where's Tom's piece, Obama?
00:26:31 Where is it?
00:26:32 I put in the hours.
00:26:33 I put in the effort.
00:26:35 What?
00:26:35 What was the thing you worked for?
00:26:37 I just worked for it.
00:26:39 It's a hands come air force base.
00:26:40 It's an acquisition base.
00:26:43 Yeah.
00:26:45 Any, are you commenting there to do anything to say
00:26:47 on the matter?
00:26:48 Well, military spending still increased every year.
00:26:51 Yeah.
00:26:52 Well, not for me.
00:26:53 I know, right?
00:26:54 Yeah, I guess it was bullshit.
00:26:56 They can spend a trillion dollars on like the F-35,
00:26:59 but they can't throw me like 30 grand a year, those fucks.
00:27:04 Now I understand why Tom's a communist.
00:27:07 It's not to rebel against the citizen himself.
00:27:11 It's to spite Obama himself.
00:27:13 It's to get back at the man.
00:27:15 The ultimate cracker of capitalists.
00:27:17 Yeah, yeah.
00:27:18 Tom is looking at Obama up on Capitol Hill
00:27:21 with his fucking fist clutch.
00:27:23 I was ready to make the man rock over there.
00:27:26 I was ready and bushy-tailed.
00:27:27 I remember going into college and I was like,
00:27:29 Dad, I know this is expensive, right?
00:27:32 How much is it going to cost me per month when I graduate?
00:27:35 And straight up, everybody has debt.
00:27:38 Don't worry about it.
00:27:39 And I was like, okay, Dad, I'll believe you.
00:27:42 I don't mean this to be mean or anything,
00:27:44 but your father failed you in this one small thing.
00:27:47 Small, small thing.
00:27:50 Well, okay, that's true.
00:27:52 I'm not trying to say the guy's evil or anything,
00:27:54 but so much of the generation above us has underestimated
00:27:58 and wasn't fully abreast of the situation
00:28:01 that we found ourselves in.
00:28:02 And it is fair to criticize.
00:28:04 It's fair to criticize for that.
00:28:05 Because out of school.
00:28:07 It was a different system when they grew up.
00:28:08 Out of school.
00:28:08 It was a system when they did this.
00:28:10 I really struggle.
00:28:11 My spills were $500 a month in student loans.
00:28:15 If he had said son,
00:28:16 you're going to have to pay $500 a month,
00:28:18 I'd have been like, well, I'm not going to school.
00:28:20 He probably didn't actually know,
00:28:22 because none of our parents grew up
00:28:23 in the same economy that we're in right now.
00:28:27 If you look at the charts about how, I'm sure you have,
00:28:30 but the charts of the increases in enrollment costs
00:28:33 of colleges and housing and boarding
00:28:35 and all the stuff that people used to do themselves.
00:28:37 But now, because it's all rolled into that,
00:28:38 you can just fucking take a big out federal loan
00:28:40 and just push all, delay the fucking, delay the pain.
00:28:44 As opposed to the growth which causes the cost
00:28:47 to constantly increase for future generations.
00:28:51 And I'll tell you, I'll tell you why.
00:28:53 This isn't really a conspiracy, because this is just true.
00:28:55 But it's the fact that we do this.
00:28:58 It's the fact that we just have this magic wand
00:29:00 we can wave and say, I get into college now.
00:29:03 All my problems get delayed for four or eight years.
00:29:06 The fact that that exists is why it's so easy for the colleges
00:29:11 to just keep blowing up their fucking prices
00:29:13 that they charge for enrollment and shit.
00:29:15 And the government just like magically creates more money.
00:29:17 Like, okay, sure, we'll just give you our money.
00:29:19 It's a huge fucking evil cycle,
00:29:21 and we all get ground up in it.
00:29:22 It's more or less the same thing
00:29:23 as what happens to healthcare prices and housing prices.
00:29:27 Sounds right to me.
00:29:28 I don't trust big corporations on any of this shit.
00:29:30 I trust big corporations to make my shoes
00:29:32 and make my iPhones and stuff.
00:29:33 I don't protect them to protect my fucking data or anything.
00:29:36 But that's why I would much rather any fucking time,
00:29:39 like just like deal with individual people
00:29:42 and have like a small little business that I run one-on-one,
00:29:45 as opposed to these giant corporations
00:29:47 that literally are more powerful than the governments
00:29:49 that theoretically control them.
00:29:51 But actually, they have massive sway over
00:29:53 through fucking funding them politically
00:29:55 through super PACs and all this bullshit.
00:29:58 Oh, it's a mad world.
00:29:59 What are we to do?
00:29:59 What are we to do?
00:30:00 Is there anything that we could do about the system?
00:30:04 How can we change the system?
00:30:05 Is there any way to do that?
00:30:06 Or is it so off the rails now
00:30:08 that there's no point in even acknowledging
00:30:10 that there's a problem?
00:30:11 I really think the only thing to do
00:30:13 is stop relying on the government.
00:30:14 The solution is clearly to seize the means of production.
00:30:17 Yeah!
00:30:20 Well, it sort of is only in the sense of by seizing it,
00:30:23 we stop relying on the government to do shit for us
00:30:26 because it allows them to do this stuff.
00:30:27 Listen, guys, I'm not,
00:30:29 I'm no fucking hardcore,
00:30:30 like all government is inherently bad or any of that shit.
00:30:33 But I'm telling you right now,
00:30:34 like who the fuck wants your government
00:30:36 to control like every aspect of your life?
00:30:38 Do you trust these fucking bureaucrats
00:30:39 to control every minute detail?
00:30:42 They've got 300 million people to control it.
00:30:44 Don't be a didgy bro and let the civil system come to pass.
00:30:47 You gotta be more woke than that.
00:30:49 I'm with you and I am on your side,
00:30:52 but I want to be Del's advocate
00:30:53 because there are people who are a dirt pour
00:30:56 like white trash like trailer parks
00:30:58 and they are just in the cycle
00:31:01 where everyone around them.
00:31:02 How dare you talk about talking like that?
00:31:07 They're in the cycle where like
00:31:09 their dad relied on the government
00:31:10 and his dad relied on the government
00:31:12 and now like they are just so entrenched in that culture.
00:31:16 Like what can they do to break through?
00:31:18 Because it's not like they have any money to begin with.
00:31:20 It's totally, that's a totally fair point,
00:31:23 but here's the real deal.
00:31:25 Fuck them.
00:31:26 Fuck them.
00:31:27 That's my answer to this question.
00:31:29 At some point, someone's gotta pay
00:31:31 and it's gonna be these people.
00:31:32 I'm really sorry.
00:31:33 I'm really sorry.
00:31:34 I wish it wouldn't happen.
00:31:36 Wait, wait, they have to pay for what?
00:31:38 Well, they went when we, like just for example,
00:31:41 they were one crazy example.
00:31:42 If we just, for example, cut welfare 100%,
00:31:46 just say it was gone,
00:31:47 because let's just say America had a revolution
00:31:49 where everyone realized that like taxation is theft
00:31:51 just crossed the board.
00:31:52 Let's just say that happened.
00:31:53 Then like, then man,
00:31:55 that sucks for all the people
00:31:56 who really relied on welfare to live and shit.
00:31:58 That's like, and that's gonna cause huge problems.
00:32:00 Like all those people will probably
00:32:01 not be able to pay their fucking rent,
00:32:03 get kicked out with a massive homeless population.
00:32:04 You know, the housing market will crash
00:32:06 because people can't afford the things
00:32:08 that were being subsidized by the government.
00:32:09 Don't get me wrong.
00:32:10 There's gonna be huge problems.
00:32:11 But long term, long term,
00:32:14 I like to think things would go better.
00:32:16 You know, if there was less reliance
00:32:18 and less government control and all this shit,
00:32:20 but I'm not fucking economy.
00:32:21 The solution is something even more socialist,
00:32:27 but it's secretly better for economics, which is-
00:32:31 Bring back Obama!
00:32:34 Is he the universal guaranteed income?
00:32:36 Yeah.
00:32:37 Yeah!
00:32:38 Okay.
00:32:38 That's not a bad plan.
00:32:40 Well, yeah, because the thing is-
00:32:41 That's the opposite of what you just proposed, Nate.
00:32:43 I know, but like DeVoo said,
00:32:44 it's technically more socialist,
00:32:46 but it gets us more towards an egalitarian system.
00:32:48 Right, because it's-
00:32:49 The thing about welfare-
00:32:50 Does it, though?
00:32:50 Does it, though?
00:32:51 Well, security-
00:32:52 Well, here's my-
00:32:53 Wait, wait, wait, let DeVoo finish.
00:32:55 Okay, go.
00:32:55 The thing about all the government spending shit,
00:32:58 and let's just go on the record here.
00:33:00 The government spends way the fuck more money
00:33:02 on entitlements than it does on the military.
00:33:04 People don't-
00:33:05 Just spend more, that's true.
00:33:06 Yeah, it's true.
00:33:06 It's like significantly fucking more.
00:33:08 You could kill the entire military.
00:33:09 I thought it was something like two-
00:33:09 Two-thirds is like entitlements,
00:33:11 then one-third is the military.
00:33:11 It's like a half.
00:33:12 Like, you could actually-
00:33:13 Okay.
00:33:13 The military is like a quarter,
00:33:15 and entitlements is like half
00:33:17 of all the money the government spends.
00:33:18 And let's not-
00:33:18 Let's not be-
00:33:19 You know, like, that's a lot of money on both fronts.
00:33:21 I know, I know.
00:33:22 It's a lot of money saving both fronts.
00:33:23 It just pisses me off because people
00:33:25 always count social security, welfare,
00:33:26 blah, blah, blah, all as separate slices of the pie.
00:33:29 Right, right.
00:33:30 But they don't separate the fucking navy
00:33:32 from the fucking, you know, Air Force.
00:33:34 Anyway, irrelevant.
00:33:36 So the thing is that the government gets
00:33:38 to decide how you use your money,
00:33:40 what you can spend your money on.
00:33:42 It gives you all these rules.
00:33:43 The idea of UBI is simply that everyone,
00:33:46 everyone gets a certain amount of money,
00:33:49 the same amount of money in their bank account,
00:33:52 attach their social securities every month.
00:33:55 And that's it.
00:33:55 Doesn't matter how much or how little money you make.
00:33:57 That way you don't have to worry about losing money
00:34:00 by making more money in the form
00:34:01 of different tax brackets, for instance, right?
00:34:03 You'd make the same money every single month.
00:34:07 Well, Taboo, here is why.
00:34:08 Here is why that plan is evil,
00:34:10 and I'm coming to your house to kill you.
00:34:12 It's because that system is prejudiced
00:34:15 against the less competent.
00:34:17 That's the problem with that system.
00:34:19 And how can we discriminate against people
00:34:21 on the basis of competency?
00:34:23 How can you make that case?
00:34:24 Didn't you just make the case that we need
00:34:26 to fuck those people and let them die completely?
00:34:27 I am, I mean, I'm being...
00:34:29 He's making a joke.
00:34:30 He's trying to...
00:34:31 Where are the memes?
00:34:33 Did you like that joke?
00:34:34 Did you like that joke?
00:34:35 Yeah.
00:34:36 No, I was fucking gay.
00:34:37 There's the memes.
00:34:38 But dude, no, like, the idea of UBI
00:34:41 is that you don't have any excuses.
00:34:43 There's nothing in UBI
00:34:44 that incentivizes you to work less, you know?
00:34:47 I love it.
00:34:48 I think plenty of people know,
00:34:50 like have some Republican uncle
00:34:52 who is still on disability
00:34:53 and totally could fucking work but doesn't.
00:34:56 I have one, you know?
00:34:57 So it's just like, yeah.
00:34:59 People, you know,
00:35:01 as long as they're fair economics people,
00:35:03 they talk about how when you have the government
00:35:05 spend money on shit,
00:35:06 not only does it cost a lot of money,
00:35:08 it also results in all this fucking red tape
00:35:11 and it makes the law too complicated.
00:35:13 And I mean, complicated laws in general
00:35:16 are the secret way in which the poor get fucked over
00:35:18 because we have a lawyer society
00:35:20 where basically the better lawyers you have,
00:35:21 the more you can get away with shit and vice versa.
00:35:24 No one ever talks about that shit.
00:35:25 No one ever talks about simplifying the law.
00:35:28 That would help out a lot of people.
00:35:30 It's because who's gonna fucking report on that?
00:35:31 Fucking Rachel Maddow,
00:35:32 who's like one of the elite class, you know?
00:35:34 Right, exactly.
00:35:35 Of course not, you know?
00:35:36 So simplified law,
00:35:38 the thing is that you can't politically get away
00:35:41 with having less fucking entitlements.
00:35:44 People don't really talk about this,
00:35:45 but Republicans almost never even propose that shit.
00:35:48 It's mostly libertarian think tanks
00:35:50 talking about cutting funding for shit.
00:35:54 No one even suggests it actually.
00:35:56 No one even suggests it because it's too political.
00:35:58 I'm suggesting the right fucking now.
00:36:00 I'm doing it.
00:36:00 So my point is with UBI,
00:36:02 you sort of cheat the system
00:36:03 because everyone basically gets what they want
00:36:07 regarding helping out the poor, right?
00:36:09 But without all the red tape.
00:36:11 And I think that's probably the best compromise
00:36:12 that you can come to.
00:36:13 But even fucking the socialist paradise is like Sweden,
00:36:16 can't make that shit happen
00:36:17 because obviously the government wants all that control.
00:36:20 That's why they use the whole
00:36:24 veneer of generosity with other people's tax money
00:36:28 in order to get by with that shit.
00:36:30 But yeah, UBI, that's the closest I think we can get
00:36:33 in this generation.
00:36:35 That system is so attractive to me in many ways.
00:36:38 And everyone's gonna,
00:36:39 Tom, if you want to cut in, yeah, feel free to answer.
00:36:41 Well, I was going to say like,
00:36:42 just to play devil's advocate on it,
00:36:44 is that I think personally, I would love that.
00:36:47 I think it's a great idea.
00:36:48 My only concern with a system like that
00:36:49 is like we just talked about how like government,
00:36:53 intrusion into things like the healthcare market
00:36:55 and college drove the prices up.
00:36:58 Like wouldn't the market eventually adjust the fact
00:37:00 that, oh, everyone has X amount of money
00:37:02 so we can price everything up slowly but steadily
00:37:05 until it just doesn't matter anymore?
00:37:06 Oh, you might be right.
00:37:07 I don't actually understand economics,
00:37:09 so I don't know exactly how.
00:37:10 I got it, price controls.
00:37:11 That's always worked out.
00:37:12 Oh, I found the solution.
00:37:15 I'm gonna sound, Munchie, I do want to say something.
00:37:19 No, no, no, you go on, I'm gonna shift gears.
00:37:21 Okay, I might go on a little bit long.
00:37:23 Sure, sure, sure.
00:37:24 But it's just, so there's just a story that I want to tell
00:37:27 about me as a young man that might make people think
00:37:29 I was always evil, but here's just one.
00:37:32 If you don't need any help with that, Nate,
00:37:34 that's not a thing that we will now think.
00:37:36 Here's how you know that I'm not pretending anything
00:37:38 that I say now.
00:37:39 It's because when I was a kid,
00:37:41 I was like, you know, I was like,
00:37:43 it's because when I was a kid,
00:37:46 my mom is a special education teacher.
00:37:48 And so when I was in school, and I was doing well,
00:37:51 and I felt whatever, things were going fine.
00:37:52 I was in elementary school at this point.
00:37:54 And my mom was telling me about her day.
00:37:56 She worked with a kid one-on-one.
00:37:59 You know, she spends her days just with one kid,
00:38:02 at least with this particular job she was in
00:38:03 at the school that she worked at.
00:38:05 And I just said to my mom, okay, mom, I get it,
00:38:09 but here's my question.
00:38:10 Why are you paying so much attention to this kid
00:38:12 who will never be an amazing shining star?
00:38:17 Why not spend your time to help a kid who's really good,
00:38:20 and could be even better with one-on-one attention?
00:38:24 And she was just like, well, he doesn't need it as much.
00:38:28 I gotta help the people who are lacking
00:38:32 and need more of a boost to get up to help them.
00:38:35 And that has always confused me.
00:38:39 I've never been on board with that system.
00:38:42 Like, what is gained?
00:38:45 We feel good.
00:38:46 We feel good.
00:38:47 Yeah, like, what is gained helping someone
00:38:50 who is never gonna make significant progress?
00:38:53 Well, I guess if you wanna talk purely...
00:38:55 We feel good.
00:38:56 No, I think there's a utilitarian fact of that.
00:38:59 You know, the low achievers, they form the backbone
00:39:03 of the service industry and stuff.
00:39:06 There are people who can't really climb higher.
00:39:08 So there needs to be a minimum level of competency
00:39:11 in any sort of employed positions.
00:39:13 Yeah, you're not wrong, Tom.
00:39:16 I'm talking about people who are not even capable of speech,
00:39:19 for example, as some of these students.
00:39:22 So there's...
00:39:23 Like, we got issues.
00:39:25 I think you're severely alienating most of our audience.
00:39:30 I'm not trying to say people who are more lower functioning
00:39:33 don't deserve care or attention or appreciation.
00:39:36 It's a matter of distribution of resources
00:39:38 is what I am focusing on.
00:39:40 And I'm interested...
00:39:40 And let's be real.
00:39:42 If we invented robot butlers that could one-on-one
00:39:46 tend to all the people who needed this kind of extra care,
00:39:49 and I'll tell you right now, the way that we get there
00:39:51 is by helping people be really smart science boys
00:39:54 who are at the top level of achievement
00:39:56 so that we can invent that.
00:39:57 And right now, isn't it great that when...
00:39:59 This is just one example, but you got a girl
00:40:01 who's got some disability, she gets lost or something,
00:40:04 she pulls out what?
00:40:05 Her fucking cell phone that she couldn't have made
00:40:08 that was made by a really smart science boy
00:40:10 that science fucking developed,
00:40:11 and she calls home so someone can come pick her up
00:40:13 so she's not, you know, scared or in danger or any of that shit.
00:40:17 Like, that...
00:40:18 To me, it makes all the sense in the world
00:40:20 to focus our resources on the high achievement.
00:40:24 Oh, God.
00:40:25 On the high achievement.
00:40:26 That's what I'm saying.
00:40:27 Let it be known that I...
00:40:28 And as a baby, I detected that.
00:40:29 As a baby, I detected that shit.
00:40:31 Yeah.
00:40:31 Let it be known that I've hit the eject button
00:40:33 on this train that we've all been steaming, powering down.
00:40:36 And I am now outside.
00:40:38 I just want to gas the retarded munchie.
00:40:40 That's all I'm saying.
00:40:42 I think the reason you knew that
00:40:44 is exactly what your mom has said.
00:40:48 I don't think this is necessarily true.
00:40:51 Like, objective fact, this is what should happen.
00:40:54 Again, I'm not...
00:40:55 But the people want to...
00:40:56 The reason people want to do that
00:40:58 is because they feel like the people who are well off
00:41:01 are well off and they want to help the people who are not.
00:41:03 Whether that's morally objectionable or not,
00:41:05 I'm not here to discuss.
00:41:07 A lot of people have an instinct.
00:41:08 But people want to do it.
00:41:09 People want to help people.
00:41:10 But see, I think this is a major issue
00:41:11 of human nature itself.
00:41:13 Like, we see people who are rich
00:41:14 and I see it every fucking day.
00:41:17 I did it today.
00:41:18 Me and my girlfriend were talking about...
00:41:19 I forget who.
00:41:20 Let's just say like Nicki Minaj.
00:41:21 And it was like Nicki Minaj tweeted something
00:41:23 about being unhappy.
00:41:25 And my response was,
00:41:26 okay, but you're rich, so fuck you.
00:41:28 That's wrong.
00:41:29 That's incorrect.
00:41:31 That does not...
00:41:31 Just because someone is rich or successful
00:41:33 does not invalidate, you know, like...
00:41:36 Yeah.
00:41:36 They're part of this.
00:41:38 Well, there's a connection here.
00:41:40 There's a connection here.
00:41:40 On the rich.
00:41:42 I made the connection to those with versus those that...
00:41:45 We have such strong instincts
00:41:46 to just want to help those without.
00:41:48 And on a practical matter,
00:41:50 it is not always beneficial.
00:41:52 And this is why people love communism and socialism
00:41:54 to begin with.
00:41:55 They love the idea of just giving stuff
00:41:57 to people who are without.
00:41:58 But that might not necessarily be the best way
00:42:01 to help those people.
00:42:02 That's the point I'm trying to make here.
00:42:03 Stuff is not just something you can give.
00:42:05 When people talk about like,
00:42:06 oh, let's fucking...
00:42:08 Let's bridge that fucking wage gap
00:42:11 by giving some money over to those other people.
00:42:14 Ask yourself why the hell does handing
00:42:16 and throwing a shitload of money at Africa
00:42:18 not necessarily fix it, right?
00:42:20 There's more than just...
00:42:22 I think...
00:42:22 Okay, let me put this away.
00:42:23 When it comes to institutionalized
00:42:26 those in power versus those in not,
00:42:28 those who are not in power,
00:42:30 incomes, wealth,
00:42:32 is actually kind of a distraction.
00:42:34 It doesn't actually have all to do
00:42:36 with why certain people remain successful
00:42:38 and others don't.
00:42:39 When we just look at the wealth gap
00:42:42 or the income gap and we're like,
00:42:43 oh, if we could just fix that,
00:42:45 we fix the actual underlying reason
00:42:47 why these people are making
00:42:49 different amounts of money.
00:42:50 It doesn't make any sense.
00:42:52 Like if we make it to where it's illegal
00:42:53 to pay a CEO more than say $250,000 a year,
00:42:57 all they're gonna do
00:42:59 companies will just give CEOs
00:43:01 a shitload of free stuff to incentivize them
00:43:05 because there's a reason why CEOs get paid so much.
00:43:06 They'll work around it.
00:43:08 That actually...
00:43:09 And then we just get in the semantics game
00:43:10 of trying to criminalize each of these little things
00:43:13 and that's a huge waste of time.
00:43:14 Right.
00:43:15 Okay, I think we're conflating certain subjects
00:43:17 because I'm not talking about the rich
00:43:19 or people who just don't have the backbone
00:43:22 in order to get a job.
00:43:24 I'm talking about mentally birth defect people.
00:43:28 I'm talking about birth defect people
00:43:30 who I feel like their existence is suffering.
00:43:36 And I feel like...
00:43:37 That's not necessarily true.
00:43:38 I mean, it depends.
00:43:39 It depends on what you do in your stuff.
00:43:40 It might be content.
00:43:42 Like there's a lot of people who are retarded,
00:43:43 who are just perfectly happy,
00:43:44 it's just that they're not gonna fucking make Apple too
00:43:47 or whatever.
00:43:47 They're just...
00:43:48 I know...
00:43:50 Okay, what I'm saying is that I'm not saying
00:43:53 that we should just have all of our teachers focus
00:43:57 on the people who are just underachievers,
00:44:00 who are just able-bodied and fine
00:44:02 and can do whatever.
00:44:04 They just don't have the fortitude and willpower to do it.
00:44:08 Those people can fucking die and they don't matter.
00:44:10 At some point, somebody has to start looking out
00:44:13 for those people because if we say,
00:44:15 if we do what you say,
00:44:16 we should just focus on all of the successful people,
00:44:20 who are going far so they can create things
00:44:23 to make the robot butlers or whatever,
00:44:25 they have to care about those people
00:44:26 to want to make the robot butlers.
00:44:28 If they don't, then they'll never get made
00:44:30 and they'll just all die.
00:44:31 The way I see it, there should be a skill floor
00:44:38 that we should be trying to elevate everyone to.
00:44:40 And then once they are at that floor,
00:44:42 we should leave them alone until...
00:44:44 It depends on in what way, but yes.
00:44:46 I mean, that's the general idea.
00:44:47 We should try and elevate the people
00:44:49 who need our help on a physical or mental level.
00:44:53 Maybe not, I don't know how much money
00:44:56 we are dedicating to this in our society.
00:44:58 I don't know what our priorities are,
00:44:59 but I think that it's just a humanitarian
00:45:02 and just not entirely against our interests
00:45:04 or burning money or anything.
00:45:06 I think it's just a nice thing to do
00:45:08 in order to help our general society
00:45:11 be more on level with one another
00:45:14 and be able to achieve the same things as one another.
00:45:16 You're not wrong and I would never say anyone
00:45:18 who wants to do that shouldn't do it.
00:45:20 For example, my mom chose to go
00:45:22 into the special education field.
00:45:23 She knew exactly what she was getting into
00:45:25 and I salute her and I'm proud of her and I love her.
00:45:27 And of course, I respect her decisions, of course.
00:45:32 The problem is when you conflate,
00:45:33 or not not conflate, but we're mixing
00:45:35 between individual specific choices people make
00:45:38 and then just broad policy issues.
00:45:44 I don't believe that men are biologically equal
00:45:49 to women in every single way.
00:45:50 But I know women who are stronger than men.
00:45:54 I mean, of course, that's true
00:45:56 and it happens plenty of times.
00:45:58 It's just, whatever, it doesn't matter.
00:46:00 I'm getting lost in the woods here.
00:46:01 A bunchy...
00:46:02 You're saying different topics here.
00:46:06 I want to talk about something.
00:46:06 I want to shift gears to something
00:46:08 that we were kind of talking before.
00:46:09 DeVu reminded me of, about simplifying the law.
00:46:12 I think one of the major problems
00:46:15 in the United States government
00:46:16 is that it's so fucking old
00:46:19 and all the people in it are so fucking old.
00:46:23 Very, very sure.
00:46:25 The government, like the way I...
00:46:27 That's why I'm voting for Bernie Sanders.
00:46:29 Exactly, this is the youngest person,
00:46:31 the hippest guy in the crowd.
00:46:34 I'm voting Bernie in 2020.
00:46:35 I don't know about you guys.
00:46:36 Bernie's a good man.
00:46:37 Yeah, yeah, when he's six feet fucking under,
00:46:38 we're going to lift him up to the O-locks.
00:46:40 Why the fuck not?
00:46:42 At this point...
00:46:43 I mean, he's what, he's like 74 now,
00:46:45 something like that?
00:46:45 Oh, he's already dead.
00:46:47 No, no, all we got to do,
00:46:48 we just got a weekend at Bernie's, Sanders him.
00:46:53 The entire fucking presidency.
00:46:54 The entire, the entire 2016 election
00:46:57 was just a buildup to that punchline.
00:47:00 Remember everybody out there,
00:47:01 when they start telling you to vote for Joe Biden
00:47:03 instead of Bernie Sanders,
00:47:04 remember Joe Biden is 75,
00:47:06 Bernie Sanders is 76.
00:47:08 Not a big difference there.
00:47:09 Why does Bernie Sanders look so fucking old?
00:47:11 He just looks like an old ass man.
00:47:13 He just, well, Joe Biden is one year younger.
00:47:15 He just happens to look more photogenic and stuff.
00:47:18 Okay, okay, well, it fucking doesn't matter.
00:47:19 I'm an old ass Jew, Bernie Sanders.
00:47:21 Uh, I'm from Brooklyn, motherfuckers.
00:47:22 The way I see the government is like a bunch of bricks,
00:47:26 like tacked on top of one another,
00:47:28 who like, like, like each layer of bricks
00:47:31 is from like a different time period
00:47:32 and like looks completely aesthetically different
00:47:34 to the bricks before,
00:47:35 but they're all laid upon the same foundation.
00:47:38 So when you step back and look at it,
00:47:39 it's just like a hodgepodge, different ideas.
00:47:40 Munchy, I hear you do tear up the Constitution.
00:47:44 We've got to start.
00:47:45 Destroy it, dude.
00:47:46 We've got to start with the service agreement to Minecraft
00:47:49 is the template we should be using.
00:47:51 All right, all right, all right.
00:47:53 Rule number one, all people who are created work equal.
00:47:56 Rule number two, do not mine at nine.
00:47:58 This is broken by the United States of America.
00:48:01 Okay, so like, bro, see the thing about like society,
00:48:04 and I assume basically every culture,
00:48:06 but America is definitely no different,
00:48:08 is that the average person really views the government
00:48:11 as like a magic MacGuffin in like a movie,
00:48:14 but it's like whoever can grab the magic lamp
00:48:17 and then like rub their wish into it in the third act,
00:48:20 like everything will be fine.
00:48:22 Like at the end of fucking Return of the King,
00:48:23 where like, you know, the ground collapses
00:48:25 and conveniently only collapses the bad people, you know?
00:48:28 But that's what we always want.
00:48:29 That's how it's always talked about.
00:48:31 Like I remember like when Obamacare was like very slightly
00:48:35 approved of by the Supreme Court,
00:48:36 people were like, okay, cool, healthcare is free right now, right?
00:48:40 Like, yeah, or like when conversely,
00:48:42 if Obamacare gets obstructed by like one month,
00:48:44 people are like, oh good, healthcare
00:48:46 has improved the capitalist now, right?
00:48:48 Fucking no, I think it's-
00:48:49 You know, Tavu, you're totally right.
00:48:51 Like remember that argument I made a long time ago
00:48:53 about like, shit, what was it?
00:48:56 It was like that we should like,
00:48:58 we want to get on the suicide episode when I said like,
00:49:00 I want like people to like review people
00:49:02 and like approve people before committing suicide.
00:49:06 Like to institute that,
00:49:07 I recognize takes like a magical level of like bureaucracy
00:49:10 that does not exist and can't be relied upon,
00:49:12 but like if it existed and worked perfectly as I envisioned it,
00:49:15 that would be nice, but it's not real.
00:49:17 And I think that this mentality comes from sort of childhood
00:49:19 where you see police officers as just like objective enforcers
00:49:24 of the law, which is this objective power or like,
00:49:26 you know, you go to school and like,
00:49:28 the school is this objective force of knowledge
00:49:31 and teachers just know things, right?
00:49:34 So I think that if we saw not having laws as,
00:49:40 not necessarily a problem, but possibly a solution,
00:49:43 if we always just think of the way to solve problems
00:49:45 as more laws, why can't it ever be-
00:49:47 You know the problem is here?
00:49:48 What?
00:49:49 The problem is we got all these goddamn gamer girls
00:49:51 who think of the goddamn American government as like the,
00:49:55 it's like the code base that was made by the creators
00:49:58 of their favorite game Minecraft, you know, Notch.
00:50:01 They think that like, of course it was crafted perfectly,
00:50:03 to be the most impartial.
00:50:05 You know what it's like?
00:50:05 There's this one scene in I Shield 21.
00:50:07 Okay, this is a great example.
00:50:09 In I Shield 21, there is an exact, there is a moment.
00:50:13 It's a football manga.
00:50:14 It's one of my favorites, it's a sports manga.
00:50:16 The only time, okay, so whatever.
00:50:18 Like in real, like these days,
00:50:20 football is called ref ball in the United States of America
00:50:22 because the refs like interfere with like every fucking play
00:50:24 and throw a million flags and like control the whole game
00:50:27 because of like safety and other shit.
00:50:28 In I Shield 21, every, like the whole game is played,
00:50:32 the whole manga is laid out that people just like do things
00:50:34 and then like a touchdown happened, yay.
00:50:36 And like everyone understands it immediately.
00:50:38 There's never any question.
00:50:39 There was only one moment in the manga
00:50:42 where the issue of the refs is addressed.
00:50:44 And it's this one moment where like the character looks
00:50:47 like he was out of bounds,
00:50:49 but he had actually grabbed some dirt to be in bounds
00:50:51 or something like that.
00:50:52 And like there's a dramatic reveal
00:50:53 as he like looks into the eyes of the ref.
00:50:55 And the left, like stone faced and perfect,
00:50:58 perfectly mechanical and robotic,
00:51:00 looks back into the eyes of Manta,
00:51:01 the guy who had made the play.
00:51:02 All right, he was like trying to get out of bounds
00:51:04 or whatever to stop the clock.
00:51:05 And like they do zooms on face to face to face
00:51:08 and the ref raises his hand
00:51:09 and in perfect recognition of all the facts says,
00:51:12 yes, it was out of bounds.
00:51:13 You are safe to do another play.
00:51:15 You can still win this game, my heroes.
00:51:17 And then he overturns Roe v. Wade.
00:51:19 Like perfect.
00:51:21 Yeah, exactly.
00:51:21 And they think of the government as like perfect
00:51:23 and impartial and always has your best games and minds.
00:51:27 They're constantly complaining
00:51:28 about how bad the government is.
00:51:30 Right, yeah.
00:51:30 Oh, that's, that's true.
00:51:31 No, like I remember, okay, in 2012 or 2011,
00:51:34 it was the 112th Congress or whatever the fuck.
00:51:37 It was the one where Democrats and Republicans
00:51:39 were like half and half.
00:51:40 So like nothing was getting done.
00:51:41 It was obstructionist central,
00:51:43 north, south walking, Zach, fuck, Tobias.
00:51:46 And one of the, I would read articles of like the top 10
00:51:49 reasons why this Congress is the worst Congress ever.
00:51:52 And one of the reasons that they brought up was
00:51:55 this Congress has passed the fewest laws
00:51:59 of any Congress in like 80 years or something.
00:52:01 And I'm like, you know, I hear people talk about, you know,
00:52:06 deregulation, like it's really cool.
00:52:08 But then other people are like,
00:52:09 Oh, deregulation sounds scary.
00:52:11 Like we don't want corporations to do whatever.
00:52:14 But like why not just actually look at the regulations
00:52:17 and look at this on a case by case basis
00:52:19 and consider which ones are reasonable.
00:52:22 I actually, for unrelated reasons, happened to check.
00:52:25 December 2017, the US government had 61,950 pages
00:52:33 of regulations, the federal government,
00:52:35 which apparently is a 25 year low
00:52:38 because of the Trump administration's net negative
00:52:41 on regulations.
00:52:42 But yeah, 61,000 pages, like.
00:52:45 Have you seen the shit they do?
00:52:47 Where like they'll get like a new law
00:52:49 and that they're voting on like an hour
00:52:51 and like all the senators get a copy of it,
00:52:53 like one hour before.
00:52:54 And it's like literally 2000 pages long.
00:52:57 That happens every fucking day that shit's happening.
00:52:59 It's a world.
00:53:00 I mean, I remember some people I've heard people who've said
00:53:02 that they've heard people who've said
00:53:04 that every US citizen breaks three felonies a year.
00:53:09 And there you go.
00:53:10 We live in a world where it's really just all about
00:53:12 selective enforcement.
00:53:14 Lawyers are really the ones who control the control freedom
00:53:17 in the society.
00:53:19 So there you go.
00:53:20 You know what really sucks?
00:53:22 What really fucking sucks?
00:53:24 Working a job.
00:53:25 Let's talk about how fucking gay it is to have a job.
00:53:28 Let's talk about how gay it is to fucking.
00:53:30 We should have an entire episode about that.
00:53:32 I've woken up.
00:53:34 I've woken up for my stupid.
00:53:37 I have a big news for everyone.
00:53:39 That I'm.
00:53:40 Make news change.
00:53:41 I already know this.
00:53:42 Yeah, I got a fucking job.
00:53:44 Oh, right.
00:53:45 Oh, no.
00:53:46 I can imagine it.
00:53:47 I know.
00:53:48 I know.
00:53:49 What a nightmare.
00:53:50 Oh.
00:53:51 That he's betrayed us all.
00:53:51 Life is over.
00:53:52 Well, do you want to talk about what it is?
00:53:54 The neat life continues because it's a work from home thing.
00:53:59 I'm basically just answering calls.
00:54:00 And the reason why I did it.
00:54:02 OK, I used to do online tutoring.
00:54:05 And I would just be hanging out on this tutoring website
00:54:08 waiting for notifications come up that people needed help
00:54:12 with math problems.
00:54:13 And then I would go and walk them through a math problem.
00:54:15 And I would just have that open while I was working on stuff.
00:54:18 And also the physics, right?
00:54:19 So I would kind of split my attention between
00:54:20 doing my art and doing my job.
00:54:22 So I got this job in the hopes that I can kind of do that
00:54:25 and just be like drawing while I'm waiting for calls
00:54:28 and then take a call and do a whole thing
00:54:30 and then go back to doing my shit.
00:54:32 In the hopes that I can have money
00:54:36 but also be working at the same time.
00:54:38 But time will tell.
00:54:39 Time will tell if that pans out.
00:54:42 Yeah, but I'm not just asking you about physics.
00:54:45 Why nothing can go faster than light?
00:54:47 And your answers sounded like a shitty sci-fi novel.
00:54:51 Wait, are you?
00:54:52 When?
00:54:53 It's like a last year or something.
00:54:55 We just were real.
00:54:55 Because real physics is bizarre.
00:54:59 Real physics is a shitty sci-fi novel.
00:55:01 I know, right?
00:55:02 Isn't that fucking weird?
00:55:05 That's God, man.
00:55:06 There he is.
00:55:06 There he is right there, my dude.
00:55:07 How is your production of the only thing
00:55:09 that really matters?
00:55:10 Endless war.
00:55:11 Beast capades.
00:55:12 No, endless war.
00:55:14 Endless war.
00:55:16 I was in training this past week.
00:55:17 And in training, I was like tuning out
00:55:20 and just trying my best to throw together some shitty makeshift code
00:55:25 out of cracks like source code.
00:55:29 Endless war will continue forever.
00:55:31 Endless war is the new hotness.
00:55:32 What is this, an episode of the Rowdy Fuckers Cop Killers?
00:55:34 Get the fuck out of here, guys.
00:55:36 God, the people wish.
00:55:37 The people wish, they.
00:55:38 The people wish.
00:55:39 They will.
00:55:39 I have banned Rowdy Fuckers Cop Killers.
00:55:41 Slime will flow forever.
00:55:43 I have today achieved the dream, the impossible dream.
00:55:46 I now command two mega slime.
00:55:49 Whoa.
00:55:49 Compared to your pitiful one, Munchy.
00:55:51 Hey, hey, hey, hey.
00:55:52 The Rowdy's will fucking rise.
00:55:54 We were catching up to you right and quick.
00:55:56 And this, and that was like, that was only like three people.
00:56:00 Those are only three training sessions that I had
00:56:02 to destroy your pitiful army.
00:56:04 They have no resolve.
00:56:06 Once I put my immense wit and intellect onto the scene,
00:56:09 and I command my troops, like they've been desperately asking me to,
00:56:12 then I will achieve victory in no less than 30 minutes.
00:56:16 I guarantee.
00:56:17 Rowdy Fuckers Cop Killers are banned from now on forever on the PCP.
00:56:21 It's over.
00:56:22 Listen, listen.
00:56:23 All I'm saying is that not yet, this is just a stopgap measure
00:56:28 from when I can make my full-time job developing Endless War,
00:56:32 by which I mean thinking of things to do with Endless War,
00:56:38 trying to do it, failing, and then asking Crack to do it for me.
00:56:42 Endless War, that's your job.
00:56:44 Who are you?
00:56:45 Donald Trump?
00:56:46 Syria?
00:56:46 Am I right or wrong?
00:56:47 Yeah!
00:56:49 There's each other on the back.
00:56:51 Got him.
00:56:53 The actual serious question is, of course,
00:56:55 like I assume you plan to still do comics and stuff.
00:56:58 Yeah, yeah, that's the whole point.
00:57:00 I'm going to be like, my goal is that I can make money
00:57:05 while I like do art kind of intermittently, you know?
00:57:09 Okay, now we're talking about job shit.
00:57:11 You know, trying to shape my life in such a way
00:57:15 that I can get my shit done without, you know,
00:57:17 without neglecting, you know, my stuff.
00:57:20 You're packed.
00:57:21 Ladies and gentlemen, there you have it right there.
00:57:23 Ben taking responsibility for his life,
00:57:25 recognizing he has to make a change, I'm assuming,
00:57:28 in order to reach some financial goal or whatever,
00:57:30 and here he is doing it, all right?
00:57:32 So I don't want to hear no fucking excuses.
00:57:34 If even Ben can do it, anybody can do it.
00:57:37 He needed the second Oculus Rift.
00:57:39 One wasn't enough.
00:57:42 Any one for each eye.
00:57:44 HTC Vive Saint.
00:57:46 Now that would be the one for the modern age.
00:57:48 Guys, that's too advanced.
00:57:50 Let me ask you this.
00:57:51 It's time to Max Revive.
00:57:53 It's me.
00:57:54 Oh, yes.
00:57:56 It's me, Munchy, tripping of the plebs,
00:57:59 the Procrastinator Senate we had before us.
00:58:02 Everyone wants to hear stories.
00:58:04 People want to see the personal raw experiences
00:58:07 about the stories that we've had doing our selective jobs.
00:58:10 And we want to hear Nate groan about,
00:58:12 I don't know, furniture or some shit.
00:58:14 We don't even know about that.
00:58:15 I'm talking about people right now.
00:58:16 Wait a second.
00:58:16 Why have we been talking about philosophy and governments?
00:58:20 None of that matters.
00:58:21 Let's get into where are the memes?
00:58:24 We need the memes.
00:58:25 He's right.
00:58:27 Was Davoo saying something there?
00:58:28 Nate, I was just thinking, you already
00:58:29 have such a messianic complex.
00:58:31 Does that have anything to do with making furniture out of wood,
00:58:34 being like a carpenter or some shit?
00:58:38 Well, you know, it's like, so I guess the job I was referring to there
00:58:41 was, like I said before, working at Pier 1,
00:58:43 worked at Pier 1 for a year or two.
00:58:46 My job was, I did some of that up front,
00:58:48 just people buying shit.
00:58:50 Your job was basically like push sales of all kinds of bullshit.
00:58:54 But what I much prefer to do, my favorite thing to do there,
00:58:57 which was sort of my main responsibility was,
00:59:01 Pier 1 is to some degree a furniture store.
00:59:05 So we would get these big boxes of furniture in,
00:59:07 and it would be my job.
00:59:08 And then there were other guys who would come in.
00:59:10 It was all women who worked there.
00:59:12 But then the guys who worked there were the ones
00:59:14 who would build the furniture, just because we were bigger, I guess.
00:59:19 And so I would just sit in the back.
00:59:20 I would open up box after box after box and assemble,
00:59:24 like Ikea style, extremely simple furniture pieces to put together.
00:59:28 And I would sit there, and I would commune with God,
00:59:32 and my halo would appear, and I would invent the table.
00:59:37 I am Jesus, is what I'm saying.
00:59:39 Guys, remember in fucking Passion of the Christ at the beginning
00:59:44 when Jesus literally invents the long legged table?
00:59:47 Yes.
00:59:47 Is that true?
00:59:48 Did that happen in that movie?
00:59:49 It starts out, someone is like...
00:59:51 Gibson.
00:59:52 Someone is like, wow, what is this weird table you're making, Jesus?
00:59:55 He's like, oh, see, it's got long legs, but you sit at taller chairs.
01:00:00 And the guy's like, oh, it'll never catch on.
01:00:02 Did I talk with you guys, I don't think I did.
01:00:05 Just so happened a week ago, I was just sitting in the back of the car,
01:00:08 I think, yeah, with my parents, this was a few weeks ago,
01:00:11 my parents are in the car, like my sister's in the car,
01:00:14 and I'm just sort of sitting in the back seat,
01:00:16 and just randomly accessing memories in my brain.
01:00:20 And I remember having seen the beginning of the Passion of the Christ,
01:00:23 which I hadn't seen since I was like a kid.
01:00:25 So I didn't really, at the time I took that scene for granted,
01:00:28 but now I'm like, what the fuck?
01:00:30 It's like one of those like time travel movies
01:00:32 where like someone bumps into Ben Franklin, you know,
01:00:34 and it's like, oh man, you know, you should put a key in a bottle or some shit.
01:00:37 But it's like a Jesus movie, you know?
01:00:39 Like, it's a fucking Jesus movie where like,
01:00:42 it's not only that he died for our sins,
01:00:45 but he also invented the long-legged table.
01:00:47 Is there any evidence that there is a connection there?
01:00:51 That Jesus didn't invent the long-legged table.
01:00:54 Yeah, it's not the fuck up haters, I want to hear it.
01:00:56 We just seem to sit a little bit closer to heaven,
01:00:59 and Jesus was there.
01:00:59 There you go!
01:01:00 Yeah!
01:01:01 Woo-hoo!
01:01:02 Oh, god damn.
01:01:04 So guys, what do you say?
01:01:05 Radcon 4, we have the last supper.
01:01:07 We make long-legged tables!
01:01:10 We invent the even longer-legged table.
01:01:13 So we can get closer to Jesus!
01:01:16 Yes!
01:01:16 It's the PCP, the Pro Carpenters podcast.
01:01:20 Whoa, soon, soon.
01:01:22 The Pro Christenators podcast.
01:01:24 I don't personally have much more to say about that job,
01:01:28 but that was the job that I worked while I was making
01:01:31 Gern-Loggin video, part one and part two.
01:01:33 So like, I would buy day, I'd be fucking building furniture
01:01:36 and selling people shit at Pier 1,
01:01:38 and I'd come home, and I would work on-
01:01:40 And you'd be building mines.
01:01:41 I'd be mining.
01:01:42 What fucking motivates you?
01:01:44 What is it inside of you that makes you go building furniture?
01:01:48 Before you answer that, I want to say to Javu,
01:01:51 Radcon 4, Jesus lecture,
01:01:53 where you explain the history and life of Jesus Christ.
01:01:58 I don't know.
01:01:59 I think I probably could have my dad do that lecture, but...
01:02:02 Yeah, okay.
01:02:02 Yeah, yeah, okay.
01:02:04 Wait, what's the fire that's lit under your ass that makes you go,
01:02:07 I'm gonna make this whole video on this shitty laptop?
01:02:11 You know what it is?
01:02:12 It's fear.
01:02:15 For me, it's fear.
01:02:16 A lot of things are motivated by fear,
01:02:17 a lot of things are motivated by fear,
01:02:18 and there's probably some degree of that,
01:02:20 like fear of like being unworthy in life,
01:02:23 and like allowing myself to...
01:02:25 Fear of looking back and regretting all the things you didn't do.
01:02:29 Yeah.
01:02:29 That's what motivates me.
01:02:32 That's a fair, it's a fair thing.
01:02:33 It's a fair thing, and I think that's kind of helpful.
01:02:35 I don't fear that, I'm living that.
01:02:36 That's my life.
01:02:37 Well, there you go.
01:02:39 I guess, like, I don't know,
01:02:41 a lot of it really does come from, like,
01:02:43 when I was growing up, I just felt shitty about myself,
01:02:48 and just like I wasn't doing it.
01:02:50 Like, I don't know, like it really,
01:02:51 I know it's weird as I come back to a lot,
01:02:53 but a lot of it comes back to, I think, my issues with women,
01:02:56 and like how I felt like such a failure,
01:02:58 and that I was completely failing when all my friends were like,
01:03:00 superior to me, and then I realized I didn't want to be,
01:03:04 nor did I have to be inferior anymore.
01:03:05 Like, I could fix myself, and then I did.
01:03:08 And then once I did that, I was like,
01:03:10 well, let's keep this train rolling, I think.
01:03:12 Like, and like, I don't want to take all credit.
01:03:14 Like, Ben is the one who suggested
01:03:16 we even make videos in the first place.
01:03:18 So he's the one who like turned me on to even the possibility
01:03:21 of doing this kind of stuff.
01:03:22 Nailed it.
01:03:23 It was good, I'm sure glad it happened.
01:03:25 And then, just when I was in it,
01:03:26 I discovered how much I enjoyed doing it,
01:03:29 and then, I don't know, man.
01:03:30 Like, it's like that particular video series or whatever.
01:03:33 I just really liked that show.
01:03:34 I was mad that people were explaining it poorly,
01:03:36 and I like wanted to correct the record.
01:03:38 But the real thing at the root of it.
01:03:40 That particular show whose name must not be mentioned.
01:03:44 Indeed, indeed.
01:03:45 The Bolton Mortyve anime.
01:03:48 That's what they call it.
01:03:50 I guess I just really have things I want to achieve in life.
01:03:54 Like, these days, I spend a pretty large amount of time
01:03:57 thinking about how I admire Cenk Juger of the Young Turks.
01:04:02 And I know that's a weird guy to pick out of a hat.
01:04:06 But apart from the political issues I strongly disagree with him on,
01:04:10 I look at this guy who was some fat, virgin, 25-year-old asshole
01:04:15 who was a super political nerd.
01:04:17 But now, he's got a huge network and a huge successful business
01:04:22 where he works with all these fascinating people.
01:04:24 He gets to meet all these amazing people
01:04:26 and do all these cool things.
01:04:27 He's not in as good of shape as he could be,
01:04:29 so I'm gonna be working on that.
01:04:32 But I really spend a lot of my time thinking about
01:04:36 the male role models in my life I want to be like.
01:04:39 And just try to live the way they would, I guess.
01:04:42 I spend a lot of my time thinking about how the Penny Arcade guys live
01:04:48 and how I want to live like them.
01:04:50 And how I'm closer than I ever thought I would be.
01:04:53 But there's still a long way to go.
01:04:55 I mean, and I think about Red Letter Media too,
01:04:57 just whatever, I know we talk about them a lot, but that's...
01:04:59 The Penny Arcade guys, they fucking built an intellectual property
01:05:04 that now has turned, and they expanded their operations
01:05:08 and they turned into these media juggernauts.
01:05:10 And what the end result of that is that now,
01:05:14 they can spend like literally one hundred, well not one hundred,
01:05:16 like so much of their time can be devoted to them
01:05:18 just pursuing whatever they want to do.
01:05:21 Like Tyco can just go and fucking make raps with that other guy.
01:05:24 And that's fine, and they can fucking bullshit around
01:05:27 with their stupid Boy Scouts in the Woods D&D setting
01:05:31 that nobody cares about, but it's totally fine
01:05:33 and I'm sure they have a great time with it.
01:05:35 And that's how I want to live, just fucking around and doing whatever I want.
01:05:39 These guys have added a ton of value to the world
01:05:41 and now they get to enjoy the benefits.
01:05:42 Like they fucking...
01:05:43 The first thing I was real, like I was always aware of...
01:05:46 What's the name of their comic?
01:05:47 Penny Arcade, it's called Penny Arcade, right?
01:05:51 It's just like you showed me, what was that show?
01:05:53 Strip Search.
01:05:54 Strip Search.
01:05:55 Yeah, that's the kind of thing they can just do on a whim.
01:05:58 And like if they hadn't spent like a decade or decades or whatever it was,
01:06:02 like building up themselves to the point where they had the resources
01:06:05 to like create that show that they probably never even imagined
01:06:08 they'd be making like at the start.
01:06:10 It's because they gave themselves power.
01:06:12 I'll say it man, I'm in it for power.
01:06:14 I want the power to control my life and do fun things I want to do.
01:06:18 Yeah, exactly.
01:06:19 Yeah, that's what I'm in for, that's what I'm doing.
01:06:21 For me, it's really like a holy war in the name of proliferating the art and society,
01:06:29 but mostly just art that I want there to be.
01:06:32 But in my honor, right?
01:06:34 Like when I hear, whenever I read up or watch YouTube videos
01:06:39 about the fucking Roman warriors, I'm like, they have my mentality.
01:06:43 Maybe we're the same number of skirts, probably.
01:06:46 And like...
01:06:47 You know what they called, if I remember correctly,
01:06:50 the Roman soldiers, DeVu?
01:06:52 Legionnaires.
01:06:54 DeVu is Legion, is the joke I'm trying to make.
01:06:56 Yes, I am.
01:06:57 All right.
01:06:58 Forgot about that one.
01:06:58 Discrystallize to my mind.
01:06:59 Where are the memes?
01:07:00 Where have all the memes gone?
01:07:01 I'm doing my best.
01:07:02 They have, they have, no, they have, yeah, they've fallen into obscurity.
01:07:06 They need to be max-revived.
01:07:07 You know what they called, you know what they called Roman soldiers back in the day?
01:07:10 They called them DeVus.
01:07:12 That's what we're doing right now.
01:07:13 Did you know?
01:07:16 So fucking like, I mean, I think it's pretty appropriate.
01:07:20 My fucking fiance, she's always complaining about her sister, whose name is Sam,
01:07:23 and one of her ex-friends, whose name is Sam.
01:07:25 And I'm like, you're in the Samnite Wars.
01:07:28 The first and second Samnite Wars.
01:07:29 And it's like, do you think of in any language that isn't Roman history?
01:07:33 And I'm like, no.
01:07:36 Wait, is that a real word?
01:07:37 Samnite?
01:07:38 Yeah, the fucking Romans kick the show of the Samnites.
01:07:43 Oh, did the Samnites have jobs?
01:07:45 Any fucking fucking antiquity history buffs laugh at that joke, you see?
01:07:51 I'm sure they did.
01:07:51 I mean, I'm sure they did.
01:07:52 You have to cast a shitload of stupid miniature nets to get random people in the audience,
01:07:58 you see.
01:07:59 You know, the PCB has splintered into minuscule individualized memes for different groups
01:08:04 to appreciate.
01:08:04 Yeah, it's fucking literally going around.
01:08:05 That's what we're going to press the groups for to toilet.
01:08:07 Yes.
01:08:08 Like the history buffs.
01:08:09 Like the history buffs.
01:08:09 Every audience member is sitting waiting.
01:08:11 When will my memes come?
01:08:13 Yeah.
01:08:14 All right.
01:08:14 I'm going to sit through all these.
01:08:15 All these bargain memes.
01:08:17 It's the Disney princess mentality.
01:08:18 Like your group isn't real and doesn't really exist or no one gives a shit unless you have
01:08:23 a Disney princess associated with your ethnic or religious group.
01:08:26 That's how it works.
01:08:27 That's how it works.
01:08:28 We're never going to get into the Muslim Disney princess.
01:08:30 I'm waiting.
01:08:30 Well, there's Jasmine.
01:08:31 There's Jasmine.
01:08:32 Yeah.
01:08:32 She's not.
01:08:33 She's not a good Christian wife.
01:08:36 Look at what she's wearing, Nate.
01:08:38 Come on.
01:08:38 Well, okay, goddamn.
01:08:40 Back to the topic here.
01:08:42 This mentality in myself was finally I understood.
01:08:44 Jasmine is Islamic.
01:08:46 That's the topic of the podcast.
01:08:48 Okay, I'm sorry.
01:08:49 I'm sorry.
01:08:49 We could debate whether or not Jasmine is a Muslim for ages.
01:08:53 We could never reach a consensus.
01:08:54 Jasmine versus Islam, the new bonus episode.
01:08:58 That's a good one.
01:08:58 That's a good one.
01:09:00 When Hippo was saying in the chat earlier that, you know,
01:09:04 when I really think about it, creating a cult around myself like developing hardcore fans
01:09:10 is really just exactly the same as getting the algorithms.
01:09:16 You're basically just doing a humiliating rain dance
01:09:19 and tooling your content and persona to get a certain specific result.
01:09:23 Neither one of them is doing what you want to do as an artist.
01:09:27 Right?
01:09:28 It's kind of the way he was putting it.
01:09:30 But you get, if you've got a following that gives you power
01:09:34 and having power lets you do the things that you want to do.
01:09:36 And doing what you want will lead to success
01:09:42 if you just do it consistently and you work hard.
01:09:45 Guys, can I, I'm sorry, I'm sorry to cut in.
01:09:47 Can I just bring you a brief moment of joy
01:09:49 that just happened in real time in my life while I was on this podcast?
01:09:53 I get a message from Michelle that who just says-
01:09:56 Thanks, a father-in-law.
01:09:58 Let's go to the board.
01:09:59 It's just that she says, someone, she's at work right now.
01:10:02 I picked her up yesterday.
01:10:04 She just sent me by saying, hey, Nate, just thought you should know.
01:10:06 Someone just asked me, hey, Michelle,
01:10:08 were you here with the big muscular bodybuilder last night?
01:10:11 And they literally asked if I was a bodybuilder.
01:10:15 I know I don't deserve it, but it makes me feel good, okay?
01:10:18 Fuck off.
01:10:19 All right, I'm sorry.
01:10:20 Nate, I really like this idea of Nate having a kid.
01:10:24 And the moment I thought of Nate having a kid,
01:10:26 I was reminded of this YouTube Barats and Barretta skit
01:10:30 where there's this guy who's training his year and a half old daughter
01:10:33 to be a world-class Olympian and giving her weights
01:10:36 and throwing her all around.
01:10:37 That's what I will do with all my children.
01:10:39 That sounds like Nate.
01:10:39 That's what I will do.
01:10:40 Yes.
01:10:40 No, I'll do it.
01:10:41 I will show you that score.
01:10:42 You played that explicitly, the horrific regimen you have planned out.
01:10:48 To make sure your kids can be all they can be.
01:10:51 Well, listen, Ben, exactly as you said, delay gratification.
01:10:54 I will delay all gratification for my children until they are 18.
01:10:57 They will not know an ounce of happiness or joy in their life
01:11:00 until they reach the age of 18.
01:11:02 My children will have the ultimate coom when they leave the nest
01:11:05 and they realize they are so much better than all these scum out there
01:11:08 in the fucking world who did not wear fucking training masks
01:11:12 and weights for this time they were one fucking day old.
01:11:14 They'll know no pleasure until they rip the still beating heart
01:11:18 from your enemy's breasts.
01:11:19 That's right.
01:11:20 A.K. me.
01:11:20 I will be their adversary.
01:11:22 The joy and rage and the soul of weird utilitarianism.
01:11:23 When they conquer me, they go to be transcended.
01:11:26 That's the end goal.
01:11:27 That's the end goal.
01:11:28 Every weird utilitarianism is doomed to be killed by his own children.
01:11:31 Who lives in permanent antagonism with.
01:11:33 That would be the final challenge.
01:11:35 The day they reach 18, you'll stand in front of the door
01:11:37 and you'll have your back turned to them
01:11:39 and you'll slowly turn around and be like,
01:11:40 your final challenge is to defeat me in hand to hand combat.
01:11:44 And they'll be like, what, dad?
01:11:46 And meanwhile, while they're stuttering,
01:11:48 you make your first move and stab your son through his heart.
01:11:52 You should have acted sooner.
01:11:53 You slow pussy, too fucking slow.
01:11:55 Luckily, I've got several clones of you lined up in 2016
01:11:59 where you fucking failed.
01:12:00 Number 27, get the fuck dead.
01:12:03 That's what I'll say.
01:12:04 That's what I'll say.
01:12:05 It'll be great.
01:12:06 You'll say, get in the ground, you fucking nigger.
01:12:08 There, that's what it'll be.
01:12:10 That's what it'll be.
01:12:10 Because this is my wife's son, just to clarify.
01:12:12 Um, you know.
01:12:13 This is not yet.
01:12:15 That's what it is.
01:12:15 That's what it is.
01:12:18 All right.
01:12:19 Where were, well, jobs, right?
01:12:21 Yeah, I was talking to you.
01:12:22 My wife's full-time job is to stay at home, dad,
01:12:25 to my wife's son.
01:12:26 Is my full-time job is what I'm doing every day.
01:12:29 Please don't bully me.
01:12:30 This is a real job.
01:12:31 Someone has to do it.
01:12:32 God damn it, I deserve respect.
01:12:33 I'm a human being.
01:12:34 That's it.
01:12:35 Someone has to do it.
01:12:35 We all know, we all know that Tarone can't do it.
01:12:38 We, yeah, I just got to take up,
01:12:39 I just got to take up the main tool.
01:12:40 Yeah.
01:12:41 Yeah, that's right.
01:12:41 Ben, you've done jobs before.
01:12:43 You were just talking about jobs.
01:12:44 Yeah.
01:12:46 Should I list them?
01:12:48 Yes.
01:12:48 Yeah, that sounds fun.
01:12:48 Let's all list our jobs.
01:12:49 Okay, let's list our jobs.
01:12:50 I like that.
01:12:51 Well, let's see.
01:12:51 When I was in high school,
01:12:52 I worked at Mrs. Fields Cookies in the mall.
01:12:55 Yeah, yeah.
01:12:56 I worked.
01:12:57 You drew fancy designs on them.
01:12:59 I remember that.
01:12:59 Yeah, it was really fun, actually.
01:13:01 It was like way fun when I had to decorate cakes.
01:13:04 I was a counselor at Astro Camp for like six months there.
01:13:10 I worked at, I was a food runner.
01:13:12 After that was over, I was a food runner
01:13:14 at this restaurant called the Chateau
01:13:16 that actually we just went to when we were in Boston.
01:13:18 Oh yeah, it was nice.
01:13:19 Yeah, yeah, I worked at that restaurant.
01:13:21 And I actually, this was like eight years ago
01:13:23 or like seven years ago.
01:13:24 And I saw people there that I barely recognized
01:13:27 out of the corner of my mind.
01:13:28 I was like, oh my God, they're still here.
01:13:29 Oh no.
01:13:30 They escaped, but they're still here.
01:13:33 So that was harrowing.
01:13:36 God, what the fuck?
01:13:37 I don't know.
01:13:37 I was a, I don't know.
01:13:39 I had a bunch of shitty little jobs.
01:13:40 Fucking Poland, fucking Poland, job.
01:13:41 I was like a, I did like document editing
01:13:44 for some company.
01:13:45 I was just like editing,
01:13:45 that I would, I did that from home for the most.
01:13:47 I had a cubicle in an office,
01:13:49 but I almost never went to it.
01:13:50 I mostly just worked it from home.
01:13:51 They would send me assignments,
01:13:52 I would do them, send it back,
01:13:53 but a bing, but a boom.
01:13:54 I was like sort of an engineer,
01:13:56 but mostly I just like,
01:13:58 mostly I just like took readings
01:13:59 off of an electron microscope
01:14:01 at this place called Integris in Bilarica,
01:14:05 Bilarica, whatever.
01:14:06 I never learned how to say the town's name.
01:14:09 And I think there's more.
01:14:11 Oh, I was.
01:14:11 The Poland one.
01:14:12 What about Poland?
01:14:13 Oh yeah, yeah.
01:14:14 And then I taught,
01:14:14 I taught physics to, to Arab kids in Poland.
01:14:19 Several months.
01:14:21 Yes.
01:14:22 Nice, nice.
01:14:22 I think that's a pretty exhaustive list of my jobs.
01:14:26 Ben, the real mental powerhouse behind 9-11,
01:14:29 you can thank him for its success.
01:14:31 Yeah.
01:14:32 This was post 9-11.
01:14:34 Of course.
01:14:34 Oh, okay.
01:14:35 They were all in very high spirits.
01:14:40 I can't imagine what it must have been like
01:14:42 to be alive during 9-11
01:14:44 and like being able to like,
01:14:45 like perceive it as being true.
01:14:48 That's incredible.
01:14:48 Yeah, I would say that for me is the dividing line
01:14:51 between like millennials and then millennial 2.0s.
01:14:55 If you don't remember distinctly 9-11 happening,
01:14:58 then you're.
01:14:58 I'll tell you right now, Munchie,
01:14:59 you missed a hell of a party.
01:15:01 You missed a hell of a good time.
01:15:02 I know, I know.
01:15:02 I wish I had been there.
01:15:03 I was, I was just in the plane.
01:15:04 I was having too, I was dead when I go to attend to.
01:15:08 Hey, I'll just run through my jobs real fast
01:15:10 because we're all doing it.
01:15:12 My first job was I worked for our next door neighbor Ralph
01:15:15 and I worked, like he had like a big party,
01:15:18 like he had a big fucking bit of land
01:15:21 in front of his house.
01:15:22 Or like he would hold like events.
01:15:23 So people would like have weddings there
01:15:25 and they'd like do stuff like that.
01:15:26 I worked there as like a caterer
01:15:28 and just like a guy who would stand around
01:15:30 and like watch and like make sure and clean up stuff.
01:15:32 And I worked there for like a couple months.
01:15:34 That was on and off.
01:15:35 I got a job at Papa Gino's Pizzeria.
01:15:40 That's the good shit.
01:15:40 That's my favorite kind of pizza.
01:15:41 To this day.
01:15:42 So in your dad's man, that's pretty.
01:15:44 Oh yeah, there will be a stealing your dad on Papa Gino's.
01:15:48 I'm very excited.
01:15:48 I want to watch that.
01:15:49 I want to know, I want to know an in-depth review
01:15:51 of this Papa Gino's pizza, which I'm sure you will do.
01:15:54 Oh, we get deeper in depth than you have ever
01:15:57 dwelled before.
01:15:58 Let me see.
01:15:59 In, I think that was the last job I did before college.
01:16:02 In college, I worked as a librarian
01:16:04 at our award-winning school library
01:16:06 at the College of New Jersey where I went.
01:16:08 That's my alma mater.
01:16:12 Also while I was working there,
01:16:13 I got like a small little gig
01:16:15 to like make a program for a guy that he paid me for.
01:16:19 I just didn't do it though.
01:16:21 That's really the long and short of it.
01:16:22 What was the program supposed to be?
01:16:25 You know, I can't even remember what the point of it was,
01:16:27 but like I basically, this is my first quote-unquote job
01:16:30 as a programmer.
01:16:31 The guy, like I met him through my job at the library.
01:16:33 He just was like, hey, I want to like this thing to do this.
01:16:37 And we had a couple meetings
01:16:38 and then like a couple months passed
01:16:39 when I was supposed to be working on it.
01:16:41 And I just presented him like the fuck all that I'd done.
01:16:43 He was like, wow, this is like terrible.
01:16:45 This is not, you did not do the work.
01:16:47 And I'm just like, no, I did a good job.
01:16:49 I'm really good.
01:16:51 I deeply ashamed of it to this day.
01:16:53 Beyond that, I think after college,
01:16:57 I just got a job at,
01:16:58 I worked at a pizza place for a little while,
01:17:00 making some shitty ass pizzas for this like mom and pop place.
01:17:03 They were, they were a,
01:17:04 Hoptic Christian Egyptians.
01:17:06 They were cool.
01:17:07 They loved Jesus.
01:17:08 They loved-
01:17:09 I'm the only one who thinks Hoptic is.
01:17:11 That might be the wrong word.
01:17:13 Whatever.
01:17:13 They were just like super Christ-faggy Egyptians.
01:17:15 They had haptic technology.
01:17:17 They didn't have a brain uncontrollably.
01:17:18 Yeah, like touch.
01:17:19 I would feel them and they would, you know,
01:17:20 respond to my touch in real time.
01:17:23 That's not the pizza's homemade.
01:17:26 I asked the man to tell me the secret recipe for his secret sauce
01:17:30 and he would not tell me.
01:17:31 He would not tell me.
01:17:32 He started to unbuckle his pants.
01:17:33 And you're like, actually, I don't need to know that bad.
01:17:35 Yeah, that's how it went.
01:17:37 So I worked there.
01:17:38 Then I worked at Best Buy for like a year or two.
01:17:42 That was okay.
01:17:43 I had some amazing fucking stories
01:17:45 about the things that happened in that fucking place.
01:17:48 That's where I met the guy who I had literally the moment
01:17:51 that made me realize all weed was bad and evil forever at that job.
01:17:56 I was just around these people who were just big weed guys
01:17:58 and recognized I never wanted to be around them ever again
01:18:00 or anyone like them.
01:18:02 ParkourDude91 was such an unbelievable good experience for me
01:18:11 to see in real time this person hopped up
01:18:15 on weed doing bad things.
01:18:17 It doesn't matter that it was all fake and not real.
01:18:19 That doesn't matter.
01:18:20 That's not a problem.
01:18:21 It's your only reason to imagine it.
01:18:23 As long as...
01:18:24 It instilled in me the knowledge, the knowledge,
01:18:27 the objective true fact that weed makes you retarded.
01:18:31 And I'm so stretched this day.
01:18:33 Thank you so fucking much, ParkourDude.
01:18:36 You've done a real solid for me.
01:18:37 You saved one from that green hell known as the M life.
01:18:42 That was one of the reasons why he wanted to do it.
01:18:45 Was to portray gamer weed culture as terrible.
01:18:49 And in literal hopes to inspire people to not be the person he was presenting.
01:18:53 Is he on record just saying that?
01:18:55 Is that true?
01:18:55 Yeah, yeah, that's true.
01:18:56 Dude, right after we recorded that lecture,
01:19:00 Munchie took us upstairs and showed us the video
01:19:02 where he reveals himself as a fake.
01:19:04 And then he goes on his diatribe explaining his motivations.
01:19:07 And I'm like, oh, ParkourDude's mission was born out of hatred and contempt.
01:19:12 It wasn't just lighthearted poking fun at.
01:19:14 He's like really seriously despises the kind of thing he was parodying.
01:19:19 And he was just going full tilt propaganda against it.
01:19:22 Holy shit.
01:19:23 Nate, I feel like you would really like Yann Rinkowski.
01:19:26 I mean, because he is, he's like, I feel like both him and Sam Hyde
01:19:32 are like, like, like, like they moonlight in philosophy.
01:19:35 But I think Yann is really like, Yann really has a principle that I really enjoy.
01:19:40 And I try and do, but I'm not very good at it.
01:19:42 And I need, I've been thinking about it and I want to do it more.
01:19:44 Where your comedy is rooted in the things that you believe.
01:19:48 And like your, your comedy is rooted in like, like how you want to perceive reality.
01:19:55 That is 100% true.
01:19:56 And I think about that a lot when I'm, when I'm trying to do stuff.
01:20:00 Yeah.
01:20:00 When I, I, I kind of think that comedy without that is just inherently less valuable.
01:20:06 But, you know, whatever, I can just say just goof for the sake of a goof.
01:20:09 Hey, let me just finish my last jobs here.
01:20:12 All I did, I worked at peer one and now I got my current programming job.
01:20:15 And that's it.
01:20:15 So I'm, I'm, I'm done.
01:20:16 I'm out.
01:20:17 It's all my jobs.
01:20:19 Um, um, David, you, you, you clone some Wondos, right?
01:20:23 What?
01:20:25 Yeah, that's all I've done.
01:20:26 I've never actually had a real job.
01:20:28 I just fucking worked with my dad on cleaning windows and cleaning out gutters.
01:20:32 Yeah.
01:20:32 Really interesting because looking back, I think I,
01:20:36 the, the, the way in which I ran at YouTube clearly reflects that job because that job was
01:20:43 totally unfulfilling, but like totally not stressful.
01:20:47 Cause when it's just, you know, you, you're there and your fucking dad and your brother,
01:20:51 it's not like you have to like put on a huge.
01:20:52 When you're there and you're fucking your dad and your brother understood.
01:20:55 I'm with you, dude.
01:20:56 I'm with you.
01:20:56 I only gotta be professional.
01:20:57 I only gotta like be professional attitude when there's a fucking customer there.
01:21:01 You know, that's fine.
01:21:02 Yeah.
01:21:03 Yeah.
01:21:03 But it was, it was pretty low pressure, right?
01:21:06 And it's a pretty easy job to do.
01:21:08 Like the thing about the reason why my dad has a successful business doing that is that
01:21:12 no one wants to clean the windows, which is why you can never get a consistent employee.
01:21:16 Like, you know when you can never get a decent window cleaner,
01:21:19 but if it's someone who's in your family, then they have to give a shit.
01:21:23 Like it was weird watching like familial bonds for sweet actually do a good job,
01:21:29 even though I openly didn't give a shit.
01:21:31 The point is, despite being very like physically draining, it wasn't that draining.
01:21:36 And it wasn't like emotionally or psychologically draining because
01:21:40 you can just be like, oh, hey, I have 20 windows to clean right here.
01:21:43 Pops into your buds, listens to entire podcasts.
01:21:46 So it's pretty easy.
01:21:48 So I had plenty of time to like think all day.
01:21:50 So it was actually a pretty easy, a pretty great job to then transition into being an internet person.
01:21:56 But also it took my very specific mentality of absolutely hating it.
01:22:01 If I'm spending any time not doing what I want to do and thinking that I'm making something
01:22:05 important that I actually give a shit about.
01:22:07 If I spend any time not doing that, I want to die.
01:22:10 So, you know, I feel you on that.
01:22:12 But incidentally, speaking of family jobs, I totally forgot about this.
01:22:14 I was the guy who filed my dad's paperwork for a long time.
01:22:19 I totally forgot about it.
01:22:20 But yeah, I remember filing dad's paperwork.
01:22:23 Yeah, I actually kind of loved it because I get to watch Star Trek while I do it.
01:22:27 And I did that all day.
01:22:28 I would listen to podcasts while doing it.
01:22:32 I hated doing it because I was like, man, I could be spending my time so much better
01:22:35 because he would pay like $8 an hour.
01:22:37 Yeah, my dad would do that kind of stuff too, even before he did that business.
01:22:41 He'd be like, hey.
01:22:42 Honestly, I would not have done it even though he was paying me.
01:22:44 But like he kind of like insisted that we do it.
01:22:48 Yeah, well, hey, we were living with his house rent-free.
01:22:50 So yeah, yeah.
01:22:51 I guess it was pretty good of him to pay anything.
01:22:55 True.
01:22:55 Tom.
01:22:58 Okay, so my first job was in high school and I went to Papageno's just like Nate did.
01:23:04 I worked there just to buy a computer because I didn't have.
01:23:07 Tom, let's literally open a Papageno's franchise, just you and me.
01:23:10 We should.
01:23:12 We're old school employees.
01:23:13 My mom and dad, their first job was both Sonic.
01:23:18 They both worked at the Sonic restaurant as their first job.
01:23:20 Oh, yeah?
01:23:21 Is that how they met?
01:23:22 No, they met each other like decades later or like 15 years later,
01:23:25 but they still like that was that just coincidence, right?
01:23:28 But they still worked at Sonic.
01:23:30 No.
01:23:33 All right.
01:23:34 So sorry, Tom, didn't mean that.
01:23:35 It's all good.
01:23:36 Papageno's the first job.
01:23:37 Then I went to college and I worked at the cafeteria at the school for a while making sandwiches.
01:23:46 And then I also did like the desk thing like where you like sign people into like the dorms
01:23:50 and stuff.
01:23:51 I did that for a while.
01:23:53 And then I got a job at Apple while I was in school.
01:23:56 So I would go down the street to the mall and I'd work as the guy who like you talked to
01:24:00 you about computers and shit.
01:24:01 And I did that for like almost all the Apple geniuses.
01:24:04 That's pretty cool.
01:24:05 You were an Apple genius.
01:24:06 I was like the specialist.
01:24:08 That was the one who like sold you stuff.
01:24:09 I wanted to be a genius, but they're like, you got to work your way up to that.
01:24:13 But yeah, I did that.
01:24:14 It was it's funny because like to this day, everything that I've done, like when I've gone
01:24:19 in to talk to people about jobs, everyone's like floored that I work for Apple.
01:24:22 They're like, what the fuck?
01:24:24 Did you design the Galaxy S5?
01:24:28 God, I wish.
01:24:29 Dude, look at my iPhone.
01:24:30 Was this you?
01:24:31 Was this you, Tom?
01:24:32 Just tell me.
01:24:33 Yeah.
01:24:33 When you see the jobs died, I go.
01:24:34 Put it together.
01:24:36 Yeah, that was me.
01:24:37 Okay.
01:24:39 So I did that.
01:24:41 Then I worked during the summers at Handsome Air Force Base.
01:24:44 My dad, we're not with him.
01:24:46 I was like in a totally different building doing something completely unrelated.
01:24:49 But I did that for a while.
01:24:52 Then when I got out of school, I worked at Best Buy for the season.
01:24:55 And it was.
01:24:56 Hey, are we the same guy?
01:24:58 Yes.
01:24:59 We are the best and worst guy ever.
01:25:00 That's the dynamic.
01:25:03 This runs so deep.
01:25:06 It's so deep, dude.
01:25:07 We need to do our best guy, worst guy podcast.
01:25:09 That'll be great.
01:25:09 That's a great.
01:25:10 That's a fun truth.
01:25:10 Oh my God, literally.
01:25:11 That should be what happens.
01:25:13 I agree.
01:25:14 The communists on the capitalist finally clash.
01:25:16 Oh, no.
01:25:18 Those two ideologies finally get compared to each other after all these years.
01:25:24 I don't think the universe could handle it, but.
01:25:26 Cold War II begins.
01:25:30 By the way, oh, continue, Tom.
01:25:33 I was just going to say after that, I went to Staples for a little bit and that sucked.
01:25:36 Then I went to Whole Foods and I was like a sign maker.
01:25:40 I did like graphic design and stuff there.
01:25:42 And that was nice.
01:25:43 I worked there.
01:25:43 We got our legendary groceries for Radcon.
01:25:48 No, no, no, no, no, no, the first, the first place that me and Tom went to.
01:25:56 No, I don't think we went to Whole Foods.
01:25:59 We went to Star Market, which is like the total opposite of Whole Foods.
01:26:03 Whole Foods is like a high organic food place.
01:26:08 And that was like the healthiest I'd ever been when I worked at Whole Foods.
01:26:10 I had to do nothing but eat food there.
01:26:13 But the only thing I got afforded to eat was Caesar salads because it was so expensive.
01:26:17 So I ate nothing but Caesar salad for like a year and I lost a ton of weight and it was great.
01:26:24 But I lost that job because I was like too...
01:26:30 Retarded.
01:26:30 Yeah, retarded.
01:26:32 No, I was like, I was trying to do too much.
01:26:33 Like I'd try and like solve problems and maybe like get fucked.
01:26:37 And eventually we're just like, we're tired of you trying to solve problems.
01:26:39 Get out here.
01:26:40 We want to be shit.
01:26:41 Uh, that sounds slightly like a simplification.
01:26:45 You were, you were too...
01:26:47 Maybe you overextended yourself and then got not enough done or something.
01:26:50 No, like the problem was that like I would
01:26:53 suggest ways of making things better.
01:26:55 And they didn't want anybody to rock the boat, I guess.
01:26:58 Oh.
01:26:58 And we shoveled this, Tom?
01:27:01 Whole Foods.
01:27:02 I see.
01:27:02 Trying to make things better.
01:27:04 Like what if we had some fucking unhealthy things here so that people would actually power shit?
01:27:08 Because I worked, I worked up, I didn't work on the floor.
01:27:10 There was like an upstairs where they made all the signage and stuff.
01:27:12 Because all the signs of Whole Foods are done by hand.
01:27:16 So I'd have to like write, I had to like do a bunch of classes to learn how to do the Whole Foods
01:27:20 handwritten font.
01:27:21 There's like classes you had to take on how to do that.
01:27:23 So I'd learn how to do that.
01:27:24 And then like you just write these big signs and you have to like draw and cut out on like
01:27:27 phone board and stuff like illustrations to like...
01:27:30 They must be losing so much money by using that system.
01:27:33 Absolutely.
01:27:34 To train people to make a handwriting font.
01:27:36 It's their goddamn branding though.
01:27:37 They gots to do it.
01:27:38 I love that they have this corporate fucking pipeline to artificially induce that homemade aesthetic.
01:27:45 It's so fucking fake.
01:27:46 Like do they like, hey we need to go and pick out the individual coffee beans,
01:27:50 but first we need to put you in baggy shitty like overalls and then like make you look ethnic?
01:27:55 Probably.
01:27:57 Yeah, so that was dumb.
01:27:59 But I was like, I was trying to like...
01:28:01 We had these two computers to do all the work on.
01:28:04 And one of them was like a really really old Power Mac G5 and it was a piece of shit.
01:28:08 And they had files on both computers.
01:28:11 So if you were...
01:28:12 There were three people in the office including me.
01:28:14 They would be on the computers.
01:28:15 I'd be doing all the bitch work because I was the newest person.
01:28:17 And if they needed to get a file off the other computer, they have to stop what they're doing,
01:28:21 get off, go on the other computer, get the file and bring it over.
01:28:24 And I was like, I can network these.
01:28:26 Like give me some time and I can network them together.
01:28:28 So you can access the files from each other's system so you don't have to keep stopping.
01:28:32 And they like, give me like an hour to do it.
01:28:35 I'm like, it's gonna take more than this.
01:28:36 And they're like, well forget it, you suck.
01:28:37 We hate you.
01:28:37 And there's like just tons of like little things about how like the signs were made.
01:28:41 They're like, we could do this faster, but they like refuse and eventually they're just like get out.
01:28:45 So that's how I lost that job.
01:28:47 Okay.
01:28:48 Okay.
01:28:48 And then I started doing Patreon for a while.
01:28:50 Never try and fix the world ever, is the moral.
01:28:53 That was the moral of the story.
01:28:54 Never give up.
01:28:55 Sometimes corporate systems can be too rigid and we clash with them.
01:29:00 It's true, but never give up on fixing the world even if some people.
01:29:03 If embargo and boycott whole foods, that is the moral of this message.
01:29:07 And then the last job I had, I had a job for, I think a week doing at a racquetball office,
01:29:15 doing like paperwork for them.
01:29:16 And it was like the most dumb job in the world because I originally,
01:29:21 one of my mom's friends told me about it because she works like a hiring agency
01:29:25 who's trying to get people to fill the slot and I need a job.
01:29:27 She's like, do this.
01:29:28 It's work from home.
01:29:29 It's like $15 an hour and you'll be doing like social media stuff,
01:29:33 like getting your social media brand account set up.
01:29:35 And I was like, oh yeah, I can do that in my sleep.
01:29:37 Sure.
01:29:38 So I like go through all these like ridiculous bullshit,
01:29:41 like trying to talk to people to get the job signed up.
01:29:43 And during that time, it changed from work from home to come into our office an hour away
01:29:49 and from $15 to $10.
01:29:51 So, and I was just like, I was already signed the paperwork at that point,
01:29:55 but day before I went into work, they're like, by the way,
01:29:57 you were only giving you a two thirds of what we said that the price was going to be.
01:30:01 So I'd go in there and I just like, it's not social media branding anymore.
01:30:05 They just want me to like do data entry.
01:30:07 So the entire job was a lie.
01:30:09 And I was like, okay, so I was there for a week and then a week,
01:30:12 the next week, I got an email when I woke up before I was going to go into work saying,
01:30:17 we actually decided we don't want anyone to have this position because it's too expensive.
01:30:21 So you're fired.
01:30:24 And it was, you know what, your stories about all this,
01:30:30 everyone just seems to fuck you over all the time.
01:30:31 And it reminds me of the opposite.
01:30:33 Are you starting to understand why my life is awful?
01:30:36 No, let's, and like next PCP episode, the PCP fucks over Tom.
01:30:41 Then we kick him out and we take his money.
01:30:44 I just remembered the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
01:30:47 And it was when I got fired.
01:30:49 Well, I didn't get fired.
01:30:50 They just like stopped the hire, they just stopped paying me from that job where I was
01:30:55 like doing document editing for whatever company.
01:30:59 I did not know, I had no idea that this is how it worked,
01:31:02 but you know, I did that job for maybe six months.
01:31:05 This was like kind of during the TBAP days or maybe a little before.
01:31:10 So it turned out afterwards that I didn't know about unemployment insurance,
01:31:16 but apparently if you work like a real job or a real enough job,
01:31:20 you know, they just bank a bunch of money with the government.
01:31:24 And then if you lose the job under like the right circumstances,
01:31:27 like if they lay you off or whatever, whatever, you just get more money,
01:31:34 like even though you're not working.
01:31:35 And so like for like several months or maybe like two months or more after that,
01:31:40 I was getting like $200 a week in the mail.
01:31:44 And I was like, or no, it was like $150 a week.
01:31:47 And I was like, oh my God, it's, this is all like,
01:31:49 like I was living in a shitty little side room of some guys apartment.
01:31:52 I was like, I can basically live off this.
01:31:54 Like I don't, I'm not working, but I can live and it's like America.
01:31:59 And you know, that's that, that's that emotion, you know, that,
01:32:02 and then I hatched a plan to live that way for the rest of my life.
01:32:05 Right. Yeah.
01:32:06 So it was this unfortunate series of events that led to your current mindset
01:32:09 about lowering your standards to adjust to whatever,
01:32:12 whatever you're currently being given out of the, out of the pity of people's hearts.
01:32:16 It's funny, it's funny you mentioned that.
01:32:17 That's the origin story.
01:32:19 Like this job, the racket ball job was actually like amazing because like,
01:32:23 what a racket am I right?
01:32:24 It was, it was, it was incredible.
01:32:26 Like I made negative money working for this job because,
01:32:30 because of the driving or something.
01:32:31 Because, because they, I had initially gone there to get a work from home
01:32:36 because I didn't, my car was broken and I didn't have the money to fix it.
01:32:40 So, so I got the job because there was supposed to be a work at home position.
01:32:44 So then they said, well, it's actually a driving in position.
01:32:47 So I had to get my car fixed, which was $600.
01:32:50 And then I only got $150 where I was fired.
01:32:52 So I made negative $450 working for this.
01:32:57 Which was amazing.
01:32:59 First of all, Nate, I can understand why you're so fucking utilitarian and
01:33:03 objectivist sometimes when like, I hear people all the time go,
01:33:07 Oh, it's a full stereotype that there's all these people who just wouldn't work at all
01:33:10 if they didn't have to.
01:33:11 But like your older brother kind of is like that.
01:33:13 So I guess Ben did it, everyone.
01:33:15 It's Ben mentality.
01:33:17 I did it.
01:33:19 You just like, you're one of these guys who doesn't want to have to work any harder.
01:33:22 And if someone just gave you money, of course you'd take it, you know.
01:33:24 Well, why not?
01:33:24 Who wouldn't?
01:33:26 Because you're not, I'll tell you why Ben.
01:33:28 And it's because you will not have real power over your life.
01:33:32 You'll always be dependent on people.
01:33:33 And that's not fun.
01:33:34 That's very stressful.
01:33:34 Listen, the only thing that I want power for is to be able to do whatever I want.
01:33:40 But what if they take it away one day?
01:33:42 And if I have that, if I can have that, you know, without, you know, working for it,
01:33:47 like, like if I can have that on like relatively little, you know, resources,
01:33:53 then it like, what would more resources even gain me?
01:33:56 Really, the only thing that the greater number of resources gain you,
01:33:58 which I would understand if people didn't put as a priority,
01:34:00 but it's just a bigger safety net if things go wrong or change.
01:34:05 That's really what it comes down to.
01:34:06 I like a big safety net.
01:34:07 I do.
01:34:08 I admit it.
01:34:08 Sure, sure.
01:34:09 That's all.
01:34:10 It's just if I'm all, if I'm managing to do everything that I want with relatively little,
01:34:15 you know, it's not, I don't have much motivation to strive for more.
01:34:20 I have big goals for my life.
01:34:22 Because I already, because in that situation, I've already achieved the goal.
01:34:26 I, it is, it has come to my attention.
01:34:27 But a safety net is true.
01:34:28 And you know, I mean, it's not like I, you know,
01:34:33 I put off a lot of responsibilities for a lot of time and like,
01:34:36 I put off paying off my student loans for a long time and that was irresponsible.
01:34:39 So.
01:34:39 Sure, sure.
01:34:41 I'm not, that was not the optimal solution.
01:34:45 Well, there you go.
01:34:45 That's great.
01:34:46 I'm glad to hear that.
01:34:48 I guys, I know it's off topic, but I just need to say,
01:34:52 like that came into my life in real time.
01:34:54 This little bundle of joy that just appeared right now.
01:34:57 I need to share with you guys here today.
01:34:59 This will be in the show notes.
01:35:01 Oh, what's, what's this about?
01:35:02 Just, just, just look and see who you see in this crowd shot of this My Little Pony episode.
01:35:07 Just, just go through and tell me who you see.
01:35:10 I see the Breaking Bad guy.
01:35:12 I see Heisenberg.
01:35:13 It's Rick and Morty.
01:35:14 Yeah.
01:35:14 Wait, this isn't it.
01:35:15 Oh, there it is.
01:35:17 There they are.
01:35:17 This is not real.
01:35:19 Well, I mean, they've already done Dr. Hooves.
01:35:21 No, look at, look at, like, look at the pixels on Morty's eyebrow.
01:35:25 It's real.
01:35:26 How do we know this is real?
01:35:27 Where's the confirmation?
01:35:28 That looks, that looks fake to me.
01:35:30 I saw it posted somewhere.
01:35:32 Oh, is that Heisenberg?
01:35:32 And I choose to believe it.
01:35:33 Is that Heisenberg in the back?
01:35:35 I think so.
01:35:35 Probably.
01:35:36 Disgusting.
01:35:37 Okay, but hang on.
01:35:38 His cutie mark is a pickle.
01:35:40 Like would Rick's cutie mark really be?
01:35:41 No, no, it's a test.
01:35:42 It's not.
01:35:43 It's a test too.
01:35:43 Oh, oh, okay.
01:35:44 My screen is fucked up.
01:35:45 Yeah, yeah, I see it.
01:35:46 Okay.
01:35:46 The bottom looks like a pickle.
01:35:49 Okay.
01:35:49 All right.
01:35:50 Uh, I don't, I don't know.
01:35:51 I can't even speculate.
01:35:53 Right, dude.
01:35:53 Like Tom, whenever you talk about how people were just like,
01:35:57 Hey, we, you know, that job we decided to give you,
01:35:59 we decided to not give you that job.
01:36:01 It reminded me of the inverse of this one window cleaning customer I had,
01:36:05 which was like a fucking modern castle, but a house,
01:36:10 which is to say a really big house that has lots of stone,
01:36:12 like siding and shit.
01:36:14 And I was just like, damn, this house is amazing.
01:36:16 And my dad told me that he had talked with, you know,
01:36:18 the customers and like had a conversation and like
01:36:22 somewhere or another, how they made all this money came up.
01:36:25 Cause these people were fucking young, like mid thirties, maybe early, no, no.
01:36:28 I think like late twenties and with like, like some baby kids, right?
01:36:33 So here's what it was.
01:36:34 The guy, the husband, the dad, he's like a legal document writer thing or something.
01:36:43 He like was doing negotiations for a thing regarding a casino.
01:36:47 And basically his company had him write up a list of terms and agreements and
01:36:54 usually they're going to like reject half of it and you're going to be negotiating for a while.
01:36:59 But they just accepted all of their terms.
01:37:01 I don't know exactly the cause and effect chain reaction here,
01:37:04 but basically it just meant that they all made shit billion dollars of money.
01:37:08 Right.
01:37:09 And it's just like, wow.
01:37:10 Yeah.
01:37:10 That's like a total like out of nowhere windfall.
01:37:14 Crazy.
01:37:14 Right.
01:37:15 And like the mom was saying that like it's crazy when I'm taking my kids to the grocery store
01:37:20 and they basically want everything off the shelf.
01:37:23 And I don't know what to do because I could buy everything on the shelf.
01:37:26 Right.
01:37:28 I'm like, damn bro.
01:37:34 Damn.
01:37:35 Yeah.
01:37:36 It's just like, I feel damned when fucking how when like YouTubers are all like,
01:37:40 I can't believe it.
01:37:40 I have 500,000 subscribers.
01:37:43 I never thought I'd have that many.
01:37:45 Really?
01:37:46 You actually got more subscribers than you imagined yourself having.
01:37:49 Does anyone ever actually done that?
01:37:52 Or am I just, I don't know.
01:37:54 You know what I'm talking about guys?
01:37:56 Yeah.
01:37:57 Well, I suppose I'm lost.
01:38:00 Yeah.
01:38:00 I know.
01:38:02 I'm gay.
01:38:05 I haven't gone through my list.
01:38:06 I haven't gone through my list.
01:38:07 Yeah.
01:38:08 Please, please.
01:38:08 Yeah.
01:38:10 As I said before, I am post job.
01:38:14 The only jobs I have have been like a back room deals.
01:38:20 Like like no like official salary or you know,
01:38:24 you know, what's the word like regular earnings.
01:38:27 You know, I did not have like a schedule or anything.
01:38:30 I would just do odd jobs throughout society and mostly commissions on the internet.
01:38:36 So I am post.
01:38:39 What's that again?
01:38:39 It's called the gig economy, right?
01:38:41 Right.
01:38:42 Yeah, that's right.
01:38:42 That's right.
01:38:43 I am post job.
01:38:45 I have lived my entire life, including now where I guess you could say that the PCP is a job,
01:38:53 but like it's more fluid.
01:38:55 It's more fluid.
01:38:56 It's entirely like individual.
01:38:58 Like it's basically commission based more or less for everyone, including me.
01:39:03 Yeah.
01:39:03 So on the only jobs, like if I like the main thing that I've done with my life,
01:39:10 like the main salary earner, I would say is probably commissions followed by the PCP
01:39:15 in terms of how much I've made.
01:39:17 You're also a lawn mower, ain't you?
01:39:20 Well, I used to.
01:39:21 I don't really do that as much anymore, but that's what I'm saying.
01:39:22 I remember you saying that that's how you paid for your flight to Radcon too,
01:39:25 if I remember correctly.
01:39:27 Well, it was mostly commissions, but like.
01:39:29 Okay, no shade on it obviously.
01:39:31 I think it's cool.
01:39:32 No, no, no, no, no.
01:39:34 I know that it's cool.
01:39:37 That's why I say what I mean, like do odd jobs through society,
01:39:39 where I'll just like go a neighbor or someone who just needs me to do something for them.
01:39:44 Who just needs me to perform some miscellaneous sexual act?
01:39:47 I understood.
01:39:48 Yeah, exactly, exactly.
01:39:48 Yeah, okay.
01:39:49 I don't like to do that much anymore because I don't, like most of the people who would be
01:39:54 that are like not here and like I don't live in an area that pertains to,
01:40:00 what I'm saying is I live in a shit ghetto place and I'm not really in demand anymore.
01:40:07 So most of it is online stuff, but I've never like, I didn't have like a summer job or anything.
01:40:14 I've never had like, you know, I need to flip burgers in a high score or anything.
01:40:19 My flipping burgers was flipping minds and creating psychological revolutions on this podcast.
01:40:26 I mean, because you know, that's definitely true.
01:40:29 And it's like, I got my first job at Papa Geno's, or you know, it works for my neighbor,
01:40:33 whatever, like the first one I think it was Papa Geno's that I did when I was like 16 and a half
01:40:37 or like 17 or something.
01:40:38 Yeah, that's exactly, yeah.
01:40:39 And that's like, that's exactly like when you were doing like this stuff, this online stuff and
01:40:44 Mohan Lawson, you know, but more importantly, like the commission.
01:40:46 So like you totally, just like your generation in general, at least like the artists out there
01:40:52 now have like the ability to do this like online commission work when guys like, you know,
01:40:56 my generation was the transitional one where we were going toward this,
01:41:00 but everybody still got like shitty meme jobs out there.
01:41:02 I know, that's what I'm trying to hammer home.
01:41:04 We are folks job.
01:41:05 We have evolved past the need for jobs.
01:41:09 We can just do like, like, like, like, like young artists can just do commission work
01:41:13 and they can get fucking mad dash.
01:41:16 By mad dash, I mean barely more than like a quarter of what you need to live.
01:41:21 Well, you know, this is the fascinating thing though.
01:41:23 Like maybe I'm not really sure it's a quote unquote good thing for like the people
01:41:31 I guess just like for the worker class of society that things are going this way
01:41:35 because things used to be much more cushy and like comfortable and you didn't really need
01:41:39 to worry about it.
01:41:40 And like the economy has just gotten so much more demanding, I guess you have to have like
01:41:44 two parents working to support a family and stuff.
01:41:47 I'm not saying there's nothing to be done except rise to the challenge, obviously.
01:41:52 But I'm just saying that like people really seem to be like lowering their standards across
01:41:57 the board and maybe at a necessity.
01:41:58 Like I don't know if it's just, you know, not everyone's a Ben out here.
01:42:02 It's just, you know, like I was reading like something recently about how like,
01:42:06 or you know what it was?
01:42:07 It was that article that came out pretty recently about how like your average YouTuber
01:42:11 is like barely escaping poverty.
01:42:14 I mean, not your average YouTuber, like your successful mainstream YouTuber,
01:42:17 like I don't know, like your super bunny hops maybe or, you know, one of those tier of guys.
01:42:22 Like those guys like are barely making what like, you know, like a livable minimum class wage,
01:42:28 or minimum class, middle class wage.
01:42:32 And there's just like, like where's the growth opportunity here?
01:42:36 Like there is some if you become like a media mogul or something and you really like
01:42:40 take the internet by storm, you know, you're a fucking PewDiePie or you're, you know,
01:42:44 like the young Turks have a huge network of stuff.
01:42:46 But like, man, it's tough out there in the commission world of being an artiste on the internet.
01:42:51 It is tough out there.
01:42:52 But I think what you lose in like wealth and money, you make up for in time doing what you like.
01:43:02 That's valuable.
01:43:03 Which is the most valuable thing.
01:43:05 That is the highest good that there is.
01:43:07 Agreed.
01:43:08 I'm sort of on board because like, what do you want to do with the money?
01:43:12 Do things that you want to do.
01:43:14 Yeah, that's right.
01:43:15 If you're doing what you want to do, then I said this time and time again,
01:43:19 where I don't particularly want to be super rich or anything.
01:43:22 I just want to be able to do what I want to do, which is just to draw forever.
01:43:27 And so as long as I'm not dead and I'm drawing forever, that's ideal for me.
01:43:31 Yeah, Munchie, what you're tapping into is the fact that we're in this transitionary period,
01:43:35 like hypothetically, well, it won't be that long before robots actually do actually everything.
01:43:41 Like they could even make novels better than people could.
01:43:44 And at that point, we're just crossing our fingers that we continue to be the masters
01:43:48 of this planetary domain.
01:43:50 That will be the final issue.
01:43:52 But at that point, you know, we won't even have money.
01:43:55 I mean, I don't know, this is this is really high minded shit.
01:43:58 But like, we're sort of moving into an area where like,
01:44:01 if everything is automated, hypothetically, then you don't even need to pay money for
01:44:05 anything because everything is automated, right?
01:44:07 So we're sort of hypothetically transitioning away from a life from a world where money is
01:44:13 even relevant.
01:44:14 And the transitionary side effects is it feels like we're fucking up and failing
01:44:19 because we're making less money.
01:44:21 But like money is becoming less relevant.
01:44:24 You know, like, think about, yeah, that's kind of the awkward transitional,
01:44:28 if we're talking like the baby boomer era, we're talking about like the 60s and 70s,
01:44:31 we're thinking about like, it's all about making lots of money and spending that money
01:44:34 to have a good life.
01:44:36 But nowadays, you can sort of have a lot of the same things for a lot less money.
01:44:40 How much money did you have to spend back in the 70s to have a level of entertainment that
01:44:45 you can now have with Netflix?
01:44:47 You know?
01:44:48 Yeah, infinitely more, obviously.
01:44:50 So like, I feel like we've sort of developed our lives.
01:44:55 Like the capitalism develops in our minds, this idea of like this fucking MMO that we're all
01:45:01 playing where like the score that you judge yourself by is your point, which is to say
01:45:06 your money, right?
01:45:07 But there are other ways to feel valuable.
01:45:10 And yeah, I think that like your KD ratio or something, right?
01:45:14 So yeah, yeah, let's we need to gamify real life.
01:45:21 The only problem is I don't trust anyone to make a system where like you allocate points
01:45:25 for the right things, because you're just going to get a bunch of like spawn camping
01:45:28 pieces of shit who just, you know, that's endless war.
01:45:31 Endless war is the gamification of real life.
01:45:33 Yeah, you're right.
01:45:34 The only thing is to make endless war real, aka incite gang violence across all the major
01:45:39 cities in the United States of America.
01:45:41 And then we'll have our ideal society.
01:45:43 We have to irradiate the seas and turn it all to slime.
01:45:46 We need to flood the Grand Canyon with slime to make that slime river flow.
01:45:52 Yes.
01:45:54 And the violence should follow naturally from there.
01:45:57 That's true, but also forbidden.
01:46:00 Deleted.
01:46:01 I I I've been having doubts myself about about how the upward momentum of Internet
01:46:14 content creation and how it will be good for like like me personally.
01:46:20 And I've been thinking about, you know, like I really admire and I and I respect the security
01:46:25 that you have, Nate, of, you know, just doing a job, having that safety net and also doing
01:46:31 what you love, you know, make videos and stuff.
01:46:35 And I have not fully formulated and you'll hard set my opinion.
01:46:39 I used to be super into like, you know, obviously content creation is just a way for me in lines
01:46:44 with all of my beliefs and like what I want to do and it will allow me to do what I want.
01:46:47 But the more I think about the more I think, well, you know, like, like having more money
01:46:52 will be having more money and I will be able to do more of what I want.
01:46:57 You know what I'm saying?
01:46:58 If I, yeah, yeah, wealthy, I will be able to go and go more places and do more things,
01:47:02 which will tie back into my heart.
01:47:04 Yeah, I mean, it does serve the goal of, you know, freedom.
01:47:10 Yeah, it gives you the freedom.
01:47:11 You just it is important to balance your your time that you dedicate to this thing to give
01:47:16 you the safety net so you can do the fun things that you really are passionate about versus
01:47:23 you know, about those two things, making sure that they don't, one doesn't consume the other.
01:47:27 And, you know, like you have to be pragmatic.
01:47:29 Like if you can't pay your rent unless you spend, you know, 12 hours a day at a normie job,
01:47:35 you know, because then you have to do that or else you'll just die and then you won't get to
01:47:39 spend any time doing the fun stuff.
01:47:41 So, you know, you got to be pragmatic about the stuff.
01:47:43 But yeah, that's that's the most important thing I'd want people to take away.
01:47:46 I think that's really important.
01:47:47 If you can make it work full time doing the thing you want to do.
01:47:50 Fantastic. I recommend you do so immediately.
01:47:52 But, you know, being aware of where future trends are going.
01:47:56 And I mean, these days there's a lot of there's a lot of cracking down on some of the more out there.
01:48:02 The only future trend that matters is your trend into the fucking grave.
01:48:06 So there's no time.
01:48:07 There's no time.
01:48:08 Which is 100%.
01:48:10 There's no time to be like, oh, I wonder if I should like wait or not.
01:48:14 No, just fucking do your shit because time's the most important thing.
01:48:18 Money's stupid.
01:48:20 Just fucking waiting waiting in general is almost always a mistake.
01:48:24 But it's important to take smart action.
01:48:26 So like it just like like there's this guy like Uncle Adams.
01:48:29 I know I think I talked about it before, but that guy just said like fuck it.
01:48:31 I'm going to spend whatever amount of money it takes work full time on being a musician.
01:48:36 And I will drive myself into the fucking ground until I get there.
01:48:39 Like in my personal opinion, he is a little bit naive about his chances.
01:48:43 And I think a much smarter move would be to like get a job work on your music in the side.
01:48:48 And because frankly, his music is like, isn't that great?
01:48:50 It's like, what if you never get good and you never get the money back?
01:48:53 Like which will happen to most people who try probably, you know, worrisome.
01:48:57 So you have a motivational crack.com article talking about success.
01:49:03 And like it's point number six to be successful or to get anywhere in life.
01:49:08 You have to start now, which is pretty basic sentiment.
01:49:11 But my favorite my favorite sentence on probably anything cracks ever written
01:49:15 was I would come home every day, I would be at work all day not liking my job,
01:49:20 thinking about all the things I'd like to do writing my novels and shit.
01:49:24 But then I'd get home and then file the rest of my time under the fuck this day folder.
01:49:30 And then just get ready to do it all again tomorrow.
01:49:34 That's what people do.
01:49:35 That's what people do.
01:49:37 It's really easy to do that.
01:49:38 I did that for a long time myself.
01:49:39 I always I did that my a lot of my life and hated myself intensely for it.
01:49:44 And I was just so delighted to look back one day after I'd gone through doing all this Tbap
01:49:49 and you know best guy ever in PCP stuff.
01:49:51 And now I'm just like I'm so happy every day when I realize I'm not that guy anymore.
01:49:56 I'm like still that 50% of the time it's like a coin toss whether I'll actually like burn a day or not.
01:50:02 And it's okay be wrong.
01:50:04 Yesterday I should have been working on finishing all the paperwork for like who gets what for the
01:50:10 for the rad kind of it.
01:50:11 Instead I played Stardew Valley.
01:50:13 So you know every day you have a lot of money writing on that.
01:50:18 So I feel free to criticize me everybody.
01:50:21 That's totally fair.
01:50:22 But I'm working on it.
01:50:22 I'm by the time you hear this it'll be done.
01:50:24 So I will say like I have figured out I have cured myself of the most base form of procrastination.
01:50:33 But there's other forms like a crop.
01:50:34 He has to leave the podcast now.
01:50:37 Well I'm supposed to be working on the next Digi video right now.
01:50:41 And I'm kind of doing it.
01:50:42 But I was also kind of just working on selecting dozens of different colors for mannequins in a
01:50:48 level in a video game.
01:50:49 And I'm like I don't want to make the video.
01:50:51 I want to make more colors for my mannequins.
01:50:54 So I'm like oh um anyway the point is.
01:50:57 D-d-divu.
01:50:58 What's up?
01:50:58 Oh continue continue I'll do it after you.
01:51:00 Yeah so I tend to procrastinate by doing something else.
01:51:03 But isn't the thing I'm supposed to do.
01:51:04 A lot of people do that as a way to trick themselves into thinking they're doing what
01:51:07 they should be doing.
01:51:08 Like for example when it's time to do your taxes I will like clean my room.
01:51:12 Because one is like less objectionable than the other.
01:51:15 You know we do that kind of stuff.
01:51:16 Don't fall for that trap people.
01:51:17 You got to be aware of that stuff.
01:51:19 You got to be aware.
01:51:21 So like here's the thing about all these motivational speeches that you've been cutting Nate.
01:51:25 It's like I give all these I mean you're better you're a better hype man than me.
01:51:29 So I guess this is the difference.
01:51:30 But all these people in my life who I've known.
01:51:32 Who have who still struggle with the same problems I had before I started working hard.
01:51:38 And I just feel like none of my motivational fucking speeches like help them at all.
01:51:42 Like for me I look back at myself and it was just all it took was I had I was forced to
01:51:46 start doing a full-time job.
01:51:49 And then like nine months later it was literally just something in me snapped.
01:51:55 And I just didn't stop working ever.
01:51:58 And I don't know maybe it's just not everyone is cut out for this.
01:52:03 Maybe some people ultimately don't mind having a stupid job that much.
01:52:08 They just think that all these cool internet people are cool.
01:52:11 So I want to be like that.
01:52:12 It's like you know I think it might only be for you if not being that is literal psychological torture.
01:52:21 You know as the world famous show Grounded for Life once eloquently put it somebody's
01:52:26 got to make the sandwiches.
01:52:27 Yes.
01:52:28 And that's a perfectly reasonable thing to say.
01:52:30 When the robots make the sandwiches there is a there is an AI burger flipper.
01:52:34 I don't really put a lot of stock personally in like willpower or like people's like inner
01:52:40 strength coming out.
01:52:41 I really think you're just either predisposed to hear a certain message and then like do stuff
01:52:45 or you won't be.
01:52:47 So yeah you know I just think like some people will just get that.
01:52:51 But what I will say is though like because I am a guy who cares about this kind of stuff.
01:52:56 I think that the more messages that are out there though the higher likelihood that someone
01:53:01 might hear it and then be inspired to do these sorts of things which I would argue is a good
01:53:05 thing.
01:53:06 Motivational speeches didn't work on me but it might work on someone else.
01:53:10 Yeah exactly exactly.
01:53:12 I okay this is slightly off topic but I but there needs to be a topic about self-help
01:53:18 culture slash like spirituality because my mom my mom is so hopped up on like feeling the
01:53:26 good vibrations and like thought it was within you and like self-help and like trying to
01:53:31 like like like like do all these like weird like bell and whistles like like fucking fake
01:53:36 snake oil bullshit in order to make herself feel better after coming home from work instead
01:53:41 of just trying like to do normal like I'm going to take a walk or exercise.
01:53:47 See that stuff that stuff comes off.
01:53:50 That stuff comes off is so like I don't know like not not like you're talking down to people
01:53:56 and like it's just so like self masturbatory and like not actually fixing the problem.
01:54:02 That's why I always do and I always go for like the blackpilled like self-help like listen
01:54:08 literally no one cares about your life.
01:54:10 You are worthless in the eyes of everyone else only you can like fix your shit.
01:54:15 So listen do you want to show your life do you want to be sad forever you know if that's
01:54:19 the situation you're in if the answer is no literally no one else will help you you have
01:54:25 to do it yourself.
01:54:26 That's the kind of message that I respond to at least and so it seems more sincere.
01:54:30 Whenever I fucking get in my mom's car and we go anywhere she always is playing some
01:54:39 fucking bullshit like someone lying through their fucking teeth making mad dosh praying
01:54:46 on fucking naive like like like like like mentally exhausted middle-aged single moms
01:54:52 sure it was like he like like self-help like how to be happy in 10 steps here's what you do
01:54:58 or like a thousand steps and it's all fucking not like it's all like like nebulous fucking
01:55:04 not actually like practical like not actually like just take these steps it's all fucking
01:55:09 bullshit number one remember to love yourself oh my god that's it right that's the shit what
01:55:15 this is and when you have to self-help it's not like you shouldn't do that no of course not
01:55:20 of course not I know I can quantify the issue with this mentality that all these that so many
01:55:25 people have that it's a focus on the methods and not a focus on the results you see the
01:55:32 thing about all those books first helping you with any walk in life whether it be money or
01:55:37 confidence or sex they they spend so much time complicating the procedures and like adding more
01:55:45 and more things to remember and you just spend more and more time thinking about all the improvements
01:55:50 you can do then it distracts you from the fact that it's actually it's pretty easy to know whether
01:55:55 or not things are changing you just look and see the results you know yeah like you just gotta be
01:56:00 honest about your situation books to like get you laid with women you know that I feel like they
01:56:06 kind of distract you from a very simple a very simple test are you getting laid or not right
01:56:13 all you got to do is just keep examining that fact and then change your behavior accordingly
01:56:19 you know a great way I look at great example of this I think is like like working out and
01:56:24 like being in the gym the work is the ultimate example of that like you could read it is it
01:56:28 is perfect for this because if you aren't tracking your numbers and your reps and your like if you
01:56:34 you're smart you should measure like your waist size if you're trying to lose weight and you know
01:56:37 check your weight like you should be writing it all down if you're not you're fucking up right
01:56:41 off the gate but most people I think do who are serious about this by doing that you have
01:56:45 uncontroversial like 100 factual results right in front of you every time you go in so you know
01:56:52 if you're doing it right and if you're not progressing you are doing something wrong and it's just
01:56:58 up to you if you're gonna fix or not or if you just don't care I know I've seen like fitness videos
01:57:02 about this being like you can spend forever researching fitness and never like dipping your
01:57:08 fucking toes into it get yourself addicted to the feeling of actually having accomplished something
01:57:15 you know that's the way that's the way exercise is good for you and will make you feel good go
01:57:20 back yeah like watch water advice watch water it just takes effort it takes more effort than
01:57:26 not doing it so the default is to not do it of course for I just realized a way I can describe
01:57:34 what's happening here these these books want to say that it's all mental like it's all in your head
01:57:41 the reason why why your life sucks and you're and you feel bad because you don't do anything it's
01:57:46 all mental it's not about your physical habits that you do it's not about what you do with your life
01:57:51 and like who you hang out with or the way that you spend your time it's all just like just like
01:57:56 readjust how like it's like just think about you know when you put in your debit card to pay for
01:58:02 something and it makes the no it's just thinking about like an 8-bit video game just making like an
01:58:07 8-bit video game yeah I can see that seems like that mentality is a little bit liberating but
01:58:14 really it's binding it's basically putting all misfortune onto you like it's all within you
01:58:19 nothing about your environment is limiting you see that's where like like someone might be tempted
01:58:25 to like really gravitate to that because it allows them to like quote-unquote like be responsible
01:58:29 for everything but that's not actually the case it makes your challenge insurmountable in some
01:58:35 cases yeah well it just it's just you're not fully assessing the problem because like just for example
01:58:41 if you want to lose weight and like your whole family is fat and all your friends are fat like
01:58:47 like yes you could theoretically just completely change your habits but realistically we have
01:58:51 to recognize we are weak impressionable foolish creatures and the best thing to do is start hanging
01:58:57 around people who eat the way you want to eat and who exercise and to get friends like that you know
01:59:02 that's the that's that's a huge way to change our environment yeah yeah yeah I'm just saying and
01:59:08 I'll just share my mom because she's a great lady and I like her but like she'll listen to all of
01:59:12 these books and and she's listening to like like unbelievable like hundreds of books and hasn't
01:59:18 given her a single extra number in her kd ratio has increased at all exactly exactly because
01:59:25 she'll just do like like she'll just try and like think about the world differently but she doesn't
01:59:30 do anything differently she still does the exact same things that she's always done for years this
01:59:36 much his mom is the ultimate nemesis of the pcp she is our art ethicist of
01:59:43 if Nate were to encounter her as like a child he would have smothered her like
01:59:49 well listen I got a lot of respect for for people who raise a kid but but you know still we can still
01:59:53 make criticism it is totally back easy to fall into the trap of like listening to and like indulging
01:59:59 in things that like tell you that like tell you how to feel better that like that like that like
02:00:05 tell you how to think you know yeah yeah like like like it's easy to fall down the self-help
02:00:10 rabbit hole and and think and think that it is doing something for you even listening to this
02:00:16 podcast fair viewer you may be pushing off responsibilities maybe you should be applying
02:00:21 for that job you want right now instead of listening to this podcast about jobs for a bunch of assholes
02:00:28 who don't know shit like one quote from welcome to the nhk that did you always fucking quotes where
02:00:33 the guy says I have read all the self-help books I could write a self-help book just based on my
02:00:41 knowledge of all the other self-help books and none of it has helped me yeah but like to jump back
02:00:48 to what you said about um about uh you know getting yourself into an environment of say
02:00:52 people who eat right or eat the way you want to eat I guess one thing to keep in mind
02:00:58 is that we here on youtube telling people about getting success on youtube we exist in this void
02:01:03 without considering any of the other values and variables or things that you want to have or
02:01:07 maintain in your life i.e if the people if all the fat fucks if all the fucking grease slurping
02:01:14 slobs in your life are people who matter to you maybe that's simply your fate if you can't turn
02:01:20 your if you can't turn your fucking there's no such thing as fate fucking bean burger
02:01:25 knows away from them then maybe not your fate but ultimately maybe you should give up you should
02:01:31 give up the bacon of giving up bacon right well it's it's just you're making a calculation that
02:01:36 you know your proximity to these people is more important to you than whatever the goal is and
02:01:40 you can do that a lot of people do that it's actually pretty psychologically easy for me
02:01:45 in like 2012 to decide I should start working on youtube or game design stuff because I had
02:01:52 nothing else going on in my life right I had like two friends who I would see once a week
02:02:00 and that's all I had to live for I had nothing to lose right whereas so you were liberated in a way
02:02:10 if you're someone who has anything to lose it becomes a much more difficult like my first
02:02:14 experience with actually having to make a hard decision was deciding how much effort I should
02:02:21 put into my channel versus the digi bro channel that was the first time I ever had an actual fucking
02:02:27 trade-off so just keep that in mind folks that a lot of people are held back like you might be held
02:02:33 back by other things you already have in your life you know and don't let our single-minded
02:02:41 explanations of how to fucking get youtube success like dictate your decisions because you have my
02:02:48 approach here I want people to insert whatever thing it is that they care about into the slot
02:02:55 of like just for example like if you want to lose weight or something surround yourself with
02:02:58 like-minded people you know whatever it is you're interested in whether you have passion for pursue
02:03:03 it with as much gusto as you can muster right like if doing yeah if doing an actual job like
02:03:10 being a dentist or some shit interests you like genuinely interests you and like doing painting
02:03:17 or some art thing doesn't interest you to a significant degree stronger I don't think there's
02:03:23 any reason to do that like the only reason I do art is because there's nothing else I am interested
02:03:29 in doing so it's actually a very easy decision for me sure yeah what are you gonna do when digi
02:03:37 bleeds all of his money for making an avant-garde content that no one understands or what are you
02:03:41 gonna do when he bleeds all this money fair fair question yeah I mean I'm right now I'm working
02:03:47 on going down and downloading shitloads of porn that's related to the video and gonna have to figure
02:03:52 out how to censor that yeah what are you gonna do when he bleeds away all of his money well I don't
02:03:59 know make uh he fucking he's gonna get a job there we go back on top there we go bringing it back
02:04:07 no I'm working I'm working on video games something even more okay quick question quick
02:04:12 question to do here's a real okay how much money have you invested in making this game and how much
02:04:16 have you seen on returns uh maybe both are maybe both are zero maybe I am well I am well
02:04:23 beyond well I mean that's my point it's you know what I think it's so bullshit to everyone now you
02:04:28 guys are jumping on this whole like oh you're in a patreon that someone else's patreon is y'all are
02:04:34 all living your life no no no I'm just asking dude I'm not giving you shit no
02:04:40 the fact that you were doing this for digi is not a problem at all the fact is that digi is
02:04:44 bleeding money and exactly as I would say for anyone who works for a corporation like you should
02:04:49 be aware of if that corporation is like currently going through bankruptcy proceedings just like
02:04:54 my friend digi but no I'm just kidding that's not the sound but like theoretically let's just say digi
02:04:58 dies I mean you never know like just what if he dies you know and I'm just saying anyone in any
02:05:03 situation should be aware of the realities of how things could change and have a backup plan that's
02:05:07 on the right the reality I want to live in is where where where divu becomes unshackled exclamation
02:05:13 point divu well I will say I will say I deeply I deeply miss divu's videos I would love those
02:05:20 back yeah I forgot that would be that I forgot divu used to make video in a perfect world in a
02:05:24 perfect world uh but you know hey man okay digi's patreon did decrease over the winter
02:05:31 by a huge margin I've actually continued to get paid the same amount of money like digi also
02:05:37 makes lots of money from agrev that he just keeps sure I've actually been continued to be paid the
02:05:42 same amount of money so I'm not actually I don't want to criticize you you don't need to get into
02:05:46 if you don't want to I'm not trying to like examine your financial situation uh you know
02:05:50 if you don't want to that's perfectly perfectly fine but a bunch of started this munchie what the
02:05:55 hell do you need my money I mean that is actually why I'm on the pcp right now I decided yeah I'm
02:06:00 just gonna sure it's gonna fucking bite the bullet and be on this show where we go completely
02:06:03 off topic and I'm as bad as anyone else at that because I will make a bit of money I do need that
02:06:08 money uh so there you go good I didn't know where your priorities are the barrels was to your head
02:06:13 you just had to pull that trigger and he's done it last thank god like talking about what we said
02:06:18 earlier about the irrelevance of money in the face of like just being happy actually I basically
02:06:24 already have that like I felt like I fucking broke through the heavens of actually becoming
02:06:30 someone who makes stuff that people find relevant and useful to them that's really hard to accomplish
02:06:37 you know to like actually be someone who can make things that people give a shit that's really
02:06:42 hard to do so once I accomplish that I basically felt like I've been set for life you know now
02:06:47 that we found the goldmine that is water park vlogs there's no going back we've cracked we've
02:06:52 opened Pandora's box this is a bubble that will never burst
02:07:02 there's two there's two major forms of currency in 2018 and going forward there is two major
02:07:06 source of income across the world water park vlogs and endless war these are the two driving
02:07:11 force of the economy everything depends on them what if there is gang violence at Disneyland
02:07:17 oh christ it'll be a slime park instead of a water park oh my god that would be we have to make
02:07:23 that we have to we have to build yeah we have to build a new room we have to build a new room in
02:07:27 endless war the slime park oh maybe you can maybe you can pay you can like pay a little bit of
02:07:34 slime to like go on one of the rides or something you have to pay for admission yeah yeah okay okay
02:07:40 bin no okay okay you do like like like exclamation point ride name of ride and and then like like
02:07:47 and then you and then you pay amount of slime and then we have like six or seven like like like uh uh
02:07:54 text walls that we will type out describing your experience with the ride oh oh and here's a quick
02:08:00 thought yeah both both ben and munchy can make competing rides at the slime water park and of
02:08:05 course whoever makes the better ride will get the more money because they get paid for the experience
02:08:09 oh my god like right like we're like tycoons like we like this business we're like your rollers coaster
02:08:14 tycoons in real life and it'll be a race to see who can make more rides and like who can make more
02:08:21 like designs for rides like more like running like running this water park racket in the background
02:08:27 we're just like making slime hand over fists you know how there's like like like like in normal
02:08:32 means there's always like okay who can make the biggest roller coaster we can like who has like
02:08:35 the biggest wall effects describing this person's yeah exactly all right and this war has infinite
02:08:43 growth potential there we go straight from the mines to the water parks to the tycoons yeah we gotta
02:08:49 close this pcp because we have to work on endless war right the fuck we gotta get to the questions
02:08:54 these are the questions let's let's shift over to anyone want to make any final points on jobs
02:08:58 jobs suck i hate them that's fair correct same i am post jobs me and my me and my fellow
02:09:06 2000 millennial children are all post job hashtag post job you indigo children yeah we have no need
02:09:16 for for your for your dirt all you know why hashtag post your jobs because we're poor because the
02:09:22 robots have taken over jobs because um you know the other thing that's appetizing about this kind
02:09:30 of job is that you're your own boss you know you don't have to call in all the time but but just
02:09:35 remember people who want to have a job with their their own boss you really do you have to be your
02:09:40 own boss and you might end up hating yourself as your own boss and that's me i can talk about this
02:09:47 you know how like you get you blame your boss for making you go to work even though going to work is
02:09:51 like like what you're supposed to do with a job if you force yourself to do your job you might have
02:09:57 people blaming you for working like it can't it might even be you you might have contempt for
02:10:04 yourself for forcing yourself to work and if you can't have that then you probably cannot be your
02:10:10 own boss makes sense to me i mean dude it's fucking it's fucking hard like every every success you
02:10:18 get to revel in but every failure you have to realize it was totally your fault you know
02:10:23 so like it sucks realizing that oh i only make 10 percent of the money i used to
02:10:30 and that's my fault so hooray yeah uh well there you go all right let's let's get some questions
02:10:37 jobs are gay question time uh here we go here we go here is a pity question over on the twitter
02:10:46 hashtag sbcp follow us at tbcrasnators uh here here we go uh eskimo bob two asks do any of you
02:10:54 give to charities why are why not no anybody does any no because i'm a charity at this point
02:11:02 i don't give to charities simply because i don't have the money to i don't think i don't think
02:11:07 charities are like evil or anything i get the impression that people are in the chat are gonna
02:11:11 be like come down like oh fucking any don't you all know that charities are evil well well i don't
02:11:17 i don't really i'm sure nate's gonna throw some weird utilitarianism but no i would donate to charity
02:11:21 if i had the money to do so as long as i believe in the cause yeah i i don't have enough money that's
02:11:27 an excuse like if you did have the money you would is what munchie and tom are saying i don't really
02:11:31 trust charities but it's it's not even in the equate it's it's not even a question because i'm
02:11:37 you know because like i'm in debt and stuff i'm like i can't be i can't be doing that with like
02:11:41 that's not what i'm gonna do with money if i get it if it's a hard yes i would get a charity but i
02:11:47 don't it's it's not off the table for me in any way i was a charity that i trusted then maybe i
02:11:53 i i could make excuses personally all day about like oh my finances aren't in as good a shape as i
02:11:58 would like before being to me to start giving money but i'll tell you right now philosophically i
02:12:03 dislike charities not across the board but like the idea that i could give money to a charity and
02:12:10 like any of that money gets absorbed in like administrative costs i do and who knows who
02:12:15 knows what percentage that is i okay i get exactly that has to be there has to be some mechanism like
02:12:21 there has to be some red tape there for like anything to get done like okay i know again like
02:12:26 i'm a little biased here but like i think about like the fucking the pink ribbons the nfl players
02:12:30 who are like the pink shoes are like the it's like breast cancer awareness and like of course we
02:12:34 all want to fight breast cancer it's evil let's kill it but the if you look into the finances like
02:12:40 less than like 10 percent of the revenue from that shit goes to the goddamn charity and fucking
02:12:45 nike keeps the rest and the fucking nfl gets their cut of course like it sickens me i think of
02:12:51 charities as sort of like a modern day what was it like catholic church uh where you just give the
02:12:56 catholic church money in order to get into heaven for free i think of charities and basically like
02:13:00 well even if the money socially that's what they are even if the money didn't actually go to a good
02:13:05 cause i intended for it to be a good cause therefore it's a good thing to do i'll tell you what if i had
02:13:12 lots of money like millions of dollars billion if i had fucking you know notch money i would be like
02:13:18 notch but way stronger like i would just pay people to do art all the time strong like i would
02:13:25 like nobody's stronger than notch if i had a billion dollars i would go on youtube look at all
02:13:30 the people who obviously want to have full-time jobs doing your videos and i'd be like yo close
02:13:36 your patreon that has a sad like seven dollars a month on it i will pay you a full-time wage to
02:13:44 make this on a contract basis right that's what i would do you know that's nice because i believe
02:13:50 in art i don't believe in disease free third world nations leave that shit to bill gates you
02:13:57 see that's the thing the only way the fallacy of spending money is that it doesn't necessarily
02:14:03 get you exactly what you want you can spend a billion dollars to have something happen but if
02:14:08 you're not there making sure the money's being spent correctly it doesn't make shit that's why
02:14:13 the bill and melinda gates foundation does do legitimate good in the world yeah yeah gates is
02:14:20 full-time fucking job it doesn't just take all his money it takes all of his fucking time
02:14:26 and if bill gates didn't do it he would be considered like evil by the world just by virtue
02:14:32 of having that money so he gets something out of it but i just assumed if he had spent the same
02:14:36 amount of money on charity but just threw the money to like the most honest earnest sounding bitter
02:14:43 you wouldn't vaccinate shit well yeah agreed uh probably it's like that that's that's my point
02:14:50 like okay when i think about like it like yeah exactly as you were saying debu there's like
02:14:55 people out there who just aren't making enough money doing what they want to do and you know i have
02:14:59 a little bit of conflicting feelings because i think to myself like okay i value what this person
02:15:03 is doing but if they're so unpopular that like they haven't been able to like capitalize on this
02:15:08 and like make it a successful business like i know not everyone's a great businessman but like will
02:15:13 this even succeed long term if i subsidize it so there's like concerns about that it's not about
02:15:17 me it's not about trying to push stuff out the boat that is going to be successful it's about me
02:15:22 wanting certain art to exist okay sure i remember there's this documentary i only have seen the
02:15:27 commercials all this relay the commercials information about the guy who made five-hour energy
02:15:32 he became a god damn billionaire and spent 99 percent of it on just charity and fucking like
02:15:38 uh philanthropy he basically built this huge fucking like science lab where he just gives
02:15:46 scientists and engineers free money to build cool shit that can help the poor like a a hand-cranked
02:15:52 water filtration bitch type of thing right like so basically he spends his money on very specific
02:15:58 things that can very specifically help people in specific ways like when um james ralph recently
02:16:03 like a couple years back did a charity where he was auctioning off some old avg and set pieces or
02:16:09 like scripts and the money was going to charity but it was very specifically going to the hospital
02:16:16 this like this like specialty hospital that like saved his daughter's life right well sure okay
02:16:22 basically like his daughter wasn't treated properly when she was born so he took her to this other
02:16:27 medical specialty place and they like basically uh resulted in his daughter not being like
02:16:34 permanently disabled because they knew what the fuck they were doing right so james ralph was like
02:16:38 all right if i ever do a charity it's gonna be these guys right because they're very specific
02:16:43 people who i actually know right mm-hmm so that that's the thing about why i think it's bad to
02:16:51 like not bad but i think it's misguided to think that if you have money you must give the charity
02:16:55 because yes you could have a million times more money than someone else but we all only have 24
02:17:04 hours in the day and doing good takes time not money i mean takes you know and that's very true
02:17:10 and i like i can make another argument here that like okay who's gonna do more with the money for
02:17:16 the world like some like elon musk or like some poor kid in chicago like you know maybe that kid is
02:17:23 like a super genius and like he'll use that money and like get somewhere in life and go really far
02:17:28 but we've got a track record with elon he's doing good work over here with all his money i don't know
02:17:33 if i necessarily agree with the sentimentality of we just have to like put all of our resources into
02:17:39 like like the rich and powerful and and genius well i mean in this particular case it's an argument
02:17:45 to like take elon's money to give to like poor people which of course i am not in favor of uh
02:17:52 but yeah i i i it again it comes down to the individual decision of just i like poor black
02:17:58 kids in chicago let me give the money if i like everybody i just choose to wait there was infinite
02:18:04 money and infinite resources of course we want everybody to have it uh it's just a matter it's
02:18:08 a matter of you know distribution um i don't think i don't think it like like i don't think it needs
02:18:13 to be a matter of of of moral ambiguity to just do to just give money to who you want to give money
02:18:19 to win and if and not what i you choose to do i i disagree i mean to certain degrees because like
02:18:26 if i give so well just like there can be cases where like if i give so much money that i personally
02:18:32 let's just say i give so much money that i starve to death because i can't buy money for myself
02:18:35 just as an edge case obviously that is that is not ideal you don't want to go that far that's
02:18:41 too much even if the people that you're giving money to survive only because you gave money
02:18:46 and maybe more people survive than you die the question is what will they do with their lives
02:18:52 we have to make these calculations now because we're dealing with these sort of like that's
02:18:56 that's what we're talking about we're trafficking in direct human life at this point the human
02:19:02 trafficking and what they'll do with their lives is i'm a human trafficker is that they will be happy
02:19:08 uh correct correct but and that's what people want is for other people i have now completely
02:19:14 forgotten and just now remember this is a question this isn't just a continuation of the topic
02:19:20 yeah that's true just do any of you give to charities why why not i'll make one last point
02:19:24 in favor of munchie basically in this point which is just like if i could for if you think about for
02:19:28 example like in the middle in the middle ages like there were probably like super genius kids born
02:19:34 to just like dirt poor surf families and like they obviously had like no opportunity to like
02:19:38 succeed and we're just like trampled and you know died never getting a chance to succeed
02:19:42 i want all those people to have an opportunity to succeed across the world so like yeah where
02:19:48 charity where charity can do those sorts of things i absolutely wanted to do so though i don't believe
02:19:52 in like extracting money from people if they don't choose to i don't when this when this person said
02:19:58 like would you give charity i i don't like believe in like really like huge big charities or anything
02:20:05 i just want to like analyze like just giving two things that i feel deserve money and slash or
02:20:11 attention yeah i don't have any particular like uh standards or or beliefs like that i
02:20:18 want to give to that i can like think of right now mm-hmm you know i'm saying like like there's no
02:20:23 charity that i that i am like itching to give money to i'm just like like the idea of giving money
02:20:30 to other people does not repulse me i it doesn't repulse me either it just depends on this like
02:20:35 sometimes it does repulse me other times it doesn't you know yeah sometimes repulses me too
02:20:39 yeah there you go there you go we don't anyone else want to win this no tom would you give
02:20:44 it oh tom is the charity case right i forgot i've been ben what do you think just real quick uh
02:20:51 if i had like more money than i knew what to do with than maybe but like i'd have to be really
02:20:56 i'd have to like really know like what the money was going to yeah like i would just have to be
02:21:01 thoroughly convinced that the money was actually making a real difference and not you know that's
02:21:07 it makes sense to me uh one other uh twitter question here from at doombox two favorite
02:21:14 anime okay moving on we're going to be uh to the piece to the patreon lounge questions over here
02:21:19 this is why we have bad comments is because you read them aloud and they think they're really
02:21:24 funny that one is funny it was a joke comment god damn it all right we've had that joke like four
02:21:30 i like it every time all right here's an actual good question yeah an actual good question here
02:21:37 discount gumshoe asks this is a great question for this topic i told everybody that we're doing
02:21:42 the job's topic uh okay will the chad artist or just you know or will the artist ever be free of the
02:21:48 you don't work hard meme that the virgin wage cucks have forced upon us you don't understand what he's
02:21:54 asking here like so so often so often you'll be like an online content creator like a video maker
02:22:00 or like a draw boy and you'll say those you know you'll meet someone out they'll be like hey what do
02:22:04 you do uh so you know i'm i'm a i'm a youtuber i'm an artist you know i do commissions and they're
02:22:08 like oh no what about a real job though what's your oh you know never be free because inherently
02:22:15 being an artist means that what you that you're doing what you you're you're you're choosing your own
02:22:20 work and it's just i think it's just inherently less punishing and it's just it's going to be seen
02:22:25 by those who have to do stuff they don't want to do for a living you know it's going to be seen that
02:22:30 way no matter what and i don't even blame it like i think that's kind of reasonable i don't think
02:22:34 what the work of an artist and the work of a wage cucks virgin wage cucks they they are of the
02:22:44 opinion that work is supposed to be like grueling and hard and bad they the word work has negative
02:22:52 connotation to them because they are virgin wage cuck bitches yeah and so they they feel the need
02:22:59 that like oh like work needs to be hard because i'm because you know it's hard for me because i don't
02:23:05 want to do any work i'm just a worthless piece of shit but like artists are doing work objectively
02:23:11 they're just doing work that they enjoy and that doesn't make them feel bad
02:23:16 yeah man like i don't see like virgin wage cuck comments in my preview much like let's just face
02:23:24 back plenty of artists are pretty damn lazy a lot of people don't realize how i think the real
02:23:31 issue here is discrimination like artists being called inherently like not working hard like some
02:23:36 subset of my experience might be really skewed or wrong but i just see that if you are obviously
02:23:43 working really fucking hard it's gonna show and people are gonna not say that shit right you
02:23:49 know the only reason i disagree with that divu is because of like stuff that like tom will retweet
02:23:54 where like people i i don't even know like i kind of am skeptical as to how often this even happens
02:23:58 but like tom will retweet these like horror stories sometimes of like someone like he's like
02:24:03 hey would you draw my oc and they're like sure it's like a hundred dollars like
02:24:08 you expect to be fucking paid for that piece of shit and you know like that attitude is kind of
02:24:13 inherent here it's like how i'm sorry my body's still fucking high uh it's like how could you
02:24:18 possibly not expect someone to request some form of compensation i feel like that's just that's in
02:24:23 the mix here somewhere you know what i mean that's like me and me and divu me and divu staged one
02:24:28 right yeah and it took seven fucking months to do it you goddamn non-worker yeah i just sat on it
02:24:35 and didn't post it for months and i don't know why yeah so it was a perfect example of lazy
02:24:40 artists ladies and gentlemen there they are yeah all artists don't work you see i can feel why why
02:24:48 munchy would would be so strident fighting back against this because we all know how hard a worker
02:24:52 munchy is and the crazy stuff he's always cooking up uh i could i feel the same way you know like
02:24:58 the content that i make is is generally very high effort i'm currently fighting against that but
02:25:03 was that not sarcasm just now i was sincere just now whoa what do you mean i think i it feels so
02:25:10 weird for someone to have nate compliment me it doesn't i come with people all the time that was
02:25:16 so bizarre i was just waiting for the like like like oh we all we all know what munchy's always
02:25:21 cooking up a fucking faggot let's go ahead dude yeah my answer to that question so people
02:25:28 can't tell i'm sincere my answer to that question is really just fucking if you want those people
02:25:34 to go away i think that if you just work harder people will see it you know like yes you can say
02:25:42 oh it's you know it's not actually easy to draw yeah but i see artists of equal drawing quality
02:25:49 who are like five times more prolific than the other one you know sure you know what i mean like
02:25:55 there's definitely you know what it comes down to the the question is will like the artist ever
02:25:59 be free of this like meme that's you know discrimination or whatever the answer is basically
02:26:04 what ben was saying it's really no like because there's this kind of there's this kind of like
02:26:10 competition between the two yeah because people associate work with like bad unfun stuff as long
02:26:15 as that exists right there will be but there's here but you individually can absolutely rise
02:26:19 above it there's a much stronger reputation uh deriding those who are stuck in entry level jobs
02:26:27 as being underachievers who coast on minimal you know clock in your nine to five every day
02:26:32 and then go home and do nothing right so i think though i think that stigma is probably worse and
02:26:39 more hard to get rid of so i think uh i think everyone in any position is going to be faced with
02:26:46 some sort of prejudice about not being hard enough yeah he's gotta be hard even if you're
02:26:52 successful and rich people are gonna be like oh this guy didn't fucking work to be rich right yeah
02:26:56 yeah and there's the whole like yeah there's the management fallacy where people don't people are
02:26:59 like you don't do fucking work you just tell other people to do work why are you getting paid so much
02:27:04 money kills me that's the fucking capital uh fucking communist mindset in a nutshell yeah those
02:27:08 bitches need to watch winter wrap up where you see the true value of someone whose skill is
02:27:13 organization yeah people need to fucking watch season one winter fucking wrap up organization
02:27:18 matters people get the fucking right the the problems they just don't understand what managers
02:27:23 actually do uh and some are lazy yeah you know what you know what this is actually kind of relevant
02:27:28 to this in general because like i think of a lot of the reason people think art is just easy
02:27:33 and they assume they're lazy is because they don't know how hard artists can actually work
02:27:37 because they don't understand the process yeah of it being made you know idea that like artists are
02:27:41 just talented you know yeah they just have an inability that's true and just for my realm of
02:27:47 experience like when you post a video bam the video just for the viewer it didn't exist now
02:27:52 magically it exists but they don't see the months of work and the editing and the recording and you
02:27:57 know all that shit that that's one of the things mean mean been starting to go back to
02:28:02 reference copulars but but we're trying out streaming and that's like the main thing that I
02:28:08 think like like we're trying to see if we want to do that full time yeah and it's looking pretty
02:28:12 great and like i think it's well suited to our long form content but the satisfaction that the
02:28:18 reference specialist fans get from just waking up on some random day and you are just blessed out
02:28:26 of the blue by by a ravers cop killers video by six seven hours long yeah yes it just it spawns out
02:28:33 of nowhere it's great it's a great feeling it's a great feeling i think that's a large part of why
02:28:38 youtube is so fun you know it's just fun to be subscribed see a huge video drop everybody loves
02:28:44 it plays off that like slot machine mentality where it's just like i wonder if it's gonna be here
02:28:48 today it's the skinner box it's like you know small like random random rewards more or less yeah
02:28:55 youtube subscriptions are loot boxes we need to ban online gambling such as subscribing to anyone on
02:29:01 youtube it's a gamble and we can't allow it we need harsh regulations that that's why there's such a
02:29:06 little Amish population and like demographics on youtube is because it's a form of gambling they
02:29:10 can't do it that's the reason all right two more points before we go on the next question okay first
02:29:15 of all uh just really quick here unrelated uh i just realized the other day that we actually passed
02:29:21 the two-year anniversary of ravers cop killers on uh april 11th so yeah well the debut was on that
02:29:27 first one so right yeah dude the pcp is also passed or not aware yesterday was homestuck day
02:29:35 yeah it was right i know right i wish i hadn't been so sick i would have fucking done something for it
02:29:41 i would have been stuck you were stuck at home and i was so upset you know i was going to make
02:29:47 armors people fan art because i don't want to disrespect homestuck by just like not even
02:29:51 acknowledging that it was there all right but the real thing that actually is related to this
02:29:56 is the one like like like the biggest influence or the biggest positive influence the pcp has had
02:30:04 my life uh that's completely changed the way i perceive something was the insistence and and
02:30:10 me realizing that work is and should be good yes work should have no negative connotations
02:30:17 and it should be a pure positive because you know like i had grown up and my mom would come home
02:30:24 for like oh working this fucking so bad and i hate it so much uh but like when i yesterday yesterday
02:30:30 was or two days i lose track of all time because uh because i don't perceive time the same way other
02:30:35 people do i'm a cryptid uh i i worked for like like six hours on that one feeling closer to death
02:30:42 like vlog video i worked so hard that i had to like get footage of like a range things and then
02:30:46 after it was done i was so fucking happy that i had put in the work to make that and i had gone
02:30:53 like like this guy like like like call me on skype and i had to like do some like green
02:30:57 green screening shit right i had to like arrange a footage like frame by frame for a certain part
02:31:02 it was fucking it was great and i was so happy that i had done it and and and just the fact that
02:31:06 i could sit back and think wow i put in so much work what what a good what a good day this yeah
02:31:12 that's the feeling that i love more than anything else you think real smart and you'll get real
02:31:17 lucky work can be nothing but good when it comes to like editing videos there's lots of parts that
02:31:24 are just constantly creative but then in parts where it's more like grudge work uh then you can
02:31:30 put on a podcast because there's parts of your brain that are being unoccupied because it's
02:31:34 boring but then there's parts where it has to be stupid there's just no two way you cannot be
02:31:39 cognizant while doing this part so then you can get drunk for that part you see if you play your
02:31:44 cards correctly you could smooth over the experience of every part of the production and if you can't
02:31:50 then you're doing something wrong and and furthermore if you are listening to this podcast right now
02:31:57 if you have found your way here and you are you are intelligent enough to be listening to this right
02:32:01 now i guarantee you can have the life that you envision for yourself ideally in i would say
02:32:08 five to ten years of investment no matter how you work right fucking now yeah if you get to it now
02:32:14 and whenever you start like if you want to start for a year that's fine but then there'll be five
02:32:18 to ten years from then so you know whatever you want to do buddy that's that's the sooner you'll
02:32:22 get it to pay off and when you start doing the thing you want to do we're think about how to make
02:32:27 it a like economically viable if it will never be economically viable except the fact that you'll
02:32:31 need to have a side job and then maybe one day you'll be you'll be doing this 20 years later and
02:32:35 you'll realize huh you know what i guess i don't need my side job i really can do this full time
02:32:39 because you never know if the what matters is to just be working towards the things that you want
02:32:43 to do that aren't economically viable that's probably a hobby and hobbies are cool yeah so there you go
02:32:49 that's true hobbies the ladies love hobbies guys the ladies love doing it and what it takes
02:32:54 is working a job to make it possible then you know you got to do that you know what i'll say
02:32:59 about this if it's what you want then it should be worth it i i said before that a lot of this
02:33:03 is motivated by my deep sexual insecurities as a man and uh i feel like that really did motivate me
02:33:10 in in one sense here that was like i once heard advice uh in my in my old days of researching
02:33:15 like how to be attractive and how to be cool and stuff and i i read a thing that just like women
02:33:20 just love men with passion and like it's you got two choices one make your full-time job your passion
02:33:26 so that you're excited to go there every day and you have something to talk about to like the ladies
02:33:31 or whatever so that you you are full of interesting and exciting things that are that like a woman
02:33:35 would want to be a part of there's that option or if it's not your full-time job and if you're if
02:33:40 you don't like your full-time job then you've got to make yourself like your hobby your your purpose
02:33:45 in life you've got to have something in you that's burning inside as like a desire to reach and yeah
02:33:51 so that you have things to share with people that's what it's all about man and and having that inside
02:33:55 me both motivated me to like improve my life so i would like be able you know just like all the
02:34:00 normal stuff of like wanting the things i want having you know control over my life and that
02:34:03 and then also it tied into my you know wanting to like be attractive to women and stuff it was
02:34:08 helpful in two ways yeah i completely agree with everything that you just said but i just hate sex
02:34:12 so much so i'm just going to say do everything nate said but do it for yourself for inner fulfillment
02:34:18 what i'm describing is basically a cheat code it's a cheat code if you attach your desire to get
02:34:22 girls to this that might help you as well it did for me entirely how i've gotten a fucking person
02:34:28 i think like the the the hilarious side effect of that is if you do nate's cheat by the time you
02:34:33 get like so fucking good and like your life is so good you realize you don't even fucking need to
02:34:37 fuck that much because that's yeah that that's a real secret dude the real thing that is more
02:34:42 important and like like there's guys out there was inside you all along there are guys out there
02:34:46 who enjoy a fucking new bitch like every single day but your average guy what they're interested in
02:34:52 is like i i mean this is my experience i think your most average guy just wants a girlfriend
02:34:56 who makes him happy you know he's pretty hot we all want that and even whatever way you define
02:35:01 that as and uh like you just feel contented like that part of your life is satisfied i think that's
02:35:07 a very common thing that a lot of people want and like if personally on my quest that took
02:35:11 fucking a bunch of bitches that's what it took for me to realize that about myself and uh but now i
02:35:16 know now i know and i'm pretty content i would tell my fiance back when we were just like dating
02:35:21 and shit i just asked her like why the fuck do you find me attractive like i don't i don't know
02:35:27 why i'm that hot to you and she said okay well you know quentin tarantino and i was like what and
02:35:33 so she compared me to quentin tarantino and then she's into people like quentin tarantino
02:35:39 the madman himself fucking shrimpy fucking egotistical a guy like that when when billy
02:35:46 mitchell has fallen from grace recently for being a cheater she was really sad about that too because
02:35:51 she really likes billy mitchell for the same reasons and i was like oh wow yeah i went when i
02:35:57 was i totally get that it's a passion man yeah when i was 15 i realized oh i should just like
02:36:02 not care about like trying to impress girls and i will just make myself impressed with myself
02:36:09 and yeah basically ever since then it's been pretty easy you just you just don't even think about it
02:36:13 and you just get pussy jumping on your ass all day you gotta do it we should really have
02:36:19 we should really have an entire episode about relationship so so so we can get into this
02:36:23 but i'm much more far online with the devoo of just improve yourself and obviously people who
02:36:28 like the improved you which is to say the you that you want and should be we'll just naturally
02:36:34 gravitate towards you yeah i mean i told you that's that's the that's the basic uh logic find it
02:36:40 we've been going for almost three hours yeah we gotta start we gotta start rapping
02:36:47 i've been like the last hour we've been talking about getting hype and doing your work i've been
02:36:52 looking at this file that i started before the podcast it's like i really just want to
02:36:55 fucking work on this it's okay you know what i i totally feel i totally feel it for that sake
02:36:59 let's let's just get a question to a little bang them out real fast yeah yeah rap is shit out
02:37:04 here's one that i well i want to answer by one spar bleakly and in the patreon lounge
02:37:09 since shitty questions is a big pcp meme now will there be questioners rules episode uh on the
02:37:16 podcast like like commenter and reviewer rules i think that would be funny and possibly a decent
02:37:23 topic i could see doing it i what i would want to do is i want i would want to like replace the
02:37:28 question section of an episode with questioner rules so we can have like a dual topic kind of
02:37:33 because because i don't know if we have enough to say that will fill like an entire episode
02:37:37 but i don't know about that okay okay to like to like address how bad the questions are i think
02:37:43 we could do that i'm in favor of doing i think that would be cool i think that'd be some idea
02:37:47 such a boner killer to have a whole episode on like questioner rules and then have to take
02:37:51 the shitty questions after laying it all out but they perfect perfect examples of what what how to
02:37:56 do it wrong which i'm sure it will be without a cable out of town maybe um all right well you
02:38:02 know what uh this is okay this is an interesting question grace you asks i got my masters and
02:38:09 and i guess this thing and i'm still struggle oh and i still struggle to get a job how can you
02:38:14 really stand out fancier resume formatting interview tips so okay well if we're the ones
02:38:21 to be asking about this yeah yeah i like there's a million things you could say about this i just
02:38:25 i thought this was a heartfelt question that this person's looking for for information on
02:38:29 a little help so just i don't know my my thoughts on this are damn you already got a masters and
02:38:34 you're struggling to get a job okay here's my here's my real question okay like what's the masters in
02:38:39 i assume there's not a lot of demand for it uh i mean i suppose you could be shit and you could
02:38:43 be like bad that's entirely possible um okay like there's no cheat to like one one weird old tip
02:38:51 to like stand out or anything i would say what what people want is just competency at the at the
02:38:57 end of the day they're gonna take whoever looks like they're best at the job so like how do you
02:39:02 demonstrate that here's what i would do i don't know what your field is for me like one thing
02:39:06 that really impressed people when i was applying for programming jobs was the work i did on my own
02:39:11 outside work just the side programming stuff i had going on so i don't know maybe you're like a
02:39:17 maybe you're a fucking writer or something you're trying to get like some job writing for a magazine
02:39:20 or something like have a blog have written to it try to make it popular you know just you know go
02:39:26 through the motions of doing the thing that they want like nobody wants a college kid who's only
02:39:31 learned a bunch of bullshit that probably isn't practically applicable they want someone who's
02:39:34 in the fucking trenches already and they know can easily plop into a slot so what like resume
02:39:40 formatting interview tips like i don't know if you have like terrible time interviewing and
02:39:44 you're constantly fucking it up then like yeah obviously you should work on that in in whatever
02:39:48 way i'm sure there's lots of resources for that fancier resume formatting man we're just we're
02:39:53 beating around the edges the core issue is have be able to tell them why you're great and how you're
02:39:59 perfect for this and all that shit like you want them to believe that you're worth the job
02:40:04 do you believe that you're worth the job good yeah yeah you gotta you gotta impress him a little
02:40:12 peacocking in terms of what you can do does not hurt you never heard that's right that's right
02:40:19 kstep in the questions bar asks thoughts on the tick with take your dog we were actually playing
02:40:23 on doing i thought we should do that as the topic today nobody wanted to do it because they didn't
02:40:28 want to get into the weeds of the drama i didn't even want to talk about the drama literally just
02:40:32 figured out how we can do well okay tig with a bring it up is inherently linked because it's
02:40:37 popular right now it's a property talk about right now because the drama i mean i know i just figured
02:40:43 it out here's how we can do an episode about the episode will be called internet content creator
02:40:48 group incompetence or maybe somebody shorter that way we can compare and contrast our own
02:40:55 competence or lack thereof to tig with tags because there's a lot of times where i'm thinking
02:41:00 man we sure are a lot less masturbatory here's here's my i mean there are many differences
02:41:06 and i guess there's some similarities but like right out of the gate here here are my thoughts
02:41:09 on the tig with take doc kstep i have not read it and i am not a lawyer i have i don't trust anyone
02:41:17 who just says i had x experience i demand evidence before i think anything about anyone
02:41:23 and to do otherwise anyone in the world is immoral so i hope that like everyone we could what are
02:41:31 you supposed to say right now like oh they're all bad because a lot of people said they were bad
02:41:34 is that true where's the proof like were the police involved like there was like sexual allegations
02:41:39 is any of that substantiated i don't fucking know i have no grounds to make any assessment
02:41:44 whatsoever and frankly it pisses me off that people just take the word of people when they
02:41:49 just assert things without evidence agreed no need to me dude don't you think it's fucked up that
02:41:55 like we think this culture now is just like an allegation can tank an entire business that's the
02:42:01 problem that's the problem but and i read some of that stuff most of it is people being awkward
02:42:07 and just not communicating clearly like some people have sexual crime allegations literally
02:42:12 go to the cops and tell them everything and work it out it's not the court of public opinions job
02:42:17 to judge if you were like abused at your job it's your job to figure it out yeah why are you like
02:42:22 why am i involved i don't care at all about the um the issue of like whether or not they should
02:42:27 like it should be sued or some shit like that or defamation yeah like wait what is tick with tick
02:42:32 actually tanking right now as a result is channel awesome like actually like financially i believe
02:42:37 that as a note like basically none of their fans gave a shit and that it didn't matter right exactly
02:42:41 for me this is like a bunch of people leave the site though like i a bunch of people have been
02:42:47 leaving the site for the reasons that have been explained in a document that it's it's
02:42:50 shit to work for them right but for me what i take away from it is it's an interesting case study in
02:42:56 incompetence and hubris basically imagine if you listening at home have you read it do have you read
02:43:01 i scammed a shitload of it and i read all of lindsay ellis's part because she's the one good
02:43:06 writer in the group so okay so be aware that's what we're working with that's the information
02:43:10 not only have i said reports being referred to by davoo now okay not only have i skimmed most of it
02:43:16 and a lot of it was the same complaints listed over and over again so i saw the gist of it but
02:43:21 also i am the one in this group who's seen the most tick with a with like hippo at a close second i
02:43:25 believe right so i do have a lot of understanding of this group i've been i mean i i've started
02:43:31 following them like ten goddamn years ago right and it totally makes sense to me now imagine if you
02:43:38 as in you the audience listening at home did some weird shit on the internet that somehow got
02:43:43 popular and now suddenly you have all this power your dug walk or you have all this power to get
02:43:48 a bunch of little spurgies flocking to your throne to mooch off of your fame and now you
02:43:55 have the power to coordinate them to do these giant skit movies together if you guys didn't know that
02:44:00 was where most of these complaints come from is is the production of the big tick with tick crossover
02:44:05 movies where they did the anniversary stuff yeah and it was like making a whole movie but like you
02:44:10 know home video style and people were just explaining in depth how dug and his brother rob
02:44:16 and the producer mike mccodd were just totally didn't know the single first fucking thing that
02:44:22 they were doing but because they were in this position of power no one could like question them
02:44:27 and mike mccodd would like you know bat down anyone who did question them so dug always
02:44:32 side as everything is going really well and everybody's really happy but then meanwhile
02:44:36 the people working for them are like why the you didn't think to give us food on this set
02:44:42 what the fuck right like oh that's so that's so retarded that like this is like the major issue
02:44:50 they didn't even give us food or water on the set like this is the big issue this is what you've got
02:44:57 this is the damning evidence oh my god shut the fuck up i don't care about your stupid baby problems
02:45:03 fucking go to starbucks across embarrassing like it's like it's embarrassing that they would make
02:45:09 such an oversight no i think it's absolutely appropriate that most tick with ticks fans don't
02:45:13 care and they continue to watch the videos yes i don't think okay it does sound like mike mccodd
02:45:18 might be kind of a bad person dug and robber just sort of like oh why would he be a bad person
02:45:22 what is he done because he sort of was a fucking creep about like people like being critical of the
02:45:28 website not like damning critical not like defamation critical but like saying problems that they have
02:45:33 that are pretty innocuous mike mccodd would be like shut the fuck up you don't get to say that right
02:45:37 or you're fired right he's a man defending his business whatever i don't know unless it is something
02:45:41 directly more of a criminal on behalf of dug and rob walker they're just they were just fucking
02:45:46 over privileged fucking white boys who don't understand like how to take care of shit and it
02:45:51 pissed a lot of people i don't even agree with that i don't even agree with that shit like what the
02:45:55 hell i didn't read the fucking document i don't deserve to comment on this none of us too i bet
02:46:00 the people who fucking wrote the thing i don't even know half of what the fuck they're talking about
02:46:04 because none of this shit's serious and it's all like little baby complaints if it's more than a
02:46:09 baby complaint it should be with the fucking police it should not be the court of fucking opinion
02:46:15 public opinion i just like this is such a bitch move no they're just trying to ruin the reputation
02:46:21 of a fucking company and what did they really do they didn't give us fucking water on our fucking
02:46:26 coffee break when we were at this big meetup thing bring a fucking water bottle go to the
02:46:31 fuck to shaws and buy one no let me explain yes i do totally agree that this is why they were able
02:46:37 to be kicked around so much and and and i'm no people are gonna get mad at me because i'm sure
02:46:41 there's more serious stuff than what i'm bringing up i'm just focusing on the stuff that i'm biased
02:46:44 toward that's exactly why i know what you'd listen to me either no one should care to anyone on this
02:46:49 issue well please go on actually like kind of have to go so like if we don't wrap up soon i'm
02:46:55 gonna have to leave okay i'll say okay i'll say yeah the thing is the reason why these people were
02:47:00 kicked around is that they're all talentless fucks like almost all of tag is just non-entities right
02:47:06 like there was no formula more boring that was that was brought to prominent popularity on the
02:47:12 internet until the cinemasans fucking plague hit the world right so like they didn't really have
02:47:17 any power they didn't have the ability to like strike out and do their own thing they were completely
02:47:22 leaching off of Doug Doug's popularity so you can see in the article most of them writing their
02:47:28 complaints in this document are too incompetent to make a compelling case i had to sort of unpack
02:47:33 what they're saying detach what they're actually saying from what they think they're saying and
02:47:38 then come out with an accurate explanation they're putting it like we've been mistreated and abused
02:47:43 and hurt and fucked them and there's a little bit of that but again Lindsay Ellis the Nostalgia
02:47:49 Chick the one really talented person who ever graced that website her whole case was presented
02:47:54 much better she simply explained how Doug was not capable of arranging this shit it was disorganized
02:48:01 people were like he was constantly fighting with his brother like in front of people about like
02:48:05 script disappearance it was just embarrassing and wasn't so is that really what it is though
02:48:11 it was just an embarrassing situation is that the crime it was embarrassing and also way too stressful
02:48:15 and stupid and it could have been so much better like she even explained like i went up to Doug
02:48:20 being like yo we're on a set we're not there's their first big movie was like in the middle of
02:48:24 nowhere i think there weren't a whole lot of restaurants around and she said yo what about
02:48:29 food and Doug was like i don't know but then like fucking spoonie came up and said well you know
02:48:34 food is typically provided on a movie set and he was like maybe you're maybe you're right spoonie
02:48:38 maybe i should well lock up the fucking misogynist i guess i know right what men say i know i know
02:48:44 anyway the point is it's just a story of incompetence and hubris and not realizing that like people
02:48:50 aren't having nearly as much fun as you are and i totally believe that happened i believe all of that
02:48:57 i 100% believe every story in there but i just don't give a shit yeah but name because i don't
02:49:02 think these are serious problems except for the sexual allegations take them to the fucking cops
02:49:06 yeah i'm not a dude but dude like when people portray this as the fall of the nostalgia critic
02:49:11 it's like no this is just finally people are pointing fingers when they should have been all
02:49:17 along like finally these i don't even like any of these people i watch this i have some positive
02:49:22 feelings towards the nostalgia critic because i like them i just don't like to see fucking witch
02:49:25 hunts and there's too many fucking witch hunts these days people are fucking cowards fucking
02:49:30 talked i mean whether you know it never mind yeah i love this fiery name but we should leave now
02:49:37 escape my right before i turn it against you okay you gotta get the fuck out of here i have nothing
02:49:42 else to say on this matter anyone else want to comment on this it's gay and i like it uh i
02:49:47 i agree i agree that if the allegations are criminal in nature then they should be taken up with the
02:49:53 police i just really don't think the people like us the viewers have should have like any involvement
02:49:59 in any of this it's like the whatever people can tell their stories if they're fucked up it's just
02:50:03 the way it is presented at a point where you can do more damage to somebody on twitter than through
02:50:09 legal means that's a good point tom that's a damn good point basically what i am saying here is way
02:50:13 back in 2008 when this site was brand fucking new i made a blog post i made a different forum post
02:50:18 saying yo you people like don't know what you're doing this is a giant shit show of talentless
02:50:24 and everyone came down my fucking door being like oh you're being a true old band band band right
02:50:30 but now 10 fucking years later the people who ran the people who consisted of most of the shitty
