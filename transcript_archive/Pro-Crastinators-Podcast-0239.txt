00:00:00 Hello everyone, welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast for another exciting week!
00:00:12 We got me, Ben Saint, we got Digi, we got Gibbontake, and we got our special guest this week is
00:00:25 Mer Logic, who you might know as Wonder Bread Guy, the guy who makes the pictures, who commissions
00:00:34 the all the pictures of blonde women with Wonder Bread doing deforestation.
00:00:38 Eleazar, pause the video and play, show a cascade of those images going across the screen
00:01:15 Kevin MacLeod tracks.
00:01:17 Man, y'all are so lucky this isn't Twitch, cause we've already been copyright clammed
00:01:22 by now because of how their fucking guidelines have been as of the past couple of days.
00:01:25 Like, what do you mean?
00:01:27 Like just for mentioning songs?
00:01:30 Just any music in general gets the DMCA fucking raging like you wouldn't believe.
00:01:36 That's true.
00:01:38 So Mer Logic, I have to ask you immediately.
00:01:42 Have you ever commissioned cosplay girls to do live, do you have any interest in live
00:01:48 action photographs of girls with bread?
00:01:52 Here's the story, I have my own Tumblr page, not my own personal Tumblr page, I'm talking
00:01:58 about a page where somebody thought it'd be funny to make a Tumblr page dedicated to
00:02:03 round references to my shitposting, and I found that Tumblr page by accident, and when
00:02:10 I was scrolling through what was in this Tumblr page, somewhere at the very bottom, there
00:02:15 was a picture of a girl who was looking for a Halloween costume because she was trying
00:02:21 to go and she thought, and I've even personally talked to this person, she thought it'd be
00:02:26 funny if I were to draw myself as one of Mer's commissions and then go to the party and then
00:02:33 have them wonder just what the fuck I'm supposed to be.
00:02:36 So she dressed up like one of my commissions and then went to that party and then wrote
00:02:41 a post about how she went to the party, they had no idea who the fuck she was supposed
00:02:47 to be, and when she posted that on Reddit, everybody was like, what have you done?
00:02:53 Why are you trying to, why are you trying to awake the quote unquote ancient one because
00:02:58 they act like I'm some kind of demon that only fucking summons itself if you get the
00:03:03 right summoning salt and you make it in the right single shape, so I wouldn't talk to
00:03:08 this girl, and she was like, yeah, I came up with the idea just on a whim, it was the
00:03:14 only Halloween costume I could think of to make, I'm a little surprised you were able
00:03:20 to find it, I mean, yeah, you're directly referencing me, how the hell would I not find
00:03:24 it?
00:03:25 Wait, so you didn't ask her to do it, she did it as a joke.
00:03:28 She came up with this idea on her own, she went to the party dressing, yeah.
00:03:33 So they were right, she did summon you with this arcane ritual.
00:03:37 It was ridiculous, but yes, I haven't personally paid someone to cosplay for me, but I have
00:03:44 had people dress as my commissions.
00:03:47 That's the way to do it, you just get your reputation to buy your own way and you don't
00:03:51 have to pay for shit, yeah.
00:03:53 Okay, people's heads rent free.
00:03:56 Yeah, yeah.
00:03:58 So what you do, if I'm understanding correctly, is you have commissioned various artists
00:04:06 to draw, I don't know.
00:04:09 I want to ballpark, how many artists do you think you've commissioned total?
00:04:12 Wait, I was going to let you know this guy.
00:04:18 I know, I've heard and seen a few of the images, but I'm not entirely sure as to what
00:04:23 the deal is.
00:04:24 Maybe we should make scale.
00:04:25 Is it a scale?
00:04:26 It's a scale that is impressive.
00:04:27 No.
00:04:28 Actually legitimate.
00:04:29 I've seen...
00:04:30 Are you interested in this thing?
00:04:31 I've seen many of them in this thing.
00:04:33 Which is cool, that's epic.
00:04:37 Can you explain the appeal briefly?
00:04:40 But does our audience know?
00:04:42 Is our audience going to be completely lost if we don't?
00:04:44 They will probably have no fucking idea.
00:04:45 I don't think most of our audience will know anything about Murlocic, so...
00:04:48 I mean, I briefly said what his deal is.
00:04:51 I don't know, he's known far and wide for...
00:04:53 Eleazar, show another cascade of these images going across the screen, set to a kiss from
00:04:59 a rose.
00:05:00 I mean, the images themselves may be famous, but I've heard him talk about what...
00:05:06 I have heard you talk about what is the appeal.
00:05:08 I am interested in you talking about it again, if you could explain to these guys.
00:05:14 That's the question that's the obvious question as far as I'm concerned.
00:05:18 When someone is confronted with your uvra, with your body of work, it's like, what is
00:05:23 the animating force behind this?
00:05:25 So I have a copypasta written about this.
00:05:30 I don't know if one of you wants to read it to get like a broader idea.
00:05:33 Sure.
00:05:34 I'll read it.
00:05:35 Should I just post it in general chat?
00:05:37 Yeah.
00:05:38 Yeah, go for it.
00:05:39 Sure.
00:05:40 I went and copy pasted this while we were in the middle of the recording process of
00:05:45 someone...
00:05:46 Oh, Christ.
00:05:47 Yes, so if someone wants to read that...
00:05:49 Wait, wait, wait.
00:05:50 You wrote this?
00:05:51 Yes.
00:05:52 Okay.
00:05:53 And it's close to blonde girl voice as I can.
00:05:56 Wait, why don't you read it, Murr?
00:05:58 Because I've read this...
00:05:59 I want to do it.
00:06:00 I tried to read this on the fucking The Dick Show, but I couldn't read it.
00:06:04 The Dick Show.
00:06:05 He wouldn't let him read it.
00:06:06 Yeah.
00:06:07 Okay.
00:06:08 All right.
00:06:09 It's a parallel on how normally society identifies negative stereotypes, but they only ever stereotype
00:06:13 it in a way that fits their narrative.
00:06:15 Let me explain it like this.
00:06:17 How often do you watch cartoons or animation of any variety where they decide to do an episode
00:06:22 where the theme of the episode is about spreading either an environmental message or they create
00:06:26 a character for the sole purpose of helping to spread an environmental message?
00:06:31 When people, animators, slash writers, whatever, feel the need to make plots like this, their
00:06:35 archetype of choice on how they write the episode is, let's draw a white, tall, shady-looking,
00:06:41 sometimes fat, really depends upon how cartoonish the show in question is, billionaire, one-dimensional
00:06:45 character who doesn't care or think about the long-term consequences for his actions
00:06:49 because as long as it continues to make money, he doesn't give a shit.
00:06:53 They've been making this one type of character in the industry for years.
00:06:55 I am so sick of seeing characters like this, not because it's a bad character type, but
00:06:59 because it's demonized to where people start to think, man, why would they even draw a
00:07:03 female equivalent to a character like this?
00:07:04 It just doesn't exist.
00:07:06 And yeah, it's hard how in the real world you need to really think about it if such a
00:07:09 character like this could ever exist in the real world, which is probably why it is so
00:07:12 easy to make a character like they have been making for what feels like forever now in
00:07:16 the cartoon world because that one character can represent.
00:07:19 Either one type of character that fits that narrative or a whole group of people that
00:07:23 could fit that narrative.
00:07:24 I'm just saying, we live in a world where a female equivalent to this character I am
00:07:27 describing is very rarely seen, so I wanted to bring more attention to this fact by making
00:07:31 more of them.
00:07:32 So what I'm getting out of this is like more female, evil, billionaires, Yasqueen, representation.
00:07:43 Before I got my dream gate art nuked, I had an instance where you've all seen that one
00:07:48 Tumblr post, that one Tumblr user going thermonuclear, that one infamous post that everyone knows
00:07:54 before.
00:07:56 I'm not sure if I do or not, to be honest, but go on.
00:08:01 It's the one where it goes like part of me believes.
00:08:04 It doesn't ring a bell, can we show it on screen?
00:08:07 I don't know.
00:08:08 All right, so there is a Tumblr user.
00:08:10 I'm not going to tell her your name because everybody can probably just look her up on
00:08:15 her own, but this Tumblr user, she's a commission artist, and here's the thing, I ask hundreds
00:08:22 upon hundreds upon thousands of commission artists by the hour every day, so eventually
00:08:30 after a while I tend to just forget how many people I ask commissions for, and I'm guessing
00:08:35 at one point she just kind of fell into that circle of people, and she got so asravaged
00:08:42 beyond all fucking comprehension that I asked her very generically if she could draw me
00:08:47 commissions that she went on to this fucking, you know, typical Tumblr shit show of rants
00:08:54 that everybody is ran, everybody knows before, and to take it a step further, she went on
00:09:01 my DeviantArt, and she complained about how she didn't like the art that was on my DeviantArt,
00:09:08 but here's the thing, the reason why she hated all of the art on my DeviantArt wasn't
00:09:13 because of the one thing I thought it'd be, because if you're a Tumblr user who's absolutely
00:09:19 fucking obsessed with wanting to push women empowerment, you're going to look at my art
00:09:23 and think, oh my god, look at all this sexist content, I'm so disgusted, my purits and eyes
00:09:28 can't handle it, no, that wasn't why she was angry, you want to know why she was angry?
00:09:33 and I shoot you now, this is a direct quote from her, I don't like any of Mer's art because
00:09:39 all of the characters are white, okay, they're what, oh, I think if I were to change nothing,
00:09:47 have everything be the same, but all of the characters were any other demographic other
00:09:53 than white, perfectly fine, it was a kind of empowering image, but no, would they be happy
00:10:01 so we need more women of color deforesting the Amazon rainforest, what I'm thinking is,
00:10:10 like would they be happy if it was an all black picture, like do they specifically want it to
00:10:15 be diverse, like is it only a problem because they're white? you know what this sounds like to
00:10:20 me is that this person was upset for reasons they couldn't understand and like they just
00:10:26 tried to think and they had to like reverse engineer their own upsetness, that sounds like
00:10:31 Tumblr, yeah, like what is it, what is it that bothers me, what is it that bothers me, uh white,
00:10:38 okay, yeah, what you should like when I look at the the the collage of art and it's it's fascinating
00:10:45 to me that there is so much like consistency and through line in the tonality of them between all
00:10:50 these different artists, but like it's it's like it's so specific that when I see it I think well
00:10:57 obviously this is something that one person cares about more than anything in the universe
00:11:01 and having heard you talk about it that is absolutely true, so like I think that's why
00:11:07 people are fascinated with it is that like I don't know I wish I had that single-minded
00:11:12 devotion to anything, you know, you would think if they were any other demographic other than
00:11:18 white it would be worse because anybody who's ever watched 12 years of slave or django or that one
00:11:25 episode of the boondocks you would think black women looking like how they were as like fucking
00:11:31 home masters from like the civil war era they would think that'd be even worse but not you got
00:11:37 this one tumblr user it's like why the fuck are they all white this is terrible it is problematic
00:11:44 it makes that really okay okay but like these these characters they're like they're villains
00:11:50 like you're you're depicting them as as the villain right yes so this yeah okay this is the one
00:11:56 I'm probably keep having with tumblr is that tumblr can differentiate the difference between what is
00:12:02 reality and what is not reality this is a fictional picture it can't be real but they treat it like
00:12:09 it's real and then react like real which is ridiculous yeah sure I'm curious Mer like do you
00:12:16 want it to be real like if they're really what okay so you would not want to date a crazy blonde
00:12:22 shit cutting down trees without with a hang on I didn't say that I said I didn't want to be real
00:12:28 okay for real I'd be open to the idea however what makes this so compelling is the fact that it's
00:12:35 not real I'm like yeah I think I understand of Ricardo Lopez I like things that are not real
00:12:43 versus Ricardo Lopez being the guy who wanted something to be real so badly he went to great
00:12:48 extremes to make it real and for people who don't heard Ricardo Lopez okay Ricardo Lopez was the
00:12:54 Bjork stalker he was the man who tried to fucking put an AIDS bomb in the mail and try to send it
00:12:59 to Bjork okay okay okay okay so it's not it's not like you actually like wish for the destruction
00:13:08 of forests but yeah yeah but something I really feel like I'm on the same wavelength I get it with
00:13:17 this sort of stuff because I am also I'm also like a great lover of the terrible evil bitch lady
00:13:26 characters in a lot of media she's most enticing you know anybody who's ever like golden boy no
00:13:34 man madame president makes my cock so hard it's oh golden boy I love golden boy my best friend he
00:13:41 fucking loves that he keeps telling me to get that to watch it I haven't watched it yet but I know who
00:13:45 madame president is because that's his wife I watch golden boy when I think I was probably a little
00:13:50 too young to appreciate it uh all I got out of it was that the main character was like the coolest
00:13:56 guy ever it's almost like embarrassing how he's like oh wow he's so cool he can literally do anything
00:14:00 he's like oh what a what a badass uh uh but yeah yeah yeah you're simped because you got that scene
00:14:06 where madame president just spits in his mouth super erect he's he's he's like he's like a horny
00:14:13 idiot but he's like he like there's only six episodes I think but like every episode ends with
00:14:18 him like pulling turning the situation around in some like unbelievably like ridiculous display of
00:14:24 competence like there's I think there's an episode where he gets hired by some like software firm
00:14:28 and then like everyone like the the the the madame president or whatever of the software firm like
00:14:34 abuses him and shit and then he like he runs away in the middle of the night but before he leaves
00:14:38 he spends like one night and he like reprograms their entire database and like overhauls all
00:14:42 their like computer like company software and shit and just like remakes it from scratch
00:14:46 and it's just the best fucking software anyone's ever seen uh there's another bit in that one
00:14:53 episode where he pretends like he's playing on a computer so he draws a piece of paper that looks
00:14:57 like a keyboard and he's just furiously typing on that piece of paper he's like yes even when
00:15:03 you're not shitposting your need to shitpost consumes you so so you you were you were telling me
00:15:11 the other day or I was talking to um um wait uh uh okay I want to I want to give a shout out to uh to
00:15:18 pyro from the podcast shreddit uh uh who who is the one who who's the one who like uh said that he
00:15:25 knew you and gave me the hookup and gave you my contact info to get you on here and stuff thanks
00:15:29 thanks pyro go check out shreddit everybody yes so we talk frequently in fact he even sent me a text
00:15:34 message the other day asking like you still going on that podcast I'm like I wouldn't not you really
00:15:38 wanted me to talk to this dude but but he was he was I was confused because I was because I was
00:15:44 talking to him and he described like like your commissions and stuff as shitposts and you're
00:15:49 describing them as shitposts I mean so I thought okay so it's a bit so it's a bit a lot of things
00:15:56 one it's porn two it's for shitposting and three it's for you know spreading my brand around you
00:16:02 know because I like to I like to make shitposting interesting you know we're we're at a point 2020
00:16:08 has made me realize that you know people who moderate all these big names social media sites
00:16:14 like reddit and fortune you know we call them the janitors because they do it for free you know
00:16:19 they're yeah we're all tired of shitposting they they don't like it they want everything to be like
00:16:24 in this contained little box where everything is no fun allowed and if there are any people
00:16:29 having fun at any time you're done you can't have any fun anywhere at any time that's why I've
00:16:35 been banned practically everywhere now the only places I haven't been banned from now are twitter
00:16:41 and discord and that's half the reason why I want to go back on the dick show because I want to feed
00:16:47 into dick's point about how we're becoming more and more Orwellian by the day because the US
00:16:52 government literally cannot fucking help themselves ever since shelter in place the government has
00:16:58 been forming a massive fucking stiffy in their pants finally getting to have their Orwellian
00:17:04 wet dream come true and they're so close but can you can you elaborate interrupting that it's pissing
00:17:11 them off can you can you elaborate on the Orwellian state all right so how about just the concept of
00:17:18 shadow banning in general like if you ban someone you know they can't go back for a couple of days
00:17:23 if you ip ban someone you're done like you know unless you have some ip like like altering software
00:17:29 like Nord VPN like you're essentially done but I'm guessing like hard crack down on ip banning
00:17:35 they have shadow banning now where they'll give you the freedom to keep shitposting but the problem is
00:17:42 only you can see nobody sees it that only only you can see it but that's but that's not the government
00:17:49 oh hear me out there's a point to this so yeah what makes shadow banning really shitty is that
00:17:54 you go through all that shitposting and nobody can see it and you're thinking yourself is like
00:18:00 how the hell do we get to this have any of you ever heard of a guy named mr. anti bully mediocre
00:18:09 medicare yeah i know i know who that is so before medicare basically just disappeared off the face
00:18:15 of the internet he got cancer yeah he got cancer like he basically just moved out of existence so
00:18:24 he made a video and he was talking about how a lot of dumb shit has happened since the 2016
00:18:31 elections obviously or at least to the perception of everybody a person that the establishment
00:18:38 wanted to win did not win and they were dumbfounded as to how this happened so they had to call a
00:18:43 spade a spade and kind of alter things accordingly now during this process mediocre goes and releases
00:18:50 this video and he's talking about how google and all these big tech companies are very upset
00:18:59 that the narrative that they want is not the narrative that they're getting or have gotten
00:19:03 close to getting because people keep shifting away from their perspectives and their points of
00:19:09 you want they can't control people unless they control the narrative so medicare goes and says
00:19:16 they're hoarding you what they're doing is that they're going to work all these people who are
00:19:20 experiencing wrong thing and they're going to put them in a box and they're going to put them in a
00:19:25 box where the only people who can hear them are the people who are in that box or even worse the only
00:19:31 people who can hear them are themselves and an example of that would be poll poll is a great
00:19:38 alternate place to find people who can give you alternate means to look for news that isn't
00:19:43 completely biased like cnn or msnbc or all of these circumstances where the situation
00:19:51 the question seems very sketch and questionable and all the material given doesn't look like it's
00:19:57 legitimate it looks like it's being altered and twisted to form a narrative and he warns all these
00:20:02 people it's like eventually it's going to get to the point where the establishment is going to get
00:20:06 so sick of people shitposting and saying anything that people don't like that they're going to
00:20:11 rope them all into a box and then keep them into that quarantine area and they can have all the
00:20:15 wrong thing they want as long as it's not being put in the place that we don't want wrong thing to
00:20:19 think shadow banning is a normalization of that you notice how because i'll mention tumblr again
00:20:25 i mean i definitely think that twitter in particular is a like an extremely managed
00:20:31 like platform in terms of the narrative that the that the platform itself is trying to push
00:20:37 based on who pays them which seems to be like the more democratic leaning side of the
00:20:45 media establishment just based on the fact that when you make new twitter accounts like
00:20:49 all the stuff it pushes to you is just like like the the catalog of all the you know the
00:20:56 ellen and all the famous people the that weird category of the people who get pushed by the
00:21:01 media you know what i'm talking about yeah like uh the same people who are who youtube is always
00:21:06 showing in your face and um it's fascinating because it's not that there isn't a huge presence
00:21:13 of like the exact opposite opinions and everything going on on twitter but there is a like an effort
00:21:21 in the part of the algorithm to push the like a a i don't want to say left wing because it's like
00:21:28 what's the word i'm looking for just democrat i guess like it's just like push biden to president
00:21:33 currently is like what the like when you look at what the sidebar is on twitter it's like
00:21:38 it's it's not representative of what is being tweeted about it's representative of like what
00:21:44 twitter wants you to think is happening today you know i i mean sure is that i mean is that like
00:21:51 i don't know i for all i know twitter could be like a big like neoliberal chill or whatever could
00:21:56 be like all about biden maybe jack is like su just thinks like cop mommy cop malla is really
00:22:01 hot i don't fucking know um i think they just get money from there because like twitter twitter
00:22:06 doesn't make twitter makes no money like twitter doesn't they keep increasing the amount of ad
00:22:12 shit on there and now they're doing fleets to i don't know get people to use it more i don't
00:22:17 know how that even pushes ads but like the like twitter was making like less and less money year
00:22:23 after year and i have to assume that it's more powerful as for its ability to inform or like
00:22:31 create narratives in society like so much of what is taken very seriously on twitter as like
00:22:37 things happening that matter a whole lot don't seem to really when you actually go outside and
00:22:43 like look at what's happening sometimes you know i mean like of course like i mean the huge swaths
00:22:49 of twitter are owned by like bts stands and and and stuff like that like yeah of course everything
00:22:54 that's important on twitter isn't important in the real world most things on the internet don't
00:22:58 matter in the right but a lot of it looks like it does things are super important on twitter for
00:23:02 like one day and then everyone forgets about them but they they affect the way that people yeah
00:23:08 they affect people's like the way that people compound their narrative about their personal
00:23:13 politics you know like i think that i think it is being used like the the idea of like putting
00:23:21 some of like obviously twitter doesn't want to kick republicans off of its platform that would be
00:23:26 preposterous that would be a lot of the population but it's it's not that they're like even necessarily
00:23:32 suppressing them or making it impossible for them to communicate with each other or link or anything
00:23:37 like that like if i follow a bunch of accounts of one type i'm going to get recommended everybody
00:23:43 who those people follow because it's based on who they follow not based on what they say or what they
00:23:48 do but twitter does shadow categorize you like they there's you know proof of this idea that like
00:23:56 they have all these tags that they put on like users or posts who have been flagged for like
00:24:00 saying certain things and like they do put you in boxes they do try to like if they identify you
00:24:07 as somebody who they don't want to have their voice out there right and it's not even that it's a
00:24:14 right versus left thing it's just whatever twitter wants the their whatever they're in service of
00:24:20 i don't know who's at the heart of i mean that's i'm sure that i'm sure this is true i'm sure that's
00:24:24 true this is um this is just this is what happens when uh when a company when a company has a monopoly
00:24:30 on a certain kind of information yeah of course they're gonna use that that's a great yo uh ben
00:24:36 yeah let me add to your point there when you mentioned how a company is using money to enforce
00:24:42 that agenda do you remember a while ago when basically the entire world had like the biggest
00:24:47 thermonuclear shit that possible because somebody some fucking pageete or whatever working at the
00:24:54 white house was pushing for that means or um you know just it doesn't really matter just some
00:25:00 fucker who wanted to push the fc or not the fcc the uh the net neutrality thing and people were
00:25:07 complaining non-stop about how they were worried with this net neutrality bill that the internet was
00:25:15 going to focus more on biting by the whims of what corporations want versus what the natural user would
00:25:22 want like there were all these like reports about people talking about how like if you want to go on
00:25:28 a site that the internet doesn't want you to see like you know they'll let you go on it but they'll
00:25:32 make it a pain in the ass for you to one find the site in the algorithm and two like it'll take way
00:25:38 too long for you to actually get on the site versus how it's yeah i remember about net i remember
00:25:45 the thing about net neutrality yeah that's basically what you're talking about they were trying to make
00:25:49 it seem like you know unless you're like a billionaire or you have like a lot of money to spend
00:25:53 on like ads and all that shit they were going to make the internet more convenient for them and
00:25:57 inconvenient for everybody else you know because they can't financially compete with that that's
00:26:01 namely what you're talking about yeah well yeah i mean but yeah the goal was to make it possible
00:26:07 for for uh you know certain certain groups and individuals certain companies to you know further
00:26:13 monopolize the internet because because right because net neutrality right now means that
00:26:18 everyone that uses i'm not an expert but my understanding is that it means that everybody
00:26:22 gets access to the same bandwidth versus if we remove net neutrality then like twitter or
00:26:27 facebook or whatever couldn't could basically buy access to the good internet and everyone else would
00:26:32 be left with you know the the scraps of bandwidth that were left over nothing vile how could anybody
00:26:38 fucking not see that as like just man just let me have my orwellian wet dream i'm about to
00:26:43 i'm so sick of edging i want it now i want to be like china it's obviously it's obviously bad
00:26:49 and evil but because but because politics are controlled by money and money to interests you
00:26:54 know it can still make it to the highest court in the land or whatever obviously i'm not saying
00:26:59 people with power like well they've they've lied in their bed they know what they want they they
00:27:03 know what they're doing mm-hmm and it's it's fucking awful i hate it so much sure sure um
00:27:11 okay i don't even remember what the question was that let us down this this this avenue
00:27:17 i've been looking at pacifika northwest she's one of my favorites who pacifika northwest
00:27:22 from gravity falls the one of two characters that i remember oh yeah yeah yeah oh right blonde
00:27:29 sure okay cool i i like these images they're they they they speak to me i think like that
00:27:37 you were saying it was a shitpost but it was also kind of a real thing i think the quantity
00:27:42 of it is the shitpost like the fact that you've done so many of them
00:27:46 and all of them were made by me like it it was like the opposite of like when wendy got popular
00:27:52 as a character and like way in like a fucking boatload of like ad traffic because people kept
00:27:58 drawing porn of their mascot and they couldn't have been happier because people were going to
00:28:01 wendy's more often oh oh i think you went wendy from um gravity falls no no no yeah okay i knew
00:28:09 what he meant um when wait okay i just want to can you how how long have you been doing this
00:28:15 how many images do you think you've commissioned how many like how many do you do in a month like
00:28:19 how much do you and how much have you spent on this versus like how much do you spend in a month
00:28:23 well then i should specify the fetish itself started when i was three years old but the
00:28:27 commission started around 2012 can you tell us about how the fetish started so uh one of you
00:28:35 has been on the the dick show so you already know this story but for the sake of repeating it
00:28:40 yeah for our audience's benefit when when i went on the dick show i was talking about how um i was
00:28:46 watching uh dexter's laboratory one day and an episode showed up and it was basically the start
00:28:52 of how my uh destruction fetish essentially came to be um so the episode was called the old
00:28:59 switcher rooms it's about how dexter's dad came back from a bowling tournament he got first prize
00:29:05 for being the best bowler out of everybody there and when didi and dexter are running around in the
00:29:10 hallway you know just being stupid kids they knock over the trophy and they break the trophy
00:29:14 and dexter's dad gets really really mad instead of crap i do remember this yeah instead of uh
00:29:21 instead of grounding both his kids he turns them it's like you know what i've got a more creative
00:29:25 idea for punishment since you both broke my trophy dexter you're gonna be spending the rest of the
00:29:30 night in didi's room and didi you're gonna be spending the rest of the night in dexter's room
00:29:35 and dexter if you leave didi's room at all anytime throughout the night you're sleeping in the dog
00:29:42 house and the dog is gonna go sleep in your room so what the so dexter is who would sleep in didi's
00:29:51 room that would mean that if wait that would mean that if didi can somehow get dexter to leave
00:29:55 her room then the dog goes to dexter's room and by default didi would go back to her room so i
00:30:01 could see mind games developing out of this so i would think i would think that dexter would
00:30:06 rather have the dog in the lab the didi who he thinks is going to destroy it absolutely well
00:30:12 not not the lab his room because you the there's secret access to the lab but i don't didi might
00:30:17 know how to access the lab from his room in fact and she definitely does which book it is to open up
00:30:23 the the fucking bookshelf but dexter's sitting in didi's room he's having a panic attack he's
00:30:28 envisioning like all the horrible things didi could be doing to his fucking lab right now
00:30:33 and anytime he hears a strange noise he presumes that it's didi destroying his lab in the other
00:30:38 room like he hears like a fucking clock going in didi's room and he just presumes did's didi
00:30:44 like taking a sledgehammer and just destroying everything inside because there's like nothing
00:30:49 stopping her from just wrecking everything but these little mental hypotheticals that dexter
00:30:55 is having like all the horrible things didi's probably do into his lab that's how it started
00:30:59 i just got so uncomfortably aroused at how this horrific trail of three i just like oh yeah i've
00:31:08 impressed by your ability to recognize arousal at age three yep that's how it started i i don't i
00:31:15 don't get it but what what i guess why should i expect to um okay yeah okay so all right so then
00:31:22 maybe it's too much to put it in for me i feel like he's he's been spending too much time at
00:31:26 catholic school it's like oh the world is covered in skin right now i don't understand what's hot
00:31:31 about his thoughts that someone is breaking your shit and you know is it like the powerlessness
00:31:37 it's i think right oh it's the someone else is is like taking over like um so would you describe
00:31:45 the entire world is like it's just a massive but in a strange way like the winds get crossed
00:31:50 and scary things become really and holding in quiet missionary for the purpose of procreation
00:31:55 i don't understand what you're describing is not like filthy it's just it's just baffling
00:32:01 very logic would you consider the same would you consider this a masochistic fetish on your
00:32:06 part yes definitely okay okay sure like as i can i can recognize the world to be destroyed
00:32:15 seeing the world be destroyed by hot ladies like oh oh no but also i get it i get it so if it's
00:32:23 deforestation it's like it's it's not just it's not like just your shit that's it's our it's our
00:32:28 it's all of humanity's shit being destroyed it's like she's all of humanity out of what should be
00:32:33 our ours natural resources try to explain this is like does he just have a fetish for karen's
00:32:39 and i laughed for like five minutes when someone recommended that i i think i think a part of it
00:32:47 is so as as speaking as a masochist um like it's part of the you know you it's like you
00:32:57 like like you said well given said like there's a helplessness aspect right like you want to be
00:33:02 like in a position of um i have i don't have to have control in of the situation because it's
00:33:10 i can't you know um and so like as a as a woman it's very easy to achieve this by just having
00:33:18 a man who's bigger than you you know like hold you down but like as a guy how does a woman have
00:33:26 any kind of like power over you like she can't you know unless she's stronger than you
00:33:32 she cannot physically overpower you which is you know most women are not stronger than most men
00:33:39 but they can dominate your wallet and fuck up your life by like spending all your money and
00:33:47 fucking um destroying the world all the trees yeah okay where does this make sense to you
00:33:55 does this seem like it could be accurate in any way as i'm nervous i can feel him depleting
00:34:00 an energy i understand do you think the um do you think the wonderbread aspect is also like a
00:34:06 like a power dynamic because it's like oh mom goes and gets the wonderbread when she's shopping
00:34:12 and like you're almost on target but there's actually another story in relation to that and
00:34:19 i don't know if anybody's heard this unless you've been on the dick show and more than happy to
00:34:22 share that story with you yeah please so you know if ben isn't had a stroke right now he might after
00:34:29 this you you are miss you are mischaracterizing me very much right now but go go on all right so
00:34:37 a long time ago when i was say around 18 i was looking for my first job and i had no
00:34:45 resume experience whatsoever um i went over to a place called pedaluma people services center
00:34:52 all the way up in pedaluma and uh the organization that i'm talking about is kind of like one half
00:35:00 psychiatric place one half uh unemployment office so i went over there and nice it's a good
00:35:07 combo it helps people learn about their feelings and then get back up on their feet and um over
00:35:14 there and i'm asking my therapist it's like yo i really need to get a job i need to start making
00:35:19 some money and um she recommended me this place called bounty farm which is located right next to
00:35:25 the luckiest in the police station up in pedaluma so i had to get up at five o'clock every day and i
00:35:34 had to fucking get on a city bus and then take that city bus to the bus stop and then go from the bus
00:35:40 stop to the county bus and then take that county bus all the way to pedaluma and i had to then be
00:35:47 there by eight o'clock every day and i had to do this for three years it was exhausting but it was
00:35:53 my first job i'm working on a farm how old how old were you how old were you 18 okay yeah so i'm
00:36:00 there and right now as of then i was the only person working there and i go to my boss i'm like
00:36:07 am i the only employee working here it's like not the only employee we're gonna be getting another
00:36:11 employee you also showed up the day after you did she'll be showing up soon so she shows up
00:36:16 and we get to talking and after a while this person ended up becoming my girlfriend and it
00:36:22 didn't last but the process wasn't like just instantaneous boom you're my girlfriend now
00:36:28 it was a long long long process you know like anybody who's ever watched like any of those
00:36:34 really shitty soapy opera kind of shows like 90210 or and any of any of those kind of shows like
00:36:42 you know it was the build to that you know it's like we had to we had to have a long lasting
00:36:46 friendship a bunch of dumb shit involving other relationship shit had to happen and eventually
00:36:51 she just turned to me and she was like you want a shot like you want to be my boyfriend see what
00:36:57 it's like i'm like i'm more than willing to try and we were in a relationship well i should say we
00:37:03 were in a friendship for years but our actual relationship serious relationship lasted two
00:37:11 days and it was two days of my life that two days felt like two years so that's the funniest
00:37:20 shit i ever heard yeah so we're we're going on our first date and i have this all planned out
00:37:27 first we're gonna go get uh chinese food so we went to this old place that doesn't exist anymore
00:37:32 called gary chews and we go there and that's is that like is that like a sonichu like uh
00:37:39 original character obviously christian came out to win her up it's like may i recommend the
00:37:44 gary chew yeah so we go to gary chews and it's already not going the way i wanted to go she's
00:37:52 talking about how she wants to get drunk and i'm like it's like one o'clock in the afternoon
00:37:58 you're talking about wanting to get blitzed so were you guys even old enough to drink i'm i wasn't
00:38:04 old enough to drink but like she was 21 when i met her so i mean she's 21 so i see we go to gary
00:38:12 chews we have our food she wants to drink and then i then skip to the next part of the date which is
00:38:19 where we went to go see a movie we went to go see this is making me want to drink so we go to the
00:38:25 movie theater we see mad max fury road and after we're done with the movie she oh great movie oh great
00:38:31 great film classic film yeah so after the movie is done she wants to go home and she really wants
00:38:40 to drink so we get on the bus and we're going on our way home and here's the problem before this
00:38:50 i actually met a person i used to live with and i'm not gonna obviously give this man name because
00:38:56 you know i'm not an asshole but just to really give you an idea as to what this person was like
00:39:01 i found him drunk in like the bus stop one day and apparently he had mid-court order or whatever
00:39:07 and we were talking or whatever and then he turned to me it's like hey oh that girl i saw you hanging
00:39:13 out with i fucked her i fucked her last night and i fucked her real good by the way do you know
00:39:20 anybody i can fight right now because i really want to fight someone this dude was drunk okay and he
00:39:25 just straight up told me that he fucked my girlfriend and wait wait wait wait wait wait
00:39:29 sorry sorry this was okay this two-day relationship you're saying on the second day of those two days
00:39:35 you found this guy and he said i fucked that girl you went out with last night the day before the
00:39:40 date started i ran into this guy i used to live with okay i think this guy for three years because
00:39:46 i used to be a foster kid we used to live in a foster home together he i i want to nail down
00:39:52 the order of events so this is the day before she became your girlfriend he said i fucked that girl
00:39:58 yeah the day before she became my girlfriend this dude i lived with all my life and the
00:40:02 foster home that we lived in turned to me said i fucked your girlfriend so yes we're on the
00:40:06 bus right home and then and then the next day you were like hey she was like hey be my boyfriend
00:40:11 and you were like okay let's go out and get chinese yeah so okay on the bus right home yeah i know i
00:40:17 know what you're thinking you know i i don't know what i'm thinking i'm not sure but before we get to
00:40:23 that she was like no it's not cocked you that's okay okay go on go on we're on the bus we're on our
00:40:30 way to runner park which is where she lived at the time she doesn't live in runner park anymore
00:40:33 because it's too expensive to live there but when she was living in runner park we're both on the bus
00:40:39 i turned to her and i asked her did you fuck that guy and she gets really defensive about it
00:40:46 and she said no i did not fuck that guy but then after like 10 minutes of silence she gets really
00:40:52 embarrassed she turns to me and said yeah fuck that guy the day before i asked if you wanted to be
00:40:58 my boyfriend we went and had sex and i just told him to leave so wow okay so he was telling me the
00:41:04 whole truth yeah she admitted to it and this is where it gets really depressing really fast so
00:41:11 when we get off the bus the first thing we do is we go into safeway and she buys two 12 packs of
00:41:17 IPA log and eat a beer and if any of you have ever drank an IPA it is the shittiest beer ever you
00:41:25 know is it i don't know if that's i think that's a controversial opinion IPA's are a a new gate
00:41:33 for sure they're they're sort of like uh it's like the dark souls of beer the dark souls of beer you
00:41:39 know i no i drink fucking miller light i drink i drink fucking natty ice like i drink like piss
00:41:45 beer and i don't give a fuck natty ice you might as well yeah no yeah i i do i'll drink the worst
00:41:54 beer in the world i don't care but okay sure you get all the IPA and we're going back to her apartment
00:42:00 and i'm thinking to myself it's like man you know this is not going the way i hope it do but i'm
00:42:04 hoping at the end of the night we can somehow fix this so we go there she cracks open an IPA and
00:42:09 she cracks open another IPA for me and then she throws it over to me and wants me to start drinking
00:42:14 let me ask you how did you feel when she said yes i fucked that guy were you mad did you feel
00:42:19 sad were you jealous complex assortment of different emotions between what the fuck and why
00:42:26 so yeah she passes me an IPA and i take one sip and i immediately spit it out i'm like this tastes
00:42:34 horrible how do you drink this so two of her friends show up and they come on in girls
00:42:44 no uh well one of them was a girl one of them was a boy these are just people that she knew
00:42:50 and uh yeah one of them pulls out a deck of cards against humanity cards and no no
00:42:57 no oh this is the worst part so i'm sitting down at a table and the good times are over
00:43:06 she's flipping out cards against humanity cards like they're fucking poker cards and i
00:43:10 just fucking shoot me yeah so let me tell you cards against humanity is the most
00:43:17 overrated game i've ever played in my life i feel like the only reason why this game exists
00:43:23 is because if you're really politically correct like i'm talking really politically correct like
00:43:29 the very idea of anybody even like hinting at saying the n-word pisses you off the only reason
00:43:35 why they play this game is because they can have one instance where they don't have to be politically
00:43:39 correct but it's i have a yeah but it's the only time ever you get to feel that way and when you
00:43:45 take that away this game sucks this game is boring it's i don't know why people think this is the
00:43:52 greatest game in the world the the jokes the jokes in in cards against humanity or have already
00:43:59 you're not making jokes when you combine cards like the designers made those cards and made those
00:44:05 with those combinations in mind already like you're not even like being creative you're just
00:44:09 like matching things that like the designers put there because they thought it would be funny
00:44:14 this is the first time i've ever played cards against humanity and when i finally get the
00:44:17 bare basics down the first thing that goes into my mind is that's it this is all we're doing yeah
00:44:23 who fucking care about a game like this people just want to say naughty words it's the only
00:44:28 reason why they're playing this game yeah yeah yeah and ridiculous like there's no enjoyment out of
00:44:33 this game again even though what little enjoyment you can get out of this game it's boring i'd rather
00:44:38 be doing literally anything else right now other than playing cards against humanity so she's passing
00:44:42 out IPAs she's flipping out these cards against humanity cards after like 10 minutes of this i'm
00:44:49 like i don't want to play anymore like my date is already ruined i couldn't like you know i just
00:44:55 wanted to go out to get chinese food i wanted to go out and see a movie and i just wanted to have a
00:45:00 quiet night with her i instead have her complaining about how she wants to go get drunk and then when
00:45:06 she leaves the movie she wants to go get really drunk go to see if we can get a bunch of things to
00:45:10 help her get drunk we go to her house and you know her eventually her friends just finally leave but
00:45:18 like you know go in and her room has one futon now this is not like a king-size alaskan bed no
00:45:28 it's like a regular futon it's like the kind of futon you see in those slice of life japanese
00:45:34 anime's where it's an apartment for one you sleep on a futon this is what you sleep on this futon was
00:45:40 very clearly made for her body type because it perfectly fits how proportional she is to the
00:45:49 so she goes and gets a small tube tv and a dvd player and what she does is she grabs a random
00:45:59 movie off of her dvd case and the movie she grabs is howl's moving castle and she puts
00:46:07 howl's moving castle in the dvd player and starts playing the movie now you've heard of netflix and
00:46:12 chill right i assume that's what we're trying to yeah we don't have netflix so in order to stimulate
00:46:22 netflix and chill she grabbed the dvd put it in and just put it on his ambient noise that's just
00:46:27 what we did before netflix like you know it was move movie and chill yeah so she pops in howl's
00:46:34 moving castle which is her favorite movie next to princess mononoke so yeah so she puts this
00:46:43 movie in and she wants to have me cuddle her on the futon since i mentioned before that this
00:46:50 futon is clearly only made for one person imagine my fat fucking frame pushing this scrawny girl
00:46:59 off of her futon so i am like back first against the wall like in a lying down form i'm almost like
00:47:06 in a fetal position and my back is essentially touching the wall because i want to have her have
00:47:12 enough room on her futon so we can cuddle but if i eat up too much room for what i think is like
00:47:19 proportional for me i'll end up pushing her off the bed so it's impossible for this to be
00:47:26 any less romantic if it tried so she's like all right we're we're gonna make this work
00:47:33 follow me the best you can and i want you to you know touch my breasts and i did right so
00:47:44 of course this was the first yeah this was the first time ever describe the can situation
00:47:52 what oh sure tits like did they feel like wonder bread is this where this has been
00:47:58 leading this is where the story is the entire time all this build up i touched this is the
00:48:03 worst story i've ever heard about this this is even this is even this is even worse than jesse's
00:48:07 how i lost my virginity story this was the longest the most pointless story i've ever heard the funny
00:48:11 thing is i knew what the ending was at the start and i just wanted to see how long the story could
00:48:18 possibly go and if i hate this relevant to the i hate it all for the first time this is the first
00:48:24 time ever i touched a woman's breasts they felt really soft and i'm thinking to myself what is the
00:48:30 only thing i could think of that would represent what a woman's breasts feel like i'm thinking i'm
00:48:36 thinking i'm thinking and the only thing that possibly why were you why were you thinking about
00:48:40 that just touch the the boob yeah i touched breasts before i'm thinking what am i thinking of when i
00:48:46 think of this texture bread it's it's it's the uh this is why this is why you got dumped this is
00:48:52 why you got dumped do you think too much did you say that out loud you say oh you you have a very
00:48:57 like bread like breast no i didn't say that to her but i thought about it after she told me to leave
00:49:04 the following day so okay i want okay okay so you touched the boobs and was that it no there is
00:49:13 more to that but it's a bit more nsfw and uh so did you so did you fuck uh so before that
00:49:22 just yes or no just yes or no did you fuck or not we did well but it wasn't like the way you
00:49:28 thought like she wrote a list and on that list was things that she said she would be open to
00:49:34 doing i think she wouldn't be open to doing when i asked her when i asked her all right what's your
00:49:40 opinion of giving someone a bj and her opinion of that was you only ever give bj's to people if
00:49:46 they do something rewarding like they got a promotion at work they got an a plus that's
00:49:49 horseshit yeah but that's how it's your opinion of anal and she's like no i hate it only catholic
00:49:56 schoolgirls do that shit it's painful i got her okay okay so okay all right i asked her all right
00:50:03 so she's like touch my breasts and i touch your breasts and they feel like wonder bread
00:50:08 then she's like all right let's try kissing i really enjoyed this part but the problem is
00:50:15 again like touching someone's breasts i've never kissed before so our tongues our tongues are touching
00:50:22 and then after like 10 seconds she pushed him back it's like have you never kissed anyone other
00:50:26 than your mother before i'm like no this girl seems like kind of a bitch so um yeah for real
00:50:33 so she gets up and she's like all right i need to be perfectly real with you
00:50:38 i've done this so many times with multitude of different men so i just kind of know right now
00:50:45 are you a virgin i'm like you're my first and she just turned her face against the wall she
00:50:52 lied down and she was quiet for the rest of the night i woke up at six in the morning she told
00:50:58 me to leave yeah so you didn't see you didn't fuck you said you fucked you didn't fuck it started
00:51:06 that way okay go on then what happened next she woke me up at six and she told me to leave
00:51:14 you said you fucked yeah you said you fucked yeah we did when when when in that story did you
00:51:19 fuck right in the middle of the kissing part were you not paying attention no i wasn't paying attention
00:51:26 i don't whole story okay i guess i okay i guess i missed that part okay you like fuck we made a
00:51:32 long way wait so you how did i miss it you must have skipped over it in like no time at all
00:51:38 you you asked me this story about where does the bread come from i told you that's how it started
00:51:44 my first sexual encounter am i crazy did he just like completely gloss over the part where they had sex
00:51:51 i don't remember you describing that you had sex remember you saying that's not important that's
00:51:57 not that's what i asked i wanted to know if you fuck yeah we did but that's not important you're
00:52:03 overthinking it the point of this story is where it started all right okay that's fair enough
00:52:11 okay so you how long how long ago was that and then she realized that you know they they
00:52:17 fucked while they were kissing i think yes there you go now you're getting it but all right
00:52:24 like you you all act like you know it's like a long process it's not a long process it's different
00:52:29 for each person okay um mirlog how long ago was this that you made this wonderbread discovery
00:52:37 six years ago but like that was only when i wanted to start making commissions of it i've had this
00:52:42 fetish since i was three years old wait stop well not the wait not the wonder you said the
00:52:48 wonderbread thing happened when this when you were 18 yes but it's not just wonderbread it's
00:52:54 wonderbread deforestation and destruction this fetish happened when i was three it only started
00:53:00 okay into what you see now when i started making commissions okay well i guess i guess what i'm
00:53:06 trying to understand is how long after discovering that boobs feel like wonderbread did you start
00:53:11 commissioning art of wonderbread specifically that's six years but six years between those two things
00:53:21 yeah so i broke up with my girlfriend and i learned that boobs kind of feel like wonderbread and that
00:53:27 was kind of what started the whole commissioning process so no but okay but how long after that
00:53:33 happened did you did you commission your first work of art oh after that oh yeah first after
00:53:41 i broke up with my girlfriend okay so it's pretty much immediate like had you already been like
00:53:45 regularly commissioning artwork before that yeah i was regularly commissioning artwork but it was
00:53:51 unrelated to wonderbread what was it it was deforestation and destruction i assume
00:53:59 i i'm okay okay so i understand the destruction happened three years old dexter's lab wonderbread
00:54:05 18 years old girlfriend uh when when did when did specifically the deforestation aspect
00:54:11 no i just asked that you know the destruction and deforestation aspect is in the same category
00:54:16 that's been that way okay three isn't it okay wait okay okay but but but the example you said the
00:54:22 dexter's laboratory didn't involve deforestation yeah i feel like like that must have come into it
00:54:27 at a certain point you must have made a jump you there must have been a moment when you made a jump
00:54:30 from oh i like this destruction thing that this oh deforestation is like a particular instance
00:54:35 of that that is particularly compelling and then it moved on to captain planet and then it moved on
00:54:40 to a number of different shows uh i reference guys every part of my life so you would say it spread
00:54:45 would you say that it spread like wildfire through your uh enjoyment of media now you see the
00:54:51 most really bushfire of like 2020 was just a metaphor of what really happened this episode of
00:54:57 dexter's lab was like a lightning bolt that lit the dry brush underneath the dehydrated bog the
00:55:03 peat bogs of something i don't know what is the most you spent on one commission of this
00:55:09 let's see i think of it varies upon artist artists and it varies upon the scale of the project
00:55:14 i once paid 323 dollars for porn of another commission artist's wife
00:55:19 excellent worth it that's funny base um how much okay ballpark me how much have you spent
00:55:32 totally in this the intervening is like six years 4.3 billion dollars per million that's not a real
00:55:39 number my friend exactly because the number is so high i've lost count i guess the better question is
00:55:44 what is it in the four digits five digits it's in the seven digits big rush fortune digits
00:55:53 marologic at what rates would you say that you commission art for this like how often not nearly
00:55:59 to the degree that i would like to because like everybody else during shelter in place i am broke
00:56:04 and so are 50 million other people over the united states right right where do you where do you post
00:56:10 them like like i think you post them around as a shitpost where do you put them i did post
00:56:15 them on dvn art and then i got shadow banned and then i posted them on reddit and then i got shadow
00:56:19 banned and i post them on why did you why did you get shadow banned from dvn art because the janitor
00:56:25 is fucking do it for free and they shit their pants but don't get their way but but what was
00:56:31 but what was the jet okay i don't see anything bannable about just simply posting the images
00:56:36 that you have commissioned but homeboy you don't get it janitors don't do their job
00:56:41 because they want to do their job correctly because it's the only amount of power they get in their
00:56:46 life this is why people i guess yes i think the i think the question that's trying to ask is
00:56:53 where you ban for your uh for your image posting or for text posting like for things i want to
00:56:58 know specifically what was the thing that was like okay this guy's out of here it was both
00:57:03 i made fun of the janitor's waifus and their shit opinions and how they have no idea what the
00:57:07 fuck they're doing and they're unforeseen wait what you made fun of the you made fun of the mod's
00:57:13 wife no no i didn't make fun of their other wives they're waifus they're 2d images oh you're making
00:57:26 fun of the of a mod's waifu yeah and i don't know who who was wait who was it who was the waifu
00:57:32 who fucking cares there's probably some shit waifu i don't i'm just okay fine what did you say
00:57:39 tell me how the encounter went that just i did your waifu is shit you have the shittiest
00:57:43 taste in waifus ever hot pockets and asthma puffers you just cannot handle the bants when
00:57:49 you get blown the fuck out you cry and then shit your pants yeah and then you got banned yes
00:57:56 and it's basically the story how i get shadow banned on basically everywhere i'm banned on tumblr
00:58:01 reddit dvnart and specifically target mods that's why you get banned is that you
00:58:09 i'm not targeting mods on purpose they instigate this and then it leads to me getting banned
00:58:16 i'm not looking for mods they're looking for me that's the problem well now that you've
00:58:21 got a reputation i can kind of understand how they would at least find you so that make that part
00:58:26 makes sense fucking june it's good for free they do see i yeah i would i would be confused because
00:58:35 all of these images they're like a strange fetish and it's funny that there's so many of them but
00:58:40 like there's nothing offensive about them so like yeah it wouldn't it wouldn't be a reason for any
00:58:45 social media sites are getting to the point where they just want everything to be a echo chamber
00:58:50 hub box where everything is exactly they want it to be they want control they don't want fun
00:58:55 posture they don't want riveting discussion they want control you know it just occurred to me
00:59:03 i i just i don't know why this is something i never thought of there is definitely people who
00:59:08 would pay you to mod your stuff so so is it so is it the is it the companies that want control
00:59:15 and an echo chamber they're banning you or is it these like individual jannies that do it for free
00:59:20 that are just exercising their individual power it's a bigger symptom of what's wrong with the
00:59:25 internet right now everybody is getting banned for dumb reasons i'm not complaining because i'm the
00:59:31 only one getting banned i'm complaining about how just everywhere it's not even just a reddit it's
00:59:36 everywhere people are getting banned for the dumbest shit because janitors who do it for free
00:59:43 have this in their mind like they're enforcing this new agenda they're being told to enforce
00:59:48 or other people are just going off script because someone made fun of their waifu or something dumb
00:59:53 and they got so fucking asthmat they shot their pants they shot blood and they banned the person
00:59:59 and then he coomed in his pants and he thought he did something productive today that is the janitor
01:00:03 he does it for free gotcha very logic i have to tell you i think you're a marketing genius
01:00:10 the way you hammer on those phrases like that um they do it for free i think they would pay you
01:00:16 to mod for you i think that's imagine if i do get paid i would never i would no i'm not even
01:00:23 saying that they would get paid i'm saying i'm saying that janitors would pay to do the job
01:00:31 like they would pay oh to do it they would they would pay deviant art or discourse or whatever
01:00:36 yeah yeah to be a mod sure i'm sure i think there are people who would complain about being a mod
01:00:41 when that one girl who went on my deviant art complained about the art being all white
01:00:45 she went over to the deviant art mods and she was like don't you think this counts as hate speech
01:00:50 deviant art moderators probably okay okay we're in a sonico season diaper fetish shit
01:00:57 and then they look at my art it's like huh you're right now i'm i'm sure deviant art
01:01:03 always so i'm i'm here i think it's funny now obviously it's funny that she's like all i see is
01:01:09 white people this is hate speech like that's pretty funny but i i'm just curious if that incident
01:01:14 did you reflect on it at all and be like what if i did draw a black you know colonizer a black
01:01:20 deforester yeah what again what was your conclusion that is when i drew princess marco
01:01:25 from star versus who's the only not well technically that's not true i don't even know who that is
01:01:30 pretty long from star versus she's also princess marco princess marco star versus oh okay i see her
01:01:39 her okay her male that is the boy
01:01:44 that's mm-hmm yes it's princess oh marco marco d uh oh it's the oh it's the boy it's the
01:01:52 i've never seen star versus so i don't know who these people are okay all right gotcha gotcha
01:01:58 okay this is uh that's excellent so mere logic that that ties into uh something i was gonna ask you
01:02:05 is at the beginning i was asking if you'd ever paid anybody to like just cosplay and hold bread
01:02:11 and i happen to be planning to dye my hair blonde in about a week so i'm wondering do you would you
01:02:17 business opportunity did you just straight up just push bend to the side it's like all right
01:02:24 off camera real quick this is more like you know more important with me like a payment plan
01:02:30 i gotta i gotta be hard let's let's talk to make some money so i don't i don't even get to i
01:02:40 i'm going to be blonde anyways and i like eating wonder bread so i would have no problem procuring
01:02:45 that um and also this i mean you just introduced me to the fact that there's like a hard to procure
01:02:51 wonder bread in this economy you know it's funny i actually had someone on reddit sitting again
01:02:58 before i got banned and he was like hey i am a transitioning trap if i were to make a sandwich
01:03:04 and eat it would you pay me to eat it i'm like that depends how much you want to ask it's like
01:03:09 if you were to just like give me 10 bucks to like make a sandwich and eat it would you get
01:03:13 turned on and then pay me to do it i'm like hmm i don't know i mean would you do it and in the end
01:03:20 he didn't really do it but he instigated the idea he asked me it's like would i really well i'm
01:03:26 already dug deep into this hole so i might consider it dg probably write down notes right now
01:03:35 yeah i mean whenever you can afford to uh pay for me to cosplay just hit me up
01:03:44 name a price okay i mean i have to i guess i have to take other cosplay picks i have to
01:03:53 develop a portfolio first i guess um i don't really have a portfolio of uh cosplay photos
01:04:03 yeah we'll get there i mean i am an artist i would be up for drawing a funny fucking
01:04:09 deforestation wonderbread commission i could i could preferably because i can't afford any
01:04:15 i that's another half the reason why not not i'm i'm willing to wait i'll play the long game
01:04:23 i'm gonna be blonde for a while so this is gonna be waiting it's like any day now i'm gonna be
01:04:27 making bank if my investment opportunities is actually perfect i did want to ask you if it's
01:04:33 not too much information like how do you afford to pay for all this art like what would what were you
01:04:38 anywhere is able to afford anything right now i'm shelter in place i got one stimulus check
01:04:43 and you know it didn't last like or we're all like on some kind they gave us $1,200 and said
01:04:49 fuck you so did you did you lose your job were you non-essential worker i was already
01:04:54 in need before shelter in place now i'm like a super neat like during shelter in place like
01:04:59 everybody well how are okay well how are you making money as a neat like how how is it different
01:05:05 now than it was then why can you not afford it anymore many different and is you know if i have
01:05:11 money like i get it off like making tab money or i do like various odd jobs because if i need a
01:05:16 commission i'm willing to you know do anything need a commission tab tab money yeah you know
01:05:23 let's say somebody comes to me and they ask me it's like hey oh homie i need a pack of cigarettes
01:05:29 could you get me a pack of cigarettes and then i'll pay you back when i have money i have one guy
01:05:34 right now he owes me 110 bucks and if you were to look at his tab the only things that are on his
01:05:39 tab right now are and i quote pizza rolls pizza rolls chicken nuggets chicken nuggets hot cheetos
01:05:45 hot cheetos snapple snapple 110 why don't what why don't they just buy it at the store broke
01:05:52 they asked me to buy it for them and they pay me back oh wait so do they pay you back more than you
01:05:59 like are you sure do you charge interest um i haven't really implemented an interest tab because
01:06:03 i feel like if you implement interest it only compels people to not wait okay this this doesn't
01:06:08 make any sense how do you have this is not a this is not a money-making scheme no wait this is an
01:06:12 uroboros i'm confused how do you get the money that you spend that ends up on their tab so here's
01:06:21 the thing i'm not like christian where i'm spending money like it's out of style i have money i just don't
01:06:27 spend it like a retard like christ but where does it come from where does it come from just money
01:06:32 i've saved up saved from where i assume you just have a job i assume you had a job in a while i
01:06:43 sure don't have a job during shelter in place sure that's what i was saying you did have a job before
01:06:48 though had a job i've had multiple jobs i'm also you want unemployment since you lost your job due
01:06:54 commissions you should you should apply for unemployment if you lost your job due to the
01:07:00 covid release oh okay all right good i kind of have to everybody is right now like how else
01:07:05 you can afford yeah the government wants to be completely dependent on them right now i don't
01:07:10 know i have i have at least one friend who like lost their job it like couldn't work anymore because
01:07:15 of covid and they were like uh yeah well i guess i just have no money now and i'm like did you apply
01:07:20 for for unemployment you know they have a clause in the cares act that says like if you lost your
01:07:25 job due to covid you're entitled to free money from they're like uh i probably don't qualify
01:07:30 no i'm not going to do it i'm like you're literally just throwing thousands of dollars away
01:07:35 your friend probably just heard about the stimulus check thing i thought why doesn't the government
01:07:39 just on my door i just give me money i just wanted to personally give me money yeah i don't
01:07:45 maybe work of any kind yeah it's i i think probably yeah it's like they are intimidated
01:07:51 by the manner but like it's come on there's like there's like a whole bunch of money that is like
01:07:54 for you you should just like put in the the paperwork to claim it and i know people are
01:08:00 complaining about how societal collapse will happen any day now but literally as of right now
01:08:04 the federal reserve is printing trillions of dollars in money but acting like giving people
01:08:09 a thousand dollars a month is like too much for them to benefit oh the economy can't handle it
01:08:14 you poor people yeah tighten your belt straps a bit more yeah hell yeah austerity boys uh no
01:08:23 they're fucking they're they're fucking bailing out airlines and banks and shit but like oh giving
01:08:27 people money oh how are we gonna pay for it oh how are we gonna pay for it health care hey how are
01:08:31 we gonna pay for it uh no sorry we need to we need to fucking drone strike we need to drone
01:08:35 strike yemen some more sorry we can't afford you to do basic middle-class people not paying enough
01:08:40 taxes for the poor people to not work um were we talking about i don't remember okay i was just
01:08:54 too busy thinking about how that other girl who just like cosplayed as a wonderbread girl
01:09:00 should have gotten like i can't believe she didn't think to ask to get paid i think did you wanted
01:09:06 to know before before shelter in place what did you do for work well the last job i had and this was
01:09:11 before shelter in place this is like a while i've been unemployed for a while i worked at a place
01:09:16 called uh buccaloo unemployment and uh there's a longer story in relation to that but like uh you
01:09:22 worked you worked at an unemployment firm so in my city there are two unemployment firms there is
01:09:29 department of economic rehabilitation and buccaloo they are the two biggest unemployment centers in
01:09:35 the city i needed a job so i went over to dr and i asked my new art coach what is and they gave you
01:09:43 a job at the other one so here's the thing i go over to her and i ask her is there anything i can do
01:09:49 to make some money real quick and she asked me it's like well there is uh catholic charities which is
01:09:55 open catholic charities is a rehabilitation center for runaway kids foster kids and recovering
01:10:03 drug addicts they wanted me to go work over there but they didn't specify what the job was about
01:10:08 over at catholic charities but in order for me to go get that job i had to be trained first so
01:10:14 they send me over to buccaloo and i go over to buccaloo and i'm going through the inauguration
01:10:20 process and the woman is looking over my resume and she looks at me it's like um you are aware that
01:10:27 your california state id is expired right my wait what so i open up my wall i look at my id and i'm
01:10:33 you know holy shit it's expired so she pushes the resume back over to me it's like i'll tell you
01:10:37 what since you seem really enticed at the idea to start working again if you can get that id
01:10:42 renewed i'll give you the job immediately so i went to the dmv i spent three hours in line i got my
01:10:49 fucking id i went back i then asked alright can you start the training process so again i don't
01:10:55 know what kind of job they want me to work over at catholic charities but for whatever reason
01:11:00 they're like having me do random shit like firstly sit me in front of a computer and they
01:11:07 a shit you know they pop up mavis beacon i haven't done mavis beacon since elementary school they
01:11:14 want to check my typing speed i type at 35 words a minute so it then go and decides like actually
01:11:23 you know what you know we need to train you some more before we decide if you want to go work over
01:11:27 at catholic charities so they throw me a broom and a mop and they're like all right until we
01:11:33 feel like you're ready to go work over at catholic charities you're gonna be buckled is janitor
01:11:38 you're gonna you're gonna be a literal janny and you're gonna clean up our messes here's the problem
01:11:45 you would think since it's an office building it's a big building so there's lots to clean
01:11:49 no it is a small building with two rooms and a bathroom when you clean both rooms and the
01:11:57 bathroom you look at the clock and there's seven hours left of the day and you realize that you
01:12:03 now have to find busy work all day in a seven hour work day to pretend like you're doing something
01:12:11 important like when you run out of shit to clean like there's nothing left to clean like that's
01:12:18 right it's so dumb and like this was a problem i was having it's like i'm supposed to be trained
01:12:23 to go over to work at catholic charities right now you're treating me like a janitor like what am i
01:12:28 supposed to be trained for right now and here's what's really shitty my job coach came to me a
01:12:35 couple days later she sat me down it's like mer we're worried that you're not enthusiastic enough
01:12:42 about the job we've given you because it's really hard to be a janitor i mean you're not doing it
01:12:49 with a smile you're not doing it with a smile you fuck yeah fucking wagey why aren't you working
01:12:55 faster why aren't you coming into work every day like a mary poppins character going shitty shitty
01:13:01 bang bang all over the place and i'm just being thrilled that you work a fucking cognitive machine
01:13:07 so eventually my job coach is like all right i'm gonna go to your employer and i'm going to
01:13:14 tell her to motivate you because you don't seem motivated to do this how are you supposed to be
01:13:19 motivated to do this janitorial work is the lowest form of work you can ever put yourself through
01:13:25 nobody other than like people who are desperate and from third world countries because they're
01:13:30 willing to take a pay cut just to come to america just to do work like this because they don't want
01:13:35 to be in mexico anymore and i get sent into my boss's office and they're like i don't know who
01:13:42 trained you last but they did a horrible job and that was an insult because the person who trained
01:13:47 me last is one of my closest friends and the job i worked at before this job was a great job that's
01:13:54 a longer story in its own right but point being i got unbelievably mad i already hated this job i
01:14:01 hated everything about this job so as she's just tearing into my ass right now i just said you know
01:14:07 what to fuck this i called her a piece of shit i called her all kinds of horrible different names
01:14:15 but here's the thing if anybody female sees a male disgruntled employee yelling at their female boss
01:14:24 all the females in the room suddenly become tumblr moderators they all start screaming
01:14:28 yas queen all the same time and the minute they hear me yelling at my boss all of them drop what
01:14:35 they're doing right now they all huddle in a fucking circle around their boss and they're like
01:14:41 you can't do that you're what's the problem with modern day you are a part of the future you can't
01:14:47 yell at your boss i'm like you know what this poor this this poor disenfranchised boss just being
01:14:53 just being just being discriminated against by her wagey employee how dare he yeah how how dare
01:14:59 he uses privilege in this way i got i pushed my chair i got up i took my resume i chucked it into
01:15:06 the air and i just i went over to wing stop and i ate food and then the following day i'm so sorry
01:15:11 wing stop is the worst i'm so sorry man i had a bad day and i went over to wing stop i ate food
01:15:18 and then the following day we then had the tubs fire which lasted for 10 days tubs fire the tubs
01:15:24 fire was one of the worst fires to ever happen in the state of california which is an understatement
01:15:30 considering how we now have terrible fires every year we had five back to back terrible fires this
01:15:37 year during shelter in place yeah yeah i saw the red sky do you see that red sky thing going on up in
01:15:44 like northern cali dude it's it was so bad at one point that i thought india declared war and they
01:15:50 fired a bunch of the trains into the air and they exploded because the sky was covered
01:15:54 shit colored brown gross gross is right i couldn't breathe everything smelled bad it was awful uh
01:16:04 yikes um well so okay so i guess i guess that answer is where your money comes from came from
01:16:13 yeah uh what what what what else what else do we want to talk about anything you guys want i'm
01:16:21 hoping to talk about anything you can ask me what jeffrey eppstein killed himself
01:16:27 why why did jeffrey eppstein why would he do such a thing he had so much to live for
01:16:31 i don't know if you're a guy who has like a long fucking track record of raping and trafficking
01:16:36 kids dating all the way back to the 60s i i would think like that'd be concerned for somebody wanting
01:16:41 to kill you that's ridiculous that's totally ridiculous never never heard of i'm sure billionaire
01:16:48 people like the ross chow family and george soros would never put a hit on eppstein's head because
01:16:53 he fucked everything up and now everything's all wrong and the and the trafficking networks just
01:16:58 aren't working anymore clear clearly this was a suicide we all we all we all know it was we all
01:17:03 know it was the clinton's though right we know that mr eppstein got on his second story bed he said
01:17:08 look i'm going to do a flip right now i'm going to do a matt sidale for the shooting star press
01:17:13 and then he put more down and broke his neck that's clearly the narrative because you know believe
01:17:19 yeah uh well good good good you know good for him and glad he lived his he he lived his life
01:17:25 before it's raping children proud of my boy who'll make me proud of my boy eppstein
01:17:32 uh hey somebody fucking say something we i'm on my brain has been my brain has been rendered
01:17:40 smooth by this conversation i don't have anything voicemail if you want i guess we're going to voicemail
01:17:45 a shitload of them and we are going to be going for an hour and 18 minutes we have fewer than usual
01:17:50 but we have like a dozen or some some murd you want to do you want to hang out while we answer
01:17:54 voicemails or they just got here they just got things in general they are not about you nobody
01:18:00 nobody knows you're on until the episode comes out so no they're not about you specifically
01:18:05 so are we just done here like do you need me here anymore or i mean if you want to stick around
01:18:13 then sure if if nobody else has any you know a discussion i guess i guess we'll go to voicemails
01:18:20 unless uh yeah i don't know we you can you can i had my most pressing question answered which is
01:18:25 can i get paid to hold wonderbread in a picture maybe in the future i'm so into the idea
01:18:36 no i just want to be in a picture too for some cash digi really fucking wants to make some money
01:18:43 right now i just i just want to know if i can and it sounds like the answer is i could if you had
01:18:49 money so that's a good i mean that would depend upon like you know there's there's like a good
01:18:54 cute there's like chihiro from dank and rompa cute there's princess marco cute but like not every
01:19:01 3d equivalent of something that's cute is always cute you got to be convincing that's why it's called
01:19:05 yeah no yeah well there's good yeah i you know there's uh there's there's makeup there's filters
01:19:12 there's lots you can do you see snapchat is a wonderful thing it makes the reality the way i
01:19:16 want it to look yeah i have i have apps for that for on my instagram all my instagram pictures i
01:19:24 look different in every single one because i use different filters then you gotta sit digi down and
01:19:30 say his dream is this not gonna happen like you know you really want this to happen but it's not
01:19:35 um you mean you mean this this business arrangement it's it's questionable it can't
01:19:41 happen because there's nobody there's not enough money involved for it to ever for it to happen
01:19:45 anyways i don't know i mean i got my logic was that projects right i mean i already got
01:19:49 straight porn being made right now and i'm paying off in september i already got down payments i have
01:19:54 to fucking fulfill i'm running to missy talk dark money being fun what's okay i want to i don't ask
01:20:05 you said you one you said you do it part of the reason you do it is to raise your online profile
01:20:10 do you have like an end game of like once you're known enough you know like you're gonna do something
01:20:17 is this project all building to some conclusion i thought to myself there was no way i was ever
01:20:23 going to reach a pkp posting after roosterteeth themselves fucking did a video on my deviant
01:20:28 art and they were looking out over all my deviant art stuff and i got really disappointed because
01:20:32 they didn't look at any of the ruby art all my carefully constructed ruby art of assaulting in
01:20:37 winter making out and made my pp very big why wouldn't they look at that because they didn't
01:20:43 have the time to look at it and it makes me sad because y'all created ruby look at my ruby art
01:20:48 that's what i really want you to look at that seems like that would be the first thing they would
01:20:51 look at i don't know it doesn't make any sense to me first it was that then i had the creator of
01:20:55 mighty magisort straight up tell me that i'm the worst human being on the face of the planet i hope
01:20:59 nobody ever draws me commission art so there was that i had the guy who created cookie well do you
01:21:05 know what the guy who created mighty magisort has one of the shittiest podcasts ever and made fun
01:21:10 of it on w ATP once so fuck that guy i had the guy who created cookie cookie clicker mentioned me
01:21:18 frequently on tumblr for whatever reason because he thinks my shit i love that guy he thinks my
01:21:23 shitposting is amusing so there was that um i love what's his name he's like it's like drag
01:21:29 that's his name something like that i've been on the master's in show i'm thinking to myself it's
01:21:35 like that has to be the peak now i'm here i'm thinking to myself it's like i need to create a
01:21:40 you've reached an ever higher peak yeah yeah so so now that you've now that you've conquered the
01:21:44 world and been on the procrastinators podcast i mean where is there even to go from here obviously
01:21:49 to go back on the master's in show again because i have lots to talk about okay yeah sure um i think
01:21:57 as i was saying about you being a branding genius like you were you were saying that
01:22:00 you keep commissioning them partially just to keep your name out there and uh like you said it's
01:22:05 landed you on all these podcasts and like i have i have a similar kind of like um i perpetuate
01:22:12 the existence of fan art of myself by always reblogging any fan art that anybody makes of me
01:22:19 and it seems that's not as i don't see it as much i seem to get more fan art than most people
01:22:27 by way of like just constantly promoting the fan art i get because then like people see it and
01:22:31 they want to copy it and then it's like every time i get one a bunch more like follows soon
01:22:36 afterwards and it's uh it's a good way to it's like a good way to create a brand identity
01:22:43 without even having to like let's like not like i have like a cartoon version of me
01:22:48 that like exists solidified at a bunch of people's minds you know what i mean
01:22:53 i mean you know whatever floats your boat my god i'm just in this to kum i need pretty pictures
01:22:58 to kum too don't we all is that the note is that the note we want to go out on yeah i think so

01:27:35 so much for making the pcp um your content means a lot to me and i appreciate all the stuff you
01:27:41 guys make oh wow okay moving on i have a series of four questions that i'd like to ask all of you
01:27:45 guys circumcision circumcision so the first is do you guys believe that people have an innate
01:27:51 responsibility to help one another why or why not the next is do you guys believe that unconditional
01:27:59 love is real why why not the third is does hardship really make someone stronger or do you believe
01:28:08 that's just a way to cope and finally would you guys prefer i do a drawing of brook and labud
01:28:15 or a picture of death the kid with liz and pat and tweeted at you guys all right thanks so much
01:28:22 thanks for making the pcp i really appreciate what you guys do um it's a little pretty big
01:28:28 questions in our own death the kid uh who is who is liz and pat the two girls are the guns
01:28:34 the gun girls that death the kid fights with uh oh you know wait i don't know what that's
01:28:41 from i don't fucking soul leader you do know what it's from god damn you've seen soul leader you
01:28:46 nerd i've seen the first three episodes of soul leader and i thought it was shit they introduced
01:28:50 definitely i did it i did i actually like soul leader a lot because of it actually like soul
01:28:55 leader a lot it's good it just doesn't it has a shitty ending because the manga was still going
01:28:59 and they had to wrap it up um but other than that it's great um well agreed wait i'm looking
01:29:05 at labudans better anyway liz and patty oh no they suck i don't like them uh the the other
01:29:13 questions he asked okay unconditional love uh uh no is is wait wait is unconditional love real uh
01:29:23 yes it is real but it shouldn't be i don't think it's real how do you think it's real what is it
01:29:28 what is that thing cool well it's when you it's when you love someone and no matter what they do
01:29:35 which is stupid like a like a decision you make i know i know i know that there are people who will
01:29:40 love somebody no matter how bad they are no matter how they mistreat them they shouldn't that is real
01:29:45 but that i would not i don't think that is unconditional per se like like how is okay that's
01:29:53 what it means the conditions are very very low bar well yeah exactly but it means it means the
01:29:58 conditions are very are in are unrealistically high that like it could never meet them to stop to
01:30:03 stop loving them there if there are people who will forgive someone literally anything there are
01:30:09 people who there okay but what i'm trying to say is like like okay so let's say that you have like
01:30:15 a brother and no matter what he does you'll still love him because he's your brother that's the condition
01:30:22 like it's can if you wouldn't do this for anybody you would only do this for your brother
01:30:26 because he's your brother but like yeah but like but this person being who they are there is nothing
01:30:31 they could do that would make you not love them i just can't imagine how you would find out like
01:30:38 like if you fall in love with someone then like it's not unconditional it's like there's something
01:30:48 about them that made you fall in love with them you know what i mean but like unconditional love
01:30:52 would have to just be like sprayed everywhere at all times because there's no condition but once
01:30:56 you're but once you're in now that's stupid once you're in love with someone if there's nothing
01:31:01 that could make you stop then that's unconditional there i don't i think there are people who i think
01:31:07 that is cope semantics is how is that cope like it's just fucking you know not you mean something
01:31:13 i'm saying that unconditional love is cope like it is i mean it's it's very bad and stupid and i
01:31:19 don't i don't think well it's it's like you're convincing yourself that's that no matter what
01:31:25 you will love this person because that is easier than having there have to be like conditions so
01:31:32 it's it's like the the condition for it to stop is this is none unconditional yeah yeah yeah that's
01:31:41 that's bad i don't like that i think it's very very rare that it actually gets to such a point
01:31:47 they need to be like totally mindbroken that nothing would like absolutely nothing would
01:31:52 change their mind i mean people people write like uh love letters to like murders and prison and stuff
01:32:01 so it's real what do you mean what the fuck what the fuck do you mean
01:32:07 eh i don't fight me i'm having a trouble understanding what this concept i'm having a
01:32:13 trouble i'm having a trouble right here let's move on he also has many other he said do we
01:32:19 do people have an innate responsibility to help each other i mean response there's no
01:32:24 any there's no such thing as an innate responsibility like responsibility is
01:32:28 something that we judge i think we made we made up i think it would be fair to say that we have
01:32:33 instinctual reasons to help one another that like compel does an innate like desire for people to
01:32:40 cooperate that's like just sort of like a an instinctual thing yeah a responsibility though i
01:32:46 don't know about that no no and then the last part he asked was hard does hardship make you stronger
01:32:52 or is that just absolutely yes it does hardship makes you stronger uh i think i think in some cases
01:32:59 it might i think there's a huge ripping off of the band aid effect that comes with almost everything
01:33:04 in life that like anything that you are like afraid of or build up in your mind that like once you
01:33:09 experience it it can never be like scary again you know like unless it was really fucking bad like
01:33:16 and you really don't want to go through it again you know i don't know going through going through
01:33:20 hardship can make you like more afraid and wary of i guess it can happen i guess it can be better
01:33:28 or worse it just depends on how well you deal with it like it's like you know muscle growth is you
01:33:34 tear it and then it builds back but you have to eat enough protein or else it's not going to build back
01:33:39 you know it's like if you're just tearing your muscles and not fucking eating anything so wait
01:33:44 what was this question that there was it does hardship make you stronger or is that just cope
01:33:50 i think there's it's not just cope but it can be yeah i think i agree it can some some
01:33:56 sometimes it can be like oh i came out of it and like now i learned what not to do or or i learned
01:34:02 that i that it's not as bad as i thought but sometimes it is as bad as you thought and sometimes
01:34:08 it just can like fuck you up and like ruin your worldview and like make you a more miserable human
01:34:12 being because like now you know if you take the you know the breaking of muscle analogy to bones
01:34:19 once you break a bone you're much more likely to break the bone in that one spot again and again
01:34:24 yeah yeah yeah it cuts both ways all right good questions though um the next one is called um
01:34:33 i'm stupid the next one is called uh trying to be fear and loathing in real life three two one go
01:34:43 okay all right next one is called uh pancakes all boomers must die three two one go hey pcp
01:35:01 you know it really grinds my gears or really butters my buns this one someone does something
01:35:07 that i don't really like and i criticize for it and some fucking boomer has the brass of balls to
01:35:13 say uh you know they have the right to do that yeah yeah yeah oh god i just want to get my fingers
01:35:23 around their necks in terms of the major's favorite shade of purple because for one i'm not saying
01:35:28 they don't have the right to do that that's a different conversation and second of all just
01:35:33 because someone has the right to do something doesn't mean it's always the right thing to do
01:35:37 and that's what i'm criticizing them for you boomers basis of fucking garbage uh i would just
01:35:43 agree with that yeah when you when you credit when you when you when you criticize someone
01:35:47 it's not you're not you can't always just be like oh well they have the right to do it because
01:35:52 that's not always the issue yeah it's it's it's like you just see something you say oh fuck this
01:35:57 it's like whether allowed to it's like that i the only fuck yeah the only time that like they have
01:36:02 the right to do it is the response is if the person is saying they can't do that or they
01:36:06 don't have the right to do it well if they do then maybe correct them but if that's not what
01:36:10 they're saying if they're saying oh this sucks like i you know this person is a piece of shit for
01:36:14 doing this it's not you know maybe they they might do something that's legal and still and that's
01:36:19 still be the case um so yeah i would just agree pancakes i would just agree um next one is called
01:36:28 in before god damn it three two one go

01:41:13 with it but now you can oh okay three two one go having your wisdom teeth pulled is the circumcision
01:41:21 of adulthood i mean i had my wisdom teeth i was a kid so oh really not really i all right i don't
01:41:30 know too much at least at least they sent that they say they anesthetize you to get your wisdom
01:41:34 teeth out isn't there like a a reason that they would take them out like it because they hurt
01:41:41 if they hurt yeah i mean okay grow bad is not an objective criteria you know like i don't know
01:41:47 like the thing about dentistry uh dentists are the worst people which is why they have such a
01:41:52 high suicide rate um and it's because dentistry is worthless it's just cosmetic it's not they
01:42:01 try to tell you there's all these fucking health benefits to cleaning your fucking teeth but truly
01:42:06 you just want to have white ass straight ass teeth so you look good on camera and but but the wisdom
01:42:13 teeth thing they push they push the teeth they push your other teeth in such a way that can make them
01:42:19 you know less straight or they can hurt personally i have wisdom teeth they don't hurt don't really
01:42:26 care to have them removed don't really see what the point is i i have wisdom teeth as well um
01:42:34 i i i i never understood every single time i see a dentist they're like i just assumed that if
01:42:40 you get them removed it's because like oh yeah you know you ever seen the picture that episode of
01:42:44 the simpsons where the Lisa goes the dentist and she gets braces and it's like if you don't have
01:42:48 braces your teeth will go fucking through your eyeball that'll happen if you don't okay braces
01:42:52 the worst meme in the whole universe because you wear them for years and then you wear a retainer
01:42:57 every day for the rest of your life so they don't straighten your teeth like they they will get them
01:43:01 into a position where you can maintain them in that position but i stopped wearing i stopped wearing
01:43:07 a retainer i actually like never wore my retainer and like it's fine like it didn't my teeth didn't
01:43:12 go back to being shit i've seen people's teeth go back to being shit before it was braces didn't
01:43:19 work but um you know uh shit well i was like oh yeah the every time you go to a dentist for any
01:43:26 reason they'll they'll they they frame it in that salesman like way where they'll say when are you
01:43:32 getting your wisdom teeth removed like when should i schedule you for a wisdom teeth removal like who
01:43:38 should i refer to you to and the response i always say is like do i need to have them out and they
01:43:44 well do they hurt or like they will hurt and i say well they don't hurt now so like do i need to
01:43:50 have them out they're like well i mean technically no i'm like well then why is it being framed to
01:43:56 me like it is absolutely inevitable that you are going to pull out my wisdom teeth but like they
01:44:01 frame it that way because they want you to spend the money on it obviously maybe maybe my parents
01:44:06 just fell for the meme i don't know everyone all society has fallen for the meme every time well
01:44:12 i mean in the uk they didn't push it on on me they just they're just sort of like i don't even remember
01:44:20 them saying anything about it actually i just go to the dentist they look around they say yeah that's
01:44:24 good americans are really weird about teeth we don't care about being fat as fuck we only care
01:44:29 about having straight white teeth it's a strange place uh next one is called down with mortality
01:44:37 propagandists three two one go have you ever been talking with someone about immortality
01:44:43 in there like oh yeah if humans weren't if humans didn't die then it would suck actually yeah there
01:44:47 would be no time with it on life i hate this meme this is good call already anything cooler
01:44:52 productive sooner than later we just procrastinate forever and lays around this always seems
01:44:56 strange to me because like by the very fact that this is framed as a negative it means that you
01:45:00 wouldn't let this happen like suppose you were immoral right and you were upset at the fact that
01:45:06 you're not doing anything you wouldn't think oh man i wish i had the ability to die because then
01:45:13 i would have a reason to do something no you would think man i should do something i'm not doing
01:45:17 something so i'll go do something yeah it's right it's is that not obvious it like what a stupid
01:45:23 what a stupid idea to be like oh boy well good it's it's good that we die because it like makes
01:45:29 people like you know make their fucking magnum opus or like who fucking anybody who thinks that
01:45:33 do that sorry anybody who thinks that clearly hates their life like yeah you'd have to you'd
01:45:39 have to be a fucking moron and like just have like absolutely no value to your own life to be like
01:45:44 it's good that one day i will cease to exist um yeah it's i mean it goes even further than just
01:45:50 that reason it's like like if you're immortal you can't die um you don't need to do anything
01:45:59 what's the problem with not doing anything yeah also yeah if you if if you're content
01:46:04 not doing anything i mean if you're not content then you have forever to do stuff there's always
01:46:09 like there's no downside really the arguments they always portray it as like oh i've been alive for
01:46:14 10 billion years and i'm so bored if only there was something that was interesting in this shonen anime
01:46:23 uh and i'm the villain uh-huh it's like it's i don't know whether i mean there's no way to
01:46:28 really know what happens to the human brain but like the reason people go crazy when they get
01:46:33 older is not because it they live for a long times because human bodies age and they become
01:46:38 decrepit and they the cells die and then they they lose their functionality if you didn't have any
01:46:43 of that if you just were fine forever i don't know whether anything of that is bad would happen
01:46:51 i mean i mean i guess eventually overpopulation like we might just i don't know if everyone's
01:46:56 immortal you mean if if like yeah if the entire world were just like choked with humans but like
01:47:01 i don't think that would necessarily be a problem it's just there's just like not enough biomass
01:47:05 oh this happens in final fantasy 13 lightning returns and uh everybody becomes immortal and
01:47:10 they just stop being able to have kids and so there's just like the same people who are around
01:47:15 for like five thousand years that's what that's what happens in 17776 is one day everyone just
01:47:20 stops aging and stops being able to have kids and the world just becomes a complete and it's
01:47:24 awesome like it's so awesome i want to live in 17776 but lightning returns is pretty cool too uh
01:47:30 there's like all these odin gods and shit running around doing stuff it's neat there was this there
01:47:35 was this like um uh dnd like green text post thing i i read once which was really interesting um and
01:47:44 it reminds me of this this idea that like if if you could have children and you were immortal
01:47:50 the amount of human mass would just continually like grow out of control and the the dnd post was
01:47:57 like there was a skeleton and it had the ability to summon a skeleton that could summon a skeleton
01:48:04 and then um they failed at killing the skeleton and after a few rounds there was like a hundred
01:48:09 skeletons it was multiplying exponentially and so they had to run they had to run far away
01:48:15 and the skeletons never stopped and they just sort of like they saw in the in the distance
01:48:19 there was like a writhing mass of bones constantly undulating and growing and and it was taking over
01:48:24 the entire planet and the sea and they were like all over the place it was just like oh my god
01:48:30 yeah it's like it's like doubling itself every round yeah and it's like they couldn't do anything
01:48:36 and then like they all died the entire planet became filled with skeletons so that you couldn't
01:48:42 see it the skeletons continued to grow outwards until the mass of the skeletons was so great
01:48:47 that it collapsed in on itself and it became a black hole or a supernova
01:48:53 yeah something something like and it created a new star and that star was like named after
01:48:57 like the event and then in their future dm campaign uh dungeons and dragons campaigns that
01:49:03 star was in the sky and they could like look at it that's so funny that's so fucking funny so that's
01:49:09 that's what would happen if you could still have kids and be immortal is that if unless we
01:49:13 spread out we would become okay if you're immortal does that mean you cannot die or just that you
01:49:19 don't die of natural causes i would assume you just cannot die if you can't die then i don't know
01:49:26 that's that that's weird and like yeah i guess maybe you would just eventually just choke the whole
01:49:32 world with humans but that seems like stupid like if you could die of natural causes like and
01:49:37 we did just eventually use up all of like the carbon on earth and like to create biomass for
01:49:43 human beings eventually there would just be no more human beings and we would just have to literally
01:49:48 have to eat each other in order to like feed on anything god it's such a cool premise for a place
01:49:54 because there'd be nothing else to eat there'd be no more plants or animals all carbon on the world
01:49:58 would be devoted to human being human life uh yeah like like like the magma the the mantle or whatever
01:50:05 is like all it was how would that even happen like all of the rock that makes up the earth gets
01:50:12 replaced slowly with human biomass this is filled the human like it just becomes the earth is just
01:50:20 filled to the core with a writhing mass of beings crammed in gross oh cool um that's that's what
01:50:28 hell i have to address the the other thing about immortality that everybody always is like
01:50:34 i don't want to be immortal because i have to watch all my friends die and everybody you love
01:50:38 die if you're like the only one i'm sure that would suck but like i'm sure that would suck the thing is
01:50:43 a you're gonna do that anyway if you live long enough like but like yeah you can make more friends
01:50:49 like it's it's like it's like like the like the logical conclusion of that is like oh
01:50:54 they're so so what you're saying is that you should kill yourself now before anyone you know dies
01:50:59 right yeah like that's what you're saying you want like death is prefer death is preferable
01:51:02 to seeing someone you love die yeah that's what you're saying right people seem to think that
01:51:06 they're going to like run out and like the only reason that old people like run out is that they
01:51:11 know they're going to die and so they don't like make an effort to like make a bunch of new things
01:51:17 begin in their life it's like when you it's it's hard to like even for young people like
01:51:23 young people don't want to hang around old people because they know they're going to die soon you
01:51:27 know like the the the attraction of being younger is knowing how much potential is ahead of you
01:51:33 you know and like i think that the the way that human life tends to be structured is just based
01:51:41 on the fact that we happen to live the amount of time we do but like if you were immortal
01:51:46 you would just have no reason to ever stop being involved in everything you know in the
01:51:52 world like personally i want to be able to see like the ramifications of things across generations
01:51:58 you know like i can see like i get to watch the effects of my actions for as long as i'm alive
01:52:04 for what if i got to see like the ripple of that across fucking thousands of years you know um
01:52:11 i want to know what's going to happen to humanity i'm interested in this story
01:52:15 it sucks that i don't get to see very much of it you know i think absolutely the only real thing
01:52:22 that could be like oh it's bad to be immortal is not for the person who is immortal but it's like
01:52:28 you could become a villain that is unstoppable and you could start just for fun just fucking with
01:52:34 other people and murdering them and you'll be like yeah i mean i've killed so many people it
01:52:37 doesn't even feel that bad anymore in the same way that seeing your friends die over and over again
01:52:42 for thousands of years you'd be like yeah that friends die that's normal it doesn't already feel
01:52:47 that way you could easily like get dull to a lot of things and then you could be the bad guy and
01:52:54 that's i feel that way just from having like because i've moved so many times in my life that
01:52:58 like the idea that people just pass through your life is very normal to me like yeah you just sometimes
01:53:03 just don't see motherfuckers anymore you know so like yeah to me the idea is like but you like
01:53:08 that doesn't prevent you from newly having a best another best friend you know like there's always
01:53:14 going to be interesting people you want to hang out with so like you know just because some of them
01:53:19 die doesn't mean the new ones aren't springing up for you to hang out with you know like there's
01:53:23 always going to be somebody who's interesting yeah agree uh yeah fun things like trying to be like
01:53:30 mortality for 100 years straight but by a similar token uh it's not the same but i feel like it's
01:53:38 related people there's always one idiot at like any party who if pressed will say like oh yeah i kind
01:53:45 of think like humanity should be destroyed lol like we are the virus and like i fucking hate those
01:53:50 people if we are the virus we will be we will be corrected anyways like those people are sick but
01:53:56 like it's been normalized it's been normalized as sort of like like baby's first edgy take that's
01:54:00 like how the world would be better off without humanity like fuck you like go fuck yourself i
01:54:05 don't know start with you yourself please literally start with yourself like if you think
01:54:10 be the change you want to see like i know like i know humanity does bad things to other people
01:54:16 to other species but i'm not a other species i'm a human and as a human i am i'm i'm bigoted in
01:54:22 my own favor i i am invested in humanity's success like sorry if that's a fucking problem for you
01:54:29 there's a there's a guy there's a guy that i started following i don't know why on twitter
01:54:33 he's some kind of like he's some kind of like like um anarcho primitivist like like eco terrorist
01:54:41 communist guy or whatever and he says that like he's he's he's he's he's super like pro animal
01:54:47 rights but he if that's not even good enough for him he says like yeah like humanity like
01:54:52 fuck humanity uh we need to protect animals but even that's not good enough because animals
01:54:57 would just be colonizers like humans if they could even animals are like too are too corrupt
01:55:02 only only the plants and fun guy like our our true allies yeah this is a good argument
01:55:10 i don't know why um i thought he was funny that anyway yeah um life isn't it good yeah
01:55:17 but plants fight each other too the trees they hug all of the sunlight for the little flowers
01:55:21 underneath so we need to chop down all the trees there's trouble with the trees for the maples
01:55:26 want more sunlight and the oaks ignore their pleas but but they don't do it on with on purpose
01:55:32 they don't do it with malice of forethought we'll see the trouble with the maples and they're quite
01:55:37 convinced they're right is that the oaks are just too lofty and they grab up all the light but the
01:55:42 oaks can't help their feelings if they like the way they're made and they wonder why the maples
01:55:46 can't be happy in their shade no it's a rush song and then pacifica northwest comes in she destroys
01:55:52 them all makes bread well at the end they they pass along yeah they pass a law that the trees are all
01:55:57 kept equal by hatchet ax and saw oh my god yeah one from the law x soldier rides away uh it's
01:56:08 libertarian propaganda about how how socialism bad i think
01:56:16 uh wait is that is that what rush is like i think that song is at least some like i mean the
01:56:21 message of the song is basically that like you know uh the the maples are like the oaks are
01:56:29 taking up all of our sunlight and they're like well there's nothing we could do about it and they're
01:56:32 like yeah there is what will all be equal and so they all get cut down like oh man you ever you
01:56:37 ever read that book animal farm you ever read animal farm that like fairy tale like yeah man
01:56:42 like communism would never work lamal uh uh that's the proof uh you ever hear that rush song nah dude
01:56:49 we need fucking like billionaires to have child sex slaves in my opinion uh next one next one or
01:56:58 or is there more yes next one is called a hot water is amazing and margar is gay three two one go
01:57:06 hey so have you guys ever thought about how you just turn a tap and you can get hot water
01:57:15 that is pretty fucking amazing when you really think about it like it was only like what a couple
01:57:23 of thousand years ago we couldn't maintain a fire we couldn't even start a fire and now us hairless apes
01:57:30 at the point where we can just turn a tap and we instantly get hot water that is pretty fucking
01:57:38 amazing that's like our greatest accomplishment good on us if there is anything anything at all
01:57:45 that we should be thankful for it is the ability to get hot water all right i get it hot water and
01:57:51 there's also one more thing that we should be thankful for and it is a me samurai summer
01:58:00 fuck are you i'm sorry sorry about the scroll sorry about the scroll all right yeah hot water is
01:58:07 pretty good uh are some of these people like duplicates are they like doing the voice i can't

01:58:22 they got the naruto a shadow clone shadow clone jutsu yeah yeah exactly next next one is called
01:58:30 sebek three two one go fencing more like based saint you said this on twitter and i agree wow thank
01:58:43 thanks very much next one is called cross music in other languages uh there it is three two one go
01:58:54 you guys were talking about accents and language in the last episode and it got me curious what you
01:58:59 think about music and other languages personally i think it's fantastic it's a great way to gain
01:59:03 comprehension in a language plus there's the whole point that they made in his anime and music video
01:59:08 about how if you don't understand what's being said completely you can imprint whatever you find
01:59:12 to be the most appealing message onto a song also i don't know if anyone can relate to this but i
01:59:17 feel like music and languages that are not english tend to have way better instrumentals i don't know
01:59:22 thoughts uh i think that's just not true i don't i don't think you're right about that i don't
01:59:28 think you're right about that last one i think you're probably just maybe paying more attention
01:59:31 to the instrumentals maybe because you can't focus on the words um i i like listening to uh foreign
01:59:37 music obviously tons of japanese music and like there's lots of countries that like make music
01:59:44 that sounds like stuff that would be from america or the uk like influenced by that stuff just sings
01:59:50 in english because like they want to have more global appeal ah so i i've i've um recently
01:59:56 discovered some like saharan desert like prog rock that sounds like jimmy hendrix but it with like um
02:00:05 islam islamic uh you know singing it's really cool it's like a language the arabic islamic
02:00:14 arabic where'd you where'd you study in arabic yeah look i um stupid okay do you send a link
02:00:22 to that band uh yeah let me let me get have you wait have you have you kept studying arabic
02:00:27 actually i i sort of dropped off because because the um the app sort of it's sort of
02:00:35 it got to a peak of like what it could teach me with me like learning new stuff i was just
02:00:40 sort of doing the same things over and over again and i needed i needed to like step up the amount
02:00:46 the the level of teaching in order to actually learn how to like speak it and and stuff and i
02:00:52 never went into that much because the app was so easy i needed i needed to like study it like a real
02:00:59 thing and they're like that's hard i don't want to do anything definitely sounds hard lamal um yeah i
02:01:05 like music in other languages like fucking i was a kid listen to fucking anime op's and be like ah
02:01:11 this is so beautiful what a beautiful language i don't know what it means but it you just it
02:01:16 could just entirely focus on the melody and it can mean whatever you want it to me there are certain
02:01:19 languages that have like different advantages when it comes to being sung and i think that
02:01:24 english is a language that is popular because partially because it sounds really good in music
02:01:30 um broad range of vowel sounds like japanese there's only five vowel sounds that they use
02:01:35 in their language so like um you know there's like a lot of cleanliness to japanese singing because
02:01:43 of the fact that like again they only use like uh they only use syllables like full syllables to
02:01:52 communicate so like their words are more simple and easier to pronounce and easier to make melodies
02:01:58 out of um i i don't okay i could be wrong but i think i read something by like an essay or maybe
02:02:06 it was an intro to lolita by nabokov the the guy who wrote lolita and other books too um and i think
02:02:12 he said that he wrote because he was russian but he wrote in english he like lolita is not translated
02:02:18 he wrote it in english and he wrote him any other books in english too and i'm pretty sure the reason
02:02:22 why is because he found english was like a very lyrical language or a poetic language or a language
02:02:27 that he found it was easy to make like like like a poetic like illusions and like similes and
02:02:34 metaphors and stuff with i think he just found english to be good for that better than russian
02:02:39 so i guess some languages are more like that than others in ways yeah i think it depends on like
02:02:45 that like you said lyrical and like i'm thinking about like the difference between lyrical and
02:02:51 poetic as like how they could because i'm thinking about like how lyrical miracle spiritual like in
02:02:55 chinese they have like ridiculous amounts of like metaphors and different meanings for words to the
02:03:01 point that there's like this one poem that famously is just like she written like 50 times but it's
02:03:06 all different definitions of she um but like uh buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo yeah like that but
02:03:13 much more extreme um yeah and like so chinese has that advantage of like it can be extremely
02:03:20 metaphorical and poetic and impressionistic um but like it doesn't sound as good sung because
02:03:27 there's so much like uh of the throat i think that has to be like used you know like a lot of
02:03:32 languages that use more like it's like it's not as easy to say that english everything is just
02:03:50 you know like that's what it sounds like center it sounds like center language wait
02:03:55 wait was that a creed or who who is that an impression of uh fuck that songs by like i don't
02:04:00 counting crows or something wait wait wait is that hoody in the blowfish
02:04:04 no it's like a really mellow song Dave Matthews band no no it's mellower than any of that it's
02:04:12 it's that it's that band with with the black um front man that is hoody in the brush fish but
02:04:17 oh okay you're right all right the the guy i was thinking of was mudo mokta i don't know how to say
02:04:25 his name i think that's it i posted a link he's like he's just so cool he's he's playing the guitar
02:04:32 upside down like hendrix clearly inspired by that and he's just like singing about stuff and and it's
02:04:39 got that that uh his definite like a definite different like tone to like the way they're playing
02:04:46 it he looks so awesome not western he looks so awesome in this like with his his his turban and
02:04:52 his like face fail it's like so rad i don't know that's good um
02:05:00 i don't know good any more of uh voicemails there's one more yeah sorry there's one last one and um
02:05:08 wait fucking fucking posts please there we go this one is called salty dog three two one go
02:05:17 okay so ben was talking about super salty stuff yeah and it reminded me of this game that i used
02:05:22 to play with friends at some gatherings uh called salty dog where what you do have however many
02:05:27 people at a table you get that many sugar packets you rip them all open but fold them over so the
02:05:32 contents don't come out but one of them you pour it out and replace it with salt so then you mix up
02:05:38 all of the sugar packets everyone grabs one at random and three two one you just pour it into your
02:05:43 mouth all together at the same time and one person is the unlucky fool who is the salty dog who gets
02:05:51 a mouthful of like a whole packet of salt at once this is just russian real entertaining ragcon five
02:05:57 salty dog tournament win this is just russian roulette with salt i mean isn't a big full mouthful
02:06:05 of sugar also a bit weird i guess it's not as bad no it's not that bad no i used to eat sugar just
02:06:11 like i used to go to mcdonald's and just grab handfuls of sugar packets stuff them in my pockets
