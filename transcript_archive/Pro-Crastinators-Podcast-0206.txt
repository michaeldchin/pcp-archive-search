00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm
00:00:09 the best guy ever and let's see here we've got Gibbontake over here.
00:00:14 Hey guys, go to Gibbontake.site to read comics that I make. This is a, I'm gonna chill my
00:00:19 comics forever every single time I speak.
00:00:22 That's an option. We've got Tom Oliver over here.
00:00:25 Why is Final Fantasy VII Remake sold out on Amazon?
00:00:29 Sold out?
00:00:30 It's sold out. We can't fucking buy it and I refuse to buy a digital copy.
00:00:35 You're a better man than I. I bought digital.
00:00:37 Bullshit.
00:00:38 Coward.
00:00:39 I just don't care.
00:00:40 I just don't have the hard drive space. I've done the research, apparently it takes
00:00:42 up less space on your hard drive if you have a disc.
00:00:45 That makes sense. I believe it's, it was 87 gigs if I remember correctly.
00:00:49 Ooh.
00:00:50 It's a lot of space.
00:00:51 Holy shit.
00:00:52 A lot of fucking space.
00:00:53 And we've got...
00:00:54 For one third of a game.
00:00:55 Less than that, bro. Less than that. But we've got her here.
00:00:59 Endless Jess, of course.
00:01:00 Hey, it's me doing my yearly like three episodes of this show before I get to be here again.
00:01:04 Guys, we've got to talk about this fucking, what you just said.
00:01:08 This whole, this digital copy standalone. Oh wait, Nate did this himself, but you know
00:01:12 him.
00:01:13 You know me.
00:01:14 So like, I was, it was like the day before the game came out and I was looking at it like
00:01:17 it was like, oh, pre-order now and you can download the game early and then it will unlock
00:01:21 at midnight.
00:01:22 So I'm like, yeah, okay.
00:01:24 I mean, it's like no one can go out.
00:01:26 So I can't get a physical copy, I guess I might as well do this.
00:01:29 So it's like, okay, there's like standard edition for $60.
00:01:33 There's like the big edition for $80.
00:01:35 And like the big edition just has like a cactar summon and a carbuncle and a useless digital
00:01:40 art book.
00:01:41 Seems like, you know, not worth it, but it's like, ah, it might as well.
00:01:45 I guess I have to, you know, get the main, the big edition.
00:01:48 Yeah.
00:01:49 They got me by the balls.
00:01:50 That's, we always knew that would be the case.
00:01:52 But so I get that and like the download before midnight thing doesn't work.
00:01:59 It doesn't do that for me.
00:02:00 I don't know if there's some kind of like, you have to learn to code to figure out how
00:02:03 to get it to actually do that.
00:02:05 You do have to learn to code.
00:02:06 Yeah.
00:02:07 So like, I bought it and like, I'm like, where, I don't understand.
00:02:12 Someone helped me and then I fell asleep and I woke up at like, you know, in the morning
00:02:15 and it like, it still wasn't there and I'm like, oh, come on.
00:02:17 What is this?
00:02:18 That's ridiculous.
00:02:19 I woke up on Christmas morning and finding like just a shit in a box instead of what
00:02:23 you wanted, which was a different kind of shit in a box in this case, a shit without
00:02:27 a box.
00:02:28 It's like that thing when parents say like, listen son, we're not going to buy you any
00:02:32 presents, but we're going to go out the day after Christmas or like two days and we'll
00:02:37 go buy you gifts and it's like, well, mom and dad, I mean, you know, I appreciate that's
00:02:41 economical.
00:02:42 I, you know, it's unfortunate that you don't love me, but you know, I mean, we can, we
00:02:46 can make this work, I guess.
00:02:47 But then the next day, I ended up having it.
00:02:49 I ended up having to go out for some reason and go to Walmart and like wade through the
00:02:52 sea of boomers and they're stupid little masks and everyone's got like, everyone's got like
00:02:56 a cute little camouflage pattern, like mask now and like little colors.
00:03:00 Like it's just, it's just a fashion statement now.
00:03:02 We're all okay with it.
00:03:03 We're all just okay with this.
00:03:04 It's totally fine.
00:03:05 It's the new normal.
00:03:06 You know, my mom, my mom made us a bunch of masks and sent them to us while I was out
00:03:10 at the grocery store.
00:03:11 We were wearing our masks.
00:03:12 Michelle, like a, like a cute little dog one, a lady just says like, Hey, where'd you get
00:03:15 those masks?
00:03:16 And I'm like, oh, my mom made them for us.
00:03:17 She's like, can I buy some from her, please?
00:03:19 Give me her contact information so I can have a mask.
00:03:22 And yeah, that's happening.
00:03:23 It's cool now.
00:03:24 There's nothing weird or wrong about it at all.
00:03:26 In fact, everyone was rightfully looking at me with disdain for not wearing a mask and
00:03:31 looking at me like the scum of the earth and just a mutant crawling up from the sewers
00:03:34 and walking among the streets to infect everyone in the populace for the crime of not wearing
00:03:39 a mask on my trip to Walmart.
00:03:41 But anyways, I'm at Walmart and I'm looking at the games behind the glass case and there
00:03:44 it is.
00:03:45 There's the physical copy.
00:03:46 First of all, I didn't realize that the physical copy would be fucking beautiful.
00:03:51 And it's, it's, it's the white, it's exactly like the original box, the same box art.
00:03:56 And I'm just like, well, too bad I already spent 80 bucks for the fucking digital.
00:04:01 And then I see the price tag.
00:04:03 It's 50 bucks.
00:04:04 The, why?
00:04:05 Oh, that's right.
00:04:06 They always mark it down.
00:04:07 That's true.
00:04:08 Why is the physical copy 50 bucks?
00:04:09 And the digital is at least 60.
00:04:10 That's a Walmart thing.
00:04:11 Is that just a Walmart thing?
00:04:12 For whatever reason?
00:04:13 Yeah.
00:04:14 The reason is go to Walmart to buy your games because they just mark down like all games
00:04:17 $10.
00:04:18 I don't know why.
00:04:19 Oh my God, what a crock of shit.
00:04:20 I was so mad.
00:04:21 I almost, I actually got the virus right then and there just because I was so upset.
00:04:27 It found its way through, it found like a weakness in my constitution and it got inside
00:04:31 me in that moment.
00:04:32 You're going to be hearing a lot of this of me in the coming weeks and months.
00:04:35 But there's some, seeing, I know nobody in the world cares, seeing the cover, I just
00:04:41 Google it, seeing the cover of this game being a long rectangle and not a square makes
00:04:46 me unreasonably angry.
00:04:48 It makes me want to rip my heart out and stop it on the, it's supposed to be a square.
00:04:53 It's like Square Enix.
00:04:55 Remember that company guys?
00:04:56 You are such an autist.
00:04:57 It's not even funny.
00:04:58 It's supposed to be a soft square made out of some kind of, made out of like noodle material.
00:05:04 Oh boy.
00:05:05 The disc should be a square shaped disc.
00:05:06 The only one of its kind.
00:05:09 The only thing about that, I, well, I don't know, my story is bad.
00:05:13 I'm just previncing with that information.
00:05:15 And it's just that I also downloaded the game pre-order because I just had to have, I just
00:05:20 had to have that extra chocobo chick materia that you get as a DLC pre-order bonus.
00:05:25 I didn't want it.
00:05:27 I didn't fucking, is there no option to just not get the pre-order things?
00:05:31 I literally hate them and don't want them.
00:05:33 I just want, okay, whatever.
00:05:35 But the, I realized in order to download it or when I bought the game, I'm like, why
00:05:40 isn't this downloading?
00:05:42 I should see something on my thing right now.
00:05:44 What's going on?
00:05:45 I, I Googled it and figured out in order to download ahead of time, you have to fucking
00:05:49 like navigate into like several sub menus and like, like choose to like preload the game
00:05:56 in like a week.
00:05:57 You'd think that would be like, I remember doing this before.
00:06:00 When you buy a game, there's like with Kingdom Hearts 3 on the screen, on the PlayStation
00:06:05 download library or whatever, or on the store, you just press X and it fucking downloads
00:06:09 and that's all you had to do it.
00:06:10 Why was this game different than you?
00:06:12 I had to go, I had to Google how to figure out how to download the game and navigate
00:06:16 to another weird menu.
00:06:17 It just had to be something.
00:06:18 That's not a game problem with a game, but what, what the fuck?
00:06:20 What was that?
00:06:21 It was a query.
00:06:22 They have to, they just, Square Enix can't help themselves.
00:06:25 They have something good and they just have to meddle with it.
00:06:28 Maybe it was like Sony.
00:06:29 Like maybe it's a, the platform itself is the problem, like they changed something about
00:06:32 how it works now.
00:06:33 I don't know.
00:06:34 I don't know if that's their fault, but like that night after I had purchased it digitally
00:06:38 and then fallen asleep, you know, before I woke up the next morning, that night I actually
00:06:43 had a dream about Final Fantasy seven and it was like, like I had a dream that I was
00:06:51 wrong and the game was good and it was beautiful.
00:06:55 It was like, this is not a bit.
00:06:58 This really happened.
00:06:59 I had this dream.
00:07:00 Sure.
00:07:01 And like in my dream, like Cloud and Tifa both had like Southern Hick Drawls cause they're
00:07:06 fucking Backwoods white folk.
00:07:08 Tifa's a cowboy.
00:07:09 And there was like all this like weird, like the, like the new stuff was like expanding
00:07:14 rather than like taking away and it was all like appropriate and respectful and it was
00:07:19 all good and wonderful.
00:07:20 And I'm like, oh my God, I was wrong.
00:07:22 I'm so happy to have been wrong.
00:07:23 And then I woke up back in the real world and realized I still have yet to play it.
00:07:27 And I'm like, oh no, oh, it can't possibly live up to my dream that I had.
00:07:33 So anyways, then I played it and I, well, okay.
00:07:39 First of all, I don't know how to fucking say this.
00:07:41 I assume you have a ton of complicated feelings that are hard to express.
00:07:45 I do.
00:07:46 I know I do.
00:07:47 First of all, like it's fucking phenomenal.
00:07:50 Like the game is fucking amazing.
00:07:52 Like, just like we said last week, like eight year old me has died and gone to heaven playing
00:07:58 this game right now.
00:07:59 Like I just got to wear, but like also I was right about everything.
00:08:05 You know?
00:08:06 Yeah.
00:08:07 Yep.
00:08:08 Yep.
00:08:09 So like, I like, I just got to wear like, I got to where you meet Tifa and you go to
00:08:11 the bar and you're in the slums and I'm just like looking around and like there's the bar
00:08:17 and there's the plate.
00:08:18 I can look in the sky and see how the, like the sun is shining through in certain spots
00:08:21 of the plate and I can see like this massive area that is now the slums and I can go around
00:08:26 and cloud has a little apartment right next to Tifa and there's like this little section
00:08:30 where you're just walking around with Tifa just going about your day doing side missions.
00:08:33 I did every side mission I could and just like, this is like the comfiest.
00:08:37 This is the best thing that's ever happened to me in my life is just I'm walking around
00:08:41 the slums with like the original waifu, my original wife Tifa.
00:08:46 I'm just walking around with her like going on side missions and like this is all I've
00:08:50 ever wanted in my entire life.
00:08:52 You go to the bar and like, you can actually, you can go behind the bar now.
00:08:57 Like my whole life, I've wanted to go behind that bar and you can't do it in the original
00:09:02 game and now you can, 10 out of 10, it's the greatest game ever made.
00:09:06 They fucking, you know, and so, and there's like, and there's like, there's like missions
00:09:10 where you, you learn more about the members of Avalanche.
00:09:13 They're really like trying to make you care more about Biggs and Wedge and Jesse.
00:09:17 You go to like Jesse's parents house and, you know, it's this, you meet, you know, you
00:09:21 have to sneak into her dad's room and her dad's, this is a kind of a spoiler, I guess,
00:09:25 but whatever you sneak into it, it's early in the game.
00:09:27 You sneak into her dad's room, her dad's got Mako Poisoning, he's there and you learn
00:09:31 about her, you learn about her plight.
00:09:32 You see cloud like starting to warm up like, like, I was so afraid that they would like
00:09:36 have him just be advent children cloud the whole game, just like the smoke.
00:09:40 Yeah.
00:09:41 No, he starts out like, correct.
00:09:42 He's like, he's like a trying really hard to be a nonchalant badass.
00:09:46 And like, you almost buy it at first, but it starts like, you see cracks in it as you
00:09:50 keep playing.
00:09:51 And then he starts warming up as he learns more about the members of Avalanche and their
00:09:54 plight.
00:09:55 He starts remembering how much he cares about Tifa, like the characterization is like actually
00:09:58 on point.
00:09:59 The voice acting is like, mostly incredible.
00:10:01 Like most of the characters are so well cast for once Tifa sounds great.
00:10:05 I think the dialogue is like actually good.
00:10:08 I can't believe, I cannot believe that the dialogue is good and like well written and
00:10:15 like how people actually talk and it doesn't feel like weird or like anime-ish and all
00:10:19 that.
00:10:20 And like I'm playing it.
00:10:21 So I'm like, I'm like five or six hours into it and this is a moment where I'm, I'm just
00:10:25 taking it in.
00:10:26 I'm just, I'm playing darts and I'm in the bar and I'm talking to Barrett and I'm looking
00:10:29 at Merlene and she's like scaring Barrett says, don't scare my daughter, you fool.
00:10:33 And I'm talking to Tifa and she's making me a drink and everything is great and it's
00:10:36 all wonderful and I'm in fucking heaven and I'm standing outside and I'm just looking
00:10:39 at the bar.
00:10:40 I'm looking at seventh heaven.
00:10:41 I have died and gone to seventh heaven.
00:10:42 I'm looking at the plate above.
00:10:44 I'm looking at the dirt on the ground below.
00:10:46 I'm looking at all the ramshackle fucking shacks all over the fucking slums and I'm
00:10:50 like this is it.
00:10:51 This is the, I can't believe it.
00:10:53 Maybe I was wrong.
00:10:54 Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe this can be an actual good experience.
00:10:59 And then the Nomura character shows up.
00:11:04 You're riding on your motorcycle and they do a little motorcycle mission and here comes
00:11:08 this guy, this new character called like Doge or Douche or something, some stupid fucking
00:11:15 name.
00:11:16 He's got like a stupid haircut and he's got a goatee like it's 1999 and he fucking, you
00:11:22 know, he looks more 1999 than the game which came out in the 90s and he's fucking, he's
00:11:26 coming in on a motorcycle and of course that's where the advent children, flippy fucking motorcycle
00:11:32 sword fights have to start and I'm just watching the scene.
00:11:35 I'm in it and I'm going oh my god you were doing so well but Square Enix just can't help
00:11:39 themselves.
00:11:40 Nomura couldn't help himself.
00:11:42 They had to create this guy and stick him in here unnecessarily just, and he's just,
00:11:48 and this guy starts talking.
00:11:50 The fucking words.
00:11:51 I mean you said no anime dialogue but then this guy shows up and the words that come
00:11:55 out of this guy, it's like he's from a different game.
00:11:58 It's like every other character is in a totally different game and the dialogue is actually
00:12:02 decent and good.
00:12:04 And then this guy comes in like he came in from the crisis core universe.
00:12:08 He found a wormhole and found his way into this game and instantly the quality of the
00:12:13 whole thing nose dives immediately and he just starts talking in poetry and he starts
00:12:18 talking like Genesis like quoting plays and sonnets and shit and he's going oh the flames
00:12:23 of our rivalry shall burn forever.
00:12:25 I can't wait to have sword fights forever.
00:12:29 You're my fated rival because everyone is gay for each other.
00:12:32 Let's be gay for each other and let's scissor, let's have a nice motorcycle scissor sword
00:12:37 fight.
00:12:38 I'm so happy to have found my fated rival in this world.
00:12:41 The dying embers of my heart, my romance and my passion and I'm like what happened?
00:12:46 In five minutes the game went from the most incredible thing, like all my dreams came
00:12:51 true to then all my nightmares have come true like right one after another.
00:12:57 Hold on just a second.
00:12:59 That sounds like it was tongue in cheek.
00:13:02 Did Cloud give a shit about this guy?
00:13:04 No, Cloud rightfully hated him and wanted nothing to do with him.
00:13:08 Thank God for that.
00:13:09 But just like the fact that this character exists and like they just had to-
00:13:12 Yeah, you've got to think that like this is what Nomura considered like worthy of an
00:13:16 addition to the tapestry that is the story of like this guy who's just basically like
00:13:22 a Genesis character like you said.
00:13:24 He's extremely similar to Genesis and he has equally advent children moves.
00:13:28 I mean these are just all the elements that I don't know about everybody else but I hope
00:13:31 to see very little of and to have more of just the other stuff.
00:13:35 And the thing is, it's like I get the idea behind this character and it's not even a
00:13:42 bad idea like you see him and they go-
00:13:45 Do you see a soldier who's like not-
00:13:47 Yes, a soldier.
00:13:48 That's good.
00:13:49 That's good stuff.
00:13:50 Oh, he's a soldier and you read his bio.
00:13:51 He's like a soldier third class and like he's got like the suspenders and the outfit and
00:13:56 it's like it is a legitimately good idea to like expand in little ways like having another
00:14:03 soldier to be like a rival to Cloud throughout the game.
00:14:07 That's cool.
00:14:08 That's great.
00:14:09 Why do they have to be this?
00:14:10 You know, I've got a nuanced point and I'm making a video about this.
00:14:16 I'm about 18 hours into the game.
00:14:18 I am blasting through this thing.
00:14:19 I'm going to be done with it soon and I have so much to say about it in one maybe more
00:14:23 videos, I don't know.
00:14:24 But about this character, there's a moment later when, okay, you know when you meet Reno,
00:14:29 when you arrive in Eris's whatever, you crash through the ceiling of the church and whatever
00:14:35 and Reno's there.
00:14:36 Reno had a fascinating point of dialogue that in retrospect, like this is a moment that
00:14:40 I think the remake is like literally better in the- because there's like additional levels
00:14:45 of expressiveness it can do and it's that specifically Reno says like, who are you?
00:14:50 Cloud says, ex-soldier.
00:14:51 Reno's like, really?
00:14:52 What class?
00:14:53 And Cloud says, first class.
00:14:56 Reno, when hearing, and maybe this was in the original, I'm going to replay it to double
00:14:59 check.
00:15:00 Reno like laughs and is like, bro, like it's obviously a joke that you're a first class
00:15:05 soldier.
00:15:06 Like I can tell you're not that powerful or something.
00:15:08 What that did for me was make me be like, oh, you know what this is doing all at once?
00:15:13 What it's doing is it is throwing into question like the validity of Cloud's story in a very
00:15:18 reasonable way that characters who like, who are in the know would actually be able
00:15:22 to like, with a degree of authority on the matter, like question specific elements of
00:15:28 Cloud's story, especially considering we have already met a soldier third class.
00:15:33 Like I know it's no more of stuff.
00:15:34 And like that guy seems barely more powerful than or like Cloud seems like only a bit stronger
00:15:39 than that guy.
00:15:40 Now there is issues with this because like Cloud is doing literal advent children shit
00:15:44 that like no one has ever done in the history of the world.
00:15:48 So it doesn't the power scaling does not really make sense once that stuff has been included.
00:15:53 But I mean, combat was always kind of an abstraction.
00:15:55 I'm guessing they're continuing that with like the cutscene combat as well.
00:15:58 I don't know.
00:16:00 But like that's a moment that they've taken what already exists and just added a little
00:16:05 bit of extra detail.
00:16:06 Yeah.
00:16:07 And they're making a lot of story more like I'm shocked at how the only point I wanted
00:16:12 to get about that.
00:16:13 And it was just that the issue about that is that the game is already like everything
00:16:18 I said just there is set up for the mystery of who is Cloud?
00:16:22 Like what is his backstory?
00:16:24 That's all those points I just said are adding to that mystery that was in the original.
00:16:28 The problem is that mystery itself is not maintained in this remake in the same way
00:16:34 it was in the original, which leads me to believe they don't understand what they're
00:16:39 doing with these additional details.
00:16:42 They are just putting new things in.
00:16:44 Some of them hit the mark, but they shatter the illusion in this game, which is supposed
00:16:49 to be the first fifth or sixth of the fucking game where that information is not supposed
00:16:53 to be known yet.
00:16:55 So like ultimately, what was the point of it?
00:16:57 It's such a fucking one foot one step forward.
00:17:00 How is the mystery revealed?
00:17:03 I mean, I don't want to spoil it for you.
00:17:04 I'm aware what like they you are very cleanly aware it is stated to you that cloud is not
00:17:10 a soldier.
00:17:11 This piece of my worry of that is that I mean, like I'm at the point now we're like because
00:17:19 it's so clear that they did actually give a shit more than I gave them credit for, you
00:17:23 know, or more than I assumed they would like, I'm shocked at how many little things there
00:17:28 are like that Reno line you mentioned where it's just like, oh, this is like a good addition
00:17:31 to the canon.
00:17:32 Like I like this more of this please.
00:17:35 And like just little moments where like things are expanded or like are touched upon.
00:17:40 I'm shocked at how much there's that that I like I guess my worry is that they're going
00:17:45 to cram all the character development into this first game.
00:17:48 And then what the fuck do you do for the next, you know, five games, bro, they've got no
00:17:52 plan.
00:17:53 Yeah, they've got no plan.
00:17:54 It just seems like they're really I can feel how the story is set up in this one that they're
00:17:58 kind of rushing through these character beats that, you know, in the original game throughout
00:18:03 the whole game.
00:18:04 I mean, that's definitely true.
00:18:06 I mean, Sephiroth's appearance after the first fucking mission could could not be clear as
00:18:11 to exact.
00:18:12 Oh my God, Jesse, the thing that maybe the most angry, I wonder if you I don't know if
00:18:16 you also noticed that I mean, it's very clear in the story, but it made me this is the moment
00:18:21 I was like these people are fucking up blowing up their own reactor.
00:18:25 Yes, it's the chin.
00:18:26 Are you kidding me?
00:18:29 Are you fine?
00:18:30 You're rewriting Avalanche's role in the story.
00:18:33 That is the worst change in the game so far.
00:18:45 You mentioned that and flip shit because I played the demo a couple of weeks ago.
00:18:48 I know you guys didn't and to make it clear for everybody in the audience, I've never
00:18:52 played Final Fantasy 7 and I haven't on purpose.
00:18:55 I want to play the remake without the perspective of all the baggage that you guys have just
00:18:59 just as an experiment.
00:19:01 And so I play the demo and I did a podcast on it and I specifically mentioned that scene.
00:19:04 I was like, I am 99% certain this is an addition to the remake and was not the original game.
00:19:10 You don't have to be a nostalgia fag.
00:19:12 You just have to have a functional fucking brain.
00:19:13 Because it just felt so fucking like the lot.
00:19:15 If we can't have the main characters be underwritten terrorists anymore, even though the whole point
00:19:19 is that they have an arc and they learn their lesson, they change people.
00:19:22 Later on, fucking like Jesse's arc is like feeling guilt about the terrorist things they
00:19:27 caused.
00:19:28 So like, oh my God, on the one side, we get our characters feeling guilty about the collateral
00:19:33 damage.
00:19:34 And on the other side, from a meta perspective, we're aware that they're pure as the fucking
00:19:38 driven snow and they have nothing to feel bad about.
00:19:41 They literally did nothing wrong.
00:19:43 And you like other characters in this remake?
00:19:45 I don't know if you saw this line.
00:19:47 There's a line about, look, whatever, there's like before Crisis Shit about how Avalanche
00:19:51 is like a large organization and just barrets like Cell of Avalanche that was never clearly
00:19:55 raised in all but whatever.
00:19:58 It's before Crisis Bullshit.
00:19:59 They expand it in like some side games.
00:20:00 Yeah, it's in the Jesse mission and suddenly there's like other Avalanche cells that come
00:20:04 out to like, apparently they have some rivalry with you because like, oh, they don't like
00:20:08 the way we do things.
00:20:09 Like, what are you talking about?
00:20:10 What is this?
00:20:11 Dude, they say, this is the fucking, this is the thing.
00:20:13 Those other ones are like paramilitary organizations.
00:20:16 But Barrett Cell is specifically called like, they're ostracized because they're too radical
00:20:22 is what they say.
00:20:23 And yet, we're shown that like, no, they're actually all good, like they would never hurt
00:20:27 anybody.
00:20:28 And so how is Barrett Cell, how is it, how are they also the ones who are too radical
00:20:33 and also the ones who are like understaffed and like have no weapons and no money?
00:20:37 It doesn't make sense.
00:20:38 It makes no sense.
00:20:39 Like the whole point of them is that they have nothing.
00:20:40 They're like a startup.
00:20:41 And the worst thing about it, maybe the worst thing about it is how cucked Barrett and our
00:20:46 Avalanche guys are by being shown to be so ineffectual, even when they are able to like
00:20:52 do a little terrorism.
00:20:53 The bomb does nothing and they're robbed of all agency in the story.
00:20:57 The implication in the original game, in fact, I think they even flat out state this, when
00:21:01 you go to Cosmo Canyon, Barrett went to Cosmo Canyon as a young man early on and that's where
00:21:05 he got the idea to form Avalanche.
00:21:08 It is a grassroots organization that came up from the slums of poverty.
00:21:13 It is not a paramilitary, you know, coalition that spans the globe and has access to God.
00:21:19 It is now.
00:21:20 So like, I think there was a line in the original where Jesse is like, oh, I think the blasting
00:21:26 agent was too powerful.
00:21:27 I think I made it too powerful by mistake.
00:21:29 You know, so that was in there, but at least it was still her mistake.
00:21:33 It was her, you know, like they still did it.
00:21:36 They're still culpable for killing all these people and blowing up the reactor.
00:21:40 And now like that line is still in there in the new one.
00:21:43 In fact, they make a whole side vision audit of her like, oh, I got to go get a weaker
00:21:47 blasting agent because I feel guilty.
00:21:48 Okay.
00:21:49 Well, you feel guilty, but we're going to find out later.
00:21:51 You didn't even do it.
00:21:52 It's not even your fault.
00:21:53 You did nothing wrong.
00:21:54 So what's the point?
00:21:55 And then she's a waifu, Jesse.
00:21:57 She's not allowed to do anything.
00:21:58 She's not allowed to have any character.
00:22:00 She's there to be sexualized and observed for us.
00:22:03 That's her only role.
00:22:04 That's all that these characters exist for.
00:22:06 And then like, and then there's the part where, like I started out praising it.
00:22:10 Now like now that I think about it, you know, it's like you start thinking about it and
00:22:13 then you get more into what you hate about it.
00:22:15 Like the part where, you know, there's this slightly clumsy bit of dialogue where Tifa
00:22:20 says she feels trapped and she only says that so that later cloud can have his flashback
00:22:25 of her as a kid's thing.
00:22:26 If I'm ever trapped or in danger, you'll come save me.
00:22:30 And it's like that whole scene where she's going like, oh, I just feel trapped in this.
00:22:35 I don't, I don't like what we're doing.
00:22:37 We're, we're going too far, you know, you know, the other characters like Jesse has
00:22:41 a line where she's like, oh, Tifa's heart's not really in it.
00:22:44 And it's like Tifa in the original game was a vengeful fucking rage fuel.
00:22:49 She hated Shinra.
00:22:50 Remember how they killed her family and village and, you know, her famous line when her like
00:22:54 dad is dying in the maker reactor is like, I hate Shinra.
00:22:59 I hate Mako.
00:23:00 I hate soldier.
00:23:01 I hate them all.
00:23:02 No, no, no, no.
00:23:03 She's a delicate flower, Jesse.
00:23:05 She's not allowed to be a to have anger in her heart.
00:23:08 She has to be pure.
00:23:09 Our thighs are too thin.
00:23:12 They are too thin.
00:23:13 It's little too small at times.
00:23:16 Hey, I've got, I do want to say that I do agree with your initial sentiment.
00:23:21 There's a lot of good stuff.
00:23:22 And let me say two moments.
00:23:23 I cried at exactly one time, exactly one time out of pure emotion.
00:23:28 And it was, this is, it was like the shortest scene ever, but this is always fucking, okay,
00:23:33 you go through the bombing mission at the beginning, right?
00:23:35 And like Barrett's such a fucking asshole piece of shit.
00:23:37 When you get home after that mission, Barrett walks in the door and Marlene runs to him.
00:23:42 I fucking burst into fucking tears.
00:23:44 I've never felt anything more.
00:23:46 Barrett and Marlene are the best part of this fucking game.
00:23:49 And you know what's sad?
00:23:50 They cut out like tons of their fucking scenes.
00:23:52 We don't even get to see them together most of the time because we've changed how the
00:23:55 story, whatever.
00:23:56 I mean, that's a, that's a nitpick, but I fucking love Marlene and she doesn't have
00:23:59 enough of a presence.
00:24:00 For my taste.
00:24:01 There's so much good in it.
00:24:02 But I just know that everything good in it is going to be sabotaged by something else
00:24:05 in it.
00:24:06 That's shitty.
00:24:07 You know, like, I love that.
00:24:08 Like, I love how they, like, they took so much care and attention to detail on certain
00:24:14 things.
00:24:15 Like they even remembered like a minor character like Johnny.
00:24:17 He's in the game for like a little, like I was like, oh my God, I can't believe it.
00:24:21 That's really cool.
00:24:23 But I just know he's going to come back later.
00:24:25 Yeah, he's going to come back later and fuck Tifa in front of you or something.
00:24:30 How exciting.
00:24:32 I was reading a little bit of developer commentary about like the original stuff and Johnny was
00:24:36 like in the original.
00:24:37 So there's another thing going on here.
00:24:40 Johnny was originally planned to have a larger role in the original game.
00:24:44 Okay, they couldn't add that due to like time or like things didn't work out.
00:24:48 But now that there's a remake, they like take that opportunity to expand that role.
00:24:53 I have mixed feelings about that because like, I mean, I won't get into the big spoilers
00:24:58 later.
00:24:59 But like whatever your plans were when you made a game originally, like I love the game
00:25:04 that you did make.
00:25:06 I don't love this game that exists in Nomura's mind that he wish he had made, you know, 23
00:25:11 years ago or whatever.
00:25:12 I don't know about that game.
00:25:13 I don't care about that game.
00:25:15 So that is no, that does not affect me in any justification that like, oh, new bad things
00:25:20 are in because they were planned to be in the original doesn't matter.
00:25:23 Not important.
00:25:24 Don't care.
00:25:25 But, you know, speaking of coloring good things with bad stuff, there was another scene
00:25:31 I really loved.
00:25:32 Really my other favorite part of the game.
00:25:34 And it was just in the original after you save Eris from Reno and you escape, you run
00:25:39 across the rooftops.
00:25:40 I got to that scene in this game.
00:25:42 It's much longer as, excuse me, everything in this game takes a million times longer,
00:25:47 which is kind of annoying.
00:25:48 But it's just a simple scene of you and Eris walking along rooftops, getting to know each
00:25:53 other, kind of bonding and doing all that stuff.
00:25:57 And that scene was charming and delightful and was absolutely beautiful.
00:26:02 That was like the time I took the most time to just observe how amazing this game looks
00:26:07 and how, I mean, to be, to simply be able to pan the camera up and see the underside
00:26:14 of the MiGar plates.
00:26:16 That's like the point where I like, where I was like standing in front of the bar and
00:26:19 I was like looking around my surroundings and just taking it in and just like looking
00:26:22 up and seeing the fucking pizza in the sky.
00:26:26 And like the parts where it's unfinished and the sunlight is coming through, I'm just
00:26:29 like, it looks beautiful.
00:26:31 It looks so good.
00:26:32 Hell yeah.
00:26:33 There are some people out there who are shitting on it because like a lot of the, I don't
00:26:36 know if you've noticed, a lot of the textures and background images are extremely grainy
00:26:40 and...
00:26:41 Yeah, that's something that only the nerd would notice.
00:26:43 I don't fucking give a shit.
00:26:44 I have noticed, but I don't really give a shit.
00:26:45 I mean, like the original game was like programmed to the box of matches, so.
00:26:50 I would argue that while this game...
00:26:51 Because together with Scotch tape and thumbtacks.
00:26:53 I mean, that's true.
00:26:54 Since this game is trying to create a, as I said in my video years ago, a more complex
00:26:58 illusion.
00:26:59 Any breaks stand out more and are more jarring, but I mean, you know, whatever, who really
00:27:03 gives a shit.
00:27:04 I love the gameplay.
00:27:05 I don't know.
00:27:06 Like it feels good to fight.
00:27:07 I love the little additions, like being able to level up the buster sword so that I can
00:27:11 keep using it throughout the game if I feel like, instead of like immediately having to
00:27:14 switch it out.
00:27:15 That's cool.
00:27:16 Yeah.
00:27:17 That's a nice feature.
00:27:18 That's a nice feature.
00:27:19 I mean, I don't know.
00:27:20 I love seeing the material on Tifa's gauntlet and cutscenes and like...
00:27:26 I gotta say, I've always wanted more of that shit and it looks really cool.
00:27:33 As a tech demo of Final Fantasy 7, I basically can have no complaints.
00:27:37 It's like the most amazing thing I've ever seen.
00:27:39 The one thing that I also do appreciate is that the game is literally called Final Fantasy
00:27:47 7 Remake.
00:27:49 It's on the box.
00:27:50 So there can be no believing that this is Final Fantasy 7 for anyone.
00:27:55 If you believe that it is, you're wrong and get out, except for the parts that I like
00:27:59 which are correct and good and it can't.
00:28:01 But all the parts that I like are not canon.
00:28:04 I mean...
00:28:05 That is a big thing, like calling it a remake.
00:28:07 One thing I've always hated, it just comes down to the Googling.
00:28:10 Like you Google the name of a thing, knowing that there is an original and a remake that
00:28:15 is exactly the same thing and you come up with like the thing you don't want every time.
00:28:21 You have to clarify and it's just annoying.
00:28:22 Good thing you don't have to type Final Fantasy 7 2020 or whatever to distinguish it.
00:28:28 Yeah, Sonic 06 and whatever.
00:28:31 Yeah, there's a lot to say about this game.
00:28:35 We'll all keep coming back to say more about this game until we've all beaten it.
00:28:39 And then for years after.
00:28:40 I just found it on Target.com and ordered it.
00:28:43 It'll be here in a few days and I'll be able to weigh in on it more next week.
00:28:47 There you go.
00:28:48 Hell yeah.
00:28:50 Presuming that the rest of this game and the following games in the Final Fantasy 7 Remake
00:28:56 series are of a similar ratio of new good shit and new bad shit, would you recommend assuming
00:29:09 that is what you've played so far?
00:29:12 The thing about that is you are not allowed to publicly state your opinion of this game
00:29:18 as a remake until you have beaten it.
00:29:20 You're just not allowed.
00:29:22 Jesse you have to beat this game before you because the things that happen I mean are
00:29:27 just a note of note until somebody says yeah, play it because I have no real burning desire
00:29:35 to play Final Fantasy 7 again.
00:29:38 It was a good time but like I need to know like I need someone I trust to say yes, please.
00:29:44 I mean I feel a little bit raped because I never had an option but to play this game.
00:29:49 It literally I had no choice.
00:29:51 I had to do it, I've been abused and all I'm saying is.
00:29:57 It was like being drawn to the Earth Crater.
00:29:59 It's in my DNA.
00:30:00 Reunion had to happen.
00:30:01 It's what this is reunion.
00:30:02 That's right.
00:30:03 Oh Lord.
00:30:04 This really is reunion.
00:30:06 Is this a meta commentary Nomura?
00:30:08 Are you trying to...
00:30:09 He's made our lives Final Fantasy 7.
00:30:12 That's the real trick to all of it.
00:30:15 Playing the original infected us with Jenova cells and they're just trying to...
00:30:19 How likely is it that the ending is going to be like explicit one way or the other what
00:30:24 happened?
00:30:25 What happened with what?
00:30:26 Well you know at the very end there's the last cutscene where it's like it cuts to like
00:30:30 years in the future and you don't really know whether they survived or what happened
00:30:33 exactly.
00:30:34 Oh God.
00:30:35 No.
00:30:36 Well first of all there's...
00:30:37 I can't say anything.
00:30:40 But I don't fucking know.
00:30:43 I do know.
00:30:44 Can I make him explode?
00:30:45 I'm going to explode.
00:30:46 I do like the Sephiroth dialogue more than I thought I would even though he's you know
00:30:52 shoehorned in way earlier than he should be.
00:30:54 I mean like obviously they could not keep him a surprise like he was in the original
00:30:59 game.
00:31:00 That's just something that they could not replicate.
00:31:02 So I guess I understand the reasoning of like I mean like if like who doesn't know
00:31:07 who Sephiroth is like who doesn't know that he exists.
00:31:10 But I mean by that logic Jesse I mean I get like I was talking with some people about
00:31:16 this.
00:31:17 Final Fantasy 7 is different from other remakes because this game is like mostly known specifically
00:31:22 for its story as opposed to other games.
00:31:25 It's like it's two different games because like there's so much of it that has so much
00:31:29 attention to detail and is so clearly trying to be like a one to one representation of
00:31:34 the original game that is exactly perfect and exactly right.
00:31:37 But then there's also completely new shit and rearranged shit and stuff that's like totally
00:31:42 off the wall zany.
00:31:43 And it's like how are both of these philosophies coexisting in the same game.
00:31:48 It's Namora right.
00:31:49 That's what I would assume.
00:31:51 Yeah.
00:31:52 It's pretty clear.
00:31:53 Short hand answer for everything.
00:31:54 They just felt they needed filler and you know there's some sections of the filler that
00:31:57 I don't love at all.
00:31:59 I can't help as a guy who played the original but be aware every moment of every mission
00:32:04 that I'm like like this game is just wasting my time in between story beats that I know
00:32:09 are there.
00:32:10 I did like the one line where Cloud like first sees this apparition of Sephiroth and he's
00:32:13 like oh I killed you and Sephiroth is like you did or something like that like oh you're
00:32:19 dead.
00:32:20 He goes that's it.
00:32:21 He goes you're dead and Sephiroth goes I am like fuck you buddy I'm right here motherfucker.
00:32:28 I wish that they would just go crazy with it and have them talk like an idiot like it's
00:32:32 me I'm fucking Sephiroth buddy fucker I'm right here you're here to fuck up your day
00:32:36 dude.
00:32:37 That'd be cool.
00:32:38 Yeah I mean.
00:32:39 Well I'm like I am you know I'm sure that they're going to go over the top with this
00:32:45 and make Sephiroth like totally gay for Cloud like they always do now whereas like in the
00:32:49 original game Sephiroth like didn't really give a fuck about Cloud at any point.
00:32:53 You know Sephiroth's first line in Final Fantasy 7 to Cloud on the SS Junon or whatever
00:32:58 the ship's called.
00:32:59 It's literally who are you.
00:33:01 Yeah that's his line to Cloud.
00:33:02 Cloud was literally just a grunt who got lucky.
00:33:05 He's not like Sephiroth's fated rival.
00:33:07 In what way is Cloud any more important than any of those shambling like empty husks of
00:33:12 clones.
00:33:13 He's not.
00:33:14 And that's like all Sephiroth's dialogue is like he keeps saying you're nothing you're
00:33:17 nobody special you're a puppet you're my little fucking meat puppet to do what I want
00:33:21 you suck you're not even cool bro that's this is the whole problem the meta has infected
00:33:26 the shit it's all about like destiny now and shit that's uh it's like.
00:33:31 We'll get there.
00:33:33 Hey what one other point I was I was saying how much I like that heiress like rooftop
00:33:37 exploring I just fucking hate modern games and how like you you know like you know those
00:33:43 little arrows that you walk up to so that they're like an automatic motion going down
00:33:48 a ladder takes like 10 fucking hours every time ever jumping across a little gap the
00:33:54 charm of seeing Cloud slowly balance across a fucking beam as he walks along is not enough
00:34:01 to justify how much of my time is being wasted in the reactor where it has that section it's
00:34:06 like okay you've got to run fast when the when the lasers are off and it's like yeah like
00:34:10 I couldn't do it because when you press run he doesn't immediately run he has to go into
00:34:14 his animation of like starting to run because it has to be like a realistic thing now and
00:34:20 it's like that kind of modern games design I hope there's not more of those fucking lasers
00:34:24 because that sucked I think the thing that felt really drawing to me playing the demo
00:34:28 at least was that like when you're not in combat like the controls are different you know like
00:34:33 because you can't like swing the sword really or do any of the like movement stuff that you do
00:34:37 in combat outside of it because in the original game you have overworld controls and then you're
00:34:42 in turn based combat and I know they're trying to replicate that but it's like at the laser part
00:34:46 I'm like man if I had my fucking dodge roll right now I could get through this a lot easier
00:34:50 you know I am I'm constantly pressing R2 to run not realizing there's still an enemy on the screen
00:34:57 and it goes into like the tactical menu and it's just like a little thing around every time I'm
00:35:01 like god damn it I wanted to run that's just another really annoying thing the way like one of the
00:35:06 reasons I love Kingdom Hearts 2 so much is that like you're you do the same things all the time
00:35:11 there's no like in combat you do different stuff the control scheme is consistent and when you use
00:35:16 like a dry form or whatever like all you do is you get new abilities you haven't lost anything
00:35:20 why that like that gets changed in Kingdom Hearts 3 where you just like swap out movesets
00:35:25 why do video games still have a dedicated run button when the analog stick has been around for
00:35:31 literally 20 years well it's a sprint button in this case but I'd get what you said why do that
00:35:37 like why bother like why not just I mean I would assume you know I mean I was thinking about this
00:35:42 the other day like like um you know you push the stick to move and like why is there a slow
00:35:48 movement like why do you have to get running shoes in Pokemon there's no reason to walk yeah um
00:35:53 but I I've realized that I mean in certain small situations certain smaller areas where you need to
00:36:01 walk a short distance between things you don't want to overshoot it all the time that's true being
00:36:06 able to walk is useful I would rather have a Tom's point about the analog stick solves that yeah if
00:36:10 you just tilt it a little bit as opposed to the thing it's it's it's easier to just push the
00:36:16 direction all the way than it is to like but like it's not like it's not like daintily in the remake
00:36:20 you have because you're always gonna want to the thing is like in the remake you it's not like
00:36:24 you're running you're walking and running it's that you're running and then running a little bit
00:36:28 faster I mean that's it's very strange hey you know the only game the only game I recall that is silly
00:36:35 that did this well I was playing for my banjo video I was playing a little game called banjo
00:36:39 twoy in order to get this one jiggy there's a sleeping plant that you got to like really slow
00:36:45 creep up on for like an extended period of time and it was actually I was playing on an emulator
00:36:49 and it was like it was like literally impossible I had to remap the entire controller to get it to
00:36:53 work I was looking around apparently that's like a very common issue with that sequence of the game
00:36:58 but yeah you walk slow which is a little creepo sneak no noise animation you get the jiggy and
00:37:03 I was like this is the best game ever banjo twoy remake featuring genesis remember when uh in the
00:37:12 banjo twoy remake gruntilda came down and said uh banjo I will never be a memory I shall give you
00:37:19 despair banjo I loved that oh god the fucking the literal feathers that cloud keeps seeing
00:37:26 oh enough with the literal feathers I hate birds I hate birds man I hate birds the fucking wing
00:37:35 shit is this I hate it I've always hated it I'll always hate it you didn't have a fucking wing
00:37:42 one winged angel is not a literal fucking aspect of his character it's like a metaphorical it sounds
00:37:47 spooky like name of his fucking theme song he doesn't have to have a fucking wing I just like
00:37:52 the point it again sephiroth was literally never a one winged angel even in the original game what
00:37:58 he had was one arm got replaced with a wing when he turned into safer sephiroth for one fight and
00:38:04 that became he was like a weird judaeo christian like 15 winged angel yeah and it was fucking
00:38:10 based it was fucking sick why doesn't he turn to that instead of pull out his wing all the time
00:38:14 safer sephiroth fucking ruled but uh fucking whatever fucking new sephiroth always pulling
00:38:20 out his wing when no one wants to see it stupid ass I hate no thing but a chicken wing I'm gonna
00:38:29 fry that chicken wing sephiroth anyway Jesse you gotta let me know when you beat this game I would
00:38:34 I'm very eager to hear what you think you should do a video like a double I I've been recording
00:38:40 all my gameplay so I that's no doubt do something with it I I've been doing the PlayStation when I
00:38:46 see something happen that I'm like oh that made me smile and then I see another and I'm like oh
00:38:51 that made me fall into deep depression yeah do a snap that little shit thanks PlayStation for the
00:38:57 players speaking of speaking of PlayStation games I've been playing a better game than Final Fantasy
00:39:05 impossible uh Ratchet and Clank 2 I've been streaming it non-stop every single day I love
00:39:11 Ratchet and Clank 2 how's that going yeah it's going great I for the first time I've decided to 100
00:39:18 percent complete it doing all of the the special skill point things and and uh you know there's a
00:39:24 lot of secret shit in those games a lot of good stuff to find yeah I mean like compared to modern
00:39:28 games there's not like hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of millions of like checklists like
00:39:33 get 100 well yeah uh fucking it's what's known as a good game not a bad game yes it's a game that
00:39:39 has the no fluff in it and everything is good um and the combat's great and I've just been I've
00:39:46 had in the time of my life playing old video games hey why would you why would you ever need to play
00:39:51 a new video game what is the why do people spend money when Ratchet and Clank 2 already exists
00:39:56 because people don't want to spend time uh like analyzing what game would actually be like most
00:40:02 satisfying or enjoyable for them they just want the zeitgeist to present them with a new thing
00:40:07 to get on board with which I don't blame them for I mean people love being part of the zeitgeist
00:40:12 we were talking about that a few episodes ago like yeah people just love to be in the know
00:40:18 even if they don't give a shit or maybe it wasn't on the episode I was talking about this on
00:40:22 my stream on GibbonGaming.com youtube.com slash Gibbon Gaming where you can go and watch all
00:40:28 those streams they're all titled the same because I don't care and it's it's hard to understand
00:40:33 which part comes first um but um like the the the idea that um people will get into media more
00:40:43 so to be part of a conversation than they would to like enrich their lives or entertain themselves
00:40:49 uh like generally speaking if there's a new thing and everyone's talking about it you're like well
00:40:55 I I guess I should and you do it even though there's better things that you could be doing
00:41:01 and you know there are there's always like a big backlog of like the greatest things ever made
00:41:05 that you haven't got around to yet but it's not it's not culturally relevant right now
00:41:10 that sucks to give people to give people a little bit of credit like it's not purely malicious at
00:41:14 least from the consumer side because a lot of people they're just they just you know things are
00:41:18 just presented and they're like yeah sure okay I mean I'll watch that so it's not you know it's
00:41:24 just a product of the way we live I just like you know there's been like um some reservation uh of
00:41:33 like playing the same game over and over again forever like I only play like 20 games and they're
00:41:39 all ps2 games and then sometimes it's Dark Souls it's like I I'm I'm missing out on all of these
00:41:46 great experiences but I'm also having a lot of fun and I don't really care so I don't know how to
00:41:51 feel about it hmm yeah I don't know everyone's just got to decide how they want to live and what
00:41:57 they want to do you know there's nothing wrong with playing the same game over and over your whole
00:42:02 life because I mean you know how much will your life real will your fucking soul level up if you
00:42:08 play more games versus playing the same games to a degree sure it'll give you more experience
00:42:14 but these things are all fairly arbitrary in what you do with your life anyways I was just
00:42:18 thinking about it because it's like if you personally are bored then obviously try something new
00:42:23 um yep but like I just am able I mean I can't play the same game like multiple times in a row
00:42:30 all the way through but there's a health there's like a enough games in my like nostalgia rotation
00:42:35 I can just sort of loop back around and doing doing you know I played Okami recently yeah
00:42:42 I told him I know you've beaten that I think I just did a few days ago it was fucking sick
00:42:48 what do you think uh it was fucking great it's the best Zelda game ever made
00:42:53 because it's actually fun and not gay and formulaic and like it it obscures the formulaic nature of
00:42:59 the Zelda format in a way that's much more fun and you can like zendots things and slice them in
00:43:05 half and the brush techniques are all fucking lit the game looks gorgeous uh the puzzles aren't like
00:43:12 overly obtuse or annoying except for some of them what we need is an Okami remake in HD like you
00:43:18 know you know we just need to no no no I mean like we need to remake the game like fix the stuff that
00:43:23 was bad like the art style for example we need realism we need realism we got to get rid of
00:43:28 the game the game unironically was originally going to be a realistic style you go when you
00:43:32 beat the game you unlock the original alpha trailer and it was a realistic game yeah and then they
00:43:36 changed it at some point that is amazing I gotta go check that out sometime there was another
00:43:40 trailer that you unlock for beating the game where uh there's like another older build of the game
00:43:45 where the reflector that Amaterasu carries around is like a fucking cannon and you just like fight
00:43:50 all these other guys and blow shit up I was like I want to play this bill what the fuck that does
00:43:55 look sick and then if you dig back far enough you find the true alpha version of the game
00:43:59 simply known as road toads and things would just expand from there yeah think about it they're
00:44:05 very similar a little thing rides a bigger thing that moves it around how is that not road toads I
00:44:10 ask you it's the same game yeah you soon looked a little different in road toads it was a toad
00:44:16 it all worked out in the end yeah okami's great uh it's so good I loved it and uh I'm really mad
00:44:24 that I was 12 demon fangs away from s ranking the entire game without even realizing I had no
00:44:28 ideas being ranked on my performance could you not go back and just get those to achieve an s
00:44:32 rank perhaps I don't know well if you know the save file you probably can yeah but it's just like
00:44:40 the joy of like just accidentally s ranking the game on your first playthrough that makes sense
00:44:45 it's just this that serendipitous moment was just taken away from me and uh I'll never forgive myself
00:44:50 for such dismal failure alas alas there's so many fun ways to play a game speed running trying to s
00:44:57 rank everything I don't know just being a yeah I feel like idiot not even beating the story playing
00:45:03 playing a game over and over again I think it's like a precursor to trying to speed run it like I
00:45:08 tried to speed run retching clank 2 to get to the new game plus where like the game is actually
00:45:14 a lot better because they have the bolt multiplier yeah if you if you don't get hit you can multiply
00:45:19 the bolts you get and you get times 20 and then you get a load of money and then you're rich and
00:45:24 buy loads of guns um but like speed running is hard and I couldn't do it but I did manage to beat
00:45:31 the whole game like in six hours on stream so that's not bad wait okami no no no retching
00:45:37 clank 2 and I got to the new game plus and I've been streaming that at a reasonable pace getting
00:45:42 all the skill points uh yeah I'm thinking of doing like once I've done that I'll do retching
00:45:48 clank 3 do the exact same thing and then I'll do jack and dexter jack 2 jack 3 and then slide 2
00:45:54 slide 3 and I'll just be like a playstation stream boy hell yeah it's it's it's the perfect
00:46:00 version of like what hypocrites should have been it's not like hypocrite was just my excuse to play
00:46:06 these games again and analyze them and figure out why why they're so cool and explain to people
00:46:12 why they're cool but I realized while streaming that I can do that analysis on the fly with examples
00:46:18 so it's it's just a lot easier to just play the game and then say oh this bit this is right
00:46:22 and here's why uh and then like oh this part is bullshit and here's why although I do go on a lot
00:46:28 of like um angry rants when it's not actually bullshit uh because I'm like a rager I'm like a
00:46:34 rage gamer I'm a big rage quit guy and I love that about myself it's the coolest thing about me
00:46:40 is that I rage quit things and I and I say no I respect it greatly it's fucking cool yeah
00:46:49 that's sick dude that's sick you should title them slightly more and uh informationally so that
00:46:55 anyone can discern one from the other just a little you should title them less informationally you
00:46:59 should title them like just like strings of shit you should title them uh in some way so that when
00:47:05 I go to your homepage the names form like some ascii art thing that I can you know put the pieces
00:47:11 it's like a big smiley face you should just title them video game one video game two video game
00:47:17 footage just no parts just video game every single video human person plays video game on stream
00:47:26 yeah but he's also sounds great god I I want to be done with this fucking remake so bad I
00:47:35 want to just set me free I've got probably 10 hours to go at least oh god I'm at the uh I'm at
00:47:42 the pillar falling part right now when I was going down you know I started playing like a second run
00:47:48 of resident evil 3 right before like this came out yeah because like and like like you said like
00:47:54 you play it more and you get faster at it it's like a precursor to the speed running so like I'm
00:47:59 playing at the second time and realizing that like I complained about it being too short originally
00:48:04 it's even shorter than I thought now that I know where everything is I'm just like I'm done with it
00:48:09 in five minutes then I'm like and I'm like oh my god should I play it again to get this stupid
00:48:14 like extra knife and this stupid unlimited sorry if I don't even want it I don't even want to like
00:48:18 what is the point of these of these power-ups for a game I don't even want to play anymore I'm just
00:48:22 like by the end of it I was like please Final Fantasy 7 remake deliver me from this set me free
00:48:27 from resident evil 3 even if you're bad so is there any upside to playing it again have you
00:48:34 discovered any joys you missed no it was bullshit they gave you like you get like store points to
00:48:39 like buy like these meaningless upgrades but all the upgrades suck and the one that I bought was like
00:48:45 for like 7 000 points it's like a hot knife and it's like oh this sick yeah this hot knife
00:48:52 this hot knife will carve through but zombies like fucking butter yeah bro speaking of speaking of
00:48:59 store points uh have you seen this shit by any chance have you uh uh you better need not lay a
00:49:05 finger on my butter finger says cloud strife in canon of Final Fantasy 7 remake by two participating
00:49:12 products upload your receipt and score unique dlc for the Final Fantasy 7 remake an exclusive ps4
00:49:17 dynamic theme container I saw an image of this I thought it was a joke it was just an image of
00:49:22 you get dlc bro finger next to him as much as I can see cloud being a butter finger guy I don't
00:49:29 approve of this anyways he's just sort of like staring at you like you're gonna buy one it's
00:49:36 just his default art from like the fucking by the and jesse jesse I don't know if this perplexes you
00:49:42 for decades I have been continually vexed by the fact that every fucking incarnation of cloud
00:49:49 strife has his fucking uniform a different color yes is it purple is it blue is it black he
00:49:56 literally looks black here in the game he usually looks blue sometimes it's a little purple just
00:50:01 making purple it's like it's like there are times when like the lighting you look at it like oh I
00:50:06 guess that almost kind of looks purple or blue baby but then the rest of the time it looks black
00:50:11 depend you know it's like just settle on a color just make it purple it was always purple the original
00:50:17 purple is an unrealistic color jesse it's not too unrealistic we can't have that in the game it's
00:50:22 that's hokey 90s purple it's not purple it's just so fucking unrealistic but that spiky hair that
00:50:28 defies gravity that's the realism I want to go back to the 90s I miss when things were colorful
00:50:33 and fun and cool what happened it wasn't even like downplayed purple or cloth purple it was just
00:50:41 bright one solid brick of a color purple the whole game no matter what the lighting was inside
00:50:46 outside didn't matter always so retarded that you had a main character just wearing this giant
00:50:51 purple fucking jumpsuit I fucking loved it uh you know what gives me like more joy I'll just
00:50:57 be walking along and in the distance I will see it's almost like character designs like standing
00:51:01 out and being cool like is good in a video game I just see the little bit of it's it's this it's
00:51:06 this one thing the red on Tifa's gloves I don't know why I get such emotional comfort by seeing
00:51:14 that there's like some color on Tifa's design yes it's just that beautiful red color everything
00:51:19 else is like realistic and gritty and like low color but the bright red they toned it down too
00:51:24 there used to be more but just something about that it makes me happy imagine imagine it's like
00:51:31 Naruto with this big orange jumpsuit it was like remade and he had like a like a light brown
00:51:36 sort of like a leather coat remakes her mistake bro remakes like oh it's more realistic he blends
00:51:42 in the dark he's like no Naruto is stupid he needs to be he's a fucking idiot that that it forms
00:51:49 his character almost that he's so stupid that he wears yeah that's a question yellow that's a
00:51:54 thing to ponder does cloud wearing purple do anything for his character well and not really
00:52:02 not really know although it's always been weird to me that okay just in the even in the original
00:52:07 we see other soldiers specifically only they are like enemies in battle sometimes you will
00:52:12 occasionally fight like soldier third class soldier second class maybe even first class I
00:52:17 can't remember or not if those are an enemy somewhere they they're wearing like blue and
00:52:21 red if I remember you like never see another purple wearing soldier except for Zach so I did I
00:52:28 don't know did cloud steal his clothes why is what is Zach wear purple I don't know uh like
00:52:33 that's one of those things that's like that's a detail that's in his head I assume that's the
00:52:39 I just assume that like if it is like a part of his memory is like uh Zach likes purple and then
00:52:45 so cloud also does maybe well it seems like the the soldier's first class we're just told look
00:52:51 there's kind of a uniform that you can wear but you can pretty much dress however the hell you
00:52:56 want Sephiroth you can get away with with dressing like a outer space biker I don't give a shit you
00:53:03 know which is cool yeah I mean that that would make sense to me it's just that I mean guys guys
00:53:07 guys we need to make a remake to answer this question why the fuck uh okay you know what it
00:53:13 doesn't matter it's been retconned he literally wears blue now uh as did all the fucking soldiers
00:53:19 in crisis corps which thank god that game came into existence and you know made Zach the literal
00:53:25 plot device that he was into the I do not understand why people love Zach so much I don't
00:53:30 fucking understand it I love Zach before you were fucking born you piece of shit and I loved him for
00:53:35 the right reasons yeah and in fact I loved him less when crisis corps came out because crisis corps
00:53:39 was lame and stupid and made because they flanderized him to fucking hell they made him like literally
00:53:44 Jesus and like angel wings and shit god it you look like you look like you're a guy who hates thing
00:53:52 when you have any kind of like criticism of thing and they like it's like oh we're the heroes man
00:53:58 we're the fucking heroes who want more good fucking what's his face being a god but no I
00:54:05 fuck you you're stupid if you like if you like crisis corps you are stupid what are you what are
00:54:09 you fucking hey hey guys what are you going on hashtag just slurping I got pasta remember remember
00:54:16 when you did that during the buster cast and all the half the comments are just like Ben why are you
00:54:20 doing I I did hear about that literally what one comment one comment was like wait a minute I
00:54:28 cannot listen to this because there's a yeah there are like two comments on that video when I look
00:54:32 at guys I've got I've got an update oh this is fascinating uh okay I was slightly wrong about
00:54:37 this I'm looking back at the enemy design of finalized seven characters and we can see because
00:54:42 there are soldier enemies that you fight in places you fight I found it at the very least
00:54:45 there's a soldier third class and a soldier first class that are like fodder enemies you know obviously
00:54:49 the first class is like a late game enemy or whatever are they like the soldier first classes
00:54:53 they do wear purple and brown boots exactly as cloud wears basically you're talking about the
00:54:57 file fancy seven original yeah here look at this look at this right here yeah but are those like
00:55:02 soldier or are all those like soldiers you know like this is a wikipedia entry for soldier first
00:55:08 as a soldier first class which you fight sector eight when you return to midgar later in the game
00:55:13 and there you fucking go it looks just like I mean they're a little darker but that's that's
00:55:16 clouds costume yeah that's fucking clouds outfit weird there you go that guy I yeah I don't remember
00:55:22 you do fight a couple of soldiers man I really like soldier soldier itself is one of the most
00:55:28 undeveloped fucking things in final fantasy seven and they thought that crisis core was like the
00:55:35 right way to flesh it out it was not it was not the right way to flesh it out uh they fucked it
00:55:40 like a daytime soap it was like the most homo erotic like weird pansy shit it was just like
00:55:47 this constant like like the whole the entire game soundtrack is just wonderwall being played
00:55:53 like drunkenly in the background while all these characters are soliloquizing that's that's that's
00:55:58 soliloquizing that's a word that's that's a sick remix of non non biori and wonderwall which I will
00:56:03 put in the links down below and you should listen to it because it's great uh every fine okay you
00:56:09 make a game everybody loves it then you make a sequel and you have to take the things that the
00:56:13 people loved and you make them like way more important than they ever were intended to be
00:56:19 originally because the meta has infected your story holy shit soliloquize is a word
00:56:25 soliloquize I knew I was fucking smart ah whatever soliloquize well it just sounded so wrong coming
00:56:35 out of me like I've never actually spoken the verb of soliloquy before hey you know what else
00:56:41 is beautiful I you remember the fucking hard edge remember the hard edge from final master seven
00:56:46 which is that weird ass fucking sword which is like a blunt tip yeah it kind of fans out and it's
00:56:50 got sick ass kanji on it that I don't know what it means but it's fucking cool that that hey guess
00:56:55 what that weapon it's in the game uh it's cool I love final fantasy seven uh just looking at it
00:57:00 makes me happy this whole game is kind of you know that really hd like incredibly sexy designed
00:57:06 that like some girl did of tifa that like leaked onto the internet somewhere as like her fucking
00:57:11 senior project that should have been this whole game one in the game I mean it's so much better I
00:57:15 mean it's incredibly hot it's pretty sexualized so I get why they wouldn't use it but like the whole
00:57:19 game has a lot of just that it's just that making things real making it amazing uh and making it
00:57:27 fucking 3d texture I can see the fabric like a little like
00:57:31 bestiary and like read about all the little enemies you fight and like the assessment area
00:57:36 being like more robust and like having little paragraphs just a little paragraph about everything
00:57:41 I fight is so cool and adds so much to it wait are you get do you guys think the final fantasy
00:57:47 seven remake is good we've been we've been debating that we amongst ourselves it is a very complicated
00:57:52 issue Ben I think even you Ben if you played it to simply be able to control okay after the
00:57:58 fucking two hours of mandatory scripted scenes of literally like not gameplay when you finally get
00:58:04 to like seventh heaven and you look around town you see tifa and you look up at the plates of
00:58:08 midgar and you're like holy shit they made this real it's like I think it's almost impossible to
00:58:13 not be stunned it's so good in every way except that it's filled with dumb bullshit that sucks
00:58:19 Ben I will be I would love to regale you with the tales of the massive failures of the game
00:58:24 you are telling me does not sound cool at all you really you think so yeah well if you if I like
00:58:32 fan art of things I like fan art of final fantasy seven I I enjoy such things as as fan art this
00:58:38 game is like the best fan art ever made I think we're just an agreement here that like just seeing
00:58:43 the stuff is in itself a cool experience but like there's an internal war going on inside me every
00:58:49 second I'm playing between what sucks and what's cool I don't want to be unfair and I even want to
00:58:54 give them credit that like a lot of it can be annoying and just gets in the way and I don't
00:58:58 think the dialogue is particularly well written overall but there are moments of just like chilling
00:59:03 in this world with like a little bit of ambient dialogue that does just make shit feel fucking
00:59:09 real like what I've always wanted the child I can't deny there are two wolves and one wolf
00:59:14 sucks and one wolf doesn't suck and which one is stronger is the one you feed one wolf is cringe
00:59:20 and the other is base exactly that's right and then they found it wrong I don't know I guess I'd
00:59:25 have to see it but I hope there's there's issues oh boy none of us have yet beaten the game so like
00:59:32 well I've heard and I've seen much of the the ending and what they do with it I'm waiting to see
00:59:38 sex bathtub scene I don't know yet I I don't want to spoil it but I mean well okay I'll just say
00:59:46 that's gone no that that's gone they cut that now there is other extremely homoerotic things
00:59:52 happening so like I'm sure many will be satisfied but that particular thing is not in the game
00:59:57 you know that's what I like I want I want good old-fashioned physical homoeroticism not lame
01:00:02 emotional homoeroticism like in crisis bro they've got the worst of all worlds they've got anime
01:00:06 homoeroticism I saw a clip or a gift or something of like going to like buy panties so that cloud
01:00:14 can be sexy for don something and he can wear this the women's underwear and it's like okay
01:00:20 lol you didn't do that there's definitely other stuff walking around a wall market in general
01:00:26 like again as a tech demo is like holy shit this is like this is amazing to see the fucking lights
01:00:33 and see Don Cornio's mansion and I don't know meet the amazing donut steel new OCs that have been
01:00:40 added I mean that part sucks but uh I don't know it's it there's so much going on in my brain
01:00:47 when I play this game it really is like very painful does does it feel like Final Fantasy 7
01:00:55 at times it really does at times it absolutely does at other times no at other times no it
01:01:01 does not um I mean we talked about it for a while but like when like there's a new soldier third
01:01:06 class guy who just comes in and is the most like advent children like retarded OC over the top crisis
01:01:13 core motherfucker that guy fucking sucks the fight with him was fun but you know the combat's a
01:01:19 separate thing that guy sucks uh was annoying oh and of course I mean they fucking introduced the
01:01:24 motorcycle chase stuff early on yeah man Final Fantasy 7 had so many like amazing one-off little
01:01:30 minigames yeah playing through that game is it's like holy shit like a new minigame just
01:01:35 unlike apropos fucking nothing it never uses the same trick like more times than it needs to
01:01:40 you know most of them it only happens once you know and if you want to do them again you go to the
01:01:44 yeah the gold saucer as a containment area for like replaying minigames you loved so cool just
01:01:50 snowboarding oh my god I love snowboarding in that fucking game yesterday could ever possibly imagine
01:01:54 because there's young which makes them automatically stupid and capable of forming thoughts but just
01:01:58 try you know to imagine you know you're playing a game and you think the game is just this for like
01:02:04 12 hours and then all of a sudden out of nowhere there's a crazy cool motorcycle chase that you've
01:02:09 never seen before in a video game in your life because it's a PlayStation one and the graphics
01:02:13 are mind-blowing to you and you know then you go out and you think like okay this whole game takes
01:02:17 place in a city and then you get out of the city and you go what the hell there's a whole planet
01:02:22 to explore what not in this game baby not in this fucking game there is one city to explore
01:02:29 you know I feel like a lot of people I'm definitely gonna talk about that when I make a video but
01:02:33 like I feel like a lot of people will say things like like okay modern games are filled with like
01:02:39 basically what you guys are describing here like like busy work and like side stuff you don't have
01:02:45 to do like I played darts in this game I thought that was pretty fun I enjoyed the little dart
01:02:50 minigame and I won and I got a little prize for it that was cool but I don't know it's I guess it's
01:02:55 hard to articulate but it's just a matter of like context it's probably the fact that like
01:03:00 Final Fantasy 7 as a game originally is so consistent in that there's like two modes of
01:03:05 operation you're running around talking to people or you're in combat it's super consistent
01:03:10 nothing any deviation from that felt like a side quest they were side quests the game was packed
01:03:17 with side quests but none of it felt like you're just going to some point on a map that says like
01:03:21 oh this activates a quest Jesse you tell me you tell me you enjoyed going to hunt those fucking rats
01:03:27 as a side mission in this game you can't you can't tell me you enjoyed that I actually like it forced
01:03:31 a laugh out of me like a like a snide contemptuous laugh because like it's so generic every RPG
01:03:37 you start out with a rat mission at the beginning like they had generic is the keyword yeah for these
01:03:42 additions and like oh don't you love meeting this amazing cast of characters of like nameless
01:03:49 shop owner number one yeah I don't know I didn't hate those you know there's a there's another big
01:03:53 veneer here and it's just another modern games thing I fucking hate voice acting I just want it
01:03:59 gone I just wanted gone from all games I don't give a fuck if you need voice acting to get attached
01:04:03 to a game it literally makes it worse because then I can hear these terrible English voice actors
01:04:08 just give me text I can fill in the blanks I don't need voices yeah when it when it's when it's
01:04:14 voice acting genuine question has voice acting ever made a game better well okay such a thing
01:04:20 is good performances do exist Metal Gear Solid okay it is a game famous for its voice actor
01:04:26 okay um I'll give you that one okay some games it makes sense other games it does not I would
01:04:33 argue that because this game has such a retarded story and has so many fucking weird stupid plot
01:04:39 details and they insist on shoving so many characters in our faith I have actually war
01:04:43 men or memories of many of like remember when cloud went into like in the sector seven slums
01:04:49 next to seventh heaven you walk into a house and there's like that section where it's like cloud
01:04:53 lecturing those guys on like how to fight like what combat is there's a lot of really funny
01:04:59 dialogue laced in there about cloud being cocky those guys being like teach a sensei like come on
01:05:03 bro teaches what to do as text I like all that stuff when it's voiced it feels forced and overdone
01:05:12 and annoying and I'm gonna I'm gonna disagree with you I I agree with the spirit of your argument
01:05:18 but but I think I'm in the camp of in this game so far I've thought I've been very very impressed
01:05:24 by the voice casting and acting and the dialogue I think it's all been really good I mean like
01:05:32 whoever the name is who's playing Tifa like as soon as I heard her talk I'm like oh my god that
01:05:38 sounds good like that sounds how I'd want her to sound whereas I think before she was played by
01:05:43 Christy Carlson Romano and Advent Children and it just sounded like a girl you know but she
01:05:47 sounds like she's got some years lived in her you know she sounds like she's got some city miles
01:05:51 and I suppose I know what you mean and like Barrett I think is perfect I think like he nails
01:05:57 like the Barrett being tough but he also nails the Barrett being sweet with his daughter and stuff
01:06:01 and like you can buy that this character has like a heart exterior and has a good heart
01:06:07 kind of like my favorite character I mean I've always fucking loved Barrett he's just
01:06:10 wonderful to see although he's legitimately scary sometimes he kind of scares me because he's so big
01:06:16 and I fear black men you know just across the board I'm assuming that cloud is still Steve
01:06:25 Burton like he's been for years I think he's really good in this game better if it is the same
01:06:29 guy it comes off like it's a lot better in this game I don't know and like this the dialogue to me
01:06:35 for the most part feels like real people talking and it's better than I thought it would be and like
01:06:42 I said it takes an immediate nosedive as soon as crisis course shows up on his fucking motorcycle
01:06:46 you know just to be clear none of my complaint I mean I don't know I think a lot of it is kind of
01:06:50 generically anime like dub voice stuff like I tried to do in Japanese I was like I can't tell
01:06:55 these fucking gooks are saying fuck this shit I went back to English the one the one that I don't
01:07:00 like as much though is wedge I oh I liked wedge he had like a unique kind of raspy yeah he sounds
01:07:07 like a like a really like a sweet little fat boy um but I don't like I don't like that all of his
01:07:13 dialogue is about being fat well I was going to say the problem is the writing not the voice
01:07:19 yeah that's the one area where I'm like can't wedge say something different besides
01:07:23 flanderization I mean I I don't know if you agree but I would start like flanderization is the theme
01:07:29 of this game is it really flanderization in wedges case because he didn't actually say much of
01:07:33 anything in the original okay no I was gonna say he has always been like a silly character who wasn't
01:07:39 that serious so that that's fair he was always like a cloud fanboy so they got that aspect oh you
01:07:43 know what actually I take it back because he has there's more to him just being fat but I thought
01:07:47 they were laying it on a little bit thick with the constant I'm running on empty guys I need pizza
01:07:53 and my fat little piggy belly but it's so relatable though but it's a symptom of the disease and
01:08:00 quota whatever of because there's just more stuff characters need to say because we need to give them
01:08:05 more lines like the writers are sitting there like okay what do we got for wedge like what can we
01:08:10 have this guy say and they just think we know one thing and one thing alone about wedge that he's fat
01:08:16 we this is why we have like the design bible right you're flipping you got like
01:08:21 character sketches and like bios is written in like wedge it's just blank they're like
01:08:25 scrambled to come up with some something to say about them you know I think Ben you I bet you
01:08:30 would agree with me look this is the thing kumars and waifu heads are gonna fucking love this shit
01:08:36 I hate it what and it is exactly how I believe it's that how much they have cranked up Jesse's
01:08:44 obsession with cloud oh my god she is so fucking thirsty oh didn't she just like damn did she just
01:08:51 like I okay honestly I don't really remember what Jesse was like are you she oh I remember like him
01:08:57 or did she just like think he was yes because he was like really strong she did she did like him she
01:09:02 was flirty and she was kind of like a klutz all of that is in the game but there's like a lot more
01:09:06 of the first thing that's what I'm saying about flanderization they're they were like in their
01:09:11 design bible what do we know about Jesse like okay she was kind of the smart one okay we can keep
01:09:15 that also she loves cloud well this is advent children writing boys let's crank that shit up to 11
01:09:20 she worship is the fucking ground he walks on she's so into him instantly I was like I was like
01:09:26 Jesse it makes her pathetic yeah at a certain point I was like okay why is she this thirsty
01:09:33 and then like there is kind of like a line that lampshades it a little bit where wedge is like
01:09:37 hey cloud uh just so you know don't fall for it she just likes to fuck with guys
01:09:40 you know I'm like I don't know wedge maybe she just likes to fuck with you because that might be
01:09:45 believable if we if we ever saw her flirt with another man ever at any point but we don't and
01:09:51 there's only directly apart where it's like one character's like oh uh bigs is pretty neurotic
01:09:57 and like the next time you see bigs he's like sweeping outside of his house like doing like
01:10:03 you're gonna rabbit from Winnie the Pooh shit like yeah like he wasn't doing anything neurotic
01:10:07 before that line but then someone said it and now it's like oh don't yes I am now that you
01:10:11 mentioned it I'm sweeping the dirt outside my house for some reason I did think I oh boy I did
01:10:18 really like I mean she's not just flirty they did try to make more to her I really like the
01:10:24 mission going to her house bro I want to be an actress I fucking hated it I hate it all oh my
01:10:29 god I loved just like I liked how that was the moment where cloud started to warm up because he
01:10:36 sneaks into the house and he sees her dad with mako poisoning mako poisoning if I can whatever
01:10:41 I'm calling it mako I don't give a shit exactly mako poisoning and so then you know you're talking
01:10:47 to bigs and wedge outside and there's that scene where they're walking down the street just kind
01:10:50 of talking about her upbringing and how she came to join avalanche and you can you can see that cloud
01:10:55 is like kind of like understanding and like relating to the mako poisoning stuff because
01:10:59 like he's bent through all kinds of like mako infusions shit as we'll find out more of later
01:11:04 and he's just like yeah okay and it's like I like I love that little scene it was like really kind of
01:11:09 heartwarming and like kind of like uh like as like you know the fucking Stephen King or the boys
01:11:14 in the woods they find the body you know it was like that kind of feeling and I was like yeah
01:11:19 I like this so they I don't know maybe they'll flesh her out even more but I like the flushing
01:11:24 you know I didn't hate it but let's not forget there's that section and then the roche like
01:11:30 thing happens immediately afterward I know everything good that I want to say it's don't
01:11:34 forget then then that guy shows up and and the other thing is I have to weigh that okay we get
01:11:39 some additional characterization of Jesse I think it okay it's it's okay I don't I don't hate it
01:11:43 instantly but I mean it's filled with like dialogue of of wedge bill oh my belly's so full of the
01:11:48 midgar special pizza I want to eat a whole pizza myself just see oh please uh but the and then
01:12:00 I'm weighing that at every moment in my head which I think is totally fair to do
01:12:05 versus you know what happened in the original cloud went to sleep and then we got to the next
01:12:09 reactor mission and it was fucking sick uh and like I'm just thinking like I could be doing that
01:12:14 right now I could be moving the plot forward I could be you know I don't know I like to have
01:12:19 the time to breathe and like walk around the slums and do the side missions I had plenty as it was
01:12:25 but I get your point just watched gun buster and die buster and been once again reminded
01:12:32 that shorter is always better there's never a time when a story can be made longer and better
01:12:39 you have to choose one uh yeah I don't know um the idea that like oh they just they just expanded
01:12:48 all these character traits and like made it last a lot longer is kind of like oof I don't know about
01:12:52 that I don't know about that you gotta ask the quite like so they're expanding them they're
01:12:56 filling in more detail who's writing that dialogue to what end and I I mean my general argument would
01:13:02 be like overall it's not worth it they're not adding enough to these characters to justify
01:13:07 like they kind of have to because like that that's another it's a totally separate thing
01:13:11 once it was decided they were making a game out of a tenth of a game they had to fill that time
01:13:16 so there like was no option so like you can fucking game gonna be bro they haven't told us
01:13:21 anything about that no one knows it's totally a mystery but I can tell you that this game
01:13:26 encompasses about four hours of the original out of like a 40 50 hour game that's you know
01:13:32 a tenth of the runtime I can't I can't fucking wait till the ps6 comes out so I can finally buy
01:13:40 Final Fantasy 7 remake complete edition on four discs won't that be fun well it's gonna be really fun
01:13:44 when the initial parts look terrible compared to the end parts and it you know yeah well thanks
01:13:49 they'll have to remake the remake well I'm glad Square Enix figured out how they're gonna stay
01:13:53 afloat for the next 20 years I I mean I still I still insist okay economic times are you actually
01:14:00 can't wait for Nate Nate at the ripe old age of 50 recording his podcast about the end of Final Fantasy
01:14:06 7 I'll be there baby I'll be there you know I've got a little story to tell just to put a cap on this
01:14:11 well first of all I don't um uh I I think given what I know about the end of this game I I think
01:14:17 by prediction will come true that I think sales for volume two or whatever it's called will be
01:14:22 nothing compared this game has been very successful of course it has yeah I think that the next one
01:14:27 will not be similar what what if they just like they sold the first one it was wildly successful
01:14:33 but they're like okay but the sequel will never be as successful so we're just we're just they might
01:14:37 just gonna call it here they might know what I would not even blame them or be surprised if they
01:14:42 did that not at all not at all uh but here's my quick little story it's just when I was a kid in
01:14:49 in like middle school and high school me and my friends all loved this game and we talked about
01:14:54 it and we we even back in fucking like 2001 like 2000 even before that fucking 99 and shit
01:15:02 we were like okay maybe not 99 a couple years later it came out in 97 probably like 2004-2005
01:15:09 when they were starting to legitimately make remasters of Final Fantasy 1 and 2 and 4 and
01:15:14 Fidever got one neither did 6 but like and Final Fantasy 4 got like a 3d remake on the DS
01:15:21 Final Fantasy anthology on the ps1 there you go which is uh that's one and two or is that
01:15:26 five and six five and six right right when they released those on PlayStation one
01:15:30 back in the day so okay boy like my mind has been filled with the prospect of a Final Fantasy 7
01:15:37 remake since I was a fucking child I've been dreaming of it coming out and you know it's not
01:15:43 just about me me and my friends we we basically made a pact that whatever happened we would like
01:15:49 at the time we were kids we were like man we'll buy whatever console imagine we might buy a ps3
01:15:55 if we have to to get this remake we'll save up our pennies and we'll save our allowance when we're
01:16:01 like 30 that's right when we're 45 you know what's happened since then every single one of those
01:16:07 friends has lost interest I am the only one left of that group who still cares I was just talking
01:16:13 to my college friends the other day none of them care they have all lost it's only me now I'm aware
01:16:19 this game is successful but I think that is very interesting I know exactly who they're marketing
01:16:24 this to and it's not me and uh I just think it's and now that it's here and I'm seeing what they're
01:16:31 doing with it now that I mean I basically know what the ending is uh I just there's just I don't
01:16:38 know what I'm saying there's just no no respect and in my mind there's no hope uh for I mean look
01:16:43 I gave up hope years ago years ago I gave up hope we knew again that there would be no respect
01:16:49 and no hope and like you said there there's parts that are good man this part that some people cared
01:16:55 some people loved what they were doing uh but like the I mean what's most important this is a story
01:17:00 driven game the fact that like there is are even you Jesse have gotten to parts where they've said
01:17:04 like we need to change destiny things need to be we need to set right things that are wrong
01:17:10 like the the the ghosts the time ghosts that show up at the very beginning to fuck with things uh
01:17:15 is there is there a fucking point is there maybe some
01:17:19 like plot thing in final phase seven that's considered like maybe like a sad event or
01:17:23 like a tragic event that like maybe we might want to try to avoid maybe something that might be like
01:17:29 one of the most iconic spoilers in all of all time is there something like that in five of seven
01:17:34 I I can't think of anything but uh you know it would sure be okay stop stop dancing around
01:17:40 and spoiling shit without spoiling it Nate I know what you're getting at I can fucking read
01:17:44 between the lines here enough yeah we can stop talking about this I want to be surprised by at
01:17:49 least something yeah okay okay and again I'm just this is just speculation but the only
01:17:55 like positive thing as someone who has no context just listening to this conversation
01:17:59 the only positive thing that I can possibly see of like the crazy fan boys and that comes around
01:18:05 from final fantasy seven is that if the hardcore fans like you Nate are super pissed off by this
01:18:12 entire project when it hits pc you know someone's gonna mod out all the bullshit and they'll have
01:18:17 like the fan director cut where it's just like all the good shit and all the bad shit's gone
01:18:23 and you'll just have that and and you'll just be able to get it from the fucking nexus and it'll
01:18:28 be fine again I I don't want them to keep raping my game I just uh would prefer they did not do
01:18:35 that personally I will seek all right so we've talked a lot about a game that is maybe
01:18:42 maybe good maybe bad maybe kind of bad let's talk about a game that is unequivocally good
01:18:48 that is perfect okay let's talk about animal crossing guess do you guys play animal crossing
01:18:54 we are all stuck inside we're all quarantined it's it's animal crossing season baby it's the
01:19:00 opposite of that one summer when everyone went out and played pokemon go now is the plague times
01:19:05 when everyone's stuck at home playing animal crossing this is what we're doing hey hey we're
01:19:09 recording this on bunny day uh ben have you obtained all the recipes as a matter of fact
01:19:15 I am the king of easter yes I'm I'm one away I'm a one away and I don't know where to find it
01:19:21 who's driving just just pop balloons I was also one way actually uh okay I think I found it on the
01:19:27 beach in a bottle but just pop balloons I already checked the beach god damn it so you are playing
01:19:32 it yeah yeah I'm playing it I bought it uh two weeks ago maybe three that's epic okay let me let me
01:19:38 tell you let me tell you what I'm doing let's visit each other's islands Ben we should visit each
01:19:42 other's islands let me what I'm doing right now my wait what fruit do you have what fruit do you
01:19:46 have apples oh I've got oranges and peaches I what we've based my my roommate has already found
01:19:53 peaches and oranges on like random god damn it with the one we need is pears we are only missing
01:19:59 pears um you should head to idub's girlfriend's island uh she's a pear shaped head that's the joke
01:20:04 okay so my my project right now is um I am uh I am trying to breed roses balloons right now I'm
01:20:14 breeding roses I looked up a guide it's I want to I want to make I want to bleed breed black
01:20:21 roses and purple roses and you have to you have to do all this bullshit you have to you
01:20:25 have to plant them in a certain way and like wait and my my rose beds have been planted for days
01:20:30 I have I have created two black roses and one purple rose and today a freak anomaly occurred
01:20:37 and somehow a pink rose was bred out of what red roses which is not supposed to be able to happen
01:20:43 nevertheless there it is staring me in the face in defiance of all facts and logic can you transpose
01:20:49 flowers between areas without destroying them because I've had issues with that do you have to
01:20:53 dig them up correctly you just dig them up you can't you can't destroy them unless you sell them
01:20:58 or okay okay cool yeah in fact you can even water them dig them up and replant them and they're
01:21:04 still watered sick for the rest of the day um based uh you know yeah I upgraded my house yeah I gave
01:21:13 it some cool like skull pattern carpeting uh you know yeah yeah I gave it a black roof uh yeah I
01:21:20 built like a cool like a wrought iron and stone like fence around the whole thing um yeah I'm gonna
01:21:26 move to like live up in like a scary castle on the top of the highest hill uh yeah you know it's all
01:21:33 pretty good then provide pictures please I want to see it I will try to get some pictures I lost my
01:21:40 switch charger on some trip somewhere so I can't play any well hey that's okay it just
01:21:45 uses a usbc you can uh you can get a cheap one of those I can do a what it's it's a usbc uh like
01:21:51 generic uh plug I'm literally using my phone charger right now to charge my switch yeah cool
01:21:59 it could be done there you go you're welcome hippo are you gonna say something no I was just
01:22:04 well yes I was uh there's a balloon I found a balloon please have my last recipe it's gotta be
01:22:10 an egg balloon it is an egg balloon oh my god is this it live please oh it's a fucking sky egg I'm
01:22:17 sorry you're gonna need those sky eggs for the final right spoilers but after you get the final recipe
01:22:24 he gives you another recipe that you have to then craft I've got a million eggs I can trade them in
01:22:28 for that I'll be I'll be good it's it's like this is a perfect example but um
01:22:33 animal crossing has been extremely amusing to me because everybody I know is playing it
01:22:38 and um a lot of the people I know playing it are big gamers and this this cute little fun game about
01:22:45 like having animals and a house on an island has most of the discussion I see is like hardcore
01:22:53 gamer goon like min maxing like strategizing graphics like graphs like like spreadsheets of like
01:23:01 it's it's so intense maximizing your returns on the stock market return at price it's hell yeah
01:23:06 dude hell yeah it's so much of that it's really funny to listen to have you guys seen Hideki Kamiya
01:23:10 is like tweeting tons of animal crossing shit that he's playing right now he's got like a weird like
01:23:15 he's got just like his ground laid out with like sorted massive amounts of items like on the on
01:23:21 his fucking open field I don't know what he's doing but uh he's doing something and it's very
01:23:25 interesting it's just like if I were to play the game I don't have a switch but if I did uh you
01:23:30 know I would I would consider it because it's it looks pretty cute and I've never played an animal
01:23:34 crossing game before but like to be in the conversation is like everybody is talking about
01:23:40 like extreme shit and I would probably just be like chopping logs or doing whatever like I
01:23:46 missed my chance to invest in the stock market um today because I was too late to catch the uh the
01:23:55 turnip pig another balloon it's just so funny no idea if I'd even like animal crossing I've never
01:24:01 played it before I have like pocket cam installed on my iPad I figured to give that a shot you know
01:24:06 Tom I think you like the actual I played I played the old um I played the old one on the like the
01:24:12 the 3ds uh yeah uh yeah I think I played new leaf um and like I was into it for a while you know
01:24:19 eventually I you know I fully upgraded my house got on my island taken care of and I was like okay
01:24:24 I did everything I keep thinking maybe I'll just start playing animal crossing and then I look at
01:24:29 my computer and the little doom eternal icon I'm like I'd much rather kill demons again I just
01:24:34 play I mean I still to beat the fucking last level of doom eternal I think animal crossing is pretty
01:24:40 fun you know the way the way to play at hardcore I don't know like it's tell me please I want the
01:24:45 stretch well I mean maybe I'm doing it wrong but all you do is you just um like you have the little
01:24:51 like nook miles plus uh mini goals you just you just do those yep like you just run around doing
01:24:57 those and everything else takes care of itself you do those uh and yeah that's that's true pretty
01:25:02 much that incentivizes you do you do those and then what do you do with any recipes that you think
01:25:07 look really cool and you want like a cool leather sofa or something yeah well what do you do with
01:25:12 the miles though because you can cash them in to go to different islands you yeah you explore other
01:25:16 islands you spend that well you I mean have you like upgraded your inventory oh I one time yes
01:25:22 oh dude get the final get the full inventory upgrade how big is it like how many you can get
01:25:27 two upgrades up to four rows okay why the fuck have I not done that already all right yeah um
01:25:32 that's what I need I mean yeah I'm pretty much at the point where I don't have anything essential
01:25:36 to spend my miles on anymore so yeah yeah it all just just buying like telephone poles and street
01:25:42 lamps and stuff just put out you know you know I I was given a fucking uh one of those oh I bought
01:25:47 the uh the god's giant Godzilla that's that's hanging out next to my town hall now actually
01:25:54 just this morning isabel moved in the wife who was here boys whip your dicks out wait here we go oh
01:26:02 I expanded okay because I um my friend had already been playing because right because
01:26:08 there's only one island per switch so my friend had already been on the island he had already
01:26:13 done a bunch of stuff he had built like a couple of bridges and things so I moved in and like the
01:26:18 town hall is already built there's already bridges and stuff like I already have access to the store
01:26:23 so I kind of had it easy because he did he like took care of a lot of the bullshit
01:26:28 he gave me some stone so I could make axes like right off the out the gate you know uh I do have
01:26:34 a little story about Animal Crossing this is I was thinking of making a video but now my brain
01:26:39 has just been consumed by uh by uh the remake the final seven remake and stuff so like I still might
01:26:45 make this this might be one of those instances where me talking about it means I'll never make it
01:26:48 but fuck it I can get it out there somewhere it's just that so I was playing Animal Crossing and
01:26:53 there's a certain point you hit okay there's this feature that when you when you eat a fruit uh and
01:26:59 it makes your like you're like super effective and so yeah mistakenly I accidentally shattered
01:27:04 like every rock on my island they grow like the first day they do grow back but this was extremely
01:27:10 frustrating me when I realized what I had done uh and for like two days I was getting like no iron
01:27:15 and it was at the point where your bottleneck where you have to give them iron to like upgrade to like
01:27:19 build the the shop or whatever to to keep like the progression of the town going or whatever oh okay
01:27:24 yeah I never had to do that sure sure but I did though because I'm Michelle and I are both playing
01:27:29 but I play more than she does um a typical man you know the woman just fucking dragging her ass um
01:27:35 but uh a man's a man's place is in is in the home building furniture catching butterflies
01:27:43 planting flowers and doing interior decorating um and whatnot so I uh so the the bottleneck of that
01:27:52 iron ore was making me see to put it lightly and for days I was getting like two iron at a time
01:27:58 because I had so few rocks and because it was also um you know Easter season so I was getting those
01:28:03 fucking eggs instead of any fucking I'm so excited that the eggs will be gone I hate them every time I
01:28:09 hit a rock and eggs pop out I'd like one of my dick pops out and I have to jack it out of rage
01:28:14 it's infuriating yeah uh that's how it goes so so I was even doing you know you use the thing you
01:28:21 travel to other islands I haven't I have literally I have never found a fossil I only find what
01:28:26 eggs yes insane that's crazy yeah uh truly shocking truly shocking well yeah eggs need to
01:28:33 fucking die and they'll be gone tomorrow thank god um so I was bottlenecked with this iron ore
01:28:37 it made me so pissed and you know I was like uh you know what fuck this game this game's literally
01:28:40 bad uh it's terrible it wastes my fucking time and of course you have to say every action in the
01:28:47 game is designed to be comfy as opposed to efficient and like give you a little like talk you talk to
01:28:54 people oh they'll tell you about your day you walk into the store they waste a full second of your
01:28:58 life as they say hello instead of just letting you walk in and get your fucking business trading
01:29:03 trading eggs trading eggs with the Easter Bunny one at a time one at a time it takes forever it's
01:29:09 a nightmare it takes like 12 lines of dialogue just to do it I can't you have to click so many
01:29:15 fucking menus okay it's awful so so at a certain point I said you know what literally fuck this game
01:29:20 I'm never playing it again I'm gonna go play fucking factorial so I'd never played factorial but I
01:29:25 wait when was this this was I mean this all happened within the last like seven ten days something like
01:29:30 that earlier today it was like a week ago or something um so I I started playing factorial
01:29:40 and I was like oh god yes uh this this game is designed for efficiency it feels so fucking good
01:29:46 it's like it's like um oh shit what's that fucking game we have got it on this switch
01:29:50 it's that game where you build an island and you aim to animal crossing new horizons it's
01:29:55 something like that no wait it's right there on my menu forager it's like forager combined with
01:30:00 like starcraft so it's just about building buildings make an efficient and it's it's
01:30:04 amazing I've seen destiny play it a few times I was always curious um it's all about building
01:30:09 treadmills and creating these elaborate circuit systems in order to generate items that are used
01:30:15 to build more complex items uh whatever it's a very complicated like you design factories basically
01:30:21 and layouts and stuff and for a while I was like oh god we know it from the mathematosis video
01:30:26 oh I oh shit he's oh I gotta watch that instantly because I fucking love that game now he's done
01:30:30 he's done videos on like this game and like every other game this company has ever made
01:30:35 oh that was those guys this is uh one of those guys fucking yeah what is it called uh yeah he's done
01:30:41 he's done a whole series those were great but I didn't fucking miss that completely I didn't
01:30:46 understand them I thought they were neat to look at this game uh okay it's awesome until it became
01:30:51 the worst game I've ever played in my fucking life uh and it it it just hits a point where it
01:30:56 seems like the theme of the entire episode this game was great until it's animal crossing was so
01:31:02 great until these fucking eggs showed up and yeah listen listen it's just that I was playing the
01:31:06 factorial loved it for like two days and then you you hit a certain point where like okay I've got
01:31:12 a factory going you're okay basically in order to progress you need to generate like these potions
01:31:16 you start with like red potion then you go to like whatever like green then like blue to make
01:31:21 those potions you need like weird combinations of different like tools that you have to have
01:31:26 factories generating and stuff like but it gets exponentially more complicated to get each of
01:31:32 them I hit the point where I was just like fuck this I'm not doing that you can't hold me hostage
01:31:38 making any more of these fucking potions I give up and it was just too complicated my brain is
01:31:43 too small and at that point I picked up animal crossing I'm like you know this game's actually
01:31:47 pretty good it's not maybe maybe efficiency and aiming for like autistic factory simulator isn't
01:31:53 always good sometimes you just want to shake a tree and get a coconut and that's what I'm doing
01:31:58 that's what I'm doing at this very moment and it feels pretty fucking good oh god so it's been a
01:32:03 journey it's and I still might make a video where that where I encapsulate this arc in a more artistic
01:32:09 way but this has been my uh this has been my journey through these games efficiency pretty cool
01:32:14 for a while but then I kind of get fucking sick of it and you just want to talk to a buddy yeah
01:32:18 yeah well not well not the bunny someone else I hate the fucking bunny but uh I don't know Tom
01:32:23 who who who are your villagers okay I've got a fucking hamburger ass looking sheep she looks
01:32:29 like a fucking hamburger wait no I'm talking about wait is it that Carlos her her name is Frida her
01:32:35 name is Frida no she looks like I was gonna say I've got a ram named Carlos but uh okay she I
01:32:41 think she's a female ram um I've got a purple bear who I like her name is Megan Megan the
01:32:48 purple bear she's kind of cool mm-hmm I have uh a hippo I have a hippo who loves to lift weights
01:32:56 who I forget his name uh wait I can go to the menu something shit hippo crit uh and he hates the mud
01:33:03 puddle he hates mud he likes to steal an iron well he's a freaking freak he's a monster and uh who
01:33:09 just move in was I've got like a lion girl or something who has no discernible personality
01:33:14 so I I've got let me let me wrap I got Carlos the kind of the pretentious ram I got I I met on an
01:33:21 island a pig named Gala who I I invited her to live with us she's here now um my other friend
01:33:29 Toby just met a snow leopard who he invited she hasn't moved in yet a like old snow okay there's
01:33:36 a snow leopard that's Cassie there's an it's just a snap yeah a snap that's right this like this
01:33:41 old fox who dresses like preppy but his like wallpaper is like gangster like like tags and
01:33:49 like like graffiti and I do not know what the fuck his deal is but he just moved in he's in his
01:33:54 chief uh like grumpo is this like gruff bear who is always like singing on the beach diva the just
01:34:01 the terrifying frog um uh flora is like this episode got weird at a certain it did get weird
01:34:09 but this is cool wait I think I can remember them all I'm oh okay all of our favorite is um um
01:34:15 Weber the duck he just like he's tiny and he just like waddles around and like he's he's like he's
01:34:22 always like thinking about things like huh uh eggs you're made of candy and like they taste
01:34:28 really good it's almost like it's all designed on purpose he's aware that he's a video game
01:34:35 character yes quack quack we all we all like Weber he gave us medicine when we got stung by wasps
01:34:41 oh that's nice and uh uh uh there's um fauna is a deer she's fine she's my neighbor right now
01:34:48 best guy is bam who is like a a stag or something he's like a blue like like deer stag and he is
01:34:56 like a weightlifter and he's always like making shit in his house and when he goes outside Noja he
01:35:02 literally like puts his arms he goes to the beach puts his arms behind him and Naruto runs around
01:35:07 the beach like he's pretending to run like he's pretending to headbutt stuff and the other day
01:35:11 I talked to him and he was like hey hey Ben looking built kablang and I was like yes I love bam
01:35:19 he's my favorite um so those are my boys is this game like any kind of substantial improvement over
01:35:25 Animal Crossing GameCube from 20 years ago or is it just there are some tiny efficiency improvements
01:35:31 because everything I hear from it I didn't play the GameCube one so I don't know what that one
01:35:34 was missing it's got like a new crafting system well everything I hear about Animal Crossing
01:35:40 you know it's never this Animal Crossing is good for this reason it's always Animal Crossing is good
01:35:46 like every time they're all the same game comes out there's no information anywhere
01:35:51 then the crafting is definitely an improvement yeah it adds a lot um other than that I mean
01:35:58 it's basically the same game just with more stuff yeah I think maybe there could be that there's
01:36:04 space in the world for like an extreme in-depth analysis of all the Animal Crossing games well
01:36:10 that's true because because I have the same problem like Animal Crossing is just beloved by everyone
01:36:14 but like I mean there's just two things do I do I need to really play it it's it's cute things and
01:36:21 it's like a very like gripping like a progression loop yeah of like of like they get you get a lot
01:36:29 of rewards and there's a lot of like shit to work towards mm-hmm like in a meta sense Animal
01:36:34 Crossing exists in two states pre-Isabel and post-Isabel when Isabel became like the most
01:36:40 important aspect of Animal Crossing in-game though she just doesn't do anything I mean she
01:36:45 won't if she fucking works behind a desk I gotta tell you I'm very proud of myself uh Caleb found
01:36:50 my friend Caleb founded the island he named it Yakitori Island and uh I designed the flag and
01:36:56 it is a yakitori hey that's it's all coming together baby it's just a chicken on a stick
01:37:03 just today since Isabel moved in I was able to change the flag I'm going to make it some kind
01:37:06 of pirate flag possibly but cool that's why I did the old days with my my ds version I put I put the
01:37:12 New Los Angeles City theme song in as the town tune but I don't really think it fits so I think
01:37:18 I'm gonna change it do you have to construct the song at a note so I was gonna do that I just didn't
01:37:22 get to it yet yeah yeah yeah they give you a little like fucking Mario Mario maker like uh oh that's
01:37:27 cool a tune creator to maybe all people give me a little like do do do do do do do do do do do
01:37:35 wait wait you gotta give it a do do do do wait no as soon as I'm done with this I'm gonna go and
01:37:42 I'm gonna make that the town tune good idea good idea uh yeah it's gotta be quite a few
01:37:51 are there any skull masks that we can get I want to be sans there's I have a skull floor and I have
01:37:56 a skull wallpaper it's really good is sans a killer or a rowdy I would have to say he's a killer I
01:38:04 I don't know I feel like sans is a juvie killer aligned maybe he might just be like a really tough
01:38:11 juvie yeah yeah I mean if it's like papyrus and sans like papyrus is the rowdy of the two and
01:38:20 it's definitely killer or of the two but they might just both be juvies I don't know
01:38:27 sans is too powerful he's above the gang war yeah that's true pretentious fuck
01:38:34 so yeah animal crossing I'll try and get pictures of my rose garden please do please do
01:38:40 get us the flag and let's see what things look like that hell yes I'll show that shit off
01:38:45 mine is not impressive enough should I like um hey okay I haven't done any like multiplayer
01:38:51 with it is like if I just like show my like my like island profile will it have like a
01:38:56 number on it that people can use to like send me stuff you know I don't I haven't done anything with
01:39:00 it yet um if I knew I'd I'd say but I could be I could be like hey guys here's my island number
01:39:08 you can mail me things if you want maybe I that might do unboxing videos I've seen I've seen
01:39:15 people posting like their custom designs online and I think you can just like type the number in
01:39:20 like a serial number and just get it that's yeah there's something like that um or you might have
01:39:25 to like send you might have to buy it from them or something there might it might be more complicated
01:39:29 than just knowing the number I did I did enjoy very much being able to this wasn't an online thing
01:39:35 but I sent Michelle a letter from the post office that said uh something along the lines of like
01:39:39 dear Michelle fuck you get off my island uh sign Nate I um my um my my friend Dube was uh he was
01:39:48 watching me play and he he was like Ben you're stripping the island bear of all its resources
01:39:54 like you've like taken all the rocks and all the and all the fruits and I was like I left
01:40:00 some apples in the north he's like oh apples oh great apples thanks to the worst vegetable
01:40:04 so I felt so I felt bad so I went and I sent he was like you're you're denuding the island's
01:40:09 vegetation so I denuding denuding I'm pretty sure that's a word so I went to the post office
01:40:15 and I sent him a stimulus package of 10 000 bells and I said sorry for denuding and uh that was my
01:40:22 story look at this video I found okay I think I might want to get this game
01:40:30 I see oh it's uh Anka yeah have you guys seen the incredible Anka pornography that exists that
01:40:36 video by minus eight or whatever what that one's pretty good yeah it's it's world famous everybody
01:40:41 knows that one wait hold on I haven't seen it yet uh the the the where's the fucking discord link
01:40:47 it's in the main chat god damn it oh lol anyway I think this uh I'm sure if this was posted on
01:40:52 twitter.com or whatever there would be many links to that video no stop that stop tea is it wrong to
01:41:02 sexualize a cat I mean she's humanoid right it's fine it's fine she can consent she can definitely
01:41:09 consent but she doesn't look like she's consenting here uh well correct no she's not so that's a
01:41:17 problem and you know what I say we can work on that all right now about animal crossing yeah I've
01:41:23 said I have to say about it we we got the voicemails you guys there's nothing else you want to talk about
01:41:28 yeah just go to voicemail I got him okay okay um let me see okay got it right here uh every
01:41:34 every one ladies and gentlemen as you know voicemail time link in the description two voicemails
01:41:41 send us some leave them it's good speakpipe.com slash whatever it is down there oh and there
01:41:46 was something I was going to say oh before I play the voicemail I just wanted to say
01:41:50 sigh of relief famous old nibba of the pcp circles and creator of like the original
01:41:57 discords or all right he made the um the bot or she I don't actually know um made like a
01:42:02 fucking bot girl girl okay there you go that uh uh the bot the bot that updates us in our
01:42:08 fucking feeds about new PCB stuff really cool stuff um sigh made that subsized based um and
01:42:13 had like a unfortunately awesome yeah now you know unfortunately left like a three minute long
01:42:20 clip that was too fucking long sigh I'm sorry you gotta keep it shorter you gotta do it but I
01:42:25 will summarize quickly and it's just that sigh is organizing a procrastinators rewatch uh like a
01:42:31 review or not a review but like a uh pcp highlights things you're gonna go back and like watch old
01:42:37 episodes is this arm retrieval but like something like that something like that is the idea to
01:42:43 scrub through to find like the highlightable moments what no I don't know uh well first of all

01:44:02 one called how many lectures are there take it away for every rad con now and in the future you
01:44:09 must clearly state how many lectures there are because I have no fucking clue I I mean it's been
01:44:16 that's it it's it's been stated I guess just not clearly enough like I we know we've said it yeah
01:44:21 well first of all we don't care for your tone over in every stream someone asks it I don't care
01:44:27 for your fucking tone buddy we don't oh you shit we've already made a bunch of lectures more are
01:44:31 coming you know that okay but to baby if he means that we have to say it before we don't know how many

01:45:26 so there you go there's your answer eight total not bad not bad uh quality may vary that's it
01:45:32 that's it answer uh complete on to our next one okay here we go so here's a message from foxy socks
01:45:40 ketu okay have written in before let's see what you got go hey pro crest leaders i got a major
01:45:47 time critical life or death situation here and i need answers post haste if you've read my twitter
01:45:52 i know ben has i plan on doing a lecture video like you guys did with radcon but there is a catch
01:45:59 we live in a post-covid society and i can't get outside to preach to people about warrior cats
01:46:05 because every second i spend in the presence of lesser beings is another percentage take up for
01:46:11 the chance of be keeling over and dying to the virus the question is should i live stream a lecture
01:46:17 and open up the chat for community members to discuss or put up a discord call get some friends in
01:46:24 record do you have anything else in mind also the finalists for choices are more or less decided
01:46:30 i'm just trying to figure out do i want to do one on warrior cats or magic the gathering
01:46:37 i need to know please respond okay foxy socks
01:46:44 personally i'd much rather see a lecture on magic the gathering just because i play it and
01:46:49 i don't know enough about the lore there's so many novels and shit i read quite a bit of it um i think
01:46:55 i mean on the one hand i know less about warrior cats yeah on the other hand is it funny like is
01:47:01 the lore of that's the question i was gonna say is it fun to summarize like grand like uh like
01:47:07 magic would i be would i be surprised by what i heard is on the other hand though fucking like
01:47:13 magic is like no one knows the fucking lore of the magic series that's a good one that's like um
01:47:18 it's like um like kingdom hearts is like nobody's played all these fucking games but came out to
01:47:24 is way funnier just inherently because it's so retarded so i mean if it was me if you're really
01:47:30 split between them personally i'd go for warrior cats but i can't tell you what to do i don't know
01:47:34 which is uh well warrior cats seems easy the magic one will be successful because yeah that's
01:47:40 probably true warrior cats would be too warrior cats has like a big internet like cult five magic
01:47:46 the gathering would be more successful maybe because more people are familiar with magic the
01:47:51 gathering and lots of those people don't know the lore and might be interested so you know that's
01:47:57 probably a safer bet honestly in terms in terms of the other half of his question uh how to do it
01:48:03 when there's virus i i don't know how well a discord call with people shouting at you through the
01:48:09 screen while you're like doing a thing like i don't know whether that would have the same effect
01:48:15 you could do it that way okay here's i mean just do a warrior cats lecture get a bunch of cats and
01:48:23 have them yeah you could i mean yeah i i agree like you could do it live stream i do think it
01:48:31 wouldn't be the same you your your quest your if you want to do it live you know your choices are
01:48:35 like either wait till the pandemic ends or maybe is there could there be a way to do it while social
01:48:43 distancing just don't come within six feet of anyone while you keep everyone six feet apart
01:48:48 the thing is like lectures are basically video essays but with people in the room
01:48:52 and then it's more of like a like a real physical thing i don't think it can be underestimated
01:48:57 how important the people in the room thing is for the the the atmosphere helps with the if you're
01:49:02 just standing there talking to a camera you may as well be making a video about it rather than
01:49:07 like a long uninterrupted unedited thing i mean well what's your time frame too like if you're
01:49:13 willing to wait a month a month a lot of things could change for this might be longer than a month
01:49:18 it might it certainly well could go be dead in a month in which case yeah i suppose so
01:49:22 uh i mean if it was me i think what i would do was like based on the crew i've got
01:49:27 i would probably like i can't recommend this to you because maybe it's a little irresponsible
01:49:30 i would just try to like vet them like okay guys like are you are you sick you've been going out
01:49:34 what's what's your deal and if not i'd be like okay i'm gonna take a risk and just like get to
01:49:38 i mean i think it's you're not supposed to do that no i mean it might be low key it might be low
01:49:45 key illegal oh that it's i don't know whether it's illegal it should be and i wouldn't respect
01:49:51 and like enforceable to like yeah i'll push you back into your house if you get caught well it's
01:49:57 well the point is i mean the point is it's that it's irresponsible yeah here's what i think you
01:50:01 could i think you could do it in a responsible way okay say you've got like a bunch of say you've
01:50:06 got like maybe one location that you want to go do it in and you all go do it and like
01:50:12 i don't know you wear gloves just wash your hands you take all the vitamins that you have in your
01:50:19 house all the vitamins and then you get uh like just eat them up no you get apple cider vinegar
01:50:27 and like the spiciest chili powder that you have and you put it all in a blender and you drink
01:50:32 a whole thing of it and then you're immune to everything forever and you'll become a super
01:50:36 human that's like a plant and so then it won't have an effect on you and you can do whatever you
01:50:41 want there you go i think if you know people it's all about brewing the right potions
01:50:50 i just think i would say if you can find a place that you can do it that everyone could
01:50:54 like get together like deep clean and then sure yeah sanitizer and wash your hands a lot
01:51:00 it would probably be okay i hope you don't i hope no one dies as a result of me saying this
01:51:06 just don't touch each other don't breathe on each other six six six six feet away six six six
01:51:12 indeed six six six feet away if preferably just get like a fucking air hang out no more no less
01:51:17 you know i mean i mean we all waited until radcon to do a lecture that took two years
01:51:23 sweet until the fucking pandemic's over yeah he doesn't sound like this is like urgent use the
01:51:26 time to take notes hasn't even decided what he's gonna do yet exactly so i mean to be fair a lot
01:51:31 of us kind of made up our mind while we were there so you could do you could do like rehearsals like
01:51:36 none of us i don't think do like live rehearsals where we try to speak the whole thing i i know i
01:51:42 probably needed to do on yeah yeah oh by the way did i mention have you guys seen my my one piece
01:51:47 lecture has cleared 100 000 views not bad not too shabby not too shabby i got recommended it
01:51:53 did oh that's oh that's the bet you know i'll just tell you guys i've made
01:51:56 about over 300 off that video i'm very glad that i did not i was so close to just letting it be
01:52:03 demonetized i was this fucking close i was like why was it demonetized well because i put okay this
01:52:08 is the weird thing that it's the binks sake song from the show that like got claimed at times i just
01:52:14 did a little creative editing to just like remove a little bit actually like the singing vocal part
01:52:19 was like the most the end song i originally wanted the whole like like the fucking straw hat crew
01:52:26 and the rolling pirates on thriller bark where they sing it with brook and stuff i wanted like
01:52:29 the voices of the crowd singing it kind of weirdly fades out now that was not intended that was just
01:52:35 to avoid copyright stuff so anyway i'm glad that i did and uh thank thank you jesus for
01:52:40 hooking me up with that one i want to say i think it's cool foxy that you're thinking about doing
01:52:45 a lecture i think i think it would be cool if more people just kind of did like hey i'll do a
01:52:49 lecture in the style of the pcp uh one other person did one uh tectonic improv did one on top
01:52:57 of the floor the lore of the lore of lingkara i haven't watched that which is but it's good it's
01:53:01 cool i i do know a bit about lingkara yeah i mean it's the it's the in universe like story of his
01:53:10 yeah like like his the like i don't want to watch all those reviews to get that so i
01:53:16 of course no ever since our men yeah you guys are aware of me um back years and years and years ago
01:53:24 when i posted the video of me and lingkara yeah at the time i met him at the fucking whatever i
01:53:31 don't remember that was before i followed you but i am aware of it i think it's amazing couldn't see
01:53:35 the video but i have seen clips of it and i have seen it at some point so yeah i was at um
01:53:41 yoma con in detroit i think it was like 2011 and i was like i was just a little like baby boy
01:53:49 youtuber this was during my that guy at the glasses forums days yep and um for some reason
01:53:55 i was just like up in one of the halls just like sitting there just like grumpily eating a lemon
01:54:01 like with the skin on it and everything because right because for i don't even know why i did this
01:54:08 but i like i oh because someone was like passing out lemons for some reason like being quirky
01:54:13 like i was like oh you think that you're quirky i'll show you fucking quirky so i'm you know so
01:54:19 i said the person i was with i was like hey fill me i'm just gonna sit here i'm gonna eat this whole
01:54:22 lemon and no one can stop me no one tried to stop me but that didn't matter so i sat there but
01:54:28 nonetheless the point was yeah and i like and i did i ate the whole lemon i was chewing through
01:54:32 the fucking rind and the fucking the gristle and the grime and the grit of the bone all the bones
01:54:38 cracking yeah the blood of this lemon pouring down my chin and i and i got the whole thing down
01:54:44 and i was like yeah and i was feeling like a real badass and and like in the middle of it
01:54:49 like linkara was like just happened to be passing by and uh like i noticed him and i was like hey
01:54:57 you it's something and like there was like this weird altercation or like i was like i was like
01:55:03 trying to like be like a badass heal like eating this lemon for no reason and he probably had no
01:55:08 fucking idea what was going on whatsoever but he came up and he was like playing into it and he
01:55:14 like did his man punch thing and he's like i am a man and went to punch me and like and i and i
01:55:21 totally no sold it like an asshole and i'm like well i've got a lemon and i just kept eating the
01:55:25 lemon in front of him like aggressively eating a lemon at linkara until he like got sad and walked
01:55:31 away like like defeated um man i feel like if i could go back and do it again i would have like
01:55:37 oversold the punch i would have like flipped back over a railing and died that would have been fun
01:55:42 yeah but i was but in the moment i was just like how dare you try to be cooler than me while i'm
01:55:45 eating a lemon you son of a bitch and so like i ate it at him and he got he he was he was destroyed
01:55:51 and no one ever heard from linkara ever again and i'm sorry this video is my it's my fault that
01:55:56 that got the glasses was went on play in horseshoe finale i think i've put clips of it in various
01:56:02 videos i think the i've definitely seen it and i think it's in horseshoe finale is that video
01:56:06 available somewhere no the full video i think it was called horseshoe finale yeah right on youtube
01:56:11 the full video of it was on like blip before blip went down i think is why it's no longer available
01:56:17 but yeah you can see clips of it in various places well regardless uh regardless on the point of
01:56:22 doing lectures whatnot i mean i've been thrilled uh to see link link in the description to tectonic
01:56:27 improv linkara lecture by the way yeah i'll use our put that in there it's just been great to see
01:56:31 that and uh ever since the fine bros uh our mentors instructed us to copyright the term lecture

01:59:04 it's good stuff okay and make sure to get your eggs in to the zipper the the egg day bunny
01:59:11 please i think is what you meant to say yeah that's right uh when you hear this a week after
01:59:16 it uh Easter days and yeah you can always set the clock the clock back to the 12th oh you're not
01:59:21 doing that shit are you i have not yet done it but i have been a little tempted here in there
01:59:25 since it's calib switch he made it very clear he's like hey yeah you can play my island you do whatever
01:59:30 you want yeah one rule is no fucking clock manipulation because that's for cowards and you
01:59:36 cheat not only the game but yourself yourself you didn't grow you didn't evolve you didn't
01:59:42 so that's why i'm stuck waiting waiting in three three whole days of waiting to have bred uh four
01:59:49 special crossbreed roses but soon soon the population will explode once i get to that
01:59:55 man talk about a game wasting your time yeah in game time it's about the journey yeah fair uh
02:00:02 okay let's go to our next voicemail uh this one is simply called you should be able to solve this
02:00:07 take it away hey fellas disappointed that you didn't get the crab and a half question correct
02:00:12 you should have been able to solve it really i don't know what was the answer much easier one
02:00:16 oh whatever a bat and a ball cost a dollar ten in total a bat and a ball a dollar ten
02:00:26 the bat costs a dollar more than the ball how much does the ball cost okay now you really truly
02:00:34 honestly and ironically should be able to solve this i think i think it's yeah five cents easy
02:00:42 i'm not gonna play your fucking head games that is yeah that is easy i'm mad okay he says we got
02:00:48 the crab and a half question wrong but he doesn't tell us what the answer is that that is frustrating
02:00:53 that is frustrating what was this one a bat in a ball or a bat i don't understand a bat and a ball
02:00:59 like like a baseball bat and a baseball okay a bat and a ball cost a dollar ten the bat costs a
02:01:05 dollar more so the answer is the ball yeah the ball costs five cents the bat costs a dollar five
02:01:11 easy two i really feel like the problem with the crab question if we got it wrong i think it's
02:01:16 because it was phrased confusingly what was the crab that's the point of these riddles or or questions
02:01:23 is that they're supposed it was like a complicated thing like two crabs get in half the crabs get
02:01:28 out i don't know it's all the birds trying to push you towards making like this obvious answer that
02:01:32 is actually the dumb answer but it's just some like your head first so you just blurt it out
02:01:37 because you don't give a shit the they're phrased confusingly purposely to make you think the obvious
02:01:42 answer but it's not actually because it sounds i guess that would have been two weeks ago was it
02:01:47 really it feels like this forever ago on friday on friday or on yes yes two days ago when we
02:01:54 recorded this the new episode came out i had no idea that a week had gone by that i had not been
02:01:59 on the podcast really fast i had no i was like wait i missed one weird and then today today i
02:02:08 missed the first half because i was catching all my fucking egg recipes priorities and lost track of
02:02:13 the time lost in the sauce hmm oh time to go make that wobbling zipper toy fuck yeah and then i'll be
02:02:20 the king of games uh all right well there you go uh let's move on to our next voicemail which is
02:02:26 simply called that's our word the z word okay go hey it's key blade uh three minutes into the new
02:02:35 podcast please don't use saibatsu um i guess that's what you could consider a trigger for me i guess
02:02:43 i'm legally a faggot now um yeah i can't really control it uh it would just make me sad for you
02:02:51 know like give or take two minutes you know we're tuning in every week to the pcp zibatsu cast
02:02:57 shitting on you know my my new internet dad's shitting on the corpses of my old dead internet
02:03:03 dad's not anybody although you know zibatsu being dead a funny joke golf clap i don't uh if you want
02:03:10 some insider baseball on that uh as a as an old zibatsu head um that's funny on two levels not
02:03:18 only because they're all like you know like a live irl none of them have died since uh also because
02:03:25 all of their you know all of the solo channels they predictably made afterwards uh they're all
02:03:31 shit and terrible and boring uh because the fuck is none of them are funny by themselves without
02:03:36 anyone to play off of and they everything interesting they have to say i've already heard them say it
02:03:43 multiple times over the course of years since 2013 when they first started the friendcast
02:03:48 uh so i guess what i'm trying to say is shut down r slash two best friends play you fucking idiots
02:03:55 are in denial it's your last bastion of hope shut down hope become bitter like me
02:04:03 okay okay zibatsu is a japanese term referring to industrial and financial business conglomerates
02:04:08 in the empire of japan whose influence and size allowed control over significant parts of the
02:04:12 japanese economy from the meiji period until the end of world war two okay listen listen at at the
02:04:20 beginning of last episode that only tom was here for i i said a little piece about like oh you know
02:04:25 i heard about zibatsu like i'd heard the term i actually went and looked it up and it is like a
02:04:29 like it's exactly what bends it it's like a cool term that would kind of apply and now i i get what
02:04:33 it meant to the two best friends to the pcb the point was that we are a zibatsu
02:04:41 in the beginning very briefly at the beginning yeah yeah what how did it come up
02:04:45 i got i just started talking i had just been looking it up and i just thought it was funny
02:04:49 because i i thought it was like a wrestling zibatsu yeah as nat was there was a whole
02:04:53 there was a goddamn story where i was like i can't remember why i was googling the company nissan
02:04:58 for some reason and i was like i don't know and it said nissan was formed out of like the
02:05:03 nissan zibatsu and i'm like what the fuck wait what and then i just followed that thread and i
02:05:08 was like oh it's the thing that's why they called themselves that's a business conglomerate makes
02:05:12 sense okay guys i solved it i found the answer here oh that makes me very mad already is that
02:05:20 out of angst business to business whiteboard oh my god listen to this i don't want to actually
02:05:26 listen to it can i no well just go animate that ain't good all right put that this is so fun no
02:05:34 this is so good it's like text to speech explaining what a word i'm upset i'm not having a good time
02:05:41 anymore why is this oh dude we found this is how this is how you do a social distancing uh pcp
02:05:46 lecture we figured out the format maybe you type out the script and you do it in like go animate
02:05:51 rayman things with albert einstein whoa ben how do you get star fragments what the fuck is that
02:05:59 thanks professor that explains zibatsu no problem you get star fragments nate by um at night i have
02:06:06 another recipe for a star one that blathers sister gave to me but yeah the way that you get star
02:06:13 pieces is apparently at night sometimes shooting stars happen and if you are looking at the sky
02:06:18 like you have the camera all the way up and you see a shooting star you hit a to make a wish
02:06:23 and if you do that then the next morning star pieces will appear on the beach whoa yeah and
02:06:29 that's how you get star pieces i'll fucking have to do that so i can make this stupid ass wand uh
02:06:34 sick based yeah well anyway moving on from that uh zibatsu's are cool rest in peace two best friends
02:06:42 or whatever uh yeah there you go that's it all right we've got another here's an exciting voicemail
02:06:47 simply called re final fantasy seven uh okay take it away one thing that i'm reading about about
02:06:55 this final fantasy seven remake that nate will probably never even read about because he has
02:07:00 a tiny brain is uh this one very minor part that i'm like kind of upset about um at the beginning
02:07:07 of the game when you do the mako bombing thing that and you put the timer on the bomb in the
02:07:13 original game wasn't it like 10 minutes you had 10 minutes to like get the fuck out of there
02:07:18 and uh i got out of there like you know first try like it's not that hard but in this game
02:07:23 it gives you like a choice between 20 minutes or 30 minutes and uh chose 20 minutes and still left
02:07:31 with like less than 10 minutes like i left before 10 minutes had even passed what's the
02:07:37 fucking point if like really what really holds your hands with that timer and this new one uh the
02:07:43 boss fight doesn't even count the timer doesn't start until after the scorpion fight is that true
02:07:48 of the game too no no i remember the the the timer starts and then the boss happens like oh
02:07:53 shoot i gotta defeat this guy while the time is going and like the little part where we're sounds
02:07:57 like a good way to build tension in an action indeed it does the little part where jesse hurts
02:08:01 her leg and you go over to savor in the original that was a choice because it was taking time from
02:08:06 your clock you know you were choosing to go rescuer uh in the new one the clock stops during this
02:08:11 scene for this cut scene for no reason the clock stops while you're helping her up it's the little
02:08:17 things to me that reveal that these people don't know what they're doing i don't care that it's the
02:08:21 same people they've lost their touch if that's what's happened it doesn't matter um i don't whatever
02:08:26 it's not all bad but yeah i mean little things like that like the whole game has changed so like
02:08:31 theoretically with like different mechanics that you could make you could design a game where it's
02:08:36 perfectly appropriate to give someone 20 minutes instead of 10 to do x things but they did that
02:08:40 and then also made the game way easier and baby you like if you want if you want to cut those out
02:08:45 just give a little extra time to do the boss and the thing i love like small moral choices that
02:08:52 i actually have to make the idea of like oh i might not get out in time because i don't know how
02:08:56 much longer this is i i but i need to go save jesse uh uh you know what i mean i don't know i feel
02:09:03 like a lot of this is informed by the meta it's because like because everyone knows it's so weird
02:09:08 who is this game for people who have played it before or people who haven't it's i'm very confused
02:09:12 about that it's both that's why it's for it i'll tell you who it's for it's for casuals who played
02:09:16 the game but don't understand it hmm it's for people who it's for people who vaguely remember
02:09:22 Final Fantasy 7 and see the new one and can go oh my god a Final Fantasy 7 remake oh my god
02:09:27 everything's blowing my mind and you know those people will probably love it oh yeah i'm sure
02:09:32 you know all of it i'm fine yeah are you know those people oh that's me i hate myself you got me

02:16:02 it was like funny mm-hmm i see and it is iconic face but yeah we can we could approximate we

02:16:58 in we're back in the um we're doing the um the yearly uh revert to season one mechanics uh the
02:17:04 game sucks again everything is no no no the game is perfect because i am sitting in the dojo uh
02:17:10 holding a katana and people are sparring with me and i have 52 million slime right now and the
02:17:15 slimiest i've ever been oh it's funny because um the uh yeah you have 52 million slime from
02:17:21 sparring or whatever um the the amounts we were fighting over in the slime fest was like
02:17:27 because shamblers had shut down the city and no one had been able to play for like a long time
02:17:31 we literally went with like eight and nine million like you could make that in one day uh but that's
02:17:37 what we had to work with god do i miss the stock market and the stonks god damn well not in season
02:17:43 one there are stocks again oh okay there are new there are new stocks kfc uh uh uh pizza hut and
02:17:49 michael bell taco bell yeah yeah they're they're new they've split they've subdivided
02:17:55 oh i have to bust the trust i don't know if this exists but i would love a yum brand's
02:17:59 pin of some stripe that would be excellent you know you know that's not a bad idea um i might
02:18:06 make one and just see if anyone cares i made oh you know i wanted to make one that was like
02:18:11 like a weather warning for bicarbonate rain yeah good idea good idea like it may be like a yellow
02:18:16 triangle with like a cloud and like maybe the chemical symbol for like bicarbonate soda or
02:18:21 something bicarbonate bicarbonate rain downpour again and i want a pin to reflect yeah i fucked
02:18:27 around with it i didn't settle on a design but maybe i'll make one and see if anyone likes it
02:18:32 that's a good i'd like it i like it yeah i i think that's cool if i had to choose i'd probably get
02:18:36 like slime corp fucking nega slime i do like this red man face a lot t-fap is pretty attractive
02:18:43 uh what what killers what i like are things that you would see if you were in new los angeles
02:18:51 city oh i gotta say i love the slime coin i mean the slime coin of course is kind of number one
02:18:55 that's i mean the slide we could make the slime coin as a pin too if we wanted but like right now
02:19:00 it's just i like it as a coin i'm sick in new los angeles city you would see people wearing
02:19:05 like killer pins rowdy pins of course those people just would be wearing those um you you if someone
02:19:11 were a muck trainer you might see them wearing the muck league badge uh they might have a podron
02:19:16 pin to them as it exists right now though i do have an issue with this i am the so those are the ones
02:19:20 that i i really like thus far in human history i'm the sole producer of slime corp pins anywhere
02:19:26 they are made of paper but they are real and exist and some of you have them uh so the market's
02:19:31 about to be flooded my pins are going to become worthless which is unfortunate for me we're going
